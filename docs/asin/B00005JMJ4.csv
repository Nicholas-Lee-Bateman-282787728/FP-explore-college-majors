It had some fun moments, some introspective things I could relate to, good acting and cinematography. However, I found the ending terrible, and much more could have been done with the very interesting characters she built up. I would have gladly sat through another half hour if the characters came to some new plataeu or deeper understanding of themselves.

Outwardly, Tokyo is a typical bustling metropolis.  But with closer observation, strange and bizarre things come to light.  From crazy TV talk shows, to Buddhist temples, to inexplicable politeness and reserve, the viewer is shown tidbits of Japanese society without either negative or positive commentary.  Coppola allows the viewer to process the information just as the protagonists do.  And these &quot;alien&quot; observations only add to the feeling of being lost in a foreign land.Scarlett Johansson was wonderful.  She displayed such an enchanting &quot;naturalness&quot; thoughout the film.  Her performance, in my opinion, was more impressive than Murray's.",4,Alien nation,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,787,"['One', 'aspect', 'particularly', 'appreciated', 'was', 'observation', 'Japanese', 'life', 'culture', 'foreigner', 'perspective', 'Outwardly', 'Tokyo', 'typical', 'bustling', 'metropolis', 'closer', 'observation', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'things', 'come', 'light', 'crazy', 'TV', 'talk', 'Buddhist', 'temples', 'inexplicable', 'politeness', 'reserve', 'viewer', 'shown', 'tidbits', 'Japanese', 'society', 'negative', 'positive', 'commentary', 'Coppola', 'viewer', 'process', 'information', 'just', 'protagonists', 'do', 'quot', 'quot', 'observations', 'only', 'add', 'feeling', 'being', 'lost', 'foreign', 'land.Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'was', 'wonderful', 'displayed', 'enchanting', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'performance', 'opinion', 'was', 'more', 'impressive', 'Murray']",Lost in Translation
619198,AKV8PGQECV5O7,B00005JMJ4,a consumer,"[11, 19]","This is what happens when Hollywood imitates an indie/art house cinematic effort.  In that respect the film is so lucky, because it has an instant defense to all who criticize it: if you don't like this film, obviously you'd rather be watching ""Dukes of Hazzard"".This film takes a formulaic Hollywood sensibility and gives it a languid, arty presentation.  The slow, slow pace would be okay if it were used to probe into the depths of the character's personalities, but it doesn't--maybe because there's nothing to the characters.  The girl lays around trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life, and the guy is having a mid-life crisis.  Nothing much more than that gets revealed, but compared to all the cardboard supporting characters, the stars seem like real 3-D personalities.The film does even worse with its ""exploration"" of life in a foreign culture.  I checked out this film because one review praised it for its look at the problems of dealing with life in another culture.  Since I've lived overseas for a number of years now, this sounded interesting.  Instead, one gets a series of boilerplate yuks about strange foreign cultures: everyone speaks a bewildering language (imagine!), the interpreter translates 45 foreign words into 3 English words, the Japanese people are short, etc. etc.  Look, the main characters of this movie are in Tokyo for a week or two and they seem completely alienated and devastated by it all--these people should definitely have stayed home!!Another comment about the glacial speed of this movie: was it really necessary for the karaoke scene to go on for so long?  You get the idea after the first song, that these are people in Tokyo amusing themselves with karaoke, that's what Japanese people do, after all (isn't it?).  After the second song, you figure that the point has been even better made, but by the third song, when Bill Murray starts to launch into the Roxy Music tune, barely able to keep from slipping into his Saturday Night Live lounge-crooner mode, you have to wonder what the point is.If you like slow films, check out something by Bergman or Tarkovsky instead.

619200,ADOUBP7AMWGKU,B00005JMJ4,"Adam Cole ""adamjoncole""","[8, 12]","When I went to see this film I was expecting, based on the preview, some crazy caper movie, like Bill Murray's previous duck-out-of-water movie ""The Man Who Knew Too Little."" I love that kind of film so I was quite looking forward to a little simple-minded fun. What I got instead was far from what I expected, but considerably more than I could have hoped for.What I got was a film that truly moved me - for reasons inexplicable to me at the time. What I got was a beautiful visual experience, that left me feeling as if I was actually in the film (a feeling I've never had before with a film). What I got was a story about two characters that I felt I could really relate to and understand on a much closer level than I have seen in other films. What I got was a sense of having seen something truly magical, and when I left the cinema, I felt that I had to see it again. And I did.I've always liked Bill Murray in almost any role he has been in, but he outshone himself this time. Not since ""The Razor's Edge"" have I seen him display so well that he is not just a comedian but an ACTOR of quite considerable talent. There was one scene at the end of the film that particularly demonstrated this. The look on his character's face as he watched his friend Charlotte walking away conveyed so much emotional meaning that I could have sworn I was feeling it too. That part of the film alone was worth seeing and it was only one brilliant scene among many.A lot of reviewers have complained that the film lacked a plot and was ""boring."" I think they missed the point. The plot was in the emotions and the experiences. This was a film about two people lost in a strange place and lost in their own lives. It was a film about developing a special bond with another person that was far more important than any romance could produce. The plot was in the characters. There are no disasters to avert, treasures to find, bombs to defuse or crooks to catch. It was a story that could happen to anyone. Maybe that's one of the reasons why it is so easy to connect with.I would remind people that there are plenty of stories  out there that are classics in which the plot is not so obvious. Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises"" is the perfect example of a story in which there is virtually no overt plot, yet a considerable amount of action is occurring at levels other than those of action. The same could be said for ""Lost In Translation.""Yes, sad to say there are no epic gun battles, sword fights, vampires, computer generated effects or fart jokes in this film. There are no cute little Hobbits to root for. Too bad. If you want fart jokes, catch something by Adam Sandler and such. If you want sword fights and Hobbits, watch the ""Lord of the Rings"" and other such dreck. ""Lost In Translation"" is not a film for everyone. But if you are interested in films where the characters are more important than the effects (e.g., ""Sideways"") then ""Lost In Translation"" will be perfect for you.And one last point. I agree fully with Clint Eastwood when he said that the Oscars were ""Hobbitised"" that year. I cannot understand how films such as ""Lost In Translation"" or ""Mystic River"" could be beaten by an overblown and ultimately empty effects display like ""Return of the King.""",5,Not A Film For Dumb People,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,3258,"['When', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'based', 'preview', 'crazy', 'caper', 'movie', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'previous', 'duck-out-of-water', 'movie', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Little', 'love', 'kind', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'looking', 'forward', 'little', 'simple-minded', 'fun', 'What', 'got', 'instead', 'was', 'far', 'what', 'expected', 'considerably', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'hoped', 'got', 'was', 'film', 'truly', 'moved', 'reasons', 'inexplicable', 'time', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'experience', 'left', 'feeling', 'was', 'actually', 'film', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'film', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'story', 'two', 'characters', 'felt', 'could', 'really', 'relate', 'understand', 'much', 'closer', 'level', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'sense', 'having', 'seen', 'something', 'truly', 'magical', 'when', 'left', 'cinema', 'felt', 'had', 'see', 'again', 'did.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'almost', 'role', 'been', 'time', 'Not', 'Razor', 'Edge', 'have', 'seen', 'display', 'so', 'well', 'not', 'just', 'comedian', 'ACTOR', 'quite', 'considerable', 'talent', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'particularly', 'demonstrated', 'look', 'character', 'face', 'watched', 'friend', 'Charlotte', 'walking', 'away', 'conveyed', 'so', 'much', 'emotional', 'meaning', 'could', 'have', 'sworn', 'was', 'feeling', 'too', 'part', 'film', 'alone', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'many.A', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'film', 'lacked', 'plot', 'was', 'boring', 'think', 'missed', 'point', 'plot', 'was', 'emotions', 'experiences', 'was', 'film', 'two', 'people', 'lost', 'strange', 'place', 'lost', 'own', 'lives', 'was', 'film', 'developing', 'special', 'bond', 'person', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'romance', 'could', 'produce', 'plot', 'was', 'characters', 'are', 'disasters', 'avert', 'treasures', 'find', 'bombs', 'defuse', 'crooks', 'catch', 'was', 'story', 'could', 'happen', 'anyone', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'so', 'easy', 'connect', 'with.I', 'would', 'remind', 'people', 'are', 'plenty', 'stories', 'there', 'are', 'classics', 'plot', 'not', 'so', 'obvious', 'Hemingway', 'Sun', 'Also', 'Rises', 'perfect', 'example', 'story', 'virtually', 'overt', 'plot', 'considerable', 'amount', 'action', 'occurring', 'levels', 'other', 'action', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Yes', 'sad', 'say', 'are', 'epic', 'gun', 'battles', 'sword', 'fights', 'vampires', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'fart', 'jokes', 'film', 'are', 'cute', 'little', 'Hobbits', 'root', 'Too', 'bad', 'want', 'fart', 'jokes', 'catch', 'something', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'such', 'want', 'sword', 'fights', 'Hobbits', 'watch', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'other', 'such', 'dreck', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'are', 'interested', 'films', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'effects', 'e.g.', 'Sideways', 'then', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'you.And', 'one', 'last', 'point', 'agree', 'fully', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'when', 'said', 'Oscars', 'were', 'Hobbitised', 'year', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'films', 'such', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Mystic', 'River', 'could', 'be', 'beaten', 'overblown', 'ultimately', 'empty', 'effects', 'display', 'Return', 'King']",Lost in Translation
619201,A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3,B00005JMJ4,Adam Goldberg,"[11, 12]","The reason I give this dvd 4 instead of 5 stars is that like many of the best movies, its not something I envision most people watching over and over again - like say a stupid comedy or a throwaway action flick.  As a result I view this as a better rental (say once every 3 years) than a purchase.  In any case though, its a great film.  It captures the feeling of being out of place and living in a foreign country really perfectly.  Any one who has ever done it knows that it can be a really traumatic experience.  The isolation invariably leads to a lot of introspection and basically that is what this movie is about: introspection. The actors and director really capture the mood and pace of such an experience really well.  The shots of Japan are memorable.  Furthermore the extras in the dvd are also highly interesting to fans of the film - the documentary is not a piece of cable PR like is often the case and the discussions with bill murray, spike jones, sophia coppalla, et al are really insightful.

619202,A3ONKRWEZMJJUV,B00005JMJ4,"Adrian Duran Sanchez ""Conductista""","[0, 4]","Imposing Tokyo is a city of too much crowded streets and too much empty ones.  Down town surrounded by everlasting lights and continuous movement on every sighting, everyone follows their own path. I suppose after a while living here, you take everything for granted. It may become tedious. Its overwhelming technology constituted and penetrates every skyscraper and advertisement. A night stroll through this marvelous city aside a love one can picture perfect how intimacy can be achieved by huge surroundings of people and endless movement. Why? Romantic love between a man and a woman is a constant of two, a third one means crowd. So, this two are immerse on each other enjoying this touring through Tokyo. The strolling goes on as the characters talk, laugh, and fool around each other. Simple mundane seduction, the unique of it is in the difference of each others persona. In their sorrow and meaningless existence they are aware of this mundane stroll. They fall in love, no longer mundane but unique. Now they are Bob and Charlotte, not that lone Wife and the depressive Actor, what ever his name is (Bob Harris isn't it?). More strolling as the couple gaze at that Big Pink Dinosaur. Some jokes here and there, when at last they understand that they are alone with each other. That's all the comfort one needs. Still surrounded by massive amounts of people strolling through the streets (got the picture?).To cheer you up, to hold you save, still strolling through Tokyo and its overwhelming architecture, the couple feels the bond. What a great time to be with each other! Bond together. Time for a Whisky. Cheers!Wake up, it's late already! Got to work. Where is my Husband? That damn Translator sucks big time! Some fancy actress, I just can't stand her stupid smile! At least I'm getting paid for this commercial. At least there is Tokyo right outside the window. Tonight's plan will take us to one of those popular bars where you can be alone with your friends and have a good time. Karaoke! Now I know you better. I don't want to be alone tonight, so stay with me please? We'll share the sorrow. It's about the dept of your gaze and the sharing of our silence. It pleases me to be with you. Bob and Charlotte. Yours truly!Don't feel sad, we'll come together again. Now Charlotte strolls alone in Tokyo, and Bob impatiently awaits for her to come back to America. Then we'll sketch a dinner or something and begin an affair. Remember the way we where back in Tokyo?No stereotypes, no clich&eacute;s, and by no means the standard romantic comedy formula is used in any to way to cheapens this carefully constructed atmosphere of lonesome existences and frailty of the soul. Reality is at every moment present to express a direct mood of despair. Sweet jokes and mundane speeches, just a man a woman coming together as in real life happens. That's why it's simple but sober script penetrates the viewer with gallantly and emotiveness. Never in this picture a glimpse of hypocrite manipulation is seen to force a tear in the spectator. Sophia Coppola's pace and cinematic composure is perfect and flawless. The acting level is simply splendid. Highly in shape, Bill Murray is the perfect muse, natural, complex, as far as I am concern, this is no acting but a real life person caught in motion. Tender Scarlett Johansson pleases the eye with every gesture and word, sexy and lone, a breathtaking performance my dear. The photography is no post-card but a realistic color depict of the great Tokyo gathered with an exact camera movement. Music to assists the images and increase the great balance achieved in this less that 30 days shooting. A.K.A.: Lost in Translation.And so, the excellent DVD transferring offers DTS sound, Dolby Digital 5.1, A conversation with Sophia and Bill, the Making Of, an extend version of that weird Japanese T.V Show, plus some more goodies.The climax comes when Bob soft spokes some words to Charlotte, gaining an instant smile on her face.

I can not even begin to fathom why ANYONE would even BEGIN to award Lost In Snoozland --- I mean Lost In Translation. I rented this movie over the weekend. It was completely stupid. It was so boring. I sat with my remote in hand constantly on the fast forward button looking for the actual plot to begin. It never did.So my question is, why is this movie being touted as one of the best of 2004? I think every year there has to be a movie that Hollywood embraces to make the rest of America feel stupid. It exists to make those of us who are not part of the Hollywood elite stop and think, &quot;am I not smart enough or deep enough to understand what this movie is saying?&quot;You see my theory is there is this one guy in Hollywood, we'll call him Lou. Lou is probably a washed up old Hollywood power player. Perhaps he was (or still is) a talent agent or head of a prominent studio. Several years ago, Lou was somehow wronged by the Hollywood community. He was able to dust himself off and make it seem as though he survived the cruelty. However, something in Lou's mind snapped. He is bent on revenge. Every year Lou finds the worst movie made and embraces it. He says I LOVE this film. Then Lou sits back and laughs his fool head off as the lemmings of Hollywood follow suit. Every year Lou gets his revenge by watching how DUMB the Hollywood wackos really can be.Now this may seem like an elaborate story but trust me Lou must exist. How else can we describe a movie like Lost In Translation being nominated for Best Picture? How else can Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray receive awards and accolades for the most sleep inducing film in recent years? Just a thought. But the next time you are in a dark movie theater or you own living room and realize that you have no idea why ANYONE would think the snoozer of the film that you are suffering through seems to be such a hit with other people, remember poor old Lou and smile as you picture him with a cigar hanging out of the left corner of his mouth, a wicked smile plastered across his face saying, &quot;Gotcha!&quot; Then just chalk it up to revenge getting the better of us all.",1,LOST IN A NAP,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,2166,"['What', 'horrible', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'begin', 'fathom', 'why', 'ANYONE', 'would', 'even', 'BEGIN', 'award', 'Lost', 'Snoozland', 'mean', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'rented', 'movie', 'weekend', 'was', 'completely', 'stupid', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'sat', 'remote', 'hand', 'constantly', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'looking', 'actual', 'plot', 'begin', 'never', 'did.So', 'question', 'why', 'movie', 'being', 'touted', 'one', 'best', '2004', 'think', 'year', 'there', 'be', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'rest', 'America', 'feel', 'stupid', 'make', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'Hollywood', 'elite', 'stop', 'think', 'quot', 'am', 'not', 'smart', 'enough', 'deep', 'enough', 'understand', 'what', 'movie', 'saying', 'quot', 'see', 'theory', 'one', 'guy', 'Hollywood', ""'ll"", 'call', 'Lou', 'Lou', 'probably', 'washed', 'up', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'power', 'player', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'still', 'talent', 'agent', 'head', 'prominent', 'studio', 'Several', 'years', 'ago', 'Lou', 'was', 'somehow', 'wronged', 'Hollywood', 'community', 'was', 'able', 'dust', 'off', 'make', 'seem', 'survived', 'cruelty', 'However', 'something', 'Lou', 'mind', 'snapped', 'bent', 'revenge', 'year', 'Lou', 'worst', 'movie', 'made', 'LOVE', 'film', 'Then', 'Lou', 'back', 'fool', 'head', 'lemmings', 'Hollywood', 'follow', 'suit', 'year', 'Lou', 'revenge', 'watching', 'how', 'DUMB', 'Hollywood', 'wackos', 'really', 'can', 'be.Now', 'may', 'seem', 'elaborate', 'story', 'trust', 'Lou', 'must', 'exist', 'How', 'else', 'can', 'describe', 'movie', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'being', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'How', 'else', 'can', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'receive', 'awards', 'accolades', 'most', 'sleep', 'inducing', 'film', 'recent', 'years', 'Just', 'thought', 'next', 'time', 'are', 'dark', 'movie', 'theater', 'own', 'living', 'room', 'realize', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'ANYONE', 'would', 'think', 'snoozer', 'film', 'are', 'suffering', 'be', 'such', 'hit', 'other', 'people', 'remember', 'poor', 'old', 'Lou', 'smile', 'picture', 'cigar', 'hanging', 'left', 'corner', 'mouth', 'wicked', 'smile', 'plastered', 'face', 'saying', 'quot', 'Gotcha', 'quot', 'Then', 'just', 'chalk', 'up', 'revenge', 'getting', 'better']",Lost in Translation

At some point of our live, everybody have felt that sensation that despite the fact that we are surrounded by people, we feel alone. That sensation that for some reason we don't fit in a group of people or that we don't belong in a place. Those feelings of loneliness are described in ""Lost In Translation"".This comedy / drama is very similar to a movie made in Hong Kong, ""In The Mood For Love"". In both movies we are witnesses of a relation that goes beyond the physical factor. So at least we must give to Sofia Coppola the credit for making a movie that rejects the typical elements of the romantic comedy. Her screenplay is the most rewarded aspect of the film, also, Bill Murray's performance has gathered some acting prizes as well.""Lost In Translation"" is a must seen to all the fans of the great Bill Murray, one of the finest comedians there are in these days. He gives perhaps his most mature performance to date. On the other hand we have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, a very young actress with a great future, she's only 20 years old, but she already has shown her great potential. Also, she is very beautiful and classy and she has won some awards for her performance in ""Lost In Translation"".Despite all those awards, ""Lost In Translation"" many times gives you the feeling that is more admirable than enjoyable, it's a comedy with a lot of original and interesting situations, but sometimes the pace of the film is slow and reiterative. For those reasons ""Lost In Translation"" is a good movie, but some details prevent this film to be a true classic.

In fact there were too many scenes of Japanese people speaking Japanese for comic purposes - which is unfunny and a tad racist at the end of the day.The cheesy underbelly of Tokyo, with repellent arcades and interminable karaoke sessions were just boring - and no better (to me anyway) than the superficial gatherings in the hotel with the bimbo actress which they were presumably supposed to stand against in stark relief.

619210,A3FVIFL4HGI5CL,B00005JMJ4,Alexiel,"[0, 0]","My review title kind of sums up some of the obnoxious feeling that pervades this film. ""Wow, those Japanese sure are strange and quirky! Look at how different they are from us! It's amazing!"" This kind of attitude reminds me an agape-mouthed tourist whose never left Iowa abroad for the first time. The jokes that come from this may be funny for the Mad TV crowd, but left me with a sour feeling. ""Wow! It takes Bill Murray five minutes to figure out the hooker is saying 'Rip my stockings' because her 'r' sounds like an 'l.' Hilarious!"" Ugh.This movie also trades heavily (I would say shamelessly) on the North American fascination with Tokyo and many things Japanese - the glaring light show of a Ginza, Shinjuku, or Roppongi, the vending machines that dispense panties advertised as ""used by schoolgirls"" for fetishists, the rapid transit rails that are a wonder to behold, the anime, manga, and video game culture, etc. The problem is, this movie views Tokyo, in my view, with the same kind of slack-jawed provincialism as a 14 year old who just finished watching Evangelion. Not good, especially when you're appealing to a crowd with a bit more select tastes.Through this, we see a manipulation of Tokyo as fabulous backdrop that fills a gaping void in the movie - you can imagine this movie would completely fall flat in another locale. While setting is important, I personally don't feel it should overshadow the characters, *particularly* in a (should be) character-driven movie such as this. Okay, we've been treated to the Frommer's Guide to Tokyo onscreen. This is not why I came to see the movie. And certainly not for the type of humor all too prevalent throughout the movie. I half-expected Bill Murray to start stretching out his eyes and murmuring ""Me so solly!"" like some 50s comic.Now, that said, once you get past all this, we come to an interesting character study, and this *is* worthwhile. But I'm not enthralled with the acting as our others, here's why. I felt Scarlett Johanssen was unconvincing in her role (casting an 18 year old, as she was at the time, in this role, was a bad idea in retrospect), and too many of her lines rang false.Bill Murray, on the other hand, delivered a fine performance. Replace Johanssen, you still have a movie. Replace Bill Murray, you have nothing. If I have a fault with Murray here, it's that he may not be stretching himself that much in this role - this sardonic, humorously self-depricating man he plays is not that far off from many of his previous roles.Now, with that said, the writing, while a bit sparse at times (coming from the school that's it is better to say too little than too much) is quite good, some of the best of 2003.

Scarlett Johanssen's character is so far removed from the average movie heroine that its wonderfully appealing and her journey is sentimental but never cheesy.The film, sometimes just from the cinematography and/or music, can bring out completely inexpressible feelings. Talking of which, the soundtrack is great. Dazzling is a perfect word for it: Tokyo is stunning and alluring.

619215,AVAHA06K08ZKK,B00005JMJ4,Alwyn Lau,"[3, 6]","How do you tell when you may've watched a 'post-modern' movie? When it's hard to tell anything else about the film.It's never entirely clear what 2004's Oscar-nominated Lost in Translation - one of Bill Murray's rare ventures into 'serious' acting and Scarlett Johansson's introduction to the Hollywood heavenlies (which wasn't hurt by a 30-second indulgent glimpse of her ample behind right at the film's front) - was trying to get at.Sure 1) we could say, 'Tokyo', but the city was everywhere yet (because of that?) nowhere. Tokyo is a land which drives Americans crazy, a fantasy-arena where life's details and granularity is hopelessly mixed up in triviality, obsessive formality and technological excess, where empty temples co-exist with crowded strip-joints; then again, who cares? One can't help but feel that Japan the nation was merely the medium for a vague pseudo-message not easily deciphered.Or 2) was the show merely about a middle-aged man, Bob, struggling through a week of life in Tokyo and who happened to befriend a philosophy-grad, Charlotte, accompanying her husband on a business trip which leaves her feeling imprisoned in a Tokyo-imposed cage of meaningless activity? Yes, except there is no message here, no moral, no plot, no 'solution', no - one could say - point to the two hours of what seems like two people trying to do nothing but cheer each other up. And they do so via parties, with (cheap) philosophy, through one- and two-liners and, most significantly IMO, by staring at each other.Were these the themes director Sofia Coppola was trying to get at? Staring and quietitude striving to transcend the superficial pauses of an urban chaos which ploughs on and on. Stillness and deliberate thoughtfulness when noise and buzz dominate and when life at home inflicts pain and relational dead-ends (both Bob and Charlotte never seem to end their overseas phone calls happy).Maybe the whole movie was 3) motion-streaming a strange friendship just to see where things led to on their own. Maybe Coppola didn't know where she wanted the movie to head, and she was waiting for Bob and Charlotte to give her the answer i.e. there was no 'director', the script was 'writing itself'. Regardless, Lost in Translation often felt like it's title, so all ye movie-goers raised on clear story progression, be warned.4) There are many other questions one may ask although, again, I'm curious if we were meant to ask them. Were Bob and Charlotte falling in love? If so, what exactly was preventing all-out romance, apart from marital fidelity? If not, then was the movie exploring the boundaries of Platonic affection between people who, for all intents and purposes, seemed drawn to each other (and if so, what's the conclusion?)? And why did Bob 'give in' so easily to a total stranger (so much for fidelity) and how did this figure into the movie (since not much was said about it)? What about Charlotte's long silent peerings into temples and gardens? Did those mean something?5) Perhaps, in the final(?) analysis, Lost in Translation is about friendship - pure but not simple. It's about how friends are made, how a relationship progresses through desire (both sexual and otherwise), how likings and loves adapt, and, ultimately, how we acknowledge the end of a cherished stage (although I'm willing to bet there is no fixed meaning of the final farewell scene; it truly is anybody's guess what the point was, if there was even one).We've all lived through difficult (but relatively short) phases in life which were redeemed on account of an individual whose presence made the occasion mean something, whose words and companionship redefined the experience from one of repulsion to one of warmth and rightness. Perhaps Coppola meant to depict such quiet relational miracles, the metamorphosis of two 'wrongs' (Bob and Charlotte being in Tokyo) into one 'right' (a week-long mutually supportive memory).Lost in Translation, ironically, may really be a movie about being found - at least for a while.",3,Lost but Found,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,4019,"['How', 'do', 'tell', 'when', 'may', ""'ve"", 'watched', ""'post-modern"", 'movie', 'When', 'hard', 'tell', 'anything', 'else', 'film.It', 'never', 'entirely', 'clear', 'what', '2004', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'one', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'rare', 'ventures', ""'serious"", 'acting', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'introduction', 'Hollywood', 'heavenlies', 'was', ""n't"", 'hurt', '30-second', 'indulgent', 'glimpse', 'ample', 'right', 'film', 'front', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'at.Sure', '1', 'could', 'say', 'city', 'was', 'everywhere', 'yet', 'nowhere', 'Tokyo', 'land', 'Americans', 'crazy', 'fantasy-arena', 'where', 'life', 'details', 'granularity', 'hopelessly', 'mixed', 'up', 'triviality', 'obsessive', 'formality', 'technological', 'excess', 'where', 'empty', 'temples', 'co-exist', 'crowded', 'strip-joints', 'then', 'again', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'Japan', 'nation', 'was', 'merely', 'medium', 'vague', 'pseudo-message', 'not', 'easily', 'deciphered.Or', '2', 'was', 'show', 'merely', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'Bob', 'struggling', 'week', 'life', 'Tokyo', 'who', 'happened', 'befriend', 'philosophy-grad', 'Charlotte', 'accompanying', 'husband', 'business', 'trip', 'feeling', 'imprisoned', 'Tokyo-imposed', 'cage', 'meaningless', 'activity', 'Yes', 'message', 'here', 'moral', 'plot', ""'solution"", 'one', 'could', 'say', 'point', 'two', 'hours', 'what', 'like', 'two', 'people', 'trying', 'do', 'nothing', 'cheer', 'other', 'up', 'do', 'so', 'parties', 'cheap', 'philosophy', 'one-', 'two-liners', 'most', 'significantly', 'IMO', 'staring', 'themes', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'Staring', 'quietitude', 'striving', 'transcend', 'superficial', 'pauses', 'urban', 'chaos', 'Stillness', 'deliberate', 'thoughtfulness', 'when', 'noise', 'buzz', 'dominate', 'when', 'life', 'home', 'inflicts', 'pain', 'relational', 'dead-ends', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'never', 'seem', 'end', 'overseas', 'phone', 'happy', '.Maybe', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', '3', 'motion-streaming', 'strange', 'friendship', 'just', 'see', 'where', 'things', 'led', 'own', 'Maybe', 'Coppola', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'wanted', 'movie', 'head', 'was', 'waiting', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'give', 'answer', 'i.e', 'was', ""'director"", 'script', 'was', ""'writing"", 'Regardless', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'often', 'felt', 'title', 'ye', 'movie-goers', 'raised', 'clear', 'story', 'progression', 'be', 'warned.4', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'questions', 'one', 'may', 'ask', 'again', ""'m"", 'curious', 'were', 'meant', 'ask', 'Were', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'falling', 'love', 'so', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'preventing', 'all-out', 'romance', 'apart', 'marital', 'fidelity', 'not', 'then', 'was', 'movie', 'exploring', 'boundaries', 'Platonic', 'affection', 'people', 'who', 'intents', 'purposes', 'seemed', 'drawn', 'other', 'so', 'what', 'conclusion', 'why', 'did', 'Bob', ""'give"", 'so', 'easily', 'total', 'stranger', 'so', 'much', 'fidelity', 'how', 'did', 'figure', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'was', 'said', 'What', 'Charlotte', 'long', 'silent', 'peerings', 'temples', 'gardens', 'Did', 'mean', 'something', '5', 'Perhaps', 'final', 'analysis', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'friendship', 'pure', 'not', 'simple', 'how', 'friends', 'are', 'made', 'how', 'relationship', 'desire', 'sexual', 'otherwise', 'how', 'likings', 'loves', 'adapt', 'ultimately', 'how', 'acknowledge', 'end', 'cherished', 'stage', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'fixed', 'meaning', 'final', 'farewell', 'scene', 'truly', 'anybody', 'guess', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'was', 'even', 'one', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'difficult', 'relatively', 'short', 'life', 'were', 'redeemed', 'account', 'individual', 'presence', 'made', 'occasion', 'mean', 'something', 'words', 'companionship', 'redefined', 'experience', 'one', 'repulsion', 'one', 'warmth', 'rightness', 'Perhaps', 'Coppola', 'meant', 'depict', 'such', 'quiet', 'relational', 'miracles', 'metamorphosis', 'two', ""'wrongs"", 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'being', 'Tokyo', 'one', ""'right"", 'week-long', 'mutually', 'supportive', 'memory', '.Lost', 'Translation', 'ironically', 'may', 'really', 'be', 'movie', 'being', 'found', 'least', 'while']",Lost in Translation

""Lost in Translation"" captures the essence of what the main characters are experiencing during their stay in Tokyo. The movie encourages viewers to feel as lost as John Harris (Bill Murray), an impatient and washed-up American actor who's lost touch with himself and his family, or relate to the lonely young twenty-something wife, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who is intelligent yet unsure about what to do with her life and finds herself in Tokyo because she followed her young and energetic (yet lacking a certain depth) photographer husband on a business trip. John and Charlotte meet at the highly polished hotel they are both staying at and form a unique bond during their week in the impossibly foreign, overwhelmingly urban, hectic and dream-like surroundings of Tokyo. Each scene captures the essence of being both lost in one's surroundings and in one's self. The scenes are designed to embody the sometimes embarassing and funny things that can happen in an unfamiliar culture, or simply capture the powerful bond that Charlotte and John share during their time in Tokyo. No, it's not a romance between Charlotte and John, but they do form a certain love and deep understanding during their week's stay and both begin to find their way a bit easier after meeting each other. Murray and Johansson were a pleasure to watch in this film and very convincing when capturing the essence of the bond that their two characters share.

Did not.Bill Murray's character was bitter and mean, blaming his wife for their crumbling marriage when, to me, he was rather undesirable and hateful. And one subliminal message in the film was blame the wife, she doesnt understand poor Bill M's character, he is a complete mess but it isnt his fault...it's because she is so concerned with interior decorating that he takes up with a Japanese hooker. Oh poor man! No wonder he was drawn to a nubile 19 year old blonde babe ( uhhh..DUH)And he just has to suuuuuuuffffffer.... not at all look at himself or his flaws. It was  humor humor humor ( dark at that) with the premise that he was a bumbling aging misunderstood semi tragic hero.And blah blah blah  we're still  seeing movies with 50 ish leading men connecting with/wooing/wanting/getting girlwomen more than half their age. I know that comment may anger some, and seem like I am putting my issues onto this review, but what I am trying to say is this kind of pairing in movies is so so so common, predictable , rampant and basically a turn off; it did contribute to my disinterest in the story line, though I promise, I tried to like it.  But come on! Only in the movies would a luminous blonde fall for aforementioned ""hero"". I can hear it now: ""But it IS a movie"" I know that, but again, this kind of storyline is so commonplace that when the old guy gets the girl it is never meaningful, it's just a way to market a film by showing a chick in her underwear.I agree with another reviewer who mentioned ethnic stereotyping... much of the film's supposed humor was based on making fun of Japanese language and customs.I want more in a film and especially in the female characters. I just did not believe in their connection or even care, actually.BUT I will say, ( don't want to give it away) the very last scene was lovely, it really was.

With 'Lost in Translation', she proves herself a worthy successor to her father and to my sensibilities, will likely surpass him (if she hasn't already). Bill Murray is already getting 'Oscar' buzz, but who cares about the Oscars. Bill Murray's been a great actor for a long time, and if you didn't believe it before, this film will convince you. Scarlet Johansson has been impressing the indie world for awhile with her talents, and her performance in 'Translation' shines. Only with these performances and the carefully meted out patience of Coppola could such a film as this work, and as it works without any noticeable flaws: it is a marvel.Bill Murray is Bob, a famous actor doing a commercial, and Scarlet Johansson is Charlotte, an educated wife of a working/traveling not-to-bright photographer. Both are questioning the paths of their lives and given ample time to do it in the overwhelmingly alien Tokyo. Much of the films loneliness is conveyed with long shots of cityscape, almost always through windows, emphasizing the smallness and separateness of the characters. The fact that no one speaks English only adds to Bob and Charlotte's clumsy aloneness. They are literally estranged from the world. For Bob, his wife might prove a source of comfort, but the long distance calls to her prove even more alienating; their understanding of each other has developed into an unshakable pattern. For Charlotte and her husband, she admits that she doesn't know who she's married, and he is too oblivious to see her struggle; his blindness emphasized by the fact that he always wears sunglasses. When Bob and Charlotte meet, becoming fast friends, it's as if the world circles around them, becoming an impregnable neon capsule. But real life does invade, and the realization of their lives together is disturbingly dour. Unbelievably, Ms. Coppola dodges all the Hollywood clich&eacute;s - which in a film of this type is like crossing a mine-field with a herd of cattle - and somehow avoids being overly sentimental or preachy. The characters simply live their lives across the screen - practically just playing themselves. Bill to Bob, Scarlett to Charlotte; in one moment, there is almost a sketch comedy (harkening back to SNL days) of Bob trying to communicate with an elderly Japanese woman. As he goes through all his Bill Murray antics, some extras in the background begin laughing. This hilarious moment becomes an almost painful awakening to the powerful truths of loneliness - especially in such a 'killer' industry - as  the scene connects the fictional to the real; the Bob to the Bill. All that looking through glass and seeing reflections becomes so much like looking through a camera, or watching the stranger of one's own self in a mirror. Like the play within the play of Hamlet, they are acting out their own lives. And the end result is astounding.",5,Shining Stars,1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,3020,"['Early', 'attempts', 'dislike', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'nepotistic', 'reasons', 'failed', 'half-way', 'watching', 'first', 'major', 'outing', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', ""'Lost"", 'Translation', 'worthy', 'successor', 'father', 'sensibilities', 'will', 'likely', 'surpass', ""n't"", 'already', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'already', 'getting', 'buzz', 'who', 'Oscars', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'been', 'great', 'actor', 'long', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'before', 'film', 'will', 'convince', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'been', 'impressing', 'indie', 'world', 'awhile', 'talents', 'performance', ""'Translation"", 'shines', 'Only', 'performances', 'carefully', 'meted', 'out', 'patience', 'Coppola', 'could', 'such', 'film', 'work', 'noticeable', 'flaws', 'marvel.Bill', 'Murray', 'Bob', 'famous', 'actor', 'doing', 'commercial', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'Charlotte', 'educated', 'wife', 'working/traveling', 'not-to-bright', 'photographer', 'are', 'questioning', 'paths', 'lives', 'given', 'ample', 'time', 'do', 'overwhelmingly', 'alien', 'Tokyo', 'Much', 'films', 'loneliness', 'conveyed', 'long', 'shots', 'cityscape', 'almost', 'always', 'windows', 'emphasizing', 'smallness', 'separateness', 'characters', 'fact', 'one', 'English', 'only', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'clumsy', 'aloneness', 'are', 'literally', 'estranged', 'world', 'Bob', 'wife', 'might', 'prove', 'source', 'comfort', 'long', 'distance', 'prove', 'even', 'more', 'alienating', 'understanding', 'other', 'developed', 'unshakable', 'pattern', 'Charlotte', 'husband', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'married', 'too', 'oblivious', 'see', 'struggle', 'blindness', 'emphasized', 'fact', 'always', 'sunglasses', 'When', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'meet', 'becoming', 'fast', 'friends', 'world', 'becoming', 'impregnable', 'neon', 'capsule', 'real', 'life', 'invade', 'realization', 'lives', 'together', 'disturbingly', 'dour', 'Unbelievably', 'Ms.', 'Coppola', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'type', 'crossing', 'mine-field', 'herd', 'cattle', 'somehow', 'avoids', 'being', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'preachy', 'characters', 'simply', 'live', 'lives', 'screen', 'practically', 'just', 'playing', 'Bill', 'Bob', 'Scarlett', 'Charlotte', 'one', 'moment', 'almost', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'harkening', 'back', 'SNL', 'days', 'Bob', 'trying', 'communicate', 'elderly', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'antics', 'extras', 'background', 'begin', 'laughing', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'almost', 'painful', 'awakening', 'powerful', 'truths', 'loneliness', 'especially', 'such', ""'killer"", 'industry', 'scene', 'fictional', 'real', 'Bob', 'Bill', 'looking', 'glass', 'seeing', 'reflections', 'so', 'much', 'looking', 'camera', 'watching', 'stranger', 'one', 'own', 'self', 'mirror', 'play', 'play', 'Hamlet', 'are', 'acting', 'out', 'own', 'lives', 'end', 'result', 'astounding']",Lost in Translation

619222,A5S3BAWLNT10P,B00005JMJ4,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Although ""Lost in Translation"" stars Bill Murray, it's not one of his mainstream comedies but an - often humorous - offbeat love story, or friendship story, or lost soul story. It's the fact that you end up not quite sure which that is a major part of its charm.Longtime filmgoers may remember Richard Linklater's 1995 ""Before Sunrise"", which starred Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as an American man and a French girl who meet and develop a romantic relationship over the space of a few hours while he's backpacking through Europe. It's a film that I quite liked. But ""Lost in Translation"" is not only a similar movie. It's a better and more complex one. ""Before Dawn"" was sometimes a little too in love with its own wordiness.Sofia Coppola's script for ""Lost in Translation"" is fairly minimalist, leaving plenty of room for Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson to develop their relationship through a look, a gesture, a moment of silence. And then there are the added complications. Murray's character Bob Harris is facing a mid-life crisis. Johanssen's Charlotte is in her early to mid-twenties. Both are married.Bob is a slightly over the hill actor who - he tells Charlotte - could be at home doing a play but is in Tokyo to do an ad for whisky for 2 million dollars. Charlotte is the wife of a fashion photographer, played by Giovanni Ribisi who's in town to do a shoot. Charlotte's been married two years, and is beginning to think she doesn't really know who her husband is. Bob has been married for 25 years and it's a marriage that seems to exist for the sake of the children. During their cross world phone calls neither he nor his wife seem to be very open with one another emotionally.Both characters are jet-lagged and suffering from insomnia. In the early hours of the morning they find themselves sitting next to one another in the hotel bar, and they begin to get to know one another, something that probably would not have happened had they not been adrift, strangers in a strange land.And to them at least Tokyo is a strange land. Charlotte feels the alienation of the outsider. Bob's cultural collisions are - as one would expect when Bill Murray is playing the character - somewhat more amusing. Some of them, notably a session shooting photographs for the whiskey campaign, are ad-libbed by Murray and the Japanese cast. In another scene a Japanese prostitute sent to his room by his gracious hosts won't take no for an answer, and seems determined that he should lick her tights or lip her tights. It takes him a while to catch on.A Japanese character nicknamed Charlie Brown singing the Sex Pistols ""God Save the Queen"" in a karaoke bar, does - after all -have potentially humorous overtones. And the film's not any less satirical in its portrayal of many of the Western characters, including a Western lady jazz singer in the hotel bar, a Hollywood actress in Japan to promote an action movie in which she co-starred with Keanu Reeves, or even Bob himself. One encounter between Bob and the jazz singer, and its after-effects, are simultaneously stinging, funny and poignant.Bob stays in Tokyo a few extra days to appear on an absurd TV chat show. Charlotte is left alone as her husband leaves town for a shoot. They begin to hang out together. They begin to realise that despite the age difference, and their different places in life they are experiencing very similar self-doubts. And they like each other. A lot. But where are they going to go with it? I'm not going to give much of that away, but it's an extremely sensitive portrayal of a budding relationship between what is - in some ways only - an odd couple.",5,Lost Souls,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,3637,"['Lost', 'Translation', 'stars', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'not', 'one', 'mainstream', 'comedies', 'often', 'humorous', 'offbeat', 'love', 'story', 'friendship', 'story', 'lost', 'soul', 'story', 'fact', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'major', 'part', 'charm.Longtime', 'filmgoers', 'may', 'remember', 'Richard', 'Linklater', '1995', 'Sunrise', 'starred', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'American', 'man', 'French', 'girl', 'who', 'develop', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'space', 'few', 'hours', 'backpacking', 'Europe', 'film', 'quite', 'liked', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'not', 'only', 'similar', 'movie', 'better', 'more', 'complex', 'one', 'Dawn', 'was', 'sometimes', 'little', 'too', 'love', 'own', 'wordiness.Sofia', 'Coppola', 'script', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'fairly', 'minimalist', 'leaving', 'plenty', 'room', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'develop', 'relationship', 'look', 'gesture', 'moment', 'silence', 'then', 'are', 'added', 'complications', 'Murray', 'character', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'facing', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'Johanssen', 'Charlotte', 'early', 'mid-twenties', 'are', 'married.Bob', 'slightly', 'hill', 'actor', 'who', 'Charlotte', 'could', 'be', 'home', 'doing', 'play', 'Tokyo', 'do', 'ad', 'whisky', '2', 'million', 'dollars', 'Charlotte', 'wife', 'fashion', 'photographer', 'played', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'who', 'town', 'do', 'shoot', 'Charlotte', 'been', 'married', 'two', 'years', 'beginning', 'think', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'who', 'husband', 'Bob', 'been', 'married', '25', 'years', 'marriage', 'exist', 'sake', 'children', 'cross', 'world', 'phone', 'wife', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'open', 'one', 'emotionally.Both', 'characters', 'are', 'jet-lagged', 'suffering', 'insomnia', 'early', 'hours', 'morning', 'find', 'sitting', 'next', 'one', 'hotel', 'bar', 'begin', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'something', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'adrift', 'strangers', 'strange', 'land.And', 'least', 'Tokyo', 'strange', 'land', 'Charlotte', 'alienation', 'outsider', 'Bob', 'cultural', 'collisions', 'are', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'when', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'playing', 'character', 'somewhat', 'more', 'amusing', 'notably', 'session', 'shooting', 'photographs', 'whiskey', 'campaign', 'are', 'ad-libbed', 'Murray', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'scene', 'Japanese', 'prostitute', 'sent', 'room', 'gracious', 'hosts', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'answer', 'determined', 'should', 'lick', 'tights', 'lip', 'tights', 'while', 'catch', 'Japanese', 'character', 'nicknamed', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'singing', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'God', 'Save', 'Queen', 'karaoke', 'bar', '-have', 'potentially', 'humorous', 'overtones', 'film', 'not', 'less', 'satirical', 'portrayal', 'many', 'Western', 'characters', 'including', 'Western', 'lady', 'jazz', 'singer', 'hotel', 'bar', 'Hollywood', 'actress', 'Japan', 'promote', 'action', 'movie', 'co-starred', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'even', 'Bob', 'One', 'encounter', 'Bob', 'jazz', 'singer', 'after-effects', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'stinging', 'funny', 'poignant.Bob', 'stays', 'Tokyo', 'few', 'extra', 'days', 'appear', 'absurd', 'TV', 'chat', 'show', 'Charlotte', 'left', 'alone', 'husband', 'town', 'shoot', 'begin', 'hang', 'out', 'together', 'begin', 'realise', 'age', 'difference', 'different', 'places', 'life', 'are', 'experiencing', 'very', 'similar', 'self-doubts', 'like', 'other', 'lot', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'go', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'much', 'away', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'budding', 'relationship', 'what', 'ways', 'only', 'odd', 'couple']",Lost in Translation

The first half hour consists of the lead roles living frustratingly dull lives in Tokyo. 5 minutes of their monotony would have conveyed the point, but no Coppola had to beat the horse to a bloody stump presumably because she was so dazzled with the lights of Tokyo.But I suffered through those 30 minutes hoping eventually a movie would break out. When the two lead characters actually meet, it appears to brighten... for about 5 seconds. Then we encunter a strange journey of characters sharing their boredom and absolutely no substance. Imagine sitting in a plain white room, with no color, and a stranger sits beside you saying &quot;I'm bored, you?&quot; You get almost 2 hours of this.If the lead characters had bothered to explore why they are so bored with their lives and thus grown from knowing and confiding in each other, this movie would have had a chance of meaningful existence. All we can guess (and guessing is all we can do) is that Bob (Murray) is estranged from his wife and kids (they don't even want to talk to him on the phone), reduced to pimping his acting talents in foreign tv commercials and not in charge of his life anymore. And Charlotte is neglected wife and privileged Philosophy grad who suddenly discovers Philosophy did not provide a path to a rewarding career (surprise surprise). But why has Bob lost touch with his family? What worth does Charlotte have besides being a trophy wife? What meaningful existence do these two individuals have?The movie should have answered those questions. Instead it looks more like a beautiful travelogue dazzling us with the sparkling lights of Tokyo.It's a poor attempt at Art House pretention, overrated by a Hollywood crowd that lost touch with average people decades ago.If you want a truly good soul searching story see UNDER A TUSCAN SUN instead.

A very slow beginning finds Bill Murray out of his depth in Tokyo as a flagging actor promoting a brand of whiskey. Anyone who has ever been to Tokyo will know it is NOT a very visitor friendly place, from the point of view of little, or no maps, tourist information, direction signs, assistance, or even menu's printed in English (or any other language except Japanese for that matter) and Ms Copola tries hard to portray this, and the quirky Japanese culture on screen at every given moment. Sadly though, this, and the gentle, if unlikely romantic chemistry between this lost actor in a failing marriage, and young newlywed unsure of her decision or life in general, that could be full of hilarious nuances just doesn't come across. I found myself skipping forward just to see if ANYTHING was going to happen, but was left feeling like a waste of just over 1hr 40 mins.

I expected the two stars, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, to actually make a break from their partners and lives and flee Tokyo.  The reality of the film was much different.By and large, ""Lost in Translation"" is a study in human behaviour.  It provides the film goer with an inside view of the interaction between a middle aged man and a twenty something girl.  Their worlds and backgrounds are very different but they come together in Tokyo where they both share a common puzzlement with Japanese culture as well as similar degrees of dislocation with their respective spouses.Although the film moves slowly and has no real plot, it remains compelling.  Will the couple become sexually entangled?  If so, how will they deal with their partners?  Will the couple arrange to see more of each in the future?  None of these questions is answered with clarity.  The film seems to roll forward in slow motion with the audience acting like voyeurs to private lives.  The film becomes quite engaging as the viewer is almost hypnotised by the manoeuvrings of the couple.See this film as a means of providing insights to human behaviour in a world far more real than the usual offerings of Hollywood.",4,Hypnotising,1075075200,"01 26, 2004",2004,1334,"['Lost', 'Translation', 'was', 'different', 'expectations', 'had', 'previously', 'seen', 'film', 'trailer', 'expected', 'movie', 'greater', 'action', 'expected', 'two', 'stars', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'actually', 'make', 'break', 'partners', 'lives', 'flee', 'Tokyo', 'reality', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'different.By', 'large', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'study', 'human', 'behaviour', 'film', 'goer', 'inside', 'view', 'interaction', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'twenty', 'something', 'girl', 'worlds', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'come', 'together', 'Tokyo', 'where', 'share', 'common', 'puzzlement', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'as', 'well', 'similar', 'degrees', 'dislocation', 'respective', 'film', 'slowly', 'real', 'plot', 'compelling', 'Will', 'couple', 'become', 'sexually', 'entangled', 'so', 'how', 'will', 'deal', 'partners', 'Will', 'couple', 'arrange', 'see', 'more', 'future', 'None', 'questions', 'answered', 'clarity', 'film', 'roll', 'forward', 'slow', 'motion', 'audience', 'acting', 'voyeurs', 'private', 'lives', 'film', 'quite', 'engaging', 'viewer', 'almost', 'hypnotised', 'manoeuvrings', 'couple.See', 'film', 'means', 'providing', 'insights', 'human', 'behaviour', 'world', 'far', 'more', 'real', 'usual', 'offerings', 'Hollywood']",Lost in Translation
619234,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JMJ4,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 8]","Pulling up this product to post my review I found myself a little shocked at the very low overall rating this film has received.  148 three-star reviews?  227 two-star reviews?  572 one-star reviews?  Really?  I can't help but wonder how this marvelous film can receive such little love.  Sure, it has 728 five-star reviews (729 if you count mine) but the fact that it has nearly 1,000 mediocre-to-bad ratings is shocking to me, in a bad way.  How could people `not get' this movie?  I think that reviewer Greg Frayser was right; people just `don't get it'.That is sad, because what Sophia Coppola has done here is create and deliver a touching and poignant look at humanity at its purest, which is something we rarely see today.A lot of times we see raw and honest portrayals of the dark side of humanity when we look at intelligent cinema.  All too often our own realistic brutality is splashed across the screen, bringing us closer to our very own demons.  I applaud filmmakers brave enough to ascertain the notion that honesty is the best policy, willing to expose us for who we are without a care for the audience reaction.  This pays off extremely well for some, and I have to admit that I have always gravitated towards the darker corners of the cinematic experience.  I feel the need though, especially after seeing all the negative response to this film, to single out Coppola for doing the exact opposite.  Instead of focusing on the parts of us we want to hide from, Coppola exposes the purity that is in most of us; giving us a breath of fresh air in a society fixated on clich&eacute;s and fantastical distortions of reality.  `Lost in Translation' is a beautiful and honest account of two people who, simply put, fill and need within one another.Both Bob and Charlotte are in a strange place, both literally and figuratively.  They are both in Tokyo, so there's the `literal' strange place, but they are also both in a difficult and confusing emotional state within their own lives.  Bob, an actor, is lost in his own aspirations.  He isn't sure why he does what he does.  He seems almost apathetic, but it's not apathy that is slowly killing him; it's an emptiness he cannot quite understand.  Charlotte, who is traveling with her husband (who is working), is just as lost.  Her marriage is new yet feeling tired and her husband's friends and personality make her feel out of place.  When you are already empty and alone then strange places can feel like prisons as apposed to adventures.  Both Bob and Charlotte find themselves resenting the absurdity of their surroundings because, in their state, everything is void of meaning.But by chance they meet, and they bond, and soon they find that there is purpose.Sophia Coppola is a personal favorite of mine.  She has only made three films so far but all three have been extremely thought-provoking and intelligent, and wildly creative.  I love her style, which is unique and visionary.  The word auteur is not thrown around carelessly, but I would toss that word in her direction because she has proven with just three movies to have her own distinct and poignant vision.And the way she works with actors is a dream!Bill Murray is a great comedian, one who I adore in nearly everything.  This performance will go down in history as his greatest achievement.  I only wish this had netted him the Oscar (much better than Penn's hammy victory) for his performance is so rich with meaning and depth.  He really understood how to use his unique brand of deadpan humor to create a man who is very real and very personable.  Don't even get me started on Scarlett Johansson's lack of an Oscar nomination here, for in my opinion she gave THE PERFORMANCE OF 2003.  She matches Murray scene for scene, but the natural flourishes she adds to her scenes elevate her slightly above him in my opinion.  Just watch the way she adds a flinch or a chuckle here and there, adding color and individuality to such a beautifully fleshed out character.There are few films that can reach this level of earnest beauty.

This film is extremely different from most movies made nowadays; its plot isn't its main driving force, rather the dialogue is why we choose to see it. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansenn both do wonderful jobs in their roles of two lonely Americans in the world's most congested city.Murray plays Bob Harris, a washed up movie star who has been reduced to endorsing whiskey and appearing on crappy talk shows. His latest job has broght him to Tokyo to film a commercial. His marriage is in trouble, and his kids have &quot;gotten used to their father being away&quot;. Meanwhile, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansenn) is a young woman with a workaholic husband (Giovani Ribisi) and an affinity for walking around her hotel room without pants on. She recently graduated college with a degree in philosophy, and she has no idea of what to do with her life. John, her husband, is a photographer who has a bunch of jobs going on in Tokyo. Charlotte came with him to spend time with him, but he is so busy that he only talks to her when he is getting new equipment. It doesn't help that an old friend of his (Anna Farris) is in town, as she draws attention away from Charlotte. Anyway, Bob and Charlotte soon meet, and a friendship develops. They simultaneously have a physical attraction to each other, as well as a sort of father/daughter relationship going on. They go around Tokyo together having little adventures, and at the end of the night they each return to their seperate rooms.There is also a comedic element to the film. In a sense, its Seinfeld-esque because most of the humor is stuff that one usually doesn't think about, although it is not laugh-out-loud humor. It will make you chuckle when you see these two Americans trying to blend into their surroundings. For instance, all of the hotel clothes seem to small for Bob, Charlotte goes places she doesn't understand because they are popular with the Japanese residents, and the talk show host, who is apparantly the Johnny Carson of Japan, who invites Bob onto his show is very creepy/flamboyant/annoying.This is not a film for action lovers.

Sadly, that is the best thing about this patronising, dull, painfully unimaginative movie.Since red tape makes it very hard to actually film projects like this in Japan, the majority of the film is shot inside a hotel room (allegedly in Tokyo). If you want genuinely thought-provoking insight on Japan, watch Chris Marker's landmark documentary 'Sans Soleil', cause this is the work of an average filmmaker with limited insight, trading on a famous name. At least Nicholas Cage had the good grace to change his name, rather than just ride the Coppola coattails. .  .Back to the film - there is little chemistry between the main actors, and there are mere glimpses of the country where the film is supposedly shot. A trip to Kyoto is a five-second,  tourist-board type stereotyped shot. The 'humour' is sub-Benny Hill standard - Japanese people are all short, can't speak English - and can't pronounce their R's properly.

619238,A3LXYUYLV523ZD,B00005JMJ4,Andrius Uzkalnis,"[9, 13]","To me, this film was an elegant, understated and highly accomplished masterpiece. I do not blame those who are dissapointed: it is like those things in life that you either love or hate.I will not say something like &quot;oh they just don't get it&quot;, because this would imply that I am somehow more clever and insightful than those who disliked it. No I am not. It is just my taste is different. Let me give you an example: I dislike Robin Williams, in fact I think that he is a shallow and one-dimensional comedian. Is it because I &quot;don't get&quot; his jokes? No. I do get his jokes, and many of them are funny. I just don't like him. He annoys me, just like Steve Martin does.Now, back to this film - and here comes another example of different people liking different things. I love Japan (although I do understand that in this film it serves only as a background - incredibly rich, a tapestry of a background - but still only a background), but I understand and accept that many people do not. I love and adore Japanese food and their cold tea from wending machines and their trains; but so many people are left cold by this. And it is OK - because I am also left cold by many things that excite others.I find Scarlett Johansson very beautiful (in this not-so-dazzling way) and her acting razor-sharp; in fact, I think she shines even brighter than Bill Murray in this film. I am also amazed that it took so many years for Western filmmakers to realize that an unfulfilled love can also be an interesting story.I love that this movie does not have an answer. And I don't mind staring through hotel window: I did that in Tokyo myself, and I did the same in many much stranger places: Accra in Ghana, Vladivostok in Russia, Nida in Lithuania. Some of the most interesting ideas (well, for me anyway) I had at the time when I was staring through hotel windows.",5,I loved this film - but can see why others did not.,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,1870,"['film', 'was', 'elegant', 'understated', 'highly', 'accomplished', 'masterpiece', 'do', 'not', 'blame', 'who', 'are', 'dissapointed', 'things', 'life', 'love', 'hate.I', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'something', 'quot', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'quot', 'would', 'imply', 'am', 'somehow', 'more', 'clever', 'insightful', 'who', 'disliked', 'am', 'not', 'just', 'taste', 'different', 'Let', 'give', 'example', 'dislike', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'fact', 'think', 'shallow', 'one-dimensional', 'comedian', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'quot', 'jokes', 'do', 'get', 'jokes', 'many', 'are', 'funny', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'just', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'does.Now', 'back', 'film', 'here', 'example', 'different', 'people', 'liking', 'different', 'things', 'love', 'Japan', 'do', 'understand', 'film', 'only', 'background', 'incredibly', 'rich', 'tapestry', 'background', 'still', 'only', 'background', 'understand', 'accept', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'love', 'adore', 'Japanese', 'food', 'cold', 'tea', 'wending', 'machines', 'trains', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'left', 'cold', 'OK', 'am', 'also', 'left', 'cold', 'many', 'things', 'excite', 'others.I', 'find', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'very', 'beautiful', 'not-so-dazzling', 'way', 'acting', 'razor-sharp', 'fact', 'think', 'even', 'brighter', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'film', 'am', 'also', 'amazed', 'took', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'Western', 'filmmakers', 'realize', 'unfulfilled', 'love', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'interesting', 'story.I', 'love', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'answer', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'staring', 'hotel', 'window', 'did', 'Tokyo', 'did', 'same', 'many', 'much', 'stranger', 'places', 'Accra', 'Ghana', 'Vladivostok', 'Russia', 'Nida', 'Lithuania', 'most', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'well', 'anyway', 'had', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'staring', 'hotel', 'windows']",Lost in Translation
619239,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005JMJ4,Andy Orrock,"[1, 1]","Sofia Coppola wrote the ""Lost in Translation"" script with Bill Murray in mind.  Then, she peppered him for almost a year to get him to commit to the film.  She went through trusted intermediaries, wooed him with gifts, letters, the works.Thank goodness the private Bill Murray (a shy, reclusive individual 180 degress different than his usual on-screen persona) finally relented to Ms. Coppola's very subtle charisma and wiles.  Turns out she did know best:  Murray's take as fading Hollywood star Bob Harris is the role of a lifetime.  If Murray doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for 'Lost' (after getting jobbed for 'Rushmore'), it will be nothing short of criminal.In stories that appeared in the New York Times and elsewhere around the time of the national release of this film, there was talk of Ms. Coppola's original treatment of this film, and how - as a 10-page draft - it seemed too slight to transform into an art-house film.But, in simplicity, there is brilliance.  The powerhouse scene of the movie is Murray's combined commercial/photo shoot in Tokyo.  The New York Times reports that the scene came about as follows:- Ms. Coppola - who possesses a deep knowledge of all things Japan thanks to other business interests there - enivisioned the scene between the Japanese director and Murray.- She scripted *in English* the ""coaching"" that the Japanese director gives to Murray prior to the first take.  It's filled with purposely ridiculous emotional outpourings of the deep sentiments that Suntory Whiskey will arouse in you.- She asked a friend to translate the monologue into Japanese.- She never revealed to Murray the monologue's content and instructed the translator to be oblique and perfunctory (boy, is she ever) when providing him with the on-screen translation.The rest is just great ad-lib acting by Murray.  His confusion is genuine.  The improvisational stuff he comes up with in the subsequent photo shoot is pure magic.  Only Bill Murray could pull it off with such perfect aplomb.Let's hope the academy recognizes this brilliance and rewards it next Spring.",5,Bill Murray's best film & a triumph for Sofia Coppola,1069804800,"11 26, 2003",2003,2094,"['Sofia', 'Coppola', 'wrote', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'script', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'mind', 'Then', 'peppered', 'almost', 'year', 'get', 'commit', 'film', 'went', 'trusted', 'intermediaries', 'wooed', 'gifts', 'letters', 'works.Thank', 'goodness', 'private', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'shy', 'reclusive', 'individual', '180', 'degress', 'different', 'usual', 'on-screen', 'persona', 'finally', 'relented', 'Ms.', 'Coppola', 'very', 'subtle', 'charisma', 'wiles', 'out', 'did', 'know', 'best', 'Murray', 'take', 'fading', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'role', 'lifetime', 'Murray', ""n't"", 'least', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', ""'Lost"", 'getting', 'jobbed', ""'Rushmore"", 'will', 'be', 'nothing', 'short', 'criminal.In', 'stories', 'appeared', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'elsewhere', 'time', 'national', 'release', 'film', 'was', 'talk', 'Ms.', 'Coppola', 'original', 'treatment', 'film', 'how', '10-page', 'draft', 'seemed', 'too', 'slight', 'transform', 'art-house', 'film.But', 'simplicity', 'brilliance', 'powerhouse', 'scene', 'movie', 'Murray', 'combined', 'commercial/photo', 'shoot', 'Tokyo', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'scene', 'came', 'about', 'Ms.', 'Coppola', 'who', 'deep', 'knowledge', 'things', 'Japan', 'thanks', 'other', 'business', 'interests', 'there', 'enivisioned', 'scene', 'Japanese', 'director', 'Murray.-', 'scripted', '*in', 'English*', 'coaching', 'Japanese', 'director', 'Murray', 'prior', 'first', 'take', 'filled', 'purposely', 'ridiculous', 'emotional', 'outpourings', 'deep', 'sentiments', 'Suntory', 'Whiskey', 'will', 'arouse', 'you.-', 'asked', 'friend', 'translate', 'monologue', 'Japanese.-', 'never', 'revealed', 'Murray', 'monologue', 'content', 'instructed', 'translator', 'be', 'oblique', 'perfunctory', 'boy', 'ever', 'when', 'providing', 'on-screen', 'translation.The', 'rest', 'just', 'great', 'ad-lib', 'acting', 'Murray', 'confusion', 'genuine', 'improvisational', 'stuff', 'up', 'subsequent', 'photo', 'shoot', 'pure', 'magic', 'Only', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'such', 'perfect', 'aplomb.Let', 'hope', 'academy', 'brilliance', 'rewards', 'next', 'Spring']",Lost in Translation

When I went to Montreal, Quebec I somewhat felt the way Bill Murray's character went through.  On the otherhand, since I had studied French from grade school to grade nine, I have to say that Ontario's education towards French sucks!  I could not speak nor understand much of what the French people were saying.  However, I were able to read French so I managed to find my way.I'm not quite sure why a review said that it was ""hilarious"".  Is it because it's funny to see other people go through this turmoil of being lost and not speaking the native language?  I would feel embarrassed if I were to laugh at another person just because of language and cultural differences.  Hee hee Kinda reminds me of how my country, ""Canada"" was named... ^_^;;;Perhaps it was a cultural shock for most foreigners who have not visited Asian areas to find it so different?  Video arcades in asian malls and plazas in Toronto have many of the games of when Scarlett's character was wandering through in Japan.  I only wish we had a UFO Catcher that actually has the cute anime ufo plushies! XD  Karaoke is very popular in Japan and it's gaining popularity here in Toronto.  It's just expensive especially at Pacific Mall. T_T;I thought this movie was excellently protrayed as a third-person being lost in a completely different world.  The only downfall was that there was not very much of a story.  Bill and Scarlett would always meet and drink alcohol.  Personally I did not think drowning yourself in alcohol would be a good idea especially if you are in a different country where you do not know much of the laws.  You might get yourself into trouble but you may not remember much as you were drunk! =P  I guess that is the western's culture of drinking to loosen up and whatnot.This was the first film I have seen by Sofia Coppola and thought she did good in the directing but the story... there wasn't much there.

I've tried to enjoy it, tried to search for the film's deeper meanings, well, there aren't any believe me. If the film's theme is just The finding of good company even in a strange world, The solace one finds in another in loneliness,then I would have to say that it is very poorly done.The story is basically about a famous American actor who got an advertising job in Tokyo, but when he got there he is alienated by the Japanese culture and had some difficulties communicating, but then he met a woman named Charolett, who also feel the same way. Well, first I have to say something about the acting, it's B-A-D. Bill Murray, in the entire film has nothing but a depressed look on him. He showed almost no character transformation, at least not in his acting. He did not get more and more cheerful, but continues to ""get lost"" in his loneliness. The whole film did not give me a feeling of comfort, since the message is ""The solace one finds in another in loneliness"" and therefore it's suppose to be comforting. But after I watche the movie it left me with an empty feeling that I even cried. Because the message the movie gave me is that life is empty and meaningless, that even in such a gorgeous city, you can't be happy and find things you enjoy. I also felt tramendously lost, lost in wandering what the purpose of life is. Lost in feeling that there's always something missing in life.The other thing is the Asian discrimination. Like another reviewer said, the two protagonists never managed to learn about their surroundings, never bothered to learn to speak Japanese because they just assumed that everybody knows how to speak English. If that is not a sense of superiority, then I don't know what is. Through their eyes, the Japanese people seemed extremely uncool, they are silly, stupid, couldn't say the ""Rs"" right, and have no artistic talent. All these things are discrimination and racisim. And I don't find it the least bit funny. So yeah, the protagonists wanna get the hell outta there, I would too. But the reason I received was not because they are so alienated, but that the place itself was so incredibly stupid to stay in. And this is also shown in the plot too, for example Bob and Charolett complained about cooking their own food.Overall, I cannot understand why this film actually touched the Oscars, I guess once again I can say that the critics are mindless idiots. Also I just have to say to you guys, don't persume you know a culture or a country just because you've read books on it, studied it or watched it on TV. Because all those things can be biased. Go to the country, spend time there, and you may be deeply surprised.

619245,A2EL3990HXOMZB,B00005JMJ4,Antonio Robert,"[1, 3]","Sofia Coppola's second feature film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; skillfully and stylishly depicts joint alienation of two improbable American soulmates, temporarily dwelling in a splashy Tokyo hotel. In the material-crazy world, actor Bob Harris (the excellent Bill Murray) and ex-philosophy student Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, just 18 in her breakthrough performance) gradually discover they have something in common. They don't lack money, they feel lost among people they do not understand -- both literally and opinion-wise.The film is deliberately slow-paced, atmospheric rather than plot-driven, which is not a bad thing at all. But the problem is that there's not much substance under the glossy, professionally-made surface. The movie is generous in offering life's numerous little ironies, but these subtle, fragile, thought-provoking aspects are often outweighed by comic situations with &quot;funny&quot; Japanese people. These scenes are laugh-making alright, yet a bit cheap.

I guess it was also supposed to be a bit of a comedy too? I think this will just be one of the movies I either don't get, or I saw the point but it was so small, I expected something bigger. I first saw a big chunck of this movie with a friend and even he was not amused at the movie. I tried to watch it two other times later to give it a try and I could not get through the whole thing. For me at least, I find this movie to be quiet, somewhat symbolic of something, and just stylish. It is stylish in a way that's not flashy, but trendy and artsy. I think it's hard to explain. I thought there was decent acting, but I don't feel that the actors were given much to do really. You do end up seeing a lot of nice scenes and images in Japan which I can appreciate. It is set in modern day Japan and you have Bill Murray and Scarlett J staring as the main actors...they end up forming a friendship (which I thought was going to turn into something more). You also see Anna Faris (Cindy fron Scary Movie) in kind of the same bubbly spirit.I gave this movie 2 stars but I'd like to really give it 2 1/2 because of the picture and color of it and its style. Other than that, I did not like it. If you tend to like movies like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Equilibrium and things like that, you will most likely not like this film.

619247,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B00005JMJ4,Arcadio Bolaos,"[7, 12]","The first minutes of Sofia Coppola's best film to date are quite revealing: A woman, Scarlett Johansson, is in a five star hotel, beholding Tokyo's skyline. A man, Bill Murray, looks through a car's window, curious perhaps, but above all estranged. Combining a deeply poignant music with suggestive images, the director creates a world, a filmic universe that captures our attention immediately. What Sofia Coppola does in the opening frames is what many filmmakers struggle to achieve in their entire careers.Throughout the film there is always a certain feeling of longing, of loneliness; longing for a different tomorrow, and loneliness as the confirmation that the one constant in human condition is discontent. Many critics must have explored the lack of communication as a fundamental key in ""Lost in Translation"", both as the obvious reference of the title and also as an indicator of all that we can't put into language.Perhaps in the best role of his career, Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a washed-out actor that used to be a super star and now has to endorse a Japanese whisky to make a couple of million bucks. He feels like an alien in Tokyo. But he's also a specular image of the Japanese people's own alienated condition. Westernized to the extreme, the Japanese have lost their essence, they are the living example of how further can people go in order to disallow themselves.Giovanni Ribisi's character, a professional photographer also ponders on it: Japanese rock and roll groups that have no substance and exist only thanks to the decoration, the false reality that photography and the right publicity stunt can imprint on them. The photographer is there to sustain the alienation process, even if he disagrees with the falseness of it all.In the same way, Bob Harris has to synthetize in a TV commercial what the Japanese consider the core of Western elegance and sophistication. He is asked to be Roger Moore, Frank Sinatra, he is asked to perform not as the white man he is but as the white man they need him to be. Of course, there can be no words or guidelines for such a taxing acting job. And that's why also it's impossible for the interpreters to translate the instructions given to him. Not only are words lost in translation, but also there is an unnamed need, a `real' that threatens to irrupt into reality, and as Lacan explains in his psychoanalytic theory, the real exceeds the language, the real can never exist within the boundaries of the symbolic, id est, language.Bob Harris is an exhausted man that finds alcohol soothing, although just barely. After 25 years of marriage he is unhappy. Between him and his wife no real communication exists. What takes place, however, is a very insistent simulacrum, much in the same way that everything takes place in Japan. Philosopher Alan Badiou's talks about the importance of the simulacrum in postmodern society (Theory of the Subject); if Sofia Coppola's film is more revealing and enthralling than anything else out there is precisely because it embraces contemporaneity to the maximum; this isn't a film about explanations, about outcomes, which would be a modernist approach; this is a postmodern film in the way that it sates our hunger for art, for beauty and for intellectual value while establishing what Derrida proposed in his deconstruction theory: knowledge can never be complete. When Bob's wife sends him a fax, or Fed-Exes carpet samples, or calls him, it's all a simulacrum. They are never able to connect with each other, not even at the most basic of levels.In the same manner, Charlotte, extraordinarily interpreted by Scarlett Johansson seems to be drifting away. She's married to a successful photographer but she can't figure out what to do with her time. There is no meaning for life, and that thought depresses her and fills her heart with anguish. She tries to get into self-help audiobooks to feel better, to no avail. The entire boom of auto-help material is also an example of Badiou's simulacrum; thousands if not millions of these books are written each year, and yet they are all useless. Life cannot be summarized, standardized and explained so that you can feel better. But despair takes the best of us all, and thus self-help becomes the one and only thing that sells out nowadays.When Charlotte and Bob meet in the hotel's bar, they recognize in the other the same existential doubts, the same sensibilities, and they feel connected. They are the only characters able to actually communicate with each other. Their bond is intensified when contrasted with the world around them, for example, with Charlotte's Japanese friends who are so absolutely alienated and have tried so hard to look and act like Americans that end up as ridiculous and pathetic creatures. Tokyo is a city that denies its past, its traditions, so much that it's simply brutal to see how its inhabitants behave.However, there is still some true beauty left (beauty as it would be understood in the Genji Monogatari (Japanese Literature; Including Selections From Genji Monogatari and Classical Poetry and Drama of Japan) and other traditional Japanese works of art), and Coppola gives us a glimpse of it, in a couple of moments. Nevertheless, this beauty, this true spirit, is constantly covered by the appalling reality that surrounds the protagonists. When Bob Harris receives the visit of a woman wearing sexy stockings, we are privy to yet another example of westernized acculturation and fantasies, although here the fantasy instead of covering the horror of the real merely exacerbates the void, the structural fissures of Japan's society.Sofia Coppola's masterwork resonates deeply inside of us because it's one of the most refined and superb portrayals of the human condition in cinema's history. The final scene, of course, proves once again that there is no such thing as a happy ending, and precisely because of that it reminds us that life is just like that, unpredictable, full of suffering but also possibilities of change and, of course, free will. Lost in Translation makes it into my personal top twenty without a second thought.",5,Lack of Communication & Simulacrum,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,6133,"['first', 'minutes', 'Sofia', 'Coppola',

In one, the waveforms are &quot;in phase&quot; - that is, their peaks occur at the same time and their troughs occur at the same time.  In the other extreme (out of phase), one wave's peak occurs at the same location (or time) as another wave's trough.  The effect of combining the &quot;in phase&quot; waves is addition - the amplitudes of the peaks are added together, thus greater than either one.  This is commonly called &quot;resonance.&quot;  When the equal amplitude out-of-phase waves are added together, they cancel each other out.  This is known as &quot;destructive interference.&quot;I bring this up because this is what happens to viewers of &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot;  If you are in phase with this movie - by personal experiences, then the low-key bemusement will strike a familiar chord.  If you have never had the experience of living out of a hotel - particularly a hotel in a non-English-speaking country, then this movie will probably strike you as extremely dull, and you ought to avoid it.For those of you in the first camp - this movie connects at a fundamental level.  The &quot;hotel lighting&quot;, background music, dimly lit lounges, exotic glimpses of day-to-day life all bring back memories not only of Japan, but of any country or place in which you are the alien.  The amazing thing is that Coppola accomplishes this without making the movie depressing.  While the specifics of the plot certainly weren't personally familiar, the context of the movie makes the plot somewhat irrelevant.Murray &amp; Johansson are most accomplished in their blending in: neither character stands out from the context of the movie.  Both are intrinsic to their settings.  And the effect of this is to make the separation of the two that much more affecting.A marvelous, understated and powerful movie.

619253,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,B00005JMJ4,Barry C. Chow,"[11, 16]","This cinematic treat from Sofia Coppola is an art house film in the best sense of that tradition, and is so clearly not for everyone that I just don't understand why the Terminator crowd even bother with it. The negative reviews variously citing its slow pace, meandering storyline, open-ended structure and lack of conventional resolution are all spot on. But these are the film's very strengths, and the furthest things from weaknesses.This film is about imperfectly real people, and portrays them with a depth and authenticity that Hollywood rarely strives for, much less achieves. It doesn't pander to hoary conventions or cheap passions, and its deliberate pacing and loose structure are actually products of the director's faith in the intelligence of her audience. She is counting on us to be both receptive and contemplative--sensitive enough to pick up on nuance and understatement without explicit narrative and broadcasted emotive cues. Based on the negative reviews on this site, it's too bad that her faith is misplaced in so many.Art house films may test our maturity, but too often do so by stepping over into bombast and pretension. Consider ""My Dinner With Andre"", or ""Leaving Las Vegas"". In this film Coppola succeeds in coupling maturity with humility: she shows but doesn't tell; she teaches but doesn't preach; she has so much respect for our intelligence that she leaves blanks throughout the film and invites us to fill them in. However, this strands those incapable of or disinclined to filling in such blanks.This film examines the undercurrents of life. It recognises that the truly vexing parts of life are not the Big Questions, and therefore doesn't proffer Big Answers. If you are looking for soap opera drama, you won't find it here. Likewise, if you are looking for a follow-the-bouncing-dot story, you had best stick with Titanic. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of blank verse poetry: it uses loose structure, unusual rhythms and absence of rhyme to evoke life's discontinuities. Its themes are subterranean and not at all open to mechanical analysis.The search for meaning in life is invariably difficult and frustrating. We devote much energy to tracking down false leads and dead ends before slowly plotting out the few roads that lead to worthy destinations. This film respects that process by mirroring the journey of its characters in like terms. For example, much of their time is spent staring out windows. For the music video crowd, this is just dead air; but, for thoughtful people, such moments are pauses for reflection. Every time one of the characters pause, we pause, and consider aspects of their existence--hoping that they will arrive at conclusions that will take them one step closer to untangling their lives. It takes a special film to make a viewer so sympathetic to the characters that we step into their skins, and Lost in Translation delivers with a sincerity that is rare and heartfelt.I would not dream of recommending this film to everyone. Those who need the comfort of formula, the clarity of spoon-fed exposition, and the reassurance of convention will get absolutely nothing out of this film and should just skip it. Here's a simple test: if you feel that, for a movie to be complete, the boy must either get the girl or sacrifice himself in compliance to some tired heroic clich&eacute;, then don't bother with this film. You won't like it. But if you can handle uncertainty, meandering structure and understated nuance, then give this film a try. Among mass entertainment that assumes its spectators to be morons, this film's quiet eloquence and regard for its audience is as air to a drowning man.",5,Lost to Small Minds,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,3674,"['cinematic', 'treat', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'best', 'sense', 'tradition', 'so', 'clearly', 'not', 'everyone', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Terminator', 'crowd', 'even', 'bother', 'negative', 'reviews', 'variously', 'citing', 'slow', 'pace', 'meandering', 'storyline', 'open-ended', 'structure', 'lack', 'conventional', 'resolution', 'are', 'spot', 'are', 'film', 'very', 'strengths', 'furthest', 'things', 'weaknesses.This', 'film', 'about', 'imperfectly', 'real', 'people', 'depth', 'authenticity', 'Hollywood', 'rarely', 'much', 'less', 'achieves', ""n't"", 'pander', 'hoary', 'conventions', 'cheap', 'passions', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'loose', 'structure', 'are', 'actually', 'products', 'director', 'faith', 'intelligence', 'audience', 'counting', 'be', 'receptive', 'contemplative', 'sensitive', 'enough', 'pick', 'up', 'nuance', 'understatement', 'explicit', 'narrative', 'broadcasted', 'emotive', 'cues', 'Based', 'negative', 'reviews', 'site', 'too', 'bad', 'faith', 'misplaced', 'so', 'many.Art', 'house', 'films', 'may', 'test', 'maturity', 'too', 'often', 'do', 'so', 'stepping', 'over', 'bombast', 'pretension', 'Consider', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'film', 'Coppola', 'coupling', 'maturity', 'humility', ""n't"", 'tell', ""n't"", 'preach', 'so', 'much', 'respect', 'intelligence', 'blanks', 'film', 'fill', 'However', 'incapable', 'disinclined', 'filling', 'such', 'blanks.This', 'film', 'undercurrents', 'life', 'truly', 'vexing', 'parts', 'life', 'are', 'not', 'Big', 'Questions', 'therefore', ""n't"", 'proffer', 'Big', 'Answers', 'are', 'looking', 'soap', 'opera', 'drama', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'Likewise', 'are', 'looking', 'follow-the-bouncing-dot', 'story', 'had', 'best', 'stick', 'Titanic', 'movie', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'blank', 'verse', 'poetry', 'loose', 'structure', 'unusual', 'rhythms', 'absence', 'rhyme', 'evoke', 'life', 'discontinuities', 'themes', 'are', 'subterranean', 'not', 'open', 'mechanical', 'analysis.The', 'search', 'meaning', 'life', 'invariably', 'difficult', 'frustrating', 'devote', 'much', 'energy', 'tracking', 'down', 'false', 'leads', 'dead', 'ends', 'slowly', 'plotting', 'out', 'few', 'roads', 'lead', 'worthy', 'destinations', 'film', 'process', 'mirroring', 'journey', 'characters', 'terms', 'example', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'staring', 'out', 'windows', 'music', 'video', 'crowd', 'just', 'dead', 'air', 'thoughtful', 'people', 'such', 'moments', 'are', 'pauses', 'reflection', 'time', 'one', 'characters', 'pause', 'pause', 'consider', 'aspects', 'existence', 'hoping', 'will', 'arrive', 'conclusions', 'will', 'take', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'untangling', 'lives', 'special', 'film', 'make', 'viewer', 'so', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'step', 'skins', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'delivers', 'sincerity', 'rare', 'heartfelt.I', 'would', 'not', 'dream', 'recommending', 'film', 'everyone', 'who', 'need', 'comfort', 'formula', 'clarity', 'spoon-fed', 'exposition', 'reassurance', 'convention', 'will', 'get', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'should', 'just', 'skip', 'Here', 'simple', 'test', 'feel', 'movie', 'be', 'complete', 'boy', 'must', 'either', 'get', 'girl', 'sacrifice', 'compliance', 'tired', 'heroic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'can', 'handle', 'uncertainty', 'meandering', 'structure', 'understated', 'nuance', 'then', 'give', 'film', 'try', 'mass', 'entertainment', 'spectators', 'be', 'morons', 'film', 'quiet', 'eloquence', 'regard', 'audience', 'as', 'air', 'drowning', 'man']",Lost in Translation

However, unless you've been under a rock you've heard all the hype: Oscar nods for leads Scarlett Johansson & Bill Murray, and Writer/Director Sofia Coppola (who won the Oscar for best original screenplay). Thus overwhelmed or at least tainted by the hype you'll likely say to yourself or anyone else in the room at the end of this film: ""What the? That movie sucked!""The Good: Scarlett Johansson & Bill Murray are fun to watch together. It's almost like watching the real Murray try to amuse himself in Tokyo. Coppola really does a good job handling the real star of the film: TOKYO! This film couldn't, wouldn't exist in any other setting. Murray & Johansson partake in a feww experiences truly unique to Tokyo and Coppola, who is on record as having spent A LOT of time there, captures it beautifully. From the crowded trains, to the Shibuya shopping, to the small restaurants & karaoke bars--Coppola gives Tokyo a feel of wonderment and warmth while maintaining the uneasiness any Westerner feels when they first visit Tokyo.The Bad: This is not a Hollywood love story. No answered questions or traditional characters. I liked this about the film, but a lot of people I talked to found this to be too much for them. Yes the pace is slow, and I feel there should've been a bit more comedy with Murray and his fish out of water experiences with Japanese culture. Another thing is Coppola missed so much stuff about Tokyo and Japan! Having lived in Tokyo myself, I felt she only hit the tip of the iceberg. Most of this was because her main characters were rich and pampered entertainment types (something Coppola undoubtedly related to) so they missed out on a lot of ""normal"" Tokyo experiences that occur outside the 5 star hotel circle..The DVD: Great behind the scenes footage from Coppola's then husband, Spike Jonze. All too brief ""interview"" w/ Murray & Coppola. Sadly no commentary from ANYONE! I'd love to hear some of Coppola's real life stories from her time in Tokyo as well as any similar experiences Murray & Johansson might've had in Japan with their characters. No deleted scenes. No outtakes.Bottomline: If you don't buy into the hype and watch the film with an open mind you won't be dissapointed.",4,"Overhyped, but still enchanting",1080864000,"04 2, 2004",2004,2413,"['were', 'just', 'happen', 'movie', 'DVD', 'rental', 'shop', 'pick', 'up', 'little', 'blurb', 'back', 'intrigued', 'then', 'end', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'pleasently', 'surprised', 'However', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rock', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'hype', 'Oscar', 'nods', 'leads', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Writer/Director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Thus', 'overwhelmed', 'least', 'tainted', 'hype', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'say', 'anyone', 'else', 'room', 'end', 'film', 'What', 'movie', 'sucked', 'Good', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'together', 'almost', 'watching', 'real', 'Murray', 'try', 'amuse', 'Tokyo', 'Coppola', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'handling', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'TOKYO', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'exist', 'other', 'setting', 'Murray', 'Johansson', 'partake', 'feww', 'experiences', 'truly', 'unique', 'Tokyo', 'Coppola', 'who', 'record', 'having', 'spent', 'A', 'LOT', 'time', 'beautifully', 'crowded', 'trains', 'Shibuya', 'shopping', 'small', 'restaurants', 'karaoke', 'bars', 'Coppola', 'Tokyo', 'feel', 'wonderment', 'warmth', 'maintaining', 'uneasiness', 'Westerner', 'feels', 'when', 'first', 'visit', 'Tokyo.The', 'Bad', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'love', 'story', 'answered', 'questions', 'traditional', 'characters', 'liked', 'film', 'lot', 'people', 'talked', 'found', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'Yes', 'pace', 'slow', 'feel', 'there', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'comedy', 'Murray', 'fish', 'water', 'experiences', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'thing', 'Coppola', 'missed', 'so', 'much', 'stuff', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Having', 'lived', 'Tokyo', 'felt', 'only', 'hit', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'Most', 'was', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'rich', 'pampered', 'entertainment', 'types', 'something', 'Coppola', 'undoubtedly', 'related', 'missed', 'out', 'lot', 'normal', 'Tokyo', 'occur', '5', 'star', 'hotel', 'circle..The', 'DVD', 'Great', 'scenes', 'footage', 'Coppola', 'then', 'husband', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'All', 'too', 'brief', 'interview', 'w/', 'Murray', 'Coppola', 'Sadly', 'commentary', 'ANYONE', ""'d"", 'love', 'hear', 'Coppola', 'real', 'life', 'stories', 'time', 'Tokyo', 'as', 'well', 'similar', 'experiences', 'Murray', 'Johansson', 'might', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Japan', 'characters', 'No', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes.Bottomline', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'hype', 'watch', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed']",Lost in Translation
619256,A7OJISP7BPIGB,B00005JMJ4,"Benjamin B. Eshbach ""Ben Eshbach""","[26, 106]","This is a story told from the point of view of a shockingly self-obsessed girl who finds her poor li'l ol' self stranded in Tokyo Japan. Her hatred for women is shown to us (through her first-person eyes) as a parade of moderately retarded bimbos and an occasional prostitute, punctuated by a sweetheart of a man who is, of course, the victim of yet another bitchy woman. Even this sweetheart (played by Bill Murray) is portrayed as virtuous in precisely only those instances where his interests intersect with the interests of our neglected Princess.Our poor protagonist has a husband who, like the other women in the movie, is written to be stupid, cardboard, insensitive and prone to inexplicable fits of protracted misunderstanding. Our Princess is also written to have a degree in philosophy and a penchant for knitting - both tokens of *depth* as prop-ish as the hotel wallpaper only more contrived and not as pretty. The racist elements of the movie are shown against the backdrop of a hip soundtrack. The soundtrack wins, giving the audience the moral permission to laugh without feeling boorish.Long, tedious shots of the winsome girl staring out her hotel window at the sprawling city - which to her is merely a mosaic painted on the window of her hotel/prison - mean to give us a sense of her emotional despair. The cure, Gobs of Attention, is disguised in more palatable forms for ticketholders. Even a trip to the Buddhist temple doesn't move her. Hadn't anyone warned her that monks don't fawn? But the requisite Gobs of Attention eventually come from Murray and this almost makes Princess happy.Of course this dismal story is told from the perspective of the dismal Princess - consequently, the retarded bimbo, cardboard boyfriend, me-so-hoe-nee prostitute, bucktoothed Japanese folk and all the rest of her projections are submitted as ""givens"" in the screenplay. Her self-obsession is absent from her self-awareness and is therefore absent from the surface of the script, and so forth. What we get is a view of the world from ""behind the eyes"" of a Spoiled Snot who doesn't realize that's what she's letting us see. The view? Pretty damned lonely. We're supposed to blame this on her various projections. Some moviegoers actually do. They're the ones who click ""NO"" on Was-This-Review-Helpful?By the time Princess receives her panacea, the audience has been bludgeoned into submission and says ""Thank you sir"" for a spoonful of some mighty thin gruel. Tears and cheers are finally milked from the teenage girls. Then the credits roll.Bill Murray is outstanding, nonetheless.Ms. Copolla uses this movie to show us how she would like us to see her - which is different from how she sees herself - which is also different from how she actually IS.",2,Super scary look into the head of a Princess.,1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,2761,"['story', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'shockingly', 'self-obsessed', 'girl', 'who', 'poor', 'li', 'l', 'ol', 'self', 'stranded', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'hatred', 'women', 'shown', 'first-person', 'eyes', 'parade', 'moderately', 'retarded', 'bimbos', 'occasional', 'prostitute', 'punctuated', 'sweetheart', 'man', 'who', 'course', 'victim', 'yet', 'bitchy', 'woman', 'Even', 'sweetheart', 'played', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'portrayed', 'virtuous', 'precisely', 'only', 'instances', 'where', 'interests', 'intersect', 'interests', 'neglected', 'Princess.Our', 'poor', 'protagonist', 'husband', 'who', 'other', 'women', 'movie', 'written', 'be', 'stupid', 'cardboard', 'insensitive', 'prone', 'inexplicable', 'fits', 'protracted', 'misunderstanding', 'Princess', 'also', 'written', 'have', 'degree', 'philosophy', 'penchant', 'knitting', 'tokens', '*depth*', 'as', 'prop-ish', 'hotel', 'only', 'more', 'contrived', 'not', 'pretty', 'racist', 'elements', 'movie', 'are', 'shown', 'backdrop', 'hip', 'soundtrack', 'soundtrack', 'giving', 'audience', 'moral', 'permission', 'laugh', 'feeling', 'boorish.Long', 'tedious', 'shots', 'winsome', 'girl', 'staring', 'out', 'hotel', 'window', 'sprawling', 'city', 'merely', 'mosaic', 'painted', 'window', 'hotel/prison', 'mean', 'give', 'sense', 'emotional', 'despair', 'cure', 'Gobs', 'Attention', 'disguised', 'more', 'palatable', 'forms', 'ticketholders', 'Even', 'trip', 'Buddhist', 'temple', ""n't"", 'move', 'Had', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'warned', 'monks', 'do', ""n't"", 'fawn', 'requisite', 'Gobs', 'Attention', 'eventually', 'come', 'Murray', 'almost', 'Princess', 'happy.Of', 'course', 'dismal', 'story', 'told', 'perspective', 'dismal', 'Princess', 'consequently', 'retarded', 'bimbo', 'cardboard', 'boyfriend', 'me-so-hoe-nee', 'prostitute', 'bucktoothed', 'Japanese', 'folk', 'rest', 'projections', 'are', 'submitted', 'givens', 'screenplay', 'self-obsession', 'absent', 'self-awareness', 'therefore', 'absent', 'surface', 'script', 'so', 'forth', 'What', 'get', 'view', 'world', 'eyes', 'Spoiled', 'Snot', 'who', ""n't"", 'realize', 'what', 'letting', 'see', 'view', 'Pretty', 'damned', 'lonely', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'blame', 'various', 'projections', 'moviegoers', 'actually', 'do', ""'re"", 'ones', 'who', 'click', 'NO', 'Was-This-Review-Helpful', 'time', 'Princess', 'panacea', 'audience', 'been', 'bludgeoned', 'submission', 'Thank', 'sir', 'spoonful', 'mighty', 'thin', 'gruel', 'Tears', 'cheers', 'are', 'finally', 'milked', 'teenage', 'girls', 'Then', 'credits', 'roll.Bill', 'Murray', 'outstanding', 'nonetheless.Ms', 'Copolla', 'movie', 'show', 'how', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'different', 'how', 'also', 'different', 'how', 'actually', 'IS']",Lost in Translation

I mean, you go up to this person who looks troubled or smart or wise or fun, even though you don't know them. And for some reason, you're able to talk with this stranger. You talk about things that matter. You know where they are, what they're dealing with. And they talk to you like they know what you're going through and where you're going with it.Maybe you were on vacation somewhere. Maybe it was a wrong number on a phone call. Maybe, just maybe, it was fate, giving you a hand and a person to lean on when you didn't quite know you needed it.Now, you and this stranger share a couple enchanted moments, where it seems like someone who doesn't know you is the only one who can hear you. And when the talk ends or the enchanted time with this stranger passes, you're somehow the better for it, even though nothing particularly substantial happened.Fate reminds you that you're not alone, and fate reminds you of the sort of wonderful person you really are, outside of all the day-to-day drama of your life or away from the minutae that surrounds your everyday existence.In Sofia Coppolla's LOST IN TRANSLATION, two strangers, Bob and Charlotte, share that kind of connection when they both end up in a Tokyo hotel, where they don't fit in with the world around them and don't seem to belong anywhere. So they come together.What they share is not quite a romantic love, but it is a romance. Their friendship provides them with solace, with enchanted moments. Their chats give them both the strength and the tools to deal with their real lives. They're strangers to one another, who may only know each other a week, but they understand each other at a time when both of them needed to be seen for who they were and understood.Bob's an actor in Tokyo doing a commercial and taking a break from his exasperated wife. Charlotte's accompanying her photographer husband on a business trip - even though he leaves her alone for most of the time - because she didn't have anything better to do back home. She's in the process of discovering her identity. He's in the process of rediscovering who he is in the midst of the life he's grown tired of leading.And they help each other.This film is completely charming and very mature, having its characters understand and explore some fundamental aspects of human nature and identity. The film is also very funny, exploring a clash of cultures and examining the weirdness of how you can sometimes get to the heart of who you are when you're away from everything you're familiar with.The acting, particularly from the leads, is excellent. Scarlett Johansson's character is so fully realized that you want to hug her, and Bill Murray gives the best performance of his career. The film is beautiful to look at. The story's wonderful and smart, and the script is amusing yet serious.LOST IN TRANSLATION helps you feel better about yourself.

619258,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B00005JMJ4,Ben Rowland,"[4, 5]","There are some movies where the story, background, and other important devices are totally superfluous, and the only focal point is the characters. ""Lost in Translation"" is just such a movie. It would probably have worked just as well as a stage play, considering that the movie is basically about two characters. While the praise and Oscar nods may have raised my expectations, I found this movie to be average and insubstantial, but with good performances that elevate it from the status of a fluff piece.Bill Murray plays perhaps his best performance as Bob Harris, a middle-aged actor who has past his prime, no longer happy in his marriage, and doing a whisky advertisement in Tokyo. Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, a recent university graduate who is at a loss for what to do with her life, and has come to Tokyo with her husband, a celebrity photographer, hoping that the change of scenery will spark something within her. Of course, it doesn't. Both are in similar states of drudgery, and in Japan, a culture so far removed from their own, their unhappiness takes centre stage. Predictably, the two hit it off and find life in each other, even though it is known from the start that nothing can happen between the two of them. They are both married (albeit unhappily), and one is old enough to be the other's father. They story is very simple, how two people in a strange environment can find each other. I didn't walk away from this movie feeling uplifted or saddened, which was disappointing considering all the critical hoopla surrounding it.Bill Murray is the main attraction here, taking a lead from other comedic actors who are making a switch to more dramatic roles in their autumn years. He is really good here, playing a more subdued role, while still maintaining a dry sense of humor. Scarlett Johansson is also good in her respective role, though her performance is hardly Oscar material. Aside from the two performances, there is very little to this movie to recommend. The script by Sofia Coppola is well devised, but in a year with so many other great movies, I find it hard to accept that this was the best screenplay. On a sad note, the humor in ""Lost in Translation"" does not come from the actors or the script, but from mocking Japanese people and customs. I was not offended, but found it sad that this was the singular source of comic relief in a movie that was supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread.The DVD package is pretty light on the extras, but what it provided is pretty good. The interview with Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray is well done, and you get an appreciation for the passion they put into this movie. The ""Lost in Location"" documentary is nice, but nothing overly interesting occurs. It is a run of the mill behind the scenes piece. Fans expecting something more extensive might be disappointed, since there is no commentary or any other substantial featurettes. I think this was released to cash in on the Oscar hype, so a special edition is likely in the near future.""Lost in Translation"" works are a decent character drama, but not a great one. I guess it said more to some than others, but I expected a lot more from this movie.

It is not a manipulative film; rather, the camera will sit in on a scene and let you eavesdrop on these people when they are alone or with others.  The film asks you to become invested enough to pay attention to everything, from facial expressions, to character psychology, to the kaleidiscope of scenes and situations, to the symbolism of the dialogue.  This is a very SUBTLE film, and requires the utmost attention and respect when viewing.  BUT-if you can give it that respect and investment, you will walk away completely rewarded and satisfied, as this is true movie making of the highest order.  The emotions, the colors, the cinematography, the moody music, the ebb and flow vibe of the film itself.  And finally, the comedy: yes, there is comedy, and it is funny, but please be forewarned that it takes a second seat to the characters and the atmosphere.  All of this mixed together with the FANTASTIC acting of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson (watch her facial expressions at all times), and you have a film that is more an experience than a movie.  Just remember: although this film is incredible, it cannot be watched in every situation.  You will most likely not enjoy the movie if (a) you invite a bunch of friends over to drink and watch a funny film, or (b)you throw it in the player because there's nothing else to do and only half pay attention to it.  The ideal way to view a film as subtle and atmospheric as this is to watch it with someone you care about or with people whom you know are patient enough to make the investment.  Make sure there are no distractions around, sit back, dim the lights, and watch this film with unexpecting eyes.NOTE: DVD extras are okay; watch &quot;Lost on Location&quot; which is simply a home video of the day-by-day shooting and shows Bill Murray being Bill Murray behind the scenes-which is a really good thing.",5,AMAZING MOVIE--not a &quot;comedy&quot;,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,2368,"['film', 'been', 'somewhat', 'misadvertised', 'order', 'get', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'theatre', 'movie', 'stores', 'many', 'ads', 'try', 'stamp', 'movie', 'quot', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Comedy.', 'quot', 'rent', 'buy', 'DVD', 'intention', 'viewing', 'quot', 'What', 'Bob', 'Japan', 'quot', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'dramatic', 'realistic', 'take', 'loneliness', 'brief', 'yet', 'powerful', 'connections', 'can', 'make', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'lives', 'not', 'manipulative', 'film', 'rather', 'camera', 'will', 'sit', 'scene', 'let', 'eavesdrop', 'people', 'when', 'are', 'alone', 'others', 'film', 'become', 'invested', 'enough', 'pay', 'attention', 'everything', 'facial', 'expressions', 'character', 'psychology', 'kaleidiscope', 'scenes', 'situations', 'symbolism', 'dialogue', 'very', 'SUBTLE', 'film', 'utmost', 'attention', 'respect', 'when', 'viewing', 'BUT-if', 'can', 'give', 'respect', 'investment', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'completely', 'rewarded', 'satisfied', 'true', 'movie', 'making', 'highest', 'order', 'emotions', 'colors', 'cinematography', 'moody', 'music', 'ebb', 'flow', 'vibe', 'film', 'finally', 'comedy', 'yes', 'comedy', 'funny', 'please', 'be', 'forewarned', 'second', 'seat', 'characters', 'atmosphere', 'mixed', 'together', 'FANTASTIC', 'acting', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johanson', 'watch', 'facial', 'expressions', 'times', 'have', 'film', 'more', 'experience', 'movie', 'Just', 'remember', 'film', 'incredible', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'watched', 'situation', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'invite', 'bunch', 'friends', 'drink', 'watch', 'funny', 'film', 'b', 'throw', 'player', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'only', 'half', 'pay', 'attention', 'ideal', 'way', 'view', 'film', 'subtle', 'atmospheric', 'watch', 'someone', 'care', 'people', 'whom', 'know', 'are', 'patient', 'enough', 'make', 'investment', 'Make', 'sure', 'are', 'distractions', 'sit', 'back', 'lights', 'watch', 'film', 'unexpecting', 'eyes.NOTE', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'okay', 'watch', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Location', 'quot', 'simply', 'home', 'video', 'day-by-day', 'shooting', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'being', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'scenes-which', 'really', 'good', 'thing']",Lost in Translation

I thought with an original title like 'Lost in Translation, a talented cast headed by Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and Giovanni Ribisi and a Coppola directing it, what could go wrong? Well in my view, from the moment that the film's dialogue started, it just went awry.'Lost in Translation' centers around 2 neglected Americans who become drawn to each other because of their mutual loneliness and their need to find themselves. Bill Murray plays a has-been actor who feels more loved in Japan than in his native land. He sees Johansson often in their hotel, she plays an educated, young and married woman who feels neglected by her husband, a photographer (Giovanni Ribisi). These 2 characters become attracted to each other on a strictly platonic level at first but one begins to question that as the film continues. So far, so good, right? Wrong.My main qualm about this film that makes me give it 2 stars is the fact that this film is blatantly patronising to the Japanese: the constant, patronising and derisive comments uttered by Bill Murray made me think - Has Hollywood come to this? Do you need to make fun of people's accents and culture to gain an Oscar nod and laughs from expatriates?Even without the condescending remarks to the Japanese, the pace of the film is slow and worn out. You want to find out whether the 2 characters do have any genuine feelings for each other or whether it is platonic, but the film does not offer a platform for their feelings or their appreciation for each other to develop.Last Thoughts: Why did Johansson and Murray agree to do this film?",2,Lost in Disappointment...,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,1646,"['Shelley', 'Fyfe', 'felt', 'robbed', 'when', 'left', 'cinema', 'thought', 'original', 'title', ""'Lost"", 'Translation', 'talented', 'cast', 'headed', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Coppola', 'directing', 'what', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'Well', 'view', 'moment', 'film', 'dialogue', 'started', 'just', 'went', 'awry', ""'Lost"", 'Translation', 'centers', '2', 'neglected', 'Americans', 'who', 'become', 'drawn', 'other', 'mutual', 'loneliness', 'need', 'find', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'has-been', 'actor', 'who', 'more', 'loved', 'Japan', 'native', 'land', 'Johansson', 'often', 'hotel', 'educated', 'young', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'neglected', 'husband', 'photographer', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', '2', 'characters', 'become', 'attracted', 'other', 'strictly', 'platonic', 'level', 'first', 'one', 'question', 'film', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'right', 'Wrong.My', 'main', 'qualm', 'film', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'fact', 'film', 'blatantly', 'patronising', 'Japanese', 'constant', 'patronising', 'derisive', 'comments', 'uttered', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'made', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'come', 'Do', 'need', 'make', 'fun', 'people', 'accents', 'culture', 'gain', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'expatriates', 'Even', 'condescending', 'remarks', 'Japanese', 'pace', 'film', 'slow', 'worn', 'out', 'want', 'find', 'out', '2', 'characters', 'do', 'have', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'other', 'platonic', 'film', 'not', 'offer', 'platform', 'feelings', 'appreciation', 'other', 'develop.Last', 'Thoughts', 'Why', 'did', 'Johansson', 'Murray', 'agree', 'do', 'film']",Lost in Translation

Everyone is too busy and there's nothing really wrong, nothing one can talk about.  They feel they have lost touch not only with their loved ones, but also with the world in general.  Ms. Coppola knows what she is doing and executes her theme well.  Tokyo, because it is such a fast-paced, confusing, foreign place, is the perfect spiritual location for these two lost people who somehow manage to connect.  It is not through action or words; they never do anything momentous and only occasionally say anything out of the ordinary.  Connection is a miracle; trying to analyze or explain it would ruin it.

Essentially that is the plot of Lost in Translation and if you've ever had that kind of experience more than likely you will come away touched by this beautifully moving, emotionally touching film.If you like your films plot driven instead of character driven, then this film isn't for you. There's isn't much else to tell about Lost. Two lonely hearts, alienated by their personal lives and befuddled by Tokyo's cultural and communicational differences, reach out to each other, bond on many different levels while exploring Tokyo and learn more about who they are along the way.  When the final frame concluded, I found myself sobbing in my chair.  I have been fortunate enough to have a similar experience (although not in Tokyo) and was incredibly touched by Lost in Translation.Murray is fantastic and subtle, Johansson is a breath of fresh air, Coppola's direction and cinematography is superb and the soundtrack is flawless.  Although definitely Oscar worthy on all counts, I think the media hype hurt rather than helped the film.  Some people who saw this based on the hype came away disappointed and frustrated (see any of the one or two starred reviews below).  See this film ONLY if you meant to see it before it got all the media recognition.In closing, I don't think Coppola was trying to be artsy or trying to send a message.  I think she was honestly trying to show two lonely people connecting with each other on a personal face-to-face level.

619267,A3DM08AHYJHS0P,B00005JMJ4,"""boxingelena2000""","[0, 3]","The first thing that struck me about 'Lost in Translation' was the fact that the whole film focuses on 'THE moment', and at that, it is startingly thought-provoking. The moment of intercultural interaction struggle, when you don't know whether to feel amused, upset or uncomfortable. The moment of utter alienation, when, explosively, you get away from everyday problems and get immersed into the unknown. The moment of reflection. The moment of reciprocal appreciation between two beings.Two despondent Americans are passing time in Japan - the middle-aged man (Murray) is working on an international photo-shoot, and the young woman (Johansson)is married to an erratic photographer and is deciding what she wants from her life. They meet one night at the bar, and talk, about nothing, yet what immediately unites them is a mutual strive for self-fulfillment, the lack of which is accentuated in a faraway city filled with so many unique traditions. Intoxicated by the radical diversity, and spellbound by each other's company, the two characters go through a revelatory redemption.Simplicity is the key in this contemplative motion picture, wrongly advertised as a comedy (neither is it a 'modern day Lolita). 'Lost in Translation' does have its share of hilarity, most apparent in scenes of Bill Murray trying to communicate with the various directors, talk show hosts and karaoke singers. While slightly astounded by the militant ethnic disparity, Bill Murray is never offensive in his reactions to frankly eccentric individuals - he is flabbergasted by it. In truth, the film is about its two protagonists, suspended in vacuum, face-to-face with disaffection. As genuine as Copolla's sensible, minimalist approach is, their attraction cannot be described as sexual- it's candidly longing, and hence the age difference is neglected.  There is little dialogue, little action, little plot - but we confront and go along with the movie, because it efficiently discovers a tone that swathes us.Believe the hype - you will fall in love with the marvelous Murray, gorgeous Johannson and candor of this simple yet tremendously heartwarming, truly magical film.",4,Subliminally Effective,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,2157,"['first', 'thing', 'struck', ""'Lost"", 'Translation', 'was', 'fact', 'whole', 'film', 'focuses', 'moment', 'startingly', 'thought-provoking', 'moment', 'intercultural', 'interaction', 'struggle', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'feel', 'amused', 'upset', 'uncomfortable', 'moment', 'utter', 'alienation', 'when', 'explosively', 'get', 'away', 'everyday', 'problems', 'get', 'immersed', 'unknown', 'moment', 'reflection', 'moment', 'reciprocal', 'appreciation', 'two', 'beings.Two', 'despondent', 'Americans', 'are', 'passing', 'time', 'Japan', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'Murray', 'working', 'international', 'photo-shoot', 'young', 'woman', 'Johansson', 'married', 'erratic', 'photographer', 'deciding', 'what', 'life', 'meet', 'one', 'night', 'bar', 'talk', 'nothing', 'what', 'immediately', 'mutual', 'strive', 'self-fulfillment', 'lack', 'accentuated', 'faraway', 'city', 'filled', 'so', 'many', 'unique', 'traditions', 'Intoxicated', 'radical', 'diversity', 'spellbound', 'other', 'company', 'two', 'characters', 'go', 'revelatory', 'redemption.Simplicity', 'key', 'contemplative', 'motion', 'picture', 'wrongly', 'advertised', 'comedy', ""'modern"", 'day', 'Lolita', ""'Lost"", 'Translation', 'have', 'share', 'hilarity', 'most', 'apparent', 'scenes', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'trying', 'communicate', 'various', 'directors', 'talk', 'show', 'hosts', 'karaoke', 'singers', 'slightly', 'astounded', 'militant', 'ethnic', 'disparity', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'never', 'offensive', 'reactions', 'frankly', 'eccentric', 'individuals', 'flabbergasted', 'truth', 'film', 'two', 'protagonists', 'suspended', 'vacuum', 'face-to-face', 'disaffection', 'As', 'genuine', 'Copolla', 'sensible', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'attraction', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'described', 'sexual-', 'candidly', 'longing', 'hence', 'age', 'difference', 'neglected', 'little', 'dialogue', 'little', 'action', 'little', 'plot', 'confront', 'go', 'along', 'movie', 'efficiently', 'tone', 'us.Believe', 'hype', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'marvelous', 'Murray', 'gorgeous', 'Johannson', 'candor', 'simple', 'yet', 'tremendously', 'heartwarming', 'truly', 'magical', 'film']",Lost in Translation

619269,A88IZVHRTA0BV,B00005JMJ4,Brandon DiSabatino,"[1, 4]","As one might reasonably surmise, due to the excessively positive reception of this film (in terms of aesthetic cinematography and acumen of craft) I was somewhat piqued to see it for myself.  After all the extortionate lengths that some critics have endeavored to pursue in adulation of this movie (in particular Bill Murray's performance and Sofia Coppola's script and direction), try and imagine the diminutive fraction of possibility that this film might actually have a reputation that precedes it.  Come on, Ebert readily assessed it as a work of sheer brilliance, Siskel's foreskin foreheaded doppleganger Roepert opined likewise, and every other person who ever witnessed it regaled its power to be tantamount to the second coming.  In what absurd, deranged, and forlorn alternate dimension could the facts possibly divagate from the hype?  Well keep your cosmonaut shoes on, because you need jaunt no further than your local multiplex or video store to see how incredibly fallible the majority of critics truly are.  Now, what is wrong with the picture?One of the unfortunate misgivings about this movie is the fact that the trailer and all its satellite previews made it appear like some kind of standard Murray comedy.  We are given brief glimpses into the more garrulous scenes in the picture, all of which if properly taken out of context and arbitrarily collocated into a filmic presentation would approximately last no more than 45 seconds (hmm, the usual running time for tv spots that advertise these films).  But I can willingly forgive a fallacious trailer as long as I am supplied with some modicum of entertainment.  Not since Gigli have I suffered the kind of cine-masochistic audacity that is prevalent in Lost in Translation.  I can at least commend Gigli on the fact that it made ample use of its running time by appropriating a little something called dialogue (albeit a banal, deliriously unfunny discourse), whereas Lost in Translation decides to express itself in the form of epigrams.  We are given a random collection of words that are so disassociated with human emotions - lines that are empty, callous, frigid, and insipid - that I have heard more convincing dramatic delivery from C-3P0 and his four inch tall life partner R-2D2.  Simply put, no one in this movie knows what sentimentality is, nor would they recognize it if it lodged itself in their urine canal.  But hold your trendy tongues you art house phonies, to any of you who would so naively conclude that I am not familiar with pictures that fail to utilize the standard pentameter of Hollywood banter, for that is far from the case.  2001: Space Odyssey and Eraserhead are both films that confidently employ succinctness in lieu of loquacious rambling.  Yet those two films differ from Coppola's film in the one major way : they actually supplant their silence with a redeemable artistic aspect.  But the script (or lack thereof) is only one of the baneful obstacles this turgid priapus cannot competently penetrate.Let me address the area of performance from our two main actors, Bill Murray and Scarlet Johannson.  Scarlet's character is supposed to be a jaded philosophy major.  The staggering problem of this is the fact that she barely attempts to open her mouth and say something intelligent.  I do not particularly care if Sofia Coppola was trying induce a full-blown aneurysm from those people who watch her movie and recognize the aberrant timidity of her lead heroine, nor do I care if she was trying to suggest the vernal obfuscation of the character who merely studied philosophy on a whim but now finds herself abruptly distanced from the world - such trite characterization that clumsily fuddles with assumptive subtext wretchedly turns a viscid knife in my stomach - because quite honestly, her character made me feel absolutely nothing.  I no doubt theorize that I would receive warmer reciprocity from the rubber inguinal notches of a blow-up doll.  But what is most offensive to me as a moviegoer is the superfluous praise of Murray's ""outstanding"" performance.  If someone would kindly delineate to me the fundamental differences of Murray's character here and his portrayal in other movies, I would most humbly appreciate it.  The fact is this:  Bill Murray plays Bill Murray playing Bill Murray in this movie.  He assumes the role he has assumed in every single movie he's ever been in (save for Caddyshack).  The dry wit, the partial smile, the frequently bumptious lifts of the eyebrows to punctuate the irony of a situation - check, check, check, everything seems to be in order.  And though I do appreciate Murray as a comedian, I do not think it befitting to flank him with vociferous hosannas and felicitations simply because his character appeared flaccid for an entire hour and forty two minutes on screen.So we now set our sights on Coppola as a director.  Given the size of her father (in terms of work and mountainous girth) it is indeed foreseeable that she will be subjected to nepotistic juxtaposition.  But as most of you recall, it was the young voluptuary herself who single-handedly turned the Godfather III from lesser-sequel to garish and straight-to-video histrionic horse manure.  Not apparently content with assassinating the repute of her father's career (after the bloated anti-climax of the last in the Godfather trilogy, he went on to direct the nauseously stifling Jack, a schlocky Robin Williams picture of Spielbergian pseudo-emotional magnitude), the young auteur has decided to proliferate her vile bacteria into the careers of other people.  It's a shame, because if Lost in Translation had been a different film entirely, like Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, it might have been good.  But as it is, it is pure garbage.  Try Monster or American Splendor, two wonderful films forgotten by the burgeoning circle jerk of American critics.  As for Lost in Translation, it definitely attests to the presumption I had that Roger Ebert is an imbecilic merger of words who's increasingly offal taste in movies (something that has never ceased to baffle me) is at the prompt vanguard of the declining state of film recognition.  Here is a man who can volubly opine for two hours on the eminent importance of Orson Wells' great progeny Citizen Kane and the surreal mastery of Fellini's 8 1/2, yet is so obdurately stubborn that he rejects the greatness of movies like Blue Velvet and favors this disposable garbage.  It may seem incredible, but remember that this agglutination of lard bestowed his prestigious and ever-cantankerous thumb of approval to such tripe as the Hulk and Blue Crush.  Bahh.There are moments here, though they may be evanescent, that begin to show signs of life - we are traduced into believing a character could delve beyond their static veneer and actually articulate a genuine emotion or two.  There was one scene in the movie when I was so stupid as to presume the torture would lessen and the movie would at least end with an inspired spark, no matter how uneven the events leading up to the denouement.  That scene was the karaoke scene, where Johannson's character bellows an uncertain and stodgy rendition of the Pretenders' ""Brass in Pocket.""  Subsequent to her performance, Bill Murray belts out an Elvis Costello tune.  But even as that aroused some interest it made me much more critical of the film's astronomical failure.  As he sang ""What's so funny about peace, love, and understanding"" I began to feel even more molested by my viewing experience.  I have realized why.  It seems that brief sequence is comparable to the film in its entirety.  It flirts with presence of life, it appears to be vibrant and amassed in the blinding neon lights of Japan, yet it reveals the story and the characters as lifeless, mirthless, miserable creatures who faintly utter disjointed nonsense without the slightest palpebration of energy.  The whole movie was so dreadfully absurd in its tragi-comic awfulness that it really made you think of the crooning losers who act like unproclaimed kings in karaoke bars.  Lost in Translation is like that.  Its amateurish, but not in the warm way of most independent movies.  It is stunningly pointless, an exercise in futile relations and even more of wayward characters who have not the capability to recognize their pitiable selves.  It's not that the characters allow their emotions to distract from their enactment with one another, no, it is something far more drab and lugubrious.  It is a representation of two faceless characters.  Two desparate people who cannot recognize the futility nor the audacity of their desparation.  I am reminded of the final scene when Murray says goodbye to Scarlet's character.  That one scene (coupled with the karaoke singing) provides explanation for the entire summarization of the movie.  It is endless and inauthentic, a documentation of absolutely nothing!  Yet it continues to prow along, moving forward despite the lack of enthusiasm or concern, not because Sofia is trying to convey some vague statement about the inefficacy of human relationships, nor because there was a point at all, merely because it is like its characters, it does not possess the proficiency to do anything else.Why do I anoint it with 5 stars then, if I so evidently despise it?  Because I get a sense of slight satisfaction with the thinking that maybe some lowly desk clerk at Tip Top Video will be perusing through the higher reviews for snobby affirmation of his devotion to this film, some dull expatiation about the esoteric quality of the movie and how others are fools not to appreciate it, only to unearth an inveighed condemnation of unquestionable disgust for a movie that barely qualifies as cannon fodder.",5,Ineptitude + Lethargy + Torpor= Oscar Gold,1078358400,"03 4, 2004",2004,9748,"['one', 'might', 'reasonably', 'surmise', 'due', 'excessively', 'positive',

The seemingly unsatisfying relationship between the young couple seemed forced and cliched, the young man appearing to be so remiss and so uncaring and such a parody of the young &quot;hip&quot; working artist. Again, in real life a joker like this would have been thanking his lucky stars for being with such a hottie and doing what he could to make sure she was enjoying herself and cared for in Tokyo.The film is really carried by the depth of the two main characters and the gradually appealing and whimsical nature of their pseudo-relationship.I cannot help but think that Coppola has taken the &quot;nepotism pays&quot; motif to such an all-time high that it's truly impossible to objectively review this work. The hype is way too high for what we actually get.I obviously enjoyed getting to know these characters but found the film ultimately lacking in substance. I just don't think that everything which is atmospheric and melancholic justifies the description of genius.Geeez, I hate to be such a naysayer on this one, I just found the boredom level to be a tad high relative to the expectations.

619277,A26GI8N3ADWGZ5,B00005JMJ4,"bsy ""bern""","[5, 6]","After watching Lost In Translation, I wanted to do two things: crawl into bed or go clubbing. I decided to hit the town. Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have the same choices: resign yourself to the negatives in your life or grab the bull by the horns. Contrasting dilemmas: Moving toward the end - midlife crisis vs. starting off on the bad foot - bad marriage. However, the strength of Lost in Translation (LIT) is that it works in stripping away their respective problems' details, runs them through a blender, and voila: you have two people who realize that their problems are quite similar. The only major difference being one of timing: one hasn't made the changes yet and procrastinates while the other still has the potential to change yet fears the outcome. The backdrop of Tokyo serves as the negativity amplifier in that it forces their dilemmas to surface faster than normal and with intensity.Most already know the story where a has-been actor is sent to Tokyo alone to film some TV ads (real actors who have done so: Harrison Ford, Jodie Foster, Bruce Willis, Penelope Cruz, etc) while the other is accompanying her husband on a business trip. They meet up and being the lost souls that they are, make a connection. Both Murray and Johansson play their respective character with aplomb, especially Murray who while stoic at times, relies on subtle gestures to give life to his character. For one who is used to seeing him only in comedies, it was refreshing and perhaps indicates that he has more potential than we ever thought. Johansson on the other hand, seems to be on valium and though she still displays oodles of potential, her role in Ghost World to me was her breakout film. Then again, her character does spend most of her time in bed.Lot's have been said about how LIT portrays Japan in a less than favorable light. Coming from a foreigner who has been living in Japan for close to a decade, I have to straddle the fence and say yes and no. It does provide every stereotype of the Japanese and some are true while others are grossly exaggerated. The difficult part is trying to understand director Coppola's intent. I'm left feeling that since the two main characters are new to Japan and are in transition, the corresponding views/images on Japan in the movie should reflect the typical foreign misconceptions and stereotypes (Japanese are not good at English, Japanese women are airy and immature, Japanese men are a masculine joke, etc.) We are seeing Japan through their eyes not through ones of a Japanophile who is planning to live and work there. If that were the case, I think you would have seen a very different Japan. In that sense, the images of Japan and the Japanese are appropriate. They are for the most part, wrong, very wrong but appropriate. Just remind yourself of that when watching LIT. You're seeing Japan through the eyes of two lost people, Westerners who have very little interest in being there.It was bit too slow for more liking and I was expecting a very different film image-wise from Coppola who so effectively used tones and colors in the Virgin Suicides. Though entertaining, I do question what the hype is all about. Truth is the setting could have been any foreign country (Japan being chosen because of the contrasts) and the result probably would have been the same because it's not the location as much as it the characters' fragile frames of minds that is the meat of the story.",3,Through Shaded & Troubled Western Eyes,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,3451,"['watching', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'wanted', 'do', 'two', 'things', 'crawl', 'bed', 'go', 'clubbing', 'decided', 'hit', 'town', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'have', 'same', 'choices', 'resign', 'negatives', 'life', 'grab', 'bull', 'horns', 'Contrasting', 'dilemmas', 'Moving', 'end', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'vs.', 'starting', 'off', 'bad', 'foot', 'bad', 'marriage', 'However', 'strength', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'LIT', 'stripping', 'away', 'respective', 'problems', 'details', 'blender', 'voila', 'have', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'realize', 'problems', 'are', 'quite', 'similar', 'only', 'major', 'difference', 'being', 'one', 'timing', 'one', ""n't"", 'made', 'changes', 'yet', 'procrastinates', 'other', 'still', 'potential', 'change', 'yet', 'outcome', 'backdrop', 'Tokyo', 'serves', 'negativity', 'amplifier', 'dilemmas', 'surface', 'faster', 'normal', 'intensity.Most', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'where', 'has-been', 'actor', 'sent', 'Tokyo', 'alone', 'film', 'TV', 'ads', 'real', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'etc', 'other', 'accompanying', 'husband', 'business', 'trip', 'meet', 'up', 'being', 'lost', 'souls', 'are', 'make', 'connection', 'Murray', 'Johansson', 'play', 'respective', 'character', 'aplomb', 'especially', 'Murray', 'who', 'stoic', 'times', 'relies', 'subtle', 'gestures', 'give', 'life', 'character', 'one', 'who', 'used', 'seeing', 'only', 'comedies', 'was', 'refreshing', 'perhaps', 'more', 'potential', 'ever', 'thought', 'Johansson', 'other', 'hand', 'be', 'valium', 'still', 'oodles', 'potential', 'role', 'Ghost', 'World', 'was', 'breakout', 'film', 'Then', 'again', 'character', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'bed.Lot', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'how', 'LIT', 'Japan', 'less', 'favorable', 'light', 'Coming', 'foreigner', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'Japan', 'close', 'decade', 'have', 'straddle', 'fence', 'say', 'yes', 'provide', 'stereotype', 'Japanese', 'are', 'true', 'others', 'are', 'grossly', 'exaggerated', 'difficult', 'part', 'trying', 'understand', 'director', 'Coppola', 'intent', ""'m"", 'left', 'feeling', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'new', 'Japan', 'are', 'transition', 'corresponding', 'views/images', 'Japan', 'movie', 'should', 'reflect', 'typical', 'foreign', 'misconceptions', 'stereotypes', 'Japanese', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'English', 'Japanese', 'women', 'are', 'airy', 'immature', 'Japanese', 'men', 'are', 'masculine', 'joke', 'etc', 'are', 'seeing', 'Japan', 'eyes', 'not', 'ones', 'Japanophile', 'who', 'planning', 'live', 'work', 'there', 'were', 'case', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'different', 'Japan', 'sense', 'images', 'Japan', 'Japanese', 'are', 'appropriate', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'wrong', 'very', 'wrong', 'appropriate', 'Just', 'remind', 'when', 'watching', 'LIT', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'Japan', 'eyes', 'two', 'lost', 'people', 'Westerners', 'who', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'interest', 'being', 'there.It', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'slow', 'more', 'liking', 'was', 'expecting', 'very', 'different', 'film', 'image-wise', 'Coppola', 'who', 'so', 'effectively', 'used', 'tones', 'colors', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'entertaining', 'do', 'question', 'what', 'hype', 'Truth', 'setting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'foreign', 'country', 'Japan', 'being', 'chosen', 'contrasts', 'result', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'not', 'location', 'as', 'much', 'characters', 'fragile', 'frames', 'minds', 'meat', 'story']",Lost in Translation

619287,A17N23WXA7EAF,B00005JMJ4,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[3, 4]","""Lost in Translation"" is director Sofia Coppola's remarkable study of the isolation and intimacy that people experience in both emotional and geographical environments. The film takes place in contemporary Tokyo where retired B-Movie actor, Bob Harris (Bill Murray) has come to film a commercial for a Japanese whiskey company. Harris spends his days enduring the bizarre yet entirely believable process of shooting a commercial in a country whose language and culture are completely beyond his understanding. He spends his evenings alone in the bedroom, the gym, or the bar of his lavish hotel where practically every moment seems surreal for one reason or another. In the bar, he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) who has followed her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi) to Tokyo where he is working on an extended project.At first, Bob and Charlotte develop a casual friendship based on their mutual sense of loneliness, lack of fulfillment, and their response to the sheer oddity of their surroundings. But soon their friendship develops into a deeper sense of understanding and intimacy, and with this come new complications. Both of them are married to spouses who for one reason or another are inaccessible, Bob is much older than Charlotte, and while he has experienced financial success and built a family, she is still at a point in her life where she is young and unsure of where she is headed. Charlotte almost never sees her husband, and the few times that she does he is busy cavorting with his colleagues and clients. Bob receives regular phone calls from his wife, but they only discuss her remodeling plans for their home.In the hands of an unskilled filmmaker, this situation would be ripe for all kinds of clich&eacute;d and predictable behavior. Instead, Coppola shapes their story with impressive ease and with an extraordinary understanding of the human soul. There is a lot of subtle stuff going on between Charlotte and Bob, but we never get bored or confused as their relationship develops and then conflicts arise. Similarly, despite the fact both characters are lost in Tokyo with its intense, pop-culture energy, the film never condemns or makes fun of that place. Like their personal lives, Tokyo for Bob and Charlotte is simply a space that they inhabit but in which they also feel utterly lost.While ""Lost in Translation"" explores some very serious themes it remains a hilarious and low-key film from start to finish. I have to agree with critics or reviewers who state that this is the best role of Bill Murray's career. Johansson also delivers an extremely skilled and subtle performance. There are also many extraordinarily funny scenes in which Bob and Charlotte find themselves interacting with people or in situations that they don't understand. During many of these scenes the film pulls no punches when it comes to fully exposing some of the more bizarre and eccentric qualities of contemporary Japanese culture.  Much to its credit, however the film does this in an upfront fashion without stooping to insults or stereotypes-it's simply too honest to do that.I highly recommend this film for its humor, its insight, and for the remarkable performances from Bill Murray, Scarlet Johansson, and the city of Tokyo. Coppola should be highly commended for her creative genius as a director and as a screenwriter.",5,"Brilliant, Hilarious Study of Human Isolation and Intimacy",1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,3359,"['Lost', 'Translation', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'remarkable', 'study', 'isolation', 'intimacy', 'people', 'experience', 'emotional', 'geographical', 'environments', 'film', 'place', 'contemporary', 'Tokyo', 'where', 'retired', 'B-Movie', 'actor', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'come', 'film', 'commercial', 'Japanese', 'whiskey', 'company', 'Harris', 'days', 'enduring', 'bizarre', 'yet', 'entirely', 'believable', 'process', 'shooting', 'commercial', 'country', 'language', 'culture', 'are', 'completely', 'understanding', 'evenings', 'alone', 'bedroom', 'gym', 'bar', 'lavish', 'hotel', 'where', 'practically', 'moment', 'surreal', 'one', 'reason', 'bar', 'Charlotte', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'followed', 'photographer', 'husband', 'John', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Tokyo', 'where', 'working', 'extended', 'project.At', 'first', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'develop', 'casual', 'friendship', 'based', 'mutual', 'sense', 'loneliness', 'lack', 'fulfillment', 'response', 'sheer', 'oddity', 'surroundings', 'soon', 'friendship', 'deeper', 'sense', 'understanding', 'intimacy', 'come', 'new', 'complications', 'are', 'married', 'spouses', 'who', 'one', 'reason', 'are', 'inaccessible', 'Bob', 'much', 'older', 'Charlotte', 'experienced', 'financial', 'success', 'built', 'family', 'still', 'point', 'life', 'where', 'young', 'unsure', 'where', 'headed', 'Charlotte', 'almost', 'never', 'husband', 'few', 'times', 'busy', 'cavorting', 'colleagues', 'clients', 'Bob', 'regular', 'phone', 'calls', 'wife', 'only', 'discuss', 'remodeling', 'plans', 'home.In', 'hands', 'unskilled', 'filmmaker', 'situation', 'would', 'be', 'ripe', 'kinds', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'predictable', 'behavior', 'Instead', 'Coppola', 'story', 'impressive', 'ease', 'extraordinary', 'understanding', 'human', 'soul', 'lot', 'subtle', 'stuff', 'going', 'Charlotte', 'Bob', 'never', 'get', 'bored', 'confused', 'relationship', 'develops', 'then', 'conflicts', 'arise', 'Similarly', 'fact', 'characters', 'are', 'lost', 'Tokyo', 'intense', 'pop-culture', 'energy', 'film', 'never', 'fun', 'place', 'personal', 'lives', 'Tokyo', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'simply', 'space', 'inhabit', 'also', 'feel', 'utterly', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'very', 'serious', 'themes', 'hilarious', 'low-key', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'have', 'agree', 'critics', 'reviewers', 'who', 'state', 'best', 'role', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'career', 'Johansson', 'also', 'extremely', 'skilled', 'subtle', 'performance', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'extraordinarily', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'find', 'interacting', 'people', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'many', 'scenes', 'film', 'punches', 'when', 'fully', 'exposing', 'more', 'bizarre', 'eccentric', 'qualities', 'contemporary', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Much', 'credit', 'however', 'film', 'upfront', 'fashion', 'stooping', 'insults', 'stereotypes-it', 'simply', 'too', 'honest', 'do', 'that.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'humor', 'insight', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'city', 'Tokyo', 'Coppola', 'should', 'be', 'highly', 'commended', 'creative', 'genius', 'director', 'screenwriter']",Lost in Translation
619288,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00005JMJ4,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[3, 7]","The opening shot is of Scarlett Johansson, but it's influenced by a painting by John Kacere, whose painting shows up later in the hotel. Actually, it is a shot of a certain portion of Scarlett Johansson's anatomy. Not bare, though. No, that would be gross. Not exactly her torso... lower... lower... there. The other side, now. Flip it over. That's it. Scarlett Johansson was reluctant to film this scene, but Sofia Coppola, the Director, modeled how the shot would look; and then she agreed to do it.This anecdote has me convinced that Sofia Coppola felt a strong identification with the main character. As a Director Sofia Coppola is willing to go that extra mile. Charlotte IS Sofia; but instead of John (Giovanni Ribisi), the photographer, it was her former husband, Spike Jonze, the director. He directed Cameron Diaz in Being John Malkovich, and perhaps Sofia felt kind of neglected, just like Charlotte--though Coppola denied the connection in an Entertainment Weekly interview.I know that writers use their own personal experience, and yet they change it, and they are not accountable for any similarity to any persons, living or dead. Especially themselves. But how many thinly veiled autobiographical first novels has the world seen?So, if Charlotte was Sofia, Kelly (Anna Faris) was Cameron, and John was Spike, who was Bob Harris? Who was the older gentleman that she had the Platonic Affair with? Was it John Malkovich? Really? John Malkovich?Why then, did she insist on casting Bill Murray, and only Bill Murray? Bill Murray doesn't even have an agent, and if anyone wants to hire him for anything, they have to leave voice mail on a number that he rarely, if ever, even listens to. Sofia left hundreds of messages for him. She flew to Japan to begin filming, and still she hadn't heard back from Murray. If he didn't show up, she was prepared to shut down the production. It most likely wasn't Bill Murray in real life, but Sofia knew that Bill Murray was the only one who could do the part justice. Unless it WAS Malkovich in real life, and she cast Malkovich. But that would blow her cover.The Japan in Lost in Translation was lost in translation. I think that all the Japanese stuff was merely an extended metaphor for feeling alienated from your environment. Like The Vapors song, Turning Japanese, it was a metaphor for something else. Japan is an interesting backdrop, but I think the movie is really about Bob and Charlotte. Karaoke and the neon lights of Tokyo are an interesting backdrop, but Lost in Translation is not about Japan, per se.If I can go off on one tangent per review, then I'd like to interject that Sofia Coppola is not David Lynch's daughter, and she did not make Boxing Helena. You take two famous directors with daughters, both trying to break into Hollywood as directors, and it is perfectly understandable that you might get them mixed up. But they are two distinct personalities. So don't blame Boxing Helena, one of, if not THE worst movie ever made, on Sofia Coppola (by the way, does anyone know where I could get a copy of boxing Helena?).--------------Bob: Can you keep a secret? I'm trying to organize a prison break. I'm looking for, like, an accomplice. We have to first get out of this bar, then the hotel, then the city, and then the country. Are you in or you out?Charlotte: I'm in. I'll go pack my stuff.Bob: I hope that you've had enough to drink. It's going to take courage.====================Bob Harris is brilliantly played by Bill Murray, and Bob's interactions with Charlotte/Scarlett are sublime. It is no wonder that Bill Murray was Sofia's choice. Every detail of his character rang true. Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin's ""Fantaisie Impromptu"" in C sharp minor, Opus 66 is the ring tone on Bob's cell phone. Murray played well not only with Johansson, but his constant befuddlement with the strange Japanese environment was quite entertaining.--------------Bob: I don't want to leave.Charlotte: So don't. Stay here with me. We'll start a jazz band.==================Anna Faris as Kelly was a brilliant caricature of Cameron Diaz. Kelly is ignorant and proud of her ignorance. Cameron Diaz might not really be that thick, but if you were a neglected newlywed, it might seem like Diaz was your nitwitted nemesis, Kelly. Especially if your husband was directing her in Being John Malkovich while you were on the sidelines worrying. Charlotte is bothered by people like Kelly because Charlotte is smart, but she has yet to figure out what to do with her intelligence. Unless she can bring it out in some tangible form she will constantly be upstaged by those with little substance but a more dazzling surface--the Kellies of this world.For Sofia, the answer was to direct films. That would show Spike Jonze, Cameron Diaz, and most of all, her father, that she had a head on her shoulders. Too bad she had to make Marie Antoinette, and reverse that decision.The Bottom Line is that Sofia Coppola managed to direct a wonderful film, drawing on her own experience, but translating it into terms we all could understand. She told her story, and it was not Lost in Translation.-------------Kelly: But listen, let's all go out for a drink sometimes. Yeah?John: Yeah, yeah.Kelly: You know, call me, okay?John: Yeah, okay.Kelly: Alright. Listen, I'm under Evelyn Waugh. Shh, okay?Charlotte: [after Kelly leaves] Evelyn Waugh? Evelyn Waugh was a man.John: Oh, come on, she's nice. What? You know, not everybody went to Yale. It's just a pseudonym, for Christ's sake.=======================Vicky Cristina Barcelona(2008) Scarlett Johansson was CristinaMarie Antoinette(2006) Directed by Sofia CoppolaMatch Point(2005) Scarlett

619290,AYJ6P9F8GX9XF,B00005JMJ4,Cecily Champagne,"[6, 9]","The premise of `Lost in Translation' is simple.  Bob (Murray) is a middle-aged actor who is unhappy with his career and feels distanced from his family.  He travels abroad  - rather begrudgingly - to star in a Japanese whiskey commercial .  Charlotte (Johansson) is a young, attractive, and slightly elitist Yale graduate.  She is married to a busy photographer but doesn't seem to have much direction in her own life.  Eventually, Bob and Charlotte meet in the bar of a Tokyo hotel.  They connect immediately, which makes sense, because they have a lot in common.  Both - despite outwardly wonderful lives - are feeling lonely and isolated, and both have been doing some pretty heavy thinking ... about relationships, about their pasts, about their futures, and (however cliche it might sound) about the meaning of life.  One of the things I love about this film is that it handles the characters' contemplativeness very gently.  Take the scene where Charlotte is talking on the telephone to a friend (this is one of the most poignant moments in the film).  Earlier that day, she had stumbled upon a seemingly ancient religious ceremony, somewhere in the lush outskirts of the city.  But, as she admits to her friend, ""I didn't feel anything.""  Although her comment is a bit vague and understated, we get the sense that Charlotte is frightened by her detachment and nihilistic leanings.While Bob and Charlotte are not able to provide ""answers"" for one another, they are able to enjoy an emotional relationship.  The movie follows them as they spend time together exploring the hotel and the city - sometimes having outrageous fun (drinking to excess and singing karaoke) and sometimes just sitting quietly and talking.  Although this film is subtle and slow-moving and many will find it dull (just look at the reviews below - I mean, some people are down-right angry!), others - like me - will be absorbed.  The cinematography is stunning, and a lot of fabulous, dreamy music is used in the soundtrack (My Bloody Valentine complements the film's tone perfectly).  I also think that 'Lost in Translation' can be quite humorous, in its own, quiet way.  For instance, when Charlotte and her husband bump into a young actress in the hotel lobby, it is rather amusing to contrast Charlotte's calm, cool, and sharp personality with that of the ridiculously bubbly chatterbox.  I would also add that this film's final scene makes for one of the most perfect and simple endings I have ever come across (I am reminded of the PJ Harvey song ""You Said Something"").In conclusion, if you can handle a slow-moving film, if you enjoy intelligent characters, and if you are attracted to stunning images, you may very well like this film.

This is not a mainstream movie by any stretch of the imagination.  Some people think that any movie with such a description is for film snobs only.  Whatever, but I don't think you have to be a film snob to be affected by &quot;Lost In Translation&quot;.  You just need to appreciate the concept of a time, place, and a combination of people.  That is basically what the movie is.  There's no trajectory to the plot, really.  It just takes you through a few days and nights in modern Japan, with two different people from different generations yet with complementary mental states.  Either the viewer is with these people or s/he is not.  That's why I am surprised by its success, because I wouldn't think that many people would care.  I think they only really care about Bill Murray, and want to laugh.  Most of those people will be disappointed.  It doesn't mean they can't appreciate a good movie, it just means they aren't in it for the short ride.  I'm sure that if many of those people revisit the film in 10 or 20 years, they might think differently.  And that is always the true test of a great film.  I am looking forward to seeing if it holds up over time.But not for nothing, at least try to enjoy two of the years best performances on film.  Young Scarlett deserves just as much attention as Bill does.  Her pitch was perfect all throughout, just the way I would have wanted it if I were the director.  And I for one thought the ending was just right.  I would have been tempted to go for a more sentimental conclusion, but this one is very moving nonetheless.Another reason why I liked this movie so much is because it sort of reminds me of my favorite film, &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;.  That hardly ever happens.  It's interesting to see it in a modern context with different dynamics, though the basic themes of loneliness and redemption through human contact are there.

That's cool.&quot;  This isn't.  Despite its critical acclaim, those of us who are actually looking for a purposeful story in &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; will come out emptyhanded.Basically, the film is about two American losers (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson) who are in Tokyo and hate it.  They hate the people, they hate the sights, they hate the food, they hate communicating with their spouses--basically, they think their lives are unbelievably stupid.  Then, in a chance meeting at a hotel bar, the two forge a friendship, just because there aren't too many other English-speakers nearby.  They go around the city together, complaining about their pathetic lives and attempting to further dig themselves into depression.  This all makes for a deathly boring film that isn't worth a second glance.  I can honestly say that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; has become my least favorite movie of all time.  It is so bad that I can't even remember any of the characters names.So why do I hate it so much?  Besides its ability to put me to sleep, this flick is full of so many dark emotions--sadness, irritation, longing, depression, hate.  Bill Murray doesn't smile once in the movie.  If he and Johansson's childlike character can't stand their lives so much, why don't they do something about it?  They moan and whine and pass judgement on everything in Japan but never try to make themselves happy.  Instead, they should go back to the States, divorce their spouses, and do whatever it is they like to do.  Don't complain about their idiotic lives if they put no effort into changing them.  Instead of inspiring feelings of joy and excitement, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; made me feel gloomy and upset.  Nearly everyone would love the opportunity to travel freely or appear on TV or stay in world-class hotels--I would do anything to visit Japan--and here are these two ingrates, in Tokyo of their own accord, loathing every minute of it.If you do pick up this movie, don't even bother with the DVD extras.  The deleted scenes were well deleted (actually, they should have deleted the entire movie).  The interview with Murray and writer/director Sofia Coppola is just as lousy.  For as many awards as her original movie received, Coppola seems highly unenthusiastic about it.  In fact, she seems downright P.O.'d that she is doing the interview.  Murray is similarly bored and displays a bit of arrogance.  What for?  The end of the movie is exactly the same as the beginning--no closure, no resolution, no reason for existing.Pass the popcorn--you're better off passing this one by!",1,WHY Would You Wanna See This?,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,2738,"['quot', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'open-minded', 'quot', 'told', 'video', 'store', 'quot', 'Even', 'little', 'quirky', 'like', 'quirky', 'cool.', 'quot', ""n't"", 'critical', 'acclaim', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'looking', 'purposeful', 'story', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'emptyhanded.Basically', 'film', 'about', 'two', 'American', 'losers', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'are', 'Tokyo', 'hate', 'hate', 'people', 'hate', 'sights', 'hate', 'food', 'hate', 'communicating', 'spouses', 'basically', 'think', 'lives', 'are', 'unbelievably', 'stupid', 'Then', 'chance', 'meeting', 'hotel', 'bar', 'two', 'forge', 'friendship', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'other', 'English-speakers', 'nearby', 'go', 'city', 'together', 'complaining', 'pathetic', 'lives', 'attempting', 'further', 'dig', 'depression', 'deathly', 'boring', 'film', ""n't"", 'worth', 'second', 'glance', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'become', 'least', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'so', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'characters', 'names.So', 'why', 'do', 'hate', 'so', 'much', 'ability', 'put', 'sleep', 'flick', 'full', 'so', 'many', 'dark', 'emotions', 'sadness', 'irritation', 'longing', 'depression', 'hate', 'Bill', 'Murray', ""n't"", 'smile', 'once', 'movie', 'Johansson', 'childlike', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'lives', 'so', 'much', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'something', 'moan', 'whine', 'pass', 'judgement', 'everything', 'Japan', 'never', 'try', 'make', 'happy', 'Instead', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'States', 'divorce', 'spouses', 'do', 'whatever', 'do', 'Do', ""n't"", 'complain', 'idiotic', 'lives', 'put', 'effort', 'changing', 'Instead', 'inspiring', 'feelings', 'joy', 'excitement', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'made', 'feel', 'gloomy', 'upset', 'Nearly', 'everyone', 'would', 'love', 'opportunity', 'travel', 'freely', 'appear', 'TV', 'stay', 'world-class', 'hotels', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'visit', 'Japan', 'here', 'are', 'two', 'ingrates', 'Tokyo', 'own', 'accord', 'loathing', 'minute', 'it.If', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'DVD', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'deleted', 'actually', 'should', 'have', 'deleted', 'entire', 'movie', 'interview', 'Murray', 'writer/director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'just', 'lousy', 'many', 'awards', 'original', 'movie', 'received', 'Coppola', 'highly', 'unenthusiastic', 'fact', 'downright', 'P.O', ""'d"", 'doing', 'interview', 'Murray', 'similarly', 'bored', 'bit', 'arrogance', 'What', 'end', 'movie', 'exactly', 'same', 'beginning', 'closure', 'resolution', 'reason', 'existing.Pass', 'popcorn', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'passing', 'one']",Lost in Translation

619300,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B00005JMJ4,Christopher Culver,"[3, 3]","For all the acclaim Sofia Coppola's film LOST IN TRANSLATION won upon its release in 2003, I didn't expect the film to have much staying power. For one, upon every viewing one gets increasing peturbed by its treatment of the Japanese, among whom washed-up American actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and recent college graduate Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) find themselves. Bob is in town to film a whiskey commercial, while Charlotte accompanies her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi), who swiftly leaves her alone in her hotel while he goes off to a shoot. Bob, experiencing a midlife crisis, finds company with Charlotte, who is experiencing her own uncertainties the future of her marriage and her ability to establish a career. Together they survive their week among an alien culture with an immense language barrier. Are Coppola's jokes about the Japanese (l/r confusion in phrases like ""lip my stockings"") adequate ways of expressing Bob and Charlotte's difficulties, or are they just cheap shots? Should we condemn Bob and Charlotte for making so little effort to adapt to their surrounding society, or should we empathize with their difficulties? The cultural issues surrounding LOST IN TRANSLATION might be perennial.But as I saw this film yet again recently, I find it very thought-provoking, and that certainly makes it stand out among Hollywood productions of these times. As Bob enjoys a night out on the town courtesy of Charlotte, hitting the bars and then going to an after-party in some flat where he smokes up and sings karaoke, we wonder about the possibility of regaining lost youth. When Bob ultimately kisses Charlotte at the close of the film, we are led to question whether merely platonic friendships of the sort they had established earlier can really last. And certainly, regardless of its occasional depiction of Tokyo dwellers as weird, the film does inspire a great desire to visit Japan and see it for oneself. The visuals of LOST IN TRANSLATION are occasionally so lovely that they leave the plot behind.The film is also has Bill Murray's best performance of his post-GROUNDHOG DAY period, where he became an expert at depicting jadedness. Here this air of being total disinterested in his surroundings is tempered by a warm humanity. Johansson's acting, on the other hand, may be the film's weakest aspect. Regrettably, her presence in the film works only when she is basically just an object, which Coppola often uses her as (the opening shot is of her pantied buttocks as she lies in bed).",4,"Occasionally problematic in its treatment of its setting, but an authentically thought-provoking film",1230163200,"12 25, 2008",2008,2527,"['acclaim', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'film', 'LOST', 'IN', 'TRANSLATION', 'won', 'release', '2003', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'have', 'much', 'staying', 'power', 'one', 'viewing', 'one', 'increasing', 'peturbed', 'treatment', 'Japanese', 'whom', 'washed-up', 'American', 'actor', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'recent', 'college', 'graduate', 'Charlotte', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'find', 'Bob', 'town', 'film', 'whiskey', 'commercial', 'Charlotte', 'photographer', 'husband', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'who', 'swiftly', 'alone', 'hotel', 'off', 'shoot', 'Bob', 'experiencing', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'company', 'Charlotte', 'who', 'experiencing', 'own', 'uncertainties', 'future', 'marriage', 'ability', 'establish', 'career', 'Together', 'survive', 'week', 'alien', 'culture', 'immense', 'language', 'barrier', 'Are', 'Coppola', 'jokes', 'Japanese', 'l/r', 'confusion', 'phrases', 'lip', 'stockings', 'adequate', 'ways', 'expressing', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'difficulties', 'are', 'just', 'cheap', 'shots', 'Should', 'condemn', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'making', 'so', 'little', 'effort', 'adapt', 'surrounding', 'society', 'should', 'empathize', 'difficulties', 'cultural', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'LOST', 'IN', 'TRANSLATION', 'might', 'be', 'perennial.But', 'saw', 'film', 'yet', 'again', 'recently', 'find', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'certainly', 'stand', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'times', 'Bob', 'night', 'out', 'town', 'courtesy', 'Charlotte', 'hitting', 'bars', 'then', 'going', 'after-party', 'flat', 'where', 'up', 'sings', 'karaoke', 'wonder', 'possibility', 'regaining', 'lost', 'youth', 'When', 'Bob', 'ultimately', 'Charlotte', 'close', 'film', 'are', 'led', 'question', 'merely', 'platonic', 'friendships', 'sort', 'had', 'established', 'earlier', 'can', 'really', 'last', 'certainly', 'regardless', 'occasional', 'depiction', 'Tokyo', 'dwellers', 'weird', 'film', 'inspire', 'great', 'desire', 'visit', 'Japan', 'see', 'visuals', 'LOST', 'IN', 'TRANSLATION', 'are', 'occasionally', 'so', 'lovely', 'leave', 'plot', 'behind.The', 'film', 'also', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'best', 'performance', 'post-GROUNDHOG', 'DAY', 'period', 'where', 'became', 'expert', 'depicting', 'jadedness', 'Here', 'air', 'being', 'total', 'disinterested', 'surroundings', 'tempered', 'warm', 'humanity', 'Johansson', 'acting', 'other', 'hand', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'weakest', 'aspect', 'Regrettably', 'presence', 'film', 'only', 'when', 'basically', 'just', 'object', 'Coppola', 'often', 'opening', 'shot', 'pantied', 'buttocks', 'bed']",Lost in Translation

It resonated in a way that only handful of films ever have or will... which in itself is the mark of a truly great film.

When I saw &quot;lost in translation&quot; in the theaters a few months back, I couldn't believe the transformation of funnyman Bill Murray into a serious, middle aged man.  The part could not have been played better, or by anyone else.  The story of the film is quite simple, a man (murray) travels over to japan to shoot a couple vodka commericals in hopes of making a decent dollar.  He's married, and yet unsatisfied and doesn't know where to turn.  Enter scarlet johannson, who plays a newleywed that has the same feelings over her own marriage.  Her husband is too transfixed in his photography career that they hardly spend much time together.  It is only a matter of time before the two souls meet and begin to converse on how they are standing.Really a beautiful film, and astonishing to note that it took just under 4 weeks to film.  Sophia Coppola really displayed an amazing effort, directing, writing, and I believe producing the film.  There is no doubt this film belongs in my top 10 favorites, if not the top 5.  Hey, I'm a nice man, maybe I can sneak it into my top 3.  You would have no idea what you are missing if you calmly skip over this film.

Since its release, this story about a middle-aged actor and a young newlywed who form a bittersweet friendship during their stay in Tokyo, topped just about every critic's Ten Best lists for 2003; it made a pile of money; and it's been nominated for most of the major Academy Awards.That's a heavy weight for a little movie to bear and ""Lost"" is a little movie. It's the kind of fragile, off-beat sleeper that usually falls beneath the mainstream radar: It has a slow pace, an odd structure and hardly any story at all; it's funny but not quite a comedy, sad but not quite a drama. The main characters, played by Scarlett Johansson and the recently Oscar nominated Bill Murray, are sympathetic but cold to everyone except each other, and they're both moping around a mighty fine five-star hotel.So now that ""Lost"" has been released on DVD to a much wider audience, will it face a backlash from viewers who watch it expecting too much and wonder, ""What's the big deal?""Many of the reviews here indicate a &quot;yes&quot; in answer to that question, which seems a shame because ""Lost,"" while not exactly your typical crowd-pleaser, is a subtle modern classic.Viewers who haven't seen it but have heard the massive hype surrounding it should keep their expectations in check and focus on the movie's simple pleasures: a careful script by writer-director Sofia Coppola; beautiful cinematography by Lance Acord; and a great, Bogart-esque performance by Murray - aside from possibly (possibly) Al Pacino, I can't think of a fifty-something actor other than Murray who could pull off the character's complicated mix of humor and seriousness.I actually found that &quot;Lost&quot;, with its lonely characters and late night settings, improves on home video.  It's a movie best suited to watching alone in the wee small hours of the morning, and its ending left me feeling a nostalgia usually reserved for movies like &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; and &quot;American Graffiti.&quot;",4,Try to ignore the overexposure; Lost is a great LITTLE movie,1077321600,"02 21, 2004",2004,2074,"['As', 'good', 'movie', 'almost', 'feels', 'fluke', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'found', 'so', 'much', 'success', 'release', 'story', 'middle-aged', 'actor', 'young', 'newlywed', 'who', 'form', 'bittersweet', 'friendship', 'stay', 'Tokyo', 'topped', 'just', 'critic', 'Ten', 'Best', '2003', 'made', 'pile', 'money', 'been', 'nominated', 'most', 'major', 'Academy', 'Awards.That', 'heavy', 'weight', 'little', 'movie', 'bear', 'Lost', 'little', 'movie', 'kind', 'fragile', 'off-beat', 'sleeper', 'usually', 'mainstream', 'radar', 'slow', 'pace', 'odd', 'structure', 'hardly', 'story', 'funny', 'not', 'quite', 'comedy', 'sad', 'not', 'quite', 'drama', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'recently', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'cold', 'everyone', 'other', ""'re"", 'moping', 'around', 'mighty', 'fine', 'five-star', 'hotel.So', 'now', 'Lost', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'much', 'wider', 'audience', 'will', 'face', 'backlash', 'viewers', 'who', 'watch', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'wonder', 'What', 'big', 'deal', 'Many', 'reviews', 'here', 'indicate', 'quot', 'quot', 'answer', 'question', 'shame', 'Lost', 'not', 'exactly', 'typical', 'crowd-pleaser', 'subtle', 'modern', 'classic.Viewers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'have', 'heard', 'massive', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'should', 'keep', 'expectations', 'check', 'focus', 'movie', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'careful', 'script', 'writer-director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Lance', 'Acord', 'great', 'Bogart-esque', 'performance', 'Murray', 'aside', 'possibly', 'possibly', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'fifty-something', 'actor', 'other', 'Murray', 'who', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'character', 'complicated', 'mix', 'humor', 'seriousness.I', 'actually', 'found', 'quot', 'Lost', 'quot', 'lonely', 'characters', 'late', 'night', 'settings', 'improves', 'home', 'video', 'movie', 'best', 'suited', 'watching', 'alone', 'wee', 'small', 'hours', 'morning', 'ending', 'left', 'feeling', 'nostalgia', 'usually', 'reserved', 'movies', 'quot', 'Before', 'Sunrise', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Graffiti.', 'quot']",Lost in Translation

Bob knows that he has been almost not heard of by the young generation in his country, and no longer spoken of by the generation who once loved his films. He gets more praise and respect from the people in Japan. When he first arrives at the hotel in Tokyo, he is greeted and treated by some of the strangest and often hilarious characters as you'll see. He sits continually in the bar staring into space, waiting out his time to go home.On the other side of the fence is Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte, a mysterious young woman who is half Bob's age, who he begins to fixate on and she on him. Charlotte is married to a youthful and famous photographer working on an important shoot in Tokyo, and so she spends her days (like Bob), staring out into space - searching for something that will never come in that image she stares at. It seems like every time Bob and Charlotte step out of their rooms, somehow they see each other...whether it be in the elevator, in the swimming pool hall, or at the bar...they see each other. Soon, they realize that each of them are looking for pretty much the same thing: life. When Charlotte asks Bob to come with her to meet a few friends, the two come together like pages in a book being binded. At first, it simply seems like a harmless, strong friendship, but in reality, both know that it is a beautiful affair relationship as Bob has his wife and kids at home, and Charlotte has her husband taking photos every day.  The sad thing is, is that they both know that the relationship which has become so close and real, will never last and that eventually Bob will have to leave...Sofia Coppola's masterful direction and the beautiful atmosphere create an overall atmospheric and well-crafted tale of love and curiosity of the unknown. Coppola writes with such realistic tension and style that it was almost as if I saw these characters outside my bedroom window, or as if they were one of my own family members. The entire story is touching and heartwarming, filled with hilarious moments along the way. The connection between Murray and Johanssan is pure magical and the two of them seem meant to be. The difference between ages of the two makes it even more a touching film as Charlotte seeks out love, kindness and attention from Bob and he seeks out the same thing from her. The music is another excellent thing about this film, as it adds the modern touch to the images captured from this modern city of Tokyo, Japan. Some of the music is rock and roll which we are all familiar with which adds a sense of familiarity to the characters in the story.I can sum up all of my review with one word.

619308,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00005JMJ4,C. Middleton,"[2, 3]","This is a charming and subtle tale of a twenty something woman and a middle-aged film star who happen to cross paths while visiting Japan. John Harris (Bill Murray) has been given a lucrative sponsorship deal, promoting a Japanese whiskey, and is confronted by a few cultural barriers, mainly language, which he handles in obvious and hilarious ways. One of the funniest scenes in the picture is his two-minute stint on a cross trainer machine that runs out if his control. This is run of the mill slapstick humour at its best, pulled off in that familiar Murray style, which even now, when I think of it, brings tears to my eyes. In fact, this really is the only piece of slapstick in the entire film, because what makes this picture special is the subtle dialogue between the two main characters. There's no over acting in this film, but an understated realism and tasteful honesty, which to my mind, should bring a few industry awards to first time director, Sofia Coppola.Bill Murrey has come a long way over the last twenty years or so. He is one of the world's most funny comedians, with his own unique signature, and has finally reached a point in his craft, where doing a `serious' role will not upset his many fans. He tried this early on in his career, playing the role of Larry, in the second film adaptation of Somerset Maugham's, `The Razors Edge'. Tyron Power played in the original and, of course, this was an impossible act to follow. We did not take him seriously back then, ironically, his performance was superb. In the role of John Harris, the character demanded a particular charm, sophistication and worldliness along with an attitude of self-deprecating humour, which Murrey captured brilliantly, revealing a man at the top of his form. Scarlett Johansson also commanded a fine performance as the lonely and abandoned, Charlotte - her close ups encapsulating every emotion and nuance in each and every scene.

DeRiemer,"[5, 9]","I thought Lost in Translation was a subtle, charming movie that flowed easily from light-weight smiles to something approaching a mature understanding of people and relationships.Why do some react so strongly against it? Well, a brutal summary of what some see on the screen, I think, is this: Two people meet. They talk. They look at each other. They talk. They look at each other. They talk. They part.Except for the comedy, everything else pretty much comes from reading between the lines, taking the clues about the two people's lives and letting your imagination (and your own experiences) fill in the rest. Which is why, I think, the ending when they part and you don't have the slightest idea what he has whispered in her ear except what you'd like that whisper to be, gives some people the fits. The movie also is both funny and sad...an uneasy combination for some.If a person is going to enjoy this movie, he or she has to sit back and do a little personal projection onto the characters. It helps if the person has had some experience with loneliness as well as happiness. People who are more comfortable with explicit story lines with clear action probably aren't at ease doing this.My only complaint, which I recognize if answered would have ruined the movie, is that if the Murrray character had tried even a little to look beyond his hotel and himself he would have found a Japan of great variety and depth. The movie played to the most condescending of Western attitudes about Japan. At least it was good natured, as far as condescension can be.But it was a sweet movie and, in my view, Murray was robbed at the Academy Awards.",4,"Quirky, Romantic...and Make Up Your Own Ending",1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,1643,"['thought', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'was', 'subtle', 'charming', 'movie', 'flowed', 'easily', 'light-weight', 'smiles', 'something', 'approaching', 'mature', 'understanding', 'people', 'relationships.Why', 'do', 'react', 'so', 'strongly', 'Well', 'brutal', 'summary', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'think', 'Two', 'people', 'meet', 'talk', 'look', 'other', 'talk', 'look', 'other', 'talk', 'part.Except', 'comedy', 'everything', 'else', 'pretty', 'much', 'reading', 'lines', 'taking', 'clues', 'two', 'people', 'lives', 'letting', 'imagination', 'own', 'experiences', 'fill', 'rest', 'Which', 'why', 'think', 'ending', 'when', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'slightest', 'idea', 'what', 'whispered', 'ear', 'what', ""'d"", 'like', 'whisper', 'be', 'people', 'fits', 'movie', 'also', 'funny', 'sad', 'uneasy', 'combination', 'some.If', 'person', 'going', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'sit', 'back', 'do', 'little', 'personal', 'projection', 'characters', 'person', 'had', 'experience', 'loneliness', 'as', 'well', 'happiness', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'comfortable', 'explicit', 'story', 'lines', 'clear', 'action', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'ease', 'doing', 'only', 'complaint', 'recognize', 'answered', 'would', 'have', 'ruined', 'movie', 'Murrray', 'character', 'had', 'tried', 'even', 'little', 'look', 'hotel', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'Japan', 'great', 'variety', 'depth', 'movie', 'played', 'most', 'condescending', 'Western', 'attitudes', 'Japan', 'least', 'was', 'good', 'natured', 'as', 'far', 'condescension', 'can', 'be.But', 'was', 'sweet', 'movie', 'view', 'Murray', 'was', 'robbed', 'Academy', 'Awards']",Lost in Translation

Because nobody speaks English there and they can't understand anything and they have no-one to talk to. So what can they do? They phone home and whine. And then they whine even more because the people at home got tired of listening to their whining and hung up on them.So then what? So they sit in the lounge of the hotel and drink and mope. And mope, mope and mope. And then they spot each other. HEY! A white face! Woohoo! Oh, what relief! He'll understand English! Of course, he's White!Groovy. So now they have someone to commiserate with. Oh, what joy it is to finally find someone who understands just how horrible it is to be stuck in this miserable hell for one whole week, where everything is Japanese. So they hatch their &quot;escape plan&quot;. Escape what? All this -ugh!- un-American-ness!So they &quot;escape&quot; out of their hotel prison. She decides to visit a friend. Oh, she has a friend there? And she only visits him as a last resort? What a lovely friend she makes! The two pass through a video arcade and she stares at the people there and the &quot;strange&quot; things they do. They sit spellbound in front of gambling machines. Weird! Some dance to the games, some play guitar. Weird! They then go karaoke-ing with a bunch of locals. They are all drunk and sing out of tune. Sigh... So what is a nice white girl to do but to take the mic herself and show these stupid Japanese people just what good singing really means!There is always much to do and see in a foreign land.

That interestingness may have been their looks, their quirks, their persona, or some indefinable `otherness'. Well, that's what the film Lost In Translation is- it's not a bad film, nor nearly as good as its reputation proclaims, but it is unlike just about any other Hollywood or indie film to come down the pike in the last few decades.That it was nominated for and won a screenwriting Oscar for director Sofia Coppola is just plain silly since the film's resonance and character creation comes from its visual images, not its too spare writing. An aging, former American film star named Bob Harris (Bill Murray) comes to Tokyo to film an ad for a brand of scotch. Like many American film stars in real life who refuse such stateside, lest oddly believe they'll dampen their credibility as actors, he accepts the enormous sum the Japanese sponsors offer him- $2 million- for a week or so's work. There he meets the Gen Y wife of a hip young photographer named Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). They have little in common save their shared loneliness and insomnia when Charlotte's husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) goes off for a few days on a shoot. Charlotte is a typically aimless young soul who peripatetically bounces between wanting to write or photograph, & seeking an outlet for her philosophy degree from Yale, while Bob is a lethargic middle aged man who's not so much in crisis mode as he is in ennui to the cosmos.... Still, as stated, the movie's visuals are its real charm- the scenes of Tokyo's night life, neon, the odd angles that Charlotte looks down upon life from in her hotel room, and especially a beautifully filmed, yet hauntingly lonely shot of Bob playing golf in the foreground of Mount Fuji, add almost enough poetic resonance to the characters that the script lacks to pull off a viewer's belief in their romance. Sofia's brother made a far superior film a few years ago that dealt with many of the same themes of alienation.

First, it is so wonderful to have a film about actual people moving through something approaching a real life on the road overseas.  If you've ever traveled on business in a different culture you will recognize how this actually feels and how it intensifies the stage of life in which the two main characters find themselves.Isn't it wonderful that there are NO explosions, no 'action', no murders, mayhem, or monsters?  Just actual human characters with failings and emotions.Bill Murray does so much with such complexity and subtlety that my appreciation for him has grown even deeper.  Just a superb job.  Scarlett Johansson is also quite special and memorable in this role.  There is a pair of scenes that epitomizes what these two pull off together (there are many more wonderful scenes than this example).  They are just before and just after Bill Murray is forced to open his door when he doesn't want to and Scarlett Johansson is on the other side wanting to ask him to lunch and he wants to go, but he can't just then and she understands why.  His embarrassment and disgust with himself and her disappointment, hurt, and let down is sad but a wonderful scene to behold.  They pull this off with a power that distills real life.The film seems to work hard for its R rating.

The film plays like one long beautiful dream of friendship and shared experiences in an alternate universe.The film's plot is simple. Two Americans-a mid-50's, washed up actor played by Bill Murrray and a young, married Yale graduate played by Johansson-find themselves lost in Tokyo for a week. They're not really lost of course: Murray is there to shoot a TV commercial and Johansson to accompany her hip photographer husband. But being set adrift in the bright lights of Tokyo makes each realize how lost they are in their own lives. Murray's character is going through a classic mid-life crisis while Johansson's character is undergoing a more unusual beginning of life crisis.They connect in the hotel bar after seeing each other at various venues. Slowly and subtly a lovely, amazing friendship develops. They are at the same stage of their lives emotionally if not chronologically. And that's the beauty of the movie: how at a disparate moment of time, two souls can connect on an emotional and not a physical level.The frenzy of Tokyo day and night life provides a powerful counterpoint to the slowly unfolding friendship. Coppola has an amazing eye for the scenes and sights that tell a story--she gives you just enough of the neon lights and just enough of the green zen gardens to make you feel as if you are in Tokyo.I would recommend this movie to those individuals who gravitate towards intelligent, art house films. Yes Bill Murray does his deadpan schtick here: but it reveals the darker undertones that perhaps were always there.The DVD featurettes are good (you want more), particularly a conversation with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola. The deleted scenes include more from Anna Faris, who turns in an outstanding supporting performance as a young and ditzy actress turned loose in Tokyo, whose experience could not be more dissimilar to Murray and Johansson's.I consider this movie one of the best that I have seen over the past few years--and I see a lot of movies!",5,A beautiful dream,1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,2126,"['quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'film', 'plays', 'one', 'long', 'beautiful', 'dream', 'friendship', 'shared', 'experiences', 'alternate', 'universe.The', 'film', 'plot', 'simple', 'Two', 'Americans-a', 'mid-50', 'washed', 'up', 'actor', 'played', 'Bill', 'Murrray', 'young', 'married', 'Yale', 'graduate', 'played', 'Johansson-find', 'lost', 'Tokyo', 'week', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'lost', 'course', 'Murray', 'there', 'shoot', 'TV', 'commercial', 'Johansson', 'accompany', 'hip', 'photographer', 'husband', 'being', 'set', 'adrift', 'bright', 'lights', 'Tokyo', 'realize', 'how', 'lost', 'are', 'own', 'lives', 'Murray', 'character', 'going', 'classic', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'Johansson', 'character', 'undergoing', 'more', 'unusual', 'beginning', 'life', 'crisis.They', 'connect', 'hotel', 'bar', 'seeing', 'other', 'various', 'venues', 'Slowly', 'subtly', 'lovely', 'amazing', 'friendship', 'develops', 'are', 'same', 'stage', 'lives', 'emotionally', 'not', 'chronologically', 'beauty', 'movie', 'how', 'disparate', 'moment', 'time', 'two', 'souls', 'can', 'connect', 'emotional', 'not', 'physical', 'level.The', 'frenzy', 'Tokyo', 'day', 'night', 'life', 'powerful', 'counterpoint', 'slowly', 'unfolding', 'friendship', 'Coppola', 'amazing', 'eye', 'scenes', 'sights', 'tell', 'story', 'just', 'enough', 'neon', 'lights', 'just', 'enough', 'green', 'zen', 'gardens', 'make', 'feel', 'are', 'Tokyo.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'individuals', 'who', 'gravitate', 'towards', 'intelligent', 'art', 'house', 'films', 'Yes', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'deadpan', 'schtick', 'here', 'darker', 'perhaps', 'were', 'always', 'there.The', 'DVD', 'featurettes', 'are', 'good', 'want', 'more', 'particularly', 'conversation', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'more', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'who', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'performance', 'young', 'ditzy', 'actress', 'turned', 'loose', 'Tokyo', 'experience', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'dissimilar', 'Murray', ""Johansson's.I"", 'consider', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'see', 'lot', 'movies']",Lost in Translation

If it were a mindless screwball comedy it could be forgiven this flaw; however, the movie does appear to have the pretensions of communicating some sort of deeper meaning.  But the best moral of the story that I can come up with is:  people in strange foreign cultures, cut off from family, will bond together and make some bad choices until their return flights depart.  Hardly an earth shattering revelation.Bill Murray does give a fine performance, and has several opportunities to showcase his ironic wit, especially when filming a whiskey commercial.  The film also functions as an interesting Tokyo travelogue and an introduction to various aspects of Japanese popular culture, including the pachinko parlors, arcades, street youths, strip clubs, and Japanese television.  Bill Murray's visit to an over-the-top gaudy Japanese talk show is another one of the highlights.Unfortunately, the film's flaws outweigh the positives.  Besides lacking meaning, the plot takes several illogical turns.  Just when Bill Murray's character and the young married woman he meets appear on the verge of deepening their relationship, a much older floozy steals his affections for the night, which he instantly regrets.  This prevents the film from developing into a love story - it's a friend story, and one in which the friends aren't acting terribly rationally.  The young woman whom Bill Murray's character pursues is remarkably directionless; it's hard to believe that someone who graduated from Yale with a philosophy degree would be following her husband on a photo shoot assignment, listening to pop psychology motivational speakers, and crying over her experiences in a Japanese temple.  Some of the humor is more clich&eacute;d than funny, especially the ditzy blonde American actress.By contrast, Groundhog Day, which is a more mainstream film, was not only much funnier, but also had a message to communicate, about how one should conduct one's life.",2,Lost: the moral of the story,1066608000,"10 20, 2003",2003,2055,"['Lost', 'Translation', 'suffers', 'having', 'central', 'theme', 'moral', 'fundamental', 'message', 'communicate', 'were', 'mindless', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'flaw', 'however', 'movie', 'appear', 'have', 'pretensions', 'communicating', 'sort', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'best', 'moral', 'story', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'people', 'strange', 'foreign', 'cultures', 'cut', 'off', 'family', 'will', 'bond', 'together', 'make', 'bad', 'choices', 'return', 'flights', 'depart', 'Hardly', 'earth', 'shattering', 'revelation.Bill', 'Murray', 'give', 'fine', 'performance', 'several', 'opportunities', 'showcase', 'ironic', 'wit', 'especially', 'when', 'filming', 'whiskey', 'commercial', 'film', 'also', 'interesting', 'Tokyo', 'travelogue', 'introduction', 'various', 'aspects', 'Japanese', 'popular', 'culture', 'including', 'pachinko', 'parlors', 'arcades', 'street', 'youths', 'strip', 'clubs', 'Japanese', 'television', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'visit', 'over-the-top', 'gaudy', 'Japanese', 'talk', 'show', 'one', 'highlights.Unfortunately', 'film', 'flaws', 'outweigh', 'positives', 'lacking', 'meaning', 'plot', 'several', 'illogical', 'turns', 'Just', 'when', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'young', 'married', 'woman', 'appear', 'verge', 'deepening', 'relationship', 'much', 'older', 'floozy', 'steals', 'affections', 'night', 'instantly', 'film', 'developing', 'love', 'story', 'friend', 'story', 'one', 'friends', 'are', ""n't"", 'acting', 'terribly', 'rationally', 'young', 'woman', 'whom', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'pursues', 'remarkably', 'directionless', 'hard', 'believe', 'someone', 'who', 'graduated', 'Yale', 'philosophy', 'degree', 'would', 'be', 'following', 'husband', 'photo', 'shoot', 'assignment', 'listening', 'pop', 'psychology', 'motivational', 'speakers', 'crying', 'experiences', 'Japanese', 'temple', 'humor', 'more', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'funny', 'especially', 'ditzy', 'blonde', 'American', 'actress.By', 'contrast', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'more', 'mainstream', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'much', 'funnier', 'also', 'had', 'message', 'communicate', 'how', 'one', 'should', 'conduct', 'one', 'life']",Lost in Translation

Scarlett Johansson is very appealing as Charlotte, the neglected young wife of a photographer. The other star in this film is the city of Tokyo, whose surreal glitz pulses throughout the film and provides a thematic undercurrent.It is their alienation from this unreal foreign world that brings Murray and Johansson together in a friendship that approaches romance and ends in sad inevitability when the waning actor leaves Tokyo to return to his own deflated marriage, leaving Johansson to await the return of her insensitive, self-absorbed, preoccupied husband. A leitmotif is the two characters' feelings of emotional estrangement. They are ""lost"" not only because of language and culture barriers but in a deeper sense, their disillusionment with lives that seem to lack the richness they'd expected.The story is rather thin and the dialogue less than crackles. Charlotte doesn't get very many good lines and has to compensate with a good range of facial expression. Bill Murray's character tries to wax philosophical but it sounds clich&eacute;d, as when he tells Charlotte that once you have children ""Your life is never the same again."" Charlotte agonizes over her lack of direction: she tried writing but her self-evaluation of her work was that it was terrible (Harris later tells her somberly that she should keep writing).But director Sofia Coppola makes the most of the materials at hand, and this is a good film in spite of its defects.

619326,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B00005JMJ4,D. Allen,"[2, 5]","After watching Lost In Translation I could sum it up as a film about hope. The movie felt so great at the end and it just makes you want to laugh, cry, and perhaps jump for joy.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star together in what I would consider one of the best movie about loneliness and hopefulness. Bill Murray played a middle aged actor who is having a midlife crisis and then happen to meet a young, beautiful woman (Scarlett Johansson) who is just starting out with life and really just don't know what lies ahead. To say the least, the two of them are fairly lonely in their trip to Tokyo and question what lies ahead. Murray is on a business trip to make money from sponsors, but he has a wife at home who pays more attention to their children than him. Johansson plays a newly wed wife who is tagging along with her husband on a business trip. She isn't sure what lies ahead in the future of the two, and she is sort of depressed and feels isolated. Together, Johansson and Murray learn something together and both at the end realizes that life has a lot more to offer than what is in a relationship.I would say the best thing about Lost in Translation is the movie's setting. It is filmed on location in Tokyo, Japan. I never been to Japan, but I have been to Korea and I can relate to the feeling of isolation but as well as a part of the culture there. You can't understand what anyone is saying, nor can you understand the surrounding environment, and to top it off, anyone you happen to meet who speaks English can speak it very well but carrying out an actual decent conversation is next to impossible. I think Lost in Translation captured that very well.I think what makes this movie so special is the actors who played it out. Scarlett has a very special look to her that I think fit well for this movie. She has a sort of modern beauty to her, but at the same time, you can sort of sense that she is searching for something in life. Bill Murray usually plays an arrogant, stuck up character, but his role in this movie used that to its advantage but also brought about something human in him. You can almost feel a sense of loneliness, confusion, and sort of hopelessness out of his character as he is stuck in a midlife crisis.The movie ends in what I would consider thought provoking. [spoilers] At the end of the movie, Bill has to return home from Japan and Johansson is sort of sad to see him go, but doesn't really know what to say or how to say goodbye. So they sort of shook hands, said a quick goodbye, and parted. Still not feeling all that great, Bill is in his taxi when he sees Johansson walking amongst the crowd. He tells the driver to stop, and he walks up besides Johansson and they meet again both looking confused as to what to say. Bill then hugs Johansson, and he whispers something to her ear then parts. I think this is quite possibly the best part of the entire film. It sort of makes you wonder what Bill said to Johansson at the end, but at the same time it gives you a bit of hope and inspiration that even though you feel lonely now, and perhaps in what ever relationship you are in, that there is always hope and in that it sort of brings about your purpose, I think.

619327,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005JMJ4,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[2, 4]","Bob Harris (Bill Murry) is an american actor who is spending some time in Tokyo to shoot some whisky adds.  He doesn't want to be there.  But then again, you get the impression he doesn't want to be home either.  Bob is in what appears to be a loveless marriage, or at least a marriage falling out of love.  His wife, as he puts it, doesn't need him around anymore, and as she puts its, she's getting used to him never being around.  He's always away shooting movies or adds like this one.  Charlotte (Scarlott Johansson) is a twenty-five year old bride of two years whose photographer husband (Giovanni Rabisi) would rather spend time with an actress (Anna Farris) he seems to be smitten with.  Charlotte and Bob have a few things in common.  They are in Tokyo against their will and they pretty much hate the idea.  They are both in relationships not even strong enough to lean on and they are lost in themselves.  Charlotte doesn't know what she wants to do with her life and in a way Bob is in the same boat.  They form a relationship based on their similarities and they spend their time together hoping form karyokie bars and hot spots to cocktail bars and hotel rooms.  The movie revolves around getting to know these two lost souls.  Bill Murry does amazing here.  He's spot on displaying the feeling of being alone, being lonely and searching for hope in something, anything.  He's a great actor and portrays that wonderfully here.  He's funny and desprate all at the same time.  Scarlott, who I believe to be one of the most talented and beautiful young actresses around does unbelievable here and I agree with the millions who were pissed she didn't recieve an oscar nod.  She portrays the lovetorn wife, finding the attention she lacks from her mate in a man she barely knows but is drawn to for obvious reasons.

Meanwhile, don't miss the savvy sound track and fascinating glimpse of JapanWhat to eat while watching: Sake from one of those square, wooden cups. If you don't own one, you could make one from scrap two-by-fours. How hard could it be?Some people don't like it. For them it's not enough, somehow. Maybe it's too haphazard, too free from uproar and hysteria, too much like regular life. Maybe these are the people who feel that movies should be something far bigger than life--more like reality TV. For them, Lost in Translation is exactly that. That the Academy-Award-winning screenplay of Sofia Coppola hinges to some degree on an inaudible line might throw off viewers who like things to be simple and obvious.Your friend Gooden tends to get grouchy, however, when a writer or director holds my hand too much. I don't want to see a family reunited knowing that I'm expected to cry. I like when a story ends before all plot lines are drawn to a close, like the final scene in Laurel Canyon where the protagonist sinks into the swimming pool, questions unanswered, or Memento where you leave the theater unsure what happened or countless other examples.I like to reach the end of the film wondering about the characters in their world. Especially when I'm watching a DVD and I have time to look at the bonus features, which often adds fuel to my imagination's fire.Lost in Translation is very subtle. There are several transcendent moments that tie back into the title without elbowing you in the side. Coppola's other work The Virgin Suicides stands in contrast. That film was heavy handed in all regards with broadly stereotyped characters doing things that were as predictable as they were melodramatic.Obviously Coppola has matured as a writer. The uncanny Bill Murray shines as Bob Harris, an aging movie star well into the product-spokesperson phase of his career. He travels to Japan to film whiskey ads and finds himself sunk into deep loneliness. He does not like hobnobbing with the sundry Westerners who recognize him and around the Japanese majority in Japan, he is awkwardly blocked by linguistic and cultural barriers.In the same hotel is Charlotte (the fetching Scarlett Johansson), new wife of an up-and-coming young photographer. She's come with him to Japan because she's just earned her philosophy degree from Yale and doesn't know what else to do with herself. Note that Johansson is a transparent, or at least translucent, doppelganger for Coppola herself, a young woman, born to a leisurely life, trying to find herself. Such is the woman we saw at the awards petulantly fidgeting with her Oscar.Charlotte is clearly a brainy character. She takes herself by day into Japan to discover its mysteries and wonders. Nevertheless, she too is lonely with her husband gone most of the time. In a subtle moment, she glances at some polaroids of her husband and herself. In these photos, he is looking out of the picture at the camera, not at Charlotte. She notices this at a significant time, but the moment is simply what it is: no attention is called to the detail, and, in fact, the Mrs. didn't even notice it.Both Bob and Charlotte are plagued with insomnia, and they take to drinking in the hotel bar. It isn't long before they meet and, charming as they both are, they start to hang out. They drink together and eventually have a nighttime adventure when Charlotte goes to visit a Japanese friend from college and Bob tags along. The all-night party takes them from place to place in a dizzying montage of Japan's hip cultural circles. At last, the two fall asleep only to repeat the adventure the following night.The story sets up for a torrid love tryst between the young Charlotte and the mature Bob. In many movies, something explosive would have to occur, bringing sadness, regret, craziness, murder, or something to grip the ""gimme-it-straight"" type of audience member. But this isn't most movies. Both characters have their marriages, challenges and all, and Bob deftly sublimates the sexual tension.The friendship, therefore, is very touching. The two teach one another very lovely and ephemeral lessons. I call this movie a classic because it has a sense of innocence and simplicity that I associate with golden-era films. There's an earnest attempt to portray several characters, two in the middle, with all their foibles. It's a film like this that one can enjoy like a good book. It can envelope you and change you with a soft touch. I look forward to Coppola's next work.",5,A classic love story and a trip to Japan!,1078358400,"03 4, 2004",2004,4568,"['What', 'do', 'watching', 'Try', 'guess', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Meanwhile', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'savvy', 'sound', 'track', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'JapanWhat', 'eat', 'watching', 'Sake', 'one', 'square', 'wooden', 'cups', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'one', 'scrap', 'two-by-fours', 'How', 'hard', 'could', 'be', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'not', 'enough', 'somehow', 'Maybe', 'too', 'haphazard', 'too', 'free', 'uproar', 'hysteria', 'too', 'much', 'regular', 'life', 'Maybe', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'something', 'far', 'bigger', 'life', 'more', 'reality', 'TV', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'exactly', 'Academy-Award-winning', 'screenplay', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'degree', 'inaudible', 'line', 'might', 'throw', 'off', 'viewers', 'who', 'like', 'things', 'be', 'simple', 'obvious.Your', 'friend', 'Gooden', 'get', 'grouchy', 'however', 'when', 'writer', 'director', 'hand', 'too', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'family', 'reunited', 'knowing', ""'m"", 'expected', 'cry', 'like', 'when', 'story', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'drawn', 'close', 'final', 'scene', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'where', 'protagonist', 'swimming', 'pool', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'Memento', 'where', 'leave', 'theater', 'unsure', 'what', 'happened', 'countless', 'other', 'examples.I', 'reach', 'end', 'film', 'wondering', 'characters', 'world', 'Especially', 'when', ""'m"", 'watching', 'DVD', 'have', 'time', 'look', 'bonus', 'features', 'often', 'fuel', 'imagination', 'fire.Lost', 'Translation', 'very', 'subtle', 'are', 'several', 'transcendent', 'moments', 'tie', 'back', 'title', 'elbowing', 'side', 'Coppola', 'other', 'work', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'contrast', 'film', 'was', 'heavy', 'handed', 'regards', 'broadly', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'doing', 'things', 'were', 'as', 'predictable', 'were', 'melodramatic.Obviously', 'Coppola', 'matured', 'writer', 'uncanny', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'shines', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'aging', 'movie', 'star', 'well', 'product-spokesperson', 'phase', 'career', 'Japan', 'film', 'whiskey', 'ads', 'sunk', 'deep', 'loneliness', 'not', 'hobnobbing', 'sundry', 'Westerners', 'who', 'recognize', 'Japanese', 'majority', 'Japan', 'awkwardly', 'blocked', 'linguistic', 'cultural', 'barriers.In', 'same', 'hotel', 'Charlotte', 'fetching', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'new', 'wife', 'up-and-coming', 'young', 'photographer', 'come', 'Japan', 'just', 'earned', 'philosophy', 'degree', 'Yale', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'Note', 'Johansson', 'transparent', 'least', 'translucent', 'doppelganger', 'Coppola', 'young', 'woman', 'born', 'leisurely', 'life', 'trying', 'find', 'Such', 'woman', 'saw', 'awards', 'petulantly', 'fidgeting', 'Oscar.Charlotte', 'clearly', 'brainy', 'character', 'day', 'Japan', 'discover', 'mysteries', 'wonders', 'Nevertheless', 'too', 'lonely', 'husband', 'gone', 'most', 'time', 'subtle', 'moment', 'polaroids', 'husband', 'photos', 'looking', 'picture', 'camera', 'not', 'Charlotte', 'significant', 'time', 'moment', 'simply', 'what', 'attention', 'called', 'detail', 'fact', 'Mrs.', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'plagued', 'insomnia', 'take', 'drinking', 'hotel', 'bar', ""n't"", 'long', 'meet', 'charming', 'are', 'start', 'hang', 'out', 'drink', 'together', 'eventually', 'have', 'nighttime', 'adventure', 'when', 'Charlotte', 'visit', 'Japanese', 'friend', 'college', 'Bob', 'tags', 'along', 'all-night', 'party', 'place', 'place', 'dizzying', 'montage', 'Japan', 'hip', 'cultural', 'circles', 'last', 'two', 'fall', 'only', 'repeat', 'adventure', 'following', 'night.The', 'story', 'up', 'torrid', 'love', 'tryst', 'young', 'Charlotte', 'mature', 'Bob', 'many', 'movies', 'something', 'explosive', 'would', 'have', 'occur', 'bringing', 'sadness', 'regret', 'craziness', 'murder', 'something', 'grip', 'gim', '-it-straight', 'type', 'audience', 'member', ""n't"", 'most', 'movies', 'characters', 'have', 'marriages', 'challenges', 'Bob', 'deftly', 'sexual', 'tension.The', 'friendship', 'therefore', 'very', 'touching', 'two', 'teach', 'one', 'very', 'lovely', 'ephemeral', 'lessons', 'call', 'movie', 'classic', 'sense', 'innocence', 'simplicity', 'associate', 'golden-era', 'films', 'earnest', 'attempt', 'portray', 'several', 'characters', 'two', 'middle', 'foibles', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'enjoy', 'good', 'book', 'can', 'envelope', 'change', 'soft', 'touch', 'look', 'forward', 'Coppola', 'next', 'work']",Lost in Translation

It's filled with so many small, beautiful, moments like when Johansson takes the bullet train to Kyoto and wanders around templea and witnesses a traditional wedding that touches her and redeems Japanese culture in her heart.And this movie is hilarious, even more so if you know how true-to-life all the bizarre and hillarious cultural items are: from the garrish fey talk show, to all-night karaoke, to bizarre sex clubs, to the fact that there's a telephone in the bathroom.So if you saw it in the theatre - check it out again.

619333,A1PLRDMBCSULMI,B00005JMJ4,Daniel Ferrisi,"[1, 1]","Lost in Translation has been praised by countless critics as the singular indie gem of 2003. Personally, I found House of Sand and Fog and Monster to be far more compelling viewing, yet I cannot criticize reviewers who lavished this film with four-star reviews and glowing rhetoric. This is an original piece of work, with a decided air of wisdom, that simply didn't connect with me deeply at any point. Director Sofia Coppola provides several long silences for what one can only assume is viewer introspection. Judging from the film's enthusiastic following, Lost translated art into life quite well.For me, I sympathized with the characters more than I empathized with them. I was unable to find an ""in"" to become emotionally engaged in the plot. The characters were recognizable, but difficult for me to identify with. For that reason, I felt detached--like a viewer of rather than party to the experience--for the length of the film. Instead of wise, the film felt wispy. It was entertaining while it ran, but once the credits rolled, it immediately began its rapid fade into the nether-regions of my memory.But, despite these screenplay issues, the acting and direction absolutely stand out as among the best work in recent memory. If the material had been stronger, this potent combination probably would have churned out a film truly deserving of Best Picture consideration. Bill Murray gives his best screen performance ever as Bob Harris, a B-list American movie star who is shipped off to Japan for a big money liquor endorsement. Away from his family and home country, Harris feels the pangs of isolation and depression. The sporadic calls to his wife reveal a woman who is distant, and a relationship that has long since fizzled.Harris can't sleep a wink, and spends a great deal of time in the hotel bar, where he meets young newlywed Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Charlotte, a recent college graduate with a degree in philosophy, is married to a photographer with seemingly no interest in her; he prefers to hang out with the ditzy airheads he shoots. Both with equal desperation to escape their surroundings, Bob and Charlotte strike an unexpected and deep friendship. We believe they are soul mates, yet the circumstances are damning. Can they drop everything that's become so achingly familiar and try to start their lives over again, perhaps more along the lines of what they had hoped they'd always be?As good as Murray is, and he is absolutely terrific, Johansson taps into a wonderful intangible that makes her presence on the screen thoroughly intoxicating. She shares palpable chemistry with the much-older Murray, making the bond between them feel all the more genuine. Director Coppola takes full advantage of this, with inventive visuals and direction that is so sure-handed it comes as a shock Lost is her sophomore feature effort. There are literally a dozen different lingering shots that could easily work as effective poster images.For all those reasons, it is frustrating the film itself isn't stronger as an end product. Even the beginning, with several big laughs, just leads to a bit of a letdown when comedic momentum runs out in the third act. But, despite numerous imperfections, any Oscar buzz on the film is much appreciated.

619334,A3A7CBLO6JGY4F,B00005JMJ4,"Daniel Garris ""YoSoyTylerDurden""","[0, 0]","As far as more recent films go, Lost in Translation sparks a love/hate relationship for me like no other.  Overall, I find the film rather enjoyable, but at the same time there is this duel nature surrounding it that I find to be both admirable and disdainable.For me this duel nature lies at the heart of the task undertaken by Sofia Coppola.  On one hand the film is clearly something along the lines of the works of Godard, Antonioni and Kar Wai, a notion which Coppola herself didn't hide in her Oscar night acceptance speech.  And on the other hand, we also have the Hollywoodized (albeit Hollywood laced with the indie-spirit) nature of the film that is also very apparent throughout.  The characters, while often different from the norm, still have very stereotypical qualities, the overall image presented of Japan feels very Hollywoodized, and on top of it all there is the dry humor of Bill Murray.  What we are essentially presented with is a film that is both a detached/modernest/post-modernist/art house work along the lines of the earlier mentioned artists and an ""outside, yet still inside of Hollywood"" Hollywood film.As a fan of the filmmakers she has been inspired by, I have a deep respect for Coppola in bringing forth that type of filmmaking to a mainstream audience.  Yet, with regard to the film's artistic merits, there is also a real problem in Hollywoodizing a style of filmmaking that at its essence is anti-Hollywood.  By making the film relatively mainstream, it can also be seen as going against the type of filmmaking it admires.  But to be fair, this same argument can be made against any film trying to blur the lines of Art cinema and Mainstream fare.  The difference with Lost in Translation (compared to say Punch-Drunk Love), is that Lost in Translation is SO influenced by such past works that it is impossible not to notice (for anyone familiar with such works going in) the mainstream/art cinema clash.  Instead of having its own voice that references such past works along the way, the film ultimately becomes a distortion of what has come before it.  Pop in In the Mood For Love,  L' Avventura or My Life to Live after watching Lost in Translation, and you'll get the point.Again, although I'm rather critical about the overall nature of the film, I still find it very enjoyable.  It is a great exercise in creating a mood of detachment.  The main characters are detached from their lives, their surroundings and ultimately one another.  The wonderful cinematography also plays a big role here, as the camera positioning helps further the mood of detachment a number of times throughout the film.  And then obviously, there are the fabulous performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  At the end of the day the film has all the ingredients of a great work, but still seems to be missing that extra-something to make it truly special.The film serves as a nice addition to the growing trend of films on the fringe of Hollywood that play on the traditional expectations of romantic comedies and romance in Hollywood film in general, right alongside Punch Drunk-Love and the recent Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.*** 1/2, (8.0/10)",4,My love/hate relationship with Lost in Translation,1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,3185,"['As', 'far', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'go', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'other', 'Overall', 'find', 'film', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'same', 'time', 'duel', 'nature', 'surrounding', 'find', 'be', 'admirable', 'disdainable.For', 'duel', 'nature', 'heart', 'task', 'undertaken', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'one', 'hand', 'film', 'clearly', 'something', 'lines', 'works', 'Godard', 'Antonioni', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'notion', 'Coppola', 'did', ""n't"", 'hide', 'Oscar', 'night', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'have', 'Hollywoodized', 'Hollywood', 'laced', 'indie-spirit', 'nature', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'apparent', 'characters', 'often', 'different', 'norm', 'still', 'have', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'qualities', 'overall', 'image', 'presented', 'Japan', 'feels', 'very', 'Hollywoodized', 'top', 'dry', 'humor', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'What', 'are', 'essentially', 'presented', 'film', 'detached/modernest/post-modernist/art', 'house', 'work', 'lines', 'earlier', 'mentioned', 'artists', 'outside', 'yet', 'still', 'Hollywood', 'Hollywood', 'film.As', 'fan', 'filmmakers', 'been', 'inspired', 'have', 'deep', 'respect', 'Coppola', 'bringing', 'forth', 'type', 'filmmaking', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'regard', 'film', 'artistic', 'merits', 'also', 'real', 'problem', 'Hollywoodizing', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'essence', 'anti-Hollywood', 'making', 'film', 'relatively', 'mainstream', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'going', 'type', 'filmmaking', 'be', 'fair', 'same', 'argument', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'trying', 'blur', 'lines', 'Art', 'cinema', 'Mainstream', 'fare', 'difference', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'compared', 'say', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'SO', 'influenced', 'such', 'past', 'works', 'impossible', 'not', 'notice', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'such', 'works', 'going', 'mainstream/art', 'cinema', 'clash', 'Instead', 'having', 'own', 'voice', 'references', 'such', 'past', 'works', 'way', 'film', 'ultimately', 'distortion', 'what', 'come', 'Pop', 'Mood', 'Love', 'L', 'Avventura', 'Life', 'Live', 'watching', 'Lost', 'Translation', ""'ll"", 'get', 'point.Again', ""'m"", 'rather', 'critical', 'overall', 'nature', 'film', 'still', 'find', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'exercise', 'creating', 'mood', 'detachment', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'detached', 'lives', 'surroundings', 'ultimately', 'one', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'also', 'big', 'role', 'here', 'camera', 'positioning', 'further', 'mood', 'detachment', 'number', 'times', 'film', 'then', 'obviously', 'are', 'fabulous', 'performances', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'ingredients', 'great', 'work', 'still', 'be', 'missing', 'extra-something', 'make', 'truly', 'special.The', 'film', 'serves', 'nice', 'addition', 'growing', 'trend', 'films', 'fringe', 'Hollywood', 'play', 'traditional', 'expectations', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'romance', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'general', 'right', 'alongside', 'Punch', 'Drunk-Love', 'recent', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', '1/2', '8.0/10']",Lost in Translation

619338,A3KV7FISWAW06A,B00005JMJ4,Dansa,"[7, 8]","""Lost in Translation"" is a dreamy, mellow film that relies almost exclusively on visuals and music to get it's points across. The minimal dialouge sprinkled throughout is rarely as important as the images unfolding on the screen. The pace moves at a gloomy crawl, a few instances of tasteful comedy keeping the mood from becoming too heavy(it should be noted that Billy is mostly poking fun at himself, not the Japanese people.)  The two main characters are kept apart for most of film, with Sophia wisely choosing to dwell on them when their alone both literally and metaphorically; this intrusion of their privacy allowing the viewer to really submerge themselves in the characters'lives for better or for worst. As Bob and Charlotte cross paths more and more fequently the movie builds with understated urgency, until the film springs to life midway through when they finally come together for a night on the town in a fast paced sequence of fun colorful adventures.The film is never this lively or hopeful again, as the final moments gradually develop a painful almost dread quality to them as Bob and Charlotte are faced with the realization that this retreat from their misery can't last forever.  Oddly enough, the moving conclusion ends up being a bittersweet triumph, hinting at a new found strength in the characters.  Sophia  makes good use of both the actors and the beautiful urban setting while showing an excellent understanding for almost pure visual storytelling.  Tokyo simply looks beautiful as she allows the camera to drone on the lovely details of the city and it's citizens; mostly through the eyes of an aimlessly wandering Charlotte. After watching the film, one feels as if they know the city and the hotel as well as the characters.  However, it's really the performances that carry the film.Bill and Scarlett prove to be more than up to the task of almost wordless acting.  Though his weathered face is mostly somber and blank, Bill's soulful eyes stare with a profound unrest and longing, the slightest gesture conveying pages of depth and emotion that probably wasn't in the script. A very mature Scarlett does much of her acting with subtle looks of vaguely masked dis-satisfaction and desperate unrest; often appearing to be completely helpless and vunerable to the depression she's sunk into.  Her and Bill's characters might as well be the same age as both seem to be feeling the same thing.  When they do interact, the scenes are filled with incredibly sincere subtle gestures that reflect warm fondness and understanding if not an all out unspoken attraction. It's this geniune warmth that makes the film so romantic and the earlier melancholy all the more worthwhile.  In his small role, Ribisi is also enjoyable as Scarlett's well meaning but clueless husband. Some find it difficult to empathize with the characters and the irony of their situation(apparently rich and depressed), yet anyone who's ever felt alone(see: everybody) should not have trouble relating.DVD Notes-A short featurette with Sophia and Bill is the most useful and watchable. There is sadly no commentary, and the deleted scenes add nothing, while the Music Video is kind of meh. The menu screen is beautiful however.",5,"""Words are very unnecessary.""",1171411200,"02 14, 2007",2007,3227,"['Lost', 'Translation', 'dreamy', 'mellow', 'film', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'visuals', 'music', 'get', 'points', 'minimal', 'dialouge', 'sprinkled', 'rarely', 'as', 'important', 'images', 'unfolding', 'screen', 'pace', 'gloomy', 'crawl', 'few', 'instances', 'tasteful', 'comedy', 'keeping', 'mood', 'becoming', 'too', 'heavy', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Billy', 'mostly', 'poking', 'fun', 'not', 'Japanese', 'people', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'kept', 'apart', 'most', 'film', 'Sophia', 'wisely', 'choosing', 'dwell', 'when', 'alone', 'literally', 'metaphorically', 'intrusion', 'privacy', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'really', 'submerge', ""characters'lives"", 'better', 'worst', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'cross', 'paths', 'more', 'more', 'fequently', 'movie', 'understated', 'urgency', 'film', 'springs', 'life', 'midway', 'when', 'finally', 'come', 'together', 'night', 'town', 'fast', 'paced', 'sequence', 'fun', 'colorful', 'adventures.The', 'film', 'never', 'lively', 'hopeful', 'again', 'final', 'moments', 'gradually', 'develop', 'painful', 'almost', 'dread', 'quality', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'faced', 'realization', 'retreat', 'misery', 'ca', ""n't"", 'last', 'forever', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'moving', 'conclusion', 'up', 'being', 'bittersweet', 'triumph', 'hinting', 'new', 'found', 'strength', 'characters', 'Sophia', 'good', 'use', 'actors', 'beautiful', 'urban', 'setting', 'showing', 'excellent', 'understanding', 'almost', 'pure', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'Tokyo', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'camera', 'drone', 'lovely', 'details', 'city', 'citizens', 'mostly', 'eyes', 'aimlessly', 'wandering', 'Charlotte', 'watching', 'film', 'one', 'feels', 'know', 'city', 'hotel', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'However', 'really', 'performances', 'carry', 'film.Bill', 'Scarlett', 'prove', 'be', 'more', 'up', 'task', 'almost', 'wordless', 'acting', 'weathered', 'face', 'mostly', 'somber', 'blank', 'Bill', 'soulful', 'eyes', 'stare', 'profound', 'unrest', 'longing', 'slightest', 'gesture', 'conveying', 'pages', 'depth', 'emotion', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'script', 'very', 'mature', 'Scarlett', 'much', 'acting', 'subtle', 'looks', 'vaguely', 'masked', 'dis-satisfaction', 'desperate', 'unrest', 'often', 'appearing', 'be', 'completely', 'helpless', 'vunerable', 'depression', 'sunk', 'Bill', 'characters', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'same', 'age', 'seem', 'be', 'feeling', 'same', 'thing', 'When', 'do', 'interact', 'scenes', 'are', 'filled', 'incredibly', 'sincere', 'subtle', 'gestures', 'reflect', 'warm', 'fondness', 'understanding', 'not', 'out', 'unspoken', 'attraction', 'geniune', 'film', 'so', 'romantic', 'earlier', 'melancholy', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'small', 'role', 'Ribisi', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'Scarlett', 'well', 'meaning', 'clueless', 'husband', 'find', 'difficult', 'empathize', 'characters', 'irony', 'situation', 'apparently', 'rich', 'depressed', 'yet', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'felt', 'alone', 'see', 'everybody', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'trouble', 'relating.DVD', 'Notes-A', 'short', 'featurette', 'Sophia', 'Bill', 'most', 'useful', 'watchable', 'sadly', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'add', 'nothing', 'Music', 'Video', 'kind', 'meh', 'menu', 'screen', 'beautiful', 'however']",Lost in Translation

(That was my teenage daughter's epithet for this movie).A sense of loneliness and being unstuck in time pervades the mood throughout this movie, probably another real downer for people looking for something uplifting to watch. Although the movie is about a relationship between a man and a woman, this relationship fails to follow the standard Hollywood romantic plotlines - a conventional boy-meets-girl love story or ""chick flick"" this DEFINITELY is not (and believe me, I have been dragged to enough of these). As many women seem to have written in saying that they hated this movie as loved it.And so, none of the basic formulas of the standard modern day Hollywood movie are present.Why do people like the movie? I think, first and foremost, the two characters of Bob and Charlotte and their situation have to appeal to you. One has to be able to have an understanding and empathy for their sense of loneliness and being unstuck in time, and also be able to share in their mutual joy at finding each other and being able to share in this brief friendship while traveling in a strange land. One also has to be able to understand their mutual respect for each other's boundaries, and not wanting to mess up each other's lives while together for such a brief period of time, in order to be able to appreciate, rather than disdain, the fact that they do not start having sex with each other, like so many conventional movie plotlines.Yes, coming from somebody who's favorite other movie is Conan the Barbarian (read my review!), you might wonder what the common thread is between the two movies. Well, there is none.  Despite being a very direct, goal oriented, and driven person, and despite being a great fan of the usual Hollywood fantasy- sci-fi -action adventure CGI superhero movies, I also have wonderful memories of many friendships with women, none of whom were or became my girlfriends or lovers. And so watching this movie brings on an intense feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu; I can almost see the movie and relate to it with my eyes closed.I would disagree with those who say that this movie was about finding your soulmate. I never got the feeling from this movie that Bob and Charlotte were 100% compatible, that they were engaged in a mind-meld, that they came to understand each other's psyche so well that they fit together like spoons, or that they had this burning desire to abandon their spouses and spend the rest of their lives together. No, this movie was just about two people who, by chance, had an opportunity to step out of the rigid mold of their regular lives and really enjoy each other's company for a brief moment in time. And then, through the same set of circumstances, they are parted again. They are together so briefly that they never get to know each other well enough to find out whether they would have made it as a long term couple. And that is what is so poignant and wistful about the ending of this movie - the sense of wishing for more, the sense of what if. But then again, better to not ruin this beautiful friendship by having sex and trying to live together.I was fascinated by the interaction of Japanese and Americans in this movie; some people thought this was a racist movie, with so much making fun of the Japanese habit of getting r's and l's mixed up when speaking English. Well, there was a lot more subtle cultural stuff going on than just the language problem in this movie. In the context of the whole movie, I did not think that the language problem was overblown - this really is just how most native Japanese mash up English (just like Americans mash up other cultures' languages). Most native Japanese, I think, have enough confidence in the strength of their own culture to not feel embarrassed about this, just like Americans don't feel embarrassed when speaking another language badly. This movie was filmed, after all, in Japan, with a large number of Japanese working in the crew and cast of the movie. The reviewers who thought this movie was racist all seemed to be from outside of Japan (I haven't found one that came from Japan yet, and in fact, Sofia Coppola seems to be rather admired in Japan), and, I think these reviewers mainly have individual  problems with white American cultural hegemony and insensitivity rather than what is actually in this movie.Bill Murray is terrific in the role of Bob Harris. This is a mature actor in his prime, not the cynical jokester Bill Murray of old. I was a bit surprised by Scarlett Johansson. Her acting is terrific. With all the hype in the news media about Johansson's beauty, Sofia Coppola's natural, unvarnished portrayal of her in this movie was the surprising part. Very little make-up, revealing the small moles on her face, and in some close-up scenes the natural color of the roots of her hair. Some unkind people have written reviews mentioning a fat butt, but this is only if you like anorexic women, I suppose. Johannson is a lot shorter than I had thought, but well along the lines of, shall we say, a classical beauty, like Botticelli's Venus.The movie ends beautifully. Bob is set to return to America. He really wants to say good-bye to Charlotte, but is thwarted twice, first when she is not in her hotel room when he calls, and then again when Charlotte catches up to him as he is leaving the hotel. By then, Bob is surrounded by his Japanese hosts and you can see how their presence suddenly throws up an unbreachable wall between him and Charlotte. Watch their faces in this scene, you can see the tension, and then the pain in Bob's eyes, and the look of slight hurt and puzzlement, and then finally detachment, in Charlotte's face, as Bob gives Charlotte only the most cursory of cool good-byes while his hosts look on intently.I'll stop here, since I don't want to completely give away the ending of the movie, or get this review dropped by Amazon.com again. The final scene as Bob finds Charlotte again on his way to the airport is a terrifically poignant ending, full of mystery and an unspoken loss and wistfulness that comes only from the parting of a great friendship between a man and a woman.In our modern day world, fast-paced, and incredibly mobile and transient, such passing friendships happen altogether more commonly; few of these friendships lead to the sort of romances written into Hollywood movies of today. ""Lost in Translation"" is that rare movie which addresses this theme from every day life realistically, faithfully, and poignantly.",5,Sweetly poignant and wistful tale of a passing

619342,AVV1ACH67XI85,B00005JMJ4,"Davalon ""Davalon""","[3, 4]","NOTE: Includes spoilers.All I heard about for months from my American friends was ""Lost in Translation.""  As I live in Japan and actually played piano at the Park Hyatt in the New York Bar & Grill for several years, I finally broke down and bought the DVD. I was expecting to see something wildly different, not to mention gut-bustingly funny, based on the clever trailers.I must honestly say that I almost turned off the film twice - especially during the karaoke sequence. As Sofia Coppola said herself, it was basically like a little ""home movie.""  She went to the places she liked, she had the ""characters"" (I use that word loosely) at the hotel she liked, and she kind of followed them around as they floundered about in Tokyo.There were distinct moments when I thought Bill Murray (whom I love) was ad-libbing the scenes.  Also, as others have pointed out, there really isn't a plot.  Things just kind of unfold, and I too, felt the actors were just ""real"" people -- not really acting, just standing in front of a camera and making it up as they went along.And yet... by the time the film got to the last minute, I felt something incredibly deep and sad.  I felt like the two leads had each found the right person and yet they would still be going back to the wrong lives.  It was very powerful, and despite the adlib feel of the entire film, when it came to the end, both the actors conveyed the emotion beautifully (something two ""real"" people off the street could not do).Scarlett Johansson was so beautiful that it was worth watching the film just to look at her -- although I feel the opening shot was absolutely pointless and my first thought was ""Is Sofia a lesbian?""  I didn't get it at all.The cinematography was great, and living here in Tokyo, I know how hard it was to get some of those incredible shots.As far as the film being ""racist"" -- the only moment that I felt uncomfortable with was at the sushi restaurant.  It seemed like a weak, stupid joke, and the comment about the ""r's"" and ""l's"" was dumb as well -- but, hello, people -- this is how some people think and talk, especially those who have absolutely no understanding about Japan (like the Olsen twins, who said their only Japanese reference was ""Lost in Translation"" -- open a book, girls!).One thing that people who rave about this film might consider doing is turning on the English subtitles.  They might be shocked at some of the inexplicable lyrics in the final song.  I don't know what Sofia was thinking, or if she was thinking at all.  She probably just liked the song.  I can't imagine she listened carefully to the words.At any rate, if you don't mind taking a sort of ambling roundabout, strange and lazy journey through Tokyo for a couple of hours, you should (if you feel anything at all) be struck at how the last moment comes up and grabs you and makes you realize that maybe there is a right person in this world for each of us, but we may not realize it until it's too late -- or, even worse, may not make the effort to change our worlds to be with that person.",3,The last minute,1084406400,"05 13, 2004",2004,3061,"['NOTE', 'spoilers.All', 'heard', 'months', 'American', 'friends', 'was', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'live', 'Japan', 'actually', 'played', 'piano', 'Park', 'Hyatt', 'New', 'York', 'Bar', 'Grill', 'several', 'years', 'finally', 'broke', 'down', 'bought', 'DVD', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'something', 'wildly', 'different', 'not', 'mention', 'gut-bustingly', 'funny', 'based', 'clever', 'trailers.I', 'must', 'honestly', 'say', 'almost', 'turned', 'off', 'film', 'twice', 'especially', 'karaoke', 'sequence', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'said', 'was', 'basically', 'little', 'home', 'movie', 'went', 'places', 'liked', 'had', 'characters', 'use', 'word', 'loosely', 'hotel', 'liked', 'kind', 'followed', 'around', 'floundered', 'Tokyo.There', 'were', 'distinct', 'moments', 'when', 'thought', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'whom', 'love', 'was', 'ad-libbing', 'scenes', 'Also', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'really', ""n't"", 'plot', 'Things', 'just', 'kind', 'unfold', 'too', 'felt', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'really', 'acting', 'just', 'standing', 'front', 'camera', 'making', 'up', 'went', 'along.And', 'yet', 'time', 'film', 'got', 'last', 'minute', 'felt', 'something', 'incredibly', 'deep', 'sad', 'felt', 'two', 'leads', 'had', 'found', 'right', 'person', 'yet', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'going', 'back', 'wrong', 'lives', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'adlib', 'feel', 'entire', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'end', 'actors', 'conveyed', 'emotion', 'beautifully', 'something', 'two', 'real', 'people', 'street', 'could', 'not', 'do', '.Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'film', 'just', 'look', 'feel', 'opening', 'shot', 'was', 'absolutely', 'pointless', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'Sofia', 'lesbian', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'all.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'great', 'living', 'here', 'Tokyo', 'know', 'how', 'hard', 'was', 'get', 'incredible', 'shots.As', 'far', 'film', 'being', 'racist', 'only', 'moment', 'felt', 'uncomfortable', 'was', 'sushi', 'restaurant', 'seemed', 'weak', 'stupid', 'joke', 'comment', 'r', 'l', 'was', 'dumb', 'as', 'well', 'hello', 'people', 'how', 'people', 'think', 'talk', 'especially', 'who', 'have', 'absolutely', 'understanding', 'Japan', 'Olsen', 'twins', 'who', 'said', 'only', 'Japanese', 'reference', 'was', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'open', 'book', 'girls', '.One', 'thing', 'people', 'who', 'rave', 'film', 'might', 'consider', 'doing', 'turning', 'English', 'subtitles', 'might', 'be', 'shocked', 'inexplicable', 'lyrics', 'final', 'song', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Sofia', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'thinking', 'probably', 'just', 'liked', 'song', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'listened', 'carefully', 'words.At', 'rate', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'taking', 'sort', 'ambling', 'roundabout', 'strange', 'lazy', 'journey', 'Tokyo', 'couple', 'hours', 'should', 'feel', 'anything', 'be', 'struck', 'how', 'last', 'moment', 'up', 'grabs', 'realize', 'maybe', 'right', 'person', 'world', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'too', 'late', 'even', 'worse', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'effort', 'change', 'worlds', 'be', 'person']",Lost in Translation

There are couple decent scenes, but it moves along very slowly at times. You have one character going though a midlife crisis and another with maybe a little neglectful husband. Both characters just seem to be bored with their lives and the only thing that makes this movie half interesting is they are in a different setting being in Japan. Sofia Coppola deserves some credit for shooting this in less than a month and writng the screenplay for a young director, but those things shouldn't come into play when juding how good a film really is. Scarlett Johansson looks good on screen and has a nice presence, but that could be just all those underwear shots they had in the movie.

619344,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B00005JMJ4,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[1, 1]","Have you ever sat through a movie that is really good, has a compelling story, great characters, and yet still felt a little cold?  I mean you really liked the movie, it made you think, it didn't play down to you, and yet you were hoping for little bit more?  Sophia Coppola's new film LOST IN TRANSLATION, is a good movie with a great movie caught inside it.TRANSLATION stars Bill Murray (Groundhog Day) as Bob Harris, a former hotshot action star at the end of his career.  His marriage may be falling apart, his life is coming unraveled, and he's just been offered two million dollars to hawk an alcoholic beverage in Japan.  Life seems to be getting worse until he strikes up a relationship with an unlikely friend.Her name is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, The Man Who Wasn&#65533;t There) and she just so happens to be in the same boat.  Her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi, The Other Sister) is living a dream and ignoring her.  She's alone in a city of millions.TRANSLATION is so rich with ideas.  Here you're presented with two people who are alone forced to cling to each other for lack of anyone else.  In America would these two friends ever find each other?  Probably not, but here they are strangers in a strange land and all that makes a difference.Bill Murray once again takes the smart road and distances himself from the films that made him a star.  He plays a character of such stunning vulnerability and yet silly charm.  I loved how he disappears into a scene.  You forget you&#65533;re looking at the guy from MEATBALLS.  I sometimes miss the silly and crazy actor he once was, but at least when he turns in a dramatic performance it's well worth watching.Johansson should also be congratulated for her fine performance.  I liked her understated charm and silly little smile.  The camera loves to linger on her because she&#65533;s got this unique screen presence.  Of course she's beautiful, but not as a typical actress is beautiful.  She's beautiful like that girl in you're high school homeroom is beautiful, or that random women on the street is beautiful.  Johansson can exist in the real world.  She's average and yet mysterious, cute and yet understated.All that aside the biggest problem with the movie is that much of the plot is half realized.  To make up for this Coppola trains her camera on Johansson as she a stare out windows, lays in bed, takes walk around Tokyo and then stares out the widow again.  A little of this is okay; it even worked sometimes.  I gave us a look inside her head.  But after we've figured out that she's lonely we keep watching her look out windows, and walk around.  It was too much and prolonged the meat of the movie, the relationship between her and Bob.To the films credit there is a great sequence in which Bob and Charlotte are laying together in a bed.  You can tell they have a connection that sparks are flying, in a Hollywood movie this is the point that they'd begin to kiss.  But in this film Bob does something far more interesting he just touches her foot.  In real life you have to face the ones you love in the morning, Best not throw it all away on a person you hardly know.TRANSLATION is about what connects people.  Is it a love story?

It deservingly garnered three Golden Globe wins (Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay) and four Oscar nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Original Screenplay).  Its plot of an American actor popular in the 1970's who finds peace in Japan is brilliant and original.  The emotional aspects are heavily present, namely Bob Harris (Murray) being away from his family and Charlotte (Johansson) becoming increasingly lonely due to her husband not being present often.  The combination of the two storylines come together smoothly, especially when the two characters become soulmates.  The dramatic aspects keep audience interested in every moment.  Such movie quality marks director Sofia Coppola at her career best so far.  Bill Murray marks a triumphant comeback in this movie.  Though well known as a comedian, he shines in this dramatic role.  No other actor could have performed his role better.  Scarlett Johansson marks a brilliant career launcher in her role.  She proves that she'll continue becomine well-known as a wonderful actress in the future.  &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; is great for those looking for an original drama.

After seeing this motion picture, it becomes apparent that there are traces of the ""former"" Bill Murray present in the above former scenario. Middle-aged actor Bob Harris (Murray) is in Tokyo to shoot a series of commercials for a whiskey company, and, at the same time, wonders to himself: ""Who am I, and what am I doing in ""The Land of the Rising Sun?"". In answering the first question, Mr. Harris, you're a fifty-something individual who's eager to find out what life will continue to have in store for you, and whether or not you'll continue to have a career based on doing only B-rated TV commercials. In answering that all-important second question, Bob, your company sent you to Japan, because they simply said so, as well as to experience a new and different world on a social-cultural level. Like it or not, it is also a test of love and fidelity, when Harris meets up with a twenty-something female (Scarlett Johansson) just a few years out of college, who's in Tokyo to experience how the other half of the cultural spectrum lives, as well as to find herself, so to speak. Here, Bill Murray proves to be the master craftsman, as his suave demeanor and charasmatic wit carries him through the film without any traceable snags or bumps, as he wins the hearts of the local Japanese faithful, regardless of the fact his character doesn't understand neither the national customs nor the language, for all concerned.

619353,A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ,B00005JMJ4,David M. Lovin,"[3, 6]","Sophia Coppola's Lost in Translation is an exercise in character presentation and development.  As you probably know, there is little plot to follow, and no hair raising twists to shock you.  What you do have are two characters you have never seen before, yet you can probably identify with both of them a lot of the time.  Their platonic friendship is refreshing; it's so common these days for strangers to meet, feel attraction, and jump into bed for no reason except that it's in the script.  Because this movie chooses not to go that route, the characters are forced to show us their personalities on the screen, and that turns out to be much more entertaining than I expected it to be.Bill Murray plays an actor who is in Tokyo to shoot a series of ads for a whiskey.  He finds Japan strange; the opening scenes of the movie show him landing on his plane and looking at the culture shock before him.  He has a lot of down time.  We only see him working a few scenes.  The rest of the time, he is wandering through Tokyo with no direction whatsoever.  It is here that Murray's comic ability comes through.  He has done so many comedies that require a large amount of physical acting, here, the looks on his face are all it takes.  When he is in an elevator and he is a foot taller than every other man in there, he has a look on his face that evokes a chuckle.Scarlett Johannsen plays a young newlywed whose husband (Giovanni Ribisi) is a photographer on assignment.  He is always working, leaving her alone to do nothing.  She wanders around, just like Murray.  Eventually they meet in a bar (which they both frequent often).  They strike up a friendship and spend lots of time together doing various things.  Murray is in his 50's and Johannsen is supposedly in her early 20's (although she is really only 18), which in recent cinema has meant a May-December romance.  But not here.  Both are married (Murray's wife calls and sends faxes asking him which color carpet he wants in the house) and there is a great scene where Murray tells Johannsen why marriage is tough, especially once you have kids.It's not so much about the characters being &quot;real&quot; as I have seen from reviewers here.  It's about being able to identify with them.  I was able to see myself and alot of what I feel from the characters on the screen.  Kudos to Murray.  I found him funnier and more entertaining here than I have in a dozen of his comedies before.  Movies are not about special effects, or about shocking moments.  They have always been, and will always be about characters.

619355,AYOPN5ABOAUER,B00005JMJ4,DavidRoss,"[2, 5]","Sofia Coppola's previous feature, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, received widespread praise, yet was one of the most banal movies ever shot on 35mm film.  Her second feature, LOST IN TRANSLATION, has received even more critical praise, plus 3 Golden Globe awards and Oscar nominations for best picture, screenplay, director, and actor.  Surely it must merit such accolades?Alas, it does not.  Although better than her previous turkey, LOST is yet another vapid distraction dolled up with multi-million dollar production values and A-list stars.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deserve praise for making something out of nearly nothing.  Their performances add some soul to characters whom the script paints as nothing more than bland types, devoid of singularity, identity, or development--paltry clich&eacute;s at best.  They even manage to convey a sense of epiphany in their final scene together, which hinges on an utterly unintelligible line he mutters into her ear.  (Even captioning on the DVD reports it as ""Whispering, indistinct.""  Perhaps he said something like, ""Is this a new low for Deus ex machina--God rescuing the screenwriter instead of the hero?"")Since the story is obviously not about character, or conflict, or action, perhaps it is about ennui.  Unfortunately Ms Coppola does not understand the imitative fallacy in art.  The pace drags, with more than half an hour spent establishing the characters' alienation and boredom--already adequately established in the film's opening minutes.  In more skilled hands, the material implicit in the story might make a good feature length movie.  As is, it might make a good 20 minute short.  Too bad the film lasts 104 minutes.  (Yawn.)Though failing as story, the movie might succeed in what film is really about anyway-visual imagery.  It does boast a capable cinematographer, Lance Acord (of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH fame), and was filmed on location in Japan, offering a wealth of opportunity for exotic, beautiful, interesting images.  Acord delivers some nice shots of Tokyo's pulsating lights, a Buddhist monastery, and temple grounds in Kyoto, for instance, and he even makes a hotel pool momentarily interesting.  But the script mostly confines him to banal urban interiors and clogged city streets, not much different wherever you go in the world.  We have seen it all before (including the gratuitous nudity), and there is nothing in this movie to make us want to see it again.  (Sigh.)Finally, since the story focuses on two Yanks adrift in Japan, Japan itself plays a major role in the film.  Sadly, Ms Coppola offers no insight into Japanese culture, character, or values, presenting only superficial glimpses reinforcing well-worn stereotypes:  Japanese talk funny, adulate Westerners, sing karaoke, bow frequently, eat strange food, play video games, etc.  (Ho-hum.)LOST IN TRANSLATION gets 2 stars out of 5-both for the acting.  One star for Bill Murray, at last recognized for the dramatic ability in evidence since MEATBALLS (and blatantly obvious since MAD DOG AND GLORY).  The other for the rest of the cast: Johansson (believable though out of her element), Ribisi (perfect as the adolescent, self-absorbed husband), and Faris (the ditzy blonde starlet-at least I think she was acting).  And to the critics who praised this movie (and Ms Coppola's previous lame effort), I give a big, fat goose egg.",2,Sophomoric filmmaking rescued by good performances,1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,3374,"['Sofia', 'Coppola', 'previous', 'feature', 'THE', 'VIRGIN', 'SUICIDES', 'received', 'widespread', 'praise', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'banal', 'movies', 'ever', 'shot', '35mm', 'film', 'second', 'feature', 'LOST', 'IN', 'TRANSLATION', 'received', 'even', 'more', 'critical', 'praise', '3', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'awards', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'best', 'picture', 'screenplay', 'director', 'actor', 'Surely', 'must', 'merit', 'such', 'accolades', 'Alas', 'not', 'better', 'previous', 'turkey', 'LOST', 'yet', 'vapid', 'distraction', 'dolled', 'up', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'production', 'values', 'A-list', 'stars', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'deserve', 'praise', 'making', 'something', 'nearly', 'nothing', 'performances', 'add', 'soul', 'characters', 'whom', 'script', 'paints', 'nothing', 'more', 'bland', 'types', 'devoid', 'singularity', 'identity', 'development', 'paltry', 'clich', 'eacute', 'best', 'even', 'manage', 'convey', 'sense', 'epiphany', 'final', 'scene', 'together', 'utterly', 'unintelligible', 'line', 'ear', 'Even', 'captioning', 'DVD', 'Whispering', 'indistinct', 'Perhaps', 'said', 'something', 'new', 'low', 'Deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'God', 'rescuing', 'screenwriter', 'instead', 'hero', 'story', 'obviously', 'not', 'character', 'conflict', 'action', 'perhaps', 'ennui', 'Unfortunately', 'Ms', 'Coppola', 'not', 'understand', 'imitative', 'fallacy', 'art', 'pace', 'more', 'hour', 'spent', 'establishing', 'characters', 'alienation', 'boredom', 'already', 'adequately', 'established', 'film', 'opening', 'minutes', 'more', 'skilled', 'hands', 'material', 'implicit', 'story', 'might', 'make', 'good', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'might', 'make', 'good', '20', 'minute', 'short', 'Too', 'bad', 'film', '104', 'minutes', 'Yawn', 'Though', 'failing', 'story', 'movie', 'might', 'succeed', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'anyway-visual', 'imagery', 'boast', 'capable', 'cinematographer', 'Lance', 'Acord', 'BEING', 'JOHN', 'MALKOVICH', 'fame', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Japan', 'offering', 'wealth', 'opportunity', 'exotic', 'beautiful', 'interesting', 'images', 'Acord', 'nice', 'shots', 'Tokyo', 'pulsating', 'lights', 'Buddhist', 'monastery', 'temple', 'grounds', 'Kyoto', 'instance', 'even', 'hotel', 'pool', 'momentarily', 'interesting', 'script', 'mostly', 'banal', 'urban', 'interiors', 'clogged', 'city', 'streets', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'wherever', 'go', 'world', 'have', 'seen', 'including', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'nothing', 'movie', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'Sigh', 'Finally', 'story', 'two', 'Yanks', 'adrift', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'major', 'role', 'film', 'Sadly', 'Ms', 'Coppola', 'insight', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'character', 'values', 'presenting', 'only', 'superficial', 'glimpses', 'reinforcing', 'well-worn', 'stereotypes', 'Japanese', 'talk', 'funny', 'adulate', 'Westerners', 'sing', 'karaoke', 'bow', 'frequently', 'eat', 'strange', 'food', 'play', 'video', 'games', 'etc', 'Ho-hum', 'LOST', 'IN', 'TRANSLATION', '2', 'stars', '5-both', 'acting', 'One', 'star', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'last', 'recognized', 'dramatic', 'ability', 'evidence', 'MEATBALLS', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'MAD', 'DOG', 'AND', 'GLORY', 'other', 'rest', 'cast', 'Johansson', 'believable', 'element', 'Ribisi', 'perfect', 'adolescent', 'self-absorbed', 'husband', 'Faris', 'ditzy', 'blonde', 'starlet-at', 'least', 'think', 'was', 'acting', 'critics', 'who', 'praised', 'movie', 'Ms', 'Coppola', 'previous', 'lame', 'effort', 'give', 'big', 'fat', 'goose', 'egg']",Lost in Translation

On second watch, I found the whole thing an incredible bore. True, there are good points, some jokes, and Johansson is photogenic. The direction is competent, the setting is arresting and seldom used, so all the power to Coppola, but as cool as Murray is supposed to be, I thought his antics tiresome. The inability of Japanese to speak English is funny once, maybe twice, but at a certain point, maybe the third or fourth time, I began to think it was boring and then offensive. The acting is good and the story isn't bad. We understand the boredom and isolation they are going through, we sympathize, I think, because the set up is well-done. She's been left alone by an unloving husband; he's not missed at home and feels unwanted and unneeded. Still, the Japan setting while it works gets old fast because there are no insights, no perceptive observations, really nothing. It is merely an exploited backdrop to a narcissist's breakdown. Everything gets old fast, because as good as the acting is, it cannot hide the absence of a story.  Japan has been the next great thing now for thirty years.

619360,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00005JMJ4,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[5, 8]","&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is an unconventional romantic comedy about two out-of-kilter Americans who find refuge from a dizzying culture in a friendship with romantic undercurrents.  Veteran actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) arrives in Tokyo to shoot a commercial for Suntori whiskey, a job for which he will be paid handsomely - even though he soon realizes that no amount is enough to compensate for his surreal experience with a culture he can't hope to understand.  Meanwhile, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is left day after day by her ditzy photographer husband who is in Tokyo for a shoot (unrelated to Bob's.)  Both Bob and Charlotte are thrown off balance by a city that not only never sleeps but also never lets them sleep.  When they meet in the hotel's bar in the middle of the night, a friendship begins that will take them through some of the strangest aspects of Japanese culture and into a relationship that neither characters wants to relinquish.As much cultural commentary as it is a buddy movie, this film defies true categorization because it shifts unpredictably from one absurd moment to the next, and then anchors itself firmly in honest, quiet scenes that contrast beautifully with the neon glare of the city.  While the eventual meeting of the two protagonists is predictable - there wouldn't be a film without it - nothing else about this film is.  Even the ending goes against convention. Sofia Cuppola uses a light hand, and she has miraculously excised the ham from Bill Murray.  The chemistry between Murray and Johansson is as phenomenal as it is unassuming. The editing is first-rate, and the visuals are stunning.  The one drawback for those used to more conventional movies is the pacing, which is more art house than Hollywood.If you have ever been to Japan, you MUST see this film.  It perfectly captures the surrealism of Tokyo for the visiting American, that brilliant kaleidoscope that never quite seems to make sense when your days have turned into nights, and you wake up every morning at three a.m.  From the television shows to the pachinko parlors to the shabu-shabu menus, everything is dead-on hilarious.  You'll have to watch this film more than once to catch all the jabs since many are in the background.But what if you know nothing about Japan?  You'll like this film anyway for its gentle humor and excellent performances.  &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a truly intelligent comedy that will continue to grow on you even days after its viewing.",4,"Lost in a City, Lost in Life",1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,2502,"['quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'unconventional', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'out-of-kilter', 'Americans', 'who', 'find', 'refuge', 'dizzying', 'culture', 'friendship', 'romantic', 'undercurrents', 'Veteran', 'actor', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Tokyo', 'shoot', 'commercial', 'Suntori', 'whiskey', 'job', 'will', 'be', 'paid', 'handsomely', 'even', 'soon', 'amount', 'enough', 'compensate', 'surreal', 'experience', 'culture', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hope', 'understand', 'Meanwhile', 'Charlotte', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'left', 'day', 'day', 'ditzy', 'photographer', 'husband', 'who', 'Tokyo', 'shoot', 'unrelated', 'Bob', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'thrown', 'balance', 'city', 'not', 'only', 'never', 'sleeps', 'also', 'never', 'sleep', 'When', 'meet', 'hotel', 'bar', 'middle', 'night', 'friendship', 'will', 'take', 'strangest', 'aspects', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'relationship', 'characters', 'relinquish.As', 'much', 'cultural', 'commentary', 'buddy', 'movie', 'film', 'true', 'categorization', 'unpredictably', 'one', 'absurd', 'moment', 'next', 'then', 'anchors', 'firmly', 'honest', 'quiet', 'scenes', 'contrast', 'beautifully', 'neon', 'glare', 'city', 'eventual', 'meeting', 'two', 'protagonists', 'predictable', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'film', 'nothing', 'else', 'film', 'Even', 'ending', 'convention', 'Sofia', 'Cuppola', 'light', 'hand', 'miraculously', 'excised', 'ham', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'chemistry', 'Murray', 'Johansson', 'as', 'phenomenal', 'unassuming', 'editing', 'first-rate', 'visuals', 'are', 'stunning', 'one', 'drawback', 'used', 'more', 'conventional', 'movies', 'pacing', 'more', 'art', 'house', 'Hollywood.If', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'Japan', 'MUST', 'see', 'film', 'perfectly', 'surrealism', 'Tokyo', 'visiting', 'American', 'brilliant', 'kaleidoscope', 'never', 'quite', 'make', 'sense', 'when', 'days', 'have', 'turned', 'nights', 'wake', 'up', 'morning', 'three', 'a.m.', 'television', 'pachinko', 'parlors', 'shabu-shabu', 'menus', 'everything', 'dead-on', 'hilarious', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'more', 'once', 'catch', 'jabs', 'many', 'are', 'background.But', 'what', 'know', 'nothing', 'Japan', ""'ll"", 'like', 'film', 'anyway', 'gentle', 'humor', 'excellent', 'performances', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'truly', 'intelligent', 'comedy', 'will', 'continue', 'grow', 'even', 'days', 'viewing']",Lost in Translation

Maybe I was jealous.  I couldn't do karaoke the way Bill Murray does it.  And after a night on the Tokyo town, I couldn't carry Scarlett Johansson home in my arms and tuck her into bed and turn out the light.  Well, I couldn't carry her.  And she does have pretty eyes and nice legs and beautiful skin.  And she's a good actress, although this part did not stretch her or even challenge her.  And after a fashion one gets used to the slightly arrogant Bill Murray style.  His character is, after all, an action hero who gets paid $2-million to make a whiskey commercial.Whiskey.  I think that is what it is.  I don't like whiskey or cigarettes and I usually don't like people who like cigarettes and whiskey, although I recall a song from my parents' time: ""Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild women/They'll drive you crazy, they'll drive you insane.""  (I'll take the wild, wild women.)  Such might conquer the boredom felt by out-of-towners in a high rise hotel in downtown Tokyo that director Sofia Coppola (Francis Ford's daughter) was at great pains to get across to us in the opening scenes.  I also don't like bars and I think that people who spend their time hanging out in bars are mostly lonely alcoholics.  Ditto for gratuitous smoking in movies and obvious product placements.So I almost gave up on this, but the DVD jacket does say, ""OVER 80 FOUR-STAR REVIEWS.""  (That would five stars on Amazon.)  Something must be wrong with me.  Or maybe there is a big contrast coming in the second half of the film, and all this 21st century, big city, international First World ennui is necessary to set that up.  But isn't it a little heavy how Scarlett hangs around in her panties waiting for her husband to return, and when he does he either goes to sleep or off to doing something else.  Wow, one would think he would NOTICE.  The camera surely does.Okay, I saw the rest of the film and ...There is a lot of artistic shtick in this movie. In fact it would be an art movie if it weren't aimed so directly at the mass mind--well, the mass mind over thirty.  The long pauses and the way the camera lingers to SHOUT: notice this scene! how excellent it is, or to punctuate a point, how profound or how prosaic.But I like the clumsiness of their relationship and the way it is drawn out.The shots of Japan are wonderful, like a travel log.  Mount Fujiyama in gray in the background; Mount Fujisan in the background in full color and snow cap.  The games arcade in Tokyo, the game machines like Vegas slot machines all in a row.  The clean, straight lines of the bars and the exercise rooms, black and whites; the square wooden bowls out of which they drink the wine; the lights at night on the boulevard, outdoing Times Square in their gaudy neon-ness.  The touristy feel to the movie.  The Japanese untranslated.  The sleeplessness as though they were near the Arctic Circle with twenty hours of daylight.  The easy Hollywood feel to the psychology: our hero's pix on the side of trucks drinking Japanese whiskey, suavely; the need for the hero to hide from his public; his obviously dyed hair; the ""satire"" of the blonde mediocre starlet who affects anorexia; the sense that Sofia Coppola lived something like this.  One can imagine her boredom, and then the interested older man.I also liked the bit with the semi-talented lounge singer, again like Las Vegas--her picking him up, so to speak, he too drunk to protest or to remember.  Again the Hollywood idea of the pecking order.  The banality of the glamorous life.It is also to Sofia Coppola's credit that she got the relationship exactly right: she knew how the old guy felt and she knew how the young girl felt, and she knew what was right and what would be the right ending.I guess I should say why this movie affects me and brings out the impatience in me and calls forth my sardonic nature.  It is that I have been there where Bill Murray's character was and I played it the same way.  I am not so sure I did the right thing.  I tell myself I did, but I am not so sure.See this for Sofia Coppola who made her father proud.",5,A Platonic May-September affair,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,4218,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'had', 'trouble', 'movie', 'Old', 'guy', 'young', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'ought', 'work', 'being', 'old', 'guy', 'Maybe', 'was', 'jealous', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'karaoke', 'way', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'night', 'Tokyo', 'town', 'could', ""n't"", 'carry', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'home', 'arms', 'tuck', 'bed', 'turn', 'out', 'light', 'Well', 'could', ""n't"", 'carry', 'have', 'pretty', 'eyes', 'nice', 'legs', 'beautiful', 'skin', 'good', 'actress', 'part', 'did', 'not', 'stretch', 'even', 'challenge', 'fashion', 'one', 'used', 'slightly', 'arrogant', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'style', 'character', 'action', 'hero', 'who', 'paid', '2-million', 'make', 'whiskey', 'commercial.Whiskey', 'think', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'whiskey', 'cigarettes', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'people', 'who', 'like', 'cigarettes', 'whiskey', 'recall', 'song', 'parents', 'time', 'Cigarettes', 'whiskey', 'wild', 'wild', 'women/They', ""'ll"", 'drive', 'crazy', ""'ll"", 'drive', 'insane', ""'ll"", 'take', 'wild', 'wild', 'women', 'Such', 'might', 'conquer', 'boredom', 'felt', 'out-of-towners', 'high', 'rise', 'hotel', 'downtown', 'Tokyo', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'daughter', 'was', 'great', 'pains', 'get', 'opening', 'scenes', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'bars', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'spend', 'time', 'hanging', 'out', 'bars', 'are', 'mostly', 'lonely', 'alcoholics', 'Ditto', 'gratuitous', 'smoking', 'movies', 'obvious', 'product', 'placements.So', 'almost', 'gave', 'up', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'say', '80', 'FOUR-STAR', 'REVIEWS', 'would', 'five', 'stars', 'Amazon', 'Something', 'must', 'be', 'wrong', 'maybe', 'big', 'contrast', 'coming', 'second', 'half', 'film', '21st', 'century', 'big', 'city', 'international', 'First', 'World', 'ennui', 'necessary', 'set', 'up', ""n't"", 'little', 'heavy', 'how', 'Scarlett', 'hangs', 'panties', 'waiting', 'husband', 'return', 'when', 'either', 'sleep', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'Wow', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'NOTICE', 'camera', 'surely', 'does.Okay', 'saw', 'rest', 'film', 'lot', 'artistic', 'shtick', 'movie', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'art', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'aimed', 'so', 'directly', 'mass', 'mind', 'well', 'mass', 'mind', 'thirty', 'long', 'pauses', 'way', 'camera', 'SHOUT', 'notice', 'scene', 'how', 'excellent', 'punctuate', 'point', 'how', 'profound', 'how', 'prosaic.But', 'like', 'clumsiness', 'relationship', 'way', 'drawn', 'out.The', 'shots', 'Japan', 'are', 'wonderful', 'travel', 'log', 'Mount', 'Fujiyama', 'gray', 'background', 'Mount', 'Fujisan', 'background', 'full', 'color', 'snow', 'cap', 'games', 'arcade', 'Tokyo', 'game', 'machines', 'Vegas', 'slot', 'machines', 'row', 'clean', 'straight', 'lines', 'bars', 'exercise', 'rooms', 'black', 'whites', 'square', 'wooden', 'drink', 'wine', 'lights', 'night', 'boulevard', 'outdoing', 'Times', 'Square', 'gaudy', 'neon-ness', 'touristy', 'feel', 'movie', 'Japanese', 'untranslated', 'sleeplessness', 'were', 'Arctic', 'Circle', 'twenty', 'hours', 'daylight', 'easy', 'Hollywood', 'feel', 'psychology', 'hero', 'pix', 'side', 'trucks', 'drinking', 'Japanese', 'whiskey', 'suavely', 'need', 'hero', 'hide', 'public', 'obviously', 'dyed', 'hair', 'satire', 'blonde', 'mediocre', 'starlet', 'who', 'anorexia', 'sense', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'lived', 'something', 'One', 'can', 'imagine', 'boredom', 'then', 'interested', 'older', 'man.I', 'also', 'liked', 'bit', 'semi-talented', 'lounge', 'singer', 'again', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'picking', 'up', 'so', 'speak', 'too', 'protest', 'remember', 'Again', 'Hollywood', 'idea', 'pecking', 'order', 'banality', 'glamorous', 'life.It', 'also', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'credit', 'got', 'relationship', 'exactly', 'right', 'knew', 'how', 'old', 'guy', 'felt', 'knew', 'how', 'young', 'girl', 'felt', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'right', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'ending.I', 'guess', 'should', 'say', 'why', 'movie', 'out', 'impatience', 'forth', 'sardonic', 'nature', 'have', 'been', 'where', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'was', 'played', 'same', 'way', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'tell', 'did', 'am', 'not', 'so', 'sure.See', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'who', 'made', 'father', 'proud']",Lost in Translation

When it was over, I started thinking about what I could have done with that two hours instead of watch this crap.Shockingly, I've encountered many people who thought that this movie was &quot;brilliant,&quot; and that if I didn't like it that I just &quot;didn't understand it.&quot; What's to understand? This movie has no plot, the humor is weak...it's basically as bad as a student art film.I've since come to realize that this movie suffers from the Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome (ENCS). In the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, a vain emperor employs two con artists to tailor a new set of clothes for him. According to the con men, the clothing is so fine that it can only be seen by those of high intelligence. So the con men start weaving nothing, and everyone who goes to examine the &quot;clothing&quot; pretends that they can see it simply because they don't want people to think that they are too dumb to see it. The emperor goes so far as to &quot;wearing&quot; the &quot;clothes&quot; (so basically he's naked) because he's afraid that people will think he is dumb if he admits that he cannot see the fibers.This movie reminded me of that. It's a film with a meandering plot and terrible characters disguised as a &quot;brilliant, intellectual film.&quot; I think most of the people who thought it was brilliant are simply too pompous to admit that the movie was garbage. Instead, they like to think that they are intelligent enough to understand the &quot;hidden meanings.&quot; What hidden meanings?A movie's principal purpose should be to entertain.

619365,A3S7WU6DIH71CC,B00005JMJ4,Denny Vu Quach,"[3, 6]","Bill Murray is Bob Harris, a once popular American actor who now, in his middle-age, has found more acceptance and money from the people of Japan than from his own country. He arrives at a prestigious hotel in Tokyo and is given a royal treatment by his greeters and hosts. He is by himself in the land of the rising sun, his wife and kids having stayed behing in the US while he travels across the globe to do some liquor commercials. This Tokyo excursion will take about a week, and the monetary reward will be quite handsome. Contrast this with Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who is at the same hotel tagging along with her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), as he does a multiple-day photo shoot. John is at work most of the time, and so Charlotte is by herself at the hotel, her attempts to keep from being bored proving fruitless. Both Bob and Charlotte are married people, but they are also very lonely people, and that is what ""Lost In Translation"" is all about.Bob and Charlotte catch glimpses of one another at different places in the hotel, and finally decide to converse in earnest at the hotel bar. The entire plot of the film is about these two people getting to know each other. The story revolves around them. In fact, the story [is] them. Bob, in his early-fifties, is old enough to be Charlotte's dad, but that doesn't matter here. It's not about age. It's about the place, and the points that each of these people are at in their lives. Bob loves his children very much, but we do not sense he feels the same for his wife. We hear her on the phone when she calls him, and the same weary sentiment seems to flow from her voice. They are becoming a couple in name only. Then there's Charlotte & John. Both are young, and both are self-possessed. John is into his photography to the point of neglecting Charlotte. But we get the idea that even if gave her more attention, Charlotte might not really warm up to him. She has issues of her own. If Bob is going through a mid-life crisis, then Charlotte seems to be going through a young-life crisis.""Lost In Translation"" is about being alone. Loneliness doesn't always mean that someone is physically separated from loved ones or from people in general. One can be alone in the middle of a crowded room. Such is the case with Bob & Charlotte. They're in Japan for a week. They don't really speak the language. Bob's wife is in the US, and Charlotte's husband is always at a photo shoot. The two lost souls find each other at the hotel, spend time with one another, and even sleep in the same bed together. But we know that while this is providing a small comfort for the time being, it is not a lasting solution to their problems. And we also understand that both Bob and Charlotte -- even if Bob's wife were in Tokyo with him, and John was by Charlotte's side all the time -- would still be lonely. Their life struggles lie deeper than what one person can provide, especially the persons they have chosen to settle down with.This is probably Bill Murray's most understated performance, and it works brilliantly. He lets you in on Bob's emotions without betraying too much sentimentality. He conveys so much with just a smile, a frown, his body language, or simply the look in his eyes. He should get an Oscar nomination for this. Scarlett Johansson, who left me unimpressed in the movie ""Ghost World"" a few years ago, is excellent in her role here. She portrays Charlotte as a deep, troubled, yet intelligent young woman and, like her co-star, does it without overstating it. (...)Johansson is definitely an actress to watch for in the coming years.Sofia Coppola has succeeded in creating a sliver of time & place with ""Lost In Translation"". It creates two of the most realistic characters to ever grace the cinema. You forget this is a movie, and start to really care for these people as though they really exist. And you get the feeling that this is a single, solitary moment that will be over with and then fondly remembered by the characters for a long time to come. This sweeps over you before the film is even over, much like when you are in the middle of a special occurence or event in your own life, and you stop and think about the fact that at one point - very soon - it will cease to be the present, and will instead become only a nostalgic memory.And there you have ""Lost In Translation""",5,"Lonely Days, Lonely Nights,",1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,4376,"['Bill', 'Murray', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'once', 'popular', 'American', 'actor', 'who', 'now', 'middle-age', 'found', 'more', 'acceptance', 'money', 'people', 'Japan', 'own', 'country', 'prestigious', 'hotel', 'Tokyo', 'given', 'royal', 'treatment', 'greeters', 'hosts', 'land', 'rising', 'sun', 'wife', 'kids', 'having', 'stayed', 'behing', 'US', 'globe', 'do', 'liquor', 'commercials', 'Tokyo', 'excursion', 'will', 'take', 'week', 'monetary', 'reward', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'handsome', 'Contrast', 'Charlotte', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'same', 'hotel', 'tagging', 'along', 'photographer', 'husband', 'John', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'multiple-day', 'photo', 'shoot', 'John', 'work', 'most', 'time', 'so', 'Charlotte', 'hotel', 'attempts', 'keep', 'being', 'bored', 'proving', 'fruitless', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'married', 'people', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'lonely', 'people', 'what', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'about.Bob', 'Charlotte', 'catch', 'glimpses', 'one', 'different', 'places', 'hotel', 'finally', 'decide', 'converse', 'earnest', 'hotel', 'bar', 'entire', 'plot', 'film', 'two', 'people', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'story', 'fact', 'story', '[', ']', 'Bob', 'early-fifties', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'Charlotte', 'dad', ""n't"", 'matter', 'here', 'not', 'about', 'age', 'place', 'points', 'people', 'are', 'lives', 'Bob', 'children', 'very', 'much', 'do', 'not', 'sense', 'same', 'wife', 'hear', 'phone', 'when', 'same', 'weary', 'sentiment', 'flow', 'voice', 'are', 'becoming', 'couple', 'name', 'only', 'Then', 'Charlotte', 'John', 'are', 'young', 'are', 'self-possessed', 'John', 'photography', 'point', 'neglecting', 'Charlotte', 'get', 'idea', 'even', 'gave', 'more', 'attention', 'Charlotte', 'might', 'not', 'really', 'warm', 'up', 'issues', 'own', 'Bob', 'going', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'then', 'Charlotte', 'be', 'going', 'young-life', 'crisis', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'being', 'alone', 'Loneliness', ""n't"", 'always', 'mean', 'someone', 'physically', 'separated', 'loved', 'ones', 'people', 'general', 'One', 'can', 'be', 'alone', 'middle', 'crowded', 'room', 'Such', 'case', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', ""'re"", 'Japan', 'week', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'speak', 'language', 'Bob', 'wife', 'US', 'Charlotte', 'husband', 'always', 'photo', 'shoot', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'find', 'other', 'hotel', 'spend', 'time', 'one', 'even', 'sleep', 'same', 'bed', 'together', 'know', 'providing', 'small', 'comfort', 'time', 'being', 'not', 'lasting', 'solution', 'problems', 'also', 'understand', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'even', 'Bob', 'wife', 'were', 'Tokyo', 'John', 'was', 'Charlotte', 'side', 'time', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'lonely', 'life', 'deeper', 'what', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'provide', 'especially', 'persons', 'have', 'chosen', 'settle', 'down', 'with.This', 'probably', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'most', 'understated', 'performance', 'brilliantly', 'Bob', 'emotions', 'betraying', 'too', 'much', 'sentimentality', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'smile', 'frown', 'body', 'language', 'simply', 'look', 'eyes', 'should', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'left', 'unimpressed', 'movie', 'Ghost', 'World', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'excellent', 'role', 'here', 'Charlotte', 'deep', 'troubled', 'yet', 'intelligent', 'young', 'woman', 'co-star', 'overstating', 'Johansson', 'definitely', 'actress', 'watch', 'coming', 'years.Sofia', 'Coppola', 'succeeded', 'creating', 'sliver', 'time', 'place', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'two', 'most', 'realistic', 'characters', 'ever', 'grace', 'cinema', 'forget', 'movie', 'start', 'really', 'care', 'people', 'really', 'exist', 'get', 'feeling', 'single', 'solitary', 'moment', 'will', 'be', 'then', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'characters', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'film', 'even', 'much', 'when', 'are', 'middle', 'special', 'occurence', 'event', 'own', 'life', 'stop', 'think', 'fact', 'one', 'point', 'very', 'soon', 'will', 'cease', 'be', 'present', 'will', 'instead', 'become', 'only', 'nostalgic', 'memory.And', 'there', 'have', 'Lost', 'Translation']",Lost in Translation

In the strange and even unreal atmosphere of Tokyo, karaoke and game machines we have two not so unreal characters (the young wife of a workaholic photographer and a middle-age almost retired actor who is devoted to whisky advertisements). But what is not unreal is what happen to them. We find really hyper-realistic scenes.Could it happen to you? Of course. To be lost in a strange city in which you have to go for business of any matters is something you (and of course me) can feel. And the only thing you need is human touch, moreover, human presence. It is the necessity of talk about whatever and going anywhere with somebody.The characters are against all that surrounds them except from themselves. The ambient is hostile, and the global feeling is anti-Japanese, anti-karaoke and anti-neon lights. But they find what they need in themselves and soon the city is the cloak they need to hide in.Making a film about boredom leads you to unsuccess, even if you treat the story pleasantly and elegantly.

619367,AVLDQY3JWB6HU,B00005JMJ4,D. Golden,"[9, 13]","With Lost In Translation, Sofia Coppola has definitively proven that her film Virgin Suicides was no fluke. She is a profoundly gifted film maker. Both films move at a different pace from much of what passes for cinema these days. Nothing explodes; the lead actors don't hop into bed;  and there are no hyper dramatic scenes. Instead, each film unfolds at its own pace.Yet there is nothing boring or stagnant in Lost In Translation. There is an easy naturalism to the plot line and the performances.  Of course, achieving this almost serene passage through the story is kind of like a perfect swing of a bat. What appears as effortless is the end result of focus, inspiration and lots of hard work.As I get older ( I'm pushing 50 ). I find that I am constantly amazed by the great poise and skill that so many young actors bring to their work. Scarlett Johanssen is one of these people. My, God, she's a baby! Where does this depth and richness of portrayal come from? When I was her age the two big issues in my life were praying not to end up in Vietnam and seeing to it that my parents didn't know about my partying. When Johanssen is on screen she is mesmerizing, even when she is doing nothing.But what makes this film a cause for celebration to my mind is Bill Murray. I'd pay money to watch him mow his lawn. He has a comic ( or maybe bemused is a better term ) approach to the world that can't be taught in drama school. He is a wonderfully unique actor whose particular skills where used to perfection in this film. His understated but hilarious reactions to Japanese culture are a treat to behold. Murray, like Johannsen, seemingly doesn't have to break a sweat in order to delivery fantastic performances. This film might have been much less successfully absent it's magnificent casting and Coppola's subtle mastery.The plot is almost secondary to the story, because it is the intricate , unique and beautiful relationship that develops between Murray and Johanssen that drives this tale. This is a very special film. It is masterfully framed and filmed. The subtle color palette employed by the cinematography is visually lovely and  lyrically incorporates itself into the specific feel of the story as well as its.physical environment.

619368,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B00005JMJ4,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[3, 6]","I would think that this sort of film would play better on a large screen in a darkened theatre, where the viewer is actually immersed in the images---the flicker of the neon, the passage of the overhead trains---and simultaneously senses that feeling of being lost in the largeness of a cityscape inhabited by so many bodies without any point of reference.  Although, the film takes advantage of the two leads' feelings of disassociation with regard to a seemingly foreign environment, the feeling evoked here by director Sofia Coppala is one all of us has sadly experienced one time or another.Indeed, it is this feeling that drives the small plot: a 50+ actor being paid millions to endorse a Scotch to the Japanese public ponders his aloneness and the meaninglessness of his existence during a whirl of publicity shots, advertizing takes and sojourns to the hotel bar.  At the same time, a 25 year old wife accompanies her photographer husband and stays at the same hotel where she contemplates being stuck in the irrevalent aftermath of someone else's existence. The two characters, both lost and unable to translate what they see around them into any meaningful frame of reference for themselves, turn towards each other, finding solace in their ability to see that they are at the same point of self-discovery within their own lives.Moody and dreary at times, despite the lack of action, the movie does convey that sense of being lost in a world that moves pretty much at light-speed momentum.  Tokyo may stand as the backdrop, but I think Coppola focuses on the world of hype and media in general-a world that conjurs up a pace of its own where human components are mere adjuncts rather than the driving force.  The two main characters question the relevance of such a world and revel in their discovery that together they find, at least for a moment, some translation relevant to their lives which actually causes emotion rather than simply sensation.I certainly do not recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a plot driven movie and who is not willing to sit out the long silences.  Rather than prose, this piece is a poem--a haiku, if you will.  Its message is simple, stark and bleak and the viewer must be willing to enter that sense of nothingness and accept it on its own terms.  Rather this film is recommended to those who want to ponder and think upon the small worlds we create to anchor us in a world pretty much out of control.",5,Aren't We All?,1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,2456,"['would', 'think', 'sort', 'film', 'would', 'play', 'better', 'large', 'screen', 'darkened', 'theatre', 'where', 'viewer', 'actually', 'immersed', 'images', '-the', 'flicker', 'neon', 'passage', 'overhead', 'trains', '-and', 'simultaneously', 'feeling', 'being', 'lost', 'largeness', 'cityscape', 'inhabited', 'so', 'many', 'bodies', 'point', 'reference', 'film', 'advantage', 'two', 'leads', 'feelings', 'disassociation', 'regard', 'seemingly', 'foreign', 'environment', 'feeling', 'evoked', 'here', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppala', 'one', 'sadly', 'experienced', 'one', 'time', 'another.Indeed', 'feeling', 'small', 'plot', '50+', 'actor', 'being', 'paid', 'millions', 'endorse', 'Scotch', 'Japanese', 'public', 'ponders', 'aloneness', 'meaninglessness', 'existence', 'whirl', 'publicity', 'shots', 'advertizing', 'hotel', 'bar', 'same', 'time', '25', 'year', 'old', 'wife', 'photographer', 'husband', 'stays', 'same', 'hotel', 'where', 'being', 'stuck', 'irrevalent', 'aftermath', 'someone', 'else', 'existence', 'two', 'characters', 'lost', 'unable', 'translate', 'what', 'see', 'meaningful', 'frame', 'reference', 'turn', 'towards', 'other', 'finding', 'solace', 'ability', 'see', 'are', 'same', 'point', 'self-discovery', 'own', 'lives.Moody', 'dreary', 'times', 'lack', 'action', 'movie', 'convey', 'sense', 'being', 'lost', 'world', 'pretty', 'much', 'light-speed', 'momentum', 'Tokyo', 'may', 'stand', 'backdrop', 'think', 'Coppola', 'world', 'hype', 'media', 'general-a', 'world', 'up', 'pace', 'own', 'where', 'human', 'components', 'are', 'mere', 'adjuncts', 'rather', 'driving', 'force', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'question', 'relevance', 'world', 'revel', 'discovery', 'together', 'find', 'least', 'moment', 'translation', 'relevant', 'lives', 'actually', 'emotion', 'rather', 'simply', 'sensation.I', 'certainly', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'plot', 'driven', 'movie', 'who', 'not', 'willing', 'sit', 'out', 'long', 'silences', 'Rather', 'prose', 'piece', 'poem', 'haiku', 'will', 'message', 'simple', 'stark', 'bleak', 'viewer', 'must', 'be', 'willing', 'enter', 'sense', 'nothingness', 'accept', 'own', 'terms', 'Rather', 'film', 'recommended', 'who', 'want', 'ponder', 'think', 'small', 'worlds', 'create', 'anchor', 'world', 'pretty', 'much', 'control']",Lost in Translation

The two treasures are Mystic River and Lost In Translation.Yes, the movie may run incredibly slow at times, is seldom upbeat and even without any significant climax. Then why was this movie able to shine. It's really the good combination of good acting and directing. Hemled by second time director, Sophia Coppola (incidentally also nomianted for Best Director and Best Screenplay), she was very much able to explore and bring out the inner struggles of two helplessly souls in a foreign land. The director deliberately makes use of the slow pace to showcase the development of a great platonic friendship between the most unlikely of couples.The special effect here is really the superb performance by the two leads. The sweetly innocent Scarlett Johansson puts on excellent portrayal of a lost wife stuck in the monotony of a seemingly aimless marriage. Bill Murray, nomianted for a Best Actor Oscar, is convincing as a has-been actor making a quick buck in Japan trying to promote Japanese beer. Dejected and totally indifferent most of the time, his world suddenly lights up when he meets a transient soulmate. Both married to others but still can't find the fulfilment they want in life. It's ultimately about the power of silence and how greatly it wrecks relationships. It's also about how amazing relationships can develop no matter how strange the situation is or the people are.It's a good while since such great human drama has ben played on screens withou the need for steamy sex scenes or extreme violence.

The movie seemed a bit strange and I wondered why Bill Murray was in such a flat, depressing comedy about really nothing at all. I didn't get it. In Spring of 2005, not long after I had returned from three weeks in Shinjuku, Tokyo I watched it again. Now the familiarity of the location really captured my attention. I had stayed at the Hilton Tokyo, just two blocks from the Park Hyatt hotel Bob Harris (Murray's character) was in. This is not me trying to brag or anything, but me just saying that the movie now presented a reality I had recently experienced. I could relate. It was almost surreal. My company had sent me there solo for three weeks to work with a customer. I was by myself a good amount of the time and had a lot of freedom to experience Tokyo as best I could. Navigating the subway, surfing the hotel TV stations (most all in Japanese, except BBC), and experiencing a few restaurants, shops, and grocers were among my biggest adventures. This is not a review of my trip, but my newfound love of Tokyo made so many moments in the movie stand out. When Bob is surfing the hotel stations you catch a few seconds of World Chart Express, something I watched A LOT of and how I came to know about YUKI and discover my favorite song of 2005, ""Joy"". Also when Bob is just arriving into Tokyo from the airport and just looks so beat, but is kind of in awe of the lights and brilliance of the city... that was me. I remember getting to the hotel about midnight and not really being able to sleep. Anyway, the movie just really struck a chord with me in many ways. I also picked up on and could relate to the general theme of the movie about two lonely people out of their element. Anyway, Murray's humor here is very understated but still very Bill Murray. I find it hilarious at times, but not strictly a comedy. There are a lot of quiet moments that get you thinking about what's important in life, and about finding or searching for someone, if only a friend, that you are really comfortable being with. Don't let all the bad reviews scare you off.

But that's not really necessary.  Coppola established herself as an excellent director with The Virgin Suicides, a film that is in fact superior to her latest effort.There's plenty to admire about Lost in Translation.  Coppola has a light touch that gives her pictures a distinct atmosphere that lingers far beyond viewing.  The movie continually has the feel of watching the sun rise after you've been drunk all night, and I mean that in a good way.  Plus, any movie that showcases Bill Murray and compels Kevin Shields to begin recording music again has a lot going for it.But Lost in Translation is ultimately undone by a single weakness: Nothing ever happens.  And I mean it.  There's no real plot to speak of, no major shifts in character, no progression that compels the viewer to keep on watching.  I don't mean that someone has to be shot or that people have to start hooking up all over the place.  But in a movie, something, anything, has to happen.  Otherwise, why watch?  Many people, oddly enough, find this lack of story to be a strength of the film.  I can't even begin to know why.Not that Coppola doesn't have numerous chances to construct a deeper story.  But moments that could introduce conflict (like Bill Murray's character sleeping with a lounge singer), are instead left dangling, almost as if they never happened.  And because the story doesn't really go anywhere, we don't get a chance to see the two leads characters emote.  There are lots of hangdog stares, exasperated looks around, and so forth.  But that isn't enough to keep the film together.  The end result feels slapped together, unstructured.  It was Coppola's intent to make you feel as lost and adrift as her main characters.  In that regard, she succeeds, but that doesn't mean the movie itself does.There are also some oddly juvenile bits in the movie, particularly as they relate to Japanese culture.  There are some jokes about Japanese people speaking broken English, switching R's and L's.  But these are fairly tired stereotypes (even if they are occasionally true), and it makes the situations feel forced, even contrived.Lost in Translation was clearly based on real events in Coppola's life.  And while, voyeuristically, that makes it occasionally compelling, that shouldn't be the reason we're watching.  Coppola seems to have documented a portion of her life she is still unable to make sense of.  What did she learn?  How has she changed as person?  Either she didn't, or we aren't allowed to know, and that makes Lost in Translation an ultimately frustrating experience.",2,A Film Where Everything is Adrift,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,2708,"['Many', 'critics', 'are', 'still', 'process', 'absolving', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Godfather', 'III', 'heaping', 'lavish', 'praise', 'upon', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'not', 'really', 'necessary', 'Coppola', 'established', 'excellent', 'director', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'film', 'fact', 'superior', 'latest', 'plenty', 'admire', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Coppola', 'light', 'touch', 'pictures', 'distinct', 'atmosphere', 'far', 'viewing', 'movie', 'continually', 'feel', 'watching', 'sun', 'rise', ""'ve"", 'been', 'drunk', 'night', 'mean', 'good', 'way', 'movie', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'compels', 'Kevin', 'Shields', 'begin', 'recording', 'music', 'again', 'lot', 'going', 'it.But', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'ultimately', 'undone', 'single', 'weakness', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'mean', 'real', 'plot', 'speak', 'major', 'shifts', 'character', 'progression', 'viewer', 'keep', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'someone', 'be', 'shot', 'people', 'have', 'start', 'hooking', 'up', 'place', 'movie', 'something', 'anything', 'happen', 'Otherwise', 'why', 'watch', 'Many', 'people', 'oddly', 'enough', 'find', 'lack', 'story', 'be', 'strength', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'know', 'why.Not', 'Coppola', ""n't"", 'have', 'numerous', 'chances', 'construct', 'deeper', 'story', 'moments', 'could', 'introduce', 'conflict', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'sleeping', 'lounge', 'singer', 'are', 'instead', 'left', 'dangling', 'almost', 'never', 'happened', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'two', 'characters', 'emote', 'are', 'lots', 'hangdog', 'stares', 'exasperated', 'so', 'forth', ""n't"", 'enough', 'keep', 'film', 'together', 'end', 'result', 'feels', 'slapped', 'together', 'unstructured', 'was', 'Coppola', 'intent', 'make', 'feel', 'lost', 'adrift', 'main', 'characters', 'regard', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'oddly', 'juvenile', 'bits', 'movie', 'particularly', 'relate', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'are', 'jokes', 'Japanese', 'people', 'speaking', 'broken', 'English', 'switching', 'R', 'L', 'are', 'fairly', 'tired', 'stereotypes', 'even', 'are', 'occasionally', 'true', 'situations', 'feel', 'forced', 'even', 'contrived.Lost', 'Translation', 'was', 'clearly', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'Coppola', 'life', 'voyeuristically', 'occasionally', 'compelling', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'reason', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Coppola', 'have', 'documented', 'portion', 'life', 'still', 'unable', 'make', 'sense', 'What', 'did', 'learn', 'How', 'changed', 'person', 'did', ""n't"", 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'know', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'ultimately', 'frustrating', 'experience']",Lost in Translation

But if you like to occasionally see a window on everyday life--albeit amongst a show biz elite with unlimited funds--you'll find Lost In Translation well worth seeing. It is not about things happening, about plot points, but about simply BEing; in an alien environment in an alienated state of mind. It is very much about mood and feelings that simply circle around and never really arrive anywhere. It is about how people who have no reason to connect, somehow do, temporarily, because of these strange circumstances they're in.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[5, 8]","While Bill Murray will likely never be known as being a mega-successful actor in drama films, he takes another crack at it in this current movie.  He plays a beyond-middle-aged movie star who is getting paid millions to do advertisements for a Japanese whisky company.  Fittingly, they want to do the marketing work in Japan.While there he comes across a lovely young 20-something girl (Scarlett Johansson) who is staying in his hotel.  The two kick off a highly unlikely friendship that is the centerpoint of the plot.  Both are married but a bit lonely in their relationships.  Both dislike Japan, but enjoy each others company.  From spending time together they begin to actually relish their time spent in the foreign land.Having lived in Japan for a few years myself, I found the movie especially nostalgic.  I could relate to much of the culture shock depicted as I went through it myself.  There is nothing so helpless as being surrounded by people who do not speak the same language as you do.To be sure, this is a film that meanders a bit.  It is not a tight, cohesive story.  Rather, it does leave some loose ends, basically offering speculations on final outcomes to the viewer of the DVD.  This is not necessarily bad, but a lot of people may not like it.  In short, the film is more in an impressionistic mode than a storytelling mode.Surprisingly enough, the #1 reason to pick this movie up is the performance of Scarlett Johansson.  Her demure, subtle beauty & character steals the show away from the great Bill Murray.  She is so docile and seems so innocent that you will want to hug her!Also, while I'm normally not a huge fan of Rock Videos in the bonus features, the one on this DVD did capture the essence of what the movie was ""about.""  It showed Ms. Johansson walking the streets of Tokyo in a daze that made me think of Lewis Carrol's ALICE IN WONDERLAND.So, here is the bottom line:  if you like movies that depict Romantic (or pseudo-Romantic?) escapades to foreign lands, this one might be worth checking out.

What should have been a simple assignment turns into an extended agony, who is unable to communicate with his intense Japanese director.  Harris suffers from jet-lag and the nagging of a spouse many time zones away.Charlotte (Johansson) is a young wife accompanying her workaholic photographer husband on assignment.

She and Harris meet at the bar, strike up a casual acquaintence, and end up exploring the bizarre neon-lit nighttime Tokyo landscape.  Along the way, they learn to cope with their shared exile.  Director Sophia Coppola avoids the easy off-ramps for the relationship; the two keep a certain distance and the ending is subtle, touching, and somehow appropriate.

This is not a movie you can take lightly, one way or the other. To figure out if you'll enjoy this film, ask yourself the following questions:1. Do you like Bill Murray as an actor?2. Do you like Scarlett Johansson as an actress?3. Do you like chick flicks?4. Do you have a high tolerance - even a liking - for movies that are character driven instead of plot driven, i.e. the movie consists primarily of a series of neat character bits with very little forward momentum to the plot?If, like me, you can answer yes to all of the above, you'll probably love this movie. If you answered no to any of them, probably not.Bill Murray is Bob Harris, middle-aged movie actor and former star of a Seventies private eye TV show. Bob is in Japan, where his show is still amazingly popular, to film a whiskey commercial. Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte, in her early 20s. Charlotte is in Japan accompanying a neglectful photographer husband more interested in partying with the beautiful people than spending any time at all with his wife. (And does this man not have eyes? You want ""beautiful people""? Does he not realize his wife looks exactly like Scarlett Johansson?)Bob and Charlotte find themselves guests in the same impersonal hotel, isolated in a country where neither speak the language, both in unfulfilling marriages that, from what we see and hear on-screen, just might not be lasting too terribly much longer. And yet they both take their marriage vows seriously. This is the story of how two people, with absolutely no sexuality at all, still fall deeply, mutually in love, and how they deal with that.Some people feel the end of Lost In Translation is a total copout.

It never ceases to amaze me how we live in what is supposedly the freest country in the world and yet so many Americans are deathly afraid and even contemptuous of artistic freedom when they find it.Is LOST IN TRANSLATION short on plot?  Yes.  Are several scenes in which the actors portray their characters improvised? Yes.  Are the actors playing real people in real situations making flawed but human choices?  Yes.  And I can't imagine the people who did not like the film for these reasons--the central ones that made me give this movie four stars--enjoying much of anything beyond the standard action movie fare, with its mind-numbing cinematic conventions that are older than dirt and half as exciting.Sophia Coppola--daughter of the master Francis himself--has made a fantastic exploration into human emotion and the depth of human longing and love with this film, in the frame of today's paradoxically plastic and ancient Tokyo.  Scarlett Johansson gives a performance that belies her age, carrying the expressions of emotions that seem to have a wisdom about them in their intensity.  And Bill Murray's work is reminiscent of Miles Davis; understated, cool, ragefully/triumphantly quiet at the perfect times, emotionally detached in his representation of passion and excitement at others.  He deserved the Oscar nomination for this work, as did Sophia for an enigmatic screenplay that deceptively reveals as much realism as any Impressionist piece by Monet or any of the photography of Steichen.You won't need to try and enjoy this movie with an open mind or anything.  Just see it without trying to control it, and watch what happens.  It is sweet--not like candy, but like Peppermint Schnapps; with a bite.

The two finally meet over drinks, and begin to bond and explore the city of Tokyo. Bob is in a downtempo midlife crisis, while Charlotte is unsure what to do with her life. And they both learn that they have things to teach one another...A small warning: ""Lost in Translation"" has very little plot. And yes, it can be pretentious at times, sometimes politically incorrect. Fortunately, Sofia Coppola's second full-length film has qualities to make up for its improvised plot, with the beautiful cinematography, good direction and outstanding acting by its two main leads. It's a movie that requires patience and slow unfolding.Loneliness is the theme of this movie. Particularly, it's the loneliness of the soul -- Charlotte and Bob are surrounded by people, yet they feel alone. Hanging out together alleviates their loneliness for a little while, even though their problems won't go away. As a result, some parts of it can feel hollow. But at the same time, it gives the film a more realistic feeling -- often people in such situations DON'T deal with it.In keeping with the theme, Coppola keeps the movie slow and pensive, with plenty of beautiful cinematography and exquisite shots of Tokyo. The entire film has a slightly shadowy, glowing look. And the quiet dialogue has a witty, acerbic edge, such as when dizzy blonde Kelly announces ""I'm under Evelyn Waugh,"" only to have Charlotte inform her that, ""Evelyn Waugh was a man.""Bill Murray rules this film, with his understated expressions and world-weary attitude. It's surprising that someone could act so blase, and yet be strangely charming. Scarlett Johansson proves that she is no longer just another child star, with a solid performance that stacks up well beside veteran Murray's.Strange, slow and pensive, this is a film that takes some getting used to; it may even take multiple viewings to fully ""get.""

After seeing it, I'm wondering if the critics saw a completely different film.  It's certainly different from its rivals for Best Picture, but different isn't always better.Critical accolades and Oscar nominations aside, ""Lost In Translation"" suffers from a complete lack of plot and character development.  Director Sofia Coppola certainly has an eye for interesting shots, but her talents as a screenwriter need development.  Coppola is astounded at what her camera finds in Japan, but will you be?  Wow: Japan has karaoke!  Video arcades!  Obnoxious talk show hosts!  What a crazy country!Billed as a romantic comedy,  ""Lost In Translation"" takes forever to go nowhere.  70 minutes pass before lead characters Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have a serious conversation.  Up to that point, the film presents a ""slice of life"" view of Japan.  Murray and Johansson run from one party to another, enjoying each other's company but never really developing any rapport or chemistry.  Coppola falls in love with her shots, but lingers way too long on each one, utterly failing to develop any dramatic momentum.  The talented Giovanni Ribisi is wasted in a nothing role.I'm certainly not biased against films with a minimum of dialogue or action (after all, my favorite film is ""2001: a space odyssey"").  But Coppola's talents have not developed to the point where she can find the right notes in such a subtle story.  Perhaps she had a great film in Japan, but something has indeed been ""lost in translation.""",2,Did the critics see a different film?,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,1637,"['just', 'saw', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'last', 'night', 'trying', 'view', '2003', 'Oscar', 'Contenders', 'February', '29', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'seeing', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'critics', 'saw', 'completely', 'different', 'film', 'certainly', 'different', 'rivals', 'Best', 'Picture', 'different', ""n't"", 'always', 'better.Critical', 'accolades', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'aside', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'suffers', 'complete', 'lack', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'Director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'certainly', 'eye', 'interesting', 'shots', 'talents', 'screenwriter', 'need', 'development', 'Coppola', 'astounded', 'what', 'camera', 'Japan', 'will', 'be', 'Wow', 'Japan', 'karaoke', 'Video', 'Obnoxious', 'talk', 'show', 'What', 'crazy', 'country', 'Billed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'forever', 'go', 'nowhere', '70', 'minutes', 'pass', 'lead', 'characters', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'have', 'serious', 'conversation', 'Up', 'point', 'film', 'slice', 'life', 'view', 'Japan', 'Murray', 'Johansson', 'run', 'one', 'party', 'enjoying', 'other', 'company', 'never', 'really', 'developing', 'rapport', 'chemistry', 'Coppola', 'love', 'shots', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'one', 'utterly', 'failing', 'develop', 'dramatic', 'momentum', 'talented', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'wasted', 'nothing', 'role.I', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'biased', 'films', 'minimum', 'dialogue', 'action', 'favorite', 'film', '2001', 'space', 'odyssey', 'Coppola', 'talents', 'have', 'not', 'developed', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'right', 'notes', 'such', 'subtle', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'great', 'film', 'Japan', 'something', 'indeed', 'been', 'lost', 'translation']",Lost in Translation

Capabilities that will hopefully be developed and explored further in the future. Where much of 'Lost in Translation''s beauty comes from is the knowledge of where to allow silences between the characters. This is not a film that is cluttered with unnecessary dialogue, but instead allows silent bonds to develop between the characters, as well as emotions that are unexpressable through conventional speech.Although never truely spoken or discussed, the silent desperation of Charlotte and Bob is palpable. These are two people who, despite their differing lifestyles, are equally lost, alone and desperate for someone who understands them. This is what gives the film its tragic beauty. Within this script it would have been all too easy to fall into the 'mid-life crisis' cliches, however these are deftly avoided.It is not just the scriptwriting that is remarkable in this film. The preformances by both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are pitch perfect in what was an outstanding piece of casting.

It had great preformances, great story, great comedy, great heart, and it was just overall a great movie. In one of my earlier reviews I think I mentioned that it is not hard for me to like a movie, but sometimes it could be hard for me to love a movie. I really did truly love this movie, and during it I could connect with the characters. It also made me think. It took place in Japan and there was one scene where Scarlett Johansson is going sightseeing was a very beautiful scene because I was able to see Japan the way another person might see it. You could also appricate how other people feel about the certain sights.Bill Murrey stars as Bob Harris who is an American actor of film, in Japan for a short period of time to shoot a seris of commericals for a brand of Whiskey. Scarlet Johannson is ia graduate named Charlotte who is in Japan and in the same hotel as Bob except for a different reason. She is there for her photographer husband John, but she does not have to do any work at all. Bob and Charlotte are not happy in their marriages and lives. Bob is in the middle of a mid life crisis, and although Charlotte loves her husband, she wants to go home where she can speak American again. Charlotte also is upset that John is spending alot of time with Kelly, another American who already knows and likes John. Since both Bob and Charlotte have trouble sleeping they begin to spend alot of time together. Bob stays in town longer to appear on a tv talk show and they become friends, while also becoming a little more happier in life.I am still thinking about what kind of movie this is. A comedy or a drama. It's one of those confusing genres like ""About Schmidt,"" or ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" It is a mixture of comedy and drama. But I want to talk about the very last scene. It is the last scene with Bob and Charlotte together in Japan and Bob whispers something in her ear. But you don't hear what he says. It could be anything. He could be saying goodbye, or saying where she could reach him, or even something else. But the reason why they don't tell you is because you don't need to know. At that point in the film, you don't have to know everything that Bob and Charlotte have to say to each other. They deserve privacy and that is exactly what the director gives them. I hope this review makes it to amazon because I feel that I thought alot about this movie as I wrote about it.

619397,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JMJ4,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 4]","The deluxe Park Hyatt Tokyo provides the backdrop for this quirky film about the evolving relationship between Bob Harris, a world-weary movie actor in town to pocket easy money for a Suntory whiskey advertising campaign, and Charlotte, an obviously smart young wife of a thoughtless, ambitious video director. Through happenstance, these two characters come together and over the course of the film, discover they are soulmates.This deceptively simple concept has been given a stylized and perceptive treatment by screenwriter and director Sofia Coppola, who has an obvious fondness for her characters and the setting. As a third-generation Japanese-American who has been to Tokyo a few times, I found the film was full of shrewd observations about current Japanese culture - the expansive karaoke hotel suite, the antiseptic strip club, the anal-retentive hospital waiting room, the Day-Glo Japanese talk show with the maniacally congenial host. I doubt if any other stateside filmmaker has captured the blinding lights and claustrophobic hustle of Tokyo better, much less the actual Japanese people in the way Coppola has done here without resorting to stereotypes. The scenes dealing with the communication barriers, while comically effective, actually feel authentic, not condescending.Upon first viewing on its initial release, I think the film was overrated given its saturated airplay during the entire awards season earlier this year, perhaps as an indie-endorsing affront to the juggernaut that was ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"".  Now that a few months have elapsed, I can appreciate the movie more for its vivid sense of imagery and atmosphere, which does go a long way to compensate for the threadbare plot. The excellent soundtrack helps as well. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson perform their roles as Bob and Charlotte in an almost improvisational manner, effortlessly achieving a genuine chemistry. Coppola's focus on Bob still feels a bit lopsided since it ultimately makes Charlotte more cryptic than she needs to be. For all its charms, the film does not take ultimate accountability for the changes that Bob and especially Charlotte go through, which is why I think the film falls somewhat short for me. Though the much-talked about ending is lovely and seems to signal a reunion in the future, one still gets the sense that the episode was nothing more than a warm, dream-like episode in their lives. I guess I expected to see more honest character development for all the praise heaped on this film.",4,"Tokyo Captured Vividly, Nice Chemistry...But Is That Enough?",1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,2541,"['deluxe', 'Park', 'Hyatt', 'Tokyo', 'backdrop', 'quirky', 'film', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'world-weary', 'movie', 'actor', 'town', 'pocket', 'easy', 'money', 'Suntory', 'whiskey', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'Charlotte', 'obviously', 'smart', 'young', 'wife', 'thoughtless', 'ambitious', 'video', 'director', 'happenstance', 'two', 'characters', 'come', 'together', 'course', 'film', 'are', 'soulmates.This', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'concept', 'been', 'given', 'stylized', 'perceptive', 'treatment', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'who', 'obvious', 'fondness', 'characters', 'setting', 'third-generation', 'Japanese-American', 'who', 'been', 'Tokyo', 'few', 'times', 'found', 'film', 'was', 'full', 'shrewd', 'observations', 'current', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'expansive', 'karaoke', 'hotel', 'suite', 'antiseptic', 'strip', 'club', 'anal-retentive', 'hospital', 'waiting', 'room', 'Day-Glo', 'Japanese', 'talk', 'show', 'maniacally', 'congenial', 'host', 'doubt', 'other', 'stateside', 'filmmaker', 'captured', 'blinding', 'lights', 'claustrophobic', 'hustle', 'Tokyo', 'better', 'much', 'less', 'actual', 'Japanese', 'people', 'way', 'Coppola', 'done', 'here', 'resorting', 'stereotypes', 'scenes', 'dealing', 'communication', 'barriers', 'comically', 'effective', 'actually', 'feel', 'authentic', 'not', 'condescending.Upon', 'first', 'viewing', 'initial', 'release', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'overrated', 'given', 'saturated', 'airplay', 'entire', 'awards', 'season', 'earlier', 'year', 'perhaps', 'indie-endorsing', 'affront', 'juggernaut', 'was', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', 'Now', 'few', 'months', 'have', 'elapsed', 'can', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'more', 'vivid', 'sense', 'imagery', 'atmosphere', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'compensate', 'threadbare', 'plot', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'well', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'perform', 'roles', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'almost', 'improvisational', 'manner', 'effortlessly', 'achieving', 'genuine', 'chemistry', 'Coppola', 'focus', 'Bob', 'still', 'bit', 'lopsided', 'ultimately', 'Charlotte', 'more', 'cryptic', 'be', 'charms', 'film', 'not', 'take', 'ultimate', 'accountability', 'changes', 'Bob', 'especially', 'Charlotte', 'go', 'why', 'think', 'film', 'somewhat', 'short', 'much-talked', 'ending', 'lovely', 'signal', 'reunion', 'future', 'one', 'still', 'sense', 'episode', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'warm', 'dream-like', 'episode', 'lives', 'guess', 'expected', 'see', 'more', 'honest', 'character', 'development', 'praise', 'heaped', 'film']",Lost in Translation

However, &quot;Japan&quot; was not the theme of this movie.  The characters could have been anywhere, so long as it was someplace that made them feel like &quot;outsiders&quot;, and Tokyo, as it is presented in the West, is a modern location which most Westerners think of as distant in every sense of the word.  Of course, the Tokyo presented in this film is the image we get in the States (via Hollywood, television, and any number of fringe news articles about social trends and electronic gadgets), as opposed to the real place.  As an example, for those of you who have been to New York City, compare the real thing with the city presented to you in the movie &quot;Seven&quot;, which plays to every stereotype purveyed by those who have never visited of crime, perversity and destitution.The slow speed of the film did not bother me in the least.  It's a film about the characters, not their environment, past, or future.  It's a study of loneliness and anger.  Charlotte, an otherwise educated woman, bad-mouths everything she sees or tries, from the lunch she eats with Bob (&quot;shabu-shabu&quot;, which is delicious, by the way), to the pronunciation of the locals' English.  This shouldn't be confused with an endorsement of those sentiments on the part of the director.  Rather, it is a window into the character's own youth (read: childishness) and inexperience, coupled with her deep unhappiness with her own life.I do not agree that most people who have visited a foreign environment should relate to this.  I fully endorse a number of other reviewers who have mentioned that a normal person would be interested in the adventure of Japan, of seeing new things, and of interacting with new people.  But Bob and Charlotte are not normal people.  If they were, there would be no movie.  What makes a movie worth watching (any movie) is that it is about something out of the ordinary, whether that something occurs outside of the characters or inside.That said, I often found Bob's jokes at the expense of the people around him to be in bad taste.  Almost every Japanese person he met in this movie was going out of their way to be kind and make him feel at home, but he often made fun of them.  This is the kind of behavior that is often considered &quot;cool&quot; in the West, but you won't find much of it in Japan, thank goodness.I've mentioned above, you don't need to agree with everything these characters do- they're not heroes- but his actions damaged my ability to sympathize with him.As for the dialogue itself, this is a film with less dialogue than average, so it was a pity to see so many throw-away lines.  I realize that most of the acting and character-development was silent, but that's no reason not to have quality dialogue also.  A small example of this is the scene in the strip-club.  Nothing here is said of any imporance.  In fact, the entire scene could have been lifted right out of the movie without effect.Finally, to review the DVD itself.  Please note that my rating of four stars is for the film, not the DVD, which would get two at best.  This is the one and only DVD I have ever owned or rented which actually requires you to watch all of the previews.  To me, this is unforgiveable, and it is enough to ensure that I will never purchase another title from Focus Features.  The only option you have is to fast-forward, old-fashioned VCR-style.  This is bad enough, but my own player has only 2x fast forwarding available, making the process annoying, to put it extremely mildly and expletive-free.In short, this film is worth watching at least once, but (DVD aside) I doubt it will stand up to repeat viewings for most people.",4,Good Performances,1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,4395,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'felt', 'film', 'lived', 'up', 'hype', 'not', 'unusual', 'thing', 'say', 'movie', 'general', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'photography', 'was', 'good', 'script', 'was', 'mediocre.This', 'story', 'two', 'dissatisfied', 'people', 'who', 'meet', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'most', 'famously', 'incarnation', 'British', 'classic', 'quot', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'quot', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'sports', 'far', 'better', 'performances', 'leads', 'will', 'course', 'be', 'more', 'accessible', 'contemporary', 'audience', 'suffers', 'weaker', 'script.Living', 'loving', 'Japan', 'found', 'many', 'stereotypes', 'be', 'untrue', 'occassionally', 'objectionable', 'However', 'quot', 'Japan', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'theme', 'movie', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'anywhere', 'so', 'long', 'was', 'someplace', 'made', 'feel', 'quot', 'outsiders', 'quot', 'Tokyo', 'presented', 'West', 'modern', 'location', 'most', 'Westerners', 'think', 'distant', 'sense', 'word', 'course', 'Tokyo', 'presented', 'film', 'image', 'get', 'States', 'Hollywood', 'television', 'number', 'fringe', 'news', 'articles', 'social', 'trends', 'electronic', 'gadgets', 'opposed', 'real', 'place', 'example', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'compare', 'real', 'thing', 'city', 'presented', 'movie', 'quot', 'Seven', 'quot', 'stereotype', 'purveyed', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'visited', 'crime', 'perversity', 'destitution.The', 'slow', 'speed', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'least', 'film', 'characters', 'not', 'environment', 'past', 'future', 'study', 'loneliness', 'anger', 'Charlotte', 'otherwise', 'educated', 'woman', 'bad-mouths', 'everything', 'tries', 'lunch', 'Bob', 'quot', 'shabu-shabu', 'quot', 'delicious', 'way', 'pronunciation', 'locals', 'English', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'confused', 'endorsement', 'sentiments', 'part', 'director', 'Rather', 'window', 'character', 'own', 'youth', 'read', 'childishness', 'inexperience', 'coupled', 'deep', 'unhappiness', 'own', 'life.I', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'visited', 'foreign', 'environment', 'should', 'relate', 'fully', 'endorse', 'number', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'mentioned', 'normal', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'adventure', 'Japan', 'seeing', 'new', 'things', 'interacting', 'new', 'people', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'not', 'normal', 'people', 'were', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'What', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'something', 'ordinary', 'something', 'characters', 'inside.That', 'said', 'often', 'found', 'Bob', 'jokes', 'expense', 'people', 'be', 'bad', 'taste', 'Japanese', 'person', 'met', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'way', 'be', 'kind', 'make', 'feel', 'home', 'often', 'made', 'fun', 'kind', 'behavior', 'often', 'considered', 'quot', 'cool', 'quot', 'West', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'Japan', 'thank', 'goodness.I', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'agree', 'everything', 'characters', 'do-', ""'re"", 'not', 'heroes-', 'actions', 'damaged', 'ability', 'sympathize', 'him.As', 'dialogue', 'film', 'less', 'dialogue', 'average', 'was', 'pity', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'throw-away', 'lines', 'realize', 'most', 'acting', 'character-development', 'was', 'silent', 'reason', 'not', 'have', 'quality', 'dialogue', 'also', 'A', 'small', 'example', 'scene', 'strip-club', 'Nothing', 'here', 'said', 'imporance', 'fact', 'entire', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'right', 'movie', 'effect.Finally', 'review', 'DVD', 'Please', 'note', 'rating', 'four', 'stars', 'film', 'not', 'DVD', 'would', 'get', 'two', 'best', 'one', 'only', 'DVD', 'have', 'ever', 'owned', 'rented', 'actually', 'watch', 'previews', 'unforgiveable', 'enough', 'ensure', 'will', 'never', 'purchase', 'title', 'Focus', 'Features', 'only', 'option', 'have', 'fast-forward', 'old-fashioned', 'VCR-style', 'bad', 'enough', 'own', 'player', 'only', '2x', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'available', 'making', 'process', 'annoying', 'put', 'extremely', 'mildly', 'expletive-free.In', 'short', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'DVD', 'aside', 'doubt', 'will', 'stand', 'up', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'most', 'people']",Lost in Translation

It was nice to see Bill Murray on the big screen once again. His scenes with the Japanese were hilarious, and the lost and confused looks on his face were priceless. Scarlett Johansson is such a great actress compared to other young (and even older) actresses these days. The two play Americans, both in somewhat troubled marriages, and both sleepless in Japan who meet up one night (and the nights after) and establish a close, intimate relationship, minus the sex--so are they having an affair? Don't know. It shows how two people can be so close yet not have sex involved to make the ""relationship"" work. However, the ending is pretty sad. Murray and Johansson make a good on screen team and their actions toward each other seem so natural.""Lost In Translation"" is a movie that you can relate to if you have travelled to a foreign country where everything around you was totally different from your usual lifestyle.

619406,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B00005JMJ4,Erica Anderson,"[9, 12]","I just came back from seeing ""Lost in Translation"". I was simply astounded by how well screenwriter/director Sophia Coppola was able to make a film that was both funny and poignant at the same time. The characters were deftly well-written. There were moments during the film when I thought the character of Bob Harris was strictly written for the constantly funny Bill Murray. For example, the brief scene where Bob goes golfing made me think of Bill in the hilarious ""Caddyshack"". And when Bob and Charlotte went to a karaoke bar with a bunch of friends of Charlotte's, I immediately thought of Bill doing his lounge act on SNL and singing the theme song to ""Star Wars"". Ironic? I didn't think so but if it was, it was unintentional and made the movie all the more special to me since I grew up on ""Caddyshack"" and ""Saturday Night Live"". I found the storyline of two strangers in a completely foreign country and somehow connecting with each other quite interesting. The writing in the film was compelling, and the score even more compelling. The music gave the film more depth and emotion. I thought that would have been too bloody predictable. Bill Murray was simply hilarious in this film. I loved it when he had an encounter with a hooker in the beginning in the movie and when he was on the stairmaster. Pure physical comedy at its finest. Bill's relationship with his wife is obvious based on the phone conversations he has with her. I love the sarcastic tone he uses in one of their conversations. Another great move on Sophia Coppola's part was having Scarlett Johansson play the disenchanted Charlotte. Although his role in the film is a bit brief, I enjoyed Giovanni Ribsi's role as the spouse who neglects Charlotte for his career as a rock and roll photographer. If there was one flaw in the film, I would have to say that it would be when Bob & Charlotte are chased out of a Japanese nightclub with a friend of Charlotte's. They were chased by someone who was shooting something that appeared to be pellets or bbs. I don't know but I found that scene completely unnecessary. Other than that scene, I loved ""Lost in Translation"". I truly got to see Bill shine as an actor in this film, both as a comedian as well as a drmatic actor. Scarlett Johanson also put in a wonderful performance in the film. Kudos to Sophia Coppola for the excellent writing and directing she contributed.

If you have the attention span of a squirrel, then do not rent or buy this film. If you have any sense of patience, allowing a film to organically unfold, you will be rewarded.Bill Murray is great, playing what I think is essentially himself. I think the core of the movie is his interaction with the Japanese people and culture, not the friendship/romance. The relationship with Scarlett Johanssen consists of them simply recreating together -- drinking, dancing, karaoke. Only in one scene is there any serious conversation between the two. Is there any *there* there? Not really. Johanssen doesn't have much to do, either, except mostly react to walking through Tokyo and Kyoto and staring out her hotel window.Still, the film doesn't take any wrong turns or destroy its credibility. It is just a quiet, sweet meditative little movie. Probably the great reviews and excess hype will work against it now. People will expect too much.And, I'm sorry, but the Japanese as depicted in this movie are just plain weird. From our point of view, inscrutable. So we have a good-natured and affectionate chuckle at their expense. Not having been to Japan, I cannot say how much the film exaggerates their strangeness. Even if this film is essentially accurate, I wonder if the Japanese themselves would be able to explain their behavior.

There really wasn't another film that overshadowed it by that much, but I'm not sure if it deserves quite the pinnacle acclaim that it is receiving.  It is a very good film though about the relationship between a B actor, Bill Murray, and a newlywed, Scarlett Johnasson, and the way they spend their sleepless nights in Tokyo.  It is beautifully shot by youngster Sofia Coppola following in her talented father's footsteps.  Murray and Johansson's relationship is exciting, intelligent, and incredibly plutonic.  It's about knowing that there are others like you in the world, and the satisfaction that that knowledge is supposed to bring.  Whether it does or not though, the film does not even try to answer.",4,What happens next?,1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,789,"['be', 'hit', 'movie', 'year', 'not', 'completely', 'surprise', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'overshadowed', 'much', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'quite', 'pinnacle', 'acclaim', 'receiving', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'relationship', 'B', 'actor', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'newlywed', 'Scarlett', 'Johnasson', 'way', 'spend', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'Tokyo', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'youngster', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'following', 'talented', 'father', 'footsteps', 'Murray', 'Johansson', 'relationship', 'exciting', 'intelligent', 'incredibly', 'plutonic', 'knowing', 'are', 'others', 'world', 'satisfaction', 'knowledge', 'supposed', 'bring', 'not', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'try', 'answer']",Lost in Translation

Sofia Coppola has created a film which is visually appealing, bringing to life the overwhelming nature of Tokyo as well as the stark contrast of cultures (culture shock). Unlike something culturally insensitive and disrespectful, like Mr. Baseball, which pokes fun at Japanese culture and way of life in an ugly effort to garner laughs, Coppola illustrates the differences without taking anything away from either culture. Two lonely Americans stuck in a Tokyo hotel, both contemplating their own lives, trying to make efforts in their interpersonal relationships, find each other and somehow find friendship and solace in their acquaintance. This, too, is something many films have tried to do (older man, younger woman), but they degenerate into lurid and unrealistic love affairs or somehow seem too familial (father-daughter, mentor-protege) in their portrayal. With excellent writing from Coppola and excellent performances from Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, the relationship is both believable and refreshing. Lines are not crossed, though there is tension between the two.Overall, I left the cinema feeling carried away by a mood, nostalgic for that sense of tension, nostalgic for Tokyo (or at least for that sense of being an outsider but finding acceptance with someone as uncomfortable or alone as I felt).",5,Mood,1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,1484,"['Largely', 'plotless', 'story', 'time', 'place', 'impression', 'acquaintance', 'strong', 'mood', 'built', 'subtle', 'images', 'stellar', 'fitting', 'soundtrack', 'superb', 'cast', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'created', 'film', 'visually', 'appealing', 'bringing', 'life', 'overwhelming', 'nature', 'Tokyo', 'as', 'well', 'stark', 'contrast', 'cultures', 'culture', 'shock', 'something', 'culturally', 'insensitive', 'disrespectful', 'Mr', 'Baseball', 'fun', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'way', 'life', 'ugly', 'effort', 'garner', 'laughs', 'Coppola', 'differences', 'taking', 'anything', 'away', 'culture', 'Two', 'lonely', 'Americans', 'stuck', 'Tokyo', 'hotel', 'contemplating', 'own', 'lives', 'trying', 'make', 'efforts', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'find', 'other', 'somehow', 'find', 'friendship', 'solace', 'acquaintance', 'too', 'something', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'tried', 'do', 'older', 'man', 'younger', 'woman', 'degenerate', 'lurid', 'unrealistic', 'love', 'affairs', 'somehow', 'seem', 'too', 'familial', 'father-daughter', 'mentor-protege', 'portrayal', 'excellent', 'writing', 'Coppola', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'relationship', 'believable', 'refreshing', 'Lines', 'are', 'not', 'crossed', 'tension', 'two.Overall', 'left', 'cinema', 'feeling', 'carried', 'away', 'mood', 'nostalgic', 'sense', 'tension', 'nostalgic', 'Tokyo', 'least', 'sense', 'being', 'outsider', 'finding', 'acceptance', 'someone', 'uncomfortable', 'alone', 'felt']",Lost in Translation

619413,A39UYGV94X1T2X,B00005JMJ4,ethan100,"[40, 43]",".One of the most interesting aspects of LIT is the market's reaction to it:  most of those who caught it in a theater loved it, and a great many who've seen it first on DVD are angry with it.Why?1) Well, the grouches are quite right--it's not much of a comedy, there's very little story, and the characters aren't going through giant transformations across the course of the film.  If you're sitting at home with your significant other or a bunch of friends, if you're talking, if the sound of crunching snacks in your head is louder than the soundtrack, if the lights are on or the phone rings, forget it, you're done--it's like visiting a zen rock garden with a GameBoy, and your only shot at liking this film is personally relating to what the characters have experienced, or if you've been to Tokyo.2) The rabid fans are quite right too--LIT is an ""experience"" film that is mismarketed as a Bill Murray comedy; it's all about sights and sounds, not story.  It lets you know this from the very first shot, a long, wordless look at, um, Scarlett Johansson, with a quietly rising and subsiding sound clip from Kevin Shields, the songwriter of the greatest lost band of last twenty years, My Bloody Valentine (if you don't know, YOU BETTER ASK SOMEBODY).  There's every chance this bombs at home, but in a theater, in the dark, with great sound and everybody shutting up, it works.That first shot sets the tone for LIT.  There's not a single jump cut or sudden burst of sound in the entire film--it's supposed to be a slow, alluring, engulfing experience; again, this is terrific in a theater, but it's a fragile spell, and it's easy to see why it might not work at home.3) The grouches are also right when they criticize the dialogue.  In literal terms, not a lot is being said.  If you don't attach to the characters at all, it isn't hard to start hating a young, pretty, apathetic whiner and a rich middle-aged whiner, both given the luxury of fretting full-time over existential problems, which, if you don't like the leads, seem pretty trivial.  It's not hard to see why that doesn't make for a fun movie night.4) The rabid fans can argue this one--LIT is very much about what's NOT said.Think about the most verbal characters in the film: they're babbling.  The sweetly inattentive husband is wildly inarticulate--he's perpetually distracted, and constantly interrupting his own train of thought.  The starlet (a snarky sendup of Cameron Diaz) grows more vapid by the sentence.  Bill Murray's wife is nothing but a telephone voice, transfixed by carpet swatches and bored by everything else.  And from the dead-serious commercial director to the ebulliently idiotic talk show host, there's no clear translation of the spoken Japanese.  For God's sake, when she over-emotes her way through Scarborough Fair, the lounge singer is a self-parody, unintentionally echoing Bill Murray's famous SNL parody of a lounge singer pouring out Scarborough Fair.  Every one of them is lost in translation.In a different way, so are Bob and Charlotte.  The reason LIT doesn't have a story is that the entire film is an interlude--two people who suddenly find themselves together, sharing a break from their lives.And they both seem to really need it--they're sick of the meaningless conversations and logistics that drive their worlds.  It's a classic use of the medium, to show the huge gap between what's said and what's seen.  Bob and Charlotte are wonderfully quiet and accepting of each other from the get go--they don't have talk much to connect.  If you watch for it, there's a silent shift in the film:  before she meets Bob, Charlotte is rattled by how numb she feels when she visits a temple and retreats to her hotel room, surrounding herself with junk media.  Before Bob meets Charlotte, he sleepwalks through his workday, producing junk media.  After they meet, when they spend time on their own, they wander wordlessly and beautifully alone:  Bob golfs by himself with Mt. Fuji in the distance, and Mt. Fuji floats by Charlotte on a Kyoto bullet train, as she heads off to visit another temple.  They're discovering a less bewildering, more personal Japan, and retrieving themselves as they do it.  And all this is shown, not spoken.5) The grouches have a point: nothing freaking happens in LIT.6) The fans answer:  yeah, exactly.  The key to the film is what doesn't happen between the characters.  It's no accident that LIT takes place in bustling, frenetic Tokyo, or that the main characters are hopelessly jetlagged and out of sync with everything except each other.  If that doesn't sink in early, then you'll miss the many charms of LIT, from the long, lovely shots, the sweet, spare exchanges between Bob and Charlotte, the gorgeously slow shoegazer/trip-hop/dream pop soundtrack (the best since Trainspotting, High Art,and Ms. Coppola's last film, the Virgin Suicides), and the electrifyingly silent ending.So, sorry if you hated this film.  Have a drink, maybe two, turn the off lights, don't talk, watch it again, and you might change your mind.(Oh, and if you take into account EVERY image of Japanese people in this film--the businesspmen and women, the artists, the florists, the crowds in the street, the surfers, the strippers, the monks, the bride and groom, the elderly patient, the doctor, etc.--it's harder to argue that LIT is an anti-Japanese film, and easier to see it for what it is:  an outsider's POV of a few silly and sublime experiences in an unfamiliar culture).",5,Why you love or hate this movie,1082332800,"04 19,

619414,A3OCYD37X2YTQ,B00005JMJ4,Eugene,"[1, 2]","I'll start off with a metaphor. If other movies are like diving in the pool, then Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is like floating on your back and staring up at the sun. It's a movie that doesn't try to impress or even engage the viewer. It exists on its own lifeline, and if you're willing to tag along, you'll be rewarded with an engrossing and endearing experience. Notice I said ""experience"", because that's what the movie is. There are no heavy plotlines, there is not a lot of dialogue. There only exists two central characters who are lonely and isolated in a foreign country falling in love. There is no hidden message behind the lush visuals and beautiful performances by the actors. There is no knee slapping hilarity or tear jerking sad moments, there is only rich and heavy emotion...the kind of emotion that you aren't sure exactly what you're feeling.Bill Murray stars as Bob Harris, a washed up actor who has been hired to endorse a Japanese whiskey company. Arriving in Tokyo to shoot some commercials, he is tired....of his job, of his life, and everyone around him. As fate would have it, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and her photographer husband are staying in the same hotel. Charlotte is a recent Yale graduate who is dissatisfied with her marriage and her direction in life. Meeting in the hotel bar, Bob and Charlotte slowly and gently fall in love, coming to terms with their own unhappiness with their lives.Sofia Coppola would've been a great music video director. And this time (maybe the only time), I mean that as a compliment. The visuals focus in and out of eachother, slowly panning over the amazing Japanese landscapes, both in the city and the country side. Throughout a large portion of the movie, there is virtually no dialogue. Yet you're still captivated by the way Coppola takes you from scene to scene, most notably in the beginning as Charlotte wanders her way through Tokyo into the more rural landscapes. These scenes say something about Charlotte's character, both wide eyed and aware, noticing and all encompassing, and most of all....appreciative. It builds up a kind of sympathy from the viewer on Charlotte being married to her callous and rude husband, John. Yet Coppola shows her skill in being able to switch gears quickly, as Bob's storyline involves a lot more subtle and hilarious humor, mostly from Bill Murray. We should make a note that Murray could've easily botched this role (or been the sole bad mark on the whole movie). But give him credit for never even approaching the edge of comedic shtick. He remains sad and desperate, a man whose job is to be other people that he doesn't even remember who he is. For probably one of the first times in his career, the humor comes from the movie, and not from him.I want to say one thing. Even without LOTR running against them, I doubt Lost in Translation would've even been given a second glance for Best Picture. It's just not that kind of movie. And once again, I have to stress how much credit Sofia Coppola should be given for not making it one of ""those kind of movies"", because she could have easily turned the star power and the fresh plot idea into a glitzy and heavier movie. But she keeps it gentle and subtle, which is obviously not for everyone. In fact, I heard the guy next to me completely doze off while watching it. And I could completely understand why. The movie is slow, it's deliberately slow. It's uninvolving, it's quiet, it's not a heart stopper in the least. But that's why it's so good.It's virtually impossible to explain much more about the movie. If you haven't already seen it, you may just wait til Tuesday and see the DVD. But I strongly suggest to you that you see it in the theaters before it's gone from it's post-nomination run....seeing it in the theater makes it more enveloping. It's thick and dense and fills the room, and you may find yourself gently smiling to yourself in parts where absolutely nothing is happening.I will leave you with this....another metaphor if you will. Lost in Translation is like the girl you're in love with, when she takes her hand and brushes your face. No kiss, no sex, nothing else. Just a small, simple touch.

For someone such as myself who passionately loathes the tedium and banality of mainstream Hollywood romantic comedies, Lost In Translation is a godsend. It doesn't waste time on a useless, predictable plot like so many romantic movies; this film is out to give the viewer an emotional experience. One thing I love is the way it's shot in a very realistic, almost documentary-like style. The characters feel like real people, not merely big stars who are just collecting a paycheck. The dialog feels truly genuine. That's what impressed me the most the first time I saw it. The dialog is real. It doesn't feel forced or phony and neither do the excellent performances. Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray are truly perfect in their roles as two lonely souls who find each other amid the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. The film tells us much about the characters using visuals. We see Bob and Charlotte spending time by themselves, searching for something or someone, perhaps. They meet and soon become friends, finding that they are in similar situations. In a place that is foreign to both of them, all they have is each other.In a typical Hollywood movie, things would be familiar and typical. There would be cheap jokes, predictable situations and obvious dialouge. Lost In Translation, however, always keeps things fresh. Bill Murray gives a splendid performance as the weary Bob Harris, who finds a real friend in Scarlett Johansson's lonely Charlotte. Sofia Coppola's direction is perfect. The film feels real. It never feels like a production. The characters feel just like real people. The backdrop of Tokyo forms a wonderful canvas for this story, and it is beautifully photographed.Lost In Translation is a wonderful film that is sure to delight viewers who are tired of phony Hollywood romance. The film never panders to audience expectations. It keeps things fresh, original, honest and genuine.

They are bored, somewhat depressed and unable to sleep.  They meet and become friends.  That's basically it.  The dialogue is boring.  The acting is boring.  The plot is boring.  The scenery of Japan is interesting to look at.  There were some (few) funny situations and lines in the movie but not enough to recommend this movie.  Scarlett Johansson does a good acting job with her character with what little she has to work with (lack of great dialogue and script).  But Bill Murray is NOT a good actor.  Bill Murray played himself in this movie.  How anybody could think he deserved to win a Golden Globe, be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor is beyond my comprehension.  Bill Murray should not be rewarded for playing himself in a movie.  The movie did not deserve to be nominated for Best Picture (Academy Award) and did not deserve to win Best Comedy (Golden Globe).  What happened to the film industry?  Have they lost touch with reality?  I actually had to force myself to finish watching this movie and could not wait until it was over.  That's not a good sign.  If you are the ""arty"" (art-house) type, you will probably like this movie.  But if you are an average/mainstream movie viewer, you probably won't like this movie unless you like boring, quirky films.  I am shocked that this movie has been given so much praise and rave reviews from a lot of critics.  I guess that's why I like this website because I think it can be a more accurate viewpoint for people with all kinds of different tastes.Just because a movie is considered a work of ""art"" doesn't mean it is appealing in any way or interesting enough to be a movie. It seems to me that this is becoming a trend now to make movies without anything really interesting going on.  It should at LEAST be interesting and maybe have something to say or have an impact on you in some way that you can't forget it.  I guess I put a lot of importance on a movie being interesting or entertaining so that I don't fall asleep.  Entertainment value is definitely very subjective and everybody has his or her own tastes.  I think it is VERY IMPORTANT to any movie to be interesting or entertaining enough that you would actually want to watch the movie again sometime.  I think most people would agree with me too.  This movie is NOT a great movie; not even a good movie.  Someone would have to pay me to watch this boring and irritating movie again.  I'd have to think about how much I'd charge.My rating:  D",2,For the art-house crowd only,1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,2623,"[""'ll"", 'try', 'make', 'review', 'short', 'NOT', 'sweet', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Charlotte', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'are', 'two', 'Americans', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'are', 'bored', 'somewhat', 'depressed', 'unable', 'sleep', 'meet', 'become', 'friends', 'basically', 'dialogue', 'boring', 'acting', 'boring', 'plot', 'boring', 'scenery', 'Japan', 'interesting', 'look', 'were', 'few', 'funny', 'situations', 'lines', 'movie', 'not', 'enough', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'good', 'acting', 'job', 'character', 'what', 'little', 'work', 'lack', 'great', 'dialogue', 'script', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'NOT', 'good', 'actor', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'played', 'movie', 'How', 'anybody', 'could', 'think', 'deserved', 'win', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'be', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'comprehension', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'rewarded', 'playing', 'movie', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Award', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'win', 'Best', 'Comedy', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'What', 'happened', 'film', 'industry', 'Have', 'lost', 'touch', 'reality', 'actually', 'had', 'force', 'finish', 'watching', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'was', 'over', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'are', 'arty', 'art-house', 'type', 'will', 'probably', 'movie', 'are', 'average/mainstream', 'movie', 'viewer', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'boring', 'quirky', 'films', 'am', 'shocked', 'movie', 'been', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'praise', 'rave', 'reviews', 'lot', 'critics', 'guess', 'why', 'like', 'website', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'viewpoint', 'people', 'kinds', 'different', 'tastes.Just', 'movie', 'considered', 'work', 'art', ""n't"", 'mean', 'appealing', 'way', 'interesting', 'enough', 'be', 'movie', 'becoming', 'trend', 'now', 'make', 'movies', 'anything', 'really', 'interesting', 'going', 'should', 'LEAST', 'be', 'interesting', 'maybe', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'have', 'impact', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'guess', 'put', 'lot', 'importance', 'movie', 'being', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'asleep', 'Entertainment', 'value', 'definitely', 'very', 'subjective', 'everybody', 'own', 'tastes', 'think', 'VERY', 'IMPORTANT', 'movie', 'be', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'would', 'actually', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'sometime', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'agree', 'too', 'movie', 'NOT', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'movie', 'Someone', 'would', 'have', 'pay', 'watch', 'boring', 'irritating', 'movie', 'again', ""'d"", 'have', 'think', 'how', 'much', ""'d"", 'charge.My', 'rating', 'D']",Lost in Translation

If I were to watch this movie before all the hype began to build I would have been giving you a 4 or 5 star review perhaps about how tragic this film entwines the characters but sadly when you put hype and Oscar nomination talk together it usually drowns out what might have been fun about the film in the first place. The film is brilliantly acted and it is really funny in places. As ever Bill Murray gets the best lines although Scarlett Johannsson does manage to get a few in herself and it does leave a distinct mark in your mindSo why 3 stars then? Well as I've said this film has completely been drowned out by all the critics' rave reviews of the film which is a shame really. What is understated could be passed off for underwhelming in some people's eyes. And I don't really blame them for thinking that. If this wasn't as talked about as it was - perhaps people could have enjoyed it a little more without some weight of expectation around itI am glad though that the film picked up an Oscar.

Though I don't speak much Japanese, I understood a few things here and there.I think this movie portrays Americans pretty well tho in a way. Before I went to Japan (I went with a group in high school) we were warned about 'culture shock', I never felt this the entire time I was there. There were things that were different or unexpected and difficult at times with my weak Japanese, but at the same time I am a very accepting person and adaptable.I have many different nationalities in my family including Black, Mexican, Japanese, and Filipino..so I kinda have to be accepting in order to get along with my family.***if you haven't seen the movie, maybe don't read this****The thing that kinda bugged me about the characters, was that they never even really tried to learn about the culture. I never saw them getting any books or trying to arrange a tour guide...all which would have been easy to do in a big city such as Tokyo. Bill Murray's character was a famous actor, he could have easily had a translator accompany him. I guess really now I think the movie wasn't about being lost in translation it was about being lost in life. These two people were lonely and lost and their connection was not only being White-Americans, it was also that they had problems in their marriages and weren't sure about their jobs.

619423,A2CPM6AEJHVNKL,B00005JMJ4,Found Highways,"[17, 18]","The first image in writer-director Sofia's Coppola's Lost in Translation gets your attention - -  Charlotte's behind in her underwear as she lies in bed.  Charlotte, barely out of her teens, is in her underwear most of the time she spends in the Tokyo hotel room where she waits for her photographer husband to notice her.You soon see that Charlotte's equally young husband is an idiot (insipid conversation about rock musicians, gullibility when a Sarah Michelle Gellar clone tells how her father fought on the &quot;American side at the Bay of Pigs&quot; and came back an anorexic).  While philosophy grad Charlotte is brighter than her husband, she shares one thing with him - -  she's no more emotionally mature than he is.In one scene Charlotte and her husband  (writing this, I can't remember his name) are in their hotel room.  He's sitting on the floor, surrounded by cameras and expensive photo equipment (his toys) while Charlotte wiggles past him in her underwear, throwing a scarf she's been knitting around her neck, playing dress-up.  &quot;Do you think this is done?&quot; she asks him.  He doesn't know.Lost in Translation is the story of Charlotte waiting to grow up, and finding someone to wait with her.Bob is an American movie star doing an ad campaign for Suntory whiskey in Tokyo.  His marriage is rocky, but he doesn't want it to end.  Bob and Charlotte meet.  They each recognize a soul mate.  But they also know from the beginning that it can't last.  Neither one wants to take advantage of the other.The comedy in the film comes from Bob's interaction with Japanese culture (sometimes verging on clich&eacute;).  The drama comes from Charlotte and Bob's desire for each other, along with the knowledge that, regardless of what happens in their marriages, they're not the ones for each other.Bill Murray as Bob deserves the Oscar for showing all this with his weary face.  Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte displays not just grown-up emotions, but the act of growing up as we watch.Tokyo, filmed mostly at night, seems like most big cities to be itself more than part of the country it belongs to.  We see the contrast when Charlotte comes across a traditional Japanese wedding outside the city, though you wonder if there's a reality for the Japanese somewhere between hypermodern Tokyo and re-creations of ancient religious ceremonies.Charlotte and Bob spend their nights together, fighting insomnia, running from one club or party to another.  The Japanese they talk to are mostly young, struggling to be understood in basic English and even French, in contrast with businessmen Bob overhears in the hotel sauna comfortably speaking German between themselves, but not experiencing anything of Tokyo.  (I think they were complaining there was no German food.)  The music is American and British.  Karaoke is everywhere - - even the American lounge singer in the hotel is more of a karaoke singer than a New York chanteuse.When they have to leave each other, Bob goes home to his family, while Charlotte walks into the Tokyo crowds, alone but confident.

It may not cover ethical issues, it is not outrageous or controversial...it is one of the most beautiful love stories ever. It is simple. It is perfect.The story is about two lonely people, in a place they don't connect with, with people they don't connect with. Bill Murray plays an actor past his prime who is in Japan making some cash by doing whisky adds. He is married, has kids, and forgets their birthdays. His wife does not say ""I Love You"" before she hangs up the phone when he calls her. He spends his sleepless nights hagning out in the bar of his over the top modern Japanese hotel having a drink.Scarlette Johanson plays Charlotte, she is married to a self-absorbed photographer who always leaves her alone in the over the top modern Japanese hotel.  She spends her sleepless nights hanging out in the bar having a drink, and staring out the window at the city of lights (I mean LOTS of lights, Tokyo puts Las Vegas to shame when it comes to lights).These two lost souls meet and form an unlikely friend/love bond. This is not a lustful bond on either of their parts. Their love is love in the truest sense of the word, pure and real.When I said this movie had 3 amazing talents, well the other would have to be Soffia Coppola.

Or if they're female they don't get the movie unless it has a bunch of overblown, hard-to-believe sappy romance. Don't get me wrong, every once in awhile I like to watch a brainless action movie too, or (even more seldom) a sappy romance, but most of the time I like my movies smart, and Lost in Translation is a smart movie. So it's really not surprising many people didn't like it.Most of the people who wrote positive reviews did get it: this movie isn't about people going somewhere, or accomplishing something. It's a snapshot of a few days in the lives of two very different people who are lonely, not only because they are in a very alien culture but because they are at crisis points in their lives, and they searching for human connection. I won't waste my time talking about people's allegations that the younger girl-older man thing was ""creepy"" or that it was immoral for Bill Murray's character and Scarlett Johannsen's character to spend time together because both characters are married. All I have to say about that is: it's the 21st century, y'all, and it's time to grow up. I thought this was a very intelligent, sensitive portrait of two people who the outside world would view as successful but who feel very lost and alone. Their relationship wasn't about sex or unrealistic sappy romance (the two things most movie romances are based on), but about two minds meeting and two people finding out they aren't as different from other people as they had thought. I don't know, maybe the movie is hard to understand if you've lived a completely straight-line, unexamined, unadventurous life. But I went through a crisis similar to the one experienced by Scarlett Johannsen's character when I was about her age, so I could totally understand where her character was coming from. I have also traveled overseas (including to Japan) so I understand what it's like to feel ""lost"" in a foreign culture, so far from your home. Since most Americans, especially those in the Midwest, have never been farther than 300 miles from Columbus or Grand Rapids or Milwaukee or wherever, I imagine the whole idea of foreign travel is a mystery to them.

In fact, I barely managed to sit through it.  I guess, I kept hoping a plot would actually appear.  The only movie I ever seen that was worse than this one (that I actually managed to see the whole thing) was the Batman & Robin movie with George Clooney.I wanted to watch it because of good marks that Hollywood and the critics gave it and sat down thinking this would be a great and moving movie.  But I found it utterly boring and struggled to watch it to the end.  The actors are usually wonderful in what they do(LOVED SJ in Girl With the Pearl Earring), but even they need something to work with.  Bill Murray is one of my favorites, but this was clearly not the venue for him.If the plot was about how hopeless and boring and meaningless life can be, then making a movie that was hopeless and boring and meaningless is not the way to go.  Tell a story, you silly people!!!!  This was a complete waste of time and film and the critics who love it so much need to seriously sit back and take stock of what makes a good plot and good characters and why we go to movies in the first place.

First, I know of no other film that captures &quot;jet lag&quot; and its mind-numbing physical effects on the weary traveler.  Second, she gives an example of detachment and the acute introspection that can result.  Bill Murray knows that much of what is being translated for him from Japanese is &quot;lost,&quot; thus resulting in truncated and unsatisfactory communication -- in fact, the absence of communication.  But it is not just the Japanese that alludes him. His interaction, even the long distance calls home, are misunderstood, taken out of context, void of meaning.  The central characters of this film find themselves in Japan and are forced to re-invent or perhaps re-discover themselves.  That is what this film is conveying.  Anyone who has travelled extensively, and faced the long nights away from home will recognize the way the mind works in such instances, will know that there are times when one is uncertain of understanding oneself, let alone the foreign tongues on all sides of you.

Not only did my mind wander, but I only got a cursory view of what the movie is about. I decided to give it another chance, and it was indeed a film that pulls you in. Having been to Tokyo myself, it was  a small dose of familiarity. This is a film that must be viewed a few times to really be appreciated.Bill Murray plays the role of Bob Harris, an actor who seems to be going through a mid-life crisis in both his career and marriage. Harris flies to Tokyo to film a commercial for Suntory Whisky, and seems not to enjoy the job too much, despite the healthy financial compensation. Scarlett Johhannsen plays the role of Charlotte, a young wife who tags along with her workaholic photographer husband. She appears to be neglected as a wife, and yearns for her husband's attention, and eventually, anyone's attention. Bored and feeling neglected, she ventures out of the confines of her hotel room, and into the pulsating, neon lit and mysterious atmosphere of Tokyo, a world unto itself. She not only enjoys the modern, contemporary side, but respects and appreciates the ancient and traditonal customs as well.A few nights later, unable to sleep, Charlotte heads down to the bar where Harris is having a nightcap, and the two instantly connect. I  think the reason for the connection was the fact that they sensed each other were lost, and at different crossroads in their own lives, and not so much the fact that they were both many miles from home. I believe the fact that the bar was filled with other Americans confirms this, at least from my own perspective. This movie should speak volumes to everyone, because we have, or will experience being ""Lost in Translation"" at some point in our lives. We will be Bob Harris or Charlotte, and will deal with our journeys in our own unique ways. Sometime, I feel like Bob Harris, and can definitely identify with him, but in my own way. It also demonstrates that even though many of our friendships may last for just a ""season"", they will be un forgettable.The two begin to explore the city's karaoke bars, districts and parties. One would probably interpret that there is something sexual about to occur here due to the chemistry between Bill and Charlotte, but that doesn't happen. However, when Charlotte knocks on Bob's door one morning and finds he is in the company of another woman, she is indeed offended, as if it were her own lover or husband. The ending is very special, as Bob, who could not wait to leave Japan at the beginning of the movie, suddenly finds himself dreading the trip back to the states and leaving Charlotte behind. I also think the location adds to the mystique of this great film. This will stay in my collection forever!

Moody, ethereal and meaningful, it presented a promising director and one to follow closely. With &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, her sophomore effort, similar gloomy and melancholic atmospheres persist, yet the movie doesn`t quite work and fails to impress.Sure, the idea of two lonesome individuals in a foreign land developing a peculiar relationship (friendship? love??) is somewhat enticing and could lead to a good introspective drama, still this cinematic experience drags too much and never seems to take off. Bill Murray plays, well, Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johansson is cute but far from excellent on her role.Trying to develop subjects like loneliness, communication and life choices, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; only suceeds in delivering an indulgent story with uninteresting characters, enticing cinematography, a well-crafted atmosphere and a very good soundtrack (Air (again), Death in Vegas, Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine`s Kevin Shields, and many others).This effort is a cheap way of discovering some places in Tokyo at night (offering a realistic, documentary-like style), but a movie should tell an absorbing story with memorable characters, and this one just falls flat.

Their respective spouses don't understand them-natch-and the foreign world around them has better things to do than to coddle their poor alienated selves.But writer and director Sofia Coppola's story goes wonderfully right.Bob Harris (Bill Murray at his leathery best) is a middle-aged actor, lodged at a luxury hotel in Tokyo for a week to shoot commercials (make a trip to japander.com and see if your favorite actors have done the same). Drowning his insomnia and his cultural befuddlement at the hotel bar, he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johanson), a woman so young you can practically feel the peach fuzz on her smooth cheeks. While Bob is jaded at best with his dutiful calls to wife and kids and his nightly whiskey binges, Charlotte is downright unhappy. Spending day after day alone in a luxury suite while her photog hubby John (Giovanni Ribisi) is out shooting rock bands, she is as mystified by her marriage as by the Japanese.The way Bob and Charlotte's tender relationship unfolds is easily one of the most thoughtfully crafted and believable love stories that has flickered across the screen in years. Told in beautifully understated tones, it has the viewer wondering at every turn where this romance can or should rightly go. In the end, we find that the characters knew the answer all along, and it is their ultimate sagacity that allows us to relate to the bittersweet story from start to finish: there is no disbelief to suspend.Still, the movie is not entirely free of problems. No one is going to dispute that modern Japanese pop culture is a riot-Tokyo is William Gibson's muse for good reasons-and it's OK to say so. But as Murray's typically wry comments (verbally and otherwise) on the seeming madness surrounding the foreign traveler pile up, the unpleasant image of the smug American looking down on the rest of the world may take shape in some viewers' eyes. I've heard it argued that it really isn't unjustified to shake one's head at Japanese idiosyncrasies.

It's also Bill Murray's best performance.  He is nothing short of amazing playing a has-been actor with whom the Japanese are still infatuated.The story takes place over a week period in Tokyo as we are introduced to Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte, played with much maturity by Scarlet Johannson.  They are both stuck in a culture they don't understand and marriages they aren't sure are working anymore.  Charlotte's husband (Giovanni Ribisi) is a photographer who is always on a shot and leaves her in the hotel to fend for herself.She wanders around Tokyo and Bob keeps himself in the hotel bar where Charlotte finally bumps into him and a friendship is slowly developed.  This friendship saves them from the aching loneliness visually displayed by Sofia in long, beautiful shots of Johannson sitting in the hotel window looking out over the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo and Murray trying to find anything on Japanese television he can connect with.Don't get me wrong.  This is not a downer movie.  It is one of such various and vast emotions that I'm surprised Sofia fits them in to one little movie.  There are moments of great laughter and joviality such as the ""gift"" that is sent to Bob's room.  But even when when Charlotte and Bob's adventure begins it is quite apparent they are still not truly happy especially when they end up at a Karaoke bar and you get to see Murray's character singing Roxy Music's heart-breaking ""More Than This"".Some people may find the slight fun poking at the Japanese a little too much, but it's meant to show just how different their culture and ours are so different.  A few scene are down right gut-busting and others just drive the character's actions as they try to something to hold on to they can identify with.

619469,A183RGDCCC913M,B00005JMJ4,"Hugh S. Welsh ""starmer welshmeister""","[8, 15]","Francis Ford Coppola was a directorial gold mine in the '70s, fashioning such landmark cinema as ""The Conversation,"" the first two episodes of ""The Godfather"" and what I roundly consider a bonafide cinematic gem, ""Apocalypse Now,"" only to fade from memory with the onrush of the '80s.These days, Coppola is semiretired from filmmaking in lieu of garnering up the reins to producing. As executive producer to such cracks at, as my faithful film companion puts it, crap - he raked in the greenback for ""Jeepers Creepers"" along with ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" - it makes one ponder whether Coppola's mind is gradually withering not unlike Colonel Kurtz's.On the contrary, as one Coppola mind dissolves into non-being, another has sprung from the smoldering familial ember. This individual is none other than his tremendously gifted daughter, Sophia Coppola.In her most recent film, ""Lost in Translation,"" the Coppola progeny has engineered an aesthetic marvel of a motion picture. In a medium bungled by editing and cinematic relapse, Sophia Coppola has flung at the silver screen a movie that trounces convention. Thematically, ""Lost in Translation"" reads like a Saul Bellow novel; although effervescent with comedic spunk, therein lies a spiritual configurative that is the true heartbeat to the film.Bill Murray portrays Bob Harris, a MacGyver-esque has-been who, due to his overriding celebrity status overseas, is offered a sum in the seven-digit range to endorse a whiskey product with a Japanese label. He accepts the proposal and sees the month-long engagement in Tokyo as an opportunity to slip away from the day-to-day obligation of a father/husband.In spite of being treated as a demigod by the East Asian peoples, Harris can't slow the onset of midlife crisis. Sure, he adores his children and still feels a sliver of compassion for his wife, but the pruning effect of age is taking its toll physically and emotionally.The luster of yesteryear has blended into the horizon for Harris, who extracts whatever grain of esteem he can while crouched over on a barstool slurping the very booze upon which he glosses his signature.Fortunately for Harris, a magnum opus of beauty and charm is around the bend. The feminine masterwork is a soul-searching Yale graduate, Charlotte, expertly depicted by cinematic newbie Scarlett Johansson.She, like Harris, is dejected by the insipidness that steadily encompasses her. For instance, her fashion photographer of a husband has neither the time nor the ardor to suit her needs. He cares more about the coloration of a studio backdrop than her yearnings for attention.Eventually, Harris and Charlotte strike up casual conversation to the tune of a tangy rendition of ""Scarborough Fair,"" and what unfolds from there is a romantic escapade that would flutter the pulse of even your most loveless dope. It is a platonic courtship that truly tweets like a Beethoven symphony.

It is such an inviting opportunity to trash this movie -- as critics trashed Sofia Coppola's acting, in her role as Mary Corleone in father Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather, Part III"" -- because the director is the beneficiary of her father's nepotism.  Well, that is undoubtedly true, but I honestly think she made the grade with this alright movie. (To go out further on a limb, even though her acting was not good in Godfather III, she was believable as Michael Corleone's daughter. I don't necessarily think that would have been the case with Coppola's first choice, Wynona Ryder, even though Ryder is a better actress). Thankfully, nepotism exists, because I think without it, this movie could never have been made. Although it is indeed a worthwhile movie, there are way more talented people out there than Sofia Coppola who can't even get that so-called ""friend of the independents,"" Robert Redford, to give them the time of day.The movie revolves around Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), an oddly matched pair, alienated from the superficial glitz and glam of the Tokyo film and fashion world. Like two lost children caught in a snowstorm, they find each other, and seek warmth and meaning in their friendship. Through random meetings and seeing the sights of Tokyo, they end their time together a little stronger to face the world.A number of reviewers criticized this flick because ""nothing happens."" No, nothing ""momentous"" does happen; that is not the point. ""Lost in Translation"" is a quietly told story of, to paraphrase Thoreau, two souls living in quiet desperation. Which is exactly why this story takes place in Tokyo. All right, ""they're in the middle of Tokyo, and all they do is stare at the walls."" Precisely. They are depressed people, and often, depressed people are more intelligent than those around them. They need cerebral stimulation, not merely the obvious sensorial stimulation offered by the Ginza's fury of neon.Most certainly, I was thinking Bill Murray was nuts for not having an affair with the ethereally beautiful Johansson (who is my second choice candidate for playing Madeleine, if a remake of ""Vertigo"" is in the offing; my first is Kirsten Dunst). Yet, many of us have had a friendship that, even though both parties are interested sexually, is far too precious for sex to intrude upon. A paradox, I know, but true nonetheless.The film had a minimalistic, beautiful story, played by both actors with insight and understatement. I give the actors 4-1/2 stars.That said, this was hardly a cinematic feast.  My reaction to the cinematography was simply neutral. It makes for a better play than movie. Some people are tossing the phrase ""Italian Neorealism"" around rather haphazardly. Please!  As a piece of film, ""Lost in Translation"" is to ""The Bicycle Thief"" or ""Stromboli"" what ""Body Heat"" is to ""Double Indemnity"" and ""White Heat."" Close, but no cigar. As a work of cinema, I give it 1-1/2 stars. Thus, 3 on balance.Nevertheless, I hope to see more of Sofia Copolla's movies.

With `Lost In Translation', we have the unique pleasure of watching three such talents bloom and find themselves. The first one is, of course, director Sofia Coppola, daughter of the grand master Francis Ford, and a proud collaborator in the family business. `Lost In Translation' is only her second feature film, but all the promises made by her debut, the acclaimed `Virgin Suicides', is fulfilled in this movie. Though it shares with its predecessor a kind of drowsy, atmospheric slowness, `Lost In Translation' is a much better structured movie, and shows Sofia truly on her way as both director and writer. It earned her an Oscar for best original screenplay, and golden globes for best screenplay and best film (comedy / musical).The second is young actress Scarlett Johansson. I had my eye on Scarlett since I saw her in two of my favorite films of recent years - Terry Zwigoff's `Ghost World' and the Coen Brothers' `The Man Who Wasn't There'. She played supporting roles in both movies, yet I was still impressed, and not just because of her young age (in `Ghost World' she plays a highschool graduate along with Thora Birch, yet she is two years younger than Birch - she was only 16 when the movie was made!) This year, though, we can see her in two leading roles - in `Lost In Translation' and `Girl With Pearl Earring' - and in `Lost In Translation', she really proves that she's a talent to be reckoned with.The third is - yes, that's right, Bill Murray. So, yes, he's been around for nearly a quarter of a century now, but we never really thought of him as much of an actor, right? Good though he was in `Ghostbusters' and `Groundhog Day', never before have I imagined him to be anything more than a comedian actor, and capable of playing a lead dramatic character successfully.

619476,AL2VDE4LO4ESR,B00005JMJ4,"Jack Fitzgerald ""JFD""","[8, 10]","I enjoyed Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" and would recommend the film to those who have lived abroad, especially in Japan.The story involved Bill Murray's character, a washed-up actor in Tokyo to film a Suntory whiskey commercial for $2 million, and his bouts with insomnia, loneliness and questioning of his mid-life existence. He meets another lost soul, played by the up-and-coming actress Scarlett Johansen, and they have a brief, chaste, yet intimate friendship. She's stuck in the hotel where they are living while her photographer husband is out working.Much of the action takes place in their upscale Tokyo hotel, but there are some interesting scenes in surreal bars, clubs, apartments, karaoke boxes and a hospital.Having lived in Japan, I found that Coppola captured much of the intitial culture shock experienced by those new to the country. There is the dazzle of neon lights, indecipherable language, and over-stimulation of music, noise and hordes of people.I found the range of characters and their English language abilities to be fairly accurate, although I think the doctor at the hospital might have had a better understanding.If you're expecting a fast-paced film full of action and humor, this may not be the film for you. It is a subtle, nuanced, deliberate tale, with lots of lingering shots of details and on the characters looking out windows and thinking. It is definitely ""directed"" but I think that Coppola did an effective job. Murray's performance, against type, was also outstanding. Johansen has an engaging smile.I haven't read any other reviews, but I imagine that if one hasn't experienced what these characters are going through, you just might not get it.

This is the rarest of the rare, a true comedy of manners, impeccably done, poking fun at two different cultures. It is sweet, incisive, sardonic, illuminating, morose, funny and sad. Bill Murray is a genius. There is no other actor I can think of who could have pulled off his role. Marlon Brando maybe. The character of Bob Harris is achingly real. When Murray was younger I always wondered if he would ever be able to completely immerse himself in a character without showing flashes of his Bill Murray persona. The answer is yes, he can. It is amazing just to watch him act in this movie. But everyone is good. Who knew that Anna Faris could act? Scarlett Johansson is excellent. Giovanni Ribisi is always strong, but in this movie, like Murray, he disappears into his role. Great work.For those of you who don't get this movie, I understand why you don't get it, but this is an absolutely brilliant movie. One of the best movies ever made. If you think this movie is boring, you do not yet understand what life is about. Hint, it's really not about car chases.

The dialogue in this movie was mediocre; in fact, there was barely any dialogue at all.  If people think watching Bill Murray do a few dozen takes for a whiskey commercial for Japanese TV is some profound or even humorous commentary on media, commercials, the ""hidden life"" of the mid-level Hollywood movie star, the American audience is even less sophisticated than I think.  If watching a Japanese director trying to communicate in incomprehensible English what he wants his American actor to do during a commercial, one might as well bring back every antedeluvian vaudeville joke and plant them in contemporary films for back-up.  Equally woeful is Murray's forgettable counterpart, who with equal ennui, awaits her husband's photo assignment to be over as she wiles away the time in her Tokyo hotel room.  They both meet; they act wan and ironic together, and you get the point of the movie in the first 20 minutes.  I believe Frances Coppola's daughter directed this; she also directed ""The Virgin Suicides,"" an equally banal movie, whose most interesting feature was watching how far up James Woods could hitch up his belt to make himself look like a goofy middle-aged bank clerk.

619482,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JMJ4,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[4, 6]","This film is surprising, surprisingly slow, surprisingly uneventful. Nothing happens, or rather no action whatsoever happens in the whole film. Don't be a middle-aged or advanced middle-aged man staying in Japan for a few professional days. This will lead to some boring experience. The poor man is taken care of by his boss and is provided with some female entertainment who titillates him and tries to make him rape her : phantasms are the target and tool of the  professional  woman. But then that poor man enables us to review the fate of this type of men : they are travelling for their professions, they are away from their families most of the time, they are the distant husbands - which satisfies the wife who retreated into motherhood -, they frustrate their children and develop with them a relation based on absence and estrangement, etc. They happen here and there to let themselves get involved in the hunt of some women (the women are the hunters), in this case an American singer in the hotel. They are also moved by some younger women who are also estranged from their husbands who are around but working on location as photographers or anything else. And that's the main interest of the film. The age gap is so important that there will be no passionate sexual exploration, but rather a highly sophisticated even cultured exploration of emotions and nothing but emotions. Ms Coppola goes against the grain that considers that these older men are predators and that these younger women are willing explorers of the human jungle. The passion, if indeed it is a passion, that develops here is purely platonic and shows that the man, as well as the woman, are looking for companionship and soul or spiritual exchange. The depth of this relation is shown in the accidental final goodbye scene. The man is playing father more than lover to the woman, and incest, remember, is rejected by all sane men and women. Temptation maybe, but a fruit that will never be plucked. This vision is definitely feminine and it shows that the younger woman might be led into yielding, maybe. She might not resist if the man were insistant. But Ms Coppola imagines a man who is not insistant and projects her desire or her knowledge, who knows which, to meet such older men, father figures that would not be insistant and try to become lovers. A fine film both about the real world and about the world Ms Coppola would like to meet. A crisscrossing patchwork of reality and dream, and you will never find out where each one starts and each one ends.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Professionals lost in exotic globalized environments,1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,2564,"['film', 'surprising', 'surprisingly', 'slow', 'surprisingly', 'uneventful', 'Nothing', 'rather', 'action', 'whatsoever', 'whole', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'middle-aged', 'advanced', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'staying', 'Japan', 'few', 'professional', 'days', 'will', 'lead', 'boring', 'experience', 'poor', 'man', 'taken', 'care', 'boss', 'provided', 'female', 'entertainment', 'who', 'tries', 'make', 'rape', 'phantasms', 'are', 'target', 'tool', 'professional', 'woman', 'then', 'poor', 'man', 'review', 'fate', 'type', 'men', 'are', 'travelling', 'professions', 'are', 'away', 'families', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'distant', 'husbands', 'wife', 'who', 'retreated', 'motherhood', 'frustrate', 'children', 'develop', 'relation', 'based', 'absence', 'estrangement', 'etc', 'happen', 'here', 'there', 'let', 'get', 'involved', 'hunt', 'women', 'women', 'are', 'hunters', 'case', 'American', 'singer', 'hotel', 'are', 'also', 'moved', 'younger', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'estranged', 'husbands', 'who', 'are', 'around', 'working', 'location', 'photographers', 'anything', 'else', 'main', 'interest', 'film', 'age', 'gap', 'so', 'important', 'will', 'be', 'passionate', 'sexual', 'exploration', 'rather', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'even', 'cultured', 'exploration', 'emotions', 'nothing', 'emotions', 'Ms', 'Coppola', 'grain', 'older', 'men', 'are', 'predators', 'younger', 'women', 'are', 'willing', 'explorers', 'human', 'jungle', 'passion', 'indeed', 'passion', 'here', 'purely', 'platonic', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'woman', 'are', 'looking', 'companionship', 'soul', 'spiritual', 'exchange', 'depth', 'relation', 'shown', 'accidental', 'final', 'goodbye', 'scene', 'man', 'playing', 'father', 'more', 'lover', 'woman', 'incest', 'remember', 'rejected', 'sane', 'men', 'women', 'Temptation', 'maybe', 'fruit', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'plucked', 'vision', 'definitely', 'feminine', 'younger', 'woman', 'might', 'be', 'led', 'yielding', 'maybe', 'might', 'not', 'resist', 'man', 'were', 'insistant', 'Ms', 'Coppola', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'insistant', 'projects', 'desire', 'knowledge', 'who', 'meet', 'such', 'older', 'men', 'father', 'figures', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'insistant', 'try', 'become', 'lovers', 'fine', 'film', 'real', 'world', 'world', 'Ms', 'Coppola', 'would', 'like', 'meet', 'crisscrossing', 'patchwork', 'reality', 'dream', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'one', 'starts', 'one', 'ends.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Lost in Translation

619484,A1A535W556ROBQ,B00005JMJ4,James Ferguson,"[2, 4]","The opening credits focus lovingly on Scarlett Johansson's rump as she lies in bed.  We follow her as she gets up to look out the window of the Tokyo hotel room, focusing on a facsimile of the Empire State Building.  Bill Murray is introduced with much greater fanfare, as he arrives at the hotel in a shiny black limousine with the lights of the porte-cochere reflecting off the windshield.  He is in town to do a commercial for Santori whiskey.  An aging actor whose draw seems to be mostly in Japan.  Coppola takes her time in bringing these two actors together.  At first a fleeting glance, then seeing each other in the lounge.  They seem to come together out of boredom more than anything else.  The movie initially has the melancholy tone of Leaving Las Vegas, but Coppola takes a warmer look at her characters.  She doesn't let the film devolve into pathos, but keeps it relatively light an airy, as the characters embark on a whirlwind tour of Tokyo, led by an intrepid Japanese guide.The film offers a wonderful assemblage of Tokyo life replete with Murray taking a picture-perfect swing on a long fairway with Mount Fuji rising in the distance.  Coppola makes no effort to translate the swirl of language around these characters.  Murray bemused that by the truncated translations of the commercial director's instructions.Both characters find themselves in dead end marriages.  Murray has been plugging along for 25 years, sticking it out for no other reason it seems than for his kids.  While Johansson has only recently been married to a fashion photographer who seems to have little time for her. Rather than be a tag-a-long, she spends her time wandering around Tokyo in search of some intrinsic value, momentarily seeming to sense it in a traditional wedding she spies upon.Mostly, she seems to be wanting reassurance, which she was unable to get when she calls her parents.  Enter Murray's world-weary personage.  It is really a shame Bill Murray didn't win an Oscar for this role.  It was a beautifully understated performance that showed what a consumate actor he is.  Johansson more than holds her own to Murray, making her mark in this movie.  But, what holds this movie together is the remarkably sensitive camera work.  Sofia Coppola is a very gifted director, able to see so much in subtle details and drawing the most from her actors, which she first exhibited in The Virgin Suicides.",5,Hotel at the end of the universe,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,2410,"['opening', 'credits', 'focus', 'lovingly', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'rump', 'bed', 'follow', 'up', 'look', 'out', 'window', 'Tokyo', 'hotel', 'room', 'focusing', 'facsimile', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'introduced', 'much', 'greater', 'fanfare', 'hotel', 'shiny', 'black', 'limousine', 'lights', 'porte-cochere', 'reflecting', 'off', 'windshield', 'town', 'do', 'commercial', 'Santori', 'whiskey', 'aging', 'actor', 'draw', 'be', 'mostly', 'Japan', 'Coppola', 'time', 'bringing', 'two', 'actors', 'together', 'first', 'fleeting', 'glance', 'then', 'seeing', 'other', 'lounge', 'seem', 'come', 'together', 'boredom', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'movie', 'initially', 'melancholy', 'tone', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Coppola', 'warmer', 'look', 'characters', ""n't"", 'let', 'film', 'devolve', 'pathos', 'relatively', 'light', 'airy', 'characters', 'embark', 'whirlwind', 'tour', 'Tokyo', 'led', 'intrepid', 'Japanese', 'guide.The', 'film', 'wonderful', 'assemblage', 'Tokyo', 'life', 'replete', 'Murray', 'taking', 'picture-perfect', 'swing', 'long', 'fairway', 'Mount', 'Fuji', 'rising', 'distance', 'Coppola', 'effort', 'translate', 'swirl', 'language', 'characters', 'Murray', 'bemused', 'truncated', 'translations', 'commercial', 'director', 'instructions.Both', 'characters', 'find', 'dead', 'end', 'marriages', 'Murray', 'been', 'plugging', 'along', '25', 'years', 'sticking', 'out', 'other', 'reason', 'kids', 'Johansson', 'only', 'recently', 'been', 'married', 'fashion', 'photographer', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'time', 'Rather', 'be', 'tag-a-long', 'time', 'wandering', 'around', 'Tokyo', 'search', 'intrinsic', 'value', 'momentarily', 'seeming', 'sense', 'traditional', 'wedding', 'upon.Mostly', 'be', 'wanting', 'reassurance', 'was', 'unable', 'get', 'when', 'parents', 'Enter', 'Murray', 'world-weary', 'personage', 'really', 'shame', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'role', 'was', 'beautifully', 'understated', 'performance', 'showed', 'what', 'consumate', 'actor', 'Johansson', 'more', 'own', 'Murray', 'making', 'mark', 'movie', 'what', 'movie', 'together', 'remarkably', 'sensitive', 'camera', 'work', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'very', 'gifted', 'director', 'able', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'subtle', 'details', 'drawing', 'most', 'actors', 'first', 'exhibited', 'Virgin', 'Suicides']",Lost in Translation

Its something different from the usual film.  Lost in Translation centers around lonliness, the longing to belong, and cultural differeces which can cause some problems.  Bill Murray is fantastic as the aging actor Bob Harris.  He fills the character with a charm that you cannot get enough of.  Bill Murray really does deserve the Best Actor Oscar.  Scarlett Johansson is awesome as a neglected wife who finds joy in life when she meets Bob Harris.  She really should have gotten a Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress nomination.  Last, but not least, to mention is Sofia Coppla.  As the director, she did a great job and it shows with all the hype that has surrounded the film.Bob Harris WAS a movie actor.  Now as his popularity has fallen in America, he is hired in Japan, where he is still a star, to shoot commercials and photos for Suntory, a whiskey company.  He is obviously not having a good time due to frequent calls and complaints from his wife and the lack of sleep. Charolette has come to Japan with her photographer husband and spends almost all of her time in the hotel.  She is lonely from the lack of excitement around her and the neglect she gets from her husband, who cares more about his job.The two meet when Charolette is dining with her husband and his actress friend who is a complete-never-stops-talking moron.  She has a brief conversation with him and we feel the warmth.  At their next meeting, she invites him to go see her Japanese friends with her.  With this experience with see how well they connect and we wish we had the same thing with someone.Lost in Translation is a fantastic film that is funny and somewhat sad at the same time.  This is a great movie that everyone should see because it is so enjoyable.  Bill Murray truly rocks and is so alluring with his comidic and dramatic acting.

619486,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00005JMJ4,James Hiller,"[2, 4]","Amidst all of the big Hollywood blockbusters late last year, there premiered a small, quiet little film that nearly blew all other films out of the water. Now, as Oscar season rolls around, there seems to be great emphasis on this film and deservedly so. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; was one of the best films released last year, and quite possibly, over the course of several years.The plot initially seems bland or blase; a washed-up movie star visits Tokyo to do a liquor commercial, and meets an attractive girl in a bar. So what makes this film so special?First, the talent of Bill Murray.  Murray simply steals this movie and makes it his own. As Bill Harris, Murray drips sadness, bewilderment, and approachibility with every scene. He somehow drops his comic guard and allows us in, living with him this incredible foreign experience. We are with him every step of the way, and understand him totally. Adding to the mixture is the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, who mirrors Murray's performance perfectly. The two leads could not have been better suited for these roles.Second, the script rocks. Both characters at different times in their lives ooze a loneliness that's brought out in the hustle and bustle of modern day Japan. They reach out to each other in thier loneliness, in an attempt to make human contact with another like soul. Although both characters are married, it's never threatening, and you come to understand their motives. All of this is emphasized with the second theme running through the movie, a fish out of water in the country of Japan. The results are both hilarious and introspective, and perfect.But what really makes this movie shine is the many, many, many moments of perfect quietness that speak essential truths. The lonely sound of bells ringing as Murray stands heads above each person in the elevator. The underwater exercise class. Charlotte walking across the pond on circular stones. Bill sitting alone in the bar. Charlotte being pulled into a flower arranging class. You may appreciate one or two of these moments, but this film is loaded with them. They allow this film to breathe; breathe life into the plot, the characters, and breathe life into ourselves.Lost in Translation is a remarkable film from a remarkable first time director.

Two seemingly-opposite Americans - Bob, a former film star reduced to shooting whiskey commercials, and Charlotte, a young wife ""forgotten"" by her husband - happen to meet in the same Tokyo hotel, and, despite the fact that Bob could theoretically be Charlotte's father, they find much-needed comfort in each other as together they explore Japanese society.  For those who know a bit about Japanese culture, the film takes on additional meanings, or at least the diverse elements of Japanese society are less foreign.The film takes place almost entirely in Tokyo, which is great, but there is also so much more that Japan can offer that it is a great downfall of the film that so little time is spent elsewhere - and this is seemingly just to show the conventional shot of Mount Fuji, as the core ""action"" of the time away from Tokyo could very easily have been done at a shrine in or near Japan's capital city.Unfortunately, Bill Murray (Bob) comes across as being extremely stiff throughout virtually the entire film, even in the ""lighter"" moments.  Yet, this also works well, a visual representation of just how ""lost"" Bob feels in Japan - compounded by events back home.The cinematography is beautiful, portraying Tokyo quite nicely - especially at night.  What is most surprising is the sheer pervasiveness of handheld shots throughout the film, subtly disorienting the (Western) viewer in relation to this (foreign) society.Unfortunately, due to two scenes of sexual content, Lost in Translation was given an ""R"" rating.  While these scenes certainly are realistic in terms of Japanese culture, they are entirely unnecessary and highly atypical of the rest of the film - and of the ""relationship"" between Bob and Charlotte.The primary downfall of the DVD, however, is the set of previews - more than five minutes of material which cannot be skipped.  The best Universal will allow is to fast-forward through these trailers.In the end, Lost in Translation is a wonderful film, and one which needs to be in the collection of everyone who has any connection with Japan - by blood, by friendship, or simply be appreciation.",4,"Excellent, but Too Focused on Tokyo",1091836800,"08 7, 2004",2004,2214,"['Lost', 'Translation', 'relatively', 'slow-paced', 'film', 'quite', 'interesting', 'nonetheless', 'Two', 'seemingly-opposite', 'Americans', 'Bob', 'former', 'film', 'star', 'reduced', 'shooting', 'whiskey', 'commercials', 'Charlotte', 'young', 'wife', 'forgotten', 'husband', 'happen', 'meet', 'same', 'Tokyo', 'hotel', 'fact', 'Bob', 'could', 'theoretically', 'be', 'Charlotte', 'father', 'find', 'much-needed', 'comfort', 'other', 'together', 'explore', 'Japanese', 'society', 'who', 'know', 'bit', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'film', 'additional', 'meanings', 'least', 'diverse', 'elements', 'Japanese', 'society', 'are', 'less', 'foreign.The', 'film', 'place', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Tokyo', 'great', 'also', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Japan', 'can', 'offer', 'great', 'downfall', 'film', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'elsewhere', 'seemingly', 'just', 'show', 'conventional', 'shot', 'Mount', 'Fuji', 'core', 'action', 'time', 'away', 'Tokyo', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'shrine', 'Japan', 'capital', 'city.Unfortunately', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Bob', 'being', 'extremely', 'stiff', 'virtually', 'entire', 'film', 'even', 'lighter', 'moments', 'Yet', 'also', 'well', 'visual', 'representation', 'just', 'how', 'lost', 'Bob', 'feels', 'Japan', 'compounded', 'events', 'back', 'home.The', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'portraying', 'Tokyo', 'quite', 'nicely', 'especially', 'night', 'What', 'most', 'surprising', 'sheer', 'pervasiveness', 'handheld', 'shots', 'film', 'subtly', 'disorienting', 'Western', 'viewer', 'relation', 'foreign', 'society.Unfortunately', 'due', 'two', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'content', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'was', 'given', 'R', 'rating', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'are', 'realistic', 'terms', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'are', 'entirely', 'unnecessary', 'highly', 'atypical', 'rest', 'film', 'relationship', 'Bob', 'Charlotte.The', 'primary', 'downfall', 'DVD', 'however', 'set', 'previews', 'more', 'five', 'minutes', 'material', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'skipped', 'best', 'Universal', 'will', 'allow', 'fast-forward', 'end', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'wonderful', 'film', 'one', 'be', 'collection', 'everyone', 'who', 'connection', 'Japan', 'blood', 'friendship', 'simply', 'be', 'appreciation']",Lost in Translation

Fortunately, this time around he has received richly deserved accolades for his performance.""Lost in Translation"" essentially follows Bob Harris (Murray) and Charlotte  (Scarlett Johansson), as they both find themselves lost and adrift in Japan. Bob is a fading action star, who apparently is past his heyday and takes a job promoting a Japanese liquor for $2 million. Little hints along the way indicate he probably could use the money. It appears he has been appearing in plays and probably making decent but not necessarily great money. His wife is on a remodeling binge, which seems to hint at the fact that the big paycheck is something she has looked forward to. But Bob is more troubled by his life in general than by financial matters. He feels disconnected from his wife and children and can't seem to find a way to re-connect with them. He's in the midst of a midlife crisis and has no idea what to do about except withdraw into himself.Charlotte is in somewhat similar straits. She is questioning her two-year marriage to a photographer who has brought her along to Japan for a shoot but he is gone much of the time. She feels no connection to her husband and, worse, doesn't know what she is supposed to do with her life.Bob and she eventually meet and become friends. soul mates in fact, and writer/director Sophia Coppola wisely avoids what nearly any other writer and director would have done with the relationship-throw them in bed together. Instead the two develop a far more intimate relationship as they wander Tokyo and face an impending separation when Bob must return to America.This is very much a thinking person's film. There's no real action (well, at one point they are chased out of a bar by a bartender toting some kind of weird gun) but you remain engrossed. The two leads give incredibly nuanced performances. Murray in particular is brilliant in his restraint, as on more than a few occasions he has the opportunity to revert to his standard goofy/funny guy act and doesn't.This is one of the best films I have seen in the past year.

619492,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00005JMJ4,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[3, 6]","""Lost In Translation"" is a pleasant interlude of a film, far removed from the typical blockbuster filled with violence and  and too much action with too little substance. This movie is character driven, with lots of atmosphere - but be warned, the movie is not long on plot. Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this wry, poignant comedy of kindred souls - middle-aged Bob Harris, (Bill Murray), and 25 year-old philosophy graduate Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) - as they wend their way through culture shock on a visit to Japan and commiserate with each other about their troubled marriages and life in general.Bob Harris is an over-the-hill film star relegated to making whiskey commercials in Japan, where he is on a short stint when the movie opens. He apparently loathes himself for the work he is doing. His marriage has grown stale after 25 years and there does not appear to be a remedy for the situation. The telephone interaction between Bob and his wife is cold and distant, their only mutual interest is their children. Charlotte is a recent Yale graduate who majored in philosophy. With no job prospects on the horizon and a relatively short marriage which is going downhill fast, she finds herself very alone and lost. Charlotte is lovely, remarkably bright and totally ignored by her workaholic, famous photographer husband who inhabits a world more shallow than his wife can bear. Bob and Charlotte, unable to sleep, meet late one night in the hotel bar and strike up an unusual metaphysical conversation, of sorts. The two seem to understand and empathize with each other instantly. Palpable chemistry vibrates between them. These vibes would ordinarily be difficult to achieve with such a disparity in ages. However, Director Coppola does not let her characters off easily and go the typical May-December romance route. The couple share tremendous intimacy based on feelings not sex. They interact with unusual warmth, gentleness and a tremendous sense of sadness and yearning.""Lost In Translation"" is also a comedy of cultures - our own western culture and Japan's. Culture clash and shock threaten to overwhelm Bob. The language, food, customs, pace of life alienate him more than he was before his plane landed in Tokyo. Together Bob and Charlotte find normalcy, a connection at a difficult point in time.Murray gives an absolutely fantastic performance. He is so real, so natural as Bob Harris that it seems like he never worked from a script. Ms. Johansson is just perfect with her radiant innocence and wry humor. It is sheer pleasure to watch the two hang-out together. Ms. Coppola captures Tokyo from a foreigner's perspective - as Bob and Charlotte would view and experience the city - with its bright lights, towering skyscrapers, the Eastern take on Western culture, lots of action, movement and clamor.This is a small gem of a movie that left me teary eyed, but not sentimentally so.

It is a really great movie, I never expected to enjoy this as much as I did.The hd-dvd has a few features (a 30 minute behind the scenes, which is ok), and a 10 minute interview with Bill Murray and The writer / director.

619495,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005JMJ4,Jason,"[4, 11]","I hold Bill Murray in high regards.  He's simply one of the best comedic actors of the last few generations.  His timing and mannerisms are impeccable.  Similarly, Scarlett Johansson's young career has proven that her talent precedes her, and she's not a bad actress either.  Add in the concept and chemistry between the two, and this should have been a can't-miss movie.  Should have been a movie that actually deserved the praise and recognitions it received.  Instead, it's boring.The plot is as simple as the movie is boring.  Platonic love between an aging American star (Murray) and a bored, young girlfriend (Johansson) of a Canadian photographer on assignment in Japan.  When the two link up, they test the limits of an audience's attention span while dragging around this corpse of a movie like it's a sequel to Weekend at Bernie's.Oh, look!  It's Bill bored.  Hey!  It's Scarlett bored!  They're both lonely as well.  Yaaaawn.  Someone needs to hook these two up with an internet connection and a social networking website.  Or better yet, how about a Tokyo tour-guide!?  They're each disconsolate, not to mention lacking curiosity and imagination.  After a few chance encounters at a bar, they morph into pseudo-soulmates - the connection within the movie is never really established.The plot is underdeveloped at best, and the dialogue is so bad it causes aneurisms.  I think Murray and Johansson did what they could with the script they were given (because the acting is fine), but the writing/directing from Sofia Coppola is pathetic (no way she gets even a nomination if not for her last name).  The pacing of this movie is slightly slower than a glacial drift, and it's nearly as agonizing as being water-boarded.And before anyone leaves me the comment, I get it.  It's not that complicated.  It's simply uninteresting and undeserving of all the credit.  Somehow, a movie was created which caused my disinterest in not only the classically hilarious Bill Murray, but also the voluptuous vixen Scarlett Johannsen.  Before this movie, I would have thought it as likely as seeing Keanu Reeves hold an Oscar.

It was easy to care about both characters and see why they were such good friends.  But it is the comparison between the crisis of the post-college generation who ask ""What else is there?"" and the crisis between mid-lifers who are also not sure what is left that won me overBob Harris (Bill Murray) is an aging actor whose career has come to a near stand still.  He travels to Tokyo to make his riches from appearing in commercials.  Feeling lost both from the euphoric environment of Japan and the fading long-distance relationship between his wife and children, he spends most of his leisure time either at a bar or trying to understand and enjoy Japanese television.Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a young, recent college graduate who has followed her husband, an equally young photographer.  Bored and disenchanted, Charlotte wanders through Tokyo, managing a few smiles at the sights and the people.Only after these two lonely hearts meet do their smiles grow and their lives feel less in limbo.  When they are away from one another, the two suffer from their usual insomnia and their frowns return.  But together, their smiles are almost consistent and their lives shine.The genius of the film, however, is the story.  Harris is clearly suffering from a sort of ""mid-life crisis.""  But his situation is not unlike Charlotte's, who is also suffering from a similar crisis, where she is not sure where she wants to go next.  Both fear adulthood and wonder if it is really worth the risks.I recommend this film to others who enjoy film as an art rather than as entertainment.

Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a formally popular actor who has seen his celebrity dwindle to a point where he has become a rather sadder version of ""The Simpson's"" character Troy McClure.

Unable to understand exactly what his paymasters want from him, he spends an increasing amount of time in his hotel doing very little; it is here that he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), the Ivy League educated young wife of a celebrity photographer who is staying in the same hotel.

Here, Murray plays Bob Harris, an American has-been actor in a lukewarm marriage, who is sent to Japan to star in a whiskey ad.""Lost in Translation"" depicts the collision of the American and Japanese media cultures, making Hollywood seem tame by comparison. The Japanese, we are asked to believe, love anything Hollywood, whether they recognize the star or not. Along the way, we are treated to an inside view of the Japanese media culture, which is almost repellent in its mania for bright lights, loud music and in-your-face advertising. There's plenty of opportunity for comedy, as Murrray bumps into various people who treat him less as a human being than as a commodity to pampered, partied, posed and paid. Along the way, Murray makes the acquaintance of Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansenn, the newly married wife of a wannabe director. Their loneliness and isolation gives them a chance to find friendship and perhaps more among the faceless rhythms of Japanese urban life. Their September-May relationship is touching, not altogether predictable, and throws them into new orbits, giving the audience something to ponder at the end of the film.",4,Finding Sanity in a Wacko-san world,1100822400,"11 19, 2004",2004,1342,"['Lost', 'Translation', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'kind', 'deadpan', 'expressionlessnes', 'Murray', 'serious', 'roles', 'more', 'mugging', 'acting', 'film', 'Here', 'Murray', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'American', 'has-been', 'actor', 'lukewarm', 'marriage', 'who', 'sent', 'Japan', 'star', 'whiskey', 'ad', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'collision', 'American', 'Japanese', 'media', 'cultures', 'making', 'Hollywood', 'seem', 'tame', 'comparison', 'Japanese', 'are', 'asked', 'believe', 'love', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'recognize', 'star', 'not', 'way', 'are', 'treated', 'inside', 'view', 'Japanese', 'media', 'culture', 'almost', 'repellent', 'mania', 'bright', 'lights', 'loud', 'music', 'in-your-face', 'advertising', 'plenty', 'opportunity', 'comedy', 'Murrray', 'various', 'people', 'who', 'treat', 'human', 'being', 'commodity', 'pampered', 'partied', 'posed', 'paid', 'way', 'Murray', 'acquaintance', 'Charlotte', 'played', 'Scarlett', 'Johansenn', 'newly', 'married', 'wife', 'wannabe', 'director', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'chance', 'find', 'friendship', 'perhaps', 'more', 'faceless', 'rhythms', 'Japanese', 'urban', 'life', 'September-May', 'relationship', 'touching', 'not', 'altogether', 'predictable', 'new', 'orbits', 'giving', 'audience', 'something', 'ponder', 'end', 'film']",Lost in Translation

Just be sure to watch it at a time when you can handle the deliberate speed.The acting---It's all pretty good. Bill Murray does pretty much the exact same role as he had in &quot;Rushmore,&quot; only without as much charm.The romance---This is definitely not one of the greatest love stories ever. The two main characters are both so uninteresting, their love is so inexplicable that there isn't much reason to hope they get together. Watching them fall in love with each other is sort of like viewing a nature documentary on the mating rituals of slugs. It just feels so, so wrong the entire time--there aren't any sparks or fireworks or rushes of joy in the movie. People like to say that the love story is great because it is &quot;subdued&quot; rather than forced like a typical movie. That's all well and good, but the romance in here isn't &quot;subdued&quot;--it's beaten with a tack hammer, gagged, blindfolded, and then sedated with 4000 cc's of horse tranquilizers. The ending is the only good part of their story.The script---This is the biggest problem with the movie. The script is so poorly written that I cannot fathom why it won an Oscar. The humor is about as low-quality as you can get, and often wanders into what I would call racist territory. Another customer here commented that many of the jokes hinge on the fact that the Japanese mix up l's and r's. It turns out that about three-fourths of all the &quot;jokes&quot; in the movie are just scenes where the main characters sit around and poke fun at the Japanese. It is a sad, sad movie when the most brilliant joke in the movie is, &quot;What? LIP them? Don't you mean RIP them?&quot;To be fair, however, the movie does have many beautiful shots. The direction is actually very good, no matter what the speed of the movie might be. The acting, as I said, is generally pretty good. In fact, everything in the movie that ISN'T the script is generally pretty good.

619510,A2GAK89B29KSKX,B00005JMJ4,"J. Kruppa ""JKruppa""","[6, 7]","One of the oft-stated purposes of the creative arts, beyond that of simple entertainment, is to enlighten the spectator by inspiring reflection on his or her own condition.  Works of creative expression can thus involve us in a kind of dialogue with the work that illuminates aspects of our lives in ways we might not have considered otherwise.  Such works don&#65533;t need to be perfect masterpieces, or even necessarily &#65533;good&#65533; as defined along any number of narrow guidelines.  They only need to touch a chord, evoke an emotional reaction and give us pause.Lost In Translation engages us in that dialogue through an unconventional love story told without the melodrama typical of most films of this stripe.  The premise is straightforward: Bob Harris (Bill Murray, in one of his best roles), a fading Hollywood star visiting Tokyo to shoot a commercial because he needs the money, meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who is visiting Tokyo with her self-absorbed celebrity photographer husband.  The spiritual dislocation both Bob and Charlotte have probably been carrying around for some time comes into bold relief due to a mixture of loneliness, cultural isolation and insomnia, and as they run into each other more often in the bar of the hotel where they are both staying, they spark with the sense of kindred recognition.There is a revealing moment in Lost In Translation where Bob and Charlotte are lying in bed together talking (it bears mentioning that they are both fully clothed and haven&#65533;t had sex, nor do they ever within the narrative span of the film).  The conversation begins lightly in tone, then gravitates toward the Big Issues we all face --  marriage, children, knowing oneself, growing old -- and winds down with Charlotte lying half-curled on her side facing Bob lying on his back, their rapport and mutual affection having built to this point into something comfortable and relaxed, yet without any physical contact.  Then, just before the scene fades out, Bob reaches out a few inches and very matter-of-factly puts his hand on Charlotte&#65533;s foot, a simple, tender gesture that lays open what this film is all about.There are a number of moments like this -- the last scene of the movie is particularly touching because of the way director Sofia Coppola stages it -- which are ripe with the knowledge that romance and affection need not lead inexorably to sex, and can offer far greater rewards.  Considered in tandem with Coppola&#65533;s previous film, The Virgin Suicides, we might in fact be seeing the emergence of a theme in her work concerning chaste relationships between members of the opposite sex who convey a profound sense of intimacy through small gestures.  (For contrast, the aftermath of sexual union in both films is either an embarassment or a severe disappointment.)Lost In Translation admittedly has its flaws.  Some scenes go on too long, some are unnecessary, and various lines of dialogue should have been rewritten to excavate the truth from inside the cliche.  The poetic style -- unhurried, suggestive, often wordless -- is more common in European films and will be most effective for those who appreciate storytelling that prefers subtle movement over clumsy exposition.

Lund ""jazzbrat""","[3, 3]","After reading a selection of prior reviews here at amazon, it's obvious that LOST IN TRANSLATION isn't for everybody...Who might it be for?  For one, someone who is more into character close-ups than plot twists.  The whole movie is about getting under the surface of Bob and Charlotte (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson) at a brief, intersecting point in their lives, two Americans half a world away in Tokyo.  Timewise, the movie covers roughly 3-4 days ... which doesn't allow for much in the way of plot surprises.  The movie is effective in stepping the viewer into their shoes: it INTENDS to reflect a sense of intermittent boredom.  In my opinion without actually being a boring movie, but that I would say is where reviewers take sides.  Frankly, I can see why some think this movie is a chore to sit through.  On the other hand, I can hardly wait to see it again.Also, what does one expect from a Bill Murray movie?  Here the spry wit that has saved many otherwise forgettable movies is mostly subdued, as befits a middle-aged has-been actor (not Murray himself, of course I mean the role he's playing here).  If you can block out memories of the often-hilarious energy Murray brought to previous roles, then I believe his efforts in L.I.T. can be better appreciated by those who don't already see &quot;best actor award&quot; in his performance.  L.I.T. seems more a &quot;dramedy,&quot; and I think some of the movie trailers create expectations more in line with Murray's past films than the one it is attempting to sell.  This movie is imo on the &quot;other side&quot; of GROUNDHOG DAY from the starting point of such B.M. feel-good vehicles as STRIPES or GHOSTBUSTERS.As far as how Japan is portrayed, I'd say L.I.T. does present a wide cross-section of Japanese people, from business professionals to bizarre television hosts.  To the extent that particular scenes do focus on some of the wackier aspects of Japanese pop culture, I'd say that this is another example of director Coppola attempting to look at Tokyo through the eyes of the lead characters, both of whom are experiencing culture shock (not to mention jet-lag) and thus more likely to see their surroundings in a skewed manner (and being that this is a movie, if the director opts to represent that bias he/she has to visualize it, which is likely to involve a bit of stereotyping).  Overall, L.I.T. gets my two thumbs up, but I would say to any potential buyers who aren't familiar with the film to check out other reviews -- those who love it AND those who pan it.  Because TRANSLATION is the type of off-center movie that will polarize audiences.  As such I rated it four stars, although for me it's a five star film.",4,Lost or Found?

My friends further whet my appetite by touting it's good qualities, and telling me what a wonderful movie it was. Perhaps I had built my expectations to dizzying heights, perhaps it was the influence of others that placed this movie head and shoulders above anything I'd see. In my mind, it was Citizen Kane, the pinnacle of indi-film. A life changing experience.Needless to say, I was disappointed. Incredibly so.This is not a bad movie, but its not a particularly good movie either. Sophia Coppola's debut is littered with montages that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, except to make this movie drag. Bill Murray is charming, as always, but something misses the mark. Perhaps its the fact the female lead (Scarlett Johansson) seems to have take acting lessons from Natalie Portman. By that, I mean all lines are delivered in a monotone, even when she's angered. The plot is almost non-existent, and there is very little in the way of astonishing sound or cinematography to salvage this one.It does have its good points. There are some humorous interactions between Bill Murray and basically everyone. The problem is that these interactions are few and far between. Perhaps I've become entirely too jaded to buy into the melancholy of this movie, but I just found it lacking in anything resembling a human emotion.I read somewhere that this compares to 'Harold and Maude.' I'd really suggest that you dig that one up at some point if you're considering checking 'Lost in Translation' out. It's a far superior film, without the hackneyed directing this one has.Again, my expectations were built to dizzying heights, and I was severely let down by this movie. I don't think I'll give it a second chance though, simply because it took too long to develop.

My favorite is ""Ground Hog Day.""I was interested in seeing this movie because of the things that I heard about Murray and this role.  I heard that he portrayed a character who was deep and that the movie was meaningful.  I was prepared for a bit of ""artsiness,"" and I was prepared to like Bill Murray if not the entire film.  I figured - with the Academy Award nomination and all - he must have broken new ground and stretched his acting range.Well, I failed to enjoy the movie and found Bill Murray almost unrecognizable as a human being.  Perhaps the movie was about how shallow many people are.  Perhaps it was about how difficult it is to maintain a marriage, to get older, to be deeply bored, to have a mediocre career, to think you made a big mistake, to experience selfless love.  Maybe it is about how an unlikely, inconsequential meeting of two people can almost ruin two families.Any of these seem like plausible themes.  However, there was almost no character development and almost no plot.  My guess is that the director had too little maturity and life experience to make a credible point through these characters in this situation.

In my case, I didn't think I'd like the film until I caught it on cable by chance one night and got hooked into a beautiful film that has become one of my favorites. That said, I have issues with the DVD. First of all, there are 5 minutes of forced advertisements at the beginning. They are not the type that you can skip by hitting the menu button; you've got to fast forward through them for a minute or two. The opening screen even instructs you to use the fast forward button if you don't want to see the trailers. What is this, VHS? Horrible. On top of that, there is no commentary track. If you're one of those people that really liked the film, naturally you'd like to know more with comments from at least the director and maybe the stars. This type of film almost warrants it (especially when you think of some of the scenes, like the whisper). I expected to hear Sofia giving us the inner workings/thoughts/fun facts about the film with a commentary track, and was disappointed when there wasn't one. There is a half-hour piece shot with a home video camera of Sofia and the crew running around Tokyo, along with a Rome 2003 interview with her and Bill Murray. There are deleted scenes which are pretty good, but that's about it.In my opinion, this DVD would fall into the ""acceptable"" category if it were not for the horrible forced trailers. Once again, these forced ads are really horrible. If you've got a DVD player that can fast forward up to 48x and can get through them quick, it might not be too bad. If you've got an older model that can only fast forward 2x or 4x, you'll be sitting there for a couple minutes going through trailers before you get to the menu to play the film.... every time you want to watch it. If you turn off the movie to finish it later and your player does not remember the location of the disc where you left off, you'll have to fast forward through the ads again to finish the viewing. It would not surprise me if some type of ""Collectors Edition"" DVD is released in the next year or two, without the ads, a director commentary track, and a lot more extras that this type of film deserves. With the double dipping that studios do these days (releasing a quick stripped down or acceptable disc, and then putting out a much better one later), it's almost a guarantee and I'll be first in line to grab it. Until then, I'd recommend this disc be rented at least once before making the choice to buy it or not.",3,Great film.

The setting is cool because I am pretty sure most people haven't been to Japan, or if they have haven't probably experienced in quite the jet set way the characters experienced it in the movie. Bill Murray gives his most likeable performance since Rushmore. Scarlett Johansson was hot. The sound track was pretty good. It has that whole ""outside of hollywood"" appeal going on, and depending on who you are that is a big selling point (probably the biggest selling point.)I guess the big problem is that it all seemed so luke warm. Scarlett Johansson's character could have used some more development, all we know about her is that she was a philosophy major and apparently her husband thinks she is sort of snotty. Bill Murray's character was wonderful in contrast, you can see how he could enjoyAlso on top of all that Scarlett Johansson didn't seem to fit her role well at all. I suspect the only reason she got her part in the movie was because she co-starred in ""Ghost World"" and that fact adds to the ""outside hollywood"" (aka indie/arthouse) flavor this movie was going out of it's way to achieve.Maybe that is another problem in of itself, the fact the movies seems to be patronizing the arthouse crowd with those long winded shots of Scarlett Johansson observing Japanese culture in a conundrum.Definitely an interesting film.

619519,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JMJ4,Joe Sherry,"[1, 6]","A film by Sophia CoppolaThis is a tough movie to describe because there isn't a whole lot of plot (as we would normally understand plot).  There are details that build up the two main characters and illuminate the experiences of Americans temporarily living in Tokyo.  On one hand, this was a fairly interesting movie with a great performance by Bill Murray.  On the other hand, there wasn't a whole lot going on with this movie.Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an American actor working on commercials in Japan for a while.  He is somewhat estranged from his wife and has not seen his children in a while.  While in Tokyo, he meets a much young woman who is staying in the same hotel: Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson).  Charlotte's husband works as a photographer and he is gone most of the time.  Both Bob and Charlotte are very lonely and feel isolated.  They meet, briefly talk and subsequently they keep running into each other.  Eventually they begin a friendship and they spend time together both in the hotel as well as out on the town in Tokyo.The movie deals with the friendship of Bob and Charlotte and touches upon the loneliness they feel (as well as the insomnia they share), and through this friendship we are shown what it is like for an American (who barely speaks the language) to live in Tokyo.  We see some of the cultural differences.  Some people have said that this film is racist towards the Japanese in its portrayal of the people and the country, but it felt authentic.  We know that we aren't seeing the everyday life of the Japanese people but rather how two random Americans may encounter some of the Japanese in clubs and hotels.  Of course that isn't authentic Japan, but it is an authentic experience.  Sophia Coppola wrote the screenplay and she is very gentle with the Japanese people, so I guess that I don't quite understand the accusations of racism and cultural prejudice.This is Coppola's second film and while I feel that this is a much stronger film than The Virgin Suicides, I wasn't as impressed as I felt I should be.  The critical reviews were nearly unfailing positive and glowing, but I felt like something was lacking.  Lost in Translation (the title alludes to how with a cultural and language difference, some things get lost in translation) was a good movie, but because the lack of focus in the plot/story, I found it difficult to really get into it.  I was impressed with the work of both Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson, and I appreciate the film a bit more the more I think about it, but I just can't manage to get excited about this movie....and that knocks it down a star.",4,"good characters, no plot.",1066867200,"10 23, 2003",2003,2623,"['film', 'Sophia', 'CoppolaThis', 'tough', 'movie', 'describe', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'plot', 'would', 'normally', 'understand', 'plot', 'are', 'details', 'build', 'up', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'illuminate', 'experiences', 'Americans', 'temporarily', 'living', 'Tokyo', 'one', 'hand', 'was', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'great', 'performance', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'other', 'hand', 'was', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'going', 'movie.Bob', 'Harris', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'American', 'actor', 'working', 'commercials', 'Japan', 'while', 'somewhat', 'estranged', 'wife', 'not', 'seen', 'children', 'while', 'Tokyo', 'much', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'staying', 'same', 'hotel', 'Charlotte', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'Charlotte', 'husband', 'photographer', 'gone', 'most', 'time', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'very', 'lonely', 'feel', 'isolated', 'meet', 'briefly', 'talk', 'subsequently', 'keep', 'running', 'other', 'Eventually', 'begin', 'friendship', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'hotel', 'as', 'well', 'out', 'town', 'Tokyo.The', 'movie', 'deals', 'friendship', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'touches', 'loneliness', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'insomnia', 'share', 'friendship', 'are', 'shown', 'what', 'American', 'who', 'barely', 'language', 'live', 'Tokyo', 'see', 'cultural', 'differences', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'racist', 'Japanese', 'portrayal', 'people', 'country', 'felt', 'authentic', 'know', 'are', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'everyday', 'life', 'Japanese', 'people', 'rather', 'how', 'two', 'random', 'Americans', 'may', 'encounter', 'Japanese', 'clubs', 'hotels', 'course', ""n't"", 'authentic', 'Japan', 'authentic', 'experience', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'very', 'gentle', 'Japanese', 'people', 'guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'accusations', 'racism', 'cultural', 'prejudice.This', 'Coppola', 'second', 'film', 'feel', 'much', 'stronger', 'film', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'impressed', 'felt', 'should', 'be', 'critical', 'reviews', 'were', 'nearly', 'unfailing', 'positive', 'glowing', 'felt', 'something', 'was', 'lacking', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'title', 'how', 'cultural', 'language', 'difference', 'things', 'get', 'lost', 'translation', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'lack', 'focus', 'plot/story', 'found', 'difficult', 'really', 'get', 'was', 'impressed', 'work', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'appreciate', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'more', 'think', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'manage', 'get', 'excited', 'movie', '.and', 'down', 'star']",Lost in Translation
619520,AD89XR3O6MKW9,B00005JMJ4,john27,"[6, 8]","My review will be similar to others who have also written.  This movie is powerful and yet represents elegance in simplicity.  We have the lonely ""has-been"" actor, stuck in Tokyo doing a whisky commercial.  We have the ""twentysomething"" who is still searching for her identity and meaning in this world.Two people were placed here by external forces (Murray's employers and Johansson's husband.)  As we see Murray in the bar and Johansson staring out the window, the message is glaring-""I do not fit.""  We become excited when Murray and Johansson find each other.  Together, Johansson and Murray make themselves fit in this complex world they do not understand and ultimately make their own world.  Murray becomes young again as he sings karoke and tours the town with Johansson-only to find the disturbing reality that across the oceans, his wife is concerned with office carpet samples.  Johansson learns about life, that everyone eventually finds their place in it-only to go back to her husband who is concerned with surface-level issues pertaining to his job.The beauty of this movie is there is no romance between the two.  It is an experience of two people who find each other and form a friendship.  The final scene is one we do not want to see, where they say goodbye.  This movie leaves you satiated and reaffirms the goodness of humanity.

I did not know what I was doing when I wrote the one star review of Gangs Of New York, butlet me tell you I really and ever since I saw the film I gave itfive stars. I also really really love the decade I am living inright now which is my all time favorite decade the 21st century.Let me explain, I only wrote the false bad review of Gangs OfNew York to show my friends the dangers of what could happen Ifwe insult films of past decades, which is somebody could insultour favorite things. They were insulting great films from thepast like Raging Bull and French Connection and I got mad forI did not want them insulting classic oscar type films frompast decades. Make no mistake, I truly agree with them that the1980's was a truly truly horrible, pointless, and stupid decadefilled with nothing but cheap clothes, cheesy music, and worstof all mean spirited people. The 1980's were only good for onething that was movies. However, every decade has great movies, it is always a great time for movies. However everything elseof the 1980's was worthless and forgettable. However I realizedthat just teaching my friends a lesson of not insulting classicoscar type films from the past films only hurt myself. For Iaccidentally insulted my all time favorite decade which was thetruly truly beautiful and wonderful 21st century. I love I meanI truly love the 21st century and even when I wrote the one starreview of Gangs Of New York and accidentally insulted my all time favorite decade the 21st century, I did not know what Iwas doing. All this stuff that I just said is implied in myfive star March 28th 2004 review of Gangs Of New York, that review features me saying the same stuff I said in my five starMarch 28th 2004 review of Gangs Of New York. In the March 28th2004 five star review of Gangs Of New York, I also implied thatHollywood is still strong and it is still strong from this dayon. I also learned on July 11th 2003 that Hollywood was alwaysstrong, you see I did not know at the beginning of every year,Hollywood would release all the stuff nobody is interested inseeing first, and than by mid February they start to release theexciting stuff. After that, I felt so bad that I wanted to erasethat one star review of Gangs Of New York, but it would not letme erase the review and I tried to work out the problem for hours but nothing happened. I forgot about it for months, but atthe time I was feeling sad for a few days that I insulted adecade I truly I mean truly loved which is the wonderful andbeautiful 21st century. However during July 2003, I could notremember If I wrote an apology review for it still did not warnmy friends of the dangers, but I was feeling better for I waswatching my favorite films, music, and HBO TV from my all timefavorite decade the 21st century. From than on I felt great,Than on March 28th 2004, I decides to write what I truly trulythought of Gangs Of New York and my all time favorite decade the21st century. I wrote down with enthusiasm and honesty that Inot only truly truly love Gangs Of New York, but that I alsotruly truly loved my all time favorite decade the 21st century.Make no mistake I have always loved my all time favorite decadethe 21st century, from the start to present day. I also loveliving in my all time favorite decade the 21st century, wherepeople are nice, and their is truly truly awesome technologylike the internet, DVD players, and Playstation 2. The 1980'swas a horrible, pointless, and stupid decade for it also hasnone of the stuff the awesome 21st century had. My all timefavorite decade is the 21st century which is also the one I amgrowing up in. I love the 21st century for people are nice, wehave the internet, DVD players, and Playstation 2. I love myall time favorite decade which is the 21st century, in face Iown the great movies from the 21st century. I own all the DVD'sof the great movies from the 21st century. That is everythingfrom Erin Brockovich to Lord Of The Rings Return Of The King.I am telling you the honest honest truth. I love the 21st century, it is my all time favorite decade. I am proud to livein the 21st century, we get the internet, DVD players, andPlaystation 2. Plus HBO TV is great my favorite ones are TheSopranos, Oz, Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and of course Deadwood. I also love the HBO miniseries Band Of Brothersand Angels In America. Plus people are really nice in my all time favorite decade the 21st century. I am truly being honestwith everything I just said in my review, which is the same thing I did with my March 28th 2004 review of Gangs Of New York.I am also being honest I mean truly honest I love I mean reallyreally love the beautiful and wonderful 21st century, which ismy all time favorite decade of all time.

I imagine that the movie company deserves some blame as they did sell this movie as a comedy.  I think it is an absolutely brilliant movie.  I have found that my friends who have travelled to the Far East and have encountered the culture shock displayed in the movie all like this movie.  I think it's easier to relate to the jetlag, culture shocked world in which the characters find themselves.  I certainly can understand how being dropped into an alien world would cause one to assess all their assumptions and find themselves lost as the characters do.I think the ennui and the unresolved nature of the movie disturbs a lot of people.  Most movie goers seem to like a neat little story in which the protagonist changes and becomes a better person or the bad guy gets what's coming to them.  This movie is realistic to me because a) the old man DOESN'T sleep with the young girl. b) there is no SOLUTION for their problems (they are just able to console each other) c) their relationship is realistic because in their own society they would have nothing in common but here in Japan they are kindred souls.

619530,A34JOJV93F2RHX,B00005JMJ4,"Jonathan B Whitcomb ""Emery's Misery""","[4, 7]","I watched this movie once, several months ago. I'm writing this review more about the impact the film left on me over time, rather than an immediate impression.Several reviewers call this a racist movie that belittles Japanese. I disagree. This movie isn't about Japan or about the Japanese people. It is about two Americans who are lost in a place where nothing is familiar so they are forced to confront their own problems and loneliness because there is nothing else for them to do. This story had to be made in a foreign place, and it could have been Tokyo, or it could have been Bombay, Bangkok or Madrid. But I understand the choice of Japan. The location needed to be where few speak English and where the culture is unfamiliar to the characters and most of the audience. If you put these two characters in a hotel in New York or Chicago they wouldn't have come together. They are so unalike that they had to be in a place where merely being American and lonely was enough to bring them together.This is a story about two people in a foreign place who are in no position to cope with their unfamiliar environs. That has less to do with who or where they are than the stages of life they are in. Bob is entering a classic mid-life crisis where his career is declining and he's losing touch with his family. Charlotte is young and newly married and is coming to grips with her new identity as the wife of a photographer who has little time or attention to give her and seems to have lost interest in her. They are struggling to find their own identities in times of transition. That's hard enough to do in comfortable, familiar surroundings, but transporting them to this crowded city of strange voices, smells, sounds and bright lights just amplifies their loneliness.Put these two characters in a US city and they'll find refuge in a bar, a movie theater,a book store, a museum, a ballgame or whatever. But put them in Tokyo and they are lost. They are not in a position to learn or appreciate the new and rich culture that surrounds them. They are looking for distraction and comfort but instead they find themselves feeling lost and out of place.So Coppola's treatment of Japanese characters isn't racist or demeaning. It is just a plot device used to emphasise how Charlotte and Bob are feeling.I found the story and characters very moving. It is deliberately paced slowly and is shot and scored to give it a dreamlike quality. It is a story of an unlikely friendship in an unfamiliar place, yet the story is so direct and human that it feels familiar.This movie isn't everyone's cup of tea. Action film fans should look elsewhere, as should fans of slapstick comedy. This subtle film needs to be given space to seep into your pores and transport you.

619532,AU3GYRAKBUAEU,B00005JMJ4,Jon Norris,"[7, 11]","I was disappointed in my first viewing of this film. I watched it on the same day as Whale Rider and Secondhand Lions, and frankly both are much better films.However, after reading some of the wildly raving reviews, I went back and watched it again to see if I had somehow missed something. It did improve on the second viewing. I think I was put off by the pacing and general tone of the film on first viewing. I caught more of the subtle points the second time around, but still found that many important things passed too quickly (text of faxes, for example), while other things, such as the endless boredom scenes of Charlotte in her hotel room, went on way longer than needed to make the point.I have to wonder if the film wasn't specifically designed to be vague in order to be some kind of Rorschach test for the person viewing it. It seems to me that we are actually told and shown very little about the two characters, and I think people are projecting a great deal when I read the reviews. For example, I didn't find the elevator scene where he was so much taller than everyone else to be racist so much as pointing out how he stood out as very different from everyone around him. It seemed to me to be about his isolation, not racism. (Maybe I'm projecting.........)We know that the young woman, Charlotte, is in a marriage that no longer excites her. She hasn't ""found herself"" yet in life, and has reached a point of angst mixed with ennui that is not uncommon for someone her age as the hype fades and the bubble bursts. She is numb, bored, and in her own words, ""stuck."" Life isn't fun or easy any more.The aging actor, Bob, is portrayed as probably having a drinking problem, although that isn't completely clear. We do know that he is feeling burned out, his marriage is no longer supportive or comfortable, and that he is no longer getting the film roles that made him popular. It is strongly hinted that he is past his prime and on the way down, but still big enough to get 2 million dollars for an ad campaign. He also is numb and withdrawn from life.The thing I realized on the second viewing is that these are not extraordinary people. They are not witty Neil Simon intellectuals gamely facing the trials and tribulations of life in an endlessly entertaining manner. They are painfully ordinary and caught in the doldrums of life. She turns to him for wisdom about her situation, but only gets things like, ""I'm not worried about you,"" or ""You'll figure it out."" He has no wise words to make her life all better again.He turns to her for some touch of youth and energy, and that doesn't work either. Both these people are stuck behind barriers of pain and boredom, and are neither secure nor open to honest emotional exchange. Their meetings are frequently awkward, and their conversations are usually halting and shallow. They do manage to grow because of each other, and that is good.This movie isn't ""Harold and Maude,"" ""Same Time Next Year,"" or ""Razor's Edge,"" nor does it try to be. All the discussion about politics and Hollywood is neither here nor there. Did it deserve an Oscar? I don't honestly know. Oscars aren't exactly objective awards, and Sofia does have a famous Hollywood name. On the other hand, for a first movie, I don't think it is all that bad. It is different, gets its point across, and does tell a story, whether it is a story you want to hear or not. Making a movie is not at all easy, and I say Sofia did okay.As far as the acting goes, it is easy to attack Johansson because her character is so ordinary, but have you considered how difficult it is to play ""ordinary?"" The actress who played the Hollywood starlet had a much easier job because her character was such a caricature. I think they all did okay. It was worth spending the time to see it twice and pick up what I missed. I doubt I would watch it a third time, though. I think all the hype did it more harm than good.The thing that impressed me most was how well the film did at making me feel like an outsider in Japanese culture. I really got a sense of isolation and confusion with all the Japanese signs and no English words for reference, and the constant barrage of rapidly spoken Japanese. The film did a great job there. Watch it for that at least.UPDATE: May 2011After speaking with a younger colleague who absolutely loves this film, I have decided that there is probably a generational thing going on.

The movie failed to entertain me for almost the entire time that I sat through it. It never got my excited where I wanted to see what was going to happen next.Yes the scenery is amazing and it makes you want to go visit downtown Tokyo straight away, and of course Bill Murray delivers one of the best performances of his life-time and when you are talking about an actor like Bill Murray that is saying something, he is truly phenomenal in this role but even he cannot force me to watch this movie again. Even though I believe that his acting was great I do believe that the Academy made the right decision in passing him over and giving the Oscar to Sean Penn just because Mystic River was a much better movie.(...) believe everyone got caught up in the hype with this movie, does it look great at times. Yes it does. Does Bill Murray deliver one of the best performances of his career and does he literally drag the movie around on its back to make it even barely watchable...yes he does...is this Sophia Coppola's best movie? Not even close, if you want to see what I consider to be her finest work then be sure to check out the Virgin Suicides, which although isn't a feel-good movie is a very powerful work of art.

Of course, I was never, as LOST IN TRANSLATION has it, beached in so culturally unfamiliar a place as Tokyo. Does Cleveland count?Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, an American movie star just arrived in Japan's capital to do promos for Suntory whiskey. His lack of enthusiasm for the gig is obvious and, worse, he's disoriented by the difference in language, customs and working conditions. So, he spends his free time either in the hotel bar, or battling insomnia on his hotel bed while brooding on his marriage doldrums. The extent of his wife's need for his presence back home is indicated only by the carpet samples she fedexes for him to choose from. At one point in a call to the States, Bob wishes that they eat Japanese food more often, and his wife matter-of-factly suggests that he just stay there and have it every day.Down the hall is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a young wife accompanying her pro photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), on a business trip. Hubby is so involved with the job that his wife feels like excess baggage. Charlotte wanders the city unmoved by the experience of discovery, and spends sleepless nights staring out the window at Tokyo's glitter.Though Bob and Charlotte could pass on the sidewalk in any American city and not even notice, in this vacuum created by loneliness and the Hollywood scriptwriters, the two discover each other despite a 30-year difference in age.Murray's understated performance is a gem, and may garner him an Oscar nomination. Bob's potentially a funny guy, but his innate sense of humor is being suffocated by boredom, weariness, and the irritation of being in some incomprehensible place where he'd rather not be. For her part, Charlotte drifts along like a zombie. It's only in the company of each other that the two come out of their respective funks.As much as I applaud Murray's performance, perhaps the best of his career, and admire LOST IN TRANSLATION as an intelligent and perceptive production, I found it less successful as an entertainment vehicle. (After all, that's why I spend money to go to the moving picture show.) While I did occasionally cackle appreciatively, most strongly during the sequence when Bob is beset by a misguided hooker, the film was so glacially paced that it got me fidgeting. I kept waiting for something - anything - to happen. Not an FX-laden kung fu or car chase action sequence, of course, but perhaps some outburst of passion or raw emotion. The plot contained no conflict. It was like watching the poor devils in a slow post office queue strike up polite conversations with fellow sufferers fore and aft to alleviate the tedium. Perhaps it's just because I didn't sympathize with Bob's predicament. His seemed like a lost opportunity to catch up on his reading.

Bob Harris who is a actor that has been going abit downhill lately, both his movie career that used to be better, hence that's why he's making commercials in Japan and not acting full stop anymore, but even his private life is rather boring. With a wife that seems very busy with their children and a love that is almost long gone. The second person is Charlotte (Scralett Johansson) a young girl that has just married to John (Giovanni Ribisi) but doesn't seem too happy by that. He's a photographer and very busy, he rather not have her with him while he works and she's stuck in the hotel room most of the time, doing nothing. Just like Bob, who's there alone and doesn't know anyone in Tokyo.Eventually they meet up and slowly get to know each other, despite him being a man in his 50's and she a young girl in her early 20's they become soul mates and spend alot of time together, discussing, drinking, going out, having fun. They really undestand each other, like no one else in the world possibly could have done.This movie is also about life in Tokyo, and Japanese in general. You get to see alot of their culture and the big city life in Tokyo, Perhaps not the always the nicest things but it does give a good picture of the life there.Sofia Coppola both wrote and directed the movie and it was surely better then the depressing ""Virgin Suicides"" even if this also was a emotional movie with alot of feelings involved.

619541,A189COFU9UUX2L,B00005JMJ4,Joseph M. Patane,"[4, 6]","I read a few of the reviews already given for this movie. Those who are young, who have a lot of life yet to experienc will not identify with the main character of this movie. The movie will seem to flow slowly with no real interest other than the sort of fast life protrayed in the city of Tokyo.In actual fact, if one is about the age of Bill Murray, one can identify with his character and find a lot more meaning in this movie. The movie then flows, it is interesting, it has more meaning.I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wanted more from the movie. Murray very well protrayed his frustration, his lonliness in life with his eyes, his expressions, his demeanor. I felt that if he had talked with Charlotte more, talked about his life vs hers - why did he feel ennui, feel lonely, out of touch even in a crowed room. This greater interplay might have made this movie more intesting to people of all ages.There were many touching moments in this movie. When Murray carried Charlotte to bed after their first foray into Tokyo, you could tell she felt ""safe"" in his arms, as if she was in her father's arms. It was a very touching scene to me. Murray was caught between his role as a father and his growing love for her. He opted for the role as father, which said a lot for his character. There were two types of love there for all to see - a father's love for a daughter, and a man's love for a woman. Both were there at the same time.Later they were in bed together discussing a lot of issues. He tried to help her see life in a positive way and he helped her. Now at this point it would have been appropriate for him to be more open with her to discuss his life, it would have been a more powerful moment. I believe just a few minutes of dialogue would have sufficed at this point to create a greater frission that was already developed between these two lost people. At this end of this scene the audience is given a view of her lying next to him, her feet pressed against his leg. His right hand moves from beside him to touch her feet. It was a touching moment. Here again the father/daughter/potential lovers dual relationship is even more evident. Once more his role as father wins over the supposedly normal ""male takes what is offered"" role. He knows who he is, and this knowledge is what creates his lonliness.The scene in which he has taken the red-headed singer to bed, after they met the previous night in the bar, and then Charlotte knocks on his door the following morning, encountering the fact that he has had company for the night, detracts somewhat from the love that was growing between these disparate people. Yet this defines that the weakness was always there, the need to exorcise lonliness, but it was not done with Charlotte. This too is telling of his character.The final moment, the tender goodbye was the best moment. He finally kisses her, and he kisses her on the lips, then on the cheek. You can almost feel the younger man inside him has come out and replaced the older face, the older arms and hands, the older body for just a moment. He was there, this younger person. Then he said goodbye, for unlike what the younger male might have and could have done, the older mind in the young male kept his place, kept things as they could only have turned out.Hearts can reach out from another place and give love. This happens every day when we go to work after we say goodbye in the morning to the wife and kids. They are with us all day. Then too, I believe that hearts can reach out from another time and give love. It is a sadder love, but love nonetheless.Joe",4,Lost in Translation - a man grappling with aging in a fast world,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,3615,"['read', 'few', 'reviews', 'already', 'given', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'young', 'who', 'have', 'lot', 'life', 'yet', 'experienc', 'will', 'not', 'identify', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'movie', 'will', 'seem', 'flow', 'slowly', 'real', 'interest', 'other', 'sort', 'fast', 'life', 'protrayed', 'city', 'Tokyo.In', 'actual', 'fact', 'one', 'age', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'one', 'can', 'identify', 'character', 'find', 'lot', 'more', 'meaning', 'movie', 'movie', 'then', 'interesting', 'more', 'meaning.I', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'only', 'wanted', 'more', 'movie', 'Murray', 'very', 'well', 'protrayed', 'frustration', 'lonliness', 'life', 'eyes', 'expressions', 'demeanor', 'felt', 'had', 'talked', 'Charlotte', 'more', 'talked', 'life', 'vs', 'hers', 'why', 'did', 'feel', 'ennui', 'feel', 'lonely', 'touch', 'even', 'crowed', 'room', 'greater', 'interplay', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'intesting', 'people', 'were', 'many', 'touching', 'moments', 'movie', 'When', 'Murray', 'carried', 'Charlotte', 'bed', 'first', 'foray', 'Tokyo', 'could', 'tell', 'felt', 'safe', 'arms', 'was', 'father', 'arms', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'scene', 'Murray', 'was', 'caught', 'role', 'father', 'growing', 'love', 'opted', 'role', 'father', 'said', 'lot', 'character', 'were', 'two', 'types', 'love', 'see', 'father', 'love', 'daughter', 'man', 'love', 'woman', 'were', 'same', 'time.Later', 'were', 'bed', 'together', 'discussing', 'lot', 'issues', 'tried', 'help', 'see', 'life', 'positive', 'way', 'helped', 'Now', 'point', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appropriate', 'be', 'more', 'open', 'discuss', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'moment', 'believe', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'dialogue', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'point', 'create', 'greater', 'frission', 'was', 'already', 'developed', 'two', 'lost', 'people', 'end', 'scene', 'audience', 'given', 'view', 'lying', 'next', 'feet', 'pressed', 'leg', 'right', 'hand', 'moves', 'touch', 'feet', 'was', 'touching', 'moment', 'Here', 'again', 'father/daughter/potential', 'lovers', 'dual', 'relationship', 'even', 'more', 'evident', 'Once', 'more', 'role', 'father', 'supposedly', 'normal', 'male', 'what', 'offered', 'role', 'who', 'knowledge', 'what', 'lonliness.The', 'scene', 'taken', 'red-headed', 'singer', 'bed', 'met', 'previous', 'night', 'bar', 'then', 'Charlotte', 'knocks', 'door', 'following', 'morning', 'encountering', 'fact', 'had', 'company', 'night', 'somewhat', 'love', 'was', 'growing', 'disparate', 'people', 'weakness', 'was', 'always', 'there', 'need', 'exorcise', 'lonliness', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'Charlotte', 'too', 'telling', 'character.The', 'final', 'moment', 'tender', 'goodbye', 'was', 'best', 'moment', 'finally', 'lips', 'then', 'cheek', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'younger', 'man', 'come', 'out', 'replaced', 'older', 'face', 'older', 'arms', 'hands', 'older', 'body', 'just', 'moment', 'was', 'there', 'younger', 'person', 'Then', 'said', 'goodbye', 'what', 'younger', 'male', 'might', 'have', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'older', 'mind', 'young', 'male', 'kept', 'place', 'kept', 'things', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'turned', 'out.Hearts', 'can', 'reach', 'out', 'place', 'give', 'love', 'day', 'when', 'go', 'work', 'say', 'goodbye', 'morning', 'wife', 'kids', 'are', 'day', 'Then', 'too', 'believe', 'hearts', 'can', 'reach', 'out', 'time', 'give', 'love', 'sadder', 'love', 'love', 'nonetheless.Joe']",Lost in Translation

619543,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00005JMJ4,Josh Hitchens,"[12, 18]","Writer-director Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" is an exquisite gem of a movie. It is her love letter to the city of Tokyo, which the breathtaking cinematography captures in all of its garish glory. ""Lost in Translation"" more than fulfills the promise made by Coppola's first directorial effort, ""The Virgin Suicides,"" and shows that she is a major new filmmaker with a voice all of her own.Bill Murray has given many memorable performances in his career, but he may never top is work here. Murray was deservedly Oscar nominated for his performance as Bob Harris, a lonely washed-up movie star in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial. Bob's career and his marriage have gone sour; on the phone calls home his wife and children are barely interested in him. Murray's best moments come when he seems to be unaware that he's acting, when the camera turns to his face and it is filled with such profound sadness it breaks your heart. ""Lost in Translation"" is filled with many tiny moments like this, moments that make up real life but are seldom captured so effectively on film.Suffering from insomnia in the lonely Tokyo hotel, Bob meets the twentysomething Charlotte, played with beautiful subtlety and grace by Scarlett Johansson. Charlotte has been married for two years to a video director who hardly acknowledges her presence. Charlotte is alone and drifting, and in the night she and Bob strike up a friendship. Those expecting a May-December love story are watching the wrong film. Bob and Charlotte have many late night conversations about what life means to them, and they relate to one another in a very precious way.Murray and Johansson play this unique relationship perfectly, making you see the humanity of Bob and Charlotte, how in their loneliness they reach out and touch one another's lives. It is a bond that probably could not exist in the world outside of their hotel, and they know it. So Bob and Charlotte spend all of the time they can with each other, but eventually it must end. The ending to ""Lost in Translation"" is oner of the best I have ever seen in film. It is perfect. As Bob is leaving to return to his family, he leans in and whispers something into Charlotte's ear. We are not allowed to hear what he says, and it's better that way.Bob and Charlotte part company knowing that they have shared something very special that has changed their lives. In the darkness of midnight Tokyo, two lost people found one another, and it is wondrous to watch. This is a very moody, quiet, beautiful film. You may get antsy because of the slow pace, but stick with it. You will be rewarded with the miracle of Bill Murray's performance and Sofia Coppola's Oscar-winning achievement.",5,Murray and Coppola Work Miracles,1092009600,"08 9, 2004",2004,2703,"['Writer-director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'exquisite', 'gem', 'movie', 'love', 'letter', 'city', 'Tokyo', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'captures', 'garish', 'glory', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'more', 'promise', 'made', 'Coppola', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'major', 'new', 'filmmaker', 'voice', 'own.Bill', 'Murray', 'given', 'many', 'memorable', 'performances', 'career', 'may', 'never', 'top', 'work', 'here', 'Murray', 'was', 'deservedly', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'lonely', 'washed-up', 'movie', 'star', 'Tokyo', 'shoot', 'whiskey', 'commercial', 'Bob', 'career', 'marriage', 'have', 'gone', 'sour', 'phone', 'home', 'wife', 'children', 'are', 'barely', 'interested', 'Murray', 'best', 'moments', 'come', 'when', 'be', 'unaware', 'acting', 'when', 'camera', 'face', 'filled', 'such', 'sadness', 'heart', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'filled', 'many', 'tiny', 'moments', 'make', 'up', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'seldom', 'captured', 'so', 'effectively', 'film.Suffering', 'insomnia', 'lonely', 'Tokyo', 'hotel', 'Bob', 'twentysomething', 'Charlotte', 'played', 'beautiful', 'subtlety', 'grace', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Charlotte', 'been', 'married', 'two', 'years', 'video', 'director', 'who', 'hardly', 'presence', 'Charlotte', 'alone', 'drifting', 'night', 'Bob', 'strike', 'up', 'friendship', 'expecting', 'May-December', 'love', 'story', 'are', 'watching', 'wrong', 'film', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'have', 'many', 'late', 'night', 'conversations', 'what', 'life', 'relate', 'one', 'very', 'precious', 'way.Murray', 'Johansson', 'play', 'unique', 'relationship', 'perfectly', 'making', 'see', 'humanity', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'how', 'loneliness', 'reach', 'out', 'touch', 'one', 'lives', 'bond', 'probably', 'could', 'not', 'exist', 'world', 'hotel', 'know', 'So', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'spend', 'time', 'can', 'other', 'eventually', 'must', 'end', 'ending', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'oner', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'perfect', 'Bob', 'leaving', 'return', 'family', 'whispers', 'something', 'Charlotte', 'ear', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'hear', 'what', 'better', 'way.Bob', 'Charlotte', 'part', 'company', 'knowing', 'have', 'shared', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'changed', 'lives', 'darkness', 'midnight', 'Tokyo', 'two', 'lost', 'people', 'found', 'one', 'wondrous', 'watch', 'very', 'moody', 'quiet', 'beautiful', 'film', 'may', 'get', 'antsy', 'slow', 'pace', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'miracle', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'performance', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Oscar-winning', 'achievement']",Lost in Translation

I hated this movie (with a passion) the first time I saw it.

You have young people making the transition to being an adult. You have middle aged people going though their mid life transition. All of this set in Japan, a country making a transition into the modern world, yet holding on to some of their traditions. Even a clip about an older man making a transiton to being old.Scarlett Johansson continues to do outstanding work, and like Bill, you connect with them as someone you like.This movie is an attempt to establish communication between rich and poor, privileged and common, young and old, east and west. It deals with how much gets lost in the translation. I found the bonus material on thie DVD to be better than the film itself. The bonus clips give you more of a feel for the city of Tokyo and the people of Japan.Bill Murrray does comedy and this film is an attempt for him to do a bit of drama and a bit of romance. The question was: How much to hold him back from being funny. I think they held him back to much and tried to make the movie a bit to serious and thus they ended up with a three instead of a four star rating. But they were right I believe to maintain some artistic integerty and not try to go for all out comedy so as to over due it.Everyone did a really good job, but as the title suggests somethings get lost in translation and that is what this movie is all about. Dealing with what gets lost in translations, along with a secondary theme of dealing with lifes transitions.Another problem is they ignore Lazarus, you never see the homeless person, and your not introduced to his perspective. To much gets lots in translation, so that you never really get to know the people of Tokyo. But you get a lot more of a introduction in the Bonus material than you do the movie itself.Otherwise they get the job done and deliver on what they say they were going to deliver on. Of course these are all top rated professionals, so you would expect that they are going to persevere and accomplish what they set out to do. Even as they all deal with lifes transitions and struggle with what gets lost in translation along the way.This is a film that can be studied as a work that shows what can be done with a small budget and a small crew.

Sofia Coppola's marriage to Spike Jonze was not going very well, and this movie was something like a mind-release for the young director. If she tried to pass on to the audience a feeling of impotent boredom, then she did a very good job.The story revolves around a week or so in the lives of two people: a somewhat decadent movie star named Bob Harris, played by an aged and dry Bill Murray, and a young girl whose marriage isn't going so well, played by the incredibly convincent Scarlett Johansson. They meet in Tokyo, where Murray is shooting a whisky commercial, and Scarlett is passing most of her time in the hotel room while her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) goes out to do his job.The movie is well enacted and has some sincerely hilarious scenes. Bill Murray is great as the midlife crisis striken man. The scene where he's shotting the commercial is fantastic. The best thing about ""Lost in translation"" is that it is simple, and real. The relationship between the two characters, while odd, is realistic, and I think most of the people watching the movie could relate to what they were watching on screen.The only thing I didn't like is that ""Lost in translation"" is, at times, too slow, and tiresome as well. As I've said before, I think Sofia Coppola wanted to transmit the boredom she felt to the scenes, and this she made properly.

Shudder to think....)I loved the scenes of Bill Murray dealing with the Directors of the Scotch commercials. Very funny.There were also great ""I don't fit here"" sequences, wordless yet among the most strongly stated of the movie.One sort of fun-review-aside, I smiled when I watched a Bonus Feature of Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola hanging out in Rome, it looks like they are standing on a patio or something. The contrast between old-world Rome and neon flavored Tokyo was astonishing - and since I watched this bonus AFTER the movie, I was also reminded of how much Scarlett Johansson's performance seemed to echo Sofia Coppola, the writer-director herself.Both have soft voices, appear very present yet just a wee bit unattached... spend a lot of time just thinking (from all appearances) and doesn't show much emotion yet we somehow sense there is a lot of feeling going on in there... somewhere.In fact - that last paragraph is a passable description of the movie itself.",4,I Know It Is In Here...

Scarlett Johansson plays the wife of a young photographer who is doing a shoot in Tokyo, but who is too busy to pay much attention to her.  They are both sleep-deprived and culture-shocked which seems like a good start to a relationship.  The movie pokes a lot of fun at the differences between American and Japanese cultures, from Bill Murray towering over the diminutive Japanese in an elevator, to a Japanese director who is trying to get Murray to look like Frank Sinatra of the &quot;lat pack&quot; (rat pack.)  Murray makes the most of these scenes and is hilarious as he gets carried away on an exercise machine and watches Japanese ladies prancing in a pool in a water aerobics class.  The movie is slow at the beginning and I kept wondering, &quot;What is the point to all of this&quot;, but eventually the developing friendship between Murray and Johannson is a joy to behold and it doesn't need much plot to sustain it.  Some of the characters seem unnecessarily shrill, such as the movie star friend of Johannson's husband and the manic talk-show host who interviews Murray, but perhaps these characters just serve as a contrast to the laid-back and somewhat melancholy main characters.

Well, to be quite honest...it isn't.I understand where this movie was trying to go.  It was attempting to show that sometimes even the smallest interaction with another human being can lead to major changes in your life.  I know this, but i was still disappointed.  My major gripes with the movie can be summed up in two points though.One: I can appreciate a moment of silence in a movie...but this one had WAY too many.  While Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson each have their moments of great acting, I was too annoyed with the endless silences and long pauses that the movie seemed plagued with to really notice them.  A silent moment to allow the viewer to absorb the visual angle of the movie or as an emphasis on an emotional connection is a wonderful device, but when more than half the movie is completely silent and devoid of character i feel it becomes cliche' and melodramatic.Two: I honestly did not care about their characters.  I am supposed to feel sorry for Charlotte and Bob, but they are both such selfish and flighty people that i found it difficult to empathyze with them.  Perhaps this was the point of the movie, but i feel that i've been cheated when i watch a movie and find no emotional connection with the characters.In short (yeah, right).

His path intersects with that of Scarlett Johnson, who plays a lonely wife that is in Tokyo with her photographer boyfriend (Giovanni Ribisi) who leaves her alone all day then takes off completely for a few days while he is off shooting a rock band somewhere.  The beauty of this film is the way that Tokyo is portrayed by the director, Sofia Coppola, as well as the Murray and Johnson's reactions to the very foreign and seemingly bizarre world of Japan.The film is funny is subtle ways: facial reactions, snippy comments from Murray, body language.  But the most beautiful part of the film is the way that Murray and Johnson find each other, and common ground, in a very surreal environment.  There is always underlying sexual tension, but that is the point and not the point at the same time.At the end of the film, I was left wondering how often a person meets other people at inconvenient or strange times in both their lives and how those seemingly missed connections affect the rest of both people's lives, as well as the eternal question of ""what if?""",4,"Hilarious, brutual and touching",1065052800,"10 2, 2003",2003,1348,"['film', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'finest', 'performance', 'yet', 'coming', 'close', 'second', 'run', 'depressed', 'middle', 'aged', 'husband/dad/businessman', 'Rushmore', '.Murray', 'aging', '70s', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'flown', 'Japan', 'star', 'series', 'commericals', 'ad', 'campaigns', 'Japanese', 'whiskey', 'path', 'intersects', 'Scarlett', 'Johnson', 'who', 'lonely', 'wife', 'Tokyo', 'photographer', 'boyfriend', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'who', 'alone', 'day', 'then', 'off', 'completely', 'few', 'days', 'shooting', 'rock', 'band', 'somewhere', 'beauty', 'film', 'way', 'Tokyo', 'portrayed', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'as', 'well', 'Murray', 'Johnson', 'reactions', 'very', 'foreign', 'seemingly', 'bizarre', 'world', 'Japan.The', 'film', 'funny', 'subtle', 'ways', 'facial', 'reactions', 'snippy', 'comments', 'Murray', 'body', 'language', 'most', 'beautiful', 'part', 'film', 'way', 'Murray', 'Johnson', 'find', 'other', 'common', 'ground', 'very', 'surreal', 'environment', 'always', 'underlying', 'sexual', 'tension', 'point', 'not', 'point', 'same', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'often', 'person', 'other', 'people', 'inconvenient', 'strange', 'times', 'lives', 'how', 'seemingly', 'missed', 'connections', 'affect', 'rest', 'people', 'lives', 'as', 'well', 'eternal', 'question', 'what']",Lost in Translation

You probably won't enjoy the movie.This is a piece that reveals those icky insecurities and quirks that we all carry and transfer to our relationships.

All the details of life are subject to translation or interpretation and exactly what the movie is about -- the miscommunication small and large that guide us, govern us and control us.The characters are lost, emotionally, as they try to figure out what they are looking for in life, in careers, in the bottom of booze bottles and in other people.

619559,A1XXBVRRNGBG5Y,B00005JMJ4,kendall lopere,"[80, 142]","Lost In Translation is, in many ways, the cinematic representation of lying on your back in a meadow with your best friends, day-dreaming and watching the clouds go by.  Frankly it's not something I could do everyday, but it's not a waste of time and it's definitely enjoyable while it lasts.L.I.T. doesn't require you to think very much; as previous reviewers have pointed out, there isn't much of a plot. However, everyone seems to think this is a bad thing - why must every movie have a defined plot?  Why can't a movie just drift along and entertain us gently without resorting to tactics designed to shock, disgust or scare us.The movie is beautifully put together and the cinematography is stunning. While others may point out a lack of depth in the character, I believe the characters purposefully remain closed to us, much like a stranger you might run into on holiday occasionally and shoot the breeze with, but never really feel like you know.Coppola also resists the temptation to bring things to a traditional, neat, Hollywood ending, which I personally felt was fantastic - I had no desire to see a naked Bill Murray sweat all over a beautiful young girl who could be his grand-daughter.  The conclusion of the movie itself is similarly perfect - why not let the viewer make up his/her own mind as to how they want the film to conclude?  Do we need to be spoon-fed everything?The depiction of Tokyo itself is marvelous, and has left me with a strong desire to visit as soon as possible.  It seems so futuristic, and really hits home how much more technologically advanced the Japanese are compared to us, while simultaneously maintaining an awesome sense of tradition.This brings me to my next point - the portrayal of the Japanese people themselves is borderline racist. Many of the jokes, especially at the start of the movie revolve around the fact that Japanese people are shorter than westerners, and can't speak English as well. Ha Ha.  The double-standard implicit in the film's mindset is also spelled out explicitly when, at the start of the film, the joke is on the Japanese director, for not realizing Bill Murray can't understand a word he says - while at the end of the film the joke is on the Japanese chef, who can't understand what Bill Murray is saying to him.  The suggestion that ""shall we just wait around until a customer comes in and orders [black toe]?"" is also mindboggling.

619560,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00005JMJ4,Kenji Fujishima,"[5, 7]","In my lifetime (and keep in mind, I'm only 18 years old, so it hasn't been a long lifetime), I have never seen anything like the kind of reaction Sofia Coppola's LOST IN TRANSLATION has received on its home video release. I saw this movie in the theater, and I liked it a lot, and plenty of professional film critics did too. But apparently the majority opinion of the public after this movie was released on home video has been the total opposite. Thus you have reviews like the one in the Spotlight Reviews section written by gregy55902, which, while admittedly well-written, is so disagreeable that I would be surprised if his favorite movies weren't the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy---movies about wizards and elves and dwarves that, while certainly well-made, hardly have anything to do with &quot;real life,&quot; and thus would find favor with this viewer who seemingly demands pure shallow escapism from his entertainment and can't (or is simply unwilling to) at the very least appreciate movies that try to be much more meaningful for us. If he wasn't moved by these two lonely characters and touched by their bittersweet separation at the end, then he probably just didn't want to be (since real life apparently doesn't belong to the movies, in his humble opinion---it doesn't make for exciting, mindblowing entertainment).I'm sure he is not the only fellow who thinks this way, though, so I'll just leave it at that and call it his loss. But boy, is he wrong about the acting! What was this man expecting, Bill Murray to be consistently howling and sobbing with despair? The beauty of his performance as Bob Harris here is precisely that he refuses to overdo the feelings of despair his character must feel about his marriage, about the path his own life has taken, etc. It would certainly be the wrong acting choice, blatantly overacting in a movie that is meant to be realistic and with a character that is meant to be introspective. The great thing about Bill Murray's performance is that we always respond to Bob Harris the character, not Bill Murray the actor. (If he's improvising certain lines, he is always improvising as his character, and not injecting artificial flashes of his usual comic personality.) gregy55902, if you think it is so easy to be &quot;real&quot; in front of a camera with full knowledge that there is a camera recording your every move, then perhaps you should try film acting yourself. It is certainly NOT as easy as it looks.I would concede that maybe the film errs in perhaps not going far enough with the Bob Harris-Charlotte relationship. There is one scene, set in a restaurant, in which Charlotte's anger at Harris after he had accidentally slept with a woman the night before is palpable, and they both say hurtful things to each other. But that gets resolved a little too quickly for my taste---although their quick making-up perhaps shows how much they truly need each other. And the shots at Japanese culture are indeed cheap and facile (I should know; I'm half-Japanese myself). Despite all that, most of what is in LOST IN TRANSLATION in its final form is so real, and touches so deeply that I am sure I could watch it again and feel the same way.Apparently, though, this movie is not for all tastes. I would still urge any adventurous moviegoer out there to at least give this movie a shot. Try to take it for what it is---a quiet yet  uplifting comedy-drama about two lost souls in a foreign land who don't necessarily do anything extraordinarily significant together and yet separate from each other feeling a little better about themselves anyway---and maybe you'll find it as moving (if not wholly perfect) as I did.

The writing and directing is this film is authentic and brilliant.  The characters are beautifully brought to life by Scarlett and Bill, who fully deserve the critical praise they've already recieved.  This film is purely authentic.  These characters are real humans you feel like you know and understand on some level, regardless of what you think of them.  The journey is made up of what seems to be real life experiences, rather than contrived Hollywood fantasy.  This is the best film of 2003.To clarify something, Sofia Coppola got funding for this film by pre-selling the distribution rights.  According to Filmmaker Magazine, Bill Murray did this for ""No Money"".  Whether that means scale or on deferrment I don't know.  What I do know is that people saying that Daddy Coppola is responsible for the funding or critical acclaim is just fantasy.  She did risky funding all on her own to ensure final cut, and I'm glad she did.This is not a Hollywood movie, and the naysayers are clearly used to the latest romantic comedy which recycles the same formula over and over again.

The fact that both parties had significant problems in their personal life aided and abetted this engaging partnership.This is the summary message of this movie, in my opinion -- that it is possible to throw off all of life's problems, regardless of their enormous nature, by finding the right person in the right circumstance. This is what the cohorts did in Japan in ""Lost In Translation"" and I believe they did it very well.I've enjoyed many of Bill Murray's past films and liked his modest, subtle style in this movie. I believe it fit well with the overall scheme.

It had won a handful of Golden Globes, and Sofia Coppola was the favorite for the Oscar for original screenplay. However, when it was over it left me wondering just what everyone saw in it. Particularly Bill Murray's performance -- it seemed to me all he did was sit around with a sad look on his face while he recited some dialogue in a bland tone. Apparently these days it's enough to win awards.The main fault of this movie is its lack of plot. Lack of plot doesn't necessarily mean a movie is done for -- if it can make up for it with interesting and engaging characters. &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; neither has a plot nor interesting characters. Simply put, it's a boring movie. I do admire it, though -- the shots of Tokyo are breathtaking, and Scarlett Johansson shows amazing potential as an actress. Since she's only 19, we have many great things to expect from her. Some of the best shots of the movie are simply of her sitting in her hotel room, curled up as if to guard herself from the world. However, she is simply not enough to save this movie from being one of the most boring I have ever seen. Watch it if you're wanting to simply sit and admire the filmmaking.

619574,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMJ4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 11]","After watching &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; the thought that most stuck out in my mind was that this was Sofia Coppola's film.  A lot of the talk about the film before the Oscars was about Bill Murray's performance, especially after he won the Golden Globe, but I did not think it was his best work.  I would still insist that it was &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; where he displayed the greatest range and had his most heartfelt moments (i.e., the last night with Rita).  As for Scarlett Johansson, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; was not even her best performance of 2003.  That would be her role as Griet in &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring.&quot;  This is not to say that the performances by Murray and Johansson in this film are not excellent, but simply that both have done better.However, I do not think you can say the same for Coppola, since &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is the second major film she has written and directed, the first being 1999's &quot;The Virgin Suicide.&quot;  The key difference is that this time Coppola is doing an original story and not an adaptation.  The story is about two lost souls who meet in a Tokyo hotel and spend the night together, but not in the convention meaning of the phrase.  Murray is Bob Harris, a movie star who has come to Japan to make a series of commercials for Suntory whiskey for big bucks, and while this keeps him far away from his wife and kids his phone calls home suggest his marriage is as much an obligation as this gig.  Johansson is Charlotte, who has been dragged by her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi) on an assignment and is left to entertain herself while he is running around taking photographs of some minor Hollywood starlet (Anna Faris), and perhaps doing more.Our expectation is that Bob and Charlotte are going to end up in bed together, but Copolla is playing with our expectations.  After all, two people can cling to each other through psychological intimacy as well as the physical.  These two people are also in the middle of a neon colored alien environment with the late night Tokyo of karaoke bars and pachinko parlors.  The dark hotel bar becomes a sort of womb that these two characters have reentered and are going to emerge from at the end of the film changed in some way that Coppola, in a masterstroke, decides not to share with the audience.  Bob and Charlotte have their own lessons learned from this experience and Coppola leaves it to the audience you draw their own conclusions.&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a meditation, and for those who have not been married or who have never been a stranger in a strange land the realities of this fictional tale may well be lost.  One of the reasons it stand out so prominently compared to the other films nominated for Best Picture Oscars in 2003 is that it is an intimate film while the others were either spectacles (&quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; and &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;) or larger than life stories (&quot;Mystic River&quot; and &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;).

619575,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JMJ4,Lawyeraau,"[1, 3]","This is a film that both my daughter and I were interested in seeing, given the acclaim that Bill Murray's performance had drawn. Moreover, the film itself had drawn critical acclaim. So, when my daughter was home from college one weekend, we decided to hunker down and watch it together. When we both fell asleep while watching it, we decided that we were just tired. So, we decided to give it another go around the next evening. Well, unlike love, it was not much better the second time around, though we managed to avoid falling asleep, yet again.Quite frankly, if Sophia Coppola, the writer and director of this film, were not the daughter of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola, I am convinced that this film would have quickly vanished without a trace. In fact, I doubt that it would even have been made. When her acting career fizzled, after making her less than memorable acting debut in her father's film ""Godfather III"", Sophia Coppola apparently turned her hand to directing and was let loose upon an unsuspecting public.While this film has good production values, it simply meanders along in a loosey-goosey sort of way. If focuses upon two individuals, Americans who find themselves in Tokyo, alienated from their surroundings and, seemingly, from life in general. One of these individuals is Bob Harris, a film actor on a career downslide, who now finds himself shilling whiskey in Japan for mega bucks, while his movie career is at an impasse. The other is a beautiful twenty-five year old woman, a Yale Graduate with a degree in philosophy, who is in Japan with her husband, a photographer who is working on a shooting assignment.Bob Harris, played with wry bemusement by Bill Murray, is a man who is alienated from his family and, quite frankly, just plain lonely. His is a stark universe, as he seems to have a myopic view on life, seeing little beyond his luxury hotel's bar, where he like to go and drink. Charlotte, played with surprising maturity and flair by eighteen year old Scarlett Johansson, feels bereft and set adrift, as she struggles to keep herself occupied while her husband is ostensibly working. It is these two souls whose worlds collide, coloring their perspectives on life when an unlikely bond forms between them.The film, which takes place in Tokyo, Japan, appears to mock the Japanese. Its stereotypic portrayal of the Japanese people, generally as buffoons, is reprehensible and a cheap joke. Sophia Coppola apparently thinks that the way Japanese people speak English is funny, as it is a running, unfunny joke through out the film. Since the film takes place in Japan, perhaps it might have been funnier to see Bob (or Charlotte) attempt to speak Japanese, rather than turn Bob into the quintessential ugly American.The film meanders along lacking a definitive narrative and any real profundity of thought. While there is definition about the characters' exterior selves, the film never delves into their inner selves in defining their present state of affairs. There are no big or traditional cinematic moments. Unfortunately, there are no small ones either, as there is really no introspection by either of the two protagonists. This is a film that viewers will either love or hate. I fall into the latter category.

Murray's performance is excellent and he manages to even outdue his work in Rushmore. Johansson's work is stunning and she manages to match Murray note for note throughout the picture. By being able to pair off with Murray in such an equal manner, the relationship that developes is so much more engrossing. After watching Lost in Translation, the thing that struck me the most was the uncanny mood that the film creates. This mood lingered with me long after I had left the theater. It doesn't take a trip to Japan to become lost in the translation of everyday life.The worst problem with the DVD is the forced previews. This is the first disc I've ever owned where you couldn't just push the menu button to skip the previews. I don't even think skipping the track works. The previews actually were for decent films, but seeing this everytime you put in the disc is really annoying.Video quality is good, but not great. Color and contrast were okay. Shimmering was not a problem. Unfortunately the picture seemed pretty soft. Although the cinematography tends to push an intended hazy look, there we some shots that seemed almost blurry that I don't recall looking this way in the theater. Beware there is a fullscreen version out there. There is no excuse for getting that because the film is shot in 1:85:1, so no matter how small your TV is your picture is going to be larger enough. I can understand, but don't condone the purchase of full screen editions for films shot in wider aspect ratios, because on a small TV the picture is barely visible.Sound was quite good. There are many intriguing sound edits in the picture and the track was of good quality. Be sure to listend to the manipulation of the music when Murray carries Johansson back to her room.Extras were a mixed bag. The interview with Murray and Coppola is very strange. It is shot in Rome on top of a building and the whole time Coppola barely speaks and Murrary's shadow covers her. Murray is straight forward and doesn't joke around. It is not very enlightening. The Behind the Scenes documentary is over long with lots of dull spots, but there are several enjoyable moments in it. For one thing Murray is hilirious and his off screen antics are a riot. The music video is boring, watching someone doing nothing but walk around Tokyo for an entire song gets tiresome, even if it's Scarlett! The deleted scenes are mostly extensions that add little, but be sure to check the robot scene. This scene is very weird, but totally fits with the mood of the film, too bad it didn't make the cut. There is also an extended clip of Murray on the &quot;Johnny Carson of Japan&quot; show. This is a riot, check out what Murray does with the &quot;surprise&quot; he finds in the box.Lost in Translation is a great film, maybe not a classic, but time will tell. Coppola has proved herself as a skilled filmmaker and has removed the sting of her performance in Godfather III. Johansson has the potential of being a great movie star of the future as long as she continues to select quality projects like this. The Focus Features DVD has an okay transfer that is rather soft with average extras and a terrible set of unavoidable previews before the picture starts.",4,DVD Review,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,3427,"['Lost', 'Translation', 'definately', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'films', 'Focus', 'Features', 'DVD', 'release', 'far', 'perfect.The', 'film', 'delightful', 'work', 'script', 'heart', 'funnybone', 'Murray', 'performance', 'excellent', 'even', 'outdue', 'work', 'Rushmore', 'Johansson', 'work', 'stunning', 'match', 'Murray', 'note', 'note', 'picture', 'being', 'able', 'pair', 'off', 'Murray', 'such', 'equal', 'manner', 'relationship', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'engrossing', 'watching', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'thing', 'struck', 'most', 'was', 'uncanny', 'mood', 'film', 'mood', 'lingered', 'long', 'had', 'left', 'theater', ""n't"", 'take', 'trip', 'Japan', 'become', 'lost', 'translation', 'everyday', 'life.The', 'worst', 'problem', 'DVD', 'forced', 'previews', 'first', 'disc', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'owned', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'push', 'menu', 'button', 'skip', 'previews', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'skipping', 'track', 'previews', 'actually', 'were', 'decent', 'films', 'seeing', 'everytime', 'put', 'disc', 'really', 'annoying.Video', 'quality', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'Color', 'contrast', 'were', 'okay', 'Shimmering', 'was', 'not', 'problem', 'Unfortunately', 'picture', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'soft', 'cinematography', 'push', 'intended', 'hazy', 'look', 'shots', 'seemed', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'looking', 'way', 'theater', 'Beware', 'fullscreen', 'version', 'there', 'excuse', 'getting', 'film', 'shot', '1:85:1', 'so', 'no', 'matter', 'how', 'small', 'TV', 'picture', 'going', 'be', 'larger', 'enough', 'can', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'condone', 'purchase', 'full', 'screen', 'editions', 'films', 'shot', 'wider', 'aspect', 'ratios', 'small', 'TV', 'picture', 'barely', 'visible.Sound', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'are', 'many', 'intriguing', 'sound', 'edits', 'picture', 'track', 'was', 'good', 'quality', 'Be', 'sure', 'listend', 'manipulation', 'music', 'when', 'Murray', 'Johansson', 'back', 'room.Extras', 'were', 'mixed', 'bag', 'interview', 'Murray', 'Coppola', 'very', 'strange', 'shot', 'Rome', 'top', 'building', 'whole', 'time', 'Coppola', 'barely', 'Murrary', 'shadow', 'Murray', 'straight', 'forward', ""n't"", 'joke', 'around', 'not', 'very', 'enlightening', 'Scenes', 'documentary', 'long', 'lots', 'dull', 'spots', 'are', 'several', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'one', 'thing', 'Murray', 'hilirious', 'off', 'screen', 'antics', 'are', 'riot', 'music', 'video', 'boring', 'watching', 'someone', 'doing', 'nothing', 'walk', 'Tokyo', 'entire', 'song', 'tiresome', 'even', 'Scarlett', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'mostly', 'extensions', 'add', 'little', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'robot', 'scene', 'scene', 'very', 'weird', 'totally', 'mood', 'film', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'cut', 'also', 'extended', 'clip', 'Murray', 'quot', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'Japan', 'quot', 'show', 'riot', 'check', 'out', 'what', 'Murray', 'quot', 'surprise', 'quot', 'box.Lost', 'Translation', 'great', 'film', 'maybe', 'not', 'classic', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'Coppola', 'proved', 'skilled', 'filmmaker', 'removed', 'sting', 'performance', 'Godfather', 'III', 'Johansson', 'potential', 'being', 'great', 'movie', 'star', 'future', 'as', 'long', 'select', 'quality', 'projects', 'Focus', 'Features', 'DVD', 'okay', 'transfer', 'rather', 'soft', 'average', 'extras', 'terrible', 'set', 'unavoidable', 'previews', 'picture']",Lost in Translation

Subtle moments of connectedness are found in the midst of interminable stretches of meaninglessness and routine. Those moments, like this film, are honest and fleeting. Without really looking, we pass them by completely, so focused on things we're told give purpose and value to living. Like making money and being meaningfully bound to another person through marriage, and finding a purpose for life.What happens, then, when we're without the signposts and markers that give us comfort, serving as shorthand to ground us, unquestioning, in our sense of self as marked by days, minutes, hours of familiar, unthinking motions?  We cease to really live, and just exist, lost.If we're as lucky as Bob and Charlotte we can be found.It requires a different vantage point, a fresh eye that will see in us what we're too harried, too comfortable, too familiar to view. But someone who rekindles that sense of infinite potential, limitless possibility by seeing another through new eyes is a benefactor. They can renew, just by letting us see ourselves through their eyes.In ""Lost in Translation,"" we see Bob Harris, fading former movie star, a man resigned to cameo appearances in his own life, through the eyes of Charlotte. Flawed, cynical and world weary, he's as detached from his own life as Tokyo is from its past. It takes a real connection to someone just as lost to awaken Bob from his self-imposed slumber. . .it takes really connecting with another human being for him to see his life hasn't lost possibility and hope.Murray has never been better, using his sad clown appearance to perfection and minimizing the tendency to go for a sight gag when an emotional resonance is more important. He is jaded. He is lost. Worse, he doesn't care.All of that changes, for the better, when he meets Scarlett Johansen's Charlotte. Matching and bettering his personal dissatisfaction, through her own displacement Charlotte reminds Bob that time shouldn't be wasted and life tossed away. At first, he sees her possibility. Eventually, he remembers his own.A quiet, simple study on the most basic of human needs - the need to be appreciated and to find yourself again - this movie continues to be a painful, stripped down, honest depiction of life where great things happen, somewhere in between what's planned.",5,Painful,1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,2333,"['life', 'film', 'meanders', 'Subtle', 'moments', 'connectedness', 'are', 'found', 'midst', 'interminable', 'stretches', 'meaninglessness', 'routine', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'honest', 'fleeting', 'really', 'looking', 'pass', 'completely', 'so', 'focused', 'things', ""'re"", 'told', 'give', 'purpose', 'value', 'living', 'making', 'money', 'being', 'meaningfully', 'bound', 'person', 'marriage', 'finding', 'purpose', 'life.What', 'then', 'when', ""'re"", 'signposts', 'markers', 'give', 'comfort', 'serving', 'shorthand', 'ground', 'unquestioning', 'sense', 'self', 'marked', 'days', 'minutes', 'hours', 'familiar', 'unthinking', 'motions', 'cease', 'really', 'live', 'just', 'exist', 'lost.If', ""'re"", 'as', 'lucky', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'can', 'be', 'found.It', 'different', 'vantage', 'point', 'fresh', 'eye', 'will', 'see', 'what', ""'re"", 'too', 'harried', 'too', 'comfortable', 'too', 'familiar', 'view', 'someone', 'who', 'sense', 'infinite', 'potential', 'limitless', 'possibility', 'seeing', 'new', 'eyes', 'benefactor', 'can', 'renew', 'just', 'letting', 'see', 'eyes.In', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'see', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'fading', 'former', 'movie', 'star', 'man', 'resigned', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'own', 'life', 'eyes', 'Charlotte', 'Flawed', 'cynical', 'world', 'weary', 'as', 'detached', 'own', 'life', 'Tokyo', 'past', 'real', 'connection', 'someone', 'just', 'as', 'lost', 'awaken', 'Bob', 'self-imposed', 'slumber', '.it', 'really', 'connecting', 'human', 'being', 'see', 'life', ""n't"", 'lost', 'possibility', 'hope.Murray', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'using', 'sad', 'clown', 'appearance', 'perfection', 'minimizing', 'tendency', 'go', 'sight', 'gag', 'when', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'more', 'important', 'jaded', 'lost', 'Worse', ""n't"", 'care.All', 'changes', 'better', 'when', 'Scarlett', 'Johansen', 'Charlotte', 'Matching', 'bettering', 'personal', 'dissatisfaction', 'own', 'displacement', 'Charlotte', 'Bob', 'time', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'wasted', 'life', 'tossed', 'away', 'first', 'possibility', 'Eventually', 'own.A', 'quiet', 'simple', 'study', 'most', 'basic', 'human', 'needs', 'need', 'be', 'appreciated', 'find', 'again', 'movie', 'be', 'painful', 'stripped', 'down', 'honest', 'depiction', 'life', 'where', 'great', 'things', 'happen', 'somewhere', 'what', 'planned']",Lost in Translation

They experience Japan together.  And the audience gets a peak of what it's like to be a stranger in a strange land where a lot gets lost in translation.  Having been to Japan myself, it reminded me of the feelings of not quite being able to communicate.  And the funny mistakes that are inevitable when cultures and languages are so different.Starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson as the two lost souls, their performances are nothing less than brilliant.  I laughed out loud at times.  And at other times I was moved by each of their predicaments with their marriages and their search for meaning in their lives.  Always, I was delighted with the film. There's a feeling of freshness throughout, as if the characters were just opening their eyes for the first time.  It was well paced and the cinematography captured the reality of modern Japan.The DVD had some unexpected extras too - most notably a half-hour documentary about the making of the film.  It followed the film crew from Day One and I loved being steeped in all that behind-the-scenes film lore.  Sophia Coppola was the writer and director.  She won an academy award for the best screenplay written directly for the screen.

Bill Murray is Bob, a world weary actor who is in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial. Bob, who was a movie star in the 70s, obviously hates being lowered to this level of the show business hierarchy. I grew tired of his perpetual attitude of being oppressed and put-upon. He reveals at one point that he's being paid two million dollars for something like a week's work, and most people have to do far more unpleasant things for a lot less compensation. Bob meets Charlotte, the much younger wife of a self absorbed photographer. I was not all that enchanted with either Bob or Charlotte, but virtually everyone else in the film is a caricature. Charlotte's husband is the conveniently dumb spouse (convenient in a movie about a possible affair between married people); there's also a dumb blonde actress from L.A. (what a concept) who distracts Charlotte's husband. Finally, there is Bob's wife, who we only hear on the phone, who only seems to care about things like the color of carpets. Then there are the multitude of Japanese stereotypes. Most of the humor in the film is the provincial kind where American audiences are supposed to identify with their compatriots, trapped in a land full of wacky foreigners, many of whom are so ignorant that they can't speak proper English! I'm not so PC as to oppose ethnic humor, especially if it's funny, but the spectacle of Asians mispronouncing words in English is just a little old by now. There are also several scenes in which people speak long Japanese sentences to Bill or Charlotte as though completely unaware of the fact that they can't understand it. I suppose there's just no end to the ignorance of people outside the English speaking world. I don't feel that it's unreasonable to stress the language issue here, because the very title of the film implies that it's meant to be of central importance. True, the language barrier can be disconcerting, but, first of all, I'm sure Tokyo has many people who are fluent in English, and secondly, someone on Bob's budget could afford a translator. As for Bob and Charlotte, their interactions maintain the edge of people who are attracted to each other but not  ready to commit to a relationship. This is not a bad thing, but I feel that to get into the romantic mood of the movie you have to buy into the whole scenario of foreigners trapped in a foreign limbo, something along the lines of The Year of Living Dangerously maybe. Lost in Translation is nice to look at, with many great shots of night scenes in Tokyo and the surrounding countryside.

Lost in Translation is so beautiful, so touching, so hilarious, so deep, so entrancing/enchanting.  Sofia Coppola, who wrote and directed, fully deserved the Best Original Screenplay Oscar she received; Bill Murray also deserved the nod for Best Actor.Taking place in Japan (Tokyo and to a lesser extent Kyoto), the story is about a young, beautiful wife named Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) who has tagged along on a business trip to Tokyo with her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi).  Although Charlotte and John seem to have all the ingredients for a passionate marriage, John is neglectful of her in ways that are hard to pin down.  For one, although she spends half her screen time in her underpants, she and her husband don't seem to be having sex.  John is friends with a cute blond starlet.  John and Charlotte say ""I love you"" to each other many times during the movie - but it rings hollow, again, for a reason I can't put my finger on.Also staying at the fabulously posh Tokyo Park Hyatt is former action movie star Bob Harris (Bill Murray), who is in Tokyo to get paid a ton of money to star in a whiskey commericial.  Bob is miserable and can't wait to get out of Japan.  But as his agent says, Bob should stay and accept the invitation to be on the Japanese talk show, because you know there are no other invitations waiting in the States.Bob and Charlotte meet and form a strong friendship.  Their relationship is so amazing; you feel like you have had the same kind of relationship in the past.  The sweeping scenes of Tokyo are what make the movie so fantastic.  Lost in Translation just would not have been as captivating if it had been filmed in any other city.  The film also serves as a primer for anyone considering a trip to Tokyo.  You see the inside of a hospital, train stations, restaurants, video game arcade, and a shrine.  Not many Japanese know English, adding to the feeling of isolation of the Americans abroad in the film.  Even the hotel lounge club singer is so isolated and lonely; you can hear it in her first song.The DVD's extras include deleted scenes, which are delightful except for the extended press interview with the blond starlet, which is literally longer than the interview with Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray.  There is also ""Matthew's Big Hit TV,"" the Graham Norton-like Japanese host and his sophomoric ""talk show.""

That's fairly low for an Oscar-nominated film especially one as hyped as this one was.  Expressed numerically, that's 60%, fairly dismal on the rotten-vs.-fresh meter.  Interestingly, the film scored 94% on the real meter, which is based on the reviews of professional critics.  So it's pretty clear that the general public liked the movie a lot less than the critics.  Why would this be?It's the ""emperor's new clothes"" effect.  A bandwagon got rolling on this film and critics were scared to seem dumber than their colleagues, so they jumped on the bandwagon.  From my perspective, problems with the film included.1. It opened with a shot of Scarlett Johansen's butt, which, though often on display in the film  (Ms. Johansen went skirtless a lot), had nothing to so with the story.  The movie wasn't about butts or sex.  Or was it?  Audiences hate ambiguity. Critics love it.2.  The attraction between Murray and Johansen didn't work.  She was too young, beautiful, and vacant for him.  He was too old and too smart for her.  Only one thing pulled them together: the requirements of the script.  Once together, there was no onscreen chemistry.  So the relationship was unconvincing.3.  Murray seemed more tired than lonely or disoriented.  And he was rarely funny.4.  The ending was one of those unoriginal ride-off-in-the-sunset type things.5.  Few people in the real world believe Sofia Coppola is that much more talented as a director than she was as an actress.Overall, the movie was boring... except for that opening shot.",2,Loved by critics but public less enthused,1087776000,"06 21, 2004",2004,1641,"['time', 'write', 'review', 'overall', 'Amazon', 'customer', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'based', 'almost', '1500', 'reviews', 'fairly', 'low', 'Oscar-nominated', 'film', 'especially', 'one', 'as', 'hyped', 'one', 'was', 'Expressed', 'numerically', '60', '%', 'fairly', 'dismal', 'rotten-vs.-fresh', 'meter', 'Interestingly', 'film', 'scored', '94', '%', 'real', 'meter', 'based', 'reviews', 'professional', 'critics', 'pretty', 'clear', 'general', 'public', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'less', 'critics', 'Why', 'would', 'be', 'emperor', 'new', 'clothes', 'effect', 'bandwagon', 'got', 'rolling', 'film', 'critics', 'were', 'scared', 'seem', 'dumber', 'colleagues', 'jumped', 'bandwagon', 'perspective', 'problems', 'film', 'included.1', 'opened', 'shot', 'Scarlett', 'Johansen', 'butt', 'though', 'often', 'display', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Johansen', 'went', 'skirtless', 'lot', 'had', 'nothing', 'so', 'story', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'about', 'butts', 'sex', 'was', 'Audiences', 'hate', 'ambiguity', 'Critics', 'love', 'it.2', 'attraction', 'Murray', 'Johansen', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'beautiful', 'vacant', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'too', 'smart', 'Only', 'one', 'thing', 'pulled', 'together', 'requirements', 'script', 'Once', 'together', 'was', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'relationship', 'was', 'unconvincing.3', 'Murray', 'seemed', 'more', 'tired', 'lonely', 'disoriented', 'was', 'rarely', 'funny.4', 'ending', 'was', 'one', 'unoriginal', 'ride-off-in-the-sunset', 'type', 'things.5', 'Few', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'believe', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'much', 'more', 'talented', 'director', 'was', 'actress.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'boring', 'opening', 'shot']",Lost in Translation

This movie was so well written and acted, thoughtful, genuine, touching and incredibly romantic that any negative review I see must stem from the audience simply not understanding this movie. Of course if you want some rom-com, bang-wang predictable formula, this wont be the movie for you. The beauty of this piece lies in the subtleties of the performances and the portrayal of the characters. Bill Murray has outdone himself in terms of acting skill. He is superb in his role as the apathetic, bored, middle-aged movie star stuck in the artificial confines of some luxury hotel in Tokyo to do a whiskey commercial. He is always in character and he never, ever becomes Bill Murray for even just one second, resulting in a believable and powerful performance. This part was written for him and I doubt any other actor could have pulled off what he did. Scarlett Johansson has an innocence to her that is only complemented by her intelligence and the serenity she exhumes. They could not have cast anyone better for this part. In fact, Murray and Johansson have great chemistry, despite the almost thirty five years age difference between them.Murray plays Bob Harris. He's married and has children, but he feels stuck and tired. He is in Japan to do a commercial for money but his heart is not in it and he's lost his drive and seems mostly on autopilot when going about his business. His marriage is stagnant and his wife keeps sending him tile and wall-paper patterns to chose from but other than that doesnt really talk to him really or otherwise shows any interest in him as a person. She just says what needs to be said, like she was closing a business deal, and then hangs up. Charlotte (played by Johansson) is a Yale philosophy graduate in town with her her not particularly bright celebrity photographer husband John to whom she has been married for two years and who doesnt give her the time of day. She reflects on how her husband has changed during two years of marriage and how her own life lacks direction. Her husband, in fact, seems to have more in common with a light-headed starlet they meet in the hotel, than with his own wife. He even tells her that she needs to relax because ""not everyone went to Yale."" He then leaves her behind in the hotel while he is off for his assignment.People got this movie all wrong believing it to be about the friendship between two lonely people or that it is about traveling to far off lands and being homesick. Far from it. This is a love story. However, that is really beside the point because the beauty of this movie lies in how this love story is told. The protagonists dont do the obvious things expected in such movies like sleep with each other (even though they could) or otherwise have a steamy affair that ends with separation and tears. No. That would have been cheap and predictable.This movie is about two people who find themselves in the same place and time with contrasting perspectives. Each is afflicted by different yet parallel doubts about the course their life respectively is taking or has taken. These two are drawn to each other and able to be completely honest and unguarded with the other BECAUSE they are strangers without any messy attachment from the past. The conversations they have are at the heart of this and their loneliness is compounded by the noisy, chaotic, neon-filled Tokyo background which I think - despite crowds - is a very isolating and lonely place really.I loved this movie because it threw two unlikely people together and forged an unexpected, intense relationship. It is a story that is mostly about the things that aren't said and done, than about what is explicitly uttered. The ending is powerful because when he whispers something in her ear on the congested streets of Tokyo, we don't get to hear what it is nor do we ever find out. The effect is a strong ending that is not predictable but remains true to the film's elegance, subtlety and depth. As someone once said, maybe he gave her his phone number, or said he loved her. Or said she was a good person. Or thanked her. Or whispered, ""Had we but world enough, and time..."" and left her to look up the rest of it.",5,Deft Balance of Humor and Poignancy Makes it Both a Pleasurable and Melancholic Experience,1297296000,"02 10, 2011",2011,4403,"['dont', 'understand', 'negative', 'reviews', 'undoubtedly', 'coming', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'attention', 'span', 'Jersey', 'shore', 'generation', 'otherwise', 'feel', 'are', 'falling', 'coma', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'moving', 'MTV', 'pace', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'thoughtful', 'genuine', 'touching', 'incredibly', 'romantic', 'negative', 'review', 'see', 'must', 'stem', 'audience', 'simply', 'not', 'understanding', 'movie', 'course', 'want', 'rom-com', 'bang-wang', 'predictable', 'formula', 'wont', 'be', 'movie', 'beauty', 'piece', 'subtleties', 'performances', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'outdone', 'terms', 'acting', 'skill', 'superb', 'role', 'apathetic', 'bored', 'middle-aged', 'movie', 'star', 'stuck', 'artificial', 'confines', 'luxury', 'hotel', 'Tokyo', 'do', 'whiskey', 'commercial', 'always', 'character', 'never', 'ever', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'even', 'just', 'one', 'second', 'resulting', 'believable', 'powerful', 'performance', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'doubt', 'other', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'what', 'did', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'innocence', 'only', 'complemented', 'intelligence', 'serenity', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'cast', 'anyone', 'better', 'part', 'fact', 'Murray', 'Johansson', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'almost', 'thirty', 'five', 'years', 'age', 'difference', 'them.Murray', 'plays', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'married', 'children', 'stuck', 'tired', 'Japan', 'do', 'commercial', 'money', 'heart', 'not', 'lost', 'drive', 'mostly', 'autopilot', 'when', 'going', 'business', 'marriage', 'stagnant', 'wife', 'keeps', 'sending', 'tile', 'wall-paper', 'patterns', 'chose', 'other', 'really', 'talk', 'really', 'otherwise', 'interest', 'person', 'just', 'what', 'be', 'said', 'was', 'closing', 'business', 'deal', 'then', 'up', 'Charlotte', 'played', 'Johansson', 'Yale', 'philosophy', 'graduate', 'town', 'not', 'particularly', 'bright', 'celebrity', 'photographer', 'husband', 'John', 'whom', 'been', 'married', 'two', 'years', 'who', 'doesnt', 'give', 'time', 'day', 'how', 'husband', 'changed', 'two', 'years', 'marriage', 'how', 'own', 'life', 'direction', 'husband', 'fact', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'light-headed', 'starlet', 'meet', 'hotel', 'own', 'wife', 'even', 'relax', 'not', 'everyone', 'went', 'Yale', 'then', 'behind', 'hotel', 'assignment.People', 'got', 'movie', 'wrong', 'believing', 'be', 'friendship', 'two', 'lonely', 'people', 'traveling', 'far', 'off', 'lands', 'being', 'homesick', 'Far', 'love', 'story', 'However', 'really', 'beside', 'point', 'beauty', 'movie', 'how', 'love', 'story', 'told', 'protagonists', 'dont', 'do', 'obvious', 'things', 'expected', 'such', 'movies', 'sleep', 'other', 'even', 'could', 'otherwise', 'have', 'steamy', 'affair', 'separation', 'tears', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cheap', 'predictable.This', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'same', 'place', 'time', 'contrasting', 'perspectives', 'afflicted', 'different', 'yet', 'parallel', 'doubts', 'course', 'life', 'respectively', 'taking', 'taken', 'two', 'are', 'drawn', 'other', 'able', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'unguarded', 'other', 'are', 'strangers', 'messy', 'attachment', 'past', 'conversations', 'have', 'are', 'heart', 'loneliness', 'compounded', 'noisy', 'chaotic', 'neon-filled', 'Tokyo', 'background', 'think', 'crowds', 'very', 'isolating', 'lonely', 'place', 'really.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'threw', 'two', 'unlikely', 'people', 'together', 'forged', 'unexpected', 'intense', 'relationship', 'story', 'mostly', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'said', 'done', 'what', 'explicitly', 'uttered', 'ending', 'powerful', 'because', 'when', 'something', 'ear', 'congested', 'streets', 'Tokyo', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hear', 'what', 'do', 'ever', 'find', 'out', 'effect', 'strong', 'ending', 'not', 'predictable', 'true', 'film', 'elegance', 'subtlety', 'depth', 'someone', 'once', 'said', 'maybe', 'gave', 'phone', 'number', 'said', 'loved', 'said', 'was', 'good', 'person', 'thanked', 'whispered', 'Had', 'world', 'enough', 'time', 'left', 'look', 'up', 'rest']",Lost in Translation

The main characters are both lost in Japan, unmoored and lonely, tired, unable to sleep, jet-lagged and confused. Coppola captures this ethos perfectly. The setting is magnificent- a luxurious but cold hotel in Tokyo and the lights/sounds/swirling/frenetic activity in the streets below. Bill Murray nails the jaded Bob and his midlife crisis perfectly. Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte is just realizing that her marriage is not all she expected it to be and that no marriage can provide her with the life direction she is seeking. Charlotte and Bob are both intelligent and highly attuned to the nonsense (e.g. Charlotte's husband's self-absorption, the inanity spewed by the actress Kelly, the artiness of the crew directing the commercial) that surrounds them. High above the Tokyo streets, both protagonists are trapped in their luxurious but cold setting and the two forge an ambiguous, tender bond. It is to Coppola's credit that the bond remains ambiguous to the end (what did they say to one another in the final scene?) and that the movie avoids the traps that could so easily have ensued had the two had allowed the obvious attraction between them to become explicitly sexual. Coppola allows Bob and Charlotte's story to unfold in its own messy,goofy, unclassifiable way. The scenes involving the filming of the whiskey commercial are hysterical. The scene where Murray sings ""More than this"" at the Karaoke bar perfectly captures the film's spirit: unpolished, ambiguous, heartfelt and ironic.",5,"dreamy, atmospheric, ambiguous, cinematic, thoughtful.

619596,A27Q9NX3M3GN63,B00005JMJ4,"madamemusico ""madamemusico""","[6, 14]","I think that what really bothered me about this film was not whether or not it was &quot;exciting&quot; vs. &quot;real,&quot; which seems to be most of the arguments below, but the fact that the Murray-Johansson &quot;friendship&quot; didn't really bloom at all.  The only thing they had in common was being bored and lonely, he because his family (from which he is, apparently, becoming more estranged day by day) is halfway across the world from him, she because her husband is not merely (as the box describes him) a workaholic but the fact that she has practically nothing in common with him.But herein lies a crux.  Murray and Johansson have nothing in common at all besides their loneliness.  As another reviewer put it, they &quot;have a mediocre time.&quot;  The nicest scene in the entire film was when they lay in bed just talking to each other...if there had been more of that, or if it had developed from there, it might have picked up a bit.And then there is the interesting fact that neither of them ever even mentions their new &quot;friend&quot; to their respective spouses when talking to them...as if this friendship is so clandestine that no one is supposed to know about it.  At several points in the film, I kept hoping that the pair would be accidentally walked in on by her husband just to liven things up...pretty sad (not to mention predictable), but that's how bored I became by it all.The only halfway interesting scene was when Murray's character goes to bed with the lounge singer.  You can tell it wasn't for love but for loneliness and, more interestingly, you get the impression that it was a sort of transference of his feelings for Johansson who he really wanted but dared not touch.  That, at least, was both real and profoundly human.  But otherwise, this film is all artsy style and a glimpse of Japanese culture through the eyes of a (bored) stranger, not much more...about a 75-minute film stretched out to an hour and 45 minutes.  You will, of course, be the ultimate judge, but all I can say is, if she were me I'd want Murray's character to take me to an art museum, a symphony concert, or just sit and talk things out more than they did.

619597,A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B00005JMJ4,"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny""","[8, 12]","Continuing to be entrenched in an existentialist stronghold, Sofia Coppola presents us with a great script coupled with impeccable acting by Bill Murray, splendid photography and an enviable soundtrack to go with it all: a perfect combination, if you ask me!The story deservedly earned Ms. Coppola (who was also the first American woman ever nominated for the Academy Award as a Director) an Oscar for best original script in 2004. The story takes place in Tokyo, a strange culture that results almost extraterrestrial at first to the legendary actor Bob Harris (played by Murray), now reduced to touring exotic locations and venues and doing luxury drink commercials, and young and beautiful Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johansson). Both are stranded in this faraway land: he (over 50), being away from his family in the US, and undergoing a middle age crisis; and she (just over 20, fresh out of school and not being married for too long), also &quot;distant&quot; (yet physically close) from her husband who she's accompanying in Tokyo on a business trip, while she tries to figure out what to make of her life, after four years of Philosophy in college. The two, in the midst of their own particular crises, connect and a unique chemistry builds up between them that will capture you and leave you thinking, regardless of which of their ages you're closer to.Murray's acting, with a very subtle sense of humor, takes the story to a level that not many other actors could, balancing his internal conflicts with the ability to laugh at himself and life at large, when things don't turn out as he'd like them to. A hilarious moment for history in this movie is his struggle when dealing with his wife's suggestion that they pick burgundy for the color of a new carpet back home, while in front of a whole group of red-looking samples, not having a clue which one she means as THE burgundy sample. Impossible not to crack up, since most men will not be able to tell tones of red appart from each other (and even if we did, most of the time we don't really care what color things are, anyway).Photography and music bring an added art element to the movie that is impossible to overlook. The lights and visual elements in Tokyo help capture some breathtaking moments that transport the user to places remote for most of us, in a very surreal way. The music helps build atmospheres in ways that approach perfection: it's a great continuation of the effect Ms. Coppola accomplished in Virgin Suicides, a movie that French duo Air masterfully scored. In 'Lost in Translation', Air participates once again, this time alongside Kevin Shields (My Bloddy Valentine), Death in Vegas, Jesus &amp; Mary Chain and a handful of others to assemble a powerful and eclectic soundtrack that provides an unforgettable musical frame to the rest of the art of the movie.Without a doubt, among the best movies of 2003.",5,Great follow-up to Virgin Suicides: among the best of 2003,1079049600,"03 12, 2004",2004,2897,"['Continuing', 'be', 'entrenched', 'existentialist', 'stronghold', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'great', 'script', 'coupled', 'impeccable', 'acting', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'splendid', 'photography', 'enviable', 'soundtrack', 'go', 'perfect', 'combination', 'ask', 'story', 'deservedly', 'earned', 'Ms.', 'Coppola', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'American', 'woman', 'ever', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'best', 'original', 'script', '2004', 'story', 'place', 'Tokyo', 'strange', 'culture', 'results', 'almost', 'extraterrestrial', 'first', 'legendary', 'actor', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'played', 'Murray', 'now', 'reduced', 'touring', 'exotic', 'locations', 'venues', 'doing', 'luxury', 'drink', 'commercials', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Charlotte', 'played', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'are', 'stranded', 'faraway', 'land', '50', 'being', 'away', 'family', 'US', 'undergoing', 'middle', 'age', 'crisis', 'just', '20', 'fresh', 'school', 'not', 'being', 'married', 'too', 'long', 'also', 'quot', 'distant', 'quot', 'yet', 'physically', 'close', 'husband', 'who', 'accompanying', 'Tokyo', 'business', 'trip', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'make', 'life', 'four', 'years', 'Philosophy', 'college', 'two', 'midst', 'own', 'particular', 'crises', 'connect', 'unique', 'chemistry', 'up', 'will', 'capture', 'leave', 'thinking', 'regardless', 'ages', ""'re"", 'closer', 'to.Murray', 'acting', 'very', 'subtle', 'sense', 'humor', 'story', 'level', 'not', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'could', 'balancing', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'ability', 'laugh', 'life', 'large', 'when', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', ""'d"", 'like', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'history', 'movie', 'struggle', 'when', 'dealing', 'wife', 'suggestion', 'pick', 'burgundy', 'color', 'new', 'carpet', 'back', 'home', 'front', 'whole', 'group', 'red-looking', 'samples', 'not', 'having', 'clue', 'one', 'THE', 'burgundy', 'sample', 'Impossible', 'not', 'crack', 'up', 'most', 'men', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'tones', 'red', 'appart', 'other', 'even', 'did', 'most', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'color', 'things', 'are', 'anyway', '.Photography', 'music', 'bring', 'added', 'art', 'element', 'movie', 'impossible', 'overlook', 'lights', 'visual', 'elements', 'Tokyo', 'help', 'capture', 'breathtaking', 'moments', 'transport', 'user', 'places', 'remote', 'most', 'very', 'surreal', 'way', 'music', 'build', 'atmospheres', 'ways', 'approach', 'perfection', 'great', 'continuation', 'effect', 'Ms.', 'Coppola', 'accomplished', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'movie', 'French', 'duo', 'Air', 'masterfully', 'scored', ""'Lost"", 'Translation', 'Air', 'once', 'again', 'time', 'alongside', 'Kevin', 'Shields', 'My', 'Bloddy', 'Valentine', 'Death', 'Vegas', 'Jesus', 'amp', 'Mary', 'Chain', 'handful', 'others', 'assemble', 'powerful', 'eclectic', 'soundtrack', 'unforgettable', 'musical', 'frame', 'rest', 'art', 'movie.Without', 'doubt', 'best', 'movies', '2003']",Lost in Translation
619598,A1D2AXVN20OQZD,B00005JMJ4,Marc A. Coignard,"[8, 14]","...and that's what I think I liked best about it.  Some complain that there is no plot and no jokes, yet wonder why so many of us like it enough to give it 5-stars (or offer it so many Academy Awards). The truth is what makes this movie such a gem is that it doesn't need to come out and smack you in the head with the type of dull, predicatable nonesense like most movies do these days.  It reminds me of older films; not in content or style, necessarily, but in its honest simplicity.  Why is it funny?  Not because its a constant joke machine, but because its just the opposite.  Does someone need to fall down, curse, get hurt, or otherwise make a fool out of themselves in order to be funny?  Well, to most people yes.  The reason why this movie is so funny is the same reason certain scenes in Casablanca are so funny, despite the seriousness of that film's subject: dialogue.  Because I haven't watched the movie lately, I'll leave it at that, and asure most of you that if you just relax and don't expect to see slapstick or stupid voices or people acting foolish, you might actually enjoy a movie that is funny in its simplicity.Another thing worth mentioning is Bill Murray's performance.  Many people, including critics who enjoyed the film, thought that Murray's Oscar nomination was unwarrented; that he was simply ""being"" Bill Murry.  That's like saying (to use the Casablanca reference again) that Bogey was just being himself and didn't have to act to be Rick Blaine.  I strongly disagree.  Murray's performance isn't in your face like most of his, or other actor's , performances.  True, he doesn't really have to ""become"" anyone, but he still has to act.  He has to be convincingly lonely, upset, tired, and frustrated, all the while being funny.  He doesn't just do it, it does it better than most actors could.  I'd hate to see Sean Penn try that, or even Jaime Fox a great actor, but when he does ""funny"" he can only seem to do a certain kind of in-your-face funny...that's not what this movie needed, and thank God thats not what it tried to do.Finally, the script.  Like its humor, its simply good, and charming.  All it asks of us is to give up two hours to watch to lonely Americans who find themselves in the same place, waiting for things to happen.  In the end, they become great friends and they decide to go out and make things happen. It doesn't need a caper of any kind. It doens't need explosions or any kind of love affair.  This is a character driven Comedic-Drama (or Dramatic-Comedy) and the chemistry between the Murray and Johansen is perfect.  I can't wait to see this movie again.",5,This Film is Simply Good,1110412800,"03 10, 2005",2005,2621,"['what', 'think', 'liked', 'best', 'complain', 'plot', 'jokes', 'yet', 'wonder', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'enough', 'give', '5-stars', 'offer', 'so', 'many', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'truth', 'what', 'movie', 'gem', ""n't"", 'need', 'come', 'out', 'smack', 'head', 'type', 'dull', 'predicatable', 'nonesense', 'most', 'movies', 'do', 'days', 'older', 'films', 'not', 'content', 'style', 'necessarily', 'honest', 'simplicity', 'Why', 'funny', 'Not', 'constant', 'joke', 'machine', 'just', 'opposite', 'Does', 'someone', 'need', 'fall', 'down', 'curse', 'get', 'hurt', 'otherwise', 'make', 'fool', 'order', 'be', 'funny', 'Well', 'most', 'people', 'yes', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'funny', 'same', 'reason', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Casablanca', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'seriousness', 'film', 'subject', 'dialogue', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'movie', 'lately', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'asure', 'most', 'just', 'relax', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'slapstick', 'stupid', 'voices', 'people', 'acting', 'foolish', 'might', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'funny', 'simplicity.Another', 'thing', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'performance', 'Many', 'people', 'including', 'critics', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'thought', 'Murray', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'was', 'unwarrented', 'was', 'simply', 'being', 'Bill', 'Murry', 'saying', 'use', 'Casablanca', 'reference', 'again', 'Bogey', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'act', 'be', 'Rick', 'Blaine', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'Murray', 'performance', ""n't"", 'face', 'most', 'other', 'actor', 'performances', 'True', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'become', 'anyone', 'still', 'act', 'be', 'convincingly', 'lonely', 'upset', 'tired', 'frustrated', 'while', 'being', 'funny', ""n't"", 'just', 'do', 'better', 'most', 'actors', 'could', ""'d"", 'hate', 'see', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'try', 'even', 'Jaime', 'Fox', 'great', 'actor', 'when', 'funny', 'can', 'only', 'seem', 'do', 'certain', 'kind', 'in-your-face', 'funny', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'needed', 'thank', 'God', 'not', 'what', 'tried', 'do.Finally', 'script', 'humor', 'simply', 'good', 'charming', 'give', 'up', 'two', 'hours', 'watch', 'lonely', 'Americans', 'who', 'find', 'same', 'place', 'waiting', 'things', 'happen', 'end', 'become', 'great', 'friends', 'decide', 'go', 'out', 'make', 'things', 'happen', ""n't"", 'need', 'caper', 'kind', ""doens't"", 'need', 'explosions', 'kind', 'love', 'affair', 'character', 'driven', 'Comedic-Drama', 'Dramatic-Comedy', 'chemistry', 'Murray', 'Johansen', 'perfect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'movie', 'again']",Lost in Translation

If so, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is for you.I rarely ever write negative reviews but I couldn't resist doing so for this one since I can honestly say that I have not been disappointed in a movie in a very long time as I have been with this film.With all the hype and hoopla surrounding this film, I was expecting to see something decent and entertaining when I finally got around to renting it.  Thank goodness I only rented it. I pity those who actually bought the dvd and found out what a bore it really is.I saw this film around Oscar time and actually got to watch 4 of the 5 nominated Best Picture films.  Of the 4, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; was by far the best and most brilliant, followed by &quot;Master &amp; Commander,&quot; then &quot;Seabiscuit.&quot;  I could barely sit through &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot;  I talked to a handful of other people who have seen this and we all said the same thing: &quot;what a piece of overrated mush&quot; (except some of them were less kind than I was).  It truly is a film that goes nowhere.  Scarlett Johansson's character spends half the movie looking out the window in her Tokyo hotel smoking a cigarette. Bill Murray is either lying on his bed in the same Tokyo hotel or sitting in the bar and drinking himself silly.  They meet, hang out a few times then Bill Murray goes home.  That's about it.  Goodness knows Sofia Coppola wouldn't have won that Best Original Screenplay Oscar if not for her family name and Hollywood connections.  Her work with &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; was much better.If you want a great Bill Murray movie, rent or buy &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; or &quot;Rushmore&quot; instead.  These films are entertaining and feature Bill Murray at his best.  And anyone, I mean 'anyone,' could have played Scarlett Johansson's role.  There was barely any acting involved there.  Though I am not a big fan of &quot;Cold Mountain,&quot; I think that film deserved the 5th spot for Best Picture much more than this movie.

There were flashes of greatness (Bill Murray's wife Fed-Exing decorating decisions, the whole has-been actor scenes, etc.) and the feeling of isolation was beautifully done (the young wife feeling alone even when with her husband, phone conversations were compelling, and so on) but it's just like that story you and your friends tell and laugh hysterically about but either you REALLY had to be there to find it funny or you have to be ______(drunk, sleep deprived or you fill in the blank here) to understand.

I was about to switch channels when I decided for whatever reason to give it a couple of more minutes.Those couple of minutes rapidly turned into the entire movie and I can't recall when I have seen a movie - without action or drama or special effects - that I enjoyed so much as Lost In Translation.Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation is a wonderful story about the very special bond that develops between two very different people who happen to be in Tokyo.Bill Murray gives a stand out performance and maybe the best of his career as an aging American movie star who is in Tokyo - instead of doing a meaningful play somewhere else - to film a television commercial, which will pay him $2.0 million.Scarlett Johanssen is a young married woman - she was 18 or 19 playing a woman in her early 20's - who has accompanied her photographer husband -Giovanni Ribisi - to Tokyo. He's there to film a music video and Scarlett, because her husband is busy working, is essentially left to her own devices to pass the time.Lost In Translation tells the story of the meeting and relationship, which develops between these two very different people. However, it is told in such an honest and life-like way that we forget we're actually watching a movie. What we see on the screen developing between these too characters is very special and the viewer comes to know and like these characters. In fact, you almost wish this movie wouldn't end.I had heard the ""hype"" about Scarlett Johanssen - the ""It"" girl and perhaps that factor alone is what initially put me off about this movie. Normally, I am very skeptical about this type of label and rarely does the individual actually live up to the expectations the media creates.However, in this instance, every wonderful accolade that is bestowed upon her is well deserved. She is enchanting as this neglected wife who is a recent graduate in philosphy (""alot of dough in that racket"" as Bill wonderfully remarks to her..!). Her expressive eyes and wonderful and spontaneous laugh are so real and so evocative that it's impossible not to be drawn to her character. I find that she is able to convey more feeling with just a look or smile than most actresses can with an encyclopedia of script.And you can't say enough good things about Bill Murray, who plays this world-weary and throughly likeable middle aged man who's been married for a quarter of a century to a woman. Throughout the movie, Bill will call his wife and you get a real sense that the passion and excitement of his marriage has long disappeared. His telephone conversations with his wife are very short and she seems to have very little interest in her husband's stay in Tokyo. it's no wonder that he finds himself drawn to this kindred spirit - Scarlett - who is half his age.I'm pleased that Sofia didn't succumb to the cliche to develop a sexual relationship between these two. There was, of course, real affection and trust between them, however, you sense that their relationship is far too special to sacrifice it for a ""roll in the hay"".Since that intial viewing, I have seen this movie several times on my cable movie network and I find myself drawn to it like a moth to the flame.This is a very rare and special movie and after having seen it, I now understand why this movie was almost universally hailed as a tour-de-force by the critics.For anybody interested in human behaviour and interaction - which should be us all, it should be mandatory viewing.A very special film and one that I would not hsitate to recommend / buy.",5,This Is A Great Movie - But Not For All..,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,3900,"['inexplicable', 'reason', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'theaters', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'desire', 'see', 'decided', 'pass', 'it.When', 'was', 'eventually', 'released', 'DVD', 'still', 'passed', 'whenever', 'saw', 'available', 'copy', 'new', 'releases', 'section.The', 'other', 'night', 'flipping', 'channels', 'came', 'one', 'movie', 'channels', 'get', 'cable', 'was', 'about', 'switch', 'channels', 'when', 'decided', 'reason', 'give', 'couple', 'more', 'minutes.Those', 'couple', 'minutes', 'rapidly', 'turned', 'entire', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'when', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'action', 'drama', 'special', 'effects', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'Lost', 'Translation.Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'wonderful', 'story', 'very', 'special', 'bond', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'Tokyo.Bill', 'Murray', 'stand', 'out', 'performance', 'maybe', 'best', 'career', 'aging', 'American', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'Tokyo', 'instead', 'doing', 'meaningful', 'play', 'somewhere', 'else', 'film', 'television', 'commercial', 'will', 'pay', '2.0', 'million.Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'young', 'married', 'woman', 'was', '18', '19', 'playing', 'woman', 'early', '20', 'who', 'accompanied', 'photographer', 'husband', '-Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Tokyo', 'there', 'film', 'music', 'video', 'Scarlett', 'husband', 'busy', 'working', 'essentially', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'pass', 'time.Lost', 'Translation', 'story', 'meeting', 'relationship', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'However', 'told', 'such', 'honest', 'life-like', 'way', 'forget', ""'re"", 'actually', 'watching', 'movie', 'What', 'see', 'screen', 'developing', 'too', 'characters', 'very', 'special', 'viewer', 'know', 'characters', 'fact', 'almost', 'wish', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'end.I', 'had', 'heard', 'hype', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'girl', 'perhaps', 'factor', 'alone', 'what', 'initially', 'put', 'off', 'movie', 'Normally', 'am', 'very', 'skeptical', 'type', 'label', 'rarely', 'individual', 'actually', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'media', 'creates.However', 'instance', 'wonderful', 'accolade', 'bestowed', 'well', 'deserved', 'enchanting', 'neglected', 'wife', 'who', 'recent', 'graduate', 'philosphy', 'alot', 'dough', 'racket', 'Bill', 'wonderfully', 'remarks', 'her..', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'wonderful', 'spontaneous', 'laugh', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'evocative', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'drawn', 'character', 'find', 'able', 'convey', 'more', 'feeling', 'just', 'look', 'smile', 'most', 'actresses', 'can', 'encyclopedia', 'script.And', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'who', 'world-weary', 'throughly', 'likeable', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'quarter', 'century', 'woman', 'movie', 'Bill', 'will', 'call', 'wife', 'get', 'real', 'sense', 'passion', 'excitement', 'marriage', 'long', 'disappeared', 'telephone', 'conversations', 'wife', 'are', 'very', 'short', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'interest', 'husband', 'stay', 'Tokyo', 'wonder', 'drawn', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'Scarlett', 'who', 'age.I', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'Sofia', 'did', ""n't"", 'succumb', 'cliche', 'develop', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'two', 'was', 'course', 'real', 'affection', 'trust', 'however', 'sense', 'relationship', 'far', 'too', 'special', 'sacrifice', 'roll', 'hay', '.Since', 'intial', 'viewing', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'cable', 'movie', 'network', 'find', 'drawn', 'moth', 'flame.This', 'very', 'rare', 'special', 'movie', 'having', 'seen', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'universally', 'hailed', 'tour-de-force', 'critics.For', 'anybody', 'interested', 'human', 'behaviour', 'interaction', 'should', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'mandatory', 'viewing.A', 'very', 'special', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'hsitate', 'recommend', '/', 'buy']",Lost in Translation

Bill Murray knew he was saying alot more than that and the translator was more than abbreviating the conversation.My view of the movie was imagine video-taping your grandpa sitting on the front porch napping.  That was as exciting as I found the plot. Now reading the reviews I can only guess that if you actually visited Tokyo you would be able to relate to this type of boredom.

619605,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00005JMJ4,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[2, 6]","Lost in Translation is a great mix of Hollywood comedy and independent drama. It works because of Bill Murray's terrific comedic performance, and Scarlett Johansonn's role as suffering wife to Giovanni Ribisi (who has yet to give a bad performance). The film can get tedious at times, especially during a second viewing, but it all depends on taste. I am amazed at some of the bad reviews for this though, because it is well-made and funny, albeit not hilarious.Lost in Translation is a sometimes funny, often poignant, and always sensitive look at the importance of being human and finding yourself. It is definitely different from most films and those looking for a typical Bill Murray comedy should look elsewhere. This is a touching and beautiful portrait of a romance that could never be, with real characters, not cardboard cut-outs. Perhaps that's what turns most people off, because God forbid they see some of themselves in a film character. I loved this film, my date admired it and was 'wowed.'

I loved the scenery and the small glimpses into everyday Japanese life, all meshed together with this love story of two people brought together by loneliness and uncertainty, with a musical soundtrack that brings out the best in all of it.After watching this film, the first thing that sprang to my mind was that I'm so glad I don't rely on Amazon reviewers to make a decision about whether I am going to see a film or not. That's almost as dumb as asking a fifteen year old to sit through it and not go crazy or pass out. This film is too mature, dealing with grown-up questions, situations and problems that the kiddies here have yet to grasp.Bill Murray's character is going through a midlife crisis; Scarlet Johansen's is tormented that she cannot seem to discover her purpose in life. Both are trapped in a place where they know no one, and understand nothing. They gravitate to one another and fall into a kind of love that is very unique, but also not at all uncommon under the circumstances. They don't pursue it physically, because they live in a real world with real consequences and have to respect the promises they made to people they both still love.No kid fresh out of tenth grade will ever be able to comprehend these emotions... no wonder most of these reviews are from people who were bored stiff. ""No sex? No violence? This movie SUCKS"", seems to be the way it works with these Amazon reviews.Too bad. Maybe when they all grow up they'll get it.

Harris is working on a whiskey commercial, seemingly estranged from his wife in the States. Charlotte's photographer husband leaves her alone while out doing photo shoots. Eventually the two meet and slowly become friends. There's not a great deal of dialogue, but what is said is true and from the heart. This is definitely not a `plot-driven' story. The visuals are interesting, but not unique and filmed nearly like a travelogue. There could have been more attention given to the editing, which at times seems choppy and inappropriately mixed. However, the sound is crisp and cleverly portrays the modern soul of Tokyo. This is an experience that needs to be taken in slowly to appreciate the moods and emotions that are almost too subtle. It is not a far stretch to imagine that Director Sofia Coppola probably took most of these dialogues form her own conversations with her father Francis. The relationship between Bob and Charlotte is part soul mate and part paternal. There is no sexual tension between the two and that makes this film separate from most Hollywood fare. Some of the episodes with Bob and the Japanese people were on the edge of condescension, with more than enough confusion on how the Japanese cannot speak proper English. It was overly used and an inappropriate motif. However, that's not enough to override the atmosphere of the film.

619608,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005JMJ4,Martin Asiner,"[3, 3]","Whenever Hollywood shows two unrelated people in mind numbing solitude, it has a tendency to connect them against all odds.  In LOST IN TRANSLATION, director Sofia Coppola tries for something daringly different.  She has 50ish film star Bob (Bill Murray) shooting a very lucrative whiskey commercial in Tokyo.  He is separated from his wife and children by far more than the nearest telephone.  In Japan, he is lost both culturally and emotionally.  Then there is a very young Charlotte (Scarlett Johannson), who has been unhappily married for two years to a photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) who seems determined to avoid her as much as Bob's wife seems determined to avoid him. Director Coppola could easily have romantically cleaved the two, the way Richard Gere did to Wynona Rider in AUTUMN IN NEW YORK. Instead, she allows them to bond in ways that show their physical and emotional needs without having to follow through on them.  When Bob carries an exhausted Charlotte into her bedroom and places her on the bed, he tucks her in with the sweet caring of a long lost father.  Given the way Coppola had presented them, I expected no less.LOST IN TRANSLATION is not a plot driven film. It is a random walk through a neon Tokyo that is full of one dimensional stereotypes of Japanese who are eternally bowing and apologizing.  Still, this is not a flaw of the director.  To one who is truly lost in translation, a Tokyo full of babbling non-English speaking residents is exactly how that city would have seemed.  When Bob and Charlotte acknowledge their surprisingly strong ties at the film's end, the audience can see that to be alone does not mean that one has to end it or even redirect it.  Sometimes, one is satisfied with only coming to grips with it.

619610,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00005JMJ4,Matthew Gladney,"[997, 1119]","Bill Murray is Bob Harris, a once popular American actor who now, in his middle-age, has found more acceptance and money from the people of Japan than from his own country. He arrives at a prestigious hotel in Tokyo and is given a royal treatment by his greeters and hosts. He is by himself in the land of the rising sun, his wife and kids having stayed behing in the US while he travels across the globe to do some liquor commercials. This Tokyo excursion will take about a week, and the monetary reward will be quite handsome. Contrast this with Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who is at the same hotel tagging along with her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), as he does a multiple-day photo shoot. John is at work most of the time, and so Charlotte is by herself at the hotel, her attempts to keep from being bored proving fruitless. Both Bob and Charlotte are married people, but they are also very lonely people, and that is what ""Lost In Translation"" is all about.Bob and Charlotte catch glimpses of one another at different places in the hotel, and finally decide to converse in earnest at the hotel bar. The entire plot of the film is about these two people getting to know each other. The story revolves around them. In fact, the story *is* them. Bob, in his early-fifties, is old enough to be Charlotte's dad, but that doesn't matter here. It's not about age. It's about the place, and the points that each of these people are at in their lives. Bob loves his children very much, but we do not sense he feels the same for his wife. We hear her on the phone when she calls him, and the same weary sentiment seems to flow from her voice. They are becoming a couple in name only. Then there's Charlotte & John. Both are young, and both are self-possessed. John is into his photography to the point of neglecting Charlotte. But we get the idea that even if gave her more attention, Charlotte might not really warm up to him. She has issues of her own. If Bob is going through a mid-life crisis, then Charlotte seems to be going through a young-life crisis.""Lost In Translation"" is about being alone. Loneliness doesn't always mean that someone is physically separated from loved ones or from people in general. One can be alone in the middle of a crowded room. Such is the case with Bob & Charlotte. They're in Japan for a week. They don't really speak the language. Bob's wife is in the US, and Charlotte's husband is always at a photo shoot. The two lost souls find each other at the hotel, spend time with one another, and even sleep in the same bed together. But we know that while this is providing a small comfort for the time being, it is not a lasting solution to their problems. And we also understand that both Bob and Charlotte -- even if Bob's wife were in Tokyo with him, and John was by Charlotte's side all the time -- would still be lonely. Their life struggles lie deeper than what one person can provide, especially the persons they have chosen to settle down with.This is probably Bill Murray's most understated performance, and it works brilliantly. He lets you in on Bob's emotions without betraying too much sentimentality. He conveys so much with just a smile, a frown, his body language, or simply the look in his eyes. He should get an Oscar nomination for this. Scarlett Johansson, who left me unimpressed in the movie ""Ghost World"" a few years ago, is excellent in her role here. She portrays Charlotte as a deep, troubled, yet intelligent young woman and, like her co-star, does it without overstating it. She spends much of her screen time walking around a hotel room in her pink panties, and does it so simply and matter-of-factly that it becomes both vulnerable and sexy at the same time. Johansson is definitely an actress to watch for in the coming years.Sofia Coppola has succeeded in creating a sliver of time & place with ""Lost In Translation"". It creates two of the most realistic characters to ever grace the cinema. You forget this is a movie, and start to really care for these people as though they really exist. And you get the feeling that this is a single, solitary moment that will be over with and then fondly remembered by the characters for a long time to come. This sweeps over you before the film is even over, much like when you are in the middle of a special occurence or event in your own life, and you stop and think about the fact that at one point - very soon - it will cease to be the present, and will instead become only a nostalgic memory.And there you have ""Lost In Translation""",5,"Lonely Days, Lonely Nights",1068681600,"11 13, 2003",2003,4557,"['Bill', 'Murray', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'once', 'popular', 'American', 'actor', 'who', 'now', 'middle-age', 'found', 'more', 'acceptance', 'money', 'people', 'Japan', 'own', 'country', 'prestigious', 'hotel', 'Tokyo', 'given', 'royal', 'treatment', 'greeters', 'hosts', 'land', 'rising', 'sun', 'wife', 'kids', 'having', 'stayed', 'behing', 'US', 'globe', 'do', 'liquor', 'commercials', 'Tokyo', 'excursion', 'will', 'take', 'week', 'monetary', 'reward', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'handsome', 'Contrast', 'Charlotte', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'same', 'hotel', 'tagging', 'along', 'photographer', 'husband', 'John', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'multiple-day', 'photo', 'shoot', 'John', 'work', 'most', 'time', 'so', 'Charlotte', 'hotel', 'attempts', 'keep', 'being', 'bored', 'proving', 'fruitless', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'married', 'people', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'lonely', 'people', 'what', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'about.Bob', 'Charlotte', 'catch', 'glimpses', 'one', 'different', 'places', 'hotel', 'finally', 'decide', 'converse', 'earnest', 'hotel', 'bar', 'entire', 'plot', 'film', 'two', 'people', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'story', 'fact', 'story', '*is*', 'Bob', 'early-fifties', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'Charlotte', 'dad', ""n't"", 'matter', 'here', 'not', 'about', 'age', 'place', 'points', 'people', 'are', 'lives', 'Bob', 'children', 'very', 'much', 'do', 'not', 'sense', 'same', 'wife', 'hear', 'phone', 'when', 'same', 'weary', 'sentiment', 'flow', 'voice', 'are', 'becoming', 'couple', 'name', 'only', 'Then', 'Charlotte', 'John', 'are', 'young', 'are', 'self-possessed', 'John', 'photography', 'point', 'neglecting', 'Charlotte', 'get', 'idea', 'even', 'gave', 'more', 'attention', 'Charlotte', 'might', 'not', 'really', 'warm', 'up', 'issues', 'own', 'Bob', 'going', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'then', 'Charlotte', 'be', 'going', 'young-life', 'crisis', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'being', 'alone', 'Loneliness', ""n't"", 'always', 'mean', 'someone', 'physically', 'separated', 'loved', 'ones', 'people', 'general', 'One', 'can', 'be', 'alone', 'middle', 'crowded', 'room', 'Such', 'case', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', ""'re"", 'Japan', 'week', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'speak', 'language', 'Bob', 'wife', 'US', 'Charlotte', 'husband', 'always', 'photo', 'shoot', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'find', 'other', 'hotel', 'spend', 'time', 'one', 'even', 'sleep', 'same', 'bed', 'together', 'know', 'providing', 'small', 'comfort', 'time', 'being', 'not', 'lasting', 'solution', 'problems', 'also', 'understand', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'even', 'Bob', 'wife', 'were', 'Tokyo', 'John', 'was', 'Charlotte', 'side', 'time', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'lonely', 'life', 'deeper', 'what', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'provide', 'especially', 'persons', 'have', 'chosen', 'settle', 'down', 'with.This', 'probably', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'most', 'understated', 'performance', 'brilliantly', 'Bob', 'emotions', 'betraying', 'too', 'much', 'sentimentality', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'smile', 'frown', 'body', 'language', 'simply', 'look', 'eyes', 'should', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'left', 'unimpressed', 'movie', 'Ghost', 'World', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'excellent', 'role', 'here', 'Charlotte', 'deep', 'troubled', 'yet', 'intelligent', 'young', 'woman', 'co-star', 'overstating', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'walking', 'around', 'hotel', 'room', 'pink', 'panties', 'so', 'simply', 'matter-of-factly', 'vulnerable', 'sexy', 'same', 'time', 'Johansson', 'definitely', 'actress', 'watch', 'coming', 'years.Sofia', 'Coppola', 'succeeded', 'creating', 'sliver', 'time', 'place', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'two', 'most', 'realistic', 'characters', 'ever', 'grace', 'cinema', 'forget', 'movie', 'start', 'really', 'care', 'people', 'really', 'exist', 'get', 'feeling', 'single', 'solitary', 'moment', 'will', 'be', 'then', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'characters', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'film', 'even', 'much', 'when', 'are', 'middle', 'special', 'occurence', 'event', 'own', 'life', 'stop', 'think', 'fact', 'one', 'point', 'very', 'soon', 'will', 'cease', 'be', 'present', 'will', 'instead', 'become', 'only', 'nostalgic', 'memory.And', 'there', 'have', 'Lost', 'Translation']",Lost in Translation

It is the kind of movie whose hierarchy in cinema history will be decided years from now. One thing that it is not is `mainstream'. Some viewers will be spellbound by it. Others will come away wondering why they wasted their time.Part of the `problem' is that the story is like a minimalist painting - the viewer must fill in much of the details. A famous Hollywood star, Bob Harris [Bill Murray], travels to Tokyo to do some commercials for a Japanese whiskey manufacturer. All those time zones he has traveled through give him insomnia. Already ensconced at Bob's posh hotel is a young woman, Charlotte [Scarlett Johansson], who has traveled there with her husband [Giovanni Ribisi], a famous photographer. The husband must travel around Japan on assignment, leaving Charlotte on her own in Tokyo. Bob and Charlotte meet and have an affair which is far more spiritual than physical. When Bob's time in Japan is up, they both move on.There is no raging sexual affair here. There is no moaning about how `bad' Bob and Charlotte's spouses are. [Bob's wife is back in California.] Both will return to the lives they have been living, albeit positively changed.

619614,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B00005JMJ4,M. Burns,"[90, 101]","I saw Translation for the first time and liked it, but didn't really know what they saw in the movie that was so beyond-belief spectacular. But alas, I believe that every movie deserves a second chance, so recently I sat down and experienced director Sophia Coppola's Lost In Translation again.Lost in Translation tells the story of Bob Harris (Bill Murray in a role tailor-made, if not even Heaven-sent for him), an American movie star that comes to Tokyo to film a whiskey commerical for which he will be paid 2 million bucks. Staying in the same Tokyo hotel is Charlotte (Scarlett Johanssen, radiant and mature at only 18), a newlywed tagging along with her rock photographer husband, John (a typically awkward Giovanni Ribisi). Along the way, Charlotte and Bob run into each other and begin a 'brief encounter' that profoundly affects them both.When the movie hits you right, it's a pure pleasure from its unassuming start (a beautifully lit shot up Johanssen's underwear-clothed behind) to its ambiguous but meaningful ending. It begins as a comedy of culture clash, Harris sarcastic and confused at the Japanese when entering his hotel, and even more befuddled in a hilarious scene where he shoots the whiskey commercial. Coppola delivers Bob into her movie with the impression that it'll be all about him, but Charlotte enters the story, and we're never quite the same. Scarlett Johanssen plays Charlotte with just the right amount of emotion that her initially morose and soul-searching character doesn't seem silly. At one point, she tearfully admits over the phone, ""I don't know who I married."" Bob, on the other hand, seems to have it made, but Murray lets a current of loneliness run across that memorable face. He gets comical faxes from his wife about bookshelves and carpet samples, but he gives off the impression that he's come to the point where he doesn't even care anymore. Bob is certainly alone for a time in Tokyo, but Murray alludes that things at home aren't too hot either.For the first third of the movie, director Coppola displays her first brave choice in filmmaking by keeping Bob and Charlotte apart. Upon my first viewing of Translation, I wasn't convinced of Coppola's choice to keep the movie so predominantly low-key, but I've realized that there's a reason for it. The movie sustains this amazing vibe that doesn't stunt its progress, but propels it with a driving fluidity. A few times, though, Bob and Charlotte do see each other without officially meeting. One time in particular occurs in a crowded elevator - the two glance at each other, faintly smile, and possibility is born. The first section of the film doesn't just serve to show its two characters completely apart - it makes you think of how many life-changing connections you've missed in the past by just being passive and solitary.The two meet and begin voyages out into the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, and the film takes on a perspective that differs from its earlier view. Before, we saw Bob Harris and Charlotte, respectively, at their most private and vulnerable. While out on the town, the film seems to sit back and just let them have fun. Thank God, for Bill Murray's rousing rendition of Elvis Costello's ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding"" is a blast. During this time, it seems that Bob and Charlotte have forgotten their insomnia and loneliness, but it's not gone forever. Even during their night on the town, we see moments where they sit silently, pensive and confused. The movie is a comedy in some sense, but it escalates into a pervading tragic feel. At one point, Charlotte says to Bob: ""Let's never come back here again, because it will never be as much fun."" They had fun, but only in the sense of putting off more loneliness.It takes a while, but the motivations of each character become fully-realized in a marvelous scene where Bob and Charlottelay fully-clothed in bed together. Here, they handle the 'big' questions in life, and not ""Where did you go to college?"" or ""What did you want to be when you were little?"" but ""What is my purpose?"" and ""Does marraige get easier?"" I was amazed at the honesty of the character's responses. Bob relates to Charlotte the experience of having children and the ongoing struggles of marraige, but a tinge of fear and apprehension runs through his speech. Charlotte hasn't really figured things out for herself yet - she says she's tried just about everything but hasn't found that niche. Coppola's screenplay makes the statement that both are in the same exact emotional limbo. Charlotte is confused and worried, but Bob is regretful and washed-up. In a way, these two are some form of deeply odd soul-mates. That is the heart and soul of Coppola's amazing work.Translation has great comedic flair with Murray's wonderful work, but it's also perhaps one of the saddest and most moving films I've seen in a long time. It's some form of a romance, too, but it's not about when they'll kiss or when they'll hit the sheets. It also has that Affair to Remember vibe too, where the journey of two souls that find comfort will eventually have to come to an end. Its end, though, defies classification, as does the rest of the film. Coppola simply lets her two amazing leads do the work. When the film does arrive at its final, ambiguous moment, it all just seems perfect. The catchy Japan-pop soundtrack that runs brilliantly throughout the film begins to play, and I find myself with a huge regret: that I won't be able to savor the subtle chemistry of Bob and Charlotte, and that a flat-out masterpiece in American film is at its end.",5,"Marvelous - subtle, moving; one of the great films of 2003",1073779200,"01 11, 2004",2004,5613,"['saw', 'Translation', 'first',

619616,A3SDW7WS3YCCI7,B00005JMJ4,M. Castillo,"[4, 6]","What a movie. While more American movies are not this subtle ,this film exceeded my expectations. Starting with the opening scene (bootylicious Scarlett!!) this movie looks more like an indie flick than mainstream. Even the soundtrack is wisely used. I am a huge fan of Bill Murray and here he is so subtle, using his facial expression that talks more than a Tarantino's dialogue to describe a character. You see his face and you know what's going on in his life. Scarlett Johansson is very good as the young but unsatisfied wife of a photographer interpreted by Giovanni Ribisi. The chemistry between Bob and Scarlett is credible despite the difference of ages.

He lives through her youth and optomism, she through his age and experience. Together they teeter on the edge of sexual tension as well as burgeoning friendship.The movie has no big pay off. Many feel both are unhappy in there lives and maybe should leave them for each other, others feel that the age thing is just creepy, and yet others just don't get it.This is a study in basic human emotion and reaction to situation.

619619,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,B00005JMJ4,M. Dog,"[4, 9]","After reading a good portion of the reviews for this movie, it becomes clear that folks that like it feel so much superior to those that didn't. Any film with artistic aspirations seems to have a built-in ace in the hole: if you didn't like it, you didn't get it. Clearly, if you gave it less than 5 stars, it was over your head. According to the films' many ardent fans, those of us that didn't care for it must obviously fall into that vast, amorphous population so ruined by coarse American culture that a subtle and delicate piece of art like this is lost on us. Christ, Americans are so pedestrian in their tastes. It's rather embarrassing to be one, isn't it?I might add here that this little film did very well in America, did nicely on Oscar night, and the DVD sales aren't doing too badly either. So to say that this film can't be appreciated by the blunt, obvious taste of America is incorrect. I might also respond to those reviewers critical of American film making by saying that most of the great European directors, particularly the French New Wave, learned their craft by worshiping at the feet of the great American masters of the thirties and forties. Still, this film didn't do as well as, say, Bad Boys II. But then there is a good reason for that.I remember reading that Francois Truffaunt was a huge fan of American gangster films, and in fact remarked more than once he considered them the only kind of film that interested him. How could this be? How could the director of such a  tender character study as Jules and Jim get off on James Cagney and George Raft (who were the big-budget &quot;action&quot; stars of their day)? The answer is simple: in an action film (yes, like Rambo, which was a very good film, by the way), the situations are heightened to an unusual level, thus characters in the film are themselves heightened and brought into sharp focus. Action films, in the most dramatic of terms, always have a very powerful conflict that needs resolution. What characters do under the extreme pressure, in action, is very interesting. Thus the experience of watching a good action film can be a very intense experience. You folks that turn up your noses at Rambo are missing plenty of great cinema.What the zealous fans of this film don't get is this: it is very possible to dislike this film while at the same time &quot;getting&quot; every bloody, boring second of it. I mean, c'mon, somebody make me fall down laughing and call this film &quot;deep.&quot; Lost in Translation was a dull, pretensious, childishly obvious piece of filmmaking. It was a long student film about (what a surprise) alienation. Oooh, I bet Sofia Coppola feels alienated herself, much like the young female lead she posed in endless &quot;lonely girl&quot; shots, don't you think? It was not a terrible movie; just immature. It didn't have what a great film like Die Hard had: a great conflict involving great characters. Bill Murray saved the day by adding his talents, which made it worth a rental. The last scene, which was the only gripping scene in the film, was very moving. It just took way too much celluloid to get there.By the way, all you European lovers should go to Europe sometime, or anywhere in the world, for that matter. You know what they are watching? The current blockbusters from Hollywood. You know why? Because Hollywood learned long ago how to make a great movie that keeps butts in the seats. That's why. -Mykal Banta",3,"Hey, where's the guns?",1079913600,"03 22, 2004",2004,3454,"['reading', 'good', 'portion', 'reviews', 'movie', 'clear', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'superior', 'did', ""n't"", 'Any', 'film', 'artistic', 'aspirations', 'have', 'built-in', 'ace', 'hole', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Clearly', 'gave', 'less', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'head', 'According', 'films', 'many', 'ardent', 'fans', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'must', 'obviously', 'fall', 'vast', 'amorphous', 'population', 'so', 'ruined', 'coarse', 'American', 'culture', 'subtle', 'delicate', 'piece', 'art', 'lost', 'Christ', 'Americans', 'are', 'so', 'pedestrian', 'tastes', 'rather', 'embarrassing', 'be', 'one', ""n't"", 'might', 'add', 'here', 'little', 'film', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'America', 'did', 'nicely', 'Oscar', 'night', 'DVD', 'sales', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', 'too', 'badly', 'either', 'So', 'say', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'appreciated', 'blunt', 'obvious', 'taste', 'America', 'incorrect', 'might', 'also', 'respond', 'reviewers', 'critical', 'American', 'film', 'making', 'saying', 'most', 'great', 'European', 'directors', 'particularly', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'learned', 'craft', 'worshiping', 'feet', 'great', 'American', 'masters', 'thirties', 'forties', 'Still', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'well', 'say', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'II', 'then', 'good', 'reason', 'that.I', 'remember', 'reading', 'Francois', 'Truffaunt', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'American', 'gangster', 'films', 'fact', 'remarked', 'more', 'once', 'considered', 'only', 'kind', 'film', 'interested', 'How', 'could', 'be', 'How', 'could', 'director', 'such', 'tender', 'character', 'study', 'Jules', 'Jim', 'get', 'off', 'James', 'Cagney', 'George', 'Raft', 'who', 'were', 'big-budget', 'quot', 'action', 'quot', 'stars', 'day', 'answer', 'simple', 'action', 'film', 'yes', 'Rambo', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'way', 'situations', 'are', 'heightened', 'unusual', 'level', 'thus', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'heightened', 'brought', 'sharp', 'focus', 'Action', 'films', 'most', 'dramatic', 'terms', 'always', 'have', 'very', 'powerful', 'conflict', 'resolution', 'What', 'characters', 'do', 'extreme', 'pressure', 'action', 'very', 'interesting', 'Thus', 'experience', 'watching', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'intense', 'experience', 'folks', 'turn', 'up', 'noses', 'Rambo', 'are', 'missing', 'plenty', 'great', 'cinema.What', 'zealous', 'fans', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'possible', 'dislike', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'quot', 'getting', 'quot', 'bloody', 'boring', 'second', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'somebody', 'make', 'fall', 'down', 'laughing', 'call', 'film', 'quot', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'was', 'dull', 'pretensious', 'childishly', 'obvious', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'was', 'long', 'student', 'film', 'what', 'surprise', 'alienation', 'Oooh', 'bet', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'feels', 'alienated', 'much', 'young', 'female', 'lead', 'posed', 'endless', 'quot', 'lonely', 'girl', 'quot', 'shots', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'just', 'immature', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'great', 'film', 'Die', 'Hard', 'had', 'great', 'conflict', 'involving', 'great', 'characters', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'saved', 'day', 'adding', 'talents', 'made', 'rental', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'only', 'gripping', 'scene', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'just', 'took', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'celluloid', 'get', 'there.By', 'way', 'European', 'lovers', 'should', 'go', 'Europe', 'sometime', 'anywhere', 'world', 'matter', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'current', 'blockbusters', 'Hollywood', 'know', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'learned', 'long', 'ago', 'how', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'butts', 'seats', 'why', '-Mykal', 'Banta']",Lost in Translation

619621,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JMJ4,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[0, 3]","What category did it fall into? I absolutely loved it! Despite being told that I might not, and to indulge in some alcohol. I left out the alcohol, and found myself really enjoying the movie.I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, and I groaned when the opening shot was of Scarlett Johansson's butt in a pair of dreadful pink see-through panties. She is now hated by every woman, and loved by every man. Scarlett said that she was reluctant to be filmed in panties until Sofia Coppola modelled the panties herself to show that they would look horrible. The opening shot of Scarlett is actually influenced by a painting by John Kacere, which shows up later in the hotel.Bill Murray is a master at everything he does (except Caddyshack - don't start!), and my favourite movie up until seeing this was Groundhog Day. He's an older, subtler version of Jim Carrey, a simple facial expression will have you rolling about the floor with laughter. Particularly while he's shooting the commercials, the director is sooooo saying a lot more than just ""intensity"". Also the gym scene had me crying with laughter, and it got to the stage where it was painful. I loved how none of the Japanese is subtitled throughout the movie, leaving the audience just as lost as the characters. This was definitely a neat trick by Sophia, to really make you feel in touch with the lead characters.The whole movie is about feeling lonely, not fitting in, stuck in a strange country, isolated in a crowd, and enjoying the attention of a stranger. Scarlett's portrayal of a young wife is spot on. She suspects her husband of cheating; she can't understand the language; can't find anything to fill her day; and then can't sleep at night. The strange thing about Scarlett is she looks positively dowdy and frumpy in this movie, totally different from her glam red carpet persona, but the look is so appropriate for the movie.Regardless of what another reviewer said, this movie does not poke fun at the Japanese. Instead, the Japanese, although not highly featured, were hilarious, treating Bill Murray's character like some God. Plus, the language sounds really fun, although learning to speak or write it looks like trouble. Tokyo also looks like a really great place to visit, with all the bright lights, but I can imagine it would be also very difficult.There was a great chemistry between Scarlett & Bill, that definitely came across in the movie, although their relationship was kind of like Thora Birch's & Steve Buscemi's relationship in Ghost World. Which Scarlett also starred in, and boy, she's come a long way! Their characters, Bob and Charlotte, never actually introduce themselves to each other.Sofia Coppola wrote a lot of the film based on her life. The character of John (Giovanni Ribisi) was loosely based on her ex-husband Spike Jonze. Rumour has it that the Anna Faris' character, Kelly, was supposedly Cameron Diaz, with whom Spike Jonze worked on Being John Malkovich, though Coppola denied the connection in an Entertainment Weekly interview. (Friends fans: both Giovanni Ribisi & Anna Faris have starred in Friends!)Some dialogue was improvised, including Bill's lines in the photo shoot and his conversation with Scarlett about his Shiatsu massage.There are a couple of Sophia's trademarks in this including filming the sun coming through leaves of trees and filming from the outside of a car window looking in as the car moves. (Which in my personal opinion, is a really cool effect.)The film's Spanish title in South America, ""Perdido en Tokio"", and its Hebrew title in Israel, ""Avudim be-Tokio"", both mean ""Lost in Tokyo"", meaning that the titles themselves were literally lost in translation. The reason being that there is no Hebrew phrase ""Lost in Translation"". An Israeli wouldn't understand the phrase.In the hospital, the question that the elderly man with the cane tries to ask Bob (in Japanese) is: ""How many years have you been in Japan?"" Meanwhile, the diagnosis that Charlotte receives from the doctor (in Japanese) is that her toe is fractured, but taping is enough.The ending of the movie had me in tears, as you knew perfectly well, that it was just a short friendship, that wasn't meant to continue outside of Japan. You can feel that they're both going to miss each other, and that visit will be something they'll always remember. The kiss between Bill and Scarlett at the end of the movie was not in the script, but was an ""in the moment"" ad-lib between the performers. The whispered bit was a truly emotional moment, and is open to interpretation about what he said to her, and what it meant. I'm not going to do what some reviewers have done & turn the volume up loud, to see if they can hear what was said, or make up rude/stupid things that Bill said. It was the best part of the movie, apart from the gym scene. It was the perfect ending to a terrific movie. I loved the fact it just ended like that between them. Sofia could have gone in a completely different direction, or she could have made Bill actually say something to Scarlett, instead of whispering it.The extras include: a conversation with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola; deleted scenes; Kevin Shield's ""City Girl"" music video and Mattew's Best Hit TV-Extended scene.This is a really brilliant movie, and I urge everyone who hasn't seen it, to watch it at least once. I want my own copy now. And it's not often I say that about a borrowed DVD. In a few years, this will be considered a classic. Right now, it's just excellent.Oh, and watch right to the end of the credits. I know it's stupid to watch right to the end just for this, but a Japanese woman waves.

We are supposed to believe that Charlotte graduated from Yale 2 years ago and was married 3 years ago... when is the last time that a Junior at Yale got married?  And while she was at Yale, how was her boyfriend/fiance/husband being a hotshot LA photographer?  Why wouldn't they have waited until she was graduated, if they couldn't even live together until then?This might seem really minor, but it bothered me for the whole movie.

But the question is, do you want to watch this? If you're a hopeless romantic, you may find treasure in the subtleties and rather monotone projection of this film, which never picks up -- and that seems to be the filmmaker's point. But even understanding the intent, doesn't make for an entertaining viewing. I tried to give it a chance, but ultimately, it makes for slow, tedious viewing and makes one wonder why it was nominated for any Oscars at all, nevermind winning one. (perhaps the Coppola name had something to do with it?) There are those moviegoers and critics who defend a film against critics saying naysayers don't understand the intended style (but that type of defense could be used to justify any movie, from Ed Wood films to the Ernest series). Onto another point, this movie commits the same faults many Hollywood movies do when it selects a &quot;foreign&quot; country as its locale -- it marginalizes the &quot;minority&quot; characters, making them all one-dimensional caricatures, while the usually white characters go trotting about as if the world is their oyster. The movie plays for cheap laughs on how Japanese people try to speak English -- but they shouldn't be speaking English at all -- it's the main characters who should be trying to speak Japanese, and not act like the stereotypical &quot;dirty, arrogant Americans.&quot; There are at least a couple scenes in which Murray makes fun of Japanese people for not understanding English. Such scenes show the arrogance of many Americans, to think that others should cater to them, and bend to their culture. Hollywood constantly errs by taking what should be &quot;minority&quot; stories, and forcing white characters into the spotlight and shoving minorities to the sidelines, the background. (movies such as &quot;Last Samurai&quot; and &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; would have been much more interesting if they took the more interesting characters (the Japanese ones) and had them live, breathe, on their own without always being seen from the pov of the white character).

Rather than block out all the peripheral noises and background talk, Coppola brings these things to the forefront on many occasions thereby adding the details of ongoing life to her story. In fact, ""Lost in Translation"" is all about the details: all the junk both petty and important that makes up a life that has nothing to do with the big stuff like Love, Hate, Birth and Death. It's the man in the Tokyo Hyatt talking about the Yankees, the way the girl is looking at her boyfriend in a Pachinko lounge or Charlotte quietly and reverently observing a Japanese wedding ceremony and how the groom takes the hand of his bride so as to help her up a flight of stairs. Coppola's camera and microphones linger over these things so lovingly and without any judgment that many times, even when Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and Bob (Bill Murray) are on camera, they take over...become more important.The story of Charlotte and Bob is very prim and almost Victorian in its quaint propriety. It's also the story of two lost souls, both unhappy in their current relationships, who take the time to get to know each other, to become friends. Bill Murray need only raise an eyebrow to elicit laughs from an audience but here he takes the time and energy to actually give a performance not based on shtick.""Lost in Translation"" is a simple story of two lost people who find a kind of happiness and acceptance with each other.

619636,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005JMJ4,Michael Crane,"[7, 9]","&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a moving film filled with light humor and heart.  It has comedic and dramatic elements to it, and the two play together beautifully.  The film is definitely one of those that people will either love it or hate it; take it or leave it, etc.  Either way, it is a film that easily stays in your head after it is long over.Bob Harris is currently in Tokyo to shoot a whisky commercial.  He was once a movie star but is now reduced to doing product endorsements.  It's easy to see that he isn't the most pleased with how things have gone in his life--but at the same time, he doesn't seem very regretful or overly depressed.  One night in a bar, he meets a young lady by the name of  Charlotte, who's also visiting in Tokyo due to her workaholic husband who's doing some photo shoots there.  Bob and Charlotte connect with one another in very little time and a unique bond of friendship is formed.Whether the connection will be a short-lived or a long-term relationship is besides the point, but what is the point is those little connections we make on a daily basis and how much of a profound effect they can have on us.  Like the characters and the story, the film is superbly subtle and low-keyed.  The end result is a very entertaining and well-made film.  Bill Murray is outstanding as Bob Harris; knowing how to be comedic without ever breaking character.  I can now see why he won a Golden Globe for his performance and am happy that he has also received an Academy Award nomination (which he really deserves, I think).  Scarlett Johansson is an absolute joy to watch in her portrayal of the sweet and confused &quot;Charlotte.&quot;  And even though we may not see much of him in the film, I must say that Giovanni Ribisi does a great job as being Charlotte's husband who appears to be more in love with his work than her.The movie is extremely well-directed and well-written by Sofia Coppola.  What stands out especially the writing, as the conversations flow and sound real, and do not appear artificial to our ears.  Coppola is great at making us see these characters as real human beings rather than fictional film characters.  She really establishes what she wants in her film and how she plans to achieve it.  I also love how she chose Japan as the setting for this movie, as it is very easy for one to feel &quot;lost&quot; as the characters do.Not only is the film a great viewing, but the DVD package is quite impressive as well.  It may not have as many &quot;bells and whistles&quot; as most DVDs do, but it really doesn't need all of that (however, I would've liked a commentary track with Coppola and Murray).  Extras included are a Behind-the-Scenes documentary, extended and deleted scenes, a conversation with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola featurette, a music video and more.  The best feature is an extended scene of Bob's appearance on an over-the-top Japanese talk show.  It is outrageously hilarious, and I encourage everybody to check it out as soon as the movie is over.  A downfall of the DVD is the annoying commercials at the beginning that you cannot skip, but have to fast-forward the whole thing if you desire to go straight to the menu.  I thought we were beyond this once we went from VHS to DVDs.  Apparently, I was wrong.  Still, not a shady DVD package, if you want my honest opinion.&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a superbly done film filled with humor and a number of profound little moments.  The movie is well-directed, well-written, and well-acted.  There's always a chance of you not liking the movie, but that's not a dangerous chance to take.  If you let hype consume you, then you will most likely be disappointed.  If you're willing to be open-minded and not make any judgments until the end credits, then the chances of you enjoying the film increases greatly.  A very nice and subtle movie that has more to it than what the eye simply sees. -Michael Crane",5,&quot;I'm trying to organize a prison break...&quot;,1076716800,"02 14, 2004",2004,3942,"['quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'moving', 'film', 'filled', 'light', 'humor', 'heart', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'two', 'play', 'together', 'beautifully', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'people', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'take', 'leave', 'etc', 'way', 'film', 'easily', 'head', 'long', 'over.Bob', 'Harris', 'currently', 'Tokyo', 'shoot', 'whisky', 'commercial', 'was', 'once', 'movie', 'star', 'now', 'reduced', 'doing', 'product', 'endorsements', 'easy', 'see', ""n't"", 'most', 'pleased', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'gone', 'life', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'regretful', 'overly', 'depressed', 'One', 'night', 'bar', 'young', 'lady', 'name', 'Charlotte', 'who', 'also', 'visiting', 'Tokyo', 'due', 'workaholic', 'husband', 'who', 'doing', 'photo', 'shoots', 'there', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'connect', 'one', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'unique', 'bond', 'friendship', 'formed.Whether', 'connection', 'will', 'be', 'short-lived', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'point', 'what', 'point', 'little', 'connections', 'make', 'daily', 'basis', 'how', 'much', 'profound', 'effect', 'can', 'have', 'characters', 'story', 'film', 'superbly', 'subtle', 'low-keyed', 'end', 'result', 'very', 'entertaining', 'well-made', 'film', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'outstanding', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'knowing', 'how', 'be', 'comedic', 'ever', 'breaking', 'character', 'can', 'now', 'see', 'why', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'performance', 'am', 'happy', 'also', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'really', 'think', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'absolute', 'joy', 'watch', 'portrayal', 'sweet', 'confused', 'quot', 'Charlotte.', 'quot', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'much', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'Charlotte', 'husband', 'who', 'be', 'more', 'love', 'work', 'her.The', 'movie', 'extremely', 'well-directed', 'well-written', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'What', 'out', 'especially', 'writing', 'conversations', 'flow', 'sound', 'real', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'artificial', 'ears', 'Coppola', 'great', 'making', 'see', 'characters', 'real', 'human', 'beings', 'rather', 'fictional', 'film', 'characters', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'how', 'achieve', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'chose', 'Japan', 'setting', 'movie', 'very', 'easy', 'one', 'feel', 'quot', 'lost', 'quot', 'characters', 'do.Not', 'only', 'film', 'great', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'package', 'quite', 'impressive', 'well', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'quot', 'bells', 'whistles', 'quot', 'most', 'DVDs', 'do', 'really', ""n't"", 'need', 'however', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'commentary', 'track', 'Coppola', 'Murray', 'Extras', 'included', 'are', 'Behind-the-Scenes', 'documentary', 'extended', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'conversation', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'featurette', 'music', 'video', 'more', 'best', 'feature', 'extended', 'scene', 'Bob', 'appearance', 'over-the-top', 'Japanese', 'talk', 'show', 'outrageously', 'hilarious', 'encourage', 'everybody', 'check', 'out', 'as', 'soon', 'movie', 'over', 'downfall', 'DVD', 'annoying', 'commercials', 'beginning', 'can', 'not', 'skip', 'have', 'fast-forward', 'whole', 'thing', 'desire', 'go', 'straight', 'menu', 'thought', 'were', 'once', 'went', 'VHS', 'DVDs', 'Apparently', 'was', 'wrong', 'Still', 'not', 'shady', 'DVD', 'package', 'want', 'honest', 'opinion.', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'superbly', 'done', 'film', 'filled', 'humor', 'number', 'profound', 'little', 'moments', 'movie', 'well-directed', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'always', 'chance', 'not', 'liking', 'movie', 'not', 'dangerous', 'chance', 'take', 'let', 'hype', 'consume', 'then', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', ""'re"", 'willing', 'be', 'open-minded', 'not', 'make', 'judgments', 'end', 'credits', 'then', 'chances', 'enjoying', 'film', 'greatly', 'very', 'nice', 'subtle', 'movie', 'more', 'what', 'eye', 'simply', '-Michael', 'Crane']",Lost in Translation

This is a great movie but perhaps it's too sly and understated in a time when over-the-top is almost the rule in movies. Murray is dead-on and hilarious but he doesn't crack jokes or clown around much to make you smile, it's more subtle than that.Most of the humor is in the gentle mocking of Japanese culture and the two leads' reactions to it. Not in a mean-spirited way but there are aspects of their culture, especially the way they react to our culture, that are very amusing. This was understated, too, and well-handled since it could easily have become too mocking.Johannson is also great, this was the first time I'd seen her in a film and I was SO glad they didn't cheapen their friendship with any Hollywood-style romance. She's far too young for him and they both know it but they also are aware that it's unfortunate because they would have made a good couple. I dreaded the sight of them going the May-December route right up until the last moment and then I almost applauded.I don't have any complaint to make about this film except that I wish we could see these characters again.

619638,AMWSZ61FILX2J,B00005JMJ4,Michael Erisman,"[3, 5]","It is hard to describe this film.  To do so would leave the other person somewhat bewildered as to why you would be suggesting they spend an hour or two of their life watching other people just hang out.  In fact, that just about does describe the film.  Set in Tokyo, a famous actor is being paid well to shoot commercials about whiskey, while being shouted at in Japanese.  In the same hotel is a young wife who is traveling with her photographer husband, and is left to wander around while he works all the time.And?  Well that's about it.  Half the time while watching the film I thought to myself, ""something did get lost in translation"", because how in the world did this film get nominated for best picture?  Yet, the rest of the time I did get drawn in to the wonderful mood.  Life sometimes finds us in moments which create a whole lifetime by themselves. We find ourselves somewhere we do not really want to be, but when connections are made, we may not want to leave. Once back in our routine these moments may fade away, but while in them, we lived briefly another life altogether. This is the way the film ""worked"" for me.  I did not want the film to end, but yet I did not want anything ""big"" to happen either as that would have spoiled the reality.Is the acting as good as people say it is?  Who knows?  I guess I really did buy into these people, as if it really was Bill Murray, stuck in a hotel and surrounded by glad-handling Japanese people, and connecting with this young woman in a friendship that is full of sexual tension which is thankfully never acted on.  So I guess the acting is sound in that regard.Overall, I think this is a film that a person will either be drawn in to, or bored to death.  But for what it is, it does capture the emotions and mood of the moment well.

And people have questioned the ""lack of no plot"" (as some would say), and the ""weird sexual relationship"" between the two protagonists. But this film, is like having one of those sernedity moments, of just exploring you mind on your life, as you stare up into space.But I think that people will get disappointed, that with all the ""critics"" hype, they expect a clear beginning,middle, and end. And, I think that if you never felt like you never had a connection with a person you just met, than perhaps you wont understand the relationship between Bob and Charlotte. There relationship is nothing sexual, but you can tell that, they were made for each other. There soul-mates that share a connection. And Tokyo acts as a background to all these, giving the feeling of loss, and isolation from their home(America). But there relationship contents full of unqiue honest moments, in which they use each other to understand themselves better. Its kinda like one of those close intimate friendships, where you find a instant bond with each other, as well as learning from each other, and than parting. Is not sad, its bittersweet and leaves the sense of moving forward in time.I must say that this film, is gorgeous in showing the beauty of the city, and Sofia Coppola, has done it again!!

619644,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JMJ4,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[8, 16]","You really know there is a serious flip-flop in the way Hollywood thinks now adays when one of the most highly anticipated films of the year is an ""art-house"" feature. Lost in Translation is the second directorial project from Sofia Coppola, the daughter of Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, after her critically praised debut, The Virgin Suicides. Another rising star associated with Translation, Scarlett Johansson, has given further interest in the project thanks to her powerful performances in other art-house films like The Man Who Wasn't There and Ghost World. But if one had to pick out only one aspect that raised the most eyebrows concerning this film, it would have to be the involvement of comedian actor Bill Murray, best known for his hilarious performances in Ghostbusters and Caddyshack. Can an actor who is so embedded in the public consciousness as a comedian pull off a powerful dramatic performance? Looking back to the past for reference, the answer lies between both yes (Robin Williams) and no (Jim Carrey).The story focuses on separate lifes of a struggling actor and a young woman as they cross paths and discover that everybody wants to be found. Bob Harris was once a prosperous television star but that regal star lifestyle he once had has long since past as he currently reduced to promoting whiskey in Japan. At the same time, a young woman named Charlotte is tagging along with her photographer husband but feels totally out of place as he seems to be more focused on his work then her. Both Bob and Charlotte feel they have lost what they wanted in life and don't know where to go from here. Then one night, the two cross paths in the bar of the luxury hotel in which they are staying and from there spark up a surprising friendship together. In their time together, they discover the excitement they had thought they lost in their lives and break away from the despair that had once brought them down. The story for Lost in Translation is one that, if in the hands of another director, would have been mediocre fare but Coppola presents an atmospheric quality that keeps the feature interesting, yet at the same time thought provoking. The setting of the film in Japan is another stroke of genius considering the subject matter the feature deals with, that of necessity and happiness, which are values and topics greatly treasured in Japanese culture.The cast for Translation is limited based on the number of performers but perhaps that is to its advantage as the story mainly focuses on the roles of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. Though some questioned whether Bill Murray was qualified for this role based on his mostly comedic career, such doubts are quickly erased as he gives a memorable dramatic performance that is not without many comedic quips. Murray's deliverance of dialogue is rich with sarcasm and dark humor, which makes the performance all the more unforgettable. Scarlett Johansson gives yet another delightful performance, this time in the role of a lonely young woman who is searching for purpose in life. Johansson presents such a quality and charm about herself that one can't help but notice her where she is on screen. But it is the chemistry between Murray and Johansson enacted on the big screen that ends up complimenting both their separate performances and intensifies the overall emotional impact of the feature's story. There are few roles focused on outside of the previously mentioned duo but what is presented is a mixed bag of performances. Anna Faris, who portrays a good friend of Johansson's husband, presents as best of a performance as the material that is given to her and though her character emphasizes Charlotte's sense of loneliness with her husband caring more of her then his own wife, one begins to feel as though she is presented too much or there wasn't as much involvement with her as there could have been. The same goes to Giovanni Ribisi, Johansson's husband in the film, but at it was said before, they are not the focus of the feature and thus are less primary to the overall story, so there shouldn't be so much complaint.Overall, Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is an art-house gem that shows that companionship can be found in the most unlikely of places and gives emotional hope for those looking for it. The feature's entire emotional emphasis rides on the chemistry of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson and it works exceedingly well, beyond what even the most star-studded major release this year has done, which gives further complimentary criticism to the duo. But, as with most films, along with the good comes the bad as well. As was said previously, the Japanese background compliments the story of the film exceptionally but at times there were awkward moments that weren't necessarily needed, such as the scene with Murray's character sitting alone in a Japanese strip club waiting for Charlotte. And the ending, though expected, left the audience with the lingering feeling of being a bit of a downer after such an emotionally uplifting story. But all-in-all, Lost in Translation rides on the shoulders of its leading stars to an emotional and fulfilling performance.",4,The Moose Hole - No Loss in 'Translation' Here,1077148800,"02 19,

619649,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JMJ4,Miles D. Moore,"[18, 21]","Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" is a delicate, well-acted, visually astonishing film about the dislocation of being alone in a foreign culture and the desperate need for human connection. At the heart of the story is the brief encounter between Bob, a middle-aged movie star in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial, and Charlotte, a bored young wife left alone in Tokyo by her self-centered, workaholic photographer husband. Both are adrift and without moorings in a society where virtually nothing is familiar or reassuring--except, as it develops, each other. The film is essentially a string of vignettes, without much in the way of a narrative line, and the story--such as it is--loses momentum in the last half-hour. But that doesn't matter much, thanks to the quiet, delicately nuanced performances of Bill Murray as Bob and Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte. Murray, especially, is revelatory: his face in middle age has taken on some of the craggy gravitas of Robert Mitchum and Johnny Cash, and the wounded, melancholy look in his eyes haunts you long after the movie has ended. This is not to say that Murray doesn't give us some laughs; there are bits of business here as funny as anything he has ever done. (Chief among them are Murray's collision with a runaway exercise machine; his embarrassed encounter with a clownish talk-show host; and his martyrdom at the hands of an uninvited Japanese dominatrix who orders him to ""lip"" her stockings.) But it is the poignant near-romance between Murray and Johansson that you will remember, as well as the stunning photography by Lance Acord, presenting Tokyo as a cross between Las Vegas and the Brave New World.",5,"A dreamy, funny, poignant little film.",1064188800,"09 22, 2003",2003,1672,"['Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'delicate', 'well-acted', 'visually', 'astonishing', 'film', 'dislocation', 'being', 'alone', 'foreign', 'culture', 'desperate', 'need', 'human', 'connection', 'heart', 'story', 'brief', 'encounter', 'Bob', 'middle-aged', 'movie', 'star', 'Tokyo', 'shoot', 'whiskey', 'commercial', 'Charlotte', 'bored', 'young', 'wife', 'left', 'alone', 'Tokyo', 'self-centered', 'workaholic', 'photographer', 'husband', 'are', 'adrift', 'moorings', 'society', 'where', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'familiar', 'reassuring', 'except', 'other', 'film', 'essentially', 'string', 'vignettes', 'much', 'way', 'narrative', 'line', 'story', 'such', 'momentum', 'last', 'half-hour', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'thanks', 'quiet', 'delicately', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Bob', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Charlotte', 'Murray', 'especially', 'revelatory', 'face', 'middle', 'age', 'taken', 'craggy', 'gravitas', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'wounded', 'melancholy', 'look', 'eyes', 'haunts', 'long', 'movie', 'ended', 'not', 'say', 'Murray', ""n't"", 'give', 'laughs', 'are', 'bits', 'business', 'here', 'as', 'funny', 'anything', 'ever', 'done', 'Chief', 'are', 'Murray', 'collision', 'runaway', 'exercise', 'machine', 'embarrassed', 'encounter', 'clownish', 'talk-show', 'host', 'martyrdom', 'hands', 'uninvited', 'Japanese', 'dominatrix', 'who', 'orders', 'lip', 'stockings', 'poignant', 'near-romance', 'Murray', 'Johansson', 'will', 'remember', 'as', 'well', 'stunning', 'photography', 'Lance', 'Acord', 'presenting', 'Tokyo', 'cross', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Brave', 'New', 'World']",Lost in Translation

First, filming themovie in Japan was not only a way to capture the two maincharacters out of their element (which was the brilliant, centralpoint of the film), but it took ME out of MY element, which wasrefreshing. I loved the nightlife, the colorful characters, thestrange looking food, the cherry blossoms in the gardens...the setting for the film was magnificent.As for the two main leads, the acting is superb. Bill Murraytakes a huge leap playing an aging, burned out actor with maritalwoes and hits the mark, dead on. Scarlett Johansson approachesthe youthful object of  his affection with understated sweetnessand grace. Neither  actor overplays or underplays their part, whichis rare in film. Both are spot on.And for the story. How refreshing to explore the complexity ofmale/female bonding without resorting to raunchy sex scenesand offensive language. Maybe the reason why so manyviewers are disappointed in this film is because of its quiet,thoughtful, deeply tender approach to the subject matter. There'sno fast cars or nudity in this film; just the story of two lost soulscompletely out of their element who find each other and reawakenin each other something both of them thought they had lost.At the end of the movie, as the Jesus and Mary Chain song plays andthe two part ways, I always get teary-eyed. If someone can tell mewhat the two whisper to each other, I'd really like to know. But thenagain, maybe that would be giving too much away in this brilliant gemof a film.

619652,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JMJ4,mirasreviews,"[10, 22]","Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an aging American movie star who is in Tokyo to film a whisky commercial. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a young wife left mostly alone while her photographer husband is on assignment in Japan. Both of these people feel adrift from their families and alone in a strange city, and both are insomniac. So it's not surprising that they run into each other in the middle of the night in the lounge at the hotel where they are both staying, and they immediately recognize their shared state of mind. Drawn to each other by empathy and mutual mild but persistent dissatisfaction with their lives, Bob and Charlotte spend time together and develop a unique friendship in spite of their differences in age and background.""Lost in Translation"" is writer/ director Sofia Coppola's second feature film. And contrary to the critical acclaim, it isn't as good as her first film, ""The Virgin Suicides"". ""The Virgin Suicides"" was an acclaimed novel which Coppola skillfully adapted for the screen. Her beautiful  and enigmatic interpretation rightfully established Sofia Coppola as an up-and-coming directing talent. She's a good director, but ""Lost in Translation"" shows that her original writing needs work.""Lost in Translation"" starts out well enough. We are introduced to two characters who seem like they will be interesting. And several  scenes that cleverly play cultural idiosyncrasies for laughs give us the impression that this will be a comedy, or at least a ""dramedy"". Unfortunately, ""Lost in Translation"" doesn't maintain its comic charm into the second half. And the relationship that is at the center of the film isn't quite credible. The film's biggest problem by far is that Charlotte's character is severely under-written. She is presented as a clever and literate person, but she barely speaks. She doesn't articulate enough about herself to make herself interesting -to the audience or, it seems to me, to Bob either. There isn't much action or other characters that could be used to elucidate Charlotte or Bob's characters. This is a relationship film, a character drama. The relationship and the characterizations rely on what the characters say to each other and about themselves. Bill Murray makes Bob interesting and convincing, and Murray's performance essentially carries the film. But there is so little of Charlotte to wrap one's mind around that her relationship with Bob doesn't seem at all likely. And much of the dialogue between them is unnatural and absurdly clich&eacute;d. Most puzzling about all of this is that Charlotte appears to be a semi-autobiographical character. Her mannerisms and way of dress are like Sofia Coppola's. They both dabbled in photography. They had both been married two years at the time this film was written. I get the impression that Charlotte is Coppola's younger self. So it is difficult to comprehend why the character is so under-written. Coppola should know her in and out. Does she know Charlotte so well that she didn't realize that the audience would need more clues in order to get a clear picture of the character? I'm just guessing here.""Lost in Translation"" takes place in Tokyo, but it could take place anywhere. The Japanese city provides a colorful backdrop and the opportunity for some comic relief. The fact that the two characters are somewhat stranded in a foreign land and therefore perhaps more emotionally isolated than they would be at home makes it easier to bring them together. But melancholy insomniacs meet in bars in the United States just as well.  Setting the film in Tokyo could easily be interpreted as laziness or an attempt to compensate for a weak script.I don't usually give films that are so flawed 4 stars, but Bill Murray's performance and the comic culture clashing of the film's first half make ""Lost in Translation"" worth seeing. Sofia Coppola has plenty of directing talent, but if she's going to write original screenplays, she needs to make sure that her characters are well-drawn and that the tone and freshness of her writing carry throughout the entire film.",4,One Impressive Performance.

I have been a fan of Bill Murray for as long as I can remember and the film was receiving a lot of praise from the critics. I set out to watch a film that was original and inventive. Instead, I got to sit through 2 hours of a boring and extremely overrated film. Sofia Coppola did write an excellent script. The idea behind the film has a lot of potential, and the entire film was shot in Tokyo which added realism to the film. But, the story just seemed to never go anywhere and after the film ends, you don't feel any closer to the characters than you did at the start of the film.I simply do not understand why Bill Murray is being nominated for Best Actor for his performance in Lost in Translation. Before watching this film, I was excited to see his performance because all the critics were saying that only Bill Murray could have pulled off a role like this. I was expecting to have a lot of laughs and to be impressed with the performance overal. Bill Murray's role consisted of two things. The first was sitting around in bars getting drunk and talking with Scarlett Johansson. The second is singing karaoke. These are two things that any actor could have done. There was absolutely nothing special about his performance at all.Unfortunately, Lost in Translation is the type of film that you either really enjoy, or you really hate. There really isn't any enjoyable middle ground in this film. I personally think the film is extremely overrated. Watching Bill Murray get drunk and sing karaoke does not equal an enjoyable film for me.  Now, fans of the film may not appreciate my honesty. However, with over 700 reviews and only a 3 star rating overall, I am not the only one who feels this way. Soffia Coppola may have set out with good intentions.

Indeed, Tokyo is only a place that triggers and exposes the deep need for change, albeit short lived because at the end, when the actor's job is done, he knows that now matter how much he found in Charlotte some comfort in his middle age crisis that was turning into affection and intimacy, and no matter how much Charlotte found in the actor the stimulation and closeness she lacks in her marriage, each will soon have to go back to their respective lives and families.The last scene when Harris stops his cab after spotting Charlotte and runs to her, whispering something that remains intelligible, then they kiss for the first time, and he departs smiling, was a very powerful one indeed..it opens lots of unanswered possibilities as to the nature of this brief conversation, but it really does not matter because they finally depart for the first time in their stay satisfied.Bill Murray, I believe contributed greatly to the movie's success..He is a truly comedy genius that reminds me of Peter Sellers or even Louis De Funes, actors who can express so much just with one look.Scarlett Johansson was a very able match, playing against a comedy giant like Murray, and I believe she is one of the best actresses of her generation, (and yes she has a really sweet laugh).The writing was excellent and Coppola managed to infuse gentle humor with three dimensional characters and with lots of sympathy, compassion and dignity.Lost In Translation therefore is a type of movie that is rarely filmed these days, one that is beautifully shot, written,and directed by a woman who proved that the term Daddy's girl is in her case, very well earned.",5,Daddy's Girl,1082246400,"04 18, 2004",2004,3085,"['nice', 'dream', 'wake', 'up', 'smile', 'face', 'will', 'turn', 'make', 'day', 'exactly', 'feeling', 'got', 'watching', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'second', 'feature', 'acclaimed', 'debut', 'Virgin', 'Suicides.The', 'first', 'thing', 'struck', 'was', 'how', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'simple', 'gentle', 'plot', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'how', 'deeply', 'significant', 'dealing', 'themes', 'many', 'viewers', 'can', 'identify', 'about', 'friendship', 'alienation', 'loneliness.Certainly', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'opening', 'scenes', 'would', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'saying', 'Cinema', 'history..one', 'will', ""'stare"", 'right', 'face', 'will', 'definitely', 'bring', 'smile.Bob', 'Harris', 'aging', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'clearly', 'seen', 'better', 'roles', 'Tokyo', 'shoot', 'whiskey', 'commercial', 'also', 'staying', 'same', 'hotel', 'Charlotte', 'east', 'side', 'intellectual', 'young', 'wife', 'who', 'very', 'busy', 'photographer', 'husband.In', 'discovering', 'whole', 'new', 'city', 'finding', 'difficulties', 'adjusting', 'jet', 'lag', 'language', 'barrier', 'respective', 'state', 'loneliness', 'away', 'home', 'meet', 'up', 'form', 'friendship', 'will', 'help', 'cope', 'temporary', 'bewildered', 'confused', 'situation.Through', 'encounters', 'learn', 'friendship', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'sealed', 'homesickness', 'found', 'other', 'needed', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'enlivened', 'dull', 'routine', 'lives', 'Tokyo', 'US', 'Indeed', 'Tokyo', 'only', 'place', 'triggers', 'deep', 'need', 'change', 'short', 'lived', 'because', 'end', 'when', 'actor', 'job', 'done', 'now', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'found', 'Charlotte', 'comfort', 'middle', 'age', 'crisis', 'was', 'turning', 'affection', 'intimacy', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'Charlotte', 'found', 'actor', 'stimulation', 'closeness', 'marriage', 'will', 'soon', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'respective', 'lives', 'families.The', 'last', 'scene', 'when', 'Harris', 'cab', 'spotting', 'Charlotte', 'whispering', 'something', 'intelligible', 'then', 'kiss', 'first', 'time', 'smiling', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'one', 'indeed..it', 'lots', 'unanswered', 'possibilities', 'nature', 'brief', 'conversation', 'really', 'not', 'matter', 'finally', 'depart', 'first', 'time', 'stay', 'satisfied.Bill', 'Murray', 'believe', 'contributed', 'greatly', 'movie', 'success..He', 'truly', 'comedy', 'genius', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'even', 'Louis', 'De', 'Funes', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'express', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'one', 'look.Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'was', 'very', 'able', 'match', 'playing', 'comedy', 'giant', 'Murray', 'believe', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'generation', 'yes', 'really', 'sweet', 'laugh', '.The', 'writing', 'was', 'excellent', 'Coppola', 'managed', 'infuse', 'gentle', 'humor', 'three', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'lots', 'sympathy', 'compassion', 'dignity.Lost', 'Translation', 'therefore', 'type', 'movie', 'rarely', 'filmed', 'days', 'one', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'written', 'directed', 'woman', 'who', 'proved', 'term', 'Daddy', 'girl', 'case', 'very', 'well', 'earned']",Lost in Translation

So, I was happy to see it at the video store and decided to rent it before I bought it. I'm glad I only rented it. Not that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a bad movie, but it is one I won't want to see again for quite some time. It is very slow moving and requires a lot of patience when watching, which I don't mind as long as the characters are interesting, and the two leads are. Bill Murray is very good in the lead role and deserves his nomination, but the Oscar should and will most likely go to Sean Penn for his incredible work in &quot;Mystic River.&quot; Scarlett Johansson, who was only 18 years old when this film was made,  will become an even greater actress over time with maturity. You can just tell she has potential to be with the elite in the near future. The thing I enjoyed most about this film is the realism in the acting and the dialogue. It feels more &quot;real&quot; than &quot;hollywood&quot; which is hard to come by these days. For instance, when S.J's character asks Bill Murray's about whether marriage gets any easier over time. He simply and quickly responds NO, instead of lecturing about how the good always outweighs the bad in any relationship, which most films love to throw in. The whispered ending was excellent, and I'm glad Sophie Coppola's script didn't let us hear what he said to her. Now, after all these positives you are probably asking why I gave it only 3 stars. Well to be honest, it wasn't quite what I expected and I thought the hour and a half run time could even have been trimmed down quite a bit more.

I guess it is true it had virtually no plot. But the brilliant character study of a man realizing he's passed the high point of his life and is on the downward slide was unforgettable and poignant. The picture is completed by the intersection of his life with that of someone who has all of her possibilities in front of her, although she has a hit a momentary bump in the road. It adds more poignancy still that she is a gorgeous young woman who he probably could become sexually involved with, but won't, and with whom he falls into a rather chaste love. It's not that he's not looking for love or solace--he is. He casually sleeps with the chanteuse. But makes sure he doesn't interfere with Scarlett's life. He turns her loose, and doesn't lean on her. It has a kind of Victorian agony in the choices made. At the end, in the famous scene where he whispers something you cannot hear, everyone is left to give their own interpretation and fill in the blanks. I would guess, consistent with how I interpret the movie, that he said: ""I love you, but this is as far as it goes. Call me sometime, and let me know if you ever need help.

Someone mentioned Remains of the Day.  And, yes I would agree that this might be seen as similar.  But, to me the point was a little different.  That story was a little more tragic in a way.  I was left with a sad feeling with Remains of the Day.  In Lost in Translation, I felt as if I knew these two characters and it was just beautiful.  It must just be something you would have to have experienced on some level.  Not to say you would have to have been in the same situation.  But, to have felt this way at some point in your life.  The movie, to me, is about cherishing those tiny irretrievable moments in your life that haunt you forever.  Also, letting something wonderful be what it is, and not pushing for more.  The acting was the best.  And, Sophia has one of the deepest hearts in the world for pulling this seemingly simple idea off.  It's something I've never seen before.  And, doubt I'll ever see again.

She couldn't find a line because in her mind no line existed. As director she wanted the scene, but as screenwriter she had nothing.

Fowler ""ben1283""","[6, 7]","In the UK Lost In Translation has only been on release a couple of weeks, and when I finally got round to seeing it last night I was blown away.  The movie's about two people who find each other at a time in their lives where nothing seems to fit, where they're desperate, bored and lonely.  Bob Harris (Murray) used to be a famous movie star but now he's sold out, travelling to Japan to film a set of whisky commercials.  Staying at the same hotel is Charlotte (Johannsson), who is the centre of the realisation that she doesn't know her husband of two years (Ribisi) and feels unable to explain it to anyone.  The two people eventually meet, finding solace in the amazing backdrop of Tokyo arcades, temples and karaoke bars.  Many may accuse the film of being boring, and it's true, nothing really happens.  But that's the point.  The characters don't need any plot contrivances to push their relationship forward.  This is a movie about the kind of meeting of someone you know you're in love with from moment one, your soul-mate, but knowing that it can never work out.  In a lot of ways this sounds clich&eacute;d, but LIT is anything but.  It's focus on the blossoming relationship of the couple is inspiring.I've never seen Murray in a better role, his kind of world-weary character hidden behind a comic defense is nothing short of brilliant.  Johannsson is a genuine star in the making, and deserves the highest kind of praise for her performance.  Holding herself confidently with a hidden vulnerability, it's a multi-faceted performance which complements Murray's one perfectly.  There are also some nice supporting turns and characters hidden here as well.  Ribisi (narrator of Coppola's previous movie The Virgin Suicides) is just the kind of person you meet in real life who's primarily concerned with image, with having the perfect wife and the perfect job, rather than whether this is what he really wants.  There's also a hilarious character in a young actress starring in a kung-fu movie.  If Bob and Charlotte are the emotional centrepiece of the movie, then she is the laughs.  Pretentious, self-abosorbed but totally believable, she's a great comic actress.Crucially, Coppola proves with Lost In Translation that she's a dab hand at creating dreamy landscapes, believable relationships and subtly complicated characters.  It's particularly impressive that she not only directed but also wrote the movie and shows her to be one of the most promising new directors in Hollywood (alongside Christopher Nolan).  Just like The Virgin Suicides, there are a lot of silent shots of landscape, of characters staring into the distance.  With Lost In Translation, much of these shots are of Johannsson visiting temples or watching flower arranging.  These provide a nice counterpoint to the humour the film makes of Japan in the director of Bob's commercials and a hilarious Japanese talk show.  LIT is an achievement of the best sort: gently humorous, beautiful, and genuinely touching.",5,Best movie I've seen this year,1074556800,"01 20, 2004",2004,2997,"['UK', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'only', 'been', 'release', 'couple', 'weeks', 'when', 'finally', 'got', 'round', 'seeing', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'other', 'time', 'lives', 'where', 'nothing', 'fit', 'where', ""'re"", 'desperate', 'bored', 'lonely', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'Murray', 'used', 'be', 'famous', 'movie', 'star', 'now', 'sold', 'out', 'travelling', 'Japan', 'film', 'set', 'whisky', 'commercials', 'Staying', 'same', 'hotel', 'Charlotte', 'Johannsson', 'who', 'centre', 'realisation', ""n't"", 'know', 'husband', 'two', 'years', 'Ribisi', 'unable', 'explain', 'anyone', 'two', 'people', 'eventually', 'meet', 'finding', 'solace', 'amazing', 'backdrop', 'Tokyo', 'arcades', 'temples', 'karaoke', 'bars', 'Many', 'may', 'accuse', 'film', 'being', 'boring', 'true', 'nothing', 'really', 'point', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'push', 'relationship', 'forward', 'movie', 'kind', 'meeting', 'someone', 'know', ""'re"", 'love', 'moment', 'one', 'soul-mate', 'knowing', 'can', 'never', 'work', 'out', 'lot', 'ways', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'LIT', 'anything', 'focus', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'couple', 'inspiring.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Murray', 'better', 'role', 'kind', 'world-weary', 'character', 'hidden', 'comic', 'defense', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'Johannsson', 'genuine', 'star', 'making', 'highest', 'kind', 'praise', 'performance', 'Holding', 'confidently', 'hidden', 'vulnerability', 'multi-faceted', 'performance', 'Murray', 'one', 'perfectly', 'are', 'also', 'nice', 'supporting', 'turns', 'characters', 'hidden', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Ribisi', 'narrator', 'Coppola', 'previous', 'movie', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'just', 'kind', 'person', 'meet', 'real', 'life', 'who', 'primarily', 'concerned', 'image', 'having', 'perfect', 'wife', 'perfect', 'job', 'rather', 'what', 'really', 'also', 'hilarious', 'character', 'young', 'actress', 'starring', 'kung-fu', 'movie', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'emotional', 'centrepiece', 'movie', 'then', 'laughs', 'Pretentious', 'self-abosorbed', 'totally', 'believable', 'great', 'comic', 'actress.Crucially', 'Coppola', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'dab', 'hand', 'creating', 'dreamy', 'landscapes', 'believable', 'relationships', 'subtly', 'complicated', 'characters', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'not', 'only', 'directed', 'also', 'wrote', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'promising', 'new', 'directors', 'Hollywood', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Just', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'are', 'lot', 'silent', 'shots', 'landscape', 'characters', 'staring', 'distance', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'much', 'shots', 'are', 'Johannsson', 'visiting', 'temples', 'watching', 'flower', 'arranging', 'provide', 'nice', 'counterpoint', 'humour', 'film', 'Japan', 'director', 'Bob', 'commercials', 'hilarious', 'Japanese', 'talk', 'show', 'LIT', 'achievement', 'best', 'sort', 'gently', 'humorous', 'beautiful', 'genuinely', 'touching']",Lost in Translation

No city in the world can compete with Tokyo in terms of nighttime lights and the fresh sparkly cleanliness of its streets. Add in the language barrier, the Japanese, their cuisine, great photography, great direction, great acting, and finally, a terrific script, and you have a masterpiece.Lost In Translation truly makes you feel lost---lost in time really. Sofia Coppola's use of the clock while filming native scenes accompanied only with ambient noise is a mighty tool of provoking deep thought in the viewer. Truly it must take guts to consume precious film with such shots, else more directors would utilize the method.No two better suited individuals than Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson could have been lobbied to fulfill the lead roles. Murray has like, somehow, escalated multiple levels here in connecting with an audience. Maybe he had it inside of him all along, I don't know. Regardless, I am nearly brought to tears watching him. Here's a fellow who is nearly 60 years old, and yet, the most amazing inner talent is just now being revealed to us. What a treasure.Ms. Johansson plays the perfect newlywed here---being left alone in a strange city by a self-absorbed husband who doesn't appreciate what he has. Charlotte and the middle-aged Bob Harris (Johannsson and Murray) happen to fall into each other's path at one of those cosmic moments of doubt when both are unhappy with their home life.The gold brick of this entire encounter is cast when they appear together lying on a bed. It must be seen and heard to believe; it is one of the finest performances of its kind ever filmed IMO---Hence the subject line of this review.

Sofia Coppola is a brilliant storyteller and has crafted a film with more warmth, heart and intelligence than most films out today.Casting Bill Murray in this role might be the best casting choice of 2003.  He is so wonderful as this character because, honestly, in many ways he is this character.  As Murray has aged we have seen less and less of him, and there was a point where it would have been very easy for him to cross the threshold into has-been or, worse, self-parody.  He did hold on, albeit not with the same superstar power he once held, and has managed to grow and mature into one of the best, most underrated actors of our day.  Who would have thought that would be possible? As for Scarlett Johansson, again with the great casting choice.  She has the freshness, vulnerability and energy to carry this off, yet such depth and maturity as well.  She is wise beyond her years and yet still so young, and a gifted actress.  There is chemistry beyond chemistry between these two and that's a big reason the film works, because with less talented or poorly matched actors we might be a bit turned-off by the age difference between them, yet I found myself wanting things to work out for them even when I knew it couldn't be.  And the fact that Coppola was honest and true to the characters she created instead of taking the easy way out speaks volumes of her integrity as an artist.  We have been conditioned to look for the happy ending, and our version of ""happy ending"" is ""happy ending in bed"".  But these are real people on the screen, with real lives and real consequences which they cannot forget about.  And their decision to remain true to the others in their lives, their understanding of the imposibility of their being together, is much more moving than any climactic (no pun intended) romp in bed could ever be.  The final scene alone speaks volumes, though nothing is really said between them.  But we know they understand each other, and we can see that it's enough for them.  So it becomes enough for us, if we're willing to cast aside our pre-conditioned notions of ""romance"" and remember that not everything we want is truly meant to be.Everything about this film is just so perfect.  Tokyo is bright, beautiful and exciting.  The dialogue is tremendous, most especially in the quiet, intimate conversations which are seemingly meaningless but are actually the meat of what makes the characters.  It takes greater talent to pull off a scene like that than a highly-charged emotional one.  And the message is so heartbreaking and beautiful....like Don Quixote said, ""to love pure and chaste from afar""....In this case, it's much more affective.",5,Sofia made the right choices!,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,2727,"['What', 'beautiful', 'thoughtful', 'sweet', 'movie', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'brilliant', 'storyteller', 'crafted', 'film', 'more', 'warmth', 'heart', 'intelligence', 'most', 'films', 'out', 'today.Casting', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'role', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'casting', 'choice', '2003', 'so', 'wonderful', 'character', 'honestly', 'many', 'ways', 'character', 'Murray', 'aged', 'have', 'seen', 'less', 'less', 'there', 'was', 'point', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'easy', 'cross', 'threshold', 'has-been', 'worse', 'self-parody', 'did', 'hold', 'not', 'same', 'superstar', 'power', 'once', 'held', 'managed', 'grow', 'mature', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'day', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'again', 'great', 'casting', 'choice', 'freshness', 'vulnerability', 'energy', 'carry', 'off', 'yet', 'such', 'depth', 'maturity', 'as', 'well', 'wise', 'years', 'yet', 'still', 'so', 'young', 'gifted', 'actress', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'two', 'big', 'reason', 'film', 'works', 'less', 'talented', 'poorly', 'matched', 'actors', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'turned-off', 'age', 'difference', 'yet', 'found', 'wanting', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'even', 'when', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'fact', 'Coppola', 'was', 'honest', 'true', 'characters', 'created', 'instead', 'taking', 'easy', 'way', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'integrity', 'artist', 'have', 'been', 'conditioned', 'look', 'happy', 'ending', 'version', 'happy', 'ending', 'happy', 'ending', 'bed', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'screen', 'real', 'lives', 'real', 'consequences', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'decision', 'remain', 'true', 'others', 'lives', 'understanding', 'imposibility', 'being', 'together', 'much', 'more', 'moving', 'climactic', 'pun', 'intended', 'romp', 'bed', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'final', 'scene', 'alone', 'volumes', 'nothing', 'really', 'said', 'know', 'understand', 'other', 'can', 'see', 'enough', 'enough', ""'re"", 'willing', 'cast', 'aside', 'pre-conditioned', 'notions', 'romance', 'remember', 'not', 'everything', 'want', 'truly', 'meant', 'be.Everything', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'perfect', 'Tokyo', 'bright', 'beautiful', 'exciting', 'dialogue', 'tremendous', 'most', 'especially', 'quiet', 'intimate', 'conversations', 'are', 'seemingly', 'meaningless', 'are', 'actually', 'meat', 'what', 'characters', 'greater', 'talent', 'pull', 'off', 'scene', 'highly-charged', 'emotional', 'one', 'message', 'so', 'heartbreaking', 'beautiful', '.like', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'said', 'love', 'pure', 'chaste', 'afar', 'case', 'much', 'more', 'affective']",Lost in Translation
619675,A1TUB7VSY2D82F,B00005JMJ4,"M. Starr ""Amneziak""","[4, 5]","Lost in Translation, Sofia Coppola's latest work, is without question one of the finer films of the year.  The stylistic transition from her last feature, The Virgin Suicides, to Lost in Translation is not exactly obvious, but nonetheless shows Coppola directing a more mature-natured picture than she previously has.  Lost in Translation's subtleties are its greatest achievements, while the actor's performances are the impressive allies to a compelling story of love, life, chemistry, and respect.  If at least one Oscar is not garnered from this combination of elements, I will find myself sadly disappointed.The movie begins with Bob Harris (Bill Murray) arriving in Tokyo, Japan to shoot a commercial for a Japanese-brand whisky.  Upon arriving in the country, it's immediately obvious that he is not completely up for this task.  He arrives at a beautiful hotel where he is lavishly welcomed by the hotel's staff before retreating to his room to alienate himself from the experience.  Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansson, is also at the hotel.  She is staying with her photographer husband while his is in the country for work.The next evening, Charlotte sees Bob having a less than fulfilling time in the hotel's lounge and sends him a drink.  Later that evening, they meet again in the lounge when both are unable to sleep.  An instant bond is established and the two slowly begin to realize that they are the best suited company for one another.Eventually Bob and Charlotte go out together on the town.  In the midst of being in a completely different culture, where more than the language is a barrier, the two find themselves meeting on a much deeper level than they had originally planned.  The fact that the age difference is obvious to the audience makes some of the subsequent scenes more intense.  You're left to question if the two are going to take the relationship to a sexual level.  You're left to question if the two are truly falling in love.  You're left to question if the age really has any bearing on the chemistry that they feel together.Therein lays the true beauty of this film.  Although it would be extremely easy to have these two romantically fall in love, they're simply two people that meet on an emotional level.  For lack of better words, they just understand each other.  For the next couple of days they utilize their time to the fullest by enjoying their time together.  They don't want the time to end, but realize that in just a few short days everything in their lives will go back to normal.During the last evening of the trip, a fire alarm is sounded in the hotel forcing everyone outside until all is clear.  At this point, Bob sees Charlotte and approaches her.  The moment is uncomfortable because, through no intention of his own, Charlotte becomes aware of the fact that Bob has unexpectedly had another woman in his room the night before.  Unable to deny the fact that she has become emotionally attached, Charlotte asks Bob when he is going home.  He replies, ""In the morning.""  At this point, it's in the open and the two realize just exactly how much fun they've had together over the course of their visit to Japan.  This is a friendship that could very easily be taken to the next level, but somehow the two are smart enough to understand that this is something that just needs remain where it's at.After leaving the hotel to catch his plane home, Bob sees Charlotte walking down the streets of Tokyo and implores the driver to pull over so he can say what he wanted to say earlier.  Unfortunately, and fortunately, we are unable to hear what he tells Charlotte.  We're only left to speculate what it is.  I'm sure most people agree that it can only be one or two things.  It's such a beautiful scene, though.  It's one of the true highlights of cinema in the past several years.Everything about Lost in Translation is in the right place.  As I stated before, it's the subtleties that make it so great.  Whether it's the witty humor of Murray, the innocence of Johansson, the brief appearances of the small handful of cast members, or the beautiful imagery of Tokyo, nothing has been overdone.Finally, as I left the theatre, I realized just exactly how much my emotions had been played with.  However, it wasn't until the second time I saw this film that I fully understood why.  On some level I guess I had wanted things to turn out differently, but maturity of the writing actually made this movie ten times more enjoyable than it would have been had it ended the way I wanted it to the first time.",5,Lost in Translation - Mise en Place,1067385600,"10 29, 2003",2003,4562,"['Lost', 'Translation', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'latest', 'work', 'question', 'one', 'finer', 'films', 'year', 'stylistic', 'transition', 'last', 'feature', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'not', 'exactly', 'obvious', 'nonetheless', 'Coppola', 'directing', 'more', 'mature-natured', 'picture', 'previously', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'subtleties', 'are', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'actor', 'performances', 'are', 'impressive', 'allies', 'compelling', 'story', 'love', 'life', 'chemistry', 'respect', 'least', 'one', 'Oscar', 'not', 'garnered', 'combination', 'elements', 'will', 'find', 'sadly', 'disappointed.The', 'movie', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'arriving', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'shoot', 'commercial', 'Japanese-brand', 'whisky', 'arriving', 'country', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'not', 'completely', 'task', 'beautiful', 'hotel', 'where', 'lavishly', 'welcomed', 'hotel', 'staff', 'retreating', 'room', 'alienate', 'experience', 'Charlotte', 'played', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'also', 'hotel', 'staying', 'photographer', 'husband', 'country', 'work.The', 'next', 'evening', 'Charlotte', 'Bob', 'having', 'less', 'fulfilling', 'time', 'hotel', 'lounge', 'drink', 'Later', 'evening', 'meet', 'again', 'lounge', 'when', 'are', 'unable', 'sleep', 'instant', 'bond', 'established', 'two', 'slowly', 'begin', 'realize', 'are', 'best', 'suited', 'company', 'one', 'another.Eventually', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'go', 'out', 'together', 'town', 'midst', 'being', 'completely', 'different', 'culture', 'where', 'more', 'language', 'barrier', 'two', 'find', 'meeting', 'much', 'deeper', 'level', 'had', 'originally', 'planned', 'fact', 'age', 'difference', 'obvious', 'audience', 'subsequent', 'scenes', 'more', 'intense', ""'re"", 'left', 'question', 'two', 'are', 'going', 'take', 'relationship', 'sexual', 'level', ""'re"", 'left', 'question', 'two', 'are', 'truly', 'falling', 'love', ""'re"", 'left', 'question', 'age', 'really', 'bearing', 'chemistry', 'feel', 'together.Therein', 'true', 'beauty', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'easy', 'have', 'two', 'romantically', 'fall', 'love', ""'re"", 'simply', 'two', 'people', 'meet', 'emotional', 'level', 'lack', 'better', 'words', 'just', 'understand', 'other', 'next', 'couple', 'days', 'utilize', 'time', 'fullest', 'enjoying', 'time', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'time', 'end', 'realize', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'days', 'everything', 'lives', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'normal.During', 'last', 'evening', 'trip', 'fire', 'alarm', 'sounded', 'hotel', 'forcing', 'everyone', 'clear', 'point', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'moment', 'uncomfortable', 'intention', 'own', 'Charlotte', 'aware', 'fact', 'Bob', 'unexpectedly', 'had', 'woman', 'room', 'night', 'Unable', 'deny', 'fact', 'become', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'Charlotte', 'Bob', 'when', 'going', 'home', 'morning', 'point', 'open', 'two', 'realize', 'just', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'had', 'together', 'course', 'visit', 'Japan', 'friendship', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'be', 'taken', 'next', 'level', 'somehow', 'two', 'are', 'smart', 'enough', 'understand', 'something', 'just', 'remain', 'where', 'at.After', 'leaving', 'hotel', 'catch', 'plane', 'home', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'walking', 'down', 'streets', 'Tokyo', 'driver', 'pull', 'over', 'can', 'say', 'what', 'wanted', 'say', 'earlier', 'Unfortunately', 'fortunately', 'are', 'unable', 'hear', 'what', 'Charlotte', ""'re"", 'only', 'left', 'speculate', 'what', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'agree', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'such', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'though', 'one', 'true', 'highlights', 'cinema', 'past', 'several', 'years.Everything', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'right', 'place', 'stated', 'subtleties', 'make', 'so', 'great', 'witty', 'humor', 'Murray', 'innocence', 'Johansson', 'brief', 'appearances', 'small', 'handful', 'cast', 'members', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'Tokyo', 'nothing', 'been', 'overdone.Finally', 'left', 'theatre', 'realized', 'just', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 'emotions', 'had', 'been', 'played', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'second', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'fully', 'understood', 'why', 'level', 'guess', 'had', 'wanted', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'differently', 'maturity', 'writing', 'actually', 'made', 'movie', 'times', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'ended', 'way', 'wanted', 'first', 'time']",Lost in Translation
619676,AT0E6UBVJMJ6W,B00005JMJ4,Ms Winston,"[4, 4]","In my opinion, 'Lost in Translation' was a movie that will be difficult for me to forget, due to the acting of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. This movie is the best work that the vastly underrated Mr Murray has done since &quot;Groundhog's Day,&quot; and I feel that Ms Johansson has a brilliant career ahead of her. True, in some ways this is a movie &quot;Seinfeld,&quot; a movie about nothing: two lonely people meet in a foreign city where neither of them speaks the language, both of them are having problems within their respective marriages. Murray's marriage is obviously in trouble, and Johansson's is eventually going to need CPR. They spend some time together, nothing really seems to happen, except that it becomes clear to the viewer that they are indeed that overworked word: &quot;soulmates.&quot;Sophia Cappola wisely resisted the temptation to allow these two to consumate their relationship, which would have changed the entire dynamic of the film. When they finally fell onto a bed, they ended up sleeping, with Murray tenderly holding Johansson's foot. To sleep in the presence of another person, and in this case someone you hardly know, is a brave act, an act of trust (thank you, Dianah Gabaldon, for pointing this fact out in your wonderful book &quot;Outlander,&quot; which is also the story of two soulmates). At the end of the film, Murray's character seems to have awakened from a long sleep, which is a life where he has spent years just going through the motions. What will happen to the character when he leaves Japan is pure conjecture on the part of the viewer: I like to think he went home and told his wife that they needed to put their marriage on the right track, and was willing to live with the consequences if she failed to understand him.I also particularly enjoyed the sequence at the beginning of the movie where Murray, looking like a burnt-out case, was filming the liquor commercial. A once big action star, his career had fallen so low that he was reduced to making commercials abroad. That he had virtually checked out of his life was evident, reinforced by him fleeing the hotel bar when he was recognized by two American fans. IMO it is a shame that Murray did not win an Oscar for this subtle performance. Ms Johansson turned in an intelligent performance of an intelligent young woman who seemed to have married too soon, and to someone who did not appear to be her intellectual equal, a young man superficial enough to be dazzled by a pretty air-head. It is difficult for me to believe that she was not nominated for an Oscar for either 'Lost in Translation' or 'The Girl with the Pearl Earring.'

I will tell you what the film illustrated for me- the feeling of being alone, despite (or perhaps because of) the nearby maddening crowd.  And it is a funny film; not stupid slapstick comedy, but genuinely funny in a realistic way. Several scenes left me smiling about them for days.Some viewers seem to have been surprised by the quality of Bill Murray's performance here.  While I do agree he was very convincing, I was not particularly surprised.  His character in this film actually seems to me as being similar to many of his other on-screen characters, only much more melancholy.  I attribute this to his maturing age, and maturing talent.And I will go ahead and heap on some more praise for Scarlett Johansson.  She has a low-key way about her, which I think is rare for such a young actress.  This kind of quiet dignity lends more credibility to her performances.  That said, her physical resemblance to Jodie Sweetin is striking.  When I first saw Ms. Johansson in The Horse Whisperer, I could have sworn it was Stephanie Tanner from Full House.Given the opportunity, I would happily watch this film again.

No such luck though, before I knew it, the credits were rolling, and with that, another hour and a half of my life down the drain.What a complete waste of time. It's a little love story of two people coming together in a foreign country, but since it has nothing interesting to tell, the movie goes nowhere, and there's no payoff. It reminded me of Garden State (which is still better than this) in the way I felt like I was watching two random people dealing with their little relationship and the movie putting them through their motions. I don't consider it entertainment to sit there and watch two people go on their little dates and smile, flirt, and giggle.Far as I'm concerned, here's the plot summary: two strangers meet, they get to know each other, they do stuff together, then sad, the end.The fact this movie takes place in Tokyo is really of no consequence. Provided that we still have our two main characters in a foreign country, this movie could've easily taken place in any other country and told the exact same story.

She ventures out, a little, mostly to places that seem familiar and urban. I realize Japan has its share of culture shock, but her attitude was a bit over the top.What is this? Jet lag? Didn't bring a guidebook? Instant homesickness? Maybe she's just a boring person.I think the reason that the Japanese like this movie so much is because it reflects THEIR attitude toward foreigners and foreign travel, e.g. - Don't get too involved and hang around the hotel where the other Japanese are. Also, with ""Japan as backdrop"" it's mostly non-judgemental about the country.After a couple of YEARS in Japan, (and a few vactions) I started acting a little like that and would retreat to the privacy of my apartment on a regular basis. The only reason I stayed for years was because I lucked out and got a job that had 5 months paid vacation time every year. But I only started turning into a hermit after a LONG TIME had passed, and the place was starting to get old.This was also one of the draggiest movies I'd seen for a while. With its Stanley Kubrick style plot timing, (SLOW) I can see why it drove some people nuts to watch it.I do realize that the reason for the relationship with Murray is her immature husband's emotional neglect, but the artsy-fartsy emphasis on visuals overwhelms the story line, and I found myself ""Lost in a Coma"" a number of times while watching it.I did like the way the relationship was handled - with a fair amount of sensitivity and more realism than a lot of hackneyed relationship flicks.

619684,A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1,B00005JMJ4,newfound32,"[2, 3]","""Lost in Translation"" is a powerful and insightful film about one of the most fundamental of personal inquiries purpose. In other words, it is a movie about soul searching. Virtually all of us, at some point in time, will ponder our place in this world asking who we are, what we are supposed to do, and with whom we are supposed to be. Most individuals likely do not have to struggle with this question, either because they do not care, or because they simply occupy themselves with the routine and mundane fascinations of daily life, ignoring the deeper and more troubling nature of their existence. For others, however, the question of purpose in life can be a haunting, even paralyzing, burden. For those individuals who have personally felt this weight, it feels as if you are lost in the world. You do not know who you are, where you are going, or what you want. You feel melancholy, listless, and numb. You are not amused by the small trappings of daily life, and you want nothing more than to break out of the routine, and find your way. But, because finding the way is so difficult, you often drown yourself in sorrow and doubt.Now, revealing these innermost thoughts is extremely difficult to do in a movie. At best, viewers are given small vignettes by a character's crying, their apathetic attitude, or, in rare instances, through dialogue where a character articulates their feelings in spoken word. ""Lost in Translation"" reveals the internal dilemma of the two main characters, who are both experiencing the feeling of being lost, by creating an analogy. The analogy is being in a foreign country, where the language, customs, mannerisms, and culture are vastly different from that which is familiar to you; for example, two Americans in modern-day Japan. A foreigner in such a position often does not understand where they are going, feel grossly out of place, and cannot take advantage of simple daily amusements. Stuck in such a situation, one might be tempted to simply stay in their hotel room, or lose themselves at the bar night after night. While not a perfect analogy, it is a visually intense way at revealing, albeit imperfectly, the feeling of an individual struggling with their place in the world.""Lost in Translation"" avoids any deep philosophical analysis of this problem. It does not give an answer to the character's questions. It does not provide any hidden meaning of life. It does not attempt to make sense out of the confusion of life that can consume us and rightfully so. For those that struggle with the question of purpose, an answer is rarely presented. Some may have an epiphany, finding themselves in a moment of clarity. Others are not so lucky. The question of purpose is fundamental, and, as revealed by the characters in this film, is often a life long inquiry facing us at the beginning of life (Charlotte) or in the middle of well-traveled life (Bob).What hope the film does provide is that we may find someone in life with whom we can share our experiences. This, in reality, is usually the best hope of all. We may never come to grasp with our struggle to find a place in the world. But by struggling together, it makes life bearable, and even, enjoyable. This is the relationship between Bob and Charlotte. It is not sexual. And it is not simply friendly. It is a deep connection a bond that allows them to overcome their melancholy, venturing through life together. Just as it is a far better experience for a foreigner to visit a foreign country with a friend. It is not that the two individuals combined have any better sense of direction or feel any less out of place. But they share the experience of being lost together relating and empathizing with each other, and depending on each other for support. A bond between two such lost souls is often more powerful than the disposable sexual relationships that permeate our culture today.""Lost in Translation"" does not attempt to answer the questions faced by the characters. It simply shows them, as best as can be done through cinema. The film may frustrate the audience, being that it is slow and meandering at times, ambiguous, and unresolved. This reveals the brilliance of its direction. The audience will feel what the characters themselves feel. This is the entire intention of the film. It highlights the frustration and disappointment that some feel in this world. It shows that even though there may be someone in this world with whom we could connect - sometimes that connection is not possible.Cinematically, this film is superb. Which is also very very funny. If you understand the purpose of the film, every aspect of direction contributes to the overall experience of sharing and understanding the sadness and confusion of the characters which is exactly what the two characters are doing for each other, sharing and understanding! Bill Murray does a fantastic portrayal of Bob. Only someone with his comedic skill could portray the sarcastic and subtle comedy of Bob's character. Scarlett Johansson is absolutely brilliant. She portrays the young, well-educated, but lost Charlotte without coming across as idealistic or portentous or philosophical-for-philosophy's sake. Her character is absolutely genuine, struggling with life even though she ostensibly has all those ""traditional"" indicia of happiness and success: a hansom husband, money, connection to fame, opportunities for world travel, and an Ivy League education. Bill Murry deserved the Oscar for this film though, he is hilarious. A must see film for everyone.",5,"funny, smart, widdy, and spectacular",1080432000,"03 28, 2004",2004,5544,"['Lost', 'Translation', 'powerful', 'insightful', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'fundamental',

This half-comedic take on it adds the twist of a foreign setting, Tokyo, Japan.  The man is Bob, an aging TV star flown into Japan to shoot a drink commercial.  The woman is Charlotte, a newlywed tagging along with her husband.  Charlotte and Bob meet each other by accident in a bar, and form a friendship while meandering thru the daylife and nightlife of Tokyo.  Both are married, yet neither is happy in their marriage.  Neither is willing to betray their marriage, so the movie is an extended play on foreplay and flirtation.I found this movie to be quite boring.  Bill Murray does seem past his prime, especially as a comedian, in this movie.  The dialogue between the two is realistic enough, though not that engaging.  And for a movie set in Tokyo, they could have used more famous sights as settings for different scenes.  Instead, much of the movie takes place in their hotel, or in malls, or restaurants, or other places that are quite similiar between the US and Japan.  The only worthy cinematography was the scene where they witness a Japanese couple on their wedding day.  Outside of that, the only memorable scene was Charlotte introduction, a shot of her butt in see-thru underwear to begin the movie.

But I will add that I saw this film when it first reached the theaters because The Virgin Suicides had convinced me of Sofia Coppola's brilliance as a director and because I was anxious to see a Bill Murray performance which had received such extraordinary critical acclaim.  I did not anticipate that when I left the theater that day, my heart would be aching from the whispered but almost unbearable tenderness of that ""grace note"" near the end to which Doug Thomas refers.  I went back five or six times before the film left town, and I bought the DVD the day it was released.  I am not condemning the views of those who do not respond to this film.  We respond according to the various ways in which our hearts are configured.  I know brilliant, sensitive music critics, for example, who simply cannot stand Mozart but love Wagner.  But if you are the kind of person who is fond of well-made, subtle, bittersweet love stories which move at a slow pace but build up astonishing power along the way, then you should at least consider watching Lost in Translation.

619692,A341BG8RMH8QW,B00005JMJ4,NotATameLion,"[4, 9]","Lost in Translation is a wonderful movie. It is a well put together, beautiful piece of art worthy of the praise it has received. It is also a ringing indictment of the world in which we find ourselves.Simply put--humanity, both collectively and as individuals, has a void which it is incapable of filling. We strive after multitudes of things to fill this gap--to block out, however temporarily the foreboding sense that there must be more to life. These things, be they products, people, jobs, or crusades for one issue or another, always fail to put an end to the void--to give us meaning.As time passes whole cultures are becoming frenetic in the energy they expend to try and narcoticize themselves to this fact of human reality. Things speed up. People disconnect from each other and abandon true community. We are satiated with the latest consumer goods and electronic gadgets.Lost in Translation is the story of two people struggling with the holes in their lives, the inhumanity of the cultures in which they live, and the wounds that they bear as a result.Charlotte and Bob (played brilliantly by Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray respectively) are two lost souls who find each other while being doubly ""lost"" in a foreign land. This at first sounds like the plot for a standard romantic comedy (especially with Murray involved), yet Lost in Translation, in its fiercely honest portrayal of the lonely brokenness of the human condition, transcends its genre.Though darkly comic in parts, Lost in Translation hits the nail on the head in dealing with humanity's proclivity for compromising everything to try and fill our emptiness (which only leaves us more empty). There are a thousand clich&eacute;d questions that this movie begs one to ask; not least of which is: `whether it is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?' (Not that anyone `loses' here...but that brings up another whole series of questions.)But what strikes me as pertinent here is that neither Charlotte nor Bob was happy before their relationship begins bringing up all these questions in the viewer's mind. Bob's marriage sucks. So does Charlotte's. However, one senses that even before this these characters were looking for greater meaning. Bob has fruitlessly sought fulfillment from his work. Charlotte studied philosophy and tried writing (which left her just as empty as Bob).Could it be that while we pity the plight of poor Charlotte and Bob that we are missing a wake-up call (or perhaps in this case wake-up curtains) of our own? The catalyst for Bob and Charlotte's misery in Lost in Translation is that they are together in a place they both see as foreign, over-stimulated and in many ways incomprehensible.Yet being lost and unhappy in a foreign land is nothing exceptional compared to how most of us live our daily lives. Bob and Charlotte could run off and live in New York with each other-though nothing would change. We, like Charlotte and Bob, know we are disconnected. We know we are lost. On top of it all, we are caught up in the imagination and lifestyle of lands created by people drowning in their own terrible voids of doubt and meaninglessness-people who never had the strength to swim.The greatest gift of Lost in Translation is that it shows `reality' for what it really is: a monumental lack of imagination and a false construct overlaying the possibility of a true life just waiting to be found.The truth of this movie, though perhaps only implied, is this:Not many of us are wise. Not many of us are strong. Yet when we grow still, when our struggles cease, there is a weakness stronger than our strength, foolishness wiser than our years. In the silence it lifts us up.I recommend this movie.",4,JUDGING &#65533;A MINDLESS HUMANITY OF DESPAIRING CONFORMITY&#65533;,1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,3730,"['Lost', 'Translation', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'art', 'worthy', 'praise', 'received', 'also', 'ringing', 'indictment', 'world', 'find', 'ourselves.Simply', 'put', 'humanity', 'collectively', 'individuals', 'void', 'incapable', 'filling', 'strive', 'multitudes', 'things', 'fill', 'gap', 'block', 'out', 'however', 'temporarily', 'foreboding', 'sense', 'must', 'be', 'more', 'life', 'things', 'be', 'products', 'people', 'jobs', 'crusades', 'one', 'issue', 'always', 'fail', 'put', 'end', 'void', 'give', 'meaning.As', 'time', 'passes', 'whole', 'cultures', 'are', 'becoming', 'frenetic', 'energy', 'expend', 'try', 'narcoticize', 'fact', 'human', 'reality', 'Things', 'speed', 'up', 'People', 'disconnect', 'other', 'abandon', 'true', 'community', 'are', 'satiated', 'latest', 'consumer', 'goods', 'electronic', 'gadgets.Lost', 'Translation', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'struggling', 'holes', 'lives', 'inhumanity', 'cultures', 'live', 'wounds', 'bear', 'result.Charlotte', 'Bob', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'respectively', 'are', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'who', 'find', 'other', 'being', 'doubly', 'lost', 'foreign', 'land', 'first', 'sounds', 'plot', 'standard', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'especially', 'Murray', 'involved', 'yet', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'fiercely', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'lonely', 'brokenness', 'human', 'condition', 'genre.Though', 'darkly', 'comic', 'parts', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'nail', 'head', 'dealing', 'humanity', 'proclivity', 'compromising', 'everything', 'try', 'fill', 'emptiness', 'only', 'more', 'empty', 'are', 'thousand', 'clich', 'eacute', 'questions', 'movie', 'one', 'ask', 'not', 'least', 'better', 'have', 'loved', 'lost', 'have', 'never', 'loved', 'Not', 'anyone', 'loses', 'here', 'up', 'whole', 'series', 'questions', 'what', 'pertinent', 'here', 'Charlotte', 'Bob', 'was', 'happy', 'relationship', 'bringing', 'up', 'questions', 'viewer', 'mind', 'Bob', 'marriage', 'sucks', 'So', 'Charlotte', 'However', 'one', 'even', 'characters', 'were', 'looking', 'greater', 'meaning', 'Bob', 'fruitlessly', 'sought', 'fulfillment', 'work', 'Charlotte', 'studied', 'philosophy', 'tried', 'writing', 'left', 'just', 'as', 'empty', 'Bob', '.Could', 'be', 'pity', 'plight', 'poor', 'Charlotte', 'Bob', 'are', 'missing', 'wake-up', 'call', 'perhaps', 'case', 'wake-up', 'curtains', 'own', 'catalyst', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'misery', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'are', 'together', 'place', 'see', 'foreign', 'over-stimulated', 'many', 'ways', 'incomprehensible.Yet', 'being', 'lost', 'unhappy', 'foreign', 'land', 'nothing', 'exceptional', 'compared', 'how', 'most', 'live', 'daily', 'lives', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'could', 'run', 'off', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'other-though', 'nothing', 'would', 'change', 'Charlotte', 'Bob', 'know', 'are', 'disconnected', 'know', 'are', 'lost', 'top', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'imagination', 'lifestyle', 'lands', 'created', 'people', 'drowning', 'own', 'terrible', 'voids', 'doubt', 'meaninglessness-people', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'strength', 'swim.The', 'greatest', 'gift', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'reality', 'what', 'really', 'monumental', 'lack', 'imagination', 'false', 'construct', 'overlaying', 'possibility', 'true', 'life', 'just', 'waiting', 'be', 'found.The', 'truth', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'only', 'implied', 'Not', 'many', 'are', 'wise', 'Not', 'many', 'are', 'strong', 'when', 'grow', 'still', 'when', 'struggles', 'cease', 'weakness', 'stronger', 'strength', 'foolishness', 'wiser', 'years', 'silence', 'up.I', 'recommend', 'movie']",Lost in Translation

619700,A13WA7OFJRQMOY,B00005JMJ4,Patricia B. Ross,"[1, 2]","I've never seen Murray in a film that was as poorly suited to his talent, perhaps because he is so comfortable with comedy. This sad movie was made sadder by the parody of the wasteful days people will spend trying to make money. His noble gestures with the young wife were somewhat unbelievable, and were made all the more admirable because of it. Both of their efforts to prevent getting together, however, left the viewer all the more interested in seeing that happen, since it appeared to be what might have made both of them feel connected to life. Although the sources of their anxiety was different, both suffered from the detachment that people often feel when they seek each other out in territory that is not quite familiar to them. It's sweet that they were able to become friends, but the audience wanted more. Had Murray used his energy (that wasn't displayed) to enjoy her company, and teach her to enjoy herself without having sex, it might have been the solution to the despair they both felt trapped in the situations they perceived, probably accurately, they were in. Obviously, as the more experienced person, that would have been more appropriate for Mr. Murray than for the inexperienced young woman. It surely wouldn't be realistic to have to come from her since she was not in the ""preferential position"" he had on location; besides, older men should expect to lead in such a situation, rather than to be ""entertained."" Elders generally have the responsibility for setting both the pace and the level of appropriate engagement. While he did tackle that problem, it was not without prompting, and considerable reservation on his part, almost as if it was so little value to him that it wasn't worth his time or effort. This is not exactly the ideal method of retaining ""fan power"" although she exhibited that initially until he came so morose that they were left with nothing more than peripheral observations that substituted for connection. Murray is capable of more, and has in the past given more to his artwork. Perhaps the right film hasn't come along, or perhaps he was somewhat burned out, as in jet lag. It was a disappointing performance, but could have been attributed to the strange ""twists"" of the film, a new female director's first try, I heard.

Bob struggles with what may be a mid life crisis and seems to mentally struggle with the emptiness and life questions that it brings on...Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) a recent graduate from Yale with a philosophy major and a recent newlywed has traveled to Tokyo with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) who is a celebrity photographer. John's work consumes him and as he travels all over Japan he leaves Charlotte in Tokyo and a feeling of neglect begins to set in. Charlotte has achieved all of her early goals of finishing school and getting married but she still doesn't really know who she is or what she wants. A disconnect begins to form between the intellectual Charlotte and the work driven John and his banal, self centered celebrity friends. Charlotte isn't sure where life is taking her and can't seem to find direction ...Charlotte and Bob meet and find a kindred spirit in one another and an unlikely friendship is formed...This was a great movie but is not going to be for everyone. ""Lost In Translation"" is a character driven movie and is not driven by a typical A to B plot. It is about watching each of the characters deal with their own emotional ups and downs and as a viewer you will either find a connection with what's happening on screen or be left thinking it was pretentious and wondering what it was all about.The Good: It was great to see Bill Murray take on something that is a little outside of his norm and succeed at it and a great performance by Scarlett Johansson as well. Anna Farris also has a small part in ""Lost"" as an actress who has just filmed a Matrix like movie and she nails her part and gives an excellent performance.This was great writing and directing by Sofia Coopola. The scenes and the way they were shot were great at letting the audience know what was going on with the characters.The score was perfect and with the combination of great directing and acting the emotions of the characters and their internal struggles were excellently conveyed.The Bad: Nothing memorable.Overall: ""Lost In Translation"" is definitely not for everyone. Don't look for steamy love scenes or action packed fights and don't come looking for slap stick comedy. ""Lost In Translation"" is a character driven movie about people in a living purgatory looking for something or someone that will lead them out.

619703,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B00005JMJ4,Paul McGrath,"[3, 7]","The problem with this movie is that it doesn't really know what it wants to say.  It is artfully done, however, with a lot of quiet, gentle touches, and it is very pretty to look at, so you're not supposed to notice.  But it takes no risks, and leaves you nothing to mull over when you walk out of the theater.  It's a bit of fluff--a pretty bit of fluff to be sure--but a bit of fluff nevertheless.  What is bizarre is that this beginner's piece has garnered so much solemn critical praise.Bill Murray plays an actor who is in Tokyo to take part in a commercial for some kind of booze.  He hates Tokyo, he hates Japan, and he hates the commercial he is doing.  From the telephone conversations he has with his wife and the faxes that are sent to him from his family, we are meant to realize that he doesn't particularly care about them either.  He's completely bored and cynical about everything, and he sits around in the hotel lounge in the evening listening to awful lounge music and drinking.  In the meantime, we are told that for this job he is making two million dollars, and he is accosted on several occasions by strangers who recognize him from the many film roles he played earlier in his career.  He is thankless for all that he has and for all that he has been able to do, and is an utterly unlikable, contemptible human being.So far, so good.  Undoubtedly, there are hundreds if not thousands of people like this in Hollywood, stewing in their juices because of some idiotic part they didn't get, or angry that they must travel to Japan or Australia for a publicity stunt they consider to be beneath their dignity.  Oh, how one yearns for a contemporary movie like this, one which satirically exposes the over-inflated ego and vapidity of the Hollywood star.But unfortunately, very early on, we realize that this is not going to be the case.  Instead we are meant to empathize with this Murray character.  We are supposed to feel sorry for him!  The Japanese really are goofy and buffoonish.  Their city really is a pinball machine, with neon electronica, videos and shallowness portrayed everywhere.  They don't understand English--the clods--no matter how condescendingly Mr. Murray tries to explain things to them.All of the jokes, few as they are, are made at the expense of the Japanese.  Murray is taller than them.  He looks at us bleakly over their heads.  They greet him every morning in an ingratiatingly polite manner.  He's bored.  He makes ugly jokes about their food, comparing it at one point to his new friend's bruise:  ""Black toe,"" he derisively orders.  They don't understand.  We're supposed to laugh.  How wonderful it would be for the Sushi chef to announce to him that he indeed understands English, and crack him over the head with a rolling pin.  But no.  The chef instead is an incomprehending, smiling moron, and the smirking Mr. Murray is oh so clever.So he meets this girl--freshly graduated from Yale, very pretty and improbably a philosophy major--who is just as lonely as he.  (Will Hollywood please stop trying to portray philosophy or math or science majors?  They can't.)  Her husband is a photographer and he's gone all the time, so one night she buys Mr. Murray--thirty years her senior--a drink, and they subsequently go out and do a few things together, and oh, how touching, they help to make each other feel a little less lonely.  They never have sex.  And that's the plot.But what in the world are we supposed to think about this?  That Japan is some sort of lost hell in which white people must cling to one another?  That beautiful young women far from home can be comforted by cynical, drunken old men?  Really, and seriously, what is the point?There is a moment or two when it appears that the director, Sofia Coppola, was trying for one.  There is a great scene in which Murray is playing golf, on a beautiful green course, alone, and with an incredible Mt. Fuji as a backdrop.  What a lucky guy, we think.  How can he be so unhappy?  But very quickly after we are again manipulated into believing that things truly are an awful nightmare for him, and that it is only his burgeoning relationship and his quirky sense of humor that are pulling him through.  Some nightmare.This basic contradiction is why the movie fails.  Why should we, the nine-to-five, slobbering, popcorn-fed public, feel sorry for this self-centered, pampered ass?So it misses, and misses badly.  It may be Murray, who is clearly out of his league, playing the role the same way he's played everything else:  the wise-cracking, likable, sardonic smart-aleck.  (How can he have been nominated for an Academy award for this?  He's done it forever and it is clearly out of place here.)  Or is it Coppola, who was unable to rein him in, or perhaps too inexperienced to have a firmer understanding of this subtle theme?Hard to tell.  It should be said, though, that this is not an awful or horrible movie.  Indeed, from a director so young, it shows a great deal of promise.  But to have been successful the film needed a director with far more maturity, or an actor with far, far more depth.",3,Promising Failure,1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,5120,"['problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'artfully', 'done', 'however', 'lot', 'quiet', 'gentle', 'touches', 'very', 'pretty', 'look', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'notice', 'risks', 'nothing', 'mull', 'over', 'when', 'walk', 'theater', 'bit', 'fluff', 'pretty', 'bit', 'fluff', 'be', 'sure', 'bit', 'fluff', 'nevertheless', 'What', 'bizarre', 'beginner', 'piece', 'garnered', 'so', 'much', 'solemn', 'critical', 'praise.Bill', 'Murray', 'actor', 'who', 'Tokyo', 'take', 'part', 'commercial', 'kind', 'booze', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'commercial', 'doing', 'telephone', 'conversations', 'wife', 'faxes', 'are', 'sent', 'family', 'are', 'meant', 'realize', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'completely', 'bored', 'cynical', 'everything', 'around', 'hotel', 'lounge', 'evening', 'listening', 'awful', 'lounge', 'music', 'drinking', 'meantime', 'are', 'told', 'job', 'making', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'accosted', 'several', 'occasions', 'strangers', 'who', 'recognize', 'many', 'film', 'roles', 'played', 'earlier', 'career', 'thankless', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'utterly', 'unlikable', 'contemptible', 'human', 'being.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'Undoubtedly', 'are', 'hundreds', 'not', 'thousands', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'stewing', 'juices', 'idiotic', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'angry', 'must', 'travel', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'publicity', 'stunt', 'consider', 'be', 'beneath', 'dignity', 'Oh', 'how', 'one', 'contemporary', 'movie', 'one', 'satirically', 'over-inflated', 'ego', 'vapidity', 'Hollywood', 'star.But', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'early', 'realize', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'case', 'Instead', 'are', 'meant', 'empathize', 'Murray', 'character', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Japanese', 'really', 'are', 'goofy', 'buffoonish', 'city', 'really', 'pinball', 'machine', 'neon', 'electronica', 'videos', 'shallowness', 'portrayed', 'everywhere', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'English', 'clods', 'matter', 'how', 'condescendingly', 'Mr.', 'Murray', 'explain', 'things', 'them.All', 'jokes', 'few', 'are', 'are', 'made', 'expense', 'Japanese', 'Murray', 'taller', 'bleakly', 'heads', 'greet', 'morning', 'ingratiatingly', 'polite', 'manner', 'bored', 'ugly', 'jokes', 'food', 'comparing', 'one', 'point', 'new', 'friend', 'bruise', 'Black', 'toe', 'derisively', 'orders', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'laugh', 'How', 'wonderful', 'would', 'be', 'Sushi', 'chef', 'announce', 'indeed', 'English', 'crack', 'head', 'rolling', 'pin', 'chef', 'instead', 'incomprehending', 'smiling', 'moron', 'smirking', 'Mr.', 'Murray', 'oh', 'so', 'clever.So', 'girl', 'freshly', 'graduated', 'Yale', 'very', 'pretty', 'improbably', 'philosophy', 'major', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'lonely', 'Will', 'Hollywood', 'please', 'stop', 'trying', 'portray', 'philosophy', 'math', 'science', 'majors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'husband', 'photographer', 'gone', 'time', 'so', 'one', 'night', 'Mr.', 'Murray', 'thirty', 'years', 'senior', 'drink', 'subsequently', 'go', 'out', 'do', 'few', 'things', 'together', 'oh', 'how', 'touching', 'help', 'make', 'other', 'feel', 'little', 'less', 'lonely', 'never', 'have', 'sex', 'plot.But', 'what', 'world', 'are', 'supposed', 'think', 'Japan', 'sort', 'lost', 'hell', 'white', 'people', 'must', 'cling', 'one', 'beautiful', 'young', 'women', 'far', 'home', 'can', 'be', 'comforted', 'cynical', 'drunken', 'old', 'men', 'Really', 'seriously', 'what', 'point', 'moment', 'two', 'when', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'was', 'trying', 'one', 'great', 'scene', 'Murray', 'playing', 'golf', 'beautiful', 'green', 'course', 'alone', 'incredible', 'Mt', 'Fuji', 'backdrop', 'What', 'lucky', 'guy', 'think', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'unhappy', 'very', 'quickly', 'are', 'again', 'manipulated', 'believing', 'things', 'truly', 'are', 'awful', 'nightmare', 'only', 'burgeoning', 'relationship', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', 'are', 'pulling', 'nightmare.This', 'basic', 'contradiction', 'why', 'movie', 'Why', 'should', 'nine-to-five', 'slobbering', 'popcorn-fed', 'public', 'feel', 'sorry', 'self-centered', 'pampered', 'ass', 'badly', 'may', 'be', 'Murray', 'who', 'clearly', 'league', 'playing', 'role', 'same', 'way', 'played', 'everything', 'else', 'wise-cracking', 'likable', 'sardonic', 'smart-aleck', 'How', 'can', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'award', 'done', 'forever', 'clearly', 'place', 'here', 'Coppola', 'who', 'was', 'unable', 'rein', 'perhaps', 'too', 'inexperienced', 'have', 'firmer', 'understanding', 'subtle', 'theme', 'Hard', 'tell', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'though', 'not', 'awful', 'horrible', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'director', 'so', 'young', 'great', 'deal', 'promise', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'film', 'needed', 'director', 'far', 'more', 'maturity', 'actor', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'depth']",Lost in Translation

But mine is not a universal opinion, as it&#65533;s easy to see from scrolling through these reviews. It&#65533;s a movie that kind of defies categorization: it&#65533;s not really a romance, it&#65533;s sure not an action thriller or a mystery or sci-fi or fantasy or horror. So what is it?I think Lost in Translation is a visual essay on the modern condition: disconnection from self, others, and ones surroundings. Here&#65533;s the setup: Bill Murray plays American middle-aged actor Bob Harris (a generic name, if ever there was one, prob standing in for Everyman), in Tokyo to film a commercial for Santori whiskey. He&#65533;s bored, horribly jetlagged, at sea with Japanese language and the accented attempts of the Japanese to speak English to him, lonely, and disaffected. And here&#65533;s one thing: I&#65533;ve never before seen a movie with Bill Murray in it that I liked to any degree whatsoever; all schlock. But he&#65533;s been underrated, I see now: he&#65533;s absolutely superb in Lost in Translation.Our man Bob keeps encountering another American (Scarlett Johansson, of Girl with the Pearl Earring fame), equally out of synch with the time zones, more or less abandoned by her photographer husband, and already, in her young life, feeling colossally alone.They strike up a relationship of sorts, and in spite of their obvious age difference, become soul mates forever &#65533; and there&#65533;s no sex.Amazingly done.

He pampered himself and he loved expensive clothes. One day he ordered 2 tailors to sew him new attire to show off to the whole kingdom, and if he is unhappy with the clothes, he will execute them. Running out of time, the 2 tailors became scared and when the Emperor summoned them, they came and showed the Emperor ""air"" and claimed it was a special robe which only intelligent people can see. Of course, no one could see anything there but they didn't want to be labelled as stupid. So, everyone from the Emperor to his ministers said that they could see it and mentioned how beautiful it was. At last, the Emperor marched naked across his kingdom.The reason I told that story is because I feel this movie is something like the clothes. There's nothing there, but people are making a big hoo-ha about it. Bare in mind though, it is not a particularly bad movie, but it isn't good either.The story is set in Tokyo, a city bustling with life and color. Bob Harris is a Hollywood has-been who is in Tokyo filming some commercials. During his stay, he is in frequent contact with his wife who seems to rely on him to make petty decisions like picking the correct marble color etc. Meanwhile, young ""just married"" Charlotte is also in Tokyo with her husband, John. John is a photographer and is rarely in the hotel. That leaves Charlotte feeling lonely. She does however notice Bob in the hotel many times, and so does Bob. A friendship is formed between the both of them as they share some weird moments together. And so the story progresses...I don't know, I tried to like this movie. I even watched it 3 times because I thought I missed something the first time I watched it. But it's just mediocre. I could barely sustain my interest in the movie. If it were half an hour longer, honestly I would've switched off my TV. I am someone very open-minded about movies and I even love artsy movies, but this movie does not offer anything special. The concept of the movie was interesting enough and as the movie was building up, I was waiting for something intelligent, something quirky, something different but unfortunately, it never came.Bill Murray was basically playing himself in this movie, though not at his best. He basically sulks around looking pathetic. Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte did a good job, she's a talented actress and I have much respect for her but unfortunately, she can just do as much as the script allows her to. The screenplay which was written by Sofia Coppola, seemed too dry for my taste. I love intelligent dialogue, witty humour and sometimes just plain facts presented in an entertaining way, none of which I felt present in this movie. It really was  a surprise for me when she took home the Oscar for this category.Well, as I said...this isn't a bad movie, but considering the attention and hype it got, suffice to say I was disappointed with it. In my opinion, it's an okay movie but just don't have high expectations of it. I wouldn't buy it, and to be honest I wouldn't even rent it.

These days, we have the privilege to catch a glimpse of how the movie got made, the scenes that ended up on the editing floor, the interviews with the cast & the production crew. Whilst this movie is great to watch, it doubles the fun to watch the additional features mentioned. Truth to be told, Sofia's effort is rather commendable for her second feature films. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; got made afterall due to participation of the most under-rated comedian and actor from Hollywood, Bill Murray. Sofia even cried in the interview as she's still gobsmacked by the fact that Bill entrusted her to be the helm of this movie. She got the inspiration to set the location in Tokyo after her change of career from acting. My personal opinion tells me that Scarlett Johanssen's character is a real-life depiction of Sofia herself. When Scarlett's character talked about her been stuck & not knowing where she's heading, Bill's character assured her that in the end, she would eventually find a path for herself. It wasn't that long ago that we heard about Sofia's seemingly lost sense of direction when she bombed been an actress. If you have been to Tokyo before, you would probably emphatise with the sleepless two. There are many big cities in this world but none is as crazy & as mad as Tokyo. The buzz, the sound, the culture-shock, the technos, it's distinctly Tokyo. All the cliches are there. What made &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; special is the mood that the movie is able to portray; the charismas of both main characters. This is a movie about two lost people in desolation, lonely people trapped in their cocoon of circumstances & in their own special ways, they finally regain their soul & realising what truly matters for them in life. Perhaps, in the end, they both parted ways but the truly wonderful memory and their stolen kisses shall linger on for as long as they live. Highly recommended.

These kind of movies are all about acting, and not about effects at all.""Lost in translation"" is a simple story, but different. It's a love-story without the usual Hollywood-score and drama there to spice it up.

The characters often do not speak, but instead are shown observing their often confusing foreign surroundings. while this may seem boring to some, it's a joy to watch for those patient enough to adjust to the extremely talented Sofia Coppola's style of storytelling.Shot in just 27 days on a small scale budget, &quot;Lost...&quot; is beautifully filmed, with the city of Tokyo and it's residents front and center in this quiet little film. But it's the unlikely love story that leaves the biggest impression. Bill Murray and Scarlet Johannson are an unlikely pair of Americans (she along with her photographer husband on an assignment, he as a slightly washed up actor pitching wiskey) who stumble upon each other, and when each suffers from insomnia, begin to explore the city together. The romance, is sweet and in keeping with the rest of the story...very subtle. And while the ending may leave you frustrated, you ultimately realize it was the only way it COULD have ended.Both Murray and Johannson do a fantastic job of bringing their characters to life. and Murray, especially in the last scenes of the film, is able to convey so much... with just a glance or a gesture.  It's an amazingly effecting performance, and definitely his best work to date.The extras found on the DVD are wonderful as well.

619714,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00005JMJ4,P Magnum,"[2, 6]","Bill Murray has been one of the most unappreciated actors in Hollywood.  Thought of for the goofball characters he created on Saturday Night Live and in such comedy classics as Caddyshack, Stripes &amp; Ghostbusters, his acting ability is overlooked.  But as he proved in those films and equally great turns in Ed Wood, Groundhog Day, Rushmore, Hamlet, Wild Things and others, the man can act.  In Lost In Translation, he gives a performance for the ages.  Mr. Murray plays Bob Harris a movie star who travels to Japan to make two million dollars for a whiskey ad campaign.  He is jet-lagged, has to deal with a director who doesn't speak English and struggle with the banality of his life.  While winding down in the hotel bar, he meets young Charlotte who is in Japan with her photographer husband.  She too is trying to come to grips with her life, but unlike Bob who is trying to revitalize his life, she is trying to find her direction in life.  Both us each other to escape the confines of the hotel and escape for a few nights out on the town.  They meet up with some Charlotte's friends and end up in a bizarre club and then singing karaoke.  This produces one of the film's most poignant moments when Bob sings Roxy Music's &quot;More Than This&quot;.  In the performance, you see Bob baring his soul to Charlotte.  The movie ends with Bob and Charlotte embracing on the streets of Tokyo and Bob getting back in his car driving to the airport.  Charlotte is played magnificently by Scarlett Johansson and she is almost the equal of Mr. Murray.  The brilliance of the film is in its quiet nature.  Sometimes the two companions don't speak but you know exactly what they are thinking through their expressions.  Mr. Murray conveys senses of fatigue, bemusement, wonderment, aggravation and exasperation all with out ever uttering a word.  It is these little nuances that turns his performance from simply great to a once in a lifetime achievement.  Director and writer Sofia Coppola has learned well from his famous father and she has crafted a subtle yet powerful and emotional film that is one of the best films of 2003.",5,Perfect Translation,1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,2129,"['Bill', 'Murray', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'unappreciated', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'Thought', 'goofball', 'characters', 'created', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'such', 'comedy', 'classics', 'Caddyshack', 'Stripes', 'amp', 'Ghostbusters', 'acting', 'ability', 'overlooked', 'proved', 'films', 'equally', 'great', 'turns', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Rushmore', 'Hamlet', 'Wild', 'Things', 'others', 'man', 'can', 'act', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'performance', 'ages', 'Mr.', 'Murray', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'Japan', 'make', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'whiskey', 'ad', 'campaign', 'jet-lagged', 'deal', 'director', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'struggle', 'banality', 'life', 'winding', 'down', 'hotel', 'bar', 'young', 'Charlotte', 'who', 'Japan', 'photographer', 'husband', 'too', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'life', 'Bob', 'who', 'trying', 'revitalize', 'life', 'trying', 'find', 'direction', 'life', 'other', 'escape', 'confines', 'hotel', 'escape', 'few', 'nights', 'out', 'town', 'meet', 'up', 'Charlotte', 'friends', 'end', 'up', 'bizarre', 'club', 'then', 'singing', 'karaoke', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'poignant', 'moments', 'when', 'Bob', 'Roxy', 'Music', 'quot', 'More', 'quot', 'performance', 'see', 'Bob', 'baring', 'soul', 'Charlotte', 'movie', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'embracing', 'streets', 'Tokyo', 'Bob', 'getting', 'back', 'car', 'driving', 'airport', 'Charlotte', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'almost', 'equal', 'Mr.', 'Murray', 'brilliance', 'film', 'quiet', 'nature', 'Sometimes', 'two', 'companions', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'expressions', 'Mr.', 'Murray', 'senses', 'fatigue', 'bemusement', 'wonderment', 'aggravation', 'exasperation', 'out', 'ever', 'uttering', 'word', 'little', 'nuances', 'performance', 'simply', 'great', 'once', 'lifetime', 'achievement', 'Director', 'writer', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'learned', 'well', 'famous', 'father', 'crafted', 'subtle', 'yet', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2003']",Lost in Translation

M Simon ""El Simon Asombroso""","[4, 7]","If you've ever been in a hotel in a strange city, lonely and unable to sleep, you will instantly identify with Bob Harris (Bill Murray), even though Harris is a well-heeled star and you probably are not. But don't go into this film expecting the plot to follow cliches. Harris is a prisoner in a 5-star palace, dealing with a difficult wife back home, and running into nubile, much younger Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). You'd expect she and Harris and to have a sexual liaison. They do not, and the plot and script avoid a dozen other cliches.Instead, the story takes Harris and Charlotte down unexpected Tokyo alleys while the two try and sort out their lives.This film is directed with an eye to a stylistic capture of the reality of modern Japan. Bolstered by impressive cinematography (especially lighting and camera angles), it keeps the viewer interested and engaged as Murray and Johansson deliver consummate performances. Indeed, this is by far Bill Murray's finest work.

619719,ADUD2B1M768W2,B00005JMJ4,Prof Positive,"[4, 24]","When a movie is sparse in humor, action, and storyline it is considered ""character driven"". Critics will always give movies like this one rave reviews. In my opinion they fear being considered unsophisticated if they call the movie what it really is; tedious, unoriginal, and boring.The ""comedy"" elements tend to fall into the following categories:1.Japanese people pronounce the ""L"" as ""R"" (Example: ""have a nice fright"". We've seen this bit done to death already right?)2.Someone says something long and involved in Japanese and the translator reduces it to a sentence or sentence fragment; clearly losing much of the meaning. (also not breaking any new ground here)3.Hollywood starlets can be so dumb and superficial.4.The dry wit and charm of Bill Murray (Bob). Example: Charlotte (Johansson) asks Bob (Murray) where her friends are. He says they are taking dancing lessons and gestures towards them. The camera cuts to show them focused on strippers.I enjoy the dry wit and charm of Bill Murray. He adds to every movie he is in, but this is far from his best work. There are many scenes of the two main characters discussing how bored, isolated, and unhappy they are in Japan. Then after a few tame nights out or at their hotel, Charlotte tells Bob they should never come back to Japan because it would never be as much fun. This line would have worked better if it had been delivered with a sarcastic tone. Two separate scenes of the two of them running out of a building and into the Japanese night are probably supposed to give the film a feel of excitement and energy. It doesn't play and shows a lack of imagination by the writers/director. Worse is the phony sounding phone conversation Bob has with his wife. He sounds like 15 year old as he excitedly tells her about the party he had gone to and the crazy music they were playing. I get it. His new relationship with his soul mate Charlotte has helped him recapture his youthful lust for life.The larger theme here seems to be that seemingly dissimilar people can learn a lot from each other and form a strong bond when circumstances bring them together. Such themes have been explored in far superior movies (such as ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop""). Most of those movies are probably too structured, entertaining, and geared towards young audiences for critics to heap the same praise on them though.If this is a movie about personal growth and discovery then it invites the question; ""in what way have the characters grown?"" Bob had an affair on his wife of 25 years with a random woman (not his new soul-mate Charlotte, but a karaoke singer he meets in a bar). Will he realize that he and his wife have grown apart to the point that divorce is the best option, and find a young woman who still has passion for life? Would this be considered growth?Charlotte has learned much about herself. She prefers the company of a man who is so independently wealthy that he doesn't need to work and can spend the entire day goofing off with her. Will she realize that her husband was never a good match for her and get divorced? Would this be considered growth?I give the movie 2 stars only because Bill Murray is charismatic and likeable as always.",2,The guise of sophisticated comedy,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,3218,"['When', 'movie', 'sparse', 'humor', 'action', 'storyline', 'considered', 'character', 'driven', 'Critics', 'will', 'always', 'give', 'movies', 'one', 'rave', 'reviews', 'opinion', 'fear', 'being', 'considered', 'unsophisticated', 'call', 'movie', 'what', 'really', 'tedious', 'unoriginal', 'boring.The', 'comedy', 'elements', 'tend', 'fall', 'following', 'categories:1.Japanese', 'people', 'pronounce', 'L', 'R', 'Example', 'have', 'nice', 'fright', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bit', 'done', 'death', 'already', 'right', '2.Someone', 'something', 'long', 'involved', 'Japanese', 'translator', 'sentence', 'sentence', 'fragment', 'clearly', 'losing', 'much', 'meaning', 'also', 'not', 'breaking', 'new', 'ground', 'here', '3.Hollywood', 'starlets', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'dumb', 'superficial.4.The', 'dry', 'wit', 'charm', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Bob', 'Example', 'Charlotte', 'Johansson', 'Bob', 'Murray', 'where', 'friends', 'are', 'are', 'taking', 'dancing', 'lessons', 'gestures', 'towards', 'camera', 'show', 'focused', 'strippers.I', 'enjoy', 'dry', 'wit', 'charm', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'movie', 'far', 'best', 'work', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'discussing', 'how', 'bored', 'isolated', 'unhappy', 'are', 'Japan', 'Then', 'few', 'tame', 'nights', 'out', 'hotel', 'Charlotte', 'Bob', 'should', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'Japan', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'line', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'delivered', 'sarcastic', 'tone', 'Two', 'separate', 'scenes', 'two', 'running', 'out', 'building', 'Japanese', 'night', 'are', 'probably', 'supposed', 'give', 'film', 'feel', 'excitement', 'energy', ""n't"", 'play', 'lack', 'imagination', 'writers/director', 'Worse', 'phony', 'sounding', 'phone', 'conversation', 'Bob', 'wife', '15', 'year', 'old', 'excitedly', 'party', 'had', 'gone', 'crazy', 'music', 'were', 'playing', 'get', 'new', 'relationship', 'soul', 'mate', 'Charlotte', 'helped', 'recapture', 'youthful', 'lust', 'life.The', 'larger', 'theme', 'here', 'be', 'seemingly', 'dissimilar', 'people', 'can', 'learn', 'lot', 'other', 'form', 'strong', 'bond', 'when', 'circumstances', 'bring', 'together', 'Such', 'themes', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'far', 'superior', 'movies', 'such', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'Most', 'movies', 'are', 'probably', 'too', 'structured', 'entertaining', 'geared', 'towards', 'young', 'audiences', 'critics', 'heap', 'same', 'praise', 'though.If', 'movie', 'personal', 'growth', 'discovery', 'then', 'question', 'what', 'way', 'have', 'characters', 'grown', 'Bob', 'had', 'affair', 'wife', '25', 'years', 'random', 'woman', 'not', 'new', 'soul-mate', 'Charlotte', 'karaoke', 'singer', 'bar', 'Will', 'realize', 'wife', 'have', 'grown', 'apart', 'point', 'divorce', 'best', 'option', 'find', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'still', 'passion', 'life', 'Would', 'be', 'considered', 'growth', 'Charlotte', 'learned', 'much', 'company', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'independently', 'wealthy', ""n't"", 'need', 'work', 'can', 'spend', 'entire', 'day', 'goofing', 'off', 'Will', 'realize', 'husband', 'was', 'never', 'good', 'match', 'get', 'divorced', 'Would', 'be', 'considered', 'growth', 'give', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'only', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'charismatic', 'likeable', 'always']",Lost in Translation

However, I really have no idea who this movie is trying to reach out to, and I also don't know anybody who might like this film.  I love it, but I guess the only way to keep this review fresh is to acknowledge and criticze the common remarks.  Here are my two cents.""This movie isn't about anything""---Very true, but it's not trying to be.  I know that's not a very appealing aspect, but for me that helps the movie.  I believe that life has a purpose, but I also admit that life is not spelled out like it is in epics or Shakespeare...or 99% of the movies I've ever seen.""This movie isn't funny.""---This movie isn't very funny.  That, sadly, is one of its faults.  I'm all for dry humor, but Bob Harris (played wonderfully by Bill Murray) is trying to limit his reputation as an actor, keeping things on the down-low.  Well, writer-director Sofia Coppola should've rethought that approach, because you can't aim for something with your characters and then expect the audience to react the exact opposite.  In other words, you can't make Bill Murray funny by making him desperately trying to be unfunny.  Nevertheless, I smiled and nodded at the movie's undeniable charm.""Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give the best performances of their career.""---Johansson was equally good in ""Girl With A Pearl Earring,"" but she's perfect here.  She's young, but intelligent.  She's lonely, but makes efforts to cope with that.  She's confused, but she learns that there's plenty of time left in her life.  As far as Murray goes, I prefer his comedic turns in ""Rushmore"" and ""Groundhog Day,"" but I will say that he perfectly captures the character of Bob Harris, and acheives what he tries to accomplish with this role.  Roger Ebert said it best ""Bill Murray is becoming the master of minimalist expressions.""""Sofia Coppola makes up for the bad acting in 'The Godfather: Part III'.""---I, for one, thought she was ""OKAY"" in that movie, but who cares?  She's behind the camera, and to me, she would've been my pick for the Best Director Of The Year (Oscars chose Peter Jackson...excellent alternative).  She did not go for an epic or grandiose feel.  She acheived what very movies do for me...I felt like I was actually there in the world of the characters.  I felt what Charlotte and Bob felt...which is a good thing and a bad thing.  When they were having fun, so was I.  When they were bored, Coppola captured that a little too well in a couple of scenes.  When Bob and Charlotte don't want to leave each, I didn't want the movie to end.""I'm glad that Bob and Charlotte don't have a passionate relationship, but an actual bond.""---I don't know who said it first or best, but I am in total agreement.  The last thing this movie needed was a sex scene.""The supporting characters are either underused, or unnecessary.""---This is one of those points where I understand the intention (they're supposed to be quirky and add flavor to the oddities of the Japanese culture), but again, it works too well.  To develop them would've hurt the movie, but the way they are isn't completely satisfactory.  This is a lesser-of-two-evils debate.""This movie is boring.""---I guess since a lot people have made this comment, I suppose my disagreement won't change their minds.  ""Lost In Translation"" is admittedly slow, but that's because the movie focuses on the week that Bob and Charlotte share with each other.  Sofia Coppola is patient with their scenes together - I can't back this up, but I think a lot of people are simply impatient viewers.""This movie was way too over-praised.""---I don't believe ""Lost In Translation"" is a masterpiece, but it is an excellent movie.  Even if this film isn't entertaining to everybody (nobody I know likes this movie!), can anyone deny that this movie is something unique?  Can't even the un-impressed audiences admit that Sofia Coppola tried to go for an emotional response that few filmmakers have attempted?  One thing I believe that nobody can deny about ""Lost In Translation"" is this: There has never been a more honest or believable film ever.

However, in view of the many super-negative reviews, I should clearly state that the movie came together in the final minute or two.  Had I not watched it to the end, I would not have has as positive reaction.  Indeed, the bulk of this movie is sheer boredom.  The writer and director want us to experience being in a lonely place (and boy do they suceed!).Haven't you ever spent a week one day, or a month one week, or a day one hour in a place where you just didn't fit in?  Whether it be at the height of your career or as a child in a room full of adults, there is a real sense of loneliness when you realize that you are truly and profoundly all alone in a crowd; no one to relate to, nothing to entertain you, nothing to distract you, and you don't have the power to get up and leave; you're stuck!  I know that I can think of a number of times that has happened to me and there is a lonliness and sadness unique to such an experience.  Now think of similar settings on whose several occassions, there WAS someone who, for that otherwise interminable moment in time, was someone who made the experience turn into an manageable one.  It wasn't any ""love at first sight"" experience, it wasn't a ""let's exchange phone numbers"" (or even just Christmas cards) experience, and certainly not a ""let's do this again"" experience.  It was a place you never should have been but with someone who made the experience bearable.  That's what I saw in ""Lost in Translation"".  Moments like that come and then they are gone.  ""Lost in Translation"" is a tribute to all the misplaced persons who found each other briefly and then moved on.  It is a beautiful movie with exactly the right ending.

619730,A2VXLLBBT7CL89,B00005JMJ4,"R. Bayerl ""Specialist in having fun""","[8, 10]","Sofia Coppola has brought Bill Murray to a role that thoroughly establishes him as a gentleman, when he must leave his family of 25 years to come to Tokyo on business.  He is received in a style at the Park Hyatt hotel that befits his fame as Bob Harris the movie star, and now the spokesman for SunTory Whiskey.  At the same time he declares for the camera that ""It's SunTory Time"", he is something of a disconnected insomniac, pacing around the suite and looking for something authentic.  Well, it's not long before he crosses paths with Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, just out of college, and doing her best to be the wife of an itinerant photographer (Giovanni Ribisi, memorable from his recent role in ""Boiler Room"")).  It is as if ""men and women CAN be friends"", to rebut Billy Crystal in Nora Ephron's pairing with Meg Ryan in ""When Harry Met Sally"".  In this case, the sex part really doesn't get in the way.  We see what is perhaps a lampoon of some of the goofiness in the Japanese popular media, but Bob is game, and manages to crack a few unobtrusive jokes to keep the Bill Murray legacy alive and indeed perfected.  Charlotte is transfixed by Bob, and wonders if he is in a mid-life crisis (""Have you bought your Porsche yet?""), but Bob just appreciates finding a friend who'll really listen to him.  For those who loved the ineffable Bill, ever since he declared that ""that's the fact, Jack"" in ""Stripes"", this film is an incredible treat.  We're talking Best Actor, without a doubt, on par with Jack Nicholson's final emergence in ""As Good as it Gets"".  It is as if Charlotte has found a kindly comfort in this unusual mentor, who is fully willing to go to some decadent parties and off-color attractions in a camouflage T-shirt turned inside-out.  It is strange, in a way, how Ribisi fades from the scene; it's as if he doesn't really care.  But Bob would probably be the first to congratulate him, as a lucky man who doesn't know what it is to have such a wife.  As the professional critics tend to observe, there's not a whole lot of compelling ""story"" to lead you along through this 105 minutes; it is as if Coppola has instead prepared some sort of magic lantern show, in which the viewer is simply shown one context after another in a very ""polite"" set of circumstances.  This accounts for my 4-star rating.  Bob Harris, though, is enough to keep you in your seat, and Bill Murray now has a local capstone on his cinematic legend as great as the spire of the 52-story hotel from whose windows he is found staring.  But then, all folks go on, and we see, in the end, two folks who simply lived for their moments, before proceeding on, as their soul's assignments said they must.  In this case, the generation gap has been a functional aid to an encounter that would not so readily have happened otherwise.",4,"Bill Murray finally shines, as the Star over Tokyo",1064448000,"09 25, 2003",2003,2825,"['Sofia', 'Coppola', 'brought', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'role', 'thoroughly', 'gentleman', 'when', 'must', 'leave', 'family', '25', 'years', 'come', 'Tokyo', 'business', 'received', 'style', 'Park', 'Hyatt', 'hotel', 'fame', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'movie', 'star', 'now', 'spokesman', 'SunTory', 'Whiskey', 'same', 'time', 'camera', 'SunTory', 'Time', 'something', 'disconnected', 'insomniac', 'pacing', 'suite', 'looking', 'something', 'authentic', 'Well', 'not', 'long', 'paths', 'Charlotte', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'just', 'college', 'doing', 'best', 'be', 'wife', 'itinerant', 'photographer', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'memorable', 'recent', 'role', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'men', 'women', 'CAN', 'be', 'friends', 'rebut', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'pairing', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'case', 'sex', 'part', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'see', 'what', 'perhaps', 'lampoon', 'goofiness', 'Japanese', 'popular', 'media', 'Bob', 'game', 'crack', 'few', 'unobtrusive', 'jokes', 'keep', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'legacy', 'alive', 'indeed', 'perfected', 'Charlotte', 'transfixed', 'Bob', 'wonders', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'Have', 'bought', 'Porsche', 'yet', 'Bob', 'just', 'finding', 'friend', 'who', ""'ll"", 'really', 'listen', 'who', 'loved', 'ineffable', 'Bill', 'ever', 'declared', 'fact', 'Jack', 'Stripes', 'film', 'incredible', 'treat', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Best', 'Actor', 'doubt', 'par', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'final', 'emergence', 'As', 'Good', 'Charlotte', 'found', 'kindly', 'comfort', 'unusual', 'mentor', 'who', 'fully', 'willing', 'go', 'decadent', 'parties', 'off-color', 'attractions', 'camouflage', 'T-shirt', 'turned', 'inside-out', 'strange', 'way', 'how', 'Ribisi', 'scene', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Bob', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'first', 'congratulate', 'lucky', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'have', 'wife', 'professional', 'critics', 'tend', 'observe', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'compelling', 'story', 'lead', 'along', '105', 'minutes', 'Coppola', 'instead', 'prepared', 'sort', 'magic', 'lantern', 'show', 'viewer', 'simply', 'shown', 'one', 'context', 'very', 'polite', 'set', 'circumstances', '4-star', 'rating', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'though', 'enough', 'keep', 'seat', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'now', 'local', 'capstone', 'cinematic', 'legend', 'as', 'great', 'spire', '52-story', 'hotel', 'windows', 'found', 'staring', 'then', 'folks', 'go', 'see', 'end', 'two', 'folks', 'who', 'simply', 'lived', 'moments', 'proceeding', 'soul', 'assignments', 'said', 'must', 'case', 'generation', 'gap', 'been', 'functional', 'aid', 'encounter', 'would', 'not', 'so', 'readily', 'have', 'happened', 'otherwise']",Lost in Translation

619734,A2DDDKF5NZMTFY,B00005JMJ4,Regina McMenamin,"[3, 3]","Mostly set in a luxurious, high-rise Tokyo hotel, LOST IN TRANSLATION tells the story of Charlotte and Bob Harris, two alienated Americans tourists who quietly struggle with culture shock, insomnia and loneliness.Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte a 22 year old, recent Yale grad whose hipster, photographer husband is too self-absorbed to provide real companionship. Bill Murray is Bob Harris, a fifty-something, has-been actor who has traveled to Japan to earn $2 million making liquor commercial.When the two meet in the hotel's lounge, they find more than a pleasant conversation.  In each other they find the kind of companionship and kindred spirit their own marriages lack.  Though their relationship is strictly platonic, it provides the intimacy, respect and genuine love that each craves.Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, LOST IN TRANSLATION is a magically atmospheric film that completely transforms the bright lights and excitement of a hectic, world-class Asian city.

619738,A2QM44SYXT2PTO,B00005JMJ4,"""rfbsupg""","[6, 17]","It was nice to see this movie. There we are, in Tokio with Bill Murray... This guy is one of the few good actors in Hollywood, a pit he has been so underestimated all these years! He has this thing that you just look and get engaged, what is essential for his role in this movie.I think people is so used to watch &quot;easy-to-see expect-an-unintelligent-audience soap-opera cheesy-and-popcorn good-guy-gets-good-girl&quot; sort of movies, that they get a bit confused with this one. And it's not a matter of watching this movie with an open mind... just sit, eat your popcorn (this isn't any problem), and try to think 2 minutes after watching it... (no, it isn't necessary make a long reflection)... Actually, you can skip thinking 2 minutes too...The very thing that I loved in this movie is that what everybody is expecting to happen at any time (sooner or later... probably later, in the end, as usual...) never happens...I hope I'm not spoiling things here... But the story is very simple... nice guy (Bill Murray) meets a nice girl whose husband lets her too much time alone... Besides, the nice guy is far from home and isn't getting nice conversations with his wife in the phone...Well, what does everybody expect to happen here? I'm not even say...The real spoiler might be that... it doesn't happen!And that's great that it doesn't happen... Seeing the trailer one can understand what this movie is really about...The guys don't speak japanese and need translators.. but they suddenly share something that doesn't need translation, which is friendship! And that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Just friendship.For people that think that they understand immediately the point of other people... I would say at this point.. You are wrong...No I'm not saying that just because this movie breaks with a cliche this automatically makes it better than the others. I'm not even saying that it's better than anything. I'm just saying this is a good movie, I enjoyed it, I hope you enjoy too, and you get an enriching experience as I did. What's nice in the movie is the interaction among the characters and how people simply can't avoid feeling unhappy just because they're passing some time bored or a bit lonely, and don't have a nice way to kill time or some nice company...The point here is: Bill Murray is married and have some children! He's passing for some kind of personal crisis, and his relationship is not wonderful, but it's no reason for him to get a divorce and begin another relationship, just because he's going  out with a nice young girl (that probably would turn out to be like his wife after some time engaged in a relationship with him...)Let us face the facts, no relationship is perfect and wonderful all the time. The truth is that one wouldn't be necessarily more happy just switching partners every time things are not so good and one meets another &quot;nice&quot; one... Of course, I'm not saying that one wouldn't want, if possible... Well... I hope you get my meaning here...The girl in the movie is just bored!She's not enjoying things, she doesn't like japanese tv, doesn't feel anything in a japanese church, doesn't comprehend (nor wants to understand) japanese culture, etc.. And his husband is leaving her too much time alone... That's her problem... She simply can't avoid the feeling that she's not as happy as she wanted to be... Besides, she's not even considering the hypothesis that she might be passing for a rich moment in her life.However, it doesn't mean that get involved with Bill Murray would make her life better, or make her more talented (other thing that she complains, that she's not very talented for her work...).That's it...

Don't watch this movie if you're even the slightest bit tired - it WILL put you to sleep. I kept waiting for something important, something relevant, or something even the slightest bit exciting to happen... and it never did. All the Oscar hype was pure insanity. Being a big Bill Murray fan, I HAD to see this movie. Murray has some classic movies on his resume - ""Ground Hog Day"", ""What About Bob?"", ""Caddyshack"", ""Rushmore"", etc... but by no means is this one of his best. I do not stand alone on Amazon (as of 10/18/07, there are 570 ""1"" star reviews). Bill Murray plays Bob Harris. Scarlette Johansson plays Charlotte. The movie focuses on these two sad lonely individuals on the other side of the world... in this case at the Park Hyatte Hotel in Tokyo. Bob Harris is making TV commercials for Suntory Whiskey. Charlotte had nothing else to do, so she followed her young photographer husband on a photo shoot. Giovanni Ribisi (as husband John) has a small role in the beginning and then he just disappears (what happened to him?). This movie is strictly about the dialogue between lonely Bob & Charlotte. There are some great shots of the city of Tokyo, a funny scene in a karaoke bar, and lots of boring talk and people staring out of windows. Other reviewers have said that ""Lost In Translation"" is heavy on atmosphere, light and mood. I'll give props to the guy holding the camera and the guy turning the lights on, but for me to sit and watch a movie... it has to be at least semi-interesting.

If you have read the reviews you know that Bill Murray is lost in Tokyo and connects with a much younger woman. At first I thought this was going to be another younger person - older person romance but it is not. It is about two people in a foriegn land finding a common need in each other. And thats about it. Nothing much happens other than a romp through Tokyo. But I watched it knowing I would be watching it again and if you are purchasing a DVD that is important. To me, anyway.I found the ending to be very satisfying, leaving me wondering how a woman as young a Sophia Coppola could get inside the head of a 50 year old male.

619741,A2U0ABMZK6XBVF,B00005JMJ4,"Richard A. Tucker ""Tucker at large""","[3, 5]","This film is not for everybody. The premise is not strange but it does have an exotic air to it. One reviewer here wrote something about it's lack of sensitivity towards Japan and the Japanese. I didn't see that. I saw a film about two displaced people who probably shouldn't have gone to Japan and I never was convinced that their take of the country was meant to be worldly or balanced. They were both their because of circumstances that led them there and their take was never meant to be some utopian ideal. The actor (Murray) was there because the money was too good (presumebly) to pass up. The young wife (Johanssen) was there to be with her new husband, and she did try to take in the culture and the sights. That they amused themselves in their boredom by making light of their circumstances is nothing more than a safety valved to compensate for their loneliness and apprehension about being in that alien place. As the film progressed they got out of their shells and had fun among the locals, and by the end there was no doubt that the memory of the experience would be a high mark among others which would sustain them as they continued in their lives. I really loved to see how this change came about as well as the sexless love affair that ensued (the lack of sexual intimacy put more weight into the affair making it seem somewhat more potent and on some levels more disturbing when regarding their marriage partners) within this setting of glittering towers, high tech commercial visual displays and little restaurants. The population, that was as varried as any metropolitan cities around the world, and despite the language barrier, were also the stars. The fact that Murray's character is uneasy and somewhat flippant toward his hosts is not because he's a creep. These people are just as shallow as handlers on the other side of the Pacific and my guess is that he's disappointed with that realization. I can understand that. How often are Hollywood and advertisement folks painted with a broad brush in the USA? I never hear anyone complain of that treatment. It's the character growth in this film that makes me like them despite knowing very little about them. I've been in strange places with a language barrier and it's often not very pleasant but eventually you get out, meet the strangers, eat their food, drink their beverages and do that weird pantomime with hand gestures and facial expressions, and, if you're smart, a well placed local greeting, and things are no longer very strange.One word of caution. Just because the critics like something, or, heck, even your best friend, that is no indication of whether you will like the film. Don't blame the film because you didn't like it. Their intention is to entertain people and not rob them of their hard earned cash. Next time pay attention to the previews (most filmmakers have very little say about how a film is marketed) and really read those critics' reviews and from a few sources not just one or two. For more than a few people who've reviewed this film I get the impression that they bought into the hype rather than made good individual choices.Never, never buy into the hype. While I like (putting it mildly) this film, I can't see why it was as popular as it was. It's not that kind of film. The last time I saw this happen was with ""American Beauty"". Another great film but not one that was a crowd pleaser. Both of these films are too layered and subtle to be popular. The viewing audience is not at fault for liking or disliking this film, but neither are the filmmakers.

It's a simple story:  two discontented souls with massive jet-lag, and big relationship issues, meet by happenstance in Tokyo, and provide comfort to one-another.Within the simplicity Ms. Coppola nails jet-lag, ennui, relationship discontent, and Americans abroad with a gentle, humorous, and deft touch.  She also gets the attraction of age for youth, and vice versa, but keeps it grounded in how things could really happen, rather than slipping into middle-age fantasy.All the performances work.

The movie came out in 2003, in the fall, and I remember many folks treating it as a big deal at the time. Well, I did enjoy the movie, but not in that ""big deal"" way. It's an artsy movie that I would best classify as a set piece. You could go with the ""often brilliantly executed artistic or literary work characterized by a formal pattern"" definition, or the ""situation, activity, or speech planned beforehand and carried out according to a prescribed pattern or formula"" definition...either way, ""set piece"" is an accurate description of a movie which is so dependent on character and setting, and not so much on plot. Tokyo acts as a crucible by which Bob and Charlotte get to know each other, and they each experience epiphanies as to the nature of their current relationships, but in the end nothing in either of the lives truly changes. Their time together is sweet, and it is nice to watch their relationship grow, and you are left with the impression that they ""will always have Tokyo"".The movie reminded me a bit of the work of James Joyce. I know many are big fans of his work, but others, like myself, consider Joyce to be the ""Catastrophe of 20th Century Literature"". I would characterize his work the same way I characterize this movie: set pieces, with plot subsumed beneath character and setting, with epiphanies replacing climax and with little in the way of thematic structure and thrust. Don't get me wrong, I'm not equating the movie to Joyce...I'm just trying to illustrate my meaning.Bill Murray turns in a good performance...a believable portrayal of an aging actor. Scarlett Johannson does a good job as well. However, neither actor has to stretch in their roles...that's not the point of this style of movie. Bill Murray's best work, in my opinion, still has to be Groundhog Day. The movie was shot on location in Tokyo, and I recognized many places I'd passed through on my trips to that city.So, it's an enjoyable movie, but I guess I'm a bigger fan of more plot-driven movies, with a climax to the story.

619745,A2PPTN3DTD8QNW,B00005JMJ4,Rich Grace,"[5, 6]","I found this movie to deserve most of the critical hype it's received. This is unusual; critical raves usually leave me cold. Perhaps the finest touch in Coppola's screenplay and direction is that her characters don't emote at each other. I think a lot of viewers here are put off by that; for my part, I found her dialogue and her characters' reactions to various things going on in their lives to be absolutely accurate. Reactions, expressions and the gradual warming to each other of the two unlikely main characters are completely plausible (unlike, for example, the revolting characters in The Hours, another critical fave). If you're looking for excitement, this is not the place to go.Bill Murray's character is a man who clearly enjoyed earlier parts of his life but is gripped by tremendous late-middle-age ennui. The source of this appears to be his marriage, to a wife whom he once loved but whom he now apparently and somewhat harshly sees as a materialistic scrub. He does not have a lot of juice left. Scarlett's character is nothing BUT juice; her problem is twofold. First, her husband doesn't pay enough attention to her. Second, she does not play ball with her husband's business contacts, which is not a particularly good practice and results in her spending a lot of miserable days in a sterile Japanese hotel room. The bulk of the movie consists of these two flawed characters' efforts to work around their respective mismatched relationships to find something truer and finer, while locked in the surreal environment of the Tokyo Ginza.Perhaps the finest moment comes at the end, when Murray realizes that there is no way he could ever maintain a relationship with this girl, but also appreciates the way in which she gave him a spark of energy that he thought he had lost forever. Again, no hysterics or melodrama; his final statement to her is whispered into her ear and you cannot know what it was he said unless you're practiced as a lip-reader. A very good touch to conclude this film which never insults the viewers' intelligence.",5,"A microcosm, but rings true in every aspect",1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,2058,"['found', 'movie', 'deserve', 'most', 'critical', 'hype', 'received', 'unusual', 'critical', 'raves', 'usually', 'leave', 'cold', 'Perhaps', 'finest', 'touch', 'Coppola', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'emote', 'other', 'think', 'lot', 'viewers', 'here', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'part', 'found', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'reactions', 'various', 'things', 'going', 'lives', 'be', 'absolutely', 'accurate', 'Reactions', 'expressions', 'gradual', 'warming', 'other', 'two', 'unlikely', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'plausible', 'example', 'revolting', 'characters', 'Hours', 'critical', 'fave', ""'re"", 'looking', 'excitement', 'not', 'place', 'go.Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'clearly', 'enjoyed', 'earlier', 'parts', 'life', 'gripped', 'tremendous', 'late-middle-age', 'ennui', 'source', 'be', 'marriage', 'wife', 'whom', 'once', 'loved', 'whom', 'now', 'apparently', 'somewhat', 'harshly', 'sees', 'materialistic', 'scrub', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'juice', 'left', 'Scarlett', 'character', 'nothing', 'BUT', 'juice', 'problem', 'twofold', 'First', 'husband', ""n't"", 'pay', 'enough', 'attention', 'Second', 'not', 'play', 'ball', 'husband', 'business', 'contacts', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'practice', 'results', 'spending', 'lot', 'miserable', 'days', 'sterile', 'Japanese', 'hotel', 'room', 'bulk', 'movie', 'two', 'flawed', 'characters', 'efforts', 'work', 'around', 'respective', 'mismatched', 'relationships', 'find', 'something', 'truer', 'finer', 'locked', 'surreal', 'environment', 'Tokyo', 'Ginza.Perhaps', 'finest', 'moment', 'end', 'when', 'Murray', 'way', 'could', 'ever', 'maintain', 'relationship', 'girl', 'also', 'way', 'gave', 'spark', 'energy', 'thought', 'had', 'lost', 'forever', 'Again', 'hysterics', 'melodrama', 'final', 'statement', 'whispered', 'ear', 'can', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'said', ""'re"", 'practiced', 'lip-reader', 'very', 'good', 'touch', 'conclude', 'film', 'never', 'insults', 'viewers', 'intelligence']",Lost in Translation

Going into it, I suspected there would not be any gratuitous physical relationship between the main characters defined by an older Bill Murray and a far, far younger Scarlett Johannson simply because the notion would prove outrageous even by today's cultural standards. As movie craft, the only continuity in this film is established in the beginning when Bill Murray arrives in Tokyo for a brief acting gig and at the end of the film when he prepares for his departure. If every other scene filmed were represented as a playing card, any film editor in the world could reshuffle the deck, turn the cards over and come up with the same random film.  Shots of Murray sitting in a bar.  Shots of Johannson looking out a window. Shots of both talking on the phone. Shots of a brilliantly lighted techno-neon Tokyo. Shots of colorful fast talking Japanese personalities expressing themselves in a manner generally incoherent to the average Westerner. Shots of Murray and Johansson talking to or at one another, and mostly wistfully at that. Both characters have issues of loneliness and that's all they have in common, except that they are wealthy enough to share the same upscale hotel experience while staying in Tokyo. Sorry Sophia, this flick to me was akin to a highly praised abstract painting and proved just a bit too artsy for my unsophisticated midwestern sensibilities to absorb or fully appreciate.",2,I'm lost......translation puhleez!,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,1455,"['Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'buzz', 'Going', 'suspected', 'there', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'gratuitous', 'physical', 'relationship', 'main', 'characters', 'defined', 'older', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'far', 'far', 'younger', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'simply', 'notion', 'would', 'prove', 'outrageous', 'even', 'today', 'cultural', 'standards', 'movie', 'craft', 'only', 'continuity', 'film', 'established', 'beginning', 'when', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Tokyo', 'brief', 'acting', 'gig', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'departure', 'other', 'scene', 'filmed', 'were', 'represented', 'playing', 'card', 'film', 'editor', 'world', 'could', 'reshuffle', 'deck', 'turn', 'cards', 'come', 'up', 'same', 'random', 'film', 'Shots', 'Murray', 'sitting', 'bar', 'Shots', 'Johannson', 'looking', 'out', 'window', 'Shots', 'talking', 'phone', 'Shots', 'brilliantly', 'lighted', 'techno-neon', 'Tokyo', 'Shots', 'colorful', 'fast', 'talking', 'Japanese', 'personalities', 'expressing', 'manner', 'generally', 'incoherent', 'average', 'Westerner', 'Shots', 'Murray', 'Johansson', 'talking', 'one', 'mostly', 'wistfully', 'characters', 'have', 'issues', 'loneliness', 'have', 'common', 'are', 'wealthy', 'enough', 'share', 'same', 'upscale', 'hotel', 'experience', 'staying', 'Tokyo', 'Sorry', 'Sophia', 'flick', 'was', 'akin', 'highly', 'praised', 'abstract', 'painting', 'proved', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'artsy', 'unsophisticated', 'midwestern', 'sensibilities', 'absorb', 'fully', 'appreciate']",Lost in Translation
619748,AFKMK18ZXRU0Q,B00005JMJ4,"Rick V ""Rikity""","[1, 1]","I can't help but wonder how parallel the main character Bob Harris is with the real life Bill Murray?  My favorite Murray works are Caddyshack, Groundhog Day, Ghostbusters, Stripes, What about Bob? and Scrooged.  He has also had a showing in a few dramas as well so he didn't struggle in this type of role like Jim Carey seems to, or does Carey just seem out of place?  This film is a splendid mix between comedy and drama yielding a refreshing balance between too corny and an intense love story leaving you still awake and sometimes laughing aloud.  The thing that I really liked about the casting is the choice of supporting actress Scarlett Johanson as Charlotte, who emanates a more natural than constructed beauty that is the mainstay among many of the current wafer thin marquee actresses of late.To me this picture makes a number of underlying statements, without making this review too verbose I just want to share the two I thought most important:Does the institution of marriage make any sense?  Many people get married for all the wrong reasons or grow apart as the years go by.  Bob Harris is a middle aged man who's been married for many years and its been going downhill since day one, Charlotte just got married to photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) and it is already seeming like a bad decision since he never has time for her.  Both characters seem to yearn to embrace the other, tossing aside the whole point of marriage in exchange for infidelity.How different other cultures are from ours (USA) and the degree of difference one person can make in the life of another.  Tokyo should be one of the most exciting places in the world to go. Yet to the two solitude characters, are surrounded by millions of people but no matter how much of the American culture that has been integrated in to Japanese mainstay (advertising, red headed Caucasian singer in the bar, Levis, etc.) the people are still so much different and even harder to communicate with if you don't speak the native language.  It's so easy to be in some of the greatest places in the world yet have a horrible time, I have managed to do it before and found myself in the same position as Bob Harris did on more than one occasion.

If you've ever encountered someone special in your life, you'll most likely relate to the bond you feel with someone in the face of adversity or loneliness.That's why I can't believe the absolutely dopey reviews to this movie about boredom.  Can't people watch a movie without the couple jumping into bed immediately or the bangs of explosions?

I'm not terribly sure why; I didn't find it slow at all (and I get bored easy when I've sat though two slow films in two days, as I had before turning this on).The movie is the story of two American outcasts stuck in Tokyo, a fiftysomething actor (Bill Murray) in town to do an endorsement and the twentysomething wife (Best Actress Oscar nominee Scarlett Johansson) of a fashion photographer (The Gift's Giovanni Ribisi) in town to shoot a rock band. The two of them bond.Which does, okay, sound slow. But Coppola keeps it moving by having the bonding bounce back and forth off the vagaries of Japanese culture and how incredibly different it is from American culture. Underneath all the marveling at the differences that they (and we) do, Coppola is subverting the Hollywood love story. Basically, there are two ways that people fall in love: the real way and the Hollywood way. Coppola gives us the former, and then further undermines the system as the movie progresses. Ultimately, the movie is both frustrating and fulfilling; none of the cliches one expects from a love story are at all in evidence, none of the shortcuts, none of the triggers we associate with what happens between a man and a woman in a Hollywood film.Better than her debut, The Virgin Suicides.

619758,A38G64S5VMRI1P,B00005JMJ4,Robert Graves,"[2, 3]","Not even Bill Murray could save this one. Since watching LIT I've been trying to find a redeeming quality. I have two. First, the acting. Both Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson were good, especially when you consider what they were given to work with. Second, the movie eventually ended, and that may be its strongest point.Lost In Translation is the sort of movie that makes you work to watch it. Every scene is so underwhelmingly insignificant it leaves you thinking, 'That scene was pointless...but maybe that was supposed to be the point...so then why I am watching it?' And by then it's halfway through the next scene and well...you get the point. Three out of five scenes could have been removed from LIT and you'd have the same film.Bob (Bill Murray) is a once famous American actor who is still popular in Japan. He's there doing ads for a whiskey company, and he meets Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson) who's staying in the same hotel with her husband (Giovanni Ribisi), a busy and vacant photographer with whom she has so little chemistry you're left wondering how they ever managed to meet, let alone get married.After about 45 minutes of the cinematic equivalent of Volkswagen commercials, Bob and Charlotte sense their mutual misery and become buddies. At first it's low key, but when Charlotte's husband packs up to leave town for a few days, whoa-ho! Buckle your seat-belts because...well, no. Still nothing really happens. Bob and Charlotte take little day trips all over Japan and I think it's safe to assume that something's happening, but we can't be sure because Coppola never shows us. In her attempt to reach the apex of dramatic understatement we are repeatedly shown what appears to be a) the beginning of a scene, b) the middle of a scene, or c) the end of a scene. As a result we never really know where the relationship is. The characters are thus weakened and so is the power of the relationship- but wait; I thought this was supposed to be a character/relationship driven movie? Uh-oh.Then, in what is the penultimate dramatic scene of the film, Bob and Charlotte are lying in a bed late at night and he reveals the staggering, revolutionary news that life and marriage can be hard, and then he touches her foot.Here's bottom line: Coppola tried to tell us a story by method of understatement - by showing us exclusively the details of the story - but she showed us all the wrong details. For example, take the scene I mentioned above. How does Coppola end it? Fade out. There they are, on a bed late at night, just having had an intense discussion, Bob made some physical contact...black screen.HOW did that actual, 'real life' scene end? *That's* what defines character and relationships. Did they sleep together or just next to each other? Did Bob carry her up to her room? Did they wake up and have an awkward moment? It's *those* details that Coppola left out and instead chose to show Bob and Charlotte showing up at a bar they didn't realize was a strip bar - and then leaving. Bob slowly teeing up a golf ball, and then hitting it. Charlotte stubbing her toe. Bob having a bizarre encounter with a Japanese masseuse. In other words, absolute nothingness wrapped up in a costume of Coppola's artistic license. This is why we have to work so hard to understand this relationship - because we're always trying to figure out what's happened since the last scene. I'm sure lovers of this film would criticize me for not being 'patient with it,' or 'needing to have everything spelled out.' Untrue. Carefully add up all the excruciating details and busywork in LIT and it still amounts to very little.So what then is our reward? A peek into the twisted morality of Sophia Coppola. Everything in LIT points to Bob and Charlotte's relationship being a beautiful, misunderstood thing. But let's really look at it. A young couple, married only a year or two - the woman is struggling with her identity as her husband's career takes off. (This is called 'life.' Welcome.) And an actor, always traveling, having problems with his wife of 25 years. (Maybe because he's always away while she's alone trying to raise a family.) So the actor and the confused young woman meet and internally assume that if only they were together in a different world, all their problems would blow away with the wind.Apparently in Coppola's mind this is a natural, sweet, beautiful occurrence. There is nothing sweet and beautiful about this film - even if it had been done well, which it wasn't, it was still a story about emotional infidelity in two marriages.And then there's Japan. Look, I've never been there nor have I ever been particularly interested in the nation, but I was insulted for the Japanese after seeing LIT. Coppola chose to exclusively show the outlandish 'weird-game-show' side of Japan. Lesson learned courtesy of Coppola? The Japanese are short, strange people who talk funny, and a week in hell would be better than a day in that bizarre God-forsaken country. Just about every cliched piece of Japanese 'humor' was crammed into LIT, and not once was it funny watching Bill Murray trying to understand Japanese, especially not after seeing it 8 times in 90 minutes. Yes, I understand that she's trying to use it as symbolism for two people trapped in a strange land who only understand each other...yawn. Very 'Screenwriting 101'-ish.This is a poorly told story that ineffectively tries to convey a very poor message. And I went to this movie *wanting* to like it. Just go rent Stripes and The Godfather; you'll be much more satisfied seeing LIT's star (Murray) at his best and seeing LIT's reason for existing (Francis Ford Coppola) than seeing LIT

Its grotesque parody of Japanese culture - a true delight to anyone who knows Japan - is without question a bull's-eye:  having lived in Japan, I can say that the place really does at times appear to you the way that it does to the visitors.  Coppola gets Japan, or at least Tokyo, in what I found to be a unique yet tasteful way.  THe chemistry between Murray and Johansson is also extremely believable:  two strangers in their own life crises meet in a hotel and strike up a sudden intimacy, feeling like soulmates is their splendidly luxurious isolation and cultural alienation.  Finally, the acting is positively excellent, particularly Johansson, who comes off as something of a dowdy intellectual, confronted by a stalled marriage and broken identity.  But Murray is great, too, as a film star whose life is moving too fast as his wife pulls away from him while controlling the nest of kids at home.That being said, the way that some people heap praise on this film as if it were by Bergman goes a bit far.  Sure, they achieve a kind of immediate intimacy and openness, but these things happen when you travel and then they evaporate just as quickly.

619761,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JMJ4,Robert Moore,"[15, 19]","For the past few years, I have been concerned that Bill Murray, who has long been one of my favorite performers, had been relegated by Hollywood exclusively to supporting parts.  After a string of wonderful box office films in the eighties and very early nineties, Murray had settled into playing largely supporting parts in a variety of smaller films, with Wes Anderson's RUSHMORE a major exception.  This film, however, is a return to leading man status for Murray, and he makes the most of a great part.Murray plays American movie star Bob Harris, in Tokyo to make print and television ads for a Japanese brand of whiskey for $2 million.  We are simultaneously introduced to Charlotte, the young, intellectual, pretty, and profoundly disoriented wife of John, a freelance show business photographer in Japan to do a series of photo shoots.  Both are alienated from everything around them, unhappy in their marriages, unable to connect to the culture around them, and sleepless.  One night both of them go to the bar rather than lay in bed awake, and they instantly click on some level.  They spend the rest of their time together in Tokyo together (Charlotte's husband is out on an extended shoot), and they each discover in the other someone they enjoy, can confide in, and trust.  Is it a love affair?  A deep friendship?  The beauty of the film is that we don't know.  But we do get to witness two people, one famous and one unknown, one middle-aged and the other very young, connect on a very deep level.Sofia Coppola has quickly established herself as a first rate director.  Luckily, having a father who owns his own studio should guarantee that she is able to continue making films.  Luckily, her talent as a director keeps this from being sheer nepotism.  I liked THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, but her success with LOST IN TRANSLATION shows that that film wasn't a fluke.This is the best film featuring Tokyo that I have ever seen made by a non-native of Tokyo.  There is, of course, a wealth of great Japanese films featuring Tokyo, but these are all insider films, viewing Tokyo as they know it.  It is, for them, home.  But this film shows Tokyo as it appears from the outside, as it would appear to folks like me if they were to go there for the first time.The film has one of the best, most satisfying, and completely ambiguous endings I have ever seen in any film.  The beautiful thing is that no one knows how it ends.  I'll not give any more away by saying more except to say that I don't think we, the viewers, are supposed to know how it ends.  Very beautifully done.As far as the future goes for Bill Murray, he already is committed to do the voice for feline Garfield in the movie of the same name (as unwilling as I will be to see that one, it will probably be a big success at the box office) and will star in Wes Anderson's next film.  After this film and those, I think Murray will be back in a big way.",5,Murray shines in a superbly unusual movie,1064707200,"09 28, 2003",2003,2921,"['past', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'concerned', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'who', 'long', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'performers', 'had', 'been', 'relegated', 'Hollywood', 'exclusively', 'supporting', 'parts', 'string', 'wonderful', 'box', 'office', 'films', 'eighties', 'very', 'early', 'nineties', 'Murray', 'had', 'settled', 'playing', 'largely', 'supporting', 'parts', 'variety', 'smaller', 'films', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'RUSHMORE', 'major', 'exception', 'film', 'however', 'return', 'leading', 'man', 'status', 'Murray', 'most', 'great', 'part.Murray', 'plays', 'American', 'movie', 'star', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'Tokyo', 'make', 'print', 'television', 'ads', 'Japanese', 'brand', 'whiskey', '2', 'million', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'introduced', 'Charlotte', 'young', 'intellectual', 'pretty', 'profoundly', 'disoriented', 'wife', 'John', 'freelance', 'show', 'business', 'photographer', 'Japan', 'do', 'series', 'photo', 'shoots', 'are', 'alienated', 'everything', 'unhappy', 'marriages', 'unable', 'connect', 'culture', 'sleepless', 'One', 'night', 'go', 'bar', 'rather', 'lay', 'bed', 'awake', 'instantly', 'click', 'level', 'spend', 'rest', 'time', 'together', 'Tokyo', 'together', 'Charlotte', 'husband', 'out', 'extended', 'shoot', 'discover', 'other', 'someone', 'enjoy', 'can', 'confide', 'trust', 'love', 'affair', 'deep', 'friendship', 'beauty', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', 'get', 'witness', 'two', 'people', 'one', 'famous', 'one', 'unknown', 'one', 'middle-aged', 'other', 'very', 'young', 'connect', 'very', 'deep', 'level.Sofia', 'Coppola', 'quickly', 'established', 'first', 'rate', 'director', 'Luckily', 'having', 'father', 'who', 'own', 'studio', 'should', 'guarantee', 'able', 'continue', 'making', 'films', 'Luckily', 'talent', 'director', 'being', 'sheer', 'nepotism', 'liked', 'THE', 'VIRGIN', 'SUICIDES', 'success', 'LOST', 'IN', 'TRANSLATION', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'fluke.This', 'best', 'film', 'featuring', 'Tokyo', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'made', 'non-native', 'Tokyo', 'course', 'wealth', 'great', 'Japanese', 'films', 'featuring', 'Tokyo', 'are', 'insider', 'films', 'viewing', 'Tokyo', 'know', 'home', 'film', 'Tokyo', 'outside', 'would', 'appear', 'folks', 'were', 'go', 'there', 'first', 'time.The', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'satisfying', 'completely', 'ambiguous', 'endings', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'one', 'how', ""'ll"", 'not', 'give', 'more', 'away', 'saying', 'more', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'viewers', 'are', 'supposed', 'know', 'how', 'Very', 'beautifully', 'far', 'future', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'already', 'committed', 'do', 'voice', 'feline', 'Garfield', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'as', 'unwilling', 'will', 'be', 'see', 'one', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'big', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'will', 'star', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'next', 'film', 'film', 'think', 'Murray', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'big', 'way']",Lost in Translation
619762,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005JMJ4,Robert Morris,"[0, 1]","As I began to compose this brief commentary, I remembered that Sofia Coppola was cast as the infant being baptized during the final sequence of events in the first Godfather film (1972) which her father directed. She later appeared in Godfather Part III, a last minute and miscast substitute, reputedly for Winona Ryder. How different this film is from those films as well as The Conversation (1974) and Apocalypse Now/Redux (1979) which her father also directed.With regard to Lost in Translation, she wrote the screenplay as well as directed it, evoking brilliant performances from Bill Murray (as Bob Harris) and Scarlett Johansson (as Charlotte). For me, the title suggests multiple dimensions of irony. Some are obviously related to Harris, familiar to those in Tokyo who recognize him but certainly adrift (if not totally lost) in a culture foreign to him in almost every possible way. Other ironies involve communication difficulties unrelated to fluency in language. For example, even after two years of marriage, Charlotte and John (Giovanni Ribisi) are -- to a significant extent -- strangers to each other as are Bob and his wife back in the United States to whom he has been married for quite some time. Moreover, much of the communication between Charlotte and Bob is also lost in translation,  more the result (I think) of generational than linguistic differences. All this suggests an important point to me: It is difficult (if not impossible) for others to know who you are if you don't. It is also so important, moreover, to know who you aren't. Presumably Bob has been struggling with these issues, at least since his career began to evaporate. Both Bob and Charlotte are at or near a crossroad in their respective lives when they first meet. After several days together, their relationship arrives at another crossroad. Which way to go? Where is his life headed? And hers? Will they proceed together?Here are two of several reasons why I admire this film so much. First, thanks to Coppola and her superb cast, it has exceptional charm. There are so many targets of opportunity for a cynical statement. However, to her great credit, she ignores them all. Although there are highly amusing (sometimes zany) moments along the way, to be sure, Coppola develops the characters of Bob and Charlotte with respect and affection but never with condescension. The second reason is that this film has great natural energy which Coppola juxtaposes with moments of intimacy, tenderness, reflection, and even poignancy. To achieve that, Coppola and Lance Acord blend as well as balance exterior shots of Tokyo at night (which resembles Las Vegas) with exterior shots of religious shrines during the day, thereby complementing Charlotte and Bob's diverse moods as they explore at least some of the country in which they feel lost.Given what she achieves in this film, I am eager to see how Coppola's career develops in years to come. My hunch (only a hunch) is that her talents are more diverse than those of her father (e.g. slapstick comedy) and thus the nature and extent of opportunities which await her are greater than those available to him after the first Godfather film (1972). He must be a very proud father....and should be.FYI: The special features of the DVD version include a conversation with Coppola and Murray, a behind-the-scenes featurette which includes exclusive footage shot by the filmmakers (""Lost on Location""), several deleted scenes, and an extended version of the Japanese TV show, ""Matthew's Best Hit TV.""",5,A Charming Lost and Found Experience,1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,3538,"['began', 'compose', 'brief', 'commentary', 'remembered', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'was', 'cast', 'infant', 'being', 'baptized', 'final', 'sequence', 'events', 'first', 'Godfather', 'film', '1972', 'father', 'directed', 'later', 'appeared', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'last', 'minute', 'miscast', 'substitute', 'reputedly', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'How', 'different', 'film', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'Conversation', '1974', 'Apocalypse', 'Now/Redux', '1979', 'father', 'also', 'regard', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'directed', 'evoking', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Charlotte', 'title', 'multiple', 'dimensions', 'irony', 'are', 'obviously', 'related', 'Harris', 'familiar', 'Tokyo', 'who', 'recognize', 'certainly', 'adrift', 'not', 'totally', 'lost', 'culture', 'foreign', 'almost', 'possible', 'way', 'Other', 'ironies', 'involve', 'communication', 'difficulties', 'unrelated', 'fluency', 'language', 'example', 'even', 'two', 'years', 'marriage', 'Charlotte', 'John', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'are', 'significant', 'extent', 'strangers', 'other', 'are', 'Bob', 'wife', 'back', 'United', 'States', 'whom', 'been', 'married', 'quite', 'time', 'Moreover', 'much', 'communication', 'Charlotte', 'Bob', 'also', 'lost', 'translation', 'more', 'result', 'think', 'generational', 'linguistic', 'differences', 'important', 'point', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'others', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'also', 'so', 'important', 'moreover', 'know', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'Presumably', 'Bob', 'been', 'struggling', 'issues', 'least', 'career', 'began', 'evaporate', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'crossroad', 'respective', 'lives', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'several', 'days', 'together', 'relationship', 'crossroad', 'Which', 'way', 'go', 'Where', 'life', 'headed', 'hers', 'Will', 'proceed', 'together', 'Here', 'are', 'two', 'several', 'reasons', 'why', 'admire', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'First', 'thanks', 'Coppola', 'superb', 'cast', 'exceptional', 'charm', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'targets', 'opportunity', 'cynical', 'statement', 'However', 'great', 'credit', 'are', 'highly', 'amusing', 'sometimes', 'zany', 'moments', 'way', 'be', 'sure', 'Coppola', 'characters', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'respect', 'affection', 'never', 'condescension', 'second', 'reason', 'film', 'great', 'natural', 'energy', 'Coppola', 'moments', 'intimacy', 'tenderness', 'reflection', 'even', 'poignancy', 'achieve', 'Coppola', 'Lance', 'Acord', 'blend', 'as', 'well', 'balance', 'exterior', 'shots', 'Tokyo', 'night', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'exterior', 'shots', 'religious', 'shrines', 'day', 'thereby', 'complementing', 'Charlotte', 'Bob', 'diverse', 'moods', 'explore', 'least', 'country', 'feel', 'lost.Given', 'what', 'film', 'am', 'eager', 'see', 'how', 'Coppola', 'career', 'years', 'come', 'My', 'hunch', 'only', 'hunch', 'talents', 'are', 'more', 'diverse', 'father', 'e.g', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'thus', 'nature', 'extent', 'opportunities', 'await', 'are', 'greater', 'available', 'first', 'Godfather', 'film', '1972', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'proud', 'father', '.and', 'should', 'be.FYI', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'version', 'include', 'conversation', 'Coppola', 'Murray', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'exclusive', 'footage', 'shot', 'filmmakers', 'Lost', 'Location', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'extended', 'version', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'show', 'Matthew', 'Best', 'Hit', 'TV']",Lost in Translation

619764,AM4ZQJ0IORVWG,B00005JMJ4,"Rob ""Revuman""","[4, 5]","Focus films may be known for distributing films that are outside the formulaic holiwood system, but they're not so great on packing the disc with extras that most people want from a movie that's on the academy awards top honor list (Best Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay (original), and Film).Since my fellow reviewer above has talked at great length about the beauty and grace (as well as plot) of this film, I'm going to focus on the DVD EXTRAS and the PURCHASE VALUE of this dvd.The Movie:  The 1:85:1 Anamorphic widescreen looks just as it should. The audio is a little on the quiet side at times, but should be loud enough through the center channel.  Considering what 5.1 stands for in the film industry these days...you're not going to get much out of your surround sound speakers...so a 2.0 track would have been nice.  The performances by Mr. Murray and Ms. Johansson are particularly sublime, in both what is said and what isn't said, considering the lengthy visual montages that occur throughout the film.  What might end up throwing some people off is Ms. Coppola's use of the camera and where she decides to put the focus.  She will, from time to time, let images slide in and out of focus and/or have the center of the frame far off from the action, catching bits of each event but never really focusing the scene on any one character.  However, taught editing saves this piece from spiraling downward into the realm of the visually incoherent, and the minimalist script fills in the gaps of picture/music/ambient sound nicely.  Overall: a well done sophomore attempt.The Extras:  NO COMMENTARY TRACK!  This movie is screaming for a commentary track.  And yet, we don't get the pleasure of one.  So a lot of things that might have been explained directly from the horses mouth get left to confusion or, to put it frankly, &quot;lost in translation&quot;.  Sure, I think it's great to put commentary tracks on the big budget films and find out how difficult it was, exactly, to blow up that big thing with the other big thing.  But I'm equally as interested to hear how it went behind the scenes of these smaller, artier films...how the director had to get certain shots, if they improved a scene a certain way or not, was it difficult shooting the Megalopolis of Tokyo, Japan, etc.  In my opinion, that's equally as interesting.  Word to the wise, Ms. Coppola: please don't go the route of Mr. Spielberg, give us our commentary.Then there is the &quot;Lost on Location&quot; documentary on the filming process.  It's about 30-40 minutes long and has some interesting scenes on how shooting went down, some funny outtakes and tidbits of information.  But once again, it doesn't really go into any details.  It doesn't explain where she got the idea, why Japan, what the studios thought of the idea, what her folks thought, what interested Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  But at least it's quaint.Then there's the last worthwhile extra, the &quot;Interview Murray and Coppola&quot; - which is taken a year after the film and is about 10 minutes long.  It gives a small window into why the picture was made and some of the hard points of doing a picture like &quot;Translation&quot;, but doesn't really dig deep.  It's just an interview with bits of film footage cut in between clips of the interview.The Lowdown:  If you saw the movie and loved it or you heard the hype and wanted to see what everyone was talking about, then by all means you should totally get this DVD.  The movie, love it or hate it, is the kind of filmmaking that rarely sees the light of day in this &quot;popcorn thriller&quot; producer driven cinema world we see today.  However, if you're looking for a DVD that answers some of your burning questions or brings to light things you didn't notice when you saw it in the theaters, look somewhere else...because this DVD package doesn't even come close.  Maybe if it wins some awards we'll see a second release with a commentary track or two...but I'm not holding my breath.`Revu",3,"Great Movie, But a little short on the DVD Extras",1077062400,"02 18, 2004",2004,4021,"['Focus', 'films', 'may', 'be', 'known', 'distributing', 'films', 'are', 'formulaic', 'holiwood', 'system', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'great', 'packing', 'disc', 'extras', 'most', 'people', 'want', 'movie', 'academy', 'awards', 'top', 'honor', 'list', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Actress', 'Director', 'Screenplay', 'original', 'Film', '.Since', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'talked', 'great', 'length', 'beauty', 'grace', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'film', ""'m"", 'going', 'focus', 'DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'PURCHASE', 'VALUE', 'dvd.The', 'Movie', '1:85:1', 'Anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'just', 'should', 'audio', 'little', 'quiet', 'side', 'times', 'should', 'be', 'loud', 'enough', 'center', 'channel', 'Considering', 'what', '5.1', 'stands', 'film', 'industry', 'days', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'much', 'surround', 'sound', 'speakers', 'so', '2.0', 'track', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'performances', 'Mr.', 'Murray', 'Ms.', 'Johansson', 'are', 'particularly', 'sublime', 'what', 'said', 'what', ""n't"", 'said', 'considering', 'lengthy', 'visual', 'montages', 'occur', 'film', 'What', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'throwing', 'people', 'off', 'Ms.', 'Coppola', 'use', 'camera', 'where', 'put', 'focus', 'will', 'time', 'time', 'let', 'images', 'slide', 'focus', 'and/or', 'have', 'center', 'frame', 'far', 'action', 'catching', 'bits', 'event', 'never', 'really', 'focusing', 'scene', 'one', 'character', 'However', 'taught', 'editing', 'saves', 'piece', 'spiraling', 'downward', 'realm', 'visually', 'incoherent', 'minimalist', 'script', 'fills', 'gaps', 'picture/music/ambient', 'sound', 'nicely', 'Overall', 'well', 'done', 'sophomore', 'attempt.The', 'Extras', 'COMMENTARY', 'TRACK', 'movie', 'screaming', 'commentary', 'track', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'pleasure', 'one', 'lot', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'explained', 'directly', 'horses', 'mouth', 'get', 'left', 'confusion', 'put', 'frankly', 'quot', 'lost', 'translation', 'quot', 'Sure', 'think', 'great', 'put', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'exactly', 'blow', 'up', 'big', 'thing', 'other', 'big', 'thing', ""'m"", 'equally', 'as', 'interested', 'hear', 'how', 'went', 'scenes', 'smaller', 'artier', 'films', 'how', 'director', 'had', 'get', 'certain', 'shots', 'improved', 'scene', 'certain', 'way', 'not', 'was', 'difficult', 'shooting', 'Megalopolis', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'etc', 'opinion', 'equally', 'interesting', 'Word', 'wise', 'Ms.', 'Coppola', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'route', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'give', 'commentary.Then', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Location', 'quot', 'documentary', 'filming', 'process', '30-40', 'minutes', 'long', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'how', 'shooting', 'went', 'down', 'funny', 'outtakes', 'tidbits', 'information', 'once', 'again', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'details', ""n't"", 'explain', 'where', 'got', 'idea', 'why', 'Japan', 'what', 'studios', 'thought', 'idea', 'what', 'folks', 'thought', 'what', 'interested', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'least', 'last', 'worthwhile', 'extra', 'quot', 'Interview', 'Murray', 'Coppola', 'quot', 'taken', 'year', 'film', 'about', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'small', 'window', 'why', 'picture', 'was', 'made', 'hard', 'points', 'doing', 'picture', 'quot', 'Translation', 'quot', ""n't"", 'really', 'dig', 'deep', 'just', 'interview', 'bits', 'film', 'footage', 'cut', 'clips', 'interview.The', 'Lowdown', 'saw', 'movie', 'loved', 'heard', 'hype', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'everyone', 'was', 'talking', 'then', 'means', 'should', 'totally', 'get', 'DVD', 'movie', 'love', 'hate', 'kind', 'filmmaking', 'rarely', 'light', 'day', 'quot', 'thriller', 'quot', 'producer', 'driven', 'cinema', 'world', 'see', 'today', 'However', ""'re"", 'looking', 'DVD', 'burning', 'questions', 'brings', 'light', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'when', 'saw', 'theaters', 'look', 'somewhere', 'else', 'DVD', 'package', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'see', 'second', 'release', 'commentary', 'track', 'two', ""'m"", 'not', 'holding', 'breath.', 'Revu']",Lost in Translation
619765,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JMJ4,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 11]","As its title suggests, Sofia Coppola's Oscar-nominated film is the story of two lost souls who find one another in a foreign-speaking land (in this case, Tokyo).  Bob Harris is a world-famous action movie star from the 1970's who is in the city to appear in a commercial for a Japanese whiskey.  Charlotte is a young American woman in her twenties who has flown over from the states to be with her photographer husband while he does a shoot for a Japanese rock band.  Staying at the same luxury hotel, Bob and Charlotte eventually cross paths and find themselves irresistibly drawn to one another.Bob and Charlotte are both introspective people, fully convinced that the lives they are leading are sterile, stifling and meaningless.  Bob, despite the obvious ""success"" he's enjoyed - fame, fortune and family - finds himself burned out and deeply dissatisfied with virtually every aspect of the life he's built for himself.  When we first meet Bob, he appears to be a man dragging himself through life, utterly unable even to feign the interest and enthusiasm that the people he meets expect of him.  In a brilliant performance, Bill Murray conveys this weary cynicism more through his body language and facial expressions than through words.  Indeed, it isn't until much later in the film - after he and Charlotte have found one another and have begun to communicate on an intimate level - that Bob is able to even halfway articulate what it is he is going though.  Charlotte, despite the fact that she is essentially just starting out in life, feels equally lost and rudderless, finding herself married to a man with whom she has little in common both intellectually and emotionally.  As Charlotte, Scarlett Johansson provides a poignant portrait of a woman who has so much to offer if only someone would be open enough to accept it.  Luckily for her, Bob comes along to do just that; unluckily, he is no more ""available"" than she is to make this relationship work.As conceived by Coppola, ""Lost in Translation"" is more than just a tremendously sad evocation of unrequited love.  It is a heartrending tale about what happens when we not only marry the wrong person but end up meeting our soul mate when it is obviously too late to do anything about it.  As a writer, Coppola has opted to convey more of her meaning through silence and indirection than through dialogue and drama.  As a director, she often lingers for long periods of time over seemingly irrelevant details of daily life, creating a lyrical, poetic mood that enhances the melancholic tale she is telling.  The film sometimes feels more undernourished and less revelatory than it might have been had she allowed her characters to open up to each other in a more fully articulate way.  We sometimes feels as if Bob and Charlotte have so much more to say to each other - and to us - that we end up growing strangely impatient.  But then we just have to remind ourselves that that is the point Coppola is setting out to make here, that we can't always find the words to express the complexity of our feelings adequately and that sometimes we just have to find that special person who can understand us at our deepest level even without words.  That is what Bob and Charlotte do for one another as epitomized by that whispered bit of dialogue at the end that the audience is never intended to hear.  What Bob says to Charlotte we never know, but, whatever it is, it has meaning and significance only to her.""Lost in Translation"" demands a certain level of patience from its audience.

For those seeking action, this movie will disappoint.  For people who like character studies with more than a touch of real-life situations and choices, this is a GOOD movie.  Though Hollywood would have us believe such encounters always end in sex, and often regrets, my own experiences, and those of many others I know, found companionship on lone trips that made the trip nicer, even if no follow-up was expected or done.  It's ok to meet (in my case) a gal where sex is not on the menu.  I enjoy meeting people.  I'm not married.  So while some think me a potential threat, I'm not handsome or debonair, just an intelligent guy who likes to share experiences with someone interesting.  Some women don't care for that, some do.  The movie reflects the latter, and I found it interesting as an older/younger relationship based on two bored people looking for that companionship.  I thought it well done, and just realistic enough to enjoy.  Too much gratuitous sex in too many movies to titillate the youngsters, and this brought it back to more human.  Good movie for a relaxing evening, even with a girlfriend (it's not threatening) or casual date.  Some nice scenery in Japan, and points up Tokyo's horrendous urban jungle.

The soundtrack is angsty and ironic. And the humor is pretty much mild slapstick given artsy cinematography.

""Ryan Lattanzio""","[5, 9]","I saw this film back in September 2003 and am now posting my original review.""Lost In Translation"" is the best film of 2003 without a doubt. It is the most original film in years, and Sofia Coppola directs and writes with a perfect artistry. Now, here is a love story that doesn't involve the sheets and messy bed linens that lie around the hotel in the morning, the lovers each wearing robes. It is proof that a film romance can survive without the corny and unnecessary, conventional sex scene. Then again, Bill Murray in that kind of situation would be a little disturbing.The plot of ""Lost in Translation"" is simple. That is because it is not a plot-driven film, but it is a character and dialogue driven film. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a has-been American movie star staying at a hotel in Tokyo to shoot a Japanese whiskey commercial. His wife and children back at home could care less about him and Bob feels unwanted and lonely. That is, until he meets Charlotte (played by the incredible 18 year-old Scarlett Johansson), the wife of a vain fashion photographer (Ribisi) who is shooting in Tokyo. He is oblivious to his young wife's unhappiness and sadness, and Charlotte is also lost in life. She doesn't know what to be even though she has graduated from Yale in Philosophy. Charlotte and Bob each wander the streets of Tokyo, and the making of the whiskey commercial is hilarious. Neither can sleep and they meet one restless night in the hotel bar, and they instantly click. They do not become passionate lovers, though. The two become friends immediately and take off on adventures in the city, being weary of the hotel. It is obvious that they fall in love, but there is no steamy make out scene and there is no wildly hot sex scene to go along with it. No. The film is perfect without it.Everything about this film is just so wonderful. Coppola has proven herself to be one of the strongest female women in the directing and writing industry of film. Her last film, ""The Virgin Suicides,"" was also a great film, but this one is even better. Sofia has more control and confidence in her work now. The dialogue is witty, as are the performances. Murray has never been better and breaks his stereotypical image of comedian. Johansson has come out of the dark and will certainly be one of the best actresses in the future. She is already one of the best actresses of this generation, and her performance in this film is literally flawless. There aren't many characters in this film, and I could understand why an audience might be bored and leave the theater. Well, first of all, learn to research into a movie before you waste your hard earned money on purchasing a ticket. Second of all, there is a lot to think and understand about this film. People who don't ""get"" it do not take much time to really consider and think about it.The production of this film is interesting and appealing. The look is fantastic, and the cinematography gets the audience right into what is going on in the character's heads. It's so charming. The music is very 80s-like and sets a perfect setting for the film. Tokyo comes to life as it never has before on the screen. I love it!""Lost in Translation"" is a film about loneliness, and isn't depressing and conventional. It completely deserved the Oscar for best picture of the year.

As a fading movie star, Bob Harris, he's never been better, and he's just about perfect: A wise, attractive, cynical presence with enough vigor and hope to recognize a much younger kindred spirit when he sees one.That spirit is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, announcing her arrival as a seriously talented actress), a recent Yale graduate, and both she and Bob are holed up in a luxury Tokyo hotel slightly against their better judgments: Bob is there to film a whiskey commercial; Charlotte skulks around the hotel while her photographer husband is on location. Sofia Coppola's sophomore writing/directing effort - and boy, is it no slump - is at least as much strange love borne of chance hotel encounters as it is about the cultural eccentricities of Tokyo, a gizmo metropolis that nonetheless seems hushed an intimate despite the crowded streets.After an opening half-hour of culture clash comedy - including a bizarre Japanese prostitute and the sublime, hilarious commercial shoot - that hooks the audience, Coppola blends a detached, bemused commentary on Japan with the May-December romance seamlessly.  She has an ear for honest dialogue, and an eye for well-paced, intimate scenes.Bob and Charlotte's first meeting at the hotel bar after hours is awkward but sexy. Charlotte is still a work in progress, not tied to any career or family - and not particularly self-involved like most women her age - and Bob, at an age where introspection is stock and trade, is the kind of cynical, finger-snapping well from which she'd like to draw. Johansson doesn't push her acting style - she never rages or pouts or betrays too much emotion through facial tics. But the shy, intelligent performance grounds the picture, and provides Murray the stage to at long last unfurl some Cary Grant charm.The supporting cast, which includes Giovanni Ribisi as the geek-turned-gadfly photographer and Anna Faris as an airheaded actress working a junket at the same hotel, leave their small marks.  And Tokyo itself is a character, with its bright lights rivaling Vegas. Paired with a warm, near-lullaby soundtrack, Coppola and cinematographer Lance Acord (""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"") punctuate ""Lost In Translation"" with dreamy, gorgeous Tokyo snapshots - Bob's golf outing near Mt. Fuji is the standout - without giving the film over to outright tourism. A club scene is pretty flat, but Coppola redeems it with a funny karaoke sequence inside a high-rise. The movie drags again while it brings Bob and Charlotte to the point where they admit the attraction, or remain coy.It's Bob who blinks, not surprisingly, but ""Lost In Translation"" ends with a powerful reconciliation that cements their connection. The movie's extended, final goodbye in a Tokyo market is shamelessly romantic, yet one of the great scenes in recent memory.

The girl is bored in her marriage, so is he. What seemed strange was that the movie's name is ""Lost In Translation"", and since the story is set in Japan, you would think this might be some kind of love story between an American and a Japanese. But it turned out that it was a story between two Americans. This totally defeats the purpose of having the movie set in Japan. The only thing that is remotely related to Japan is when they shamelessly make fun of Japanese people and the cultural differences.There isn't a structured plot in this moive.

This is a subtle movie about two lonely people in a foreign land trying to figure out what to do next in life.  The contrast between the two characters, played by Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, provides an interesting story.  Scarlett is a young woman, newly married and graduated from college while Bill is a famous actor whose prime days have passed and yet both are struggling with finding direction in their lives.  Their struggle is compounded by the fact that they are in a strange country with stark cultural differences and have indifferent spouses.  This is a movie about friendship and making the most out of a tough situation.  It reminds me a bit of &quot;The Big Chill&quot; but without the ensemble cast.

Before meeting, both Bob and Scarlett are alienated in the foreign Japanese culture but after befriending each other they create a unique friendship based on their circumstances that enable them to survive their stay in Tokyo.In this film Bill Murray proves once again that he has the ability to be a brilliant actor.

Many others have described the good points and the bad points of this movie, and they are both accurate.  So why is this one of the ""best"" and ""worst"" movies ever?If you have ever travelled alone to a strange city - not with family, friends, or co-workers - then you can relate to this story.  The best comment from other viewers is that Lost in Translation shows what it is like to be alone even when you are surrounded by other people.  Tokyo is a perfect choice for this movie because it is so crowded but also has a language/culture barrier for the main characters.  They are incapable of interacting with the world around them, yet are trapped in their hotel and a few nearby haunts.Both characters are trapped by things that they cannot control, both during the several days shown in this movie, as well as the rest of their lives.  If you cannot see that, then you won't understand the movie.  How many 50 year olds set off by themselves in search of adventure in foreign lands?  And how many young wives head off and leave their husbands to see new sights?  I found both of these things to be realistic, and I could relate to how the main characters were thus trapped in the hotel.If you give this movie a single star, and can't relate to the characters, then try this -- go to a restaurant by yourself, and ask for a ""table for one"".  Don't take your cell phone or newspaper, don't take a friend, and don't go to a restaurant you normally go to.  Even better would be to try one with an unusual style of food.  Walk in, sit down, order your food, and wait.  Then wait some more.  If this sounds like great fun to you, then you will not like Lost in Translation.  If doing this for a solid week sounds like it would make you lonely, then you might want to look around the restaurant to see if Bill Murray or Scarlett Johanesson are sitting by themselves at another table.

619792,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JMJ4,Scott Schiefelbein,"[8, 14]","Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" is, for lack of a better word, a masterpiece.  Grounded by two wonderfully restrained performances by two talented actors as well as a pitch-perfect supporting cast, this movie tells a melancholy, intelligent romantic tale of two lost Americans who find redemption in each other.There may not be a better city in which to cast Americans adrift than Tokyo.  Ms. Coppola's personal experiences in this neon-lit metropolis reportedly provided some of the inspiration for this movie, and the movie definitely satisfies that backstory.  A very quiet film, many of its most important moments transpire when a single character silently tries to absorb this fantastic place, and simply comes up short.  Whether its a shot out over the city from a high motel window, or up from the streets to the gigantic neon advertisements, the viewer perpetually shrinks to insignificance in the face of Tokyo's sheer mass.Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, an actor's whose cinematic successes and his ambition are behind him, in town to shoot a booze commercial for $2 million.  He is saddled with a bevy of Japanese ""handlers"" at his hotel who are over-eager to assist him, and his attempts to work with his Japanese-speaking director are priceless (needless to say, Harris speaks no Japanese and doesn't want to make the effort to learn). Murray may have been cast perfectly in his world-famous comedies like ""Caddyshack"" and ""Stripes,"" but he was born to play Bob.  Murray radiates fatigue, and his tired eyes reveal a soul that could find the humor in his ridiculous situation but is just too drained to make the effort.  His repeated phone calls home to his distant wife fail to recharge his soul, and if anything, create a bigger burden to bear.  Bob is truly a man too weighted down by his choices to pursue his dreams any longer.Charlotte (Scarlett Johannson, in another shockingly good performance) is in many respects Bob's alter ego.  Charlotte's obtuse, insensitive husband John (a great supporting performance by Giovanni Ribisi) is a photographer in Tokyo for a shoot, and Charlotte has tagged along.  John, eager to make it in the entertainment biz, quickly abandons Charlotte, and she is cast adrift in the enormity of Tokyo.  But as a 25-year old Yale graduate, she is intelligent enough to know that she should be doing more but is perhaps too young to know what her life's ambition should be.  In her own way, Charlotte is as adrift as Bob, but she bears the burden of cautious inexperience.These two lost souls meet in the chic hotel bar.  Bob is attracted to Charlotte's beauty and innocent wit, while Charlotte is drawn to this man of charm and obvious experience.  Soon they are exploring both Tokyo and each other, both through their conversations and their mutual ability to inspire the good things in each other.  Romance is obviously kindling between them, but both also put on the brakes . . . out of a combined sense of propriety -- both are married after all -- and also a sense that this relationship is too important for a tumble in the sack.Eventually, the movie builds to its much-discussed climax, a whispered assertion that will have you leaning forward in your seat as you strain to hear what is actually said.  This entirely unexpected ending is one of the most romantic and hopeful moments you will ever see on screen.If you have ever complained that all Hollywood is interested in is big-budget star-driven shoot-em-ups that spend more effort on their stunts than their dialogue, this movie is a perfect antidote.  While it's doubtful that ""Lost in Translation"" will create a tourist boom for Tokyo, the movie is also made with an obvious affection for the big Japanese city, and that in its own way is touching as well.A must for the film library!",5,Two Lost Characters Find Themselves in Tokyo,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,3801,"['Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'masterpiece', 'Grounded', 'two', 'wonderfully', 'restrained', 'performances', 'two', 'talented', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'pitch-perfect', 'supporting', 'cast', 'movie', 'melancholy', 'intelligent', 'romantic', 'tale', 'two', 'lost', 'Americans', 'who', 'find', 'redemption', 'other.There', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'city', 'cast', 'Americans', 'adrift', 'Tokyo', 'Ms.', 'Coppola', 'personal', 'experiences', 'neon-lit', 'metropolis', 'reportedly', 'provided', 'inspiration', 'movie', 'movie', 'definitely', 'backstory', 'very', 'quiet', 'film', 'many', 'most', 'important', 'moments', 'transpire', 'when', 'single', 'character', 'silently', 'absorb', 'fantastic', 'place', 'simply', 'up', 'short', 'shot', 'out', 'city', 'high', 'motel', 'window', 'up', 'streets', 'gigantic', 'neon', 'advertisements', 'viewer', 'perpetually', 'insignificance', 'face', 'Tokyo', 'sheer', 'mass.Bill', 'Murray', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'actor', 'cinematic', 'successes', 'ambition', 'are', 'town', 'shoot', 'booze', 'commercial', '2', 'million', 'saddled', 'bevy', 'Japanese', 'handlers', 'hotel', 'who', 'are', 'over-eager', 'assist', 'attempts', 'work', 'Japanese-speaking', 'director', 'are', 'priceless', 'needless', 'say', 'Harris', 'Japanese', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'effort', 'learn', 'Murray', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'world-famous', 'comedies', 'Caddyshack', 'Stripes', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Bob', 'Murray', 'fatigue', 'tired', 'eyes', 'reveal', 'soul', 'could', 'find', 'humor', 'ridiculous', 'situation', 'just', 'too', 'drained', 'make', 'effort', 'repeated', 'phone', 'home', 'distant', 'wife', 'fail', 'recharge', 'soul', 'anything', 'create', 'bigger', 'burden', 'bear', 'Bob', 'truly', 'man', 'too', 'weighted', 'down', 'choices', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'longer.Charlotte', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'shockingly', 'good', 'performance', 'many', 'respects', 'Bob', 'alter', 'ego', 'Charlotte', 'obtuse', 'insensitive', 'husband', 'John', 'great', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'photographer', 'Tokyo', 'shoot', 'Charlotte', 'tagged', 'along', 'John', 'eager', 'make', 'entertainment', 'biz', 'quickly', 'abandons', 'Charlotte', 'cast', 'adrift', 'enormity', 'Tokyo', '25-year', 'old', 'Yale', 'graduate', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'know', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'more', 'perhaps', 'too', 'young', 'know', 'what', 'life', 'ambition', 'should', 'be', 'own', 'way', 'Charlotte', 'as', 'adrift', 'Bob', 'burden', 'cautious', 'inexperience.These', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'meet', 'chic', 'hotel', 'bar', 'Bob', 'attracted', 'Charlotte', 'beauty', 'innocent', 'wit', 'Charlotte', 'drawn', 'man', 'charm', 'obvious', 'experience', 'Soon', 'are', 'exploring', 'Tokyo', 'other', 'conversations', 'mutual', 'ability', 'inspire', 'good', 'things', 'other', 'Romance', 'obviously', 'kindling', 'also', 'put', 'brakes', 'combined', 'sense', 'propriety', 'are', 'married', 'also', 'sense', 'relationship', 'too', 'important', 'tumble', 'sack.Eventually', 'movie', 'much-discussed', 'climax', 'whispered', 'assertion', 'will', 'have', 'leaning', 'forward', 'seat', 'strain', 'hear', 'what', 'actually', 'said', 'entirely', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'one', 'most', 'romantic', 'hopeful', 'moments', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'screen.If', 'have', 'ever', 'complained', 'Hollywood', 'interested', 'big-budget', 'star-driven', 'shoot-em-ups', 'spend', 'more', 'effort', 'stunts', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'perfect', 'antidote', 'doubtful', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'will', 'create', 'tourist', 'boom', 'Tokyo', 'movie', 'also', 'made', 'obvious', 'affection', 'big', 'Japanese', 'city', 'own', 'way', 'touching', 'well.A', 'must', 'film', 'library']",Lost in Translation

It doesn't matter if you are in your 20s trying to figure everything out, or if you are middle-aged trying to understand where your life went and if there is anything left in the future.Lost in Translation is about two people with a 30-year age gap, who find that essentially their life situations are not so different.Scarlett  Johanssen is Charlotte.  She is in Japan with her husband who is a photographer.  He is in Japan on assignment to cover a band.  She tags along because she didn't figure there was anything else for her to do.  She spends much of her time staring out of the window of her hotel room wondering if there is anything else to her life.  Where is her life going?  How can she get out of the rut she feels she is in?Bill Murray, (who turns in the best performance of his career and who has already stated that ""Lost in Translation"" is his favorite film of his body of work) is Bob Harris, a famous American actor who is in Japan to shoot a commercial to promote Suntori Whiskey.  He doesn't want to be there.  He is a man going through the motions, and for all of his professional success, wonders why he doesn't seem especially happy and if it is too late to start any kind of a new life.In many ways, these two characters compliment each other and provide for each other with the necessary vision to realize that they can make changes to their lives and perhaps realize that there is still something good and wonderful to live for.  Bob helps Charlotte to see the possibilities ahead of her, while Charlotte helps Bob to appreciate the life he has, even though he now knows that he needs a new focus.Bob sees the road he has already travelled while Charlotte only sees a road of unknowns.  She explains that she feels stuck.  She has tried her hand at different things without any kind of real fulfillment.  She has tried writing and photography without any kind of feeling of accomplishment.  Bob explains that he isn't worried about her at all because she is young and she will figure it out (which is probably similar to what he did at her age).  Bob, on the other hand, seems to feel almost cut-off from everyone.  Part of this is self-imposed as he seems to constantly be dodging fans who interrupt him while he is trying to enjoy a quiet moment at the hotel bar.  However, he talks to his wife who sounds more than just annoyed with him on the phone.  She sends him faxes at 4:00am about carpet samples.  One has to wonder if she really feels she needs his input, or if it is simply a way for her to have some kind of a conversation with him, even if it is about something as mundane as what color of carpet should be picked for his study.  He finally confesses to his wife on the phone, ""I'm lost.""There is something to be said for two ""lost"" souls who find each other in Tokyo, Japan.  Neither one, it seems, is particularly happy to be in Japan.  Neither one is able to sleep, and so they meet at the hotel bar.  There must be something there, as Bob sends a small smile across the room to Charlotte after she buys him a drink.  Somehow, Bob realizes that this is not another admiring fan.  He sees something genuine in Charlotte.  Before long, the two begin to spend some time together.The time they spend together is only the foundation.  Soon, they begin to have conversations, each sharing about where they are in life and why they don't seem to be particularly happy.  Charlotte begins to see possibilities in Bob, and Bob begins to see new vision of life (one he's forgotten) in Charlotte.  The irony of the relationship is in the friendship and how each is able to provide some level of healing to the other.  However, given Bob's age and life experience, it is clear that he is the leader of the relationship.  Charlotte is worried about her life, but Bob tells her, ""The more you know yourself and what you want, the less you let things upset you.""  However, the irony of when Bob tells Charlotte this, he realizes that he needs to remember this himself.  Another example is when Charlotte finds out that Bob has spent the night with a woman.  It's obvious she is upset and a tad jealous.  Bob wisely retorts, ""Wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?""  Charlotte doesn't take the statement well, at first, until she realizes on some level that this is exactly what she wants: attention; someone to let her know that they care about her.  Her husband tells her that he loves her, but then he's out the door.  She wants someone to be with her.  And it is this element that now seems to be missing in her marriage.Charlotte's husband, John, tries to be there for her, but he is so caught up in his work, that it is obvious that Charlotte has become secondary for him even though it is clear that he loves her.  Charlotte feels she is little more than another piece of luggage simply brought along for the trip.  She even states, ""I don't know who I married.""After a few days together, Bob tells her that he doesn't want to leave, when just a few days prior, he would have given anything to get out of Japan.  Charlotte has become a window to the possibility of a new life.  And for Charlotte, Bob is a light to a path that was once dark.  This is how each serves the other.  It is obvious that the two love each other.  It isn't so much of a romantic love as it is a genuine, loving friendship, and when it is time for them to part, as much as it hurts, brings the realization that it is time for each to go their own way.Sofia Coppola masterfully navigates the story without it becoming two mired down in melodrama.  She keeps things simple and real, which is probably why so many viewers find themselves relating to the characters and the story.  It could be anyone, and this is why it works so well.People don't often realize that strange surroundings and a stranger can be just the necessary ingredients for change and redirection and a refocus of one's life.  These types of ingredients can create a kind of bubble, which it does for Charlotte and Bob.  While they do interact with other people, it is about them in a small world created by each of them.  An environment which seems to foreign can be exactly what one needs to reach out to someone.  I don't think Charlotte would have met Bob if they had been in America.  Why would they?  In Japan, the environment allows each of them to stand out just enough to get the attention of the other.Lost in Translation is one of my favorite films of the last decade, and the magic is in the story of two realistic characters who are trying to figure out their lives.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen play their roles perfectly, as if each truly knows and understands their characters.  Ironically, this is what most people are trying to do every, single day of their lives.",5,Lost in Translation Is A True Treasure,1338508800,"06 1, 2012",2012,6894,"['***POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS',

I like &quot;typical&quot; American movies, but I also enjoy other types of creations when they are of good quality. At first I was a little weary about watching this movie because I thought there was a lot of hype created by the fact that the director, Sophia Coppola, is the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola. This is not the first time the legendary director shows his fatherly support either; Francis Ford Coppola was thrown into the spotlight of critics when he selected his daughter for a role in &quot;The Godfather III&quot;. Luckily, I can say that the hype was right! This movie is everything it promises to be and more.Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a famous actor in the decline of his career; he ends up in Tokyo filming a commercial for Suntory whisky in exchange for the enticing sum of two million dollars. Right from his arrival in Japan the clash of cultures is apparent. Bob feels out of place, is too tall, does not understand the language, is confused by the different cultural uses, feels lonely, is having a midlife crisis, is unsure about his relationship with his wife; Bob is...Lost in Translation. Until he finds Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who is in Tokyo with her husband and having a hard time dealing with staying alone in the hotel while her husband goes to work as a photographer. After getting acquainted in the bar of the hotel on a sleepless night, Bob and Charlotte begin a very interesting and complex friendship.The mood of the movie may be depressing at times, and Coppola tried to alleviate this in certain way by inserting humorous situations. I do not think this is a comedy though, as it has been categorized in some award shows. The performances of both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are extraordinary and they deserve each and every one of the nominations and awards won. I was especially awed by the discovery of this young actress, who can portray with extreme ability and versatility two very different roles: this one and the one in &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot;. Overall, this is a movie that I would recommend to all those people that would not be bothered by a slow development of the story.

The soundtrack perfectly adds to the mood without distracting.  The cinematography is stunning, notwishstanding Sofia's transparent and charmingly self-effacing comment delivered by Scarlett Johansson: &quot;I tried taking pictures, but they were so mediocre.

619797,A2WFWDI3XN6D7N,B00005JMJ4,Sejanus,"[5, 6]","I've watched this film many times, and it never ceases to impress me. Much has been said about the Western actors in this film, but I want to comment on the Japanese side where the actors also do a magnificent job.  Their portrayals fit seemlessly into the heady milieu of this story. It amazed me the way the film immerses the viewer into the Tokyo scene so realistically, giving one the sense of cultural vertigo. After living in Japan for more than 10 years, I can attest this story uncannily captures the feeling, the sights and the sounds of a foreigner's experience in Japan.I would also like to add that Sofia Coppola seems to have managed to do something few Western artists could ever hope to do by conveying the character and humor of Tokyo with a story rooted in the Japanese perspective. The restrained romance between Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansen reflects the style of great Japanese literature. While this film is a comedy, its central story is of a fleeting relationship immersed in a sensory whirlwind which is very much akin to the stories and novels of, for instance, Noble laureate Yasunari Kawabata. It is the classic cherry blossom theme, and the symbolism in the film is enough to establish that fact. Coppola has woven the texture of beauty and sadness, of love and fleeting happiness, into the fabric of the film as a Japanese novelist would have. One cannot help wondering how she acquired such a deep feeling for Japanese society at such a young age. Her artistic powers of observation and imagination are proved in this film.The comedy is almost a separate story from the central love interest and springs from the natural friction one encounters in a totally foreign society. The genius of this film is that Coppola displays what is funny to both sides of the cultural gap. My Japanese father-in-law, normally a humorless salary-man type who rarely smiles, burst out laughing most uncharacteristically when he watched this movie. Rarely does humor cross the boundary between English and Japanese, as almost always the important things really are lost in translation. Coppola manages to bridge that gap with hilarious effect.I'm in complete agreement with the other reviewers who have praised this film, only adding that Coppola has done more than create a comedic and romantic masterpiece---she actually manages to do it in a Japanese way.",5,Nothing is Lost in Translation Here,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,2371,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'never', 'impress', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'Western', 'actors', 'film', 'want', 'comment', 'Japanese', 'side', 'where', 'actors', 'also', 'do', 'magnificent', 'job', 'portrayals', 'fit', 'seemlessly', 'heady', 'milieu', 'story', 'amazed', 'way', 'film', 'viewer', 'Tokyo', 'scene', 'so', 'realistically', 'giving', 'one', 'sense', 'cultural', 'vertigo', 'living', 'Japan', 'more', '10', 'years', 'can', 'attest', 'story', 'uncannily', 'feeling', 'sights', 'sounds', 'foreigner', 'experience', 'Japan.I', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'add', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'have', 'managed', 'do', 'something', 'few', 'Western', 'artists', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'do', 'conveying', 'character', 'humor', 'Tokyo', 'story', 'rooted', 'Japanese', 'perspective', 'restrained', 'romance', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlet', 'Johansen', 'style', 'great', 'Japanese', 'literature', 'film', 'comedy', 'central', 'story', 'fleeting', 'relationship', 'immersed', 'sensory', 'whirlwind', 'very', 'much', 'akin', 'stories', 'novels', 'instance', 'Noble', 'laureate', 'Yasunari', 'Kawabata', 'classic', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'theme', 'symbolism', 'film', 'enough', 'establish', 'fact', 'Coppola', 'woven', 'texture', 'beauty', 'sadness', 'love', 'fleeting', 'happiness', 'fabric', 'film', 'Japanese', 'novelist', 'would', 'have', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wondering', 'how', 'acquired', 'deep', 'feeling', 'Japanese', 'society', 'young', 'age', 'artistic', 'powers', 'observation', 'imagination', 'are', 'proved', 'film.The', 'comedy', 'almost', 'separate', 'story', 'central', 'love', 'interest', 'springs', 'natural', 'friction', 'one', 'totally', 'foreign', 'society', 'genius', 'film', 'Coppola', 'displays', 'what', 'funny', 'sides', 'cultural', 'gap', 'Japanese', 'father-in-law', 'normally', 'humorless', 'salary-man', 'type', 'who', 'rarely', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'most', 'uncharacteristically', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'Rarely', 'humor', 'cross', 'boundary', 'English', 'Japanese', 'almost', 'always', 'important', 'things', 'really', 'are', 'lost', 'translation', 'Coppola', 'bridge', 'gap', 'hilarious', 'effect.I', ""'m"", 'complete', 'agreement', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'praised', 'film', 'only', 'adding', 'Coppola', 'done', 'more', 'create', 'comedic', 'romantic', 'masterpiece', '-she', 'actually', 'do', 'Japanese', 'way']",Lost in Translation

That is just what it is - a dizzying, beautiful, and...yes, cool depiction of being lonely in a big city.The story involves an aging, washed up actor, and the young, neglected wife of a fashion photographer.They meet in a Tokyo hotel lounge and hit it off immediately. They laugh, they talk, they seem to fill each others void - seem to understand one another. A lesser movie would quickly turn this into the obligatory romance, but Lost in Translation is more mature. It understands the complexities of the human need for companionship, and that this need works on many more levels than a Hollywood clich&eacute;. This relationship is what makes Lost in Translation so compelling. These two people need each other so deeply, so immediately, in a way that registers to everyone. That need it is something that transcends romance, friendship, acquaintance, and every other box one could place human contact in. Sophia Coppola has captured these nuances and complexities to such a subtle and beautiful tee, that this is a film that stays with you and lingers for days - even weeks - after the first viewing.To top that off, Bill Murray offers his career's best performance. This is an amazing performance, given by a real pro. Murray plays a role that is far more complicated than it appears. He is a funny man, a man who knows he has a natural comedic talent...but has lost something. He no longer feels the need to try so hard...he is holding back. This is an infinitely perceptive Murray and every minute he is on screen, he had my rapt attention.Scarlette Johanason proved to be the only match for Murray minute by minute in this performance that shows that she is quite possibly the next great female lead of my generation.Lost in Translation has amazing staying power and proves to be a real treat for anyone who gives it a chance.",4,Worthy of the buzz,1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,1954,"['Being', 'lonely', 'never', 'felt', 'so', 'cool', 'how', 'one', 'viewer', 'put', 'experience', 'watching', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'words', 'just', 'what', 'dizzying', 'beautiful', 'yes', 'cool', 'depiction', 'being', 'lonely', 'big', 'city.The', 'story', 'aging', 'washed', 'up', 'actor', 'young', 'neglected', 'wife', 'fashion', 'photographer.They', 'meet', 'Tokyo', 'hotel', 'lounge', 'hit', 'off', 'immediately', 'laugh', 'talk', 'seem', 'fill', 'others', 'void', 'seem', 'understand', 'one', 'lesser', 'movie', 'would', 'quickly', 'turn', 'obligatory', 'romance', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'more', 'mature', 'complexities', 'human', 'need', 'companionship', 'need', 'many', 'more', 'levels', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 'eacute', 'relationship', 'what', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'compelling', 'two', 'people', 'need', 'other', 'so', 'deeply', 'so', 'immediately', 'way', 'everyone', 'need', 'something', 'romance', 'friendship', 'acquaintance', 'other', 'box', 'one', 'could', 'place', 'human', 'contact', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'captured', 'nuances', 'complexities', 'such', 'subtle', 'beautiful', 'tee', 'film', 'lingers', 'days', 'even', 'weeks', 'first', 'viewing.To', 'top', 'off', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'career', 'best', 'performance', 'amazing', 'performance', 'given', 'real', 'pro', 'Murray', 'role', 'far', 'more', 'complicated', 'funny', 'man', 'man', 'who', 'natural', 'comedic', 'talent', 'lost', 'something', 'no', 'longer', 'need', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'holding', 'back', 'infinitely', 'perceptive', 'Murray', 'minute', 'screen', 'had', 'rapt', 'attention.Scarlette', 'Johanason', 'proved', 'be', 'only', 'match', 'Murray', 'minute', 'minute', 'performance', 'quite', 'possibly', 'next', 'great', 'female', 'lead', 'generation.Lost', 'Translation', 'amazing', 'staying', 'power', 'be', 'real', 'treat', 'anyone', 'who', 'chance']",Lost in Translation

What I also liked about the movie is that it doesn't fall into the cliche of having the older man embark on a torrid love affair with the much-younger woman; their relationship is of a kind not seen often in movies, an unexpected friendship that has sexual tension in it but goes beyond the physical.  One of the best moments in the movie is at the end, with something whispered from one character to the other that we can only guess at...I was disappointed with the Scarlett Johansson character.  She hits the same note over and over again - she is sort of blank and listless and lifeless.  To her credit, she does the most with what the screenplay gives her, but you're always wanting something more from her character.  Just as you want something more from the movie.  It's interesting to watch the relationship develop, but you always sense that the movie could have done a little more with the characters or given us something more to think about and feel for.  There are some sequences I found utterly shallow (the karaoke sequence, Murray and Johansson's night out running from place to place).  It really feels like the film is treading water.  I know the film is supposed to be more ""atmospheric"", but unlike truly wonderful atmospheric films, there's something about this one that keeps us at a distance, that makes us wonder why we are where we are, and why it is even important for us to watch the characters do what they do.As the setting, Japan is used for the comical and the strange; it's a world where two lost souls can float around and ponder the lack of meaning in their lives.  There is one scene where Johansson visits a temple - what does she think of it? What impact does it have on her? Nothing, it seems.  The country sometimes seems to be little more than a cardboard backdrop, two-dimensional.  Johansson visits a gathering of Japenese women at an ichebana (flower-arranging) lesson.  She walks through the room, brushes her fingers over some flowers, and...? And...?

619802,A17KX1ZH4CIV4T,B00005JMJ4,"Shanea ""existenceseven""","[10, 12]","Any movie goer or video renter, who watches romance dramas or romantic comedies knows that the formula of every mainstream romance is the same: lovers meet, fall in love, usually have great sex, argue, break up, and get back together--and a Natalie Cole song more than likely ""This Will Be"" plays during the end credits. And we all know in reality that love isn't usually like that and meeting people and connecting with people is always a little deeper and more complex. And Sofia Coppola knows this too. Although its sometimes fun to watch random movie stars thrown together, not based on on-screen chemistry but more on reaching broader demographics, go through the trials and tribulations of love and romance. It's also enlightening and even more fun to watch films where two people trapped in their own private miseries bond in a foreign country for a week long odysessy of late night chats at bars, karaoke parties, and strip joints. That's the beauty that Coppola brings in Lost in Translation, a dreamy escape into the unique bond between hotel loners: Bob, an unhappily married, aging movie star in a mid life crisis played with sweet charm by Bill Murray and Charlotte a young wife struggling to find her place in the world played gracefully by Scarlett Johannson. Their connection is so endearing niether of them can explain it and they never dwell on the mechanics of it and Coppola never throws in a cheap Lolita-esque plot twist. The story is really shaped around two lost souls finding comfort in the other's company.Lost In Translation is a love letter to the mysterious ways people find each other in their most needful times and how attraction isn't always centered around sexual desire but perhaps a sense of longing or wonder about the possibilities of ""what if"" and the intimacy of the unsaid.

Unfortunately, the term ""hype"" is probably better attached to your various blockbusters. Imagine the hype over a good story by Chekov?  Normally, in our exploding, flashing entertainment world it isn't going to happen since the bar has been so lowered.  But that's where this story resides, in a land of nuance and quiet space (Bergman territory).  Such craftsmanship places demands on the viewer, just like a well written story places demands on a reader. Bittersweet is very hard to do, but this film pulls if off, right down to the last scene (the whisper was a perfect, hopeful, human touch.)

619805,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00005JMJ4,Shashank Tripathi,"[45, 53]","""Lost in Translation"" joins the rank of surreal films that depict life and emotions with such understated fluidity that they fall short of satiating typical Hollywoodesque tastes. ""About Schmidt"" was one. Coen brothers' ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" was another.There is little I can add to all the other reviews already here, but I'll focus on addressing the various misconceptions that all the encomium surrounding this minimalistic gem from Sophia Coppola (with the usual baggage of expectations) has given rise to:(1) SHOWS JAPAN IN A POOR LIGHT, OR POKES FUN AT THE CULTURENo it doesn't. That sounds like a boorish remark from people who stopped by Tokyo for a couple of days, had Ramen at Ginza and Toro at Shimbashi, sipped a double Latte at Shibuya's Starbucks, and assumed that they had discovered Japanese culture. I still have to see a more accurate rendition of Tokyo's true day-to-day existence than this movie, apart from Tom Selleck's ""Baseball"" a few years back. Yes, the real Tokyo does have mispronounciations of words like ""Flight"" (as in, ""Have a good fright"".) Yes, real translators shorten a good deal of Japanese when interpreting as long as the message is communicated. Most of my Japanese friends would simply laugh along when told of such common trivia. This movie is as much a caricature of Japanese culture as ""Patton"" or ""Sex and the City"" are of American culture. (P.S. Murray's character also has a pretty funny remark in the film in answer to the question, ""Why do Japanese interchange their Rs and Ls?""). The film is mis-sold as being a movie about Japan, the cultural takes are comic garnish, not elemental to the romantic plot.(2) IT IS A MEANINGLESS DRAWL, PACED VERY SLOWSure, if you have the attention span of a rodent in a cheese store. I found the flow of the movie very pleasing, but then I am guilty of enjoying the likes of ""About Schmidt"" as well. It's a simple, beautiful, efficient story that is completely and utterly engrossing, with economy of cinematography. It is also just a shade over 90 minutes long, making it quite short in comparison to typical movies of today. But in that short span of time, you experience a dampening feeling of entrapment, a sense of longing (and belonging), you are privy to the story of two people who are lost spiritually, emotionally, and physically.(3) TRIES TO BE ARTSY AND FAILSWas it artsy? I am not sure. I surely did not feel that it was pretentious. Why can film not mirror our lives and experiences without shocking or over-embelishing, and still be looked at as a remarkable and moving artform? There is a lot in the movie that perhaps may not hit a nerve with people who expect to be hit on the head with meaning. For instance, there is an overhead shot when the two protagonists were in one of their hotel rooms, in bed talking, fully clothed, he is on his back staring at the ceiling, she is on her side, eyes probably closed, the tips of her feet barely touching the side of his leg, and he moves his hand and puts it on her feet. Then the scene fades to black. It is the kind of tender, non-sexual touch that tells us how close they have become, and that theirs is a relationship of mutual trust and admiration, not one necessarily of lust. I guess this is not for everyone to appreciate.(4) NOT THE USUAL FUNNY CAMEO FROM BILL MURRAYNegative. I found Bill Murray to be extremely hilarious in this movie, and while this may sound arrogant, he is funny in a ""mature"" sort of a way. Like a man who doesn't have to try too hard. In fact, one thing that hits you about Coppola's direction is the honesty in the story telling. You will feel the utter frustration that Murray's character must have felt trying to make sense of a photographer giving directions with pidgin English, for instance.(5) IT'S NOT ABOUT ROMANCEPerhaps Titanic was then. The chemistry between the two lead characters in Lost in Translation is very moving, I'd even say it is one of the most wistful, effortless and understanding romances I have seen in a long time in film, the variety only the ilk of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thomson could evoke in an Merchant Ivory production. The very fact that these two characters find themselves groping in the middle of an alien culture brings them together and brings to the surface their similarities -- not only as people, but their similar station in life.(6) THERE'S NO PLOT!Right, there isn't. That's the point. I could sit here for an hour and enlist stunning movies that did not pander to an audience that necessarily needs a ""plot."" It's about a life-changing week in the lives of two people, simple as that. This may or may not work for you.(7) IT'S ALL ABOUT COPPOLA / FEMALE DIRECTOR / ETC.This one is the most inane. Let's talk of the film on its merit, leaving all the heritage behind. I didn't care much about The Virgin Suicides, but I have now come to admire Sophia's talents at synthesizing visual, spatial, and sonic impressions. Oodles for film students to learn from!I adore this glorious masterpiece, and highly recommend it --(1) If you're not expecting a pedestrian American Pie style comedy with situational goofs and gaffes(2) If you enjoy a fluid screenplay, like About Schmidt or Royal Tenenbaums(3) If you want to know the day to day life in Japan, not cultural stereotypes strewn about by populist productions like The Last Samurai(4) If you relish unspoken romances like ""Remains of the Day"", ""A Room with a View"", ""One True Thing"", ""The Road Home""(5) If you, like me, understand why the title is so wickedly clever. It's not just the meaning of language that is ""lost in translation."" It is a simple, pithy statement that beautifully captures the essence of everything that we struggle to ""find""This DVD belongs in any self-respecting library.",5,SWEET DILEMMAS OF LOVE IN THE THROES

619806,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B00005JMJ4,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[22, 26]","Bill Murray masterfully plays Bob Harris, an actor more famous for his car chase scenes in the 1970s than any current endeavor. Harris is jetlagged and bewildered in the eastern city of lights - Tokyo. He is being paid $2million to endorse a Japanese whiskey for print and TV media. His wife is back home in sunny California with their kids, treating her life as a housewife more as a career that's going nowhere rather than a relationship. She is obsessed with redecorating Bob's office and faxes him shelf plans in the middle of the night, sends him carpet samples via FedEx, and berades him on the phone, never once saying she misses or loves him.Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, only married for 2 years to a successful photographer on assignment in Japan.  Her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) is always telling Charlotte how much he loves her, but doesn't show it, He never makes time for her or even acknowledges how lonely she must be. He is surrounded by English-speaking celebrities all day long during his photo-shoots, and Charlotte is utterly isolated in the bustling city of Tokyo, elbow to elbow with people who look different and don't speak her language.Like two tiny light bulbs in a dark room, Bob &amp; Charlotte make eye contact in the hotel's bar. Bob has been perched on the same bar stool for so many hours each evening, his butt print is almost a permanent addition to the bar's decor.Bob &amp; Charlotte instantly connect - truly strangers in a strange land. Both in places they don't want to be without anyone else to talk to. Bob tries connecting with his wife on the phone, but she is more concerned with her kids' eating habits than to listen to her husband who is on the other side of the world.  Charlotte tries calling friends in the states, but they don't hear the utter loneliness in her voice and tell her to &quot;have fun! I've got to go now!&quot;Bob and Charlotte never have to explain their lonliness to one another, they experience it and know it when they see it. Whether they are the only two people in the bar that seem to be thinking instead of just nodding heads, or when they are the two slow-moving people in a speedy river of locals on their way to work, school or an arcade.The unspoken is obvious - in many ways, despite their backgrounds and age difference, they are soul mates. They connect at a level that neither of them has been able to do with their own spouses.  No sexual interludes happen between them, just  a very subtle touch here and there that is much like the non-sexual touch of friendship couples have when they have been together many years and are very close. The angst between them is the most binding force they have.Many lonely scenes penetrate the viewer. Bob goes to the swimming pool at the hotel. On one occasion, a water aerobics class is taking place on the other half of the pool, while Bob is solitary on the other side, swimming laps. In another scene, he is literally the only one there in this gigantic Olympic-size pool - almost like the room was constructed solely for his benefit.Charlotte bounces from sitting in her messy hotel room, staring out the window at the crowded city, filled with millions of people, to taking a train to Kyoto to see the Buddhist monestary, just anything to connect with someone, anyone.Murray is stuck in one insulting photo shoot after another. His Japanese assistant does a less than complete job of translating for him, which makes the assignments that much more miserable.  He is cornered into appearing on a Japanese talk show, whose host is referred to as &quot;the Johnny Carson of Japan.&quot; He finally caves in and agrees to do the show, to find out that the host is more a combinaiton of Elton John and Benny Hill - with a stage set like &quot;Laugh In.&quot;The only thing making his stay in Japan bearable is Charlotte, who takes him out on the town with friends to eat, sing Karaoke or just hang out and smoke.  Even when they are out with Charlotte's friends, they are still alone - it is only when they are alone together that the lonliness subsides.  The two of them sharing their lonliness is enough to give the illusion that they are no longer lonely.Interwoven with the stark scenes of lonliness and human apathy are hilarious cross-cultural scenes, mostly stemming from the language barrier. The city is a city of contrasts. Everyone is so polite, they bow, give gifts and smile a lot, but they are always in a hurry and anxious to make you rush along as well. Lest you oversleep, the blinds automatically open at dawn to accost the hotel guest with the morning sun.This is a great film, but not one to see when you're sleepy or depressed. If you are already feeling lonely, alone, sad or depressed, this movie will be the antithesis of a &quot;pick-me-up&quot; and should be avoided. The long, quiet scenes can lull the very tired into a coma, but this film is a class act.

Should a movie be scaled on how much blood, boobs and Ka-Booms can fit in 100 min, or how much we can think, ponder, or symbolism. If you weigh your opinion based on the first choice, LiT is about the farthest you can get from entertainment, if you happen to favor the latter, then LiT isen't gold, it's darn-near movie platinum. But if you appreciate both, like me, and want a healthy balance of both, LiT is like a fat-girl with a beautiful personality. If it was in a prettier, flashier body, it'd be your number one pick.Symbolism, especially in movies, is a double-edged sword, and when it comes to it, most people have a destinct mark of love or hate. LiT is considered a modern masterpeice when it comes to allegories, it has deep themes concerning alienination, culture shock and finding yourself, and all are vibrant throughout. The movie fills it's reel by showing a more serious Bill Murray and the ever so talented Scarlett Johansson exploring these themes so beautifully, meekly and passionatly that it does make you wonder how this could get any better... or if it can put you to sleep faster than NyQuil can. If you think of figurative language less as an art and more as BS, then you would see LiT as two average, boring people living their average boring lives, and we get to see them live it for 100 min. If symbolism isen't your cup of tea, steer far away from what is potentialy a snore-fest.When it comes to me and my tastes, I need a little of both sides.

I won't add another synopsis here when other reviewers have done it so well before and Amazon explain the general premise in their product description. I agree with other reviewers who state that the beauty in this film derives from the smallest touch or glance between Charlotte and Bob rather than from an in-depth, convoluted plot line. Or it comes from the music (by Kevin Shields) that perfectly compliments the feelings of separation from the characters own lives and from the city they are exploring together, or from the fact that Coppola manages to deliver a film that is both poignant and entertaining without ramming any messages down your throat like most Hollywood films are inclined to do. I tend to feel Bill Murray has rarely acted better than in this film and saying that, the same applies to Scarlett Johannsson, both play their roles superbly with just the right amount of humour and seriousness to lend it credibility. The film feels more ethereal and unreal as it progresses due to the characters prolonged jet lag and insomnia and their intense personal connection amidst the confusion of Tokyo and it is this element that I'm sure loses and gains it many fans. It is also infused with that sense of delicious melancholy you can sometimes feel, without making you feel sad or low. Bob and Charlotte's friendship quickly develops until, in a seeming contradiction, it is very much a romantic plutonic relationship and it is this aspect of the film that sustains it when it could feel too slow or spaced out, as it keeps your interest engaged. If you come to this film expecting a Hollywood all action blockbuster you will disappointed, but if you come to this expecting a unique and brief snapshot of two peoples lives as they spend time together learning about themselves and each other, then you should enjoy this to the full and see what all the hype is about.

The Ten Commandments, for example, may have had stupid parts, but the viewer never loses interest. It reaches out and grabs you. The same is true with the Star Wars series. You may hate them but you can never get bored with them. They reach out and grab you.Lost in Translation is a movie in which you have the absolute reverse situation. You have to reach out and grab the movie if you are attempting to understand the point. You'd probably have to watch this movie several times even. This movie is NOT funny. It is NOT dramatic. It does NOT have a message. It is NOT entertaining and it is NOT even interesting.Bill Murray plays a 50 something actor in Tokyo who is on a losing streak. He meets Charlotte who is 25 years old played by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson and the two fall in love. That's about it for the plot. Automatically, I have no sympathy for the characters since Bill Murray is old enough to be the grandfather of the girl he's supposed to fall in love with and looks utterly ridiculous, as does Scarlett Johansson. His character DESERVES to be a loser and I hoped the two lovebirds would have a SAD ending at the end of the movie.In the words of John Belushi, what ever happened to the Bill Murray I used to know??? I mean the Bill Murray who brought the house down as the funny soldier on ""Stripes"", the Bill Murray who played the clown who robbed the bank on ""Quick Change"", or the Bill Murray who made people laugh playing the mental patient who made Richard Dreyfus, the psychiatrist, a mental patient himself in ""What About Bob""? Perhaps he's ""Lost in Translation""! Please, somebody FIND him!Even worse is this movie's style. It shifts from one pointless scene to another. All we really see are different areas of Toyko. Why make a movie? Why not just advertise Tokyo on the Travel Channel showing these scenes?Ladies and Gentlemen: This is as bad as it gets! This movie is one of the worst movies this year and is also the most overrated movie in recent memory. Sofia Coppola and company do not deserve one penny of your money.

The idea is genius, I think.  But for some it isn't all that great and it's easy to see why for some.  But some movies I go see for the soul purpose of enjoying it.Perhaps the reason why not so many seem to like it here is because of all the hype.  It happens to the best of movies that receive a lot of hype (The Matrix Reloaded comes to mind). Lost In Translation DID receive a lot of hype, with an oscar nominee for Best Picture, Director, Actor and Screenplay, it generated a lot of hype and made a lot of people want to go out and see this movie. Well, hype tends to disappoint people and so I tried to view the movie with as litle expectations as possible, and to my surprise, it worked.Bill Murray plays a man named Bob Harris who flies off to Toyko to shoot a commercial.  His wife and kids are back in a America while he goes to Toyko to shoot this commercial. Scarlet Johansen plays the wife of a world-wide photographer who is in Toyko on business.The two meet in a bar in Toyko and soon become friends. Perhaps what really IS interesting about the movie is their age difference. Bill Murray is a middle-aged man and Scarlet Johansen is young.  So the chemistry is in fact odd.The characters are stale though.  We don't learn much about them and actually that symbolizes just what the movie IS. Both of our protagonists are lonely mentally and that's what &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; is all about.Then there's the plot... well the movie doesn't really have a plot.  However, a movie doesn't have to present a plot to be good. As long as the story unfolds in a believeable and interesting way, it can more than make up for the lack of an actual plot.My gripes with the movie. I may not live in Toyko but it seems the movie is full of stereotypes!  The fact that they show Japanese as not being able to speak as well of English and the whole bit about them not being as tall as westerners is nothing but stereotypes!  I don't mind that they joked around but its the fact that well...the movie wasn't really funny at all.  They call this a comedy but its not.Lost in Translation isn't a bad movie, it's just been given to much hype which utterly ruins the experience of the movie.

Bob happens to be a millionaire who commands popularity and acceptance in Japan.  He is living in two worlds where he is striving to meet the needs of his employer, and that of his wife and family back home in the states.  He meets a college graduate named Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johansson) who also happens to be married and is accompanying her successful photographer husband to Japan. Charlotte plays a woman who loves her husband, but is also in the process of finding her professional role in life.  Charlotte's husband cares for her tremendously, but is unable to spend as much time with her as he would like due to work commitments.  Charlotte and Bob cross paths and end up being temporary friends in Japan.  They explore the various clubs and hangouts in Tokyo with their friends.  I do believe that this film had a strong story because it covers the universal themes of how essential it is to create a plan on where you want to go in life, and to creatively construct new plans  if and/or when setbacks occur.  For Charlotte she is only experiencing a temporary setback of pinpointing where she intends to professionally in her life. For Bob, he is doing fine professionally but he too is setting a new intention in his life (except more in his family arena).  I liked watching this film because it brought back some positive memories I had of  when I was living in Japan (via the U.S. military) during the time period of September 2000 until October 2003.

619825,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B00005JMJ4,Stephen A. Haines,"[4, 7]","The relative difficulty of writing tragedy or comedy has long been debated among dramatists. Sofia Coppola here takes the unusual step of combining the two through Bill Murray.  Famed for his comedy roles, in this film his ability to convey subdued emotions resulting in a poignant story suffused with ironies.  He's an actor brought to Tokyo to make adverts for Suntory whiskey.  The shooting of the advert, a high point in the film, gives Murray full opportunity to express feelings.  Photo sessions, however, don't occupy much time.  With days of lonely leisure time confronting him, Tokyo's hectic scene leads him to find solace in the hotel bar.  There, he encounters a young blonde woman.We've [indirectly] already met her.  Coppola vividly sets the tone of this film - loneliness - with the opening scene.  A girl's anonymous figure might suggest romance or even something erotic.  Her slow movements, however, convey a mood of solitude, strongly reinforced the next time we see her.  Scarlett Johansson plays a young wife in a strange land, her photographer husband on an assignment.  Johansson, clearly young enough to be Murray's daughter, captures his attention across the bar.  What follows should be entirely predictable, but Coppola's abilities prevent her falling into such a trap.Over the ensuing days, Murray and Johansson develop a liaison - of sorts.  Johansson is clearly dissatisfied with her situation.  A recent philosophy graduate, she has no view of her future. Several wordless scenes of her wandering in Tokyo set her role flawlessly - a wedding in a Buddhist temple is superbly portrayed.  Johansson wanders, almost aimlessly, her growing despair palpable.  She is seeking something greater than what she has, but is Murray the answer?  She's carefully restrained in her dealings with the urbane actor.  She attracts him without leading him on nor promising anything.  The tension in this relationship builds superbly under Coppola's deft touch.  There is nothing formula in her use of close-ups and with Murray and Johansson, she's able to convey mood with deceptively minimal views.Coppola provides an intensely human drama in this superbly photographed story.  In moving the setting to Tokyo, she declares her independence from the grim stereotype of ""romantic comedy"" almost universally set in New York City.  Her story [Coppola both wrote and directed this gem] is even more mould-breaking.  Dialogue is minimised as Coppola uses Murray's expressiveness and Johansson's pensive beauty to define the story.  This approach is far from superficial in her hands.  With no doubt attraction is building throughout the story, we  wonder 'is it love?'.  Both married, both alone - in the hands of an inept director or vapid script, every scene would be predictable.  Here, however, surprises abound, none as cataclysmic as the conclusion.

The answers are simple:Sofia Coppola has made an incredible love movie for the new millenium that doesn't pander to very contemorary cliche, involve sex (well, almost) or deal with accepted romance standards.  And what she made was something more fluid and romantic then anything I've seen for years in movies.  While this movie isn't a vast, complicated plot or filled with actiony sequences utilizing amazing effects, it does what any film has to in order to succeed- tell a story that can involve an audience.Kudos to all involved.  It is a stunningly accurate, and obviously live, version of Tokyo.  Being there twice, I can relate to the sounds, the people, the design, and anything in this great visual ode to one of the most amazing cities in the world.  Having studied Japanese for the last 18 months, I can understand some of the dialogues and understand why the east and west has such a gap that could create this relationship/story.  Most amazing is the small detail of the 'Dr. Who Sci Fi' hum of machinery within cooridors and buildings that masks a constant noise of choatic human activity just beyond the walls of any room.  And more evidently, the story of miscommunication and alienation within a world in your face, yet emotionally beyond your reach is relayed brilliantly.This film will grow with the Japophile, and be a sweet romance to anyone unfamiliar with the idea of being segregated within a society they can't relate to.  But, it will keep me thinking because of the sweet relations between the two lead characters as they find and lose the loves of their life within the confines of Tokyo.",5,Quite a good movie!,1075766400,"02 3, 2004",2004,1742,"['So', 'read', 'reviews', 'luke', 'warm', 'glowing', 'back', 'shamefully', 'bashing', 'little', 'more', 'then', 'confusing', 'answers', 'are', 'simple', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'made', 'incredible', 'love', 'movie', 'new', 'millenium', ""n't"", 'pander', 'very', 'contemorary', 'cliche', 'involve', 'sex', 'well', 'almost', 'deal', 'accepted', 'romance', 'standards', 'what', 'made', 'was', 'something', 'more', 'fluid', 'romantic', 'then', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'movies', 'movie', ""n't"", 'vast', 'complicated', 'plot', 'filled', 'actiony', 'sequences', 'utilizing', 'amazing', 'effects', 'what', 'film', 'order', 'succeed-', 'tell', 'story', 'can', 'involve', 'audience.Kudos', 'involved', 'stunningly', 'accurate', 'obviously', 'live', 'version', 'Tokyo', 'Being', 'twice', 'can', 'relate', 'sounds', 'people', 'design', 'anything', 'great', 'visual', 'ode', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'cities', 'world', 'Having', 'studied', 'Japanese', 'last', '18', 'months', 'can', 'understand', 'dialogues', 'understand', 'why', 'east', 'west', 'gap', 'could', 'create', 'relationship/story', 'Most', 'amazing', 'small', 'detail', ""'Dr"", 'Who', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'hum', 'machinery', 'cooridors', 'buildings', 'masks', 'constant', 'noise', 'choatic', 'human', 'activity', 'just', 'walls', 'room', 'more', 'evidently', 'story', 'miscommunication', 'alienation', 'world', 'face', 'yet', 'emotionally', 'reach', 'relayed', 'brilliantly.This', 'film', 'will', 'grow', 'Japophile', 'be', 'sweet', 'romance', 'anyone', 'unfamiliar', 'idea', 'being', 'segregated', 'society', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'will', 'keep', 'thinking', 'sweet', 'relations', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'find', 'lose', 'loves', 'life', 'confines', 'Tokyo']",Lost in Translation
619827,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B00005JMJ4,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[23, 39]","I am a fan of indie films, so I'm not just biased against the genre.  I really do think this film is boring and stupid!  The concept is wonderful, the acting is as it should be, the chemistry is there, the setting is atmospheric - and director Sofia Coppola, like some kind of indie George Lucas, takes great material and just pulverizes it!!!  I don't care whose daughter she is, she is just proving that the only thing worse than her acting is her directing!  I guess film talent ISN'T hereditary!OK, now that I've gotten the ugliness out of me, I'll try to stay objective.  I really wanted to like this movie - I like the actors, and the idea of a platonic love developing between two displaced Americans was a wonderful concept to me!  I just wish the film had spent more time developing that instead of the lingering shots of Scarlett sitting at the window, or Bill sitting at the bar just looking bored.  I wish there were less lingering shots of Scarlett walking down this street and then that street and then sitting on a bus, then at a cafe, then in the bath-tub!  Any half-competent director can establish in about three or four shots that these characters are lonely and depressed!What I wanted more of was actual connecting dialogue, some hint of character development.  Instead, once the two FINALLY meet after about thirty minutes, you get a quip from Bill, a laugh from Scarlett, then a ""see ya round,""  Shampoo, rinse, repeat for about 70 minutes . . . annnnd scene!  So what happens in the end?  Are they in love?  Are they going to see each other again?  Has anything about them changed?  No, all we have is a movie that succeeds in only ONE thing - making the viewer feel as bored as the characters.I for one am sick and tired of independent films like this one getting praised up and down when there are so many good ones out there that are much more worth a watch!  Want a good indie night?  Go rent THE DAYTRIPPERS, CLOCKWATCHERS, and MEMENTO for starters!  And, for a MUCH, MUCH better look at the amazing Scarlett Johanson, check out GHOST WORLD, THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, and GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING - GHOST WORLD even has some nice jabs at just this type of overblown, art-house filmmaking!  Give this one a pass - don't let the critics make you feel less cultured and stupid just because you expect a plot and a story progression for your money!Best Picture?!?  God forbid!One last thing - the marketers, realizing how boring this movie is as a drama, thought it would be more effective to sell it to the unsuspecting public as a comedy!  WRONG AGAIN!  There is nothing funny in this movie beyond some wry and ironic moments that, frankly, thrive only on racial ignorance of Japanese culture and their inabilities to pronounce ""L's and R's"" properly - yep, the humor is THAT sophisticated!!  I thought we were a living in a more culturally advanced society - but if I were Japanese, I would have been offended at the portrayal.",1,"One of those ""you're stupid if you don't 'get it'"" movies!!",1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,2956,"['am', 'fan', 'indie', 'films', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'biased', 'genre', 'really', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'boring', 'stupid', 'concept', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'should', 'be', 'chemistry', 'there', 'setting', 'atmospheric', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'kind', 'indie', 'George', 'Lucas', 'great', 'material', 'just', 'pulverizes', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'daughter', 'just', 'proving', 'only', 'thing', 'worse', 'acting', 'directing', 'guess', 'film', 'talent', ""N'T"", 'hereditary', 'OK', 'now', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'ugliness', ""'ll"", 'try', 'stay', 'objective', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'like', 'actors', 'idea', 'platonic', 'love', 'developing', 'two', 'displaced', 'Americans', 'was', 'wonderful', 'concept', 'just', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'developing', 'instead', 'lingering', 'shots', 'Scarlett', 'sitting', 'window', 'Bill', 'sitting', 'bar', 'just', 'looking', 'bored', 'wish', 'were', 'less', 'lingering', 'shots', 'Scarlett', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'then', 'street', 'then', 'sitting', 'bus', 'then', 'cafe', 'then', 'bath-tub', 'half-competent', 'director', 'can', 'establish', 'about', 'three', 'four', 'shots', 'characters', 'are', 'lonely', 'depressed', 'What', 'wanted', 'more', 'was', 'actual', 'connecting', 'dialogue', 'hint', 'character', 'development', 'Instead', 'once', 'two', 'FINALLY', 'meet', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'get', 'quip', 'Bill', 'laugh', 'Scarlett', 'then', 'see', 'ya', 'round', 'Shampoo', 'rinse', 'repeat', '70', 'minutes', 'annnnd', 'scene', 'So', 'what', 'end', 'Are', 'love', 'Are', 'going', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'Has', 'anything', 'changed', 'No', 'have', 'movie', 'only', 'ONE', 'thing', 'making', 'viewer', 'feel', 'as', 'bored', 'characters.I', 'one', 'am', 'sick', 'tired', 'independent', 'films', 'one', 'getting', 'praised', 'down', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'ones', 'there', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'worth', 'watch', 'Want', 'good', 'indie', 'night', 'Go', 'rent', 'THE', 'DAYTRIPPERS', 'CLOCKWATCHERS', 'MEMENTO', 'starters', 'MUCH', 'MUCH', 'better', 'look', 'amazing', 'Scarlett', 'Johanson', 'check', 'out', 'GHOST', 'WORLD', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'THERE', 'GIRL', 'WITH', 'A', 'PEARL', 'EARRING', 'GHOST', 'WORLD', 'even', 'nice', 'jabs', 'just', 'type', 'overblown', 'art-house', 'filmmaking', 'Give', 'one', 'pass', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'critics', 'make', 'feel', 'less', 'cultured', 'stupid', 'just', 'expect', 'plot', 'story', 'progression', 'money', 'Best', 'Picture', 'God', 'forbid', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'marketers', 'realizing', 'how', 'boring', 'movie', 'drama', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'sell', 'unsuspecting', 'public', 'comedy', 'WRONG', 'AGAIN', 'nothing', 'funny', 'movie', 'wry', 'ironic', 'moments', 'frankly', 'thrive', 'only', 'racial', 'ignorance', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'inabilities', 'pronounce', 'L', 'R', 'properly', 'yep', 'humor', 'sophisticated', 'thought', 'were', 'living', 'more', 'culturally', 'advanced', 'society', 'were', 'Japanese', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'offended', 'portrayal']",Lost in Translation
619828,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B00005JMJ4,Steve,"[2, 4]","It is fascinating the love/hate opinion most have for this movie. It garners either five stars or one star and yet I find myself somewhere in the middle. Director Sophia Coppola breezes us through Japan, be it to witness the traditional wedding in Kyoto, dashing through the Pachinko parlors, singing karaoke, walking through shrines and temples, eating in local restaurants, riding the trains, the shabu shabu restaurant, the propaganda vans shouting their messages as they drive down the street, the ladies handing out tissue packages on the street, the often bizarre Japanese tv shows, and so, so much, this movie is at times a loving home movie for me, reminding me of so much I have seen and done during my time in Japan. For that reason alone I find myself watching it now and again just to remind me of the country that I miss so much now that I am back in the states.Many people have complained of the anti-Japanese sentiment. I think they are missing the point, however. The two characters, Bob in particular, are very real clich&eacute;s of the ugly American. Rather than taking Coppola to task for making fun of Japanese people, I give her credit for showing us ourselves. The squeamishness and outrage we feel when we see these characters is purposeful. Lord knows I came across many such people in my years there and seeing this behavior in the characters made them very real to me. Furthermore, Bob's acidic attitude is symptomatic of the misery and sadness he is experiencing and the frustration that stems from such feelings which causes him to seek the most convenient scapegoats for his angst.In the end, though, most of the complaints stem from the viewers being bored to death and I will agree that there is little that really happens in this movie. It reminds me in some ways of ""Sideways,"" both character studies where we visit with flawed and problematic people. I will also admit that before I lived in Japan I watched this movie and it wasn't nearly the same experience as it was after seeing Japan in person. It changed so much of my understanding and appreciation of the film.One of the things that did bug me some was the near perverse nature of the relationship. Charlotte is young enough to be his daughter and their wavering feelings of longing for each other didn't serve the plot in any real way. The tenderness and humanity of the film could've been accomplished with a more realistic father-daughter connection between the two. I understand that they are desperate and needy for anyone to give them some shelter from their misery. But again, I think that this point could've been made without the sexual tension. Being lonely, being sad, and needing someone to cling to during difficult times in our life need not be sexual.There is a scene about two-thirds through the movie where the two characters exchange thoughts on life, mostly Bob dispensing wisdom to Charlotte. This is my favorite part because we see the crystallization of what these two mean to each other. After days and nights suffering through jet lag, these two sleep-deprived foreigners finally fall blissfully asleep because at last they realize they are not alone amid the neon chaos of Tokyo. Charlotte nestles close in the security of her new friend and Bob gently touches Charlotte's foot and anchors himself for that moment to allow sleep to come. It's a subtle and tender moment and there are enough of these moments in Lost in Translation for me to forgive some of the mistakes. This is not a perfect movie but I give Coppola a lot of credit for making this most unusual and off-beat film.",3,A tender if not always successful film,1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,3599,"['fascinating', 'love/hate', 'opinion', 'most', 'have', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'one', 'star', 'yet', 'find', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'Director', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'Japan', 'be', 'witness', 'traditional', 'wedding', 'Kyoto', 'dashing', 'Pachinko', 'parlors', 'singing', 'karaoke', 'walking', 'shrines', 'temples', 'eating', 'local', 'restaurants', 'riding', 'trains', 'shabu', 'shabu', 'restaurant', 'propaganda', 'vans', 'shouting', 'messages', 'drive', 'down', 'street', 'ladies', 'handing', 'out', 'tissue', 'packages', 'street', 'often', 'bizarre', 'Japanese', 'tv', 'shows', 'so', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'times', 'loving', 'home', 'movie', 'reminding', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'seen', 'done', 'time', 'Japan', 'reason', 'alone', 'find', 'watching', 'now', 'again', 'just', 'remind', 'country', 'miss', 'so', 'much', 'now', 'am', 'back', 'states.Many', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'anti-Japanese', 'sentiment', 'think', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'however', 'two', 'characters', 'Bob', 'particular', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'ugly', 'American', 'Rather', 'taking', 'Coppola', 'task', 'making', 'fun', 'Japanese', 'people', 'give', 'credit', 'showing', 'squeamishness', 'outrage', 'feel', 'when', 'see', 'characters', 'purposeful', 'Lord', 'came', 'across', 'many', 'such', 'people', 'years', 'there', 'seeing', 'behavior', 'characters', 'made', 'very', 'real', 'Furthermore', 'Bob', 'acidic', 'attitude', 'symptomatic', 'misery', 'sadness', 'experiencing', 'frustration', 'such', 'feelings', 'seek', 'most', 'convenient', 'scapegoats', 'angst.In', 'end', 'though', 'most', 'complaints', 'stem', 'viewers', 'being', 'bored', 'death', 'will', 'agree', 'little', 'really', 'movie', 'ways', 'Sideways', 'character', 'studies', 'where', 'visit', 'flawed', 'problematic', 'people', 'will', 'also', 'admit', 'lived', 'Japan', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'same', 'experience', 'was', 'seeing', 'Japan', 'person', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'understanding', 'appreciation', 'film.One', 'things', 'did', 'bug', 'was', 'near', 'perverse', 'nature', 'relationship', 'Charlotte', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'daughter', 'wavering', 'feelings', 'longing', 'other', 'did', ""n't"", 'serve', 'plot', 'real', 'way', 'tenderness', 'humanity', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'accomplished', 'more', 'realistic', 'father-daughter', 'connection', 'two', 'understand', 'are', 'desperate', 'needy', 'anyone', 'give', 'shelter', 'misery', 'again', 'think', 'point', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'made', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Being', 'lonely', 'being', 'sad', 'needing', 'someone', 'cling', 'difficult', 'times', 'life', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'sexual.There', 'scene', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'where', 'two', 'characters', 'exchange', 'thoughts', 'life', 'mostly', 'Bob', 'dispensing', 'wisdom', 'Charlotte', 'favorite', 'part', 'see', 'crystallization', 'what', 'two', 'mean', 'other', 'days', 'nights', 'suffering', 'jet', 'lag', 'two', 'sleep-deprived', 'foreigners', 'finally', 'fall', 'blissfully', 'asleep', 'last', 'realize', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'neon', 'chaos', 'Tokyo', 'Charlotte', 'nestles', 'close', 'security', 'new', 'friend', 'Bob', 'gently', 'Charlotte', 'foot', 'anchors', 'moment', 'allow', 'sleep', 'come', 'subtle', 'tender', 'moment', 'are', 'enough', 'moments', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'forgive', 'mistakes', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'give', 'Coppola', 'lot', 'credit', 'making', 'most', 'unusual', 'off-beat', 'film']",Lost in Translation

This is a film that needs to be experienced rather than watched.  It does not rely on a conventional narrative to impress.  Instead, it triumphs by immersing the viewer in a sea of captivating sensation.Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an American celebrity who heads to Japan to do some work as a commercial spokesperson.  Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a young woman who has come to Japan because of her husband's business assignment.  Both Bob and Charlotte feel a sense of isolation in the foreign land but find comfort in each other's company.  A strong bond develops between them as they try to place their lives in perspective.  When it becomes time to part ways, both Bob and Charlotte find it emotionally difficult to say goodbye to one another.In ""Lost in Translation,"" Bill Murray follows in the footsteps of Robin Williams and proves that he is capable of so much more than straightforward comedy.  His splendid and nuanced performance anchors the film and gives it its essence and soul.  Similarly, Johansson further cements her claim as one of the more exciting young actresses working today by bringing to life a character possessed of an insight and wisdom far beyond that typical of women her age.  Watching Bob and Charlotte come to terms with their lot in life is a wonderful and touching event to witness.  Coppola distinctly imposes her own identity on ""Lost in Translation"" by following her own creative insights instead of mimicking the broader and more dramatic style of her father.

Fuji is barely visible from Tokyo so you do the math. neither Bob nor Charlotte spoke Japanese, which becomes an issue outside of Tokyo proper. two side trips that really didn't serve the movie in a meaningful way and seemed like orphaned scenes.i know many viewers feel this movie rings true to being a tourist -- simply put being concious of being foreign. i agree and gave this movie three stars but i felt that the overall issue of cultural displacement, the path of the movie and the dialogue were all done in a more effective way in the movie Barcelona.",3,mistranslation,1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,2272,"['good', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'what', 'i', 'thought', 'were', 'odd', 'problems', 'ok', 'just', 'odd', 'me.the', 'movie', 'centers', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'hollywood', 'actor', 'now', 'prime', 'who', 'Japan', 'doing', 'whisky', 'commercial', 'easy', 'money.arriving', 'Tokyo', 'jetlagged', 'blinks', 'high', 'tech', 'pulse', 'city', 'reminded', 'bit', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'electronic', 'ads', 'very', 'surface', 'problem', 'verbal', 'translation', 'horrendously', 'bad', 'translator', 'dialogue', 'director', 'commmerical.finding', 'refuge', 'nightclub/lounge', 'posh', 'hotel', 'eye', 'Charlotte', 'Scarlett', 'Johanson', 'newlywed', 'photographer', 'assignment', 'Japan', 'feels', 'displaced', 'husband', 'never', 'around', 'emotional', 'anchor', 'Tokyo', 'plea', 'friend', 'start', 'movie', 'describing', 'going', 'shrine', 'feeling', 'nothing', 'quickly', 'disassociation.Bob', 'Charlotte', 'quickly', 'develop', 'affinity', 'other', 'being', 'Americans', 'Japan', 'more', 'likely', 'are', 'adrift', 'relationships', 'term', 'mind.i', 'am', 'reminded', 'moments', 'own', 'trip', 'Japan', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'many', 'familiar', 'places', 'kinship', 'felt', 'visitors', 'foreign', 'land', 'other', 'foreign', 'tourists', 'are', 'things', 'definitely', 'jarring', 'seem', 'implausible.how', 'Charlotte', 'who', ""n't"", 'work', ""'sophisticate"", 'can', 'afford', 'posh', 'hotel', 'assignment', 'photographer', 'day', 'Kyoto', 'wherever', 'Bob', 'teed', 'off', 'are', 'unlikely', 'Kyoto', ""n't"", 'easy', 'navigate', 'lose', 'four', 'hours', 'just', 'sitting', 'shinkansen', 'meanwhile', 'Mt', 'Fuji', 'barely', 'visible', 'Tokyo', 'do', 'math', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'spoke', 'Japanese', 'issue', 'Tokyo', 'proper', 'two', 'side', 'trips', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'serve', 'movie', 'meaningful', 'way', 'seemed', 'orphaned', 'scenes.i', 'know', 'many', 'viewers', 'feel', 'movie', 'true', 'being', 'tourist', 'simply', 'put', 'being', 'concious', 'being', 'foreign', 'i', 'agree', 'gave', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'i', 'felt', 'overall', 'issue', 'cultural', 'displacement', 'path', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'were', 'done', 'more', 'effective', 'way', 'movie', 'Barcelona']",Lost in Translation

Unlike what some people here have said, I have indeed traveled abroad, have found myself alone in a foreign country, and I don't live in ""middle America,"" I live in New York City and I see plenty of art house films. And yet I still didn't get this film. Go figure.Why? There's very little character development. I couldn't see why Bob and Charlotte were drawn together. Their relationship didn't evolve at all. You can do character development with very little dialogue and without tons of plot if you know what you're doing, which the director obviously didn't. Bob's phone calls to his wife were much more interesting than his interactions with Charlotte  because they illustrated the problems in their marriage. Charlotte's call to her friend at home was insightful, as well.If you want a sweet movie that features two characters coming together and forming a bond, watch Garden State. Like this one, it was beautifully shot and has good music, but unlike this film, you could actually see the characters developing. If you want a film about unrequited love with very understated acting, rent The Remains of the Day with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.Bill Murray is great in this, but he's still doing the same dry schitck he's been doing for 30 years. Scarlett Johansen was great, too. They just didn't have much to work with. Also, tangents would start and then be dropped. Charlotte's photographer husband didn't want her to come to dinner with him and his ex-girlfriend. Was he planning cheating on her or what?? I don't mind understated films, but loose ends are another thing.On the upside, this film did look gorgeous; some of the shots were composted beautifully. The music was good, as well. And I was very, very thankful that Bob and Charlotte never slept together.

619838,A3UI51KFK0TKWQ,B00005JMJ4,TA152H,"[8, 11]","I bought this movie immediately after seeing it on cable, as I thought it was superb.  It has nothing to do with the hype, I had never heard of the movie before I watched it.  I figured it would be seen as simple and boring, because most people would not get it.  I was pleasantly surprised that so many people did.  Not all though.Some people like to complain about racism and other nonsense like that, because they do not understand it.  If it was racist, it was against the human race.  Everyone outside of those two were portrayed badly, not just the Japanese.  There is the American actress who is superficial and phoney beyond belief, the husband who is also part of that superficial crowd that has nothing important to say, the wife that really cares nothing about her lonely husband in Japan and just wants to get off the phone, and the Japanese who are a mixture of bizarre, stupid, and annoying.  This has nothing to do with being misanthropic or racist, it makes the movie work better.  They are more alone in that they are sensible, if flawed, but everyone else is not.  This moves them closer, no one else can reach them.The interesting thing about this movie is that it is so realistic, while at the same time being entirely unrealistic.  Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) are very real, and their interactions are very witty and insightful, but everyone else is more surrealistic and part of the environment, rather than real people.  When real people are in totally unrealistic situations, the results can either be horrible or wonderful.  In this case, they are wonderful because they are handled so honestly by the actors in the bizarre situation.  There is a scene where a woman is translating Japanese to English, for example, and the Japanese version is much, much longer than what is said in English.  It is totally absurd and unrealistic the difference is so great, but Bill Murray's handling of it is so perfect and honest, it works beautifully.  There are several scenes just like this, with the scenery actors doing their jobs as totally unrealistic people, and Bob and Charlotte reacting to them.This movie is not about romantic love at all, but about companionship.  Having someone you can relate to.  This is one of the reasons it had to happen somewhere foreign (boosts the we versus they aspect of a relationship like this) and the necessity of bizarre people around them.  The age difference does not matter, it is not about that type of relationship.  What it is about is done very well, and never seems forced, fake or obtuse.  It really works well.I really like this movie a lot, but it is a bit esoteric and may not appeal to everyone.  Well, obviously it does not.  It is a funny movie, but in a subtle way, and not everyone goes for that.  Also, it is not exactly an action packed movie, and the plot is not as clear as it is in some movies where things are linear and the purpose of each scene becomes immediately obvious.  This is just about the developing relationship between two lonely people stuck in a foreign country who meet.  If it seems impossible for this to be entertaining to you, it probably will not be.  However, if you think you could be interested in it, I think you will enjoy it tremendously.  It is done so well.",5,"Unusual, honest and interesting.",1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,3291,"['bought', 'movie', 'immediately', 'seeing', 'cable', 'thought', 'was', 'superb', 'nothing', 'do', 'hype', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'watched', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'simple', 'boring', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'did', 'Not', 'though.Some', 'people', 'complain', 'racism', 'other', 'nonsense', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'was', 'racist', 'was', 'human', 'race', 'Everyone', 'two', 'were', 'portrayed', 'badly', 'not', 'just', 'Japanese', 'American', 'actress', 'who', 'superficial', 'phoney', 'belief', 'husband', 'who', 'also', 'part', 'superficial', 'crowd', 'nothing', 'important', 'say', 'wife', 'really', 'nothing', 'lonely', 'husband', 'Japan', 'just', 'get', 'off', 'phone', 'Japanese', 'who', 'are', 'mixture', 'bizarre', 'stupid', 'annoying', 'nothing', 'do', 'being', 'misanthropic', 'racist', 'movie', 'work', 'better', 'are', 'more', 'alone', 'are', 'sensible', 'flawed', 'everyone', 'else', 'not', 'closer', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'reach', 'them.The', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', 'so', 'realistic', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'entirely', 'unrealistic', 'Bob', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Charlotte', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'interactions', 'are', 'very', 'witty', 'insightful', 'everyone', 'else', 'more', 'surrealistic', 'part', 'environment', 'rather', 'real', 'people', 'When', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'situations', 'results', 'can', 'either', 'be', 'horrible', 'wonderful', 'case', 'are', 'wonderful', 'are', 'handled', 'so', 'honestly', 'actors', 'bizarre', 'situation', 'scene', 'where', 'woman', 'translating', 'Japanese', 'English', 'example', 'Japanese', 'version', 'much', 'much', 'longer', 'what', 'said', 'English', 'totally', 'absurd', 'unrealistic', 'difference', 'so', 'great', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'handling', 'so', 'perfect', 'honest', 'beautifully', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'just', 'scenery', 'actors', 'doing', 'jobs', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'people', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'reacting', 'them.This', 'movie', 'not', 'romantic', 'love', 'companionship', 'Having', 'someone', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'reasons', 'had', 'happen', 'somewhere', 'foreign', 'versus', 'aspect', 'relationship', 'necessity', 'bizarre', 'people', 'age', 'difference', 'not', 'matter', 'not', 'type', 'relationship', 'What', 'about', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'never', 'forced', 'fake', 'obtuse', 'really', 'well.I', 'really', 'movie', 'lot', 'bit', 'esoteric', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'Well', 'obviously', 'not', 'funny', 'movie', 'subtle', 'way', 'not', 'everyone', 'Also', 'not', 'exactly', 'action', 'packed', 'movie', 'plot', 'not', 'as', 'clear', 'movies', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'linear', 'purpose', 'scene', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'just', 'developing', 'relationship', 'two', 'lonely', 'people', 'stuck', 'foreign', 'country', 'who', 'meet', 'impossible', 'be', 'entertaining', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'However', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'interested', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'tremendously', 'done', 'so', 'well']",Lost in Translation

With &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; the sights and sounds of Tokyo, Japan, are incredible, along with a stunningly beautiful actress, Scarlett Johansen (Charlotte), and a quirky actor, Bill Murray (Bob). This light-hearted comedy of a wayward man lost in the midst of a bustling metropolis--and the Japanese language--along with the bored wife of a photographer, makes for a humdrum movie. The actual movie takes a backseat to the special features on the DVD. The film's crew encountered adversity head-on overcoming incredible odds: With an impending Japanese typhoon, dealing with horrendous pedestrian/vehicular traffic, and the city's language barriers, they accomplished a great deal during the filming of the movie in spite of the extraordinary circumstances beyond their control.Happenstance was abound in this film in which an older man and a young woman meet at the Park Hyatt Hotel, in a nice restaurant overlooking the city, surrounded by the incredible ambiance of friendly people, classical music, lights, lights, and more lights.I was very disappointed that Bob and Charlotte's relationship didn't evolve like I'd hoped. There was more talk and less action between the two. I'm wondering why they didn't shack-up at the hotel? Anyhow, I didn't think this was Bill Murray's best work as he purported it as being.

619842,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B00005JMJ4,Takis Tz.,"[20, 35]","Unlike those who went to see &quot;Lost in translation&quot; because of the ridiculous hype created mostly by the critics, i went to see it because mostly everyone i know who'd seen it was telling me &quot;unless you're looking for a good 2 hours of sound sleep, don't go&quot;..I decided to find out for myself why there were conflicting &quot;reports&quot; about this film. I rarely trust the &quot;critics&quot; but rarely doesn't mean never.Well, I would have to think and think hard at that, to remember another film which was so hyped and amounted to so much nothingness. Adding more to the mystery is that this thing even won awards.To keep things short, this is a surreally uninspired script, which employs 2 otherwise very good actors who in turn spend two hours delivering some of the most boring lines i've heard in a long time on film. Supposedly this is an intellectual comedy (now THAT's a joke) but in that case the joke must be on the audience. I found myself grinning a coupla times and basically that was it. Cheap jokes about how the Japanese mispronounce English isn't exactly what i deem &quot;intellectual&quot; for one thing, and for another, tired semi-pick up lines over whiskey doesn't cut it for &quot;humour&quot; as far as I'm concerned either..And all this despite being positively biased because i happen to be a big fan of Murray's..&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; attempts to take a quirky look at two people &quot;trapped&quot; in a mega-lux hotel in Tokyo who while seeing their marriages falling apart are also seeing their lives becoming epmtier and emptier and devoid of &quot;meaning&quot;. What they do about that is wander about hopelessly, meet in the hotel bar, down some drinks and then some more, wander again, meet in the hotel bar and toos back some more drinks and have some seriously empty conversations in the process.Uhm, is this supposed to be &quot;deep&quot; or something and if yes in exactly what kind of circles does this pass as deep? Or is it supposed to be &quot;touching&quot; as some other people claimed? Touching? Christ, if all flirting was THAT boring there'd eventually be a law against it.There was also this other line of argument from people who said that this film is good because of the stark contrast it provides to most of the mindless Hollywood films out there. Ok, I'd be willing to entertain such a noble notion, but this would mean that this film is not mindless. Which it's not, but just because a film raises the IQ bar a mere few points over the general mediocrity it doesn't mean that it automatically becomes intelligent. Lost in Translation wants to be intelligent but it can't. There's no adequate story for the film to &quot;stand&quot; onto and there's no clear premise that this joke of a script has.I was watching J.Murray in this film thinking that he actually performs good in it because he perfectly reflects the atmosphere of the film: boredom beyond salvage. Yes, he outdoes the audience being bored, but he had an easier job than us. We didn't have to wait hours on set just to say pseudo-intellectual script-lines. If any other actor had been in his place he'd be forced to perform just as good because &quot;Lost in Translation would give him no other choice but look and act bored to utter tears.Now, more generally speaking, why would i care about some woman (to whom we are given no depth at all) who's  bored because her photographer husband is running about on business leaving her all alone in this lux hotel. I mean, the poor thing!!!! How humdrum!!! Or a millionaire actor with a midlife crisis who's about to cash in a cool two-mill for spending a week in this hotel? I'd take the boredom for that and i wouldn't even expect any mercy from the ones around me if you know what i mean. How could you possibly identify with such paper-thin characters? Totally beyond me...Lost in Translation will sadly enter way high on the list for one of the most overhyped films in recent memory. And immediately after that it will also proudly enter the list as one of the most mediocre films to win awards in recent time. And then, it will slowly but surely head for oblivion...",1,Bored to oblivion...,1085097600,"05 21, 2004",2004,4170,"['who', 'went', 'see', 'quot', 'Lost', 'translation', 'quot', 'ridiculous', 'hype', 'created', 'mostly', 'critics', 'i', 'went', 'see', 'because', 'mostly', 'everyone', 'i', 'know', 'who', ""'d"", 'seen', 'was', 'telling', 'quot', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', '2', 'hours', 'sound', 'sleep', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'quot', '..I', 'decided', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'were', 'conflicting', 'quot', 'reports', 'quot', 'film', 'rarely', 'trust', 'quot', 'critics', 'quot', 'rarely', ""n't"", 'mean', 'never.Well', 'would', 'have', 'think', 'think', 'hard', 'remember', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'hyped', 'amounted', 'so', 'much', 'nothingness', 'Adding', 'more', 'mystery', 'thing', 'even', 'won', 'awards.To', 'keep', 'things', 'short', 'surreally', 'uninspired', 'script', '2', 'otherwise', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'who', 'turn', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'delivering', 'most', 'boring', 'lines', 'i', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'long', 'time', 'film', 'Supposedly', 'intellectual', 'comedy', 'now', 'THAT', 'joke', 'case', 'joke', 'must', 'be', 'audience', 'found', 'grinning', 'coupla', 'times', 'basically', 'was', 'Cheap', 'jokes', 'how', 'Japanese', 'mispronounce', 'English', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'i', 'deem', 'quot', 'intellectual', 'quot', 'one', 'thing', 'tired', 'semi-pick', 'lines', 'whiskey', ""n't"", 'cut', 'quot', 'quot', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'being', 'positively', 'biased', 'i', 'happen', 'be', 'big', 'fan', ""Murray's.."", 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'attempts', 'take', 'quirky', 'look', 'two', 'people', 'quot', 'trapped', 'quot', 'mega-lux', 'hotel', 'Tokyo', 'who', 'seeing', 'marriages', 'falling', 'apart', 'are', 'also', 'seeing', 'lives', 'becoming', 'epmtier', 'emptier', 'devoid', 'quot', 'meaning', 'quot', 'What', 'do', 'wander', 'hopelessly', 'meet', 'hotel', 'bar', 'down', 'drinks', 'then', 'more', 'wander', 'again', 'meet', 'hotel', 'bar', 'toos', 'back', 'more', 'drinks', 'have', 'seriously', 'empty', 'conversations', 'process.Uhm', 'supposed', 'be', 'quot', 'deep', 'quot', 'something', 'yes', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'circles', 'pass', 'deep', 'supposed', 'be', 'quot', 'touching', 'quot', 'other', 'people', 'claimed', 'Touching', 'Christ', 'flirting', 'was', 'boring', 'there', ""'d"", 'eventually', 'be', 'law', 'it.There', 'was', 'also', 'other', 'line', 'argument', 'people', 'who', 'said', 'film', 'good', 'stark', 'contrast', 'most', 'mindless', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'Ok', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'entertain', 'such', 'noble', 'notion', 'would', 'mean', 'film', 'not', 'mindless', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'IQ', 'bar', 'mere', 'few', 'points', 'general', 'mediocrity', ""n't"", 'mean', 'automatically', 'intelligent', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'be', 'intelligent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'adequate', 'story', 'film', 'quot', 'stand', 'quot', 'clear', 'premise', 'joke', 'script', 'has.I', 'was', 'watching', 'J.Murray', 'film', 'thinking', 'actually', 'good', 'perfectly', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'boredom', 'salvage', 'Yes', 'audience', 'being', 'bored', 'had', 'easier', 'job', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'hours', 'set', 'just', 'say', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'script-lines', 'other', 'actor', 'had', 'been', 'place', ""'d"", 'be', 'forced', 'perform', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'would', 'give', 'other', 'choice', 'look', 'act', 'bored', 'utter', 'tears.Now', 'more', 'generally', 'speaking', 'why', 'would', 'i', 'care', 'woman', 'whom', 'are', 'given', 'depth', 'who', 'bored', 'photographer', 'husband', 'running', 'about', 'business', 'leaving', 'alone', 'lux', 'hotel', 'mean', 'poor', 'thing', 'How', 'humdrum', 'millionaire', 'actor', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'who', 'cash', 'cool', 'two-mill', 'spending', 'week', 'hotel', ""'d"", 'take', 'boredom', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'expect', 'mercy', 'ones', 'know', 'what', 'i', 'mean', 'How', 'could', 'possibly', 'identify', 'such', 'paper-thin', 'characters', 'Totally', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'will', 'sadly', 'enter', 'way', 'high', 'list', 'one', 'most', 'overhyped', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'immediately', 'will', 'also', 'proudly', 'enter', 'list', 'one', 'most', 'mediocre', 'films', 'win', 'awards', 'recent', 'time', 'then', 'will', 'slowly', 'surely', 'head', 'oblivion']",Lost in Translation

It was a tedious experience, to say the least.I'm not going to describe what happens in the film, but I will say that my first impression of ""Lost in Translation"" after watching it for only half hour was that Bill Murray wanted to make a movie in Japan.  Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but consider this:  There's an upside and a downside to everything.The upside is that there are no car explosions, flying monkeys, no interglactic arks transporting shipments of minerals through deep space, no aliens blowing holes through buildings, and no Whoopie Goldberg.  Afterwards, you can impress other people by telling them that ""Lost in Translation"" is truly cinematic art, and that something this good was never meant for the masses!  Good stuff for all us culture vultures!The downside is is that there are no car explosions, flying monkeys, no interglactic arks transporting shipments of minerals through deep space, no aliens blowing holes through buildings, and no Whoopie Goldberg.  Anything would have livened this film up... Honest!  What does happen is that we get to see one establishing shot after another of Bill Murray mugging his way through Japan and getting himself into one forgettable situation after another. Yow!I guess if you like that sort of thing, ""Lost in Translation"" is for you.  The last movie I saw that I would compare ""Lost in Translation"" to is Adam Sandler's ""Punch Drunk Love"".To be honest, if I were a Japanese citizen, I wouldn't know what to think of ""Lost in Translation"", but I sure wouldn't be flattered by it.  As of this counting, there are about 1800 reviews of the ""Lost in Translation"" dvd on Amazon.com (or 1801 if you count mine).  Out of 1800, 565 reviewers gave this movie one star.  That's 31 percent who didn't like anything about the movie and were highly irritated at having spent two hours watching it.If you take the time to scroll through the lowest ratings, you'll notice review titles like ""Racist!"", ""Boring, Boring, Boring"", ""Don't waste your time or money"", ""Worst Movie ever"".

There is no other word to describe &quot;Lost In Translation&quot;, the somber journey of two lonely people who become friends in the neon lights of Tokyo while they kill time until they can return home to the US. Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this gem, and she has created a quiet, sublime film that gets the point across not through endless chatter, but poignant dialogue that only comes out when it needs to. There is much in her style that comes from her famous father, but she makes it into her own, and she is unbelievably good at it. This is her second film, and it is even better than &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, which was also an exceptional film. She will be a force to be reckoned with on the film scene for years to come, as she has an undeniable talent.Much has to be said about the acting in this movie, because the performances from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen are top-notch. Murray was nominated for an Oscar for this performance, and it is much deserving, because it is the best of his long career. The fact that Johanssen was not nominated is a travesty, but she is only 18 and has a long, promising career in front of her. Both of them work so well together, taking advantage of the simply written script and making the most out of every delicious line and nuance that Coppola has put into her work. The third major character in this movie has to be the city of Tokyo itself, and the director captures it and its strangeness perfectly.I reccommend this movie to everybody, and I look forward to seeing more from Coppola, as she deserves all the accolades that she is receiving for this movie.",5,The new Coppola genius,1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,1651,"['movie', 'brilliant', 'other', 'word', 'describe', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'quot', 'somber', 'journey', 'two', 'lonely', 'people', 'who', 'become', 'friends', 'neon', 'lights', 'Tokyo', 'kill', 'time', 'can', 'return', 'home', 'US', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'wrote', 'directed', 'gem', 'created', 'quiet', 'sublime', 'film', 'point', 'not', 'endless', 'chatter', 'poignant', 'dialogue', 'only', 'out', 'when', 'much', 'style', 'famous', 'father', 'own', 'unbelievably', 'good', 'second', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'quot', 'was', 'also', 'exceptional', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'film', 'scene', 'years', 'come', 'undeniable', 'talent.Much', 'be', 'said', 'acting', 'movie', 'performances', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'are', 'top-notch', 'Murray', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'much', 'deserving', 'best', 'long', 'career', 'fact', 'Johanssen', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'travesty', 'only', '18', 'long', 'promising', 'career', 'front', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'taking', 'advantage', 'simply', 'written', 'script', 'making', 'most', 'delicious', 'line', 'nuance', 'Coppola', 'put', 'work', 'third', 'major', 'character', 'movie', 'be', 'city', 'Tokyo', 'director', 'strangeness', 'perfectly.I', 'reccommend', 'movie', 'everybody', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'Coppola', 'accolades', 'receiving', 'movie']",Lost in Translation

The movie does not particularly progress from here, other than to try to offer up a &quot;slice of life&quot; as these two sometimes hang out, other times don't, in a strange land.The film is carried by a spot-on Bill Murray, who could not look more weary and subtley sarcastic in this film, the charismatic Scarlett Johansson, and the sensory overload of Tokyo itself. Tokyo provides a lot of material for Murray and Johansson to work off of, and they do it well. Though you do not laugh out loud much, the movie does enjoy a great chuckling sense of humor throughout, and a genuine heart in the shared emptyness of Murray and Johansson contrasted with the pounding insistence of Tokyo.  There is no true plot, just a slight joy in sharing this unusual experience with the characters. Not everyone will like this movie, and if you choose not to invest yourself in the characters, you will bored senseless. But it is a film that can be rewarding.So it was packaging in a sterling example of &quot;what not to do on a DVD.&quot; 1. Do NOT force people to watch previews (though an onscreen message says you can fast forward through, pressing &quot;MENU&quot; in fruitless. If they are reminded people they can fast forward, they obviously know we don't care about the previews, right? So why torment us?). 2. Please, for the love of God, put some real special features on there.

Scarlett Johansson is Ivy league-educated Charlotte, who's tagging along with her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) and has too much free time on her hands.  Both Bob and Charlotte are bored out of their skulls, unfulfilled, and cross paths in downtown Tokyo.  This could have been the premise for a great romance, expect that director Sophia Coppola gives little reason to care about either the characters or their predicaments.  Not to mention that this movie drags and drags with not much in the way of a plot.  But &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; isn't a total bust.  Murray and Johansson do the best they can with the material they have to work with, and cinematographer Lance Acord deserves props for filming the city of Tokyo so beautifully.  And while this film does have its share of laughs (most of which, it must be said, are at the expense of the Japanese, who are made to look like fools), you can't help but notice that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is an average movie that's pretty empty at its core.

It's an embarrassment! I don't even know where to begin, but let's start with the characters and their relationships with each other:Scarlett Johanssen is married to her husband for how long at the beginning of this movie: a month or two? And yet, not only are they not getting along, but they literally HATE EACH OTHER and have NOTHING IN COMMON. And they act like they didn't know each other before getting married... she is upset at his interests, he feels that she is too materialistic. Perhaps I'm naive, but I don't buy it. I have heard that this is based on Coppola's relationship with (better) director Spike Jonze, and if so, I think the bitterness in her heart has gotten in the way of honest, effective storytelling.The character who is supposedly based on Cameron Diaz is more of the same - bland, one-dimensional, bitter attacks from a writer/director who is more hateful than skilled.Moving past that, though -- Coppola's attempts at humor. I went into this movie knowing that Japanese people were, on average, shorter than Americans, and would speak English with an accent. But Coppola seems to think that this is some kind of a revelation. Over the length of the movie, almost every single joke relates to this. And after the director has made dozens and dozens of references to Japanese characters mixing up their ""l""s and ""r""s, she has the audacity to have Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen actually TALK about the foriegners' propensity to do this. Sorry, I'm not impressed.As for Bill Murray's character, he comes off as the most likable simply because Murray is incapable of delivering a bad performance, but he seems fairly poorly developed, and there's never much of a reason that he and Scarlett Johanssen fall in love except that they seem to be the only two remotely sane English-speaking people in this incarnation of Japan -- maybe I'm not seeing something, but that seems like an inadequate reason.Oh, and of course she throws in a scene in a Karaoke bar. You know, because the Japanese love Karaoke. You have to give it to this director, she's original.So, in summary, I found this movie to be fairly irredeemable, an ""indie"" version of the terrible romantic comedies I see 100 times a year, and only ""indie"" by virtue of the couple's scant personalities and motives for falling in love with each other, which I suppose some audiences mistakened for complexity of character.

I think that it's strengths lie in its cinematography and art direction.  Also, I found the dialogue to be subtle, understated, nuanced, and compelling.Other than that, the movie did not really impress me.  First off, this film falls into the genre of ""Emo-type Americans who travel to a non-English speaking country and try to `find themselves.'""  What usually happens is that world-weary protagonists travel to foreign countries where they are unable to communicate with the native population because they are not able to speak the language of the country they are visiting (in this case Japanese).  Thus, the native population comes off as mysterious and inscrutable, their customs strange and exotic, and their culture beautiful but ultimately unknowable.  This irreconcilable gulf between the protagonists and the native population helps to highlight and symbolize the alienation and isolation that the protagonist feels toward the rest of humanity.  It also leads to many humorous scenes when the protagonists are arbitrarily thrown into disorienting and/or stereotype-reinforcing situations, such as a protagonist finding himself taller than the rest of the Asian men in an elevator, or a protagonist being beset by an E.S.L. prostitute who no doubt caters to all sort of deviant sexual fantasies for the native men, fantasies that the foreign protagonist cannot begin to fathom.  The movie is beautifully shot, full of soul, and the dialogue and interactions between characters ring true to life.  The problem is that the movie falls into this whole obnoxious genre of a stranger in a strange land.  It is the film's only flaw, but it is fatal to the integrity of the movie.Both Murray and Johansson burn brightly in their respective roles.  Giovanni Ribisi delivers a brilliant performance as a preoccupied and distant husband.  Even Anna Faris makes an endearing appearance as a vapid, giggly blonde starlet shooting a Matrix-like action flick in Tokyo.  Not surprisingly, none of the Japanese characters are in any way developed.  (This, of course, would entail treating the Japanese characters as actual three-dimensional people instead of movie props, a possible complicating dynamic that Coppola is never in danger of broaching.)  Despite the skillfully executed performances, the actors and actresses still far short of the Herculean task of animating this lifeless material.If you want a more satisfying film based on the same themes of lonely people finding each other in a cold and indifferent world, watch the British classic, ""Brief Encounter"" written by Noel Coward and directed by David Lean.  Instead of taking the easy way out and giving his character passports to an exotic and distant destination somewhere in the British Empire, Coward makes the decisive choice to couch the entire film in drab suburban England.  The sense of estrangement he creates is all the more heightened precisely because he doesn't flinch from the unrelenting loneliness and seclusion that one can find in the mundane and trivial setting of one's own home and community.",2,"Like Ex-President Ford: Nothing Bad, But Sadly Unimpressive",1084406400,"05 13, 2004",2004,3116,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'dislike', 'movie', 'se', 'think', 'strengths', 'lie', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'Also', 'found', 'dialogue', 'be', 'subtle', 'understated', 'nuanced', 'compelling.Other', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'impress', 'First', 'off', 'film', 'genre', 'Emo-type', 'Americans', 'who', 'travel', 'non-English', 'speaking', 'country', 'try', 'find', 'What', 'usually', 'world-weary', 'protagonists', 'travel', 'foreign', 'countries', 'where', 'are', 'unable', 'communicate', 'native', 'population', 'are', 'not', 'able', 'speak', 'language', 'country', 'are', 'visiting', 'case', 'Japanese', 'Thus', 'native', 'population', 'off', 'mysterious', 'inscrutable', 'customs', 'strange', 'exotic', 'culture', 'beautiful', 'ultimately', 'unknowable', 'irreconcilable', 'gulf', 'protagonists', 'native', 'population', 'highlight', 'symbolize', 'alienation', 'isolation', 'protagonist', 'feels', 'rest', 'humanity', 'also', 'many', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'when', 'protagonists', 'are', 'arbitrarily', 'thrown', 'disorienting', 'and/or', 'stereotype-reinforcing', 'situations', 'such', 'protagonist', 'finding', 'taller', 'rest', 'Asian', 'men', 'elevator', 'protagonist', 'being', 'beset', 'E.S.L', 'prostitute', 'who', 'doubt', 'caters', 'sort', 'deviant', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'native', 'men', 'fantasies', 'foreign', 'protagonist', 'can', 'not', 'begin', 'fathom', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'full', 'soul', 'dialogue', 'interactions', 'characters', 'ring', 'true', 'life', 'problem', 'movie', 'whole', 'obnoxious', 'genre', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'film', 'only', 'flaw', 'fatal', 'integrity', 'movie.Both', 'Murray', 'Johansson', 'burn', 'brightly', 'respective', 'roles', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'preoccupied', 'distant', 'husband', 'Even', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'endearing', 'appearance', 'vapid', 'giggly', 'blonde', 'starlet', 'shooting', 'Matrix-like', 'action', 'flick', 'Tokyo', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'none', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'are', 'way', 'developed', 'course', 'would', 'entail', 'treating', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'actual', 'three-dimensional', 'people', 'instead', 'movie', 'props', 'possible', 'complicating', 'dynamic', 'Coppola', 'never', 'danger', 'broaching', 'skillfully', 'executed', 'performances', 'actors', 'actresses', 'still', 'far', 'short', 'Herculean', 'task', 'animating', 'lifeless', 'material.If', 'want', 'more', 'satisfying', 'film', 'based', 'same', 'themes', 'lonely', 'people', 'finding', 'other', 'cold', 'indifferent', 'world', 'watch', 'British', 'classic', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'written', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'directed', 'David', 'Lean', 'Instead', 'taking', 'easy', 'way', 'giving', 'character', 'passports', 'exotic', 'distant', 'destination', 'somewhere', 'British', 'Empire', 'Coward', 'decisive', 'choice', 'couch', 'entire', 'film', 'drab', 'suburban', 'England', 'sense', 'estrangement', 'more', 'heightened', 'precisely', ""n't"", 'flinch', 'unrelenting', 'loneliness', 'seclusion', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'mundane', 'trivial', 'setting', 'one', 'own', 'home', 'community']",Lost in Translation
619853,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B00005JMJ4,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[9, 15]","And """"little"" is the word here (and that's a compliment), because Sofia Coppola, God love her, sees the world in small details. Lost in Translation is a tiny film with some big ideas. Coppola has a gift for taking what could be cliched situations and avoiding every possible cliche. She sees the possibilities of everything afresh. And she's never heavy-handed about it.That last may surprise some people, who see the film as one long, drawn out exercise, and it's easy to see how one could get that impression at first. But repeated viewings shows a lot of subtlety in the arrangement of details and the order in which the story progresses, and after a while you see she needed every element that ends up in the film. If anything is cut, the relationship between Charlotte and Bob would have been too fast, or we would not have seen that this is not a story about two lovers cheating on their respective spouses but two people who aren't being listened to by their spouses and who are adrift in a strange place. It's interesting that there is nothing prurient or titillating in this film. There are no gratuitous shots of Scarlett Johansson's physical assets, nobody ever curses, not even a ""damn,"" and the one brief scene in a strip club is only there to show how neither of the principles feels comfortable in such an environment.LiT is actually a fairly puritanical film. I'm surprised no critic has yet noted there's not a single curse word in this film--it would be rated G if not for the almost gratuitous scene in the strip club. Charlotte and Bob share their intimacies fully clothes, lying on the bed, in the daylight. They don't have sex--not even a hurried grope or a leering glance. Why they need each other is bigger than sexual gratification, although in their last night together, you can see on their faces for the first time longing that goes beyond mere comradeship. (The hotel singer helps by croaking, ""I'm so into you"" in the background.) ""Don't leave. Stay here with me and we'll start a jazz band,"" Charlotte tells Bob when he says he doesn't want to go home the next morning. These are the things we say when we are far from home and responsibility: it's easy to fantasize about starting a new life, beginning fresh. But watch the gaze on their faces fade ever so slightly, as their real lives come back into focus in their minds. They know it's just fantasy, a common fantasy, and that is why they can't do it, but they never say this. It's these tiny moments of truth where Sofia Coppola has no peer in film.Much has been made of the fact that she has a powerful daddy behind the scenes, implying that maybe her success is due less to her talents than to the name she carries with her. While it's impossible to deny the benefit of dropping the name Coppola when making a phone call or trying to get something done, there's also no denying that she can deliver the goods; she is a completely original voice. It's interesting that I never hear critics discount Jason Reitman, director of Thank You For Smoking, Juno and Up In The Air (all excellent films, btw) just because he's the son of Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters). But Sofia Coppola is fair game for sniping. She couldn't be doing all this on her own, could she? Yes she can, and I've got news for anyone who doesn't believe it: she's a major voice in the same way that Godard, Bogdanovich, Truffaut and Antonioni were--all filmmakers she cites as influences.She has absorbed the central lesson of film, something even a George Lucas or a Steven Spielberg, lauded for their ""visual acumen,"" haven't as fully grasped: it's about pictures. Never does she tell something in words when she can show it with mise-en-scene (pardon me for using such a pretentious film school term, but really nothing else does the job). The characters here or in any of her movies never tell the story. We figure the story out through what they do and what they (and we) observe. That's movies at their purest. And if she has to occasionally invoke the holy name of Coppola to create unique moments like she does, then more power to her.Bill Murray has stated this is his favorite film of his, and the ""bed scene"" is the scene he is most proud of. With justification. What a beautifully-simple idea: get them in bed together, and have them do something far more important and memorable than engage their genitals: they talk. About the most important things in life: marriage and children and growing up and figuring out what you're meant to do in life. I love the fact that neither really solves their crisis by the end of the film, but having the other person there made things easier. I love the fact that neither Bob's wife (voiced over the phone with great expressivity by costume designer Nancy Steiner) nor Charlotte's husband was a ""bad"" person, just someone in a different orbit. This is a movie about life. It's not a Hollywood film with a Hollywood ending, and that's probably what threw a lot of people who came to it with preconceptions about how such a film ""ought"" to go. As Roger Ebert so correctly observed, so many films tell you how you're supposed to feel, through music and editing and subtle costume and hair choices. LiT is more grown-up than that. And for that reason this is my favorite film of the entire last decade.That isn't to say LiT is perfect. There are too many scenes where they try to get laughs out of the way Japanese people speak English. I don't mind a little un-PC humor, and people who don't like where they are are going to react more strongly to their strange environment, but after a while the I-don't-get-what-they're-saying schtick wears thin. The comedy of LiT is the least interesting part of the film for me. In fact I hesitate to call this a comedy, and it certainly isn't one in the way most people will expect.But there's so much to like that this complaint is relatively minor. So far my favorite film of the current decade is probably Somewhere, a subtle little miracle of a film directed by...Sofia Coppola. So she's batting 2 for 2 so far. I think she's probably the best director working today. I can hardly want to see what her next project is.",5,A little miracle of a film,1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,6158,"['little', 'word', 'here', 'compliment', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'God', 'world',

619856,A1X6M6IINHDSRC,B00005JMJ4,Thor,"[5, 6]","I have seen many reviews about Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation. Some called it fantastic, beautiful, unforgettable, a masterpiece... Others called it boring, lost and a forgettable film. When I saw the film for the first time myself I was thrilled by the feeling it gave me, it grabbed me for sure. But still I could understand both sides: this film touches you or doesn't effect you at all.The story, written by Sofia Coppola herself (which she won an Academy Award for), is a story that follows two totally different persones. First there is Bob, an actor who comes to Tokyo to film a commercial for a brand of wiskey. Secondly there is Charlotte, the wife of a workaholic who just travelled along with her husband. Now these two characters both have their own problems fitting in the gigantic city's way of life and basically feel lost. When they meet each other on a night at the local hotel bar, a friendship develops and they decide to explore Tokyo together.Now this story leaves you either cold or touches you deep inside.The way the story is filmed is simple but very effective. The camerawork is fantastic and the locations are wonderful. Tokyo is a colourful background that gives the film certain lighting and most of all: atmosphere. This element makes the film extremely powerful. It is like Coppola said herself: she wants you to feel like you have been in Tokyo after watching the film. The atmosphere definitely makes it feel like that. It makes you feel like you are right there walking  next to the characters which is a very effective way to tell a story. Now the people who disliked the film probably had problems keeping their attention with the film because they couldn't feel that atmosphere or simply disliked it because there basically doesn't happen very much.The actors, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson, both give fantastic performances. Bill Murray is absolutely funny and does a great job portraying his character. You see exactly how he feels about something without him saying anything: the expressions on his face say it all.Scarlett Johanson also does a great job and brings, together with Murray, the film to life. The chemistry is perfect between the two which gives fantastic scenes.Lost in translation is a film without any action, without tense situations, without special effects: it simply shows a week of two people their lives who try to escape boredom in a place where there is difficulty to understand each other. If you are looking for a film with explosions, fights, thrills etc, you have to look some place else then Lost in Translation. But do you love dramas, atmospheric films with some humour sprayed on top of it: Lost in Translation is a film for you to see. After watching it for a second time you will see that there is so much you didn't see the first time while watching the film. It definitely grows on you.Sofia Coppola has proved that you don't need a lot to make a great film. With simple but very effective storytelling she has made an absolutely delicious atmospheric film that is a must-see for sure.One of the best atmospheric films I have ever seen.",4,Sofia Coppola Delivers a Film that is Definitely Not Lost,1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,3122,"['have', 'seen', 'many', 'reviews', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'called', 'fantastic', 'beautiful', 'unforgettable', 'masterpiece', 'Others', 'called', 'boring', 'lost', 'forgettable', 'film', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'thrilled', 'feeling', 'gave', 'grabbed', 'sure', 'still', 'could', 'understand', 'sides', 'film', ""n't"", 'effect', 'all.The', 'story', 'written', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'story', 'two', 'totally', 'different', 'persones', 'First', 'Bob', 'actor', 'who', 'Tokyo', 'film', 'commercial', 'brand', 'wiskey', 'Secondly', 'Charlotte', 'wife', 'workaholic', 'who', 'just', 'travelled', 'along', 'husband', 'Now', 'two', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'problems', 'fitting', 'gigantic', 'city', 'way', 'life', 'basically', 'feel', 'lost', 'When', 'meet', 'other', 'night', 'local', 'hotel', 'bar', 'friendship', 'decide', 'explore', 'Tokyo', 'together.Now', 'story', 'cold', 'touches', 'deep', 'inside.The', 'way', 'story', 'filmed', 'simple', 'very', 'effective', 'camerawork', 'fantastic', 'locations', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Tokyo', 'colourful', 'background', 'film', 'certain', 'lighting', 'most', 'atmosphere', 'element', 'film', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'Coppola', 'said', 'herself', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'Tokyo', 'watching', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'definitely', 'feel', 'feel', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'walking', 'next', 'characters', 'very', 'effective', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'Now', 'people', 'who', 'disliked', 'film', 'probably', 'had', 'problems', 'keeping', 'attention', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'feel', 'atmosphere', 'simply', 'disliked', 'basically', ""n't"", 'happen', 'very', 'much.The', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johanson', 'give', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'absolutely', 'funny', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'something', 'saying', 'anything', 'expressions', 'face', 'say', 'Johanson', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'brings', 'together', 'Murray', 'film', 'life', 'chemistry', 'perfect', 'two', 'fantastic', 'scenes.Lost', 'translation', 'film', 'action', 'tense', 'situations', 'special', 'effects', 'simply', 'week', 'two', 'people', 'lives', 'who', 'try', 'escape', 'boredom', 'place', 'where', 'difficulty', 'understand', 'other', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'explosions', 'fights', 'thrills', 'etc', 'have', 'look', 'place', 'else', 'then', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'do', 'love', 'dramas', 'atmospheric', 'films', 'humour', 'sprayed', 'top', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'film', 'see', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'will', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'first', 'time', 'watching', 'film', 'definitely', 'you.Sofia', 'Coppola', 'proved', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'lot', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'simple', 'very', 'effective', 'storytelling', 'made', 'absolutely', 'delicious', 'atmospheric', 'film', 'must-see', 'sure.One', 'best', 'atmospheric', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",Lost in Translation

Instead, writer/director Sofia Coppola's humor is frequently so deadpan and understated, that if you're not paying strict attention (which I wasn't after the first hour), you will miss some of the film's funnier moments.Murray's character is a tragicomic character, isolated in a foreign land without family or friends and both loving and hating it. Scarlett Johannsen's character brings some interest to the film, although her character's relationship with her on-screen husband (Giovanni Rubisi) is sadly underdeveloped, and the film ends on a note of ambivalence, not unlike my feelings towards the film.While there is obviously some cross-cultural and situational humor, most is worthy of only a momentary chuckle. In fact, the entire theme of the film seems moodily subdued, as if the entire cast and crew of the film secretly had its water drugged with a depressant. The film itself is comedy on valium, and while it was a diverting and entertaining viewing experience with a few subtle messages on relationships and fame, I cannot understand the Oscar nominations.

Mostly, what I appreciate in a movie is good writing. Acting and cinema photography help but, in my opinion, cannot carry a movie. The nighttime photography was rather compelling but it made me want to visit Tokyo about as much as Potterville (which it rather resembled.)This just might have made a good book, however. The thoughts and feelings of the three primary characters could have been presented (in a book) in such a way that the reader would have a different impression of them than was obtained from the movie: indifference. I neither liked nor disliked any of the main characters and felt no more involved in their lives than I would to the guy next to me at the airport after having listened to one end of his cell phone conversation.This book/movie comparison works both ways. One of my all-time favorite books is &quot;Catcher in the Rye.&quot; I have felt like I have known Holden Caufield all of my life.

Yet it is strangely effective and gets you in. Probably the reason for that is that the subject matter of the film is treated with a subtly unusual in American films. It is not about the easy resolution of longings by a happy ending. It is more like the 1930's British film Brief Encounter which was about two people who meet on a train station and develop a deep affection for each other. An affection which can never go anywhere as they are both committed to their families.In this film Scarlett Johanson plays a young woman who is coming to the realisation that she has married an idiot. Bill Murray plays an actor who has passed the peak of his career and faces the part of his life which is all downhill. Their brief friendship develops as a result of their alienation from the strange world of contemporary Japan they find themselves in.The film is funny but in a less frantic way than Murray's usual films. Some of the gags are close to objectionable with some ancient routines about Japanese being short, obsessed with business cards and the like. However others simply work.

619865,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B00005JMJ4,Traveler,"[5, 8]","Ever since this film was released I've observed people arguing about its value.  Frankly, none of it mattered to me that much.  I was curious to see what the fuss was about, but not really that motivated to actually go and see ""Lost"" in the theater or even rent it for that matter.Now, after seeing this film, I am fascinated by not just the movie, but also all these negative reviews!Most movies give you two hours which are a super hyper-condensed version of reality.  In many cases this creates an absurd pacing.  Humans and events just don't evolve that quickly.  But audiences, particularly here in the US, demand immediate emotional satisfaction.  The boy always gets the girl, the Americans always win the battle, the bad guy always loses, etc. etc.  This kind of plot and pacing is not just unrealistic, it's absolutely monotonous.  So many movies in the US are just the same thing over and over and over.And then a movie like ""Lost in Translation"" comes along.  Coppola slows the pacing so that it's more realistic. She refuses to pander to the expectations of an American audience.  She wants to show us what it actually feels like to be an observer in another country that you don't understand.  To add to the realism and surrealism she throws in multiple characters who are also having the same experience.  All of this is the context surrounding an unconsummated love between a younger woman and an older man.I'm more saddened than amazed at the hostility towards this film.  To understand ""Lost"" you need to empathize with the characters.  You need to know that uneasy sense of alienation when you're in another country and don't a have a clue about what's going on around you.  More importantly, you need to know what it's like to be committed to someone else and meet another person you would really really like to get to know under different circumstances.Most Americans don't even have passports.  More and more, Americans on all sides of the political spectrum demand news and media that conform to their point of view.  Empathy has become a rare commodity.  All of this, it seems, results in a lot of people just not getting a movie like ""Lost.""

Toss in American Rhapsody's up-and-comer Scarlett Johansson, doing her standard &quot;like, duh&quot; face. Dip them both into emotional torpor in the sleek Park Hyatt, add local color, stir. Et voil&agrave;: Lost in Translation.For Sofia Coppola, this must have been the easiest pitch in the world -- which is perhaps helpful when pitching to Daddy. The youngish director and heiress to American cinema did things her way a few years ago with her ambitious adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' novel The Virgin Suicides, crafting a truly poignant slab of Middle American art with A-list Hollywood talent. This time around, though, her effort feels as pedestrian and confused as its subjects. She hasn't delivered a turkey -- it's a cute little movie, if not as rich as her brother Roman's similarly themed CQ -- but when work this potentially satisfying remains flatly obvious, it's almost worse than being flat-out bad.We begin with a close-up of an ass, and it's tempting to suggest that the remainder of the film is simply a product thereof, but the project's kindly nature doesn't call for that kind of harshness. Rather, the tone is more distinctly bumming. The peach-panty-clad glutes belong to dewy depressed Charlotte (Johansson), who's loitering at the Hyatt in hopes that her busy photojournalist husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), will take five to comfort her. No such luck, but Charlotte does find a surrogate friend in Bob Harris (Murray), an American movie star and cultural castaway who's in town for the noble task of plugging whiskey.Perhaps it cuts just a little too close to home when Charlotte bemoans: &quot;I just don't know what I want to be. I tried being a writer, but I hate what I write. I tried to be a photographer, but I don't take good pictures.&quot; Well, that's OK, but if she's the director's mouthpiece, we've got a problem. This is further complicated by Lost in Translation's being another feature shot on 35mm film with an A-list cast. An amateur with a DV camera would be more welcome under these circumstances, or even the director herself just wandering with her friends across the street from her father's San Francisco offices into Chinatown.

I think it somewhat depends on your ability to connect with the sense of alienation in a strange city and also, how much the two main actors have managed to capture your heart. They did capture mine.I experienced ""Lost in Translation"" as a movie about alienation - not only in a foreign, different city but also the feeling of alienation in your ""home"" or amongst those who are supposedly the closest to you. How suddenly in a different place, which makes you a lot more vulnerable, Charlotte's husband becomes a man she is not sure she knows. I also think that the movie has a very strong declaration about the total alienation of human kind at the face of technology - or so I understood it.This is a story of two people lost in Tokyo. Tokyo is both ugly and captivating in this movie and you feel so very tired...The main characters are suffering severe Jet Lag but I assume they are also mentally tired from all the sights and sounds (there are several scenes filmed inside a sort of video game arcade which holds hundreds of noisy stations) and the need to try and figure everything out, even the most trivial things (such as having a shower).Later in the movie I understood Tokyo to also be a symbol of human alienation everywhere. Off course Tokyo is an easy symbol as the Japanese culture is so totally different. Size, food and humor are so different -- but the movie is not about Tokyo, only the feeling that Tokyo gives you.Two people lost in a foreign city and in their personal lives are able to reach a high level of friendship. It is very interesting to note that the director made this relationship one of friendship that is very expressly in a higher level then sex. As if not to jeopardize or make the friendship ""dirty"" in any sort of way. In fact, when Bob does have a sexual encounter, it is portrayed as something he regrets (according to his behavior, not words).Bill Murray's dry, cynical sense of humor is not lost in this movie and is totally fitting the character he plays. Bob Harris is a tired person, who is not only jet lagged but also a little tired of the life he is leading. Scarlett Johansson plays a smart, cynical young college graduate (""Not everyone studied in Yale"", says her husband) who is amazed from the feeling of loneliness she already holds in such an early stage in her life.The encounter and friendship of these two people lasts only a few days and does not have any future, but manages to reach high levels of closeness, which as always seems to be the only answer to alienation.",5,If you were ever alone in a foreign city...,1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,2654,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'lot', 'many', 'reasons', 'have', 'say', 'can', 'understand', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'different', 'opinion', 'think', 'somewhat', 'ability', 'connect', 'sense', 'alienation', 'strange', 'city', 'also', 'how', 'much', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'have', 'managed', 'capture', 'heart', 'did', 'capture', 'mine.I', 'experienced', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'movie', 'alienation', 'not', 'only', 'foreign', 'different', 'city', 'also', 'feeling', 'alienation', 'home', 'who', 'are', 'supposedly', 'closest', 'How', 'suddenly', 'different', 'place', 'lot', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'Charlotte', 'husband', 'man', 'not', 'sure', 'also', 'think', 'movie', 'very', 'strong', 'declaration', 'total', 'alienation', 'human', 'kind', 'face', 'technology', 'so', 'understood', 'it.This', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'lost', 'Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 'ugly', 'captivating', 'movie', 'feel', 'so', 'very', 'tired', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'suffering', 'severe', 'Jet', 'Lag', 'assume', 'are', 'also', 'mentally', 'tired', 'sights', 'sounds', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'sort', 'video', 'game', 'arcade', 'hundreds', 'noisy', 'stations', 'need', 'try', 'figure', 'everything', 'out', 'even', 'most', 'trivial', 'things', 'such', 'having', 'shower', '.Later', 'movie', 'understood', 'Tokyo', 'also', 'be', 'symbol', 'human', 'alienation', 'everywhere', 'Off', 'course', 'Tokyo', 'easy', 'symbol', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'so', 'totally', 'different', 'Size', 'food', 'humor', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'movie', 'not', 'Tokyo', 'only', 'feeling', 'Tokyo', 'you.Two', 'people', 'lost', 'foreign', 'city', 'personal', 'lives', 'are', 'able', 'reach', 'high', 'level', 'friendship', 'very', 'interesting', 'note', 'director', 'made', 'relationship', 'one', 'friendship', 'very', 'expressly', 'higher', 'level', 'then', 'sex', 'not', 'jeopardize', 'make', 'friendship', 'dirty', 'sort', 'way', 'fact', 'when', 'Bob', 'have', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'portrayed', 'something', 'according', 'behavior', 'not', 'words', '.Bill', 'Murray', 'dry', 'cynical', 'sense', 'humor', 'not', 'lost', 'movie', 'totally', 'fitting', 'character', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'tired', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'jet', 'lagged', 'also', 'little', 'tired', 'life', 'leading', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'smart', 'cynical', 'young', 'college', 'graduate', 'Not', 'everyone', 'studied', 'Yale', 'husband', 'who', 'amazed', 'feeling', 'loneliness', 'already', 'such', 'early', 'stage', 'life.The', 'encounter', 'friendship', 'two', 'people', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'not', 'have', 'future', 'reach', 'high', 'levels', 'closeness', 'always', 'be', 'only', 'answer', 'alienation']",Lost in Translation

Even worse, his stay in the jetlagged Tokyo was lengthened out of business consideration and now he had to face  more lonely sleepless nights.Similarly a university graduate wife of a photographer on business trip in Tokyo was having the same problem. She was having the ""expatriate wife syndrome"" that apart from insomnia, she felt lonely and helpless. She attempted to cure this infinite loneliness by going around the city to look for interesting stuff to do. However, to her surprise, what interested her was another lonely man in the bar of the same hotel.Their encounter sparked off a very interesting relationship and friendship between the pair. They do stuff together, trying new healthy Jap food of which some required them to cook by themselves (a shock for them). The cultural shock was blended into the support that they have for each other in this alien city that they don't want to be in.Lost in Tranlsation deals with the topic of unwillingness, cultural shock and mutual support. Who would foresee a Yale graduate wife of a photographer will develop an interesting friendship with a megastar in his mid-age crisis? The topic was dealt with with delicate care and tenderness mixed with a slim sense of saddness. The director managed to balance all these aspects tactfully. From how she tried to show the audience with how Tokyo life looks like in the 2 hours, we can see that it was well researched as the movie didn't show stereotypical Japanese culture only. The movie gave the Japanese culture a very fair portrayal which is very well done for an American movie.The actors are brilliant. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson gave an excellent performance for the two characters. Bill as an experienced actor in and alien culture doing things he had been doing all his life, but still had no idea how to do it was just fabulous. Scarlett Johansson as a wife longing for care and love in an alien city was also very well done. Her struggle against loneliness by site seeing and hanging out with this mid-age actor was well crafted.The movie portrayed some of the beautiful sceneries from Tokyo and Kyoto and the cinematography is very well done. It is not a typical mainstream movie type of story that you would expect but it does give you a feeling of difference. The gags are very well done and keep the movie interesting. Nonetheless, there are certain parts of the movie that pace slowed down immensely, this could lose a bit of audience attention.

His portrait as Bob, a has-been in Hollywood who came to Japan to shoot a commercial for a whisky company, is amusing and touching at the same time with subtle touch of pathos. He does not say much about himself, but you can feel the emptiness of his life.2) Great acting of Scarlett Johansson, who is also impressive as Charlotte. She embodies the feeling of someone who is `lost,' who knows she should not be here, but cannot leave. The chemistry between Charlotte and Bob is so natural that at first sight it looks as if the actors are not acting at all. (And don't forget Anna Faris who gives an amusing cameo as B-action star).3) Great photography by Lance Acord whose camera exactly shows how the city of Tokyo would look like. The camera captures the vivid images of Shinjuku and Shibuya, two of the major downtowns of the city. Though the film contains a brief sequence in Kyoto - Nanzenji (Nanzen Temple) district and Heian Jingu (Heian Shrine) - that looks like beautifully printed postcard, the cinematography of `Lost in Translation' is most impressive when it introduces us the chaos of the metropolis seen through the eye of Bob and Charlotte. The scenery seen from a hotel window in Shinjuku, or the crowded streets in Shibuya are exactly what you will find in Tokyo.4) Great soundtrack music. Just listen.There are so many flaws in `Lost in Translation': lengthy karaoke sequence should be cut short; a strange Japanese woman who confuses the English pronunciation of `R' and `L' only proves that humor is not Sofia Coppola's strongest point; and Giovanni Ribisi's role is nothing but a cipher. The film looks as if drawn out beyond its limit.See the film for two great acting, photography, and the music. You may not like the rest of the film, but they are genuinely fantastic.",3,Wonderful Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson; So Are the Photography and Music.

619872,ANN4JW1E08AS6,B00005JMJ4,tuberacer,"[0, 0]","Sorry previous reviewer, I neither loved nor hated this film. And reaching a resolution to the question, will they or won't they, is forward plot movement. This film goes expertly well to a place.But this film could easily be called ""My Weekend with Bill Murray"" because the ""Bill Murray"" presence was much too strong--or should I say--is much too strong to be contained within this mostly serious, independently constructed character. The well-established Bill Murray persona overwhelmed the Bob Harris character. This was not Bill Murray's performance of a lifetime as many reviewers have said. He was very good in this film as a mellowed Bill Murray, but ""Groundhog Day"" was Bill Murray's performance of a lifetime so far, followed by his part in ""Caddyshack.""  Those are the parts that closely fit Bill Murray. This Bob Harris character who's a big action movie star who's hired to glamorize Suntory and who's so attractive to all the women (well, at least the white women) who pass him by?--come on, that's not Bill Murray and it makes no sense putting him into such a character. Mel Gibson or Wesley Snipes, maybe, but Bill Murray and all his gaunt looks and sardonic humor? Bill Murray in this part doesn't ring true at all for me, especially since he's still doing his usual shtick, although a very subdued, chastened version of it mixed in with dramatic acting. There's still the familiar SNL comic mixed into this Bob Harris.And then the fact that this supposedly major American movie star, whose face is plastered on billboards, can walk all around Tokyo in all his fame and tallness and not get recognized and swamped by any of the Japanese on the streets or in the restaurants? Ridiculous. Where are all the teenage Japanese schoolgirls huddled on the side and pointing and giggling? Where are the paparazzi? Either you break down and call this film what it essentially is-- an underwritten Bill Murray film--or you concede that it was miscast and in many ways makes no sense. And then on top of everything else, they make his relationship with his wife on the phone so one-dimensional with she so cold and he so obviously jilted. What an easy setup.So it sounds like I disliked the film? Nope, I really liked it and recommend it.  It was a nice diversion, very different in its way, and had an interestingly delicate relationship as its subject. This is another movie which is obviously a finely tuned collaboration of many cinematic artists and Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray list a few of them in their interview in the Bonus Features on the DVD. It was a fun, successful depiction of Tokyo and some of its zany culture. The relationship between Bob Harris and Charlotte was different than the standard romance, and there's always a question of whether it's a true romance or not. I can't help thinking it was, in essence, more a father-daughter relationship and the real message of this film is, it's ok to let go of Daddy. Bill Murray in this film, as the sardonic Bill Murray, has the quality that gay men stereotypically have in many stories about confused women--he's safe to talk to and hang out with, and in this film, as a much older man, he is at times, almost more like a doting father, or teacher, or older brother, but definitely, at all times safe. The dialogue was too sparse. You'd think someone who just graduated with a degree in philosophy would have more intelligent, or at least, more intellectual things to say. She's pretty lightweight, all in all. Just a grown kid, newly woman, with a funk.So that's it, a somewhat fun film which is, like someone previously characterized it, quite underwhelming, but well worth watching. No one can doubt that Sofia Coppola will get better and better as she gets more practice as a filmmaker and will probably adds some real greats to the cinematic heritage. Maybe she first needs to get past her Daddy. Sorry, that wasn't meant to sound mean. It just came obviously to mind in my armchair psychologist brain while watching this film.One thing strange, the R rating is only because of one short scene in a strip joint which could easily have been edited out or redone to PG standards. I guess they really wanted that R rating. Explain that.And yes, as someone earlier pointed out, the lack of now-standard viewer controls with this DVD is really annoying. Don't keep pushing the ""DVD menu"" button, it won't work. But it's a good movie despite all the above.

619873,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00005JMJ4,Tucker Andersen,"[8, 16]","I recognize that this review definitely represents a minority viewpoint regarding the merits of this film. I hope that it nevertheless will provide valuable insights to moviegoers whose tastes resemble my own, and that in addition it provides some counterbalance to those reviewers whose admiration for the obvious merits of this film causes them to gloss over what I regard as legimate criticisms.I will begin by conceding the following positives. First, the concept animating the film has excellent potential and the title is indeed an accurate reflection of the concept behind the film. Second, the acting of the two leads is indeed excellent and their chemistry develops exactly as intended.. Third, the cinematography is also quite good. Fourth, there are several very clever moments and some truly enjoyable humorous incidents. Fifth and last, the movie captures some wonderful scenes of Tokyo and the aura it creates exactly mirrors all my totally uninformed preconceptions of what life in Tokyo is like for the upper classes. Thus, while I'm not at all sure that I would concede that Bill Murray's performance is of Academy Award potential as his admirers claim, it is certainly first rate and was one of the elements that provided some enjoyment in a film that I found tedious overall.The idea (it does not really rise to the level of a plot) is simplicity itself. Bill Harris (Murray) arrives in Tokyo to be photographed for an advertising campaign, an aging celebrity who has agreed to endorse a line of alcoholic drinks in return for two million dollars. He doesn't understand the language so can't converse or watch televsion, is sleepless because of jet lag, has a translator who is of little help, and ends up whiling his late nights away in the hotel bar. Coincidentally Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is plagued by the same problems and winds up in the same bar while her husband, a photographer who she has accompanied on his shoot in Japan, ignores her to pursue his work and old friendships. Thus, in their isolation they gradually form a bond of friendship and participate in both the Tokyo nightlife and discussions of their situation. There is an undercurrent of attraction, as she is younger and definitely very easy to look at, while he provides some of the intellectual stimulation and attention completely lacking from her husband. While Bob feels further isolated by the very brief contacts that he has with his wife due to her busy routine (and exacerbated by the time differential between Tokyo and the United States), he still seems to be comfortable with his life and just waiting to finish his assignment, collect his enormous fee, and return home to resume his routine . Meanwhile Charlotte seems too young and too recently married to have any serious thoughts regarding her apparent lack of compatibility with her husband. Thus, their friendship remains exactly that, both perhaps wanting more but neither ready to translate their feelings into a serious discussion about themselves. It appears that not just foreign languages often lose something in translation.Thus in the end, to mix metaphors, they are like two trains bound for nowhere simply passing in the night. This movie is an artistically excellent examination of some elements of the human condition but does not capitalize on its potential, perhaps it was LOST IN TRANSLATION. My reaction was the same as when viewing paintings by great artists that neither inspire or interest me. I may admire the technique and the technical brillance, but their totality leaves me unmoved. It seems to me that the only reason to watch this movie is for the existential experience of the viewing itself, and I found it too long and tedious and the subject matter of too little interest for the experience itself to be very worthwhile. There is no greater meaning or real story here. This is a movie that I will probably never want to watch again, although film clips of a few of the more memorable scenes would be quite enjoyable. Thus, I decided to round down my rating as a reflection of my personal reaction to the film, not as a reflection of its overall quality. If you like brilliantly directed and technically inteesting films, you will probably enjoy this. And if you are a Bill Murray fan it is defintely worth your time. But if you want a great plot and interesting story, there are plenty of better movies to attend.Tucker Andersen",2,(2 1/2) Excellent Peformances - Why Not A Five Star Rating?,1065398400,"10 6, 2003",2003,4425,"['recognize', 'review', 'definitely', 'minority', 'viewpoint', 'regarding', 'merits', 'film', 'hope', 'nevertheless', 'will', 'provide', 'valuable', 'insights', 'moviegoers', 'tastes', 'resemble', 'own', 'addition', 'counterbalance', 'reviewers', 'admiration', 'obvious', 'merits', 'film', 'gloss', 'what', 'regard', 'legimate', 'criticisms.I', 'will', 'begin', 'conceding', 'following', 'positives', 'First', 'concept', 'animating', 'film', 'excellent', 'potential', 'title', 'indeed', 'accurate', 'reflection', 'concept', 'film', 'Second', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'indeed', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'exactly', 'intended..', 'Third', 'cinematography', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Fourth', 'are', 'several', 'very', 'clever', 'moments', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'humorous', 'incidents', 'Fifth', 'last', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'Tokyo', 'aura', 'exactly', 'mirrors', 'totally', 'uninformed', 'preconceptions', 'what', 'life', 'Tokyo', 'upper', 'classes', 'Thus', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'concede', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'performance', 'Academy', 'Award', 'potential', 'admirers', 'claim', 'certainly', 'first', 'rate', 'was', 'one', 'elements', 'provided', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'found', 'tedious', 'overall.The', 'idea', 'not', 'really', 'rise', 'level', 'plot', 'simplicity', 'Bill', 'Harris', 'Murray', 'Tokyo', 'be', 'photographed', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'aging', 'celebrity', 'who', 'agreed', 'endorse', 'line', 'alcoholic', 'drinks', 'return', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', ""n't"", 'understand', 'language', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'converse', 'watch', 'televsion', 'sleepless', 'jet', 'lag', 'translator', 'who', 'little', 'help', 'up', 'whiling', 'late', 'nights', 'away', 'hotel', 'bar', 'Coincidentally', 'Charlotte', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'plagued', 'same', 'problems', 'up', 'same', 'bar', 'husband', 'photographer', 'who', 'accompanied', 'shoot', 'Japan', 'pursue', 'work', 'old', 'friendships', 'Thus', 'isolation', 'gradually', 'form', 'bond', 'friendship', 'participate', 'Tokyo', 'nightlife', 'discussions', 'situation', 'undercurrent', 'attraction', 'younger', 'definitely', 'very', 'easy', 'look', 'intellectual', 'stimulation', 'attention', 'completely', 'lacking', 'husband', 'Bob', 'feels', 'further', 'isolated', 'very', 'brief', 'contacts', 'wife', 'due', 'busy', 'routine', 'exacerbated', 'time', 'differential', 'Tokyo', 'United', 'States', 'still', 'be', 'comfortable', 'life', 'just', 'waiting', 'finish', 'assignment', 'collect', 'enormous', 'fee', 'return', 'home', 'resume', 'routine', 'Meanwhile', 'Charlotte', 'too', 'young', 'too', 'recently', 'married', 'have', 'serious', 'thoughts', 'regarding', 'apparent', 'lack', 'compatibility', 'husband', 'Thus', 'friendship', 'exactly', 'perhaps', 'wanting', 'more', 'ready', 'translate', 'feelings', 'serious', 'discussion', 'not', 'just', 'foreign', 'languages', 'often', 'lose', 'something', 'translation.Thus', 'end', 'mix', 'metaphors', 'are', 'two', 'trains', 'nowhere', 'simply', 'passing', 'night', 'movie', 'artistically', 'excellent', 'examination', 'elements', 'human', 'condition', 'not', 'capitalize', 'potential', 'perhaps', 'was', 'LOST', 'IN', 'TRANSLATION', 'reaction', 'was', 'same', 'when', 'viewing', 'paintings', 'great', 'artists', 'inspire', 'interest', 'may', 'admire', 'technique', 'technical', 'brillance', 'totality', 'unmoved', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'existential', 'experience', 'viewing', 'found', 'too', 'long', 'tedious', 'subject', 'matter', 'too', 'little', 'interest', 'experience', 'be', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'greater', 'meaning', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'film', 'clips', 'few', 'more', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Thus', 'decided', 'round', 'down', 'rating', 'reflection', 'personal', 'reaction', 'film', 'not', 'reflection', 'overall', 'quality', 'like', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'technically', 'inteesting', 'films', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'are', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'fan', 'defintely', 'worth', 'time', 'want', 'great', 'plot', 'interesting', 'story', 'are', 'plenty', 'better', 'movies', 'attend.Tucker', 'Andersen']",Lost in Translation

Each one of us knows what it is like to be surrouned by many people, yet feel totally and utterlessly alone. At the same time, all of us also know what it is like to find true fellowship with someone; not the masked, skin-deep appearances that many mistake for friendship, but the true soul-connecting fellowship that alleviates the pain that lonliness leaves. That's part of what LOST IN TRANSLATION is about. It also has some other things to say: to truly enjoy life you have to know yourself; people can be friends without being lovers; and sometimes the smallest things in life are the most meaningful.This is Bill Murray's finest performance to date and he'll probably get an Oscar nomination.The movie is definitely not for everyone. It moves really slow, even in the ""fast"" scenes. Also, for a character driven film, there isn't much dialogue either. Instead, the characters are brought to life by what we see them do, which to be honest isn't much. However, what they actually do, is what many people actually do every day anyway. Here is a reality film that seems truly real. My only real complaint about the film was the unnecessary scene in the strip club; it doesn't add anything to the plot nor does it give the audience any deeper insight into the main characters. If it wasn't for that one scene, the movie probably would be PG-13 instead of R.Overall, this is a movie not for the typical movie-goer. It's not the usual independent type of film either.

They are lost ""in the original"", in their original lives back in the United States as well.

On a second viewing, after leaving my expectations in the multiplex, I came to appreciate and even fall in love with this small, beautiful and touching ART FILM. It reminds one of the 70's New Hollywood filmmaking, when auteurs where testing the bounds of film and audiences' patience. Films like MIDNIGHT COWBOY, THE LAST DETAIL, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, MEAN STREETS, and EASY RIDER. And more recently with films like ABOUT SCHMIDT. Small films, with small plot structures, that left big impressions. And I can assure you, this is the very reason this film is garnering the rcognition it deserves. Those of you who love those kinds of films know what I'm talking about. You'll love this too. Although, you've probably already seen it. Those of you expecting a film of the HOLLYWOOD GROSS mentality must look elsewhere. THIS IS AN ART FILM. Hilarious, too. I hope this inspires many more small auteur films such as this. God knows we need 'em. Nice work, Sophia. Oh, now that Spike's out of the picture, can we go out?

I decided to give this movie two stars, one for the good cinematography and the other for trying to be different.This movie had a lot of potential, it's about an older man who is having a mid-life crisis and a young woman who is trying to find herself but is feeling lost (both are from America). A plot that speaks to a lot of people I'm sure. The way this story is told is where it goes wrong. It felt like the director wanted to skimp on characterization so she took the easy way out and used a foreign country to showcase these two characters' feelings of loneliness and alienation instead of exploring why and how they became like this in America. The reason why I think this is because setting the movie in Japan does nothing to furthur explore these characters especially since they were already alone and lost BEFORE coming to Japan. I was disappointed to see the way the director portrayed Japanese people as weird and speaks bad English. I thought the way she highlighted these things were untrue, shallow, and unneccessary. She could have achieved the same effect (them being ""lost"") simply by focusing on the fact that they didn't know the area or any of the people there.These two characters were also two very weak and boring people. Here they are disillusioned with thier lives, they have a perfect chance to find themselves again because they are in a beautiful, exciting, innovative country. All they have to do is walk outside and yet they sit around their hotel waiting for something to happen to them. How illogical is that?! Instead of being two mature people who can experience and enjoy thier great oppurtunities, they act like two immature, shallow kids.I absolutely respect endings that are meaningful. I certainly don't expect to have things spelled out for me but I also don't want a pretentious ending.If you are looking for a movie in this genre then try ""American Beauty"".

619880,A9OVXY24IY777,B00005JMJ4,"""velurion""","[3, 5]","Man, another movie that leaves audiences completely divided. Well, I had wanted to see this from the get-go, and though a friend (whose opinion I normally trust) said it didn't live up to his expectations, I personally disagree.It is possible that if you've never immersed yourself in another culture, then you might dislike this film for a variety of reasons; you might have the knee-jerk reaction ""well, I never wanna go to Japan!"", but Lost In Translation is not a travel guide for the casual tourist. The characters in the movies are not tourists either. Bill Murray's Bob Harris is in Tokyo to do a TV commercial, and Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte is along for the ride with her working photographer hubby (played by Giovanni Ribisi). These two people are ""lost"" and confused in a world that they didn't choose to discover, so don't expect the camera to focus on the aspects of Japanese culture and history that might actually fascinate you.So, we've got Bill Murray - another excellent understated performance (restrained in the same way as his role was in RUSHMORE) - and Scarlett Johansson (who I liked in the otherwise boring HORSE WHISPERER), and they meet in a hotel bar and develop an affinity for one another. Though it's a matter of interpretation, I don't think a romantic relationship really does or is supposed to develop between the two, still, if you are so inclined you can read into their interactions in whatever way you want. I've been the foreigner on many an occasion in another country/culture, and I can confirm that in moments of boredom and perhaps confusion it was a relief meeting a person who was in the same boat as me. Does that mean I have to fall in love and sleep with them just because they can relate to my situation? Come on, that's silly.I liked the acting, the look, the subtlety of details, and I liked the humour - which doesn't manifest itself in the usual Hollywood Ha-Ha kind of way. Also, the humour is not constant; the latter part of the movie is not nearly as amusing as the classic Murray reactionary humour of the first half, so please, don't expect the ""Best Comedy of the Year"". It's not that kind of movie.I read a lot of reviews when the movie was released of people who struggled with the ending calling it 'sad', 'cheap', 'inappropriate', 'unfulfilling' etc. Hmm. I don't know what they were expecting. Let's just say there is no real 'ending' in the traditional movie sense. The final exchange between Bob and Charlotte is left open-ended. I, for one, thought it was the perfect ending. Anything more dramatic would have felt out of place. And besides, I was able to fill in the blanks myself. It's nice when movies let the audience do that.Still, despite all my good feelings towards Lost in Translation, there are flaws. Some people liked the music, but there were several moments in my mind, where that damn music gets spread on too thick. Soft and tinkly one minute, loud and annoying the next. What are we trying to communicate here? Any thing at all? The other thing is that Sofia Coppola (the director) lets the camera linger a wee bit too long on some shots. How many times do we have to see Charlotte sitting on her 100th floor high windowsill overlooking the city? We get the picture.Anyway, it's got some flaws, and it's easy to point them out when - as a viewer - you're so used to being given a certain amount of information either visually or verbally. Well, Lost in Translation doesn't fill in all the gaps for you.

619881,A2GOT71TLMZ5I5,B00005JMJ4,Victor Capo,"[10, 14]","First off, let me say that this movie is NOT a comedy.  Admittedly, it has its funny (and sometimes hysterical) moments, but it's not a kind of light-hearted film you watch to pick yourself up.Secondly, this movie certainly has a lot of hype (that's how I ended up seeing it), but it doesn't live up to it (and no movie ever does, as another reviewer pointed out).  If you've got some gargantuan expectations about this film, you should rent before you buy.That's not to say the movie is bad, though.  In fact, this is probably one of the greatest films I've seen in my life.  I admit, when I first saw it, it was certainly not what I was expecting.  It's very slowly-paced, it's not your typical, straight-forward narrative, and the location (Tokyo) of the film threw me off as well.  But what counts here are the characters and their development throughout the film.  I usually don't like Bill Murray (a little too slap-stick for me), but this truly is one of his best performances (that I've seen), for he's so subtle and toned down from the whacky guy so many people are used to, but that adds an enormous amount of depth to the film.  He manages to convey so much with simple expressions and mannerisms alone.And Scarlett Johansson is also wonderful playing a soul-searching, borderline-apathetic/jaded young wife discovering the real world and opening her eyes to, and truly looking at her own life for the very first time.  Her chemistry with Bill Murray is unmatched.  Less than halfway through the movie, I fell in love with both chracters and really cared about them by the end.The soundtrack is also incredible.  If you're in the mood for a quiet movie that'll make you think a little (about yourself and your own life, not in terms of plot), definitely check this out.

619882,AMB2Z4FMDBWQY,B00005JMJ4,"VIDFAN ""specfellow""","[7, 23]","I join at least 550 other Amazon reviewers who found this movie boring and somewhat offensive. In outline, the concept is not bad - two strangers who meet in a strange country, feeling alientated - but the execution leaves much to be desired.It's clear that Sofia Coppola has gone to the European School of Prententious Filmmaking, where ""art"" is supposedly conveyed by long, empty silences and people staring impassively at the camera. The vapid Ms. Johansson, with her painfully unformed and Nordic impassivity, fits the bill to a T. The problem is when these ""meaningful silences"" aren't really meaningful. Rather than ""art"", Coppola's scenes of silence tell me she ran out of things to say.It's also clear how Coppola regards people who aren't European. Making fun of Japanese people, lampooning them in this film, really put me off. The comic bits of the film derives solely from Bill Murray doing a whisky commercial over and over. The point of this comedy is: ""Aren't Japanese people funny? Aren't they weird and bizarre?""No, they're human beings. Tolerance and trying to understand another culture (and failing) isn't the point of the film - rather, it's about how justified two spoiled and vapid people feel about being alienated. The film would have been far more interesting if Murray and Johnasson had tried to communicate with the foreign culture around them, and failed. But in Coppola's film, they don't even bother trying. The characters are only there for the money (in Murray's case) or because they've been dumped there (Johnasson). Japan is a fascinating country, but you'd never know it watching this film.Instead of ""Lost in Translation,"" Coppola should have called it ""Lost in Themselves.""",1,"Naive, Pretentious Film That Makes Fun of Japanese People",1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,1712,"['join', 'least', '550', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'who', 'found', 'movie', 'boring', 'somewhat', 'offensive', 'outline', 'concept', 'not', 'bad', 'two', 'strangers', 'who', 'meet', 'strange', 'country', 'feeling', 'alientated', 'execution', 'much', 'be', 'desired.It', 'clear', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'gone', 'European', 'School', 'Prententious', 'Filmmaking', 'where', 'art', 'supposedly', 'conveyed', 'long', 'empty', 'silences', 'people', 'staring', 'impassively', 'camera', 'vapid', 'Ms.', 'Johansson', 'painfully', 'unformed', 'Nordic', 'impassivity', 'bill', 'T.', 'problem', 'when', 'meaningful', 'silences', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'meaningful', 'Rather', 'art', 'Coppola', 'scenes', 'silence', 'tell', 'ran', 'out', 'things', 'say.It', 'also', 'clear', 'how', 'Coppola', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'European', 'Making', 'fun', 'Japanese', 'people', 'lampooning', 'film', 'really', 'put', 'off', 'comic', 'bits', 'film', 'solely', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'doing', 'whisky', 'commercial', 'over', 'point', 'comedy', 'Are', ""n't"", 'Japanese', 'people', 'funny', 'Are', ""n't"", 'weird', 'bizarre', 'No', ""'re"", 'human', 'beings', 'Tolerance', 'trying', 'understand', 'culture', 'failing', ""n't"", 'point', 'film', 'rather', 'how', 'justified', 'two', 'spoiled', 'vapid', 'people', 'feel', 'being', 'alienated', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'Murray', 'Johnasson', 'had', 'tried', 'communicate', 'foreign', 'culture', 'failed', 'Coppola', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'trying', 'characters', 'are', 'only', 'there', 'money', 'Murray', 'case', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dumped', 'Johnasson', 'Japan', 'fascinating', 'country', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'watching', 'film.Instead', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Coppola', 'should', 'have', 'called', 'Lost', 'Themselves']",Lost in Translation
619883,A2O5TLE802NTA8,B00005JMJ4,"Vinny Carpenter ""j2eegeek.com/blog""","[0, 1]","Lost in Translation is the best movie of 2003 - Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, this movie stars Bill Murray who plays the character of Bob Harris,  an out-of-work actor and a has-been that's in Japan doing Whiskey commercial.  Bob is lost in his life and going through a mid life crisis.  In Tokyo, he meets up Charlotte played by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson.  Charlotte is in Tokyo with her photographer husband and is equally lost trying to find her place in this world.As the movie progresses, Bob and Charlotte form a friendship that starts to deepen into a budding romance as these two lost souls find each other.  The movie does an incredible job of capturing these two people as they find each other in Tokyo.  The visuals are just incredible and the movie does an amazing job of capturing the magnificent vistas in Japan.The extras on the DVD make it worth owing this DVD.  I think the 20 seconds of Bill Murray dancing in his robe in the 'Making Of' section is worth the price of the DVD.  The one thing that I was disappointed with was the lack of director's commentary on the DVD.This is a really great movie that's also very funny which is to be expected with Bill Murray.  There are just to many great scenes and funny lines to list here, but the movie will have you laughing.

With great acting, great cinematography and a smoothe, touching story, ""Lost In Translation"" proves itself to be one of the best films of the year so far.The story is as follows: Two married people who find that marriage can be tough come together, confused and lost in Japan, not enjoying themselves very much.  But as they meet, they gain a wonderful friendship.  And went it starts to have the potential to carry too far, they both must decide if they should stay faithful or have an affair.Bill Murrey has an Oscar potential role in this film.  He is continuously sad, but maintains a subtle happiness that lights up the screen at times.  It takes a great actor to balance that out.  Scarlett Johannsen, suprisingly, takes on a similar role with a great force that really amazes you.  They both make you sad, happy and inbetween at the same time.The cinematography, at times, was outstanding.  There were certain affects that the camera achieved that really made you feel different emotions and see different things about the landscape and the person.  It is quite interesting.Now, here are the disclaimers.  It does movie relatively slow, but jokes keep it interesting.  It is a romantic comedy.  But don't be too discouraged if you don't like them.  It is a different type.  It also doesn't really have much of a climax.  It has a subtle exciting end, but no action or anything of that sort.  But those are the only issues.

The film also stars Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte, the American wife of an American photographer who has tagged along with her husband on his business trip to Tokyo.  Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this movie and it was beautifully filmed by Lance Acord.The film is about two people in a alien culture connecting in a way that they would never have connected back in the States.  If you've ever been to Asia on a business trip, this film captures perfectly the overwhelming off-kilter sense that an American feels in large Asian cities.  Superficially, they are made out of the same elements, concrete, bricks, glass, pavement, and the structures are similar, tall buildings, streets, sidewalks, cars.  But everything is just slightly different and some things are enormously different.  I had to laugh when Bill Murray came out of the hotel and onto the street and saw a van driving down the street with two Japanese women dressed like Jackie Onasis waving to onlookers as another woman exhorted the crowds in Japanese over a loudspeaker.  I've seen similar things myself in Taiwan and probably had the same confused expression on my face as Bill Murray did.  When you are immersed in a different culture, you can often run across things that are just baffling.  Sofia Coppola captures that feeling perfectly.And it's in this strange world that Bob meets Charlotte.  Both married, but both bored and somewhat overwhelmed by their surroundings.  In America, they'd hardly glance at each other, because Bob is 20 years older than Charlotte, and they really have very little in common.  But in Tokyo, compared to everyone else they run across, they have a lot in common.  So they connect, they talk, they start hanging out together, they explore a little of Tokyo together.  And at the end of the movie, Bob flies back to the States, and Charlotte awaits her husband's return from a two day side trip to Kyoto.  Both of them gained a lot from the experience and both of them have changed, for the better.  Kind of a bittersweet ending because you get the feeling they'll never see each other again.This is really a wonderful, engrossing film though.  It is marvelously well written and directed.  Bill Murray is perfect as the slightly bewildered American in the strange world of Tokyo advertising.  Scarlett Johansson is extraordinary as the twenty-something young wife with a philosophy degree wondering about her future.

Not a good recommendation ...and yet I certainly cannot say that I didn't like it, or even greatly admire the skilled photography and, yes, direction. I'm just not sure I get the point.Bill Murray plays a disaffected American actor who comes to Japan to make a $2 million commercial touting a Japanese brand of whiskey. Oh no, Bill has sold out. His angst tells the tale as he suffers through the shoot and then through a number of publicity stills destined to make the sides of buses throughout Tokyo. In the middle of this he meets an equally disaffected young wife (Scarlett Johansson)who is in Japan accompanying her photgrapher husband. We know she is unhappy because she spends at least half her time sitting on the window ledge in her hotel room, looking out at the scenery.Bill and Scarlett meet. They share their angst and their snide humor, mostly aimed at the Japanese. They also bond and have some fun. Story drags on.I do see why Sofia Coppola has been rewarded for her superb direction; there are no superfluous scenes, everything is flawless, Tokyo is shown at its best and is skillfully used as anoter major character in the film.Watching the extra material, however, is painful, at least for me. We have a long long long look at pre-production and the early days of shooting, where we meet much of the senior crew on the film. We have a mediocre video. We DO, however, get to see more of a hilarious, funky Japanese TV show, upon which Bill Murray guests in the film. That's almost worth the price of the DVD. I did not watch the deleted scenes or the interview with Bill and Sofia--I had seen enough of each of them on the pre-production segment, and I didn't want the memory of deleted scenes to spoil my pleasure in the editing of the film itself.Enough said.

It is one of the most praised films of the year and probably  finished second to Lord of the Rings for Oscar's Best Picture.Therefore, it creates an interesting enigma.  How can one film produce such admiration in some and disdain in most?  The answer lies in its nontraditional storytelling.  Writer/director Sophia Coppola decided to abandon powerful drama, instead opting for a film that focuses primarily on character development.  As far as story goes, the film really lacks a large plot-arc with any kind of driving conflict.  Each scene is enjoyable as little vignettes, but most viewers will search for (and not find) something larger to keep their attention.  The end result is a film with an almost ""Reality-Tv"" feel.  It is if a camera crew followed two people around Japan, just to document their lives.What saves this artsy piece is a career performance by Bill Murray.

619893,A20WKQ948WZOQJ,B00005JMJ4,Wes Saylors Jr.,"[4, 5]","This movie is charming and soulful and wonderful on many, many levels ... but one of the nicest surprises is seeing Bill Murray show the sort of warmth he possessed in MEATBALLS.  As a stranded actor adrift on the planet Tokyo, Bill shows his road miles and it is endearing.  Scarlett Johansson is near sublime as another stranded American and the two create the kind of low key magic that is near impossible to find in a mainstream movie these days. Usually we get the sort of forced sparks that a Meg Ryan movie pummels us with.

Everybody probably just says they love it because everybody else says they should. I know. I have my suspicions about movies like that. I've watched people tremble and say, ""LIT changed my life it is soooooo goood.""Here is a level-headed opinion on why this is a good movie: This movie is about loneliness and isolation in a close-packed city of millions. You feel the character's loneliness. You feel their brief sparks of connection. You feel them clutch at opportunities for connection.And it takes skill to pull this off - this movie could have quickly gone into non-narrative snoozeville. But although she follows the climax resolution format, the framework doesn't come poking through the story like it does in so many Hollywood films. It flows like a well documented life and that's high praise.Also, to see Bill Murray be such a great, mature character is a thing of beauty. Like when John Travolta came back courtesy of Pulp Fiction.Movies today aren't so good. So many are made to show off a special effects technique or to make a big car chase or be a vehicle for a star.

He's been married forever and is growing increasingly emotionally aloof; however, something tells him that he's not happy.  Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, a young woman who's been married to her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) for two years.  She recently completed college and feels lost, with no idea where she fits into the world.  Somehow these two confused souls find each other amidst the jumble of Tokyo and form an unlikely bond.People may go into this movie with many misconceptions, particularly thinking it's a typical Bill Murray comedy. You'll likely chuckle a few times but there are few riotously funny scenes, although I did laugh pretty hard when Murray encounters the ""Premium Fantasy woman.""  Likewise, the pace is measured and some of the scenes may seem unnecessary, as they seem to add more to the tone of the movie than the plot; stick with this movie despite it's languorous pace.  Ultimately, Lost in Translation is a genre-defying movie - part drama, part broad comedy, part black comedy, part romance, and so forth.  However, what it does remind me of the most is a classic 1940s movie - Brief Encounter; both are understated romances whereby two people meet tenuously and find hope.I really disliked Sofia Coppola's directorial debut, the amateurish Virgin Suicides.  However, she is in full control of her craft in this movie.  She's found a unique voice that astutely addresses the disaffection and isolation so many of us feel in the modern world.  Justifiably, she's become the first American woman to be nominated for Best Director by the Academy Awards and only the third woman in history to receive this honor.  In addition to the superior direction, Bill Murray is outstanding, balancing his natural talents in comedy and pathos luminously.  Overall, I most highly recommend this movie.Extras - The DVD contains a number of extras, including a fascinating backstage documentary filmed by Sofia Coppola's then husband, Spike Jonze, as well as a plethora of deleted scenes.",5,A 21st Century Brief Encounter,1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,2154,"['Lost', 'Translation', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'ideal', 'role', 'playing', 'washed', 'up', 'actor', 'making', 'commercial', 'Tokyo', 'quick', 'buck', 'been', 'married', 'forever', 'growing', 'increasingly', 'emotionally', 'aloof', 'however', 'something', 'tells', 'not', 'happy', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Charlotte', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'photographer', 'husband', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'two', 'years', 'recently', 'completed', 'college', 'feels', 'lost', 'idea', 'where', 'world', 'Somehow', 'two', 'confused', 'souls', 'find', 'other', 'jumble', 'Tokyo', 'form', 'unlikely', 'bond.People', 'may', 'go', 'movie', 'many', 'misconceptions', 'particularly', 'thinking', 'typical', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'chuckle', 'few', 'times', 'are', 'few', 'riotously', 'funny', 'scenes', 'did', 'laugh', 'pretty', 'hard', 'when', 'Murray', 'Premium', 'Fantasy', 'woman', 'Likewise', 'pace', 'measured', 'scenes', 'may', 'seem', 'unnecessary', 'seem', 'add', 'more', 'tone', 'movie', 'plot', 'stick', 'movie', 'languorous', 'pace', 'Ultimately', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'genre-defying', 'movie', 'part', 'drama', 'part', 'broad', 'comedy', 'part', 'black', 'comedy', 'part', 'romance', 'so', 'forth', 'However', 'what', 'remind', 'most', 'classic', '1940s', 'movie', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'are', 'understated', 'romances', 'whereby', 'two', 'people', 'meet', 'tenuously', 'find', 'hope.I', 'really', 'disliked', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'directorial', 'debut', 'amateurish', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'However', 'full', 'control', 'craft', 'movie', 'found', 'unique', 'voice', 'astutely', 'disaffection', 'isolation', 'so', 'many', 'feel', 'modern', 'world', 'Justifiably', 'become', 'first', 'American', 'woman', 'be', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'only', 'third', 'woman', 'history', 'receive', 'honor', 'addition', 'superior', 'direction', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'outstanding', 'balancing', 'natural', 'talents', 'comedy', 'pathos', 'luminously', 'Overall', 'most', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie.Extras', 'DVD', 'number', 'extras', 'including', 'fascinating', 'backstage', 'documentary', 'filmed', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'then', 'husband', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'as', 'well', 'plethora', 'deleted', 'scenes']",Lost in Translation

When I first watched the film it appeared that there was not much of a story, yet when I thought back later I realized that I was wrong.  For example Tokyo is the seen but not heard ""third"" character. What I mean by that is Tokyo is scene as being huge and you have Bill Murray who is seen as being along. Tokyo gives the appearance of isolation. Which fuels the idea of communication. Bill Murray's character is lost in not only his own world but also where he currently is. We are giving the idea that his marriage is falling apart and is in a place that is nothing like home. These two things combined created loneliness.  The same for Scarlett Johansson being in a place where she does not fit in and a husband who is talking a past her these two people were made to find one another and connect if only for a short time.This is the best roll that Bill Murray has done since ""Rushmore."" The same can be said for Scarlett Johansson since ""Ghost World"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"".  As far as comparing ""Lost in Translation"" to the ""Virgin Suicides"" it is hard to do because they are two different films and it is hard to say how they are alike.  The one thing I can say is that the two films has a simplified story. The images, music and silence all set the tone of the film and helped move it forward. This is compared to have the story, dialogue, and music move the movie, and tell us how are to feel. I tend to like the first way better because for one it breaks away from the ""standard boring American"" flicks.This film is truly an art house film. Because the expectations. Most American's need instant gratification of story, plot and character and have everything spelled out, and spoon-feed to get anything out of the movie. For those of us who do not these things it is a great movie. When you take ""Lost in Translation"" for what it is; a story about two people who are lost in their own worlds and seeking a connection.  It's reasons like this that makes this movie work.For those who say you have to watch it a few times I agree with it. Though I got the film on the first try. For those who are going to hit me in the face a few times go ahead, you might beat some of the ugly out of me and improve my looks so thanks for offering.

619901,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00005JMJ4,Wuchak,"[8, 12]","Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" was a big hit in 2003-2004. It's about an aging actor, Bob Harris (Bill Murray), who's in Tokyo doing commercials for a week. His homelife is mundane and he's experiencing a bit of the mid-life crisis. He runs into an attractive 20-something woman, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who's in Tokyo with her photog husband, but he's gone most of the time and takes her for granted.This is a mature, one-of-a-kind film and you have to be in the right mode and maturity level to appreciate it. I said ""maturity level"" and not ""age"" because some people are pretty mature at 16 while others are completely immature at 50. I didn't view the film until last night and it worked for me. The story, music and visuals pulled me into these character's temporary world for the 104-minute runtime.The film succeeds as an amusing social commentary and a deep love story, as well as a visual/musical delight. I'll only focus on the deep love element. It's been noted that the story orginated from writer/director Sofia's experiences with an aging actor, possibly Harrison Ford. Sofia is obviously Charlotte, while Charlotte's husband is Sofia's ex and Anna Faris plays the role of the other woman, which would be Cameron Diaz in real life. So there's a lot of reality in this picture.But it's not just a cathartic piece, Sofia has some powerful insights to offer on the nature of true romantic love. For one, love transcends age difference (Bob is about 30 years older than Charlotte). For another, it's possible to be married and experience romantic love for another. Not that this ever justifies adultery, it's just a fact. As the story progresses you'll see how comfortable Bob and Charlotte are with each other, how they look into each other's eyes -- the windows of the soul -- in a profoundly naked sense. This can happen in the flash of a moment where the two people just KNOW or it can take place over a period of time, as is the case with Bob and Charlotte (a handful of days). They see the same things and speak the same language, and I don't mean English. But this presents a conundrum for Bob. Bob could take advantage of Charlotte because she's so lonely in a sea of people, which is one of the movie's themes; she's also inexperienced and vunerable. Will he or won't he take advantage?!!SPOILER ALERT!! Don't read further if you haven't seen the film.If Bob loves Charlotte so much (not to mention his wife) why does he have a one-night stand with the lounge singer? Bob slept with the singer to release sexual tension that had been building up between him and Charlotte. This was a moral failure, but keep in mind he was drunk (another failure, but have pity, he was going through a mid-life crisis). While all this is obvious, it goes deeper...Bob could have taken advantage of Charlotte if he wanted to but didn't because he genuinely loved her, which is revealed at the end. Bob could sleep with the singer because he didn't love her (not that it justifies his actions). Simply put, true love transcends sexual expression and sexual union does not equal love.The ending is powerful and tear-inducing. No CGI, explosion or action stunt can compare. It's just an older man and a too-young woman embracing in the midst of 20 million. Tears flow, kisses are given and unheard words are whispered. They could never be a couple, even if they weren't married, and they know they'll likely never see each other again, but their love has been expressed and will be treasured for eternity.",5,True love transcends sexual expression,1314144000,"08 24, 2011",2011,3518,"['Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'was', 'big', 'hit', '2003-2004', 'aging', 'actor', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'who', 'Tokyo', 'doing', 'commercials', 'week', 'homelife', 'mundane', 'experiencing', 'bit', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'attractive', '20-something', 'woman', 'Charlotte', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'Tokyo', 'photog', 'husband', 'gone', 'most', 'time', 'granted.This', 'mature', 'one-of-a-kind', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'right', 'mode', 'maturity', 'level', 'appreciate', 'said', 'maturity', 'level', 'not', 'age', 'people', 'are', 'pretty', 'mature', '16', 'others', 'are', 'completely', 'immature', '50', 'did', ""n't"", 'view', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'worked', 'story', 'music', 'visuals', 'pulled', 'character', 'temporary', 'world', '104-minute', 'runtime.The', 'film', 'amusing', 'social', 'commentary', 'deep', 'love', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'visual/musical', 'delight', ""'ll"", 'only', 'focus', 'deep', 'love', 'element', 'been', 'noted', 'story', 'orginated', 'writer/director', 'Sofia', 'experiences', 'aging', 'actor', 'possibly', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Sofia', 'obviously', 'Charlotte', 'Charlotte', 'husband', 'Sofia', 'ex', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'role', 'other', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'real', 'life', 'lot', 'reality', 'picture.But', 'not', 'just', 'cathartic', 'piece', 'Sofia', 'powerful', 'insights', 'offer', 'nature', 'true', 'romantic', 'love', 'one', 'love', 'transcends', 'age', 'difference', 'Bob', '30', 'years', 'older', 'Charlotte', 'possible', 'be', 'married', 'experience', 'romantic', 'love', 'Not', 'ever', 'adultery', 'just', 'fact', 'story', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'comfortable', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'other', 'how', 'look', 'other', 'eyes', 'windows', 'soul', 'profoundly', 'naked', 'sense', 'can', 'happen', 'flash', 'moment', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'just', 'KNOW', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'period', 'time', 'case', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'handful', 'days', 'see', 'same', 'things', 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'English', 'conundrum', 'Bob', 'Bob', 'could', 'take', 'advantage', 'Charlotte', 'so', 'lonely', 'sea', 'people', 'one', 'movie', 'themes', 'also', 'inexperienced', 'vunerable', 'Will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'advantage', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'further', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film.If', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'mention', 'wife', 'why', 'have', 'one-night', 'stand', 'lounge', 'singer', 'Bob', 'slept', 'singer', 'release', 'sexual', 'tension', 'had', 'been', 'building', 'up', 'Charlotte', 'was', 'moral', 'failure', 'keep', 'mind', 'was', 'drunk', 'failure', 'have', 'pity', 'was', 'going', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'obvious', 'deeper', 'Bob', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'advantage', 'Charlotte', 'wanted', 'did', ""n't"", 'genuinely', 'loved', 'revealed', 'end', 'Bob', 'could', 'sleep', 'singer', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'not', 'actions', 'Simply', 'put', 'true', 'love', 'sexual', 'expression', 'sexual', 'union', 'not', 'equal', 'love.The', 'ending', 'powerful', 'tear-inducing', 'CGI', 'explosion', 'action', 'stunt', 'can', 'compare', 'just', 'older', 'man', 'too-young', 'woman', 'embracing', 'midst', '20', 'million', 'Tears', 'flow', 'kisses', 'are', 'given', 'unheard', 'words', 'are', 'whispered', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'couple', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'married', 'know', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'never', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'love', 'been', 'expressed', 'will', 'be', 'treasured', 'eternity']",Lost in Translation

And how they try to get along on a common thread.Some of the scenes looks to be making fun of the Japanese:  But they are not, cultural differences always makes one look funnier and weird when compared to the other.Having been to Korea, I feel that the translation scenes were  exactly the same as what we practically experience.  I used to go to these meetings where my customer would talk what seemed to me like 10 lines and the translator would explain to me in 1 line and then I would ask her 'Are you sure - thats all what he said ?'These are some of the things which have been very well captured in the movie.The background Music is great, goes very well with the movie.",5,"Plotless, actionless, slow moving - but still an excellent movie",1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,990,"['very', 'subtle', 'movie', 'something', 'want', 'watch', 'calm', 'day', 'just', 'relax.It', 'two', 'people', 'One', 'young', 'bored', 'woman', 'Hotel', 'who', 'spend', 'time', 'ikebana', 'spending', 'time', 'bar', 'smoking', 'husband', 'hates', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'feeling', 'lost', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'how', 'try', 'get', 'along', 'common', 'thread.Some', 'scenes', 'be', 'making', 'fun', 'Japanese', 'are', 'not', 'cultural', 'differences', 'always', 'one', 'look', 'funnier', 'weird', 'when', 'compared', 'other.Having', 'been', 'Korea', 'feel', 'translation', 'scenes', 'were', 'exactly', 'same', 'what', 'practically', 'experience', 'used', 'go', 'meetings', 'where', 'customer', 'would', 'talk', 'what', 'seemed', '10', 'lines', 'translator', 'would', 'explain', '1', 'line', 'then', 'would', 'ask', 'sure', 'thats', 'what', 'said', ""'These"", 'are', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'well', 'captured', 'movie.The', 'background', 'Music', 'great', 'very', 'well', 'movie']",Lost in Translation
619904,A2GR3LJ5HEYY1M,B00005JMJ4,xyz,"[0, 0]","There were times during the movie when I felt I was watching a travel show sponsored by the Japanese tourism board. The ""wowing"" Japanese urban background, elegant hotel sets and the overall exotic environs surely feel fresh. Together with little presence of American actors (besides of course the male and female leads), they also effortlessly transport the audience to the foreign territory and switch our mindset from one of an, well, audience to that of a tourist.To complete the picture, the movie also lets the audience experience the cultural shocks, but in a rather derisive manner to the Japanese: A doctor who keeps speaking Japanese in a totally vain hope that his politeness would make his American listener understand his diagnosis. Even a translator doesn't have enough mastery of English to get a commercial director's message across to her American client. A prostitute could not even properly say the word ""rip."" On a rare occasion when the movie does not seek to cultural-shock the audience with a language joke, a Japanese teenager is spotted reading a pornographic comic in the public.To be fair, all those depictions are not exaggerated in the movie as they do happen the same way in real-life Japan. But like the exotic photography, the amusement derived from those jokes wears thin. Too thin to warrant their repeated usage in the movie.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver a great performance. Their characters show their subtle appreciation of each other's company while their mutual feelings are ever closer to the boiling point. Sometimes it seems a mere touch or a lingering stare is what it needs to bring the feelings to the boil.However, the over-reliance on the two actors and the set location renders the movie lacking its core support. This movie is mood-driven, which itself I have no problem with. In order to create the mood, the movie relies on a lot of short scenes. With little story, longer scenes would have plunged the movie into boredom. But also because of little story, the short scenes sometimes feel incoherent and they are linked together only by a weak thread of mood. This thread is weak in this movie because the mood is mainly generated by location-specific factors such as the exotic scenery and foreign faces. But as I have just mentioned, these things wear thin. If you like mood pieces set in Japan, I'd recommend some really good Japanese made TV series in mid 1990's (e.g., Long Vacation).Although I really like the ending scene - touching without sentimentality, the movie in the end feels empty and in a sense, distant. One good thing is the director utilizes very well the location to craft the mood; one bad thing is the location is relied on much too heavily for the good of the film.",3,Moody but ultimately less than satisfying,1080518400,"03 29, 2004",2004,2754,"['were', 'times', 'movie', 'when', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'travel', 'show', 'sponsored', 'Japanese', 'tourism', 'board', 'wowing', 'Japanese', 'urban', 'background', 'elegant', 'hotel', 'sets', 'overall', 'exotic', 'environs', 'surely', 'feel', 'fresh', 'Together', 'little', 'presence', 'American', 'actors', 'course', 'male', 'female', 'leads', 'also', 'effortlessly', 'transport', 'audience', 'foreign', 'territory', 'switch', 'mindset', 'one', 'well', 'audience', 'tourist.To', 'complete', 'picture', 'movie', 'also', 'audience', 'experience', 'cultural', 'shocks', 'rather', 'derisive', 'manner', 'Japanese', 'doctor', 'who', 'speaking', 'Japanese', 'totally', 'vain', 'hope', 'politeness', 'would', 'make', 'American', 'listener', 'diagnosis', 'Even', 'translator', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'mastery', 'English', 'get', 'commercial', 'director', 'message', 'American', 'client', 'prostitute', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'properly', 'say', 'word', 'rip', 'rare', 'occasion', 'when', 'movie', 'not', 'seek', 'cultural-shock', 'audience', 'language', 'joke', 'Japanese', 'teenager', 'spotted', 'reading', 'pornographic', 'comic', 'public.To', 'be', 'fair', 'depictions', 'are', 'not', 'exaggerated', 'movie', 'do', 'happen', 'same', 'way', 'real-life', 'Japan', 'exotic', 'photography', 'amusement', 'derived', 'jokes', 'wears', 'thin', 'Too', 'thin', 'warrant', 'repeated', 'usage', 'movie.Bill', 'Murray', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'deliver', 'great', 'performance', 'characters', 'show', 'subtle', 'appreciation', 'other', 'company', 'mutual', 'feelings', 'are', 'ever', 'closer', 'boiling', 'point', 'mere', 'touch', 'lingering', 'stare', 'what', 'bring', 'feelings', 'boil.However', 'over-reliance', 'two', 'actors', 'set', 'location', 'movie', 'lacking', 'core', 'support', 'movie', 'mood-driven', 'have', 'problem', 'order', 'create', 'mood', 'movie', 'lot', 'short', 'scenes', 'little', 'story', 'longer', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'plunged', 'movie', 'boredom', 'also', 'little', 'story', 'short', 'scenes', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'incoherent', 'are', 'linked', 'together', 'only', 'weak', 'thread', 'mood', 'thread', 'weak', 'movie', 'mood', 'mainly', 'generated', 'location-specific', 'factors', 'such', 'exotic', 'scenery', 'foreign', 'have', 'just', 'mentioned', 'things', 'wear', 'thin', 'like', 'mood', 'pieces', 'set', 'Japan', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'really', 'good', 'Japanese', 'made', 'TV', 'series', 'mid', '1990', 'e.g.', 'Long', 'Vacation', 'really', 'ending', 'scene', 'touching', 'sentimentality', 'movie', 'end', 'empty', 'sense', 'distant', 'One', 'good', 'thing', 'director', 'utilizes', 'very', 'well', 'location', 'craft', 'mood', 'one', 'bad', 'thing', 'location', 'relied', 'much', 'too', 'heavily', 'good', 'film']",Lost in Translation

The film started out great but the excitement gradually faded and became a bit boring. To me there were too many scenes in the hotel that built up on the  lonliness that just became too depressing. To the foreign eye, all of the scenes of Japan must've looked mysterious and beautiful. I think the cinematography was great and there were many beautiful scenes, but it seemed so fragmented. It's like okay here we have a scene in a buddist temple, next we have a scene of a wedding couple in kimonos in Kyoto, next... being japanese these scenes to me were like post card images and didn't really contribute to the plot of the movie. I'd imagine they had to do alot of guerilla filming around Tokyo because it's not easy getting permits to shoot large productions in public areas here. I appreciated the kind of relationship Bob and Charlotte had where they couldn't (or he couldn't) cross the line to become more than great friends, however I think the developement of the intimacy between the two suffered because alot of the time was devoted to trying to show the japanese culture. Don't get me wrong, this film probably had the most accurate coverage of what life in this city looks like (except for the lap dancing joint which looked alot more like someone's imagination).  Great film in terms of cinematography, music, tension, and bringing out the exotic feel of Japan,  but I think it may be a bit overrated as for being nominated for best Oscar picture.",4,a view from a japanese audience,1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,1681,"['am', 'japanese', 'who', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'japanese', 'american', 'cultures', 'when', 'heard', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'Tokyo', 'sometime', '2004', 'therefore', 'bought', 'dvd', 'film', 'started', 'out', 'great', 'excitement', 'gradually', 'faded', 'became', 'bit', 'boring', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'hotel', 'built', 'up', 'lonliness', 'just', 'became', 'too', 'depressing', 'foreign', 'eye', 'scenes', 'Japan', 'must', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'mysterious', 'beautiful', 'think', 'cinematography', 'was', 'great', 'were', 'many', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'so', 'fragmented', 'okay', 'here', 'have', 'scene', 'buddist', 'temple', 'have', 'scene', 'wedding', 'couple', 'kimonos', 'Kyoto', 'next', 'being', 'japanese', 'scenes', 'were', 'like', 'post', 'card', 'images', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'contribute', 'plot', 'movie', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'had', 'do', 'alot', 'guerilla', 'filming', 'Tokyo', 'not', 'easy', 'getting', 'permits', 'shoot', 'large', 'productions', 'public', 'areas', 'here', 'appreciated', 'kind', 'relationship', 'Bob', 'Charlotte', 'had', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'could', ""n't"", 'cross', 'line', 'become', 'more', 'great', 'friends', 'however', 'think', 'developement', 'intimacy', 'two', 'suffered', 'alot', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'trying', 'show', 'japanese', 'culture', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'film', 'probably', 'had', 'most', 'accurate', 'coverage', 'what', 'life', 'city', 'lap', 'dancing', 'joint', 'looked', 'alot', 'more', 'someone', 'imagination', 'Great', 'film', 'terms', 'cinematography', 'music', 'tension', 'bringing', 'out', 'exotic', 'feel', 'Japan', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'overrated', 'being', 'nominated', 'best', 'Oscar', 'picture']",Lost in Translation

This movie comes across like a pouting super-model, beautiful and fashionable and sophisticated looking but attempt to scratch the surface and you will find less than a fingernail's depth.  The ennui of the idle rich.Bored and rich are the characters in this film.  Bored with their treasures so undeservedly received, as in the case of Bob's million-dollar commercial.  Bored with being rich enough to not require an occupation, but trying to pass the hours in some fashion, as with Charlotte.  Bored with the expensive hotels, the dives, the temples, their families. Really, there is nothing that cannot bore this boring duo.  Ennui at its most self-indulgent.I have no problem with a slow storytelling style, or understated and unspoken dialog.  I am a huge fan of Ozu, and I know how a master craftsperson can manipulate emotions using a minimal of stimulus.  However, as the saying goes, Sofia Coppola is no Ozu.  Her storytelling lacks the depth necessary for that style, and it comes off as an affectation.Shallow as &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is, there are some redeeming qualities.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver a find performances, the best possible when working with such material.  The visuals are lovely, and one can almost catalog the influences director by director.The treatment of Japan has often been called racist, but, aside from the prostitute scene, I don't think so.  It is no more racist than &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; and presents about as accurate a portrait of the country and its people.  Don't come to Tokyo expecting to find what you see in this movie.Its too bad that the staff didn't go with their initial impulse, and fire Sofia Coppola and bring on a more talented director.

We're supposed to feel the pain and confusion of these two lost souls, one a recent graduate who has yet to define her life outside of a tag-along wife, and the second a famous actor whose mid-life circumstance leaves him richer than God but a shadow of his artistic past.  Neither is content in their career, their life, their marriage, or their future.  In finding each other they enjoy a nice respite in their otherwise noxious lives.  The problem is, these two are losers.  Instead of trying to correct their problems, they wallow in them.  Instead of improving themselves, they blame everything around them.  Tokyo stinks.  Japan stinks.  Wanna go home.  What a pair of sniveling whiners.  Fundamentally, how can anyone be sympathetic to two characters that have the opportunity to explore and immerse themselves in a different culture and face their challenges head on, who instead wallow in cigarettes and alcohol until happenstance brings these two losers together?  So what if it's a commentary on fleeting relationships?  A fleeting relationship between two annoying people is still annoying.Second, execution.  Apparently this was supposed to be a comedy.  I didn't laugh once.  Some of the jokes were tired (Japanese guy talks for 3 minutes at 100 words/min, translation is ""turn your head"" - boy, that's original); some were lame (Bill Murray getting interviewed by gay talk show host); most were simply not funny (that ridiculous Britney Spears/LA caricature starlet comes to mind).  And make no mistake, this movie drags (if 10 minutes of lousy Karaoke singing is your thing, this is your movie.  I got tired after the first 3)...And it drags... (at least 8 shot of our two protagonists watching subtitled TV at 4 am.  Riviting.)And it drags... (there is a completely useless scene of Bill playing golf with Mt Fuji in the background.  Beautiful scene, but it lasts 2 minutes and has NOTHING to do with ANYTHING - couldn't they work the beautiful shots into something?  Like a plot?)This movie in no way deserved its awards or nominations.  It was not good.  There are far better movies, far more intellectual and better made, and without a doubt Daddy's influence alone pushed this movie along.  However, some of the shots are good, Bill does an adequate job acting, and truthfully as a date-movie it works (at least it did for me).Oh, and that mysterious ending?  Since the whole point of the film was explore the nature of deep but fleeting relationships, clearly Bill told Scarlett that he will always remember the impression she made on him and their time in Japan.  Clearly she was upset at the lack of closure before he came up to her, and completely relieved afterwards.  Was it THAT hard to understand?  Was it really that mysterious?

619909,A3LBB8Y6FSMRBH,B00005JMJ4,"zinotrope ""zinotrope""","[4, 9]","First of all, this is certainly not a movie for everyone.  It is dreamlike, hypnotic, atmospheric and quiet and makes no pretense to being some great statement or telling some great parable.  It is impressionistic, and meant to be something you slide in to, not something that beats you over the head.  That being said, I do also feel like some people were disappointed in it because they expected either:1. A ""Bill Murray"" movie (i.e. Groundhog Day, Scrooged)2. A ""Romantic Comedy"" (i.e. most Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts movies)It is neither.Looking back on the movie, I think the most telling sign of where it was going was the inclusion of many Kevin Shields/My Bloody Valentine tracks during the film.  MBV (a group that people also loved or hated) worked on the idea that all of the instruments, voices included, were equally important and shouldn't necessarily stand out in the mix.  This seems to be the idea behind Lost In Translation, where the setting, the actors, the characters, and the plot are all equally important (or unimportant) and not meant to take precedence.  What you're left with, if you connect with it, is a memory of a couple specific moments (notably the karaoke scene and the crazy Japanese talk show, which are two true ""set pieces"" of any length), and more a mood that ""Lost"" has set and a chance to wonder what these people actually found, because it's clear they never figured that out completely.  It is romantic, but not a cut-and-dry romance like most formualic ""romantic"" movies.  It's not a perfect movie (it does have even slower spots in an already slow film), and I might have liked to have a commentary track, although the bonus interview shows Sofia Coppola to be less than magnetic and interesting.

It draws you into this fantastic dreamy world filled with rained soaked heavy clouded sky and shimmering distant city lights.  I felt like I was trapped in this enormously beautiful hotel in the middle of nowhere, far away from home.  Having been left in many a hotel across the country by my father on business trips, I identified with Scarlett Johanssen's character.  ""Lost in Translation"" translates to ""Lost Souls"", in my analogy of the film.  Both of the characters seemed to be jaded to some degree and both suffered from manic depression that seemed to be untreated. ""Lost in Translation"" has the charm and mysterious intrigue of the Japanese culture (which I happen to be fascinated by), and has a soothing pace and temperment that subtlely mesmorizes.  This film has become one of my all time faves. Brilliant directing as well, Sofia Coppola shocked the hell out of me with this.",5,My Happy Ending,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,945,"['humble', 'oppinion', 'think', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'fantastic', 'dreamy', 'world', 'filled', 'rained', 'soaked', 'heavy', 'clouded', 'sky', 'shimmering', 'distant', 'city', 'lights', 'felt', 'was', 'trapped', 'enormously', 'beautiful', 'hotel', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'far', 'away', 'home', 'Having', 'been', 'left', 'many', 'hotel', 'country', 'father', 'business', 'trips', 'identified', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'character', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Lost', 'Souls', 'analogy', 'film', 'characters', 'seemed', 'be', 'jaded', 'degree', 'suffered', 'manic', 'depression', 'seemed', 'be', 'untreated', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'charm', 'mysterious', 'intrigue', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'happen', 'be', 'fascinated', 'soothing', 'pace', 'temperment', 'subtlely', 'film', 'become', 'one', 'time', 'faves', 'Brilliant', 'directing', 'as', 'well', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'shocked', 'hell']",Lost in Translation

IT IS A COMMENTARY ON THE SEPARATION THAT EXISTS IN A POST-MODERN WORLD FROM A DIRECTOR WHO IS THOROUGHLY POST-MODERN IN HER WORLD-VIEW.We've seen this before, many times, from Woody Allen.  But Allen's movies, particularly his classics &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and later works such as &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; and &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;, contain characters that are relatable.  Somehow, we care about them, or are at least interested in the outcome of the plot.  I REVISIT WOODY ALLEN'S BEST MOVIES EVERY FEW YEARS.  I DON'T THINK THAT I'LL EVER GO BACK TO THIS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS WELL-DIRECTED AND WELL-ACTED.  I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS.While the acting performances are fine in Lost in Translation, and many of the situations are humerous, the characters are not endearing.  THE CHARACTERS ARE SO LONELY THAT THEY'RE JUST BLAH.  For instance, it is a thoroughly appropriate reflection of Copolla's post-modern philosophy that the characters not end up together at the end of the movie.  But the characters are so boring that I didn't care one way or the other.",3,It's okay--and maybe that's just what they want me to think,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,1224,"['movie', ""n't"", 'intended', 'be', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'intended', 'provoke', 'think', 'loneliness', 'IT', 'A', 'COMMENTARY', 'ON', 'THE', 'SEPARATION', 'THAT', 'EXISTS', 'IN', 'A', 'POST-MODERN', 'WORLD', 'FROM', 'A', 'DIRECTOR', 'WHO', 'THOROUGHLY', 'POST-MODERN', 'IN', 'HER', 'WORLD-VIEW.We', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Allen', 'movies', 'particularly', 'classics', 'quot', 'Manhattan', 'quot', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'later', 'works', 'such', 'quot', 'Hannah', 'Her', 'Sisters', 'quot', 'quot', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'quot', 'contain', 'characters', 'are', 'relatable', 'Somehow', 'care', 'are', 'least', 'interested', 'outcome', 'plot', 'REVISIT', 'WOODY', 'ALLEN', 'BEST', 'MOVIES', 'EVERY', 'FEW', 'YEARS', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'THINK', ""'LL"", 'EVER', 'GO', 'BACK', 'TO', 'THIS', 'EVEN', 'THOUGH', 'IT', 'IS', 'WELL-DIRECTED', 'AND', 'WELL-ACTED', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'CARE', 'ABOUT', 'THE', 'CHARACTERS.While', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'many', 'situations', 'are', 'humerous', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'endearing', 'CHARACTERS', 'ARE', 'SO', 'LONELY', 'THEY', ""'RE"", 'JUST', 'BLAH', 'instance', 'thoroughly', 'appropriate', 'reflection', 'Copolla', 'post-modern', 'philosophy', 'characters', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'end', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'one', 'way', 'other']",Lost in Translation
