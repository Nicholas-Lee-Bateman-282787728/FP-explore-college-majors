669778,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00005NQGR,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[157, 161]","The philosophy of all videos in the Crunch line is to make working out accessible to all people, regardless of size or experience. Their yoga videos are no exception, as they take a non-mystical approach and are taught in a very straightforward manner by instructor Sara Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe's down-to-earth style (she frequently uses words like ""scooch"") is completely non-intimidating; she comes across as a friendly workout buddy.Joy of Yoga begins with a focused breathing series involving forward bends and down dogs (there are many repetitions of this position) and then moves on to additional standing poses, including warrior, lunges, and twists. The floor portion of the workout consists mostly of relaxing stretches, but there is one tough segment which alternates arm/leg stretches with yogi pushups.  This practice is about 35 minutes long.  Fat-burning yoga is a more active practice, although not quite to the level of aerobic conditioning or power yoga.  Again, the practice begins with breathing and then introduces the use of vinyasas:  several poses are combined together in a flowing sequence and then the entire sequence is repeated several times.  After a brief warm-up, there is a long, sun salutation-type vinyasa containing lunges, push-up pose, simple backbends, and many repetitions of downward dog. For each repetition, a slightly more difficult variation is introduced, and by the end of this series, your arms and shoulders have gotten an intense workout.  Additional vinyasas include twisting lunges, proud warrior, triangle, and side angle pose.  This practice ends with a short abs section containing a few boat poses, seated backbends, and two Pilates-like exercises. Finally, there are some brief seated stretches and an even briefer relaxation pose for about 45 total minutes.Ivanhoe's cues are detailed enough for those new to yoga, and both practices are probably doable by most beginners, especially with the modifications provided.  However, for complete yoga novices, I think that some prior familiarity with basic yoga postures would be beneficial.  Also, it is important to keep in mind that both of these practices contain some fairly intense moves which demand some pre-existing fitness capacity; Fat-Burning Yoga in particular is a more strenuous practice that will challenge even intermediate yogis.  Finally, Ivanhoe's strong emphasis on breathing is a plus for all levels of yoga practitioners, and those who like her friendly, no-nonsense style are likely to enjoy these videos.",4,Two very good yoga practices for beginners/intermediates,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,2523,"['philosophy', 'videos', 'Crunch', 'line', 'make', 'working', 'out', 'accessible', 'people', 'regardless', 'size', 'experience', 'yoga', 'videos', 'are', 'exception', 'take', 'non-mystical', 'approach', 'are', 'taught', 'very', 'straightforward', 'manner', 'instructor', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'Ivanhoe', 'down-to-earth', 'style', 'frequently', 'words', 'scooch', 'completely', 'non-intimidating', 'across', 'friendly', 'workout', 'buddy.Joy', 'Yoga', 'focused', 'breathing', 'series', 'involving', 'forward', 'bends', 'down', 'dogs', 'are', 'many', 'repetitions', 'position', 'then', 'moves', 'additional', 'standing', 'poses', 'including', 'warrior', 'lunges', 'twists', 'floor', 'portion', 'workout', 'mostly', 'relaxing', 'stretches', 'one', 'tough', 'segment', 'arm/leg', 'stretches', 'yogi', 'pushups', 'practice', '35', 'minutes', 'long', 'Fat-burning', 'yoga', 'more', 'active', 'practice', 'not', 'quite', 'level', 'aerobic', 'conditioning', 'power', 'yoga', 'Again', 'practice', 'breathing', 'then', 'use', 'vinyasas', 'several', 'poses', 'are', 'combined', 'together', 'flowing', 'sequence', 'then', 'entire', 'sequence', 'repeated', 'several', 'times', 'brief', 'warm-up', 'long', 'sun', 'salutation-type', 'vinyasa', 'containing', 'lunges', 'push-up', 'pose', 'simple', 'backbends', 'many', 'repetitions', 'downward', 'dog', 'repetition', 'slightly', 'more', 'difficult', 'variation', 'introduced', 'end', 'series', 'arms', 'shoulders', 'have', 'gotten', 'intense', 'workout', 'Additional', 'vinyasas', 'include', 'twisting', 'lunges', 'proud', 'warrior', 'triangle', 'side', 'angle', 'pose', 'practice', 'short', 'abs', 'section', 'containing', 'few', 'boat', 'poses', 'seated', 'backbends', 'two', 'Pilates-like', 'exercises', 'Finally', 'are', 'brief', 'seated', 'stretches', 'even', 'briefer', 'relaxation', 'pose', '45', 'total', 'minutes.Ivanhoe', 'cues', 'are', 'detailed', 'enough', 'new', 'yoga', 'practices', 'are', 'probably', 'doable', 'most', 'beginners', 'especially', 'modifications', 'provided', 'However', 'complete', 'yoga', 'novices', 'think', 'prior', 'familiarity', 'basic', 'yoga', 'postures', 'would', 'be', 'beneficial', 'Also', 'important', 'keep', 'mind', 'practices', 'contain', 'fairly', 'intense', 'moves', 'demand', 'pre-existing', 'fitness', 'capacity', 'Fat-Burning', 'Yoga', 'particular', 'more', 'strenuous', 'practice', 'will', 'challenge', 'even', 'intermediate', 'yogis', 'Finally', 'Ivanhoe', 'strong', 'emphasis', 'breathing', 'plus', 'levels', 'yoga', 'practitioners', 'who', 'friendly', 'no-nonsense', 'style', 'are', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'videos']",Crunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout: The Joy of Yoga & Fat-Burning Yoga

669784,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B00005NQGR,CPTScott,"[26, 27]","I have already done individual reviews of the two practices contained in this DVD but I wanted to give an overview of the combined practices found on this excellent DVD.By way of background, I have been practicing Yoga daily for over 9 years, with a large library of yoga VHS/DVD/CD (around 100). I also have been studying for many years with an excellent Yoga teacher, but that's only once a week so the heart of my Yoga practice is at home w/ my collection of Various Yoga media.This DVD contains two practices, led by Yoga teacher Sara Ivanhoe, and is an excellent pair of routines. The first, ""Joy of Yoga"" is more basic, a good introduction to Yoga. The second,""Fat Burning Yoga"" has more of a Vinyasa flow style to it (more of a ""Power Yoga"" feel). It is a challenging but doable program that is around 40 or so minutes long.I feel that Sara particularly shines as a teacher in the second (""Fat Burning"") program, but of course that may just be personal preference because I tend to like those more challenging, flowing types of practice which really build heat in the body.I want to say a bit more about the ""Fat Burning"" program.The routine is extremely well put together. The poses build gradually starting with simpler movements that warm you up and gently take you into the more challenging versions of the poses from one series to the next.She has a student who demonstrates modifications which is always quite important for a program like this where you may have a person who has never done yoga before or who may have physical limitations.This is a very thorough routine which leads you through a wide range of motion and also incorporates a really wonderful flow.My only miniscule complaint would be that I prefer a longer guided relaxation before the final seated pose, but of course one can always just shut off the program to extend their relaxation and then put it back on to finish it off in sitting. This in and of itself wasn't a big deal because there is still at least some semblence of relaxation (which is treated gratuitously in many programs).Highly recommended!Namaste",5,Two Excellent Yoga Practices on One DVD,1141862400,"03 9, 2006",2006,2097,"['have', 'already', 'done', 'individual', 'reviews', 'two', 'practices', 'contained', 'DVD', 'wanted', 'give', 'overview', 'combined', 'practices', 'found', 'excellent', 'DVD.By', 'way', 'background', 'have', 'been', 'practicing', 'Yoga', 'daily', '9', 'years', 'large', 'library', 'yoga', 'VHS/DVD/CD', '100', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'studying', 'many', 'years', 'excellent', 'Yoga', 'teacher', 'only', 'once', 'week', 'so', 'heart', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'home', 'w/', 'collection', 'Various', 'Yoga', 'media.This', 'DVD', 'two', 'practices', 'led', 'Yoga', 'teacher', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'excellent', 'pair', 'routines', 'first', 'Joy', 'Yoga', 'more', 'basic', 'good', 'introduction', 'Yoga', 'second', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Yoga', 'more', 'Vinyasa', 'flow', 'style', 'more', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'feel', 'challenging', 'doable', 'program', 'around', '40', 'so', 'minutes', 'long.I', 'feel', 'Sara', 'particularly', 'teacher', 'second', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'program', 'course', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'personal', 'preference', 'tend', 'like', 'more', 'challenging', 'flowing', 'types', 'practice', 'really', 'build', 'heat', 'body.I', 'want', 'say', 'bit', 'more', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'program.The', 'routine', 'extremely', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'poses', 'build', 'gradually', 'starting', 'simpler', 'movements', 'warm', 'gently', 'take', 'more', 'challenging', 'versions', 'poses', 'one', 'series', 'next.She', 'student', 'who', 'modifications', 'always', 'quite', 'important', 'program', 'where', 'may', 'have', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'done', 'yoga', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'physical', 'limitations.This', 'very', 'thorough', 'routine', 'wide', 'range', 'motion', 'also', 'really', 'wonderful', 'flow.My', 'only', 'miniscule', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'prefer', 'longer', 'guided', 'relaxation', 'final', 'seated', 'pose', 'course', 'one', 'can', 'always', 'just', 'shut', 'off', 'program', 'extend', 'relaxation', 'then', 'put', 'back', 'finish', 'off', 'sitting', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'still', 'least', 'semblence', 'relaxation', 'treated', 'gratuitously', 'many', 'programs', '.Highly', 'recommended', 'Namaste']",Crunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout: The Joy of Yoga & Fat-Burning Yoga

There's no chanting, or mystics on top of mountaintops, or any of that--and that can be reassuring to those just starting up with yoga.This is a beginning yoga video, although I think it's aimed at an audience that's already fairly physically fit. There are some poses which may be difficult for someone who is not particularly strong yet. Yet, I am about intermediate level, and while I don't find this as challenging as videos aimed at intermediate students, I find I get a workout that feels like I've ""done something"". At about 40 minutes each segment (the Fat Burning Yoga is longer), it's easier to fit into a busy schedule than a 60- or 90- minute workout.One of the small pet peeves of this DVD is the instructor in the ""Fat Burning Yoga"" sequence...she's always saying, ""OK?"" in the sort of way some people do and are only half-aware they're doing. I find this verbal twitch annoying, although to be fair I can only imagine how nervous SHE must have been taping an exercise video.In short, I find this a video good for beginners, but perhaps more so for those who are in fairly good shape already.",4,Pretty darn good yoga workout,1012867200,"02 5, 2002",2002,1305,"['CRUNCH', 'Total', 'Yoga', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'approach', 'yoga', 'aimed', 'audience', 'who', 'fairly', 'comfortable', 'working', 'out', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'whole', 'yoga', 'craze', 'about', 'chanting', 'mystics', 'top', 'mountaintops', 'can', 'be', 'reassuring', 'just', 'starting', 'up', 'yoga.This', 'beginning', 'yoga', 'video', 'think', 'aimed', 'audience', 'already', 'fairly', 'physically', 'fit', 'are', 'poses', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'particularly', 'strong', 'yet', 'am', 'intermediate', 'level', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'as', 'challenging', 'videos', 'aimed', 'intermediate', 'students', 'find', 'get', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'done', 'something', '40', 'minutes', 'segment', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Yoga', 'longer', 'easier', 'fit', 'busy', 'schedule', '60-', '90-', 'minute', 'workout.One', 'small', 'pet', 'peeves', 'DVD', 'instructor', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Yoga', 'sequence', 'always', 'saying', 'OK', 'sort', 'way', 'people', 'do', 'are', 'only', 'half-aware', ""'re"", 'doing', 'find', 'verbal', 'twitch', 'annoying', 'be', 'fair', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'nervous', 'SHE', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'taping', 'exercise', 'video.In', 'short', 'find', 'video', 'good', 'beginners', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'who', 'are', 'fairly', 'good', 'shape', 'already']",Crunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout: The Joy of Yoga & Fat-Burning Yoga

Breathing is key in yoga!!!!  In both videos, there is someone who demonstrates modifications of the yoga posture.  So you can choose how to position your body depending on your flexibility and comfort--- essentially work at your pace!  Of course another appealing aspect of this video is that it is on DVD.  DVD's are fab!  You can quickly  jump around to different portions of the yoga routine--skipping certaining sections or just doing the ab workout, etc.The ""Joy of Yoga"" is a basic program focusing on leg stretches, like lunges, that would be good for runners (or after a long workout, stepping, etc.).  Other poses included are downward dog and warrior.  This program is approximately 30 minutes so it can easily fit into your busy schedule.The ""Fat Burning"" Yoga is a longer, slightly more advanced program.  Most of yoga poses demonstrated in this video focus on stretching the legs and back muscles (e.g. lunges, side stretches, triangle pose, downward dog, warrior pose, etc.).  At the end of the workout, Sara concludes with a six minute ab workout, stretches, and a brief relaxation meditation.

669806,ATKVDKXO3Q6ZM,B00005NQGR,Teedums,"[3, 3]","This DVD features 2 yoga workouts, The Joy of Yoga and Fat Burning Yoga both led by Sara Ivanhoe. She is a friendly, non intimidating, relaxed yoga instructor who's style I really like.Joy of Yoga is from 1997, Sara is with 7 fellow exercisers one who show beginner modifications and another one in the back who is quite flexible. You warm up with forward bends, side stretches and swan dives all while breathing in and out through your nose.  Sara always makes sure to emphasize the importance of breathing.  Then Sara will lead you through some standing poses, you will see lots of downward facing dogs in this routine, also high and low lunges, side stretch poses, and warriors with some added twists.  After that you will move to the floor where you will do some back bends and cobras, then move into downward facing dog again this time with legs in a wider stance where you will incorporate spinal twists. Then you finish on the floor with back extensions, pushups, forwards bends, seated twists and final relaxation pose.Fat Burning Yoga is a more recent video of Sara's and a little more intense.  She has 7 exercisers with her again, one showing beginner modifications. You will see a lot of the same poses, lots of downward facing dogs again, high and low lunges, twisting lunges, warrior, side stretch pose and some backbends including the cobra and bow pose. You will also see some planks, the chair pose and triangle pose. Sara will then lead you through a flowing series including some of these poses. Following that is an ab section where you will see the boat pose, 4-legged table pose and reverse planks, then you move into a few minutes of more pilates style ab work done at a slower pace. Then you will do some forward bend poses to stretch out before going on to the final relaxation pose.These are better suited for beginner/intermediate yoga people, if you are a complete beginner something else like Basic Yoga for Dummies which also features Sara may be a better choice. Sara does a decent job in both videos, she is pleasant, encouraging and seems to be enjoying herself. She is also featured in Candlelight Yoga which is another excellent video. If you like yoga, but aren't into the more traditional mystical yoga but a more relaxed style, these would be perfect for your collection.",5,2 solid programs for those new to yoga...,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,2309,"['DVD', '2', 'yoga', 'workouts', 'Joy', 'Yoga', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Yoga', 'led', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'friendly', 'non', 'intimidating', 'relaxed', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'who', 'style', 'really', 'Yoga', '1997', 'Sara', '7', 'fellow', 'exercisers', 'one', 'who', 'show', 'beginner', 'modifications', 'one', 'back', 'who', 'quite', 'flexible', 'warm', 'up', 'forward', 'bends', 'side', 'stretches', 'swan', 'dives', 'breathing', 'nose', 'Sara', 'always', 'sure', 'emphasize', 'importance', 'breathing', 'Then', 'Sara', 'will', 'lead', 'standing', 'poses', 'will', 'see', 'lots', 'downward', 'facing', 'dogs', 'routine', 'also', 'high', 'low', 'lunges', 'side', 'stretch', 'poses', 'warriors', 'added', 'twists', 'will', 'move', 'floor', 'where', 'will', 'do', 'back', 'bends', 'cobras', 'then', 'move', 'downward', 'facing', 'dog', 'again', 'time', 'legs', 'wider', 'stance', 'where', 'will', 'incorporate', 'spinal', 'twists', 'Then', 'finish', 'floor', 'back', 'extensions', 'pushups', 'forwards', 'bends', 'seated', 'twists', 'final', 'relaxation', 'pose.Fat', 'Burning', 'Yoga', 'more', 'recent', 'video', 'Sara', 'little', 'more', 'intense', '7', 'exercisers', 'again', 'one', 'showing', 'beginner', 'modifications', 'will', 'see', 'lot', 'same', 'poses', 'lots', 'downward', 'facing', 'dogs', 'again', 'high', 'low', 'lunges', 'twisting', 'lunges', 'warrior', 'side', 'stretch', 'pose', 'backbends', 'including', 'cobra', 'bow', 'pose', 'will', 'also', 'see', 'planks', 'chair', 'pose', 'triangle', 'pose', 'Sara', 'will', 'then', 'lead', 'flowing', 'series', 'including', 'poses', 'Following', 'ab', 'section', 'where', 'will', 'see', 'boat', 'pose', '4-legged', 'table', 'pose', 'reverse', 'planks', 'then', 'move', 'few', 'minutes', 'more', 'pilates', 'style', 'ab', 'work', 'done', 'slower', 'pace', 'Then', 'will', 'do', 'forward', 'bend', 'poses', 'stretch', 'out', 'going', 'final', 'relaxation', 'pose.These', 'are', 'better', 'suited', 'beginner/intermediate', 'yoga', 'people', 'are', 'complete', 'beginner', 'something', 'else', 'Basic', 'Yoga', 'Dummies', 'also', 'Sara', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'choice', 'Sara', 'decent', 'job', 'videos', 'pleasant', 'encouraging', 'be', 'enjoying', 'also', 'featured', 'Candlelight', 'Yoga', 'excellent', 'video', 'like', 'yoga', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'traditional', 'mystical', 'yoga', 'more', 'relaxed', 'style', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'collection']",Crunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout: The Joy of Yoga & Fat-Burning Yoga
669807,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B00005NQGR,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[13, 15]","Dr. Beth wrote a great review.Sara Ivanhoe is very friendly, but a bit stiff. Many times she'll say how hard everything is which is meant to be sympathetic, but comes off reminding me how much I'm working to lose weight instead of enjoying how good the poses feel themselves. She never stops talking which can be ok if to remind you to breathe or keep your back straight, but she talks off-topic atimes & too quick & stiff which keeps you from concentrating on your body.The background music can't be heard unless you listen for it which should be there to help you to relax. The colorful industral background was too gym lookiing.The workout was challenging & had some great twists, but it did not flow. This workout is more of a stiff slow aerobics then yoga. She does teach well, remembers most cues & details to make sure you do it right, doing each pose slowly at first to build it to a series which she repeats 2-4x. The poses were the basic sun salutations, forward bends, chair pose, downward dog, side angle, warrior 1 & 2, triangle pose, table, bow, locust, wide legged sretch, as well as some deep twisting poses.A past reviewer remarked she was new & it showed... During the side angle or triangle pose she said to use the hand at the floor as an anchor to keep you in the pose... Isn't the correct way to use your abdominal & leg muscles to hold you & just have lower arm as a slight balance, nothing more since the point is to extend the arms as much as possible?If you like the straight-foward do the pose & done, this is the DVD for you. If you like ones that are more relaxed with music being able to be heard to keep your breathing in tune, & the teacher being serene, try Rodney Yee, Rainbeau Mars, Wai Lana & others.There's a trailer at collagevideo com",3,"Good yoga workout, but stiff",1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,1773,"['Dr.', 'Beth', 'wrote', 'great', 'review.Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'very', 'friendly', 'bit', 'stiff', 'Many', 'times', ""'ll"", 'say', 'how', 'hard', 'everything', 'meant', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'off', 'reminding', 'how', 'much', ""'m"", 'working', 'lose', 'weight', 'instead', 'enjoying', 'how', 'good', 'poses', 'feel', 'never', 'talking', 'can', 'be', 'ok', 'remind', 'breathe', 'keep', 'back', 'straight', 'off-topic', 'atimes', 'too', 'quick', 'stiff', 'concentrating', 'body.The', 'background', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'heard', 'listen', 'should', 'be', 'there', 'help', 'relax', 'colorful', 'industral', 'background', 'was', 'too', 'gym', 'lookiing.The', 'workout', 'was', 'challenging', 'had', 'great', 'twists', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'workout', 'more', 'stiff', 'slow', 'aerobics', 'then', 'yoga', 'teach', 'well', 'remembers', 'most', 'cues', 'details', 'make', 'sure', 'do', 'right', 'doing', 'pose', 'slowly', 'first', 'build', 'series', '2-4x', 'poses', 'were', 'basic', 'sun', 'salutations', 'forward', 'chair', 'pose', 'downward', 'dog', 'side', 'angle', 'warrior', '1', '2', 'triangle', 'pose', 'table', 'bow', 'locust', 'wide', 'legged', 'sretch', 'as', 'well', 'deep', 'twisting', 'poses.A', 'reviewer', 'remarked', 'was', 'new', 'showed', 'side', 'angle', 'triangle', 'pose', 'said', 'use', 'hand', 'floor', 'anchor', 'keep', 'pose', ""n't"", 'correct', 'way', 'use', 'abdominal', 'leg', 'muscles', 'hold', 'just', 'have', 'lower', 'arm', 'slight', 'balance', 'nothing', 'more', 'point', 'extend', 'arms', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'like', 'straight-foward', 'do', 'pose', 'done', 'DVD', 'like', 'ones', 'are', 'more', 'relaxed', 'music', 'being', 'able', 'be', 'heard', 'keep', 'breathing', 'tune', 'teacher', 'being', 'serene', 'try', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'Wai', 'Lana', 'trailer', 'collagevideo', 'com']",Crunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout: The Joy of Yoga & Fat-Burning Yoga
