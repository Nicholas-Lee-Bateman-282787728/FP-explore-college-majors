The show seemed terribly exciting then and combined all the elements a child of that era could want.  It was like a crime drama, a western, and an action adventure show all rolled into one.This offering is four episodes over an undetermined run of the series. I suppose these are episodes that have been allowed to lapse into public domain. There is more than one version of the opening of the show one of which looks like an old rotary engined beechcraft.  The quality was quite watchable for showes of this vintage.  My only regret is these are only four episodes (which seem to be the only ones in circulation at this time) Buyer beware if you find another sky king DVD it will probably be the same ones. Hopefully more of this great old show will become available in the near future.

It didn't seem like Saturday without following the adventures of Kirby Grant as Arizona rancher Schuyler ""Sky"" King in his twin-engine Cessna 310-B, the coolest airplane on television.""Sky King"" could have become a forgotten television Western among the multitude of Westerns had it not been for the talents of one amazing actor named Gloria Winters.  She starred as Sky's petite, spunky, blonde niece Penny King. Gloria appeared in all 72 episodes of ""Sky King"" from 1952-1959, and played a major role in the show becoming the cult favorite that it is today.Unfortunately, there are only four episodes of ""Sky King"" that are in the public domain, and all of those episodes can be found in this nicely-designed Alpha Video collection. These same four episodes can also be found in other DVD budget sets, but this Alpha collection is one of the best.The four public domain episodes all feature Penny in key roles in each story. They are:1. ""Sky Robbers:""  After a robbery, Penny spots a man throwing a heavy sack into a plane just minutes before it takes off in an air race;2. ""A Dog Named Barney:""  Penny and her Uncle Sky help young Johnny find his seeing-eye dog after it mysteriously disappears;3. ""Bullet Bait:""  Penny and Sky host a wedding at their Flying Crown Ranch, but the groom fails to show up for the wedding;4. ""Wild Man:""  Penny befriends a notorious bearded loner who lives in a remote forest area, and who often interferes with loggers who try to cut down trees.And if you are interested in seeing Gloria Winters in some of her other TV roles during the Golden Age of Television, she can be found in a number of other affordable DVD collections from Amazon. Here's just a few:1. ""The Life of Riley:""  Eighteen-year-old Gloria Winters played daughter Babs Riley in this 1949-1950 TV sitcom. She appeared in 17 of the 26 episodes that starred Jackie Gleason as TV's first Chester A. Riley, a long-suffering blue-collar worker. Available on DVD from TGG Direct;2. ""The Gene Autry Show:""  Gloria appeared in a 1951 second season episode entitled ""Warning! Danger!""  She  plays Sue Miller, the younger sister of Dickie Jones (who later played Buffalo Bill, Jr.). Dickie is on the run from a gang of outlaws. Available in the DVD set ""The Gene Autry Show, Complete Season Two"" by Timeless Media Group;3. ""The Roy Rogers Show:"" Gloria plays Laraine Dunlap in this 1952 episode entitled ""The Hermit's Secret."" She is the daughter of an old rancher trying to hide his dark past. Available in the DVD collection ""Western TV Treasures (150 Television Classics)"" by Mill Creek Entertainment;4. ""Stories of the Century:""  Gloria is excellent in the lead role of the real-life female outlaw Jennie Stevens McCall known as ""Little Britches"" because she dressed in men's clothes. This episode from 1954 is available in ""Western TV Classics (150 Episodes)"" by Mill Creek, also in a ""Stories of the Century"" collection by St. Clair Video, and other sources;5. ""Richard Diamond, Private Detective:""  Gloria plays Jane Thomas, a showgirl who helps Diamond locate his old army buddy who has turned killer.
