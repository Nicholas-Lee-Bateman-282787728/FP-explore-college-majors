668642,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00005NGT4,Einsatz,"[1, 1]","This movie is dead slow, overly yappy, and wholly without suspense and/or tension.  They waste the best murder straight off and have nothing to show for it from that point on.  Worse, the so-called massacre involves a few couples only, hardly what one would classify as carnage on any level.  Plus, they are few and far between, which required a great deal of 'acting' from the few cast members to fill in the remainder of the time.  Let me tell you, no one from this cast ever became a star.  The acting involved was so imperceptible that it was practically subliminal!  As for the camera work, whoever was in charge left the darn thing parked more often than not, few edits were involved, the whole thing felt static.  The score was odd to say the least, half the time it was just noise for the sake of noise.

It did have bad acting, bad camera and bad writing, but it was a nice and solid slasher. It was released in 1976 and I think they did pretty will with the gore for that time. The deaths in the opening scene were the best and by far the bloodiest, but all of the rest still delivered. George ""Buck"" Flower co-wrote this movie and starred in an uncredited role, which brought a smile to my face.I think it is a must own for any fan of the slasher movie, and really, if you hate the movie it's only 70 minutes long (uncut) so, why not check it out?",3,"Very short,bloody watchable slasher from the 70's.",1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,1035,"['[', 'good', 'things', ']', 'really', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'nice', 'easy', 'unconfusing', 'plot', 'typical', 'slasher', 'film', 'film', 'introduced', 'few', 'suspects', 'even', 'plot', 'twist', 'was', 'pretty', 'easy', 'guess', 'couple', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'kills', 'run', 'time', 'was', 'mere', '70', 'minutes', '[', 'bad', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'camera', 'work', 'sub-par', 'dialogue', 'lacked', 'made', 'pretty', 'typical', 'genre', '[', 'final', 'thoughts', ']', 'Regardless', 'bad', 'film', 'really', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'seem', 'hate', 'really', 'liked', 'did', 'have', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'camera', 'bad', 'writing', 'was', 'nice', 'solid', 'slasher', 'was', 'released', '1976', 'think', 'did', 'pretty', 'will', 'gore', 'time', 'deaths', 'opening', 'scene', 'were', 'best', 'far', 'bloodiest', 'rest', 'still', 'delivered', 'George', 'Buck', 'Flower', 'co-wrote', 'movie', 'starred', 'uncredited', 'role', 'brought', 'smile', 'face.I', 'think', 'must', 'own', 'fan', 'slasher', 'movie', 'really', 'hate', 'movie', 'only', '70', 'minutes', 'long', 'uncut', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'check', 'out']",Drive in Massacre

Two cops investigate the murders and interview the manager of the theater and the very stupid assistant, former carnival sword swallower.""Drive in Massacre"" is a very talky movie. Most of it is pointless, bad dialogue. There are some murder scenes but no suspense. The cops follow up all sorts of false leads but the plot moves nowhere. Even though the movie is only 74 minutes long it feels very long and is padded with scenes that have little or nothing to do with the main plot.I like B movies when they're entertaining, but ""Drive in Massacre"" is just plain bad with no redeeming values or entertainment value. It's not ""so bad it's good"". In fact I think it might be one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen.

668646,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B00005NGT4,Sid the Elf,"[4, 6]","First off we find it pretty amazing (not in a good way) that this is only the third review done for a film made in 1974, both being within the last 3 years. For most that is a warning sign to steer clear. However for Sid that's what draws us in. Sure it doesn't make sense to most, but the quest for b often brings you to films of this caliber and sometimes gives you a classic. This was not one of those times. When you take gambles you also open yourself up to some big let downs and Drive in Massacre is one of those we'll hope to never see again.The film begins in the typical grainy 70's look as the sunsets and the local drive in opens up. Once the film starts rolling a couple looking to get a little randy winds up getting killed by a sword yielding maniac. Hey Dutch! It's the exact sword that pear shaped loser used to have. Anyway, this alerts two dim witted old investigators (one resembling John Madden) and they hit the scene of the crime. From here one out the film goes absolutely nowhere. It's pretty much the same scene over and over leaving you amped to hit the fast forward button quite often.So to Sum up Drive-In Massacre: stay away! Even if you're a huge fan of b, this will leave you virtually nothing to find enjoyment in. See for Sid we were born past the drive in times and never got to enjoy what seemed to be a great experience. Naturally you'd think it would make for a great horror atmosphere, but this one proved to be the contrary. In the world of b horror we like to try and broaden our horizons by finding some more obscure films from older time periods. This one was came up empty but that will never stop Sid. This one never would have made it back in the days and easily would have gotten passed up to watch Cow Tipping for a 5th time in one sitting.",1,A serial killer molded after the Dutchmaster himself,1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,1788,"['First', 'find', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'only', 'third', 'review', 'done', 'film', 'made', '1974', 'being', 'last', '3', 'years', 'most', 'warning', 'sign', 'steer', 'clear', 'However', 'Sid', 'what', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'most', 'quest', 'b', 'often', 'films', 'caliber', 'sometimes', 'classic', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'times', 'When', 'take', 'gambles', 'also', 'open', 'up', 'big', 'let', 'downs', 'Drive', 'Massacre', 'one', ""'ll"", 'hope', 'never', 'see', 'again.The', 'film', 'typical', 'grainy', '70', 'look', 'sunsets', 'local', 'drive', 'up', 'film', 'rolling', 'couple', 'looking', 'get', 'little', 'randy', 'up', 'getting', 'killed', 'sword', 'yielding', 'maniac', 'Hey', 'Dutch', 'exact', 'sword', 'pear', 'shaped', 'loser', 'used', 'have', 'Anyway', 'two', 'dim', 'witted', 'old', 'investigators', 'one', 'resembling', 'John', 'Madden', 'hit', 'scene', 'crime', 'here', 'one', 'film', 'absolutely', 'nowhere', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'scene', 'leaving', 'amped', 'hit', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'quite', 'often.So', 'Sum', 'up', 'Drive-In', 'Massacre', 'stay', 'away', 'Even', ""'re"", 'huge', 'fan', 'b', 'will', 'leave', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'See', 'Sid', 'were', 'born', 'drive', 'times', 'never', 'got', 'enjoy', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'great', 'experience', 'Naturally', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'horror', 'atmosphere', 'one', 'proved', 'be', 'contrary', 'world', 'b', 'horror', 'like', 'try', 'broaden', 'horizons', 'finding', 'more', 'obscure', 'films', 'older', 'time', 'periods', 'one', 'was', 'came', 'up', 'empty', 'will', 'never', 'stop', 'Sid', 'one', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'back', 'days', 'easily', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'passed', 'up', 'watch', 'Cow', 'Tipping', '5th', 'time', 'one', 'sitting']",Drive in Massacre
