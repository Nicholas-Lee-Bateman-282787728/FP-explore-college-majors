1435257,A3M1EKSN23SVOJ,B0050KTMVI,"DICK YORK IS THE BETTER DICK ""Sterculeus Erectus""","[1, 4]","The 5th Season oif MR ED pulled out all the special effects stops you could possibly do with a horse...very funny season. Short on intelligent plots but still very funny. This was the last good season and the last with neighbor Colonel kirkwoood. After this season the show brought in Carol's father but the show was out of ideas and was cancelled 13 episodes into the 6th season. Show was limited by being primarily for children by this time and by the limits of censorship in 1965 era. but get season 5 many funny episodes. I guess they will only release 13 episodes to complete the series on DVD ..and I hope at half the price since it is half a season. Pl FYI All seasons are uncut escept 8 prints from season one (thankfully of mainly unfunny episodes..why they used edited prints for those 8 episodes seems to have been a mistake they had the uncut films .but were unaware the prints they used were edited until AFTER they released the first season..oh well..and a Horse is a horse......I would love to see a POLITICAL remake of this show with the kind of raunchy and politcal comments from ED you could not get away with in 1965...EXAMPLE... Wilbur in front of neighbors ""MY friends I want to welcome all of you here tonight"" ED chimes in the background "" And  welcome All of you illegal border crossers  making my dinner.""  just an idea lol",5,Great season,1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,1348,"['5th', 'Season', 'oif', 'MR', 'ED', 'pulled', 'out', 'special', 'effects', 'stops', 'could', 'possibly', 'do', 'horse', 'very', 'funny', 'season', 'Short', 'intelligent', 'plots', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'was', 'last', 'good', 'season', 'last', 'neighbor', 'Colonel', 'kirkwoood', 'season', 'show', 'brought', 'Carol', 'father', 'show', 'was', 'ideas', 'was', 'cancelled', '13', 'episodes', '6th', 'season', 'Show', 'was', 'limited', 'being', 'primarily', 'children', 'time', 'limits', 'censorship', '1965', 'era', 'get', 'season', '5', 'many', 'funny', 'episodes', 'guess', 'will', 'only', 'release', '13', 'episodes', 'complete', 'series', 'DVD', '..and', 'hope', 'price', 'season', 'Pl', 'FYI', 'All', 'seasons', 'are', 'uncut', '8', 'prints', 'season', 'one', 'thankfully', 'mainly', 'unfunny', 'episodes..why', 'used', 'edited', 'prints', '8', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'mistake', 'had', 'uncut', 'films', 'were', 'unaware', 'prints', 'used', 'were', 'edited', 'AFTER', 'released', 'first', 'season..oh', 'well..and', 'Horse', 'horse', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'POLITICAL', 'remake', 'show', 'kind', 'raunchy', 'politcal', 'comments', 'ED', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'away', '1965', 'EXAMPLE', 'Wilbur', 'front', 'neighbors', 'MY', 'friends', 'want', 'welcome', 'here', 'tonight', 'ED', 'chimes', 'background', 'welcome', 'illegal', 'border', 'crossers', 'making', 'dinner', 'just', 'idea', 'lol']",Mister Ed: Season 5

If they would like to see the sales go UP on them, they would benefit from doing so, which should drop the price closer to the first 3 seasons... I'd buy them right now if they did and I'm sure a lot of others would too. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's held out on this and I have no intentions on buying unless Amazon does the selling.
