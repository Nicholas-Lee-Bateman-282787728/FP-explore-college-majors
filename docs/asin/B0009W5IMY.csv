The extras on the dvds are pretty good, and the clarity is great.  If you're looking for a gift for someone who likes Superman, this series tends to appeal to the teen-30-something range.  The newer seasons would appeal to the comic fans since we see more of Superman's fellow superheros show up (Yay Aquaman!).",5,"Wonderful series, good extras",1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,404,"['series', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'review', 'tell', ""'re"", 'browsing', 'item', 'extras', 'dvds', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'clarity', 'great', ""'re"", 'looking', 'gift', 'someone', 'who', 'Superman', 'series', 'appeal', 'teen-30-something', 'range', 'newer', 'seasons', 'would', 'appeal', 'comic', 'fans', 'see', 'more', 'Superman', 'fellow', 'superheros', 'show', 'up', 'Yay', 'Aquaman']",Smallville - The Complete First Four Seasons
914154,A3D5UHUD1CMTXG,B0009W5IMY,"Jacki ""Jack Mueller""","[1, 5]","It's been four years and poor teenager Clark Kent still can't accept the person he is suppose to become. It's pretty obvious when you are found near a spaceship in a cornfield after a meteor shower that you aren't from anywhere known to man. Taken in by a farmer and his wife, Ka-El is given the identity of Clark Kent, adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent. His life is easy going for awhile until a young Lex Luthor hits teenage Clark with his car taking both of them off a bridge. Performing a daring rescue is Clark's undoing. Lex becomes both indebted and curious to the happenings of how Clark was able to save his life. From then on the series unwines. Strange things occur which revolve around remaining meteor rocks left in Smallville, criminal activity arises, teenagers' and adults' lives like always, suck; espcially in their love lives, and very slowly does Clark's true destiny arise. The show is so slow and there is so much talking about how life is, the viewer soon realizes that this show is not really about Superman. The series is about a boy with a growing number of special powers and a future he is not willing to accept, no matter how much good he will do in the end. It takes two years to finally put Clark and Lana together, but they are later torn apart by Clark's disobedience to his father Jar-El. Clark eventually repairs the damage between his loved ones, but no matter how hard he tries, Lex and himself will never be the same. It takes over three years for Lex and Clark to finally quit being friends and to fall into conflicts with how they think the world should work. The show at least does follow some Superman storylines. Clark gains x-ray vision, heat vision, super speed, super hearing, super strength, flying abilities, a young Louis Lane appears, Perry White makes a stop in Smallville, so does the Flash, Krypto causes some havic, and Clark is only vulnrable to Kryptonite rocks. The episodes dealing with these Superman traits are the interesting ones because they are fun to see how they arise and how Clark learns to deal with them. But then there's the continuous and extremely repetitive teenage and adult life drama. How much school sucks because one isn't normal, disfunctional families, and disfunctional personal relationships. The show has two more seasons in the works, so I don't see the story telling changing much. The season premieres and finales tend to be the ones dealing with Superman traits, but even some of these episodes are extremely slow and only deals with a small amount of turning Clark into Superman. So all I have left to say is, where oh where is The Man Of Steel?",2,Where Oh Where Is The Man Of Steel?,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,2636,"['been', 'four', 'years', 'poor', 'teenager', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'person', 'suppose', 'become', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'when', 'are', 'found', 'spaceship', 'cornfield', 'meteor', 'shower', 'are', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'known', 'man', 'Taken', 'farmer', 'wife', 'Ka-El', 'given', 'identity', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'adopted', 'Jonathan', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'life', 'easy', 'going', 'awhile', 'young', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'teenage', 'Clark', 'car', 'taking', 'off', 'bridge', 'Performing', 'daring', 'rescue', 'Clark', 'undoing', 'Lex', 'indebted', 'curious', 'happenings', 'how', 'Clark', 'was', 'able', 'save', 'life', 'then', 'series', 'unwines', 'Strange', 'things', 'occur', 'revolve', 'remaining', 'meteor', 'rocks', 'left', 'Smallville', 'criminal', 'activity', 'arises', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'lives', 'always', 'suck', 'espcially', 'love', 'lives', 'very', 'slowly', 'Clark', 'true', 'destiny', 'arise', 'show', 'so', 'slow', 'so', 'much', 'talking', 'how', 'life', 'viewer', 'soon', 'show', 'not', 'really', 'Superman', 'series', 'boy', 'growing', 'number', 'special', 'powers', 'future', 'not', 'willing', 'accept', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'good', 'will', 'do', 'end', 'two', 'years', 'finally', 'put', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'together', 'are', 'later', 'torn', 'apart', 'Clark', 'disobedience', 'father', 'Jar-El', 'Clark', 'eventually', 'damage', 'loved', 'ones', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'Lex', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'three', 'years', 'Lex', 'Clark', 'finally', 'quit', 'being', 'friends', 'fall', 'conflicts', 'how', 'think', 'world', 'should', 'work', 'show', 'least', 'follow', 'Superman', 'storylines', 'Clark', 'gains', 'x-ray', 'vision', 'heat', 'vision', 'super', 'speed', 'super', 'hearing', 'super', 'strength', 'flying', 'abilities', 'young', 'Louis', 'Lane', 'Perry', 'White', 'stop', 'Smallville', 'so', 'Flash', 'Krypto', 'havic', 'Clark', 'only', 'vulnrable', 'Kryptonite', 'rocks', 'episodes', 'dealing', 'Superman', 'traits', 'are', 'interesting', 'ones', 'are', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'arise', 'how', 'Clark', 'deal', 'then', 'continuous', 'extremely', 'repetitive', 'teenage', 'adult', 'life', 'drama', 'How', 'much', 'school', 'sucks', 'one', ""n't"", 'normal', 'disfunctional', 'families', 'disfunctional', 'personal', 'relationships', 'show', 'two', 'more', 'seasons', 'works', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'story', 'telling', 'changing', 'much', 'season', 'premieres', 'finales', 'tend', 'be', 'ones', 'dealing', 'Superman', 'traits', 'even', 'episodes', 'are', 'extremely', 'slow', 'only', 'deals', 'small', 'amount', 'turning', 'Clark', 'Superman', 'all', 'have', 'left', 'say', 'where', 'oh', 'where', 'Man', 'Steel']",Smallville - The Complete First Four Seasons
914155,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B0009W5IMY,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[0, 1]","The first 3 seasons are more like Buffy with super heroes and as the seasons go on it basically just turns into...Dawson's Creek with super heroes. I mean the show was really good with a smart cast. Michael Rosenbaum is a brilliant Lex Luther and actually likeable. Then in season 5 they just turnt him into someone Clark can't trust 100% but no he doesn't use his money to find out Clark's secret. He uses it to...get Lana. When Clark and Lana finally get together he just becomes the jealous bestfriend. Yes he basically goes from being Lex Luther to...Pacey in Dawson's Creek. Lana was likeable and cute in the first 3 seasons. Then the writers just used her way way too much. Plus they aren't even original. There's like 100's of episodes where she gets knocked out the second Clark enters the room to save the day. Plus actually putting her with Lex where now she's mean to Clark every time she sees him just turns me off. I mean if she they wanted us to worship her as much as they do. The writers shouldn't have made her such an ungrateful.... . I mean half the times she even knew Clark saved her!One of the best things about the show is Allison Mack as Chloe. Who basically transformed from a friend who had a big crush on Clark, to a strong allie. She has cute scenes with Clark and doesn't make wanna yelll ""NO!!"" the second she approaches Clark or vice versa like Lana does to me. Yet just like the likeable Jonathan Kent, when they have to kill someone else off, they'll unwisely not kill Lana and kill Chloe! Yes us Smallville fans see that coming a mile a way. John Glover is just awesome as Lionel Luther and transformed from one of the most evil and untrustworthy guys in the into a guy Clark can trust.That's not that bad though since it's kinda refreshing seeing him working with Clark. The Dawson's Creek part of what they turned him into sucks though. I mean now he's the potential new love interest for Martha Kent as well ""rolls eyes"". Which is proof of how bad the show got after Jonathan Kent died. I mean they turnt the most sneaky guys on the show into simply just guys who will use their money and power to...get women. Now the latest rumor is that Lana might actually be pregnant with Lex's baby. Way to kill the show guys! The Lana and Lex scenes make me itchy already as it is.The first 4 seasons are more like Superboy without Clark actually being Superboy. He saves the day with his powers and battled a new villian of the week. I knocked Clark always fighting metia freaks. But give me metia freaks over the Lana and Lex relationship any day! It was just a good a show. I loved Clark realizing he can shoot lazers out of his eyes and Jonathan Kent tecahing him to control it. I loved Clark getting red kryptonite and being a jerk.The show really needs to have another red k episode. I'd love to see him toss Lex around more and tell off Lana the way she deserves to be told off. I also liked the character Pete who was Clark's bestfriend who found out Clark had powers. He was a cool character but the show only knows how to use Lana and had no clue what to do with him after season 3! Then they introduced the super cute Erica Durance in season 4 as Lois Lane. Some people actually say she is annoying but she's refreshing and I'd rather see the writer's learn how to use her. It's also cool seeing super heroes guest star or super villians. The show uses super heroes way better than it uses super villians though. I mean we got Zod who was awesome in Superman 2. Of course the show just had him go in Lex instead of making it as cool as they could've. The show also had the great James Marsters ""Spike in Buffy"" as Dr. Fine/Brainiac but all his fight scenes with Clark were cut short just to make room for Dawon's Creek drama. That's how the show is basically, short fight scenes and extra drama. It's decent but just not what it used to be or what it could've become.",4,Good show but the first 3 seasons are my favorites,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,3905,"['first', '3', 'seasons', 'are', 'more', 'Buffy', 'super', 'heroes', 'seasons', 'go', 'basically', 'just', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'super', 'heroes', 'mean', 'show', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'smart', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'brilliant', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'actually', 'likeable', 'Then', 'season', '5', 'just', 'turnt', 'someone', 'Clark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', '100', '%', ""n't"", 'use', 'money', 'find', 'out', 'Clark', 'secret', 'get', 'Lana', 'When', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'finally', 'get', 'together', 'just', 'jealous', 'bestfriend', 'basically', 'being', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'Pacey', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Lana', 'was', 'likeable', 'cute', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'Then', 'writers', 'just', 'used', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'original', '100', 'episodes', 'where', 'knocked', 'out', 'second', 'Clark', 'room', 'save', 'day', 'actually', 'putting', 'Lex', 'where', 'now', 'mean', 'Clark', 'time', 'just', 'mean', 'wanted', 'worship', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'writers', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'such', 'ungrateful', 'mean', 'times', 'even', 'knew', 'Clark', 'saved', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'show', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Chloe', 'Who', 'basically', 'transformed', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'big', 'crush', 'Clark', 'strong', 'allie', 'cute', 'scenes', 'Clark', ""n't"", 'make', 'wan', 'yelll', 'NO', 'second', 'Clark', 'vice', 'versa', 'Lana', 'just', 'likeable', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'when', 'have', 'kill', 'someone', 'else', 'off', ""'ll"", 'unwisely', 'not', 'kill', 'Lana', 'kill', 'Chloe', 'Yes', 'Smallville', 'fans', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'way', 'John', 'Glover', 'just', 'awesome', 'Lionel', 'Luther', 'transformed', 'one', 'most', 'evil', 'untrustworthy', 'guys', 'guy', 'Clark', 'can', 'trust.That', 'not', 'bad', 'kinda', 'refreshing', 'seeing', 'working', 'Clark', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'part', 'what', 'turned', 'sucks', 'mean', 'now', 'potential', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'as', 'well', 'rolls', 'eyes', 'Which', 'proof', 'how', 'bad', 'show', 'got', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'died', 'mean', 'turnt', 'most', 'sneaky', 'guys', 'show', 'simply', 'just', 'guys', 'who', 'will', 'use', 'money', 'power', 'get', 'women', 'Now', 'latest', 'rumor', 'Lana', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'pregnant', 'Lex', 'baby', 'Way', 'kill', 'show', 'Lana', 'Lex', 'scenes', 'make', 'itchy', 'already', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'are', 'more', 'Superboy', 'Clark', 'actually', 'being', 'Superboy', 'day', 'powers', 'battled', 'new', 'villian', 'week', 'knocked', 'Clark', 'always', 'fighting', 'metia', 'freaks', 'give', 'metia', 'freaks', 'Lana', 'Lex', 'relationship', 'day', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'show', 'loved', 'Clark', 'realizing', 'can', 'shoot', 'lazers', 'eyes', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'tecahing', 'control', 'loved', 'Clark', 'getting', 'red', 'kryptonite', 'being', 'jerk.The', 'show', 'really', 'have', 'red', 'k', 'episode', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'toss', 'Lex', 'more', 'tell', 'off', 'Lana', 'way', 'be', 'told', 'off', 'also', 'liked', 'character', 'Pete', 'who', 'was', 'Clark', 'bestfriend', 'who', 'found', 'out', 'Clark', 'had', 'powers', 'was', 'cool', 'character', 'show', 'only', 'how', 'use', 'Lana', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'do', 'season', '3', 'Then', 'introduced', 'super', 'cute', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'season', '4', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'people', 'actually', 'say', 'annoying', 'refreshing', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'writer', 'learn', 'how', 'use', 'also', 'cool', 'seeing', 'super', 'heroes', 'guest', 'star', 'super', 'villians', 'show', 'super', 'heroes', 'way', 'better', 'super', 'villians', 'mean', 'got', 'Zod', 'who', 'was', 'awesome', 'Superman', '2', 'course', 'show', 'just', 'had', 'go', 'Lex', 'instead', 'making', 'as', 'cool', 'could', ""'ve"", 'show', 'also', 'had', 'great', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Spike', 'Buffy', 'Dr.', 'Fine/Brainiac', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Clark', 'were', 'cut', 'short', 'just', 'make', 'room', 'Dawon', 'Creek', 'drama', 'how', 'show', 'basically', 'short', 'fight', 'scenes', 'extra', 'drama', 'decent', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'become']",Smallville - The Complete First Four Seasons

The cast are superb in this show. From the first episode I was hooked I wanted to watch more so I bought all four seasons on dvd in one day and I have watched 2 seasons of it so far in just 3 days its so addictive. I now really understand the man behind superman before he was even superman. Each year the show had been maturing and that is what I liked about it. I just can not stop watching the show.

914160,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,B0009W5IMY,The Wickerman,"[45, 46]","Since I'm much too lazy to attempt to review every season individually, I'm going to make a clumsy attempt to review the entire show at once.  I have recently become absolutely obsessed with this show.  For a long time, I just caught a stray episode here and there, and didn't really watch it religiously, but through the generous nature of a good friend, and the magic of DVD's, I was able to get ahold of and watch all of the first three seasons.  After that, the decision to buy this set was easy.""Smallville"" is basically the next incarnation of the Superman mythology, but rather than just being another iteration of the same old thing, it manages to be a fresh and hip new spin on the concept.  It centers on Clark Kent growing up in Smallville, and discovering his super powers and origins, all while trying to lead a normal life as a teenager.  One of the best things about the show is how it brings so many more levels of emotional depth to the character.  This was the beauty of Spiderman, for example, that he was also a kid in addition to having these amazing powers, which made him more relatable and more real to a young audience, and Gough and Millar have successfully brought that same quality to Superman.  He's always been previously depicted as a nearly perfect character, and this is the first time we see him as a human with his own problems and inner conflicts, and I think that makes him that much more of an interesting and sympathetic character.  Plus, it's great to see more of his relationship with his parents, and how they helped to shape him into the man he'll one day be.Also, what they've done with Lex Luthor on this show is just remarkable.  Rather than just having him as the quintessential super-villian, he starts out as a good guy, who befriends Clark, and becomes sort of a big brother/role model character for him.  However, we see from the start that evil runs deep in the family, with his tyrannical, crime-lord father Lionel.  Throughout the show, we see hints that Lex will eventually follow the same path, and that he's always trying to resist becoming his dad, even though we know that somehow he eventually will.  When you put this, and his friendship with Clark into context with what kind of person he eventually becomes, it adds so much more to the concept than just the simple ""Hero vs. Villian"" thing.  Also, Michael Rosenbaum is a remarkably talented young actor, who brings so many more dimensions to the character than ever before.The show begins relatively simple, setting up for everything that will happen later on.  The basic idea that we have to begin with is that the kryptonite from the meteor shower has infected a large number of the townspeople, and given them super powers.  This provides Clark with a wide supply of foes to battle, to sharpen his skills as a superhero.  And once again, we have a human quality here, that we've never seen in any past incarnations of ""Superman"".  The villians are seemingly normal people, usually kids, with no costumes or anything.  It adds a greater sense of realism, and I really like that.Gradually, with each season, the plotlines have gotten more complex, with Clark slowly learning more and more about his abilities, and where he comes from, eventually leading up to the more ""Superman""-like adventures we'll be seeing in season 5.  Each season has been better than the last, and everything is really falling into place nicely.  The pace of the show has been great, and the writers have done a great job of staying true to the mythology, while simultaneously taking it into new and interesting directions.Technically speaking, the show is fantastic as well.  The actors all have great chemistry, and all bring something special to their characters.  Tom Welling is easily the best Superman since Christopher Reeve, so good in fact that I've almost forgotten how bad Dean Cain was.  It's also great to see veteran actors like John Schneider, John Glover, and Annette O'Toole in there with the younger actors, as well as guest appearances from past ""Superman"" stars, like Margot Kidder, Terence Stamp, and even Mr. Reeve himself.  There is also a great deal of subtlety and detail in the show, as far as lighting and camera angles (watch the commentary to get an idea), and the subtle use of color to create just the right atmospheres for the scene.  Also, the special effects are among the best I've seen on a television show.  These guys really put a great deal of time and effort into putting everything together.I really can't say enough about this show.  Everything about it is just so wonderfully engaging, and masterfully executed.  Those who deride it and compare it to ""Dawson's Creek"" just because it's on the WB are being far too superficial, and aren't giving it nearly a fair enough chance.
