Not only does it feature her favorite character, Minnie, but she is her favorite thing, a princess!  At first I though this was an hour long movie featuring Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and friends, then I realized it is actually four episodes.  The first episode of course is Minnie-Rella and then there are three additional episodes.  There is even some Bow-Toons on the DVD from Season 2.  They are episodes that yes have been seen on television but it is nice to have them all on one DVD to watch anytime, anywhere.  The story is adorable, featuring Micky and the gang (like the evil step sisters) asking Minnie to do chore after chore to keep her busy while they get a surprise ready!

My kids, even though they are getting older cannot get enough of Mickey and Minnie and this DVD is chock full of both of them. What I love about this DVD and the series in general is the mix of music and messages of friendship and caring among others that as a parent I want my children to learn.

Actually, Minnie has played a princess before, like in the classic short &#34;Brave Little Tailor.&#34; But this is the context of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, so Minnie and Mickey have to ask the viewer a lot of questions...then pause...the resume the story.There's just no way this DVD can miss with kids who love princesses, especially fans of Sofia the First. It's a half-hour segment from Season Four, which is reportedly the last season of the series. Fortunately, it's uniformly well done, as is the rest of this high-quality preschool series.Each of the episodes has something to do with fairy tales:&#8226; Minnie-Rella (February 14, 2014, Season Four)&#8226; Pluto's Tale (January 20, 2012, Season Three)&#8226; Mickey and the Enchanted Egg (November 20, 2009, Season Two)&#8226; Daisy's Pony Tale (April 15, 2013, Season Four)In addition, there are ten short &#34;interstitial&#34; episodes from season 2 of &#34;Minnie's Bow-Toons.&#34; Also, there is a nice little Castle play set to unfold and put together. They can't do that sort of thing enough.I find &#34;Daisy's Pony Tale&#34; to be the most amusing thanks to the extra comedy provided by the dependable Professor Ludwig Von Drake, voiced by the extraordinary Corey Burton. The voice cast, by the way, is a Hollywood who's-who: Russi Taylor, April Winchell, Will Ryan, Bill Farmer and so many more.As per the series' style, there is a lot of visual gimmickry through wacky contraptions, a fine balance of adventures so each character gets to shine, and of course all that interaction that kids do play along with (I've seen this happen at home and it's adorable).",4,"It had to happen, folks -- Minnie as Cinderella, plus other fairy tale episodes",1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,1713,"['Well', 'course', 'had', 'happen', 'eventually', 'Minnie', 'Mouse', 'doing', 'glass', 'shoe', 'thing', 'Actually', 'Minnie', 'played', 'princess', 'classic', 'short', '34', 'Brave', 'Little', 'Tailor.', '34', 'context', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse', 'so', 'Minnie', 'Mickey', 'have', 'ask', 'viewer', 'lot', 'questions', 'then', 'pause', 'resume', 'story.There', 'just', 'way', 'DVD', 'can', 'miss', 'kids', 'who', 'love', 'princesses', 'especially', 'fans', 'Sofia', 'First', 'half-hour', 'segment', 'Season', 'Four', 'reportedly', 'last', 'season', 'series', 'Fortunately', 'uniformly', 'well', 'done', 'rest', 'high-quality', 'preschool', 'series.Each', 'episodes', 'something', 'do', 'fairy', 'tales', '8226', 'Minnie-Rella', 'February', '14', '2014', 'Season', 'Four', '8226', 'Pluto', 'Tale', 'January', '20', '2012', 'Season', 'Three', '8226', 'Mickey', 'Enchanted', 'Egg', 'November', '20', '2009', 'Season', 'Two', '8226', 'Daisy', 'Pony', 'Tale', 'April', '15', '2013', 'Season', 'Four', 'addition', 'are', 'ten', 'short', '34', 'interstitial', '34', 'episodes', 'season', '2', '34', 'Minnie', 'Bow-Toons.', '34', 'Also', 'nice', 'little', 'Castle', 'play', 'set', 'unfold', 'put', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'sort', 'thing', 'enough.I', 'find', '34', 'Daisy', 'Pony', 'Tale', '34', 'be', 'most', 'amusing', 'thanks', 'extra', 'comedy', 'provided', 'dependable', 'Professor', 'Ludwig', 'Von', 'Drake', 'voiced', 'extraordinary', 'Corey', 'Burton', 'voice', 'cast', 'way', 'Hollywood', ""who's-who"", 'Russi', 'Taylor', 'April', 'Winchell', 'Will', 'Ryan', 'Bill', 'Farmer', 'so', 'many', 'more.As', 'series', 'style', 'lot', 'visual', 'gimmickry', 'wacky', 'contraptions', 'fine', 'balance', 'adventures', 'character', 'shine', 'course', 'interaction', 'kids', 'do', 'play', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'happen', 'home', 'adorable']",Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Minnie-rella

My daughter fell in love with the same movie and when she saw that another favorite character, Minnie Mouse, was in a new movie Minnie-Rella where she becomes Cinderella, she was thrilled to say the least!Minnie Mouse falls asleep and she becomes Cinderella. All of our favorite Disney characters from Micky Mouse Clubhouse play a role as one of the characters from Cinderella and it parallels much of the original movie which Minnie and friends flare.This particular movie came at a great time because my daughter has been having bad dreams and we talk a lot about good dreams. Showing her the magic of daydreams was a great tool for her to understand that everyone dreams and it doesn't have to be bad.This DVD also features Minnie Bow Toons as a bonus which Paige has also always loved.
