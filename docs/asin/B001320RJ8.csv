1140099,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B001320RJ8,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[3, 7]","For a movie that has been released twice on DVD in the past ten years (one of which with 'cult classic film series' plastered across a new slipcover), it seems that 'C.H.U.D.' should have more going for it than what shows up on the screen. This is too bad: I remember quite well seeing the previews for this film when it was first released and, missing out on its theater run, I was really looking forward to watching it all these years later.The specific thing that convinced me to pick it up now was this new release by Anchor Bay - with a dozen or so other films - sporting a new slipcover and a cult fiction stamp on the front that makes it look as though it's been approved by the USDA. I'm all for forgotten and obscure films getting their due, but I have to wonder who is the target audience for this series -- not only is 'C.H.U.D.' included, but so is Werner Herzog's 'Fitzcarraldo'.  Obviously everyone's opinion on what particular film qualifies as a cult classic is going to be different, but I had a difficult time seeing it in 'C.H.U.D.'People are disappearing below the city's streets, and that catch-all 80's bogeyman, toxic waste and what it does to people, is ultimately to blame.  Still being led-on with the idea of cult classic, I was expecting something additional to the B-movie plot, but C.H.U.D. has none of those quirky elements that launch a movie into 'cult' territory.  Viewers coming to this film for the first time are unlikely to see the attraction it may hold for those who remember it from its first release -- I know that I was disappointed.The acting ranges from ok to serviceable to not good, with such notables as future 'Home Alone' alumni Daniel Stern and John Heard, 'Brazil's' Kim Griest, and a brief John Goodman cameo, none of whom turn in the requisite oddball performances I was waiting for.  Nor do the special effects make up for any of the film's deficiencies.  What a difference between the trailers I remember from 25 years ago and the Underground Dwellers that are actually in the movie!  Except for one cringe-worthy moment, the director fails to make the best use of limited budget that he has.Perhaps I'm being too harsh on a movie that shouldn't be judged by any other standard than it's own, but I also think Anchor Bay tried to pull a fast one here.  Underneath this newer, more expensive slipcover edition from 2008 is the exact same package from 2001.  I've checked Anchor Bay's own website and compared DVD information between what's listed for the 2001 release and this one, and I can't find anything different.  Although Amazon lists the 2001 DVD version at 88 minutes, I'm not sure if that isn't a mistake - maybe a carryover from the VHS version, because Anchor Bay lists it at 96 minutes, which is the exact same as what this newer, more expensive version says.  The extras remain the same too; a commentary with John Heard, Daniel Stern, Christopher Curry, Director Douglas Cheek, and Writer Shepherd Abbot; production stills; theatrical trailer; and an Easter egg that shows the shower scene with Kim Griest's nude body double. Transfer information, widescreen info, audio - all the same except the price and the new slipcover. As if they thought slapping 'The Cult Classic Film Series' on the case might influence somebody to buy it...ahem...well, apparently it works, cause I did.Anyway, Caveat Emptor - if you already own this in the last release, and the running time IS 96 minutes, then the only thing new you'll be getting if you buy this version is the slipcover. Instead of a classic, I'd call it a two and a half star effort, rounded up for the commentary, which may be the best thing about the entire movie.  If this is one of your cult favorites and you don't own it yet, check out the 2001 release, which is still available on Amazon at this time for less.",3,Not G.O.O.D.,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,3836,"['movie', 'been', 'released', 'twice', 'DVD', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'one', ""'cult"", 'classic', 'film', 'series', 'plastered', 'new', 'slipcover', 'C.H.U.D', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'going', 'what', 'up', 'screen', 'too', 'bad', 'remember', 'quite', 'well', 'seeing', 'previews', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'missing', 'out', 'theater', 'run', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'years', 'later.The', 'specific', 'thing', 'convinced', 'pick', 'up', 'now', 'was', 'new', 'release', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'dozen', 'so', 'other', 'films', 'sporting', 'new', 'slipcover', 'cult', 'fiction', 'stamp', 'front', 'look', 'been', 'approved', 'USDA', ""'m"", 'forgotten', 'obscure', 'films', 'getting', 'due', 'have', 'wonder', 'who', 'target', 'audience', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'C.H.U.D', 'included', 'so', 'Werner', 'Herzog', ""'Fitzcarraldo"", 'Obviously', 'everyone', 'opinion', 'what', 'particular', 'film', 'qualifies', 'cult', 'classic', 'going', 'be', 'different', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'seeing', 'C.H.U.D', ""'People"", 'are', 'disappearing', 'city', 'streets', 'catch-all', '80', 'bogeyman', 'toxic', 'waste', 'what', 'people', 'ultimately', 'blame', 'Still', 'being', 'led-on', 'idea', 'cult', 'classic', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'additional', 'B-movie', 'plot', 'C.H.U.D', 'none', 'quirky', 'elements', 'launch', 'movie', ""'cult"", 'territory', 'Viewers', 'coming', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'unlikely', 'see', 'attraction', 'may', 'hold', 'who', 'remember', 'first', 'release', 'know', 'was', 'disappointed.The', 'acting', 'ranges', 'ok', 'serviceable', 'not', 'good', 'such', 'notables', 'future', 'Alone', 'alumni', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'John', 'Heard', ""'Brazil"", 'Kim', 'Griest', 'brief', 'John', 'Goodman', 'cameo', 'none', 'whom', 'turn', 'requisite', 'oddball', 'performances', 'was', 'waiting', 'do', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'deficiencies', 'What', 'difference', 'trailers', 'remember', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'Underground', 'Dwellers', 'are', 'actually', 'movie', 'one', 'cringe-worthy', 'moment', 'director', 'make', 'best', 'use', 'limited', 'budget', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'harsh', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'judged', 'other', 'standard', 'own', 'also', 'think', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'tried', 'pull', 'fast', 'one', 'here', 'newer', 'more', 'expensive', 'slipcover', 'edition', '2008', 'exact', 'same', 'package', '2001', ""'ve"", 'checked', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'own', 'website', 'compared', 'DVD', 'information', 'what', 'listed', '2001', 'release', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'different', 'Amazon', '2001', 'DVD', 'version', '88', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'maybe', 'carryover', 'VHS', 'version', 'Anchor', 'Bay', '96', 'minutes', 'exact', 'same', 'what', 'newer', 'more', 'expensive', 'version', 'extras', 'remain', 'same', 'too', 'commentary', 'John', 'Heard', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Christopher', 'Curry', 'Director', 'Douglas', 'Cheek', 'Writer', 'Shepherd', 'Abbot', 'production', 'stills', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Easter', 'egg', 'shower', 'scene', 'Kim', 'Griest', 'nude', 'body', 'double', 'Transfer', 'information', 'widescreen', 'info', 'audio', 'same', 'price', 'new', 'slipcover', 'thought', 'slapping', ""'The"", 'Cult', 'Classic', 'Film', 'Series', 'case', 'might', 'influence', 'somebody', 'buy', 'ahem', 'well', 'apparently', 'cause', 'did.Anyway', 'Caveat', 'Emptor', 'already', 'own', 'last', 'release', 'running', 'time', '96', 'minutes', 'then', 'only', 'thing', 'new', ""'ll"", 'be', 'getting', 'buy', 'version', 'slipcover', 'Instead', 'classic', ""'d"", 'call', 'two', 'half', 'star', 'effort', 'rounded', 'up', 'commentary', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'entire', 'movie', 'one', 'cult', 'favorites', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'yet', 'check', '2001', 'release', 'still', 'available', 'Amazon', 'time', 'less']",N/A

Which Im happy about, but personally it just didnt do it for me. The story was very good, very interesting indeed. Its actually almost mystery-like. But that doesnt make up for the movie's one massive flaw for me, wheres CHUD??? CHUD monsters make 2, maybe 3 appearances throughout the whole movie. And those are SHORT appearances, and I mean really short like 5 seconds each. I really wanted to see some CHUDs killing people but there was only one or two good CHUD scenes in the whole film, it was mostly story. 3/5, good story and one or two good CHUD scenes.",3,"Good story, but wheres the CHUD?",1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,656,"['Good', 'movie', 'got', 'part', 'movie', 'marathon', 'friends', 'loved', 'Which', 'Im', 'happy', 'personally', 'just', 'didnt', 'do', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'interesting', 'indeed', 'actually', 'almost', 'mystery-like', 'doesnt', 'make', 'up', 'movie', 'one', 'massive', 'flaw', 'CHUD', 'CHUD', 'monsters', 'make', '2', 'maybe', '3', 'appearances', 'whole', 'movie', 'are', 'SHORT', 'appearances', 'mean', 'really', 'short', '5', 'seconds', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'CHUDs', 'killing', 'people', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'good', 'CHUD', 'scenes', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'mostly', 'story', '3/5', 'good', 'story', 'one', 'two', 'good', 'CHUD', 'scenes']",N/A
1140102,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B001320RJ8,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[0, 2]","I wanted to like this movie. I remembered having seen this movie. I remembered not liking the movie a lot. I thought if I only watched the movie a second time as an appreciate B movie fan, using my B movie sensibilities. Well, I was tired last night as I watched this movie. It was late, but I've got to say that what stood out the most to me was how poorly the movie flowed and how bad the acting was. It is very obvious when watching this movie that the actors are indeed acting. You can feel many of the lines as they are ineptly uttered by the actors. The plot is fair and I think better acting might have improved this movie a lot. But as it was filmed the acting is quite tedious at times. I never quite get engrossed in the film. The acting isn't very believable. The plot is far from engrossing. The character situations just don't work for the film. First you have the photographer and his girlfriend. Well, the actor/photographer is probably the best in the film. This guy went on to be a teacher in the movie 187 with Samuel Jackson. That actor is great in that movie as a seedy immoral teacher. But in this movie the actor just isn't used very well. I wondered throughout the film who the lead character was supposed to be. Was the lead character the detective who lost his wife, the photographer or the preacher at the soup kitchen. These three characters all had potential to the passion of the film, the character we CARED about, but in the end all three flopped quite badly. Now the detective was at times ok, but mostly he came off as very unbelievable and quite impotent as a detective. The photographer seemingly started out with importance but later just got lost in the fray of weak characters. The preacher at times was a bit strong but mostly he was over the top and stupid.As for the CHUD creatures, they were quite good given what must have been a low budget. As a viewer I wanted to see more of the CHUDS.Another problem with this film is the TONE of the film. Usually I am not as in tuned to a plot, but in this film I just couldn't help from seeing why this movie didn't work well. The film would have worked much better if only it had leaned to the comical side. We get comical scenes what with the cop/government man when he puts a dime or quarter in his mouth at the phone booth. And the g man's sunglasses hammed up the comedy. But mostly this movie came off as harsh and enhanced by a lot of dreadful acting. The detective was just so POOR as a lead character and actor. The detective was a joke. The Preacher was potentially comical but he had the role of making the missing person into a serious issue. The photographer just got lost in the fray. He should have been the lead character but he just got lost in the plot and the subway. He went through the moves as the serious character but there was so little strength to his character via his role and his lines to where one could easily forget that he was the lead character. So we have contrasting inept lead characters vying for dramatic tension that just wasn't there.The best points of the film are when we see the CHUDS in the sewer hanging out and when they attacked the diner. It's great to see character cameos from John Goodman and that other cop in the diner. We'd see much of them later. Also, there was another lead cop who went on to star in many other films. And the Preacher actor also went on to further stardom. I find it difficult to see how this film helped to launch careers though. Personally I was fighting like hell to stay awake. What a PLODDING inept film. Yes, it has MONSTERS and it should have been fun, but it wasn't.Of note, the film was quite good with the over the top GRIMY look of the street people. Someone knew how to apply grime and grease to those characters. I wanted to give all of the street people a bath. I wanted them to WASH their hands. And the wet streets and the lighting worked well. Also, the CHUDS coming out of the sewer worked quite well.Overall though I just didn't enjoy this movie experience. The movie isn't campy or fun. Mostly the movie is harsh, tedious and poorly acted.And also, the girlfriend of the photographer was completely forgettable.",2,Much worse after a second viewing.,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,4190,"['wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'remembered', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'remembered', 'not', 'liking', 'movie', 'lot', 'thought', 'only', 'watched', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'appreciate', 'B', 'movie', 'fan', 'using', 'B', 'movie', 'sensibilities', 'Well', 'was', 'tired', 'last', 'night', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'late', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'what', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'was', 'how', 'poorly', 'movie', 'flowed', 'how', 'bad', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'obvious', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'actors', 'are', 'indeed', 'acting', 'can', 'feel', 'many', 'lines', 'are', 'ineptly', 'uttered', 'actors', 'plot', 'fair', 'think', 'better', 'acting', 'might', 'have', 'improved', 'movie', 'lot', 'was', 'filmed', 'acting', 'quite', 'tedious', 'times', 'never', 'quite', 'get', 'engrossed', 'film', 'acting', ""n't"", 'very', 'believable', 'plot', 'far', 'engrossing', 'character', 'situations', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'First', 'have', 'photographer', 'girlfriend', 'Well', 'actor/photographer', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'guy', 'went', 'be', 'teacher', 'movie', '187', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'actor', 'great', 'movie', 'seedy', 'immoral', 'teacher', 'movie', 'actor', 'just', ""n't"", 'used', 'very', 'well', 'wondered', 'film', 'who', 'lead', 'character', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Was', 'lead', 'character', 'detective', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'photographer', 'preacher', 'soup', 'kitchen', 'three', 'characters', 'had', 'potential', 'passion', 'film', 'character', 'CARED', 'end', 'three', 'flopped', 'quite', 'badly', 'Now', 'detective', 'was', 'times', 'ok', 'mostly', 'came', 'off', 'very', 'unbelievable', 'quite', 'impotent', 'detective', 'photographer', 'seemingly', 'started', 'out', 'importance', 'later', 'just', 'got', 'lost', 'fray', 'weak', 'characters', 'preacher', 'times', 'was', 'bit', 'strong', 'mostly', 'was', 'top', 'stupid.As', 'CHUD', 'creatures', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'given', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'low', 'budget', 'viewer', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'CHUDS.Another', 'problem', 'film', 'TONE', 'film', 'Usually', 'am', 'not', 'tuned', 'plot', 'film', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'seeing', 'why', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'only', 'had', 'leaned', 'comical', 'side', 'get', 'comical', 'scenes', 'what', 'cop/government', 'man', 'when', 'dime', 'quarter', 'mouth', 'phone', 'booth', 'g', 'man', 'sunglasses', 'hammed', 'up', 'comedy', 'mostly', 'movie', 'came', 'off', 'harsh', 'enhanced', 'lot', 'dreadful', 'acting', 'detective', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'POOR', 'lead', 'character', 'actor', 'detective', 'was', 'joke', 'Preacher', 'was', 'potentially', 'comical', 'had', 'role', 'making', 'missing', 'person', 'serious', 'issue', 'photographer', 'just', 'got', 'lost', 'fray', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lead', 'character', 'just', 'got', 'lost', 'plot', 'subway', 'went', 'moves', 'serious', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'little', 'strength', 'character', 'role', 'lines', 'where', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'forget', 'was', 'lead', 'character', 'have', 'contrasting', 'inept', 'lead', 'characters', 'vying', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'there.The', 'best', 'points', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'see', 'CHUDS', 'sewer', 'hanging', 'out', 'when', 'attacked', 'diner', 'great', 'see', 'character', 'cameos', 'John', 'Goodman', 'other', 'cop', 'diner', ""'d"", 'see', 'much', 'later', 'Also', 'was', 'lead', 'cop', 'who', 'went', 'star', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Preacher', 'actor', 'also', 'went', 'further', 'stardom', 'find', 'difficult', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'helped', 'launch', 'careers', 'Personally', 'was', 'fighting', 'hell', 'stay', 'awake', 'What', 'PLODDING', 'inept', 'film', 'Yes', 'MONSTERS', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fun', ""wasn't.Of"", 'note', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'top', 'GRIMY', 'look', 'street', 'people', 'Someone', 'knew', 'how', 'apply', 'grime', 'grease', 'characters', 'wanted', 'give', 'street', 'people', 'bath', 'wanted', 'WASH', 'hands', 'wet', 'streets', 'lighting', 'worked', 'well', 'Also', 'CHUDS', 'coming', 'out', 'sewer', 'worked', 'quite', 'well.Overall', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'experience', 'movie', ""n't"", 'campy', 'fun', 'Mostly', 'movie', 'harsh', 'tedious', 'poorly', 'acted.And', 'also', 'girlfriend', 'photographer', 'was', 'completely', 'forgettable']",N/A
