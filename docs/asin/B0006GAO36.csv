The marketing people nailed this one right on the head.  ""Murder One"" is a wonderful rollercoaster ride, just like ""24.""  And because of that, I give you an Important Warning: DO NOT watch the previews they show during the episode menus.  They give most of the significant plot points away (and for no reason).  Fortunately, I learned this before they spoiled the whopper of a twist in Chapter 16...Now to my review.  This is one of the best seasons of TV I've ever seen.  Though the resolution does seem a little easy and far-fetched, the suspense of how it ends will get you over that quickly.  This show is beautifully acted, beautifully directed, beautifully written and beautifully scored--in my opinion, Mike Post's best work (He won an Emmy for the theme.).  With today's new interest in serialized drama (""24,"" ""Lost""), I think the show would flourish now; but in 1995, it just didn't work and ABC didn't do much to support it.  Thank goodness for the DVD success of ""24,"" or we may never have been able to enjoy this amazing work.  When people look back on the career of Steven Bochco, they'll talk about ""Hill Street Blues,"" ""NYPD Blue,"" and ""LA Law.""  But in my opinion, Bochco's genius begins and ends with ""Murder One.""",5,A True Rollercoaster That Needs an Important Warning...,1110412800,"03 10, 2005",2005,1326,"['sticker', 'packaging', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'minute', ""'Murder"", 'One', 'marketing', 'people', 'nailed', 'one', 'right', 'head', 'Murder', 'One', 'wonderful', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'just', '24', 'give', 'Important', 'Warning', 'DO', 'NOT', 'watch', 'previews', 'show', 'episode', 'menus', 'give', 'most', 'significant', 'plot', 'points', 'away', 'reason', 'Fortunately', 'learned', 'spoiled', 'whopper', 'twist', 'Chapter', '16', 'Now', 'review', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'resolution', 'seem', 'little', 'easy', 'far-fetched', 'suspense', 'how', 'will', 'get', 'over', 'quickly', 'show', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'beautifully', 'written', 'beautifully', 'scored', 'opinion', 'Mike', 'Post', 'best', 'work', 'won', 'Emmy', 'theme.', 'today', 'new', 'interest', 'serialized', 'drama', '24', 'Lost', 'think', 'show', 'would', 'flourish', 'now', '1995', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'ABC', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'support', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'DVD', 'success', '24', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'enjoy', 'amazing', 'work', 'When', 'people', 'look', 'back', 'career', 'Steven', 'Bochco', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'LA', 'Law', 'opinion', 'Bochco', 'genius', 'Murder', 'One']",N/A
867113,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,B0006GAO36,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[1, 1]","I have a theory that we have been in a minor television renaissance for the last ten to twelve years ever since cable stations began producing original scripted shows and the major networks were forced to better the quality of their offerings. If my theory is correct then Murder One stands as a network prelude to that renaissance in scope, concept, acting, writing and production. I didn't watch Murder One when it aired but I was distantly aware of it and when searching for something to watch in the Instant Video offerings, I remembered this and bought the series. I was glad that I had.Murder One follows the progress of one criminal case in exquisite detail over the course of a season. Bad boy movie star Neal Avedon has been accused of murdering his fifteen year old girlfriend via strangulation. His semen is inside the victim, he was on scene within the timeframe of the death, he has had a string of minor legal troubles and problems with drugs, alchohol and blackouts and he has a penchant for strangulation, the method of murder employed. It seems like a slam dunk for the prosecution but defense attorney Ted Hoffman of Hoffman and Associates sees something different and takes the case. The viewer is treated to original characters in the form of the prosecutor, a Machiavellian billionaire who seems to be pulling the strings, the victims sister, a femme fatale who is broken herself, Ted's long-suffering and finally impatient wife, investigators for the police and the defense, junior associates working long hours on the case and trying to further their careers, an unethical psychiatrist who gives damning testimony and many, many other minor characters all painted with a detailed brush. It is the proverbial human drama and not to be missed.All aspects of the production are top notch and the writing is for adults. Sex and drug use are portrayed but never without a moral context. Truly a highlight of legal drama and at 15 years it is as fresh as when it originally aired.

Instead of having a case solved at the end of every epsiode Murder One was about one major trial with all the twists and turns you'd expect with a big case (and many you don't) it was very exciting. I tuned into every epsoide right until the end. The writers were very good at keeping it from getting to dull or boring and the cast was wonderful.,5,I love this show,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,420,"['was', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'seen', 'sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'Instead', 'having', 'case', 'solved', 'end', 'epsiode', 'Murder', 'One', 'was', 'one', 'major', 'trial', 'twists', ""'d"", 'expect', 'big', 'case', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'was', 'very', 'exciting', 'tuned', 'epsoide', 'right', 'end', 'writers', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'keeping', 'getting', 'dull', 'boring', 'cast', 'was', 'wonderful']",N/A
867115,A35QKJ2THM46RK,B0006GAO36,Arthur C. Hurwitz,"[3, 4]","I remember seeing Murder One for the first time by accident in early 1996.  It was about two-thirds of the way through the series and I saw Daniel Benzali playing Ted Hoffman and I said to myself ""Who is this guy and how can this be on TV?""  The Hoffman character was so cool, so reserved, such a perfect lawyer but so unlike any character I had ever seen in a TV program.  In fact he was in style, character and manner similar to a lawyer for whom I had actually worked.  The last third of the show had the most momentum, and I followed to the end.My feeling after seeing the last episode was that it was great and just profound enough.  Ted Hoffman was the man who had come through and saved Neil Avedon from a life in prison not only as a lawyer, but also as a man whose conviction and passion for justice were his ultimate motivators.  I also felt that the last scene in the series, of him being in his office alone was appropo.  Once the trial ended, everyone else went their own way and back to pursuing their own agenda, but Ted Hoffman had no agenda except to be a lawyer and protect the wrongfully accused and framed, i.e. the innocent and the weak, from imprisonment at the hands of the truly corrupt and sinister.Much has been said about the ending.  Was it a bit contrived?  Perhaps, but it nevertheless worked because Richard Cross, who had seemed to be the embodiment of sinister, subtle, behind-the-scenes evil in the series, makes a sort of repentence at the end.  Cross askes Neil Avedon if he could forgive him, he looks the other way.  But Hoffman says that he does because in the end he did the right thing.The very early episodes, Chapters 1-5 were well done, but I do agree with those reviewers who think that it might have lagged a bit in the middle third, but no matter, the acting was always brilliant, the production design was always brilliant and noir, and the cast of characters colorful.  Even when the plot lagged a bit, it was always mezmirizing to watch.  We were mezmirized by Ted Hoffman and we were mezmirized by the show's aesthetic.Murder One's lead character was also a deviation from the standard notions of bravery, heroism, and strength that have always been the stuff of American TV shows and films.  Steve Botchco deserves credit for trying to bring other and new sorts of hero types and models of masculinity into the media discourse.  Versions of these people actually do exist in our country.  They just are never acknowledged or portrayed on TV, up until now.  The American society depicted on the show was complex and diverse, all the characters were from different ethnic and regional and socioeconomic backgrounds, as American life actually is in our country's major urban centers.  All of them had different reasons for being in LA and all of them were thrown together, as life in the United States often truly is.Over time I had managed to see some of the early episodes at the Museum of Radio and Television here in New York.  Up until the DVD set was released, I had never seen the entire series.  I watched all of the episodes in rapid sucession over a few days.  One of the questions I always have is how I would have experienced the series and the story had I been watching it on network television over the course of an entire television season.I know that Ted Hoffman is depicted celebrating Christmas but his personality was that of the classic Eastern European Jewish Man.  When he is shown in the divorce proceedings with his wife, he refuses to play hardball with her because he loves her and wishes only that she be happy, even if that means living withhout him.  He is quiet and in control, but can reason himself out of a tight situation with the right words.  He always maintains the highest of ethnical standards in a tough but controlled manner and always protects himself from the forces around him which threated to drag him into their immoral abyss.So my original contribution to the discussion on Murder One is that it is American television's  tribute to the classic temperment of the Jewish man without being self-conscious about it at all.",5,Ted Hoffman Comes Through,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,4116,"['remember', 'seeing', 'Murder', 'One', 'first', 'time', 'accident', 'early', '1996', 'was', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'series', 'saw', 'Daniel', 'Benzali', 'playing', 'Ted', 'Hoffman', 'said', 'myself', 'Who', 'guy', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'TV', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'cool', 'so', 'reserved', 'such', 'perfect', 'lawyer', 'so', 'character', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'program', 'fact', 'was', 'style', 'character', 'manner', 'similar', 'lawyer', 'whom', 'had', 'actually', 'worked', 'last', 'third', 'show', 'had', 'most', 'momentum', 'followed', 'end.My', 'feeling', 'seeing', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'was', 'great', 'just', 'profound', 'enough', 'Ted', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'come', 'saved', 'Neil', 'Avedon', 'life', 'prison', 'not', 'only', 'lawyer', 'also', 'man', 'conviction', 'passion', 'justice', 'were', 'ultimate', 'motivators', 'also', 'felt', 'last', 'scene', 'series', 'being', 'office', 'alone', 'was', 'appropo', 'trial', 'ended', 'everyone', 'else', 'went', 'own', 'way', 'back', 'pursuing', 'own', 'agenda', 'Ted', 'Hoffman', 'had', 'agenda', 'be', 'lawyer', 'protect', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'framed', 'i.e', 'innocent', 'weak', 'imprisonment', 'hands', 'truly', 'corrupt', 'sinister.Much', 'been', 'said', 'ending', 'Was', 'bit', 'contrived', 'Perhaps', 'nevertheless', 'worked', 'Richard', 'Cross', 'who', 'had', 'seemed', 'be', 'embodiment', 'sinister', 'subtle', 'behind-the-scenes', 'evil', 'series', 'sort', 'repentence', 'end', 'Cross', 'Neil', 'Avedon', 'could', 'forgive', 'other', 'way', 'Hoffman', 'end', 'did', 'right', 'thing.The', 'very', 'early', 'episodes', 'Chapters', '1-5', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'do', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'lagged', 'bit', 'middle', 'third', 'matter', 'acting', 'was', 'always', 'brilliant', 'production', 'design', 'was', 'always', 'brilliant', 'noir', 'cast', 'characters', 'colorful', 'Even', 'when', 'plot', 'lagged', 'bit', 'was', 'always', 'mezmirizing', 'watch', 'were', 'mezmirized', 'Ted', 'Hoffman', 'were', 'mezmirized', 'show', 'aesthetic.Murder', 'One', 'lead', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'deviation', 'standard', 'notions', 'bravery', 'heroism', 'strength', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'stuff', 'American', 'TV', 'shows', 'films', 'Steve', 'Botchco', 'credit', 'trying', 'bring', 'other', 'new', 'sorts', 'hero', 'types', 'models', 'masculinity', 'media', 'discourse', 'Versions', 'people', 'actually', 'do', 'exist', 'country', 'just', 'are', 'never', 'acknowledged', 'portrayed', 'TV', 'up', 'now', 'American', 'society', 'depicted', 'show', 'was', 'complex', 'diverse', 'characters', 'were', 'different', 'ethnic', 'regional', 'socioeconomic', 'backgrounds', 'American', 'life', 'actually', 'country', 'major', 'urban', 'centers', 'had', 'different', 'reasons', 'being', 'LA', 'were', 'thrown', 'together', 'life', 'United', 'States', 'often', 'truly', 'is.Over', 'time', 'had', 'managed', 'see', 'early', 'episodes', 'Museum', 'Radio', 'Television', 'here', 'New', 'York', 'Up', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'released', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'entire', 'series', 'watched', 'episodes', 'rapid', 'sucession', 'few', 'days', 'One', 'questions', 'always', 'have', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'experienced', 'series', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'network', 'television', 'course', 'entire', 'television', 'season.I', 'know', 'Ted', 'Hoffman', 'depicted', 'celebrating', 'Christmas', 'personality', 'was', 'classic', 'Eastern', 'European', 'Jewish', 'Man', 'When', 'shown', 'divorce', 'proceedings', 'wife', 'play', 'hardball', 'only', 'be', 'happy', 'even', 'living', 'quiet', 'control', 'can', 'reason', 'tight', 'situation', 'right', 'words', 'always', 'highest', 'ethnical', 'standards', 'tough', 'controlled', 'manner', 'always', 'forces', 'threated', 'drag', 'immoral', 'abyss.So', 'original', 'contribution', 'discussion', 'Murder', 'One', 'American', 'television', 'tribute', 'classic', 'temperment', 'Jewish', 'man', 'being', 'self-conscious']",N/A

867117,A2LMIDF4HRVSLY,B0006GAO36,Daphne Basset,"[2, 2]","I remember being one of the 10 people who watched ""Murder One"" when it was originally aired on ABC and thinking it was brilliant.  In watching the DVD now, after ten years, it has not only held up beautifully, it is probably more appreciated now.Were it aired today, it would be an absolute HIT!  Unfortunately, ABC kept moving it around the schedule when putting it up against ""ER"" (then in its prime--I am NOT a huge ER fan, by the way) failed,  so that only the most dedicated viewer could find it.The casting is dead on, although in this day and age, Bochco probably would have seen that there was a broader range of ages and races represented amongst the lawyers in the Hoffmann and Associates lawfirm.  It is worthy of note that this show was probably one of the first, if not the first, that has an openly gay character in the form of Hoffmann's office manager.Daniel Benzali is simply wonderful and it is truly a shame that this fine actor, with his understated performance, does not get more work.  Stanley Tucci is nothing short of amazing in his role as billionaire Richard Cross.  Note the physicality of his performance--how he moves around a room and seems to do so little, but you are riveted to his every movement and word,  and yet he makes your skin crawl.  You will find many guest stars in the various episodes show up in other Bochco shows later so it is clear he is loyal to his actors.One thing the viewers should also note is the remarkable sets which were used.  This show really set the standard.  It is largely as a result of this show that other courtroom dramas which followed emulated (I'm thinking especially of all the ""Law and Order"" and ""CSI"" versions)the realistic sets with even the smallest details (note the phone on the judge's bench is actually PLUGGED IN).  This is NOT Perry Mason!If there is any particular weakness to the show, it was Patricia Clarkson's role as Annie Hoffmann, the wife of the lead attorney, Ted Hoffmann.  For the most part, she's given nothing to do but make salad and pour wine and be the supportive wife.  In the latter episodes (and I don't want to spoil the outcome too much) she is disenchanted from her husband's defense of a person who seems to be guilty of a horrific crime.....excuse me, this is what defense attorneys DO!!!!!!!!!!  And this could NOT have been the first case that her husband ever defended someone who 1. was not a sympathetic character and 2. might be guilty of a terrible crime.  This was the only truly false note in the entire show.  Don't get me wrong....I think Patricia Clarkson is a fabulous actress and she gives the part her all...I just don't think the part was well written and thought out.That said, this show will not seem dated to you at all.  In fact, I gave the DVD set to a friend of mine who had never seen the show when it aired on TV.  He thought it was a current show that he simply hadn't seen yet.I know Bochco would probably not consider revisiting the concept he attempted in ""Murder One.""  Perhaps you can't go home again.  But attempted now, this show would be a winner.Pop some popcorn and don't budge in the middle of any episode unless you use the ""pause"" button.  There's a lot going on in this show--great acting, great direction (camera work lightyears ahead of what was being done at the time), truly beautiful set work and dialogue that you only now see in some of the absolute best shows (all mostly Bochco shows too).

867118,ADVX0P3EIKWBK,B0006GAO36,Darth Wader,"[1, 1]","A friend was telling me about a TV show that came out about a decade ago called Murder One and how good it was.  When I saw it on here for $17.99, I thought I would give it a try...and I was immediately hooked!  This isn't necessarily for fans of 24 per se, but it's more of a 24-like format where the whole season is one case (as opposed to watching a TV show where each episode shows a different case and has to be wrapped up by the end of the hour).  This allows for plot twists, great characters, and edge-of-your-seat suspense that makes you wonder WHODUNNIT?  And how and why?  And what makes this so good is the acting.  Daniel Benzani is great at Teddy Hoffman, whether he's in lawyer mode or father mode.  Jason Gedrick is equally amazing as Neil Avedon, the bad-boy actor whose emotions range from snotty, distraught, afraid, high, and suffering from drug withdrawal throughout the series.  His acting gets better with each episode as his character is developed.  There are other great performances with Dylan Baker as the LAPD Detective Artur Polson, Joe Spano as Hoffman's detective Ray Velacek, and all the lawyers in Hoffman's firm.  However, I would give the best performance, hands down, to Stanley Tucci as Richard Cross, who plays this character to perfection!  He was even nominated for an EMMY for this character and it's a shame he did not win.

When it was re-aired on the A&E; channel, I taped it and even though I know ""who done it"", it's still some of the most compelling television created & was definitely way ahead of its time in 1995.It's interesting how during the first few shows, there were ""side stories"" or cases handled while the Avedon case was on the backburner then as the urgency grew and the case progressed, it became the ONLY case that the entire firm was invested in & worked on.I loved Daniel Benzali's multi-faceted performance & wished that he'd won an Emmy.  At times he was the stiff jawed, iron-backed tactician yet when he went home, he became a cuddly teddy bear of a Father to his young daughter.  Other standout performances are Stanley Tucci as the seemingly evil incarnate, Richard Cross; Dylan Baker - always excellent but this time underutilized as the dogged Detective, the actress who portrayed the competitive Justine Appleton (sorry the name escapes me) & John Fleck as Hoffman's Executive Assistant.Out of a strong supporting cast, the only questionable casting choice is Jason Gedrick as the unfortunate, Neil Avedon.  His whiny voice and ""un-movie star aura"" ruined the character for me.  I neither felt sorry for him nor was invested in him as the character in turmoil - I felt more for the law team racing against time to save him than I felt for him.I'd highly recommend this dvd set to fans of the 24 series.**Edited 02/19/09 - I just wanted to clarify my comparison of this show to 24.

I remember seeing some episodes here, another episode there, but i never got into the flow of it. I did remember that I thought it was an interesting concept and I tried to watch it when I could.This was a show that was ahead of its time. It's questionable whether or not it would have survived on TV today, since gripping intelligent television like Boomtown, Scrubs, Arrested Development and similar shows are usually rewarded with low ratings and cancellation; yet after 10 years it still retains much of its appeal. The one-trial for the season was well written, and while they tried an LA-Law style plot-B trial for the first 4 or 5 episodes, the remaining eps focused soley on the Avedon trial or on matters incident to it. The acting on the whole is very good, and Daniel Benzali totally owns the role of Ted Hoffman, an honourable man in a less-than-honourable occupation. Stanley Tucci also did a great job as painting Richard Cross as a dangerous man whose motives always kept the viewers guessing right until the very end. All of the other actors were great in their performances, i have no complaints there.There was a bit of a ""slick"" feel to the entire series however, the use of full names a lot of the time made it seem a bit artificial and some of the mood swings seemed a bit strong and sudden. For example, I never quite picked up when exactly Ted became anti-Richard Cross and pro-Neil Avedon, it was as if the switch occured between episodes rather than on-screen.However, the plot twists will keep you guessing to the very end, and at this price I recommend you check it out.

The main story was gripping, the acting top-notch (with healthy doses of dramatic comedy splashed throughout).Getting there is ALL the fun. Some things to note: as the series began, the writers included subplots that had nothing to do with the main story. I guess it was for those who were more comfortable with shows like LA Law, where all plots were resolved in a single episode. So while the Avedon case took forever to drag on, other cases took a single episode. This approach was abandoned, and starting about halfway through the season, the Avedon case became the sole focus.A bit of trivia I've never seen anyone discussed but that it confirmed on the DVD set: there was an unaired episode. I noticed this immediately at the time, when I didn't recognize any of the scenes during the recap at the beginning of the episode. I've never seen this explained. It's moot now, of course, as the missing episode is included in the box set.My only quibble with the first season of Murder One is the resolution, which I found less than satisfying. It is the only reason I gave this less than five stars. For those who like a good mystery with rich characters and an engaging plot, this series fits the bill.

Played wonderfully by Stanly Tucci, he is a calmly sinester gentleman who is seeking to cover his own ass, while pretending to be everyone's friend.Julie Costello:  The victim's sister, who is Richard's girlfriend, and always has her own agenda.Graham Lester:  The ultra-sleezy psychiatrist, who may or may not be involved in the murder, but who is almost certainly involved in the cover-up.Gary Blanco:  Didn't receive as much attention as the other characters, but he was wonderful comic relief.Miram Grasso:  A wonderful opponent for Ted Hoffman, a sweet, but tough-as-nails assistant DA, who will not hesitate to go for the throat if it helps put Neil Avedon behind bars.If this show had any major flaws it was that the junior members of Hoffman's firm really didn't have much of a personality in the early part of the show, and that the subplot cases they were given seemed to be little more than busywork.  Once they dropped it (after the show's holiday haitus), the secondary firm characters really stepped up, especially Justine, who was clearly torn between two loyalties, between Ted Hoffman & Richard Cross, which was one of the more interesting mini-arcs of the second part of the season.The other thing I wasn't too keen on was the Hoffman family dynamic.  I know what they were trying to do, but I'm not certain it came off as well, although the ending was nice (in that there was no real ending, which was true to life).The extras were sparse, with two commentaries and a 25 minute featurette.  The commentaries were OK at best, but the featurrette was great, as they got most of the major players to come in and comment on that season.All in all, an excellent show that deserved far better treatment than it got from ABC (and how many times have we heard that about a network)?",4,Excellent--ahead of its time,1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,2903,"['probably', 'been', 'said', '24', 'lot', 'first', 'season', 'Murder', 'One', 'shows', 'focus', 'one', 'major', 'story', 'arch', 'bunch', 'twists', 'turns', 'so', 'end', 'quite', 'surprise', 'compared', 'where', 'started', 'shame', 'abandoned', 'one-trial-per-season', 'format', 'S2', 'was', 'probably', 'major', 'reason', 'cancellation', 'departure', 'show', 'center', 'Ted', 'Hoffman', 'can', 'relive', 'suspense', 'only', 'had', 'vague', 'memories', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'watching', 'again', 'realize', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'blew', 'just', 'about', 'other', 'drama', 'water.THe', 'large', 'part', 'was', 'interesting', 'cast', 'characters', 'Ted', 'Hoffman', 'lead', 'defense', 'counsel', 'who', 'shows', 'moral', 'center', 'being', 'amoral', 'job', 'one', 'check', 'conscience', 'door.Neil', 'Avedon', 'THe', 'movie', 'star', 'good', 'looks', 'bad', 'drug', 'habit', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'killed', 'Jessica', 'Costello.RIchard', 'Cross', 'devil', 'incarnate', 'one', 'who', 'up', 'just', 'point', 'trial', 'Played', 'wonderfully', 'Stanly', 'Tucci', 'calmly', 'sinester', 'gentleman', 'who', 'seeking', 'cover', 'own', 'ass', 'pretending', 'be', 'everyone', 'friend.Julie', 'Costello', 'victim', 'sister', 'who', 'Richard', 'girlfriend', 'always', 'own', 'agenda.Graham', 'Lester', 'ultra-sleezy', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'involved', 'murder', 'who', 'almost', 'certainly', 'involved', 'cover-up.Gary', 'Blanco', 'Did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'other', 'characters', 'was', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'relief.Miram', 'Grasso', 'wonderful', 'opponent', 'Ted', 'Hoffman', 'sweet', 'tough-as-nails', 'assistant', 'DA', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'hesitate', 'go', 'throat', 'put', 'Neil', 'Avedon', 'bars.If', 'show', 'had', 'major', 'flaws', 'was', 'junior', 'members', 'Hoffman', 'firm', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'personality', 'early', 'part', 'show', 'subplot', 'cases', 'were', 'given', 'seemed', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'busywork', 'dropped', 'show', 'holiday', 'haitus', 'secondary', 'firm', 'characters', 'really', 'stepped', 'up', 'especially', 'Justine', 'who', 'was', 'clearly', 'torn', 'two', 'loyalties', 'Ted', 'Hoffman', 'Richard', 'Cross', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'mini-arcs', 'second', 'part', 'season.The', 'other', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'keen', 'was', 'Hoffman', 'family', 'dynamic', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'do', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'came', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'ending', 'was', 'nice', 'was', 'real', 'ending', 'was', 'true', 'life', '.The', 'extras', 'were', 'sparse', 'two', 'commentaries', '25', 'minute', 'featurette', 'commentaries', 'were', 'OK', 'best', 'featurrette', 'was', 'great', 'got', 'most', 'major', 'players', 'come', 'comment', 'season.All', 'excellent', 'show', 'deserved', 'far', 'better', 'treatment', 'got', 'ABC', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'heard', 'network']",N/A
867132,A2VEB9Z1W5DD4C,B0006GAO36,M. Newton,"[3, 3]","I had never seen Murder One until I watched this DVD of season one.  I found this to be an outstanding series that must have really been groundbreaking at the time it was released in 1995.  The series has a strong cast and the concept of the entire season devoted to one trial had to be new.  The content is definitely geared for adults, and I would certainly keep the children away.  The crime under trial had a central sex component and the graphic descriptions and language are definitely PG-13 type of material.The star of the series is Danial Benzali, who plays the main defense attorney, Ted Hoffman, in a murder trial of a famous Hollywood actor.  I was impressed with his screen prescence, and the way in which he is entirely beliveable as an outstanding defense attorney to the rich and famous.  He really makes the show.The other members of the cast, both regulars and guest stars, give solid performances.Although the series was excellent, it did have some weaknesses. I was disappointed in the role of Ted Hoffman's wife.  She starts out as an interesting character, giving us some insight into what it would be like to be the spouse of someone involved in a high profile case.  While trying to not give anything away, her personality changes abruptly in the middle of the series and she doesn't even seem to be the same person.  I thought that was handled poorly. Also, toward the end of the season, we begin to see a lot of ""filler"", as the writers had to slow things down to avoid ending the season a few episodes early.Still, the case is very interesting and actually ties up pretty well in the end.  This show avoids the ridiculous endings that afflicts so many films and TV series of this type that try to come up with a bizarre ending that ends up making no sense.I would recommend this DVD collection to all but those who are very sensitive about crime-related material.",5,Outstanding series that stands the test of time,1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,1890,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'Murder', 'One', 'watched', 'DVD', 'season', 'one', 'found', 'be', 'outstanding', 'series', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'groundbreaking', 'time', 'was', 'released', '1995', 'series', 'strong', 'cast', 'concept', 'entire', 'season', 'devoted', 'one', 'trial', 'had', 'be', 'new', 'content', 'definitely', 'geared', 'adults', 'would', 'certainly', 'keep', 'children', 'away', 'crime', 'trial', 'had', 'central', 'sex', 'component', 'graphic', 'descriptions', 'language', 'are', 'definitely', 'PG-13', 'type', 'material.The', 'star', 'series', 'Danial', 'Benzali', 'who', 'main', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Ted', 'Hoffman', 'murder', 'trial', 'famous', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'was', 'impressed', 'screen', 'prescence', 'way', 'entirely', 'beliveable', 'outstanding', 'defense', 'attorney', 'rich', 'famous', 'really', 'show.The', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'regulars', 'guest', 'stars', 'give', 'solid', 'series', 'was', 'excellent', 'did', 'have', 'weaknesses', 'was', 'disappointed', 'role', 'Ted', 'Hoffman', 'wife', 'out', 'interesting', 'character', 'giving', 'insight', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'spouse', 'someone', 'involved', 'high', 'profile', 'case', 'trying', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'personality', 'changes', 'abruptly', 'middle', 'series', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'be', 'same', 'person', 'thought', 'was', 'handled', 'poorly', 'Also', 'end', 'season', 'begin', 'see', 'lot', 'filler', 'writers', 'had', 'slow', 'things', 'down', 'avoid', 'ending', 'season', 'few', 'episodes', 'early.Still', 'case', 'very', 'interesting', 'actually', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'end', 'show', 'ridiculous', 'endings', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'TV', 'series', 'type', 'come', 'up', 'bizarre', 'ending', 'up', 'making', 'sense.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'collection', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'sensitive', 'crime-related', 'material']",N/A
867133,A1MOGEXNCBZE3U,B0006GAO36,"M. Packham ""Stuart""","[2, 3]","Murder One tracks a murder trial from start to finish in twenty-four episodes. There's a minimal number of sub-plots and distractions from the main storyline, and the story is compelling and believable enough to sustain the viewer's attention for a long period of time.The reviewer from Amazon, above, aptly puts it by saying the show rests on Daniel Benzali's shoulders. Benzali plays Ted Hoffman gruff, straight-laced, compassionate and composed. Hoffman holds the show together, and indeed what season two lacked was his presence. As good as Anthony LaPaglia is, he simply does not stack up against Daniel Benzali. Also standing out in this superb drama is Stanley Tucci, who is always brilliant in everything he does. His morally ambiguous Richard Cross connives and slithers his way across the screen, charming all those who come across him. The rest of the cast, especially Barbara Bosson, is particularly good.The writing is spot on and the legalese is accurate. I'm in the legal profession and it's refreshing to see a show that removes some of the 'Hollywood' from the courtroom. After watching Murder One, you'd wonder how a trial-by-jury case could be done in one hour (see Law & Order: Trial By Jury). All of the parts seem so necessary.The only pitfall of the show is the last two episodes, which suffer from the typical Hollywood ending. The show, until that point, was a five and a half star show. Understandably though, this show was made in 96 prior to the hardhitting, uncompromising HBO dramas we're used to now.

As Amazon's review says, it is an excellent production, tense, interesting, quirky, and it keeps you guessing until the very end.

I'd never seen or heard about him before, but he is totally excellent in the role.  The viewer gets to see how a top law firm, with pretty much unlimited resources as provided by a rich client, goes about defending a case.  This came after the O.J. Simpson trial, and was supposedly inspired by that trial, the longest criminal trial in California history.I give this 10 out of 10; if you've never seen it, you're in for a treat.  I watched the entire series, and even though I know how it comes out, it still holds up very well.For some reason, the ratings were low, and they ditched Benzali the second year.

867141,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0006GAO36,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[65, 78]","There's something I don't get about television shows on DVD. I fully understand why they release so many different series. Two of the benchmarks of the evolution of TV shows on DVD occurred when they started to release ""Star Trek' (in its many permutations) and ""The Simpsons"" on DVD. Selling phenomenally well, they created a new revenue stream for these shows. Considering that both play consistently and constantly in syndication, it seems all the more remarkable that someone would pay $35 (and up) for a boxed set of a complete season. But pay it they do. ""The Simpsons - Season 1"" is still one of the top selling DVD sets ever, followed by the other seasons. Fox quickly ramped up production on these DVD sets and started to include more and more extras for subsequent releases. ""The Simpsons - Season 6"" is due to be released on DVD on August 16, 2005. The cancelled series ""Family Guy"" sold so many DVDs Fox decided to bring it back, creating new shows. So, I get the reason they release TV series on DVD. Some of them are a cash cow.What I don't get is why people are willing to buy anything released. I can see the reason behind watching something that was, say, cancelled (""Firefly"", ""The Lone Gunmen""), on cable (""The Sopranos"", ""Deadwood"") or is no longer in syndication. But why would someone buy a DVD box set of ""Survivor""? Once you've seen it, why do you need to see it again? You know who won. Or ""The Mole""? Or ""Too Close For Comfort""? ""The Dukes of Hazard""? And many more. There is a place for classic comedies like ""I Love Lucy"", ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", ""The Simpsons"" or ""Seinfeld"". These are classics and consistently make us laugh. ""Alf""? Come on. Who needs that?A recent DVD release, falling into the ""Cancelled"" category, is Steven Bochco's ""Murder One"".  Premiering on ABC in 1995, Bochco was riding the wave of success created by ""NYPD Blue"" and ""LA Law"". He, along with David Milch (""Deadwood""), created an intense, fascinating, richly detailed show about a high powered law firm in Los Angeles as they defend a movie star for murder. Wait, am I talking about ""LA Law"" or ""Murder One""? There is a key difference between the two.Ted Hoffman (Daniel Benzali) is one of the highest profile attorneys in Los Angeles. Think a Caucasian Johnnie Cochran. The clients who visit his Century City law firm on a regular basis include billionaires, foreign dignitaries, movie stars, entertainment personalities and more. One of his associates, Chris Docknovich (Michael Hayden), whispers in his ear that he heard about a high profile arrest the night before. A young woman was murdered in her Hollywood apartment. Billionaire Richard Cross (Stanley Tucci) was arrested for the crime. Cross is one of Hoffman's clients. Quickly becoming immersed in his client's trial, Hoffman realizes everything is not as it seems and eventually agrees to represent Neil Avedon (Jason Gedrick) when he is eventually arrested for the same crime.The key difference between ""LA Law"" and ""Murder One"" is the concept. ""Murder One"" was created as a vehicle to follow one case over the course of an entire season. An interesting concept, but, unfortunately ahead of it's time. Today, ""24"" (which is also available on DVD), borrows the same sort of idea. But in 1995, it was too much for an audience with MTV-induced attention deficit disorder. Watching the six DVD set of the first season of ""Murder One"", they have included the ""Previously On..."" bits which preceded all of the episodes. This isn't out of the norm, but in this case, they are interesting. It quickly became apparent that the viewers were getting lost in the labyrinth story. The show was `relaunched' a few times by the network. As these efforts became more desperate, the ""Previously On..."" bits became longer and more elaborate, giving new viewers (hopefully), enough information to catch up. It didn't work. Clearly, the only reason the show lasted the two seasons it lasted was because of Bochco's other hits. More on the second season later.""Murder One"" is memorable for many reasons. The show featured some early, and very good, work by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson, both of whom have since gone on to appear in many good films. Tucci, in particular, is very memorable as billionaire Richard Cross. His character is very difficult to figure out. Tucci brings many layers to the role, creating a richly detailed character for television. One minute, he is supportive; the next he is working angles behind the scene to make sure he gets what he wants. Clarkson plays Annie Hoffman, Ted's wife. In the initial episodes, she is supportive and a sounding board for her husband. She would frequently appear at the end of the episode, when her husband returns home. Their exchanges were believable. As the Avedon case progresses, she begins to feel left out of Ted's life and the character develops in a way that I didn't entirely believe. She seems a little too ""New Age-y"" for my liking.Daniel Benzali is a unique personality. In remembering the show, all I could think of was his gruff demeanor. While watching the show again, I was also surprised by the range of emotion. At times, he is a hard ass, at others, an extremely caring man. To some people, he is nice, supportive, caring. To others, he is hell; a perfectionist, manipulative when it suits him, bossy. The character is very, very complicated and multi-faceted. You simply don't find that level on television today. Barbara Bosson, Bochco's ex-wife, appears as Miriam Grasso, the District Attorney who prosecutes the Avedon case. Hoffman and Grasso have worked on opposite sides of many cases before and they have a relationship. They are not beyond caring for each other, helping each other in their personal lives, exchanging friendly words. But when it comes to the case they are currently working on, they are ready to tear one another apart. Bosson's character is equally complex and richly nuanced. Much of the joy of ""Murder One"" comes from watching these two characters face off against one another.The premise of following one case over the course of a television season is unique and interesting. Devoting twenty-three episodes to one story is a lot. Because of this, the case had to be involving, interesting and well-plotted. In ""Murder One"", the case of the People vs. Neil Avedon was all of these things. I don't recall ever watching a legal drama go into the same depth concerning jury selection, or witness preparation, or any of the many other aspects covered for the trial. Because we follow the trial for so many shows, the trial is presented in more depth than we have ever seen on television before.In the beginning of the season, before the Avedon trial gets going full speed, someone decided that the remaining members of Hoffman's team needed to be kept busy. Before the many aspects of working on a high profile trial kick in, we had to meet Arnold Spivak (J. C. MacKenzie), Chris Docknovich (Hayden), Justine Appleton (Mary McCormack) and Lisa Gillespie (Grace Phillips). To do this, each of them, one per episode, is assigned to a secondary case. In television drama terms, this is called a `B Story'. Some of these work, some don't. In one case, two neighbors go to court over a yapping dog. In another, the younger brother of a `gangsta rapper' is convicted of murdering a rival gang member. Both are a little insulting and nowhere near on the par of the rest of the show.As the trial gets going, and we become aware of the level of machinations going on in the background, we realize how well-written, how well-acted, how tightly plotted the show is. We realize how good the show was.It is my understanding that when the show was picked up for a second season, Benzali began making a lot of demands, convinced he was a star. He was let go. Also abandoned, was the idea of following a single case for an entire season. At the beginning of the second season, Anthony LaPaglia joined the cast as the new owner of the law firm. Of course, Stanley Tucci and Jason Gedrick didn't return. In the second season, the idea was that the show would follow three high profile cases, one at a time, in order to allow people to watch more casually. The first case involved a basketball player convicted of murder. It didn't work and the show didn't last its second season. The handful of loyal fans didn't like the change in the show's format and it was cancelled.Thankfully, ""Murder One - Season One"" is now available on DVD and you have the opportunity to watch one of the best television shows ever to grace the small screen.",5,"Almost Perfect - The Little Seen ""Murder One""",1118793600,"06 15, 2005",2005,8580,"['something', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'television',
