569115,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B000056C0P,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[4, 5]","I enjoy a good murder mystery and the Brother Cadfael series is just that.  The Leper of St Giles was one of my favorites of the 20 mysteries by Ellis Peters, because it captures much of the flavor of the period.  Cadfael, the central character of the series, is a Dominican monk and herbalist, and Dereck Jacobi is the perfect personification of him.  He has a presence which suggests strength, wisdom, and compassion.  Unlike most of the other brothers, Cadfael had spent most of his life in the secular world where he participated in the crusades, had adventures, fell in and out of love, and took his order after finding the ways of the world wanting.  He comes from a different culture, that of Wales, and sees that of England through an outsider's more objective eyes.  His experience with life and the motives of men and his keen awareness of detail makes him the perfect sleuth, and when murder is committed the civil authorities, in the person of under sherif Hugh Beringer, are more than willing to have him clear things up for them.  When a young girl is forced by her guardians to wed a wealthy but disagreeable nobleman, the young squires of the latter attempt to help her, only to become mixed in a murder.  One of them is framed for it and arrested, but flees his captors.  Aided by one of his fellow squires, he eludes apprehension only to be accused of a second murder, that of the young girl's guardian.  It looks like curtains for the young man, until Cadfael takes on the case.  Probably the most enjoyable part of the film is the byplay between the nun Alice and Cadfael.  Like the latter, Alice had lived a full life prior to taking her orders and is not naive to the ways of the world.  She appears again in The Rose Rent, and is one of my favorite characters.  The Leper of St Giles is a thoroughly delightful film.",5,Wonderful tale of the 12 Century.,1027555200,"07 25, 2002",2002,1839,"['enjoy', 'good', 'murder', 'mystery', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'series', 'just', 'Leper', 'St', 'Giles', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', '20', 'mysteries', 'Ellis', 'Peters', 'much', 'flavor', 'period', 'Cadfael', 'central', 'character', 'series', 'Dominican', 'monk', 'herbalist', 'Dereck', 'Jacobi', 'perfect', 'personification', 'presence', 'strength', 'wisdom', 'compassion', 'most', 'other', 'brothers', 'Cadfael', 'had', 'spent', 'most', 'life', 'secular', 'world', 'where', 'participated', 'crusades', 'had', 'adventures', 'fell', 'love', 'took', 'order', 'finding', 'ways', 'world', 'wanting', 'different', 'culture', 'Wales', 'England', 'outsider', 'more', 'objective', 'eyes', 'experience', 'life', 'motives', 'men', 'keen', 'awareness', 'detail', 'perfect', 'sleuth', 'when', 'murder', 'committed', 'civil', 'authorities', 'person', 'sherif', 'Hugh', 'Beringer', 'are', 'more', 'willing', 'have', 'clear', 'things', 'up', 'When', 'young', 'girl', 'forced', 'guardians', 'wed', 'wealthy', 'disagreeable', 'nobleman', 'young', 'squires', 'latter', 'attempt', 'help', 'only', 'become', 'mixed', 'murder', 'One', 'framed', 'arrested', 'captors', 'Aided', 'one', 'fellow', 'squires', 'apprehension', 'only', 'be', 'accused', 'second', 'murder', 'young', 'girl', 'guardian', 'curtains', 'young', 'man', 'Cadfael', 'case', 'Probably', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'part', 'film', 'byplay', 'nun', 'Alice', 'Cadfael', 'latter', 'Alice', 'had', 'lived', 'full', 'life', 'prior', 'taking', 'orders', 'not', 'naive', 'ways', 'world', 'again', 'Rose', 'Rent', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Leper', 'St', 'Giles', 'thoroughly', 'delightful', 'film']",Brother Cadfael - Leper of St. Giles

The others are, of course, members of the Abby in which Brother Cadfael resides. He is an herbalist and apothecary, creating healing potions for those in need. This may be one reason he is sufficiently knowledgeable to examine a corpse and make educated guesses about how the person died.Iveta de Massard, young and beautiful, is to be given in marriage by her guardian, Godfrid Piccard, to Huon de Domville, a man at least twice her age and a real pig. We know this because in the opening scene, he and his squires ride past a leper colony. The lepers ask for alms, and he gives them a whipping instead. The squires and the ladies they escort, offer alms.Anyway, Iveta is in love with one of the squires, Joss, but she is an heiress and Piccard has essentially sold her to de Domville. So when de Domville is murdered, Joss is immediately suspected and must flee for his life. And that's as much as you get without my spoiling the story.I'm enjoying this series immensely. I love Derek Jacobi, and the other actors, while mostly pretty young and unknown to me, are talented. The 12th century setting is strongly reminiscent of my days in the Society for Creative Anachronisms, and it's especially fun to observe the costumes, which seem to me to be quite authentic.The leper of the title? Well, there's one who goes by the name of Lazarus, who wears a mask and is therefor anonymous.

569118,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B000056C0P,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[16, 19]","Ellis Peters wrote 20 books about her hero Brother Cadfael. THE LEPER OF ST GILES is an early book in her series, and the DVD film is a faithful account of her story, first broadcast on PBS Mystery series.  Sir Derek Jacobi plays Cadfael, and a host of other fine British actors fill the remaining roles. The Cadfael films were shot in Eastern Europe, and early episodes are the best because Peters served as a technical consultant (she died before the filming was completed).Cadfael's exploits are generally set in the tumultuous years  1130-1150 when the Empress Maud and her cousin Stephen were fighting for the English throne. However, in THE LEPER OF ST GILES, the key to a current mystery lies in the period some 40 years before when Cadfael and other young men took up the cross for Christ as participants in the the First Crusade. In this book/film we learn more about those times and how Cadfael came to his current vocation.St Giles is a way station outside Shrewsbury where the Benedictine monks of the local abby minister to the physical and spiritual needs of the Lepers. In the Middle Ages, people were terrified of Leperosy, a disease that showed up in Europe following the First Crusade to the Holy Land. Because the disease was so contagious and horrible, lepers were not allowed to enter settlements but confined to way stations maintained by the church.  Moreover, lepers were ordered to wear little bells or carry them and ring them when the approached others.One day, an old leper shows up at the Leper Hospital of St Giles. He is tall and at one time was very well built, tho now the ravages of the disease have diminished him. At the same time as his arrival at St Giles, a young girl is escorted to Shrewsbury Abby by her kinfolk for her wedding--to an older man not of her choosing. The young man she would prefer to marry is not well enough situated for her kinsfolk, who want her to join their (her) lands with the bridegroom's lands which lie adjacent to their own.  As was the case in many of these arranged marriages, the bottom line overshadows feelings.The day of the wedding the bridegroom is discovered dead.  He had been out riding in the early moring hours and apparently his horse stumbled and he was thrown and his neck broken--or was he.  Of course, Cadfael discovers evidence of foul play, but who would want the man dead?  Immediate suspicion falls on the young affinanced woman's illicit lover.  Did he do it?  If not, only Cadfael can unravel the mystery and discover many things including the identity of the mysterious leper of St. Giles.",5,Retribution and romance....,976320000,"12 9, 2000",2000,2583,"['Ellis', 'Peters', 'wrote', '20', 'books', 'hero', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'THE', 'LEPER', 'OF', 'ST', 'GILES', 'early', 'book', 'series', 'DVD', 'film', 'faithful', 'account', 'story', 'first', 'broadcast', 'PBS', 'Mystery', 'series', 'Sir', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Cadfael', 'host', 'other', 'fine', 'British', 'actors', 'fill', 'remaining', 'roles', 'Cadfael', 'films', 'were', 'shot', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'best', 'Peters', 'served', 'technical', 'consultant', 'died', 'filming', 'was', 'completed', '.Cadfael', 'exploits', 'are', 'generally', 'set', 'tumultuous', 'years', '1130-1150', 'when', 'Empress', 'Maud', 'cousin', 'Stephen', 'were', 'fighting', 'English', 'throne', 'However', 'THE', 'LEPER', 'OF', 'ST', 'GILES', 'key', 'current', 'mystery', 'period', '40', 'years', 'when', 'Cadfael', 'other', 'young', 'men', 'took', 'up', 'cross', 'Christ', 'participants', 'First', 'Crusade', 'book/film', 'learn', 'more', 'times', 'how', 'Cadfael', 'came', 'current', 'vocation.St', 'Giles', 'way', 'station', 'Shrewsbury', 'where', 'Benedictine', 'monks', 'local', 'abby', 'minister', 'physical', 'spiritual', 'needs', 'Lepers', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'people', 'were', 'terrified', 'Leperosy', 'disease', 'showed', 'up', 'Europe', 'following', 'First', 'Crusade', 'Holy', 'Land', 'disease', 'was', 'so', 'contagious', 'horrible', 'lepers', 'were', 'not', 'allowed', 'enter', 'settlements', 'confined', 'way', 'stations', 'maintained', 'church', 'Moreover', 'lepers', 'were', 'ordered', 'wear', 'little', 'bells', 'carry', 'ring', 'when', 'approached', 'others.One', 'day', 'old', 'leper', 'up', 'Leper', 'Hospital', 'St', 'Giles', 'tall', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'built', 'tho', 'now', 'ravages', 'disease', 'have', 'diminished', 'same', 'time', 'arrival', 'St', 'Giles', 'young', 'girl', 'escorted', 'Shrewsbury', 'Abby', 'kinfolk', 'wedding', 'older', 'man', 'not', 'choosing', 'young', 'man', 'would', 'prefer', 'marry', 'not', 'well', 'enough', 'situated', 'kinsfolk', 'who', 'want', 'join', 'bridegroom', 'lands', 'lie', 'adjacent', 'own', 'was', 'case', 'many', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'bottom', 'line', 'feelings.The', 'day', 'wedding', 'bridegroom', 'discovered', 'dead', 'had', 'been', 'out', 'riding', 'early', 'moring', 'hours', 'apparently', 'horse', 'stumbled', 'was', 'thrown', 'neck', 'broken', 'was', 'course', 'Cadfael', 'evidence', 'foul', 'play', 'who', 'would', 'want', 'man', 'dead', 'Immediate', 'suspicion', 'young', 'affinanced', 'woman', 'illicit', 'lover', 'Did', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'Cadfael', 'can', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'discover', 'many', 'things', 'including', 'identity', 'mysterious', 'leper', 'St.', 'Giles']",Brother Cadfael - Leper of St. Giles
