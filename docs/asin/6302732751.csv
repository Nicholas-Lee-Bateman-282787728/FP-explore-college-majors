Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[0, 1]","This movie hit the screens on October 19 1979 starring Lee Marvin as Col Harry Wargrave, Robert Shaw as General Marenkov and Linda Evans as Elsa Lang. Senior Russian official General Malenkov wants to defect to the Western part of Russia. So the CIA sends one of there top agents, Harry Wargrave to make sure that the General gets to where he wants to go. Malenkov reveals to the CIA that the Russian underground is trying to develop biological weapons and no one is suppose to know about this. Therefore, with Malenkov knowing all this information the CIA decides it would be better for Malenkov to go by train instead of by air across Europe. However, the CIA is after more information then the General can give them so they put the General a train call the Avalanche Express in order to draw the Russian Secret Agents out in order to fine the leader of the group. During the train ride across Europe the CIA has to deal with terrorist attacks and an *********. This movie was as bad as bad can get. I bought this movie because of Linda Evans and I was so disappointed. The only comment I have is don't waste your money on this film because it just wasn't worth it.

330344,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,6302732751,Gary P. Cohen,"[2, 2]","One of my favorite adventure writers of the 1970s was Colin Forbes, and this was one of my favorite Forbes' novels.  The film version has a fine cast but is a highly mediocre affair.The plot concerns a high-level Soviet defector that a group of American agents must get out of Switzerland before the Soviets can kill him. They decide to try to get him out on a railroad train that the Soviets will do anything to derail including creating an avalanche (hence the title of this film.)  The train is portrayed by a highly unconvincing miniature.The Soviet defector is played by Robert Shaw in his last role.  He does not look well and died after shooting was completed.  Most of his dialogue appears (poorly) dubbed.  The lead agent is portrayed by a bored-looking Lee Marvin.  He is assisted by gorgeous Linda Evans, (this film was made right before ""Dynasty."")  Evans is also Marvin's nominal love interest and she appears way too young for him.  Mike Connors is also on hand in a poorly-written role as Marvin's boss (I think.)  Connors had just come off 8 years in the highly successful ""Mannix"" series.  You would think he could have returned to films in a better role than this.  Maximilian Schell is the main Russian baddie, a rather ridiculous character and Horst Bucholz (one of the original ""Magnificent 7"") is also wasted as a good guy who comes aboard near the end of this film.  And finally theres ""Broadway"" Joe Namath as another American agent, wandering around is a large cowboy hat.The many shootouts in this film are totally uninteresting and unexciting.  The music is terrible and constantly swells up to punctuate each serious or action scene.  As stated before, the miniatures of the train being menaced by the avalanche are also totally unconvincing.I really liked most of the actors in this film: Marvin, Shaw, Evans, Connors.  However this is just a totally mediocre action film. The Director, Mark Robson, did much better the previous decade in another action film regarding a train, the great ""Von Ryan's Express"" in 1965.",2,"The Word ""Mediocre"" was Made for this Film",1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,2046,"['One', 'favorite', 'adventure', 'writers', '1970s', 'was', 'Colin', 'Forbes', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'Forbes', 'novels', 'film', 'version', 'fine', 'cast', 'highly', 'mediocre', 'affair.The', 'plot', 'concerns', 'high-level', 'Soviet', 'defector', 'group', 'American', 'agents', 'must', 'get', 'Switzerland', 'Soviets', 'can', 'kill', 'decide', 'try', 'get', 'out', 'railroad', 'train', 'Soviets', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'derail', 'including', 'creating', 'avalanche', 'hence', 'title', 'film', 'train', 'portrayed', 'highly', 'unconvincing', 'miniature.The', 'Soviet', 'defector', 'played', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'last', 'role', 'not', 'look', 'well', 'died', 'shooting', 'was', 'completed', 'Most', 'dialogue', 'poorly', 'dubbed', 'lead', 'agent', 'portrayed', 'bored-looking', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'assisted', 'gorgeous', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'right', 'Dynasty', 'Evans', 'also', 'Marvin', 'nominal', 'love', 'interest', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'Mike', 'Connors', 'also', 'hand', 'poorly-written', 'role', 'Marvin', 'boss', 'think', 'Connors', 'had', 'just', 'come', 'off', '8', 'years', 'highly', 'successful', 'Mannix', 'series', 'would', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'returned', 'films', 'better', 'role', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'main', 'Russian', 'baddie', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'character', 'Horst', 'Bucholz', 'one', 'original', 'Magnificent', '7', 'also', 'wasted', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'aboard', 'end', 'film', 'finally', 'Broadway', 'Joe', 'Namath', 'American', 'agent', 'wandering', 'around', 'large', 'cowboy', 'hat.The', 'many', 'shootouts', 'film', 'are', 'totally', 'uninteresting', 'unexciting', 'music', 'terrible', 'constantly', 'up', 'punctuate', 'serious', 'action', 'scene', 'stated', 'miniatures', 'train', 'being', 'menaced', 'avalanche', 'are', 'also', 'totally', 'unconvincing.I', 'really', 'liked', 'most', 'actors', 'film', 'Marvin', 'Shaw', 'Evans', 'Connors', 'However', 'just', 'totally', 'mediocre', 'action', 'film', 'Director', 'Mark', 'Robson', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'previous', 'decade', 'action', 'film', 'regarding', 'train', 'great', 'Von', 'Ryan', 'Express', '1965']",N/A

330347,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,6302732751,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","'Express' tells the story of Soviet General Marenkov, played by the indomitable Robert Shaw, an extremely high-level intelligence officer who has decided to defect to the west. Obviously the USSR can't allow that to happen, so they're pulling out all the stops, activating every deep cover agent in order to kill him.Smartest thing to do - get him on a jet and fly him to the US homeland. But Marenkov has other plans. He demands that he be taken out by train, basically making himself the target of a continent-wide manhunt.Why not take the smart play? Because Marenkov's biggest secret involves a fellow intel officer, a colonel named B&ugrave;nn. And he knows the western powers will want B&ugrave;nn more than any other person in the world. Why? Because the colonel has been tapped to oversee the newly restarted biowarfare program, a violation of the Biological Weapons Convention and a global threat since the west would be unprepared. Their only chance is to flush B&ugrave;nn out into the open - and Marenkov has volunteered to be the bait.Will the plan work? And will Marenkov survive what is sure to be an all-out effort to have him killed?As I screened this movie, I was not aware that star Robert Shaw was so terribly ill during filming. Honestly, he looks fantastic, so I couldn't help but wonder why the filmmakers lip-synched his entire dialogue. That's when I learned that during production he couldn't speak loud enough for the audio mics. In fact, Shaw was so weak, he would pass away before principal shooting was completed. I was stunned. It's still very difficult for me to accept - he looks so strong and vibrant.That Director Mark Robson also passed away before final editing partially explains the lost opportunities for a more exciting movie. It was certainly within his ability, having executed the much heralded 'Earthquake' just a few years previous. The final nail sealing the fate of 'Express', was the selection of ghost director Monte Hellman, who took over the final aspects filming and editing. Unfortunately, he was known in the industry for doing slow character studies.Again, it's an okay flick with moments of real tension. But the fact that one of the principal lead actors and the principal director passed away before completing the project means that it's missing the focused energy needed to get the job done right.Sad all around. This had the potential for something really good. An example: The avalanche aspect of the film, clearly meant to blend the disaster genre with a spy/thriller, was really well done. And again begs the question, what could have happened had Shaw and Robson lived to see the project through? How good could this have been had not fate intervened?",3,Middling 70's Spy Shuffle,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,2717,"[""'Express"", 'story', 'Soviet', 'General', 'Marenkov', 'played', 'indomitable', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'extremely', 'high-level', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'who', 'decided', 'defect', 'west', 'Obviously', 'USSR', 'ca', ""n't"", 'allow', 'happen', ""'re"", 'pulling', 'out', 'stops', 'activating', 'deep', 'cover', 'agent', 'order', 'kill', 'him.Smartest', 'thing', 'do', 'get', 'jet', 'fly', 'US', 'homeland', 'Marenkov', 'other', 'plans', 'be', 'taken', 'out', 'train', 'basically', 'making', 'target', 'continent-wide', 'manhunt.Why', 'not', 'take', 'smart', 'play', 'Marenkov', 'biggest', 'secret', 'fellow', 'intel', 'officer', 'colonel', 'named', 'B', 'ugrave', 'western', 'powers', 'will', 'want', 'B', 'ugrave', 'nn', 'more', 'other', 'person', 'world', 'Why', 'colonel', 'been', 'tapped', 'oversee', 'newly', 'restarted', 'biowarfare', 'program', 'violation', 'Biological', 'Weapons', 'Convention', 'global', 'threat', 'west', 'would', 'be', 'unprepared', 'only', 'chance', 'flush', 'B', 'ugrave', 'open', 'Marenkov', 'volunteered', 'be', 'bait.Will', 'plan', 'work', 'will', 'Marenkov', 'survive', 'what', 'sure', 'be', 'all-out', 'effort', 'have', 'killed', 'screened', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'star', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'was', 'so', 'terribly', 'ill', 'filming', 'Honestly', 'fantastic', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'lip-synched', 'entire', 'dialogue', 'when', 'learned', 'production', 'could', ""n't"", 'speak', 'loud', 'enough', 'audio', 'mics', 'fact', 'Shaw', 'was', 'so', 'weak', 'would', 'pass', 'away', 'principal', 'shooting', 'was', 'completed', 'was', 'stunned', 'still', 'very', 'difficult', 'accept', 'so', 'strong', 'vibrant.That', 'Director', 'Mark', 'Robson', 'also', 'passed', 'away', 'final', 'editing', 'partially', 'lost', 'opportunities', 'more', 'exciting', 'movie', 'was', 'certainly', 'ability', 'having', 'executed', 'much', 'heralded', ""'Earthquake"", 'just', 'few', 'years', 'previous', 'final', 'nail', 'sealing', 'fate', ""'Express"", 'was', 'selection', 'ghost', 'director', 'Monte', 'Hellman', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'final', 'aspects', 'filming', 'editing', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'known', 'industry', 'doing', 'slow', 'character', 'studies.Again', 'okay', 'flick', 'moments', 'real', 'tension', 'fact', 'one', 'principal', 'lead', 'actors', 'principal', 'director', 'passed', 'away', 'completing', 'project', 'missing', 'focused', 'energy', 'needed', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'right.Sad', 'around', 'had', 'potential', 'something', 'really', 'good', 'example', 'avalanche', 'aspect', 'film', 'clearly', 'meant', 'blend', 'disaster', 'genre', 'spy/thriller', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'again', 'begs', 'question', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'Shaw', 'Robson', 'lived', 'see', 'project', 'How', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'not', 'fate', 'intervened']",N/A
