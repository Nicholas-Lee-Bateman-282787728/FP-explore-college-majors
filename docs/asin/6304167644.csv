No wonder why Jack wanted to get away from her in Five Easy Pieces. Naomi Watts was better in The Ring. Anyone could have done her role in Children of the Corny IV: The Gathering, and it won't make a farthing of a difference. It's a terrible film on so many levels. What was incredible is that it is no different from all the horror films made the last decade yet Children of the Corny IV: The Gathering was rated by the viewers very lowly whilst the others made more in box office and were highly rated. To me, they are in the same league with one same enduring aspect: crap. Basically, people are killed in various ways, there isn't a sensible plot to speak of, deaths are gorier than the one before, and soul and feelings are nil. Boring, if you ask me.

404962,AKZSYXE0L7ETR,6304167644,"Cassandra Ahmad ""Movie Buff""","[0, 0]","I have seen and own all of The Children Of The Corn Series. I can say in general that it went really down hill. The first one was decent, but of course not too much horror. The 2nd and 3rd were completly ridiculous, and made no sense what so ever. Just a big waste.Children Of The Corn 4 The Gathering, I can say was a little bit of a comback compared to the last 2. I think it was worth watching and gave me a little faith again that the series might improve. only problem with this movie was it strayed completly from the power of the corn and ""he who walks behind the rows"". It went into the power of a boy names Josiah. A boy who was abandoned by his mother, and took in by traveling preachers. he later became ""The Amazing Boy Preacher"", that everyone would come and listen to. The preachers became rich because of him, and never wanted it to end. to do that they had to keep him small. So they poisened him with mercury to try to stunt his growth. Unfortunaly their plan didn't work and he grew up anway. Slowly the money ran out, and he again he was abandoned. Later on his soul is unleashed from a well by a drunk. Then he starts his plan to start controling all the children by a fever. He chooses another who was abandoned just like he was to lead the children into their rampage of killing all the adults.I can't say this is the best from The Children of the corn but it was the first descent one after the 1st Children Of The Corn.

404964,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,6304167644,David Girod,"[0, 0]","I have to be honest, I bailed on this series back in the day after catching part of &#34;Urban Harvest&#34; on TV, and would not have re-visited these films if not for a mega-DVD which featured 6 of the &#34;Children of the Corn&#34; sequels for $5. Always ready to enjoy a cheesy film, I simply couldn't pass that up.As the opening credits rolled on &#34;The Gathering&#34; I immediately became interested. Naomi Watts and Karen Black..this film boasted two Academy Award nominated actresses??!?!? Of course we are catching Watts on her way up and Black on her way down..but still, that's pretty impressive casting. They are also backed by some great character actors; Brent Jennings (&#34;Moneyball&#34;) and William Windom (&#34;Murder She Wrote&#34;).A young woman returns home to care for her younger brother and sister when it seems that her mother may be losing her grip on reality. The town of Grand Island, Nebraska seems to be in the grip of something odd, and when an old drunk opens a long abandoned well, something evil is unleashed. Something that is taking over the children of Grand Island.What really made me sit up and take notice was the opening nightmare sequence. The director, Greg Spence, is adding some great camerawork and movement, giving the opening scene quite a bit of atmosphere. As the movie plays out, Spence does a fantastic job of adding little touches here and there, keeping the camera close to the action, giving a sense of isolation to the characters and the camera movement and some nifty slo-mo shots give the whole thing a fever-dream feel. Yes, this is a low budget film, but this director does more with what he is given than most modern horror film makers. There are a few mis-steps, but overall, Spence does a great job of building tension and creating atmosphere.There is a decent amount of gore, but this isn't a splatter film. What makes &#34;Children of the Corn IV&#34; work so well is the creepy vibe woven throughout the film. It helps too, that the focus remains on the adults instead of the kids. While the featured kids do a really good job, Naomi Watts, Brent Jennings and Karen Black do most of the heavy lifting. And while this too is based on Stephen King's short story, &#34;The Gathering&#34; builds it's own mythos, creating a backstory for He Who Walks Behind the Rows, and it's a good one. One of the odd aspects of these films is why normal children would be drawn to a child-preacher in the first place? &#34;The Gathering&#34; does a wonderful job explaining the &#34;why&#34;, &#34;who&#34; and &#34;how&#34;.Best entry in the series so far, highly recommeneded.",5,He Who Walks Behind The Rows Gets a Backstory!!,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,2630,"['have', 'be', 'honest', 'bailed', 'series', 'back', 'day', 'catching', 'part', '34', 'Urban', 'Harvest', '34', 'TV', 'would', 'not', 'have', 're-visited', 'films', 'not', 'mega-DVD', 'featured', '6', '34', 'Children', 'Corn', '34', 'sequels', '5', 'Always', 'ready', 'enjoy', 'cheesy', 'film', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'pass', 'opening', 'credits', 'rolled', '34', 'Gathering', '34', 'immediately', 'became', 'interested', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Karen', 'Black..this', 'film', 'boasted', 'two', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'actresses', 'course', 'are', 'catching', 'Watts', 'way', 'Black', 'way', 'down..but', 'still', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'casting', 'are', 'also', 'backed', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'Brent', 'Jennings', '34', 'Moneyball', '34', 'William', 'Windom', '34', 'Murder', 'Wrote', '34', '.A', 'young', 'woman', 'home', 'care', 'younger', 'brother', 'sister', 'when', 'mother', 'may', 'be', 'losing', 'grip', 'reality', 'town', 'Grand', 'Island', 'Nebraska', 'be', 'grip', 'something', 'odd', 'when', 'old', 'drunk', 'long', 'abandoned', 'well', 'something', 'evil', 'unleashed', 'Something', 'taking', 'over', 'children', 'Grand', 'Island.What', 'really', 'made', 'sit', 'up', 'take', 'notice', 'was', 'opening', 'nightmare', 'sequence', 'director', 'Greg', 'Spence', 'adding', 'great', 'camerawork', 'movement', 'giving', 'opening', 'scene', 'quite', 'bit', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'out', 'Spence', 'fantastic', 'job', 'adding', 'little', 'touches', 'here', 'there', 'keeping', 'camera', 'close', 'action', 'giving', 'sense', 'isolation', 'characters', 'camera', 'movement', 'nifty', 'slo-mo', 'shots', 'give', 'whole', 'thing', 'fever-dream', 'feel', 'Yes', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'director', 'more', 'what', 'given', 'most', 'modern', 'horror', 'film', 'makers', 'are', 'few', 'mis-steps', 'overall', 'Spence', 'great', 'job', 'building', 'tension', 'creating', 'atmosphere.There', 'decent', 'amount', 'gore', ""n't"", 'splatter', 'film', 'What', '34', 'Children', 'Corn', 'IV', '34', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'creepy', 'vibe', 'woven', 'film', 'too', 'focus', 'adults', 'instead', 'kids', 'featured', 'kids', 'do', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Brent', 'Jennings', 'Karen', 'Black', 'do', 'most', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'too', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'short', 'story', '34', 'Gathering', '34', 'own', 'mythos', 'creating', 'backstory', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', 'good', 'one', 'One', 'odd', 'aspects', 'films', 'why', 'normal', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'drawn', 'child-preacher', 'first', 'place', '34', 'Gathering', '34', 'wonderful', 'job', 'explaining', '34', 'why', '34', '34', 'who', '34', '34', 'how', '34', '.Best', 'entry', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'highly', 'recommeneded']",Children of the Corn 4 VHS

With her panache for vituperous  dialogue and two moments of genuine emotional release (when Margaret wakes  up the close-up on Watts is priceless), Watts puts past and present horror  heroines like Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) and Neve Campbell (Scream) to  shame.Even given her solid work (and a bonus point for her good American  accent), this is still not a movie you'd put onto a best-of list.

Karen  Black was her normal self, but the others were good.  The main character,  and the little girl had a real connection, that was evident through out the  movie.

In fact, this one is actually better than 3 in a number of ways, though not enough better for it to actually be, ya know, good, so it's actually less entertaining.  But hell, I didn't mind seeing it, and it was amusing enough for me to continue on with the series.This one isn't directly related to any of the earlier films.  It's more of a knockoff than a sequel, really.  There's no reference to Gaitlin but it is still in Nebraska, in uh, some other town.  Also, there is corn, but it ain't directly related to the action in any way.  Still, ya have got a lotta evil children with Old testament style names, so it's got the same basic flavor.  This one involves Grace, who came back to Nebraska to take care of her crazy, ailing mother.  She's a med student and goes to work in the local doctor's office while she's there.  A strange plague breaks out, affecting various children, but no one else.  They all seem to recover spontaneously, but definitely aren't the same, anymore.  I gotta tell ya, I kinda like this plot.  The execution isn't very good, but it's got a decent base.  I think they coulda made a decent script from this premise, and this isn't as laughable as the kinda ultra-cheap horror usually is.Though this movie has got a fair bit of gore in it, it's actually trying to be more conventionally scary than the prior sequels seemed to be.  It can't pull this off, but it is a bit less silly than some of the earlier stuff.  Still, it has got some decent gore, and they use the scythe a whole lot.  There wasn't nearly enough scythe action in the prior CotC films.This movie gets some extra attention cause it stars Naomi Watts.  Some people will tell you that her performance here is a lot better than you'd usually see in this kinda film, but ehh, I dunno.  It's better, yeah, but not that much better, and still the stuff of B-movies.  Karen Black is a lotta fun as her crazy mother, however.  No one else makes much of an impression.This movie has some pacing problems, as a bit too much of the gore is stuffed towards the beginning, and it fails to really build in anyway.

For roughly three decades the Maine writer churned out book after book, each one selling more and more copies. He's a world unto himself, the lucky fellow! He's so successful that he could throw out his pens, put away his typewriters, bury his word processor six feet under, never write another word in his life, and STILL have enough money to wallpaper the Great Wall of China five times over. In many respects, it's Stephen King's world and the rest of us are just living in it. But, and this is a gigantic but, an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy. We all know the good ones, the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel King's career to even greater heights. ""Carrie"" is probably the best example, followed by ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Dead Zone."" These are wonderful, magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them. Then there are the rest: the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river. Welcome to the Children of the Corn franchise.""Children of the Corn 3"" moved the malevolent corn cult to Chicago. In the fourth installment, the franchise travels back to Nebraska in an attempt to return to its roots. Instead of good old Gatlin, however, the movie unfolds in Grand Island. Grace Rhodes (Naomi Watts) returns home to care for her rapidly deteriorating relative June (Karen Black), a woman who cannot leave the property she owns due to the effects of a fearful dream. In this vision, a young child turns up at her front door to terrorize her. Grace, who has medical experience and plans on one day earning her medical degree, hopes to alleviate June's irrational fears. In the meantime, she goes back to work with Dr. Bob Larson (William Windom) at his medical clinic. In no time at all something sinister starts occurring in town. Kids begin showing up at the clinic with sky-high temperatures and other cardinal signs of a life threatening fever. Instead of perishing, though, the children eventually wake up completely changed. They assume names of children long since dead, exhibit hostility to adults, and generally act weird. When Bob Larson disappears under mysterious circumstances--not so mysterious to the viewer who saw him cut in half--Grace steps in and fills the void. Children continue to sicken and then transform.Rhodes eventually uncovers several clues explaining the odd behavior going on in Grand Island. According to two elderly women, years before a group of traveling preachers brought a young religious prodigy named Josiah (Brandon Kleyla) into town. This kid seemed to work miracles, and the money poured in from far and wide. Then a series of unfortunate incidents led to Josiah's death. It turns out that his ghost is the prime force behind what is happening to Grand Island's children. This spirit is seeking to bring the children together in order to restore Josiah to corporeal form through Margaret Rhodes, who just happens to be Grace's daughter. Confused yet? Throw in side character Donald Atkins (Brent Jennings), a guy whose son went through the transformation and promptly murdered his mother. Rather than take the rap for the crime, Donald went underground until the script told him to meet up with Grace Rhodes. The two head over to some abandoned farmhouse in order to confront the evil that is Josiah. As for June Rhodes-- whose horrific dreams served as the impetus to the entire movie--she can only stand by and watch her vision become a frightening reality, right down to the smallest detail. June and lots of other people expire in particularly heinous manners throughout the film.""Children of the Corn 4: The Gathering"" is an acceptable genre flick thanks largely to the efforts of the inestimable Naomi Watts. She's a big name now thanks to ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""The Ring,"" but back when this movie came out she had to punch the Hollywood time clock just like any other no name actor. She manages to rise above the convoluted script and deliver a solid performance. The same should be said for horror film favorite Karen Black, although her contribution here differs greatly from what Watts offers. Since she plays a woman teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown, the script requires Black to lay the ham on thick. Her physical appearance is hilarious, consisting of an unkempt coif and raccoon makeup. I want to say that it is in ""Children of the Corn 4"" where Black delivers a scream that is so forced and over the top that I hurt myself laughing, but I'm not entirely sure since I've seen so many of her films at this point that they are starting to blend together. The movie also boasts a few impressive gore scenes, especially Larson's disturbing end, which help move the whole thing along.Extras on the disc consist of trailers for parts three, five and six of the ""Children of the Corn"" series, ""Mimic 2,"" ""Dracula 2000,"" ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,"" and ""Halloween: H20."" From here on out, the series falls prey to a serious case of the law of diminishing returns. Part five isn't all that bad, but six and seven will have you holding your nose. ""Children of the Corn 4"" should appeal to Naomi Watts completists and those viewers who must see as many horror films as possible no matter how poor their quality.",3,Back to the

We see a very ill Karen Black having a nightmare about a boy coming into her home with a slash on his hand, and then kills her. But then she wakes up to most horror fans disappointment, and then we come to the opening credits. May I note I liked the end credit opening credit music, it was creppy and kinda cool. Here we see Karen Blacks daughter driving to her house, meeting with her two other siblings, and younger boy & girl, with her doctor, played by William Windom. We soon discover she is becoming addicted to her meds, causing her to have more nightmares.But unknowing to everybody, a boy preacher named Josiah has been resurrected in the town. He kills some random drunk farmer in order to take his barnhouse. A night later, all towns children become possessed under a fever at 105.0. The hospital Naomi Watts & William Windom work at is over-crowded, and a busy night for them burrying the kids in ice and putting them in an ice cold bath-tub, then, everything goes peaceful and subsides, but now there will be a dramatic change in the kids personality.Soon, they all mysteriously creep out into the cornfields, in attempts to fully resurrect the boy preacher Josiah. Later revealed in the film, it says Josiah was burned to death by adults, so you can pretty much see the purpose of the gathering.So Naomi Watts is going to uncover the mystery with this African American guy, whos son has become possessed under the power. So they both learn the secret of Josiah, learning he canonly be defeated with quicksilver. So they fill gun chambers with it, and attempt to kill Josiah, they find all the dead bodies in this barn of the few people killed. Soon, Naomi eventually melts Josiah, breaking the spell, turning all the children normal again.Karen Black was one of the very few killed by the children, so the movie ends with the rest of the family visiting her grave. So pretty much the two kids & Naomi move away, all the children in the town are now living happy again (since they didn't kill the parents in this film).This movie, was actually kinda cool. It tries to be an actual SCARY film, at at some points of the film, it is actually pretty creepy and a few jumps thrown in there. Also really good gore, lots of scythe deaths, along with ceing chopped in half by the waist and dragged on a pitchfork.
