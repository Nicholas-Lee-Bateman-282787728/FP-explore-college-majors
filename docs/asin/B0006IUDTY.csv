It is not a fast-paced movie, and you'll likely find it somewhat predictable, but despite these shortcomings,  it is a very good movie. How? I blame the acting and the directing. This independent film was made without the gloss and polish of a big budget movie, and knowing that, the filmmakers utilized what they did have rather than what was lacking. This film consistently features some of the best non-verbal acting ever brought to the screen , by virtually all of the players. In the commentary they mention repeatedly all the originally scripted dialogue cut from various scenes, replaced by emotionally accurate looks and expressions from the great cast. As they expertly cover a very emotional range of expression and feeling, you never have to wonder what each character is feeling at any given time. This is what good acting  is all about, old-school talent from a young cast who doesn't need special effects or redundant lines---nobody says, ""Gee, I feel sad today."" You know just how they feel; simply look at their face.  Scott Mechiowicz (the Scotty in Scotty doesn't know from Eurotrip) delivers a flawlessly disturbing performance. Trevor Morgan, whom I have previously hailed as one of the greatest non-verbal young actors in the business (see my THE ONES TO WATCH guide here at Amazon) once again easily proves himself. Ryan Kelley, who I first saw as a guest on an episode of Smallville, is an awesome young actor with a brilliantly expressive non-verbal acting skill many of the Hollywood icons would do well to impersonate. I look forward with great anticipation to seeing his remarkable talent in future films. He has also now earned himself a place on my ONES TO WATCH guide. Rory Culkin proves himself here to be (for my money) the best, most talented Culkin yet to emerge in the industry. This kid doesn't need a line, just put him in an acting situation and watch his face. Carley Schroeder also delivers a beautiful, expressive performance. Her eyes are awesome. Look for her in future endeavors, as she is sure to be delighting us for years to come.  Finally, Josh Peck, who plays the bully, delivers a very good performance. His role is by necessity a more verbal role, but he makes it real---he is very hateable a lot of the time and quite likeable when the script calls for it. He makes us believe. They all do.  A quick kudos to the filmmakers here before I end this. Working with a small budget and a non-traditional lack of special effects and fanfare, you did exactly what a good filmmaker should do; you delivered a good film with a great cast, superb acting , believable situations and an overall feeling of realness. You brought out the best in your (extremely talented) young cast, you displayed your vision perfectly and you left the viewer with a sense of wanting more reminiscent of a good book. By the end we like these people, these kids, we're reluctant to leave them and we wish them well.  A film that stays with you after you've watched it is a worthy film.

869571,A18BD98SU49UB7,B0006IUDTY,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[2, 2]","First off, just to reply to some of the reviews I have read:This is FAR from the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. To say that would be a huge overstatement, so I won't. If it is the most disturbing movie you have ever seen, its time to move on to films (in this genre) like Bully, Pups, or The Virgin Suicides. Those are a bit more disturbing, Bully would definitely be near the top for me (for more than one reason, if you've seen it you know what I mean.)Also, comparing it to DELIVERANCE. The only similarity is, there is a boat, water and woods. Otherwise the comparison dies - Sorry.The Review:Mean Creek is a very simple and powerful story about a prank gone bad, and revenge carried a little too far. What's most disturbing is the aftermath. The silent moments. The conclusion. This could be a lesson to all filmmakers that less is more. I mentioned about this above but I am impressed that someone thought this was the most disturbing movie that they had ever seen. The lesson remains: Less is more. Our senses are so bombarded these days that it's nice to see a movie so calm and paced.These kids seem like real kids, and there problems likewise. Many of us have been in similar situations and wished a bully would drop dead, or better yet disappear from the face of the earth. But, if it REALLY happened, how would we respond? Lots of questions.After Mean Creek ended, I felt very somber. The filmmakers wanted this, and it worked. The reality of Mean Creek is that we are grateful to have seen it, but hope we never have to personally experience it.

869573,A1VHK9A4VLJTHC,B0006IUDTY,"Amazon Customer ""Michael S. Beverly""","[2, 3]","While there are some elements of decent drama in this flick, it lacked any real meaning.  I'm reminded of the movie Slingblade, which dealt with family and teen drama in a low budget kind of film style, and that movie had redemption and meaning in it, this one didn't.I'm not sure why some film makers believe that the art is all there is, like the movie The Pledge, which had so much going for it but ended up, in my opinion, being a horrible movie.This could have been a great coming of age flick, the actors were good and much of the dialogue was very believable, it's just that when it was all said and done, I asked myself if I got anything out of watching it, and the answer was no.On the other side of the coin, my seventeen year old daughter watched it a second time when I saw it and she really liked it, plus, it seems, plenty of reviewers have given it rave reviews, so obviously there is a difference of opinion, and I'm not saying it's a horrible movie or anything, I just didn't like it much.As a side note, I read with curiosity the review that bashed the flick for using derogatory terms in it.  Well, news flash, that's how real teenage boys talk, get real, dude.  If anything, that was the best part of the film, the fact that it captured the characters in a convincing way, I was just disappointed that it seemed to me, they didn't grow, or over come a challenge or anything that made me feel good about seeing the story on film.",2,Needed a point,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,1448,"['are', 'elements', 'decent', 'drama', 'flick', 'lacked', 'real', 'meaning', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'movie', 'Slingblade', 'family', 'teen', 'drama', 'low', 'budget', 'kind', 'film', 'style', 'movie', 'had', 'redemption', 'meaning', 'one', ""didn't.I"", ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'film', 'makers', 'believe', 'art', 'movie', 'Pledge', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'ended', 'up', 'opinion', 'being', 'horrible', 'movie.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'coming', 'age', 'flick', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'much', 'dialogue', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'just', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'asked', 'got', 'anything', 'watching', 'answer', 'was', 'no.On', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'when', 'saw', 'really', 'liked', 'plenty', 'reviewers', 'have', 'given', 'rave', 'reviews', 'so', 'obviously', 'difference', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'horrible', 'movie', 'anything', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much.As', 'side', 'note', 'read', 'curiosity', 'review', 'bashed', 'flick', 'using', 'derogatory', 'terms', 'Well', 'news', 'flash', 'how', 'real', 'teenage', 'boys', 'talk', 'get', 'real', 'dude', 'anything', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'fact', 'captured', 'characters', 'convincing', 'way', 'was', 'just', 'disappointed', 'seemed', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'come', 'challenge', 'anything', 'made', 'feel', 'good', 'seeing', 'story', 'film']",N/A
869574,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0006IUDTY,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I think that `Mean Creek' is one of those films that many young kids can relate to.  It is brutal and honest and frightfully realistic, and there are emotions involved that can seem like actual snippets from life experience.  The idea behind this savage film is one that almost everyone has encountered, or at least witnessed, and the films final moments prove to be some of the most provocative and emotionally staggering I've seen put to film.In short, the film revolves around a group of boys who decide to take matters into their own hands when a bully continually picks on one of their little brothers.  Sam is repeatedly terrorized by the oversized George.  Sam's older brother and his friends are familiar with George, for he has made a name for himself as a bully.  The kids decide that, instead of stooping to George's level and physically attacking him they are just going to humiliate him.Nothing ever goes as plan.There are so many aspects of this film I feel compelled to elaborate on, but I know that these reviews really shouldn't be pages long (something I often forget).  I'll try my hand at condensing my personal thoughts, but I'm not promising anything.First, I want to talk a bit about the plot; the script.  This film is simple yet there is a beautiful air of honesty that surrounds it.  The film doesn't feel scripted.  Some have called that out as a fault, but I don't see it that way.  The film feels very lived in, very instantaneous.  The dialog feels natural, in that awkward way young children naturally speak.  What is so important about a film like this (one involving a cast of teens and pre-teens) is that it doesn't feel too mature, despite its mature themes.  `Mean Creek' understands that.  This film captures the crushing circumstances that these young kids find themselves in.  The way things are handled, the way their minds race to conclusions; everything feels so tragically real.This brings me to my next point; the acting.  I want to quote the Indepentant Spirit Award Nominating Committee here.They said, and I quote:""These young actors turned in performances so uniformly unselfish, and so intricately in tune with one another, that it became impossible to single any one of them out from their extraordinary achievement together. Their work is of such high quality that it moves beyond craft to achieve that mysterious truth and beauty that constitutes the finest acting.""I totally agree.  The entire cast received a `Special Distinction Award' for their performances, and I couldn't be happier about that.  All of these young actors really stepped up to the plate and delivered a crushingly realistic portrait of youth at its deepest waters.  These young actors never once stray from their depictions, and they really understand just who and what they are portraying.  They appear like kids, completely in tune with what it means to be a kid.  They embrace their comic sides, their goofy moments of strange behavior and they also embrace the hidden anger that comes from fractured families (they all have their fair share of disgraceful secrets).  When everything comes to a crashing climax and the insufferable guilt begins to peck at their stability they handle things like most any young kid would; irrationally.But then again, isn't that how most adults would handle a situation this bleak?Next, I wanted to just briefly comment on how beautifully constructed this film was.  From the direction (which was complex yet complimentary) to the score (which was haunting) to the lush denseness of the cinematography and the production design; this film really nailed all areas of filmmaking.In the end though, this film really relies on the powerful statement made to make it poignant.  That statement is made in spades.  Each of these characters, no matter how different they feel, are essentially the same person just as separate stages.  They are all angry and alone and scared and they are all searching for something better, something to make them whole.  This harrowing experience helps them to understand that (at least some of them).It's just a shame it had to go this far for them to `understand'.",5,The running waters of understanding...,1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,4152,"['think', 'Mean', 'Creek', 'one', 'films', 'many', 'young', 'kids', 'can', 'relate', 'brutal', 'honest', 'frightfully', 'realistic', 'are', 'emotions', 'involved', 'can', 'seem', 'actual', 'snippets', 'life', 'experience', 'idea', 'savage', 'film', 'one', 'almost', 'everyone', 'encountered', 'least', 'witnessed', 'films', 'final', 'moments', 'prove', 'be', 'most', 'provocative', 'emotionally', 'staggering', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'put', 'film.In', 'short', 'film', 'group', 'boys', 'who', 'decide', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'when', 'bully', 'continually', 'one', 'little', 'brothers', 'Sam', 'repeatedly', 'terrorized', 'oversized', 'George', 'Sam', 'older', 'brother', 'friends', 'are', 'familiar', 'George', 'made', 'name', 'bully', 'kids', 'decide', 'instead', 'stooping', 'George', 'level', 'physically', 'attacking', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'humiliate', 'him.Nothing', 'ever', 'plan.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'aspects', 'film', 'feel', 'compelled', 'elaborate', 'know', 'reviews', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'pages', 'long', 'something', 'often', 'forget', ""'ll"", 'try', 'hand', 'condensing', 'personal', 'thoughts', ""'m"", 'not', 'promising', 'anything.First', 'want', 'talk', 'bit', 'plot', 'script', 'film', 'simple', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'air', 'honesty', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'scripted', 'have', 'called', 'out', 'fault', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'film', 'feels', 'very', 'lived', 'very', 'instantaneous', 'dialog', 'natural', 'awkward', 'way', 'young', 'children', 'naturally', 'speak', 'What', 'so', 'important', 'film', 'one', 'involving', 'cast', 'teens', 'pre-teens', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'mature', 'mature', 'themes', 'Mean', 'Creek', 'understands', 'film', 'crushing', 'circumstances', 'young', 'kids', 'find', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'handled', 'way', 'minds', 'race', 'conclusions', 'everything', 'feels', 'so', 'tragically', 'real.This', 'brings', 'next', 'point', 'acting', 'want', 'quote', 'Indepentant', 'Spirit', 'Award', 'Nominating', 'Committee', 'here.They', 'said', 'quote', 'young', 'actors', 'turned', 'performances', 'so', 'uniformly', 'unselfish', 'so', 'intricately', 'tune', 'one', 'became', 'impossible', 'single', 'one', 'extraordinary', 'achievement', 'together', 'work', 'such', 'high', 'quality', 'craft', 'achieve', 'mysterious', 'truth', 'beauty', 'finest', 'acting', 'totally', 'agree', 'entire', 'cast', 'received', 'Special', 'Distinction', 'Award', 'performances', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'young', 'actors', 'really', 'stepped', 'up', 'plate', 'delivered', 'crushingly', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'youth', 'deepest', 'waters', 'young', 'actors', 'never', 'once', 'stray', 'depictions', 'really', 'understand', 'just', 'who', 'what', 'are', 'portraying', 'appear', 'kids', 'completely', 'tune', 'what', 'be', 'kid', 'embrace', 'comic', 'sides', 'goofy', 'moments', 'strange', 'behavior', 'also', 'embrace', 'hidden', 'anger', 'fractured', 'families', 'have', 'fair', 'share', 'disgraceful', 'secrets', 'When', 'everything', 'crashing', 'climax', 'insufferable', 'guilt', 'peck', 'stability', 'handle', 'things', 'most', 'young', 'kid', 'would', 'irrationally.But', 'then', 'again', ""n't"", 'how', 'most', 'adults', 'would', 'handle', 'situation', 'bleak', 'Next', 'wanted', 'just', 'briefly', 'comment', 'how', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'film', 'was', 'direction', 'was', 'complex', 'yet', 'complimentary', 'score', 'was', 'haunting', 'lush', 'denseness', 'cinematography', 'production', 'design', 'film', 'really', 'nailed', 'areas', 'filmmaking.In', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'powerful', 'statement', 'made', 'make', 'poignant', 'statement', 'made', 'spades', 'characters', 'matter', 'how', 'different', 'feel', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'person', 'just', 'separate', 'stages', 'are', 'angry', 'alone', 'scared', 'are', 'searching', 'something', 'better', 'something', 'make', 'whole', 'harrowing', 'experience', 'understand', 'least', '.It', 'just', 'shame', 'had', 'go', 'far', 'understand']",N/A

Namely Scott Melovicz as the leader of the teen pack and his older brother.  Their acting is the stuff of amatuer videos shot by [...] year old kids.  ""B"" movies present better acting than this...in essence the two of them were unwatchable and they tried to hard to impress us by going way over the top.  It was the kind of acting that makes you squirm in your seat and worse takes you out of the moment of the story.Another huge problem is the realism of the depicted ""trailer white trash"".  Would somebody please tell me what the screen writer was thinking of when he wrote this.  The dialogue is completely unrealistic.  Kids from a lower deprived class do not talk or speak like adults who are college graduates.  They don't construct sentences that are that polished.  And so what does the screenwriter, who I refuse to name, do?  He has the actors pop in profanities once in a while to show off how cool it is to swear in a motion picture.The ending of the film where the kids do the morally right thing and turn themselves in is not believable. The kids portrayed in this film would not have done the morally right thing at the end and it's sickening that the filmmakers decided to go for the easy way out. This cowardly act is the kind of thing art should be avoiding at all costs.  Just tell the truth about the character's intentions and don't go for a plausible and all is nice ending.This film is pure trash made at a level of idiocy, ignorance and a completely delusional state of mind.

You know the guy: he picks on kids smaller than him just because he's a big jerk and he can. Who doesn't want to teach that kid a lesson? So what if you had the chance to do so and you found out he wasn't such a bad guy?In Mean Creek, the bully's name is George (Josh Peck), and the smaller kid he picks on is Sam (Rory Culkin). After a run-in with George, who has been held back a grade several times, making him bigger than the others in his class, Sam, his older brother Rocky (Trevor Morgan), and Rocky's friends Marty (Scott Mechlowicz) and Clyde (Ryan Kelley) come up with a plan: they will invite George to a birthday party for Sam, take him out on a boat on the river, start a game of Truth or Dare, then strip him naked and dump him into the river, and George will have to run home naked. They reason that this is the best way to get back at him, because it doesn't hurt him physically, which would be as bad as what he does to other kids.Also along for the ride is Sam's girlfriend Millie (Carly Schroeder), who wasn't told in advance and doesn't like the plan. George accepts the invitation, but when the group starts to talk to him, they find out that he's not such a bad guy--it seems he just wants some friends--and Sam wants to call off the plan. Everyone agrees except Marty, who's got some personal demons of his own; he's sort of the ringleader for drinking and smoking and things of the same ilk. Things don't go as planned, and each of the characters is faced with a difficult moral dilemma that will affect the rest of their lives.At heart, these are all good kids. Marty has an oppressive older brother, and harbors some sort of resentment against just about everybody--even his friends--but we get the feeling it's because of the way he was brought up, not because of any conscious choice of his own. Clyde has two gay fathers, and is not comfortable when other people insinuate that he too is gay. Rocky wants to be a good role model and protector for his kid brother. Millie is a kind-hearted girl and just wants Sam to like her and have a normal relationship with him. Sam, played especially effectively by the youngest of the Culkin clan, Rory, just wants to be a normal kid and not have to spend his days worrying about whether he will get beat up. And George is the big mystery; we first meet him as a bully, pounding on Sam, but then we see him in his room with his video camera, and he seems lonely. He seems genuinely happy to be hanging out with the rest of this group, but he's got a terrible temper and lashes out without warning.Mean Creek very realistically portrays teenagers doing what they do: fighting amongst themselves and starting more trouble as a group than they ever would as individuals. We get to know each of these six characters very well, and understand why they act the way they do, and the performances here are all flawless. Most of the films about teenagers tend to look down on them and make them all look stupid, but Mean Creek treats them with respect and tries to show why sometimes they act a little strange: because they're confused, and yeah, maybe a little mean.",4,"Teenage noir, realistically portrayed",1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,3190,"['Who', ""n't"", 'wanted', 'get', 'back', 'mean', 'old', 'bully', 'school', 'know', 'guy', 'kids', 'smaller', 'just', 'big', 'jerk', 'can', 'Who', ""n't"", 'want', 'teach', 'lesson', 'So', 'what', 'had', 'chance', 'do', 'so', 'found', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'bad', 'guy', 'Mean', 'Creek', 'bully', 'name', 'George', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'smaller', 'kid', 'Sam', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'run-in', 'George', 'who', 'been', 'held', 'back', 'grade', 'several', 'times', 'making', 'bigger', 'others', 'class', 'Sam', 'older', 'brother', 'Rocky', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'Rocky', 'friends', 'Marty', 'Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'Clyde', 'Ryan', 'Kelley', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'will', 'invite', 'George', 'birthday', 'party', 'Sam', 'take', 'out', 'boat', 'river', 'start', 'game', 'Truth', 'Dare', 'then', 'strip', 'naked', 'dump', 'river', 'George', 'will', 'have', 'run', 'home', 'naked', 'reason', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'back', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'physically', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'what', 'other', 'kids.Also', 'ride', 'Sam', 'girlfriend', 'Millie', 'Carly', 'Schroeder', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'told', 'advance', ""n't"", 'like', 'plan', 'George', 'invitation', 'when', 'group', 'talk', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'guy', 'just', 'friends', 'Sam', 'call', 'off', 'plan', 'Everyone', 'Marty', 'who', 'got', 'personal', 'demons', 'own', 'sort', 'ringleader', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'things', 'same', 'ilk', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'characters', 'faced', 'difficult', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'will', 'affect', 'rest', 'lives.At', 'heart', 'are', 'good', 'kids', 'Marty', 'oppressive', 'older', 'brother', 'harbors', 'sort', 'resentment', 'just', 'everybody', 'even', 'friends', 'get', 'feeling', 'way', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'not', 'conscious', 'choice', 'own', 'Clyde', 'two', 'gay', 'fathers', 'not', 'comfortable', 'when', 'other', 'people', 'insinuate', 'too', 'gay', 'Rocky', 'be', 'good', 'role', 'model', 'protector', 'kid', 'brother', 'Millie', 'kind-hearted', 'girl', 'just', 'Sam', 'like', 'have', 'normal', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'played', 'especially', 'effectively', 'youngest', 'Culkin', 'clan', 'Rory', 'just', 'be', 'normal', 'kid', 'not', 'have', 'spend', 'days', 'worrying', 'will', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'George', 'big', 'mystery', 'first', 'meet', 'bully', 'pounding', 'Sam', 'then', 'see', 'room', 'video', 'camera', 'lonely', 'genuinely', 'happy', 'be', 'hanging', 'rest', 'group', 'got', 'terrible', 'temper', 'out', 'warning.Mean', 'Creek', 'very', 'realistically', 'teenagers', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'fighting', 'amongst', 'starting', 'more', 'trouble', 'group', 'ever', 'would', 'individuals', 'get', 'know', 'six', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'understand', 'why', 'act', 'way', 'do', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'flawless', 'Most', 'films', 'teenagers', 'tend', 'look', 'down', 'make', 'look', 'stupid', 'Mean', 'Creek', 'respect', 'tries', 'show', 'why', 'sometimes', 'act', 'little', 'strange', ""'re"", 'confused', 'yeah', 'maybe', 'little', 'mean']",N/A

Let us just hope that they lead a very cloistered life in which their Mommies and Daddies would not permit them to view ""Schindler's List,"" ""Hotel Rwanda"" . . . or, if we want to remain within the genre, ""The River's Edge."" Under no circumstances was this film ""deeply disturbing."" Much of this ""hype"" stems from the fact that this film's production had to be shelved for years as a result of the Columbine Area School shootings. Producers dropped the project so as not to offend the delicate public . . . even though this film does not involve guns, mass killings, premeditated murder, or even the vaguest semblance to the historical event.When we ignore the hype, what we see is a good film about about the cyclical nature of violence. Martini (nickname ""Marty"") was abused as a child. His older brother also abuses him. The rage inside of Martini spills onto George, a differently-abled ""bully."" What makes this a complex film, is that while George may be the ""bully,"" we see why he lashed-out at those around him. Life isn't easy for this young man. And that is what makes this film interesting: there are no ""good"" or ""bad"" characters . . . only complex ones. Kudos for fantastic writing!The cinematography is lovely. The languorous scenes of swirling eddies are a delight. Still, I will keep my fingers crossed that an actual snail (representative of George) was not stabbed for this film:)It's important to understand that NO ACTUAL CRIME is committed in this film (except perhaps that of negligence and concealing a body, and even that is debatable). That seems to be the point that a lot of these over-emotional ""I-Need-to-Feel-Something"" reviewers seem to be making. They are wrong: legally, there is no crime. If I had to guess, they probably do not have a solid grasp of Indie films and are adhering to principles of Mainstream film . . . embarrassing, indeed.So, again, ignore the hype and enjoy the complexities and beauty of this excellent work.

Thomson,"[1, 1]","Inevitably compared with Rob Reiner's 1986 classic ""Stand By Me"", Jacob Aaron Estes' ""Mean Creek"" stands up well to the comparison.Essentially, it is a simple story of young teenager Sam (Rory Culkin) whose older brother and friends plot revenge on George, a school bully (Josh Peck). Revenge is to take the form of a river trip where George is to be stripped and abandoned to find his own way home . . . but George, at close quarters, turns out to be rather different, if not actually likeable. Things go horribly wrong and the kids are left to deal with far more than bullying.Like ""Stand By Me"", this film has brought together a group of young actors whose performances are seamless. Each character is individual and utterly believable.Estes tells a moral tale without, even for a moment, becoming maudlin or sentimental.

869587,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0006IUDTY,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[4, 5]","The oddest thing about ""Mean Creek"" is that it was the scariest movie that I ever saw, and it's not a horror movie. This is a real-life tale of revenge gone wrong that is shot beautifully, acted very well, and darkly dramatic. This is one of the best films of the year. Almost everything about this movie is disturbing, just in the way that it is shot. I was scared from the very beginning. The opening credits are under the water, and we see the boat that these kids are on roll above, and just the combination of the water, the look of the credits, the music, and the sound of children laughing scared me to this day. I saw this movie in Augest and I still think about it. Although the movie is rated R, I think it should be PG-13, even though it contains many uses of language. But this is the way children act. If you watch a movie like ""Napolean Dynamite,"" the kids don't talk that way. Nobody is an angel, and this movie captures the way that kids act. It's fascinating. I don't recommend this for the faint of heart. It's not graphically violent, but just in the subject matter. It's a shame that this movie did not expand to theatres everywhere, because I think everybody should see it. This is a movie about kids making choices, if they should do the right thing, or get away with things and do the wrong thing. It's a short film, running about 85 minutes, and at this perfect lenght, this genius, and creepy story is told.The movie begins and ends with the sound of a video camera being turned on and off. The bully in this story is George, and he uses his video camera to film himself playing some basketball. But, he then beats up Sam for touching the camera, and Sam's older brother Rocky, and his friends Marty and Clyde decide to teach the kid a lesson. They tell George that Sam's birthday in later in the weekend, and they are going to go on a boating trip. They also invite Sam's friend or girlfriend Millie, and she is wondering why they are bringing George. Especially after asking him earlier if ""you could snap your fingers and he would drop dead right now, would you do it?"" They plan to bring him to the middle of the ocean, and then throw him in the lake, strip him naked, and have him run home, alone. Sam demanded that they hurt him without actually hurting him. Millie doesn't want George to be hurt, especially when they see that he's not such a bad guy, just suffering from problems. He sees words backwards, like instead of seeing STOP, he see POTS.In order to finish my review I'm going to have to fit in some spoilers. If you don't want any plot points to be ruined, stop reading now. I think I gave enough information on why I loved  the movie. Spoilers start now: The plan is off, until George hits Marty in a sensitive stubject, his father killing himself. Marty pushes him into the water, and George drowns, after everybody finds out that he can't swim. They dock onto land, looking for help where they can't find it. This is the moment of truth, as they figure out what to do, and how to do it, with Marty saying to leave him, and others saying to turn themlseves in.As I said earlier, ""Mean Creek"" is a gritty tale about choosing. Doing the right thing, and doing the wrong thing. I loved everything about this movie, and I wish I could see it again so I could really study it. This is the directorial debut of Jacob Aaron Estes, and he is a gifted filmmaker. This movie really disturbed me. I was surprised to see such great preformances by the children actors. Everybody played themselves with such perfection. ""Mean Creek"" plays with your emotions, and with you fear. There's a scene towards the end, when Millie is looking at a bug on a tree, this is when everybody is deciding what to do about George, and she picks up a rock, and slams it into the bug. This is when she finally gives up, and decides to listen to Marty. This is when I realized the gravity of their situation. They could never be forgiven for what they did, and they can't change waht they did. Everybody was in on this together, and with it's brilliant conclusion, I was almost in tears. I watched the credits of the movie, I had to savor everything about this experience.

869588,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006IUDTY,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","MEAN CREEK accomplishes what few films do: it takes a fragment or incident from life and places it as a drop on a slide under the microscope and forces us to examine the details of secret wonder hidden by the clutter of the world at large beyond the focus of that lens.Jacob Aaron Estes is new to the art of filmmaking (his short film 'Summoning' about daughters and mothers and the occult hinted at his gifts) and it is gratifying to come across this quality of talent.  Written and directed by Estes, MEAN CREEK explores a tiny village in Oregon, populated with youngsters form varied backgrounds who face the usual conflicts of the microcosm of schools - hate, dependency, broken homes, drug abuse, fear, and all the other monsters of puberty.  With the clearest of techniques, Estes immediately introduces Sam (Rory Culkin) as he is beaten up by the school bully George (Josh Peck), a lad who is not only obese but dyslexic, sociopathic, and generally loathed by everyone but his obese mother.  Sam is defended by his big brother Rocky (Trevor Morgan) and an older friend Marty (Scott Mechlowicz).  Revenge raises its ugly head and the three boys, together with their close friends Millie (Carly Schroeder) and Clyde (Ryan Kelly) decide George must be made to look foolish.  They carefully plan a phony birthday party for Sam - a trip to the river to go boating and picnicking - and invite George to come along: George will then be coerced in a game of Truth or Dare to strip and the other party members will force him to walk back to town nude in humiliation.As the cinematography and musical atmosphere suggest, the plans go awry and result is a desperate situation that forces each of the participants to cope in his own way, burdened by the baggage with which each comes to the 'tribal dance':  we discover that Marty's father committed suicide, that Clyde is berated because his parents are two gay men, that Millie simply cannot morally comply with the rules of the game, etc.  The manner in which this escapade gallops to the stunning conclusion of this moment in time is thought provoking, terrifying, even understandable and wholly credible.Each member of this superb cast, inexperienced though they may be, fleshes out these characters in a surprisingly sophisticated way.  There is also a fine sense of ensemble acting that can only be the inspiration of the directing skills of Estes.  This may not be an easy film to watch, but this is an important film to see, and in the end is one of the finer movies of the past year.  Highly recommended.

There's always something deeper occasionally sinister beneath the surface of seemingly ordinary kids. Some lash out, some keep it in and let it eat them alive. George is a fat kid with learning difficulties who eats alone in the cafeteria and aggressively bullies every other kid around him, especially Sam (Rory Culkin).When enough is enough Sam gets help from his older brother's pal to set George up for a prank that will teach him a lesson. They go on a mock birthday boating trip with the intention of humiliating him. Trouble is, when George has people being nice to him he's very, very nice and quiet back to them. He has no clue of what their planning. Sam and his brother want to back down but the leader Marty won't leave it alone.George is like the spawn of Satan and the son of God. His unpredictable manner throw the gang into a state of confusion over what to do with him. But he pushes his luck to far and ends up dead. Did he deserve it or not? It's entirely up to you.Mean Creek is a sombre morality play that is as gritty and realistic as anything you'll witness in real life. Director Jacob Aaron Estes draws faultless performances out of his young cast, so much so that even when they are not speaking you can read what they are thinking in their eyes. He atmospherically captures the Pacific-Northwest countryside and pulls you into a engaging story without making it seem overbearing.It's ironic that a realistic teen movie would be rated R instead of PG-13 but if you're a concerned parent worried whether or not this is suitable for younger kids then I would suggest you give it a shot. There's nothing suggestive about it and it might actually help your kids understand bullies rather than hating them.

This film about the bully George (Josh Peck) and the five kids (Rory Culkin, Scott Mechlowicz, Trevor Morgan, Ryan Kelley, and Carly Schroeder) whom accidentally/on purpose do him wrong is lovingly crafted and superbly acted. These kids are not stereotypes; they actually grapple with their conflicting emotions and try to make decisions based on adult values. As most kids, and even most adults, the four cave in (at least temporarily) to the power and the so-called reasoning abilities of the eldest of their group. What is scary in this film is not so much what happens on the river, but the vulnerability of adolescence.Visually this film pulls a lot of feeling and texture from the ordinary features of rural life: massive power line towers; dirty, seaweed clotted river water; worn wooden oars.

Considering the overall age of the actors in this movie, I am surprised how well they pulled it off.  (It wasn't some super sweet teeny-bopper, gum chewing ala ""clueless"" style of movie) Other reviewers likened it to Deliverance (apparently if a movie involves a river, a boat, people and accidental death???)  Though I saw more shades of ""Lord of the Flies"" (I liked the original lord of the flies black and white/british movie better than this) as the absence of parents/parenting seemed a stronger theme in the situation presented.  My largest complaint of this movie is the excessively long scenes of the landscape and the pace of the movie overall.  Too much time was spent in silence with our protoganist staring out a car window, or looking at the sides of the river as we slowly row our way to the ""climax"".  Frankly, I was getting bored waiting for the movie to ""get on with it"".  I was also annoyed at the ending of the movie... no real ""catharsis"" to it.  We are left hanging as to what happened next.  (Mind you, I wasn't looking for the typical Hollywood ending, but that doesn't mean you have to go out of your way to not give me any ending... sheesh.

The film has got a cast of young actors; who excel greatly in the film, the script is pretty solid but seems to be hurried along towards the end. The film opens as we view a fat kid through a video camera playing basketball when another young boy picks up the camera and then ends up getting beat up. The young boy is Sam (Rory Culkin, probably the most talented of the Culkin family) and the fat kid is George (Josh Peck).Turns out nobody likes George, so Sam, his brother Rocky (Trevor Morgan), his girlfriend Millie (the very talented Carly Shroeder), Clyde (Ryan Kelley), and Marty (Scott Mechlowicz, very good in the film) decide to plan a little revenge. Now, if you've seen the previews it's pretty obvious what becomes of George, in case you haven't seen the previews I won't include any more details. But, anyway... The film (in case you were wondering) isn't haunting nor scary nor disturbing. There are some scenes that are a bit sad; like the end when you see George's final video, but for the people who say in their reviews that George is just a troubled kid...I would agree. But when I was watching the film I found it hard to feel any sympathy for the kid (with the exception of a few scenes).

If this had been done, I'm sure this story would not have lost any of its compelling impact, in a Joyce Carol Oates sort of way.The two characters who stood out the most for me in ""Mean Creek"" were George and Millie. Rocky and Sam may have been the primary characters (I'm not sure if I should label them the protagonists, since there doesn't seem to be one in the classic sense), but there is a great deal to discuss about Millie and George.First of all, I have mixed emotions about George. Sure, he's just a kid with what some might consider human qualities, but I just can't help but share in the excitement of seeing what happens when Rocky, his buddies and Sam lure George on the trip. You know what they're going to do isn't right, but if you had ever been targeted by a bully, you can't help but feel that way.While we are on the subject of bullying, you don't get to see a pattern of George's bullying prior to the incident with Sam and George's camera;the viewer doesn't get the benefit of seeing him target any other kids on the schoolyard, nor does the viewer have the opportunity to see a pattern of targeting Sam except for when Sam touches his camcorder. However, it is deemed that George must be dealt with, and the viewer is along for the ride.It is only during the time when the boys pick up George and take him along for the boat outing that we see George for what he is: a dyslexic, lonely kid who has little or no social skills. You almost feel sorry for him as he tries to show empathy towards Millie and her bite, and you roll your eyes when you he brags about smoking a blunt when Marty passes around the grass (deep down, you remember a kid who would brag about doing these things just so he can get accepted). However, George shows his bad qualities when he slings insults at everyone in what he sees as good-natured joshing (again, a sign of poor social skills), and doesn't realize what he is doing. These, and the climax where he hurls insults at everyone on the boat when he finds out about the prank, are the moments where you find yourself hating him.It doesn't seem like a mistake in the casting of Millie. I would not expect anything less than an angelic girl with blonde hair and blue eyes. She is the allegory of the innocence of this group, even when she is forced to French kiss Sam on a dare. Even though she had no idea about the prank while on her date with Sam, she is an unwitting partcipant, and you wonder what is going to happen to her after the kids come forward to George's mother.As I said again, ""Mean Creek"" is an effective film, but it seems the blow would have been stronger had it been written as a novel instead.

869602,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0006IUDTY,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 1]","Bullies have entered the minds of many through news coverage of tragedies such as the Columbine shootings in 1999, maybe even through painful personal experience, or perhaps by being the spectator of someone bullied.  The social implications of bullying are tremendous as they have lead many young people to commit grave and horrible acts of violence in order to prevent teen harassment directed towards them.  Thus, prevention of bullying is a major undertaking that needs to be addressed at every school as some students might become targets for teen discrimination in forms of physical, social, and emotional abuse.  Prevention of bullying must be taught through the enlightenment of the issue and the consequences that bullying might produce, and this information cannot afford to be sugar coated or pleasant, as bullying is an anguishing and tormenting issue that sometimes has deadly consequences.On a sunny school day during a recess for some middle school students when George (Josh Peck) sets up his camera to film himself shot some hoop, Sam (Rory Culkin) discovers the camera standing by itself.  Curiously Sam begins to examine the camera, which quickly turns ugly as George screams to Sam not to touch the camera followed by a severe physical beating while Sam is called several derogatory names.  This is not the first time George has beaten someone, or called someone names.  It appears that this is something of a norm for George, which Sam detests as he wants to teach George a lesson that what he does is not appropriate.Sam's brother and his friends concoct the idea of luring George by inviting him on a boating trip on Sam's birthday, and on the trip they plan on teaching George a lesson by using his own methods.  The trap is set up to perfection, but when they get to meet George they discover a sad character.  The group's plan change as they decide not to go through with the plan in sympathy for George.  The journey down the creek by the small party of teens becomes a tormenting experience as the story moves in waves.  Where each wave brings a new and unexpected emotion as it discloses more about George's persona.  Feelings of sympathy, anger, and disgust bounce off the audience's mind with calculated precision as Jacob Aaron Estes lets the story run its course while its looming direction seems unavoidable.Mean Creek follows the footsteps of several other films that aim their attention towards this deplorable teen behavior.  Bully (2001) by Larry Clark is a much darker and nastier story in regards to bullying where the teens take the law into their own hands.  Gus van Sant directed Elephant (2003) that won the Golden Palm in Cannes 2003, which depicts the calm before the storm in a similar manner as what happened in Columbine in 1999.  Estes brings the audience a different perspective than van Sant and Clark did in their films as he brings the two different parties together on an enlightening journey where they discover the awful truth about bullying and violence.Mean Creek provides the opportunity for enlightenment in regards to bullying in a genuine and unpleasant manner and should be considered to be seen by most teens.  However, MPAA has given the film a R-rating, which limits the number of teens that will be able to see the film.  This is unfortunate as Estes seems to have given a sincere version of how bullying can be detrimental in more than one way as it can affect -- the bully, the bullied, and the spectator.",4,"Teens and Bullying in a Good, Yet Unpleasant Film...",1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,3475,"['Bullies', 'have', 'entered', 'minds', 'many', 'news', 'coverage', 'tragedies', 'such', 'Columbine', 'shootings', '1999', 'maybe', 'even', 'painful', 'personal', 'experience', 'perhaps', 'being', 'spectator', 'someone', 'bullied', 'social', 'implications', 'bullying', 'are', 'tremendous', 'have', 'lead', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'commit', 'grave', 'horrible', 'acts', 'violence', 'order', 'prevent', 'teen', 'harassment', 'directed', 'towards', 'Thus', 'prevention', 'bullying', 'major', 'undertaking', 'be', 'addressed', 'school', 'students', 'might', 'become', 'targets', 'teen', 'discrimination', 'forms', 'physical', 'social', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'Prevention', 'bullying', 'must', 'be', 'taught', 'enlightenment', 'issue', 'consequences', 'bullying', 'might', 'produce', 'information', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'be', 'sugar', 'coated', 'pleasant', 'bullying', 'anguishing', 'tormenting', 'issue', 'sometimes', 'deadly', 'consequences.On', 'sunny', 'school', 'day', 'recess', 'middle', 'school', 'students', 'when', 'George', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'up', 'camera', 'film', 'shot', 'hoop', 'Sam', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'camera', 'standing', 'Curiously', 'Sam', 'examine', 'camera', 'quickly', 'ugly', 'George', 'Sam', 'not', 'touch', 'camera', 'followed', 'severe', 'physical', 'beating', 'Sam', 'called', 'several', 'derogatory', 'names', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'George', 'beaten', 'someone', 'called', 'someone', 'names', 'something', 'norm', 'George', 'Sam', 'teach', 'George', 'lesson', 'what', 'not', 'appropriate.Sam', 'brother', 'friends', 'concoct', 'idea', 'luring', 'George', 'inviting', 'boating', 'trip', 'Sam', 'birthday', 'trip', 'plan', 'teaching', 'George', 'lesson', 'using', 'own', 'methods', 'trap', 'set', 'up', 'perfection', 'when', 'get', 'meet', 'George', 'discover', 'sad', 'character', 'group', 'plan', 'change', 'decide', 'not', 'go', 'plan', 'sympathy', 'George', 'journey', 'down', 'creek', 'small', 'party', 'teens', 'tormenting', 'experience', 'story', 'moves', 'waves', 'Where', 'wave', 'new', 'unexpected', 'emotion', 'more', 'George', 'persona', 'Feelings', 'sympathy', 'anger', 'disgust', 'bounce', 'audience', 'mind', 'calculated', 'precision', 'Jacob', 'Aaron', 'Estes', 'story', 'run', 'course', 'looming', 'direction', 'unavoidable.Mean', 'Creek', 'footsteps', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'aim', 'attention', 'deplorable', 'teen', 'behavior', 'Bully', '2001', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'much', 'darker', 'nastier', 'story', 'regards', 'bullying', 'where', 'teens', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'Gus', 'van', 'Sant', 'directed', 'Elephant', '2003', 'won', 'Golden', 'Palm', 'Cannes', '2003', 'calm', 'storm', 'similar', 'manner', 'what', 'happened', 'Columbine', '1999', 'Estes', 'audience', 'different', 'perspective', 'van', 'Sant', 'Clark', 'did', 'films', 'two', 'different', 'parties', 'together', 'enlightening', 'journey', 'where', 'discover', 'awful', 'truth', 'bullying', 'violence.Mean', 'Creek', 'opportunity', 'enlightenment', 'regards', 'bullying', 'genuine', 'unpleasant', 'manner', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'seen', 'most', 'teens', 'However', 'MPAA', 'given', 'film', 'R-rating', 'number', 'teens', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'film', 'unfortunate', 'Estes', 'have', 'given', 'sincere', 'version', 'how', 'bullying', 'can', 'be', 'detrimental', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'can', 'affect', 'bully', 'bullied', 'spectator']",N/A

The acting is very good by an ensemble cast of people 16 and under, and nothing that happens really seems out of place or decidedly unusual.

869605,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B0006IUDTY,M. Burns,"[69, 93]","I'm sitting here, nearly two hours after the credits of Mean Creek have finished rolling, I still feel that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach that won't go away. I can remember sitting there, speechless, as the credits rolled; how I felt light-headed after I left the theater; how I started shaking and my knees started knocking. I can remember clearly that this 89-minute descent into moral hell is the single most disturbing film I've ever seen. And I'm still piecing together how to put any of it into words.I'll start a couple of years ago, when I read Truman Capote's In Cold Blood and have since never gotten over the idea that it still is very plausible that two men can walk into a home, murder four people in cold blood, and do all of it for virtually nothing. The book scared the crap out of me because of the fact that it happened, things similar to it still happen, and they happen to people just like you and I. I get the chills when thoughts of demons or ghosts or aliens arise, just like everyone else, but what makes me keep the light on at night is the fact that I'm one of millions of people on this earth who are capable of doing anything. And by 'anything,' I don't mean mowing the lawn.Mean Creek is obstensibly about that dark possibility that lurks within everyone, that one moment when reason is thrown away, the stars are aligned, and disaster strikes. It's really about the aftermath, though; and not just the logistics, but the strange things that we as humans do when we're in a situation that we never imagined we would have to encounter in a million years. And it all begins because Sam (Rory Culkin, officially the best actor in his famous family) is pissed. Pissed because the fat kid, George, beat the crap out of him for basically no reason.Nobody likes the fat kid, so Sam's older brother, Rocky (Trevor Morgan), and his other friends devise a plan to pay George back. The idea: invite him on a boat trip, get him to play Truth or Dare, strip him naked and get him in the water, and make the fatass walk home embarassed as can be. What actually happens: every single thing that shouldn't.First of all, George is a nice guy with some issues, and most of the kids in the group decide right quick that the whole plan to ruin him isn't right. Unfortunately, it's a problem with the eldest of the gang, Marty (Scott Mechlowicz), who wants to seek revenge whether George is nice or not. And if you've seen Deliverance (or even the film's enticing trailer for that matter), you know where it's all headed. What writer Jacob Aaron Estes has up his sleeve in the film's masterful denoument, though, is beyond explanation.Most movies involving kids attempt to strike a cord with its audience where the awareness of innocence wipes clean all sins of a child. Estes' script is so precisely shaped that we don't see redemption from the opening moments; every single scene leading up to the film's climactic moment is accompanied by a stomach-churning tension, a sickening awareness that these kids will not behave like the kids we see in most movies. These kids will behave like adults, desperate for a way out, clawing for a solution, and willing to do anything to achieve it. We cringe when we see George doing and saying genuinely nice things as he's led to the water because the kids are cringing inside. We struggle with what to think of him, just as they do, and then things are turned upside and we're left struggling with what to think of everyone else. The cast, led by Culkin, initially occupy the general stereotypes where we see them fit, but then we see how tragedy and circumstance change them. This mostly unknown cast conveys a feeling of reality that did more than send a chill up my spine.That feeling of reality will hit you like a ton of bricks. Mean Creek, though tinged with the earthiness of a David Gordon Green film in the beginning, descends into a shocking moral quandary that makes the insidious ""Dueling Banjos"" of Deliverance seem like a bedtime lullaby. Gone is that cinematic trick of ambiguity (an easy way out for a movie like this), away goes the idea that these kids will persevere, out goes any comfortable solution whatsoever (that the film's solution is so noble is even more sad). Creek is a perfectly plausible set of events that could happen to anyone, and that's what makes it so deeply terrifying.In its final moments, I fought the urge to look away, Mean Creek is so painful to bear. But it's a necessary pain; we learn from this movie, about moral choice and responsibility, and about the power of social dominance and the consequences of revenge. I wasn't just crushed by this movie; I was so scared I could hardly move, provoked only to silence as the credits rolled. This is real stuff, a movie that reaches a new level of effectiveness in that it burrows into your mind and your heart and puts them both in torment. I was reminded more than a few times of Peter Weir's great Picnic at Hanging Rock during the film, probably because - until now - it was the most disturbing, terrifying film I'd ever seen.Mean Creek is a towering achievement, but I wouldn't wish it upon anyone. I'll never watch it again, as I enjoy sleeping at night. It's getting an ""A"" because it's a masterwork, not because it's wistfully romantic like Before Sunset. I'm recommending it because things of this nature happen and we must be faced with them, not because it's fun.

But the cover was eyecatching, but simple, and decided why the hell not.What's amazing about this film, is that it totally focuses on the main characters. There's barely a mention of parents, apart from a couple of brief shots, and most of it takes place on what looks like a very peaceful river. What's the worst that could happen? It's not like they're white water rafting or something. (Which I thought was gonna happen.)Rory Culkin will probably never come out of the Culkin shadows, but he does give it his best shot most of the time, I just wish he didn't play the little boy lost character all the time! Even IMDB won't show an older shot of him on their main page. He seemed a little bit lost amongst all the older characters (Ryan Kelley, Scott Mechlowicz, Trevor Morgan and Josh Peck), and his relationship with Millie (Carly Shroeder) is so innocent, it's sweet to watch.I'm still not sure whether George (Josh Peck) deserved what happened to him or not. And the movie never really says either, it's left hanging as to what happens to all the kids, and lets the viewers make up their own minds. But George did have the ability to push people too far. What would you do in that situation? As it says in Mean Creek, if you could snap your fingers and they would drop dead, would you? It's a very difficult question to ask.I thought the film started to drag towards the end, after what happened to George, happened, and they all went home. It could have been edited a little better there, but I suppose it kept the suspense going.Mean Creek definitely comes highly recommended, and stands head & shoulders above the other teen movies. It's got an R rating, so it's proceed with caution if you're young, but it's a real eye opener, and makes all the other teen movies pale in comparison.",4,Did he deserve what he got?,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,2002,"['had', 'couple', 'misgivings', 'watching', 'film', 'bullying', 'begin', 'having', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'got', 'T-shirt', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'highly', 'recommended', 'had', 'major', 'effect', 'cover', 'was', 'eyecatching', 'simple', 'decided', 'why', 'hell', 'not.What', 'amazing', 'film', 'totally', 'main', 'characters', 'barely', 'mention', 'parents', 'apart', 'couple', 'brief', 'shots', 'most', 'place', 'what', 'very', 'peaceful', 'river', 'What', 'worst', 'could', 'happen', 'not', ""'re"", 'white', 'water', 'rafting', 'something', 'thought', 'was', 'gon', 'happen', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'come', 'Culkin', 'shadows', 'give', 'best', 'shot', 'most', 'time', 'just', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'little', 'boy', 'lost', 'character', 'time', 'Even', 'IMDB', 'wo', ""n't"", 'show', 'older', 'shot', 'main', 'page', 'seemed', 'little', 'bit', 'lost', 'amongst', 'older', 'characters', 'Ryan', 'Kelley', 'Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'relationship', 'Millie', 'Carly', 'Shroeder', 'so', 'innocent', 'sweet', 'watch.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'George', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'deserved', 'what', 'happened', 'not', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'left', 'hanging', 'what', 'kids', 'viewers', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'minds', 'George', 'did', 'have', 'ability', 'push', 'people', 'too', 'far', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'Mean', 'Creek', 'could', 'snap', 'fingers', 'would', 'drop', 'dead', 'would', 'very', 'difficult', 'question', 'ask.I', 'thought', 'film', 'started', 'drag', 'end', 'what', 'happened', 'George', 'happened', 'went', 'home', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'little', 'better', 'there', 'suppose', 'kept', 'suspense', 'going.Mean', 'Creek', 'definitely', 'highly', 'recommended', 'head', 'shoulders', 'other', 'teen', 'movies', 'got', 'R', 'rating', 'proceed', 'caution', ""'re"", 'young', 'real', 'eye', 'opener', 'other', 'teen', 'movies', 'pale', 'comparison']",N/A

Peck is violent, but later we see his creativity and his sweetness.  Unfortunately, he tends to maniacally.An older, troubled teen gets the kids together to teach Peck a lesson.  They invite him on a Saturday hike and boat trip.  In the background is a Rocky Mountain setting, beautiful in the summer, a lazy creek winds through green valleys, forests and farms.  In these surroundings, the children regress from societal novices to a primitive state.  Young Culkin has brought along blonde, impish girlfriend Carly Schroeder.  He lets her in on the intended game of truth and dare that will get Peck out of his clothes in the middle of nowhere. Carly objects on moral grounds.  Each kid weighs his or her intense dislike of Peck and his or her own humanity.  All but the older teen want to back out of the plan simply because Peck is rather nice in a boastful way.At this point, I could blow the plot and I won't, but these kids have a lesson to learn, a serious lesson.  It has been pointed out that the plot is less than realistic, especially after the big tragedy, but the cinematography and scripted pace seem to give a fantasy quality to the film allowing the audience to forgive implausibility.Modern kids are shown to be quite perceptive about sex, alcohol, and pot.

It doesn't really have an Ending, either, not in the strictest sense of the word. And, besides the main event in the film, very little happens.So what makes it one of the best movies I've seen come out of America for many years now?Sam (Rory Culkin) is being bullied by George, a fat aggressive kid. Sam's older brother Rocky and his two friends Marty and Clyde, form a plan to get revenge, and then everything goes wrong. Simple, right?Wrong. The extremely careful subtext and conflicting idealogies of 'Mean Creek' make this ostensibly black-and-white tale of retribution and consequence one of the most richly-woven stories ever put on film. For example, on one end, you have the truly good characters - Sam and his girlfriend Millie, or Clyde and Rocky - whose apathy and lack of real action in the face of all their protestations make for a nice metaphor about the duality of goodness. Similarly, on the other end of the spectrum, ringleader Marty's in a lot of pain since his father committed suicide, and bully George turns out to have the heart of an artist, his violence and rage coming from his dyslexia and obesity.In terms of characterisation, then, 'Mean Creek' doesn't let you get a firm handle on any of the protagonists, but keeps you absolutely spellbound with the quality of the performances from each and every one of the kids in the main roles. It's been a long time since I've seen actors display such a depth of feeling and sensitivity for the subject matter of their roles, and I have to say, there's not one actor here that is anything below excellent. Standout performances come from the brilliant Carly Schroeder as Millie and equally good Josh Peck as bully George, with the rest of the cast doing an excellent, excellent job.Direction is also superlative; it walks a razor-thin line between Creative and Pretentious, but, thanks to the talent of Jacob Aaron Estes, never crosses over into the realms of boring 'Art'. The slow, almost lazy pace of the boat ride and the unclutteredness of the interior shots show a real desire of Estes to allow this story to be seen, and there's next-to-no narrative camerawork to tell us how we should feel. No overlong close-ups on sentimental good guys, no down-looking-up shots of bad guys' expressions - Estes simply points and shoots, and the end result is a film as beautiful in its imagery as it is effective in its simplicity.Wholly recommended as a purchase, this - while not an easy movie to watch, particularly if you have ever been the victim of bullying, or a bully yourself - is an excellent piece of film that has restored my faith in American Cinema. It's a beautiful, well-made and extremely clever film, and its depth will only truly be discovered on repeat viewings.Totally recommended.",4,Excellent!,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,2941,"[""'Mean"", 'Creek', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'feel', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'start', 'somehow', ""'ve"", 'been', 'deposited', 'story', 'somewhere', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'Ending', 'either', 'not', 'strictest', 'sense', 'word', 'main', 'event', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'happens.So', 'what', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'come', 'America', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'Sam', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'being', 'bullied', 'George', 'fat', 'aggressive', 'kid', 'Sam', 'older', 'brother', 'Rocky', 'two', 'friends', 'Marty', 'Clyde', 'form', 'plan', 'get', 'revenge', 'then', 'everything', 'wrong', 'Simple', 'right', 'Wrong', 'extremely', 'careful', 'subtext', 'conflicting', 'idealogies', ""'Mean"", 'Creek', 'make', 'ostensibly', 'black-and-white', 'tale', 'retribution', 'consequence', 'one', 'most', 'richly-woven', 'stories', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'example', 'one', 'end', 'have', 'truly', 'good', 'characters', 'Sam', 'girlfriend', 'Millie', 'Clyde', 'Rocky', 'apathy', 'lack', 'real', 'action', 'face', 'protestations', 'make', 'nice', 'metaphor', 'duality', 'goodness', 'Similarly', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'ringleader', 'Marty', 'lot', 'pain', 'father', 'committed', 'suicide', 'bully', 'George', 'out', 'have', 'heart', 'artist', 'violence', 'rage', 'coming', 'dyslexia', 'obesity.In', 'terms', 'characterisation', 'then', 'Creek', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'firm', 'handle', 'protagonists', 'absolutely', 'spellbound', 'quality', 'performances', 'one', 'kids', 'main', 'roles', 'been', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'actors', 'display', 'depth', 'feeling', 'sensitivity', 'subject', 'matter', 'roles', 'have', 'say', 'not', 'one', 'actor', 'here', 'anything', 'excellent', 'Standout', 'come', 'brilliant', 'Carly', 'Schroeder', 'Millie', 'equally', 'good', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'bully', 'George', 'rest', 'cast', 'doing', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'job.Direction', 'also', 'superlative', 'razor-thin', 'line', 'Creative', 'Pretentious', 'thanks', 'talent', 'Jacob', 'Aaron', 'Estes', 'never', 'realms', 'boring', ""'Art"", 'slow', 'almost', 'lazy', 'pace', 'boat', 'ride', 'unclutteredness', 'interior', 'shots', 'show', 'real', 'desire', 'Estes', 'allow', 'story', 'be', 'seen', 'next-to-no', 'narrative', 'camerawork', 'tell', 'how', 'should', 'feel', 'overlong', 'close-ups', 'sentimental', 'good', 'guys', 'down-looking-up', 'shots', 'bad', 'guys', 'expressions', 'Estes', 'simply', 'points', 'shoots', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'effective', 'simplicity.Wholly', 'recommended', 'purchase', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'particularly', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'victim', 'bullying', 'bully', 'excellent', 'piece', 'film', 'restored', 'faith', 'American', 'Cinema', 'beautiful', 'well-made', 'extremely', 'clever', 'film', 'depth', 'will', 'only', 'truly', 'be', 'discovered', 'repeat', 'viewings.Totally', 'recommended']",N/A

Without blabbing away the plot, a bunch of kids go on a river trip to teach a lesson to a ""bully"". Jacob Aaron Estes has put together a beautifully shot film, with a terrific cast (winner at the Indies). The idea was to make the viewer uncomfortable.  Bullies will be bullies. Sometimes they're your own friends. George (Josh Peck) is a developmentally disabled kid who lashes out and is considered a ""bully"". The local ""cool"" guys figure this out too late, and the REAL bully is Marty (Scott Melchowicz, a great performance), who convinces the rest to do dumb things. The whole cast is terrific, and the young Carly Schroeder and Rory Culkin are especially intuitive and sensible. It's unsettling, and somewhat implausible that the whole event would even take place, but it's great insight into the ideas of young, smart people...until they fall under the spell of Marty. The ending has a sense of redemption; why they allowed themselves to be bullied by Marty in the first place makes no sense to me.

869621,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0006IUDTY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Mean Creek (Jacob Aaron Estes, 2005)There are some movies that get almost no push from their studios, despite said studios having spent mountains on starpower, etc. Sometimes these movies spread through word of mouth after screening at festivals or getting a rave review from a popular critic, and end up as cult favorites. I have found, over the years, that these are something of a mixed batch. Every once in a while you happen on a real gem like The Woodsman, but for every gem, there are a dozen like Mean Creek that simply don't live up to the hype.Plot: Sam (Rory Culkin) is your typical schoolkid; nerdy, shy, and bullied by the school's lunkhead, George (Josh Peck, from TV's Drake and Josh). He's got a few friends, and something that might possibly be a romantic relationship with Millie (Lizzie McGuire regular Carly Schroeder) if Sam would grow enough of a spine to ask her out. One day, George's bullying goes way too far, and when Sam tells his brother Rocky (Trevor Morgan, recently of The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio) about it, Rocky hatches a plan to get even with George that involves inviting him on a fishing trip and scaring him senseless. (And as I'm already halfway through the movie, I'll stop here, even though it's not really a stopping point; we're getting dangerously close to spoiler territory.)The first problem with the movie is that while Macaulay Culkin is a pretty darned good actor (and has remained so while growing up, viz. Saved!), I have yet to see any evidence that his brothers are anywhere near as good. The second, and far more perplexing, problem is that once the climax of the movie hits, the script entirely falls apart. If the movie had ended right there, it might have been worthwhile, but instead we get the final scene, which drags on endlessly. Of course, I'm sure someone somewhere thought the movie wouldn't have nearly as much power if we didn't give these kids time to emote. Therapeutic value, or something. Problem is, no one gave them a script to do it with. (I don't mean this literally--I don't know for sure--but honestly, it wouldn't surprise me.)Had potential, but very little of it was realized.

869625,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0006IUDTY,Samuel McKewon,"[1, 1]","The first 50 minutes of writer/director Jacob Aaron Estes' ""Mean Creek"" are brilliant, a fierce examination of group dynamics and human nature. It's a movie about bullies and prey, pickers and picked upon, and, beneath that, the manifestation of anger and fear into violence that rips into childhood innocence.There is 12-year-old Sam (Rory Culkin), small, smart and sweet, and a girl his age, Millie(Carly Schroeder), equally kind, full of the big questions that boys like Sam will foolishly pretend to answer at the request of girls like Millie. George (Josh Peck) is the older boy who beats Sam; we see Sam's latest transgression against George, which is touching his camera while it videotapes George shooting (missing) baskets. That camera is George's best friend.Millie wonders if Sam would like George dead. Sam isn't sure, but he goes along with a prank designed by his brother Rocky (Trevor Morgan) to humiliate George on a boating trip with a game of truth or dare. Rocky has an older buddy, Marty (Scott Mechlowicz), who's another kind of bully, charismatic and clever, able to bend Rocky and another boy, Clyde (Ryan Kelley) around his wishes. He's all for this prank.Estes sees these kids so clearly. The conflicted Sam and Millie. The decency of Clyde, a smart, gentle kid who wouldn't be in this group of outcasts were it not for his parents being outcasts. The essential weakness of Rocky, a kid who goes along and plays at being worse than he is. That warped leadership of Marty, played by Mechlowicz in a performance you recall later when he gets bigger parts. Marty's circumstances have edged him toward a kind of nihilistic wildness that will eventually put him in jail for a crime he didn't have to commit.  Of the kids on that river he's the smartest and the most fearful - the prank is a way for him to fulfill a fate he's already imagined for himself and seen played out in his family.And then there is George - that particular kind of bully, so in need of attention and love, so incapable of receiving or giving it like a normal person.  He brings Sam a gift for the trip, then proceeds to play with it himself. He asks Clyde for the recipe to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. He's already begun to transform his inadequacies - a learning disability is one - into yet undiscovered talents. ""No one knows what's in this brain,"" he says to his camera. He intends on recording his thoughts and burying them in the backyard for ""a highly evolved species"" to find.This is the kind of personality - a flowering meglomania and taste for cruelty - that one day becomes a killer. Estes slowly reveals it - the kid at first seems like a big, lonely doof - but George becomes an aggressive pain without any sense of danger or retreat. His last speech is so vile and unrepentant that, well, what happens after it is awful and yet, we sense, had the day gone as planned, the end result would have been even worse. You can trace Marty's anger. George is missing some essential wiring.The final act of ""Mean Creek"" turns into a morality play, but the movie doesn't really follow through; it takes us to that moment where the kids, save Marty, are overwhelmed by guilt, make an important decision, but it doesn't reveal the consequences of it. Sam also has a line about his brother that I don't quite agree with; Estes seems to be pulling back just a little from his brilliant evocation of George and Peck's portrayal of him to remorse.""Mean Creek"" may claim to be more ""decent"" for its ""every son has a mother"" moments in the final half-hour. Or more sentimental. But it's interesting that I watched the Robert DeNiro ""Cape Fear"" again recently, and found relief at Max Cady's death in the river. George is not yet Max Cady in the movie. By its end, he'll never be one, and ""Mean Creek"" would be more original if it explored whether that was a good thing. The answer for the survivors could be same, but it's the complexity of a question that deepens the virtue of a choice.",4,The end of innocence on a crystal blue river.,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,3987,"['first', '50', 'minutes', 'writer/director', 'Jacob', 'Aaron', 'Estes', 'Mean', 'Creek', 'are', 'brilliant', 'fierce', 'examination', 'group', 'dynamics', 'human', 'nature', 'movie', 'bullies', 'prey', 'pickers', 'picked', 'beneath', 'manifestation', 'anger', 'fear', 'violence', 'childhood', '12-year-old', 'Sam', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'small', 'smart', 'sweet', 'girl', 'age', 'Millie', 'Carly', 'Schroeder', 'equally', 'kind', 'full', 'big', 'questions', 'boys', 'Sam', 'will', 'foolishly', 'pretend', 'answer', 'request', 'girls', 'Millie', 'George', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'older', 'boy', 'who', 'Sam', 'see', 'Sam', 'latest', 'transgression', 'George', 'touching', 'camera', 'George', 'shooting', 'missing', 'baskets', 'camera', 'George', 'best', 'friend.Millie', 'wonders', 'Sam', 'would', 'like', 'George', 'dead', 'Sam', ""n't"", 'sure', 'along', 'prank', 'designed', 'brother', 'Rocky', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'humiliate', 'George', 'boating', 'trip', 'game', 'truth', 'dare', 'Rocky', 'older', 'buddy', 'Marty', 'Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'who', 'kind', 'bully', 'charismatic', 'clever', 'able', 'bend', 'Rocky', 'boy', 'Clyde', 'Ryan', 'Kelley', 'wishes', 'kids', 'so', 'clearly', 'conflicted', 'Sam', 'Millie', 'decency', 'Clyde', 'smart', 'gentle', 'kid', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'group', 'outcasts', 'were', 'not', 'parents', 'being', 'outcasts', 'essential', 'weakness', 'Rocky', 'kid', 'who', 'along', 'plays', 'being', 'worse', 'warped', 'leadership', 'Marty', 'played', 'Mechlowicz', 'performance', 'recall', 'later', 'when', 'bigger', 'parts', 'Marty', 'circumstances', 'have', 'edged', 'kind', 'nihilistic', 'wildness', 'will', 'eventually', 'put', 'jail', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'commit', 'kids', 'river', 'smartest', 'most', 'fearful', 'prank', 'way', 'fulfill', 'fate', 'already', 'imagined', 'seen', 'played', 'out', 'family.And', 'then', 'George', 'particular', 'kind', 'bully', 'so', 'need', 'attention', 'love', 'incapable', 'receiving', 'giving', 'normal', 'person', 'Sam', 'gift', 'trip', 'then', 'proceeds', 'play', 'Clyde', 'recipe', 'peanut', 'butter', 'jelly', 'sandwiches', 'already', 'begun', 'transform', 'inadequacies', 'learning', 'disability', 'one', 'yet', 'undiscovered', 'talents', 'one', 'what', 'brain', 'camera', 'recording', 'thoughts', 'burying', 'backyard', 'highly', 'evolved', 'species', 'find.This', 'kind', 'personality', 'flowering', 'meglomania', 'taste', 'cruelty', 'one', 'day', 'killer', 'slowly', 'reveals', 'kid', 'first', 'big', 'lonely', 'doof', 'George', 'aggressive', 'pain', 'sense', 'danger', 'retreat', 'last', 'speech', 'so', 'vile', 'unrepentant', 'well', 'what', 'awful', 'yet', 'sense', 'had', 'day', 'gone', 'as', 'planned', 'end', 'result', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'worse', 'can', 'trace', 'Marty', 'anger', 'George', 'missing', 'essential', 'wiring.The', 'final', 'act', 'Mean', 'Creek', 'morality', 'play', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'follow', 'moment', 'where', 'kids', 'save', 'Marty', 'are', 'overwhelmed', 'guilt', 'make', 'important', 'decision', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'consequences', 'Sam', 'also', 'line', 'brother', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'agree', 'Estes', 'be', 'pulling', 'back', 'just', 'little', 'brilliant', 'evocation', 'George', 'Peck', 'portrayal', 'remorse', 'Mean', 'Creek', 'may', 'claim', 'be', 'more', 'decent', 'son', 'mother', 'moments', 'final', 'half-hour', 'more', 'sentimental', 'interesting', 'watched', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'again', 'recently', 'found', 'relief', 'Max', 'Cady', 'death', 'river', 'George', 'not', 'yet', 'Max', 'Cady', 'movie', 'end', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'one', 'Mean', 'Creek', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'original', 'explored', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'answer', 'survivors', 'could', 'be', 'same', 'complexity', 'question', 'virtue', 'choice']",N/A
869626,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B0006IUDTY,Scrimshaw,"[1, 2]","Mean Creek is a 2004 independent drama written and directed by Jacob Aaron Estes which focuses on a bunch of kids who plot revenge on a troubled, overweight bully named George (Josh Peck), during a boat trip. The plan is to ""strip him, dump him in the river, and then make him run home naked"". They devise the plan after George attacks Sam (Rory Culkin), in the schoolyard. The film also stars Scott Mechlowicz, Carly Schroeder, Trevor Morgan, and Ryan Kelley. The film has a pretty dark tone, which contrasts with the somewhat placid, scenic river on which the majority of the film takes place. It has a large amount of vulgarity, drug references, and sexual situations. It calls itself an ""indie"" film but what it really is is a mainstream hollywood film with less action and a lower budget. The whole ""revenge"" plot is stupid, in real life, instead of devising this whole ""boat trip"" scenario Sam would have told his older brother and he and his friends would have beat the crap out of George and threatened to kill him or at least seriously injure him if he ever hurt Sam again. They claim they didn't want to do it because they didn't want to be as bad as George, but if you really think about it, they wouldn't be, they would simply be protecting someone they care about, not mindlessly attacking someone just because they touched their camera. Back to the main point, the film itself actually had two instead of one antagonist, the character Marty played by Scott Mechlowicz is another troubled, violent individual who's picked on by his older brother and possibly by his father who recently committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. It's Marty who seems the most eager to go along with the plan seeing as how he has a history of abuse and tragedy, along with George who is overweight and suffers from dyslexia. I gotta admit it was weird initially seeing Josh Peck in this role, it was completely different than his role in Drake and Josh seeing him swearing and playing such a negative character and from then on I have trouble seeing him as a comedic actor, which he pretty much isn't anymore anyway, so at least that's one positive.",2,Unrealistic,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,2152,"['Mean', 'Creek', '2004', 'independent', 'drama', 'written', 'directed', 'Jacob', 'Aaron', 'Estes', 'bunch', 'kids', 'who', 'plot', 'revenge', 'troubled', 'overweight', 'bully', 'named', 'George', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'boat', 'trip', 'plan', 'strip', 'dump', 'river', 'then', 'make', 'run', 'home', 'naked', 'devise', 'plan', 'George', 'attacks', 'Sam', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'schoolyard', 'film', 'also', 'Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'Carly', 'Schroeder', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'Ryan', 'Kelley', 'film', 'pretty', 'dark', 'tone', 'somewhat', 'placid', 'scenic', 'river', 'majority', 'film', 'place', 'large', 'amount', 'vulgarity', 'drug', 'references', 'sexual', 'situations', 'indie', 'film', 'what', 'really', 'mainstream', 'hollywood', 'film', 'less', 'action', 'lower', 'budget', 'whole', 'revenge', 'plot', 'stupid', 'real', 'life', 'instead', 'devising', 'whole', 'boat', 'trip', 'scenario', 'Sam', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'older', 'brother', 'friends', 'would', 'have', 'beat', 'crap', 'George', 'threatened', 'kill', 'least', 'seriously', 'injure', 'ever', 'hurt', 'Sam', 'again', 'claim', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'George', 'really', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'would', 'simply', 'be', 'protecting', 'someone', 'care', 'not', 'mindlessly', 'attacking', 'someone', 'just', 'touched', 'camera', 'Back', 'main', 'point', 'film', 'actually', 'had', 'two', 'instead', 'one', 'antagonist', 'character', 'Marty', 'played', 'Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'troubled', 'violent', 'individual', 'who', 'picked', 'older', 'brother', 'possibly', 'father', 'who', 'recently', 'committed', 'suicide', 'shooting', 'head', 'Marty', 'who', 'most', 'eager', 'go', 'along', 'plan', 'seeing', 'how', 'history', 'abuse', 'tragedy', 'George', 'who', 'overweight', 'suffers', 'dyslexia', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', 'was', 'weird', 'initially', 'seeing', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'role', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'role', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'seeing', 'swearing', 'playing', 'such', 'negative', 'character', 'then', 'have', 'trouble', 'seeing', 'comedic', 'actor', 'pretty', 'much', ""n't"", 'anymore', 'anyway', 'so', 'least', 'one', 'positive']",N/A

869633,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0006IUDTY,Terry Mesnard,"[0, 0]","Rory Culkin's character Sam says, close to the beginning of the movie, ""You know, if we hurt him, we'd be just as bad as him.""  This theme carries through this entire sad, disturbing and highly effective (not to mention affective) film.The opening shot is of George, a pudgy kid, trying to set up his camera to take shots of himself playing basketball.  When Sam comes into the picture, George goes off the deep end, smacking Sam around and giving him a big bruise next to his eye.  After much decision, Sam's older brother and friend decide to teach George a lesson.  What starts out as a ""harmless"" prank involving humiliation spirals out of control.What works for this movie is the role reversals.  In the beginning, we only see George as the anti-social bully everyone else sees him as.  But then we are shown another side of him that people seldom see, a side that almost makes them not go through with their plans.  It is here that Sam's quote ""if we hurt him, we'd be just as bad as him"" comes into play.  A very mature ideology that is so true in this case.This idea is so relevant in today's society, unfortunately.  With incidents like Columbine and the possible mistreatment of the prisoners at Guantanamo, this statement takes on another meaning.  If you bully the bully, are you still innocent?  Or are you just as bad as him/her?  The social connotation is deeply important.  It probably wasn't planned for a movie about coming of age to also deal with the political-social climate we live in today but the allusion, whether planned or not, was not lost.From the midpoint of the film to the end, we get some truly excellent acting.  Rory Culkin far surpasses his brother's acting skill and he provides a terrific performance of a little kid angry at getting beaten up but yanked along on a revenge plot.  Carly Schroeder gives a very convincing performance as young Millie.  Her acting is by far some of the best I've seen from a child actor.  Kudos to her.  Also, Scott Mechlowicz (from Eurotrip) is terrific giving a great change of pace from his very nice boy next door role in Eurotrip to the grown up bully in this movie.Not only is the acting really well done but the script is excellent.  The dialogue moves quickly and naturally.  There are some excellent lines and some excellent dialogue in it.  Director/screenwriter Jacob Aaron Estes knows how to write dialogue for teenagers.  It's witty, brings in other movie references (Deliverance anyone?) and realistic.What happens when you pass the point of no return?  Where fun and games of junior high schoolers and high schoolers becomes something much more and worse?  Sam and Millie are forced to grow up practically instantaneously based on their decisions and the decisions of those around them.  And it is here when the movie gets very interesting yet hard to watch at the same time.  Overall, an excellent film.  Very powerful and very sad.

I have a feeling this is the sort of film that just gets better with repeated viewings: I plan on buying it someday. It's a simple, well-written, and more or less subtle portrait of a group of kids and the way they interact with eachother.

Either way, this film brings us back to those days of early adolescence, where image and acceptance was everthing. You can almost feel the adrenalin course through these kids. First on the playground, and later planning their revenge. Not to mention the carrying out of the revenge itself. I don't want to give too much away,(other reviewers have, careful for the spoilers) but things go terribly wrong.

869637,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B0006IUDTY,Timothy Kearney,"[0, 0]","The film MEAN CREEK walks through familiar territory. It is a story that tells of a tormenting bully figure and combines it with coming of age themes. From the packaging summary, viewers will know that a bully taunts a boy who has an older brother. The brother and his friends devise a practical joke to teach the bully a lesson, and the plot goes tragically awry. While we may think we've seen this film before, with different actors and slightly different scenarios, writer and director John Aaron Estes delves deeper into the story. The bully figure of George is not simply a mean spirited person. It is obvious he is masking his flaws (weight issues and a learning disability) when he picks on others, and when we see tender moments, we discover it is a defense mechanism to hide his own hurt. George is played convincingly by Josh Peck. People who are familiar with Nickelodeon's JOSH AND DRAKE may recognize Peck as the lovable yet goofy character of Josh and will see his role of George as a harsh contrast (as well as a demonstration of dramatic talent which is not evident in the well meaning but silly Nick sitcom). Another convincing actor in the film is newcomer Scott Mechlowicz who plays Marty, the troubled ring leader. While some aspects of his character are one dimensional (the product of a severely dysfunctional home who is quick to erupt), his character does have motives that no one else in the film understands which makes him sympathetic. The other four young actors are likewise believable in their roles. Rory Culkin as Sam, the young man who is the victim of George's bullying and his brother Rocky played by Trevor Morgan are those quite, anonymous kids that have more going on in their lives than people realize. Ryan Kelley plays a convincing sensitive Clyde who tries to avoid making bad choices, and himself has been the victim of George's taunts as well as the taunts of Marty due to his home life (he has two fathers so his sexuality is called into question). The one young woman in the cast Millie played by Cindy Schroeder of LIZZIE McGUIRE fame is Sam's first girl friend. She has an innocence about her that is not too sweet. She is intelligent enough to realize what is happening, and the first to understand the ramifications. The rural setting of the film is used to its full advantage. It is small town enough to be Mayberry, scary enough to be Deliverance. Viewers see both hominess as well as an isolation which sets the mood for the contradictions in each character.The strength of this film would be the characters. Most are fully developed, and the only character that was not (Marty) was still well acted. The film is fast paced, especially leading up to the tragedy. The initial reactions to the tragedy are likewise well paced and believable. My only objection is the resolution, or lack of one. Viewers want to know what happens. Apart from a clich&eacute; (one turns to a life of crime), we do not get too much of a glimpse at what happens next. This may be intentional, and for some people I know who also appreciated this film, it worked. For me, it fit, but I would have liked more. Of course a little bit less is always better than too much, and this film never gives too much.Just a note of caution. When I purchased this film, I did not pay too much attention to the rating. I missed it in the theatres and was told how great it was, so I purchased it and hoped to use it in an educational setting. Since bullying is a problem in nearly every school, parents and educators may have the same idea I did. The young cast, many of whom are known to young people made me think this would be an extended ""after-school"" special (I am dating myself here). It is not. The language, and one brief scene, may not make this the best choice for some educational settings, except with mature students who can grapple with the very real issues of this film.",4,A Challenging and Compelling Film,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,3900,"['film', 'MEAN', 'CREEK', 'walks', 'familiar', 'territory', 'story', 'tormenting', 'bully', 'figure', 'combines', 'coming', 'age', 'themes', 'packaging', 'summary', 'viewers', 'will', 'know', 'bully', 'boy', 'who', 'older', 'brother', 'brother', 'friends', 'devise', 'practical', 'joke', 'teach', 'bully', 'lesson', 'plot', 'tragically', 'awry', 'may', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'different', 'actors', 'slightly', 'different', 'scenarios', 'writer', 'director', 'John', 'Aaron', 'Estes', 'deeper', 'story', 'bully', 'figure', 'George', 'not', 'simply', 'mean', 'spirited', 'person', 'obvious', 'masking', 'flaws', 'weight', 'issues', 'learning', 'disability', 'when', 'others', 'when', 'see', 'tender', 'moments', 'discover', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'hide', 'own', 'hurt', 'George', 'played', 'convincingly', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'Nickelodeon', 'JOSH', 'AND', 'DRAKE', 'may', 'recognize', 'Peck', 'lovable', 'yet', 'goofy', 'character', 'Josh', 'will', 'see', 'role', 'George', 'harsh', 'contrast', 'as', 'well', 'demonstration', 'dramatic', 'talent', 'not', 'evident', 'well', 'meaning', 'silly', 'Nick', 'sitcom', 'convincing', 'actor', 'film', 'newcomer', 'Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'who', 'Marty', 'troubled', 'ring', 'leader', 'aspects', 'character', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional', 'product', 'severely', 'dysfunctional', 'home', 'who', 'quick', 'erupt', 'character', 'have', 'motives', 'one', 'else', 'film', 'sympathetic', 'other', 'four', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'likewise', 'believable', 'roles', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Sam', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'victim', 'George', 'bullying', 'brother', 'Rocky', 'played', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'are', 'quite', 'anonymous', 'kids', 'have', 'more', 'going', 'lives', 'people', 'realize', 'Ryan', 'Kelley', 'convincing', 'sensitive', 'Clyde', 'who', 'avoid', 'making', 'bad', 'choices', 'been', 'victim', 'George', 'taunts', 'as', 'well', 'taunts', 'Marty', 'due', 'home', 'life', 'two', 'fathers', 'sexuality', 'called', 'question', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'cast', 'Millie', 'played', 'Cindy', 'Schroeder', 'LIZZIE', 'McGUIRE', 'fame', 'Sam', 'first', 'girl', 'friend', 'innocence', 'not', 'too', 'sweet', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'realize', 'what', 'happening', 'first', 'understand', 'ramifications', 'rural', 'setting', 'film', 'used', 'full', 'advantage', 'small', 'town', 'enough', 'be', 'Mayberry', 'scary', 'enough', 'be', 'Deliverance', 'Viewers', 'see', 'hominess', 'as', 'well', 'isolation', 'mood', 'contradictions', 'character.The', 'strength', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'characters', 'Most', 'are', 'fully', 'developed', 'only', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'Marty', 'was', 'still', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'fast', 'paced', 'especially', 'leading', 'up', 'tragedy', 'initial', 'reactions', 'tragedy', 'are', 'likewise', 'well', 'paced', 'believable', 'only', 'objection', 'resolution', 'lack', 'one', 'Viewers', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'Apart', 'clich', 'eacute', 'one', 'life', 'crime', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'glimpse', 'what', 'next', 'may', 'be', 'intentional', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'also', 'appreciated', 'film', 'worked', 'fit', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'course', 'little', 'bit', 'less', 'always', 'better', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'never', 'too', 'much.Just', 'note', 'caution', 'When', 'purchased', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'rating', 'missed', 'theatres', 'was', 'told', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'purchased', 'hoped', 'use', 'educational', 'setting', 'bullying', 'problem', 'nearly', 'school', 'parents', 'educators', 'may', 'have', 'same', 'idea', 'did', 'young', 'cast', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'known', 'young', 'people', 'made', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'extended', 'after-school', 'special', 'am', 'dating', 'here', 'not', 'language', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'best', 'choice', 'educational', 'settings', 'mature', 'students', 'who', 'can', 'grapple', 'very', 'real', 'issues', 'film']",N/A

Is that because warming up to a person might change a person's mind, making them soft when it is time to be hard?

It seems bad, too, and worse still that the kids are trapped in it all afterward.

The story was not really well done when it came conversion and the moments in between some portions of the film left me baffled - and yawning. I didn't know what to think or what to expect; the subject was bad but the way it was carried out seemed plastic and dull. It was like I was watching something that really wanted to artifically move me but didn't sell characters was there, and I wanted to feel but couldn't. Still, this was scrpting and not the actors themselves.for the actors part here, they did well enough. The characters were blank and they filled in some, but the movie didn't have enough to make you feel them better.

869639,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006IUDTY,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","`Mean Creek' follows a small boat trip down the river during one summer by six ordinary American teenagers. The film's story may sound nostalgic like `Stand By Me', but this feature debut film by writer/director Jacob Aaron Estes contains a much more serious matter in it.For this boat trip is actually a cover-up for a revenge plan. George (Josh Peck), one of the six teenagers on boat, is a school bully. As the film begins, you witness this fact through a video camera -- Sam (Rory Culkin) gets hit hard in the face, and is knocked down. To humiliate the bully for shy Sam, Sam's elder brother Rocky (Trevor Morgan), Rocky's friend Marty (Scott Mechlowicz) and Clyde (Ryan Kelly) think of a good plan.To make things complicated, however, Sam's girl friend Millie (Carly Schroeder) the last one to join in the boat trip, does not know their real motive. And the boys learn that the school bully George, clearly overjoyed to be invited to the trip and their friendship, is not just a rich and spoiled boy full of malice, a boy with a complicated background.[SPLENDID ACTING] These six teenagers are the main characters of the film, and adults do not appear more than necessary. These teenagers' boat trip successfully builds up the tension without losing the realistic touch of the film, and because of the fantastic performances from the six players we are sucked into the boat trip which is not without some fun. But even at the funniest moment you sense there is some emotional tension under the surface.It is hard to single out the finest performance from the cast. Rory Culkin, undoubtedly a talented actor, is the nominal lead, but his role as the victim of a bully is a rather passive one. Scott Mechlowicz's portrait of angry and dangerous Marty is wonderful, and so is Carly Schroeder who embodies the lost innocence, but the most impressive is Josh Peck who turns in a great performance as George, brilliant and multi-layered portrait of a bully who refuses to be stereotyped.After one incident on the river, the film's story gets a little weak. That is not because the film is predictable or pulls punches, but because this quiet coda of the film would be the most accurate scenes if this really happens to us. Not exactly a comfortable viewing experience (shot with a digital camera), but `Mean Creek' is always a gripping drama.",4,Going Down the Oregon River with a Secret Plan ...

I really liked this title because of it's huanting realism. There have been movies like that but they are definatly few and far between, like: Midnight Express and The Elephant Man,  I really felt the pain each character was feeling. I understood each of their personalities and what would drive them to such a climatic event. Even though it was accidental, their anger was definalty buliding up. Especially when that guy's brother grabbed his ear and yelled at him about touching his stuff. Afterwards he smashed the bottle with the base ball bat and i knew he was just waiting to try something, anything to let it out. It is a refreshing look at what everyone at one time or another experiences: BEING BULLIED and even though most of us would never go as far as to kill our nemesis we often look for other ways to get revenge.

After reading the summary of the plot and the cast list, I was interested. Unfortunately, I had to wait quite a while to see it, but it was definately worth the wait.MEAN CREEK is a movie that captured my attention from start to finish, and even got me a bit teary-eyed towards the end. The movie is, in one word, amazing. All six main/central characters are under the age of 25 (the youngest being 13 or 14, and the oldest about 23), and are somewhat unknown. I was incredibly impressed by how great each one was, and I found it hard not to feel for each character in one way or another.My favorite thing about the movie, though, was the fact that it didn't glorify being a teenager, but it didn't make the kids look like bad people either. It was disturbing and depressing in a way that I can't describe, but it's been over a day since I saw the movie, and it still creeps into my thoughts every so often.I loved this movie, it's a highly emotional film (done with just enough dialogue - in fact, some of the best scenes have little or no speaking) that doesn't make you think too hard, but should leave you feeling like the last 87 minutes were spent productively. I found myself thinking ""If that had happened to me..."" quite a few times, because of how real the characters and setting were.Highly recommended to fans of Thirteen, Donnie Darko, and the book Mysterious Skin.Overall grade - A+",5,"""I'm a man that likes to follow through with his plans""",1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,1489,"['One', 'day', 'was', 'looking', 'around', 'IMDb.com', 'happened', 'come', 'MEAN', 'CREEK', 'page', 'reading', 'summary', 'plot', 'cast', 'list', 'was', 'interested', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'wait', 'quite', 'while', 'see', 'was', 'definately', 'worth', 'wait.MEAN', 'CREEK', 'movie', 'captured', 'attention', 'start', 'finish', 'even', 'got', 'bit', 'teary-eyed', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'word', 'amazing', 'six', 'main/central', 'characters', 'are', 'age', '25', 'youngest', 'being', '13', '14', 'oldest', '23', 'are', 'somewhat', 'unknown', 'was', 'incredibly', 'impressed', 'how', 'great', 'one', 'was', 'found', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'character', 'one', 'way', 'another.My', 'favorite', 'thing', 'movie', 'though', 'was', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'glorify', 'being', 'teenager', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'kids', 'look', 'bad', 'people', 'either', 'was', 'disturbing', 'depressing', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'been', 'day', 'saw', 'movie', 'still', 'thoughts', 'so', 'often.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'highly', 'emotional', 'film', 'done', 'just', 'enough', 'dialogue', 'fact', 'best', 'scenes', 'have', 'little', 'speaking', ""n't"", 'make', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'should', 'leave', 'feeling', 'last', '87', 'minutes', 'were', 'spent', 'productively', 'found', 'thinking', 'had', 'happened', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'how', 'real', 'characters', 'setting', 'were.Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Thirteen', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'book', 'Mysterious', 'Skin.Overall', 'grade', 'A+']",N/A

The story is not elaborate, but it's intense and real, with some hard to digest diologues. The young cast members all contribute  good performances to make this movie a riveting experience.Sam(Rory Culkin) gets bullied at school by fatboy George(Josh Peck) for no reason. At first, he didn't want to do anything about fighting back, because he was afraid to get in trouble. When his older brother Rocky(Trevor Morgan) found out what George did, he insisted to avenge him. He planned to invite George along to go on a picnic with Sam, Millie/Sam's girlfriend(Cindy Schroeder, and his buddy Marty(played by Scott Mechlowicz, a young Brad Pitt look-alike). While the party of five were rafting a boat up the creek to a remote area where something bad was to be done to George, they played a game a Truth and Dare on each other. It was inevitable that the mean and nasty george would provoke everyone to want to attack him. Everyone tried to stay calm, but Marty was the one that got trigerred to the boiling point and accidently pushed George into the water. George didn't know how to swim, and no one wanted to jump into the water to rescue him until he sunk out of sight. From that point on, everyone was freaking out, and they had to figure out what to do when they found the dead body.....Fatboy George was very abnoxious at first, but gradually, his character deserved some sympathy, because he was just trapped in a world of his own, and no one wanted to be his friend. Maybe that's why he went around to cause trouble, so that he would get people's attention. Josh Peck was very good, and he played it to the point that you would want to hate him for constantly hurting others emotionally and physically.Rory Culkin gave his more challenging performance as a victim of bully. He's gotten much better since You Can Count On Me.Scott Mechlowicz was the one that stole scenes in the second half of this movie. His character was relentlessly wanting to punish George, and being merciless pushed him over the edge.",4,Innocent kids gone too far to get even with nasty fatboy.,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",2005,2289,"['movie', 'was', 'low-budget', 'indie', 'film', 'had', 'very', 'short', 'run', 'theaters', 'had', 'made', 'quite', 'impact', 'when', 'saw', 'year', 'ago', 'was', 'disturbing', 'powerful', 'scale', 'Carrie', 'bully', 'revenge', 'school', 'story', 'not', 'elaborate', 'intense', 'real', 'hard', 'digest', 'diologues', 'young', 'cast', 'members', 'contribute', 'good', 'performances', 'make', 'movie', 'riveting', 'experience.Sam', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'bullied', 'school', 'fatboy', 'George', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'reason', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'anything', 'fighting', 'back', 'was', 'afraid', 'get', 'trouble', 'When', 'older', 'brother', 'Rocky', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'George', 'did', 'insisted', 'avenge', 'planned', 'invite', 'George', 'go', 'picnic', 'Sam', 'Millie/Sam', 'girlfriend', 'Cindy', 'Schroeder', 'buddy', 'Marty', 'played', 'Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'young', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'look-alike', 'party', 'five', 'were', 'rafting', 'boat', 'up', 'creek', 'remote', 'area', 'where', 'something', 'bad', 'was', 'be', 'done', 'George', 'played', 'game', 'Truth', 'Dare', 'other', 'was', 'inevitable', 'mean', 'nasty', 'george', 'would', 'provoke', 'everyone', 'want', 'attack', 'Everyone', 'tried', 'stay', 'calm', 'Marty', 'was', 'one', 'got', 'trigerred', 'boiling', 'point', 'accidently', 'pushed', 'George', 'water', 'George', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'swim', 'one', 'wanted', 'jump', 'water', 'rescue', 'sight', 'point', 'everyone', 'was', 'freaking', 'out', 'had', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'found', 'dead', 'body', '..Fatboy', 'George', 'was', 'very', 'abnoxious', 'first', 'gradually', 'character', 'deserved', 'sympathy', 'was', 'just', 'trapped', 'world', 'own', 'one', 'wanted', 'be', 'friend', 'why', 'went', 'cause', 'trouble', 'so', 'would', 'get', 'people', 'attention', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'played', 'point', 'would', 'want', 'hate', 'constantly', 'hurting', 'others', 'emotionally', 'physically.Rory', 'Culkin', 'gave', 'more', 'challenging', 'performance', 'victim', 'bully', 'gotten', 'much', 'better', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me.Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'was', 'one', 'scenes', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'character', 'was', 'relentlessly', 'wanting', 'punish', 'George', 'being', 'merciless', 'pushed', 'edge']",N/A
