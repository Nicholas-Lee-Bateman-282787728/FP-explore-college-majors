The music is set to colorful visual imagery--toys, flowing colors, puppets, etc., and is a perfect mix of bubbly, fun tunes and more traditional classical pieces. There's a sense of playfulness and humor to the video; parents will love the way it catches a child's attention without being overbearing, patronizing, or excessively cute. It's educational in a gentle, entertaining way, with some good options on the DVD to enhance the experience (the flash cards are great). My son can be in the middle of an ungodly tantrum, and will IMMEDIATELY calm down when this is played. Heck, this is the only thing he'll sit still for!

Well, after repeated viewings probably totaling near 250-300 plus times, it actually doesn&#8217;t get on my nerves.  My oldest son, now 3, likes the anticipation of each new scene, such as when the dog flips over or the spider comes down.  He can actually sing the melody along with most of the DVD.  My youngest, 1.5 years old, sit there and says the word for each toy on the screen, such as &#8216;doggie&#8230;woof woof&#8217; and &#8216;kitty&#8230;.meow&#8217;. A lot of reviewers said this is a great video for getting something done in the kitchen, or you need to distract the kids for a little bit.  I don&#8217;t use it that way.  I actually sit with my kids.  Each time we do something different with the video.  My oldest now dances to each scene in a different style and sings along while he does it.Honestly, when it comes to these types of videos, your child while get out of the videos what you as the parent put into them.  If you switch these on and walk away, it&#8217;s just a numb video they watch.  If you sit with them and talk about what is going on, or engage them in some aspect, your child can get more out of it.  For instance, there is a scene to the tune of &#8216;Twinkle Twinkle&#8217; where they show various items: kitten, dog, duck, lemon, grapes, and so on.  One viewing we will name the item on the screen. Another we will name the colors.  We talk about the train or what actions are going on in certain scenes.  My oldest also asks &#8216;what&#8217;s that&#8217; and I explain what the toy or object is and some viewings he tries to name everything on the screen.As for the music &#8211; it&#8217;s pleasing, even if it&#8217;s not the original orchestra versions.  My oldest at 3 hums and sings these melodies on his own.  On the few occasions he does hear the original orchestra version, he recognizes the tune immediately.This is one of the better Baby Einstein videos.  Baby Lullaby comes a close second to holding the interest and attention of my kids.
