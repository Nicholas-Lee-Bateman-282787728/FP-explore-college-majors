1064823,A14COU5OWHU5RT,B000OONQ8A,Allen,"[0, 0]","When Kevin (Marshall Allman) looks for a way to escape his back-breaking summer job, he enlists in the kitchen at an extreme summer camp with the hopes of spending his breaks on the half-pipe. But Kevin gets more than he bargained for when he teams up with his fellow extreme skateboarder dishwashers, The Dishdogz. He'll have to be more radical than the competition and win the heart of the girl (Haylie Duff) if he's going to keep up with his new crew. But before he does, he'll have to get all his work done, if he's to avoid a thrashing from his surly boss Tony (Luke Perry), who's hiding a secret that's truly old school. In the end he learns the true meaning of skateboarding and how to never give up.",5,Very good!,1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,707,"['When', 'Kevin', 'Marshall', 'Allman', 'way', 'escape', 'back-breaking', 'summer', 'job', 'kitchen', 'extreme', 'summer', 'camp', 'hopes', 'spending', 'breaks', 'half-pipe', 'Kevin', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'up', 'fellow', 'extreme', 'skateboarder', 'dishwashers', 'Dishdogz', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'more', 'radical', 'competition', 'win', 'heart', 'girl', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'going', 'keep', 'up', 'new', 'crew', ""'ll"", 'have', 'get', 'work', 'done', 'avoid', 'thrashing', 'surly', 'boss', 'Tony', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'who', 'hiding', 'secret', 'truly', 'old', 'school', 'end', 'true', 'meaning', 'skateboarding', 'how', 'never', 'give', 'up']",DishDogz

By the time this movie was over I was in love with it. I dont know if it was because my favorite actress was in it, Haylie Duff, or what. But its a great film...even if your not a skateboarding person!",5,Best movie I've seen in a while....,1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,318,"['Well', 'going', 'movie', 'really', 'didnt', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'considering', 'dont', 'skateboarding', 'way', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'love', 'dont', 'know', 'was', 'favorite', 'actress', 'was', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'what', 'great', 'film', 'even', 'not', 'skateboarding', 'person']",DishDogz

I would have thought that kind of movie would have a lot of appeal to the younger audiences of skateboarders. Come one guys!We all really liked DishDogz because it did not have cursing or killing or anything like that. Michelle Lombardo (she was the swimsuit model in the film) was easy on the eyes to say the least.Haylie Duff plays a really sweet girl. She does a really good job here with this part. She also plays in Backwoods, Legacy, Material Girls, and more! :)Luke Perry must not be used to being the ""old guy"" in a movie but he did it well. Laid back and cool without being out of it.Marshall Allman did a really good job as the outsider trying to fit in. I specially liked Tim DePriest as Malone. Every movie needs a guy full of himself that gets his at the end. Without a bad guy, you cannot have a good guy. Tim played the part well as a skateboard snob who is so impressed with himself that he cannot be charming and so we do not feel bad for what happens to him.I think everyone will like the Dish Dogz. They pull pranks on each other without being mean. Way to go guys! And the camp counselor was just perfect for the part. Haven't you seen guys like that? Well done!The camera work on the stunts was great! The location was awesome!It is a predictable movie but still very enjoyable!",5,Very Good!,1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,1352,"['Movie', 'Gallery', 'here', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'copy', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'lot', 'appeal', 'younger', 'audiences', 'skateboarders', 'Come', 'one', 'guys', 'really', 'liked', 'DishDogz', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'cursing', 'killing', 'anything', 'Michelle', 'Lombardo', 'was', 'swimsuit', 'model', 'film', 'was', 'easy', 'eyes', 'say', 'least.Haylie', 'Duff', 'really', 'sweet', 'girl', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'part', 'also', 'Backwoods', 'Legacy', 'Material', 'Girls', 'more', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'being', 'old', 'guy', 'movie', 'did', 'well', 'Laid', 'back', 'cool', 'being', 'it.Marshall', 'Allman', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'outsider', 'trying', 'fit', 'specially', 'liked', 'Tim', 'DePriest', 'Malone', 'Every', 'movie', 'guy', 'full', 'end', 'bad', 'guy', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'good', 'guy', 'Tim', 'played', 'part', 'well', 'skateboard', 'snob', 'who', 'so', 'impressed', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'charming', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'bad', 'what', 'him.I', 'think', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'Dish', 'Dogz', 'pull', 'pranks', 'other', 'being', 'mean', 'Way', 'go', 'guys', 'camp', 'counselor', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'part', 'Have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'guys', 'Well', 'done', 'camera', 'work', 'stunts', 'was', 'great', 'location', 'was', 'awesome', 'predictable', 'movie', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable']",DishDogz
