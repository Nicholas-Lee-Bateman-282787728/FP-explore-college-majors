Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[34, 35]","Yes even autistic people want love and happy endings according to this sweet, often over-sugared romance about two people with Asperger's Syndrome who find they can live without their tics but not without each other.Josh Hartnett delivers a strongish performance as the man obsessed with numbers (Rain Man lite) who lives in a crummy apartment with several birds and their waste products.Radha Mitchell, though lovely, delivers a soft performance as the gal he loves. Her Aspberger's manifests itself in a weird barking laugh delivered at regular intervals and a hatred of the sound of metal clanging against metal.This movie is laudable in that it tries to explain the lives of people born without the ability to relate to others in socially-accepted ways. Its problem is that it pretends the condition can be solved with a Hollywood-style ending. It trivializes the problem and reduces it to a few carefully calculated movie tics without ever penetrating the minds of its characters.It's not unpleasant or objectionable -- just thin.",3,Nice love story that sugarcoats Asperger's,1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,1035,"['Yes', 'even', 'autistic', 'people', 'want', 'love', 'happy', 'endings', 'according', 'sweet', 'often', 'over-sugared', 'romance', 'two', 'people', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'who', 'find', 'can', 'live', 'tics', 'not', 'other.Josh', 'Hartnett', 'strongish', 'performance', 'man', 'obsessed', 'numbers', 'Rain', 'Man', 'lite', 'who', 'crummy', 'apartment', 'several', 'birds', 'waste', 'products.Radha', 'Mitchell', 'though', 'lovely', 'soft', 'performance', 'gal', 'Aspberger', 'manifests', 'weird', 'barking', 'laugh', 'delivered', 'regular', 'intervals', 'hatred', 'sound', 'metal', 'clanging', 'metal.This', 'movie', 'laudable', 'explain', 'lives', 'people', 'born', 'ability', 'relate', 'others', 'socially-accepted', 'ways', 'problem', 'condition', 'can', 'be', 'solved', 'Hollywood-style', 'ending', 'problem', 'few', 'carefully', 'calculated', 'movie', 'tics', 'ever', 'penetrating', 'minds', 'characters.It', 'not', 'unpleasant', 'objectionable', 'just', 'thin']",Mozart & The Whale
1024171,A2WN1QF8GSVHYV,B000J10KO6,Altmed,"[1, 1]","An interesting look into a boy meets girl couple with Asperger's Symdrome ( or A.S., A type of autism that affect people socially) and their friends who are attending a meet-up the main male character set up to be with others like himself. Although it seemed to me, from knowing a couple of high-functioning people with AS (one an adult and one a child) as well as seeing those who are less functioning on the streets whenever in a larger city, that the higher functioning people in the movie seem a little bit extreme as far as physical nuances (although this could be from my limited experience?) They ending (well, actually the whole story) is a fairy-tale with a  Hollywoodized ending. The amazing thing about these special people is that they *do* tend to speak their minds when opinionated, and they *do* stick in the mud when they are confronted, as well as freak out &/or freeze when something is scary to them. BUT, as the director says in the commentary, which is VERY true, these people sometimes just blurt out what they feel, whereas we as a ""civilized society"" sometimes try to blur the issues, make up excuses, or if the other extreme, flat out lie about (or in) social situations, thus there is a lot of every one of us in these two amazing characters.IF you are emotionally true to yourself, this movie will make you laugh, make you cry and cringe.A beautiful story, which to a degree helps us get a glimpse of what Asperger's is about, only misses the family elements these people often grow up with, being told they are odd (at least), or worse being abused and discarded, or at the very least misunderstood and without a clue as to why, until and unless someone seeks treatment for them at an early age. (Our medical system could make testing for this part of a regular check-up, but hasn't yet.) Many not-so-well functioning people with Asperger's wind up on the streets talking to the walls, pushing shopping carts, and such, and are often though of as being psychotic.It's good that someone brought the issue to light, but much more needs to be done! Our medical system adding screening not only for Asperger's, but all types of autism at a young age can help these people get earlier treatment and thus help them function better within our society.If you know someone with Asperger's, it's likely you've probably misunderstood them, if you have a child with it, you've probably got people asking why kind of mother/father/grandparent are you that your child/grandchild would do such-in-such. Much of these behaviors can be corrected if these people get help VERY early on - the earlier the better! By teenage-hood and young adulthood, I understand from someone I know who has it, that it is more difficult to treat (I'd think because re-wiring the brain for using the cognitive to correct the social aspects of the disorder happens much more readily in children and per-teens, and is harder, but not impossible, with older people and adults.)I'm glad to see a film that shows two adults with A.S., BUT the reality is you can probably go to ANY city in the US and find someone (or many people) that have this disorder. While trying to learn more about a friend's disorder, I discovered in our area alone, there are around 100 people looking for help, a support group, whatever contact ad help they can get after a diagnosis of a child or even adults and teens looking for help. It's sadder to see those on the streets we might assume are schizophrenic , who might be much better with help, but more than likely were simply thought of as lazy, different, difficult, etc. when they were kids by the adults in their lives.Perhaps this film will start the ball rolling on autism awareness, as not all those who are autistic are rocking and spinning things!Thanks to those who put this movie out, especially for those who cannot or don't know how to ask for help, or that they might even need it! It's out in the DVD world (And I pray theaters soon!) I hope more will come from this, like the director of not only this film, but BTW he also directed Rain Man (You can see the similarities early in the movie!)Great movies and hope this director and others will catch on that the world needs more films like this, only perhaps not so sugar-coated as this was.",5,"A Glimpse in Asperger's, but sadly not a reality",1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,4276,"['interesting', 'look', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'couple', 'Asperger', 'Symdrome', 'A.S.', 'A', 'type', 'autism', 'affect', 'people', 'socially', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'attending', 'meet-up', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'others', 'seemed', 'knowing', 'couple', 'high-functioning', 'people', 'AS', 'one', 'adult', 'one', 'child', 'as', 'well', 'seeing', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'functioning', 'streets', 'whenever', 'larger', 'city', 'higher', 'functioning', 'people', 'movie', 'seem', 'little', 'bit', 'extreme', 'as', 'far', 'physical', 'nuances', 'could', 'be', 'limited', 'experience', 'ending', 'well', 'actually', 'whole', 'story', 'fairy-tale', 'Hollywoodized', 'ending', 'amazing', 'thing', 'special', 'people', '*do*', 'tend', 'speak', 'minds', 'when', 'opinionated', '*do*', 'stick', 'mud', 'when', 'are', 'confronted', 'as', 'well', 'freak', '/or', 'freeze', 'when', 'something', 'scary', 'BUT', 'director', 'commentary', 'VERY', 'true', 'people', 'sometimes', 'just', 'blurt', 'out', 'what', 'feel', 'whereas', 'civilized', 'society', 'sometimes', 'try', 'blur', 'issues', 'make', 'up', 'excuses', 'other', 'extreme', 'flat', 'out', 'lie', 'social', 'situations', 'thus', 'lot', 'one', 'two', 'amazing', 'characters.IF', 'are', 'emotionally', 'true', 'yourself', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'make', 'cry', 'cringe.A', 'beautiful', 'story', 'degree', 'get', 'glimpse', 'what', 'Asperger', 'about', 'only', 'family', 'people', 'often', 'grow', 'up', 'being', 'told', 'are', 'odd', 'least', 'worse', 'being', 'abused', 'discarded', 'very', 'least', 'misunderstood', 'clue', 'why', 'someone', 'treatment', 'early', 'age', 'medical', 'system', 'could', 'make', 'testing', 'part', 'regular', 'check-up', ""n't"", 'yet', 'Many', 'not-so-well', 'functioning', 'people', 'Asperger', 'wind', 'up', 'streets', 'talking', 'walls', 'pushing', 'shopping', 'carts', 'such', 'are', 'often', 'though', 'being', 'psychotic.It', 'good', 'someone', 'brought', 'issue', 'light', 'much', 'more', 'needs', 'be', 'done', 'medical', 'system', 'adding', 'screening', 'not', 'only', 'Asperger', 'types', 'autism', 'young', 'age', 'can', 'help', 'people', 'get', 'earlier', 'treatment', 'thus', 'help', 'function', 'better', 'society.If', 'know', 'someone', 'Asperger', 'likely', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'misunderstood', 'have', 'child', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'got', 'people', 'asking', 'why', 'kind', 'mother/father/grandparent', 'are', 'child/grandchild', 'would', 'do', 'such-in-such', 'Much', 'behaviors', 'can', 'be', 'corrected', 'people', 'get', 'help', 'VERY', 'early', 'earlier', 'better', 'teenage-hood', 'young', 'adulthood', 'understand', 'someone', 'know', 'who', 'more', 'difficult', 'treat', ""'d"", 'think', 're-wiring', 'brain', 'using', 'cognitive', 'correct', 'social', 'aspects', 'disorder', 'much', 'more', 'readily', 'children', 'per-teens', 'harder', 'not', 'impossible', 'older', 'people', 'adults', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'film', 'two', 'adults', 'A.S.', 'BUT', 'reality', 'can', 'probably', 'go', 'ANY', 'city', 'US', 'find', 'someone', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'disorder', 'trying', 'learn', 'more', 'friend', 'disorder', 'discovered', 'area', 'alone', 'are', '100', 'people', 'looking', 'help', 'support', 'group', 'contact', 'ad', 'help', 'can', 'get', 'diagnosis', 'child', 'even', 'adults', 'teens', 'looking', 'help', 'sadder', 'see', 'streets', 'might', 'assume', 'are', 'schizophrenic', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'help', 'more', 'likely', 'were', 'simply', 'thought', 'lazy', 'different', 'difficult', 'etc', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'adults', 'lives.Perhaps', 'film', 'will', 'start', 'ball', 'rolling', 'autism', 'awareness', 'not', 'who', 'are', 'autistic', 'are', 'rocking', 'spinning', 'things', 'Thanks', 'who', 'put', 'movie', 'out', 'especially', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'ask', 'help', 'might', 'even', 'need', 'out', 'DVD', 'world', 'pray', 'theaters', 'soon', 'hope', 'more', 'will', 'come', 'director', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'BTW', 'also', 'directed', 'Rain', 'Man', 'can', 'see', 'similarities', 'early', 'movie', 'Great', 'movies', 'hope', 'director', 'others', 'will', 'catch', 'world', 'more', 'films', 'only', 'perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'sugar-coated', 'was']",Mozart & The Whale

If you think you know Asperger Syndrome after watching this movie, then you still won't notice them when you meet them. Because what you see in this movie is such a bad portrayal of people with Asperger's. Real Asperger Syndrome is usually so much more subtle than what you see here. The characters in this movie are much deeper in to autism than the average Aspie. They seem to be tending more toward Kanner's autism than Asperger Syndrome. The behavior of a true Aspie can be much milder than what is seen here. Just a little quirky oddness. Something wrong with them you can't quite put your finger on. But much more ""high functioning"" than what you see here.I strongly agree with Nathan Andersen's review of the movie. The screenwriter designed the characters to be living illustrations of the autism symptoms found in the DSM-IV, and not much more. He went down the list of symptoms and had the characters act them out with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It didn't help that the actors didn't really know how to convincingly portray these characteristics. Though I could sense Radha Mitchell's acting talent, even she didn't know how to portray an Aspie.Even as a plain old love story the movie falls flat. The two main characters were obviously never meant for each other. Aspies usually aren't meant for anyone else, even another Aspie. I had absolutely no interest in their petty relationship squabbles. As boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back writing goes, this was pretty lame. Do you want to see a much better portrayal of a relationship with an Aspie? Watch ""The 40 Year Old Virgin."" A more competent portrayal, and a better made movie.There was one accurate feature in this movie which you may not have noticed. Observe how we never saw any shrink trying to counsel these Aspies, either as a group or individually. They were on their own against the normals. Quite an accurate reflection of the fact that shrinks have no interest in helping Aspies.I suppose it was a brave act on the part of the movie's makers to make a movie filled with the kind of people that normal brained people have tuned out of their consciousness. But an inaccurate, almost caricatured portrayal of Asperger Syndrome could damage the cause of Asperger awareness.

1024178,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000J10KO6,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 6]","Based on a true story, this small-scale 2005 drama is well-intentioned in illuminating the plight of those with a form of autism, Asperger's syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes those who have it to be limited in their abilities to fit in with the larger culture. Their condition is generally marked by narrow but intense interests in few subjects at the exclusion of others, displays of socially inappropriate behavior, and peculiarities in speech and thought patterns. Portraying this type of mental illness onscreen is particularly challenging since it requires some distancing from the actors trying hard to stay true to the often alienating medical condition.Written by Ron Bass, who wrote the similarly themed ""Rain Man"" back in 1988, and directed by Norwegian filmmaker Petter Nss, this simple film focuses on the burgeoning love story between Donald and Isabelle, two young, attractive people afflicted with Asperger's syndrome. Donald runs a self-help group afflicted with autism, and Isabelle joins the group upon the insistence of her therapist. The bulk of the film deals with their often frustrating attempts to communicate and work toward a more permanent relationship, while at the same time, supporting the needs of the group to curb their affectations and live satisfying lives. If this sounds like the classic trappings of a Lifetime TV-movie, it pretty much reflects that oeuvre with its video camera quality and barebones production values. In fact, except for the clever Halloween set-up which explains the film's title, the plot turns have a fairly predictable flavor, and Nss displays little flair in making the emotional impact more resonant.Fortunately, the leads do well by their difficult roles, especially when each displays their savant wizardry, Donald's mathematical skills and Isabelle's concurrent artistic and musical gifts. At first, Radha Mitchell seems to be playing a variation of the darker half of ""Melinda and Melinda"" as Isabelle, but she ultimately manages to convey the troubling soul beneath the faade of her flashy bohemian. As the helplessly reticent Donald, Josh Hartnett is surprisingly affecting most of the time, though there are moments when he gets burdened by his character's mannered passivity. Several familiar faces show up in the supporting cast, including Sheila Kelley and a belligerent John Carroll Lynch as two of the group members and Gary Cole as Donald's patient boss. All do good work, but the movie has such a shapeless, haphazard feel that the inevitable ending feels rushed and truncated. The only significant extra of the 2006 DVD is Bass' thoughtful if overly effusive commentary track.",3,Small-Scale Love Story Highlights the Effects of Asperger's Syndrome,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,2666,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'small-scale', '2005', 'drama', 'well-intentioned', 'illuminating', 'plight', 'form', 'autism', 'Asperger', 'syndrome', 'neurological', 'disorder', 'who', 'have', 'be', 'limited', 'abilities', 'fit', 'larger', 'culture', 'condition', 'generally', 'marked', 'narrow', 'intense', 'interests', 'few', 'subjects', 'exclusion', 'others', 'displays', 'socially', 'inappropriate', 'behavior', 'peculiarities', 'speech', 'thought', 'patterns', 'Portraying', 'type', 'mental', 'illness', 'onscreen', 'particularly', 'challenging', 'distancing', 'actors', 'trying', 'hard', 'stay', 'true', 'often', 'alienating', 'medical', 'condition.Written', 'Ron', 'Bass', 'who', 'wrote', 'similarly', 'themed', 'Rain', 'Man', 'back', '1988', 'directed', 'Norwegian', 'filmmaker', 'Petter', 'Nss', 'simple', 'film', 'focuses', 'burgeoning', 'love', 'story', 'Donald', 'Isabelle', 'two', 'young', 'attractive', 'people', 'afflicted', 'Asperger', 'syndrome', 'Donald', 'self-help', 'group', 'afflicted', 'autism', 'Isabelle', 'group', 'insistence', 'therapist', 'bulk', 'film', 'deals', 'often', 'frustrating', 'attempts', 'communicate', 'work', 'more', 'permanent', 'relationship', 'same', 'time', 'supporting', 'needs', 'group', 'curb', 'affectations', 'live', 'satisfying', 'lives', 'classic', 'trappings', 'Lifetime', 'TV-movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'oeuvre', 'video', 'camera', 'quality', 'barebones', 'production', 'values', 'fact', 'clever', 'Halloween', 'set-up', 'film', 'title', 'plot', 'turns', 'have', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'flavor', 'Nss', 'displays', 'little', 'flair', 'making', 'emotional', 'impact', 'more', 'resonant.Fortunately', 'leads', 'do', 'well', 'difficult', 'roles', 'especially', 'when', 'displays', 'savant', 'wizardry', 'Donald', 'mathematical', 'skills', 'Isabelle', 'concurrent', 'artistic', 'musical', 'gifts', 'first', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'be', 'playing', 'variation', 'darker', 'half', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'Isabelle', 'ultimately', 'convey', 'troubling', 'soul', 'faade', 'flashy', 'bohemian', 'helplessly', 'reticent', 'Donald', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'surprisingly', 'affecting', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'burdened', 'character', 'mannered', 'passivity', 'Several', 'familiar', 'show', 'up', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Sheila', 'Kelley', 'belligerent', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', 'two', 'group', 'members', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Donald', 'patient', 'boss', 'do', 'good', 'work', 'movie', 'shapeless', 'haphazard', 'feel', 'inevitable', 'ending', 'feels', 'rushed', 'truncated', 'only', 'significant', 'extra', '2006', 'DVD', 'Bass', 'thoughtful', 'overly', 'effusive', 'commentary', 'track']",Mozart & The Whale

I've read enough about Asperger's to know that most people with Asperger's which is actually high-functioning autism, don't act like lunatics or mentally-retarded.  Most of them are actually brilliant and mild-mannered.  It's mostly a problem of a social disconnection, inability to read people, and interact in manners that come naturally to most people.  In reality, people with Asperger's aren't that noticeable.  Before that label was used, people just called them nerds or eccentric.  What I think happened here is that the writer/s picked out the glaring characteristics of Asperger's and assigned them to the actors.  It looked like a circus.  Even my son couldn't stand watching it.The movie was interesting enough and I'm sure some people with Asperger's can identify with some of the characters' traits.

We will be seeing more of this man's work!With a screenplay written by the talented Ronald Bass we the audience are introduced to the world of 'paranormal' people whose complex afflictions alienate them from the 'normal' world - and therein lies one of the beauties of the film: what is the definition of normal?  Donald Morton (Josh Hartnett) is a bright mathematical genius recently graduated from college but whose impairment from Asperger's Syndrome keeps him from maintaining taxi cab driver jobs.  He is kind and caring and has organized a group of similarly afflicted lonely people whose epicenter is the safety of Donald's group.  The members of this group are beautifully enacted by Allen Evangelista, Sheila Kelley, Erica Leerhsen, John Carroll Lynch, Nate Mooney, Rusty Schwimmer, and Robert Wisdom.  Into this group comes the very beautiful and flaky Isabelle (Radha Mitchell) whose joie de vivre enhances the mood of the group and captures the eye of Donald.  They begin a tenuous courtship hampered by their inherent fears and frustrations but gradually they bond. Isabelle sees how bright Donald is and helps him get a job analyzing computer glitches for a kind employer (Gary Cole).  They find a house to make a home but when Donald begins to strive for a 'normal life', Isabelle is threatened and they part ways - until they discover their own special place in the world.The script is rapid-fire, laced with reality checks on Asperger's Syndrome, but more important it gives a credible story between two people.  Both Josh Hartnett and Rhada Mitchell make these two characters completely believable.  Nothing is pushed over the edge, largely due to the warmth and intelligence of their performances under Nss's direction.  For those who have labeled Hartnett as just a pretty boy destined to play shallow roles a surprise in store: Hartnett really CAN act and hopefully he will continue to seek roles such as Donald and climb the ladder of success based on talent instead of just looks. Rhada Mitchell further proves her importance as one of today's important talents. This is a heartwarming story, an educational film for those unfamiliar with Asperger's Syndrome, and an opportunity to witness some fine ensemble acting.

Mitchell and Hartnett star as Isabel (""Mozart"") and Donald (""The Whale""), two high-functioning individuals diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autistic spectrum disorder, who meet at an Asperger's social group started by Donald, and fall in love.The normal stresses and strains of a relationship are magnified by their disabilities. While Isabel is the more neurotypical, she is emotionally volatile and fearful of relationships. Not surprisingly, she is an artist and a musician. Certain sounds and emotional stressors can bring on bouts of self-stimulatory rocking, narcissism, and histrionics. Donald is less well-adapted, but is more forgiving even while being less flexible. When under stress he reverts to a savant habit of making complex but pointless mathematical calculations, lives in a filthy house, and becomes distraught over changes to his routines.Written by the screenwriter of RAIN MAN, MOZART AND THE WHALE is sensitively handled and treats its characters respectfully. Hartnett and Mitchell each give Oscar-caliber performances as Isabel and Donald, striking just the right tones. It would have been easy (but dishonest) to play the leads freakishly, but both Mitchell and Hartnett bring out the essential, sympathetic humanity of Isabel and Donald, even while they subtlely exhibit the difficulties of living with Asperger's.

Not all people on the spectrum are this blatantly quirky. Quite a few have learned to control many of their eccentricities so that they aren't as obvious. I would have liked to see at least some of these characters doing that. For example, I know someone on the spectrum who controls his echolalia by not exercising his vocal cords and donning a headset in public so that it appears that he's mouthing the words to lyrics. It's confusing for the public when they only get these extreme examples of autism and no examples of the more subtle variations or of those who have learned self-control in an attempt to fit in.I could relate to the challenges this couple had and I felt they were realistically portrayed, however I would caution anyone to assume there are fairy tale endings for relationships of people on the spectrum. The truth is that it is hard for the autistic to connect with anyone, even (and sometimes especially) those who share the same disorder. It can be a lifelong sentence of loneliness, isolation and limitation.It was a good movie and we need to start somewhere, portraying the autistic, getting their stories out in public, and showing that there is some hope for love and success in life.

I watched it twice yesterday, the second time with the commentary track (which is rather sparse, but does give one insight into the production of the movie).I have a very high functioning autistic son, and I totally ""get"" the characters in this movie.  Sure, some of them are rather one dimensional, but this movie is only a bit over 90 minutes long, and most of the time had to be spent developing the relationship between Donald and Isabelle.  I wish this movie could have been longer with even more character development and background, especially for the Isabelle character.I was immediately impressed with Josh Hartnett's convincing acting right from the get-go, but I had a little trouble with the Isabelle character played by Radha Mitchell.  I thought she was just too ""Hollywood pretty"" and together to be a believable person with Asperger's Syndrome.  However, I got accustomed to her looks (easy enough to do) and I realized that her character was very plausable.  Some people with autism just radiate their autism all the time, but others may seem to be just a little quirky or eccentric until an event happens that triggers an unusual reaction.The Isabelle character seemed to be an individual who had likely been through a lot of therapy (that's the character development I wish we had more of) and had developed an advanced ability to introspect and manage her Asperger's Syndrome, but she had her unique vulnerabilities which surfaced in response to certain trigger events.Some might say that this movie didn't give a realistic enough picture of autism and Asperger's Syndrome, but perhaps if it did it wouldn't be a comedy.  (I haven't read the book that this movie is based on, but I imagine it might have more detail.)  People with autism and Asperger's Syndrome can be scary, frusterating, infuriating, brilliant, funny and amazing all at the same time.  At times, I thought this movie made light of autism, but then it was meant to be a romantic comedy, not a documentary, and from the commentary I understand that those who made the film had nothing but the best of intentions.  It is, after all, based on a real couple's story.Other stuff I liked about this movie:The limited use of animated special effects to demonstrate Donald's mathematical capabilities.  Very understated and creative.The soundtrack.  Great indy stuff.  I found myself staring at the soundtrack credits at the end and looking up the artists to see which songs I could get on CD.Filmed in Spokane Washington!Finally, whatever this movie's shortcomings, it is at least a gift for all of us who have autistic people in our lives.

If that sounds all too ordinary, then Donald and Isabelle, the two principal characters, are not ordinary people: they have Asperger's Syndrome, a form of Autism that, among other things, makes social interaction difficult. I also have Asperger's and I want to review the film on that basis. The film starts with Donald, who runs an Autism group for adults. They are an odd assortment but, as the film moves on, you sense that they really are a community of kind, caring individuals who genuinely support Donald through his troubles. One of the members of the group also provides the best line of the film: (said to Donald), `Stick with the group; next to us you're a God'. Indeed, Donald does seem very normal until, that is, Isabelle joins the group and they fall for each other. The film is based on an actual couple and what they went through trying to form a relationship is sad, funny, and immensely touching. For those without the condition, it may also be a little bizarre although, I can attest, this really is the world as we experience it. There are a lot of funny lines - Asperger's people can be very amusing - and you desperately want the characters to find a way of being together by the end of the film. I won't spoil that part for you though. For those without Asperger's, the film is a quirky, offbeat, romantic-comedy that is gentle and good fun.

I missed the very first part and probably wouldn't have paid all that much attention to the film until the lead female character is convulsed by the clanging sounds of carnival rings.  I'd seen somebody--a four year old child--do this before except the aural stimulus was flushing toilets rather than brass rings.The rest of the film was entertaining and informative.  It was sympathetic to people suffering the enormous disability of being unable to accurately relate to their social surroundings.  The film also accurately depicted some of the various manifestations of high-functioning autism of which Asperger's is but a variety.  The film examines, as films will, the social and love difficulties of these people but I am pleased that the screen writers made a real attempt at getting it right.At one time this wasn't true of movies about medical issues.  All the producers were interested in was the drama itself and medical details were largely irrelevant.  Nowadays, I'm glad to see that writers/directors/producers  make a real effort to get the medicine right.  I'm reminded of ""Mr. Jones"" in which Richard Gere plays a manic-depressive with all its high-lows, confusion, depression and exhilaration.  Manic-depression [bipolar] is, however, is a well known entity wheras high-function autism/Asperger's is not.I can guarantee that most physicians and even some psychiatrists/psychologists wouldn't recognize a high-functioning autistic patient if he hit them in the face.  If the child is verbal, intelligent and bright, how could he possibly have autism?  After all, autistic children are non-verbal, sway and bump and have lost virtually all contact with the surrounding world.  Well it ain't that easy.  Most autistic children and adults show ""milder"" forms of autism.Why the spectrum?  I don't really know but I can make a fairly accurate prediction.  Autism isn't a single thing and doesn't have a single causative agent.  It's a syndrome with many causes and with many clinical manifestations.  Some cases may be genetic, others due to pre-natal damage, others due to viral encephalopathy, and others...

Josh Hartnett plays Donald, part-time cab driver who is attracted to numbers and patterns, meets outspoken Isabelle (played by Radha Mitchell), whose honesty often results in conflicts in relationship.Though the film is inspired by the life of Jerry and Mary Newport, the story of two lovers' bumpy road of romance is told in an orthodox way by Norwegian director Petter Nss (`Elling') and writer Ronald Bass, co-writer of ""Rain Man."" Those who want to know more about Asperger syndrome may be disappointed with the film's content. (We don't know how exactly Donald manage the group he has organized for the people with Asperger, for instance.) The film instead stresses the romantic side of the lives of Donald and Isabelle, both of whom go through the rocky process of joy, anger, angst, depression and joy again, but the process of love itself is not peculiar to people with Asperger.But maybe that is the point of the film. Through their romance we come to care these characters, like we did for Bridget and Darcy. The film has fine acting from the leads and supports (including John Carroll Lynch and Gary Cole), but like Sean Penn in ""I Am Sam"" I couldn't help feeling that Josh Hartnett is acting. He is very good as Donald, but still it might have been a better choice for the film to choose a lesser-known actor than Josh Hartnett whose face has already become famous.""Mozart & The Whale"" is a charming little film. (Surprisingly the production company includes Millennium Films, usually associated with B-action films.)

However, its two main characters, Donald and Isabelle, have unique outlooks on the world, since both have Asperger's, a high functioning form of autism. Both are savants; Donald has an extraordinary knack for numbers, while Isabelle is a gifted artist and musician. Despite their unusual abilities, they have a hard time coping with social situations and face other challenges associated with Asperger's. Isabelle gets extremely distressed by the sound of clinking glass, for example, and Donald reacts strongly when Isabelle surprises him by cleaning his apartment and moving his things. While fictitious, the movie--written by Peter Naess of ""Rain Man"" fame--is loosely based on the true story of Jerry and Mary Newport, an Asperger's couple.Radha Mitchell and Josh Hartnett both give excellent performances as Isabelle and Donald. Mitchell does a fine job of portraying a character who appears outgoing, if eccentric, on the surface but is very vulnerable underneath. Hartnett, for his part, skillfully captures Donald's social discomfort and awkward mannerisms. A talented supporting cast plays the members of the autism support group Donald leads.While Mozart and the Whale could have delved deeper into the world of Asperger's, the movie treats its subject with respect and sensitivity. Though the couple faces unique struggles, in many ways the challenges they wrestle with are ones that anyone can relate to in a relationship. Donald and Isabelle worry about revealing their true selves, wonder constantly what the other one is thinking, and deal with the stress of learning to share their lives.
