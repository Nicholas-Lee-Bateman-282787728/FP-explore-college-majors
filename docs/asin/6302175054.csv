299505,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,6302175054,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[30, 32]","At first glance, this film looks like it's going to be a slapstick clone of so many other Blake Edwards' productions.  And, in fact, the film does contain a great many scenes that would tend to belong under the ""slapstick"" genre.  Surprisingly, however, there is much more to this film.The plot centers around a man named Steve Brooks who is a womanizer squared.  He's handsome, charming, well built & has a ""way"" with women.  Unfortunately, he also has a heart of granite & leaves a wake of heartbroken women behind him.One day, 3 ex-girlfriends plot their revenge.  They lure him into a hot tub and murder him.  Steve makes it to Purgatory, but is told he is right on the borderline between having his final destination be heaven or hell.To break the deadlock, God (who is both male & female) sets forth a task:  he must find a woman who truly likes him for who he is (and not for some fast-talking come-on line) in order for him to get inside the pearly gates.  At the last moment, the Devil enters the picture and puts on a twist:  Steve must get a woman to like him AS a woman!Ellen Barkin is marvelous as a man trying to figure out how to be a woman.  Barkin does a particularly impressive job moving like a man thru out the film and her performance truly steals the show.So far, it sounds like your typical gender-switching comedy, only with a twist.  However, the plot contains many more unanticipated twists.  It also deals with some very serious issues that make it nothing short of a dark comedy.  Again, this is quite unexpected from looking @ the cover.I would recommend this film for people who enjoy getting a little more than what they bargained for.  As the religious deities obviously parody the Judeo / Christian tradition, I would NOT suggest this film for people who are easily offended.  In short, the film takes turns poking fun @ men, poking fun @ women & poking fun @ religion.  It turns out to be a good comedy, but a dark one.",5,Surprisingly deep,1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,1953,"['first', 'glance', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'slapstick', 'clone', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'productions', 'fact', 'film', 'contain', 'great', 'many', 'scenes', 'would', 'tend', 'belong', 'slapstick', 'genre', 'Surprisingly', 'however', 'much', 'more', 'film.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'man', 'named', 'Steve', 'Brooks', 'who', 'womanizer', 'squared', 'handsome', 'charming', 'well', 'built', 'way', 'women', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'heart', 'granite', 'wake', 'heartbroken', 'women', 'him.One', 'day', '3', 'ex-girlfriends', 'plot', 'revenge', 'lure', 'hot', 'tub', 'murder', 'Steve', 'Purgatory', 'told', 'right', 'borderline', 'having', 'final', 'destination', 'be', 'heaven', 'hell.To', 'deadlock', 'God', 'who', 'male', 'female', 'forth', 'task', 'must', 'find', 'woman', 'who', 'truly', 'who', 'not', 'fast-talking', 'come-on', 'line', 'order', 'get', 'pearly', 'gates', 'last', 'moment', 'Devil', 'picture', 'twist', 'Steve', 'must', 'get', 'woman', 'like', 'woman', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'marvelous', 'man', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'be', 'woman', 'Barkin', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'job', 'moving', 'man', 'out', 'film', 'performance', 'truly', 'show.So', 'far', 'typical', 'gender-switching', 'comedy', 'only', 'twist', 'However', 'plot', 'many', 'more', 'unanticipated', 'twists', 'also', 'very', 'serious', 'issues', 'make', 'nothing', 'short', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Again', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'looking', 'cover.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'getting', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'bargained', 'religious', 'deities', 'obviously', 'parody', 'Judeo', '/', 'Christian', 'tradition', 'would', 'NOT', 'suggest', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'short', 'film', 'turns', 'poking', 'fun', '@', 'men', 'poking', 'fun', '@', 'women', 'poking', 'fun', '@', 'religion', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'comedy', 'dark', 'one']",N/A

299510,ABFJYHVD8RHLE,6302175054,Hillary,"[10, 10]","Blake Edwards does a fine job of  directing his own original script for his gender, but not comically challenged film.We open with advertising executive Steve Brooks (Perry King), a cad in every sense of the word.  We are clear that Steve has broken many hearts, three of which turn on him at once.  As three of his scorned women decide to lure him into a hotub where he thinks the women have invited him for a multiple seduction, they get their revenge and drown him instead.Now Steve is dead, but hasn't quite reached heaven yet.  I suppose you could say he's in purgatory, until, as god requires, he can get one female to truly love him.  That would be a cinch for the unrepentant romeo except for the fact that at the last minute, the devil intervenes and decides he must get a female to truly love him AS another female, enter a great comic performance from Ellen Barkin.Ellen Barkin playing a female version of Perry King's Steve was great casting, since the two DO look so similar.  Barkin is truly comical as Amanda.  She tells Ad boss Tony Dow, that she's Steve's sister, again, believable.  What's not believable?  A high powered Ad agency letting a top executives sister, fill his now high-heeled shoes.  Hey, no one said this film was realistic.  However, the stepping in and filling anothers shoes becomes forefront, as Amanda takes over for Steve.  She also has to get used to being a woman.  This is not an easy task.  She desperately confesses to one of her murdering ex-lovers who she really is.  The ex then comes to Amanda's aid, teaching her how to do all the things girls do.  Barkin is worthy of Lucille Ball slapstick status as she hilariously teeters around on those hard to fill high-heel shoes, tripping and grasping walls.  She must also remember that since she is a woman physically,  mentally she must think and feel as one too, and can no longer covet fellow women.  All that to keep in mind,  while dealing with lascivious glances and advances from men as well.  In particular she has to fight off boss Tony Dow, and figure out the relationship with her buddy from work played by Jimmy Smits.  Amanda also tells Smits she's really Steve, and he will be the one person that can get her to heaven and out of this jam, but I can't tell you how, you'll have to watch and see!The most confusing part for Amanda will be how she is to deal with a sought after client (Lorraine Bracco) who is a lesbian, and wants a relationship with her.  She could wrap up the deal if she submits to Bracco's advances, but doesn't feel comfortable as a man inside a womans body, making love with a woman who doesn't like men.  Confusing?  Not at all.  I can guarantee you'll be amused at every scene.While ""Switch"" was not a tremendous commercial success for Blake Edwards like ""10"", amongst many others in his career, and treads in a similar water with his ""Victor/Victoria"", it is a highly watchable, humorous and delighfully happy film that you should not miss.  If you are a fan of actress Ellen Barkin, she really shines here in a fine comical AND sympathetic performance.  I mention sympathetic because, when the script and direction are done right, you WILL care about the characters.  When Steve is sent back to earth as Amanda and tries her hardest to find a female to truly love her,  you as the viewer, female OR male, will fall in love too,  with her AND this unique comedy film.",4,See How The Other Half Lives!,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,3399,"['Blake', 'Edwards', 'fine', 'job', 'directing', 'own', 'original', 'script', 'gender', 'not', 'comically', 'challenged', 'film.We', 'open', 'advertising', 'executive', 'Steve', 'Brooks', 'Perry', 'King', 'cad', 'sense', 'word', 'are', 'clear', 'Steve', 'broken', 'many', 'hearts', 'three', 'turn', 'once', 'three', 'scorned', 'women', 'decide', 'lure', 'hotub', 'where', 'women', 'have', 'invited', 'multiple', 'seduction', 'get', 'revenge', 'drown', 'instead.Now', 'Steve', 'dead', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reached', 'heaven', 'yet', 'suppose', 'could', 'say', 'purgatory', 'god', 'can', 'get', 'one', 'female', 'truly', 'love', 'would', 'be', 'cinch', 'unrepentant', 'romeo', 'fact', 'last', 'minute', 'devil', 'intervenes', 'must', 'get', 'female', 'truly', 'love', 'female', 'enter', 'great', 'comic', 'performance', 'Ellen', 'Barkin.Ellen', 'Barkin', 'playing', 'female', 'version', 'Perry', 'King', 'Steve', 'was', 'great', 'casting', 'two', 'DO', 'look', 'so', 'similar', 'Barkin', 'truly', 'comical', 'Amanda', 'Ad', 'boss', 'Tony', 'Dow', 'Steve', 'sister', 'again', 'believable', 'What', 'not', 'believable', 'high', 'powered', 'Ad', 'agency', 'letting', 'top', 'executives', 'sister', 'fill', 'now', 'high-heeled', 'shoes', 'Hey', 'one', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'realistic', 'However', 'stepping', 'filling', 'anothers', 'shoes', 'becomes', 'forefront', 'Amanda', 'over', 'Steve', 'also', 'get', 'used', 'being', 'woman', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'desperately', 'one', 'murdering', 'ex-lovers', 'who', 'really', 'ex', 'then', 'Amanda', 'aid', 'teaching', 'how', 'do', 'things', 'girls', 'do', 'Barkin', 'worthy', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'slapstick', 'status', 'teeters', 'hard', 'fill', 'high-heel', 'shoes', 'tripping', 'grasping', 'walls', 'must', 'also', 'remember', 'woman', 'physically', 'mentally', 'must', 'think', 'feel', 'one', 'too', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'covet', 'fellow', 'women', 'keep', 'mind', 'dealing', 'lascivious', 'glances', 'advances', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'particular', 'fight', 'off', 'boss', 'Tony', 'Dow', 'figure', 'out', 'relationship', 'buddy', 'work', 'played', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Amanda', 'also', 'Smits', 'really', 'Steve', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'get', 'heaven', 'jam', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'most', 'confusing', 'part', 'Amanda', 'will', 'be', 'how', 'deal', 'sought', 'client', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'who', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'could', 'wrap', 'up', 'deal', 'Bracco', 'advances', ""n't"", 'feel', 'comfortable', 'man', 'womans', 'body', 'making', 'love', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'men', 'Confusing', 'Not', 'can', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amused', 'scene.While', 'Switch', 'was', 'not', 'tremendous', 'commercial', 'success', 'Blake', 'Edwards', '10', 'amongst', 'many', 'others', 'career', 'treads', 'similar', 'water', 'Victor/Victoria', 'highly', 'watchable', 'humorous', 'delighfully', 'happy', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'are', 'fan', 'actress', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'really', 'here', 'fine', 'comical', 'AND', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'mention', 'sympathetic', 'when', 'script', 'direction', 'are', 'done', 'right', 'WILL', 'care', 'characters', 'When', 'Steve', 'sent', 'back', 'earth', 'Amanda', 'hardest', 'find', 'female', 'truly', 'love', 'viewer', 'female', 'OR', 'male', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'too', 'AND', 'unique', 'comedy', 'film']",N/A

299527,ALSKUJF2WZ44L,6302175054,Windwolfess,"[3, 3]","""Switch"" is another movie to explore the differences between men and women in a light romantic comedy setting.  Steve, a selfish womanizer is lured by three of his previous conquests to a night he imagines will fulfill his lusts in the arms of these women.  Instead, Steve is shot by them after a botched drowning attempt in the hot tub.  God refuses to let Steve into Heaven until he can find one woman who truly loves him unconditionally.  In much the manner of Job, Satan has a chance to bedevil the situation by returning Steve as a gorgeous woman, Amanda, who receives the same treatment from the men she meets that Steve would have given her.  The movie's plot focuses on Steve/Amanda's attempt to find one woman who loves him unconditionally.  There are several very funny scenes and twists as Amanda tries to look up old girlfriends who universally hated the old Steve, a lesbian client with a big account, and several men.  She begins to fall in love with Steve's former best friend, and of course, Amanda finally does find a woman who loves her unconditionally in a very clever ending, but only after she learns how to give unconditional love.There nothing deep about this movie, but it certainly will make you snuggle closer to the person you're watching it with while you're enjoying this clever little whimsey about giving and receiving love.",3,A nice movie to share on a cold night,1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,1355,"['Switch', 'movie', 'explore', 'differences', 'men', 'women', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'setting', 'Steve', 'selfish', 'womanizer', 'lured', 'three', 'previous', 'conquests', 'night', 'will', 'fulfill', 'lusts', 'arms', 'women', 'Instead', 'Steve', 'shot', 'botched', 'drowning', 'attempt', 'hot', 'tub', 'God', 'let', 'Steve', 'Heaven', 'can', 'find', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'truly', 'unconditionally', 'much', 'manner', 'Job', 'Satan', 'chance', 'bedevil', 'situation', 'returning', 'Steve', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'Amanda', 'who', 'same', 'treatment', 'men', 'Steve', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'plot', 'Steve/Amanda', 'attempt', 'find', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'unconditionally', 'are', 'several', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'twists', 'Amanda', 'look', 'up', 'old', 'girlfriends', 'who', 'universally', 'hated', 'old', 'Steve', 'lesbian', 'client', 'big', 'account', 'several', 'men', 'fall', 'love', 'Steve', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'course', 'Amanda', 'finally', 'find', 'woman', 'who', 'unconditionally', 'very', 'clever', 'ending', 'only', 'how', 'give', 'unconditional', 'love.There', 'nothing', 'deep', 'movie', 'certainly', 'will', 'make', 'snuggle', 'closer', 'person', ""'re"", 'watching', ""'re"", 'enjoying', 'clever', 'little', 'whimsey', 'giving', 'receiving', 'love']",N/A
