1651334,A385SBEEJ15HHJ,B00CVHRCTM,Cindy Navarro,"[0, 0]","Inspired by true stories from Royal Family KIDS, Inc., this is a film that draws you in, breaks your heart, makes you laugh, and leaves you with both hope for these kids and a desire to make a difference. My attitude, much like Ken's, changed from when I first started watching the movie as I begin to see beyond the actors and situations that seemed like standard characters/plots that set the standard for many formulaic films. There is [mild] bad language coming out of the mouths of some of the kids (PG 13), but it fits the defiant characters of some. I also confess that I initially disliked the Redford character, but his optimism and vulnerability melted away my reserve as I both considered the pain this child has suffered and admired the joy he displayed and the kindness he genuinely displayed toward others.I attended a few church camps when I was younger, and the film brought back memories of friends, activities and the required camp singalongs! The difference is that these kids are those who have been abused, neglected, abandoned, and this week of camp may be the only fun in their lives for the year. There are only 5 short days to show the kids that they are valuable, loved, and have a reason to hope...but it is well worth it. My favorite character, Sgt. Sam, tells Ken, ""You're not the foster parent or the caregiver. You're not the teacher. You're just here to help the kid have fun for one week.""Directed by Jacob Roebuck, CAMP is a film that you can enjoy watching for the story, but one that I hope inspires more to make a difference in a child's life. The acting was good and the scenery was gorgeous. Glimpses of the inner fears of the kids break your heart, but the way the counselors handle each situation demonstrates a hope that the kids can cling to for their future. The letters of encouragement sent and shared were among my favorite scenes. A film on a tough subject, but interspersed with enough humor to keep it uplifting. There are several BTS & personal story videos included in Special Features, plus there is a Director's Commentary!! Well done!Disclaimer: I was provided with a copy of  this dvd for review purposes.

Based on true stories it is said not just to entertain but to inspire!I guarantee you will not soon forget it!It is not an easy tale to hear or see but Eli's story (and those of his camp mates!) is well worth a moment of your time for this is what so many foster children face daily: abandonment, abuse, betrayal, lack of love and support to name just a few.Some like Eli are more than a challenge for their caretakers/ counselors as Ken soon finds out! For one week, these children are given the opportunity to be happy and carefree and the outstanding work of the counselors can make a difference in their lives!Camp is the story of one such ten year old child named Eli and a reluctant counselor whom despite his initial annoyance with his assigned camper learns to care enough to reach out to the troubled boy. Ken of course is not your usual counselor...Face it, he drives a Porshe and he is only there to impress a potential client!The movie showcases some of the cases documented by Royal Family Kids counselors and will have you laughing and crying!The actors (Michael Mattera as Eli's counselor and Miles Elliott as Eli) did a wonderful job in reenacting this moving story but for my part Asante Jones in the role of Counselor Samuel wins top marks: he is unforgettable!Despite its epilogue which I felt a bit too good to be true (albeit yet again based on a true story!)

Such is the case on the latest DVD from Word Films, CAMP. Based on true stories from camp counselors, founders of Royal Family Kids and even former campers, CAMP takes a look through the ways in which volunteers who work at CAMP Pine, one week a year to help troubled kids forget their personal problems and provide a way to have fun and be loved in ways they could only imagine.Ken Matthews is your typical ego centered financial advisor who believes that life revolves around making even more money than he already has. When a potential client is about to slip through his fingers, his assistant convinces her that Ken has offered to volunteer at a summer camp she sponsors as a way to give back to the community. Seeing this as a chance to secure the deal of a lifetime, Ken agrees to head to a camp for young kids believing it will simply be a piece of cake. He is instructed to read the rules of being a volunteer counselor since he is joining pretty late into the program, which he believes is optional and more trouble than it's worth. He fails to understand just what he has signed up for until he arrives at Camp Pine and finds himself as Eli's counselor.Eli is a young boy who has been abused by both of his parents and now lives in Foster care. His whole life has been a series of reminders that he is neither good enough or worthy enough of any love. What he finds in Ken is someone who reminds him of his parents, someone who is buying their time until they are rid of Eli. So Eli lashes out at not only Ken but the other kids in camp further isolating himself from the group in an attempt to justify how everyone in his life has made him feel. Will Ken be able to find a way to reach Eli before he does something that will not only risk his own life but the lives of everyone at camp?I received CAMP compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review and received no monetary compensation for a favorable review. This is a hard film to watch since it involves the abuse of a young boy, but we can't just pretend these things don't happen because we don't want to see them. The best part of this DVD is the incredible organization Royal Family KIDS which the true inspiration that makes this a must see. It will move you to tears and will hopefully move you to action either in involving yourself as a volunteer for Royal Family KIDS or even to financial support them in any way possible.
