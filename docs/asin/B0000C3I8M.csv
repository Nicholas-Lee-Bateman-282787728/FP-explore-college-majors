773428,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B0000C3I8M,Brent Butler,"[0, 0]","This isn't, on the average, the type of movie I normally watch. However I found myself quickly caught up in the story of this small 1950s farming family, and the dialogue and moods feel true. Although I was a young boy years later than this movie is set, a lot had not changed and family dynamics as portrayed here were recent family history.I too had an uncle who went to find work in Chicago's factories in the early 50s. I had close relatives on small farms with outhouses and slat floors in the kitchen where crumbs were swept into the crawlspace, and fresh paint was a luxury.This movie adroitly captures all of that, along with the daily lives and small adventures of country folks who get along day by day, and somehow find a way to persevere when faced with adversity. It is told from the standpoint of a small boy for whom all of this is just life. He knows no better nor different.This is the history of countless families all over this country, and it somehow seems important to me that it not be forgotten. I thank Grisham for his look back, and having seen the abridged version that the movie must present, I'm interested to see what else the novel holds.Recommended.",5,This will have me reading the book,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,1180,"[""n't"", 'average', 'type', 'movie', 'normally', 'watch', 'However', 'found', 'quickly', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'small', '1950s', 'farming', 'family', 'dialogue', 'moods', 'feel', 'true', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'years', 'later', 'movie', 'set', 'lot', 'had', 'not', 'changed', 'family', 'dynamics', 'portrayed', 'here', 'were', 'recent', 'family', 'history.I', 'too', 'had', 'uncle', 'who', 'went', 'find', 'work', 'Chicago', 'factories', 'early', '50s', 'had', 'close', 'relatives', 'small', 'farms', 'outhouses', 'slat', 'floors', 'kitchen', 'where', 'crumbs', 'were', 'swept', 'crawlspace', 'fresh', 'paint', 'was', 'luxury.This', 'movie', 'adroitly', 'daily', 'lives', 'small', 'adventures', 'country', 'folks', 'who', 'get', 'along', 'day', 'day', 'somehow', 'find', 'way', 'persevere', 'when', 'faced', 'adversity', 'told', 'standpoint', 'small', 'boy', 'whom', 'just', 'life', 'better', 'different.This', 'history', 'countless', 'families', 'country', 'somehow', 'important', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'thank', 'Grisham', 'look', 'back', 'having', 'seen', 'abridged', 'version', 'movie', 'must', 'present', ""'m"", 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'novel', 'holds.Recommended']",N/A

We were not disappointed.This story takes place in Arkansas and is set in September of 1952.  The Chandler family owns a farm. They grow cotton and hire both, Mexican migrant workers and Hill people, to pick their crop. The two groups clash when they meet on the Chandler farm.  The story is told by 10 year old Luke Chandler. Logan Lerman gave a memorable performance as Luke. The entire cast was good, and we also enjoyed Scott Glenn in the role of Luke's grandfather.John Grisham's books are always captivating, but this is my favorite. I wish that he would write more stories like this one.  It gave us a look at America in a different era when baseball was an American past time and families worked together for a common goal.

Apparently, based on reviews of the book on which it is based, this film is very watered down, which is ratherapparent in the fact that not much of interest happens, and there doesn't seem to be any specific goal that the film isaiming for.  It doesn't leave the viewer with much reason for why painting this house is so important.  This is not LoganLerman's fault, but rather the script writer and the director, who I guess decided that since Hallmark is supposed to befamily friendly, had to remove aspects of the original story.

Our main character is Luke, played by Logan Lerman, a young boy living with his farming family in rural Arkansas, where cotton is the primary crop.  As the season's migrant workers come looking for cotton-picking jobs, Luke makes new friends and enemies, all the while he is trying to figure who is suddenly painting his family's house white.  This adaptation is definitely loyal to its source material (barely anything is changed) but I wonder if this was worth adapting.  While this story was pretty interesting in its book form, it was a bit quiet and boring on the screen.  Perhaps some more things should have been changed or this wasn't an ideal story to be adapted to begin with.  Even it's most intense moments, and there are a couple, were pretty quiet.
