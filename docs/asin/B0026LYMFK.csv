It's a storehouse of tremendous energy?  This Scottish chapel figures prominently in Dan Brown's DaVinci Code and according to Brian Allen, whose testimony is central to this DVD, the power of the place can still be felt.  It's a riveting eyewitness account, but like all such narratives, difficult to prove.  What's more convincing is Brian Allen's assertion that if the Universe can be formed in a nano-second from absolute Nothingness, then other difficult-to-fathom ideas might be possible as well.  Although it promises to uncover the secrets of the Knights Templar, this isn't the focus of the film at all.  It's more concerned with what this ""other world"" is and how Rosslyn Chapel might lead to it.",3,"Fascinating stuff, but I'm still a doubter",1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,825,"['Rosslyn', 'Chapel', 'portal', 'world', 'next', 'world', 'Rosslyn', 'Chapel', 'identical', 'Solomon', 'Temple', 'storehouse', 'tremendous', 'energy', 'Scottish', 'chapel', 'figures', 'prominently', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'DaVinci', 'Code', 'according', 'Brian', 'Allen', 'testimony', 'central', 'DVD', 'power', 'place', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'felt', 'riveting', 'eyewitness', 'account', 'such', 'narratives', 'difficult', 'prove', 'What', 'more', 'convincing', 'Brian', 'Allen', 'assertion', 'Universe', 'can', 'be', 'formed', 'nano-second', 'absolute', 'Nothingness', 'then', 'other', 'difficult-to-fathom', 'ideas', 'might', 'be', 'possible', 'well', 'uncover', 'secrets', 'Knights', 'Templar', ""n't"", 'focus', 'film', 'more', 'concerned', 'what', 'other', 'world', 'how', 'Rosslyn', 'Chapel', 'might', 'lead']",The Rosslyn Frequency: Uncovering the Hidden World of the Knights Templar

This DVD does not have any useful historic information about neither the knights Templar nor Rosslyn Chapel. It only has few seconds of the chapel footage. Most of the film duration is computer generated graphics and psychedelic effects which resemble video games.This time filler is alternate with the author interview segments about his ideas on how Rosslyn Chapel could be a portal to another dimension. He tries to link physics law and medieval music theory that have no connection.

The Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland is purportedly an incredibly haunted site.  Well, I love documentaries, movies, and books about hauntings!  In fact, I can't count how many times I read and watched The Amityville Horror.  That house was supposedly on a vortex that allowed spirits to pass through from their world to ours, wreaking havoc on anyone in the vicinity.  Rosslyn Chapel is much the same.  It sits on an energy hotspot where spirits from the beyond can communicate with us and pass back and forth.They say we shouldn't fear the dead, but I have to admit that this film was downright spooky at times!  And what history!  The church has been around for nearly 600 years.  Anything that old had to experience some really odd things throughout time.
