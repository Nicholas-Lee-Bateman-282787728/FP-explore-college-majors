1104632,A4PTUEVFE13K6,B000VWQTVG,Allen Chapman,"[8, 10]","Season Two of Gene Simmon's Family Jewels finds the Simmons clan dealing with plastic surgery, taking a trip to London and much more, the Camp Pendleton episode is a season highlight. Family Jewels is much like The Osbournes, the difference is that Gene and Co. are much more fun to be around. This is a family that truly loves each other. As eldest son Nick says ""Outside of this house dad is ""Gene Simmons ~ Rock God"" but at the house he's.......well he's more like Richard Simmons"". That sums it up perfectly.This set includes all 23 episodes from season two as well as a bonus episode. If you liked the first season, you'll like this one as well. The only complaint I have about this season is many of the escapades come off as very scripted, in particular from the people outside the house in the real world. We all know that reality TV isn't exactly real, but there are moments in this season where it's just over the top. Aside from that, this is a great show with a great family that you wouldn't mind being invited over to spend a day with.",4,The family you'd like to hang out with...,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,1049,"['Season', 'Two', 'Gene', 'Simmon', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'Simmons', 'clan', 'dealing', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'taking', 'trip', 'London', 'much', 'more', 'Camp', 'Pendleton', 'episode', 'season', 'highlight', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'much', 'Osbournes', 'difference', 'Gene', 'Co.', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'be', 'around', 'family', 'truly', 'other', 'eldest', 'son', 'Nick', 'Outside', 'house', 'dad', 'Gene', 'Simmons', '~', 'Rock', 'God', 'house', '.well', 'more', 'like', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'sums', 'up', 'perfectly.This', 'set', '23', 'episodes', 'season', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'bonus', 'episode', 'liked', 'first', 'season', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'season', 'many', 'escapades', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'scripted', 'particular', 'people', 'house', 'real', 'world', 'know', 'reality', 'TV', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'real', 'are', 'moments', 'season', 'where', 'just', 'top', 'Aside', 'great', 'show', 'great', 'family', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'being', 'invited', 'spend', 'day']",N/A

It's so addictive and fun to watch as poor Gene lands himself in trouble or gets grief given to him by Shannon and the kids.  I'm not a Kiss fan and I don't think you have to be to appreciate this show and Gene himself.This season was as good as the first.  There were more episodes which was fine by me, as I watched them all in one weekend.  I think some of my favourites was Nick stuck at the charity date with all the girls, the family going away for the weekend and finding a bear invading their space along with a snake, Gene getting a 'back massager' stuck to his hand and him hopping into a car without an opening door in Vegas to name a few.  Each episode brings about something funny so they are all good and he really does seem like such a nice guy.  He loves his kids a lot and they have lots of fun together as a family.You really have to see this for yourself to grasp his popularity still and how 'normal' he and they are.  It's a nice way to spend a quiet or rainy weekend.  It's definately one of the best reality shows out there now.

1104638,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B000VWQTVG,R.A. McKenzie,"[5, 5]","I hate all reality TV except for the ""UFC Ultimate Fighter"" seasons.  Yet, I loved the 1st season of ""Gene Simmons' Family Jewels', and mostly enjoyed this season.The basic premise is that we are allowed into the daily lives and adventures of KISS icon Gene Simmons, his former Playmate girlfriend of 23 years (""happily unmarried"") Shannon Tweed, and their two teens Nick & Sophie.Probably everything you've read about this show is true.  The family is very likable & endearing, and the show is often hysterical.  But the show's entertainment value is diminshed only by a few over-the-top scenarios.  I believe Gene Simmons is as big as they come with presentation and image, because Season One perfectly captured how he endlessly works on his marketing campaigns and KISS legacy.  But somehow bringing the Clippers cheerleaders to a beach volleyball game, being suckered while in London, or having Carrot Top ruin a......never mind -- it sometimes feels even less real than you think it will.I thought Season One was surprisingly moving, and reality TV I would watch again.  Season Two is twice as long, and requires an even bigger grain of salt.  There are some terrific moments including a trip to Camp Pendleton and plastic surgery repercussions, and there are the aforementioned ""fake"" moments.  In short, this season is just as funny, but not as gripping.Also, the Extras are severely lacking this time.  Season One had more deleted Couch Interviews, and an hour of bonus footage into Gene's house and everyday work.  Season Two has a bonus best-of episode, and a few Couch Interviews.All in all, I own Season Two and enjoy it, warts and all---Season One = 9.0 / 10---Season Two = 7.5 / 10",4,Fake Reality TV...Oddly Compelling,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,1695,"['hate', 'reality', 'TV', 'UFC', 'Ultimate', 'Fighter', 'seasons', 'loved', '1st', 'season', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'mostly', 'enjoyed', 'season.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'are', 'allowed', 'daily', 'lives', 'adventures', 'KISS', 'icon', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'former', 'Playmate', 'girlfriend', '23', 'years', 'happily', 'unmarried', 'Shannon', 'Tweed', 'two', 'teens', 'Nick', 'Sophie.Probably', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'read', 'show', 'true', 'family', 'very', 'likable', 'endearing', 'show', 'often', 'hysterical', 'show', 'entertainment', 'value', 'diminshed', 'only', 'few', 'over-the-top', 'scenarios', 'believe', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'as', 'big', 'come', 'presentation', 'image', 'Season', 'One', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'how', 'endlessly', 'marketing', 'campaigns', 'KISS', 'legacy', 'somehow', 'bringing', 'Clippers', 'cheerleaders', 'beach', 'volleyball', 'game', 'being', 'suckered', 'London', 'having', 'Carrot', 'Top', 'ruin', 'never', 'mind', 'sometimes', 'feels', 'even', 'less', 'real', 'think', 'thought', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'moving', 'reality', 'TV', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'Season', 'Two', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'even', 'bigger', 'grain', 'salt', 'are', 'terrific', 'moments', 'including', 'trip', 'Camp', 'Pendleton', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'repercussions', 'are', 'aforementioned', 'fake', 'moments', 'short', 'season', 'just', 'funny', 'not', 'gripping.Also', 'Extras', 'are', 'severely', 'lacking', 'time', 'Season', 'One', 'had', 'more', 'deleted', 'Couch', 'Interviews', 'hour', 'bonus', 'footage', 'Gene', 'house', 'everyday', 'work', 'Season', 'Two', 'bonus', 'best-of', 'episode', 'few', 'Couch', 'Interviews.All', 'own', 'Season', 'Two', 'enjoy', 'warts', '-Season', 'One', '9.0', '/', '10', '-Season', 'Two', '=', '7.5', '10']",N/A
