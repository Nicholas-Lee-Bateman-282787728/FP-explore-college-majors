Combining the celebrated innocence of childhood with a story that shares their culture, the film doesn't miss.  It all starts when a nine-year-old boy, Ali, loses his sister's (Zahra's) shoes he's picked up from the cobbler when he stops at the market to pick up groceries.  Watching the film, I couldn't help but think of all we take for granted in the affluent West.We begin the film with their neighbors arguing over water use for showering and washing clothes.  Knowing he's going to get it from a father who's five months behind in the rent, Ali does everything conceivable to conceal their loss.  Daily Ali and Zhaki exchange his sneakers for his sandals in a race against time.  (He has to sprint to school after her session ends.)  All the running gets Ali in trouble with the principal who won't tolerate tardy students, but it also gives him an opportunity:  He gets a chance to enter a race where third prize is a pair of new sneakers.Deceptively simple as a plot, the character and story development are special enough to create a magnetic interest.  With beautiful sequences that are touching and brilliant in their simplicity, 'Children of Heaven' spreads the joyful effervescence of childhood as a special import!",5,Prized Possessions,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,1283,"['Iran', 'little', 'gem', ""'Kingdom"", 'Heaven', 'delightful', 'Combining', 'celebrated', 'innocence', 'childhood', 'story', 'shares', 'culture', 'film', ""n't"", 'miss', 'when', 'nine-year-old', 'boy', 'Ali', 'sister', 'Zahra', 'picked', 'up', 'cobbler', 'when', 'market', 'pick', 'up', 'groceries', 'Watching', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'take', 'granted', 'affluent', 'West.We', 'begin', 'film', 'neighbors', 'arguing', 'water', 'use', 'showering', 'washing', 'clothes', 'Knowing', 'going', 'get', 'father', 'who', 'five', 'months', 'rent', 'Ali', 'everything', 'conceivable', 'conceal', 'loss', 'Daily', 'Ali', 'Zhaki', 'exchange', 'sneakers', 'sandals', 'race', 'time', 'sprint', 'school', 'session', 'running', 'Ali', 'trouble', 'principal', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tolerate', 'tardy', 'students', 'also', 'opportunity', 'chance', 'enter', 'race', 'where', 'third', 'prize', 'pair', 'new', 'sneakers.Deceptively', 'simple', 'plot', 'character', 'story', 'development', 'are', 'special', 'enough', 'create', 'magnetic', 'interest', 'beautiful', 'sequences', 'are', 'touching', 'brilliant', 'simplicity', ""'Children"", 'Heaven', 'joyful', 'effervescence', 'childhood', 'special', 'import']",N/A

It is about a brother and sister, and it is through the eyes.Ali, a young Iranian boy lives in a poor community with his young sister, a baby sister and their parents, who haven't paid the rent in 5 months.  Ali is berated and shamed by his father for lack of responsibility and work.  When Ali accidently loses his sister Zahra's shoes, he conspires with Zahra to cover up for fear of a beating from his dad.Reluctant to wear her brother's dirty, ill-fitting shoes, she goes along with the scheme knowing how much it meant to her brother to make the plan work.  A good student, Ali is often late for school as he waits for his sister to get out exactly on time and she races over to him for his class time.  Something invariably triggers a delay.Ali gets his turn to shine with his father.  The father takes Ali on a bicycle trip to the exclusive area  with rolling hills, lush greenery and gated entrances with intercoms.  Father promises to teach his son employment techniques but the father doesn't quite know how to approach the possible employers by ringing bells and speaking through intercoms.  Ali gets his due respect from his father when he ""speaks"" for him and they land some work.With determination, Ali and Zahra conspire til Ali begs his teacher to allow him to register for the big 4K race so he can come in third place to win a pair of shoes for his sister.The movie ends abruptly, but that allows us to further our imagination into their youthful world.....Rizzo",5,Innocence of youth,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,1608,"['wonderful', 'tale', 'heartwarming', 'loving', 'siblings', 'who', 'have', 'cultural', 'respect', 'responsibility', 'determination', 'inspiration', 'brother', 'sister', 'eyes.Ali', 'young', 'Iranian', 'boy', 'lives', 'poor', 'community', 'young', 'sister', 'baby', 'sister', 'parents', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'paid', 'rent', '5', 'months', 'Ali', 'berated', 'shamed', 'father', 'lack', 'responsibility', 'work', 'When', 'Ali', 'accidently', 'sister', 'Zahra', 'shoes', 'Zahra', 'cover', 'up', 'fear', 'beating', 'dad.Reluctant', 'wear', 'brother', 'dirty', 'ill-fitting', 'shoes', 'along', 'scheme', 'knowing', 'how', 'much', 'meant', 'brother', 'make', 'plan', 'work', 'good', 'student', 'Ali', 'often', 'late', 'school', 'sister', 'get', 'out', 'exactly', 'time', 'class', 'time', 'Something', 'invariably', 'delay.Ali', 'turn', 'shine', 'father', 'father', 'Ali', 'bicycle', 'trip', 'exclusive', 'area', 'rolling', 'hills', 'lush', 'greenery', 'gated', 'entrances', 'intercoms', 'Father', 'teach', 'son', 'employment', 'techniques', 'father', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'approach', 'possible', 'employers', 'ringing', 'bells', 'speaking', 'intercoms', 'Ali', 'due', 'respect', 'father', 'when', 'speaks', 'land', 'work.With', 'determination', 'Ali', 'Zahra', 'conspire', 'til', 'Ali', 'teacher', 'allow', 'register', 'big', '4K', 'race', 'can', 'come', 'third', 'place', 'win', 'pair', 'shoes', 'sister.The', 'movie', 'abruptly', 'further', 'imagination', 'youthful', 'world', '..Rizzo']",N/A

I knew it was ""art house"" fodder, which is usually okay with me.  I understood that it was supposed to communicate on an almost subliminal level, like The Red Balloon or Samuel Beckett's masterpiece starring Buster Keaton, simply called Film.But there was one more reason still.  I spent a considerable amount of time in Iran and can say without question that it is the most God-forsaken, thoroughly wretched place I've ever encountered in all my travels.  Worse still, it's been so demonized in the mind of Western culture that it has come to be little more than a symbol, we don't even think of it as a country at all.  I hoped that this film would show Iran as a nation of people who are, in essence, no different than other people - albeit without furniture.  No such luck.Were it not for the innate charm and beauty of the brother and sister leads, this film would be indistinguishable from a protracted Nike commercial consisting of Iranian children running down dry alleyways.  The plot, if one may dignify the action with such a lofty term, is barely large enough to fit on the head of a pin.  The action, once again, a misnomer, consists of going to and from school.  Oh boy.  The much-lauded relationships with parents and others are not strong enough to withstand a sneeze.The climatic finish, completely contrived, painfully obvious, and wheezing from overuse, manages to generate about as much excitement as the final minutes of a chess match.  Gosh, I wonder who will win the race?There are those who would say that such minimalism is realism, but they are deceived by the foreignness of the culture.

466523,A3C00N4UHA5XYX,6305492115,alooknac,"[1, 3]","I expected more from this film. It just leaves you hanging after fairly scanty plot and character development.I have no problem with those who love this movie, I just want to present another viewpoint. There are so many similarities to all the good reviews (that I only noticed in hindsight) that I think there was some kind of writing campaign to write good reviews for this ""family friendly film.""I enjoy foreign films and films set in other countries. I have also traveled widely and off the beaten path. I didn't learn anything new culturally from this movie and it just didn't cut it for entertainment, even touching feel-good entertainment, which is a genre I enjoy!Here is my feedback on what some other reviewers have said:* Free of violence, nudity, etc.- Yes but that can't be the only reason to rate a film highly, it still needs other qualities.* Portrays Iran favorably, good for international relations, shows that Iranians are just like us, etc.- Huh?? Showing me a school headmaster ominously slapping a baton in his hand is good PR for Iran? Schools where none of the adults care about the children beyond whether they have done their work? Children afraid of a beating from their father because of an accidental loss? Parents who only boss their children around? The one tender scene between parent and child stood out exactly because it was the only display of affection between parent and child in the whole movie.* The children ""share in each other's suffering and selflessly seek the best for the other.""- Umm, the sister constantly lays guilt trips on the brother and the brother constantly berates the girl for not getting to their change-of-shoes meeting place quicker even though she runs the whole way.* The children ""do not fight with one another, and accept what is with absolute purity of spirit. They live in a home without rancor, although it is poor.""- I guess this reviewer stepped out tof the room during all the scenes where the children fight with each other, the father berates the mother for not following his instructions (involving keeping her mouth shut), and the father chews out the son for just eating, sleeping, and playing, instead of being a hard worker like the father was at his age.* This movie will change your life forever- Only if you have lived a very sheltered life and never thought about how others live! If this movie opens your eyes, that's great, but I am shocked that this is all new to so many people. And if you think that level of poverty doesn't exist in the U.S., think again! And I don't know about Iran, but in some countries young children are living in garbage dumps.Finally, besides the lame ending, there were other parts of the film that left me hanging.The father gets well paid for a gardening job in a rich suburb and on the way home he is planning all he's going to do and buy with all that money, and presumably more money that he will earn that way. Then he crashed on his bike and that seems to be the end of it all. ????? The bike does get fixed because we see it later in the film.When Ali wins the race, instead of being happy, he is utterly dejected. None of the adults questions him about it. There is quite a long sequence of photographs being taken of him with his coach and headmaster and then alone (the photographer has to repeatedly tell him to look up). No one asks about his sadness. Seems unrealistic to me unless the message is supposed to be that Iranian adults don't care about children's feelings.So he didn't win third prize, which he wanted. Maybe the third prize winner would be willing to trade with him! Maybe if the adults asked why he was so sad, they would volunteer to buy the sister new shoes, either gratis, or in exchange for whatever first prize was (I can't remember first prize. Second prize was school supplies. Each prize was a stint at a camp plus shoes, supplies, or ?). Maybe he could give up his camp stay and get a pair of shoes instead.Probably if the movie had a decent ending I wouldn't have ended up feeling so negatively about it. It didn't leave me feeling moved and heart-warmed, it left me frustrated and disappointed. Mind you, I HAVE watched and appreciated the occasional movie that doesn't come to a neat and tidy ending. But it has to be done just right and I don't think Children of Heaven gets it right.",3,So So,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,4339,"['expected', 'more', 'film', 'just', 'hanging', 'fairly', 'scanty', 'plot', 'character', 'development.I', 'have', 'problem', 'who', 'love', 'movie', 'just', 'want', 'present', 'viewpoint', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'similarities', 'good', 'reviews', 'only', 'noticed', 'hindsight', 'think', 'was', 'kind', 'writing', 'campaign', 'write', 'good', 'reviews', 'family', 'friendly', 'film', 'enjoy', 'foreign', 'films', 'films', 'set', 'other', 'countries', 'have', 'also', 'traveled', 'widely', 'beaten', 'path', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'anything', 'new', 'culturally', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'entertainment', 'even', 'touching', 'feel-good', 'entertainment', 'genre', 'enjoy', 'Here', 'feedback', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', '*', 'Free', 'violence', 'nudity', 'etc.-', 'Yes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'reason', 'rate', 'film', 'highly', 'still', 'other', 'qualities', '*', 'Portrays', 'Iran', 'favorably', 'good', 'international', 'relations', 'Iranians', 'are', 'just', 'etc.-', 'Huh', 'Showing', 'school', 'headmaster', 'ominously', 'slapping', 'baton', 'hand', 'good', 'PR', 'Iran', 'Schools', 'where', 'none', 'adults', 'care', 'children', 'have', 'done', 'work', 'Children', 'afraid', 'beating', 'father', 'accidental', 'loss', 'Parents', 'who', 'only', 'boss', 'children', 'one', 'tender', 'scene', 'parent', 'child', 'stood', 'out', 'exactly', 'was', 'only', 'display', 'affection', 'parent', 'child', 'whole', 'movie', '*', 'children', 'share', 'other', 'suffering', 'selflessly', 'seek', 'best', 'other', 'Umm', 'sister', 'constantly', 'guilt', 'trips', 'brother', 'brother', 'constantly', 'girl', 'not', 'getting', 'change-of-shoes', 'meeting', 'place', 'quicker', 'even', 'whole', 'way', '*', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'fight', 'one', 'accept', 'what', 'absolute', 'purity', 'spirit', 'live', 'home', 'rancor', 'poor', 'guess', 'reviewer', 'stepped', 'out', 'room', 'scenes', 'where', 'children', 'fight', 'other', 'father', 'mother', 'not', 'following', 'instructions', 'involving', 'keeping', 'mouth', 'shut', 'father', 'out', 'son', 'just', 'eating', 'sleeping', 'playing', 'instead', 'being', 'hard', 'worker', 'father', 'was', 'age', '*', 'movie', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'forever-', 'Only', 'have', 'lived', 'very', 'sheltered', 'life', 'never', 'thought', 'how', 'others', 'live', 'movie', 'eyes', 'great', 'am', 'shocked', 'new', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'level', 'poverty', ""n't"", 'exist', 'U.S.', 'think', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Iran', 'countries', 'young', 'children', 'are', 'living', 'garbage', 'dumps.Finally', 'lame', 'ending', 'were', 'other', 'parts', 'film', 'left', 'hanging.The', 'father', 'well', 'paid', 'gardening', 'job', 'rich', 'suburb', 'way', 'home', 'planning', 'going', 'do', 'buy', 'money', 'presumably', 'more', 'money', 'will', 'earn', 'way', 'Then', 'crashed', 'bike', 'be', 'end', 'bike', 'get', 'fixed', 'see', 'later', 'film.When', 'Ali', 'race', 'instead', 'being', 'happy', 'utterly', 'dejected', 'None', 'adults', 'questions', 'quite', 'long', 'sequence', 'photographs', 'being', 'taken', 'coach', 'headmaster', 'then', 'alone', 'photographer', 'repeatedly', 'tell', 'look', 'up', 'one', 'sadness', 'unrealistic', 'message', 'supposed', 'be', 'Iranian', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'children', 'feelings.So', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'third', 'prize', 'wanted', 'Maybe', 'third', 'prize', 'winner', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'trade', 'Maybe', 'adults', 'asked', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'would', 'volunteer', 'buy', 'sister', 'new', 'shoes', 'gratis', 'exchange', 'first', 'prize', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'first', 'prize', 'Second', 'prize', 'was', 'school', 'supplies', 'prize', 'was', 'stint', 'camp', 'shoes', 'supplies', 'Maybe', 'could', 'give', 'up', 'camp', 'stay', 'get', 'pair', 'shoes', 'instead.Probably', 'movie', 'had', 'decent', 'ending', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'feeling', 'so', 'negatively', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'feeling', 'moved', 'heart-warmed', 'left', 'frustrated', 'disappointed', 'Mind', 'HAVE', 'watched', 'appreciated', 'occasional', 'movie', ""n't"", 'come', 'neat', 'tidy', 'ending', 'be', 'done', 'just', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Children', 'Heaven', 'right']",N/A

466527,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,6305492115,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","Writer/Director Majid Majidi's ""Children of Heaven"" is a small-budget wonder.  It's a stirring depiction of brother/sister love and sacrifice amidst dire economic circumstances.  Majidi coaxes brilliant performances out of young actors Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi.  Through an unfortunate sequence of events, brother and sister are forced to share a single pair of shoes.  Majidi's camera faithfully tracks the effort involved in pulling off such a scheme - you can feel the mounting exhaustion as brother Ali sprints from locale to locale trying to keep both of them in footwear and prevent news of his unfortunate loss (his sister's shoes were 'lost' while he was carrying them home from the cobbler) from reaching his parents.The crowning achievement of the movie lies in its stirring rendition of the race that Ali enters.  He aims to come in third - 3rd place wins a pair of sneakers.  Thing is, with all this running to and fro, Ali has become quite fit and quite the runner, shoddy footwear and all.  I think you can guess what happens - he 'fails' through triumph.  Here's the thing though - Majidi has staged an incredible race.  This is what a real run feels like.

466528,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,6305492115,Armando N. Roman,"[4, 4]","Children of Heaven is one of those movies that you just have to see for yourself instead of watching it based on reviews. A story about a poor Iranian family and the trouble a lost pair of shoes causes for two kids can create all kinds of weird images in one's head. Even the movie's box has this kind of important look to it. I first saw Children of Heaven about 5 years ago and absolutely fell in love with it. The story is cute and never gets dark, though I always worried about what might happen to the kids if the shoes never came back or got replaced. The two child stars, Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi, have fantastic chemistry and show their emotions very convincingly. There aren't very many other child actors I can think of that can do a better job than these two, and it's a shame that they haven't appeared in any other movies. Basically, if you want a lighthearted movie to watch, Children of Heaven is what you're looking for. It almost makes me wish I worked in a movie store again just so I could recommend it to people.Ali is a young Iranian boy who, after picking up his sister's shoes from being repaired, accidentally leaves them outside a market where a man takes them away since they were tucked in with bags and other junk. Ali is immediately devastated upon finding out that the shoes are gone, and he has no idea what to do. That was his sister's only pair- she had those shoes, and just has a pair of slipper left. Fearing that their father will beat both of them for this, Ali comes up with a temporary solution: Zahra will wear Ali's shoes to school, and when she's done, she'll give them back to him so he can wear them to his school. It's a kind of shoe relay race, as being on time is very important. Ali is an excellent student, and is rewarded for doing a good job in class, but if he's caught being late, he'll be sent home...to an angry father. As time goes on, a few of the kids in school will be picked to take place in a big race where the 3rd place winner gets a new pair of shoes. He's no athlete, but all this running has helped Ali out. Can he come in 3rd and win the shoes?The first thing I love about this movie is the look on Ali's face whenever something bad happened. I know, it sounds weird, but the look on his face is totally believable and you can't help but want to give the kid a hug or something. If I didn't know any better, I'd have guessed that someone off-camera was threatening to beat him if he didn't look worried enough. It might sound like Ali's father is abusive based on my mini summary, when it's really just a big concern of the kids. Their parents are like any other parents, and want what's best for their kids. The father raises his voice a lot, though as the movie goes on, we see just how down the family is when it comes to money. They can't afford to replace Zahra's shoes right away, so it's important that they never find out what happened. The guy's working hard to make ends meet, even riding out to a rich neighborhood on his bike, seeing if anyone needs his services as a gardener. And if you notice, Ali wears the same outfit for 90% of the movie, which seems to take place over the course of a week or so. The family is also behind 5 months on their rent AND has a tab at the market.Also in the movie is one of those things that drove me crazy when I'd see it as a kid- how the thing a character is looking for would always be just right under their nose. We see the man that took Zahra's shoes several times at the same location as Ali and her. If only Ali had seen him while he was in the market! Zahra manages to find the new owner of the shoes, and there are a couple of cute scenes with the targeted girl. The race at the end is also filled with emotion. Ali knows that the first and second prizes are better, yet that's not what he wants or needs. All that matters is the shoes for his sister.There's nothing bad I can say about this movie, though there are a few things I need to mention. My one nitpick is the use of music. There's barely any music in the movie, and when it does start to play, it seems a little cheap and forced. The music itself isn't bad, I just feel the scenes would've been fine without it. Also, the US dvd, for whatever reason, is missing the epilogue. While not necessary, it ends the movie on an even nicer note, finding out the future about one of the characters. The last thing is very minor but it may go over the heads of some viewers. In Iran, goldfish represent good luck. Just keep that in mind.Do yourself a favor and watch the movie without seeing any previews or clips beforehand. And if you like this, be sure to watch The Color of Paradise, also by the same director.",5,"Simple and sweet, perfect for all ages.",1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,4708,"['Children', 'Heaven', 'one', 'movies', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'instead', 'watching', 'based', 'reviews', 'story', 'poor', 'Iranian', 'family', 'trouble', 'lost', 'pair', 'shoes', 'causes', 'two', 'kids', 'can', 'create', 'kinds', 'weird', 'images', 'one', 'head', 'Even', 'movie', 'box', 'kind', 'important', 'look', 'first', 'saw', 'Children', 'Heaven', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'absolutely', 'fell', 'love', 'story', 'cute', 'never', 'dark', 'always', 'worried', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'kids', 'shoes', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'got', 'replaced', 'two', 'child', 'stars', 'Amir', 'Farrokh', 'Hashemian', 'Bahare', 'Seddiqi', 'have', 'fantastic', 'chemistry', 'show', 'emotions', 'very', 'convincingly', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'many', 'other', 'child', 'actors', 'can', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'two', 'shame', 'have', ""n't"", 'appeared', 'other', 'movies', 'Basically', 'want', 'lighthearted', 'movie', 'watch', 'Children', 'Heaven', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'almost', 'wish', 'worked', 'movie', 'store', 'again', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'recommend', 'people.Ali', 'young', 'Iranian', 'boy', 'who', 'picking', 'up', 'sister', 'shoes', 'being', 'repaired', 'accidentally', 'market', 'where', 'man', 'away', 'were', 'tucked', 'bags', 'other', 'junk', 'Ali', 'immediately', 'devastated', 'finding', 'out', 'shoes', 'are', 'gone', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'was', 'sister', 'only', 'pair-', 'had', 'shoes', 'just', 'pair', 'slipper', 'left', 'Fearing', 'father', 'will', 'beat', 'Ali', 'up', 'temporary', 'solution', 'Zahra', 'will', 'wear', 'Ali', 'shoes', 'school', 'when', 'done', ""'ll"", 'give', 'back', 'so', 'can', 'wear', 'school', 'kind', 'shoe', 'relay', 'race', 'being', 'time', 'very', 'important', 'Ali', 'excellent', 'student', 'rewarded', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'class', 'caught', 'being', 'late', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sent', 'home', 'angry', 'father', 'time', 'few', 'kids', 'school', 'will', 'be', 'picked', 'take', 'place', 'big', 'race', 'where', '3rd', 'place', 'winner', 'new', 'pair', 'shoes', 'athlete', 'running', 'helped', 'Ali', 'Can', 'come', '3rd', 'win', 'shoes', 'first', 'thing', 'love', 'movie', 'look', 'Ali', 'face', 'whenever', 'something', 'bad', 'happened', 'know', 'weird', 'look', 'face', 'totally', 'believable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'want', 'give', 'kid', 'hug', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', ""'d"", 'have', 'guessed', 'someone', 'off-camera', 'was', 'threatening', 'beat', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'worried', 'enough', 'might', 'sound', 'Ali', 'father', 'abusive', 'based', 'mini', 'summary', 'when', 'really', 'just', 'big', 'concern', 'kids', 'parents', 'are', 'other', 'parents', 'want', 'what', 'best', 'kids', 'father', 'voice', 'lot', 'movie', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'down', 'family', 'when', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'replace', 'Zahra', 'shoes', 'right', 'away', 'important', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'guy', 'working', 'hard', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'even', 'riding', 'out', 'rich', 'neighborhood', 'bike', 'seeing', 'anyone', 'services', 'gardener', 'notice', 'Ali', 'same', 'outfit', '90', '%', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'course', 'week', 'so', 'family', 'also', '5', 'months', 'rent', 'AND', 'tab', 'market.Also', 'movie', 'one', 'things', 'drove', 'crazy', 'when', ""'d"", 'see', 'kid-', 'how', 'thing', 'character', 'looking', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'just', 'right', 'nose', 'see', 'man', 'took', 'Zahra', 'shoes', 'several', 'times', 'same', 'location', 'Ali', 'only', 'Ali', 'had', 'seen', 'was', 'market', 'Zahra', 'find', 'new', 'owner', 'shoes', 'are', 'couple', 'cute', 'scenes', 'targeted', 'girl', 'race', 'end', 'also', 'filled', 'emotion', 'Ali', 'first', 'second', 'prizes', 'are', 'better', 'not', 'what', 'needs', 'matters', 'shoes', 'sister.There', 'nothing', 'bad', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'need', 'mention', 'one', 'nitpick', 'use', 'music', 'barely', 'music', 'movie', 'when', 'start', 'play', 'little', 'cheap', 'forced', 'music', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'feel', 'scenes', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fine', 'Also', 'US', 'dvd', 'reason', 'missing', 'epilogue', 'not', 'necessary', 'movie', 'even', 'nicer', 'note', 'finding', 'out', 'future', 'one', 'characters', 'last', 'thing', 'very', 'minor', 'may', 'go', 'heads', 'viewers', 'Iran', 'goldfish', 'represent', 'good', 'luck', 'Just', 'keep', 'mind.Do', 'favor', 'watch', 'movie', 'seeing', 'previews', 'clips', 'beforehand', 'like', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'Color', 'Paradise', 'also', 'same', 'director']",N/A

To call it a feel-good movie does very little justice to it because it is so much more than that.  It's a story of selflessness that's doubly admirable for it is shown by those who have so little to begin with.  Having viewed a couple of Iranian director Majid Majidi's films (Baran, The Color of Paradise), I have become a fan of this extremely talented auteur.The story centers on a young brother and his little sister, Ali and Zahra in Tehran.  Ali takes Zahra's shoes for repair, the one and only pair she owns and wears to school.  Ali becomes distracted on his way to the shoemaker and loses the shoes.  Keeping the loss secret from their poor parents, the two decide to share Ali's sneakers, each taking turns wearing them to school.  Zahra wears them in the morning and when classes are over, gives them to Ali so he can wear them to school in the afternoons.  The exchanges are so comic and touching at the same time that you can't help but root for these kids.  Soon after, Ali discovers there's a foot race his teacher is encouraging him to join, and the third-place prize is a brand new pair of sneakers!  If only Ali can ensure he wins third place so he can replace Zahra's lost shoes!  I'll stop right here and let you discover the rest of this wondrous story.What is striking about this film is its realism.  Never once did I feel I was watching actors on a staged set.  These are real people in real places, speaking and interacting as real people do everyday.  Nothing here is dramatized for effect.  From the mundane events of everyday living to the sadness borne of mistakes, everything is genuine and palpable.  It is not an art house film, but is no less artful or profound.  Its simplicity is deceptive because it doesn't prepare you for the wallop of emotions you experience when it's over.  And that ending...it was a perfect closing to a perfect story.  Living in a country where we have so much that disposal of possessions becomes an issue, it is a timeless film that reminds us of what's truly important in life.  Don't let the subtitles deter you; I encourage you to watch it, especially if you have young children to watch it with.

I found them endearing and easily watchable. And the filming is topnotch, too. The camera angles, the use of light and dark, the underwater guppies, etc. were all handled as if by a professional Hollywood studio (not a low-budget Iranian film).It was also nice to be immersed in Iranian culture. The differences between American and Iranian schools, American and Iranian marketplaces, and American and Iranian architecture was startling.Where this movie was SERIOUSLY lacking was in the script. And mainly in its ending. There are no resolutions, even though I felt there surely would've been. Ali doesn't win 3rd place in the running competition, but he does win. But there's no mention of what he might have done with those winnings.And there's a scene toward the end of the film where it appears Zahra's father may have bought her some shoes (perhaps the very ones Ali lost), but nothing about this is brought to fruition.Perhaps it's a nihilistic interpretation of the way Iranian culture is.

Happily, the suffering these beautiful children have to endure is not terrible; it is only the loss of a pair of shoes.  Children should never have to suffer anything worse than this.

At first glance the story may seem slight and superficial: a boy from a very poor family loses his sister's only pair of sneakers and endeavours to replace them without having to place an additional financial burden on his hard working father.  But even with that simple premise director Majid Majidi manages to bring so much depth and humanity to the story that you will almost want to go to your nearest cineplex and throw rocks at the marquee.Majidi's choice of child actors in this film is a very good one.  Their innocent faces register such a range of emotions over the course of the film I began to think that many adult actors should be watching this film and taking notes.  Majidi's depiction of life in the poverty stricken areas of modern Tehran is also very well done and later in the film when father and son venture into the wealthy sections of the city the gulf between the haves and the have nots becomes all too apparent.  But its in the simplest things that this film shows so much of its heart and reveals to us its larger truths: Ali trying to make amends to his sister by giving her a pen he has won at school, brother and sister having to share a pair of sneakers until Ali can find a way to replace the lost ones, the elation of the father at having found a new lucrative line of work as a gardener for the rich, the kids blowing bubbles as they wash the only pair of sneakers they own and so on.  What really impressed me was the fact that Majidi can render these moments with such sublime humanity that he does so without being overly sentimental about it.  Few Hollywood directors could do this without having to laden those scenes with tooth decaying sugary sweetness.All in all this is a movie that can be enjoyed by just about anyone who cares for really good film making .  And for those folks who are always complaining about the lack of films that depict ""family values"" you need look no further than ""Children of Heaven"".

In CHILDREN OF HEAVEN he has written and directed a story so delicate and so genuinely human that it has few peers as a piece of filmmaking.  He is able to see, and allow us to see, the world through the eyes of children.  And as if that weren't enough, he has chosen the filial relationship between a brother and a sister that demonstrates just how profound love can be.  Ali and Zahra are youngsters who maintain their family duties (living in a poverty section outside the city), serving their ill mother and overworked father and their infant sibling while continuing their education in their separate schools.  The family is so poor that each member has only one pair of shoes and when Ali inadvertently loses Zahra's newly 'repaired' old shoes, he makes a pact with her that the two will share Ali's sneakers to spare the grief that the father would feel should he discover the truth - that no further shoes were affordable for Zahra.  The two swallow pride, make sacrifices, and depend on each other as the one pair of old sneakers plays double duty.  Each child attends a unisex school and these microcosms afford the study of the interplay of the two children as a metaphor for Iran society. Ultimately Ali finds a solution to gain a new pair of shoes for his sister by attempting to place THIRD in a long distance running race.  The way that race plays out offers a somewhat surprise ending.  This story is simple on the surface,  but the insights into the poverty of Iran against the wealth in the major cities, the ability for a family to not only survive but make a family relationship so dear - these are the portions of magic that make this beautiful movie an experience that will please almost every viewer.

466544,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6305492115,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 2]","This film has been compared to a number of other foreign films of the heartwarming variety (&quot;Kolya,&quot; &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot;).  Like those films, &quot;Children of Heaven&quot; features children in pivotal roles, and as in those films, the child actors seem remarkably unaffected and natural.  This Iranian film, however, is perhaps even more &quot;childlike&quot; in its worldview.  For that reason, despite the overall acclaim the film has garnered, there have been a number of critics who found it too treacly, too sentimental.  As I recall, both Siskel and Ebert were thumbs down on this one for those very reasons.Well, I try to be as jaded as the next guy, but the sweetness of this film didn't particularly bother me.  Keep in mind that the story is told primarily from the point of view of the children.  Unlike, say, &quot;Kolya&quot; which is about how an adult is changed by the presence of a child in his life, this is a film which focuses primarily the hopes and fears of its child protagonists.  It's hard for adults to recall how bewildering the world can be for a small child trying to make sense of it.  Children learn quickly that they can get into trouble--even when they are not at fault--when adults are too stressed, emotionally or financially, to really listen.  They learn too that other adults (teachers and other authority figures) may be impossible to confide in, since they may not even begin to understand and because the need to keep family secrets secret is impressed on the youngsters so early.These &quot;Children of Heaven&quot; seem thwarted at every turn.  Every time things look like they'll go right for them, fate takes an ironic twist.  At times, it's almost too frustrating to see these tykes face yet another setback, but somehow they seem to muddle on...and maybe that's the lesson they--and we--need to learn.

466550,A246DPGDMYPQ0K,6305492115,J. Ocampo,"[0, 0]","If there's something to be said about foreign films, it is that they convey a different viewing experience.  The actors, directors, writers, and producers have different value systems, a different sense of humor, and thematic material that we rarely get in American movies.Don't get me wrong, I love American cinema, but it doesn't hurt to see something a little different from time to time.  That's where Children of Heaven comes in.Zohre is a young Iranian school girl who has a pair of old, pink shoes.  Her brother Ali picks them up from a shoe repairman.  But due to an unfortunate turn of events, the shoes are lost.  Now Zohre has no shoes to wear when she goes to school and the childrens' father does not have enough money to buy her a new pair.  The children do not want to worry and embarrass him by asking him to buy a new pair, and they do not want to be punished, so they use the same pair of shoes.Getting to school becomes a dramatic ordeal, as the two children start class at different times and have to race back and forth so that both of them may arrive at school with shoes on their feet.There are interesting events that take place in school, there are well done interactions between the two children and their parents, and the movie remains interesting throughout.Some people might be a little impatient with what is commonly referred to as ""chick flicks.""  And these same people might enjoy action a lot more than conversation and find overly emotional, melodramatic romance intolerable.Still, I think even these people will really enjoy this movie.  There's no violence, but the movie develops in such an artful manner, that the viewer becomes genuinely concerned with the plight of the brother and the sister who share a single pair of shoes.Some reviewers have disparaged the movie as being about boring subject matter.  However, sometimes the kind of struggle that regular people have to go through can be more meaningful than the monstrous battles and other epic events we see in most movies.As an American that has no first hand experience with the middle east or middle eastern culture, I enjoyed seeing the humanity of Iranian children and the interactions between husband and wife that are too often portrayed in a stereotypical, and probably somewhat unrealistic light, by the American media.I recommend this movie as a welcome change (even if the change is only temporary) from what we usually see with American cinema.

Zahra refused to wear hers out of pride, as she wasn't the one who lost the shoes.  Are sandals not allowed in his school?2.  Why didn't Ali come closer to Zahara's school to exchange shoes at midday?3.  Why didn't Ali explain the situation to his teacher, who seemed an understanding, decent sort?4.  How did Ali's parents not know that their son was in the big race?5.  Why couldn't Ali sell the first place prize and use the money to buy sneakers?All of these questions could have been answered pretty easily and would have helped create more depth to the characters and tension to the story.

It's about a 9-year old boy who loses his 7-year old sister's shoes through no fault of his own.  They are very poor and they both want to keep it a secret from their parents.  And so they share his only pair of worn-out sneakers.  She wears them to school in the morning, and then runs through the streets, gives him the shoes and he wears them in the afternoon.  Such a plan is not without its challenges, however.  She almost loses a shoe when it falls into a gutter.  He's late for school.  The shoes are worn.  Both of them crave a pair of their own.Amir Farrokh Hasherman is cast as the boy.  He has the biggest, most expressive eyes I've ever seen and my heart immediately went out to him.  Bahare Seddiqi is the little sister.  She wears a long dress and a white head covering just like all the other little girls.  It's their shoes that show their individuality and she is always looking at all the other little girl's feet.  One day she sees a little girl wearing her own lost shoes, but the other little girl is the daughter of a blind beggar.  Later, there is a footrace announced in the little boy's school.  He finds out that if he wins third prize he can get a new pair of sneakers.  The tension mounts.One of the best things about this film is that it brought me into another culture.  This is not about revolution and bombs and sadness.  This is just a simple story about the love between a brother and sister.  It transcends all cultures, and makes the audience see the humanity of the children. There's one scene where they clean the shoes and blow great big soap bubbles at each other.

Put it at the top of your list to see. Roger Ebert sums it up best:``Children of Heaven'' is very nearly a perfect movie for children, and of course that means adults will like it, too. It lacks the cynicism and smart-mouth attitudes of so much American entertainment for kids and glows with a kind of good-hearted purity.

Crammer,"[15, 16]","This Iranian film tells a simple story of a brother (Ali) and sister Zahra (he's 9, she's younger) who live in a particularly poor family -- the father serves tea for a living and the mother has been sick, which could explain why they're five months behind in the rent.  Ali takes his sister's shoes to be mended but loses them on the way home in a ""could happen to anyone"" accident.  They are his sister's only shoes and there's no money to buy more -- and they fear the father's wrath.  They end up sharing the boy's shoes -- which apparently works because the school building is shared by boys and girls but not at the same time.  Still, there's a lot of running involved in making the switch.What is striking is the integrity of everyone in this movie, despite their poverty.  A six-year-old finds a pen and returns it.  The father wouldn't think of taking something that wasn't his, however tiny.  And there's much kindness in this movie, showing that poverty doesn't need to make people greedy and cruel -- money seems to do that.I highly recommend this movie.

My parents who live outside the US still think America is a scary country, all because of the movies that Hollywood has created so far.Anyway, this movie is not a bigger-than-life movie, there is no violence, sex or crime, or destroyed relationship to get you excited.  Yet it is so powerful, it captures your mind throughout.  The director does a wonderful work in bringing forward the two children's inner hearts by delicate, subtle, simple ways.  The two child actors who played the roles of the boy and his sister were superb.  Their acting was not exaggerated, instead very natural and healthy.  By taking life as life as it is, and by keeping it that way, the movie ends unexpectedly simple and moving.  There is nothing dramatic to turn the misfortune into a happy ending, but you can see that there is a definite understanding between the two children.  They grow up so much as you watch.I particularly liked the scene where the little sister sees another girl wearing her lost shoes, but she does not confront her.  Later she secretly vists the girl's house with her brother.  There they see her come out, followed by her blind father.  They leave the house quietly without being noticed, and continue with their own struggle of life without the shoes.  The movie is full of compassion, gentleness, courage and thoughtfulness not only between the kids, but among the people, while being honest about the cruelty of poverty.My wonder is that why no adults bother to ask the boy what is wrong with him and his sister.  There is enough evidence that something is wrong.  Instead, the teachers scold the boy, the parents are absorbed with their own worries, while the boy and his sister are trying to take a full responsibility for the misfortune that fell upon them.  It is heart-breaking to see the boy unable to talk to his parents about what had happened.  I grew up in poverty also, but I would not have hidden it from my parents. They would have taken care of the problem for me.The ending was more than superb, truly a story of heaven.",5,excellent,1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,2220,"['Hollywood', 'can', 'forget', 'bigger-than-life', 'sex', 'violence', 'movies', 'start', 'creating', 'movies', 'such', 'one', 'world', 'view', 'America', 'would', 'improve', 'significantly', 'parents', 'who', 'live', 'US', 'still', 'think', 'America', 'scary', 'country', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'created', 'so', 'far.Anyway', 'movie', 'not', 'bigger-than-life', 'movie', 'violence', 'sex', 'crime', 'destroyed', 'relationship', 'get', 'excited', 'so', 'powerful', 'mind', 'director', 'wonderful', 'work', 'bringing', 'forward', 'two', 'children', 'inner', 'hearts', 'delicate', 'subtle', 'simple', 'ways', 'two', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'roles', 'boy', 'sister', 'were', 'superb', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'exaggerated', 'instead', 'very', 'natural', 'healthy', 'taking', 'life', 'as', 'life', 'keeping', 'way', 'movie', 'unexpectedly', 'simple', 'moving', 'nothing', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'misfortune', 'happy', 'ending', 'can', 'see', 'definite', 'understanding', 'two', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'watch.I', 'particularly', 'liked', 'scene', 'where', 'little', 'sister', 'girl', 'wearing', 'lost', 'shoes', 'not', 'confront', 'Later', 'secretly', 'girl', 'house', 'brother', 'see', 'come', 'out', 'followed', 'blind', 'father', 'leave', 'house', 'quietly', 'being', 'noticed', 'continue', 'own', 'struggle', 'life', 'shoes', 'movie', 'full', 'compassion', 'gentleness', 'courage', 'thoughtfulness', 'not', 'only', 'kids', 'people', 'being', 'honest', 'cruelty', 'poverty.My', 'wonder', 'why', 'adults', 'bother', 'ask', 'boy', 'what', 'wrong', 'sister', 'enough', 'evidence', 'something', 'wrong', 'Instead', 'teachers', 'scold', 'boy', 'parents', 'are', 'absorbed', 'own', 'worries', 'boy', 'sister', 'are', 'trying', 'take', 'full', 'responsibility', 'misfortune', 'fell', 'heart-breaking', 'see', 'boy', 'unable', 'talk', 'parents', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'grew', 'up', 'poverty', 'also', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'hidden', 'parents', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'care', 'problem', 'me.The', 'ending', 'was', 'more', 'superb', 'truly', 'story', 'heaven']",N/A

I've used that status as a guide for finding good unknown foreign movies and have come across some enjoyable ones that way.  ""The Children of Heaven"" is one of the better surprizes I had lately.  It starts out innocently enough...and stays that way.  Along the way we watch a pair of sibling elementary school children try to solve a problem on their own.  We realize that their problem is real but not overwhelming but they don't.  We watch as they work out temporary solutions while searching for a permanent one.  Along the way, we come to understand the mind of a an adolescent and we like what we see.  Eventually, the film reaches a climax and I couldn't help notice that I was standing in excitement for the last 5-10 minutes of the movie.

Zwick,"[56, 59]","The wonderful Iranian film, &quot;Children of Heaven,&quot; and its companion piece, &quot;The White Balloon&quot;, remind one of those great Czechoslovakian films of the 1960's (&quot;The Shop on Main Street&quot;  and &quot;Loves of a Blonde&quot; etc.) in that they achieve their artistry  by providing keenly observed glimpses into the minutiae of everyday life.  They also help to humanize a culture often regarded as alien and even  incomprehensible to western eyes. Above all, this magnificent film reminds  us that real drama comes not in the form of overplotted special effects  laden extravaganzas, but from films that examine the universal simplicities  of life as we all know it. When it is distilled through the eyes of a poet  - this is when art is achieved.&quot;Children of Heaven&quot; has its  roots planted firmly in the neorealist tradition. Its simple story echoes  not merely the earlier &quot;The White Balloon&quot; but the original  Italian classic, &quot;The Bicycle Thief.&quot; In this film, young Ali  accidentally loses his sister's recently mended shoes; out of this tale of  utmost simplicity, the filmmakers take us on a fascinating tour of life in  a typical Iranian village and family. As Ali and his sister scheme to  overcome this obstacle, the film touches on any number of universal themes:  the close ties of siblings united in their common bond of avoiding often  irrational parental anger; well meaning, loving parents overwhelmed with  the trials of everyday life who are often compelled to act out in ways that  seem cruel to the children who adore them; the petty viciousness with which  children often strike out at each other, yet, at the same time, the often  unexpectant kindness and empathy with which they also treat one another.  The film manages to keep the audience constantly engrossed in its action  without once resorting to even a smidgen of incredibility or melodrama.  Beautifully directed, with a superb soundtrack filled with heightened  naturalistic noises, it is a film of many-splendored wonders, its lyricism  caught in a glimpse of soap bubbles floating around a backyard produced by  two children abandoned to their moment of incomprehensible youthful joy,  its high drama found in a shoe racing down a city sewer with a desperate  young girl in tow.The actors, children and adults alike, underplay their  roles in so naturalistic a fashion that one does not even feel they are  performing at all; the film, through them, becomes a magical fabric of life  that draws the audience deep into its world.&quot;Children of  Heaven&quot; brilliantly demonstrates that works of art often arise from  the observation of the most seemingly mundane concerns of daily life and  reminds us that this provides far more drama than all the exploding  spaceships, car chases and hyperkinetic melodrama that flood the screen in  the guise of entertainment. It certainly shows just how phony, empty and  bereft of life most American films are. Don't miss &quot;Children of  Heaven&quot;!

Four years ago I taught English to six classes of high school sophomores and seniors in Laguna, a province three hours away from Manila. I invited my classes to watch this movie, and they did. This was some months after 9/11. A lot of the students have parents who work as cheap laborers and domestic help in the Middle East, including Iran. I thought they'd be curious to see it.They enjoyed it tremendously. They cheered when Ali won the race, were touched by the strong emotional bond between the brother and sister, and related to the travails of the poor Iranian family. I guess they were a little surprised that oil-rich Iran, a country where a lot of Filipinos work in order to send money back home, has poor people, too. The movie was a change from the First World perspective and escapism of the Hollywood movies they were used to. Islamic and relatively wealthy Iran created a movie that connected with a Christian audience from a poor country. The movie was close to home.Should you watch this movie? Yes. This tender and powerful movie counters the dehumanizing consequences of global conflict and world politics (usually dictated by isolated and narrow-minded men). Iran is often in news, monolithically depicted as this nuclear threat. In the face of such negative media representation, of ""axis of evil"" rhetorics, the inevitable Arabophobia after 9/11, it is easy to forget the humanity of the people who have no choice but to live in unpopular states, like in Iran.

466574,AQE41QO3NEUMW,6305492115,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[3, 3]","This is another deeply affecting story about simple people by Iranian director Magid Magidi. The central character is a schoolboy, Ali, from a poor Tehran family who loses the shoes of his younger sister, and loans his own sneakers to her so that she can go to her school in the mornings, swapping with him as he races off to his own school in the afternoons. This simple premise offers a window into the lives of  people who must scrape to get by, the mother recovering from an illness and the father working odd jobs. Meanwhile, the landlord wants five months' back rent and the grocer is refusing to extend credit.The situation may seem stereotypical on the surface - and a guaranteed tearjerker - but Magidi wrings such plausible performances from his cast that it's easy to be swept up in the immediacy of the problems facing them, and we watch as the problem of the lost shoes becomes a weight on the shoulders of the young Ali that is nearly impossible to bear. An episode that takes Ali and his father looking door-to-door for gardening jobs in a wealthy neighborhood sets their own limited means in stark contrast, but Magidi's humanely gentle vision treats even the rich with some sympathy. A footrace at the end of the film leads to an ironically triumphant scene that only Ali finds cause to lament.

This film would never see the light of day in Hollywood production studios. In fact, the film and story is extremely simple yet that is what makes it such a pleasant movie to watch. It's a story that could happen to anyone. A little boy from an extremely poor family is sent out to run errands. One of the errands is to take his little sisters pink slippers to the menders to have them sewn up (since they can't afford a new pair for her). While completing his last errand at the food market, a merchant accidentally picks up the pair of slippers while loading his cart with scrap paper. The little girl's slippers are gone forever. The children are faced with a dilemma now. The family can hardly afford to feed themselves no less pay for a new pair of shoes, and their father would be livid at the fact that the shoes were taken. What's a child to do? Go barefoot? Well, the children develop a cleaver plan to solve the problem. Though their plan works initially, it proves to be a bit tricky and laboring to fall through on a long term basis. The boy then takes drastic measures in getting his little sister a pair of shoes; motivated the whole time through his love for her.It's the little things that make this movie great. It has wonderful acting, a lot of feeling and warmth, and a message at the end that good things happen to good people after all. You can truly feel the love between the brother and sister. Though this family lives in the poorest conditions they're still happy. The children get the highest grades in their classes, and their values and morals are impeccable. Another thing I love about this film is it brought me into a whole different culture and world with different traditions and way of living that I know so very little of.There are a lot of spoilt children I wouldn't mind showing this film to. It shows children that you don't need a lot to still be a good person. Children in our culture concern themselves on whether or not they have the newest video game or the latest toy that's out.

466581,ANN4JW1E08AS6,6305492115,tuberacer,"[1, 1]","It's a good film. A new twist on the old race to the finish story. It has a peculiar ending image which may have more meaning to Iranians, I don't know. The movie's title is probably the biggest clue to its meaning. The unexpected quality of the ending has us reflect back on the story as a whole. There's an elusive motif, transcending age and culture, highlighted at the ending, about the fruitfulness and necessity of an individual's struggling, and perhaps how compassionate struggling and even suffering, is a form of divinity--sounds grandiose, I know, but you have to relate the innocence of the story with the movie's title. From what I've seen of his work, Majidi is a profound thinker dealing with the nature of divinity who seems to concentrate the depth of his thinking imagery into the ending of his movies, giving what seems like a simple story an unexpected leap into a higher understanding. The storyline build-up to that thinking ending is mostly plot driven and basic, good entertainment, and for us non-Iranians, a nice glimpse of another culture. This film of  his is mostly an all ages film, warm and lighthearted and compassionate, but it's also a film made in a highly religious society by a filmmaker who is obviously interested in the greater--even mystical--significance of life events, so I would suggest you not simply shrug the ending as a humorous conclusion. I believe it's saying a lot more.The father is an interesting portrait played by Mohammad Amir Naji (who played a large role in Majidi's other film, ""Baran""). He's a character who should elicit conflicting emotions from the viewer. The child actors are a pleasure to watch from beginning to end. There's a little social commentary about rich and poor, but hardly dwelt upon. It's basically just a little Arabian Nights' kind of story about a brother and sister and their shared pair of ragged sneakers with an almost parable-like ending. Goldfish seem to turn up a lot in Iranian films, suggesting that they have some kind of symbolic meaning in that culture. If true, knowing that symbolic meaning would be an important key to unlocking the full effect this movie is probably supposed to have. Again, I believe there's always some mystical element in Majidi's films, probably deriving from his Persian and Islamic mystical heritage.The one thing that I really, really wish about ""Children of Heaven"" is that there was a version dubbed in English so that my young daughter and her friends could watch it. That would make the most sense about marketing this movie to the English speaking world. They're completely missing the most important audience by not offering such a version. But, you know,someone in Hollywood will probably eventually just copy the story in a mega-bucks Americanized version and get credit for the originality of the story from the unknowing public instead.

But every aspect of this movie deserves praise.Its story is entertaining and subtle. Surprisingly even jaded people (like me) found it pleasing. Further, it contains some social-political criticism, the childrens' distrust of adults and their noble behavior make them a symbol of the oppressed. (My friend says it references the classic ""The Bicycle Thief"" in this regard.) Even if such symbolism isn't for you, the beauty and sweetness of the story is.The color and sound of this movie are first-rate. I expected foreign-film standards, but they are even better than most Hollywood movies. Even with a mediocre story, they would stand out.Another great aspect of the movie is its portrayal of life in Iran.
