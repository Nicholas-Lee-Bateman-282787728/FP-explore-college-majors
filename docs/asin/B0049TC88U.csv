I loved the parallel situation between the mom and daughter both meeting arch villians. Jamie Lee Curtis is hilarous, especially in the scene when she visits her enemy's hotel room and checks out her bathroom. She drops a piece of jewelry down the sink and trys to take the sink apart to retrieve it, instead becoming drenched and looking like a wet rat! Of course, like a lot of comedies, it gets a little crazy and unreal towards the end.

1390111,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0049TC88U,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I really didn't want to see this.  There is a never-ending trend in Hollywood to stuff pointless fluff with talented actors, saddling them with poorly managed scripts and plot points that go nowhere, essentially wasting their talent wholly to turn a dollar.  As a rule of thumb, if the film stars more than two `BIG NAMES' then it is probably terrible.  So, when you factor in that comedic goldmines Sigourney Weaver, Jamie Lee Curtis, Betty White, Kristen Chenoweth and Cloris Leachman are all starring alongside current `it-girl' Kristen Bell and reliable supporting man Victor Garber, one has to assume that this is going to be a train wreck.  Add to that the fact that this film is a PG rated slapstick comedy and you have my anticipation level plummeting to the floor.As could be expected, the critics hated this film.Here's the thing; the film isn't terrible.  In fact, until you get to the ridiculous ending, the film is actually pretty funny and fun.  Everyone involved steps up and makes the most of their outlandish characters and they all seem to have fun playing alongside one another, which plays to the strengths of the genre (likability).  You can't help but smile while watching these people fall all over themselves trying to outdo one another.  Some have balked at the behavior presented as childish and immature, but isn't that the point?  I mean, this isn't supposed to be entirely realistic but an exaggerated (as are all films within this genre) example of true feelings.  Rivalries spark and some never die and some rear their ugly heads over time without any real resolve.  Sure, not many people go to petty lengths to exact revenge, and things could have gone a lot smoother had everyone just say down and TALKED about things, but then the movie wouldn't have been as entertaining.For a quick overview; Marni was a geek in high school and was tormented by J.J., the warden `so-to-speak' of the school.  Marni is now all grown up, VERY successful and pretty hot herself.  She comes back home for her brother's wedding only to find out that he is marrying J.J., who claims to have never met Marni.  Marni tries to put things behind her, but she can't.  Marni's mother also has old feelings stirred when J.J.'s aunt turns out to be her ex-best friend from high school.Insert slapstick.The gags don't always work, but the actresses involved (especially Curtis and Weaver) keep things moving at a great pace.  They teeter on the schmaltzy at times, but they handle it with a certain finesse that I didn't expect.  It is in the final chapter, after `the cat is out of the bag' that the film falls to pieces; and quick.  All this bent up anger that the film had been building up is instantly let go of and replaced and a faux sense of resolve in an effort to make everything `happy' again.  The character of J.J. makes no sense because she appears so fake and skin deep throughout the whole film only to be forced upon us as sincere in the end (seriously, it doesn't work).  That is why I have to give this three stars instead of four.  I loved the first three quarters of the film, but it really took a sharp nosedive at the end.  I understand that Hollywood is obsessed with the happy ending, but this was just too much.Thank god the final scene was between Betty White and Cloris Leachman!",3,I consider watching you again...,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,3310,"['really', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'never-ending', 'trend', 'Hollywood', 'stuff', 'pointless', 'fluff', 'talented', 'actors', 'saddling', 'poorly', 'managed', 'scripts', 'plot', 'points', 'go', 'nowhere', 'essentially', 'wasting', 'talent', 'wholly', 'turn', 'dollar', 'rule', 'thumb', 'film', 'more', 'two', 'BIG', 'NAMES', 'then', 'probably', 'terrible', 'So', 'when', 'factor', 'comedic', 'goldmines', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Betty', 'White', 'Kristen', 'Chenoweth', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'are', 'starring', 'alongside', 'current', 'it-girl', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'reliable', 'supporting', 'man', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'one', 'assume', 'going', 'be', 'train', 'wreck', 'Add', 'fact', 'film', 'PG', 'rated', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'have', 'anticipation', 'level', 'plummeting', 'floor.As', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'critics', 'hated', 'film.Here', 'thing', 'film', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'fact', 'get', 'ridiculous', 'ending', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'fun', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'steps', 'up', 'most', 'outlandish', 'characters', 'seem', 'have', 'fun', 'playing', 'alongside', 'one', 'strengths', 'genre', 'likability', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'watching', 'people', 'fall', 'trying', 'outdo', 'one', 'have', 'balked', 'behavior', 'presented', 'childish', 'immature', ""n't"", 'point', 'mean', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'entirely', 'realistic', 'exaggerated', 'are', 'films', 'genre', 'example', 'true', 'feelings', 'Rivalries', 'spark', 'never', 'die', 'rear', 'ugly', 'heads', 'time', 'real', 'resolve', 'Sure', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'go', 'petty', 'lengths', 'exact', 'revenge', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'lot', 'smoother', 'had', 'everyone', 'just', 'say', 'down', 'TALKED', 'things', 'then', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'entertaining.For', 'quick', 'overview', 'Marni', 'was', 'geek', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'tormented', 'J.J.', 'warden', 'so-to-speak', ""'"", 'school', 'Marni', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'VERY', 'successful', 'pretty', 'hot', 'herself', 'back', 'home', 'brother', 'wedding', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'marrying', 'J.J.', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'Marni', 'Marni', 'put', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Marni', 'mother', 'also', 'old', 'feelings', 'stirred', 'when', 'J.J.', 'aunt', 'out', 'be', 'ex-best', 'friend', 'high', 'school.Insert', 'slapstick.The', 'gags', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'actresses', 'involved', 'especially', 'Curtis', 'Weaver', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'great', 'pace', 'teeter', 'schmaltzy', 'times', 'handle', 'certain', 'finesse', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'final', 'chapter', 'cat', 'bag', 'film', 'pieces', 'quick', 'bent', 'up', 'anger', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'building', 'up', 'instantly', 'let', 'go', 'replaced', 'faux', 'sense', 'resolve', 'effort', 'make', 'everything', 'happy', 'again', 'character', 'J.J.', 'sense', 'so', 'fake', 'skin', 'deep', 'whole', 'film', 'only', 'be', 'forced', 'upon', 'sincere', 'end', 'seriously', ""n't"", 'work', 'why', 'have', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'instead', 'four', 'loved', 'first', 'three', 'quarters', 'film', 'really', 'took', 'sharp', 'nosedive', 'end', 'understand', 'Hollywood', 'obsessed', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much.Thank', 'god', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'Betty', 'White', 'Cloris', 'Leachman']",N/A

Everyone was great, this is one of those movies that you can tell the cast had fun making. Which always makes a movie better. For the story, Marni was tortured by Joanna in high school and has spent her post high school life changing her view of herself and making herself a success. Now she's heading back home for her brother's wedding, but unbeknowst to her Joanna is the bride to be. Things get further tangled when Joanna's aunt Ramona comes into the picture. Ramona and Gail(Marni's mom) also share some high school history. But has the mean girl really changed and does she deserve a second chance. Kristen Bell(Marni) + Odette Yustman(Joanna) are great as the bullied and the bully. And Jamie Lee Curtis(Gail) + Sigourney Weaver(Ramona) are equally good as, well I'll let you figure that out. And how can I leave out the great Betty White as Grandma Bunny, always funny no matter what. There is also a great supporting cast w/ Victor Garber as Mark(Marni's father), Jimmy Wolk as Will(Marni's brother/Joanna's fiancee), Sean Wing as Charlie(Will's friend), Kyle Bornheimer as Tim(Joanna's ?), Kristin Chenoweth as Georgia(the wedding planner), and Billy Unger as Ben(Marni's younger brother). The story line is predictable but it's so funny/cute that you won't even care. A great cast and a funny(although predictable)story make this one of those movies that's few and far between.

The film would also feature appearances by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Kristin Chenoweth, Patrick Duffy and Cloris Leachman.VIDEO:""You Again"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The colors are very vibrant for the film.  From the clothing presented in the film, the color pallet used to bring out a character such as Kristin Bell wearing yellow, Jamie Lee Curtis and Sigourney Weaver in their red outfit, everything looks very good and colors do pop.  As for detail, sure you can see the detail of scenes such as a muddy Kristen Bell, a lardy Kristin Bell, pimples and ant bites on Kristen Bell, these are quite detailed in the film but other than that, it's not extraordinary eye catching in terms of color vibrancy but the film does look very good.I didn't catch any banding, artifacting or any other video problems that hinders the look and feel of the film.  There is a good amount of color use throughout the film and the film's vibrancy is what stands out the most.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""You Again"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24bit).  The film is pretty much front and center-channel driven as it's mostly about the dialogue and of course, it's music soundtrack with Queen, Hall & Oates and Britney Spears.  Dialogue is clear but I didn't hear too much use of the surround channels for crowd ambiance.  Otherwise, for a dialogue-driven film, the lossless soundtrack is appropriate.Subtitles are presented in English and English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""You Again"" comes with the following special features:* FOLLOWING FICKMAN: ON SET WITH THE DIRECTOR: (7:03) Peer into the madcap mind of Hollywood's wackiest director, Andy Fickman, as he orchestrates the comedy of Kristen Bell, Sigourney Weaver, Jamie Lee Curtis and Betty White.* ASK THE CAST: (1:22) Jaime Lee Curtis, Betty White, Sigourney Weaver and Kristen Bell answer questions from fans asking for advice. Betty's advise might not be what you expect.* FUNNY OR DIE: (3:00) In this behind-the-scenes interview spoof, Jaime Lee Curtis, Betty White, Sigourney Weaver, Odette Yustman and Kristen Bell discuss the movie when things get tense between the actresses eventually boiling over into a cast fight.* BLOOPER DANCE PARTY: (5:18) On-set antics abound as the cast dances to their own beat.* ADDITIONAL DELETED SCENES: (27:22) Director Andy Fickman provides intros to his deleted scenes (optional). ""Good Morning Sunshine,"" ""Grandma Bunny's House (featuring Betty White),"" ""Meet Georgia King (with Betty White),"" ""Gail's Shower/Ramona's Dress,"" ""The Compost Heap (with Betty White),"" ""Covered In Lard (with Betty White),"" ""Bridal Shower (with Betty White),"" ""After The Fiasco,  ""Sharing A Room,"" ""Photo Album Memories,"" and ""Riding The Silk.""EXTRAS:""You Again"" comes with a slip over case and a DVD of the film.  The DVD is presented in widescreen (2:40:1), English, French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 and with subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to filmmaker Andy Fickman, he's a filmmaker that loves to have fun during the making of a comedy film and knows how to make the talent and crew have a good time while filming.  He brings a family atmosphere behind-the-scenes and I have watched enough ""behind-the-scenes"" material from his films to know that people love working with him.And as I have enjoyed his films such as ""Race to Witch Mountain"" and even ""The Game Plan"", ""You Again"" is one of those films that has that ""Mean Girls"" type of vibe.  It's a comedy popcorn flick that you just sitback and enjoy and understand that you're going to see some crazy moments, kitschy moments and if you enjoy any of the talents in this film, just enjoy it for what it is.With that being said, the film has not received great reviews.  Many have blasted the film as being contrived, embarrassing and just not cool!For me, I found ""You Again"" to be watchable, funny and also quite amusing as I enjoyed seeing Jamie Lee Curtis and Sigourney Weaver together in a film.  It was great to see Betty White once again a comedy film and as for Kristin Bell, sine her appearance on ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", despite becoming a serious actress post-""Veronica Mars"", we are seeing her in films such as ""Couples Retreat"" and ""When in Rome"".  I'm sure she's a versatile actress but it seems that she has been pigeonholed in comedy films and for the most part, it works.What doesn't work is the screenplay.The film as mentioned earlier has a feel of ""Mean Girls 2' and also ""Freaky Friday"" minus Lindsay Lohan, we get Kristen Bell as Marni as she goes tete-a-tete against Yustman's Joann.  The same for Curtis' Blair and Weaver's Ramona.  And while these rivalries are fun to watch, it's the little things that are peppered into the story that are just ridiculous.For one, the storyline of Joann's ex-boyfriend Tim working with the wedding planner and then going teary-eyed of how he was once engaged to Joann during their marriage ceremony was just ridiculous.  And one thing that even furthers the kitschiness is when Joann and her friends start performing a dance routine to Britney Spears' ""Toxic"".  The routine wouldn't be so bad if the friend's weren't pregnant.  It just didn't seem right at all.Also, just the sheer fact that Darryl Hall & John Oates music is a big part of this film (and yes, they make an appearance in the film), the film is about young people who graduated high school in 2002 and are now professionals working careers in 2010.  While, I can see my '80s classmates going crazy for Hall & Oates, I just don't see any Generation Y young adults clamoring for Hall & Oates.  Perhaps Flickman was hoping what a TV show liked ""Glee"" and ""Laguna Beach"" did for Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"", people would feel the same for Hall & Oates' ""Kiss on Your List"".But with that being said, having watched Kristen Bell in ""When in Rome"" and ""Couples Retreat"", you come into this film not exactly expecting an Academy Award performance.  If anything, I was expecting to see the cast just come together and have fun and ""You Again"" does have its moments of fun.If anything, I know for some critics, the film was painful.  But at the same time, I've read one critic who wrote about how the film was an insult to intellectuals.  And if any intellectual was going to see this movie and expect something deep and compleat, well, I suppose they are going to be disappointed.I have always said in my reviews of similar comedies, especially when it comes to Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell comedy films, these are films meant to get away from reality, enjoy your popcorn and have fun for 90-120 minutes.  The same can be said with ""You Again"".  It's definitely kitschy but it's also fun.  If you are fan of Kristen Bell, Jamie Lee Curtis, Sigourney Weaver and Betty White, you can't help but enjoy the ride and see where these women are going to take you.Sure, the Hall & Oates scene may make one feel embarrassed but it's not different from Jennifer Garner's Michael Jackson ""Thriller"" dance in ""13 Going On 30'.  Embarrassing as it may be, it's probably one of the funner moments of the film because if you grew up with the '80s music, you can't help but sing along to it and embarrassing your family members while you are singing the song while watching the film at home.As for the Blu-ray release, ""You Again"" is fun, especially with the special features and seeing Fickman and crew having fun during the shooting of the film and once again seeing the women of ""You Again"" just having fun with each other, especially Betty White during the ""Funny or Die"" special feature.Overall, ""You Again"" is a film that achieves its intended result of being a comedy popcorn flick.  It is contrived, it is embarrassing but yet it can be fun, that is...if you are open to these type of comedy films.",3,"Blu-ray: ""You Again"" is a film that achieves its intended result of being a

But, it's respectful of friendship, forgiveness, character and marriage. Jamie Lee Curtis and Sigourney Weaver are delightfully amusing and seem to enjoy every bit of working together in this film. There is a scene at the end of the movie that is hilarious and worth every bit of cheese and I can't say one more thing about it because it would be a big spoiler.

Marni (Kristen Bell), once a four-eyed high school scrapmouth mercilessly picked on by J.J. (Odette Yustman), the chief Mean Girl, is now a successful Vice President of Public Relations. She returns home for her brother's wedding, only to discover that her brother is marrying J.J. (now Johanna), who claims not to remember her from High School. The first half of YOU AGAIN is primarily about Marni's attempts to get Johanna to acknowledge their former relationship (and apologize for it).While Marni fixates on her High School nemesis, her mother Gail (Jaime Lee Curtis) reestablishes her long-ago relationship with Johanna's aunt Ramona (Sigourney Weaver), once her best friend and chief rival. Their rivalry reestablishes itself as well. A whole series of not very funny mean-spirited and spiteful incidents makes up the second half of the film, as Marni and Johanna and Gail and Ramona attempt to humiliate one another.The premise of YOU AGAIN is a simple one: People, particularly women, are immature, vengeful idiots who never emotionally outgrow their teenage traumas. In real life, these four would be embracing one another in forgiveness and perhaps reminiscing about how silly it all was. In YOU AGAIN, the injuries done don't only never get undone, they get perpetuated. Arguments about name-calling and prom dresses seem to obsess these women, who, after all, haven't been in High School in decades. Nobody is really happy in YOU AGAIN until everyone is miserable and the wedding is a shambles. Whoever the Producer was who thought this misogynistic abuse-fest would be funny needs to be in therapy. A lot of it, for a long time.The best, funniest roles are played by Victor Garber as Marni's Dad/Gail's Husband, who admits, ""I don't know much about Girl World. As a matter of fact it seems rather mysterious and terrifying to me..."" and Betty White (as Grandma Bunny) whose incongruous wisecracks provide 90% of the laughs---at the end, she meets Johanna's Grandmother (Cloris Leachman), HER former rival (and MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW co-star), with the greeting, ""Oh, don't you look wonderful!

I liked all of the actresses and felt that they all fit their roles well and acted them out. I also loved when Marnie stood up to Johanna and made others see how terrible Johanna was to her in high school.What made me drop this rating to a 2 was the cliched ending. How often have we seen movies where the victim forgives the bully and they become friends and everything becomes all dandy? It's a overused and abused trope. Joanna tearfully admits to Marni near the end of the movie that she should have apologized for everything right away when she met Marni again after high school, yet at the rehearsal dinner, Johanna was terrible to Marni and tried to push her around again, and even after the airing of the high school tape, she still tried to be mean to Marni and tried to make her feel bad despite being the bully. Doesn't look like someone is sorry to me. The actress who did Johanna did a good job, but the writing for her character was inconsistent, and the ending was way too cliche.I'd love to see a movie where the victim gets revenge on the bully, the bully breaks down and apologizes and asks for forgiveness, and the victim tells them to eff off, leaving the bully to wallow around in his/her own patheticness and despair.

This is a revenge comedy with an obvious female focus starring Kristen Bell who lived under the terror of the head cheerleader played by Odette Yustman in her high school days.  She's a successful enough business type who comes back for her brother's wedding only to discover while on the plane ride home that she hasn't recovered from those wounds b/c said enemy is marrying her brother (head cheerleader is no longer going by her nickname so it isn't obvious at first).  What entails is an attempt to prove that head cheerleader is putting on an act.  The cast makes the show and there are actually some very funny moments within that can't be said of a lot of recent comedies I've watched.  The surprise had an interesting enough twist to it but if you watch these types of shows all the time (I do not) then it may have been predictable.  Nice connection between the two families having female rivalries over the generations.  Curtis and Weaver arguably have the best opposing roles as friends gone competitors.  Cameos by ""The Rock"", Patrick Duffy and Darryl Hall & John Oates. Tim, played by Kyle Bornheimer, did an awesome job with a reveal twist at the wedding party.

Awkward type comes back home as ""winner"" (while ""winner"" is waiting at home in awkward situation) and novelty ensues.  Just plug in actors as these types and you cash in.Oops.  First off, this movie should give you a greater appreciation for Sandra Bullock.  She can play the lead in this formula in a quirky but natural way.  Not so with Kristen Bell.  She's the same person throughout the film, just with some make up changes.  Plus, she and all the other actors are stiff and two-dimensional, they are trying but can't gain traction.I blame the script.  There is no third dimension here.  (Prepare to cringe at this assertion:) The missing factor is ""values.""  The mean girl now wants to be nice.  Why?  As some sort of nebulous tribute to dead parents.  The shy girl now wants to look like a winner.  Why?  Well, respect I suppose but do her values really change by the end of the film?  There is no genuine tension or struggle here between value systems, just awkward situations.  Genuine comedy has depth (typically the challenge to ""grow up"" -- see Adam Sandler or Bill Murray or even Will Ferrell).The only actor who made the character ""work"" is Sigourney Weaver.  Even then, mostly with the one-liners where her character drops foreign or sophisticated words/phrases into her sentences.  Weaver generally has a brooding look that makes this sort of stretch seem like it is indeed a stretch for her character.
