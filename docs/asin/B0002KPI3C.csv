838664,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002KPI3C,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[35, 37]","After watching this film all I could think about was how I would love to take this premise and use it on some of America's finest directors.  Money, power, and wealth.  These are just some of the elements that you gain by having a blockbuster film, but can you take your pride and joy and transform it into different avenues while still keeping the overall tone the same?  It is a tough question, one that I wonder if our American directors could accomplish.  I wonder if Peter Jackson, Spielberg, or Lucas could take their prized collections and still have the creative mind to make the same film with some ""obstructions""?  My initial answer would be ""no"", but I wouldn't mind seeing them try.This film was brilliant to say the least.  I went into it without really knowing anything about Jorgen Leth, and finished wanting to see more of his work.  I was impressed with his original film The Perfect Human and thought that his four remakes were nothing short of outstanding.  Each one was perfect in its own right and yet somehow was able to continue the overall themes and elements.  They were works of a genius.  This leads me to another question I had while watching this film.  Did Trier know that Leth could do this?  Trier was once a student of Leth and considers him to be the best director our there, he must have known that Leth could accomplish such tasks.  In fact, I think this may have been Trier's way of allowing a new generation to experience the brilliant mind of Leth.  Trier pushed Leth to new levels, but I think in a way he knew that Leth would be able to overcome and provide some new and beautiful shots.  Trier seemed like a very hard nosed person in this film, and that he constantly ordered, instead of asking his subject to do things.  I think we witnessed Trier in his original form.  Kidman has reported as saying that Trier is very difficult to work for and I think it is because of the way that Trier works.  Very similar to Gilliam, Trier has the vision in his mind.  He knows how he wants the scene to play out, and unless it works just as much as it did in his mind, he will not be happy.  Why not?  It is his film.  Some actors and others in the business call it insanity, but I think it is the talent of a beautiful director.  That is why I am a fan of both Trier and Gilliam, and now Leth.While it is interesting to see these two directors work against and for each other, the ultimate enjoyment is the different renditions of The Perfect Human.  Giving a director the tasks that Trier did may force some of the themes and elements of original short to be lost in the shuffle; Leth never allows that to happen.  It is amazing to see the similarities, yet subtle differences between the original and the new.  Each of them work and give such a intense new spin on the story.  Within all of this we begin to see the themes leaving the work, and coming straight at these directors.  Trier is trying to show that Leth is just as human and emotional as the subject in his film.  In fact, Trier even shows that Leth is as human and emotional as himself.  They way this is shown is very subtle, but it is there.  We are working with two different filmmakers.  One is young and a very prominent name in cinema, while the other is aging and as generations continues to gap, losing followers to his film.  Trier wanted, and does, show that there is little difference between himself and Leth.  They are both humans.  They are both full of emotion.My favorite scene was when Trier mentions to Leth that he wants Leth to feel like a ""tortoise on his back"".  He wants Leth to experience hardship and struggle, perhaps even frustration, and therefore Trier gives him the cartoon obstruction.  In a very mocking fashion, Leth happens to put a tortoise in the film.  The ball is in your court, von Trier.Overall, this is an amazing film.  I am an enormous fan of short films, and to see little snippets of Leth's mind was exciting and revolutionary.  I recommend this film to anyone that is fed up with the lack of creativity in the ""reality"" based television series and long for something more artistic.  This film reminded me of walking through an art museum and seeing several works from Leth.  It is a place I would never want to leave.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,"""Reality"" television ... eat your heart out!

After watching Jorgen Leth talking to Lars, and then flying around the world to film the shorts that Lars wanted with all the obstacles Lars put in front of him, I was happy, and more importantly amazed the Jorgen made 4 extremely wonderful remakes of his already great short ""The Perfect Human."" Lars wanted Jorgen to fall on his back with the obstructions and see him return home with a bad remake, but it wasnt possible. Maybe Lars already knew it was impossible for Jorgen to fail, and just wanted to make the work of this director be known around the world.

838666,A2AVH5HXH2TYWA,B0002KPI3C,CADJewellerySkills,"[1, 1]","I'm aware that the second I start talking about this movie, I'm stepping into a cultural minefield. Lars Von Trier is a divisive director at best, with everyone either loving him with chin stroking high-brow fascination or hating him for his pretentious, abusive reputation. If you add to that Jorgen Leth, an individual few people outside of film school will have ever heard of, and you end up with possibly the most esoteric homage to any director in cinematic history.Having said that, this is quite a remarkable movie. Jorgen's understated skill really does deserve the attention it receives here. Von Trier seems to understand the relative lack of public knowledge of his hero Jorgens' work, and so happily introduces us to just long enough bits of the director's most famous short movie as to earn our respect without making us watch the whole thing again from start to finish. (Incidentally, the extended version of this DVD comes with the original short film ""The Perfect Man."")The whole movie is set up along the lines of a reality TV show challenge. Lars sets 5 separate challenges to Jorgen to reinvent his movie, and we get to see not only the discussions of the ""obstructions"", but some of the filming, and ultimately the new short movie itself. While these may seem almost arbitrary at first, the choices become very effective and telling insights into the way Jorgen thinks as a director, as well as his ability to generate a compelling image.The handling of the cinematography throughout is quite effective, and the relationship between the two men is balanced with just enough tension from the visuals to keep the movie's pace moving. Put it this way, it's a telling sign of Lars Von Trier's skill as a director that he can make a 2 hour movie about two directors talking so watchable.Finally, the fact that this movie treats its subject matter with such affection makes it by far the most gentle Von Trier movie he's ever made, and therefore the easiest one to stomach.",4,Quite enjoyable,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,1987,"[""'m"", 'aware', 'second', 'start', 'talking', 'movie', ""'m"", 'stepping', 'cultural', 'minefield', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'divisive', 'director', 'best', 'everyone', 'loving', 'chin', 'stroking', 'high-brow', 'fascination', 'hating', 'pretentious', 'abusive', 'reputation', 'add', 'Jorgen', 'Leth', 'individual', 'few', 'people', 'film', 'school', 'will', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'end', 'up', 'possibly', 'most', 'esoteric', 'homage', 'director', 'cinematic', 'history.Having', 'said', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'Jorgen', 'understated', 'skill', 'really', 'deserve', 'attention', 'here', 'Von', 'Trier', 'understand', 'relative', 'lack', 'public', 'knowledge', 'hero', 'Jorgens', 'work', 'so', 'happily', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'bits', 'director', 'most', 'famous', 'short', 'movie', 'earn', 'respect', 'making', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'again', 'start', 'finish', 'Incidentally', 'extended', 'version', 'DVD', 'original', 'short', 'film', 'Perfect', 'Man', 'whole', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'lines', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'challenge', 'Lars', '5', 'separate', 'challenges', 'Jorgen', 'reinvent', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'discussions', 'obstructions', 'filming', 'ultimately', 'new', 'short', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'almost', 'arbitrary', 'first', 'choices', 'become', 'very', 'effective', 'telling', 'insights', 'way', 'Jorgen', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'ability', 'generate', 'compelling', 'image.The', 'handling', 'cinematography', 'quite', 'effective', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'balanced', 'just', 'enough', 'tension', 'visuals', 'keep', 'movie', 'pace', 'moving', 'Put', 'way', 'telling', 'sign', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'skill', 'director', 'can', 'make', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'two', 'directors', 'talking', 'so', 'watchable.Finally', 'fact', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', 'such', 'affection', 'far', 'most', 'gentle', 'Von', 'Trier', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'therefore', 'easiest', 'one', 'stomach']",N/A
838667,A75D879GZ09X2,B0002KPI3C,"Cesar Diaz ""madmundo""","[2, 2]","I didn't know who Jorgen Leth was prior to watching this film. I did know however Mr. Lars Von Trier, and against all judgments, I didn't regard him as the great filmmaker some say he is. I actually didn't like the way he made anything he touched look so dirty (cinematically speaking). Now, as biased as this might sound, now I have to say: If you watch one Lars Von Trier film, I hope you watch this one. I guess the reason is contrast: this time, the subject of Von Trier's experiments is a stylist. Danish director and then honorary consul to Haiti, Leth is not only Von Trier's mentor, but also the director of an interesting black and white short film called ""The Perfect Human"" (1967), which is the excuse for Von Trier's daring and oddly loving obstructions. Leth will have to re-do his film five times, each with an inviolable set of rules imposed by Von Trier. Leth wants to keep his integrity as an artist against Von Trier's bet: that Leth will only take flight when he fails both as an artist and as a human being. This only explains the way the match starts. I hope you watch the movie, see how it ends, and make your own conclussions. I'd only like to say one more thing. Nestor Almendros, the Spanish cinematographer of Terrence Malick's ""Days of Heaven"", once said the talent of an artist lies in making effects out of defects. Which is another way to say that in the face of obstruction, a true artist will smile and go on. This movie is also about that.I also gave this film five stars because of the DVD.

838668,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0002KPI3C,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 1]","Imagine making a stylish sexy film about a Plain Jane. That's the feeling I got watching the 90 minute, 2004 film The Five Obstructions, jointly made and produced by Danish filmmakers Jrgen Leth and Lars Von Trier. Ostensibly, the film is about Trier's challenge to noted documentarian Leth, who seems to have been Trier's mentor, if not idol, in film school, to somehow remake a twelve minute film of his from 1967 in five new ways. That black and white film, The Perfect Human (or Det Perfekte Menneske), is typical of avant-garde films of the day- aseptic, poseur, minimalist, bereft of depth- both in Europe and in America- especially the Andy Warhol Factory. While not a great nor profound film, for it has pretentiously bad pseudo-poetry being read over images of an attractive Danish man and woman posing as perfect humans, the original film does have a certain earnest power, the sort only young artists seem to bring to their work. Flash forward a third of a century, to 2000, and Trier is issuing a challenge to Leth, sort of a less somber Werner Herzog in temperament, to remake the film five different ways, each way, though, with an `obstruction', really only a limitation. Leth accepts the challenge for what it seems to be, seemingly unaware that Trier is actually doing a documentary about Leth and his creative process. each obstruction is designed to show off Leth's presumed genius at getting around the obstruction.On the downside, the film would have worked better if the original and the subsequent films had been shown in their entirety, and not only in excerpts. Still, it's a synergistic film that is not postmodern, despite its pretensions. Nor is it truly deconstructive. Instead it's self-exploration using the art itself, which is, despite claims, the essence of such a venture. Also, as filmic memoir, it makes the viewer take for granted all its assumptions of the men's relationships. The editing, by Camilla Skousen and Morten Hjbjerg, especially in the fifth obstruction, is excellent.",3,Good,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,2019,"['Imagine', 'making', 'stylish', 'sexy', 'film', 'Plain', 'Jane', 'feeling', 'got', 'watching', '90', 'minute', '2004', 'film', 'Five', 'Obstructions', 'jointly', 'made', 'produced', 'Danish', 'filmmakers', 'Jrgen', 'Leth', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'Ostensibly', 'film', 'Trier', 'challenge', 'noted', 'documentarian', 'Leth', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'Trier', 'mentor', 'not', 'idol', 'film', 'school', 'somehow', 'remake', 'twelve', 'minute', 'film', '1967', 'five', 'new', 'ways', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'Perfect', 'Human', 'Det', 'Perfekte', 'Menneske', 'typical', 'avant-garde', 'films', 'day-', 'aseptic', 'poseur', 'minimalist', 'bereft', 'depth-', 'Europe', 'America-', 'especially', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Factory', 'not', 'great', 'profound', 'film', 'pretentiously', 'bad', 'pseudo-poetry', 'being', 'read', 'images', 'attractive', 'Danish', 'man', 'woman', 'posing', 'perfect', 'humans', 'original', 'film', 'have', 'certain', 'earnest', 'power', 'sort', 'only', 'young', 'artists', 'seem', 'bring', 'work', 'Flash', 'forward', 'third', 'century', '2000', 'Trier', 'issuing', 'challenge', 'Leth', 'sort', 'less', 'somber', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'temperament', 'remake', 'film', 'five', 'different', 'ways', 'way', 'obstruction', 'really', 'only', 'limitation', 'Leth', 'challenge', 'what', 'be', 'seemingly', 'unaware', 'Trier', 'actually', 'doing', 'documentary', 'Leth', 'creative', 'process', 'obstruction', 'designed', 'show', 'off', 'Leth', 'presumed', 'genius', 'getting', 'obstruction.On', 'downside', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'original', 'subsequent', 'films', 'had', 'been', 'shown', 'entirety', 'not', 'only', 'excerpts', 'Still', 'synergistic', 'film', 'not', 'postmodern', 'pretensions', 'truly', 'deconstructive', 'Instead', 'self-exploration', 'using', 'art', 'claims', 'essence', 'such', 'venture', 'Also', 'filmic', 'memoir', 'viewer', 'take', 'granted', 'assumptions', 'men', 'relationships', 'editing', 'Camilla', 'Skousen', 'Morten', 'Hjbjerg', 'especially', 'fifth', 'obstruction', 'excellent']",N/A
838669,AQ990HW13DP08,B0002KPI3C,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[0, 0]","In 1967 the Danish director Jorgen Leth made a 12-minute film called The Perfect Human (be sure to get the DVD that includes this as an extra, and watch it first). In this documentary the controversial director Lars von Trier challenges his mentor to remake the film, which captivated him so much that he viewed it twenty times, but to do so following five different ""obstructions"" that he stipulates. First, he must film in Cuba with no set and no shot longer than 12 frames (about half a second). Next, he must go to wherever Leth feels is ""the most miserable place on earth"" and remake the film with himself playing the lead role, and so that it does not reveal the location. Third, Leth is given complete freedom to do as he pleases. Next, he must remake the film as an animated cartoon, since that is a medium both of them despise. Finally, in the most poignant part of the film, Leth must simply narrate a script written by von Trier, that is, the master must relinquish all control to his imperious student.At one level this film is a fascinating look inside the aesthetic process, and how ostensible limitations can provoke rather than diminish creativity, for Leth does not, in fact, produce what von Trier predicts will be ""a piece of crap"" that ""ruins a little gem."" I was reminded, for example, of the strictures imposed by, say, eighteenth century musical style, which music is immediately recognizable because of that style, and yet on the other hand the limitless creativity that Mozart used to explore and expand the genre. At a second level, the film explores the ethics of the relationship between the subjective film maker and both his local context and the ""objects"" he films (often people, of course). Can Leth really make a film in the red light district of Bombay without being impacted by that context, or by ignoring it altogether? Would it be false to try such? Does he not have any personal qualms about filming a sumptuous dinner amidst starving masses? Third, we have here a contest between two different film styles, in which the iconoclastic von Trier tries to demolish the classical style of his teacher. Finally, von Trier admits that he is trying to ""banalize"" Leth, to force him to make a film that ""marks"" him or gets under his skin so that he cannot hide his true self behind the safety of the camera. He wants Leth to squirm like a turtle wriggling on its back. That is, he wants to prove that his mentor and idol is not ""the perfect human.""

As the taskmaster of a twisted private game, von Trier compels Leth to painstakingly recreate his 1967 surrealist short, The Perfect Human, on five different occasions with a gauntlet of handicaps and restrictions. A shoot might require that he employ no more than twelve frames between cuts or travel across the globe, and Leth is merrily game for it all. Ultimately, the goal is to strip the film down to the core and unravel its mysteries - many of which were seemingly lost to the director himself - and it does successfully dip a few toes into those waters. But as Leth gets more films under his belt, the obstructions become more passive, quizzical and vague.

It is hard to think of another recent film that is so thought-provokingly centered around the challenge of artistic production.  And the film becomes genuinely quite moving as it moves to a conclusion and as von Trier's motives for the game come more clearly into focus.One odd (and perhaps telling) question raised by the DVD release is when one should watch actually the original short ""The Perfect Human.""  The short itself is only seen in snippets throughout The Five Obstructions and I dare say that the chances of any American viewer already having seen it are close to absolute zero.  It's my assumption, given that they certainly could have squeezed it in, that von Trier and Leth decided not to include the full original short in the theatrical film release in order to keep you from focusing on the details of comparison between the versions.  That is, by not showing it, they remind you that the real point of this film is not really to dwell on the resulting remakes against the original but rather, by following Leth making these films, to focus on the human struggle to invest life with meaning through the creative process.  So I suggest that you resist the temptation to watch the short first: although in some ways not knowing the original short makes you feel a bit slow and out of the loop at times, I think their choice not to feature it is the right one.Of course, von Trier exhibits a bit of his renowned fiendishly sadistic streak that many of his critics have complained of in his own films.  But I honestly think von Trier conclusively demonstrates here that this aspect of his work comes out of love really, his desire to push Leth to rise to the challenge, and I take the similar streak in his narrative films to reflect the same love of his audience.  As with Hitchcock, von Trier's toying with his audience is not just to demonstrate mastery over the film viewer but to push our buttons into a cathartic emotional reaction, to make us think and work harder.

Von Trier had learned from his mentor the importance of establishing rules and restrictions as tools of artistry, that contrary to appearances actually serve as inspirations and occasions for creative interpretation and exploration.  The technique that has served Leth so well in a series of subtle and compelling experimental works and documentaries is to find a subject that interests him and isolate it aesthetically, allowing the subject to reveal itself only under the condition of the precise coordinates he has himself defined in advance, that control the look and feel of its appearance.In this film Von Trier aims to turn the tables on his teacher, putting himself in charge and forcing Leth to reveal himself.  He challenges Leth to remake his classic experimental short, ""The Perfect Human"" -- which von Trier considers to be a perfect film -- but this time subject to a series of increasingly rigorous and challenging restrictions.  His aim, as comes to be apparent, is not merely to create a challenge for his hero, but to trip him up, to force him to reveal himself, to come out from behind the camera and drop the mask of impartial observer.  Von Trier sets himself up, in other words, as the psychotherapist to a resistant patient, who refuses to admit he is sick.  The sickness, as von Trier sees it, is the pretense of objectivity, the veneer of calm and control, that he presumes must mask an underlying anxiety, analogous to that of von Trier himself, to which he has readily admitted.  The therapy involves setting up conditions that undermine his usual techniques, and thereby force him to reveal himself in all his imperfect humanity.  Of course it doesn't work, as with each new test, Leth finds creative and inventive ways to achieve something special and compelling.It's a fascinating and funny struggle to watch, a kind of intellectual wrestling match between two brilliant and inventive artists, one a master of control and the other a master of chaos.  It is a rare film that can be at once amusing, profound, inventive and inspirational.  I find that every time I watch it, and see the very human Jorgen Leth rise to each challenge, that it leads me to reflect on my own capacity for artistry and self reinvention.  As with Rilke's famous poem, that reminds us of the powerful suggestive power of great art, every time I watch this fascinating film I find myself faced with a palpable challenge: ""You must change your life!""",5,"A provocative and perverse study of the human being behind the camera, a fascinating and challenging film about life and art",1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,2628,"['film', 'easy', 'classification', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'role', 'perverse', 'provocateur', 'former', 'teacher', 'cinematic', 'idol', 'Danish', 'film', 'icon', 'Jorgen', 'Leth', 'Von', 'Trier', 'had', 'learned', 'mentor', 'importance', 'establishing', 'rules', 'restrictions', 'tools', 'artistry', 'contrary', 'appearances', 'actually', 'serve', 'inspirations', 'occasions', 'creative', 'interpretation', 'exploration', 'technique', 'served', 'Leth', 'so', 'well', 'series', 'subtle', 'compelling', 'experimental', 'works', 'documentaries', 'find', 'subject', 'interests', 'isolate', 'aesthetically', 'allowing', 'subject', 'reveal', 'only', 'condition', 'precise', 'coordinates', 'defined', 'advance', 'control', 'look', 'feel', 'appearance.In', 'film', 'Von', 'Trier', 'turn', 'tables', 'teacher', 'putting', 'charge', 'forcing', 'Leth', 'reveal', 'Leth', 'remake', 'classic', 'experimental', 'short', 'Perfect', 'Human', 'von', 'Trier', 'considers', 'be', 'perfect', 'film', 'time', 'subject', 'series', 'increasingly', 'rigorous', 'challenging', 'restrictions', 'aim', 'be', 'apparent', 'not', 'merely', 'create', 'challenge', 'hero', 'trip', 'up', 'force', 'reveal', 'come', 'out', 'camera', 'drop', 'mask', 'impartial', 'observer', 'Von', 'Trier', 'up', 'other', 'words', 'psychotherapist', 'resistant', 'patient', 'who', 'admit', 'sick', 'sickness', 'von', 'Trier', 'pretense', 'objectivity', 'veneer', 'calm', 'control', 'must', 'mask', 'underlying', 'anxiety', 'analogous', 'von', 'Trier', 'readily', 'admitted', 'therapy', 'setting', 'up', 'conditions', 'undermine', 'usual', 'techniques', 'thereby', 'force', 'reveal', 'imperfect', 'humanity', 'course', ""n't"", 'work', 'new', 'test', 'Leth', 'creative', 'inventive', 'ways', 'achieve', 'something', 'special', 'compelling.It', 'fascinating', 'funny', 'struggle', 'watch', 'kind', 'intellectual', 'wrestling', 'match', 'two', 'brilliant', 'inventive', 'artists', 'one', 'master', 'control', 'other', 'master', 'chaos', 'rare', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'once', 'amusing', 'profound', 'inventive', 'inspirational', 'find', 'time', 'watch', 'see', 'very', 'human', 'Jorgen', 'Leth', 'rise', 'challenge', 'reflect', 'own', 'capacity', 'artistry', 'self', 'reinvention', 'Rilke', 'famous', 'poem', 'powerful', 'suggestive', 'power', 'great', 'art', 'time', 'watch', 'fascinating', 'film', 'find', 'faced', 'palpable', 'challenge', 'must', 'change', 'life']",N/A
