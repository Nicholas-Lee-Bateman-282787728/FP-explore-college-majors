This was an ambitious film and I hung on it's every moment. From the music, to the sets, to the script and actors it is just a great movie!!Josh (Ryan Barrett) can't sleep and since he can't sleep he is in constant turmoil. His thoughts are out of control along with his life. He talks his doctor into giving him sleeping pills so that he can get some rest and deal with his life. He is certain that all he needs is sleep.While asleep he wakes to a parallel life or an alternative universe where he is with his wife/finance' (I am not sure which) perished in a fire. whatever you want to call it, it is the life he feels he was destined to live. In order to get back to that life and away from his current wife Meg, and the rat infested, stopped up toilet apartment he must take more pills.Josh is unbalanced and his psychosis is making him crazy until he is no longer certain which life is real.The movie is interesting and I appreciate the parallels between the two lives, between the light and dark, good and evil, ying and yang.If you have a chance see this movie!",4,"Great Movie About Recapturing The Past Or Parallel Lives, You Choose!",1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,1144,"['411', 'Maria', 'am', 'super', 'impressed', 'writer/director', 'Chad', 'Archibald', 'was', 'ambitious', 'film', 'hung', 'moment', 'music', 'sets', 'script', 'actors', 'just', 'great', 'movie', 'Josh', 'Ryan', 'Barrett', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'constant', 'turmoil', 'thoughts', 'are', 'control', 'life', 'doctor', 'giving', 'sleeping', 'pills', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'rest', 'deal', 'life', 'certain', 'sleep.While', 'asleep', 'parallel', 'life', 'alternative', 'universe', 'where', 'wife/finance', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'perished', 'fire', 'want', 'call', 'life', 'was', 'destined', 'live', 'order', 'get', 'back', 'life', 'away', 'current', 'wife', 'Meg', 'rat', 'infested', 'stopped', 'up', 'toilet', 'apartment', 'must', 'take', 'more', 'pills.Josh', 'unbalanced', 'psychosis', 'making', 'crazy', 'no', 'longer', 'certain', 'life', 'real.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'appreciate', 'parallels', 'two', 'lives', 'light', 'dark', 'good', 'evil', 'ying', 'yang.If', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'movie']",N/A
