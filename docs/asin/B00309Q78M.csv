I would not have wanted to know any of them.  Trust as portrayed in this series, was not there for the conduct of social/political intercourse.  The consequences of their actions was not very obvious to themselves.  It was a period, like it is right now (2011), when there were not any great leaders anywhere in the world.  The leaders were thugs or sycophants through and through.

Reilly was the first and most successful secret agent in pretending to be someone else. This enabled Britain to know how to get Arab oil and defeat Germany in WWI at sea. Reilly's adventures in Russia were fascinating to me. The 1983 TV series speculated on his torture and death at the hands of Felix Dzerzhinsky and Stalin. When I was in Moscow in 1984 I asked someone with KGB connections if they could tell me what happened. The answer was that they were very familiar with Reilly, considered him one of the greatest threats to the government, but would not discuss his fate.

His charisma, carriage and appeal are a challenge for Sean Connery. He is intelligent, of dubious morals, self-interested and has a bizarre sense of loyalty. It is said that Ian Fleming based Bond upon Reilly, a risk-taking rake and bon-vivant.The cast is superb. From Norman Rodway (Cummings) to Felix Dzerzhinsky (Tom Bell), these are top-shelf performers. There is even a tip of the hat to the occult.Based on the life of Sigmund Rosenblum, the bastard son of a physician, it is set in the adventures of a man who, it is said, spied for 4 countries, Russia being his heartland. It is filled with fascinating characters and stories related (in various degrees) to true events, thus offering historical sidedishes.There is little doubt that Reilly does and will rank as one of the greatest men of espionage and mystery. Viewers will gain full measure of enjoyment in its viewing.",4,A thinking person's Bond,1277510400,"06 26, 2010",2010,980,"['Sam', 'Neill', 'phenomenal', 'fit', 'James', 'Bond', 'earlier', 'version', 'espionage', 'infancy', 'charisma', 'carriage', 'appeal', 'are', 'challenge', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'intelligent', 'dubious', 'morals', 'self-interested', 'bizarre', 'sense', 'loyalty', 'said', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'based', 'Bond', 'Reilly', 'risk-taking', 'rake', 'bon-vivant.The', 'cast', 'superb', 'Norman', 'Rodway', 'Cummings', 'Felix', 'Dzerzhinsky', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'are', 'top-shelf', 'performers', 'even', 'tip', 'hat', 'occult.Based', 'life', 'Sigmund', 'Rosenblum', 'bastard', 'son', 'physician', 'set', 'adventures', 'man', 'who', 'said', 'spied', '4', 'countries', 'Russia', 'being', 'heartland', 'filled', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'stories', 'related', 'various', 'degrees', 'true', 'events', 'thus', 'offering', 'historical', 'sidedishes.There', 'little', 'doubt', 'Reilly', 'will', 'rank', 'one', 'greatest', 'men', 'espionage', 'mystery', 'Viewers', 'will', 'gain', 'full', 'measure', 'enjoyment', 'viewing']",N/A
1314913,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B00309Q78M,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","This is a very fun, if largely apocryphal, version of many of the key events that shaped the 20C. You have a mysterious man, Reilly, who pops up where something absolutely decisive is happening. Ostensively a British agent, he mixes self-enrichment, his personal life, and politics in machinations that can only be called guileful, ruthless, and for the most part effective. He is one of those ambiguous figures that appear at historical turning points, sparking endless debates about whether they are blatant opportunists or the simplest of idealists. You could compare him to Alcibiades, Wallenstein, or perhaps Richard Clarke. The man is a walking paradox - brilliant and passionate, yet perhaps also a greedy sociopathic visionary - and the best part of it is, Sam Neill pulls it off with complete believability, with a stellar group of lesser-known character actors.In terms of plot, Reilly is present for the early maneuvering to gain access to oil - the key to industrialization and mechanized warfare, the bases for 20C power - and then is a player in the Russo-Japanese war, a maintenance worker who steals German shipping blueprints (and an industrialist who does the same thing), and finally a (counter?) revolutionary in the transition of Russia into the Soviet Union. This is a fun and fascinating view into these events, a re-rendering that reminds the viewer that none of these things was set in stone for the history books but could have turned out very differently. To me as a history buff, it makes it come alive in the most wonderful way. Of course, no one knows if Reilly did all these things, so this can only be taken as fiction, but you witness Lenin, Stalin, and a parade of British politicians and bureaucrats and many others.Along the way, Reilly introduces new methods into the British secret service, legitimizing the most ruthless manipulation of people in the cause that he is currently championing. For example in one episode (***spoiler alert***), while apparently out of the spy business and a financier in Russia, he seduces a married aristocrat, who wants to divorce in order to marry him; Reilly then pays off her husband with a settlement, who happens to be Defense Minister in the Tzar's government, legitimizing a commercial agent Reilly needs, and pulls off the ""arms deal of the century"", gaining intelligence for the British, beating an old rival, and hugely enriching himself at the same time. Some cry scandal (he is already married), others see genius.Neill also creates a fascinating character that is revealed slowly throughout the entire series. It is a masterpiece of subtlety and moral ambiguity that is never reduced to a simple formula, but stands as an enigma. The ending is a surprise, yet so typically Reilly. That makes it excellent drama. The sets are also period perfect, evoking a vanished world.  The only problem is the graininess of the transfer, which is a minimal distraction. Interestingly, I got the amazon UK version for about $8.My wife and I are embarking on a viewing of British spy films, kind of the mirror view of my love of mafia film. This is up there with Smiley's People.
