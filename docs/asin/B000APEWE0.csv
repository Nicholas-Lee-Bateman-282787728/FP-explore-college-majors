930635,A1Y01AUJIB5JRE,B000APEWE0,Aamir Ansari,"[3, 3]","I enjoyed watching this movie. It's an evocative exploration of the dissolution of the pre-Independence feudal estates and the old resisting the new. Even though I have no ear for Hindustani classical music, the story and Chhabi Biswas' performance drew me in. I was initially put off by Biswambhar Roy's stiffness and feudal manner but at some point during the movie, as the layers started to peel away, I began to empathise with him. The solace he sought in music was something true to his nature and he genuinely felt aggrieved by what he perceived to be the sullying of his culture. Mahim Ganguly, as the enterprising neighbour who rose from being one of Roy's subjects to becoming a neighbour and surpassing him in wealth, is a little vilified for dramatic effect but I liked that Ray allowed him the opportunity to express his own mind in the scene where he walks outside the derelict mansion waiting for admittance to see the obstinate old landowner.Clearly, a lot of effort has gone into the making of this movie and the Criterion restoration does that great justice. The scenes inside the music room, with the shimmering chandelier and the large mirrors, are crisp and clean and give a good sense of the grandeur of the landowner's life. The mansion itself is shown as being situated in isolation, surrounded by a vast and empty plain, revealing its insularity from the world around it. The private family scenes between the landowner and his wife and son are shot in smaller rooms and give a closer, more intimate feel, humanising Biswambhar Roy. You wonder how much of Roy was merely a product of the environment he grew up in, conditioned to a certain mindset that for generations had been required to function in an authoritative role. Extracted from his estate and its unquestioned privilege, would Roy have been a different person? Was his stiff pride merely a scrim to a sensitive interior, hiding a mind willing to engage with the world? Or was his obstinacy intrinsic to him and not something that had merely grown and hardened over time as everything else collapsed around him? I think it's a credit to Ray's film that it makes us ask these questions.Apart from the excellent restoration, the Criterion edition also includes a full-length documentary Shyam Benegal made on Satyajit Ray, exploring the director's life and works. This in itself is worth the price of the DVD for the opportunity it allows us to get to meet Ray and hear him in conversation. I also enjoyed listening to the short interview with Mira Nair where she talked about her friendship with Satyajit Ray.I haven't seen many of Ray's movies but having watched this I am clearly looking forward to discovering his work. I sincerely hope that Criterion comes out with more of his movies. Their restorations are artful and the subtitling is easy to follow. Additionally, the special features they include with the movie are in themselves quite engaging and add substantially to the appreciation of the original work.",4,Glad that Criterion restored this movie,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,3001,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'evocative', 'exploration', 'dissolution', 'pre-Independence', 'feudal', 'old', 'resisting', 'new', 'Even', 'have', 'ear', 'Hindustani', 'classical', 'music', 'story', 'Chhabi', 'Biswas', 'performance', 'drew', 'was', 'initially', 'put', 'off', 'Biswambhar', 'Roy', 'stiffness', 'feudal', 'manner', 'point', 'movie', 'layers', 'started', 'peel', 'away', 'began', 'empathise', 'solace', 'sought', 'music', 'was', 'something', 'true', 'nature', 'genuinely', 'felt', 'aggrieved', 'what', 'perceived', 'be', 'sullying', 'culture', 'Mahim', 'Ganguly', 'enterprising', 'neighbour', 'who', 'rose', 'being', 'one', 'Roy', 'subjects', 'becoming', 'neighbour', 'surpassing', 'wealth', 'little', 'vilified', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'liked', 'Ray', 'allowed', 'opportunity', 'express', 'own', 'mind', 'scene', 'where', 'derelict', 'mansion', 'waiting', 'admittance', 'see', 'obstinate', 'old', 'landowner.Clearly', 'lot', 'effort', 'gone', 'making', 'movie', 'Criterion', 'restoration', 'great', 'justice', 'scenes', 'music', 'room', 'shimmering', 'chandelier', 'large', 'mirrors', 'are', 'crisp', 'clean', 'give', 'good', 'sense', 'grandeur', 'landowner', 'life', 'mansion', 'shown', 'being', 'situated', 'isolation', 'surrounded', 'vast', 'empty', 'plain', 'revealing', 'insularity', 'world', 'private', 'family', 'scenes', 'landowner', 'wife', 'son', 'are', 'shot', 'smaller', 'rooms', 'give', 'closer', 'more', 'intimate', 'feel', 'humanising', 'Biswambhar', 'Roy', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'Roy', 'was', 'merely', 'product', 'environment', 'grew', 'up', 'conditioned', 'certain', 'mindset', 'generations', 'had', 'been', 'required', 'function', 'authoritative', 'role', 'Extracted', 'estate', 'unquestioned', 'privilege', 'would', 'Roy', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'person', 'Was', 'stiff', 'pride', 'merely', 'scrim', 'sensitive', 'interior', 'hiding', 'mind', 'willing', 'engage', 'world', 'was', 'obstinacy', 'intrinsic', 'not', 'something', 'had', 'merely', 'grown', 'hardened', 'over', 'time', 'everything', 'else', 'collapsed', 'think', 'credit', 'Ray', 'film', 'ask', 'questions.Apart', 'excellent', 'restoration', 'Criterion', 'edition', 'also', 'full-length', 'documentary', 'Shyam', 'Benegal', 'made', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'exploring', 'director', 'life', 'price', 'DVD', 'opportunity', 'get', 'meet', 'Ray', 'hear', 'conversation', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'listening', 'short', 'interview', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'where', 'talked', 'friendship', 'Satyajit', 'Ray.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'Ray', 'movies', 'having', 'watched', 'am', 'clearly', 'looking', 'forward', 'discovering', 'work', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'Criterion', 'out', 'more', 'movies', 'restorations', 'are', 'artful', 'subtitling', 'easy', 'follow', 'Additionally', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'engaging', 'add', 'substantially', 'appreciation', 'original', 'work']",N/A

930637,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000APEWE0,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[11, 11]","Poetic, visually mesmerizing and I would expect nothing less from one of the greatest auteurs of all time.Satyajit Ray.  The Indian Bengali filmmaker was known for his non-traditional Indian films.  Having directed 37 films in his lifetime, many which won multiple awards internationally and his contribution to cinema has earned him an Academy Honorary Award in 1991, his films are beloved by many and many have hoped to see his films receive the Blu-ray treatment in the U.S.And who best than the Criterion Collection who will be releasing Ray's fourth feature film titled ""Jalsaghar"" (The Music Room) on Blu-ray and DVD.""The Music room"" is a film adaptation of Tarashankar Banerjee's short story but instead of creating an exact adaptation, Satyajit Ray would give his own spin to the film, making several changes but also creating a non-traditional film that would have music like most Indian films, but rather the music being an intermission, the music would be integrated as part of the original screenplay and featuring popular Indian music talent of the time: Begum Akhtar, Roshan Kumari, Ustad Waheed Khan and Bismillah Khan.VIDEO:""The Music Room"" is presented in 1080p High Definition black and white.  For a film that could have been lost (the original negative was destroyed in a fire) forever, fortunately, through the collaboration of various companies, ""The Music Room"" was among Satyajit Ray's films that were restored and given an HD transfer on Blu-ray courtesy of the Criterion Collection.There is no better surviving element of the negative than what we see with this film on Blu-ray and I have to say that the film looks great on Blu-ray.  With Satyajit Ray's films, there is a focus on aesthetics, the environment around them.  And its no surprise as Ray was a big fan of filmmaker Jean Renoir and Vittorio De Sica's work.  His attention to detail for his film definitely lends to a more artistic and visually pleasing look as there is a style to his film that one can truly appreciate.  Frm the efficacy of Ray capturing the details of webs on a chandelier, a bug on a painting, to see his estate change through time and more. Possibly one of my favorite shot in this film was how we see a bit of the old, with the elephant grazing in the back, which is then disturbed by Ganguly's motor car that throws dirt all around.  A visual of traditional India and modern India at the time.The contrast was also well-done and while, I'm not going to say that the ""The Music Room"" is absolutely pristine, I will say that for a film that is over 50-years-old and the challenges it has faced in order to be restored, I have no doubt in my mind that the Criterion Collection Blu-ray release is the best version...the definitive version of ""The Music Room"" thus far!  Blacks are nice and deep, really good contrast for the white and grays.Because a lot of Ray's films were shot on triacetate, the film was in danger of deteriorating in warm temperatures.  After Satyajit Ray received his Academy Honorary Award in 1992, the Academy was dismayed that there were few prints and masters of Ray's films in the US and many were now incomplete or in bad condition.  So, the Academy decided to create a catalog of the surviving elements of Ray's films in the US and to assess what was in good condition or what films would be lost.The Academy found that the majority of Ray's films were in jeopardy and so, together with the Satyajit Ray Society, the National Archive of India and the Satyajit Ray Film and Study Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the collaboration would ensure that every element that existed in the world could be accessed to make the best restoration possible.  ""The Music room"" was one of the very first films preserved by the project.According to the Criterion Collection, the laboratory in London suffered a fire and several of Ray's elements and the original camera negative of ""The Music Room"" were destroyed.  But a second generation fine-grain master positive taken from the original camera negative existed in India.  The film would eventually receive restoration and was supervised by Academy director Michael Friend and completed in 1995.The Criterion Collection used a new high-definition digital transfer which was created on a Spirit 4K Datacine from an original 35mm fine-grain master positive.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean ssytem while Digital Vision's system was used for small dirt, grain, noise, reduction and scratches.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:As for the audio, the audio is presented in Bengali and in monaural.  The audio dialogue is clear as is the classical music of the film.According to the Criterion Collection, ""The Music Room"" was remastered at 24-bit from the original 35 mm soundtrack print.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Music Room - The Criterion Collection #573' on Blu-ray comes with the following special features:For the Love of Music - (17:36) Satyajit Ray biographer Andrew Robinson talks about Ray's love for music and Satyajit Ray's idea and working on the film adaptation of ""The Music Room"" and the differences between Ray's version from the book.Mira Nair - (15:44) Filmmaker Mira Nair talks about Satyajit Ray's work, ""The Music Room"" and what she enjoyed about the film.French Roundtable - (10:36) An excerpt from a 1981 French roundtable discussion with Ray, film critic Michel Ciment, and director Claude SautetSatyajit Ray - (2:11:05) A feature documentary from 1984 by Shyam Benegal that chronicles Ray's career through interviews with the filmmaker, family photographs, and extensive clips from his filmsEXTRAS:""The Music Room - The Criterion Collection #573' comes with a 38-page booklet which includes the following essays ""Distant Music"" by Philip Kemp, ""Winding Route to a Music Room"" by Satyajit Ray, ""On the Music of the Music Room: An Interview with Satyajit Ray by Andrew Robinson and information on the Satyajit Ray Preservation Project and restoration of ""The Music Room"".JUDGMENT CALL:Satyajit Ray may be known for the ""Apu Trilogy"", ""The Chess Players"", ""The Visitor"" to name a few but similar to many auteurs, to study and watch a filmmaker's oeuvre, you notice a change in style overtime.With Ray, what was intriguing about this filmmaker is his goal to outdo himself from the previous films, to not have his films fit in a traditional sense of filmmaking but with hopes that his countrymen would enjoy the film, as well as people abroad.  But for Ray, films that he expected to do well in his country would be popular internationally, while films he thought would do well internationally would be popular more in his country.Suffice to say, his films often achieved the opposite of what he was expecting but nevertheless, nearly two decades after his passing, many are discovering Satyajit Ray's films and many are hoping companies would bring them to the US.The Criterion Collection has stepped in by releasing ""The Music Room"" on Blu-ray and DVD but to also show tribute to the filmmaker with the inclusion of the 1984 feature documentary ""Satyajit Ray"" which focuses on the filmmaker's career.""The Music Room"" to me, if I had to describe the film, it was more poetic in the sense that elements of what was shot, had meaning.  Satyajit Ray has talked about how Jean Renoir influenced him and Renoir was important to the precursor of Nouvelle Vague but his efficacy in using the elements in a room or outdoors to enhance the visual structure of the film.  There is meaning behind the environment of ""The Music Room"" as it shows us the past and present of a zamnidar who has had a strong sense of pride but also a man who is incapable of leaving that pride, despite losing nearly everything in his life.I have heard that ""The Music Room"" is different from the original short story that the film was adapted from but Satyajit Ray was able to accomplish a lot with this loose adaptation.  For one, utilizing the character and showing us how he reacts to loss, sadness and rivalry.  But also, possibly an audacious move on the filmmaker's part to include classical Indian music but incorporate it as part of the storyline.In India, the film did well for seven weeks but because it was non-traditional and much different than what Indians were used to in cinema, ""The Music Room"" was no popular in Ray's country but found a big following internationally.  Needless to say, the film was ahead of its time.And as the storyline captures your attention as you see the character of Biswambhlar Roy get lost in his own pride, we see how music plays an important part in the film.  Classical Indian music playing while we watch the characters are they react to the performances.  And the performance is actually breathtaking, especially the final dance as we see the woman dancing and seeing how the men react to the dancing, it was a wonderful scene.  But as mentioned, it was the scenes that featured traditional India and modern India that I found quite interesting.In one shot, we see Roy's wife and son riding by horse and a carriage held by servants, in a later shot, we see Roy's elephant grazing but then seeing that natural setting disrupted by Ganguli's car as it drives through the pathway kicking up dirt all around.But then there are shots where we know that darker things will be coming.  From the dead insect swirling in Roy's drink, to the black spider crawling around his own painting.  Once again, beautiful shots and a film that is well-composed, brilliantly acted by Chhabi Biswas.As for this Criterion Collection Blu-ray release, it's a fantastic release.  It's one thing to get the film, but to get the 1984 feature documentary plus other special features included, it's really enough for me to say that this is one of my favorite Criterion Collection releases on Blu-ray.  An outstanding tribute to one of the finest filmmakers in the world!I may seem biased as an ardent fan of Satyajit Ray's films but ""The Music Room"" is a wonderful, early Satyajit Ray film and as I'm confident we will be seeing Ray's masterpiece, the Apu Trilogy, sooner than later (knock on wood) and more Satyajit Ray films on Blu-ray, this is an excellent release to learn about Ray's work.The 1984 feature documentary by Shyam Benegal is a wonderful tribute to the filmmaker and at over 2 hours, it's an excellent special feature to accompany this release. In the past, I would have bought this documentary alone just to learn more about Ray and his passion for cinema but also to see him work behind-the-scenes.  But the fact that it's included with ""The Music Room"", for me, that is wonderful!It's important to remind everyone when watching ""The Music Room"" is that Satyajit Ray didn't have a lot of money to make this film.  But he made the film with what he had.  Some may have comparisons to King Lear but while the film is indeed a study of pride and carried to the most extreme, the film is extraordinary.And already, I know I have overused the word ""wonderful"" to describe ""The Music Room - The Criterion Collection #573' but it's definitely one of the best Blu-ray's to come from the Criterion Collection thus far.  Granted it may not be too accessible for those not appreciative of cinema or Indian culture but if you are open and want to experience a film from one of the world's finest director's, then ""The Music Room"" is a must-buy for any cineaste!Highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray: Poetic, visually mesmerizing and a 5-star Criterion Collection release!",1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,11624,"['Poetic',

930639,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B000APEWE0,DVD Verdict,"[1, 1]","Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict -- ""The Music Room spends a great deal of its running time offering elaborate stagings of traditional Indian music, but it is unlike any other Indian musicals of the era. While most Indian films of the 1950s relied on melodrama, exaggerated acting and spontaneous musical numbers, Satyajit Ray's gentle tale works in musical sequences in an entirely organic manner and offers performances built on understated naturalism. Even the film's one moment of genuine melodrama (which takes place at the very end) feels like an entirely appropriate, believable resolution to the story that Ray has been telling. The Music Room is an affectionate tale that regards its struggling aristocrat with a good deal of affection. We know he is doomed to allow his pride to take him to the lowest of lows, and we pity him because we know that he must either increase his levels of self-delusion or face the horrors of reality at some point. The closing moments of the film are haunting, beginning with a brilliant close-up of a spider and lurching madly to the finish line from there. While it seems that the original print was damaged beyond repair in some spots (there's a constant stream of white lines and scratches throughout), Criterion has otherwise delivered a transfer that offers superb detail, rich contrast and impressive depth. The visual allusions Ray offers are such an important part of the film, and they can finally be fully appreciated with this new HD release. Supplements include an impressive 1984 documentary on Ray, new interviews with Ray biographer Andrew Robinson and Monsoon Wedding director Mira Nair and an excerpt from a 1981 French television program featuring Ray, director Claude Sautet and critic Michael Ciment. You also get a booklet featuring an essay by Philip Kemp, an essay by Ray and an interview with Ray.""",5,One of Satyajit Ray's best films and a surprisingly tender portrait of societal change,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,1864,"['Judge', 'Clark', 'Douglas', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'Music', 'Room', 'great', 'deal', 'running', 'time', 'offering', 'elaborate', 'stagings', 'traditional', 'Indian', 'music', 'other', 'Indian', 'musicals', 'era', 'most', 'Indian', 'films', '1950s', 'relied', 'melodrama', 'exaggerated', 'acting', 'spontaneous', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'gentle', 'tale', 'works', 'musical', 'sequences', 'entirely', 'organic', 'manner', 'performances', 'built', 'understated', 'naturalism', 'Even', 'film', 'one', 'moment', 'genuine', 'melodrama', 'place', 'very', 'end', 'feels', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'believable', 'resolution', 'story', 'Ray', 'been', 'telling', 'Music', 'Room', 'affectionate', 'tale', 'struggling', 'aristocrat', 'good', 'deal', 'affection', 'know', 'doomed', 'allow', 'pride', 'take', 'lowest', 'lows', 'pity', 'know', 'must', 'either', 'increase', 'levels', 'self-delusion', 'face', 'horrors', 'reality', 'point', 'closing', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'haunting', 'beginning', 'brilliant', 'close-up', 'spider', 'lurching', 'madly', 'finish', 'line', 'there', 'original', 'print', 'was', 'damaged', 'repair', 'spots', 'constant', 'stream', 'white', 'lines', 'scratches', 'Criterion', 'otherwise', 'delivered', 'transfer', 'superb', 'detail', 'rich', 'contrast', 'impressive', 'depth', 'visual', 'allusions', 'Ray', 'offers', 'are', 'important', 'part', 'film', 'can', 'finally', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'new', 'HD', 'release', 'Supplements', 'include', 'impressive', '1984', 'documentary', 'Ray', 'new', 'interviews', 'Ray', 'biographer', 'Andrew', 'Robinson', 'Monsoon', 'Wedding', 'director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'excerpt', '1981', 'French', 'television', 'program', 'featuring', 'Ray', 'director', 'Claude', 'Sautet', 'critic', 'Michael', 'Ciment', 'also', 'get', 'booklet', 'featuring', 'essay', 'Philip', 'Kemp', 'essay', 'Ray', 'interview', 'Ray']",N/A

Finally with Jalsaghar (The Music Room)- he was on sure grounds. It is short, sweet and music overflowing. I always found Ray not using vocals (exception: Charulata's rabindrasangeet sung by Kishore) and in this case the classical compositions beautifully sung are not totally suited. I was dying to hear some more familiar tunes. The Criterion edition in Blu Ray is heavenly to look at. The depth of the scenes are amazing. It is a short story spun into a movie with hardly any additional material which is why one finishes looking at it, with a sense of unfulfillment. One would not dare criticize the great Satyajit Ray, but his sense of understatement could sometimes drive the viewers to real frustration.

It's a moving portrait about of a proud who clings to the rituals of the aristocracy as India moves into the modern world.A popular actor of his time, Chhabi Biswas plays Biswambhar Roy, a zamindar, or once a powerful feudal lord who clings to the last ratty remnant of his glory days in his crumbling mansion.  We meet him swaddled in his robes sucking on a hookah like a baby on his pacifier when he hears music from a neighbor's place that takes him back to his earlier days when he could fund lavish celebrations on his wife and sonBut alas, Roy's indulgence - his addiction -- to his passions do nothing to rescue the slow loss of his fortune as he competes with his neighbor and spends the last of his money on irrelevant displays of master artists in his beloved music room.  But what is mostly revealed is Roy's social impotence along with his false sense of entitlement and his sadly deluded sense of social superiority.  But make no mistake; this great film is also about something more than the power of music and memory in a changing culture.  It's about the conflict of living in the moment and letting go of the residue of the past.  Something exceedingly difficult for us humans no matter when or what the age in which we live.This engrossing film is Ray's best and a wonderful introduction if this director in not known to you.
