83107,A1VHK9A4VLJTHC,0788859137,"Amazon Customer ""Michael S. Beverly""","[3, 3]","Wonderful movie for the young, I strongly recommend this one for the 1 to 7 set, give or take.  The story is pretty basic, but has a deep moral underpinning, that being that other people, who may be different or scary to us, are really, most probably, just a lot more like us than we realize.  Roo becomes friends with a young heffalump, and in the process breaks down some of their, and their friends, preconceptions and prejudices.Roo and Lumpy, the young heffalump with a strange accent, are really the stars here, much of the flick surrounding their meeting and interaction, however, Pooh, Rabbit, Tigger and Piglet and others all are part of the adventure too.While the story line may sound a bit advanced, at its core, it's just a story about two young people becoming friends, and I don't think it's too advanced, because of the basic dialogue and wonderful animation, for the very young, in fact, I think kids much beyond seven or eight will probably be thinking that the movie is too immature for them.I took my almost four year old daughter to see this flick, she was a little reluctant because she wanted to see that Zebra movie again (she's seen it twice already, enough, I'll buy the dvd) but once she sat down and the Pooh movie started, she didn't move from her seat.

Not that it is an offensive movie, it is just that as an adult is not not wildly appealing to me, and certianly to one who knows the pooh books well.So getting this straight. My 4 and 2 year old love this movie - to bits. They talk about 'lumpy' and roo who are the main characters of this movie. I don't think they understand many of the main themes of it as yet but they enjoy the colours (which are pastelish mostly), the appealing drawn characters, and the music. Which is I assume why when I ask them what they want to watch they want to watch this.I really don't like it much. I think it is watchable, just. But while I really enoyed movies like Aladin which were also written with adults in mind and so is quite fun to watch. I find this excruciatingly sentimental.The story is all about a suspected Heffalump in 100 acre wood and Rabbit organising a heffalump hunt. Roo wants to take part but is too small - even if he does find the only clues to where it is. So Roo goes off on his own hunt and finds the Heffalump - clearly to be made into a soft toy of appealing softness to market with the movie. Roo and the Heffalump learn about each other's worlds and that they have both been warned about them - Lumpy is scared of the creatures in 100 acre wood, and Roo is (of course) afraid of Heffalumps. Roo takes lumpy back to meet his friends, but they aren't there. Then through problems and misunderstandings Lumpy gets trapped by the Rabbit, Piglet and co when they think he has captured Roo.Roo has an accident and falls in a large hole and it is only Lumpy, who trumpets up his mother, who saves the day.The themes of friendship, fun, sharing and understanding are very nice and I have no problem with my children learning these. It seems a shame that AA Milne's original Pooh Stories need to be 'improved' like this.Averaging out between what my kids think and what I think it rates about 4 - highly watchable for them, just bearable for me.",4,"For child this is a definite 5 for an adult a 2.5-3 -overwelmingly  cliched, commercial",1132272000,"11 18, 2005",2005,2014,"['cringe', 'watch', 'children', 'watch', 'DVD', 'yet', 'again', 'Not', 'offensive', 'movie', 'just', 'that', 'adult', 'not', 'not', 'wildly', 'appealing', 'certianly', 'one', 'who', 'pooh', 'books', 'well.So', 'getting', 'straight', '4', '2', 'year', 'old', 'love', 'movie', 'bits', 'talk', ""'lumpy"", 'roo', 'who', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'understand', 'many', 'main', 'themes', 'yet', 'enjoy', 'colours', 'are', 'pastelish', 'mostly', 'appealing', 'drawn', 'characters', 'music', 'Which', 'assume', 'why', 'when', 'ask', 'what', 'want', 'watch', 'want', 'watch', 'this.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'think', 'watchable', 'just', 'really', 'enoyed', 'movies', 'Aladin', 'were', 'also', 'written', 'adults', 'mind', 'so', 'quite', 'fun', 'watch', 'find', 'excruciatingly', 'sentimental.The', 'story', 'suspected', 'Heffalump', '100', 'acre', 'wood', 'Rabbit', 'organising', 'heffalump', 'hunt', 'Roo', 'take', 'part', 'too', 'small', 'even', 'find', 'only', 'clues', 'where', 'So', 'Roo', 'off', 'own', 'hunt', 'Heffalump', 'clearly', 'be', 'made', 'soft', 'toy', 'appealing', 'softness', 'market', 'movie', 'Roo', 'Heffalump', 'learn', 'other', 'worlds', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'Lumpy', 'scared', 'creatures', '100', 'acre', 'wood', 'Roo', 'course', 'afraid', 'Heffalumps', 'Roo', 'lumpy', 'back', 'meet', 'friends', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'Then', 'problems', 'misunderstandings', 'Lumpy', 'trapped', 'Rabbit', 'Piglet', 'co', 'when', 'think', 'captured', 'Roo.Roo', 'accident', 'large', 'hole', 'only', 'Lumpy', 'who', 'up', 'mother', 'who', 'day.The', 'themes', 'friendship', 'fun', 'sharing', 'understanding', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'have', 'problem', 'children', 'learning', 'shame', 'AA', 'Milne', 'original', 'Pooh', 'Stories', 'need', 'be', ""'improved"", 'this.Averaging', 'out', 'what', 'kids', 'think', 'what', 'think', 'rates', '4', 'highly', 'watchable', 'just', 'bearable']",N/A

It is even good for adults, as it is full of humor, that even we can enjoy!The plot of the Pooh movie is that the Hundred Acre Woods crew hear a loud SCARY noise in the middle of the night so they go to Rabbits house--as Rabbit knows everything, and Rabbit tells them it is a Heffalump...and they all get scared.  Rabbit tells them they will go look for the Heffalump in the morning, but that Roo cannot join them. Roo who wants to go, decides to go out early in the morning, hunting for a Heffalump on his own.  When into the woods of the Heffalump he has to stop to get his rope that has fallen into the river and when he turns to leave his food is gone!  Where did it go?  Roo hears a noise in the weeds and goes to check it out-when he does he finds Lumpy.  Who informs Roo that he is a Heffalump. He also tells Roo that all the people in the Hundred Acre Woods scare him because one is pink and shakes a lot and the other is always bouncing and shouting-so each is scared of each other. Roo and Lumpy become quick friends and help each other get over their stereotypes.  But, the Hundred Acre Woods crew are still on the hunt and they will soon encounter Lumpy and Roo and the two young ones will teach even the older crew a lesson that is great for all.I think even us ""older"" people who watch the movie learn a lesson--as we are just as good, if not better than kids, on making judgments based on assumptions.  I think everyone who watches this movie falls in love with Lumpy and Roo and the lesson they teach us all.  It is one that you will not get bored by and a movie that you can enjoy with the family which is extremely important these days!  I recommend going and seeing this and also purchasing the DVD later.

Roo is ultimately the catalyst of change in the film and carries the day very well.In my opinion Pooh's Heffalump movie surpasses Piglet's big movie as the 2nd best Pooh movie of all time (Nothing in my mind will ever supplant The many of adventures of Winnie the Pooh as the best film in all of Poohdom).  Not to give anything away, but I would encourage everyone who sees the movie to stay and watch the closing credits as there is a wonderful homage to Many Adventures that was laugh out loud funny.As we were leaving the theatre my kids were already lobbying (no pun intended) to see the film again and again.

The heart of the movie is about their friendship and how each one grows from that experience.  My 4 year old daughter has been enjoying this movie for a year.  And I enjoyed the chance to share and talk about it with her.My daughter really relates to it and gets into the story.  I'm thankful she has a movie that seems to be aimed at her age group.  She especially enjoys singing along during the main song, ""Shoulder to Shoulder"".  And she likes to sing the lullaby ""Little Mister Roo"" too.  I remember Carly Simon's work in the 70's but I am very grateful to her for her work on this and Piglet's BIG Movie.This film is not perfect though.  People who are really into Milne's original work will likely be disappointed.  But the adult viewer is not the main targeted audience.Some reviewers writing about ""mixed messages"" have very valid points, but some of the points are off target.  For example, Lumpy doesn't go to his mom when she first calls, but we do see him pay a severe price for that in the sad emotions he feels while he looks for her.  My daughter shed a few tears when Lumpy missed his ""mummy"".  Obviously I talk about these scenes with my daughter.  She understands the scenes yet it isn't traumatic for her and this plot device holds her attention.My daughter knows that these are animated, pretend characters on the screen and while she can relate to the fun the friends have together, this movie does not supply her with an inspiring role model.  Perhaps that is just her personality or perhaps some reviewers are a little overboard on that point.I found the extra features only moderately interesting and my daughter only likes to look occasionally at the game.The exuberance far outshines the sad parts of the movie.

Like they say in the movie, you don't catch a Heffalump, he catches you.Roo wakes up one morning, hearing a strange noise, as Pooh, Rabbit and Tigger discover strange tracks in their portion of the Hundred Acre Wood. When Rabbit convinces everyone that they are under seige from a faceless race of Heffalumps who threaten their peace, prosperity, and very way of life (I'm sure this is sounding familiar by now) all the friends of Pooh corner begin training to go and catch the Heffalump. Roo is banned from the search because he's too small - but sets out on his own, armed with only a half-notion of what he's looking for.What he finds is not what he expects: a heffalump that isn't fierce or ferocious and doesn't have a spiky tail, but a creature just like Roo's young self who gets scared, likes treats and playing games, and has to come when his mother calls. Roo's bravery and tenacity win the day, and everyone makes a new friend.Apart from the usual cast, including the amazing Jim Cummings as both Pooh and Tigger (which is no easy feat!) Kyle Stanger's vocal characterization of Lumpy is absolutely excellent - both childlike and adorable without becoming saccharine or stagey. The art and animation both rise to the level of Pinnochio and Hayao Miyazaki's excellent ""Spirited Away"" - a welcome surprise of quality from the company who invented the standard, but who also have produced more formulaic,  half-baked and poorly rendered work than anyone else. The amount of craft put into The Heffalump movie really brings you back to the level of quality that Disney is famous for.And parents -  I've watched this movie with my daughter at least 20 times, and I'm still finding things to look at and enjoy every time. It really holds up well.

The title notwithstanding, the film does a good job following the pair as they overcome misperceptions and differences to form a bond with one another. The songs are decent enough as well, with a couple numbers by Carly Simon, one of my favorite singers, featuring prominently. The few problems I have with the film stem from some of the characterizations. At one point, Pooh blames a Heffalump for making him do something he says he did not want to do, which is not really keeping with Pooh's character. Also, Pooh, Tigger, et al tie up Lumpy in a mistaken effort to rescue Roo from him. Even though they set out at the onset to capture a Heffalump, they are suddenly the villains of the movie when they bind Lumpy. This can be more than a little disconcerting for a youngster, who has always regarded Pooh as the infallible protagonist. Nonetheless, my two year old loves this movie and has watched it at least a dozen times since I bought it three days ago. It is also good enough that parents won't mind its repeated play either.",3,Roo's Heffalump movie,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,1380,"['pretty', 'good', 'little', 'movie', 'even', 'title', 'little', 'misleading', 'Pooh', 'short', 'while', 'primarily', 'about', 'little', 'Roo', 'burgeoning', 'relationship', 'Lumpy', 'young', 'Heffalump', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Roo', 'Heffalump', 'Movie', 'suppose', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'recognizable', 'enough', 'marketers', 'title', 'notwithstanding', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'following', 'pair', 'overcome', 'misperceptions', 'differences', 'form', 'bond', 'one', 'songs', 'are', 'decent', 'enough', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'numbers', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'one', 'favorite', 'singers', 'featuring', 'prominently', 'few', 'problems', 'have', 'film', 'stem', 'characterizations', 'one', 'point', 'Pooh', 'Heffalump', 'making', 'do', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'keeping', 'Pooh', 'character', 'Also', 'Pooh', 'Tigger', 'et', 'al', 'up', 'Lumpy', 'mistaken', 'effort', 'rescue', 'Roo', 'Even', 'set', 'out', 'onset', 'capture', 'Heffalump', 'are', 'suddenly', 'villains', 'movie', 'when', 'bind', 'Lumpy', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'youngster', 'who', 'always', 'regarded', 'Pooh', 'infallible', 'protagonist', 'Nonetheless', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'movie', 'watched', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'bought', 'three', 'days', 'ago', 'also', 'good', 'enough', 'parents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'repeated', 'play']",N/A

83148,A15H0OGLXJ9FC6,0788859137,T. R. Rak,"[0, 0]","At first, I was uncertain about ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie.""  I was concerned about ""corporate Disney's"" EXPLOTAITIVE (read: $$$ for Disney) taking of liberties with A. A. Milne's original theme and vision, of ""Whimsical Life in the 100 Acre Wood,"" an epic allegory suitable for children (first and foremost!), but ALSO with a lot of homespun wisdom for ""grownup kids"" to appreciate too; with its bevy of intricately-well-drawn characters, all of whom were ""real"" imaginary (stuffed animal) friends of the VERY REAL son of Mr. Milne, namely Christopher Robin Milne, beginning when he was about 6 years old and onwards.  These ""Friends of Christopher and the 100 Acre Wood"" had always been constant, unchanging, ever since the first (of two) Winnie-the-Pooh books was published in London, the original (red, hard-cover book) in 1926, then the second one in 1928 (both of which have never, NOT ONCE, been out of print to this VERY day!), both rife with wonder and magical adventures penned in that inimitable, laugh-out-loud though STRATEGICALLY understated (read: UNPARALLELED BEST-of-BRITISH ""HUMOUR!"") style unequaled by the overwhelmingly talented Mr. Milne; and the rest (they say) is ""History"" - written LARGE and ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL (read: economically so), even well within Milne's own life and, for better AND WORSE - that of his eponymous and only child Christopher Robin and Christopher's ""creatively WELL-PERSONIFIED buddies"":  There's Winnie the Pooh (of course, Our Central Hero); Piglet (Pooh's Best Friend and Constant Companion in Adventure); Christopher Robin (obviously; the ONLY HUMAN, and quite often - Our Reliable ""Savior"" - come the denouement of MANY [if not MOST] of Winnie-the-Pooh's stories, both in Volume 1 and then - ""House at Pooh Corner,"" aka Volume 2); and all the rest of the merry bunch - Rabbit (logical, though a ""bit"" manic/obsessive/nervous-to-say-the-least); Kanga (Every Loving Mother's ""Every Mom""); Roo (Kanga's Beloved Son; happy and carefree); Eeyore (poor dear fellow; if there was ever a case for ""animal psychiatry and/or psychology,"" Eeyore is MOST UNEQUIVOCALLY - The DEFINITIVE, Classically Original CLINICALLY-DEPRESSED DONKEY!); Tigger (""bouncy, trouncy, bouncy, trouncy, fun fun fun fun fun!  Perhaps though, Not Ivy League's next ""scholarship-ready shoe-in"" - yuk yuk yuk!  And ALL the BETTER for THAT, eh?  he he he ...); and then, there's good old Owl (""wise"" or rather, ""what wisdom LACKS!"" - A. A. Milne's IRONIC commentary anthropomorphically ""personified"" on the subject - albeit ""self knowledge"" never quite clear, let alone accessible, unto Owl himself [naturally!  ""Whoooooooooo ... Me?""]).But I was wrong.  Cynical, stupid and wrong.  Always gunning for the ""money angle.""  And dead wrong - This movie is a GEM!  Because: Pooh fans everywhere are NOT a cynical bunch; just ""POOH-SMART,"" which is to say - SMART IN WAYS UNFAMILIAR TO *M*O*S*T* HUMAN BEINGS.""Lumpy,"" the star heffalump in our movie under review here, is a deeply-British-accented, albeit QUINTESSENTIALLY LOVEABLE elephantine ""pup,"" who lives ""just over the fence"" from the 100 Acre Wood.  One day Roo sets out, after hearing a strange trumpeting noise in the night (said noise belonging to, as we later learn, ""Mrs. Heffalump,"" Lumpy's ""mum;"" whilst Pooh, Rabbit, Piglet and Tigger are all ""a-scurry"" worried about phantom heffalump fears, preparing traps, ambushes, and all sorts of ""strategies gone agley to rid the world of 'the Evil heffalump SCOURGE'"" [read:  Homeland Security]; but Roo - the child WITHOUT prejudices, sans adult fears, without a shred of anger, rage nor foolish biases - playfully and fearlessly ""crosses the fence,"" and in so doing, discovers a new world, and a new and AWESOME friend (with a built-in-""trunk;"" so he's ALWAYS ready to tromp-travel ""the life fantastic"") - and ergo Lumpy turns out to become:  Roo's EXOTIC Best Friend in the WORLD *BEYOND* - the insular 100-Acre ""Wood Trap.""I won't spoil the fun further, except to add what makes this animated feature EXTRA DELIGHTFUL:  Marvelously infectious music and SINGABLE songs with Golden-tonsiled, Mega-Famous Carly Simon at the helm (at first I thought it was the dulcet-toned Anne Murray; wrong again, twas I, though Murray would have turned in a brilliant performance too!) backed by a remarkably talented children's chorale; lyrically engaging pieces; melodically catchy sing-a-longs, and altogether inspired numbers!  The movie is worth enjoying for its MAGNIFICENT MUSICAL accompaniments alone!The animation here is just fine.  Quality, not flawless, but WAY GOOD ENOUGH!  (Often I refer back to this famous quote by one of my all-time renowned philosophic geniuses, whose name I'll protect for reasons of privacy preferred:  ""Practice makes Perfect, as All Practice Should, Unless THE PERFECT BECOMES:  The ENEMY, of The Good!"")  ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"" employs the classic two-dimensional animation technology (immortalized by Disney's ""Fantasia,"" amongst DOZENS of other Disney-defined classics including ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Lion King,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Mulan,"" ""The Princess and the Frog"" and MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE ..., which I find divinely refreshing in the BEST ""old fashioned"" fashion, amidst Post-Post-Post-Post-Modren (sp. intentional - ""Modren"" - cf. artist-light-years-ahead-of-his-age, ""Mr. Dennis DeYoung"") Day's ""Race to 3D Imagery"" which, often enough ATTEMPTS to subjugate story (read: lack thereof] by cloying special fx.  There are a handful of PRIME Exceptional EXCEPTIONS - where ""The Story"" is ENHANCED by ""Avant-garde Technology;"" such as - The ineffable James Cameron's Incomparable Feat of Cinematic Magickal Genius, EVERY FRAME IN KEEPING WITH THE ""POOH WHIMSICAL, PHILOSOPHY OF INTEGRITY"" - 2009's Best Film and arguably, BEST FILM OF THE THIRD MILLENNIUM A.D. THUS FAR:  ""Avatar.""  But ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"" is naturally, a ""little bit different,"" by budget and by intention at a minimum, so it is BEST *NOT* to compare it to MEGA-BUDGET box-office cinema - except by reference to ""the pursuit of integral quality and virtues!""  Hence ...At a modest Hour and 8 minutes in Length, this Gorgeous Little Animated Feature is JUST LONG ENOUGH TO *WILLINGLY* *SUSPEND* *YOUR* (natural, if anything similar to my own) *DISBELIEF*, Intelligent Cineaste, yet without snapping said disbelief in twain, and JUST *SHORT* ENOUGH - not to ""jump the shark,"" so to speak.  In summary, thanks to Disney, I can now, all cynicism assuaged, confidently call out to All Winnie the Pooh Aficionados:  LONG LIVE HEFFALUMPS!Rent or buy ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"" today.  Children and their Parents ALIKE - will *NOT* be disappointed - but GLADLY embrace ""heffalumps"" as ""the new critters on the block"" in that ever-so-happy, ever-so-non-judgmental, WONDROUS, UNPREJUDICED WORLD of A.A.

VanPool,"[10, 18]","I absolutely love watching movies with my two sons, because it gives us a chance to talk about social strategies and proper behavior while having a great time. We have a family time, laugh, eat popcorn, and giggle.  Most movies are ideal for this, especially those such as Thomas the Tank Engine, Bob the Builder, and the Wiggles.Pooh's Heffalump Movie unfortunately conveys absolutely the wrong messages.  The story revolves around Roo and Lumpy disobeying their mothers' calls to return home.  The children end up OK, but are placed in danger many times over.  However, the danger is always the result of others and there is no, absolutely NO, recognition of the negative consequences resulting from their own behavior.  The mothers eventually find them and everything is Ok, but there is no corrective for the children placing themselves or others at risk.Throughout the movie, I had to explain to my children that the movie was fiction, and that the real world doesn't work that way.  I had to explain how children could become lost and injured, and that parents call for their children to keep them safe.  Further, I had to stress what Roo and Lumpy SHOULD have done, not what they did.  The movie at no point helped me out in trying to teach good behavior.The supposed moral story of the movie is a simplistic notion that people who are different aren't dangerous.  This is a fine notion, but it isn't eloquently presented. Plus, it isn't always true, as illustrated by the fact that Rabbit, Tiger, Pooh, and Piglet pose a very real threat to Lumpy as they try to violently capture him.  (Yes, in this movie Pooh is a villain.)The truth be known, the movie wasn't entertaining even if one overlooks the problem of the characters' behavior.  The laugh quotient was particularly low.All in all, the movie wasn't particularly enjoyable, and absolutely wasn't useful as an instructive tool.
