819508,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B0001ZZ4OG,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 1]","""Fleetwood Mac- Unbroken Chain"" is a boring, disappointing documentary about Fleetwood Mac. While it is mildly interesting discussing the band's origins as Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, to how one of the band members joined the Family of God--it really doesn't shed as much as light as it should. There are no interviews with Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, who were important to the band's ""California sound."" There are some former bandmates, some from such groups as Chicken Shack. The love affairs between band members gets briefly dabbled in.Rumours (Deluxe Edition)is discussed as the ultimate soap opera concept album. The weirdness is that instead of interviewing band members--they interview the leaders of Fleetwood Mac's UK fan club(!!!)It's frustrating to hear people discuss the group's blues era before Christine McVie and Buckingham/Nicks, without the music being played. Since ""Rumours"" is talked about, it's sad that none of its songs are played. Ironically, it's easier to hear Fleetwood Mac songs on soft rock/soft pop stations than in this documentary. Another irony is that Fleetwood Mac's producer for ""Rumours"" and ""Tusk"" is also the father of a new diva of the California sound, Colbie Caillat (Coco,Breakthrough) Stevie Nicks went into an independent career of her own.""Unbroken Chain"" is a disappointing waste of time.",2,Broken Chord,1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,1347,"['Fleetwood', 'Mac-', 'Unbroken', 'Chain', 'boring', 'disappointing', 'documentary', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'discussing', 'band', 'origins', 'Peter', 'Green', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'how', 'one', 'band', 'members', 'joined', 'Family', 'God', 'really', ""n't"", 'shed', 'as', 'much', 'light', 'should', 'are', 'interviews', 'Lindsey', 'Buckingham', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'who', 'were', 'important', 'band', 'California', 'sound', 'are', 'former', 'bandmates', 'such', 'groups', 'Chicken', 'Shack', 'love', 'affairs', 'band', 'members', 'briefly', 'dabbled', 'in.Rumours', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'discussed', 'ultimate', 'soap', 'opera', 'concept', 'album', 'weirdness', 'instead', 'interviewing', 'band', 'members', 'interview', 'leaders', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'UK', 'fan', 'club', 'frustrating', 'hear', 'people', 'discuss', 'group', 'blues', 'era', 'Christine', 'McVie', 'Buckingham/Nicks', 'music', 'being', 'played', 'Rumours', 'talked', 'sad', 'none', 'songs', 'are', 'played', 'Ironically', 'easier', 'hear', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'songs', 'soft', 'rock/soft', 'pop', 'stations', 'documentary', 'irony', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'producer', 'Rumours', 'Tusk', 'also', 'father', 'new', 'diva', 'California', 'sound', 'Colbie', 'Caillat', 'Coco', 'Breakthrough', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'went', 'independent', 'career', 'own', 'Unbroken', 'Chain', 'disappointing', 'waste', 'time']",N/A
