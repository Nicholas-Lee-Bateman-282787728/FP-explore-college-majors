1051630,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000MX7V4S,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[72, 72]","A terrier dog named Bobby, known since the mid 1800's in Edinburgh as ""Greyfriars Bobby"" has a monument to his devotion to his master.  His story is one of love, unwavering loyalty, determination, and dog charm.  Bobby became the hero and object of affection to a city, old and young, rich and poor, all united to forever keep the story of such a magnificent dog alive forever.Bobby was nothing but a small Skye Terrier who was so devoted to his master that he could not stand to be away from his grave after the funeral. Bobby's story is of the extreme measures needed to be taken to remain atop the grave of the man he loved. The cemetery allowed no dogs.This version, ""THE ADVENTURES OF GREYFRIARS BOBBY"" is a bit more accurate to the true Scotland events than the much acclaimed Walt Disney version titled ""Greyfriars Bobby"", the same title as the book by Indiana's author of youth books, Eleanor Atkinson. See my reviews of both the Disney DVD and the book. Both are recommended at 5 stars, just like this DVD version.This newer release, has some really fantastic music. The scenery of the film is as good as any Scotland travelogue could provide. The tale is as heartwarming as any could be written--AND REMEMBER--this is a TRUE story, not fiction.  I fell in love with Bobby.Greyfriars Bobby will live on in the lives of the people of Edinburgh forever.  It will in your mind and heart as well as soon as you watch one or more of the versions of this fine dog-devotion story.  It makes no difference if you do it movie style or by reading.  I recommend both.This is one fantastic childrens' gift, although adults will enjoy it completely as well.  For the very young, I might suggest the Disney version DVD, as it shows a little less peril.  And Disney decided to end the story prior to Bobby's death.YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.

Being of U.K. descent,you grow up with the story of ""Greyfriar's Bobby"" with all of it's morphings, so much so, that it is hard to know just where the legend let's off and the truth begins! Hence my difficulty here,because this is yet another version based on the story of the little Scottish Skye Terrier who would not leave his Master's grave site in Edinburgh for 11 to 14 years (depending on which wee legend tickles your fancy!). Anyhow, John Henderson (The Borrowers,Heroes & Villians: The Last EnglishmanandLoch Nesswho co-wrote and directed this version has a fairly saccharine Disneyesque approach that puts me in mind ofThe Three Lives of Thomasina....just so perfect,and squeaky clean and predictable, that it will work for kids, but not really grabbing at an adult audience like the more recent factual/fantasyThe Water Horse - Legend of the Deep (Two-Disc Special Edition)did with more character development and frankly more down to earth characters.A wee bit on the frivolous side for my tastes, but young children should enjoy learning the lessons that a loyal dog has for it's owner.Do not take this film as truth...especially since Henderson chose a Westie over a Skye Terrier (which Bobby really was!).NOTE: America gets it's mold for ""Lassie"" and ""Rin Tin Tin"" from this story.NO DVD EXTRAS.",3,"Ideal for children to get the point across on ""Greyfriar's Bobby""",1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,1330,"['Where', 'start', 'Being', 'U.K.', 'descent', 'grow', 'up', 'story', 'Greyfriar', 'Bobby', 'morphings', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'hard', 'know', 'just', 'where', 'legend', 'let', 'off', 'truth', 'Hence', 'difficulty', 'here', 'yet', 'version', 'based', 'story', 'little', 'Scottish', 'Skye', 'Terrier', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'leave', 'Master', 'grave', 'site', 'Edinburgh', '11', '14', 'years', 'depending', 'wee', 'legend', 'fancy', 'Anyhow', 'John', 'Henderson', 'Borrowers', 'Heroes', 'Villians', 'Last', 'EnglishmanandLoch', 'Nesswho', 'co-wrote', 'directed', 'version', 'fairly', 'saccharine', 'Disneyesque', 'approach', 'mind', 'ofThe', 'Three', 'Lives', 'Thomasina', '.just', 'so', 'perfect', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'predictable', 'will', 'work', 'kids', 'not', 'really', 'grabbing', 'adult', 'audience', 'more', 'recent', 'factual/fantasyThe', 'Water', 'Horse', 'Legend', 'Deep', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'did', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'frankly', 'more', 'down', 'earth', 'characters.A', 'wee', 'bit', 'frivolous', 'side', 'tastes', 'young', 'children', 'should', 'enjoy', 'learning', 'lessons', 'loyal', 'dog', 'owner.Do', 'not', 'take', 'film', 'truth', 'especially', 'Henderson', 'chose', 'Westie', 'Skye', 'Terrier', 'Bobby', 'really', 'was', '.NOTE', 'America', 'mold', 'Lassie', 'Rin', 'Tin', 'Tin', 'story.NO', 'DVD', 'EXTRAS']",Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby

1051636,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000MX7V4S,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Greyfriars Bobby(released Oct/05)attempts to tell the story of the legendary Greyfriars Bobby,the Skye Terrier that became a legend in its day for not leaving its dead masters graveside.Some residents claim the dog NEVER left the cemetery,reports have it living for 18 years and it was owned by a shepherd,then a policeman.It would be foolish to think a dog would never leave one spot for its entire life and would have to have at least been fed by cemetery personnel or passerbys.Jan Bondeson in his 2011 book on Bobby feels he was a stray who was ""adopted"" by the man who ran the cemetery,a Mr.Brown.As word spread so did the tourists who would pay to hear the story from Mr.Brown himself.It is also debatable whether the dog was owned by a shepherd or a policeman,as Skye Terriers are used more for ratting,not for herding,nor would it be used by a policeman as a dog to assist in his work,because of its short stature.The fact it supposedly lived 18 years is another myth.Skye's do not live more than 12 years and the author examined pictures of Bobby,and after a period there was a definite change in appearances from a scraggly looking Skye to a more youthful and well kept one.It is surmised there were actually two Bobbies,to keep the mythos alive and well.It was a boon for tourism and income for the city treasuries.There were many citizens that came forward many times over the years to counter the Bobby legend,but like most such things they tend to take on a life of their own and it is hard to debunk them once they have grown legs.The film itself has a West Highland Terrier as its' star.So right there the movie,regardless of its liberties with the actual facts,has got it wrong right from the get go,with its main character not even of the same breed.The story here starts off as we find Bobby in the care of a policeman,John Gray.The cop dies and Bobby starts to frequent his old masters plot.After time the graveyard attendant starts feeding him and Bobby is used to catch rats there to earn his keep.Mrs.Gray is forced to move away and takes Bobby with her,but he yearns for Edinburgh and his masters gravesite.One day she lets him go and he travels back on his own.There are two businessmen in town who do not want Bobby around,thinking him a stray and a nuisance.Bobbie's story has become legendary and while most citizens consider him a charge of all of them,the laws soon change and he is rounded up with other strays and set to be poisoned.A local Lord(Christopher Lee) comes to the rescue and Bobby finally has the freedom of Edinburgh in an official ceremony.The film ends with Bobbie's end who was buried with his master.The latter is yet another mistake as Bobby was not allowed to be buried in the graveyard proper.He is buried just inside the main gate of the church yard.One has to constantly ignore the accuracy of this film and just concentrate on the story being presented.Unfortunately the story is not at all that well done.Within 20 minutes of the film's beginning the policeman is dead and soon after Bobby is sitting on his old masters grave.However the previous 20 minutes have NOT established a proper bond between Bobby and his master that would cause the terrier to sit upon his masters grave as he does for so long.Instead the makers,for whatever reason,concentrated more on development of the human characters instead;go figure.And of course,like so many animal pictures,Bobby is given human attributes.For example,at one point he is trying cross a fallen tree over a river and eventually plunges in.I own a Westie and I know she'd be over that tree and across like no ones business.But here Bobby has to be overly cautious,even going down to its belly as it slips and slides its way along.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r and is clear and crisp.No extras are to be found.All in all a disappointment all around.An uneven story,coupled with an inaccurate account of Bobbie's story,gives us a film which is passable and that's all.Like author Bondeson suggests,there will probably never be an accurate account,a REAL story of the Bobby of Greyfriars.Legend is always better,and more profitable,than fact.",3,Historically inaccurate account of the famous dog of Greyfriars,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,4163,"['Greyfriars',
