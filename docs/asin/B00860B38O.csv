1547111,A2WDWI8SM8DNUT,B00860B38O,"D. Ryan Mowry ""Ryan's Reviews""","[16, 16]","Condensed from Ryan's Reviews, [...]In the world of FS, there is a new disease known as the Amnesia Plague that is wreaking havoc.  First you are confused and disoriented, and then you slip into hallucinations and delusions, followed by a full psychotic breakdown, and finally collective consciousness, which pretty much looks like hoards of zombies.  Luis has escaped the collective hoards in the city of Albuquerque and is wandering the outlying area looking for his lost wife Cassandra.  He stumbles upon a home that is actually not abandoned, and meets the residents: Mommy, Daddy, Grandpa, and Sister aka Cassandra.  To Luis' disappointment, Cassandra does not remember him.Of course, things couldn't be that easy.  Daddy is a religious zealot who believes that the Amnesia Plague is the beginning of the End of Days, Mommy is pretty much off her rocker, and Cassandra not only doesn't remember Luis, she also can seemingly see the future.  Out in the wilds there is the growing fear of Amnesiacs; some just stand and stare off into the nothingness, while others attack the uninfected and attempt to consume them like any other zombie movie.  It's the ones that stare that creep me out the most, and it seems that this is the breakdown before they turn hungry.So overall it probably sounds a lot like most other zombie movies you've seen, I realize.  Then there is that notion of Cassandra seeing the future, and therefore being able to change the future that makes this story veer off the standard zombie path.  The plot seems pretty straightforward for about the first half of the film, and then things escalate.  Daddy gets crazier, Mommy gets crazier, the danger outside grows more ominous, and then FS starts messing with your head.  Bits and pieces of the story are out of order - they always have been a little off right from the beginning, but the gaps become wider, the flow of time more convoluted.  I don't want to get too much into how FS plays with plot and its unfolding, because I don't want to give away too much, but let's just put it this way: if you're not paying enough attention you're gonna get lost (and even if you are paying attention you might STILL be a bit confused).  I really enjoyed this take on restructuring the zombie film; as a genre, zombie movies are most often a straight line from beginning to end, but FS zigs and zags, twists and turns, and the further on the story gets the harder it is to define the path it has taken to get there.  I like a movie that challenges me, and find it refreshing to find this sort of subterfuge in a relatively straightforward genre.Overall I found FS to be an interesting entry into the flesh-eater canon of films.  It's not completely different than anything you've ever seen, but it is certainly not just your average zombie movie.  The twists on time and vision and reality were a really fun way to spin what would otherwise be a pretty average story.  The skill with which the film was produced and shot add a lot to the weight the story carries, and overall FS does a really good job at distressing the emotions of the audience without having to pour out buckets of the red stuff.  This is one of those movies that lends itself to multiple viewings, and I think the twists in the plotline will become easier to follow once you've seen it the first time.  And I love movies that I can watch more than once.For the full review, see here:[...]",4,Ryan's Review for Fugue State,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,3422,"['Condensed', 'Ryan', 'Reviews', '[', ']', 'world', 'FS', 'new', 'disease', 'known', 'Amnesia', 'Plague', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'First', 'are', 'confused', 'disoriented', 'then', 'slip', 'hallucinations', 'delusions', 'followed', 'full', 'psychotic', 'breakdown', 'finally', 'collective', 'consciousness', 'pretty', 'much', 'looks', 'hoards', 'zombies', 'Luis', 'escaped', 'collective', 'hoards', 'city', 'Albuquerque', 'wandering', 'outlying', 'area', 'looking', 'lost', 'wife', 'Cassandra', 'home', 'actually', 'not', 'abandoned', 'residents', 'Mommy', 'Daddy', 'Grandpa', 'Sister', 'aka', 'Cassandra', 'Luis', 'disappointment', 'Cassandra', 'not', 'remember', 'him.Of', 'course', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'Daddy', 'religious', 'zealot', 'who', 'Amnesia', 'Plague', 'beginning', 'End', 'Days', 'Mommy', 'pretty', 'much', 'rocker', 'Cassandra', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Luis', 'also', 'can', 'seemingly', 'see', 'future', 'wilds', 'growing', 'fear', 'Amnesiacs', 'just', 'stand', 'stare', 'off', 'nothingness', 'others', 'attack', 'uninfected', 'attempt', 'consume', 'other', 'zombie', 'movie', 'ones', 'stare', 'creep', 'out', 'most', 'breakdown', 'turn', 'hungry.So', 'probably', 'lot', 'most', 'other', 'zombie', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'realize', 'Then', 'notion', 'Cassandra', 'seeing', 'future', 'therefore', 'being', 'able', 'change', 'future', 'story', 'veer', 'standard', 'zombie', 'path', 'plot', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'then', 'things', 'escalate', 'Daddy', 'crazier', 'Mommy', 'crazier', 'danger', 'outside', 'more', 'ominous', 'then', 'FS', 'messing', 'head', 'Bits', 'pieces', 'story', 'are', 'order', 'always', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'off', 'right', 'beginning', 'gaps', 'become', 'wider', 'flow', 'time', 'more', 'convoluted', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'how', 'FS', 'plot', 'unfolding', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'let', 'just', 'put', 'way', ""'re"", 'not', 'paying', 'enough', 'attention', ""'re"", 'gon', 'get', 'lost', 'even', 'are', 'paying', 'attention', 'might', 'STILL', 'be', 'bit', 'confused', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'take', 'restructuring', 'zombie', 'film', 'genre', 'zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'most', 'often', 'straight', 'line', 'beginning', 'end', 'FS', 'zigs', 'zags', 'twists', 'turns', 'further', 'story', 'harder', 'define', 'path', 'taken', 'get', 'there', 'like', 'movie', 'find', 'refreshing', 'find', 'sort', 'subterfuge', 'relatively', 'straightforward', 'genre.Overall', 'found', 'FS', 'be', 'interesting', 'entry', 'flesh-eater', 'canon', 'films', 'not', 'completely', 'different', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'certainly', 'not', 'just', 'average', 'zombie', 'movie', 'twists', 'time', 'vision', 'reality', 'were', 'really', 'fun', 'way', 'spin', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'pretty', 'average', 'story', 'skill', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'shot', 'add', 'lot', 'weight', 'story', 'overall', 'FS', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'distressing', 'emotions', 'audience', 'having', 'pour', 'out', 'buckets', 'red', 'stuff', 'one', 'movies', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'think', 'twists', 'plotline', 'will', 'become', 'easier', 'follow', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'time', 'love', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'more', 'once.For', 'full', 'review', 'see', 'here', '[', ']']",N/A
