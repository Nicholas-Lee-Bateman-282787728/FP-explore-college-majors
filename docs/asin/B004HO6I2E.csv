1408899,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004HO6I2E,A kids review,"[11, 21]","Ah, the classic body-switch movie, a staple of screwball comedy. That well never quite runs dry, but every once in a while it does pump out some rancid sewage and try to pass itself on as San Pellegrino. Unfortunately for all those involved, The Change-Up ended up resembling the former rather than the latter. The premise is all too familiar: longtime buddies Mitch, a swinging bachelor, and Dave, a married lawyer with kids, have grown to become polar opposites of each other, and each of them envies the other's lot in life. When a freak accident causes them to switch bodies, they learn that the grass isn't necessarily always greener on the other side. Sound predictable and formulaic? That's what I thought, too. Though there's some fun to be had in watching both Reynolds and Bateman play against type, the conceit wears thin quickly, and there just isn't enough left in the script to make the film memorable. At 1 star, The Change-Up is a missed opportunity to do something fun with a familiar premise, and the talented cast is all it has going for it.",1,The Change-Up,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,1060,"['Ah', 'classic', 'body-switch', 'movie', 'staple', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'well', 'never', 'quite', 'dry', 'once', 'while', 'pump', 'out', 'rancid', 'sewage', 'try', 'pass', 'San', 'Pellegrino', 'Unfortunately', 'involved', 'Change-Up', 'ended', 'up', 'resembling', 'former', 'rather', 'latter', 'premise', 'too', 'familiar', 'longtime', 'buddies', 'Mitch', 'swinging', 'bachelor', 'Dave', 'married', 'lawyer', 'kids', 'have', 'grown', 'become', 'polar', 'opposites', 'other', 'other', 'lot', 'life', 'When', 'freak', 'accident', 'switch', 'bodies', 'learn', 'grass', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'always', 'greener', 'other', 'side', 'Sound', 'predictable', 'formulaic', 'what', 'thought', 'too', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'watching', 'Reynolds', 'Bateman', 'play', 'type', 'conceit', 'wears', 'thin', 'quickly', 'there', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'left', 'script', 'make', 'film', 'memorable', '1', 'star', 'Change-Up', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'do', 'something', 'fun', 'familiar', 'premise', 'talented', 'cast', 'going']",N/A

It's not possible that their behaviors would have been tolerated by others.

1408909,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004HO6I2E,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","The Change-Up is an example where the length of the movie was the biggest problem.  Two hours that surely should have been trimmed to less than 80.  You see when the humor was on, it was REALLY on and I was laughing extremely hard (such as the babysititng segment and the way Ryan Reynolds' character was holding the kids while running down the stairs and then setting them on the counter only to discover that the babies were ready to stick their heads in a nearby outlet or throw knives at Ryan's head).  THESE were great moments.  In fact any segment that focused on the babies was really memorable.  I was sort of weirded out whenever the one baby would frequently smack his head against the side of the crib because the film would sort of speed up, lol.The problem is that the humor is frequently sacrificed for romance that simply doesn't work, or rather (in the case of Ryan's character) feels totally tacked on when, for example, Ryan's character eventually falls in love with Olivia Wilde's character and it all just seemed TOTALLY pointless to me.  I truly don't understand why that entire segment was even necessary to be included.The storyline is that the always funny Jason Bateman (best actor by FAR in the movie) and Ryan Reynolds urinate and make a wish in a water fountain and when morning arrives they discover that they've been switched so Ryan's immature/silly personality is inside Jason's body, and Jason's professional/serious character is inside Ryan's.  The consequences are often unusual but sometimes they work (such as the segment when both Jason and Ryan were sitting in the living room and trying to convince Jason's wife that they've exchanged bodies and the wife laughing it off as a stupid joke).Another really annoying aspect is the way the characters would just blurt out REALLY obnoxious swear words.  This was totally unnecessary and certainly doesn't constitute quality writing.  Lots of nudity too.Again though, the movie is overlong by at least 30 minutes.  Trim away some of the useless fat at the end and I'd be a happier person and probably even raise the rating to a 4 out of 5.  Oh and the ""bouquet of balls"" joke said by the wife when the family was revealing personal information about each other as a way of getting revenge was a REALLY awesome line.",3,"well, it has its moments",1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,2298,"['Change-Up', 'example', 'where', 'length', 'movie', 'was', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Two', 'hours', 'surely', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'less', '80', 'see', 'when', 'humor', 'was', 'was', 'REALLY', 'was', 'laughing', 'extremely', 'hard', 'such', 'babysititng', 'segment', 'way', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'character', 'was', 'holding', 'kids', 'running', 'down', 'stairs', 'then', 'setting', 'counter', 'only', 'discover', 'babies', 'were', 'ready', 'stick', 'heads', 'nearby', 'outlet', 'throw', 'knives', 'Ryan', 'head', 'THESE', 'were', 'great', 'moments', 'fact', 'segment', 'focused', 'babies', 'was', 'really', 'memorable', 'was', 'sort', 'weirded', 'out', 'one', 'baby', 'would', 'frequently', 'smack', 'head', 'side', 'crib', 'film', 'would', 'sort', 'speed', 'up', 'lol.The', 'problem', 'humor', 'frequently', 'sacrificed', 'romance', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'rather', 'case', 'Ryan', 'character', 'totally', 'tacked', 'when', 'example', 'Ryan', 'character', 'eventually', 'love', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'character', 'just', 'seemed', 'TOTALLY', 'pointless', 'truly', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'entire', 'segment', 'was', 'even', 'necessary', 'be', 'included.The', 'storyline', 'always', 'funny', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'best', 'actor', 'FAR', 'movie', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'urinate', 'make', 'wish', 'water', 'fountain', 'when', 'morning', 'discover', ""'ve"", 'been', 'switched', 'so', 'Ryan', 'immature/silly', 'personality', 'Jason', 'body', 'Jason', 'professional/serious', 'character', 'inside', 'Ryan', 'consequences', 'are', 'often', 'unusual', 'work', 'such', 'segment', 'when', 'Jason', 'Ryan', 'were', 'sitting', 'living', 'room', 'trying', 'convince', 'Jason', 'wife', ""'ve"", 'exchanged', 'bodies', 'wife', 'laughing', 'off', 'stupid', 'joke', 'really', 'annoying', 'aspect', 'way', 'characters', 'would', 'just', 'blurt', 'out', 'REALLY', 'obnoxious', 'swear', 'words', 'was', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'constitute', 'quality', 'writing', 'Lots', 'nudity', 'too.Again', 'movie', 'overlong', 'least', '30', 'minutes', 'Trim', 'away', 'useless', 'fat', 'end', ""'d"", 'be', 'happier', 'person', 'probably', 'even', 'raise', 'rating', '4', '5', 'Oh', 'bouquet', 'balls', 'joke', 'said', 'wife', 'when', 'family', 'was', 'revealing', 'personal', 'information', 'other', 'way', 'getting', 'revenge', 'was', 'REALLY', 'awesome', 'line']",N/A

Sawin,"[5, 11]","You've seen this movie on countless occasions; Freaky Friday, Face/Off, Freaky Friday again, The Skeleton Key, and Freaky Friday a third time amongst a half a dozen other movies I'm probably overlooking. Body swapping isn't exactly a new concept. Truth be told though, while the idea has been used in an R-rated film before it may be something new to the R-rated comedy genre. Maybe that's why we're taking this rather redundant feeling trip once again or maybe it's only to capitalize on Ryan Reynolds blossoming popularity and have long time fans of his reminisce about their first time watching Van Wilder. The Change-Up is coming whether you like it or not and while it isn't the funniest film of the year or even the most original, it isn't quite as bad as you might be expecting.Dave Lockwood (Jason Bateman) has been working hard his whole life. He thrived to make work the most important thing in his life and that shows as he's one of the best lawyers in town. Meanwhile Mitch Planko (Ryan Reynolds) has barely worked a day in his life and tends to quit anything when it shows the first signs of difficulty. Dave never seems to have time for anything while Mitch just wants someone to come home to and feel appreciated. So after a night at the bar and a conversation while urinating in a public fountain the two accidentally switch bodies.Raunchiness rears its ugly head not even five minutes into the movie. The Change-Up is probably the most obscene and easily the most vulgar movie of the year, at least thus far. The things that come out of Mitch Planko's mouth, whether he's in the body of Ryan Reynolds or Jason Bateman, walks a thin line between being profane and being downright offensive. It's so unbelievable that you can't help but laugh at times. The really bizarre thing is that I couldn't help but somewhat relate to the Mitch character. Not so much the sleeping around with countless women part, but his sense of humor, use of vulgarity, and dislike for children. That's basically me in a nutshell.Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds do a pretty flawless job of swapping each other's roles. The roles they both start off with are pretty much the roles we've always seen the two actors play, so seeing them switch it up a bit was kind of interesting. Jason Bateman will always bring a little bit of Michael Bluth with him wherever he goes while Reynolds will probably always be seen as Van Wilder first. That's part of their charm and part of the appeal for the fans that have been following them longer than a year or two. Bateman playing the douchebag is actually a lot of fun though and Reynolds is kind of charming in the nice guy role in an awkward and goofy kind of way. Their chemistry is really the thing that makes the comedy work as well as it does. Leslie Mann also has her moments, which usually come once her husband starts acting like his best friend. This is probably Olivia Wilde's best movie performance in the past few years though. She was so boring in both TRON: Legacy and Cowboys & Aliens. At least in this she gets to show that she's both professional and has a kinkier side while portraying much more emotion than in those two films.The movie progressively snowballs further and further into ridiculous territory as it drudges on though. The scene in the kitchen where Mitch is trying to figure out how to feed Dave's children just about ruined the entire thing for me and the whole Tatiana thing is really stretching it. Each character gets to coach the other while in the other's respective body and those scenes might have honestly been the best in the movie. They were concise and had all the strongest points of the movie in those segments. It's a shame the entire movie couldn't quite hold onto that throughout its duration. With all the fecal matter going into people's mouths, ball cupping, genital shaving, and women being shown on the toilet at inopportune moments, the toilet humor got to be a bit much at times and that's coming from a guy who's a fan of that type of humor.The Change-Up is slightly above the mediocre line for R-rated comedies this year. It's slightly similar to Hall Pass with a little bit of Bridesmaids and Your Highness thrown in for good measure. While it is fairly humorous at times, its outrageousness is its own downfall as certain bits are too ridiculous for its own good. However, The Change-Up was still a crowd pleaser and is sure to at least make a modest profit at the box office.",3,Recycled plot device with a solid cast,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,4467,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'countless', 'occasions', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'Face/Off', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'again', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'third', 'time', 'amongst', 'half', 'dozen', 'other', 'movies', ""'m"", 'probably', 'overlooking', 'Body', 'swapping', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'new', 'concept', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'idea', 'been', 'used', 'R-rated', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'new', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'genre', 'why', ""'re"", 'taking', 'rather', 'redundant', 'feeling', 'trip', 'once', 'again', 'maybe', 'only', 'capitalize', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'blossoming', 'popularity', 'have', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'reminisce', 'first', 'time', 'watching', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'Change-Up', 'coming', 'not', ""n't"", 'funniest', 'film', 'year', 'even', 'most', 'original', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'might', 'be', 'expecting.Dave', 'Lockwood', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'been', 'working', 'hard', 'whole', 'life', 'thrived', 'make', 'work', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'one', 'best', 'lawyers', 'town', 'Meanwhile', 'Mitch', 'Planko', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'barely', 'worked', 'day', 'life', 'quit', 'anything', 'when', 'first', 'signs', 'difficulty', 'Dave', 'never', 'have', 'time', 'anything', 'Mitch', 'just', 'someone', 'come', 'home', 'feel', 'appreciated', 'So', 'night', 'bar', 'conversation', 'urinating', 'public', 'fountain', 'two', 'accidentally', 'switch', 'bodies.Raunchiness', 'ugly', 'head', 'not', 'even', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Change-Up', 'probably', 'most', 'obscene', 'easily', 'most', 'vulgar', 'movie', 'year', 'least', 'thus', 'far', 'things', 'come', 'Mitch', 'Planko', 'mouth', 'body', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'thin', 'line', 'being', 'profane', 'being', 'downright', 'offensive', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'times', 'really', 'bizarre', 'thing', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'somewhat', 'relate', 'Mitch', 'character', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'sleeping', 'around', 'countless', 'women', 'part', 'sense', 'humor', 'use', 'vulgarity', 'dislike', 'children', 'basically', 'nutshell.Jason', 'Bateman', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'do', 'pretty', 'flawless', 'job', 'swapping', 'other', 'roles', 'roles', 'start', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'always', 'seen', 'two', 'actors', 'play', 'so', 'seeing', 'switch', 'up', 'bit', 'was', 'kind', 'interesting', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'will', 'always', 'bring', 'little', 'bit', 'Michael', 'Bluth', 'wherever', 'Reynolds', 'will', 'probably', 'always', 'be', 'seen', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'first', 'part', 'charm', 'part', 'appeal', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'longer', 'year', 'two', 'Bateman', 'playing', 'douchebag', 'actually', 'lot', 'fun', 'Reynolds', 'kind', 'charming', 'nice', 'guy', 'role', 'awkward', 'goofy', 'kind', 'way', 'chemistry', 'really', 'thing', 'comedy', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'also', 'moments', 'usually', 'come', 'once', 'husband', 'acting', 'best', 'friend', 'probably', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'best', 'movie', 'performance', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'least', 'show', 'professional', 'kinkier', 'side', 'portraying', 'much', 'more', 'emotion', 'two', 'films.The', 'movie', 'progressively', 'further', 'further', 'ridiculous', 'territory', 'scene', 'kitchen', 'where', 'Mitch', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'feed', 'Dave', 'children', 'just', 'about', 'ruined', 'entire', 'thing', 'whole', 'Tatiana', 'thing', 'really', 'stretching', 'character', 'coach', 'other', 'while', 'other', 'respective', 'body', 'scenes', 'might', 'have', 'honestly', 'been', 'best', 'movie', 'were', 'concise', 'had', 'strongest', 'points', 'movie', 'segments', 'shame', 'entire', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hold', 'duration', 'fecal', 'matter', 'going', 'people', 'mouths', 'ball', 'cupping', 'genital', 'shaving', 'women', 'being', 'shown', 'toilet', 'inopportune', 'moments', 'toilet', 'humor', 'got', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'times', 'coming', 'guy', 'who', 'fan', 'type', 'humor.The', 'Change-Up', 'slightly', 'mediocre', 'line', 'R-rated', 'comedies', 'year', 'slightly', 'similar', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'little', 'bit', 'Bridesmaids', 'Your', 'Highness', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'fairly', 'humorous', 'times', 'outrageousness', 'own', 'downfall', 'certain', 'bits', 'are', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'own', 'good', 'However', 'Change-Up', 'was', 'still', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'sure', 'least', 'make', 'modest', 'profit', 'box', 'office']",N/A

The raunchiness here was just over the top though.I think that might be a reason why this movie didn't make much money. It actually was a financial loss, according to Wiki.  According to IMDB, it is only a 6.5/10.  It had some funny moments, but most of the punchline was captured in the trailer.  There was a lot of cursing and swearing.  There were a lot of vulgar jokes.It was like they took the Disney movie, where people switch places, but fraternized it. There was a LOT of nudity. It was just randomly placed. Some scenes which were meant to be funny-- struck me as more grotesque.  It looks like the producers were going for shock factor.

Sure, it's been done several times before, but it's sort of become its own thing now. And ""The Change-Up"" does enough to bring its own brand to the sub-genre to make it stand out- namely embracing the notion of hard-R comedy that is aimed squarely at adults (under no circumstances watch this movie with your children, or you WILL be embarrassed!).Granted, you can't just throw a bunch of curse words into the script and expect it to be funny.

The concept of the story (two disparate characters changing lives in a manner as magical as the fairy tale 'The Three Wishes') is not new and at times it becomes wearing, but the big difference here is that the characters are assigned to two really brilliant comic actors - and so it works in the long run.Two longtime friends are feeling distance in their relationship: Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) is a womanizing free-spirited life as an actor for commercials and 'lorn movies' (soft porn) who lives in a pigsty of an apartment, grabbing fast food where he can find it, while Dave (Jason Bateman) is a conscientious successful lawyer with a major la firm in Atlanta, and is married to a beautiful woman, and lives in a picture book house with three small children.  The old concept of the grass being greener on the other side of the fence brings the men together for a drunken evening where while voiding in a  public fountain voice that they wish they could change places. Thunder, darkness and boo, they wake up as the other guy.  Mitch must carry on the functions of a learned lawyer while maintaining his own style and faces the duties of a parent of infants and a dissatisfied wife (Leslie Mann) while Dave attempts to adjust to the grungy Lothario existence as the lorn star, being pursued by the beautiful Sabrina (Olivia Wilde).  Gradually each man in his new role discovers ore about life by walking in the others shoes and it is at this point that the film becomes an intelligent vantage of appreciating what we have by seeing it through the eyes of polar opposite friends.Both Reynolds and Bateman have great comic timing and make us understand the conflicts of views and appreciation found in the change of lives.  The women in the cast do well and there is a touching cameo by Alan Arkin as Mitch's father.  This is a bawdy comedy with the emergence of a heart full of lessons in the end.  Make it through the fist 30 minutes and you'll find a good movie.

1408957,AEL6AD2AL2UX8,B004HO6I2E,"Kevin ""Revolution""","[6, 8]","This is a movie that's been done before in films like ""Big"" and ""The Parent Trap"".  However, I don't know if its been done between two grown men so maybe that might be where this is different.  The film is entertaining mainly because of the performances by Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds.  The female supporting cast is top notch as well, Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde who is beyond stunning and no surprise she's going to be in a movie called ""Welcome to People"" playing Michelle Pfeiffer's daughter.The male leads were fun to watch as they take over the other's persona.  Ryan Reynolds is a pot smoking slacker who stays home all day having sex and has zero goals.  Jason Bateman plays an unhappy married guy with a young kid and 2 babies.  His life is his miserable lawyer job and his way of finding happiness is buying more cars and houses.  Naturally both guys envy the other one's life.  Jason's character dreaming of spending the day doing nothing like his pal.  And Ryan's character envying that Jason's character has a family who looks forward to seeing him when he gets home to a place crammed with nice things.Both of them get that opportunity to switch into the other's body one drunk night as they're urinating in a park fountain.  Ordinarily they'd be slapped with a sexual predator ticket for doing that and done again in a mall in front of kids which was very strange that it was written that way, but obviously the movie pays no mind to those real life rules.The movie is also crude, crass and plagued with never ending foul language.  Maybe that'll be fun for a teenage boy, but for me it was wearing thin because it simply was not working each time.  There were places where it was warranted and it was funny, but then its sprinkled throughout so you're thinking, 'o-kayyy, what does that have to do with anyone?'  I've been known to curse like a sailor and sometimes no other word will do, but when it's forced in every line then it just comes off forced.  Jason Bateman was top notch in this and really belted out a great performance.",3,"Crude, Crass and bathed in humor and enough foul language to keep the censor board in business for a year",1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,2055,"['movie', 'been', 'done', 'films', 'Big', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'been', 'done', 'two', 'grown', 'men', 'so', 'maybe', 'might', 'be', 'where', 'different', 'film', 'entertaining', 'mainly', 'performances', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'female', 'supporting', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'as', 'well', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'who', 'stunning', 'surprise', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'called', 'Welcome', 'People', 'playing', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'daughter.The', 'male', 'leads', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'take', 'other', 'persona', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'pot', 'smoking', 'slacker', 'who', 'home', 'day', 'having', 'sex', 'zero', 'goals', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'unhappy', 'married', 'guy', 'young', 'kid', '2', 'babies', 'life', 'miserable', 'lawyer', 'job', 'way', 'finding', 'happiness', 'buying', 'more', 'cars', 'houses', 'Naturally', 'guys', 'envy', 'other', 'one', 'life', 'Jason', 'character', 'dreaming', 'spending', 'day', 'doing', 'nothing', 'pal', 'Ryan', 'character', 'envying', 'Jason', 'character', 'family', 'who', 'forward', 'seeing', 'when', 'home', 'place', 'crammed', 'nice', 'things.Both', 'get', 'opportunity', 'switch', 'other', 'body', 'one', 'drunk', 'night', ""'re"", 'urinating', 'park', 'fountain', 'Ordinarily', ""'d"", 'be', 'slapped', 'sexual', 'predator', 'ticket', 'doing', 'done', 'again', 'mall', 'front', 'kids', 'was', 'very', 'strange', 'was', 'written', 'way', 'obviously', 'movie', 'mind', 'real', 'life', 'rules.The', 'movie', 'also', 'crude', 'crass', 'plagued', 'never', 'ending', 'foul', 'language', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fun', 'teenage', 'boy', 'was', 'wearing', 'thin', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'working', 'time', 'were', 'places', 'where', 'was', 'warranted', 'was', 'funny', 'then', 'sprinkled', 'so', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'o-kayyy', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'anyone', ""'ve"", 'been', 'known', 'curse', 'sailor', 'sometimes', 'other', 'word', 'will', 'do', 'when', 'forced', 'line', 'then', 'just', 'off', 'forced', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'really', 'belted', 'out', 'great', 'performance']",N/A
1408958,AJ66SZG3DGVH1,B004HO6I2E,K.H.,"[0, 3]","In my opinion, comedy is the most difficult thing to capture.  A drama or action movie?  That's easy.  Comedy has to walk a fine line.  It has to be close enough to reality so that people can relate to it, but not so close that it becomes uncomfortable.  This movie crossed that line a few times.  It's about two guys who trade bodies and lives.  As usual with that type of movie (and it's a little pathetic that there are at least a handful of movies that all have that plot), each person grows to understand and appreciate the other's life.  The problem is that this movie is an adult movie and therefore deals with adult issues.  And that often causes that uncomfortable feeling where you have this fake grin stuck on your face while you're thinking ""uh, am I supposed to laugh here?""I mean, it's *sort* of funny when you throw a bachelor into a family and he has to figure out how to deal with a little girl and two babies.  It's not so funny when you introduce the concept of him having sex with his friend's wife in that guy's body.  That's uncomfortable, not ""laugh out loud funny.""  It's sort of funny when they show the realities of marriage -- the ""hot"" wife who eats Thai food and is unloading on the toilet.  Not so funny when they show her constantly whining and complaining that ""work comes first and I always come second"" to everyone in multiple scenes.  And not so funny when you realize that the guy is working like crazy to make a good life for his family, who live in a giant house and are well-off.  Sure, you could argue that it's a lesson that you don't need a lot to be happy ...but that's not really the place of a comedy, right?  You see where I'm going?Then there are the other random lazy plot contrivances.  Like the fact that a slacker actor suddenly can master the nuances of a legal merger as a lawyer within a few weeks because he ""tried really hard.""  I guess all you have to do is concentrate or something.  Or how a woman who gets set up with the slacker actor falls for him just because he eats a lot of pastries in slow motion (that's not a joke, by the way; that was the entire date).So what's the ""OK"" part of it?  Well, if you ignore all that other stuff, there are bits and pieces that are funny, so I'd give it an average grade.  The problem was that you have to wait for those parts to show up, which isn't the mark of a good comedy to me.  In between, it seemed like this movie was more trying to be a quasi-afterschool special with a heartfelt message about life.  Which it sort of failed at.

Yes, there were a few moments where I simply laughed out loud, but others where I kind of shook my head. Childhood friends Mitch (Reynolds) and Dave (Bateman) have secretly envied each others' lives. Mitch is a free minded actor who goes thru his life with no responsibilities or consequences for his actions. Dave is a successful attorney with a wife and kids, who thinks the grass is greener on the other side, which in this case would be the life of his free spirited friend. Wishing for the others' life, Mitch and Dave chant their desires while urinating in a fountain in the park. Waking to find themselves in the others' body, they each set to have what they always desired. Through a series of misadventures.....and there are several...they learn to appreciate what they have. Dave learns that success and wealth won't bring you happiness if you don't take the time to appreciate those who love and care for you; while Mitch learns that ignoring his responsibilities; being promiscuous; and smoking pot gets a little old as you get older.Overall, the movie was ok and somewhat entertaining, and in the end, the theme was clear....""the grass is not always greener"" or ""appreciate, cherish and be grateful for what you have"".  And finally, while I thought I selected the theatrical version, there were some scenes that contained nudity and or sexual innuendo. The ""F"" word was also used liberally.

Here, Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman play best friends who simultaneously pee into a fountain somewhere in Atlanta, Georgia, while wishing to have each other's lives.  Without any legit explanation to be seen anywhere in the film, their wish comes true.  Reynolds, formerly a slacker and porn actor/womanizer, now has to take on the responsibilities of Bateman, who's a successful attorney, married, and the father of three young children.  Bateman in turn sees that Reynolds might not be quite all roses...Reynolds never mentioned the porn.  Despite this plot having happened in one way or another in many movies before this one, this was still a film with its fair share of jokes.  Unfortunately, this is one of those films where I can't make up my mind as to whether or not I like Leslie Mann.  Olivia Wilde, on the other hand, has my uncontested support.  She was quite fun to watch and I liked her character's more wild side...though isn't being pushed into a date by your boss with your boss's friend grounds for sexual harassment.

The big 'switch' occurs after a night of 'bromancing', where the two friends both find themselves urinating in front of a statue fountain, whose visage reminds one vaguely of the Statue of Liberty. The Statue appears to have some magical powers, which causes the transformation.Jason Bateman plays the 'straight' friend, Dave Lockwood, a workaholic attorney who is married with three kids in the suburbs. Ryan Reynolds plays Mitch Planko, his offbeat, somewhat vulgar friend, who provides the comic relief.Clearly the far more entertaining character is Mitch, who is continually pushing boundaries from the outset. So when Mitch becomes Dave, Dave has the much better part. We get to see how Mitch as Dave, upsets Dave's world. The humor comes from the fish out of water premise: Mitch simply doesn't fit into Dave's world--but somehow, in the end, he manages to improve it.For example, he eventually convinces the CEO of Dave's company to play hardball with a rival Japanese company, during a mediation, and Dave's company ends up making out like bandits. On the personal level, Mitch as David hilariously convinces Dave's daughter to meet 'violence with violence', so she retaliates after a school bully knocks her down during a ballet performance.Unfortunately when David pretends to be Mitch, there is no comic equivalence. The whole idea is that David needs to slow down and adopt Mitch's spontaneous lifestyle. There's nothing funny when he's forced to be aloof during Mitch's porno shoot, or the trip to the Aquarium or relaxing, watching a DVD of 'Animal House'. And there are also no laughs when he starts dating Sabrina, Dave's sexy colleague at work, where he finally learns to become more spontaneous.Mitch as Dave also falls into line, becoming more responsible as a good parent and eventually reconciling with his father, by attending his father's wedding. So by the end of the film, the best friends learn their valuable life lessons, but whatever humor was generated earlier, with the real Mitch doing his shtick and then Mitch as David doing his thing, is lost. Dave or Dave as Mitch, was never funny in the first place (regardless of the absurd 'poop attack' by Dave's infant, at the beginning of the film).A good part of 'The Change-Up' also relies on bathroom humor which has limited appeal. One particular scene that fails to fire is the big buildup for Dave's wife when she enters the bedroom, only to end up in the bathroom on the toilet, concentrating on a series of difficult bowel movements.In the end, this is a film that is mildly amusing in spots. Somehow if Dave also had some more significant idiosyncrasies like Mitch, this would have been a funnier film.",2,Only one half of this body swap 'bromance' tickles the funny bone,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,2864,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'The"", 'Change-Up', 'occasionally', 'amusing', 'farce', 'involving', 'two', 'life-long', 'friends', 'who', 'sleight', 'hand', 'end', 'up', 'one', 'bodies', 'big', ""'switch"", 'occurs', 'night', ""'bromancing"", 'where', 'two', 'friends', 'find', 'urinating', 'front', 'statue', 'fountain', 'visage', 'one', 'vaguely', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'Statue', 'have', 'magical', 'powers', 'transformation.Jason', 'Bateman', ""'straight"", 'friend', 'Dave', 'Lockwood', 'workaholic', 'attorney', 'who', 'married', 'three', 'kids', 'suburbs', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'plays', 'Mitch', 'Planko', 'offbeat', 'somewhat', 'vulgar', 'friend', 'who', 'comic', 'relief.Clearly', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'character', 'Mitch', 'who', 'continually', 'pushing', 'boundaries', 'outset', 'So', 'when', 'Mitch', 'Dave', 'Dave', 'much', 'better', 'part', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Mitch', 'Dave', 'Dave', 'world', 'humor', 'fish', 'water', 'premise', 'Mitch', 'simply', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Dave', 'world', 'somehow', 'end', 'improve', 'it.For', 'example', 'eventually', 'CEO', 'Dave', 'company', 'play', 'hardball', 'rival', 'Japanese', 'company', 'mediation', 'Dave', 'company', 'up', 'making', 'out', 'bandits', 'personal', 'level', 'Mitch', 'David', 'hilariously', 'Dave', 'daughter', 'meet', ""'violence"", 'violence', 'school', 'bully', 'down', 'ballet', 'performance.Unfortunately', 'when', 'David', 'be', 'Mitch', 'comic', 'equivalence', 'whole', 'idea', 'David', 'slow', 'down', 'adopt', 'Mitch', 'spontaneous', 'lifestyle', 'nothing', 'funny', 'when', 'forced', 'be', 'aloof', 'Mitch', 'porno', 'shoot', 'trip', 'Aquarium', 'relaxing', 'watching', 'DVD', ""'Animal"", 'House', 'are', 'also', 'laughs', 'when', 'dating', 'Sabrina', 'Dave', 'sexy', 'colleague', 'work', 'where', 'finally', 'become', 'more', 'spontaneous.Mitch', 'Dave', 'also', 'line', 'becoming', 'more', 'responsible', 'good', 'parent', 'eventually', 'reconciling', 'father', 'attending', 'father', 'wedding', 'So', 'end', 'film', 'best', 'friends', 'learn', 'valuable', 'life', 'lessons', 'humor', 'was', 'generated', 'earlier', 'real', 'Mitch', 'doing', 'shtick', 'then', 'Mitch', 'David', 'doing', 'thing', 'lost', 'Dave', 'Dave', 'Mitch', 'was', 'never', 'funny', 'first', 'place', 'regardless', 'absurd', 'attack', 'Dave', 'infant', 'beginning', 'film', '.A', 'good', 'part', ""'The"", 'Change-Up', 'also', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'limited', 'appeal', 'One', 'particular', 'scene', 'fire', 'big', 'buildup', 'Dave', 'wife', 'when', 'bedroom', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'bathroom', 'toilet', 'concentrating', 'series', 'difficult', 'bowel', 'movements.In', 'end', 'film', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'spots', 'Somehow', 'Dave', 'also', 'had', 'more', 'significant', 'idiosyncrasies', 'Mitch', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funnier', 'film']",N/A

Honestly, this tripe must have been written by relatives of someone within the Hollywood system (hey, I guess they have to do something to pay for their Mercedes). You can encase a turd in 24 carrot gold but it's still, at it's core, a turd.If you want a comedy with funny scenes with a script that makes sense you need to look somewhere else because this one has the consistency of thin, poor tasting gruel. It's like the writers (and even the director) took a look at ""Freaky Friday"" and tapped each scene for ""inspiration"" while drug or stoned. The director likewise must have been on some mind altering substance since the story has little to no continuity and strains credability (even for a fantasy comedy like this).To be fair, there are a couple of scenes that are very funny including a scene where Jason Bateman tries to feed the twins and one of then throws knives at him. I gave the film an extra star for this funny scene but the rest...well let's just say that I hope if the world ends tomorrow THIS isn't the only example of film comedy that survives. The bulk of the film though seems like it was written by a monkey at a typewriter and then the scenes were thrown into the air and randomly stapled together.If these things matter to you the Blu-ray looks positively stunning at times.Bateman and Reynolds are, as always, appealing even when they play repulsive characters. The cast, sadly, beyond the stars isn't really given a lot to do except look pretty, flash their breasts (in the case of the women)and smack their hand into their head as the main characters do something else stupid. The feel good tone of the ending is poorly handled and, well, seems tacked on from a totally different (better) movie even if it is cliched and overly sentimental.I've given this two stars because there are a couple of funny scenes but if a couple of funny scenes passes for quality filmmaking today, we've witnessed the nadir of American film comedy.",2,"Yep, they changed this up--replacing a funny comedy with this turd clearly written by a chimp at a typewriter.",1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,2058,"['Yep', 'did', 'change', 'up', 'replacing', 'potentially', 'funny', 'thoughtful', 'comedy', 'inept', 'idiocy', 'Honestly', 'tripe', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'relatives', 'someone', 'Hollywood', 'system', 'hey', 'guess', 'have', 'do', 'something', 'pay', 'Mercedes', 'can', 'encase', 'turd', '24', 'carrot', 'gold', 'still', 'core', 'turd.If', 'want', 'comedy', 'funny', 'scenes', 'script', 'sense', 'need', 'look', 'somewhere', 'else', 'one', 'consistency', 'thin', 'poor', 'tasting', 'gruel', 'writers', 'even', 'director', 'took', 'look', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'tapped', 'scene', 'inspiration', 'drug', 'stoned', 'director', 'likewise', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'mind', 'altering', 'substance', 'story', 'little', 'continuity', 'strains', 'credability', 'even', 'fantasy', 'comedy', '.To', 'be', 'fair', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'including', 'scene', 'where', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'feed', 'twins', 'one', 'then', 'knives', 'gave', 'film', 'extra', 'star', 'funny', 'scene', 'rest', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'hope', 'world', 'tomorrow', 'THIS', ""n't"", 'only', 'example', 'film', 'comedy', 'bulk', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'monkey', 'typewriter', 'then', 'scenes', 'were', 'thrown', 'air', 'randomly', 'stapled', 'together.If', 'things', 'matter', 'Blu-ray', 'positively', 'stunning', 'times.Bateman', 'Reynolds', 'are', 'always', 'appealing', 'even', 'when', 'play', 'repulsive', 'characters', 'cast', 'sadly', 'stars', ""n't"", 'really', 'given', 'lot', 'do', 'look', 'pretty', 'flash', 'breasts', 'case', 'women', 'smack', 'hand', 'head', 'main', 'characters', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'stupid', 'feel', 'good', 'tone', 'ending', 'poorly', 'handled', 'well', 'tacked', 'totally', 'different', 'better', 'movie', 'even', 'cliched', 'overly', 'sentimental.I', ""'ve"", 'given', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'couple', 'funny', 'scenes', 'couple', 'funny', 'scenes', 'passes', 'quality', 'filmmaking', 'today', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'nadir', 'American', 'film', 'comedy']",N/A

1409016,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B004HO6I2E,Z Hayes,"[4, 5]","A friend who loves comedies recommended this movie, so my husband and I watched it last night. Well, as far as storylines go, there's nothing new here. Justin Bateman plays Dave Lockwood, a successful, up and coming lawyer at a posh law firm. Dave is happily married to Jamie (Leslie Mann) and has a young daughter and infant twins. Then there's Dave's best friend, Mitch (Ryan Reynolds), who is a layabout and 'dabbles' in porn flicks.The story takes off after the drunk pair pee into a fountain one night, wishing that they could be the other person. Voila! Dave and Mitch end up switching bodies. This makes for some funny and yes, awkward moments, especially for Mitch who ends up living in Dave's house with Dave's family, sharing a bed and some uncomfortably intimate moments with Dave's wife. Dave in the meantime, finds out to his horror the degenerate lifestyle Mitch leads.The plot is predictable, and the saving grace is the hammy performances by both Bateman and Reynolds. There are some truly funny moments though, like when Dave (who is in Mitch's body) eagerly waits up for a romantic rendezvous with Mitch's regular Tuesday date (the boys have decided it is OK to have sex with the other's wife/ dates as they are technically in the other's body) and discovers the blond bombshell erm, has some hidden depths!I did feel there was too much profanity, unnecessary in my opinion. On the whole though , this is an average, light-hearted comedy made tolerable by Bateman's and Reynold's performances.",3,"Has its funny moments, but a bit over the top",1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,1511,"['friend', 'who', 'comedies', 'recommended', 'movie', 'husband', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'Well', 'as', 'far', 'storylines', 'go', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'Justin', 'Bateman', 'Dave', 'Lockwood', 'successful', 'up', 'coming', 'lawyer', 'posh', 'law', 'firm', 'Dave', 'happily', 'married', 'Jamie', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'young', 'daughter', 'infant', 'twins', 'Then', 'Dave', 'best', 'friend', 'Mitch', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'layabout', ""'dabbles"", 'porn', 'flicks.The', 'story', 'off', 'drunk', 'pair', 'pee', 'fountain', 'one', 'night', 'wishing', 'could', 'be', 'other', 'person', 'Voila', 'Dave', 'Mitch', 'end', 'up', 'switching', 'bodies', 'funny', 'yes', 'awkward', 'moments', 'especially', 'Mitch', 'who', 'up', 'living', 'Dave', 'house', 'Dave', 'family', 'sharing', 'bed', 'uncomfortably', 'intimate', 'moments', 'Dave', 'wife', 'Dave', 'meantime', 'out', 'horror', 'degenerate', 'lifestyle', 'Mitch', 'leads.The', 'plot', 'predictable', 'saving', 'grace', 'hammy', 'performances', 'Bateman', 'Reynolds', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments', 'when', 'Dave', 'who', 'Mitch', 'body', 'eagerly', 'up', 'romantic', 'rendezvous', 'Mitch', 'regular', 'Tuesday', 'date', 'boys', 'have', 'decided', 'OK', 'have', 'sex', 'other', 'wife/', 'dates', 'are', 'technically', 'other', 'body', 'blond', 'bombshell', 'erm', 'hidden', 'depths', 'did', 'feel', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'profanity', 'unnecessary', 'opinion', 'whole', 'though', 'average', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'made', 'tolerable', 'Bateman', 'Reynold', 'performances']",N/A
