1393368,A3HCZTTUH3CW9Z,B004AEQNS0,Amy Henley,"[19, 20]","I have all three Element yoga DVDs from Ashley Turner:Element: Yoga for Weight Loss,Element: Yoga for Stress Relief & Flexibility, and now Element Power Yoga.  Ms. Turner never fails to develop a sucessful yoga program.  What I like best is that although there are moves that I recognize from most yoga DVDs like the plank, warrior, and downward dog, she always throws in at least a few moves I've either never seen or are very rare for other yoga instructors.  Some exaples are reverse warrior and cresent with your arms wrapped around each other like a pretzle.  I especially like her focus on the abs in this DVD.  She uses planks, but also has other yoga abs moves so that you work the upper, lower, and obliques.  I also like her tone of voice, emphasis on breathing, and cuing.  The 60 minute DVD seemed to fly by, yet I felt I got a decent workout.  I think her Yoga for Weight Loss gives you a little more strenuous workout than Power Yoga, but I felt more in tune with my center after this one.  So I felt equally good afer both, but for different reasons.  I've practiced yoga long enough that the routine was ways to pick up on the first try, and I think others would have the same ease as well, no matter their level. I recommend this yoga DVD to everyone and look forward to Ms. Turner's next one.",5,Another hit from element and Ashley Turner,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,1310,"['have', 'three', 'Element', 'DVDs', 'Ashley', 'Turner', 'Element', 'Yoga', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Element', 'Yoga', 'Stress', 'Relief', 'Flexibility', 'now', 'Element', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Ms.', 'Turner', 'never', 'develop', 'sucessful', 'yoga', 'program', 'What', 'like', 'best', 'are', 'moves', 'recognize', 'most', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'plank', 'warrior', 'downward', 'dog', 'always', 'least', 'few', 'moves', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'are', 'very', 'rare', 'other', 'yoga', 'instructors', 'exaples', 'are', 'reverse', 'warrior', 'cresent', 'arms', 'wrapped', 'other', 'pretzle', 'especially', 'focus', 'abs', 'DVD', 'planks', 'also', 'other', 'yoga', 'abs', 'moves', 'so', 'work', 'upper', 'lower', 'obliques', 'also', 'tone', 'voice', 'emphasis', 'breathing', 'cuing', '60', 'minute', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'fly', 'yet', 'felt', 'got', 'decent', 'workout', 'think', 'Yoga', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'little', 'more', 'strenuous', 'workout', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'felt', 'more', 'tune', 'center', 'one', 'felt', 'equally', 'good', 'afer', 'different', 'reasons', ""'ve"", 'practiced', 'yoga', 'long', 'enough', 'routine', 'was', 'ways', 'pick', 'up', 'first', 'try', 'think', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'same', 'ease', 'as', 'well', 'matter', 'level', 'recommend', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'everyone', 'look', 'forward', 'Ms.', 'Turner', 'next', 'one']",Element: Power Yoga

1393371,A2VREJW7HAWVUQ,B004AEQNS0,"Elizabeth Haynes ""Writer""","[10, 13]","I really want to like her, and I've tried three of her DVDs.  But I just don't.  Her workouts feel really imbalanced to me.  There are no sun salutations to warm you up.  She uses the same muscle sets repeatedly, which I'm sure builds muscle but sure is boring and fatigues you very quickly.  Not to mention way too challenging for an average person.I have been a lifelong dancer, I still take studio classes and I do yoga, and my legs are extremely muscular.  But this is too hard for me.  I feel like you would need to be very advanced in your practice or an athlete to be able to complete this practice.I am used to a more vinyasa flow based power yoga.  There is a rhythm to it, and your whole body feels worked in balance.  Ashley's routines do not do this from what I have experienced.  She does not adequately warm you up, so you have a higher risk of injury (I actually injured myself doing one of her DVDs, and I have never injured myself with a yoga DVD and rarely injure myself in dance class).Her poses feel very commercial, even though she does focus on breathing.  And there is SO much chatter.  I appreciate her knowledge of psychology, but when I do yoga I am trying to quiet my mind and get in touch with my body and spirit, not listen to chatter about bettering myself.Another disappointing purchase for me.",2,Too chatty.
