The stories are heartfelt, moving, funny, with great scenery.It was clever how these episodes show how things got started- how Little Joe and Hoss got their nicknames, the story behind the fire on the map of the ponderosa and how the ponderosa got named.  I LOVE Beth Sullivan for her Dr Quinn series and I seeher great influence here- very moving and insightful, including issues for women- miscarriage, rape, and power. There are 2 powerful women in this show which is a change from the original.  The western theme is authentic- lots of action , horses, mountains and fights but there are important issues considered too such as the dignity of the Mexicans after the Mexican war and how often people are really alike even if from different backgrounds.  I loved this show. I wish there were more episodes!!!",5,Brilliant!

797154,A305I3B1NUSLUP,B00019PDP2,happylibrarian,"[1, 1]","The 2 part pilot gave some prequel explanations and then this series takes on stories of its own.  Although it was obviously not filmed at the ""ponderosa"" site and the Hop-Sing character given a much more significant role, the stories of character, integrity and relationship are certainly worthy of watching with your family.  There were actually 20 episodes done and this is only 10 of them.  It would be nice to have 11-20.  You have to turn loose of the well-ingrained visual characters to embrace Little Joe at age 12, while Hoss at 17 is a very likeable character and a good match to Dan Blocker, and this Adam not as distantly intellectual at age 21. and this Ben is very much a responsible, civic-minded, father-first character rather than the I-will-defend-my-land-to-the-death style that developed in the Bonanza series.  While all of the main characters in Bonanza were quick with a gun, The Ponderosa very much discourages their use.  So while there are some continuity differences, this was very enjoyable and a pleasure to watch for those of who miss the Westerns we grew up with.  Several of the episodes spoke of prejudices which led to interesting discussion at our house - that's always a win-win.  And, you get to know how they got their land in the first place!",5,Nice rest of the story and food for family discussion,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,1281,"['2', 'part', 'pilot', 'gave', 'prequel', 'explanations', 'then', 'series', 'stories', 'own', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'filmed', 'ponderosa', 'site', 'Hop-Sing', 'character', 'given', 'much', 'more', 'significant', 'role', 'stories', 'character', 'integrity', 'relationship', 'are', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'watching', 'family', 'were', 'actually', '20', 'episodes', 'done', 'only', '10', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', '11-20', 'have', 'turn', 'loose', 'well-ingrained', 'visual', 'characters', 'embrace', 'Little', 'Joe', 'age', '12', 'Hoss', '17', 'very', 'likeable', 'character', 'good', 'match', 'Dan', 'Blocker', 'Adam', 'not', 'distantly', 'intellectual', 'age', '21.', 'Ben', 'very', 'much', 'responsible', 'civic-minded', 'father-first', 'character', 'rather', 'I-will-defend-my-land-to-the-death', 'style', 'developed', 'Bonanza', 'series', 'main', 'characters', 'Bonanza', 'were', 'quick', 'gun', 'Ponderosa', 'very', 'much', 'use', 'So', 'are', 'continuity', 'differences', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'who', 'miss', 'Westerns', 'grew', 'up', 'Several', 'episodes', 'spoke', 'prejudices', 'led', 'interesting', 'discussion', 'house', 'always', 'win-win', 'get', 'know', 'how', 'got', 'land', 'first', 'place']",The Ponderosa: Season 1: Vol. 1 - Prequel to the TV Classic Bonanza

797156,A1QN075G0OKBWJ,B00019PDP2,Joe Bouler,"[4, 4]","Although they are calling this the Prequel to Bonanza, it aired from Sept 9, 2001 to May 12, 2002, long after Bonanza had ended. There never was a second season. This set contains the first 10 episodes. To the best of my knowledge, Volume two with the last 10 episodes does not exist. If it does, I can't find it anywhere.This series answers a lot of questions such as How did Ben Cartwright come to own the Ponderosa? How did The Ponderosa get it's name?What's the story behind the burning map that starts each episode of Bonanza? How did Hop Sing come to work for The Cartwrights? How did Eric Cartwright get the nickname Hoss?There are some conflicting stories between the Bonanza TV series and The Ponderosa TV series as to how Eric Cartwright got the nickname ""Hoss"".  On Bonanza, it was Eric's own mother who gave him the name. On The Ponderosa, it was Little Joe and his mother who tagged Eric with the name ""Hoss""I can't remember the particular episode of Bonanza where Ben was talking about Little Joe's mother and how she died, but I'm almost certain it was from some disease. In the Ponderosa TV series, she died from an explosion that was deliberately set.It's a little bit strange getting used to different actors playing the parts of the characters we know so well. Despite the different actors, every one of them plays their parts with excellence.Although there are some conflicting stories,I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to all my fellow Bonanza fans. I hope I can find the last 10 episodes.",5,Entertaining and Enjoyable,1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,1517,"['are', 'calling', 'Prequel', 'Bonanza', 'aired', 'Sept', '9', '2001', 'May', '12', '2002', 'long', 'Bonanza', 'had', 'ended', 'never', 'was', 'second', 'season', 'set', 'first', '10', 'episodes', 'best', 'knowledge', 'Volume', 'two', 'last', '10', 'episodes', 'not', 'exist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anywhere.This', 'series', 'lot', 'questions', 'such', 'How', 'did', 'Ben', 'Cartwright', 'come', 'own', 'Ponderosa', 'How', 'did', 'Ponderosa', 'get', 'name', 'What', 'story', 'burning', 'map', 'episode', 'Bonanza', 'How', 'did', 'Hop', 'Sing', 'come', 'work', 'Cartwrights', 'How', 'did', 'Eric', 'Cartwright', 'get', 'nickname', 'Hoss', 'are', 'conflicting', 'stories', 'Bonanza', 'TV', 'series', 'Ponderosa', 'TV', 'series', 'how', 'Eric', 'Cartwright', 'got', 'nickname', 'Hoss', 'Bonanza', 'was', 'Eric', 'own', 'mother', 'who', 'gave', 'name', 'Ponderosa', 'was', 'Little', 'Joe', 'mother', 'who', 'tagged', 'Eric', 'name', 'Hoss', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'particular', 'episode', 'Bonanza', 'where', 'Ben', 'was', 'talking', 'about', 'Little', 'Joe', 'mother', 'how', 'died', ""'m"", 'almost', 'certain', 'was', 'disease', 'Ponderosa', 'TV', 'series', 'died', 'explosion', 'was', 'deliberately', 'set.It', 'little', 'bit', 'strange', 'getting', 'used', 'different', 'actors', 'playing', 'parts', 'characters', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'different', 'actors', 'one', 'plays', 'parts', 'are', 'conflicting', 'stories', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'recommend', 'fellow', 'Bonanza', 'fans', 'hope', 'can', 'find', 'last', '10', 'episodes']",The Ponderosa: Season 1: Vol. 1 - Prequel to the TV Classic Bonanza
797157,A3875KWK1PXG7I,B00019PDP2,Robert Huggins,"[18, 18]","The setting is supposed to be Nevada, but ""The Ponderosa"" has Australia written all over it.  The series was filmed in Victoria, Australia and none other than Simon Wincer, the veteran Australian director of the original ""Lonesome Dove"" mini series and theatrical films like ""Quigley Down Under,"" is in the director's chair for the two-part pilot episode.  A few of the lead actors (Daniel Hugh Kelly and Brad Dourif, most notably) are Americans, but most of the supporting cast and guest cast are Australian, a few of whom are even recognizable to American audiences.  Mark Lee, who co-starred (with Mel Gibson) in Peter Weir's classic World War I film ""Gallipoli"" has a prominent role in one episode as does Lewis Fitz-Gerald, who appeared as one of the court-martialed soldiers in another Australian cinema classic, Bruce Beresford's ""Breaker Morant.""As to the episodes, there are some liberties taken with the original Bonanza storyline and some of the stories are a bit on the PC, preachy side, but the acting and production values are strong for this series.  In fact, I prefer the town and ranch settings in this series over the original ""Bonanza"" series, which used studio sets more than this prequel series does.  ""The Ponderosa"" also seems to be more mindful of authenticity, as you can see the actor's breaths when they speak in some episodes that were filmed on chilly days and the town's streets are often very muddy after a rainfall.The 10 episodes in this set are spread over 3 discs (3 episodes on discs 1 and 3; four episodes on disc 2).  The visuals are beautifully rendered on DVD and, in that respect, fans and newcomers (like me) to this series will not be disappointed.  However, it's a bit surprising for such a relatively recent series that no extras whatsoever are included on this set . . .  no interviews, episode commentaries, etc.  I would have been especially interested in seeing some biographies/filmographies for the cast, particularly those Australian cast members with whom I had no familiarity prior to seeing this series.Fans of TV Westerns have had relatively little in the way of new shows over the last few decades, so even if it comes from the Land Down Under, ""The Ponderosa"" is a welcome addition.
