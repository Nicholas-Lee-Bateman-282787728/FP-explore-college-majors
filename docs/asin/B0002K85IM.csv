Very good (though a little dated) story about kids at a military school, their reasons for being there as diverse as the kids themselves. When 'Hard Knox' is appointed to be the officer in charge, his tough but fair attitude, coupled with love and respect for traditions, the school, and the kids, changes them all immeasurably. Follow the kids as they go from desperately lonely and 'me-centered' to proud (the good kind) and caring and willing to function as a team. Great lessons and fun to watch.

838483,A21VC16VG0UQ91,B0002K85IM,Noah TW Givens,"[7, 8]","Where to begin?In the first place, some descriptions of ""Hard Knox"" on the 'net are in error. The DVD cover portrays Robert Conrad in an Airforce ROTC uniform with the Lockheed F-35 newest All purpose vertical landing fighter behind him.  F-35?  Air Force ROTC? Air Force?  None of this has the Slightest thing to do with the story inside!Regardless of the DVD Cover this story is about Ace MARINE Bird Colnel(sp?)  Fighter Pilot INSTRUCTOR (Call sign: 'Hard Knox') who is instantly medically grounded. A thirty year career of flying instantly grounded.Now what does he do?  He returns to the only home he has ever known, a military school...  The Military school is in shambles and will be closed due to lack of real control if 'somebody' doesn't do something.Hard Knox is put on the spot to run things for TWO WEEKS during his ACTIVE DUTY leave (the published description sez that he is retired).  Who joins him in this endeavor but his life/career long right-hand-man his maintenance chief....  (same main flight line crew chief as he had as 'Pappy Boyington' had in Baa Baa Black Sheep).So here we have two hardened MARINES to manage a failing Marine oriented military school. (Look for the 'commandant' and his dining room call to announcements - Oh Brother!)Unexpected plot twists and excellent work by the actors rescue an obviously c-budget story.  The Story is really well portrayed but the photography and ambience is a study in amaturish production.Worth a looksee if you like sucess stories.Quotes:Man, when does all this crying stop?Well, I cried for two weeks.  I had a room-mate that cried for two years.Major oops.  In the opening sequence they show F-4 Phantom aircraft from VMAF 312 (V-Fixed wing M-Marine F-Fighter A-Attack squadron number 312)  After landing they suddenly become VMFAT 101 (T-Training).Similar plot to The private war of Major Benson - Fireball Forward - and 12 O'clock High - to name a few.",3,New Commander Heals poorly performing Unit,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,1928,"['Where', 'begin', 'first', 'place', 'descriptions', 'Hard', 'Knox', ""'net"", 'are', 'error', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'Airforce', 'ROTC', 'uniform', 'Lockheed', 'F-35', 'newest', 'purpose', 'vertical', 'landing', 'fighter', 'F-35', 'Air', 'Force', 'ROTC', 'Air', 'Force', 'None', 'Slightest', 'thing', 'do', 'story', 'inside', 'Regardless', 'DVD', 'Cover', 'story', 'Ace', 'MARINE', 'Bird', 'Colnel', 'sp', 'Fighter', 'Pilot', 'INSTRUCTOR', 'Call', 'sign', 'Knox', 'who', 'instantly', 'medically', 'grounded', 'thirty', 'year', 'career', 'flying', 'instantly', 'grounded.Now', 'what', 'do', 'only', 'home', 'ever', 'known', 'military', 'school', 'Military', 'school', 'shambles', 'will', 'be', 'closed', 'due', 'lack', 'real', 'control', ""'somebody"", ""n't"", 'do', 'something.Hard', 'Knox', 'put', 'spot', 'run', 'things', 'TWO', 'WEEKS', 'ACTIVE', 'DUTY', 'leave', 'published', 'description', 'sez', 'retired', 'Who', 'endeavor', 'life/career', 'long', 'right-hand-man', 'maintenance', 'chief', 'same', 'main', 'flight', 'line', 'crew', 'chief', 'had', ""'Pappy"", 'Boyington', 'had', 'Baa', 'Baa', 'Black', 'Sheep', '.So', 'here', 'have', 'two', 'hardened', 'MARINES', 'manage', 'failing', 'Marine', 'oriented', 'military', 'school', 'Look', ""'commandant"", 'dining', 'room', 'call', 'announcements', 'Oh', 'Brother', 'Unexpected', 'plot', 'twists', 'excellent', 'work', 'actors', 'rescue', 'obviously', 'c-budget', 'story', 'Story', 'really', 'well', 'portrayed', 'photography', 'ambience', 'study', 'amaturish', 'production.Worth', 'looksee', 'like', 'sucess', 'stories.Quotes', 'Man', 'when', 'crying', 'stop', 'Well', 'cried', 'two', 'weeks', 'had', 'room-mate', 'cried', 'two', 'years.Major', 'oops', 'opening', 'sequence', 'show', 'F-4', 'Phantom', 'aircraft', 'VMAF', '312', 'V-Fixed', 'wing', 'M-Marine', 'F-Fighter', 'A-Attack', 'squadron', 'number', '312', 'landing', 'suddenly', 'become', 'VMFAT', '101', 'T-Training', '.Similar', 'plot', 'private', 'war', 'Major', 'Benson', 'Fireball', 'Forward', '12', ""O'clock"", 'High', 'name', 'few']",N/A
