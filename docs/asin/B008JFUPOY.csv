I think the movie is a little overhyped and don't believe it kept up with its predecessor. Also I've been trying to add to my 3D video library and got this in 3D which was okay but not what I'd consider top notch. Animation usually translates well in 3D but they didn't have enough of it.

1562410,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B008JFUPOY,Ace Reader,"[1, 3]","Disney~Pixar's ""Monster's University"" is a blast! I love this brilliant and beautiful animated film! I was hesitant to see it because the trailers looked a bit boring to me. Well, I'm here to tell you this film is not boring. It's excellent for young and old alike delivering a belly-laugh out-loud funny story throughout it's entirety. It's the perfect prequel to 2001 ""Monster's Inc."" telling us the story of how young monster's Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal), and James P. Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman), met for the first time, butted heads, then became fast friends. There is a wonderful new monster character voiced by actress Helen Mirren, I must mention that scared me in a good way. She plays Dean Hardscrabble at Monster's University where Mike and Sulley are going to learn how to scare little human children. And when you see her, she will scare and intimidate you too! Remember...in a good way!Director Dan Scanlon whose credits include Disney~Pixar ""Cars"" (2006) and short film ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" (2006), has done a wonderful job creating an entertaining fun family film that everyone will love. He's also the writer for this film along with Daniel Gerson and Robert L. Baird, who must have all had a blast writing this enchanting funny script. Lucky talented men!""Monster's University"" fits perfectly in front of it's wonderful predecessor ""Monster's Inc."", ending where it begins. After you see this film I recommend going home and watching ""Monster's Inc."" to see how well they fit together. Talented music man Randy Newman reprises his hit soundtrack from ""Monster's Inc."" to this new film. Go see this perfect summertime family film soon. You will love it and enjoy it just like I do!

Sure, the idea of revisiting all of these golden Pixar ideas and not necessarily giving us anything `new' seemed a tad boring, but `Monsters Inc.' was such a delightful film and the idea of sharing more time with Sully and Mike was something I looked forward to.  A prequel showing us how this dynamic duo started seemed promising, and from a purely entertainment standpoint, it was.  Sadly, the lack of originality truly surprised me and caused my adoration for the film itself to wane upon reflection.The first thing of note is that `Monsters University' is rather hilarious.  There is no avoiding this.  Even in its most obvious places, the film attacks your funny bone from almost every angle.  The dialog is sharp, the one-liners are effective and the physical comedy is spot on.  I was actually kind of shocked by this, considering that early word on the film was lackluster, and the idea of Dan Scanlon, the guy who wrote `Cars' (Pixar's weakest link by a LARGE margin), was the one who wrote and directed this caused a lot of concern.  But, where the laughs are consistent, the development of story is lazy and that can be attributed to Scanlon's lack of experience and skill.`Monsters University' plays out like a crossbreed of `The Hunger Games' and `The House Bunny'.  I know that sounds like a really odd mash up, and this film does not contain Playmates and teenage genocide, but conceptually it felt so generic in its laziness that pulling really any random `college' movie and or `competition' vehicle would be appropriate.  There just isn't enough individual personality to make this film work as a complete unit.The cast of characters are fun.  Individual scenes are hilarious (the sea urchin obstacle course scene had me in stitches) and some of the moments were really memorable (that final scare scene was something else), and while I was overjoyed to hear Helen Mirren's voice come out of Dean Hardscrabble's mouth (am I the only one who felt the classroom scenes felt very `Harry Potter') I just wish that this film were something better.  Crystal and Goodman are in top form and are really made for this kind of stuff, and the development of their friendship, while completely generic, feels genuine in the finale.  I just wish that the obviousness of the plot wasn't there.  The idea that a group of misfits who are looked down on by everyone, including the teachers, have to pull themselves together, work together, get over their differences and eventually rise above and earn respect is just so `been there done that' and yet, what else could they have done?Have we really exhausted all originality?At the end of the day, I give this a B+.

1562445,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B008JFUPOY,Anthony L.,"[3, 4]","Ever worried that Pixar has lost it's touch with sequels and films in general? Well you can stop worrying now. Monsters University is a delightfully entertaining film, filled with originality, humor, and Pixar's typical heart, that, while not ranking amongst Pixar's most ambitious films, is certainly among it's most delightful.From right out of the gate, with a Simpsons-worthy sight gag, Monsters University sets the fun, light, engaging tone that will keep both kids and adults entertained throughout.First off, the voicework is phenomenal. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are experts at this game by now, and their work is typically up to standard. Helen Mirren is shiversome-ly good as Dean Hardscrabble, and Nathan Fillion and Alfred Molina give great roles.Second, the film is filled with every sort of color and originality and humor in designing the monsters. MU is a bright and cheery film that is pleasant on the eyes, heavy on the laughs, and liberal with the heart. Just when you thought that the film was following a stereo-typical underdog story, Pixar changes up the ballgame. The ending of MU, especially, deserves loads of praise, for being simultaneously scary, hilarious, original, and actually quite moving.What more can I say? Monsters University is another hit from Pixar, sure to entertain both children and adults with colorful visuals, a fast-paced, funny story, and loads of humor and heart.

Sully on the other hand is a monster who comes from a family of ferocious beasts and seemingly doesn't even have to try to succeed in school. But the truth is his grades don't reflect his born ability to roar.Mike and Sully get into a fight before the first exam, break the dean's precious scream in a can and get kicked out of the program. But Mike finds a way to prove they can get back into the department...they must enter a contest with a team of other monsters to prove who is the scariest.This is a very colorful film, with subtle humor and enough chills to to keep viewers in suspense.My sisters enjoyed this. Me, not so much.I found the movie to be too tiresome...it went on and on and usually that's not the case with Pixar. I also found the jokes to be a bit off center...the part where the ""not scary"" monsters are in the basement and are having an initiation ritual with candles and a pledge to give their ""souls"" didn't seem right for a Pixar film...even with the added comic relief.Overall though, the message was inspiring.

After all, Monsters, Inc. was a huge hit....especially with my daughter!So...does Monsters University live up to the hype?  Well....yes it does!

After all, Boo was the ""cute factor"" in the first movie....and in this movie, of course, you don't have that.  BUT...aside from this ""lack of cute factor,"" Monsters University does not disappoint!In the movie, we learn the famous scare team's back story.  We begin the movie with Mike Wakowski (the ""walking eyeball"") as a young school child...and he is so adorable!  We find out about this overly enthusiastic character's past and how he developed his all consuming desire to become a ""scarer.""Then we cut to Mike Wakowski as a new college student at Monsters U.....we find out how earnestly he wants to achieve his goals...how devoted he is to book learning about scare tactics...enter James Sullivan (Sully)..who hails from a long line of scarers and who doesn't ""go by the book"" at all.  Sully is overly-confident that he will pass all the tests without ever cracking a book....hence the team of Mike and Sully is born!Of course, they don't exactly hit it off at first....There are many new characters to meet in this Pixar prequel.....a whole group of funny misfit monsters in a ""nerd"" fraternity....there are frat parties and college hijinks, and most of all, a big competition...all of this providing plenty of brightly hued action and humor for young children - with enough amusing dialogue and character development to keep parents entertained, as well.Even though we all know the outcome of the movie (this is a prequel, after all) the end result is never taken for granted as we watch...which is very clever of those writers, I think.

Pixar rarely disappoints and the bar is always set high. However, this movie managed to exceed my expectations. I expected a cute, heartwarming story with an uplifting ending, but Pixar never ceases to surprise. The story was funnier and more intelligent than I expected. The story was, of course, fun and exciting from the beginning. However, the story was unpredictable, refusing to fit into stereotypical molds by fooling you into believing the stereotype was occurring before overthrowing it with twists and turns. The story delivers constant laughs and a handful of unexpected twists that are as believable as they are unusual. Also, Pixar delivers an incredible cast of voices and beautiful animation. The visuals are stunning and the returning cast is great, with the new characters providing exceptional fun. The film is an overall joy to watch with great jokes and fun characters. The film is great fun for kids and a refreshing break from summer action blockbusters for adults. This is a great movie for all to enjoy between the rush of super-hero/ action films. I recommend this film for all ages.The Pixar short is fantastic, by the way. A story about an umbrella and many other inanimate objects that can move.

I was never a huge fan of the original; the original seemed really predictable which seems at odds with how uneven it was, too. The jokes were tame and Billy Crystal comes from that school of old comedians who always have a 'shtick' that I just find really annoying. And while the jokes in this prequel really aren't much better, I felt this film was a stronger movie overall.What I really liked was the writing and that the writers didn't turn this into another dumb kids story where all you have to do is *believe* and you can do and be anything at all.Kids, life ain't fair so suck it up, butterup!And this movie, though it seems at first like it's going to be a disingenuous, 'everyone's a special snowflake winner' takes a nice turn that is not only much more honest to real life but also plays into the continuation of the story. In fact the second half of this film is as good as anything Pixar has ever done and it's all because they stay true to the story and let the events play out without forcing it. Everything here is earned and it's solid storytelling.I also liked that Sulli was a jerk, it gave him a nice, albeit predictable, arc to dovetail nicely with Mike's more complicated arc of the self realization of his limitations. In fact, Mike's arc made me realize that setting this film at a university made much more sense than it did to me before I watched it.To be fair, the college setting here was still odd because what they show in the movie is so cliche, so stereotypical of Hollywood College that it lacked any genuine sense of place. And to add to sense of place - they designed an entire university for the film but I never really felt like I knew where the characters were on it at pretty much any time. They did a really bad job of using that campus as a character in the film - the OK frat house was used MUCH better.I liked was the scene with the adults in the camp ground. I really felt like Pixar was making a meta-statement on the nature of what frightened adults in cinema my trotting out all the old, tired shtick we see in so many horror films: furniture moving on its own, scrape marks, dolls ... it was all there. I thought the whole scene was subtly genius, in my opinion and it 'sold me' on the film as a whole.The movie isn't perfect and it's not my favorite Pixar film (how about an Incredibles sequel, eh?), but it was much better than I thought it would be and though uneven, it's a worthy entry in the Pixar library.",4,Everything is earned and it's solid storytelling,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,2532,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'liked', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'was', 'never', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'original', 'seemed', 'really', 'predictable', 'odds', 'how', 'uneven', 'was', 'too', 'jokes', 'were', 'tame', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'school', 'old', 'comedians', 'who', 'always', 'have', ""'shtick"", 'just', 'find', 'really', 'annoying', 'jokes', 'prequel', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'stronger', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'writing', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'dumb', 'kids', 'story', 'where', 'have', 'do', '*believe*', 'can', 'do', 'be', 'anything', 'all.Kids', 'life', 'ai', ""n't"", 'fair', 'so', 'suck', 'up', 'butterup', 'movie', 'first', 'going', 'be', 'disingenuous', 'special', 'snowflake', 'winner', 'nice', 'turn', 'not', 'only', 'much', 'more', 'honest', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'continuation', 'story', 'fact', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'Pixar', 'ever', 'done', 'stay', 'true', 'story', 'let', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'forcing', 'Everything', 'here', 'earned', 'solid', 'storytelling.I', 'also', 'liked', 'Sulli', 'was', 'jerk', 'gave', 'nice', 'predictable', 'arc', 'dovetail', 'nicely', 'Mike', 'more', 'complicated', 'arc', 'self', 'realization', 'limitations', 'fact', 'Mike', 'arc', 'made', 'realize', 'setting', 'film', 'university', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'did', 'watched', 'it.To', 'be', 'fair', 'college', 'setting', 'here', 'was', 'still', 'odd', 'what', 'show', 'movie', 'so', 'cliche', 'so', 'stereotypical', 'Hollywood', 'College', 'lacked', 'genuine', 'sense', 'place', 'add', 'sense', 'place', 'designed', 'entire', 'university', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'knew', 'where', 'characters', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'time', 'did', 'really', 'bad', 'job', 'using', 'campus', 'character', 'film', 'OK', 'frat', 'house', 'was', 'used', 'MUCH', 'better.I', 'liked', 'was', 'scene', 'adults', 'camp', 'ground', 'really', 'felt', 'Pixar', 'was', 'making', 'meta-statement', 'nature', 'what', 'frightened', 'adults', 'cinema', 'trotting', 'out', 'old', 'tired', 'shtick', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'furniture', 'moving', 'own', 'scrape', 'marks', 'dolls', 'was', 'there', 'thought', 'whole', 'scene', 'was', 'subtly', 'genius', 'opinion', ""'sold"", 'film', 'whole.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'not', 'favorite', 'Pixar', 'film', 'how', 'Incredibles', 'sequel', 'eh', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'uneven', 'worthy', 'entry', 'Pixar', 'library']",N/A

I have only one question after taking it in. How can a follow-up to such a highly regarded movie seem so stale when filmmakers had nearly 12 years to come up with a good storyline? What we get instead is an uninspired family-friendly rehash of &#34;Revenge of the Nerds&#34; and &#34;Revenge of the Nerds 2: Nerds in Paradise.&#34;Ever since childhood, Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) wanted only one thing in life. He wanted to attend Monsters University and become a great Scarer. His dreams are shattered when he meets James P. Sullivan, &#34;Sulley&#34; (John Goodman), and their competitive natures get them kicked out of the college's Scare Program. Now the two must find a way to work together and get themselves back into the running to fulfill their lifelong goals.&#34;Monsters University&#34; might falter in its story, but it excels with a fabulous audio and video presentation. The picture is clean and the color scheme of the film pops out at you. The Dolby TrueHD 7.1 surround sound puts the audience right in the middle of all the onscreen antics and noise you would expect to hear at a Scare School.There are plenty of special features for &#34;Monsters University.&#34; Audio commentary is provided by Director/Co-writer Dan Scanlon, Producer Kori Rae, and Story Supervisor Kelsey Mann. Eleven featurettes explore different aspects of the making of the film. Deleted scenes, art galleries, and promo picks are also included. Pixar's latest short, &#34;Blue Umbrella,&#34; is featured as well.Kids will love &#34;Monsters University&#34; and that's really all that matters. However, their parents might feel as if they're watching a watered-down children's version of &#34;Revenge of the Nerds&#34; or &#34;Animal House&#34; without all the dirty jokes.

From that point on the kid dreamed of the day he would be one, he also knew he wanted to go to Monster&#8217;s University for that education after meeting a monster that went there. So when the time came no one was more excited to make it at the school. But as Mike has to work hard to make it others like James Sullivan seem to have it made as they can get by on their natural abilities and charisma, and their names. But as the rivalry builds between the natural enemies one accident in class leads these two on a journey that forces them to come together.Naturally as a Pixar flick this film looks amazing and flows smoothly for the old eyeballs. It is a wonderful world to look at and follow full of great characters. Many from the first film appear here including my personal favorite Randell Bogs voiced by one of my favorite actors Steve Buscemi. It was great seeing how he became what he was in the first film and why he hated Sully so much. Of course Billy Crystal and John Goodman return as Mike and Sully and do a great job.It was cool to see how these guys became friends and how they met plus their pledge brothers are a fun bunch. Now I consider the first film to be a classic as I loved that film, this one is really good but it does not make it to the level of the first in my opinion. Still it is a very fun movie that I think anyone would enjoy. The story is great and the characters are just what you would expect from Pixar. Still the best thing about this release is the extras. There are various behind the scenes stuff that go into great detail about the film, and deleted scenes and such. But for me I really enjoyed the commentary track for this film, the expanded on cut scenes and how things came to be much like they did in the behind the scenes. Now while the movie alone would have gotten a lower score I have to give the Blu-Ray/DVD combo 5 stars for the whole package.",5,EXCELLENT COMBO PACK,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,2441,"['MONSTER', '8217', 'S', 'UNIVERSITYI', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'first', 'film', 'film', 'prequel', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'hooked', 'first', 'time', '8220', 'laid', 'eye', '8221', 'characters', 'story', 'were', 'excellent', 'so', 'when', 'first', 'learned', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'would', 'continue', 'story', 'then', 'was', 'announced', 'prequel', 'was', 'wonderful', 'would', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'guys', 'came', 'together.Mike', 'Wazowski', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'scarer', 'ever', 'visited', 'factory', 'where', 'action', 'point', 'kid', 'dreamed', 'day', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'also', 'knew', 'wanted', 'go', 'Monster', '8217', 'University', 'education', 'meeting', 'monster', 'went', 'there', 'So', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'excited', 'make', 'school', 'Mike', 'work', 'hard', 'make', 'others', 'James', 'Sullivan', 'seem', 'have', 'made', 'can', 'get', 'natural', 'abilities', 'charisma', 'names', 'rivalry', 'natural', 'enemies', 'one', 'accident', 'class', 'two', 'journey', 'come', 'together.Naturally', 'Pixar', 'flick', 'film', 'amazing', 'smoothly', 'old', 'eyeballs', 'wonderful', 'world', 'look', 'follow', 'full', 'great', 'characters', 'Many', 'first', 'film', 'appear', 'here', 'including', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Randell', 'Bogs', 'voiced', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'how', 'became', 'what', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'why', 'hated', 'Sully', 'so', 'much', 'course', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'John', 'Goodman', 'return', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'do', 'great', 'job.It', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'how', 'guys', 'became', 'friends', 'how', 'met', 'pledge', 'brothers', 'are', 'fun', 'bunch', 'Now', 'consider', 'first', 'film', 'be', 'classic', 'loved', 'film', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'not', 'make', 'level', 'first', 'opinion', 'Still', 'very', 'fun', 'movie', 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'enjoy', 'story', 'great', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'Pixar', 'Still', 'best', 'thing', 'release', 'extras', 'are', 'various', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'film', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'such', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'commentary', 'track', 'film', 'expanded', 'cut', 'scenes', 'how', 'things', 'came', 'be', 'much', 'did', 'scenes', 'Now', 'movie', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'lower', 'score', 'have', 'give', 'Blu-Ray/DVD', 'combo', '5', 'stars', 'whole', 'package']",N/A
1562546,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUPOY,FNDNreview,"[3, 4]","When it comes to animation, Disney's Pixar is second to none.  Pixar continues to one-up itself by producing impressive animation, while incorporating interesting stories for children...and adults.  Typically, animated features are catered towards children, yet certain films aren't necessarily as widely popular as others.  For instance, Toy Story continues to be adored by children, while also maintaining critical acclaim.  Oddly enough, Pixar's first creation (Toy Story) is still the benchmark for future productions - not just for Disney, but also for rival animators DreamWorks (Shrek) and Illumination Entertainment (Despicable Me).  The future of Pixar appears to be extremely bright as they focus on creating fresh new ideas while still revisiting popular characters from the worlds of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and the newly released Monsters Inc. prequel, Monsters University.Billy Crystal and John Goodman reprise their roles as Mike Wazowski and Sully Sullivan (respectively) in Monsters University, telling the story of their first meeting and the events leading to their friendship.  Mike believes he's destined to be a professional ""scarer,"" but no one finds him to be even remotely scary, despite his endless knowledge on the subject.  On the other hand, Sully comes from a well-known family of scarers, and believes he doesn't need to study to become a success.  After instantly becoming rivals, Mike and Sully are both kicked out of the scare program for their short-comings, and are forced to work together to earn their way back.  Mike makes a deal with the university headmistress, Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren), to allow them to reenter the program if their ""joke"" of a fraternity, Oozma Kappa (OK), wins the schools scare competition.  The OK fraternity must walk the tough path to victory as a team and prove their doubters wrong or face further embarrassment from their already harsh critics.After a boatload of hoop-jumping, another Monsters film has finally arrived.  But, was it worth the wait?  It's a bit of a complex question, but the short answer is yes.  It's not as though there have been a shortage of quirky animated films during the 12 absence of Mike and Sulley, but in case you haven't been able to tell by the long lines of people waiting to see Monsters University - the duo has clearly been missed by fans.  Did it take too long for a sequel (prequel) to arrive?  Of course, it did.  However, good things come to those who wait, and for the most part, your patience will have paid off when you're in your seat, preparing for the bright colors to attack your eyes.  And, rest assured - the disdainful feeling that has mounted over the years between films will evaporate, leaving you to enjoy a film that remains loyal and true to the wondrous characteristics of the first film.John Goodman and Billy Crystal pick-up as though they had never left off, quickly going from best friends in the first film to rivals in the prequel.  It was a bit of a shocking turn of events, but it makes for a much more ambitious plot as opposed to the simple idea that the pair would best friends from childhood.  These two characters come together in a very unlikely scenario, which is the major reason this film turns out to be as interesting as it is.  Surprisingly, there really isn't any hardnosed villain to battle in this film as there was in the first film (even though Steve Buscemi does return as the future evil-doer, Randall Boggs).  This film is more about Mike and Sulley being forced to work together for a common goal:  to win a competition in order to take one step closer to achieve their dream of becoming a scarer.Monsters University is a typical theme-driven film that puts the main characters in the usual situation of having to look outside themselves and rely on others for help.  Both of the main characters know what they want to achieve, but life serves up roadblocks for them and if they apply themselves, they can achieve their goals regardless of the unforeseen hurdles.  Speaking of hurdles, competition plays a major factor in the lives of these characters once again - as it did in the beginning of the first film with the scare competition.  Monsters University features the Scare Games for roughly half of the film, including events focusing on the importance of teamwork, rather than focusing on individual accolades.  However, the premise is the same as the majority of other group competition films, with the OK fraternity being outsiders and dysfunctional at first, then learning how to come together and function as a team.Overall, Monsters University is equally as enjoyable as its predecessor, combining bright colors with an enjoyable plot, not to mention plenty of laughs along the way.  The plot makes for an interesting dynamic, meshed with a successful narrative that bridges the gap from the beginning of the duo's college career to the beginning of Monsters Inc.  Although it's still a bit questionable that Disney chose to do a prequel rather than a sequel, it's still a film that anyone can enjoy - even if you didn't see the first film.  Mike and Sully are just as enjoyable as before, meaning their return to the big screen will easily appease the fans.  Monsters University has been slated to be a box office powerhouse from the moment it was announced and it will clearly content for the title of the highest grossing animated film of 2013.Grade:

Its a very good movie, but it just doesn't quite make it to the same level as the first movie.  That being said, its a great glimpse into the beginnings of the friendship of Mike and Sully that we see in Monsters Inc and another fun view into their Monster World.  While, we also get glimpses of other familiar monsters from the first movie, both those we love and those we love to hate.Of course, the movie takes place at Monsters University, where both Mike and Sully are enrolled in the Scarers Program.  Sully is following in the footsteps of his scary family, but feels he doesn't need to apply himself and actually study because he is just naturally scary.  Mike works harder than anyone, but no one takes him seriously as a scarer.  After all, he's pretty much just a green ball with one eye and can't pull off a scary roar to save his life.  They both get kicked out of the program, but find another way back in through attempting to win the Scare Games.  Problem is, they need to not only overcome their dislike for each other, but also help the other &#34;losers&#34; in their new frat also win the games (funny thing how the initials for their frat is &#34;OK&#34;).Along the way, we see how these so-called losers pull together and display abilities that even they didn't know they have.  We also see how Mike and Sully eventually became the best scarer team that the Monster World ever knew as each realizes their own talents and abilities and much you still need to apply yourself and work hard to realize your potential.Kids will like this movie.  Its very vibrant and filled with bright colors and action.  The animation is very well done--in fact, in one scene, I could have sworn they had gone to a live shot, the scene looked so very real.

1562558,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B008JFUPOY,Gerard D. Launay,"[1, 3]","The first thing I can say about this film is that I was smiling all the way through.  Although it is many years since I went to college, this one really hits the mark.  It works so well because it avoids many of the usual teenager cliches and actually attempts to view the experience as it is really ""felt"" by the characters.  Another ""plus"" for me is that the University itself is based upon the University of California at Berkeley.  Because here I went to law school and my offices are nearby, all brings back good memories.Despite the many interesting monster characters, three stand out.  Mike is the student who everyone picks on. His success depends on applying himself every day for school through hard work and study. Obviously, he does not have the look of a ""scarer"" and thus has to work harder (and smarter) than everyone else. (Students who are a little ""different"" from their fellows will definitely relate to him).  ""Sully"" is the jock in the class, a true monster with natural talent but he cares little for actual studying. It's likely he was admitted to university because his dad was a famous student. When Mike and Sully eventually become roommates, they seem a mismatched pair...who don't even like each other.  But they learn and grow and find ways to respect the other.  ""Dean Hardscrabble"" is the tough teacher who thinks neither of them have the ""right stuff"" to succeed and, boy, is she frightening in her own way. Helen Mirren injects real menace to her voice as a caterpillar/dragon figure. (Don't forget the librarian - who has some surprises of her own).  Every college student encounters at least one tough and mean professor - think Dr. Charles Kingsfield of the ""Paper Chase"".  The students at Monsters University must figure out how to survive under such an intimidating teacher. Mike Wazowsky plans on winning the annual scare contest to prove himself worthy. But...he has to assemble a team - including Sully - to win.  The problem is that most of the team members are weak...so each has to improve. Few cartoons make you care about the characters as people...this one truly succeeds in that department. Truly, Pixar's most impressive achievement with this feature is that the team developed true-to-life personalities for the ostensible monsters. That's why I prefer this prequel to the original.  Perhaps not as clever, but more down to earth.Another ""plus"" for the film is the attention to detail such as recreating the real look of a dorm room: The cheap desks, the posters on the wall, the bunkbeds, the claustrophobic feel of those rooms.  On the lawn, characters throw frisbees, the library is daunting, the celebration party in the fraternity illustrates the fun of the madness.  All the animators paid a lot of attention to their own experiences to make a college look right.Like many Pixar films - the humor is directed at the young, teenagers, and the mature - so there are connections for everyone.  Yes, this is a perfect family film and one of the best Pixar offerings in years.  I hope it finds a large audience. The ending is quite astonishing...with intriguing lessons for the viewers...but to reveal it might spoil the importance of seeing the film.",5,Consistently Entertaining Spoof on the College Experience,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,3203,"['first', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'smiling', 'way', 'many', 'years', 'went', 'college', 'one', 'really', 'mark', 'so', 'well', 'many', 'usual', 'teenager', 'cliches', 'actually', 'attempts', 'view', 'experience', 'really', 'felt', 'characters', 'University', 'based', 'University', 'California', 'Berkeley', 'here', 'went', 'law', 'school', 'offices', 'are', 'nearby', 'brings', 'back', 'good', 'memories.Despite', 'many', 'interesting', 'monster', 'characters', 'three', 'stand', 'Mike', 'student', 'who', 'everyone', 'success', 'applying', 'day', 'school', 'hard', 'work', 'study', 'Obviously', 'not', 'have', 'look', 'scarer', 'thus', 'work', 'harder', 'smarter', 'everyone', 'else', 'Students', 'who', 'are', 'little', 'different', 'fellows', 'will', 'definitely', 'relate', 'Sully', 'jock', 'class', 'true', 'monster', 'natural', 'talent', 'little', 'actual', 'studying', 'likely', 'was', 'admitted', 'university', 'dad', 'was', 'famous', 'student', 'When', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'eventually', 'become', 'roommates', 'seem', 'mismatched', 'pair', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'other', 'learn', 'grow', 'find', 'ways', 'respect', 'other', 'Dean', 'Hardscrabble', 'tough', 'teacher', 'who', 'have', 'right', 'stuff', 'succeed', 'boy', 'frightening', 'own', 'way', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'real', 'menace', 'voice', 'caterpillar/dragon', 'figure', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'librarian', 'who', 'surprises', 'own', 'college', 'student', 'encounters', 'least', 'one', 'tough', 'mean', 'professor', 'think', 'Dr.', 'Charles', 'Kingsfield', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'students', 'Monsters', 'University', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'survive', 'intimidating', 'teacher', 'Mike', 'Wazowsky', 'winning', 'annual', 'scare', 'contest', 'prove', 'worthy', 'assemble', 'team', 'including', 'Sully', 'win', 'problem', 'most', 'team', 'members', 'are', 'weak', 'so', 'improve', 'Few', 'cartoons', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'people', 'one', 'truly', 'department', 'Truly', 'Pixar', 'most', 'impressive', 'achievement', 'feature', 'team', 'developed', 'true-to-life', 'personalities', 'ostensible', 'monsters', 'why', 'prefer', 'prequel', 'original', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'clever', 'more', 'down', 'earth.Another', 'film', 'attention', 'detail', 'such', 'recreating', 'real', 'look', 'dorm', 'room', 'cheap', 'desks', 'posters', 'wall', 'bunkbeds', 'claustrophobic', 'feel', 'rooms', 'lawn', 'characters', 'throw', 'frisbees', 'library', 'daunting', 'celebration', 'party', 'fraternity', 'fun', 'madness', 'animators', 'paid', 'lot', 'attention', 'own', 'experiences', 'make', 'college', 'look', 'right.Like', 'many', 'Pixar', 'films', 'humor', 'directed', 'young', 'teenagers', 'mature', 'so', 'are', 'connections', 'everyone', 'Yes', 'perfect', 'family', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'Pixar', 'offerings', 'years', 'hope', 'large', 'audience', 'ending', 'quite', 'astonishing', 'intriguing', 'lessons', 'viewers', 'reveal', 'might', 'spoil', 'importance', 'seeing', 'film']",N/A

Let&#8217;s face it, without an adorable little girl like Boo, the emotional is at least different if not as intense.Mike is actually a more sympathetic character than Sully, who has had everything handed to him throughout life and learns that effort is necessary to really succeed. We also get a few origin stories, particularly focusing on creep-in-the-making Randall.Too many recent animated features seem to have a checklist approach to the supporting characters, rehashing &#8220;types&#8221; rather than coming up with something new. Not so here, with such new friends as middle-aged Don, the kind of guy you might meet in night school.The voice cast is, as always, impeccably cast with recognizable names chosen for what they bring to the characters and story, as well as the best Hollywood voice actors rounding out the ensemble.Randy Newman&#8217;s score is a little different from what one might typically expect. There&#8217;s quite a bit of the college pep rally sound &#8211; and a main theme that reminds me of John Williams&#8217; theme to Steven Spielberg&#8217;s 1941.Like the best Pixar Blu-ray packages, this one is loaded with superb extras, so much so that I have annotated the list. You can really get a feel for the creative process at the studio, minus the &#8220;look where we get to go&#8221; feeling that some other features seem to engender among those who will never trod in the same footsteps.

1562569,A2HD1FY51FM1TW,B008JFUPOY,Grimluke,"[0, 0]","After Cars 2 and Brave (which weren't BAD, but worse than average Pixar) I started to fear for the future of Pixar. Could they actually be slipping? Well, the trailers for Monsters University didn't seem to deny that theory, but I can assure you that the final product is truly satisfying, and here are my reasons:Story: This film serves as a prequel to Monsters, Inc. As much as I liked Monsters, Inc., I never thought that they should make prequel to it. Pixar managed to find a story that would fit for a Monsters, Inc. prequel. The idea for a movie about Mike and Sulley in college is not only funny, but Pixar made a story that would take surprising turns that you wouldn't expect in a comedy centered around college.Writing: The movie is hilarious, especially in the sense that they made Sulley an arrogant, reckless college student. Once again, they also get rather serious at a point, which reminds me of the old Pixar that made masterpieces like the Toy Story trilogy, The Incredibles, Up, etc.Animation: It's been a while since I've been impressed by animation, but this film really did it for me! The burst of color and detail is incredible, and it's just great to see this classic characters brought to life with modern animation.Voice Acting: John Goodman and Billy Crystal return (along with some other familiar voices and characters) as the starring roles of this film, and they do the job as good as they used to. There are some new voices too, which are also really good at their jobs.Verdict: Monsters University gives me hope for Pixar. I hope that they continue to make movies this good, and hopefully make some modern classics like they used to. This was a movie I had to see twice to fully appreciate, and it's still not a classic, but it was a lot of fun. I definitely recommend watching this film!Final Score: 8.8 out of 10.",4,School is Cool... if You're a Monster,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,1848,"['Cars', '2', 'Brave', 'were', ""n't"", 'BAD', 'worse', 'average', 'Pixar', 'started', 'fear', 'future', 'Pixar', 'Could', 'actually', 'be', 'slipping', 'Well', 'trailers', 'Monsters', 'University', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'deny', 'theory', 'can', 'assure', 'final', 'product', 'truly', 'satisfying', 'here', 'are', 'reasons', 'Story', 'film', 'prequel', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'As', 'much', 'liked', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'never', 'thought', 'should', 'make', 'prequel', 'Pixar', 'managed', 'find', 'story', 'would', 'fit', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'prequel', 'idea', 'movie', 'Mike', 'Sulley', 'college', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'Pixar', 'made', 'story', 'would', 'take', 'surprising', 'turns', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'comedy', 'centered', 'college.Writing', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'sense', 'made', 'Sulley', 'arrogant', 'reckless', 'college', 'student', 'Once', 'again', 'also', 'get', 'rather', 'serious', 'point', 'old', 'Pixar', 'made', 'masterpieces', 'Toy', 'Story', 'trilogy', 'Incredibles', 'Up', 'etc.Animation', 'been', 'while', ""'ve"", 'been', 'impressed', 'animation', 'film', 'really', 'did', 'burst', 'color', 'detail', 'incredible', 'just', 'great', 'see', 'classic', 'characters', 'brought', 'life', 'modern', 'animation.Voice', 'Acting', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'return', 'other', 'familiar', 'voices', 'characters', 'starring', 'roles', 'film', 'do', 'job', 'as', 'good', 'used', 'are', 'new', 'voices', 'too', 'are', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'jobs.Verdict', 'Monsters', 'University', 'hope', 'Pixar', 'hope', 'continue', 'make', 'movies', 'good', 'hopefully', 'make', 'modern', 'classics', 'used', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'see', 'twice', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'still', 'not', 'classic', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'Final', 'Score', '8.8', '10']",N/A

1562589,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B008JFUPOY,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 0]","Even with films like CARS 2, Pixar is still a studio that makes charming films. It's highly unlikely that will ever change. While the CARS films are widely considered the bottom of the Pixar barrel (and with good reason), they're still better than most of the other animated family fare out there. But in what seems to be more and more of the heyday of Pixar seems to perhaps be passing us by as the films seem to skirt a fine line between the clever, thoughtful, heartfelt and intelligent Pixar fare and the more bland, immature, and solely product-based Disney fare. But last year gave us the very strong BRAVE and this year gives us MONSTERS UNIVERSITY, the prequel to the fantastic MONSTERS, INC., and while the film doesn't give us everything we would want from a Pixar film, it does give us everything we need.Basically, this is the story of how Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman) first meet at the prestigious Monsters University, and how they start out adversaries and wind up best friends. It's also a very well-told lesson about the long shots, and how the things that make us unique are the things that can make us great, even if the greatness isn't obvious. As MONSTERS, INC shows more of a even-handed approach between Mike and Sulley, MU is very much Mike's film as it shows him from a child first visiting Monsters, Incorporated and believing that he's going to be one of the great scarers despite the fact that he's just a big lime with one eye. And then Sulley arrives on the scene, the son of one of the great scarers of all time, intending to coast through on his legacy and on his inherent scariness. But as the film progresses, they both find themselves kicked out of the scarer program and forced to join a fraternity of ""losers"" in order to compete in a school-wide competition that will allow them back in the scarer program. Popping up here also is Randall (Steve Buscemi), the villain of the first film, starting as an innocent geeky kid looking to get in good with the cool kids, and we also get characters like Dean Hardscrabble (Dame Helen Mirren), who is the straitlaced and very intimidating dean of the school, and the class snob Johnny (Nathan Fillion), the head of the coolest frat on campus.The film is filled with great voice talent, such as Aubrey Plaza, Dave Foley, Sean Hayes, and Alfred Molina, but the story itself runs a little on cruise control. For those familiar with the Pixar formula, the film plays out much as you'd expect with the focus of the story being less on the ""winning"" and more on the relationships made and the characters' growth along the way. The film also brings some neat little throwbacks to other collegiate films, such as a nice nod to ANIMAL HOUSE that will leave the parents laughing much more than the kids. And as always, the film looks stupendous. There is no detail that is too small for them to skimp on. However, the film lacks any kind of real bravura visual storytelling, like the fantastic sequence at the end of the first film with the ""door"" chase scene. There's not as much imagination at work here in this film. It looks great, it makes you laugh, it makes you feel, and occasionally, it makes you think, but any real excitement seems perfunctory, and even though the climax is interesting, it's just not that imaginative. Another misstep is the fact that the film does ignore a key element of Sulley's backstory. Why did director Dan Scanlon not see that as something essential to the film? Growing up as the son of a legendary scarer is something that has relevance to all kids and adults who had to grow up in the shadow of a strong and beloved authority figure, and is something that would have made MONSTERS UNIVERSITY much stronger.While MONSTERS UNIVERSITY is a fine, solid addition to Pixar's film library, it's a little on the forgettable side as it plays for a more family-friendly message and stays away from some of the scarier bits of what it means to be a monster.",4,"Long on Charm, but Short on Ingenuity",1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,4001,"['Even', 'films', 'CARS', '2', 'Pixar', 'still', 'studio', 'charming', 'films', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'will', 'ever', 'change', 'CARS', 'films', 'are', 'widely', 'considered', 'bottom', 'Pixar', 'barrel', 'good', 'reason', ""'re"", 'still', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'animated', 'family', 'fare', 'there', 'what', 'be', 'more', 'more', 'heyday', 'Pixar', 'perhaps', 'be', 'passing', 'films', 'seem', 'skirt', 'fine', 'line', 'clever', 'thoughtful', 'heartfelt', 'intelligent', 'Pixar', 'fare', 'more', 'bland', 'immature', 'solely', 'product-based', 'Disney', 'fare', 'last', 'year', 'gave', 'very', 'strong', 'BRAVE', 'year', 'MONSTERS', 'UNIVERSITY', 'prequel', 'fantastic', 'MONSTERS', 'INC.', 'film', ""n't"", 'give', 'everything', 'would', 'want', 'Pixar', 'film', 'give', 'everything', 'need.Basically', 'story', 'how', 'Mike', 'Wazowski', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'James', 'P.', 'Sulley', 'Sullivan', 'John', 'Goodman', 'first', 'meet', 'prestigious', 'Monsters', 'University', 'how', 'start', 'adversaries', 'wind', 'up', 'best', 'friends', 'also', 'very', 'well-told', 'lesson', 'long', 'shots', 'how', 'things', 'make', 'unique', 'are', 'things', 'can', 'make', 'great', 'even', 'greatness', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'MONSTERS', 'INC', 'more', 'even-handed', 'approach', 'Mike', 'Sulley', 'MU', 'very', 'much', 'Mike', 'film', 'child', 'first', 'visiting', 'Monsters', 'Incorporated', 'believing', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'scarers', 'fact', 'just', 'big', 'lime', 'one', 'eye', 'then', 'Sulley', 'scene', 'son', 'one', 'great', 'scarers', 'time', 'intending', 'coast', 'legacy', 'inherent', 'scariness', 'film', 'find', 'kicked', 'scarer', 'program', 'forced', 'join', 'fraternity', 'losers', 'order', 'compete', 'school-wide', 'competition', 'will', 'allow', 'back', 'scarer', 'program', 'Popping', 'up', 'here', 'also', 'Randall', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'villain', 'first', 'film', 'starting', 'innocent', 'geeky', 'kid', 'looking', 'get', 'good', 'cool', 'kids', 'also', 'get', 'characters', 'Dean', 'Hardscrabble', 'Dame', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'straitlaced', 'very', 'intimidating', 'dean', 'school', 'class', 'snob', 'Johnny', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'head', 'coolest', 'frat', 'campus.The', 'film', 'filled', 'great', 'voice', 'talent', 'such', 'Aubrey', 'Plaza', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'story', 'little', 'cruise', 'control', 'familiar', 'Pixar', 'formula', 'film', 'out', 'much', ""'d"", 'expect', 'focus', 'story', 'being', 'less', 'winning', 'more', 'relationships', 'made', 'characters', 'growth', 'way', 'film', 'also', 'neat', 'little', 'throwbacks', 'other', 'collegiate', 'films', 'such', 'nice', 'nod', 'ANIMAL', 'HOUSE', 'will', 'leave', 'parents', 'laughing', 'much', 'more', 'kids', 'always', 'film', 'stupendous', 'detail', 'too', 'small', 'skimp', 'However', 'film', 'kind', 'real', 'bravura', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'fantastic', 'sequence', 'end', 'first', 'film', 'door', 'chase', 'scene', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'imagination', 'work', 'here', 'film', 'great', 'feel', 'occasionally', 'think', 'real', 'excitement', 'perfunctory', 'even', 'climax', 'interesting', 'just', 'not', 'imaginative', 'misstep', 'fact', 'film', 'ignore', 'key', 'element', 'Sulley', 'backstory', 'Why', 'did', 'director', 'Dan', 'Scanlon', 'not', 'see', 'something', 'essential', 'film', 'Growing', 'up', 'son', 'legendary', 'scarer', 'something', 'relevance', 'kids', 'adults', 'who', 'had', 'grow', 'up', 'shadow', 'strong', 'beloved', 'authority', 'figure', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'MONSTERS', 'UNIVERSITY', 'much', 'MONSTERS', 'UNIVERSITY', 'fine', 'solid', 'addition', 'Pixar', 'film', 'library', 'little', 'forgettable', 'side', 'more', 'family-friendly', 'message', 'away', 'scarier', 'bits', 'what', 'be', 'monster']",N/A

Being a student at Monsters University gives him that chance, except no one there thinks he's scary enough. The over-confident Sullivan (John Goodman) is the monster everyone sees potential in but he thinks he doesn't even have to try because his family name is already legendary.The two compete over who's scarier and can't stand each other. However, when they both get kicked out of scare class, they have no choice but to team up with an oddball fraternity in a scare games competition. If they win, they are back in scare class, if they lose, they are out of Monsters University.Kids who aren't familiar with underdog movies or an adult fraternity movie might enjoy it more than grown-ups. While in Monster's Inc, Mike said he knew Sullivan since the 4th grade, not college which is another flaw. Despite flaws and the plot not being extremely fresh, the film does have plenty of charm though and preaches a good lesson about being yourself. But it's predictable, while Pixar still hasn't done anything too special since Toy Story 3.

1562626,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B008JFUPOY,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[39, 58]","***This review may contain spoilers.***Like ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Monsters University"" (MU) won't win any recognition for its originality.  Relating the tale of the first encounter between all-eye green cyclops Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and blue, hulking, bear-like James ""Sully"" Sullivan (John Goodman) at the titular institute of higher ""scare"" learning, MU cribs all over the place.  As other posters have noticed, MU borrows fragments of other college-themed movies like ""Animal House"", the Harry Potter movie heptology (seven films), and even a smidgen of ""Back to School"".  Most tellingly, however, MU is heavily in debt to ""The Hunger Games"", since the meets held to determine which monster fraternities will be eliminated from the prestigious ""scare curriculum"" and even from the university take up the bulk of the film.  MU robustly and hilariously satirizes the aspects of college and frat life you would expect, but later reveals unexpected insights about the limits of desire, determination, and knowledge, and learning what your true place in the world is.""Monsters, Inc."" focused largely on Sully.  This time, in MU, Mike is mostly in the spotlight.  We first see him as an appealing schoolkid (voiced by Noah Johnston) with huge aspirations to become a top scarer at the scare factory.  Little Mike is sharp enough, and studious enough in...""scareology""... I guess to earn a place at the university.  However, he faces two tough obstacles. One, although Mike may have nailed the cerebral, technical aspects of scaring, he may not really be inherently scary.  Two, the imperious and disdainful Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren), a cross between a dragon, a praying mantis, and a centipede, candidly and harshly tells Mike he is not a scarer.There may be a third obstacle.  Sully is also attending the university, but he is literally a goof-off party animal because he thinks his family ""scaring"" pedigree will get him through.  So obviously, and perhaps predictably, Mike and Sully aren't friends at first sight.  At first, they're not even dorm mates (at least that clich&eacute; is avoided for a while); Mike is first paired with Randall ""Randy"" Boggs, the later reptilian invisible monster in ""Monsters, Inc.""  That soon changes as an assembly mishap involving a cherished scare canister forces the irate Dean to eject Mike and Sully from the ""scare curriculum"" and pair them off as opposite roommates at the unpopular Oozma Kappa (OK) fraternity.OKs members are middle-aged squid-like former salesmonster Don (Joel Murry), the bickering two-headed Terri/Terry (Sean Hayes/Dave Foley), the five-eyed Flounder-like Scott (Peter Sohn), and ex-con elbow-macaroni shaped Art (Charlie Day). Even though OK is kinda nerdy and non-scary, Mike convinces the Dean to allow the OK frat to compete in the ""Scare Games""; if they survive the games, all of OKs members stay in the scare curriculum; if they don't survive, Mike, and perhaps Sully will be sent packing.  Will OK be OK enough to do it?  Will Mike and Sully realize their ""scare dreams""?Again, on the surface, MU plays with the framework of the college/fraternity movie and seems to be going where you think it's going.  But MU is somewhat surprisingly subtler and deeper than that.  It suggests that drive, persistence, hard work and book knowledge are good things to have, but do not necessarily take you where you want to go.  Sometimes serendipity intervenes and shows you your true path in life (it's a ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" thing). Also, those same qualities alone may not predict success; additional qualities such as cunning, cleverness, and ""misdirection"" can come in handy. MU also suggests that even the most outwardly self-assured people hide reservoirs of self-doubt and fear.  However, teamwork and mental focus can overcome those fears and perform amazing feats than no one person can hope to achieve. Most importantly, MU demonstrates that failure can be the steppingstones to ultimate triumph.  We know from ""Monsters, Inc."" that Mike and Sully succeeded in getting jobs at the ""scare"" factory. MU shows the surprising steppingstones they took to get there.",5,"Even though It's A Prequel, ""Monsters University"" Continues to Surprise Us With Profound Insights",1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,4139,"['***This', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Monsters', 'University', 'MU', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'recognition', 'originality', 'Relating', 'tale', 'first', 'encounter', 'all-eye', 'green', 'cyclops', 'Mike', 'Wazowski', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'blue', 'hulking', 'bear-like', 'James', 'Sully', 'Sullivan', 'John', 'Goodman', 'titular', 'institute', 'higher', 'scare', 'learning', 'MU', 'cribs', 'place', 'other', 'posters', 'have', 'noticed', 'MU', 'fragments', 'other', 'college-themed', 'movies', 'Animal', 'House', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'heptology', 'seven', 'films', 'even', 'smidgen', 'Back', 'School', 'Most', 'tellingly', 'however', 'MU', 'heavily', 'debt', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'meets', 'held', 'determine', 'monster', 'fraternities', 'will', 'be', 'eliminated', 'prestigious', 'scare', 'curriculum', 'even', 'university', 'take', 'up', 'bulk', 'film', 'MU', 'robustly', 'hilariously', 'aspects', 'college', 'frat', 'life', 'would', 'expect', 'later', 'reveals', 'unexpected', 'insights', 'limits', 'desire', 'determination', 'knowledge', 'learning', 'what', 'true', 'place', 'world', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'focused', 'largely', 'Sully', 'time', 'MU', 'Mike', 'mostly', 'spotlight', 'first', 'see', 'appealing', 'schoolkid', 'voiced', 'Noah', 'Johnston', 'huge', 'aspirations', 'become', 'top', 'scarer', 'scare', 'factory', 'Little', 'Mike', 'sharp', 'enough', 'studious', 'enough', 'scareology', 'guess', 'earn', 'place', 'university', 'However', 'two', 'tough', 'obstacles', 'One', 'Mike', 'may', 'have', 'nailed', 'cerebral', 'technical', 'aspects', 'scaring', 'may', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'inherently', 'scary', 'Two', 'imperious', 'disdainful', 'Dean', 'Hardscrabble', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'cross', 'dragon', 'praying', 'mantis', 'centipede', 'candidly', 'harshly', 'tells', 'not', 'scarer.There', 'may', 'be', 'third', 'obstacle', 'Sully', 'also', 'attending', 'university', 'literally', 'goof-off', 'party', 'animal', 'family', 'scaring', 'pedigree', 'will', 'get', 'So', 'obviously', 'perhaps', 'predictably', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'are', ""n't"", 'friends', 'first', 'sight', 'first', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'dorm', 'mates', 'least', 'clich', 'eacute', 'avoided', 'while', 'Mike', 'first', 'paired', 'Randall', 'Randy', 'Boggs', 'later', 'reptilian', 'invisible', 'monster', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'soon', 'assembly', 'mishap', 'involving', 'cherished', 'scare', 'canister', 'irate', 'Dean', 'eject', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'scare', 'curriculum', 'pair', 'off', 'opposite', 'roommates', 'unpopular', 'Oozma', 'Kappa', 'OK', 'fraternity.OKs', 'members', 'are', 'middle-aged', 'squid-like', 'former', 'salesmonster', 'Don', 'Joel', 'Murry', 'bickering', 'two-headed', 'Terri/Terry', 'Sean', 'Hayes/Dave', 'Foley', 'five-eyed', 'Flounder-like', 'Scott', 'Peter', 'Sohn', 'ex-con', 'elbow-macaroni', 'shaped', 'Art', 'Charlie', 'Day', 'Even', 'OK', 'kinda', 'nerdy', 'non-scary', 'Mike', 'Dean', 'allow', 'OK', 'frat', 'compete', 'Scare', 'Games', 'survive', 'games', 'OKs', 'members', 'stay', 'scare', 'curriculum', 'do', ""n't"", 'survive', 'Mike', 'perhaps', 'Sully', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'packing', 'Will', 'OK', 'be', 'OK', 'enough', 'do', 'Will', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'realize', 'scare', 'dreams', 'Again', 'surface', 'MU', 'framework', 'college/fraternity', 'movie', 'be', 'going', 'where', 'think', 'going', 'MU', 'somewhat', 'surprisingly', 'subtler', 'deeper', 'drive', 'persistence', 'hard', 'work', 'book', 'knowledge', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'have', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'take', 'where', 'want', 'go', 'Sometimes', 'serendipity', 'intervenes', 'true', 'path', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'thing', 'Also', 'same', 'qualities', 'alone', 'may', 'not', 'predict', 'success', 'additional', 'qualities', 'such', 'cunning', 'cleverness', 'misdirection', 'can', 'come', 'handy', 'MU', 'also', 'even', 'most', 'outwardly', 'self-assured', 'people', 'hide', 'reservoirs', 'self-doubt', 'fear', 'However', 'teamwork', 'mental', 'focus', 'can', 'overcome', 'fears', 'perform', 'amazing', 'feats', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'hope', 'achieve', 'Most', 'importantly', 'MU', 'failure', 'can', 'be', 'steppingstones', 'ultimate', 'triumph', 'know', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'succeeded', 'getting', 'jobs', 'scare', 'factory', 'MU', 'surprising', 'steppingstones', 'took', 'get', 'there']",N/A

1562629,A3F9VH8916IA40,B008JFUPOY,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[10, 15]","Dumb me! Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb me! All summer I put my faith and hope in the big blockbuster films, the Iron Man 3's and Star Treks of the world. And from Man of Steel to Pacific Rim almost without fail these over budgeted, underwritten explosiony action films left me feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. Except for World War Z there is not a single movie I've seen this summer that I can truly say was a great film. Some were better than others (Oblivion and Pacific Rim were both pretty good) but considering their competition was Iron Man 3 and Star Trek Into Darkness that's not saying much. All the while I put off seeing Monsters U for weeks. ""It looks silly"" I said, ""Pixar has lost its mojo"" the idiot side of my brain insisted. Well, that sure teaches me. I will never doubt Pixar again. Even if they make another mediocre film like Brave, they have more than proven themselves still capable of making a damn good film.Wall E will always be my favorite Pixar film, and Toy Story 2 will always be my second, but fighting for third place for a long time has been Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, the original Toy Story, and Up. That is the kind of company Monsters U is keeping. It does everything right, from delivering plenty incredibly funny moments balanced with the kind of emotionally powerful and heartfelt scenes that have made Pixar a household name. This movie is so funny I chocked on my popcorn. I haven't laughed this hard in a movie since 21 Jump Street. And it wasn't that cheap appeal to the lowest denominator type humor either. There aren't any fart jokes, poop jokes, inside innuendos about sex or drugs. None of that nonsense here. This is good old fashioned honest to God comedy that's drop dead hilariousness and perfectly appropriate for all ages. When you hear kids laughing in the theaters along me, a 24 year old man, you know its comedy gold. It's because the characters carry the story, and when you have a story driven by strong characters you have a good film. Mike and Sully aren't the only ones delivering laughs, as just about everyone gets in on the action.Mike and Sully, much like in the original film, star as the main roles but their relationship isn't quite the same. They start the film as heated rivals: Mike is an underdog overachiever who's devoted his entire life to becoming a scarer despite the fact that he's not even remotely scary, while Sully is the son of a famous scarer who's had everything in life handed to him and makes no effort whatsoever in applying himself. Sully has all the natural skill in the world but none of the motivation or drive to apply himself. Mike on the other hand lacks any sort of natural skill. He isn't scary, he's built like a lovable beach ball, he can't roar, but his drive and motivation makes him able to compete with some of the best scarers on campus. It's very Rudy like in that regard, and though not entirely original the way the story is told is Pixar magic at its finest. And like Rudy it teaches us a very valuable lesson that people of all ages can relate to, that despite ones physical limitations, even of those limitations preclude you from achieving something you've wanted your entire life, with enough hard work, dedication, and the right attitude you can very well succeed at what you wanted, even if it's not quite in the way you imagined. Who can't relate to that? Who here wanted to be an athlete when they grew up but didn't have the physical capability to compete past High School? : raises hand: As adults we've all experienced this at one time or another. You wanted to be an actor, an athlete, a musician, something, but despite your hard work and dedication it was just never meant to be. So I sympathize with Mike, as I imagine most audience members will.At the other end of the spectrum we have Sully, who presents a cool and collected face to the world but is living with the weight of high expectations. His father is a world class scarer, a legend, and so Sully has a lot to live up to. His pedigree makes him blind to his own limitations and the need for improvement while also placing a burden upon him he's terrified of not living up to. He's brash, arrogant, a know it all, but as time goes on and failures pile on top of failures he learns that pedigree is not enough, that without actual effort your natural skills won't mean much of anything. Life won't give you a pass because you are the son of so and so or because you can roar really loud. Eventually you're going to be put to the test, and forced to compete against those of equal or greater natural ability. When that happens it's the ones that apply themselves the most who will succeed. It was great to see Sully's development in this way from hot shot know it all to humble and hardworking individual. I'm telling you there is more depth, growth, and subtlety to these characters then all the summer action films combined. It's not even close.The animation in this film is the best CGI I've ever seen. For the scenes set in our world I would have to remind myself this was an animated movie. There is a scene when Mike and Sully are sitting by a lake with the moon hovering over them that looks like it could have been shot live action. It's that amazing. If not for the cartoon monsters I might not have been able to tell the difference. This applies to the very well made short, The Blue Umbrella that kicks the movie off. Pixar has always been a pioneer for animation but this is their best, more realistic work yet.Monsters U is nothing short of a masterpiece. If this were any other studio I'd present this film as their masterpiece, but along with Japanese Studio Ghibli I don't think any studio has such a consistent level of success with almost every film they make. It's merely one of many dozens of fantastic movies by an amazing studio that deserves to be seen. If you've not seen it yet, make a point to do so. You will not be disappointed.Replay value: High.",5,PIXAR returns to its magical ways,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,5972,"['Dumb', 'Dumb', 'dumb', 'dumb', 'dumb', 'dumb', 'dumb', 'summer', 'put',

1562630,A1L5WAZAL5H1SA,B008JFUPOY,Jon (Scott Reads It!),"[3, 5]","I remember seeing Monsters Inc. in theaters when it first came out. I was absolutely obsessed with it and it was one of the best family movies I had ever seen. Fast-forward a couple of years and I heard news that there was going to be a prequel to Monsters Inc. I'll admit it that I was pretty skeptical and I didn't really see the need for a prequel. I had thought that a prequel was kind of ridiculous because Monsters Inc. could be a perfect stand-alone. After seeing Monsters University, I realized how essential it is to the viewer that we get the backstories of Mike, Sulley, and Randall.Monsters University has proven to me that Pixar can still make amazing, emotional films. Cars 2 was one of the most disappointing movies I had ever seen and I was worried that somehow Pixar would botch Monsters University. Monsters University is a fun movie that the whole family enjoy and it's impossible not to be entranced by this touching story. MU hits all the right notes and is not only emotional but it's also an extremely entertaining film. I loved watching Mike and Sulley slowly develop into the characters that I loved in Monsters Inc. It was also interesting to see how much Randall transformed from the beginning of MU to the end. I definitely would have liked to see more of Randall and how MU changed him.Even if you aren't familiar with Monsters Inc., Monsters University is still a treat! With it's stunning visual animation, spot-on acting by John Goodman and Billy Crystal, laugh-out-loud humor, and touching moments, it's impossible not to become a fan of the franchise. If you go in to MU, without seeing Monsters Inc. I'm almost 100% positive that you'll want to see Monsters Inc. right afterwards. Monsters University is definitely a noteworthy movie and it was well-worth the 12 years or so wait. Pixar has out-done themselves once again and I can't imagine them making another movie like Cars 2 ever again after seeing MU.Could there be another Monsters Inc. film? There very well could be even though Monsters University wrapped up nicely. I would love to see another Monsters Inc. movie only if it's executed well. Pixar stills knows how to make a terrific movie that people of all ages will love. I'm so excited to see what Pixar has in store next and I hope I enjoy it as much I enjoyed MU. I'd highly, highly recommend seeing MU and it surpassed any expectations that I had for this prequel. I definitely plan on seeing it again once it releases on DVD.",5,A Superb Prequel!,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,2478,"['remember', 'seeing', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'theaters', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'absolutely', 'obsessed', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'family', 'movies', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'Fast-forward', 'couple', 'years', 'heard', 'news', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'prequel', 'Monsters', 'Inc', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'pretty', 'skeptical', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'need', 'prequel', 'had', 'thought', 'prequel', 'was', 'kind', 'ridiculous', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'could', 'be', 'perfect', 'stand-alone', 'seeing', 'Monsters', 'University', 'realized', 'how', 'essential', 'viewer', 'get', 'backstories', 'Mike', 'Sulley', 'Randall.Monsters', 'University', 'proven', 'Pixar', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'amazing', 'emotional', 'films', 'Cars', '2', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'disappointing', 'movies', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'worried', 'somehow', 'Pixar', 'would', 'botch', 'Monsters', 'University', 'Monsters', 'University', 'fun', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'enjoy', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'entranced', 'touching', 'story', 'MU', 'right', 'notes', 'not', 'only', 'emotional', 'also', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'film', 'loved', 'watching', 'Mike', 'Sulley', 'slowly', 'develop', 'characters', 'loved', 'Monsters', 'Inc', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'Randall', 'transformed', 'beginning', 'MU', 'end', 'definitely', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'Randall', 'how', 'MU', 'changed', 'him.Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Monsters', 'University', 'still', 'treat', 'stunning', 'visual', 'animation', 'spot-on', 'acting', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'laugh-out-loud', 'humor', 'touching', 'moments', 'impossible', 'not', 'become', 'fan', 'franchise', 'go', 'MU', 'seeing', 'Monsters', 'Inc', ""'m"", 'almost', '100', '%', 'positive', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'right', 'afterwards', 'Monsters', 'University', 'definitely', 'noteworthy', 'movie', 'was', 'well-worth', '12', 'years', 'so', 'wait', 'Pixar', 'out-done', 'once', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'making', 'movie', 'Cars', '2', 'ever', 'again', 'seeing', 'MU.Could', 'there', 'be', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'even', 'Monsters', 'University', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nicely', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'movie', 'only', 'executed', 'well', 'Pixar', 'how', 'make', 'terrific', 'movie', 'people', 'ages', 'will', 'love', ""'m"", 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'Pixar', 'store', 'next', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'MU', ""'d"", 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'MU', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'had', 'prequel', 'definitely', 'plan', 'seeing', 'again', 'DVD']",N/A

But the people at Pixar have quite the talent and deliver a great movie once again.Monsters University starts out with the loveable Mike Wazowski as a boy. He is the kid in the class no one wants to really be around or be friends with; but as Mike enters college you realize that although he has a very likeable determination, he is missing one key quality as a monster. It is in college where Mike meets his eventual nemesis Randy Boggs, and his soon to be friend James Sulley Sullivan. As the story progresses, it is becomes obvious that Mike has the knowledge, and the determination, and Sulley has the quality that Mike needs. The acting is awesome yet again, the story is well thought up and there is a lot of scare for everyone.My final thoughts and closing remarks for this review will be: Monsters University does succeed as a prequel; as great as Pixar is, my only hope is that they consider making a sequel to Monsters Inc. and The Incredibles.

1562658,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B008JFUPOY,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","Over the years I have always enjoyed Pixar's films.  They maintained a consistently high quality with their movies, with cutting-edge animation, well-written stories, and unusual but clever concepts.  And I greatly enjoyed ""Monsters Inc.,"" which had a creative (if not entirely original) premise -- that the monsters in the closet are real, but are simply doing their job instead of scaring children out of malice.  The filmmakers built a fascinating alternate world and populated it with imaginatively designed, well-rounded characters that are hard not to like, and though the film ended on a satisfying note, it did leave an entire world behind that could have been fascinating to explore.""Monsters University"" is a prequel to ""Monsters Inc.,"" and I was eager to learn more about the heroes of the first movie, Mike and Sully.  But this movie fell flat for me, and though entertaining enough, it doesn't hold the same sort of charm as the first film does.This film takes place several years before the events of ""Monsters Inc.,"" and starts off with a younger Mike attending college to fulfill his dream of becoming a scarer.  He finds himself rooming with his future nemesis Randall (here portrayed as an awkward but good-natured nerd) and studying hard to master various scaring techniques.  But he almost instantly finds himself butting heads with Sully, a jerk-ish slacker who figures he can coast by on natural talent and his family name.  When their antics get them kicked out of the scare program, they join a fraternity of misfits and set out to win the college's prestigious Scare Games in order to win their way back into the program.  But both monsters have their work cut out for them -- their fraternity is made up of the least scary students on campus, the dean of the college has a harsh eye on them, and they have to overcome their dislike of each other before they can hope to win...As always, the animation is outstanding.  Pixar is constantly pushing the envelope when it comes to the visuals and animation of its films, and while this film maintains the look and feel of its predecessor, it's also much more visually detailed.  There's an even larger variety of monsters in this film than in the last, giving us a look at the rich diversity of the monster world and even some of its wildlife (such as a two-headed pigeon in the opening scene and a six-legged pig that's the mascot of a rival school).  The film is bright and colorful, and sure to catch the eyes of children watching it.The story itself, however, is a tired retread of other college films.  The story feels like a family-friendly version of ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" with some elements of ""Animal House"" and ""Pitch Perfect"" thrown in.  If the filmmakers had been able to do something fresh and new with the ""characters go to college"" plot this would have been bearable, but simply making a college movie with monsters doesn't automatically make it a new and interesting film.  And while I'm not above aiming an animated film at a more adult audience, the ""Monsters"" franchise was always aimed more at children, and I doubt many young kids are going to find a college movie interesting.My biggest beef with the movie is the main characters.  They don't act much like their ""Monsters Inc."" selves, and while one can attribute this to the fact that this is a prequel and there's been some character development over the years, it's still quite jarring.  Mike was a delightfully snarky and neurotic character in ""Monsters Inc.,"" but here he's been turned into a hyperactive nerd.  Sully's change is even more shocking -- he's gone from the friendly and soft-hearted character of the first movie to an arrogant jock who treats Mike and everyone else like dirt.  Randall, too, acts completely different from how he did in the first movie -- he's a dorky but good-natured nerd instead of a sadistic and vengeful rival to Sully -- but at least his transition is shown in this movie, albeit in a somewhat clunky manner.The movie was cute and I did enjoy some of the new characters (Art and Dean Hardscrabble especially), but I felt it was a serious misstep from Pixar and not up to their usual standard.  Still, I am hoping that they decide to revisit this world someday with a sequel.  Perhaps a movie about the further adventures of Mike and Sully beyond ""Monsters Inc."" will be more interesting than their college days...",3,"""Revenge of the Nerds"" with monsters -- cute premise but tired story",1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,4401,"['years', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Pixar', 'films', 'maintained', 'consistently', 'high', 'quality', 'movies', 'cutting-edge', 'animation', 'well-written', 'stories', 'unusual', 'clever', 'concepts', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'had', 'creative', 'not', 'entirely', 'original', 'premise', 'monsters', 'closet', 'are', 'real', 'are', 'simply', 'doing', 'job', 'instead', 'scaring', 'children', 'malice', 'filmmakers', 'built', 'fascinating', 'alternate', 'world', 'populated', 'imaginatively', 'designed', 'well-rounded', 'characters', 'are', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'ended', 'satisfying', 'note', 'did', 'leave', 'entire', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'explore', 'Monsters', 'University', 'prequel', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'was', 'eager', 'learn', 'more', 'heroes', 'first', 'movie', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'movie', 'fell', 'flat', 'entertaining', 'enough', ""n't"", 'hold', 'same', 'sort', 'charm', 'first', 'film', 'does.This', 'film', 'several', 'years', 'events', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'off', 'younger', 'Mike', 'attending', 'college', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'becoming', 'scarer', 'rooming', 'future', 'nemesis', 'Randall', 'here', 'portrayed', 'awkward', 'good-natured', 'nerd', 'studying', 'hard', 'master', 'various', 'scaring', 'techniques', 'almost', 'instantly', 'butting', 'heads', 'Sully', 'jerk-ish', 'slacker', 'who', 'can', 'coast', 'natural', 'talent', 'family', 'name', 'When', 'antics', 'get', 'kicked', 'scare', 'program', 'join', 'fraternity', 'misfits', 'set', 'out', 'win', 'college', 'prestigious', 'Scare', 'Games', 'order', 'win', 'way', 'back', 'program', 'monsters', 'have', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'fraternity', 'made', 'least', 'scary', 'students', 'campus', 'dean', 'college', 'harsh', 'eye', 'have', 'overcome', 'dislike', 'other', 'can', 'hope', 'win', 'always', 'animation', 'outstanding', 'Pixar', 'constantly', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'when', 'visuals', 'animation', 'films', 'film', 'look', 'feel', 'predecessor', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'visually', 'detailed', 'even', 'larger', 'variety', 'monsters', 'film', 'last', 'giving', 'look', 'rich', 'diversity', 'monster', 'world', 'even', 'wildlife', 'such', 'two-headed', 'pigeon', 'opening', 'scene', 'six-legged', 'pig', 'mascot', 'rival', 'school', 'film', 'bright', 'colorful', 'sure', 'catch', 'eyes', 'children', 'watching', 'it.The', 'story', 'however', 'tired', 'retread', 'other', 'college', 'films', 'story', 'feels', 'family-friendly', 'version', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'elements', 'Animal', 'House', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'thrown', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'something', 'fresh', 'new', 'characters', 'go', 'college', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bearable', 'simply', 'making', 'college', 'movie', 'monsters', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'make', 'new', 'interesting', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'aiming', 'animated', 'film', 'more', 'adult', 'audience', 'Monsters', 'franchise', 'was', 'always', 'aimed', 'more', 'children', 'doubt', 'many', 'young', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'college', 'movie', 'interesting.My', 'biggest', 'beef', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'much', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'selves', 'one', 'can', 'attribute', 'fact', 'prequel', 'been', 'character', 'development', 'years', 'still', 'quite', 'jarring', 'Mike', 'was', 'delightfully', 'snarky', 'neurotic', 'character', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'here', 'been', 'turned', 'hyperactive', 'nerd', 'Sully', 'change', 'even', 'more', 'shocking', 'gone', 'friendly', 'soft-hearted', 'character', 'first', 'movie', 'arrogant', 'jock', 'who', 'Mike', 'everyone', 'else', 'dirt', 'Randall', 'too', 'completely', 'different', 'how', 'did', 'first', 'movie', 'dorky', 'good-natured', 'nerd', 'instead', 'sadistic', 'vengeful', 'rival', 'Sully', 'least', 'transition', 'shown', 'movie', 'albeit', 'somewhat', 'clunky', 'manner.The', 'movie', 'was', 'cute', 'did', 'enjoy', 'new', 'characters', 'Art', 'Dean', 'Hardscrabble', 'especially', 'felt', 'was', 'serious', 'misstep', 'Pixar', 'not', 'usual', 'standard', 'Still', 'am', 'hoping', 'decide', 'revisit', 'world', 'someday', 'sequel', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'further', 'adventures', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'college', 'days']",N/A

It is thoroughly enjoyable to both Children and Families, its ideas were original, and it looked wonderful.Monsters University takes everything that made the original wonderful and added incredible character development, expanded the universe, and most importantly it didn't re-hash the original.The story is simple; a prequel to Monsters Inc, about how Mike and Sulley from the first film met, went to college, and ended up being scarers.One of the most interesting things that this Disney/Pixar film does is that it doesn't end with a necessarily happy ending. Mike is a great student, but when it comes to scaring, he just doesn't have it. Essentially what this film says is that some people are just bred into things and no matter how hard you try you may not have what it takes. a brave move by the writers, and it makes all the difference.Not to mention the fact that it is witty, smart, and the characters are more than one-dimensional. The voice-actors are very good (Nathan Fillion, Helen Mirren), and the characters are dynamic and they develop throughout.This is truly the greatest Disney/Pixar film in a long time.

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[4, 8]","All 3 of my kids (7 year old boy/girl twins and an eight year old) really enjoyed this movie, and my husband and I were mostly entertained too (always a plus in kids' movies.) This is basically a 'prequel' to Monsters inc. - Sulley, Mike, and Randy are all at Monsters University in the 'Scare' program, hoping to qualify to eventually work at Monsters Inc. as scarers. Sulley and Mike can't stand each other on first sight, and because of their rivalry end up both being eliminated from the program. They have to team up for a chance to get back in, and learn all sorts of lessons about teamwork etc. along the way.Most kids won't get the college jokes but that's OK because there's enough going on to keep them entertained, and the college jokes are meant to engage the adults accompanying them. The animation, performances and pacing are all as good as the first film. I do feel that the scare scenes in this one are a bit scarier than in the first film, and that without little 'Boo' (the very young child trapped in the Monster world in Monsters Inc.) this isn't quite as charming a film, and also not as suitable for the very young (ages 2-4 may be frightened, it will depend on the child.)

Baird (Cars, Tangled Ever After) tells the tale of Mike and Scully meeting for the first time at Monster's University. MU is the best school to learn how to be the best scare-er in town. It actually opens with the kindergarten age Mike discovering what an outcast he really is. A loner, not by choice, Mike learns what a lot of kids do in that sometimes being different and teased by your fellow classmates is not easy and often heartbreaking. Mike also learns that having a positive attitude and a definite goal (going to Monster's U) is what will get him through it all.Oh and Steve Buscemi (Boardwalk Empire, Fargo) is back too as Randall, however he's actually kind of a nice guy until a certain competition makes him to be eventually the life-long enemy of Scully for life.Now initially I was expecting the sharp and witty humor of the first film. All the adult-smart, yet funny words of sarcasm, that kept you laughing and moving the story along and with their sharp humor these wonderful characters just didn't hit the mark in this film. This film lacks the spontaneity of what seemed like the best of improve-like repartee between Crystal and Goodman and the story, although simple, just wasn't as interesting.There are some new voices like Nathan FIllion (Castle, Firefly) as the frat house leader who nothing more than an ego centric bully. Sean Hayes (Will & Grace, Bucket List) as a nerdy frat candidate, Dave Foley (A Bug's Life, Newsradio) as another, Alfed Molina (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Sipder-Man 2) as Professor night and the surprise was Helen Murran (The Queen, Hitchcock) playing the nastiest Dean of any school I have ever seen!As far as prequels go, this had a lot missing and again although it does have some cute moments and a subtle heart tug at the end, it was a little less than what I was expecting. I'm sure the kids will enjoy it as the Saturday morning cartoon feel it has, but the adults not so much anymore. The first film Monsters Inc. was amazing, funny, spontaneous, charming, heartfelt and really had a great story, this one lacks all of theat. Sorry - a Pixar film that I was really disappointed in.

The movie shows them meeting (and clashing) in Monster University's screamer program. They are polar opposites, with the completely unfrightening Mike showing an uber-nerd's dedication to tests and book-learning while Sully relies on his size and family name to coast by, without realizing that they are things he has to live up to. Will they ever learn to respect and appreciate each other? Will they get kicked out of MU?The problem with prequels is that we already know how it ends: with the two of them working as the monster world's most successful screamer duo. That means that a movie like this has to find its tension and suspense in the connective tissue. It's never a ""will they? won't they?"" type of thing, but more of a ""how will they?"" This is accomplished by setting up a lot more plot turns than you'd expect to find in an animated (children's?) film. In fact, the plot takes so many turns that the real point of the film -- to show us how Sully and Mike reach success -- is accomplished by a still frame montage at the end (the fourth or fifth montage of the movie, if my memory is correct). Meanwhile, because this is a Pixar film, there are a lot of sight gags, amazingly rendered scenery, goofy strings of dialogue, quasi-cute monster designs, and inside jokes to the first film (as well as a lot of monster-related puns).It's not a bad film. It's fun, takes an interesting approach to its final moral, and has some cute moments. However, it also feels derivative (say hello to yet another movie about a preppy, jock-ish fraternity in contest against the underdog fraternity), and because the story gets redirected about four or five times, it also feels overlong and needlessly complicated. If you think too long or hard about any real part of the film, flaws reveal themselves pretty readily. They're not huge or gaping, but they're there. Even that's acceptable and would still result in a four-star review except that the first film was so perfectly done that this one feels like a very pale imitation of its predecessor. A visual treat and not without its charms, it still fails to fully satisfy.",3,Adorably Phoning It In,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,2320,"['Capitalizing', 'rightly', 'deserved', 'praise', 'success', 'first', 'film', 'Pixar', 'decided', 'make', 'prequel', 'showing', 'how', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'came', 'be', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'monster', 'world', 'energy', 'concern', 'movie', 'meeting', 'clashing', 'Monster', 'University', 'screamer', 'program', 'are', 'polar', 'opposites', 'completely', 'unfrightening', 'Mike', 'showing', 'uber-nerd', 'dedication', 'tests', 'book-learning', 'Sully', 'relies', 'size', 'family', 'name', 'coast', 'realizing', 'are', 'things', 'live', 'up', 'Will', 'ever', 'learn', 'respect', 'appreciate', 'other', 'Will', 'get', 'kicked', 'MU', 'problem', 'prequels', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'two', 'working', 'monster', 'world', 'most', 'successful', 'screamer', 'duo', 'movie', 'find', 'tension', 'suspense', 'connective', 'tissue', 'never', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'type', 'thing', 'more', 'how', 'will', 'accomplished', 'setting', 'up', 'lot', 'more', 'plot', ""'d"", 'expect', 'find', 'animated', 'children', 'film', 'fact', 'plot', 'so', 'many', 'turns', 'real', 'point', 'film', 'show', 'how', 'Sully', 'Mike', 'reach', 'success', 'accomplished', 'still', 'frame', 'montage', 'end', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'montage', 'movie', 'memory', 'correct', 'Meanwhile', 'Pixar', 'film', 'are', 'lot', 'sight', 'gags', 'amazingly', 'rendered', 'scenery', 'goofy', 'strings', 'dialogue', 'quasi-cute', 'monster', 'designs', 'inside', 'jokes', 'first', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'monster-related', 'puns', '.It', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'fun', 'interesting', 'approach', 'final', 'moral', 'cute', 'moments', 'However', 'also', 'derivative', 'say', 'hello', 'yet', 'movie', 'preppy', 'jock-ish', 'fraternity', 'contest', 'underdog', 'fraternity', 'story', 'redirected', 'four', 'five', 'times', 'also', 'overlong', 'needlessly', 'complicated', 'think', 'too', 'long', 'hard', 'real', 'part', 'film', 'flaws', 'reveal', 'pretty', 'readily', ""'re"", 'not', 'huge', 'gaping', ""'re"", 'there', 'Even', 'acceptable', 'would', 'still', 'result', 'four-star', 'review', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'perfectly', 'done', 'one', 'feels', 'very', 'pale', 'imitation', 'predecessor', 'visual', 'treat', 'not', 'charms', 'still', 'fully', 'satisfy']",N/A

Whether he was struggling with his identity after starting a family (""The Incredibles""), raising a son on his own (""Finding Nemo""), or looking for more out of his life than just his job (""Monsters, Inc.""), Pixar's tales are family fun that secretly speak to the dads in the audience.  ""Monsters University"" goes back in time when those dads were unsure of themselves in college to determine what makes the man.And what really does make the man?  Is it his social status?  His appearance?  His degree?  His family lineage? The self-possessed, relentlessly cheerful Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) of ""Monsters, Inc."" is an uncertain young adult here, struggling to be the best Scarer he can be but fighting an uphill battle 'cause he's just so darn cute. James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is a disaffected jock sailing through college by trading on his family's good name. Sure, we know they were best friends in ""Monsters, Inc."" but here they are competitors, with differing ethos that guarantee they're not going to like each other at first.Each character defines his success differently.  Mike studies hard; Sully parties hard.  The fraternities they join reflect their backgrounds, and soon it becomes clear that class isn't the only place to compete -- there's also the Scare Games, a series of physical challenges with the winning fraternity or sorority named the scariest on campus.

At times ""Monsters University"" is a little more frightening than it should be (there's no Boo to remind us see the monsters world is essentially talking stuffed animals) and when its proselytizes the little ones were fidgeting in the theater.What ""Monsters University"" lacks in subtlety it makes up for with earnestness.

However, at the same time, I cannot say that this is one of Pixar&#8217;s strongest films either.  The same can be said for Monster&#8217;s Inc.  I saw Monster&#8217;s Inc. years ago and remember liking it okay, but not being blown away by it either.  I thought it was mediocre.  I think that Monsters&#8217; Inc.  is one of my least favorite Pixar films.  The same can be said for this film.  On its own it is a pretty good film and got some laughs out of me, but compared to many of Pixar&#8217;s past works like, The Incredibles, Wall-E, Finding Nemo,  and the Toy Story films, this one seemed a tad underwhelming.  Those films that I mentioned appealed to both children and adults, while this film gears more towards kids.One of the film&#8217;s problems is that it is very formulaic.  Until the last half hour the story was very clich&eacute; and I knew pretty much how it would play out.  You have the main character, Mike (Billy Crystal), who as a dream to be the scariest monster.  However, he starts out the underdog, is ridiculed by his peers, and has to work his way to the top.  I have seen that many times before.  You also have the extremely cocky best friend, Sullivan (John Goodman), who is very full of himself and has to learn to be more humble.  You also have the other gang of misfits that are there for comic relief and periodically help out.  You also have the rival gang of bullies that the heroes must defeat.  The first hour felt very clich&eacute; to me.However, the last half hour I did not see coming actually.  The part where Mike and Sullivan are trapped in the human world is definitely my favorite part of the movie.  I also like how Mike and Sullivan finally resolve their differences and help each other.  At first I was going to give this film three stars.  However, the ending made me bump up the rating a bit.Overall, Monsters&#8217; University is a fun time at the movies.  Children should love it.

Little else needs to be said about the transfer. It's flawless.EXTRAS: There are a TON of extras!If you like the behind-the-scenes process of filmmaking, the extras here are about as extensive as I've seen before. Not only do the shorts give a background of life on Pixar's campus (Campus Life), but plenty of dedication to each aspect of making the film. Of course, there's also some deleted scenes.What's nice about the scenes is that director Dan Scalon talks you through the scene in detail and why it was cut. They are of course unfinished, but still interesting to see what could have been part of the movie.If I have one complaint, it's the layout of the bonus features menu. Despite the features being on a blu-ray disc, the menu does not operate like a blu-ray menu. Typically, you're able to operate within the menu while the movie (or features) are playing on screen. Instead, you need to return to the menu screen to select the next option. It's a small caveat, but there we go.SPOILERS BELOW. DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM.If you don't care about the end being discussed, then by all means read on...My wife and I saw Monsters University and both loved it. Many of the Top Critics on Rotten Tomatoes however, seemed to miss the point of the film entirely.""This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets."" - Richard Roeper""[It] conforms to [Pixar's] apparent drift toward the average, with toy sales taking priority over originality."" - Liam Lacey""Monsters University is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful."" - Steven Rae""Mostly memorable for being fine but forgettable."" - Betsy SharkeySince 1995, Pixar has dominated computer animated filmmaking. They constantly win Academy Awards (9 nominations, 7 wins for Best Animated Feature) and are universally praised for their efforts by the critics. Nearly each Pixar movie has a handful of lessons or dominant themes it tries to teach and tell.The Toy Story Trilogy (friendship, getting older)A Bug's Life (self-esteem, ingenuity, teamwork)Monster Inc (greed, pride)Finding Nemo (father-son relationship, growing up, letting go)The Incredibles (family values, honor)*Cars and Cars 2 (I'm pretty sure these are just about marketing toys)Ratatouille (friendship, trust, confidence)WALL-E (consumerism, environmentalism)Up (love, living life in the moment)Brave (family values, respect, love, mother-daughter relationship).However, after seeing MU and reading the critical reviews, I was shocked how many reviewers missed the point of the film and the important lessons Pixar chose to address in the film. You could even make the argument that the lessons in MU are more bold than any previous Pixar film. Which leads to why MU is ultimately about failure and why that's okay.Obviously, as this is a movie about college, there are your typical and inherent lessons for the characters (finding your place, growing up, building friendships), but the most important and surprising lesson is watching Mike Wazowski fail. This lesson is a particularly unique and groundbreaking approach for the age groups in Generation Y (Millennial) and Z. Generational scholar and author Ron Alsop argued that the Millennial generation is a group of ""trophy kids"", who were given rewards just for participating. I'm a Millennial and like many of my friends growing up, we all received gold stars on our homework, ribbons for events, etc. constantly rewarding us for just doing our job. You could also argue we've been constantly told that we could achieve anything we want if we just worked hard. We were told there was no way we could fail. This is the definitive issue that MU tackles head-on.From the age of little monster, Mike is enthralled with the career of being a scarer - the job that every monster dreams of. It's for the cream of the crop. Mike is told continually as a small monster that he's too small and not scary enough to succeed. It's only after he sneaks into a live door on the Monsters, Inc. scare floor that people believe he's capable of great things. He uses that moment to work hard and get into Monsters University to study at the School of Scaring.The main plot is the competitive nature between the hard-working Mike and the famous-last-name Sullivan. Their antagonistic rivalry drives the story until they are forced to work together to get back into the School of Scaring. Like all feel good movies, Mike and Sullivan ultimately save the day, win the Scare Games and are cheered and admired amongst everyone at the school. They defeat the oppressive Dean and defy expectations, the day is theirs! But it's right that that the writers (Robert L. Baird, Daniel Gerson, Dan Scanlon) drastically changes things.Sullivan admits to cheating to help his team of lovable losers win and save face for Mike who he believes isn't scary. When Mike finds out, he breaks into the door testing laboratory to prove to himself that he is indeed scary. However, he quickly learns that he does not in fact scare the kids in the cabin. Crushed, Mike goes to the nearby lake and wallows in self-pity. Everything he's dreamed about and worked for has been for naught - he's failed to be scary, what society tells them is the only thing monsters should be. In the end Mike accepts this and along with Sully works his way from the mailroom at Monsters Inc. to the scare floor where we find him and Sully in Monsters, Inc.While this journey from the mailroom to success supports the ""work hard and you can accomplish anything"" mentality of our generations, it also addresses the fact that Mike isn't ultimately meeting his initial goal. He acknowledges his failure and grows past that. No other examples come to mind of children movies in which a character or character fail and are okay with it, at least not in the end. This is what the critics missed. Pixar has chosen to tell a story about children (monsters) who grew up and realized that they cannot achieve their dreams, that their dreams are out of reach and totally unattainable. This bold lesson is actually a fantastic one for kids who watch this film.For some, it's been decades of being taught that it is okay to fail, but that with hard work you can still achieve those dreams. For many that's true, but for some it's just not feasible. MU has managed to tell a story that supports that second statement. Failing isn't bad and realizing that some dreams really are out of reach is also okay. The real lesson is to be comfortable with who you are, what you're truly capable of and utilizing your strengths to better yourself and your community. That's what Mike does, he becomes the coach and teacher. His knowledge of scaring helps Sullivan to eventual massive success. He helps the rest of Oozma Kappa reach their dreams.It's not a story about settling, it's a story about failing, learning from it and growing from the experience to make yourself and others better. It's a life lesson that we should share with this current and future generations. Yes you can reach your dreams with hard work, but if you can't, that's okay too.",5,Why the lessons in `Monsters University' are Pixar's most bold yet,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,7254,"['UPDATE',

Where MU differs from the rest of the pack is that it brings these elements all together in such a way the proves to he irresistibly charming and incredibly funny, I couldn't help but have a smile on my face throughout the entirety of the film.With Monsters University, I can finally say that the Pixar drought is over!MU tells a prequel story, one that didn't seem necessary at first glance. I was excited, but hesitantly so. Regardless of the reception, I knew that I was going to see it. After 2 years without a Pixar film (would not see cars 2 or brave), I couldn't stand it any longer. After all, Monsters Inc. is my favorite Pixar film! Afterwards, I was pleasantly surprised.First off, I need to say one thing: Monsters University is the funniest Pixar film to date. I was rolling in my seat with laughter at points, but unlike most Pixar humor it wasn't only the slapstick or the funny facial expressions that struck my funny bone, it was the way that Pixar nailed the college experience on the head. Fresh off the college train, it was equal parts amusing and wonderfully nostalgic to see Pixar's ""college movie"", which was pleasantly free of vulgar language or overt sexuality; it was simply a purely funny and charming world and story the whole way through.In some ways, MU had to have been the hardest film to make for Pixar. Since the genre relies so heavily on garbage humor, Pixar had to constantly think outside of the box to deliver both a funny and ingenious tale while avoiding everything that the genre has become known for in Hollywood, and Pixar brings its A game. Sure, a couple of jokes fall flat and are there purely for children's enjoyment, but just about every bit of humor is in here for people in college and beyond, and I applaud Monsters University for being so slyly mature and funny for an older audience.But it's just not the humor that rocks in MU, the story is true and heartfelt. Mike is going to school to learn how to become a scarer, where he meets a young, inexperienced, and egotistical Sully. It's an interesting dynamic that totally works, one that I honestly didn't see coming. The characters are all well written and have great development, neither rushed or forced.It's also relieving to see tons of brand new characters and how they develop Mike and Sully's relationship, all of whom are charming and unique. The story is filled with great messages for moviegoers of all ages, too. I also really felt for Mike and his striving towards academic success; his story resonated so much with me. My theater was cheering at points, and at others the tension was thick in the air. That's only happened in a select few other films, but not once in an animated film, which proves one thing: I wasn't the only one in love with these characters on the big screen! After an interesting and amusing series of events, Mike and Sully are forced to work together in the Scare Games to prove that they are more than just a pretty face.The third act takes an interesting and creative turn, one that was equal parts surprising and conclusive. Even if MU lacks that freight train pacing and a ""Boo"" character to keep tensions high and the plot moving progressively forward, I think having that same dynamic would've made MU too safe and too similar. And that is what I found the most delightful about MU's story: it was original. It didn't rely on Monsters Inc. for cannon; the story totally works on its own, which is the most commendable quality of MU. Prequels usually fall into the same formula and rely on its brand to sell. MU can stand alone an apart from INC, or right alongside of it, and that's my biggest compliment for MU.And once again Pixar Has utilized their beautiful RENDERMAN technology to bring the world of MU to life, with gorgeous CGI and believable characters. Presented in Sony Digital 4K, MU pops off the screen. The music by Randy Newman is quite fantastic; drum lines permeate an otherwise typical score, giving the music a unique feeling. I did miss the unique swing/jazz styles of INC, but it was good to see that some of the tunes from the original worked their way, respectively complementing the action on screen, as a nice little nod to the adventures to come within Monsters Inc.So, am I a Monsters fan? You bet. And the premise of a prequel? I was hesitant. Not any longer.Charming, hysterically funny, and most of all well told, well written and relatable, Monsters University could've been the most disappointing cash in of the summer.

1562761,AHF97M45JFCB,B008JFUPOY,ONENEO,"[7, 14]","The summer of 2013 will likely be remembered as a period of sequels for the computer generated animated feature film segment.  Sure there are some original pieces sliding into the fray (Epic & Turbo for example) but the lion's share of the media attention falls squarely on Pixar's Monsters University, Universal Pictures'/ Illumination's Despicable Me 2 and already the trailers are beginning to circulate for Disney's third entry into the Cars universe: Planes as well as Sony's forthcoming Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 (I won't even start about a little underwater piece that's been announced called Finding Dory).Okay technically Monsters University is a prequel and not a sequel, the point of course is that we're entering a phase where the big studios aren't quite as concerned with developing new films from the ground up so much as revisiting their established franchises in the hopes of breathing new life into their appeal.I, like many, felt that 2001's Monsters Inc. wasn't in dire need of branching out in either direction of the fictional timeline but figured it would be kind of fun to journey back into the collegiate efforts of Monsters Incorporated's star scarers from the first time the early trailers went public depicting Sulley turning Mike into a makeshift dorm room disco ball (a scene that is, surprisingly, absent from the actual film).What is not absent however is 103-minutes of well-paced Pixar comedy comprising the studio's fourteenth feature film.  The plot, which even the most conservative of commercials or summaries reveals, follows the early exploits of the unlikely duo of James P Sullivan and Mike Wazowski before they were a pair of working class stiffs.The story begins with a brief prologue of the nerdy model elementary student Mike, who, during a field trip to Monsters Inc., decides that one day he'd like to become a famous scarer.His ambition and good grades deliver him to the hallowed halls of Monsters University (MU), touted as the best place to learn the art of scaring.  Fighting an uphill battle from the onset, the small green ball discovers he's got the brains but not the bod to send human children into hysterics.  Before long he meets an egotistical and lazy Sulley; in many ways his inherent opposite and the two begin what could better be described as a rivalry rather than a relationship.Once a mishap gets the pair ejected from the Scare Program, the duo realize the school's ""Scare Games"" present an opportunity to redeem their reputations and, thanks to a little slick talking by Mike, a shot at returning to their major of choice.  What results is an impromptu initiation into loser fraternity Oozma Kappa, a battle against insurmountable odds and a whole lot of humorously integrated value of teamwork.Reprising their voice roles more than a decade after the fact, Billy Crystal and John Goodman return with all of the charm and wit that carried the first film.  Even Steve Buscemi is back to play the sneaky Randy while newcomer Helen Mirren casts a dark shadow as the genuinely intimidating Dean Hardscrabble.The key to making the most out of Monsters University is to almost make yourself forget this is a big budget Pixar film.  If such thing were possible, the piece's biggest flaw stems from the fact that Pixar has been spoiling us for nearly 20-years with films that come dangerously close to the definition of perfection.In other words, these guys may actually have raised the bar so high that they themselves can't trump their earlier efforts.  Whether we're talking about the touching friendship established in the Toy Stories, the microcosm of society found within the world of Cars, robotic love discovered amidst endless piles of garbage in a human-less earth in Wall-E, or the simple love for the culinary arts fueling Ratatouille; you could count on Pixar to use the computer-generated medium to take you places  you'd never imagine and to do so with so much clever charm that you thought about the film for days, sometimes even years after watching it.To that end, Monsters University is a far cry from the glory days.  Make no mistake, the film commits no crimes and is enjoyable from start to finish but simply lacks that Pixar magic that has typically put the studio head and shoulders above the competition.Pacing is excellent, the visual charm is flawless and (as mentioned above) the vocal cast is as on point as ever.  However, kids aren't going to understand the nuances of college (or perhaps even more specifically, fraternity or sorority) life and a majority of the situational tension relies upon the ups and downs of life in an institute of higher learning.In conclusion, Monsters University is a prequel that plays it safe and delivers upon all of the spit and polish one would expect from a Disney/ Pixar collaboration but comes off as an unnecessary revisitation to one of their more clever concepts.  At the end of the day, you can go into this one with expectations of Pixar's standards and come away slightly underwhelmed or imagine it as an animated film from just about anyone else and enjoy it for what it is.",3,A Decent Prequel That Fails to Fill Its Monster Sized Shoes,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,5121,"['summer', '2013', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'remembered', 'period', 'sequels',

""Monsters University"" is the back-story of how Sully and Mike Wazowski became the best friends they were in ""Monsters Inc."" It all starts in college, from day one Mike has been a perfect student ever since he decided he wanted to be a top scarer when he grows up. That is his dream and he works hard to accomplish it. Sully, on the other hand thinks everything is going to be handed to him because he's a Sullivan and his father is the ultimate top scarer. Everything changes when both of them get kicked out of the scare program. This is when Mike and Sully must work together to prove they can be worthy of scaring. There's a surprise plot twist at the end that you'd have to watch to see what happens.I like the concept of ""Monsters University"" just as the original ""Monsters Inc."" touched the hearts of many in 2001.  However, no one really knew how they became best friends in the beginning. This is what makes the concept of this movie so interesting because of the fact that normally you would see the movie of how they met first and then see them continue their life in a sequel. I also like the animation in this movie. Every character has their own personality and special features as none of the monsters look exactly the same.  Some have tentacles, some have more than two eyes and some monsters are scarier than others, but everyone has something in common: they all want to be a scarer.All the characters are very amazing but my favorite character is Mike Wazowski. When Mike was little, everyone always made fun of him for being too small and no one thought he would accomplish anything in life. He works hard to get into Monsters University because he is determined to succeed and in the end, he may not get what he wants but he is still happy, and that's what is important.My favorite scene is when Mike and Sully are in the first round of the scare games and they have to race through a dark tunnel with spiky balls on the floor that make you blow up like a marshmallow. Both of them come out of the race with a puffy lip and swollen legs because they touched the spiky balls and they could barely talk. It made me laugh a lot.I recommend ""Monsters University"" for ages 6-14. It is an amazing family movie and kids will love it. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Jailene A., KIDS FIRST!

Zwick,"[0, 0]","****1/2Monsters University is where creatures go when they want to be instructed on the fine art of scaring the bejesus out of unsuspecting tykes lying all snug in their beds at night. Yet, while many aspire to such a career, few are called. And no one wants to learn to be a first-class scarer more than little Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a short, green, one-eyed, retainer-wearing, utterly nondescript blob-with-limbs who frankly couldn't scare a bed sheet on Halloween. And it doesn't help that his greatest competition in the school's annual scare-off is a hulking furry brute by the name of  Sulley (John Goodman) who comes from a long line of scarers. But in the great opposites-attract tradition, Mike and Sulley soon learn that they can achieve more by working together than working apart. This is particularly the case after they join a fraternity made up of other wanna-be scarers who are determined to win the contest against a half-a-dozen other teams of more reliably frightening monsters.""Monsters University"" may not be as emotionally resonant or cerebral as some previous PIXAR productions, but this prequel to the 2001 mega-hit ""Monsters, Inc.,"" is one of the most purely enjoyable films ever to come out of that studio - and that is saying a great deal indeed. It has terrific fun parodying the rituals of college life - fraternities, cliques, the high-pressured stress of exams - yet still manages to relate to the younger set's concerns with the need to be accepted by the ""in"" crowd while at the same time finding the inner strength to remain an individual and to stand up for oneself and all the other misfits in society (think of this as a monster-sized riff on ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer"").As this is a PIXAR release, it's practically superfluous to praise the wit and ingenuity of the script (by Daniel Gerson, Robert L. Baird and director Dan Scanlon), the beauty of the animation with its gorgeous collegiate-gothic backgrounds, and the spot-on voiceover work that have long been the hallmarks of that studio's output. The all-star cast includes, in addition to Crystal and Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Sean Hayes, Helen Mirren, Aubrey Plaza, John Kraskinski, Bonnie Hunt, Bill Hader, and a whole lot more.So sit back, relax and enjoy the delicious treat that is ""Monsters University.""

Another home-run sequel in the tradition of Toy Story 2 and 3 (but not so much Cars 2), Monsters University is a wonderful film that expands upon and enhances the Monsters universe with enough narrative and heart to justify its own film.As expected, there are gags galore as we see protagonist Mike Wazowski, stepping into the spotlight from his more ""buddy"" role in the original Monsters, Inc., arrive at his first day of college, move into the dorms, and experience Greek Life. There are plenty of monsters and nostalgia-inducing college sights to see throughout Mike's journey.We see familiar faces, like Randall the villain monster from the original, who is now just a classmate and colleague of the main monsters. We even revisit the Monsters, Inc. workplace a couple times. But what's so fantastic about this sequel is that it doesn't handicap itself by relying so much on familiarity; the story and message driving this work is compelling enough to hold its own, which is hard enough for any companion film let alone a prequel.One of the movie's best moments comes when the brothers of Oozma Kappa, the ragtag fraternity of misfit monsters, peeks inside the Monsters, Inc. headquarters. They themselves an outcasted bunch of individuals, they admire how at Monsters, Inc., none of the scarers have anything in common - anybody could grow up to be a scarer, not just bigger, stronger, scarier monsters.While this movie has its share of sentimentality, it's not the emotional juggernaut of other Pixar efforts, and it doesn't need to be. This is a film about the future, and how anybody can achieve their dreams through hard work and determination. It's not a regretful, remorseful look at the past such as Brave and Toy Story 3; it's about how to move forward and build yourself into who you want to be.*SPOILER: I also love the very ending of this film, with Mike and Sulley being forced out of school and working their way up from the bottom at the Monsters, Inc. mailroom. This was a surprising and refreshing end, to show these two young men at a potential dead end, but who just keep plowing ahead to their goal of becoming top scarers, and doing what they need to to reach that level. This is the kind of story that is realistic yet inspirational, and considerably more powerful than if they had graduated as top students and immediately got top-level positions at Monsters, Inc. I am really proud of Pixar for going with this less glamorous yet more realistic and admirable plot point. *END SPOILERMonsters University is the rare sequel with characters we know so well, and who still manage to surprise us and even move us.

1562846,A26MJME9IBNETY,B008JFUPOY,StrangePegs,"[4, 8]","I loved Monsters, Inc.; it's still one of my favorite Pixar movies. It's a touching movie about friendship and the lengths one monster goes to for a friendship even when he doesn't necessarily agree with his friend. And the relationship between Sully and Boo brought a tear to my eye in his willingness to let go of something that he loves to do what is best for that something. That something being Boo. However, it's the challenging of the norms that make the film standout. It's the demonstration that we ought to be constantly questioning the status quo and tradition so that we know whether there are better ways, now, than there were when those traditions were established that make the film really shine. [And I would bet money on it being a subtle jab at Disney, whom Pixar had fight every step of the way to get Toy Story out in the form we saw it in, because Disney wanted a more traditional story.]But there is none of that in Monsters University. It is, in every way possible, a standard Disney film. Well, okay, maybe it's not standard Disney, but it's certainly standard. Two guys, rivals, have to learn to work together to overcome some great obstacle and, in so doing, they learn they are great partners. And, because of that, friends. It's the plot of virtually every buddy cop movie out there. Except Monsters U is in a school setting. There is nothing in the movie that is beyond typical.Which is not to say that it's not enjoyable, because it is. Very enjoyable. It just doesn't feel like Pixar; it feels like Disney. Safe. Traditional. And that's disappointing. Because what we learned from Pixar is that traditional, for them, was challenging tradition. But that was before Disney. Don't get me wrong, Disney can make great films, but they are hardly ever challenging.All of that said, Monsters U was enjoyable. It was fun to get to see Sully and Mike again and, even, Randall. Dean Hardscrabble was a great, new character, completely freaky, and Helen Mirren was excellent in the role. I wouldn't have wanted her paying any kind of personal attention to me. No, not even to tell me good job, because even ""good job"" from her would seem to carry some kind of menace.Visually, the movie made no improvements over its predecessor. In fact, the animation seemed flatter. More plastic. But, then, it has been a while since I watched Monsters, Inc. so there may be some amount of idealization going on in my head as far as that goes. Still, after more than 10 years, you'd expect some amount of improvement, especially after the richness of the animation in Brave.Many people say that it's unfair to judge Pixar movies by their previous endeavors, but I don't really agree. That's kind of like saying you shouldn't judge a McDonald's cheeseburger by other McDonald's cheeseburgers. Pixar did, after all, establish what a Pixar movie should be like. They are also the ones that have allowed Disney to mess with their recipe, which it's hard to fault Disney for since they own Pixar, now. However, these new Pixar burgers don't taste quite the same, quite as good, as the old ones. So, it may be true that Monsters University is a fine a movie, which it is, but it's not a fine Pixar movie.

The fans wanted to see more of Boo, Mike, and Sully back in action for more adventures.

We see how Mike and Sullivan meet and how they became friends (right after a small feud between the two of 'em).  But that's not all!  We even see how Randal started and I think you might be surprised (spoilers).

The misfits are challenged to win the Scare Games with the prize being admission to the Scare Program or expulsion from the University if they don't.  Sully, who hasn't studied the entire semester finds himself kicked out of his fraternity and moving in with the nerds in an effort to regain his status, but he gains something better instead...friend Mike.

1562886,A4YXKE5F62II8,B008JFUPOY,Visual Bureau,"[2, 4]","""After what many people consider the great disappointments in Pixar's career, Cars 2 and Brave, the legendary animation team up-the-ante a little to bring back a beloved film, Monsters Inc., with its prequel Monsters University. In regard to how well the film does, it goes beyond expectations (as I did not read the synopsis or information about it) only to offer a very funny, unique, and occasionally tense film about what it means to show how scary and strong you are.The film has, in some way, a more human quality to this than I could imagine where Mike and Sully show their frustration, happiness, and excitement all around their first semester at MU and given the university setting, the film gives a very old-school and quirky vibe poking fun at fraternities, admissions, laboratories, study habits, parties, and casual cliches from films like Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds (but more family-friendly). The voice work and imagination, while not as dynamic as it could have been or its predecessor, amps up on providing some relatable and funny to many people within the 18-24 year old gap with smart jokes and satire and the children very strong animation, background design, and colour schemes with zany situations involving Mike and Sully's fraternity. Helen Mirren provides an intriguing voiceover as the menacing and straight-forward observer of the Scaring Programme. Her presence, even if a monster, makes you feel that you should not mess with an experienced person like herself.The film might trouble some parents as the film does not end in an expected way or promote the strongest morals but it certainly heightens its awareness when Mike and Sully know their actions and fallouts are a result of them being two polar opposites learning and driven to ""scare."" For British and international audiences though, the humour maybe too specific and culturally irrelevant due to the Americanism/possible Canadianism of the jokes about fraternities, cheerleaders, and college football (or US rugby) will not be well-understood.But then again, the positives here outweigh the potential negatives. MU is certainly a feast for the eyes and it does not disappoint, bore, or make you exhausted. Out of all the Pixar films, MU might be ranked just below The Incredibles and Ratatouille and ranked above Toy Story 3 (no offense to any fans) and Finding Nemo which serves very good justice. Even with a Rotten Tomatoes 78%, the underdog still wins the round here and so does Brave to a certain extent.As a tradition of all Pixar films, there is a short film. The Blue Umbrella is their newest short film and it premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2013. In short, the film is a simple and coincidental love story that focuses on a blue umbrella gazing at a red one and finding it. The animation is beyond superb as it executes an element of perfection and believability in the way it looks. If it is live-action or performance capture, then they have certainly done a good job at enhancing the realism here. It also feels a lot more experimental and possibly hipster than the other Pixar shorts as given by the score and the glitchy editing when something changes drastically in a scene. Nevertheless, it is certainly a well-dserved treat and shows how capable Pixar are at this craft much like their short films Geri's Game and Luxo, Jr.""",5,Wasn't what I expected?

1562889,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B008JFUPOY,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[10, 16]","Monsters University, the sequel/prequel to 2001's highly popular Monsters, Inc., is entertaining and fast-paced enough to keep you from being bored. The problem is that you won't be surprised either. It's probably a film more to be enjoyed by kids who haven't seen all of the movies that MU draws - heavily - on and who aren't familiar with the well-used formulas that seem to make up most of what passes for plot. Don't get me wrong. MU isn't bad by any means. It does entertain and it does provide some interesting background for the characters - mainly ""Sully"" Sullivan and Mike Wazowski, but also their nemesis-to-be, Randy Boggs - that we remember from Monsters, Inc., and introduces some new characters as well. The only problem is that we've seen it all before and so nothing really surprises.The plot of MU is how Mike and Sully (voiced perfectly once again by the inimitable Billy Crystal and John Goodman) first came to meet before they went to work for Monsters, Inc. The film begins with a very young Mike going on a school field trip to Monsters, Inc. Wanting to see everything - which is hard when you're the shortest guy in the class - Mike ends up getting an unexpected experience of seeing close up what it's like to be a Scarer. And is immediately hooked, knowing what he wants to do in life. And where he has to go in order to learn how to do it: Monsters University.Things flash-forward a few years when Mike first sets foot in the hallowed halls of MU, where he meets - and quickly becomes rivals with - James ""Sully"" Sullivan, already something of a celebrity as he comes from a long line of famous scarers. They are the classic odd couple. Mike is manic, nerdy and a control-freak, while Sully is the MU equivalent of a legacy/jock: laid-back, over-confident and content to coast on his reputation. How they go from being bitter rivals who can't stand each other to being an inseparable team is the rest of the movie.It all flows well enough, but time and again I found myself realizing that I'd seen it all before, many times. Mike's life-forming childhood experience was drawn from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The fraternity parts were drawn from Revenge of the Nerds. Sully and Mike's odd-couple bickering-to-bonding plot was a well-worn formula from any number of buddy movies. Even the best new character, the highly intimidating Dean Hardscrabble (imperiously voiced by the equally inimitable Helen Mirren), was strongly derivative, down to the expression and even body language, of the Grand Councilwoman from Lilo & Stitch. About the most original thing in MU was how Randy (voiced once again by Steve Buscemi) was taken from actually being a meek bespectacled nice-guy anxious to make friends and turned into the vicious underhanded nemesis Mike and Sully had to contend with in Monsters, Inc.Part of the reason why Monsters University fails to reach the level of Monsters, Inc. is almost certainly due to the differences in the creative forces behind them. MI was directed by Pete Docter (who also directed the marvelous Up and the funny short Mike's New Car and wrote not only MI but also Toy Story, Toy Story 2, WALL-E and Up).

1562892,A3SO4SZPDNW0S3,B008JFUPOY,William Krischke,"[6, 13]","Monsters University is an enjoyable film, a riff on the college comedy, borrowing liberally from ""Revenge of the Nerds.""  But the more I think about it, the more problems I detect with its execution.  Which is maybe further proof that it's better just to watch movies (especially summer-release movies) and not think about them.To begin with, what age group is this made for?  Tonally, it's definitely pitched at kids - it lacks the kind of deeper resonance that has made Pixar films favorites among adults for the last decade.  And I'm okay with that, these days I'm feeling like we need to let Pixar off the hook a little, and let them just make decent kids' movies.  But does ""Monsters U"" work as a kid's movie? The premise of ""Monsters, Inc."" felt a little difficult for children to grasp, and it's even more so here.  You need to understand that in the monster world, children's screams are a valuable source of energy, and the monsters evoking those screams are just doing their job.  But what does a first grader understand about energy production and usage? Do they really get that the TV and dishwasher and nightlight all work because of the coal plant?  I doubt it.  The first movie hedged this bet effectively, both by explaining it to death, and by forging a paternal bond between Sully and Boo.  When watching ""Monsters, Inc.,"" a five year old doesn't need to understand the dynamics of energy production in the monster world to understand who the good guys are; they see Sully cuddling Boo, and they get it.  But in ""Monsters University,""  there's no Boo.  There's no explanation either.  The children are scarce, and when they appear, are a source of energy, and nothing else.  How does that play for a five-year-old, especially one who hasn't seen the first movie?Serving as a prequel to ""Monsters, Inc,"" we get to know one-eyed, walking ping-pong ball Mike Wazowsky and intimidating-except-for-the-purple-polka-dots Jimmy Sullivan (Sully) as polar opposite students.  Mike is all book knowledge and technique; he can ace a pop quiz and demonstrate zombie drooling with profiency, but can't spook a tabby cat to save his life. Sully comes from a family of prestigious scarers, and skates on his reputation; he's got a mighty roar and intimidating physique, but not much else.The two are rivals until they get kicked out of scare school (for the dumbest of reasons) and must find a way to prove to the dean (Helen Mirren, onscreen as a creepy cross between a dragon and a centipede) that they have what it takes to be truly scary.  The path to victory has them enlisting a fraternity of lovable losers and competing in the scare games, which bear more than a slight resemblance to the Triwizard Tournament in Harry Potter.Surprisingly, ""Monsters University"" never deals with its biggest plot point: Mike loves scaring but just isn't scary.  Where does he fit?  Everyone around him says ""nowhere,"" including the dean of the school, who relegates him to classes on can manufacturing.  Anyone who's seen (and remembers) the first film knows that Mike never manages to become scary. In ""Monsters, Inc.,"" He's basically Sulley's handler, but in the timeline of ""Monsters U,"" that job doesn't exist. (Until the montage at the very end, when suddenly it does.)What changed? Since Pixar movies generally try to play by the same rules as the real world, you would assume that the change didn't happen easily.  No corporation is going to employ two people to do the same job they used to get done with just one person. Mike and Sully would have had to fight hard, and demonstrate compellingly, that the handler position was necessary.  There would have to be some kind of sea change in the scaring industry.  This is a movie I'd like to see; it'd be a creative take on the ""workplace crusader"" genre.  Granted, it would be hard to make it kid-friendly, but Pixar has never before shied away from a challenge (for heaven's sake, ""Wall-E"" was about a lone robot stranded on a garbage suffocated planet, but they made THAT kid-friendly) but that's not the movie that got made.But I'll confess, willingly, that this is just me grousing, because that's what I do - I think, and I grouse. There's a lot to like about ""Monsters University,"" but none of it is all that interesting to write about.  The animation is beautiful, as it always is.  There's a lot of fun attention to detail on the college campus.  The voice work is very good, and I'll give a special shout-out to Helen Mirren, who makes Dean Hardscrabble quietly scary.  The supporting characters are fun variations on old stereotypes. It's well-paced, and never feels like it's trying too hard.  And so forth.A lot of ink (or... pixels?  what-have-you) about the decline of Pixar, and ""Monsters University"" does nothing to reverse that trend. It's about on-par with ""Brave,"" (not the adherence to formula in both) better than ""Cars 2,"" and not even approaching the four films before that.  I'd say that at this point, Pixar has settled in to making perfectly adequate kids' entertainment, similar in quality and style to DreamWorks.  They're not annoying, and they're better crafted than most. They're not the uncontested champs in the animation world anymore, but they're still top tier.

Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) also plays a role (a ""returning"" character from ""Inc.""), while a group of geeky monster freshmen discover what working together and for a better future is all about.Simply put, ""Monsters U"" is a very solid effort in the animation category.  To be sure, it is not in the upper-echelon (Toy Story, Nemo, Tangled, Wall-E), but it is purely entertaining.
