Gary Sinese continues to lead a close-knit cast as tough former Marine and current NYPD Detective Mac Taylor. ""CSI: NY"", a spin-off of the original ""CSI"" and ""CSI: Miami"", offers weekly drama built around the solving of some of the unique crimes possible in the rich ethnic and cultural mix of New York City.An addition to the cast this season is Sela Ward as Mac's new second in command, Detective Jo Danville, a transfer from Washington DC who arrives with Southern grace, good detective skills, and a proprietary interest in Mac Taylor.  Danville's ex-husband, an FBI agent played by David James Elliot, figures in several storylines, as do her two children.One of the highlights of this season is a three episode arc at the end, which reunits Mac Taylor with his first mentor on the police force, now retired (and well played by a grizzled Peter Fonda).  A case from early in Mac's career comes back to haunt him, for reasons that only his former mentor can explain, if they can live long enough to have the discussion.  The season finale has Mac questioning his tenure with the NYPD after facing death at close range perhaps once too often.  Mac will tackle his last unsolved case, not knowing whether it will be his last as an NYPD detective.""CSI: NY - The Seventh Season"" is highly recommended to its fans.
