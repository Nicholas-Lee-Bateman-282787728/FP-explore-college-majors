1531022,A2PFO3JKA40FUC,B007I1Q4MM,Ashley Barrett,"[0, 0]",We've only watched 2 of the episodes so far but I grew up watching this series and loved every minute of it-it's the reason why I was so interested in science as a kid.  I purchased this set on recommendation of a friend.  We homeschool and science is EXTREMELY important to us-one of the reasons we homeschool is because we don't feel public schools really get kids interested in science and because my husband is a scientist he can see more of the ins and outs and how important it is to encourage kids to learn about science (if you're good at it you can really earn some good money too!).  This is well put together and I'm glad it has all of them.  My 4 1/2 year old (who is very smart and advanced for his age-I say this not to brag but possibly most 4 1/2 year olds wouldn't be so engrossed by this or understand it quite as well?) and 2 year old sat watching two episodes as we ate lunch today and both are just begging for more.  We are using Apologia science specifically the one about Human Anatomy and Physiology right now so I'm using it to compliment what I'm teaching him with the hands-on approach Apologia uses.  I believe in helping kids use as many of their senses as possible to learn their subjects so this is really helping explain information in a different way.My ONLY con of this is they don't seem to be in order of when they were released nor do they have any of that information if you wanted to watch all of them in order.  As the stories don't build upon each other some may not think this is a big deal but I think it would be nice to know-it doesn't lose a star over this but something to note.  Also the quality of the picture could probably be cleaned up a little but since it's a hand drawn cartoon (at least I'm pretty sure on that since it's over 25 years old) that may not be possible.  The sound quality and everything was fine.I recommend this to all parents-whether you homeschool or not-to help your kids learn science and get interested in it.  Watch it with them!  Ask questions!  Sure it may be cheesy to the parents but there's great information in there that you can also use to help you remember these science topics.,5,An Oldie but a Goodie!,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,2165,"[""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', '2', 'episodes', 'so', 'far', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'series', 'loved', 'minute', 'it-it', 'reason', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'interested', 'science', 'kid', 'purchased', 'set', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'homeschool', 'science', 'EXTREMELY', 'important', 'us-one', 'reasons', 'homeschool', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'public', 'schools', 'really', 'get', 'kids', 'interested', 'science', 'husband', 'scientist', 'can', 'see', 'more', 'ins', 'outs', 'how', 'important', 'encourage', 'kids', 'learn', 'science', ""'re"", 'good', 'can', 'really', 'earn', 'good', 'money', 'too', 'well', 'put', 'together', ""'m"", 'glad', '4', '1/2', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'very', 'smart', 'advanced', 'age-I', 'say', 'not', 'brag', 'possibly', 'most', '4', '1/2', 'year', 'olds', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'engrossed', 'understand', 'quite', 'as', 'well', '2', 'year', 'old', 'sat', 'watching', 'two', 'episodes', 'ate', 'lunch', 'today', 'are', 'just', 'begging', 'more', 'are', 'using', 'Apologia', 'science', 'specifically', 'one', 'Human', 'Anatomy', 'Physiology', 'right', 'now', 'so', ""'m"", 'using', 'compliment', 'what', ""'m"", 'teaching', 'hands-on', 'approach', 'Apologia', 'believe', 'helping', 'kids', 'use', 'many', 'senses', 'possible', 'learn', 'subjects', 'really', 'helping', 'explain', 'information', 'different', 'way.My', 'ONLY', 'con', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'order', 'when', 'were', 'released', 'do', 'have', 'information', 'wanted', 'watch', 'order', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'build', 'other', 'may', 'not', 'think', 'big', 'deal', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'know-it', ""n't"", 'lose', 'star', 'something', 'note', 'Also', 'quality', 'picture', 'could', 'probably', 'be', 'cleaned', 'up', 'little', 'hand', 'drawn', 'cartoon', 'least', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', '25', 'years', 'old', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'possible', 'sound', 'quality', 'everything', 'was', 'fine.I', 'recommend', 'parents-whether', 'homeschool', 'not-to', 'help', 'kids', 'learn', 'science', 'get', 'interested', 'Watch', 'Ask', 'questions', 'Sure', 'may', 'be', 'cheesy', 'parents', 'great', 'information', 'can', 'also', 'use', 'help', 'remember', 'science', 'topics']",The Magic School Bus: The Complete Series

So honestly, watching the series today is a trip down memory lane -- and despite some scientific changes (such as computer advances or Pluto being exiled), ""Magic School Bus: The Complete Series"" still stands as a good, educational show for kids.The story series around Ms. Valerie Frizzle (Lily Tomlin), an eccentric elementary-school teacher who dresses according to the episode's theme. She has a sentient lizard named Liz, and a school bus that can transform into whatever the episode requires.She has a class of about eight students, who never seem to have math class or anything that requires them to actually stay in the building. Instead, Ms. Frizzle takes them on daily field trips, which the shape-shifting/time-traveling/shrinking bus allows them to do... in a very hands-on manner.So the class goes on adventures in the digestive system, the bloodstream, a pickle jar, space (multiple times), the desert, a rotting log, an anthill, the Cretaceous Period, the water cycle, the bus's engine, a toy plane, Herp Haven, a beehive, an old monster movie, the Arctic, a magic pinball machine, muscles, the rainforest, a chicken egg, the swamp, the interior of a nose, electrical currents, a computer, a coral reef and so on.And they learn about all sorts of things -- erosion, stars, cells, friction, ecosystems, microbes, recycling, tidepools, muscle oxygenation, reptiles, bats, light tricks, sound etc.  Nothing is hugely in-depth, but they give a pretty good start for kids.""Magic School Bus"" was made in the mid-1990s, but it's actually held up quite well. Except for a few things that have changed (Pluto and home computers), most of the science stuff in this series is still pretty valid. It conveys sometimes-complex scenarios (muscle oxygenation) in a simple, easy-to-understand manner.And they mix it up with plenty of comedy (Ms. Frizzle's entrances are always... unique) and some explicit demonstrations of just how these things work (a frictionless baseball game!). One warning for adults, though: lots of puns. LOTS of puns.Though the kids have the appearance of having been chosen so no ethnic group would feel left out, they're each given a pretty decent characterization. One is sensible and bookish, one is strong and impulsive, one is idealistic and always talking about her ""old school,"" one is overimaginative, one is a clown, et cetera.It's been around for almost two decades, but ""Magic School Bus: The Complete Series"" has actually aged pretty well, and is still a solid form of education/entertainment.",4,Wahoo!,1337472000,"05 20, 2012",2012,2616,"['Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'was', 'major', 'part', 'TV-watching', 'experience', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'So', 'honestly', 'watching', 'series', 'today', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'scientific', 'changes', 'such', 'computer', 'advances', 'Pluto', 'being', 'exiled', 'Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'Complete', 'Series', 'still', 'good', 'educational', 'show', 'kids.The', 'story', 'series', 'Ms.', 'Valerie', 'Frizzle', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'eccentric', 'elementary-school', 'teacher', 'who', 'according', 'episode', 'theme', 'sentient', 'lizard', 'named', 'Liz', 'school', 'bus', 'can', 'transform', 'episode', 'requires.She', 'class', 'about', 'eight', 'students', 'who', 'never', 'seem', 'have', 'math', 'class', 'anything', 'actually', 'stay', 'building', 'Instead', 'Ms.', 'Frizzle', 'daily', 'field', 'trips', 'shape-shifting/time-traveling/shrinking', 'bus', 'do', 'very', 'hands-on', 'manner.So', 'class', 'adventures', 'digestive', 'system', 'bloodstream', 'pickle', 'jar', 'space', 'multiple', 'times', 'desert', 'rotting', 'log', 'anthill', 'Cretaceous', 'Period', 'water', 'cycle', 'bus', 'engine', 'toy', 'plane', 'Herp', 'Haven', 'beehive', 'old', 'monster', 'movie', 'Arctic', 'magic', 'pinball', 'machine', 'muscles', 'rainforest', 'chicken', 'egg', 'swamp', 'interior', 'nose', 'electrical', 'currents', 'computer', 'coral', 'reef', 'so', 'on.And', 'learn', 'sorts', 'things', 'erosion', 'stars', 'cells', 'friction', 'microbes', 'recycling', 'tidepools', 'muscle', 'oxygenation', 'reptiles', 'bats', 'light', 'tricks', 'sound', 'etc', 'Nothing', 'hugely', 'in-depth', 'give', 'pretty', 'good', 'start', 'kids', 'Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'was', 'made', 'mid-1990s', 'actually', 'held', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'few', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'Pluto', 'home', 'computers', 'most', 'science', 'stuff', 'series', 'still', 'pretty', 'valid', 'conveys', 'sometimes-complex', 'scenarios', 'muscle', 'oxygenation', 'simple', 'easy-to-understand', 'manner.And', 'mix', 'up', 'plenty', 'comedy', 'Ms.', 'Frizzle', 'entrances', 'are', 'always', 'unique', 'explicit', 'demonstrations', 'just', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'frictionless', 'baseball', 'game', 'One', 'warning', 'adults', 'lots', 'puns', 'LOTS', 'kids', 'have', 'appearance', 'having', 'been', 'chosen', 'so', 'no', 'ethnic', 'group', 'would', 'feel', 'left', 'out', ""'re"", 'given', 'pretty', 'decent', 'characterization', 'One', 'sensible', 'bookish', 'one', 'strong', 'impulsive', 'one', 'idealistic', 'always', 'talking', 'old', 'school', 'one', 'overimaginative', 'one', 'clown', 'et', 'cetera.It', 'been', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'Complete', 'Series', 'actually', 'aged', 'pretty', 'well', 'still', 'solid', 'form', 'education/entertainment']",The Magic School Bus: The Complete Series

1531047,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007I1Q4MM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[216, 218]","For four fact filled seasons from 1994 to 1998, ""The Magic School Bus"" paved the way for kids to believe that science was cool.  As the television landscape continues to devolve, it's refreshing to see the Bus resurface in this Complete Series collection.  Charming and educational, this animated delight is comprised of 52 thirty minute episodes.  Ms. Frizzle (voiced by the distinctive and invaluable Lily Tomlin) takes her class of enthusiastic students on trips filled with fantasy and wonder.  Astronomy, biology, geology, physics, chemistry, paleontology, and just about every other ""ology"" gets a visit or two through the course of the various field trips.  However, if you're shopping ""The Magic School Bus: The Complete Series,"" you probably want to know what is included with your investment.Packaging:  The box set looks great.  The cover is done in a 3-D lenticular design that already ups the cool quotient.  Each of the eight DVDs is enclosed in its own case within the set with complete episode information for easy access.  Each individual season has thirteen episodes over two of the DVDs.Content: 52 episodes at approximately 22 hours of complete running time.  Recommended ages 4-10.  English or Spanish language options.Bonus Material:  A 24 page kids activity guide is a nice addition (though not the most sophisticated presentation I've ever seen).  More valuable is the Parents' Guide.  This tool helps you orchestrate lessons with your kids and makes this an invaluable teaching tool.  I, personally, love that ""The Magic School Bus"" advocates parent involvement as opposed to being just another TV show to plant your kids in front of (although that's certainly an option too).Easily recommended, but perhaps cost prohibitive, there are smaller packaging choices available if you're on a budget.  The ones I'm listing are new sets to DVDs (although episodes will overlap if you have previously released compilations).  That is a potential pitfall to this buying strategy.  If you want to collect ""The Magic Bus,"" there are past DVD releases and new DVD releases and, if you're not diligent, it would be very easy to purchase some of the same episodes under different titles.  The Complete Series choice will eliminate this possible duplication and offers every epsiode (some never before on DVD).These two lower price compilation have an assortment of 12 episodes each:(1) Blast Off! From Sea To Space(2) Field Trip Fun and GamesOr even smaller, these four sets have about 90 minutes of content that bring episodes relating to a specific topic together:(1) The Human Body(2) Super Star Power(3) Takes a Dive (coral reefs, tidal zones, etc)(4) Takes Flight (weather, flying, etc.)I love and respect ""The Magic School Bus.""
