727545,A1DGAYHCDXE7FU,B00007ELF9,AH-1Z,"[5, 6]","This is a movie that potentially could be really entertaining, but just doesn't work.  It's not awful, it is cute, there are a few genuinely funny moments and you won't waste your time watching it, but that's about it.  There are a number of reasons for this.The first is the writing.  Besides the skimpy plot, there are some really implausible things going on here, the actors aren't presented with that much to work with, and sometimes it's so jarring that you simply fall out of the suspension of disbelief that you have to have to enjoy any film.  A few examples:  Matthew Perry wants to buy and run a winery in the Napa Valley. He pursues the opportunity to get a million dollars to accomplish this.  A million dollars isn't even remotely enough money to start, let alone run one up there, and he's too dumb to know this.  Remember, he couldn't have possibly anticipated how he would get more money at the end.  He has no plan to actually get to his winery.  Another example is having Elizabeth Hurley prance around in a T-shirt labled ""Trailer Trash"".  There's no purpose to that, I guess it's supposed to be ""funny"".Probably the biggest of many plot stupidities is when, because of an improbable lucky break, Perry's character has the opportunity to undo the damage he caused and easily salvage the whole thing if he reacts quickly.  What's the first thing he does?  Go out and do it before anything can go wrong?  No, he phones the ""other side"" and brags about their mistake and what he's going to do!  This is insane!The direction is seviceable, but in many cases it looks like the actors were on their own, lacking a unified vision of what the film was suposed to be.As far as the cast goes, Matthew Perry is a drag on the picture.  That Elizabeth Hurley falls for him (Wow! what an unexpected development!) is totally unbelievable and illogical.  Grateful, yes, but love?  Part of this can be blamed on the awful writing.  It doesn't help that his character is an unlikable idiot, but part of it is just him. We've seen this problem in other pictures.  He has little chemistry with anyone else in the picture.  He was good in the small enclosed environment of Friends, but doesn't seem to be able to be that memorable at anything else (ala Kelsey Grammer sans Fraiser).  His timing is simply not that good.  His chemistry with Elizabeth Hurley is zero.Elizabeth Hurley:  OK, she's still gorgeous.  She still shows that deft sense of comedy timing that has appeared in other films. She suffers from lack of direction and from her costar's flatness.  She essentially carries the relationship, even though Perry's character is more frantic.  Sadly, she is essentially wasted in this picture.  She gives as good a performance as can be expected given what she has to work with.Bruce Campbell.  Always a hoot, I wish he got more work.  He plays the self-centered rich husband to perfection.  There is a problem, though, here with casting.  The setup is that he's dumping Elizabeth Hurley for a trophy wife.  When you see the actress that is playing his ""trophy-elect"", you have a major disconnect.  A guy with this ego, has a wife who looks like Elizabeth Hurley, who is clearly devoted to him, is going to dump her for the mistress as played here?  Nothing against said actress.  An egotist like Campbell's character might have an affair with her just because he's who he is, but he already has the ""trophy"".  It doesn't play.Cedric the Entertainer.  Simply put, he steals the move.  You smile whenever he's on.  His character has got a personality in this movie, something the other principals lack due to writing and possibly direction.  He probably just played the character the way he wanted and they just filmed.  Heck!  The  movie would have been more believable (and fun) if he and Perry had swirched roles (Hurley could also have played off him much better).To sum up, this is a diverting piece of fluff.  It's not as awful as some reviewers and critics have said, but it is essentially a pleasant time-filler.",3,"Not as bad as you'e heard, but not as good as you'd hope.",1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,4025,"['movie', 'potentially', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'entertaining', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'not', 'awful', 'cute', 'are', 'few', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'watching', 'are', 'number', 'reasons', 'this.The', 'first', 'writing', 'skimpy', 'plot', 'are', 'really', 'implausible', 'things', 'going', 'here', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'presented', 'much', 'work', 'so', 'jarring', 'simply', 'fall', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'have', 'have', 'enjoy', 'film', 'few', 'examples', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'buy', 'run', 'winery', 'Napa', 'Valley', 'opportunity', 'get', 'million', 'dollars', 'accomplish', 'million', 'dollars', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'enough', 'money', 'start', 'let', 'alone', 'run', 'one', 'up', 'there', 'too', 'dumb', 'know', 'Remember', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'possibly', 'anticipated', 'how', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'money', 'end', 'plan', 'actually', 'get', 'winery', 'example', 'having', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'prance', 'around', 'T-shirt', 'labled', 'Trailer', 'Trash', 'purpose', 'guess', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', '.Probably', 'biggest', 'many', 'plot', 'stupidities', 'when', 'improbable', 'lucky', 'break', 'Perry', 'character', 'opportunity', 'undo', 'damage', 'caused', 'easily', 'salvage', 'whole', 'thing', 'quickly', 'What', 'first', 'thing', 'Go', 'out', 'do', 'anything', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'No', 'other', 'side', 'brags', 'mistake', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'insane', 'direction', 'seviceable', 'many', 'cases', 'actors', 'were', 'own', 'lacking', 'unified', 'vision', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'suposed', 'be.As', 'far', 'cast', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'drag', 'picture', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'falls', 'Wow', 'what', 'unexpected', 'development', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'illogical', 'Grateful', 'yes', 'love', 'Part', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'awful', 'writing', ""n't"", 'help', 'character', 'unlikable', 'idiot', 'part', 'just', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'problem', 'other', 'pictures', 'little', 'chemistry', 'anyone', 'else', 'picture', 'was', 'good', 'small', 'enclosed', 'environment', 'Friends', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'memorable', 'anything', 'else', 'ala', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'sans', 'Fraiser', 'timing', 'simply', 'not', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'zero.Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'OK', 'still', 'gorgeous', 'still', 'deft', 'sense', 'comedy', 'timing', 'appeared', 'other', 'films', 'lack', 'direction', 'costar', 'flatness', 'essentially', 'relationship', 'even', 'Perry', 'character', 'more', 'frantic', 'Sadly', 'essentially', 'wasted', 'picture', 'as', 'good', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'given', 'what', 'work', 'with.Bruce', 'Campbell', 'hoot', 'wish', 'got', 'more', 'work', 'self-centered', 'rich', 'husband', 'perfection', 'problem', 'though', 'here', 'casting', 'setup', 'dumping', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'trophy', 'wife', 'When', 'see', 'actress', 'playing', 'trophy-elect', 'have', 'major', 'disconnect', 'guy', 'ego', 'wife', 'who', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'who', 'clearly', 'devoted', 'going', 'dump', 'mistress', 'played', 'here', 'Nothing', 'said', 'actress', 'egotist', 'Campbell', 'character', 'might', 'have', 'affair', 'just', 'who', 'already', 'trophy', ""n't"", 'play.Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Simply', 'put', 'move', 'smile', 'whenever', 'character', 'got', 'personality', 'movie', 'something', 'other', 'principals', 'lack', 'due', 'writing', 'possibly', 'direction', 'probably', 'just', 'played', 'character', 'way', 'wanted', 'just', 'filmed', 'Heck', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'fun', 'Perry', 'had', 'swirched', 'roles', 'Hurley', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'played', 'off', 'much', 'better', '.To', 'sum', 'up', 'diverting', 'piece', 'fluff', 'not', 'as', 'awful', 'reviewers', 'critics', 'have', 'said', 'essentially', 'pleasant', 'time-filler']",N/A
727546,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00007ELF9,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Matthew Perry is funny and Elizabeth Hurley is smoking hot, so you would assume that the two of them together would create some memorable sparks; but alas, this is yet another `stinker' helmed by Perry.  I don't understand why Matthew Perry fizzles on the big screen when he is so undeniable infectious on the small one.  Granted, I have enjoyed a few of his films (most notably `The Whole Nine Yards') but he only really delivers when his supporting cast is strong.  Here, the combination of poor plotting (some films pride themselves in making absolutely no sense) and zero chemistry (Hurley and Perry both seem so uncomfortable) create a lackluster outing that is beyond redemption.  It isn't funny, it isn't charming and even Hurley's never-ending legs cannot save this film from disaster.  It's funny, because when I dish out a 1-star rating to a film I usually can spit vile towards it, which at least shows that it registered with me for something.  `Serving Sarah' is so lifeless that I don't have anything to say.

Those people are wrong and they need to stop comparing his movie characters to his most famous role as Chandler on &quot;Friends.&quot; It's not a fair comparison and they won't enjoy his movies until they stop.Serving Sara has a funny plot. Joe Tyler(Perry) is a process server. He's pretty good at his job, but has been on the slump as of late. His boss Ray(Cedric) is mad at him and is ready to dump him for Tony(Pastore) if he doesn't stop screwing up. His next assignmrnt is big and simple.He must serve Sara Moore(Hurley) because her husband Gordon(Campbell) doesn't want to be married to her and he certainly doesn't want to give her any money. Sara is tipped though of Joe's plans and it doesn't work. She gives him a proposition though. If he can serve Gordon, she will give him half of the assests that she gets out of the divorce. Joe sees his chance for millions and decides to take it. Now the race is on in Texas to see if Joe can do it, before Tony catches up and tries to serve Sara.Matthew Perry is great in this movie. There isn't a better guy in Hollywood that uses sarcasm as well as he does. His timing is perfect in the movie and he takes the character Joe and runs with it. He's serious during the serious parts and he's funny as anything during the funny parts. I love Perry when he's working with the bull on the farm.Elizabeth Hurley is great as well. She plays her charcter Sara well. It is kind of a miscast for her, but she still works. She is as hot as ever in the movie, and is really there just for eye candy.Bruce Campbell is awesome. This guy is the man and so few people have ever heard of him. This isn't as funny as his role as Ash in the evil dead series, but it's certainly a change for him. He's funny doing the typical Texas stero tpye baron. His fans should be pleased with his performance.The rest of the cast is great as well. You have to like Cedric the Entertainer.

As for the jokes, there are plenty of those to go around as well.  Matthew Perry plays a process server assigned to hunt down and serve a wealthy socialite, played by Elizabeth Hurley, whose husband wants a divorce that won't harm him financially.  Angered, Hurley later happens to find Perry (a pretty amazing coincidence in itself) and convinces him to tear up her papers and help her serve her husband, putting her on top in the subsequent divorce proceedings.  Perry agrees and the two head from New York to Texas to find Hurley's husband, played by Bruce Campbell, all while being chased down by Perry's colleague, played by Vincent Pastore, who's been assigned to serve Hurley properly.  Again, this was a pretty funny movie, but that was basically all it was.  The characters weren't very deep, the plot was ripe with inaccuracies and amazing coincidences, and the conclusion was corny topped with one of the film's weaker jokes.  But most of the jokes were better than that as Perry and Hurley did remember to pack their funny.  It's good for some laughs on a Friday night.

When Gordon, a Texas millionaire, (Bruce Campbell) decides to serve his wife Sara (Elizabeth Hurley) divorce papers Joe sees his chance to finally get ahead. All he has to do is get to Sara before his co-worker can. This proves challenging for simple Joe. Finding her is one thing but actually catching her is another. When he does finally ambush her in one of her numerous homes she offers him a proposition. If he keeps her papers and helps her serve Gordon first she'll cut him in on her divorce settlement. The offer sounds tempting to Joe so off the duo go to Texas to nail Gordon.Countless chase scenes ensue that are too ridiculous to be funny.

727565,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00007ELF9,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 2]","It is strange but true. For the reasons Heaven only knows, someone at one Japanese distributing company decided to theatrically release `Serving Sara' in Japan on 26th November, 2005, the same day as the fourth `Harry Potter' film. Not a very clever way of doing business, I thought, but anyway I went to see it, not for Elizabeth Hurley or Matthew Perry, but for underrated Bruce Campbell, best known as `Ash' in the Evil Dead trilogy. Well, he was good, and so is Cedric the Entertainer, but the film itself was a dull comedy from the beginning to the end.The hero of the film is played by Matthew Perry, whose character Joe Tyler as process server is a fairly interesting one. Hired by shifty Ray (Cedric the Entertainer) Joe risks his life delivering process, and his job is a unique choice for a comedy. And let's give him a due credit (even though I didn't like `Friends' very much) for Perry is always amusing to see when doing a character in ridiculous situation like `The Whole Nine Yards.' Yes, the sequel was terrible, I know, but the first one was surprisingly funny.Now enters Elizabeth Hurley as Sara, on whom Joe serves a process as usual. It says that her philandering husband Gordon (Bruce Campbell) wants a divorce, which quite upsets Sara, who in turn offers a lucrative job to Joe - forget his process, and give HER notice to her husband instead, and get lots of money from her. Whether this is legal or not, I don't know, but as a set-up for a comedy, this is adequate.But something is wrong with the film. Slow storytelling and lazy gags are part of the reasons, but the most damaging is the lack of chemistry between Hurley and Perry. In one scene, Joe and Sara decide to share a motel room for one night, and the situation should be a chance to establish the romantic feeling between them. Instead, their relations remain the same with no emotional change seen between them. Even when they kiss each other, the scene looks still emotionally cold and detached.Perhaps the actors, whose lack of efforts to be in character, are to be blamed. Or perhaps the stereotyped descriptions of Texas are to be faulted. But probably, I think, it is director's fault Reginald Hudlin (whose previous film was awful `The Ladies Man') who is content with the generic and silly slapstick gags occasionally shown here and there (like Hurley's pants ripped, Perry drinking bad wine and spitting out, etc.) and none of them is really funny. There is one horrible (and extended) gross-out gag scene, one more addition to the tradition of `Let's-humiliate-cows-and-laugh' sequences, in which one of Perry's hands got stuck in the middle of an embarrassing place of the poor animal.But after all, these terrible moments could be improved (if not totally) by the presence of professional actors, who know a thing or two about comedy, being committed to the job of making laugh. In `Serving Sara' precious supports such as Bruce Campbell and Cedric the Entertainer show that they know their jobs, not the leading actors, especially Hurley. She is beautiful to be sure, but the film needs the down-to-earth personality, not the dead serious beauty, to make everything work as comedy. She once came closest to that kind of quality in `Austin Powers: International man of Mystery.' So why did she step out of the series, and went on to do more duds like this?",2,Neither Funny Nor Romantic: Worth Mostly For Precious Supports Like Campbell and Cedric the Entertainer,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,3354,"['strange', 'true', 'reasons', 'Heaven', 'only', 'someone', 'one', 'Japanese', 'distributing', 'company', 'decided', 'theatrically', 'release', 'Serving', 'Sara', 'Japan', '26th', 'November', '2005', 'same', 'day', 'fourth', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'Not', 'very', 'clever', 'way', 'doing', 'business', 'thought', 'anyway', 'went', 'see', 'not', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'underrated', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'best', 'known', 'Ash', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'trilogy', 'Well', 'was', 'good', 'so', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'film', 'was', 'dull', 'comedy', 'beginning', 'end.The', 'hero', 'film', 'played', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'character', 'Joe', 'Tyler', 'process', 'server', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'one', 'Hired', 'shifty', 'Ray', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Joe', 'life', 'delivering', 'process', 'job', 'unique', 'choice', 'comedy', 'let', 'give', 'due', 'credit', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Friends', 'very', 'much', 'Perry', 'always', 'amusing', 'see', 'when', 'doing', 'character', 'ridiculous', 'situation', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'Yes', 'sequel', 'was', 'terrible', 'know', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'funny.Now', 'enters', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'Sara', 'whom', 'Joe', 'process', 'usual', 'philandering', 'husband', 'Gordon', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'divorce', 'quite', 'Sara', 'who', 'turn', 'offers', 'lucrative', 'job', 'Joe', 'forget', 'process', 'give', 'HER', 'notice', 'husband', 'instead', 'get', 'lots', 'money', 'legal', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'set-up', 'comedy', 'adequate.But', 'something', 'wrong', 'film', 'Slow', 'storytelling', 'lazy', 'gags', 'are', 'part', 'reasons', 'most', 'damaging', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'Hurley', 'Perry', 'one', 'scene', 'Joe', 'Sara', 'decide', 'share', 'motel', 'room', 'one', 'night', 'situation', 'should', 'be', 'chance', 'establish', 'romantic', 'feeling', 'Instead', 'relations', 'remain', 'same', 'emotional', 'change', 'seen', 'Even', 'when', 'kiss', 'other', 'scene', 'still', 'emotionally', 'cold', 'actors', 'lack', 'efforts', 'be', 'character', 'are', 'be', 'blamed', 'perhaps', 'stereotyped', 'descriptions', 'Texas', 'are', 'be', 'faulted', 'probably', 'think', 'director', 'fault', 'Reginald', 'Hudlin', 'previous', 'film', 'was', 'awful', 'Ladies', 'Man', 'who', 'content', 'generic', 'silly', 'slapstick', 'gags', 'occasionally', 'shown', 'here', 'there', 'Hurley', 'pants', 'ripped', 'Perry', 'drinking', 'bad', 'wine', 'spitting', 'out', 'etc', 'none', 'really', 'funny', 'one', 'horrible', 'extended', 'gross-out', 'gag', 'scene', 'one', 'more', 'addition', 'tradition', ""Let's-humiliate-cows-and-laugh"", 'sequences', 'one', 'Perry', 'hands', 'got', 'stuck', 'middle', 'embarrassing', 'place', 'poor', 'animal.But', 'terrible', 'moments', 'could', 'be', 'improved', 'not', 'totally', 'presence', 'professional', 'actors', 'who', 'know', 'thing', 'two', 'comedy', 'being', 'committed', 'job', 'making', 'laugh', 'Serving', 'Sara', 'precious', 'supports', 'such', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'show', 'know', 'jobs', 'not', 'leading', 'actors', 'especially', 'Hurley', 'beautiful', 'be', 'sure', 'film', 'down-to-earth', 'personality', 'not', 'dead', 'serious', 'beauty', 'make', 'everything', 'work', 'comedy', 'once', 'came', 'closest', 'kind', 'quality', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'International', 'man', 'Mystery', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'step', 'out', 'series', 'went', 'do', 'more', 'duds']",N/A
