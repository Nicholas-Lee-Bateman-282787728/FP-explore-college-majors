Although it may never get the props it deserves. I hadn't even heard of this movie, and might not even know about it if I hadn't caught it on at a friends house, she told me it was ""really good"" so I sat and watched it. She was on point, I am so glad I got exposed to this movie. It's so funny, there were more times then I can remember in it where I was laughing out loud. It's scene after scene of stupid antics & at times gross humor. The scene with the 2 prostitutes had me dying! Mitch Malany is great in it, I think it would have been funny even if a ""brother"" had played the lead role. The writing is just that good, but the fact it's a white boy in the hood makes it that much better. He pulls off the white who think's he's black role with perfection. I also love how clueless he comes across. The entire cast is funny, and there is definitely chemistry between them. Renaldo Ray as Dereks (Mitch) Uncle, all I can say is wow! I can only hope there is a sequal. Well only if can follow in the steps on this one. I can't see a 2nd one possibly being better, this is one of those movies that was done right in every aspect.",5,Run little Gay Erkel run!,998697600,"08 25, 2001",2001,1219,"['movie', 'urban', 'slapstick', 'best', 'Just', 'Friday', 'was', 'Breaks', 'classic', 'may', 'never', 'get', 'props', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'heard', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'had', ""n't"", 'caught', 'friends', 'house', 'told', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'sat', 'watched', 'was', 'point', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'got', 'exposed', 'movie', 'so', 'funny', 'were', 'more', 'times', 'then', 'can', 'remember', 'where', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'scene', 'scene', 'stupid', 'antics', 'times', 'gross', 'humor', 'scene', '2', 'prostitutes', 'had', 'dying', 'Mitch', 'Malany', 'great', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'even', 'brother', 'had', 'played', 'lead', 'role', 'writing', 'just', 'good', 'fact', 'white', 'boy', 'hood', 'much', 'better', 'white', 'who', 'think', 'black', 'role', 'perfection', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'clueless', 'entire', 'cast', 'funny', 'definitely', 'chemistry', 'Renaldo', 'Ray', 'Dereks', 'Mitch', 'Uncle', 'can', 'say', 'wow', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'sequal', 'Well', 'only', 'can', 'follow', 'steps', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', '2nd', 'one', 'possibly', 'being', 'better', 'one', 'movies', 'was', 'done', 'right', 'aspect']",N/A
