310892,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6302413427,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[29, 29]","The extraordinary talents of both Fred Zinnemann and Montgomery Clift combine to make this superb, and sadly neglected film a memorable experience. Filmed in the U.S. occupied zone of Berlin, it shows the devastated city in the aftermath of World War II, and the suffering of its lost and orphaned children.The plot concerns a 9 year old boy, who has amnesia, and his relationship with an American soldier, and there is a secondary plot of his mother, who is looking for him. It is sentimental, but escapes being contrived or cloying, and I find myself repeatedly moved to tears with every viewing of it.As with so many of Zinnemann's films, the black and white cinematography (by Emil Berna) has a simple, stark beauty.  Both Zinnemann and Clift, whose incredibly sensitive portrayal of the soldier is riveting, were nominated for Oscars, but lost to John Huston (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre) and Laurence Olivier (Hamlet).A special juvenile Oscar went to Ivan Jandl, who so convincingly plays the little boy, and it was to be the only film he would ever act in.This was the first time movie audiences had a chance to see the handome Clift; even though he had already filmed Howard Hawks' Red River, this film was released first, and it is a must-see for fans of this graceful, fabulous actor. Also highly recommended is his first film with Elizabeth Taylor, A Place in the Sun.",5,"an exquisite, tender film",1039219200,"12 7, 2002",2002,1384,"['extraordinary', 'talents', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'combine', 'make', 'superb', 'sadly', 'neglected', 'film', 'memorable', 'experience', 'Filmed', 'U.S.', 'occupied', 'zone', 'Berlin', 'devastated', 'city', 'aftermath', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'suffering', 'lost', 'orphaned', 'children.The', 'plot', '9', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'amnesia', 'relationship', 'American', 'soldier', 'secondary', 'plot', 'mother', 'who', 'looking', 'sentimental', 'being', 'contrived', 'cloying', 'find', 'repeatedly', 'moved', 'tears', 'viewing', 'it.As', 'so', 'many', 'Zinnemann', 'films', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'Emil', 'Berna', 'simple', 'stark', 'beauty', 'Zinnemann', 'Clift', 'incredibly', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'soldier', 'riveting', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'lost', 'John', 'Huston', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Hamlet', '.A', 'special', 'juvenile', 'Oscar', 'went', 'Ivan', 'Jandl', 'who', 'so', 'convincingly', 'little', 'boy', 'was', 'be', 'only', 'film', 'would', 'ever', 'act', 'in.This', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'audiences', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'handome', 'Clift', 'even', 'had', 'already', 'filmed', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Red', 'River', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'first', 'must-see', 'fans', 'graceful', 'fabulous', 'actor', 'Also', 'highly', 'recommended', 'first', 'film', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'A', 'Place', 'Sun']",N/A

Slipman,"[2, 3]","Fred Zinnemann directed a powerful, touching and realistic movie ""The Search"" amid the devastation of a war ravaged post World War 2 Germany.  Thousands of bewildered children surviviors of concentration camps are pouring into Allied sponsored refugee camps.  One such child Karel Malik played by 10 year old Ivan  Jandl, a Czech born Auschwitz survivor in confusion runs away from his saviors.  Scrounging around the rubble of a bombed out German city, he is discovered by a sympathetic American soldier Ralph Stevenson played by a youthful Montgomery Clift.Clift takes pity on the boy and takes him in, mentoring him and wishing to adopt him and bring him to America.  Meanwhile Mrs. Malik the only other family member that has survived the war, played by Czech operatic star Jarmila Novotna, is going from camp to camp searching for the boy.  Clift is forced to return home to the U.S.  He is compelled to leave the boy in the camp, where he happily has a tearful reunion with his mother, who works as a teacher there.This movie filmed in a quasi-documentary style very authentically depicts the devastation to both cities and families as a result of the war.  The inhumanity that created the horrific conditions that tore apart families hovers over the setting of the flick.

For hundreds of thousands of civilians, the war had separated families, with parents and children in search of each other.  In THE SEARCH, director Fred Zinnemann presents a stark and depressing montage of a war blasted Berlin full of helpless and hapless lost souls.  Jamilla Novotna is Mrs. Malik, a Czechk woman who has lost her husband to the war and is determined not to lose her son, Karil (Ivan Jandl), even though she has not seen him for many months nor does she have a reasonable basis to assume that he still lives.  She trudges through one whistle stop after another never giving up.  Novotna's performance is stunning on several levels.  At no time does she come off as a self-deluded figure who ignores the lack of evidence for her son's survival.  There are times when she is overwhelmed with despair but her inner sense of grittiness pushes her on.  She is a kind woman whom people, especially children, gravitate towards.  Unknown to her, her son Karil lives in a nearby Displaced Person orphanage. He runs away only to be befriended by an American soldier (Montgomery Clift), who promptly provides the needed father image in the boy's life.  The movie is really a character magnet, with the mother seeking the boy from a long distance and the American soldier having the attraction to the boy up close.THE SEARCH is a sentimental look at a most unsentimental era in European history.  It would have been too easy for director Zinnemann to be cloying in the mother-son's eventual reunion. Instead, the resolution is anticipated and eagerly sought for.  As I watched the attempts of a group of kind hearted orphanage workers struggle incessantly to repair the ruins of a blighted Europe, I realized that the search for one's lost family often involve a search within one's own soul for the strength to continue that search.

The American troops are doing what they can to help, but these children are scarred by their experiences in the war. One child in particular is especially lost; Karel (Ivan Jandl) does not remember where he lived before he was sent to a concentration camp or what his own name is. He repeats to everyone, ""I don't know"" despite their attempts to help him. In fact, his mother (Jarmila Novotna) is still alive and is searching for her son, the only surviving member of her family. However, Karel is scared and runs away from the orphanage. An American soldier finds him (Montgomery Clift) and gains his trust. He names the boy Jimmy and teaches him English. However, Steve has to leave for America and can't take the boy with him.This film is an effective look at wartorn Europe and the terrors the war inflicted upon children. The effect is quite depressing, especially at the beginning. Jandl makes a great subject; he is really sweet, but also appropriately animalistic in his early scenes.
