She was nice to look at in Sucker Punch and The Uninvited, but here she shows she has real acting chops. She is in every scene, and many of those scenes consist of very long takes, with the camera barely moving. This is also a brave performance many young actresses wouldn't be willing to do - Browning is nude for much of the running time she is naked so much that after a while you won't even think about it.The movie is a melodramatic slow moving story about a young woman coming of age who is caught in a rock and a hard place in a financial insecure world where she tries just to make enough money to survive. She feels like everything in life forces you to be a slave to the system, so much that she sells her body for sex, science experiments, waitressing, and zombie drone office slave. She finally gets a big brake where she has a chance to make unbelievable money for being a Submissive Sex Slave, and she is lucky enough to get this job in a reputable Escort Services Firm where they forbid penetration,.... at lest for their entry level internships.",4,Slow movie but well worth the watch.....

1504859,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005WV6YW0,A kids review,"[15, 21]","There were some who initially balked at Sleeping Beauty, what with its explicitly adult themes and the considerably youthful countenance of its star, Emily Browning. And while erotic drama has been somewhat successful recently, I don;t know how to feel about Sleeping Beauty. Based on the 1961 Japanese novella The House of Sleeping Beauties by Yasunari Kawabata, the film stars Browning as Lucy, a troubled yet morose university student who responds to an ad looking for a lingerie-clad server for upscale clients. Before long, she is invited to take things a step further: drink a sedative and lie naked in bed as men of high profile lie next to her -- with ""no penetration"" -- and soon the experience begins affecting her daily life. Australian novelist Julia Leigh makes her directorial debut with Sleeping Beauty, and while I connected with the film's underlying feminist themes and like Leigh's confident hand, I found it cold, inscrutable, and exploitative.

I am a lover of film, and I am open to all styles of film, whether they're money guzzlers or experimental arthouse features. This film is totally arthouse, and it is definitely beautiful to look at. Every shot is framed meticulously, the staging is almost theatrical, and the tone is very detached. It almost plays out like a modern erotic parable about sexploitation and the consequences of being apathetic. Although I felt the ending was lacking, I cannot say that I was at all bored with the overall film. I thought director Julia Leigh knew exactly what she was doing with this script, making us, the audience, feel almost as removed as Lucy (Emily Browning) was with her circumstances. She seemed to live her life on autopilot, scraping up cash wherever it was offered, even at the expense of exploiting and brutalizing her body. I can understand why many would fail to enjoy Sleeping Beauty... it is rarely articulate and barely explores any other asset of this demeaning profession... but it asks us to perceive a world the way a very flawed young woman perceives it where everyone, including she, has a hidden agenda, and where there is a very fine line between civilization and the baser instincts of man. Leigh shoots many scenes of sexual perversions occurring behind closed doors, and it is almost her declaration of man's need to compartmentalize his secrets as a means of coping with his flawed humanity.

1504896,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005WV6YW0,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[102, 118]","On paper, Sleeping Beauty is a great idea. If the film is horrible, you have actress Emily Browning walking around naked for a good majority of the film. How can you lose right? Well, Julia Leigh's directorial debut fails to even be erotic. There's nothing particular titillating about it, so the sexual content doesn't even compensate for how unengaging the film is. In 2008, the script made the 2008 Black List of the best unproduced screenplays going around Hollywood. I'm starting to doubt the validity of the Black List, considering the last film I read about making this list was Cop Out. Sleeping Beauty premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and received a lukewarm reception in its limited release. The next time you hear someone negatively describe a film as ""pretentious art house fare,"" you can look to this film to get a better understanding of what they mean.Emily Browning plays Lucy, a university student with a number of odd jobs. There's little insight into her personality, although we see her at a club agreeing to have sex with a man as the result of a coin toss. Lucy responds to an ad in the student newspaper and meets Clara (Rachael Blake), who tells her the job is freelance silver service (basically a waitress) where she'll be clad only in lingerie (others are nearly naked) catering to upper-class, mostly older men. Remember the orgy in Eyes Wide Shut? It's easy to imagine those same people in attendance being served here. It's similarly elite and mysterious. As an employee, Lucy is called Sara and is told on the first day to match her lipstick to the color of her labia. Clara soon requests Lucy for a different type of job. She's given a drink that puts her to sleep, her sedated body is put in a bed, and men are allowed to join her to do whatever they wish, with a strict ""no penetration"" rule.Sounds fascinating right? Well, it's not. I have to give it some credit though. Obviously, this material could've been presented in a trashy, exploitive way; instead it's an art house snoozefest that seems to be trying way too hard. It only seems exploitive because of how utterly pointless it seems. Not concerned with plot or character, it builds on neither. Most of the dialogue is trivial, providing neither insight nor explanation. Browning is in every scene of the film (or close to it) and her character Lucy is completely without depth. We watch her interact with her two landlords, who clearly aren't fond of her but it doesn't explore that any further. She has some sort of emotional relationship with a man her age, known only as Birdman (Ewen Leslie) whose drug addiction is killing him, but whatever.There are minimal cuts, with most scenes composed of unbroken shots. The camera holds on the subject until a cut is absolutely necessarily, usually at the start of a new scene. With her filmmaking techniques, Leigh makes the audience a voyeur, with no emotional connection to what we're seeing. Sleeping Beauty is a cold, distant film that treats us like Lucy's customers; we can get close, but with no penetration. I'm not sure how the film benefits from Leigh's treatment of the subject. Perhaps it's commenting on the sexual exploitation of women and the way it's often passively regarded. Or even the emotionless way in which women allow themselves to be sexually exploited. Or maybe I'm just searching too deeply for a reason to have sat through the film.The film is unafraid to take its time. In one instance, the camera holds on the face of an old man describing a book he discovered earlier that day and re-read. It's a long-winded (five minute), roundabout and pretentious way of giving us needless insight into this character. If this sounds like a negative critique of the scene, let me clarify; it's one of the best scenes in the film.Most of the attention will be focused on the 23-year-old Emily Browning, who has been acting since the age of ten. The role does little for her, besides helping her shed her child-actress image by shedding all her clothes. It's a mature film made for mature audiences that has her wandering through much of it fully naked, but it doesn't allow her to show off the range or depth of her ability as an actress. Her innocent face and pale white skin make her an appropriate choice for the role, but it's unfortunate how one-dimensional it is through no fault of her own. She exposes her body, but the script gives her nothing else to expose. I don't need the psychological complexities of a character spoon-fed to me, but this goes beyond subtlety; there's nothing there.It is a brave performance, considering she has to lie almost entirely motionless under old, naked men while they say and do vulgar things to her. She's smart to do it in a film that fancies itself art rather than an exploitation film. On making Sleeping Beauty, Browning said ""Even reading the screenplay, it made me feel uncomfortable. But that was something that attracted me to it. I would prefer to polarize an audience as opposed to making an entertaining film everybody feels ambivalent about."" I respect that outlook, but Sleeping Beauty is so cold it's not even discomforting. It renders you a passive observer. Browning is as good as she can be in the role, my only complaint being her screaming in the second to last scene. It didn't sit right with me, seeming unnatural and forced.Let me be clear, I didn't hate Sleeping Beauty. I admire elements of Browning's performance, the austerity of Leigh's direction; I spent more time waiting for something to happen than I did waiting for it to end. The only time the monotony is broken is when a bit of a curveball is thrown towards the end, but the last shot is a slap in the face. It's abrupt, frustrating, and takes itself so seriously it's obnoxious. A film doesn't need to be meaningful; it has many functions it can serve, but what is this one's? Besides an excuse for Browning to take off her clothes, what has been said? Sleeping Beauty is lovely to look at sometimes, but it's so uninvolving you won't even be inspired to get up and turn it off halfway through.GRADE: D",2,"A Pretentious, Art House

1504900,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005WV6YW0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","I can certainly understand why some do not connect with Julia Leigh's art house provocation ""Sleeping Beauty."" I found it a fascinating, if flawed, interpretation of the classic story by Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata. (In a stroke of coincidence, I also recently viewed the German film ""House of the Sleeping Beauties""). Interestingly, Leigh switches up the narrative vantage point. In both the source novella and the previous film version, the tale is told from a male client's perspective. This piece is seen from a female viewpoint, at least when she isn't sleeping! I thought this had a great deal of potential. The subject of ""Sleeping Beauty"" is an intriguing and bizarre one. It focuses on a professional establishment in which men pay to spend the night with young women who are passed out. The encounters are not necessarily sexual in nature, but often about loneliness, desperation, and/or companionship. This movie, therefore, held the promise of revealing the ""whys"" behind those who would work there when we'd only ever seen it from the other side.Emily Browning plays the central figure, a somewhat enigmatic young woman trying to makes ends meet. We see her through a series of odd jobs and random sexual encounters, but she always remains an aloof presence. This being an arty exploration of sensuality, the dialogue can be rather sparse and the character interactions somewhat empty. Therefore, Browning (a talented actress) exercises few emotions--flirtatious or vacant with little middle ground. Any hopes of identifying with her motivations are quickly dashed and she remains a cipher throughout. When she finally gets around to the sleeping arrangement, it seems to be for no other reason than financial independence. As she so carelessly and wantonly seems to accept her lot as a sexual being, there is little time for introspection. Things get decidedly more dramatic, but as we don't really know Browning as a real person, it is hard to muster much actual interest or emotion about her circumstances.Still, I didn't think ""Sleeping Beauty"" was a complete write-off by any means. Browning may be one to watch, she has genuine presence. The film is intriguing in its subject matter and is executed well. But it still feels too hollow, like there's a huge void at its center. If Leigh wanted to leave her central character so open-ended, that's fine. But it caused me to limit my investment in the film's outcome. Wanted to love the movie, but I found it an interesting experiment that I never fully connected with.

1504901,AOZFQAPPLMVOB,B005WV6YW0,"Lone Alaskan Gypsy ""Lone Alaskan Gypsy""","[6, 6]","There seem to be a few misconceptions about this film. And I'm surprised to see so many people rating it one star. It's an Australian indie-like film. I thoroughly enjoyed it. But I do feel there are a few things that need to be cleared up:This is not an adult film. There is nudity of both male and females. In fact there is more male nudity than female nudity, so for people who are often turned away by that- they probably won't enjoy this film. But the nudity should not even be the main focus. It seems to me too many people made it into a big deal when in fact it was merely a minor detail. The filming is done tastefully and in a way that does not exploit the naked being film. Rather it simply portrays the characters, participating in whatever act they may be in, in a way that is honest- not pornographic. For those looking for a film of a sexual nature, I suggest looking elsewhere. Granted this film has many sexual scenes, but it is in no way an adult film.This film is artistically done in a way that forces you to think. The creators obviously did not want a storyline that describes everything in minor detail. And I find it irritating that so many people expect films to spell things out for us. People writing reviews here seem to be complaining that the storyline was incomplete. It was meant to be- they wanted you to think. It's a film that forces you to look deeper rather than mindlessly watch. If you're looking for a typical boring tell-it-like-it-is film, go somewhere else. But if you want something so vividly portrayed that it will remain engrained in your memory, even after watching it, this is the right film to watch.People also seem to say that this film is slow paced or has many empty spaces. Both could be true, but if you look at the film for what it is- a very artistic portrayal of the modern brothel trade, then you'll find the slow pace and empty spaces accentuate the story rather than dismember it. The film accurately and realistically captures a modern experience in aristocracy prostitution. This is not a cheap 'hop in a car' sort of ordeal, but rather a very thought-through process that involves people of a higher class. The films characters are both easy to hate and love- depending on where you stand and whether or not you can relate with them. The main character is a girl, quite lost and looking for financial freedom- who finds herself star struck by the larger paychecks of a prostitution gig that involves letting herself sleep while older men... experience her. Most of these men are passed their ability to perform and do not wish to do anything but live their younger days vicariously through her sleeping body. But obviously each men has his own story- and in this film you'll find them all. Some parts are very difficult to watch. Some characters you will hate and hold animosity to, others you will empathize with, and some you will simply pity. There are no definite characters that you can truly &#34;love&#34;, if you capture them honestly. None are good, and none are evil. They're human, and I think that's what makes the storyline so magnificent. There is exquisite trait to one character that makes them better than the others. They're all equal in their own ways.The filming is done very simply. The sets are simple. But these all mimic the simple storyline. There are parts that will perhaps confuse you- but I found these thought-provoking. I loved watching a film that introduced me to a new way of thinking. I found the subject matter tastefully portrayed. I sympathized and hated characters. I was completely enveloped in the story. And this movie is definitely one I have not easily forgotten. It's certainly among one of my recent favorites.",5,Beautiful Portrayel of Modern Aristocracy Prostitution,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,3721,"['seem', 'be', 'few', 'misconceptions', 'film', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'rating', 'one', 'star', 'Australian', 'indie-like', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'do', 'feel', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'need', 'be', 'cleared', 'up', 'not', 'adult', 'film', 'nudity', 'male', 'females', 'fact', 'more', 'male', 'nudity', 'female', 'nudity', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'often', 'turned', 'away', 'that-', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'nudity', 'should', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'main', 'focus', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'made', 'big', 'deal', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'merely', 'minor', 'detail', 'filming', 'done', 'tastefully', 'way', 'not', 'exploit', 'naked', 'being', 'film', 'simply', 'characters', 'participating', 'act', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'honest-', 'not', 'pornographic', 'looking', 'film', 'sexual', 'nature', 'suggest', 'looking', 'elsewhere', 'Granted', 'film', 'many', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'way', 'adult', 'film.This', 'film', 'artistically', 'done', 'way', 'think', 'creators', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'storyline', 'everything', 'minor', 'detail', 'find', 'irritating', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'expect', 'films', 'spell', 'things', 'out', 'People', 'writing', 'reviews', 'here', 'seem', 'be', 'complaining', 'storyline', 'was', 'incomplete', 'was', 'meant', 'be-', 'wanted', 'think', 'film', 'look', 'deeper', 'rather', 'mindlessly', 'watch', ""'re"", 'looking', 'typical', 'boring', 'tell-it-like-it-is', 'film', 'go', 'somewhere', 'else', 'want', 'something', 'so', 'vividly', 'portrayed', 'will', 'remain', 'engrained', 'memory', 'even', 'watching', 'right', 'film', 'watch.People', 'also', 'seem', 'say', 'film', 'slow', 'paced', 'many', 'empty', 'spaces', 'could', 'be', 'true', 'look', 'film', 'what', 'very', 'artistic', 'portrayal', 'modern', 'brothel', 'trade', 'then', ""'ll"", 'find', 'slow', 'pace', 'empty', 'spaces', 'accentuate', 'story', 'rather', 'dismember', 'film', 'accurately', 'realistically', 'modern', 'experience', 'aristocracy', 'prostitution', 'not', 'cheap', ""'hop"", 'car', 'sort', 'ordeal', 'rather', 'very', 'thought-through', 'process', 'people', 'higher', 'class', 'films', 'characters', 'are', 'easy', 'hate', 'love-', 'depending', 'where', 'stand', 'not', 'can', 'relate', 'main', 'character', 'girl', 'quite', 'lost', 'looking', 'financial', 'freedom-', 'who', 'star', 'struck', 'larger', 'paychecks', 'prostitution', 'gig', 'letting', 'sleep', 'older', 'men', 'experience', 'Most', 'men', 'are', 'passed', 'ability', 'perform', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'do', 'anything', 'live', 'younger', 'days', 'vicariously', 'sleeping', 'body', 'obviously', 'men', 'own', 'story-', 'film', ""'ll"", 'find', 'parts', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'characters', 'will', 'hate', 'hold', 'animosity', 'others', 'will', 'empathize', 'will', 'simply', 'pity', 'are', 'definite', 'characters', 'can', 'truly', '34', 'love', '34', 'capture', 'honestly', 'None', 'are', 'good', 'none', 'are', 'evil', ""'re"", 'human', 'think', 'what', 'storyline', 'so', 'magnificent', 'exquisite', 'trait', 'one', 'character', 'better', 'others', ""'re"", 'equal', 'own', 'ways.The', 'filming', 'done', 'very', 'simply', 'sets', 'are', 'simple', 'mimic', 'simple', 'storyline', 'are', 'parts', 'will', 'perhaps', 'confuse', 'you-', 'found', 'thought-provoking', 'loved', 'watching', 'film', 'introduced', 'new', 'way', 'thinking', 'found', 'subject', 'matter', 'tastefully', 'portrayed', 'sympathized', 'hated', 'characters', 'was', 'completely', 'enveloped', 'story', 'movie', 'definitely', 'one', 'have', 'not', 'easily', 'forgotten', 'certainly', 'one', 'recent', 'favorites']",N/A

1504911,AVDLF7OP7O39J,B005WV6YW0,Ralph Jenkins,"[170, 185]","Emily Browning stars as a detached, reckless young woman who takes a job as a sex worker - although no actual sex is allowed.  Instead, she is put to sleep, and clients pay to do things to her while she sleeps.  To her, her body is just a thing to be used.  But how different is it from being an office drone, making copies all day or busing the same tables every night?  Eventually, however, she can't help but be curious about what goes on while she's asleep....Emily Browning is terrific in this film.  She was nice to look at in Sucker Punch and The Uninvited, but here she shows she has real acting chops.  She is in every scene, and many of those scenes consist of very long takes, with the camera barely moving.  This is also a brave performance many young actresses wouldn't be willing to do - Browning is nude for much of the running time (she is naked so much that after a while you won't even think about it).This movie will obviously not be for all tastes.  It's an art film.  The pacing is slow, there's hardly any music and most of the characters are unlikeable.  This is the kind of movie that's meant to unsettle and make you think rather than to simply entertain.  I would recommend it to cinephiles, but people who find art films ""boring"" and think The Criterion Collection is overrated may wish to look elsewhere.I'm glad that more of these smaller arthouse films are being made available to watch online.  Most of the time it's impossible to see them in the theater unless you live in a large city or want to drive a long distance, and you can only read about them while waiting however many months it takes for the DVD.I would be willing to buy this on Blu-ray, but as of this writing a Blu-ray has only been announced for the U.K. I have a feeling this will only be on DVD in the U.S., and if so, it's a shame.",4,"A slow burn, but spellbinding",1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,1832,"['Emily', 'Browning', 'stars', 'detached', 'reckless', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'job', 'sex', 'worker', 'actual', 'sex', 'allowed', 'Instead', 'put', 'sleep', 'clients', 'pay', 'do', 'things', 'body', 'just', 'thing', 'be', 'used', 'how', 'different', 'being', 'office', 'drone', 'making', 'copies', 'day', 'busing', 'same', 'tables', 'night', 'Eventually', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'curious', 'what', 'asleep', '.Emily', 'Browning', 'terrific', 'film', 'was', 'nice', 'look', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'Uninvited', 'here', 'real', 'acting', 'chops', 'scene', 'many', 'scenes', 'consist', 'very', 'long', 'camera', 'barely', 'moving', 'also', 'brave', 'performance', 'many', 'young', 'actresses', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'willing', 'do', 'Browning', 'nude', 'much', 'running', 'time', 'naked', 'so', 'much', 'while', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'obviously', 'not', 'be', 'tastes', 'art', 'film', 'pacing', 'slow', 'hardly', 'music', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'unlikeable', 'kind', 'movie', 'meant', 'unsettle', 'make', 'think', 'rather', 'simply', 'entertain', 'would', 'recommend', 'cinephiles', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'art', 'films', 'boring', 'think', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'overrated', 'may', 'wish', 'look', 'elsewhere.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'more', 'smaller', 'arthouse', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'available', 'watch', 'online', 'Most', 'time', 'impossible', 'see', 'theater', 'live', 'large', 'city', 'want', 'drive', 'long', 'distance', 'can', 'only', 'read', 'waiting', 'however', 'many', 'months', 'DVD.I', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'buy', 'Blu-ray', 'writing', 'Blu-ray', 'only', 'been', 'announced', 'U.K', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'DVD', 'U.S.', 'so', 'shame']",N/A

That's pretty much the entire plot of the movie as she sleeps her way through the film with friends, lovers, and total strangers.  The ending could have been so much more powerful, but the director/script-writer/whomever left their imagination in their desk that day and chose trite instead.I have friends with whom I absolutely love to discuss the movies we watch.

1504913,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B005WV6YW0,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[1, 1]","Emily Browning starts in Jane Campion's new movie.  ""Sleeping Beauty"" is an art movie that will divide audience to two distinct groups: love the move and hate the movie kinds.  To me personally this film is multifaceted.  If one thinks of the fairy tale ""Sleeping Beauty"" it is a story about the young woman, put to sleep by the evil witch and woken up from her long dream by the handsome prince.  In this story, beautiful young woman is put to sleep by the madam who assures her that she will never be sexually violated while asleep.  Her indiference towards the world around her is complementing her new world of a woman whose body is used by older man in a ways she cannot imagine.  Lucy, which is the girl's name, becomes Sarah for the purposes of these sessions.  She is well compensated for her time and her services.  And she cannot recall what clients do to her during hours of her sleep.Over time, Lucy becomes curious about what happens to her while she is asleep.  But her madam is not interested in making exceptions and allowing her to observe what clients do with her while she is asleep.  Until one day, Lucy, the sleeping beauty, awakens to find out that life will never be happily ever after.  Like many of her clients, she will be broken to pieces and she will have the rest of her life to live with those emotions.Controversial film that looks at disenchanted young woman unable to connect to the world around her.

1504915,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005WV6YW0,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 12]","&lt;strong>Sleeping Beauty&lt;/strong> (Julia Leigh, 2011)A friend of mine said that one of the reasons &lt;em>The Uninvited&lt;/em>, the not-bad-but-certainly-not-good American remake of &lt;em>A Tale of Two Sisters&lt;/em>, got made was so the Bros. Guard could showcase wholesome Emily Browning in her underwear. This is not something I had a problem with, as I am just about as obsessed with Emily Browning as every other average heterosexual male. Like Pauline Etienne (above), Browning absolutely qualifies for inclusion in my upcoming coffee table book, &lt;em>Delicious Dishes&lt;/em>. (Note: that was a joke. Can you imagine what the licensing fees on such a beast would run?) And really, she began her career in B-horror (&lt;em>Ghost Ship&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Darkness Falls&lt;/em>) and Australian TV series before becoming the face of Violet Baudelaire, the much-beloved heroine of Lemony Snicket's &lt;em>A Series of Unfortunate Events&lt;/em>; I'm not sure she was ever all that wholesome. That's just how we in America pictured her, since most of us never got to see &lt;em>Ned Kelly&lt;/em>. But if Browning were going to try and break out of that ""wholesome"" mode, she couldn't have picked a better picture to do it than &lt;em>Sleeping Beauty&lt;/em>, a bleak, kinky, utterly cheerless film that seems to be aiming at something--but the more critical assessments I read of the film, the more it strikes me that Leigh seems to have pushed the kink factor too far. For the first couple of days I was reading up on this movie, I was having a hard time finding anyone who'd actually finished watching it. I, too, ended up hating it, but for what seem to be entirely different reasons than everyone else.Plot: Lucy (Browning) is a college student, managing to shoehorn classes in between the many jobs she's doing to keep being able to afford tuition, rent, and schoolbooks--she's a medical guinea pig, busgirl at a local restaurant, does...something...in an office that involves a great deal of using the spiral binder in the copy room. Somehow, despite all this, she also finds time to pick up random men in bars by being brazen. (Leigh is playing us here; every male watching this movie thought exactly the same thing the first time that scene played out: ""that NEVER happens to me! If it ever does, I hope it's Emily Browning doing it..."".) As far as I can tell, her sexual forwardness is in some way related to the fact that the guy she is/actually wants to be in a relationship with, Birdmann (&lt;em>Jewboy&lt;/em>'s Ewen Leslie), is so socially inept/depressive that he can't, or won't, enter into anything like a normal romantic relationship. (We also find out later there's at least one ex-boyfriend in her life who has proposed to her.) In any case, her need for money and her love of sex combine when she answers an ad for an escort service. But this is not your typical escort service. Her first gig, she is dressed entirely in white lingerie, while the four other women working with her are dressed all in black. Their [censored for Amazon consumption] are exposed, she just has a hint of [censored for Amazon consumption] peeking over the top. (No, there's no symbolism going on here.) Her entire job involves serving wine to a number of rich old man while they're having dinner, then serving brandy while they're doing the after-dinner cigar thing. All well and good. Her new boss, Clara (&lt;em>Lantana&lt;/em>'s Rachael Blake), impressed with her work, thinks it may be time for her to step up to sleeping beautydom, where she will be placed in a bed, drugged to unconsciousness, so rich old men can do basically whatever they want to her without her knowledge. (Clara stresses two rules: no penetration, and no visible marks. At least one man violates the second rule in a suggested, but still particularly nasty, sequence.)All of this is well and good, and Leigh spent a great deal of time on her symbolism, as I mentioned above. One of the really impressive things about the way the movie is shot is Lucy's nudity; we do not see more than a few inches of skin at a time (at the beginning, Lucy is fond of knee-length pencil skirts when at school or in the office, jeans and T-shirts otherwise) until after the dinner scene. After that, both at work and in her personal life, Lucy spends more and more time naked. I am misspeaking, actually. We know from Lucy's character that she has always spent a great deal of time naked; Leigh only &lt;em>shows&lt;/em> this to us once Lucy has started working for Clara. It's a very nice conceit, and in fact it was probably my favorite thing about the film. Leigh spent a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of time thinking about this sort of thing.As well, it's worth noting that I've seen critics call this movie everything from ""erotic drama"" to ""cheap exploitation film"", but no one seems to have picked up on the one scene that tells you exactly what kind of movie this is. It's directly after the dinner scene. Lucy is back in her crappy little flat with the $250 she made from the evening. Presumably, this is more money than she has ever made for a night's work before. She spreads it out on the table, stares at it. Lights a cigarette. Picks up a hundred-dollar bill, lights it, and watches it burn. A sexy woman smoking and burning money. If there's a more iconic &lt;em>noir&lt;/em> image, I can't imagine what it would be. As such, you can slot all the conventions of &lt;em>noir&lt;/em> into place, and a lot of what comes after makes perfect sense--Lucy's questionable choices (not from the standpoint of morality--I have no problem with her choice of profession, as so many other reviewers did--but from the standpoint of her personal safety), the seemingly random tragic events, the overarching sense that this will not end well for anyone involved except Clara, the ice-queen crime-boss figure in the film. (And tell me that &lt;em>Mad Max&lt;/em>'s Hugh Keays-Byrne is not in this film because he resembles half the heavies in the gangster flicks you've seen and I will straight up call you a liar.)None of this is a bad thing(TM), and it all could have worked very well. The movie's problem is that it's incoherent--so much so that when I read Ebert's capsule review from CIFF 2011 I wondered if he'd seen a workprint rather than the final film. So much of this movie's character development seems to have been left on the cutting room floor that half the time you're wondering, in the scenes dealing with Lucy's personal life, just who the hell these people &lt;em>are&lt;/em>, anyway. Which makes sense when you're dealing with random strangers she's picking up in a bar, but the ex-boyfriend I mentioned? He pops up in one scene, there's a confrontation, and that's it. Wait, what? Where's the backstory on that? Wherever it is, it's not in the final film.The Sundance Selects promo copy focuses on the passivity of Lucy's life, and tells us that ""she finally develops the will to break the spell [of her passivity] by discovering what happens to her while she sleeps."" Um... again, were they watching a work print? The mechanism that &lt;em>might&lt;/em> cause Lucy to rethink her behavior is quite different (telling you what it is would be a spoiler, it's one of the movie's pivotal scenes), and we are never shown whether she actually does or not (this, on the other hand, is not a spoiler as long as you're thinking &lt;em>noir&lt;/em>).With a little more attention to the script--or a slightly less heavy hand in the editing room--this might well have been the insightful, razor-sharp feminist drama that about half the critics on Rotten Tomatoes make it out to be. As it is, it's nothing more than a confused mess. * ",2,This movie made me hate everyone involved.,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,7699,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'lt', '>', 'Julia',

She takes a job as a ""freelance"" private entertainer. Her first night after entertaining a party with other girls, she comes home and lights an Australian 100 dollar bill on fire? I did not get it in a practical sense considering she needed the money. What made it confusing to me is that her first night didn't seem to go so bad. There was no sex involved. She wore lingerie that covered up more of her than the other girl's outfits and all she did was pour drinks for the most part.Another odd scene, at her office job, she was laying down( not sleeping) on the floor in the middle of the copy room and her boss walked in on her. No explanation, nothing and her boss said nothing to her.She started to go to the home of her boss of the freelance job where she was given a drink to knock her out. She would sleep naked in bed while men came in to do bizarre things to her with one rule:  no penetration. Then a second rule: no leaving marks( after an incident).She was curious as to what went on and so decided to privately record one evening.

With these words, Sleeping Beauty establishes the ground rules and sets the scene for a bizarre sexual nightmare. The film is set in Australia but conceived in a high, contemporary European style: it is perpetually a surprise to realise the dialogue is in English and not French or Austrian-accented German.It is technically elegant, with vehemence and control, though often preposterous, with the imagined classiness of high-end prostitution and art-porn cliches of secret sexiness in grand chateaux: shades of Eyes Wide Shut.Author-turned-director Julia Leigh has certainly made an assured debut, which evidently owes nothing to Jane Campion who has ""presented"" this movie in some kind of Executive Mentor capacity. Instead, Leigh aims for the occult ritual of Bu&ntilde;uel and the formal exactitude of Haneke: rigorously framed and composed shots.Emily Browning gives a fierce and powerful performance, which should put her in the running for the festival's best actress prize; she is Lucy, a student who takes part-time jobs to pay her tuition. These include medical experimentation - an almost unwatchable, and crucially penetrative process in which a tube is inserted into her gullet - and occasional prostitution. From here, Lucy is inducted into a niche sex industry: elderly gentlemen in tuxedos hold dinner parties and pay beautiful young women to wait on them, almost naked. Her success leads to a lucrative ""sleeping beauty"" gig. She is drugged and these ageing, sagging sensualists can do whatever they wish to her naked body, except penetration. But Lucy becomes obsessed with knowing what is being done to her.The movie's emotional seriousness consists in Lucy's unhappy backstory: it is not merely a need for cash that has led her to this, but a kind of trauma and self-hate. She evidently had a painful and complex relationship with an agoraphobic drug addict called Birdmann (Ewen Leslie); he was and is clearly in love with her and, on her many visits, her affectionate friendship is complicated by unexpressed guilt at not feeling the same way or wanting to sleep with him.All of this Browning suggests in her sulky pouts, her suppressed tears, her angry blankness: especially when talking to her alcoholic mother on the phone. It all leads to the grotesque situation of lying in a drugged stupor for men who wish to indulge in a necrophile-rape fantasy. The sleeping beauty of the original fable fainted on pricking her finger on a spinning wheel, an image of a moment's daring combined with one of women's work and torpid docility. Lucy is certainly doing women's work: but what is she doing? Will she wake up to what is happening?The stomach-turning ""sex"" scenes themselves brutally show how unlovely is the ageing male body: and the penises here are pitifully unable even to attempt penetration. To some, the situation may call to mind Almodovar's Talk to Her or perhaps the denouement of Dennis Potter's Brimstone and Treacle. But there is force and originality in Leigh's work. Sleeping Beauty is an impressive technical display, though no more than the sum of its parts.",4,Sleeping Beauty,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,3161,"['vagina', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'penetrated', 'vagina', 'temple', 'words', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'ground', 'rules', 'scene', 'bizarre', 'sexual', 'nightmare', 'film', 'set', 'Australia', 'conceived', 'high', 'contemporary', 'European', 'style', 'perpetually', 'surprise', 'realise', 'dialogue', 'English', 'not', 'French', 'Austrian-accented', 'German.It', 'technically', 'elegant', 'vehemence', 'control', 'though', 'often', 'preposterous', 'imagined', 'classiness', 'high-end', 'prostitution', 'art-porn', 'cliches', 'secret', 'sexiness', 'grand', 'chateaux', 'shades', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut.Author-turned-director', 'Julia', 'Leigh', 'certainly', 'made', 'assured', 'debut', 'evidently', 'nothing', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'who', 'presented', 'movie', 'kind', 'Executive', 'Mentor', 'capacity', 'Instead', 'Leigh', 'occult', 'ritual', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'formal', 'exactitude', 'Haneke', 'rigorously', 'framed', 'composed', 'shots.Emily', 'Browning', 'fierce', 'powerful', 'performance', 'should', 'put', 'running', 'festival', 'best', 'actress', 'prize', 'Lucy', 'student', 'who', 'part-time', 'jobs', 'pay', 'tuition', 'include', 'medical', 'experimentation', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'crucially', 'penetrative', 'process', 'tube', 'inserted', 'gullet', 'occasional', 'prostitution', 'here', 'Lucy', 'inducted', 'niche', 'sex', 'industry', 'elderly', 'gentlemen', 'tuxedos', 'hold', 'dinner', 'parties', 'pay', 'beautiful', 'young', 'women', 'wait', 'almost', 'naked', 'success', 'lucrative', 'sleeping', 'beauty', 'gig', 'drugged', 'ageing', 'sagging', 'sensualists', 'can', 'do', 'wish', 'naked', 'body', 'penetration', 'Lucy', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'knowing', 'what', 'being', 'done', 'her.The', 'movie', 'emotional', 'seriousness', 'Lucy', 'unhappy', 'backstory', 'not', 'merely', 'need', 'cash', 'led', 'kind', 'trauma', 'self-hate', 'evidently', 'had', 'painful', 'complex', 'relationship', 'agoraphobic', 'drug', 'addict', 'called', 'Birdmann', 'Ewen', 'Leslie', 'was', 'clearly', 'love', 'many', 'visits', 'affectionate', 'friendship', 'complicated', 'unexpressed', 'guilt', 'not', 'feeling', 'same', 'way', 'wanting', 'sleep', 'him.All', 'Browning', 'sulky', 'pouts', 'suppressed', 'tears', 'angry', 'blankness', 'especially', 'when', 'talking', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'phone', 'grotesque', 'situation', 'lying', 'drugged', 'stupor', 'men', 'who', 'wish', 'indulge', 'necrophile-rape', 'fantasy', 'sleeping', 'beauty', 'original', 'fable', 'fainted', 'pricking', 'finger', 'spinning', 'wheel', 'image', 'moment', 'daring', 'combined', 'one', 'women', 'work', 'torpid', 'docility', 'Lucy', 'certainly', 'doing', 'women', 'work', 'what', 'doing', 'Will', 'wake', 'up', 'what', 'happening', 'stomach-turning', 'sex', 'scenes', 'brutally', 'show', 'how', 'unlovely', 'ageing', 'male', 'body', 'penises', 'here', 'are', 'pitifully', 'unable', 'even', 'attempt', 'penetration', 'situation', 'may', 'call', 'mind', 'Almodovar', 'Talk', 'perhaps', 'denouement', 'Dennis', 'Potter', 'Brimstone', 'Treacle', 'force', 'originality', 'Leigh', 'work', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'impressive', 'technical', 'display', 'more', 'sum', 'parts']",N/A
