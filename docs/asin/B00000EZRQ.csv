They were in stitches, but I had to fight very hard not to be a grump and prick the balloon of their amusement.

Bad or puerile humor springs from and encourages the immature tendency to laugh at others and in doing so to feel superior and &#34;with it&#34;. This film is full of bad humor. The amusement of my dear grandsons was understandable, but it embarrassed me to find their natural puerility encouraged. It is a gloomy thought that their silliness, forgivable at eleven or twelve, would, given no better entertainment than this, grown into the offensive and snorting animal-house silliness that disfigures much older folk in college frat houses and beyond.

Prior to ""Almost Heroes,"" Farley headlined roles in ""Tommy Boy,"" ""Black Sheep,"" ""Beverly Hills Ninja,"" and ""Dirty Work,"" the last of which was also released after his death.  Directed by Christopher Guest, ""Almost Heroes"" stars Matthew Perry as Leslie Edwards, Chris Farley as Bartholomew Hunt, Eugene Levy as Guy Fontenot, Bokeem Woodbine as Jonah, and Lisa Barbuscia as Shaquinna. Most audiences have rated ""Almost Heroes"" negatively; the film garnered 14% on the Rotten Tomatoes meter.  However, among its ""fan"" audience, Farley's performance has been remembered favorably.I, personally, do not think ""Almost Heroes"" is a great movie, but it does incorporate a lot of good light-hearted humor and many quotable lines.  This movie's downfall comes from a collection of sources; the screenplay can be a little boring and the chemistry among the cast just doesn't quite ""click.""  It is not one I watch often; when I'm in a Farley mood I usually go for ""Tommy Boy."" However, if you are a Chris Farley fan, I would recommend buying this DVD for nostalgic purposes and a few good laughs.  Below I have included a short summary of the plot in hopes that it might help anyone `on the fence' about whether to purchase the movie or maybe just rent.  Good luck!SUMMARY:  This movie is a historical parody of the western exploration of the United States and territories undertaken by Lewis & Clark in the early 1800s.  In the ""Almost Heroes"" comedic rendition, Leslie Edwards is a respected and wealthy society-man who sets off to map the ""unknown"" United States beginning at the Missouri River and ending at the Pacific, racing against the more famous team lead by Lewis and Clark.  Bartholomew Hunt, Edwards's foil character, is a fumbling miscreant employed among Edwards' party as a tracker.  Along the journey, the wide separation between Hunt and Edwards narrows as Edwards finally loosens up, finding love where he thought he was looking for glory.The fellowship appears to be doomed from the start when the audience is introduced to Edwards' bottom-of-the-barrel frontiersmen. Hopes for Edwards' expedition rise meagerly when the crew is joined by Shaquinna who presumably represents Lewis and Clark's Sacagawea.  Shaquinna, a young Native American, is instrumental in the party's mostly safe journey through the west; the ""mostly"" part imposed by the crew's antics and mishaps.  Ironically, Edwards' party beats Lewis and Clark's to the Pacific, yet in the interest of being ""Almost Heroes,"" the men decide they'd rather carry on exploring than presume they've found it all.",3,"""He's Got Somethin' In His Haaannds!!!""",1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,2823,"['Almost', 'Heroes', 'last', 'comedy', 'films', 'starring', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'who', 'passed', 'away', '1997', 'drug', 'overdose', 'just', 'shy', 'movie', '1998', 'release', 'production', 'had', 'been', 'postponed', 'several', 'occasions', 'due', 'Farley', 'attending', 'drug', 'rehabilitation', 'Prior', 'Almost', 'Heroes', 'Farley', 'headlined', 'roles', 'Tommy', 'Boy', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Ninja', 'Dirty', 'Work', 'last', 'was', 'also', 'released', 'death', 'Directed', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'Almost', 'Heroes', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'Leslie', 'Edwards', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'Bartholomew', 'Hunt', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Guy', 'Fontenot', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'Jonah', 'Lisa', 'Barbuscia', 'Shaquinna', 'Most', 'audiences', 'have', 'rated', 'Almost', 'Heroes', 'negatively', 'film', 'garnered', '14', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'meter', 'However', 'fan', 'audience', 'Farley', 'performance', 'been', 'remembered', 'favorably.I', 'personally', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Almost', 'Heroes', 'great', 'movie', 'incorporate', 'lot', 'good', 'light-hearted', 'humor', 'many', 'quotable', 'lines', 'movie', 'downfall', 'collection', 'sources', 'screenplay', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'boring', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'click', 'not', 'one', 'watch', 'often', 'when', ""'m"", 'Farley', 'mood', 'usually', 'go', 'Tommy', 'Boy', 'However', 'are', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'fan', 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'DVD', 'nostalgic', 'purposes', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'have', 'included', 'short', 'summary', 'plot', 'hopes', 'might', 'help', 'anyone', 'fence', 'purchase', 'movie', 'maybe', 'just', 'rent', 'Good', 'luck', 'SUMMARY', 'movie', 'historical', 'parody', 'western', 'exploration', 'United', 'States', 'territories', 'undertaken', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'early', '1800s', 'Almost', 'Heroes', 'comedic', 'rendition', 'Leslie', 'Edwards', 'respected', 'wealthy', 'society-man', 'who', 'map', 'unknown', 'United', 'States', 'beginning', 'Missouri', 'River', 'ending', 'Pacific', 'racing', 'more', 'famous', 'team', 'lead', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'Bartholomew', 'Hunt', 'Edwards', 'foil', 'character', 'fumbling', 'miscreant', 'employed', 'Edwards', 'party', 'tracker', 'journey', 'wide', 'separation', 'Hunt', 'Edwards', 'Edwards', 'finally', 'up', 'finding', 'love', 'where', 'thought', 'was', 'looking', 'glory.The', 'fellowship', 'be', 'doomed', 'start', 'when', 'audience', 'introduced', 'Edwards', 'bottom-of-the-barrel', 'frontiersmen', 'Hopes', 'Edwards', 'expedition', 'rise', 'meagerly', 'when', 'crew', 'joined', 'Shaquinna', 'who', 'presumably', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'Sacagawea', 'Shaquinna', 'young', 'Native', 'American', 'instrumental', 'party', 'mostly', 'safe', 'journey', 'west', 'mostly', 'part', 'imposed', 'crew', 'antics', 'mishaps', 'Ironically', 'Edwards', 'party', 'beats', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'Pacific', 'yet', 'interest', 'being', 'Almost', 'Heroes', 'men', 'decide', ""'d"", 'rather', 'carry', 'exploring', 'presume', ""'ve"", 'found']",Almost Heroes VHS

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[2, 2]","Almost Heroes is a crack-up comedy starring the late SNL castmember Chris Farley (Tommy Boy), Friends star Matthew Perry, Eugene Levy (American Pie), and Kevin Dunn (Stir Of Echoes).This light-hearted funfest set in 18th century America follows a group of explorers led by Leslie Edwards, played by Perry, who is attempting to discover the west before Lewis and Clark get there. Along for the journey is an obese and short tempered Bartholomew Hunt, played hysterically by Farley, a gorgeous Native princess Shaquinna, played by Lisa Barbuscia, her nasty French hubby Guy Fontenot, played by Levy, and a group of imbeciles.Almost Heroes was Chris Farley's last bang of non-stop laughter; he died only five months before the movie's theatrical release.RecommendedB",4,Farley's last bang of non-stop laughter!,1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,763,"['Almost', 'Heroes', 'crack-up', 'comedy', 'starring', 'late', 'SNL', 'castmember', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'Tommy', 'Boy', 'Friends', 'star', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'American', 'Pie', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'Stir', 'Echoes', '.This', 'light-hearted', 'funfest', 'set', '18th', 'century', 'America', 'group', 'explorers', 'led', 'Leslie', 'Edwards', 'played', 'Perry', 'who', 'attempting', 'discover', 'west', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'get', 'there', 'journey', 'obese', 'short', 'tempered', 'Bartholomew', 'Hunt', 'played', 'hysterically', 'Farley', 'gorgeous', 'Native', 'princess', 'Shaquinna', 'played', 'Lisa', 'Barbuscia', 'nasty', 'French', 'hubby', 'Guy', 'Fontenot', 'played', 'Levy', 'group', 'imbeciles.Almost', 'Heroes', 'was', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'last', 'bang', 'non-stop', 'laughter', 'died', 'only', 'five', 'months', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'release.RecommendedB']",Almost Heroes VHS

I read many of the reviews, good and bad, before buying this.  I rarely buy movies I haven't seen, bought it on the strength of the good reviews, but mostly because it was directed by the inimitable Guest, since I've yet to see a film of his I didn't love.  While the script certainly isn't stellar, Guest and company just manage to redeem it.  Good cinematography, beautiful scenery,  adept direction and camera work, with enough sustained silliness to make it worth while.  No outright hilarity, for me, but plenty of smiles and chuckles (I thought the ""ear experiment"", Matthew Perry's reaction shots (fantastic, SO silly), and the glancing encounters with rivals Lewis and Clark were the best bits in the movie).The young Perry is surprisingly good at double takes and grandiose buffoonery, the movie's glue.  He's a dandy initially WAY out of his depth, a visionary with a Johnny Depp-as-Edward D. Wood Jr.-like zeal, appeal.  Perry and Farley made a good team, plenty of chemistry there.  As others have said, the supporting players (many of my favorites) were uniformly excellent.  I really LIKED the people in this movie, especially Perry, thought they were what was best about it.  The only minor grumble I have is that a particular fave of mine, Eugene Levy, could scarcely shine in a small role as a creepy bad guy.I liked the grand, sweeping How the West Was Won-style opening, with maps of the territory, Harry Shearer's deadpan voiceover narration, and stirring music- in fact, the music throughout was just splendid (a Guest hallmark), adding to the movie's tongue-in-cheek ""authenticity"" (there's a fine line between historical fact and sheer balderdash).  It may be slight, plot & gag-wise, but it's good-natured, good-hearted, with lots of visual appeal, great music, and winsome, loony characters who obviously enjoyed what they were doing.  I enjoyed it too.And BTW, another good-natured send up (in this case, of government conspiracies, religion, and fairy tales), and a better film, actually, hilarious in spots, isTrollhunter- it's wildy inventive, inspired, I loved it.  Ditto withGalaxy Quest, a loving parody of Star Trek type TV shows.",4,"Charming, good-hearted silliness with the Guest touch",1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,2328,"['do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'be', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'fan', ""'m"", 'BIG', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'fan', 'so', 'have', 'basis', 'comparison', 're', 'Farley', 'SNL', 'thought', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'good', 'bad', 'buying', 'rarely', 'buy', 'movies', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'bought', 'strength', 'good', 'reviews', 'mostly', 'was', 'directed', 'inimitable', 'Guest', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'script', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'stellar', 'Guest', 'company', 'just', 'manage', 'redeem', 'Good', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'adept', 'direction', 'camera', 'work', 'enough', 'sustained', 'silliness', 'make', 'worth', 'outright', 'hilarity', 'plenty', 'smiles', 'chuckles', 'thought', 'ear', 'experiment', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'reaction', 'shots', 'fantastic', 'SO', 'silly', 'glancing', 'encounters', 'rivals', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'were', 'best', 'bits', 'movie', '.The', 'young', 'Perry', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'double', 'grandiose', 'buffoonery', 'movie', 'glue', 'dandy', 'initially', 'WAY', 'depth', 'visionary', 'Johnny', 'Depp-as-Edward', 'D.', 'Wood', 'Jr.-like', 'zeal', 'appeal', 'Perry', 'Farley', 'made', 'good', 'team', 'plenty', 'chemistry', 'there', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'supporting', 'players', 'many', 'favorites', 'were', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'really', 'LIKED', 'people', 'movie', 'especially', 'Perry', 'thought', 'were', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'only', 'minor', 'grumble', 'have', 'particular', 'fave', 'mine', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'could', 'scarcely', 'shine', 'small', 'role', 'creepy', 'bad', 'guy.I', 'liked', 'grand', 'sweeping', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won-style', 'opening', 'maps', 'territory', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'deadpan', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'stirring', 'music-', 'fact', 'music', 'was', 'just', 'splendid', 'Guest', 'hallmark', 'adding', 'movie', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'authenticity', 'fine', 'line', 'historical', 'fact', 'sheer', 'balderdash', 'may', 'be', 'slight', 'plot', 'gag-wise', 'good-natured', 'good-hearted', 'lots', 'visual', 'appeal', 'great', 'music', 'winsome', 'loony', 'characters', 'who', 'obviously', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'enjoyed', 'BTW', 'good-natured', 'send', 'up', 'case', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'religion', 'fairy', 'tales', 'better', 'film', 'actually', 'hilarious', 'spots', 'isTrollhunter-', 'wildy', 'inventive', 'inspired', 'loved', 'Ditto', 'withGalaxy', 'Quest', 'loving', 'parody', 'Star', 'Trek', 'type', 'TV', 'shows']",Almost Heroes VHS
