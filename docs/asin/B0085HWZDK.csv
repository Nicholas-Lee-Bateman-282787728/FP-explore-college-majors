The Led Zeppelin songs were re-arranged to the point that they were virtually unrecognizable.  &#34;Ramble On&#34; was the only song capturing the spirit of the original.  Plant's voice sounds weak and worn and his new persona is sort of an old cowboy. He hasn't aged well.  He has some talented musicians in the band, but the alt-country style really doesn't fit his voice or style.  Led Zeppelin was the zenith of his career - it's all been downhill from there.  His early solo work was far better than this.  He seems resentful that his solo work isn't getting the recognition or acclaim that his work with Zeppelin did.  His acidic comments about Page and John Paul Jones don't reflect well on him.  They have handled the situation with a lot of grace.  I didn't like his collaboration with Allison Krause (sp.?) and she's been a bad influence, musically.  Can anyone REALLY prefer Krause to early Joni Mitchell!?!?!  Plant needs to retire.  He's destroying my memories of him live, in his prime.

And a truly genius move on his part was his ""Raising Sand"" album from 2007 with Alison Krauss - a captivating mixture of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" old-timey Gospel and Country music given modern-day arrangements and a deliciously softened intimacy. Then came Part 2 of sorts in the ""Band Of Joy"" project/album from 2010.Filmed in 2011 in the gorgeous setting of the War Memorial Auditorium in Nashville in Tennessee - I mention these two CDs because in some ways ""Live At The Artist's Den"" feels like a live gig of both albums - with a few curveballs thrown in. And instead of Alison Krauss - we get Patty Griffin doing the female vocal honours - and she (like the rest of the band) absolutely rock.As for the main man - Robert Plant not only looks and sounds great on this fab BLU RAY (he can do a soft vocal caress or a rock-God scream on a dime) - it's thrilling to see that he is wholly relevant to 2012 and not just 1969. His present set list and song choices now encompass Blues, Gospel, Traditionals, Folk, Rock and World - and it all meshes into the most wonderfully uplifting sound. You can't quite nail down a genre for this but you know it's good. Throw in a truly stunning set of musicians backing him up (Buddy Miller and Darrell Scott on guitars in particular) - and Plant finally seems comfortable - glad to be on stage with these great people - even grinning with relish as he revisits rarely-heard Led Zep album tracks. Wisely too he gives solo slots to Miller, Scott and Griffin - all of whom carry the limelight with shockingly good voices and an ability to play most famous musicians under the table. The four even do an Acapella piece at the end that is more than impressive.But inevitably it's when the evening touches on stuff from Zep II like ""Ramble On"" and Zep III like ""Tangerine"" and ""Gallows Pole"" - then things just lift off into another stratosphere. Plant has re-arranged the songs so that they now sound like the unplugged feel of the ""No Quarter"" sessions but with a more rocking band and a grittier edge. The results are fantastic. There are also brilliantly reconstructed versions of ""Black Dog"" and ""Rock And Roll"" from ""Zep IV"" and a funkily cool reworking of ""Houses Of The Holy"".Released July 2012 - the picture quality (on BLU RAY) is superb - the gig intimate - and the crowd responsive. And even if you don't know the newer material - the songs are very strong melodically and played with superb feeling by musicians who have a lifetime of musical knowledge flowing through their veins. The only downsides would be that the extras are short - and the gig could have been longer. I actually wanted more - and not less.To sum up - you can't help but feel that Percy has always been smart - constantly trying to evolve himself and his knowledge of what he loves. And this superbly musical gig sees him finally arrive at a place where he's here in his future and at peace with his past. And we mere mortals can get to enjoy both.Recommended like a ""Hey Hey Mama...""",5,"""...Sing My Song...""",1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,3256,"['Forever', 'facing', 'audience', 'quite', 'literally', 'frothing', 'gash', 'hear', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'classics', 'time', 'live', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'extent', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'spent', 'years', 'distancing', 'establish', 'solo', 'identity', 'truly', 'genius', 'move', 'part', 'was', 'Raising', 'Sand', 'album', '2007', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'captivating', 'mixture', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'old-timey', 'Gospel', 'Country', 'music', 'given', 'modern-day', 'arrangements', 'deliciously', 'softened', 'intimacy', 'Then', 'came', 'Part', '2', 'sorts', 'Band', 'Joy', 'project/album', '2010.Filmed', '2011', 'gorgeous', 'setting', 'War', 'Memorial', 'Auditorium', 'Nashville', 'Tennessee', 'mention', 'two', 'CDs', 'ways', 'Live', 'Artist', 'Den', 'feels', 'live', 'gig', 'albums', 'few', 'curveballs', 'thrown', 'instead', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'get', 'Patty', 'Griffin', 'doing', 'female', 'vocal', 'honours', 'rest', 'band', 'absolutely', 'rock.As', 'main', 'man', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'fab', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'can', 'do', 'soft', 'vocal', 'caress', 'rock-God', 'scream', 'dime', 'thrilling', 'see', 'wholly', 'relevant', '2012', 'not', 'just', '1969', 'present', 'set', 'list', 'song', 'choices', 'now', 'encompass', 'Blues', 'Gospel', 'Traditionals', 'Folk', 'Rock', 'World', 'meshes', 'most', 'wonderfully', 'uplifting', 'sound', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'nail', 'down', 'genre', 'know', 'good', 'Throw', 'truly', 'stunning', 'set', 'musicians', 'backing', 'up', 'Buddy', 'Miller', 'Darrell', 'Scott', 'guitars', 'particular', 'Plant', 'finally', 'comfortable', 'glad', 'be', 'stage', 'great', 'people', 'even', 'grinning', 'relish', 'rarely-heard', 'Led', 'Zep', 'album', 'tracks', 'Wisely', 'too', 'solo', 'slots', 'Miller', 'Scott', 'Griffin', 'whom', 'carry', 'limelight', 'shockingly', 'good', 'voices', 'ability', 'play', 'most', 'famous', 'musicians', 'table', 'four', 'even', 'do', 'Acapella', 'piece', 'end', 'more', 'impressive.But', 'inevitably', 'when', 'evening', 'touches', 'stuff', 'Zep', 'II', 'Ramble', 'Zep', 'III', 'Tangerine', 'Gallows', 'Pole', 'then', 'things', 'just', 'lift', 'off', 'stratosphere', 'Plant', 're-arranged', 'songs', 'now', 'sound', 'unplugged', 'feel', 'Quarter', 'sessions', 'more', 'rocking', 'band', 'grittier', 'edge', 'results', 'are', 'fantastic', 'are', 'also', 'brilliantly', 'reconstructed', 'versions', 'Black', 'Dog', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Zep', 'IV', 'funkily', 'cool', 'reworking', 'Houses', 'Holy', '.Released', 'July', '2012', 'picture', 'quality', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'superb', 'gig', 'intimate', 'crowd', 'responsive', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'newer', 'material', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'melodically', 'played', 'superb', 'feeling', 'musicians', 'who', 'have', 'lifetime', 'musical', 'knowledge', 'flowing', 'veins', 'only', 'downsides', 'would', 'be', 'extras', 'are', 'short', 'gig', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'actually', 'wanted', 'more', 'not', 'less.To', 'sum', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'Percy', 'always', 'been', 'smart', 'constantly', 'trying', 'evolve', 'knowledge', 'what', 'superbly', 'musical', 'gig', 'finally', 'arrive', 'place', 'where', 'here', 'future', 'peace', 'past', 'mere', 'mortals', 'can', 'get', 'enjoy', 'both.Recommended', 'Hey', 'Hey', 'Mama']",N/A
1546775,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0085HWZDK,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","After former Led Zeppelin front man Plant ended a brief but successful pairing with bluegrass star Alison Krauss he formed this Band of Joy named after an early pre-Zep collaboration from the 1960's.  This time he includes several heavyweights into the mix including singer/guitarist/songwriter Patty Griffin, guitarist/singer and producer extraordinaire Buddy Miller, singer and player of anything with strings Darrell Scott, bassist Byron House and drummer/percussionist Marco Giovino.This band is like a perfect cocktail.  One part country, one part blues, one part gospel, one part soul and fill the glass with rock `n roll.  Plant still has what it takes but he no longer screeches and screams.  His musical taste is perfecto with 6 or 7 Led Zep songs (out of 16) that sound brand new given the great arrangements.  Each band member is given a chance to shine and they all do.  Pay special attention to Miller when he gets a guitar solo (often).  He's as good as anybody in the business.This concert was filmed in Nashville at the War Memorial Auditorium by the TV program ""Live from the Artist Den."" The disc includes a brief tribute to the venue and very brief interviews between some of the songs.  The concert itself is a too brief 77 minutes and features a PCM Stereo or DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  I saw this group when they first got together a couple years ago.
