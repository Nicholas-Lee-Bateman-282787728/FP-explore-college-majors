697956,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0000640VK,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 15]","Are you a cereal eater?  I find that I enjoy a cool bowl of Honey Bunches of Oats in the morning to best get my sleepy engine running.  What I enjoy are the clusters of wholesome oats and honey that really do a wonder on my taste sensations.  I like these clusters because, while they may be all different sizes, they are consistent with the rest of the cereal.  These clusters do not stand out, or work as a solo meal, but instead work with the rest of the bowl to give me an overall great breakfast experience.  If a person were to ask me about a way that The Shipping News could have been a better film, I believe I would have answered with the Honey Bunches of Oats analogy above.  This film was full of nothing but character clusters that unfortunately could not work with the rest of the film.  We had cluster after cluster of events taking place, raging from childhood rape to a wife's decision to spread false information all the way to a false autopsy (hopefully not giving too much away), but instead of making this a powerful film about human suffering, we are left with an unforgivable amount of lacking substance with each character, thus creating a horrid film which leaves you nothing to fully sink you teeth into.Director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m has directed some great films like Cider House Rules as well as Chocolat, but The Shipping News will not be as successful as these films because of Hallstr&ouml;m's lack of grip on the main subjects.  He begins this film by focusing intently on Quoyle (Spacey) painting us a bold and vivid portrait of his past and leering present, but once we get this story in motion, Hallstr&ouml;m quickens his pace and drops Quoyle to the backburner as we attempt to create a town of mishaps.  Everyone is depressed, everyone has seen harder days, and everyone is jaded in this film because Hallstr&ouml;m wants to demonstrate a village that sees the same problems that Quoyle does.  For me, this didn't work.  Instead of making the film as depressing as the scenery, perhaps he could have created a town a bit more realistic (maybe a bit more Capra-esque - although I didn't like it in Darabont's Majestic) which would allow the minimal characters to shine without the need to bring darkness into every story.  What could have made this film stand out would be the smaller, more supportive character being funny, cute, or even a bit optimistic.  Early in the film I accepted Quoyle for was who he was due to his life struggles, but I needed Hallstr&ouml;m to give me a strong juxtaposition between where Quoyle was in Poughkeepsie to where he moved to in Newfoundland.  I know he seemed like he was getting a better life, but to me Hallstr&ouml;m seemed to force it and make the transition tired and without emotion.  With the strength of the secondary characters, we could have seen a stronger transition for Quoyle in this new, yet familiar, home.  The fact that everyone in town harbored some dark, nearly horrific story just felt cheap because we, as an audience, were forced to spread our sympathies thin, not sure whom to give it the strongest attention.  In my eyes, the biggest error in Hallstr&ouml;m's adaptation of this Pulitzer Prize winner was the lack of the environment, both living as well as scenic, surrounded Quoyle.Typically Hallstr&ouml;m has the ability to pull great work out of even the least favorite actor.  I saw this with Toby Maguire in Cider House Rules, but alas, with this film it felt like everyone was just trying to stay warm so they swooped through their lines devoid of anything worth mentioning.  Spacey doldrums his way through his character Quoyle, giving us yet another Pay It Forward spineless performance.  Ebert said that ""Spacey plays smart characters well"", and I couldn't agree with him more.  It just seems like lately Spacey has been afraid of those types and opts to rather play soft troubled characters where he never has to raise his voice.  Julianne Moore was forgetful in this film.  She has one type of character that she plays, and whether you watch this movie or Evolution or Magnolia, you typically see the same character just with a different name.  While I have enjoyed some of her performances in the past, it seems as if as I watch her going forward, she seems to blend everything together.  Her performance in this film reminded me of her performance in The Forgotten, but with a different accent.  Dame Judi Dench only plays roles like this one, so it should be no surprise that she chose to participate in this film.  Her character is confusing, which leads me to believe that Hallstr&ouml;m didn't know quite to do with the power that Dench had to offer.  The only actor that I believed did something spectacular in this film was Cate Blanchett.  Her few moments on screen as Petal, also as the main catalyst for Quoyle, was breathtakingly refreshing.  She was smart, sharp, and passionately not herself, who made for a character this critic wishes we saw more of during this sloppy film.  Again, the clusters of characters in this film were never working together to defeat a common purpose, but merely being themselves, giving us no energy, and providing us with a film severely lacking in all core elements of cinema.Overall, The Shipping News was a bust for Spacey fans, it was a bust for Hallstr&ouml;m fans, and it was a bust for E. Annie Proulx's fans.  I will always be the first to say that it is difficult work to recreate the inner-human from the written page, because a director could never physically put a character/actor in a place where the characters within the book are, it is mentally and physically impossible.  There are some books that actually are translated well onto screen, but for this film, it did not happen.  I blame the director in this case for thinking that because the scenery was horrid, the characters would need to be as well.  I also place blame on the actors for not giving us enough dedication to their characters.  If you are looking for a book that would accompany this film just as well, check out Iain Banks' ""The Wasp Factory"".  It is one of those books that could never translate well into a film, but is just as depressing as this film is!Grade: ** out of *****",2,"You don't have the sense God gave a donut, do

The standard of acting, directing and cinematography is all very high, with good performances from Spacey, Julianne Moore, Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench (though seeing Dench pop up in 50% of all films is becoming somewhat tedious).The problem with this film is its script. The plot is sentimental, predictable drivel, starting well casting Spacey as the heartbreaking loner, but resolving his problems in such a &quot;...and they all lived happily ever after&quot; fashion that it is impossible to feel uplifted by his transformation. Everything falls into place for him in predictably easy, unrealistic fashion. Admittedly, one or two plot twists are added to spice things up, but the majority of the script is too predictable for any amount of good acting, cinematography or directing to lift. 3 stars.",3,"Good acting, poor script",1039132800,"12 6, 2002",2002,934,"['Having', 'heard', 'lots', 'good', 'things', 'Shipping', 'News', 'being', 'moderate', 'fan', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'decided', 'rent', 'video', 'standard', 'acting', 'directing', 'cinematography', 'very', 'high', 'good', 'performances', 'Spacey', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'seeing', 'Dench', 'pop', 'up', '50', '%', 'films', 'becoming', 'somewhat', 'tedious', '.The', 'problem', 'film', 'script', 'plot', 'sentimental', 'predictable', 'drivel', 'starting', 'well', 'casting', 'Spacey', 'heartbreaking', 'loner', 'resolving', 'problems', 'quot', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'quot', 'fashion', 'impossible', 'feel', 'uplifted', 'transformation', 'Everything', 'place', 'predictably', 'easy', 'unrealistic', 'fashion', 'Admittedly', 'one', 'two', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'added', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'majority', 'script', 'too', 'predictable', 'amount', 'good', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'directing', 'lift', '3', 'stars']",The Shipping News

697959,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B0000640VK,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[27, 28]","Rarely does a movie adhere to a book's story as well as Shipping News does to Annie Proulx' sparkling literary masterpiece, a novel about time, place, traditions and love.The big lump of a main character, Quoyle, a sad, pathetic man (Kevin Spacey) is defined by a metaphor deftly recreated in this film: He cannot swim. As the movie opens, we find that he cannot do much of anything else either.The inksetter for a Poughkeepsie newspaper drives into a gas station in the pouring rain and witnesses a lovers' quarrel between the driver and passenger in the first car. He doesn't get gas. A split-second courtship instigated by Petal (Cate Blanchett) saddles Quoyle with a disastrous marriage--and his child, Bunny--and ends more disastrously than it began. But Quoyle, lump that he is, unwinds after Petal leaves the picture and his parents die.Quoyle's Aunt Agnes arrives, ostensibly to pay her respects, but with a caper in mind. Our befuddled man Quoyle leaves with her for his family's dilapidated homestead on Newfoundland's Quoyle point. The house, tied down with steel stays, appears like the ruin of Quoyle's life, and as the story unfolds it becomes clear that the sense of ruin plaguing him may be familial.But Quoyle surprises viewers and himself as he reclaims his life. Hired to cover car accidents, he earns the respect of the paper's cranky fisherman owner, Jack Buggit, who shocks the staff when he assigns Quoyle a weekly column on the shipping news. Quoyle has no experience, but he his new friends teach him to think in headlines, providing welcome comic relief.Like parents everywhere, Quoyle finds a friend in another parent, Wavey (Julianne Moore). The friendship takes several interesting turns.Quoyle is haunted by flashbacks of his own life, and to events that occurred before he was born. The film's triumph, like that of Proulx' book, is in Quoyle's steadfast determination to overcome these seemingly insurmountable odds. The film's Newfoundland (like that in the book) appears dead. But as Quoyle lays the past to rest, both he and the town come to life.Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m aptly directed this film, whose score provides delight on a par with Quoyle's Shipping News headlines.

She continues the abuse but also provides him with a daughter, Bunny.His father's exit from this world is announced to him in the most causual of ways, which starts a snowball of tragedies just as an unknown aunt (Judy Densch) appears on his doorstep.LIFE IN NEWFOUNDLANDIt is clear that life feels too much for R. G. Coyle.  It all happens to him.  He grudgingly accepts the suggestion of his long lost aunt to return to his family's former homeland.  His last name opens some doors for him and his peculiar new life is begun.His new home is in northern Canada, where fishing and shipping is the lifeblood of the town.  His name carries weight, but he is surprised at its significance.  Everyone seems to know more than him.  Secrets abound, even within his own family.A town widow befriends him, and their relationship develops but not without its troubles.Not a lot changes but what does change,  changes for everyone.  This would have been easier to follow as a book as each person's life from his employer and his son, his co-workers, his aunt, the widow and her son and his daughter's lives are all intricated weaved and changing with time.

697962,A1R602SXNGOMJ4,B0000640VK,A. Vegan,"[3, 5]","The Shipping News is the story of Quoyle, (Spacey) a man who has been used and abused all of his life. Circumstances occur that leave him alone in the world with a 6 year old daughter to care for, until a long lost aunt (Dench) he has never known shows up at his door. He and his daughter follow her on her journey to their ancestral home in Newfoundland where he attempts to better his life and the life of his daughter, and battle with the demons in both his own past and that of his ancestors.This had all the right ingredients for being a good film. An interesting story, some great actors and an acclaimed and experienced director, but somehow nothing seems to work. I was expecting a steady thoughtful film but so much takes place in the first few minutes that you just can't believe what's happening. Things slow down once we get to Newfoundland but it doesn't really get much better.

Given the fact that doing so requires Spacey to abandon his usual self-confident demeanor and ostentatious panache in favor of a more confused and self-tortured inaction and doubt, this is a meaningful departure from his previous work. Yet he does so with more than enough skill, tact, and craftsmanship to make the central character quite believable. This is critically important, as this film is really a character study of the Spacey character and of his tortured efforts to try to find a way out of the box life has placed him in, to try to rediscover himself.The supporting cast is memorable, as well, with the lovely Julianne Moore providing a comely yet intriguingly flawed love interest sufficient to both interest and attract this cold fish up a bit. Also, Dame Judy Dench is absolutely superb playing his curmudgeonly old aunt, a woman substantial enough to literally drag Quoyle back to his remote ancestral digs in coastal Newfoundland to help him search for his place in the family pantheon. Scott Glenn is also very good as a local newspaper publisher who sees potential in Quoyle and thus lures him into his world, as does the lovely Cate Blanchett, who promptly seduces Quoyle into a little lesson in love and regret.I really like this film as it takes the time and energy required to turn an off-beat character study into a memorable story, one we can all relate to, and one full of the pathos and pity that life is too often writ with. It is not a particularly fast-paced movie, and those looking for a quick pace or a lot of action best look elsewhere. But if you want to take some time to spend in looking deliberately and provocatively at many facets that make up a complex and evolving human being, this movie won't steer you wrong.

Much of the background detail about the characters' lives was such an integral part of the story that leaving it out made me feel like behind-the-scenes developments were being concealed from the audience. And then it just....ended--very awkwardly, with no conclusion. I am just wondering if maybe some books are too emotionally complex to be made into a movie.As another reviewer said, the director just touched on so many things without any detail about them. I think this movie would have been wonderful if it had been longer. And with such a great cast, I think that audiences would have appreciated it.I also thought that Kevin Spacey was terribly miscast as Quoyle - his looks just did not fit at all. What could the casting director have been thinking? And although I usually love his acting, in this film it seemed that he played Quoyle, at times, as dimwitted/mentally challenged, soft and cuddly, not at all like the Quoyle of the book.Almost all of the characters in the movie were quirky and odd, but I do not remember getting that same sense from the book. Different, yes. And some were odd. But not all. It was as though in the movie, only certain characteristics were revealed, leaving anything vaguely normal about the characters on the pages of the book or on the cutting room floor.The scenery was magnificent and its grimness and wild beauty reflected the inner struggles and remoteness of the characters. The cinematography alone made the movie worth watching.

One wouldn't think so, but Lasse Halsstrom (director) does so with stunning clarity.The film is about Quoyle (Kevin Spacey), a man broken apart by an unsatisfying marriage to a [witch] (played excellently by Cate Blanchett).  Before the marriage ends, they have a child, Bunny -- who is the highlight of her father's life -- and the mother is killed in a car accident. Coincidentally, Quoyle's ""mother"" and father were killed very recently, too.Enter Agnes Quoyle (Judi Dench), Quoyle's ""aunt"" who's heard about the death of her ""nephews"" parents and is there when news of the death of Bunny's mother arrives.  It is clear from the outset that Agnes doesn't want to hang around, but feels compelled to when she sees her ""nephew"" fall apart in front of his daughter.  She recommends that he and his child come with her to Newfoundland, to discover a new life for themselves....The trouble is, is that their old life also awaits them in Newfoundland.  Agnes is not -- exactly -- as she appears to be, nor is Quoyle's family.  Quoyle soon discovers his family lineage: Piracy and wickedness.  And he soon finds a new love interest who is just as broken as he is (Julianne Moore).A curse on their native house in Newfoundland, ghosts, a sixth-sense that some natives have (that comes alive in Quoyle's daughter, too, as the days slip past), homosexuality, incest, murder, family bonds, and a beautifully austere landscape round out much of the story.

It is the quietly moving story of a decent, shy man whose only experience with love was heartbreakingly one-sided.Kevin Spacey plays Quoyle to understated perfection in ""Chocolat"" director Lasse Hallstrom's deeply emotional film based on Annie Proulx's Pulitzer Prize winning novel. Quoyle's silence and simple words tell us volumes about the pain and turmoil going on inside him. Having married the only girl who ever really noticed him (Cate Blanchett) his only experience with love is associated with pain and ridicule.When she deserts him and is killed in a car accident, he is left alone with his young daughter, and a heart full of grief and anguish. In an attempt to start over somehow he travels with his aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) to New Foundland, where his family has a long and not so sterling history going back generations. The dark and beautiful New Foundland coast has withstood the harsh winds over time and seems the perfect place for Quoyle to start his life over.He is offered a job writing for the local paper and slowly gains some measure of self-respect. Quoyle certainly notices beautiful Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore) on the trip over sea but cannot articulate his slowly growing attraction to her, and is relegated to friendship status only. She has some secrets of her own, however, which emotionally paralyze her beyond the sphere of her very special son. But when she warms to the kind and decent man inside Quoyle, it is he who has trouble responding, the damage done to his heart by Petal (Blanchett) overwhelming.There is something magical about this film. There are colorful characters and mysteries unfolding about Quoyle's ancestors. And his young daughter hears the house once pulled up the hill by his clan speaking to her. Spacey's Quoyle must discover if you can love and be loved in return without pain. Both Spacey and Moore are wonderful here as they desperately try to overcome their damaged hearts and love once more.The Shipping News is a slowly unfolding and richly rewarding film which stays in your heart after the final credits.

However, Hallstr&ouml;m has continued to make serious, artistic films in the ensuing years and I, for one, am grateful.  I've never seen a film of his that didn't totally engross me and this one is no exception.  I tried reading the novel upon which this is based and I put it down time and time again.  Finally, I gave up on it as too literary.  So I was very happy that I could watch the movie straight through without any hangups from its source Pulitzer prize winning novel.  Kevin Spacey is the main character and we follow his life from being a nerd in New York with a wife (Cate Blanchett) who is gorgeous but a real low life.  When she dies in a car wreck, his aunt (Judi Densch) talks him into moving to Newfoundland with her and his daughter to reinvent his life.  He does so as a newspaper reporter there.  There is also a lot of magical realism and mysticism going on in this movie, which I found very absorbing, plus humor.  Scott Glenn plays one of his best roles ever as the irascible newspaper owner, Jack, and he provides great comic relief for the film. Every actor in this film gives an A performance.  It is a dream cast and I can't imagine casting it differently.  If you are not already a fan of Hallstr&ouml;m's work, you should be.

697980,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B0000640VK,Daddy,"[0, 0]","This is yet another beautiful  film from the genius of Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m.  Kevin Spacey plays Quoyle (only called by his last name), a mediocre man who seems lost in his own life, and he's mostly clueless about everything else.  Cate Blanchett plays Petal, a trashy slut who uses Quoyle for her needs, but doesn't care about anything else.  Judi Dench plays Agnis Hamm, a relative of Quoyle's from Newfoundland.  Julianne Moore plays Wavey Prowse, a single mother with a mentally challenged child, living in Newfoundland.  Pete Postlethwaite plays Tert Card, a gruff and cynical newspaper editor.  Scott Glenn plays Jack Buggit, a no-nonsense newspaper owner who takes Quoyle under his wing.  There are stories within stories in this film.  But, I'll just lay out the basic summary for simplicity's sake... Quoyle (Spacey) meanders through life until he meets Petal (Blanchett), and has a one-night stand with her which leaves her pregnant, so he falls in love with her and moves her into his life.  But, she's a slut who only cares about herself.  She has his child, a daughter, then years go by, and somehow they're still together, though Quoyle does most of the child rearing.  Then, Petal gets killed in a car wreck (along with a guy with whom she was cheating on Quoyle).  Then, Agnis (Dench) comes to take Quoyle and his daughter back to Newfoundland (Quoyle's ancestral home), where he can find his way in life by facing his heritage.  Quoyle goes back to Newfoundland, takes up residence in an old house which belongs to his ancestors, then takes a job at the local newspaper as a reporter of the shipping news (the town is a fishing town, and everyone has a boat).  Gradually, Quoyle faces his demons, confronts his past, and becomes a better man, while also finding a new love with Wavey (Moore), a local single mother with a past of her own to face.  There's far more to the story than that.  But, you must watch the movie to get the full picture.  Kevin Spacey is adequate, but rather zombie-ish in his potrayal.  Judi Dench and Julianne Moore are marvelous, always so talented in their portrayals.  Scott Glenn is terrific in his role.  And Pete Posthelwaitte is also great in his role, despite his unlikeable character.  This is not a perfect movie, but it is a moving and interesting story, well filmed and scripted.

One is reminded of Thomas Hobbes' famous aphorism that men often are doomed to endure lives of quiet desperation.  He falls in love with Petal Bear (Cate Blanchett) only hours after they meet who does nothing to hide her manipulative dark side.  They have a daughter Bunny and this selfish woman proves totally lacking in compassion and loyalty to the both of them.  The movie industry has rarely put on the screen a more despicable mother in its entire history.  It is regretful that Blanchett will not likely receive an Academy Award nomination for her too short time in this film.The very promiscuous Petal Bear is ultimately found dead in a car accident with a new boy friend.  Quoyle's Aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) entices him and Bunny to move back to their ancestral home located in Newfoundland.  This is a part of Canada that the tourists make sure they don't visit.  Summertime in May is dreary and the life of the locals indeed echoes the previously cited Hobbes as awful, brutish, and short.  Death seems to constantly be lurking in the water and on the treacherously icy roads.  People do not aspire to financial affluence, but a life that is barely one step ahead of grinding poverty.  The publisher of &quot; The Shipping News&quot; Jack Buggit (admirably performed by Scott Glenn) offers Quoyle a job as a reporter, a position that our protagonist appears totally unqualified to handle.  Lo and behold, however, Quoyle admirably grows into his new employment responsibilities and begins the process of evolving into a man of respect and dignity.  A mother with a mentally impaired young son drifts into Quoyle's life.  Julianne More portrays Wavey in a manner lacking authenticity.  Never for a moment does she come across as a woman whose only option is to remain in such an abysmally hopeless environment.Quoyle eventually finds out that it sometimes might not be best to learn about the past.  His family tree is filled with dysfunctional and evil members.  Nonetheless,  these scenes of Quoyle finding his roots make the film worth while.  I have not read the novel &quot;The Shipping News&quot; is based upon.  Therefore, I can only speak about what is actually on the screen.  This film doesn't deserve a five star rating, but it's sufficiently good that I recommend all Kevin Spacey fans make a point of seeing it.

He played a drug dealing, jet-setting, psycho that went around killing people, freaking out and saying things like ""only the toes knows..."".  Well, if the toes knew, they must have know what a big star Spacey would be in just a few years.  He choses films that stretch his untouchable range in the Usual Suspects, the serial killer in 7, the gentle soul claiming to be an alien in the wonderfully moving K-Pax to this gem of a film The Shipping News.  This was a gentle, loving, heart-lifting book, so I feared when it came to the screen, all the quirkiness that made it so special might be lost.  Instead, it is beautiful realised under Spacey brilliant performance, backed by the ever eternal and radiant Juliana Moore and the utterly marvellous Judy Dench and the solid Pete Postlethwaite, and another super tour de force for the ever solid Scott Glen.This is a story that touches your heart, the way so many of Hollywood films fail to do, and leave you smiling at the end, and maybe even leaves you missing these near friends you have come to love.  It is good to see films like that do so well, just a shame there is not more.It is brilliantly written, with all the quirkiness you find in a small knit community, the isolation tend to make the locals revel in their bizarre personalities and even sort of wear them like a badge.  I have seen this same 'wee tight isle' in Scotland and in Ireland and small towns in the US.  Everyone knows everyone - knows the history as far back as it goes.  The past is not so distant, where people with the sight is just an everyday occurrence.Kevin Spacey plays a gentle soul, driven by an overbearing, likely abusive father to believing he was nothing.  He felt the world pasted him by until Petal jumped into his car.  Petal is typical Hussy type, a lass out for fun and little else.  For the first time, Kevin's character feels that he no invisible.  Petal gets pregnant, have a baby girl, Bunny, and then precedes to live life just as she always had, with good time guys and honky-tonks.  She checks in long enough to upset Spacey, and pat the kid on the head.  When the child is about 8, she slips away with child in tow, running away with the latest boyfriend.  If that is not upsetting enough, Spacey's father and mother decided life is the pits and check out.In the midst of finding out Petal died in a car crash with her boyfriend, but sold Bunny to a black-market child adoption ring for six thousand dollars, Spacey's long lost aunt,(Dench) turns up to steal her brothers ashes.  (Won't reveal what she does with them!!  She encourages Spacey to take his daughter and move back to New Foundland to where his family comes from.  Once there his daughter shows tendencies of 'the sight' but it is taken in stride.Scott Glen owns the local paper and hired Spacey to write the shipping news.  He fears failure in this, since Petal just reinforced his worthlessness instilled by his father.  However, instead, he comes into his own.  He also begins a tentative romance with Moore, with his daughter taking to her son, who suffered brain damage during birth.Spacey faces his demons and learns to heal, as Dench confronts her own secrets and shames, and loves to move on.The scenery is gorgeous, raining and foggy ( sorry I am a Scot and love a bit of the wet and fog makes me want to walk in it forever.  This captures the moodiness, though the snow in May does make one shudder!)This is just one beautiful movie.

Litton,"[8, 9]","""If a piece of knotted rope can unleash the wind, and a dead man can wake up, then I believe that a broken man can heal.""The lesson it takes Quoyle, the central character of ""The Shipping News,"" almost a lifetime to learn. Of course we, as an audience, can already pinpoint the film's moral message, given the fact that this is a character-based meller with plenty of saccharine sentiment and gorgeous cinematography. The surprise here is the director, Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, instills the film with enough interest to keep it afloat, with a little help from his cast along the way.The film stars Kevin Spacey against type as Quoyle, a boy whose life has been shaped by the years of physical and emotional torment at the hands of his father. Life as Quoyle experiences it is simple and colorless, until he crosses paths with Petal (Cate Blanchett), a drifter who happens into his life one day and becomes his everything. This woman is a class act: she stays out late while a despondent Quoyle remains home with their daughter, Bunny, all the while pleading with Petal to give their marriage another try.One momentous day, Quoyle receives word of his father's death, and returns home from the funeral to find Petal and Bunny gone from his life. Enter Agnis Hamm (Judi Dench), his aunt from his father's side who has stopped by to pay her respects on her way back to Newfoundland, where their family's ancestry lies. After news of Petal's death and the return of Bunny, Quoyle makes the decision to travel to Newfoundland with Agnis in hopes of regaining some semblance of order in life once again.Once the story makes the transition to the coldly atmospheric coast of Newfoundland, more characters are introduced, more of Quoyle's family history is revealed, much to the silent dismay of Agnis, who would rather keep the wrongdoings of her family hidden from view. Quoyle attain a job at the local newspaper, makes good with editor Jack Buggit (Scott Glenn), who takes a liking to the fact that his work stirs up interest in the town; later, he awards Quoyle his own weekly column. As Quoyle makes his rounds, he meets interesting faces, and takes a liking to the local daycare operator, Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore), a conserved woman with a young boy who suffers from minor mental defects.The movie has two main things going for it: its cast and its wonderfully dense appearance. As Quoyle, Spacey is required to express emotion through words and facial expression, and achieves both very convincingly despite the lack of development of his character. Dench does well in portraying Agnis as reserved and quiet, while Moore shows a great deal of warmth and emotion; both actresses succeed in keeping us mystified by their characters' pasts, making the revelations more impacting and heartfelt. Various actors, including Glenn, Jason Behr, Pete Postlethwaite and more, play the local townsfolk very well; also worth mentioning is the short-lived but effectively chilling performance from Blanchett, who proves her versatility as an actress in portraying Petal as one of the lowest forms of life.The look of ""The Shipping News"" is nothing short of breathtaking, containing its fair share of beautiful vistas that evoke the grandeur and beauty of Newfoundland. Seeing this film's setting unfold reminded me of such films as ""The Horse Whisperer"" and ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" where the setting plays a role in the film. Here, the same type of approach is applied, and succeeds for the most part in grabbing our attention in between character development.So what's the purpose of it all? Well, as far as I can tell, it's a coming-to-grips story in which people realize their fears and their hidden secrets and make peace with their inner torments. However, it seems that everyone but the intended character achieves this: both Agnis and Wavey face a part of their past they have long since ignored, while Buggit, after a near-death experience, reconciles with his son. Even little Bunny accepts her mother's death, but Quoyle himself spends more time helping these people deal with their emotional grief rather than devoting time to dealing with his own. One might gather that through helping those around him, Quoyle is making his own realization, which comes at the movie's weirdly cut-off ending.Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't. One could argue that the lack of developing his character does not merit this deduction about his coming-to-grips with life. Even still, Hallstr&ouml;m keeps all of this moving at a pace where no one in the audience is required to put much thought into what they see, providing us a movie where one can simply relax and enjoy the experience. This is somewhat similar of one of his previous films, ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" which derived its complexity through its simplistic approach. And while ""The Shipping News"" may not be as complex as some of Hallstr&ouml;m's previous efforts, his many artistic touches are felt throughout much of this acceptably melodramatic landscape of self-realization.",4,Hallstr&ouml;m's direction is felt throughout.,1011657600,"01 22, 2002",2002,5028,"['piece', 'knotted', 'rope', 'can', 'unleash', 'wind', 'dead', 'man', 'can', 'wake', 'up',

697989,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0000640VK,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE SHIPPING NEWS (2001, 113 minutes) is a delightful, hardline metaphysical meditation about life's ways of beating down a person. Though our hero, New Yorker Quoyle (no first name for Kevin Spacey in this truly magnificent role) can't really determine whether he's a man or a mouse, he often wonders if he's truly either. In fact, as he states at the beginning, he wonders whether his parents adopted him and all he's really missing is his people. His father causes all this by nearly drowning the young Quoyle in an effort to teach him to swim (and I recognize this because it was done to me at the same age).Quoyle encounters and marries the obnoxious pig Petal (a stunning turn by a nearly unrecognizable Cate Blanchett) who at least gives him a precious daughter, Bunny (a precociously talented Alyssa Gainer) before leaving him some years later. On the eve when Quoyle is struggling with the urns containing the ashes of his parents - who committed suicide due to illness - he is visited by his aunt Agnes Hamm (an eye-popping portrayal by Dame Judi Dench). She stops to see him on her way back home ... to Newfoundland.She is also after something else, but I will not spoil any more.After a few days it is decided they will all return to Newfoundland together. Aunt Agnes - who calls Quoyle ""nephew"" thus robbing us of learning his first name - says they should live where their people came from, and she has decided to return there also. The film does not clarify where she's been, but we will learn why she's been gone from home. We also learn all about the Quoyle Clan and their Newfoundland history in a most compelling way. I have never seen a film so rich in the history of a family and a people, as opposed to concentrating on the place.I just love this film - but it has rough spots that may be too tough on children.Filmed on location in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, I found myself doing some light reading about the people of Newfoundland for this review. I kept away from reviewing this film for years because some treats I like to sort of keep to myself for a long while. But I learned that Newfoundland, along with Labrador, is among the top 10 friendliest places on earth. Also I learned that it would be impossible to tell if the Irish-cum-Midlands-English accent of the people is genuine: Newfoundland is home to more weird English accents than anywhere in the world. I thought the U.S. held that distinction. My research did confirm that the film, at least, is as genuine as film can get.The people of the area thus tend to be eclectic and welcoming; they count proudly among their ancestry the English, Irish, Scots, French and Indians (whom they call ""Aboriginal""). This is a visually breathtaking film, with a hearty soup of cultural flavor I never thought anyone would make about Newfoundland - and that is one reason I did some light research. To return to one's proper home, and be with one's own, well, that is a lesson you will either learn or relearn through Quoyle's eyes in this film.This treasure features the fantastic talents of Pete Postlethwaite, Rhys Ifans, Scott Glenn, Julianne Moore, Gordon Pinsent, the gorgeous Jason Behr, and the wonderful Gainer sisters - Alyssa, Kaitlyn and Lauren - in the role of the psychically gifted Bunny at several different ages.",5,The way for a mouse to become a man,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,3305,"['SHIPPING', 'NEWS', '2001', '113', 'minutes', 'delightful', 'hardline', 'metaphysical', 'meditation', 'life', 'ways', 'beating', 'down', 'person', 'hero', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Quoyle', 'first', 'name', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'role', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'determine', 'man', 'mouse', 'often', 'truly', 'fact', 'beginning', 'parents', 'adopted', 'really', 'missing', 'people', 'father', 'nearly', 'drowning', 'young', 'Quoyle', 'effort', 'teach', 'swim', 'recognize', 'was', 'done', 'same', 'age', 'encounters', 'obnoxious', 'pig', 'Petal', 'stunning', 'turn', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'least', 'precious', 'daughter', 'Bunny', 'precociously', 'talented', 'Alyssa', 'Gainer', 'leaving', 'years', 'later', 'eve', 'when', 'Quoyle', 'struggling', 'urns', 'containing', 'ashes', 'parents', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'due', 'illness', 'visited', 'aunt', 'Agnes', 'Hamm', 'eye-popping', 'portrayal', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'see', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'Newfoundland.She', 'also', 'something', 'else', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'more.After', 'few', 'days', 'decided', 'will', 'return', 'Newfoundland', 'together', 'Aunt', 'Agnes', 'who', 'Quoyle', 'nephew', 'thus', 'robbing', 'learning', 'first', 'name', 'should', 'live', 'where', 'people', 'came', 'decided', 'return', 'there', 'also', 'film', 'not', 'clarify', 'where', 'been', 'will', 'learn', 'why', 'been', 'gone', 'home', 'also', 'learn', 'Quoyle', 'Clan', 'Newfoundland', 'history', 'most', 'compelling', 'way', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'rich', 'history', 'family', 'people', 'opposed', 'concentrating', 'place.I', 'just', 'love', 'film', 'rough', 'spots', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'tough', 'children.Filmed', 'location', 'Newfoundland', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'found', 'doing', 'light', 'reading', 'people', 'Newfoundland', 'review', 'kept', 'away', 'reviewing', 'film', 'years', 'treats', 'like', 'sort', 'keep', 'myself', 'long', 'while', 'learned', 'Newfoundland', 'Labrador', 'top', '10', 'friendliest', 'places', 'earth', 'Also', 'learned', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'tell', 'Irish-cum-Midlands-English', 'accent', 'people', 'genuine', 'Newfoundland', 'home', 'more', 'weird', 'English', 'accents', 'anywhere', 'world', 'thought', 'U.S.', 'held', 'distinction', 'research', 'did', 'confirm', 'film', 'least', 'as', 'genuine', 'film', 'can', 'get.The', 'people', 'area', 'thus', 'tend', 'be', 'eclectic', 'welcoming', 'count', 'proudly', 'ancestry', 'English', 'Irish', 'Scots', 'French', 'Indians', 'whom', 'call', 'Aboriginal', 'visually', 'breathtaking', 'film', 'hearty', 'soup', 'cultural', 'flavor', 'never', 'thought', 'anyone', 'would', 'make', 'Newfoundland', 'one', 'reason', 'did', 'light', 'research', 'return', 'one', 'proper', 'home', 'be', 'one', 'own', 'well', 'lesson', 'will', 'either', 'learn', 'relearn', 'Quoyle', 'eyes', 'film.This', 'treasure', 'fantastic', 'talents', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'gorgeous', 'Jason', 'Behr', 'wonderful', 'Gainer', 'sisters', 'Alyssa', 'Kaitlyn', 'Lauren', 'role', 'psychically', 'gifted', 'Bunny', 'several', 'different', 'ages']",The Shipping News

""Shipping News"" is right up there with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""Here's the scoop. Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) is kind of a schlub but it might not be his nature but more in how his father treated him. He marries the awful Petal (Cate Blanchett) because she was the only woman who ever even looked at him. She dies in a car accident after having sold their daughter Bunny. He takes Bunny up to Newfoundland with his grandmother where his entire life changes.This town in Newfoundland is a real hoot. Boats are the thing. Everyone has one and they all seem to know a good boat from a bad boat. The rickety house he lives in is tied to the ground, off a rocky shore, with steel cables. He finds that his family name is infamous in the area as being ruthless pirates and, by a fluke he gets a job as a reporter, befriends a local lady (Julianne Moore) who is also single and has a 'slow' son. But he starts to come alive. In Poughkeepsie he might have gotten lost in the crowd but here he begins to find a sense of self worth. His confidence grows by many degrees. The stories he writes for the local newspaper are gaining him attention which helps put him in tighter with the odd community.This starts a bit rough. Even Spacey seems off his mark. But when things move from Poughkeepsie to Newfoundland things pick up a lot. Hallstrom works the territory. This area of Newfoundland is bleak most of the time. There are some sunny, calm days but overall it's very foreboding. Storms, fog, freezing rain. Makes you wonder why anyone would live there. It has such a haunting quality, but it adds to the overall.

697992,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B0000640VK,"""flickjunkie""","[5, 7]","Director Lasse Halstrom continues to prove himself to be outstanding at presenting sensitive human dramas with this touching film about a broken man's retreat to his ancestral roots.  This poignant tale unwinds deliberately and delicately as each of the main characters shares his or her dark secrets buried in the past.Halstrom is an inspired actors' director who entices outstanding performances from his troupe.  He has a wonderful ability to make simple characters appear bigger than life.  I continue to admire his unobtrusive presentation, forgoing ostentatious directorial stylizing in favor of simple shots that let the story and the characters dominate.  The cinematography and choice of locations in this film are understated and lovely without the need for garishness.The acting is superb.  Kevin Spacey, as Quoyle, once again shows his range, taking on an emotionally crippled character that is quite unlike the confident and clever characters that jump off his resume.  Spacey relinquishes all traces of the cockiness that is his trademark and brilliantly renders a pathetic nebbish whose greatest daily struggle is to overcome his own ennui.  For Spacey to suppress his natural dynamism to slip this character on so effectively is a testimony to his excellence as an actor.While this is clearly Spacey's film, the supporting cast of accomplished veterans weaves a splendid tapestry.  Julianne Moore is excellent as Quoyle's love interest with a delicate portrayal of a character that is simultaneously supportive and insecure.  Judi Dench is marvelous as Quoyle's crusty old aunt, who drags him back to Newfoundland to find himself among the ashes of his unseemly clan.  Cate Blanchett is bodacious as the impulsive vamp who ravishes Quoyle and stays with him only long enough to give him a daughter.  Scott Glenn is terrific as the cantankerous publisher of the local newspaper who turns Quoyle from a typesetter into a reporter.This film is not for everyone.  It is extremely deliberate and will fray the patience of the average viewer.  However, for those who have a love of human interest stories with flawed but lovable characters, this will be a treat.  I rated it a 9/10.

The Swedish director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m (""The Cider House Rules"", ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""Chocolat"") brought it full of genius to screen. It is a MUST to see the scene, where the ancestors of Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) are pulling by rope their house across the ice. The pictures shot on location (Killick-Claw, a Newfoundland harbor town) are simply wonderful. But at first you have to endure the coming in-chapter: a bad life in New York, where Quoyle is overwhelmed by hussy type Petal (Cate Blanchett), a wild, hot-blooded woman, wearing a ton of make-up and short rubber mini-skirts, always looking for excitement with good time guys and honky-tonks, by whom Quoyle has a child, Bunny. Petal soon dies in a car crash with one of her boyfriends, short after Bunny was sold by her to a black-market child adoption ring for six thousand dollars. Moreover Quoyle's parents commit suicide. In this terrible situation (daughter Bunny is found by police) Aunt Agnes Hamm (Judi Dench) appears and Quoyle is convinced by her to move to their ancestral home on the Newfoundland coast. Quoyle takes a job as a reporter for the local newspaper The Gammy Bird and starts to rebuild his life, though the weight of an awful past bears down. Encouraged by the publisher Jack Buggit (Scott Glenn) and by Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore), the owner of a day care center, Quoyle has to change his loser-life fighting against his demons and the demons of his ancestors. Also Aunt Angie or the ""widow"" Wavey have their nightmares, but together they get all problems under control. For example the mobbing of an oil-tanker-adoring journalist (Pete Postlethwaite) or getting overboard without a life-belt or losing the house tethered on a storm-wracked cliff during a heavy, cathartic storm. (And at the side there is a romance between Quoyle's daughter Bunny and Moore's son, who suffered brain damage during birth.) Spacey and Moore are wonderful as they, at her lowest point, try to overcome their damaged hearts and love once more. So they all recover from the terrors of their past lives, especially Quoyle's transformation from passive victim into a whole human being is heart-felt.

And it is silly, foolish, bombastic, and so overwhelmingly full of every detail I hate about contemporary film that it almost made me laugh aloud. Obviously, this carefully focus group tested schmaltz has lots of focus group members who enjoyed its approved parade of cliches and feel good pablum.

Not surprisingly, bored with the tedium of a slightly dim puppy worship, that wife moves on and gets hers. Serves her right. And mighty convenient.And then Quoyle, untrained and barely coherent when speaking, grows into a reporter when someone pats him on the back says, ""I believe in you."" What does that say about newspapers? A middle-aged guy with an 85 IQ can triumph in that profession when handed an I-B-M computer?

In THE SHIPPING NEWS, Spacey is Quoyle, a dull man with the cutting edge of a plastic butter knife.Quoyle is an ink loader for a local rag, the Poughkeepsie News. One day, he has the great good luck to score with the local tramp, Petal (Cate Blanchett). Then follows the enormous bad luck to impregnate and marry her. Now, Quoyle's raises his six-year old daughter Bunny while Petal continues to troll for studs. She even brings her lovers home, a practice that would enrage most husbands, but not the meek and lovesick Quoyle. Early on in the film, Quoyle is beset with a series of mind-numbing personal tragedies that result in his Aunt Agnis showing up on the doorstep. She convinces her nephew to bring himself and Bunny to Newfoundland, their ancestral place of origin, to start a new life. Quoyle's great effort to see this through despite a heavy load of emotional and psychological baggage is the essence of the movie. Along the way, Quoyle gets a correspondent's job to report THE SHIPPING NEWS - and thus the film's title - for the town paper despite the chief editor's comment that he hasn't the sense God gave a donut.The movie was filmed in Newfoundland (and Nova Scotia), so the scenery is fabulous if you like cold, windswept, rocky shores. Unfortunately, the best performances are by relatively minor characters, Jack Buggitt (Scott Glenn) as the chief editor of the Gammy Bird, and Petal. Cate Blanchett as the latter is on screen for way too short a time, and is almost unrecognizable in her role as the bimbo that enthralls. Judi Dench as Agnis is predictably competent, but her great talent is so effortless that she must absolutely shine to stand out, and she doesn't here. Daughter Bunny is used simply as the occasional walk-on prop, and could've been eliminated from the script entirely. As the new woman in Quoyle's new life, Julianne Moore as Wavey doesn't call up whatever passion would seem necessary to re-ignite our hero's fire. (I'd forgotten, though, how attractive Ms. Moore can be in a cold sort of way.)I can't say that this film isn't pleasant or entertaining. It's both; the cast is too good to fail miserably. However, every story needs conflict, and Quoyle's battle with his inner demons never reaches a fever pitch, nor does it necessarily stand out from the internal conflicts being waged by Agnis and Wavey. At the conclusion, I got the impression that whatever Quoyle gained he got by default rather than having to really work at it. The Quoyle persona was just too much of a milquetoast, and Spacey was, in my opinion, miscast.",3,Without the sense God gave a donut,1009670400,"12 30, 2001",2001,2721,"['previous', 'films', 'USUAL', 'SUSPECTS', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'K-PAX', 'etc', 'actor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'played', 'pretty', 'much', 'sharpest', 'knife', 'drawer', 'THE', 'SHIPPING', 'NEWS', 'Spacey', 'Quoyle', 'dull', 'man', 'cutting', 'edge', 'plastic', 'butter', 'knife.Quoyle', 'ink', 'loader', 'local', 'rag', 'Poughkeepsie', 'News', 'One', 'day', 'great', 'good', 'luck', 'score', 'local', 'tramp', 'Petal', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Then', 'enormous', 'bad', 'luck', 'impregnate', 'marry', 'Now', 'Quoyle', 'six-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Bunny', 'Petal', 'troll', 'studs', 'even', 'lovers', 'home', 'practice', 'would', 'enrage', 'most', 'husbands', 'not', 'meek', 'lovesick', 'Quoyle', 'Early', 'film', 'Quoyle', 'beset', 'series', 'mind-numbing', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'result', 'Aunt', 'Agnis', 'showing', 'up', 'doorstep', 'nephew', 'bring', 'Bunny', 'Newfoundland', 'ancestral', 'place', 'origin', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'Quoyle', 'great', 'effort', 'see', 'heavy', 'load', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'baggage', 'essence', 'movie', 'way', 'Quoyle', 'correspondent', 'job', 'report', 'THE', 'SHIPPING', 'NEWS', 'thus', 'film', 'title', 'town', 'paper', 'chief', 'editor', 'comment', ""n't"", 'sense', 'God', 'gave', 'donut.The', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Newfoundland', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'scenery', 'fabulous', 'like', 'cold', 'windswept', 'rocky', 'shores', 'Unfortunately', 'best', 'performances', 'are', 'relatively', 'minor', 'characters', 'Jack', 'Buggitt', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'chief', 'editor', 'Gammy', 'Bird', 'Petal', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'latter', 'screen', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'role', 'bimbo', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Agnis', 'predictably', 'competent', 'great', 'talent', 'so', 'effortless', 'must', 'absolutely', 'shine', 'stand', 'out', ""n't"", 'here', 'Daughter', 'Bunny', 'used', 'simply', 'occasional', 'walk-on', 'prop', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'eliminated', 'script', 'entirely', 'new', 'woman', 'Quoyle', 'new', 'life', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Wavey', ""n't"", 'call', 'up', 'passion', 'would', 'seem', 'necessary', 're-ignite', 'hero', 'fire', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'though', 'how', 'attractive', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'can', 'be', 'cold', 'sort', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'pleasant', 'entertaining', 'cast', 'too', 'good', 'fail', 'miserably', 'However', 'story', 'conflict', 'Quoyle', 'battle', 'inner', 'demons', 'never', 'fever', 'pitch', 'necessarily', 'stand', 'out', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'being', 'waged', 'Agnis', 'Wavey', 'conclusion', 'got', 'impression', 'Quoyle', 'gained', 'got', 'default', 'rather', 'having', 'really', 'work', 'Quoyle', 'persona', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'milquetoast', 'Spacey', 'was', 'opinion', 'miscast']",The Shipping News

The story is extremely simple, but thankfully enlivened by good acting and occasional quirkiness on the part of the characters and situations (the kind of amusing quirkiness and humor we often see in this particular director's films).  The scenery is quite nice, too, though undercut a bit by a surprisingly grainy and dull DVD transfer.  The 25-minute or so &quot;making of&quot; documentary is extremely annoying, as 75% of it is basically just clips from the film (to me, that's taking the lazy route), with very little in the way of interviews and behind-the-scenes stuff.  There's also a commentary, but I confess that the film didn't sufficiently interest me enough to watch it again with the commentary turned on.  To conclude with some final thoughts about the movie itself, though I'll grant some points for subtlety, I still would have appreciated seeing more in the way of overt and dramatic examples of exactly how and why our main character stops being a doormat and reactor to the world around him and someone more in control and confident by film's end.  I agree with another reviewer who said that the voice-over narration (especially at the end) comes off as a too-obvious attempt to provide thematic focus that is lacking in the film itself.  So, in the end, the film is worth a look for the scenery, acting, and some amusing character and story bits, as well as some memorable imagery here and there (like the house being dragged across the ice), but you certainly won't kick yourself when it's over for not catching the movie in the theater.",3,"Never rises above &quot;pleasant&quot;, but I guess that's okay",1063238400,"09 11, 2003",2003,1687,"['enough', 'here', 'make', 'perfectly-watchable', 'evening', 'home', 'entertainment', 'as', 'long', 'one', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'extremely', 'simple', 'thankfully', 'enlivened', 'good', 'acting', 'occasional', 'quirkiness', 'part', 'characters', 'situations', 'kind', 'amusing', 'quirkiness', 'humor', 'often', 'see', 'particular', 'director', 'films', 'scenery', 'quite', 'nice', 'too', 'undercut', 'bit', 'surprisingly', 'grainy', 'dull', 'DVD', 'transfer', '25-minute', 'so', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'documentary', 'extremely', 'annoying', '75', '%', 'basically', 'just', 'clips', 'film', 'taking', 'lazy', 'route', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'interviews', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff', 'also', 'commentary', 'confess', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'sufficiently', 'interest', 'enough', 'watch', 'again', 'commentary', 'turned', 'conclude', 'final', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'though', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'points', 'subtlety', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'seeing', 'more', 'way', 'overt', 'dramatic', 'examples', 'exactly', 'how', 'why', 'main', 'character', 'stops', 'being', 'doormat', 'reactor', 'world', 'someone', 'more', 'control', 'confident', 'film', 'end', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'especially', 'end', 'off', 'too-obvious', 'attempt', 'provide', 'thematic', 'focus', 'lacking', 'film', 'So', 'end', 'film', 'look', 'scenery', 'acting', 'amusing', 'character', 'story', 'bits', 'as', 'well', 'memorable', 'imagery', 'here', 'there', 'house', 'being', 'dragged', 'ice', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'kick', 'when', 'over', 'not', 'catching', 'movie', 'theater']",The Shipping News

His recently deceased father's younger half-sister (Dame Judi Dench) appears on his doorstep and talks him into relocating to Newfoundland, their ancestral home.The bulk of the story takes place on the wild Canadian coast, forming a spectacular backdrop for this tale of wounded souls slowly healing themselves. In a new job as reporter for the tiny community's newspaper, Spacey slowly blossoms as he is drawn to a widow (Julianne Moore) whose husband drowned under mysterious circumstances. The theme of dark past secrets uncovered runs through the various incidents, with Dench confronting her traumatic past as well. The script is well-written and the performances for the most part carefully calibrated, eventually drawing the viewer in. Surprisingly enough, it is Spacey who comes off least well. Quoyle, his character, should be emotionally shell-shocked, not simple-minded, but in the early portion of the film the actor comes off as a first cousin to Forrest Gump, quite overawed by Blanchett, who makes the most of her rather underwritten part.

698016,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000640VK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","&quot;The Shipping News&quot; is one of those films where I find myself compelled to go out and read the novel, because you get the feeling that there is just so much more out there about these characters.  However, if you listen to the commentary track on the DVD version of this film you will probably here more than you want to about what else is in the book and what they changed/omitted/added from the book than you might possibly want to know.  Anyhow, this time around we are talking about Lasse Hallstrom's film.The story of &quot;The Shipping News&quot; is certainly nothing new: a weary man, R. G. Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) beaten down by life returns to the home of his father and finds an entirely new life.  What makes the story work are the place and the characters.  What makes the film work is the scenery and the actors.  After a whirlwind introduction to Quoyle and the disaster his life has become, he and his daughter Bunny are taken under the wing of his Aunt Agnis (Judi Dench), who suddenly appears on his doorstep after the suicide of his father.  Her solution is to take Quoyle to Newfoundland where he finds himself suddenly working for the &quot;Gammy Bird,&quot; the local newspaper, where he is supposed to write the Shipping News.  Everyone at the newspaper is a colorful character (Gordon Pinset as Billy Pretty is my favorite of the lot) and there is Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore), a widow lady who runs the local day care and whose life story is almost as sad as Quoyle's.  Then we throw into the mix the strange green house cabled to the point and the rather brutal history of the family Quoyle.Obviously the guy is going to get the girl in this film, but the romance aspect of &quot;The Shipping News&quot; is such a slow and torturous dance that you are compelled to root for this couple to drop their barriers and finally find each other (this was where the unpredictable elements of the film's predictable storyline won me over).  Meanwhile each performance in this film is pretty much an exquisite little character study.  For my money Kevin Spacey is the finest actor working in films today and his performance as Quoyle is simply unlike anything you have seen him do to date.  This is a subtle performance of a man waking from what has been essentially a lifelong dream to join the real world.  Like Spacey, Judi Dench's best scenes involve silence, where a look becomes more eloquent than dialogue.  Julianne Moore turns in an understated performance that matches this pair, while Cate Blanchett in a small but pivotal role as Petal gives the film its initial emotional charge.  Scott Glenn as Jack Buggit, owner and publisher of the &quot;Gammy Bird&quot; provides the strange opportunity for Quoyle to find a new life (while gutting fish at the same time).I would be inclined to think that those who have admired the group of actors seen in this film from their previous performances will be more enamored with &quot;The Shipping News&quot; than those who come to it from having read E. Annie Proulx's novel.  However, I like films in which I get the feeling there is much more to the characters, the story, and the world in which they live, which is why I feel so inclined to go read the novel and see what else went on up in Newfoundland with Quoyle and company.  This is one of the better character studies to come down the road for a while and if that is you cup of tea, then definitely check out this film.",5,Great actors as interesting characters in familiar storyline,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,3451,"['quot', 'Shipping', 'News', 'quot', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'find', 'compelled', 'go', 'out', 'read', 'novel', 'get', 'feeling', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'there', 'characters', 'However', 'listen', 'commentary', 'track', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'here', 'more', 'want', 'what', 'else', 'book', 'what', 'changed/omitted/added', 'book', 'might', 'possibly', 'want', 'know', 'Anyhow', 'time', 'are', 'talking', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'film.The', 'story', 'quot', 'Shipping', 'News', 'quot', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'new', 'weary', 'man', 'R.', 'G.', 'Quoyle', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'beaten', 'down', 'life', 'returns', 'home', 'father', 'entirely', 'new', 'life', 'What', 'story', 'work', 'are', 'place', 'characters', 'What', 'film', 'work', 'scenery', 'actors', 'whirlwind', 'introduction', 'Quoyle', 'disaster', 'life', 'become', 'daughter', 'Bunny', 'are', 'taken', 'wing', 'Aunt', 'Agnis', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'who', 'suddenly', 'doorstep', 'suicide', 'father', 'solution', 'take', 'Quoyle', 'Newfoundland', 'where', 'suddenly', 'working', 'quot', 'Gammy', 'Bird', 'quot', 'local', 'newspaper', 'where', 'supposed', 'write', 'Shipping', 'News', 'Everyone', 'newspaper', 'colorful', 'character', 'Gordon', 'Pinset', 'Billy', 'Pretty', 'favorite', 'lot', 'Wavey', 'Prowse', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'widow', 'lady', 'who', 'local', 'day', 'care', 'life', 'story', 'almost', 'as', 'sad', 'Quoyle', 'Then', 'throw', 'mix', 'strange', 'green', 'house', 'cabled', 'point', 'rather', 'brutal', 'history', 'family', 'Quoyle.Obviously', 'guy', 'going', 'get', 'girl', 'film', 'romance', 'aspect', 'quot', 'Shipping', 'News', 'quot', 'slow', 'torturous', 'dance', 'are', 'compelled', 'root', 'couple', 'drop', 'barriers', 'finally', 'find', 'other', 'was', 'where', 'unpredictable', 'elements', 'film', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'won', 'over', 'Meanwhile', 'performance', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'exquisite', 'little', 'character', 'study', 'money', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'finest', 'actor', 'working', 'films', 'today', 'performance', 'Quoyle', 'simply', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'do', 'date', 'subtle', 'performance', 'man', 'waking', 'been', 'essentially', 'lifelong', 'dream', 'join', 'real', 'world', 'Spacey', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'best', 'scenes', 'involve', 'silence', 'where', 'look', 'more', 'eloquent', 'dialogue', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'understated', 'performance', 'pair', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'small', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Petal', 'film', 'initial', 'emotional', 'charge', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Jack', 'Buggit', 'owner', 'publisher', 'quot', 'Gammy', 'Bird', 'quot', 'strange', 'opportunity', 'Quoyle', 'find', 'new', 'life', 'gutting', 'fish', 'same', 'time', '.I', 'would', 'be', 'inclined', 'think', 'who', 'have', 'admired', 'group', 'actors', 'seen', 'film', 'previous', 'performances', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'enamored', 'quot', 'Shipping', 'News', 'quot', 'who', 'come', 'having', 'read', 'E.', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'novel', 'However', 'like', 'films', 'get', 'feeling', 'much', 'more', 'characters', 'story', 'world', 'live', 'why', 'feel', 'so', 'inclined', 'go', 'read', 'novel', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'went', 'Newfoundland', 'Quoyle', 'company', 'one', 'better', 'character', 'studies', 'come', 'down', 'road', 'while', 'cup', 'tea', 'then', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'film']",The Shipping News

Are you with me?  Now lets ask a question, do we care? Think about it.  I, for one, do not.  If I did not read the book (or even if I did) then why should I care if it was better than the film adapted from it.  To me it's like saying the screenplay was better than the movie.  General audiences do not read screenplays.  It only matters what is on the screen.  The book is not the movie.  It is just where the idea for the movie came from.  I am saying all this because every review I have read about this film has come with the caption, the book was better.  Hurray, good for the book.  However this is why I was not expecting much when I saw The Shipping News, but I thought Lasse Hallstrom is a good director and the cast is very good, could it be that bad?  Not only is this movie not bad, but it is quite good.  This is why I hate reading reviews before I see movies, and why, in general, I can't stand critics.  Why didn't anybody see this film?  Probably because some critic said, ""the book was better.""  The critic probably didn't even read it.The Shipping News tells the tale of a guy who goes way down on his luck, and finds redeption in the most unlikely of places.  It tells it well.  There area lot of characters in this story.  The names are familiar too, Cate Blanchett, Judi Dench, Scott Glen, Julianne Moore, and Kevin Spacey.  They are all very good.  Of course the story revolves around Spacey's character Quoyle, but each of the supporting players has their own role to play to flesh out different aspects of Quoyle.  I thought it was done quite effectively.Every now and then a movie just strikes me.  This happened with The Shipping News.  I just related to it, and I enjoyed it.  I could bore readers with the whys, but really there are plenty of other reviews to read if you want a more objective opinion about this film.  I don't feel like beating this one to death.  I just liked it.By the way, if you enjoyed this film I reccomend checking out other films by Lasse Hallstrom.

The bonus materials on the DVD add to the experience after having seen the film.  Hearing the care that was taken into selecting the location and finding out that the daughter Bunny was seemlessly played by triplets adds to appreciation of the film.  I'm becoming a Kevin Spacey fan because he seems so different in his characters.  Quoyle is different than KPAX or American Beauty.  Yet, Spacey fills the screen and captures our interest while looking like Gene Hackman's son.  Judy Dench is another tremendous star.  The added DVD materials are helpful as the director tells how he pictured her for this film while working with her on Chocolat.  The moment where she throws her brother's ashes down the outhouse hole is worth the price.  Blanchett and Moore turn in top notch portrayals.

Not really in this one. While there is much star talent aboard, it did seem a bit disjointed as some have suggested. Things did pick up for Spacey's character toward the end, but I'm not sure why some things were added. If his life wasn't already bad enough, the author had to add rape and incest.

Annie Proulx who specializes in using macabre details in her moody and sad books.Quoyle's wife, played by Cate Blanchett, is a tramp who treats him like dirt and, when she is killed in a car crash and leaves him with their 6-year old daughter, he is an emotional wreck.  That's when his aunt, played by Judi Dench enters the scene and convinces him to move back to the place of his roots, a remote village in Newfoundland where he lands a job as a reporter on the town newspaper, and falls for a local woman, Julianne Moore.This is not a simple story, however, as there are haunting mysteries everywhere, mysteries that made me squirm uncomfortably as they were uncovered.  This is not a pleasant film to watch and the story, although fascinating, moved a little too slow for my taste.Clearly, the best part of the film is the outstanding performance of Kevin Spacey.  I always knew he was a good actor, but this is a difficult role as we watch him transform from an emotionally damaged doormat husband into a man.  Along the way there are tears and fear and terror.  And the way he plays it, it all becomes real.  In my opinion, he should have been nominated for an Academy Award.The setting comes alive and there was great cinematography of the harsh Newfoundland coast. The film is disturbing, as it is supposed to be, but some of the details are never explained to my satisfaction, and, at the end, there were still questions hanging.

""What about The Shipping News?"", she proposed. I hadn't heard of it, but so what? I agreed, especially when I learned that Judi Densch was in it. She's like the female equivalent of Gene Hackman: always turns in a reliable performance.This is a strange story, about an extremely passive, put-upon man who honestly believes the lines a trollopy Cate Blanchett uses on him, and marries her. Even after their daughter is born, she continues picking up men while he just hangs about, not conjuring up her or the audience's respect. Then, wham! Lots of intense personal tragedy for Kevin Spacey, with the upshot being that he heads out with newfound aunt Judi to Newfoundland, the place of the family's origin. Seems just about everyone in town--the aunt, Kevin's new girlfriend, you name it--has more than one skeleton in the closet.

The storyline has the mystical magic in it but unlike Chocolat it didn't catch me as much and pull my interest. I remember going out and reading the book after seeing Chocolat, this movie just didn't have the intrigue that I would have liked.

698024,A9H8FQ9LDFK2H,B0000640VK,"M. A. Bechaz ""bookaholic""","[2, 3]","I am so glad I took the time to watch this movie!As I writer myself, I am often critical of others' work. But this is one of those movies that was so well written, and so well made, that while I was watching it I could only sit there thinking: I wish I'd had the skill to write this.Like a tapestry, the threads of the story weave together to make a magnificent whole, of which every part is simply beautiful. It is subtle yet bold, slow moving yet frenetic, ordinary yet extraordinary, exhilarating yet sad, and hilarious yet serious.The directing is superb, the cinematography magical, and the cast top notch, comprising some of the best actors from at least three continents of the world. The scripting is wonderful and insightful, with not a wasted word, and has a sly sense of humour that sneaks up on you and catches you unawares. But whilst the dialogue is at all times brilliant, sometimes the cleverest things about the script are actually the things that AREN'T said--the implications, the realisations you are left with. This is definitely a movie that will make you think, and make you feel.If you asked me to describe the plot of this movie, I truly couldn't. The basic premise is 'man loses wife and parents, moves back to ancestral home'. Sound ordinary, doesn't it? But this story is anything BUT ordinary. It twists, and turns, and fools you into thinking it's flowing slowly and gently, even while it is constantly throwing unexpected surprises at you (the one thing this film is NOT is predictable!) I was rivetted to the screen throughout the entire film, and that's saying something, because like many people in my generation, I usually have the attention span of a goldfish.I have read the other reviews on this page, and I must say, some of them seemed to miss the point of this movie. One reviewer complained that you never really get to know the characters properly at the start of the movie. But as I see it, that's a good thing. At the beginnning, we know as much about the characters as they know about themselves--only what matters to get by. But as the movie progresses, the characters, especially the main ones, learn more about themselves, and in the process, we learn more about them too. Seriously, if every detail about the characters had been explained to us right from the start, it would have defeated the point of this movie, which is a voyage of discovery for both the characters and the viewers. It would have been like Agatha Christie revealing on page one that the butler did it. Where would the fun be in that? The reviewer also complained that he did not 'connect' with the characters. But I disagree, because I totally did, especially the main character, who had been told for so long that he was a pathetic good-for-nothing that he ended up believing it. He is downtrodden, bullied, the kind of man who lives a life so ordinary that no-one notices him...until the day when he does get noticed by a girl called Petal, and his life changes forever. Anyone who has ever felt hard done by, anyone who has ever been bullied, anyone who has had an imperfect family life, and anyone who has ever yearned to do more with their life, but wasn't entirely sure how, will empathise with this man from the first moment of the movie. He is drowning in the misery of his life. But given time, he might actually learn to swim...I don't know why this movie never scored big at the Oscars or the Golden Globes. Perhaps Julianne Moore should have put on a big fake nose or something, since that was enough to win Nicole Kidman the best actress award!This movie is great. You really should see it. But just in case you need any extra reason to watch it, let me tell you, the music soundtrack totally kicks butt! Oh, and the role of Petal is played by Cate Blanchett, who all you Lord of the Rings fans will know very well.

After Petal dies in a car crash, Quoyle reconnects with his Aunt Agnis (Judi Dench), who has come to New York after the death of her brother, Quoyle's father.  Both at a loss, they decide to return to the family home in Newfoundland.  The old house, tied down by cables to keep it from blowing away in storms, is still standing, though it has been empty for forty-four years, and the family moves in.Working not as an inksetter but as a reporter for a local newspaper, Quoyle reports car crashes and the shipping news.  Though he has no sense of drama and no real writing ability, he finds that some of the stories he uncovers interest people, and he begins to develop emotionally.  Through his contact with a vivid local community and the friendships that evolve, he uncovers some of his own family history, shows a confidence he's never had before, and begins to face his personal demons, as do daughter Bunny and Aunt Agnis.  Helping him along the way is Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore), whose own life is as filled with dark secrets as that of the Quoyle family.Adapting Annie Proulx's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel to the screen, scriptwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs remains true to the characters of the novel, but sacrifices their depth and subtlety, leaving them hollow and lacking true motivation. Spacey effectively portrays Quoyle's awkwardness and naivete but plays each scene as if it were unconnected with those going before and after, and Julianne Moore, while sympathetic toward Quoyle, does not feel like a ""real"" Newfoundlander with emotional ties to the rest of the community.  Because neither character is fully developed, the action, which is character-based, fails to move the viewer.Oliver Stapleton's cinematography is coldly stark, filled with angry winds and weather but so beautifully photographed that in many ways it is the strongest aspect of the film.  Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom, nominated for a Best Director Oscar for 1999's The Cider House Rules, here flits from scene to scene and subject to subject, never really developing the kind of tension and drama that comes from careful pacing and strong, fully drawn characters.  More melodramatic and less humorous than the novel, the film is, nevertheless, an atmospheric and fascinating glimpse of a unique culture and way of life.

Hartley ""Zimra""","[0, 0]","Kevin Spacey plays the hero, Quoyle, in this movie about Newfoundland, and Dame Judi Dench plays his aunt, who spirits him away from New York State to this far-different land. The movie is a faithful adaptation of the novel by Annie Proulx, who is herself descended from Newfoundlanders.For all of you who don't know, Newfoundland is an island off the east coast of Canada, its tenth province, which did not come into Confederation until 1949. Newfies (as they are affectionately called in Canada - and besides: it's shorter than saying ""Newfoundlanders"" all the time) have always been and still are, fiercely independent people, descended from some Norse but mainly the Irish. They still refer to other Canadian as being ""from away.""The story revolves around a hapless American (Kevin Spacey) of whom it could be said that if he didn't have bad luck, he'd have no luck at all. Quiet, unassuming, bashful, back-seat Quoyle marries an out-front gregariously sexy lady (Cate Blanchett) and is continually and cruelly used by her, which he tolerates. They have a daughter. Predictably, she deserts him and her child for another man and she and the man are killed in an auto accident.Quoyle probably would have gone on in his quiet, emotionally- blunted way except for the appearance of an aunt about which he knew nothing (Judi Dench) who spirits them off to their ancestral home of Newfoundland.Life on The Rock is different, to say the least. Quoyle gets a job on a small, local newspaper to report on the shipping news. Totally out of his league, he gets some humorous pointers from one member of the staff, played by the vintage Canadian actor, Gordon Pinsent (himself a Newfie). Along the way, Quoyle meets a female (Julianne Moore), with a damaged child who is as blighted as Quoyle is by a former husband. They are both victims who hesitate through life, never thoroughly grasping it, who stand aside and let events just happen to them. Therefore, their road to an eventual union is one of hesitation rather then action.Under all these superficial events lie some deep, dark secrets of the Quoyle ancestors, which gradually surface.It is how the protagonists deal with these emerging events and each other that creates the crux of a compelling story. Suffice to say that Quoyle eventually develops some back bone. It becomes for him, literally and figuratively, a case of ""sink of swim.""I only gave this movie 4 stars because although it's a nice movie, it's not a great movie, although the performances of the actors are excellent (especially Gordon Pinsent) and the story is a compelling and at times, heart-rending one.But it's definitely worth seeing.So for all you people ""from away,"" you really should take a boo at it.",4,Spacey & Dench: could it get any better?,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,2729,"['Kevin', 'Spacey', 'hero', 'Quoyle', 'movie', 'Newfoundland', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'aunt', 'who', 'away', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'far-different', 'land', 'movie', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'who', 'descended', 'Newfoundlanders.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Newfoundland', 'island', 'east', 'coast', 'Canada', 'tenth', 'province', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'Confederation', '1949', 'Newfies', 'are', 'affectionately', 'called', 'Canada', 'shorter', 'saying', 'Newfoundlanders', 'time', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'still', 'are', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'people', 'descended', 'Norse', 'mainly', 'Irish', 'still', 'refer', 'other', 'Canadian', 'being', 'away', 'story', 'around', 'hapless', 'American', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'whom', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'luck', ""'d"", 'have', 'luck', 'Quiet', 'unassuming', 'bashful', 'back-seat', 'Quoyle', 'marries', 'out-front', 'gregariously', 'sexy', 'lady', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'continually', 'cruelly', 'used', 'have', 'daughter', 'Predictably', 'child', 'man', 'man', 'are', 'killed', 'auto', 'accident.Quoyle', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'quiet', 'emotionally-', 'blunted', 'way', 'appearance', 'aunt', 'knew', 'nothing', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'who', 'off', 'ancestral', 'home', 'Newfoundland.Life', 'Rock', 'different', 'say', 'least', 'Quoyle', 'job', 'small', 'local', 'newspaper', 'report', 'shipping', 'news', 'Totally', 'league', 'humorous', 'pointers', 'one', 'member', 'staff', 'played', 'vintage', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'Newfie', 'way', 'Quoyle', 'female', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'damaged', 'child', 'who', 'as', 'blighted', 'Quoyle', 'former', 'husband', 'are', 'victims', 'who', 'hesitate', 'life', 'never', 'thoroughly', 'grasping', 'who', 'stand', 'aside', 'let', 'events', 'just', 'happen', 'Therefore', 'road', 'eventual', 'union', 'one', 'hesitation', 'rather', 'then', 'action.Under', 'superficial', 'events', 'lie', 'deep', 'dark', 'secrets', 'Quoyle', 'ancestors', 'gradually', 'how', 'protagonists', 'deal', 'emerging', 'events', 'other', 'crux', 'compelling', 'story', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Quoyle', 'eventually', 'back', 'bone', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'case', 'sink', 'swim', 'only', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'nice', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'performances', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'story', 'compelling', 'times', 'heart-rending', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing.So', 'people', 'away', 'really', 'should', 'take', 'boo']",The Shipping News

Although quite slow at times, the movie effectively illustrates the transformation of a quiet and shy man, a ""loser,"" who finds himself and love in the wilds of Newfoundland.  Kevin Spacey does a strong job as Quoyle, who takes his young daughter off to Newfoundland when his wife (the wonderful Cate Blanchett, in a small role) is killed while running off with a lover.  Judi Dench plays Quoyle's aunt, a somewhat acerbic and bitter woman, who has her own skeletons.  In Newfoundland, Spacey gets a job as the shipping news reporter, and although not qualified for the job, his tenacity and naivete eventually lead to his success.  Scott Glenn has a nice role as the gruff owner of the paper.  Love comes when Quoyle meets the lovely Wavey, played well by the talented Julianne Moore, who also has her own sad past.  Despite a lot of melancholy, the movie has some humorous scenes and a fine cast of supporting actors, including Jason Behr as Glenn's son, Dennis, who exudes a quiet and likeable charm.  Christopher Young's musical score is wonderful and adds a lot to the movie's atmosphere.Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but if you like a good drama with a good story and cast, THE SHIPPING NEWS won't leave you afloat.",4,BOAT AGAINST THE CURRENT,1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,1369,"['Lalle', 'Hallstrom', 'keen', 'eye', 'visual', 'beauty', 'coaxing', 'restrained', 'effective', 'performances', 'SHIPPING', 'NEWS', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'quite', 'slow', 'times', 'movie', 'effectively', 'transformation', 'quiet', 'shy', 'man', 'loser', 'who', 'love', 'wilds', 'Newfoundland', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'strong', 'job', 'Quoyle', 'who', 'young', 'daughter', 'Newfoundland', 'when', 'wife', 'wonderful', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'small', 'role', 'killed', 'running', 'off', 'lover', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Quoyle', 'aunt', 'somewhat', 'acerbic', 'bitter', 'woman', 'who', 'own', 'skeletons', 'Newfoundland', 'Spacey', 'job', 'shipping', 'news', 'reporter', 'not', 'qualified', 'job', 'tenacity', 'naivete', 'eventually', 'lead', 'success', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'nice', 'role', 'gruff', 'owner', 'paper', 'Love', 'when', 'Quoyle', 'lovely', 'Wavey', 'played', 'well', 'talented', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'who', 'also', 'own', 'sad', 'past', 'lot', 'melancholy', 'movie', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'fine', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'including', 'Jason', 'Behr', 'Glenn', 'son', 'Dennis', 'who', 'quiet', 'likeable', 'charm', 'Christopher', 'Young', 'musical', 'score', 'wonderful', 'lot', 'movie', 'atmosphere.Maybe', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'like', 'good', 'drama', 'good', 'story', 'cast', 'THE', 'SHIPPING', 'NEWS', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'afloat']",The Shipping News

I've mostly enjoyed director Lasse Hallstom's films, most recently ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.""  This is no exception.  Stocked with a fine cast, the story involves a dweeb named Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) who is an ink man or something for a Poughkeepsie newspaper.  One night as he pulls into a gas station, a beautiful woman (Cate Blanchett) jumps in the car running from an abusive boyfriend.  As thanks, Petal (Blanchett) beds Quoyle which results in a child, Bunny (Gainer sisters).Years later, Petal's wild ways haven't changed.  She and her new boyfriend eventually take Bunny with plans to sell her to an illegal adoption agency.  Bunny returns to her dad, but Petal and company don't fare well.  In the meantime, Quoyle's parents die.  Quoyle's rarely seen Aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) shows up and convinces Quoyle to accompany her to their origins in Newfoundland.  Once there, Quoyle gets a job at the local newspaper, this time as a reporter.  He also meets a beautiful widow (Julianne Moore) and her mentally challenged young son.Adapted from Annie Proulx's novel, Hallstrom and Robert Nelson Jacobs's screenplay do a serviceable job moving the story along.  At times the film wants to slip into fantasy as the Quoyle's sullied history surfaces.  For the most part, the film avoids melodrama as it changes tone quite often.  Spacey's performance in particular buoys the sometimes sluggish film.While there is nothing particularly objectionable about the Blu ray 1080p transfer, it's nothing special either.  The aspect ratio is 2.35:1 which is close enough to the original.  The coloring seems a bit smeary and dull but that could be the film's settings, mostly a bleak and barren north Atlantic seaside.  The audio as well is pretty non-descript.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 is fine for most of the dialog driven scenes, but the film has several stormy scenes as well.  There are also some shots on and under water that could have been enhanced with a more enveloping audio track.

This movie brushed the story's surface rather admirably overall, but of necessity events moved quickly forward without subtleties.  Of course this leaves gaps that only leisurely chapter development and finely-tuned prose can fill.  But as this is the movie, the characters took over and thus became the tale.  Kevin Spacey's sympathetic Quoyle grows and changes on through to the film's end.  Dame Judi Dench, splendid as always, plays self-sufficient caustic Aunt Agnis who hides a terrible secret and rescues Quoyle from himself.  (Incidentally she's a lesbian as in NOTES ON A SCANDAL but that's not a major part of this story.) Petal, in the short time she's on screen, comes off as a truly nasty piece of work (Cate Blanchett, costar to Dench in NOTES). Wavey (Julianne Moore) lays her Newfie accent on a little thick but is beautiful and vulnerable with a strong substance behind those delicate looks.  Quoyle's daughter Bunny as a ""sensitive"" (she sees and knows things psychically) adds frisson to the surroundings, and the supporting cast comes off convincingly.  And then there's the gorgeous, powerful scenery.  The foggy lonely vistas, the dangerous sea, the storms rolling in.

It's in a wild coastal fishing village in Maine ( I think), or maybe Canada....that's never made clear to my ears...the story is full of really unique characters. I especially liked the work of star Kevin Spacey, whose character-the main one in the story- comes of age and finds a future in this little village. His scenes with his daughter regarding the legend of a ghost and in the newspaper office as he stands up to a self-appointed boss ares great, among many. Also in the story we find a day care teacher played by Julianne Moore (put this beauty in any plot and the film gets better!), who helps the Spacey character fit into the community better as she deals with personal demons from her own past.  Dame Judi Dench (out of Bondage mode) is the third star of the story and steals many scenes through her unique character having to overcome past personal strife also. The village is full of unusual and entertaining as well as puzzling characters!I had to search for a long time to find it on DVD, and Amazon came through for me as usual.

It was called ""Island"" and it had many divergent stories held together by the common thread of the narrator.  Taken one at a time or as a whole, it was an excellent book.  I was reminded of ""Island"" as I watched ""The Shipping News"" the other night.  I don't think that ""The Shipping News"" set out to be a collection of short stories with a common narrator but that is how it came across.  The main character, played schizophrenicly by Kevin Spacey, is involved in many things but the sequence of events lacks any sense of continuity.  There ARE scenes that inter-relate with prior scenes; sometimes with good effect.  However, most of them serve to distract rather than amplify.  As a result, I came away from ""The Shipping News"" with a sense that it was an opportunity wasted.I did not read ""The Shipping News"" so I have no idea if the movie was a disappoinment or an improvement to its' readers.  I was disappointed in the Spacey character because he evolved, as an adult, a bit too much to be credible to me.  I realize that the point was intended to show the development of a fellow human being who blossoms when others stop putting him down.  However, this just didn't work, for me.  There were family secrets that were shared that seemed, at times, to really have substance.  At other times they were so extreme that they came across as ridiculous.  The supporting cast was often  either hard to figure out or so simple that either extreme came across as a disappointment.  An incestuous relationship in the past was shown with exceptional brilliance yet it was counter-balanced by an inter-office feud that looked like out-takes from ""Married with Children"".  My rating of ""3 stars"" was a compromise of debating over whether it should be 2 or 4.

As a film achievement, director Lasse Hallstrm created a world that drew me in from the start. The journey that Kevin Spacey's character takes, from total dweeb to realist, is as well portrayed as can be done in a 2 hour narrative. The acting is flawless; Spacey, Dench, Glenn, and those characters in the news office, all perfect. Cate Blanchett was terrific, and let everyone know that she was a heartless slut, but it could've been more developed. There was real fire there. The main character is the Newfoundland coast, the weather and the gorgeous terrain. There's a fascination that held me to the final frames, and a satisfying ending.

We learn that fast when the man tosses his young son into the sea for a 'swimming lesson.' His father's expectations of failure marked Quoyle's early life.The opening of the film shows Quoyle's meeting the first woman he loved, Petal (Blanchett) and having a whirlwind relationship.  Petal abandoned Quoyle with their daughter, Bunny, only to return to take the child away and sell her to black market adopters for $6,000.Bunny was returned to Quoyle after the police discovered Petal and her current companion in a fatal car crash and found the adoption paperwork. Shortly after, Quoyle's parents commit joint suicide after Quoyle's father sends him a note expressing his disappointment with his life, Quoyle, etc.Quoyle and Bunny are still reeling from this double blow when his only living kin, Angis (Dench) shows up.  She's going back to their family's native homeland in Newfoundland and offers him a chance to come with them.Initially, Quoyle doesn't fit in with the locals.  He's afraid of the water.  He's shy and awkward, but a local newspaperman gives him a shot as a reporter with the shipping news and car crash beat and Quoyle quickly finds his place.""Shipping News"" is an intricate story that's well-acted and directed.

698051,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B0000640VK,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[1, 1]","In Will and Ian Ferguson's underrated masterpiece ""How To Be A Canadian,"" there is a chapter entitled ""Art and Stuff,"" in which they discuss Canadian literature, and in doing so identified the following elements present in ""The Shipping News"": incest, female character as empowered victim, graphic but ironic use of violent imagery, healing (but only at the end). This I have found true in a number of Canadian bestsellers. So how does ""The Shipping News"" hold up as a film in view of these dark elements?First, practically none of the actors are from Newfoundland (with the exception of the fantastic Gorden Pinsent, frequently seen on ""Due South""), which is evident in the mangled accents. It gains some respectability back by being filmed on location (between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia). And the soundtrack, with five contributions from Newfoundland's own Great Big Sea, is a rollicking collection of sea chanties smoothed with guitar, tin whistles and strings during the quieter moments. However, none of the Great Big Sea songs were featured on the soundtrack CD (minus twenty points!).The story (I don't want to give too much away since the story is certainly...original) deals with R.G. Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) and his scatterbrained girlfriend Petal (Cate Blanchett). The two have a young daughter, Bunny, and after Petal's demise Quoyle and Bunny head to Newfoundland to move into their ancestral home, along with Agnis Hamm, Quoyle's aunt. The rest of the story deals (somewhat predictably) with fitting into the new community, reconciliation with the past, brushes with death and the strength of family in the face of adversity. Quoyle works on the local newspaper writing the shipping news, which he adds his own personal touch to. We meet his coworkers (Billy, Tert, Beaufield and Jack), the lovely Wavey (Julianne Moore) who runs the local daycare and her mentally challenged son Herry, who becomes Bunny's playmate (another question: who NAMED these people?!), and long lost relatives and dark family secrets. There is a bit of strong language, alcohol use, violence (including a murder), disturbing images (including rape of a minor), and a brief sex scene, which give the film its R rating. If you enjoy artsy films, beautiful scenery, an unusual yarn, or Celtic (and Newfie) music, ""The Shipping News"" may be for you.",4,"Sail away on a tide of romance, betrayal and dark secrets",1045785600,"02 21, 2003",2003,2336,"['Will', 'Ian', 'Ferguson', 'underrated', 'masterpiece', 'How', 'Be', 'A', 'Canadian', 'chapter', 'entitled', 'Art', 'Stuff', 'discuss', 'Canadian', 'literature', 'doing', 'so', 'identified', 'following', 'elements', 'present', 'Shipping', 'News', 'incest', 'female', 'character', 'empowered', 'victim', 'graphic', 'ironic', 'use', 'violent', 'imagery', 'healing', 'only', 'end', 'have', 'found', 'true', 'number', 'Canadian', 'bestsellers', 'So', 'how', 'Shipping', 'News', 'hold', 'up', 'film', 'view', 'dark', 'elements', 'First', 'practically', 'none', 'actors', 'are', 'Newfoundland', 'exception', 'fantastic', 'Gorden', 'Pinsent', 'frequently', 'seen', 'Due', 'South', 'evident', 'mangled', 'accents', 'gains', 'respectability', 'back', 'being', 'filmed', 'location', 'Newfoundland', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'soundtrack', 'five', 'contributions', 'Newfoundland', 'own', 'Great', 'Big', 'Sea', 'rollicking', 'collection', 'sea', 'chanties', 'smoothed', 'guitar', 'tin', 'whistles', 'strings', 'quieter', 'moments', 'However', 'none', 'Great', 'Big', 'Sea', 'songs', 'were', 'featured', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'twenty', 'points', '.The', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'story', 'certainly', 'original', 'deals', 'R.G', 'Quoyle', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'scatterbrained', 'girlfriend', 'Petal', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'two', 'have', 'young', 'daughter', 'Bunny', 'Petal', 'demise', 'Quoyle', 'Bunny', 'head', 'Newfoundland', 'move', 'ancestral', 'home', 'Agnis', 'Hamm', 'Quoyle', 'aunt', 'rest', 'story', 'deals', 'somewhat', 'predictably', 'fitting', 'new', 'community', 'reconciliation', 'past', 'brushes', 'death', 'strength', 'family', 'face', 'adversity', 'Quoyle', 'local', 'newspaper', 'writing', 'shipping', 'news', 'own', 'personal', 'touch', 'meet', 'coworkers', 'Billy', 'Tert', 'Beaufield', 'Jack', 'lovely', 'Wavey', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'who', 'local', 'daycare', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'son', 'Herry', 'who', 'Bunny', 'playmate', 'question', 'who', 'NAMED', 'people', 'long', 'lost', 'relatives', 'dark', 'family', 'secrets', 'bit', 'strong', 'language', 'alcohol', 'use', 'violence', 'including', 'murder', 'disturbing', 'images', 'including', 'rape', 'minor', 'brief', 'sex', 'scene', 'give', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'enjoy', 'artsy', 'films', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'unusual', 'yarn', 'Celtic', 'Newfie', 'music', 'Shipping', 'News', 'may', 'be']",The Shipping News

This is an amazing story, with complex characters and which shows the idiosyncrasy of a population that is unknown for most of us. The movie shows how a broken man can heal with the help of loved ones and friends, even in an extremely tough place to live in.Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) had a disastrous childhood, with a demanding father that specialized in pushing him over the edge without giving him any love. As an adult, he works in the print of the Poughkeepsie News as an ink setter and has no one in this world. One day he stops at a gas station and Petal (Cate Blanchett), who was fighting with her boyfriend, gets into Quoyle's car and says: &quot;Let's go&quot;. Quoyle has such a need for a little love that he falls right away for Petal, she gets pregnant and they have a baby. But life is not easy for Quoyle; Petal sleeps around without any shame and does not take care of her daughter.To make matters worse, in a period of a few days Quoyle receives a phone call from his father telling him that he was killing himself and his wife, Petal runs away with their daughter and dies in a car crash, and Quoyle's aunt shows up at his house and steals the ashes of his father. After getting back his daughter and being at a total loss as to how to go on, Quoyle ends up moving to Newfoundland with his aunt and daughter. Here he meets new people, a different culture and new challenges that will change his life.The photography in this movie is absolutely outstanding, with scenes that leave the viewer breathless. The other aspect to praise, besides the great story, is the cast, in particular Kevin Spacey and Cate Blanchett. Even though the latter has a brief appearance, her role is so convincing, that she deserves credit for the overall outcome of the film. Julianne Moore plays Wavey, the owner of a day care center in Newfoundland that has lost her husband right before giving birth to their child. She does a good job in this role, but I have seen her do better in other scenarios.

This is supposed to be the story of Quoyle's transformation from exploited loser to self-determined family man with a new vision of life. But how and why does it happen? Where are the experiences that drive his inner change? What, he cheers up just because someone likes his news stories and he finds a similarly damaged girlfriend? It works in the novel, where we delve more deeply into Quoyle's character and past and come to understand him. But doing that in a film is more difficult - you can resort to dream sequences and flashbacks as this one does, but it's never really clear what these moments mean to Quoyle. Emergency explanatory voiceover is chopper-lifted in with the camera at the end, just in case you missed the point - and it's highly likely you will have. Like so many Oscar-hungry films these days, this one makes the mistake of thinking that a brilliant cast, soaring music, and a few lines of pontificating dialogue can hide an empty core. But you can't have light without darkness, you can't have growth without pain - and this film just doesn't have the nerve to go anywhere near either of them. Compare it with ""American Beauty"" and you'll see precisely what I mean.",2,"""Dive beneath the surface""?

698061,A2I5O8AEFU1SOK,B0000640VK,the_smoking_quill,"[9, 12]","The Shipping News chronicles the healing of Quoyle, a passively pathetic nobody who, with his young daughter, leaves New York for the Newfoundland of his ancestors after his wildly irresponsible wife Petal (a shockingly different Cate Blanchett) dies in a car crash with one of her paramours.Kevin Spacey turns in an excellent performance as the fleshy-faced, bumbling, meek and hollow Quoyle. (In fact, it may be more accurate to say the film tells of Quoyle's creation--the man-child who survived his abusive upbringing seems almost nonexistent as opposed to broken.) Julianne Moore is tenderly, simply beautiful as Quoyle's love interest, perhaps giving her finest performance. Judi Dench , as Quoyle's aunt who rescues him from New York, is just good enough, though lacking somehow. The cinematography, featuring the rock, water and snow of the North Atlantic, is generally well done.Much of the accented dialogue is difficult to understand at first, as is the plot unless one pays careful attention to the various dream sequences and impressionistic flashbacks which fill in the Quoyle family history. I will say that, several chapters into the novel, the film seems better, more direct, not thrown off balance by the author's ""clever"", continuous elimination of complete sentences and bombardment of similes and metaphors--which worked for the first couple of chapters but is now proving tedious. (And the film actually has one detail ""right"": if Petal came to detest Quoyle so much and only conceived their first child by accident, it's hard to see where a second would have come from. In the film, having but one daughter strengthens the character; in the book, the extra dulls the impact of both.) I cannot say for certain that I will finish the book.In all, 3-1/2 stars is about right for this film.

So why didn't I like ""The Shipping News"" more?Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) has had a life with few luxuries and little joy. His emotionally abusive father colors the rest of his life, shaping the outcome of everything Quoyle participates in. Working as an inksetter at a newspaper in New York, Quoyle meets Petal Bear (Cate Blanchett), a woman wearing a ton of make-up and short rubber mini-skirts. Petal lures Quoyle into bed and Quoyle has the most satisfying moment of his life, after which he promptly declares that he loves her. Petal becomes pregnant and gives birth to Bunny, their child. But motherhood is not in her plans. Quoyle is essentially left to take care of Bunny. A devestating experience coincides with the death of Quoyle's parents and the arrival of his aunt, Agnis (Judi Dench). Agnis decides that nephew and grand-niece would be better off in the family's home-town in Newfoundland. The trio travel north and take up residence in the family home on Quoyle Point. Quoyle gets a job writing the shipping news for the local newspaper, encouraged by the publisher, Jack Buggit (Scott Glenn) and soon meets the local school teacher, Wavey (Julianne Moore). As life becomes more peaceful, Quoyle must deal with his demons and the demons of his ancestors.Directed by Lasse Hallstrom and written by Robert Nelson Jacobs, from the book by E. Annie Proulx, ""The Shipping News"" becomes the latest in a string of films that Miramax has created in a blatant attempt to win an Oscar. Much like last year's ""Chocolat"" (also directed by Lasse Hallstrom and co-starring Judi Dench), the film is trying very hard to create an emotional storm, to woo potential Academy Awards and an increased box office. I would like to say that the film fails in these attempts, but I suspect it probably will win some nominations. The more important question is: Does it deserve to win nominations?Spacey is great. He appears every inch the emotionally beaten man. This man has been given no breaks in life and this has robbed him of all motivation. A bright glimmer of hope arrives in the form of his daughter, Bunny. His life changes a bit, but not enough. When the family arrives in Newfoundland, Spacey introduces small, but significant changes in the character, allowing him to change with the change of scenery. Judi Dench plays perhaps the most interesting character. Hard and grizzled with age, she seems to have an impenetrable hide. Occasionally, Agnis lets Quoyle and Bunny in, and warms up to them, letting the faade crumble away. Julianne Moore is also very good as the school teacher with a mentally challenged little boy and a secret in the past. The cast is uniformly good; Pete Postlethwaite, Jason Behr, Scott Glenn, Rhys Ifans and many others round out the cast of supporting characters, but they can't overcome the main problems with the story.There are two main problems. Every single character has a secret in their past or a problem that they are trying to hide. This is intended to give each of the characters some `heft', something to allow the actor to `emote'. In some cases, it works, but when every single character has this, it turns the story into a soap opera. Also, the film doesn't really seem to know what it wants to be, what sort of emotion we should feel. The film creates some genuine laughs about each of the characters but then, in almost every case, the same thing we were laughing about becomes the dramatic pinnacle of this character. In some cases, we shouldn't be laughing about these things at all. In a way, this made me feel cheated. As I am supposed to feel emotion for this character for this thing, I remembered back to earlier in the film when I was laughing about the same thing. Now that I know the full scope of the problem/ secret/ etc., I can't buy into it.I think both of these problems lie squarely on the shoulders of director Lasse Hallstrom and writer Robert Nelson Jacobs. I can't understand why they would do this so consistently. It robs the film of all impact. My only guess is that they were trying to alleviate the dramatic tension. Unfortunately, the dramatic tension has to be there in the first place for it to be relieved. If we laugh about something before we know what is going on, how can this relieve anything?The beginning is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. It visually establishes Quoyle's character and his entire life up to the point where the film takes up. Unfortunately, this is not carried throughout the film.If you can overlook the blatant attempt at trying to win an Oscar and soap opera feel of the film, there are some good performances worth catching, but the film is definitely a film that can be caught on video. I don't recommend the film, but I do recommend the performances.",3,Newsflash!,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,4870,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'really', 'lot', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'performances', 'So', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Shipping', 'News', 'more', 'Quoyle', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'had', 'life', 'few', 'luxuries', 'little', 'joy', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'father', 'colors', 'rest', 'life', 'shaping', 'outcome', 'everything', 'Quoyle', 'Working', 'inksetter', 'newspaper', 'New', 'York', 'Quoyle', 'Petal', 'Bear', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'woman', 'wearing', 'ton', 'make-up', 'short', 'rubber', 'mini-skirts', 'Petal', 'Quoyle', 'bed', 'Quoyle', 'most', 'satisfying', 'moment', 'life', 'promptly', 'Petal', 'becomes', 'pregnant', 'birth', 'Bunny', 'child', 'motherhood', 'not', 'plans', 'Quoyle', 'essentially', 'left', 'take', 'care', 'Bunny', 'devestating', 'experience', 'coincides', 'death', 'Quoyle', 'parents', 'arrival', 'aunt', 'Agnis', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Agnis', 'nephew', 'grand-niece', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'family', 'home-town', 'Newfoundland', 'trio', 'travel', 'north', 'take', 'up', 'residence', 'family', 'home', 'Quoyle', 'Point', 'Quoyle', 'job', 'writing', 'shipping', 'news', 'local', 'newspaper', 'encouraged', 'publisher', 'Jack', 'Buggit', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'soon', 'local', 'school', 'teacher', 'Wavey', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'life', 'more', 'peaceful', 'Quoyle', 'must', 'deal', 'demons', 'demons', 'ancestors.Directed', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'written', 'Robert', 'Nelson', 'Jacobs', 'book', 'E.', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'Shipping', 'News', 'latest', 'string', 'films', 'Miramax', 'created', 'blatant', 'attempt', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Much', 'last', 'year', 'Chocolat', 'also', 'directed', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'co-starring', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'film', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'create', 'emotional', 'storm', 'woo', 'potential', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'increased', 'box', 'office', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'film', 'attempts', 'suspect', 'probably', 'will', 'win', 'nominations', 'more', 'important', 'question', 'deserve', 'win', 'nominations', 'Spacey', 'great', 'inch', 'emotionally', 'beaten', 'man', 'man', 'been', 'given', 'breaks', 'life', 'robbed', 'motivation', 'bright', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'arrives', 'form', 'daughter', 'Bunny', 'life', 'bit', 'not', 'enough', 'When', 'family', 'Newfoundland', 'Spacey', 'small', 'significant', 'changes', 'character', 'allowing', 'change', 'change', 'scenery', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'Hard', 'grizzled', 'age', 'have', 'impenetrable', 'hide', 'Occasionally', 'Agnis', 'Quoyle', 'Bunny', 'up', 'letting', 'faade', 'crumble', 'away', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'school', 'teacher', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'little', 'boy', 'secret', 'past', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'good', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'Jason', 'Behr', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'many', 'others', 'round', 'cast', 'supporting', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'main', 'problems', 'story.There', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'problems', 'single', 'character', 'secret', 'past', 'problem', 'are', 'trying', 'hide', 'intended', 'give', 'characters', 'heft', 'something', 'allow', 'actor', 'emote', 'cases', 'when', 'single', 'character', 'story', 'soap', 'opera', 'Also', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'what', 'sort', 'emotion', 'should', 'feel', 'film', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'characters', 'then', 'almost', 'case', 'same', 'thing', 'were', 'laughing', 'dramatic', 'pinnacle', 'character', 'cases', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'laughing', 'things', 'way', 'made', 'feel', 'cheated', 'am', 'supposed', 'feel', 'emotion', 'character', 'thing', 'remembered', 'back', 'earlier', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'laughing', 'same', 'thing', 'Now', 'know', 'full', 'scope', 'problem/', 'secret/', 'etc.', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'it.I', 'think', 'problems', 'lie', 'squarely', 'shoulders', 'director', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'writer', 'Robert', 'Nelson', 'Jacobs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'do', 'so', 'consistently', 'robs', 'film', 'impact', 'only', 'guess', 'were', 'trying', 'alleviate', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Unfortunately', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'be', 'there', 'first', 'place', 'be', 'relieved', 'laugh', 'something', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'how', 'can', 'relieve', 'anything', 'beginning', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'visually', 'Quoyle', 'character', 'entire', 'life', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'film', 'up', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'carried', 'film.If', 'can', 'overlook', 'blatant', 'attempt', 'trying', 'win', 'Oscar', 'soap', 'opera', 'feel', 'film', 'are', 'good', 'performances', 'worth', 'catching', 'film', 'definitely', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'caught', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'do', 'recommend', 'performances']",The Shipping News

698064,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000640VK,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 12]","My three star review does not mean just three, but a negative three.  The film is good, but it hardly reaches the height of the director Lasse Hallstrom's other projects.  But, before you say something in return, let me explain.""The Shipping News"" has merits of its own, and that's clear from the beginning: its cast attached to the film, and the stunningly beautiful locations of Newfoundland.  Kevin Spacy is a good actor, I know, and he proves it with his heartfelt performance of Quoyle, a born loser, who finds his new life with his daughter.  Equally good is Julianne Moore, who is not afraid of showing her character's frail side with little make-up possible.  This film also boasts the participation of Judi Dench, Pete Postlethwaite, Scott Glenn, and Cate Blanchett.  Oh, and don't miss that Rhys Ifans can play a normal character, and he is good, too.And the story, simple as it is, has strong power to universally appeal to everyone's heart.  Quoyle of the protagonist redeems his lost dignity and love as a human being in the new situation given as a chance to him, writing ""The Shipping News"" for the local paper.  With the mystrious history of his family and the land itself, the story unfolds steadily, describing Quoyle's heart once hopelessly broken by his previous marriage.  And you see the beautiful, but stern nature of Newfoundland, which tests the personality of him and all people surrounding him.  Whatever you think of as a solemn drama about humanity, you find it here.However, as everyone knows, the critical responce to ""The Shipping News"" is not exactly kind so far, compared with excellent ""The Cider House Rules"" and lovely ""Chocolat.""  The reason is, as far as I can guess, very simple.  ""The Shipping News"" is too cold.  Not cold-hearted, but it LOOKS very cold.  Of course, it is shot in Newfoundland, but that's not the point.  The point is, we got no chance to get to the heart of each character -- Wavey, Agnis, Tert, Jack Buggit, Nutbeem.  We know they have their own past while the film introduces them to us, but not enough emotional power is charged before the film goes on.  What is worse is, the sorrows and pains of them seem to be thrown into the film without being connected to Quoyle's character, whose family has its own history to be revealed.  All these episodes look jumbled in the film, which, on top of  them, depicts a deadly car accident and a beheaded man's body.  The film, in other words, shows everything to confuse its point; it looks at the past and the present; looks at grim reality and mythical history.  But it doesn't look at its heart, people.Though her acting is superb, Cate Blanchett is given too short screen time in the film; her character, unfaithful, spitfire wife of Quoyle, is very much missed after she is gone, because, though her character is flawed much, the film knows what it wants to be while she is on the screen.  In ""The Cide House Rules"" and ""Chocolat,"" the principal characters knew what they were doing; they are also flawed, but they lived thier life, and their portraits suggested life-affirming attitudes, which have been respected director Hallstrom's trademark.This attitude, I am afraid, seems to be buried among the cold  nature of the locations.  We don't see people's life; instead, we see a glimpse of their past, which is all shady and dark.

The characters are set up so well that they seem to have come off the pages of the book. This is one movie that my husband and I never get tired of watching.We first visited Newfoundland in 2005. Then my husband decided we needed to buy a house up there and found one for less than the price of a used SUV. He had me go up, scope it out and we bought it. It is then that I became familiar with the hearty Newfies and the wonderful land thereof. The people are portrayed well in this movie.The last time I visited I picked up The Shipping News book at a local book store. At the airport I started reading it and laughing out loud. The characters in the book were just like the people I had left in the town of Trepassey, where our house is located. When I found out it was a movie, I couldn't wait to watch it.I was not disappointed. The only change from the book is that Quoyle does not have two kids, and while that bothered me for a bit, I got over it and now don't think about it when I watch the movie.

Well, it must have been a very thick book, as it seems he had way too much material out there. None of the characters were fully developed. We have Spacey whimpering around making baby-sounds and the tone of his voice was exactly as he spoke -under hypnosis in K-Pak . He actually , at times reminded me of a mentally challenged person, the way he carried himself, the way he walked and the way he talked. Granted he had some reason to act strange with a father like he had. Emotionally drained,he was! And I think the scene's with Pedal should have been dumped and the rescue of Jason Behr (Dennis Buggit) by his father Scott Glenn (Jack Buggit) woulf have made a more adventuresome footage.I felt like the house they were dragging over the ice-Come on-come on, shake it, lets go. And the scene with Judi Dench putting her brother's ashes down the one-seater in the out-house could sum-up my feelings regarding the whole film.The cinematography was spectacular, but there was way to much to deal with, and I laughed out-right when Scott Glenn came back to life after the sea claiming him as the curse of the Buggit's called for-as they were carting him off in the ambulance, he tells Jason,(Dennis) ""son ,I have broken the curse, and now you can have your fishing licence"", the camera catches Jason and the look on his face was not happiness.

The main shortcomings of the movie are what's lost in translation. The events seem compressed and rushed, taking place impossibly quickly compared to the book's spread-out pace. Anguish is brief and redemption seems relatively cheap; just wait around for a few scenes and everything will work out.Even if you haven't read the book, the movie may not be for you. Scott Glenn's Newfie accent lapses so often it's distracting. In fact, everyone's accent is distracting, and it makes it harder to take the characters seriously as people, not caricatures. And everything happens so quickly it's hard to summon enough emotional investment to care about the twists, when they happen.There are some redeeming qualities. The scenery is beautiful.
