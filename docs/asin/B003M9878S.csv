Don't be fooled.The acting is extremely unpleasant and I can't comment on the plot because there isn't one. Apparently who ever wrote this trash felt that, given enough blood and gore, no one would notice the lack of plot.Combine bad acting, worse camera work, and blatantly stolen scenes from Hammer films and you have a completely wasted effort.Believe me, do not take the raving reviews seriously like I did, this movie is a tremendous waste of your time.

Other, greater minds have figured this story out. I could make no sense of any of it. It had shades of Ken Russell's goofiness mixed w/ gothic stuff. Savini was in it for about a minute as a mythical character who flashed his cape around a lot. The main character was in the woods, then on a beach, then in a house, back in the woods, on the beach, etc. Wherever this thing was going, it took way too long to get there!

I could not even follow the plot because there really wasn't one. atleast one that I could understand. I bought it because Ingrid Pitt was in it and I enjoyed her performances in Countess Dracula and the vampire lovers. I am so disappointed with this so called horror movie.

Hammer movies had plots, however silly or sometimes trite with dramatic tension and some recognizable character development. That's why 30 years later people are still watching and enjoying these movies, especially the Dracula/Carmilla series. Sea of Dust is a disjointed mess. Trying to follow what's supposed to be going on, much less caring about the characters, is nearly impossible. Certainly one of the attractions of classic vampire movies is that they were sexy with or without the nudity of ""Lust for Dracula"" or ""Vampire Lovers"". Based on the original Dracula story, as the heroine is put in danger the tension builds. There is a sense of dread from the moment Dracula sees the picture of Harker's fiance. There is nothing either sexy or scary in Sea of Dust. You are left painfully watching a mish mash of pale gore and futile attempts at artsie editing. The makers of Sea of Dust, who must have been the ones to write the favorable review on Amazon, obviously had no idea what makes this kind of movie good. Even the inclusion of Ingrid Pitt is embarrassing as she appears only in a small part as a very old woman. A cheap trick to try to make a few sales on her name.
