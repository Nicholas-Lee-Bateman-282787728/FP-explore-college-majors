317969,A20VXYT5DL0ZC6,6302516994,"Amazon Customer ""Creator, Entrepreneur, Free ...","[0, 1]","Omen IV: The Awakening is the final sequel in the four-part original Omen saga. Although uneven in quality, as it more than occasionally stumbles into schlocky TV-movie awkwardness and clunky acting, especially in the first half, for Omen fans it is a worthy sequel which gets better as the movie develops. With a decent script, good story, and a pretty surprising story twist, the plot more than holds its own. Long-time Omen fans will relish the pure evil and familiar diabolical rhythm of the usual procession of victims, as the new Anti-Christ grows up and mows down anyone who stands in her way. But it's actually not what you think. Anyway, you'll have to see this one for yourself.This is by no means a perfect movie as the original Omen was (The Omen was one of the most original, groundbreaking, gripping and compelling horror films of all time), nor is it as skillfully rendered as Damien: Omen II, but it IS definitely worth seeing and quite entertaining. Make no mistake, this is a good movie, not a bad one as most reviewers say. The producers, the original team of Mace and Neufeld, wove in Jerry Goldsmith's scores from parts I & III, and Jonathan Sheffer's new additional soundtrack also has some nice sequences. There are also some good sub-plots in the story, like the detective played by veteran Michael Lerner hired to investigate the evil mystery for the step-mother; the former nun Sister Yvonne who goes from street hooker to born-again preacher Felicity, as well as some juicy Book of Revelation references to get your Biblical blood pumping. Actress Faye Grant is quite good as the step-mother Karen York who becomes increasingly devout and frantic as she unravels the unholy truth. All-in-all, Omen IV: The Awakening is definitely a must-see for anyone who enjoyed the first three movies.",5,Uneven Quality But Compelling Last Sequel of the Evil Omen Saga,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,1814,"['Omen', 'IV', 'Awakening', 'final', 'sequel', 'four-part', 'original', 'Omen', 'saga', 'uneven', 'quality', 'more', 'occasionally', 'schlocky', 'TV-movie', 'awkwardness', 'clunky', 'acting', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'Omen', 'fans', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'better', 'movie', 'decent', 'script', 'good', 'story', 'pretty', 'surprising', 'story', 'twist', 'plot', 'more', 'own', 'Long-time', 'Omen', 'fans', 'will', 'relish', 'pure', 'evil', 'familiar', 'diabolical', 'rhythm', 'usual', 'procession', 'victims', 'new', 'Anti-Christ', 'up', 'mows', 'down', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'actually', 'not', 'what', 'think', 'Anyway', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'one', 'yourself.This', 'perfect', 'movie', 'original', 'Omen', 'was', 'Omen', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'groundbreaking', 'gripping', 'compelling', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'skillfully', 'rendered', 'Damien', 'Omen', 'II', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'Make', 'mistake', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'one', 'most', 'reviewers', 'say', 'producers', 'original', 'team', 'Mace', 'Neufeld', 'wove', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'scores', 'parts', 'III', 'Jonathan', 'Sheffer', 'new', 'additional', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'nice', 'sequences', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'sub-plots', 'story', 'detective', 'played', 'veteran', 'Michael', 'Lerner', 'hired', 'investigate', 'evil', 'mystery', 'step-mother', 'former', 'nun', 'Sister', 'Yvonne', 'who', 'street', 'hooker', 'born-again', 'preacher', 'Felicity', 'as', 'well', 'juicy', 'Book', 'Revelation', 'references', 'get', 'Biblical', 'blood', 'pumping', 'Actress', 'Faye', 'Grant', 'quite', 'good', 'step-mother', 'Karen', 'York', 'who', 'increasingly', 'devout', 'frantic', 'unholy', 'truth', 'All-in-all', 'Omen', 'IV', 'Awakening', 'definitely', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'three', 'movies']",N/A

So fans were shcoked to learn that Fox put together a fourth chapter. But, sadly, the results were terrible. Having another Antichrist after Damien Thorn (who gets a special reference in this film) is just stupid. And it's very easy to see that this is just a cheap remake of the classic first chapter, not a sequel.Gene and Karen York (Michael Woods and Faye Grant) are wealthy attorneys who have everything they can hope for. Except a child. So they adopt a child with the aide of Sister Yvonne, a shady nurse. They choose a beautiful baby girl named Delia. What they don't know of is the child's mysterious path. One thing that makes this film not work but made the first one so eerie is that the evil roots of Delia are shown to early on. In the first film, Damien didn't start demonstrating his habit to cause terror until he turned 5. But Delia shows right from the beginnig when she scratches her mother's neck. But back to the plot. Terror strikes when the priest baptizes her mysteriously dies. Her father is soon elected state senator, and the father of Delia's school bully is decapitated. Delia then adopts a rottweiler. Then her nanny falls out a window. Then they hire another nanny comes knowing Delia's evil plans and aiding her. Then the main character gets shot. Sound familliar? All these events happend in the first chapter. Only here they're not scary.And that's not all. Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar - winning score is recycled here, and it just seems so out of place. The cinematography is just awful, and the acting is stiffer than a tree.

Everything about Omen IV: The Awakening is a rehash; it actually felt like I was in a cycle. Start first three films and then do all over again next three and so on. Obviously, I knew who the apostles of the girl, the Anti-Christ, were. Once again, I knew how the story was going to unfold. The worst part of enduring Omen IV: The Awakening is the bad acting. The father was the bland Mr. Fix-It-All while the mother was the ugly I-can't-wait-for-her-to-die gal. The way the mother character was constructed brought back all of the characters from the previous three films and done the same for the umpteenth time. Why can't somebody develop a new and different kind of a character? Ahh, forget it. Better yet, just don't make any more of those crap. I can't get over the sheer confounding idea of having a quack, excuse me...psychic, fair show in this movie. I wasn't sure, for a minute, which was worse: the quack fair show or the eyes of Delia. Yeah, of course, when somebody who steps barefoot in a sandbox with dozens of rattlesnakes, what did anyone think what was going to happen? Oh...she got bitten by bunch of rattlesnakes *rolling my eyes* How obvious was that? Gee whiz, I think I clearly saw that coming miles ahead. First half of the picture is your basic The Omen setup. Then the second half suffered from the worst acting imaginable from Michael Lerner who might be of Brad Dourif prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The way the movie ended was no shocker. In fact, the directors should have questioned themselves why they had to make the movie when it was basically the same movie as The Omen. I mean, what was new? To kill the Devil, don't you need the seven daggers, not the puny gun? I got to question the reason for bringing in Alexander, the baby, as the Devil. Having two devils in a picture, I still don't get it. It doesn't matter if the picture took the title Omen and passed itself as the fourth part of the series.

A number of strange deaths lead Mrs. York to suspect that there is something terribly wrong with her new daughter, but the truth is more horrifying than she could ever imagine! This ill-conceived rebirth of THE OMEN series wreaks of bad television, with comically overacted characters abound and plenty of artless direction. Nothing can be taken seriously in THE AWAKENING.

But this wasn't to be the very end. For in 1991, directors Diminque Othenin-Gerard (director of HALLOWEEN 5: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS) & Jorge Montesi brought this horrifying series to a close with OMEN IV: THE AWKENINGKAREN YORK (played by Faye Grant) and her husband, GENE (played by Michael Woods) are two attorneys, who have been trying to conceive a child, but they have had no such luck. They decide to adopt, where they learn of a new baby girl having just been born. They adopt this little infant and name her DELIA.During Delia's baptism, she begins crying histerically when the priest pours the holy water over Delia's head. Hours after her baptism, the priest dies mysteriously.Years later, Gene is elected congrassman. An eight-year-old DELIA YORK (played by Asia Vieira) is having trouble with kids at school and more deaths occur. Karen becomes suspicious of Delia's existence and decides to investigate after JO THUESON (played by Ann Hearn) is killed. She hires a private detective named EARL KNIGHT (played by Michael Lerner). He finds nothing on Delia's real parents, but he does find some information on a nun who handled the adoption of Delia. That nun is SISTER YVONNE (played by Megan Leitch). Megan left the Church to become a hooker and then she moved to North Carolina to become part of a cult.Knight reaches N. Carolina. He watches Sister Yvonne in action, until he shows her a picture of her and Delia, where panic breaks loose with two rattle snakes biting Yvonne and killing her. Knight's death follows in the same day by a wrecking ball at a construction sight.Karen is pregnant and has given birth to a baby boy named Alexander. A week after Alexander's birth, Karen goes to the doctor, who is a close friend of Karen and Gene's. She has received information that the doctor was involved with. She stabs his hand in order to get the truth out of him. He reveals that Delia's true father is...DAMIEN THORN. He also reveals that Delia has a twin brother that Deila, herself, was carrying. But earlier in the film, Delia fell off her horse and received a concussion, where the doctor removed the fetus and planted the fetus inside Karen. Karen was the surrogate mother for Delia's twin brother, who is also Damien's offspring. Therefor, Delia and Alexander of the son and daughter of Damien Thorn. Karen then learns that Gene is involved, protecting both Delia and Alexander, where she kills the doctor and runs on home.Karen finds her proof of Alexander's link to Delia and Damien by finding the 666 birthmark on the palm of his hand. She points a gun towards Delia and Alexander, but through Delia's trance, Karen turns the gun to her head and kills herself.I would have given this film two stars because it was not what I had hoped it would be. I gave it three stars for making an attempt, as well as mentioning Damien, only I wish they would have gone into more detail about Damien's history and identity.

Omen IV:The Awakening became one of the more earlier victims of tv films with unnecessary sequels spawned.  Fox Network, this time, attempted unsuccessfully to spawn more interested in the series and perhaps make a few bob out of this instalment.  The tagline-the terror continues is a very apt one concerning how bad this film actually is.Damien Thorne has been dead for over ten years.  Rather than attempting to bring back Damien, Fox decide to 'resurrect' the antichrist this time using a female protagonist to play the devil, a she devil if you will.  Two rich attorneys become proud parents of Delia Yorke.  Over time (just like Katherine Thorne experienced) Karen York realises all is not what it seems with her precious child.

317980,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,6302516994,Dave. K,"[6, 8]","10-years after the 3rd Omen movie, The Omen IV was the movie to restart the franchise and keep it going. But its movies like this are why we have so many remakes. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece of filmmaking, but I was expecting a fairly decent movie; something that would serve as a decent time killer. But what I got was one really, really bad movie. Omen IV starts off weak, but watchable, but than it just goes down and becomes a complete waste of time.The screenplay written by Brian Taggert wasn't very good, but not the worst I have come across. The script was weak and the biggest problem is it tries too hard to be like the original and it fails. The characters are fairly decent, but the script never really becomes much. The problem was the script just wasn't very interesting like I said the screenplay wasn't very good, but not the worst out there. But The Omen IV did have a weak script and there were more problems than just a weak script.Originally Dominique Othenin- Girard was hired to direct and he's best known for Halloween 5. Dominique is an interesting director. He's not very good, but he does have some decent ideas. Halloween 5 is seen as one of the weaker installments and I agree, but it's a guilty pleasure of mine and the movie had some good ideas, but Dominique Othenin- Girard isn't a good enough director to execute them. Though I will stand by the final act of that movie being very well-done with some good suspense and tension; I don't think Halloween 5 though is the waste of a film it's made out to be, it's a decent slasher with some good moments, but in no way is Dominique Othenin- Girard a good director, but he does have some decent ideas.Let's face it though Omen IV was made for cable TV and it's been 10-years since the last part Dominique is really the best you can get. Richard Donner who directed the original is out of the question and the odds of landing someone known for the horror genre or someone who is trying to make a name for themselves is also pretty much out of the question. Bottom line is you get what you pay for and Dominique Othenin- Girard is the best the franchise could do at this point.Even though the script was weak Omen IV could have been fairly decent with the right director and Dominique Othenin- Girard was clearly not the right director. There is no suspense or tension and the scenes meant to entice suspense instead come out laughable. Omen IV has a lot of un-intentional comedy. During production it was clear Dominique wasn't the right person for the job and reports are he quit, but he was actually replaced in favor of Jorge Montesi. I don't know who shot what, but it seems he came in with a couple of weeks left to try and salvage the mess that was Omen IV.Again I don't know who shot what, but too much blame cannot be put on Jorge Montesi; he didn't have time to really go over things there was no prep time and he can't reshoot any footage due to the movie would be going over schedule and over budget, which it was on it's way to begin with. Despite the weak script Omen IV could have been a decent flick, but the directing is so poor and also was poorly shot. There's no sense of pacing and again any of the scenes meant to be suspenseful come out really silly.About the only saving grace were the actors. Some people say the acting was bad, but I have to disagree. While the acting here isn't brilliant none of the performances were really bad and they make this movie slightly better than it should be, but when you have a hack filmmaker it's kinda tough to give a top notch performance. Faye Grant as Karen York is the most interesting character, but overall just doesn't work. Asia Vieira as Delia York is actually pretty good, but she comes across more as a spoiled brat than the spawn of the anti-Christ. I think Asia Vieira does deliver a good performance, but again she seems more of a spoiled brat than evil.After this movie the Omen franchise would be done until the remake was released in 2006. The Omen IV pretty much fails on every level, while the movie is never good it starts off watchable, but quickly becomes a total bore-fest. The cast is good, but very little else is. The Omen IV is poorly made and just not very interesting. The scenes with suspense and tension are laughable. Avoid this one and stick with the original. There's nothing worth watching here.",1,Movies like this are why we get so many remakes,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,4372,"['10-years', '3rd', 'Omen', 'movie', 'Omen', 'IV', 'was', 'movie', 'restart', 'franchise', 'keep', 'going', 'movies', 'are', 'why', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'remakes', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'masterpiece', 'filmmaking', 'was', 'expecting', 'fairly', 'decent', 'movie', 'something', 'would', 'serve', 'decent', 'time', 'killer', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'one', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'Omen', 'IV', 'weak', 'watchable', 'just', 'down', 'complete', 'waste', 'time.The', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Brian', 'Taggert', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'not', 'worst', 'have', 'come', 'script', 'was', 'weak', 'biggest', 'problem', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'original', 'characters', 'are', 'fairly', 'decent', 'script', 'never', 'really', 'becomes', 'much', 'problem', 'was', 'script', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'said', 'screenplay', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'not', 'worst', 'there', 'Omen', 'IV', 'did', 'have', 'weak', 'script', 'were', 'more', 'problems', 'just', 'weak', 'script.Originally', 'Dominique', 'Othenin-', 'Girard', 'was', 'hired', 'direct', 'best', 'known', 'Halloween', '5', 'Dominique', 'interesting', 'director', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'have', 'decent', 'ideas', '5', 'seen', 'one', 'weaker', 'installments', 'agree', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mine', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'ideas', 'Dominique', 'Othenin-', 'Girard', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'director', 'execute', 'will', 'stand', 'final', 'act', 'movie', 'being', 'very', 'well-done', 'good', 'suspense', 'tension', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Halloween', '5', 'though', 'waste', 'film', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'decent', 'slasher', 'good', 'moments', 'way', 'Dominique', 'Othenin-', 'Girard', 'good', 'director', 'have', 'decent', 'ideas.Let', 'face', 'Omen', 'IV', 'was', 'made', 'cable', 'TV', 'been', '10-years', 'last', 'part', 'Dominique', 'really', 'best', 'can', 'get', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'who', 'directed', 'original', 'question', 'odds', 'landing', 'someone', 'known', 'horror', 'genre', 'someone', 'who', 'trying', 'make', 'name', 'also', 'pretty', 'much', 'question', 'Bottom', 'line', 'get', 'what', 'pay', 'Dominique', 'Othenin-', 'Girard', 'best', 'franchise', 'could', 'do', 'point.Even', 'script', 'was', 'weak', 'Omen', 'IV', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'decent', 'right', 'director', 'Dominique', 'Othenin-', 'Girard', 'was', 'clearly', 'not', 'right', 'director', 'suspense', 'tension', 'scenes', 'meant', 'entice', 'suspense', 'instead', 'come', 'out', 'laughable', 'Omen', 'IV', 'lot', 'un-intentional', 'comedy', 'production', 'was', 'clear', 'Dominique', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'person', 'job', 'reports', 'are', 'quit', 'was', 'actually', 'replaced', 'favor', 'Jorge', 'Montesi', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'shot', 'what', 'came', 'couple', 'weeks', 'left', 'try', 'salvage', 'mess', 'was', 'Omen', 'IV.Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'shot', 'what', 'too', 'much', 'blame', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'Jorge', 'Montesi', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'really', 'go', 'over', 'things', 'there', 'was', 'prep', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reshoot', 'footage', 'due', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'going', 'schedule', 'budget', 'was', 'way', 'begin', 'weak', 'script', 'Omen', 'IV', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'flick', 'directing', 'so', 'poor', 'also', 'was', 'poorly', 'shot', 'sense', 'pacing', 'again', 'scenes', 'meant', 'be', 'suspenseful', 'come', 'out', 'really', 'silly.About', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'were', 'actors', 'people', 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'have', 'disagree', 'acting', 'here', ""n't"", 'brilliant', 'none', 'performances', 'were', 'really', 'bad', 'make', 'movie', 'slightly', 'better', 'should', 'be', 'when', 'have', 'hack', 'filmmaker', 'kinda', 'tough', 'give', 'top', 'notch', 'performance', 'Faye', 'Grant', 'Karen', 'York', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'overall', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'Asia', 'Vieira', 'Delia', 'York', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'across', 'more', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'spawn', 'anti-Christ', 'think', 'Asia', 'Vieira', 'deliver', 'good', 'performance', 'again', 'more', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'evil.After', 'movie', 'Omen', 'franchise', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'remake', 'was', 'released', '2006', 'Omen', 'IV', 'pretty', 'much', 'level', 'movie', 'never', 'good', 'watchable', 'quickly', 'total', 'bore-fest', 'cast', 'good', 'very', 'little', 'else', 'Omen', 'IV', 'poorly', 'made', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'suspense', 'tension', 'are', 'laughable', 'Avoid', 'one', 'stick', 'original', 'nothing', 'worth', 'watching', 'here']",N/A

The Antichrist is persistent.A nun turned prostitute then evangelical jesus-freak is tormented with the knowledge of helping to bring 'the evil' into the world; she prays to 'god' for forgiveness that she didn't kill the child when she had the chance. Mother Superior has a heart attack after slapping the holy sheizer out of the pre-nun, & a crucifix inverts during an agonizing supplication.Very early on, she shows signs of her 'wickedness' - scratching her mother across the cheek while still but an infant.As might be expected, her whole childhood is filled with a series of anomeles.While at school, a ...-disturbing little brat picks on little Delia for some undetermined reason, perhaps as an exercise in masochism. In a particularly memorable scene, the brat makes off with Delia's lunchbox, dumping the contents onto the floor, stamping on it while laughing idiotically. Well, Delia doesn't take kindly to this antagonistic gesture, & forthwith slams her lunchbox square across the brute's ugly mug - he just sits in the corner crying his little beady eyes out, after managing to strike little Delia. But she gets her revenge - the next day, during a break, Delia makes off with his lunch, & runs out to mount & climb a ladder leading to the roof. When she gets quite a ways up, the little pigface follows, & begins to climb, but lo & behold, he's afraid of heights!He ends up urinating all over himself in front of the whole class. Ah, sweet revenge...Next, babysitter selection comes along, & who manages to get the job, but a new-age flake / weakan type.One day, Delia comes in from playing, & notices the babysitter sitting in the kitchen with her mother, with a book displayed on the table, entitled, ""The Book of Light""; I paraphrase - ""It's all about healing, & crystals..."", ""And stupid junk!"" yells Delia, slamming the book on the floor. A truly wonderful scene.Another scene involves curious Delia inspecting the weakan's crystal necklace. Guess what? It turns black. As do all of the crystals in her drawer.Another incident involved the babysitter taking a shower, when all of a sudden, she sees an inverted cross appear in the steam on the mirror. Frightened, she finally employs one of her 'wippie' friends to 'feel the vibe' - well, he promptly becomes quite ill, almost smashing his car into Delia's 'mother's'.The weakan arranges to trick Delia into attending a weaker - blindlight convention, where all manner of occultnik idiocy is enacted. By & by, as Delia passes the different booths, the practitioners are horrified by her presence, much like rabbits in the face of a stalking predator, until she is finally sabotaged, & forced to take a Kirlian photograph, which develops quite predictably. Swirls of black & red paint, which denotes chaos.Eventually, one of the flame tossers ignites himself, which catches upon the roof of a booth, & soon, the whole place is a raging inferno, with Delia smirking in its wake.Eventually, Delia's 'mother' gets the 'xoid cooties', the paranoia bug, consulting priests & pastors about the rise of the Antichrist, the book of Revelations, etc.Finally, with the help of the 'lambs of god', she manages to justify her paranoia, & makes up her mind for infanticide. Not surprising, actually, considering that the judeo-xian god has been guilty of this atrocity twice {jeezwiz & Ezekiel's son Abraham - the latter, which was a cruel mind-scrambling joke}.The Detective helping her gets demolished, amidst a chorus of spechtral dark angels.The little nun finally finds relief by the fang, & the weaker is destoyed. The 'mother' stalks towards the bedroom, as Delia holds the infant; the 'mother' points her gun, the baby displays the characteristic 'Mark of the Beast', & then...?Overall, Omen 4 is very entertaining, without the demoralization.

It is not really a sequel. It tries to update the original story. Here, a young, married couple, Karen (Faye Grant) and Gene York (Michael Woods), who both happen to be well to do attorneys, are having a hard time conceiving. They go the adoption route, adopting a baby girl that they name Delia.As Delia (Asia Vieira) grows up, she seems to have a number of issues. Animals are afraid of her. Those who succeed in annoying her seem to run into a spot of trouble. They even die, as does her Nanny, who ends up impaling herself after she falls from a second story window. Delia then gets a new nanny who looks out for her interests. Sounds familiar? You are right! it sounds an awful lot like the plot of ""The Omen"". It has other similarities. Here, her father may not be ambassador to another country, but he runs for public office and is elected. Delia is confident that her father, who dotes on her, will be President one day. Delia is the apple of her father's eye. It is her mother who comes to think that she is the Antichrist.Unfortunately, the reality is that this film ends up being nothing like the original film upon which it is based. The plot becomes convoluted and ridiculous. In updating the story line, the writer brought in some new age gobbledegook that goes nowhere. The story, which starts out promisingly enough, degenerates into total absurdity and becomes unbelievable and downright laughable. Unlike the original, which was believable because of the subtlety that was employed through its straightforward presentation and deft direction, this film is anything but. Ham handedly directed and with a poor script with which to work, the actors cast never even had a chance.Don't buy this film.

317990,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,6302516994,Paperbackstash,"[1, 1]","Eager to cash in on the Omen name, the Fox big heads ignored the benefits of actually taking the time to create a good film. Instead they wanted to exploit the series and just bring in the dough. Big surprise there.For this film, surprisingly a movie made for TV - why on earth would anyone do that with this series?? - we get a little girl adopted by two parents desperately wanting a child. They take little Delia from a Catholic orphanage; this is followed by a bizarre a overdone scene where one of the nuns acts horrified and guilty. Time is taken to show unusual action from Delia, a difference from the original Omen. There they fast forwarded to Damien at older ages; here they try and show Delia making the mother unwary from the get go.One different, and obvious change, is that the villain is female and the person attempting to bring her down a woman as well. Strange change but oh well. I heard this was supposed to be a remake of sorts but after viewing the film I see it was not. The ending explains this. Either way, it didn't work and ended up finalizing the series on a negative note, much like the Alien series with Resurrection.There are multiple repulsions that stand out in this film, but the first that comes to mind is poor acting. Delia (Asia Vieira) is a child who has serious issues, in both character form and acting wise. She overdoes much, and if she were killed brutally in this film, I think clapping would have followed. Faye Grant plays the mother, an over anxious woman who really needs to stand up to her husband more. Michael Woods is the naive hubby in question, someone who needs to either listen to his wife or open his eyes. Ann Hearn as the new age Nanny was barf-inducing. Her characters motivations didn't make sense. If she found the child evil, why would she stay, especially after the new age convention incident?  Her attitude irritated me, and Hearn played it the best she could with the god-awful material handed to her. Jim Byrnes as the feminine new age companion didn't succeed much more than the others. Michael Lerner as the private eye DID do well, though, and his subplot was about the only interesting thing in this story.The score is also very poor. Jerry Goldsmith rocked my world with his original music for the films; here it was sadly slaughtered by John Scheffer. The result was grossly embarrassing. Just hearing it let me know what I would soon be in for.The plot itself doesn't make much sense and is rather pointless. Where did all this new age shit come from? The original Omen and its brothers had nothing to do with this crap and for good reason. Instead of focusing on the religion this films really about, they inserted these new age nutcases whose only talent was to make big eyes at any news. The scene at the carnival was particularly hilarious. Delia and everyone's overacting was too lame to even comment much on without getting sick.Instead of being subtle and psychologically dependent, this film focused more on in your face tactics that a kindergartener could figure out. Obvious from the get go and not at all 'mild', the scenes were over the top. I was particularly annoyed with the evilness of Delia set up at the school. Oooh so she doesn't get along with a fellow classmate? Opening up a kindergarten class of actors isn't a good thing, seriously, as it's rare to find a child actor in a horror movie who does a good job. They're really pushing it with an entire group; if they had all been offed I wouldn't have been unhappy.The plots pacing isn't bad, but no one cares. The directing is bland and mild and nothing else is offered. The deaths were not as cool as its predecessors, but the snake bite scene attack did give me shivers. I suspect that's more from my personal fear of rattlers though. The ending, in particular, didn't make much sense. Can we say stupid? I wont spoil it here but if you really are enough of an Omen fan to see this flick and be a completist, you'll see the details for yourself. Just don't say I didn't warn you.It is not surprising that this is only available in the Region 1 Omen box set. I heard it is not sold separately and I see why; it's probably something that would only be gotten rid of if given away.

However, all is not well in the world as Damien fathered a child before his death, a girl, who has inhabited Damien's evil ways and thirst for world domination and death. The little girl, Delia, played superbly by child actress Asia Viera, is chilling and morbid in her performance, as the viewer almost believes she is truely possessed by satan.
