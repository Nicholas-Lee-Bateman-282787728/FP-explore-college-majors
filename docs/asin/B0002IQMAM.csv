836321,A3OT9T1VKYVC2E,B0002IQMAM,,"[4, 4]","I got a copy of The Punisher on Blu-Ray for Christmas.  I already had a Standard Format copy I picked up from Costco (which also includes an audio CD disk with 3 tracks from the movie).  So this is just reviewing the 2 formats.There are NO extras on the Blu-ray. NONE! ZERO! ZELCH!!!The Standard Format release comes with a good contingent of extras.  Here is an amended version of what another reviewer, mirasreviews of McLean, VA, wrote back in 2004 of the Extras on the Standard Format release:""This is a nicely loaded disc. Bonus features include 4 featurettes, 2 deleted scenes with director's commentary, a music video for ""Step Up"" by Drowning Pool, a trailer for ""The Punisher"" video game, and an audio commentary by director Jonathan Hensleigh. The first featurette, ""Keepin' it Real"" (25 minutes) is about the film's stunts. The second featurette, ""War Journal"" (30 minutes) is a broad making-of documentary that takes us through pre-production, production, editing and scoring in post-production, and winds up at the film's premiere. The third featurette, ""Army of One"" (12 minutes) is about ""The Punisher""'s comic book origins. The last featurette, ""Drawing Blood Bradstreet Style"" (5 minutes) focuses on cover artist Tim Bradstreet, who also designed the film's theatrical posters and heavily influenced the movie's visual style. The film's audio commentary by director Jonathan Hensleigh is very good. He speaks clearly and doesn't meander when explaining the decisions he made concerning story, style, characters and cinematography.""The Blu-ray picture quality is slightly better than the up scaled to 1080i my player gives me on my 42"" Plasma, but not enough to merit the purchase of a stripped down Blu-ray disk.  Maybe you could tell the difference on a 50"" or larger screen.  The sound is 6.1 instead of the Standards 5.1 and I hear no difference at all through my Bose system.There is also an extended version on Standard Format (140 min. vs 123min.) which isn't on the Blu-ray either.  Do I smell another marketing scam of buy yet another Blu-ray for the extended cut with the extras if say ""War Zone"" does well coming???Bottom line: I have limited shelf space and having now viewed both Formats, the Blu-ray is the one going to Charity!!  I'll keep the Standard Format for myself.",4,Don't bother buying the Blu-ray,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,2302,"['got', 'copy', 'Punisher', 'Blu-Ray', 'Christmas', 'already', 'had', 'Standard', 'Format', 'copy', 'picked', 'up', 'Costco', 'also', 'audio', 'CD', 'disk', '3', 'tracks', 'movie', 'just', 'reviewing', '2', 'are', 'NO', 'extras', 'Blu-ray', 'NONE', 'ZERO', 'ZELCH', 'Standard', 'Format', 'release', 'good', 'contingent', 'extras', 'Here', 'amended', 'version', 'what', 'reviewer', 'mirasreviews', 'McLean', 'VA', 'wrote', 'back', '2004', 'Extras', 'Standard', 'Format', 'release', 'nicely', 'loaded', 'disc', 'Bonus', 'include', '4', 'featurettes', '2', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'commentary', 'music', 'video', 'Step', 'Up', 'Drowning', 'Pool', 'trailer', 'Punisher', 'video', 'game', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Hensleigh', 'first', 'featurette', 'Keepin', 'Real', '25', 'minutes', 'film', 'stunts', 'second', 'featurette', 'War', 'Journal', '30', 'minutes', 'broad', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'pre-production', 'production', 'editing', 'scoring', 'post-production', 'up', 'film', 'premiere', 'third', 'featurette', 'Army', 'One', '12', 'minutes', 'Punisher', 'comic', 'book', 'origins', 'last', 'featurette', 'Drawing', 'Blood', 'Bradstreet', 'Style', '5', 'minutes', 'cover', 'artist', 'Tim', 'Bradstreet', 'who', 'also', 'designed', 'film', 'theatrical', 'posters', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'movie', 'visual', 'style', 'film', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Hensleigh', 'very', 'good', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'meander', 'when', 'explaining', 'decisions', 'made', 'concerning', 'story', 'style', 'characters', 'cinematography', 'Blu-ray', 'picture', 'quality', 'slightly', 'better', 'up', 'scaled', '1080i', 'player', '42', 'Plasma', 'not', 'enough', 'merit', 'purchase', 'stripped', 'Blu-ray', 'disk', 'Maybe', 'could', 'tell', 'difference', '50', 'larger', 'screen', 'sound', '6.1', 'instead', 'Standards', '5.1', 'hear', 'difference', 'Bose', 'system.There', 'also', 'extended', 'version', 'Standard', 'Format', '140', 'min', 'vs', '123min', ""n't"", 'Blu-ray', 'either', 'Do', 'smell', 'marketing', 'scam', 'buy', 'yet', 'Blu-ray', 'extended', 'cut', 'extras', 'say', 'War', 'Zone', 'well', 'coming', 'Bottom', 'line', 'have', 'limited', 'shelf', 'space', 'having', 'now', 'viewed', 'Formats', 'Blu-ray', 'one', 'going', 'Charity', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'Standard', 'Format']",N/A

836324,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002IQMAM,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 3]","Frank Castle has a decent life.  He has a family that loves him, a wife that will follow him to the ends of the Earth, and a son that looks up to him.  On the night of his retirement, he is involved with a shooting dealing with the youngest son of Howard Saint.  Not thinking twice about the death, he retires and heads to the beach to celebrate his first extended family reunion in five years.  Unfortunately, Howard Saint is not one to let the death of his son go forgotten.  He sends a group of men down to the island to kill all of Castle's family.  They proceed to take everything from Frank, and even try to end his life as well, but luckily he is a fighter, and survives the assassination attempt.  This action brings upon the birth of a man hell-bent on revenging his family, a survivor known as, the Punisher.What follows next are massive amounts of explosions, witty and cheesy catch-phrases, and an exploration of what goes bump in those dark alleyways. Director Jonathan Hensleigh has done an exceptional job of bringing the darkness to the silver screen.  Castle is a tragic figure, his family has been killed, and he wants to bring ""punishment"" to those that viciously did this to his life.  He is not a happy character.  He does not have joy surrounding him and Hensleigh stays true to that.  There are several scenes in this film where we could have seen a bubbly Hollywood side to Castle.  Some directors would have gone another direction to perhaps give us a glimpse of his decency, but Hensleigh never went there.  He keeps Castle mysterious and void of emotion.  He has feelings, but that does not sway his thoughts on vengeance.  I was proud of this film for keeping true to the character.  There were some beautiful scenes that were used in this film that just made me as giddy as a schoolgirl.  One of my favorite scenes is when Castle uses a razor edge to chop one of his assailants.  The way he held the weapon and the camera angle truly brought out the style of the comic.The Punisher is not a superhero.  He is a normal person that will bleed when shot, and feel pain when hit ... he is human.  That is something that I wanted to make sure would be seen in this film, and it was.  I did not want the Punisher to be a superhero that could dodge bullets and cause damage with his single fist, and thankfully this was not the direction that Hensleigh took him.  There were several scenes where Castle was shot, where he couldn't move because he was in pain, and where he drank way too much.  This was a story of man who was willing to go to the full extreme to bring vengeance to his family.  He represented the decision that each one of us considers when hurt by another.  He is an average man that is fueled by love and hate.  In fact, that was what I felt about this film.  I loved it and hated it.  There were moments when I felt embarrassed for the cast, wondering if they knew what they were saying and doing, but most of these scenes were countered with amazing shots that built a beautifully gritty story to this powerful human.Overall, it was decent to watch.  Not one that I would watch again and again, but one that I wouldn't mind seeing the sequel if it is ever released.Grade:  *** out of ****",4,Those who do evil to others will come to know me well.,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,3231,"['Frank', 'Castle', 'decent', 'life', 'family', 'wife', 'will', 'follow', 'ends', 'Earth', 'son', 'up', 'night', 'retirement', 'involved', 'shooting', 'dealing', 'youngest', 'son', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'Not', 'thinking', 'twice', 'death', 'heads', 'beach', 'celebrate', 'first', 'extended', 'family', 'reunion', 'five', 'years', 'Unfortunately', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'not', 'one', 'let', 'death', 'son', 'go', 'forgotten', 'group', 'men', 'down', 'island', 'kill', 'Castle', 'family', 'proceed', 'take', 'everything', 'Frank', 'even', 'try', 'end', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'luckily', 'fighter', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'action', 'birth', 'man', 'hell-bent', 'revenging', 'family', 'survivor', 'known', 'Punisher.What', 'next', 'are', 'massive', 'amounts', 'explosions', 'witty', 'cheesy', 'catch-phrases', 'exploration', 'what', 'bump', 'dark', 'alleyways', 'Director', 'Jonathan', 'Hensleigh', 'done', 'exceptional', 'job', 'bringing', 'darkness', 'silver', 'screen', 'Castle', 'tragic', 'figure', 'family', 'been', 'killed', 'bring', 'punishment', 'viciously', 'did', 'life', 'not', 'happy', 'character', 'not', 'have', 'joy', 'surrounding', 'Hensleigh', 'true', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'film', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'bubbly', 'Hollywood', 'side', 'Castle', 'directors', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'direction', 'perhaps', 'give', 'glimpse', 'decency', 'Hensleigh', 'never', 'went', 'there', 'Castle', 'mysterious', 'void', 'emotion', 'feelings', 'not', 'sway', 'thoughts', 'vengeance', 'was', 'proud', 'film', 'keeping', 'true', 'character', 'were', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'were', 'used', 'film', 'just', 'made', 'giddy', 'schoolgirl', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'when', 'Castle', 'razor', 'edge', 'chop', 'one', 'assailants', 'way', 'held', 'weapon', 'camera', 'angle', 'truly', 'brought', 'out', 'style', 'comic.The', 'Punisher', 'not', 'superhero', 'normal', 'person', 'will', 'bleed', 'when', 'shot', 'feel', 'pain', 'when', 'hit', 'human', 'something', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'Punisher', 'be', 'superhero', 'could', 'dodge', 'bullets', 'cause', 'damage', 'single', 'fist', 'thankfully', 'was', 'not', 'direction', 'Hensleigh', 'took', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'Castle', 'was', 'shot', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'move', 'was', 'pain', 'where', 'drank', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'go', 'full', 'extreme', 'bring', 'vengeance', 'family', 'represented', 'decision', 'one', 'considers', 'when', 'hurt', 'average', 'man', 'fueled', 'love', 'hate', 'fact', 'was', 'what', 'felt', 'film', 'loved', 'hated', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'felt', 'embarrassed', 'cast', 'wondering', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'doing', 'most', 'scenes', 'were', 'countered', 'amazing', 'shots', 'built', 'beautifully', 'gritty', 'story', 'powerful', 'human.Overall', 'was', 'decent', 'watch', 'Not', 'one', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'sequel', 'ever', 'released.Grade', '***', '****']",N/A

But The punisher is a film that we can all relate to, spider man  at times has to be an inosint film so that younger children can see it. the punisher throws all that away so that you can really see what it would be like for a man who has lost it all. Spider man is great and exceeds in terms of visual affects and special effects and overall action because it had a greater production budget of 200 million dollars. But the punisher looks incredibly great at only a 33 million dollar budget. You have to admit that they had a better team working on the punisher than Spider man.

After all this film was pure punishment to watch.  The pacing of the movie is screwy.  It starts slow and you have the feel that every character that is about to be introduced will die anyway so why bother.  Their is also no chemistry between the husband and wife.  You are actually rooting for the punisher to leave his wife and his kid.  After all he has been under deep cover for two years and has had  no contact with his family.  Now I've been on a hell of a lot of military deployments and family's rarely stay together after a forced seperation like this.  Take into the account that he has done this several times and you have a cast that doesn't know how to act together in a realistic matter.The matterial is also dated.  Vigilante justice is so 80's.  A hero is also only as good as his villian.  Travolta's character never seams to be an evil ""king pin"" type.  He is just a business man with both legal and illegal ventures.  Going ballistic since Travolta launders money and sells guns never set right.  If this man was truely evil I.E.:  terrorism, drugs, child porn, snuff etc . . .  Then you would be rooting for the punisher all the way.

836331,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B0002IQMAM,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[0, 0]","""Willing suspension of disbelief"" is what you must tell yourself, before and especially during the first 20 mins or so of this movie. This is the dark side of Marvel comics characters, a sort of nasty Doberman they keep out of sight when friends are visiting, but want to have around for less welcome characters. Thomas Jane (probably best remembered as the brooding shark wrangler in Deep Blue Sea) does a pretty good job portraying what is probably one of the most difficult and grounded Marvel hero's (I use the term loosely). He is first and foremost a victim, turned vigilante, bringing restitution to those who have escaped the law. The twisted morality card is played LARGE here, as Travolta heads up a pretty vicious organized crime mob, who murder the entire family of our hero, during a family reunion. A few more sadistic scenes reinforce in the viewer the need for these baddies to die summarily, and horribly where possible, as they have worn out any votes of sympathy with the audience. Overall, it's a very dark, at times extremely violent, but enjoyable drama. Yes, I said drama, and that point is probably the paradoxical weakness of the movie. He's a man, he bleeds, he can die, he has no cape, and he certainly can't fly. However, he can survive severe beatings, bullet wounds, stabbing, fire and explosions, and still bounce back with a grimace, and his own small arms factory (remember what I said about suspension of disbelief). If I had to make a criticism, it would be that paradox - the very shaky walking between two genres, that almost, but not quite comes off. On the one hand, this is an adult themed violent revenge movie with attitude, on the other it's a Marvel character romp complete with unlikely characters, and some very misplaced dialogue. Jane looks the part at least, and spends most of the movie sulking inside a whisky bottle, when he's not killing villians which actually makes you feel for his character more than you would expect. Not too many surprises, but good CGI, good support cast, great stuntwork, and tight script make this 3.5, but not quite 4 stars. DVD has 4 featurettes that are well worth a look, as well as usual deleted scenes, commentary and trailers etc. Enjoy!",4,Marvel's Sombre Side,1094688000,"09 9, 2004",2004,2223,"['Willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'what', 'must', 'tell', 'especially', 'first', '20', 'mins', 'so', 'movie', 'dark', 'side', 'Marvel', 'comics', 'characters', 'sort', 'nasty', 'Doberman', 'keep', 'sight', 'when', 'friends', 'are', 'visiting', 'want', 'have', 'around', 'less', 'welcome', 'characters', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'probably', 'best', 'remembered', 'brooding', 'shark', 'wrangler', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'what', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'grounded', 'Marvel', 'hero', 'use', 'term', 'loosely', 'first', 'foremost', 'victim', 'turned', 'vigilante', 'bringing', 'restitution', 'who', 'have', 'escaped', 'law', 'twisted', 'morality', 'card', 'played', 'LARGE', 'here', 'Travolta', 'up', 'pretty', 'vicious', 'organized', 'crime', 'mob', 'who', 'murder', 'entire', 'family', 'hero', 'family', 'reunion', 'few', 'more', 'sadistic', 'scenes', 'reinforce', 'viewer', 'need', 'baddies', 'die', 'summarily', 'horribly', 'where', 'possible', 'have', 'worn', 'out', 'votes', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'Overall', 'very', 'dark', 'times', 'extremely', 'violent', 'enjoyable', 'drama', 'Yes', 'said', 'drama', 'point', 'probably', 'paradoxical', 'weakness', 'movie', 'man', 'can', 'die', 'cape', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fly', 'However', 'can', 'survive', 'severe', 'beatings', 'bullet', 'wounds', 'stabbing', 'fire', 'explosions', 'still', 'bounce', 'back', 'grimace', 'own', 'small', 'arms', 'factory', 'remember', 'what', 'said', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'had', 'make', 'criticism', 'would', 'be', 'paradox', 'very', 'shaky', 'walking', 'two', 'genres', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'off', 'one', 'hand', 'adult', 'themed', 'violent', 'revenge', 'movie', 'attitude', 'other', 'Marvel', 'character', 'romp', 'complete', 'unlikely', 'characters', 'very', 'misplaced', 'dialogue', 'Jane', 'part', 'least', 'most', 'movie', 'sulking', 'whisky', 'bottle', 'when', 'not', 'killing', 'villians', 'actually', 'feel', 'character', 'more', 'would', 'expect', 'Not', 'too', 'many', 'surprises', 'good', 'CGI', 'good', 'support', 'cast', 'great', 'stuntwork', 'tight', 'script', 'make', '3.5', 'not', 'quite', '4', 'stars', 'DVD', '4', 'featurettes', 'are', 'well', 'look', 'as', 'well', 'usual', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'trailers', 'etc', 'Enjoy']",N/A
836332,A928WN8NV03WZ,B0002IQMAM,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[2, 2]","The Punisher has been done before, but it wasn't much of a success.  The Dolph Lundgren version was popular only for its campy aspects and unrealistic gunfights.  This is a movie close to the early and middle eras of the comic book.  It is dark, gritty, ugly at times, and witha  joyless obsessed main character.  The thing that set apart the Punisher from other Marvel heroes is his lack of morals when dealing with evil.  With Daredevil he came from a dark place but had a code to never kill.  Spiderman, though scarred at a young age, still kept his hope and wouldn't kill.  Punisher went through his traumatic experience, and came out as a killer.  Not a man of justice, but a punisher of evil.Frank Castle is an FBI agent in this movie version.  He is involved as an undercover agent in a weapons scheme playing a german with connection to interested foreign parties.  Things seem to go off without a hitch until the foreign parties get nervous when the police show up and open fire on the American dealers, one of them is killed.  The only problem is that the person killed is connected.  His father is Howard Saint, a crime boss focused on money laundering.  He and his wife are crushed by the death his son, and he wants revenge, the wife wants the entire family killed.  So they send a group of hitmen that accomplish this task, save for Frank Castle, who manages to survive and swears revenge.This isn't the typical comic book movie.  The theme is a lot darker than most.  Though he has a trio of nutty neighbors in the trashy apartment he rents, the feeling of the movie is joyless and bleak.  The Saints live in their luxurious mansion but don't seem in the slightest bit happy.  Howard Saint is in luxury but jealously guards everything he has and sufferes from mild paranoia.  His wife seems to make the best out of it but lives under her husbands constant scrutiny.  His son is a fop and not the favorite who was killed.  His neighbors though quirky and friendly seem to be either down on their luck or are losers.  The gun fights aren't John Woo style action sequences, they are quick and ugly executions.But the movie does keep the feel of a comic book.  The two assasins are gimic light, but could easily be in a comic.  The first a blues singer/assasin.  The second the russian, played by a former pro wrestler, a massive assasin that beats his victims to death and has a massive tolerence to pain.  But that is as close to other comics as it got.  Early on it had cameos by superheroes and villians, but middle and later era was flat out standard fare villians; gangsters, drug dealers, terrorists, etc....The acting is good all around.  Frank Castle is downplayed and intense as he was in the comic.  John Travolta was excellent as Howard Saint.  A powerful man that in the center is very weak and insecure.  Willing to kill close friends out of jealousy with little or weak evidence.  His wife Livia Saint, a spoiled woman making the best of her rich cage and possesive husband, but the perfect American aristocrat, arrogant, mean spirited, and looking down at all those around her.This is a very decent movie, better than some of the comic adaptations of late.  Don't expect a happy movie or something with an upbeat ending.  Even when all the bad guys are killed there is a feeling that nothing has changed.  Yes he punished the guilty, but he has nothing in the end.  Family is gone, friends are gone, even money means nothing to him.  But still creates a good movie, albeit dark and having little in the realms of hope.",4,Dark tale of the classic vigalante,1095292800,"09 16, 2004",2004,3545,"['Punisher', 'been', 'done', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'success', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'version', 'was', 'popular', 'only', 'campy', 'aspects', 'unrealistic', 'gunfights', 'movie', 'close', 'early', 'middle', 'eras', 'comic', 'book', 'dark', 'gritty', 'ugly', 'times', 'witha', 'joyless', 'obsessed', 'main', 'character', 'thing', 'set', 'apart', 'Punisher', 'other', 'Marvel', 'heroes', 'lack', 'morals', 'when', 'dealing', 'evil', 'Daredevil', 'came', 'dark', 'place', 'had', 'code', 'never', 'kill', 'Spiderman', 'though', 'scarred', 'young', 'age', 'still', 'kept', 'hope', 'would', ""n't"", 'kill', 'went', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'came', 'out', 'killer', 'Not', 'man', 'justice', 'punisher', 'evil.Frank', 'Castle', 'FBI', 'agent', 'movie', 'version', 'involved', 'undercover', 'agent', 'weapons', 'scheme', 'playing', 'german', 'connection', 'interested', 'foreign', 'parties', 'Things', 'seem', 'go', 'off', 'hitch', 'foreign', 'parties', 'get', 'nervous', 'when', 'police', 'show', 'up', 'open', 'fire', 'American', 'dealers', 'one', 'killed', 'only', 'problem', 'person', 'killed', 'connected', 'father', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'crime', 'boss', 'focused', 'money', 'laundering', 'wife', 'are', 'crushed', 'death', 'son', 'revenge', 'wife', 'entire', 'family', 'killed', 'send', 'group', 'hitmen', 'accomplish', 'task', 'save', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'who', 'survive', 'swears', 'revenge.This', ""n't"", 'typical', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'theme', 'lot', 'darker', 'most', 'trio', 'nutty', 'neighbors', 'trashy', 'apartment', 'feeling', 'movie', 'joyless', 'bleak', 'Saints', 'live', 'luxurious', 'mansion', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'slightest', 'bit', 'happy', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'luxury', 'jealously', 'guards', 'everything', 'sufferes', 'mild', 'paranoia', 'wife', 'make', 'best', 'husbands', 'constant', 'scrutiny', 'son', 'fop', 'not', 'favorite', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'neighbors', 'quirky', 'friendly', 'seem', 'be', 'either', 'down', 'luck', 'are', 'losers', 'gun', 'fights', 'are', ""n't"", 'John', 'Woo', 'style', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'quick', 'ugly', 'executions.But', 'movie', 'keep', 'feel', 'comic', 'book', 'two', 'assasins', 'are', 'gimic', 'light', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'comic', 'first', 'blues', 'singer/assasin', 'second', 'russian', 'played', 'former', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'massive', 'assasin', 'victims', 'death', 'massive', 'tolerence', 'pain', 'as', 'close', 'other', 'comics', 'got', 'Early', 'had', 'cameos', 'superheroes', 'villians', 'middle', 'later', 'era', 'was', 'flat', 'out', 'standard', 'fare', 'villians', 'gangsters', 'drug', 'dealers', 'terrorists', 'etc', '.The', 'acting', 'good', 'around', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'downplayed', 'intense', 'was', 'comic', 'John', 'Travolta', 'was', 'excellent', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'powerful', 'man', 'center', 'very', 'weak', 'insecure', 'Willing', 'kill', 'close', 'friends', 'jealousy', 'little', 'weak', 'evidence', 'wife', 'Livia', 'Saint', 'spoiled', 'woman', 'making', 'best', 'rich', 'cage', 'possesive', 'husband', 'perfect', 'American', 'aristocrat', 'arrogant', 'mean', 'spirited', 'looking', 'down', 'her.This', 'very', 'decent', 'movie', 'better', 'comic', 'adaptations', 'late', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'happy', 'movie', 'something', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'Even', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'killed', 'feeling', 'nothing', 'changed', 'punished', 'guilty', 'nothing', 'end', 'Family', 'gone', 'friends', 'are', 'gone', 'even', 'money', 'nothing', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'dark', 'having', 'little', 'realms', 'hope']",N/A
836333,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B0002IQMAM,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[1, 3]","Audiences have become so accustomed to being overloaded by CGI effects in recent comic book adaptations that the idea of a tougher, leaner approach seemed to catch viewers and critics off-guard, when this latest adaptation of ""The Punisher"" premiered. Sadly, most critics chose to ignore the very qualities that made this film so special, never accepting that the story is closer in spirit to ""Sin City"" than ""Spider-Man"" or ""Daredevil"". Now that the film is available on DVD, I invite everyone to take a second look at this dark tale of the fine line one man walks between Justice and Vengeance...you may be surprised by how good it really is! The film is carefully constructed to allow viewers an opportunity to see dedicated undercover cop Frank Castle in action, and to understand the caring, loving family man Frank Castle was...before mob boss Howard Saint, and his equally ruthless wife, Livia (played by a remarkably low-key John Travolta and Laura Harring), takes vengeance for their son's death by ordering the brutal execution of Castle's entire family. As conceived, with total conviction, by Thomas Jane, Castle is so completely traumatized that he 'lets go' of what remained of his compassion, and becomes a human weapon, devoid of pity, living only to see justice done, in equal measure to the crime.This is not someone you can easily 'warm up' to, and as the movie evolves into a series of executions, you may actually start to feel more sympathy toward the Saints and their henchman, Quentin Glass (the ever-watchable Will Patton) than in Castle. But screenwriter Michael France, and co-writer and director Jonathan Hensleigh, both well-versed in the Marvel comic character, add three quirky 'innocents' (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Ben Foster, and John Pinette), who Castle warms up to, somewhat, and must ultimately protect. He will never recover the compassion that he lost, but he realizes that for many being brutalized, he is the only hope they have, giving him a purpose to live for.Unlike the earlier, Dolph Lundgren ""Punisher"", hampered by a minuscule budget and two-dimensional acting, this version makes the most of its small budget, with first-class acting (including a VERY welcome cameo by Roy Scheider), incredible stunt and pyrotechnic work, and a storyline that offers far more depth than you might expect in a comic book adaptation.I sincerely hope a sequel is made, as this will be a film that will grow in stature as audiences realize how good it actually is!",5,an amazing performance by Thomas Jane,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,2491,"['Audiences', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'accustomed', 'being', 'overloaded', 'CGI', 'effects', 'recent', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'idea', 'tougher', 'leaner', 'approach', 'seemed', 'catch', 'viewers', 'critics', 'off-guard', 'when', 'latest', 'adaptation', 'Punisher', 'premiered', 'Sadly', 'most', 'critics', 'chose', 'ignore', 'very', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'special', 'never', 'accepting', 'story', 'closer', 'spirit', 'Sin', 'City', 'Spider-Man', 'Daredevil', 'Now', 'film', 'available', 'DVD', 'invite', 'everyone', 'take', 'second', 'look', 'dark', 'tale', 'fine', 'line', 'one', 'man', 'Justice', 'Vengeance', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'really', 'film', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'allow', 'viewers', 'opportunity', 'see', 'dedicated', 'undercover', 'cop', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'action', 'understand', 'caring', 'loving', 'family', 'man', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'was', 'mob', 'boss', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'equally', 'ruthless', 'wife', 'Livia', 'played', 'remarkably', 'low-key', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'vengeance', 'son', 'death', 'ordering', 'brutal', 'execution', 'Castle', 'entire', 'family', 'conceived', 'total', 'conviction', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Castle', 'so', 'completely', 'traumatized', 'go', 'what', 'remained', 'compassion', 'human', 'weapon', 'devoid', 'pity', 'living', 'only', 'see', 'justice', 'done', 'equal', 'measure', 'crime.This', 'not', 'someone', 'can', 'easily', ""'warm"", 'up', 'movie', 'series', 'executions', 'may', 'actually', 'start', 'feel', 'more', 'sympathy', 'Saints', 'henchman', 'Quentin', 'Glass', 'ever-watchable', 'Will', 'Patton', 'Castle', 'screenwriter', 'Michael', 'France', 'co-writer', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Hensleigh', 'well-versed', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'character', 'add', 'three', 'quirky', ""'innocents"", 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'John', 'Pinette', 'who', 'Castle', 'somewhat', 'must', 'ultimately', 'protect', 'will', 'never', 'recover', 'compassion', 'lost', 'many', 'being', 'brutalized', 'only', 'hope', 'have', 'giving', 'purpose', 'live', 'earlier', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Punisher', 'hampered', 'minuscule', 'budget', 'two-dimensional', 'acting', 'version', 'most', 'small', 'budget', 'first-class', 'acting', 'including', 'VERY', 'welcome', 'cameo', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'incredible', 'stunt', 'pyrotechnic', 'work', 'storyline', 'far', 'more', 'depth', 'might', 'expect', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation.I', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'sequel', 'made', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'will', 'grow', 'stature', 'audiences', 'realize', 'how', 'good', 'actually']",N/A

The first one was The Punisher, second was Man on Fire. I managed to catch the Punisher in Theaters but missed Man on Fire. But of course I eventually saw that one too and did not think it was that great. The Punisher, I believe was the better of the two. I will admit that when I saw this movie in theaters 2 years ago, I loved it. I wrote a review right away and gave it 5 stars. I even waited eagerly for its DVD release that year and purchased it almost right away. However now being 2006, I have realized that I lost the enthusiasm for this film that I once had. And its not like I watched it so many times that I got bored of it, I rarely ever watched it. I think I only watched all the way through maybe one or twice since I got it. I guess perhaps that I was so hyped up back then about there being a Punisher film. Who would not be excited that MARVEL's famous Skull T-Shirt would finally be on the big screen and that it would be worn by Thomas Jane (Deep Blue Sea) and his enemy would be played by John Travolta (who was a terrific villain in Face/Off and Swordfish) I guess all that excitement had me look past at all the bad elements. I am not saying at all that this is a bad movie, I just realized it is not a very good one. It is just ok, but when I look back now and remember myself raving about this movie, I say, ""what was I thinking?"" Anyway here is the story.The movie starts off in Florida where FBI agent Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) in a sting operation taking down suspects (mainly 2 kids) for buying illegal guns. However in the process, one of the kids is killed. That being Frank's last mission, he can now retire from the FBI and live a peaceful life with his family. However it turns out the kid who got killed was the son of a very powerful crime boss, Howard Saint (John Trovalta). Saint then orders his men to not only kill Frank Castle, but also his family. On his family reunion, Saints men crash the party and create a massacre, shooting everybody in sight, and ending it by killing Castle's wife and son last and leaving Frank for dead. But Frank actually survives the massacre. Now after losing everything he had going for him, and realizing the law may do nothing to help Frank decided to settle the score himself. He becomes reborn into something else, a vigilante who will stop at nothing to take down Howard Saint. Loaded with deadly arsenals and a skull T-Shirt, he becomes the Punisher. What he is doing is not revenge, its punishment.Let me explain first why I have changed my opinion about this movie. (WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD) First off, let me state that the action scenes in this movie were very well. One reason could be that Director Jonathan Hensleigh chose not to use any CGI for the action sequences. He wanted to do everything old school. I respect that very much because it made the action sequences more enjoyable because they looked real. However, they are few and far apart and short. I would guess that the longest action sequence in this movie was when the Castle family was being killed, that is if you categorize a defensless family being shot as ""action"". Another reason was that this film had too many plot holes. How does Frank Castle all of sudden return to Florida with out having anything. Also, how do the bad guy all of a sudden just find out where he lives. And even if they do know where he lives, why does not Howard send every man he has o kill Castle. Also I had a problem with Frank's revenge plan. The film was interesting up until after Frank becomes the Punisher. He then devises a plan to make it seem like Saint's wife having an affair with his best friend, making Saint kill them both. Why do that, when he can just kill all of them very easily. One last thing could be that John Travolta plays one pf the worst villains ever. He hardly does anything. All he does is order his men do stuff. Sure he kills his friend and his wife, but who could blame him. When the Punisher attacks, he runs away. It was only till the end when he and the Punisher are actually face to faceIn conclusion, I am gonna say that this film did not become what it could have been. I thought this would be Thomas Jane's star making roll, sadley it was not meant to be. If you want to see really good action movie with Tom Jane, see Dee Blue Sea. I can totally understand why this movie did not do so well in the box office or why it did not get much positive feedback. I know I was once crazy about this, but I now plan to get rid of it sometime soon.",3,A so-so MARVEL movie,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,4630,"['suppose', 'spring', '2004', 'was', 'time', 'really',

836343,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B0002IQMAM,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[2, 4]","Audiences have become so accustomed to being overloaded by CGI effects in recent comic book adaptations that the idea of a tougher, leaner approach seemed to catch viewers and critics off-guard, when this latest adaptation of ""The Punisher"" premiered. Sadly, most critics chose to ignore the very qualities that made this film so special, never accepting that the story is closer in spirit to ""Sin City"" than ""Spider-Man"" or ""Daredevil"". Now that the film is available on DVD, I invite everyone to take a second look at this dark tale of the fine line one man walks between Justice and Vengeance...you may be surprised by how good it really is!The film is carefully constructed to allow viewers an opportunity to see dedicated undercover cop Frank Castle in action, and to understand the caring, loving family man Frank Castle was...before mob boss Howard Saint, and his equally ruthless wife, Livia (played by a remarkably low-key John Travolta and Laura Harring), takes vengeance for their son's death by ordering the brutal execution of Castle's entire family. As conceived, with total conviction, by Thomas Jane, Castle is so completely traumatized that he 'lets go' of what remained of his compassion, and becomes a human weapon, devoid of pity, living only to see justice done, in equal measure to the crime.This is not someone you can easily 'warm up' to, and as the movie evolves into a series of executions, you may actually start to feel more sympathy toward the Saints and their henchman, Quentin Glass (the ever-watchable Will Patton) than in Castle. But screenwriter Michael France, and co-writer and director Jonathan Hensleigh, both well-versed in the Marvel comic character, add three quirky 'innocents' (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Ben Foster, and John Pinette), who Castle warms up to, somewhat, and must ultimately protect. He will never recover the compassion that he lost, but he realizes that for many being brutalized, he is the only hope they have, giving him a purpose to live for.Unlike the earlier Dolph Lundgren ""Punisher"", hampered by a minuscule budget and two-dimensional acting, this version makes the most of its small budget, with first-class acting (including a VERY welcome cameo by Roy Scheider), incredible stunt and pyrotechnic work, and a storyline that offers far more depth than you might expect in a comic book adaptation.I sincerely hope a sequel is made, as this will be a film that will grow in stature as audiences realize how good it actually is!",4,"Gritty, Low-Tech Action Film that Works...",1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,2489,"['Audiences', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'accustomed', 'being', 'overloaded', 'CGI', 'effects', 'recent', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'idea', 'tougher', 'leaner', 'approach', 'seemed', 'catch', 'viewers', 'critics', 'off-guard', 'when', 'latest', 'adaptation', 'Punisher', 'premiered', 'Sadly', 'most', 'critics', 'chose', 'ignore', 'very', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'special', 'never', 'accepting', 'story', 'closer', 'spirit', 'Sin', 'City', 'Spider-Man', 'Daredevil', 'Now', 'film', 'available', 'DVD', 'invite', 'everyone', 'take', 'second', 'look', 'dark', 'tale', 'fine', 'line', 'one', 'man', 'Justice', 'Vengeance', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'really', 'film', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'allow', 'viewers', 'opportunity', 'see', 'dedicated', 'undercover', 'cop', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'action', 'understand', 'caring', 'loving', 'family', 'man', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'was', 'mob', 'boss', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'equally', 'ruthless', 'wife', 'Livia', 'played', 'remarkably', 'low-key', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'vengeance', 'son', 'death', 'ordering', 'brutal', 'execution', 'Castle', 'entire', 'family', 'conceived', 'total', 'conviction', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Castle', 'so', 'completely', 'traumatized', 'go', 'what', 'remained', 'compassion', 'human', 'weapon', 'devoid', 'pity', 'living', 'only', 'see', 'justice', 'done', 'equal', 'measure', 'crime.This', 'not', 'someone', 'can', 'easily', ""'warm"", 'up', 'movie', 'series', 'executions', 'may', 'actually', 'start', 'feel', 'more', 'sympathy', 'Saints', 'henchman', 'Quentin', 'Glass', 'ever-watchable', 'Will', 'Patton', 'Castle', 'screenwriter', 'Michael', 'France', 'co-writer', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Hensleigh', 'well-versed', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'character', 'add', 'three', 'quirky', ""'innocents"", 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'John', 'Pinette', 'who', 'Castle', 'somewhat', 'must', 'ultimately', 'protect', 'will', 'never', 'recover', 'compassion', 'lost', 'many', 'being', 'brutalized', 'only', 'hope', 'have', 'giving', 'purpose', 'live', 'earlier', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Punisher', 'hampered', 'minuscule', 'budget', 'two-dimensional', 'acting', 'version', 'most', 'small', 'budget', 'first-class', 'acting', 'including', 'VERY', 'welcome', 'cameo', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'incredible', 'stunt', 'pyrotechnic', 'work', 'storyline', 'far', 'more', 'depth', 'might', 'expect', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation.I', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'sequel', 'made', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'will', 'grow', 'stature', 'audiences', 'realize', 'how', 'good', 'actually']",N/A

Punisher was never a favorite of mine, but I liked him all the same. You aren't supposed to like him, he's an anti-hero. That is what makes him such a badass hero.As for the movie itself, I saw it in the theatres, so this is more a recommendation for those that haven't and that like comic book movies - to definitly consider picking this one up.It's already been mentioned that no, it's not in NYC,NY - and for good reason I think. We already have Spiderman there and the X-Men in upstate NY, the filmmakers wanted to diversify - and possibly shy away from violence in NYC after 9/11. So I can see that. As well as the fact that he's not an ex-navy seal from the Vietnam War.Other than that though, the movie is great and fits everything the Punisher stands for. The ONLY gripe I have is John Travolta didn't fit as the badguy in this movie. He was great in Face/Off and Swordfish as a badguy. I guess the filmmakers needed one big name to get people to see this film instead of it sit as a b-movie. That's ok too. But I'd rather of seen somebody else as the villian.So is this movie worth getting?

When he starts out the film in his last FBI case, he reminded me so much of Sonny Crockett from Miami Vice that it's scary (if any of you studio types are casting for the MV movie, keep him in mind). As the story progresses, we get to see more of the character of Frank Castle rather than just see him in ""Punisher mode"" throughout the film. He did an awesome job of making Castle a tortured human rather than just a killing machine.John Travolta did an admirable job as the villian. I agree with another reviewer that he did a much better bad guy in Broken Arrow and even Swordfish. He puts a lot of intensity into his character, but they should have cut him loose a little more.The only really off-the-beaten-path part of this film is the Punisher's elaborate scheme for revenge. This isn't something we'd see in the comic books. I mean, he's got such a long, complicated revenge thing going that it really dulls things a bit. So much could have gone wrong with the plan at any point, and every single thing had to go right at the right time that it just doesn't seem realistic. I think it would have been better to just see him react like the comic version and hunt them down one-by-one before killing them on the spot.All in all, a good film.

836355,AF3RMNRNRSG7W,B0002IQMAM,Brynn Huxtable,"[7, 9]","When ""The Punisher"" came out I wasn't really interested in the movie - quite frankly, I was pretty much over Action Movies in 2003 and just really didn't have the desire to really watch Action at all. However, I rented this film one day when I went to my girlfriend's place - and all I can say is that this was a killer action movie...Frank Castle (Tom Jane) retires from the FBI after many long, hard years of dedicated service. On his last assignment however, the son of a Crimelord is accidentally killed and his death is in fact his own fault. However, Howard Saint (John Travolta) is convinced that his son was murdered and seeks to find the man responsible. In the meantime, Castle attends a massive family reunion in a Tropical Paradise. Saint finds out that Frank was involved in the event which led to his son's murder and so proceeds to kill him - and his entire family - in order to get even. Saint sends a group of armed thugs to assassinate his loved ones and they succeed in killing everyone - except Frank. What follows is the bitter, dangerous and dark path that Frank must follow on his road to vengeance...Tom Jane is great as ""The Punisher"" and delivers a fantastic performance in this comic book adaptation and each character is believable and full of various idiosyncracies, including ""The Punisher"" himself...The main aspect of this film that I find so enjoyable is that ""The Punisher"" isn't actually a super hero. He's just a normal human being who declares war on those he deems to be evil. He also uses real weapons that exist in reality - no plasma cannons or lasers or whatever. ""The Punisher"" is also a hero stricken by grief and is in fact at war with himself. In short, ""The Punisher"" is a realistic, believable, multi-faceted character who feels, hates, gets confused and is plagued by his inner demons - a real man. Imperfect. Fallible. We even see him get shot, he gets beaten and kicked...he doesn't just get hit, he gets wounded, bleeds...and yet he fights on. And as Travolta says in one part of the film, ""maybe he wants to die."" That is exactly what ""The Punisher"" wants. He doesn't fear pain or death, but he runs from his destroyed life. I don't know about you, but ""The Punisher"" is one of the most real, believable and truly admirable heroes that I have ever known.The acting in this film is solid, the storyline interesting and the action engaging and violent. There's plenty of shooting and the fight between ""The Punisher"" and the Russian is just classic. There are even touches of dark humour in places that enhance the film greatly. This Action is a real tragedy and makes you wonder how you would react if your loved ones were mercilessly slaughtered. I think we'd all agree with ""The Punisher"" when he says ""God's gonna sit this one out."" I don't think I would have the strength to forgive my tormentors...that takes incredible healing and stillness of spirit. But I'm sure most of us would be consumed by our anger and hate, and ""The Punisher"" is sometimes almost completely engulfed in his sadness...his emotions and own mind become his own worst enemy.This film revived my interest in Action Movies and really gave me a new respect for heroes and the like. This film is definitely one that deserves to be amongst any Action lover's collection...do yourself a favour and rent or buy this film. If you're an Action fan, then you'll love this movie! This production comes highly recommended by myself and I've no doubt that this title will definitely be right up your alley and will make you think long and hard about all the good things that you have in your life. 94 % for ""The Punisher.""""This isn't revenge...it's punishment...""",5,Best Comic Book Hero Ever!,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,3680,"['When', 'Punisher', 'came', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'interested', 'movie', 'quite', 'frankly', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'Action', 'Movies', '2003', 'just', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'desire', 'really', 'watch', 'Action', 'However', 'rented', 'film', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'went', 'girlfriend', 'place', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'killer', 'action', 'movie', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'FBI', 'many', 'long', 'hard', 'years', 'dedicated', 'service', 'last', 'assignment', 'however', 'son', 'Crimelord', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'death', 'fact', 'own', 'fault', 'However', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'John', 'Travolta', 'convinced', 'son', 'was', 'murdered', 'find', 'man', 'responsible', 'meantime', 'Castle', 'massive', 'family', 'reunion', 'Tropical', 'Paradise', 'Saint', 'out', 'Frank', 'was', 'involved', 'event', 'led', 'son', 'murder', 'so', 'proceeds', 'kill', 'entire', 'family', 'order', 'get', 'even', 'Saint', 'group', 'armed', 'thugs', 'assassinate', 'loved', 'ones', 'succeed', 'killing', 'everyone', 'Frank', 'What', 'bitter', 'dangerous', 'dark', 'path', 'Frank', 'must', 'follow', 'road', 'vengeance', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'great', 'Punisher', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'character', 'believable', 'full', 'various', 'idiosyncracies', 'including', 'Punisher', 'main', 'aspect', 'film', 'find', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'Punisher', ""n't"", 'actually', 'super', 'hero', 'just', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'war', 'be', 'evil', 'also', 'real', 'weapons', 'exist', 'reality', 'plasma', 'cannons', 'lasers', 'Punisher', 'also', 'hero', 'stricken', 'grief', 'fact', 'war', 'short', 'Punisher', 'realistic', 'believable', 'multi-faceted', 'character', 'who', 'hates', 'confused', 'plagued', 'inner', 'demons', 'real', 'man', 'Imperfect', 'Fallible', 'even', 'see', 'get', 'shot', 'beaten', 'kicked', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'hit', 'wounded', 'bleeds', 'yet', 'Travolta', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'maybe', 'die', 'exactly', 'what', 'Punisher', ""n't"", 'fear', 'pain', 'death', 'destroyed', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Punisher', 'one', 'most', 'real', 'believable', 'truly', 'admirable', 'heroes', 'have', 'ever', 'known.The', 'acting', 'film', 'solid', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'action', 'engaging', 'violent', 'plenty', 'shooting', 'fight', 'Punisher', 'Russian', 'just', 'classic', 'are', 'even', 'touches', 'dark', 'humour', 'places', 'enhance', 'film', 'greatly', 'Action', 'real', 'tragedy', 'wonder', 'how', 'would', 'react', 'loved', 'ones', 'were', 'mercilessly', 'slaughtered', 'think', ""'d"", 'agree', 'Punisher', 'when', 'God', 'gon', 'sit', 'one', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'strength', 'forgive', 'tormentors', 'incredible', 'healing', 'stillness', 'spirit', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'would', 'be', 'consumed', 'anger', 'hate', 'Punisher', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'completely', 'engulfed', 'sadness', 'emotions', 'own', 'mind', 'become', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy.This', 'film', 'revived', 'interest', 'Action', 'Movies', 'really', 'gave', 'new', 'respect', 'heroes', 'like', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'be', 'amongst', 'Action', 'lover', 'collection', 'do', 'favour', 'rent', 'buy', 'film', ""'re"", 'Action', 'fan', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'production', 'highly', 'recommended', ""'ve"", 'doubt', 'title', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'long', 'hard', 'good', 'things', 'have', 'life', '94', '%', 'Punisher', ""n't"", 'revenge', 'punishment']",N/A

836357,A1N00127IDBHD6,B0002IQMAM,CConn,"[2, 2]","I didn't see Punisher during it's theatrical run. Like the well-documented many, I waited for the DVD release of Marvel's first adaptation of 2004. Having waited for so many months for the film,  I was, of course, treated to hearing all of the negative criticisms regarding The Punisher from nearly every critic in the Western world (okay, I'm exaggerating), and a few fans as well. Needless to say, they did not do anything for my expectations for the film. By the time the DVD release date rolled around, I was quite sure of The Punisher's quality...or lack thereof. Well, to put it bluntly, I was proven wrong. Dead wrong.Frankly, after viewing The Punisher, I was, and still am, in awe that so many could possibly give this film a bad review. It's certainly not a great film to be sure, but unlike more than one of the more...high-profile superhero adaptations, The Punisher remains quite faithful to its source material's overall tone and style, while also delivering a quite intriguing plot and lead acting performance by it's star, Tom Jane.The film begins like most of superhero origins do; with our heroes...not super. In this case Punisher is merely FBI-Agent Frank Castle. Obviously, someone in that line of work is at quite a high risk of reprisals, and that is what happens to Frank, or more specifically, his family. This of course sends him on a downward spiral of violence and revenge that will ultimately lead to the creation of the Punisher we all know. It's a pretty basic plot, that's structure closely follows that of Spider-Man or Superman: The Movie before it, but it's done well, and in a very unique and gritty way. It's not perfect, but it's all par for the course.Of course, at the center of it all, the man that makes it all work, is Tom Jane. To put it simply, Jane simply embodies  the character of the Punisher in the same way that Christopher Reeve embodied Superman, or later on, Christian Bale embodied Batman. His performance is gruff, tough, and, most of all, anguished-filled. Exactly what the Punisher needs to be. When he's with his family, we see a devoted father. When we see them die, we see his pain. And finally, when we see the Punisher enact revenge, it is brutal. The rest of the acting in the film is acceptable, albeit forgettable. Travolta neither shines nor ebbs, and most of the cast follows suit.But probably the most important, and wonderful feature of the film, is the...exact way the tone and feel from the comics was adapted. It feels like a Punisher comic. It looks like a Punisher comic.Sadly, however, nearly all of the Punisher's strength harbor flaws.  The tone, for instance. The thing that pleased me, and I'm sure several comic book fans, is also the thing that may turn casual viewers away. The Punisher is a ""style"" flick. Much like a Tarantino film (though, obviously lacking in Tarantino-level quality), Punisher is brutal. Not so much in terms of it's violence, but rather it's grit and harsh telling of its story.Ironically, the second most noticeable flaw for me was the lack of violence. While the hard-boiled feel of the Punisher was there, the brutal violence that accompanies him was not. To me, it seemed, the filmmakers were holding back a bit. Maybe for the ""casual"" fan, but since they would have already been alienated by the movie's tone, there was no excuse to hold back the Punisher's trademark violence and gore, in my mind.The last major flaw of the film would have to be its budget. Made around 20 million dollars, it's hardly a summer blockbuster, and, at times, the lack of funds is noticeable hampers the storytelling. Particularly during the films ending ""battle."" The special effects are also sized down quite a bit compared to other, larger pictures. However, this also gives the movie a very B-Movie feel which can be a pleasure in itself. So, if viewed with an open mind, that ""flaw"" can be nothing more than an enjoyable personality trait.Overall, regardless of its flaws or missteps here or there, The Punisher is a truly enjoyable B-Movie, that any fan of the genre, whether it be of comic books or little revenge flicks, should enjoy greatly.7/10",4,Faithful Adaptation; Perfect B-Movie,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,4145,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Punisher', 'theatrical', 'run', 'well-documented', 'many', 'waited', 'DVD', 'release', 'Marvel', 'first', 'adaptation', '2004', 'Having', 'waited', 'so', 'many', 'months', 'film', 'was', 'course', 'treated', 'hearing', 'negative', 'criticisms', 'regarding', 'Punisher', 'nearly', 'critic', 'Western', 'world', 'okay', ""'m"", 'exaggerating', 'few', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'Needless', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'expectations', 'film', 'time', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'rolled', 'was', 'quite', 'sure', 'Punisher', 'quality', 'lack', 'thereof', 'Well', 'put', 'bluntly', 'was', 'proven', 'wrong', 'Dead', 'wrong.Frankly', 'viewing', 'Punisher', 'was', 'still', 'am', 'awe', 'so', 'many', 'could', 'possibly', 'give', 'film', 'bad', 'review', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'more', 'one', 'more', 'high-profile', 'superhero', 'adaptations', 'Punisher', 'quite', 'faithful', 'source', 'material', 'overall', 'tone', 'style', 'also', 'delivering', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'lead', 'acting', 'performance', 'star', 'Tom', 'Jane.The', 'film', 'most', 'superhero', 'origins', 'do', 'heroes', 'not', 'super', 'case', 'Punisher', 'merely', 'FBI-Agent', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Obviously', 'someone', 'line', 'work', 'quite', 'high', 'risk', 'reprisals', 'what', 'Frank', 'more', 'specifically', 'family', 'course', 'downward', 'spiral', 'violence', 'revenge', 'will', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'creation', 'Punisher', 'know', 'pretty', 'basic', 'plot', 'structure', 'closely', 'Spider-Man', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'done', 'well', 'very', 'unique', 'gritty', 'way', 'not', 'perfect', 'par', 'course.Of', 'course', 'center', 'man', 'work', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'put', 'simply', 'Jane', 'simply', 'character', 'Punisher', 'same', 'way', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'embodied', 'Superman', 'later', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'embodied', 'Batman', 'performance', 'gruff', 'tough', 'most', 'anguished-filled', 'Exactly', 'what', 'Punisher', 'be', 'When', 'family', 'see', 'devoted', 'father', 'When', 'see', 'die', 'see', 'pain', 'finally', 'when', 'see', 'Punisher', 'enact', 'revenge', 'brutal', 'rest', 'acting', 'film', 'acceptable', 'forgettable', 'Travolta', 'shines', 'ebbs', 'most', 'cast', 'suit.But', 'probably', 'most', 'important', 'wonderful', 'feature', 'film', 'exact', 'way', 'tone', 'feel', 'comics', 'was', 'adapted', 'Punisher', 'comic', 'Punisher', 'comic.Sadly', 'however', 'nearly', 'Punisher', 'strength', 'harbor', 'flaws', 'tone', 'instance', 'thing', 'pleased', ""'m"", 'sure', 'several', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'also', 'thing', 'may', 'turn', 'casual', 'viewers', 'away', 'Punisher', 'style', 'flick', 'Much', 'Tarantino', 'film', 'obviously', 'lacking', 'Tarantino-level', 'quality', 'Punisher', 'brutal', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'terms', 'violence', 'rather', 'grit', 'harsh', 'telling', 'story.Ironically', 'second', 'most', 'noticeable', 'flaw', 'was', 'lack', 'violence', 'hard-boiled', 'feel', 'Punisher', 'was', 'there', 'brutal', 'violence', 'was', 'not', 'seemed', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'holding', 'back', 'bit', 'Maybe', 'casual', 'fan', 'would', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'alienated', 'movie', 'tone', 'was', 'excuse', 'hold', 'back', 'Punisher', 'trademark', 'violence', 'gore', 'mind.The', 'last', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'budget', 'Made', '20', 'million', 'dollars', 'hardly', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'times', 'lack', 'funds', 'noticeable', 'hampers', 'storytelling', 'Particularly', 'films', 'ending', 'battle', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'sized', 'down', 'quite', 'bit', 'compared', 'other', 'larger', 'pictures', 'However', 'also', 'movie', 'very', 'B-Movie', 'feel', 'can', 'be', 'pleasure', 'So', 'viewed', 'open', 'mind', 'flaw', 'can', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'personality', 'trait.Overall', 'regardless', 'flaws', 'missteps', 'here', 'there', 'Punisher', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'B-Movie', 'fan', 'genre', 'be', 'comic', 'books', 'little', 'revenge', 'flicks', 'should', 'enjoy', 'greatly.7/10']",N/A

Afterwards, Castle goes to Puerto Rico for a family reunion. The mob boss sends his men down to kill Castle and his entire family. But Castle survives and returns to murder the boss, all his men and his family.I didn't read the comic book so I don't care if the movie followed it. I wasn't expecting much from The Punisher but thoroughly enjoyed it. Thomas Jane does a nice job in the lead role as does John Travolta as the mob boss. When Castle comes back he takes an apartment in a run down building on the outskirts of town where his neighbors are two oddballs and a beautiful, but damaged woman.

836364,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0002IQMAM,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[62, 77]","In the world of super-heroes and evil villains, the Punisher rests squarely in that gray area between the two.  He does exhibit a sense of justice akin to that of a hero, but he bears no remorse with regards to killing, as his wraith is only suffered by those who truly deserve, those who the law cannot, or will not touch.  Revenge, justice, and retribution are his motivations, and he is judge, jury, and executioner.  The Punisher (2004), directed and co-written by Jonathan Hensleigh, who also wrote Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) and Jumanji (1995), stars Thomas Jane, who bears a remarkable resemblance to actor Christopher (Highlander) Lambert, and who I've seen before, but couldn't place until I remembered him from the film Deep Blue Sea (1999), and John Travolta.  Also appearing are Laura Herring, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (does she still carry the Stamos since their divorce?) and Roy Scheider.The film, based on a Marvel comic book of the same name, tells the story of FBI agent Frank Castle (Jane), an FBI agent, who, during a sting operation that results in the death of a suspect, finds himself at odds with a powerful crime family, lead by Howard Saint (Travolta), as, it turns out, the dead suspect was his son.  In retaliation for his son's death, Saint orders a hit on Castle and his entire family, but Castle manages to survive, and, seeing that nothing has been done to apprehend those responsible for the deaths of his family, he decides to take the law into his own hands (something Doug Llewelyn from The People's Court always advised against) and bring his own form of justice to those who sought revenge against him.  Do two wrongs make a right?  No, but they sure make for a fun movie...This actually wasn't the first screen adaptation of this comic character.  There was a film, of the same name, released way back in 1989, which starred Dolph Lundgren, which was panned by both critics and fans.  It wasn't that great, but I did enjoy it somewhat, and didn't think it was as bad as everyone thought.  This latest incarnation is certainly better, benefiting from a larger budget, better writing, and a bit more star power, but still has minor flaws.  I'd read many a comic book back in my youth, and The Punisher was one of them.  At that time, he probably had three of four different titles, being a very popular character, and Marvel Comics had a real penchant for milking any bit of popularity for all they could, often exhausting the potential way too soon in their search for the almighty dollar.  I haven't read comics in a long time, and given the nature of comic characters and their constant evolution, I was unsure how the story would be played out.  I was unfamiliar with Thomas Jane, but I thought he did a wonderful job, really embodying the essence of the character I knew well way back when.  The look, the feel, the attitudes, marked a vast improvement over the last film incarnation of the character.  I was a bit apprehensive about John Travolta being cast as the lead bad guy, as of late, when playing similar antagonistic roles, he often ventured into the realm of hamminess, but his performance was really grounded here and lacked the over the top element inherent in some of his past roles, thankfully.  The action elements in the film were done very well, bordering between the realistic and unbelievable nicely, and I really enjoyed the use of all different kinds of weaponry from hand guns, machine guns, anti-personnel mines, knives, to the bow and arrow.  Jane's character showed adeptness and a proficiency one would expect.  Some elements and scenes seemed a bit off...the plot point where Castle basically lets everyone know he didn't die in the massacre seemed illogical, as I would think the advantage of your enemies thinking you were dead would far outweigh whatever could be gained by them knowing you're alive, especially if you were planning to go after them.  Also, the complete lack of any police involvement, even after Castle began his war on Howard Saint and his organization seemed unrealistic.  And I would have expected Castle to find a secluded place to hole up, one where he could come and go as he pleased, and not a run-down apartment building with a few neighbors, including the character played by Romjin-Stamos.  The purpose was to sort of create a surrogate family for Castle, but it just seemed strange that he would choose the location he did from which to wage his war.  Finally, I have to mention the scene with the Russian assassin played by pro-wrestler Kevin Nash.  I thought the fight scene was very exciting and fun to watch, but why did the Russian show up in a red and white striped shirt, looking like a huge, lumpy candy cane?  It really disrupted the dark and gritty feel built up in the movie, as he reminded me of a lacky henchman from the 60's Batman television series.  All in all, I thought most of the movie worked well, with a few plot areas that didn't, but the positive points out-weighed the negatives, in my opinion, and I enjoyed the movie as a whole, right up until it's satisfying conclusion.The widescreen print here looks beautiful, and there's a good helping of useful and informative special features including featurettes on the stunts within the film, origins of the The Punisher character from his first appearance in a Spider-Man comic back in the 70's, a behind the scenes look at the making of the film, an interview influential cover artist for

I've never read The Punisher comic books but I remember when the film was released I was excited to see it, it looked gritty and dark and violent and that's what I wanted to see.  Well, that's what I got.  The acting is very comic book dramatic, especially on the parts of John Travolta and Thomas Jane, but there are a few actors here that transcend that and pull off fine performances, those including Rebecca Romijn (I know it floored me too), Ben Foster and Will Patton who is just freaking awesome.  Thomas Jane plays Frank Castle, an ex-undercover cop who's last job when sour and some people were killed, one of those being the son of Howard Saint (Travolta), banker/money launderer and Saint declares revenge by mercilessly killing EVERYONE in Castle's family.  Castle then becomes The Punisher and goes on a spree taking out everyone close to Saint.  The action, while not non-stop, is a definite highlight to the film, but the movie has dramatic undertones to make this more than just your average superhero, beat-em-up type film but a film about a man trying to move on from a horrible event that changed his life.

But, my favorite characters of the film had to be his three fellow apartment tennets. They provide of a lot support for this one man that they rarely know. All three actors are superb.The story itself is okay. The beginning is heart-wrenching and the second half of the movie drifts into an Othello-like complication.

836386,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B0002IQMAM,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[1, 2]","'The Punisher' tells the gritty tale of an FBI officer that loses everything he cared for just as he was leaving the FBI behind.  Frank Castle, played by Thomas Jane, finishes off one last undercover job that inadvertently leads to the death of the son of Howard Saint, played by John Travolta, a crime boss.  Seeking retribution, Saint, and his wife, order the killing of Castle and his family.  Saint's henchmen only complete half the job, and leave Castle for dead.  However, Castle insists he died that day, and the Punisher was born to avenge Castle.This movie has some incredibly good elements, and some elements that are not so good.  It recreates elements of the comic fairly well and it stays within the spirit of the comic admirably.  Some things are changed for the sake of story telling.  In the end, the movie is pretty good, but it could have been a lot better.The best part of the movie in my opinion was Jane's portrayal of Castle/the Punisher.  I was skeptical when I heard he had been chosen.  However, his portrayal of a man that has nothing to lose and little to live for was quite good.  His size and build were appropriate for the role.  His age and physique are not exactly the same as that portrayed by the character in the comic, and die hards may have a gripe there.  Still, as the character was laid out in the movie, Jane was a great choice.The biggest disappointment of the movie was how the director chose to use Travolta in the role of Howard Saint.  Not all of this was the director's fault, as Saint wasn't given that many great lines.  Travolta  has the ability to give characters an edge or to deliver a great line.  That simply didn't exist in this movie.  The character of Saint really had one good scene in which he confronts a henchmen over a possible affair with his wife while telling the story of David Bowie and the Bowie knife.  After that, this villain was just flat.My other gripe with the movie was the action.  Much of it was uninspired.  For instance, in one scene, Saint sends a Russian after Castle.  This Russian is huge and built like a tank.  The fight that ensues in Castle's apartment has a few comedic moments, but otherwise, it just lumbers along.  There is nothing impressive about it from the way it was filmed to the coreography of the fight itself.  This also speaks to much of the direction of the film itself.  Many of the shots were unimaginative.  A veteran director could have done much more with the locations that were chosen for this film.A few of the things I did enjoy included Castle's overall scheme for revenge.  He sets out to turn all the villains against each other.  When he finally confronts Saint in the end, the Punisher fully emerges and lays out what he has done in a dead pan that is perfect for the character.  I also liked the way the Punisher was kept simple.  He didn't have too many gimicks.I liked the movie.  It was much better than the Dulph Lundgren version that preceded it.  Fans of the comic book are likely to be split on how they felt about the movie.  Those that aren't familiar with the comic are likely to not enjoy this movie.  I'd recommend this as a rental.  I hope they do film a sequel and turn it over to a director and producer that can spice it up just a little so that the sequel won't lumber as much as the original did.",3,"The Character is Dead On, Everything Else is Just Dead",1097280000,"10 9, 2004",2004,3332,"['Punisher', 'gritty', 'tale', 'FBI', 'officer', 'everything', 'cared', 'just', 'was', 'leaving', 'FBI', 'behind', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'one', 'last', 'undercover', 'job', 'inadvertently', 'death', 'son', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'played', 'John', 'Travolta', 'crime', 'boss', 'Seeking', 'retribution', 'Saint', 'wife', 'order', 'killing', 'Castle', 'family', 'Saint', 'henchmen', 'only', 'complete', 'job', 'leave', 'Castle', 'dead', 'However', 'Castle', 'died', 'day', 'Punisher', 'was', 'born', 'avenge', 'Castle.This', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'good', 'elements', 'elements', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'elements', 'comic', 'fairly', 'well', 'spirit', 'comic', 'admirably', 'things', 'are', 'changed', 'sake', 'story', 'telling', 'end', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'opinion', 'was', 'Jane', 'portrayal', 'Castle/the', 'Punisher', 'was', 'skeptical', 'when', 'heard', 'had', 'been', 'chosen', 'However', 'portrayal', 'man', 'nothing', 'lose', 'little', 'live', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'size', 'build', 'were', 'appropriate', 'role', 'age', 'physique', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'same', 'portrayed', 'character', 'comic', 'die', 'hards', 'may', 'have', 'gripe', 'there', 'Still', 'character', 'was', 'laid', 'out', 'movie', 'Jane', 'was', 'great', 'choice.The', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'director', 'chose', 'use', 'Travolta', 'role', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'Not', 'was', 'director', 'fault', 'Saint', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'many', 'great', 'lines', 'Travolta', 'ability', 'give', 'characters', 'edge', 'deliver', 'great', 'line', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'movie', 'character', 'Saint', 'really', 'had', 'one', 'good', 'scene', 'henchmen', 'possible', 'affair', 'wife', 'telling', 'story', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Bowie', 'knife', 'villain', 'was', 'just', 'flat.My', 'other', 'gripe', 'movie', 'was', 'action', 'Much', 'was', 'uninspired', 'instance', 'one', 'scene', 'Saint', 'Russian', 'Castle', 'Russian', 'huge', 'built', 'tank', 'fight', 'Castle', 'apartment', 'few', 'comedic', 'moments', 'otherwise', 'just', 'lumbers', 'along', 'nothing', 'impressive', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'coreography', 'fight', 'also', 'much', 'direction', 'film', 'Many', 'shots', 'were', 'unimaginative', 'veteran', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'more', 'locations', 'were', 'chosen', 'film.A', 'few', 'things', 'did', 'enjoy', 'included', 'Castle', 'overall', 'scheme', 'revenge', 'out', 'turn', 'villains', 'other', 'When', 'finally', 'Saint', 'end', 'Punisher', 'fully', 'out', 'what', 'done', 'dead', 'pan', 'perfect', 'character', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'Punisher', 'was', 'kept', 'simple', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'many', 'gimicks.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Dulph', 'Lundgren', 'version', 'preceded', 'Fans', 'comic', 'book', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'split', 'how', 'felt', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'comic', 'are', 'likely', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'rental', 'hope', 'do', 'film', 'sequel', 'turn', 'director', 'producer', 'can', 'spice', 'up', 'just', 'little', 'sequel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lumber', 'as', 'much', 'original', 'did']",N/A

The Punisher is not as flawless as Spiderman, Batman Begins and the XMen films, but it does hold up much more than Fantastic Four, Daredevil and Hulk.  The film could have been darker to fully capture the essence of punishment, but this is still a fun and emotion-filled ride.The most shocking thing about the Punisher is the way that Frank Castle's family is murdered.  It's not just his wife and son, but everyone from both sides of the family, in broad daylight, at a reunion near the beach of beautiful Puerto Rico.  Something about that scene was so dark, because it was filmed in such broad light.  As an undercover officer, Castle got a young man murdered, and that young man was the son of Howard Saint, a big name you apparently don't mess with in Tampa.  It was the wife however - Mrs. Saint - that ordered the execution of Castle and his family.  Revenge had been served.  However, it was punishment that Castle had yet to release.I thought the characters in this film were wonderful.  John Travolta does a great job as the villain Howard Saint.  He does nothing more than order his henchmen around to do the dirty work, but his acting and emotions involved with the part are nearly flawless.  His other son, acts like a sort of henchman for his father.  Probably not even in his 20's, this young man is still tall and built, and carries the look of intimidation.  Probably nothing more than just a kid inside, he still comes off as a cool henchman.  Then there is the Russian.  He is called to deal with Castle in one scene, and its both a great fight of action and amusement.  A famous opera tune (I forget the name of) is playing in Castle's neighbor's room during the fight, adding a little humor to the mix.  But the Russian's extreme size dwarfs Castle, and keeps the action scene hard.Though it could have been darker, there is a bit of strong violence throughout the film, along with some hard hitting fights and blood.  It doesn't go as far as gore, but you do get to see several scenes of knives being shoved into bodies, and perhaps one of the most outrageous in the film, a torture scene of piercings being ripped off of one's face (though the camera does pull away).  Castle finally unleashes his revenge, ahem, punishment, in the end, though I thought it could been done with a much bigger bang.  It is nice though, to see how his intelligence allows Saint to do most of the damage to himself.Overall, this is a solid movie.  True fans will surely find something missing or different than what the comic book verison may contain.  My philosophy is if you haven't started reading them, don't, that way you can enjoy the movie for what it is.

The Punisher develops from an all to common theme of revenge. Frank Castle seeks revenge for the life of his wife and son taken brutally by Howard Saint's (John Travolta) henchmen.  Frank then becomes the Punisher.I have never read the comic book or even heard of the Punisher before this movie was made. I seen John Travolta's name on the one-sheet, so I rented the DVD. The movie is based on a Marvel Comic superhero. Does the Punisher have any super powers? I could not tell from this movie.The Punisher is action packed with graphic violence. (Reason I wanted to see!) I think some of the action scenes were just too unbelievable. Note: The pickup truck with the thugs riding in the back while jumping the sand dunes Baja style. How can you stay inside the pickup without flying in the air like you were on a trampoline?  Even if you were strapped in, the injuries would be substantial from being tossed around like a rag doll. Maybe I'm looking to closely at this comic strip superhero movie. Is the superhero character the reason why we should see this movie?And last but not least, who could resist the advances of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos's character?

Rankin,"[5, 6]","Like the Daredevil Director's Cut, this extended cut of the Punisher really adds a lot and improves the film (though not quite to the same extent as Daredevil, which was practically a total overhaul of the movie). The opening animated scene was slightly disappointing, though still interesting, but the real selling point to this DVD is the re-inserted Jimmy Weeks subplot, which is pretty much all of the added footage not shown in the theatrical version. These scenes are interesting in their own right, and they also serve to make the entire story feel tighter and more complete.Another great improvement this cut offers which may be overlooked by many is the ending. They changed the music for the end credits after the fadeout of the Punisher standing on the bridge, inserting Mark Collies's ""In Time"" (the song he plays as Harry Heck in the diner scene). This is a great song (and it's the full version of the song, with more lyrics), and it makes the ending much more effective then jumping right into Drowning Pool.The only real disappointment is the lack of extras. One ten minute featurette about making the extended cut and some comic covers. I would have liked to hear a new commentary with the director and Tom Jane.Bottom Line: If you liked the theatrical Punisher, prepare to permanently replace your old DVD with this one. Personally, I don't think I'll ever watch my theatrical DVD again, unless I wanted to revisit the extras. Unlike Daredevil, however, the changes aren't drastic enough that if you hated the original, you'll like the new version.

836391,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B0002IQMAM,Duane Thomas,"[5, 14]","There are many reasons this movie doesn't work, but let's talk about the four biggest:(1) The filmmakers seem very concerned that viewers sympathize with Frank Castle after his family's murder. Again and again, we see him moping in his derelict apartment, drinking himself into a stupor. They want us to understand he's a VICTIM. They don't realize much of the appeal of the Punisher is that he's not a victim. We love Frank Castle because he's a hate-filled killer. He's the ""victim"" who gets even. Frank Castle doesn't mope, he kicks butt and doesn't even bother to take names. Thomas Jane's Punisher seems more sullen than dangerous.(2) They're just entirely too coy about ever showing Frank in costume. In the movie Frank's soon-to-be-deceased son gives him the skull shirt as a present. And Frank does wear it a few times. But we never see him in full regalia, the black costume, white boots and gloves, the skull emblem in glorious white spread across his chest, cartridge bandolier forming its teeth. WHY? The Punisher's stark costume would look great in live action. When you get right down to it, the Punisher's outfit is a Nazi SS uniform turned into a superhero suit. They just took that little skull off the hat, blew it up to huge proportions and put it on his chest as a superhero emblem. In one of my favorite Punisher stories, an old woman, a Nazi death camp survivor, sees the Punisher crossing a rooftop and freaks because she's thinks he's an SS officer.(3) Perhaps the reason they won't put Frank in costume is (as the makers of the Dolph Lundgren version explained) they ""didn't want him to look too much like a comic book character."" This leads into the next problem with the movie: the filmmakers have divorced the Punisher from the Marvel Universe and its other heroes. One of the ""DVD extras"" is a featurette interviewing many folks responsible for writing, drawing and managing the Punisher's ""life"" over the years, in which much is made of his being the most ""grounded,"" the most ""real world"" of Marvel's heroes. There's no indication anywhere in this film it's happening in the same reality that includes, for instance, Spider-Man. This was a serious error.Punisher writer Chuck Dixon once commented on a phenomenon he at first found difficult to understand: even when sales on the Punisher's own books were in the toilet, every time he appeared on the cover of another character's book - EVERY time - sales went through the roof. Dixon eventually realized the problem was that the Punisher had become the villain in his own book. Most Punisher tales saw Frank fighting to the death against some heavily armed amoral gun nut. Thing is, that's a fair description of the Punisher himself. It's just really hard to get emotionally involved in who's going to win a fight like that. But when the Punisher went up against another hero....ah, then you had some really interesting stuff happening: good versus evil, the question of who was right or wrong, the true-blue squeaky-clean hero or the ""hero"" who kills, and the danger the Punisher represented to the good guy himself. In the back of our minds was the tantalizing possibility that maybe one day Frank might just haul off and finally blow Daredevil right out of his socks. Okay, that'll never happen....but wouldn't it be cool if it did?(4) Comics tend to operate in perpetual present. 60-plus years ago Batman was Bruce Wayne who, as a child, saw his parents murdered before his eyes; 60-plus years from now he'll still be Bruce Wayne, still 30ish and physically perfect. They can do that because there's nothing in Batman's origin anchoring him to a specific time period. But much of what defines the Punisher as a character is that he was a Marine in Vietnam. When the character first appeared in 1974 that wasn't a problem. But as the years go by and the Vietnam War recedes further into the past, Frank Castle's age must necessarily progress also. Today, realistically, Castle must be WELL into his fifties. Now, it's not unbelievable an extremely physically fit man in his fifties, who started out with the right genetics and never let himself go, could do the things he does today. Especially if, like Frank Castle, you're running on high octane hate.So the filmmakers had a decision to make: retain the Vietnam angle and deal with Frank's age or change the origin. They chose the latter. Now Castle is an ex-FBI agent with counter-terrorist experience. Thing is, when you divorce Frank Castle from the hellhole of Vietnam, the agony and emotions that war still evokes in so many people, the character loses a lot of his power. Take Vietnam away from the Punisher and what's left? Apparently, a sullen pretty boy boozing it up in a crappy apartment.",2,Four Reasons the Punisher Movie Sucks,1094601600,"09 8, 2004",2004,4735,"['are', 'many', 'reasons', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', 'let', 'talk', 'four', 'biggest', '1', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'very', 'concerned', 'viewers', 'sympathize', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'family', 'murder', 'Again', 'again', 'see', 'moping', 'derelict', 'apartment', 'drinking', 'stupor', 'want', 'understand', 'VICTIM', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'much', 'appeal', 'Punisher', 'not', 'victim', 'love', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'hate-filled', 'killer', 'victim', 'who', 'even', 'Frank', 'Castle', ""n't"", 'mope', 'butt', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'take', 'names', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Punisher', 'more', 'sullen', 'dangerous', '2', ""'re"", 'just', 'entirely', 'too', 'coy', 'ever', 'showing', 'Frank', 'costume', 'movie', 'Frank', 'soon-to-be-deceased', 'son', 'skull', 'shirt', 'present', 'Frank', 'wear', 'few', 'times', 'never', 'see', 'full', 'regalia', 'black', 'costume', 'white', 'boots', 'gloves', 'skull', 'emblem', 'glorious', 'white', 'spread', 'chest', 'cartridge', 'bandolier', 'forming', 'teeth', 'WHY', 'Punisher', 'stark', 'costume', 'would', 'look', 'great', 'live', 'action', 'When', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'Punisher', 'outfit', 'Nazi', 'SS', 'uniform', 'turned', 'superhero', 'suit', 'just', 'took', 'little', 'skull', 'hat', 'blew', 'up', 'huge', 'proportions', 'put', 'chest', 'superhero', 'emblem', 'one', 'favorite', 'Punisher', 'stories', 'old', 'woman', 'Nazi', 'death', 'camp', 'survivor', 'Punisher', 'crossing', 'rooftop', 'freaks', 'thinks', 'SS', 'officer', '3', 'Perhaps', 'reason', 'wo', ""n't"", 'put', 'Frank', 'costume', 'makers', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'version', 'explained', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'look', 'too', 'much', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'next', 'problem', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'divorced', 'Punisher', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'other', 'heroes', 'One', 'DVD', 'extras', 'featurette', 'interviewing', 'many', 'folks', 'responsible', 'writing', 'drawing', 'managing', 'Punisher', 'life', 'years', 'much', 'made', 'being', 'most', 'grounded', 'most', 'real', 'world', 'Marvel', 'heroes', 'indication', 'anywhere', 'film', 'happening', 'same', 'reality', 'instance', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'serious', 'error.Punisher', 'writer', 'Chuck', 'Dixon', 'once', 'commented', 'phenomenon', 'first', 'found', 'difficult', 'understand', 'even', 'when', 'sales', 'Punisher', 'own', 'books', 'were', 'toilet', 'time', 'appeared', 'cover', 'character', 'book', 'EVERY', 'time', 'sales', 'went', 'roof', 'Dixon', 'eventually', 'realized', 'problem', 'was', 'Punisher', 'had', 'become', 'villain', 'own', 'book', 'Most', 'Punisher', 'tales', 'saw', 'Frank', 'fighting', 'death', 'heavily', 'armed', 'amoral', 'gun', 'nut', 'Thing', 'fair', 'description', 'Punisher', 'just', 'really', 'hard', 'get', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'who', 'going', 'win', 'fight', 'when', 'Punisher', 'went', 'up', 'hero', '.ah', 'then', 'had', 'really', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'happening', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'question', 'who', 'was', 'right', 'wrong', 'true-blue', 'squeaky-clean', 'hero', 'hero', 'who', 'danger', 'Punisher', 'represented', 'good', 'guy', 'back', 'minds', 'was', 'tantalizing', 'possibility', 'maybe', 'one', 'day', 'Frank', 'might', 'just', 'haul', 'off', 'finally', 'blow', 'Daredevil', 'right', 'socks', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'never', 'happen', '.but', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'cool', 'did', '4', 'Comics', 'tend', 'operate', 'perpetual', 'present', '60-plus', 'years', 'ago', 'Batman', 'was', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'who', 'child', 'saw', 'parents', 'murdered', 'eyes', '60-plus', 'years', 'now', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'still', '30ish', 'physically', 'perfect', 'can', 'do', 'nothing', 'Batman', 'origin', 'anchoring', 'specific', 'time', 'period', 'much', 'what', 'Punisher', 'character', 'was', 'Marine', 'Vietnam', 'When', 'character', 'first', 'appeared', '1974', 'was', ""n't"", 'problem', 'years', 'go', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'further', 'past', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'age', 'must', 'necessarily', 'progress', 'also', 'Today', 'realistically', 'Castle', 'must', 'be', 'WELL', 'fifties', 'Now', 'not', 'unbelievable', 'extremely', 'physically', 'fit', 'man', 'fifties', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'right', 'genetics', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'could', 'do', 'things', 'today', 'Especially', 'Frank', 'Castle', ""'re"", 'running', 'high', 'octane', 'hate.So', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'decision', 'make', 'retain', 'Vietnam', 'angle', 'deal', 'Frank', 'age', 'change', 'origin', 'chose', 'latter', 'Now', 'Castle', 'ex-FBI', 'agent', 'counter-terrorist', 'experience', 'Thing', 'when', 'divorce', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'hellhole', 'Vietnam', 'agony', 'emotions', 'war', 'still', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'character', 'lot', 'power', 'Take', 'Vietnam', 'away', 'Punisher', 'what', 'left', 'Apparently', 'sullen', 'pretty', 'boy', 'boozing', 'up', 'crappy', 'apartment']",N/A

836395,A2F89BTWLSEEKF,B0002IQMAM,Edward M. Erdelac,"[1, 5]","This is hardly the definitive Punisher film it ought to be - and I AM an old school Frank Castle fan, starting way back with the Mike Zeck limited series (and the original B+W stories), on through the monthly title and Punisher War Zone.  I'll admit I haven't gotten the chance to read Garth Ennis' recent take on Frank Castle, though I hear this movie borrowed a great deal from it, apparently (I hear) in the form of the `neighbors' in the tenement slum.  A step up from the Dolph Lundren 80's film, but where's Jigsaw, and the battle van, and Microchip?  Well, as I said, its not the definitive Punisher movie, and it hardly feels like a Punisher movie at all for the most part (only a few skull appearances link this to the comic character).But why do I think its worth seeing?  Well, its the no holds barred attitude.  While watching this, I was struck by how much this felt like an old eighties action flick - a la `Road House,' `Commando' or `Cobra.'  Short on sense, high on righteous anger and inventive bloodshed.  No wire work, lots of car crashes, and flying lead, and at least one knock down drag out fight.  This mixes the adrenaline-rush-cheer-on-the-anti-hero ace kicking of an eighties actioneer with the over the top bloodshed of a modern day film outing.I have to admit though, this is one SADISTIC movie.  The Punisher REALLY dishes out the pain, both psychologically and physically.  We're talking about twisted around necks, gruesome scaldings with boiling  water, hunting knife stabbings worthy of Jason Voorhees, and a climax that has to be seen to be believed (it involves not only a lot of car explosions, but a coldhearted psychological mindscrew that's like The Man With No Name putting one over on Tony from `Scarface') - I think the screenwriters are into some heavy stuff.  I counted the actual word `sadism' about three times in the dialogue or narration, and there are some absolutely brutal scenes which I was really suprised to find in a main stream comic book movie.  I'm not just talking about the killings (in a major departure from the comic, rather than just his wife and children, Castle's ENTIRE EXTENDED family is gunned down by the bad guys!!!??!), but there's at least one scene of excruciating torture involving a guy's multiple body piercings that had even this old Dawn Of The Dead (old, not new) fan wincing in his seat.As I mentioned, much of the story involves Castle (here a retired FBI agent and ex-Delta Force Marine, rather than the Vietnam veteran of the comic) seeking an inroad into toppling crimelord John Travolta (a little more subdued than usual - thank the Maker) and his bloodthirsty Cuban wife, son, and merciless enforcers, who all had a hand in eliminating his family in an orchestrated massacre at his father's (the legendary and lamentedly long out of sight Roy Scheider - go see `Sorcerror' or `The Seven Ups' to see this old-schooler in action) beach house in Puerto Rico.  Castle's base of operations is a rundown apartment in a low rent tenement, where his three oddball loser neighbors (one of them Rebecca Romain-Stamos) snoop about and generally try to bring him into their surrogate `family.'  This must be some sort of device to humanize The Punisher, and I'll admit the characters were odd enough to keep me interested, though I kept saying to myself `The Punisher wouldn't do that.'  Maybe their antics kept me distracted from the more glaring faults and character departures of this movie (as I remember it, The Punisher was ALL business, and wouldn't cuddle up with a bottle of Wild Turkey as it would've `weakened' him).  I don't know, but when the weird hitmen started showing up, I began to really enjoy myself.  The first assassin, the Memphis guitar player was a particular standout - imagine if young Johnny Cash had gone straight up evil (`I wrote that song for you.  I'm gonna play it at your funeral.' - AWESOME!).  Wish there'd been more of him.  Then there's the wrestler Kevin Nash as a nearly unstoppable Russian giant that seems like an homage to every character Richard `Jaws' Kiel ever played.  That wasn't the only familiar thing I saw either, I swear some scenes were direct re-makes of the original Mad Max - particularly the sequence where Castle is running down the boardwalk toward his wife and child, and the part where he leaves a certain bad guy to die by his own hand while pinned under a heavy shelf (reminded me of the classic Johnny The Boy sequence, where Max handcuffs him to the bomb and leaves him a hacksaw to saw his way out if he can...).  Lot of old west references too - the showdown in the building lobby after Frank dumps all the money out the window comes to mind.But what the heck, its not so's you'd notice unless you were really familiar with that stuff.  Not too many groaners (the cliched flaming symbol like the `DD' in Daredevil and the crow symbol in The Crow was the only one I really had), and most of the people around me seemed to enjoy it - chuckling nervously at the more gruseome scenes, and ooing and aahing in the appropriate places.  I gotta admit, this was a guilty pleasure - and when Thomas Jane sends the `surprise' up the dumbwaiter and then waltzes in in the skull-painted body armor armed for war, he really IS The Punisher as you've always wanted to see him.  Could've been better, more focused, and a lot tighter, but I enjoyed it for the nostalgia of the eighties action flicks it conjured up for me.",3,Old Timey Punishment!

Jane lacked the prerequisite charisma necessary for audiences to root for his ultimate victory. John Travolta's character, Howard Saint, is cool and collected, but underneath his calm exterior beats the heart of his ""Swordfish,"" character--- Gabriel.  Travolta is so riveting, as a bad guy, that you hope he wins in the end.  Cheering for Travolta says more about the ineptitude of Jane rather that the tour de force of Travolta.  Even when Jane's entire family is exterminated by the hired guns of Howard Saint (Travolta), you don't sympathize with him.  Typically, when the protagonist is laying the foundation for his motivation and concurrent actions, you either lament with him through extreme ""pathos"" for his lost or ponder his next move. The internal dialogue being, ""I'd feel the same way if someone killed my family in such a heinous fashion."" The second option would be sympathizing with the character's ""Ice in the veins.""  Denzel Washington did it adroitly in ""Man on Fire."" By taking the only person he loved, Washington made you feel his extremes for retribution were warranted.  Not so with ""The Punisher."" No feelings are evoked. The brooding, mysterious man of action, just doesn't work for Thomas Jane. Actor Josh Hartnett would have done for ""The Punisher"" what Christian Bale did for ""Batman"".  Largely, provide depth and context to the action.I recommend ""The Punisher"" for Travolta's portrayal as well as the supporting cast as organized criminals with charismatic edges.

Both characters are vigilantes; both characters have been turned into who they are due to the criminal deaths of their families; and both are mere mortals.  However, whereas THE BATMAN was given a big screen reception with star power and a modestly entertaining script, THE PUNISHER -- in its second attempt at the silver screen -- seems to languish in mediocrity.Tom Jane does an admirable job at trying to bring sense to the life of Frank Castle, a former government agent who retires from the job in order to, finally, spend more time with his family.  However, his last job -- playing a drug lord in a sting operation -- goes horribly awry and ends up causing the shooting death of a thug belonging to the Saint family ... and Howard Saint (played in almost understated parody by the usually reliable John Travolta) wants Castle and his family dead as a consequence.  True enough, a squadron of professional killers are dispatched to due in the reliable screen talent of the lovely Samantha Mathis (appearing briefly as Mrs. Castle) and JAWS and BLUE THUNDER action star Roy Scheider (appearing even more briefly as Frank Castle, Sr.); however, logic fails the bad guys as the appear almost singly in the future endeavors, always a fatal mistake when going mano-a-mano with a comic book character.This isn't to say that THE PUNISHER doesn't have its strengths.  To the contrary, this telling is a slight departure from the original Punisher mythos, where Castle basically declares war on the mob/mafia as retribution for the killing of his family; this time out, Castle is given a new 'family' of sorts that takes the shapes of the unlikely group of tenants in the building where he lives: the comely Rebecca Romijm-Stamos (Joan), John Pinette (Bumpo), and Ben Foster (Dave).  In fact, PUNISHER tries but fails to reach some of the heights hinted at when Dave, after being inadvertantly protected by Castle, mumbles, ""No one ever stood up for me before.""  Unfortunately, the touching moments are quickly dispatched with sorely predictable gunplay and explosions, and sentimentality is sacrificed for near lunacy of a plot.Sadly, the film is short far more like a television movie than it is a true theatrical outing befitting some of Marvel's other recent properties (SPIDER-MAN and THE HULK as example), and a significant portion of film is bathed in blackness, making the murky picture only fall hand-in-hand with the murkier script.  Some moments are sacrificed by the lovely eye candy of Laura Harring as the modestly grief-stricken Livia Saint, but, as Travolta says, ""She took a train.""All this and thrown in a woefully out-of-place baddie named only ""The Russian"" seemingly plucked from a really bad ""Popeye"" script keeps this Punisher dishing out more punishment on the audience than the bad guys who deserved it.",2,Less-Than-Capital Punishment,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,2922,"['hard', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'THE', 'PUNISHER', 'Marvel', 'counterpoint', 'DC', 'Comics', 'THE', 'BATMAN', 'characters', 'are', 'vigilantes', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'who', 'are', 'due', 'criminal', 'deaths', 'families', 'are', 'mere', 'mortals', 'However', 'THE', 'BATMAN', 'was', 'given', 'big', 'screen', 'reception', 'star', 'power', 'modestly', 'entertaining', 'script', 'THE', 'PUNISHER', 'second', 'attempt', 'silver', 'screen', 'languish', 'mediocrity.Tom', 'Jane', 'admirable', 'job', 'trying', 'bring', 'sense', 'life', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'former', 'government', 'agent', 'who', 'job', 'order', 'finally', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'family', 'However', 'last', 'job', 'playing', 'drug', 'lord', 'sting', 'operation', 'horribly', 'awry', 'up', 'causing', 'shooting', 'death', 'thug', 'belonging', 'Saint', 'family', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'played', 'almost', 'understated', 'parody', 'usually', 'reliable', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Castle', 'family', 'dead', 'consequence', 'True', 'enough', 'squadron', 'professional', 'killers', 'are', 'dispatched', 'due', 'reliable', 'screen', 'talent', 'lovely', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'appearing', 'briefly', 'Mrs.', 'Castle', 'JAWS', 'BLUE', 'THUNDER', 'action', 'star', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'appearing', 'even', 'more', 'briefly', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Sr.', 'however', 'logic', 'bad', 'guys', 'appear', 'almost', 'singly', 'future', 'endeavors', 'always', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'when', 'going', 'mano-a-mano', 'comic', 'book', 'character.This', ""n't"", 'say', 'PUNISHER', ""n't"", 'have', 'strengths', 'contrary', 'telling', 'slight', 'departure', 'original', 'Punisher', 'mythos', 'where', 'Castle', 'basically', 'war', 'mob/mafia', 'retribution', 'killing', 'family', 'time', 'out', 'Castle', 'given', 'new', ""'family"", 'sorts', 'shapes', 'unlikely', 'group', 'tenants', 'building', 'where', 'comely', 'Rebecca', 'Romijm-Stamos', 'Joan', 'John', 'Pinette', 'Bumpo', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Dave', 'fact', 'PUNISHER', 'reach', 'heights', 'hinted', 'when', 'Dave', 'being', 'inadvertantly', 'protected', 'Castle', 'mumbles', 'one', 'ever', 'stood', 'up', 'Unfortunately', 'touching', 'moments', 'are', 'quickly', 'dispatched', 'sorely', 'predictable', 'gunplay', 'explosions', 'sentimentality', 'sacrificed', 'near', 'lunacy', 'plot.Sadly', 'film', 'short', 'far', 'more', 'television', 'movie', 'true', 'theatrical', 'outing', 'befitting', 'Marvel', 'other', 'recent', 'properties', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'THE', 'HULK', 'example', 'significant', 'portion', 'film', 'bathed', 'blackness', 'making', 'murky', 'picture', 'only', 'fall', 'hand-in-hand', 'murkier', 'script', 'moments', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'lovely', 'eye', 'candy', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'modestly', 'grief-stricken', 'Livia', 'Saint', 'Travolta', 'took', 'train', 'thrown', 'woefully', 'out-of-place', 'baddie', 'named', 'only', 'Russian', 'seemingly', 'plucked', 'really', 'bad', 'Popeye', 'script', 'Punisher', 'dishing', 'out', 'more', 'punishment', 'audience', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'deserved']",N/A

It gives the film a whole new look that was missing before! I won't give it away but it has a new subplot that makes the film make more sense (much like the director's cut of Daredevil) and makes it better in my view!On a personal note, for those that says its nothing but mindless violence and that it has no regard for human life obviously didn't watch the film or read the comics! Yes, there is gory violence but this isn't freakin' Spider-man (though I enjoy that character's movies as well)! The Punisher ISN'T a nice character. I am not married nor do I have children but if my wife and son (along with my extended family) was gunned down in front of my eyes, I don't think I'd have such a positive attitude either. Also, Frank Castle isn't so hellbent that he can't see suffering around him. If that was so, he wouldn't have helped Joan (played by Rebecca Romjin) with that creepy boyfriend of hers or befriend (sort of) Joan and her friends or left the ""gift"" that he left so on that note, Frank Castle wasn't totally twisted.Anyway, back to the DVD, it has the animated beginning both with the film and seperate. Also, there is a 10 minute short explaining the new extended cut as well as classic Punisher covers from the comics.

836405,A2YUZLS56MWH7N,B0002IQMAM,F. Lam,"[1, 3]","For those who are comic book fans and masses of the Punisher, pull up some chairs and gather around in this discussion review with me. As you know back in the late 70's Frank Castle made his 1st appearance in Amazing Spider-Man comics before Stan Lee gave Frank his own mini-series of his origins and monthly series.Back then, Frank Castle was a Vietnam Veteran spending a quite evening with his family in Central Park, N.Y.C. but out of nowhere, they were caught in the crossfire of a rival mobster shootout. His wife and son were killed as Frank was badly injured and survived. In the aftermath, Frank had his mind set on taking revenge on those who killed his family and every mobster in N.Y.In the rewritting of his character, as in the movie, Frank (Thomas Pane) is an undercover F.B.I. agent laying low with his entire family on vacation after pulling a sting operation on Howard Saint's (John Travolta) cronies that got Howard's son killed. Howard went after Frank's entire family. His mom, dad (Roy Schneider), cousins, uncles, aunts, wife, and son were killed by Howard's henchmen. Leaving Frank the last one to suffer and die. However, Frank survived again and becomes hell bent on getting revenge on Howard Saint and his mafia organization.I tend to agree this film has some quirks in the writing portion and Mr. Non-redneck from Houston, Texas made a good point on why couldn't the villian be the Kingpin. Well Non-redneck the Kingpin is one of Frank's main villians but please remember, the Kingpin happens to be Daredevil's #1 arch villian next in line with Bullseye. Daredevil has always been going after Kingpin way before the Punisher came on to the scene. Jigsaw is Frank's arch rival. Frank may be going after some of Daredevil's rogues, but you won't see him going after any of Spider-Man's villians like; Sandman, Dr. Octopus, or Green Goblin. He never goes after super-powered villians. Frank only targets the N.Y. mafia gangs. Jigsaw is a mobster who got shot in the face by Frank and swore to get even with him for making his face disfigured. (Look for Marvel/DC crossover with Batman and Punisher. They made a unique team-up against Joker and Jigsaw. Joker made a business partnership with Jigsaw and paid for his facial reconstruction. Later on, Frank kindly repaid Jigsaw with a new makeover and almost killed Joker.) And I'm very astonished to hear a sequel is in the works with Jigsaw as the main villian.But overall, this movie foretells the beginnings of Frank Castle. Some story origins of heroes might not make a film like this one to meet any comic-book fan's expectations. Look at the Hulk, I expected that movie to be more accurate to the Hulk's origins but it wasn't. And in the end, Frank leaves his calling card after killing off Saint and his gang, and made a solemn vow to make ""rapists, murders, sadists, mobsters; they will all answer to The Punisher.""",4,Vigilance is not revenge.

836410,ABYTU7EFC5E1Y,B0002IQMAM,"gene park ""Gene Park:  Freelance Writer/Adven...","[3, 5]","Out of all the comic books that have been adapted into movies over the past few years, ""The Punisher"" was the one I'd been praying for to be made.  I thought for sure Hollywood would be able to make a great movie out of this character.  Look at what they were able to do with Blade, a character who's hardly even mentioned in the Marvel Universe.  ""Spider-man"" was great, ""X-men"" was good, and ""X2"" was even better.  Even ""Hulk"", though a failed experiment, could be commended on what it was trying to achieve.  And so I pleaded with The Powers that Be for a release of an awesome Punisher movie.  A no-holds-barred action extravaganza full of bloodshed and bullets.  But, of course because I asked for it, it didn't happen.  Instead I was given Jonathon Hensleigh's ""The Punisher"", another perfect example which can be added to the ranks of ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" and ""Batman & Robin"" of how not to make a comic book movie.I am not reviewing ""The Punisher"" as just a movie.  I can't.  I've been reading ""The Punisher"" comic since I was ten.  I have almost every issue of Garth Ennis's run on the book.  I have toys, t-shirts, and posters of him.  I want The Punisher skull tattooed on my body.  I love this character.  I know him, I understand the way he works.  I can't review this as just a movie.  Instead I have to review this as an adaptation of the comic book.  So if you're just a casual movie-goer who's never read ""The Punisher"" you may highly disagree with my opinion.  But then again, it doesn't work too well as a movie either.In the comic, The Punisher is Frank Castle.  A Vietnam veteran turned cop, he witnessed his wife and two children gunned down in the crossfire of a mob shootout during their family picnic.  This completely random act of violence caused Castle to snap and he vowed to hunt down and kill every criminal he could during his life.  In the film, Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is an undercover FBI agent who served in the Marines during the Gulf War.  During his last assignment, the son of money launderer Howard Saint (John Travolta) is killed.  Saint finds out that Castle is at a family reunion in Puerto Rico and orders for the entire family to be slaughtered.  After being shot several times, including point blank in the chest, and then blown up, Castle somehow survives.  When he learns that the police have done nothing to solve the crime, he takes it upon himself to punish the guilty.  Hence, he becomes The Punisher.I remember reading interviews with Hensleigh and the other jerk who wrote the screenplay saying that they had done their research on the character.  By research I think they meant they flipped through the comic and looked at the pretty pictures, but after seeing their version of The Punisher, I can't believe they did any reading.  If they had, they would have realized that the Punisher is more than a man bent on revenge.  No, the Punisher is a psychopath who uses his family's massacre as an excuse to kill.  This would have been great material to explore in film, but Hensleigh and his buddy are big Hollywood hotshots who know what's better.  So they ignored the Frank Castle's entire Vietnam background, threw in some blurb about him being in Desert Storm so there would be an excuse for his artillery knowledge, and turned the Punisher into another revenge-driven cliche.  Not only that, but Hensleigh's Punisher is a self-loathing alcoholic who uses elaborate yet ridiculous strategies involving blackmail and fake fire hydrants to kill his enemies.  And he uses a bow and arrow like Hawkeye.  And I think he's homophobic.  I don't want to go into anymore detail here, but I can assure you that none of that is the Punisher.After seeing the promotional pictures and movie trailer, I had a bad feeling I wouldn't be able to accept Thomas Jane as the Punisher.  He more or less looks like the character and his voice is okay, but he's just not perfect the way Hugh Jackman was as Wolverine, although you can tell he's trying his best to be this character.  His Punisher exerts humanity, and that's something the comic book Punisher has little of.  He's not intense enough, nor is he big enough.  It's hard to believe that I prefer Dolph Lundgren's Punisher from the 1999 direct-to-video feature over Jane's, and Lundgren didn't even have the skull t-shirt or trench coat.John Travolta does a great job of showing up to grab his paycheck, but he does little else.  I was really looking forward to him in this because he's played great villains in the past.  Here, he's barely in the movie and he's barely going through the motions.  The Punisher's adversaries are supposed to be bizarre, funny, eccentric mob bosses or flunkies.  Howard Saint is a fat, boring money launderer who worries about his wife cheating on him.  Thankfully, the other villains aren't such letdowns.  If the filmmakers had any common sense, they would have realized during filming that Will Patton's Quentin Glass should have been the big bad.  Patton makes his character menacing, charming, and interesting.  He's everything a comic book villain should be.  There's also the two Darth Maul's of the film, the assassins Harry Heck and The Russian, who are so bizarre that they remind us that this is supposed to be a comic book movie.  The Punisher's fight with the Russian (wrestler Kevin Nash) looks like it was pulled straight from the Ennis comic, which I was very happy to see.There are other elements pulled from the comic, such as the Punisher's neighbors Joan, Spacker Dave, and Mr. Bumpo, and the last half hour showdown felt like the Punisher, but it wasn't enough to make me forgive the first hour and a half.This may well mark the beginning of the end for comic book movies.  It's definitely one foot in the grave, and Halle Berry's ""Catwoman"" is gonna be the other.  While this movie was a huge letdown, I am hoping for a sequel to give the Punisher another chance.D+ or 2 1/2 stars out of 5",2,Why Am I Being Punished?,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,5955,"['comic',

836411,A1I8F97AHES8YD,B0002IQMAM,George Graham,"[0, 2]","For nearly as long as movies have been made, critics have reviewed films based on another source. When based on a novel, the critic will most likely have some knowledge of it and compare it to the film. When it comes to comic books, however, critics are often rather clueless if it isn't some guy in spandex they read growing up. The Punisher (who admittedly was conceived over 30 years ago) was always a dark chapter in the Marvel Comic universe, and I truly do believe that a majority of the critics who despise this movie don't even know what they're watching an adaptation of. I'm not trying to put them down, as some great comic book films (the original Superman and its sequel, Spider-Man 2 and possibly the first, maybe Batman) are entertaining to even those who are unfamiliar with the comic. The Punisher film is based mostly on Garth Ennis' WELCOME BACK, FRANK series of comics that basically reinvented the character, adding in a much more sadistic side to the Punisher and his actions. It also has a great deal of dark humor among its brutal violence, as does the movie (yet one of the biggest complaints about the movie is its uneven tone). In that respect I can only say maybe it's easier to switch between comedy and drama more easily on paper than on film, but I never felt that the tone was uneven, just that some comic moments were there to lighten the very dark mood.Anyway, the basic plot is this: Frank Castle (played terrifically by Tom Jane) is a Tampa FBI agent whose undercover drug bust results in the death of powerful businessman Howard Saint's (a just-under-over-the-top John Travolta) son Bobby (James Carpinello). This was Castle's last case, and now he plans to move to London with his loving wife Maria (Samantha Mathis) and young son Will (Marcus Johns) and lead a normal life. Saint, however, secretly a vicious criminal, along with his luscious but beyond cold-hearted wife Livia's (Laura Harring) coaxing, orders Castle's entire family to be slaughtered to pay for Bobby's death. So the Castle family reunion in Costa Rica is interrupted by Quentin Glass (Will Patton), Howard's right-hand man, and his men (including Saint's other son John, also Carpinello), and all of Castle's family (including Maria, Will, and his parents) are killed mercilessly. Castle is also left for dead (usually a severe beating, two bullets to the knees, a point blank shot to the chest, and an explosion takes a lot out of you) but is found by local ""witch doctor"" Candelaria (Veryl Jones) and nursed back to health over a serious of unseen months. Castle then returns to the site of the slaughter, takes his father's guns, and sets out to destroy Saint's life as the Punisher, donning the skull shirt Will gave him. He sets up shop in an apartment complex occupied by three other outcasts: high school drop-out, video game fanatic, and fan of piercings ""Spacker"" Dave (Ben Foster); lumpy opera loving Cowardly Lion Mr. Bumpo (stand-up comic John Pinette); and depressed waitress Joan (Rebecca Romijn), who all befriend Frank and add the comic relief that everyone hated (check WELCOME BACK, FRANK, people, you'll get a very similar effect). Bullets fly, bodies fall, and the veins in Travolta's head throb more and more as his entire life and fortune collapse. It's not vengeance, it's punishment...Now many fans of the comic complained about the changes made (The Punisher lives in New York, not Florida; his skull shirt is not given to him by his son; only his wife, daughter, and son were killed because they saw a mob hit during a picnic; the list goes on), but none of them really hurt the story (the main change, going from New York to Florida is due to budget issues and the addition of a drug subplot that would make more sense in Florida due to its closeness to Cuba). Also, even the film's critics agree that Jane does a fine job as Frank/The Punisher, delivering all of his admittedly cheesy one-liners with a straight face and gritty tone. So overall I believe that the one thing the film lacks an entry point for non-fans. To really get the full experience you have to know a lot about the character, but then again, some people who enjoyed it had never read the comic. I guess it depends on what kind of movies you like.

What more could one ask for?Thomas Jane plays the title role, who is out to get the stereotypical sneering bad guy (John Travolta seems to be making a career of playing this type) who murdered his wife and son. Along the way people get shot, stabbed, blown to bits, burned... well I think you've got the idea.Since this film is more or less a fantasy (Marvel Comic based), the makers can get away with all kinds of trangressions: no cops are seen anywhere in the movie, in spite of all kinds of mayhem.  Bad guys are simply erased from existence, with a witty one liner to send them off (ala Schwarzenegger).The film is fun to watch overall.

This is a good piece of film.After working with the FBI Frank Castle decides to retire and take time off. He goes to a family reunion in Puerto Rico. But a man named Howard Saint had a son who was killed after a mission that involved Castle and wanted to know who was involed. When the info gets back to Saint he plans a hit on Castle, his wife wants his whole family dead. Frank Castle's family gets killed in a hit, but Castle survives. But Castle dosn't seek revenge, he seeks Punishment. Castle stalks his enemys and turn's the Saint families life into hell. But the Saints won't let Castle f**k with them when they plan all sorts of hits. My favorite one is the The Russian fighting Castle and Castle gets pretty messed up. But even that wouldn't stop Castle to get to Howard Saint.This film gives you the birth of the Punisher and I enjoy it. I might get alot of neggitive stuff when I say this but I don't care but this is way better than both Spiderman films. Spiderman 2 sucks, and the first film wasn't all that great.

It was only about a half hour into this rather violent picture that it became apparent that the characters were just too off the wall NOT to be comic book creations. Now Tom (aka Thomas) Jane is a worthy actor to portray such heroes: he certainly is buff and the camera concentrates more on his rather magnificent shirtless torso than on the story (a good choice in this case). John Travolta continues his survey of just plain evil guys, and the good guys equal the bad guys as far as character portrayal. The concept of Revenge (read Punishment) is developed a bit slowly because of Jane's character diversion of becoming an alcohol and hiding in a rooming house with some pretty absurd characters. But given the genre of comic book stories, this one stands up pretty well. It is so obvious that there will be more sequels (if this film makes any money on the world market) unless this singular effort becomes 'toast' like about every character in this LaLa Land movie.

Spider-Man 2 was overblown and careened off course too many times...and I won't even touch Catwoman.Anyway, The Punisher was probably the most overexposed comic book character when I was growing up, riding the tide of the violent-comic craze of the late 80's/early 90's.  At one point, I think he had 5 monthly titles (Punisher, War Journal, War Zone, Original Punisher, 2099), plus popped up in every other title at least once a year.  Fortunately, Joe Quesada, Garth Ennis, Steve Dillon, and Tim Bradstreet came in to save the day a few years back, and Frank Castle is better than ever.  While I really enjoyed this film in the theater, the DVD release is second-to-none, as far as comic releases go.  Not only do you get the excellent film and the usual ""behind-the-scenes"" stuff, but - get this - interviews with REAL COMIC CREATORS.  What a shock, huh?  Plus, a nifty little comic book inside the case.  I hope Marvel wakes up and has more input to put together packages like this for other releases.  Remember, these characters came from comics...and if they're so concerned about selling more books as a result of the movie, throw a comic in there with the disc.

The 2004 movie story said that Castle was undercover FBI agent, during his last sting the son of a money launderer, Howard Saint was killed.

With less money Hensleigh create a more classic action pieces that similar to Sam Peckinpah and  Sergio Leone in style and tone, early Peckinpah and Leone films had plenty of violence but it was largely bloodless (this is before ""The Wild Bunch"") where the idea was less is more, the Castle massacre was mostly bloodless, holding out until the climactic shootout at the Saint's club.Overall Hensleigh did a decent job with the limited number of recourses he had, the performance he gets out of Jane, Travolta, and others makes up for the lack of action.",4,Natural Justice,1095120000,"09 14, 2004",2004,2576,"['system', 'justice', 'imperfect', 'best', 'world', 'laws', 'protect', 'wrongful', 'prosecution', 'state', 'times', 'help', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'freedom', 'taken', 'away', 'least.That', 'where', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Castle', 'avatar', 'nations', 'frustrations', 'when', 'Justice', 'away', 'even', 'completely', 'uncivilized', 'one', 'man', 'be', 'judge', 'jury', 'executioner', 'Castle', 'dark', 'evil', 'feelings', 'feel', 'when', 'fiend', 'escape', 'punishmentCastle', 'went', 'henchmen', 'Spiderman', 'comic', 'own', 'regular', 'series', 'reflecting', 'cynicism', 'jadedness', '70s', '80s', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'kills', 'who', 'do', 'wrong.In', '2003', 'tinsel', 'town', 'took', 'stab', 'putting', 'first', 'true', 'modern', 'antihero', 'big', 'screen', 'putting', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'not', 'stranger', 'filmmaking', 'Jonathan', 'Hensleigh', 'charge', 'actor', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'first', 'leading', 'role', 'Punisher.Hensleigh', 'did', 'bit', 'tweaking', 'setting', 'origin', 'story', 'Punisher', 'normal', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'put', 'budget', 'reason', 'had', 'film', 'Tampa', 'Castle', 'Gulf', 'War', 'vet', 'instead', 'Vietnam', 'vet', '2004', 'movie', 'story', 'said', 'Castle', 'was', 'undercover', 'FBI', 'agent', 'last', 'sting', 'son', 'money', 'launderer', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'was', 'killed', 'digging', 'around', 'Saint', 'Castle', 'family', 'estate', 'whole', 'Castle', 'line', 'exterminated', 'Frank', 'comic', 'where', 'just', 'wife', 'children', 'killed', 'Castle', 'lose', 'mother', 'father', 'nephews', 'nieces', 'aunts', 'uncles', 'in-laws', ""n't"", 'turn', 'murderous', 'vigilante', 'nothing', 'will.But', 'instead', 'taking', 'most', 'directed', 'approached', 'I.E', 'waltzing', 'Saint', 'estate', 'killing', 'everyone', 'Castle', 'campaign', 'misdirection', 'making', 'Howard', 'turn', 'best', 'friend', 'wife', 'Frank', 'rest', 'Saint', 'syndicate', 'out', 'classic', 'punisher', 'fashion.Hensleigh', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'balls', 'wall', 'blood', 'bath', 'action', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'less', 'money', 'Hensleigh', 'create', 'more', 'classic', 'action', 'pieces', 'similar', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'style', 'tone', 'early', 'Peckinpah', 'Leone', 'films', 'had', 'plenty', 'violence', 'was', 'largely', 'bloodless', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'where', 'idea', 'was', 'less', 'more', 'Castle', 'massacre', 'was', 'mostly', 'bloodless', 'holding', 'out', 'climactic', 'shootout', 'Saint', 'club.Overall', 'Hensleigh', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'limited', 'number', 'recourses', 'had', 'performance', 'Jane', 'Travolta', 'others', 'up', 'lack', 'action']",N/A

I don't think I'm alone when I proclaim, ""Long live Lundgren!""Yes, you heard me. I know it may seem like I've stooped to the gravel bottom, but I mean it. Dolph Lundgren was so eloquently dreadful in his depiction of the Mafia fanny-paddling badass in the original film. A grin is forming just thinking about that 1989 classic in cheese-ball cinema. For those of you who appreciated Lundgren's work as Ivan Drago in ""Rocky IV,"" you ain't seen nothin' until you've rented this preposterous bomb.I recommend setting the line, ""I will break you,"" on the back burner because it will be replaced with ""I punish the guilty.""Anyway, the sets and special effects in the original version of ""The Punisher"" were unfathomably horrendous.

Toss in some fight sequences marred by out-of-place sound effects and no conception of gravitational pull, not to mention triple-digit death counts, and you've got yourself a chucklelicious good time.Certainly the remake has much higher production values and slightly superior acting, but it sorely lacks the flair of Lundgren and Louis Gossett Jr. I look at it as a slicked down version of the original.To put things in perspective, the first film knew it blew poppy seed, and for that I've provided a place for the film in my aortic valve. The remake thinks of itself as clutching the tagline, ""Nominated for 13 Academy Awards including Best Picture, `The Punisher' is here, and he sure as HELL ain't happy."" All right, the movie can attest to a handful of crack-ups, but on the whole it took itself too damned seriously for my liking.For those of you who take comic books seriously and expect a sober big screen adaptation of your preferred strip, I sincerely apologize. It's just a personal penchant of mine that comic adaptations have an air of ridiculousness because the definition of the word ""comic"" does kind of hint at this necessity.",1,`The Punisher' simply lacks Lundgren,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,2570,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'major', 'problem', 'had', 'Punisher', 'was', 'not', 'half-baked', 'attempt', 'film', 'noir', 'lame-brained', 'viciousness', 'even', 'director', 'punishing', 'assault', 'viewer', 'intelligence', ""'m"", 'referring', 'here', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Hensleigh', 'uncanny', 'skill', 'jack-hammering', 'dramatic', 'points', 'home', 'rumble', 'thunder', 'streak', 'lightning', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'could', ""n't"", 'lead', 'believe', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'sadistic', 'white-knuckled', 'protagonist', 'trouble', 'had', 'Jane', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'superhero', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'was', 'bad', 'rather', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'alone', 'when', 'proclaim', 'Long', 'live', 'Lundgren', 'Yes', 'heard', 'know', 'may', 'seem', ""'ve"", 'stooped', 'gravel', 'bottom', 'mean', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'was', 'so', 'eloquently', 'dreadful', 'depiction', 'Mafia', 'fanny-paddling', 'badass', 'original', 'film', 'grin', 'forming', 'just', 'thinking', '1989', 'classic', 'cheese-ball', 'cinema', 'who', 'appreciated', 'Lundgren', 'work', 'Ivan', 'Drago', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'ai', ""n't"", 'seen', 'nothin', ""'ve"", 'rented', 'preposterous', 'bomb.I', 'recommend', 'setting', 'line', 'will', 'break', 'back', 'burner', 'will', 'be', 'replaced', 'punish', 'guilty', 'Anyway', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'original', 'version', 'Punisher', 'were', 'unfathomably', 'horrendous', 'movie', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'set', 'Killer', 'Klowns', 'Outer', 'Space', 'Toss', 'fight', 'sequences', 'marred', 'out-of-place', 'sound', 'effects', 'conception', 'gravitational', 'pull', 'not', 'mention', 'triple-digit', 'death', 'counts', ""'ve"", 'got', 'chucklelicious', 'good', 'time.Certainly', 'remake', 'much', 'higher', 'production', 'values', 'slightly', 'superior', 'acting', 'sorely', 'flair', 'Lundgren', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr', 'look', 'slicked', 'down', 'version', 'original.To', 'put', 'things', 'perspective', 'first', 'film', 'knew', 'blew', 'poppy', 'seed', ""'ve"", 'provided', 'place', 'film', 'aortic', 'valve', 'remake', 'thinks', 'clutching', 'tagline', 'Nominated', '13', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Punisher', 'here', 'sure', 'HELL', 'ai', ""n't"", 'happy', 'right', 'movie', 'can', 'attest', 'handful', 'crack-ups', 'whole', 'took', 'too', 'damned', 'seriously', 'liking.For', 'who', 'take', 'comic', 'books', 'seriously', 'expect', 'sober', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'preferred', 'strip', 'sincerely', 'apologize', 'just', 'personal', 'penchant', 'mine', 'comic', 'adaptations', 'have', 'air', 'ridiculousness', 'definition', 'word', 'comic', 'kind', 'hint', 'necessity']",N/A

It is true that the plot is not really original.  The plot is basically the plot of Mad Max.  A scene in this movie is even inspired by the scene in Mad Max where Max runs to his family just after they have been run over.  But what this movie lacks in an original plot, it makes up for in other ways.  Thomas Jane is great as The Punisher and I don't think there is anyone else who could have played him better.  In fact, I'm not sure why Jane wasn't chosen to play parts such as Batman or Spiderman in the past.  He's what a superhero should be.  The movie is refreshing in that, as the director explains in the commentary track, there are virtually no CGI effects.  The movie is stripped down and raw with nothing extra added, just like the Punisher himself.  I really get tired of looking at phony CGI effects.  This movie was shot old-school and is meant play like an old sam peckinpaw movie.  The movie has a great soundtrack and there is some suprisingly good acting in this movie, especially from the supporting cast.  I think the critics unfairly bashed this movie.

WHAT THE HELL?!? the real punisher (or at least garth ennis' punisher which is the only one worth reading) would never do that. his whole purpose is to kill mobsters. i've read issues where hes blown out men's kneecaps and put them through woodshredders to get the information he wants. the stuios wanted to make an action flick with a hero you can sympathize with. but thats the thing.

836438,A3SCWIOUVUN05I,B0002IQMAM,Jared Presley,"[3, 8]","Yes, I did not enjoy the movie overall. It had little potential. The main problem with thefilm is that it takes the basis of the origin away. We do not see a Vietnam veteran here, but aF.B.I. agent. Literally, the screenwriter make Frank Castle manhood less.The script is merely copy and paste work from Punisher stories (Welcome Back Frank, Punisher Year One, etc) slopped down, with no real background or overall consideration. Too much is crammed where it shouldn't be. More time is needed for a few charecters, not many. (Was it really nessisary to have The Russian in this movie?) It literally feels he was just set there, John Travolta literally says after a argument, ""Ok, get the Russian."" In the comics, you see a huge swat team get killed by The Russian before he meets castle. That's scary. Mentioning his name isn't. Don't assume everyone's read all the comics.It would of been sweet for this movie to have a period piece, set right after Vietnam, and showing in the beggining his transformation from the horrors of nam to the death of his family in Central Park. The film makers decide to set the story to today and make it more commercial. (Hint, it sucks more).The film rushes too much after his family's death. There is no real time to mourn, or even to really care about the characters. The film rushes itself too much to avoid being boring. It's not boring or slow, but it is dull the whole way through.Thomas Jane actually played the Punisher decently, and could of played him better with better direction. The film makers don't take the character seriously. This is a result of a quick transformation of Frank Castle before and after with little time devoted to ""Why is he the Punisher?""Yes, we see his family get killed, but there isn't a Nam factor, or a past event, that would make you think Castle is demented enough to become the Punisher. There is simply not enough on his past to really convince us he would, or is capable of this type of thing. Yeah, you could be in the FBI, but that doesn't make you a psychopath.John Travolta's charecter is even worse. A very bad cast choice, he neither scared or intimitated me. I could name off a 100 actors at least who could of played this part better than Travolta. It still remains a mystery of why they casted him in this role.I know this is the Punisher, but there should be some concern, or some INTEREST in the charecters. There's a difference in not caring about a charecter and not being interested in him. The film makers and the studio needs to learn this.It just feels more of a '2004' movie with current bands on the soundtrack, riddled with random violence, with no real substance. With every good marvel movie, there's around 5 bad ones. Recently, I saw The 'Unfantastic Four"" Lets hope X-Men 3 heals the wounds.

I was a Spiderman fan, and every once in a while got into Superman and a few others. Having not really read the Punisher, I loved this movie.

One of my only problems with this film was John Travolta. I prefer him in roles as a soft spoken badass, in movies like this when he gets agitated, his voice starts getting high pitched and he starts getting annoying.

This movie, although violent and some might think silly at times, is pure revenge fun. This is another one of those if you don't take it to seriously and enjoy it for what it is movies. How can anyone go into this expecting some deep, moving drama with 5-star perfomances? no-no, not this one. It's pure action from beginning to end with a few breaks for some character development, which was another surprise as it was done very well.Anyone remember Deep Blue Sea? The shark movie that 90 percent of the world thought was terrible? (3 stars from me, silly fun) Well Tom Jane played the hero in that one, and he plays the hero in this one as well, and you know what? The man needs a little work. Don't get me wrong, it's not as if he is horrible, but he really needs to work on his emotion and expressions, as in GET SOME!!!! But it's not like he needs to talk in this, just take his shirt off and kill alot, and I do mean alot, of bad guys, which he does fine. I also believe he was Cameron Diaz's love interest in The Sweetest Thing, but I need to see that again before I can comment on his performance.Is it me, or does John Travolta not rule as a bad guy? Everytime he plays the villian he absolutely engulfs the role, adding just the right expressions and mannerisms to really make the character a complete heartless ass. Even in the very poor Battlefield Earth, he was awesome as the main willian, but alas, nothing could have saved that disaster.The supporting actors are all pretty decent, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is the weakest of the bunch, but her roomates are priceless and added alot of touching humor to there roles. Also Kevein Nash is terrific in a small role as ""the russian"" He is hired to kill Jane's character, Frank Castle, he doesn't say a word, but the fight scene those two have is one of the best I can remember recently.Plot? please, like you all haven't heard this one before, bad dudes kill his family, (twist here, his WHOLE family) and he goes on a major revenge spree. But who cares about the plot, the violence and Travolta are the big attractions here, and both shine quite well.So, don't be too hard on it, I know alot of the comic book fans were not pleased with final product, but the movies rarely do the comic or book justice, but the action and some decent acting with a touch of funny here and there should more then hold you for the 123 minutes this is on, enjoy.acting...........3 stars, Travolta rocks, Jane and Stamos not so muchdirecting.......3.5 stars, Not too bad for a comic book moviespecial effects....4 stars, Lots of explosions, seriously, lots.action rating.....4 stars, see above.

Druley,"[0, 0]","I have always been one who hates it when someone tells me I have to read the book for a film to get the full understanding of all that transpires but in this case it is absolutely true. Having read the novel a few weeks before I had many expectations of what I was going to see in the movie and they never came about.This brings me to my next issues with this potentially great film. This is by far the worst edited movie I've ever encountered (and I've seen some VERY poorly edited ones) (Come to think of it, the director wasn't all that good either). You can actually see points where a dialogue you didn't see just ended or one is about to begin but not shown. And I understand this movie is already 2:06 long but would another 30 minutes have bothered anyone if giant plot holes were filled in? (Just one example: in the novel, Frank's old FBI pal Jimmy Street has a gambling and alcohol problem and this is what's used as leverage by Howard Saint to gain classified information and ultimately lead to the slaughter of Frank's family.)Overall, the acting, story and action sequences were quite good but the lower budget shows its ugly head (unlike Spider-Man, Hulk, etc... with the unbelievably large budgets) in the direction, editing and quality of the film.As far as fans of the comic are concerned, other than the location and how the family was killed (and who) the character portrayal was dead on. They even used my favorite all-time scene (from ""Punisher: War Journal"" #1, I think) where he tortures a captive with a blowtorch.

836449,A3BUFAGPDKONX1,B0002IQMAM,Jeff Howard,"[2, 2]","This is one of the better Marvel adaptations from comic book to the big screen. Nowhere near as good as SPIDERMAN but it does draw heavily and satisfyingly from its comic book roots. Most of the changes to the character are improvements. Frank Castle is an ex-FBI agent.When Frank Castle's entire family is wiped out by a crime lord, Castle dons the skull and becomes the Punisher.  This Punisher is firmly grounded in reality with none of the superhero trappings of his early Spiderman appearance in issue 139.  With appearances by The Russian and Harry Heck, comic book fans will not be disappointed.The violence is rough and graphic and Tom Jane keeps the character real.  But the real treat in this DVD comes in the extras.  There is a fantastic short on the origin of the Punisher as told by the creator, writers, and artists who brought him to life.  Watching those men lovingly tell how the Punisher came to be is almost better than the film.Next is the interview with the cover artist, called Drawing Blood: Bradstreet Style.  It is clear from the film visuals that the director went out of his way to incorporate the grittiness of the controversial comic about the hero that kills people.  Fascinating.For the music fan there is a bonus CD containing three cuts from the soundtrack: Drowning Pool - Step Up; Seven Wiser - Sick; and Edgewater - Eyes Wired Shut.For the comic book fan, there is a small comic book prequel, specifically created for the DVD release.Just an awesome value.",4,EXTRAS MAKE THIS DVD A GEM,1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,1493,"['one', 'better', 'Marvel', 'adaptations', 'comic', 'book', 'big', 'screen', 'Nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'SPIDERMAN', 'draw', 'heavily', 'satisfyingly', 'comic', 'book', 'roots', 'Most', 'changes', 'character', 'are', 'improvements', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'ex-FBI', 'agent.When', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'entire', 'family', 'wiped', 'out', 'crime', 'lord', 'Castle', 'skull', 'Punisher', 'Punisher', 'firmly', 'grounded', 'reality', 'none', 'superhero', 'trappings', 'early', 'Spiderman', 'appearance', 'issue', '139', 'appearances', 'Russian', 'Harry', 'Heck', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'violence', 'rough', 'graphic', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'character', 'real', 'real', 'treat', 'DVD', 'extras', 'fantastic', 'short', 'origin', 'Punisher', 'told', 'creator', 'writers', 'artists', 'who', 'brought', 'life', 'Watching', 'men', 'lovingly', 'tell', 'how', 'Punisher', 'came', 'be', 'almost', 'better', 'film.Next', 'interview', 'cover', 'artist', 'called', 'Drawing', 'Blood', 'Bradstreet', 'Style', 'clear', 'film', 'visuals', 'director', 'went', 'way', 'incorporate', 'grittiness', 'controversial', 'comic', 'hero', 'people', 'music', 'fan', 'bonus', 'CD', 'containing', 'three', 'cuts', 'soundtrack', 'Drowning', 'Pool', 'Step', 'Up', 'Seven', 'Wiser', 'Sick', 'Edgewater', 'Eyes', 'Wired', 'Shut.For', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'small', 'comic', 'book', 'prequel', 'specifically', 'created', 'DVD', 'release.Just', 'awesome', 'value']",N/A

They also hated Daredevil.  Now, I will admit the transition of Punisher and Daredevil to the screen was not to be an earth shattering experience.  I mean c'mon, they were both released during weak times of the movie going season.  They were both second tier heroes of Marvel.  C'mon, they only spend a lot of money on the high profile characters like the XMEN, Spiderman, Hulk and the upcoming Fantastic Four.  I went to see this movie to support the Marvel Comic industry, I didn't think it looked that bad and I wasn't expecting much.  I was entertained to say the least.  Yes it was weak in some places but otherwise good.  Thomas Jane did a tremendous job playing the part.  He showed a finite difference between his initial character and the one that emerges from the horrible tragedy that he endures.  His family is brutally murdered in a vicious scene of gangland style shootings.  He survives, but comes out not quite himself, understandably.  The problem with the movie is that everything around him is not quite up to par with Thomas Jane's performance.  The tone of the movie is at times a little campy, and that just doesn't fly with this character.  He's dark, violent, gritty, obsessed and a little nuts.  Think of Batman with just guns, no gadgets and no desire to keep his identity secret.  Unfortunately, the whole `make friends with the off center neighbors' thing doesn't work with someone who is supposed to be a loner and makes things a little awkward.  And even though Travolta plays his character seriously, he's still a bit over the top.  What does work with Jane's performance is the intelligent manner in which he 'Punishes' the bad guys.  Die Hard fans of the comic might say this is in contrast with the character who goes in guns blazing and kills everyone.  But the alteration is a sign of the times and how this character actually changed in comics.  Hopefully with Jane's performance, this franchise won't die.  As of now, a lot can be done, and it could be done well if given to the right creators.  If anyone thinks this version is worse then the Dolph Lungren version, they need to rethink their perspective.Update 10/13/2005:  I watched the making of documentary on this movie and I found it amazing that the director/writer was given a 30 million dollar budget and a 60 day shooting schedule.  That's an abomination.  Considering the other movies Marvel has made, they didn't put much into this one, and it most likely contributed to it's less than stellar end product.

I was right.This is an aborted attempt at translating a very different kind of ""hero"" a la Marvel comics to the screen.  It had been done before, and it was pretty bad then too.  (Anyone remember Ivan Drago from ""Rocky IV""?  He played The Punisher a little better than Tom Jane in this movie, and that should be all you need to know about the quality of the acting here.)The job of ""The Punisher"" in this film is to strut around without a shirt on, act like a darker Toby Keith/gunslingin' coolguy, and take vengeance on the people who murdered his family.  Keep in mind he's been shot five, six times on the orders of John Travolta (he's a gangster with a big car lot and people who dress in all black).  Was he at least seriously injured.  Nah.  Some voodoo witch doctor black guy who just happened to be around when the slaughter of his family took place and was also miraculously unharmed fixed him in a day or two.Nope. Frank Castle, this seemingly invincible cop who is bent on smoking cigarettes and drinking hard liquor while plotting revenge, doesn't even have a scar on this body after being blown up and shot multiple times.He is miraculously delivered back to the exact city in a very short time and begins a game of bloodthirsty ""intrigue"" using one of the villain's henchmen so obvious and predictable it makes Andy Warhol's movie ""Sleep""seem unpredictable.But the other people who live in the apartment with Jane's Punisher--fatboy, loser, and reformed heroin addict potential love interest--put the nails in the already descending coffin of this awful excuse for a movie.  They are so badly drawn and so badly acted that you wonder if they are going to fall off the screen or start laughing wildly.  They try a few ""Leave It To Beaver"" moments in between Castle's drinking and intent haunted gaze on his firearms.But he is so haunted, vengeful, so cool that he can't work up too much dialogue with them.  That might have required some acting.  He's the demented silent type, a less talented Gary Cooper with a different agenda.  A big Russian guy (an extra from Barnum and Bailey's?) and Castle have a big brawl, each suffering injuries that would knock anyone unconscious or kill them very quickly.  Another thing: The Punisher, though mortal as anyone else, does not seem to have the problem of blood loss.In a completely cold, bland, and unmoving series of Cowboy Draw Your Gun pastiche, Castle takes his vengeance on the ever absent Howard Saint (John Travolta is who you see, but he's supposed to playing a role with that name).  Then, ripping off ""The Crow"" (an actually good movie about vigilantism), he sets ablaze the ominously luxuriant parking lot of this arch criminal.""The Punisher"" is one of the most disturbing and well written characters in the history of Marvel.

836455,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B0002IQMAM,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[0, 0]","The Punish stars Thomas Jane (61, Deep Blue Sea, Dreamcatcher) as a former agent who's out for revenge. His wife and son were killed by the thug's of a power man (John Travolta) and he was left for dead. Jane makes this movie 100% and is why it's watchable. He can try too hard to look tough and sound tough at times. Still though he pulls off the part well when a lot of comic fans doubted that he could. The movie is dark and violent and basically can be compared to other revenge movies like Mad Max and DarkMan. Hell even how his wife and son die is a rip-off from how Max's wife and son die in Mad Max.I'd like to see a sequel though because Jane does the part well. Although this wasn't a great movie a sequel has more potential because it can be more than just a revenge movie. With a better a script and Jane in the role a sequel could be great. John Travolta is a good actor but as Saint, it's jut basically a walk on role. Anyone could've played the part. Plus he has been better, he's not terrible but he's just dry in the role and does nothing for it. I think a lesser known actor would've been better for the part. Will Patton (Gone in 60 Seconds) is in better  villain form though as his head henchman. I actually think Rebecca Romijn-Stamos shines as well as a waitress who falls for Jane. She gets called a bad actress a lot but I've seen worse.  Roy Scheider is also good in a small role as the Punisher's father in the opening scenes.Some of the action in this movie is fun too. I like Jane's big fight with a huge hired hitman named the Russian (WWE's Kevin Nash). Also is a clever scene where  a killer with a guitar sings to him and says I'll sing this song to you at your funeral. Those 2 scenes are what work the most. You've seen better comic book movies with a lighter tone and more humor but fans of the comic should still like what Jane brings to the role.",3,Thomas Jane is the Punisher,1094774400,"09 10, 2004",2004,1883,"['Punish', 'stars', 'Thomas', 'Jane', '61', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'Dreamcatcher', 'former', 'agent', 'who', 'out', 'revenge', 'wife', 'son', 'were', 'killed', 'thug', 'power', 'man', 'John', 'Travolta', 'was', 'left', 'dead', 'Jane', 'movie', '100', '%', 'why', 'watchable', 'can', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'look', 'tough', 'sound', 'tough', 'times', 'Still', 'part', 'well', 'when', 'lot', 'comic', 'fans', 'doubted', 'could', 'movie', 'dark', 'violent', 'basically', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'other', 'revenge', 'movies', 'Mad', 'Max', 'DarkMan', 'Hell', 'even', 'how', 'wife', 'son', 'die', 'rip-off', 'how', 'Max', 'wife', 'son', 'die', 'Mad', 'Max.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'sequel', 'Jane', 'part', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'sequel', 'more', 'potential', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'revenge', 'movie', 'better', 'script', 'Jane', 'role', 'sequel', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'John', 'Travolta', 'good', 'actor', 'Saint', 'jut', 'basically', 'walk', 'role', 'Anyone', 'could', ""'ve"", 'played', 'part', 'been', 'better', 'not', 'terrible', 'just', 'dry', 'role', 'nothing', 'think', 'lesser', 'known', 'actor', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'part', 'Will', 'Patton', 'Gone', '60', 'Seconds', 'better', 'villain', 'form', 'head', 'henchman', 'actually', 'think', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'shines', 'as', 'well', 'waitress', 'who', 'Jane', 'called', 'bad', 'actress', 'lot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'also', 'good', 'small', 'role', 'Punisher', 'father', 'opening', 'scenes.Some', 'action', 'movie', 'fun', 'too', 'like', 'Jane', 'big', 'fight', 'huge', 'hired', 'hitman', 'named', 'Russian', 'WWE', 'Kevin', 'Nash', 'Also', 'clever', 'scene', 'where', 'killer', 'guitar', 'sings', ""'ll"", 'sing', 'song', 'funeral', '2', 'scenes', 'are', 'what', 'work', 'most', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'lighter', 'tone', 'more', 'humor', 'fans', 'comic', 'should', 'still', 'like', 'what', 'Jane', 'role']",N/A
836456,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B0002IQMAM,Joe Carugati,"[0, 0]","After seeing ""The Punisher"", I felt really good.  The film, which is based off the graphic Marvel comic books, is a great revenge film and you really feel for the person seeking vengeance - or should I say ""punishment"".  Going into the film, I didn't expect much for two reasons.First off, it sounded like every other superhero film, where our ""superhero"" fights against evil after one of his family is killed (""Spider-Man""'s Uncle Ben, or ""Batman""'s family).  The idea was getting old during films.  ""The Punisher"" had the same concept.Secondly, it was ""another"" superhero film.  I enjoyed the ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" films, and ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" brought superheroes back ont the map, but technically that wasn't a good thing.  Since then, we've had duds such as ""Hulk"" (too much CGI), ""Daredevil"" (too much Ben Affleck), and ""Catwoman"" (just a mess).  When I saw the posters for this one, I felt like we had another piece of trash coming.I was wrong of course.  The film is perfect in every way.  It contradicts both my statements above.  Yet, that will be explained later.The plot concerns Frank Castle (Tom Jane) who has just finished his last assignment with the Force and in doing so, killed the billionaire, Howard Saint's (John Travolta), son accidentally in a little skirmish.  Frank retires his job and goes with his wife and son to a family reunion.  Howard Saint decides to take out Castle and his whole extended family.  After his men kill Castle's wife and son, they shoot him in the chest and blow him into the water.  He's nursed back to help, then he loads up, and begins to dish out the punishment.Going back to my two concerns before seeing this movie, my worries weren't even found here.  First off, I really cared about the family and I knew they were going to die (how else would there be a movie).  It's always harder and harder to watch them go.Secondly, I stressed my feelings about all these ""superhero"" movies now, but this one is different.  The man isn't mutated, doesn't spin webs, or doesn't fly throughout the night.  He's a regular man who doesn't have anything to lose.  His confidence and anger are his only powers.Finally, this movie isn't PG-13, which in a way is great, because if it was, we probably wouldn't get the full feeling of how this guy is dealing with everything.  The family massacre isn't bloody, but at the same time, it's disturbing.  It does get violent though, so be prepared.  Also, I don't believe I saw one scene of CGI in this film, and congrats to the director.  It made the film more realistic and was a great way to keep the story gritty.The acting in the film is outstanding.  Tom Jane is the Punisher.  That's all I can say.  John Travolta turns in an awesome performance.  His scene with Will Patton in his house is great.  The supporting actors and actresses all did a great job and made the film very good.The direction by Jonathon Hensleigh is pretty good.  He doesn't move the film at a breakneck pace, but let's us get into our characters so we can understand their decisions later on.  When the action scenes hit though, he puts a lot of style into them.  They're a great action sequences in this movie and is mainly to do with his direction.Overall, this film is very good.  It's probably my favorite ""superhero"" film.  It's got great characters, story, and it doesn't pull the punches with the violence, and in a way that helps the story.Rated R for very strong bloody violence/some gore, sexual content, brief nudity, and some language",5,The Punisher,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,3516,"['seeing', 'Punisher', 'felt', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'based', 'off', 'graphic', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'books', 'great', 'revenge', 'film', 'really', 'feel', 'person', 'seeking', 'vengeance', 'should', 'say', 'punishment', 'Going', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'two', 'reasons.First', 'sounded', 'other', 'superhero', 'film', 'where', 'superhero', 'fights', 'evil', 'one', 'family', 'killed', 'Spider-Man', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Batman', 'family', 'idea', 'was', 'getting', 'old', 'films', 'Punisher', 'had', 'same', 'concept.Secondly', 'was', 'superhero', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'films', 'Spider-Man', 'X-Men', 'brought', 'superheroes', 'back', 'map', 'technically', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'thing', 'then', ""'ve"", 'had', 'duds', 'such', 'Hulk', 'too', 'much', 'CGI', 'Daredevil', 'too', 'much', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Catwoman', 'just', 'mess', 'When', 'saw', 'posters', 'one', 'felt', 'had', 'piece', 'trash', 'coming.I', 'was', 'wrong', 'course', 'film', 'perfect', 'way', 'statements', 'will', 'be', 'explained', 'later.The', 'plot', 'concerns', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'who', 'just', 'finished', 'last', 'assignment', 'Force', 'doing', 'so', 'killed', 'billionaire', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'John', 'Travolta', 'son', 'accidentally', 'little', 'skirmish', 'Frank', 'job', 'wife', 'son', 'family', 'reunion', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'take', 'out', 'Castle', 'whole', 'extended', 'family', 'men', 'kill', 'Castle', 'wife', 'son', 'shoot', 'chest', 'blow', 'water', 'nursed', 'back', 'help', 'then', 'up', 'dish', 'out', 'punishment.Going', 'back', 'two', 'concerns', 'seeing', 'movie', 'worries', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'found', 'here', 'First', 'really', 'cared', 'family', 'knew', 'were', 'going', 'die', 'how', 'else', 'would', 'there', 'be', 'movie', 'always', 'harder', 'harder', 'watch', 'go.Secondly', 'stressed', 'feelings', 'superhero', 'movies', 'now', 'one', 'different', 'man', ""n't"", 'mutated', ""n't"", 'spin', 'webs', ""n't"", 'fly', 'night', 'regular', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'lose', 'confidence', 'anger', 'are', 'only', 'powers.Finally', 'movie', ""n't"", 'PG-13', 'way', 'great', 'was', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'feeling', 'how', 'guy', 'dealing', 'everything', 'family', 'massacre', ""n't"", 'bloody', 'same', 'time', 'disturbing', 'get', 'violent', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'saw', 'one', 'scene', 'CGI', 'film', 'congrats', 'director', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'realistic', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'keep', 'story', 'gritty.The', 'acting', 'film', 'outstanding', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'Punisher', 'can', 'say', 'John', 'Travolta', 'awesome', 'performance', 'scene', 'Will', 'Patton', 'house', 'great', 'supporting', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'made', 'film', 'very', 'good.The', 'direction', 'Jonathon', 'Hensleigh', 'pretty', 'good', ""n't"", 'move', 'film', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'let', 'get', 'characters', 'can', 'understand', 'decisions', 'later', 'When', 'action', 'scenes', 'hit', 'though', 'lot', 'style', ""'re"", 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'movie', 'mainly', 'do', 'direction.Overall', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'probably', 'favorite', 'superhero', 'film', 'got', 'great', 'characters', 'story', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'violence', 'way', 'story.Rated', 'R', 'very', 'strong', 'bloody', 'violence/some', 'gore', 'sexual', 'content', 'brief', 'nudity', 'language']",N/A

Foster ""knightemerald""","[10, 14]","Be warned, I saw this in the theatre, so I have no idea what ""goodies"" the DVD will include, so I can only really give my opinion on the movie itself.That being said, I thought this movie was pretty good.  But, if you are expecting a comic book movie adaptation on the par with Spider-man or X-men, then you will be disappointed.  Think more along the lines of Daredevil, good but not spectacular.  It seemed to pick good parts from various popular comic book storylines and then ""hollywood cheesed"" it up a bit.  If you read the comics and have seen this movie or Daredevil, you'll know exactly what I am talking about.  Don't get me wrong, I went and saw this movie as a MOVIE and not as a faithful adaptation of the comic book.  It was good, just not great.  I was entertained, and I guess thats all I can ask for.  I just had a problem with the way that Travoltas character died, and really wasn't happy with his character portrayal in general.  Normally, I really like him as an actor, but this movie he just seemed... stiff, for lack of a better word.  The real shining star of this movie, however, is Thomas Jayne, who did a fantastic job in the lead role of Frank Castle (aka the Punisher).  I had never really heard of him before this, but he was superb.If you have never read any of the great ""Punisher"" comics in your life, you will still enjoy this movie as a good action flick.  But for you fanboys out there, it heavily revamps his origin and then borrows alot from Garth Ennis recent storylines from his Punisher mini series that came out a few years ago.  By the way, you should pick up his new ongoing Punisher series out now, it's great, but I digress.So all in all, it's not a bad popcorn flick.  Good action, pretty good storyline, some dark humor thrown in there, a little suspense, and the acting was not bad (I just hope this movie doesn't re-kill Travoltas career).  Defintely worth renting at least once, and then you can decide for yourself.  I will definitely pick this one up when it comes out in September.",4,Pretty good movie for some...,1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,2035,"['Be', 'warned', 'saw', 'theatre', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'goodies', 'DVD', 'will', 'include', 'can', 'only', 'really', 'give', 'opinion', 'movie', 'being', 'said', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'expecting', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'par', 'Spider-man', 'X-men', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Think', 'more', 'lines', 'Daredevil', 'good', 'not', 'spectacular', 'seemed', 'pick', 'good', 'parts', 'various', 'popular', 'comic', 'book', 'storylines', 'then', 'hollywood', 'cheesed', 'up', 'bit', 'read', 'comics', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'Daredevil', ""'ll"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'went', 'saw', 'movie', 'MOVIE', 'not', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'good', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'was', 'entertained', 'guess', 'can', 'ask', 'just', 'had', 'problem', 'way', 'Travoltas', 'character', 'died', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'character', 'portrayal', 'general', 'Normally', 'really', 'like', 'actor', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', 'stiff', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'real', 'shining', 'star', 'movie', 'however', 'Thomas', 'Jayne', 'who', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'lead', 'role', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Punisher', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'heard', 'was', 'superb.If', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'great', 'Punisher', 'comics', 'life', 'will', 'still', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'good', 'action', 'flick', 'fanboys', 'there', 'heavily', 'origin', 'then', 'alot', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'recent', 'storylines', 'Punisher', 'mini', 'series', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'way', 'should', 'pick', 'up', 'new', 'ongoing', 'Punisher', 'series', 'out', 'now', 'great', 'digress.So', 'not', 'bad', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'Good', 'action', 'pretty', 'good', 'storyline', 'dark', 'humor', 'thrown', 'there', 'little', 'suspense', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'hope', 'movie', ""n't"", 're-kill', 'Travoltas', 'career', 'Defintely', 'worth', 'renting', 'least', 'once', 'then', 'can', 'decide', 'will', 'definitely', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'when', 'out', 'September']",N/A

Truncale ""warriorwriter""","[0, 0]","I have become interested lately in the Marvel Comic book hero, &#34;The Punisher.&#34;  I have read a few of the comic book Punisher stories as well as seeing two Punisher movies, one being &#34;War Journal Punisher&#34; and this one. &#34;The Punisher&#34; staring Tom Jane as the Punisher and John Travolta as the head of a criminal gang provides a short historical back ground of &#34;The Punisher character.  This movie can be considered a good introduction to how Frank Castle, an ex-military instructor and FBI agent, becomes known as &#34;The Punisher.&#34;This movie starts out a little slow but after about a 1/2 hour, the action heats up when the head of a crime group, John Travolta, orders his thugs to kill Frank Castle's entire family.  They do just that, killing Frank's father, mother, wife and young son.  They also think they killed Frank, but they failed and now it is their turn to receive justice for their crimes.  At first, &#34;The Punisher&#34; seems a little hesitant to kill his enemies, but in the end, Frank becomes the ruthless &#34;Punisher&#34; giving the bad guys a taste of their own medicine as hunts them down and kills every one of the thugs.One of the reasons &#34;The Punisher&#34; Marvel Comic character appeals to me is that he does not possess any super powers, but he does have an expertise with rifles, handguns , bows and knives. He also justifies his actions by claiming it is not &#34;vengeances&#34; he seeks for the thugs, but he merely provides the correct punishment for their crimes, which the American  justice system often fails to do.In conclusion, to  be honest, I liked this film which was came out in 2004,  but I liked the &#34;War Zone Punisher&#34; that came out in 2008, starring Ray Stevenson much better than this one, even though I gave both DVDs 4 stars.  Nevertheless, if you are into &#34;The Punisher&#34; series you should check out both of these DVDs.Rating 4 Stars.  Joseph J.

So it starts off with Frank Castle's last day with the FBI agent & a guy guy is accidentally shot & killed it turns out to be John Travolta's character's son so he want the man dealt with but Travolta's characters wife puts a hit on all of them. While on Family reunion Frank & his wife & kid are there EVERYONE is a target & the men think they killed Frank Castle but he's still alive he returns to Tampa for Revenge & basically to end The Mob lead by John Travolta's character. There are a few flaws I though the Thomas Jane's fight with Kevin Nash was cheesy. I wish it could've been set in New York but I can understand why. I have the Blu Ray version & the longer version the longer version adds 17 minutes that do help a little with the plot.

836468,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B0002IQMAM,JRP,"[0, 0]","Welcome to this, this is another review in 20 years ago 2004 in film review series & I am doing a review & retrospective for the underrated 2004 Punisher movie. If I go long with this review forgive me I will go long. It was made for $30 million on it's opening weekend it made $13 million in it's full The US run it made $33 million & with worldwide ticket sales it made $54 million. It was directed by Jonathon Hensleigh He deserves to get more directing gigs & he wrote the script to my favorite Die Hard movie Die Hard With A Vengence. The movie stars Thomas Jane as Frank Castle The Punisher, John Travolta as Howard S ain't & Rebecca Romjin as Joan. The story is this F B I Agent named Frank Castle yes I know they changed Frank Castle's background again. Anyway he's undercover doing this arms deal where 1 thing leads to another & this guy is killed & Frank Castle fakes his death being undercover. Castle & his Family are leaving The States to go to London. The man who was killed is 1 of Howard S ain't's Son is & he finds out about Frank Castle he's at this Family Reunion in Puerto Rico S ain't sends his men including his right hand man Quentin Glass to deal with Frank Castle but his Wife Olivia wants the entire Family killed. Now there's an extended edition that shows 1 of Frank Castle's Friends on The Tampa PD rats him out if you ever see The Extended Edition on DVD go ahead & buy it cause it's worth watching. Anyway Frank is spending time with his Family along with his Mother & Father & other extended family & you get to know Frank's Wife Maria & Son Will more. Which the scene where Quentin Glass & his group of thugs where they're killing Frank Castle's Family has always been hard to watch cause it's not just his Wife & Kids like in the comic book or even in the 89 movie it's the extended family that does show how sick The S aint Crime Syndicate is especially where they kill a little girl. You have Frank's Dad killed when he's trying to fight these group of men. Maria takes Will with her & they try to escape & they're chased by this group & they cause them to crash the truck they are in & they're hurt they try to get help & try to get to the dock to & escape the boat but they're ran over & Frank finds them dead & Thomas Jane does a great job in this scene he sells it when he starts crying. Which people complain Why is The Punisher crying it's not like that in the comic sniffle sniffle."" CAUSE HIS WIFE & SON HAVE BEEN KILLED! Quentin Glass shows up along with Howard S ain't's other Son John & the actor who plays him plays both John & Bobby The Son who was killed at the beginning of the movie. Frank Castle tries firing a Shotgun but it's out of shells he's beaten up John & tells him that Mom & Dad send their regards & before he shoots Frank he tells him this time the bullets aren't blanks. Quentin pours gas all on the dock & sets it on fire the blast knocks Frank off of the dock into the ocean. This local Fisherman finds Frank Castle where he heals after some time he grabs his Father Guns heads back to Tampa & he also takes this Skull shirt his Son had bought for him. He gets a GTO & moves into this ran down apartment ran by a lady named Joan & 2 other people live their Dave & Bumpo which they're ok I don't complain about them how a lot of people do. Frank's preping & working up a plan to go after Howard S ain't. He takes this guy named Mickey who is a stooge for The S ain't's where you have a blow torch scene & this scene is funny where Frank Castle has this Blow Torch & has this Popsicle he tells him that he is going to feel cold as it burns your skin & it's going to smell like burning meat he takes Popsicle to Mickey's back which taking a Blow Torch to a steak & it's hilarious scene. Mickey agree's to help cause he hates The S aint's he gives Frank Castle all their schedules they go by day to day so he starts playing mind games with them which is a cool trait cause it leads into Frank Castle losing his humanity. He finds out Quentin Glass is in the closet if you know what I mean I like how takes Olivia S ain't's Car uses her Car Phone calls Quentin to meet him at this Hotel or he will reveal the photos to his boss & he leaves her Car at the spot where Quentin was & her car would be ticketed & the whole fire hydrant thing was so nobody else would park in that spot so Frank could put the car back where it was it's all mind games which I love. There is different scenes in ran down apartments Frank is staying at like there's this Ex Boyfriend of Joan's threatening her Dave & Bumpo are intimidated so Frank steps up & beat him up then takes his switch blade knife hits him in the nose real hard he tells him ""You shouldn't play with knifes."" Word gets out Frank Castle is still alive he goes to The Police & asks them why they haven't got the people who killed his Family they tell him they know he's upset. I love this line where tells them ""Upset? Is that the word? I used to get upset. When I got a flat tire, when a plane was delayed. I used to get upset when The Yankees won the series. So if that's what upset means, what am I feeling now? If you know the word tell me because I don't?"" Then Frank goes after Howard S ain't's criminal activities where he takes out this money laundering operation he has these guys toss money out the window. As he leaves he's met by these 2 men who are in 'S ain't's group he has a draw with them which I liked cause it's sort of like a western in modern times & he just guns them down. Frank leaves his Tombstone on Golf Course that Howard S ain't is on & he gets in trouble with this Cuban Crime Organization he's in with cause of the loss of money so he sends Harry Heck to kill Frank Castle he goes to this Diner Frank Castle eating Breakfast & he sings this song called ""In Time"" a very memorable song. While he goes off he is chased by Harry Heck & he causes him to wreck his car he takes a Ballistic Knife I believe it's called Harry Heck is going to shoot & kill him he tells him how stupid he is for bringing a knife to a gun fight the knife shoots right into Harry Heck's neck & he's killed & Frank goes off with his Car. You have scene where some money is being brought on shore & he has placed an explosive on the boat where John is retrieving he finds the explosive & gets off the boat & sees The Punisher looking right at him. Howard send The Russian to kill Frank Castle who is played by Pro Wrestler Kevin Nash meanwhile Joan & the others invite Frank to dinner Joan tries to get close to Frank Castle she doesn't want his bad memories to kill him. He tells her he's not for her. Then you have The Russian attack Frank Castle this is a good fight cause The Russian was unstoppable he tries everything against The Russian like when he tosses grenade at him he just tosses right back at him Frank gets in this old style Bathtub to protect him from the blast. Or when he gets a revolver The Russian just takes a Hammer & smash's the barrel now I didn't care for them showing Joan & the others & there's this awful song playing they should of just cut that out. They end up in Joan's Apartment Castle grabs a pot of boiling water throws it at The Russian's face then he tackles him where they both fall off the balcony & it the fall kills The Russian. While Joan, Dave & Bumpo are tending to Frank Quentin shows up with a group of guys they hide Frank in this hidden area Dave & Bumpo won't tell him where he's at Quentin takes a pair pliers & rips off Dave's piercings he still doesn't tell him & Quentin ends up leaving but leaves a man behind to kill Frank when gets back. Frank takes a paper cutter & jams it into that guys head. He sets off for his final attack Thomas Jane has this cool voice over when he's getting ready ""I leave this as a declaration of intent, so no 1 will be confused. 1 vs pacem, para bellum. Latin Boot Camp Sergeant made us recite like a prayer. If you want peace prepare for war. 2 Frank Castle is dead. He died with his family. 3 In certain extreme situations, the law is inadequate. In order shame it's inadequacy it is necessary to act outside the law. To presue natural justice this is not vengence. Revenge is not a valid motive, it's an emotional response. No not vengence. Punishment. He has Mickey go ahead with their plan & Howard S ain't thinks his Wife is cheating on him he kills his best Friend Quentin Glass he takes his Wife & takes her & throws on some Train Tracks where she is killed by a Train. He then puts up $50,000 to help him go after Frank Castle & 100,000 for the man who kills him. Castle goes around takes the people guarding the area he takes a Bow & Arrow shoots a guy in the neck he the shoots an arrow in the side of neck of another guy which it looks cool how it it's stuck in his neck. He gets into the club he has some champagne sent up & places an explosive in the bucket it goes off & he strikes in the confusion he goes to town with an Assault Rifle takes some of these guys down he uses an assortment guns I like how he wears the skull shirt over his body armor. He has a scuffle with this 1 henchmen he takes that guys shotgun shoots him in the foot takes a knife pulls his arm behind back stabs him in the arm then you get a good bit of gore where he stabs him under the chin & the blade comes up between his teeth. He goes after a hurt John S ain't where he makes him hold on to a trip wire grenade. The Punisher goes outside after HowardS ain't he yells ""Howard S ain't! HOWARD S AIN'T!"" He turns around The Punisher shoots him he leaves him the pictures he tells him how he made him kill his Friend & his Wife & he killed both his Sons. He ties him up to to the back of a Car & sends him into a parking lot with cars rigged with explosive & Howard S ain't is killed above is a flaming skull that forms which I am sure they got from The Crow a movie that I can't wait to review for 20 years ago. Anyway before he leaves he tells Joan he's leaving he will be busy & to check the newspaper everyday & to check the obituaries. He tells her how she is right good memories can save your life. He leaves Joan & the others money he took from Howard S ain't. The the last shot is awesome with The Punisher on a bridge saying how the guilty will be punished & they will know him as The Punisher. Which a sequel would've been nice but LGF wanted to please group of fans that were fans of The Punisher Warzone comics. I'm not going into that movie & I seen that video call Punisher Dirty Laundry it's a 10 minute video made by Thomas Jane & he shows why he's perfect for the role but since Marvel has the right to make Punisher movies & Marvel is owned by Disney if we ever get another Punisher movie it will PG 13 & made for kids which The Punisher isn't for kids. Jonathon Hensleigh did a good job directing. Thomas Jane did a great job. John Travolta had his moments of bad acting but overall he did a good job. Rebecca Romjm did a good jon too. I enjoy Punisher 04 the plot was good the mind game tactics were was smart writing & I'll go ahead & say it this is an art piece. Plus the soundtrack was good songs such as ""Step Up"" by Drowning Pool & Broken by Seether & Amy Lee. If you see it on TV watch to see if you like this movie or if you find The DVD or Blu Ray cheap buy although The Blu Ray picture quality is only decent. I got more of these 20 years ago 2004 in film review I'm not finished by any stretch of the imagination.",4,2004 in film The Punisher another underrated Punisher flick 8/10,1397606400,"04 16,

836470,A2E1QTFS01GT4P,B0002IQMAM,"J. Urban ""U2fan4ever76""","[10, 12]","I am apparently one of the only real fans of the 2004 Punisher movie as it didn't do very well at the box office. I bought the original DVD and now this new Extended Cut DVD.Since everyone knows the basic plot of the movie or if they don't, they can read a synopsis of it elsewhere in this review section, I am only going to review the new aspects of this DVD released by Lionsgate.First of all the packaging is unique though flimsy at best. It is standard ""hard paper stock"" packaging as opposed to a plastic case. The Punisher skull insignia can be removed--why, I don't know. The case also opens up instead of the traditional side opening.Now to the movie. On the menu screen you have the option to watch the movie with the ""Animated Kuwait deleted scene"" or just the ""Extended Cut"" by itself--they do not mention whether or not the 5-6 minute animated scene is included in this 17 minute ""Extended Cut.""The ""Animated Kumait deleted scene"" is interesting as it appears like an animatronic graphic novel with new vocal performance by Thomas Jane and the actor who played Jimmy Weeks. It lasts for 5-6 minutes and is a shame it was never made as live action (due to budget and time).As with any movie that re-incorporated deleted footage back into the original movie, it is sometimes hard to tell if it is new footage or not. Some scenes are basically extended. The best part and what really defines the ""Extended Cut"" is the new side plot that has been inserted.BEWARE SPOILERS BELOW!The new side plot involving Frank Castle's friend from his Desert Storm team and more recently his FBI buddy (in the retirement scene) is very startling and changes the movie quite a bit and fills in some gaps. We learn now how Saint really discovered who Frank Castle was and where his family would be. (In the original cut, he is handed a dossier from his right-hand man, Glass, where we are led to believe Glass discovered it--but now we see that due to Weeks' gambling debts, he is coerced into giving Frank's identity up.) There are several other scenes of Frank and Weeks all leading up to Frank realizing Weeks betrayed him. The final scene with Weeks is a bit disturbing and really brings home the fact that Castle is dead and that The Punisher is alive and well.END OF SPOILERS!As for any other added footage, it is very hard to notice.Other special features such as the Punisher comic book gallery are nice but really, could they not have included more comic covers and maybe the entire comic book in a readable format on your television screen? As it stands, you get to flip through the ""1970's"" through ""2000's"" and see a handful of the more popular The Punisher comic book covers and trivia about the covers and the stories contained inside. (Interestingly enough, when you click on the ""1970's"" the first comic to appear is a 1975 comic, whereas the 1974 first appearance of The Punisher is the next one to be shown.)The ""Making-of featurette"" leaves a lot to be desired. The one on the original DVD (which was not included on this one) was much better. This one basically shows how the actors, writers, and director got back together to film the animated scene. Nothing more, nothing less. It might have been nice of some mention of The Punisher 2, that is in development or a longer ""Making of"" talking about the newly added footage and the original footage.Lastly, you would think that with a ""Special Edition"" DVD, that you would have all of the movie trailers and tv spots for The Punisher, right? Guess what, there are NO movie trailers or tv spots for The Punisher. All you get is one trailer after another for a bunch of horror movies--that's right--HORROR MOVIES that Lionsgate is putting out. They couldn't even tack on a trailer of the upcoming Marvel comic movie, Ghost Rider or the next Marvel movie, Spiderman 3.Overall, if you love The Punisher, purchase this, but wait till you can get it for $10. I paid $15 and I think that is too much after already owning the original. The added footage does help to make it a  better, well-rounded movie. If you don't own the original, go ahead and buy this, it is a great, dark comic movie.",3,The Punisher - Extended Cut - Review,1164672000,"11 28, 2006",2006,4145,"['am', 'apparently', 'one', 'only', 'real', 'fans', '2004', 'Punisher', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'bought', 'original', 'DVD', 'now', 'new', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'DVD.Since', 'everyone', 'basic', 'plot', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'can', 'read', 'synopsis', 'elsewhere', 'review', 'section', 'am', 'only', 'going', 'review', 'new', 'aspects', 'DVD', 'released', 'Lionsgate.First', 'packaging', 'unique', 'flimsy', 'best', 'standard', 'hard', 'paper', 'stock', 'packaging', 'opposed', 'plastic', 'case', 'Punisher', 'skull', 'insignia', 'can', 'be', 'removed', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'case', 'also', 'up', 'instead', 'traditional', 'side', 'opening.Now', 'movie', 'menu', 'screen', 'have', 'option', 'watch', 'movie', 'Animated', 'Kuwait', 'deleted', 'scene', 'just', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'do', 'not', 'mention', 'not', '5-6', 'minute', 'animated', 'scene', 'included', '17', 'minute', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'Animated', 'Kumait', 'deleted', 'scene', 'interesting', 'animatronic', 'graphic', 'novel', 'new', 'vocal', 'performance', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Jimmy', 'Weeks', '5-6', 'minutes', 'shame', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'live', 'action', 'due', 'budget', 'time', '.As', 'movie', 're-incorporated', 'deleted', 'footage', 'back', 'original', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'tell', 'new', 'footage', 'not', 'scenes', 'are', 'basically', 'extended', 'best', 'part', 'what', 'really', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'new', 'side', 'plot', 'been', 'inserted.BEWARE', 'SPOILERS', 'BELOW', 'new', 'side', 'plot', 'involving', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'friend', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'team', 'more', 'recently', 'FBI', 'buddy', 'retirement', 'scene', 'very', 'startling', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'fills', 'gaps', 'learn', 'now', 'how', 'Saint', 'really', 'discovered', 'who', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'was', 'where', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'original', 'cut', 'handed', 'dossier', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Glass', 'where', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'Glass', 'discovered', 'now', 'see', 'due', 'Weeks', 'gambling', 'debts', 'coerced', 'giving', 'Frank', 'identity', 'up', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'scenes', 'Frank', 'Weeks', 'leading', 'up', 'Frank', 'realizing', 'Weeks', 'betrayed', 'final', 'scene', 'Weeks', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'really', 'home', 'fact', 'Castle', 'dead', 'Punisher', 'alive', 'well.END', 'OF', 'SPOILERS', 'other', 'added', 'footage', 'very', 'hard', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'Punisher', 'comic', 'book', 'gallery', 'are', 'nice', 'really', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'comic', 'covers', 'maybe', 'entire', 'comic', 'book', 'readable', 'format', 'television', 'screen', 'get', 'flip', '1970', '2000', 'see', 'handful', 'more', 'popular', 'Punisher', 'comic', 'book', 'covers', 'trivia', 'covers', 'stories', 'contained', 'inside', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'when', 'click', '1970', 'first', 'comic', 'appear', '1975', 'comic', '1974', 'first', 'appearance', 'Punisher', 'next', 'one', 'be', 'shown', 'Making-of', 'featurette', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'one', 'original', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'one', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'basically', 'how', 'actors', 'writers', 'director', 'got', 'back', 'together', 'film', 'animated', 'scene', 'Nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'mention', 'Punisher', '2', 'development', 'longer', 'Making', 'talking', 'newly', 'added', 'footage', 'original', 'footage.Lastly', 'would', 'think', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'movie', 'trailers', 'tv', 'spots', 'Punisher', 'right', 'Guess', 'what', 'are', 'NO', 'movie', 'trailers', 'tv', 'spots', 'Punisher', 'All', 'get', 'one', 'trailer', 'bunch', 'horror', 'movies', 'right', 'HORROR', 'MOVIES', 'Lionsgate', 'putting', 'out', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'tack', 'trailer', 'upcoming', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'movie', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'next', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'Spiderman', '3.Overall', 'love', 'Punisher', 'purchase', 'wait', 'can', 'get', '10', 'paid', '15', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'already', 'owning', 'original', 'added', 'footage', 'help', 'make', 'better', 'well-rounded', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'original', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'great', 'dark', 'comic', 'movie']",N/A
836471,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0002IQMAM,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[4, 5]","When comic book movies began making their comeback during the last few years, most of the movies were based on very well known characters from Marvel and DC Comics.  After a string of hits, Marvel decided to try their hand at adapting a character that isn't as well known, and in fact had already been adapted miserably in the early 90's, the character is The Punisher.The story for ""The Punisher"" begins when undercover agent Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is working on a drug sting, but the sting doesn't go as planned and a few of the criminals die in the process.  This wouldn't be that big of a deal, except for one of the criminals is the son of Howard Saint (John Travolta), the biggest crime boss in Miami.  With the death of his son, Howard, places a hit on Frank Castle and his entire family.  Saint's thugs do as they're told, and assault Frank and his family during a vacation.  After being left for dead, Frank comes to, only to discover that his entire family has been murdered, and that he's badly wounded.  Once on the mend, Frank begins to plot his revenge and deliver his own brand of punishment for Howard Saint and his criminal empire.This movie was quite impressive for a comic book adaptation.  I thought it captured the character of Frank Castle really well.  Easily lets the viewer forget about the dismal ""The Punisher"" movie featuring Dolph Lungdren in the title role from 1992.  This movie featuring a strong cast, headed by Thomas Jane who does an excellent job capturing the devastation/depression of his family's murder, and channelling those emotions into vengeance.  John Travolta does a very good job playing the villain as usual, and you can tell he's enjoying this role.  The rest of the cast deliver strong supporting roles especially Rebecca Romijn and Ben Foster who bring Frank's eccentric new neighbors to life.The setups for the punishments are done very nicely, Frank is not just picking them off simply by shooting them as one might expect, rather Castle goes through an elaborate setup to take his revenge on the man who murdered his family, Howard Saint.  Nice adaptation of the characters Mr. Bumpo, Spacker Dave, and Joan from the Garth Ennis comics.  The violence is not gratuitous or over the top in the least, all very well done.  The only true complaints I have are very minor, the biggest being that nothing occurs in New York which is where Marvel's characters generally reside, The Punisher among them.  Also, they changed Frank Castle from being a Vietnam Vet into an undercover agent, which is fine I understand artistic license plus you want a young Frank Castle so that one's fine.Overall very well done despite what the critics say about it.  Very few problems, great action scenes, good acting.  Highly recommend if you're in the mood for a good action movie with a plot or just a comic book fan looking for a good adaptation.""The Punisher"" is rated R for violence and language.",5,Crime Must Be Punished...,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,2935,"['When', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'began', 'making', 'comeback', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'most', 'movies', 'were', 'based', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'characters', 'Marvel', 'DC', 'Comics', 'string', 'hits', 'Marvel', 'decided', 'try', 'hand', 'adapting', 'character', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'known', 'fact', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'adapted', 'miserably', 'early', '90', 'character', 'Punisher.The', 'story', 'Punisher', 'when', 'undercover', 'agent', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'working', 'drug', 'sting', 'sting', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'few', 'criminals', 'die', 'process', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'one', 'criminals', 'son', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'John', 'Travolta', 'biggest', 'crime', 'boss', 'Miami', 'death', 'son', 'Howard', 'hit', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'entire', 'family', 'Saint', 'thugs', 'do', ""'re"", 'told', 'assault', 'Frank', 'family', 'vacation', 'being', 'left', 'dead', 'Frank', 'only', 'discover', 'entire', 'family', 'been', 'murdered', 'badly', 'wounded', 'Once', 'mend', 'Frank', 'plot', 'revenge', 'deliver', 'own', 'brand', 'punishment', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'criminal', 'empire.This', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'impressive', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'thought', 'captured', 'character', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'really', 'well', 'Easily', 'viewer', 'forget', 'dismal', 'Punisher', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Dolph', 'Lungdren', 'title', 'role', '1992', 'movie', 'featuring', 'strong', 'cast', 'headed', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'who', 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'devastation/depression', 'family', 'murder', 'channelling', 'emotions', 'vengeance', 'John', 'Travolta', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'villain', 'usual', 'can', 'tell', 'enjoying', 'role', 'rest', 'cast', 'deliver', 'strong', 'supporting', 'roles', 'especially', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'who', 'bring', 'Frank', 'eccentric', 'new', 'neighbors', 'life.The', 'setups', 'punishments', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'nicely', 'Frank', 'not', 'just', 'picking', 'off', 'simply', 'shooting', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'rather', 'Castle', 'elaborate', 'setup', 'take', 'revenge', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'family', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'Nice', 'adaptation', 'characters', 'Mr.', 'Bumpo', 'Spacker', 'Dave', 'Joan', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'comics', 'violence', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'top', 'least', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'only', 'true', 'complaints', 'have', 'are', 'very', 'minor', 'biggest', 'being', 'nothing', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'Marvel', 'characters', 'generally', 'reside', 'Punisher', 'Also', 'changed', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'being', 'Vietnam', 'Vet', 'undercover', 'agent', 'fine', 'understand', 'artistic', 'license', 'want', 'young', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'one', 'fine.Overall', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'what', 'critics', 'say', 'Very', 'few', 'problems', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'good', 'acting', 'Highly', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'mood', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'plot', 'just', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'looking', 'good', 'adaptation', 'Punisher', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language']",N/A

836476,A1ZKAHFYCJRGQM,B0002IQMAM,Kenneth V. Cockrel,"[8, 9]","There's amazing sequence of scenes in ""The Punisher: In the Beginning,""  a Marvel graphic novel collecting a recent series of comics featuring the urban vigilante.It begins with Frank Castle AKA The Punisher storming into the birthday party of an aging Mafia Don.  Castle promptly shoots the Don in the head before walking calmly out the door.  After this a collection of shocked goombahs follows him onto the front lawn where Castle proceeds to mow them down with an M-60 machine gun.The final body count: 47 people dead.  Now here's the really incredible thing: This all happens only A FEW PAGES INTO THE BOOK!  From here the storyline gets even more over the top.The problem with ""The Punisher"" movie is that THAT Frank Castle never shows up.  Anyone who buys the movie hoping  to see some glimmer of the relentless, unstoppable badass of the current Marvel comic will be sorely dissappointed.I don't have a problem with the casting of the Thomas Jane.  I've always thought he was a matinee idol in the making, a star just waiting for the right movie that allows the whole world to see that.Granted he's at least 20 years younger than his comic book counterpart but the de-aging makes sense given realities of Hollywood film-making and audience expectations.I don't even have a problem with the liberties taken with character's origin.  Comic book Vietnam Vet Frank Castle has been transformed into movie ex-FBI agent Frank Castle.Furthermore, whereas in the comic, Castle's wife and two children were killed in the crossfire of a mob battle, the movie has his entire extended family(wife, son, Mom, Dad, cousins etc., etc.)  being slaughtered.What I have a problem with is the fact ""The Punisher""  is one of the most toothless R-rated movies ever made.  I'm not a gorehound but it seems to me that if you're going to do a movie about a ruthless, vigilante like the Punisher, you've got to stay true to the character and go all the way.While the movie does incorporate characters created by current Punisher scribe Garth Ennis it has none of the razor sharp wit and intelligence that makes the comics such a fun read.  Bottom line:  This is Punisher-Lite.Matters aren't helped by the weak script which pits John Travolta, as money launderer Howard Saint against Jane's Castle.  Travolta is a brilliant actor, yes, but even the greatest actor can be hard pressed to overcome a bad script.  Saint just never comes to life as a villain.Adding insult to injury, The Punisher is moved from his comic book environs of New York City to Tampa, Florida!  Taking such dark, gritty, urban character and smacking him in a sunny tropical playground makes no sense and serves the story poorly.  It's kinda like transplanting Batman to Anaheim.It seems like Marvel's movies have fallen into an alternating hit or miss pattern.  For every X Men or Spiderman or Blade(great movies all) there's a Daredevil and now Punisher in the miss column.Let's hope the next Marvel movie offering does a better job of honoring its source material than this.",2,Punisher Lite,1100822400,"11 19, 2004",2004,3030,"['amazing', 'sequence', 'scenes', 'Punisher', 'Beginning', 'Marvel', 'graphic', 'novel', 'collecting', 'recent', 'series', 'comics', 'featuring', 'urban', 'vigilante.It', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'AKA', 'Punisher', 'storming', 'birthday', 'party', 'aging', 'Mafia', 'Don', 'Castle', 'promptly', 'Don', 'head', 'walking', 'calmly', 'door', 'collection', 'shocked', 'goombahs', 'front', 'lawn', 'where', 'Castle', 'mow', 'down', 'M-60', 'machine', 'gun.The', 'final', 'body', 'count', '47', 'people', 'dead', 'Now', 'here', 'really', 'incredible', 'thing', 'only', 'A', 'FEW', 'PAGES', 'INTO', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'here', 'storyline', 'even', 'more', 'top.The', 'problem', 'Punisher', 'movie', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'never', 'up', 'Anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'hoping', 'see', 'glimmer', 'relentless', 'unstoppable', 'badass', 'current', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'dissappointed.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'casting', 'Thomas', 'Jane', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'matinee', 'idol', 'making', 'star', 'just', 'waiting', 'right', 'movie', 'whole', 'world', 'see', 'that.Granted', 'least', '20', 'years', 'younger', 'comic', 'book', 'counterpart', 'de-aging', 'sense', 'given', 'realities', 'Hollywood', 'film-making', 'audience', 'expectations.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'problem', 'liberties', 'taken', 'character', 'origin', 'Comic', 'book', 'Vietnam', 'Vet', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'been', 'transformed', 'movie', 'ex-FBI', 'agent', 'Frank', 'Castle.Furthermore', 'whereas', 'comic', 'Castle', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'were', 'killed', 'crossfire', 'mob', 'battle', 'movie', 'entire', 'extended', 'family', 'wife', 'son', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'etc.', 'etc', 'being', 'slaughtered.What', 'have', 'problem', 'fact', 'Punisher', 'one', 'most', 'toothless', 'R-rated', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', ""'m"", 'not', 'gorehound', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'movie', 'ruthless', 'vigilante', 'Punisher', ""'ve"", 'got', 'stay', 'true', 'character', 'go', 'way.While', 'movie', 'incorporate', 'characters', 'created', 'current', 'Punisher', 'scribe', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'none', 'razor', 'sharp', 'wit', 'intelligence', 'comics', 'such', 'fun', 'read', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Punisher-Lite.Matters', 'are', ""n't"", 'helped', 'weak', 'script', 'John', 'Travolta', 'money', 'launderer', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'Jane', 'Castle', 'Travolta', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'yes', 'even', 'greatest', 'actor', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'overcome', 'bad', 'script', 'Saint', 'just', 'never', 'life', 'villain.Adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'Punisher', 'moved', 'comic', 'book', 'environs', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Tampa', 'Florida', 'Taking', 'such', 'dark', 'gritty', 'urban', 'character', 'smacking', 'sunny', 'tropical', 'playground', 'sense', 'story', 'poorly', 'kinda', 'transplanting', 'Batman', 'Anaheim.It', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'have', 'fallen', 'alternating', 'hit', 'miss', 'pattern', 'X', 'Men', 'Spiderman', 'Blade', 'great', 'movies', 'Daredevil', 'now', 'Punisher', 'miss', 'column.Let', 'hope', 'next', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'offering', 'better', 'job', 'honoring', 'source', 'material']",N/A

836478,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0002IQMAM,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[6, 7]","It confuses me at how this film did so poorly when compared to other comic book flicks.  It has plenty of great action for the action buffs, the story is excellent, even though many claim that it veers wide of the original story, and the acting is great, excepting John Travolta, whose performance was less than expected.I loved comics as a kid, and I read a few as I entered college, but I've never read any ""Punisher"" comics unless he happened to pop up in someone else's story.  This movie, however, makes this character much more interesting than I thought before.  Many comic fans whine about how this movie altered their beloved Frank Castle, but I think this film does a pretty good job of developing the character, regardless of any liberties taken.  Keep in mind that the producers are hoping to reach beyond the typical ""Punisher"" fanbase, and alterations were necessary.  Basically, Castle is portrayed as a vengeful soul, who seeks vigilante justice when his whole family is murdered due to the fact that he kills off a mobster's baby boy.  He lives in a rundown apartment complex, becomes an alcoholic, and has neighbors that would freak out folks in the suburbs.  Simply put, his world is in shambles and he wants retribution.  I'm not sure how far off this character development is, but it fits the film just fine.Thomas(or Tom) Jane plays Frank Castle/Punisher is this movie.  I think he does a fantastic job.  I don't see this character as a victim.  To me, he is portrayed as a man who has lost everything and seeks to make his pain go away.  A victim would just hide in the corner, not go after his enemies, guns ablazing.  Others haved said that Castle sulks too much in this movie.  Give the guy a break, his whole family has been wiped out!  John Travolta plays Howard Saint.  He's the main baddie that Castle is hoping to make life a living hell for.  Travolta's performance seems forced at times, but once he gets into his ""kill"" mode, he does a good job.  The rest of the cast does a superb job setting up the story.  Rebecca Romijn provides eye-candy and a good friend to Castle.  Ben Foster does a great job as a pierced-to-the-nines geek who stands up for the Punisher.  Pro-wrestler Kevin Nash has a speechless role as ""the Russian"" who pounds our hero into a pulp.  I almost didn't recognize him.The action is brilliant and, once underway, doesn't stop.  Many of the deaths in this film are rather original.  Others are just brutal to watch(especially when a certain person catches a train).  The R-rating is well deserved.  Keep the little comic fans far away from this one.I've seen pretty much all of the comic adaptations that have been cranked out since the goofy Adam West versions of ""Batman.""  Compared to these other films, I'd rank this particular one just above ""Hellboy"" and ""Blade"" due to the acting and story quality.  It has plenty of fight sequences, guns, and explosives to quench even the most sadistic thirst.  The story is plotted out very well and the acting is better than most of the other comic-to-screen adaptations.  Also, in case you're wondering, Dolph Lundgren's ""Punisher"" doesn't hold a candle to this one.Comic purists aside, anyone who loves action flicks with a really good plot should love this film.  It isn't brainless, though some of that is thrown in thanks to ""the Russian.""  It's a very smart film that is much better than similar flicks such as ""Daredevil,"" which I enjoyed, and ten times as good as the snoozer known as ""Hulk.""  Liberties might have been taken with the characters, but they make for an interesting story.This film is highly underrated.  Don't turn this one down just because it doesn't follow the comic page-by-page.

Vin Diesel's 'A Man Apart' got bombed, but it really shouldn't have. Conceptually it was pretty good.What I liked about the Vin Diesel role was less quips. What I disliked about the Tom Jane role was the presence of more humor than a man who has had his entire bloodline erradicated is entitled to have. It seems pandering, a directorial attempt to appeal to all possible emotional demographic groups. Unnecessary.Jane does look a little like Christopher Lambert but I think that's in the eyes. The man is well buffed.All in all, good acting; good photography. I hope we see more of Frank Castle and Tom Jane. 4 stars.

836487,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002IQMAM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","I am not sure how ambivalent I am about this 2004 version of ""The Punisher,"" but I found myself repeatedly thinking that the movie was taking two steps backwards for every step forward, so that by the end we were not ahead of the game. The original origin of the Punisher was that Frank Castle was out on a picnic with his family when they stumbled upon a mob hit and were gunned down. Frank survived, became the Punisher, and dedicated his life to making sure that those who avoid justice through the imperfections of the American legal system were made to pay for their crimes. This is a tradition that goes back to Batman and the Shadow, with the key difference that the Punisher has a lot of heavy weaponry. There are lots of comic book superheroes who have to deal with the onerous of being considered a vigilante, but the Punisher embraced the idea without ever worrying about being considered a hero.This time around Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) has much more of a hand in his tragic fate. He is an F.B.I. agent and the Fates conspire than on his last undercover job he kills one of the sons of gangster Howard Saint (John Travolta). Frank heads off to retirement and a family reunion in Puerto Rico while Saint orders his thugs to kill him. But then his wife (Laura Harring) ups the antes and tells them to kill his entire family. So that is what happens, as everyone of his relatives is gunned down in a prolonged massacre before his wife and son are dispatched in a poor imitation of the harrowing scene where the same thing happens to Mel Gibson in ""Mad Max."" Frank is shot point blank in the chest and just about set on fire, but none of this matters because he is going to come back from the ""dead"" and kill all of these people. That is what this movie is about.But the idea that you have this one guy who everybody thinks is dead come back and wipe out an entire criminal organization starts losing momentum when Frank blows the surprise element of being dead pretty quick. Meanwhile, not once but twice a single person just about takes him out and ends the movie before the final act. I always thought the Punisher's weak spot was that he was psychotic, not that he was relatively easy to surprise or beat up. He does come up with a nice little plan to stick it to Saint, but it is the sort of thing where you the realization of what has happened to sink into the guy before you put a couple of bullet holes in him and not afterwards. I also think that if you spend all your spare time turning a car into an armored tank that it should be good for more than one scene.The character who actually impressed me the most, surprisingly enough, was Spacker Dave (Ben Foster). He has one of the apartments in the dilapidated building Castle moves into to plan his punishment. Dave sticks his nose into the business of an abusive boyfriend pounding on the door of the lovely Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) and is rescued by Castle, something nobody has ever done. So when Saint's right-hand man Quentin Glass (Will Patton) shows up looking for Castle and tortures Dave, using his various piercings against him, the guy does not break down and rat out Frank. It was an unexpected moment and has to do with the idea of Castle's new family (everybody in the building knows who Frank is and what he is doing), but still it had more gravity than anything else in the film.Jane worked himself in an appropriate state of buffness for this role, but is constrained by the script to mostly giving intense stares and making laconic comments in the Clint Eastwood tradition, while Travolta actually shows some restraint in mouthing his character's over the top lines. I missed the Dolph Lundgren in the 1989 film version adapted from the Marvel comics character, but my life has been full none the less and I suppose I should go check it out and see which of these two versions comes closest to capturing the essence of the comic book I remember, because based on what I saw in this film the title is still up for grabs.",3,"It depends on whether you think this is the ""real"" Punisher",1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,4012,"['am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'ambivalent', 'am', '2004', 'version', 'Punisher', 'found', 'repeatedly', 'thinking', 'movie', 'was', 'taking', 'two', 'steps', 'backwards', 'step', 'forward', 'end', 'were', 'not', 'ahead', 'game', 'original', 'origin', 'Punisher', 'was', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'was', 'out', 'picnic', 'family', 'when', 'stumbled', 'mob', 'hit', 'were', 'gunned', 'down', 'Frank', 'survived', 'became', 'Punisher', 'dedicated', 'life', 'making', 'sure', 'who', 'avoid', 'justice', 'imperfections', 'American', 'legal', 'system', 'were', 'made', 'pay', 'crimes', 'tradition', 'back', 'Batman', 'Shadow', 'key', 'difference', 'Punisher', 'lot', 'heavy', 'weaponry', 'are', 'lots', 'comic', 'book', 'superheroes', 'who', 'have', 'deal', 'onerous', 'being', 'considered', 'vigilante', 'Punisher', 'embraced', 'idea', 'ever', 'worrying', 'being', 'considered', 'hero.This', 'time', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'much', 'more', 'hand', 'tragic', 'fate', 'F.B.I', 'agent', 'Fates', 'conspire', 'last', 'undercover', 'job', 'one', 'sons', 'gangster', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Frank', 'retirement', 'family', 'reunion', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'Saint', 'orders', 'thugs', 'kill', 'then', 'wife', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'ups', 'antes', 'kill', 'entire', 'family', 'what', 'everyone', 'relatives', 'gunned', 'down', 'prolonged', 'massacre', 'wife', 'son', 'are', 'dispatched', 'poor', 'imitation', 'harrowing', 'scene', 'where', 'same', 'thing', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Mad', 'Max', 'Frank', 'shot', 'point', 'blank', 'chest', 'just', 'about', 'set', 'fire', 'none', 'matters', 'going', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'kill', 'people', 'what', 'movie', 'idea', 'have', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'everybody', 'dead', 'come', 'back', 'out', 'entire', 'criminal', 'organization', 'losing', 'momentum', 'when', 'Frank', 'surprise', 'element', 'being', 'dead', 'pretty', 'quick', 'Meanwhile', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'single', 'person', 'just', 'out', 'movie', 'final', 'act', 'always', 'thought', 'Punisher', 'weak', 'spot', 'was', 'was', 'psychotic', 'not', 'was', 'relatively', 'easy', 'surprise', 'beat', 'up', 'come', 'up', 'nice', 'little', 'plan', 'stick', 'Saint', 'sort', 'thing', 'where', 'realization', 'what', 'happened', 'sink', 'guy', 'put', 'couple', 'bullet', 'holes', 'not', 'afterwards', 'also', 'think', 'spend', 'spare', 'time', 'turning', 'car', 'armored', 'tank', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'more', 'one', 'scene.The', 'character', 'who', 'actually', 'impressed', 'most', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'was', 'Spacker', 'Dave', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'one', 'apartments', 'dilapidated', 'building', 'Castle', 'plan', 'punishment', 'Dave', 'sticks', 'nose', 'business', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'pounding', 'door', 'lovely', 'Joan', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'rescued', 'Castle', 'something', 'nobody', 'ever', 'done', 'So', 'when', 'Saint', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Quentin', 'Glass', 'Will', 'Patton', 'up', 'looking', 'Castle', 'tortures', 'Dave', 'using', 'various', 'piercings', 'guy', 'not', 'break', 'down', 'rat', 'out', 'Frank', 'was', 'unexpected', 'moment', 'do', 'idea', 'Castle', 'new', 'family', 'everybody', 'building', 'knows', 'who', 'Frank', 'what', 'doing', 'still', 'had', 'more', 'gravity', 'anything', 'else', 'film.Jane', 'worked', 'appropriate', 'state', 'buffness', 'role', 'constrained', 'script', 'mostly', 'giving', 'intense', 'stares', 'making', 'laconic', 'comments', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'tradition', 'Travolta', 'actually', 'restraint', 'mouthing', 'character', 'top', 'lines', 'missed', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', '1989', 'film', 'version', 'adapted', 'Marvel', 'comics', 'character', 'life', 'been', 'full', 'none', 'less', 'suppose', 'should', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'see', 'two', 'versions', 'closest', 'capturing', 'essence', 'comic', 'book', 'remember', 'based', 'what', 'saw', 'film', 'title', 'still', 'up', 'grabs']",N/A

836501,A3K01TMQNC8EVV,B0002IQMAM,"Mark Anderson ""Andertoons""","[3, 6]","If movies were meat, ""The Punisher"" would be beefy jerky - cheap, tasteless, and cut and dried.Thomas Jane stars in this Marvel comic-to-movie and bulked up sufficiently for the part that I thought the character should have been renamed TorsoMan. For a character whose costume is basically a t-shirt, he spends an inordinately large portion of the film with his shirt off. Considering the audience is almost entirely young males, and mostly teens at that, who exactly is this aimed at?Jane's character, Frank Castle, is an undercover cop of some sort and kills the son of crime boss Howard Saint, played tepidly by John Travolta. Saint in turn executes Castle's entire family tree, and, although being shot directly in the chest at close range, Castle survives thanks to his witch doctor (no, really!) and comes back for revenge wearing the black skull t-shirt his son gave to him in a ""so cheesy I thought I was in Wisconsin"" piece of foreshadowing.There is, of course, the requisite ragtag band of 'losers' that accept Castle as one of their own. One is some sort of drug addict who's into piercings, another is your generic fat guy, and then there's the sexy love interest, supermodel Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, who lives down the hall.I'd read a review on Amazon that suggested Travolta's performance was 'over the top.' Please! Over the top would've been welcome (unless of course we're talking about the 1987 arm-wrestling vehicle for Sylvester Stallone). Howard Saint is evidently supposed to be a coolly detached criminal who kills both employees and family at the drop of a hat with steely resolve, but Travolta just ends up looking bored. I'm with ya there Johnny boy!(The music major in me would also like to note that I noticed an eerie similarity to the Travolta character's musical theme, and that of Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers movies. Listen closely and you'll know I'm right.)The movie is entirely predictable. Here's an example of the trite dialogue that makes me want to write director Jonathan Hensleigh and ask for my $3.69 back:Punisher to leggy supermodel - ""Read your newspaper every day and you'll understand.""Leggy supermodel - ""Which section?""(Can you hear it coming?)Punisher - ""The obituaries.""The whole movie is like that! It's like it was penned by some teenage boys in detention who were forced into some sort of group creative writing assignment.But here's the thing that bothered me the most - for a movie about a deranged revenge seeker who's stockpiling guns like Charlton Heston is coming to dinner, the ""hero enters with guns blazing"" moment doesn't come until 1:43:42 into the movie. And it's only a two-hour movie!No no, our hero brings down the bad guy by convincing him that his wife is sleeping with his right hand man. Travolta then kills both himself while laying on puns usually reserved for the muscle-bound hero. Of course Castle gets everyone else in the end and saves his 21 car-bomb salute for Travolta.Listen, if you want to see a good revenge flick, rent ""Kill Bill"". Both volumes! But if you want to see angry guys in dark rooms lit only by the neon filtered through the fan in their window, people being thrown to their deaths through rickety railings (honestly, note to bad guys in movies - stay away from the railings!), and thunder and lightning punctuating ""dramatic"" turns of phrase, even when it's not raining, then ""The Punisher"" is the movie for you!",2,"If movies were meat, ""The Punisher"" would be beefy jerky!",1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,3411,"['movies', 'were', 'meat', 'Punisher', 'would', 'be', 'beefy', 'jerky', 'cheap', 'tasteless', 'cut', 'dried.Thomas', 'Jane', 'stars', 'Marvel', 'comic-to-movie', 'bulked', 'up', 'sufficiently', 'part', 'thought', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'renamed', 'TorsoMan', 'character', 'costume', 'basically', 't-shirt', 'inordinately', 'large', 'portion', 'film', 'shirt', 'off', 'Considering', 'audience', 'almost', 'entirely', 'young', 'males', 'mostly', 'teens', 'who', 'exactly', 'aimed', 'Jane', 'character', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'undercover', 'cop', 'sort', 'son', 'crime', 'boss', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'played', 'tepidly', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Saint', 'turn', 'Castle', 'entire', 'family', 'tree', 'being', 'shot', 'directly', 'chest', 'close', 'range', 'Castle', 'thanks', 'witch', 'doctor', 'really', 'back', 'revenge', 'wearing', 'black', 'skull', 't-shirt', 'son', 'gave', 'so', 'cheesy', 'thought', 'was', 'Wisconsin', 'piece', 'foreshadowing.There', 'course', 'requisite', 'ragtag', 'band', ""'losers"", 'accept', 'Castle', 'one', 'own', 'One', 'sort', 'drug', 'addict', 'who', 'piercings', 'generic', 'fat', 'guy', 'then', 'sexy', 'love', 'interest', 'supermodel', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'who', 'down', 'hall.I', ""'d"", 'read', 'review', 'Amazon', 'suggested', 'Travolta', 'performance', 'was', 'top', 'Please', 'top', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'welcome', 'course', ""'re"", 'talking', '1987', 'arm-wrestling', 'vehicle', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'evidently', 'supposed', 'be', 'coolly', 'detached', 'criminal', 'who', 'employees', 'family', 'drop', 'hat', 'steely', 'resolve', 'Travolta', 'just', 'up', 'looking', 'bored', ""'m"", 'ya', 'Johnny', 'boy', 'music', 'major', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'note', 'noticed', 'eerie', 'similarity', 'Travolta', 'character', 'musical', 'theme', 'Dr', 'Evil', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'movies', 'Listen', 'closely', ""'ll"", 'know', ""'m"", 'right', 'movie', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'Here', 'example', 'trite', 'dialogue', 'want', 'write', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Hensleigh', 'ask', '3.69', 'back', 'Punisher', 'leggy', 'supermodel', 'Read', 'newspaper', 'day', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'Leggy', 'supermodel', 'Which', 'section', 'Can', 'hear', 'coming', 'Punisher', 'obituaries', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'penned', 'teenage', 'boys', 'detention', 'who', 'were', 'forced', 'sort', 'group', 'creative', 'writing', 'assignment.But', 'here', 'thing', 'bothered', 'most', 'movie', 'deranged', 'revenge', 'seeker', 'who', 'stockpiling', 'guns', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'coming', 'dinner', 'hero', 'enters', 'guns', 'blazing', 'moment', ""n't"", 'come', '1:43:42', 'movie', 'only', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'hero', 'down', 'bad', 'guy', 'convincing', 'wife', 'sleeping', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Travolta', 'then', 'laying', 'puns', 'usually', 'reserved', 'muscle-bound', 'hero', 'course', 'Castle', 'everyone', 'else', 'end', '21', 'car-bomb', 'salute', 'Travolta.Listen', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'revenge', 'flick', 'rent', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'volumes', 'want', 'see', 'angry', 'guys', 'dark', 'rooms', 'lit', 'only', 'neon', 'filtered', 'fan', 'window', 'people', 'being', 'thrown', 'deaths', 'rickety', 'railings', 'honestly', 'note', 'bad', 'guys', 'movies', 'stay', 'away', 'railings', 'thunder', 'lightning', 'punctuating', 'dramatic', 'turns', 'phrase', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'raining', 'then', 'Punisher', 'movie']",N/A

836504,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0002IQMAM,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","One of the most violent characters seen in comics came to life in 1989 and was blown off of the screen. The reasons were obvious. It was a film made for comic fans that completely left out everything that had made the character so popular with those same comic fans. The film quickly became the movie comic fans referred to when they discussed movies that didn't come close to doing their source justice.All that is forgiven with the release of the new version. Bypassing just a tad of the source material this time, we are given the story of Frank Castle (Thomas Jane), ex Special Forces soldier and undercover FBI agent who has just retired. His last assignment led to the death of a criminal purchasing illegal guns. The problem is that this same criminal's father, Howard Saint (John Travolta), is a powerful money launderer for a Cuban cartel. And he wants revenge for the death of his youngest son.At a family reunion in Puerto Rico, Castle's entire family is murdered by Saint's men. Everyone from his father and mother to his wife and child. Castle is also left for dead, shot three times. But with the help of a friend, he survives with one thing on his mind. Revenge.Moving to Tampa where Saint is centered, Castle begins disturbing Saint's operations. Everything from stealing the money he was to launder to having Saint's men dump it from the high rise where they are counting it. Each act angers Saint more until he finally sends out for assistance from professionals. Each of these is greeted with Castle's ultra violent and passion filled hatred. All that is until Frank finds his way to Saint himself.Along the way Castle makes a few friends of the neighbors in his low level apartment: a cooking expert (John Pinnette), a computer geek (Ben Foster) and a lovely waitress with boyfriend problems (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). These become his surrogate family.The movie sets up what could become a series not only by giving us the background story of Frank Castle, The Punisher, but by showing a human side to him as well. In the comic's early days, the character was little less than an assassin (thinking back to his original appearance in Spider Man). But the grief that led to his decision to take on organized crime, the pain he endured at the loss of his family, all are given as much attention here as the non-stop action and violence.While at first many were concerned with the selection of Jane to portray this sacred comic character, he turns in a great performance and the appearance as well. The comics offered a dark haired, dark complected, tall, foreboding, stern faced killer. Bigger and darker actors were thought to be better for the part, since Jane had been seen as blonde in most everything previous. But they not only make him look the part, he absorbs it as well.Travolta is here but it feels like he has far too little screen time. What he does when on screen is fantastic, offering us a maniacal money mover with power to spare and anger as huge.The movie may not be one that younger viewers can handle, but fans of the comic and those not yet exposed will love it. Forget the comic and you still have a great movie that delivers everything that trailer led us to believe we would see. Watching THE PUNISHER is no punishment. It just leaves you waiting to see the next installment.",4,NOT A PUNISHMENT TO WATCH,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,3317,"['One', 'most', 'violent', 'characters', 'seen', 'comics', 'came', 'life', '1989', 'was', 'blown', 'off', 'screen', 'reasons', 'were', 'obvious', 'was', 'film', 'made', 'comic', 'fans', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'everything', 'had', 'made', 'character', 'so', 'popular', 'same', 'comic', 'fans', 'film', 'quickly', 'became', 'movie', 'comic', 'fans', 'referred', 'when', 'discussed', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'doing', 'source', 'justice.All', 'forgiven', 'release', 'new', 'version', 'Bypassing', 'just', 'tad', 'source', 'material', 'time', 'are', 'given', 'story', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'ex', 'Special', 'Forces', 'soldier', 'undercover', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'just', 'retired', 'last', 'assignment', 'led', 'death', 'criminal', 'purchasing', 'illegal', 'guns', 'problem', 'same', 'criminal', 'father', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'John', 'Travolta', 'powerful', 'money', 'launderer', 'Cuban', 'cartel', 'revenge', 'death', 'youngest', 'son.At', 'family', 'reunion', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'Castle', 'entire', 'family', 'murdered', 'Saint', 'men', 'Everyone', 'father', 'mother', 'wife', 'child', 'Castle', 'also', 'left', 'dead', 'shot', 'three', 'times', 'help', 'friend', 'one', 'thing', 'mind', 'Revenge.Moving', 'Tampa', 'where', 'Saint', 'centered', 'Castle', 'disturbing', 'Saint', 'operations', 'Everything', 'stealing', 'money', 'was', 'launder', 'having', 'Saint', 'men', 'dump', 'high', 'rise', 'where', 'are', 'counting', 'act', 'angers', 'Saint', 'more', 'finally', 'out', 'assistance', 'professionals', 'greeted', 'Castle', 'ultra', 'violent', 'passion', 'filled', 'hatred', 'Frank', 'way', 'Saint', 'himself.Along', 'way', 'Castle', 'few', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'low', 'level', 'apartment', 'cooking', 'expert', 'John', 'Pinnette', 'computer', 'geek', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'lovely', 'waitress', 'boyfriend', 'problems', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'become', 'surrogate', 'family.The', 'movie', 'up', 'what', 'could', 'become', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'giving', 'background', 'story', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Punisher', 'showing', 'human', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'comic', 'early', 'days', 'character', 'was', 'little', 'less', 'assassin', 'thinking', 'back', 'original', 'appearance', 'Spider', 'Man', 'grief', 'led', 'decision', 'take', 'organized', 'crime', 'pain', 'endured', 'loss', 'family', 'are', 'given', 'much', 'attention', 'here', 'non-stop', 'action', 'violence.While', 'first', 'many', 'were', 'concerned', 'selection', 'Jane', 'portray', 'sacred', 'comic', 'character', 'great', 'performance', 'appearance', 'as', 'well', 'comics', 'offered', 'dark', 'haired', 'dark', 'complected', 'tall', 'foreboding', 'stern', 'faced', 'killer', 'Bigger', 'darker', 'actors', 'were', 'thought', 'be', 'better', 'part', 'Jane', 'had', 'been', 'seen', 'blonde', 'most', 'everything', 'previous', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'look', 'part', 'well.Travolta', 'here', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'What', 'when', 'screen', 'fantastic', 'offering', 'maniacal', 'money', 'mover', 'power', 'spare', 'anger', 'huge.The', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'younger', 'viewers', 'can', 'handle', 'fans', 'comic', 'not', 'yet', 'exposed', 'will', 'love', 'Forget', 'comic', 'still', 'have', 'great', 'movie', 'delivers', 'everything', 'trailer', 'led', 'believe', 'would', 'see', 'Watching', 'PUNISHER', 'punishment', 'just', 'waiting', 'see', 'next', 'installment']",N/A

Unfortunately, in Castle's last mission the son of crime boss Howard Saint (John Travolta) is accidently killed.  Saint sends his men out to kill Castle and his family were they are on a family vacation.  But Castle survives and seeks revenge on crime boss and his family for the death of his.Basically, the plot of the movie follows the storyline of the Marvel comic that it was adapted from: after the deaths of his family, Castle becomes a vindictive vigilante.  The Punisher was always meant to be the kind of hero who followed his own rules, including having an arsenal of guns and killing the bad guys instead of just sending them to jail.  The movie is faithful in this aspect; The Punisher is gritty and violent and obvisouly intended only for Marvel's adult fans.  In terms of Marvel movies, it is closest in comparison to the Blade movies and carries a similar R rating.The acting in this movie wasn't bad.  Jane actually makes a pretty good Punisher and it is impresive that he did a number of this own stunts.  Travolta is decent as Howard Saint and I didn't really have any big qualms about his role.  The only characters that I felt didn't really belong in the movie were the three ""misfit"" tenents that live in Castle's squalor apartment.  These characters were meant for ""comic relief,"" but only detracted from the serious tone of the movie.  Also, it was hard to believe that someone who looks like Rebecca Romijn would be in such a state of social turpitude.The Punisher should be well-recieved by fans of the comic.

836506,A13TO1ZFAH9SVN,B0002IQMAM,Matthew Edmundson,"[0, 5]","This is suppose to be a comic book movie. It's very far from it.The Punisher has a pretty simple story. Frank Castle(Thomas Jane) is a retired FBI agent. In his last case a ganglords son is gunned down. Howard Saint(John Trovolta) gets revenge by murdering all of saints family members at a family reunion. They kill him or so they think so, and now Castle is back and looking for his revenge.I read The Punisher comic books when I was younger and I must say I was disappointed with the movie. This is suppose to be a comic book movie where the target audience should be between 10 and 20 in ages. They didn't even attempt to make this a PG-13 movie and it bugs me. I know Frank Castle is a very dark character. He's a very mad character and he's a very violent character.The Violence in the movie is incredible. I couldn't believe how far they took things. I was expecting violence and the comic books were violent, but never to this extent. You never saw people get shot up like this. You never saw anybody get tourted like they do in this. When they rip the guys piercing out of his face I cringed. I never cringe in movies, but this was like watching Scarface. Everybody is sadistic. There's boiling water flying on people and it's a very violent film and in the top five that I've ever scene. The movie didn't need to be that violent though.In the comics Frank Castle never did the things he did in this movie. He didn't do the sadistic planning like he does in the movie. In this film he's planning his revenge like Dumas has Dantes do in The Count of Monte Cristo. Castle was never that sadistic in the comic.The language was also pretty bad and there is some brief nudity. They made no attempt to make it a PG-13 movie. This is the biggest problem I had with the film, because like I said this is a film geared towards teenagers.Thomas Jane was good as Frank Castle. It was a grea piece of casting and he played the part perfect. He looked exactly like the man from the comic and he played it to perfection. The script could have been better but I liked him a lot.This is a very violent film that didn't hold true to its roots. At times it was a very comic book movie.

Of course the first 30 minutes or so was a little slow and all, but they had to show you why he becomes the punisher. I love how they made the Punisher the sorta Punisher he is in his newer comics (newer as in the last 2 years or so). Him living in his apartment building was very cool to me and seeing the guy with all the piercings was also very cool since both are in the comics. And the Russian is too. So when they said, ""Send in The Russian."", I started saying HECK YEAH!!! Cause he is INSANE in the comics. Just about everything the Punisher does to him, he just takes it like a toddler was hitting him. He talks a little though in the comics and it's funny as hell and I sorta wish they made him talk a little in the movie... but I think Keving Nash probably wouldn't have a good russian accent. He also wore the red and white striped shirt too. So I think they did us comic book fans justice with that stuff. Another thing that did us fans justice were the ways people died. Some of them were just crazy. My friend was saying things like..that was kinda cool, but there is no way that would happen. I then would say, yeah, but thats the kinda ways he kills people in the comics. The writers/drawers think of some INSANE ways to kill people and make you laugh with it.As for a regular movie not revolved around a comic, I would give this movie a 3/5. It was sorta slow in the beginning trying to get you to feel for his family and feel the love he has for his family. Some of the action scenes were a little over the top. Travolta is a GENIOUS at playing a bad guy. He's got that cold killer look when he wants it. Tom Jane I think did a great Punisher. He has the build and what seems like, the right voice.As for a movie based on a comic, I'm gonna have to give this a 4.5/5. It had a lot of good cameos from people we've seen in the comics. It had some really messed up/funny deaths. It shows that the Punisher is actually human cause he gets his butt BEAT. I really liked it and thought it did the Punisher justice.If there is going to be a part 2, I bet it will be much better than part 1, since we dont have to go through and figure out why he becomes the Punisher.",4,Great comic book movie / OK movie for non comic fans,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2234,"['Watched', 'movie', 'Saturday', 'really', 'really', 'liked', 'course', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'had', 'show', 'why', 'punisher', 'love', 'how', 'made', 'Punisher', 'sorta', 'Punisher', 'newer', 'comics', 'newer', 'last', '2', 'years', 'so', 'Him', 'living', 'apartment', 'building', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'seeing', 'guy', 'piercings', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'cool', 'are', 'comics', 'Russian', 'too', 'So', 'when', 'said', 'Send', 'Russian', 'started', 'saying', 'HECK', 'YEAH', 'Cause', 'INSANE', 'comics', 'Just', 'everything', 'Punisher', 'just', 'toddler', 'was', 'hitting', 'little', 'comics', 'funny', 'hell', 'sorta', 'wish', 'made', 'talk', 'little', 'movie', 'think', 'Keving', 'Nash', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'russian', 'accent', 'also', 'wore', 'red', 'white', 'striped', 'shirt', 'too', 'So', 'think', 'did', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'justice', 'stuff', 'thing', 'did', 'fans', 'justice', 'were', 'ways', 'people', 'died', 'were', 'just', 'crazy', 'friend', 'was', 'saying', 'things', 'was', 'kinda', 'cool', 'way', 'would', 'happen', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'yeah', 'kinda', 'ways', 'people', 'comics', 'writers/drawers', 'think', 'INSANE', 'ways', 'kill', 'people', 'make', 'it.As', 'regular', 'movie', 'not', 'revolved', 'comic', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '3/5', 'was', 'sorta', 'slow', 'beginning', 'trying', 'get', 'feel', 'family', 'feel', 'love', 'family', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'little', 'top', 'Travolta', 'GENIOUS', 'playing', 'bad', 'guy', 'got', 'cold', 'killer', 'look', 'when', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'Punisher', 'build', 'what', 'right', 'voice.As', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', ""'m"", 'gon', 'have', 'give', '4.5/5', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'cameos', 'people', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'comics', 'had', 'really', 'messed', 'up/funny', 'deaths', 'Punisher', 'actually', 'human', 'cause', 'butt', 'BEAT', 'really', 'liked', 'thought', 'did', 'Punisher', 'justice.If', 'going', 'be', 'part', '2', 'bet', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'part', '1', 'dont', 'have', 'go', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Punisher']",N/A

Yet another comic book is turned into a movie, but this one has a slight difference to the others that have suddenly appeared in the last couple of years. My opinion is that the film doesn't have that big a name star. Like Jim Caviezel (I know he doesn't star in a comic-book-turned movie, but you know what I mean), Thomas Jane hasn't really starred in that many big movies, or they've been supporting roles. (I have seen him before: in The Last Time I Committed Suicide as Neal Cassady - bad film). Every other comic book-turned-movie has had a relatively big star at the helm. Thomas Jane looks older than a lot of the previous big name stars, and can actually grow a decent looking beards, rather than the bum fluff that Tobey Macguire could only hope to grow. (Oooooooh beards! *drool*)If you've seen the Mad Max movies (I've only seen the first one, but have the other two in my collection to watch at some point in the far off future) you will see some similarities in the plots. Unfortunately, we don't get to see Thomas Jane in tight leather pants, but instead, he resurrects the white vest (sometimes other colours) from Die Hard, and looks quite nice. Until you see the hairy chest. Ugh! With the supervision of a trainer, Thomas Jane worked out extensively for the role with two hours of weight lifting and cardio, sometimes twice a day and a rigorous diet of health shakes. He also trained with multiple firearms and weaponry.Ever since Danny Zuko, John Travolta seems to have played mainly big hard bad guys, and the only good one seems to have been his character in Pulp Fiction. How he still manages to get roles is beyond me!A good point about this movie is the severe lack of CGI special effects, instead staying with the old & good formula from old action scenes. It's really noticeable during this, and you appreciate the movie more because of it. It's also a lot grittier and more gothic than many other comic book-turned-movies out there.I found this film slow to start with, which is the problem with all comic-book-turned-movies. You have to get all the background to the characters first, for all of us who haven't read comic books in years, never mind collect the things! The first half hour is tedious, but I was in tears after the first half hour, it's so brutal! If a film I didn't particularly want to see in the first place can have that effect on me, then it's gonna be good.Lets face it, these comic-books-turned-movies are gonna be churned out as long as Hollywood can keep buying the rights or whatever nonsense it is to them. They're not going to stop anytime soon. There's always the Beano & Dandy yet! :) If you're a fan of comic books, then you'll either love this movie or you'll hate it, due to your devotion to the original (but not necessarily best) comic book. You really don't need to be a comic book maniac to see this movie. I enjoyed it.

I won't argue the choice because it did help give the movie it's own personality.Thomas Jane strikes the right chord in the title role. After the brutal murder of his entire family, Frank Castle takes justice into his own hands. Or, more appropriately, he decides to punish the drug/money laundering kingpin (John Travolta) who ordered the hit.Travolta seems to be having a blast chewing the scenery as Howard Saint. Motivated by Castle's ""betrayal"" of his youngest son, who is killed in a drug bust gone wrong, Saint sicks his hired assassins on Castle. All of whom meet a bloody end. Will Patton, an underrated actor who manages to make any movie more interesting just by showing up for work, is Saint's right hand man.Along the way, Castle befriends the fellow outcasts in his run down apartment building.

The inclusion of this trio adds some warmth and humor to the otherwise dark proceedings.Jonathan Hensleigh directs like a junior John Woo; the film is violent, and there are some exceptionally good action scenes.  Kevin Nash as the Russian is awesome in his short battle with poor Frank.Thomas Jane has been accused of being lifeless and dull--I found him very good in the role.  If your whole family and life had been obliterated, how would YOU act?  While vigilante justice isn't to be condoned, IN A FILM LIKE THIS, you cheer for Jane to take care of the vile group.  Will Patton as the gay henchman, Samantha Mathis as Castle's doomed wife are also excellent.Critically bombed unjustly, I recommend this film for people who like action and seeing justice served.",5,SWEET REVENGE,1095724800,"09 21, 2004",2004,1793,"['comic', 'book', 'movie', 'folks', 'So', 'one', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Stander', 'Dreamcatcher', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'special', 'FBI', 'agent', 'involvement', 'sting', 'operation', 'results', 'death', 'son', 'nasty', 'criminal', 'named', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'played', 'ever', 'evil', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Travolta', 'revenge', 'have', 'Castle', 'killed', 'dear', 'Salome-like', 'wife', 'Livia', 'torchy', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'Castle', 'whole', 'family', 'wiped', 'out', 'accomplished', 'family', 'reunion', 'Castle', 'family', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'Dad', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'Castle', 'whole', 'family', 'are', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'Castle', 'shot', 'left', 'dead', 'Mistake', '1', 'big', 'one', 'Castle', 'back', 'health', 'out', 'even', 'score', 'out', 'dumpy', 'apartment', 'building', 'where', 'good', 'neighbors', 'include', 'Rebecca', 'Stamjin-Stamos', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'delightful', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Dave', 'nose/eyebrow/mouth-studded', 'wimp', 'loyalty', 'friendship', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'inclusion', 'trio', 'warmth', 'humor', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'proceedings.Jonathan', 'Hensleigh', 'junior', 'John', 'Woo', 'film', 'violent', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'Kevin', 'Nash', 'Russian', 'awesome', 'short', 'battle', 'poor', 'Frank.Thomas', 'Jane', 'been', 'accused', 'being', 'lifeless', 'dull', 'found', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'whole', 'family', 'life', 'had', 'been', 'obliterated', 'how', 'would', 'YOU', 'act', 'vigilante', 'justice', ""n't"", 'be', 'condoned', 'A', 'FILM', 'LIKE', 'THIS', 'cheer', 'Jane', 'take', 'care', 'vile', 'group', 'Will', 'Patton', 'gay', 'henchman', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'Castle', 'doomed', 'wife', 'are', 'also', 'excellent.Critically', 'bombed', 'unjustly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'action', 'seeing', 'justice', 'served']",N/A
836517,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B0002IQMAM,Michael Crane,"[10, 13]","One of my favorite characters in the world of comics (not to mention the world of fiction), is Frank Castle, a.k.a. &quot;The Punisher.&quot; He's a deeply flawed hero fueled with anger and hatred. He's a realistic character that makes you feel for him in other ways that other comic book heroes cannot. Maybe it's because the man is a real man and not somebody with special powers or abilities. He's just a man with a lot of guns and firepower seeking to dish out his own brand of justice. It is a dark and brutal movie with a lot of violence that will turn away some, but for the people who know what Frank Castle is about will appreciate how he is portrayed in this film.Frank Castle has retired from his rough and dangerous job and now plans to make up for lost time with his family. Only problem is that in his last assignment, the son of a notorious crime lord, Howard Saint, was one of the casualties. Howard orders the death of Castle, and his wife adds, &quot;His whole family.&quot; And that is what happens. Castle's entire family, from his mother and father to his very own son and wife are massacred at what was supposed to be a happy family reunion, but they didn't finish the job as Frank Castle came back alive. Unsatisfied with how the police have been handling the situation, Frank decides it's time for him to take action and dish out justice and punishment his own way. And to start, he decides to take out the people responsible for the deaths of his family.As I said, &quot;The Punisher&quot; is a brutally dark film that is so unlike any of the other comic book movies. This is because that's what &quot;The Punisher&quot; is; a dark tale about a man who goes around killing (not beating up) the bad guys. There's no way they could make this PG-13. In fact, I would've been disgusted if they had. It would've meant the story would be sacrificed. Let's face it, the &quot;Punisher&quot; comic books are no child's tale. So I was happy that they took it to the limit that they did, while I'm sure there will be people who won't be. The movie is extremely well-acted for a comic book movie. Tom Jane is EXCELLENT as &quot;Punisher&quot;, and I hope that if they do make a sequel that he is in it again. John Travolta is even great in this as the bad guy--but they also do a good job of showing his human side rather than just making him a one-dimensional character. The film looks dark and dreary--as it should be--and the overall product is well executed.A great thing that stands out in this film is the actual story going on. It's not non-stop action. Does it make the film slow? At times, yes, but it didn't matter to me because I was so fascinated with what was going on with Castle and how he was coping. Although, I think a few more action scenes of him executing a few more bad guys would've done nicely (the movie has one of the coolest finales I have ever seen in an action movie). There's some great character development in this, which was a big problem with the first &quot;Punisher&quot; that came out years ago. Another plus is that it doesn't try to be overly funny. Sure, there are a few jokes in it (to lighten the movie up somewhat), but they don't overdo it. The only real problem I had with it was that I wanted to see more. I didn't want it to end. It made me want to see more of Frank Castle proceeding with his mission to wipe out criminals. I really hope that they make a sequel, and I really hope that they use Tom Jane again.&quot;The Punisher&quot; succeeds in what it tries to achieve. It's a great and dark story about loss and justice. It's about the mind frame of someone who has lost everything at the hands of a criminal. I must warn you that this is no movie for little kids. The movie is rated R, and it lives up to that very rating. All in all, I was extremely pleased with this movie and I can't wait to own it on DVD. A terrific movie for people who admire dark and flawed heroes who have lost more than they can handle. -Michael Crane",4,&quot;Frank Castle is dead...&quot; (4.5 stars),1082678400,"04 23, 2004",2004,3994,"['One', 'favorite', 'characters', 'world', 'comics', 'not', 'mention', 'world', 'fiction', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'a.k.a', 'quot', 'Punisher.', 'quot', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'hero', 'fueled', 'anger', 'hatred', 'realistic', 'character', 'feel', 'other', 'ways', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'can', 'not', 'Maybe', 'man', 'real', 'man', 'not', 'somebody', 'special', 'powers', 'abilities', 'just', 'man', 'lot', 'guns', 'firepower', 'seeking', 'dish', 'out', 'own', 'brand', 'justice', 'dark', 'brutal', 'movie', 'lot', 'violence', 'will', 'turn', 'away', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'about', 'will', 'appreciate', 'how', 'portrayed', 'film.Frank', 'Castle', 'retired', 'rough', 'dangerous', 'job', 'now', 'make', 'up', 'lost', 'time', 'family', 'Only', 'problem', 'last', 'assignment', 'son', 'notorious', 'crime', 'lord', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'was', 'one', 'casualties', 'Howard', 'orders', 'death', 'Castle', 'wife', 'quot', 'whole', 'family.', 'quot', 'what', 'Castle', 'entire', 'family', 'mother', 'father', 'very', 'own', 'son', 'wife', 'are', 'massacred', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'happy', 'family', 'reunion', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'job', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'came', 'back', 'alive', 'Unsatisfied', 'how', 'police', 'have', 'been', 'handling', 'situation', 'Frank', 'time', 'take', 'action', 'dish', 'out', 'justice', 'punishment', 'own', 'way', 'start', 'take', 'out', 'people', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'family.As', 'said', 'quot', 'Punisher', 'quot', 'brutally', 'dark', 'film', 'so', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'what', 'quot', 'Punisher', 'quot', 'dark', 'tale', 'man', 'who', 'killing', 'not', 'beating', 'up', 'bad', 'guys', 'way', 'could', 'make', 'PG-13', 'fact', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'disgusted', 'had', 'would', ""'ve"", 'meant', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'Let', 'face', 'quot', 'Punisher', 'quot', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'child', 'tale', 'was', 'happy', 'took', 'limit', 'did', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'extremely', 'well-acted', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'EXCELLENT', 'quot', 'Punisher', 'quot', 'hope', 'do', 'make', 'sequel', 'again', 'John', 'Travolta', 'even', 'great', 'bad', 'guy', 'also', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'human', 'side', 'rather', 'just', 'making', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'film', 'dark', 'dreary', 'should', 'be', 'overall', 'product', 'well', 'executed.A', 'great', 'thing', 'out', 'film', 'actual', 'story', 'going', 'not', 'non-stop', 'action', 'make', 'film', 'slow', 'times', 'yes', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'was', 'so', 'fascinated', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Castle', 'how', 'was', 'coping', 'think', 'few', 'more', 'action', 'scenes', 'executing', 'few', 'more', 'bad', 'guys', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'nicely', 'movie', 'one', 'coolest', 'finales', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'action', 'movie', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'big', 'problem', 'first', 'quot', 'Punisher', 'quot', 'came', 'out', 'years', 'ago', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'overly', 'funny', 'Sure', 'are', 'few', 'jokes', 'lighten', 'movie', 'up', 'somewhat', 'do', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'proceeding', 'mission', 'wipe', 'out', 'criminals', 'really', 'hope', 'make', 'sequel', 'really', 'hope', 'use', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'again.', 'quot', 'Punisher', 'quot', 'what', 'achieve', 'great', 'dark', 'story', 'loss', 'justice', 'mind', 'frame', 'someone', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'hands', 'criminal', 'must', 'warn', 'movie', 'little', 'kids', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'up', 'very', 'rating', 'was', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'own', 'DVD', 'A', 'terrific', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'admire', 'dark', 'flawed', 'heroes', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'more', 'can', 'handle', '-Michael', 'Crane']",N/A

836522,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0002IQMAM,mirasreviews,"[47, 55]","This cinematic version of ""The  Punisher"" is based on Marvel Comics' most recent incarnation of the vigilante anti-hero, as written by Garth Ennis in the ""Welcome Back Frank"" series. Although his ability to survive the most violent circumstances is extraordinary, the character has largely been removed from the world of superheroes. He's human and imperfect. The Punisher's backstory has been changed for the film to better integrate it with the narrative. A backstory that is not directly related to the present could never be successful in a film. Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is an undercover FBI agent looking forward to the time with his family that his imminent retirement will allow. Those plans come to a horrific end when organized crime boss Howard Saint (John Travolta), whose son was killed in a gun running bust, takes revenge on Castle's family. Devastated, angry, and with nothing left to lose, Castle sets out to return the favor by destroying Saint and his criminal empire.""The Punisher"" is filmed in a dark, gritty style that seems to have been inspired by the work of cover artist Tim Bradstreet and the cin&eacute;ma verit&eacute; of the 1970s. The lead-in that describes how Frank Castle becomes The Punisher is lengthy, but that's to be expected in the first film of a potential franchise. The violence is pretty graphic in places and probably not for the weak of stomach. For an ""action film"", ""The Punisher"" isn't especially active. The action is intermittent, builds as the film progresses, and tends to avoid grand gestures. Perhaps that's appropriate, as the violence is of a personal nature. The cast is consistently interesting. Thomas Jane does a solid job as The Punisher, a shattered man who never claims any moral high ground. John Travolta is particularly entertaining as the ruthless, petulant crime boss Howard Saint. Travolta gives a palpably restrained performance, playing Saint just slightly over-the-top and imbalanced to great effect. Will Patton is also notable as Howard Saint's sociopathic right-hand man, Quentin Glass. And Rebecca Romijn-Stamos has a supporting role as one of Frank Castle's dysfunctional neighbors, who provide a little comic relief. An interesting piece of cast trivia: Howard Saint's sons, Bobby and John, are played by the same actor, James Carpinello, and originally were intended to be twin brothers. When Carpinello was in make-up and costume, he looked so dissimilar as the brothers that director Jonathan Hensleigh decided that they shouldn't be twins.The most striking aspect of this film isn't at all evident: It was made for a paltry $30 million -unheard of for an action film. That it looks like it cost twice that much is a credit to the director, cinematographer, and art director. Also notable is that none of the film's stunts are CGI. They look real, and they are. ""The Punisher"" is entertaining and visually interesting. My only complaint about the film is its pace, which is brooding and too even for an action film. That makes the film seem longer than it is.The DVD: This is a nicely loaded disc. Bonus features include 4 featurettes, 2 deleted scenes with director's commentary, a music video for ""Step Up"" by Drowning Pool, a trailer for ""The Punisher"" video game, and an audio commentary by director Jonathan Hensleigh. The first featurette, ""Keepin' it Real"" (25 minutes) is about the film's stunts. This documentary discusses the processes of designing and filming the stunts, through interviews with stunt coordinator Gary Hymes and director Jonathan Hensleigh, among others. It might have been better organized and more informative if the documentary had taken us through a few stunts in detail instead of giving an overview. The second featurette, ""War Journal"" (30 minutes) is a broad making-of documentary that takes us through pre-production, production, editing and scoring in post-production, and winds up at the film's premiere. This is a well-organized, comprehensive documentary that includes interviews with line producer John Stark and director Jonathan Hensleigh, in which he talks about the challenges of making an action film on a $30 million budget and shooting in only 50 days. The third featurette, ""Army of One"" (12 minutes) is about ""The Punisher""'s comic book origins. The genesis and evolution of the character in Marvel Comics are discussed in interviews with Gerry Conway, who created ""The Punisher"" as a Spider-Man villain in 1972, Stephen Grant, who wrote the character from 1986-1994, current writer Garth Ennis, Marvel art director John Romita, and cover artist Tim Bradstreet, as well as Marvel CEO Avi Arad and Vice President Ari Avad. This documentary is very helpful to those of us who don't read comic books in explaining the character's origins. The last featurette, ""Drawing Blood Bradstreet Style"" (5 minutes) focuses on cover artist Tim Bradstreet, who also designed the film's theatrical posters and heavily influenced the movie's visual style. The film's audio commentary by director Jonathan Hensleigh is very good. He speaks clearly and doesn't meander when explaining the decisions he made concerning story, style, characters and cinematography. His comments are particularly interesting, because ""The Punisher"" is an admirable example of efficient, economical filmmaking.

Thanks to some of the amazon.com reviewers giving it 4 or 5 stars, I thought maybe it would be better than the critics thought and I knew it had to be much better than Daredevil. This movie is so much fun from start to finish! Way better than Daredevil or The Hulk and to me just as good as the first two Spiderman films. The action is good throughout without going too over the top and the creative kills were a nice touch to an already violent movie. Tom Jane nails the part of Frank Castle here and is a joy to behold as his character changes from family man to a one man assault team. I heard John Travolta went over the top here, but to me he plays a pretty laid back bad guy and I like what he did with this role. Yes, the neighbors are a little annoying (they were in the comics too), but there screen time is limited. The only character I really didn't was the model turned actress who played the third neighbor. She just couldn't act and got on my nerves fast.

A compelling group of actors deliver a movie which is ultimately so hardboiled in its revenge story that there are no redeeming moments to make you feel at all uplifted.Frank Castle is an undercover agent who in the course of his duties is indirectly responsible for the killing of the son of the city's ruthless criminal businessman - Howard Saint (John Travolta).  Saint (or more accurately his wife) gets revenge, slaughtering Castle's whole family.  It is at this point you realise two things.  One, that everyone in the movie gets killed several times - Castle for example is left for dead after being beaten up, shot, doused in gasoline, blown up, and presumed drowned.  And two, that things are not going to get any more cheerful from here on in.  Castle survives and becomes `The Punisher', enacting bloody and graphic revenge on everyone connected to Howard Saint.While the plot is not incredibly original, the execution starts out quite satisfying.  Tom Jane fits the role well, and John Travolta does his best to make the villain more than one dimensional.  The always reliable Will Patton puts in a good turn as Travolta's sadistic best friend, hit man and general helper.  Castle's new neighbours are an eclectic bunch whose roles are slightly more than the mere fillers they could have been, headed by Rebecca Romin (best known as Mystique, from X-Men).  The style retains a little of its comic book origins and has more than a few moments of spaghetti-western-style shootouts.  However, as the brutality goes on and on, the weak stomached may grow tired and wish for some redemption along the way.In short, as far from a feel good movie as you can get - if you can stomach bloody action then there is merit hidden in here.

836537,A20ZFWGBY4REFX,B0002IQMAM,"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan""","[2, 3]","I just checked out ""The Punisher"" at the theater a couple of days ago, and let me just say that the film was action-packed from pulse-pounding start to heart-stopping finish! The direction of Jonathan Hensleigh (screenwriter for ""Armageddon"") was nothing short of excellent or intense! This new version of ""The Punisher"" was, without a doubt, way, way better than the old 1989 Dolph Lundgren version, especially since this popular Marvel comic-book adaption explains more of the Frank Castle character in-depth, etc. The performance of Thomas Jane (""Dreamcatcher"") as Frank Castle/The Punisher was extraordinary! The finest performance of Jane's career! The performance of John Travolta (""Get Shorty""), back in bad-guy form as Castle's villainous counterpart, Howard Saint, was electrifying and powerful! Travolta's best villainous performance since ""Swordfish"" and ""Face/Off""! Rounding out the cast are Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (""X2: X-Men United""), Will Patton (""Entrapment""), Roy Scheider (""Jaws""), Laura Harring (""Mulholland Dr.""), Ben Foster (""Liberty Heights""), and Samantha Mathis (Travolta's ""Broken Arrow"" co-star), in which they, too, gave unforgettable performances alongside the two leads!""The Punisher"" puts the focus on Frank Castle (Jane), a man who has seen too much death in his life, first as a former Delta Force operative and later as an undercover FBI special agent. He has managed to beat considerable odds, and is finally moving out of the field and into a normal life with his wife, Maria (Mathis), and young son, Will. On his final assignment, Castle plays his undercover role perfectly, but the operation spins out of control and a young man, Bobby Saint (James Carpinello), is inadvertently killed in the process. The end result places the FBI on the wrong side of Tampa businessman Howard Saint (Travolta) and his glamorous wife, Livia (Harring). Notwithstanding their glossy social profile, the Saints are no genteel Florida couple; behind their copious wealth are violent beginnings, underworld ties -- and a chilling capacity for brutality. Inflamed by the death of their son, the Saints are willing to risk their newfound legitimacy on a wholesale mission of blood-vengeance. Castle's worst nightmare is about to come true, as Howard Saint and his lieutenants unleash hell at the Castle family reunion, with Maria and Will killed in the process.But Castle, to his everlasting torment, survives. Until this moment, he has spent his entire life adhering strictly to the law. However, experience has taught him that the law cannot adequately penalize the people who murdered his family. Drawing upon all he has learned in 20 years, Castle sets in motion a plan to punish the murderers. He takes up residence in a dilapidated tenement building in Tampa's industrial district, where his fellow tenants include Joan (Stamos), a waitress at a nearby diner who is trying to put her life back on track; Dave (Foster), a gangly twenty-something with a face full of piercings; and Bumpo (John Pinette), a rotund gourmand who rarely leaves his home.In preparing his revenge, Castle thoroughly familiarizes himself with the habits and routines of the Saint family. He traces the movements not only of Howard and Livia, but also their surviving son, John (also played by Carpinello), and Howard's second-in-command, lawyer Quentin Glass (Patton). Armed with this essential knowledge, Castle launches his first salvo against Saint's business interests. Stunned that Castle is not only alive but causing him harm, Saint marshals his forces in an attempt to shut Castle down permanently. He soon turns to the underworld's network of hired assassins, recruiting the laconic Memphis legend Harry Heck (Mark Collie) as well as the blonde behemoth known only as the Russian (WWE superstar Kevin Nash).Castle's plan is proceeding apace, but his mission has the unintended effect of placing his fellow tenement dwellers in danger. Yet Joan, Dave, and Bumpo rally for their neighbor, even at great personal risk. This makeshift family -- forgotten men and women with no one to protect them -- brings Castle the one thing he least expects: redemption. His personal goal achieved, Castle realizes that his life's work has just begun. As The Punisher, he will provide justice for ordinary people and exact retribution from society's villains.In conclusion, ""The Punisher"", to me, is a whole lot better than recent Marvel comic-book duds as ""Daredevil"" and ""The Hulk""! Also, ""The Punisher"" has it all: lots and lots of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat, powerful storyline, some laugh-out-loud humor, and a pulsating soundtrack!

836538,A3NQI2JLNPFOF8,B0002IQMAM,"nico_laos ""nico""","[3, 3]",".......pre-judge a film ever again without seeing it first.  I had been talking trash about this movie ever since the first teaser trailer.  Being a long time Punisher fan, and an avid reader of Garth Ennis' current run on the series, I felt deeply betrayed when I found out that the Punisher would only be in his mid-thirties (as opposed to around 50 in the comic) and that the story would take place in Tampa, Florida as opposed to a gritty New York setting.  The Punisher should be the easiest comic book adaptation ever.  He's a vigilante with no superpowers who takes out organized crime.  It's so simple it's stupid.  If masterpieces like Spider-Man and X-Men could be faithfully portrayed on the big screen, then Punisher should be a cake walk.  I was sure that it would be terrible and the critic reviews supported this theory.  Well, I wouldn't ever be satisified unless I saw it, so about a week before it left the theater, I sat in an empty screenroom around noon on a wednesday and saw The Punisher.Well, despite the changes, I really liked the film.  Liked it enough to buy it, even.  It's not without it's faults, but it was far better than the previous Dolph Lundren version and a whole lot better than Daredevil which I proclaim a worse movie than Gigli.  I liked Castle's heavy drinking and often depressed state of being.  I liked how he didn't just kill Saint...he turned everyone he trusted against him...then killed him.  I liked the references to the Garth Ennis series (Joan, Dave, and Bumpo were characters created by Ennis in the comic).  Even some of the scenes from the original Ennis limited series were added; such as the fight with Russian, the spring-loaded knife, and Dave getting his piercings pulled out.  And the popsicle-torture scene was taken from an issue from the early-eighties.  I loved it.So, yeah, I would have liked it if Castle was a Vietnam vet in his fifties.  I would have preferred that he hunted down organized crime lords in New York instead of Florida.  But I still had fun with this.  The lesson learned here is: I had preconceived ideas about this movie, and I had listened to all the critics and stayed away from it intitially....but I ended up really liking it.  So my advise to you is to not make up your mind about something until you see it; and don't listen to what the critics say.  Really....who cares what they think.  They get paid the same whether they like it or not.",4,I won't ever.......,1097193600,"10 8, 2004",2004,2434,"['.pre-judge', 'film', 'ever', 'again', 'seeing', 'first', 'had', 'been', 'talking', 'trash', 'movie', 'ever', 'first', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'Being', 'long', 'time', 'Punisher', 'fan', 'avid', 'reader', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'current', 'run', 'series', 'felt', 'deeply', 'betrayed', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Punisher', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'mid-thirties', 'opposed', '50', 'comic', 'story', 'would', 'take', 'place', 'Tampa', 'Florida', 'opposed', 'gritty', 'New', 'York', 'setting', 'Punisher', 'should', 'be', 'easiest', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'ever', 'vigilante', 'superpowers', 'who', 'out', 'organized', 'crime', 'so', 'simple', 'stupid', 'masterpieces', 'Spider-Man', 'X-Men', 'could', 'be', 'faithfully', 'portrayed', 'big', 'screen', 'then', 'Punisher', 'should', 'be', 'cake', 'walk', 'was', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'terrible', 'critic', 'reviews', 'supported', 'theory', 'Well', 'would', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'satisified', 'saw', 'so', 'week', 'left', 'theater', 'sat', 'empty', 'screenroom', 'around', 'noon', 'wednesday', 'saw', 'Punisher.Well', 'changes', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'Liked', 'enough', 'buy', 'even', 'not', 'faults', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'previous', 'Dolph', 'Lundren', 'version', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'Daredevil', 'proclaim', 'worse', 'movie', 'Gigli', 'liked', 'Castle', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'often', 'depressed', 'state', 'being', 'liked', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'kill', 'Saint', 'turned', 'everyone', 'trusted', 'then', 'killed', 'liked', 'references', 'Garth', 'Ennis', 'series', 'Joan', 'Dave', 'Bumpo', 'were', 'characters', 'created', 'Ennis', 'comic', 'Even', 'scenes', 'original', 'Ennis', 'limited', 'series', 'were', 'added', 'such', 'fight', 'Russian', 'spring-loaded', 'knife', 'Dave', 'getting', 'piercings', 'pulled', 'out', 'popsicle-torture', 'scene', 'was', 'taken', 'issue', 'early-eighties', 'loved', 'it.So', 'yeah', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Castle', 'was', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'fifties', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'hunted', 'down', 'organized', 'crime', 'lords', 'New', 'York', 'instead', 'Florida', 'still', 'had', 'fun', 'lesson', 'learned', 'here', 'had', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'movie', 'had', 'listened', 'critics', 'stayed', 'away', 'intitially', '.but', 'ended', 'up', 'really', 'liking', 'advise', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'something', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'what', 'critics', 'say', 'Really', '.who', 'what', 'think', 'get', 'paid', 'same', 'like', 'not']",N/A
836539,A2U4H0649HI9CE,B0002IQMAM,nir085,"[6, 7]","Fantastically brilliant. I must say, before this movie got released, heck, before the weekend this movie opened, I had no interest whatsoever in The Punisher. I put it aside like I did Ghost Rider, Green Lantern, and the Fantastic Four.That changed.This movie is not for everyone. It's a dour, sadistic tale of vengeance or, as Frank Castle would put it, ""Punishment"". Come to think of it, it's not even really for all fans of the Punisher comic book fans (yes, I have read up on the Punisher comic series after the movie release). The villains never existed in the comics, the circumstances of his family's death was different in just about every way, and Castle was never an FBI agent either. It's nothing like the comic books. In some ways, it's better. Yeah, I said it, Punisher comic fans. For example, the way his family got killed in the comics were boooooring. Big deal, two people close to him get killed because of an accident: that's a reason for him to hate criminals but not to hunt down every single one in the world. In the movie, it does give you a reason for him to hate them and rampage their balls out. He was a completely innocent man before that incident, a man who took compassion on scum and didn't like to kill. The typical honorable, happy American citizen. That was until a band of scum wiped out his entire family, the day after he retired, the day of a family reunion. All because of a person he never even murdered in the first place. Now THAT'S a reason to become The Punisher. Also take the comic book adaptation of the movie into consideration. That was complete crap. No emotional impact, characters looked nothing like they should have looked to fill their roles, scenes are omitted, and the Punisher was a complete jerk in comparison (he even tries to kill his former partner...that is horrible and stupid). Don't get me wrong, I love the comics too, I just think that people should be appreciating the refinements the movie made to Castle's character instead of evaluating how much it follows the comic books.Actors were well cast for their roles in this movie - screw what others think. Of course, I can't say with certainty that they were well cast for their roles in the movie, so let me restate what I was meaning to say: they were well cast, period. (For example, Howard Saint may have supposed to be more sinister, but I liked him more as a character who was just a little bit more evil than the Punisher). Thomas Jane was wonderful. Unlike Lundgren, Jane was focused, dour, (insanely) cool, and actually looked like a firm cop, instead of a drunk beggar with a Harley. Lots have said that John Travolta plays a deathly dull villain. I disagree. You could almost feel compassion for the guy: he wasn't a rapist, a person who wanted mass genocide, or a mafia boss; he was just a ruthless, intolerant businessman. If it wasn't for Castle, he would have probably remained on good terms with both his wife and Quentin for the rest of his life. This is a good thing because it kind of makes you wonder: who is the good guy and bad guy in this movie? Howard Saint wanted to avenge his son's murder. For a villain, that's a justified and honorable move. That showed his love for him, even if how he showed it was wrong. Frank Castle became an avenger but at the same time he also became that which he hated the most at the time: a mirror reflection of Saint. If Saint was portrayed as a pure devil instead of just an unfortunate, corrupt businessman, the story would have turned into (more of a) traditional tale of good vs. evil. Which would have been boring as a first film. The neighbors were VERY necessary for the movie. Those who think otherwise are absolute morons. Not only did their roles show how Frank Castle would act in normal situations, but they also allowed for a grim story to have some degree of comedy, so that it could actually appeal to a worldwide audience more. The women in this movie couldn't have been better picked either. They were drop-dead gorgeous in just about every way possible.Also, I'd like to address some of the ignorant whining I've heard about The Punisher. Every scene did have a purpose. The massacre being that brutal, depressing, and extended was absolutely necessary for creating the emotional and philosophical foundation that the movie was meant to stand on. I'm no medical doctor, but Frank Castle getting shot, even in the chest, and surviving does seem realistic. For those critics who have never done anything in life other than review movies - people in the real world get shot in the upper body and still manage to survive. In an explosion too you might ask? Well Castle was basically on the outskirts of the blast and he was blasted into water, not off a cliff or into another explosion. As for when Castle got shot later on in the movie...he was wearing a bulletproof vest. The movie wasn't that predictable either. Maybe people think it was because the trailer gave away a lot, but you should really have no clue how any of the bad guys die, especially Mrs. Saint, how evil the bad guys are, if Mickey will betray Castle, etc.. It was NOT like the stereotypical revenge movie. It's just, not, and there are too many ways I could say that. Those who complain about things like these are either a.) morons who can't decipher the meaning of a masterpiece or b.) people who are not into this subgenre (most people are not).The Punisher score was awesome as well. I'm not much for movie albums (I don't see their point...), but the creepiness, tenderness, and/or grim resolution of the songs (depending on the song) perfectly illustrates the moods portrayed in the movie. I could almost re-imagine a scene when the songs played. Too bad Carlo Siliotto's only big movie score has been this one. No dorky Drowning Pool music can ever be serious enough to properly convey the atmosphere of the Punisher; still, the ""Step up"" song did work for a trailer. Sort of. But the Seether song in the Punisher TV spot...what the hell? The TV spot would have been great otherwise...but that song does not fit the Punisher at all. What I'm trying to say is: get the Movie score now.I can't wait until the DVD comes out. Granted the cover art could be a little bit more appealing, but the bleak, simple look kind of hints at the contents of the DVD anyways. A simple cover also leaves room for a special edition Punisher DVD (with a better cover). I think it's cool how they are going to give the Punisher (movie) fans a 28 page comic. It's the movie, after all, that got me into the comics, not the other way around. Maybe I'll post an additional review if the DVD has any notable flaws. But since I doubt that, considering the genius of Jonathan Hansleigh and Garth Ennis, just assume I'll give it five stars. Which I'm sure I will.The Punisher movie (2004) was awesome. I like it because, even though it is based on a comic series, it shows a more realistic side of life than those movies that are based on true stories, because those stories are not ""true stories"" in my eyes. Not everyone achieves touching, inspirational victories despite their previously low status in life. Not everyone fights in a war. Not everyone teenage loser fights a hot girl in a nightclub and gets laid. But everyone, whether it is an innocent FBI agent/Delta Ops agent/who wanted to be a priest before, a wealthy Florida businessman,  or a lawyer/loyal best friend holds the capacity for pure, unrestrained evil.",5,A VERY well-executed movie,1091232000,"07 31, 2004",2004,7466,"['Fantastically', 'brilliant', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'got', 'released', 'heck', 'weekend', 'movie', 'opened',

Have you watched Daredevil (2003)?  Have you watched Spiderman (2002)?  Have you watched Blade 2 (2002)?  Have you watched The League of Extraordinary Gentelmen (2003)?If not, then go watch them all and then realise that The Punisher (2004) will be the LEAST of your worries.And to Jen, I believe in everything you said except that...  The Punisher is your favourite hero?I've news for you: he's not a hero.  He never has been a hero.  He may work as an idol, but not a hero.  See, he's an anti-hero.Anti-heroes are known for doing things their way (much like The Punisher) and outside of the law (those are vigilanties).Anti-heros include Lobo, Ash (from the Evil Dead series), and Batman.Everything they do is illegal.  Everything they do is destructive.  But everything they do is for their own personal benefit and what they wish to benefit from are good-intented turning-of-the-tables.They are the favourites because they ARE NOT heroes.  They don't care for standards and living conditions as long as they are happy.  What makes us happy about them?  They do everything in a cool way.If an anti-hero is forgiven by the authorities, then that's just Hollywood for yah.This new version of The Punisher has not yet entered theatres anywhere (in the world) ao no one (including myself) can critisize it.  But it does look bad.The original adaptation, the one that was more truthful than this new one, was not a GOOD movie, but not a bad adaptation of the comics.It was dark, it was violent, it had the vigilante living underground and mourning his family, it had the vigilante without a job and AVOIDING the police, and it had a violent Hollywood confrontional ending which was suitable.This new version is very colourful, it contains a man NOT BIG ENOUGH to portray The Punisher, and it will definitely be a big Hollywood action film.I saw the trailers, I can tell.That is all.",1,Another terrible attempted adaptation...,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,2038,"['who', 'wrote', 'Punisher', '2004', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'Marvel', 'Comic-Film', 'will', 'bomb', 'have', 'few', 'questions', 'Have', 'seen', 'Hulk', '2003', 'Have', 'watched', 'Daredevil', '2003', 'Have', 'watched', 'Spiderman', '2002', 'Have', 'watched', '2', '2002', 'Have', 'watched', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentelmen', '2003', 'not', 'then', 'go', 'watch', 'then', 'realise', 'Punisher', '2004', 'will', 'be', 'LEAST', 'worries.And', 'Jen', 'believe', 'everything', 'said', 'Punisher', 'favourite', 'hero', ""'ve"", 'news', 'not', 'hero', 'never', 'been', 'hero', 'may', 'work', 'idol', 'not', 'hero', 'See', 'anti-hero.Anti-heroes', 'are', 'known', 'doing', 'things', 'way', 'much', 'Punisher', 'law', 'are', 'vigilanties', '.Anti-heros', 'include', 'Lobo', 'Ash', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'series', 'Batman.Everything', 'do', 'illegal', 'Everything', 'do', 'destructive', 'everything', 'do', 'own', 'personal', 'benefit', 'what', 'wish', 'benefit', 'are', 'good-intented', 'turning-of-the-tables.They', 'are', 'favourites', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'heroes', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'standards', 'living', 'conditions', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'happy', 'What', 'happy', 'do', 'everything', 'cool', 'way.If', 'anti-hero', 'forgiven', 'authorities', 'then', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'yah.This', 'new', 'version', 'Punisher', 'not', 'yet', 'entered', 'theatres', 'anywhere', 'world', 'one', 'including', 'can', 'critisize', 'look', 'bad.The', 'original', 'adaptation', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'truthful', 'new', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'adaptation', 'comics.It', 'was', 'dark', 'was', 'violent', 'had', 'vigilante', 'living', 'underground', 'mourning', 'family', 'had', 'vigilante', 'job', 'AVOIDING', 'police', 'had', 'violent', 'Hollywood', 'confrontional', 'ending', 'was', 'suitable.This', 'new', 'version', 'very', 'colourful', 'man', 'NOT', 'BIG', 'ENOUGH', 'portray', 'Punisher', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'film.I', 'saw', 'trailers', 'can', 'tell.That']",N/A

Here the superhero is made more real (an ex fed who had his family shot up and is looking for revenge) rather than some supernatural forces at work. With that it is just a joe soap revenge thriller that fails to pack the punch for what it could have been.One reason for the average rating is that we where promised a violent film the kind of which Hollywood has not churned out in quite awhile. Scene stills of The Punisher with a blow-torch in hand looked like it was going to be the real deal. Just turns out he fakes the whole scene and 'pretends' to torture people. Truth be told it is just a heavy PG-13 movie, but nothing pushing the rating the producers said it would have. Also the action is extremely limited considering. You will be surprised by how little of it there is.The only gem that saves the film is Thomas Jane. He is a good actor and can stand up there with the likes of new generation action heros (Diesel and Damon) and for that we have no quarrels. Shame that they just didn't push this film to make it harder.

836547,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B0002IQMAM,P. Hardy,"[0, 1]","Let me begin by first saying that I'm no fan of the Punisher but won't disregard a good movie concerning this Comic Book character, except if its the Punisher movie that was made back way in the 1980s'. That said, I have to say that Tom Jane (Deep blue sea) as the 2004 reincarnation of Marvel Comics The Punisher's Frank Castle (he plays a good grieving Frank Castle without always showing that he is indeed doing just that) was a great selection on the directors(?) part. I enjoyed this movie so much.GOOD: The movie took its time to slowly ease you into the characters of the movie as well as its storyline. It let you get to know Frank Castle's wife, his family as well as his son who are eager to get on with their life after Castle's last mission as an undercover agent (Jane is a convincing 'Bad guy' in the first part of the movie). His mission doesn't go the way he expected when a suspect is killed and thus puts in motion a series of events that change his life for the worst if not for the best for ""fate's"" sake. Frank Castle's entire family is murdered by the order of Howard Saint (a crime lord of sorts who manages to get away with anything) and his Wife upon hearing the death of their youngest (or eldest?) son, the suspect from Castle's last mission. His wife and Son are run over in attempt to escape (""Mad Max"" anyone) their assailants and Frank is shot square in the chest expected to follow suit with the rest of his family but is saved by a friend. He is then supposed dead by the media, but he returns to Tampa Florida with every intent to deal with the those responsible for the death of his entire family, his life.The characters that Castle meets when he moves into an apartment that houses only three people; A woman who obviously has troubles of her own, and two men who are her good friends, are in their own right intersting. Castle doesn't think much of Joan(?) or her friends until one little burst of chaos outside of his door one day throws him into their lives. The acting from all the actors/actresses is well executed, John Travolta plays a believable villain as always, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos' acting is the good and the chemistry between her and Tom Jane is felt through the scenes of interaction of their characters (I'm glad they didn't decide to make them a romantic couple, which happens to be a neverending plauge in movies). The movie also has its own sort of Humor and manages to not to take itself too seriously like the other ""Punisher"" movie had done, plus there was very little involvement with the police department after the first part of the movie. Another good part of this movie is that the movie does not have Frank Castle spewing about justice or rather Punishment when he kills his victims and the violence which I suppose is why the movie was rated R is not over the top and unnecessarily bloody but just right.BAD: The movie moves slowly afterwards for I suppose the sake of keeping it balanced between the action the interaction as well as the storyline. For most of the movie you'll be wondering when The Punisher will ""Punish the guilty"" or in this movie the Saint family and their organization. I wondered constantly wonder why the movie focuses a little more on John Travolta's character and his family but I suppose it was for the sake of giving the movie dimension, however this became a little matter to me when the action started to pick up nearing the end of the movie which I was grateful for. All in all this movie was not bad, I enjoyed watching it despite my low expectations of it. It managed to balance itself out without having too much Action (although there could've been more) and a realistic storyline. ----- [a 4 out of 5]",4,This is cool movie (with its flaws)!,1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,3705,"['Let', 'begin', 'first', 'saying', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Punisher', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disregard', 'good', 'movie', 'concerning', 'Comic', 'Book', 'character', 'Punisher', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'back', 'way', '1980s', 'said', 'have', 'say', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'Deep', 'blue', 'sea', '2004', 'reincarnation', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'Punisher', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'good', 'grieving', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'always', 'showing', 'indeed', 'doing', 'just', 'was', 'great', 'selection', 'directors', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'so', 'much.GOOD', 'movie', 'took', 'time', 'slowly', 'ease', 'characters', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'storyline', 'let', 'get', 'know', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'wife', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'son', 'who', 'are', 'eager', 'get', 'life', 'Castle', 'last', 'mission', 'undercover', 'agent', 'Jane', 'convincing', ""'Bad"", 'guy', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'mission', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'expected', 'when', 'suspect', 'killed', 'thus', 'puts', 'motion', 'series', 'events', 'change', 'life', 'worst', 'not', 'best', 'fate', 'sake', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'entire', 'family', 'murdered', 'order', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'crime', 'lord', 'sorts', 'who', 'get', 'away', 'anything', 'Wife', 'hearing', 'death', 'youngest', 'eldest', 'son', 'suspect', 'Castle', 'last', 'mission', 'wife', 'Son', 'are', 'run', 'attempt', 'escape', 'Mad', 'Max', 'anyone', 'assailants', 'Frank', 'shot', 'square', 'chest', 'expected', 'follow', 'suit', 'rest', 'family', 'saved', 'friend', 'then', 'supposed', 'dead', 'media', 'Tampa', 'Florida', 'intent', 'deal', 'responsible', 'death', 'entire', 'family', 'life.The', 'characters', 'Castle', 'when', 'apartment', 'houses', 'only', 'three', 'people', 'A', 'woman', 'who', 'obviously', 'troubles', 'own', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'friends', 'are', 'own', 'right', 'intersting', 'Castle', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'Joan', 'friends', 'one', 'little', 'burst', 'chaos', 'door', 'one', 'day', 'lives', 'acting', 'actors/actresses', 'well', 'executed', 'John', 'Travolta', 'believable', 'villain', 'always', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'acting', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'felt', 'scenes', 'interaction', 'characters', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'decide', 'make', 'romantic', 'couple', 'be', 'neverending', 'plauge', 'movies', 'movie', 'also', 'own', 'sort', 'Humor', 'manages', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'other', 'Punisher', 'movie', 'had', 'done', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'involvement', 'police', 'department', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'spewing', 'justice', 'rather', 'Punishment', 'when', 'victims', 'violence', 'suppose', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'rated', 'R', 'not', 'top', 'unnecessarily', 'bloody', 'just', 'right.BAD', 'movie', 'slowly', 'afterwards', 'suppose', 'sake', 'keeping', 'balanced', 'action', 'interaction', 'as', 'well', 'storyline', 'most', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wondering', 'when', 'Punisher', 'will', 'Punish', 'guilty', 'movie', 'Saint', 'family', 'organization', 'wondered', 'constantly', 'wonder', 'why', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'John', 'Travolta', 'character', 'family', 'suppose', 'was', 'sake', 'giving', 'movie', 'dimension', 'however', 'became', 'little', 'matter', 'when', 'action', 'started', 'pick', 'up', 'nearing', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'grateful', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'low', 'expectations', 'managed', 'balance', 'out', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'Action', 'there', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'realistic', 'storyline', '[', '4', '5', ']']",N/A
836548,A2EJP1CB7YGPNK,B0002IQMAM,Philip B. Yochim,"[2, 3]","""The Punisher"" was one of my favorite Marvel comics. Frank Castle was a great anti-hero: a remorseless killer, but driven by a deeply ingrained sense of honor and justice. But after all these years, he still can't get a great movie.Maybe in another 20 years, things are warming up a little.This Punisher is more technically sound and staged than the first. and Tom Jane looks a little more like Frank Castle than did Dolph Lundgren. But, there's still not much feel as could be developed.On upside is a few scenes taken directly from the comics, like Mickey ""getting fried."" That's from Punisher War Zone, vol. 1. The action is pretty good, especially the big fight between Jane and the big Russian dude (though the fight ended dumb.)But on the downside, things still weren't adding up.

The first thirty minutes are boring andunoriginal.

In contrast,the 1989 low budget but far superior version started off smack in themiddle of the action with a seriously disturbed ex cop already on therampage and the reason for his decline into madness was graduallyexplained by means of flashbacks and memories form Louis Gousset Jrtrying to bring his old friend back into a sane life.

836556,AMCH34Z0KHD41,B0002IQMAM,"rawk ""rawkabilly""","[17, 28]","In 2003 I wrote a review on Amazon for the original Punisher movie from 1989. For those of you unfamilair with it, it is a one-man-army flick with Dolph Lundren. In the review, I bashed it for being terrible, unwatchable, mindless manure. Then I praised the possibilities of the forthcoming Punisher movie, which was to be released in 2004. I said that at the very least, it couldn't be any worse than the Dolph disaster.How incredibly wrong I was.I hereby retract every bad thing I said about the 1989 Punisher movie. Because compared to this, it looks like Citizen Cane.John Travolta ruins another potentially good movie, as he always does. He is like cinematic sulfuric acid, everything he touches disintergrates, and horribly so. That's scientology for you, hey, John?But Travolta is not alone in making this stink like fresh dog droppings.Everyone associated with this movie should be catapulted into a vault of enraged hornets.Because honestly, this film could have been the first adult graphic novel to big screen adaptation to work. Instead it failed in every possible way. Then SIN CITY came along and proved that such a transfer could be done. That movie worked in all the ways The Punisher failed.First of all, everything that makes the Punisher character interesting and different from other action movie goons is gone. He is younger, shrimpier and played by a boring man named Tom Jane whose acting ability makes me yearn for the range of David Duchovney.Secondly, the movie is written and directed in a childish, ADD manner, making everything in it seem purposeless (which it is).Why do they always make The Punisher an ex-cop in these movies? The comics made him a former Vietnam Vet. That worked better.Why do they make him young? In the comics he's in his late fifties, making him a more uncanny and much more interesting anti-hero.Why do they rip-off things from The Crow (the burning image of a skull on the ground, for example)?Why do they let Travolta speak when all he's gonna do is puke out lines like:  ""Maybe he died and came back to life just so we could kill him again.""? This is dialouge so poor that even ol' Dolph wouldn't touch it.This movie should go down in the big book of Hollywood abominations. Because you need'nt be a fan of the comic to know this stinks, you merely need to be someone with moderately good taste.This movie, at best, throws back to the eighties-one-man-army trip which made slugs like Dolph stars, but it fails to even be that because the action isn't very good or original or bloody ... and by all means the Dolph movie surpasses this on that level as well as others.For example, in the Dolph one his immediate family is killed. In this one every memeber of his family, dating back six generations is killed in a ridiculous attack. This over-the-top overkill goes on and on. Okay, they killed his family, we get it!!Meanwhile, in the comics, his immediate family was killed as innocent bystanders. This is more poetic when it comes to him killing ALL criminals, don't you think?But that's the fabulous comic for you. This movie is not about a vigilante, it is about an ex-cop who is getting revenge for his dead family, all three hundred of them. Which makes one ask: then how is this a Punisher movie? Well, in the last nano-second he implies that he's gonna go after all criminals now.Oh yeah, and he has a skull on his chest.This movie just barely escapes being on a level of inferiority and crappiness normaly reserved for the likes of BATTLEFIELD EARTH and HALLOWEEN 8. While not quite that bad, I must say that at least you can laugh at BATTLEFIELD EARTH's quality of bad, whereas this movie is just plain bad to the point where you can't even endure it.This is THE HULK bad, it's so bad.Burn this movie.

836558,A29R3O02O0PON4,B0002IQMAM,"Razr Maxx ""Metal Head""","[14, 16]","Well, as you may have read elsewhere here in these reviews, this Extended Cut adds back in a subplot that was totally absent from the Theatrical Cut.  Starting with the newly filmed (yes, newly filmed) animated intro that has Frank and his buddy Weeks back in Kuwait City in '91 being ambushed by Iraqi Nationalist terrorists.  The animated sequence was actually, well I guess ""shot"" against greenscreen.  The actors acted their parts (in full costume dress) while a still photographer took shots of them, and then uploaded the pics into a computer to convert them to  black and white images using software.  Like a previous reviewer said, it's ashame that this sequence wasn't shot for real.  However I can see why it wasn't as it'd would've taken quite a bit of budget to build the set for just 4 or 5 minutes worth of footage.  Of course, going on location could have cheapened it, but who knows...Anyway, on to the real film.  Well, as it turns out that his buddy Weeks apparently falls into some major gambling debt from Saint's Cuban buddy's Casino.  And to prevent Saint and his gang from killing Weeks, Weeks gives up Frank's identity from the arms deal gone bad that killed one of Saint's sons.So then, the restored footage deals with this subplot of Weeks and Frank and how Frank discovers that Weeks was the mole and how he deals with him in the end.  Does this extra footage make the movie any better?  Well, that's subjective.  I thought it did, because it helps explain some of the turmoil behind Frank's rebirth as the Punisher.  It's not on the level of the Daredevil Director's Cut as someone else mentioned, but it does add a bit of drama to the over-all story.For those wishing for more Punisher-style take-downs, you're not gonna get it here with this Extended Cut.  But if you're a completist and a Punisher fan, pick this up for this relatively low price.

That is probably why I saw it with an open mind, not have any comic reference to build on.The film stands on its own as a testament to the pitfalls of revenge, on both the ""good"" guy and the ""bad"" guy's part.  Thomas Jane plays the federal agent who runs afoul of a villainous John Travolta and both actors jump headfirst into their respective roles.Jane garners sympathy as a man who avenges the death of his entire family, including his wife and son.  He masters an ingenious plot to not only destroy his mortal enemy, John Travolta (the man behind the massacre) but drives a wedge between Travolta and his wife as well as Travolta's ""aide-de-camp.""The good performances of Jane and Travolta are matched by James Carpinello as Travolta's twin sons, Samantha Mathis as Travolta's wife, and Will Patton as Travolta's number one henchman.  Rebecca Romijn, Ben Foster, and John Pinette are wonderful as three apartment dwellers that form a bond with Jane's ""Frank Castle"" character.The body count is great as are the graphic measures that Castle takes to ""rub out"" Travolta's minions.The DVD offers viewers a chance to see an animated beginning, detailing some story elements that were not produced for the original film but gives some necessary plot information.I would probably give the DVD five stars if it had a ""how-to"" workout regimen that Jane took in order to get as buff as he is in the film.",4,The best adaptation of a Marvel comic...yet,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,1535,"['First', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'Punisher', 'comic', 'thus', 'had', 'expectations', 'going', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'release', 'probably', 'why', 'saw', 'open', 'mind', 'not', 'have', 'comic', 'reference', 'build', 'on.The', 'film', 'own', 'testament', 'pitfalls', 'revenge', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'part', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'federal', 'agent', 'who', 'afoul', 'villainous', 'John', 'Travolta', 'actors', 'jump', 'headfirst', 'respective', 'roles.Jane', 'garners', 'sympathy', 'man', 'who', 'death', 'entire', 'family', 'including', 'wife', 'son', 'ingenious', 'plot', 'not', 'only', 'destroy', 'mortal', 'enemy', 'John', 'Travolta', 'man', 'massacre', 'wedge', 'Travolta', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'Travolta', 'aide-de-camp', 'good', 'performances', 'Jane', 'Travolta', 'are', 'matched', 'James', 'Carpinello', 'Travolta', 'twin', 'sons', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'Travolta', 'wife', 'Will', 'Patton', 'Travolta', 'number', 'one', 'henchman', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'John', 'Pinette', 'are', 'wonderful', 'three', 'apartment', 'dwellers', 'form', 'bond', 'Jane', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'character.The', 'body', 'count', 'great', 'are', 'graphic', 'measures', 'Castle', 'rub', 'out', 'Travolta', 'minions.The', 'DVD', 'viewers', 'chance', 'see', 'animated', 'beginning', 'detailing', 'story', 'elements', 'were', 'not', 'produced', 'original', 'film', 'necessary', 'plot', 'information.I', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'had', 'how-to', 'regimen', 'Jane', 'took', 'order', 'get', 'as', 'buff', 'film']",N/A

836565,A7YRIAR531O83,B0002IQMAM,Rick Chen,"[10, 12]","I have never been a huge fan of the Punisher. The only comics that I have with the Punisher in it are when he appears as villian against another superhero and a few random 'war journals' that I picked up somewhere over the years. However, I have to admit that I was quite looking forward to seeing this movie. I think that for people who didn't know much about this character, it presents an interesting storyline. An ex-FBI agent who's family is killed and he takes justice into his own hands. Vigilante style. But for true comic followers, the story strays a bit too much from the Marvel origin. I find that the Marvel movies seem to change the origin of the characters from the comics without reason. For instance, the Hulk was not a result of a genetic experiment, and Daredevil was supposed to have been blinded saving a person from a car. And with the Punisher, as I recall, Frank Castle's family was killed in a house bombing. In general, this movie is not bad at all, although the storyline is quite predictable. There are a few things in the movie that don't make too much sense. Why did Punisher setup the Travolta character to make him kill his wife and best friend, when he could've just done it himself. And the method by which he set them up was just too convenient and wouldn't have worked in real life. I didn't like how the girl neighbor just falls for this stranger without even knowing him. And although I like John Travolta, his character appeared somewhat weak and wasn't a worthy adversary for the Punisher. At the end of the movie, someone pointed out to me that all these superheroes seem to have similar origins. Either something bad happened to them that made them want to fight crime, or they gained their power through some experiment gone awry. Although I wouldn't entirely agree with this statement, it got me thinking about how non-comic collectors perceive these movies. In summary, I would say that this movie is good. In following with the comic character, I would've liked to see more guns. But if you have the time, go to the theatre, sit back, and enjoy.",3,"Not Vengeance, Not Revenge....

However, fate soon intervenes in the form of a powerful money launderer, the ironically named Howard Saint, who dispatches some hit men to wipe out Frank's immediate and extended family as an act of revenge for the death of his own drug-dealing son in a sting operation in which Frank played a major part.  Now it is Frank's turn for vengeance, as he shakes off his grief and methodically plans the elimination of all those responsible for his tragedy.""The Punisher"" brings absolutely nothing new or original to this tired old rehash of ""Death Wish,"" especially when compared to Quentin Tarantino's fresh and stylish take on the subject in the recent ""Kill Bill"" films.

The film also has more unpleasant scenes than one is accustomed to in run-of-the-mill action movies, starting with the cold-blooded murder of a terrified young boy.Come to think of it, from the audience`s viewpoint, ""The Punisher"" is a pretty apt title for this movie.",2,aptly named movie,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,1450,"['Punisher', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'undercover', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'decided', 'quit', 'business', 'move', 'London', 'live', 'quiet', 'life', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'However', 'fate', 'soon', 'intervenes', 'form', 'powerful', 'money', 'launderer', 'ironically', 'named', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'who', 'hit', 'men', 'wipe', 'out', 'Frank', 'immediate', 'extended', 'family', 'act', 'revenge', 'death', 'own', 'drug-dealing', 'son', 'sting', 'operation', 'Frank', 'played', 'major', 'part', 'Now', 'Frank', 'turn', 'vengeance', 'grief', 'methodically', 'elimination', 'responsible', 'tragedy', 'Punisher', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'original', 'tired', 'old', 'rehash', 'Death', 'Wish', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'fresh', 'stylish', 'take', 'subject', 'recent', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'films', 'Frank', 'score-settling', 'clever', 'even', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'times', 'film', 'overlong', 'derivative', 'very', 'poorly', 'acted', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'sleepwalking', 'part', 'Frank', 'John', 'Travolta', 'looking', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'anywhere', 'else', 'doing', 'umpteenth', 'version', 'one-dimensional', 'clench-jawed', 'villain', 'film', 'also', 'more', 'unpleasant', 'scenes', 'one', 'accustomed', 'run-of-the-mill', 'action', 'movies', 'starting', 'cold-blooded', 'murder', 'terrified', 'young', 'boy.Come', 'think', 'audience', 's', 'viewpoint', 'Punisher', 'pretty', 'apt', 'title', 'movie']",N/A

836571,ADKA2MJQQCMTO,B0002IQMAM,Ron Sullivan,"[1, 4]","... but not by much. Man I REALLY wanted to like this too, but it's a dud.I want to start on a positive note, because it's (at least) watchable. There is SOME good in here, it's not ALL BAD. Thomas Jane, I felt, did a really good job portraying the main character. Come to think of it, I'll just throw out a blanket statement that all the acting (overall) was adequate. The special effects, especially the car that was used as Frank Castle's ride, was really creatively done and well executed. As I said before, this is watchable.Man there are a TON of issues though. Frustrating part is that EVERY PROBLEM I found with the movie was EXTREMELY FIXABLE. Let's begin ...I had reservations about the movie's South Florida location since it began filming. The way I always pictured the Punisher, I always thought of a very dark, gritty, urban setting. Bright, tropical, colorful Florida just never seemed to fit quite right to me. Unfortunately, I was right. To have Jane running around in the middle of the afternoon just looked odd. The Punisher just isn't the kind of character that would attack something in broad daylight, in the middle of the afternoon, on a crowded city street.  Rumor has it that Travolta, a Florida resident, wouldn't sign on to the movie unless it filmed close to his home.There's an issue in the beginning of the movie, after Castle's family is slaughtered, where the time-line gets a little skewed. Once Frank returned to the mainland where he was staying, we have absolutely NO IDEA how much time had passed. Which reminds me, how exactly did that witch-doctor nurse Frank back to health? Why even point that character out at all? By all rights, Frank should have been on life-support after he was left for dead. Wouldn't it serve the movie more to just have him wash up on the beach and then taken to a hospital as a 'John Doe' (a la 'Hard to Kill')? Seems to me it would have served the same purpose and helped explain his recovery a little better. I'm not even going to mention asking where all of Castle's scars went when he takes his shirt off. He should be littered with pock-marks and scars that just aren't there. That witch-doctor must really know his stuff ...There was CLEARLY a mole in the department that Frank Castle was working for. Why was this point never pursued? Castle was CLEARLY sold-out by someone, and yet (even after his ridiculous ""I'm still alive"" declaration) nobody ever readdresses the issue? Speaking of which, why even make that speech in front of police headquarters? Wouldn't that completely blow you're element of surprise? That moment raised about a dozen questions that the film never bothered to answer.I normally never notice this kind of thing, but THE SCORE WAS HORRIBLE. Every time Howard Saint's character was on the screen, I swear they played the theme of Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies. For that matter, all the villains were nothing more then mobster card-board cut-outs.As far as the villains go, aside from Saint, they were all cartoons. The hit-man from Memphis and his musical interlude? What was with that? It did nothing to forward the plot at all. You could have completely cut him from the movie, maybe saved it for the DVD and lower the movie's running time by about 15 minutes. The Russian also looked like a character out of a Street Fighter video game.As far as the action, Lion's Gate was obviously pulling its punches. The Punisher is a BRUTAL CHARACTER; it was almost comedic watching him meticulously setting up these elaborate traps for Saints goons to fall into or trying to torture an enemy with a popsicle. Does anyone really think they wouldn't know the difference between a freeze-pop and a blowtorch?  I wanted so badly for this film to be a throwback to the mid-eighties action movies, the Punisher's supposed to be 'Rambo' not 'The Count of Monte Cristo.'It just seems to me that the idea of who this character is and what drives him was totally lost by the end of the movie. It's a little better then the Dolph Lungren movie; but they still haven't gotten it right either.

836575,A1RA1035L09OA1,B0002IQMAM,Ryno,"[0, 1]","I'll be frank with you. The Spiderman movie was just a bit too childish and goofy for me with all the costumes and plastic masks all the actors sported. The plot was just foolish and pointless on top of that. I never even bothered to see The Hulk because c'mon, Jolly Green Giant in his own starring role? Nor did I bother flushing my money away with Daredevil, due to the trailers that displayed the outrageous plastic costumes, and the bad guys with targets on their foreheads.Now with The Punisher. I was surprised, I must admit, because before going to see this movie--yes I actually saw this movie unlike the other reviews PREDICTING the film's successes/failures-- I was disappointed to see in the beginning credits that it was made in association with Marvel Comics, thinking this was going to be another cheesy comic book adaptation. On the contrary my dear friends. Interesting plot setup for extreme revenge on the part of bad guys and the good guys (equals double the action) makes it packed to the rim with excitement.I like the somewhat ""realistic"", well let me put this a different way, ""extremely rare and very remotely possible"" plot (c'mon, that's what makes movies different from real life) this movie creates, making the transformation from the comicbook hero into ""reality"" very easy to digest.I must make another confession that I've never heard of this Punisher character before in my life until seeing the movie, so I can't tell you how accurate the character portrayal in the movie is compared to the comicbook character. All I can say is that the only slight indication that he is from a comic book is that he wears that black and white skull shirt (but probably only 2 or 3 times). And no, sorry, the shirt doesn't make him fly or give him x-ray vision. It is just a gift that his son gave him that supposedly warded off spirits or some goofy thing like that (you know kids will believe anything). During the movie, the shirt doesnt do any of that sort of nonsense, just more or less gives him protection from harmful UV rays thanks to the cotton material it's made of, also known as the fabric of our lives.Check this movie out.

Fortunately this version is a bit better done than the other, but it is still a marginal movie at best.  When the lead character played by Tom Jane is not getting the crap beat out of him, he is delivering uninspired dialog in a wooden fashion.

836580,A2QAUMR0V33GC9,B0002IQMAM,"Scot Carr ""Film and book phanatic""","[5, 6]","The two versions (yes, rerelease...blahblahblah...waste of our money to make more studio profit....blahblahblah...sorry, I HAD to say it in some form) of this particular adaptation do a great job in showing us the demons that haunt Frank Castle.  They do an adiquite (sp?) job in showing us the ambiguous nature of his quest (which ranks right up there with Travis Bickle as who-do-you-root-for? characters), and they make Frank a sympathetic character.  Someone you can almost (but not quite) excuse for his harsh brand of justice.And herein lies the problem - the Punisher, as envisioned in recent Marvel series featuring him, isn't a hero.  What he is is a sick man, a serial killer hell-bent on slaughtering as many humans as possible with only him being judge as to whether the victims were deserving of death.  On a karmic scale, he only rates higher than aformentioned serial killers or blitz killers because he DOES target scum.  As of right now (thanks to the firstly hilarious, now downright serious penning of Garth Ennis), the Punisher is one of the least heroic ""heroes"" in the Marvel pantheon, and instead of showing us THAT part of Castle's psyche, we get the homogenized, almost-justified version, a clear example of Hollywood not having guts enough to show us moral ambiguity for fear of cutting into mass profit.Having said this, however, with the extended cut, as in ""Daredevil,"" we get to see an excised plotpoint that would've given us another view, and not a very nice one, of poor deluded Frank.  What we should've seen in the first cut of the movie, and we finally get to see here, is Frank forcing a man who'd been his best friend to commit suicide because the man had betrayed him.  Does Willis deserve death?  Maybe.  But who made Frank the judge?  A man so obviously, justifyably, addled by the slaughter of his family.  THIS is what we should see of the Punisher character - a superskilled Travis Bickle quite able to do what he does well, but leaving us to wonder if he should?Having said this, however, the movies - both cuts - deserve to be on any superhero movie collector's shelf because director-writer Hansleigh doesn't chicken out as much as the corporate puppetmasters did.  He GETS the character, thus pushes the maximum out of Thomas Jane, who also gets it.  They both do justice to this rather rich figure of the comic book world and do as much as they're allowed to do to show his ambiguity, his illness, and his tortured soul.The movie also has a very gritty, real-world feel.  This is important because the Punisher was never a man of the glittery super-hero world.  His isn't the glamorus high-tech team existance, nor does he crave acceptance.  In this film, as in the comic book, Frank knows he's outside what anyone normal considers moral and legal behavior.  He doesn't love what he does.  The only higher call he feels out of it is the satisfaction of one more bad guy off the streets forever.  Jane's interpretation mirrors this - He no longer feels gentle emotions.  He no longer ALLOWS himself to feel gentle emotions.  He can never have a normal life again.  He must do what he does simply because there's no one else to do it.While I like John Travolta, and his Howard Saint harkens back to the interesting villain he played in ""Pulp Fiction,"" his character simply isn't as interesting as Castle.  He plays him as a whacked-out sadist pretending to live as normal, but there's no ambiguity from him beyond this.  We KNOW he's evil, and we're quite glad when Frank kills him - his whole screwy family as well.And maybe this is why the extended cut is the most fascinating.  We're allowed to, at least a little, feel the uneasiness of Frank Castle.  A once-good man, perhaps a good man still underneath his psycopathy, but one we know is destroyed a little more for doing what he must to the Howard Saints of the world.By the way, I do recommend, if you're only going to buy one (and, if, *sigh*, like me, you buy both, either get one of 'em used or heavily discounted), to get the theatrical release.  There's more behind-the-scenes goodness that shows how they were able to get such a slick movie for so relatively little budget.  The extended cut, though, IS the story that should've been told the first time.",4,"""I Can Hear What You're Thinkin'.....""

836581,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B0002IQMAM,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[1, 2]","A strange take on the Marvel comic of the same name.  Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) in the comics is at a picnic when his family overhears some gangland stuff going on and promptly get murdered.  Perhaps a wife, a few kids.The film thinks bigger.  We have Castle retiring.  Just before he does, he gets involved in a sting where the son of a gangster (John Travolta) gets himself killed.  Travolta's character does some research and finds that Castle was the disguised sting operator.  The wife insists that Castle's entire family gets wasted.  That's the entire two clans of the family reunion in Puerto Rico.About 30 people are killed.  A bit overkill, huh?Thomas Jane plays the role in a bit of a subdued tone rather than an angry vengeful tone.  And in some scenes this works.  The Punisher, just like in Elektra, does not do well in hand to hand combat.  He gets punched, beat, and is wiped along the floor and smashed into concrete floors and walls.  He beats The Russian by throwing hot soup in his face.OK, now I'm scared.The film tries to be lighthearted with the family he lives nearby as neighbors.  They look at Frank as family.  The slapstick became a bit much.  And if some guy is pulling your lip rings out with a pair of pliers, you really are not going to say anything about the whereabouts of Castle?  And the little fat friend who sits with a smarmy grin on his face does not make a move or say a word as the kid gets his rings pulled out.  Geesh....Some slapstick as well, comes off fake.Strange -- why does it take so long for the gang to know where Frank lives?  His face was on every TV set in the city and people would point and say, ""Hey, I know you!""  Yet half the film is over before they decide to go to his apartment.The Punisher does punish --especially towards the end of the film where we see he's pretty good setting up booby traps and creating false evidence, tricking Travolta's character into killing his own associates and wife.  Clever.Blowing up every single car in a parking lot was, again, overkill.  I mean, really.  Travolta does not do ""bad guy"" so well.  Similar to his portrayal in ""Broken Arrow"", I just don't see him as evil.  Saturday Night Fever was not happening here!I don't want to list every fallacy in this film.  I will say some parts were fairly gruesome and sad, the pyrotechnics were loud and unnecessary and the acting was hampered by a script that didn't know where it wanted to go.And, no Stan Lee walk-on!Recommended for die-hard fans who want to see a movie loosely based on the Punisher comics series.

A seasoned comic book fan, my knees trembled with anticipation when first I heard of a Punisher movie.  A tiny thread of doubt crept upon me when I learned that Thomas Jane would be playing our tortured hero.  And upon hearing negative reviews from nearly all of my close(well comic-versed) friends, I didn't even see the Punisher on the big screen.  But it came out on DVD today and I bought it--a necessary part of my collection even if it lacked a bit.  No disappointment here.  As usual, John Travolta is a convincing and well-studied villian with sincere emotions.  Overall, the acting is quite superb; including Tom Jane who dove into the role whole-heartedly and captured the Frank C. that we have grown to adore in our comic reading.  A side note, if you don't read the comic, you should.  As previously noted by another reviewed, it does stay close to the comic storyline which all of us fanboys and girls will appreciate.  Even if you dont' follow the comic, it's an excellent action movie with some tremendous fight scenes both physical and with guns and various other machinery.  And somewhere in the story of a vigilant who seeks justice after the brutal murder of his entire family, the director and writers manage to punch up a few light-hearted moments to ease the mood a bit.

Lurking somewhere beneath Jonathan Hensleigh's oddly stilted rendition of ""The Punisher"" is an excellent movie waiting to be made. The leads are good. Thomas Jane makes an appealing Punisher, letting his chest do most of work (and what a mighty fine chest it is - the story of Jane's offset physical transformation is even more compelling than the movie) and John Travolta rolls out his familiar twitchy villain routine that somehow never gets tired. There's action aplenty, with loads of gun-play, several high-res maimings, a few gruesome deaths and the odd hot chick: more than enough to keep half the film's key demographic - teen boys with fantasies of steroidal revenge - quite happy. What about the other half, the comic book devotees? Hensleigh's screenplay is reasonable. The problem is that his movie falls into the trap that captures many in the genre. It isn't that they don't respect the source, it's that they don't seem to understand it. Comic books are melodramatic, as are their heroes - broken men with tragic pasts, most of their quests play out like some kind of violently enacted therapy. It works on the page because we come to the medium with the built-in expectation that melodrama is what we're getting. But on screen, this kind of setup feels false unless the production design and direction are given a similarly melodramatic pitch. Hensleigh makes the fatal error of going for a gritty, realistic look and feel that plays against the unreality of the story, with the effect that they cancel each other out. To date, only Tim Burton seems to have understood how to make this kind of movie. Of all the comic book adaptations, only his ""Batman"" ever really succeeded, and it did so because Burton had the nerve to go all the way - to take not only the story, but the performances and production design way over the top. He showed Hollywood how to make this kind of movie fifteen years ago.

Thus, I probably am missing alot of what's great about this movie.That said, viewing this as just a regular movie, this was quite horrible.  The acting was very stiff and unbelievable.  The pacing was overly slow - not the intentional, tension building slowness of Unbreakables, but just a real dragging pace that made one think the director didn't know when to cut the scenes.  Additionally, the whole wind-up of the movie (the popular guy in the FBI retires, his family is sick of moving, they are going to live like normal people now, yada yada yada), was WAY to cliche and also took much too long.The one somewhat amusing aspect was the Punisher's neighbors in their seedy apartment building.  In some way, even that was conventional.  And yet, there was a real, human glimpse at these characters' lives that was strikingly refreshing and enjoyable.All told, about a half hour before the end of the movie, we had an interruption.

836597,A3PCIH7XDZGLHL,B0002IQMAM,TheFracturedCritic,"[0, 2]","Hollywood cinema tends to go through fad after fad after fad. Whether it's an onslaught of perverted teen comedies, cheesy horror movies for the faint of heart or corny chick flicks with the same script and just different actors, they tend to wear themselves out beyond their welcome so Hollywood will move onto a new fad. Ever since Spiderman swung into the box office Hollywood has decided that superheroes would be the new big screen thing. So now it seems that superhero after superhero is finding his or her way onto the screen (even the less know ones such as Hellboy).Obviously the American public has taken to superheroes so it only seems right that Hollywood pump out another one, so we are given The Punisher. A little bit of background info: Frank Castle is an FBI agent who has decided to quit due to lack of time for his family and the potential of putting them in danger. He pulls one last job which (try and catch this ball hit into left field) has gone unexpectedly wrong. A young man, who was not supposed to be there, is shot down in the course of the undercover operation along with numerous other people who were there. The young man, however, is the son of Howard Saint, a rich tycoon who has his hand in crime. Wanting vengance for his son's death, Howard, in occardance of his wife, orders all of Frank Castle's family to be killed. So they are....except Frank who miraculously survives a bullet at point blank range to the chest and an explosion. After being nursed to health Frank takes up house in an apartment and sets out to exact his revenge on Howard and everyone tied to him. Along the way he meets a few allies but mainly keeps to himself as he takes down Howard's crew one by one.So since The Punisher has a comic book series of his own does that automatically make him a superhero? Well what superpowers does he have? He can get beat beyond all recognition and still save the day and he can hold a lot of weapons at once. Superhero or no superhero Frank means business and he uses the abilities bestowed upon him to get it. Now how accurately his methods are to that of the comic series I'm not sure (I was never big into comics) so I can only base the movie on its own merit.I never credited Thomas Jane with being a great actor and his role of Frank Castle/The Punisher doesn't raise him a notch in my book. However I have seen the better side of John Travolta and I was somewhat disapointed in his portrayal of the villain in this movie because I've seen him do it so well. It's like he decided to take a break from trying and just kind of lay back for this one. The rest of the characters don't leave any lasting impressions in their roles so it's somewhat hard to get into loving/hating characters until later on in the movie.So how does The Punisher stand as far as being a 'revenge' movie? Well he kills people unmercifully so that automatically qualifies it.  There's not much here as far as actions scenes go to make it a bright shining light in the genre but it does have some clever moments. Instead of straight up shooting some of the main 'villians', Castle uses his intellect and plays with Howard's mind through a nice set of tricks he has cooked up. This makes for an interesting touch and shows a much more intelligent side to our hero than posed in most revenge movies.The few scenes of clever intelligence and a nice final death scene don't save this film as it suffers from multiple things (lack of character depth, severe boredom in some scenes, a poorly acted script, done over action scenes and just kind of dumb at some points). While The Punisher is probably worth a rent if you've got nothing better to do and does make you somewhat impressed at certain points it still leaves you wanting more. I give The Punisher a 5 out of 10 (or 3 stars).",3,The Punisher,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,3802,"['Hollywood', 'cinema', 'go', 'fad', 'fad', 'fad', 'onslaught', 'perverted', 'teen', 'comedies', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'movies', 'faint', 'heart', 'corny', 'chick', 'flicks', 'same', 'script', 'just', 'different', 'actors', 'tend', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'so', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'move', 'new', 'fad', 'Ever', 'Spiderman', 'swung', 'box', 'office', 'Hollywood', 'decided', 'superheroes', 'would', 'be', 'new', 'big', 'screen', 'thing', 'So', 'now', 'superhero', 'superhero', 'finding', 'way', 'screen', 'even', 'less', 'know', 'ones', 'such', 'Hellboy', '.Obviously', 'American', 'public', 'taken', 'superheroes', 'only', 'right', 'Hollywood', 'pump', 'out', 'one', 'are', 'given', 'Punisher', 'little', 'bit', 'background', 'info', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'decided', 'quit', 'due', 'lack', 'time', 'family', 'potential', 'putting', 'danger', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'try', 'catch', 'ball', 'hit', 'left', 'field', 'gone', 'unexpectedly', 'wrong', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'there', 'shot', 'down', 'course', 'undercover', 'operation', 'numerous', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'young', 'man', 'however', 'son', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'rich', 'tycoon', 'who', 'hand', 'crime', 'Wanting', 'vengance', 'son', 'death', 'Howard', 'occardance', 'wife', 'orders', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'family', 'be', 'killed', 'are', 'Frank', 'who', 'miraculously', 'bullet', 'point', 'blank', 'range', 'chest', 'explosion', 'being', 'nursed', 'health', 'Frank', 'up', 'house', 'apartment', 'out', 'exact', 'revenge', 'Howard', 'everyone', 'tied', 'way', 'few', 'allies', 'mainly', 'down', 'Howard', 'crew', 'one', 'one.So', 'Punisher', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'own', 'automatically', 'make', 'superhero', 'Well', 'what', 'have', 'can', 'get', 'beat', 'recognition', 'still', 'save', 'day', 'can', 'hold', 'lot', 'weapons', 'once', 'Superhero', 'superhero', 'Frank', 'business', 'abilities', 'bestowed', 'get', 'Now', 'how', 'accurately', 'methods', 'are', 'comic', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'comics', 'can', 'only', 'base', 'movie', 'own', 'merit.I', 'never', 'credited', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'being', 'great', 'actor', 'role', 'Frank', 'Castle/The', 'Punisher', ""n't"", 'raise', 'notch', 'book', 'However', 'have', 'seen', 'better', 'side', 'John', 'Travolta', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disapointed', 'portrayal', 'villain', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'decided', 'take', 'break', 'trying', 'just', 'kind', 'lay', 'back', 'one', 'rest', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'lasting', 'impressions', 'roles', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'get', 'loving/hating', 'characters', 'later', 'movie.So', 'how', 'Punisher', 'stand', 'as', 'far', 'being', ""'revenge"", 'movie', 'Well', 'people', 'unmercifully', 'so', 'automatically', 'not', 'much', 'here', 'as', 'far', 'actions', 'scenes', 'go', 'make', 'bright', 'shining', 'light', 'genre', 'have', 'clever', 'moments', 'Instead', 'straight', 'up', 'shooting', 'main', ""'villians"", 'Castle', 'intellect', 'plays', 'Howard', 'mind', 'nice', 'set', 'tricks', 'cooked', 'up', 'interesting', 'touch', 'much', 'more', 'intelligent', 'side', 'hero', 'posed', 'most', 'revenge', 'movies.The', 'few', 'scenes', 'clever', 'intelligence', 'nice', 'final', 'death', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'multiple', 'things', 'lack', 'character', 'depth', 'severe', 'boredom', 'scenes', 'poorly', 'acted', 'script', 'done', 'action', 'scenes', 'just', 'kind', 'dumb', 'points', 'Punisher', 'probably', 'rent', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'make', 'somewhat', 'impressed', 'certain', 'points', 'still', 'wanting', 'more', 'give', 'Punisher', '5', '10', '3', 'stars']",N/A

Not as great as ""Spider-Man"" & not as horrorifically suck-ass as ""The Hulk"", ""The Punisher"" is above average comic book storytelling sandwiched (in ranking) between ""Daredevil"" and the current release of ""Hellboy"".Frank Castle is a freshly retired F.B.I. agent, who's last job got a little messy. Trying to capture two young armsbuyers, Castle poses himself off as a Russian dealer but the deal goes wrong as the local cops show up shooting one of the buyers, during the arrest process. The dead buyer is the son of Howard Saint, the local Mob boss. Saint wants and gets all the information on the Russian dealer, who naturally turns out to be Castle. Saint orders, not only the assassination of Castle, but, the extermination of his entire family & as luck would have it, Castle returns to his family, hosting a family reunion (Castle is moving his family to London for safety sake). The reunion hits a dead end as Frank Castle watches, at the hands of Saint's oldest son and his hit crew, the entire evaporation of his family (including his father, mother, and all in-laws & relatives). Castle survives and vowes to rid the world of Howard Saint, his finances, and both of his families.In the original comic book, Frank Castle was a Vietnam Vet., back from the war and happy to be home with his family. That happiness is short lived when Frank watches his family get gunned down in the crossfire of a Mob hit (classic case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time). Its then, of course, that Frank Castle becomes ""The Punisher"", waging a one man war against the New York Crime Syndicate.As for the film, it doesn't take place in New York, but in Tampa, Florida (the one bump in the road for this film). The cast is pretty decent. Seeing Travolta as a bad guy again is always a bonus (I miss Vincent Vega!). Thomas Jane was a great choice as Frank Castle, bringing humility and vengence to the role. I felt that Rebecca Romijn was a little too much as the next door neighbor (she's too much of a hottie to be living in a building like that) but pulls off a fair portrayal as the waitress.The action scenes were really quite original and cool. The battle between the Dolph Lundgren russian (played by an unrecognizable Kevin Nash) was worth the price of admission, as well as, the shootout / knifefight between a Johnny Cash style hitman (he sings a song to his target before killing them) and ""The Punisher"" was a laugh riot (""What kind of a**hole brings a knife to a gunfight?!?"" asks the hitman.

836599,A1A6SYE407PMKN,B0002IQMAM,THE SIX DOLLAR MAN,"[1, 2]","The Good - The fight with the russian, Frank Castles neighbors are straight from a comic storyline, Tom Jane does a good job portraying the Punisher charactor and it was nice to see Roy Schieder working again even though his appearance was brief.The Bad - The origin took to long to establish the charactors motivation and get action rolling. Speaking of action, I didn't think there was enough of it (the exception being the fight with the russian.) Explosions from a remote control establish the Punisher as a thinking hero, but for me were not as visually saticfying as good ol' kung fu or an over the top gun fight. Oh yeah, he also lit a fire that forms the image of the Punisher logo.I went to see this in the Theatre ( I am a fan of the Punisher comic ) with a group of friends and the general concensus was that the part of the group completely unfamiliar with the charactor really liked it(chics included) and the Punisher fans didn't think it was violent enough. I thought alot of the other reviewers rated this movie way to high, but keep in mind, my review of this movie is in the minority. Personally I liked the Dolph Lundgren movie more. The first Punisher (straight to video just like Citizen Kane!) was cheesy , yet the action moved so fast you didn't have to think about the script.I would like to see a sequel because I did like Tom Janes focused portrayal of Frank Castle.

836601,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0002IQMAM,Tim Janson,"[3, 3]","Was it a masterpiece?  No.  But the Punisher did a good job of being exactly what it wanted to be:  A solid action movie.I think the problem lies in with the character itself.  In the late 80's and early 90's the Punisher was one of Marvel's top characters.  He starred in three of his own monthly titles.  A rare honor that previously had been reserved only for Spiderman and the X-men. Yet still, he was a realatively unknown character to the general populace.The Punisher is an anti-hero and I think the violence perhaps put critics off thinking maybe he was a vigilante in the vein of Batman.The plot is well known.  Frank Castle is a just retired FBI operative.  In his last bust the son of a Miami mobster, Howard Saint. (played well by John Travolta) is killed and he seeks revenge by Killing Castles entire family at a reunion in Puerto Rico.Castle survives his wounds and then seeks out first to destroy Saint's organization and then Saint and his cronies themselves.Thomas Jane I thought did a good job in understating his role.  The Punisher is NOT a fun guy.  He's a bit morose and very intense.  Jane was able to display both of these characteristics very well as the grieving husband and father an the hell-bent for revenge Punisher.Travolta's character and his henchmen are pretty two-dimensional and standard villains but that's ok.  We really don't want to see much development with guys we know are going to end up dead anyway, do we?I was glad to see the film-makers did not give into the urge and have Castle go the romantic route with neighbor Rebecca Romijn Stamos.  The comic character would never let himself get emotionally involved with anyone.The action sequences are done quite well.  My only beef would be perhaps it is a bit too comic-bookish with some of the villians such as the singing hitman from Memphis, and the big Russian played by pro wrestler Kevin Nash.I think these comic-type villians detracted a bit from the edginess of the movie.The DVD has some great extras including commentary, making of doumantery, features on the stunts and even a punisher mini-comic.",4,BETTER THAN THE CRITICS SAY,1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,2103,"['Was', 'masterpiece', 'No', 'Punisher', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'solid', 'action', 'movie.I', 'think', 'problem', 'character', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'Punisher', 'was', 'one', 'Marvel', 'top', 'characters', 'starred', 'three', 'own', 'monthly', 'titles', 'rare', 'honor', 'previously', 'had', 'been', 'reserved', 'only', 'Spiderman', 'X-men', 'still', 'was', 'realatively', 'unknown', 'character', 'general', 'populace.The', 'Punisher', 'anti-hero', 'think', 'violence', 'perhaps', 'put', 'critics', 'off', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'was', 'vigilante', 'vein', 'Batman.The', 'plot', 'well', 'known', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'just', 'retired', 'FBI', 'operative', 'last', 'bust', 'son', 'Miami', 'mobster', 'Howard', 'Saint', 'played', 'well', 'John', 'Travolta', 'killed', 'revenge', 'Killing', 'Castles', 'entire', 'family', 'reunion', 'Puerto', 'Rico.Castle', 'wounds', 'then', 'out', 'first', 'destroy', 'Saint', 'organization', 'then', 'Saint', 'cronies', 'themselves.Thomas', 'Jane', 'thought', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'understating', 'role', 'Punisher', 'NOT', 'fun', 'guy', 'bit', 'morose', 'very', 'intense', 'Jane', 'was', 'able', 'display', 'characteristics', 'very', 'well', 'grieving', 'husband', 'father', 'hell-bent', 'revenge', 'Punisher.Travolta', 'character', 'henchmen', 'are', 'pretty', 'two-dimensional', 'standard', 'villains', 'ok.', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'much', 'development', 'guys', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'anyway', 'do', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'film-makers', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'urge', 'have', 'Castle', 'go', 'romantic', 'route', 'neighbor', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn', 'Stamos', 'comic', 'character', 'would', 'never', 'let', 'get', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'anyone.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'only', 'beef', 'would', 'be', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'comic-bookish', 'villians', 'such', 'singing', 'hitman', 'Memphis', 'big', 'Russian', 'played', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'Kevin', 'Nash.I', 'think', 'comic-type', 'villians', 'detracted', 'bit', 'edginess', 'movie.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'extras', 'including', 'commentary', 'making', 'doumantery', 'features', 'stunts', 'even', 'punisher', 'mini-comic']",N/A
836602,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,B0002IQMAM,Timothy Michael Resh,"[4, 12]","First, I am a huge fan of the numerous Marvel and DC characters that have been brought to the screen in recent years.  With a few exceptions, most have been very well done and the franchises have been well managed.  Not this one.  The film is one part camp, one part action, and one part cheesy dialogue.  All of the above combine to make The Punisher the worst film I have seen in a long time.Perhaps my expectations were too high.  I expected a dark, gritty tale of a man hellbent on avenging his murdered family.  Instead of being consumed by vengeance, the director elects to play up the alcoholism angle, which, while understandable in the circumstances, is not how I perceive the Punisher.  Further lightening the mood are Castle's hapless misfit neighbors, who are such one-dimensional caricatures that I nearly expected them to disappear when they turned sideways.  Alas, that might have actually improved their contribution to the picture.  Along these same lines, John Travolta plays a merciless, ruthless crimelord whose total lack of redeeming qualities make the character downright painful to watch.The lone bright spots in the film are the ever-beautiful Rebecca Romjin ( who befriends Castle and adds a welcome contrast to the empty-headed female presence of Laura Harring as Travolta's vindictive wife) and Will Patton as Travolta's second-in-command who harbors a little secret that I will not spoil here for anyone who has not yet seen the film.  Not that I recommend that anyone subject themselves to this.It is sad to think that Dolph Lundgren could actually turn in a more convincing performance at anything, but he did in his late-80s adaptation of the Punisher story, which at least had the added attraction of Lou Gossett, Jr. to give it some cred.This is an absolute stinkbomb of a film.  I kept watching, thinking that the senseless waste of human life being depicted couldn't grow worse, and yet it did, right up to the final scenes.  All I can say is, Avi Arad, what were you thinking?  With brilliant and much more sophisticated Marvel adaptations of X-Men and Spider Man, and reboots of the Batman and Superman franchises on the other side of the superhero universe, there are much better choices out there for superhero fans than this total waste of time.

After the first half hour though, that's gone and replaced with the typical unrealistic bull s***. This film also couldn't decide whether or not it wanted to be PG-13 or R. Ultimately it got the R rating and has the violence that goes with it, but clearly the producers were hoping for the PG-13, and have some really childish parts to it. I hate when that happens, make up your mind! If you're going to be violent and crazy, then go all out, and if not, tone it down and get the PG-13.

836610,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002IQMAM,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","In spite of the fact that 'The Punisher' is based on Marvel Comic character, it is nothing like 'Spider-man.'  The hero of 'The Punisher' is no superhero; he has no superpower to rely on during the fighting, and it is his dark background that distingushed him from others.The hero is Frank Castle. an FBI man who wants to retire.  Because of one botched job, however, a son of shady Florida businessman got killed, and his father (John Travolta) and his wife (Laura Harring) vow revenge.  Actually, it is the wife who orders that Frank and his family should be all murdered (and convieniently, they are having a home party.  Don't complain, for the director Jonathan Hensleigh is the writer of 'Die Hard 3'and 'Armageddon').So, Frank, the sole survivor of the carnage, starts to his own vendetta while he gradually comes to know the timid neighbors in his apartment (as is shown in the original comics).  While secretly making his own plans for revenge (and very unusual ones), Frank is attacked by many curious killers; one guy from Memphis plays guitar before his job, and the unique fight with 'The Russian' is one of the highlights of the film.'The Punisher' often suggests violence, but refuses to show it on the screen, so the results might not be satisfactory to some viewers, being too tame, or too nasty.  But the action sequences, which include more bone-crunching sort of fihting than other Marvel comic films, are effectively shot, and Thomas Jane (credited as Tom Jane) has the convincing presence as the anti-hero, partly thanks to his pumped-up torso.As to Travola, he is not as irritating as in 'Swordfish' -- he is not that bad, but still I think he lacks the charisma he had shown in 'Vincent' of 'Pulp Fiction.'  And though Will Patton steals the scene as the assistant of Travolta, the guests are not particularly great, including Roy Scheider, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos.  And it is painful to see Samantha Mathis doing a very thankless job clearly for paycheck -- she was so good in the early 90s, and what is she doing here?'The Punisher' is just another standard Hollywood action film with no new thing to add to the genre.

That's how I feel having just watched ""The Punisher"".  G-R-I-M is the word to describe this movie.  This would be OK if the revenge part of it was compelling, but unfortunately ""The Punisher"" fails in this area too.The movie never recovers from its first act, and specifically the scene where the title charatcer's family is murdered.  Not only is it an ugly scene to sit through, but it also mercilessly lingers on, as a truck chases and mowes over people pathetically trying to flee.  After watching this, you want The Punisher to just destroy everyone that was involved.  Unfortunately, this is where the movie fails big time.Most of the villains do get their inevitable comeuppances, but it's not really satisfying.  At least two of the villains' ends are so pathetic that I just wanted to scream at the filmakers.  The big mistake is having The Punisher exact is vengeance in a round-about way, by sowing seeds of suspicion between the villains and having them kill each other.  This is somewhat interesting, but also very sloppily done, and unfortunately denies the audience what could have been some great action scenes.  There is some action here, but not nearly enough, and at two hours the film seems to drag on forever.John Travolta is simply not captivating as the villain.  I suppose his performance is adequate, but his character's not nearly despicable enough.  His worst action in the movie- killing The Punisher's family- is not even directly ordered by him.  To make it worse, he lets The Punisher manipulate him like a puppet, making him more pathetic than menacing.My final complaint is the movie's tone.  It's all so grimy, dark, and depressing.  Since the movie's main plot fails to be captivating, this makes it a chore to sit through (in this way, the best comparison to a modern comic book movie is ""Daredevil"").  The first two ""Batman"" films and the unfairly bashed ""Hulk"" movie may have been downbeat, but they were vibrant, colorful films with terrific action sequences.  ""The Punisher"" takes place almost exclusively at night, and very few action sequences manage to raise the pulse, making the whole affair just downright depressing.""The Punisher"" is not a bad movie- the acting is overall good, and there was definite potential- but it simply is not one I can recommend.

The Dolph Lundgren version betrayed the original character a bit and lost the some of the key points from the comics that made Frank Castle.  As far as the vigilantes go, Punisher is up there with Blade and above Johnson's Daredevil and Ghost Rider.As for the movie itself, this is a great action movie with a unique story set up with great characters.  Thomas Jane does a great job overall, although some lines throughout the film are a little campy.  Travolta was highly criticized for his role, but I can't see why they chose to bash him.  Travolta did a fine job at playing the villain.  The neighbors Dave, Joan, and Bumpo are a decent addition to the film, unlike sidekick characters that are squeezed into other action films played by Shia LeBeouf.  Most of the time I can't stand the comic relief in action films, but Ben Foster did a great job with this character.  His performance was much better than Angel in X-Men3.  Apart from Thomas Jane I would say that Will Patton (Quentin Glass) did a great justice to this film.  He really took this role seriously and did a fantastic job.  The film also has an excellent score.  For a brutal action movie it was really nice to hear a really well thought musical score.The extended version really doesn't have that much to offer.  The Kill-Bill-esque animated scene is neat but still not needed.  It was also a better idea to take Jimmy Week's story out of the final cut.  It was an interesting side-plot but the gruesome ending to it just made you hate the Punisher.  The Russian fight scene was apparently extended but I saw no difference from the original.Bottom Line: Your not gonna miss the great parts of the Punisher if you don't buy the extended cut.  Spider-man 2.1 and Daredevil(Extended) serve as much better extended versions.  The Punisher is a great movie, don't get me wrong, but it didn't really need to come out with another version.

836616,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B0002IQMAM,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[0, 0]","The second Marvel Comics movie about their anti-heroic creation ""The Punisher"" harkens back to those popular Charles Bronson vigilante thrillers from the 1970s.  This straightforward, old-fashioned, formulaic, but utterly suspenseful revenge epic looks pretty realistic compared to the usual action-oriented Hollywood pulp blown far out of proportion by special effects ad nauseam.  You know the kind of movie I am referring to with blood squibs exploding like tomatoes, bullets flying in lead swarms like locust, and profanity galore.  ""GoldenEye"" scribe Michael France and writer-turned-helmer Jonathan Hensleigh have loaded a lot of wit into this otherwise nondescript, down-to-earth, kill or be killed payback parable.  Delete the white skull T-shirt scene and the parking lot shot, and you'd never guess that this shoot'em up was based on the thirty year Marvel Comic protagonist who appeared initially in 1974 as a ""Spider-man"" nemesis.  Hensleigh states on ""The Punisher"" DVD commentary track that Sam Peckinpah, Don Siegel, and Sergio Leone inspired him.  He points out also that France and he derived their material primarily from the Garth Ennis ""Punisher"" from 2001 ""Welcome Back, Frank.""  Like the Dolph Lundgren ""Punisher,"" this one ignores the protagonist's ""Spider-man"" origins.Indeed, ""The Punisher"" so singles out its objectives that anything beyond the hero's grim retribution appears disposable.  The supporting cast in the apartment section of the film gives the story most of its humor than its haunted, hard-drinking, stoic hero.  Nevertheless, ""The Punisher"" ripples with considerable imagination for a hardcore, balls-to-the-wall actioneer.  Our obsessive champion lives only to savor the moments when he can settle a score in blood and he can see no farther than the next target on his hit-list.  After he wipes out the opposition, Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) thrusts a gun down his gullet.  Without his wife and young son, Frank finds no meaning in life.Conversely, ""The Punisher"" doesn't drum up those anti-social sentiments.  Hensleigh portrays a lot of shooting, stabbing, and killing, but he doesn't celebrate the hero's violence behavior.  ""The Punisher"" shows the consequences of violence.  Death and killing alter both people and events.  Second string tough guy Thomas Jane, so wonderful in ""Stander,"" makes his bid for the big-screen as the eponymous character and succeeds for my money.  Jane spends the bulk of ""The Punisher"" baring his Bo-Flex physique when he isn't braving a gauntlet of obstacles that would stagger ordinary mortals.Hardcore ""Punisher"" fans may quibble about some of the alterations in the comic book's transition from page to screen.  Our redoubtable hero Frank Castle is working undercover for the FBI where we first meet him in Tampa, Florida.  An FBI agent rather than a U.S. Marine (watch the extended version), Castle poses as a ""Stander"" type Euro arms dealer selling contraband weapons to a small fry Mafia solder, Mickey Duka (Eddie Jemison), an errand boy for notorious Saint crime family.The major complication is that one of Saint's sons; Bobby (newcomer James Carpinello in a dual role) decides to cut himself in on one of his soldier's deals and accompanies Mickey to the buy.  Unfortunately, poor Bobby Saint takes one for the team during a shoot-out after the authorities stage the bogus death of one of their undercover operatives.  Predictably, Howard Saint is not amused.  Saint's trophy wife Livia (Hispanic actress Laura Harring of ""John Q"") demands reprisal.  Eventually, Saint's resourceful, right-hand henchman, Quentin Glass (the vastly underrated Will Patton of ""The Rapture"") learns that Saint's son died in an FBI sting.In no time, Saint sends Glass and an army of gunsels to wipe out the Castle clan, including Frank's father, Frank the Elder, (Roy Schneider of ""The French Connection"" and ""Jaws.""), during a family reunion.  Ironically, Frank had no idea who died on the docks the night of his sting or that his old FBI buddy with a gambling debt sold him out.  Glass' thugs run down Frank's wife (Samantha Mathis of ""Broken Arrow"") and his young son Will (first-time actor Marcus Johnson) as they flee in futility from the family reunion.  Bobby's vengeful brother administers the last rites to Frank on the dock, but you cannot kill an action hero.  Frank survives this carnage under mysterious circumstances that defy logic.  Nevertheless, the hero is so miserable that his only consolation flows from a bottle of Wild Turkey.Along the way, Frank establishes his headquarters in a remote apartment complex where three other tenants abide; Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos of ""X-Men""), Dave (Ben Foster), and Mr.Bumpo (John Pinette).  When Saint's killers visit Frank, anybody else would have called the landlord and demanded his eviction.  Instead, this trio tries to help him, and they pay for their interference.  You'll spot the ""Othello"" homage when Frank Castle turns Saint against Livia and his second-in-command.  A bone-jarring, close-quarters combat scene that erupts between Frank and another assassin is fun to watch, too.  Frank's assailant is a Russian about three times bigger who nearly destroys not only him but also the apartment complex.As the chief villain, ""Pulp Fiction"" star John Travolta is incredibly creepy in a restrained performance as Rome emperor-like crime lord Howard Saint, and Travolta's death scene alone justifies watching this gritty movie.  As the hero's sworn enemy, Travolta isn't afraid of getting faux blood on himself.  He establishes his villainous credentials from the start when he personally executes a wayward mobster minion responsible for the demise of his arrogant son.  Incidentally, Travolta's death scene provides the movie with its signature money shot.  Not only is it by far the most over-the-top scene, but it also is truly unforgettable.  (Mind you, there are other great scenes, for instance, the Popsicle and steak interrogation scene is probably the most memorable.Altogether, ""The Punisher"" doesn't look like a comic book movie with its R-rating, but Thomas Jane cuts quite a figure as its merciless but anti-heroic protagonist.",4,Punish The Guilty!,1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,6174,"['second', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'movie',

Second, include both the theatrical cut and the extended cut on a 10th anniverary blu ray release. Each is interesting. Include the opening animated sequence and the making of featurette as well. Than, maybe some trailers or a brand new looking back feature. To top it off though, a nice slip cover, such as a new cover.
