I for one couldn't stand the comedy styling of Steve Martin from his SNL days, but this was the first movie that I saw him do some serious acting in.  GREAT movie!  Thoroughly enjoyed it.",5,Take a leap of faith with Steve Martin,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,208,"['What', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'comedy', 'styling', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'SNL', 'days', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'saw', 'do', 'serious', 'acting', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'Thoroughly', 'enjoyed']",The Out-of-Towners / Leap of Faith
1156840,A37OYVYHR5U4NU,B0017CW5U8,Freudian Slips,"[14, 14]","When I was a kid, my favorite movie was ""The Music Man"". I must have seen it in the theater at least a dozen times. I loved the story of the con man who got caught in his own con and I experienced the same joy watching Steve Martin do his own version of Prof. Harold Hill (now Jonas Nightengale) in ""Leap of Faith.""This movie was truly misunderstood by most critics who tried to compare it -unfavorably- with such films as ""Elmer Gantry"" or characterize it as a statement on televangelism. They also focused too heavily on the emotional, and therefore, ""unrealistic"" ending. Even worse, the studio mis-marketed the film, and you'll often find it in the comedy section of the video store. Warning: it is not a comedy. Yes, there are light moments- how can there not be with Steve Martin- but this film is much richer than a typical Steve Martin comedy.Steve Martin's performance is superb and magical and should have been nominated for an Oscar. The film score is tremendous with some of the best gospel singers in the country providing the music- not to mention Meatloaf! Contrary to the critics, I found the ending mesmerizing- left open enough for interpretation, moving, and inspirational.So, ignore most of the critics, approach it with an open mind, and be willing to listen to the message. ""I always think there's a band, kid,"" said Harold Hill in ""The Music Man""; ""Just because a person doesn't show up doesn't mean the person doesn't care about him,"" says Jonas Nightengale in ""Leap of Faith"". Enjoy!In this newly-released edition, ""Leap of Faith"" is paired with another Martin movie, ""The Out of Towners.""  I haven't seen ""The Out of Towners"" yet, so I can't review it, but I would recommend you get this set just on the strength of ""Leap of Faith.""",5,Leap of Faith is one of Steve Martin's best movies,1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,1758,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'favorite', 'movie', 'was', 'Music', 'Man', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'theater', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'loved', 'story', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'got', 'caught', 'own', 'con', 'experienced', 'same', 'joy', 'watching', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'do', 'own', 'version', 'Prof.', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'now', 'Jonas', 'Nightengale', 'Leap', 'Faith', 'movie', 'was', 'truly', 'misunderstood', 'most', 'critics', 'who', 'tried', 'compare', '-unfavorably-', 'such', 'films', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'characterize', 'statement', 'televangelism', 'also', 'focused', 'too', 'heavily', 'emotional', 'therefore', 'unrealistic', 'ending', 'Even', 'worse', 'studio', 'mis-marketed', 'film', ""'ll"", 'often', 'find', 'comedy', 'section', 'video', 'store', 'Warning', 'not', 'comedy', 'Yes', 'are', 'light', 'moments-', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'Steve', 'Martin-', 'film', 'much', 'richer', 'typical', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'comedy.Steve', 'Martin', 'performance', 'superb', 'magical', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'film', 'score', 'tremendous', 'best', 'gospel', 'singers', 'country', 'providing', 'music-', 'not', 'mention', 'Meatloaf', 'Contrary', 'critics', 'found', 'ending', 'mesmerizing-', 'left', 'open', 'enough', 'interpretation', 'moving', 'inspirational.So', 'ignore', 'most', 'critics', 'approach', 'open', 'mind', 'be', 'willing', 'listen', 'message', 'always', 'think', 'band', 'kid', 'said', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'Music', 'Man', 'Just', 'person', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', ""n't"", 'mean', 'person', ""n't"", 'care', 'Jonas', 'Nightengale', 'Leap', 'Faith', 'Enjoy', 'newly-released', 'edition', 'Leap', 'Faith', 'paired', 'Martin', 'movie', 'Out', 'Towners', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Out', 'Towners', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'review', 'would', 'recommend', 'get', 'set', 'just', 'strength', 'Leap', 'Faith']",The Out-of-Towners / Leap of Faith
