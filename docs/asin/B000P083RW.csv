The main points of the storyline in the film, do turn out to be true historically.  So it is worth watching.  I personally though that this movie wasn't up to the par of the Disney version of ""Roy Roy"" or ""The Sword and The Rose.""  Somehow the acting wasn't as convincing and the lead romantic interests didn't have much chemistry.  It also looked like the actor portraying Red Hugh had too much makeup on or something.  And the dialogue wasn't as clever and filled with local dialect as in the previous Disney movies.  That being said, I still found this movie to be a pleasant one.

This type of repetition is hardly the stuff of high drama, but the actors do throw themselves into their roles, making it incredibly entertaining.  There are plenty of fights, enough to keep the title from being a lie.  Red Hugh goes after the bad guy (Gordon Jackson as Captain Leeds) with staff and sword.  There's also a dandy battle getting into a castle (pity it was theirs!).  Lots of nefarious dealings and double dealings, grand speeches, a slight romance (with Susan Hampshire), and humor.  I first saw this back in 1966 and enjoyed it immensely.  It was not, however, a box office smash for Disney.

1067675,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B000P083RW,J. Michael,"[2, 4]","Ireland. The late 16th century. Fearing a Spanish invasion, the English garrison Ireland in self defense. The native Irish, disliking the presense of English troops, debate whether to fight or negotiate. Hugh O'Donnell, the new head of his clan and apparently the most influential man in Ireland, wants to unite the clans first and then negotiate from a position of strength. Unfortunately, he is kidnapped by the English and thrown into a prison, where he spends most of the movie trying to escape. When he finally does, he rallies his men to rescue his lady love from the clutches of the English. The movie concludes with the singing of ""O'Donnell Abu"", the best part of the entire show.This is an absolutely ridiculous movie. I didn't expect a Disney movie from the 1960s to be ""Braveheart"", but then perhaps Disney shouldn't have tried to dramatize the bloody Nine Years War. I've never seen a historical depiction so anodyne, sterilized and completely fabricated. This is hackwork at its worst. We see stereotypical drunken Irish noblemen manning the battlements of medieval castles. We see the charming Susannah Hamshire pumping her fists as she cheers on a drunken donnybrook. There's no reference to English goals of national genocide, religious persecution and native dispossession. It's a joke. Why even reference Hugh O'Donnell and the war if they were going to completely eviscerate the story of all factual content?This is not to say the movie is without_any_merit.

1067678,A6GMEO3VRY51S,B000P083RW,microjoe,"[4, 4]","THE STORY: An adventure story with lots of humor thrown in. A fictional story based on a real person, this is the story of Red Hugh, the real Prince of Donegal, Hugh O'Donell. During the 16th century reign of Queen Elizabeth I, England is at war with Spain while also having a civil war with Ireland. Fearing that the Spanish will sneak through Ireland to attack, they station troops in the countryside. The Irish clans are not pleased with the occupation and plan to rally under young Prince Donegal (played very well by Peter McEnery) to fight the resistance. He suggests an offer of treaty first, then war if it is not accepted. A prophecy stated that when ""When Hugh succeeds Hugh, Ireland shall be free"". When the elder Hugh dies and Red Hugh becomes Prince, many see this as their opportunity. Spies learn of these developments and Donegal is thrown in the dungeon of a castle the English are using. He is captured and escapes not once but twice. He must fight his way back to his own castle to rescue his family and his sweetheart (Susan Hampshire, having been seen in ""Three Lives on Thomasina"" two years earlier)that are being held hostage by the British. He leads the big battle meant to turn the tables. The film is a bit confusing in the beginning but you quickly find out what the story is about.BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: At the time production on this film began Walt Disney had not made a full-length British swashbuckler since ""The Sword and the Rose"" in 1953. Walt Disney decided to use an Irish-born theatrical director named Michael O'Herlihy, who had never made a movie up to this time. The screenplay was by Disney veteran Robert Westerby, (Three Lives of Thomasina, Zorro episodes, and The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh), and was based on a book ""Red Hugh, Prince of Donegal"" by Robert T. Reilly. The casting in the film is superb, with terrific supporting actors including Andrew Keir and Gordon Jackson. Great effort was made to be as authentic as possible for this costume period piece. Maurice Carter was the art director and Anthony Mendleson designed the costumes. Artists spent months creating a tapestry that hangs as a prop but is seen only briefly on film. Music by studio composer George Bruns who based the music on a 16th century Irish folksong ""O'Donell Aboo"". Peter Ellenshaw did his usual terrific job of special photographic effects, his stunning glass matte paintings made it possible to perceive different complete castles in the background of various scenes. The studio originally planned to shoot on location and scouted the real Donegal in Ireland, but the castle was a pile of rubble. They also considered Scotland, but settled on building huge sets at Pinewood studios in England. Their task was formidable with 2 castle interiors and the town of Dublin to build for starters. Specific scenes called for moats, battlements, castle gates, dungeons, long stairways, throne rooms, banquet halls, chambers, peasant cottages and more. The big banquet scene took 200 extras and 3 days to film.The end result is similar to Disney's ""Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue"" in style but much better. Released in full screen as it was originally filmed that way. While originally created for television, the final edited version came in a bit long at 112 minutes. So instead it was released to theatres first on October 1, 1966 two months before Walt passed away. One year later it aired on NBC television as a 3 part episode show on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, beginning October 1, 8, 16, 1967. Released to VHS in 1986, it finally made it to DVD in 2008. To my eyes, it does not appear to have been re-mastered, but still looks good.",4,The clans unite!,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,3670,"['STORY', 'adventure', 'story', 'lots', 'humor', 'thrown', 'fictional', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'person', 'story', 'Red', 'Hugh', 'real', 'Prince', 'Donegal', 'Hugh', ""O'Donell"", '16th', 'century', 'reign', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'England', 'war', 'Spain', 'also', 'having', 'civil', 'war', 'Ireland', 'Fearing', 'Spanish', 'will', 'sneak', 'Ireland', 'attack', 'station', 'troops', 'countryside', 'Irish', 'clans', 'are', 'not', 'pleased', 'occupation', 'plan', 'rally', 'young', 'Prince', 'Donegal', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Peter', 'McEnery', 'fight', 'resistance', 'offer', 'treaty', 'first', 'then', 'war', 'not', 'accepted', 'prophecy', 'stated', 'when', 'When', 'Hugh', 'Hugh', 'Ireland', 'shall', 'be', 'free', 'When', 'elder', 'Hugh', 'dies', 'Red', 'Hugh', 'Prince', 'many', 'see', 'opportunity', 'Spies', 'learn', 'developments', 'Donegal', 'thrown', 'dungeon', 'castle', 'English', 'are', 'using', 'captured', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'must', 'fight', 'way', 'back', 'own', 'castle', 'rescue', 'family', 'sweetheart', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'having', 'been', 'seen', 'Three', 'Thomasina', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'British', 'big', 'battle', 'meant', 'turn', 'tables', 'film', 'bit', 'confusing', 'beginning', 'quickly', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'story', 'THE', 'SCENES', 'TRIVIA', 'time', 'production', 'film', 'began', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'had', 'not', 'made', 'full-length', 'British', 'swashbuckler', 'Sword', 'Rose', '1953', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'decided', 'use', 'Irish-born', 'theatrical', 'director', 'named', 'Michael', ""O'Herlihy"", 'who', 'had', 'never', 'made', 'movie', 'up', 'time', 'screenplay', 'was', 'Disney', 'veteran', 'Robert', 'Westerby', 'Three', 'Lives', 'Thomasina', 'Zorro', 'Scarecrow', 'Romney', 'Marsh', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'Red', 'Hugh', 'Prince', 'Donegal', 'Robert', 'T.', 'Reilly', 'casting', 'film', 'superb', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'actors', 'including', 'Andrew', 'Keir', 'Gordon', 'Jackson', 'Great', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'as', 'authentic', 'possible', 'costume', 'period', 'piece', 'Maurice', 'Carter', 'was', 'art', 'director', 'Anthony', 'Mendleson', 'designed', 'costumes', 'Artists', 'spent', 'months', 'creating', 'tapestry', 'prop', 'seen', 'only', 'briefly', 'film', 'Music', 'studio', 'composer', 'George', 'Bruns', 'who', 'based', 'music', '16th', 'century', 'Irish', ""O'Donell"", 'Aboo', 'Peter', 'Ellenshaw', 'did', 'usual', 'terrific', 'job', 'special', 'photographic', 'effects', 'stunning', 'glass', 'matte', 'paintings', 'made', 'possible', 'perceive', 'different', 'complete', 'castles', 'background', 'various', 'scenes', 'studio', 'originally', 'planned', 'shoot', 'location', 'scouted', 'real', 'Donegal', 'Ireland', 'castle', 'was', 'pile', 'rubble', 'also', 'considered', 'Scotland', 'settled', 'building', 'huge', 'sets', 'Pinewood', 'studios', 'England', 'task', 'was', 'formidable', '2', 'castle', 'interiors', 'town', 'Dublin', 'build', 'starters', 'Specific', 'scenes', 'called', 'moats', 'battlements', 'castle', 'gates', 'dungeons', 'long', 'stairways', 'throne', 'rooms', 'banquet', 'halls', 'chambers', 'peasant', 'cottages', 'more', 'big', 'banquet', 'scene', 'took', '200', 'extras', '3', 'days', 'film.The', 'end', 'result', 'similar', 'Disney', 'Rob', 'Roy', 'Highland', 'Rogue', 'style', 'much', 'better', 'Released', 'full', 'screen', 'was', 'originally', 'filmed', 'way', 'originally', 'created', 'television', 'final', 'edited', 'version', 'came', 'bit', 'long', '112', 'minutes', 'So', 'instead', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'first', 'October', '1', '1966', 'two', 'months', 'Walt', 'passed', 'away', 'One', 'year', 'later', 'aired', 'NBC', 'television', '3', 'part', 'episode', 'show', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Color', 'beginning', 'October', '1', '8', '16', '1967', 'Released', 'VHS', '1986', 'finally', 'made', 'DVD', '2008', 'eyes', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 're-mastered', 'still', 'good']",N/A

This film begins by failing to show a single depredation by the English that would cause you to have any sympathy for the Irish. The film begins with an Irish prince with bad hair-dye saying he is going to attack the English. Lots of bad acting by the supporting cast. The writers of this film make no effort to grab your attention with anything of interst for the first hour. By the time anything that could be interesting happens; you so dislike the boring Irish that you hope the English make short work of them. There is a castle, but the interior sets are poor. Not a likeable character in the group. I remember Disney's ""Rob Roy The Highland Rogue"", ""Light in the Forest"", or ""Johnny Tremain"" being much better than this; though I remember those all being ""B"" movies.The film is unbelievable, because you cannot believe that real conversations would be this boring. The director had never made a movie before and it shows. Walt Disney was not involved in this film. He was building Disney-World Florida, running his animation studio and Disneyland California, the Cal Arts School, planning a never to be ski-resort, spending more time with his family on vacation knowing he was dying in the final days of lung-cancer. This movie would have been over-priced at $7. The high price is part of the scam.

If you want to get someone interested in the subject, especially a young person, this would be a good start.  I read the book, back in the day, and really loved it.  The book explains a lot that was not covered in the movie.  There are very few movies about real historical Irish figures that don't have them as terrorists or pirates.  (The English were really good at labeling their enemies as both.)
