1043363,A3R1RMX39QI265,B000M343CG,"Karris ""yassa""","[3, 3]","This show is Spinal Tap meets The Monkees, with kids in the place of adults. This is marketed for kids, and it pretty much is for them, but there is a lot going on here that spans age groups. I'm sure many parents get a kick out of it as much as their kids do. I know I do. The writing and dialog is top notch, and the actors actually act like kids, not the usual phoney stuff you see on similar shows, many of which are generally unwatchable. Either Polly Draper really understands them, and/or the kids all have input into the show. They all have good chemistry. Nat's singing is solid, and Alex's dialog delivery is hilarious. The songs are 60's pop/indie style, and for what they are, far more listenable than the horrible Alecia Keys/Justin Timberlake clone stuff you hear on many other shows on the same channel. My one and only criticism is the title. The band originally called themselves the Silver Boulders, which is a much better name for a band. But it's not much of a complaint. I wish the show and Nat and Alex all the success in the world. Keep rockin'!",5,Don't let the title fool you.,1175644800,"04 4, 2007",2007,1068,"['show', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Monkees', 'kids', 'place', 'adults', 'marketed', 'kids', 'pretty', 'much', 'lot', 'going', 'here', 'age', 'groups', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'parents', 'get', 'kick', 'as', 'much', 'kids', 'do', 'know', 'do', 'writing', 'dialog', 'top', 'notch', 'actors', 'actually', 'act', 'kids', 'not', 'usual', 'phoney', 'stuff', 'see', 'similar', 'shows', 'many', 'are', 'generally', 'unwatchable', 'Polly', 'Draper', 'really', 'kids', 'have', 'input', 'show', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Nat', 'singing', 'solid', 'Alex', 'dialog', 'delivery', 'hilarious', 'songs', 'are', '60', 'pop/indie', 'style', 'what', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'listenable', 'horrible', 'Alecia', 'Keys/Justin', 'Timberlake', 'clone', 'stuff', 'hear', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'same', 'channel', 'one', 'only', 'criticism', 'title', 'band', 'originally', 'called', 'Silver', 'Boulders', 'much', 'better', 'name', 'band', 'not', 'much', 'complaint', 'wish', 'show', 'Nat', 'Alex', 'success', 'world', 'Keep', 'rockin']",The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie

I found the price for the item was really low and was very happy with the value I got.  Someday Nat Wolf will be one of the best stars. For his age he is very talented as well as the rest of his band. I look forward to more cds showing this talent. He puts a lot of effort in the music he writes. I also want to thank Amazon for their help in receiving the extra cd that was to come with it. It shows that they really want to do what is best for the consumer. I did receive it and Paramount was great too, sending it by UPS, I really appreciated their effort to please us also.",5,A Really Good Purchase,1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,682,"['Naked', 'Brothers', 'Band', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'purchase', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'songs', 'played', 'found', 'price', 'item', 'was', 'really', 'low', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'value', 'got', 'Someday', 'Nat', 'Wolf', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'stars', 'age', 'very', 'talented', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'band', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'cds', 'showing', 'talent', 'lot', 'effort', 'music', 'also', 'want', 'thank', 'Amazon', 'help', 'receiving', 'extra', 'cd', 'was', 'come', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'consumer', 'did', 'receive', 'Paramount', 'was', 'great', 'too', 'sending', 'UPS', 'really', 'appreciated', 'effort', 'please', 'also']",The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie
