Though this is animated it's actually a very complex and mature story.  That's not to say a younger viewer can't appreciate it, but it's mature enough where an adult should not feel ashamed to watch it.If you want a retelling of Doctor Strange's backstory this film covers the bulk of it quite well.  The animation is lush and vivid.  The writing is so well done that you would hope that this is what the live action Doctor Strange movie would look like.

This direct to DVD show is fairly watchable, and stays vaguely true to the Dr. Strange mythos - Wong, Mordo, Dormammu, the Ancient one are all here. Mordo is still a good guy gone bad. The animation is very similar to Marvel's other animated efforts.While a bit more ""Kung Fu Fighting"" than one might expect, I'm sure the target audience is not 50 year old collectors of silver age comics. In this regard however, one misses the sometimes amazing visuals that artist Steve Ditko brought to the original 1960's comic book series.

Nonetheless, I am pleased and impressed with the talent and creativity that goes into these Marvel Ani-movies. The comics corporations just do tooo much foot-dragging in adapting their properties to the big or small screen, denying fans the fun and excitement of seeing their favorites spring off the comic page. I've enjoyed the Avengers 1 & 2, and Iron Man, and really wonder what's going to happen with the upcoming future Avengers tale. It's just fun seeing these characters being treated in a polished and respectful manner, and I really wish DC comics would get on the animated movie bandwagon. One thing I don't get is why they don't get these a short run in theaters before going to DVD.

Having viewed the latest (fourth) in the series, ""Doctor Strange"" I can say it is the best looking of the bunch so far.  The script and story are nicely done too - a straight but completely modernized version of the origin of Doctor Strange.The movie is quite short, so there is not much sense in giving away any of the details.  The modernizations are completely true to the characters and there are numerous small things and tiny details that long time fans will see and hear and will appreciate but don't distract the uninitiated.With 40 plus years of character development available, it's refreshing to see this kind of update which is really a simplification and optimization of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original work.  The writer did a great job distilling so much into this package and made the origin tale interesting instead of just a setup for the main story.  It's a shame Steve Ditko was not credited on-screen as he is in the Spider-Man features.  He deserved a lot of credit for Doctor Strange - his images and art that were the signature of the comic book influenced so much of how we now expect the world of magic to appear in movies and tv today.  Only a few panels were devoted to the origin story in the comics, but the slight to Ditko is unforgivable.  He is mentioned in the special features by Stan Lee and several other comic book writers -- they know.  Of course they know.This is my very first Blu-Ray disc and the images and sound produced here are truly incredible.  The movie is in 1080p/24fps and this appears to take a lot of processing power to display.  My Sony BDP-S300 displayed a ""loading"" screen for a few minutes and then another loading screen with animated gears for a few minutes before the top menu even appeared.  The disc has HD 7.1 sound - so if you have the sound system and a 1080p capable set, this is about as good a demo disc as there is.This disc is a definite buy for your collection.  Very interesting.  With all this technology and all these great characters many more great movies can be made.  But please get the script thoroughly polished and make good stories for these marvel features.  The opportunity to create something truly lasting completely depends on the script and story.  This disc is perhaps not in that category, but I can clearly see the potential for greatness that exists in these properties if enough care an attention is put into them.And please credit the original creators.  Whatever royalty you might have to pay them is worth it.  Legalities aside they must be given credit where due and it is richly due to them here.",4,Marvel Movies Getting Better on several levels,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,2707,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'state', 'art', 'improved', 'so', 'much', 'Marvel', 'Animated', 'movies', 'are', 'viable', 'Having', 'viewed', 'latest', 'fourth', 'series', 'Doctor', 'Strange', 'can', 'say', 'best', 'looking', 'bunch', 'so', 'far', 'script', 'story', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'too', 'straight', 'completely', 'modernized', 'version', 'origin', 'Doctor', 'Strange.The', 'movie', 'quite', 'short', 'not', 'much', 'sense', 'giving', 'away', 'details', 'modernizations', 'are', 'completely', 'true', 'characters', 'are', 'numerous', 'small', 'things', 'tiny', 'details', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'will', 'see', 'hear', 'will', 'appreciate', 'do', ""n't"", 'distract', 'uninitiated.With', '40', 'years', 'character', 'development', 'available', 'refreshing', 'see', 'kind', 'update', 'really', 'simplification', 'optimization', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'original', 'work', 'writer', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'distilling', 'so', 'much', 'package', 'made', 'origin', 'tale', 'interesting', 'instead', 'just', 'setup', 'main', 'story', 'shame', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'was', 'not', 'credited', 'on-screen', 'Spider-Man', 'features', 'deserved', 'lot', 'credit', 'Doctor', 'Strange', 'images', 'art', 'were', 'signature', 'comic', 'book', 'influenced', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'now', 'expect', 'world', 'magic', 'appear', 'movies', 'tv', 'today', 'Only', 'few', 'panels', 'were', 'devoted', 'origin', 'story', 'comics', 'slight', 'Ditko', 'unforgivable', 'mentioned', 'special', 'features', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'several', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'writers', 'know', 'course', 'know.This', 'very', 'first', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'images', 'sound', 'produced', 'here', 'are', 'truly', 'incredible', 'movie', '1080p/24fps', 'take', 'lot', 'processing', 'power', 'display', 'Sony', 'BDP-S300', 'displayed', 'loading', 'screen', 'few', 'minutes', 'then', 'loading', 'screen', 'animated', 'gears', 'few', 'minutes', 'top', 'menu', 'even', 'appeared', 'disc', '7.1', 'sound', 'so', 'have', 'sound', 'system', '1080p', 'capable', 'set', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'demo', 'disc', 'is.This', 'disc', 'definite', 'buy', 'collection', 'Very', 'interesting', 'technology', 'great', 'characters', 'many', 'more', 'great', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'please', 'get', 'script', 'thoroughly', 'polished', 'make', 'good', 'stories', 'marvel', 'features', 'opportunity', 'create', 'something', 'truly', 'lasting', 'completely', 'script', 'story', 'disc', 'perhaps', 'not', 'category', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'potential', 'greatness', 'properties', 'enough', 'care', 'attention', 'put', 'them.And', 'please', 'credit', 'original', 'creators', 'royalty', 'might', 'have', 'pay', 'Legalities', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'credit', 'where', 'due', 'richly', 'due', 'here']",N/A

Dr. Strange happens to be another of my preferred characters.This is not a canon story, but rather a envisioned retelling meant to garner new fans. Bryse Johnson does a great job voicing the arrogant Dr. Strange, in every aspect. The plot reveals the motivation to be the very best at what he does, through the loss of family.

1079257,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000R5OFNQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[9, 9]","I've always been into the more hands-on of the superhero crowd, so you might see why Dr. Strange isn't one of my comic book favorites. Nevertheless, there were times when I looked in on him and relished his wacky adventures and trippy forays into funky looking dimensions, as creatively rendered by artist Steve Ditko. Given that my interest in the Sorcerer Supreme is anemic, I must mention that stories about Strange were never better than when Stan Lee was writing them waaay back in the '60s. I've always thought one of the coolest things about the Dr. Strange mythos were the wonderfully exotic sounding invocations (as imagined by Stan) which Dr. Strange would righteously toss out: ""By the all-seeing Eye of Agamotto!"" or ""By the hoary hosts of Hoggoth!"" Or how about ""By the shades of the shadowy Seraphim!""? But nary a one is uttered in this animated film, however, as we witness Dr. Strange's origin, a stage in which he probably wasn't that familiar with Agamotto, Hoggoth, or Seraphim.To the plot now: Stephen Strange is a talented neurosurgeon. But he's egotistical, callous, and uncaring. He's even big enough of a jerk that he rejects a plea for help regarding a brain-diseased child who sees in her nightmares a dreaded countenance swathed in flames. One evening, while driving, Stephen careens off the road and hurtles down a cliff, which results in irreparable damage to his hands. Despairing, having lost his fortunes, and having exhausted all treatment options for his injuries, he bleakly reaches the end of his rope. But fate intervenes in the presence of Wong, a sorcerer who senses potential in Strange. Wong sends him to a remote Tibetan monastery, to possibly become a student of the Ancient One. However, Strange, being not much into Eastern mysticism, merely seeks to unearth a cure for his mangled hands.No surprise then that it takes Strange a while to ""accept the unacceptable,"" but once he does, he graduates from the grasshopper routine and begins to learn the arcane arts at a prodigious pace. In time, he comes to learn of the Sanctum Sanctorum which houses the Nexus, the center of all dimensions. It is the Nexus which the Ancient One and his disciples continue to safeguard from the Dread Dormammu. Dormammu, a malevolent, otherdimensional being formed of absolute magic, has repeatedly sent his eldritch creatures to storm the Sanctum. And, with each successive attempt, he gets ever closer. Dr. Strange figures out that Dormammu's plan is somehow linked to the widespread epidemic of comatose children which has overran many hospital wards. As he sets out to help the children, Dormammu launches an all out final assault on the Sanctum. Now will the true Sorcerer Supreme please stand up?This being the origin story, parts of the film are naturally slow going. We learn of Strange's tragic backstory and how he came to be so cold-hearted and materialistic in his former civilian life. The flashbacks work to flesh out the character and to further engage the viewer. I'm not sure if the version in Marvel's mainstream continuity had a kid sister. But young April and her plight make Strange a more sympathetic person.When not focusing on Strange, the film shifts to the exploits of the Ancient One's disciples, in particular to Wong and the surly, arrogant Mordo. Mordo takes it for granted that he is the Ancient One's successor to the title of Sorcerer Supreme. Wong is quite dissimilar to the manservant version from the comics. Here, he's more a colleague and even mentor to Strange. And he has hair. Wong is devoted to the Ancient One and mistrusts Mordo and his lofty ambitions. Meanwhile, they and the other disciples continuously take on Dormammu's ever encroaching minions in heartstopping magical scraps.With the show of magic being generated to mostly craft weaponry out of thin air, there's no room for the classic Dr. Strange incantations, as I've said (but two more classic phrases I just about forgot are ""By the Vishanti!"" and ""By the Crimson Bands of Cytorrak!""). It would've nice to see more esoteric mysticism going on. It's a bit odd seeing the good doctor engaging in a strenuous physical activity like sword fighting. At least, we get to see him make use of astral projection, a staple of the Dr. Strange comics. Dr. Strange does have over 40 years of published history to draw from. But, to reiterate, I'm not a Dr. Strange connoisseur, so I'm not sure exactly how much was altered in this film. One thing that's been changed for sure are his duds as this incarnation has him sporting a new costume that seems austere but is nevertheless very stylin'.DR. STRANGE: THE SORCERER SUPREME is the fourth direct-to-dvd collaboration between Marvel and LionsGate and decidedly improves on the stinky animatedThe Invincible Iron Mandvd which it succeeds. We get very nice animation, explosive and well-choreographed fight sequences, and a decent story with enough soap to tug at the heart and enough tussles to keep content the adventurer within you. People die in this one, thus lending the film more depth and high stakes relevance than, say, your average Saturday cartoon episode.DR. STRANGE: THE SORCERER SUPREME is presented in wide screen. Special features include: Marvel Video Game Cinematics; the 14-minute-long segment ""The Origin of Doctor Strange,"" featuring interviews with comic book writers Stan Lee and Steve Englehart; A First Look at the promising upcoming ""Avengers Reborn"" (which is set in the future and features Ultron and the Teen Avengers); Doctor Strange concept art; and a trailer gallery. But no film commentary. Which sucks.I say this one merits a rating of three and a half stars. I wouldn't at all be averse to a sequel. Marvel and LionsGate have something good going here with their direct to dvd animated releases. Keep 'em coming. I'm certainly down with the next project, Avengers Reborn. Now is it too much to ask that someone release a dvd of the 93-minuteDr. Strange / Movietelevision pilot, which came out way back in 1978?",4,"""Love. Loss. Pain.

1079258,A1PYI4W3MO7V6S,B000R5OFNQ,Homer's Wisdom,"[2, 3]","The video was dark and the action tight. Going into this film I had no fore knowledge of the Dr. Strange character or comic but I was still able to really enjoy the story and didn't leave the film feeling like I was left out, yet I could tell that there was some things put in certain places that were for the comic fans too. This amazing balance is a hard one to reach and I applaud them for obtaining it.The tale opens with an intense chase scene with the pupils of the Ancient One pursuing a servant of Dormammu. This chase passes by the car of the gifted and selfish Dr. Strange. The tale continues and Dr. Strange is struck with a tragedy that sets him on a path to recover his life. During the quest he is led to the training temple of the Ancient One and receives healing and instruction while there.One of the qualities that I really enjoyed in this tale was the clear development of the character of Dr. Strange. In the beginning he is a selfish, self-obsessed, cruel, haunted man. They did a great job of creating a feeling of disgust and pity over his character in the start of the film, I found my self caring about the character because I knew something obviously led him to be the creep that was before me and yet he was still a creep that could just walk away from the woman's suffering. Then as the tale goes on we learn about what happened to him that hardened his heart and we watch Dr. Strange forgive himself and grow into a wonderful person. It was quite a delightful experience that gave so much depth to the story.The setting and animation was wonderful and crisp. The movement was fluid and action dynamic. One aspect of the setting that I really enjoyed was how the creators limited the abilities of the magic users. Everyone learned how to manipulate their environment by realizing the oneness of it all but each person was limited to their own innate abilities. This way each character had both power and limitation, they did a great job of showing both. This helped to give great tension as you watch the characters being powerful and when they were faced with their limitations their downfall as well.",4,This was a great story and well told,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,2130,"['video', 'was', 'dark', 'action', 'tight', 'Going', 'film', 'had', 'fore', 'knowledge', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'character', 'comic', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'really', 'enjoy', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'film', 'feeling', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'yet', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'things', 'put', 'certain', 'places', 'were', 'comic', 'fans', 'too', 'amazing', 'balance', 'hard', 'one', 'reach', 'applaud', 'obtaining', 'it.The', 'tale', 'intense', 'chase', 'scene', 'pupils', 'Ancient', 'One', 'pursuing', 'servant', 'Dormammu', 'chase', 'passes', 'car', 'gifted', 'selfish', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'tale', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'struck', 'tragedy', 'path', 'recover', 'life', 'quest', 'led', 'training', 'temple', 'Ancient', 'One', 'healing', 'instruction', 'there.One', 'qualities', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'tale', 'was', 'clear', 'development', 'character', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'beginning', 'selfish', 'self-obsessed', 'cruel', 'haunted', 'man', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'feeling', 'disgust', 'pity', 'character', 'start', 'film', 'found', 'self', 'caring', 'character', 'knew', 'something', 'obviously', 'led', 'be', 'creep', 'was', 'yet', 'was', 'still', 'creep', 'could', 'just', 'walk', 'away', 'woman', 'suffering', 'Then', 'tale', 'learn', 'what', 'happened', 'hardened', 'heart', 'watch', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'forgive', 'grow', 'wonderful', 'person', 'was', 'quite', 'delightful', 'experience', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'story.The', 'setting', 'animation', 'was', 'wonderful', 'crisp', 'movement', 'was', 'fluid', 'action', 'dynamic', 'One', 'aspect', 'setting', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'how', 'creators', 'limited', 'abilities', 'magic', 'users', 'Everyone', 'learned', 'how', 'manipulate', 'environment', 'realizing', 'oneness', 'person', 'was', 'limited', 'own', 'innate', 'abilities', 'way', 'character', 'had', 'power', 'limitation', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'helped', 'give', 'great', 'tension', 'watch', 'characters', 'being', 'powerful', 'when', 'were', 'faced', 'limitations', 'downfall', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Given that Marvel's other films hadn't done well, even with their all-star Avengers cast, I wasn't expecting much from Dr. Strange.  But surprisingly, this was quite enjoyable.It begins with Dr. Strange as a brilliant yet self-centered surgeon whose interests lie solely in wealth and prestige.  But an encounter with the spiritual realm causes a crippling car accident, leaving Dr. Strange without the intricate use of his hands.  Strange exhausts his fortune seeking reconstruction surgery, but no-one is able to restore his fractured hands.  Years later, poor and destitute, a desperate and near suicidal Strange journeys to Tibet to explore his last hope, ""the Ancient One"".  Dr. Strange seeks the restoration of his hands, but his magical tutors are more interested in the redemption of his soul.  Strange slowly begins to discover the world of magic and learns to become its guardian.  Finally, he and his companions must make a stand against the dark forces seeking to destroy Earth.I never thought a movie about magic could be this interesting.  I expected some really laborious magical duels that just look like two people doing sign language, but thankfully Dr. Strange delivers both visually and kinetically. The action is beautifully choreographed and emotionally resonant.  The art style is sharp, visually engaging, and memorable.  But the highlight of Dr. Strange is in its characters and storytelling; the journey of a selfish yet resourceful doctor to a humble leader and protector of earth.

After a mystical vision causes him to crash his car, his hands are crushed, and he can't perform surgery anymore, Strange uses all his funds up scouring the world looking for a way to restore his hands. When he's at the end of his rope, a stranger named Wong appears and tells him to see out the enigmatic Ancient One in Tibet.Once finally in Tibet, Strange joins in with Wong's crew of sorcerers, which is spearheaded by the agressive Mordu(""Baron Mordu""). Their troops are after the demonic entity Dormammu who was sealed off in another dimension ages ago by the Ancient One. Strange starts his training under them to be a magician, during which he finds his hands are healed. Mordu becomes enraged when he learns that the title of Sorcerer Supreme(their grand poobah), and he strikes a deal with Dormammu to get rid of Strange if he kills the Ancient One for him.Dormammu is released through the dreams of children in a coma, and destroys the Sanctum Sanctorum which bridges the gap between our world and the demon world. After dying, the Ancient One passes his power on to Strange with his mystical amulet(the Eye Of Agamotto). With his new strength, Strange manages to defeat Mordu, and absorbs all of Dormammu's magic. Strange then remakes the Sanctum with Wong, and begins his new life as the Sorcerer Supreme.This made for a decent secret origin for Dr. Strange. I think Marvel chose to take a chance on doing an animated movie of him to try and introduce him to a new generation of fans. With magic being a big thing in Hollywood at the time, Dr. Strange was a good attempt, although it's hard to say how non-hardcore comic geeks would accept it. The animation is pretty good, exceptionally better than what was used in the previous Iron Man movie. It's hard to say if this one is a keeper for your video library, but very much worth a rental or borrowing from a friend.",3,The Doctor is in,1332460800,"03 23, 2012",2012,2362,"['about', 'two', 'other', 'failed', 'attempts', 'getting', 'own', 'movie', 'say', 'what', 'will', 'actually', 'dug', 'Doctor', 'Mordred', 'Marvel', 'Animation', 'decided', 'take', 'original', 'Doctor', 'make', 'fourth', 'film', 'Lionsgate', 'previous', 'animated', 'movies', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'connection', 'was', 'treated', 'own', 'story.Pompous-ass', 'Stephen', 'Strange', 'one', 'leading', 'surgeons', 'field', 'only', 'interested', 'unique', 'cases', 'wealthy', 'patients', 'mystical', 'vision', 'crash', 'car', 'hands', 'are', 'crushed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'perform', 'surgery', 'anymore', 'Strange', 'funds', 'up', 'scouring', 'world', 'looking', 'way', 'restore', 'hands', 'When', 'end', 'rope', 'stranger', 'named', 'Wong', 'see', 'out', 'enigmatic', 'Ancient', 'One', 'Tibet.Once', 'finally', 'Tibet', 'Strange', 'Wong', 'crew', 'sorcerers', 'spearheaded', 'agressive', 'Mordu', 'Baron', 'Mordu', 'troops', 'are', 'demonic', 'entity', 'Dormammu', 'who', 'was', 'sealed', 'off', 'dimension', 'ago', 'Ancient', 'One', 'Strange', 'training', 'be', 'magician', 'hands', 'are', 'healed', 'Mordu', 'enraged', 'when', 'title', 'Sorcerer', 'Supreme', 'grand', 'poobah', 'deal', 'Dormammu', 'get', 'rid', 'Strange', 'Ancient', 'One', 'him.Dormammu', 'released', 'dreams', 'children', 'coma', 'Sanctum', 'Sanctorum', 'gap', 'world', 'demon', 'world', 'dying', 'Ancient', 'One', 'power', 'Strange', 'mystical', 'amulet', 'Eye', 'Agamotto', 'new', 'strength', 'Strange', 'defeat', 'Mordu', 'Dormammu', 'magic', 'Strange', 'then', 'Sanctum', 'Wong', 'new', 'life', 'Sorcerer', 'Supreme.This', 'made', 'decent', 'secret', 'origin', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'think', 'Marvel', 'chose', 'take', 'chance', 'doing', 'animated', 'movie', 'try', 'introduce', 'new', 'generation', 'fans', 'magic', 'being', 'big', 'thing', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'was', 'good', 'attempt', 'hard', 'say', 'how', 'non-hardcore', 'comic', 'geeks', 'would', 'accept', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'exceptionally', 'better', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'previous', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movie', 'hard', 'say', 'one', 'keeper', 'video', 'library', 'very', 'much', 'rental', 'borrowing', 'friend']",N/A

1079265,A3LH2QWOA9Y7HT,B000R5OFNQ,"Jim ""blue sonnet lover""","[0, 1]","Because of the undeserved B level status of this character, I let this movie sit on the dusty shelf of a half off store for about half a year before I shelled out $2.72 to see it. I had already been let down by a couple of Marvel's other outings; Doctor Strange hardly inspires confidence (by modern standards) considering that he hasn't made a recent stab at box office bucks.However, after being let down by Green Lantern's box office stab and blown away by DC's animated lament to the fans, ""We forgive you and awesome cartoons!,"" I decided to let marvel apologize for never giving Stephen Strange the chance to make sorcery sexy again.APOLOGY ACCEPTED, MARVEL. I had a lot of fun watching this picture and I went in with pretty low expectation. As the opening scene started, I was already thinking about the deodorant stick or tube of chap stick I could have bought for the money, but then this incredible action started to unfold involving characters that immediately made me interested in them. That's the key, charismatic characters and in this, several characters are never really introduced, but make an impression anyway due to design and you miss them as the body count rises.Yes, much like the Green Lanterns, these sorcerers enjoy slightly shorter lives than insects and it's understandable. They fight creatures larger than semi trucks and gargantuan floating fire heads. In this, magic spells have to hold and if the monster or whatever you are fighting breaks through, you are right in the way, SQUISH. That reminds me of the lanterns, enemies smash their conjurations all the time.Stephen Strange is a bit of a Bat Man type (who knew), he's rich, he's distinguished, debonair, but unlike Bruce, he is stuck up and indifferent about the lower classes. He's pretty easy to hate, but even here, he is animated to be so slick and urbane that I at least, just accepted that he is that way. Every insanely rich person can't be expected to be humble and magnanimous. Especially a doctor, they have to actually work their way to riches; no shame on them for unrealistically expecting everyone else to do so. (Yes I'm humanizing a fictional character, let me be!)Now, onto my dislikes: I don't think we got enough time to see Stephen as his old pre super hero transformation. I was just getting to know him when the crash happens and his character is ""changed"" for the better, but the transformation happened too fast and in flashes of him paying for more elaborate and expensive surgeries; the flashing took away the weight of what was happening: rich doctor , losing it all, walking in the shoes of the...uninsured. ;-)Also, I always welcome medical + sci fi/fantasy, but recoil when I can't spot anything ""medical"" happening. With more and more descriptive medical dramas on tv, we are becoming more of a medically sensitive audience, maybe we still couldn't graduate medical school, but we know what to ""look"" for in a medical drama. What of the chill inducing reading of the medical report that describes all of the different pins and screws used to hold the patient's bones together (common medical drama fair), and at least I would think that if a doctor's hands were broken, the fingers should shake (the classic surgeon fear) or not be able to close or extend or jerk. Strange's hands never do that in this and the scars that also could have been a disturbing medical element aren't shown except in one or two shots. They should have been there prominent to constantly remind us that this man had been hurt in this way.He's got broken hands and he still makes a fist when the door man lets him into his apartment straight out of the hospital? I think any skater boy who's ever taken a particularly gnarly spill could tell you that wouldn't fly.If you were to turn to this half way into it, you'd never know that his hands are hurt because they bend sometimes and tend to make due. I know a few scenes were shown to try and ""remind"" us they don't work, like when he ties brushes to his hands to wash floors, but how did he tie them in the first place? Plus, oh so blatantly, he climbs a cliff face to reach the Temple and he uses the knocker without much problem. If you give a character a medical condition; you gotta respect that condition. Making the character able to use his hands a little, but with constant shaking could have solved the problem of inconsistency and made the character's condition more medically sound.But besides, little things like that, I adore this. I especially like when Stephen comes into his own and steps out of his chambers drenched in silken garments and looking very...sexy. I look forward to more of that in the second feature, which I hope this gets one. Just one more criticism, the CGI sucked, but sucky cgi is becoming more common place these days, nothing strange about that.",4,No one ever said : Bat Man esque,1323907200,"12 15,

Hulk VS.= Loved the Wolverine one, but the Thor one was just plain bad.  Planet Hulk I feel was excellent.  BUT, the best one so far I have seen is this Dr. Strange release.I'm not really a fan of Dr. Strange, however, I was hoping to see a decent film on the charactor.  I feel the style of the Lionsgate animation for these Marvel features just don't fit, yet, for Dr. Strange, it works.  Maybe it's because it deals with Ancient Sorcerey is the reason this animation style seems to work.Unlike many Marvel films (Like the 1st 40 plus minutes of the terrible 2004 HULK movie), too much of the films are taken up by the origins (Best LIVE action Marvel film that got to the point with it was Fantastic Four).  Yet, Dr. Strange's story was compelling.  Seeing him evolve from a bitter doctor to a man overcoming his burdens and earning his rights as a great hero flowed very well in this feature.

They were all pretty much just there to either motivate Strange in the right direction, or to cause conflict.  The flashbacks were good and helped build Strange's character and motivation.  I thought his transformation from a crippled doctor to a sorcerer was a little rushed but all in all it's better to speed things up than to let them drag.The features included a look into the history of Strange in the comics with interviews with former writers of the series and the producers of the movie.
