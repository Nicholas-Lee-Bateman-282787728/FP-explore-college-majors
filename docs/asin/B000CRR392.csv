961593,AK0GK2UIIPI38,B000CRR392,"Joel L. Johnson ""Drifter for hire""","[8, 11]","I was in awe when I saw that this was being released.  It is unprecedented to get an official release of entire games, an entire World Series, and even two additional games (including the wonderful El Duque inning).  I'm afraid us Sox fans are so used to playing 2nd fiddle that we're thinking everything is an injustice.  The Red Sox set NEEDED the ALCS, as that was far more thrilling than the actual World Series (aside from them actually winning it of course).  And it costs more, too.  This set does need to include a section on the A.J. incident.  And the broadcast by Rooney and Farmer would be wonderful.  But we should relish this set for what it is, not what it isn't.  Now for years to come we can refer people to this set to have them check it out for themselves.",5,Rather disappointed...in some of these reviews,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,775,"['was', 'awe', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'unprecedented', 'get', 'official', 'release', 'entire', 'games', 'entire', 'World', 'Series', 'even', 'two', 'additional', 'games', 'including', 'wonderful', 'El', 'Duque', 'inning', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'Sox', 'fans', 'are', 'so', 'used', 'playing', '2nd', 'fiddle', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'everything', 'injustice', 'Red', 'Sox', 'set', 'NEEDED', 'ALCS', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'thrilling', 'actual', 'World', 'Series', 'actually', 'winning', 'course', 'more', 'too', 'set', 'need', 'include', 'section', 'A.J', 'incident', 'broadcast', 'Rooney', 'Farmer', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'should', 'relish', 'set', 'what', 'not', 'what', ""n't"", 'Now', 'years', 'come', 'can', 'refer', 'people', 'set', 'have', 'check', 'out']",Chicago White Sox: 2005 World Series

I assume the 7th disc will contain bonus material.It would have been nice to have all 12 games in the White Sox' run (or at least the 11 victories), since the two clinching playoff games were on the road, but I assume the DVD producers don't think the market justifies such a set given that the World Series had a low viewer rating.

As previously mentioned, all games are presented in widescreen format.  Since the games were broadcast in HD, why not release one SD set with the games in full screen format and one HD set with the games in widescreen?  The widescreen format bugged me at first, but my eyes adjusted and I was fine.

This is a wonderful 7-DVD box set featuring all four complete World Series games, the complete clinchers from the ALDS (including the stunning bases-loaded, no outs performance by El Duque in the bottom of the sixth, in its entirety!) and AL Championship Series and a nice bonus disc with extended player interviews, locker room championship celebration and footage from the championship parade in downtown Chicago.  DVD menus are easy to follow and allow the viewer to go directly to whichever half inning they choose (great for zooming right to those incredible moments occuring throughout the Series) in addition to viewing each game in its entirety.  I also enjoyed the statistical and trivia information provided with each DVD slim case.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the games (although complete) do not feature any of the pre-game ceremonies (it would have really been nice to have the late, great Lou Rawls performing the National Anthem before Game #2, not to mention the Latino Legends festivities before Game #4, although there are some brief highlights from that in the MLB World Series DVD) and post-game coverage is pretty much limited to what aired before the first commercial break.  Finally we have to endure play-by-play from Chris Berman in the ALDS (he wasn't cheering TOO much for the Red Sox, was he?) and the team of Joe Buck and Tim McCarver for the ALCS and World Series (way too much time bellyaching over alleged ""missed calls"" and they seemed to be leaning towards Houston with their play-by-play and analysis).  Despite these flaws this is a prized collectible no White Sox fan should be without.",4,"It never gets tiring, folks!!!",1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,1743,"['What', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'said', '2005', 'World', 'Champion', 'White', 'Sox', 'wonderful', '7-DVD', 'box', 'set', 'featuring', 'four', 'complete', 'World', 'Series', 'games', 'complete', 'clinchers', 'ALDS', 'including', 'stunning', 'bases-loaded', 'outs', 'performance', 'El', 'Duque', 'bottom', 'sixth', 'entirety', 'AL', 'Championship', 'Series', 'nice', 'bonus', 'disc', 'extended', 'player', 'interviews', 'locker', 'room', 'championship', 'celebration', 'footage', 'championship', 'parade', 'downtown', 'Chicago', 'DVD', 'menus', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'allow', 'viewer', 'go', 'directly', 'whichever', 'half', 'inning', 'choose', 'great', 'zooming', 'right', 'incredible', 'moments', 'occuring', 'Series', 'addition', 'viewing', 'game', 'entirety', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'statistical', 'trivia', 'information', 'provided', 'DVD', 'slim', 'case', 'only', 'thing', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'games', 'complete', 'do', 'not', 'feature', 'pre-game', 'ceremonies', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'late', 'great', 'Lou', 'Rawls', 'performing', 'National', 'Anthem', 'Game', '2', 'not', 'mention', 'Latino', 'Legends', 'festivities', 'Game', '4', 'are', 'brief', 'highlights', 'MLB', 'World', 'Series', 'DVD', 'post-game', 'coverage', 'pretty', 'much', 'limited', 'what', 'aired', 'first', 'commercial', 'break', 'Finally', 'have', 'endure', 'play-by-play', 'Chris', 'Berman', 'ALDS', 'was', ""n't"", 'cheering', 'TOO', 'much', 'Red', 'Sox', 'was', 'team', 'Joe', 'Buck', 'Tim', 'McCarver', 'ALCS', 'World', 'Series', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'bellyaching', 'alleged', 'missed', 'calls', 'seemed', 'be', 'leaning', 'Houston', 'play-by-play', 'analysis', 'flaws', 'prized', 'collectible', 'White', 'Sox', 'fan', 'should', 'be']",Chicago White Sox: 2005 World Series

961598,A1C9GCHR99WX3F,B000CRR392,Stephen Verhaeren,"[1, 7]","No matter if you have known it all your life, the last time the Chicago White Sox won the World Series was in 1917, and the last time they were in the World Series was 1959, that is until 2005, when the White Sox became the surpise hottest team in the American League, but since the American League team won the All-star game in 05, like they have since the rule, had been put in effect that the side that wins the All-star game will get to have homefield advantage in the World Series, no matter which 2 teams make it. And who would have believed that it would have been the Chicago White Sox and Houston Astros that went up for the championship. This was also the first time the Chicago White Sox made the playoffs since 2000, when they played the Seattle Mariners, and was swept in the first round of the playoffs. The Chicago White Sox met the Boston Red Sox for the ALDS, and I didn't even think the Chicago White Sox will be able to even beat the Red Sox, but they did, and they completed the sweep at Fenway Park in game 3. And then that waited for the winner of the Los Angeles Angles and New York Yankes winner, and it went to where, the winner wasn't even going to get a day off. And the Angles won the series, and for the first time since 2002, there was no Boston Red Sox or New York Yannkees meeting up for the trip to the World Series. The well rested Chicago White Sox lost to the tired Angles (thier only loss in the whole post season). The White Sox won it in 5 games, and now it was down to the St. Louis Cardinals and Hosuston Astros, the Cardinals were bidding farewell to old Busch Stadium, but lost the Astors, and Busch Stadiume was closed, set to be delmoished. This is were he get all 4 games, including the marathon game #3, thqat the White Sox won the game in 5 hours and 41 minutes, long after it hit midnight, and shortly after 1 in the morning. The White Sox copmpleted the sweep later on that night. Games #1 and 2 took place at US Cellular Field in Chicago, and then the scene swifted to Minute Maid Park in Houston for games #3 and 4. Now I woulkd have thought it would have been a perfect farewell to the old Busch Stadium, if the Cardinals and White Sox met up for the World Series, but that didn't happen.",4,It finnaly happened,1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,2241,"['matter', 'have', 'known', 'life', 'last', 'time', 'Chicago', 'White', 'Sox', 'won', 'World', 'Series', 'was', '1917', 'last', 'time', 'were', 'World', 'Series', 'was', '1959', '2005', 'when', 'White', 'Sox', 'became', 'surpise', 'hottest', 'team', 'American', 'League', 'American', 'League', 'team', 'won', 'All-star', 'game', '05', 'have', 'rule', 'had', 'been', 'put', 'effect', 'side', 'All-star', 'game', 'will', 'get', 'have', 'homefield', 'advantage', 'World', 'Series', 'matter', '2', 'teams', 'make', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'believed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Chicago', 'White', 'Sox', 'Houston', 'Astros', 'went', 'up', 'championship', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'Chicago', 'White', 'Sox', 'made', 'playoffs', '2000', 'when', 'played', 'Seattle', 'Mariners', 'was', 'swept', 'first', 'round', 'playoffs', 'Chicago', 'White', 'Sox', 'met', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'ALDS', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'Chicago', 'White', 'Sox', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'even', 'beat', 'Red', 'Sox', 'did', 'completed', 'sweep', 'Fenway', 'Park', 'game', '3', 'then', 'waited', 'winner', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Angles', 'New', 'York', 'Yankes', 'winner', 'went', 'where', 'winner', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'going', 'get', 'day', 'Angles', 'won', 'series', 'first', 'time', '2002', 'was', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'New', 'York', 'Yannkees', 'meeting', 'up', 'trip', 'World', 'Series', 'well', 'rested', 'Chicago', 'White', 'Sox', 'lost', 'tired', 'Angles', 'thier', 'only', 'loss', 'whole', 'post', 'season', 'White', 'Sox', 'won', '5', 'games', 'now', 'was', 'down', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Cardinals', 'Hosuston', 'Astros', 'Cardinals', 'were', 'bidding', 'farewell', 'old', 'Busch', 'Stadium', 'lost', 'Astors', 'Busch', 'Stadiume', 'was', 'closed', 'set', 'be', 'delmoished', 'were', 'get', '4', 'games', 'including', 'marathon', 'game', '3', 'thqat', 'White', 'Sox', 'won', 'game', '5', 'hours', '41', 'minutes', 'long', 'hit', 'midnight', 'shortly', '1', 'morning', 'White', 'Sox', 'copmpleted', 'sweep', 'later', 'night', 'Games', '1', '2', 'took', 'place', 'US', 'Cellular', 'Field', 'Chicago', 'then', 'scene', 'swifted', 'Minute', 'Maid', 'Park', 'Houston', 'games', '3', '4', 'Now', 'woulkd', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'farewell', 'old', 'Busch', 'Stadium', 'Cardinals', 'White', 'Sox', 'met', 'up', 'World', 'Series', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen']",Chicago White Sox: 2005 World Series
