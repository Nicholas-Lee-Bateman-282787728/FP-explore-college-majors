The first episode definitely lived up to this reputation. The other three episodes, though, go into the main character's past. Plenty of time given to the storyline. This is definitely not a volume you want to miss if you want to understand the plot since it shows the very beginning of how Brandon got into his predicament.The reason I didn't give the show five stars is because I'm not a big fan of lengthy flashbacks. I like little bits at a time, not the whole past being laid out all at once. Even at the end of volume 1, the flashback appears it will continue on several more episodes into volume 2. It is still a very interesting show, but there is a major drop in intense action because of this flashback.Still, I'm pretty sure most people will enjoy this DVD with its great animation and sound effects.

822663,A1H7IQM3WMOF11,B00023BN74,"Heather Richards ""darkjediqueen""","[6, 8]","I wasn't sure what to expect with Gungrave. Anime made from video games is notorious for having less than engaging plot lines. Yet I was pleasantly surprised by Gungrave, a video game adaption that works as an anime very well.The action starts in the middle, with a massive gunman in a cowboy hat and gothic wardrobe coming to life and wiping out creatures attacking him and a young woman and scientist living in a van. The scientist tells the young woman, Mika, to refer to the man as Beyond the Grave since he is no longer the person he was in life, Brandon Heat, a man in love with Mika's mother long ago. Grave can clean up and apparently doesn't talk, though Brandon rarely talked either, so that's probably not all that odd. All this happens in the first episode, leaving the next three to be flashbacks of Brandon's younger days when he was best friends with Harry Macdowell, now the crime lord of the city, and when he was in love with Maria, who has been murdered apparently after Brandon himself was. It seems that Brandon was a Sweeper for the mob in his younger years, a person responsible for cleaning up the mafia's messes when needed. He is also referred to as being the best Sweeper there ever was, something the fashbacks haven't gotten to thus far.Brandon and Grave, since they're one in the same, are good guys. They might fight to survive and be good at that, but they're kind people and very loyal and don't seem to be wild about the violence, at least Brandon doesn't since Grave seems to not have a care in the world about killing the bad guys. Brandon is the driving force of the series, it's his story, which is a little odd since he says all of six sentences in the entire four episodes. He's a man of very few words apparently. While the series is made to deal with Grave trying to save Mika, there is really little known about that plot line and more emphasis on Brandon as a young man leading to his betrayal by his best friend.The series is great to look at, as should be expected from the creators of Trigun. Grave is an entirely new look for a main character, with the goth cowboy gear. The main problem is that Brandon *doesn't* talk, even when it seems he should. Other characters ask him questions and all he'll do is nod or look at them. Grave himself doesn't talk at all. We hear some internal monologue from the characters, but Brandon/Grave just doesn't talk except for a few isolated incedents, which makes you wonder how he every won over Maria, even though he obviously loves her and he's obviously handsome. There was also a very small amount of Grave, considering the series is called Gungrave. Hopefully the back story will be over soon and Grave will become the main character again.Gungrave is a good series is spite of all that. It's interesting and Grave is a wonderfully unique character. It's possibly the best series based on a video game.",4,Beyond the Grave,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,2891,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'Gungrave', 'Anime', 'made', 'video', 'games', 'notorious', 'having', 'less', 'engaging', 'plot', 'lines', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Gungrave', 'video', 'game', 'adaption', 'anime', 'very', 'well.The', 'action', 'middle', 'massive', 'gunman', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'gothic', 'wardrobe', 'coming', 'life', 'wiping', 'out', 'creatures', 'attacking', 'young', 'woman', 'scientist', 'living', 'van', 'scientist', 'young', 'woman', 'Mika', 'refer', 'man', 'Beyond', 'Grave', 'no', 'longer', 'person', 'was', 'life', 'Brandon', 'Heat', 'man', 'love', 'Mika', 'mother', 'long', 'ago', 'Grave', 'can', 'clean', 'up', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'talk', 'Brandon', 'rarely', 'talked', 'probably', 'not', 'odd', 'first', 'episode', 'leaving', 'next', 'three', 'be', 'flashbacks', 'Brandon', 'younger', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'best', 'friends', 'Harry', 'Macdowell', 'now', 'crime', 'lord', 'city', 'when', 'was', 'love', 'Maria', 'who', 'been', 'murdered', 'apparently', 'Brandon', 'was', 'Brandon', 'was', 'Sweeper', 'mob', 'younger', 'years', 'person', 'responsible', 'cleaning', 'up', 'mafia', 'messes', 'when', 'needed', 'also', 'referred', 'being', 'best', 'Sweeper', 'ever', 'was', 'something', 'fashbacks', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'thus', 'far.Brandon', 'Grave', ""'re"", 'one', 'same', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'might', 'fight', 'survive', 'be', 'good', ""'re"", 'kind', 'people', 'very', 'loyal', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'wild', 'violence', 'least', 'Brandon', ""n't"", 'Grave', 'not', 'have', 'care', 'world', 'killing', 'bad', 'guys', 'Brandon', 'driving', 'force', 'series', 'story', 'little', 'odd', 'six', 'sentences', 'entire', 'four', 'episodes', 'man', 'very', 'few', 'words', 'apparently', 'series', 'made', 'deal', 'Grave', 'trying', 'save', 'Mika', 'really', 'little', 'known', 'plot', 'line', 'more', 'emphasis', 'Brandon', 'young', 'man', 'leading', 'betrayal', 'best', 'friend.The', 'series', 'great', 'look', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'creators', 'Trigun', 'Grave', 'entirely', 'new', 'look', 'main', 'character', 'goth', 'cowboy', 'gear', 'main', 'problem', 'Brandon', ""*doesn't*"", 'talk', 'even', 'when', 'should', 'Other', 'characters', 'ask', 'questions', ""'ll"", 'do', 'nod', 'look', 'Grave', ""n't"", 'talk', 'hear', 'internal', 'monologue', 'characters', 'Brandon/Grave', 'just', ""n't"", 'talk', 'few', 'isolated', 'incedents', 'wonder', 'how', 'won', 'Maria', 'even', 'obviously', 'obviously', 'handsome', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'small', 'amount', 'Grave', 'considering', 'series', 'called', 'Gungrave', 'Hopefully', 'back', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'soon', 'Grave', 'will', 'become', 'main', 'character', 'again.Gungrave', 'good', 'series', 'spite', 'interesting', 'Grave', 'wonderfully', 'unique', 'character', 'possibly', 'best', 'series', 'based', 'video', 'game']",Gungrave: Beyond the Grave - Volume 1

822666,A25O0GQIBO4VHH,B00023BN74,Seppo Helava,"[5, 15]","I was psyched for Gungrave, largely because I really enjoyed the anime segments of the videogame. The character design and atmosphere was phenomenal, and despite there being less than twenty minutes of total anime sequences in the game, it was obvious that this could have been translated into a stunning miniseries.Imagine my surprise when this first disc fell flat on its face.Where to begin? The writing is completely overwrought, and so melodramatic it removes any potential that one might actually relate to the characters. Brandon Heat is nearly mute, to the point where it becomes quite irritating. The visual style is different than the game, which though obviously for technical reasons, is inferior in every way.The first episode is the only episode where the character is &quot;Beyond the Grave&quot; - the unstoppable main character of the videogame. In the remaining three episodes, it tells his origin, as an aimless street punk named Brandon. The problem with this is that Brandon is a nearly mute yutz. He can apparently fight well enough, but beyond that there's no reason to care about him, or his other stereotypical friends.The main problem with the anime is that the game was fundamentally about style. Whether it was the main character striking a pose, or wading through your enemies with unlimited ammo, Gungrave made its mark because it had a unique style. The anime is completely devoid of anything even remotely approaching the quality of the anime contained in the game. If you want a Gungrave anime series, I'd suggest you play the game, then imagine what *you* would do with an anime series based on the same subject matter. I have no doubt that whatever you're thinking, it's better than what's on this disc.",1,The quality of the anime in the game is better.

O'Blenis,"[2, 2]","The first of the ""Gungrave"" series starts out in the not-too distant future, a world that appears to be right on the cusp of a dawning new age where science has brought forth monsters and virtually unstoppable cyborgs.  A lone scientist, a teenage girl, and an early cyborg prototype - who's first activation is in the opening moments of the disc's first episode - are on the run from a vastly powerful and utterly ruthless organization which seems to be at the heart of the upcoming chaos.  It succeeds in having its characters make an instant impression that you'll want to care about them, and offers the kind of stunning, monsterous action (with stunning sound) that will appeal to all horror and action fans.Then everything changes.  With the story barely begun and everything still very enigmatic we're suddenly back over a decade in the past starting with the 2nd episode, in a time that's apparantly the present, to witness how it all begins.  Having not Yet seen the rest of the series (they're definately on my must-see list) I can only assume that the series is going to follow the characters through the years, eventually 'catch up' with that first episode, and then move on from there.The story the subsequent episodes on ""Gungrave Volume 1"" tells is of a modern-day city where smalltime teenage criminal gangs operate under a loose series of what I guess you'd call supervisors, who in turn answer to the mafia (a mafia that has its hand deep into all the cutting-edge sciences).  The thing is, if I'd known that this was the focus of ""Beyond The Grave"" I probably never would have rented it, but I found myself drawn into it very deeply.  It's well done and while most of the teenage criminal element seem to be just scum, plain and simple, there are characters among them who are surprisingly likable, possessed of the kind of nature that one would not expect to find them living their lives as small-time mob minions.  I'm actually hoping the series goes back a little as well as forward and shows how some of these characters wound up where they are at episode 2's beginning.  Instantly likable is the young (and non gang member) girl, Maria I believe her name was who shares a mutual attraction with one of the smalltimers that her father is trying very hard to discourage.Not what I expected to get but none the worse for it; this is just the kind of movie that shows that one should vary from their more frequent paths every now and then because you never know when you'll be really blown away by a kind of movie you haven't had much prior experience with.
