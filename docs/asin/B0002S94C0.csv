844552,A8AD6PLQ0PPQE,B0002S94C0,"Anonymous ""booksandcookies""","[0, 0]","First, others might make this mistake, as I did:  this was apparently a mini-series or made for TV movie.  I did not know that and thought it was a theatrical release movie. That matters because the movie is long and has very brief breaks where TV breaks apparently would have appeared in its original use. In addition, because it is a TV movie/mini-series, it is not rated. I did not notice that either before purchasing. If it were to be shown in a theatre, it might be rated ""R"" because there are some scenes of violence and sexual activity, as well as drug references, corruption of judicial/law enforcement officials and so on.  I thought the relationship between William Macy's character and Felicity Huffman's character was interesting and complex and the performances of those two actors was excellent. I also thought the actors playing Romeo ""Squirrel"" Gandalf, played by Mr. Plummer, and Farell Collins (please forgive any misspelling of characters' or actors' names), played by Mr. Moore were excellent. I didn't care for the casting of the character ""Muriel Wynn"" at all. So many close-ups of her face looking like Bambi in the headlights or of her dressed in very low-cut or short-skirted clothing did not ring true for a D.A., even a novice one, and especially one engaged in a highly sexual affair didn't square with the ""pure and innocent"" face. I kept seeing a Marilyn Monroe kind of figure playing a tough D.A. and it didn't work. I did not like the relationship she had with her husband, nor his very controlling, unloving demeanor with her and wondered what anyone would wonder:  why would she ever be with that guy when Tom Selleck was waiting for her?! Tom Selleck is always Tom Selleck in whatever role he plays, and that is actually fine with me. However, because that is his persona, it is the same one he played in, for example, Magnum P.I. and I love him in his roles but one always waits for the sly, funny quip, the sarcastic joke and so on.  In this movie, his tender feelings for the female D.A. show on his face, in his eyes, so his acting ability is more nuanced than may be usually associated with him. I think he is an actor whom people feel great affection for and who might be underrated in the ""great actor"" assessments; he is like Clark Gable, Cary Grant, and the like, actors who have a strong screen presence and identifiable persona and whose very presence in a production makes the production appealing. I titled this review ""Complex or convoluted"" because the key event in the movie is seen and portrayed from several different perspectives and thus is shown several times.

I recently reviewed his non-fiction book about the death penalty, ""Ultimate Punishment.""The only really recognizable face in this movie is Tom Sellack, who plays detective Larry Starczek. One that kept haunting me is a fairly minor character named Collins Farwell is played by Shemar Moore. I knew I'd seen him somewhere before, and pretty sure he played a cop, but it was not until I looked this movie up on IMDB that I realized he was Detective Derek Morgan in the TV series, ""Criminal Minds.""What we know at the outset of this film is that three people were murdered in a diner, a woman and two men. A rather flimsy trail of evidence leads Starczek to a fence named Squirrel Gandalf (Glenn Plummer), and when Starczek confronts him, he admits he doesn't know whether he did it or not. He was just that stoned. Starczek convinces him that he did, and he confesses.Remember, this is just the beginning, not the end. He is sentenced to death, but when the appeals procedure gets down to the wire after seven years, the court appoints a successful corporate attorney named Arthur Raven (William H. Macy) to represent him. As Mr. Raven digs into the facts of the case, it becomes clear that there were a lot of problems with Squirrel's conviction.There are a couple of love stories complicating the issue here, one that was supposedly over long ago, and one that took both of the participants by surprise. I will say no more, except that the love stories are so well woven into the criminal investigation and court case that they are indeed relevant to the story, and indeed relevant to the outcome of the appeal.And I'm not going to tell you that, either.",4,For Those Who Care About Justice,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1756,"['Scott', 'Turow', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', ""'ve"", 'read', 'several', 'books', 'mostly', 'while', 'ago', 'recently', 'reviewed', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'death', 'penalty', 'Ultimate', 'Punishment', 'only', 'really', 'recognizable', 'face', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Sellack', 'who', 'detective', 'Larry', 'Starczek', 'One', 'kept', 'haunting', 'fairly', 'minor', 'character', 'named', 'Collins', 'Farwell', 'played', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'knew', ""'d"", 'seen', 'somewhere', 'before', 'pretty', 'sure', 'played', 'cop', 'was', 'not', 'looked', 'movie', 'up', 'IMDB', 'realized', 'was', 'Detective', 'Derek', 'Morgan', 'TV', 'series', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'What', 'know', 'outset', 'film', 'three', 'people', 'were', 'murdered', 'diner', 'woman', 'two', 'men', 'rather', 'flimsy', 'trail', 'evidence', 'leads', 'Starczek', 'fence', 'named', 'Squirrel', 'Gandalf', 'Glenn', 'Plummer', 'when', 'Starczek', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'just', 'stoned', 'Starczek', 'did', 'confesses.Remember', 'just', 'beginning', 'not', 'end', 'sentenced', 'death', 'when', 'appeals', 'procedure', 'down', 'wire', 'seven', 'years', 'court', 'successful', 'corporate', 'attorney', 'named', 'Arthur', 'Raven', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'represent', 'Mr.', 'Raven', 'facts', 'case', 'clear', 'were', 'lot', 'problems', 'Squirrel', 'conviction.There', 'are', 'couple', 'love', 'stories', 'complicating', 'issue', 'here', 'one', 'was', 'supposedly', 'long', 'ago', 'one', 'took', 'participants', 'surprise', 'will', 'say', 'more', 'love', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'woven', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'court', 'case', 'are', 'indeed', 'relevant', 'story', 'indeed', 'relevant', 'outcome', 'appeal.And', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell']",Reversible Errors

844558,AFVROUVTT63XM,B0002S94C0,"Dr. H. A. Jones ""Howard Jones""","[0, 0]","This is a film based on a book by Scott Turow. The film runs to nearly three hours, which you need to cover all the twists and turns in the story, right up to the closing minutes. Let me see if I can summarize the main points. The story opens with a dispute in a caf&eacute;-bar, the Paradise diner, as a result of which three people are killed, including the caf&eacute; owner, Gus Leonidas (Gerry Mendicino). Sergeant Larry Starczek (Tom Selleck) is called in while he was in the middle of making love to prosecuting attorney Muriel Wynn (Monica Potter) - so she gets involved in the case too at the ouset. Another of the three victims is Louisa Remardi (Christina Collins) who works for airline boss Erno Erdai (James Rebhorn). This prompts a visit from Starczek and Erdai sends Starczek after his nephew, a jailbird called Collins Farwell (Shemar Moore). He in turn sets up a black petty thief called Romeo `Squirrel' Gandolph (Glenn Plummer), a man of somewhat limited intelligence and therefore an easy patsy. Starzeck gets Squirrel to confess and he is convicted by Judge Gillian Sullivan (Felicity Huffman) and sentenced to death.The scene now moves to 7 years later when Squirrel is facing his last appeal before the death sentence is carried out, and many new facts appear. Arthur Raven (William H. Macy), a friend of Wynn's in the prosecutor's office, now takes over Squirrel's defence, pro bono. In the interval, Judge Sullivan has been disbarred and imprisoned for taking bribes. Other people now in turn become the prime suspects for the Paradise diner murders. The twists in the story are fascinating and Perry Mason fans will find the story engrossing, even though there are no car chases and no more bodies. The acting by the principals is convincing and I couldn't believe that nearly three hours had gone by since we started. Tom Selleck portrays Starczek with much the same personality as he does Robert Palmer's Jesse Stone.Jesse Stone: Innocents LostJesse Stone: Thin IceJesse Stone: No Remorse",5,Another Tom Selleck thriller,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,2016,"['film', 'based', 'book', 'Scott', 'Turow', 'film', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'need', 'cover', 'twists', 'turns', 'story', 'right', 'up', 'closing', 'minutes', 'Let', 'see', 'can', 'summarize', 'main', 'points', 'story', 'dispute', 'caf', 'eacute', 'Paradise', 'diner', 'result', 'three', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'including', 'caf', 'eacute', 'owner', 'Gus', 'Leonidas', 'Gerry', 'Mendicino', 'Sergeant', 'Larry', 'Starczek', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'called', 'was', 'middle', 'making', 'love', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'Muriel', 'Wynn', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'involved', 'case', 'too', 'ouset', 'three', 'victims', 'Louisa', 'Remardi', 'Christina', 'Collins', 'who', 'airline', 'boss', 'Erno', 'Erdai', 'James', 'Rebhorn', 'visit', 'Starczek', 'Erdai', 'Starczek', 'nephew', 'jailbird', 'called', 'Collins', 'Farwell', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'turn', 'up', 'black', 'petty', 'thief', 'called', 'Romeo', 'Squirrel', 'Gandolph', 'Glenn', 'Plummer', 'man', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'intelligence', 'therefore', 'easy', 'patsy', 'Starzeck', 'Squirrel', 'confess', 'convicted', 'Judge', 'Gillian', 'Sullivan', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'sentenced', 'death.The', 'scene', 'now', '7', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'Squirrel', 'facing', 'last', 'appeal', 'death', 'sentence', 'carried', 'many', 'new', 'facts', 'appear', 'Arthur', 'Raven', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'friend', 'Wynn', 'prosecutor', 'office', 'now', 'Squirrel', 'defence', 'pro', 'bono', 'interval', 'Judge', 'Sullivan', 'been', 'disbarred', 'imprisoned', 'taking', 'bribes', 'Other', 'people', 'now', 'turn', 'become', 'prime', 'suspects', 'Paradise', 'diner', 'murders', 'twists', 'story', 'are', 'fascinating', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'story', 'engrossing', 'even', 'are', 'car', 'chases', 'more', 'bodies', 'acting', 'principals', 'convincing', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'had', 'gone', 'started', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'Starczek', 'much', 'same', 'personality', 'Robert', 'Palmer', 'Jesse', 'Stone.Jesse', 'Stone', 'Innocents', 'LostJesse', 'Stone', 'Thin', 'IceJesse', 'Stone', 'Remorse']",Reversible Errors

This film may show the legal profession in it's true colors, but those colors aren't bad to look at.  Death penalty cases are certainly never dull...come on, a man's life is on the line after all.  William H. Macy leads the cast as an attorney originally tasked with handling the appeal of a condemned killer but eventually comes to believe that there may be something to his client's claims of innocence.  On the other side is Tom Selleck, perfectly playing the detective who had cracked the case and gotten the vital confession from the convict, and Monica Potter, the prosicuter who successfully won a conviction and got the death penalty for the convicted murderer.  Felicity Huffman, Mr. Macy's real-life wife, plays his love interest and the judge who presided over the murder trial before being disgraced and thrown off the bench.  Glenn Plummer convincingly plays the condemned man claiming his innocence and James Rebhorn is great as the man who may hold the truth somewhere in his head...to bad he's dying of cancer or there wouldn't be such a ticking clock.  Though this film is a television miniseriesturned into a film for it's DVD release, it's definetly worth watching (make sure you have plenty of time to do so), living up to it's source material, the novel of the same name written by Scott Turow.

(He's a cop)  I thought the plot weak and nothing much original in the way of acting emerged either - but that's just me being critical.A spastic street hobo with an astonishing tic that affects both eyes,  provides an easy mark to pin a murder on because he says anything that comes into his mind without bothering to explain it, and is given the ultimate penalty quickly.  Case Closed.  Enter another attorney who picks up on a few discrepant details, and decides to reopen.  Selleck and his love interest, who is an attorney, want to keep the verdict intact for a variety of reasons that benefit them both, while the other attorney ( William H. Macy, who turns in the best performance, in my view  ) listens to the story and sees a possible miscarriage of justice.  He is depressed over the loss of his sister, and is barely able to function on a traffic ticket case, let alone capital punishment makeover, but he decides to give it a go, supported by a disgraced female judge who is drawn into it through something she knows.Two sessions of sheet action (discreetly muted) and heavy breathing from Selleck and his female attorney friend are intended to thrill the viewer, interspersed by long periods of sexual tension, which doesn't.Oh, and it involves airline ticket skimming too, and clear to the top.If you're just in the mood for simple entertainment, go for it, it's not that bad.
