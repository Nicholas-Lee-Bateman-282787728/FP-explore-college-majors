The show, for the most part, keeps getting better and better... it started airing about 13 years ago (there are huge gaps between the seasons, hence why it's only on season 8) and they've just continued to progress, impress, and evolve the show; how it delivers humor, how the stories link up, and what it all means. This is brilliant humor, but it's also daring humor.Some people miss Cheryl, some people don't like the new NY locales, some people aren't fans of the writing. But I honestly think this is the single all-around FUNNIEST season (and may end up being one of the best seasons overall when reflected upon later; it'll be hard to top season 3, though).  I am glad I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews.

I've watched every season and, if anything, it is better than Seinfeld. This is because with Larry there are no holds barred.  He is the whole comic all on his own who shines even brighter with a supporting cast but really needs no comic foil. I enjoyed Cheryl Hines when she was on playing his wife but Larry is more believable as a single guy.This season has so many funny moments that it would be an impossible task to recount them all. There is one where Larry's big thing becomes that he has to have a Jewish divorce lawyer. And he talks an LA team owner into doing the same.  So they both drop a top notch divorce lawyer and get a Jewish incompetent to represent them for predictable results. People really do silly things like this when choosing lawyers so it couldn't be any more spot on.Larry also has a superb feud with Michael J. Fox that is just brilliant.  Larry is rarely bested but here he is up against a disabled philanthropist who is slyly thinking up things by the moment to drive Larry crazy.  And does he ever!Larry's black roommate is, as always, hilarious.  The two of them together is always top flight.  There is one episode where they are mistakenly taken for a gay couple which is hilarious.  But they always end up together, whether in LA, NYC or even Paris! It's almost too bad they aren't gay as they are perfect for one another.Suzie is her foul mouthed best every time she appears onscreen.  jeff is his usual obnoxious self. Richard Lewis and Larry make their usual odd couple pairing as well.  They have been friends in real life since summer camp as kids but it is always a relationship in turmoil.  They wouldn't have it any other way either. This time Larry manages to convince Richard's new girlfriend to get a breast reduction operation when the main reason Richard likes her is because she has huge breasts!",5,Larry Can Hold His Own; no Foil Needed,1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,1915,"['was', 'huge', 'Seinfeld', 'fan', 'never', 'expected', 'like', 'CURB', 'much', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'season', 'anything', 'better', 'Seinfeld', 'Larry', 'are', 'barred', 'whole', 'comic', 'own', 'who', 'even', 'brighter', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'comic', 'foil', 'enjoyed', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'when', 'was', 'playing', 'wife', 'Larry', 'more', 'believable', 'single', 'guy.This', 'season', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'task', 'recount', 'one', 'where', 'Larry', 'big', 'thing', 'have', 'Jewish', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'LA', 'team', 'owner', 'doing', 'same', 'drop', 'top', 'notch', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'get', 'Jewish', 'incompetent', 'represent', 'predictable', 'results', 'People', 'really', 'do', 'silly', 'things', 'when', 'choosing', 'lawyers', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'spot', 'on.Larry', 'also', 'superb', 'feud', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'just', 'brilliant', 'Larry', 'rarely', 'bested', 'here', 'up', 'disabled', 'philanthropist', 'who', 'slyly', 'thinking', 'up', 'things', 'moment', 'drive', 'Larry', 'crazy', 'ever', 'Larry', 'black', 'roommate', 'always', 'hilarious', 'two', 'together', 'always', 'top', 'flight', 'one', 'episode', 'where', 'are', 'mistakenly', 'taken', 'gay', 'couple', 'hilarious', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'LA', 'NYC', 'even', 'Paris', 'almost', 'too', 'bad', 'are', ""n't"", 'gay', 'are', 'perfect', 'one', 'another.Suzie', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'best', 'time', 'onscreen', 'jeff', 'usual', 'obnoxious', 'self', 'Richard', 'Lewis', 'Larry', 'make', 'usual', 'odd', 'couple', 'pairing', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'real', 'life', 'summer', 'camp', 'kids', 'always', 'relationship', 'turmoil', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'way', 'time', 'Larry', 'convince', 'Richard', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'get', 'breast', 'reduction', 'operation', 'when', 'main', 'reason', 'Richard', 'huge', 'breasts']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 8

In fact, this one is much more ""pure Larry David""-- without the unnecessary embellishments and artifices that only detract from the basic humor that attracts intelligent viewers.  I do believe, however, that the recurring character, ""Tessler"", has outlived his usefulness.  In addition, there is a very real problem incorporating guest stars that don't really fit in with overall style of the show. In particular, the appearances of Ricky Gervais and Rosie O'Donnell come across as kind of awkward, forced and unnatural. Michael J. Fox, however, is much more natural and believable.

It also helps that he is such a funny and I dare say an iconic actor/comedian. I admit I was skeptical about ordering this dvd because I honestly didn't think the previous season (with the Seinfeld reunion) was that funny. I guess most all shows are bound to hit a lull and it seemed that is what happened with Curb. However, I just marathon-watched the first dvd of season 8 (there are 2 dvds- eps 1-7 on the first dvd and 8-10 I believe on the second) and each episode has been hilarious, causing me to laugh out loud at Larry's misfortunes. His manager Jeff is also incredibly funny as a supporting character, as is his friend Richard Lewis. These episodes remind me of the brilliance of the first few seasons when the show was absolutely the funniest show on television. I also kind of like his sidekick Leon but I could do without Leon's continuous use of profanity- every other syllable out of his mouth is the f-word. One problem that I have noticed with this dvd though is the audio track is off in several spots within some of the episodes. It's a little distracting but not too big a deal. The price of this dvd is pretty good- marked down from like $30 to $16. This season does not disappoint- the show is brilliant and Larry David is so funny.

Not only is the material hilarious, but it also has a little dark humor to it.  Like Seinfeld, the whole show is pretty much about ""nothing.""  It's just about people getting wrapped up in silly, trivial issues every day, and is kind of a parody of life itself.  When asked where the title of the show came from, Larry's response was: ""It reflects my perception that many people seem to live their lives projecting false enthusiasm, which I believes is used to imply that ""they are better than you.""Do I miss Cheryl?  Yes, I do.  I would have chosen to keep her in the cast, but her departure opened up a lot more opportunities to put Larry in hilarious and awkward situations with women.  And Larry is the same as he is with women as he is with everyone else - he acts just like Larry.  Leon is a great part of the cast - he's very ""Krameresque"" with his constant following of Larry wherever he goes and mooches off of him, but he says the most funny, silly, random things.I have all seven seasons so far, and can't wait to add this to my collection!  The replay value is great.  I go through them about once a year and I still laugh as hard as ever.

1352565,A3LMVQ8BTEL4VY,B003L77GMO,Leonard Kirke,"[0, 0]","&#34;Curb Your Enthusiasm&#34; is part of a genre I like to call &#34;painful comedy.&#34; It's incredibly funny; it's laugh out loud, laugh-until-you-almost-pass-out funny. But it is also very, very painful to watch. It takes the social awkwardness and comedy of errors that was Larry David's previous series, &#34;Seinfeld,&#34; and cranks them up to the max.You can't help but sympathize with Larry and often some of the more innocent bystanders that exist in his world. The situations he's constantly finding himself in are hysterical, but you have to cringe in-between laughing. I often watch this with family and we find that we have to &#34;take breaks&#34; very often. While we have been known to watch &#34;Seinfeld&#34; on a regular basis for months on end, we're more likely to only watch &#34;Curb Your Enthusiasm&#34; once every few months as it is, frankly, emotionally exhausting, if you watch with any amount of emotional investment.Season Eight continues the same level of high-quality writing and improv seen in all the earlier seasons. In this particular story arc, Larry travels to New York, which is an interesting creative choice, as it puts Larry back on his home turf (both the fictionalized Larry of the show and the real Larry). Michael J. Fox has a guest appearance, and it's wonderful guest spot indeed (and yes, Parkinson's Disease forms the basis of a joke and yes, it is funny). Thankfully, too, Larry's long-time roommate Leon, played to perfection by J.B. Smoove, is along for the trip to New York City. Leon is my favorite character on the show, and I hope he remains as a major part of the cast for the rest of the series' run (and heck, why doesn't Smoove have his own show yet?).The DVD set comes in the same form it has before for pretty much every other season. Special features includes &#34;Leon's Guide to NYC,&#34; which is maybe not as funny as J.B. Smoove's usual work (perhaps because he doesn't have any other actors or situations to play off of) but still good for a chuckle, and a really fascinating discussion of the show with the main cast (Jeff's comments comparing the appeal of &#34;Curb Your Enthusiasm&#34; to Pixar films was especially enlightening and memorable).The improv-style performances of the show continue to prove that with the right actors and outline writers, a script isn't even necessary. If you're a fan of &#34;Seinfeld&#34; or previous seasons of the show, then I think you're going to love this DVD set.It's pretty good.

Although this is not the greatest season, it is not the worst either. It is an average season. When Curb has been as good as it has been at times, this season may not seem like enough for some people. Yet overall it is above average Curb and shows Larry David could keep this going if he wanted to.Season 8 is a mixture of old and new Curb in that there are some familiar routines repeated in different settings and production techniques have been tightened up, this time successfully in most cases. Larry David's maxim, ""If it is scripted it isn't funny"" proved itself out in Season 7's completely fake Seinfeld reunion rehearsals with the crew laughing as the cast read the script. I also thought this proved to be true when Larry did the Mel Brooks Broadway play with all of the shots of people laughing in an earlier season. It is not merely shots of people faking a laugh it is the serious attempt at making something appear funny that isn't. Both cases didn't warrant laughs and went against the grain of LD's adage.In the beginning Curb was filmed with most actors on camera having just a hint of the topic and left to react naturally to what unfolded. Scenes often involved everyone delivering their lines in one continuous shot. In later seasons LD has relied more on written dialog and editing with each actor delivering separately filmed lines. Until this season the editing had been awkward. It seemed to start as a band-aid revealing the flubs and discomfort that prompted the need to abandon the spontaneity of the earlier approach. In Season 8 this has been successfully tightened up. Perhaps they changed the objective. Use separate takes to build a good scene rather than to repair bad takes. Many scenes work and best of all they are funny most of the time as well.Jeff Garlin has always been one of the regulars who appears comfortable and manages to be funny under Curb's spontaneous style. Fortunately he is back and included in every episode. J.D. Smoove (Leon Black) has been a great addition as a regular and he follows Larry through the last episode this season. There is very little of Cheryl Hines and Richard Lewis (he has never been more enjoyable than in Curb, IMO). Oddly, Curb veteran Susie Essman is one of the most awkward with the Curb style this season. Missing is Ted Danson another who has been very good. Jeff, Cheryl and Larry have not aged a day since the series began.With a few minor caveats Season 8 is a good season, not the greatest and not the worst.",4,Better than Season 7 hope for 9+,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,2628,"['did', 'not', 'set', 'expectations', 'high', 'Season', '8', 'was', 'not', 'satisfied', 'Season', '7', 'However', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'not', 'greatest', 'season', 'not', 'worst', 'either', 'average', 'season', 'When', 'Curb', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'been', 'times', 'season', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'enough', 'people', 'overall', 'above', 'average', 'Curb', 'Larry', 'David', 'could', 'keep', 'going', 'wanted', 'to.Season', '8', 'mixture', 'old', 'new', 'Curb', 'are', 'familiar', 'routines', 'repeated', 'different', 'settings', 'production', 'techniques', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'up', 'time', 'successfully', 'most', 'cases', 'Larry', 'David', 'maxim', 'scripted', ""n't"", 'funny', 'proved', 'out', 'Season', '7', 'completely', 'fake', 'Seinfeld', 'reunion', 'rehearsals', 'crew', 'laughing', 'cast', 'read', 'script', 'also', 'thought', 'proved', 'be', 'true', 'when', 'Larry', 'did', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Broadway', 'play', 'shots', 'people', 'laughing', 'earlier', 'season', 'not', 'merely', 'shots', 'people', 'faking', 'laugh', 'serious', 'attempt', 'making', 'something', 'appear', 'funny', ""n't"", 'cases', 'did', ""n't"", 'warrant', 'laughs', 'went', 'grain', 'LD', 'adage.In', 'beginning', 'Curb', 'was', 'filmed', 'most', 'actors', 'camera', 'having', 'just', 'hint', 'topic', 'left', 'react', 'naturally', 'what', 'unfolded', 'Scenes', 'often', 'involved', 'everyone', 'delivering', 'lines', 'one', 'continuous', 'shot', 'later', 'seasons', 'LD', 'relied', 'more', 'written', 'dialog', 'editing', 'actor', 'delivering', 'separately', 'filmed', 'lines', 'season', 'editing', 'had', 'been', 'awkward', 'seemed', 'start', 'band-aid', 'revealing', 'flubs', 'discomfort', 'prompted', 'need', 'abandon', 'spontaneity', 'earlier', 'approach', 'Season', '8', 'been', 'successfully', 'tightened', 'up', 'Perhaps', 'changed', 'objective', 'Use', 'separate', 'build', 'good', 'scene', 'rather', 'repair', 'bad', 'Many', 'scenes', 'work', 'best', 'are', 'funny', 'most', 'time', 'well.Jeff', 'Garlin', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'regulars', 'who', 'comfortable', 'be', 'funny', 'Curb', 'spontaneous', 'style', 'Fortunately', 'back', 'included', 'episode', 'J.D', 'Smoove', 'Leon', 'Black', 'been', 'great', 'addition', 'regular', 'Larry', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'very', 'little', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'Richard', 'Lewis', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Curb', 'IMO', 'Oddly', 'Curb', 'veteran', 'Susie', 'Essman', 'one', 'most', 'awkward', 'Curb', 'style', 'season', 'Missing', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'who', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'Jeff', 'Cheryl', 'Larry', 'have', 'not', 'aged', 'day', 'series', 'few', 'minor', 'caveats', 'Season', '8', 'good', 'season', 'not', 'greatest', 'not', 'worst']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 8
