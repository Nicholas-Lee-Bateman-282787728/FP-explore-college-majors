The moody landscape views are the best thing about it imo. There's a sense of fascination with Ireland and with Irish music. It was like seeing my own place through new eyes.The story follows a decent enough emotional trajectory, for the main character at least. But as others have mentioned there's a huge plot hole in the way the Garda&iacute; supposedly dealt with a death that clearly should have been highly suspicious. An American tourist's body washes up on the shore, battered and half-naked, and the response seems to have been a collective shrug. Ah sure... you know how it is with these young ones.Note to future American scriptwriters purporting to write authentic Irish dialogue: To bring someone from A to B in your car is to give them 'a lift'. Not 'a ride'. A ride here is something else entirely, and no Irishman who values his facial features will  ask a strange woman if they need 'a ride' in his car. Also, here nobody drowns in 'the ocean'. We know the word but never use it. It's 'the sea', folks. And then there's the elderly man with the heavy Kerry accent talking about his son who, unaccountably, has a sharp Northern accent. What's that about? But admittedly, everything I've mentioned in this paragraph is something that might bother a native but would probably sail right past an international audience.I saw the final twist coming, but I'd still give a lot of credit for how well it was portrayed and acted. If the film was in danger of drowning in its own melancholy landscapes at times, the final scenes sent it out on a good strong narrative punch.A good effort, overall. Different, and worth a look.",3,An Irish perspective,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,1722,"['Just', 'watched', 'rainy', 'Saturday', 'fire', 'found', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'indeed', 'moody', 'landscape', 'views', 'are', 'best', 'thing', 'sense', 'fascination', 'Ireland', 'Irish', 'music', 'was', 'seeing', 'own', 'place', 'new', 'eyes.The', 'story', 'decent', 'enough', 'emotional', 'trajectory', 'main', 'character', 'least', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'huge', 'plot', 'hole', 'way', 'Garda', 'iacute', 'supposedly', 'death', 'clearly', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'highly', 'suspicious', 'American', 'tourist', 'body', 'up', 'shore', 'battered', 'half-naked', 'response', 'have', 'been', 'collective', 'shrug', 'Ah', 'sure', 'know', 'how', 'young', 'ones.Note', 'future', 'American', 'scriptwriters', 'purporting', 'write', 'authentic', 'Irish', 'dialogue', 'bring', 'someone', 'A', 'B', 'car', 'give', 'lift', 'Not', 'ride', 'ride', 'here', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'Irishman', 'who', 'facial', 'features', 'will', 'ask', 'strange', 'woman', 'need', 'ride', 'car', 'Also', 'here', 'nobody', 'drowns', ""'the"", 'ocean', 'know', 'word', 'never', 'use', ""'the"", 'sea', 'folks', 'then', 'elderly', 'man', 'heavy', 'Kerry', 'accent', 'talking', 'son', 'who', 'unaccountably', 'sharp', 'Northern', 'accent', 'What', 'admittedly', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'paragraph', 'something', 'might', 'bother', 'native', 'would', 'probably', 'sail', 'right', 'international', 'audience.I', 'saw', 'final', 'twist', 'coming', ""'d"", 'still', 'give', 'lot', 'credit', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'portrayed', 'acted', 'film', 'was', 'danger', 'drowning', 'own', 'melancholy', 'landscapes', 'times', 'final', 'scenes', 'sent', 'out', 'good', 'strong', 'narrative', 'punch.A', 'good', 'effort', 'overall', 'Different', 'look']",Truth About Kerry

Stana is terrific in Castle and everything I've seen her in previously, but this movie was poorly written, a terrible script and generally a disappointment.  I regret having to be so negative, but even the &#34;surprise&#34; ending couldn't save a bad script and I guessed who had killed Kerry about midway through the movie.  I only recognized Stana in her first scene by her smile, walk and voice.  Her look in the movie was rather distracting.

Sheep grazing on the mountain and everything!)Emma decides at the last minute to not join her best friend Kerry on a trip to Ireland.  While there, Kerry washes up on the beach dead.Emma travels to the country to try and find out what really happened to her. She feels that the police did not do enough.This movie rolls right along with you gaining some knowledge of how people from small villages in other countries conduct themselves.It's a very different way of life there and Emma just wants answers.  (I did imagine myself there blowing in like a tornado with my strong willed personality pissing off all the locals making demands left and right.  Lol  Hmmmmmm)Everyone seems to have their secrets but even so Emma does gain a couple of new friends that help her during her investigation and are very kind to her.Then...BAM!!!Note:  I gave the movie 5 stars even though I didn't know any of the actors and usually it takes quite a bit to impress me. I decided to go ahead with the full 5 star rating because of the excellent directing and lead in to the ending.  Best actor in this film?  Paul Hardiman by a landslide.WARNING:  DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM.Now, regarding my thoughts on the death of Kerry.  This is modern times.  WTH???  Why wasn't the area sectioned off and a CSI team called in to scrape under her nails and do a rape kit?Then...you swab the inside of the cheeks of every single man she came in contact with during her stay there.After several STRONG and determined interrogations of all who came in contact with her and then a matchy match to the DNA, then wah la!!!  you've got your man and solved the crime.The one thing wrong with this movie is that it makes you feel like this was set back 100 years ago where the man with da badge say's ""Oh well, these things happen"" and mosey's on back to his comfy office.It's as if no crime scene investigation was done.  Emma didn't ask about that.  She wanted to see the death cert and that's all she asked for.  This was filmed in present day.  Don't tell me Ireland couldn't or wouldn't solve this crime.This gal had all kinds of DNA on her.  It's really odd that the film made you feel like nothing scientific was done.In the states, this would have been an easy case.",5,Wow.,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,2343,"['First', 'all', 'get', 'see', 'beautiful', 'footage', 'Ireland', 'Yay', 'Yep', 'Sheep', 'grazing', 'mountain', 'everything', 'Emma', 'last', 'minute', 'not', 'join', 'best', 'friend', 'Kerry', 'trip', 'Ireland', 'there', 'Kerry', 'up', 'beach', 'dead.Emma', 'travels', 'country', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'police', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'enough.This', 'movie', 'rolls', 'right', 'gaining', 'knowledge', 'how', 'people', 'small', 'villages', 'other', 'countries', 'conduct', 'themselves.It', 'very', 'different', 'way', 'life', 'Emma', 'just', 'answers', 'did', 'imagine', 'there', 'blowing', 'tornado', 'strong', 'willed', 'personality', 'pissing', 'off', 'locals', 'making', 'demands', 'left', 'right', 'Lol', 'Hmmmmmm', 'Everyone', 'have', 'secrets', 'even', 'so', 'Emma', 'gain', 'couple', 'new', 'friends', 'help', 'investigation', 'are', 'very', 'kind', 'her.Then', 'BAM', 'Note', 'gave', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'actors', 'usually', 'quite', 'bit', 'impress', 'decided', 'go', 'ahead', 'full', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'excellent', 'directing', 'lead', 'ending', 'Best', 'actor', 'film', 'Paul', 'Hardiman', 'landslide.WARNING', 'DO', 'NOT', 'READ', 'PAST', 'THIS', 'POINT', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'NOT', 'SEEN', 'THE', 'FILM.Now', 'regarding', 'thoughts', 'death', 'Kerry', 'modern', 'times', 'WTH', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'area', 'sectioned', 'off', 'CSI', 'team', 'called', 'scrape', 'nails', 'do', 'rape', 'kit', 'Then', 'swab', 'inside', 'cheeks', 'single', 'man', 'came', 'contact', 'stay', 'there.After', 'several', 'STRONG', 'determined', 'interrogations', 'who', 'came', 'contact', 'then', 'matchy', 'match', 'DNA', 'then', 'la', ""'ve"", 'got', 'man', 'solved', 'crime.The', 'one', 'thing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'feel', 'was', 'set', 'back', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'where', 'man', 'da', 'badge', 'say', 'Oh', 'well', 'things', 'happen', 'back', 'comfy', 'office.It', 'crime', 'scene', 'investigation', 'was', 'done', 'Emma', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'wanted', 'see', 'death', 'cert', 'asked', 'was', 'filmed', 'present', 'day', 'Do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Ireland', 'could', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'solve', 'crime.This', 'gal', 'had', 'kinds', 'DNA', 'really', 'odd', 'film', 'made', 'feel', 'nothing', 'scientific', 'was', 'done.In', 'states', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'case']",Truth About Kerry
