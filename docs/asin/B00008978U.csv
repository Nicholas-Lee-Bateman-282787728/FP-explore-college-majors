736196,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B00008978U,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","Many say that this film suffered both financially and critically because it was released not long after the cinamatic death penalty hit ""Dead Man Walking"" and consequently tried to measure up.  Personally, I think there is some truth to that as I watched the two films further apart and enjoyed them both.  Granted, this film isn't ""Dead Man Walking"" but it has it's merits and raises a few issues that the other one didn't (i.e. race and perception.)  So ultimately, timing was this film's downfall.  Sheran Stone was great to watch as the woman on Death Row who is coming around to the idea of being sorry for what she's done when she was involved with killing two people (this is loosely based on the real-life case of Karla Fay Tucker from Texas.)  Rob Morrow plays an attorney whose brother got him a job in the office of the Governor of South Carolina, working on the clemancy requests of, among others, the condemned whose time is now upon them...like Miss Stone.  I do wonder about one thing...Rob Morrow's character is said to be a slacker who never took anything seriously.  Law school's no easy thing...how'd he manage to not take that seriously?  Anyway, Mr. Morrow's job originally seems straight-forward:  investigate Stone's character and ""make a recommendation"" to the governor, who makes the ultimate decision as to sparing the condemned's life  Note that there is a second, African American gentlemen also facing an impending lethal injection and his case, while being handled by another attorney, does come up from time to time.  Anyway, it is interesting to watch as both Morrow's and Stone's characters go through their individual transformations while growing closer to one another in the process.  I am glad that there was no traditional love story thrown in here because that would have ruined things.  Rather, the intamacy shared between these two mirrors that shared by the characters in ""Dead Man Walking"" (I hate to keep making comparisons, but the timing of the films' releases and the subsequent critical reviews stemming from this idea make that impossible.)  Stone and Morrow do have a sense of chemistry and when she's dissappointed that he didn't visit one day, it shows.  If you enjoyed ""Dead Man Walking"", you'll find this a decent runner-up worth watching...just wait a little while.

Malone ""Oisa""","[1, 2]","OK, I bought this movie to try a movie on my iPod - there weren't many to choose from and I was hesitant because I don't usually particularly enjoy Sharon Stone - but, wow.  This is a must see movie in my opinion, well acted, etc.  Too bad it somehow didn't get noticed because of ""Dead Man Walking"" - which was a good movie, but would not get 5 stars from me.  All movies have some plots that are used over and over - I believe the saying is that there are really only 5(?) plots - so this one, as all of them do, has intermingled things we've seen before, but they are extremely well interwoven with each other.  As I said, I am not much of a Sharon Stone fan, but she's ""typed out of cast"" in this one, and is very impressive.  Rob Morrow does a great job too, and as, almost, always, Randy Quaid.  I'll watch it many times over - my true judge of whether a movie is good or not.
