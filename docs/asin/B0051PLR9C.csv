1437206,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B0051PLR9C,Allan M. Lees,"[19, 23]","One problem with film synopses in the USA is that any movie in which there is an exposure of female sexual bodily parts is automatically called ""erotic"" as if eroticism resides only in the quick flash of a breast or a buttock. So let's get that out of the way at the beginning: there is no way, by any stretch of the imagination that anyone living outside the USA, Iran, Indonesia, or Saudi Arabia would find this movie in any way erotic, arousing, or titillating.This is a gritty movie about a young girl who runs away from what we presume was an abusive relationship with a foster-father. Certainly, from the flashback we see of her drug-addicted and drug-raddled mother, it's unlikely to have been a loving and supporting family environment. She goes to Sydney with the intention of supporting herself through prostitution, though it's clear that she doesn't have much of a clue about what actual prostitution involves. Peniless and destitute, she takes what she can get - and it's not much. This seventeen-year-old is insufficiently hardened, so she's continually on the receiving end of the brutality of others, even those whom she helps. She ends up witnessing a murder committed by a crooked cop and that trope defines the main plot of the movie and provides its action sequences. But the over-riding theme is the way this waif stumbles through the dystopia of the Sydney underworld in which small lives become even smaller as a result of stunted personalities, drug addiction, mindless violence and world-views that could fit into something rather less capacious than a thimble. This is the world of the brain-dead, the imaginationless, the hopeless, the living dead. And the film captures this world very capably, with an awful sense of claustrophobia. The heroine has run away from small-town Australia but the gutters of Sydney are even more confining than what she fled from.As a parent, I found this film to be very difficult to watch. It's impossible not to sympathize with the heroine and therefore impossible not to yearn to rescue her. But of course it's a movie so all we can do is watch. In real life, thousands of young girls like this go under every year, drowned in the swamp that is the dregs of human behavior. This is one movie that captures the brutal desperation of such places unflinchingly, and that's what matters in the end, not the contrived suspense of the chase theme or the fact that there are nipples on-screen for a few seconds.",4,Intensely depressing and painful,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,2465,"['One', 'problem', 'film', 'synopses', 'USA', 'movie', 'exposure', 'female', 'sexual', 'bodily', 'parts', 'automatically', 'called', 'erotic', 'eroticism', 'only', 'quick', 'flash', 'breast', 'buttock', 'So', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'beginning', 'way', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'anyone', 'living', 'USA', 'Iran', 'Indonesia', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'would', 'find', 'movie', 'way', 'erotic', 'arousing', 'titillating.This', 'gritty', 'movie', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'away', 'what', 'presume', 'was', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'foster-father', 'Certainly', 'flashback', 'see', 'drug-addicted', 'drug-raddled', 'mother', 'unlikely', 'have', 'been', 'loving', 'supporting', 'family', 'environment', 'Sydney', 'intention', 'supporting', 'prostitution', 'clear', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'clue', 'what', 'actual', 'prostitution', 'Peniless', 'destitute', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'not', 'much', 'seventeen-year-old', 'insufficiently', 'hardened', 'continually', 'receiving', 'end', 'brutality', 'others', 'even', 'whom', 'up', 'witnessing', 'murder', 'committed', 'crooked', 'cop', 'trope', 'main', 'plot', 'movie', 'action', 'sequences', 'over-riding', 'theme', 'way', 'waif', 'dystopia', 'Sydney', 'underworld', 'small', 'become', 'even', 'smaller', 'result', 'stunted', 'personalities', 'drug', 'addiction', 'mindless', 'violence', 'world-views', 'could', 'fit', 'something', 'rather', 'less', 'capacious', 'thimble', 'world', 'brain-dead', 'imaginationless', 'hopeless', 'living', 'dead', 'film', 'world', 'very', 'capably', 'awful', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'heroine', 'run', 'away', 'small-town', 'Australia', 'gutters', 'Sydney', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'confining', 'what', 'fled', 'from.As', 'parent', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'impossible', 'not', 'sympathize', 'heroine', 'therefore', 'impossible', 'not', 'yearn', 'rescue', 'course', 'movie', 'so', 'can', 'do', 'watch', 'real', 'life', 'thousands', 'young', 'girls', 'go', 'year', 'drowned', 'swamp', 'dregs', 'human', 'behavior', 'one', 'movie', 'brutal', 'desperation', 'such', 'places', 'unflinchingly', 'what', 'end', 'not', 'contrived', 'suspense', 'chase', 'theme', 'fact', 'are', 'nipples', 'on-screen', 'few', 'seconds']",X

1437209,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0051PLR9C,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","X is an incredibly slow-moving movie in the beginning but by all means, stick with it and you'll be rewarded for your efforts.  You see the beginning is all about a young prostitute roaming the streets and doing all the dirty deeds that she has to do just to make some money and survive in a harsh, compassionless city infested with creepy sex-craved men.  This of course means having to get inside vehicles with men who have the money to do whatever their perverted hearts desire.  It's a really gross business and I'm glad I never have to associate with anything related to this in reality.Anyway, the girl who plays the prostitute is really cute and as we discover a VERY good actress.  It's about this young girl eventually becoming friends with another prostitute that encounters her to participate in a sex act where she can make 300 bucks.  The girl reluctantly agrees after some pretty persistent convincing on the other prostitutes part.  Well from here, *now* the storyline actually gets going!While the two prostitutes are partying and having sex with the man at the apartment, a mysterious phone call alarms the man to the point that he tells the two girls to quickly hide in the back bathroom of the hotel.  When this mysterious man arrives and enters the room... he commits a murder and of course, he soon realizes that there's witnesses hiding in the back room, so the two girls take off running.  The chase is now on!  They have to take off running and hiding from this man whenever he gets near.This movie actually serves another purpose- it shows to me that if your life ever gets to the point that you have to rely on having sex just to make some money, well, I was actually feeling really sorry for the prostitute and the many problems she was forced to face just by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  But this is by no means a drama- well it is in a few spots I suppose, but it's mainly a suspense.  The way the movie ends however, is pretty fascinating.  The final line of the movie puts the icing on the cake because it's so appropriate.  The story is pretty elaborate how it gets to that point just to deliver that one fantastic line and of course I don't wanna spoil what's said, but it's totally worth it.  The right ending indeed.I recommend X.  Not the greatest story in the world, but you really feel for the girl and want her to survive and overcome the obstacles that stand in her way.",4,be careful who you bump into,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,2426,"['X', 'incredibly', 'slow-moving', 'movie', 'beginning', 'means', 'stick', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'efforts', 'see', 'beginning', 'young', 'prostitute', 'roaming', 'streets', 'doing', 'dirty', 'do', 'just', 'make', 'money', 'survive', 'harsh', 'compassionless', 'city', 'infested', 'creepy', 'sex-craved', 'men', 'course', 'means', 'having', 'get', 'inside', 'vehicles', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'money', 'do', 'whatever', 'perverted', 'hearts', 'desire', 'really', 'gross', 'business', ""'m"", 'glad', 'never', 'have', 'associate', 'anything', 'related', 'reality.Anyway', 'girl', 'who', 'prostitute', 'really', 'cute', 'discover', 'VERY', 'good', 'actress', 'young', 'girl', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'friends', 'prostitute', 'participate', 'sex', 'act', 'where', 'can', 'make', '300', 'bucks', 'girl', 'reluctantly', 'pretty', 'persistent', 'convincing', 'other', 'prostitutes', 'part', 'Well', 'here', 'storyline', 'actually', 'going', 'two', 'prostitutes', 'are', 'partying', 'having', 'sex', 'man', 'apartment', 'mysterious', 'phone', 'call', 'man', 'point', 'two', 'girls', 'quickly', 'hide', 'back', 'bathroom', 'hotel', 'When', 'mysterious', 'man', 'room', 'murder', 'course', 'soon', 'witnesses', 'hiding', 'back', 'room', 'two', 'girls', 'take', 'off', 'running', 'chase', 'now', 'have', 'take', 'off', 'running', 'hiding', 'man', 'whenever', 'near.This', 'movie', 'actually', 'purpose-', 'life', 'ever', 'point', 'have', 'rely', 'having', 'sex', 'just', 'make', 'money', 'well', 'was', 'actually', 'feeling', 'really', 'sorry', 'prostitute', 'many', 'problems', 'was', 'forced', 'face', 'just', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'means', 'drama-', 'well', 'few', 'spots', 'suppose', 'mainly', 'suspense', 'way', 'movie', 'however', 'pretty', 'fascinating', 'final', 'line', 'movie', 'icing', 'cake', 'so', 'appropriate', 'story', 'pretty', 'elaborate', 'how', 'point', 'just', 'deliver', 'one', 'fantastic', 'line', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'spoil', 'what', 'said', 'totally', 'worth', 'right', 'ending', 'indeed.I', 'recommend', 'X', 'Not', 'greatest', 'story', 'world', 'really', 'feel', 'girl', 'want', 'survive', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'stand', 'way']",X

From there we are shown the wildly divergent paths of two prostitutes named Holly (Viva Bianca) and Shay (Hannah Mangan-Lawrence). Holly is a high-priced call-girl, while Shay is a common street walker. One of Holly's johns, a married &#34;family man&#34; named Michael, wants her to run away w/ him. Unfortunately for Holly, Michael happens to be a violent, sadistic slug. She just wants to get out of town, and never look back. Holly's journey begins after her roommate slips and falls in the shower, and Holly can't get into her apartment. She hops in a cab and along the way, almost runs over Shay, who has been beaten up and robbed. It just so happens that Holly needs a second girl for a scheduled threesome. It pays well, so Shay takes her up on it. This client is not just another pervert. He's a criminal in trouble w/ his boss, who shows up unexpectedly. While the girls are hiding in the bathroom, the john is executed in the hotel room! Now, Holly and Shay must run for their lives from this murdering madman! They split up, and the killer tracks Holly down. She proves to be far more formidable than he had expected! Holly's no pushover! However, she IS in very serious trouble. The man kidnaps Holly and forces her to help him to find Shay. Will either one of these women survive the night?

1437226,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0051PLR9C,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 8]","I decided to check out Jon Hewitt's ""X"" anticipating a provocative adult drama. And indeed as the film opened with a delightfully unexpected and somewhat creepy sexual escapade, I thought this Australian endeavor might be a pleasantly twisted surprise exploring the seamy underbelly of the prostitution trade. The film is structured around two working girls, one is a high end call girl on the eve of retirement (Viva Bianca) and one is a penniless girl (Hanna Mangan Lawrence) spending her first night on the streets. As the opening sequences juxtaposed their exploits, the movie is an interesting examination of contrasting lifestyles. Both actresses are quite good in their respective roles, but it is Bianca who really stole the show for me. Recently seen in the Starz original ""Spartacus"" series as the wily and cunning Ilithyia, it was interesting to see her in something more modern (but no less explicit). And if these two roles are any indication, I suspect she is just at the beginning of her career.I was wholeheartedly invested in the plights of these two women and as they came together (a bit conveniently), I was willing to go with the flow and see where the picture was headed. But then--boom! Any hope of originality drains out of the film. Instead of continuing to develop these rich characters, the plotting turns into a situation that we've seen a million times. On a gig, the ladies see a violent crime and must go on the run for their lives! From here on out, it's a by-the-numbers chase flick. There are car chases, beat downs, and the requisite final showdown that distinguishes every picture in this genre. It's all still well acted, with moments of considerable interest, but it often starts to fall short of the logic test. There is nothing surprising or original about the conclusion of the movie, and it's a shame--it had started out with such promise.After seeing the movie, I noticed that for distribution purposes the film had also been called ""X: Night of Vengeance"" which cues one to the B-movie aspect that pervades the plot. I think Hewitt is talented, the film is well executed if unimaginative. I particularly thought the use of Kings Cross in Sydney as the primary setting gave them film a pleasantly dirty and gritty feeling. Furthermore, I think Bianca is a star. She is fearless here and really lays into the role. In the end, though, I just wished the film's second half didn't travel such a predictable road. Worth a look still, especially for Bianca, I'd rate this at about 3 1/2 stars and I look forward to Hewitt's next offering.

They were also equally as boring with little action but, I take that back there's a bit more suspense in this movie that makes it somewhat engaging more or less.

There is a fair amount of nudity and violence along the way too.Director Jon Hewitt has done a reasonable job of getting fairly good performances from the cast, there are some that could have been improved, but this is a fast paced thriller that tries very hard not to pull its punches. That is where it has real strength and not in the character development and I must say I thought it was very good indeed.There are a couple of plot holes in this 89 minute action fest, but they are so minor that they can be overlooked for the sake of entertainment, and entertaining this really is. Another great film from Australia that deals with crime, not as good as `Animal Kingdom' but a very close run thing.",4,Fast Paced Thriller in the Bowels of Sydney's Sleazy Underworld.,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,1749,"['scene', 'Sydney', 'high', 'class', 'call', 'girl', 'way', 'do', 'action', 'life', 'class', 'Jude', 'Law', 'look', 'likie', 'front', 'Sydney', 'well', 'do', 'ladies', 'sit', 'circle', 'sipping', 'champagne', 'heroic', 'duo', 'get', 'sort', 'upper', 'class', 'dogging', 'class', 'who', 'said', 'Australians', 'have', 'culture', 'courtesan', 'Holly', 'Rowe', 'Viva', 'Bianca', 'decided', 'quit', 'profession', 'retire', 'Paris', 'Problem', ""n't"", 'told', 'eerily', 'controlling', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'leave', 'family', 'be', 'oops', 'also', 'work', 'right', 'time', 'get', 'flight', 'also', 'have', 'story', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'runaway', 'Shay', 'Ryan', 'Hannah', 'Mangan-Lawrence', 'penniless', 'going', 'start', 'bottom', 'street', 'walking', 'trade', 'giving', 'hand', 'relief', 'few', 'dollars.Fate', 'two', 'women', 'together', 'end', 'up', 'situation', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'What', 'next', 'full', 'ride', 'very', 'sleazy', 'belly', 'Sydney', 'including', 'drug', 'abuse', 'flesh', 'pots', 'corrupt', 'coppers', 'fair', 'amount', 'nudity', 'violence', 'way', 'too.Director', 'Jon', 'Hewitt', 'done', 'reasonable', 'job', 'getting', 'fairly', 'good', 'performances', 'cast', 'are', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'fast', 'paced', 'thriller', 'very', 'hard', 'not', 'pull', 'punches', 'where', 'real', 'strength', 'not', 'character', 'development', 'must', 'say', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'indeed.There', 'are', 'couple', 'plot', 'holes', '89', 'minute', 'action', 'fest', 'are', 'so', 'minor', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'sake', 'entertainment', 'entertaining', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'Australia', 'deals', 'crime', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'very', 'close', 'run', 'thing']",X
