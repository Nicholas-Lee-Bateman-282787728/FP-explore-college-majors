1524245,AS86P91K3O445,B0071POHGA,Nocternal1985,"[5, 7]","Very violent horror revenge thriller about a group of photographers who capture, rape and kill actresses and models. Kind of like I Spit on Your Grave or Last House on  the Left but with a more modern look and feel.The acting is quite good for a indie horror of this nature and it can be very emotional too. They were very good and it helped the seriousness and they performed the characters and events believably. However, it has a lot of violent sexual content which is not for everyone. Not over the top gory, but has a couple of very nasty kills and is very real and effective in tone. Not like most over the top indie horrors.I liked it a lot and found it very powerful and gritty. But it is not by any means 'fun' and you have to like this kind of film to consider watching it.",4,Strong revenge flic.

For instance, the first scene with the naked girl, who was totally delectable in the bath tub, and the second I coudn't remember. This movie looked promising after the first scene with the hot model, then after that it turned something awful I couldn't describe. I know they cut five minutes out of the movie, because it was too gory and sexually explicit...give me a break.  This piece of art is meant to be trashy, sleazy, and tasteless, it is not for everyone. However, more imagination would help, and a good screenwriter. Other than that, once again he does a decent job finding hot, depraved chicks who love getting naked in front of the lense.",1,I Liked His First Movie Better,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,777,"['was', 'couple', 'good', 'parts', 'liked', '34', 'Burlesque', 'Massacre.', '34', 'same', 'writer', 'director', 'movie', 'instance', 'first', 'scene', 'naked', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'totally', 'delectable', 'bath', 'tub', 'second', 'coud', ""n't"", 'remember', 'movie', 'looked', 'promising', 'first', 'scene', 'hot', 'model', 'then', 'turned', 'something', 'awful', 'could', ""n't"", 'describe', 'know', 'cut', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'gory', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'give', 'break', 'piece', 'art', 'meant', 'be', 'trashy', 'sleazy', 'tasteless', 'not', 'everyone', 'However', 'more', 'imagination', 'would', 'help', 'good', 'screenwriter', 'Other', 'once', 'again', 'decent', 'job', 'finding', 'hot', 'depraved', 'chicks', 'who', 'love', 'getting', 'naked', 'front', 'lense']",PhotoGRAPHIC

1524249,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B0071POHGA,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[3, 6]","I (almost) find it humorous that I am referencing a Duran Duran song to describe this film. Why one might ask?  Well ""Girls on Film"" is an upbeat song, a great song in my humble opinion, but this movie is anything but upbeat. The movie basically is about a young woman named Amanda living in LA and is looking for her big break in the entertainment industry.  She spends her days auditioning for movies and/or modeling for photographers.  Amanda seems like she will ""do"" just about anything for her breakthrough. Meanwhile there are two guys who are setting up photo shoots with female models.  Then they get their kicks by accosting, raping and killing these women while they photograph it. It isn't long before Amanda crosses paths with the psychotic photographers. There actually is a bit more to the plot but this is the meat and potatoes.As for the movie it is disturbing, graphic and raw, which isn't too surprising given the plot description. This movie in many ways (at least for me) had an ""I Spit on Your Grave"" vibe.  Notwithstanding, I see a difference between ISOYG and this film.  Where the former is about a rape and the revenge, the latter is an allegory or fable for what one will do for the price of fame. And that price could have some dire outcomes. Perhaps I am reading too much into it, but that is the way I viewed the movie.As for the production of the movie, I felt it was very, very good.  It is a low budget film and while many folks hear the term ""low budget"" they feel that equates to schlock or crap.  In some cases that is true but not with ""PhotoGraphic"". However, if a person isn't familiar with lower budget film making and/or is expecting a mainstream film they might be disappointed.  The fact that this is a lower budget film allows the creators to really push the envelope. I also found the acting to be good too, I have seen much, much worse.  Given that some of the scenes were so extreme the performers worked well with what they were given.  As for the actress that played Amanda, I found her mesmerizing and believable. She also reminded me of someone, I still can't figure out if it is another actress or somebody that I have known personally. And not for nothing all the other actresses in this film are very pretty.This movie was directed by Timothy Whitfield who also made ""Burlesque Massacre"". Under the assumption one hasn't seen ""Burlesque Massacre"", I would strongly recommend it if exploitation horror is your cup of tea.  Nevertheless, Whitfield and Timberwolf Entertainment bring the same integrity to ""PhotoGraphic"" that they did to ""Burlesque Massacre"".In conclusion I really enjoyed this movie in spite that certain parts of this movie aren't easy to watch, regardless of some ""over the top"" moments.  There will be some people will hate this movie for what it portrays and I for one can totally respect that.  I for one found it different, engaging and like noted prior a ""what is it really worth"" type of fable.  So if a person wants a very dark, malefic, captivating and unconventional film watch this movie.",4,"""Girls on Film"".......Dead Girls",1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,3068,"['almost', 'find', 'humorous', 'am', 'referencing', 'Duran', 'Duran', 'song', 'describe', 'film', 'Why', 'one', 'might', 'ask', 'Well', 'Girls', 'Film', 'upbeat', 'song', 'great', 'song', 'humble', 'opinion', 'movie', 'anything', 'upbeat', 'movie', 'basically', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Amanda', 'living', 'LA', 'looking', 'big', 'break', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'days', 'auditioning', 'movies', 'and/or', 'modeling', 'photographers', 'Amanda', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'breakthrough', 'Meanwhile', 'are', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'setting', 'up', 'photo', 'shoots', 'female', 'models', 'Then', 'get', 'kicks', 'accosting', 'raping', 'killing', 'women', 'photograph', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Amanda', 'paths', 'psychotic', 'photographers', 'actually', 'bit', 'more', 'plot', 'meat', 'potatoes.As', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'graphic', 'raw', ""n't"", 'too', 'surprising', 'given', 'plot', 'description', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'least', 'had', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'vibe', 'Notwithstanding', 'see', 'difference', 'ISOYG', 'film', 'Where', 'former', 'rape', 'revenge', 'latter', 'allegory', 'fable', 'what', 'one', 'will', 'do', 'price', 'fame', 'price', 'could', 'have', 'dire', 'outcomes', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'viewed', 'movie.As', 'production', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'many', 'folks', 'hear', 'term', 'low', 'budget', 'feel', 'schlock', 'crap', 'cases', 'true', 'not', 'PhotoGraphic', 'However', 'person', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'lower', 'budget', 'film', 'making', 'and/or', 'expecting', 'mainstream', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'lower', 'budget', 'film', 'creators', 'really', 'push', 'envelope', 'also', 'found', 'acting', 'be', 'good', 'too', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'Given', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'extreme', 'performers', 'worked', 'well', 'what', 'were', 'given', 'actress', 'played', 'Amanda', 'found', 'mesmerizing', 'believable', 'also', 'reminded', 'someone', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'actress', 'somebody', 'have', 'known', 'personally', 'not', 'nothing', 'other', 'actresses', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'pretty.This', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Timothy', 'Whitfield', 'who', 'also', 'made', 'Burlesque', 'Massacre', 'assumption', 'one', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Burlesque', 'Massacre', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'exploitation', 'horror', 'cup', 'tea', 'Nevertheless', 'Whitfield', 'Timberwolf', 'Entertainment', 'bring', 'same', 'integrity', 'PhotoGraphic', 'did', 'Burlesque', 'Massacre', '.In', 'conclusion', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'spite', 'certain', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'easy', 'watch', 'regardless', 'top', 'moments', 'will', 'be', 'people', 'will', 'hate', 'movie', 'what', 'one', 'can', 'totally', 'respect', 'one', 'found', 'different', 'engaging', 'noted', 'prior', 'what', 'really', 'worth', 'type', 'fable', 'So', 'person', 'very', 'dark', 'malefic', 'captivating', 'unconventional', 'film', 'watch', 'movie']",PhotoGRAPHIC
