1445031,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0057SJUKQ,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[1, 1]","Fulfilling fantasies ... for a price ... is the profession of Dale, a 28 year old London escort, whose own passions run toward anonymous sex in dangerous situations.  His best friend is Sean, a timid young man who makes his living doing drag, does drugs to face the day, and trades verbal barbs with his alcoholic mother.  Dale also has a secret crush on his ""straight"" friend Raj, who just announced he is getting married (to a woman), which presents Dale with mixed emotions.  The brutal murder of another escort gives everyone a reason to be concerned about Dale, and his friends and family tiptoe around trying to convince him to change his ways.This is essentially a story about modern-day relationships, with their unique baggage and difficulty to express how you really feel.  The film looks into the relationships and hopes of all three main characters, with occasionally wit but - unfortunately - often unrealistic  melodrama. The characters are the draw here, rather than their stories, and that makes the film seem uneven at times.  I also thought Christopher Kelham was a bit flat in his portrayal of Dale.  Overall, I give it three stars out of five.  DVD has deleted scenes and photo gallery.  Not rated, but would be a heavy R for simulated sexual contact.",3,Looking at the problems of modern day relationships.,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,1271,"['Fulfilling', 'fantasies', 'price', 'profession', 'Dale', '28', 'year', 'old', 'London', 'escort', 'own', 'passions', 'run', 'anonymous', 'sex', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'best', 'friend', 'Sean', 'timid', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'living', 'doing', 'drag', 'drugs', 'face', 'day', 'trades', 'verbal', 'barbs', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'Dale', 'also', 'secret', 'crush', 'straight', 'friend', 'Raj', 'who', 'just', 'announced', 'getting', 'married', 'woman', 'Dale', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'brutal', 'murder', 'escort', 'everyone', 'reason', 'be', 'concerned', 'Dale', 'friends', 'family', 'tiptoe', 'around', 'trying', 'convince', 'change', 'ways.This', 'essentially', 'story', 'modern-day', 'relationships', 'unique', 'baggage', 'difficulty', 'express', 'how', 'really', 'feel', 'film', 'relationships', 'hopes', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'occasionally', 'wit', 'unfortunately', 'often', 'unrealistic', 'melodrama', 'characters', 'are', 'draw', 'here', 'rather', 'stories', 'film', 'seem', 'uneven', 'times', 'also', 'thought', 'Christopher', 'Kelham', 'was', 'bit', 'flat', 'portrayal', 'Dale', 'Overall', 'give', 'three', 'five', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'photo', 'gallery', 'Not', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'heavy', 'R', 'simulated', 'sexual', 'contact']",The Cost of Love

1445034,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B0057SJUKQ,J. Martin,"[8, 10]","Sometimes when a very bad movie gets a great review, it's because a friend or relative of someone involved in making the movie wrote it. Sometimes that's obvious just from reading the review, but not always. Having now seen this movie myself, I cannot trust any positive review it gets.This movie is just terrible. Everything about it is bad: the strident, preposterous screenplay; the harsh, always-on, NEVER-believable acting (if it's fair to real actors to call it that - Michael Joyce and Mandeesh Gill in particular are embarrassingly bad, although Joyce has a bigger role so he sticks out more); the noisy, too-loud and never appropriate music; the interminable fake sex scenes that are always shot from the same weird angle, with the same frenzied, mechanical, totally fake grunts, groans, grimaces and spastic moves - scenes that last ten times as long as they should even if they were good; and the idiotic photography.The normal way to film a conversation is to film each actor separately and then edit the shots together into a conversation. THIS director or cinematographer sometimes chose instead to swing the camera back and forth between actors: one reads his line, then the camera swings quickly 90 to the other actor, who says his line, then back to the first actor, etc. In at least one scene he does it between THREE actors. It's dizzying, and not in a good way. I've never seen anything like it. Whether it was done to save production time and costs or with some crazed idea that it's a cool way to make a movie, it's a big, BIG mistake.Every character in this movie would be unbearably obnoxious if they were at all believable; as it was, I just kept hoping against hope that the counter was wrong and there weren't REALLY 53 minutes left, then 52 minutes, and so on. I forced myself to stay with it all the way to the end, but I wouldn't wish such torture even on Dick Cheney. This is the worst movie I've seen in years.",1,Makes me suspicious of the good reviews,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,1942,"['Sometimes', 'when', 'very', 'bad', 'movie', 'great', 'review', 'friend', 'relative', 'someone', 'involved', 'making', 'movie', 'wrote', 'obvious', 'just', 'reading', 'review', 'not', 'always', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'positive', 'review', 'gets.This', 'movie', 'just', 'terrible', 'Everything', 'bad', 'strident', 'preposterous', 'screenplay', 'harsh', 'always-on', 'NEVER-believable', 'acting', 'fair', 'real', 'actors', 'call', 'Michael', 'Joyce', 'Mandeesh', 'Gill', 'particular', 'are', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'Joyce', 'bigger', 'role', 'out', 'more', 'noisy', 'too-loud', 'never', 'appropriate', 'music', 'interminable', 'fake', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'always', 'shot', 'same', 'weird', 'angle', 'same', 'frenzied', 'mechanical', 'totally', 'fake', 'grunts', 'groans', 'grimaces', 'spastic', 'moves', 'scenes', 'last', 'ten', 'times', 'as', 'long', 'should', 'even', 'were', 'good', 'idiotic', 'photography.The', 'normal', 'way', 'film', 'conversation', 'film', 'actor', 'separately', 'then', 'edit', 'shots', 'together', 'conversation', 'THIS', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'sometimes', 'chose', 'instead', 'swing', 'camera', 'back', 'forth', 'actors', 'one', 'line', 'then', 'camera', 'swings', 'quickly', '90', 'other', 'actor', 'who', 'line', 'then', 'back', 'first', 'actor', 'etc', 'least', 'one', 'scene', 'THREE', 'actors', 'dizzying', 'not', 'good', 'way', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'was', 'done', 'save', 'production', 'time', 'costs', 'crazed', 'idea', 'cool', 'way', 'make', 'movie', 'big', 'BIG', 'mistake.Every', 'character', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'unbearably', 'obnoxious', 'were', 'believable', 'was', 'just', 'kept', 'hoping', 'hope', 'counter', 'was', 'wrong', 'were', ""n't"", 'REALLY', '53', 'minutes', 'left', 'then', '52', 'minutes', 'so', 'forced', 'stay', 'way', 'end', 'would', ""n't"", 'wish', 'such', 'torture', 'even', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years']",The Cost of Love

1445038,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0057SJUKQ,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","This is an indie gay themed film from writer and director Carl Medland. It tells the story of Dale, a 28 year old `hustler' and his friends. Dale (Christopher Kelham) has some strange clients who have a number of strange proclivities, which does go some way to breathing humour into the plot. He likes to indulge their fantasies, whether it be nappy wearing or aggressive domestic cleaning. He then does a fair bit of cruising in the evenings. I would be worn out personally speaking.He has a closeted Asian friend Raj (Valmier Rampersad - who is really good), who announces he is getting married - predictably to a woman. Dale is rather in love with him and takes it none too well. He uses his other friend the drag queen with the alcoholic mum, Sean (played by the late Michael Joyce) as a sounding board of his emotions and does not always like what he hears. As Sean says `if you want to be heard - speak the truth'. Dale also uses his mate Ricardo for extra frison with some of his punters and they seem to have some genuine on screen chemistry, both in and out of bed. There isn't that much in the way of `action' here either, but if you want that, then you should really go for the top shelf stuff and not this more `eye level' fare.There are more than a few stereotypes here, but I am fine with that, we also have a drag race, which is always fun and masses of eye make up too. There are some production issues, like poor dubbing at the beginning and editing that could have been harsher. But this is an indie effort and it is well shot and the acting is above average, but not award winning by any standard. There are also some plot twists that are a bit hard to swallow - no pun intended, but that is artistic choice.I liked the music too which is provided by `Cherrystone'. Medland has made a good if not excellent film, and we do need more gay themed films, but this says as much about what is lacking as it does about being a talent showcase. Despite its shortcomings I still found it to be a rather enjoyable watch, I am awarding three stars but it's closer to three and a half; more than worth it for a rental.",3,"Drag Queens, Cruising, Saunas and no queues for a toilet in a Gay Bar",1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,2125,"['indie', 'gay', 'themed', 'film', 'writer', 'director', 'Carl', 'Medland', 'story', 'Dale', '28', 'year', 'old', 'hustler', 'friends', 'Dale', 'Christopher', 'Kelham', 'strange', 'clients', 'who', 'have', 'number', 'strange', 'proclivities', 'go', 'way', 'breathing', 'humour', 'plot', 'indulge', 'fantasies', 'be', 'nappy', 'wearing', 'aggressive', 'domestic', 'cleaning', 'then', 'fair', 'bit', 'cruising', 'evenings', 'would', 'be', 'worn', 'out', 'personally', 'speaking.He', 'closeted', 'Asian', 'friend', 'Raj', 'Valmier', 'Rampersad', 'who', 'really', 'good', 'who', 'getting', 'married', 'predictably', 'woman', 'Dale', 'rather', 'love', 'none', 'too', 'well', 'other', 'friend', 'drag', 'queen', 'alcoholic', 'mum', 'Sean', 'played', 'late', 'Michael', 'Joyce', 'sounding', 'board', 'emotions', 'not', 'always', 'what', 'Sean', 'want', 'be', 'heard', 'speak', 'truth', 'Dale', 'also', 'mate', 'Ricardo', 'extra', 'frison', 'punters', 'seem', 'have', 'genuine', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'bed', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'way', 'action', 'here', 'either', 'want', 'then', 'should', 'really', 'go', 'top', 'shelf', 'stuff', 'not', 'more', 'eye', 'level', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'stereotypes', 'here', 'am', 'fine', 'also', 'have', 'drag', 'race', 'always', 'fun', 'masses', 'eye', 'make', 'up', 'too', 'are', 'production', 'issues', 'poor', 'dubbing', 'beginning', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'harsher', 'indie', 'effort', 'well', 'shot', 'acting', 'above', 'average', 'not', 'winning', 'standard', 'are', 'also', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'bit', 'hard', 'swallow', 'pun', 'intended', 'artistic', 'choice.I', 'liked', 'music', 'too', 'provided', 'Cherrystone', 'Medland', 'made', 'good', 'not', 'excellent', 'film', 'do', 'need', 'more', 'gay', 'themed', 'films', 'as', 'much', 'what', 'lacking', 'being', 'talent', 'showcase', 'shortcomings', 'still', 'found', 'be', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'am', 'awarding', 'three', 'stars', 'closer', 'three', 'half', 'more', 'worth', 'rental']",The Cost of Love
