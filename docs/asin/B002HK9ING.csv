1268644,A1LBVG3VS9CI4,B002HK9ING,Danton M.,"[2, 3]","The workouts themselves are very challenging, but the instructor and girls provide a range of alternate poses. For that, it's an excellent DVD. However, the instructor's CONSTANT chatter is extremely distracting, his references to &#34;this body&#34; being particularly annoying to me. Not even during the final resting pose does he get quiet to let you just relax. He mentions meditating for a moment, but doesn't allow any quiet time to do so. Were it not for this, I'd give this DVD five stars, but the more I do the program, the more intrusive the instructor's voice has become.",3,"If the instructor would just be quiet, this would be excellent",1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,582,"['workouts', 'are', 'very', 'challenging', 'instructor', 'girls', 'provide', 'range', 'alternate', 'poses', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'However', 'instructor', 'CONSTANT', 'chatter', 'extremely', 'distracting', 'references', '34', 'body', '34', 'being', 'particularly', 'annoying', 'Not', 'even', 'final', 'resting', 'pose', 'get', 'quiet', 'let', 'just', 'relax', 'meditating', 'moment', ""n't"", 'allow', 'quiet', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'Were', 'not', ""'d"", 'give', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'more', 'do', 'program', 'more', 'intrusive', 'instructor', 'voice', 'become']",N/A
1268645,A2GH2XDBVIMKYV,B002HK9ING,J. Thornberg,"[4, 4]","I wasn't sure about this one so tried on Netflix first, but was pleasantly surprised.  There are 2 practices on the disc, 1 25-minute and 1 45-minute.  Both are good basic flow yoga workouts that really focus on breathing and improving strength/flexibility.  I like that the instructor is not performing the yoga, I believe that it feels more like a class that way than a practice, and I like the way he starts with the easiest pose and then explains other variations in order of difficulty.  He is also very easy to follow verbally, after the first couple times doing the workout I started looking at the screen very little.  The 45 minute practice flies by, and normally I get pretty bored during yoga, so I definitely recommend!  Only down side is sometimes the camera can be a little wobbly, which can be disorienting when you watch it, and some people would probably think he talks too constantly, but I like the continual verbal cues and encouragement.",4,Good flow workout,1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,958,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'one', 'so', 'tried', 'Netflix', 'first', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'are', '2', 'practices', 'disc', '1', '25-minute', '1', '45-minute', 'are', 'good', 'basic', 'flow', 'yoga', 'really', 'focus', 'breathing', 'improving', 'strength/flexibility', 'like', 'instructor', 'not', 'performing', 'yoga', 'believe', 'more', 'class', 'way', 'practice', 'like', 'way', 'easiest', 'pose', 'then', 'other', 'variations', 'order', 'difficulty', 'also', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'verbally', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'doing', 'workout', 'started', 'looking', 'screen', 'very', 'little', '45', 'minute', 'practice', 'flies', 'normally', 'get', 'pretty', 'bored', 'yoga', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Only', 'down', 'side', 'sometimes', 'camera', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'wobbly', 'can', 'be', 'disorienting', 'when', 'watch', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'think', 'talks', 'too', 'constantly', 'like', 'continual', 'verbal', 'cues', 'encouragement']",N/A

1268648,A3JGIMBV5KO34M,B002HK9ING,"Thoughtful ""Thoughtful""","[3, 3]","This is a great yoga DVD.  I think the 25 minute practice is easier than the 45 minute one so I do the 45 minute one more often.  The workout really is about 40 minutes with the last minutes for meditation.  The instructor is male and walks around throughout the DVD instructing the &#34;cheerleader&#34; participants.  He starts with a brush fire warm-up.  Then he goest to a yoga squat.  Then he starts the standing flow poses.  After the standing poses are the floor work which seems mroe brief.  Poses included include warrior 1, warrior 2, reverse warrior, triangle, pigeon, airplane, cobblers, downward facing dog, upward facing dog, cat/cow, bow, boat, bridge, wheel, plank, reversed inclined plane, dolphin, warrior 1/chair with twist.  There is no chanting but he does interject positive thoughts ,for example, how,&#34;you can take this ability to move throw the challenges of your life with you.&#34;  Poses not included include: warrior 3,pose of the dancer, balancing stick, revolved triangle, and crow.
