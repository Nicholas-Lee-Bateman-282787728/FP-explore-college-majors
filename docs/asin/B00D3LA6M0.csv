Luke Evans is perfect in his role, he's definitely jumped on my list of favourite actors with this movie. It has some gory parts, but its not as gory as you might think when looking at the cover or trailer. The acting was pretty much top notch from everyone actually. It was a hard time rooting for anyone because they're all quite evil, but then you have a moment of softness every now and then for some and wished they would see it through the movie. The ending was well done in my opinion, not the showdown but the very last part, kinda gave a strange vibe.

For a movie entitled No One Lives..well...SPOILER ALERT................SPOILER ALERT.............a couple of people live!  Very disappointing, especially when the guy who is so brutal sets her free.  And that's about all there is to the movie.  There is no backstory as to why our Psycho kept the blonde (think her name was Emma) in the trunk and a girlfriend (I think the girlfriend's name was Betty).  Also, Betty seems bothered that the Psycho spends time with Emma, yet she stays with him?  There just wasn't enough of a story to keep me that entertained or to care about any of the characters involved.The gore was there but not in a EWWWWW gross clinch edge of your seat moment.  The gore was just gore.  The Psycho puts one guy in a grinder then puts his remains in a burlap sack for his friends to find.  When his friends discover the sack they kick it, the bag ruptures and ""splat"" goopy mess falls on floor.  What I don't understand is why the blood wasn't leaking our of or at least staining the sack.

A tried and tested formula, but this film is outstanding and comes up with some inspired set pieces. Interesting characters and storylines, and the four main females are great fun and act brilliantly. The locations are Hospitals, Motels, and assorted properties in quite remote wooded areas of Louisiana and this Bluray print copes really well with the occasional dark patches. The colors and blood colours are excellent. Very bloody and the violence is usually of the onscreen direct variety. The shower scene, although intercut with dialogue, is one of the better ones and quite Hitchcockian in its presentation and clarity.

But the script is really sneaky and charming aided and abetted by Luke Evans' performance e.g. ""re-low-cate.""This movie is rife with dishy indictments on the character of the perpetrator BUT it also is an amusing hint at the US relationship with its two enslaved World War opponents.The perpetrator can be interpreted as some NEET shut-in fantasizing about what an awesome ninja he is and is capable of pulling off all these unbelievable scenarios (coincidentally, the Japanese director hired to shoot this script has claimed interest in making a ninja movie in the future) while undeserved compliments are thrown his way by attractive young women including the waitress' ""Very funny.""  Like Wolverine in Japan, this film relies heavily on the innate talent and ability to pull in the audience of its leading man.The dialogue between the main character (or some murderous unattractive dork fantasizing in his bedroom about his ideal dating situation) and his two female victims is INCREDIBLE.

Presented by WWE Films and from the director of The Midnight Meat Train, NO ONE LIVES has a cast of talented character actors: the very lovely Laura Ramsey, the always memorable Lee Tergesen, Gary Grubbs and genre-staple America Olivo. However, none of the actors are given the chance to shine due to a sore lack of character development. This movie felt more like a sequel than an introductory tale. The back story of Evans' ""Driver"" and the women in his life would have made for a far more interesting story, especially given the chemistry that existed between Luke Evans, Laura Ramsey and Adelaide Clemens, whose work I was previously unfamiliar with.The gore is excessive and the cinematography unremarkable, serving only to dilute the stronger points of first-timer David Cohen's script and borrowing more than once from Ted Demme's Silence of the Lambs visuals. The script is chocked full of familiar catchphrases, which standout even more given the sparse amount of dialogue. The humor is occasional but works, thanks to the effortlessness Luke Evans conveys in the lead role and a well-choreographed, if not misplaced, ""chick fight"".

A couple is driving down the road looking to 'relocate'. They stop for a night at a motel and get some dinner. While having dinner they are harassed by a member of this group of criminals before the leader stops him. Later on the couple is run off the road by the man who harassed them and kidnapped. Though at first the leader disagrees when finding out what has happened, he changes his mind soon enough. One of the bigger members of the group is threatening to torture the couple in a secluded location. Suddenly the lady takes her own life before anything can happen to the surprise of the torturer and dismay of her handcuffed lover. The man escapes his handcuffs and kills the torturer, showing a violent well trained side to him and sets out to get revenge on the rest of the group. But the couple have been hiding a terrible secret this entire time that will disturb even the ruthless criminals who kidnapped them. Thats just part of the plot. There are some more small subplots, but you'll just have to see the movie yourself to find out!This movie caught me by surprise. Of course anyone who has seen the trailer knows that the twist of the movie is given away. Even the DVD/Blu Ray cover itself gives away the twist. This movie could have had a wider theatrical release and could have been more successful if the marketing was handled better. I feel like, if under the right marketing hands, the movie could have been just as financially successful as the WWE studios last horror movie ""The Call"". I initially thought this was going to be another mindless B movie from the mostly horrible films the WWE studios puts out. I was dead wrong. Even though what could have been one of the more interesting twists in recent horror movies was given away so carelessly, this movie still packs a decent punch. The Director is Ryuhei Kitamura. He directed his first American movie ""The Midnight Meat Train""(No it's not a porno) starring Bradley Cooper and based on a story by Clive Barker. That movie was visually stunning for the Horror genre and was a okay horror movie thanks to the ""Clive Barker"" aspect. Parts of this movie contain the visual cleverness of ""Midnight Meat Train"", but some parts do look a bit amateurish. Some say because it's supposed to pay homage to 70s Grindhouse movies. I bought this impulsively and decided to save money and just get the cheaper DVD, but now I kinda wish I had bought the Blu-Ray because I would like to have seen how some of the more visual scenes would have looked in HD. Like most horror movies, this is best viewed at night, literally.The first 20 minutes are really good and tension filled. The middle part of the movie slightly goes a bit downhill in the horror aspect. The killer wasn't used to his full potential in some scenes and the editing seemed choppy at times. But it was still full of serial killer tension. Some of the dialogue from the less talented actors ruined some of the middle scenes, but it didn't turn into a disaster. The last 20 minutes is where the movie shines the most. It has action, killing, decent dialogue for a horror movie, a good ending, and a nice soundtrack similar to the Saw theme. The movie had decent horror movie music, but the final scene/credits is where the soundtrack really shines. I think the ending was clich&eacute;, but very well done. Dexter fans, the last 20 minutes might remind you of that show a bit.Luke Evans(Immortals, Fast and Furious 6) does a great job in his sociopath role. Some said he seemed wooden and couldn't act well. That was the way his character is supposed to seem. Wooden and awkward, yet charismatic! He plays a great psychopath! The only other notable performance is Adelaide Clemens(Silent Hill 2) who reminds me of Michelle Williams! She was nice in her ominous role. She is also very pretty. The rest of the cast are decent at best, but still better than B-movie standards.I'm not saying this is better than recent horror movies like ""The Conjuring"", ""Insidious 1 and 2"", or ""You're Next"", but I still think this movie is better than most horror movies that get a wide theatrical release. It was definitely way better than the 2013 Texas Chainsaw Massacre! This had a theatrical run, but barely. ""No One Lives"" has the potential to become a horror cult classic. I hope that the DVD release will expand its audience! This is a good way to spend a boring night when you have nothing else to do. You don't have to buy it, but at least give it a rental.

A group of career criminal thugs happen to cross paths with a real (Serial killer). The criminals make the deadly mistake of pissing him off, and he teaches all (roughnecks) a lesson they will (NOT) live to regret. A great story! Its stunning how well this movie was both written and produced. Its a (5) star movie hands down! There are NO flaws in this movie. It's shockingly good! Its pure entertainment and action all the way through. The sets, props, wardrobes, effects, and acting were spot on. The cinematography was very good. Every aspect of this movie was well managed;it was money well spent and my compliments to all producers involved. Luke Evans, the only (A-list) actor in this movie, carried it very well and gave a hardcore performance that only a seasoned actor could do. However, be warned, this movie is very gruesome and bloody, and the gore factor is very high! This movie is a true masterpiece, and I highly recommend purchase on Blu ray.

We meet a couple who are moving homes; they seem to have everything they need in a trailer and the car they are towing. We learn early on that there has been an issue regarding &#8216;another woman&#8217; that has come between them, but are told no more. Then we meet a gang of &#8216;ruthless highway killers&#8217;. Their panache for unrestrained mayhem is shown early on.Then chance has it that the two groups meet at an isolated diner. Not wanting to miss the opportunity for a fast buck, the gang decide to kidnap the couple. What they think is going to be an easy meal ticket turns out to be something altogether more sinister and the scene is set for a bit of a gore, splat fest with more twists than you can shake a stick at.I did not expect anything from this, but as it started to play I was really hooked (no pun by the way). The acting is all very credible to excellent, Like Evans as the unnamed &#8216;driver&#8217; has smouldering charm and malevolence in equal measures. He says at one point, &#8216;it&#8217;s only in mendacity that we achieve our very best&#8217; &#8211; excellent stuff.
