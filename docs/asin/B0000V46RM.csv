Garza""","[92, 97]","For those who were unable to see VH1's documentary of Zevon's work on his final album, ""The Wind,"" will find themselves fortunate that this DVD is being released.  While not a concert or a collection of videos, this is a big goodbye for Zevon, his family, friends, and fans.The DVD follows Zevon's friend and well-known columnist Dave Barry as he spends a few weeks with the ailing rocker.  The heart of the ""tour"" lies in the recording studio, where we see Zevon jamming with Bruce Springsteen and Dwight Yoakam, discussing songs with Ry Cooder and Billy Bob Thornton, chatting with Hunter S. Thompson.  Inbetween the various clips are updates on Warren's condition; these are bittersweet reminders that a legend is slowly fading.The focus here is entirely on ""The Wind;"" we hear raw clips of ""Disorder in the House"" (Zevond backed by The Boss"" and a closing montage over which ""Keep Me in Your Heart"" plays, the closing track on Zevon's final album--and his life.  It is a musical epitaph which even the most hardened individual will find themselves moved by.  Indeed, it is difficult to keep from feeling a twinge of guilt and sadness when watching this; it is a deeply personal insight into the twilight of a musical genius.  Yet it does end on a somewhat high note; Zevon's daughter gives birth to twins, naming one of them after her father.The DVD will feature the entire VH1 special as well as 65 minutes of ""bonus footage,"" which will undoubtedly be footage left on the cutting-room floor and possibly the two videos for ""Disorder in the House"" and ""Keep Me in Your Heart.""

784458,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B0000V46RM,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[32, 34]","A little over a decade ago, I saw singer/songwriter, Warren Zevon perform in a Maryland night club. It was a huge place, but the audience consisted of me and three other people(one of whom became my future wife). Despite the miniscule turn out, Warren put on one heck of a great rockin' show. It was this memory, that came to mind, when I heard that Zevon had died of a rare form of lung cancer. Now out on DVD is the sad, yet oddly uplifting documentry, ""VH1 (Inside)Out:Warren Zevon"".The copy on the DVD case reads, ""a documentary about the making of the Grammy nominated album THE WIND"", Warren Zevon's final recording"". Yes, the majority of the story takes place during the recording sessions, that Zevon threw himself into once he learned of his disease, but it is about so much more than that.This is a film about a man who is facing his own mortality. Ironically, he is an artist who for over thirty years wrote songs in a humorous vein about death and some of the more destructive vices, that he had engaged in. It is with this good humor and a certain amount of grace, that he approaches what is happening to him. Yes, Zevon admits in the film, that he is very angry inside, because his life is being cut short.But he does not see himself as being heroic and says ""it would be a sin not to want to live"". The film shows a man, who is not only seen playing his music, but is literally playing for time. He makes the most of the precious moments with old friends (including Springsteen, Jackson Browne, Don Henley, Timothy B. Schmit) and his family.It is only fitting then, that among the last tunes the documentary shows Zevon recording is the emotionally moving song ""Keep Me in Your Heart"".One of my favorite moments in the film is footage from ""The Late Show with David Letterman"". In a rather uncharacteristically serious moment, Letterman asks Zevon ""From your perspective now...do you know something about life and death, that I don't know?"" With his typical wit and dry humor Zevon responds, ""Not unless, I know how much your suppose to enjoy every sandwich"". Dosn't that just about say it all?",5,"""Enjoy Every Sandwich!""",1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,2109,"['little', 'decade', 'saw', 'singer/songwriter', 'Warren', 'Zevon', 'perform', 'Maryland', 'night', 'club', 'was', 'huge', 'place', 'audience', 'consisted', 'three', 'other', 'people', 'one', 'whom', 'became', 'future', 'wife', 'miniscule', 'turn', 'out', 'Warren', 'put', 'one', 'heck', 'great', 'rockin', 'show', 'was', 'memory', 'came', 'mind', 'when', 'heard', 'Zevon', 'had', 'died', 'rare', 'form', 'lung', 'cancer', 'Now', 'DVD', 'sad', 'yet', 'oddly', 'uplifting', 'documentry', 'VH1', 'Inside', 'Warren', 'Zevon', '.The', 'copy', 'DVD', 'case', 'documentary', 'making', 'Grammy', 'nominated', 'THE', 'WIND', 'Warren', 'Zevon', 'final', 'recording', 'Yes', 'majority', 'story', 'place', 'recording', 'sessions', 'Zevon', 'threw', 'once', 'learned', 'disease', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'that.This', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'facing', 'own', 'mortality', 'Ironically', 'artist', 'who', 'thirty', 'years', 'wrote', 'songs', 'humorous', 'vein', 'death', 'more', 'destructive', 'vices', 'had', 'engaged', 'good', 'humor', 'certain', 'amount', 'grace', 'what', 'happening', 'Yes', 'Zevon', 'film', 'very', 'angry', 'inside', 'life', 'being', 'cut', 'short.But', 'not', 'see', 'being', 'heroic', 'would', 'be', 'sin', 'not', 'want', 'live', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'seen', 'playing', 'music', 'literally', 'playing', 'time', 'most', 'precious', 'moments', 'old', 'friends', 'including', 'Springsteen', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'Don', 'Henley', 'Timothy', 'B.', 'Schmit', 'family.It', 'only', 'fitting', 'then', 'last', 'tunes', 'documentary', 'Zevon', 'recording', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'song', 'Keep', 'Me', 'Heart', '.One', 'favorite', 'moments', 'film', 'footage', 'Late', 'Show', 'David', 'Letterman', 'rather', 'uncharacteristically', 'serious', 'moment', 'Letterman', 'Zevon', 'perspective', 'now', 'do', 'know', 'something', 'life', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'typical', 'wit', 'dry', 'humor', 'Zevon', 'Not', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'suppose', 'enjoy', 'sandwich', 'Dos', ""n't"", 'that', 'just', 'say']",N/A

This effort is genuinely touching without being the least saccharine.  Warren faced his last months with courage, grace, and a last surge of creative genius, and we are the richer for it.I'm hoping that someone will come up with a documentary (and/or a book biography) exploring Warren Zevon's entire &quot;dirty life and times.&quot;  He came of age in Los Angeles at a time when the music industry there was enormously prolific, and it would be of great interest to know more about Zevon's astonishingly durable web of friendship, his good times and bad ones as well.",5,Keeping him in my heart...,1078444800,"03 5, 2004",2004,724,"['When', 'Warren', 'Zevon', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'decided', 'make', 'one', 'last', 'album', 'quot', 'Wind', 'quot', 'process', 'documented', 'DVD', 'effort', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'being', 'least', 'saccharine', 'Warren', 'faced', 'last', 'months', 'courage', 'grace', 'last', 'surge', 'creative', 'genius', 'are', 'richer', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'someone', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'documentary', 'and/or', 'book', 'biography', 'exploring', 'Warren', 'Zevon', 'entire', 'quot', 'dirty', 'life', 'times.', 'quot', 'came', 'age', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'time', 'when', 'music', 'industry', 'was', 'enormously', 'prolific', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'interest', 'know', 'more', 'Zevon', 'astonishingly', 'durable', 'web', 'friendship', 'good', 'times', 'bad', 'ones', 'well']",N/A

It's great to finally have that documentary available on DVD, but the additional footage is a bit disappointing.  I was hoping they would show more of Warren's last appearance on the David Letterman show, and include a complete performance of at least one song from that, but they didn't.  Also, it was hard to hear the interviewer in some of the bonus interview footage.  On the plus side, the music videos for the songs &quot;Keep Me In Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Disorder In The House&quot; are excellent.  It's also a treat to watch Bruce Springsteen playing all of his guitar part, including two sizzling solos, for the song &quot;Disorder In The House,&quot; while Warren watches in amazement.  Warren Zevon touched a lot of lives and made a lot of famous friends.  Several of them made guest appearances on his last album, including Jackson Browne, Ry Cooder, Don Henley, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh and the aforementioned Bruce Springsteen.  My hope is that their experience of working with Warren will motivate them and other great musicians to participate in a tribute album to Warren Zevon.",4,Dirty Life And Times,1077408000,"02 22, 2004",2004,1222,"['VH1', 'broadcast', 'outstanding', 'documentary', 'Warren', 'Zevon', 'making', 'album', 'quot', 'Wind', 'quot', 'was', 'terminally', 'ill', 'great', 'finally', 'have', 'documentary', 'available', 'DVD', 'additional', 'footage', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'show', 'more', 'Warren', 'last', 'appearance', 'David', 'Letterman', 'show', 'include', 'complete', 'performance', 'least', 'one', 'song', 'did', ""n't"", 'Also', 'was', 'hard', 'hear', 'interviewer', 'bonus', 'interview', 'footage', 'plus', 'side', 'music', 'videos', 'songs', 'quot', 'Keep', 'Me', 'Your', 'Heart', 'quot', 'quot', 'Disorder', 'House', 'quot', 'are', 'excellent', 'also', 'treat', 'watch', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'playing', 'guitar', 'part', 'including', 'two', 'sizzling', 'solos', 'song', 'quot', 'Disorder', 'House', 'quot', 'Warren', 'watches', 'amazement', 'Warren', 'Zevon', 'touched', 'lot', 'lives', 'made', 'lot', 'famous', 'friends', 'Several', 'made', 'guest', 'appearances', 'last', 'album', 'including', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'Ry', 'Cooder', 'Don', 'Henley', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Joe', 'Walsh', 'aforementioned', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'hope', 'experience', 'working', 'Warren', 'will', 'motivate', 'other', 'great', 'musicians', 'participate', 'tribute', 'album', 'Warren', 'Zevon']",N/A
