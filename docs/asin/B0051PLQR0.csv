My initail take-away was that SUPER is sort of a blacky comedic homage to Martin Scorsese's 1976 classicTaxi Driver (Collector's Edition), although there are numerous allusions to other late 20th century films and graphic novels, most notablyWatchmen. Apparently this film has been stuck in development hell since the early 2000s, but it serves as a textbook example of why this isn't always a bad thing - screenwriter/director James Gunn has clearly had time to think about exactly what kind of film he wanted to make and to put together exactly the team he wanted to make that film.Conclusion: This film is certainly not for everyone (honestly, it's just far too esoteric to appeal to most people) but if my little capsule review above has you even a little bit intrigued, then I highly, highly recommend it.",5,TAXI DRIVER As Black Comedy,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,877,"['Just', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'initail', 'take-away', 'was', 'SUPER', 'sort', 'blacky', 'comedic', 'homage', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', '1976', 'classicTaxi', 'Driver', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'are', 'numerous', 'allusions', 'other', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'films', 'graphic', 'novels', 'most', 'notablyWatchmen', 'Apparently', 'film', 'been', 'stuck', 'development', 'hell', 'early', '2000s', 'textbook', 'example', 'why', ""n't"", 'always', 'bad', 'thing', 'screenwriter/director', 'James', 'Gunn', 'clearly', 'had', 'time', 'think', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'wanted', 'make', 'put', 'together', 'exactly', 'team', 'wanted', 'make', 'film.Conclusion', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'honestly', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'esoteric', 'appeal', 'most', 'people', 'little', 'capsule', 'review', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'intrigued', 'then', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

1437070,A2W75RZ6WA9DCN,B0051PLQR0,"Banon ""IronMan004""","[1, 1]","James Gunn&#8217;s Super is a dark, twisted, and excessively violent satire of the &#8220;real world&#8221; superhero. It&#8217;s less of a parody however, and more of a bizarre character study about a deeply depressed and disturbed individual. The idea of the superhero doesn&#8217;t really enter into what&#8217;s wrong with Frank, but merely serves as an outlet for his suppressed aggression and homicidal frustration with his own life.The story opens with an intro to the sorry state that is the life of Frank Darrbo (Rainn Wilson). He&#8217;s a fryer at a local burger joint, he&#8217;s married to Sarah (Liv Tyler), a recovering addict, and his life is mostly a series of humiliations. His two crowning achievements are his marriage and that one time when he pointed out which way a criminal ran to a cop. Sarah soon relapses into her habits, coinciding with her meeting Jacques (Kevin Bacon), a drug dealer. She leaves Frank, sending him into a further downward spiral resulting in what&#8217;s probably best described as a horrific episode, eventually culminating in his donning a homemade superhero costume and calling himself the Crimson Bolt, a patchwork looking vigilante who mercilessly clubs his enemies with a pipe wrench.Like other films in this &#8220;real life&#8221; superhero subgenre, such as Kick-Ass or Defendor, there&#8217;s a dark sense of humor to accompany the expectations of the action scenes. The Crimson Bolt spends the first few nights hiding behind a dumpster and encountering little crime other than the evidence of littering. When he expands his territory into an actual dangerous neighborhood, we get a surprisingly upbeat montage of him brutally assaulting criminals of various kinds in ways that could leave them dead or crippled. I mean he lays down some savage beatings on people with that wrench. The violence and bloodshed only escalates when he teams up with his comic geek admirer Libby (Ellen Page), who joins him in his crusade as his &#8220;kid&#8221; sidekick, Boltie. Between his delusions and her sadism, they do quite a bit of damage with absolutely no negative consequences from the police.Even though the general tone is that of a comedy, it tends to warp and twist almost as dramatically as the mental state of Frank himself. It&#8217;s made clear early on that Frank is not only delusional, but clearly disturbed. He has a history of seeing things, cannot communicate well with others, and suppresses a lot of rage at the world and the life he feels he was unfairly dealt. His depression is at times not humorous at all and taken surprisingly serious, while the next scene could include him smashing someone&#8217;s head in complete with cartoony sound effects animated onscreen &agrave; la the Adam West Batman series. There&#8217;s a consistent morbid humor, which is evident by the gleeful presentation of horrific violence, but it clashes with the emotional drama of the character.Around the time Boltie makes her debut, the movie hits its stride, and even though she&#8217;s completely psychotic and deranged (possibly more so than Frank), Ellen Page laughing manically as she brutally attacks someone is admittedly (albeit oddly) hilarious. She really has some fun with this role and it&#8217;s difficult not to like her. The rest of the acting is really strong as well, especially from Rainn Wilson, who shows a surprising amount of range both comedically and dramatically.Unfortunately after its climax, which almost becomes a clich&eacute;d action sequence (though Frank&#8217;s insanity prevents it from being one entirely), it has a strangely hopeful ending, with a tacked on &#8220;lesson learned&#8221; as if there was always some greater meaning to Frank&#8217;s journey. It comes across as disingenuous and doesn&#8217;t match the depravity of the characters up until that point, which is the entire movie. That any sort of catharsis could be found at the end of this madness seems almost like a cheat or a copout.Writer/director James Gunn&#8217;s directing is highly stylized and erratic, given what we get on the screen. At times there&#8217;s some surrealist imagery, at others more conventional comedy/parody (any scene with the Christian superhero Holy Avenger (Nathan Fillion) is pretty great), and at others, ludicrously gory action. The way he films the violence, from the upbeat montages to the more conventional finale, makes the assaults and blood spilling seem like some sort of release for the characters. It&#8217;s often shocking, but we are encouraged to enjoy the scenes where Crimson Bolt crushes a man&#8217;s skull or Boltie stabs someone repeatedly while laughing maniacally. There&#8217;s an odd sense of sadistic glee in the action scenes, and when coupled with the delusional mind of the protagonist it left a strange taste in my mouth.Super is an odd, and often disturbing story that goes so far in any direction it&#8217;s leaning towards. There are genuinely funny moments, and there&#8217;s also some dramatic subtext for the characters and their skewed motivations, but this only makes the ridiculous and over-the-top graphic violence seem all the more shocking. While I can&#8217;t very well say this is a great movie (it&#8217;s a mixed bag at best, depending on your tastes), I can&#8217;t deny that I found it strangely enjoyable, too.",4,"An odd gem, of

1437072,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0051PLQR0,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Super is about a man (Rainn Wilson) who has his girlfriend (played by the always gorgeous Liv Tyler) taken from him one day thanks to Kevin Bacon and his gang, so Rainn sets out to become a superhero and protect all that is good and right while ultimately building up a plan to rescue Liv Tyler.  Along the way, he meets up with Ellen Page at a comic book store and she eventually becomes his sidekick.What's interesting is the way this type of superhero film is portrayed.  It's basically an EXTREMELY violent mockery of the ficitional good guy superhero theme that we've all seen in several comic books but with TONS of blood, weapons, and brutal deaths around every corner.  As a result, and in addition to the constant swearing and sexual-related segments, it's not recommended for children.  I mean this movie actually SHOWS all these touchy subjects in a most intense manner.Anyway Kevin Bacon's gang basically spends the entire time drugging and using Liv Tyler for sex while Rainn Wilson comes up with the perfect plan to put a sudden stop to this nonsense.  It's funny that the moral of the story is to do what's right, but the way it happens is through an excruciatingly graphic amount of violence.  The scenes that show Ellen Page laughing and joking after murdering the bad guys... it's almost too much.  It's unusual and not for everyone's tastes, that's for sure.  It's hard to suggest such a thing is funny when the laughs are suddenly and shockingly exchanged for a more tasteless type of overbearingly graphic nonsense.Still, if one were to ignore the graphic nature, a well-written and easy to understand plot lies underneath all this brutality.  Whether you're a superhero fan or not (and I'm not) I recommend Super for anybody that admires dark comedies.  Of course there's plotholes galore but when you think about it, this is the same situation with comic books so perhaps the portrayal of characters in Super is totally accurate.  It seems the cops are always late to the scene or unaware of an important situation when it occurs, so nothing ever happens when it should.",5,super duper,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,2093,"['Super', 'man', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'always', 'gorgeous', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'taken', 'one', 'day', 'thanks', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'gang', 'so', 'Rainn', 'out', 'become', 'superhero', 'protect', 'good', 'right', 'while', 'ultimately', 'building', 'up', 'plan', 'rescue', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'way', 'up', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'comic', 'book', 'store', 'eventually', 'sidekick.What', 'interesting', 'way', 'type', 'superhero', 'film', 'portrayed', 'basically', 'EXTREMELY', 'violent', 'mockery', 'ficitional', 'good', 'guy', 'superhero', 'theme', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'comic', 'books', 'TONS', 'blood', 'weapons', 'brutal', 'deaths', 'corner', 'result', 'addition', 'constant', 'swearing', 'sexual-related', 'segments', 'not', 'recommended', 'children', 'mean', 'movie', 'actually', 'SHOWS', 'touchy', 'subjects', 'most', 'intense', 'manner.Anyway', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'gang', 'basically', 'entire', 'time', 'drugging', 'using', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'sex', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'up', 'perfect', 'plan', 'put', 'sudden', 'stop', 'nonsense', 'funny', 'moral', 'story', 'do', 'what', ""'s"", 'right', 'way', 'excruciatingly', 'graphic', 'amount', 'violence', 'scenes', 'show', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'laughing', 'joking', 'murdering', 'bad', 'guys', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'unusual', 'not', 'everyone', 'tastes', 'sure', 'hard', 'suggest', 'thing', 'funny', 'when', 'laughs', 'are', 'suddenly', 'shockingly', 'exchanged', 'more', 'tasteless', 'type', 'overbearingly', 'graphic', 'nonsense.Still', 'one', 'were', 'ignore', 'graphic', 'nature', 'well-written', 'easy', 'understand', 'plot', 'brutality', ""'re"", 'superhero', 'fan', 'not', ""'m"", 'not', 'recommend', 'Super', 'anybody', 'dark', 'comedies', 'course', 'plotholes', 'galore', 'when', 'think', 'same', 'situation', 'comic', 'books', 'perhaps', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'Super', 'totally', 'accurate', 'cops', 'are', 'always', 'late', 'scene', 'unaware', 'important', 'situation', 'when', 'nothing', 'ever', 'when', 'should']",N/A

There were religious bits, that I can only imagine were to make Rainn Wilson look as crazy as he was acting. It was certainly not Super, except for Super disturbing.

There is a new super hero in town, and he is ready to bash his way through the skulls of injustice with his pipe wrench of truth! James Gunn returns with another explosive cult-comedy starring Rainn Wilson as The Crimson Bolt, a self-made super hero that takes up crime-fighting after a seedy drug dealer makes off with his wife. Together with the help of his trusty side-kick, Boltie, they will squash evil in all of its many forms! In a James Gunn film, that includes beating people senseless over minor indiscretions like butting in line and keying cars, naturally. Gunn pulls no punches when it comes to crass, irreverent humor and exploitative violence, taking each to their veritable extremes while hiding behind the guise of a super hero film. Dig deep enough, and there are many powerful themes at work that speak directly towards the concept of the vigilante super hero and the essence of right and wrong. Rainn Wilson embodies the role of our deranged hero perfectly, providing an equal balance of sad ineptitude with never-ending hope and courage. Ellen Page's foul-mouthed Boltie adds an entertaining mix as well, when she is not taking the role too far over the top.

1437079,A2Z4B0VALQL9CC,B0051PLQR0,Cheese Steak Jimmy,"[2, 5]","Whilst this movie has been compared to Mark Millar'sKick-Ass, it doesn't have a lot in common with it, bearing more coincidental similarity to the excellentSpecialandDefendor(the similarities being coincidental because James Gunn has been nursing this pet project for around a decade, since around the time he and his brother were involved with the similarly excellentThe Specials). Whilst Kick Ass purported to ask the question 'what would happen if someone really tried to be a superhero?', it instead started as a spoof on Raimi's Spider-Man movies, before morphing into fairly standard super-hero power-fantasy, albeit spiced up with the addition of a 13-year-old potty-mouthed assassin that chewed up the scenery and stole the movie.Super also has it's deranged female sidekick, but Ellen Page's unhinged take on 'Boltie' compliments the outstanding Rainn Wilson --who plays the Crimson Bolt-- without completely stealing the show (probably due to the fact that both lead characters are borderline personality-disorder types with psychotic issues). Indeed the ensemble cast are excellent, with Gunn roping in Liv Tyler, Kevin Bacon, Gregg Henry, and Michael Rooker, to flesh out a very low budget movie.While this movie might seem like it's interested in asking all those post-Watchmen deconstruction questions about what 'real superheroes' would be like, Gunn doesn't play it like this at all. In fact, this movie feels more like a really twisted ritalin-powered fairytale, and at points reminded me of the sort of excrutiatingly cringing humor ofThe Foot Fist Waycrossed withTaxi Driver. Super clips along at a fast pace and is punctuated by brutal violence, but its tongue remains firmly in its cheek as cartoon 'pows' overlay a fair chunk of the carnage (a la the 1960s Adam West Batman). Gunn even manages to hint at a bit of character development for the main characters in amongst the carnage, and throws in a bit of a religious subtext as well.All in all, if you like bubblegum-pop gonzo movies that burst at the seams with ideas, and aren't put off by the occasional explosion of extreme brutality, then Super is highly recommended.",5,Another excellent entry into the burgeoning 'loser becomes superhero' mini-genre,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,2146,"['movie', 'been', 'compared', 'Mark', ""Millar'sKick-Ass"", ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'bearing', 'more', 'coincidental', 'similarity', 'excellentSpecialandDefendor', 'similarities', 'being', 'coincidental', 'James', 'Gunn', 'been', 'nursing', 'pet', 'project', 'decade', 'time', 'brother', 'were', 'involved', 'similarly', 'excellentThe', 'Specials', 'Whilst', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'purported', 'ask', 'question', 'would', 'happen', 'someone', 'really', 'tried', 'be', 'superhero', 'instead', 'started', 'spoof', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'movies', 'morphing', 'fairly', 'standard', 'super-hero', 'power-fantasy', 'albeit', 'spiced', 'up', 'addition', '13-year-old', 'potty-mouthed', 'assassin', 'chewed', 'up', 'scenery', 'stole', 'movie.Super', 'also', 'deranged', 'female', 'sidekick', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'unhinged', 'take', ""'Boltie"", 'compliments', 'outstanding', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'who', 'Crimson', 'Bolt', 'completely', 'stealing', 'show', 'probably', 'due', 'fact', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'borderline', 'personality-disorder', 'types', 'psychotic', 'issues', 'Indeed', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent', 'Gunn', 'roping', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Gregg', 'Henry', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'flesh', 'out', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'movie.While', 'movie', 'might', 'seem', 'interested', 'asking', 'post-Watchmen', 'deconstruction', 'questions', 'what', ""'real"", 'superheroes', 'would', 'be', 'Gunn', ""n't"", 'play', 'fact', 'movie', 'more', 'really', 'twisted', 'ritalin-powered', 'fairytale', 'points', 'reminded', 'sort', 'excrutiatingly', 'cringing', 'humor', 'ofThe', 'Foot', 'Fist', 'Waycrossed', 'withTaxi', 'Driver', 'Super', 'along', 'fast', 'pace', 'punctuated', 'brutal', 'violence', 'tongue', 'firmly', 'cheek', 'cartoon', ""'pows"", 'overlay', 'fair', 'chunk', 'carnage', 'la', '1960s', 'Adam', 'West', 'Batman', 'Gunn', 'even', 'hint', 'bit', 'character', 'development', 'main', 'characters', 'amongst', 'carnage', 'bit', 'religious', 'subtext', 'well.All', 'like', 'bubblegum-pop', 'gonzo', 'movies', 'burst', 'seams', 'ideas', 'are', ""n't"", 'put', 'off', 'occasional', 'explosion', 'extreme', 'brutality', 'then', 'Super', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

This movie is almost what would amount to a modern day troma movie with it's senseless killing and psychopathic supposedly good main characters and you feel almost dirty after watching it......by the way I love the old Troma movies. I felt bad for Wilson and his depressing life and I really did care about the character he played until the movie went of the deep end. When Liv Tyler left him he should have just moved on, instead around 10-15 people where killed for a drug attic. Well I must say Liv is one of the most gorgeous actresses to me and I would have done the same thing if I was in Wilson's shoes I would have just been much more direct and without the costume........but thats besides the point here we are talking about the movie not me lol lol. And the scene where boltie wants to seduce Wilson made me feel really uncomfortable and gross I cringed when I watched it. I kept watching though thinking maybe the movie would reedeem itself somehow, Then and most disturbing of all to me little Boltie gets half of her face blown off witch was very disturbing and disheartening to me. She was just a little lunatic looking for a little bit of excitement outside her comic book job. I felt this movie was done in bad taste and it was done that way from the start and purposely.

""Defendor"" and ""Kick-Ass"" come to mind quickly and they all have similar themes. They deal with guys who feel impotent with the injustices they see around them and want to do something about it so they transform into super heroes.""Super"" is not different at it's core but way different in its execution. Here you have Rainn Wilson as a milquetoast short order cook who has lost his wife to drugs and the local strip club owner. He figures God has told him to fight back so he designs his ""Red Bolt"" costume and goes out to right the wrongs and get his woman back. Along the way he acquires Ellen Paige as his side kick and things go pretty far south.In ""Defendor"" and Kick-Ass"" you have similar hapless heroes who often overcome their prey in rather innocuous and sometimes accidentally humorous ways. They take their lumps but somehow manage to prevail. Here the viewer experiences some hard core violence. Red Bolt's weapon is a pipe wrench for crying out loud, and you see him wield it in all his bloody glory. Watching him put it through someone's skull is truly frightening. And people get shot and killed at fairly regular intervals as well. What starts out as somewhat of a comic undertaking evolves into some true horror. And then there's Ellen Paige as his side kick. See gets a sexual charge when they dish out the mayhem. She's beside herself with excitement.This is at least part of the message at the movie's core. These two dish out the same punishment to someone who cuts in line as they do to a drug dealer. Neither seems to understand the difference in degree and it ends up costing them dearly.There are a couple of major holes in the plot but I didn't care. The message seemed to override them. And the ending seemed fitting to me. The budget is decent with much of it seemingly spent on the cast. Rainn Wilson, Ellen Paige, Liv Tyler and Kevin Bacon are all heavy hitters and they do a great job here. The camerawork, sound and editing are good enough to get you from A to Z but they take a back seat to the content.This is a dark and emotionally confusing movie.

The last Rain Wilson film I saw was HESHER and that absolutely rocked so I thought I will give this one a viewing. Where do I even begin? The one thing that baffles me the most is whether I saw the film as most of the people here writing reviews. The film has a premise alright but the actors are just so annoying and ordinary, it is like watching at best ""an attempt at a film"" Now I understand one must give credit to the film-makers because apparently a lot of people liked this film but seriously? I read a review that said this film is a bit like Pulp Fiction , Natural Born KIlers and some other film. Another review said this and Kick Ass should be played together in sequence. Another review said that everything about the film was perfect and touching. What?! I rated this film two stars because that is all that it deserves. I can't believe Ellen Page played the character she did in the film, that of a bored 22 year old comic vendor lacking excitement in her life. Wilson should never bother playing the lead role again, he was a little disturbing to watch. The film didn't have any funny moments, Kevin Bacon who plays a villain couldn't deliver one dialogue straight. I'm seeing Liv Tyler in a film after a long time and there is absolutely no substance or taking away quality in her role.Bad story, mediocre direction, there does seem to be a flow to things but I seriously would get absolutely no joy in asking you to watch this film if you're looking for a comedy.I think of all the people who are going to buy the dvd for this film and wonder if they're crazy.Wanna watch something funny? Watch ""Everything must go"" , ""Napoleon Dynamite"" , ""Cedar Rapids"" , ""Cyrus"" , ""Step Brothers"" , ""Hesher"" but seriously watch the trailer before watching this film.

Some dude in spandex finds out he has a new power, finds out how to control it, then fights Dr. Count Evil of Doomtopia, rinse, repeat.Super, on the other hand, is similar to the story of Defendor & Kick-Ass where a normal guy decides to take a stand against crime without the gift of superpowers. Whereas Kick-Ass was made for babies and Defendor took itself a little too seriously, Super finds the perfect balance between dark comedy and seriousness. We follow Frank who's wife recently left him for a charismatic drug dealer played by Kevin Bacon. Frank deeply loves his wife and has a frightenely strict mindset that everyone should follow the rules to a capital R. When law enforcement fails to help him on his personal problem he takes it upon himself to make crime 'shut up'. As you can tell Frank, like his wrench, ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. So while his heart's in the right place his delivery is psychotic. Frank gets his mind literally torn open and touched by God, which just goes to show this vigalante isn't exactly sane.What made Super work for me so well was how it jumped from psychotic hilarity to some really dark subject matters, and it all worked, none of it felt forced. Frank eventually meets a similarily psychotic individual named Boltie (Ellen Page) and together they terroriz-I mean help people. As this plays out Frank's main goal is to save his ex-wife from Kevin Bacon, which he goes about without one hint of thought or consequence, he purely acts on emotion even though he believes in firm justice; this is the Crimson Bolt's inner conflict that makes him misunderstood (rightfully so).How things play out is interesting, it wavers between realistic and unrealistic which I liked, Defendor played everything out a little too realistically for me and it seemed like Defendor couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a drama. Super on the other hand just shoves both into a blender and chugs the results, making for a much more entertaining experience. All of the actors are good, but Rainn Wilson stands out here from his usual roles, he shows his conflicted side very well and I actually felt happy for him by the end not many actors can get me involved.Overall Super is a superhero movie for people who don't like conventional superhero movies, it's a weird little indie flick that is hard to recommend to many people but for the audience it's geared towards, it delivers in spades.P.S.

1437096,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B0051PLQR0,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[2, 4]","Hollywood has become a tame animal this past decade. I don't know if it's because the directors that used to push the envelope like Kevin Smith, Peter Jackson, and Brad Anderson became more mainstream, or the audience just decided to glaze over and enjoy comfort film, but Hollywood went with it.So it's not that surprising that when two movies with the same premise of a normal Joe Schmo fighting crime, Super and Kick-Ass, came out, Hollywood went with the movie with a safe, MARVEL audience looking for a straight-up action movie. Unfortunately, it left fans looking for Super in limited release theaters and waiting for the movie to hit DVD shelves. Luckily, it was well worth the wait.The plot of Super is not the story of your basic super-hero. Frank D'Arbo (played by Rainn Wilson) is a simple, religious short-order cook at a diner that is married to a beautiful recovering drug -addict Sarah (played by Liv Tyler). His two greatest achievements, or as he calls them, perfect moments, is marrying Sarah and pointing a police officer in the direction of a criminal. One day, Sarah leaves Frank for local crime-lord Jacques (played by Kevin Bacon). Frank can't handle it, and goes to the cops, who  show him up, then Jacques, whose thugs beat the crap out of him.After a long bout of prayer, Frank is inspired to become a super-hero, The Crimson Bolt, beating up drug dealers, child molesters, and line-cutters with his trusty pipe-wrench. He later teams up with hot comic-book geek Libby (played by Ellen Page), who becomes Boltie and helps him take on crime and fight Jacques and his henchmen to save Sarah.The movie is quite deeper than that. This awkward super-hero story has some in-your-face blood squirts, blown apart bodies, and a ""touched by God"" scene that would make any Troma fan remember why they loved James Gunn. It's entertaining, goofy gore rather than disgusting. At the same time, there is a layer of comedy throughout the film that straddles the fence of slapstick and black comedy, more than just the campy Holy Avenger references with James Gunn as the Devil. It can be as simple as the joke of beating the crap out of someone for cutting in line(bringing up memories of RoboCop 2), or as creepy as a super-hero yelling at a criminal like a little kid before stabbing him to death.The depth of the movie takes on a few serious themes as well. For one, dependence, both emotional and drug-related, as is shown in the marriage of Frank and Sarah. The second is how true love is when you want someone to be truly happy, whether or not you are actually a part of that happy life. These themes do take a while to emerge in the film, but it works because it makes sure the movie does not get too heavy at the beginning. Later on, the emergence of these themes give this movie just the right depth to be an arguably awesome movie.Of course, Ellen Page as a hot comic book geek getting dressed up in a super-hero outfit and abusing criminals may demean that depth.However, Page's Libby plays the role of separating lust from love. Not that the stoic Frank really needs that, simpleton that he is, but it helps the audience realize this themselves: Frank, true love, and honor become the aspects of life: Frank as The Crimson Bolt become a split personality of lust, violence, and redemption, all of which are aspects of fantasy.

I'd seen Slither when it first came out on video, but I can't remember any of it. I haven't seen any of Gunn's other work, but his writing has never been top notch (the Scooby Doo movies, some Troma stuff & The Specials kind of round it out)...needless to say, I went in giving Gunn a pretty clean slate. His cast consists of Rainn Wilson (who will always be Dwight to me), Juno, and Kevin Bacon. Wilson does a great job and Bacon steals the show, successfully chewing every bit of scene that he's in, but Ellen Page is godawful in this movie. She's like the little kid running around in the supermarket that you think about whacking in the face when his parent has her back turned, then pretending that he ran into your shopping cart. She's constantly laughing and shrieking, and generally just acts like a six year old who's had too much rock candy.The plot is fairly simple...guy's ex-junkie wife gets turned back to drugs, and in response, he creates an alter-ego to lash out at his world. The tone is pretty depressing and many of the scenes are downright insane (seeing a vision in his barf, which is circling the toilet bowl). The level of gore in this movie is amazing, which was alright with me (an unabashed fan of over the top violence), but the woman had to close her eyes quite a few times - this flick is not for the squeamish. Heads and limbs get blown off and blood squirts.I liked this movie, but I didn't love this movie. For my money, Kick-Ass (while heavily debated on the internet) was superior. This movie does a lot of things right - doesn't shy away from violence, Kevin Bacon as a villain (can we have more of that?), and a few good ""Whaaaa?"" moments keep it afloat...but it also does a lot of things wrong - it's dark and depressing, Ellen Page's acting, and a weak script keep it from being a great superhero movie.Score: 3 stars.",3,Super...until Juno shows up.,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,1948,"['Super', 'was', 'born', 'mind', 'James', 'Gunn', 'who', 'highly', 'regarded', 'work', 'Slither', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Slither', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'video', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Gunn', 'other', 'work', 'writing', 'never', 'been', 'top', 'notch', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'movies', 'Troma', 'stuff', 'Specials', 'kind', 'round', 'out', 'needless', 'say', 'went', 'giving', 'Gunn', 'pretty', 'clean', 'slate', 'cast', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'who', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Dwight', 'Juno', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Wilson', 'great', 'job', 'Bacon', 'show', 'successfully', 'chewing', 'bit', 'scene', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'godawful', 'movie', 'little', 'kid', 'running', 'around', 'supermarket', 'think', 'whacking', 'face', 'when', 'parent', 'back', 'turned', 'then', 'pretending', 'ran', 'shopping', 'cart', 'constantly', 'laughing', 'shrieking', 'generally', 'just', 'acts', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'rock', 'candy.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simple', 'guy', 'ex-junkie', 'wife', 'turned', 'back', 'drugs', 'response', 'alter-ego', 'lash', 'out', 'world', 'tone', 'pretty', 'depressing', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'downright', 'insane', 'seeing', 'vision', 'barf', 'circling', 'toilet', 'bowl', 'level', 'gore', 'movie', 'amazing', 'was', 'alright', 'unabashed', 'fan', 'top', 'violence', 'woman', 'had', 'close', 'eyes', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'flick', 'not', 'squeamish', 'Heads', 'limbs', 'get', 'blown', 'off', 'blood', 'squirts.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'movie', 'money', 'Kick-Ass', 'heavily', 'debated', 'internet', 'was', 'superior', 'movie', 'lot', 'things', 'right', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'violence', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'villain', 'can', 'have', 'more', 'few', 'good', 'Whaaaa', 'keep', 'afloat', 'also', 'lot', 'things', 'wrong', 'dark', 'depressing', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'acting', 'weak', 'script', 'keep', 'being', 'great', 'superhero', 'movie.Score', '3', 'stars']",N/A

1437103,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0051PLQR0,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 7]","Frank D'Arbo (Rainn Wilson) is a hapless short-order cook living in a small town with his wife Sarah (Liv Tyler), a recovering drug addict. In an opening voice-over, Frank explains that, including his marriage to Sarah, he's only had two perfect moments in his life amidst endless humiliation. One day, Frank returns home to find that Sarah has left him for Jacques (Kevin Bacon), a strip club owner and drug dealer. After attempting to get Sarah back from Jacques and getting beaten by Jacques' entourage, Frank sits at home in the depths of depression watching the All-Jesus Network, which sparks a vision that leads Frank to believe God wants him to fight the forces of evil by becoming a superhero. Armed with a pipe wrench and calling himself the Crimson Bolt, Frank begins violently attacking criminals in his small-town which attracts the attention of the media and a young, overzealous comic-book store clerk named Libby (Ellen Page).Written and directed by James Gunn, Super is an exercise in defying audience expectation. With Rainn Wilson from The Office leading the cast, Super looks like an innocent send-up of the comic-book movie genre, 2010's Kick-Ass by way of Juno. Underneath the veil of dark comedy, it's actually a disturbing character study that has more in common with Buffalo '66 by way of Lynch. The film begins like an innocently downbeat indie comedy, but abruptly veers into a different direction that will leave some viewers with a total aversion to it. It's easy to imagine clueless people renting the film expecting a light comedy and angrily demanding their money back. I went into Super expecting the same thing and was stunned by what I got instead. My reaction to this film was much stronger than I could or would have anticipated.In his two-star review for it, Roger Ebert said ""[Super] begins as the portrait of a loveable loser named Frank, and as it ends, we're pretty sure he's an insane ruthless killer."" In that sense, Super functions as a showcase for Wilson's ability as an actor and comedian. He's found success on The Office, but has yet to make his mark in theatrical films. Here, he strays drastically from his beloved television persona and creates a disturbing portrait of a very troubled character. Wilson has a gift for always seeming sincere which benefits both the comedic and dramatic elements of his performance. His sincerity makes his character easier to empathize with, as he seems to genuinely believe in his cause and it assists the comedic elements because he never seems like he's trying to be funny and his delivery makes you question whether you're supposed to laugh or be frightened. It's a brilliant performance of surprising power, filled with both pathos and hilarity. Meanwhile, Ellen Page, building an increasingly impressive resume, gives a performance unlike any she's given before. Initially, Libby seems like a sweet, nave young girl, attracted to the adventurous aspect of what Frank is doing while blissfully unaware of his possible insanity. Her layered performance is full of energy and enthusiasm, with a darkness that makes you question whether she's as crazy as Frank is. Her character can be annoying, but it's intentional and I don't know if she's ever seemed more...adorable. Kevin Bacon brings a suave, snake-like charm to Jacques and displays a perfect sense of comedic timing, especially in his rapport with Wilson. Finally, there's Michael Rooker (looking a lot like Harvey Keitel these days) as one of Jacques' more sympathetic goons.Super is about as dark as comedies get without falling into a different genre. It's so dark in fact that some may deny there's any humor in it at all. It does have a very mean spirited, perverse, and uncomfortable sense of humor that will make you laugh hysterically one moment and be squirming in your seat the next. Or you may just stare blankly at the screen. This could have been a one-note joke, but since it transcends the ""dark comedy"" genre it finds a perfect balance in what it does and creates humor that never feels forced. The film's tone, characterized by a grayish setting and color palette suggest a sense of dread and despair early on, yet the film maintains a warped indie sensibility that provides stark contrast with what you'd expect from the film and what you ultimately get. Gunn successfully takes his audience from one extreme of the genre to the next and puts his audience's emotions through the wringer while watching his film. It seems so rare lately that I find myself so emotionally invested in a film.The film is very well-directed with handheld camera-work and an indie music score that clearly identifies it as an independent feature, but doesn't make it look cheap. In a creative move, the use of random 2D animation appearing throughout the film is put to good use, at times recalling the old Batman TV series. Gunn really shows himself to be a fearless filmmaker with a strong grip over his material. His script goes into very dark places, but never betrays or double-backs on what it has started and fearlessly walks head-on into a territory that most directors would never tread. Despite how disconnected from the mainstream it is, I expected Gunn to betray everything and end his film in formulaic Hollywood fashion, which he wisely doesn't.It's a film of surprising power and impact, a pitch black comedy that is as disturbing as it is funny. The average person becoming a superhero has almost become its own sub-genre, but the handling of the material creates something very original. The film knows exactly what it wants to achieve and remains consistent in the way the story plays out and is remarkably moving, despite the strong violence and psychologically troubled characters. Finally, it's a very memorable film in the way it doesn't manipulate any aspects of plot and character in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience. This film really came out of nowhere and made a startling impression on me. I can't promise that you'll like it, or respond to the material the same way I did. In fact, I can promise that a good many of you will hate it, but Super appealed to me emotionally while functioning as mere entertainment. I admire a film that really draws me in with its originality and characters and Super is a film that I found surprising, effective, and (forgive me for saying) super.GRADE: A",5,"A Brilliant, Dark,

1437104,A2HEV2DBHZX6P4,B0051PLQR0,J Petrille,"[0, 2]","I think some people are reading into this movie a bit much.  There is no overarching social commentary.  Think of this as Watchmen Redux.The point of Watchmen is to take comic books out of their rarefied world and place them in a real-world context.  If superheroes existed, what would their economic situation be?  What would their politics be?  *Super* strips out the politics and the social commentary but leaves the delusion and the violence.I tend to think that violence in movies is a bit of a cop-out.

1437107,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B0051PLQR0,Kevin F. Tasker,"[5, 8]","Teaming up once more after a 4 year haitus, Rainn Wilson and Ellen Page play quite a different couple than they did in 2007's indie teen pregnancy-smash Juno. Their relationship this time around is more ""inappropriate"", as Wilson's ""Crimson Bolt"" (or more, appropriately, his self-loathing alter-ego Frank) might put it. Before the movie is over, Page takes control of Wilson in ways that won't be printed here both for fear of ruining some surprises and probably alienating some friendly Amazon readers. The relationship between the hapless and largely unhinged Frank and the cute/absolutely sociopathic (and ruthlessly salacious) sidekick Boltie is only one of the specific elements of James Gunn's film that leave a lacerating and darkly humorous impression for days after.The film's principle arc is a simple revenge/improvement-of-self plot. Rainn Wilson is fed up with getting peed on--figuratively and literally, as a skin-crawlingly whimsical pre-credits montage shows us, so he sets out to get revenge on all the 'bad' people of the world. For a long time, he uses a simple pipe wrench, administering skull-cleavings that gradually ratchet up (har) as the action progresses. Before long, the film becomes incredibly brutal. The tone, not unlike Matthew Vaughn's recent and decidedly more mainstream Kick-Ass, is a consistently shifting entity, roaming from ferocious and dark to uplifting and righteously cheerful in a matter of seconds. It is, in retrospect, more akin to the bold bevy of splatter-flicks Peter Jackson churned out Pre-Lord of the Rings, particularly Dead Alive--to which some of the gore effects in Super seem to draw, though not to quite the same level of pandemonium.Violence is, without a doubt, at the core of Super, a far more dangerous and exploitative film than Kick-Ass, at least with regard to way in which the audience is meant to view the deranged protagonists. Wilson and Page have their hearts in somewhat of the right place, though their methods are absolutely extreme, in keeping, one imagines, with the lacking constraints of an ostensibly Comical universe. Limbs are blown apart, skulls are cracked, gooey gunshot wounds, an immolation, an exploding body and a smashed in skull rivaling the one administered by Ryan Gosling recently in Drive abound. For the most part, these effects are entirely practical, drawing up obvious influence from director Gunn's early work for infamous underground production company, TROMA--which groomed such auteurs as Zack Synder whose CGI-laden films have drawn large crowds of dense milling fanboys, particularly his recent technically-impression but greatly meandering Suckerpunch. Unlike Snyder, who is roaring into the mainstream and forgetting the elements of his Troma roots he carried into his phenomenal remake of Dawn of the Dead, Gunn has maintained with Super a commitment to making alienating, beautifully-shot and epically violent films whose moral centers are grounded in deep criminal delusion....and whose incredibly enthralling advances are incredibly difficult to deny. The film will likely force you to entertain it, then give itself some much needed relief when you find yourself loving every second it lavishes upon you...much in the same way as Ellen Page does on that fateful ride atop the queasy and resisting hero rising from darkness of his own creation.",5,Epic gore and a delusional heart makes this Gunn's best work to date,1322438400,"11 28, 2011",2011,3357,"['Teaming', 'up', 'once', 'more', '4', 'year', 'haitus', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'play', 'quite', 'different', 'couple', 'did', '2007', 'indie', 'teen', 'pregnancy-smash', 'Juno', 'relationship', 'time', 'around', 'more', 'inappropriate', 'Wilson', 'Crimson', 'Bolt', 'more', 'appropriately', 'self-loathing', 'alter-ego', 'Frank', 'might', 'put', 'movie', 'Page', 'control', 'Wilson', 'ways', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'printed', 'here', 'fear', 'ruining', 'surprises', 'probably', 'alienating', 'friendly', 'Amazon', 'readers', 'relationship', 'hapless', 'largely', 'unhinged', 'Frank', 'cute/absolutely', 'sociopathic', 'ruthlessly', 'salacious', 'sidekick', 'Boltie', 'only', 'one', 'specific', 'elements', 'James', 'Gunn', 'film', 'leave', 'lacerating', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'impression', 'days', 'after.The', 'film', 'principle', 'arc', 'simple', 'revenge/improvement-of-self', 'plot', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'fed', 'up', 'getting', 'peed', 'figuratively', 'literally', 'skin-crawlingly', 'whimsical', 'pre-credits', 'montage', 'out', 'get', 'revenge', ""'bad"", 'people', 'world', 'long', 'time', 'simple', 'pipe', 'wrench', 'administering', 'skull-cleavings', 'gradually', 'up', 'har', 'action', 'long', 'film', 'incredibly', 'brutal', 'tone', 'not', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'recent', 'decidedly', 'more', 'mainstream', 'Kick-Ass', 'consistently', 'shifting', 'entity', 'roaming', 'ferocious', 'dark', 'uplifting', 'righteously', 'cheerful', 'matter', 'seconds', 'retrospect', 'more', 'akin', 'bold', 'bevy', 'splatter-flicks', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'churned', 'out', 'Pre-Lord', 'Rings', 'particularly', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'gore', 'effects', 'Super', 'seem', 'draw', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'level', 'pandemonium.Violence', 'doubt', 'core', 'Super', 'far', 'more', 'dangerous', 'exploitative', 'film', 'Kick-Ass', 'least', 'regard', 'way', 'audience', 'meant', 'view', 'deranged', 'protagonists', 'Wilson', 'Page', 'have', 'hearts', 'somewhat', 'right', 'place', 'methods', 'are', 'absolutely', 'extreme', 'keeping', 'one', 'imagines', 'lacking', 'constraints', 'ostensibly', 'Comical', 'universe', 'Limbs', 'are', 'blown', 'apart', 'skulls', 'are', 'cracked', 'gooey', 'gunshot', 'wounds', 'immolation', 'exploding', 'body', 'smashed', 'skull', 'rivaling', 'one', 'administered', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'recently', 'Drive', 'abound', 'most', 'part', 'effects', 'are', 'entirely', 'practical', 'drawing', 'up', 'obvious', 'influence', 'director', 'Gunn', 'early', 'work', 'infamous', 'underground', 'production', 'company', 'TROMA', 'groomed', 'such', 'auteurs', 'Zack', 'Synder', 'CGI-laden', 'films', 'have', 'drawn', 'large', 'crowds', 'dense', 'milling', 'fanboys', 'particularly', 'recent', 'technically-impression', 'greatly', 'meandering', 'Suckerpunch', 'Snyder', 'who', 'roaring', 'mainstream', 'forgetting', 'elements', 'Troma', 'roots', 'carried', 'phenomenal', 'remake', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Gunn', 'maintained', 'Super', 'commitment', 'making', 'alienating', 'beautifully-shot', 'epically', 'violent', 'films', 'moral', 'centers', 'are', 'grounded', 'deep', 'criminal', 'delusion', '.and', 'incredibly', 'enthralling', 'advances', 'are', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'deny', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'force', 'entertain', 'then', 'give', 'much', 'needed', 'relief', 'when', 'find', 'loving', 'second', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'fateful', 'ride', 'queasy', 'resisting', 'hero', 'rising', 'darkness', 'own', 'creation']",N/A

In order to deal with it all he puts on a superhero costume, calls himself The Crimson Bolt and goes around beating on people with a wrench. He even designs some gadgets but most of them suck. He picks up a bored young girl sidekick who is socially awkward and borderline deranged as she laughs over dead people. In fact, the hero restrains the sidekick from offing people as they go along in the tale which is interesting to see in action. But the overall thrust is upon the hero exposing the badness of the drug lord and winning his wife back. There are some great moments in here and some of them are even better if you get the comic book superhero subculture but it isn't necessary to enjoy it. Ellen Page is brilliant as the nerdy, deranged sidekick and Rainn Wilson does a good job playing a socially awkward somewhat ""do the right thing"" type of superhero with narrow rules. People may be torn in sympathizing or despising the hero as he goes from depressed to violent maniac. In fact, this film does a very good job of tearing your emotions back and forth, especially in scenes that jump from sad to hilarious. In essence this is about a deluded man seeking self discovery who chooses to use a superhero costume to do it and explores the issues of what is a superhero as well as what are the boundaries of a superhero?

It came out about a year after ""Kick-Ass"", a similarly themed but much better film.  Rainn Wilson stars as Frank, a typical dweeb usually played by Wilson.  Frank is a short-order cook with a serious lack of social skills who lucks into a relationship with a hot waitress played by Liv Tyler.  Sarah (Tyler) and Frank get married but come on, Sarah has needs.  A recovering addict and stripper, Sarah reverts to her old ways, ultimately leaving Frank.  Frank is pissed.  He decides he must fight the crime that led Sarah to go astray.  The criminal element is taking over.  Drugs, sex, prostitution is rampant.  Not to mention people cutting in line at the movies.  That's a real no-no in Frank's book.  He dons a red costume, grabs a pipe wrench as a weapon and does his thing.  He's not very good at it, except for wielding the wrench.  The film just drags along for the first half.  He then acquires a partner.  The movie is energized when Ellen Page shows up as a clerk in a comic book store named Libby.  She's cute but like Frank is out to fight crime, including the guy who may have ""keyed"" a friend's car.  So now, the Crimson Bolt and Boltie go after the local mobster chieftain (played with relish by Kevin Bacon).  Things don't go well.

It's all about redemption and facing your fears, but I'm not sure how ending up with a pet rabbit really embodies all that. Additionally, the director liberally ""borrows"" scenes from other movies (or rather, he takes the basis for the scenes and alters them for his movie). The most obvious example of this is the Egg scene from this movie which is a blatant rip off of the Big Kahuna scene from Pulp Fiction. Still, the movie is very intense and is entertaining until you just get tired of the characters. Rainn Wilson makes a very good unlikely vigilante, although at times, you just want to slap him and send him back to his mommy. His P.o.C Ellen Page...well, she's a little hottie until she loses face towards the end. And of course, Liv Tyler is gorgeous, even if she really doesnt pull off the drugged out addict very well. Lots of flaws in this movie, so i give it 2 stars due to the intensity and raw emotional power of the flick (otherwise, it would have received one star). There are funny moments, there are ""Oh S%&^"" moments, there are ""that was messed up moments"", etc....quite the roller coaster.

Frank D'Arbo (Rainn Wilson) is essentially a below average human being, who turns himself into a superhero in order to fight crime. However, his methods are questionable to say the least and that is where the violence comes into play. Frank gets overly violent for petty crimes, but it is his moral belief that he is doing good. This is where the film shines because it is what makes Frank an interesting and complex character. You could say Super is a character study in a sense. You actually sympathize with Frank because you understand that he is somebody who has a very tough life and his fuse has blown. This added with lots of hilarious bits is what makes the film great.

The basic plot is that Frank D'Arbo (Riann Wilson) is a mild mannered short order chef at a greasy cafe. His wife is a recovering drug and alcohol addict Sarah (Liv Tyler). They met when she started waiting tables at his cafe. We join them as she introduces some new friends to Frank who are all into their narcotics and alcohol etc. She doesn't just fall off the wagon she takes a triple jump off of it and lands in a liquor mart! One of them is Jacques (Kevin Bacon)a self centred gun toting drug dealer who likes to hang out at a bar called `Bare Assets', I think semi clad ladies might wander about inside you know!Frank comes home one day and finds that she is gone, he asks the police to help, but they point out that she has not been kidnapped but has left him. So Frank gets inspired by a television evangelical Super Hero' The Holy Avenger' (Thanks Jesus!) to become a Super Hero. Not knowing where to begin he visits a comic book store where he meets Libby (a potty mouthed Ellen Page). Soon he discovers the hero inside and things start to roller coast as he becomes `The Crimson Bolt'!This is a genuinely funny film, with some painfully funny slapstick and lines that are so cheesy you just wish you had said it first. We have a rubbish car that is transformed into a Super Hero Mobil merely by changing its name to `The Bolt Mobile!' Sorry you have to put exclamation marks after anything to do with Super Heroes - it's the law! See I told you. We also have issues of addiction, love, some severely unfunny violence and a helluva lot of warmth, as well as some Super Hero Sex! (I am getting bored with the exclamation marks now).Written and Directed by James Gunn this is probably his best film yet, mind you he did do Scooby Doo so not a massive amount of competition. This then is for fans of comedy, Super Heroes and just decent well made films and it proves you do not need a massive budget. All the acting is brilliant and you do get the feeling that they all must have had a blast making this, so Mr Gunn ignore any of the detractors as I can't wait for your next one.
