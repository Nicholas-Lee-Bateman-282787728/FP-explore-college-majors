One thing that makes it so good is the interviews of a surprising number of people who were there and are still alive.  Freedom Riders, an ex southern governor, Kennedy administration staff, and media who filmed it.  Just an incredible story.  I thought I already knew civil rights history.  Not so!  Like any great documentary, it educates you and blows you away with things you never knew. This does that, and makes you feel like you're there, with the interviews.  Add to that the suspense of not knowing what happens, like a good movie.  When a documentary has you on edge of your seat, you know it&#8217;s a winner!  An important period in american history that we must never forget.

I definitely gained a greater appreciation for all the people who had to go through this period and have to endure daily torments of the &#34;N&#34; word multiple times a day. They are much stronger people for what they went through compared with the spoiled people of our current generation.I am from Generation Y born in 1983, and I am definitely more well rounded and respect the people who went through this period. I respect african americans, but don't like it when some try to play the victim card when things don't go their way in life.

I've reported from across the U.S. and often, over the years, have reported on the legacy of the civil rights era. With all that background in my own work, I was startled by details, insights, archival photos and fresh interviews collected in this gripping documentary.The filmmakers' painstaking care in matching archival images with narratives from people who personally recall the events is startling--right down to a desperately needed glass of water placed into the hands of a Freedom Rider gasping from the smoke in her burned-out bus. These are the details that underline the accuracy of this dramatic account of the Freedom Rides--and, accumulated across the two hours of this documentary, they allow our spirits to soar with these young heroes on the buses. This is not Hollywood hype. This is hard-edged journalism documenting their real-life story.You will be surprised as you watch this film. There are revelations here about the Kennedy brothers' ambivalence toward civil rights and about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s own attitude toward the young activists. The faces will stir you: Hateful faces in high-resolution images will shock you, but the calm determination of the young Freedom Riders themselves will move you in a hopeful way.There are oceans of video about the civil rights era.

1393746,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B004AR4VRW,Happy Reader,"[3, 4]","I saw ""Freedom Riders"" on PBS and it raised several emotions in me.  Awe, at what an excellent documentary it is. Shame, at the story it told. Tension, because though I had a general idea of ""what happened"" at the beginning of the civil rights movement, I didn't know this specific story.  Where and by who were the Freedom Riders going to be threatened next as they ventured further south?  It could only end badly when law enforcement is complicit in the one-sided violence.I didn't write a review for ""Freedom Riders"" when I saw it, but I'm compelled to do so now, because I just saw the movie, ""The Help"".  Both films take place in the early 1960's and my mind boggles at the fear, no, terror, on which Jim Crow was based.  Granted, ""The Help"" is fiction, but it tells a riviting, and from what I've read, true-to-life story.The Freedom Riders had one goal.  Riding buses where blacks and whites sat together on the same bus and where-ever they wanted, and also sat together at the bus stations. And when they got to a town, they tried to eat together at the same restaurants. As they got plenty of attention, it got so the bus was anticipated on arrival. People were lying in wait for them. They were beaten just getting off the bus, much less anything else. It was brutal, including a time when some locals actually tried to burn the riders alive in the bus.This is a wrenching documentary to watch, but full of such interesting facts that I highly recommend it. What these people went through, all volunteers, took courage that I really don't think I have.",5,"Wrenching documentary, excellently done",1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,1563,"['saw', 'Freedom', 'Riders', 'PBS', 'raised', 'several', 'emotions', 'Awe', 'what', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'Shame', 'story', 'told', 'Tension', 'had', 'general', 'idea', 'what', 'happened', 'beginning', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'specific', 'story', 'Where', 'who', 'were', 'Freedom', 'Riders', 'going', 'be', 'threatened', 'next', 'ventured', 'further', 'south', 'could', 'only', 'end', 'badly', 'when', 'law', 'enforcement', 'complicit', 'one-sided', 'violence.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'review', 'Freedom', 'Riders', 'when', 'saw', ""'m"", 'compelled', 'do', 'so', 'now', 'just', 'saw', 'movie', 'Help', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'early', '1960', 'mind', 'boggles', 'fear', 'terror', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'was', 'based', 'Granted', 'Help', 'fiction', 'riviting', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'true-to-life', 'story.The', 'Freedom', 'Riders', 'had', 'one', 'goal', 'Riding', 'buses', 'where', 'blacks', 'whites', 'sat', 'together', 'same', 'bus', 'where-ever', 'wanted', 'also', 'sat', 'together', 'bus', 'stations', 'when', 'got', 'town', 'tried', 'eat', 'together', 'same', 'restaurants', 'got', 'plenty', 'attention', 'got', 'so', 'bus', 'was', 'anticipated', 'arrival', 'People', 'were', 'lying', 'wait', 'were', 'beaten', 'just', 'getting', 'off', 'bus', 'much', 'less', 'anything', 'else', 'was', 'brutal', 'including', 'time', 'when', 'locals', 'actually', 'tried', 'burn', 'riders', 'alive', 'bus.This', 'wrenching', 'documentary', 'watch', 'full', 'such', 'interesting', 'facts', 'highly', 'recommend', 'What', 'people', 'went', 'volunteers', 'took', 'courage', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have']",American Experience: Freedom Riders

Pouliot,"[2, 2]","Over the years, I have heard much about the Freedom Riders - those courageous souls who rode buses in through the American South in 1961 to protest the racial segregation of bus facilities. But I knew little about the riders or the details of their struggle. This marvelous DVD, ""Freedom Riders,"" arrives to fill the gap. Using film from the period as well as recent interviews with people on both sides, the film tells the story of the young black and white men and women who faced down one of the most terrifying and brutal regimes of its day. The frightening mob violence in Montgomery, Alabama, where mobs beat riders with pipes and bats, is highlighted, as is the evening church service where 1500 blacks were imperiled by ugly white mobs throwing rocks and setting off tear gas. The film shows the Kennedys, especially Bobby, alternately discouraging the ride and pressuring the Alabama government to protect them. Interviews with those in power, including former Alabama governor John Patterson suggests that they still have little remorse for their actions 50 years after they occurred. The role of Martin Luther King, Jr., who preached in Montgomery but declined to join the riders, shows some of the complex emotions and strategies at play in that hot summer.""Freedom Riders"" fills an important historical gap, depicting how the courageous actions of a few hundred dedicated individuals, united by a strategy of non-violence and inspired by a desire for justice, rained hammer blows on the citadel of racism and segregation.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[12, 12]","If you missed this two-hour documentary that aired on PBS earlier this month as part of the American Experience series, I urge you to catch the DVD version now available. A copy also belongs in every public and school library as this superbly done film covers - and does NOT sugarcoat - this important event. (Be aware that the ""N"" word is not edited out from archival footage, so it might be advisable for parents to share the viewing of it with young children.)It's hard for me to believe that it was only 50 years ago this month that near-complete segregation still existed in the U.S. Though the Supreme Court decided in the Brown v. Board of Education case that integration was now the law, in much of the South buses and lunch counters were still ""separate"" for ""whites"" and ""coloreds"" . It was in the Spring of 1961 that CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) organized a volunteer group of both black and white individuals to ride together on two separate buses (one Greyhound; the other Trailways) from Washington, DC to New Orleans. The first half of this film concentrates on that ride, melding archival footage (some amazing film!) with new interviews with those involved - most in their 70s now. We hear from the ""Riders"" as well as onlookers like Janie Forsyth McKinney, who was only 12 years old when one of the buses was torched in front of her parents' store. With tears in her eyes, she describes how she tried to help the injured in any way possible.When the CORE ""ride"" was finally canceled (it was a no-win at that point), the task was taken over by the Nashville Student Movement, which is covered in the later part of the film.Even if you think you remember what occurred - by reading the newspapers - you will discover new facts by watching the film. The lack of interest in supporting the ""Riders"" and resolving civil rights issues in general by the Kennedy administration is one fact that may surprise you.It is wonderful that the producers and directors were able to interview so many of the individuals who were there while they are still alive and their memories clear.
