1013940,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000HEVZSK,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 8]","Start reading about ghosts or watching documentaries about ghosts, and it won't take long for the subject of Waverly Hills to pop up.  Most Haunted, Ghost Hunters, Scariest Places on Earth - they've all been here because this place never disappoints (unlike the Waverly Hills-inspired horror movieDeath Tunnel, which was filmed on location here).  And why doesn't it disappoint?  Probably because well over 60,000 people supposedly died there over the course of a relatively few years.  The immense five-story building was built as a hospital for those suffering from tuberculosis, a disease which was running rampant in that area of Kentucky during the 1920s and 1930s.  Doctors performed a number of experiments and developed several rather extreme treatments for this awful disease, but Waverly's primary purpose, one could argue, was to quarantine the sick and dying in one place, away from the healthy.  The ""death tunnel"" came to be used to transport the large numbers of corpses down the hill and out of the place where the eyes of other patients could not see them, but most people who entered those halls knew they would likely never leave there alive.In terms of ghostly phenomena, Waverly Hills basically has it all: full-body apparitions, audible ghostly communication, shadow people, intense electromagnetic frequency spikes, dramatic temperature changes, EMP voice recordings, ghostly smells, moving objects, orbs, ectoplasm, spirit photography, etc.  We get a good sampling of all that evidence in this documentary, although some of it - especially the photographs - are open to interpretation (i.e., I personally don't see a single thing in some of the photos).  We also get to hear from a wide range of eyewitnesses.  Waverly haunted tour guide Keith Age ushers viewers through the five haunted floors, making special note of the most active areas; ghost hunters and thrill seekers talk about their personal experiences there; Death Tunnel director Christopher Saint Booth and a few of the hotties in his dreadful film talk about experiences they had in the building during filming; Waverly security guards tell their stories; a nurse who worked there in the building's later years as a geriatric home (which was finally closed in 1981 after years of patient abuse) is interviewed; a couple of elderly sanatorium workers actually return to the place to help explain what went on there; and even two tuberculosis survivors of Waverly Hills get plenty of screen time.Unlike Death Tunnel, the horror movie filmed on location and based on the stories of Waverly Hills, this documentary is actually full of creepy goodness.  It's also educational, especially for those of us too young to have lived through anything even approaching an epidemic.  Tuberculosis was a terrible disease; with dozens of victims dying every day, you get a new understanding of the death tunnel.  It sounds rather morbid and uncaring to talk about all of these bodies being removed through this tunnel, but here you can begin to appreciate the fact that it was used out of respect for the living.  Either way, it's all kinds of spooky - but not as much as the stories of the children who seem to be the most active of the untold number of spirits still haunting the walls of this living monument to human misery.",5,A decidedly creepy look at the history of the infamous Waverly Hills Sanatorium,1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,3301,"['Start', 'reading', 'about', 'ghosts', 'watching', 'documentaries', 'ghosts', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'subject', 'Waverly', 'Hills', 'pop', 'up', 'Most', 'Haunted', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'Scariest', 'Places', 'Earth', ""'ve"", 'been', 'here', 'place', 'never', 'disappoints', 'Waverly', 'Hills-inspired', 'horror', 'movieDeath', 'Tunnel', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'here', 'why', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Probably', 'because', 'well', '60,000', 'people', 'supposedly', 'died', 'course', 'relatively', 'few', 'years', 'immense', 'five-story', 'building', 'was', 'built', 'hospital', 'suffering', 'tuberculosis', 'disease', 'was', 'running', 'rampant', 'area', 'Kentucky', '1920s', '1930s', 'Doctors', 'performed', 'number', 'experiments', 'developed', 'several', 'rather', 'extreme', 'treatments', 'awful', 'disease', 'Waverly', 'primary', 'purpose', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'was', 'quarantine', 'sick', 'dying', 'one', 'place', 'away', 'healthy', 'death', 'tunnel', 'came', 'be', 'used', 'transport', 'large', 'numbers', 'corpses', 'down', 'hill', 'place', 'where', 'eyes', 'other', 'patients', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'entered', 'halls', 'knew', 'would', 'likely', 'never', 'leave', 'alive.In', 'terms', 'ghostly', 'phenomena', 'Waverly', 'Hills', 'basically', 'full-body', 'apparitions', 'audible', 'ghostly', 'communication', 'shadow', 'people', 'intense', 'electromagnetic', 'frequency', 'spikes', 'dramatic', 'temperature', 'changes', 'EMP', 'voice', 'recordings', 'ghostly', 'moving', 'objects', 'orbs', 'ectoplasm', 'spirit', 'photography', 'etc', 'get', 'good', 'sampling', 'evidence', 'documentary', 'especially', 'photographs', 'are', 'open', 'interpretation', 'i.e.', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'single', 'thing', 'photos', 'also', 'get', 'hear', 'wide', 'range', 'eyewitnesses', 'Waverly', 'haunted', 'tour', 'guide', 'Keith', 'Age', 'viewers', 'five', 'haunted', 'floors', 'making', 'special', 'note', 'most', 'active', 'areas', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'thrill', 'seekers', 'talk', 'personal', 'experiences', 'there', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Saint', 'Booth', 'few', 'hotties', 'dreadful', 'film', 'talk', 'experiences', 'had', 'building', 'filming', 'Waverly', 'security', 'guards', 'tell', 'stories', 'nurse', 'who', 'worked', 'building', 'later', 'years', 'geriatric', 'home', 'was', 'finally', 'closed', '1981', 'years', 'patient', 'abuse', 'interviewed', 'couple', 'elderly', 'sanatorium', 'workers', 'actually', 'return', 'place', 'help', 'explain', 'went', 'even', 'two', 'tuberculosis', 'survivors', 'Waverly', 'Hills', 'get', 'plenty', 'screen', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'horror', 'movie', 'filmed', 'location', 'based', 'stories', 'Waverly', 'Hills', 'documentary', 'actually', 'full', 'creepy', 'goodness', 'also', 'educational', 'especially', 'too', 'young', 'have', 'lived', 'anything', 'even', 'approaching', 'epidemic', 'Tuberculosis', 'was', 'terrible', 'disease', 'dozens', 'victims', 'dying', 'day', 'get', 'new', 'understanding', 'death', 'tunnel', 'rather', 'morbid', 'uncaring', 'talk', 'bodies', 'being', 'removed', 'tunnel', 'here', 'can', 'begin', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'was', 'used', 'respect', 'living', 'way', 'kinds', 'spooky', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'stories', 'children', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'most', 'active', 'untold', 'number', 'spirits', 'still', 'haunting', 'walls', 'living', 'monument', 'human', 'misery']",Spooked The Ghosts Of Waverly Hills Sanatorium

1013944,A1E37DNGUC3GCI,B000HEVZSK,"Jason Mierek ""uniqueness is ubiquitous""","[28, 43]","This was, simply put, the worst documentary I've ever seen, and that it currently rates four stars on Amazon tells you more about the tastes of its reviewers than it does about the DVD itself. Forty-five minutes into the film, my wife got up and walked out of the room, saying ""I can't take one more of these quick cuts or weird sound effects. When is this supposed to get scary rather than annoying?"" If you want a documentary to scare you because it is authentically scary, then do yourself a favor and skip this one. Please. I should have taken the Netflix reviewers more seriously.Ostensibly, this documentary is about the ghosts of Waverly Hills Sanatorium, a hulking building from the 1920s that was first used as a TB hospital and then as a badly run geriatric home until it was closed in 1980. According to the filmmakers, around 63,000 people died in the building during its tenure as a sanatorium, and so there are ample opportunities for hauntings. Except for one problem---a quick search of the Internet reveals that there is no such death statistic; all I can find is the same sourceless figure repeated ad nauseum. Maybe a few hundred people died of TB in the place, at most, but 63,000 is simply unsupportable, particularly for a place with a capacity of around 400. (That number more likely refers to the total number of deaths in Kentucky!) Alas this sense of inflation characterizes much of the rest of the material in the film.Three of the main sources of information are the new owner, his wife, and his father, all of whom obviously have an agenda trying to trump up business for tours through the big, old, spooky building. The much-hyped ""death tunnel"" was just an access corridor that allowed for the sheltered (from the elements and from onlookers) transport of materiel and deceased patients. ""Actual ghost photos"" just reveal pixelated blurs and blobs of light (""orbs"") and the ""electronic voice phenomena"" are laughable bursts of noise and static with suggestive subtitles over screenshots of oscilloscopes. We are told in one of many PowerPoint slideshows which pass for section intros that the orbs seen in some photos ""contain the spirits of multiple people""---where did they get this ""fact"" from? (That the same PPT slides are filled with typos was, sadly, unsurprising.) As for research into the stories behind the stories, we are told definitively that the ghost of room 502 hung herself in 1926. Or was it 1932? Or did she throw herself from the roof? (So much for that research, eh?) And one would have thought that, with all the friggin' video cameras being toted around, at least one person would have captured some pretty unambiguous weirdness on film, if the place was as filled with ghosts as the narrators would have us believe. Alas, this was simply not the case. The directors, aka the Booth Brothers (two British douchebags in cowboy hats and bad facial hair), tried to make this dearth of raw material scarier through the overuse of quick cuts, unsettling camera angles, spooky sound effects, annoying screams, and footage from *Death Tunnel,* their unnecessary horror flick about a sorority initiation inside Waverly. For an audience weaned on *Saw III,* these manipulations probably establish *Spooked* as a masterpiece; for those of us over 25, it just makes it an annoying waste of time. Truly, the only scary thing about this DVD is that most folks have rated it over 1 star.",1,Worst. Documentary.

A person was talking about all the bodies that passed through the chute, and footage was shown. NOT footage of the chute in it's day, but footage of concentration camp victims! This was film recognizable to any, um, actual historian, and was shot by US soldiers when they liberated the camps in Germany. That's where they lost us.

That's how I came across this, I thought it was going to be a movie, but it's actually a documentary... however, don't believe for one second that any of the contents are based on anything that ever really happened.This ""spook-u-mentry"" interviews supposed people who tell their little ghost stories about a hospital that really does exist in Kentucky, that was built to help patients in the early 1900's who had TB. It stayed a hospital until about 1960, and then became a retirement home until about 1980 before it was shut down. Now, these people being interviewed are claiming that the events that happened in a movie that was shot there called ""Death Tunnel"", was based on actual paranormal facts... *COUGH*BULL*COUGH*[..censored..]In the movie, Death Tunnel, they try to claim that the abandoned hospital is now haunted, in particularly by a little girl with rubber balls, and shadows... so in this documentary they have people who claim they where security guards and what not, and claim they have seen the little girl and played a game of ball with her... oh and everyone on the Scooby Doo Mystery Tour, hosted by a fat guy who claims EMT readers actually work, claim they see Shadows... yeah, you probably will at night with a bit of talk of boogedy boogadas, especially with trees and moon light helping that generally have been known to cast moving shadows... whats that word to describe that situation? oh yeah... nature.But wait, there is still more... not only is there a ghost of a little girl who likes to play fetch, and these shadows you are guaranteed to always see on the tour and play laser tag with, you can also take unconvincing photos of your experience, and claim that dust scratches, lens flair and good old imagination is your major breakthrough to capturing a ghost on film. Sure, most people will look at it and say, ""well, hmmmm, these twigs of this tree COULD look a little like a face... however that cloud up their kinda has a shape like Elvis roping a bull""... oh, and try not to laugh too hard, but they also dedicate a section to not just ghosts on film, or creepy noises, but ORBS!!!... of coarse, what spooky documentary isn't complete without one? Whats even cooler, if you ask the ghosts nicely, they will come back to your very own home and pose for pictures in your own living room!!!... how nice of them, tho, i suppose, they don't have much else to do these days?Not one of the photos or images they show in this documentary taken from inside or around the hospital even looks like a ghost... it's just wild imagination, or use of photoshop... I swear, one of the attempts at an obvious photoshop job was a picture taken on the 5th floor of the hospital where a nurse was supposed to have hung herself (even tho there is no documentation of this ever happening) it looks like a ninja, or Daniel San and Mr Miagi doing their Thai Chi on the beach... the Lotus stance? something like that... kinda reminded me of a graphic from Mortal Kombat... and then, it had another picture for the head... well, at least ghosts have a sense of humor and are doing karate poses for the souvenir snapshots.The fat guy with the working EMP's states that the worst thing that has ever happened there, to him, was he had bits of concrete fly at his head... yeah, I don't blame ghosts for throwing things at you for making money out of lying about your BS experiences to financially gain something on an abandoned building with no known stories told about it until 1994 when the new owner thought to himself, ""Why did I buy this place? What use is it to me now? I think I will just claim it's suddenly become haunted for the first time in 70-80 years after it was built!"". Apart from bad nursing and care when it became a retirement home, which is why it got shut down, no one has ever told any stories of any wrong doing in that place, and no one had ever claimed it being haunted or seen these mysterious shadows that you can play laser tag with until the movie was made, and a fat guy is now making a small profit out of a ghost-hunt tour of the building.This entire thing is 100% pure bull doodoo, yeah i said doodoo cause Amazon tend to not allow my reviews to be published when I use realistic everyday vocabulary. Which is probably for the best, as most of my reviews would be much simpler if i was allowed to just write ""This movie was bleeping BLEEP house""... but such is life. So anyway... overall, as much as I can see through this scam that it is just one big ploy to try and either get people to see their movie ""Death Tunnel"" which flopped harder then if Bill was expecting Monica and in walked Hillary tongue wrestling with Rosie *shudder* (I claim copyright to that horror story btw) but at least they do kind of redeem themselves here... the acting is mostly pretty good, you can really tell that the thing wasn't so much written and rehearsed, as more like ideas where given to actors and told, ""Ok, throw some BLEEP at us, and lets see what sticks, 'cuz Papa lost all his money on that p.o.s (Death Tunnel) now we wanna make up our losses with this fake DVD Bonus feature, that we will be conveniently selling separability from the DVD, as to make sure someone see's the first ever fake documentary DVD bonus feature that is better then the actual DVD feature itself""Pros.- Great laughs (even if they are unintentional, especially the thing about midget ghosts popping out to greet people to Haunted Munchkin Land.- Acting is decent... especially that fat guy who is convinced his EMP meter can detect ghosts, and can explode too! Must have bought some dodgey equipment off of ebay... if i was him, I'd demand a refund.- The photographic evidence of faces seen in twigs and wall cracks, ohh and lights! Ya just can't convince a person of paranormal activity more then taking pics of lights, lens flair, rain drops, aerosol spray, sneezes, cigarette smoke and just good ole taking shots too close to a window... (go try this, it's fun)Cons.- Pure 100% B.S. In fact; it's so full of a B.S, it's like watching 100 pounds of B.S in a 50 pound bag being stuffed into a lunchbox!- It's watchable from start to finish.- Proves that with no money, and knowledge of photoshop, you too can redeem a terrible movie.- This band apparently is haunted by the ghost that they stole the room numbers off... (I snickered, but it was too stupid to really burst out laughing at)- They say no one else lives near by... oh yeah? Try telling that to the people who live near by and say NOTHING has ever happened there when they went for a visit to see some ghosts and came back with nothing but haunting memories that they gave this fat guy money to take them on a tour around the hospital and claim this nice old historical building is now in possession of Casper & friends.- No Ghostbusters :( (that's what killed it for me

Of course there was suffering had by the TB patients and some of them died and so did nursing home patients, but there's little evidence that the staff was all that horrific or abusive, which is what this doc consistently attempts to imply. Additionally, the actual photos of ghosts and the supposed EVP recordings of spirits were totally unconvincing.  Their interpretations of ghosts in the images are akin to laying back on the grass on a summer day and saying ""that cloud looks like a bunny rabbit"" and ""OMG this cloud looks like my dead uncle"".  As with most EVP recordings I've heard in my life, the voices are way too unintelligible and the people who recorded them just seem to be trying to fit what they want to hear with the tone and cadence of the recording, more than any objective, open-minded interpretation.While not worth buying, it's worth watching, but, repetitive and not entirely convincing on the grim picture they attempt to paint.",2,Meh,1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,1189,"['do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'Waverly', 'Hills', 'actual', 'spooky', 'place', 'hang', 'out', 'given', 'time', 'doc', 'poor', 'job', 'selling', 'idea', 'was', 'actually', 'place', 'torture', 'pain', 'horror', 'etc', 'functioning', 'institution', 'course', 'was', 'suffering', 'had', 'TB', 'patients', 'died', 'so', 'did', 'nursing', 'home', 'patients', 'little', 'evidence', 'staff', 'was', 'horrific', 'abusive', 'what', 'doc', 'consistently', 'imply', 'Additionally', 'actual', 'photos', 'ghosts', 'supposed', 'EVP', 'recordings', 'spirits', 'were', 'totally', 'unconvincing', 'interpretations', 'ghosts', 'images', 'are', 'akin', 'laying', 'back', 'grass', 'summer', 'day', 'saying', 'cloud', 'bunny', 'rabbit', 'OMG', 'cloud', 'dead', 'uncle', 'most', 'EVP', 'recordings', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'life', 'voices', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'unintelligible', 'people', 'who', 'recorded', 'just', 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'fit', 'what', 'want', 'hear', 'tone', 'cadence', 'recording', 'more', 'objective', 'open-minded', 'interpretation.While', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'worth', 'watching', 'repetitive', 'not', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'grim', 'picture', 'attempt', 'paint']",Spooked The Ghosts Of Waverly Hills Sanatorium
