I was expecting a light comedy but what I got was a whole lot more.Following a similar plot to the skit, Coneheads is the story about the Beldar Conehead family who crash on earth during a scouting mission for planet conquest. While here, they dodge the INS, have a child and discover that life on Earth is quite good.This is where the movie shows its heart. It could have been a movie of comedy bits but by the end, it is about happiness in a stable family, which is quite refreshing in these days of depressing movies about divorces and unmarried couples. It is nice to see Beldar be a father figure to his daughter rather than the &quot;Let Your Kids Be Who They Are&quot; mentality of these days. The direction of the film in excellent, setting up many nice visual gags and shots that are very impressive for a comedy film. And at times, the film feels &quot;epic&quot; as you see the family on the run from the INS, to moving to the suburbs to returning to their planet.There are great performances throughout the film and the many cameos are perfect. Look for funny scenes from Jan Hooks, Adam Sandler, Michael Richards, and Garrett Morris. Michelle Burke makes a nice debut as Connie Conehead and I expect to see more of her in the future.On the surface, this seems like a dumb movie and it has received many poor reviews.

Every time it just gives me a nice warm chuckle, yet presents a very good message for the wider movie go'er demographic. Featuring some of the biggest names in American comedy, including the legendary Dan Aykroyd as the main man of the movie, there was no doubting this would be comic gold.The story focuses around Beldar & Prymatt Conehead who are aliens from another world. Whilst on a scouting mission for planet conquest, they are inadvertently left behind. Whilst waiting to be rescued they decide to adapt to life on Earth and become illegal citizens of America. During that time they have a daughter, are constantly on the run from the INS and try to live a normal American sub-urban life.Going from the story you are forgiven for thinking that it just sounds like a stupid comedy movie, but the involvement of the great comedy minds are what make this movie work. The adaptation of the aliens into American suburbia is the obvious standout feature of the picture. Beldar (Aykroyd) and Prymatt (Curtin) present a relatively creepy persona of the Conehead aliens, yet what they actually do is present a very accurate idea of illegal immigrants trying to integrate into this suburban lifestyle.The film is very metaphorical in that respect, as the mixture of the Coneheads culture and ideas with that of Americans is in a sense ""Alien"" and represents that idea we have of immigrants moving to a strange land. Upon the birth of their daughter Connie (Burke) that American culture becomes even more Alien as their daughter is one of them, but not only that, she's a teenager.Throughout the film there are some genuinely classic moments that have me in tears every time, especially the time when Eldar becomes a cab driver and to hide his conehead he dons a turban.

Coneheads is arguably based on a funnier idea than either of the other two, but for some reason the film it produced was less successful.

The fact that the material has been stretched to thrice its original length shows slightly with some padding material.Ayckroyd and screen daughter Michelle Burke are fine in their roles, and quite endearing to watch. You might think differently, but for me, Jane Curtin doesn't quite have their charm, although it's interesting to see her develop some of the mannerisms she would later use in Third Rock From The Sun. 23 year old Michelle Burke and 29 year old Chris Farley play the two teenage lovers and Spinal Tap's Michael McKean plays the villain. Surprisingly this casting works. The youngsters appear younger than they are and McKean shows his range.There is some clever defamiliarisation satire on the American way of life, the English Language, and on immigration policies.

I have seen very little of the Coneheads on SNL itself, but this movie was rather funny and satisfying.Beldar and Prymaat are given a good backstory and a plausible reason (at least, for a sci-fi comedy movie) for being here on Earth and then getting stuck. Their attempts to integrate into Earthian society is also amusing - bumbling at first, but they quickly learn. As they learn, their circumstances improve (first, they're living in a junkyard in a trailer while Beldar works as a repairman next to said junkyard) before Immigration goes after them. Forced to relocate, they move to the basement of a house while Beldar becomes a taxicab driver. With the impending arrival of a baby, they find ways to again move up, and Beldar's experience as a cab driver enables him to open his own driving school while the family settles into a cute little two-story house.Of course, Immigration still goes after them, though after they disappear from their second home, the agents give up due to lack of interest and funding. Fast forward to appr. 15 years later, their child is now a teenager girl and the Coneheads have all but forgotten the rescue ship that was being sent for them, as they have settled into a life of domestic comfort.

The movie Coneheads don't continually freak out unsuspecting visitors or do anything of that sort, which is what they always did TV.  When the Coneheads first started out on TV, you'd see someone visit the Conehead house, get freaked out by the weirdness of it all, and (usually) run away.Oh sure, there are parts in the film where people get freaked out, but no one runs away, so the Coneheads actually start to blend in.  When that happens, the Coneheads just aren't as funny.
