The cast of characters is equally appealing and I will be recommending this series for as long as I have breath in me. Just buy the entire series and thank me later. Oh, and he drives a 1967 Alvis to and from his client meetings. Gorgeous colour photography (sorry - couldn't resist) throughout.CAA",5,Stephen Fry is utterly charming,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,430,"['Peter', 'Kingdom.He', 'compassionate', 'wise', 'sometimes', 'wise-ass', 'What', 'perfect', 'blend', 'character', 'traits', 'charming', 'Brit', 'cast', 'characters', 'equally', 'appealing', 'will', 'be', 'recommending', 'series', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'breath', 'Just', 'buy', 'entire', 'series', 'thank', 'later', 'Oh', '1967', 'Alvis', 'client', 'meetings', 'Gorgeous', 'colour', 'photography', 'sorry', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'throughout.CAA']",Kingdom Complete Series
