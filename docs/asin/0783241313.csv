The only reason why I watched it was because my older sister thought I wanted it when what I actually wanted was the one with Reese Witherspoon. It's now in my trash.,1,A Very Horrible Movie,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,301,"['Yes', 'why', 'What', 'was', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'thinking', 'very', 'stupid', 'movie', 'wish', 'never', 'watched', 'not', 'funny', 'so', 'boring', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'watched', 'was', 'older', 'sister', 'thought', 'wanted', 'when', 'what', 'actually', 'wanted', 'was', 'one', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'now', 'trash']",Man on the Moon VHS
70058,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,0783241313,A Forest Fan,"[0, 0]","I come at this from the angle of being a fan of wrestler Jerry ""the King"" Lawler, but I am a fan of Andy Kaufman after seeing this. Those who worked with the late 35-year old all teamed together to make and star in this movie. Jim Carrey falls into this role without being overly ""Ace Ventura"", if that is the right term. This movie came about after the success of REM's hit single ""Man on the Moon"", so it was fitting they assisted on the soundtrack.Kaufman died so young, it's affirming to see so many people that he affected show up to be in this film. The cast of Taxi is there. In a clever bit of casting, Danny Devito plays his manager, and is the only one off the set when they re-enact Taxi clips with the cast. Great to see Jeff Conaway (Babylon 5), Christopher Lloyd, Marilu Henner, Judd Hirsh, Carol Kane, and various Saturday Night Live personalities paying tribute to their friend.I'm making this sound really sappy, but the movie is edgy and funny despite my description. This one is almost safe for the whole family, save for one topless prostitute scene which is so harmless and silly that I'd put this at PG-13 age rating. (Kaufman's writer friend pays for a prostitute, but all he does is wrestle her like his wrestler persona.)For wrestling fans, Jerry Lawyer and WWE commentator Jim Ross do a fine portion. Their section (including the infamous David Letterman assault interview) is actually a larger chunk of the movie than I thought, funny stuff throughout.There is also someone named Tony Clifton, who outlives Kaufman in real life and never seems to go away. Those who watch the movie will get this, but keep an eye out for this character. Tremendous acting job (jobs?) by the actor who plays him...?For those reading the Amazon listing, a small correction: The listed ""Documentary: Andy: The Andy Kaufman Story"" is just a text right-arrow screen listing that you flip through. The Spotlight On is an 18 minute behind the scenes documentary which has some clips of Kaufman's girlfriend and the cast on filming the movie. This small documentary is a treat. There's also a music video section featuring REM, from the days when MTV actually ran music videos of quality.This might be remembered as Jim Carrey's lasting work, his tribute to the iconoclast Andy Kaufman.",5,Warm and Funny,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,2288,"['come', 'angle', 'being', 'fan', 'wrestler', 'Jerry', 'King', 'Lawler', 'am', 'fan', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'seeing', 'who', 'worked', 'late', '35-year', 'old', 'teamed', 'together', 'make', 'star', 'movie', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'role', 'being', 'overly', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'right', 'term', 'movie', 'came', 'about', 'success', 'REM', 'hit', 'single', 'Man', 'Moon', 'was', 'fitting', 'assisted', 'soundtrack.Kaufman', 'died', 'so', 'young', 'affirming', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'affected', 'show', 'up', 'be', 'film', 'cast', 'Taxi', 'there', 'clever', 'bit', 'casting', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'manager', 'only', 'one', 'set', 'when', 're-enact', 'Taxi', 'clips', 'cast', 'Great', 'see', 'Jeff', 'Conaway', 'Babylon', '5', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Marilu', 'Henner', 'Judd', 'Hirsh', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'various', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'personalities', 'paying', 'tribute', 'friend.I', ""'m"", 'making', 'sound', 'really', 'sappy', 'movie', 'edgy', 'funny', 'description', 'one', 'almost', 'safe', 'whole', 'family', 'save', 'one', 'topless', 'prostitute', 'scene', 'so', 'harmless', 'silly', ""'d"", 'put', 'PG-13', 'age', 'rating', 'Kaufman', 'writer', 'friend', 'prostitute', 'wrestle', 'wrestler', 'persona', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'Jerry', 'Lawyer', 'WWE', 'commentator', 'Jim', 'Ross', 'do', 'fine', 'portion', 'section', 'including', 'infamous', 'David', 'Letterman', 'interview', 'actually', 'larger', 'chunk', 'movie', 'thought', 'funny', 'stuff', 'also', 'someone', 'named', 'Tony', 'Clifton', 'who', 'Kaufman', 'real', 'life', 'never', 'go', 'away', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'character', 'Tremendous', 'acting', 'job', 'jobs', 'actor', 'who', 'reading', 'Amazon', 'listing', 'small', 'correction', 'listed', 'Documentary', 'Andy', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'Story', 'just', 'text', 'right-arrow', 'screen', 'listing', 'flip', 'Spotlight', '18', 'minute', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'clips', 'Kaufman', 'girlfriend', 'cast', 'filming', 'movie', 'small', 'documentary', 'treat', 'also', 'music', 'video', 'section', 'featuring', 'REM', 'days', 'when', 'MTV', 'actually', 'ran', 'music', 'videos', 'quality.This', 'might', 'be', 'remembered', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'lasting', 'work', 'tribute', 'iconoclast', 'Andy', 'Kaufman']",Man on the Moon VHS

70063,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783241313,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","The comedic sensation that was Andy Kaufman was the perfect showcase for the comedic sensation that is Jim Carrey.  The character was a perfect fit for Carrey, a role that really epitomized what makes him such an effective comic.The fact that he was snubbed the Oscar nomination for the likes of Sean Penn's muffled comedic timing in `Sweet and Lowdown' and Denzel Washington's mildly effective turn in `The Hurricane' is just rather insulting.Poor Jim Carrey; what does this man have to do to get an Oscar nomination?The film is a nicely constructed collection of Andy's more celebrated and remembered moments, capitalizing on his outlandish behavior and memorably televised tantrums.  From his early career, wasting away doing immature standup, to the crux of his fame where he was staring on a hit show, tossing insults towards women and staging outlandish fights on national television, `Man on the Moon' condenses it all in a slick format that never feels crammed; surprisingly.  It fictionalizes some of his life, for dramatic effect, but for the most part `Man on the Moon' doesn't have to work too hard coming up with ideas to fill a slot; Kaufman's life did all the work for them.  The inclusion of a `composite girlfriend', Lynne, was a smart move (compiling Kaufman's girlfriends into one character with lasting shelf-life and purposeful effect) and serves as one of the films's better decisions.  The prologue opens the film with the specific point that some of this `story' has been altered or shifted out of order in order to create a more cohesively impactful film.This decision paid off very nicely.Carrey is dynamic as Kaufman.  He seeps into the comedic nature of the man without ever becoming a mere gimmick.  You can feel the man's soul through Carrey's eyes.  It is a crowning achievement for Carrey; a performance that he will always be remembered for.  Paul Giamatti and Danny DeVito are also wonderfully used here, delivering sharply underplayed performances that never take away from the star but add to his presence.  The real `supporting' standout here is Courtney Love.  She is beautifully subtle here, which is not something she's known for.  She injects real heart into her portrayal of Lynne Margulies and her scene at dinner, where she collapses in tears...it's remarkably heartbreaking.Much like recent biopics (`American Splendor' and `Bronson' come to mind), this isn't a biopic to be taken for face value.  There is a true identity found here that relishes in its own ability to bend truth in a way that creates an ambiguity about the film.  The film almost comes across like a work of fiction, which brilliantly captures the essence of its subject.",5,Dancing on the moon...,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,2685,"['comedic', 'sensation', 'was', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'was', 'perfect', 'showcase', 'comedic', 'sensation', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'character', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Carrey', 'role', 'really', 'epitomized', 'what', 'such', 'effective', 'comic.The', 'fact', 'was', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'likes', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'muffled', 'comedic', 'timing', 'Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'mildly', 'effective', 'turn', 'Hurricane', 'just', 'rather', 'insulting.Poor', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'what', 'man', 'have', 'do', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'nicely', 'constructed', 'collection', 'Andy', 'more', 'celebrated', 'remembered', 'moments', 'capitalizing', 'outlandish', 'behavior', 'memorably', 'televised', 'tantrums', 'early', 'career', 'wasting', 'away', 'doing', 'immature', 'standup', 'crux', 'fame', 'where', 'was', 'staring', 'hit', 'show', 'tossing', 'insults', 'towards', 'women', 'staging', 'outlandish', 'fights', 'national', 'television', 'Man', 'Moon', 'condenses', 'slick', 'format', 'never', 'crammed', 'surprisingly', 'life', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'most', 'part', 'Man', 'Moon', ""n't"", 'have', 'work', 'too', 'hard', 'coming', 'up', 'ideas', 'fill', 'slot', 'Kaufman', 'life', 'did', 'work', 'inclusion', 'composite', 'girlfriend', 'Lynne', 'was', 'smart', 'move', 'compiling', 'Kaufman', 'girlfriends', 'one', 'character', 'lasting', 'shelf-life', 'purposeful', 'effect', 'one', 'films', 'better', 'decisions', 'prologue', 'film', 'specific', 'point', 'story', 'been', 'altered', 'shifted', 'order', 'order', 'create', 'more', 'cohesively', 'impactful', 'film.This', 'decision', 'paid', 'off', 'very', 'nicely.Carrey', 'dynamic', 'Kaufman', 'comedic', 'nature', 'man', 'ever', 'becoming', 'mere', 'gimmick', 'can', 'feel', 'man', 'soul', 'Carrey', 'eyes', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'Carrey', 'performance', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'are', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'used', 'here', 'delivering', 'sharply', 'underplayed', 'performances', 'never', 'take', 'away', 'star', 'add', 'presence', 'real', 'supporting', 'standout', 'here', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'beautifully', 'subtle', 'here', 'not', 'something', 'known', 'real', 'heart', 'portrayal', 'Lynne', 'Margulies', 'scene', 'dinner', 'where', 'tears', 'remarkably', 'heartbreaking.Much', 'recent', 'biopics', 'American', 'Splendor', 'Bronson', 'come', 'mind', ""n't"", 'biopic', 'be', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'true', 'identity', 'found', 'here', 'own', 'ability', 'bend', 'truth', 'way', 'ambiguity', 'film', 'film', 'almost', 'work', 'fiction', 'brilliantly', 'essence', 'subject']",Man on the Moon VHS

70066,ARA48345JZPZR,0783241313,Archmaker,"[1, 1]","How much or how little you like this movie will depend on how much or how little you liked Andy Kaufman.I loved Kaufman as Latka and his alter ego Vic Ferrari on Taxi (a role Andy apparently hated and disparaged).  I found his Saturday Night Live appearances superficial and only mildly amusing.  I found his wrestling initially cute but soon very tedious.  And overall, I became weary of being a participant (as audience) in his in-joke put-ons.But comedy is in the eye of the beholder, and many people think he was a &quot;genius&quot;.  I don't see it, and I didn't see it when he was alive.  Nothing in this movie convinced me otherwise.I am not a fan of nostalgic &quot;let's return to childhood&quot; humor which became popular in various forms,  especially among Boomers.  And the humor of &quot;discomfort&quot;,i.e., I will stand here doing nothing discernible or something obnoxious until the audience becomes &quot;uncomfortable&quot; and therefore show that performance is a joke and I &quot;know the joke&quot; and it's funny cause I know it and most people don't and if you get it you're really &quot;hip&quot;...well, I don't buy it.  But, each to his own, and some people loved this stuff.Andy had such contempt for his audience, and made his humor so insular and self-absorbed that he was apparently shocked when he was voted off Saturday Night Live by the audience and dismayed when no one took his illness seriously.  Even jaded &amp; hip audiences get tired of having you give them the finger.The movie is well made and Jim Carrey does a great job as Andy.  It shows Andy as a basically gentle person and tries hard to convince us of his genius.  It does show that the reaction to Andy was mixed, and he could be trying to his friends and family as well.I think the final show at Carnegie Hall will help you decide where you place Andy Kaufman in the pantheon of performers.  Supposedly, his dying wish-list for a wonderful last show, I found it juvenile and trite.

Pfleeger,"[1, 5]","Milos Forman's biopic Man on the Moon is an interesting film: as entertainment its pretty good as a biography of the late Andy Kaufman it seems to be a little lacking. The strange thing is that I don't quite know why I feel this way since I know little about the life of Kaufman.Jim Carrey does a good job of imitation in this film. Parts of the story come across as Jim Carrey imitating Kaufam imatating Carrey. Once again I'm not sure if this was an intended effect or strange coincidence. I do know if I wanted to see an impersonation Carrey is probably the best to do one of this character.The storyline generally follows Kaufman's life from his childhood to his death from lung cancer at age 35. Along the way  we see snippets of his career as a performance audience and as a comedian. Many of the major life events are here but they somehow seem flat. We get the years on the sitcom Taxi, the wrestling, the Lawler controversy but it all seems contrived.Kaufman's biggest draw was that he did not care what his audience thought of him as long as they were made to think. An annoyed audience was as good as a happy one. This fact is well brought out in the Tony Clifton material.The DVD has a few extras woth noting. There is a Spotlight on Location which relies heavily upon interviews with Danny Devito who acted as producer and star in the film. There are a few minor deleted scenes, a text biography of Kaufman with Easter eggs that give clips of performances and two music videos by REMAll in all not a bad viewing experience but certainly not the greatest or as good as it could have been.",3,If You Believe they Put a Man on the Moon,1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,1600,"['Milos', 'Forman', 'biopic', 'Man', 'Moon', 'interesting', 'film', 'entertainment', 'pretty', 'good', 'biography', 'late', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'be', 'little', 'lacking', 'strange', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'why', 'feel', 'way', 'know', 'little', 'life', 'Kaufman.Jim', 'Carrey', 'good', 'job', 'imitation', 'film', 'Parts', 'story', 'come', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'imitating', 'Kaufam', 'imatating', 'Carrey', 'Once', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'intended', 'effect', 'strange', 'coincidence', 'do', 'know', 'wanted', 'see', 'impersonation', 'Carrey', 'probably', 'best', 'do', 'one', 'character.The', 'storyline', 'generally', 'Kaufman', 'life', 'childhood', 'death', 'lung', 'cancer', 'age', '35', 'way', 'see', 'snippets', 'career', 'performance', 'audience', 'comedian', 'Many', 'major', 'life', 'events', 'are', 'here', 'somehow', 'seem', 'flat', 'get', 'years', 'sitcom', 'Taxi', 'wrestling', 'Lawler', 'controversy', 'contrived.Kaufman', 'biggest', 'draw', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'audience', 'thought', 'as', 'long', 'were', 'made', 'think', 'annoyed', 'audience', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'happy', 'one', 'fact', 'well', 'brought', 'out', 'Tony', 'Clifton', 'material.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'woth', 'noting', 'Spotlight', 'Location', 'heavily', 'upon', 'interviews', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'who', 'acted', 'producer', 'star', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'text', 'biography', 'Kaufman', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'give', 'clips', 'performances', 'two', 'music', 'videos', 'REMAll', 'not', 'bad', 'viewing', 'experience', 'certainly', 'not', 'greatest', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Man on the Moon VHS

So I finally rented it from Blockbuster. I was astounded. This has to be Jim Carrey's best work ever. He IS Andy  Kaufman in this movie. I was a fan of Andy Kaufman since I was just a young  teenager. I remember the first time I saw him on a day time talk show. He  was off-beat and hilarious. He and Danny DeVito made &quot;Taxi&quot;. This  movie captures the real Andy Kaufman, how he was misunderstood and not  appreciated by people like my poor husband.Warning: If you wear your  heart on your sleeve, you're going to cry. I cried the last 20 minutes of  the movie and for 45 minutes afterwards.My son, who is only 12, watched  the last half with me and he liked it too. He had never heard of Andy  Kaufman, but now he is interested in him, all due to this movie. My son is  an amateur comedian himself (since he was 2 years old) and an experienced  class clown--yes he gets in trouble for it but he gets laughs too.A  very fine tribute by Danny DeVito, both as an actor and as the film's  producer, to Andy Kaufman. I've never heard Courtney Love sing but she CAN  act. The people who didn't like this movie probably didn't like Andy when  he was alive.A &quot;must see&quot; for an Andy Kaufman fan.

70073,AP7MYGA4UEE67,0783241313,C. Butler,"[2, 2]","I loved this movie, and would have given it five stars if if weren't so difficult to find certain extras on the DVD.  The disc promises footage of the real-life Andy Kauffman, and it can only be found by clicking on  barely-noticable pictures of Kaufmann's face in the biography extra, which  is meant to be read from off of the screen. I was only able to find it by  virtue of a site which helps people find hidden extras on discs. I'm still  trying to find the theatrical trailer, which is also supposed to be on the  disc. Is this Universal's idea of trying to do something  which Kauffman  would have done (i.e., the deliberately poor television signal on his  special)?The movie, however, is great.  Sure, they went a little  overboard with some of the scenes just being recreations of Kauffman's  routines, and there wasn't enough detail into his personal life, but that  doesn't mean that this wasn't a great movie. It was basically supposed to  be the story of his (extremely unique) method of entertaining which,in  essence, was to provoke the audience, and how his routine led most people  to doubt his real-life cancer diagnosis at the end of his life. This film  is a great parallel with &quot;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&quot;. I don't think  that the film would have been effective if it had dwelled more upon his  life outside of his routine, as other biographical movies are so prone to  do.As far as I'm concerned Carrey should have at least been nominated  for an Oscar. The opening scene was a riot. It was almost as if he was  channeling Kauffman's spirit throughout the entire production. This was a  beautiful film, and it's a shame that so very few people have seen it.  Perhaps I'm biased-I think Kauffman was a genius. I think that even people  who disliked the real-life Kauffman would find as much virtue in this film  as I have.",4,Great Film/Extremely Hard To Find Extras On DVD,959904000,"06 2, 2000",2000,1851,"['loved', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'difficult', 'find', 'certain', 'extras', 'DVD', 'disc', 'footage', 'real-life', 'Andy', 'Kauffman', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'clicking', 'barely-noticable', 'pictures', 'Kaufmann', 'face', 'biography', 'extra', 'meant', 'be', 'read', 'screen', 'was', 'only', 'able', 'find', 'virtue', 'site', 'people', 'find', 'hidden', 'extras', 'discs', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'also', 'supposed', 'be', 'disc', 'Universal', 'idea', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'Kauffman', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'i.e.', 'deliberately', 'poor', 'television', 'signal', 'special', 'movie', 'however', 'great', 'Sure', 'went', 'little', 'overboard', 'scenes', 'just', 'being', 'recreations', 'Kauffman', 'routines', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'detail', 'personal', 'life', ""n't"", 'mean', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'basically', 'supposed', 'be', 'story', 'extremely', 'unique', 'method', 'entertaining', 'essence', 'was', 'provoke', 'audience', 'how', 'routine', 'led', 'most', 'people', 'doubt', 'real-life', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'end', 'life', 'film', 'great', 'parallel', 'quot', 'Boy', 'Who', 'Cried', 'Wolf', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'had', 'dwelled', 'more', 'life', 'routine', 'other', 'biographical', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'prone', 'do.As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Carrey', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', 'riot', 'was', 'almost', 'was', 'channeling', 'Kauffman', 'spirit', 'entire', 'production', 'was', 'beautiful', 'film', 'shame', 'so', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'biased-I', 'think', 'Kauffman', 'was', 'genius', 'think', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'disliked', 'real-life', 'Kauffman', 'would', 'find', 'much', 'virtue', 'film', 'have']",Man on the Moon VHS
70074,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0783241313,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Man on the Moon is Jim Carrey's homage to comedian/non-comedian Andy Kaufman. A complex man, Kaufman didn't think of himself as a comedian, but he pioneered a bizarre act--as much conceptual art as comedy--oftentimes trying to provoke as much as get laughs. As his manager asked him:George Shapiro: Andy, you have to look inside and ask this question: who are you trying to entertain--the audience or yourself?In the movie George Shapiro is played by Danny Devito, but the real George Shapiro plays Mr. Besserman, who is forced to fire Andy from his comedy club because he isn't funny. He suggests a joke, like: ""Why did the Siamese twins move to England? So the other one could drive,"" but Andy doesn't get it, isn't interested.But Andy creates a character--foreign man--who does get a good reaction from the audience. He begins as a nervous, inept comedian, does a lousy impression of President Carter, and then says he will now do ""the Elvis Presley."" He rips off velcro strips on his pants, revealing the studs and sequins of ""The King's"" Las Vegas bell-bottomed jump suit. To a boom box rendition of ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" he dons the costume and transforms. His lip curls. He does a great ""Don't Step on My Blue Suede Shoes,"" then returns to character and nervously thanks the audience. Shapiro ends up managing him, though he is uncertain just where to book him. His break comes when he is cast as Latka Gravas for the sit com Taxi.Andy is loath to do a sit com, but dictates his terms, one of which is that Tony Clifton must appear in 4 episodes. Clifton turns out to be either the worst Vegas lounge act of all time, or an alter ego of Andy Kaufman, in either case, he is thrown off the set of Taxi, along with his entourage of hookers, after inciting a riot, complete with fisticuffs.The movie hits all the high and low points of Kaufman's career: Taxi, Tony Clifton, The Mighty Mouse theme lip synch on SNL, the ""fight"" on Friday's, The Great Gatsby bit, The intergender wrestling, the ""fight"" on Letterman, touch my cyst, his interest in Transcendental Meditation, his Carnegie Hall performance, complete with The Rockettes, Santa Claus, and an invitation for the entire audience to have milk and cookies, and finally his death from cancer. Or was that just another prank?Jim Carrey gave a pretty good performance, but overdoes it with the crazy eyes. Kaufman's crazy eyes were just a bit more unsettling. Carrey doesn't have as good a rhythm on the bongos as Kaufman--though his comic timing is impeccable. Jim Carrey has made an entertaining movie, and also let the audience in on the joke, if it was one of Andy's pranks--but that is also the problem. How do you make a movie about a comedian/non-comedian who stretched the whole concept of comedy to include jokes at the expense of his audience? He wasn't always even trying to make the audience laugh. Maybe the joke was just something he and perhaps one or two others could appreciate.Unlike this movie, whose aim is clearly to entertain. Was it then a failure because it strayed from the path pioneered by Kaufman? And what of Andy Kaufman. Was he serious, or was he putting you on? Even as he was dying of cancer, members of his own family think it may be just another prank. To this day there are people who think he faked his own death and will come back to laugh at our gullibility.The People vs. Larry Flynt: Also directed by Milos Forman, and also featuring Courtney Love.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest: Also directed by Milos, and featuring Danny Devito.Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas (Deluxe Edition): Great Jim Carrey performance in title role.The Cable Guy (Full Screen): Great and creepy Jim Carrey performance in title role.L.A.

While I totally loved him on the hit FOX T.V. show, IN LIVING COLOR, I felt that Jim Carrey's 15 minutes of fame was at the 14:53 mark and closing. He seemed like a one trick pony at the circus who could only do just one cool stunt. I dunno. It felt like Jim Carrey's brand of comedy was getting a little long in the tooth for me and getting old very fast. I thought that he had ruin out of juice and couldn't surprise me anymore.However, all that changed when I finally decided to take a chance on this movie, and I got to see a loving, if albeit glimmering, look at the life of one of the most beloved and insanely talented comedic performers of our recent times: Mr. Andy Kaufman!One could say that Kaufman was not a traditional comedian. He was more like a brilliant performance artist's artist. The performance was all and every thing. Whether you laughed or not didn't matter. For Kaufman, It was all about the messing with your mind and disturbing your mind's curiosity on so many levels but having you on the performance &#34;hook&#34; until the bitter end! In this vein, I think that's what's makes MAN ON THE MOON so captivating: It's a look behind Kaufman's curtain, a peak into the cupboard of his creativity, and a glimmer of what is and what isn't fun/funny or sarcastic/taboo from a man feeding off the reaction to it all...kind of like a school of sharks on the side of large a tuna boat jockeying for blood red fish scraps on the water.

And ""strange"" doesn't really seem to adequately describe real-life comedian Andy Kauffman. He was REALLY different, many times very offensive, sometimes very unfunny....but always extremely interesting and certainly unique.Jim Carrey shows us once again how comedians can be such good dramatic actors. Carrey is outstanding in this role, and perfect for it. The rest of the cast is good, too, from Danny DeVito to Paul Giamatti to Courtney Love.Right from the beginning of this movie one sees how original it is, and how original Kaufman was as a comedian. His routines, antics and put-ons are so realistically done that no thinks they are just that. Unfortunately, his ""jokes"" don't always go over so well, aren't appreciated by most audiences and he is not always the most likable entertainer you will ever see. That means - be forewarned - that there are a number of unpleasant scenes in this film. You have to really appreciate Kauffman's absurd humor and to appreciate Carrey's great portrait of this man.On multiple viewings (I've seen it four times) I liked this film even more than the first time, even though I knew the surprises. I don't know of any comedian - to this day - who deliberately tried to annoy his audience or truly liked it when his audience hated him. I cannot believe he had the nerve to do the things he did.

And then the heckler days &quot;yOU'RE NOT FUNNY, kAUFMAN.  tHE TRUTH IS, YOU PAID ME TO DO THIS...Am I right?  Am I right Kaufman, didn't you pay me...to heckle you?  So you would look good, huh?&quot;  And this bit goes on for an uncomfortable amount of time.  Kaufman seemed to be about layers of uncomfortability...about making the audience feel something other than laughs..Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski are fun screenwriters, (though I am not sure they are still working) having produced script for Larry Flynt and Ed Wood....they are not always concerned with tradition, and find great hools in telling the story.  They then seem like the perfect choice for writing the story of Andy Kaufman, the most non traditional of performers...and certainly the first five minutes of the film does not dissapoint...Kaufman(Jim Carrey) stands in a movie screen, tells everybody it is his movie and the weirdness ensues.Ok.Well, then the next two hours never captures this same kind of &quot;what is real?&quot; feeling.  I mean, don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed this movie, and Carrey does an amazing job of recreating Kaufman onstage...but I thought there were a few problems...one is that no one knew Kaufman that well, and therefore it is almost impossible to create a bio pic for someone you can't actually identify with.  Therefore we are saddled with forties bio cliches&quot;  I Want to Be The greatest of all times&quot; and the fantastic&quot;I want To Play Carnegie Hall&quot;, and the obligatory &quot;guy finds cyst on his neck&quot;.Second of All, Kaufman just comes off like a jerk half the time.Third of All, when the film ends, we are no further along about Kaufman than When the film started.But as I think about it, here an hour and a half after seeing the movie, I wonder if the wanting more, the frustration, the unanswered questions is not the ultimate Kaufman prank.  And the pranks are the major gist of the film.  Much of the film is about an audience not knowing how to take it all...and they are brilliant pranks...just when you think you have it figured out, Kaufman's illusionary reality takes over.So have we been had?  Is this film pretending to be a meaningful bio, and is the ultimate prank?

70089,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,0783241313,drkhimxz,"[0, 0]","Aside from a number of episodes of the sitcom Taxi, I never saw Andy Kaufman perform. I remember nothing of those episodes aside from the voice of his character. My guess is that now, nearly 30 years after his death at age 35, he is all but forgotten save for a small, now-middle aged audience and some younger viewers of Taxi reruns. In a few more years, no doubt, he will be remembered pretty much as well as is Joe Penner (1904-1941) another popular Jewish comic who died young (although Penner's popularity had a much broader base, having had a hit radio show and a number of films under his belt). The foregoing is not intended to diminish the degree of Kaufman's talent or popularity; I mean only to suggest that there is little in his career which will provide the base for an audience this year or years to come as re-runs of Taxi disappear from the screen. That fact, in turn, means to me that I should review only the film and not the film in relationship to the man who is the subject of the film. My summary judgment is that your enjoyment of the film rests on how Jim Carrey comes through to you (he is an enormously more successful performer than was the character he played). How well he represents Kaufman is a question, as I have pointed out,I cannot answer. Are the unfunny performances as unfunny as they were when Kaufman played the role? I don't know. I think he does a good enough job to sustain interest throughout. Danny DeVito gives excellent support, a number of the other players also contribute to providing a sense of reality. Over-all, I believe there is too little framework for understanding the main character; he did not arise, full-blown, as a unique entity, he reflected influences, a time and a place. Little of that appears; therefore, understanding why he was successful (the movie character not the real Kaufman) is more difficult than it should have been. Even the fictional 'Jolson Story' sought to provide social context for their character.Bottom line for me. If you know nothing at all about Andy Kaufman (who never lived to be a Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy, or others of his comic cohort) this should be an interesting and entertaining film; if you are quite familiar with his work, I do not know how you will feel.",4,Interesting biopic About a nearly forgotten funny-man,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,2276,"['Aside', 'number', 'episodes', 'sitcom', 'Taxi', 'never', 'saw', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'perform', 'remember', 'nothing', 'episodes', 'aside', 'voice', 'character', 'guess', 'now', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'death', 'age', '35', 'forgotten', 'save', 'small', 'now-middle', 'aged', 'audience', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Taxi', 'reruns', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'pretty', 'much', 'as', 'well', 'Joe', 'Penner', '1904-1941', 'popular', 'Jewish', 'comic', 'who', 'died', 'young', 'Penner', 'popularity', 'had', 'much', 'broader', 'base', 'having', 'had', 'hit', 'radio', 'show', 'number', 'films', 'belt', 'foregoing', 'not', 'intended', 'diminish', 'degree', 'Kaufman', 'talent', 'popularity', 'mean', 'only', 'suggest', 'little', 'career', 'will', 'provide', 'base', 'audience', 'year', 'years', 'come', 're-runs', 'Taxi', 'disappear', 'screen', 'fact', 'turn', 'should', 'review', 'only', 'film', 'not', 'film', 'relationship', 'man', 'who', 'subject', 'film', 'summary', 'judgment', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'rests', 'how', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'enormously', 'more', 'successful', 'performer', 'was', 'character', 'played', 'How', 'well', 'Kaufman', 'question', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'can', 'not', 'answer', 'Are', 'unfunny', 'performances', 'as', 'unfunny', 'were', 'when', 'Kaufman', 'played', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'think', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'sustain', 'interest', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'excellent', 'support', 'number', 'other', 'players', 'also', 'contribute', 'providing', 'sense', 'reality', 'Over-all', 'believe', 'too', 'little', 'framework', 'understanding', 'main', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'arise', 'full-blown', 'unique', 'entity', 'reflected', 'influences', 'time', 'place', 'Little', 'therefore', 'understanding', 'why', 'was', 'successful', 'movie', 'character', 'not', 'real', 'Kaufman', 'more', 'difficult', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Even', 'fictional', ""'Jolson"", 'Story', 'sought', 'provide', 'social', 'context', 'character.Bottom', 'line', 'know', 'nothing', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'who', 'never', 'lived', 'be', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'others', 'comic', 'cohort', 'should', 'be', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'familiar', 'work', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'feel']",Man on the Moon VHS

Some people question how much of a stretch this was for Carrey.  Personally I think this stretched his acting abilities extensively. Or, perhaps, all Carrey's outrageous comedic roles stretched his acting muscle and this rather sad story was really closer to who he really is. I don't know the man, so I cannot claim to know.

I forgot""Many people loved him.. but many didn't. Kaufman was an enigma. His jokes border on the extreme and played with the audience feelings and perception. It wasn't about mindless entertainment but to ignite  reactions regardless if these were positive or negative.If you haven't seen the movie maybe you should stop reading here since I might spoil surprises for you..The movie starts with a black-n-white intro by Kaufman (played by Carrey) explaining how the movie is stupid and asks the viewers to leave, then the credits start to roll. Its random and it goes for almost 4 minutes, and you really don't know what to make of. Then he goes to say ok that was just to get rid of the people who wouldn't understand me or won't even try so lets start the movie. That was brilliant because first it works as a practical joke, second it introduces us to the unpredictability of the character/film and third it does move the unbelievers out.Although the film follows Andy's life chronologically from his formative years at home to his rise and fall of stardom; the emphasis is really on his approach to humor. And the reason is simple Andy behind the curtain wasn't always too different from the man in act.Was he a genius trying to create the ultimate illusion or was he just plain crazy to do that type of stuff. And the answer is really neither and both. Because somewhere in between the Foreign man, Tony Clifton and the chauvinist wrestler lays the real man. There was a constant struggle to balance his personal ambitions and his willingness to entertain others.I gotta say Jim Carrey portrays all this perfectly. And I would go as far to say that he was born to play this role. I always hear people say Carrey's shiniest moment is ""The Truman Show"" and it gets me mad because I always think of""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" but hey I guess we were both wrong  it was neither, it was ""Man on the Moon"" where he went where no man had gone before...Anyways all this is something you might already know but it wasn't until the end when Andy is seeking miraculous medical treatment in the Philippines and he sees how they hide something to make it appear as extracted infected organs that he gets it, the scam is now being pull on him. He wasn't the only one creating illusions just the most crazy one.Life is a joke and cruel one at that. An illusion of an unfulfilled dream.

Carrey portrays Kaufman with such spooky accuracy that one has to wonder whether this was  an impersonation or a possession.  Kaufman could not have played Kaufman  any better.Andy Kaufman was an audacious pioneer in the world of shock  comedy.  His most popular work in `Taxi' was not his most important and was  the work he liked the least.  Kaufman was a ruthless manipulator of human  emotion.  He didn't care whether people loved him or hated him, laughed or  cursed him as long as they were reacting.  He would go to any lengths, no  matter how ridiculous or distasteful to shock his audience and put one over  on them.  Though not the first in this regard (Don Rickles and Don Imus  were offending people's sensibilities long before Kaufman emerged) his  antics raised the bar for shock comedy, aiding people like of Howard Stern,  Sam Kinison and Andrew Dice Clay.  Though I don't personally believe this  is a particularly constructive direction, I must concede that Kaufman broke  through some major barriers.The film's biggest shortcoming is its  neglect of the inner Kaufman.  Some of the best scenes explaining Kaufman's  motivations and reactions to his own behavior ended up in the deleted  scenes bonus feature on the DVD.  This relegated the film to becoming an  Andy Kaufman greatest hits film without Andy.  While it was entertaining as  such, the burning question remains unanswered, namely, ""What is this guy  thinking as he behaves this way?""I can't say enough about Jim Carrey's  performance.  He totally immersed himself in the character down to the most  meticulous detail.  As he explained in the featurette, he didn't just try  to impersonate Kaufman, he was intent on becoming him 24 hours a day.  People who knew Kaufman well, like Danny DeVito and Kaufman's girlfriend  Lynne Margulies, said that it was like Andy had taken over Carrey's body.  With each film he makes I gain a new appreciation for Carrey's skills as a  comedian and actor.  Though much of his early work was tripe, his range of  abilities continues to expand with each new role.  In many ways he reminds  me of Jerry Lewis, a brilliant mind behind the face of the village  idiot.I rated this film an 8/10.  It is a must see for Andy Kaufman fans  and will still be entertaining for those who missed Kaufman's work.

70097,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,0783241313,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","MAN ON THE MOONI have always been a huge fan of Andy Kaufman and in fact should have reviewed this all the way back when this first came out. I remember going to theaters opening night and loving this film from beginning to end. Particularly the way the film opened but alas I did not and finally felt the need to do so. This film is truly one of my favorites combining Andy Kaufman and Jim Carrey together in a role that seemed like only Carrey could really play. I always have loved the Golden Globes for awarding Carrey the best lead actor award, and have never truly felt the same about the Oscars for not even giving him a nomination. Still this is truly a special film about a special person.For those who do not know Andy Kaufman was never a comedian as much as he was an entertainer or performer, he says so himself in the film. But the man was a genius on a completely different level from the average person. The stuff you see in this film actually did happen; believe it or not he really did do these things. Everything from wrestling women and Jerry ""The King"" Lawler, to reading a book on stage to punish his audience, all the way to a huge night performing that lead to milk and cookies for the audience. The man truly was ahead of his time, and whether you loved him or hated him no one can say he was not memorable. I mean who else lead a different life as another character they created like Tony Clifton.As for the film this is one of the better biopics out there and not just because of who it is about, but also because they stuck to his style. I remember in the theaters the opening of the film was so extremely Kaufman's style and actually had people thinking they came in late and the film was over. No person ever other than Andy would want to annoy and trick his audience like that, but like I said you would remember him. Still keeping with that style the film never truly gives you a clear cut answer on his death and leaves you really wondering about a possible faking of it. Director Milos Forman and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski did a great job in portraying Andy as the madman he was, never going too far into his personal life and leaning more so to his crazy antics and style [the way Andy would have wanted this film done I believe].Jim Carrey gives his best performance ever as Kaufman from the voice to mannerisms and everything else Andy is brought to life once more. There was never a moment in this film that I felt I was watching Carrey, it truly felt like Andy up on that screen. His dead on impersonation of the Elvis character in Andy's style and Carrey as Andy playing Latka or of course everybody's favorite Tony Clifton. Paul Giamatti is brilliant playing Kaufman's best friend and co writer Bob Zmuda [who is really in the film as Jack Burns and is also an Executive Producer], another perfect casting choice for the film. Paul has always been one of my favorite actors and shines in this film as always. Danny DeVito who really did know Andy from their days on Taxi together plays Andy's agent and friend George Shapiro [who is also really in the film as Mr. Besserman and also an Executive Producer]. DeVito who also was a Producer on the film seemed like he truly enjoyed working on this film.For those who did not notice Norm Macdonald and The King of Queens Patton Oswalt are in this film briefly as is the WWE's Jim Ross as the wrestling announcer, but that leads me into one of my favorite things about this film, Jerry Lawler. The whole pro wrestling part of Andy's life is excellent and the fact that Lawler was a part of that is excellent. Courtney Love is good in this as well as Andy's love and I actually doubted her when this first came out but she did a good job. In fact everyone in this film did a great job from the smallest part to the largest; top to bottom it was good.This film is about a talented and revolutionary man in the entertainment business who played by his rules and had a lot of fun along the way. Sure he did do some mainstream stuff like Saturday Night Live, and Taxi but you have to remember the character he played on Taxi was a character he created as a nobody, who else has done that. The DVD is full of information on him and does indeed have real footage of the actual Andy, you can find them kinda hidden in the bio part of the special features in you move up to the faces of Andy I believe. There are behind the scenes and some excellent music videos by R.E.M. called ""The Great Beyond"" which was made just for this film and of course the classic amongst classics ""Man on the Moon"". Both are excellent songs with great videos, and like the movie itself are both dedicated to the one, the only, the always memorable Andy Kaufman.",5,CARREY'S BEST PERFORMANCE ABOUT A TRUE

I thought it was a very interesting concept, a film about an unconventional comedian who liked to provoke not just laughter from his audience, but confusion, anger and relief. It wasn't until halfway through that someone told me that it was based on a true story. ""You mean, someone actually did all this?"" I said, impressed. Kaufman must have been quite a character in real life, a character in more ways than one!Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufman, and I think he does a pretty good job potraying Kaufman from his low-key beginnings in the comedy clubs, through his days in ""Taxi"" all the way to the Carnegie Hall concert just before his death. He plays him as a passionate, curious man with a vision, a man who likes to have things his own way, and has a few ways of getting it. He's a man who seemed spontaneous but seemed to plan things both on stage and in life very carefully.There are a few special features on this DVD, and they're pretty interesting. There's a selection of deleted scenes, a featurette on the real Andy Kaufman, the original theatrical trailer, and two music videos from REM, who contributed to much of the soundtrack.Overall, worth a look for fans of biopics.",5,Man On The Moon,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,1296,"['Andy', 'Kaufman', ""n't"", 'as', 'famous', 'Australia', 'America', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Man', 'Moon', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'concept', 'film', 'unconventional', 'comedian', 'who', 'liked', 'provoke', 'not', 'just', 'laughter', 'audience', 'confusion', 'anger', 'relief', 'was', ""n't"", 'halfway', 'someone', 'told', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'mean', 'someone', 'actually', 'did', 'said', 'impressed', 'Kaufman', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'character', 'real', 'life', 'character', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'potraying', 'Kaufman', 'low-key', 'beginnings', 'comedy', 'clubs', 'days', 'Taxi', 'way', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'concert', 'just', 'death', 'passionate', 'curious', 'man', 'vision', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'things', 'own', 'way', 'few', 'ways', 'getting', 'man', 'who', 'seemed', 'spontaneous', 'seemed', 'plan', 'things', 'stage', 'life', 'very', 'carefully.There', 'are', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'interesting', 'selection', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'real', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'two', 'music', 'videos', 'REM', 'who', 'contributed', 'much', 'soundtrack.Overall', 'look', 'fans', 'biopics']",Man on the Moon VHS

There doesn't  seem to be an overall point to his life, other than to ammuse.  Likewise  for the movie.  For what it is, it is good.  But there are other biopics  that are much more interesting.  More because of the subjects than the film  making.On the plus side, Jim Carrey gives a wonderful performance.  I  thought he was robbed incredibly by the Oscars for not even getting a  nomination.

But I was not suprised  that Jim Carrey was chosen as the lead.  He captures Kaufman in a way only  Carrey could.  Kaufman had so many different characteristics (most of which  can be seen in the film) and Carrey tackles them like they are nothing.  He  is quite a brilliant actor even when dealing with his more comic films but  to watch him in a more dramatic role such as this really helps people take  him seriously.  The movie itself is kind of weak.  It's not bad but I found  myself expecting more of a biography. What you get in &quot;Man on the  Moon&quot; is a timeline.  His &quot;SNL&quot; appearance,  &quot;Taxi&quot;, Tony Clifton, wrestling, talk show antics, and more.  In  the end it basically looks like a bunch of Kaufman scetches being redone  with Carrey as if it were a Best of Andy Kaufman video with about a half  hour of biography in between.  I found the film to be very enjoyable in the  long run.  Carrey really shines in this film.  I had a good time watching  it I was just hoping for more of a biography and not just a rehash of old  bits.

Nevertheless, the movie STILL held my attention all the way  through, and I feel that Jim Carrey put on a stellar preformance in his  portrayal of the late entertainer!  So who was the &quot;real&quot; Andy  Kaufman?  Was he brilliant?  Crazy?  Misunderstood?  Or just plain weird?  Even after watching the movie, he remains an enigma - which is probably  EXACTLY as he would have wanted it!  Kauffman was unique; I guess there is  no denying that.  The movie is a bit disturbing, what with Kauffman's  losing battle of cancer at the end.  But then again, that's what really  happened, and even if you didn't follow Kauffman's carreer, the ending will  still touch your psyche.

I couldnt believe this kind of humor was unleashed at an unsuspecting audience watching this film. Jim Carrey is the most underrated actor in the world and No, I didnt like Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind because it is the opposite of what Man On The Moon is all for.You see, Eternal Sunshine just might be the most conscious semi dark heartful effort ever. All in all, it's consciousness is what makes it ""everything that is wrong with our world"". Man On The Moon is not for one second taking itself too seriously.I've always been a fan of Carrey but it is Man On The Moon that made me realise that there is no higher level of acting than this. THIS IS EASILY HIS BEST PERFORMANCE.Man On The Moon has the most extraordinary of beginnings and the story relation is different yet captivating and it doesn't make you wanna be anywhere else for one second. Based on the life of Andy Kaufman, this film manages to recreate the life of an extraordinary man. Many people felt Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman. The level and kind of humor this film contains is not meant to be understood by an average movie go'er. Between the 41st minute and 91st minute the film goes into an enjoyable dull period where most actions by Andy have no explanation.I hate Bongo drums but I cannot believe anyone can possibly sound better on them than Andy in the film. The reason the casting of this film is perfect is because Jim Carrey has one big heart for a comedian. Andy's funeral was the most touching scene in the film and almost a tearjerker.Im trying really hard to explain what it was about this film that touched my heart but I cannot quite get there because my comprehension fails me.

Jim Carrey  gives the performance of his career as Andy Kaufman, the ex-""Taxi"" star  who's life was cut short by cancer. Whether you loved Kaufman or hated him,  viewers can't argue that Carrey doesn't portray Kaufman flawlessly. Fans of  Kaufman will be thrilled to see him come alive once again and for two hours  forget his career was cut short and be mesmerized as Carrey does what  Kaufman did best-- confuse people with his comedy.  The film isn't a  biography but instead a tribute to the late comedian. Carrey engages the  audience with his portrayal of Kaufman and director Milos Forman shows both  Kaufman on-screen and off. While the real Kaufman turned many people off,  the way ""Man on the Moon"" is set up gives the audience a sense of  understanding Kaufman, something even the real Andy Kaufman could never  accomplish. We not only see the zany comic but also the man off camera  trying to top his every act. In other words, the public gets to see the  comic AND the person that made up Kaufman-- something that was never shown  until now.  Whatever you felt about Kaufman or feel about Carrey, leave  it at the door. To miss this film is a huge mistake. Not only will viewers  possibly learn to appreciate Kaufman and, gasp!, like him, but critics who  think Jim Carrey is ""just a comedian"" will realize how wrong they were. For  viewers who felt Carrey was robbed at last year's Academy Awards for his  performance as Truman Burbank, they will be three times as shocked when  they realize how much he deserved this year's Oscar for Best Actor as Andy  Kaufman.  Carrey wasn't the only one overlooked for an Oscar. Forman  does his best directing since ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and leads a  talented cast in a funny and poignant film. Co-star Courtney Love is  amazing as Kaufman's girlfriend, showing once again that she is one of the  few singer-turned-actresses that CAN act, and Danny DeVito's portrayal of  Kaufman's agent is his best work to date.  If you want to rent a film  that will make you laugh, make you think, and do the unthinkable-  understand one of Hollywood's most confusing and underappriciated comics-  rent ""Man on the Moon.""

When I heard it was directed by Milos Forman, creator of 3 of my favorite films ('One flew over the cuckoo's nest', 'Amadeus', and 'The people vs Larry Flynt'), I started chomping at the bit. I saw an early clip of Jim Carrey's astounding imitation of Kaufman, and at that point was prepared to give it early entry into my 'Top 40 films ever' list, without even seeing it! This, to me, appeared to be the definiton of a 'can't miss' movie.Sadly, I was way off. Just as Forman and, in the end, Carrey himself were in the making of this huge disappointment. In the 3 Forman films I listed above, as well as 'Ragtime', another critically lauded picture of his, the last description i ever expected to attach to the Acadamy Award winning director's output would be ""by the numbers"". But that's exactly what this formulaic, phony feeling effort is.Besides numerous gaffes, which is unforgivable in as bland and distant as this film feels, the movie does the one thing Kaufman himself NEVER did-become predictable. In the end, the only memorable thing about the entire project is Carrey's impression of Kaufman, which is a sad statement indeed.

In a world of 'Got Talents' and 'X-Factors', a world where people will do anything to be famous, even degrading themselves and selling-out their dignity for life, Andy Kaufman may not have been so notorious. Whatever you think of the man, be he nothing more than a self-sabotaging fool who did whatever he could keep his name in the media, or a comic genius who was well ahead of the curve, there's no denying that Andy Kaufman was unique.I had no idea who he was until I saw this film, in Las Vegas on December 30th 1999. It the final movie I saw in the 20th century, a reminder of the more innocent, naive times we were gradually slipping away from.Carrey (a horribly under-rated dramatic actor) completely becomes Kaufman. It's an amazing transformation. It bothers me when people just see him as Ace Ventura. Carrey and Kaufman are symbiotic when it comes to comedy and pathos. It's a role he was born to play (along with the obnoxious Tony Clifton), and it's such a shame that the film didn't perform better at the box office.But a guess that a 'downer' film of a strange, long-dead, has-been comedian was not really something America wanted during the Xmas season of 1999. It was better than Stuart Little, that's for sure.The film is loaded with cameos from actors who actually worked and interacted with Kaufman before his unusual premature death including David Letterman, Jerry Lawler, Christoper Lloyd, Carol Kane, and Danny DeVito.However, I'm one of those people that believe that Andy is still alive.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and looks absolutely terrible.

If you haven't seen this masterpiece, and you aren't familiar with Andy Kaufman, this might end up being a really odd movie, but then again, Andy was definitely one of THE ALL-TIME STRANGEST persons this planet hasever seen.

70118,A52KLE5Q8THJN,0783241313,Jo Blo,"[1, 6]","I remember hearing about this movie when it came out around 1999, it was around the time I was beginning to buy DVDs of some movies I liked (I paid 44$CAN for my first DVD ever, ""Tomorrow Never Dies""). I didn't knew it was a Milos Forman movie so I wasn't even interested, I tought that the picture on the cover looked somewhat ridiculous. It was after I rented the movie ""The Peoples VS Larry Flynt"" that I decided to see it, since the two movies were written by the same writers and directed by Milos Forman, so I figured it would be another classic. It turned out to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a while, it have been so horribly mangled that the ""Milos Forman"" touch is not even present at all... As far as I'm concerned there's so much holes and continuity errors in the story that seeing it is a complete waste of time, I wouldn't call this a good memorial to Andy Kaufman's legacy, it would be more of an insult... I believe that since Milos Forman named his two latest childrens Andrew and Jim in honor of Andy Kaufman, my opinion is that there was a misunderstanding regarding the real Tony Clifton, who is apparently still alive and played himself uncredited in this movie. In any case a few years ago around 2008 I read the original script I found on the internet, with some imagination it give a glimpse of how it was intended to be originally, and it's easy to see it would have been of the same quality as the movie ""The Peoples VS Larry Flynt"", a ""10"" out of ""10"". Among other things, there was supposed to be a scene where Andy Kaufman is robbed after going out of the nightclub where he met his manager George Shapiro, and he act with the burglars as if he was on stage acting.

70120,A1Q0UFY6YKH3V,0783241313,Jon Eric Davidson,"[7, 8]","I admit to not knowing much about Andy Kaufman or his career, other than what we saw on &quot;Taxi&quot; and the notorious events he staged in his  career (the fight on Letterman's show, his intergender wrestling). I  suppose this lack of understanding probably led to my lukewarm reaction  after watching &quot;Man On The Moon&quot;.Andy Kaufman was an  incredibly complex individual - that much is made certain in this film. No  one - even those closest to him - knew exactly where he was coming from,  what his ultimate goals were, or what he would do next. I now know that it  makes for an incredibly difficult task in harnessing this character into a  bio-pic.The movie itself I found to be only marginal. The story seemed  to rush along and, in the end, didn't scratch much deeper than the surface  in understanding the drive or &quot;genius&quot; of Kaufman. The  &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; portions of the plot were weakly developed  and didn't go far in explaining Kaufman. Instead, we are treated to quick,  reproduced bursts of those infamous highlights in his career that most are  already familiar with.Credit should go to the producers for being able  to rein in David Letterman, Lorne Michaels, Richard Belzer, Christopher  Lloyd, Judd Hirsch, Carol Kane, and Marilu Henner (among others) in cameo  roles to reprise these moments. There was criticism from many reviewers who  were bothered by the fact that all the people in their cameos were 20-30  years older in the film. Obviously, this could not be helped, but everyone  in these roles (with perhaps the notable exception of Letterman) got enough  work done to look somewhat younger. And to be honest, the age issue isn't  that much of a distraction; rather, it's neat to see them take part.The  single, overwhelming element that raises &quot;Man On The Moon&quot; from a  poor movie to an average one is the performance of Jim Carrey in the lead  role. He has gotten consistently better in his roles - perhaps because he  expanded beyond low-brow comedies in recent years - and this one ranks as a  capstone right next to his similarly outstanding role in &quot;The Truman  Show&quot;. This role, like &quot;The Truman Show&quot; before it (which I  would perhaps rank his slightly better than this), is also noteworthy in  being Oscar-worthy, but which resulted in his second consecutive snub from  the Academy. His portrayal of Andy Kaufman is top-notch. Carrey is so good  in this role that you can honestly forget that he is only PORTRAYING  Kaufman. Rarely can actors achieve this sort of convincing performance.  Carrey single-handedly drives all the  energy and emotion in this picture.  In the course of the two hours, he was able to evoke laughs, shock, disgust  (in his portrayal of Kaufman alter-ego Tony Clifton), and tears from this  reviewer. Again, it is rare to find a performance that can do that.In  the end though, I was just left to scratch my head. It leaves one to be  even more perplexed by the unique entertainer that was Andy Kaufman. It  also leaves you spending a few minutes trying to figure out if you actually  liked the film. But, after it sinks in, one realizes that the real pull is  the outstanding performance from Jim Carrey, which unfortunately was  trapped in an average film. I would recommend to most to save their money  and rent the movie if only to see Carrey's performance. Those who are big  fans of Andy Kaufman and who believe understood his brand of entertainment  will probably find this to be a worthwhile purchase.",3,Carrey's outstanding...movie's OK,966297600,"08 15, 2000",2000,3539,"['admit', 'not', 'knowing', 'much', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'career', 'other', 'what', 'saw', 'quot', 'Taxi', 'quot', 'notorious', 'events', 'staged', 'career', 'fight', 'Letterman', 'show', 'intergender', 'wrestling', 'suppose', 'lack', 'understanding', 'probably', 'led', 'lukewarm', 'reaction', 'watching', 'quot', 'Man', 'Moon', 'quot', '.Andy', 'Kaufman', 'was', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'individual', 'much', 'made', 'certain', 'film', 'one', 'even', 'closest', 'knew', 'exactly', 'where', 'was', 'coming', 'what', 'ultimate', 'goals', 'were', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'next', 'now', 'know', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'task', 'harnessing', 'character', 'bio-pic.The', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'only', 'marginal', 'story', 'seemed', 'rush', 'along', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'scratch', 'much', 'deeper', 'surface', 'understanding', 'drive', 'quot', 'genius', 'quot', 'Kaufman', 'quot', 'behind-the-scenes', 'quot', 'portions', 'plot', 'were', 'weakly', 'developed', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'explaining', 'Kaufman', 'Instead', 'are', 'treated', 'quick', 'reproduced', 'bursts', 'infamous', 'highlights', 'career', 'most', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'with.Credit', 'should', 'go', 'producers', 'being', 'able', 'rein', 'David', 'Letterman', 'Lorne', 'Michaels', 'Richard', 'Belzer', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'Marilu', 'Henner', 'others', 'cameo', 'roles', 'reprise', 'moments', 'was', 'criticism', 'many', 'reviewers', 'who', 'were', 'bothered', 'fact', 'people', 'cameos', 'were', '20-30', 'years', 'older', 'film', 'Obviously', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'helped', 'everyone', 'roles', 'perhaps', 'notable', 'exception', 'Letterman', 'got', 'enough', 'work', 'done', 'look', 'somewhat', 'younger', 'be', 'honest', 'age', 'issue', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'distraction', 'rather', 'neat', 'see', 'take', 'part.The', 'single', 'overwhelming', 'element', 'quot', 'Man', 'Moon', 'quot', 'poor', 'movie', 'average', 'one', 'performance', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'lead', 'role', 'gotten', 'consistently', 'better', 'roles', 'perhaps', 'expanded', 'low-brow', 'comedies', 'recent', 'years', 'one', 'capstone', 'right', 'next', 'similarly', 'outstanding', 'role', 'quot', 'Truman', 'Show', 'quot', 'role', 'quot', 'Truman', 'Show', 'quot', 'would', 'perhaps', 'rank', 'slightly', 'better', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'being', 'Oscar-worthy', 'resulted', 'second', 'consecutive', 'snub', 'Academy', 'portrayal', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'top-notch', 'Carrey', 'so', 'good', 'role', 'can', 'honestly', 'forget', 'only', 'PORTRAYING', 'Kaufman', 'Rarely', 'can', 'actors', 'achieve', 'sort', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Carrey', 'single-handedly', 'drives', 'energy', 'emotion', 'picture', 'course', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'able', 'evoke', 'laughs', 'shock', 'disgust', 'portrayal', 'Kaufman', 'alter-ego', 'Tony', 'Clifton', 'tears', 'reviewer', 'Again', 'rare', 'find', 'performance', 'can', 'do', 'that.In', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'left', 'scratch', 'head', 'one', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'perplexed', 'unique', 'entertainer', 'was', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'also', 'spending', 'few', 'minutes', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'actually', 'liked', 'film', 'one', 'real', 'pull', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'trapped', 'average', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'most', 'save', 'money', 'rent', 'movie', 'only', 'see', 'Carrey', 'performance', 'who', 'are', 'big', 'fans', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'who', 'believe', 'brand', 'entertainment', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'purchase']",Man on the Moon VHS

70122,A4KWEJ17QCZQK,0783241313,"Joshua M. ""Joshua""","[0, 0]","When MAN ON THE MOON was released in 1999, I was not very familiar with who ANDY KAUFMAN was. I mean, I knew some of the basics about him. I knew he was the ""foreign man"" on the televivion show ""TAXI"". I vaguely remembered him being slapped in the face by Jerry Lawler on the David Letterman Show many years before, although I didn't know why. Other than that I was in the dark as to who this Andy Kaufman guy really was. So when I heard that Milos Foreman the director of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"" and (my fav) ""The People Versus Larry Flynt"", was making a film about Andy's life Starring (my favorite actor of the time) Jim Carrey, I decided to do some research. Once I did, I was very intrigued to see this film. Jim Carrey (THE CABLE GUY, BATMAN FOREVER, THE TRUMAN SHOW) seemed like the perfect fit for the hilarious Kaufman. That was the first thing I was wrong about. As much as I like Jim Carrey, all I saw when I watched ""MAN ON THE MOON"" was...Jim Carrey. When I watch a movie I want to get sucked in to the story and watch the characters progress and develop. It is very hard to do that while watching ""MAN ON THE MOON"" because again, all you see is Jim Carrey, not Andy Kaufman. It's distracting. Not to take anything away from Jim, because he is STILL one of my favorite actors. I feel that they should have gone with a lesser known star than him. I had read at the time that Edward Norton was the other front runner for the title role. He would have been perfect! ALthough he had been in some great movies before then like ""AMERICAN HISTORY X"" and ""PRIMAL FEAR"", he was not, in 1999 anyway as popular as say...Jim Carrey. Edward directed a movie a few years later called ""KEEPING THE FAITH"" and in one scene you hear a message Edward Norton's character leaves on an answering machine and he does an excellent ""Tank you vedy much"" impression of Kaufman's character LATKA. Anyway, the other problems that I (unfortunately) found with ""MAN ON THE MOON"" was the script, witten by Scott Alexander & Larry Karazewski was waaaaay to short and left out so many wonderful and hilarious things that Kaufman did in his life. This team, who also wrote the screenplays for Tim Burton's ""ED WOOD"" and Foreman's ""THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT"" shocked me with how underdevloped they had written the characters and the scenes. ""ED WOOD"" & ""THE PEOPLE VS.LARRY FLYNT"" were phenomenal scripts turned into great movies. However, they must have had trouble with Kaufman as a person/character for them to develop him well enough. Was he REALLY insane? A Comic Genius? A Scam Artist? A Nice Guy? A Mean Guy, who care about noone's feelings but his own? Who knows but Andy himself? I must however give Jim Carrey a tip of my hat for his portrayal of Kaufman's alter ego Tony Clifton. A ""world renowned"" performer and lounge singer, Carrey did an amazing job with that character. His portrayal of Kaufman however, seems flat and forced.And casting Danny DeVito (DEATH TO SMOOCHY, BATMAN RETURNS, THROW MAMMA FROM THE TRAIN) as Andy's manager was a mistake to me as, DeVito was Kaufman's costar on ""TAXI"". I also thought the editing in this movie was hacked. Foreman does do a good job recreating some scenes though. The recreation of Kaufman doing the ""Mighty Mouse"" theme on ""Saturday Night Live"" was well done. The recreation of the wrestling matches were entertaining and very funny at times. As well as the ""FRIDAY'S"" show and ""The David Letterman Show"" were good too. Other than that, I don't know what they were thinking. ""MAN ON THE MOON"" is worth seeing if you aren't familiar with Andy Kaufman. You would have to do more of your own research after (or before) seeing it to get the whole story. Maybe one day we will get a great bio film of the late comic genius. Until then we will have to settle for this one.

He is no longer going for the formulaic Dumb-Ventura's-Mask roles, but he has actually taken films more seriously and given drama's a thought. He did this in the exceptional Truman Show, and here he puts as much effort in as he did in The Truman Show. Carrey has shown us superbly that he can be humorous and dramatic, and that he can do it maturely and amazingly.Man on the Moon is a biopic based on the life of Andy Kaufman (Carrey), an eccentric comedian who went onto enjoy a career as lovable foreign car mechanic Latka Gravas on TV's &quot;Taxi&quot; and later gained infamy as an inter-gender wrestling champ. The film studies some of Kaufman's comedy antics as well as his personal life and his relationship with his manager George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), his best friend/partner Bob Zmuda (Paul Gimatti) and his girlfriend Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love).Man on the Moon is sometimes uneven and some unnecessary characters ploy into the story a bit too much at times, but this still remains reasonably fascinating and entertaining. At the start, this film is extremely funny, in particular the part where Carrey sings his ""and the cat goes..."" childhood song, but at the end of the day, Man on the Moon is a flat-out drama with a heartbreaking and dramatic climax. DeVito and Love share the silver screen nicely and both put in watchable and creditable performances, but it is Carrey who has suceeded in giving one of the best performances of 1999, and he should have been nominated for an Oscar, but thank God for the Golden Globes, where Carrey deservedly won over actors like Robert DeNiro and Sean Penn for his amazing on-screen performance.Man on the Moon is a surprising and tragic flick, and it'll occasionally warm your heart.

70126,A12XHDA7T4IP6J,0783241313,Kenneth Vestergaard,"[34, 38]","First of all, I would like to say that this is a great movie -- you'll find yourself totally immersed into the universe of Andy Kaufman during this movie (at least I was). Before I saw this movie, I had never seen  anything by Andy Kaufman (although I tried to change that fact prior to  seeing the movie, but since I live in Denmark, it's hard getting any of his  stuff) -- right after seeing it, I went straight home and ordered some of  his work on DVD.Also, anyone who has seen this movie must agree with me,  in that Jim Carrey was at least ripped for an Oscar nomination for Best  Actor, if not the Oscar statue itself. I can only imagine that it is very  rare when an actor is nominated for Best Actor at the Golden Globe Awards,  wins the Golden Globe, and doesn't even get nominated for an Oscar? I've  lost most of my respect for the Academy.Don't be fooled by the fact that  this movie didn't sell as good as most of the other Jim Carrey movies --  this is definitely his best performance so far (though not as funny as some  of his previous blockbusters, this movie is not intended to be a  &quot;full-blown&quot; comedy).The DVD release looks great too. Not only  do you get a great movie at a great price, you also get a lot of extras at  that price, something which is rare these days when you often pay somewhat  extra to get the &quot;collectors edition&quot; or &quot;special  edition&quot;. I'm a huge R.E.M. fan too, so the inclusion of two R.E.M.  music videos (&quot;Man on the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Great Beyond&quot;)  is simply great!",5,Jim Carrey deserved an Oscar and didn't even get nominated!,955238400,"04 9, 2000",2000,1562,"['First', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'great', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'find', 'totally', 'immersed', 'universe', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'movie', 'least', 'was', 'saw', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'tried', 'change', 'fact', 'prior', 'seeing', 'movie', 'live', 'Denmark', 'hard', 'getting', 'stuff', 'right', 'seeing', 'went', 'straight', 'home', 'ordered', 'work', 'DVD.Also', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'movie', 'must', 'agree', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'was', 'least', 'ripped', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', 'not', 'Oscar', 'statue', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'very', 'rare', 'when', 'actor', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Awards', 'Golden', 'Globe', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'nominated', 'Oscar', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'most', 'respect', 'Academy.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'fact', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'as', 'good', 'most', 'other', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'movies', 'definitely', 'best', 'performance', 'so', 'far', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'previous', 'blockbusters', 'movie', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'quot', 'full-blown', 'quot', 'comedy', 'DVD', 'release', 'great', 'too', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'get', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'price', 'also', 'get', 'lot', 'extras', 'price', 'something', 'rare', 'days', 'when', 'often', 'pay', 'somewhat', 'extra', 'get', 'quot', 'collectors', 'edition', 'quot', 'quot', 'special', 'edition', 'quot', ""'m"", 'huge', 'R.E.M', 'fan', 'too', 'inclusion', 'two', 'R.E.M', 'music', 'videos', 'quot', 'Man', 'Moon', 'quot', 'quot', 'Great', 'Beyond', 'quot', 'simply', 'great']",Man on the Moon VHS

Jim Carrey obviously threw himself into the role and gave  it everything he had, and did a dead-on impression of him. But I guess I am  one of the few people who couldn't forget that I was watching Carrey do a  dead-on Kaufman, and also thought from time to time, &quot;Edward Norton  resembled him much more&quot;. Carrey is just too good-looking (he is a  really handsome guy, when he's not making some horrible face) though he  obviously gained weight, looked as unattractive as possible, etc. There was  just the usual problem that biopics have, where you can't help but notice  that the person playing them is much better looking ( though there are some  exceptions to this rule). That being said, I still had a great time, and am  not sorry I went to see it- I was quite entertained. (though I wish they'd  included his sobbing-playing-the-bongos routine). A good movie to see on  Christmas Eve like we did, with the Carnegie Hall scene and all, and it did  actually make me teary. DeVito was great as his frustrated manager.  Courtney Love was in it less than I thought, fortunately. SO, to sum up,  though I'm not a big fan of Kaufman, (don't dislike him, just can take him  or leave him) I recommend it for the performances and filmmaking. Also, it  was fun seeing the cast of Taxi back in their old roles-Marilu Henner was  the only one who couldn't pull off being 20 years younger (not trying to be  catty- I really did think she'd look about the same, but it was obvious  she'd lost weight and had some 'work' done on her face).

Carrey does capture the essence of Andy Kaufman, but this is the only redeeming feature of this ponderously long and distressing  movie.  As this film so dutifully conveys, Kaufman was a true enigma.  His greatest pleasure in life it seems was putting people on - playing jokes on them and then laughing about how clever he was.  Self-absorbed? - perhaps.  Insecure? - Maybe.  Narcissistic? - Who knows?  Unfortunately, one really does not learn anything substantive about Andy Kaufman the person by watching the story of his life.  Remarkable really - not one ""real"" moment where we see the inner soul of andy Kaufman.  I actually learned more about his life by reading a Wikipedia article about him, and from that single article, I found many factual discrepancies in the film. Perhaps Andy Kaufman never wanted people to know him, so he invented his strange characters to hide behind.  Again, Kaufman is a mystery wrapped up in a secret, wrapped up in a charade, and this movie does nothing to pull away the veneer.  As a fan of Andy Kaufman, I was greatly disappointed in this production.This movie deserves a 1-star rating if not for Jim Carrey's portrayal of Kaufman.

70132,A8BD1DS7JUB2E,0783241313,kreisleriana16,"[2, 9]","I really wish I could like this movie.  After Jim Carrie's performance in the &quot;Truman Story&quot; and seeing him do the &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; routine I had high hopes that this would be a movie worth seeing regarding a comedian who - like others - I loved and hated at the same time.What we have instead is Jim Carrey playing Jim Carrey imitating Andy Kaufman on, at best, a story that is most likely based on guess and golly.  After seeing the excellent presentation NBC had on Kaufman which I taped I found the movie a major disappointment.The best part of the film is at the beginning with Carrie imitating the Mighty Mouse routine and Kaufman doing his Elvis impersonation.  We see tidbits of his childhood which followed the NBC presentation rather well.  The movie brings back the cast of &quot;Taxi&quot; - my how everyone's aged over the years.Was it supposition concerning Kaufman's trying to get people upset with his alter-ego character Tony Clifton.  Did this same character really create chaos on the &quot;Taxi&quot; set?  (If anything I thought that the Tony Clifton character was better played than the Andy Kaufman character at times.The wrestling business again: was this a put on as the movie indicates up to and including his match both in the ring and on the Letterman show with Jerry Lawler.  Speaking of Letterman, while we can appreciate using the real people it seemed rather sad to see the present Letterman who is nowhere as funny and creative as the Letterman from the 1980's playing himself.  I can clearly remember Andy Kaufman doing his wrestling on Saturday Night Live and how a number of people disliked what he was doing.The bit about Kaufman working in a fast food restaurant was true.  The fact that a lot of people thought his cancer was just another Kaufman routine was true.  One of the issues that we may never know is this: was Kaufman really so creative and so &quot;avant garde&quot; that he was way ahead of his audiance, or was he at times three cards short of a full deck?  The movie never answered that either.For those of us who can remember the real Andy Kaufman - both the bad and good - this movie just seems to be lacking in where fact stops and fiction starts.I have seen other movies where the viewer can all but imagine the actor being the person he is playing.  &quot;Nixon&quot; with Anthony Hopkins is one example.  In &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; all we have his Jim Carrey playing Jim Carrey imitating Andy Kaufman as I mentioned before.As for Jim Carrey, before I saw this movie I wondered why he wasn't even considered for an Oscar nomination. After seeing it I can understand why.  We have had comedians before who have been able to cross the fine line between being a comic and an actor.  Robin Williams comes to mind for some of the great work he has done.  Carrey can be very funny and has the ability to imitate and mimic other actors.  He showed that he could play a serious role in &quot;The Truman Story&quot;.  It appears that Carrey still has a lot more work to do to try to cross over to being a serious actor and not a comic.If you do want to watch the  movie rent the VHS tape.

Such total immerson is always fascinating as is the public reaction.  If  you do it in a dramatic film (As in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; or  &quot;Shine&quot;) you can win an Oscar.  But you do not need the Academy  to tell you this is not a dramatic film.  However, I really believe the  best way of considering this film is to focus on the director more than the  star.The best parts of this film are at the beginning and the end.  The  opening sequence is simple Kaufmanesque, which, in retrospect, is a  brilliant ploy.  It sets the mood perfectly.  At the end, with Kaufman's  trip to the Philippines, is the final punchline to his life.  Of course I  do not want to give it away, but if you consider it from the perspective of  Kaufman as the comedian who always cried &quot;wolf,&quot; you have to  appreciate the supreme irony of the moment which sums up Kaufman's life,  both symbolically and literally.Note.  Even though the cast credits  are not at the end of the film, please make a point of staying around until  the end of the credits.  It is not a big joke, it is simply a pleasant  surprise.I watched this film with my kids who know nothing about Andy  Kaufman.  They knew who Carol Kane was from &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;  and whathizface from all those &quot;Back to the Future Movies.&quot;  What  was interesting to me was that they bit on the entire movie.  No matter how  many times Andy cried wolf, they fell for it.  At the end they were  convinced he was not really dead.Regarding the deleted scenes, I  remember seeing Zmuda tear apart Kaufman's act on cable.  I wish it had  been kept in the film, because its one of his better triple twists.This is not a great film, but it is a very good film, especially given  its subject matter. If you do not like Kaufman, or are not willing to at  least give him a shot, you probably will not like the movie.  Nobody thinks  Kaufman walked a fine line.  He was over it.  If that bothers you, then you  will not like this movie.  You have to take him at face value (and, yes, I  appreciate the irony of that comment).",4,Milos Forman creates a Kaufmanesque Film,968025600,"09 4, 2000",2000,2160,"['Most', 'commentary', 'film', 'focused', 'Carey', 'portrayal', 'Kaufman', 'Such', 'total', 'immerson', 'always', 'fascinating', 'public', 'reaction', 'do', 'dramatic', 'film', 'quot', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'quot', 'quot', 'Shine', 'quot', 'can', 'win', 'Oscar', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'Academy', 'tell', 'not', 'dramatic', 'film', 'However', 'really', 'believe', 'best', 'way', 'considering', 'film', 'focus', 'director', 'more', 'star.The', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'beginning', 'end', 'opening', 'sequence', 'simple', 'Kaufmanesque', 'retrospect', 'brilliant', 'ploy', 'mood', 'perfectly', 'end', 'Kaufman', 'trip', 'Philippines', 'final', 'punchline', 'life', 'course', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'away', 'consider', 'perspective', 'Kaufman', 'comedian', 'who', 'always', 'cried', 'quot', 'wolf', 'quot', 'have', 'appreciate', 'supreme', 'irony', 'moment', 'up', 'Kaufman', 'life', 'symbolically', 'literally.Note', 'Even', 'cast', 'credits', 'are', 'not', 'end', 'film', 'please', 'make', 'point', 'staying', 'around', 'end', 'credits', 'not', 'big', 'joke', 'simply', 'pleasant', 'surprise.I', 'watched', 'film', 'kids', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'knew', 'who', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'was', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'quot', 'whathizface', 'quot', 'Back', 'Future', 'Movies.', 'quot', 'What', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'bit', 'entire', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'Andy', 'cried', 'wolf', 'fell', 'end', 'were', 'convinced', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'dead.Regarding', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Zmuda', 'tear', 'apart', 'Kaufman', 'act', 'cable', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'kept', 'film', 'one', 'better', 'triple', 'twists.This', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'especially', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'do', 'not', 'Kaufman', 'are', 'not', 'willing', 'least', 'give', 'shot', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'Nobody', 'Kaufman', 'walked', 'fine', 'line', 'was', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'have', 'take', 'face', 'value', 'yes', 'appreciate', 'irony', 'comment']",Man on the Moon VHS

70135,A141K4HOXTWDA6,0783241313,lenny,"[6, 6]","&quot;Man on the Moon&quot; is definitely underappreciated.  One of its criticisms is that Foreman never explores Kaufman's personal life.  But in all honesty, and due respect to the director's artistry, that's not what his goal was.  The reason the film is so great is, it makes you feel as if you're watching Andy Kaufman.  According to Kaufman's real-life acquaintences, working with Carrey was frighteningly like working with Andy, and that's the true magic behind the film.What stirs my interest is like many people my age, I went in thinking it was just another comical Jim Carrey performance, and what I got out of it was something that stuck with me.  Here was this totally believable character, this rising comic, who didn't make a whole lot of sense and doesn't try to define what he is or what he wants to do.  I went through an emotional ride, at first shaking my head and asking myself, &quot;What's with this guy?  And furthermore, where's the movie going?&quot;  As it turns out, the reason why many people disliked Andy was the simple fact that they were never let in on the joke.  He was known for taking things to the extreme.  Yet, the movie dramatically emphasizes all the jokes, and for me instantly transformed him into as lovable a character as his imitations, namely Foreign Man and Tony Clifton.Some movies are great for certain people, because there's something about it that's personal for the viewer.  &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; is that type of movie.  At the time I saw it, I was working with my own brand of comedy, and I was able to immediately relate to him.  It was one of those films that I can honestly say changed the way I look at my own life.  As little as I know about Milos Foreman, he's quickly become one of the directors I've grown respect for.

70139,AESY8NCX6VS6O,0783241313,M. Burns,"[0, 0]","Director Milos Forman likes biopics, and he loves his cast from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Both of those things are both evident and inextricable from his 1999 film about the life of legendary 70's/80's comedian Andy Kauffman, a movie I found more enriching in its faith in its subject than its actual craft as a life-of film. But boy does Moon believe Kauffman, played to a &quot;T&quot; by Jim Carrey, was a genius. At least 75% of the film re-enacts, in detail, his notorious acts (disguising himself as a chauvenistic, mean-spirited lounge singer; reading the entire Great Gatsby to a college crowd; verbally assaulting a stadium full of wrestling fans), but the movie also wisely does its best to explain why Kauffman was so revolutionary. After seeing Man on the Moon, I believe it.Kauffman's brand of comedy was like shock humor in concept, not content, and such an elaborate concept is communicated so well in Moon that I just enjoyed seeing what the guy would pull next. The movie skimps on his personal life quite a bit, introducing Courtney Love as the love of his life, but never giving her much of a chance onscreen; and I would have liked to have seen more about his days in between childhood and fame. But these are quibbles about a movie that truly understands, in the deepest way, the strange art of its subject. I saw Pollock recently and was enraptured by the story of the man, but bored with the movie's presentation of it. Man on the Moon works as both comedy and insightful biography, and even if you've never heard of Andy Kauffman before, you're likely to 'get' him just like a lifelong fan would. For newcomers to Kauffman's life (hey, most of us reading this weren't around then), it's a blast seeing his outrageous stunts, and it's a testament to the movie that it's just as moving in the end as it was funny all along.

70140,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,0783241313,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[5, 6]","Definitely not my favourite Jim Carrey film, but he was very good in it. If you didn't know, or didn't like Andy Kaufman (played by Jim Carrey), then this film will not really appeal to you.I've known the ""Man On The Moon"" song by R.E.M. for quite a while, and always wondered about the `Andy Kaufman' mentioned in it. I'd never heard of the film, or Andy Kaufman, up until I saw a couple of clips from it, and then watched it at home. The film as a whole, was good, and I enjoyed Jim Carrey as he is a great actor. I didn't get much of Andy Kaufman's humour. I found Tony Clifton quite amusing, when he was singing, but it did get VERY confusing. Andy Kaufman was Tony Clifton and Tony Clifton was Andy Kaufman - maybe! I suppose everyone has their own alter ego, but these two go beyond the confines of that! My dad worked out who was playing Tony Clifton when the two of them were on stage, before I did, and that's what I thought at the end . . . But the last shot ruined that thought!I found the film very slow to begin with, and some of the various characters weren't introduced very well, including his parents and Bob. My favourite bits in the film were: Andy Kaufman playing his bongos to the audience, and getting them to sing along; Andy Kaufman's Elvis impersonation (how HOT did he look?); and the very start of the film was hilarious. It must have been a projectionist's nightmare at the cinema!The ending was very sad, and Jim Carrey looked very strange lying in the coffin. And then it goes on a bit, and you see something that makes you think about the whole film. Believe me, it's a film you will remember, whether you liked it or hated it. The feeling you get will stay with you. Was it Andy Kaufman's final prank? None of his friends believed him when he said he was dying, and everyone believed it was just another one of his tricks. But it's impossible that he can come back 19 years after his death. What happened, happened. And he died well before his time. His humour probably wasn't appreciated in his time, but it may or may not be appreciated now. He's like Elvis in a way . . . went before his time.If you're not old enough to remember the TV series, ""Taxi"" (1978-83), then you may not know who Andy Kaufman was. Some of the original cast of ""Taxi"" appeared in Man On The Moon, including Christopher Lloyd.The extras were quite interesting on the DVD. I found the deleted scenes not very helpful - sometimes they can add an extra insight to the film - and I thought one particular deleted scene should have stayed in. Warning: if you watch the film, and then watch the very first extra (Spotlight On Location: The Making Of Man On The Moon) straight away, you end up even MORE confused! I was also glad to see some of Andy Kaufman's original performances featured, although I couldn't find them to start with! It was shocking how Jim Carrey managed to become so similar looking to Andy - although the hair was a little OTT at times. I was glad to see the R.E.M. videos featured too, obviously, ""Man On The Moon"", and ""The Great Beyond"", as they are two great songs. Both had original concepts for videos, which is very unusual to see these days.All in all, it's not a film I would necessarily watch again.

70143,A2P6PVWZS4NGV0,0783241313,Michael Bulger,"[3, 6]","&quot;Man on the Moon&quot; is, as you undoubtedly already know, a film biopic of the late comedian/entertainer Andy Kaufman, with the irrepressible Jim Carrey in the starring role.  The film for the most part covers Kaufman's public life with sparing glimpses of the decisions and maneuvering that went on behind it; thus we are treated to his early routines on the stages of comedy clubs, his stint as a regular on the sitcom &quot;Taxi,&quot; his performance of the fictional lounge singer Tony Clifton, his foray into professional wrestling, first as the &quot;Intergender Wrestling Champion,&quot; then as the gadfly for the more conventional male wrestling star Jerry Lawler.Anyone looking to relive the truly odd, off-center entertainment that Kaufman provided, however, would be much better off finding a compilation of his best filmed performances.  Too often, this movie degenerates into just that, reaching its low point with a montage of scenes from &quot;Taxi&quot; that could have easily been lifted from a typical sitcom retrospective.  Anyone who is surprised by the &quot;revelation&quot; that Kaufman and Lawler were actors, and their rivalry a calculated fiction, or by any of the other behind-the-scenes portions of the film, is at the very least guilty of not paying attention during Kaufman's lifetime.  Given that this film provides no additional insight into Kaufman's life or personality, its value as biopic is questionable.Perhaps the biggest problem with the film, surprisingly enough, is Jim Carrey.  He inhabits the role as well as can be expected, but in the end he brings out more of the dark side of Kaufman's career than of a balanced portrait.  Kaufman's act was essentially one of &quot;I'm smarter than the audience&quot;; his basic premise was to trick the audience into reacting as he wanted them to, and he rarely intended to entertain anyone other than himself.  For all of that, his physical aspect--most notably a round, cherubish face--projected just enough guileless innocence that he was able to carry it off more often than not.  Carrey, on the other hand, for all of the work that must have gone into perfecting his imitation, has a sharply angular face that always appears devious.  He is more at home in the persona of the endlessly obnoxious Tony Clifton than the &quot;who, me?&quot; Kaufman, and as a result I'm not sure how someone who never saw Kaufman in the first place would ever understand how such a man could make a career with such an approach.Other quibbles are more minor:  the casting of several celebrities as themselves, despite the passage of nearly two decades between the events depicted and their re-enactment for this film; the intermittent descent into hagiography (Kaufman's soon-to-be manager:  &quot;You're insane...but you might also be brilliant.&quot;)  Regardless, I found more to dislike in this movie than to like, and found myself bored with it less than halfway through.

At one point in MAN ON THE MOON Andy's girlfriend tells him &quot;There is no real you&quot; and means it. Although I don't  believe it, I actually believe that both Kuafman and Sellers had  personalities in there somewhere I thank the heavens that Milos Forman  didn't try to find the &quot;real&quot; Andy Kuafman.  His ingenious  film, plays like one of Kuafmans acts. The audience in the theatre where I  saw it today where expecting to watch Andy irritate his audience and laugh  because they would be in on the joke. But THE ABSOLUTE GENIUS OF THIS FILM  IS THAT WE'RE NOT IN ON THE JOKE. We are in exactly in the same position  Andy's audiences were in back when he was doing his sketches. Most of the  time we don't know weather its a joke or real or a bizzare mixture of both.  No wonder then that half of the people in the theatre walked out about two  thirds of the way in. They were expecting a traditional biopic, which  starts with the discorvery of talent, the rise and the inevitable and  tragic fall. Instead we were as his audience was back then, toyed with and  involved in an elaborate scheme. He would have loved this movie.  Andy  Kuafman was revolutionary in that unlike almost every human being on the  planet, his actions were not to please or even leave a positive impression  on those around him, his primary audience was himself. Once the fear of  failure was out of the equation, the door was completely open for the most  bizzare and original acts to be created. And although he didn't nessecarily  want to please his audience he did want to have them, to toy with them. In  a way he was a behavioural scientist.  The film is beautifully made,  Courtney Love and Danny DeVito don't really give performances as much as  points of sanity to anchor the film. Without them we would be completely  lost in Kuafmans world. Now we come to Carrey's performance which is  incredible, he never lets on, never winks, he is what the Andy Kuafman  legend is, it is a riveting performance.  To those who walked out on this  film, or get bored and press stop on video &quot;You are disgusting and  here is a soap to clean yourself&quot;, just kidding.

In fact, all I remembered about him was that he was &quot;an eccentric comedian&quot;. As it turned out, the people from whom I received most input on Andy were the ones who didn't understand him and who never would. Taking just their wordswas my mistake - fortunately, Milos Forman and Jim Carrey helped me in learning the truth about Andy when they gifted the world with this splendid picture. It was thanks to &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; that I first really learned the biography of the dadaistic entertainer Andy Kaufman, and immediately set out to find out more about Andy, the golden human enigma. I loved the film and became fascinated by the character of Andy - undoubtedly thanks to Jim Carrey's brilliant, Oscar-worthy portrayal of his persona and his personality. Carrey already proved that he *is* a true Actor with &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, and with &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; he cemented this reputation. This is certainly the best role of his life - the best so far, of course. Yet even without Jim Carrey's performance &quot;MotM&quot; would stand on its own. The film is warm, embracing, involving and moving; it's one of few pictures made in recent years that will provoke deep reflections and thoughts staying with the viewer long after the screen goes black.Upon its release, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; was not received 1/10th as well as it should have been. This is only natural, however. Few films which deserve to be described as magnificent received proper recognition at the time of their release - just look at the reception the freshly-made SF masterpiece &quot;Solaris&quot; is getting at this moment (The situation was exactly the same with &quot;2001&quot;). Since it is speculated that mankind will be constantly developing intellectually, I assume that &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; *will* get the recognition it deserves in less than two decades. Or, at the very least, it will become a cult movie (Actually, it already seems to be gaining this status, although the process is slow...)My one big disappointment was the fact that the film ends so... quickly. Adding to it is the fact that some parts of Andy's biography are left unexplored (Interestingly, a number of critics took off points when reviewing the film for precisely the same reason). After all, if you love a film, you want it to go on for long hours, if not days... That's why I was so pleased to learn out that this DVD release would have numerous extra features - they certainly add to the pleasure of watching &quot;MotM&quot;, and enrich the experience.Thank you, Milos Forman and Jim Carrey - and thank you Andy, wherever your spirit may be now.",5,An underrated gem,1040083200,"12 17, 2002",2002,2727,"['was', 'guilty', 'not', 'knowing', 'much', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'seeing', 'film', 'fact', 'remembered', 'was', 'was', 'quot', 'eccentric', 'comedian', 'quot', 'turned', 'out', 'people', 'whom', 'received', 'most', 'input', 'Andy', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'who', 'never', 'would', 'Taking', 'just', 'wordswas', 'mistake', 'fortunately', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'helped', 'learning', 'truth', 'Andy', 'when', 'gifted', 'world', 'splendid', 'picture', 'was', 'thanks', 'quot', 'Man', 'Moon', 'quot', 'first', 'really', 'learned', 'biography', 'dadaistic', 'entertainer', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'immediately', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'Andy', 'golden', 'human', 'enigma', 'loved', 'film', 'became', 'fascinated', 'character', 'Andy', 'undoubtedly', 'thanks', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'brilliant', 'Oscar-worthy', 'portrayal', 'persona', 'personality', 'Carrey', 'already', 'proved', 'true', 'Actor', 'quot', 'Truman', 'Show', 'quot', 'quot', 'Man', 'Moon', 'quot', 'cemented', 'reputation', 'certainly', 'best', 'role', 'life', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'course', 'even', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'performance', 'quot', 'MotM', 'quot', 'would', 'stand', 'own', 'film', 'warm', 'embracing', 'involving', 'moving', 'one', 'few', 'pictures', 'made', 'recent', 'years', 'will', 'provoke', 'deep', 'reflections', 'thoughts', 'staying', 'viewer', 'long', 'screen', 'release', 'quot', 'Man', 'Moon', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'received', '1/10th', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'natural', 'however', 'Few', 'films', 'deserve', 'be', 'described', 'magnificent', 'received', 'proper', 'recognition', 'time', 'release', 'just', 'look', 'reception', 'freshly-made', 'SF', 'masterpiece', 'quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'getting', 'moment', 'situation', 'was', 'exactly', 'same', 'quot', '2001', 'quot', 'speculated', 'mankind', 'will', 'be', 'constantly', 'developing', 'intellectually', 'assume', 'quot', 'Man', 'Moon', 'quot', 'get', 'recognition', 'less', 'two', 'decades', 'very', 'least', 'will', 'become', 'cult', 'movie', 'Actually', 'already', 'be', 'gaining', 'status', 'process', 'slow', 'one', 'big', 'disappointment', 'was', 'fact', 'film', 'so', 'quickly', 'Adding', 'fact', 'parts', 'Andy', 'biography', 'are', 'left', 'unexplored', 'Interestingly', 'number', 'critics', 'took', 'off', 'points', 'when', 'reviewing', 'film', 'precisely', 'same', 'reason', 'love', 'film', 'want', 'go', 'long', 'hours', 'not', 'days', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'pleased', 'learn', 'out', 'DVD', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'numerous', 'extra', 'features', 'certainly', 'add', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'quot', 'MotM', 'quot', 'experience.Thank', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'thank', 'Andy', 'wherever', 'spirit', 'may', 'be', 'now']",Man on the Moon VHS

Although I find Carrey quite hillarious, there's nothing he could have possibly done to turn the life of an at-best mediocre comedian like Kauffman into a movie worth watching.Kaufmann practiced Zen Bhuddism with its mantra that one will only be enlightened and happy when they can hear the sound of one hand clapping. Although such a proverb seems strange, it means that one will never be happy in life unless they realize that they're the only show that's real: everything else is an ever-changing illusion. Thus, one is the only true star of the show of life who must laugh at their solitary existance. This is what Kaufmann believed and it's certainly manifested by his meaningless skits. He was a comedian primarily to himself and he was his own audience: he was never really interested in entertaining anyone else. For Kaufmann, the audience was the show to him. It's ironic that his role as Latka Gravas in &quot;Taxi&quot; was really his one and only claim to fame and it was the role he hated playing the most. The film itself is as stale and moronic as Kaufmann's humor and personality. If you want to be the object of an inside joke, then Kaufmann is the comedian for you.A very forgettable film about a very forgettable &quot;comedian.&quot; Throughout the movie, I was seriously debating whether to walk out and leave; the only reason I stayed was to be polite to my company. After watching such a boring movie about a boring comedian, I felt that Kaufmann got the better of me even from the grave by having me pay for a show that has nothing to show.

What can I say, I didn't get it and not from lack of trying for  I saw this dud twice. And yes, I do know who Andy Kaufman was and the sort  of comedy he made, but still I didn't get it! I was bored to death (was  that the joke?)!I understand Jim Carrey draws bigger crowds to the box  office than Edward Norton (Forman's other actor in mind for the role), but  ticket sales aside, this doesn't help the movie much. To begin with, Carrey  doesn't look at all like Andy Kaufman; he looks like Ace Ventura doing Andy  Kaufman, which gets quite annoying quite soon (was that the joke?); from  the very start, to be honest! Norton does look like him and, since he's no  comedian, one would've seen a portrayal, not a mere impersonation (was that  the joke?). But Hollywood being Hollywood, the bigger star the better, even  if it sinks the show altogether (was that the joke?).Yet the show would  have sunk anyway because there's no point to it (was that the joke?).

I, of course, did not realize his remarks and his wrestling were all a put-on by this master con man until much later.  By then, it was much too late and he had already died from cancer.You won't really learn much about Andy Kaufman from this movie - bits and pieces, but from the look of his life, no one really knew a lot about him. You never are told why his dad is so upset Andy is playing in his room by himself. You never get a grasp of what made Andy Kaufman constantly invent characters that people even loved or hated. His &quot;Latka&quot; character was brillant as well as funny. His &quot;Tony&quot; character was the portrait of an obnoxious lounge singer. He appeared to use everybody and everything as a huge prop to complete practical jokes. This may have been gunny to Andy, but lots of times, he was the only one who got the joke.Jim Carrey is fantastic as Andy Kaufman. Seeing Carrey do the &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; bit brought me back to the first time I seen the bit - fearing that Kaufman had simply became a victim of stage fright and than laughing as he pantomined the &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; song.Andy Kaufman was a complex and troubled man. He seemed determined to elicit extreme reactions from people, good or bad were the same to him. Just provoking the reaction was what he seemed to crave.I have to admit, I still don't understand Andy Kaufman and I still am not a big fan of his, but the movie was very thought provoking. On one hand, he is seen meditating, trying to become a more spiritual person - on the other hand he is seen being a total jerk to his co-workers for no apparent reason or at least no reason that is elaborated on in the movie.

70160,A13910TC3NZ6LE,0783241313,Sam Bethune,"[3, 4]","I've never been a fan of Andy Kaufman's work; in fact, I was rather put  off by it.  That said, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; does a very good job at  depicting Kaufman's life and career, although it does little more than  scratch the surface.Many thought of Kaufman as a comedian.  I do not.  Instead, I think of him as an artist who strived to produce emotion from  his audience, in whatever form, that he could feed from.  One need look no  further than the obnoxious Tony Clifton character to find evidence in  support of my theory.  Kaufman's five seasons on &quot;Taxi&quot; are given  rather short shrift, although in one scene we see Clifton at work on the  set.  I don't recall Clifton ever being on the show, but I do recall a  similar character named Vic Ferrari and was disappointed that he wasn't at  least mentioned.Although the film moved too quickly and the script was  shallow, the acting was first rate.  Once again, Jim Carrey turns in a  brilliant, top-drawer performance only to be snubbed by the Academy of  Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences(the first time was for his tour de force  performance in &quot;The Truman Show&quot;), and panned by worthless  critics like Leonard Maltin.  Paul Giamati is good as Andy's collaborator,  and Danny DeVito turns in a solid performance as George Shapiro, Kaufman's  manager.  Watch for the ubiquitous Vincent Schiavelli as a much put-upon  ABC exec.  Courtney Love was only so-so as the love interest.  Appearances  by Jeff Conaway, Marilu Henner, Judd Hirsch, and others round out the  cast.Two scenes in this movie stand out.  The first is Kaufman's  explosive behavior on the set of &quot;Fridays.&quot;  I saw the actual  show on which this incident took place and was very impressed with its  recreation on film.  The other is Kaufman's visit to a cancer treatment  center in the Phillippines where he discovers that the treatment is a sham,  much to his amusement.  The scene dissolves from Kaufman's laughing visage  to a haunting scene of him in his casket lying in repose at his funeral.  A  film of Andy leading the mourners in song is playing behind the open  casket.  This is truly a moving and emotional scene.Although &quot;Man  on the Moon&quot; really provides nothing more than a fleeting,  fast-forward glimpse through the life of Andy Kaufman, it is nevertheless a  good motion picture, much better than the negative reviews would have you  believe.

I do enjoy his comedies, but seriously Dumb and Dumber got old and was kind of a rip off of The Jerk with Steve Martin who did it better. Truman Show is unique and touching, use to be my favorite Carrey flick untill Eternal Sunshine and Man on the Moon blew me away. True Ace Ventura back in the day was pretty funny, but it got old. Carrey has grown out of that, but he still tends to do the flat out comedies like Bruce Almighty, which could have been sooo much better, since the fact he played God. Liar Liar is cute. Cable Guy is underated and is Carreys creepiest dark comical moment in film. Batman Forever was good the first time, but come on Val Kilmer as Batman? Man on the Moon blew me away the first time I watched it and I am still touched again seeing it for a second time. Kaufman did his own thing and didn't care what people thought, I respect that very much. Free will, experimental, controversy, entertainment, suspense, hate, love; Kaufman had it all and Jim Carrey brought him to life and people who knew him had chills by Carreys performance, because they felt like Andy was there with them. I never really knew anything about Andy Kaufman, except for SNL and Taxi, well theres more then I ever thought and I'm really intested in whatever he has done that is on video somewhere.

Andy Kauffman was a definite eccentric... either nuts, super creative or both.I remember seeing Andy live on Saturday  Night Live doing his &quot;MIghty Mouse&quot; routine and I grew up  watching Taxi... but I was a kid and I really had no idea of all the other  Andy antics, including the whole wrestling scene.I not only found the  film entertaining, but enlightening into an aspect this unique person's  life. There were moments where I was doubled-over with laughter and others  with a lump in my throat. A friend of mine told me that near the last year  of Kauffman's life, he traded in his meditation and metaphysical beliefs  and instead started looking back to faith in God and became quite religious  during the last months of his life during his battle w/ cancer. He also  became closer to his siblings and parents.  Since the film covered nearly  every other aspect of his life, including his childhood, it's a shame that  such an important part of someone's life was not included.  In that  respect, I would say that the film was more incomplete than inaccurate, but  showing an incomplete version of someone's life leaves a lasting wrong  impression. Nonetheless, this was a fine piece of movie making and superb  acting by Carrey, DaVito and the rest of the cast.There is nudity and  lots of language, so this isn't a film you'd want to show really young  kids.

Because Jim Carrey is classified  as a real wacky comedian, alot of people went to this movie expecting to  see another Ace Vantura. DO NOT expect this movie to be funny....it's not  supposed to be. It has a few funny parts, but is mostly a dramatic  documentary.When Andy wanted to be funny, he was. But most of the time,  he wasn't even trying to be funny. The bizarre and crazy things that he  did, was NOT for the audience's amusement....it was for his amusement, Bob  Zmuda's amusement and anyone who understood's amusement! Andy Kaufman was  all about being original and unpredictable.....he never did stand-up  comedy, he mocked it....he didn't find stand up humor to be funny, so he  made fun of it!  He was a man of confusion.....he screwed with people's  heads...made them think......Things aren't always what they seem to  be.And I don't care what anyone says, Jim Carrey did an outstanding job  at playing Andy. Sure, he wasn't DEAD ON....but come on, IT'S ONLY A  MOVIE!....Jim worked very hard at this role, and no one could have played a  better Andy Kaufman...Jim deserves more credit.I'm tired of people  saying that the movie is borring, and has no point....sure it does! The  point is perfectly clear.....it takes you through the career of Andy  Kaufman, while showing you some of his private life.  Maybe it doesn't show  every single thing that Andy did, but, come on......the movie would have to  be 6 hours long in order to mention EVERYTHING. Yes, Taxi was his most  known role...but the movie didn't focus a lot on Taxi, because Andy really  hated that show....it was a pay-check, nothing more. I'm surprized the  original cast even agreed to do &quot;Man On The Moon&quot; considering  most of them hated Andy kaufman. Did you know he never even watched an  episode of Taxi?I mean, what more do you people want?.....The movie  followed Andy's life the way it really happened. It would be wrong to make  up stuff that never took place.And the movie doesn't explain Andy's  behavior for one reason....BECAUSE THERE IS NO EXPLANATION....Get  it?.....I love Andy kaufman, and I LOVE this movie....if you don't  understand it...don't worry, you're not supposed to.

Andy Kaufman insisted that he wasn't a comedian but merely an entertainer, and Carrey is trying to squeeze himself into those shoes in this film, and not  quite making it to that level. After all the silly movies like &quot;Dumb  And Dumber&quot; and the Ace Ventura installments, I just can't take Jim  Carrey seriously, no matter how hard he tries. Yes, he is an excellent  imitator, ranging from his Clint Eastwood squint to his hound-dog visage  and slow draw of Jimmy Stewart, but this movie is hardly a stretch for him,  let alone serious acting.It really sounds like I'm ripping on the film,  but I'll tell you why I gave it the honorable denomination of three stars:  Carrey's uncanny mimicry of the infamous Kaufman and his spectacular  co-stars. Courtney Love has made a name for herself since her head-turning  performance as Althea Flynt in &quot;The People Vs Larry Flynt&quot;, and  is just as exceptional here as Kaufman's wild but warm-hearted girlfriend  Lynn Margulies. Another performance to credit is the always impressive  Danny DeVito, playing the eye in the sky who spots Kaufman's unusual and  original brain for performing.Carrey is again under the directorial  thumb of Milos Forman in this one, whom he first layed his comedic genius  aside for in the &quot;Truman Show&quot;.

Well, the answer is nothing, but that doesn't change the fact that Hollywood has become the enemy of the young and the ambitious.

70183,A243HY69GIAHFI,0783241313,tropic_of_criticism,"[1, 1]","As an introduction to the life of Andy Kaufman, MAN ON THE MOON succeeds well enough for most American viewers.  Jim Carrey's performance is, as  Kaufman's friends and family have said, like watching a psychic channel the  spirit of Kaufman himself.  Carrey's resemblance to Kaufman is positively  spooky.  If you know nothing of Kaufman, you'll come away from the film  with a sense of the major phases of his career and life.But if you  know a bit about Kaufman going in, you won't find much more.  It's a  surface-skimming flip-chart of the major events of his life.  Kaufman's  TAXI experience unfolds in a few short scenes, with the actors from that  show mostly wasted.  I'm not sure the all of them even get to speak.  Granted, MAN ON THE MOON is not the ""TAXI Story"", but TAXI was a hugely  important part of Kaufman's very short life.  In fact, he didn't live much  past the cancellation of  TAXI, and didn't have too much of a career before  it.  To skim over it is to avoid understanding him.  Likewise, his  SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE and LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN experiences are  rushed.  We get no sense of how important he was to those two shows, nor  why his outrageous later behavior on them would cause such consternation.  We're just shown Carrey replaying the most famous incidents on those shows.  And in at least one regard, the portrayal of SNL events is flatly  inaccurate.  Lorne Michaels didn't preside over the vote to kick Kaufman  off the show; that was Dick Ebersol's job.What's unfortunate about  the structure of the movie is that, although it's largely just a replaying  of Kaufman's most outrageous acts, there's just enough background material  to keep us from experiencing those moments as did the original audience.  A  good example is Tony Clifton.  We don't get angry at Tony Clifton, because  we know it's all a joke.  That takes Andy's edge off, and diminishes  the  moment.  To be sure, at some point, MAN ON THE MOON would've had to reveal  Clifton's identity, but I'm not sure we needed to know at the outset.For me, MAN ON THE MOON was just too much sequential shorthand.  It  needed to be more labyrinthine, like Kaufman's own mind.  I wanted more  set-up and more sleight-of-hand so that I could truly feel Kaufman's comedy  anew.  It's as if the filmmakers forgot that celluloid persists.  Fifty  years from now, a lot of this movie won't make sense to first-time viewers,  because everything is told with a wink and a nod to the knowing.  In my  view, the movie should have been made as if the audience didn't know  ANYTHING about American comedy of the 1970s and 80s, and certainly as if  they didn't know a thing about Andy Kaufman.  The writers would then have  been forced to start with the man and move to the comedy, instead of  starting with the comedy and trying to explain the man.It's fascinating  to me that an acclaimed foreign-born director like Milos Forman would've  effectively written off the overseas market by making a film that just  wallows in its own culture-specific in-jokes.  If you don't know something  about American culture, you're going to have problems understanding large  parts of this film.Oddly, the most satisfying parts of the movie are  those which aren't the best-known parts of his life.  Time is taken to  explain the story of his failed special, and we really get to know  something about the way his mind worked as we see him put it together.  Yet  the far more important parts of his life, at least in terms of time devoted  to them, never get anything like the same kind of storytelling care.None  of this is to say it's really a bad movie.  It's worth seeing, and it will  leave you affected.  You'll wonder about the border between comedy and  reality for days after seeing this film.  But I doubt this film will serve  subsequent generations as a definitive work about Kaufman, nor will it rank  even among the better films of Milos Forman's career.[DVD Notes: A  reasonable collection of extra features make this worth purchasing in the  DVD format.  The documentary and `spotlight on location' features are  particularly worthwhile, though the absence of director commentary borders  on unforgivable.  Also, the deleted scenes aren't particularly noteworthy,  and no rationale is given for their deletion.]",3,Great acting in an average film about an extraordinary life,964224000,"07 22, 2000",2000,4305,"['introduction', 'life', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'MAN', 'ON', 'THE', 'MOON', 'well', 'enough', 'most', 'American', 'viewers', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'performance', 'Kaufman', 'friends', 'family', 'have', 'said', 'watching', 'psychic', 'channel', 'spirit', 'Kaufman', 'Carrey', 'resemblance', 'Kaufman', 'positively', 'spooky', 'know', 'nothing', 'Kaufman', ""'ll"", 'come', 'away', 'film', 'sense', 'major', 'phases', 'career', 'life.But', 'know', 'bit', 'Kaufman', 'going', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'more', 'surface-skimming', 'flip-chart', 'major', 'events', 'life', 'Kaufman', 'TAXI', 'experience', 'unfolds', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'actors', 'show', 'mostly', 'wasted', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'even', 'get', 'speak', 'Granted', 'MAN', 'ON', 'THE', 'MOON', 'not', 'TAXI', 'Story', 'TAXI', 'was', 'hugely', 'important', 'part', 'Kaufman', 'very', 'short', 'life', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'much', 'cancellation', 'TAXI', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'career', 'skim', 'avoid', 'understanding', 'Likewise', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIVE', 'LATE', 'NIGHT', 'WITH', 'DAVID', 'LETTERMAN', 'experiences', 'are', 'rushed', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'important', 'was', 'two', 'shows', 'why', 'outrageous', 'later', 'behavior', 'would', 'cause', 'such', 'consternation', ""'re"", 'just', 'shown', 'Carrey', 'replaying', 'most', 'famous', 'incidents', 'shows', 'least', 'one', 'regard', 'portrayal', 'SNL', 'events', 'flatly', 'inaccurate', 'Lorne', 'Michaels', 'did', ""n't"", 'preside', 'vote', 'kick', 'Kaufman', 'show', 'was', 'Dick', 'Ebersol', 'job.What', 'unfortunate', 'structure', 'movie', 'largely', 'just', 'replaying', 'Kaufman', 'most', 'outrageous', 'acts', 'just', 'enough', 'background', 'material', 'keep', 'experiencing', 'moments', 'did', 'original', 'audience', 'good', 'example', 'Tony', 'Clifton', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'angry', 'Tony', 'Clifton', 'know', 'joke', 'Andy', 'edge', 'moment', 'be', 'sure', 'point', 'MAN', 'ON', 'THE', 'MOON', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'reveal', 'Clifton', 'identity', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'needed', 'know', 'outset.For', 'MAN', 'ON', 'THE', 'MOON', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'sequential', 'shorthand', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'labyrinthine', 'Kaufman', 'own', 'mind', 'wanted', 'more', 'set-up', 'more', 'sleight-of-hand', 'could', 'truly', 'feel', 'Kaufman', 'comedy', 'anew', 'filmmakers', 'forgot', 'celluloid', 'persists', 'Fifty', 'years', 'now', 'lot', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'first-time', 'viewers', 'everything', 'told', 'wink', 'nod', 'knowing', 'view', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'ANYTHING', 'American', 'comedy', '1970s', '80s', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'thing', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'writers', 'would', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'start', 'man', 'move', 'comedy', 'instead', 'starting', 'comedy', 'trying', 'explain', 'man.It', 'fascinating', 'acclaimed', 'foreign-born', 'director', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'would', ""'ve"", 'effectively', 'written', 'off', 'overseas', 'market', 'making', 'film', 'just', 'own', 'culture-specific', 'in-jokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'something', 'American', 'culture', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'problems', 'understanding', 'large', 'parts', 'film.Oddly', 'most', 'satisfying', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", 'best-known', 'parts', 'life', 'Time', 'taken', 'explain', 'story', 'failed', 'special', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'something', 'way', 'mind', 'worked', 'see', 'put', 'together', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'parts', 'life', 'least', 'terms', 'time', 'devoted', 'never', 'get', 'anything', 'same', 'kind', 'storytelling', 'care.None', 'say', 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'will', 'leave', 'affected', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'border', 'comedy', 'reality', 'days', 'seeing', 'film', 'doubt', 'film', 'will', 'serve', 'subsequent', 'generations', 'definitive', 'work', 'Kaufman', 'will', 'rank', 'even', 'better', 'films', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'career', '[', 'DVD', 'Notes', 'reasonable', 'collection', 'extra', 'features', 'make', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'format', 'documentary', 'spotlight', 'location', 'features', 'are', 'particularly', 'worthwhile', 'absence', 'director', 'commentary', 'borders', 'unforgivable', 'Also', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'rationale', 'given', 'deletion', ']']",Man on the Moon VHS
70184,AS9J0WAKEKZ5M,0783241313,Walter Grimace,"[5, 6]","Before I watched this movie, I did not know who Andy Kaufman was. I hadn't known that he had appeared on Saturday Night Live ( indeed, I didn't know much about SNL ) and I hadn't known *anything* about Taxi. So I walked into this movie with a wide open mind. Whatever impressions I have of Kaufman now were made by this film. And I love this movie. Absolutely adore it. It's incredible. Kaufman is difficult to understand. I don't, few have, and few will. I don't think he knew himself at all, and I think he was as surprised as everyone else by Tony Clifton and Kaufman's various other antics. The movie itself is deeply moving. Jim Carrey disappears into the role ( making some wonder if, long after faking his death, Andy Kaufman appeared in this movie as the ultimate daredevil act of defiance ). Man on the Moon is not a comedy. Kaufman's life wasn't a comedy either, and he wasn't really a comedian. He was more like a stuntman, by the looks of it. Throughout his short life Kaufman attempted a delicate balancing act, and he would have continued succeeding if he hadn't gotten cancer. That is, if he ever had cancer. To sum up Kaufman's life, I suppose there's one quote I could use, from John Lennon's song, ""I'm So Tired"":""You'd say I'm putting you on/But it's no joke, it's doing me harm/you know I can't sleep/I can't stop my brain/...you know I'd give you everything I've got for a little piece of mind.""",5,A Good Movie About a Troubled Star,1029283200,"08 14, 2002",2002,1416,"['watched', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'was', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'had', 'appeared', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'indeed', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'SNL', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', '*anything*', 'Taxi', 'So', 'walked', 'movie', 'wide', 'open', 'mind', 'impressions', 'have', 'Kaufman', 'now', 'were', 'made', 'film', 'love', 'movie', 'Absolutely', 'incredible', 'Kaufman', 'difficult', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'few', 'have', 'few', 'will', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'knew', 'think', 'was', 'as', 'surprised', 'everyone', 'else', 'Tony', 'Clifton', 'Kaufman', 'various', 'other', 'antics', 'movie', 'deeply', 'moving', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'role', 'making', 'wonder', 'long', 'faking', 'death', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'appeared', 'movie', 'ultimate', 'daredevil', 'act', 'defiance', 'Man', 'Moon', 'not', 'comedy', 'Kaufman', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'comedian', 'was', 'more', 'stuntman', 'looks', 'short', 'life', 'Kaufman', 'attempted', 'delicate', 'balancing', 'act', 'would', 'have', 'continued', 'succeeding', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'cancer', 'ever', 'had', 'cancer', 'sum', 'up', 'Kaufman', 'life', 'suppose', 'one', 'quote', 'could', 'use', 'John', 'Lennon', 'song', ""'m"", 'So', 'Tired', ""'d"", 'say', ""'m"", 'putting', 'on/But', 'joke', 'doing', 'harm/you', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep/I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'brain/', 'know', ""'d"", 'give', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'got', 'little', 'piece', 'mind']",Man on the Moon VHS

Howard Gould ""Video Junkie""","[0, 1]","I grew up watching alot of tv in the 70's, I first noticed Andy Kauffman on Saturday Night Live and later in life as a wrestler.  He died too young before many knew much about him.  His humor like Jim Carrey's could be defined as dry wit or an occasional laugh.  This movie changed my opinion of Jim Carrey; he is very talented; he truly brought Andy to the screen in a magnificent piece of work.  I loved Eternal Sunshine and I loved Man on The Moon.

70186,A1ZQ73CSBW9XOI,0783241313,"""zebisjeb""","[1, 1]","Whether you liked him or hated him, those were your only choices. And that's exactly how Andy wanted it.One of the most original and influential entertainers of our time, Andy Kaufman, believe it or not is still best remembered as Latka of Taxi-fame...to the layman. Although Taxi gave him popularity nationwide, what many people DIDN'T or still DON'T know is that Andy was SO much more. A Behavioral scientist first, infamous put-on artist a close second, Andy didn't tell jokes...he lived them. His antics were so intense, if it wasn't for Bob Zmuda (Andy's writer &amp; best friend) the cat may have still been in the bag. Though Andy died in 1984 of lung cancer, many fans, friends, &amp; family thought he was pulling the ultimate prank. But in all reality, it was the most serious objective of his life. Before Andy's lifestory came to theaters, Zmuda released &quot;Andy Kaufman Revealed&quot;, the book that blew the whistle. Every hoax, every prank, every Kaufmanism, all of it...finally exposed. Though I didn't find the book before I went to the movie, I was already well informed. I was already a fan. Two years before I had even heard news of an Andy movie, I had seen my share of Kaufman TV specials (strongly recommended to take similar steps). Which made my MAN ON THE MOON experience all the better (this translates for all movies, do your homework before you go).  Throughout the film I was in complete awe. Jim Carrey, who portrays Kaufman, shows why he is the $20 mil-a-film actor. Honestly his best work to date. I was in such awe that I actually forgot Jim Carrey was in the film. Maybe because I didn't see Carrey at all, but instead saw Kaufman reborn. A smart move by the movie's bigwigs to hire Carrey, a well known Andy fanatic. Tally up another mark for Carrey under &quot;All-Time Greatest Oscar Snubs&quot; (though he did win a Best Actor/Comedy Golden Globe, even though the movie's a drama..?!). After the movie, my father, my best friend (both big Andy fans), and I were utterly speechless. I'll agree with some people who say that movie may not have shown who Andy really was, but that can only be the fault of the producers. This film could have easily been 3 hours or more, cause what they did show is really only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Andy's career. Also, after I read the book, I realized how much it was missing and how similar the movie's contents were to that of the TV specials I had watched. That's allright though, it made me realize how well Carrey grasped the concept of the double role. Double? Did I mention his dead-on portrayal of lounge singer Tony Clifton, Andy's badguy persona? Actually, it isn't even a double role, for Carrey does many more of Andy's famous characters including an Elvis impersonation. Amazing is all I can muster up. With all that said, this is still a must own for fans of Andy and Jim alike, and especially for the never-believers. As for the DVD, in which I own and was compelled by to purchase a DVD player since at the time I couldn't buy MAN ON THE MOON on VHS, the only thing it's missing is a commentary feature. I would have loved to have heard Jim, Danny DeVito and most of all, Bob Zmuda's take/reaction on Jim's transformation and the overall product. Other features such as Deleted Scenes (you can actually see reasoning in it), two R.E.M. videos (Title song &amp; the Great Beyond), Cast &amp; Crew files (VERY well done/detailed) do fit the bill quite nicely. But personally, my favorites are the Spotlight on Location (The making of MOTM in which it shows Carrey still in character(s) on set) and &quot;Andy Kaufman: This Is HIS Story&quot; which is not only a good read to help fill you in on Andy, but also contains about 10 minutes or so of the Real McCoy in live performances (which you can access by clicking the Andy icon by the This Is HIS Story text when available).  One last suggestion for the Andy newbies. I strongly recommend watching the film before reading the book, for it may ruin some surprises for you or possibly make the movie a disappointment (favorite antics and subjects of importance you thought should have been included).
