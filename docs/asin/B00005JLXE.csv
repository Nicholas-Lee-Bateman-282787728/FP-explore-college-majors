(The same can be said for just about any comic super hero.)It's a great challenge to create a Super Hero movie. The movie must appeal to a wide range of viewers, ranging from those of us who were there in the beginning, to those who've seen the comics in the decades since, and those who've never read the comics.In my opinion, the best super hero movies honor the comic book image of the character. Again, that's not easy if the character has changed over several decades.When I heard about this movie, I was skeptical.Ben Affleck as Daredevil?! Isn't he too thin?!

608104,A13UFZZWOMZA6B,B00005JLXE,,"[10, 18]","I'm not really familiar with comic book superheroes. The only superheroes I can think of I've read about in comic books are SpaceMan Spiff and Stupendous Man from &quot;Calvin and Hobbes.&quot; I never got into Marvel Comics and that whole genre...I only read the funnies. With that in mind, I'm going to try to review the new movie &quot;Dare Devil.&quot; Bear in mind that I know practically nothing about the whole &quot;Dare Devil&quot; comic strip, and I don't know the background or anything like that. I went into the movie as a practically blank slate (except for my predisposition to not liking Ben Affleck).The movie started out sort of interesting, with the opening credits starting out as Braille. I could easily see the irony of watching Braille on the screen as the opening for a movie about a blind man. The movie went downhill from there.I flat out didn't really like this movie. Yes, there were a few funny one-liners that I found amusing but possibly offensive to blind people...but basically everything else about the movie I didn't like. I'll just list the things I didn't like first, and then list the thing(s) I did like so we'll end on a positive note.The dialogue (which reminded me of Spiderman), was horribly cheesy. The acting matched the dialogue (though there were a few good performances mixed in the bunch). I'd have to say that Affleck actually did a half decent job with the character he was given, despite the skin-tight leather outfit he wore.In action movies like this, generally the action is the redeeming part of the movie...the part that makes up for the poor dialogue and plot (I can't complain about the plot...it was based on the comic books...). Unfortunately, in this movie the action seemed to be direct copies of Spiderman...just a different outfit and Dare Devil had to do the same stunts without web...instead he used a cable that he could shoot out and retrieve at will. Basically the action was just your basic fluid CG action that defied gravity...and my attention span. The worst part of the fight scenes was the weird pseudo crucifixion scene in which &quot;Bullseye&quot; (played by Colin Ferrel...the same guy that plays the Detective in Minority Report), gets shot through both hands and stretches out his arm while in a large cathedral. Yeah, it was a little weird.Walking back from the movie, the guy accompanying me (we'll call him &quot;Dan&quot; to allow anonymity) made several remarks on the simplicity of the soundtrack and how it really had no depth. I'm not the music diehard he is, but I agree that the music never really seemed to fit the scene...but the lyrics that I heard seemed to sort of fit (A few lines I caught included &quot;Open your eyes&quot; and &quot;Can't you see&quot; etc). I'd probably have to watch it again and pay more attention to that portion to give any real clues on what that was about (but I'd rather not see it again...).I don't really want to give away the plot...but it does mostly fit into the plot of most superhero movies (good guys vs. bad...), and fits even closer into the plot of Spiderman (I guess Stan Lee wasn't as creative as we thought). Anyhow, I don't really want to complain about the movie anymore, so I'll mention the good point(s).The good points: Ummmm...I thought it was really amusing that Joe Pantoliano played the reporter in the movie. I sort of enjoyed his character (he's Cipher from &quot;The Matrix&quot;). Also...KingPin was sort of interesting...I would never, ever, EVER fight that guy. Man, he was HUGE.

608105,ABOTQXNUBA1MM,B00005JLXE,,"[12, 27]","Great casting and especially great casting as the much underappreciated Michael Clarke Duncan makes Kingpin infinitely better than the doublewide Lex Luthor of Spider-Man&#65533;s John Romita days back in the 1960s.Colin Farrell is terrific as Bullseye; he knows that fans of the book, as few as there are, as well as illiterates who read less than the contents on their Happy Meal box need to see a well-rounded character. He delivers. Jennifer Garner is hot stuff. TV&#65533;s ALIAS chick can kick the [stuffing] out of DD, but in this terrible, terrible condensed cream of comics, Frank Miller (who cameoed in Bullseye&#65533;s bar scene) should have beaten the writers with the stupid stick; there is no character progression for Elektra at all. The character, no fault of Garner&#65533;s excellent look and portrayal, is cut to minutes, not years, of face time. What the [creators] at 20th Century Fox and Regency Films SHOULD have done was to develop her alias alongside of DD from minute one, but they were probably jonesin&#65533; for their own cashcow like Spider-Man.Alas, too many kooks spoil the sloth: lazy writing and too many whacky characters cut this down way, way too much. Superficial and with less depth than a Rolaids commercial, try as I may as an old DD reader, I didn&#65533;t hate it, I was bored by it, and that&#65533;s worse.Ben Affleck looks the part and does a [heck] of a job as Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil, but we never can figure out what exactly he can see and what he can&#65533;t: in the comics, DD could read ink on a page and had sonar-like abilities. Affleck has some of that and none of the other; not his fault, just...a writing team who should have received a remedial course in writing effective narrative. There are so many... unexplained element s...of DD&#65533;s life that we wonder who the nimrod was who thought that this was brilliant... and why.THE CGI was dismal stuff: even a sleepy kid in the back of the theater could have caught the same Daredevil moves twice, and they pretty much [stunk]: c&#65533;mon guys, not even Jackie Chan can run across buildings like that. And how&#65533;d DD get all of those powers from a can of toxic waste instead of the original truck full of radioactive materials? And how&#65533;d DD get those cool weapons? And if DD really could move like that, he didn&#65533;t get hit much, so how&#65533;d he get all of those scars on his back and only a little shmear around the eyes? The back scars are lifted, that&#65533;s right: [borrowed] from Alex Ross artwork for the book BATMAN: WAR AGAINST CRIME in which we see Bruce Wayne undressing after a night as Batman and we see his scarred back: same scene, different medium.The CGI&#65533;d cityscape is flat. Everybody seems to know that blind Matt is really DD except Foggy Nelson, his law partner.Marvel references: Kevin Smith as a coroner; Stan &#65533;Hairplugs&#65533; Lee as an old guy about to cross the street, Matt&#65533;s boxer dad goes up against John Romita, artist for Marvel&#65533;s best years and Matt goes to trial against a guy named Quesada which is all cute and good for a wink among comic geeks but one too many references to the new &#65533;old boys club.&#65533;Bringing X-Men to the screen worked, so did Spider-Man, but not the Golan-Globus CAPTAIN AMERICA or some of the other quickly-buried comic book adaptations.

But I would agree with other reviews concerning the heroine in the picture. They had a gold mine with her as this character. The part was perfect for this actress. Very few female heroes look totally convincing as butt kickers. But this one blew me away. She really looked as though she could take on any man. It was totally refreshing to see the addition of this character to the story. I was really prepared to be blown away with the rest of the story. The romance was to quick I thought but then I thought this is not really a love story. The chemistry between the 2 was very noticable right from the beginning. Even when he was totally beaten in a fight scene with the main bad guy, the last words she said to him made you believe that she was here to stay. ""NOT"" she comes to his rescue in a very convincing display of martial arts and bravado and is quickly dispatched in a very abrupt untimely end. My whole adrenalin rush just took a nose dive. Why even bring her character into the picture to begin with. They literally had a gold mine with Electra. The perfect compliment to a blind super hero. She had the looks the body the costume of a great female super hero. I saw another Sigourney Weaver emerging in her character.

608107,A23FXW3H8FR789,B00005JLXE,,"[1, 3]","Exceeding all expectations, 'Daredevil' turns out to be a fast-paced shot of popcorn fun, just like any good comic book. The gritty look of Daredevil's world is captured well by the director, Mark Steven Johnson, who also adapted the source material into a tight, streamlined screenplay for both comic fans and generic moviegoers alike. The film doesn't take itself too seriously and at the same time doesn't plant its tongue too firmly in its cheek either.A lot of people have thrown a fit over the casting choices made here. However, everyone turns in fine performances for what the film is - a chop-socky comic book come to life. Some scenes look like they were literally ripped from issues of 'Daredevil' altogether, which isn't a bad thing at all. Ben Affleck serves up a redeeming performance as Daredevil/Matt Murdock, blind lawyer by day, crime-fighting risk-taker by night. He's gifted with heightened senses and a radar-like sight after being blinded by toxic chemicals at a young age. His pain and suffering as well as his sense of justice is well conveyed by Affleck throughout the film. Daredevil's love interest and fellow b-kicker, Elektra, played by Jennifer Garner, gets the least to work with among the lead actors and still manages to make an effective presence on screen. As for the baddies, Colin Farrell hams it up as the eagle-eye sociopath Bullseye, who's hell-bent on pretty much killing anyone he sees. Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin is just fine. Yeah, he's black instead of white like in the books. You know what? Who cares. He does a great job of being a menacing syndicate overlord and his part, although small, blends smoothly with the rest of the film. The rest of the supporting cast all make the movie fun to watch, including camoes by Kevin Smith and Stan Lee.If you come in with the right mindset for a flick like this, you'll come away satisfied. If you're a snobbish nose-thumber or a zealous fanboy with exaggerated expectations, then you'll probably (and predictably) rail on it for being this or that or whatever. There are a few fight scenes with poor editing and shoddy lighting as well as some spots in the movie that are dotted with corny dialogue, but that comes with the territory these days it seems. Those things don't detract too much from the fun of the movie though.Bottom Line: 'Daredevil' is a fun and disposable comic treat that goes down nice and easy without too much discomfort. It's much better than other comic fare such as 'Spawn' or 'Judge Dredd' and on the level with the first 'X-Men' and 'Spider-Man.' Bon Appetit...",3,"A Fun Comic Book Come To Life.

Garner and the original cast and crew.Perhaps a story which tells of Elektra's mysterious life and her training in the East,her involvement with a criminal organization ( If I am not wrong it is called the Tentacle ) ,master/sensei Stick,Kirigi ( the zombie/living dead ninja ),the Beast (from the GRAPHIC NOVEL) , and even the participation of  criminals like Mary Typhoid,Stilts,...could certainly make a good story.The double DVD is filled with documentaries,screen tests,featurettes,3 videoclips,enhanced viewing mode,interviews with the best MARVEL writers,pencilers ,etc... - one of the best DVD sets  ever launched.If you like superheroes,sci-fi,action ,adventure ,then this is the movie for you.I am looking forward to part 2.",5,Nice movie  -  wonderful 2 DVD set  !!!,1066089600,"10 14, 2003",2003,1464,"['15', 'years', 'ago', 'used', 'read', 'MARVEL/DC', 'comic', 'book', 'could', 'buy', 'one', 'favorites', 'was', 'DAREDEVIL.I', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', '3', 'times', 'more', 'watch', 'better', 'think', 'Daredevil', 'incredible', 'stunts', 'fine', 'CG', 'effects.The', 'fights', 'are', 'cool', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'interesting.Some', 'people', 'say', 'FRANK', 'MILLER', 'should', 'have', 'written', 'script', '/', 'directed', 'keep', 'forgetting', 'ROBOCOP', '2', 'amp', '3', 'stories', 'were', 'penned', 'him.I', 'ROBOCOP', 'films', 'whereas', 'critics', 'most', 'movie', 'watchers', 'hate', 'them.So', ""'d"", 'say', 'DAREDEVIL', 'nice', 'film', 'Miller', 'amp', 'MARVEL', 'vision', 'essence', 'was', 'preserved.Ben', 'Affleck', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'come', 'back', 'as', 'well', 'C.', 'Farrell', 'Duncan', 'J.', 'Garner', 'original', 'cast', 'crew.Perhaps', 'story', 'Elektra', 'mysterious', 'life', 'training', 'East', 'involvement', 'criminal', 'organization', 'am', 'not', 'wrong', 'called', 'Tentacle', 'master/sensei', 'Stick', 'Kirigi', 'zombie/living', 'dead', 'ninja', 'Beast', 'GRAPHIC', 'NOVEL', 'even', 'participation', 'criminals', 'Mary', 'Typhoid', 'Stilts', 'could', 'certainly', 'make', 'good', 'story.The', 'double', 'DVD', 'filled', 'documentaries', 'screen', 'tests', 'featurettes,3', 'videoclips', 'enhanced', 'viewing', 'mode', 'interviews', 'best', 'MARVEL', 'writers', 'pencilers', 'etc', 'one', 'best', 'DVD', 'ever', 'launched.If', 'superheroes', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'adventure', 'then', 'movie', 'you.I', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'part', '2']",N/A

Even Lou Ferrigno's Hulk tv series is better.And it's not a small feat. The movie is based (or so it seems) on probably the best comic ever published by Marvel, Daredevil as written and drawn by young Frank Miller and Klaus Janson in the early 80s. But the only thing they kept is the character's names (Daredevil, Elektra, Kingpin, Bullseye, etc). Their aspect, personalities, relationships, and the whole plot itself bears no similarity with its source (so I doubt it was ever the source), and the changes are only for the worse. The movie is just too bad to waste time going into depths about how they transformed a great, dark, violent, ambiguous comic into a floppy, puerile, idiot film. It's just the modern hollywood formula: make everything as simplistic, senseless, edgeless, and infantile as possible. And with this flick they reached bottomless depths of derision.

I know people can't fly like Superman or climb walls like Spider-Man but the scenes with the kid doing all those stunts on the roof was just a little to much stupidity for me to handle,yet some of the action was pretty cool. I definitely liked the fact that they got Michael Clarke Duncan to play King Pin, I couldn't think of anyone else to cast for that role, but some hardcore fans of Daredevil disliked the fact that King Pin was a black guy in the film since all the years king Pin has been white in the comic books and cartoons, but sometimes it's good to have changes.

608121,A3U4VUSBJMR5KP,B00005JLXE,,"[2, 5]","""Daredevil"" is one of the worst movies of 2003.  Despite being based on a very interesting comic character, and following one of the better story arcs in that character's universe, the movie simply fails on just about every level, except for set design and cinematography.  It wasn't even that successful at the box office, which makes this 2-Disc edition that pulls out all the stops so surprising.  FOX does a much better job with this release than Columbia did with ""Spider-Man"", which was a MUCH better film.First, the movie.  Ben Affleck plays Matt Murdoch, blind crusading lawyer by day, superhero crusader in NY's Hell's Kitchen by night.  The movie does a very good job setting up the origin story, and then collapses in it's own bloated storytelling.  See Murdoch was blinded by a freak toxic spill as a boy, which has enhanced his other four senses in such a way that he basically sees better than those with functioning eyes.  He became a lawyer to right the wrongs of the world, apparently, though he's not a prosecutor per se, which would seem ideal for a young man out to see justice done, though the first time we see Matt he appears to be prosecuting a rapist.  Why?  Maybe he moonlights at the DA's when not working at his own Law Firm.  It's a tad confusing.  He even lets up on the rapist in court specifically so he can kill the guy later.  So he's a different hero-he kills people.  (Batman was never supposed to be a killer, by the way).Anyway, one day he and his law partner are eating breakfast when Jennifer Garner walks in.  Matt smells her perfume so he knows she's a hottie, and proceeds to try and find out who she is.  Her name is Elektra, and he father is a big Corporate type.  This is important because dear old dad has ties to the Kingpin, played much too genially by Michael Clarke Duncan.  Kingpin is the source of all crime in New York, sort of like Professor Moriarty was the source of all crime in the world of Sherlock Holmes, only Matt Murdoch is no Holmes, and the Kingpin breaks people in half.  He's connected to Murdoch's past in a way that is so obvious you aren't sure if the filmmakers are trying to be clever and failing, or just being sloppy.  Anyway, Daredevil starts messing around in Kingpin's business, so he calls in Bullseye, an Irish assasin played by talentless Irish actor Colin Farrell who can hit just about any target and has a bulls-eye scar in his forehead.  Colin Farrell must have made some kind of classic deal with the devil, in which he gets to be in a lot of movies, but they all stink, as he in NOT a talented actor but the press loves him.  Anyway, Elektra gets involved through a dumb plot contrivance and becomes an assasin.  All of this leads up to...not much.  As I said before, not a whole lot really takes place in this movie.  It's trying to be about bigger things than action, like love, duty, honor, and justice.These characters do talk alot, which is a mjor mistake when you cast Affleck in the lead.  Garner displays almost none of the charm she has in ""Alias"", or even in her brief but impressive cameo in ""Catch Me If You Can"".  The makeup people have also found a way to make her look unatractive, which I would have thought impossible, but they do.  The talks between Murdoch and Elektra are poorly scipted attempts at serious romance between too hurt souls, and come off as trite.  Colin Farell hams it up enough to keep him from being too annoying.  The biggest waste is Duncan as Kingpin, who is not writen nearly menacing enough and seems more like a genial tough guy than a criminal overlord.The film was written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, a Daredevil fan, he claims, who's only other credit is Simon Birch.  He shows very little action skill here, as even the potentially excellent set pieces he sets up in a church organ are sloppy and he uses CGI effects like a crutch.  Plus, he seems to have given Murdoch powers he never had in the comic, such as flight, or so it appears.  The film does look good and dark, stealing a page from Burton's ""Batman"", who is very similar to Daredevil in motivation, so your eyes may have a good time.  But as a movie, ""Daredevil"" is a resounding disapointment in story, acting, and executuion.The DVD itself is surprisingly excellent, with in depth looks at the creation of various aspects of the film, music videos, some comic-to-screen transfers, and a Jennifer Garner Screen test that lets you see her natural beauty in a way the filmmakers chose to hide for some unkown reason.  Anyway, X2 redeemed FOX's Comic book film hold, so wait for the big edition of that one.

After that, it just seems kind of stupid.* The scene where Matt chases down Elektra, and the two people who had never before met, bust out into a fight in the middle of a park for no apparent reason.* Michael Clarke Duncan looks way too nice to be the Kingpin.There are some other little things that bother me about this movie also.

The direction isn't outstanding, but it's certainly more than competent, and the special effects are quite novel. Ben Affleck, once you get past the personal baggage the actor brings to every role he plays, is an effective Matt Murdock. Jennifer Garner is also strong as Elektra, just please remember to skip that horrid spin-off movie she did. The rest of the cast is an A-list of stars: Colin Farrell, Michael Clarke Duncan, Joe Pantoliano. All are great, and help ground the story emotionally.The problem with Daredevil is that Fox, like with X-Men, fudged the film by cutting out a lot of footage. There's a whole subplot that's missing here, as well as small character moments that give the movie a stronger edge.

608128,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00005JLXE,,"[3, 7]","Mark Steven Johnson's Daredevil is nothing like the great Marvel comic it claims to adapt itself from. This terrible film has characters named after Matt Murdock, Daredevil Bullseye, Elektra and Kingpin but none of the story and spirit of its source material. An incoherent collage of comic book panels come to life, this movie is just for diehard fanboys of the comic only.The movie starts off in a church with DD falling off a rooftop onto the floor then flashes back to the past. I tell ya, when a movie starts off with a flashback that's NEVER a good sign. We see a young Matt Murdock growing up poor in Hell's kitchen. A good kid, he honors his dock worker/former boxer father by doing well in school, He's about to show him a straight A report card, he sees his father roughing up some guys for the mob. Ashamed, he runs away and the last thing he sees is a toxic chemicals spraying him in the face. It actually happened differently in the comics, but you'll just have to pick up a copy of Daredevil # vol.1 no 1 or The Essential Daredevil for those facts.Later on in the hospital (how'd he get there? And how'd we get there) he learns his senses are so enhanced he's about to go crazy from sensory overload. He gets control of himself and-well- this isn't explained to us. After his father is killed by the mob, The movie cuts to years later showing us him in a red suit and mask as Daredevil with no explanation to why he has decided to become a superhero or what motivated him to do so. You know, it would have been very helpful for us to SEE those HELPFUL frames of him dedicating himself to becoming a lawyer as a promise to his Dad, training with his sensei Stick, or working towards the goal in law school, or meeting up with Foggy Nelson in law school like he did in the comics and planning to work together in a law firm then hiring Karen Page. I'd also like to have seen Murdock doing some investigation into his father's murder along the way like he did in the first issue of Daredevil. This would have built up the weak story that goes nowhere.Well, we see finally Daredevil in action. He's chasing down a criminal and fights him in a subway station. After beating him up a train passes through the station causing him sensory overload. DD soon recovers and knocks the guy on the tracks another train (I wish trains came right after each other like that here in the city. It would really be helpful during rush hour) comes by and runs the guy over. That's when I knew this wasn't a real Daredevil movie. Daredevil NEVER KILLS. NEVER.We get some scenes introducing reporter Ben Urich and cops investigating the Daredevil sighting. Urich lights a ""DD"" left on the subway platform. Like any dark brooding hero would leave a highly combustible calling card to go along with the guy who he just murdered. We now see Murdock going to work after attending church Confession. He's at the trial of a rapist. He says something about justice being blind but can see and I start thinking about Ramy Zada and the old Dark Justice TV show. The guy gets off and DD goes after him and kills him. But he's one of kingpin's men. We learn of his murder as Natchios is trying to break away from the mob run by Kingpin. Kingpin enlists Bullseye to kill Natchios. Instead of explaining things we see his daughter Elektra (The first Red-haired pale skinned Greek woman I've ever seen) run into Matt Murdock and Foggy at a coffee shop. Playa tries to get those digits and that leads to a fight in a park. The worst scene in the movie. Just fast-forward through it. A convoluted romance leads to and an invitation to a ball. After meeting up with Elektra, he soon surmises that Natchios is in danger after she leaves abruptly. He suits up as Daredevil. Tell me, how do you get a bulky leather jacket pants, and biker boots under a tux and have it look so neat? As Natchios limo drives off, Bullseye rolls up on his motorbike and goes into action. DD tries to stop the hit, but Bullseye gets his man with DD's own weapon.Blaming DD for her father's death Elektra decides not to go into witness protection-but to become a costumed vigilante. We get some frames of her working out then on her way to going after DD with no build-up. Bullseye just shows up and kills this highly trained fighter in less time it takes to butter some popcorn. There's some drama and DD gets his mask taken off. He puts it back on and then we have our big fight between DD and BE which takes us back to the beginning of the film. The priest takes off his mask then puts it back on and scurries out so the final battle begins. DD kills Bullseye then shows up for his final battle with Kingpin. Beating Kingpin, he decides to have a change of heart and not kill him. Instead, he leaves telling him saying the cops know who he is even though this was never shown to the audience! The movie ends with some soliloquy about being the defender of Hell's kitchen or some nonsense.Mark Steven Johnson's Daredevil fails because of its director's inability to tell a story with pictures. Scenes don't transition into one another; stuff just happens because he wants it to with no clear explanation of why they happen. All of the frames don't come together seamlessly to tell a complete story. I really wish the director of this film had THOUGHT of the general audience of moviegoers instead of pandering to diehard comic book fans. Everyone isn't a comic book fanboy and doesn't know the origin of Daredevil by heart. If you never read the comic you'll never understand this movie. Then again, I've read the comics and I STILL don't understand what this movie was about.Ben Affleck is a horrible Murdock/Daredevil. He only has one facial expression throughout the movie. Jennifer Garner is decent Elektra, but doesn't fit the part She would have been more believable as Natasha Romanov, The Black Widow though. Jon Faverau is a solid Foggy Nelson. Colin Farrell is a dull Bullseye. He gets the crazy part of the character down perfect, but tones things down too much. Bullseye is over the top evil like the Joker, and I didn't get that from him. Michael Clarke Duncan struggles with the Kingpin; I think he could have done more with the role, but the writing wasn't there. Joe Pantliano is a perfect as Ben Urich the reporter.Pass this DullDevil by and pick up one of the better superhero movies like the first Spider-Man, Batman Begins, or The Incredibles.",1,"This ,ovie makes no sense.

This isn't the first movie to feature the character: Daredevil was previously played by Rex Smith (from the short lived TV series STREET HAWK) in the 1991 TVM, TRIAL OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK.Ben Affleck plays Ben Affleck, who is trying to play Matt Murdock: a lawyer, and former Hell's Kitchen resident blinded at age 12 by toxic waste (that happens to fall off a fork-lift) after witnessing  the death of his prize fighter father Jack ""The Devil"" Murdock (David Keith) at the hands of thugs (phew!).As always happens in comic books, this toxic waste may have deprived Matt of his sight; but has heightened his four remaining senses. So of course Matt does what has to be done: He dons a silly costume and becomes a vigilante fighting for the rights of the little people and keeping the city safe from crime.But Matt/Daredevil appears to have met his match when he crosses paths with Wilson Fisk, a.k.a crime boss The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan, who gained 18kgs for the role) and his henchman, Bullseye (A shaven headed Colin Farrell with a bullseye tattooed on his forehead, hence the name).However, Daredevil gains an ally in the karate kicking superbabe Elektra Nachios (ALIAS's Jennifer Garner), daughter of multi-millionaire Nicholas Nachios and together they join forces to try and topple the Kingpin (After she nearly beats the heck out of him, in an admittedly good fight scene). But tailing Matt is tabloid newsman Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano) who is trying to uncover the truth about the urban legend of Daredevil. A weak attempt at adding a subplot.DAREDEVIL steals elements of BATMAN & THE HULK TV show; and when you combine this with a cliched script and a wooden lead, it all adds up to 100+ minutes of wannabe- hip; two- dimensional Hollywood drivel.Good production design is one of DAREDEVIL's few redeeming features; but the movies ""Special Effects"" include a camera tilt of Daredevil's feet splashing in a puddle! What a suspense builder! Even BLOOD FEAST (1963) had visuals superior to this!Also, check out this brilliant dialogue exchange when hero and villain finally meet face to face:Kingpin: ""Daredevil!""Daredevil: ""KINGPIN!!"".Wow.DVD extras include both audio AND text commentaries by the producer and director, and an ""Enhanced viewing mode"" function with a Behind The Scenes featurette narrated by the Visual Effects Supervisor , as well as popup factoids you can watch during the movie.

608136,A1PMDTYRAIPGXW,B00005JLXE,Adam P Boots,"[0, 0]","First of all, I'm a little disappointed with this movie... Scratch that... I was completely disappointed with it...  The Origin was NOT accurate with the comic book, as Daredevil lost his sight saving an old man from a truck in the comic books.  Additionally, his father's name and boxing nickname was &quot;Battling&quot; Jack Murdock, not &quot;the devil.&quot;  Daredevil's nickname came from the neighborhood kids who used to call him that MOCKINGLY because he was such a frightened, timid little kid.Also, there was little to no mention of Karen Page, Daredevil's secretary and original love interest, Elektra wasn't originally murdered because of her father's involvement with the Kingpin, but really because of her own (Bullseye wanted revenge from her for taking his job as Kingpin's #1 assassin).Now, for the positives.  I hate Ben Affleck movies, in general, but his attempt to portray Daredevil was fantastic.  The lighting and mood of the movie were good, and the subtle little items were good, such as the use of Classic Daredevil (and/or marvel) creators as character names in the movie (bendis, mack, quesada, Kirby, etc), and the cameos of Daredevil writers Kevin Smith, Stan &quot;the Man&quot; Lee, and Frank Miller (watch the scene where Bullseye steals a motorcycle, but don't blink... you'll miss him).The other little details are also great... Foggy was cast perfectly, and I'll admit that Jennifer Garner IS good with the Sais, even though I don't think I like her as Elektra.Overall, this movie makes me think they treated it with the &quot;second-tier Spiderman&quot; treatment, in that it's a very similar style of adaptation, and less believable then the Spiderman movie.  I'm not completely disappointed by it (I bought it and haven't put it up for sale on Amazon or Ebay), but wasn't as happy as I could have been (I'm just too much of a purist... I didn't like the Spiderman movie all that much either).

There are always going to be those who complain about one aspect or another that the filmmakers overlooked or that the actor wasn't the right one.In spite of all this, there are a great many things about this film to like. The chemistry between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, for example, is amazing (small wonder in light of the fact they later married). The action sequences are pretty impressive, and Garner's performance was enough to spawn a spinoff.OK, the portrayal of Daredevil's sonar wasn't like it is in the comics... yet, it works for me. It would be rather hard to demonstrate it the same way. But there is at least one place where the movie falls short of the comic. It seems to be a bit confused as to whether it's a comic book movie about a comic book character, or if it's a gritty realistic film about a comic book hero functioning in the real world.  This is most blatantly evident the character Bullseye. The performance is all right, but he doesn't have a costume. He asks for one, but doesn't get one.To be honest, I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to movies. It's been a while since I've seen it, and I ordered this as a part of my collection. It's a good film, not a great one... the films licensed to Marvel Studios will ALWAYS be superior because they have a greater stake in making them quality movies. Part of the reason I purchased it was for my collection, but another is to compare the Marvel character films with the later Marvel Studios films.

What I saw left me unimpressed, and disinclined to buy the DVD.  I caught it on cable the other night, though, and I've got to say that despite the film's many flaws, I enjoyed watching it.The flaws:The first thing that struck me as silly was the scene where Daredevil and Elektra fight in a playground.  Well, the silly thing was that it was Matt Murdock (sans disguise) and Elektra fighting.  I couldn't help but think the man has no clue about what it takes to preserve a secret identity.I also felt that the daredevil costume was poorly tailored.  The mask didn't look right, and the rest of it seemed to bunch up in weird places.  It was distracting.Also, while the action was well choreographed and often creatively shot, the director (or somebody) didn't know when a move or a stance looks right.  When I see Jennifer Garner fight on ""Alias"", she's totally convincing, but here, both she and been Affleck often seemed to be off balance or moving awkwardly.  Better direction or editing could have fixed that.Oh, and the dialogue was kind of weak all around. That's actually pretty forgivable for a comic book movie, but I don't like that it was bad enough to notice.The good stuff:The plot wasn't bad at all, and Ben Affleck did a pretty decent job with the substandard dialogue.  The visual style of the film worked pretty well, and the special effects were solid.  The action choreography and cinematography were solid, too.Plus, hey, it's got Jennifer Garner...

The only blemish is perhaps Jennifer Garner's character. She seemed kinda out of place in nearly every action scene. She did a fine job in the more sentimental scenes though, with feeling but without making it overpowering or sappy.Her story of training under a different master every year is pathetic and the brief woman power non-victim speeches are kinda ridiculous. There's also a brief rage scene where the character seemed all but blind to the situation around her. She serves her purpose rather nicely in the film though, and it had me cheering they had the guts to write the role and the story right.All in all this is a great superhero action flick with a darker side.

But all is not darkness because he also mysteriously inherited a strange ""radar sense"" that enables him to see in a sort of X-ray way because of his newfound ability to convert sound waves into sight.Him and his father vow to fix their relationship and their life, promise to never give up and be fearless, and embark on a journey to perfect themselves and hit the comeback trail--Matt via the books and honing his senses and disciplining his body; his father to enter the ring once more. With Matt by his side, Jack ""the devil"" Murdock makes good on that promise, but a fateful night in the ring changes everything and Matt promises from then on to stick up for those who can't defend themselves and watch out for the long shots like he and his father were.Now, all grown-up, he's a lawyer by day and masked crimefighter by night. His name: Daredevil.And he's not the only one who wants a piece of New York. Crime boss the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) is on the rise, as is his hired goon, Bullseye (Colin Farrell). Adding to matters, Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner)--a shapely martial arts master--has her sites on Daredevil (Ben Affleck) as well, leading us into a battle for New York, for vengeance, and for those who have been a victim of crime.For some reason a lot of people didn't like this movie. I thought it was great. I liked the overall story; the costumes (except Bullseye's); the atmospheric New York City; the sense of darkness Matt Murdock carried within himself; Elektra's close relationship with her father; Foggy Nelson (Jon Favreau) and his being a ""come-with"" guy--very enjoyable. There was a sense of humanity about this version of Daredevil that I was able to relate to on a lot of levels.The fight scenes were nothing short of amazing, especially that barroom brawl where Daredevil clears the room. I remember seeing that in the trailer and just being absolutely stoked.Who cares that Kingpin was black? So what? The dude's one of my favourite actors and it was interesting to see him play the bad guy as he's usually the nice, innocent one, but for some reason people didn't like the character being black in this. It doesn't matter, folks. He did a good job.The whole Matt Murdock-Elektra/Daredevil-Elektra relationship was well-handled, in my opinion, and I particularly enjoyed how those elements intertwined with each other throughout the film.If I was going to criticise a few things--and while I enjoyed Daredevil's gallivanting throughout New York--his spinning jumps and aerial movies were very similar to Spider-Man's (who made his feature film debut the year before Daredevil came out), and some of the stuff Daredevil was able to do was pretty farfetched. I mean, I don't care how awesome you are at acrobatic stuff or if you're more fit than Bruce Lee on his best day, but falling face first toward a window washer's station at lightning speed won't get slowed down by doing a somersault in the air so you could land on your feet. You'd break your legs and die from the impact. But whatever. It's superheroes, so I overlook most of the impossible these guys accomplish. Just goes with the understanding superheroes can do things we can't, whether realistic or not.That's really my only critique. I liked everything else. Wasn't crazy about Bulleye's costume. Would like to have seen him as more of a stealth assassin. I also don't read Daredevil comics so I can't tell you if this is a faithful adaptation or not. I know Daredevil's back story and a bit about some past adventures, but that's about it.I haven't seen the director's cut of this either, so need to get around to doing that.Still a good movie and I'm proud to have it in my superhero movie collection.If you like superhero flicks, you'll like Daredevil.A.P.

608153,A18SLX1JESM0EX,B00005JLXE,A reviewer in Atlanta,"[1, 1]","I used to be a big Daredevil comic book fan.  I probably have books ranging over a period of 10 years, though there are some sparse stretches in there.  I haven't read it in the last few years.  If this movie is any indication as to where Daredevil has gone, I'm glad I didn't waste my money on the comics.In the books, Matt Murdock is a highly-capable, blind lawyer who, much like Clark Kent, is a humble individual.  In the movie, he's cocky, volatile and a show-off with his super-normal abilities.  In the books, he's almost flawless in his Daredevil guise.  In the movie, he's flawed in virtually every aspect, not just demonstrated through his on-screen antics, but by the scars that cover his body.  Makes you wonder how he's survived.  In the books, he's not afraid of commitment and has had several romantic involvements.  In the movie, he apparently just keeps moving between one-night stands.  Never even had a girl over to his place.  In the books, as with most Marvel characters developed in the 60's, he uses violence only to bring criminals to justice.  In the movie, he is judge and juror and uses violence to execute the criminals.  In short, Daredevil and Spiderman were always sort of cut from the same cloth.  But the characters portrayed in the two recent movies couldn't be more different.Now, had this been a Punisher movie or some other comic character, I would've found it quite entertaining.

Some saw this as a .... of SpiderMan, but keep in mind (for those of you that don't know about the comics at all) that HE IS THE CREATOR OF MARVEL.  This was probably his decision anyway.2) Yes, Daredevil is blind but with enhanced abilities as the result of the accident.

I really thought it was.  Sure, the screenplay could've used a bit more tightening, but the film was helmed exceptionally well by Mark Steven Johnson.  The film is dark and brooding, almost like Tim Burton's Batman.  The cast was good, with special notability to Michael Duncan as the Kingpin.I was especially surprised at how close it is to the comic.

608162,A36YGQN7LQZKQU,B00005JLXE,Banjo Benny,"[2, 3]","My brother warned me not to expect much from this movie, so I guess it was about what I expected. Duane Thomas gave an excellent review of the differences between the comic reality and the movie reality, and how stupid were some of the changes made in the movie. Suffice it to say that nearly every change they made led to a vastly inferior product. But there was another flaw that I think is important that I didn't see other people bring up, which is the notion of &quot;compression.&quot; In the original Miller series, the Elektra - Bullseye - Kingpin - Daredevil relationships were built up over about a YEAR of comic issues. There was a LOT of background information given about all the characters before the battle between Elektra and Bullseye, so that when Elektra got killed, it was a really big deal. In the movie, it was like &quot;easy come, easy go!&quot; Or &quot;Elektra, we barely knew ya.&quot; And the best part of the climactic comic issue was that it was told from the point of view of Bullseye, allowing the dark comedy to be played up to its fullest. In contrast, the movie was so rushed in character introduction that we had very little clue about why anyone was acting the way they did. In the comic, the Kingpin is actually a very interesting character. In the movie, he barely makes any sense. Not unlike the closing battle scene between him and Daredevil. It was all just a very amateurish attempt to take one of the great comic book story lines and stuff it into too small of a box. It's unfortunate, because if they had built up to this climax in say the 5th movie, they would have had a real franchise. This is the way the X-men movies are going with the Jean Gray / Phoenix saga. In a couple of years, the movie rendition of X-men #137 is going to knock people's socks off. The movie rendition of Daredevil #181 *should* have knocked people's socks off, but they diluted it with too many other plot lines and inane, made-up stuff like Matt Murdock giving his identity away in front of 30 people.

So of course I had to go see this latest dramatization of one of the Marvel Comics stable of sixties and seventies action heroes, an essential part of that latest twist on the genre, with complex anti-heroes replete with a variety of twisted and tormented pasts, each trying to resolve their inner demons even as they wage a war for truth, justice, and the American way. Well, sort of.The new Daredevil movie remains true to the original comic book concept, but whoever decided on the cast of this project must have being `doing lunch' out in La Jolla that afternoon that they discussed character requirements. Instead, it appears as though someone did a hasty demographic scan of the potential audience for the project and then decided to cram as much eye candy onto the screen as possible by way of the leading roles. Ben Affleck could have phoned in his role, so underplaying it that we're left wondering if perhaps he doesn't suffer from aphasia as well as loss of eyesight here. He looks and acts the part, but seems to be walking through the paces without much enthusiasm of conviction. Ben, phone home! Jennifer Garner, in her first movie since stirring in the runaway TV series, ""Alias"", fills the screen with charisma and sex appeal, but lacks the believable love connection to th Daredevil's alter ego to convince us she digs the guy. And Colin Farrell is so badly over the top as Bullseye that we wonder if he doesn't need a quiet vacation somewhere.Yet with all this said, this is a well-executed action movie, with some terrific and sometimes quite ingenious sequences and knockout fight scenes. The special effects are also well done indeed, and what can only be called the choreography of all this spectacular violence so well punctuates the other scenes, providing such an exciting and eventful rhythm to it that we often forget just how marginal the actors are in executing their roles. Almost...yet the movie works well enough and the actors are now becoming enough of a box office draw that we can expect a sequel or two to pop out of the woodwork in the next movie season or so. This is a good movie, but one that missed an opportunity to be much better had they given Ben Affleck some No-Doze and encouraged Farrell and Garner to restrain themselves a bit.

608167,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00005JLXE,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[0, 0]","Marvel Comics' ""Man Without Fear"" was a moderate box office hit in theaters (no SPIDER-MAN or X-MEN, it performed a bit better than BLADE, and did far better, profit-wise, than the dismal HULK), but it is a natural on video, where it's claustraphobic, dark story seems better suited. The tale of blind lawyer/masked Hell's Kitchen protector Matt Murdock, it gives Ben Affleck his best performance to date (why a mask seems to improve his acting, who knows?), but the film is stolen by Colin Farrell's WAY over-the-top villain, Bullseye, and Jennifer Garner, as the elusive and naturally sexy Elektra. Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin is less successfully realized; while he has the height and bulk for the role, he is far less threatening than he seemed in THE WHOLE NINE YARDS, and his lack of menace makes his final confrontation with DD less impressive than Bullseye's.Just as Spider-Man is Marvel's parallel to DC's purely heroic Superman (meek nice guy with glasses becomes superhero, with elderly adopted guardians; works at a newspaper, and has a 'girlfriend' who prefers the superhero), Daredevil is a superpowered variation to the darker, more justice-driven Batman (his parent's death triggers a need for revenge; the police deny his existence, initially, although a reporter guesses his secret identity; he prowls at night, his goal being to rid the streets of scum and vermin). Both the first BATMAN and DAREDEVIL feature churches, prominently, in climactic scenes (DD's showdown with Bullseye, Batman's with Joker); BATMAN RETURNS and DAREDEVIL both feature leather-clad female ally/adversary/love interests who supposedly 'die' by film's end. The analogies were even more obvious in the original DD comic, in the sixties, when Daredevil's sonar-like senses were the result of intense training, and the technology of the Billyclub he carried, and not the later explanation of being blinded by radioactive chemicals that heightened his senses. The bottom line is, movie critics who complained that DD was just a minor league variation of SPIDER-MAN weren't paying enough attention!The CGI scenes of DAREDEVIL aren't quite as obvious as in SPIDER-MAN, which is a plus (having most of the acrobatics at night helps!), and director Mark Steven Johnson keeps the story moving, never allowing an occasional continuity lapse (Elektra and Matt's playground contest, which is pretty illogical, if Matt's trying to keep his powers secret!) from bringing the film down.All-in-all, DAREDEVIL is a winner, and has me looking forward to both the DD and Elektra sequels being planned!",4,An Enjoyable 'Man Without Fear' Debut!,1059868800,"08 3, 2003",2003,2581,"['Marvel', 'Comics', 'Man', 'Fear', 'was', 'moderate', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'theaters', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'X-MEN', 'performed', 'bit', 'better', 'BLADE', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'profit-wise', 'dismal', 'HULK', 'natural', 'video', 'where', 'claustraphobic', 'dark', 'story', 'better', 'suited', 'tale', 'blind', 'lawyer/masked', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'protector', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'why', 'mask', 'improve', 'acting', 'who', 'film', 'stolen', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'WAY', 'over-the-top', 'villain', 'Bullseye', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'elusive', 'naturally', 'sexy', 'Elektra', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Kingpin', 'less', 'successfully', 'realized', 'height', 'bulk', 'role', 'far', 'less', 'threatening', 'seemed', 'THE', 'WHOLE', 'NINE', 'YARDS', 'lack', 'menace', 'final', 'confrontation', 'DD', 'less', 'impressive', ""Bullseye's.Just"", 'Spider-Man', 'Marvel', 'parallel', 'DC', 'purely', 'heroic', 'Superman', 'meek', 'nice', 'guy', 'glasses', 'becomes', 'superhero', 'elderly', 'adopted', 'guardians', 'newspaper', ""'girlfriend"", 'who', 'superhero', 'Daredevil', 'superpowered', 'variation', 'darker', 'more', 'justice-driven', 'Batman', 'parent', 'death', 'need', 'revenge', 'police', 'deny', 'existence', 'initially', 'reporter', 'secret', 'identity', 'night', 'goal', 'being', 'rid', 'streets', 'scum', 'vermin', 'first', 'BATMAN', 'DAREDEVIL', 'feature', 'churches', 'prominently', 'climactic', 'scenes', 'DD', 'showdown', 'Bullseye', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'BATMAN', 'RETURNS', 'DAREDEVIL', 'feature', 'leather-clad', 'female', 'ally/adversary/love', 'interests', 'who', 'supposedly', ""'die"", 'film', 'end', 'analogies', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'obvious', 'original', 'DD', 'comic', 'sixties', 'when', 'Daredevil', 'sonar-like', 'senses', 'were', 'result', 'intense', 'training', 'technology', 'Billyclub', 'carried', 'not', 'later', 'explanation', 'being', 'blinded', 'radioactive', 'chemicals', 'heightened', 'senses', 'bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'critics', 'who', 'complained', 'DD', 'was', 'just', 'minor', 'league', 'variation', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'were', ""n't"", 'paying', 'enough', 'attention', 'CGI', 'scenes', 'DAREDEVIL', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'obvious', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'plus', 'having', 'most', 'acrobatics', 'night', 'director', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'story', 'moving', 'never', 'allowing', 'occasional', 'continuity', 'lapse', 'Elektra', 'Matt', 'playground', 'contest', 'pretty', 'illogical', 'Matt', 'trying', 'keep', 'powers', 'secret', 'bringing', 'film', 'down.All-in-all', 'DAREDEVIL', 'winner', 'looking', 'forward', 'DD', 'Elektra', 'sequels', 'being', 'planned']",N/A

I liked that the characters had the ability to receive visible, even brutal injuries because it forces them to remain grounded in reality.  The villians are another strong point.  Colin Farrel steals every scene with over the top charisma and hilarious facial expressions, while Michael Clark Duncan just has the perfect head bad guy &quot;look&quot; about him.  Another cool part is a rather innovative first kiss between Daredevil and Electra that comes together as a genuine and unique moment in an otherwise mundane script.The Bad:The film seems choppy at times, and all of the interesting characters are wasted as the movie doesn't seem to have much time for development.  The script is little more than &quot;servicable,&quot; which means that conversations are frequently bland.  The main problem here is that of the title character, Ben Affleck.  He has been on and off in other movies, but here it seems like facial expressions and any kind of emotive acting has been thrown out in favor of a performance without substance and feeling.  When I think of Daredevil, I think of of three major characteristics that Affleck doesnt appear to have.  One is athletic ability.  Tobey Maguire became toned and muscular for Spiderman.  Here, Affleck looks to be surrounded by droopy putty with no muscular definition at all.  Secondly, the Daredevil character is supposed to have an intense drive.  Affleck exudes a passive, take things as they come vibe, and his expressions are usually vacant.

I did however catch the directors cut, and it was a little better ........ I said a little.Problem number one - casting Ben Affleck in the lead role for any movie is a bad decision. But the casting of a great supporting cast including Colin Farrell, Jennifer Garner, Joe Pantoliano, and Michael Clark Duncan, more than makes up for that mistake.Problem number two - The amazing ability of anyone in a fight scene to do unbeleivable acrobatic moves. Daredevil was given powers, Bullseye may have had special powers (his character wasn't really explored), but Electra (Garner) was a normal everyday human. When she ""lept a building in a single bound"", I felt that the movie had just taken a dramatic turn for the worse.The positive aspect of this film? The storyline was good and easily followed (except the mystery behind the most intersting character - Bullseye). The acting was solid. The special effects were good, they didn't go overboard (George Lucas, are you listening?).

608172,A18QA3A3UYWFU9,B00005JLXE,Blade,"[8, 8]","First, I have to admit that I simply HATED the theatrical cut of ""Daredevil"", despite some of the well executed CGI effects and action sequences. To begin, there was hardly ANY character development and lastly, there were plenty of plot holes thrown in here and there. In addition, some scenes felt a bit rushed and/or out of place (e.g. the love scene between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner) as if not much thought [or detail] had been put into them! However, after getting a chance to see the long rumored Director's Cut of the film, I decided to give it a second chance. The result: I wasn't disappointed! Unlike the original PG-13 release back in 2003, this is the R rated version that director, Mark Steven Johnson had originally envisioned, but didn't get the chance to make at the time. But now, we can see an adaptation, which is a lot more faithful to the original Marvel comic series created by Stan Lee (who also made ""Spider-Man"") and Bill Everrett. Yes, this version is LONGER, DARKER, and BETTER THAN EVER!!Ben Affleck plays the role of Matt Murdock who becomes blind after experiencing a freak accident as a child. He grows up in Hell's Kitchen, New York to become a lawyer and of course, the ""Man without Fear"" himself: DAREDEVIL! Using an inner radar-like sensor and superhuman strength, he defends the innocent of the Big Apple from dangerous criminals in all shapes and sizes. Eventually, he meets up with the beautiful assassin, Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) and together, they battle the forces of the bone crushing, Kingpin (excellently done by talented Michael Clarke-Duncan) and the ruthless Bullseye (Colin Farrell)! But will they be enough to bring down these two awesome villains?There is over 30 minutes of never-before-seen footage in this DVD release not shown in theaters, including some extended footage with Matt and his father, Jack Murdock, a humorous court scene with Coolio, and a longer, more intense fight sequence between Daredevil and the Kingpin! There are many others that I haven't listed here, but most importantly, there IS plenty of character development this time around! Other features include: a Full-Length Audio Commentary by Writer/Director Mark Steven Johnson and Producer Avi Arad and the featurette, ""Giving the Devil His Due"", which gives us a BTS look at the making of ""Daredevil"" (Director's Cut)! The movie itself is presented in 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.

608173,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005JLXE,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 3]","'Daredevil',`Fantastic Four', and `Spiderman' make a very interesting trio of superhero movies, especially as they are, all three of them, based on a Marvel Comics character. To my mind, they exemplify the three levels of quality of `watchable' superhero movies, as opposed to those that are derivative and lacking any spark of imagination.Although many have rated it fairly well, I would put the newest, `Fantastic Four' at the bottom of the list, along with `Hellboy', which I happened to like, but which shares with `Fantastic Four' some serious difficulties to our suspending disbelief. These movies are simply made for fun. You can almost sense the tongue in cheek attitude of the writer and director, let alone the actors. The situation which creates the superpowers is simply too improbable to accept. How is it that a single physical phenomenon would have five totally different effects on five normal, healthy humans? I know just enough about genetics to know how this may be explained, but the film narrative touches on none of this. We are just meant to swallow this story whole. In contrast, the transformation of Matt Murdock is totally plausible. Enhanced senses following loosing one sense are very real. They just posited a bit more than normal ability in that direction. The genesis of Peter Parker's superpowers is a bit more sci fi, but totally believable, given the chance to believe a genetically enhanced spider species.`Daredevil' is probably the least popular of these three movies, and the first time I watched it, it didn't do much for me. On second watching, especially with the extras on the DVD, I appreciated that the moviemakers really accomplished something here. The premise behind both hero and villains is totally plausible and the director, special effects crew, and actors increase this verisimilitude by using very few CGI effects and stunt doubles. Most of what you see on the screen is really Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and Colin Farrell, enhanced with a few wires to accomplish some of the more adventuresome gymnastics. The filmmakers also enhance the picture by doing a lot of the key scenes at night. This is totally logical, as the sightless Daredevil would have the advantage when his sighted rivals would be almost as visually handicapped as he is. `Daredevil' also has the added value of at least three very human relationships. Along with some of the `Batman' and `Superman' flicks, this holds the penultimate spot in superhero quality films.`Spiderman' is easily on the top tier of superhero movies, based not only on the believability of the premise and the humanity of the actors, but also on the relatively effortless special effects, lightly applied to great effect. I also think the actors contribute much to the quality of this film, where with Toby McGuire, there seems to have been just a bit of casting against type, the way Michael Keaton was cast as Batman in the first Tim Burton `Batman'. While I never read `DareDevil' or `Hellboy' comic books, I am familiar with the original `Fantastic Four' and `Spiderman' comics, so I think the relative merit of the films has a lot to do with the relative merit of the comics, since `Spiderman' is the traditional champion among strong comic book fans. I should add a plug for performances by Michael Chiklis in `Fantastic Four' for his comic relief and by Ben Affleck in `DareDevil' for taking the role so seriously, possibly through the influence of his good buddy, Kevin Smith, who appears in a cameo role as the medical examiner.",4,Excellent Treatment of Comic Book Material.

608177,A3OXJB66H8LU8C,B00005JLXE,Bradford Fritz,"[1, 1]","Boasting an all-star cast, killer soundtrack, an amazing DVD, Daredevil truly delivers on all cylinders here.Ben Affleck plays Matt Murdock, a man who was blinded in an accident as a child, and because of this incident, his other senses adapted and grew stronger than sight. By day, he is a lawyer in a business with college friend Foggy Nelson (Jon Favreau); by night, he is a vigilante seeking justice through any means--the Man Without Fear, Daredevil. Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano) is a reporter who is seeking the scoop on Daredevil, and believes he is not just a New York urban legend, but a true vigilante. Matt's life changes when Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner, the hottest actress on Earth), steps into his life, becoming Matt's girlfriend. Unfortunately, Elektra's father has just stepped out of connections with the crimelord Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), and Kingpin hires an Irish assassin with perfect aim, Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to kill Mr. Natchios. This all leads to chaos, and when things go awry Matt and Elektra must seek justice in their own ways, against the evil Bullseye and Kingpin.Bringing to life another of Stan Lee's fantastic Marvel Comics creations, Daredevil is an amazing movie with a good score by Graeme Ravell (The Negotiator) and soundtrack with such bands as Fuel, Drowning Pool featuring Rob Zombie, and Evanescence (this movie really got them off the ground).The only thing I have to fret is casting Duncan as the Kingpin. Nothing against Mr. Duncan or black people, but the Kingpin is a huge, hulking Caucasian man, fat, not muscular. They should've kept it that way. But I thought he played the part given to perfection. Garner, of Alias fame, is also amazing as Elektra and may be one of the best parts of the movie alone.The action scenes are also tremendous, and the &quot;radar&quot; Daredevil possesses is greatly brought to screen.The impressive 2-disc DVD collection brings the picture quality in 2.35:1, and audio soundtracks in Dolby Digital 5.1 &amp; DTS 5.1, both amazing soundtracks.

And the tone of the movie is perfectly rendered - dark and romantic, but never the depths of despair or too real.  Melodrama - reality with all the boring parts taken out!  That was Frank Miller's motto and that is what you get here.  Ben Affleck turns in a romantic and vioent turn as Matt Murdock, the first blind superhero in the Marvel universe.  And despite stunt celebrity casting somehow the rest of the cast is well matched.  Jennifer Garner does not have the Greek look or even the red costume of Elektra, but she can kick the [stuff] out of anybody and still look beautiful doing it.  Michael Clark Duncan plays Kingpin, and despite the white version found in the comics ... he's more than perfect.  And Collin Farrell as Bullseye is a joy to watch! The movie may try to move too quickly over so much territory, and sometimes it seems rushed.  But I was relieved to realize it was one hour and forty minutes, and not the bloated 2 hour plus running time of most comic book movies.  This is one the girls can get behind too, because Elektra is beautiful and deadly and the equal of any fighter in the movie.  It's fun, it's entertaining, and it moves like a runaway train!  What more can you ask for?Well... the DVD is tricked out with more features than you can imagine!  Two discs, commentary, documentaries, text commentary, behind the scenes branching, music videos, making of the movie and the history of the COMIC!  Each documentary runs as long or longer than the movie!  It's powerfully well done by Fox who always sets the bar and raises it.  There are Easter Eggs with outtakes, interviews with everyone down to the woman who sewed the coat for Bullseye.  Even if you find fault with the movie, you can't critize the DvD.  It's what dreams are made of.  And that's why I give it 5 stars!",5,If you buy one comic book movie on DVD ...

608179,AWNKEM8DAG8PY,B00005JLXE,Brian Conway,"[2, 4]","When Daredevil originally came out in theatres in 2003, it seemed like a mere plot by Marvel to cash in on the success of Spider-Man and act as a buffer until the release of Spider-Man 2. How fitting that Daredevil be thrown onto the silver screen and receive little critical acclaim and much dislike from fans--reactions to the Daredevil comic books were very similar for the longest time, with people complaining that his character was simply a Spider-Man knock off. The 2003 theatrical release of Daredevil was a simplistic, fast-paced action flick complete with generic grunge-metal soundtrack made for the sole purpose of raking in cash from curious teenagers. The director's cut, however, is a completely different affair. A whole subplot was introduced in this version (featuring Coolio's character on trial for the murder of a prostitute) along with extended scenes and fights which greatly added to the depth of the characters, gave the film a few more laughs, and gave a look into what Daredevil was really about when Frank Miller came in and rewrote his character in the early 1980s. As a result of these edits, Bullseye and the Kingpin come off as a lot more menacing and Matt and Elektra's love affair isn't nearly as shallow as it was in the PG-13 version. The reason Daredevil failed so miserably upon its release in theatres never made sense before considering how director Mark Steven Johnson loved the source material and just what he had to do to let Avi Arad give him the job: it was the PG-13 restriction that became the undoing of Daredevil and the 30 minutes of additional footage, along with an appropriate R rating, reveal the director's cut of Daredevil to be a far more interesting and accurate take on the classic story arcs--in short, it's the way Daredevil was meant to be.",4,Daredevil: Director's Cut (2003) (3.5 Stars),1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,1803,"['When', 'Daredevil', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'theatres', '2003', 'seemed', 'mere', 'plot', 'Marvel', 'cash', 'success', 'Spider-Man', 'act', 'buffer', 'release', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'How', 'fitting', 'Daredevil', 'be', 'thrown', 'silver', 'screen', 'receive', 'little', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'much', 'dislike', 'fans', 'reactions', 'Daredevil', 'comic', 'books', 'were', 'very', 'similar', 'longest', 'time', 'people', 'complaining', 'character', 'was', 'simply', 'Spider-Man', 'knock', '2003', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Daredevil', 'was', 'simplistic', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'flick', 'complete', 'generic', 'grunge-metal', 'soundtrack', 'made', 'sole', 'purpose', 'raking', 'cash', 'curious', 'teenagers', 'director', 'cut', 'however', 'completely', 'different', 'affair', 'whole', 'subplot', 'was', 'introduced', 'version', 'featuring', 'Coolio', 'character', 'trial', 'murder', 'prostitute', 'extended', 'scenes', 'fights', 'greatly', 'added', 'depth', 'characters', 'gave', 'film', 'few', 'more', 'laughs', 'gave', 'look', 'what', 'Daredevil', 'was', 'really', 'when', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'came', 'rewrote', 'character', 'early', '1980s', 'result', 'edits', 'Bullseye', 'Kingpin', 'come', 'off', 'lot', 'more', 'menacing', 'Matt', 'Elektra', 'love', 'affair', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'shallow', 'was', 'PG-13', 'version', 'reason', 'Daredevil', 'failed', 'so', 'miserably', 'release', 'theatres', 'never', 'made', 'sense', 'considering', 'how', 'director', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'loved', 'source', 'material', 'just', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'let', 'Avi', 'Arad', 'give', 'job', 'was', 'PG-13', 'restriction', 'became', 'undoing', 'Daredevil', '30', 'minutes', 'additional', 'footage', 'appropriate', 'R', 'rating', 'reveal', 'director', 'cut', 'Daredevil', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'accurate', 'take', 'classic', 'story', 'arcs', 'short', 'way', 'Daredevil', 'was', 'meant', 'be']",N/A

Despite that, it's a solid little movie.  It never soars, and it stumbles on a few occasions, but at the end it emerges as well worth the time.  My main comlaint would be that the movie is too short; it could have been, and probably should have been, a half hour longer.  That way, there might have been a bit more time for real characterization.  As is, the characters just sort of move from one scene to the next, and we are expected to sort of fill in the blanks for ourselves.  That the characters manage to live and breathe at all is a real testament to some fine acting.  Ben Affleck, whom I expected to suck in this role, is outstanding as the conflicted title hero; Jennifer Garner shows Elektra's soft side as well as her angry, vengeful side; Michael Clarke Duncan is largely wasted as the Kingpin, but is believable as a crime lord; and Colin Farrell is truly psychotic as Bullseye, although I'd like to have some idea of why he is so nuts.  Another complaint I'd like to register is that some of the wirework and CGI is awful.  On the other hand, some of it is very good.The extras are pretty good.  There are two nearly hour-long documentaries.  My favorite was the one that focuses on the comic-book history and development of Daredevil.

It wasn't that Mark Steven Johnson wasn't loyal to it or just made a bad movie, but it was the relative mediocrity/obscurity of the Daredevil comic book.

In fact, Mark Steven Johnson set up many of the movie's scenes to look exactly like panels from the comic.

Unfortunately, like the comic book, the movie is now experiencing obscurity.  Did you ever wonder why you'd never heard about the Daredevil sueprhero?  Well, now you know after seeing this movie.

Fortunately however, Fox Studios were smart enough to release the Director's real Daredevil vision. Originally, I had little interest in this edition as well. DC (Director's Cut) or no DC, Daredevil was just a plain bad movie, I thought. But then, as the weeks passed after its release, and I was barraged with positive remarks and outright raves for the DC, I decided to give it a go. And 2+ hours later, I was certainly glad I did.But first, before I move onto the more positive points of the movie, let me start with the bad, which is, rather simply, any damned scene with Daredevil in it. This may seem quite odd. How can a movie be successful when it's title character is the largest detriment to the film? I'm not quite sure of it myself.Affleck just doesn't cut it in costume and during action sequences. The wirework is also quite hokey, the fight choreography is second-rate, and even the cinematography and lighting of the scenes look cheap and B-Movie-ish (in a bad way). All in all, a quite bad addition to any film. Thankfully, Daredevil the film is hardly about Daredevil the man. Rather, it's about a guy called Matt Murdock. And, in this area, the film works splendidly.We start with My Biggest Complaint AKA Daredevil, but we quickly flash back to Matt as a child, and the events that would lead up to him being given his power and his decision to use it. This part of the film is maybe my favorite. Scott Terra who plays Young Matt is solid in performance, as is David Keith who plays Matt's ex-boxer father Jack. This act of the film is heartfelt and enjoyable, and both Keith and Terra work well together as father and son.After this good-sized origin, we are flashed forward to Matt Murdock and Daredevil in the present. We get glimpses of Daredevil fighting crime, and Murdock also fighting crime. Albeit as a lie-detecting lawyer instead of a leather-glad demon. While, as I said previously, Daredevil leaves much to be desired, the characterization of Murdock, simply put, it quite excellent. Shame, all of that is, basically, flushed down the train by casting Ben Affleck in the roll. To be kind, all I'll say is, I've never been a fan of Affleck's, and his performance in DD hasn't changed my opinion of him one bit. I WANT to understand Matt, I WANT to like him, and I sort of do, but with Affleck in the roll, the character is hurt greatly. In any case, during this time we're also introduced to the supporting cast. Matt's tubby partner in law Foggy (Jon Favreau), the beautiful (and dangerous) Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), as well as the slightly-pesky New York Post reporter Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano). Garner is forgettable as Elektra (how E ever got a spin-off movie, I'll never know), and her entire subplot as a burgeoning superhero is rather lame and out of place with the rest of the film. Foggy is, well, fun. But, despite having been based on a comic-born character, he just seems to harken back to the comical supporters in other superhero movies such as Knox in Batman or Otis in Superman: The Movie. Urich's roll is strong, but slight. This supporting cast is, sadly, more than a bit weak, and they do hurt the film slightly. As a supporting cast, they hold together pretty well, and, at worst, they're ""watchable."" Affleck however, is a much different story, sadly...The villains are both introduced rather late. And, sadly, have little screen time. They are Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Bullseye (Colin Ferrell). Duncan does an extremely good job of bring the formidable comic villain of Kingpin to the screen. While the character lacks some of the sophistication of its comic book counterpart, Duncan lifts it above that bit of poor writing, and really makes Kingpin a menacing and enjoyable villain to watch. However, as I said, his screen time is slim, and that damages the development of the character to great extent sadly. Ferrell also does a strong job of bringing his character to the screen. But in a slightly different way. He hams it up. A lot. His walk and movements are greatly exaggerated movements of forced Bravado and Cool. He's trying so hard...and you can tell. But, amazingly, this bit of ridiculousness doesn't hurt the character much, but rather gives him very comic-booky feel. Something that's lacking from most adapted villains. It's not a great show, but it's fun. As with Kingpin though, Bullseye's character development is almost non-existent.The direction overall, I found to be a bit mediocre. MSJ's vision seems lacking in both cinematographic value and storytelling expertise. Making it bluntly obvious Daredevil is not blockbuster material. But for the small-scale film it is, and as a fair adaptation of its character, Daredevil succeeds rather well.As stated previously, the fights are all rather unimpressive, the CGI-enhanced areas of the film are all poorly done, as well, and the final ""showdowns"" with Bullseye and Kingpin are, at best, hokey. At worst, they're horrible. But, luckily, the film isn't about that. The fights, the villains, or even the supporting cast. It's about Matt Murdock, and his life, his struggle. And in this area, Daredevil shines.6/10",3,A Much Improved Director's Cut,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,5403,"['thankfully', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'many', 'see', 'Theatrical', 'Cut',

608190,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B00005JLXE,Chrijeff,"[1, 1]","Daredevil, the Man Without Fear, should probably be described as one of Marvel's lesser superheroes; at least, nobody has yet penned a Complete Guide to him, as they have to Spiderman, X-Men, and the Fantastic Four, who have also been given filmic incarnations.  And on the whole, so far, I think their versions are better than his.  DD, like Spiderman, calls New York his hunting ground, and like Spidey he is perceived as a vigilante.  But when DD is ""at work,"" he's all business--there's no humor or lightness to what he does at all, and unlike Spidey, he often sets out specifically to kill those he sees as transgressors against justice.  His motivations are to some extent understandable--his alter ego, Matt Murdock, is an attorney whose father, a boxer trying for a comeback, was murdered on the night of his great triumph, and Matt himself, as a boy, was often a target for bullies--and even laudable to anyone who has grumbled about people ""getting off on technicalities"" or ""beating the system.""  And, as is shown in an early courtroom system, Matt's superpowers, which include greatly enhanced hearing, serve him as a kind of biological lie detector: when an accused rapist claims on the stand that his victim ""enjoyed it,"" Matt knows by the rate of his heartbeat that he's lying.  Still, this is a very dark, violent film, and not one that I could really enjoy.  To be sure it has its moments: the early flashback to Matt's boyhood, showing his strong bond with his father, how he got his powers, and how he began to train them; the beautifully choreographed ""fight"" between Matt and the love of his life, Electra Nathios, on the day they meet; Daredevil's heart-stopping leaps from New York's towering buildings.  And villain Bullseye is a very creepy psycho--just the kind of person you don't want to meet in a dark alley.  At the end, though, I found myself wondering about questions that weren't addressed.  How did an orphaned kid from a poor neighborhood find the money to go to college and law school?  Why and when did Matt/Daredevil confide in his local priest regarding his secret identity?  How does an attorney whose partner gripes (good-humoredly) about their heavy load of pro bono cases afford Matt's sleek, high-tech, almost Fortress-of-Solitude-ish apartment?  Why, when he wants to go to sleep (as opposed to sleeping *with* somebody), does he submerge himself in what appears to be a coffin filled with water?  How did Matt explain the wound drilled through his shoulder by Electra's sai?  Any of these questions could have been answered very simply with a line or two of dialogue.  It's the business of a movie to make its ""world"" real to its viewers, to be plausible within the parameters of the universe it's set in; if it's fantasy, that's one thing, but the Marvel movies are supposed to take place in a reality only a step or two sideways from our own.  When the filmmakers don't seem to care enough about their reality to ""make it real,"" they spoil the movie for me.

It has Romance, Drama and Action all rolled into one Fun movie.Daredevil is a story about Matt Murdock, an attorney by day and a masked superhero by night. When he was twelve he got into an accident with hazardous chemicals that took away his sight, but in return gave him a maximum level of superhuman strength, which helps him to bring justice to anyone who has been a criminal of injustice.I was really surprised to see Ben Affleck be a superhero, since he doesn't fit the role of one, but after seeing the movie, he brings the character to life with great dramatic and action persona. Jeniffer Garner is a scene stealer and looking very hot, as the tough and sexy Electra, who is Matt Murdock's love interest. Michael Clarke Dunkan is great as The Kingpin who also fights in the movie, which I didn't expect; and Colin Farrel as Bullseye is perfect, bringing in that Irish toughnest that he has to his great character, which is very cool to see.Honestly, I haven't heard of a superhero called Daredevil, until the movie arrived. I didn't get a chance to see it in theatres, but I'm sure it would have been amazing, but it was still a treat for me to see it on DVD, with all of the 'daring' extras.The movie is great in giving us a background on Murdock's life from when he was a young boy to his accident up to his present day life as a blind man in New York City. Everything in this movie is cool especially when we see the Shadow World scenes. It was a great technique that I haven't seen before and it just adds a great visual feast for the eyes.Another thing to point out is the soundtrack, it was AMAZING, particularly the songs. There are songs in the film that adds a great storytelling techinque between what the characters are really feeling inside without even talking. It will really get your emotions. Very well used.Daredevil, isn't that bad. It's not better than X-Men, X2 or Spider-Man but it is worth your while.

In this pic, the Daredevil is a mild-mannered attorney by day, crimefighter by night, who leaps and soars and pirouettes with the greatest of ease despite the fact that he's blind. In this film, our hero decides to pick a fight with the local crime syndicate's kingpin, and the ensuing battle of good v. evil plays out to it's predictable conclusion, with lots of leaping about rooftops and breaking of glass [and you have to have the obligatory sharp cocktail party along the way, where all the characters, good and evil, dress up and insult each other while maintaining good manners]. The visuals relating to the way in which the Daredevil ""sees"" the world around him [using his acute, overly attuned other senses to create images in his mind] are really fabulously done. That's the high point of the film. The low point is Affleck, who is stiff as a board and inexcusably hollow. His co-stars are a little more useful - Jennifer Garner certainly is nice to look at, and Colin Farrell seems to be having more fun than anyone as the weasly assassin Bullseye - but they can't make up for Affleck's non-compelling lead. Whereas the original comic books deal with complex, paradoxical characters - superhuman on the outside, fragile on the inside - directors of these big-budget flics seem to be way, way, WAY too interested in special effects and style, and almost any film where style trumps substance is bound to be mediocre, at best.

Not to mention that it has one of the best villains to grace the screen for the past decade in the form of Bullseye who is brilliantly played by Colin Farrell. Farrell just seems to be having so much fun with the role. You want him to get what he has coming but at the same time he's so much fun to watch.Anyone who hasn't seen DAREDEVIL should definitely give it a look no matter what their reservations may be. Director Mark Steven Johnson has done an amazing job. I've seen a lot of movies this year (of all types and genre) and DAREDEVIL still stands out as one of the best. I can't wait for the sequel.

608195,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,B00005JLXE,CodeMaster Talon,"[1, 1]","What's interesting about many Hollywood films today is that while the technical competence may be there, they often lack those little details that can make film-going such a rewarding experience. That's what makes ""Daredevil"" so unusual; it's exactly the opposite. Both the filmmaking and storytelling here are at times stupefyingly sloppy, and yet every once in a while there will be a small moment that really and truly works. For those of you who haven't yet seen it, here's the breakdown:THE PLOT: Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) is a blind attorney by day, but by night he avenges evil in the seedy Hell's Kitchen district as ""Daredevil"", a violent, red-suited version of a guardian angel. Murdock battles the elusive Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan) and his henchman Bullseye (Colin Farell) while romancing Elektra (Jennifer Garner), a greek beauty who just happens to blame Daredevil for her father's death.THE GOOD: Poor Bennifer. The dude gets no respect nowadays. He can be proud of his performance here though; he's quite good. Portraying a blind man convincingly can't be easy, but Affleck is always believable even when the script has him doing things distinctly out of the realm of the visually challenged. Jennifer Garner also aquits herself well as his love interest/sparring partner, and Colin Farrell manages to make his Bullseye at once menacing and a wee bit sexy. Some of the special effects are also a cut above, particularly the manner in which Daredevil's ability to ""see"" is rendered. Very cool guys.THE BAD: The continuity. Oh man, the continuity. Horrendous. Huge plot holes, many things that flat out do not make sense at all (such as the ""Crouching Tiger""-style floating around from characters who DO NOT HAVE THIS POWER) and character development that ranges from okay (Daredevil) to slight (Elektra) to almost non-existent (their relationship).THE KIND OF ICKY: The violence. It got to be a bit much. This is not a kid's film, that's for sure. People get sliced, diced, snapped, lacerated, dropped from great heights and chopped in two. I realize that many people do not mind this, but this movie should really not have been PG13. Consider yourself warned.As I said at the outset, the only redeeming aspects of ""Daredevil"" are the small moments. A scene during a rainy funeral that echoes an earlier moment atop a roof, a section detailing the homelife of Daredevil (can't be easy to get beat up night after night) and a nifty moment involving Bullseye and a broken pane of glass. In the end though, it just wasn't enough for me. I give this movie 2.5 stars, which I decided to round down to 2 instead of up to 3. There's a better movie trapped inside here; I hope the filmmakers get their act together for the sequel.

608196,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005JLXE,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[1, 1]","When I saw this movie in the theaters, it didn't impress me as much as I wanted it to, but seeing it again, it's starting to grow on me.  While having a few issues with the movie, I think it was fairly well done.  Being an avid comic book reader in my youth, I was very familiar with the characters, so I did have preconceptions of how I thought the movie should have been, and maybe that was the problem.The movie tells the story of Matt Murdock, a blind, idealistic lawyer who does a leather outfit and seeks justice at night, played by Ben Affleck.  As a young boy, Matt is blinded in an accident by biohazardous material, but his four remaining senses are subsequently augmented to superhuman levels.  This includes hypersensitive hearing to the point where he can visualize sound waves reflecting off objects allowing him to 'see'.  We also learn how his father, a professional boxer by trade, was murdered because he refused to participate in a fixed fight by taking a fall.  This sets up Matt's motivation for becoming a superhero of sorts, using his special abilities to help those who can't help themselves, both in and out of court.After all this origin stuff is laid out for us, we fast forward to the present, where we see Matt in court involved in a case against a particularly nasty sort of fellow who manages to get acquitted of a rape/abuse charge.  Later that night, Matt dons his outfit, and begins to seek his own justice against this fellow.We also get to meet Matt's future love interest, Elektra, played by Jennifer Garner.  We find out her father is involved with a major crime syndicate run by Carlton Fisk a.k.a Kingpin, played by the ever enormous Michael Clarke (The Green Mile).  Her father wants out of the business, to which the Kingpin decides to set him up for a fall and make it look like Elektra's father is really the Kingpin.  Fisk calls in a hire assassin, Bullseye, played by a baldheaded Colin Farrell.  He goes after Elektra's father, and ends up getting into an altercation with Daredevil.  During their fight, Bullseye manages to kill Elektra's father and make it look like Daredevil was responsible, so this sets up a fight between Elektra and Daredevil.  I don't want to go further into the story than I already have as not to spoil anything, but, as you can probably guess, Daredevil and Bullseye end up having a climatic fight at the end of the movie.  Oh yeah, and Kingpin gets his due, also.There were some major and minor differences between the comic book and the movie.  The biggest was Kingpin.  In the comic book, he's a fat, bald white guy while in the movie he's a large, muscular black guy.  Was this a good or bad change?  It didn't make a big difference to me, but I didn't feel like Michael Clarke's character could have been the head of a major organized crime syndicate.  Ben Affleck played his role well, but his performance always seemed a little off the mark.  He just didn't seem to really get into the character to me, like a puzzle piece that doesn't quite fit.  Jennifer Gardner was probably the best in this movie, as she seemed to really fit in with the character I remember from the comic, although the comic book Elektra had black hair and seemed a little more ethnic in her Greek background.  And her fight with Bullseye...what was up with that?  She was an expertly trained fighter, and Bullseye's main ability was to be able to turn almost any object into a deadly weapon by way of being able to throw it and always hit his mark.  In the comic, he was not an amazing fighter, but in the movie he was able to hold his own against Elektra and Daredevil.  Whatever....Colin Farrell did all right, but just didn't seem right in the part.  And that bullseye brand on his fore head...man, that was goofy.  Also some of the music just didn't seem to fit the scenes...like the scenes were filmed to fit the music, and not the other way around.I guess if you liked Spider-man, then you will probably like this movie, as the formula is the same, but the chemistry just doesn't seem to work like it did in Spider-man.  This movie is a little darker, and doesn't have the whimsical element of Spider-man, but it seems to try and stay true to the comic book, which I appreciated.As far as extras go, there are tons.  Like 8 hours worth.  There are some extras on the first disc along with the movie, and then the whole second disc is all more extras.  One extra I thought was pretty cool was the running visual commentary, like the old Pop Up video show on VH1.  There is also an enhanced audio track for the visually impaired, of which I am not really sure what it is, but reminded me of that Python bit on the Holy Grail movie where they had a guy shouting things for the hearing impaired.Oh yeah, once the movie ends and the credits roll, keep watching as there is a bit more of the movie about half way through the credits.  I missed it in the theaters, but caught it here.  It's worth it.",4,Justice is blind.

608197,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B00005JLXE,Craig Connell,"[0, 0]","First off, this was a more complete version of the DVD which came out earlier. In this edition, about a half-hour of new material was added to the disc (and what was shown at the theaters.) Most reviews I read said it elevated this film from ""fair at best"" to ""good."" I agree. It made the movie much, much better.Yeah, it's more far-fetched than the other superhero movies because here, the hero is a blind guy who, because of his blindness, has extraordinary hearing powers along with the rest of the usual Batman/Spiderman-type athletic skills.As in most of the Batman films, this is a dark film. I think it would have been better had it lightened up a bit with a few jokes and a more wholesome female lead. Jennifer Garner is another one of these latter-day skinny chicks who is made to be tough-looking, tough-talking and tough-fighting.However, I will say she comes across a little more likable on the extended version. One more negative: the fight scenes go on a tad too long and are outlandish.On the positive side, this may be the best-sounding DVD I own, at least up to ones I had heard up until this came out in January of 2005. Since the hero (Ben Affleck) has super hearing, this is emphasized in this movie and so you, if you have a 5.1 surround system, hear sounds from all speakers at almost times. It's awesome!Affleck, meanwhile, is likable as the superhero and I liked the message he gives at the end about shunning revenge. Wow, you don't hear that much in movies. Kudos, too, to villains' Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. They are fun to watch, especially Farrell.So, if this superhero film interests you, make sure you get the ""Director's Cut"" edition.

608198,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JLXE,Craig Matteson,"[4, 5]","Daredevil is a more satisfying comics based action movie than I had expected.  Like all Marvel heroes, he is troubled and battles his internal demons as much as he fights the bad guys (in fact, they all have more success with the bad guys than their personal problems).  This movie has a pervasive sense of loss even greater than Spiderman or Hulk.Ben Affleck is pretty good as the sightless hero who aches over his murdered father (very well played by David Keith).  Jennifer Garner is beautiful and athletic - a fine choice for Elektra Natchios.  The rain effects that allow Daredevil (Murdock / Affleck) to ""see"" her are neat and touching (although one does wonder why wind currents wouldn't do the same thing).I also enjoyed Colin Farrel as Bullseye and Michael Clark Duncan as The Kingpin.  It does seem to me that the whole conflict with Kingpin is a bit underdone.  The big fight in the movie is with Bullseye, but he is just a paid assassin.  Daredevil has an even greater reason to hate Kingpin and yet that fight is fairly simple and over in a few minutes.Jon Favreau is terrific as Murdock's law partner and comic foil and Derrick O'Connor adds a lot as Murdock's priest, confessor, and father figure.  Joe Pantoliano is always good, and here he plays the smart reporter who is trying to figure Daredevil out.  Good acting.

I've watched the trailer and read some reviews about it, but because it was another comic book story turned into a movie, I didn't have much anticipation of seeing it. Also, I really liked Spiderman, and in my mind, I figured Daredevil would just be another copy cat image of that success, and not do it very well either. I was so wrong; Daredevil is pretty close to being just as good as Spiderman.I appreciated the look of the movie, how we saw what Daredevil was seeing. It was a very imaginative and interesting concept, especially during the rain sequences. Daredevil is also much darker and more intense with violence and death.So, on a final note, I will not have to be dared to go and see the sequel.

608201,A26VNYTGSFO9EU,B00005JLXE,Dave Fernandes,"[0, 1]",I have a greater appreciation for the difficulties in dealing with Hollywood.  The director's cut is a significant improvement over the theatrical release which I found one of the worst superhero films ever made.  Ben Afleck is a disaster as an actor and the plot was not even there.  This release restores to audiences what was meant to be seen in the first place.  It's a much better representation of the darkness of Daredevil.  One of my favorite parts of DD was Matt Murdock and he becomes a real character in it.  We see him live his life and feel the difficulties of being who he is.  I highly recommend this release of the film.,4,significant improvement.,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,636,"['have', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'difficulties', 'dealing', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'cut', 'significant', 'improvement', 'theatrical', 'release', 'found', 'one', 'worst', 'superhero', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Ben', 'Afleck', 'disaster', 'actor', 'plot', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'there', 'release', 'audiences', 'what', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'first', 'place', 'much', 'better', 'representation', 'darkness', 'Daredevil', 'One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'DD', 'was', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'real', 'character', 'see', 'live', 'life', 'feel', 'difficulties', 'being', 'who', 'highly', 'recommend', 'release', 'film']",N/A

I liked the dark and gothic view of Daredevil rather than the chipper happy Marvel induced Daredevil. I liked how they added the tale of the BULLSEYE vs. ELECTRA bit in this film from issue #181 of Daredevil comics. And to go off track for a sec...... Spiderman stinked to me. It wasn't dark, had hardly any action, the movie mistakes were easily spottiable and it was too happy. And Daredevil had no movie mistakes, more action and a rather decent plot. The only complaint is that the action needed to be a bit more stylish (hence MATRIX or BLADE).Some (or alot) of people seem to dislike this film cuz they either hate BEN AFFLECK or the Daredevil movie was not like the comics at all. Well WAKE UP! This is the 21 CENTURY! Me and alot of others want anti-heroes and darker and cooler movies. Not happy crap! If you want happy movies, watch BLACK & WHITE FILMS. So this is a good film.

Thus I do not have much to say about this movie from that perspective. However I can tell a bad film from a good one. And this one was pretty bad.First of all, nothing in this movie lasts long enough for anyone to enjoy it. Longest part of the movie is a fight between DD and Bullseye and it lasts about 1- minutes. I don't know what the rush was, but every scene of this movie was over before I had a chance to get into it.Second, these days with all the technology available one would think that visual effects would have been better. It was not all-together bad, but difference between computer-generated character and a real person is just too obvious and fight scenes are pretty ....Third, filmmakers seem to concentrate on DD's inability (or ability) to see little too much. For the most part we all see everything the way DD does. And although visually it was pretty cool, there was no reason why we had to watch half the movie as if we were blind.....All and all, I do not recommend rushing to theaters to see it.

When the movie came out in 2003, I was basically pleased with the outcome.  Affleck is passable as the blind lawyer with superhuman senses.  The chemistry with Jennifer Garner's character, Elektra, works.  Good supporting performances from Joe Pantoliano and Jon Favreau, though Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin and Colin Farrell's Bullseye are both over the top, especially the latter.  The soundtrack is kicking, headlined by a couple of well-placed songs by up-and-coming (at that time) Goth band, Evanescence.  The special effects need some help in places, most noticeably the fight scene between Daredevil and Bullseye in the church, which is almost cartoonish.  All in all, it was a worthwhile movie.  Not the greatest superhero movie of all time, but worth watching.When the Director's Cut version appeared, I was interested.  It contains 21 additional minutes of footage, along with a number of special features.  Sadly, the longer version was disappointing to me.  It makes the film darker and grittier, but also slows it down.  The quality of the blu-ray transfer is fine, and the sound seems okay as well.

608211,A3S7WU6DIH71CC,B00005JLXE,Denny Vu Quach,"[1, 2]","This is a great movie. Affleck is added to the 'Marvel's comic superheroes list'. Okay so it isn't 'Tow towers' or even 'X-men' but it's still good. You'd think Ben Affleck was a rather odd actor to play a role of a superhero but he actually played it really well. SO is it entertaining? Yes, it is. It's worth it. The fight sequences are fascinating (not exactly the final X-men movie battle though where all the characters reveal their best powers to us). It is funny too. But the main question people ask themselves when a movie like this is made is that is the character true to the original idea? The X-men were perfect, the Archie comic cartoons weren't exactly right, Spider-man was good, Asterix and Obelix was good, Lord of the rings/Two towers was also perfect, and the Harry Potter flicks were also excellent. And so did Daredevil. It was just like the comic. It's important to have some huge fan of the original creation to make the movie a success. In Spiderman's case it was the director and in Daredevil's case it's Ben Affleck. But Affleck and Garner didn't exactly form a great onscreen bond. It may be hard to have that in a superhero flick but 'Jean Grey-Cyclops' and 'Peter Parker-Mary Jane' didn't really have trouble doing that. But the bottom line is that true fans will probably be pleased with this creation. From all the comic book superhero flicks being made, X-men is (hands down) the best of them all. Every character was perfectly chosen, more than I can say of other superhero movies. The movie is in short sinister and an action-packed adventure.The story revolves around Matt Murdock (played by Affleck) who was blinded as a child by a radioactive accident. But he got great senses, excellent fighting abilities, and other superhuman powers. In the morning he is Kitchen defence attorney. At night he is known to many as 'Daredevil' a superhero that fights crime in the streets of New York (common to all superhero comics/movies except Batman). He leaps from skyscraper to skyscraper. Daredevil's opponent Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), and his deputy-murderer Bullseye (Colin Farrell) also play major roles of difficulty in Affleck's life. Daredevil fights their prevailing forces unaided, until he meets Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner of ALIAS fame), a trained martial artist and super heroine who is after Bullseye and Kingpin for assassinating her dad.Actually overall the movie is pretty good but there aren't really any 'phrases' and 'scenes' that you would start mentioning over and over again. I mean unforgettable stuff like the way Uma Thurman says 'Poissssson Ivyyy&quot; in Batman and Robin or the way Robin always said 'let's get to the bat mobile' etc. But you can't have it all. You can't just wait for X-men 2 to come out without watching other superhero flicks. Well you can but it's a bit of a wait so I recommend you see this!Rating out of 5: 4.5 so I rounded it up to 5Best scene: When Matt and Elecktra fight eachotherWhat's the best thing about it? It stayed true to it's comic book!Worst thing? The cast wasn't all that great. Compared to other comic book movies, it was a lowdown. The casting should have been done by the X-men casting person. The movie (X-men)was so perfect that you actually felt like you were reading the comic books, watching the cartoons, or playing the games! --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title",5,Don't mess with this guy!,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,3419,"['great', 'movie', 'Affleck', 'added', ""'Marvel"", 'comic', 'superheroes', 'list', 'Okay', ""n't"", ""'Tow"", 'towers', 'even', 'X-men', 'still', 'good', ""'d"", 'think', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'was', 'rather', 'odd', 'actor', 'play', 'role', 'superhero', 'actually', 'played', 'really', 'well', 'SO', 'entertaining', 'Yes', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'fascinating', 'not', 'exactly', 'final', 'X-men', 'movie', 'battle', 'where', 'characters', 'reveal', 'best', 'powers', 'funny', 'too', 'main', 'question', 'people', 'ask', 'when', 'movie', 'made', 'character', 'true', 'original', 'idea', 'X-men', 'were', 'perfect', 'Archie', 'comic', 'cartoons', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'right', 'Spider-man', 'was', 'good', 'Asterix', 'Obelix', 'was', 'good', 'Lord', 'rings/Two', 'towers', 'was', 'also', 'perfect', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'flicks', 'were', 'also', 'excellent', 'so', 'did', 'Daredevil', 'was', 'just', 'comic', 'important', 'have', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'creation', 'make', 'movie', 'success', 'Spiderman', 'case', 'was', 'director', 'Daredevil', 'case', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Affleck', 'Garner', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'form', 'great', 'onscreen', 'bond', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'have', 'superhero', 'flick', ""'Jean"", 'Grey-Cyclops', 'Parker-Mary', 'Jane', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'trouble', 'doing', 'bottom', 'line', 'true', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'pleased', 'creation', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'flicks', 'being', 'made', 'X-men', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'Every', 'character', 'was', 'perfectly', 'chosen', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'other', 'superhero', 'movies', 'movie', 'short', 'sinister', 'action-packed', 'adventure.The', 'story', 'around', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'played', 'Affleck', 'who', 'was', 'blinded', 'child', 'radioactive', 'accident', 'got', 'great', 'senses', 'excellent', 'fighting', 'abilities', 'other', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'morning', 'Kitchen', 'defence', 'attorney', 'night', 'known', 'many', ""'Daredevil"", 'superhero', 'fights', 'crime', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'common', 'superhero', 'comics/movies', 'Batman', 'skyscraper', 'skyscraper', 'Daredevil', 'opponent', 'Kingpin', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'deputy-murderer', 'Bullseye', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'also', 'play', 'major', 'roles', 'difficulty', 'Affleck', 'life', 'Daredevil', 'fights', 'prevailing', 'forces', 'unaided', 'Elektra', 'Natchios', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'ALIAS', 'fame', 'trained', 'martial', 'artist', 'super', 'heroine', 'who', 'Bullseye', 'Kingpin', 'assassinating', 'dad.Actually', 'overall', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', ""'phrases"", ""'scenes"", 'would', 'start', 'mentioning', 'over', 'again', 'mean', 'unforgettable', 'stuff', 'way', 'Uma', 'Thurman', ""'Poissssson"", 'Ivyyy', 'quot', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'way', 'Robin', 'always', 'said', 'get', 'bat', 'mobile', 'etc', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'wait', 'X-men', '2', 'come', 'out', 'watching', 'other', 'superhero', 'flicks', 'can', 'bit', 'wait', 'so', 'recommend', 'see', 'Rating', '5', '4.5', 'rounded', '5Best', 'scene', 'When', 'Matt', 'Elecktra', 'fight', 'eachotherWhat', 'best', 'thing', 'stayed', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'Worst', 'thing', 'cast', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'Compared', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'was', 'lowdown', 'casting', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'X-men', 'casting', 'person', 'movie', 'X-men', 'was', 'so', 'perfect', 'actually', 'felt', 'were', 'reading', 'comic', 'books', 'watching', 'cartoons', 'playing', 'games', 'text', 'out', 'print', 'unavailable', 'edition', 'title']",N/A

Ben Affleck plays Matt/DD very well he actually surpised me with his performance. The film has a dark tone and isn't all colorful like Spider Man was. Colin Farrel and Micheal Clarke Duncan as the villians do good jobs but Colin steals the show as Bullseye. In my opinion Farrel did one of best comic book villain jobs since Jack as The Joker. When it comes to Jenifer Garner as Elerkta she did a good job she's sexy as always.

608215,A3QEJ40NQEW36Q,B00005JLXE,"Desired FX ""Call me Don. It's shorter than Is...","[0, 1]","If the entire run of Daredevil comics is viewed as a grocery store, this movie consists of a shopping trip where the sweetest, juiciest offerings are snapped up and tossed into the cart with little regard for how they will complement each other.Everybody in the movie does a pretty good job, and you get a sense that this film was made by people who really liked the character and wanted to make the coolest Daredevil movie possible. Very little of the origin story is changed, and the loss of the heroic feat that resulted in young Matt Murdock's blindness is quickly compensated for by the good boy behavior he exhibits as he learns to make his way in a dark world of overwhelming sounds, smells, touches, and tastes.Most people probably don't notice that 3/4 of the movie is a flashback--the ""life passing before my eyes"" framework is quickly forgotten as we're captivated by Matt's tragic tale. I really would have preferred the sort of origin story that Miller presented in the comics series when Ben Urich discovered Daredevil's identity, but this approach was serviceable.And that's my real problem with the movie: the highlights are great--special moments that any DD fan will be familiar with--but they're pasted together with a lot of ""serviceable"" material that just barely bridges the gaps.The casting is solid, but not incredible. Colin Farrell is great as Bullseye, Jon Favreau is an ideal Foggy Nelson, and Joe Pantoliano does nicely with a not-very-special version of Ben Urich. Ben Affleck is, well, serviceable, and Jennifer Garner, while delightful to look at, is sadly miscast as Elektra Natchios, who was always depicted in the comics as much more mysterious and exotic: Garner's just too whitebread for the role. Michael Clarke Duncan seems to have taken the spirit of the Kingpin to heart, but his clumsy handling of almost every prop they put in his hands (and he's always holding something) makes this great, mountainous, powerful figure look a bit hesitant and shaky.A lot of this movie works very, very well, and there are some magnificent moments that are right up there with the best the movie superhero genre has to offer. Overall, though, it doesn't quite hold together. A notch below X-MEN, two notches below SPIDER-MAN, but, fortunately, good enough to wash away the taste of the wretched ""Trial of the Incredible Hulk,"" which introduced Daredevil to TV audiences back in the 80s.Hm.

I have never seen any film that so many want to be rid of at one time.  Alright, the main problem, and this carries on throughout the story, is that I expected Morpheus and Neo and Trinity from ""The Matrix"" to show up at any moment.  Or, at least, to see Batman go flying by overhead and pausing ever so slightly to cover the Moon.  Where o' where did Daredevil's super-abilities come from?  Okay, for the sake of comic book fantasy I can buy into a blind superhero with the ability of echo-location.  It makes for some interesting and often cool special effects shots mixing sound and visual action.  But at no point does it make clear why he can suddenly jump off a building, fall for ten stories, then bounce athletically from scaffolding to scaffolding until he lands without a scratch.  By the end of the film Daredevil is jumping from rooftop to rooftop, across four-lane streets!  Also, there are so many moments that rip off ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" that this film is really nothing more than another contrived superhero flick.  Also, contrary to my earlier statement which involved specific special effects, most of the other effects are horrible, looking more like computer game characters battling one another, then editing in close-ups of the character's faces.  It all makes for some surreal continuity and requires a serious suspension of disbelief.

It's filled with moments that could never happen in reality so it's not a good film. I don't agree. It's a superhero movie and super-hero movies are never strictly realistic. Don't watch this type of movie if you want strict realism. You'd be better off not watching movies at all. Superman has been fooling people with a pair glasses for 70 years. It's classic stuff, and entertaining, but it doesn't make any sense from a strictly realistic perspective. And what about that scene in Batman Returns when Batman punches a hole in the floor of his armored Batmobile with his fist? He's just got human strength! Spiderman has super strength and yet Doc Ock has no problem taking his punches? And there's just no way MJ's hair would blow like that when the taxi cab crashes through the window but IT'S A COMIC BOOK MOVIE not a physics class. Comic book movies are filled with this sort of stuff. Trashing Daredevil, a comic book movie, for not being realistic is just plain foolish. Daredevil if an entertaining superhero movie and the director's cut is an even better version for fans of the film.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 2]","I can't believe I'm writing this:  I enjoyed this movie.I normally don't get into comic book plots about superheroes.  The &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; movies convinced me to stay further away.  As to the Incredible Hulk, if I want to see a giant green man I'll pick up a can of peas.  So with great trepidation, wailing, and gnashing of teeth (all six of them) I sat down and watched this DVD.Knock me over with a feather.  DAREDEVIL entertained the daylights out of me.  From the predictable set-up of the story, to the rock 'em sock 'em action, to the great special effects, to the one-dimensional villains, this movie had me grinning like my cat after the goldfish disappeared.  I like to think the film succeeded because I sensed a tongue-in-cheek satire of all the other superhero yarns that clutter the Marvel Comics playground.  Looked to me like everyone involved with the production of this movie had a good time making it, primarily because no one took themselves too seriously. They just went with the flow, which is what the viewer should do; let the story suspend your stodgy sense of disbelief and take you for a ride with the blind, red leather crime fighter as he frolics and flies around Manhattan's skyscrapers.I can't believe I'm writing this, either.  I actually liked Ben Affleck in this movie.  (But not enough to suffer through &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; again.)  Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan are superb menacing, grimacing, bloodthirsty villains.  And Jennifer Garner adds admirable buns of steel.

It has some of the most atrocious editing I've ever seen. Every death is a joke, and then we're supposed to feel sorry for the lost character. Hell's Kitchen's roughest looking gang seems to be a group of 12 year-olds in the daylight, whoa, tough neighborhood! I think I heard some [...] chirping birds in there! Elektra is gone as soon as she's in the picture, she's the average girl, which is much more boring (but easier for the teen audience to identify with) than a silent assassin. Michael Duncan is barely in the film, hardly set up and the ending battle isn't even a battle. Bullseye is kind of funny, which was their intention. How is Affleck? Kind of passable, actually. He has his smirk and says heroic lines with an unnatural, soft, gruff voice but he doesn't do damage like the director, Mark Steven Johnson. I liked seeing Daredevil come home and spit out broken teeth. The film was shot in such complete darkness that you can't see most of the scenes with clarity. It is dark, but is so thematically chipper and goofy at the same time which detracts from whatever mood that might've had. Foggy Nelson, Matt's assistant was amusing with his alligator comments. Thankfully the cameo from everyone's favourite overrated idiot, Kevin Smith, did not detract from anything, in fact, his cameo had more personality than we got from Matt Murdoch in the entire running length of the film. This is only true to Frank Miller's story in that there are people who die, there is no Stick (Matt trains by punching bags and sliding down rails) and Elektra doesn't even exist like we know her. This is a short, empty film, and if I praise it, I feel like I'm contributing to lower standards. It's a very short kiddie flick, and it should not have been. It has a watered-down Matrix wannabe feel.

I didn't like it much but I have liked the character since I was a kid and enjoyed enough of it to avoid  seeing the whole experience in a poor light.The director's cut of the film fixed a good 50% of the problems I had with the theatrical release. There is around 30 minutes of extra footage involving a subplot that showcases the character of Matt Murdock. This cut also retells the relationship between Elektra and Daredevil and makes it a lot more involving and a lot less gratuitous. The action scenes are extended and more violent and there are even a few more snipets of things you may have missed in the theatrical cut as a fan of the character (like Matt's mom).I still won't give it a perfect score as the scenes that didn't work for me still don't but the director's cut moves the film from an average yet faulty attempt to a legitimate vision of the character.",4,This review is for the Director's Cut,1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,1015,"['first', 'impression', 'Daredevil', 'theater', 'was', 'confused', 'poorly', 'edited', 'yet', 'energetic', 'moody', 'look', 'Daredevil', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'have', 'liked', 'character', 'was', 'kid', 'enjoyed', 'enough', 'avoid', 'seeing', 'whole', 'experience', 'poor', 'light.The', 'director', 'cut', 'film', 'fixed', 'good', '50', '%', 'problems', 'had', 'theatrical', 'release', '30', 'minutes', 'extra', 'footage', 'involving', 'subplot', 'character', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'cut', 'also', 'relationship', 'Elektra', 'Daredevil', 'lot', 'more', 'involving', 'lot', 'less', 'gratuitous', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'extended', 'more', 'violent', 'are', 'even', 'few', 'more', 'snipets', 'things', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'fan', 'character', 'Matt', 'mom', '.I', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'perfect', 'score', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'director', 'cut', 'film', 'average', 'yet', 'faulty', 'attempt', 'legitimate', 'vision', 'character']",N/A

In real life, no true martial artist kicks high. The lower the better. However, in the movies where the bad guys are paid to fall down a la the script, the more fancy and stylish the moves, the better. Notwithstanding all that, I liked the movie. Colin Farrel is great as Bullseye, the lunatic killer who loves to throw lethal objects like Ninja Shaken and other such missiles at people. He is a totally different person from his character in The Recruit where he has a perpetual frown plus 5 o'clock stubble but looks much better. The scene where a young Daredevil puts an end to the school bullies really made my day. A super duper scene! I love too the scene in the plane where Bullseye kills the chatterbox old lady next to him. His weapon of choice, a humble peanut from those small packets the air hostess gives you with your martini. He really stops her inane and boring chatter with a single move.Personally, I really dislike people who talk too much. Jennifer Garner is very good. Muscular, craggy and curvaceous and, she is not beautiful in the classic sense, BUT has that sex appeal or 'je ne sais quoi' as the Frenchies say that most men find completely irresistable. She can kick my butt any time. Her martial arts moves are smooth although it is clear she has no background in the martial arts. The love scenes sizzle! There is a very obvious ""chemical attraction"" between the two lead actors and it shows. A Comic strip hero is brought to life as only Hollywood can do it, complete with computerized special effects. I could do with a cane like Daredevil's cane. It has as many weapons as James Bond's briefcase in ""From Russia With Love"". All hot blooded Daredevil fans must be wondering where they can get one just like it. The movie is so fast and SO exciting, don't see it if you want to sleep after the movie, you might dream of jumping up all over the place and beating up a few dozen baddies with your collapsible cane! The message is the same as in the ""Death Wish"" movies with Charles Bronson, namely, when the law fails, take matters in your own hands and just 'waste' the baddies. Simple and basic. Ah, if only life in the 21st Century were so simple. But there again, what about Iraq? Bush and Blair were real Daredevils there and they did one hell of a job! I'll vote for them anytime.

608226,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B00005JLXE,Duane Thomas,"[18, 24]","Translating an idea between media, i.e. comic book to movie, necessitates changes.  I enjoyed Marvel's X-Men, Spider-Man and Hulk movies; all embody changes from the comics but they were true to the spirit of the originals, and the changes were, in some ways, improvements.  In Daredevil, the changes damage the story line and lessen the character.Comic:  Jack Murdock is a constant moral compass to his son, he never betrays his ideals.  Matt is blinded in his first act of heroism; he races to push a blind man from the path of an on-rushing truck from which falls a radioactive isotope, striking him across the eyes.Movie:  Jack lies to Matt, pretending to be a dockworker; actually he's a bonebreaker for a loan shark.  Discovering his father roughing up a victim, Matt runs away, heartbroken, right into a spray of toxic waste.  Which is more interesting, makes the character more noble, lets us understand how a hero could have been raised by such a father?Comic:  Ben Urich is a tall, gangly chainsmoker, hag-ridden by his commitment to journalistic integrity.Movie:  He's short, artsy, with an effeminate speech pattern, wears his hat backwards and literally looks down his nose at everyone he talks to.Comic:  The Kingpin is a super-Godfather.Movie:  Ditto, but he's black.  Like all Mafia bosses, natch.Comic:  Matt becomes one of the nation's top trial attorneys.Movie:  he can't even convict one of the Kingpin's men of rape, he's not as good as the defense lawyer.  (And how much sense does it make for a private attorney to handle a high profile case against a known organized crime figure?  Can you say:  district attorney?)  He doesn't even charge money, clients pay him in barter.  Which makes the character more impressive?Comic:  The fact Matt is not a normal blind man is his greatest secret.Movie:  After being ""blinded"" he beats up the neighborhood bullies, complete with gymnastics.  You think someone might realize this isn't your typical blind kid?  He does the same thing with Elektra years later.  They do their best to beat each other to a pulp (it's shameless the way they flirt) with dozens of witnesses, engaging in flips, balance beam acts, martial arts moves. Goodbye, secret identity.Comic:  Matt's billy clubs snap together, disguising themselves as his blind man's cane.Movie:  The ""disguised"" cane is inset with raised devil head emblems. &lt;Groan.>  As a direct result of this, Ben Urich realizes Matt is Daredevil.  A police scientist demonstrates how the billy clubs collapse down to a long, thin cane.  (But the police never, then or later, say to themselves, ""You know....this looks a lot like a blind man's cane."")Comic:  Bullseye is a stone-cold costumed assassin.Movie:  Bullseye is a twitchy, undisciplined killer with a scarred forehead and trenchcoat. Bullseye's elegant black-and-white outfit would look great in live action. Why they didn't go for that is beyond me.Comic:  DD's mask is an integral part of the costume.Movie:  It's a pull-on hood, a horribly uncertain method of retention for such an acrobatic hero. But then, if the way the mask affixed wasn't so insecure, Matt couldn't have been unmasked so easily, not once but twice, during the movie.Elektra stabs Matt through the left shoulder, totally penetrating the scapula. Matt drops to the ground in shock, he can barely move.  But later he holds himself on ropes over an abyss (with his left arm), does gymnastics, blocks Bullseye's full-power kicks (with his left arm).  Remember the movie's opening image shows his blood dripping down dozens of feet of church roof and wall.  I can believe a man has super-senses.  It's called magical realism.  You ask me to believe a normal man - and that's what Daredevil is, no super-strength, no Wolverine-type healing factor - can still be up and running, engaging in martial arts battles, hours after having a steel rod punched all the way through his shoulder blade and losing, oh, five pints of blood, that's not magical realism.  That's impossible.Final absurdity:  Matt will kill a rapist but not the Kingpin.  We could debate the morality of the former death.  But when the man who's murdered the only two people you've ever loved is helpless on his knees in front of you, he knows your secret identity, he's saying, ""I'm going to get you,"" you know he means it, if you leave him alive he's going to kill you and/or more people you care about....it's not like he's giving you a whole lot of choice.  But Matt proclaims self-righteously, ""I'm not the bad guy,"" and walks out.  No, you're a moron.  This after throwing Bullseye from a 100-foot tall window and across a street onto a police car, which probably did kill him.  Dumb plot twist.

(i can never spell his name right.)  he anils bullseye to almost perfection.  to me it does not seem like much of a stretch for him to play that type of character considering his personality in real life.  however, i really dont care because i feel that he is one of the best actors to come along in a very long time.  he has charissma to spare and has the acting chops to back it up.  michael clarke duncan does make his presence known, but for a man his size, its hard not to make his presence known.  but any man of size could have played that role, so he does not garner a lot on attention.  like i said, daredevil was good, but the fact that at the end of the movie charcters start jumping distance and scaling walls that are not humanly possible are the only real detractors to the story.  the action is great and the fight scenes are worth going to see the movie or at the very least rent it.  i recommend this movie but not strongly, its good for a friday night watch.  but i am still torn as to whether i will buy it on dvd or not.  who knows.",3,"good, but not spectacular",1052611200,"05 11, 2003",2003,1835,"['comic', 'movies', 'coming', 'out', 'daredevil', 'ranks', 'way', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'really', 'cool', 'moments', 'down', 'side', 'movie', 'far', 'fetched', 'aspects', 'i', 'know', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'have', 'understand', 'characters', 'comic', 'book', 'are', 'human', 'have', 'special', 'mutant', 'powers', 'daredevil', 'enhanced', 'senses', 'make', 'sense', 'blind', 'everyone', 'other', 'senses', 'become', 'keener', 'when', 'one', 'lost', 'story', 'good', 'one', 'interesting', 'elements', 'affleck', 'not', 'disappoint', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'jennifer', 'garner', 'great', 'job', 'elektra', 'shoes', 'very', 'well', 'great', 'presence', 'right', 'attitude', 'role', 'real', 'standout', 'colin', 'farrel', 'i', 'can', 'never', 'spell', 'name', 'right', 'bullseye', 'almost', 'perfection', 'not', 'seem', 'much', 'stretch', 'play', 'type', 'character', 'considering', 'personality', 'real', 'life', 'however', 'i', 'really', 'dont', 'care', 'i', 'feel', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'come', 'along', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'charissma', 'spare', 'acting', 'chops', 'back', 'up', 'michael', 'clarke', 'duncan', 'make', 'presence', 'known', 'man', 'size', 'hard', 'not', 'make', 'presence', 'known', 'man', 'size', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'not', 'garner', 'lot', 'attention', 'i', 'said', 'daredevil', 'was', 'good', 'fact', 'end', 'movie', 'charcters', 'start', 'jumping', 'distance', 'scaling', 'walls', 'are', 'not', 'humanly', 'possible', 'are', 'only', 'real', 'detractors', 'story', 'action', 'great', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'worth', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'very', 'least', 'rent', 'i', 'recommend', 'movie', 'not', 'strongly', 'good', 'friday', 'night', 'watch', 'i', 'am', 'still', 'torn', 'i', 'will', 'buy', 'dvd', 'not', 'who']",N/A

We all remember how the recent Batman series turned into a big joke, and eventually died out about two films too late.  If the same thing happens to the most recent wave of Marvel-character films, it would be a big tragedy.  Some of us have been waiting all of our lives for these characters to be portrayed correctly on screen.Well, with ""Daredevil"", we now have three extra-base hits in a row after ""X-Men"" and ""Spiderman'.  And the scenes to X-Men II look very promising.  An I've got my hopes high that ""The Incredible Hulk"" might even take it to a new level.  The current proprietors of Marvel deserve a standing ovation for insisting that the true spirit, and most of the rules regarding the characters are strictly kept.  In some ways, ""Daredevil"" may be the best of the bunch so far.Possibly the best part of the movie is that it does not dumb it down in any way.  In my opinion, the accelerated dumbing-down of the Batman and Superman movies were the biggest reason they died out.  By taking the attitude that these were basically stories for kids, the greatly underestimated the intelligence of the audiences.The people who have filmed the Marvel heroes have figured out that the people who spent their childhoods with these characters have now grown up.  Yes, there remains a childlike innocence, but there literally are millions of people who take these stories as seriously as anything in movies, and they don't like it when what they like is messed with.  ""Daredevil"" presents a pretty bleak world, where the bad guys seem to win more often than the good guys, and good guys do get killed.  Yes, we know Daredevil will live to fight another day, but he pays a big price along the way.And Ben Affleck is back on my good list again after a decent performance as Jack Ryan, and a perfect one here.

But rest assured, the DVD coming this November will be the R-rated cut, incorporating some twenty minutes of new material to make the movie just over two hours.  The DVD will have a new audio commentary track with the director among others, sport a DTS  soundtrack (sweeeeeeeeeet), and a feature entitled ""The Making of a Director's Cut.""  Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately, for those of you who already bought the first DVD edition) there will be no second disc with bonus features, but that's where the current DVD will still be handy.

608234,A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA,B00005JLXE,Ervin Griffin,"[3, 4]","I have to agree with Mauricio J. Heilbron Jr, MD in that this film gets slammed more than it deserves. While nothing mind blowing, I have to say this story was better than Ang Lee's HULK. My only real knock on it is there was spots that should've been explained like how did Matt Murdock get through school and into college? Where did he live during that time between his lawyer/Daredevil days and the days after his father's death?Still, I believe this film is the victim of the ""Spider-Man"" shadow. Don't get me wrong, I loved Spider-Man but it seems that every film based on a Marvel Character (with the exceptions of X-Men and Blade) gets compared to Spider-Man and I think that's so unfair. DD especially gets it because despite his own great history, most in the mainstream remember him as a on/off partner of the famous wallcrawler (though I would love if one day they did a film with those two teaming up).Anyway, Ben Afflick is okay as Daredevil. Jennifer Garder did surprise me as Elektra. Colin Ferrel is excellent as Bullseye and Michael Clarke Duncan does a very believable Kingpin!I recently bought the blu-ray version of this film and it is great! It features the director's cut of Daredevil (which is the superior version in my view) and all the special features from BOTH the original 2 disc theatrical release and the original director's cut release! This improved film along with the bonus features make this THE version of DD to own!On the D.C. version, it goes from basically a hero looking for revenge for the death of his father and lover (Elektra) to a darker, more brooding anti-hero who seeks redemption. It also shows the Kingpin as more of a threat than the original theatrical release did and it features a subplot that makes the film make more sense and ties it together better!

Now with that said....Lets get the mistakes out of the way first.1.There was not enough time spent with the Kingpin, we should have gotten his back story as well. [he was white in the comics, but Mr. Duncan did a good job.2.some moments wee very cheesy. [see foryourself]3.And finally.....that's it.The film was actually better then I thought it would be, I mean after the Hulk came out I thought Marvel was slippin. I now see that I should have seen this in theatures. I can just imagine what it would have looked and sounded like on the big screen.The effecs in this film were off the hook as well, as well as the camera angles courtesy off Ericson Bore. As far as dialouge goes that could have been a little better at times but over all good, that would be credited to mark steven johnson. I also liked the fact that one of my favorite filmmakers shows up, Kevin Smith. That right there alone makes me want to buy it, oh wait I already did. Casting was on point with this on, putting Ben Affleck as Daredevil was like putting Tobey as peter parker it's a perfect match. And Michael Duncan did a good job as The Kingpin Wilson Fisk. I think the addition of Colin Ferrell as Bullseye was key, he did an excellent job. And Jennifer Garrner did an ok job as Elektra, could have been a little better.

608242,A3ACZ7UFFFCDHA,B00005JLXE,GDAWG,"[0, 0]","I rented this movie yesterday when it first came out, and wasn't expecting much but I'd have to say I was impressed.  I'm in the younger generation so I didn't have the comic books like Spiderman, The Hulk, Daredevil or X-Men available to me so I rely on the movies to tell some of the great stories.  Director/Screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson did a wonderful job of that.  He made it clear what had happened to Matt and how he lived his life afterwards.  The action scenes were superb also with great fighting and matrix type slow motion.12 year old Matt Murdock is a kid that gets picked on at school.  His father (David Keith) tells him not to fight because he is going to become a ""lawyer"" or a ""doctor"" when he's all grown up.  One day he takes a shortcut home from school only to see his father mugging and bullying a guy in the alley.  Devastated from what he's seen Matt runs the other way only into a chemical drop off.  He causes a semi to hit a barrel of chemicals and a spray shoots off into his eyes.He wakes up in a hospital with bandages over his  eyes, and able to hear everything around him, even through the walls.  Obviously his other 4 senses have grown stronger with losing his sight. His dad comes to visit him and says a couple important things, ""I'm sorry"" and they made a promise that neither of them would ever give up.  Keeping their promises the father goes back into his old profession, a prizefighter. Even though Matt is blind his other 4 senses create a radar type vision so he can see some things.  He makes a promise to himself that he would live without fear for the rest of his life, and starts practicing martial arts and fighting.  One night his father is visited by a guy named Falon or Vallon before a fight.  He tells him to take a dive in the fight but keeping his promise to Matt he doesnt give up and wins the fight.  Afterwards out in the street the father is beaten up by 2 guys and then killed and a red rose is left on the body.Years later, when all grown up Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) is a lawyer during the day and Daredevil at night, being a lawyer helps him pick out his victims for the night.  All he wants is justice.  He sleeps in this coffin type thing with water filled up to his ears, because if he were to sleep on the outside he could hear everything going on outside.  He wakes up and goes over to his shelf and takes a 10 dollar bill out of a box and folds it lengthwise and then pulls out a 5 dollar bill out of another box and folds it the other way, so he can tell which one is which.  He goes to work that day and goes to court to defend a purgery victim.  Matt ask him a question and because of his advanced hearing he can hear his heartbeat and can tell if he's lying by his heartbeat speeding up.  Later that night Matt has his justice against this guy and leads to a great action scene.The next day while at lunch with his assistant (talented Jon Favreau) he smells this woman from outside the diner.  She walks in and Matt follows her and just wants to know her name.  He grabs her, she says ""I don't like to be followed and I don't like to be touched,"" then they pull out the martial arts on each other.  After they're done she says ""Elektra Naccios"" (played by Jennifer Garner).  She is the daughter of a billionaire that is in trouble with the Kingpin (Micheal Clarke Duncan), the king of crime in Hell's Kitchen.  He has been squealing to the papers about the identity of the Kingpin.  The Kingpin hires Bullseye (Collin Farrell) to assassinate Naccios.  I won't tell the rest.Ben Affleck and Collin Farrell hand in the best performances, while Jennifer Garner seems out of place but still is great to look at.  Micheal Clarke Duncan hands in a worthy performance also.  Also love the cameos by Stan Lee and Kevin Smith, great.  Mark Steven Johnson does a great job adapting the comic to the movie.  Darker than previous comic book movies, including more violence and murder.  Not as good as Spiderman in my opinion but a must have DVD.  Daredevil is a badass.

It draws the viewer in to the action by making it realistic in its own surreal-ality.Since every other reviewer will give you a synopsis of the film, I won't belabor that issue.  Rather, I'll address the film and its actors directly.Ben Affleck is a good choice for the role of Daredevil/Matt Murdock, although I sure do wish that for this movie (and for him in everyday life) he'd had a better toupee, because it looked like a bad rug from the beginning and never changed its ""fake"" look.Also, Jennifer Garner was a great choice for Elektra.  She's lithe and muscular all at once.Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan are also excellent choices for their roles.A few of my gripes are the fact that the fight sequences seem to be badly shot.  I'm not familiar with this director.  As I understand it, the second director is the one who actually directs the action and filming of fight sequences.  Well the producers need to get the guy who was in charge of the fight sequences for Blade, because those scenes were well shot and directed - in Daredevil, it's as if we're not privy to the full action, by virtue of the way the sequences are shot.The story moves along quickly enough, but in earnest the finale of the film is something of a let down.  I'll admit that I'm a bit jaded by most film's use of action to the very last minute, but here it could sure use a dose of that.All that said, Daredevil is a winner of an action film and a great winner in the superhero categorty.  Marvel may have been late getting to the game with its roster of superheros to film, but once they did, they've done a really great job on the whole.You'll definitely want to check this one out.",3,"Really good, dark superhero movie!",1059523200,"07 30, 2003",2003,1774,"['Daredevil', 'kind', 'superhero', 'movie', 'Batman', 'was', 'dark', 'engaging', 'viewer', 'action', 'making', 'realistic', 'own', 'surreal-ality.Since', 'other', 'reviewer', 'will', 'give', 'synopsis', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'belabor', 'issue', 'Rather', ""'ll"", 'address', 'film', 'actors', 'directly.Ben', 'Affleck', 'good', 'choice', 'role', 'Daredevil/Matt', 'Murdock', 'sure', 'do', 'wish', 'movie', 'everyday', 'life', ""'d"", 'had', 'better', 'toupee', 'looked', 'bad', 'rug', 'beginning', 'never', 'changed', 'fake', 'look.Also', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'Elektra', 'lithe', 'muscular', 'once.Colin', 'Farrell', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'choices', 'roles.A', 'few', 'gripes', 'are', 'fact', 'fight', 'sequences', 'seem', 'be', 'badly', 'shot', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'director', 'understand', 'second', 'director', 'one', 'who', 'actually', 'action', 'filming', 'fight', 'sequences', 'Well', 'producers', 'need', 'get', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'charge', 'fight', 'sequences', 'Blade', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'shot', 'directed', 'Daredevil', ""'re"", 'not', 'privy', 'full', 'action', 'virtue', 'way', 'sequences', 'are', 'shot.The', 'story', 'moves', 'quickly', 'enough', 'earnest', 'finale', 'film', 'something', 'let', 'down', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'bit', 'jaded', 'most', 'film', 'use', 'action', 'very', 'last', 'minute', 'here', 'could', 'sure', 'use', 'dose', 'that.All', 'said', 'Daredevil', 'winner', 'action', 'film', 'great', 'winner', 'superhero', 'categorty', 'Marvel', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'late', 'getting', 'game', 'roster', 'superheros', 'film', 'once', 'did', ""'ve"", 'done', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'whole.You', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'check', 'one', 'out']",N/A

J.""","[6, 8]","I didn't care too much for Colin Farrell's obnoxious one-dimensional character, Bullseye, nor Michael Duncan Clark's unconvincingly cruel Kingpin.  The script short changes the dialogue for the villians but more than makes up for the intimate interactions between Ben Affleck's and Jennifer Garner's characters.  This is the movie's saving grace.  Affleck plays a convincingly somber Daredevil who serves justice to the common man by taking the lives of the guilty.  Despite his physical blindness, his other senses have become extremely amplified and gives him the perceptive powers to fight crime.  He lives his life through revenge and violence.  His alter ego is a lawyer who defends only innocent people or people he knows to be innocent.  This biased character flaw is was makes his dark nature so convincing and deeply touching.  What he cannot see, he feels very strongly.Besides his late father, there is a strong love for Elektra, the lovely socialite aptly played by Jennifer Garner.  And definitely not to be outdone by her secret superhero lover, Elektra seems to hold her own as a martial arts expert (gotta give tribute to the Alias complex).So what is it about Affleck's somber nature and Elektra's survivalist instincts that brings this pair together and make them feel strongly for one another?  A chance for hope, maybe? Whatever it is, the chemistry works well between them and very convincingly, with or without the superpowers.Don't be fooled by the trailers.  There is less action going on in the story than appears, but this is still worth a watch.

Of all those four films this was probably the one that I was the least excited about, but still being a die hard comic fan I had to go and catch it on the opening weekend (well here in Australia anyway).I think a lot of the other appraisals here on Amazon pretty many sums up my views on the pros and cons of this movie.  Firstly the story once again sticks pretty close to the actual comic story, which is always a plus for comics fans.  It gives you good grounding on the origins of the characters, well except maybe Elektra's which deviates slightly from the comic book cannon, an understanding of Daredevil's motivations and what drives him to do what he does.  Marvel obviously wants this movie to spin off into a franchise  (Jennifer Garner has already signed on for the Electra sequel) and Daredevil definitely gave you the right mix of satisfying story and unresolved plot lines / opportunities to expand on plot that a believable sequel should be easy to develop.  Just like a good comic book issue / story line this movie's story is very episodic in nature allowing for most of the major players to return in the future.The movie is also peppered with enough comic cameos (Stan Lee & Kevin Smith) and enough name dropping of famous Daredevil creators (Frank Miller, John Romita, David Mack & Joe Quesada) to give comic fans a rye smile.A lot of people have been hard on the dialogue and performances in this film, I can't understand why.  The interaction between Matt Murdoch and Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson has some great moments and really serves as a great counterpoint to dark and moody action sequences dominated by Matt's alter-ego.  Michael Clark Duncan delivers a stylish, imposing and intimidating performance as Kingpin and Colin Farrell brings just the right amount of psycho madman to Bullseye.  And of course Jennifer Garner is perfect as Elektra.Graeme (the Crow) Revell's score really adds great depth and establishes the mood and texture of the film as well.I do agree with some of the criticism about the fight scenes and effects sequences in the film.  There are just too many of them!  How many shots do we need to see of a rainy, gloomy Gothic Hells Kitchen skyline?  When it comes to the fight scenes, there's only so many times you can see some one do a kick flip or some other wire stunt before the novelty wears off.  The action sequences could have had much more impact without all the unnecessary bullet-time effects and snap close ups and tracking shots.Overall this movie is a great high action, ""dark"" hero story more in the line of say Blade or The Crow than Xmen or Spiderman but it's still a great piece of escapism if you want an enjoyable, no brain action movie.",3,Great Super Hero Action Flick,1048550400,"03 25, 2003",2003,2874,"['Daredevil', 'first', 'taste', 'blitz', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'hit', 'big', 'screens', 'year', 'X-Men', '2', 'Hulk', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'are', 'way', 'four', 'films', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'was', 'least', 'excited', 'still', 'being', 'die', 'hard', 'comic', 'fan', 'had', 'go', 'catch', 'opening', 'weekend', 'well', 'here', 'Australia', 'anyway', '.I', 'think', 'lot', 'other', 'appraisals', 'here', 'Amazon', 'pretty', 'many', 'sums', 'up', 'views', 'pros', 'cons', 'movie', 'Firstly', 'story', 'once', 'again', 'sticks', 'pretty', 'close', 'actual', 'comic', 'story', 'always', 'plus', 'comics', 'fans', 'good', 'grounding', 'origins', 'characters', 'well', 'maybe', 'Elektra', 'slightly', 'comic', 'book', 'cannon', 'understanding', 'Daredevil', 'motivations', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'Marvel', 'obviously', 'movie', 'spin', 'off', 'franchise', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'already', 'signed', 'Electra', 'sequel', 'Daredevil', 'definitely', 'gave', 'right', 'mix', 'satisfying', 'story', 'unresolved', 'plot', 'lines', '/', 'opportunities', 'expand', 'plot', 'believable', 'sequel', 'should', 'be', 'easy', 'develop', 'Just', 'good', 'comic', 'book', 'issue', '/', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'story', 'very', 'episodic', 'nature', 'allowing', 'most', 'major', 'players', 'return', 'future.The', 'movie', 'also', 'peppered', 'enough', 'comic', 'cameos', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'enough', 'name', 'dropping', 'famous', 'Daredevil', 'creators', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'John', 'Romita', 'David', 'Mack', 'Joe', 'Quesada', 'give', 'comic', 'fans', 'rye', 'smile.A', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'dialogue', 'performances', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'interaction', 'Matt', 'Murdoch', 'Franklin', 'Foggy', 'Nelson', 'great', 'moments', 'really', 'great', 'counterpoint', 'dark', 'moody', 'action', 'sequences', 'dominated', 'Matt', 'alter-ego', 'Michael', 'Clark', 'Duncan', 'stylish', 'imposing', 'intimidating', 'performance', 'Kingpin', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'psycho', 'madman', 'Bullseye', 'course', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'perfect', 'Elektra.Graeme', 'Crow', 'Revell', 'score', 'really', 'great', 'depth', 'mood', 'texture', 'film', 'well.I', 'do', 'agree', 'criticism', 'fight', 'scenes', 'effects', 'sequences', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'How', 'many', 'shots', 'do', 'need', 'see', 'rainy', 'gloomy', 'Gothic', 'Hells', 'Kitchen', 'skyline', 'When', 'fight', 'scenes', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'do', 'kick', 'flip', 'other', 'wire', 'stunt', 'novelty', 'action', 'sequences', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'impact', 'unnecessary', 'bullet-time', 'effects', 'snap', 'close', 'ups', 'tracking', 'shots.Overall', 'movie', 'great', 'high', 'action', 'dark', 'hero', 'story', 'more', 'line', 'say', 'Blade', 'Crow', 'Xmen', 'Spiderman', 'still', 'great', 'piece', 'escapism', 'want', 'enjoyable', 'brain', 'action', 'movie']",N/A

In Daredevil, let me be very clear... Ben Affleck NAILED Matt Murdoch. If you disagree then you don't know the character, history, or story of Daredevil that has been in print for so many decades. Matt's brooding, especially when alone. This movie hits it better than Bulls-Eye could hit his target. That made the whole move fantastic. Right, the interaction between Matt and Electra was silly in places (why does she so easily accept his blindness and yet accepts how well he fights and defends himself after knowing him 2 minutes???), and the politically correct move to make Kingpin African-American instead of white which he's been since the beginning was simply a move to garner PC support and DOES detract from the movie for those who know the real storyline of Daredevil and his nemesis. On this DVD, the Producer discusses how nobody could be cast better than the actor who played Kingpin and that may be true but it doesn't excuse the fact they they pandered.

Its one of those rare comic vehicles that attracted the cream of the crop: from Frank Miller to Harlan Ellison. It is still a great read, but how is the film compared to the comic? Well, it is so-so. Ben Affleck did a decent job as Matt Murdoch, the costume looked good, but the character who played Electra did a poor job (I forget her name).Colin Farrell stole the show (as expected) as Bullseye; the fight scenes were OK but some of them were poorly filmed, the lighting was insufficient and you could'nt really tell what was going on. However the movie was pretty faithful to the original comic story. I say ""original"" because none of the Frank Miller storyline was used: Matt's mentor, Stick, or the Hand. That was disappointing but the storyline focusing on Daredevil's origin and his father was compelling.Will they make a sequel?

DAREDEVIL is the first film since SPIDER-MAN to test that theory and, while the film isn't perfect, it doesn't disappoint.  This movie tells the story of Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), who lost his sight when his eyes are exposed to toxic waste in childhood.  However, his remaining senses are amplified to a superhuman degree.  When his father is murdered by mob enforcers, Murdock decides to fight injustice in his own unique way.  By day, he works as a lawyer while he metes his own dark brand of justice nightly as the red-garbed vigilante, Daredevil.  Eventually, he meets and falls in love with the shipping heiress, Elektra (Jennifer Garner).  However, both of them are drawn into tragedy when they become unwittingly involved in the schemes of the city's crime boss, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and his half-crazed assassin, Bullseye (Colin Farrell).At first glance, Affleck would be an unconventional choice for a superhero lead as he tends to play affable, yet somewhat bland, leading men-types, but he pulls it off quite well. You can believe that this is a man who is driven to fight crime while fighting his own inner demons. Also, with so many other characters competing for attention, Affleck succeeds in making and keeping the character as a major focus in the film.  This is opposed to the Batman films where the hero was lost among the villians and supporting characters. Garner is both beautiful and lethal as his love-interest. Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin doesn't have an awful lot to do, but he does make the most of his appearances as the man-mountian behind the crime syndicate.  Colin Farrell is probably the only actor in the film who camps things up a bit as Bullseye, but he succeeds in making him a character to be feared even when we chuckle at his quirks.Director and screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson obviously has a love for the material, having adapted it from the classic Frank Miller-written comics.  He also keeps the film going at a good clip, keeping the film at just over 100 minutes.  However, it would've been nice to see some character motivations more fleshed-out.  The plotline where Joe Pantoliano's newspaper reporter is looking to expose Daredevil is practically glossed over and it would've been nice to see more of the Kingpin's motivations. But this is mere quibbling on my part.  Johnson and his cast treat the material with respect and the film is never allowed to drag. Indeed, it succeeds where the last 2 Batman films failed in presenting its dark hero.  While DAREDEVIL probably won't reach the heights achieved by SPIDER-MAN, it is still a worthy entry in the superhero derby. Definitely one to recommend.",4,"Affleck leads DAREDEVIL's dark, edgy thrill-ride",1045180800,"02 14, 2003",2003,2807,"['hugh', 'success', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'was', 'obvious', 'many', 'film', 'observers', 'superhero', 'films', 'were', 'back', 'vogue', 'major', 'fashion', 'DAREDEVIL', 'first', 'film', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'test', 'theory', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'movie', 'story', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'who', 'lost', 'sight', 'when', 'eyes', 'are', 'exposed', 'toxic', 'waste', 'childhood', 'However', 'remaining', 'senses', 'are', 'amplified', 'superhuman', 'degree', 'When', 'father', 'murdered', 'mob', 'enforcers', 'Murdock', 'fight', 'injustice', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'day', 'lawyer', 'own', 'dark', 'brand', 'justice', 'nightly', 'red-garbed', 'vigilante', 'Daredevil', 'Eventually', 'love', 'shipping', 'heiress', 'Elektra', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'However', 'are', 'drawn', 'tragedy', 'when', 'become', 'unwittingly', 'involved', 'schemes', 'city', 'crime', 'boss', 'Kingpin', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'half-crazed', 'assassin', 'Bullseye', 'Colin', 'Farrell', '.At', 'first', 'glance', 'Affleck', 'would', 'be', 'unconventional', 'choice', 'superhero', 'lead', 'play', 'affable', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'bland', 'leading', 'men-types', 'off', 'quite', 'well', 'can', 'believe', 'man', 'who', 'driven', 'fight', 'crime', 'fighting', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'Also', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'competing', 'attention', 'Affleck', 'making', 'keeping', 'character', 'major', 'focus', 'film', 'opposed', 'Batman', 'films', 'where', 'hero', 'was', 'lost', 'villians', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Garner', 'beautiful', 'lethal', 'love-interest', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Kingpin', ""n't"", 'have', 'awful', 'lot', 'do', 'make', 'most', 'appearances', 'man-mountian', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'probably', 'only', 'actor', 'film', 'who', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'Bullseye', 'making', 'character', 'be', 'feared', 'even', 'when', 'chuckle', 'quirks.Director', 'screenwriter', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'obviously', 'love', 'material', 'having', 'adapted', 'classic', 'Frank', 'Miller-written', 'comics', 'also', 'film', 'going', 'good', 'clip', 'keeping', 'film', 'just', '100', 'minutes', 'However', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'character', 'motivations', 'more', 'fleshed-out', 'plotline', 'where', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'looking', 'expose', 'Daredevil', 'practically', 'glossed', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'Kingpin', 'motivations', 'mere', 'quibbling', 'part', 'Johnson', 'cast', 'treat', 'material', 'respect', 'film', 'never', 'allowed', 'drag', 'Indeed', 'where', 'last', '2', 'Batman', 'films', 'failed', 'presenting', 'dark', 'hero', 'DAREDEVIL', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reach', 'heights', 'achieved', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'still', 'worthy', 'entry', 'superhero', 'derby', 'Definitely', 'one', 'recommend']",N/A

I wasn't really looking forward to watching it after hearing how bad it was from so many people (and because it had Ben Affleck in it), but I soon found out how wrong they were after watching this film.Daredevil is just very entertaining from start to finish. It has good acting from everyone in it, with some actors owning their roles and really impressing me. The story is told nicely and progresses very well throughout the film.But with every good movie, there always has to be something bad in it. One thing that most fans of the comic are quick to point out is the fact that Kingpin was white in the comics, but is black in this movie. This didn't really bother me, seeing as how Michael Clarke Duncan is excellent in the role and also for the simple fact that I have never read the comic before. I also didn't like how the CGI and live action of the movie would constantly switch back and forth so quickly; it gets very annoying sometimes. Most of the problems here, though, are just minor details that most likely will not affect your view on the movie.Overall, the good weight out the bad in this film, as it has to be one of the best superhero movies I've seen in awhile(YES, I even think it's better than X-Men, but not as good as X-2).

Okay, I am certainly NOT a fan of Ben Affleck but his presence in this film was an indifferent one rather than an aggravating one.For those of you who are unfamiliar Daredevil is also known as Matt Murdock, the blind lawyer. But though his eyes do not work his other 4 sense do to a superhuman degree. Sounds, smells, touches and tastes go together to form a bizarre sight that has pros and cons over normal vision. It's pretty cool concept and it's reasonably well done.But Daredevil has NO plot! It's a swift 90 minutes of practically nothing. The most involving part of the film is the romance between Affleck and Garner but it's cut short with the arrival of Colin Farrell who plays Bullseye, a paper-thin but funny character. Many have been annoyed at the fact that the Kingpin is played by a Black-American actor. But what does THAT matter? Who cares if he's white in the comic book? Michael Clarke Duncan brings some formidable integrity to the role but does come off as a bit too cuddly at the same time.A tiny bit of story is set up but it's over very soon. I guess the best you could say is that Daredevil doesn't outstay its welcome. But you'll not remember it 5 minutes after seeing it. And I don't like the fact they chose to separate all Daredevil and Spiderman links just because they were licensed to different studios.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a very powerful DTS 5.1 track.

608257,A1AIRJRJQCNU5L,B00005JLXE,"jackbauerfan ""jack""","[0, 0]","I reviewed the theatrical cut of this movie a while back.  I didn't like it, to say the least.  I thought it was badly written, badly acted, and badly cast.  I stand by that review, but Amazon will only let me put up one review of this movie.  This movie and the theatrical cut are two different movies.  This movie is a huge missed opportunity, and it shows just how idiotic studio execs can be.Daredevil is one of my favorite comic book superheroes.  He is a very unique and interesting character.  He is a crime-fighting vigilante by night, and a lawyer by day.  That is the cool thing about him.  You can have good Daredevil stories with super-villain fights, and good Matt Murdock stories that take place in and around the courtroom.  Personally, the Matt Murdock persona was always more interesting to me than Daredevil.  And this movie is a Matt Murdock story.  The plot of this movie was cut out of the theatrical cut.  Not a subplot, like it says on the back of the box.  THE plot.  The only thing left in the theatrical cut is a couple of subplots.  Matt Murdock agrees to defend Coolio (I don't remember the character's name), who stands accused of murdering a prostitute, Lisa Tazio.  That's the thing about Matt Murdock, he defends the people that no one else wants to defend.  He finds out from Ben Urich, a reporter, that Tazio had access to one of the Kingpin's men.  She was selling Urich information about Kingpin, and they killed her to shut her up.  Murdock realizes this and realizes that not only does this lead back to the Kingpin, but that Fisk is the one who killed his father years ago.  And it makes sense when Daredevil tells Fisk that ""the word's out on the Kingpin.""Now that I have seen the actual movie, I have a completely different outlook on the casting.  Ben Affleck is an alright Daredevil, but a perfect Matt Murdock.  And to me, that persona is more important.  I like Jennifer Garner as Elektra, which is surprising because I did not like her in the theatrical cut.  And role was not cut down a whole lot in that version.  Fans have complained that this version of Elektra is not enough like the comic book character.  In the comics, Murdock and Elektra dated in college.  When her father was murdered, a torn Elektra left Matt.  He next sees her years later, when she has become a vigilante.  The film version of Elektra is partly based on Maya Lopez, aka Echo, from David Mack's run.  The similarities are unmistakable.  Her father is killed by the Kingpin.  She is manipulated into believing that Daredevil is responsible.  She also has a flirtatious relationship with Matt Murdock going on.  When she confronts Daredevil, she realizes that he is Matt Murdock and that he could not have killed her father.  Elektra in this movie is not exactly the same character she is in the comics, but at least they pulled her characterization from somewhere in the comics, not just out of thin air.  The biggest casting problem I had before is Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin.  Kingpin is my favorite Marvel villain, and second favorite comic book villain of all time.  He is a lot more suave in the comics, and he is a lot more in control.  This characterization of Kingpin is okay, though.  It is a new take on the Kingpin, while he still has certain elements of the comic book character.  His two best scenes were cut out of the theatrical version.  In his introduction scene, he sees in the paper that someone has been selling information about him to the papers.  So he kills both of the nearby bodyguards.  Most of his fight with Daredevil was cut out.  In that scene, Daredevil punches him in the face seven or eight times, and he isn't even staggered.  Probably the best casting are that of Foggy and Bullseye.  Colin Farrell was the one thing I liked about the theatrical cut, probably because none of his scenes were cut.  Jon Favreau, current director of the Iron Man movies, is a perfect pick to play Foggy.There were some re-shoots for the theatrical cut, namely the confessional scene and the love scene with Elektra.  The latter scene is probably the worst thing about the theatrical cut.  In that cut, he hears someone getting beat up and wants to go help them, but opts to instead stay and have sex with Elektra.  In the Director's cut, he leaves her on the roof and goes to help the guy getting beat, showing that his role as Daredevil is more important to him than anything else.  When he talks to Foggy the next day, it finally makes sense why he is does not want to pursue a relationship with her.I love this movie.

608259,A13DZQ0NPX855S,B00005JLXE,jancola,"[7, 7]","Let me start by saying that I love Daredevil in all his comic book incarnations (see my other reviews) and I love both Frank Miller and Brian Michael Bendis, so I'm open to different interpretations of the character.  But I thought the movie as shown in theatres was 'da suck.'The big problem was that it felt like the guts of the movie were missing.  It felt like it jumped jarringly from his childhood to his injury in the church and then back around again.  By contrast, this movie takes its time in his childhood, giving his experience with his father more emotional weight.  The church scene still seems out of place but at least you care more.The best addition is that the subplot of Coolio's trial has been added back into the story.  I didn't know it when I saw this movie in the theatre, but practially every scene in the second act of the movie ended with someone moving this trial along.  You should watch this just to know how much you missed!  The trial was actually a well-done murder mystery, and it gave Jon Favreau and even Ben Affleck more of a chance to be actors.Another plus is that the sex scene with Elektra has been axed.  Instead of going home with her, Daredevil has to leave her to help a stranger in trouble.  The scene is very well done and feels much more like Matt Murdock.Also, the fight scene with Kingpin has been extended and feels much more significant.  The breaking of the knees makes more sense and therefore no longer feels cheesy.This movie is still flawed.  Ben Affleck is better but still not quite right.  Jennifer Garner is a lovely actress but she still looks silly kicking sandbags with little devils painted on them.

608261,A3TTSOJM3X1U8S,B00005JLXE,Jasmine T. Baer,"[0, 0]","Teenager Matt Murdock is blinded in a freak accident.  After the accident, Matt loses his sight, but his other senses become super-humanly enhanced.  His father, played perfectly by David Keith, is an over-the-hill prize fighter with ties to the local mob.  With his career back on track, Matt's father is ordered by the local crime boss to take a dive, but he refuses and goes on to win his fight - much to the crime boss's chagrin.Matt pushes himself physically and mentally in honor of his father, and becomes a top attorney during the day, while taking advantage of his heightened senses to become the mysterious vigilante Daredevil during the darkness of night.  Everything seems pretty normal (if you call leading THAT kind of double life normal!) until...Matt meets and falls in love with Elektra Natchios (unconvincingly played by Jennifer Garner - although she sure looked tasty!), the daughter of a billionaire businessman.  Elektra's father is murdered, which leads Matt and Elektra down a collision course with the city's Kingpin of Crime (Michael Clarke Duncan - man, was he convincing!) and his hired hitman, Bullseye (Colin Farell).Once Matt meets Elektra, things move very quickly.  Unfortunately, the film-makers had to develop the relationship between Matt and Elektra quickly, too.  Unlike another dark ""super hero"" movie, The Crow, in which the writers and directors made the love Eric Draven had for his fiancee almost palatable, one never truly gains an understanding for how deeply Matt and Elektra are in love.  The chemistry between Affleck and Garner just really isn't there, and the fact that the two of them are mediocre performers certainly didn't help matters much.  This is too bad, because this story is about the love between Elektra and Matt as well as Daredevil vs. Bullseye and the Kingpin.The movie's soundtrack rocks, and I was pleased to find that the DVD came with DTS sound in addition to the Dolby 5.1.  Jon Favreau was a good Foggy Nelson, Joe Pantoliano was fine as Ben Urich, and Colin Farell made an interesting, albeit somewhat different from the comic book, Bullseye.  Affleck did an OK job as Daredevil, and Garner, as mentioned previously, really is not a very talented performer. I'll give Affleck credit for not messing up Matt Murdock or Daredevil.  I think the fact that he is a huge Daredevil fan helped out tremendously.  His performance had a little more juice and depth than some of his previous stuff - like the over-rated Pearl Harbor fluff.The best performance, hands down, was Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin.  Yes, yes...  I know that the comic book Kingpin was a literally larger than life white guy - a muscular version of Toughman Competition fighter Eric ""Butterbean"" Esch.  But when you finish watching the movie, challenge yourself to find an actor who could have done a better job than Mr. Duncan.  I tried to think of others that could have done the job, but I kept coming up empty.  The people doing the casting nailed this one perfectly.Marvel Comics has scored big with X-Men, Spider-man, X-Men 2, and Daredevil.  Of the three that I have seen (I've missed X-Men 2), Daredevil fits in between Spider-man (that movie was GRRREAT!) and X-Men (Cool, but again, not enough time to develop characters).  If you are unfamiliar with the comic book, this DVD is worth renting.

608262,A1Y4YG58UEN3HJ,B00005JLXE,"Jason Cheng ""zalasta""","[33, 38]","""Lawyer by day, judge and jury by night.""Like many superheroes before him, Matt Murdock leads a double life.  In one of those lives, he defends the innocent in court.  In the other he is known as the Daredevil, a vigilante who takes the law into his own hands and punishes those that take advantages of the loopholes in the justice system.  The unique thing about Murdock is that he is blind, an unfortunate result from a childhood chemical accident.  To compensate the loss of sight, the rest of his four senses are consequently heightened to help him navigate his environment, acting like radar that works in a similar way to the bat sonar.""A man without fear is a man without hope.""Surprisingly, Daredevil isn't a simple crime fighting fare or a showcase of good vs. evil.  Beneath those familiar themes is a struggle with the meaning of justice and revenge.  As expected, the obligatory introduction for the protagonist is there for the benefit of those that are not familiar with the comic.  Even though one can't really fault these sequences for being formulaic (i.e. guy gets hurt, guy obtains superhuman abilities, and guy learns how to perfect these skills), suffice to say the movie does an adequate job of presenting the character of Daredevil to the audiences.I admit to having doubts when hearing Ben Affleck is to don the costume as Daredevil, he just does not look like the superhero type to me.  However, as the film progressed, I became more and more convinced that while he may not be perfect for the role, he did a fantastic job with it.  Affleck was able to translate Murdock's loneliness, his playfulness and his inner struggles to the screen.  He is a complex hero filled with the most basic of human needs, he is as fallible as you and me, and he does not always make the right choices.  The lovely Jennifer Garner plays the tough and resilient Elektra, Murdock's love interest in the movie.  I really appreciate the time taken to develop their relationship with each other, and the chemistry between the two leads is definitely there.The characterizations of the villains, on the other hand, were rather weak.  This is not to say that the performances by Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin and Colin Farrell as Bullseye were bad, but little screen time were devoted to them to flesh out these personalities, which could be the intention of the director for all we know.  Nevertheless, the supporting cast is a strong one; I especially liked Jon Favreau in the part of Murdock's good-humored partner, Franklin Nelson.The veteran Hong Kong master Cheung-Yan Yuen (brother to Woo-Ping) provides the action choreography, evident in the amount of wirework present in the movie.  Personally, I think the film benefited from such collaboration, and it certainly made the fighting sequences much more exciting and stylish to watch.  However, some of the editing of the said scenes left a lot to be desired, for example, the confrontation in the bar at the beginning was hectic and poorly lit, it is hard to appreciate what you cannot see.Not a comic reader myself, I cannot say whether Daredevil is a faithful adaptation of the source material, but I can tell you that I enjoyed every minute of it.  The movie is not without faults, yet I truly believe that it is everything Spider-Man was and more.  It has action for the guys and romance for the women, come to think of it, Daredevil may not be a bad choice to spend part of your Valentine's Day.  It is fun, charming, and a touch sinister.  I really think Marvel has another success in its hands.  Be sure to sit through the credits, there is an additional scene you don't want to miss.",4,Daredevil does not disappoint,1044921600,"02 11, 2003",2003,3657,"['Lawyer', 'day', 'judge', 'jury', 'night', 'many', 'superheroes', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'double', 'life', 'one', 'lives', 'innocent', 'court', 'other', 'known', 'Daredevil', 'vigilante', 'who', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'punishes', 'take', 'advantages', 'loopholes', 'justice', 'system', 'unique', 'thing', 'Murdock', 'blind', 'unfortunate', 'result', 'childhood', 'chemical', 'accident', 'compensate', 'loss', 'sight', 'rest', 'four', 'senses', 'are', 'consequently', 'heightened', 'help', 'navigate', 'environment', 'acting', 'radar', 'similar', 'way', 'bat', 'sonar', 'man', 'fear', 'man', 'hope', 'Surprisingly', 'Daredevil', ""n't"", 'simple', 'crime', 'fighting', 'fare', 'showcase', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'Beneath', 'familiar', 'themes', 'struggle', 'meaning', 'justice', 'revenge', 'expected', 'obligatory', 'introduction', 'protagonist', 'there', 'benefit', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'comic', 'Even', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'fault', 'sequences', 'being', 'formulaic', 'i.e', 'guy', 'hurt', 'guy', 'obtains', 'superhuman', 'abilities', 'guy', 'how', 'perfect', 'skills', 'suffice', 'say', 'movie', 'adequate', 'job', 'presenting', 'character', 'Daredevil', 'audiences.I', 'admit', 'having', 'doubts', 'when', 'hearing', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'don', 'costume', 'Daredevil', 'just', 'not', 'look', 'superhero', 'type', 'However', 'film', 'progressed', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'convinced', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'role', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Affleck', 'was', 'able', 'translate', 'Murdock', 'loneliness', 'playfulness', 'inner', 'screen', 'complex', 'hero', 'filled', 'most', 'basic', 'human', 'needs', 'as', 'fallible', 'not', 'always', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'lovely', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'tough', 'resilient', 'Elektra', 'Murdock', 'love', 'interest', 'movie', 'really', 'appreciate', 'time', 'taken', 'develop', 'relationship', 'other', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'definitely', 'there.The', 'characterizations', 'villains', 'other', 'hand', 'were', 'rather', 'weak', 'not', 'say', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Kingpin', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Bullseye', 'were', 'bad', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'were', 'devoted', 'flesh', 'out', 'personalities', 'could', 'be', 'intention', 'director', 'know', 'Nevertheless', 'supporting', 'cast', 'strong', 'one', 'especially', 'liked', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'part', 'Murdock', 'good-humored', 'partner', 'Franklin', 'Nelson.The', 'veteran', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'master', 'Cheung-Yan', 'Yuen', 'brother', 'Woo-Ping', 'action', 'choreography', 'evident', 'amount', 'wirework', 'present', 'movie', 'Personally', 'think', 'film', 'benefited', 'such', 'collaboration', 'certainly', 'made', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'much', 'more', 'exciting', 'stylish', 'watch', 'However', 'editing', 'said', 'scenes', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'example', 'confrontation', 'bar', 'beginning', 'was', 'hectic', 'poorly', 'lit', 'hard', 'appreciate', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'see.Not', 'comic', 'reader', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'Daredevil', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'source', 'material', 'can', 'tell', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'movie', 'not', 'faults', 'yet', 'truly', 'believe', 'everything', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'more', 'action', 'guys', 'romance', 'women', 'come', 'think', 'Daredevil', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'choice', 'spend', 'part', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'fun', 'charming', 'touch', 'sinister', 'really', 'think', 'Marvel', 'success', 'hands', 'Be', 'sure', 'sit', 'credits', 'additional', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss']",N/A

The story is good, Daredevil should be somewhat tormented and his world is dark and gritty (in contrast to Spider-man.)The action is good, but when will moviemakers figure out that CGI just doesn't convincingly replicate people yet? (I had the same problem with some of Blade 2's action sequences.)The acting is what kills this movie for me. Affleck is OK as Matt Murdock, but pretty awful as Daredevil... DD should be fluid and graceful, and yet in most of the action sequences he looks stiff and wooden. Garner did a great job on the action, but her acting was weak. Farrell as Bullseye was great, very over-the-top (as Bullseye should be.) Duncan did a good Kingpin, too.

Die hard Daredevil fans will most likely hate it due to it butchering of the story lines taken from the comics themselves.  Those who are not fans will most likely enjoy it for it effects, the love story and kinetic action.  I am the exception that I spoke of earlier.  Yes, the characters, story arcs and even some of his powers have been altered for unknown reasons, but if you watch it for what it is, it's pretty good.  No where near the statis of Spider Man, or Xmen (1 or 2), or I suspect even as good as the upcoming Hulk.  But Daredevil was never a wholly mainstream book and it's readers were not always faithful.  Changing writers made the books appeal dip up and down like a rollercoaster.  In turn the cutural consequences of messing with the character didn't carry the weight that it would if characteristics were changed for Spider Man or Xmen.  I liked the movie as a whole, but some aspects were foolishly changed and I cannot understand why.  It's action packed, the chemistry between Garner and Affleck is good, but not great.  Affleck actually plays the character well, and accuratly.  It's strange that with his hollywood status, and his well known liking of the character, that he let this inconsistancy happen.  But it could have been his idea, who knows.  There will most likely be a sequel, let's hope things get better.

He possesses enhanced senses and extraordinary strength and balance, but he generally uses his powers to battle a barrage of cranks and mobsters who could easily be dealt with by local police forces. He claims to represent justice and honor, but he has no qualms about recklessly slaughtering anyone who rubs him the wrong way. He is forced to endure blindness, mass ridicule and the deaths of loved ones, but he never manages to exude the vulnerability that make heroes like Spiderman and Batman such enduring icons. And unlike Spidey and Bats, he has been granted a film so joyless, tasteless and unappealing that only a fringe group of comic book fanatics and action junkies will find themselves exiting the theater with feelings other than disgust and dismay.After a maudlin prologue establishes the title character's unique situation (the usual equation of radioactive material + murdered relative = pissed off superhero), we are introduced to a lawless city where only the vigilante Daredevil (Ben Affleck) stands between order and chaos. Chaos is pitifully represented by Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin, who commits his evil deeds and enjoys his stylish designer clothing in cheerful ignorance of his lack of personality and motivation. When he requires assistance he calls in Colin Farrell's Bullseye, a marginally more interesting fellow who gets his kicks by stabbing people in neck with items you can buy at Staples. As our hero confronts these diabolical forces and engages in a mind-numbing romance with the feisty Elektra Nachios (a beautiful but boring Jennifer Garner), director/writer Mark Stephen Johnson combines a penchant for unimaginative special effects with a love of gratuitous, sickening violence. Innocent people and minor scumbags are stabbed with walking sticks, thrown in front of trains, beaten within an inch of life and even choked with peanuts, often without regard for the plot or the sensitive stomachs of the audience. The carnage is so intense that it diminishes any joy in seeing good triumph over evil and mires the film in gloom and hopelessness.At the center of this travesty is Affleck, an actor whose incredible popularity still remains a mystery to me. In film after film, he comes across as a smarmy, mumbling dolt who can barely keep his eyes open long enough to grasp the plot at hand. As Daredevil, he lacks the basic charisma, passion and intensity that the character requires to succeed, and is ultimately as dynamic as the cardboard cutout of himself that advertised the film.",1,Nightmarishly Horrible,1072137600,"12 23, 2003",2003,2687,"['pantheon', 'American', 'superheroes', 'Daredevil', 'alias', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'somewhere', 'Captain', 'Planet', 'Danger', 'Mouse', 'translation', 'total', 'loser', 'enhanced', 'senses', 'extraordinary', 'strength', 'balance', 'generally', 'powers', 'battle', 'barrage', 'cranks', 'mobsters', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'dealt', 'local', 'police', 'forces', 'represent', 'justice', 'honor', 'qualms', 'recklessly', 'slaughtering', 'anyone', 'who', 'wrong', 'way', 'forced', 'endure', 'blindness', 'mass', 'ridicule', 'deaths', 'loved', 'ones', 'never', 'exude', 'vulnerability', 'make', 'heroes', 'Spiderman', 'Batman', 'such', 'enduring', 'icons', 'Spidey', 'Bats', 'been', 'granted', 'film', 'so', 'joyless', 'tasteless', 'unappealing', 'only', 'fringe', 'group', 'comic', 'book', 'fanatics', 'action', 'junkies', 'will', 'find', 'exiting', 'theater', 'feelings', 'other', 'disgust', 'dismay.After', 'maudlin', 'prologue', 'title', 'character', 'unique', 'situation', 'usual', 'equation', 'radioactive', 'material', '+', 'murdered', 'relative', '=', 'pissed', 'off', 'superhero', 'are', 'introduced', 'lawless', 'city', 'where', 'only', 'vigilante', 'Daredevil', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'order', 'chaos', 'Chaos', 'pitifully', 'represented', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Kingpin', 'who', 'evil', 'deeds', 'stylish', 'designer', 'clothing', 'cheerful', 'ignorance', 'lack', 'personality', 'motivation', 'When', 'assistance', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Bullseye', 'marginally', 'more', 'interesting', 'fellow', 'who', 'kicks', 'stabbing', 'people', 'neck', 'items', 'can', 'buy', 'Staples', 'hero', 'diabolical', 'forces', 'engages', 'mind-numbing', 'romance', 'feisty', 'Elektra', 'Nachios', 'beautiful', 'boring', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'director/writer', 'Mark', 'Stephen', 'Johnson', 'penchant', 'unimaginative', 'special', 'effects', 'love', 'gratuitous', 'sickening', 'violence', 'Innocent', 'people', 'minor', 'scumbags', 'are', 'stabbed', 'walking', 'sticks', 'thrown', 'front', 'trains', 'beaten', 'inch', 'life', 'even', 'choked', 'peanuts', 'often', 'regard', 'plot', 'sensitive', 'stomachs', 'audience', 'carnage', 'so', 'intense', 'joy', 'seeing', 'good', 'triumph', 'evil', 'film', 'gloom', 'hopelessness.At', 'center', 'travesty', 'Affleck', 'actor', 'incredible', 'popularity', 'still', 'mystery', 'film', 'film', 'across', 'smarmy', 'mumbling', 'dolt', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'keep', 'eyes', 'open', 'long', 'enough', 'grasp', 'plot', 'hand', 'Daredevil', 'basic', 'charisma', 'passion', 'intensity', 'character', 'succeed', 'ultimately', 'as', 'dynamic', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'advertised', 'film']",N/A

Plus the original needed more humor and this version has a lot more due to more scenes with Jon Favreau and Coolio being added to this version. Coolio plays a man that might or might not be innocent and that is defended by Matt Murdock (Ben Afflick). This version also shows even more how this is no doubt Afflick's best work in awhile. I thought he was good in the original version but here he has stronger scenes that take the character further. It's a shame I hear he doesn't want to do a sequel because he is really good in the part. Plus doing a sequel would've been a much better choice than doing Suviving Christmas. Wasn't that in the movies for like 2 days ?Anyway there's a lot of strong scenes added that should've stayed in the original. Plus some things change in this version. In the original Afflick stays with Garner's character on the roof in the rain and ignores someone screaming. Then that's followed by a sex scene. Here he says sorry he has to leave and actually leaves and there is no sex scene. So their romance is trimmed down a little but this version also shows that the sex scene wasn't needed. That sex scene was a flaw in the original I realize after seeing this version too. I mean think about it, Murdock is obsessed with justice so he wouldn't just stay with her on the roof and ignore someone in trouble. So this version is much smarter and stronger.

Matt Murdoch (Ben Affleck) is a blind lawyer by day, but by night he is Daredevil, a vigilante crime fighter.  The movie opens and traces the origins of who Matt is and how he became blind, and later how he became Daredevil.  While this is not the main thrust of the story, it is essential storytelling to show us who this blind guy who runs around in a costume fighting bad guys is and how he got that way.  When he was a child, Matt was blinded by some toxic chemicals (aren't they all).  It took away his sight, but his other senses were heightened so much that Matt developed a sort of radar (sound waves reflecting off objects gives him a sense of where they are, much like bats).  When his father was murdered, Matt dedicated his life to helping those who could not protect themselves.  In the real world, this led to him becoming a lawyer and fighting for justice, but when the law does not work, he becomes justice himself and fights as Daredevil.It is after this exposition that we get a chance to see what the story of the movie is going to be.  We meet Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) in a caf&eacute; and Matt is interested enough that he tries to follow her.  Elektra doesn't want to be followed and they get into a little fight that is pretty much their courtship scene.  It is very well done and it gives us clues on how they get interested in each other.  While Elektra and Matt are getting more and more acquainted and friendly, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) has put out a hit on the life of Elektra's father (Erick Avari).  Kingpin sends out Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to kill her father and in the process Bulleye ends up implicating Daredevil.  Elektra doesn't know who Daredevil is yet, and now Daredevil wants to take down Kingpin.  This is the major conflict of the movie.Bullseye steals pretty much every scene he is in, but I don't feel that there is any exceptionally weak part of the movie.  Daredevil (the movie) isn't great, but it is a solid comic book movie and despite the backlash against Ben Affleck he actually does a credible job both as Matt Murdock and Daredevil.  Solid casting all the way through the movie. As a film, it was a little bit better than Spider-man.  It isn't as good as X-Men,  but this movie has been unfairly bashed.

The mature story arcs with adult themes and actual character deaths were handled in a way not seen before in mainstream comics and put that group of artistic works over the top.  Daredevil the movie borrows liberally from that timeframe, after developing the lengthy back story of Matt Murdock's `blinding and awakening'.  I frankly didn't mind Affleck as Matt Murdock.  He certainly played him a lot more tortured than I remember from the Miller era. Duncan as Wilson Fisk aka the Kingpin, also interesting but manageable.  Colin Farrell as Bullseye and Jennifer Garner as Elektra round out the cast nicely.  The final death scene of Elektra is hauntingly familiar to fans of the comics, Bullseye uses the same dialogue leading up to `but me, I'm magic..' and who can forget that impaling on the sai with the tip extended through the body but not the clothes, making a small tent.

The costume were OK, the photography fine, even the first quarter of the film was watchable but once Aflecs character starts matching the girl Electra's moves in the play ground it takes a turn down stupid street and never comes back.That scene is laughable and sets you up for the equally ridiculous Bullseye sequences.  The character looks like a shlemiel with that insignia on his forhead and acts like a two legged chihuahua. His dispatching of a bartender by hurling paperclips into his throat is mind bogglingly idiotic. I don't even want to know why the Elektra character decides that before she goes out to find her fathers assassin she must first change into  leather haute couture.  Lucky for us she's somehow got Ninja Turtle grade skills with those two extreme daggers. Her brutal killing including a shot of the knife blade lifting away her halter back is tasteless and gratuitous. Characters leap and wall ride just like all the twisting leaping ones we've already seen a hundred times before them.Bullseye falls off a building onto a car and - you guessed it -survives (because a car can break your fall?)The cast is weak all around. The script wouldn't even make a good comic book.Don't see this on the strength of SPIDERMAN. That was a fun movie that built on itself scene to scene.

He lives inexternal darkness, but yet he sees the light ininnocent people who he defends by day, and harms theirperps that have been discarded by the justice systemand thrown into his own brand of justice. He plotsrevenge on anybody that harms the innocent. He thentakes on the man that is making him do his job.The Kingpin is his main enemy and he must bring him tojustice before anymore perps get back on the streetWell, I have seen some comic book movies bomb and failto grasp what the comics are about.I also have seen some filmmakers tarnish what is helddear to some people. I have to say, This is how acomic book movie should be done. Everything is notperfect, but it gets its point across and makes senseand makes the film enjoyable to watch. Also, eventhough there were some horrendus actors, I have tosay, that Ben Affleck pulled off the performance ofMatt Murdock decent enough. I also thought thatJennifer Garner was just eye candy and Colin Farrellwas wasted as Bullseye.There were humongous plot holes in this. Iwas absolutely questioning how some of the things werebeing done and why. Some stuff felt out of place andand didn't really gel with what was going on in thefilm. It really made the experience of watching thefilm less enjoyable. I do not like point out plotholes to myself when I am watching a movie. I want thedirector to make sure the film has no plot holes. Whena film has plot holes like Daredevil had, it makes youquestion the writing of the script and the screenplayby whomever wrote it. It really ticks me off when awriter makes such mistakes when he is writing a movieand trying to insert plots. What the writer did herewas a failure to express what was going on. The onlything that I liked about the writing/screenplay wasthat he kept it dark and grimy and evil and good.The acting by Ben Affleck barely impressed me becauseBen Affleck isn't that great of a actor and in hisother roles, he has failed to impress me with hischops. The only movie that I actually liked him alotin was Good Will Hunting and he was very impressive inthat. Mainly, I prefer his counterpart, Matt Damon,who by far is a more accomplished actor than he is. Ihate to say it here, but Colin Farrell was wastedhere. He was basically the best performance out of thebunch and I was satisfied with his performance asBullseye. Jennifer Garner is just eye candy, plain andsimple. She was there to provide the steamy part ofthe movie when she has the part of Matt's crush,Elecktra. I cannot believe they decided to make aspin-off of a eye candy character. Micheal ClarkeDuncan is, in my opinion, a decent actor at best. Ifeel that he has had one great performance in hiscareer and that was in The Green Mile. Again, hefailed to impress me as the Kingpin and I was leftunsatisfied after the movie ended.The movie has its flaws, its sometimesgood performances  and sometimes not so goodperformances .

I have always loved the character so of course I still felt bad because I didn't want to see her die after doing so little in the movie.This is an enjoyable comic adaption, not the best, but not the worse either.",4,Middle of the pack Marvel movie,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,1020,"['movie', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'SpiderMan', '1', 'X1', 'X2', 'however', 'as', 'good', 'SpiderMan', '2', 'least', ""n't"", 'have', 'cheesy', 'horrible', 'dance', 'scene', 'middle', 'movie', 'better', 'X3', 'SpiderMan', '3', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'far', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'line', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'take', 'character', 'obviously', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'never', 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'thats', 'why', 'so', 'dark', 'may', 'remind', 'people', 'Batman', 'character', 'Miller', 'took', '.The', 'BluRay', 'transfer', 'good', 'one', 'like', 'Directors', 'Cut', 'also', 'did', 'original', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'complaint', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Elektra', 'action', 'much', 'think', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'why', 'death', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'character', 'so', 'course', 'still', 'felt', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'die', 'doing', 'so', 'little', 'movie.This', 'enjoyable', 'comic', 'adaption', 'not', 'best', 'not', 'worse']",N/A

A comic book film that doesn't get a whole lot of love just like the 2004 Punisher movie this is underrated which I will reviw the 04 Punisher movie next year. Made for $78 million made $45 million it's opening weekend & $179 million worldwide. Directed by Mark Steven Johnson who would go on to direct Ghostrider. It stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock & Daredevil. Michael Clarke Duncan as Wilson Fisk The Kingpin, Jenifer Garner as Elektra Natchios, Colin Farrell as Bullseye, John Favreau as Franklin Nelson, Leland Orser as Wesley Owen Welch & Joe Pantoliano as Ben Urlcih. The story deals with a kid named Matt Murdock who is beaten up by some bullies in an alley. He is taught by his father who used to be a big time boxer & contender for The World title not to fight. He tells his Dad that the kids at school said that he works for this crime boss named Fallon he tells that he doesn't cause he is working double shifts at the docks. The next day he finds out that his Dad was fired & he finds his Dad in an alley & that he is a Loan Shark for Fallon. Matt runs off & he accidently bumps intoi these containers that has chemicals & it causes him to go blind but all his other senses have been enchanced so he can do all these crazy acrobatic moves. Matt gets revenge on those bullies from earlier on. His father blames himself for what happened to his son. He goes & tries to make a comeback in boxing. Fallon wants him to lose this bout he refuses & in an alley he is beaten to death. A red rose is left by his body. Then it's years later Matt is now an adult & works as an Attorney at this practice with this man named Franklin Nelson. They're trying to put this man away who assaulted this woman & he is found not guilty cause the accuser used to be a drug addict. Matt Murdock knows he is lying cause he can tell by a persons heartbeat if they are lying or not. He is mad that he got away but there is something he can do about it cause at night he is a crime fighter named Daredevil. He tracks that guy down at a strip bar. Wher you have an ok action scene where he fights off these thugs. He chases after that guy down into The Subway Daredevil throws that guy on the tracks & he gets a brutal death. You have this reporter named Ben urlich who is trying to find out who Daredevil is as well as figurings out who this crime boss named The Kingpin is. The Cops have no time for him. Then you are introduced to The Kingpin Wilson Fisk He is told by his right hand man named Wesley Owen Welch that people are talking to the news papers you find out early on that he doesn't put up with any s  h  i  t he kills 2 of his bodyguards. Then you have this guy named Nikolas Natchios who is a business man for The Kingpin he wants out of the syndicate. Kingpin puts a hit out on Natchios & brings in Bullseye who is skilled throwing almost any kind of sharp object & is acrobatic as Daredevil. He is in this bar shooting darts he's drinking & shooting darts at his side instead of looking straight at the dart board. This guy owes him money cause he made a bet  I guess. He mouths something off at Bullseye he uses thes throwing knives they all hit that guys neck killing him. On the plane ride to The States there is this old lady that keeps talking to Bullseye you know trying to make conversation he thumps a pill that hits the back of the seat & goes right into her mouth & cause's her to choke  to death. I mean this is 1 dude that you wouldn't want to mess with at all. Meanwhile Murdock meets this young lady named Elektra who happens to Nikolas Natchios Daughter. You have this fun little scene in the park where they sparr with each other. It was a well shot scene. A plot that was put back into The Director's Cut was involving this character that is played by Coolio who is on trial for murder. Meanwhile you have Murdock go to this black tie affair & Wilson Fisk shows up gives Nikolas Natchios a Red Rose he gets out of there you have Bullsey following him he throws these throwing stars through the windsheild & kills Natchios bodygaurds. Daredevil goes Bullseye & they have a fight he cause Bullseye to miss his target & Daredevil throws his cane at Bullseye he moves out of the way & it impales Nikolas who is killed. Elektra is enraged Daredevil is framed for killing Nikolas Natchios. The scene at the graveyard where My Immortal by Evenesence was well done. The Reporter Ben Urlich finds out who Daredevil really is cause this scientist played by Kevin Smith has possesion of Daredevil's cane. He also finds out information on who The Kingpin is. Meanwhil Daredevil is looking for Bullseye he is attacked by Elektra this fight scene was a little too brief & wasn't the best I mean Ben Affleck & Jenifer Garner aren't the best fighters but they are better than others. She finds out that he is Matt Murdock. Bullseye shows up she learns the truth. She tries to fight Bullseye she throws a sai at Bullseye he catches it throws it back at her & it goes right through her hand. She tries to fight Bullseye but he cuts her throat with a playing card stabs her in the stomach & she dies. Daredevil goes to this church he is friends with The Preist Bullseye comes in Daredevil tells The Preist to leave. This is probably the best fight scene in the movie cause for a guy like Ben Affleck who I don't think oh action star he does have decent fighting skills this was a good fight scene as I said especially how Daredevil defeated Bulleye. Where a sniper is positioned on the roof Daredevil moves out of the way & causes the bullet to  go clean through Bullseye's hands. He is thrown out the window he lands on a car drove by that Repoter Ben Urlich Bullseye is barely alive. Ben Urlich tells the cops who The Kingpin is & gives them information about Wesley Owen Welch. He is taken into custody. During the fight with Bullseye & Daredevil. Bullseye has this red rose he tells him Wilson Fisk always leaves a red rose for his victims. You have another good fight Daredevil fights The Kingpin Fisk owns Daredevil for most of the fight Daredevil asks him why did he kill the only 2 people he cared about. Fisk tells him that he used to work for Fallon & that was just business. Kingpin takes the mask off he finds out Daredevil is Matt Murdock. Daredevil gets a second wind he takes The Kingpin down knocks him down brings him to his knees literally. He decides not to kill him & let The Police arrest him. The Kingpin knows his idenity but won't tell it due to the humilation & his reputation would be killed cause he was beaten by a blind man. Meanwhil Murdock moves on that guy who was accused of  murder in The Director's Cut is found not guilty. Urlich decides not to run The Daredevil story. Murdock goes to the roof where he & Elektra 1st kissed he discovers that she might still be alive & that's pretty much the movie. I'm sorry if I didn't explain the plot all that well in my retrospective. A fairly solid movie. My only problems were not a whole lot of action some of the fight scenes could be better but overall you it is pretty solid. Mark Steven Johnson did a good job directing. Ben Affleck did a good job. I know a lot of people didn't care for Michael Clarke Duncan as The Kingpin for the silliest reason that he is bl  a  c  k but I thought he was a good choice & I'm not taking it back. He is The Kingpin R  I  P Michael Clarke Duncan. Jenifer Garner was pretty good. Colin Farrell did a good job he wasn't he wasn't a goofa  s  s like he was in The Fright Night remake. Joe Pantolino was ok. Leland Orser  was decent. John Favereua was ok. So as I said pretty solid movie I don't understand why this didn't get a sequel I know Ben Affleck doesn't really have anything good to say about this movie which is a shame cause he did a good job as I said. In fact I like this more than any of The Spiderman movies.

I wasn't expecting much. And I didn't get much. It's an OK hero movie, with lots of action, fight scenes, the eternal battle between good vs. evil, a tender love sub-plot, etc.There are some things that got my attention, though:1) Ben Affleck wasn't that bad, but there are many other actors, more talented than him, that could provide for a better performance. But maybe I'm impartial on this point.2) Jennifer Garner stablishes herself as the top actress on action performances. She's pretty, skilled, and seems very comfortable during the action scenes.3) Michael Clarke Duncan and (specially) Colin Farrell, as the ""bad guys"", are very good. It's a pitty, though, that Bull's Eye (Colin Farrell) didn't get more time on screen, and his character wasn't more developed or explored.4) There are some obvious jokes, lines and scenes during the movie, but the script writers apparently restrained themselves, so those jokes, lines and scenes don't happen too often.5) Unlike ""Spiderman"" or ""Superman"" this is not a colorful comic-hero movie. In fact it's dark, played almost every time at night (when the Daredevil goes ""hunting""), and one important characters dies.

608294,A1Q6SDPOCNEM3K,B00005JLXE,J. Tester,"[3, 4]","It certainly is this time around.Daredevil - the Director's Cut, is what the theatrical release was intended to be, when the film was being made. Contractual obligations kept the film from being released in theaters as R-rated, opting instead to cut out many key sequences to achieve a PG-13 rating. This version carries a good deal more weight behind it, with a greatly expanded-upon story and adding back in character development scenes. The movie still struggles through the awkward and out-of-place playground fight scene which is so very out-of-character for Matt Murdock, but the rest of the film hits much closer to home for the horned protaganist.Ben Affleck makes a surprisingly good attempt at portraying Murdock/Daredevil, in this action-adventure film. His scenes as Murdock w/the affable ""Foggy"" Nelson are a pleasure to watch, but he's able to make the transition to the grim and all-too-breakable vigilante, as well. Michael Clarke Duncan's turn as a street-grown version of the Kingpin is interesting and works well enough within the framework of the story, that the departure from the character's origins is negligible for all but the truly hardcore. More-involved fight sequences and fewer romance scenes give this version of the film better pacing and help to center the viewer on the character of Murdock/Daredevil, rather than his relationship w/ hum-drum Jennifer Garner and her less-than-stellar tv actor-quality performances and fight scenes.Overall, this film is still flawed and an uninspired take on the character of Daredevil and the stories of Hell's Kitchen, but it is a far cry better than the theatrical release. In comparison to it's theatrical release, this film is on a whole new level. Fans of Daredevil and comics in general will be able to enjoy this film, despite it's numerous flaws.",4,Aren't director's cuts nice?,1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,1823,"['certainly', 'time', 'Director', 'Cut', 'what', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'Contractual', 'obligations', 'kept', 'film', 'being', 'released', 'theaters', 'R-rated', 'opting', 'instead', 'cut', 'out', 'many', 'key', 'sequences', 'achieve', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'version', 'good', 'deal', 'more', 'weight', 'greatly', 'expanded-upon', 'story', 'adding', 'back', 'character', 'development', 'scenes', 'movie', 'still', 'awkward', 'out-of-place', 'playground', 'fight', 'scene', 'so', 'very', 'out-of-character', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'rest', 'film', 'much', 'closer', 'home', 'horned', 'protaganist.Ben', 'Affleck', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'attempt', 'portraying', 'Murdock/Daredevil', 'action-adventure', 'film', 'scenes', 'Murdock', 'w/the', 'affable', 'Foggy', 'Nelson', 'are', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'able', 'make', 'transition', 'grim', 'all-too-breakable', 'vigilante', 'as', 'well', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'turn', 'street-grown', 'version', 'Kingpin', 'interesting', 'well', 'enough', 'framework', 'story', 'departure', 'character', 'origins', 'negligible', 'truly', 'hardcore', 'More-involved', 'fight', 'sequences', 'fewer', 'romance', 'scenes', 'give', 'version', 'film', 'better', 'pacing', 'help', 'center', 'viewer', 'character', 'Murdock/Daredevil', 'rather', 'relationship', 'w/', 'hum-drum', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'less-than-stellar', 'tv', 'actor-quality', 'performances', 'fight', 'scenes.Overall', 'film', 'still', 'flawed', 'uninspired', 'take', 'character', 'Daredevil', 'stories', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'far', 'cry', 'better', 'theatrical', 'release', 'comparison', 'theatrical', 'release', 'film', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'Fans', 'Daredevil', 'comics', 'general', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'film', 'numerous', 'flaws']",N/A

(although curiously, i also remember praises being sung by such critics as Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin.)eventually it came out what had gone wrong: studio heads, who apparently didn't understand the character, as they had been expecting a more ""commercial"" film, browbeat writer/director Mark Steven Johnson into pretty much ripping the guts out the film. as a result, an entire subplot had been jettisoned, and hastily written new scenes had to be filmed to spackle the thing back together. layers of psychological depth had been removed as a result, and Matt Murdock's personal mission as Lawyer To The Downtrodden was barely perceptible, much less packing any sort of wallop. basically, the studio demanded that what was supposed to be as much a social commentary as an action film be modified into a textbook revenge-for-killing-my-girlfriend yarn. the higher-ups demanded the removal of everything that gave the film a shot at being special.the newly repaired film drove the point home. Matt's and/or Daredevil's personal demons went from an intermittent nuissance to a full-fledge trauma, and Wilson Fisk's ""strictly business"" villainy went from a little larceny to some serious white-collar infractions. as a comedy fan, though, i'm probably most grateful that several meaty scenes for Jon Favreau were ressurrected. it seems especially appropriate as Favreau would render further service to Marvel by directing IRON MAN.for once the overused (and usually cold-bloodedly greedy) Director's Cut concept was not merely useful, it enabled a miracle. we've all seen films we wanted to like turn out to stinkers...but how often do you get to see a stinker film salvaged from the jaws of mediocrity?the situation reminds me of that scene from AMADEUS: the King tells Mozart how his new opera is just brilliant, just absolutely wonderful, only he should remove a few notes. the lesson to be learned is that, unlike that hapless monarch, there are those who, when asked ""which notes do you suggest i remove?"", will have an answer. Johnson should've resisted as Mozart did.[NOTE: as i write this, THE AVENGERS is in theatres and pretty damn good by most accounts. but i must admit that one thing gives me pause, namely the fact that Daredevil (who is an Avenger in the comics) was not invited. what makes it especially surreal is that the Hulk is in the film, even though both of his movies sucked.

608296,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JLXE,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[5, 6]","After the massively successful big screen releases of ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man"", the comic book movie craze began its resurgence in popularity at the hands of Marvel Comics, after suffering from several years of dormancy at the hands of DC Comics. It's no doubt that most eyes were on Marvel for which of their famous superheroes would the next summer blockbuster take its inspiration from? The answer would come in the form of Marvel's crimson-clad hero of New York's Hell's Kitchen, none other than Daredevil.Known as ""The Man without Fear"", Daredevil (Ben Affleck) patrols the area known as ""The Kitchen"" with superhuman abilities granted to him during a tragic accident in his youth that left him blinded. As Daredevil works diligently to clean up the streets, his alter-ego Matt Murdock is finding love for the first time in a mysterious woman named Elektra (Jennifer Garner), while still trying to put as many criminals behind bars in his daily life as a lawyer alongside his long-time friend, Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson (Jon Favreau). However, as hard as Matt/Daredevil tries to protect his city, it seems he is fighting a never-ending battle as more and more criminals are being loosed onto the streets. The more villains' Daredevil encounters, the more he begins to come to the realization that someone else may be orchestrating his city's descent into darkness... a man known as The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan).When ""Daredevil"" was released to theaters I was instantly excited to see it after waiting for so long for comic books to once again have their time to shine on the silver screen. With the excellence found in the ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" series of films, I had very high expectations that Marvel would not let me down with their next heroic film. In my opinion, after seeing both the theatrical release and the Director's Cut, released later on DVD and Blu-ray, I have to say that Marvel has once again successfully made another of their famous heroes come to life for comic book fans the world over to enjoy.Writer and director Mark Steven Johnson (""Ghost Rider"") found himself in a rather unenviable position in my estimation, having to write the screenplay for Daredevil, and also helm the film as well. I'm surprised that Mark chose to tackle both jobs, after all here's a man who by all accounts was an experienced screenwriter with such hits as ""Grumpy Old Men"" and ""Grumpier Old Men"", but as a director he was mostly untested. Not to mention when it came to the realm of superheroes, the films he had previously written and/or directed don't exactly scream ""Experience!"" Even though he was lacking experience (in my opinion), I would have to say Mark Steven Johnson did a surprisingly good job of crafting a semi-realistic version of a blind superhero, not the easiest task as I said a moment ago. I enjoyed that Mark chose to make this a darker superhero film, not going for the light and family-friendly feel of ""Spider-Man"". Daredevil is a hero that is much more violent, and at times willing to come awfully close to crossing the line between hero and villain, more so than many of the other heroes in Marvel's comic books. So, I appreciated that when all was said and done, Mark chose to have ""Daredevil"" remain reasonably loyal to the source material, something that many others before him had failed to do, which is why so many other comic book movies of the eighties and nineties never worked out as well as they could have.As much as I enjoyed ""Daredevil"", I must admit that it is far from being a perfect movie. Although the problems that I have with the movie are not the biggest, or come close to ruining the experience, I feel they do merit at least a mention. For starters in the early portion of the movie, it seems as if Mark wasn't sure exactly how he wanted to handle the movie, whether he wanted it to be a serious, dark exploration of a more tortured hero (similar to ""Batman Begins"") or if he wanted to play up the humor and more comic book-like feel of superhero movies of the early nineties (in the vein of ""Batman Forever"" or ""Batman & Robin""). Also a few times it seemed as if Mark couldn't resist the use of cheesy feeling close-ups during pivotal line readings, for instance when Matt tells Foggy that he can't go out and drink because, in his own words, ""I have work to do."" With those words you just imagine the director saying, and ""Cue close-up on Ben... perfect!"" As I said earlier, these moments are nothing but pure cheese and prove to be ultimately unnecessary to drive home the point that Matt's a hero with a mission. Thankfully, these annoying close-ups disappeared after the first thirty minutes; however, there were a few other gripes I had sprinkled throughout the movie's duration.The other set of gripes I had with ""Daredevil"" centers around the overuse of wirework for many of the action sequences. I know that wirework is commonplace on movie sets for action set pieces; however, when the work is either too obvious or too exaggerated it tends to take away from the scenes. This occurs numerous times in the film, first when Matt and Elektra have their confrontation/conversation in the park. While the scene is a lot of fun, the wirework was obvious during several moments within the scene. Later on in the film when Daredevil confronts Bullseye in the church both men make impossibly large leaps throughout the entire fight. Now, I understand that this is a film based upon a comic book series, and yes, Daredevil does have superhuman abilities which may allow for him to be able to jump higher (which is kind of discussed early on in the film). However, Bullseye, as far as I can tell, is nothing more than an experienced marksman, and doesn't have any kind of superhuman agility or anything of that nature, so for him to make the same size of leaps as Daredevil causes a problem for me, and draws attention to the far too exaggerated wirework being employed.With my gripes out of the way, I will now move onto the actors performances within the film. Ben Affleck has never been one to be considered one of the finer actors of his generation; however, in this film he does surprisingly well with every facet of the character. Not to mention the fact that he's playing a blind person, which cannot be easy for an actor, because no longer are they allowed to use their eyes to assist them in communicating what they may be feeling internally or just to connect with the other actor(s) within the scene. Personally, I still find it surprising that so many people chide Ben for his performance here; I think it's a good performance, and for him it's one of the better ones in his career. Alongside Ben, actress Jennifer Garner (""13 Going on 30"") was an excellent choice for Daredevil's significant other, Elektra. Elektra's arc was similar to that of her comic book counterpart's, and without going into any detail (for those that haven't seen the movie), the sort of ""transformation"", as it were, that her character goes through over the course of the film was very well done, and Jennifer handled the two different aspects of her character perfectly.In the supporting cast we have Jon Favreau (""The Replacements"" and director of ""Iron Man"") as Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson, Matt Murdock's partner at his law firm. Jon was hilarious as Foggy (as he's commonly known in the comics), providing the lion's share of the humor within this otherwise gritty, dark superhero film. Thankfully, the Director's Cut of ""Daredevil"" featured even more of Jon as Foggy, which made him a more rounded out character, rather than someone that just pops up every once in a while to provide a little comic relief. Academy Award nominated actor Michael Clarke Duncan portrays the film's primary villain, The Kingpin. Although in the comics Kingpin is generally a Caucasian male, for the film the decision was made to go with Michael due to a couple of factors. One, the sheer size of Michael was a good match for Kingpin's, and secondly, because Michael had the acting chops to be able to convincingly make such a large, somewhat heavy set man appear even more menacing than some other actors may be capable. Kingpin's role was another one that benefited greatly from the Director's Cut, as several portions of his storyline were cut for time and rating constraints. After watching his additional scenes that were added back in, Kingpin's story works so much better in the grand scheme of the film, and doesn't feel nearly as tacked on as it once did. Lastly, Colin Farrell as Bullseye was absolutely perfect. Colin played Bullseye the only way he could be, as nothing more than a cold-blooded killer with a semi-obsessive compulsive approach to murder. You could tell when watching the movie that Colin was relishing every moment he had onscreen, and while Bullseye isn't exactly heavily featured in the film, his scenes definitely stand out as favorites for me within the movie. I would have liked for Bullseye to have been the primary villain for either this movie or a sequel, as he has carried many issues within the comic books easily as the lead villain. Basically, a little more detail on both Bullseye and Kingpin in this movie or a sequel, would have been nice.All complaints aside, and for the record my complaints didn't really take away too much from my enjoyment of this film, ""Daredevil"" is still among my favorites for superhero movies. While it's not a perfect film, ""Daredevil"" makes a very strong effort at bringing one of the more difficult comic book characters to life on the big screen.""Daredevil"" is rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, and sensuality.""Daredevil: The Director's Cut"" is rated R for violence and language.",5,The Man Without Fear...,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,9696,"['massively', 'successful', 'big',

If you are expecting a story or hero like Spider-Man, you are in for a shock.The directors cut of Daredevil is one of the best directors cuts i have ever seen. Not only does the plot have more substance with the addition of deleted scenes, but also ties up plot holes as well. There was also a whole subplot about blind lawyer Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) and Foggy Nelson (Jon Faverou) defending what looks like a guilty client, played by the 90s rapper Coolio.In this cut, you see more Matt Murdock, and you can actually see why Mark Steven Johnson chose Affleck to play the blind vigilantie. When i first saw the original version, i htought that Affleck was ok. But after this, i can say that Affleck was the perfect choice for Daredevil/Matt Murdock.But still i have to say that Collin Farrell as Bullseye steals the show. Not only did he play him to a tea, but he also made Bullseye a more interesting character than he is in the comic series.The R rated director's cut also has a more grittier, dark edge to the film, compared to the PG 13 rating that the original version has. Expect more graphic fight scenes, and plenty more swearing by the characters.Overall, I must say that this cut definitly does justice to fans of the comic. If you dont have this in your collection, get it.This DVD also has a good mini documentary about how the directors cut was made.",4,Definitly Does Justice to fans of the comic,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,1392,"['First', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'are', 'expecting', 'story', 'hero', 'Spider-Man', 'are', 'shock.The', 'directors', 'cut', 'Daredevil', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'cuts', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Not', 'only', 'plot', 'have', 'more', 'substance', 'addition', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'also', 'up', 'plot', 'holes', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'also', 'whole', 'subplot', 'blind', 'lawyer', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Foggy', 'Nelson', 'Jon', 'Faverou', 'defending', 'what', 'guilty', 'client', 'played', '90s', 'rapper', 'Coolio.In', 'cut', 'see', 'more', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'why', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'chose', 'Affleck', 'play', 'blind', 'vigilantie', 'When', 'i', 'first', 'saw', 'original', 'version', 'i', 'htought', 'Affleck', 'was', 'ok', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'Affleck', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'Daredevil/Matt', 'Murdock.But', 'still', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'Bullseye', 'show', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'play', 'tea', 'also', 'made', 'Bullseye', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'comic', 'series.The', 'R', 'rated', 'director', 'cut', 'also', 'more', 'grittier', 'dark', 'edge', 'film', 'compared', 'PG', '13', 'rating', 'original', 'version', 'Expect', 'more', 'graphic', 'fight', 'scenes', 'plenty', 'more', 'swearing', 'characters.Overall', 'must', 'say', 'cut', 'definitly', 'justice', 'fans', 'comic', 'dont', 'have', 'collection', 'get', 'it.This', 'DVD', 'also', 'good', 'mini', 'documentary', 'how', 'directors', 'cut', 'was', 'made']",N/A
608299,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JLXE,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","""Daredevil"" has always been one of my favorite Marvel characters.  It truly was a surprise to me when I first learned that a film was actually going to be made about him.  He teamed up with Lou Ferrigno's ""Hulk"" when that TV series was used to crank out a few TV movies, but that particular flick was wretched.  It did no justice to the ""Daredevil"" character.This ""Daredevil,"" however, stays fairly true to the comic book, although I felt the story dragged somewhat.  The worst part of the movie was when Murdock and Elektra first meet.  The scenes with the two of them ""play-fighting"" came across as too rehearsed and just downright sugary.  Too sugary for a complex hero like ""Daredevil.""  Other than that, the movie is very good.  Comic faithfuls and general movie-goers alike will not be let down by this film.  It contains enough action and humor for anyone, and seems to flow in the same vein as Michael Keaton's portrayal of ""Batman"" in the first of that series of movies.The film is very dark, and very violent, which stays true to form when compared with the comic book, especially during the Frank Miller era.Whenever I watch ""Spiderman,"" I get this happy feeling from when I was a child still growing up.  It takes me back to a time when superheroes were clean cut, patriotic, and all-around good guys.  When I view ""Daredevil,""  it takes me to my teen years when I thought the world was against me and no one was ever going to help me through.  At that time, superheroes were no longer the good guys, they had become as complex as normal human beings and fought with themselves more than against an enemy.  This type of hero is closer to the real deal, he has problems, both physical and emotional, and there are no defined enemies anywhere.One other small note, if you have young children, I don't suggest letting them watch this film.

608301,A2W4BX2P3AKDIC,B00005JLXE,K McK,"[1, 1]","Please note that this review is for the original theatrical release (which is, in fact, what this (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition) DVD is. If you want the director's cut, you need to go to the entry which says, ""Director's Cut""). I have not seen the director's cut, because I'm not sure if I can stomach more of the same movie, and I doubt that the cut could possibly fix the biggest glaring flaw in the theatrical release.What's wrong with this movie, you ask? Well, let me start with a summary of just who Matt Murdock is in the comics:MATT AND THE LAW:Matt Murdock is a highly intelligent defense and civil attorney, who truly believes in the law.As Matt Murdock, he largely defends people who are down and out. And, with few exceptions, he will even defend guilty people. This is because, more than putting criminals away, he needs to believe in the system.As Daredevil, he always operates just on the right side of the law (unless one counts assault and battery, of course). He's a highly skilled martial artist (more on this later) - which is a good thing, since this means that he doesn't need to kill his opponents in order to win. Which is good, because refuses to kill. EVER. He doesn't believe he has the right to decide who lives or dies. He beats people up, sure. Sometimes (especially lately) he will even seriously maim people. But, no matter how much pain he's in, no matter how much grief and anger he's going through, he always stops short of killing, because he believes it's wrong. Always. Even when it comes to Bullseye.Just to reiterate: Daredevil. Does. Not. Kill. EVER. No matter how much he may want to. If it seems like I'm harping on that fact, it's because I am. Aside from his tremendous compassion for strangers, the biggest thing that makes DD a *hero*, is his tremendous sense of justice and fair play, his willingness to hold himself accountable for his actions (even if he sometimes has to compromise ethically, he has to be dragged into it kicking and screaming), and his recognition that, no matter how much it hurts, he does not have the right to play judge, jury, and executioner. And I am absolutely APPALLED that the moviemakers did not recognize this.If DD were to encounter a rapist who got off scott-free (which, incidentally, is a case he would never prosecute as Matt Murdock, since he is not a prosecutor, and even if he did, he would never give a closing argument so lame and devoid of logic), he would keep an eye (or an ear, as the case may be) on the guy, and wait for him to break the law again, and then pounce, and present the evidence to the authorities. He would NOT chase the rapist onto some subway tracks and then stand by and jeer while the guy gets run over by a train!!! GAAH! He didn't even do that in the comic when it was Bullseye on the tracks, and he had good reason to truly *hate* Bullseye! In one scene, the moviemakers managed to take every single thing that makes DD a hero, and turn it upside-down.And I will never forgive them for that.MATT AND HIS BLINDNESS, SENSES, AND MARTIAL ARTS SKILLS:In the comics, Matt was hit in the face with a canister of radioactive waste, and woke up in the hospital blind, with all of New York screaming in his ears. This, actually, was well portrayed in the movie - for all of about 20 seconds (before he miraculously learned how to interpret and use an essentially completely alien set of senses).In the comics, this was somewhat more realistically handled - Matt was terrified for weeks, before a rather abusive blind sensei by the name of Stick basically whacked him over the face and told him to grow up. Then he basically put Matt through months (or years, the comic isn't very clear on this) of boot camp, constantly pushing an eager-to-please Matt to higher skill levels. Matt EARNED those martial arts and acrobatic skills in the comic. They weren't just miraculously given to him.MATT AND DARKNESS:As far as I know, in addition to losing his father and finding his body after he'd been shot point-blank in the face (and keep in mind that blind people recognize their loved ones by touching their faces)...Matt has lost at least 4 girlfriends (to death, as opposed to the countless girlfriends he lost because they left him or turned out to be psychotic killers). Two of them he loved with all his heart, and they were both slaughtered by Bullseye, right in front of him. Also, recently he's been placed in jail and forced to stand by, helplessly, and listen while Foggy got stabbed (apparently to death). Every time something like this happens, Matt goes through a dark, depressed period (which gets darker each time), where he withdraws from his friends and becomes overtly hostile to the people who want to help him. Each time, his actions become progressively more self destructive... and sometimes, downright bizarre, as he struggles to make sense of the chaos and pain inside his head....and yet, at the same time, he also becomes somehow *more* self-sacrificing, *more* compassionate to the strangers he helps, *more* determined to spare everybody else the pain that he's been through, and *more* heroic, with each new trauma. And then, through sheer force of will, he works his way through it, always keeping his actions on the right side of the law, and struggling to forgive the idiots who make his life a living hell.-----In other words, Matt Murdock, as portrayed in the comics, is a true hero, even though he's dark. A person who proves that even if you have darkness inside of you, you can, if not overcome it completely, at least keep it pushed down. He is a person who is worthy of tremendous respect... the kind of respect that many fans reserve for Captain America.In contrast, Matt Murdock, as portrayed in the movie, deserves no respect whatsoever. He's a sadistic playboy who feels no accountability for his own actions. He is the exact opposite of the real, deep, tortured, generous, compassionate, intelligent, ethical champion of true justice that's portrayed in the comics.And that is why I hated the movie. Dislike is far too mild a word. I HATED this movie.Aside from the complete character asassination of one of the greatest heroes out there, there were a couple of other issues, many of which I imagine were fixed in the Director's Cut:- The CGI which ignores little things like the laws of inertia and gravity (in real life, if you take a running leap, the leap will carry you forward. Not 15 feet straight up).- The absolutely moronic playground fight, conducted in front of kids, out of costume, apparently because the fighters *liked* each other?I've said it before, and I'll say it again... I wish so badly that the moviemakers had just used Frank Millar's ""The Man Without Fear"" as a script. That story was the perfect origin story to Daredevil, with *intelligent* action and solid (and true) characterization. I would have really enjoyed seeing that movie. Instead of struggling to get through it without throwing something heavy at my TV.",1,Awful interpretation of a wonderful comic (updated review),1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,6987,"['Please', 'note',

608302,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,B00005JLXE,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[1, 2]","You know, Superman ain't that brave - short of kryptonite knuckledusters, the average criminal can't hurt him at all. And Batman, at least on the big screen, is wearing bullet-proof armour - that shows a certain level of ""caution"". What does it take to be ""The man who knows no fear""? I'll take complete invulnerability, thanks. Some super-strength would be nice, too. No? I don't get any of that?Daredevil, the man who knows no fear, isn't invulnerable, isn't bullet-proof, and isn't super-strong. He's blind. I'm not kidding - he lost his sight as a child in an accident. Admittedly, his other senses were heightened to a remarkable level - his hearing, in particular, is extremely acute. So acute, that a resonant sound will bounce off things and give him a radar-like image of his surroundings (I gotta say, even though the movie and the comics talk about radar sense, it is actually SONAR, as used by submarines - would it have been so hard for them to get that right?). The catch is that he has to sleep in an isolation tank, because all the sound in New York keeps him awake.Daredevil, like every good superhero, has a secret identity - his is Matt Murdock. Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) is a lawyer who will never make the big time because he insists on working for the innocent, and prosecuting the guilty, much to the despair of his long-time partner, Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson (Jon Favreau). Matt is a man for the ladies, and he's not above using his blindness as a ploy to pick them up. It doesn't work with the latest gorgeous, but mysterious, woman (Jennifer Garner, who looks really good with green eyes) - she brushes him off. When he follows her, she gets physical, and is astonished that he can fend off her attack. Their sparring gets more serious and becomes a form of foreplay - this is one of the sexiest fight scenes you'll see, as well as being an impressive use of playground equipment. (The extras show how it was Affleck and Garner doing all the wire work for this sequence - quite impressive).For an action movie like this we need a villain, or two, and we have them in Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Bullseye (Colin Farrell). Both are absolutely fabulous in their roles.This is a dark movie, much darker than Superman, and even darker than Batman. And that's right, because Daredevil isn't a light-hearted character, fighting for truth, justice, et cetera. He's a vigilante, seeking revenge more than justice, revenge on a world that killed his father. His is not the shiny world of Metropolis, or even Gotham City supported by the Wayne Foundation; he lives in Hell's Kitchen New York, the ghetto.

608307,A3013MHSQS4Y8Y,B00005JLXE,lobohombreriera,"[0, 0]","Since ""Blade"" came out in 1999, Marvel Comics caught a big one with the super-hero movies. A year later, Bryan Singer proved with ""X-Men"" that comic book adaptations could be both ambitious and succesful, then... a monster was born. ""Blade 2"", ""Spiderman"", ""X-Men 2"" and ""The Hulk"", all hit (and smashed) the box office, and many more are on the way. Of all these flicks, only ""Daredevil"" was a financial disapointment, and I have to say that 10 minutes into the movie you can see why.First of all, and I think most people agree on this, the main problem of ""Daredevil"" is its lead star. Ben Affleck is an actor that just doesn't seem to make it . He is very good as Matt Murdock, the pro-bono lawyer, and you even like the guy when he talks to his buddy in the Seinfeld-like coffee shop. However, once he puts on his superhero costume, the magic runs out. Affleck just doesn't have the dark sex appeal necessary for the nocturnal vigilante (anyone who has seen Tim Burton's Batman knows how important this is), therefore his character fails to deliver the necessary empathy or connection between the audience and the hero. You would think that with such a problem, the supporting cast should make up for the rest, but you're wrong. The movie has some beloved Marvel characters like Elektra (Jennifer Garner), Bullseye (Colin Farrell) and Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), but none of them is crucial to the story. NONE OF THEM! I swear to God that if you add up all the scenes in which they are, none of them is on the movie for more than 20 minutes. Or at least, it doesn't seem so. Elektra, especially, was thought to be the best thing in the movie. At least, in the trailers it looked like she was. She sort of is, but she only has two (I repeat, TWO) fight scenes, and her character is pretty much wasted. So is Bullseye, who is little more than a cartoon in Colin Farrell's hands. As for Kingpin, well, I don't mind that they changed his looks dramatically, but he's the least developed character. A stupid plot twist makes him Daredevil's archenemy, and the end is just silly and pathetic.Another problem is the plot. Or better yet, the ""plots"". A lot of things happen in the movie, but none of them are central. There comes a time when Elektra is out to kill Daredevil, believing he's her father's murdeder. THAT should've been the movie, but it is resolved quickly and without consequences. Anyway, in plot, character and performances, ""Daredevil"" takes the plunge big time.The edition is another story. It is by far one the best I've seen. It would be easier to say what doesn't have. Of all the documentaries, featurettes and other features, some are dedicated to the comic book, others to the movie. Both are great. It seems like this time New Line Cinema really went for the money, which makes me think that they hope ""Daredevil"" to be a hit on DVD more than it was on the theaters. If you're a fan of the comic book, then these features should be more satisfying that the movie itself.There isn't much more. I really can't say that I liked ""Daredevil"", but I've seen worse. However, of all these superhero fever, I advice you to stick with ""The Hulk"" or ""X-Men 2"". This goes to show you that for a comic-book adaptation to be good, it's not all about big budgets and special effects. There's something more, and this one doesn't have it. I've heard that they are preparing new superhero movies, including a second ""Spiderman"", a third ""X-Men"", ""The Fantastic Four"", ""Elektra"" and ""Catwoman"".

The sexual tension between Matt Murdock and Elektra was very well acted and I loved seeing Michael Clark Duncan's portrayal of The Kingpin.  Colin Farrell's Bullseye was simply delightful to watch, as was Jon Favreau's Character.  Jon Favreau seem to be a permanent fixture in Marvel films, and I don't mind at all, as he adds so much comic relief.  The action and special effects were spectacular to watch, and I loved the movie's interpretation of Daredevil's costume.  Great acting, fantastic soundtrack, awesome star power, with killer action and special effects makes Daredevil a must for anyone's movie library.  I add, however, a small caveat to this review.  Make sure to purchase the DVD and not the Blu Ray, as the DVD is the only media one can view the original theatrical film.  The Blu Ray only contains the directors cut, which is not so good.

608316,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00005JLXE,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Marvel comics has launched an assault on moviegoers with a line up of films that are about to undue the bar set by DC comics' BATMAN and SUPERMAN. The success of SPIDERMAN set about a bidding war that resulted in several of their titles being picked up and work is in progress on a number, including IRON FIST and THE PUNISHER. But before those two ever hit the screen, anther title made its way and did well- DAREDEVIL.Ben Affleck stars as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer who has abilities that offer him more sight than any other mere mortal. As a youngster, Matt was injured in a freak accident that left him blinded. But the chemicals that robbed him of his sight also gave him greater gifts, a sharper sense of hearing and a sort of radar sense.When his father, a boxer who refused to throw a fight and lose in front of his son, is murdered, Matt dedicates himself to fighting for justice. Developing his senses, his mind and his body, Matt becomes a lawyer who defends those without hope. And at night, he becomes Daredevil, donning a red leather costume and disguise as he tracks down those who evaded justice by twisting the law.In his daytime guise, Matt meets and falls for a woman named Elektra (Jennifer Garner), the daughter of a wealthy man who is a cohort of the infamous Wilson Fisk ( ), an underworld leader known as the Kingpin. It is the Kingpin who has been moving into the neighborhood Daredevil protects, the Hell's Kitchen area of New York, Matt's childhood home.When Elektra's father is murdered by Kingpin's assassin Bullseye (Colin Ferrell), the hit is made to appear as if it was done by Daredevil. Trained in numerous martial arts herself, Elektra sets out on a course for revenge against Daredevil, never realizing who he is or how innocent he might be. And while she pursues him, Bullseye sets his sights on her.More story involving Kingpin and Daredevil in one rivalry and Bullseye and Daredevil in another keep the plot going and offer a chance to find out the character motivations of the man beneath the mask.Filled with religious icons aplenty and morals not often found in most stories today, DAREDEVIL offers plenty of action but with something solid beneath it all. Affleck does a great job in the lead role, offering a caring daytime persona and a fear influencing sight to see at night. Garner is superb while looking the part of the object of Matt's infatuation one minute and the avenging angel of death the next. The standout performance here though is Ferrell as Bullseye, a maniac from top to bottom with a wry sense of humor that will have you laughing while being glad he doesn't really exist at the same time.Perhaps the most important aspect of this film, at least for comic fans, is the fact that this movie looks exactly like a comic book come to life. The images seen are sometimes used from the actual comic, including some created by Frank Miller and Joe Quesada in their runs as artists on the book. Daredevil standing atop a church, arms around a cross in the dark of night are both eerie and offering a glimpse of the motivations of the man without fear.If you're looking for a fun movie, dark and light, filled with story as well as action, then you'd be hard pressed to find one more filled with both than this one.A large number of fans and critics alike pounded on this movie when it was released. I challenge them to go back and watch it again. To me this movie holds up better than the last two Spider Man flicks.

608317,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005JLXE,Martin Asiner,"[0, 0]","The Daredevil of the comics has thrilled readers for decades.  This Daredevil was a pre-politically correct visually challenged crime fighter who did not allow his constant exposure to riffraff affect his inherent moral compass.  The conversion to the movie Daredevil by director Mark Steven Johnson gives a glooomier red-costumed figure who has to deal with a continual need to re-evaluate just why he needs to swing from rooftops to catch criminals.In DAREDEVIL Ben Affleck is Matt Murdock, lawyer by day, and Daredevil by night.  The first fifteen minutes sets the basic philosophical tone about the need for vengeance.  The 12 year old Matt is bullied by his peers (One of whom is Robert Iler, a teen actor from the Sopranos who in real life was arrested for mugging) and has to run from them.  After he suffers the loss of his sight, his other senses compensate so that when these bullies return, Matt thoroughly thrashes them.  Matt could have simply absorbed their taunts, but as they were walking away, Matt manhandles them, thereby setting in motion an emotional kinetic force that demands blow for blow.  When his father, an unretired boxer who refuses to throw a fight is killed for his lack of co-operation, Matt again is faced with choosing vengeance or allowing the law to handle matters.Unsurprisingly, Matt chooses the former. To this unhealthy desire for vengeance, he adds vigilantism.  When a rapist is unjustly found not guilty, Matt as Daredevil chases him down and throws him in front of a train, killing him.  Finally, when his girlfriend Elektra (Jennifer Garner) seeks revenge, first on him for thinking he was the killer of her father then on a hitman Bullseye (maniacally played by Collin Farrell), the entire question of the justness of seeking revenge is muddied by the glee of those who find it and their sorrow afterwards.Fortunately for the audience, DAREDEVIL is not a visual tract on philosophy or ethics.  It is, instead, a visual feast that presents the viewer with nonstop action sequences that are so over the top that their logical flaws get lost in the shuffle.  Director Johnson would have you believe that the ability to make astounding leaps and impossible dives is not limited to the hero, which in any case is hard enough to swallow.  Both Bullseye and Electra have no problem performing the kind of aerial stunts made popular in HIDDEN DRAGON, CROUCHING TIGER.  It is this trio's ability to fly on command that stands at the core of viewer interest.  This other nonsense about the need for vengeance is window dressing, tossed in only to give a break between action sequences.  On that visual basis alone, DAREDEVIL is worth the price of a rental, but for more substantial filmed analyses of introspection, this will not do.",3,A Dark Daredevil,1060214400,"08 7, 2003",2003,2770,"['Daredevil', 'comics', 'thrilled', 'readers', 'decades', 'Daredevil', 'was', 'pre-politically', 'correct', 'visually', 'challenged', 'crime', 'fighter', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'constant', 'exposure', 'riffraff', 'affect', 'inherent', 'moral', 'compass', 'conversion', 'movie', 'Daredevil', 'director', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'glooomier', 'red-costumed', 'figure', 'who', 'deal', 'continual', 'need', 're-evaluate', 'just', 'why', 'swing', 'rooftops', 'catch', 'criminals.In', 'DAREDEVIL', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'lawyer', 'day', 'Daredevil', 'night', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'basic', 'philosophical', 'tone', 'need', 'vengeance', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Matt', 'bullied', 'peers', 'One', 'whom', 'Robert', 'Iler', 'teen', 'actor', 'Sopranos', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'arrested', 'mugging', 'run', 'loss', 'sight', 'other', 'senses', 'compensate', 'so', 'when', 'bullies', 'return', 'Matt', 'thoroughly', 'Matt', 'could', 'have', 'simply', 'absorbed', 'taunts', 'were', 'walking', 'away', 'Matt', 'thereby', 'setting', 'motion', 'emotional', 'kinetic', 'force', 'blow', 'blow', 'When', 'father', 'unretired', 'boxer', 'who', 'throw', 'fight', 'killed', 'lack', 'co-operation', 'Matt', 'again', 'faced', 'choosing', 'vengeance', 'allowing', 'law', 'handle', 'matters.Unsurprisingly', 'Matt', 'former', 'unhealthy', 'desire', 'vengeance', 'vigilantism', 'When', 'rapist', 'unjustly', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'Matt', 'Daredevil', 'down', 'front', 'train', 'killing', 'Finally', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'Elektra', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'revenge', 'first', 'thinking', 'was', 'killer', 'father', 'then', 'hitman', 'Bullseye', 'maniacally', 'played', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'entire', 'question', 'justness', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'muddied', 'glee', 'who', 'find', 'sorrow', 'afterwards.Fortunately', 'audience', 'DAREDEVIL', 'not', 'visual', 'tract', 'philosophy', 'ethics', 'instead', 'visual', 'feast', 'viewer', 'nonstop', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'so', 'top', 'logical', 'flaws', 'get', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'Director', 'Johnson', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'ability', 'make', 'astounding', 'leaps', 'impossible', 'dives', 'not', 'limited', 'hero', 'case', 'hard', 'enough', 'swallow', 'Bullseye', 'Electra', 'have', 'problem', 'performing', 'kind', 'aerial', 'stunts', 'made', 'popular', 'HIDDEN', 'DRAGON', 'CROUCHING', 'TIGER', 'trio', 'ability', 'fly', 'command', 'core', 'viewer', 'interest', 'other', 'nonsense', 'need', 'vengeance', 'window', 'dressing', 'tossed', 'only', 'give', 'break', 'action', 'sequences', 'visual', 'basis', 'alone', 'DAREDEVIL', 'price', 'rental', 'more', 'substantial', 'filmed', 'analyses', 'introspection', 'will', 'not', 'do']",N/A

His use of a web to trapeze around Gotham - and to entrap his opponents - is simultaneously much more graceful and humane.  His ""spidey sense"" and superhuman strength are infinitely more believable as comic hero tools.  And he wins his love's heart the old fashioned way - by saving her life.  Which, unfortunately, even the Daredevil fails to do!Colin Farrell as Bullseye (Daredevil's nemesis) only adds to the movie's callousness.  He murders with pencils and paperclips, as though using innocuous devices somehow makes it ok.And even Jennifer Garner, as Elektra Natchios, is unable to save the day.  Sure, she's gorgeous, and the sonic image of her created in the rain is easily the coolest special effect in the entire film.  But it didn't thrill me to see her stab the man she loves; or to take it herself in the gut!  And you really know something's wrong when the sexiest picture you can remember of her comes -- not from the movie itself - but from the leather-wrapped, rear view photo of her which appears on the DVD's box!According to other reviews I've read, the original Daredevil was only a second-rate comic book superhero - and this movie really shows off why!This is a great film for fans of the genre.

The guys is just way to hyped for my taste, but I must say he was pretty dang good in this movie.Matt Murdock(Affleck) is blind. He's been blind since he was 12 when chemicals were spilled on his face. However, the chemicals changed him. While his sight was gone all of his other senses were strengthed to compensate for the loss of his eyes. Shortly after his accident his dad a boxer was killed after a fight for not throwing it. Matt had promised his dad to do something with his life so Matt does. He goes to law school and becomes a lawyer.Matt runs his own firm in Hells Kitchen with Frank Nelson(Favreau). They look out for the little people and are best friends. Matt fights crime by day as a lawyer, but at night he is the superhero Daredevil who is bring down crime and trying to stop the Kingpin(Duncan).One day Matt comes across a beautiful woman. After a short physical engagement he finds out that the woman is Elektra Natchios(Garner) daughter to a billionaire shipping heir. The two quickly fall for each other, but the Kingpin has declared war on the Natchios family and they aren't safe. The Kingpin has hired Bullseye(Ferrel) to kill them. Know Matt must save the woman he loves before time runs out.The acting in this movie is great. An all star cast was put togther for it. This movie had one of the biggest casts for a movie in 2003 with Affleck, Garner, Duncan, Favreau, Pantoliano, Ferrel, and cameos by Stan Lee and former Daredevil illustrator Kevin Smith. All of them are great in the movie and there isn't anything  to dislike about them. I can't believe Michael Clarke Duncan put on 20 more pounds for his role as the Kingpin. The guy is huge. I liked Jennifer Garner a lot. This woman is gorgeous and I could watch the movie for her alone.The special effects are pretty good. They rival the first Spiderman movie. The costumes are pretty good as are the sets. This really was a well made comic book movie.Daredevil isn't your normal superhero. He's a much darker character.

608320,A1AMR2GU34OVJP,B00005JLXE,Matthew Newland,"[4, 5]","A friend of mine loaned me his copy of &quot;Daredevil&quot; a little while back, and I was actually quite excited to watch it.  I knew next to nothing about Daredevil, save that he was blind and that his other senses worked extra-well to compensate for that fact ... beyond that, I was totally in the dark.  I had recently come off of seeing a pair of comic book adaptations not too long before trying out this one: the excellent &quot;X2: X-Men United&quot; and the pretty good-but-not-quite-as-much-fun &quot;Hulk&quot;, so I was pretty sure I would enjoy this one too.  I was sadly mistaken.To be fair, this film did have a couple things going for it, though one of them is admittedly entirely subjective.  First off, I was interested immediately by the use of Roman Catholicism in relation to the main character.  To be clear, this both interested me and set me on edge ... while I appreciated seeing a character in a movie have the Faith play a notable role in his life, just as it does with mine, it also set me on edge ... I didn't want the church to be portrayed in the wrong way, as it tends to be in movies that I have seen (not in the fact that the Church is insulted, but that the writers' understanding of the Church is sometimes mistaken on a particular point or attitude, which leads to the Church not being properly represented.  I felt the same way when I saw Nightcrawler praying the rosary in &quot;X2&quot;.  Gladly, I had nothing to worry about from him, and Nightcrawler definitely came out as my favorite character of that film).  I felt the Church itself to be well represented in this film ... Daredevil's actions contrary to her teachings, such as the things he does motivated by revenge, were his own choices.  Good enough for me.There were two more things I liked about this film, which helps to merit it two stars rather than just one.  First, the whole childhood of Matt Murdock/origin story episode of the film was enjoyable.  Second, I have to say that Colin Ferrell stole the show as the villainous Bullseye, hamming it up to a most entertaining degree and becoming a true bright spot amid the mindless chaos which surrounded him.  If he had been the star, I would never have considered the movie to be a perfect one, but it would have still been incredibly fun to watch ... like seeing a movie just about the Kurgan from &quot;Highlander&quot;!Now that I've got the good things out of the way, let's take a look at the stuff I remembered most: the bad.First off, there's our main characters.  Murdock and Elektra have got to have the worst possible scenes together out of any cinematic couple I've seen in recent history.  Their meeting in the coffee shop or wherever it is is just awful (and he comes off looking like a major creep, if you ask me), and their little fight on the playground was downright embarrassing (made even worse by the awful one-liners they were forced to spout).  Things don't get any better, and there was certainly no sympathy to be found from me when Elektra ... well, let's not spoil it for those who have not yet seen the movie (though I should still tell you not to bother).I was majorly bewildered and frustrated by Murdock's confession scene after he had 'a bit of fun' with Elektra.  It's one thing not to confess something you aren't sorry for, but if you aren't ... well, shouldn't you be telling the priest about that?  I find it truly distressing that he could be such good friends with a priest and so familiar with the Church and all her practices/disciplines/beliefs and not mention or even think twice about that little detail.  If he had been a non-religious character I wouldn't have given this matter a second thought.What else is wrong with this movie?  There's the awful music (I eagerly await the day when the world realizes that rap is cra ... crud and stop subjecting us to it), hearing the phrase &quot;lawyer by day ...&quot; repeated over and over ad nauseum, the incredible stunts that Daredevil is able to pull off (I actually had to double-check and make sure that he didn't have other superpowers besides his hyperactive senses) ...  If that's really true, I'd like to be able to jump off of buildings the same way he does, and a heck of a lot more.&quot;Daredevil&quot; was a complete waste of time, and has soured me from seeing any more comic book adaptations until the third &quot;X-Men&quot; film comes out in a year or two.  You know it's a bad sign when you find yourself rooting for the bad guy, which we all know will only result in disappointment if we do.  If you haven't seen this yet, give it a miss and do something else, like go to the library or clean your bathroom sink.  You'll have a better time of it, and if you knew what you were missing you would thank me.Carry on Carry on,MN",2,Daredevil can go to ... heck.,1084320000,"05 12, 2004",2004,4790,"['friend', 'mine', 'loaned', 'copy', 'quot', 'Daredevil', 'quot', 'little', 'while', 'back', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'excited', 'watch', 'knew', 'next', 'nothing', 'Daredevil', 'save', 'was', 'blind', 'other', 'senses', 'worked', 'extra-well', 'compensate', 'fact', 'was', 'totally', 'dark', 'had', 'recently', 'come', 'seeing', 'pair', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'before', 'trying', 'out', 'one', 'excellent', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'United', 'quot', 'pretty', 'good-but-not-quite-as-much-fun', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'would', 'enjoy', 'one', 'too', 'was', 'sadly', 'mistaken.To', 'be', 'fair', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'couple', 'things', 'going', 'one', 'admittedly', 'entirely', 'subjective', 'First', 'was', 'interested', 'immediately', 'use', 'Roman', 'Catholicism', 'relation', 'main', 'character', 'be', 'clear', 'interested', 'set', 'edge', 'appreciated', 'seeing', 'character', 'movie', 'have', 'Faith', 'play', 'notable', 'role', 'life', 'just', 'mine', 'also', 'set', 'edge', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'church', 'be', 'portrayed', 'wrong', 'way', 'be', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'not', 'fact', 'Church', 'insulted', 'writers', 'understanding', 'Church', 'sometimes', 'mistaken', 'particular', 'point', 'attitude', 'Church', 'not', 'being', 'properly', 'represented', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'when', 'saw', 'Nightcrawler', 'praying', 'rosary', 'quot', 'X2', 'quot', 'Gladly', 'had', 'nothing', 'worry', 'Nightcrawler', 'definitely', 'came', 'out', 'favorite', 'character', 'film', 'felt', 'Church', 'be', 'well', 'represented', 'film', 'Daredevil', 'actions', 'contrary', 'teachings', 'such', 'things', 'motivated', 'revenge', 'were', 'own', 'choices', 'Good', 'enough', 'me.There', 'were', 'two', 'more', 'things', 'liked', 'film', 'merit', 'two', 'stars', 'rather', 'just', 'one', 'First', 'whole', 'childhood', 'Matt', 'Murdock/origin', 'story', 'episode', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'Second', 'have', 'say', 'Colin', 'Ferrell', 'stole', 'show', 'villainous', 'Bullseye', 'hamming', 'up', 'most', 'entertaining', 'degree', 'becoming', 'true', 'bright', 'spot', 'mindless', 'chaos', 'surrounded', 'had', 'been', 'star', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'considered', 'movie', 'be', 'perfect', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'been', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'watch', 'seeing', 'movie', 'just', 'Kurgan', 'quot', 'Highlander', 'quot', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'good', 'things', 'way', 'let', 'take', 'look', 'stuff', 'remembered', 'most', 'bad.First', 'off', 'main', 'characters', 'Murdock', 'Elektra', 'have', 'got', 'have', 'worst', 'possible', 'scenes', 'together', 'cinematic', 'couple', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'history', 'meeting', 'coffee', 'shop', 'wherever', 'just', 'awful', 'off', 'looking', 'major', 'creep', 'ask', 'little', 'fight', 'playground', 'was', 'downright', 'embarrassing', 'made', 'even', 'worse', 'awful', 'one-liners', 'were', 'forced', 'spout', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'was', 'certainly', 'no', 'sympathy', 'be', 'found', 'when', 'Elektra', 'well', 'let', 'not', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'movie', 'should', 'still', 'tell', 'not', 'bother', '.I', 'was', 'majorly', 'bewildered', 'frustrated', 'Murdock', 'confession', 'scene', 'had', 'bit', 'fun', 'Elektra', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'confess', 'something', 'are', ""n't"", 'sorry', 'are', ""n't"", 'well', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'telling', 'priest', 'find', 'truly', 'distressing', 'could', 'be', 'such', 'good', 'friends', 'priest', 'so', 'familiar', 'Church', 'practices/disciplines/beliefs', 'not', 'mention', 'even', 'think', 'twice', 'little', 'detail', 'had', 'been', 'non-religious', 'character', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'given', 'matter', 'second', 'thought.What', 'else', 'wrong', 'movie', 'awful', 'music', 'eagerly', 'await', 'day', 'when', 'world', 'rap', 'cra', 'crud', 'stop', 'subjecting', 'hearing', 'phrase', 'quot', 'lawyer', 'day', 'quot', 'repeated', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'incredible', 'stunts', 'Daredevil', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'actually', 'had', 'double-check', 'make', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'superpowers', 'hyperactive', 'senses', 'really', 'true', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'able', 'jump', 'buildings', 'same', 'way', 'heck', 'lot', 'more.', 'quot', 'Daredevil', 'quot', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'soured', 'seeing', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'third', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'quot', 'film', 'out', 'year', 'two', 'know', 'bad', 'sign', 'when', 'find', 'rooting', 'bad', 'guy', 'know', 'will', 'only', 'result', 'disappointment', 'do', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'give', 'miss', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'go', 'library', 'clean', 'bathroom', 'sink', ""'ll"", 'have', 'better', 'time', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'missing', 'would', 'thank', 'me.Carry', 'Carry', 'MN']",N/A

They needed to show some more of Daredevil's training and explain about how he got his powers.  What they did show was just insufficient.

Technically, in my opinion, it should be DaredevilMAN (Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc), but they probably thought that was too complex for people to understand.Ben Affleck is really good in this, and he plays the part of a blind guy perfectly! I was a bit sceptical about this, as I wasn't sure it would look right, but by the looks of it, he had contacts in, making him look like he had cataracts or something!Although, he can actually &quot;see&quot; particularly if it's raining, which was kinda weird. The whole scenes where he &quot;sees&quot;, is really very much like the scenes where Keanu Reeves gets blinded in Matrix Revolutions by the nasty guy, and he sees shapes in the fire etc. Well, these scenes are quite similar, although more blue, and nicer.I really Jennifer Garner as a character, although her whole storyline was dropped at one point, for a very good reason. But at the end, it almost seems like she was still around, if you get my drift. (If you've seen the movie, you'll know what I mean!)I didn't like Michael Clarke Duncan as the bad guy in this. After seeing him in movies such as The Green Mile and Armageddon, and others which I forget, he always plays the good guy. He's the big friendly giant, and I just keep seeing him as John Coffey! Everyone knows Michael Clarke Duncan is a bad guy, but he apparently had to gain an additional 40lbs, on top of his usual weight, which would make him pretty heavy! (It doesn't really show, as he looks bigger in Armageddon &amp; The Green Mile)I wasn't sure about Colin Farrell being in this movie. Personally, I don't like the guy, but I'm sure it's the way he's portrayed in the press: doing god-knows-what with Britney Spears,  drinking , smoking, all the things that I find a turn off in a guy. I'm sure he's a perfectly nice guy however. But oh my God, sure he didn't have a lot of lines to learn, but this has to be the first movie I've actually heard him SPEAK in! I've seen trailers for Phone Booth, and believe it or not, all you non-believers out there, the guy is not an American, but he's from Ireland. And he speaks in the most gorgeous 'Orish' accent ever! Shame he didn't have more lines to say, cos I could have listened to him talk all day!If you look closely, you'll see a very surprising person making a cameo! The one and only Kevin Smith! I thought it was him, but he looked different. I think his beard was a lot more trimmed!There's a lot of braille used in the movie, due to the fact that Matt Murdoch is actually blind. The start credits use lights from the skyline to form braille, and then spell out the actors names. Also interesting, the necklace at the end of the movie, also spells out Elektra in braille.Most of the extras look quite good, and I was pleased to finally see the the entire video for Evanescence's &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;. (This was the song that brought them to the attention of the music industry, but another song of theirs &quot;My Immortal&quot;, is used during a funeral scene, adding a whole other dimension to the song. It's one of my faves of their songs, and seeing it played at a funeral scene, is really creepy - the lyrics totally match.) The rest of the extras look good, but basically, you need a chance to actually sit down and view them all. The extras include: audio commentary by director/screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson and producer Gary Foster; &quot;Beyond Hell's Kitchen: Making Daredevil&quot; documentary with optional enhanced viewing mode; Jennifer Garner screen test; 6 multi-angle scene studies; Kingpin featurette; HBO First Look special; &quot;Moving Through Space: A Day with Tom Sullivan&quot;; 3 music videos: &quot;Won't Back Down&quot; by Fuel, &quot;For You&quot; by the Calling, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; by Evanescence; still gallery; &quot;Men Without Fear: Creating Daredevil&quot; documentary; and &quot;Shadow World Tour&quot;: an in-depth look at &quot;Daredevil's sight&quot;.

608326,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B00005JLXE,Michael A. Newman,"[1, 2]","This well-cast movie packs a lot of story into one film.  I remember growing up that Daredevil was always different than other comics after all what other hero was sightless?  Also, the artwork of Gene Colon was much more like the artwork of the Dark Knight versions of Batman that come out in the mid-80's.  The movie had the same feel.  It was a heck of a lot better than the Val Kilmer/George Clooney Batman films but nowhere near the Spiderman movie.As in the comic, Matt Murdock grew up in Hell's Kitchen in lower Manhattan.  His father was a fighter that went against a mob boss and decided not to throw a fight.  He winds up murdered as a result.  Matt is involved in a street accident where some radioactive waste gets in his eyes, removing his sight highly enhancing his other senses.Matt graduates law school and becomes a Legal-aid lawyer for the people of the neighborhood with his pal Foggy Nelson.  The neighborhood crime is being controlled by a powerful mob boss nicknamed, The Kingpin.  Matt, using his enhanced abilities trains himself to become a masked vigilante named Daredevil who tries to thwart the Kingpin's activities (the Kingpin was behind Matt's father's murder).With his business seriously wounded, Kingpin employs a hired assassin called Bullseye.  Bullseye can make a weapon out of any object by throwing it with pinpoint accuracy at his intended victim.Matt meanwhile meets a Greek heiress named Electra.  The two begin dating.  During a business squabble the Kingpin has Bullseye kill Electra's father, causing her to become a vigilante herself set on getting revenge.There is one corny scene where Matt and Electra mix it up in a battle in a children's playground.  It looked like the director wanted to just throw in a scene from The Matrix.I don't want to give too much more of the film away, but if you had followed the storyline in the comics you probably know how the film will turn out.  I know I highly enjoyed this film.  Colin Farrell is phenomenal as Bullseye and Jennifer Garner looks hot as Electra.  The actor who plays Kingpin has been in a lot of movies lately and he had to gain weight to play a convincing Kingpin, which he does well.  The movie will probably not appear to smaller children because of the blood and violence but anyone that liked The Matrix films should really like this one!

608329,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JLXE,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[3, 3]","20th Century Fox has had tremendous success with a previous superhero film, so it was no wonder that they decided to go ahead and start up another franchise. In 2000, X-Men, based on the famous Marvel comic-book superheroes, opened to $54 million and finished with nearly $160 million at the domestic box office. With this success, the trend of superhero films began. Fox has decided to create a film based on another superhero after the tremendous success of Sony's Spider-Man in 2002. Though the character of Daredevil is one of the lesser known comic-book superheroes, Fox is hoping that big names stars like Ben Affleck and rising star Jennifer Garner from ABC's Alias will help bring in a big enough audience to recoup the film's $75 million budget. The studio is also hoping that by placing the film in the month of February, there will be very little competition against the action flick. But will the film version of Daredevil be accepted by the American audience or will the film be blinded by its own hype?The story centers on the life of Matt Murdock. His father, Jack Murdock, is a famous boxer who has fallen from his golden days. One day Matt finds his father robbing a man to make a living for his son and runs from his father. As he runs, Matt gets involved in an accident that robs him of his ability to see. But the chemical that took his sight gave him in exchange a radar-like super sight and heightens the abilities of his other four senses above most normal human beings. Despite his handicap, Matt helps his father rise back to his old form but when his father refuses to take the fall during a fight, he is killed. From that moment, Matt dedicates his life to protecting the innocent and creates the secret identity of Daredevil. Matt's life is complicated enough as a lawyer during the day and Daredevil at night but things become more complex when he meets the beautiful Elektra. As things begin to heat up between Matt and Elektra, the Kingpin has plans for both Elektra and Daredevil as he hires an assassin Bullseye to take care of them both. The story for Daredevil is probably one of the most well-developed comic-book adaptations in quite awhile. It was a wonderful idea to start the film off in the middle of the story then back track to see what events led up to the opening sequence then finish the film off from that moment. It is so rarely done so well in most films today that it was a great delight. The only problem that can be seen with the plot is that some moments can only truly be understood if one was a fan of the comic-book series but those moments are few and aren't of huge importance to the overall effect of the film.The cast for Daredevil is very well put together and most, if not all, seem to work exceedingly well portraying their character within the course of the film. Ben Affleck, who has starred in such action flicks as Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and The Sum of All Fears, is definitely becoming a rising star in Hollywood especially as he seems to be taking more serious roles such as this film. Affleck portrays the character very well and seems to have fun with role as well. Jennifer Garner, who appeared in Catch Me If You Can in December 2002, does a much better job at showing her acting ability on the big screen then the previously mentioned role. Some would prefer that there be more character development with Elektra but outside of that, there really isn't much to complain about. Colin Farrell, who is making appearances in a lot of films throughout 2003, is absolutely amazing as the villain, Bullseye. He does a wonderful job at creating a character that will freak out the audience, which is what his character is supposed to do. Farrell creates a wonderful character that is humorous and frightening at the same time. Despite some criticism, Michael Clark Duncan is great as the Kingpin. It can be said that there could have been someone else better for the role but Duncan, who is usually know for his dramatic roles in such films as The Green Mile, does a delightful job despite that.Overall, Daredevil continues the trend of delightful film adaptations of comic-book superheroes and rises above all its predecessors. The story was fabulously well done and ends in a way that leaves the audience guessing at what happens. The ending should build much anticipation for a Daredevil sequel if there is to be one. With the good there is also the bad. The slow motion techniques used in the fight sequences of the film got annoying after awhile and seemed pretty pointless and unnecessary within points of the film. Another problem with the film was the time length. The feature felt too short and more could have been explained with the course of the film but better to leave some things unanswered for the sequel. In the end, though, those small problems with Daredevil seem trivial. Daredevil is delightful treat and goes beyond the expectancy of most films released during this slow period at the box office.",4,The Moose Hole - One 'Devil' of a Film,1072569600,"12 28,

608331,AXURKQ6N6QS35,B00005JLXE,Miss Jenny,"[0, 1]","""Daredevil"" is an excellent action movie circling around the story of Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), who was left blind as a child when radioactive waste sloped over his eyes - but the same waste which took his eyesight granted him superhuman sharpness - and all his other senses are haywire. He eventually learns to adapt to his new gift, by ""kung-fooing"" and learning to defend himself with the use of his other senses. As an adult, he's a successful lawyer in the small neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, by night, he's the dark, aerobatic vigilant known as Daredevil, who silently brings justice to the streets of New York. He meets and falls in with love with the lovely martial arts master Elektra Natchios (Excellently portrayed by the very talented Jennifer Garner) - who thinks not so highly about Daredevil after she comes to think that he killed her father - when it was really the assassin-for-hire Bullseye (A wonderful performance by Colin Farrell), who was sent by the evil Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan, who, unfortunately, is badly cast), who has also sent other people to be murdered. Once Daredevil finds out that Kingpin is the culprit, he must face him and Bullseye in a final showdown - in an attempt to complete his vow of bringing justice to his city.Personally, I enjoyed ""Daredevil"" a lot - and I was quite surprised because I really expected it to be like ""The Phantom"" with Billy Zane - a flop and a cheap imitation of ""Spider-Man"". And it wasn't like that at all! I also didn't have much anticipation for Ben Affleck's performance, and it wasn't bad - it was actually very good and he had a lot of physical potential. Oh - and I loved Jennifer Garner. She was a great leading lady. She's definitely bringing on the girl power to the movie. Colin Farrell was so good, I think he stole the show. He was evil. Pure evil. Though I can't say much of Michael Clark Duncan, it really looked as if he wasn't really enjoying the role. He didn't sound or even look evil. The special effects were a teensy-weensy too fake for my taste, but they were fine. I also think that they should've laid off the rock music. It was just annoying to hear people talk and hearing some rock band singing in the background when there isn't even a radio in the scene. This movie was not for that type of scenario. The story and directing were great! It was orginial, on track and very darn good- - bravo for Mr. Johnson.In conclusion, ""Daredevil"" is yet another great adoption of a comic book.

The Razzies nominated Affleck for worst actor but the nomination was unjustified. The budget for this film was $79M and made just a tad under $180M at the Box Office. Even though it did well there were a number of attempts to continue with the franchise but too many obstacles have yet to produce Daredevil 2. All said, a refresh to Daredevil is in the works and that's the main reason I watched this film again. SPOILERS: Elektra should have known she was fighting Matt long before she removed his mask; the fight scene between Matt and Elektra looked cool but a blind guy fighting it out publicly in front of a ton of kids is going to get passed around and then the secret identity is revealed. Woops. If his opponents knew that extreme noises would stun Daredevil why didn't they use them to great impact at the end of the film rather than fighting off? Those dudes weren't exactly chivalrous in combat.

608333,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B00005JLXE,mitchell5954,"[1, 1]","Daredevil, in my opinion, is a much underrated superhero film and film in general.  Plus, Ben Affleck gets much undeserved hate for this film, which I do not understand.  I admit, when I first saw this film years ago I did not like it either.  I think the reason why people (myself included) reacted negatively when they saw it is because the film when through many changes from its original version before coming to theatres.  Many scenes were cut out and a few scenes were put in a different order making the film very disjointed.  What most people do not know is that the original version of the film that the director wanted was released to DVD and is called the Director&#8217;s Cut.  Unfortunately only diehard fans really know of this version.  I wish that this film was re-aired in theatres in its original version.  If that happens people might see this movie in a new light.  The Director&#8217;s Cut is the definitive version (in my opinion) and is the version I will be reviewing.  I have not seen the theatrical version in a very long time and do not remember it much at all.  I am also not too knowledgeable on the Daredevil comics so I will not be making too many comparisons.I have almost no problems with this film.  I have a couple issues but they are minor.  First of all, the cast is top notch.  Despite the popular opinion, I think Ben Affleck does a great job as Matt Murdock/Daredevil.  Playing a superhero is always hard for anyone because you are essentially playing to people.  Affleck has to capture Matt Murdock in his normal life and his normal job and when he is in the costume.  I do not know how accurate he is to the comic version, but in terms of the film itself he really sold me.  Jennifer Gardener was the perfect choice for Electra.  However, one of my issues has to do with her.The villains were also very well cast.  Colin Farrell killed it as Bullseye.  I think this is easily one of Farrell&#8217;s best performances if not his best.  Plus, Bullseye is one of my favorite characters in the movie because he is just so fun to watch.  Michael Clarke Duncan also plays a great Kingpin.  He may not be accurate to the comic version (in terms of the look), but he does such a great job that I do not care.  May he rest in peace.The film also looks great.  The style and atmosphere of the film really draw you in.  The score and soundtrack are also well-done.  The fights are exciting especially the ones involving Bullseye.  However, some of it looks a bit fake, which is mostly due to the effects.  The majority of the effects look good but some look a little dated.For the most part the film is paced very well.  Although there is this one subplot about this guy on trial being framed for murder and Murdock trying to bail him out that went on a bit too long.  I know it is to show more of Murdock in his job as an attorney, but I still think it went on a bit too long.I do have a couple issues.  Most of them I have already stated.  I stated how some of the effects looked dated and the subplot of the man being framed going on too long.  However, my biggest issue is with Electra.  (SPOILER) Electra dies near the end of the film.  My problem is that you see very little of her fighting.  For most of the film her character is just the love interest for Murdock.  It isn&#8217;t until the end of the film that we finally see her fight like she did in the comics.  She has a short fight with Daredevil and then dies.  That&#8217;s it!  I know she dies in the comics, but I wish they would have saved that for the sequel (if there was one).Overall, Daredevil is probably one of the most underrated superhero movies out there.  I highly recommend this version of the film.  Do not see the theatrical version.

This year, we have had (or will have) ""X2,"" ""The Hulk,"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.""  But buried beneath them, is ""Daredeveil,"" a frenetic, eye-catching spectacle, but with enough heart and humor to help rise above it rumored shallowness.  Key to the movies' success is Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, who hits the right amount of brood and anger as ""The Man with no Fear.""  I would say that ""Daredevil"" reasserted my confidence in Affleck as a good actor.As a boy, Matt Murdock is blinded by a chemical waste accident, but his other senses functioned at superhuman levels, more than making up for his lack of sight.  As a man, he is a determined lawyer representing the downtrodden in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York.  At night, he wages a secret war against crime as Daredevil, a red-leather clad superhero.  His new enemy is the rumored Kingpin (an imposing Michael-Clark Duncan), one man who controls all the crime in New York.  At his disposal, Kingpin has a legion of criminals, most dangerous is the gleefully evil Bullseye (a delicious Colin Farrel) who can turn any object into a lethal projectile.  Caught up in the middle is Elecktra (a beautiful Jennifer Garner) who develops a relationship with Murdock and her doomed father (Erik Avari).Even though ""Daredevil"" is a satisfying action movie, it does leave room for improvement for its inevitable sequels.  The characters could use a little more development, and the story could use a little tightening.  Also, was the play-fight between Murdock and Elecktra in the playground necessary?  I don't know.  To me, it seemed a little shallow as it balantly goes for eye-filling candy, instead of a little substance.

He plays the title role. And causes no room for complain here. Colin Farrell plays the villian Bullseye. And although he wasn't on screen as much as you might think, he was quite a presence when he was. Now Jennifer Garner was a scene stealer as Elektra. She was worth the price of addmission alone. Rounding out the immpessive cast is Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin. I've heard others say he's about as scary as a giant teddybear. Well he is a great actor in my opionion and I thought he played the role very well. Once again not on screen as much as I expected.

The Darker, grittier, edgirer, but better version of Mark Steven Johnson's adaption of Stan Lee's comic book character Daredevil. Having being  30 minutes longer than its crappier theatrical release, This 133-minute Director's Cut of Daredevil offers more story, better preformances by actors and actresses (especially by Joe Pantoliano [Ben Urich], and Jon Favreau [Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson]), and a whole subplot that was cut out by the executives at 20th Century Fox (wanted to keep a PG-13 rating and wanted it under 100 minutes).Personally, I thought Fox was being stupid by cutting out the subplot in which Matt Murdock (Daredevil) agrees to defend a man (Coolio) framed for murder. Here in this cut of the film, it shows you how Mr. Murdock deals in the court of law more efficently.I can see how parts like the confessionals and the love scene were not included in the Director's Cut. They were needed to make a crappier theatrical release of this movie, which could have been bigger and better. Althought it's rated 14A in Canada, an MPAA rating of ""R"" dosen't really go with me. I mean it's not a graphic cut, but it is a darker cut. And there is really only two or three parts of language (especially the part of Bullseye saying ""I want a f***ing costume"" rather than ""I want a bloody costume"").Despite the negative remarks about the rating, and the lack of special features (which only has a commentary and a 15-minute featurette), I still give it a 5-star rating. It's a much better film adaption of the comic book. At least Fox was smart by releasing this Director's Cut (or better version of this film) of Daredevil.",5,"""More Action... More Excitment...

608341,A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ,B00005JLXE,"Mr. JKW ""jkw""","[2, 4]","""Daredevil"" brings to the big screen Marvel's Red-Suited Horned protector of New York's Hell's Kitchen.  Action and FX enthusiasts will be pleased with this flick and fans of the comic books, despite a few discrepancies from the comics, should also be pleased with Hollywood's rendering of their hero.THE STORY:As a child Matt Murdock is blinded in an accident.  After losing his sight his other four remaining senses become razor sharp and he acquires a type of ""radar sense"" that helps him ""see"" his surroundings.  (All of which are awesomely depicted in the film!!)  After  his father's murder Matt grows up with a strong sense of getting justice on the evildoers in the world.  He grows up as the dichotomy of justice, working as a lawyer by day as attorney Matt Murdock, and by night as the costumed Man Without Fear, the vigilante Daredevil, who seeks to obtain justice from those who sometimes slips through the legal system's cracks.THE FILM:Many will naturally compare this film to Horn-Head's (more popular) colleague Spider-Man.  Matched against Spider-Man, action and comic fans will be equally pleased with Daredevil.  The story in this movie is infinitely darker than with Spider-Man (Daredevil is actually better compared to his DC rival Batman) but the action and effects are (arguably) perhaps superior to the Spider-Man film.THE COOL THINGS:The depictions of Daredevil's ""Radar Sense"" are just way cool and the action scenes with Elektra and Bullseye are among the best anywhere.The filmography of the movie was also awesome.  One of the coolest scenes was actually the opening credits which featured the New York skyline morphing into Braille which then morphed to the cast and crew names.  Nice touch!!!As a fan of the comic I was very pleased with the portrayals of the characters.  The scriptwriters did a nice job of capturing the dichotomy of the Matt Murdock character and the pure sinisterness of the Kingpin and Bullseye characters as well as the troubled soul of the Elektra character.  Hats off to the cast and crew for putting together a fine movie.NITPICKING:The big obvious flaw to the movie was the casting of the Kingpin character.  Any Marvel fan can quickly tell you that the Kingpin was a huge White guy and not a huge Black guy.  In the end though, this detail becomes minor as Michael Clarke Duncan did a SUPERB job with the role.BEST SCENES:1. Matt's duel with Elektra2. ANYTHING with Bullseye (his scenes stole the show,  hilarious as well as action packed)3. Matt and Elektra in the rain (something about superheroes, women and rain huh?)4. Anything with the ""Radar Sense""THE VERDICT:The Jury says you should definitely check out this flick whether you're an action fan, comic fan or just a movie fan in general.Highly Recommended",5,Not Your Friendly Neighborhood Super Hero Movie&#65533;,1046995200,"03 7, 2003",2003,2772,"['Daredevil', 'big', 'screen', 'Marvel', 'Red-Suited', 'Horned', 'protector', 'New', 'York', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'Action', 'FX', 'enthusiasts', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'flick', 'fans', 'comic', 'books', 'few', 'discrepancies', 'comics', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'pleased', 'Hollywood', 'rendering', 'hero.THE', 'STORY', 'child', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'blinded', 'accident', 'losing', 'sight', 'other', 'four', 'remaining', 'senses', 'become', 'razor', 'sharp', 'type', 'radar', 'sense', 'see', 'surroundings', 'are', 'awesomely', 'depicted', 'film', 'father', 'murder', 'Matt', 'up', 'strong', 'sense', 'getting', 'justice', 'evildoers', 'world', 'up', 'dichotomy', 'justice', 'working', 'lawyer', 'day', 'attorney', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'night', 'costumed', 'Man', 'Fear', 'vigilante', 'Daredevil', 'who', 'obtain', 'justice', 'who', 'sometimes', 'legal', 'system', 'cracks.THE', 'FILM', 'Many', 'will', 'naturally', 'compare', 'film', 'Horn-Head', 'more', 'popular', 'colleague', 'Spider-Man', 'Matched', 'Spider-Man', 'action', 'comic', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'equally', 'pleased', 'Daredevil', 'story', 'movie', 'infinitely', 'darker', 'Spider-Man', 'Daredevil', 'actually', 'better', 'compared', 'DC', 'rival', 'Batman', 'action', 'effects', 'are', 'arguably', 'perhaps', 'superior', 'Spider-Man', 'film.THE', 'COOL', 'THINGS', 'depictions', 'Daredevil', 'Radar', 'Sense', 'are', 'just', 'way', 'cool', 'action', 'scenes', 'Elektra', 'Bullseye', 'are', 'best', 'anywhere.The', 'filmography', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'awesome', 'One', 'coolest', 'scenes', 'was', 'actually', 'opening', 'credits', 'featured', 'New', 'York', 'skyline', 'morphing', 'Braille', 'then', 'morphed', 'cast', 'crew', 'names', 'Nice', 'touch', 'fan', 'comic', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'portrayals', 'characters', 'scriptwriters', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'capturing', 'dichotomy', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'character', 'pure', 'sinisterness', 'Kingpin', 'Bullseye', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'troubled', 'soul', 'Elektra', 'character', 'cast', 'crew', 'putting', 'together', 'fine', 'movie.NITPICKING', 'big', 'obvious', 'flaw', 'movie', 'was', 'casting', 'Kingpin', 'character', 'Marvel', 'fan', 'can', 'quickly', 'tell', 'Kingpin', 'was', 'huge', 'White', 'guy', 'not', 'huge', 'Black', 'guy', 'end', 'detail', 'minor', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'did', 'SUPERB', 'job', 'role.BEST', 'SCENES:1', 'Matt', 'duel', 'Elektra2', 'ANYTHING', 'Bullseye', 'scenes', 'stole', 'show', 'hilarious', 'as', 'well', 'action', 'packed', '3', 'Matt', 'Elektra', 'rain', 'something', 'superheroes', 'women', 'rain', 'huh', '4', 'Anything', 'Radar', 'Sense', 'VERDICT', 'Jury', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'flick', ""'re"", 'action', 'fan', 'comic', 'fan', 'just', 'movie', 'fan', 'general.Highly', 'Recommended']",N/A

I will admit that there are some moments in the film that were pretty good, like the fight sequences between Affleck's and Garner's characters. Other than that, I didn't really find the movie all that interesting.The ubiquitous Colin Farrell gives an odd performance as Bullseye, a killer who never misses his mark. After a while I became a little annoyed with his character's fidgeting. I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and just tell him to be still! I also was not impressed by Michael Clarke Duncan's performace as Kingpin. Duncan usually always gives a great performance in his other work, but it seemed as though he was merely cast in this film because of his size and the fact that he can be scary just by taking off his jacket. Ben Affleck gave a sympathetic performance as Murdock/Daredevil, but most of the time he seemed mostly wooden.All in all, I would suggest this film to comic book buffs who like a good dose of action from their favorite stories.

The idea of taking such a great comic character and trying to package it for global appeal just really grated my nerves.  However, after watching it for a second time, I have come to grown a bit of a liking for it.  Ben Affleck isn't bad at all as Matt Murdock who is lawyer by day and Daredevil by night.  Jennifer Garner is nicely cast as Elektra, and Colin Farrell nearly steals the entire film as Bullseye.  Director/screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson is a self admitted fan of the Daredevil comic (as is star Affleck) and it shows; the showdown between Elektra and Bullseye is almost directly taken from the classic issue of Daredevil #181, plus Marvel comics trivia knowledge is peppered all throughout the film, plus cameos from Marvel icon Stan Lee, writer Kevin Smith (yes, it's Silent Bob himself who goes by the name Jack Kirby in the film, named after another Daredevil alumnus), and the man who forever re-defined the comic series (and whose run on the series the film is seemingly mostly based from) Frank Miller.  While Daredevil does have it's share of good qualities, the film seems to have an uneven flow sometimes, Michael Clarke Duncan is miscast as the Kingpin (and no, it's not because he's black), the computer generated visual effects seem half heartedly put together, and the way the film ends just opens the door for a sequel and an Elektra spin off.  All that aside however, Daredevil didn't deserve all the bashing I gave it earlier, and longtime fans of the comic will appreciate most of the heart that went into the film, but might not like the complete package.  The DVD itself is nicely put together and the bonus featurettes featuring interviews with Stan Lee, Frank Miller, Brian Michael Bendis, Kevin Smith, and others is a must watch for long time Daredevil fans as well.",3,Better than I had given it credit for,1060128000,"08 6, 2003",2003,1889,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'Daredevil', 'months', 'ago', 'theaters', 'bashed', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'idea', 'taking', 'such', 'great', 'comic', 'character', 'trying', 'package', 'global', 'appeal', 'just', 'really', 'grated', 'nerves', 'However', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'have', 'come', 'grown', 'bit', 'liking', 'Ben', 'Affleck', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'who', 'lawyer', 'day', 'Daredevil', 'night', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'nicely', 'cast', 'Elektra', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'nearly', 'steals', 'entire', 'film', 'Bullseye', 'Director/screenwriter', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'self', 'admitted', 'fan', 'Daredevil', 'comic', 'star', 'Affleck', 'showdown', 'Elektra', 'Bullseye', 'almost', 'directly', 'taken', 'classic', 'issue', 'Daredevil', '181', 'Marvel', 'comics', 'trivia', 'knowledge', 'peppered', 'film', 'cameos', 'Marvel', 'icon', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'writer', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'yes', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'who', 'name', 'Jack', 'Kirby', 'film', 'named', 'Daredevil', 'alumnus', 'man', 'who', 'forever', 're-defined', 'comic', 'series', 'run', 'series', 'film', 'seemingly', 'mostly', 'based', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Daredevil', 'have', 'share', 'good', 'qualities', 'film', 'have', 'uneven', 'flow', 'sometimes', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'miscast', 'Kingpin', 'not', 'black', 'computer', 'generated', 'visual', 'effects', 'seem', 'half', 'heartedly', 'put', 'together', 'way', 'film', 'just', 'door', 'sequel', 'Elektra', 'spin', 'off', 'aside', 'however', 'Daredevil', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'bashing', 'gave', 'earlier', 'longtime', 'fans', 'comic', 'will', 'appreciate', 'most', 'heart', 'went', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'complete', 'package', 'DVD', 'nicely', 'put', 'together', 'bonus', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Brian', 'Michael', 'Bendis', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'others', 'must', 'watch', 'long', 'time', 'Daredevil', 'fans', 'as', 'well']",N/A

More movies are coming out, and the most recent one is Daredevil. Not as mainstream to non-comic fans as Spider-Man and Batman (more than likely because DD never had his own show), Daredevil is a very dark comic movie, unlike X-Men and Spider-Man, but like the original Batman and Spawn.Now, I am NOT an Affleck fan. I don't have anything aganist him, but I'm not a fan, and I wasn't as excited about this movie as I was for X-Men and Spider-Man, because I'm not used to Daredevil (for reasons suggested above), and because Ben Affleck. He seems like the last person to do Daredevil. Let's just hope Seann William Scott isn't really The Hulk...Now the story, even though I'm not sure how true it is to the original comic: 12-year old Matt Murdoc lives with his pro-boxer father in Hell's Kitchen. Well, one day Matt takes a short cut through a chemical site, and sees his dad harassing a man. In a state of confusion and anger, Matt runs off, and is blinded by a chemical spilled out of a can into his eyes. But, frm his blindness, gains super-human powers to his remaining senses. His dad is killed later by Kingpin, the man who seemingly runs all crime in New York. He vows to keep the city safe for the rest of his life, and becomes Daredevil.Now, in Daredevil there are two main villians: the highly entertaining Bullseye (who dies way too soon), and a black Kingpin, who I can remember from an appearence in a Spider-Man cartoon.I reccomend this if you are just looking for a good action movie, or are a comic book nut, or if you're overly obsessed with Ben Affleck.

I think he played a blind man well.  He really did justice to  the MURDOCK/DAREDEVIL character.  And he really looked like daredevil in the outfit like in the comic books.  His on-screen chemistry with Electra was great.  I'm  skepical when they change genders or races of characters but the african american actor who played KINGPIN really gave a cool twist to the character and made him more interesting.  in the comic, KINGPIN just seems to be this rich, blobby fat white guy who is just plain greedy and without scruples.  BULLSEYE was an awesome villian and Colin Farrell played him great!!  the movie is fast moving and cut to the chase with the origin.(unlike the HULK, where you sat there watching saying to yourself ""when's something interesting gonna happen?"" in the 1st 35 minutes of the film!)  The star and all supporting characters/actors fit very well in the story.  effects on how Daredevil's ""radar"" worked was really kool.  I actally think the movie is action packed and is a positive story about a poor kid who even got a harder blow in life by becoming blind, yet, learns to adapt to the world blindly with his new ""radar"", has to suffer the brutal loss of his father yet, stills works to get out of ""hell's kitchen"", becomes a lawyer PLUS gets to become a super hero and finally everything comes full circle when he goes head to head with his father's killer the kingpin and finally brings him to justice.  It's a really good movie portaying a man who reached his goals dispite the obsticles life had handed him..I think it's great a longer R Rated version is being released---a whole half hour more of movie  is  BONUS MATERIAL there!

But I did know who he was and who the characters are. This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be. The thing that shocked me the most was how dark this movie is. I can't believe it got away with a PG-13 rating. There's one scene in a bar where the music in the background uses very foul language while Bullseye is murdering a guy. This comes as a pleasant surprise to me as an adult but I worry about parents who take their young kids to see this movie about a super hero is a vigilante. The only thing I really did not like about DD was some of the action scenes. They used wire to help balance the actors and also allow them to make jumps that are not possible. That's fine but they did a horrible job making it look realistic. When a character jumps from one building to another it's as if they are landing on a cloud and they just keep on running before their feet even touch ground.

First of all, like some have mentioned, it is very dark (maybe that's what I liked about it).... the background itself, &amp; the subject matter.  I'm not familiar with the comic book, so this is totally based on viewing the movie.  It's certainly not as happy-go-lucky as Spiderman, so if you're expecting that, it might disappoint.  There are some rather sad things that happen in the movie, but afterwards, I'm thinking, well, I did keep watching it.... &amp; even though most people like &amp; expect happy endings, the fact is that life is not full of them.  You can actually feel the pain of the characters... so in that respect, I didn't mind so much that it didn't have a totally happy &amp; predictable ending.  The visual effects are cool of course, &amp; the music is good too.As far as the acting, I don't think you have to be a huge Ben Affleck fan to appreciate it... I'm saying that cuz yah, I'm REALLY sick of the whole J-Lo thing, but don't let that keep you from seeing him act.  He's not bad... I've only seen him in Kevin Smith movies like Dogma, so it was nice to see him do another character.  And speaking of Dogma, it's interesting that Kevin Smith was involved in this... I'm sure that contributed to my appreciation for this film.  I haven't even seen Garner &amp; Farrell at work, &amp; I think they both did a good job too.  They made Garner look really lovely, &amp; I thought her outfit she wore on the cover/fight was really cool.  Farrell was a really good villain, &amp; he fit the part almost too well.A few downsides:  yah, the playground scene was kinda too Matrix-ish like someone said, but I think it can be overlooked.  And like I said earlier, some of the events that are down right sad might be aggravating to some cuz sometimes they were a little drawn out...even I was thinking at times &quot;geez, could his luck get any worse?&quot;  But it kinda reminds me of listening to depressing music, as I often do...if you don't mind the reality of it, it might actually make you feel better... or maybe I'm just weird like that.  All in all, I actually agree with the reviewer rating here of 3 &amp; 1/2 stars, but since I had to pick, I give it a 4... just going with the majority, &amp; I'm in a good mood.  If you like other super-hero/vigilante movies like Batman, Spiderman, &amp; The Crow, you'll be able to appreciate this as well.

There was absolutely nothing wrong with Ben Affleck's performance and the rest of the cast did an amazing job.Daredevil had an edge to it more so than Spiderman which was mainly focused at a child/teenage audience. This movie offers darker themes and covers greater areas. It explores the fine line between justice and vengeance, brutality, revenge, corruption, love and religion.This movie did have a lot ground to cover in 90 mins such as Daredevil's origin and setting up the rest of the characters involved: Bullseye, Elektra and the KingPin. So you did grasp this understanding through the course of the film.I thought the costumes were faithful to the comics although I didn't think much of Daredevil's mask which lacked a neck. It looked more like a ""cap"" and earlier on in the film (Subway Scene) more like a bandana. It does get a little anoying watching this especially since Spiderman's costume was so dead on with his comic book roots. They mentioned they didn't want Daredevil's costume to resemble Spiderman's but come on how can they possibly mistake Daredevil's image for Spidey???The final scene with Daredevil and Kingpin was a little rushed but they were trying to set up the sequel by ending the movie in this way. I honestly hope we do manage to get a sequel as there are just too many unanswered questions left over from this film that need to be resolved.Overall a striking movie with a lot of vision and I am certain this Directors Cut will be an even deeper experience since he was forced to edit and omit scenes to obtain a PG 13 rating.

But Daredevil still is a good comic book film that wins much of my praise by being true to the page in creating a very dark character in a harsh worldStill, it is not without its flaws, and if it weren't for some very unique traits I would rate this film as only mediocre. But what works here works exceptionally well. Beginning with the traditional origin story of Daredevil (Ben Affleck), a blind superhero whose remaining senses are greatly heightened, the movie shows how he became a vengeful vigilante who kills the bad guys rather then turning them in to face a potentially corrupt court system (Daredevil's alter ego Matt Murdock is a lawyer by day). This world is mean, and so is its superhero. But he wrestles with his conscious and wonders if he is a bad guy too. In this comic book world, people die. Including those you don't expect to. In other words, it more accurately depicts real life while still in a superhero world.One particular unique thing about the film is how it illustrates Daredevil's radar sense. The vibrations he picks up are shown in a fantastic visual effect that has to be one of the best film realizations of a superpower in history. From the origin scene when he goes blind to a wonderful scene with Elecktra in the rain where he first ""sees"" what she looks like from the drops of rain on her face, the technique is used for characterization and ""film moments,"" and never just to show off a cool special effect.Unfortunately, the movie isn't perfect. There isn't enough development of Elecktra and Daredevil's relationship, and bad guy Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan) doesn't have enough screentime to villainify his presence. All the characters could have benefited from further characterization as well. But this is a comic book movie, after all, and in the end what matters most is how much fun it was.

Or maybe it should be Jennifer Garner and Mark Stephen Johnson.  Well, whoever's responsible for the crap-tastic versions of Elektra and Bullseye, they're responsible for the lameness of ""Daredevil.""Jennifer Garner is just not a good actress.  She looks nice, but that's it.  Her portrayal of Elektra was such a deviation from the original character; she's too outgoing, too nice, too kind-hearted.  She's Greek, but she can't even speak to her father in their native language, even when he speaks it to her?  She also talks too much.  And couldn't they have at least dyed her hair black?  This is like making Jean Grey a blonde; you don't do it.Maybe Colin Farrell isn't to blame for Bullseye's failure; maybe he was just doing as directed.  Either way, he took an already cinematic character from the comics and made him so incredibly generic.  Bullseye's cocky and talkative; Farrell was soft-spoken and had an accent (Don't try to tell me he can't fake an American accent.  ""Phone Booth"").  I understand that the comic book version of Bullseye wore a silly spandex outfit that wouldn't look good on film, but couldn't they have done better than a trench coat?  Go play ""The Punisher"" video game that came out in 2005 to see a perfect representation of Bullseye that would have worked for the film.  To bad Garth Ennis didn't work on this film.I'm interested in seeing Director's Cut, but I see no way it will change my opinion on the failings of these two characters.

The choice of removing the love seen with Elektra seemed to turn into cliche, where the original version was a nice change from the usual all-sacrificing hero. The sub-plot of the murder, while showing more of the lawyer side of Matt Murdock, didn't seem that inspired and didn't seem to serve the core story (just complicate it).It would have been nice to see Bullseye introduced while breaking out of prison, headaches and all, and to have saved a Kingpin showdown for a sequel, letting the Bulleye showdown really serve as an immediate climax to the events with Elektra.The cast was excellent and I found myself enjoying Affleck as Daredevil -- definitely my favorite role of his to date. Garner, while not particularly Greek, did a good job, and Favreau was simply outstanding. Farrel was neither here nor there, over the top but not particularly dangerous.The CGI problems with the virtual Daredevil remain from the theatrical release, but the movie looks great as a whole, and while I didn't find this version better, I found it overall to be just as good as the theatrical release and definitely something worth adding to the collection.",4,Double Dare,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,1586,"['was', 'never', 'huge', 'Daredevil', 'fan', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'run', 'title', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'did', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Daredevil', 'movie', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'director', 'cut.In', 'short', 'version', 'problems', 'had', 'original', 'way', 'were', 'introduces', 'others.I', 'liked', 'initial', 'violence', 'Kingping', 'served', 'increase', 'threat', 'level', 'considerably', 'choice', 'removing', 'love', 'seen', 'Elektra', 'seemed', 'turn', 'cliche', 'where', 'original', 'version', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'usual', 'all-sacrificing', 'hero', 'sub-plot', 'murder', 'showing', 'more', 'lawyer', 'side', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'inspired', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'serve', 'core', 'story', 'just', 'complicate', '.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'Bullseye', 'introduced', 'breaking', 'prison', 'headaches', 'have', 'saved', 'Kingpin', 'showdown', 'sequel', 'letting', 'Bulleye', 'showdown', 'really', 'serve', 'immediate', 'climax', 'events', 'Elektra.The', 'cast', 'was', 'excellent', 'found', 'enjoying', 'Affleck', 'Daredevil', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'role', 'date', 'Garner', 'not', 'particularly', 'Greek', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Favreau', 'was', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'Farrel', 'was', 'neither', 'here', 'there', 'top', 'not', 'particularly', 'dangerous.The', 'CGI', 'problems', 'virtual', 'Daredevil', 'remain', 'theatrical', 'release', 'movie', 'great', 'whole', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'version', 'better', 'found', 'overall', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'theatrical', 'release', 'definitely', 'something', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection']",N/A

Typical of comic book yarn, father, giftedly played by David Keith, is murdered.  Young son Matt is left alone, blind, and vengeful.  He uses his other senses to ""see"" with sound vibrations.  He becomes skilled in martial arts and acrobatics.  Suprisingly believable.  I enjoyed the PG13 version, but felt this version is much tighter and darker.  There is a whole scenerio involving Coolio that got cut originally, and felt it added to the story.  I do feel that Kingpin, brilliantly done by Michael Clarke Duncon, was underused and was worthy of having the villainous role all to his own.  Bullseye, played smartassy by Colin Farrell could have been a chief villain as well instead as a supporting player.  Electra was in the film far too short, but will be spun off to her own movie.  On a side note I was a little disappointed that there was no ""Electra"" trailer considering the film comes out in January.  It would have been nice to include a free pass for it too.

608367,ABWHLZFEM5SZY,B00005JLXE,R. Jensen,"[0, 0]","I had heard much negativity about this movie, but the moment I saw the trailer for this I became hooked. Took me awhile but I finally viewed the film and boy was it a fun and affecting ride. This was the first movie, in a long time that resulted in vertually every emotion happening to me, laughter, anger, nervousness, sorrow, happiness, confusion and shock. And this was purely because of the theatrical cut. Once I viewed the complete picture in the director's cut, I felt happy that I saw the truer version of the picture and that I got gotten all I could from the movie.Daredevil, first struck as awesome due to, the father and son relationship. It was a pairing I truely cared about and I was really sad when Matt's father died. The dark tone of the movie, was perfect for me, negative, real like and identifiable. Unlike most I didn't fully understand the character of Daredevil and this movie and Ben Affleck helped  me to achieve that understanding, both as a lawyer and as a superhero. As you probubly guessed I enjoyed Affleck's preformence.The other actors I felt all did their roles perfectly, though most lost some of their best scenes in the theatrical cut. Duncan rocked as the Kingpin and I personally feel, making him black made the character smarter and more menacing. Jennifer Garner was amazing as Elektra, the chemistry between her and Affleck was amazing. This was the first superhero romance that I actually wanted to be together (unlike spiderman, superman, most batman movies and captain america). Bullseye truely was evil and I got lots of menace from him. Everyone else I loved.Many parts of the movie really affected me, the funeral, the death scenes, the church fight, the final battle and the ending. A movie that can make it so I feel stabbed when Elektra gets stabbed, is definutly a powerful movie. Also the film introduced me to Evanescence and a few of their best songs.I won't mention weakness's with the theatrical cut, but I will mention the DC's problems. Removing the confussionals between Matt and the preist, one weakenss the preists character and makes him a nobody, two makes Matt's vigilante arch les meaningful along with Matt's 2nd to last speech ""I also saved myself"" and finally makes his knowing of Matt's identity useless.I feel the order of Bullseye's scenes should be changed, first the airport metal detector, then the plane ride, the bar, throwing a pen into Frank Miller's head and then the battle. Doing the bar first now doesn't work, as he still has the beanne on at the airport, when he didn't pick it up.With parts of his vigilante arch removed, I feel Daredevil's sparing of the Kingpin, makes less sense in this version, instead of the theatrical, where that arch was the main focus.Also the bitts dealing with Matt's religion or the scenes that try to mention his mother, I feel shouldn't be here.But those aren't that much of a problem for me, as this movie will always hold a soft spot for me, due to how powerful it was. Even though I bought the blu-ray I'm keeping my dvd's, as the commentaries are different (it was actually the first commentary I ever listened the entire way thorugh).Of course my enjoyment doesn't completly overhsadow the faults this movie does have so I'll give it 4/5. And also this movie has a novelization.

Fans of the comic were disdainful of the casting choices, Ben Affleck was in a paparazzi mess with J-Lo, the theatrical cut was hacked up to appeal to a younger audience..and yet, 5 years later, the director's cut is out on BluRay, and does not include the original theatrical version, a silent admission that Mark Steven Johnson's vision was the better of the two.'Daredevil' is an unusual superhero movie.  It is a truer film-noir than most. The essential aspect of film noir not being just a dark visual palette, but a main character becoming more tightly ensnared in a web of tragedy that he can't escape from.  Matt Murdock loses his sight, his father, his love, and as the violence escalates, finds little but faith to console him, and asks if it's enough. In the opening shot, he is bleeding, clinging to the concrete cross of the catholic church, and the film backtracks from his origin to his character's 'Dark night of the soul'.This reviewer found the vulnerability of the character, the fact that he's not 'super' much more interesting from an acting standpoint. Ben Affleck did get alot of bruises doing the stunts in the film and his performance has a true humility in certain scenes that hasn't been seen from him before or since.It's not perfect, though.  There are many scenes that are meant to lighten the mood that seem sophomoric, Colin Farrel as Bullseye comes off as a psychotic irish clown rather than the smug, gritty villain he was on the page, Elektra gets nearly no backstory here that would add depth to her(though Jennifer Garner is certainly no slouch on the athletics). The restored plotline of the murder of prostitute Lisa Tazio makes the final fight between Daredevil and Kingpin alot more meaningful, but it lacks oomph... the film is trying to sell you the idea that by looking out for the little guy, you can beat the big guys.. and the origin scene punches this theme.. as does the finale.. it just stumbles a little with it in between.Blame Marvel for the issues, though. You can glimpse brilliance all throughout this picture, if only they had let the director do his job without burying the whole thing in marketing.As for the transfer, this film has never looked or sounded better, the night scenes are perfectly lit, very sharp, and the sound design, particularly in the 'radar sense' sequences is stunning in 5.1.Like the comic book character himself, this film is flawed, yet has hidden excellence(I privately add one star).",3,Blu Ray Director's Cut,1225843200,"11 5, 2008",2008,2527,"['film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'chance', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Fans', 'comic', 'were', 'disdainful', 'casting', 'choices', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'was', 'paparazzi', 'mess', 'J-Lo', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'was', 'hacked', 'up', 'appeal', 'younger', 'audience..and', 'yet', '5', 'years', 'later', 'director', 'cut', 'out', 'BluRay', 'not', 'include', 'original', 'theatrical', 'version', 'silent', 'admission', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'vision', 'was', 'better', 'two', 'unusual', 'superhero', 'movie', 'truer', 'film-noir', 'most', 'essential', 'aspect', 'film', 'noir', 'not', 'being', 'just', 'dark', 'visual', 'palette', 'main', 'character', 'becoming', 'more', 'tightly', 'ensnared', 'web', 'tragedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'sight', 'father', 'love', 'violence', 'little', 'faith', 'console', 'enough', 'opening', 'shot', 'bleeding', 'clinging', 'concrete', 'cross', 'catholic', 'church', 'film', 'backtracks', 'origin', 'character', ""'Dark"", 'night', ""soul'.This"", 'reviewer', 'found', 'vulnerability', 'character', 'fact', 'not', ""'super"", 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'acting', 'standpoint', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'did', 'get', 'alot', 'bruises', 'doing', 'stunts', 'film', 'performance', 'true', 'humility', 'certain', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'since.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'though', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'meant', 'lighten', 'mood', 'seem', 'sophomoric', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'Bullseye', 'off', 'psychotic', 'irish', 'clown', 'rather', 'smug', 'gritty', 'villain', 'was', 'page', 'Elektra', 'nearly', 'backstory', 'here', 'would', 'add', 'depth', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'certainly', 'no', 'slouch', 'athletics', 'restored', 'plotline', 'murder', 'prostitute', 'Lisa', 'Tazio', 'final', 'fight', 'Daredevil', 'Kingpin', 'alot', 'more', 'meaningful', 'oomph', 'film', 'trying', 'sell', 'idea', 'looking', 'out', 'little', 'guy', 'can', 'beat', 'big', 'guys..', 'origin', 'scene', 'punches', 'theme..', 'finale..', 'just', 'little', 'between.Blame', 'Marvel', 'issues', 'though', 'can', 'glimpse', 'brilliance', 'picture', 'only', 'had', 'let', 'director', 'do', 'job', 'burying', 'whole', 'thing', 'marketing.As', 'transfer', 'film', 'never', 'looked', 'sounded', 'better', 'night', 'scenes', 'are', 'perfectly', 'lit', 'very', 'sharp', 'sound', 'design', 'particularly', ""'radar"", 'sense', 'sequences', 'stunning', '5.1.Like', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'film', 'flawed', 'yet', 'hidden', 'excellence', 'privately', 'add', 'one', 'star']",N/A

I loved the way the film was initially, but upon hearing that there were things removed from the film, it got me quite curious as to what the film would be like with the deleted material reincorporated back into the film.

608373,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLXE,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","**1/2 Matt Murdock is a mild-mannered, pro bono attorney by day and a high-flying, crime-fighting superhero by night.  The one thing that separates this costumed do-gooder (who goes by the name Daredevil) from his comic book brethren like Superman and Spiderman is that Murdock/Daredevil happens to be blind.  The same accident involving radioactive chemicals that, as a boy, deprived Matt of his eyesight also had the bizarre effect of heightening and enhancing his other senses, most notably hearing and touch, to an astonishing degree (it should be pointed out that little is done in the story with taste and smell).  The accident also appears, inexplicably, to have given him the power to defy the laws of physics and gravity.  Like any superhero worthy of the title, he uses these preternatural skills to right wrongs and bring justice to the imperiled and helpless citizenry living in the urban jungles of New York City.The hero's handicap seems to be about the only element, in fact, that distinguishes the movie ""Daredevil"" from the earlier films based on those other characters.  As conceived by writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, the tone of this film is a few shades darker than the one in ""Spiderman"" and a few shades lighter than the one in ""Batman"" and ""Darkman.""  Since there is nothing particularly fresh or groundbreaking offered in this film, one begins to wonder why Hollywood feels such a compelling need to drive this particular genre into the already over-saturated ground (even adolescents, the target audience for this type of film, seem to be tiring of all these offerings lately).  ""Daredevil"" provides all the requisite scenes of its superhero soaring through the air, jumping from building to building, and karate-chopping his way to victory over a plethora of bad-guy enemies.  But it's all starting to feel a bit old hat by this time, so much so that, even in the moments when ""Daredevil"" is good, the film doesn't feel innovative and fresh enough for us to really commit to it.  Ben Affleck, with his earnest and stolid seriousness, does manage to bring a certain gravity to the main character - and his relationship with Elektra (Jennifer Garner), a young woman with some ""superhero"" moves of her own, is genuinely charming and touching at times.  There is a lovely scene in which Matt envisions Elektra's beauty by hearing the raindrops falling on her face.  It is in rare moments such as this that ""Daredevil"" rises above the conventions of its genre, but such moments are very few and far between indeed.  Most of the running time seems to be spent on characters performing acrobatic kickboxing moves on tops of skyscrapers (all of which are decked out with statuary in places where nobody would ever be likely to see it).  Colin Farrell invests the implement-wielding villain, Bullseye, with an air of sly menace that makes him a worthy foil to the lovestruck boy wonder of the piece.  I must say, in way of a caveat, that some of the violence in the film is uglier and more mean-spirited in nature than is, perhaps, justified by the material.""Daredevil"" tries for a little thematic richness by dramatizing the internal conflict being waged inside Matt's psyche between the need to let the legal system runs its course and his own desire to achieve a little vigilante-type justice for the victims when the court system itself fails.  But that theme is never dealt with at any great level of depth.  The art direction, action sequences and special effects are generally impressive, but even they contribute to the generalized feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu that hangs over the work.  Maybe it's finally time to outgrow our obsession with superheroes who come out of nowhere to fight our battles for us - and time to stop always thinking of ourselves as some sort of defeated underdog in need of protection.  There are certainly enough life-sized heroes living and working in our own communities and neighborhoods to serve as our inspiration.Movies like ""Daredevil"" may, finally, have run their course.",2,so-so comic book film,1059177600,"07 26, 2003",2003,4040,"['**1/2', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'mild-mannered', 'pro', 'bono', 'attorney', 'day', 'high-flying', 'crime-fighting', 'superhero', 'night', 'one', 'thing', 'costumed', 'do-gooder', 'who', 'name', 'Daredevil', 'comic', 'book', 'brethren', 'Superman', 'Spiderman', 'Murdock/Daredevil', 'be', 'blind', 'same', 'accident', 'involving', 'radioactive', 'chemicals', 'boy', 'deprived', 'Matt', 'eyesight', 'also', 'had', 'bizarre', 'effect', 'heightening', 'enhancing', 'other', 'senses', 'most', 'notably', 'hearing', 'touch', 'astonishing', 'degree', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'little', 'done', 'story', 'taste', 'smell', 'accident', 'also', 'inexplicably', 'have', 'given', 'power', 'defy', 'laws', 'physics', 'gravity', 'superhero', 'worthy', 'title', 'preternatural', 'skills', 'right', 'wrongs', 'bring', 'justice', 'imperiled', 'helpless', 'citizenry', 'living', 'urban', 'jungles', 'New', 'York', 'City.The', 'hero', 'handicap', 'be', 'only', 'element', 'fact', 'movie', 'Daredevil', 'earlier', 'films', 'based', 'other', 'characters', 'conceived', 'writer/director', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'tone', 'film', 'few', 'shades', 'darker', 'one', 'Spiderman', 'few', 'shades', 'lighter', 'one', 'Batman', 'Darkman', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'fresh', 'groundbreaking', 'offered', 'film', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'feels', 'such', 'compelling', 'need', 'drive', 'particular', 'genre', 'already', 'over-saturated', 'ground', 'even', 'adolescents', 'target', 'audience', 'type', 'film', 'seem', 'be', 'tiring', 'offerings', 'lately', 'Daredevil', 'requisite', 'scenes', 'superhero', 'soaring', 'air', 'jumping', 'building', 'building', 'karate-chopping', 'way', 'victory', 'plethora', 'bad-guy', 'enemies', 'starting', 'feel', 'bit', 'old', 'hat', 'time', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'moments', 'when', 'Daredevil', 'good', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'innovative', 'fresh', 'enough', 'really', 'commit', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'earnest', 'stolid', 'seriousness', 'manage', 'bring', 'certain', 'gravity', 'main', 'character', 'relationship', 'Elektra', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'young', 'woman', 'superhero', 'moves', 'own', 'genuinely', 'charming', 'touching', 'times', 'lovely', 'scene', 'Matt', 'Elektra', 'beauty', 'hearing', 'raindrops', 'falling', 'face', 'rare', 'moments', 'such', 'Daredevil', 'conventions', 'genre', 'such', 'moments', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'far', 'indeed', 'Most', 'running', 'time', 'be', 'spent', 'characters', 'performing', 'acrobatic', 'kickboxing', 'moves', 'tops', 'skyscrapers', 'are', 'decked', 'out', 'statuary', 'places', 'where', 'nobody', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'likely', 'see', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'implement-wielding', 'villain', 'Bullseye', 'air', 'sly', 'menace', 'worthy', 'foil', 'lovestruck', 'boy', 'wonder', 'piece', 'must', 'say', 'way', 'caveat', 'violence', 'film', 'uglier', 'more', 'mean-spirited', 'nature', 'perhaps', 'justified', 'material', 'Daredevil', 'tries', 'little', 'thematic', 'richness', 'dramatizing', 'internal', 'conflict', 'being', 'waged', 'Matt', 'psyche', 'need', 'let', 'legal', 'system', 'course', 'own', 'desire', 'achieve', 'little', 'vigilante-type', 'justice', 'victims', 'when', 'court', 'system', 'theme', 'never', 'dealt', 'great', 'level', 'depth', 'art', 'direction', 'action', 'sequences', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'generally', 'impressive', 'even', 'contribute', 'generalized', 'feeling', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'work', 'Maybe', 'finally', 'time', 'outgrow', 'obsession', 'superheroes', 'who', 'come', 'nowhere', 'fight', 'battles', 'time', 'stop', 'always', 'thinking', 'ourselves', 'sort', 'defeated', 'underdog', 'need', 'protection', 'are', 'certainly', 'enough', 'life-sized', 'heroes', 'living', 'working', 'own', 'communities', 'neighborhoods', 'serve', 'inspiration.Movies', 'Daredevil', 'may', 'finally', 'have', 'run', 'course']",N/A

I mean ... LOVED the origin story in the beginning. It was PERFECT absolutely perfect. I can't say it enough, although a character or two was missing, they perfectly captured the spirit of what made Daredevil such an appealing character.The casting was pretty good.  I know I'm going against the grain on this one, but, in my opinion, I thought Ben Affleck was a terrific Matt Murdock/Daredevil. I felt that although Jennifer Garner looked amazing as Electra, her performance came across a little rigid, as if she couldn't relax into the role. Colin Ferrell was hysterical as Bullseye. Ferrell was clearly having the time of his life making the movie. Michael Clarke Duncan was OK as Kingpin, he certainly brought the correct physical presence to role role, if nothing else ...The stunts and 'shadow-vision' and effects, I enjoyed them all. I also LOVED all of the little nods to the comic book readers such as Frank Miller and Kevin Smith's cameo, seeing long-time artist John Romita's name as Jack Murdock's opponent.I loved the coy interaction between Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson or Matt Murdock and Electra. I ate it all up, I just couldn't get enough.But of all the things they could have possibly slipped on, how did they actually slip on the character of Daredevil? They turned him into Batman for God's sake! Daredevil isn't a dark brooding anti-hero and he certainly isn't a murderer. He's the guy you see leaping off of a twenty-story building without a net with a big grin on his face. He's Spiderman without the Spider.I was actually heartbroken that they had built up this insane amount of positive momentum and then lost it all when they turned Daredevil into a cold-blooded killer.

No, I didn't see X-Men, Batman, or Spiderman, but from the moment I read the synopsis of Daredevil, it was the only choice for me. I come from the school of tortured souls: Louis from Interview With the Vampire, Nick Knight from Forever Night, Father Kiernan from Stigmata. I want my hero to be both powerful and remorseful. Daredevil is both.Blinded as a child by a freak accident, Matt Murdock's other four senses are hypersensitive. As an adult, Matt is a pro bono lawyer in Hell's Kitchen, but despite his best efforts, his clients don't get justice. By night Matt dons a red leather costume complete with horns and doles out the deserved justice to rapists, murderers and thugs. But he is a tortured soul and seeks spiritual relief in a nearby church, the priest being one of the few that knows of his dual identity as Daredevil.Matt views his gifts as more of a curse: tormented by the extreme noise of the everyday, he sleeps in a sealed chamber. His cupboard is stocked with Vicodin and assortment of painkillers. His body is covered with scars, showing all too well that he is only human. And his life gets more complicated when he meets the beautiful (yet lethal) Elektra. Both Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner bring chemistry and believability to their roles, and there is definitely onscreen chemistry between the two. Matt's faith is tested as he is faced with losing everone and everything he's ever loved at the hands of Kingpin; it's a bitter fight to the finish.The storytelling is at times disjointed, the camera work seizure inducing (made me think of MTVesque Stigmata), the music an ear splitting blend of rock, alternative, and Rob Zombie. The visual and stunt work is incredible, with superhuman leaps, suspended kicks, and weapon trajectories (never knew that paper clips could be lethal weapons, did you?). There are moments of dark humour, most provided by pottymouthed Colin Farrell as Bullseye and Jon Favreau as Matt Murdock's sidekick. Sadly, the love story between Elektra and Matt didn't really play out much, and the film is short (103 min.). I found the ending unsatisfying, although it obviously sets up a sequel.

I thought the film was stupid, boring and Ben Affleck was very irritating. Actually I disliked the film so much that I walked out on it.A lot of things have happened since I saw the film in it's previous incarnation. I started collecting the book under the pen of Brian Michael Bendis. I can not say how impressed I have been. Here is a  superhero I can truly identify with.  I like Matt Murdock because he's a working class boy who made good. But whom at the same time has not abandoned his roots and defends the under dog whether as Daredevil or as a lawyer.It was my love and admiration of the comic book character which led me to rent and Daredevil the Directors cut. I have to say that this is a MUCH better version from the first. Where I found the first one annoying and un-watch able. I find the DC much more engaging and true to the character.  This film is not merely the original movie with added scenes. Scenes have actually been taken out from first movie (ie. the bedroom scene with Elektra) new scenes inserted and scenes shifted around to make more sense.  I find that the directors cut enhances who DD is, a hero who looks after the little guy. As opposed to the first film which sort of was nothing but a grown man playing masked hero.I really think that the creators short changed the movie going audience with the extremely poor film version.

I mean, if there was EVER an argument over the studios wanting to maximize the profits from one movie by releasing several versions of it, ""Daredevil"" makes a compelling piece of evidence for the trend.  (George Lucas himself would be the clincher for the plaintiff, but I digress).  As the talking heads say for themselves, there will always be praise and dirision for both versions.  I actually LIKED the cinema cut, despite some rather huge plot holes, but there is a case for telling what amounts to be the real story of ""Daredevil.""  The theater release was on the receiving end of some scathing reviews, and most of them were dead-on:  too little story, too many arty jump-cuts and ""cutsy"" bits (particularly in the playground ""fight-dance""), and too much buildup for too little payoff (the ""Kingpin Showdown"").So why was all the primo story sequences and extended fight stuff cut?  Demographics, my friend.  And I get the feeling most of the creative crew weren't involved with what went out, as the story only benfitted from them being left in.  THIS was a necessary rerelease.

608385,AIBRTGBN07D6A,B00005JLXE,Scott,"[6, 10]","Maybe not the worst ever, but definitely close. How they could have such a huge budget for this film and accept such a horrible story is beyond me.I've been a pretty big comic book fan for 20 years. While I never got into Daredevil too much, he made numerous guest appearances in my favorite comics, and I was looking forward to this film. Yes, it's a comic book movie, but the level of camp in this film was unreal. There must have been hundreds of cheesy lines in almost every line of dialog during this film, you'd almost think Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote the screenplay. Add to that the ridiculous amount of blind jokes and it was painful to sit through. Okay, Daredevil is blind, and yet has insanely high perception in his other senses, we get it. No need to show endless shots of him doing amazing things with his other senses to hammer this into our skulls. Bullseye has perfect aim and can hit anything he wants to, we get it, no need to show 20 scenes of him using this skill either.This film takes ""ridiculousness"" to a new level. Daredevil is human. Unlike Spider-Man, he has no genetic mutations. He simply has heightened senses from being blind. The story never proclaims he has anything other than human abilities either. However, there are literally hundreds of stunts that Daredevil does that are humanly impossible, I don't care how great he can here, there is no way he can jump 50 feet in the air, or vault off a 50 story building and land on a fire escape and not break his legs. This guy could give Spider-Man a run for his money for all the advantages they gave him.By letting Daredevil achieve insane stunts, it creates no sense of weakness for him. You are never left feeling like there is a battle this guy can't win, which is a mistake in film making. Daredevil can scale a 20 foot wall, yet he gets stabbed in the shoulder and that knocks him out for half the film? He can't summon the energy to help out Elektra, his love, yet right after that he can make his way a couple miles across town and get involved in the fight of his life?! This film is FILLED with inconsistencies, mistakes, and just absurd events that would require a complete suspension of belief reality in order to enjoy this film. I expect comic book movies to take some license, but this film makes ""Armageddon"" look like it was taken straight from the film vaults at NASA. And with all of this absurdity, there is no way to enjoy this film as a campy popcorn movie. I would consider ""Tomb-Raider"" a masterpiece in comparison.Perhaps the biggest flaw with this film is the CGI. For a recent movie, this is some of the worst CGI effects I have ever seen. None of it looked realistic. I can't think of a single special effect that I would believe. Remember that scene in Spider Man where Toby Maguire gets his new powers and starts jumping 50 feet in the air from roof to roof? Imagine an entire movie of that. They may as well have left the blue screens and wires in. At least Mark Steven Johnson admits on his commentary that the CGI is crap.Did I mention that Bullseye (with a horrible performance by Colin Farrell) actually cuts someone's throat with a playing card in this film and kills a man by throwing a paper-clip into his neck?!That being said, if you like this film, the DVD is loaded with bonus features. The audio and video come across very well, and the featurettes are fairly well done.

I will not say that he is the best super-hero that is out there today but I will say he is one of the most real.Daredevil has always been different than the other heroes in comic books because his disability is what GIVES him his power. He is proof that anything is possible and that anyone can overcome anything if they really have to.Daredevil is worth your time if you like super-heroes that are more human and full of flaws. Ben Affleck does a excellent job as Daredevil and he prooves that he has what it takes to portray a hero in the Marvel Universe. Mark Steven Johnson does an awesome job as the director and the writers are great at re-creating some of the best issues of Daredevil. Daredevil is slightly different from the comics but you feel like you are re-reading the best of Frank Miller's run on the comic once you view the film.Daredevil is not perfect (I can see why some of the comic fans would hate the adaptation) and it has some parts that are really lame but it is a good film if you really like the red hero that we all love. I would be bold enough to say that it is the best solo super-hero movie since &quot;Batman.&quot;The Daredevil film may not please all of the Daredevil comic fans but the DVD is set up in such a way that the Daredevil comic fans will find the extras well worth the price.

608388,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,B00005JLXE,Sirin,"[2, 4]","Another flick brought out to ride the current wave of comic book hero adaptations - parallels with the Spiderman series are too obvious to point out, but Daredevil has a darker edge to it. Young Matt Murdock (Scott Terra -the best actor in the film for my money) is blinded by radioactive waste and witnesses his father being murdered for refusing to throw a fight. So he grows up (elder Matt played by Ben Affleck) to become a blind pro bono lawyer by day and violent avenger of justice by night, following up gruesome revenge killings by visits to the confessional box. He meets Electra (Jennifer Garner), a beautiful martial arts expert and they fall in love. They combine to fight the forces of evil - Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan, excellent and under used) and Bullseye (Collin Farrell - ludicrously over acted).Potentially a good comic book adaptation, but disappointing for the following reasons. Affleck in the lead doesn't act out the role with nearly as much charisma as the comic book hero Daredevil requires. And the film treats his blindness in a slightly too surreal manner- Matt can see people by hearing raindrops fall on them- to be realistic. At other points, he seems to be able to manouever just as well as a sighted person with only the occasional concession to his blindness, as if the director is conscious of the need to highlight Daredevil's handicap but unsure exactly how to go about it.The dialogue is often cliched 'They say when you die your whole life flashes before you' type thing and, at other times, curiously baseless. Such as the priest telling Daredevil during one of his confessions that 'Those who live without fear live without hope'. What does this mean exactly?The fight scenes are often unispiring and at times yawn inducing and the score is too intrusive - often introducing characters to bad rock soundtracks.Is the film enjoyable? At times, yes, there are good scenes. But these are outweighed by the weak ones.

608390,A2GOQJY0RPAF9D,B00005JLXE,S. N. LLOYD-COOMBS,"[1, 2]","First off, let me state, that most of you won't agree with this review. Especially, if you're fans of this movie. But I simply want to make my opinion heard. This DVD has already been released in Australia so I can give a fair review about it.The story revolves around Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck...Ugh!) who loses his sight at a very young age when chemical waste is sprayed onto his face due to a work accident. From there, his father (inspired by his son) goes back to his boxing past time. Where he then declines to take a dive and is ultimately killed by the mysterious Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan).Matt Murdock realises that even though he is blind, his other senses escalate to a point where he can practically see again. Matt Murdock, then fights for 'Justice' over the death of his father. Matt Murdock is DareDevil, a street smart vigilante crime-fighter who falls in love with the beautiful martial-arts master Elektra (Jennifer Garner).The DVD itself is spectacular with DTS 5.1 and over 5 hours of special features. We are also given an excellent video transfer where the world of DareDevil really comes to life. The menus are also exquisite, with DareDevil's soundwave vision setting the scene. The DVD also includes Director's commentary with an 'Enhanced Viewing Mode' which is 8 multi-angle behind-the-scenes segments.The documentaries give a great inside look to this 80 million dollar blockbuster. The second disc comes close to 3 hours of featurettes which is great for the up and coming film makers. All in all a great DVD.Now, onto the movie. The movie is very Clich&eacute;. And when I say Clich&eacute;...I mean CLICHE. For instance, Matt Murdock is a lawyer and when a rapist gets away he walks out of the courtroom and his best friend asks if he wants to go out that night? Matt Murdock replies 'I'm busy' and then we pan in on his face showing him get into his DareDevil get up and go after the rapist. Another moment is when DareDevil is up on the rafters of a bar and a man asks him what he wants. DareDevil replies 'Justice' to which he goes and attacks all the criminals.It seems as though the director didn't try and steer the Marvel superhero franchise into any new direction (unlike Ang Lee) but instead just tried to capitalise on the success of Comic book heroes of late. With a movie named 'DareDevil', you'd think that they would try and do something daring to the actual franchise to at least differentiate itself from Spiderman. But it does nothing of a sort.The screenplay is dismal, it has an unoriginal plot and really is just a filler for 99 minutes. Mark Steven Johnson tries to pull out some biblical allusions spliced with how the Law is juxtaposed to it. Johnson also tries to recreate the gothic setting that Burton used so well in Batman, though it just seems as though the production crew ran out of ideas.One of my biggest qualms with this movie is that there is absolutely NO character development. It just jumps from one scene to the other and assumes the viewer knows what is going on both story wise and character wise. And CGI seems to be overused in this film, I mean honestly, to CGI a rat walking through a gutter is just taking it too far.In summary, the DVD is good with a score of 8/10. The movie though is just bad. Plain out, a film that relied on its budget and franchise name to get viewers. It gets a 4/10.Get the DVD for the features....not the film!",3,Daredevil....Daring enough for DVD???,1058400000,"07 17, 2003",2003,3420,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'state', 'most', 'wo', ""n't"", 'agree', 'review', 'Especially', ""'re"", 'fans', 'movie', 'simply', 'want', 'make', 'opinion', 'heard', 'DVD', 'already', 'been', 'released', 'Australia', 'can', 'give', 'fair', 'review', 'it.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Ugh', 'who', 'sight', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'when', 'chemical', 'waste', 'sprayed', 'face', 'due', 'work', 'accident', 'there', 'father', 'inspired', 'son', 'back', 'boxing', 'past', 'time', 'Where', 'then', 'take', 'dive', 'ultimately', 'killed', 'mysterious', 'Kingpin', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', '.Matt', 'Murdock', 'even', 'blind', 'other', 'senses', 'escalate', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'practically', 'see', 'again', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'then', 'fights', ""'Justice"", 'death', 'father', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'DareDevil', 'street', 'smart', 'vigilante', 'crime-fighter', 'who', 'love', 'beautiful', 'martial-arts', 'master', 'Elektra', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', '.The', 'DVD', 'spectacular', 'DTS', '5.1', 'over', '5', 'hours', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'excellent', 'video', 'transfer', 'where', 'world', 'DareDevil', 'really', 'life', 'menus', 'are', 'also', 'exquisite', 'DareDevil', 'soundwave', 'vision', 'setting', 'scene', 'DVD', 'also', 'Director', 'commentary', ""'Enhanced"", 'Viewing', 'Mode', '8', 'multi-angle', 'behind-the-scenes', 'segments.The', 'documentaries', 'give', 'great', 'inside', 'look', '80', 'million', 'dollar', 'blockbuster', 'second', 'disc', 'close', '3', 'hours', 'featurettes', 'great', 'up', 'coming', 'film', 'makers', 'great', 'DVD.Now', 'movie', 'movie', 'very', 'Clich', 'eacute', 'when', 'say', 'Clich', 'eacute', 'mean', 'CLICHE', 'instance', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'lawyer', 'when', 'rapist', 'away', 'courtroom', 'best', 'friend', 'go', 'out', 'night', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'replies', ""'m"", 'busy', 'then', 'pan', 'face', 'showing', 'get', 'DareDevil', 'get', 'up', 'go', 'rapist', 'moment', 'when', 'DareDevil', 'up', 'rafters', 'bar', 'man', 'what', 'DareDevil', ""'Justice"", 'criminals.It', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'steer', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'franchise', 'new', 'direction', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'instead', 'just', 'tried', 'capitalise', 'success', 'Comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'late', 'movie', 'named', ""'DareDevil"", ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'try', 'do', 'something', 'daring', 'actual', 'franchise', 'least', 'differentiate', 'Spiderman', 'nothing', 'sort.The', 'screenplay', 'dismal', 'unoriginal', 'plot', 'really', 'just', 'filler', '99', 'minutes', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'pull', 'out', 'biblical', 'allusions', 'spliced', 'how', 'Law', 'juxtaposed', 'Johnson', 'also', 'recreate', 'gothic', 'setting', 'Burton', 'used', 'so', 'well', 'Batman', 'just', 'production', 'crew', 'ran', 'ideas.One', 'biggest', 'qualms', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'character', 'development', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'other', 'viewer', 'what', 'going', 'story', 'wise', 'character', 'wise', 'CGI', 'be', 'overused', 'film', 'mean', 'honestly', 'CGI', 'rat', 'walking', 'gutter', 'just', 'taking', 'too', 'far.In', 'summary', 'DVD', 'good', 'score', '8/10', 'movie', 'just', 'bad', 'Plain', 'out', 'film', 'relied', 'budget', 'franchise', 'name', 'get', 'viewers', '4/10.Get', 'DVD', 'features', 'film']",N/A

608393,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00005JLXE,Steven Reynolds,"[1, 1]","""Daredevil"" can stand its ground in the teen-action market with ludicrously choreographed fight sequences, an ear-flaying soundtrack, and a visual style boasting more flair and realism than ""Spider-Man"". But when it comes to plot, characterization and the inevitable love interest, it's an entirely different story. Or, rather, it isn't one. And that's a problem. Hamstrung by repetitve romantic and 'character' scenes, the plot never gets off the ground. While this may have been a deliberate choice - a movie-length Act 1 to an endless series of sequels - it just isn't interesting. Rather than coming up with a character-establishing adventure which is thrilling in its own right (as Brian Singer did so well in ""X-Men""), writer/director Mark Steven Johnson opts for a more schematic, episodic approach, yoking it all together with tenuous motivations and a ponderous explanatory voiceover. Perhaps aiming for a broader demographic than under-25 males, romance is over-emphasised at the expense of the edgier, darker undercurrents which could have been more interestingly explored. But maybe that wouldn't have helped. For me, there's always something a little silly about these comic book superheroes violently working through their childhood traumas. It works on the page, but on the screen it feels false: perhaps increased fidelity to visual reality demands the same at the emotional level. Ironically, without the antidote of much deliberate humour (used to great effect in ""Spider-Man"") we end up laughing anyway. As he so often is in other roles, Ben Affleck is spectacularly unconvincing as Murdock/Daredevil. Jennifer Garner makes an appealing heroine as Elektra, so it's a shame she won't be back. Colin Farrell as Bullseye finally gets to release the inner Irish wildman the tabloids keep telling us about, and is the only one who seems to be having fun. Michael Clarke Duncan booms his way through another scary-big-guy performance as the utterly superfluous villain (can anyone even remember what he wanted?). And John Favreau?

608394,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,B00005JLXE,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[0, 0]","The early 2003 film season sees its first high-profile release in ""Daredevil,"" the cinematic adaptation of Marvel Comics classic comic book character. The recent successes of Brian Singer's ""X-Men"" (2000) film and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002) film have made the super hero genre vogue once more as ""Daredevil"" is but the first of a wave of comic book films scheduled for release in the next two years. Yet, with the memory of Joel Schumacher's ""Batman"" films still fresh in the minds of filmgoers, there is an understandable trepidation directed toward any new men-in-tights film. Long-time Marvel Comics fans in particular may be suffering from an additional series of anxiety attacks if they remember the low budget ""Captain America"" (1991) and ""Punisher"" (1989) films from years past and the banished Roger Corman-produced Fantastic Four film (1994) which can currently be found only through non-mainstream channels. Some questionable casting choices announced last year also raised some concerns. Jennifer Garner as Elektra? Could her performance be strong enough to overcome the distraction created by the fact that she looks nothing like the Elektra inhabiting the comic book page? Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock/Daredevil? Could he project the necessary heroic presence that comic book readers since 1964 have become accustomed to seeing in the Man Without Fear?For those of you unfamiliar with the Daredevil character, attorney Matt Murdock is the crimson-clothed vigilante. When he was a young boy, he was blinded by radioactive material. Although he lost his sight, his other remaining senses were enhanced multifold. Of particular note was a special ""radar sense"" that he possessed which enabled him to ""see"" his surroundings. He used this radar sense along with a specially designed billy-club, and his own top-conditioned body to fight crime and catch the criminals he could not put away through his civilian legal endeavors.Admittedly, the preview trailers for the film appeared encouraging with each new trailer being better than the previous one. Early buzz from preview audiences was positive and the endorsement of the film by filmmaker-comic book writer Kevin Smith certainly didn't hurt. Yet, a final verdict could not be rendered until the film itself was released and seen in its entirety. After seeing the film on opening day, I can safely say that any fears over its quality have proved unfounded. ""Daredevil"" is great.Director and screenplay writer Mark Steven Johnson wisely mined the strongest source material for the character in its 38-year publication history - the Frank Miller Daredevil/Elektra/Kingpin/Bullseye issues of the early 1980's. Writer-artist Miller introduced a new grittiness to the character in a grand story-arc that firmly established Daredevil's crusade to take back the streets from the Kingpin. In the comic book storyline, Daredevil starts to make progress in disrupting the Kingpin's operations on the street level but his former lover, Elektra, falls from grace and sides with the Kingpin. This enrages Bullseye who has now been replaced as the Kingpin's top assassin. Bullseye escapes from prison and kills Elektra to regain his former position and then sets his sights on Daredevil to avenge the humiliation he suffered when Daredevil saved his life in an earlier confrontation. When the dust settles, the Kingpin is defeated after Daredevil forces him to choose between his wife and his criminal empire, Elektra is dead, and Bullseye is paralyzed. Many comic book fans still regard these issues as the high point of the Daredevil run and anyone interested in sampling these issues for the first time should check out the recent ""Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller"" reprint collections.Expectedly, the ""Daredevil"" film does not adapt everything from the comic book storyline to the screen. This is a necessary evil of the adaptation process where compromises and abridging are the norm. What did make it to screen, however, is a faithful-in-sprit translation of the source material. There are a number of changes which I will not detail but the epic scope of the Miller works have been kept intact as best as possible. Affleck does an admirable job at portraying Matt Murdock, capturing all of the angst, conflict, and guilt that the character experiences because of the conflicts of his civilian and super-hero identities. Garner is the surprise of the film as she immediately makes you forget about any objections over her casting. While she does not possess the classical Greek profile, she ably transforms into the deadly sai-wielding fighter that comic books fans are familiar with. Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farrell similarly do not resemble their print counterparts, but also distinguish themselves through their fine portrayals. Also Jon Favreau and Joe Pantoliano are great in bringing two of the most important characters in the Daredevil mythos to life - Foggy Nelson and Ben Urich. There are other references throughout the film to past and present Daredevil creators (including an extended cameo by Kevin Smith) that should put a smile on many faces. And of course, the customary Stan Lee appearance in a Marvel Comics film is also there. One final note - be sure to remain seated while the end credits are rolling - there's a coda to the film that shows up that you don't want to miss.",4,"""A man without fear is a man without

608396,AM71STVDHO48S,B00005JLXE,Stoddard76,"[4, 6]","I am a huge fan of Daredevil Comics and was so disappointed when I saw the theatrical release of Daredevil the movie. I understand that the producers were trying to market it for a broader audience but I disagree with their ""fast pace/all action"" product. The movie was LAME! It wasn't even entertaining for its badness, like ""Batman Forever"" or ""Batman and Robin"" were. The movie was so abysmal that I felt like stabbing myself in the eyes. The producers forgot that appealing to a broader audience should not mean loosing the story and strong character development.However, despite this fact, when I saw that there was a re-release of the film in a director's cut I thought I would give it a try. To my great shock, the movie is 110% better! A much stronger story (if you could even say the original release had a story), and a lot more nods to the Frank Miller comics that made me a Daredevil fan in the first place. I like Daredevil the film now. I do hope that someday Chris Nolan and the folks responsible for ""Batman Begins"" will look to do a Daredevil movie the way it ought to be, until then this director's cut is pretty decent. Yes, you must still get over the bad casting (and acting might I add) of Ben Affleck, Colin Farrell, Coolio (why does Coolio need to be in this film--who the hell thought that was a good idea? Fire him immediately!) and Michael Clarke Duncan (and why was he cast as the Kingpin??? And why doesn't Ben Urich work for the Daily Bugle in the film for that matter?) but despite these issues the movie is far better in this director's cut than the theatrical release.Caesar says thumbs up!",3,Much better than the theatrical release!,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,1623,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Daredevil', 'Comics', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'when', 'saw', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Daredevil', 'movie', 'understand', 'producers', 'were', 'trying', 'market', 'broader', 'audience', 'disagree', 'fast', 'pace/all', 'action', 'product', 'movie', 'was', 'LAME', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'entertaining', 'badness', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'were', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'abysmal', 'felt', 'stabbing', 'eyes', 'producers', 'forgot', 'appealing', 'broader', 'audience', 'should', 'not', 'mean', 'loosing', 'story', 'strong', 'character', 'development.However', 'fact', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 're-release', 'film', 'director', 'cut', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try', 'great', 'shock', 'movie', '110', '%', 'better', 'much', 'stronger', 'story', 'could', 'even', 'say', 'original', 'release', 'had', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'nods', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'comics', 'made', 'Daredevil', 'fan', 'first', 'place', 'like', 'Daredevil', 'film', 'now', 'do', 'hope', 'someday', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'folks', 'responsible', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'will', 'look', 'do', 'Daredevil', 'movie', 'way', 'ought', 'be', 'then', 'director', 'cut', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Yes', 'must', 'still', 'get', 'bad', 'casting', 'acting', 'might', 'add', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Coolio', 'why', 'Coolio', 'need', 'be', 'film', 'who', 'hell', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'Fire', 'immediately', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'why', 'was', 'cast', 'Kingpin', 'why', ""n't"", 'Ben', 'Urich', 'work', 'Daily', 'Bugle', 'film', 'matter', 'issues', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'director', 'cut', 'theatrical', 'release.Caesar', 'thumbs', 'up']",N/A

608399,A2FIMQIKNOHFPK,B00005JLXE,S. White,"[1, 1]","Finally!Having grown up reading the comic from the Frank Miller era it would be fair to say I was a fan long before the film arrived. Having seen the studio release when it first came out I enjoyed the film but certainly felt it was missing something. That something that was missing has been judiciously amended in the Directors Cut of which this review comprises.The Directors Cut proves yet again that studio's don't know as much as they think they know about the movie going audience. The decision to cut important character development, sub plot and themes which serve to enhance and underpin the Daredevil story merely reveals this flawed 'think tank in a bubble' aspect of the industry. What is put back into the film is a crucial 30 minutes of footage that was initially deemed superfluous to the action - not by the director it must be said but rather the studio heads.The difference between Daredevil the Studio release to the Directors Cut is glaring and in the case of the latter what we are presented with is a Marvel superhero film of great depth and action combined. This is the way intelligent audiences always want their Marvel films - the studio's seem to miss this at times and assume we all just want action without storyline or character development ... how wrong they are!A great deal of what initially fell to the cutting room floor was the story of Matt Murdock's ( Daredevil by day ) legal business partner Foggy played by Jon Favreau. It would have been criminal for this footage to never see the light of day as Jon Favreau brings a much needed light and contrast to the darker aspects of the films mood which also serves as exposition for what passes for Matt Murdock's normal day to day life as a lawyer. Through Matt's exchanges with Foggy we are also able to witness a more three dimensional and human side to Daredevil. Without Foggy we'd have a 2D superhero that not even the comics presented but which the studio's saw fit to provide us with in their chosen release! Are you listening film makers?The treatment of Daredevil overall is pretty well spot on as we get to see his origins as a young boy growing up in New Yorks Hell's Kitchen, the son of a working class single parent who is a boxer down on his luck.There are plenty of clever nods to the Comic reading audience with the various names of fighters being the names of artists in Marvel who worked on Daredevil over the years. We get a nice cameos from Stan 'the man'Lee and one other absolute classic appearance from a Daredevil artist later in the film in a scene with Ben Urich, played by the great Joe Pantolano.Ben Afleck does a great job playing Matt Murdock as does the stunning Jennifer Garner who plays what must be the ultimate film version of Elektra. Both of them put a great deal of work into training martial arts with the likes of Jeff Imada ( Bourne Identity ) and Wu Ping ( Crouching Tiger et al ) but I did feel the fight scene with Murdock and Elektra in the school playground was the weakest of the fight scenes in the entire film ... frankly it looked very stiff and not particularly fluid as it should have been. In the 2 disc version of the Directors Cut that I have we see the Chinese wire crew performing the fight scenes as they worked them out in Hong Kong using only handycams. What we see in these rough cuts is the difference between Martial Artists/Athletes and actors! Having said all this the rest of the fight scenes in the film were excellent and very well choreographed and performed.Michael Clark Duncan is superbly well chosen to be the giant mob boss King Pin and the director was absolutely correct in ignoring skin colour and instead making sure that the spirit of King Pin was served through the right man playing the role ... he does indeed bring the gargantuan quality to King Pin to the big screen.Colin Farrell as Bullseye is actually very good indeed and as he says himself, he 'camps it up' as that is exactly what we would expect from a complete psychopath like Bullseye. Having Farrell play himself as Irish was the best move yet and he brings something very nasty to the role even though his character is so over the top. When we finally get to the crucial Frank Miller scene with Elektra and Bullseye it really is quite gut wrenching and Farrell delivers a kiss of death that saw the film elevated to an R rating based on this act alone! Not that I felt an R rating for this scene was justified but I agree that for younger audiences it is quite a powerful scene and can see why they may have given it an R.Jenifer Garner as I said earlier is absolutely stunning as Elektra and is certainly not just a pretty face. She brings a visceral quality to Elektra that certainly brings her to life in way Daredevil fans could have only hoped for - her weapons work in the film is very well done and is to be commended.All in all Daredevil the Directors Cut builds beautifully as it was supposed to have done and runs in at 128 mins which for me was not overly long at all. I will say it again, an audience would happily sit through an extra 30 minutes of footage that brings essential character development to a film and adds depth to the storyline. Rather than sit through a dissatisfying action film which runs in 30 minutes shorter and makes little sense of the overall theme it should serve as testimony to the fact that this kind of thinking from studios is a false economy.We can have our popcorn and eat it too ... the Directors Cut gives you exactly that!",5,Directors Cut - The sweetest cut of all!,1219622400,"08 25,

Somehow watching the two documentaries  breathes new life into both the film and the character DareDevil. I gained a new appreciation for this project which I found to be an OK film in theatres but overall a dudd compared to X-Men or Spiderman. I appreciated that it was far more darker and reminded me of the way Spawn was made. A darker hero with more guts and they weren't afraid to show that this story was not gonna end like Peter and Mary Jane. Despite it's many flaws (The use of rock music, it's short 90 minute span, the playground fight scene) it seemed to get better as the movie went on. In the end I enjoyed it enough to buy it. This DVD surprised me because this movie was alot less embarassing on TV then in a theatre. Some really bad lines are now just funny and entertaining where in theatres we all seemed to share the cringe of a badly read line by Mr. Ben ""Can't Act"" Affleck. Such as when he tells a villian ""The light at the end of the tunnel, thats not heaven. It's the C train""The casting of Collin Ferrel must have put everyone to shame when he stole the show as the maniacle villian Bullseye. The rest of the performances are enough to fill the cliche of each character but never do they ever break the mold or bring anything new to the table. I loved the shot if ol' horn head on the cross at the beginning (stolen from Spawn btw) and their were many great ""hero"" shots. It was deep enough to not be stale or  boring and in the end I think Hollywood could have made a far worse film. I have a soft spot for seeing Comic book characters come to life, even in a flawed film it's still a thrill.

While not as coma inducing as Spiderman (a film that I felt was way overhyped and unjustly overpraised) Daredevil falls woefully behind other Marvel films. While Ben Affleck is adequate as the masked superhero, he seems very uncomfortable in the role. I can't exactly say why, but it just appears that he is not ""having fun"" kicking [booty] and taking names. Colin Farrell is absolutely hilarious as Bullseye, actually stealing most of the scenes he is in. Jennifer Garner it appears was placed in the film for one reason and one reason only, eye-candy. Michael Clarke Duncan spends most of the movie handing out roses and ordering people to do all the dirty work. In fact, so inconsequential is the supporting cast in this movie that the screenwriters apparently felt that a literate script was not even needed. Visually, Daredevil is top notch. The fight scenes are kinetically charged with flying fists and jittery camera work, and the prog/rock soundtrack fits the mood very well.

A year before, millions of people worldwide embraced the film ""Spiderman."" While Spidy's film was, in itself, quite good, it had a different atmosphere altogether. The mood fit the comic's style and story. Unfortunately, with a hero like Daredevil, the general 'comic fan' is unaware of the mood of the DD comics - dark, gritty, and ultimately quite realistic. I loved comics as a kid, and one of the books I had a subscription to was Daredevil. I liked the fact that although he was a good guy, he played by his own rules. DD would rather kill the bad guy than bring him into the cops like Spiderman would. This fact turned off a large number of viewers who were looking for another Spiderman-esque kid-friendly film. The sadthing is that the viewer is treated to the most faithful comic book adaptation since Tim Burton's magnificent ""Batman"" film. The only thing about this film that I didn't like was the choice of its villian. True Bullseye was a good choice, and Colin Farrell did the character justice, I would have rather seen the film focus on the Kingpin...or even Typhoid Mary, my personal fav DD bad guy. Regardless, the film is an amazing introduction to those unfamiliar with the DD universe(believe me there are quite a few!), and hopefully will spawn a GOOD franchise.

By day, Matt Murdock represents the downtrodden from his shoestring law firm, while at night - haunted by the death of his father - he stalks the streets, relentless in his pursuit of justice where the guilty often find, there is hell to pay!ReviewOpening with a credit sequence that sees a CGI recreation of a Manhattan skyline at night swept through with ease by a free flying camera that discovers various nightlights that merge to form Braille print that subsequently morphs into the various names of Daredevil's stars, one is instantly given the theme of the movie.  Ben Affleck's portrayal of Daredevil sees him create a distinct variation on the shadow play and angst that generally drives the superhero desire to vanquish all evil.  This is a man who has learnt not to fear, bullied as a child he has overcome his physical weaknesses and learnt to use his inflicted blindness to his advantage.  Yet the death of his father haunts him and his search to discover the Kingpin's (Duncun) identity propels him to fight crime whatever the cost may be.While similarities can be seen between Tim Burton's original Batman, as we witness our crime fighter destroy both thugs and powerful villains alike, from the darkness of an alley to the airiness of a corporate environment such as a courtroom, there is something distinct in this reworking of the little know Stan Lee classic.  Indeed, I must admit to being surprised at the enjoyment I felt in watching Affleck and indeed the powerful Elektra (Garner) defeat a steady flow of bad guys.  Like Xmen, there isn't a rush to thrown an audience into a comic they know nothing about as the story is built apace, with both intelligence and a believability that one generally is not accustomed to in such a film.Like John C. Reily and Steve Buscemi manage to steal their films with very little screentime so does another character actor, Joe Pantoliano, succeed as the hidden star of Daredevil.  Playing New York Post investigator Ben Urich, Pantoliano brings a credibility to this superhero fable that very few actors could have.  But his chance at the title for stealing the show is knocked clean out of the room by Colin Farrell's Bullseye: an Irish villain that never misses.  It may be surprising that a character with a target tattooed on his head does so well to both entertain and create a believable threat to the hero of the piece but then again anyone that flicks a peanut into an elderly lady's mouth to shut her up on his long haul flight has got to be evil enough to possibly defeat Daredevil, even if he is flying economy class!The VerdictWhile it did have one continuity error of note involving a clock on a subway platform, Daredevil is a competent action movie that relies more on old-school storytelling rather than OTT CGI.  Besides any film the cameos Kevin Smith has got to be worth your time.  The bottom line is that Daredevil doesn't patronise and is satisfyingly entertaining without pandering to the merchandise friendly 12A kids market it instead opts to tell a dark tale that will excite and thrill, just try to forget that Affleck is dressed in red leather.",3,It may not be X-Men but it's not Flash Gordon either!,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3542,"['BriefBased', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'character', 'created', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Bill', 'Everett', '1964', 'Daredevil', 'man', 'blinded', 'child', 'freak', 'chemical', 'accident', 'whom', 'may', 'say', 'can', 'see', 'better', 'sight', 'world', 'eternal', 'darkness', 'filled', 'scents', 'tastes', 'textures', 'sounds', 'keen', 'awareness', 'not', 'be', 'hampered', 'fear', 'sight', 'may', 'induce', 'day', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'downtrodden', 'shoestring', 'law', 'firm', 'night', 'haunted', 'death', 'father', 'streets', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'justice', 'where', 'guilty', 'often', 'find', 'hell', 'pay', 'ReviewOpening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'CGI', 'recreation', 'Manhattan', 'skyline', 'night', 'swept', 'ease', 'free', 'flying', 'camera', 'various', 'nightlights', 'merge', 'form', 'Braille', 'print', 'subsequently', 'various', 'names', 'Daredevil', 'stars', 'one', 'instantly', 'given', 'theme', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'portrayal', 'Daredevil', 'create', 'distinct', 'variation', 'shadow', 'play', 'angst', 'generally', 'superhero', 'desire', 'vanquish', 'evil', 'man', 'who', 'learnt', 'not', 'fear', 'bullied', 'child', 'overcome', 'physical', 'weaknesses', 'learnt', 'use', 'inflicted', 'blindness', 'advantage', 'death', 'father', 'search', 'discover', 'Kingpin', 'Duncun', 'identity', 'fight', 'crime', 'cost', 'may', 'be.While', 'similarities', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'original', 'Batman', 'witness', 'crime', 'fighter', 'destroy', 'thugs', 'powerful', 'villains', 'alike', 'darkness', 'alley', 'airiness', 'corporate', 'environment', 'such', 'courtroom', 'something', 'distinct', 'reworking', 'little', 'know', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'classic', 'Indeed', 'must', 'admit', 'being', 'surprised', 'enjoyment', 'felt', 'watching', 'Affleck', 'indeed', 'powerful', 'Elektra', 'Garner', 'defeat', 'steady', 'flow', 'bad', 'guys', 'Xmen', ""n't"", 'rush', 'thrown', 'audience', 'comic', 'know', 'nothing', 'story', 'built', 'apace', 'intelligence', 'believability', 'one', 'generally', 'not', 'accustomed', 'film.Like', 'John', 'C.', 'Reily', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'manage', 'steal', 'films', 'very', 'little', 'screentime', 'so', 'character', 'actor', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'succeed', 'hidden', 'star', 'Daredevil', 'Playing', 'New', 'York', 'Post', 'investigator', 'Ben', 'Urich', 'Pantoliano', 'credibility', 'superhero', 'fable', 'very', 'few', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'chance', 'title', 'stealing', 'show', 'knocked', 'clean', 'room', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Bullseye', 'Irish', 'villain', 'never', 'may', 'be', 'surprising', 'character', 'target', 'tattooed', 'head', 'so', 'well', 'entertain', 'create', 'believable', 'threat', 'hero', 'piece', 'then', 'again', 'anyone', 'peanut', 'elderly', 'lady', 'mouth', 'shut', 'up', 'long', 'haul', 'flight', 'got', 'be', 'evil', 'enough', 'possibly', 'defeat', 'Daredevil', 'even', 'flying', 'economy', 'class', 'VerdictWhile', 'did', 'have', 'one', 'continuity', 'error', 'note', 'involving', 'clock', 'subway', 'platform', 'Daredevil', 'competent', 'action', 'movie', 'more', 'old-school', 'storytelling', 'rather', 'OTT', 'CGI', 'film', 'cameos', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'got', 'be', 'time', 'bottom', 'line', 'Daredevil', ""n't"", 'patronise', 'satisfyingly', 'entertaining', 'pandering', 'merchandise', 'friendly', '12A', 'kids', 'market', 'instead', 'tell', 'dark', 'tale', 'will', 'excite', 'thrill', 'just', 'try', 'forget', 'Affleck', 'dressed', 'red', 'leather']",N/A

Affleck is better than I thought he'd be, Garner is beautiful, Duncan is great as Kingpin and Colin is fun. Some say David Keith's character was totally wrong, but that's how his character is in other versions of the story. Check out the Spiderman Vs Daredevil DVD. How DD goes blind is the same in that version as in the movie so they drew from existing DD lore.The fight between Elektra and Bullseye was right out of the comic! Unlike some, I don't think waiting ten years before Bullseye and Elektra's big scene would have been too practical and don't mind that they gave it to us up front. I can't wait for the Elektra movie! I also thought that scenes like the return of DD's strength in the church was the type of superhero stuff that has a place in a superhero movie, and liked the way DD heard Ben's car with his super hearing and used it. It didn't contradict DD's scene with the Kingpin at all.The movie paints with a broad brush Murdock having fun with his powers more than he should if he want's to keep his secret identity, but DD's secret identity has been revealed in the comic and he always shared his identity with too many people anyway. The playground scene was so much like the one with DD and Echo in the comics and I thought it was so over the top it was fun. Stan Lee often made things over the top.Ben Urich, Bullseye, and the Kingpin may not look identical to the characters in the comics, but that's often the case when comic books are turned into movies. I wish the DD costume had been a tiny bit closer to the comic book type, but it wasn't bad. According to the DVD DD almost ended up wearing a sweat shirt with a hood and some of the other costumes tried are awful! The director makes it clear he wanted the comic styled costume and even put in a reason for DD to button the top button of his movie costume towards the end of the film so he could look even closer to the way he does in the comic and I thought that was clever.There's room for improvement, but Daredevil is a good superhero movie.

I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck and when I heard he had been cast as the vengeful Matthew Murdock, I thought &#34;Well, the movie is doomed.&#34; Fortunately, this is one time where Affleck rises to his potential and adds to a film's value instead of decreasing it.Matt Murdock (Affleck) is a powerful lawyer who has given up all opportunities to make a fortune in corporate law and instead has returned to his boyhood neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen in New York City to mostly work on pro bono cases. As a child Murdock was left blind in a bizarre chemical accident. However, the accident that took his sight has heightened all his other senses to a supernatural level. At the end of his work day as a lawyer, Murdock goes home and changes into a costume and become Daredevil, the man with no fear. Daredevil is really starting to clean up the crime in Hell's Kitchen and New York's biggest crime boss, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) doesn't like it one bit. So, he sends an Irish assassin, Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to get rid of Daredevil. Along the way, a female vigilante named Elektra shows up on the scene and gets in the way of everything. She falls in love with Matt, but doesn't like Daredevil that much because she believes he's preventing her from killing the man who was responsible for her father's death, Kingpin. And so as the world turns, these are the days of comic book heroes' lives.DAREDEVIL is a very entertaining movie. It's full of action, lots of pretty stars who do a decent job at acting, witty humor, cool special effects, awesome sets, and sweet costumes. However, there is one component that keeps the movie from rising above an average comic book movie: a plot without any holes. Overall the movie moves along alright, but every once in awhile there is a scene and the audience goes &#34;where did that come from.&#34; Somebody either screwed up in editing or the writing left too much to the imagination. Either way, you can't leave too much to the imagination in a comic book movie; a little, yes, but not a lot and there's way too much missing in DAREDEVIL. Still, if you can overlook the occasional plot holes, DAREDEVIL is a thrill to watch.",3,Parts of the Plot Disappear,1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,2244,"['really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'DAREDEVIL', 'that', 'much', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'when', 'heard', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'vengeful', 'Matthew', 'Murdock', 'thought', '34', 'Well', 'movie', 'doomed.', '34', 'Fortunately', 'one', 'time', 'where', 'Affleck', 'potential', 'film', 'value', 'instead', 'decreasing', 'it.Matt', 'Murdock', 'Affleck', 'powerful', 'lawyer', 'who', 'given', 'up', 'opportunities', 'make', 'fortune', 'corporate', 'law', 'instead', 'returned', 'boyhood', 'neighborhood', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'mostly', 'work', 'pro', 'bono', 'cases', 'child', 'Murdock', 'was', 'left', 'blind', 'bizarre', 'chemical', 'accident', 'However', 'accident', 'took', 'sight', 'heightened', 'other', 'senses', 'supernatural', 'level', 'end', 'work', 'day', 'lawyer', 'Murdock', 'home', 'changes', 'costume', 'become', 'Daredevil', 'man', 'fear', 'Daredevil', 'really', 'starting', 'clean', 'up', 'crime', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'New', 'York', 'biggest', 'crime', 'boss', 'Kingpin', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'bit', 'So', 'Irish', 'assassin', 'Bullseye', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'get', 'rid', 'Daredevil', 'way', 'female', 'vigilante', 'named', 'Elektra', 'up', 'scene', 'way', 'everything', 'love', 'Matt', ""n't"", 'like', 'Daredevil', 'much', 'preventing', 'killing', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'father', 'death', 'Kingpin', 'so', 'world', 'are', 'days', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'lives.DAREDEVIL', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'full', 'action', 'lots', 'pretty', 'stars', 'who', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'acting', 'witty', 'humor', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'awesome', 'sets', 'sweet', 'costumes', 'However', 'one', 'component', 'movie', 'rising', 'average', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'plot', 'holes', 'movie', 'along', 'alright', 'once', 'awhile', 'scene', 'audience', '34', 'where', 'did', 'come', 'from.', '34', 'Somebody', 'screwed', 'up', 'editing', 'writing', 'left', 'too', 'much', 'imagination', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'too', 'much', 'imagination', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'little', 'yes', 'not', 'lot', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'missing', 'DAREDEVIL', 'Still', 'can', 'overlook', 'occasional', 'plot', 'holes', 'DAREDEVIL', 'thrill', 'watch']",N/A

I know Mark Steven Johnson wishes he released this film into theatres instead of the ""cut & stitched"" abridged version that didn't impress most.  After seing this film, I treat it as the original faithful artwork, while the theatrical release is just an imposter.So many great elements were lost from this film.  All the extra material definately raises the movies credibility and worth.  And all for what? We cut it out to save bathroom breaks?  And we added a sex scene to appeal to lovers and perverts?  In my opinion, some of the artistic bits were cut from the film, in attempt to ""Hollywoodize"" the flick.The Director's cut is the fan's movie.  I may be biased being a fan of comic book movies, but I think anyone could agree that the pieces taken out were not only to satisfy fanatics, but they were important building blocks to these characters and stories.Every character has more meaning: Dardevil has a stronger relationship with her father, Elektra shows more of her Greek culture, Kingpin displays more cruelty, Bullseye becomes a better villain.  And did anyone say ""Hey I saw Coolio in the trailer! Where the heck did he go?""  Well he's in this film and he's actually not a bad actor at all.  And finally, for those that wished there was more humourous dialogue between Foggy and Matt, your dinner is served.  I think the old/new jokes are funnier than the originals.Bottom Line: See Daredevil in an entirely new movie.

608424,A7GSGC0G8R6PW,B00005JLXE,Tyler Tanner,"[0, 0]","Growing up reading Daredevil, I gave this movie a lot of slack. There are some great moments and when they work they really work. Those of you familiar with the Elektra/Bullseye storyline will not be disappointed. The directors use of radar is very well used and went beyond my expectations. He even manages to convey Matt's acute sense of smell. And the fight are the best so far in a comic hero adaptation. Check out the duel with the motorcycle. Some great tension between Affleck and Farrell.However the script is appallingly bad. Director/screenwriter Johnson is not satisfied establishing certain elements once and treats the audience as if they were 12 by continually beating you over the head with character revelations, plot points, repeated dialouge and gimmicks (yes, we understand that the scar on Bullseye's head is in fact a Bullseye and that he has the same name.) The fight on the playground is coreographed nicely, but is awkwardly placed and campy. Johnson should stick to the direction and instead of Kevin Smith making a cameo, have him write the next one. Wait a minute! Didd'nt the star Ben Affleck win an Oscar for writing? This is a great matinee movie and I am looking forward to the sequel. If at all to see what they improve upon.

608425,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B00005JLXE,V. Berk,"[13, 16]","Superhero movies have become one of the highest-grossing genres in the moviemaking business and for good reason.  They provide fantastic escapism and bring the fantasies from the pages of comics to life.  One such film was the 2003 adaptation of Marvel Comic's character Daredevil.Now, I'm sure I'll take some heat for this from fans of the comic, but I've never really enjoyed the Daredevil comics all that much; a red-horned wearing Stan Lee/Marvel rebuttal to DC's Batman.  This kept me from being interested in the comics, but I always enjoy a good superhero movie so I gave the film adaptation of Daredevil a shot.  Like many, I found the product disappointing...but then I discovered there was a Director's cut many claimed to be drastically different from the theatrical release I had witnessed...That is correct.  The Director's Cut is indeed a whole other film that stands on its own as an engaging superhero flick.  I'll just have to summarize both versions without giving away too much- just so you can understand the differences.Theatrical Cut: 2.5/5 StarsThis is the version of the film most people have probably seen and found to be severely disapointing.  It clearly tries to follow up Spider-Man with wall-to-wall special effect fights with gravity defying, Matrix-influenced fights.  The only real highlight is Colin Farrell as assassin Bullseye, whose over-the-top antics and remorseless killing make for quite a show.  Matt Murdock's (Daredevil) daytime career as a lawyer who stands for the little-man is totally glossed over in order to increase the action percentage and the Kingpin (played outstandingly by Michael Clarke Duncan) is so underdeveloped and unintimidating that he seems more like a glorified CEO than a prominent crime lord.In its theatrical format Daredevil is a fairly typical superhero movie.  Wall to wall fantasy action with minor character development, but little soul; only good thing to be found here is the soundtrack which features some contemporary songs and a stylish directing style.Director's cut: 4/5 StarsMost of the flaws of the theatrical cut are resolved in this grittier version of the film.  This isn't one of those director's cuts like Alien Vs. Predator where they splatter some CGI blood but the final result still blows chunks.  No, this Director's Cut truly is an alternate cut that bears only a vague resemblance to the theatrical cut.Allow me to list some reasons why this cut is vastly superior to the edition many of you saw in theaters back in '03.1. Character development:  Matt Murdock is developed as a character and a lawyer instead of being simply the man in the red costume.  He is a conflicted individual who doesn't quite know yet what he wants to be; only that he wants to take down crime in whatever manner possible. The Kingpin is shown as a brutal crime boss who rules without remorse.  Electra is cut-back in this version, but this version of the film she really is only a supporting cast member (which I prefer because her character was the weakest part of the theatrical cut, in my personal opinion).  Only character without improvement is the over-the-top Bullseye, but this is for the best seeing as Farrell's character really does work best as a whimsical enigma (Farrell does however get to drop the film's single F-bomb).2. New Scenes:  An entire subplot cut from the theatrical cut involves Matt Murdock represented a drug dealer (Coolio) who has been framed by the Kingpin for the murder of a prostitute.  This entire subplot works in developing a reason for Daredevil to want the Kingpin while in the theatrical cut it turns the hunt for Kingpin a simple revenge story of Daredevil getting angry over his murdered romantic lead.  Because of this the film takes on a new emotional depth.3. Alternate Scenes:  Scenes such as the love scene between Affleck and him in confession have been removed from this cut of Daredevil .  Those tacked on, crowd-pleasing moments that seemed to drag down the pacing of the film have been removed from the director's vision of the film creating better flow along with giving the hero a more tragic story.4. Fight Scenes:  Now, if you hated the Matrix/Spider-Man fight scenes from the theatrical cut I'm sorry to say those are still here.  I liked most of these fights (except the unnecessary one between Matt and Electra in the park which is just worthless filler) but the one that improves the most in this version is the climatic fight between Daredevil and Kingpin.  In the theatrical cut Kingpin is a pushover (in the theatrical cut you might as well turn the film off after Bullseye is taken out).  In the Director's Cut Michael Clarke Duncan takes the opportunity to remind us he was a professional bodyguard prior to breaking into the acting scene.  This is a brutal fight between a David and Goliath that doesn't let you down considering the way the film has built it up.5. Tone:  This film is no Spider-Man.  Action scenes might be similar, but the tone of this Director's Cut makes a fine attempt at following the footsteps as such greats as The Crow.6. Humor:  Even though this cut is far darker than the theatrical cut it also manages to insert a fair dose of brisk humor.  This allows leveling out the tension and making for a more exciting experience.  Action scenes are fun, but without interludes they just become boring, which was a primary problem with the theatrical cut.Now, the Director's Cut is not without faults (hence why I only give it Four Stars).  It still suffers in the believability of its action scenes and the weak performances from Jennifer Garner, but overall it wins my approval.  Does that mean you'll like it?  Well, to put it in perspective I didn't necessarily ""hate"" the theatrical cut.  I just found it generic and dull.  Now, if you absolutely HATED the theatrical cut for its unbelievable action scenes, and the presence of Ben Affleck simply for being...Ben Affleck, odds are you will still detest this film.If you thought the theatrical cut was only a missed opportunity?  I suggest you pick up a copy of the director's cut and prepare to see this film in a whole new light!  It isn't perfect, but it is a magnificent improvement!",4,An alternate cut that actually is an ALTERNATE (not to mention better) cut!,1276560000,"06 15, 2010",2010,6200,"['Superhero', 'movies',

The Daredevil character on film is only slightly related to the powerful comic book hero. This is unfortunate because the non-comic book fans would think the two characters are the same. I admit it is difficult to create the complexity of comic book heroes in only two hours. For the film maker, what needs to be done in two hours is make a profit. If the profits are good then a sequel will follow. To do this there is nothing like exploiting a successful Marvel comic book action hero like Daredevil.If the movie Daredevil is compared independently of the comic book Daredevil character then I would have to admit that the movie was worth it. Jennifer Garner made this movie worthwhile with a look, which can only be described as ""dangerously sexy."" I am not surprised that her character, Electra, is being given her own starring role in an upcoming movie.The movie is visually dark but still stunning at times. In some cases the scenes were a bit too dark and some might even say depressing. The darkness is in keeping with the comic book feel but certainly not the depression.This movie is worth a look and even a DVD purchase but it is not the classic that I hoped it would have been.",4,Not a Classic but....,1051574400,"04 29, 2003",2003,1310,"['agree', 'loyal', 'Daredevil', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'who', 'say', 'movie', 'only', 'commercial', 'tribute', 'blind', 'Superhero', 'Daredevil', 'character', 'film', 'only', 'slightly', 'related', 'powerful', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'unfortunate', 'non-comic', 'book', 'fans', 'would', 'think', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'same', 'admit', 'difficult', 'create', 'complexity', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'maker', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'two', 'hours', 'make', 'profit', 'profits', 'are', 'good', 'then', 'sequel', 'will', 'follow', 'do', 'nothing', 'exploiting', 'successful', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'hero', 'Daredevil.If', 'movie', 'Daredevil', 'compared', 'independently', 'comic', 'book', 'Daredevil', 'character', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'admit', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'made', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'look', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'dangerously', 'sexy', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'character', 'Electra', 'being', 'given', 'own', 'starring', 'role', 'upcoming', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'visually', 'dark', 'still', 'stunning', 'times', 'cases', 'scenes', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'dark', 'might', 'even', 'say', 'depressing', 'darkness', 'keeping', 'comic', 'book', 'feel', 'certainly', 'not', 'depression.This', 'movie', 'look', 'even', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'not', 'classic', 'hoped', 'would', 'have', 'been']",N/A
608428,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JLXE,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[219, 226]","A marked improvement over the previous version of the film, ""Daredevil"" (Director's Cut) allows director and co-writer Mark Steven Johnson to adjust his film to the darker aspects he originally wanted to portray on screen. I won't be reviewing the previous edition in this review at all (since amazon.com inadvertently combines all editions into one pool this may end up under the previous theatrical DVD release), but will focus on what makes the ""Director's Cut"" unique and worth picking up for fans of the movie and the comic book.Sometimes ""Director's Cuts"" are a mere attempt by the studio to make more money or the director to create something successful out of a disaster. That isn't the case with ""Daredevil""(Director's Cut). Director Johnson originally intended to focus as much on Daredevil as he did on Matt Murdock and his career as a crusading lawyer fighting for the underdogs. The 30 minutes of additional footage adds an important subplot about the murder of a hooker which is pinned on street thug (Coolio). The fight sequence at the end between Kingpin and Daredevil is longer and more involved. Many of the fight sequences are cut with an ""R"" rating movie in mind (and that's what this DVD version received as its rating). Some of the love story between Elektra and Daredevil gets shortened here as well in favor of developing Murdock's character and for some truly interesting (and occasionally funny) courtroom scenes.Johnson was required by his contract to provide a PG-13 movie and, as a result, he had to reshuffle the movie a bit cutting out much of the subplot as well as trimming down the more intense fight sequences of the film. There's also a number scenes related to character development that got lost along the way most notably the reporter that follows the Daredevil and Murdock himself. Restoring these sequences improve the film and add strength to a narrative that had a number of holes in it and was too simply resolved. Additionally, it gives more substance to Matt Murdock's character creating a much more complex person. We also see much more about Kingpin and scenes that demonstrate how dangerous he can be.The transfer here actually looks a bit sharper and with slightly better clarity the the original DVD. Like the previous edition, this one has been transferred in the anamorphic widescreen format which translates to better image quality than a standard widescreen transfer. The sound is also top notch with nice use of the surround sound format.This ""Director's Cut"" doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the previous edition (in fact it is a single disc release). The only extras are Johnson and producer Avi Arad's commentary track for this edition (which was in preparation for DVD before the movie was even released to theaters) and a 15 minute featurette on the director's intension in creating this edition. While it lacks the extras on the previous edition, it more than makes up for them with a stronger film. My only complaint is that this should have been released at the same time as the original DVD and/or in place of it with a second disc of extras. Unfortunately, Fox has participated in the old double dip.Overall, ""Daredevil"" is much improved with this special edition. It's a pity it came out so long after the original (much like the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies). Johnson points out in the featurette that he considers ""Daredevil"" to still be flawed movie and while he may be right, restoring the first R rated version certainly makes this film stronger. The ""Director's Cut"" is far closer to Frank Miller's comic book vision of ""Daredevil"" than the previous edition. Fans of the movie will definitely want to pick this up.",4,"Improved version of ""Daredevil""",1101513600,"11 27, 2004",2004,3695,"['marked', 'improvement', 'previous', 'version', 'film', 'Daredevil', 'Director', 'Cut', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'adjust', 'film', 'darker', 'originally', 'wanted', 'portray', 'screen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'reviewing', 'previous', 'edition', 'review', 'amazon.com', 'inadvertently', 'editions', 'one', 'pool', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'previous', 'theatrical', 'DVD', 'release', 'will', 'focus', 'Director', 'Cut', 'unique', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'fans', 'movie', 'comic', 'book.Sometimes', 'Director', 'Cuts', 'are', 'mere', 'attempt', 'studio', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'director', 'create', 'something', 'successful', 'disaster', ""n't"", 'case', 'Daredevil', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Director', 'Johnson', 'originally', 'intended', 'focus', 'as', 'much', 'Daredevil', 'did', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'career', 'crusading', 'lawyer', 'fighting', 'underdogs', '30', 'minutes', 'additional', 'footage', 'important', 'subplot', 'murder', 'hooker', 'pinned', 'street', 'thug', 'Coolio', 'fight', 'sequence', 'end', 'Kingpin', 'Daredevil', 'longer', 'more', 'involved', 'Many', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'cut', 'R', 'rating', 'movie', 'mind', 'what', 'DVD', 'version', 'received', 'rating', 'love', 'story', 'Elektra', 'Daredevil', 'shortened', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'favor', 'developing', 'Murdock', 'character', 'truly', 'interesting', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'courtroom', 'scenes.Johnson', 'was', 'required', 'contract', 'provide', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'result', 'had', 'reshuffle', 'movie', 'bit', 'cutting', 'out', 'much', 'subplot', 'as', 'well', 'trimming', 'down', 'more', 'intense', 'fight', 'sequences', 'film', 'also', 'number', 'scenes', 'related', 'character', 'development', 'got', 'lost', 'way', 'most', 'notably', 'reporter', 'Daredevil', 'Murdock', 'Restoring', 'sequences', 'improve', 'film', 'add', 'strength', 'narrative', 'had', 'number', 'holes', 'was', 'too', 'simply', 'resolved', 'Additionally', 'more', 'substance', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'character', 'creating', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'person', 'also', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'Kingpin', 'scenes', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'dangerous', 'can', 'be.The', 'transfer', 'here', 'actually', 'bit', 'sharper', 'slightly', 'better', 'clarity', 'original', 'DVD', 'previous', 'edition', 'one', 'been', 'transferred', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'format', 'better', 'image', 'quality', 'standard', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'sound', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'nice', 'use', 'surround', 'sound', 'format.This', 'Director', 'Cut', ""n't"", 'have', 'bells', 'whistles', 'previous', 'edition', 'fact', 'single', 'disc', 'release', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'Johnson', 'producer', 'Avi', 'Arad', 'commentary', 'track', 'edition', 'was', 'preparation', 'DVD', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'released', 'theaters', '15', 'minute', 'featurette', 'director', 'intension', 'creating', 'edition', 'extras', 'previous', 'edition', 'more', 'up', 'stronger', 'film', 'only', 'complaint', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'original', 'DVD', 'and/or', 'place', 'second', 'disc', 'extras', 'Unfortunately', 'Fox', 'participated', 'old', 'double', 'dip.Overall', 'Daredevil', 'much', 'improved', 'special', 'edition', 'pity', 'came', 'out', 'so', 'long', 'original', 'much', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movies', 'Johnson', 'out', 'featurette', 'Daredevil', 'still', 'be', 'flawed', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'restoring', 'first', 'R', 'rated', 'version', 'certainly', 'film', 'stronger', 'Director', 'Cut', 'far', 'closer', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'comic', 'book', 'vision', 'Daredevil', 'previous', 'edition', 'Fans', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'pick', 'up']",N/A

608430,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00005JLXE,wellwellwell,"[1, 1]","For those of you who know Ben Affleck as a lesbian-chaser/comedy-only guy, you just may be slightly shocked with his performance in ""Daredevil"".  In this comic-based film, Affleck assumes the role of Matt Murdock as well as the ""justice to be served""-minded Daredevil.  But, as in many other comics, his character of Daredevil is hidden from the real world.  And his everyday disposition is portrayed through Matt Murdock, a lawyer.  But what is interesting about Matt is the fact that when he was a kid he was blinded; yet what blinded him only made him stronger in his other four senses.  Then soon after he lost his sight, someone killed his father.  But as he searches for revenge, he becomes more and more insecure about his role.You must understand that this movie is based on a comic book.  And a comic book is meant mainly for kids to be able to understand.  So if you're thinking to yourself, partway into the movie, that the plot is kind of bogus--you're right.  It's meant to be that way.  As I don't want to spoil any of the movie for you, I won't tell you much of what happens.  But as you can imagine, Daredevil runs accross many foes and a few friends.  One of those friends is played by Alias' (on HBO) Jennifer Garner.  She (as the beautifully strong Elektra) becomes, after a impressive fight with Ben, friends with Matt.  But the life story of Elektra is not quite favorable, to say the least.What really makes this movie excellent is not the plot.  It's the direction.  Mark Steven Johnson did an awesome job with, as I said before, a guy who didn't have much of an action background to support him.  But from what I saw on a VH1 All Access show, Affleck and a few others took around two months of training for their roles.  And it shows.  You don't have to be a genius to see that.  And if you're thinking to yourself that the scenes look too fake, you just don't understand.  Another big plus for the movie was the supporting cast.  It features, aside from Garner, Michael Clarke Duncan of ""The Green Mile"", Jon Favreau (who gives us some much needed comedy--without him that would've been something the film lacked), and Joe Pantoliano (""Memento"" and ""The Matrix"").  There is also a cameo appearance by comic enthusiast and Ben's lifetime friend/co-worker, Kevin Smith.  And if you're a Kevin Smith fan you'll love his appearance as a forensic assistant.  I think Kevin was the only person to use a swear word in the movie.  And fitting it was.  Being that his movies are mostly curse words and vulgarity (not to say that's bad).Although I did not see ""Spider-man"", I'm going to assume that ""Daredevil"" is somewhat similar to it.  I think that's a fair assumption.  The reason I gave this movie 4 stars, and not five, has to do with Kevin Smith.  Being the big Smith fan I am, I was disappointed to hear that his next project ""Jersey Girl"" was to be delayed.  It was delayed because Affleck wanted to play the parts in ""Daredevil"" and ""Jersey Girl""; yet this one came first.  Call me shallow or call me stupid, but I don't think that's a way to treat a friend, or a girlfriend (Jennifer Lopez will be co-starring with him in ""Jersey Girl"", out this summer).  Anyway, you should see ""Daredevil"".  If you enjoy Ben Affleck, action or comics, then this movie is definitely for you.  It's a great action-packed movie with a great cast; and it's one of the best comic book stories I've ever been a part of.

At the time, there wasn't much action out and i like most of Ben Affleck's movies, so though i would give it a go. Although i liked the theatrical release ( but didn't love it) i still bought it when it came to DVD...and to be honest, when i watched it the 2nd time on DVD, i didn't think as much of it, as when i left the cinema.So when i heard the directors cut was out, and people who hated the first release, but liked the 2nd one, i thought wow, i didn't mind the first, perhaps i will really like the new version. and guess what? I did ! Its absolutely fantastic. After the characters were fleshed out more, the storyline was more involved and filled in the plots- you actually cared about what happened and got more into the feel of being apart of what was going on in hell's kitchen.If you watch the ""featurette"" : giving the devil his dues, you will understand that Mark Johnson the director, absolutely loves this material, loved the comic, and was disappointed himself with the theatrical release. He understood why the critics & fans alike didn't support it, and really wanted to fix the problems with this DVD.

And can hold our attention for more than 100 minutes. Here's a simple plan for your money making schemes - and this goes to Gary Foster ( producer who still says the theatrical version of daredevil is better) If you make a GOOD MOVIE, that gets good reviews, and that fans & critics enjoy, then more people will see it, more people will see it a 2nd time, more people will recommend it to friends, and that means a bigger audience, a repeat audience and bigger dollars for your pockets ! So while the first was a quick paced movie that made quick bucks, a longer - more thought-out MOVIE, would have garnered longer life at the box office.",4,director's cut- do yourself a favor.

But it is particularly average, nothing really special. In fact to me it was a bit of a dissapointment, I'd really wanted more from it.Fast forward to now and anyone in the same position as me really really should watch the directors cut. Why this wasnt made the theatrical release I don't know! It improves on the original in every possible way.The film is generally a lot darker, showing the real price Matt Murdock pays for being Daredevil. Theres an amazing scene expaned upon where he comes back from dealing with a rapist and he reveals his back to show many many scars and you get a great sense of his unhappiness. Also added is a new sub plot that deals with a man falsly accused of murder and Matt's defence of him as he follows the trail all the way back to the king pin. All of this helps build the finale up to more than just vengence for a lost girlfriend but for all of hells kitchen.On top of that the completely redundant sex scene is removed which doesnt detract from his relationship with Electra, far from it, instead it builds it up into something purer and more special than it was before and more tragic when he loses her. The end fight with the kingpin is expanded uopn in a way that feels natural rather than forced, as if thats exactly how it should have been first time round.On top of this there have been lots of small touches included into the new edit, the emphasis on the catholic influences upon Murdocks life as well as a reference to his mother that fans of the comic will love. The parts of Ben Urich and Matt's law partner have been new and expanded scenes that all benefit the film.I really cant stress enough how much of an improvement this is, even if you loved the first cut you should watch this, I'm sure you'll be amazed! The darkness and humanity of the character have been brought to life superbly, and the end result is all the better for the changes.",5,Watch Daredevil How It Should Be Seen,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,1975,"['first', 'saw', 'Daredevil', 'cinema', 'be', 'fair', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'particularly', 'average', 'nothing', 'really', 'special', 'fact', 'was', 'bit', 'dissapointment', ""'d"", 'really', 'wanted', 'more', 'it.Fast', 'forward', 'now', 'anyone', 'same', 'position', 'really', 'really', 'should', 'watch', 'directors', 'cut', 'Why', 'wasnt', 'made', 'theatrical', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'original', 'possible', 'way.The', 'film', 'generally', 'lot', 'darker', 'showing', 'real', 'price', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'being', 'Daredevil', 'amazing', 'scene', 'expaned', 'where', 'back', 'dealing', 'rapist', 'back', 'show', 'many', 'many', 'scars', 'get', 'great', 'sense', 'unhappiness', 'Also', 'added', 'new', 'sub', 'plot', 'deals', 'man', 'falsly', 'accused', 'murder', 'Matt', 'defence', 'trail', 'way', 'back', 'king', 'pin', 'build', 'finale', 'up', 'more', 'just', 'vengence', 'lost', 'girlfriend', 'hells', 'kitchen.On', 'top', 'completely', 'redundant', 'sex', 'scene', 'removed', 'doesnt', 'detract', 'relationship', 'Electra', 'far', 'instead', 'up', 'something', 'purer', 'more', 'special', 'was', 'more', 'tragic', 'when', 'end', 'fight', 'kingpin', 'expanded', 'uopn', 'way', 'natural', 'rather', 'forced', 'thats', 'exactly', 'how', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'time', 'round.On', 'top', 'have', 'been', 'lots', 'small', 'touches', 'included', 'new', 'edit', 'emphasis', 'catholic', 'influences', 'Murdocks', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'reference', 'mother', 'fans', 'comic', 'will', 'love', 'parts', 'Ben', 'Urich', 'Matt', 'law', 'partner', 'have', 'been', 'new', 'expanded', 'scenes', 'benefit', 'film.I', 'really', 'cant', 'stress', 'how', 'much', 'improvement', 'even', 'loved', 'first', 'cut', 'should', 'watch', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed', 'darkness', 'humanity', 'character', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'life', 'superbly', 'end', 'result', 'better', 'changes']",N/A

Well, this movie makes the cut.  Although I haven't been a big fan of either the Daredevil comic, Ben Affleck or Jennifer Garner, this movie didn't disappoint me.  It had all the elements of a comic book come to life on the big screen, including a star-crossed romance (think ""Blade"" and ""Spider-Man"").  And just as ""Spider-Man"" gave us a new perspective on Tobey Maguire, I now understand the sex symbol appeal of hunky Ben Affleck.  Go get 'em, tiger!  It's obvious Ben lost some weight and gained some muscle mass in all the right places, because he's doing that daredevil costume much justice in the movie.  Jennifer Garner's role as Elecktra needed a little polish, I thought, but her effort filled the requirement.  And frankly, I'd watch Michael Clarke Duncan do a Rice Krispies commercial.

Jennifer Garnner plays a very good Elektra. She portrays the comic book charactor very well.

Anyway, I'm glad to report that, unlike what most critics say, it's not a cartoony version but a dark story driven movie ala the Crow. The way Daredevil's radar sense is protrayed is quite genius and Colin Farrell is superb as Bullseye (Even though, I don't care much for Colin.). He uses a mixture of insanity and pride to bring him to life. And the use of John Favrou and Foggy Nelson brings just the right amount of humor to it. The Director's Cut improves over the theatrical version in so many ways that I recommend it to those who have never seen this movie. Now, I'm sure someone will ask ""Is the Director's Cut that good?"", and the answer is that it's like a completely different movie. The theatrical cut is 103 minutes. The director's cut is 133 minutes. That half hour of extra footage makes a huge difference. Just rent it -- trust me, it's good. The relationship with Elektra isn't as big and there's much more focus on Daredevil, the Kingpin, and the world they exist in. The Director's Cut was 20 times better than the theatrical version. It added a whole subplot that really wove together the entire story. Plus, there is a cool scene in the first of the movie with the bar fight scene where Daredevil walks across these burning pool tables and crouches down to look at the bad guy.
