If you are looking for a light, romantic comedy that is cleverly written and wonderfully acted and don't mind reading French subtitles (unless of course you speak French) you will probably really enjoy this film as I did.  I knew nothing about it, so I didn't go in with any preconceived notions and with a romantic comedy I never really expect anything but a happy ending and a fun story to follow, so I loved the film.The premise is two painfully shy and therapy going singles meet when Angelique applies for a position at a Chocolate Company, thinking it is for the position of Chocolatier.  To her surprise she is hired then dismayed when she realizes that the position is one of a salesperson, too shy to explain that she doesn't want the position she amps herself up giving herself little pep talks and heads out to try to sell chocolate, meanwhile her boss, Jean Rene takes the advice of his therapist and asks Angelique out and their date is quite hilarious as they navigate the situations that arise.  Angelique has a secret about her prior career and plans to try to help the nearly bankrupt chocolate company try to change their line of goods to save the company, all while she and Jean Rene realize that they are falling in love.Predictable?

1504124,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B005V4X8PO,David Bower,"[1, 2]","This is a romantic comedy in French about two emotionally handicapped people who find life filled with challenges that would go unnoticed by most of us. One can only wonder what sort of influences in their lives would make people so emotionally handicapped as to prevent them from engaging in what would be thought of as normal situations and relationships.To their credit they are both in therapy, either group as in the case of Ang&eacute;lique Delange, a talented chocolate maker, or individual, as in the case of Jean-Ren&eacute; Van Den Hugde, the owner of a nearly bankrupt chocolate factory, and seeking to reduce or eliminate their symptoms.As fate would have it, they are thrown together at a critical juncture in their lives and discover possibilities that they could not have imagined. This story of finding each other and trying to find themselves results in a tender, sometimes frustrating, love story that will leave you smiling.While some sections are rather contrived, the overall effect is touching and permits the viewer to develop feelings of concern for both parties. While it was hard for me to relate to the problems they had I could sympathize, at least to some degree, with their efforts to rise above their personal challenges and forge a relationship that would be of great benefit to both of them.I suggest you watch this one before buying as it may or may not be one you would want to see more than once.",4,Pleasant but Mildly Irritating,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,1432,"['romantic', 'comedy', 'French', 'two', 'emotionally', 'handicapped', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'life', 'filled', 'challenges', 'would', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'most', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'sort', 'influences', 'lives', 'would', 'make', 'people', 'so', 'emotionally', 'handicapped', 'prevent', 'engaging', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'thought', 'normal', 'situations', 'relationships.To', 'credit', 'are', 'therapy', 'either', 'group', 'case', 'Ang', 'eacute', 'lique', 'Delange', 'talented', 'chocolate', 'maker', 'individual', 'case', 'Jean-Ren', 'eacute', 'Van', 'Den', 'Hugde', 'owner', 'nearly', 'bankrupt', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'seeking', 'reduce', 'eliminate', 'symptoms.As', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'critical', 'juncture', 'lives', 'discover', 'possibilities', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'imagined', 'story', 'finding', 'other', 'trying', 'find', 'results', 'tender', 'sometimes', 'frustrating', 'love', 'story', 'will', 'leave', 'smiling.While', 'sections', 'are', 'rather', 'contrived', 'overall', 'effect', 'touching', 'viewer', 'develop', 'feelings', 'concern', 'parties', 'was', 'hard', 'relate', 'problems', 'had', 'could', 'sympathize', 'least', 'degree', 'efforts', 'rise', 'personal', 'challenges', 'forge', 'relationship', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'benefit', 'them.I', 'suggest', 'watch', 'one', 'before', 'buying', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'once']",Romantics Anonymous

This French comedy centers around two oddball loners, each carrying around their own baggage of emotional hang-ups and relational insecurity, and their inevitable love connection.  Angelique meets Jean-Rene when she accepts a job at his failing chocolate factory.  She is desperate for work but tremendously ill-at-ease around others just as Jean-Rene himself is making a last ditch hiring effort to save his business but can barely handle the simple social demands of interviewing applicants, answering the phone, speaking to strangers, etc.  The story is not particularly inventive and you know the end from the beginning, but oh the journey is such fun!  What makes Romantics Anonymous succeed so joyously is the superb acting by the leads.  Both manage to create tremendously sympathetic characters with subtle performances that rely on small mannerisms, quietly awkward pauses and hiccups, and nearly restrained facial expressions that capture perfectly two individuals barely hanging on while trying to appear as normal as possible.  The dialogue is also excellent and witty, using just the right words to communicate the simultaneous discomfort and longing our protagonists share. There are numerous laugh-out-loud moments and the whole experience is heartwarming and sweet.  This is a movie that will likely fly under nearly everyone's radar, but what a shame.

1504128,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B005V4X8PO,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","With intertextual nods to LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG and CHOCOLAT (amongst others), ROMANTICS ANONYMOUS can hardly be said to be particularly original in terms of plot.  The nuances of chocolate and their relationship to human behavior have been well analyzed in all types of film, even CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.  Nonetheless Jean-Pierre Am&eacute;ris' film is a charming comedy set in a provincial French town, in which Ang&eacute;lique Delange (Isabelle Carr&eacute;), a genius at chocolate making who passes herself off as a sales executive, and her boss, the gloriously named Jean-Ren&eacute; van den Hudge (Benoit Poelvoorde), repeatedly convince themselves that they are not in love with one another, while behaving in precisely the opposite way.  The problem is that both of them have a chronic lack of self-confidence.  The film offers them several opportunities to get together, but eventually stages the d&eacute;nouement during the meeting of a self-help group called Romantics Anonymous (hence the title).  Several of these sequences are cleverly filmed - for example the night when both of them are thrown together in the same hotel room during a chocolate-tasting convention.  Jean-Ren&eacute; tries every trick in the book to leave the room; having plucked up the courage to tell Ang&eacute;lique his feelings, he finds that she has run away.  The main actors offer winsome central performances, and the props also help define their natures.

Written (with Philippe Blasband) and directed by Jean-Pierre Am&eacute;ris this little film takes advantage of the  fine comedic talents of the two stars and brings a supporting cast of of actors to the table who demonstrate how fine cameo roles can be polished.Ang&eacute;lique Delange (the perky, multitalented Isabelle Carr&eacute;) cannot cope with relating to people: she is a shy young student in a chocolate class taught by M. Mercier (Claude Aufaure) who rises to the top of her class as a chocolatier winning employment in the finest chocolate business in France when suddenly M. Mercier dies.  Ang&eacute;lique is without a job and is terrified of interviewing (she belongs to a group therapy session called Romantics Anonymous where the group shares their flaws in relating to people.  She sees and interview slot for a candy business owned by Jean-Ren&eacute; Van Den Hugde (Benot Poelvoorde) - a man who is terrified of women as he works through sessions with his therapist (St&eacute;phan Wojtowicz).  Ang&eacute;lique's interview goes well and she is hired on the spot - as a sales rep!Through a series of trial and error Ang&eacute;lique wins the friendship of the small staff (Lorella Cravotta, Lise Lam&eacute;trie, Swann Arlaud, and Pierre Niney) who understand the business is going bankrupt and together they stage a lessons on chocolate making that results is the staff learning all the secrets for the now defunct Mercier Chocolates.  Ang&eacute;lique and  Jean-Ren&eacute; seem to find an attraction to each other but their emotional timidity prevents them from connecting until a big break comes:  the business is chosen to attend the chocolate prize competition and in the midst of the trip the two seem to overcome their handicaps.

As a quirky romantic comedy, the film plays out exactly as you might anticipate.  From a plotting standpoint, it offers little new.  And yet, the film and its stars are just so likable and, dare I say, charming.  Despite my intellectual reservations and the feeling that I'd seen this narrative a hundred times, I still was completely won over by the movie's eccentric sweetness.  Is it a great movie?  Is it a classic I will reflect on in a dozen years?  Perhaps not.  But for now, I will put aside my cynicism and admit it.  I loved ""Romantics Anonymous!""  There, I've said it and I won't be ashamed any longer.  My brain tells me this is a four star movie, but my heart is going all out with the highest recommendation.  It's sweet, funny, and just odd enough to seem refreshingly different.  And did I mention how charming it was?  Maybe I've grown soft in my old age.Jean-Pierre Ameris' film introduces us to a pair of central characters with enough quirks and nervous tics to make one wonder how they've achieved any success in the modern world.  When playing up movie eccentricity, many comedy films overburden their story lines with contrivance.  ""Romantics Anonymous"" walks a fine line without disengaging the audience, and this dance of social ineptitude delivers genuine sweetness and amusement.  Benoit Poelvoorde plays the head of a chocolate factory that has fallen on hard times.  In addition to his business dilemma, he is battling an inability to really connect with others in a meaningful way.  Isabelle Carre plays a talented candy maker riddled with shyness and an emotional sensitivity that causes her to ""feel too much.""  When she gets a job at the factory, might she be its unwitting savior?  Might the two be soul mates?  Can love conquer all?  I don't suppose any of the answers will come as a major surprise.And yet, the movie is all but irresistible.  Carre is an absolute delight as she tries to conquer her hesitancy with self affirmations and songs.  It's an astute comedic performance.  And Poelvoorde brings a necessary relatability to his role.  As written, it is a role that could have been quite alienating, but I was always rooting for this troubled duo to push past the manufactured barriers of their relationship.  Even though the film took me down a very familiar path, it was a journey that was well worth taking.  If you like this type of film, ""Romantics Anonymous"" takes a tired premise and makes it seem new again.  A smart script and winning performances distinguish this from the pack.

So much has been lost or forgotten by the American film industry that most attempts coming out of Hollywood incorporate elements of other genres just to attract an audience. And irrespective of the mandatory high profile talent, slick marketing and overplayed sentimental chicanery - they invariably fail.Leave it to the French to show how it's done.Tells the story of Jean-R&eacute;ne and Ang&eacute;lique, a pair of wallflowers who have two things in common - a deep love of chocolate and an intense inability to foment any kind of meaningful human relationship. Each suffers from shyness so intense that Ang&eacute;lique passes out when any situation causes even a mild rise in her blood pressure and Jean-R&eacute;ne's constant companion is a business briefcase filled with extra shirts due to uncontrollable sweating.A quiet beauty, Ang&eacute;lique has an amazing ability to create some of the most delicate and tasty chocolate treats. But she's incapable of even the mildest interaction with other people, so she chooses to hide behind the fac&agrave;de of a more famous chef. Despite the lack of recognition or respect, for her it's perfection; allowing her to be a chocolatier while remaining completely free from any faint-inducing situations. It's a happy, if solitary, life that she leads for seven years - until the sad unexpected passing of her friend and professional front.She's finally forced to enter a world of unavoidable human contact. With the help of a support group of similarly afflicted people bolstering her inner fortitude, she takes her first steps out of a sheltered lonely existence. And the perfect opportunity has arisen - a job opening at a small out-of-the-way chocolate company.Jean-R&eacute;ne helms a once grand compagnie de chocolat, sadly now only a shallow shell of its former glory. Because he's psychologically adamant to any alteration in the patterns of his existence - it also means he's incapable of change. But change is coming whether he wants it or not. Due to falling sales, the company and its loyal long-time employees are on the brink being thrown to the streets. They're desperate. So, in a last ditch attempt to stave off bankruptcy, he's opted to hire a sales rep to hawk their products.Guess who shows up to apply?As each character tries to take those first daunting steps back into Life, watching them face their fears, it's the equivalent of asking an acrophobic to walk a high wire without a net - pretty darn scary. But their blossoming romance is just so sweet and their personal risks so high, it yields a wonderfully tender and excruciatingly funny film as Jean-R&eacute;ne and Ang&eacute;lique take those awesome leaps of faith for love.Personal Notes:- Rented because of Benot Poelvoorde, whom I first screened in another absolutely fantastic comedy - 'Nothing To Declare'. If you enjoy 'Anonymous', I strongly urge you to take a chance on 'Declare'.- Unfortunately, I can already see some pathetic Hollywood-ized version completely gutting this amazing film. They'll do some PowerPoint presentations, pay tons to consultants for focus groups made up of donut-gobbling non-cinephiles, hire ridiculously overpaid talent, and utterly destroy the magic that is this production.

It is beautifully made and it keeps a very 'light and bright' atmosphere throughout. The storyline is entertaining and different. Not your average 'meet and fall in love' movie.We found ourselves laughing several times throughout the movie.Since it is rated NR for now, I will let you know there is no nudity. There is one semi-sex scene in the movie when the lead character walks into her apartment and two visitors are using her apartment. No nudity, but a few seconds of sexual noise and action. Not enough that I didn't let my teen watch it. I say all that just in case there are parents who are wondering about the NR rating and allowing their children to see it.I was sad when the movie ended because it was such a happy carefree movie to watch.
