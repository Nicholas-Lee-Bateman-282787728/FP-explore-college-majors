204410,A28MYC8KKCK2FZ,6300183998,Alice L. Moore,"[2, 4]","This is an entertaining costume drama.  The biggest plus is Richard Burton.  He is also the biggest minus.  As Henry VIII he seems to overwhelm Genevieve Bujold as Anne Boleyn.  In fact there seems to be no on screen chemistry between the two actors.  This is the single biggest drawback of the film.Anthony Quayle as Cardinal Wolsey is first rate.  With his portrayal he shows us in the 20th/21st century he is equivalent to an over comfortable CEO wanting to retain his perquisites than a man of God.  You still feel for him when he is dispossesed of his holdings as Henry VIII becomes head of the Church.John Colicos portrays Thomas Cromwell(not Oliver!!!) well.  He transitioned smoothly from the Cardinal's right hand man to Henry VIII's.  This actor was much more subtle as a heavy in this movie than in other roles(Klingon Commander in Star Trek, Gaius Baltar in the Original Battlestar Galactica).The two principals seemed to be uttering their lines more for prosperity than each other; another drawback.  If you're not versed in this period of history, it is difficult to follow.  It does seem to suffer by comparison to the new Showtime series ""The Tudors"".  The new series, if you watch it from the beginning, you can follow it without being versed in history.However, anything with Richard Burton is worth watching.",3,A good costume drama,1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,1327,"['entertaining', 'costume', 'drama', 'biggest', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'also', 'biggest', 'minus', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'overwhelm', 'Genevieve', 'Bujold', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'fact', 'there', 'be', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'two', 'actors', 'single', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'film.Anthony', 'Quayle', 'Cardinal', 'Wolsey', 'first', 'rate', 'portrayal', '20th/21st', 'century', 'equivalent', 'comfortable', 'CEO', 'wanting', 'retain', 'perquisites', 'man', 'God', 'still', 'feel', 'when', 'dispossesed', 'holdings', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'head', 'Church.John', 'Colicos', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'not', 'Oliver', 'well', 'transitioned', 'smoothly', 'Cardinal', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'actor', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'heavy', 'movie', 'other', 'roles', 'Klingon', 'Commander', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Gaius', 'Baltar', 'Original', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', '.The', 'two', 'principals', 'seemed', 'be', 'uttering', 'lines', 'more', 'prosperity', 'other', 'drawback', ""'re"", 'not', 'versed', 'period', 'history', 'difficult', 'follow', 'seem', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'new', 'Showtime', 'series', 'Tudors', 'new', 'series', 'watch', 'beginning', 'can', 'follow', 'being', 'versed', 'history.However', 'anything', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
204411,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6300183998,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","I suppose by now everyone knows the basic story of Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry the Eighth. It was for her that Henry defied the Pope and divorced (or was it annulled?) Catherine of Aragon. She was the mother of Elizabeth, whom she predicted would be the greatest queen of England, despite the fact that Henry went on to have four more wives. None produced a male heir.Of course the story is full of court intrigue, with marvelous settings and costumes, but the only important thing you need to know is that Henry is played by Richard Burton and Anne by Genevieve Bujold. They are electric, both in their passion and their power struggles. Actually, it was more his passion and her power struggles. As we all know, she was beheaded on a trumped-up charge of treason by adultery, including accusations of incest with her brother. But like most things in that era (1533 to 1536) it was all politics.After all, Henry had been married to his older brother's widow Catherine, and there was a big question as to whether her marriage had ever been consummated. Indeed, it is widely assumed that the sickly Arthur, who died at the age of 15, had been incapable of consummating his marriage. But as Henry later explained it to Anne, it was not a marriage of Catherine and Henry, but a marriage of England and Spain. Indeed, he apparently loathed Catherine from the start.It's a good rendering of a very familiar story, but its very familiarity gives it only four stars instead of five.",4,Beautiful Historical Romance,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,1481,"['suppose', 'now', 'everyone', 'basic', 'story', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'second', 'wife', 'Henry', 'Eighth', 'was', 'Henry', 'defied', 'Pope', 'divorced', 'was', 'annulled', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'was', 'mother', 'Elizabeth', 'whom', 'predicted', 'would', 'be', 'greatest', 'queen', 'England', 'fact', 'Henry', 'went', 'have', 'four', 'more', 'wives', 'None', 'produced', 'male', 'heir.Of', 'course', 'story', 'full', 'court', 'intrigue', 'marvelous', 'settings', 'costumes', 'only', 'important', 'thing', 'need', 'know', 'Henry', 'played', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Anne', 'Genevieve', 'Bujold', 'are', 'electric', 'passion', 'power', 'struggles', 'Actually', 'was', 'more', 'passion', 'power', 'struggles', 'know', 'was', 'beheaded', 'trumped-up', 'charge', 'treason', 'adultery', 'including', 'accusations', 'incest', 'brother', 'most', 'things', 'era', '1533', '1536', 'was', 'politics.After', 'Henry', 'had', 'been', 'married', 'older', 'brother', 'widow', 'Catherine', 'there', 'was', 'big', 'question', 'marriage', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'consummated', 'Indeed', 'widely', 'assumed', 'sickly', 'Arthur', 'who', 'died', 'age', '15', 'had', 'been', 'incapable', 'consummating', 'marriage', 'Henry', 'later', 'explained', 'Anne', 'was', 'not', 'marriage', 'Catherine', 'Henry', 'marriage', 'England', 'Spain', 'Indeed', 'apparently', 'loathed', 'Catherine', 'start.It', 'good', 'rendering', 'very', 'familiar', 'story', 'very', 'familiarity', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five']",N/A

204415,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6300183998,Deborah Earle,"[11, 13]","This movie, based on the 1948 play by Maxwell Anderson, owes much of its success to the popularity of the Tudor England film genre of the mid-to late 1960s, of which it is a part.It is a fine, gracefully portrayed, albeit sometimes inaccurate account of the life of the mother of Queen Elizabeth I. In the title role, Quebequoise Genevive Bujold is the quintessential Anne Boleyn, whose slight French accent comes nicely into play, as Anne had just returned from the French Court when she first appears onscreen. Bujold gives a lot of strenghth and dignity to the role, happily without the neck tumour and extra digit on her right hand like the real Anne. One major accuracy portrayed in the film is that Anne originally wanted nothing to do with Henry.Richard Burton is a beefy-looking Henry VIII, a bit slimmer than most actors I've seen in the role. With his lovely, lyrical Welsh accent, he captures much of Henry's nuances and temperment, and the scene of him dancing the galliard with Anne is particularly seductive.Valerie Gearon captures the sense of betrayal and frustration that must have been experienced by the real Mary Boleyn when the King casts her aside, and her story is an interesting footnote in this drama. Sir Michael Hordern, as Thomas Boleyn comes across as both an amoral man willing to sell his wife and daughters into the King's concubinage to advance his position, and also as someone who is a bit intimidated by Henry.Anthony Quayle's Cardinal Wolsey is a cold, impersonal schemer, and immoral churchman who acts as the King's procurer. Terence Wilton's spurned Harry Percy looks to have been a more suitable match for Anne, but unfortunately, the King thwarted their plans for marriage.John Colicos'Cromwell is the ultimate snake-in-the-grass lawyer, who succeeds in making the King's power absolute, which would ultimately be to his own detriment.Solemn Irene Papas bears little resemblance to the real Catherine of Aragon, but emphasizes the spurned Queen's piety and firmness in the face of her ordeal. Nicola Paget as her daughter, Mary has a brief scene at her deathbed. But in reality, when Anne became Queen, the only condition under which Catherine could see her daughter was if she admitted that her marriage to the King was invalid. So mother and daughter never saw each other again.Another point of interest in the movie was when Anne asked that the lives of Henry's adversaries be spared, she gives birth to a living child; later, when she does the opposite, she gives birth to a still born son.Things soon come to a head for this noblewoman who became ensnared in the King's lair originally through no will of her own, but who suffered greatly when she finally accepted Henry when the King becomes enamored of Jane Seymour, and Anne becomes a political liabity. The reenactment of Anne's arrest on trumped-up charges of treason is not accurate. But the scene of Anne's final moments with Elizabeth is very poignant.Gary Bond's Mark Smeaton is a pityable charcter as the court musician tortured into a confession of adultery with Anne. Michael Johnson's George Boleyn, Anne's wrongfully convicted brother, displays a certain gutsiness when he tells off Cromwell during the trial for his life. As was the case with his impregnated daughter, Mary, we see Thomas Boleyn once more turn his back on a teary-eyed daughter in order to keep the King's favor during the trial.The final confrontation scene between Anne and Henry is fictitious, but it provides a great piece of acting. The speech Anne made before her execution is mercifully deleted; there is no place for her to praise the King who was having her executed in this production.One wonders about the significance of the theme of Anne's Thousand Days in the years just after the 1,000-day Kennedy Administration ended tragically.Placed in historically accurate settings, filled with regal pomp and splendor, and costumes in colors that were fashionable at the time of its release, ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" enthralls a viewer with its story, and Anne's prediction of her daughter's glorious future in her abscence reminds us that destiny, even in the face of the scheming brutality of a powerful King, can be greater than any of us know.",4,....And My Blood Will Have Been Well Spent,1017792000,"04 3, 2002",2002,4234,"['movie', 'based', '1948', 'play', 'Maxwell', 'Anderson', 'owes', 'much', 'success', 'popularity', 'Tudor', 'England', 'film', 'genre', 'mid-to', 'late', '1960s', 'part.It', 'fine', 'gracefully', 'portrayed', 'sometimes', 'inaccurate', 'account', 'life', 'mother', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'title', 'role', 'Quebequoise', 'Genevive', 'Bujold', 'quintessential', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'slight', 'French', 'accent', 'nicely', 'play', 'Anne', 'had', 'just', 'returned', 'French', 'Court', 'when', 'first', 'onscreen', 'Bujold', 'lot', 'strenghth', 'dignity', 'role', 'happily', 'neck', 'tumour', 'extra', 'digit', 'right', 'hand', 'real', 'Anne', 'One', 'major', 'accuracy', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Anne', 'originally', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'do', 'Henry.Richard', 'Burton', 'beefy-looking', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'bit', 'slimmer', 'most', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'role', 'lovely', 'lyrical', 'Welsh', 'accent', 'much', 'Henry', 'nuances', 'temperment', 'scene', 'dancing', 'galliard', 'Anne', 'particularly', 'seductive.Valerie', 'Gearon', 'sense', 'betrayal', 'frustration', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'experienced', 'real', 'Mary', 'Boleyn', 'when', 'King', 'aside', 'story', 'interesting', 'footnote', 'drama', 'Sir', 'Michael', 'Hordern', 'Thomas', 'Boleyn', 'amoral', 'man', 'willing', 'sell', 'wife', 'daughters', 'King', 'concubinage', 'advance', 'position', 'also', 'someone', 'who', 'bit', 'intimidated', 'Henry.Anthony', 'Quayle', 'Cardinal', 'Wolsey', 'cold', 'impersonal', 'schemer', 'immoral', 'churchman', 'who', 'King', 'procurer', 'Terence', 'Wilton', 'spurned', 'Harry', 'Percy', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suitable', 'match', 'Anne', 'unfortunately', 'King', 'thwarted', 'plans', 'marriage.John', ""Colicos'Cromwell"", 'ultimate', 'snake-in-the-grass', 'lawyer', 'who', 'making', 'King', 'power', 'absolute', 'would', 'ultimately', 'be', 'own', 'detriment.Solemn', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'little', 'resemblance', 'real', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'spurned', 'Queen', 'piety', 'firmness', 'face', 'ordeal', 'Nicola', 'Paget', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'brief', 'scene', 'deathbed', 'reality', 'when', 'Anne', 'became', 'Queen', 'only', 'condition', 'Catherine', 'could', 'see', 'daughter', 'was', 'admitted', 'marriage', 'King', 'was', 'invalid', 'mother', 'daughter', 'never', 'saw', 'other', 'again.Another', 'point', 'interest', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Anne', 'asked', 'lives', 'Henry', 'adversaries', 'be', 'spared', 'birth', 'living', 'child', 'later', 'when', 'opposite', 'birth', 'still', 'born', 'son.Things', 'soon', 'come', 'head', 'noblewoman', 'who', 'became', 'ensnared', 'King', 'lair', 'originally', 'will', 'own', 'who', 'suffered', 'greatly', 'when', 'finally', 'accepted', 'Henry', 'when', 'King', 'becomes', 'enamored', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Anne', 'political', 'liabity', 'reenactment', 'Anne', 'arrest', 'trumped-up', 'charges', 'treason', 'not', 'accurate', 'scene', 'Anne', 'final', 'moments', 'Elizabeth', 'very', 'poignant.Gary', 'Bond', 'Mark', 'Smeaton', 'pityable', 'charcter', 'court', 'musician', 'tortured', 'confession', 'adultery', 'Anne', 'Michael', 'Johnson', 'George', 'Boleyn', 'Anne', 'wrongfully', 'convicted', 'brother', 'certain', 'gutsiness', 'when', 'off', 'Cromwell', 'trial', 'life', 'was', 'case', 'impregnated', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'see', 'Thomas', 'Boleyn', 'once', 'more', 'turn', 'back', 'teary-eyed', 'daughter', 'order', 'keep', 'King', 'favor', 'trial.The', 'final', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'Anne', 'Henry', 'fictitious', 'great', 'piece', 'acting', 'speech', 'Anne', 'made', 'execution', 'mercifully', 'deleted', 'place', 'praise', 'King', 'who', 'was', 'having', 'executed', 'production.One', 'significance', 'theme', 'Anne', 'Thousand', 'Days', 'years', 'just', '1,000-day', 'Kennedy', 'Administration', 'ended', 'tragically.Placed', 'historically', 'accurate', 'settings', 'filled', 'regal', 'pomp', 'splendor', 'costumes', 'colors', 'were', 'fashionable', 'time', 'release', 'Anne', 'Thousand', 'Days', 'viewer', 'story', 'Anne', 'prediction', 'daughter', 'glorious', 'future', 'abscence', 'destiny', 'even', 'face', 'scheming', 'brutality', 'powerful', 'King', 'can', 'be', 'greater', 'know']",N/A

She was so young but delivered a powerful performance as Anne Boleyn, one of the many wives of Henry VIII. According to the film, Anne and Henry were passionately in love, but in order to wed, Henry had to get out of his previous marriage, which he did by leaving the Catholic church and creating the Church of England in order to procure a divorce. Henry and Anne wed, and they seemed to be happy enough until Anne kept delivering children who were girls. Henry became obsessed with having an heir to the throne, and kept insisting that she produce an heir. She earnestly wanted to, and as time went on, Henry's anger and resentment toward Anne grew, until finally he wanted to take a new wife and had Anne sentenced to death. Eventually she was beheaded.

The cinematography is beautiful, the costumes are lush and magnificent, and the acting is superlative. Richard Burton, in the role of King Henry VIII, is superb, as his velvet voice mesmerizes the viewer. Genevieve Bujold, wonderful in the title role of the  notorious Anne Boleyn, plays her part intelligently and with great presence. Irene Papas plays the role of the wronged Queen, Katherine of Aragon, with suitable pathos. Anthony Quayle is wonderful in the role of Cardinal Wolsey, prelate of the church and chancellor of England, who eventually was brought low by Anne Boleyn. John Colicos does a remarkable job with the role of the ambitious Cromwell, who, regretably, would stop at nothing, even torture and murder, to see that his King got what he wanted.While not historically accurate, it is still a sublime historical drama. It centers around Anne Boleyn's rise to prominence and her ultimate demise at the executioner's sword. While at court one day, she catches the King's eye. She, however, is in love with a courtier whom she is to marry. The King, besotted by her, refuses to grant her permission to marry, and her courtier is forced to marry another. The King pursues Anne, while still married to the aging Katherine. Anne refuses to give in and become his lover, knowing that once she does, she will be yesterday's news. Holding Cardinal Wolsey responsible for the loss of all her hopes and dreams, she plays him like a fiddle, eventually bringing about his downfall. With Cromwell on the ascendancy, however, little does Anne know her troubles are just beginning.Angry at the turn her life has taken, Anne becomes a doyenne of intrigue and, as with Wolsey, also plays the King like a fiddle, setting into motion the events that would bring about the great Reformation, which would transform England from a Catholic country into a Protestant one.  While she finally succeeds in marrying the King, she fails to produce the son that Henry VIII so desires, though the fault is Henry's and not hers, as we now know that it is the male who determines the sex of a child. The terms of Anne's reign would cost her dearly and her legacy would be a bloody one. What had started out with high hopes would end tragically for her and set a precedent that would make all future wives fearful of coming to the same end. Ironically, Henry would never know that his child with Anne would become the greatest monarch that England has ever known, Elizabeth I.This Is a film that all lovers of period pieces and historical dramas will enjoy.

Certainly cultural changes have modified this interesting story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn vintage late 1960's to the sex and slaughter version recently seen on cable TV's The Tudors.It would seem Richard Burton's bellowing Henry is a perfect choice for the evil King and his desire to spawn a male heir.  I thought Genevieve Bujold was also a good choice for Anne.  Equally conniving in her own efforts to keep Henry from wandering and their daughter Elizabeth in line for the throne, Anne has a moral conviction her husband lacks.Director Charles Jarrott keeps the audience focused on the 2 principal characters and the brief marriage.  So from my perspective the tensions and cruelty are understood if not agreed with.  The issue of lineage is compounded because of Henry's existing marriage to Catherine and their daughter.  Thus he just starts his own church, discounting the Pope's influence over his kingdom.Still, the movie plods along for nearly 2  hours, often dissipating into soapish melodrama.

And  this film could be perceived as one of those annoying films.

204437,A22F3BWM7RAHDA,6300183998,P. B. Sharp,"[0, 0]","A feast for the eyes as well as the heart, this gorgeous film has it all. Genevieve Bujold brings piquancy and mischief to Anne as well as her well known courage, spirit and wit. It is really a delectable performance that is so good it sets the hallmark for portrayals of the Queen who gained the world and lost it. But not her heritage, Elizabeth. Richard Burton's Henry is a fine performance, too of the world's most famous king, a complex combination of passion, cruelty, selfishness and vulnerability. His appearance in the Tower when Anne was there awaiting execution is fictional, but Henry in the movie wants to hear from Anne's own lips that she betrayed him by adultery. Anne, also fictionally, lays it on thick, that of course she cuckolded Henry with many men. Anne wins this little drama as Henry can't stand any aspirations cast upon his manhood.There are so many authentic touches in this carefully crafted film. For instance, just before Anne's execution you see two men carrying an oblong box. Historically that was an arrow box which held Anne's body, no coffin being provided. Also the executioner had to trick Anne to look in the right direction so the sword would be aligned. That also is correct history, with Anne kneeling upright, not with her head on a block. Thomas More remarked that he needed help climbing up the scaffold stairs but ""as for my coming down I shall shift or myself.""Anthony Quayle as the beleaguered Cardinal Woolsey brings him to life, his face sweating, he seems to droop under his brilliant red robes when he cannot engineer Henry's divorce while outwardly putting on the best face he can. Although in a relatively small part, Irene Papas is a fine Katherine of Aragon, stubborn and fighting  for her daughter Mary's rights as Henry's heir. Ironically, though, the real Katherine had red-blonde hair and probably a lighter complexion than the swarthy Papas and the swarthy Anne Boleyn. Thomas Cromwell ably played by John Colicos even looks like the real McCoy as he undermines Anne, setting in place the mechanisms that will bring her down. The film is richly rewarding leaving you somewhat breathless but content as Anne voice is heard while the little Elizabeth walks away alone:""My Elizabeth shall be Queen and my blood will have been well spent.""",5,A magnificent spectacle!,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,2297,"['feast', 'eyes', 'as', 'well', 'heart', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'Genevieve', 'Bujold', 'piquancy', 'mischief', 'Anne', 'as', 'well', 'well', 'known', 'courage', 'spirit', 'wit', 'really', 'delectable', 'performance', 'so', 'good', 'hallmark', 'portrayals', 'Queen', 'who', 'gained', 'world', 'lost', 'not', 'heritage', 'Elizabeth', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Henry', 'fine', 'performance', 'too', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'king', 'complex', 'combination', 'passion', 'cruelty', 'selfishness', 'vulnerability', 'appearance', 'Tower', 'when', 'Anne', 'was', 'awaiting', 'execution', 'fictional', 'Henry', 'movie', 'hear', 'Anne', 'own', 'lips', 'betrayed', 'adultery', 'Anne', 'also', 'fictionally', 'thick', 'course', 'cuckolded', 'Henry', 'many', 'men', 'Anne', 'little', 'drama', 'Henry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'aspirations', 'cast', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'authentic', 'touches', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'film', 'instance', 'just', 'Anne', 'execution', 'see', 'two', 'men', 'carrying', 'oblong', 'box', 'Historically', 'was', 'arrow', 'box', 'held', 'Anne', 'body', 'coffin', 'being', 'provided', 'Also', 'executioner', 'had', 'trick', 'Anne', 'look', 'right', 'direction', 'sword', 'would', 'be', 'aligned', 'also', 'correct', 'history', 'Anne', 'kneeling', 'upright', 'not', 'head', 'block', 'Thomas', 'More', 'remarked', 'needed', 'help', 'climbing', 'up', 'scaffold', 'stairs', 'coming', 'down', 'shall', 'shift', 'Anthony', 'Quayle', 'beleaguered', 'Cardinal', 'Woolsey', 'life', 'face', 'sweating', 'droop', 'brilliant', 'red', 'robes', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'engineer', 'Henry', 'divorce', 'outwardly', 'putting', 'best', 'face', 'can', 'relatively', 'small', 'part', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'fine', 'Katherine', 'Aragon', 'stubborn', 'fighting', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'rights', 'Henry', 'heir', 'Ironically', 'though', 'real', 'Katherine', 'had', 'red-blonde', 'hair', 'probably', 'lighter', 'complexion', 'swarthy', 'Papas', 'swarthy', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'ably', 'played', 'John', 'Colicos', 'even', 'real', 'McCoy', 'Anne', 'setting', 'place', 'mechanisms', 'will', 'bring', 'down', 'film', 'richly', 'rewarding', 'leaving', 'somewhat', 'breathless', 'content', 'Anne', 'voice', 'heard', 'little', 'Elizabeth', 'away', 'alone', 'Elizabeth', 'shall', 'be', 'Queen', 'blood', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'spent']",N/A

204439,A5ZUZ49YRDPCV,6300183998,Rachel Garret,"[4, 5]","1969: Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold sizzled the screen with all the drama of the intense relationship between Henry the 8th and Anne Boylen, two of English royal history's most notorious figures. The powerful drama on film is excellent, worthy of Oscar s, as one reviewer commented. Sadly, it was overlooked and underrated. Through my review and based on the comments by others, I intend to prove it was a sublimely dramatic film that was at its time Oscar worthy.The compelling story focuses on the love affair between Henry the 8th and Anne Boylen, the former handmaiden of his first wife Catherine of Aragon (Irene Papas in a great performance). In order to divorce Catherine, who had not born him  a male heir and had become tiresome to King Henry, the capricious monarch broke all ties with the Vatican Roman Catholic Church and made himself the head of the Church of England. This deed done, he was free to marry Anne Boylen. Although the initial chemistry and romance blossomed (despite the May-December relationship), Henry the 8th was soon vexed and weary of Anne. Once again, he would remarry. The principal motive for Henry the 8th's repeated marriages (six wives in total) was dynastic. He desperately wanted a son to perpetuate the Tudor bloodline. The more historically accurate account, which has fired the imagination of writers, playwrights, opera composers (Donizetti's first success was an opera about Anne Boylen), is very different from the much dramatized fictional account, although not entirely.When Catherine of Aragon succeeded in having one daughter who survived, Henry the 8th looked around for another woman to suplant her, a woman who would give him a son. He chose Anne Boylen. After the laborious process of breaking up with the Vatican Roman Catholic Church and heading his own Church of England, Henry was granted divorce from Catherine and  married the already pregnant Anne Boylen. Anne gave birth to a daughter, the future queen Elizabeth and England's most illustrious queen. Unfortunately for Anne, her first child was followed by a series of tragic miscarriages. As Henry wanted a son, it was her failure to give him an heir that lead to her downfall.Through the diabolical schemes of such prominent figures as Thomas Cromwell (Calico also in a great supporting role), Henry the 8th managed to put Anne in a precarious situation. He accused her of betrayal and adultery (allegations which have never been confirmed) and brought her to trial. When Catherine of Aragon died, Anne Boylen was reported saying, ""I am her death as she is mine."" Thomas Cromwell handled the trial and sentenced Anne to death. Also condemned to death were Anne's brother Rochefort, a court musician named Smeaton and three others who were considered part of the adulterous conspiracy. They were killed before Anne, who waited for her own execution on May 19, 1536. The following day Henry married Jane Seymour.",5,A Thousand Hands In Applause For A Powerful Drama,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,2931,"['1969', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Genevieve', 'Bujold', 'sizzled', 'screen', 'drama', 'intense', 'relationship', 'Henry', '8th', 'Anne', 'Boylen', 'two', 'English', 'royal', 'history', 'most', 'notorious', 'figures', 'powerful', 'drama', 'film', 'excellent', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 's', 'one', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'Sadly', 'was', 'overlooked', 'underrated', 'review', 'based', 'comments', 'others', 'intend', 'prove', 'was', 'sublimely', 'dramatic', 'film', 'was', 'time', 'Oscar', 'worthy.The', 'compelling', 'story', 'focuses', 'love', 'affair', 'Henry', '8th', 'Anne', 'Boylen', 'former', 'handmaiden', 'first', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'great', 'performance', 'order', 'divorce', 'Catherine', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'born', 'male', 'heir', 'had', 'become', 'tiresome', 'King', 'Henry', 'capricious', 'monarch', 'broke', 'ties', 'Vatican', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'made', 'head', 'Church', 'England', 'deed', 'done', 'was', 'free', 'marry', 'Anne', 'Boylen', 'initial', 'chemistry', 'romance', 'blossomed', 'May-December', 'relationship', 'Henry', '8th', 'was', 'soon', 'vexed', 'weary', 'Anne', 'Once', 'again', 'would', 'remarry', 'principal', 'motive', 'Henry', '8th', 'repeated', 'marriages', 'six', 'wives', 'total', 'was', 'dynastic', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'son', 'perpetuate', 'Tudor', 'bloodline', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'account', 'fired', 'imagination', 'writers', 'playwrights', 'opera', 'composers', 'Donizetti', 'first', 'success', 'was', 'opera', 'Anne', 'Boylen', 'very', 'different', 'much', 'dramatized', 'fictional', 'account', 'not', 'entirely.When', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'succeeded', 'having', 'one', 'daughter', 'who', 'survived', 'Henry', '8th', 'looked', 'woman', 'suplant', 'woman', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'son', 'chose', 'Anne', 'Boylen', 'laborious', 'process', 'breaking', 'up', 'Vatican', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'heading', 'own', 'Church', 'England', 'Henry', 'was', 'granted', 'divorce', 'Catherine', 'married', 'already', 'pregnant', 'Anne', 'Boylen', 'Anne', 'gave', 'birth', 'daughter', 'future', 'queen', 'Elizabeth', 'England', 'most', 'illustrious', 'queen', 'Unfortunately', 'Anne', 'first', 'child', 'was', 'followed', 'series', 'tragic', 'miscarriages', 'Henry', 'wanted', 'son', 'was', 'failure', 'give', 'heir', 'lead', 'diabolical', 'schemes', 'such', 'prominent', 'figures', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'Calico', 'also', 'great', 'supporting', 'role', 'Henry', '8th', 'managed', 'put', 'Anne', 'precarious', 'situation', 'accused', 'betrayal', 'adultery', 'allegations', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'confirmed', 'brought', 'trial', 'When', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'died', 'Anne', 'Boylen', 'was', 'reported', 'saying', 'am', 'death', 'mine', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'handled', 'trial', 'sentenced', 'Anne', 'death', 'Also', 'condemned', 'death', 'were', 'Anne', 'brother', 'Rochefort', 'court', 'musician', 'named', 'Smeaton', 'three', 'others', 'who', 'were', 'considered', 'part', 'adulterous', 'conspiracy', 'were', 'killed', 'before', 'Anne', 'who', 'waited', 'own', 'execution', 'May', '19', '1536', 'following', 'day', 'Henry', 'married', 'Jane', 'Seymour']",N/A

Both Bujold and Burton are lovely onscreen whereas, their real life counterparts were not.  But we can't very well have a Hollywood movie with plain looking leads can we?  This a beautiful movie to watch, and both of the leads play their roles very well.  The chemistry between them is electrifying and the roller coaster ride that was Henry and Anne's tempestuous relationship is well portrayed here.  Yes, there are inaccuracies, but who cares?  Once you get engrossed in this film, it won't matter.  Bujold brings the fiery and cunning Anne Boleyn to life in a believable and honest way.  She is not shy about exposing Anne's faults.  Her jealousy, nagging, teasing, and enormous ambition are all laid bare here.  And this just makes her human, a real person rather than a footnote in a history text.  That is why it is all the more heartbreaking when the film reaches it's tragic end.  The last scene shows a small Elizabeth, later to become Queen Elizabeth I, with a voice over by Bujold proclaiming that one day her daughter would be queen, and her blood &quot;will have been well spent.&quot;  It is a very touching end to a pleasing film.",4,Wonderful Performances!

204442,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6300183998,Simon Davis,"[12, 13]","History buffs, lovers of Tudor England, and historical dramas in general could not help but be impressed by this magnificent production that is rich in detail, characterisation, historical research and perfect contemporary backdrops. I know it has always been an absolute favourite of mine among all the fine historical films produced in the late 1960's and early 1970's.""Anne Of The Thousand Days"" despite a few strayings from the historical truths, at times is a painstakingly researched production that tries to always be as accurate as possible in its retelling of the tragic rise and fall of the fascinating Anne Boleyn, second wife of King Henry VIII. Tudor England was a time of great beauty, savagery, religious upheaval and pagentry and this is all captured beautifully in this film. Indeed ""Anne Of The Thousand Days"" is a visual and indeed intellectual feast for the eyes and the brain. Towering above the whole massive production here is Genevieve Bujold in the role of a life time as Anne Boleyn. Never has she been so perfectly cast as here. During the course of the film she develops from the simple girl just arrived back in England from her time at the stylish French court, who catches the eye of the England's august and rather frightening monarch, to that of  being England's Queen who must live by her own wits alone if she is to survive in such unsure times. It is a stunning performance filled with equal amounts of fire, passion, sorrow, wit and spirit. The character of Anne is well researched here and Bujold rightly won an Academy Award Nomination for her performance here. Richard Burton had his last real stand out role as Henry VIII in this production. Many famous actors have portrayed Henry on stage and screen and Keith Michell's superb portrayal of the king was still ahead in the future when this film was made. Burton is wonderfully believable as Henry and fits the part like a glove with equal parts, majestic presence, selfishness, cruelty and great passion, just how this most famous of monarch's is envisioned. Burton also received an Academy Award Nomination for his colourful and beautifully balanced performance and his Henry has rightly joined the few who are deservedly remembered for their portrayals, Charles Laughton and Keith Michell in particular.""Anne Of The Thousand Days' is rich in wonderful performances from Michael Hordern and Katherine Blake as Thomas and Elizabeth Boleyn, Anne's parents to Anthony Quayle in a superb performance of world weary splendour as the infamous Cardinal Wolsey. William Squire as Thomas More and Joseph O'Conor as Archbishop Fisher, two men bound up in all the tragic tumult of Henry's Reformation and who were sacrificed for Anne's sake also excel. Irene Papas portrays Henry's first wife Catherine of Aragon and while her very dark appearance perhaps fails to match the Red/Gold hair and pale complexion of the real Catherine, she is very impressive in her brief scenes as Henry's cast off wife who fought him all the way by refusing to grant him the divorce he eagerly sought thus bringing on the English Reformation. In a small but standout role Valerie Gearon plays Mary Boleyn, Anne's older sister and former mistress of Henry. While their relationship was historical fact in the film she is portrayed carrying Henry's child. That fictional development aside her's is a wonderful performance filled with the anger and uselessness felt by many women in the man's world of Tudor England.The film is full of wonderful moments. Two standouts are Anne's triumphal procession through London where she is greeted by the jeers and insults of an outraged population who thought of her as a whore and her final speech to Henry in the Tower (fictional but carried of with finesse) prior to her execution where she gives nothing away to him and declares that ""her blood will be well spent"" and predicts that ""her daughter (Elizabeth) will become a greater Queen than England has ever known. Stirring stuff and Genevieve Bujold makes the most of such a juicy part. The period flavour is caught beautifully and for all its brutality the Tudor period was sumptous in costumes, interior decoration, garden design etc. These are all faithfully reproduced in ""Anne Of The Thousand Days"" to maximum effect and the film is a gorgeous feast for the eyes.For any student of Tudor history this film is a must see. I love it for its sterling attempt within the confines of popular entertainment to tell the story as it was. Production values are top notch and one feels the spirit of that young Boleyn girl who unwillingly found herself thrust into the historical spotlight, and who  became a woman in the process, in each frame of Bujold's performance.",5,England's dazzling Tudor Queen,1039046400,"12 5, 2002",2002,4720,"['History', 'buffs', 'lovers', 'Tudor', 'England', 'historical', 'dramas', 'general', 'could',

204446,A30OXD42ZFYZLO,6300183998,Thomas Keneally,"[6, 6]","Charles Jarrott's movie has a superb cast and is beautifully photographed. It shows an extremely complex period of English history. Like the original play, the screenplay by John Hale and Bridget Boland, from an adaptation by Richard Sokolove, is the story of Henry's courtship of Anne (while he is still married to Katherine of Aragon), his break with Rome when he decides to divorce Katherine to marry Anne, and his final break with Anne when she cannot provide him with a male heir. Richard Burton as Henry and Genevieve Bujold as Anne have a battle of sexes and are a delight to watch. Miss Bujold, the French-Canadian actress, is a constantly delightful surprise as the young girl who first comes to respect Henry for the power she can wield, and then, just about the time he is growing tired of her, to love him. I say she's a surprise only because she has such a perfectly conventional beauty that her intelligence seems an unexpected dividend.It is sad that neither of them got an oscar despite sterling performances. The screenplay was also wonderful, though a lot of people may not approve of it. Everytime Henry meets Cardinal Wolsey, ""How are you, my Vicar of Hell?"" When Henry goes letching after Anne, old Wolsey is likely to wink and observe: ""Where the dove is, the hawk cannot be far behind."" Anthony Quayle does a good job as the cardinal.Henry, ""Anne, why do you taunt me so much.""Anne, ""Percy is married, your Grace. ""Henry, ""I had nothing to do with it.""Anne, ""So, Wolsey is King of England is it?""This enrages him so much that he drags her aside and says, ""I am the King of England.""Bujold had a few successes like Coma after this movie but this was one of her big successes. It is sad that very few people remember her and the oscar went to Maggie Smith. Though I enjoy her acting too, I do not remember that movie as I do this one. It is sad when an actor like Nicholas Cage gets an Oscar and one like Richard Burton gets disregarded so many times. People like Katherine Hepburn got 4 oscars, I frankly do not think that she deserved more than two of them, while people like Peter O'Toole got overlooked seven times. I wrote to Universal and asked them if they had plans to come out with a DVD of this, unfortunately they have nothing in the near future. They asked to keep checking their website.

204450,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6300183998,Westley,"[1, 1]","When King Henry VII (Richard Burton) spies the luscious Anne Boleyn (Genevieve Bujold) at court, he wants her.  He wants to make her his Queen, and he wants to discard his current wife, Katherine of Aragon (Irene Pappas), who has failed to produce a male heir.  So sets into motion the main plot of ""Anne of the Thousand Days,"" which encompasses some of the most fascinating of British history.""Anne of the Thousand Days"" has a reputation for being a bit ""fluffy"" when compared to some of the other costume dramas of the mid to late late 60s, such as ""A Man for All Season,"" ""Becket,"" and ""The Lion in Winter.""  Indeed, the film simply cannot stand up to those classics and has been criticized for some inaccuracies.  Instead, ""Anne"" plays better as high-class soap opera; based on these merits, the film is surprisingly good.  Richard Burton is adequate as Henry, although he plays the King as more cultured than have most other actors.  He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor - one of 10 nominations for the film (it won only for Costume Design); it was Burton's sixth unsuccessful Oscar nomination.  I do admire that he, for the most part, avoided hamminess.Whereas Burton is merely good, Bujold excels.  Her performance is so fully rounded; she manages to make Anne seem young, naive, and flirty in the beginning, and then she gradually brings forth the anger and despair of her later life.  That she does so without ever overplaying scenes is the power of her performance.  She was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, losing to Maggie Smith for ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.""  Bujold apparently was a somewhat difficult person with which to work, and she never managed to return to these heights again, despite some occasionally interesting roles such as ""Coma"" (1978) and ""Choose Me"" (1984).The script was based on the hit Broadway play from 1948.  Apparently, the themes of the play (e.g., the Queen's alleged incest) were too controversial at the time to be portrayed cinematically.  The script has some solid dialogue, especially Anne's soliloquy in the Tower of London and a scene when Anne shrewdly sets up the downfall of Cardinal Wolsey (Academy Award nominated Anthony Quayle).  The movie also shows the dramatic court intrigues that make this part of history so fascinating.  Characters quickly fall into and out of the King's favor and experience the requisite rewards and punishments accordingly.  The danger and precariousness of their positions are apparent.  The result is sometimes a bit melodramatic but entertaining.  If entertainment is all you're seeking in a costume drama, then ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" will probably fit that bill quite nicely.",4,"""And of those thousand, one when we were both in love.""",1242345600,"05 15, 2009",2009,2710,"['When', 'King', 'Henry', 'VII', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'luscious', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Genevieve', 'Bujold', 'court', 'make', 'Queen', 'discard', 'current', 'wife', 'Katherine', 'Aragon', 'Irene', 'Pappas', 'who', 'failed', 'produce', 'male', 'heir', 'motion', 'main', 'plot', 'Anne', 'Thousand', 'Days', 'most', 'fascinating', 'British', 'history', 'Anne', 'Thousand', 'Days', 'reputation', 'being', 'bit', 'fluffy', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'costume', 'dramas', 'mid', 'late', 'late', '60s', 'such', 'A', 'Man', 'Season', 'Becket', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'Indeed', 'film', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'classics', 'been', 'criticized', 'inaccuracies', 'Instead', 'Anne', 'better', 'high-class', 'soap', 'opera', 'based', 'merits', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'adequate', 'Henry', 'King', 'more', 'cultured', 'have', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', 'one', '10', 'nominations', 'film', 'won', 'only', 'Costume', 'Design', 'was', 'Burton', 'sixth', 'unsuccessful', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'do', 'admire', 'most', 'part', 'avoided', 'hamminess.Whereas', 'Burton', 'merely', 'good', 'Bujold', 'excels', 'performance', 'so', 'fully', 'rounded', 'make', 'Anne', 'seem', 'young', 'naive', 'flirty', 'beginning', 'then', 'gradually', 'forth', 'anger', 'despair', 'later', 'life', 'so', 'ever', 'overplaying', 'scenes', 'power', 'performance', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'losing', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Prime', 'Miss', 'Jean', 'Brodie', 'Bujold', 'apparently', 'was', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'person', 'work', 'never', 'managed', 'return', 'heights', 'again', 'occasionally', 'interesting', 'roles', 'such', 'Coma', '1978', 'Choose', 'Me', '1984', '.The', 'script', 'was', 'based', 'hit', 'Broadway', 'play', '1948', 'Apparently', 'themes', 'play', 'e.g.', 'Queen', 'alleged', 'incest', 'were', 'too', 'controversial', 'time', 'be', 'portrayed', 'cinematically', 'script', 'solid', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'Anne', 'soliloquy', 'Tower', 'London', 'scene', 'when', 'Anne', 'shrewdly', 'up', 'downfall', 'Cardinal', 'Wolsey', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'Anthony', 'Quayle', 'movie', 'also', 'dramatic', 'court', 'intrigues', 'make', 'part', 'history', 'fascinating', 'Characters', 'quickly', 'fall', 'King', 'favor', 'experience', 'requisite', 'rewards', 'punishments', 'accordingly', 'danger', 'precariousness', 'positions', 'are', 'apparent', 'result', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'entertaining', 'entertainment', ""'re"", 'seeking', 'costume', 'drama', 'then', 'Anne', 'Thousand', 'Days', 'will', 'probably', 'fit', 'bill', 'quite', 'nicely']",N/A
