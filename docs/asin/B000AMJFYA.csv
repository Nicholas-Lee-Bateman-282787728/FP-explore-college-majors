928669,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000AMJFYA,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 3]","It takes more to get into a movie, the older one gets, but Miranda July's 'Me and You and Everyone We Know' is uniquely absorbing.  The quiet vibrancy of all of her colorful characters have us all knowing all of them so well by the end of the movie, we feel tempted to call them up occasionally after the film's over to see how they're doing.It all begins once upon a time when everything falls apart for a father, a white man whose African-American wife is leaving him for anyone and anything better.  He's disconnected to his own sons, and their quiet suffering seems to be one of bewildered withdrawal, rather than heartbreak or anger.  The first scene shows him attempting a trick with lighter fluid.  It's a cheap stunt at getting their interest, but he, just like everything else in this comic-tragedy, fumbles and ends up severely burning his hands.  To top off the pathos, this man is a shoe salesman, for Pete' sake.  Pity is shown from the skies when another lovable loser, a freelance woman artist (July, herself), falls in love with him (played by John Hawkes, the same man who played the homely sailor in 'The Perfect Storm').  She tries to charm him and proves that she is perhaps more disfunctional, but also more imaginative than he.  She may end up saving them both.Then there's ""everyone we know,"" including two coming-of-age teenagers who want to experiment with sexuality.  Their approach seems so flippant that we sort out that it all comes down to their own desirability, more than desire.  They loosely become connected to the boys.  In contast, there's another, younger girl who is trapped in such a conventional setting, she can't help but resent the curious magic everyone else seems to have in the neighborhood.  The boys, like most young teenagers, look to others to define themselves when the parents are absent.  (And, as most of them know, there's nothing more absent than divorce, particularly at the beginning.)  The younger boy experiments on the Internet with only the approach that a pre-adolescent mind could grasp.  His curiosity could kill a cat, but his abandon grapples to understand the adult world.  Therefore, we have the adults and children seeking to be desirable and wanting to be defined by others.  The children easily bring innocence through their naivete'.  Similarly, the adults are lovable losers whose fresh, innocent approach to life is so endearing, we are prevented from bursting out into tears.And, here's where the objection comes in.  Perhaps because of her magnificent development, this reviewer worries too much.  Many critics deride the caveats on the film that this film depicts dangerous child sexuality (my paraphrase).  Nevertheless, while I scoff all protectionist interference, I want to put on every frame:  DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!  To their credit, they have me wanting to jump into the picture with my mini-tramp to flank every character, so they never get hurt.  But the whole point of the film is that the makers do all of that for us.  The characters are always skating on thin ice, but never falling in.  Movies can do that.  July and company suspend our belief so well, we can hardly think of events developing differently.  In real life people do fall in.  So what?  It's ludacris to think there is any dangerous enabling present, here.  The movie is a marvelous update of ""You Can't Take It with You"" with the originality that makes any comparisons an attempt to create familiar footing at the expense of being unfair.Anyway, this is a marvelous picture.  I believe my experience may not resonate with others.  You, dear reader, may watch this piece of cinema and scratch your head, and say, ""Who cares?"".  Respectfully, your reaction plausibly hits the whole gamit:  anger, indifference, incredulousness, hysterical laughter.  Few movies are able to elicit such a wide range of responses.  After over three months, this movie still haunts me.  I want to take all these people home with me and protect them from the dangers lurking and presented in the film.  This film is worth seeing because you may want to do the same.",4,"""Macaroni"" and Cheese",1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,4101,"['more', 'get', 'movie', 'older', 'one', 'Miranda', 'July', ""'Me"", 'Everyone', 'Know', 'uniquely', 'absorbing', 'quiet', 'vibrancy', 'colorful', 'characters', 'have', 'knowing', 'so', 'well', 'end', 'movie', 'feel', 'tempted', 'call', 'up', 'occasionally', 'film', 'see', 'how', ""'re"", 'doing.It', 'once', 'time', 'when', 'everything', 'apart', 'father', 'white', 'man', 'African-American', 'wife', 'leaving', 'anyone', 'anything', 'better', 'disconnected', 'own', 'sons', 'quiet', 'suffering', 'be', 'one', 'bewildered', 'withdrawal', 'rather', 'heartbreak', 'anger', 'first', 'scene', 'attempting', 'trick', 'lighter', 'fluid', 'cheap', 'stunt', 'getting', 'interest', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'comic-tragedy', 'fumbles', 'up', 'severely', 'burning', 'hands', 'top', 'off', 'pathos', 'man', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'Pete', 'sake', 'Pity', 'shown', 'skies', 'when', 'lovable', 'loser', 'freelance', 'woman', 'artist', 'July', 'love', 'played', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'homely', 'sailor', ""'The"", 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'charm', 'perhaps', 'more', 'disfunctional', 'also', 'more', 'imaginative', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'saving', 'both.Then', 'everyone', 'know', 'including', 'two', 'coming-of-age', 'teenagers', 'who', 'want', 'experiment', 'sexuality', 'approach', 'so', 'flippant', 'sort', 'out', 'down', 'own', 'desirability', 'more', 'desire', 'loosely', 'become', 'connected', 'boys', 'contast', 'younger', 'girl', 'who', 'trapped', 'such', 'conventional', 'setting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'resent', 'curious', 'magic', 'everyone', 'else', 'have', 'neighborhood', 'boys', 'most', 'young', 'teenagers', 'look', 'others', 'define', 'when', 'parents', 'are', 'absent', 'most', 'know', 'nothing', 'more', 'absent', 'divorce', 'particularly', 'beginning', 'younger', 'boy', 'experiments', 'Internet', 'only', 'approach', 'pre-adolescent', 'mind', 'could', 'grasp', 'curiosity', 'could', 'kill', 'cat', 'abandon', 'grapples', 'understand', 'adult', 'world', 'Therefore', 'have', 'adults', 'children', 'seeking', 'be', 'desirable', 'wanting', 'be', 'defined', 'others', 'children', 'easily', 'bring', 'innocence', 'naivete', 'Similarly', 'adults', 'are', 'lovable', 'losers', 'fresh', 'innocent', 'approach', 'life', 'so', 'endearing', 'are', 'prevented', 'bursting', 'out', 'tears.And', 'here', 'where', 'objection', 'Perhaps', 'magnificent', 'development', 'reviewer', 'too', 'much', 'Many', 'critics', 'deride', 'caveats', 'film', 'film', 'dangerous', 'child', 'sexuality', 'paraphrase', 'Nevertheless', 'scoff', 'protectionist', 'interference', 'want', 'put', 'frame', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'TRY', 'THIS', 'AT', 'HOME', 'credit', 'have', 'wanting', 'jump', 'picture', 'mini-tramp', 'flank', 'character', 'never', 'get', 'hurt', 'whole', 'point', 'film', 'makers', 'do', 'characters', 'are', 'always', 'skating', 'thin', 'ice', 'never', 'falling', 'Movies', 'can', 'do', 'July', 'company', 'suspend', 'belief', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'hardly', 'think', 'events', 'developing', 'differently', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'do', 'fall', 'what', 'ludacris', 'think', 'dangerous', 'enabling', 'present', 'here', 'movie', 'marvelous', 'update', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'originality', 'comparisons', 'attempt', 'create', 'familiar', 'footing', 'expense', 'being', 'unfair.Anyway', 'marvelous', 'picture', 'believe', 'experience', 'may', 'not', 'resonate', 'others', 'dear', 'reader', 'may', 'watch', 'piece', 'cinema', 'scratch', 'head', 'say', 'Who', 'Respectfully', 'reaction', 'plausibly', 'whole', 'gamit', 'anger', 'indifference', 'incredulousness', 'hysterical', 'laughter', 'Few', 'movies', 'are', 'able', 'elicit', 'wide', 'range', 'responses', 'three', 'months', 'movie', 'still', 'want', 'take', 'people', 'home', 'protect', 'dangers', 'lurking', 'presented', 'film', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'may', 'want', 'do', 'same']",N/A

928671,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000AMJFYA,A Customer,"[1, 3]","Suburban shoe salesman shoe salesman Richard (John Hawkes) is having a bad day. When he finds out that his wife is leaving him he reacts by setting his own hand on fire. Meanwhile, eccentric video artist Christine (Miranda July) makes ends meet as a taxi driver for the elderly whilst unsuccessfully trying to get her work exhibited in a cynical, unwelcoming art world.Accompanying one of her regular clients on a shoe-purchasing expedition, Christine begins a reluctant courtship with the emotionally burned Richard, who believes the right pair of shoes can change a person's life, but who hasn't quite figured out how to be a responsible father to his two young sons. Christine and Richard have obviously formed some kind of connection, but both are so dysfunctionally shy, that a substantial connection seems unlikely.Richard's 7-year-old Robby (Brandon Ratcliff) loves playing on his computer and enters into an Internet flirtation with a mysterious older woman, seducing her with his infantile obsession with poop. His 14-year-old Peter (Miles Thompson) finds himself on the receiving end of a challenge between two precocious girls (Natasha Slayton, Najarra Townsend) who wish to know which one of them gives better oral satisfaction.And lets not forget the 12-year-old neighbor girl (Carlie Westerman) obsessed with acquiring first-class consumer items for her hope chest. She likes to parade her purchases for all to see, especially for Peter with whom she has a bit of a crush on.Peppered with bizarre characters and oddball scenarios, You and Me and Everyone I Know is like nothing you've ever seen before. Written and Directed by the talented Miranda July, the film cleverly skewers the world of installation art, weaving elements of the romantic comedy into story that is really about the need to connect in the modern world.All these very different stories magically interlock and play out in a style that is quirky and unpredictable. In this film everyone is searching, where children long to become adults, adults yearn to recapture the innocence of youth, and everyone has difficulty finding true love at age 7 or 70. For a lot of viewers it may take a while to fully rise to July's wavelength and comprehend her offbeat sense of humour. But July stages and edits her work as if in time to an inner beat, ticking away in unpredictable fits and starts, so it's almost impossible not the get caught up in the film's sustained whimsy.But it is July herself that anchors this film. She's such an appealing leading lady and a totally winning screen presence with her mop of curly hair and her wide inquisitive eyes. Obviously eccentric but also quite sensitive, the actress is totally in tune to the celestial coincidences that unite her characters, able to capture those small and indefinable moments of human experience.

The opening sequence gives an impression of the artistic temperament shared by all those who hate/do not understand art. But, by the time the movie is through, it is likely you will not only be won over but also biting your lip.This movie is absolutely exquisite, relying exclusively on a great script, great acting, and marvelously eccentric characters. Ten year-old Sylvie who is methodically building her hope chest is just too good, and the performances by Richard's two sons are stellar. It would be unjust to overlook the splendid music, which, in combination with the pacing, creates the fragile texture of a dream.Nothing here withstands much analytical scrutiny, just as setting your hand on fire is probably not the best way to save a crumbling marriage - much less convince your watching children of your exemplary parenting skills.  No matter.What it does get 100% right is the feeling of longing for a kindred soul, the need to connect, and the monstrous barriers that stand in the way.

The characters are the kind of people you meet on the street that don't seem to have anything all that special about them until you get to know them a little more and realize there is something special hidden in them.The film was written, directed by and starred Miranda July.My complaint with the movie is the film's indulgences.  Whether it is the purposefully stilted dialogue, the ""everybody hurts"" reminders (see r.e.m.) or the sometimes inappropriate sexuality that was meant as exposure to some truth of what is happening out there; it seemed unnecessary and exactly what an artist would do to drive home the point.It's reasonable to notice that much of what is considered modern art today has much in common in feel and approach: an alienated/alienating, self-consumed expression of everything wrong with the world and themselves.The measurement of creativity is in the variations it gives to a theme, not how weird one can make it.  Yes, weird can be a variant; but often enough weird is the most obvious variant because it is the inversion of what is considered normalcy.  (i.e. the artist is trying too hard to get people to notice them.)Me and You and Everyone We Know has it's values and I cannot discredit what is good about the film.

Instead, I found it to be incredibly empty and unsatisfying....not to mention slightly disturbing and utterly depressing.  I expected something akin to ""Little Miss Sunshine"" but it was more like ""Happiness"".  I loved the former and hated the latter.  So you know how I feel about this one.I'm pretty sure the filmmaker (Miranda July) is trying to say something here.  What that something is, I have no idea.  Society is messed up?  I already know that, I don't need to be browbeaten over 90 minutes to ""get"" that.  Is the filmmaker making fun of these nuts, or is she trying to make them sympathetic?  I hope she's making fun of them, but I'm not so sure that she was.  Maybe we're supposed to feel sorry for them and laugh at them at the same time?  I think she was trying to make some homage to the randomness of life and human connections, but she failed miserably if that was her intent, as there are many films which do that infinitely better.  In all honesty, I have no clue what I am supposed to take from this movie.  One thing I definitely took: I cannot envision any scenario in which I would want to watch it again.My friend whom I watched it with loved it, and you can see all the good reviews.  So I'm obviously in the minority on this one.  And that's okay.  (I asked my friend to explain what she liked about the film.  Her response?  ""I'm easily entertained."") I found it to be an absolute trainwreck from start to finish.  I can think of one scene throughout the entire film that I sincerely enjoyed watching.And then there are the characters, whom you would think in a film titled ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" would be people that are instantly familiar to everyone.  It must have been Miranda's contrived attempt at irony, as I couldn't relate to any of these characters and sincerely hope I never, ever meet anyone like them.  ""Me and You and Everyone We Know?""  Not quite.  How about: ""Everyone You Don't Know and Hope You Never Meet?""  That would have been a more apt title, because if you can relate to any of these characters, it might be time to get some professional help.  I can't think of one main character that couldn't be described as completely neurotic.  That, and I just couldn't get past the borderline kiddie porn.... just couldn't do it.  I'm no right wing Christian conservative either, far from it, but it was over the line for me.Overall, it was a very depressing and uncomfortable movie to watch.  And this is supposed to be a comedy?  Then how come I laughed out loud maybe two or three times throughout the entire film?  I think I'll go watch ""Little Miss Sunshine"" again.  I need something pleasant to wash out the awful taste this movie left me with.  Most definitely a ""love it or hate it"" experience, and you know which camp I'm in.

On the one hand wonderful movies should be acclaimed but sometimes, more often then not, they are overlooked or misunderstood. A movie like this could easily be misunderstood and grouped-in with a movie like Happiness, which was highly objectionable. This movie should be viewed in a completely different light, even though it touches on some of the same controversial themes as does Happiness, Kids, Ripe and Thirteen. Also, this is much like a lot of other movies famous for mixed reviews like Elephant, Slackers or Titus.I once saw a teriffic short on IFC or Sundance about an adolescent girl named Jo seemingly giving rise to her sexuality that seems to be leaning toward lesbianism. The treatment was surprisingly natural and charming. Even with pointed remarks from some of the other girls, the film still remained accepting and gave a matter of fact feeling. It took a woman to make that short. Only a woman can take the chance of making a film like that short or Me and You and Everyone We Know. Men generally resort to overtness for fear of being taken too seriously.(I'm not overt to making a new word to get it said.)Thank goodness Miranda July is a woman so she could take the chance and make this quite simply, great film. It's a film about budding sexuality, refinding one's sexuality and accepting life's condition. It's exceptionally arty much in the style of Van Sant's Elephant. It's structure is reminiscent of Altman's Nashville or Short Cuts. It basically very quiet and introspective like The Clearing. If you hated those or find these subjects inherently objectionable, then you might steer clear. But if you don't and you're looking for something enlightening that is witty, clever, exceedingly well acted, conceived and excuted then you should love this excellent movie.Its wonderful ending, lifted from an indie from the late fifties, could be a topic of discussion for hours.Forever",5,Do whatever you normally do,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,1980,"[""'m"", 'rather', 'surprised', 'acclaim', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'received', 'one', 'hand', 'wonderful', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'acclaimed', 'sometimes', 'more', 'often', 'then', 'not', 'are', 'overlooked', 'misunderstood', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'misunderstood', 'grouped-in', 'movie', 'Happiness', 'was', 'highly', 'objectionable', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'completely', 'different', 'light', 'even', 'same', 'controversial', 'themes', 'Happiness', 'Kids', 'Ripe', 'Thirteen', 'Also', 'much', 'lot', 'other', 'movies', 'famous', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'Elephant', 'Slackers', 'Titus.I', 'once', 'saw', 'teriffic', 'short', 'IFC', 'Sundance', 'adolescent', 'girl', 'named', 'Jo', 'seemingly', 'giving', 'rise', 'sexuality', 'be', 'leaning', 'lesbianism', 'treatment', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'natural', 'charming', 'Even', 'pointed', 'remarks', 'other', 'girls', 'film', 'still', 'remained', 'accepting', 'gave', 'matter', 'fact', 'feeling', 'took', 'woman', 'make', 'short', 'Only', 'woman', 'can', 'take', 'chance', 'making', 'film', 'short', 'Me', 'Everyone', 'Know', 'Men', 'generally', 'resort', 'overtness', 'fear', 'being', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', ""'m"", 'not', 'overt', 'making', 'new', 'word', 'get', 'said', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Miranda', 'July', 'woman', 'could', 'take', 'chance', 'make', 'quite', 'simply', 'great', 'film', 'film', 'budding', 'sexuality', 'refinding', 'one', 'sexuality', 'accepting', 'life', 'condition', 'exceptionally', 'arty', 'much', 'style', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Elephant', 'structure', 'reminiscent', 'Altman', 'Nashville', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'basically', 'very', 'quiet', 'introspective', 'Clearing', 'hated', 'find', 'subjects', 'inherently', 'objectionable', 'then', 'might', 'steer', 'clear', 'do', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'enlightening', 'witty', 'clever', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'acted', 'conceived', 'excuted', 'then', 'should', 'love', 'excellent', 'movie.Its', 'wonderful', 'ending', 'lifted', 'indie', 'late', 'fifties', 'could', 'be', 'topic', 'discussion', 'hours.Forever']",N/A

She wants to say something profound and create something magical. Sorry, but sometimes you need a bit more experience in life to stop navel gazing and learn that narrative has to have pace. People mainly go to the movies to escape and also see people onscreen they either can relate to or can sit and gawk at for their looks. If this works for you, fine, but you still need to reach beyond the audience who will sit through stuff like this to actually make yourself heard beyond your circle of enablers.It's an art fillum, folks, and it isn't Truffaut.

She laughed at scenes that would sicken some, and laughed at scenes that were not terribly funny.  She spent a great deal of time ""getting the joke.""  In all honesty this film went over my head.  Not because it was confusing but because it wasn't very interesting and, at its heart, was a movie that was pretty shallow.ME, YOU AND EVERYONE WE KNOW tells the story of a group of people.  Their all connected by some small threads or small rather large.  One guy works in the same shoe store with another guy, one women runs an art gallery and another women wants to get her art shown, the guy who works at the shoe store has a teenage son who is connected to two teenage girls ""orally""  who are being seduced by an older man with sexually suggestive signs, that man is the other man who works at the shoe store, and the women who wants to get her art shown is falling for the first man at the shoe store, who has a young son (probably 6 or 7) who is having a sexual discussion with an adult women in a chat room, who may or may not be someone I mentioned above. Wow, kind of a mouthful don't you think??I could use theses characters names, I could give you some plot points.  But at the end of the film they're really not important.  Because as much as the movie wants to connect you to the characters, they are all merely plot devices. In the film that is all a bunch of platitudes and pretty pictures.  There is no depth to the characters on screen, no passion, no good or bad humor.  They are simply characters with quirks that move on the whims and fancy of screenplay.  They're designed not to be people but plot devices.Most superficial romantic comedies at least offer characters that can be nice to watch.  But in July's world these people have to have some kind of depth.  But not real depth, instead the film has to flirt with pedophilia and then has to wax poetic about what art is, and has to build mystery that don't lead us any closer to any real truth, or any real questions.  Instead it asks you to talk about the film with others and you can sit around drinking herbal teas and talk about ""THE EXISTENTIAL CRISIS"" or the ""ARTIST MERIT"" of the piece.  That's not a bad thing.But after talking about those things for a little while, you may just find that there is nothing there.  Just a couple of pretty pictures, and a little kid holding a quarter ""just passing time.""Director Miranda July frames the picture very well.  The only thing I can really complement her on is that she is a competent director with the potential to make some very good movies.  Her cast is quite good especially the children, who are believable.  She does some pretty nice things with the camera, she captures energy and power, and even makes a couple of the ""gags"" work.  But in the end it's all for nothing, because she forgot that beyond making the film look good, we need to feel for these characters, and unfortunately I did not.  Other can feel differently, but I can't see how.Art has its place in film.  But film has powers that are way above pretty pictures, and deep thoughts.  Talking about film and why it moves you also has it's place.  But ME, YOU, AND EVERYONE WE KNOW fails because it talks big and at the end has nothing to show for it but shallow platitudes and explicit content designed to only shock, and not to bring the audience anywhere near true understanding.",2,An Empty Art Film,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,4240,"['What', 'one', 'think', 'when', 'think', 'art', 'Art', 'can', 'be', 'captivating', 'beautiful', 'passionate', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'empty', 'even', 'vapid', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'adjectives', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'amount', 'material', 'material', 'Art', 'can', 'exist', 'mind', 'can', 'be', 'idea', 'spark', 'genius', 'One', 'man', 'Picasso', 'man', 'ashtray', 'One', 'man', 'crucifix', 'jar', 'urine', 'puts', 'pieces', 'glass', 'together', 'window', 'church', 'Art', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'nailed', 'down', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'worse', ""'re"", 'indifferent', 'too', 'it.Miranda', 'July', 'ME', 'YOU', 'EVERYONE', 'WE', 'KNOW', 'as', 'close', 'art', 'film', 'think', 'ever', 'will', 'willingly', 'want', 'go', 'kind', 'film', 'there', 'demands', 'spoken', 'about', 'over', 'fact', 'women', 'theater', 'raved', 'how', 'existential', 'was', 'laughed', 'scenes', 'would', 'sicken', 'laughed', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'terribly', 'funny', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'getting', 'joke', 'honesty', 'film', 'went', 'head', 'Not', 'was', 'confusing', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'heart', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'shallow.ME', 'YOU', 'EVERYONE', 'WE', 'KNOW', 'story', 'group', 'people', 'connected', 'small', 'threads', 'small', 'rather', 'large', 'One', 'guy', 'same', 'shoe', 'store', 'guy', 'one', 'women', 'art', 'gallery', 'women', 'get', 'art', 'shown', 'guy', 'who', 'shoe', 'store', 'teenage', 'son', 'who', 'connected', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'orally', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'seduced', 'older', 'man', 'sexually', 'suggestive', 'signs', 'man', 'other', 'man', 'who', 'shoe', 'store', 'women', 'who', 'get', 'art', 'shown', 'falling', 'first', 'man', 'shoe', 'store', 'who', 'young', 'son', 'probably', '6', '7', 'who', 'having', 'sexual', 'discussion', 'adult', 'women', 'chat', 'room', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'above', 'Wow', 'kind', 'mouthful', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'use', 'theses', 'characters', 'names', 'could', 'give', 'plot', 'points', 'end', 'film', ""'re"", 'really', 'not', 'important', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'connect', 'characters', 'are', 'merely', 'plot', 'devices', 'film', 'bunch', 'platitudes', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'depth', 'characters', 'screen', 'passion', 'good', 'bad', 'humor', 'are', 'simply', 'characters', 'quirks', 'move', 'whims', 'fancy', 'screenplay', ""'re"", 'designed', 'not', 'be', 'people', 'plot', 'devices.Most', 'superficial', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'least', 'offer', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'nice', 'watch', 'July', 'world', 'people', 'have', 'have', 'kind', 'depth', 'not', 'real', 'depth', 'instead', 'film', 'flirt', 'pedophilia', 'then', 'wax', 'poetic', 'what', 'art', 'build', 'mystery', 'do', ""n't"", 'lead', 'closer', 'real', 'truth', 'real', 'questions', 'Instead', 'talk', 'film', 'others', 'can', 'sit', 'around', 'drinking', 'herbal', 'teas', 'talk', 'THE', 'EXISTENTIAL', 'CRISIS', 'ARTIST', 'MERIT', 'piece', 'not', 'bad', 'thing.But', 'talking', 'things', 'little', 'while', 'may', 'just', 'find', 'nothing', 'there', 'Just', 'couple', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'little', 'kid', 'holding', 'quarter', 'just', 'passing', 'time', 'Director', 'Miranda', 'July', 'picture', 'very', 'well', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'really', 'complement', 'competent', 'director', 'potential', 'make', 'very', 'good', 'movies', 'cast', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'believable', 'pretty', 'nice', 'things', 'camera', 'energy', 'power', 'even', 'couple', 'gags', 'work', 'end', 'nothing', 'forgot', 'making', 'film', 'look', 'good', 'need', 'feel', 'characters', 'unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'Other', 'can', 'feel', 'differently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how.Art', 'place', 'film', 'film', 'powers', 'are', 'way', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'deep', 'thoughts', 'Talking', 'film', 'why', 'also', 'place', 'ME', 'YOU', 'AND', 'EVERYONE', 'WE', 'KNOW', 'big', 'end', 'nothing', 'show', 'shallow', 'platitudes', 'explicit', 'content', 'designed', 'only', 'shock', 'not', 'bring', 'audience', 'anywhere', 'true', 'understanding']",N/A

This writing/directorial debut is full of characters who seem startlingly realistic, but in a way that makes the world seem just a little kinder than it was before.Christine (July) is a shy performance artist who works as an senior-cab driver. Richard (John Hawkes) is a lonely shoe salesman who has just been dumped by his wife, and is bewildered by his loneliness. His younger son is having a cyberaffair with a fortysomething woman, and his elder son is getting a bit too close with the local girls.A chance encounter in a store, and on the street, brings Richard and Christine together for a few minutes, and convinces Christine that they may have a future together. The two dance awkwardly around each other -- Christine wants to be with Richard, but Richard's divorce wounds are still too fresh. Will these awkward soulmates connect at last?Early in the movie, Richard announces that, ""I want to be swept off my feet, you know? I am prepared for amazing things to happen. I can handle it!"" Well, he gets an amazing thing: Christine. ""Me and You..."" doesn't have Hollywood-pretty actors having Big Dramatic Moments. Instead, the beauty of this quirky love story is that it could happen to any of us -- a chance encounter bringing us together with a true soulmate.The simple plot moves with surprising speed, as the characters learn to pursue their happiness. July fills it with delicate, moving scenes, such as a scene where Christine and her friend Michael try to save a goldfish on a moving car. When the bag falls, your heart will break.But ""Me and You..."" is also incredibly funny. The movie is full of cheerful seniors, funny art videos, and even a little girl who is stocking up appliances and towels so she can be a good housewife. The cyberaffair and teen sex play would seem creepy in most movies, but to July's credit, she manages to make it seem strangely innocent.And as Christine, July is a lovable character. She has boundless love, energy and friendship, but until she meets Richard, she has no one to give it to. Hawkes gives an excellent performance opposite her. He seems kind of weird at first, until we realize that Richard is still in shock from the divorce.""Me and You And Everyone We Know"" was one of the most beautiful, heartfelt movies to come out in 2005, and will leave you with a feeling that the world might be kind after all.

Miranda July's film has all the awkwardness and eccentricity (maybe even more eccentricity) but very little black humor, instead it tries (too hard) to constantly keep up a ""isn't life mysteriously wonderful and wonderfully mysterious?"" childlike vibe throughout.Just about every single character is an awkward yet tragically, deeply sensitive soul underneath their thick surfaces of outward strangeness.I didn't know anything about this movie going in, but immediately guessed correctly that Miranda July was the writer/director, based on the character she plays in the movie.

928695,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000AMJFYA,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 3]","""Quirky"" doesn't begin to describe this alternately capricious and thoughtful look at the intersection of lonely souls in this low-budget 2005 film. Directed and written by performance artist and first-time filmmaker Miranda July, it has been reaping a bevy of awards and even made Entertainment Weekly's Top 10 film list for 2005. At the same time, it is an acquired taste with some offbeat moments of true originality and a pervasive banality that can get frustrating over the course of its ninety-minute running time. In her idiosyncratic way, July seems to be trying for the sensibilities of a film like Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"", but she doesn't really get beyond the abject loneliness of her characters.The plot plays out in a string of odd episodes focusing on Christine, an aspiring performance artist moonlighting as an ""Eldercab"" driver (i.e., driving senior citizens around), and Richard, a shoe salesman and father of two reeling over his wife's decision to leave him. Based on a randomly insightful comment Richard makes to Christine in selling her some pink shoes, she boldly attempts to initiate a relationship, but this is only one of several plots strands that the film covers. The others involve Christine's persistent plea to have her work accepted by the curator of the local contemporary art museum, Richard's struggles in being a single parent, the pathetic obsession that Richard's co-worker Andrew has for two pubescent girls, the sexually deviant chatting that Richard's sons conduct with a grown woman online and a young girl's precocious need to organize her dowry. There are scenes so eccentric that they actually work, for example, the oddly elliptical conversation Christine and Richard have as they stroll to the end of the block or the scene with the goldfish hanging onto life on the hoods of moving cars. However, the tone gets wearing as the film's episodic nature doesn't lead to any resounding conclusion or satisfying epiphany.July herself plays Christine amateurishly though with a realistic awkwardness as I imagine her fictitious and factual selves are interchangeable. As Richard, John Hawkes brings a palpable desperation to his role that is probably the most realistic aspect to the film. The rest of the cast feels like indie-film regulars, though six-year old Brandon Ratcliff steals his scenes with his plaintive manner and nonchalance in developing an Internet relationship with an older woman. In fact, his scene in the park near the end achieves an ironic poignancy that the rest of the film sadly doesn't accomplish. The irritating carousel music that serves as the score is by Mike Andrews. The DVD's only worthwhile extras are six deleted scenes, all as eccentric as the film itself. You can certainly sense July's aspiration to achieve something transcendent here, but bottom line, this film is definitely not for everyone.",3,"Lonely Souls Intertwine in a Sometimes Insightful, Often Frustrating and Always Eccentric Film",1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,2885,"['Quirky', ""n't"", 'begin', 'describe', 'alternately', 'capricious', 'thoughtful', 'look', 'intersection', 'lonely', 'souls', 'low-budget', '2005', 'film', 'Directed', 'written', 'performance', 'artist', 'first-time', 'filmmaker', 'Miranda', 'July', 'been', 'reaping', 'bevy', 'awards', 'even', 'made', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'Top', '10', 'film', 'list', '2005', 'same', 'time', 'acquired', 'taste', 'offbeat', 'moments', 'true', 'originality', 'pervasive', 'banality', 'can', 'get', 'frustrating', 'course', 'ninety-minute', 'running', 'time', 'idiosyncratic', 'way', 'July', 'be', 'trying', 'sensibilities', 'film', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'Magnolia', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'abject', 'loneliness', 'characters.The', 'plot', 'out', 'string', 'odd', 'episodes', 'focusing', 'Christine', 'aspiring', 'performance', 'artist', 'moonlighting', 'Eldercab', 'driver', 'i.e.', 'driving', 'senior', 'citizens', 'Richard', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'father', 'two', 'reeling', 'wife', 'decision', 'leave', 'Based', 'randomly', 'insightful', 'comment', 'Richard', 'Christine', 'selling', 'pink', 'shoes', 'boldly', 'initiate', 'relationship', 'only', 'one', 'several', 'plots', 'strands', 'film', 'others', 'involve', 'Christine', 'persistent', 'plea', 'have', 'work', 'accepted', 'curator', 'local', 'contemporary', 'art', 'museum', 'Richard', 'struggles', 'being', 'single', 'parent', 'pathetic', 'obsession', 'Richard', 'co-worker', 'Andrew', 'two', 'pubescent', 'girls', 'sexually', 'deviant', 'chatting', 'Richard', 'sons', 'conduct', 'grown', 'woman', 'online', 'young', 'girl', 'precocious', 'need', 'organize', 'dowry', 'are', 'scenes', 'so', 'eccentric', 'actually', 'work', 'example', 'oddly', 'elliptical', 'conversation', 'Christine', 'Richard', 'have', 'stroll', 'end', 'block', 'scene', 'goldfish', 'hanging', 'life', 'hoods', 'moving', 'cars', 'However', 'tone', 'wearing', 'film', 'episodic', 'nature', ""n't"", 'lead', 'resounding', 'conclusion', 'satisfying', 'epiphany.July', 'Christine', 'amateurishly', 'realistic', 'awkwardness', 'imagine', 'fictitious', 'factual', 'selves', 'are', 'interchangeable', 'Richard', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'palpable', 'desperation', 'role', 'probably', 'most', 'realistic', 'aspect', 'film', 'rest', 'cast', 'feels', 'indie-film', 'regulars', 'six-year', 'old', 'Brandon', 'Ratcliff', 'scenes', 'plaintive', 'manner', 'nonchalance', 'developing', 'Internet', 'relationship', 'older', 'woman', 'fact', 'scene', 'park', 'end', 'ironic', 'poignancy', 'rest', 'film', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'accomplish', 'irritating', 'carousel', 'music', 'score', 'Mike', 'Andrews', 'DVD', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'extras', 'are', 'six', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'as', 'eccentric', 'film', 'can', 'certainly', 'sense', 'July', 'aspiration', 'achieve', 'something', 'transcendent', 'here', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone']",N/A

It takes awhile, maybe twenty minutes to enter the world in which this movie is taking place.  But once you do, you will find your heart opening up to numerous characters that you are desperately rooting for.  It is a fable populated with people who want nothing more than the little pleasures of life.  There are a few perverse moments reminding one that people are truly strange, silly, awkward, lonely.

This so-called movie is an absolutely uncomfortable, horrid, ill-conceived, misguided, and disturbing mess.  I've seen probably hundreds of movies in my lifetime, and this one now has the distinction of being the absolute worst, the bottom of the barrel (and that includes Hollywood dreck like Linda Blair's ""Roller Boogie,"" which has just climbed a notch to allow room for this one to make the bottom of the list).  Its irresponsible portrayal of adult themes actually upset me.  The cast does their best, especially John Hawkes, though he should still seriously think about firing his agent, and writer/director Miranda July, but maybe she should just stick to acting (going forward, I will remember to steer clear of anything associated with her name as a writer/director), but their satisfactory performances are cancelled out by an awkward, insipid, icky-feeling, are-you-kidding-me, 92-minutes-seems-like-forever mess.  I now know that I cannot truly trust even the top movie critics' opinions.  I wonder if these critics can actually sit down and comfortably watch this movie with their spouses, friends, or immediate family members, including their children, while eating popcorn, and my opinion may or may not have been influenced by the fact that I saw this movie right after a wholesome Hallmark movie, but I don't think so.  If you like simulated self-mutilation and extremely unpleasant pedophilic and predatory undertones (whether or not that's an artsy real-world reality), and the subsequent lingering anxiety and maybe even depression that comes from watching a film that includes those things, this movie's for you, but you may want to consider changing your name.  Unfortunately, I now have to live with the stigma of having watched this film all the way through (because I wanted my review to qualify as fair), including that creepy ending, and, interestingly, afterwards, besides feeling somewhat physically ill, I felt like I needed to lift my spirits and revive my confidence in great movie-making by watching one of Hollywood's genuinely great classics or a life-affirming, feel-good film that actually has substance, which was completely absent in this film.  I feel like I was deceived by the top critics' opinions and colorful little bubbles on the DVD case (as if this was a cheery family movie) and regretfully made the mistake of purchasing the DVD (also because it was inexpensive), and my only positive feeling associated with the movie was when I broke the disk in two and threw it in the garbage, where it belongs.

928698,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000AMJFYA,Grady Harp,"[4, 6]","In a year of a true mixed bag of films and now that the year has officially passed, ME AND YOU AND EVERYONE WE KNOW remains  one of the most refreshing features of 2005.  Written, directed, and starring one Miranda July (a performance artist), this truly unique film has many firsts in its message, its manner of storytelling, its vision, its honesty, and its perception of life as we are currently living it. It is a little gem.There are about five stories delicately laced together in this examination of a spectrum of emotionally isolated people and their attempts to connect to each other.  Miranda intentionally keeps these remarkable stories separate (reflecting her concept that we have arrived at a state where we all are sadly alone longing to belong), and yet each of the characters knows each other - by proximity of living space, working space, street corners, chatrooms, and bus benches.Richard Swersey (John Hawkes in a deeply multidimensional performance) has recently lost his African American wife because she was bored, leaving Richard and their two sons, 14-year-old Peter (Miles Thompson) and 7-year-old Robby (Brandon Ratcliff)  to move to a new apartment.  Richard, desperate for attention has set fire to his hand, trying to impress his boys and deflect the pain of losing his wife.  He is a simple shoe salesman and ties to make a happy world for his boys. Christine (Miranda July), a video artist with strange techniques makes her living driving Eldercab, taking old people shopping.  On one of these excursions she encounters Richard at his shoe store, is smitten by him, longs to be attractive to men in general and Richard in particular and goes at great lengths to ""connect"" to the reluctant Richard.Peter and Robby get to know their neighbors: Rebecca (Najarra Townsend) and Heather (Natasha Slayton) are under 18 with foaming hormones who flirt with Richard's co-worker Andrew (Brad William Henke) which drives him to leave porno notes to them on his Venetian blinds,  and who eventually introduce Peter to a game of 'differential diagnosis of fellatio'; Sylvie (Carlie Westerman) who occupies her lonely life by preparing her hope chest for her ideal marriage of the future. They entertain themselves by entering chatrooms, a diversion Robby quickly masters and lines up an online date through his hilarious ideas of seduction!Christine devotes her own time to making her art and in attempting to get noticed she approaches a gallerist who can't be bothered but who re-enters the story further in the film in a way that demonstrates that she is not the cold, self-sufficient woman she appears to be.There are far too many moments of exquisitely detailed glimpses of how each of these wonderful characters become momentarily tangent then bounce away like random atoms in orbit to quickly to  even begin to relate.  But that is the joy of this film.  Miranda July plucks little gems from the air, disperses them throughout the film, leaves most hanging because that is the way we are living, and yet leaves us feeling that the vision of an untainted tabula rasa child's stance is beautifully fresh.  Each member of this very strong cast gives performances of complete pleasure: July knows her vision and describes it well.  Highly Recommended for those who long for fresh and stunning independent films.

There are characters of all ages.Basic storyline -there is a contemporary artist with little or no life, there is a father who's two sons won't talk to him and his wife doesn't care cause she's left him, there is a small sound of a metal striking a metal, two teenage girls who're virgins and another man...plus two elders,a little girl who's a neighbour and lives with her mom----All of them are trying to make it through their life by doing whatever somewhat pleases them.At no point in the film are these people in extreme happiness or discontent.

Deferbrache,"[8, 16]","After reading the other negative reviews on this sight, I would like to say that the problem here is not that the movie skirts on ""child pornography,"" because it does not. In fact, the younger children are the most insightful (and I might add intelligent) characters in the entire movie. The problem is that this movie knows nothing about the way people truly interact with each other on a personal and romantic level. Instead it is a mindless interchange of airheaded dialogue which the director believes is insightful and moving. The two main characters, played by Miranda July and John Hawkes, are like five-year-olds trapped in thirty-five-year-old bodies. July is an ""artist"" who passes her time filming herself doing things that in real life would make people think she was a mentally challenged drug addict, but which this movie believes makes her eccentric, interesting and lovable. Hawkes is a careless shoe store salesman who allows his six-year-old son to walk home alone and severly burns his hand with lighter fluid, believing it will burn on him harmlessly like alcohol. Are we to believe that anyone of a sound mind would actually make this mistake? These two are a good match because they spend much of their time in starry eyed wonder of the world around them and exchange dopey philosophical speculations with strangers. The dialogue between these two is amateur and fake at best and the movie knows absolutely nothing about adult relationships. July might have done better to make these two characters children as well, that way they could be given some sort of credibility for their ridiculous actions. Other characters in the movie are somewhat worthwhile and interesting, but these two are so immature and annoying that they necessarily drag everything else down with them.

A major thrill for the audience was an Internet chat-room sequence in which a 7 year old boy, Robby (Brandon Ratcliff), who seems clinically regressed, shares his fantasy children writing about 'poop' on the Internet were amusing, offbeat, almost Todd Solondz-like scenes. This dear notion of sexual union makes the woman hot, she types back. July's legions just loved this sequence. And it does undeniably qualify as an original vision. But that was it. I didn't laugh again and slowly got bored.Miss July casts herself in a major role here as Christine, a dreamy wisp of a woman seeking recognition as an arty photographer who spins narratives to surround her shots. Meanwhile, she ministers to aging folks, working as an ""Elder Taxi"" driver and companion. She also takes a strong liking to a struggling shoe salesman, Richard, played by John Hawkes, whose looks are such that he would be perfectly cast as Zonker Harris, if a live action feature of Doonesbury is ever made. To me Miss July was just irritating and self-absorbed and every scene involving her made me feel that this film was trying to be quirky for the sake of being quirky. This is not to say that the filmmaker lacks talent.Hawkes plays the one substantial, coherent, sympathetic, if overly stressed, character in this film. Newly separated from Pam (Jonell Kennedy), he shares with her the parenting of the couple's two kids, Robby and 14 year old Peter (Miles Thompson), and perpetually looks harried as he dashes between his family and the mall where he works. Ratcliff and Thompson were okay in their roles, but they had so little to do by the end that they were wasted.The photography, editing and scene arrangements are adequate. But, beyond the difficult circumstances for Richard and his sons, there's little to care about in this film.

928706,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000AMJFYA,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","One of the best films of 2005, ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" is the directorial debut of writer/director/star Miranda July. The movie is offbeat, humorous, odd, and even at times beautiful. It's got a perfect mood to it that bares resemblance to the work of Alexander Payne, but is also a work of complete originality. The movie has a wonderful script, great acting, great cinematography, and some very different dialouge. By that, I mean that July doesn't just use dialogue as a means of leading up to a scene in a film or passing the time. The dialogue is also used to make statements and share personal opinions. The movie stars John Hawkes (Deadwood, From Dusk Till Dawn) as Richard Swersey, a shoe salesmen who has just separated from his wife and spends his time working or raising his two boys Peter and Robby, who are mostly on a computer in chat rooms. Writer/Director July plays Christine, an artist (who's art is quite weird) who also owns a cab service called Elder Cab which she drives old people around in. Christine is a weird character, zany and offbeat who meets Richard, who is not really impressed. Meanwhile, two teenage girls meet an older man who sends them messages from his window (which ends up inspiring a few really funny scenes). The movie is really unique and wonderful, it's really different from any movies you'd see and to top that all off...It's her first film. Not to mention, (not be sexist or anything) this is a movie written by a woman. Woman rarely create movies like this. It's hard for me to explain just how good this movie is in mere words, so I guess you should just see it for yourself. As for the ""Disturbing Sexual Content Involving Children"" which is listed as one of the reasons for the 'R' rating. That particular content is hardly disturbing, except for the scene on the bench which is oddly beautiful. My only complaint (even though it is kind of important) is the ""back and forth"" scenes, which are kind of sick and weird...How do people think up ideas like this? Anyway, really...Don't let this movie slip away.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 11]","Self-consciously ""arty"" at every turn, it's easy to see why many people love ""Me and You and Everyone We Know""--but it's just as easy for me to see why people also loathe this film.  Performance artist Miranda July has fashioned a piece about urban disconnect and lost souls and has populated it with quirky characters and outlandish situations.  And while many compare the tone of the film to a Todd Solondz picture, to me it doesn't have quite the same brash in-your-face entertainment style.  July's piece is quieter and more contemplative.""Quirky"" has become the new curse on the indie film scene.  There are an abundance of films that work with outlandish character types--we're supposed to be instantly charmed.  But for all the films that utilize this formula, few are really successful (for me, two diverse examples would be Solondz's ""Happiness"" or even ""Junebug"").  And while July doesn't quite reach those heights, there is still plenty to be admired in her first effort.One very smart choice is that everything is underplayed!  The situations aren't particularly believable, but the feelings elicited from them have a truth and sweetness.  I used the phrase ""finding the realness in unreality"" in another review, and I think it's apt here too.  While I didn't believe many of the plot points were realistic, there was still a thoughtfulness and heart behind them--and I think there are parts of the film that will stay with you.The actors are uniformly good.  Again, the success of the film rests on it's subtlety.  Most of the performances were understated, it was as if life were just unfolding around these characters.  Had any of this been played broadly, it would have been disastrous.  For those concerned about the elements some label as ""child pornography or exploitation,"" serious minded viewers have nothing to get worked up over.  Sexuality and children do not exist in different worlds, as much as some would like--and it's no crime to illustrate a sexual curiosity on film.  The intent of the film is clear, there is a purity and innocence within-- even if some are disturbed by the implication.I didn't fall in love with this film, but it was never less than interesting.  It succeeded in my mind, but it's for a particular audience--and even that audience seems to be divided.  Is it pretentious or is it art?  Those who know me realize I ask that question a lot--this film leans a little in both directions.  It's 3 1/2 stars from me, which I'll round up for nicely nuanced performances from the younger, more unknown actors.

What it is is that you got your quirky young woman who runs her own cab service for elderly people, and who has basically one customer. then you got your shoe sales guy who has just split with his wife and has two kids on his hands, a super precocious 5 or 6 year old, and a very quiet and smart 13 (or maybe 14) year old.There's also a woman who owns an art gallery where the quirky young woman wants to exhibit her quirky video work and it turns out the gallery owner has a deep dark secret which one of the other characters finds out about and who that other character is is a total surprise. So I won't tell you. Nyah nyah.The quirky young woman is played by Miranda July who also wrote and directed the film. There are a few things here and there that are actually very funny, and one or two things here and there that are sort of poignant in a way, kind of. But the film is kind of, in a way, lacking substance. Sort of. You can see that the filmmaker wants to show how people have a tough time connecting to each other because they don't know how to overcome the obstacles of built-in distancing so common in today's world and occasionally that does come through.The thing is that there is an effort being made here to convey that idea of overcoming (or trying to overcome) this emotional distance but we never really feel that anything is all that important to any character. The filmmaker TRIES to make us feel that, but it's pretty clear she is really trying (hence, the ""sort of"" and ""kind of"" and like that).The title of this review refers to a natural human function found only in men who scooge when their excitement about a partner of the opposite (or same) gender reaches its pinnacle, so to speak. The term is used by two blitheringly idiotic teenage girls who try out their, shall we say, mouth-based excitatory skills on our poor 13 (or 14) year old offspring of the (also very quirky) shoe sales guy who, in one scene, sets his hand on fire on purpose for some reason that totally escaped me.This is a movie for those who love movies that use the word ""scooge"" and actually I don't know of any other movie that DOES use the word ""scooge"". I wouldn't say this is a bad movie. I wouldn't say this is a great movie. It's a quirky movie that enjoys using the word scooge and stuff like that.I dunno. Maybe I'm just a fuddy duddy. In my opinion, if you want to see an indie film that is much stronger in the realm of emotional distancing and how we try to connect to each other, see ""Junebug"" which will be out on DVD in February or March 2006.

928711,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B000AMJFYA,Lleu Christopher,"[5, 6]","As I started watching this film, I was almost prepared to dismiss it as another indie film with little plot and cutsey, quirky characters. This one, however, grew on me as it went on. Me and You and Everyone We Know,  written, directed and starring Miranda July, has a truly distinctive style. I've seen it twice, and actually liked it better the second time, always a good recommendation for a film. The mediocre ones --the vast majority-- do not stand up to multiple viewings, at least for me. I think what makes it work is that it  is not merely straining to be offbeat and original for the sake of it, but truly has a voice and style of its own. The film follows the awkwardly blossoming romance between Christine (July), a performance artist who makes a living by running a taxi service for the elderly and Richard (John Hawkes), a recently separated shoe salesman. Richard has two children who engage in some romantic and sexual explorations of their own. This aspect of the film might make some viewers uncomfortable, but demonstrates July's  willingness to explore issues not often dealt with in most films.There are scenes and dialogue in this film that are unlikely to occur in real life. For example, when Christine and Richard meet outside of the mall where he works, they immediately fall into a poetic conversation about how the street names symbolize a timeline in their imaginary love affair. These two characters have barely met, and are unlikely to engage in such a conversation. Yet, taken as a whole, the film has a slightly surrealistic bent, so you are best off not watching it with realistic expectations. There is a consistent idiosyncratic rhythm to this film, as well as a warmth that does not descend into sentimentality. Overall, Me and You and Everyone We Know is about how lonely people connect or fail to connect in modern society. This is a familiar theme for films to take on, but this one does it in a way that reaches the viewer in an original way that is alternately sad, funny and uplifting.",4,Quirky connecting,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,2028,"['started', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'prepared', 'dismiss', 'indie', 'film', 'little', 'plot', 'cutsey', 'quirky', 'characters', 'one', 'however', 'grew', 'went', 'Me', 'Everyone', 'Know', 'written', 'directed', 'starring', 'Miranda', 'July', 'truly', 'distinctive', 'style', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', 'actually', 'liked', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'always', 'good', 'recommendation', 'film', 'mediocre', 'ones', 'vast', 'majority', 'do', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'least', 'think', 'what', 'work', 'not', 'merely', 'straining', 'be', 'offbeat', 'original', 'sake', 'truly', 'voice', 'style', 'own', 'film', 'awkwardly', 'blossoming', 'romance', 'Christine', 'July', 'performance', 'artist', 'who', 'living', 'running', 'taxi', 'service', 'elderly', 'Richard', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'recently', 'separated', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'Richard', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'engage', 'romantic', 'sexual', 'explorations', 'own', 'aspect', 'film', 'might', 'make', 'viewers', 'uncomfortable', 'July', 'willingness', 'explore', 'issues', 'not', 'often', 'most', 'are', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'film', 'are', 'unlikely', 'occur', 'real', 'life', 'example', 'when', 'Christine', 'Richard', 'meet', 'mall', 'where', 'immediately', 'fall', 'poetic', 'conversation', 'how', 'street', 'names', 'symbolize', 'timeline', 'imaginary', 'love', 'affair', 'two', 'characters', 'have', 'barely', 'met', 'are', 'unlikely', 'engage', 'such', 'conversation', 'taken', 'whole', 'film', 'slightly', 'surrealistic', 'bent', 'are', 'best', 'not', 'watching', 'realistic', 'expectations', 'consistent', 'idiosyncratic', 'rhythm', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'warmth', 'not', 'descend', 'sentimentality', 'Overall', 'Me', 'Everyone', 'Know', 'how', 'lonely', 'people', 'connect', 'fail', 'connect', 'modern', 'society', 'familiar', 'theme', 'films', 'take', 'one', 'way', 'viewer', 'original', 'way', 'alternately', 'sad', 'funny', 'uplifting']",N/A

Sherwin,"[0, 0]","Me And You And Everyone We Know provides a touching look at how difficult it can be for people trying to form meaningful relationships with others--especially in these times. Although the movie just didn't quite come off as powerfully as I hoped it would, it still is well worth seeing. The acting is rather convincing and the cinematography shines. The plot moves along at a good pace without the story becoming boring. This is a type of human interest story that will strike emotional chords in many people.When the action starts we witness Richard Swersey (John Hawkes) separating from his wife of several years. Although they decide to share custody of their two young boys Robby (Brandon Ratcliff) and Peter (Miles Thompson), we see the two children spending time mostly at their father's place and in school. Richard works as a shoe salesman in a retail department store; and although we slowly meet some of his neighbors the focus remains on Richard, his two young boys--and a young woman infatuated with him named Christine Jesperson (Miranda July). Christine means well; but she is so pathetically lonely that she cannot help but practically stalk Richard wherever he goes--one time even inviting herself into his car with him driving! Richard doesn't know her and wants to progress much more tentatively; and Christine feels great emotional pain over that. She works as a driver for a nursing home but understandably she wants a man she can love and respect in her life.All sorts of miniature story lines pop up as the movie progresses, each one being something of a brief vignette about the many different ways people can ""connect"" with one another. Some of these ways are healthier than others; but they all happen in real life.Will Richard eventually let Christine into his life or will he still want his space? After all, he burned his hand intentionally when he was upset over separating with his wife--can he handle a new woman so soon after his break-up? What about his coworker who likes to spend romantic time alone with women much younger than he is--what happens to him? And what happens when Christine submits a tape of her work to have it exhibited at an art museum--will they like her art and display it?

928713,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000AMJFYA,mirasreviews,"[6, 7]","Richard (John Hawkes) is a recently separated father of two boys, with a romantic, decidedly impractical personality. Christine (Miranda July) is an aspiring performance artist who falls in love with Richard when he sells her some shoes. But Richard doesn't seem keen on a new relationship at this moment. Meanwhile, his co-worker Andrew (Brad William Henke) is carrying on a strange flirtation with teenagers Rebecca (Najarra Townsend) and Heather (Natasha Slayton), who are classmates of Richard's son Peter (Miles Thompson). Peter and younger brother Robby (Brandon Ratcliff) are messing around in internet sex chatrooms. Sylvie (Carlie Westerman), a fastidious young neighbor, is planning way ahead for her life as a homemaker..I thought ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" was going to be a 2-star movie for the first half hour, in which a lot of aimless people have aimless conversations, seemingly in slow motion. But the film became watchable as the child characters became more prominent, bringing humor and interesting personalities to a story whose lead characters generate no interest whatsoever. You would have to like Christine and Richard to like the film, and they fell completely flat for me. But the kids are its saving grace. Brandon Ratcliffe as Robbie is especially natural and charming. Miranda July, who wrote and directed the film as well as stars in it, takes an intelligent, respectful approach to children, which I think is the film's strength. It's weakness is that this is extremely self-indulgent filmmaking. ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" is a quirky take on how people of various ages and personalities try to connect to one another in various ways for an assortment of reasons.The DVD (MGM 2005): The only bonus features are 6 deleted scenes.

The problem is, any many points, it seemed like it was trying to be. It comes off as contrived at times. I would even go as far as saying it had forced ""American Beauty"" qualities, from the standpoint of trying to capture the essence of life, especially in the forms of human relationships.The biggest problem for me is that I really didn't feel like I went anywhere with these characters. The only character I felt any sense of growth with was the 6 year old. Everyone else just kind of seemed to be part of random and strange relationships, mostly tied together through the exploration of sex or intimacy, but not in ways one might expect. While I enjoyed most of what I saw, I felt little attachment to any of them. But I came out of it being forgiving of that, because well, I WAS entertained for the most part and that's the best you can hope for in a movie these days.The scenes are very fresh and mostly entertaining. There's some good humor, symbolism and uniqueness to the settings and circumstances. It's not over the top or grotesque. It has a more simple and quiet tone. There's also a modern edge, which will appeal to many young people.In the end, I really admire the effort here.

Maybe she didn't, I dunno, but I think she did. The movie just isn't as creative and original as her spoken word cds though, and if I didn't know better I'd probably guess it was made in collaboration with Todd Solondz.It seemed like all of the characters that had more than a couple of lines had no confidence in their value as a person. So it's like the overall statement of the movie is oh we're all so beautifully damaged. It's a progressive, reactionary, increasingly popular basis for art films, but whether you're romanticizing achievement or failure, empty romance is empty romance, and that's the bottom line with this film. I didn't really like any of the characters, and it seemed like the viewer wasn't supposed to. I guess what did work for me about the movie is that it kept me optimistic somehow. I was still invested in where the characters would end up, but ultimately there didn't really seem to be much of an ending for any of them. I don't dislike the film, it definitely has it's moments of both comedy and poignance (the ""macaroni"" thing was pretty genius), but it frustrated me with it's contrived focus on finding romantic tragedy in banality. That territory has already been mined enough. As dull as one-dimensional success stories are, maybe giving the disaffected some models for success rather than encouraging them to celebrate failure should be the next frontier for edgy movies.The message seems to be even if you're damaged and messed up you can still find happiness in life, rather than you don't have to view yourself as damaged and messed up just because you are by most other people's standards, and that lack of empathy in July's approach seems to expose her as someone who isn't writing what she knows. She proves herself an attentive student of human behaviour, but seemingly asks an audience to have sympathy and empathy for characters she herself has none for. The lack of sentimentality with which the content and characters on her spoken word cds were handled made them a more potent window into the imagination and insight of her perspective. 7/10.",3,Please enter a title for your review,1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,2213,"['Miranda', 'weird', 'voice', 'thing', 'cds', 'start', 'was', 'omg', 'Maria', 'Bamford', 'totally', 'stole', 'voice', 'Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'dunno', 'think', 'did', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'creative', 'original', 'spoken', 'word', 'cds', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', ""'d"", 'probably', 'guess', 'was', 'made', 'collaboration', 'Todd', 'Solondz.It', 'seemed', 'characters', 'had', 'more', 'couple', 'lines', 'had', 'confidence', 'value', 'person', 'overall', 'statement', 'movie', ""'re"", 'so', 'beautifully', 'damaged', 'progressive', 'reactionary', 'increasingly', 'popular', 'basis', 'art', 'films', ""'re"", 'romanticizing', 'achievement', 'failure', 'empty', 'romance', 'empty', 'romance', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'characters', 'seemed', 'viewer', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'guess', 'what', 'did', 'work', 'movie', 'kept', 'optimistic', 'somehow', 'was', 'still', 'invested', 'where', 'characters', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'ultimately', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'film', 'definitely', 'moments', 'comedy', 'poignance', 'macaroni', 'thing', 'was', 'pretty', 'genius', 'frustrated', 'contrived', 'focus', 'finding', 'romantic', 'tragedy', 'banality', 'territory', 'already', 'been', 'mined', 'enough', 'As', 'dull', 'one-dimensional', 'success', 'stories', 'are', 'maybe', 'giving', 'disaffected', 'models', 'success', 'rather', 'encouraging', 'celebrate', 'failure', 'should', 'be', 'next', 'frontier', 'edgy', 'movies.The', 'message', 'be', 'even', ""'re"", 'damaged', 'messed', 'up', 'can', 'still', 'find', 'happiness', 'life', 'rather', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'view', 'damaged', 'messed', 'up', 'just', 'are', 'most', 'other', 'people', 'standards', 'lack', 'empathy', 'July', 'approach', 'expose', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'writing', 'what', 'attentive', 'student', 'human', 'behaviour', 'seemingly', 'audience', 'have', 'sympathy', 'empathy', 'characters', 'none', 'lack', 'sentimentality', 'content', 'characters', 'spoken', 'word', 'cds', 'were', 'handled', 'made', 'more', 'potent', 'window', 'imagination', 'insight', 'perspective', '7/10']",N/A

Most important, it doesn't obsess over these subjects. Nor does it use them for shock value or as dark dramatic peaks. They are just part of a larger effort to get at the particular sadness surrounding these characters, and to show how some people can overcome such sadness. The various ""out there"" vignettes that some may find objectionable aren't the movie's raison d'etre--they're just one of many ways the director tries to show what's wrong with modern life in general (and some specific kinds of lives in particular), and how some people try to make it right. Although the movie is oddly made and focuses on odd people, it's not trying to celebrate oddness for oddness's sake, like many similar movies. Yeah, this is still probably a love it or hate it movie given some of the scenes, but I think it's far far easier to love than to hate. The characters, particularly the children, all go through periods where they put themselves in immense moral and physical danger, but the movie doesn't exaggerate the dangers of modern life--every day, perfectly ""normal"" kids find perverts on the web, get flirty with the wrong adult in their neighborhood, or engage in stupid behavior with each other. Many of them are even lucky enough to do these stupid things without ruining their lives. That doesn't make the movie exploitative or unrealistic or overly focused on deviancy. In short, the movie has heart--it's genuinely concerned with finding that happy ending, with love, with right and wrong, with the increasing isolation found in many suburbs, and it works toward those goals with vignettes that will move you (keeping in mind that occasional cringing is a form of movement:-). And I must mention the fact that the movie is frequently HILARIOUS--another ""love it or hate it"" element that I think makes the movie special. The director has this ability to make certain situations screamingly funny without turning them into satire or draining them of verisimilitude, deep emotion, or, at times, creepiness. That's VERY hard to do. So please give this one a try. If you approach it with a clear understanding of two things--how blindly stupid and fearless adolescents can be (usually out of naivete rather than ill will), and how even good people can mess up their lives temporarily (for any number of reasons)--I think you'll agree it's one of the best American flicks to come out in quite a while.",5,"Unlike the usual indie shock piece, this one has heart and hilarity",1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,2507,"['wonderful', 'movie', 'most', 'other', 'indie', 'flicks', 'touch', 'seemingly', 'taboo', 'deviant', 'subjects', 'Most', 'important', ""n't"", 'obsess', 'subjects', 'use', 'shock', 'value', 'dark', 'dramatic', 'peaks', 'are', 'just', 'part', 'larger', 'effort', 'get', 'particular', 'sadness', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'show', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'overcome', 'such', 'sadness', 'various', 'there', 'vignettes', 'may', 'find', 'objectionable', 'are', ""n't"", 'movie', 'raison', ""d'etre"", ""'re"", 'just', 'one', 'many', 'ways', 'director', 'show', 'what', 'wrong', 'modern', 'life', 'general', 'specific', 'kinds', 'lives', 'particular', 'how', 'people', 'try', 'make', 'right', 'movie', 'oddly', 'made', 'focuses', 'odd', 'people', 'not', 'trying', 'celebrate', 'oddness', 'oddness', 'sake', 'many', 'similar', 'movies', 'Yeah', 'still', 'probably', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'given', 'scenes', 'think', 'far', 'far', 'easier', 'love', 'hate', 'characters', 'particularly', 'children', 'go', 'periods', 'where', 'put', 'immense', 'moral', 'physical', 'danger', 'movie', ""n't"", 'exaggerate', 'dangers', 'modern', 'life', 'day', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'kids', 'find', 'perverts', 'web', 'get', 'flirty', 'wrong', 'adult', 'neighborhood', 'engage', 'stupid', 'behavior', 'other', 'Many', 'are', 'even', 'lucky', 'enough', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'ruining', 'lives', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'exploitative', 'unrealistic', 'overly', 'focused', 'deviancy', 'short', 'movie', 'heart', 'genuinely', 'concerned', 'finding', 'happy', 'ending', 'love', 'right', 'wrong', 'increasing', 'isolation', 'found', 'many', 'suburbs', 'goals', 'vignettes', 'will', 'move', 'keeping', 'mind', 'occasional', 'cringing', 'form', 'movement', 'must', 'mention', 'fact', 'movie', 'frequently', 'HILARIOUS', 'love', 'hate', 'element', 'think', 'movie', 'special', 'director', 'ability', 'make', 'certain', 'situations', 'screamingly', 'funny', 'turning', 'satire', 'draining', 'verisimilitude', 'deep', 'emotion', 'times', 'creepiness', 'VERY', 'hard', 'do', 'So', 'please', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'approach', 'clear', 'understanding', 'two', 'things', 'how', 'blindly', 'stupid', 'fearless', 'adolescents', 'can', 'be', 'usually', 'naivete', 'rather', 'ill', 'will', 'how', 'even', 'good', 'people', 'can', 'mess', 'up', 'lives', 'temporarily', 'number', 'reasons', 'think', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'one', 'best', 'American', 'flicks', 'come', 'out', 'quite', 'while']",N/A

I found myself entirely incapable of getting behind it for much the same reason as the reviewers who panned it on RT--but then, I'm getting ahead of myself.This ensemble comedy, starring July herself as a performance artist (there's a stretch) who becomes interested in, and ultimately obsessed with, a recently-separated shoe salesman (&lt;em>Identity&lt;/em>'s John Hawkes), is ultimately about the on-again, off-again relationship between these two people, but also ropes in any number of subplots having to do with the shoe salesman's kids (&lt;em>Thirteen Conversations About One Thing&lt;/em>'s Miles Thompson and &lt;em>The Man in the Silo&lt;/em>'s Brandon Ratcliff, the best thing about the film), his neighbors Heather (Natasha Slayton in her only feature to date) and Rebecca (&lt;em>Dawning&lt;/em>'s Najarra Townsend) and their creepy relationship with Andrew (&lt;em>Must Love Dogs&lt;/em>' Brad William Henke), an ephebophile who lives across the street, and the curator of the art gallery where July's character Christine keeps trying to get her work shown (the late Tracy Wright).The film's problem in a nutshell, is that the quirkiness--oh, let's call a club a club, shall we?--the outright weirdnedss-for-weirdness'-sake that plays well enough in the shorts is an untenable medium for an hour-and-a-half-long film. Which is not to say it &lt;em>can't&lt;/em> be done; Rose Troche's exceptional 2001 film &lt;em>The Safety of Objects&lt;/em> treads a lot of this same ground, including the uncomfortable child-based sexuality and the general weirdness of one's neighbors--in a much more successful fashion. Troche's movie remains anchored in reality; July's spins off into spaces that simply don't, and probably can't, exist. Which is too bad, because there is so much to be said here about isolation and aloneness and our attempts at breaking through and actually connecting with another person on any sort of meaningful level...but it's all so piled under the weight of weird-for-weird's-sake that it is, at best, too muffled to understand, like an on-the-blink television on the other side of the wall of a cheap motel when you're trying to have illicit relations with... well, I won't go on with that simile here (but I will mention that the rest of it involved &lt;em>The Price Is Right&lt;/em>). **",2,Miranda July makes amazing shorts...but it doesn't transfer well to feature length.,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,2827,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Me', 'Everyone', 'Know', 'lt', '>', 'Miranda', 'July', '2005', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Miranda', 'July', 'short', 'films', 'lt', '>', 'Atlanta', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'pretty', 'high', 'ranking', 'Top', '100', 'Films', 'Time', 'list', 'made', 'first', 'experience', 'feature', 'debut', 'lt', '>', 'Me', 'Everyone', 'Know', 'lt', '>', 'probably', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'depressing', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'glowing', 'movie', 'picked', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'arenas', '7.3', 'IMDB', '81', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'found', 'entirely', 'incapable', 'getting', 'much', 'same', 'reason', 'reviewers', 'who', 'panned', 'RT', 'then', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'myself.This', 'ensemble', 'comedy', 'starring', 'July', 'performance', 'artist', 'stretch', 'who', 'interested', 'ultimately', 'obsessed', 'recently-separated', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'lt', '>', 'Identity', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'ultimately', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'relationship', 'two', 'people', 'also', 'number', 'subplots', 'having', 'do', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'kids', 'lt', '>', 'Thirteen', 'Conversations', 'One', 'Thing', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Miles', 'Thompson', 'lt', '>', 'Man', 'Silo', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Brandon', 'Ratcliff', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'neighbors', 'Heather', 'Natasha', 'Slayton', 'only', 'feature', 'date', 'Rebecca', 'lt', '>', 'Dawning', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Najarra', 'Townsend', 'creepy', 'relationship', 'Andrew', 'lt', '>', 'Must', 'Love', 'Dogs', 'lt', '>', 'Brad', 'William', 'Henke', 'ephebophile', 'who', 'street', 'curator', 'art', 'gallery', 'where', 'July', 'character', 'Christine', 'trying', 'get', 'work', 'shown', 'late', 'Tracy', 'Wright', '.The', 'film', 'problem', 'nutshell', 'quirkiness', 'oh', 'let', 'call', 'club', 'club', 'shall', 'outright', ""weirdnedss-for-weirdness'-sake"", 'well', 'enough', 'shorts', 'untenable', 'medium', 'hour-and-a-half-long', 'film', 'Which', 'not', 'say', '>', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lt', '/em', '>', 'be', 'done', 'Rose', 'Troche', 'exceptional', '2001', 'film', 'lt', '>', 'Safety', 'Objects', 'lt', '>', 'lot', 'same', 'ground', 'including', 'uncomfortable', 'child-based', 'sexuality', 'general', 'weirdness', 'one', 'neighbors', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'fashion', 'Troche', 'movie', 'anchored', 'reality', 'July', 'spins', 'off', 'spaces', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Which', 'too', 'bad', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'here', 'isolation', 'aloneness', 'attempts', 'breaking', 'actually', 'connecting', 'person', 'sort', 'meaningful', 'level', 'so', 'piled', 'weight', ""weird-for-weird's-sake"", 'best', 'too', 'muffled', 'understand', 'on-the-blink', 'television', 'other', 'side', 'wall', 'cheap', 'motel', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'have', 'illicit', 'relations', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'simile', 'here', 'will', 'mention', 'rest', 'involved', 'lt', '>', 'Price', 'Is', 'Right', 'lt', '/em', '>', '**']",N/A
928728,A361LE16VBQDP8,B000AMJFYA,Robert Bezimienny,"[29, 44]","This film is derivative, irritating, and offensive. It is far too self-conscious, earnestly retreading themes already worn thin by films such as Todd Solondz's ""Happiness"". Miranda July is a trite presence on screen, where she delivers unremittingly quirky dialogue in a cliched deadpan manner, accompanied by a synthesized soundtrack that is a bit too cute for its own good.  The fact that she portrays a conceptual artist and that this was in fact her own background adds to the feeling of self-indulgence that pervades the film.As remarked elsewhere, child actors are asked to deliver sexual dialogue.  This seems to serve no greater purpose than to make the audience 'uncomfortable', and to make the tired point that people are desperate for an emotional connection, sexuality being one of the means at their disposal.  It is fair to ask whether the children were exploited in being asked to participate in this film.Yes, some people are lonely.  Yes, it can be difficult for them to find someone with whom to share their lives.  Simply saying these things is not that interesting - and, in a cinematic sense, Miranda July does little more than say them; nowadays television  takes up the concerns of this film with regularity - the advantage that shows such as 'Six Feet Under' possess is in their scriptwriters, who know how to fashion complex characters that wear their quirks lightly, in contrast to this film where the characters are constructed from quirks alone. In a technical sense, the film is quite pedestrian - the cinematography, in particular, is uninteresting.  As a film-maker, Miranda July gives the impression of being unskilled, and possibly ignorant of the legacy of the great films of the past, indeed of narrative traditions in general - some viewers have seemingly found this naivety endearing, but others have found it dull and insulting.

928730,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000AMJFYA,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Like just about every independent film these days, ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" wears its quirkiness like a badge of honor.  It shows us a world populated by ""ordinary,"" ""average"" people, living lives of quiet desperation, who do and say the darndest things.Thus we have a father of two who lights his own hand on fire as a protest against his wife leaving him for another man; his overweight co-worker and neighbor who posts sexually explicit notes up in his windows for all the world - including two local underage girls - to see; two young brothers who engage in cyber sex chats with an unknown person on the other end; two teenaged girls who flirt with an older man but wind up initiating a much younger boy into the world of sex; and a flighty aspiring video artist who falls for a tentative shoe store clerk who has been woefully unsuccessful in the ways of love.Miranda July, who wrote and directed the movie (as well as playing the part of the young artist), clearly has a great deal of talent as a filmmaker.  She is able to create a universe which feels ever so slightly off-kilter, yet which has elements that are instantly recognizable to us in the audience.  We see that these are people trying to make some kind of intimate, honest connection with other human beings but who are often thwarted in that effort by technological roadblocks or the fears they have of being hurt or rejected.  Yet, the movie, for all its moments of truthfulness and meaning, often feels as if it is trying just a bit too hard to be profound.  Too often it feels forced and precious when it would be better if it were spontaneous and natural.  ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" comes across like one of those well-intentioned but pretentious projects made by first-year film students, a film so impressed with its own quirkiness and insight into human nature that it fails to convince us that it is actually telling us anything we didn't already know.This may seem like an overly harsh judgment to lay on a film that at least tries to do something meaningful and important, and I certainly do not mean to imply that there is not a great deal that is good about this movie (the acting, for one, although July is clearly better as a director than she is as an actress, hers being the one genuinely annoying performance in a sea of otherwise fine acting turns).  I guess, perhaps, it's just that independent filmmakers have been ramping up the ""quirkiness"" and ""weirdness"" quotient for so long now, that I've finally begun to lose patience with it.  My suspicion is that July clearly intends for us to identify with and like her characters, but I just found myself wanting to get as far away from them as possible.

On one hand, it seems like the type of movie that I'll like even more and appreciate on another level as time passes. On the other hand, it could also be the type of movie that's amusing to watch from time to time, but I ultimately never really love it. Like ""Bottle Rocket."" But I'd still be interested in seeing what Miranda July does next, if she continues to make films.It's hard to really explain the movie. Then again, it's not so hard. It's kind of your typical indie film about two screwed up people who meet and fall in love, even though they are both weird. And there are other characters that aren't central to the plot, also living similar lives, where they struggle to understand what's going on and so forth.The main characters are a weird chick who drives a shuttle for the elderly and wants to be an artist, and a shoe salesman who's getting divorced and struggling to relate to his kids. He's a bit of an oddball and looks dirty--like Vincent Gallo. The two meet by chance when she takes an old man to his department store to buy some rockin' blue athletic shoes.Other characters:-his buddy, who likes to talk dirty to a couple of high school girls, saying over the top hilarious stuff.-the two high school girls, who are curious about sex and take turns practicing oral sex on the shoe salesman's son to find out who's better at it-the shoe salesman's two kids, one who deals with the high school girls, and the other who engages in absolutely hilarious sex chat on the web with a stranger.-the neighbor girl, who interacts with the boys and collect housewares and linens, all planning for the day she'll have a husband and a daughter when she's all grown upThe movie is amusing, entertaining, and easy to watch all the way through. Again, I think back to ""Bottle Rocket,"" though, because it seems like things don't add up in the end. Like there isn't quite enough there. Like they get the story put together, but the finish is kind of a let down.

Lots of movies are like that, they throw together a bunch of quirky, weird characters that don't really have much to do with each other.  Instead of focusing in on the most interesting ones, this movie gives equal time to them all and the result is a rather incoherent mess that seems to think it's making an important point.  About what?  I can't figure it out.  I doubt there really is much of a point.  The adults in this movie are pretty pathetic, they are emotional wrecks and basically unsympathetic.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, per se.  I like lots of movies with unsympathetic lead characters.

I can't improve on what others have said, I'll just say it's about hopefulness, innocence and longing.  I don't know who these people are that were so askance at the sexual content and the kids- yes, it was certainly a surprise, but unerringly true to life- do you remember what you thought and said about sex when you were a kid?  The two teenage girls' shenanigans mirrored those of half my friends in junior high, and that was a long time ago.What is important are the outcomes of these daring escapades.  Granted, in the real world they could have resulted in troubling outcomes.  But this is a MOVIE, and it's about people longing to connect.  It's been a long, long time since I've seen a movie I liked this much (Lost in Translation, maybe).  I liken it to Bagdad Cafe, ones of my favorites, but even better. Also quirky like Little Miss Sunshine, but even better.For me there wasn't a moment that didn't ring true.  I found it wholly original, inspiring, wonderful.

This is almost the first sentence of the film's description, but it is quite accurate.Richard, (John Hawkes) freshly separated from his wife, pours lighter fluid on his hand and sets it afire, assuming that he won't get burned. He mistakes the non-burning trick with alcohol for the lighter fluid and ends up with a gauze-wrapped hand for most of the film. This scene was unsettling and made me wonder what I was in store for.Christine, (Miranda July, the film's writer and director) a lonely visual artist and cab driver for elderly folks, chances upon Richard at his job at the show store. Soon, she ends up paying him an unnatural amount of attention, making her look really creepy... Her face also remindes me of Mary Kay Letourneau, the teacher infamous for having sex with one of her students.Richard's 7 year-old (who looks a lot like the young Tiger Woods) innocently forms a relationship with a mysterious Internet chat room stranger, who assumes that he's an adult. He just innocently plays along since he doesn't know anything about kinky adult relationships, and then one day they meet in a park...Two secondary school girls tease one of Richard's co-workers and he begins to leave them dirty notes posted on his window. In a pathetic way, it's his way to have some human contact. These same girls practice getting down and dirty on Richard's 14 year-old, Peter (whose face reminds me of Eric Bogosian) to see if he can tell who is better at the act.There are some interesting, romantic scenes, like when Richard and Christine walk down the street to their cars, and Christine describes the walk as being like spending a lifetime together, with the end being the final street they come upon together.This film is refreshingly original because you simply don't know what is going to happen. There are delicate and raw, viceral moments. The acting is solid all around. Ask yourself if you have ever met people like some of the characters in the film.

928737,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000AMJFYA,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 7]","Miranda July's feature debut film `Me and You and Everyone We Know' has strange and unique quality that defies easy categorizing, like the profile of this prolific artist, who writes, directs and performs her works in a variety of media. Making a film comes naturally for her as part of her art, and it is undeniable that she has a talent as film director. But her film's quality, the characters in it in particular, is so quirky that I stated to wonder if she is not really interested in the world outside her.Not that those characters are devoid of charms; the ensemble of Miranda July's characters (one played by herself) is deeply flawed or tormented, mostly feeling too alone, and are trying to reach out to others. They are Richard (John Hawkes) a shoe salesman who recently experienced divorce, Christine (Miranda July) an aspiring video artist, Robby (Brandon Ratcliff), Richard's seven-year-old boy chatting on the net, Nancy (Tracy Wright), a lonely curator, and several others interconnected in the film's world..The backgrounds and personalities of these characters may not be as original as other reviewers say, but certainly July's screenplay is filled with original dialogues and concepts. Don't seek reality here in these words because a seven-year-old boy wouldn't exchange these obscene (and often funny ... or unfunny, depending on you) words with someone else even on the internet; or a husband loving his children would not torch his arm before the kids no matter how he is tormented. But these things happen in `Me and You and Everyone We Know.'But still, for all its occasional insightful moments and the hopes that are suggested (overall tone is fairly light), I couldn't come to like the quirky film exactly because of its quirkiness that are too obvious. You may like this, I don't know, but there is certain kind of smugness in the film's quirky quality, of which merit is solely being quirky.",3,"Quirky Charms, But Too Quirky for Its Own Good",1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,1920,"['Miranda', 'July', 'feature', 'debut', 'film', 'Me', 'Everyone', 'Know', 'strange', 'unique', 'quality', 'easy', 'categorizing', 'profile', 'prolific', 'artist', 'who', 'directs', 'works', 'variety', 'media', 'Making', 'film', 'naturally', 'part', 'art', 'undeniable', 'talent', 'film', 'director', 'film', 'quality', 'characters', 'particular', 'so', 'quirky', 'stated', 'wonder', 'not', 'really', 'interested', 'world', 'her.Not', 'characters', 'are', 'devoid', 'charms', 'ensemble', 'Miranda', 'July', 'characters', 'one', 'played', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'tormented', 'mostly', 'feeling', 'too', 'alone', 'are', 'trying', 'reach', 'out', 'others', 'are', 'Richard', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'who', 'recently', 'experienced', 'divorce', 'Christine', 'Miranda', 'July', 'aspiring', 'video', 'artist', 'Robby', 'Brandon', 'Ratcliff', 'Richard', 'seven-year-old', 'boy', 'chatting', 'net', 'Nancy', 'Tracy', 'Wright', 'lonely', 'curator', 'several', 'others', 'interconnected', 'film', 'world..The', 'backgrounds', 'personalities', 'characters', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'original', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'certainly', 'July', 'screenplay', 'filled', 'original', 'dialogues', 'concepts', 'Do', ""n't"", 'seek', 'reality', 'here', 'words', 'seven-year-old', 'boy', 'would', ""n't"", 'exchange', 'obscene', 'often', 'funny', 'unfunny', 'depending', 'words', 'someone', 'else', 'even', 'internet', 'husband', 'loving', 'children', 'would', 'not', 'torch', 'arm', 'kids', 'matter', 'how', 'tormented', 'things', 'happen', 'Me', 'Everyone', 'Know', 'still', 'occasional', 'insightful', 'moments', 'hopes', 'are', 'suggested', 'overall', 'tone', 'fairly', 'light', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'quirky', 'film', 'exactly', 'quirkiness', 'are', 'too', 'obvious', 'may', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'certain', 'kind', 'smugness', 'film', 'quirky', 'quality', 'merit', 'solely', 'being', 'quirky']",N/A

My girlfriend and I, however, found the film distasteful, if not downright horrifying.Setting aside the fact that the filmmaker constantly relies on the motif of children and teens as both subjects and objects of sexual perversion (those who have seen the film, I invite you to meditate at length upon the eliminative-coital activity, described by a rather frighteningly expressionless child, of ""pooping back and forth,"" and defy you to argue to me that it is anything other than revolting), I found this film incoherent and too precious by half, relying overmuch on self-consciously cute set pieces and vignettes, as if these isolated moments, devoid of a discernible narrative thread, were enough to qualify it as art.And this is precisely what bedevils this film the most: a crippling hyper-awareness of the procedures and tropology of the so-called art film, where everything must strain toward novel effect to the sacrifice of established cinematic boilerplate.If you enjoy disconnectedly oddball and perverse films, then this one is for you. Yet I can't help but think that *Me and You and Everyone We Know"" simply confirms what I have suspected for some time: that having a DVD case liberally bedecked with Palm d'Ors, those veritable ""Good Housekeeping Seals of Approval"" for the art school and caf&eacute; hipster set, is enough to elide the critical function of many who credit themselves with a high degree of discernment.So to those responsible for this inane exercise in forced whimsy, I poop this critique back to you--with my compliments.

Performance artist Miranda July, in her first film, wrote, directed and plays a leading role in a cast, with several exceptions and including three fey children, of nobody you ever heard of. They are so accepting of the bizarre and banal things that happen to them that you end up liking them and this misnomer of a movie.

928742,A1HD6I8YQPCJA7,B000AMJFYA,ZuluQueen,"[1, 2]","Honestly, I only really liked the last 10 minutes or so of this movie.The rest of the film annoyed me. It had the lack of reality that films likeNapoleon DynamiteandWelcome to the Dollhousehave, that universe that doesn't really exist. Some of the conversations in this film are completely unrealistic. Some of it reeks of hipsterishness and the banality of suburban life. Many scenes take place in the shoe section of a department store. Ugh.Some of the characters are really weird. A little girl fetishizes kitchen appliances and is already planning, of her own volition, her trousseau. A man flirts with two underage girls via the written word. And they're all connected, sort of the way the people inParis, Je T'Aime (Paris, I Love You)(another good film) are connected.However, the younger brother--Robby--is adorable and steals every scene away from his older costars.But the last part of the film was very touching. Not everything is resolved, and if something is, it's not 100 percent. But the message of the film is universal, and it is this message that make the film worth your while. Those last 10 minutes are worth waiting for.To borrow from E. M.
