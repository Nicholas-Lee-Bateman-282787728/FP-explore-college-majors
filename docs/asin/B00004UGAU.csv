So big bird, his teddy bear radar[cultural refernces abound]split up[he mails radar]and he starts his adventure back home. Along the way we meet the SLEAZE Brother,played with good fun By SCTV veterans, Joe Flaherty and Dave Thomas. The Sleazebrotheres operate a {F}UNFAIR,the worst funfair imaginable. They atteempt to kidnapBig Bird and turn him into a sideshow,but thsi being Sesame Street,it all works . Along the way Big Bird hitches a ride with turkey farmer waylon Jennings[who sings the lovely There Aint No Road too Long],stays ata farm with two children,one of whom Ruthie,later gows up to be LOONETTE on te BIG COMFY COUCH!}They sing EASY GOING DAY, probably the best song on an excellent soundtrack. Ernie and Bert and Big Bird pay homage to Alfred Hitchcock with a scene from North by Northwest,done with the susual Sesame street deftness.Of corse all is well and all will be well, and the end finds everyobe united a happy. This is a great DVD transfer,the picture and sound a quantum leap from the Vhs,which, having 5 children,I went through 3 in the intervening years.i have seen this movie literally hunderds of times, and it is a joy to watch. the song selections on the DVD are nice,otherwise the extras are nothing much.

552668,A33UCQJ1QHU8B,B00004UGAU,Andy Radke,"[1, 1]","I'm not ashamed to admit that I am almost 36, and just ordered this movie.......for myself!  I distinctly remember my parents taking my sister and I to see this at the theater in the Summer of 1985!  I enjoyed it then as a child of 8.....and I enjoy it now.  Not only for its nostalgia value, but the clever puns sprinkled throughout the film.  I love the cameos, especially Chevy Chase reprising his 'Saturday Night Live' news anchor shtick.It's great to see the original Sesame Street cast in this, as this was the cast of characters I grew up watching as a child.....Gordon, Susan, Linda, Maria, Luis, Olivia....they're all here.  The songs featured in the film were very well written and executed as well.  My favorite being ""One Little Star"" which tugs on the heartstrings just a little bit!  :)I love that this film was remastered and presented in widescreen for the first time.  To be able to see it the way it was originally presented in the theater is something I'm very happy about.My only gripe.....albeit a very small one, is the fact that for some reason Warner Bros. decided to include Elmo on the cover.  Extremely misleading as you only see the puppet for a grand total of maybe 3 or 4 seconds, and he doesn't utter a word.  In fact, this was around the time Elmo was first introduced to the world, and was controlled and voiced by a different puppeteer before Kevin Clash eventually took over and made Elmo what he is today.  Kids will look at this cover thinking Elmo plays some sort of substantial part in the film.  Again, a small gripe.I consider this film to be timeless.  Although kids who watch Sesame Street today may wonder where their favorite characters are, there is no arguing that the storyline will resonate with them, now and for years to come.

552669,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00004UGAU,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[4, 4]","This is an interesting movie in that it really shows realities of the human condition. The movie starts with a bird agency deciding that Big Bird can not be happy because he is not living with other birds. So, they decide he has to leave Sesame Street to live with a bird family. (The DODOs.) They expose a harsh reality here. More often than not, these agencies make decisions and pass judgments WITHOUT knowing what they are talking about or establishing the facts. (Especially agencies that are suppose to help people with disabilities.)If we want to go a bit further, the great Shakespeare said in ""King Lear:"" 'striving to better, oft we mar what's well.' Moving on, Ms. Finch (of the agency) goes to Sesame Street and convinces Big Bird he will be happier with the Dodos who live in Illinois. Back in SS New York, Big Bird's friends are of course upset, but they agree it is Big Bird's decision to make. BB's friend Mr. Snuffalupugus is especially sad, but BB convinces him he can visit.Without going on too long, the Dodos make the naive Big Bird look really intelligent. While BB can tolerate their unintelligence, he can not tolerate it when they won't let Mr. Snuffalupugus visit because he is not a bird. Big Bird runs away, and his friends back at SS see the story on tv and decide they have to look for him. His friends (despite their flaws) go off to look for him. (Even Oscar the Grouch!)But things are not going to be simple. Ms. Finch is still looking for BB to bring him back to the Dodos, and a corrupt entertainment duet is after Big Bird to use him for financial gain.While this movie may APPEAR to be for children, it raises many aspects of the human condition, (Agencies who don't know what they are doing, corruption, flawed friends trying their best, etc.) Between the suspense, comic relief, and good songs, this movie is seldom boring. In some ironic moments, some of BB's friends get close to him, but miss him. (Ernie and Bert find him, but lose him just as quickly. We're not sure whether to laugh or cry!)This movie may technically be for children, but I feel it has lasting value and should be watched by adults as well.",4,Realities of the Human Condition,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,2152,"['interesting', 'movie', 'really', 'realities', 'human', 'condition', 'movie', 'bird', 'agency', 'deciding', 'Big', 'Bird', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'not', 'living', 'other', 'birds', 'So', 'decide', 'leave', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'live', 'bird', 'family', 'DODOs', 'expose', 'harsh', 'reality', 'here', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'agencies', 'make', 'decisions', 'pass', 'judgments', 'knowing', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'establishing', 'facts', 'Especially', 'agencies', 'are', 'suppose', 'help', 'people', 'disabilities', 'want', 'go', 'bit', 'further', 'great', 'Shakespeare', 'said', 'King', 'Lear', ""'striving"", 'better', 'mar', 'what', 'well', 'Moving', 'Ms.', 'Finch', 'agency', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'convinces', 'Big', 'Bird', 'will', 'be', 'happier', 'Dodos', 'who', 'live', 'Illinois', 'Back', 'SS', 'New', 'York', 'Big', 'Bird', 'friends', 'are', 'course', 'upset', 'agree', 'Big', 'Bird', 'decision', 'make', 'BB', 'friend', 'Mr.', 'Snuffalupugus', 'especially', 'sad', 'BB', 'can', 'visit.Without', 'going', 'too', 'long', 'Dodos', 'make', 'naive', 'Big', 'Bird', 'look', 'really', 'intelligent', 'BB', 'can', 'tolerate', 'unintelligence', 'can', 'not', 'tolerate', 'when', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'Mr.', 'Snuffalupugus', 'visit', 'not', 'bird', 'Big', 'Bird', 'away', 'friends', 'back', 'SS', 'see', 'story', 'tv', 'decide', 'have', 'look', 'friends', 'flaws', 'go', 'look', 'Even', 'Oscar', 'Grouch', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'simple', 'Ms.', 'Finch', 'still', 'looking', 'BB', 'bring', 'back', 'Dodos', 'corrupt', 'entertainment', 'duet', 'Big', 'Bird', 'use', 'financial', 'gain.While', 'movie', 'may', 'APPEAR', 'be', 'children', 'many', 'aspects', 'human', 'condition', 'Agencies', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'corruption', 'flawed', 'friends', 'trying', 'best', 'etc', 'suspense', 'comic', 'relief', 'good', 'songs', 'movie', 'seldom', 'boring', 'ironic', 'moments', 'BB', 'friends', 'get', 'close', 'miss', 'Ernie', 'Bert', 'find', 'lose', 'just', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'laugh', 'cry', 'movie', 'may', 'technically', 'be', 'children', 'feel', 'lasting', 'value', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'adults', 'as', 'well']",Sesame Street Presents Follow that Bird VHS
552670,A3TJJHMWV3SFNI,B00004UGAU,"Brett Heitkam ""DVD obsessed""","[4, 8]","Hmm...it's very difficult for me to be mad about this DVD.  Follow that Bird was one of my favorite childhood films and when I found out it was entering the digital realm, I couldn't wait to own my own copy of it on a shiny never-wears-out disc.  The day it came out, I bought it...even though the back of the case said that it was ""standard"" (full frame) and only had Dolby 2.0 sound.  That's the equivalent of seeing it on video.  I was very disappointed.  Sure, it's a kids' movie...but it's a classic.  And yes, ""those cotton-pickin' black bars"" that come with widescreen movies annoy some unenlighted viewers.  But really.  At least give us standard on one side and widescreen on another.  As an interesting (if baffling) sidenote, to add insult to injury, the only extra on this disc besides scene selection is the theatrical trailer...AND it's in widescreen.  What's up with that, Warner Brothers???As for the sound, Dolby 2.0 is what is on most videocassettes and most TV shows.  If you have surround sound on your home theater system, 5.1 or DTS is the only way to go.  DVD is capable of so many things, and I used to think the WB was wonderful with their DVDs...but they have really disappointed me with this one (and Willy Wonka for that matter).  Come ON!  Widescreen TVs will be in everyone's living rooms within the next few years...why not start preparing for it now?

552671,A3EW2L59UBHQSG,B00004UGAU,Bruce Aguilar,"[2, 2]","I've loved this film since it first came out in 1985 and I'm so glad it's finally come to DVD.  It's a heartwarming story of family and belonging that all can relate to.  The Muppet humor is just as sharp as ever so adults will have no problem enjoying this fim as much as children do.  Fans of the show might be as happy as I was with the inclusion of Olivia in the cast.  She has  such a beautiful singing voice and luckily gets to use it in this film.  However, the most delightful treat for fans is to see Jim Henson once again performing Kermit and Ernie.  He's such a master puppeteer and has such good chemistry with the other characters (especially Bert).  Watch the subtle facial expressions he gives Kermit and the honest plafulness of Ernie.  A treat in deed.  We miss you Jim.As for the DVD itself, the picture is bright but somewhat soft like it's been transferred from video instead of film.  Clearly no restoration work has been done on picture or audio.  Also, I'm a purist and it's just not right to release a film in Pan and Scan without an OAR option as this release has done.  There are several places where a widescreen transfer is obviously missing and it just bugs me to no end.  The disc is bare bones with only a 'Jump to a song' option and the original trailer.

I can only say that I was afraid, and not feeling good about myself as a person that I could watch this, and still be cool. I see that I was wrong not to realize that Sesame Street will always be a part of my life, and that I took a piece of my life away from me, and threw it away, so I can have friends, and yet they wouldn't have cared. I'm sure that some of the girls I was sweet on in high school would've watched this anyway as they had little babies already. I regret having sold myself cheap this way as this was actually better than I first thought. It has a pretty good cast besides the usual Sesame Street actors with cameos of Chevy Chase doing his tribute to public television by reciting the theme song from Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, John Candy as a patrol man, and a host of others including Waylon Jennings who sings a good song in this. I got hooked up in trying to be cool with watching the sexual movies, and trying to laugh at the scenes where the women were moaning in ecstasy. This was considered normal in my high school, and I felt I had to steel myself against wholesome family movies as this. Mind you this is the beginning of politically correct movies as society tries to convince people that it doesn't matter as long as there's love, but in a way Ms. Finch has a point that Big Bird may have been better off living with birds, but if the birds don't portray love, and give love then Big Bird is better off being with people who will. In alot of ways this can apply to those who try to avoid this movie, or lie about watching it to impress people; you are missing out, and selling yourselves cheap.

A very heartfelt story that wisely puts the appealing Big Bird front and center in a versatile movie, I loved it as a child and recommend it wholeheartedly as a movie with true cross-generational appeal.Big Bird is happily living on Sesame Street as the movie opens, enjoying his life and his trustworthy diverse friends.  All that changes when a bird named Miss Finch of the satirical Feathered Friends Society fussily convinces Big Bird he'd be happier living exclusively with birds.  The remainder of the movie follows a very unhappy Big Bird as he tries aimlessly to walk back to Sesame Street from a place called Oceanview, Illinois.  He is trailed by both Miss Finch(voiced by Sally Kellerman of the movie ""MASH"",) and the true friends who want to see him safely on Sesame Street again.This is a wonderful movie with underappreciated songs and a sizable amount of star cameos from the likes of Waylon Jennings and John Candy.

The films songs, ""Upside Down World"", ""Easy Goin' Day"", ""Ain't No Road Too Long"" and Big Birds lament ""I'm a Blue Bird"", are songs which have stayed alive for many children the world over.Sesame Street's Follow that Bird, as I recall, was the first film to tell a story about the streets characters and we were invited to see more of their world ... the street itself was rebuilt and expanded and had a rich realistic feel and artistically the look was very credible and contrasted the Muppet characters more imaginatively.Everything about the production was inspiring, the story was clear and tight, characters were very well performed, the puppetry as you might expect was first rate and parents enjoyed seeing the comic talents from John Candy and Chevy Chase who cameo ... Kermit even makes an appearance as his role as Muppet Reporter and if you look carefully you can see Elmo sometimes in the background, but you have to remember, this was all before he became a big star.Follow that Bird is really Big Birds story and for a generation who remember Sesames early years it is about time the big yellow chap got some cheers again for being such an inspiring figure. The production naturally has the Henson stamp on it but this is a film which once again supports the goals and aspirations of The Children's Television Workshop and if you haven't seen this film yet or you are thinking of showing it to your children for the first time, then do purchase a copy as this film does not play down to kids at all ... as with all the early Henson productions and related projects the Henson troop found themselves involved in, they always conveyed what they felt they would want their children to understand about the world and what they created was first rate entertainment which had something real in the offering.This edition is presented in it's original theatrical format.",5,""" come fly with me in an upside world ... there's fish that fall out of the sea...""",1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,1939,"['one', 'finest', 'Muppet', 'productions', 'mid', '1980', 'films', 'songs', 'Down', 'World', 'Easy', 'Goin', 'Day', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'No', 'Road', 'Too', 'Long', 'Big', 'Birds', 'lament', ""'m"", 'Blue', 'Bird', 'are', 'songs', 'have', 'stayed', 'alive', 'many', 'children', 'world', 'Street', 'Follow', 'Bird', 'recall', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'tell', 'story', 'streets', 'characters', 'were', 'invited', 'see', 'more', 'world', 'street', 'was', 'rebuilt', 'expanded', 'had', 'rich', 'realistic', 'feel', 'artistically', 'look', 'was', 'very', 'credible', 'contrasted', 'Muppet', 'characters', 'more', 'imaginatively.Everything', 'production', 'was', 'inspiring', 'story', 'was', 'clear', 'tight', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'performed', 'puppetry', 'might', 'expect', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'parents', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'comic', 'talents', 'John', 'Candy', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'who', 'cameo', 'Kermit', 'even', 'appearance', 'role', 'Muppet', 'Reporter', 'look', 'carefully', 'can', 'see', 'Elmo', 'sometimes', 'background', 'have', 'remember', 'was', 'became', 'big', 'star.Follow', 'Bird', 'really', 'Big', 'Birds', 'story', 'generation', 'who', 'remember', 'Sesames', 'early', 'years', 'time', 'big', 'yellow', 'chap', 'got', 'cheers', 'again', 'being', 'such', 'inspiring', 'figure', 'production', 'naturally', 'Henson', 'stamp', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'goals', 'aspirations', 'Children', 'Television', 'Workshop', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'yet', 'are', 'thinking', 'showing', 'children', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'do', 'purchase', 'copy', 'film', 'not', 'play', 'down', 'kids', 'early', 'Henson', 'productions', 'related', 'projects', 'Henson', 'troop', 'found', 'involved', 'always', 'conveyed', 'what', 'felt', 'would', 'want', 'children', 'understand', 'world', 'what', 'created', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'entertainment', 'had', 'something', 'real', 'offering.This', 'edition', 'presented', 'original', 'theatrical', 'format']",Sesame Street Presents Follow that Bird VHS

However, once settled in with the Dodos, Big Bird decides that they are even too &quot;brainless&quot; for him.  In the middle of the night, Big Bird sneaks out of the Dodos home and begins a kind of &quot;lost&quot; roadtrip.  While Big Bird is out on the road, the rest of the Sesame Street gang, having received a rather sad home sick letter from Big Bird, set out on their own to try to find and bring back home their beloved friend.  Eventually, the rest of the gang do find Big Bird being held captive by a couple of greedy exhibitionists.  Of course, in the end they manage to free our giant feathered friend, the bad guys are caught, and everybody lives happily ever after.Even though not as good as the Muppet series of films (the first 3 Muppet films anyway), &quot;Follow That Bird&quot; truly is a magical film for all ages, and can be enjoyed by anyone who has an imagination and wants to relive some of their childhood memories.

So it could be sentiment of that.  You get to see the classic Charictors in some of their great momments!  Including that it starts with the grouch national anthem sung by Oscar.Its good humor, good songs ok quite corny at times but also quite sweet.  It shows the whole gang out to help their friend find his way home.  With a few embedded lessons like bad things can happen if you accept rides from strangers.  Without terrifying them.  Showing that family is not just who you look like  but who you love.  Especially good lesson for adopted children.  that friends are valuable family too.quite frankly I think that No elmo is a major plus!  Remember when Kermit the frog was a big hit?

HELP!"" when he is caught by the Sleaze Brothers.The movie opens with Oscar the Grouch (Caroll Spinney, who also played Big Bird, of course) introducing to us his ""Grouch Anthem,"" which at mid-song features other Grouches moaning while Oscar delivered his spoken monologue, before they all sing the song's chorus (""Don't let the sunshine spoil the rain ...""). It then goes to Big Bird pumping up an inflatable ""W"" which then flies high away and into the sky, where it turns into the ""W"" in the Warner Bros. shield logo.The movie resumes with the Feathered Friends organization, who eye Big Bird for adoption by a dodo family living in Oceanview, IL, whose own son (voiced by Eddie Deezen) and daughter (voiced by Cathy Silvers, the daughter of the late Phil Silvers) are named after the two most famous Osmond siblings. Miss Finch (Sally Kellerman) is one of the key people of the FF. We then cut to Sesame Street where Big Bird currently is, where we see the movie's title graphic. Big Bird, after he bids adieu on SS, initially takes to loving his new family, but soon grew tired of them when their traditional family life didn't match that of his own on SS. He left them because only his bird friends could visit them, not his best friend Snuffleupagus. This is where the real journey now starts.As Big Bird makes his way back to SS, he has to deal with not only Miss Finch, but now he also must face the Sleaze Brothers (Joe Flaherty as Sid, and Dave Thomas as Sam), two circus owners who hope to use him for a major attraction of theirs (The Blue Bird of Happiness, which we witness later on). Big, as Miss Finch refers to him, initially gets help from a turkey truck driver (portrayed by late country musician Waylon Jennings), to which we cue the song ""Ain't No Road Too Long.""At the end of the scene where we see Big Bird rescued by way of jumping off of the Sleaze Brothers' truck and onto the front hood of a Volkswagen Beetle, courtesy of Gordon and Olivia. The Sleazes are then apprehended by the state trooper (John Candy) who is assisted by a black boy who we'd seen earlier in the film, for which he accused one of the Sleazes of stealing his apple.Big Bird returns to SS, and the movie ends after Maria tells Miss Finch all about Sesame Street and its gang.I also dug the Caroll Spinney interview bonus featurette.",5,This Is A Good Movie!,1249603200,"08 7, 2009",2009,2428,"['movie', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie', 'include', 'Big', 'Bird', 'screaming', 'HELP', 'HELP', 'when', 'caught', 'Sleaze', 'Brothers.The', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'Grouch', 'Caroll', 'Spinney', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'Big', 'Bird', 'course', 'introducing', 'Grouch', 'Anthem', 'mid-song', 'features', 'other', 'Grouches', 'moaning', 'Oscar', 'delivered', 'spoken', 'monologue', 'sing', 'song', 'chorus', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'sunshine', 'spoil', 'rain', 'then', 'Big', 'Bird', 'pumping', 'up', 'inflatable', 'W', 'then', 'high', 'away', 'sky', 'where', 'W', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'shield', 'logo.The', 'movie', 'resumes', 'Feathered', 'Friends', 'organization', 'who', 'eye', 'Big', 'Bird', 'adoption', 'dodo', 'family', 'living', 'Oceanview', 'IL', 'own', 'son', 'voiced', 'Eddie', 'Deezen', 'daughter', 'voiced', 'Cathy', 'Silvers', 'daughter', 'late', 'Phil', 'Silvers', 'are', 'named', 'two', 'most', 'famous', 'Osmond', 'siblings', 'Miss', 'Finch', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'one', 'key', 'people', 'FF', 'then', 'cut', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'where', 'Big', 'Bird', 'currently', 'where', 'see', 'movie', 'title', 'graphic', 'Big', 'Bird', 'adieu', 'SS', 'initially', 'loving', 'new', 'family', 'soon', 'grew', 'tired', 'when', 'traditional', 'family', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'own', 'SS', 'left', 'only', 'bird', 'friends', 'could', 'visit', 'not', 'best', 'friend', 'Snuffleupagus', 'where', 'real', 'journey', 'now', 'Big', 'Bird', 'way', 'back', 'SS', 'deal', 'not', 'only', 'Miss', 'Finch', 'now', 'also', 'must', 'face', 'Sleaze', 'Brothers', 'Joe', 'Flaherty', 'Sid', 'Dave', 'Thomas', 'Sam', 'two', 'circus', 'owners', 'who', 'hope', 'use', 'major', 'attraction', 'theirs', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'Happiness', 'witness', 'later', 'Big', 'Miss', 'Finch', 'refers', 'initially', 'help', 'turkey', 'truck', 'driver', 'portrayed', 'late', 'country', 'musician', 'Waylon', 'Jennings', 'cue', 'song', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'No', 'Road', 'Too', 'Long', 'end', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'Big', 'Bird', 'rescued', 'way', 'jumping', 'Sleaze', 'Brothers', 'truck', 'front', 'hood', 'Volkswagen', 'Beetle', 'courtesy', 'Gordon', 'Olivia', 'Sleazes', 'are', 'then', 'apprehended', 'state', 'trooper', 'John', 'Candy', 'who', 'assisted', 'black', 'boy', 'who', ""'d"", 'seen', 'earlier', 'film', 'accused', 'one', 'Sleazes', 'stealing', 'apple.Big', 'Bird', 'returns', 'SS', 'movie', 'Maria', 'Miss', 'Finch', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'gang.I', 'also', 'dug', 'Caroll', 'Spinney', 'interview', 'bonus', 'featurette']",Sesame Street Presents Follow that Bird VHS

Big Bird hires his friend named Snuffy to watch his nest while his is gone.And word spends to a monster named Gover, Count who loves to count. Once in Oceanview Big Bird meets the dodos and says, ""I'm Big Bird."" And Daddy Dodo says, ""No your not your Big Dodo."" Big Dodo. I thought his name is Big Bird, not Big Dodo. They live in a somewhat bird house. Big Bird sends Maria a letter because before he left he promised to write.
