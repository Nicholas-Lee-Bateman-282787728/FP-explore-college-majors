The first volume left me, of course, wanting to own the rest of the series. I was hoping that Warner Brothers would follow with a Volume 2, and now it has finally arrived and was definitely worth the wait.Each one of these films here is a delight, with Conway sleuthing his way through various scenarios and proving to be an amusing lothario in each one. My particular favorite is ""The Falcon in Hollywood"", because it is not only a nifty-little mystery, but it is also a behind-the-scenes look at the RKO studio lot of the era. Very cool.Although only 2 discs, the brief running time of each film makes for all six films to fit on the dual-layer DVDs with fine quality (and a great value!). All 6 films in the set have been remastered for the occasion, and are a distinct improvement from the fuzzy, contrasty television broadcasts (telling sign, no more cue-marks at reel changes!). Not only is the picture far improved, but the sound is robust and crystal clear, far beyond normal expectation for RKO B-pictures that are nearly 70 years old.For any fan of The Falcon, or other mystery series of similar vintage, this collection is recommended with sincere praise.",5,WONDERFUL!

In fact, I can see some similarities in plot lines between several of the films. George Sanders did both characters near simultaneously with style and debonair charm. For whatever reason, his depictions as the Falcon were taken over by Tom Conway, who ended up doing a very nice job filling in for the iconic Sanders. Mr Conway's style was almost identical to that of Mr Sanders, debonair and witty. And the Falcon hardly ever met a woman he didn't try to charm. The Falcon is one of those characters that always seems able to get mixed up in crimes, murders and whatnot despite just simply minding his own business. Many beautiful women seek him out to solve the mysteries that endanger or perplex them. While there is some similarity to all the movies - people need help, Falcon saves the day, Falcon frustrates bumbling cops - there is enough difference to keep it all entertaining.

This DVD set is all Tom Conway and presents his final films as the Falcon. These are all well-made films that move along at a rapid pace (especially ""The Falcon In Hollywood""), have interesting characters, and some comic relief. My favorite is ""The Falcon In San Francisco"", but there's not one of them that's a bad film, and they're fun to watch late in the evening when you don't want to see any of the ""entertainment"" offered on broadcast TV or cable.This is a 2-DVD set with 3 films on each disc. Although the old RKO films are great, the packaging of the DVD set is below average and could have easily been made more appealing by Warner Brothers simply by choosing a more colorful lobby card for the cover. Same with the first volume that was issued last year. And I don't believe any ""restoration"" work was done on these films for DVD release.  I recorded the first four of these six films off TCM about 5 years ago onto DVD-Rs, and TCM presented them in high quality; I think the quality of what TCM presented is about as good as the official DVD release now. I'm also wondering about the final three Falcon films from 1948 and 1949, ""The Devil's Cargo"", ""Appointment With Murder"", and ""Search For Danger"", all of which starred John Calvert as the Falcon. I've never seen them, maybe they aren't worthwhile series entries, but could have been a nice bonus to include them here as a third disc which I'm sure wouldn't be any skin off anyone's teeth.Highly recommended.

In fact, the first series with George Sanders was very &#34;The Saint&#34; - esque; which had The Falcon going to court because George Sanders was both The Saint and The Falcon and the powers that be didn't like the trademark infringement of The Falcon on The Saint.  Eventually Tom Conway, George Sander's brother, took over the role of The Falcon.  This collection of Tom Conway's Falcon is classy and sparkling.  It oddly seems more like a television series (again in the mode of Roger Moore's Saint), than full out movies; but fun, nonetheless.",4,Charming,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,829,"['name', '34', 'Falcon', '34', 'might', 'think', 'character', 'mysterious', 'crime', 'fighter', '34', 'Shadow', '34', '34', 'Whistler', '34', '34', 'Falcon', '34', 'more', 'vein', '34', 'Saint', '34', '34', 'Thin', 'Man', '34', 'series', 'gentleman', 'detective', 'fact', 'first', 'series', 'George', 'Sanders', 'was', 'very', '34', 'Saint', '34', 'esque', 'had', 'Falcon', 'going', 'court', 'George', 'Sanders', 'was', 'Saint', 'Falcon', 'powers', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'trademark', 'infringement', 'Falcon', 'Saint', 'Eventually', 'Tom', 'Conway', 'George', 'Sander', 'brother', 'took', 'over', 'role', 'Falcon', 'collection', 'Tom', 'Conway', 'Falcon', 'classy', 'sparkling', 'oddly', 'more', 'television', 'series', 'again', 'mode', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Saint', 'full', 'movies', 'fun', 'nonetheless']","The Falcon Mystery Movie Collection, Volume 2"
