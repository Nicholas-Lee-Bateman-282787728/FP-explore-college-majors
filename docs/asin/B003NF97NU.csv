Please whip the donkeys harder or whatever you do to make DVDs... You guys are part of our lives. We are eating Rolos again and sitting on people's heads. I long for the day when I can crap myself and ask for my D Pants to be hosed off. I begged my wife for some Wait Mates until Iron Man 2 opens. Hot Dogs are on the menu again. Life changing - for the better or worse. You guys are awesome.
