Obviously, if your name is Rockfeller, a lot.Does anyone remember the young Frenchman named Christophe Rocancourt who tore through NYC and LA posing as a Rockfeller a few years back?  Christophe and Christian. Both European. One conned the world for 20 years.  The other, too young and inexperienced, only lasted a couple of years.  One is in prison for life, the other is a French chef!Eric McCormack does not have the 'creep' factor to play this role as it should have been played. He is, after all, Will of Will & Grace.  He's too sweet a guy, although a very talented actor, singer and dancer.This made-for-tv-movie is more the wife's story than the husband's.  Still, Sandra Boss comes across as the brilliant businesswoman, daffy-in-love wife. As the FBI Agent asks her over and over, 'How could you NOT know?!&#34; (Her husband was a con man and not a Rockefeller)The film was made in Canada and the settings (trying hard to be NYC) are lovely. The colors brilliant. The interiors to-die-for. The acting is very low-key. No one is chewing the wallpaper. There is little, if any, anger on the part of the devastated wife and mother.  The only emotional thing she does is throw her wedding ring across the table during the divorce hearing.The daughter Snooks is adorable and an excellent little actress.  Eric McCormack tries really hard but just isn't convincing as Clark Rockfeller. Who in Hollywood COULD play this role to the hilt?  Had this happened 30 years ago I would have cast Jack Nicholson. Everyone else in the movie is forgetable. I don't even remember the real name of the actress who played the wife! My bad!I gave it 4 stars because it was enjoyable to watch from start to finish. However, I had just finished Mark Seal's wonderful book, The Man In The Rockfeller Suit. You must get this book! A treasure trove of information about 'Clark' and his beginnings, middles and ends.  This story has also been covered by CBS 48 Hours and Dateline NBC over the years.  Everyone is fascinated with this guy. Even though it isn't quite up to my exacting standards, I would still recommend it.",4,WHAT'S IN A NAME?,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,2123,"['What', 'name', 'Obviously', 'name', 'Rockfeller', 'lot.Does', 'anyone', 'remember', 'young', 'Frenchman', 'named', 'Christophe', 'Rocancourt', 'who', 'tore', 'NYC', 'LA', 'posing', 'Rockfeller', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Christophe', 'Christian', 'European', 'One', 'conned', 'world', '20', 'years', 'other', 'too', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'only', 'lasted', 'couple', 'years', 'One', 'prison', 'life', 'other', 'French', 'chef', 'Eric', 'McCormack', 'not', 'have', ""'creep"", 'factor', 'play', 'role', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'Will', 'Will', 'Grace', 'too', 'sweet', 'guy', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'singer', 'dancer.This', 'made-for-tv-movie', 'more', 'wife', 'story', 'husband', 'Still', 'Sandra', 'Boss', 'brilliant', 'businesswoman', 'daffy-in-love', 'wife', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'over', 'over', 'could', 'NOT', 'know', '34', 'husband', 'was', 'con', 'man', 'not', 'Rockefeller', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Canada', 'settings', 'trying', 'hard', 'be', 'NYC', 'are', 'lovely', 'colors', 'brilliant', 'interiors', 'to-die-for', 'acting', 'very', 'low-key', 'one', 'chewing', 'wallpaper', 'little', 'anger', 'part', 'devastated', 'wife', 'mother', 'only', 'emotional', 'thing', 'throw', 'wedding', 'ring', 'table', 'divorce', 'hearing.The', 'daughter', 'Snooks', 'adorable', 'excellent', 'little', 'actress', 'Eric', 'McCormack', 'really', 'hard', 'just', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'Clark', 'Rockfeller', 'Who', 'Hollywood', 'COULD', 'play', 'role', 'hilt', 'Had', 'happened', '30', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'cast', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'forgetable', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'real', 'name', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'wife', 'bad', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'start', 'finish', 'However', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'Mark', 'Seal', 'wonderful', 'book', 'Man', 'Rockfeller', 'Suit', 'must', 'get', 'book', 'treasure', 'trove', 'information', ""'Clark"", 'beginnings', 'middles', 'story', 'also', 'been', 'covered', 'CBS', '48', 'Hours', 'Dateline', 'NBC', 'years', 'Everyone', 'fascinated', 'guy', 'Even', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'exacting', 'standards', 'would', 'still', 'recommend']",N/A
1338719,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B003ES5JVU,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[7, 7]","Who is Clark Rockefeller?  He's a con man, well played by Eric Mccormack in this Lifetime made for TV movie, who discovers the doors that open in America for someone with the last name of Rockefeller.  He woos and marries Sandra Boss (Sherry Stringfield) a woman who is brilliant in business and nave socially.  But most of the Boston social scene have been taken in by him.  Its members are very tolerant of and even enchanted by the eccentricities of a man they think is a wealthy member of the Rockefeller clan.After all, only a Rockefeller could have his dog attend his wedding, but not his family.  He says he didn't want his famous relatives distracting from his bride on ""her day.""  And of course he doesn't perform ordinary work.  He spends his workday on the computer helping the economies of third world countries while his wife toils in the marketplace.And when they have a daughter, the child adores him, probably because of his wonderful imagination and story telling abilities.  But as the years go by, Sandra finds herself less enthralled by her husband, and asks for a divorce.  That's when she learns that the man she married has absolutely nothing;  that she has been the sole financial support of the marriage.  Not only is her husband's persona a fake, but all his ""valuable"" property is fake as well, including his ""original"" oil paintings.Nevertheless, she agrees to a settlement (he is the father of her child), but when he kidnaps their daughter while on a supervised visit, the police delve further into his past, and learn that this man is probably  very dangerous, and is possibly a murderer.This is a well-acted, engrossing movie, that takes place amid beautiful settings, and is based on a true story.

1338723,A3F106MT56ZMGB,B003ES5JVU,Peter Piper,"[1, 1]","I rented this movie on a lark and enjoyed it.  It really is not bad at all for a TV movie although it leaves out a lot of detail.It whetted my appetite for the book, ""The Man in the Rockefeller Suit"" which tells a lot more.  The movie focuses mostly on the period when the faux Rockefeller kidnapped his daughter, then tells the story of his marriage in flashback form.  You get only a brief glimpse of his life before that point, even though that earlier period of his life is really just as interesting.  I guess you'd need a four hour movie or more to really focus on the earlier events.I believe this film does go too far in unfairly prejudicing the viewer into thinking that he may have killed two people.  There is some circumstantial evidence that he may have done that but the case has yet to go to trial so the film should not make such broad insinuations.The most interesting thing would be if Rockefeller, aka Gerhartsreiter would write a book himself, but that is not going to happen as long as he is behind bars.Overall a decent portrayal with reasonable acting.",4,See the movie if you don't feel like reading the book,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,1075,"['rented', 'movie', 'lark', 'enjoyed', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'TV', 'movie', 'out', 'lot', 'detail.It', 'whetted', 'appetite', 'book', 'Man', 'Rockefeller', 'Suit', 'lot', 'more', 'movie', 'mostly', 'period', 'when', 'faux', 'Rockefeller', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'then', 'story', 'marriage', 'flashback', 'form', 'get', 'only', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'life', 'point', 'even', 'earlier', 'period', 'life', 'really', 'just', 'interesting', 'guess', ""'d"", 'need', 'four', 'hour', 'movie', 'more', 'really', 'focus', 'earlier', 'events.I', 'believe', 'film', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'unfairly', 'prejudicing', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'two', 'people', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'case', 'yet', 'go', 'trial', 'so', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'make', 'such', 'broad', 'insinuations.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'Rockefeller', 'aka', 'Gerhartsreiter', 'would', 'write', 'book', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'as', 'long', 'bars.Overall', 'decent', 'portrayal', 'reasonable', 'acting']",N/A
