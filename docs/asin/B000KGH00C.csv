1034018,ARU2H2PYTNCAX,B000KGH00C,e_j_buster,"[2, 7]","My grandmother is 90 years old and is in an advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease.  Nevertheless, she is still able to enjoy watching Murder, She Wrote!Up until recently, I had never watched an episode of Murder, She Wrote.  This is mainly because I don't enjoy whodunit murder mysteries, so I never had any interest in watching the show.  But recently I have been spending a lot of time with my grandmother.  She is in a stage of Alzheimer's disease where she really can't, for safety reasons, be left alone.Although I am still a familiar face to her, she no longer realizes that I am her grandchild.Most days she usually does okay.  But then there are days where she becomes worried that she needs to get to her girls.  She is referring to her four daughters (my mother and three aunts), and she worries that they don't know where she is.Fortunately, no matter how bad things get with my grandmother, an episode of `Murder, She Wrote' always brings happiness to her.  Although she can't follow the plots in most TV programs, she seems able to understand, without any problems, the 'Murder She Wrote' plots.I now understand why this program is so popular with the elderly.  It was written specifically for people who are no longer in possession of all of their faculties.  The stories and characters in MSW are all elemental type ideas that don't require complex thinking.  This explains why Alzheimer patients are able to understand and enjoy the episodes.  To give you an idea of the elemental type things that make up an MSW episode, here is a brief list of recurring ideas that might come up in an average episode of MSW:  suspicious looking character, a crime was committed, a threat was made, a lot of money might be involved, Cabot Cove, Jessica Fletcher smells a rat, armed and dangerous men/thugs, escape, Jessica Fletcher writes murder mystery novels, an arrest is made, Jessica Fletcher is trustworthy.The creators of Murder She Wrote have also cleverly created situations in the show that will stroke the ego of an elderly person by making the elderly person feel smart.  For example, there is a scene where Jessica Fletcher is studying a crime scene and she is re-creating the possible crime scenario in her mind.  In an exaggerated slow motion style, she imagines that she is pointing a gun and firing, just like the bad guy may have done.  So without a word being spoken by JB Fletcher, it can be figured out by an elderly viewer that Fletcher is trying to re-create the crime scenario in her head as a means for possibly solving the case.  This may seem like a small thing.  But anything that can make an Alzheimer patient feel smart has got to be a good thing.Although I do not personally enjoy watching Murder She Wrote, I now appreciate the role that it can play in the life of an elderly person.  As television art, Murder She Wrote is a pioneering effort in the area of Alzheimer's care.Update:  I hadn't watched all of the episodes in season 5 when I wrote the above review.  After watching a few more of the episodes, I have to say that some of the episodes are not suitable for children under the age of 18.  In at least 1 of the episodes, the male guest star offers to share his bed with JB Fletcher.  And in another episode, Fletcher dresses up as a bimbo and hangs out in a tavern.  In the last episode that I watched, Fletcher used a four-letter cuss word.  This means that MSW is not as wholesome as we have been led to believe.  But in fairness, the show was made for the elderly, not for children.  So my five star rating stands.  Just make sure to put the kids to bed before you pop in an episode of Murder, She Wrote.",5,Great for Alzheimer patients,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,3651,"['grandmother', '90', 'years', 'old', 'advanced', 'stage', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'Nevertheless', 'still', 'able', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Up', 'recently', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'episode', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'mainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'whodunit', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'never', 'had', 'interest', 'watching', 'show', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'grandmother', 'stage', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'where', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'safety', 'reasons', 'be', 'left', 'am', 'still', 'familiar', 'face', 'no', 'longer', 'am', 'grandchild.Most', 'days', 'usually', 'okay', 'then', 'are', 'days', 'where', 'worried', 'get', 'girls', 'referring', 'four', 'daughters', 'mother', 'three', 'aunts', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'is.Fortunately', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'get', 'grandmother', 'episode', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'always', 'happiness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'plots', 'most', 'TV', 'programs', 'able', 'understand', 'problems', ""'Murder"", 'Wrote', 'plots.I', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'program', 'so', 'popular', 'elderly', 'was', 'written', 'specifically', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'longer', 'possession', 'faculties', 'stories', 'characters', 'MSW', 'are', 'elemental', 'type', 'ideas', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'complex', 'thinking', 'why', 'Alzheimer', 'patients', 'are', 'able', 'understand', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'give', 'idea', 'elemental', 'type', 'things', 'make', 'up', 'MSW', 'episode', 'here', 'brief', 'list', 'recurring', 'ideas', 'might', 'come', 'up', 'average', 'episode', 'MSW', 'suspicious', 'looking', 'character', 'crime', 'was', 'committed', 'threat', 'was', 'made', 'lot', 'money', 'might', 'be', 'involved', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'rat', 'armed', 'dangerous', 'men/thugs', 'escape', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'murder', 'mystery', 'novels', 'arrest', 'made', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'trustworthy.The', 'creators', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'have', 'also', 'cleverly', 'created', 'situations', 'show', 'will', 'stroke', 'ego', 'elderly', 'person', 'making', 'elderly', 'person', 'feel', 'smart', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'studying', 'crime', 'scene', 're-creating', 'possible', 'crime', 'scenario', 'mind', 'exaggerated', 'slow', 'motion', 'style', 'pointing', 'gun', 'firing', 'just', 'bad', 'guy', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'So', 'word', 'being', 'spoken', 'JB', 'Fletcher', 'can', 'be', 'figured', 'out', 'elderly', 'viewer', 'Fletcher', 'trying', 're-create', 'crime', 'scenario', 'head', 'means', 'possibly', 'solving', 'case', 'may', 'seem', 'small', 'thing', 'anything', 'can', 'make', 'Alzheimer', 'patient', 'feel', 'smart', 'got', 'be', 'good', 'thing.Although', 'do', 'not', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'now', 'appreciate', 'role', 'can', 'play', 'life', 'elderly', 'person', 'television', 'art', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'pioneering', 'effort', 'area', 'Alzheimer', 'care.Update', 'had', ""n't"", 'watched', 'episodes', 'season', '5', 'when', 'wrote', 'above', 'review', 'watching', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'have', 'say', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'suitable', 'children', 'age', '18', 'least', '1', 'episodes', 'male', 'guest', 'star', 'offers', 'share', 'bed', 'JB', 'Fletcher', 'episode', 'Fletcher', 'up', 'bimbo', 'hangs', 'out', 'tavern', 'last', 'episode', 'watched', 'Fletcher', 'used', 'four-letter', 'cuss', 'word', 'MSW', 'not', 'as', 'wholesome', 'have', 'been', 'led', 'believe', 'fairness', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'elderly', 'not', 'children', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'put', 'kids', 'bed', 'pop', 'episode', 'Murder', 'Wrote']","Murder, She Wrote: The Complete Fifth Season"

Although Amos is sorely missed, Sheriff Metzger does grow on you and by the end of the season, I found that I quite liked him. His outburst in the second last episode is absolutely hilarious.

1034026,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B000KGH00C,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[2, 2]","Jessica Fletcher continues to solve more baffling crimes on the fifth season of ""Murder, She Wrote"". And while the fifth season is a good one, it's not as great as the first four seasons. For me most of the episodes come off as just good, not great. Though season five does provide a couple of great episodes, as well as a few episodes that I felt were a little dull. Still, the fifth season of ""Murder, She Wrote"" gets a thumbs up from me.Angela Lansbury once again is the whole show here, and gets good support from a few re-occurring co-stars as well as an impressive guest star list. William Windom returns for a couple of episodes as Cabot Cove doctor Seth Hazlitt, and Ron Masak joins the cast as new Cabot Cove sheriff Mort Metzger (replacing Amos Tupper). Season five guest stars include: Jamie Farr (""M*A*S*H""), Emma Samms (""General Hospital""), Hoyt Axton (""Gremlins""), Barbara Bain (""Mission Impossible""), Megan Mullally (""Will & Grace""), Barbara Bosson (""Hill Street Blues""), Richard Roundtree (""Shaft""), Bill Macy (""Maude""), Conchata Ferrell (""Two and a Half Men""), Mason Adams (""Lou Grant""), Shirley Knight (""As Good As It Gets""), Dee Wallace (""E.T.""), E.G. Marshall (""The Defenders""), Elizabeth Ashley (""Evening Shade""), Jerry Orbach (""Law & Order""), Robert Mandan (""Soap""), and Shelley Fabares (""Coach"").My favorite episodes from season five are: ""Mr. Penroy's Vacation"", ""Snow White, Blood Red"", ""Something Borrowed, Someone Blue"", ""Weave a Tangled Web"", ""From Russia...With Blood"", ""Trevor Hudson's Legacy"", ""Three Strikes, You're Out"", and ""Mirror, Mirror on the Wall"" (Parts 1 & 2).Even though the fifth season of ""Murder, She Wrote"" isn't in the same league as seasons one through four, it wasn't the start of a major decline in the greatness of the show.

I have faithfully followed all the seasons, and Season Five [1988-89] is as entertaining as ever. I have to say that though I love all the locations for the stories, my favorite is Cabot Cove, Maine and I just adore the quirky townspeople and the scandals around them!In Season Five, we have some noted guest stars such as Maxwell Caulfield, John Rhys-Davies, Emma Samms, Bo Svenson, Erin Gray, etc. With such talents abounding in each episode, its no wonder that watching this series is such a pleasure! The stories are creative and well-written, with a cohesive plotline and of course, stellar acting.Of course, the regulars are a hoot to watch as well! Angela Lansbury is flawless in her role as super sleuth J.B. Fletcher, and there are of course  William Windom as Dr Seth Hazlitt, Richard Paul as mayor Sam Booth, Jerry Orbach as PI Harry McGraw etc. Tom Bosley's role as Sheriff Amos Tupper is replaced by Ron Masak, playing Sheriff Mort Metzger. It doesn't take one too long to warm up to Sheriff Metzger as played by Ron Masak. He is the perfect foil to J.B. Fletcher, and I just love watching the comical expressions on his face as Jessica stumps him again and again on cases they work on together!Angela Lansbury s such a talented actress and continues to amaze till today [at 82!]. What I love most about her portrayal of J.B. Fletcher is that she plays a strong, intelligent, and attractive middle-aged lady [such roles are so scarce in Hollywood], and managed to entertain audiences for 12 years in her most-famous screen role! I hope the later seasons [9-12] will be made available on DVD soon!",5,"J.B.
