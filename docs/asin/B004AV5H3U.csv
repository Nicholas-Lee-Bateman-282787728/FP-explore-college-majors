1393987,A1LV6LMUHV3DNS,B004AV5H3U,"C. Bauer ""buccaneer""","[8, 14]","Like others reviewing this series I enjoyed the lead character and the lush Irish scenary.  The crime stories were well laid out.  However, I've given this series only one star for a simple but disturbing reason.  Warning this is also a spoiler alert.  Sometimes modern writers go too far.  I know we live a world of entertainment where the more shocking the popular.  One has only to look at the most successful series on HBO and Starz in the last five years for proof of that.  The more violence of every kind against people and animals, the more graphic and sensationalized the sex the greater the viewing audience.  I suspect the makers of this series felt it was time to up the proverbial bet.  And add incest into the mix.  Which they have done in this first series. Frankly I found no sense in adding this to the story.  And frankly the fact that incest occurred between the lead character and a young woman he had no idea was his half sister did not in any contribute to any of the stories.  Were we supposed to feel sorry for him?  For her?  For a country still living with deep and dark secrets like Ireland does?  It simply left this viewer with a slight case of nausea.  The HBO series ""Rome"" added incest as well to one of it's stories.  But in that case, it was a backdrop to a larger and more disturbing tale; to illustrate how one person driven by anger and revenge could manipulate a someone else who was trusting and rather nieve into doing what even in Ancient Rome was considered wrong.  It made sense as upsetting a scene as it was.  This made no sense.  Of course men father out of wedlock children all over the world.  Perhaps incest occurs on a fairly frequent basis.  But, perhaps it doesn't.  We don't have statistics on that as far as I know.  What we have in this first series is incest with no contribution to the story of this young man.  Years ago there was a film about a Sheriff in a small Texas border town.  The title escapes me.  Incest was a part of this story too.  But there again a backdrop to larger and far more troubling issues.  And unlike the writers of this series who I think did not know how to illustrate what someone might feel in this situation, in that film those writers handled the ""forbidden"" in a sensitive and compassionate manner.  The character in this series simply reacts by rejecting this young woman out of hand with no explanations while remaining silent even to himself.  Is that because these writers were not as familiar with this dilemma as they should have been.  But they knew by dropping incest into their story would bring viewers to their series like bees to honey.",1,Sometimes a series goes too far,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,2638,"['others', 'reviewing', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'lead', 'character', 'lush', 'Irish', 'scenary', 'crime', 'stories', 'were', 'well', 'laid', 'out', 'However', ""'ve"", 'given', 'series', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'simple', 'disturbing', 'reason', 'Warning', 'also', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'Sometimes', 'modern', 'writers', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'know', 'live', 'world', 'entertainment', 'where', 'more', 'shocking', 'popular', 'One', 'only', 'look', 'most', 'successful', 'series', 'HBO', 'Starz', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'proof', 'more', 'violence', 'kind', 'people', 'animals', 'more', 'graphic', 'sensationalized', 'sex', 'greater', 'viewing', 'audience', 'suspect', 'makers', 'series', 'felt', 'was', 'time', 'up', 'proverbial', 'bet', 'add', 'incest', 'mix', 'have', 'done', 'first', 'series', 'Frankly', 'found', 'sense', 'adding', 'story', 'fact', 'incest', 'occurred', 'lead', 'character', 'young', 'woman', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'half', 'sister', 'did', 'not', 'contribute', 'stories', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'country', 'still', 'living', 'deep', 'dark', 'secrets', 'Ireland', 'simply', 'left', 'viewer', 'slight', 'case', 'nausea', 'HBO', 'series', 'Rome', 'added', 'incest', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'stories', 'case', 'was', 'backdrop', 'larger', 'more', 'disturbing', 'tale', 'illustrate', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'driven', 'anger', 'revenge', 'could', 'manipulate', 'someone', 'else', 'who', 'was', 'trusting', 'rather', 'nieve', 'doing', 'what', 'even', 'Ancient', 'Rome', 'was', 'considered', 'wrong', 'made', 'sense', 'upsetting', 'scene', 'was', 'made', 'sense', 'course', 'men', 'father', 'wedlock', 'children', 'world', 'Perhaps', 'incest', 'occurs', 'fairly', 'frequent', 'basis', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'statistics', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'What', 'have', 'first', 'series', 'incest', 'contribution', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'ago', 'was', 'film', 'Sheriff', 'small', 'Texas', 'border', 'town', 'title', 'Incest', 'was', 'part', 'story', 'too', 'there', 'again', 'backdrop', 'larger', 'far', 'more', 'troubling', 'issues', 'writers', 'series', 'who', 'think', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'illustrate', 'what', 'someone', 'might', 'feel', 'situation', 'film', 'writers', 'handled', 'forbidden', 'sensitive', 'compassionate', 'manner', 'character', 'series', 'simply', 'rejecting', 'young', 'woman', 'hand', 'explanations', 'remaining', 'silent', 'even', 'writers', 'were', 'not', 'familiar', 'dilemma', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'knew', 'dropping', 'incest', 'story', 'would', 'bring', 'viewers', 'series', 'bees', 'honey']",Single Handed: Set One

1393994,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B004AV5H3U,FYI,"[14, 24]","Dolorous, unbelievable story lines. I was sincerely looking forward to viewing the evocative Irish landscape, even if the mysteries weren't great. But there isn't enough of Irish countryside to compensate for the atrocious stories and miserable acting. In all three episodes, the same mountains, artificially sepia-tinted (forget green), repeatedly show up in reused footage. The filming in the third mystery is so poor that innumerable, out-of-focus closeups of the cop's white vehicle glare in the viewer's eyes. Throughout, the impersonal homes are unbelievable as well, set within yards of one another in a cheap and depressing vacation rental park, or abandoned housing development. This adds a surreal quality. Ugly clich&eacute;s about unwanted babies, and a stupid relationship between the cop and a girl who is preposterously attracted to him and turns out to be his sister, are repellent. This is a cynical, sinister depiction of rural Ireland, replete with stereotypes. The farfetched plots seem derived from the 1950s, or ""Peyton Place.""

Grim, dull, affected, and a total waste of time and money.AlthoughHamish MacBeth: Series 1-3 Collectiondoesn't take place in the Republic of Ireland, but Scotland, the cinematography of gorgeous Celtic landscapes is honest (untinted).

1393998,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B004AV5H3U,Jack E. Levic,"[13, 18]","I was eager to see this police series set in a small town in Ireland. I have watched many British and American police shows so I looked forward to seeing an Irish version. I totally agree with other reviewers who said the main gem of SINGLE-HANDED is the beautiful green Irish countryside. The scenery is outstanding.  Much of filming is done outdoors so there is a visual feast of lovely Ireland. Saying that, I have to sadly say the other aspects of the series are rather dull and tedious. The stories have potential but the action is so slow-moving and the dialogue unmotivated.The real problem is the writing. Garda Sergeant Jack Driscoll has returned from Dublin to his small hometown on the west coast of Ireland. It is never really explained as to why he returns and how he happens to replace his father as the head of the two-man police department. Driscoll may be working in a small town but there are lots of secrets and the locals look after each other while the police look the other way. It seems like everyone in town is hiding some dark secret and here is where the stories begin to fade into oblivion. A few secrets are evetually revealed to be hidden away again, but in most cases thinks are left unresolved or not understood.Few, if any, of the major characters are likeable. Jack's father is under investigation for his unscrupulous handing of various arrests through the years. The townsfolk are tightlipped. There is so much potential in this series that is just wasted. In episode one, a beautiful illegal immigrant is found dead under mysterious circumstances. Jack Driscoll is determinded to find the truth. A potentially compelling story becomes a twist of confusion and a bit of farce. Driscoll questions Tommy and Tommy says Driscoll should be talking to his own father. Driscoll drives to his father and is told he should be asking Tommy questions. Anyway, the episode is a ping pong of back and forth questions. I actually wanted to keep track of how much of each show is dedicated to Driscoll driving back and forth from his parents to the police station to crime scenes and to interview witnesses. Back and forth over long stretches of country rode. I guess it is better to drive than use the phone.Even Jack's mother is ""mum"" about Jack's father and all she knows. People keep quiet in this town. It's also a bit uncertain as to how big or small this town is. Lots of people seem to live in the country but the town has a big hotel, new office building, meeting halls and the like, yet the police station does not even have a computer. The local pub has a rotary dial phone and Jack's mother has a cassette player. Of course, everyone has a cell phone. It's a small town, yet it seems to have the mob and organized crime bosses.I kept watching each episode even though they were incredibly slow moving. A couple big plot twists in the first episode are revealed and then hidden. The last episode was called ""THE DROWNING MAN"" and finally the writers seem to have more control over a storyline. It was still lacking but the added mystery of an unexplained drowning along with two suspicious tourists in town made more a more interesting story.Sadly, the characters are never fully developed. Driscoll doesn't have luck in relationships and has a different lady friend in each episode..not bad for a small town police sergeant. I expected so much more and was so disappointed.",3,BEAUTIFUL SCENERY BUT BORING SLOW MOVIE STORIES,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,3406,"['was', 'eager', 'see', 'police', 'series', 'set', 'small', 'town', 'Ireland', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'British', 'American', 'police', 'shows', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Irish', 'version', 'totally', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'main', 'gem', 'SINGLE-HANDED', 'beautiful', 'green', 'Irish', 'countryside', 'scenery', 'outstanding', 'Much', 'filming', 'done', 'outdoors', 'visual', 'feast', 'lovely', 'Ireland', 'Saying', 'have', 'sadly', 'say', 'other', 'aspects', 'series', 'are', 'rather', 'dull', 'tedious', 'stories', 'have', 'potential', 'action', 'so', 'slow-moving', 'dialogue', 'unmotivated.The', 'real', 'problem', 'writing', 'Garda', 'Sergeant', 'Jack', 'Driscoll', 'returned', 'Dublin', 'small', 'hometown', 'west', 'coast', 'Ireland', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'why', 'how', 'replace', 'father', 'head', 'two-man', 'police', 'department', 'Driscoll', 'may', 'be', 'working', 'small', 'town', 'are', 'lots', 'secrets', 'locals', 'look', 'other', 'police', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'everyone', 'town', 'hiding', 'dark', 'secret', 'here', 'where', 'stories', 'begin', 'fade', 'oblivion', 'few', 'secrets', 'are', 'evetually', 'revealed', 'be', 'hidden', 'away', 'again', 'most', 'cases', 'thinks', 'are', 'left', 'unresolved', 'not', 'understood.Few', 'major', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'Jack', 'father', 'investigation', 'unscrupulous', 'handing', 'various', 'arrests', 'years', 'townsfolk', 'are', 'tightlipped', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'series', 'just', 'wasted', 'episode', 'one', 'beautiful', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'found', 'dead', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'Jack', 'Driscoll', 'determinded', 'find', 'truth', 'potentially', 'compelling', 'story', 'twist', 'confusion', 'bit', 'farce', 'Driscoll', 'questions', 'Tommy', 'Tommy', 'Driscoll', 'should', 'be', 'talking', 'own', 'father', 'Driscoll', 'father', 'told', 'should', 'be', 'asking', 'Tommy', 'questions', 'Anyway', 'episode', 'ping', 'pong', 'back', 'forth', 'questions', 'actually', 'wanted', 'keep', 'track', 'how', 'much', 'show', 'dedicated', 'Driscoll', 'driving', 'back', 'forth', 'parents', 'police', 'station', 'crime', 'scenes', 'interview', 'witnesses', 'Back', 'forth', 'long', 'stretches', 'country', 'rode', 'guess', 'better', 'drive', 'use', 'phone.Even', 'Jack', 'mother', 'mum', 'Jack', 'father', 'People', 'keep', 'quiet', 'town', 'also', 'bit', 'uncertain', 'how', 'big', 'small', 'town', 'Lots', 'people', 'seem', 'live', 'country', 'town', 'big', 'hotel', 'new', 'office', 'building', 'meeting', 'halls', 'like', 'yet', 'police', 'station', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'computer', 'local', 'pub', 'rotary', 'dial', 'phone', 'Jack', 'mother', 'cassette', 'player', 'course', 'everyone', 'cell', 'phone', 'small', 'town', 'have', 'mob', 'organized', 'crime', 'bosses.I', 'kept', 'watching', 'episode', 'even', 'were', 'incredibly', 'slow', 'moving', 'couple', 'big', 'plot', 'twists', 'first', 'episode', 'are', 'revealed', 'then', 'hidden', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'called', 'THE', 'DROWNING', 'MAN', 'finally', 'writers', 'seem', 'have', 'more', 'control', 'storyline', 'was', 'still', 'lacking', 'added', 'mystery', 'unexplained', 'drowning', 'two', 'suspicious', 'tourists', 'town', 'made', 'more', 'more', 'interesting', 'story.Sadly', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'Driscoll', ""n't"", 'have', 'luck', 'relationships', 'different', 'lady', 'friend', 'episode..not', 'bad', 'small', 'town', 'police', 'sergeant', 'expected', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed']",Single Handed: Set One
