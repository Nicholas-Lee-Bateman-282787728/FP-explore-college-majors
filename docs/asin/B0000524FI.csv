Here we are shown tricks as how one may combat with the hard violin on one's shoulder; how to hold it best, and the bow too so that you can get a full and colourful sound etc etc...Remarks as weighty as general principles are abundant:  music is important to a civilized community; every note in the score has a meaning; the lines are more important than notes;  play the music as though you're composing it; there is life in music, not just notes;  there are so many ways of playing the same note-- here, express it as though you are saying something special to your lover; play it like how you would sing it; the violinis not important, it's just the means and the end is communication... There are equally abundant remarks and demonstrations on rhythm and phrasings along with other expressions in music, all invaluable to most music students and they are particularly targeted at the Chinese students.Furthermore, we have quite a few invaluable clips of top Chinese musicians, playing 20 years ago when they were small, and then 20 years later when they are matured/maturing, even in the eyes of the world class elites ...In a way, it's a short and concise history of modern China: there are some rare clips of China before and during the Japanese occupation, and some photos of at the turn of the century; and then how China looked like when she first opened up, including some of the most scenic parts of China like the mountains and landscapes in Kweilin and the bridges of Soo Zhou, parks and streets life and in Shanghai etc.  And eventually what she looks like now: full of skyscapers decorated with eye-catching neon lights...We also have Chinese performing arts of the HIGHEST ORDER: Chinese musical instruments; Peking opera (including the martial arts as seen on stage); Chinese acrobatics, gymnastics; ping pong players as how they are trained in their early ages; vaudeville ( in particular the minic of sounds of the engine of a train and then various birds etc) etc.These all juxtaposed with and hence giving depth to the training of young musicians of western music in their boarding school life who suffered so much during the Cultural Revolution where the musicians were treated like ""criminals"", or ""animals""...This DVD runs 140 min., but almost every frame is a joy from whatever point of view you see it, and wherever you're from, and whoever you are!",5,"The Connoisseur & The Indifferent Will Like It, East or West",1066435200,"10 18, 2003",2003,2749,"['Indeed', 'said', 'used', 'music', 'passport', 'go', 'China', 'not', 'concert', 'tour', 'how-do-you-do-trip', 'Maestro', 'musical', 'power', 'superb', 'linguistic', 'power', 'power', 'communication', 'also', 'superb.For', 'music', 'students', 'particularly', 'beginners', 'Maestro', 'remarks', 'followed', 'forceful', 'illustrative', 'demonstrations', 'are', 'just', 'invaluable', 'Here', 'are', 'shown', 'tricks', 'how', 'one', 'may', 'combat', 'hard', 'violin', 'one', 'shoulder', 'how', 'hold', 'best', 'bow', 'too', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'full', 'colourful', 'sound', 'etc', 'etc', 'Remarks', 'as', 'weighty', 'general', 'principles', 'are', 'abundant', 'music', 'important', 'civilized', 'community', 'note', 'score', 'meaning', 'lines', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'notes', 'play', 'music', ""'re"", 'composing', 'life', 'music', 'not', 'just', 'notes', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'playing', 'same', 'note', 'here', 'express', 'are', 'saying', 'something', 'special', 'lover', 'play', 'how', 'would', 'sing', 'violinis', 'not', 'important', 'just', 'means', 'end', 'communication', 'are', 'equally', 'abundant', 'remarks', 'demonstrations', 'rhythm', 'phrasings', 'other', 'expressions', 'music', 'invaluable', 'most', 'music', 'students', 'are', 'particularly', 'targeted', 'Chinese', 'students.Furthermore', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'invaluable', 'clips', 'top', 'Chinese', 'musicians', 'playing', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'were', 'small', 'then', '20', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'are', 'matured/maturing', 'even', 'eyes', 'world', 'class', 'elites', 'way', 'short', 'concise', 'history', 'modern', 'China', 'are', 'rare', 'clips', 'China', 'Japanese', 'occupation', 'photos', 'turn', 'century', 'then', 'how', 'China', 'looked', 'when', 'first', 'opened', 'up', 'including', 'most', 'scenic', 'parts', 'China', 'mountains', 'landscapes', 'Kweilin', 'bridges', 'Soo', 'Zhou', 'parks', 'streets', 'life', 'Shanghai', 'etc', 'eventually', 'what', 'now', 'full', 'skyscapers', 'decorated', 'eye-catching', 'neon', 'lights', 'also', 'have', 'Chinese', 'performing', 'arts', 'HIGHEST', 'ORDER', 'Chinese', 'musical', 'instruments', 'Peking', 'opera', 'including', 'martial', 'arts', 'seen', 'stage', 'Chinese', 'acrobatics', 'gymnastics', 'ping', 'pong', 'players', 'how', 'are', 'trained', 'early', 'ages', 'vaudeville', 'particular', 'minic', 'sounds', 'engine', 'train', 'then', 'various', 'birds', 'etc', 'etc.These', 'juxtaposed', 'hence', 'giving', 'depth', 'training', 'young', 'musicians', 'western', 'music', 'boarding', 'school', 'life', 'who', 'suffered', 'so', 'much', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'where', 'musicians', 'were', 'treated', 'criminals', 'animals', 'DVD', '140', 'min.', 'almost', 'frame', 'joy', 'point', 'view', 'see', ""'re"", 'are']",N/A
564798,A33H0WC9MI8OVW,B0000524FI,Clare Chu,"[4, 4]","Developing the hearts and souls to musical involvement and passion, Isaac Stern meets and plays violin with musicians and gives performances as he tours China.  He finds great technical ability, but a lack of understanding.  He teaches that there is more to music than just playing the notes, but rather making the notes and lines say something, that words cannot express.  As they say in the film, to know the taste of a pear, you must eat it, you cannot study it.  So it is with music, you must play it, experience it, feel it.  You cannot just study it, but you must be involved intimately.  He teaches that the violin is a part of your body, and use the violin to sing as you would sing with your voice.  One little girl was told to sing a phrase she had been playing in.  After she sang it she was able to play it again with the feeling she had when she sang.  Another woman was given demonstrations of phrasing and dancing in the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso.  She had great technical ability to play fast, but played just notes, missing the flirtaciousness of a dance.  Isaac demonstrates it and even does a big of a jig to show her how it works.The sequel (20 years later) was heartwarming.  Beijing had transformed herself into a modern metropolis.  We meet some of the students and the conductor that had worked with Isaac 20 years ago.  It was a heartwarming reunion.Special attention to luthiers.  There is a documentary of Shanghai luthier Tan Shu-chen and his life story (in the Extras), his love for violin, his love of music, and his Christian family background.  He was the first Chinese to play in a foreign symphony orchestra.  It also goes through the history of 20th century China.  There is an incident where the violinists were told to go play for the Japanese officers.  Tan refused to play for them and resigned his job.  Also interesting postwar history, how he made it through the war, how he stayed in China after 1949, and how he turned to making violins after becoming director of the Shanghai conservatory with lack of instruments.  He started a small factory, making violins to give to the students free of charge.  He was denounced by a student and his house raided in the Cultural Revolution and imprisoned in a closet in a basement under the stairs and kept away from his violins for more than a year, made to repair toilets, taking care of 122 toilets and taken out for beatings and tortures by the Red Guards.  They poured boiling water into one of the musician's ear deafening him.  17 musicians committed suicide under the harsh treatment and humiliation.  He never thought of suicide because he is a Christian.  He just waited and the sun came out eventually.  Later he was cleared and reinstated in the Shanghai Conservatory.  Later he saw the Red Guard who was convicted for 8 years of prison, and then later worked again in the conservatory kitchen.  He said that if the Guard would talk to him, he would forgive him, and let bygones be bygones.  Forgiveness gives him peace of mind.  It is so wonderful to know that his faith in Jesus Christ has kept him sane and prospering while in such circumstances.  He can now make and play the violins that he so loves.

It was a very refreshing reconnection with a phenominal musician and teacher.  I liked the way he worked with the Chinese musicians - having one violinist sing the music and then played like she sang was, to me, inspired but to Stern probably seemed eminently logical in order to help the musician gain a better understanding of the work in front of her.  It is an interesting look at a China that is rapidly disappearing - as the market economy roars ahead less of the old China will remain.  It is also (1980) just after the cultural revolution and here Stern surprises me - he asks where are the young musicians and seems to not realize that a generation of musicians were being ""re-educated"".  I was a little surprised by his question - I would have thought the answer was self-evident.  The return trip to a much different Beijing was equally impressive.  It was great to see the evolution of the young musicians - one a musician in the Hong Kong Symphony, others doing well in their own fields and yes the singing violinist is seen again.  In all, this is a delightful and very interesting musical documentary.  What was a surprise to me was that although I knew Stern had died I was surprised to learn that David Golub had also died - before Stern.  This might be considered a fitting tribute to both men for them to bridge the gap (at that time) between China and the rest of the world.

Now I've just come home from work, have bought my own copy at Amazon, and am posting this review.The film will please you if you're a fan of classical music or have an interest in the Orient, especially China. In my case, both.Had I seen this documentary in 1980, when it first came out, I'd today be a wealthy man. I know I'm a rich man, having a great wife, wonderful children and good health. But I'd also have money in the bank, because I'd have seen back then how industrious, skilled, and intelligent the Chinese are, and would have invested everything I had in that country. It's no secret they're eating our lunch; I now better see how and why. I also now better understand where Amy Chua, the Tiger Mom, is coming from.Those of us old enough to remember China's Cultural Revolution never expected the country to recover in our lifetimes from that man-made disaster. Yet it took less than a generation. Seeing the bright faces and amazing talent in the young people in this film makes me see why, and makes me almost weep for my own country as I picture so many of our own apathetic, self-indulgent, undisciplined youth.Aside from the music, the disc has bonus features that are as engrossing as the film itself. One has Isaac Stern returning to China 20 years later and meeting some of the young musicians he taught back then. Just as the children have grown to adults, more remarkable is how Shanghai grew to be the modern metropolis it is today.Another feature is on Dr Tan, a hero of our times. This is worth the price of the disc all by itself.There's also a visit by Stern to the Beijing Opera (I think) where four young men and a young woman performed the most amazing feat of gymnastics I may ever have seen.Can't praise this documentary enough.
