With Vincent & Catherine, the Beast rescues Beauty to save her life & with the passage of time develops from friendship into genuine love to the point that a child was born that any human being can ask for in a lifetime.

1169395,A3HJTOCROCTMQF,B001AZIRZO,"Debrah A. Ross ""Upcoming author""","[1, 1]","I have wanted the entire series of Beauty and the Beast for ages. This Christmas, I bought it for myself. I'm old enough to have seen it when it was on TV, and immediately fell in love with it. Like any show, there are some episodes that aren't that interesting, but most are phenomenal. I don't know if this was Ron Perlman's first time in a role requiring such a physical change,but his still being able to act and create the unique voice for ""Vincent""was outstanding work. Linda Hamilton was a good choice for Catherine, because she wasn't just another pretty face. The character she created had a gentleness, and fierceness when needed especially over Vincent. I loved watching their friendship slowly change into romantic love. The ""Beast"" was supposed to be frightening, but I would say only startling at first glance. I always thought Vincent was incredibly sexy. Truly my favorite show.From a nearly three season run (a 3rd season had begun, but had only three episodes before cancellation), there were only two that I hadn't taped. Yes, back in the days when the ""VCR"" was still relatively new, I taped the series. You could do that back then, but not invite a houseful of people over and charge admission. However, 25 year-old VHS tapes don't hold a candle to modern DVD's. Actually, it was a total of 5 episodes, because back then, I didn't know that there was a Season 3, with a few episodes. There had been no advertising, and it wasn't shown until months later. Now, I finally got to see them. Although the show has long ended, a new generation might be able to enjoy the series. What's interesting is there are websites all over, with former viewers keeping the show going, mostly the love between Catherine and Vincent, by writing countless short stories. I think this series can teach people how to love the person inside, and not cast them away for their exterior.",5,A Television Show for the Heart.,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,1882,"['have', 'wanted', 'entire', 'series', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'ages', 'Christmas', 'bought', ""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'immediately', 'fell', 'love', 'show', 'are', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'most', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'first', 'time', 'role', 'requiring', 'physical', 'change', 'still', 'being', 'able', 'act', 'create', 'unique', 'voice', 'Vincent', 'was', 'outstanding', 'work', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'Catherine', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'character', 'created', 'had', 'gentleness', 'fierceness', 'when', 'needed', 'especially', 'Vincent', 'loved', 'watching', 'friendship', 'slowly', 'change', 'romantic', 'love', 'Beast', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'frightening', 'would', 'say', 'only', 'startling', 'first', 'glance', 'always', 'thought', 'Vincent', 'was', 'incredibly', 'sexy', 'Truly', 'favorite', 'show.From', 'nearly', 'three', 'season', 'run', '3rd', 'season', 'had', 'begun', 'had', 'only', 'three', 'episodes', 'cancellation', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'had', ""n't"", 'taped', 'Yes', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'VCR', 'was', 'still', 'relatively', 'new', 'taped', 'series', 'could', 'do', 'back', 'then', 'not', 'invite', 'houseful', 'people', 'charge', 'admission', 'However', '25', 'year-old', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'modern', 'DVD', 'Actually', 'was', 'total', '5', 'episodes', 'back', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Season', '3', 'few', 'episodes', 'had', 'been', 'no', 'advertising', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'months', 'later', 'Now', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'show', 'long', 'ended', 'new', 'generation', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'series', 'What', 'interesting', 'are', 'former', 'viewers', 'keeping', 'show', 'going', 'mostly', 'love', 'Catherine', 'Vincent', 'writing', 'countless', 'short', 'stories', 'think', 'series', 'can', 'teach', 'people', 'how', 'love', 'person', 'not', 'cast', 'away', 'exterior']",Beauty and the Beast - The Complete Series

1169398,A36H16ZJXUIMZG,B001AZIRZO,"Gene Cisco ""Moon Man""","[0, 0]","I remember catching this series by accident in the 80's when other series (The Equalizer for one) were returning to New York for location shooting, probably in the second season, and I fell under its spell. To me, it wasn't about The Beast (Ron Perlman) or The Beauty (Linda Hamilton)so much as the working out of the romantic/contemplative life versus the ordinary/business life. And, to me, the writers had it worked out that this country was heading for a bumpy ride promoting the notion that you could ""have it all."" Catherine,(lawyer Linda Hamilton) has everyday problems above ground always solved by going below ground, of course, with her soul-mate, Vincent. In the course of the episodes they both learn from one another. In no time I looked forward to going beneath the city to the lair/library of those living the contemplative ""underground"" life. There was a wonderful build-up to earn your peek into this underground world. And what this series says about the advantages of reading alone, solitude as opposed to loneliness, leading to self-assurance, self-esteem etc. must have influenced many other devotees. The series also emphasized the voice and elocution in a very subtle way. When you think about it, this series anticipated libraries facing extinction, at least to the outside (above ground) city. The voice of Ron Perlman and the art direction are essential to the credibility of this fable, held together with the paternal wisdom of Vincent's ""Father"" Roy Dotrice. I was disappointed in the last season where I think they went wrong story-wise, but the series hits it on the nail bringing literature, philosophy (Emersonian or others)alive beneath the troubled city and in the hearts of Vincent and Catherine, if only our politicians were so inspired.",4,The Beauty is Below and The Beast is Above,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,1774,"['remember', 'catching', 'series', 'accident', '80', 'when', 'other', 'series', 'Equalizer', 'one', 'were', 'returning', 'New', 'York', 'location', 'shooting', 'probably', 'second', 'season', 'fell', 'spell', 'was', ""n't"", 'Beast', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'Beauty', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'so', 'much', 'working', 'romantic/contemplative', 'life', 'ordinary/business', 'life', 'writers', 'had', 'worked', 'out', 'country', 'was', 'heading', 'bumpy', 'ride', 'promoting', 'notion', 'could', 'have', 'Catherine', 'lawyer', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'everyday', 'problems', 'ground', 'always', 'solved', 'going', 'ground', 'course', 'soul-mate', 'Vincent', 'course', 'episodes', 'learn', 'one', 'time', 'looked', 'forward', 'going', 'city', 'lair/library', 'living', 'contemplative', 'underground', 'life', 'was', 'wonderful', 'build-up', 'earn', 'peek', 'underground', 'world', 'what', 'series', 'advantages', 'reading', 'alone', 'solitude', 'opposed', 'loneliness', 'leading', 'self-assurance', 'self-esteem', 'etc', 'must', 'have', 'influenced', 'many', 'other', 'devotees', 'series', 'also', 'emphasized', 'voice', 'elocution', 'very', 'subtle', 'way', 'When', 'think', 'series', 'anticipated', 'libraries', 'facing', 'extinction', 'least', 'outside', 'ground', 'city', 'voice', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'art', 'direction', 'are', 'essential', 'credibility', 'fable', 'held', 'together', 'paternal', 'wisdom', 'Vincent', 'Father', 'Roy', 'Dotrice', 'was', 'disappointed', 'last', 'season', 'where', 'think', 'went', 'wrong', 'story-wise', 'series', 'nail', 'bringing', 'literature', 'philosophy', 'Emersonian', 'others', 'alive', 'troubled', 'city', 'hearts', 'Vincent', 'Catherine', 'only', 'politicians', 'were', 'so', 'inspired']",Beauty and the Beast - The Complete Series

1169409,A1CDJ52UT65XGE,B001AZIRZO,Lil MC,"[4, 4]","I want to start by saying what a HUGE fan I am of this show. I used to watch this show religiously every week when I was in elementary school.  Looking back, I am surprised it did not frighten me.  Seeing Vincent angry could send chills down a person's spine pretty easily.  I fell in love with this show when I was little. The beautiful love between Vincent and Catherine.I never got to buy individual seasons of this show because the retailers where I live couldn't keep them in stock long enough.  When I found the complete series set, I was elated, to say the very least.  The price is fantastic.I personally love the look of the packaging.  I was suprised to see how the individual seasons are presented in the box.  I assumed they would appear in the same manner in which they were sold originally.  They are not.The only major complaint I have is that Season One is the only season with a play all feature.  I prefer having the play all feature on a dvd box set for a television series.  It saves me from having to fiddle with my remote.At any rate, this won't stop you from enjoying this show, if you were a fan in the 80's, and falling in love with it all over again.  If you are a newcomer to the show, you will find something for everyone in this fantastic series.  Lovers of romance will find storylines to accomodate them.  People who love mystery and intrigue will find something to accomodate them as well.  Action seekers will also be accomodated by this show.I give this series 5 stars not just for the memories it gave me, or the lessons it taught me about love, but also for what it represents which is finding beauty in a world where it seems impossible to find.I also have to mention my favorite quote from the show.  Once you read it, you will know why this show endures so much with fans.  ""Though lovers be lost, love shall not, and death shall have no dominion.""  In season three, they put lyrics to the theme song during a montage.  It said ""The first time I loved forever was when you whispered my name and I knew at once you loved me.""  I don't remember the rest.For anyone who hasn't seen the show, I do not wish to spoil it. So I will say that as a child I was not real keen on Season 3 because of a tragic event that takes place.  It ripped my heart right out.  The show is still a brilliant, well written, well produced, well acted series.If you want to watch a series that will give you a piece of ""once upon a time"" in your modern life, you should definitely buy ""Beauty and the Beast"" - The Complete Series.  This show endures with the same beauty and heart that it had when it premiered 24 years ago.  The phrase ""they don't make shows like this anymore"" is completely true with regard to ""Beauty and the Beast"".

Many fans do not realize there were letters from the tv show.On the bonus disc, there are 4 items you can click on in the Main menu.The 2nd one is ""Original Love Letters"" and the 3rd are the ""Newly Reconstructed Love letters""The original love letters are ""READ"" by Vincent; make no mistake about it.  Though they could have done a better job of re-mastering them. At times, they sound almost pieced together...perhaps the originals were damaged and they did their best to re-assemble them - but it is Vincent's voice. You will see Vincent writing the letters and the words scroll across the screen as Vincent reads them.  They are some of the best love letters you will ever read or listen to.  There are only 4 original love letters.The ""Newly Reconstructed love letters"" is some actor reading them (not Vincent) and there is no scrolling of the letters like there is in the original love letters. Why the powers that be used an actor to read Vincent's love letters is stupid and unforgivable, but don't let it detour from buying the dvds. There are 7 love letters here. I personally won't bother listening to the ""Newly Reconstructed love letters"".  If they had scrolled the words, it would've been worth listening to.My point on this review is there are letters that Vincent reads.  A lot of reviewers are upset that there is not.

MGM took the lead with the new Alfred Hitchcock Premiere Collection packaging where all the discs were stuck unprotected into cardboard slats but CBS/Paramount has caught up and perhaps surpassed MGM with its new Beauty and the Beast Complete Series packaging. Props CBS.Like the MGM Hitchcock set, the Beauty and the Beast set comes poorly packed. In this case the discs are housed in accordion like cardboard and are simply stuck unprotected into cardboard slats (MGM and CBS have apparently never heard of archival quality polyprop sleeves). Can you say scratched discs? Well I can and so can this package. It is a pity that CBS simply didn't package the wonderful slimline packages they put the individual seasons in together but hey this is CBS the same company that savaged ""Holocaust"" by transferring it horribly and by cutting it.As to the show itself, it's not bad though I think it is overrated by its fans. Is it Due South? No. Is it Buffy? No. Is it Firefly? No. Is it Lost? No. What it is is a good series with intelligence, imagination, and heart. Personally I prefer those episodes that flesh out the underground world. One word suffices for the transfer: mediocre. But again this is CBS.Some final words: Why do I even bother to buy anything from this we don't put much effort into our DVDs because gullible consumers will buy them anyway company?

Someone had complained that the picture of the Beast on the box was not original, but I saw a view of the Beast in one of the shows, and it looked just like the picture on the box. All in all, we were very satisfied with our purchase. AND, the price was right as well.",5,Beauty and the Beast - The complete series,1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,454,"['set', 'came', 'very', 'promptly', 'advertised', 'came', 'beautifully', 'boxed', 'set', 'series', 'nicely', 'bound', 'portfolio', 'are', 'second', 'set', 'found', 'audio', 'video', 'great', 'Someone', 'had', 'complained', 'picture', 'Beast', 'box', 'was', 'not', 'original', 'saw', 'view', 'Beast', 'one', 'shows', 'looked', 'just', 'picture', 'box', 'were', 'very', 'satisfied', 'purchase', 'price', 'was', 'right', 'as', 'well']",Beauty and the Beast - The Complete Series
