728769,A2EOFYRFB292KS,B00007GZR3,"Alberto M. Barral ""NY LuxViewer""","[3, 8]","This movie is so bad, it's good. As a matter of fact, it is collectible! You will enjoy seeing two of the sexiest, hotest, most attractive people on earth move around each other as if they were furniture pieces from different sets, with absolutely no sensuality, or attraction of any type whatsoever, as a matter of fact, when Brando finally grabs Sophia for a kiss I thought he was going to slap her.Sophia looks gorgeous in every scene and outfit, which includes two different sets of Brando pajamas, one of which comes in an unusually strident shade of yellow that is particularly hideous. Her hair is perfect, eventhough she is staying in this cabin with nothing of her own as she arrived wearing an evening gown and a small purse that could fit a lipstick, maybe two. Yet in every scene she looks as if she had walked out of Alexandre de Paris' salon for a blow and dry. Noticing the capricious falling of her curls or the twist of her hair endings was my pastime in this movie that has one of the worst scripts ever written.  She acts her part as a Russian Countess fallen on bad times in the Orient very nicely, there is an iceness to her character that she conveys quite well. At her staged wedding with Brando's valet, which she has to go through to get entry into the US, she looks amazing in a pale green dress that is five times bigger than her size, but she manages to wrap it in a knot at the waist front , folding the long sleeves chinese style for a few minutes in which she makes you believe this is haute couture. When Sophia dives from the ship to her freedom she is wearing a perfectly tropical-patterned bathing suit and, yes, her hair dries out PERFECTLY in place, as if a hair-dressing angel was doing it for her.The furniture and sets in this film are the epitome of bad taste. Everything looks cheap, including the wood paneling in the boat's 'lavish' suite' where most of the action takes place. The pale-lavender sofas of the suite can only be imagined in the context of a provincial funeral parlor. The mustard coloring of the ballroom of the ship and the unfortunate costumes in most of the first class passengers can only be described as painful. Warning: The latticed work in most of the wall spaces in this film, as well as ""tropical"" rattan cheap-furniture can induce vomiting if you have not been frequently exposed to suburbian furniture.Brando was exasperated with his character, as he always looks bored and on edge. His pale-coral-rose lipstick and bronze makeup really show up in high definition and it looks funny. His clothes are particularly unattractive, except for his tux, yet he always looks great. Tippi Hedren plays Brando's wife Martha, and we could see here an early prototype for Albee's Virginia Wolf: A spoilt, unhappy, bitter and consistently annoying privileged creature who comes into the picture with two closets of luggage and a french maid that looks more like a lesbian companion or top model in between jobs, as a matter of fact her name in the credits is simply ""Balbina"" so she was a model or a well known courtesan. Tippi enjoys her role and plays it to the hilt, making a strong case for the failure of marriage in modern bourgeois society, her brief dialogue concentrates on denigrating Sophia's character, her husband, or both. Her presence is consistently bitchy and in seconds one can understand why her marriage is on the rocks, though it probably already started there. She does come out at one point with an exquisite Indian silk gown with gold patterns to match her conversation about Saudi Arabia which marks her only redeeming contributionIt was a schock for me to discover that Charles Chaplin was the director, as I thought this was the definitive bad Holywood movie, but then again, doesn't this depth of things wrong point to greatness?? The theme song, composed by Chaplin, which I loved, and later discovered was a GREAT hit, is also a reason to watch this movie, over and over.",5,Incredible Document of Bad Casting,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,3959,"['movie', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'matter', 'fact', 'collectible', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'two', 'sexiest', 'hotest', 'most', 'attractive', 'people', 'earth', 'move', 'other', 'were', 'furniture', 'pieces', 'different', 'sets', 'absolutely', 'sensuality', 'attraction', 'type', 'whatsoever', 'matter', 'fact', 'when', 'Brando', 'finally', 'Sophia', 'kiss', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'slap', 'her.Sophia', 'looks', 'gorgeous', 'scene', 'outfit', 'two', 'different', 'sets', 'Brando', 'pajamas', 'one', 'unusually', 'strident', 'shade', 'yellow', 'particularly', 'hideous', 'hair', 'perfect', 'staying', 'cabin', 'nothing', 'own', 'arrived', 'wearing', 'evening', 'gown', 'small', 'purse', 'could', 'fit', 'lipstick', 'maybe', 'two', 'scene', 'had', 'walked', 'Alexandre', 'de', 'Paris', 'salon', 'blow', 'dry', 'Noticing', 'capricious', 'falling', 'curls', 'twist', 'hair', 'endings', 'was', 'pastime', 'movie', 'one', 'worst', 'scripts', 'ever', 'written', 'part', 'Russian', 'Countess', 'fallen', 'bad', 'times', 'Orient', 'very', 'nicely', 'iceness', 'character', 'quite', 'well', 'staged', 'wedding', 'Brando', 'valet', 'go', 'get', 'entry', 'US', 'amazing', 'pale', 'green', 'dress', 'five', 'times', 'bigger', 'size', 'wrap', 'knot', 'waist', 'front', 'folding', 'long', 'sleeves', 'chinese', 'style', 'few', 'minutes', 'believe', 'haute', 'couture', 'When', 'Sophia', 'ship', 'freedom', 'wearing', 'perfectly', 'tropical-patterned', 'bathing', 'suit', 'yes', 'hair', 'out', 'PERFECTLY', 'place', 'hair-dressing', 'angel', 'was', 'doing', 'her.The', 'furniture', 'sets', 'film', 'are', 'epitome', 'bad', 'taste', 'Everything', 'cheap', 'including', 'wood', 'paneling', 'boat', ""'lavish"", 'suite', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'place', 'pale-lavender', 'sofas', 'suite', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'imagined', 'context', 'provincial', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'mustard', 'coloring', 'ballroom', 'ship', 'unfortunate', 'costumes', 'most', 'first', 'class', 'passengers', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'painful', 'Warning', 'latticed', 'work', 'most', 'wall', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'tropical', 'rattan', 'cheap-furniture', 'can', 'induce', 'vomiting', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'frequently', 'exposed', 'suburbian', 'furniture.Brando', 'was', 'exasperated', 'character', 'always', 'bored', 'edge', 'pale-coral-rose', 'lipstick', 'bronze', 'makeup', 'really', 'show', 'up', 'high', 'definition', 'funny', 'clothes', 'are', 'particularly', 'unattractive', 'tux', 'yet', 'always', 'great', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'Brando', 'wife', 'Martha', 'could', 'see', 'here', 'early', 'prototype', 'Albee', 'Virginia', 'Wolf', 'spoilt', 'unhappy', 'bitter', 'consistently', 'annoying', 'privileged', 'creature', 'who', 'picture', 'two', 'closets', 'luggage', 'french', 'maid', 'more', 'lesbian', 'companion', 'top', 'model', 'jobs', 'matter', 'fact', 'name', 'credits', 'simply', 'Balbina', 'was', 'model', 'well', 'known', 'courtesan', 'Tippi', 'role', 'hilt', 'making', 'strong', 'case', 'failure', 'marriage', 'modern', 'bourgeois', 'society', 'brief', 'dialogue', 'concentrates', 'denigrating', 'Sophia', 'character', 'husband', 'presence', 'consistently', 'bitchy', 'seconds', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'marriage', 'rocks', 'probably', 'already', 'started', 'there', 'come', 'out', 'one', 'point', 'exquisite', 'Indian', 'silk', 'gown', 'gold', 'patterns', 'match', 'conversation', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'only', 'redeeming', 'contributionIt', 'was', 'schock', 'discover', 'Charles', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'director', 'thought', 'was', 'definitive', 'bad', 'Holywood', 'movie', 'then', 'again', ""n't"", 'depth', 'things', 'wrong', 'point', 'greatness', 'theme', 'song', 'composed', 'Chaplin', 'loved', 'later', 'discovered', 'was', 'GREAT', 'hit', 'also', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie']",A Countess From Hong Kong
728770,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00007GZR3,Austin Somlo,"[1, 4]","Viewed: 11/06Rate: 511/06: A Countess From Hong Kong is an okay film directed by Charlie Chaplin. It seems that the movie had been distributed with Charlie Chaplin's name as the centerpiece of the picture like as if it was a big marketing thing to do. But actually, A Countess From Hong Kong interested me because Marlon Brando is in it, and that's all there is to it. Sophia Loren couldn't act worth a damn in A Countess From Hong Kong, and everybody else did, more or less, fine. I thought Marlon Brando handled his role very nicely, but I felt like he was trapped by the idea of how Charlie Chaplin thought everybody should act like. The sad thing about the idea he won't ever let go of is that nobody acts or performs like that in the real world. There was a lot of forceful acting and some dumb, embarrassing scenes. I wish that the picture would drop that brand of acting and be serious because really, it was working so well when it was serious, given the story was very intriguing. But in the end, it came with a mixed bag of results. A Countess From Hong Kong would have been a better picture if Sophia Loren would drop the wooden acting and Charlie Chaplin to ease up on his control and let everybody be themselves. Not much of a comedy, A Countess From Hong Kong is a mildly amusing picture.",3,Charlie Chaplin Was Really a SADIST!,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,1302,"['Viewed', '11/06Rate', '511/06', 'Countess', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'okay', 'film', 'directed', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'distributed', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'name', 'centerpiece', 'picture', 'was', 'big', 'marketing', 'thing', 'do', 'actually', 'A', 'Countess', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'interested', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'damn', 'A', 'Countess', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'everybody', 'else', 'did', 'more', 'less', 'fine', 'thought', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'handled', 'role', 'very', 'nicely', 'felt', 'was', 'trapped', 'idea', 'how', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'thought', 'everybody', 'should', 'act', 'sad', 'thing', 'idea', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'let', 'go', 'nobody', 'performs', 'real', 'world', 'was', 'lot', 'forceful', 'acting', 'dumb', 'embarrassing', 'scenes', 'wish', 'picture', 'would', 'drop', 'brand', 'acting', 'be', 'serious', 'really', 'was', 'working', 'so', 'well', 'when', 'was', 'serious', 'given', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'intriguing', 'end', 'came', 'mixed', 'bag', 'results', 'Countess', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'picture', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'would', 'drop', 'wooden', 'acting', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'ease', 'up', 'control', 'let', 'everybody', 'be', 'Not', 'much', 'comedy', 'A', 'Countess', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'picture']",A Countess From Hong Kong

728772,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00007GZR3,Byron Kolln,"[15, 17]","A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG was director/comedian Charlie Chaplin's final film.  In this film he is the director, writer and composer.The story concerns a beguiling Russian countess named Natascha (Sophia Loren - HOUSEBOAT), a young woman forced into prostitution in Hong Kong, when she happens to meet an American politician named Ogden Mears (Marlon Brando - A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, SUPERMAN).  She stows away in his stateroom aboard a ship headed back to the States, where she belives she can escape her miserable life.The usual battle-of-the-sexes ensues, when Natascha and Ogden are forced to spend the entire voyage together, bickering and fighting over their different opinions and tastes.  But its soon evident that they are in love.  Things become complicated when Ogden's icy wife (Tippi Hedren - THE BIRDS, MARNIE) joins the ship at Hawaii, while Natascha finds herself marrying Ogden's valet in order to gain an American passport!This is a film that feels a little old-fashioned for the 1960s, but it is a rather charming and engaging romantic comedy.  Perhaps the film is best-known for launching the hit single ""(Love) This is My Song"", made famous by Petula Clark.  The movie also stars Sydney Chaplin, Patrick Cargill and Margaret Rutherford in a rather-clever cameo.The DVD includes the trailer.

The film is an outdated romantic farce about how a son of a succesful tycoon(Marlon Brando) finds a beautiful stowaway in the form of Sophia Loren, who he met in China and now finds aboard a ship with him. A romance develops, though you won't believe it. Obviously, both actors are excellent but are VERY miscast and add to the discomfort of viewing the picture as a whole.Brando cannot seem to capture the nuances of romantic/screwball comedy and is totally out of league in a role clearly intended for a Cary Grant, David Niven or even a Rock Hudson. His character comes across as cold and unfunny throughout and never gains audience sympathy.Loren looks gorgeous, like usual,but seems out of place in the role of the naive Countess. She does have a nice scene in a sarong, but that's about all that could be reccomended from her in this picture.Charlie makes a cameo appearance as a steward, but it is too little and not enough.

Barry,"[9, 13]","Chaplin's final film is alternately a beautiful and meditative love story, and an old-fashioned (in the worst sense of the word) film that shows the limits of its director's abilities.The lead performances depend on the direction that Chaplin was able to provide. In some scenes, Brando manages to mimic Chaplin perfectly, and it works. In other scenes, he still mimics Chaplin, but the result is less effective. (As a devout Method actor, Brando repeatedly clashed with Chaplin, whose directorial style consisted of having the actors mimic his movements and delivery exactly). Sophia Loren is well-cast as the former Russian countess-turned-dance hall girl who stows away with the newly-appointed ambassador to Saudi Arabia (Brando). Aside from a major error in Chaplin's script (that is, that Loren's character is supposed to have left Russia in the revolution of 1917, which would make her character quite a bit older than she is), Loren plays the role with a comic grace that is both captivating and charming. The supporting cast have their moments: Sydney Chaplin as Brando's friend and advisor, Tippi Hedren as his estranged wife, Margaret Rutherford, in a delightful cameo as an elderly passenger aboard the ocean liner, and in a particularly memorable standout performance, Patrick Cargill as Brando's valet. Cargill shows a gift for comic timing and understated delivery here that makes the viewer wish he had been given more opportunities to demonstrate his talent. He nearly walks away with every scene he's in, and remains perhaps the most memorable part of the film.Chaplin's use of color and widescreen is appropriately understated in keeping with his style. However, it is in Chaplin's direction that we begin to see the limits of his filmmaking ability, at least in his later works. The cinematography is appropriately understated; however, it is in the editing that the pace of the film begins to bog down. Scenes requiring a frantic pace are edited entirely too slow, losing much of the comic rhythm between the performers. Many scenes are played out in single, long takes, without much interaction between the performers within the frame (they instead appear to have been instructed to stay ""on their mark"" and deliver their dialog).Perhaps the film's most memorable aspect is its lush orchestral score composed by Chaplin, and featuring the great ""This is My Song"", which re-appears throughout the film. Chaplin's abilities as a composer at this point had perhaps outmeasured his abilities as a filmmaker, and-fortunately for future audiences-he spent the next decade composing scores to his silent features of the 1920s.Universal's DVD of ""A Countess from Hong Kong"" is an excellent transfer in anamorphic widescreen. The colors are rich and the image sharp. It boasts a clear mono soundtrack, and features a trailer as an extra.",2,Chaplin's Last and Possibly Least,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,2850,"['Chaplin', 'final', 'film', 'alternately', 'beautiful', 'meditative', 'love', 'story', 'old-fashioned', 'worst', 'sense', 'word', 'film', 'limits', 'director', 'abilities.The', 'lead', 'performances', 'depend', 'direction', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'able', 'provide', 'scenes', 'Brando', 'mimic', 'Chaplin', 'perfectly', 'other', 'scenes', 'still', 'Chaplin', 'result', 'less', 'effective', 'devout', 'Method', 'actor', 'Brando', 'repeatedly', 'clashed', 'Chaplin', 'directorial', 'style', 'consisted', 'having', 'actors', 'mimic', 'movements', 'delivery', 'exactly', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'well-cast', 'former', 'Russian', 'countess-turned-dance', 'hall', 'girl', 'who', 'away', 'newly-appointed', 'ambassador', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Brando', 'Aside', 'major', 'error', 'Chaplin', 'script', 'Loren', 'character', 'supposed', 'have', 'left', 'Russia', 'revolution', '1917', 'would', 'make', 'character', 'quite', 'bit', 'older', 'Loren', 'role', 'comic', 'grace', 'captivating', 'charming', 'supporting', 'cast', 'have', 'moments', 'Sydney', 'Chaplin', 'Brando', 'friend', 'advisor', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Margaret', 'Rutherford', 'delightful', 'cameo', 'elderly', 'passenger', 'ocean', 'liner', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'standout', 'performance', 'Patrick', 'Cargill', 'Brando', 'valet', 'Cargill', 'gift', 'comic', 'timing', 'understated', 'delivery', 'here', 'viewer', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'opportunities', 'demonstrate', 'talent', 'nearly', 'walks', 'away', 'scene', 'perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'film.Chaplin', 'use', 'color', 'widescreen', 'appropriately', 'understated', 'keeping', 'style', 'However', 'Chaplin', 'direction', 'begin', 'see', 'limits', 'filmmaking', 'ability', 'least', 'later', 'cinematography', 'appropriately', 'understated', 'however', 'editing', 'pace', 'film', 'bog', 'down', 'Scenes', 'requiring', 'frantic', 'pace', 'are', 'edited', 'entirely', 'too', 'slow', 'losing', 'much', 'comic', 'rhythm', 'performers', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'single', 'long', 'much', 'interaction', 'performers', 'frame', 'instead', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'instructed', 'stay', 'mark', 'deliver', 'dialog', 'film', 'most', 'memorable', 'aspect', 'lush', 'orchestral', 'score', 'composed', 'Chaplin', 'featuring', 'great', 'Song', 'film', 'Chaplin', 'abilities', 'composer', 'point', 'had', 'perhaps', 'outmeasured', 'abilities', 'filmmaker', 'and-fortunately', 'future', 'audiences-he', 'spent', 'next', 'decade', 'composing', 'scores', 'silent', 'features', '1920s.Universal', 'DVD', 'A', 'Countess', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'colors', 'are', 'rich', 'image', 'sharp', 'clear', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'trailer', 'extra']",A Countess From Hong Kong

Just don't expect to be entertained out of your wits.  The whole concept of let the Russian stowaway (Loren) hide in the would-be ambassador (Brando) cruise ship cabin gets tiresome rather quickly, especially with the many failed attempts at high jinks and the no chemistry tag between the two stars. Yet despite it all you just can't help watching these two onscreen misfits make a fool of themselves as the plotline gets sillier and sillier.  Sure, the film ends up resembling an amateur play, and sure, director Chaplin tries his best to make it look all glossied-up (and he sometimes succeeds at it, like the change partner dance routine scene for example), but as a whole THE COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG is definitely bad cinema; but still fun enough to be hailed as camp.

The acting was uninspired and that's hard to say about Marlon Brando.  I was disappointed in everyone although I understood Chaplin's purpose; he spotlighted his offspring although they were uninspiring as well.

He has a night in Hong Kong, his ship departs, and he finds countess Natascha stowed away; a &#8220;white Russian&#8221; cast adrift by the Russian revolution, she forces herself into his life as a tragic, beautiful war refugee. This is a Chaplin film, and there&#8217;s all sorts of comedic situations. But with the screwball romance that was one with the times, this is really more of a Billy Wilder film than a Chaplin film; and given that this is his first attempt to do a colour film, it does look like the cards were stacked against him. The story is a bit flat, with Brando mumbling his way through the drama, and we seldom feel that there&#8217;s love growing in him for this nutty chick who&#8217;s appeared in his suite. Most of the drama is enacted in Brando&#8217;s two-room suite, with Loren scrambling for the toilet every time there&#8217;s someone at the door. Some funny scenes include a crazy night of wave-swept storms, and some intermingling with the ship&#8217;s passengers, including a strange scene stealing Society Girl, played by former Bond girl Angela Scoular, who talks about the immortality of the soul, and begins phrases with &#8220;Daddy says&#8230;&#8221; Another funny interlude with the batty Miss Gaulswallow, who the hopeful young men on board the ship mistake for Natascha. Chaplin&#8217;s son Sydney plays Brando&#8217;s business manager Harvey, and his daughter Geraldine is one of the other society girls on the boat (other daughters Josephine and Victoria also turn up). Tippi Hedren shows up as Brandon&#8217;s estranged wife, and there&#8217;s all sorts of nonsense getting Sofia Loren to marry his butler, Hudson (played masterfully by Patrick Cargill), and Chaplin turns up at age 78 in two scenes, where he&#8217;s only seen peering in the door. Excellent cameos, not a great film overall, though.One of the other reviews notes that Chaplin made the film when he no longer had his own studio, hence less artistic control. Brando and Loren are not comedic actors. Yes, this is all true. It's also a bit sad that so little of Hong Kong is shown in the film!
