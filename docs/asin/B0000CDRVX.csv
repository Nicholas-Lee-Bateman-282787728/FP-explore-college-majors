I fully expected Dumb and Dumberer to be a bomb, but man was I surprised. The guys playing Harry and Lloyd are not only perfect, but they've got a hilarious supporting cast as well.Every member of the ""Special Needs"" class is quite a laugh. The scenes where they're all together had me rolling. Even the store clerk is a good laugh. Though, of course the stars of the show are Eric Christian Olsen as Lloyd Christmas and Derek Richardson as Harry Dunne. Playing a young Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey in his prime is an insane challenge, but they pull it off flawlessly.The only flaw in this otherwise hilarious movie is the entire Principal scamming money plot. Not only is it dull, but Cheri Oteri and Eugene Levy are absolutely horrible. Not one scene of theirs is even slightly funny. Cheri Oteri is just yet another SNL'er who's popular for no good reason. Thankfully they get very little screen time.If not for the lame Principal plot and acting, this would be a five.

775662,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0000CDRVX,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[3, 5]","There are always films that should never be tampered with or given a sequel. Or in this case, a prequel. The original film was a comedy classic that was best left alone. The warning signals also go off when this movie's paltry running time of barely an hour and a half is compared to the original's 110 minute run. Already that makes it sound quick and slapped together without much love or interest. And also, if you don't have any of the original players involved, then why bother at all?. Trey Stone and Matt Parker from ""South Park"", were originally going to do it, but then they backed out. What we got were no name writers and a no name director with not one redeemable value. While there is the presence of comedy genius Eugene Levy, and the always game Cheri Oteri, the rest of the cast were nobody's. Eric Christian Olsen, who you might remember from ""Not Another Teen Movie"" and ""The Hot Chick"", takes over for Jim Carrey playing Lloyd Christmas. He is the son of the school janitor and lives in the school. Derek Richardson takes over for Jeff Daniels in the role of Harry Dunn. He has an imaginary pirate friend and lives with his mom(Mimi Rogers). The movie takes place in 1986, and the film does give off that 80's type of look. The two boys run into each other one day, quite literally, and a bond is made. They become the quickest friends and Lloyd helps Harry at school because he has been home schooled up until this point. Levy plays the school principal, Principal Collins, and Oteri is the lunch lady. The two are having an affair, and set in motion what is to become what passes for a plot for this movie. Schools are being offered a large sum of money for having a ""special needs class"", and with this school not having one, the two plan to create a fake one in order to get the money and run. Naturally, Lloyd and Harry are the first two into the new class, and are then in charge of putting together the rest of the class. This means rounding up a number of goofballs and losers. The only familiar face in the bunch is Shia LeBouf from ""Even Stevens"". The boys get mixed up in the scheme, and with help from a lovely student, must crack the plan wide open. Yawn. This is the best they could come up with?. It took 9 years and this is what we get?. There aren't many laughs in here. Not many chuckles either. Olsen, as Lloyd, seems to be really game, and he is kind of impressive. There are times when it seems as if he is channeling Carrey, and it works. Most of the time. But while Carrey's Lloyd was a loveable goofball, Olsen's Lloyd is just a goofball. The same can be said for Richardson's Harry. Although the resemblances are pretty good. The jokes are not as frequent as you would have liked, and more importantly, are not really funny. The first film's humor and jokes and gags just seem to come naturally. The ones here seem forced and the scenes seem too photographed and planned. There are may gaps in the script as well. Why not delve into why Lloyd and his father shouldn't be father and son?. They could of explained that. There are too many flaws and stuff that just went downhill with no show of effort of even trying to succeed. They tried to live up to the ""toilet"" scene from the original, and while it failed, it was the one moment in the film that *might* give you a laugh, even though it goes against your better judgement. Bob Saget appears in an uncredit cameo, and his two scenes are the only two that made me laugh a little. It's nothing special, but under the circumstances, and with the cursing involved, and it being squeaky clean ""Full House"" Bob Saget, it made me laugh for some reason. If Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, and The Farrelly Brothers aren't involved, then there was no really no hope of this project becoming anything. It was tired, bloated with unfunny jokes and sight gags that were so uninspired, and was just a waste. It could of been something if certain people had been involved, but they weren't, and this film suffers because of it.

But however, this pointless (and unnecessary) prequel may have ruined the Jim Carry/Jeff Daniels classic.  The first one had characters and jokes that acted so dumb ina way where it was just funny.  However, the jokes and charcters in this film just act stupid in way where it just plain stupid.  The formula for the first film was bassically stupid-funny jokes(like in Zoolander) but the jokes in this film are stupid but just not funny.  This movie failed on so many levels and I'll never understand why it was made.  Anyway, here is the plot.Harry Dunn (Drek Richardon) and Lloyed Christmas (Eric Christian Olsen) meet for the first time and instantly become best friends.  This movie follows through their experiences in High school as they fall in love, get bullied (but they do not know their being abused), and attend a ""special needs class"".  However, what they do not know is hat this special needs class is really just a fake class.  Its all just a scheme being done by the Principal (Eugene Levy )and the Lunch Lady (Cheri Oteri) in order to recieve a $100,000 grant.  They only person who may actually realize that this is just a scheme is a wicked hot chick who writes school papers (Rachel Nichols), who sets out to uncover the truth but may need the help of Harry and Lloyd.  Its up to them to stop the principal and the Luch lady of this evil scheme.This movie tries so hard to make you laugh but the jokes are bassically humor-less.  This however is not completely unfunny.  There were the 2 scenes with Bob Saget and he thought Harry took a huge crap and he kept repeating the word $h!t over and over again.

But the amount of jokes in the sequel, and the fact I was actually laughing at most of them (obviously ignoring the really dumb ones) I have to admit, I liked it.Trying to get a storyline out of something like this is really a waste of time.

This movie is the worst movie that I have seen in many years and stands in direct contrast to ""Lord Of The Rings"", ""X-Men United"", , ""Secondhand Lions"" and ""Radio"". Unlike those three movies which are 2003's best movies, ""Dumb and Dumberer"" stands as the worst movie I've seen this year. The acting is unbelievably ridiculous and I can't even by any stretch of the imagination, understand how they could even give the green light to this horrid prequel. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were really funny in the 1994 original movie ""Dumb and Dumber"". The two who played them in this prequel were absolutely annoying and aggravating without being even slightly funny.Adding stale potty humor only makes an already unsalvageable film even worse. The scene with the Hershey's chocolate bar spread all over the bathroom wall just made me sick and lose my appetite for days afterwards. Potty Humor, when done right, can be really funny but it fails miserably on this prequel. The jokes and gags were completely unconvincing and annoying to no end. Just to make it simple, all of the jokes are very bad with a capital B.The number one thing that offends me about this movie to a very high degree is not the incredibly dumb acting and poor script for this movie but it is a HUGE tear down to people who have disabilities. I myself have struggle with a psychological disability (Asperger's Syndrome) and this movie is the most horrific and most disgraceful movie I've ever seen in my entire life. This aims to cash on the plight of socially challenged people of all ages. I have known and went to school with classmates with a wide variety of social disabilities and most of them were very smart, brilliant and extremely creative people. I myself have struggled through high school but managed to have several friends with neurotypical (non-disabled) individuals. I may have had trouble in school in the past but it was because of coming down with several episodes severe depression. Today, I am doing very well in school and am in college.2003 is the year that I will remember when movie qualities took extreme directions. The positive direction was with powerful movies like ""X-Men United"" and ending with a huge bang with ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of The King"" but also falling to new lows with ""Gigli"" and this prequel to ""Dumb and Dumber"".Don't even bother renting this cinematic garbage. This is the biggest disgrace that has cluttered the movie theatres. It flopped for a good reason. People realized that it is one of the biggest pieces of junk that has ever been made. Some may call me very reactionary towards movies like this and I don't care either because rubbish like this that aims to portray people with low IQs and mental disabilities being stupid and doing unbelievably vile and stupid things is extremely degrading and bigoted. Even most people with low IQs and other handicaps can really do some great things for our society and live a normal to great life and live a life just like everyone else.With this prequel, for those who made the big mistake of buying this lousy prequel, throw it on the floor and with FULL FORCE!I hope Amazon doesn't mind me changing the subject a bit. On a more positive note to end this scathing review, I would highly suggest renting or buying the movie ""Radio"".

I went to go see this movie under the impression that it was going to be the worst movie ever, a waste of my time, and an extremly large waste of film. But when the credits started to roll the first thing that came to mind was ""Not to bad."" It wasn't a classic film, but it had some very funny moments. The acting sure was bad, but the bad acting sort of worked with the characters.The movie has our heros from the first movie Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne meeting for the first time. They aren't the smartest people in the world. They meet while trying to get to school, and they bump into each other, literally. Harry used to be home schooled by his mom, and Lloyd lives in the school with his janitor dad. They do not know that they are being used by Principal Collins and his girlfriend Ms. Heller the lunch lady as a scam to get 100,000 dolalrs, by using the two as the basis for a special education class and then they collec the grant money. Ms. Heller is the teacher and to make it look real, they recruit other children. Lewis who is the mascot for the school team. Turk who is the class bully. Carl who is a football player, Toby, and the new exchange student Ching Chong. But Harry's crush, and school newspaper reporter Jessica begins to wonder about what Principal Collins to up to. She decides to bring out the scam, with help from Harry and Lloyd.Of course its stupid, that is the point of this movie. It is one of those movies where you cannot study the acting, and the storyline. It wasn't written and directed to be a masterpiece. The point of this movie was to entertain people, and it did with me. I only gave it three stars because they did not have the return of the stars from the first movie. I also like how they made this movie a prequal instead of a sequal. Sometimes I prefe prequals, because they are usually a fresh new story. Sequals sometimes use the first movie to rip off its story ideas. ""Dumb and Dumberer"" was a ninety minutes movie of grins, smiles, chuckles, and a few laughs.

If you seen this movie, the good news is that you probably would have a hard time seeing worse.The first Dumb and Dumber was a pretty funny movie, and they didn't have to be so offensive in the process. Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels were able to make the characters work mainly because they had a plot and a knack for taking something and making it humorous. There was enough substance to actually make a scene have a comic effect. It looks like they should have left well enough alone, and forgot the prequel.I don't know what they were possibly thinking making this film; it failed in every single respect as a comedy. This movie is insulting, shallow, tasteless and unfunny all at the same time. It really lacked much of a plot also, as the idea of the principal choosing these guys to try to form a class is absurd. The movies really had no direction and no hope. The actors who play Lloyd and Harry look pretty much the same as Jeff Daniels and Jim Carey, but the dialogue is amateurish and petty. There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie, and, like me, you may turn the movie off after 30 minutes or so.I don't say this often about movies, but this one should come with a refund.",1,About as bad as a movie can get,1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,1426,"[""'m"", 'posting', 'review', 'not', 'want', 'add', '1', 'rating', 'Dumb', 'Dumberer', 'rather', 'actually', 'had', 'pay', 'couple', 'bucks', 'rent', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'why', 'everyone', 'hated', 'seen', 'movie', 'good', 'news', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'seeing', 'worse.The', 'first', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'so', 'offensive', 'process', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'were', 'able', 'make', 'characters', 'work', 'mainly', 'had', 'plot', 'knack', 'taking', 'something', 'making', 'humorous', 'was', 'enough', 'substance', 'actually', 'make', 'scene', 'have', 'comic', 'effect', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'forgot', 'prequel.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'possibly', 'thinking', 'making', 'film', 'failed', 'single', 'respect', 'comedy', 'movie', 'insulting', 'shallow', 'tasteless', 'unfunny', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'lacked', 'much', 'plot', 'also', 'idea', 'principal', 'choosing', 'guys', 'try', 'form', 'class', 'absurd', 'movies', 'really', 'had', 'direction', 'hope', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Lloyd', 'Harry', 'look', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'dialogue', 'amateurish', 'petty', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'funny', 'movie', 'may', 'turn', 'movie', '30', 'minutes', 'so.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'often', 'movies', 'one', 'should', 'come', 'refund']",N/A

775688,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B0000CDRVX,"John ""MovieAddict""","[1, 2]","Want to hear something funny? I laughed at &quot;Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd.&quot; In fact, at about four scenes I was rolling over in laughter. And not just me -- people in front of and behind me were roaring in laughter, too.It's not a good movie. It's understandably hated. But to name it the 68th worst movie ever (according to the Internet Movie Database) is shameful. I have seen far worse. Yes, the movie is filmed in the distinct style of a bad movie. It has a bad script. Most of its jokes are bad. It's essentially a bad movie. But it's not awful. And when I left, I had a smile on my face, because I had expected a depressing comedy and I got a goofy, good-natured one with a few good gags and a lot of good spirit. In its essence, it is quite easy to watch and -- perhaps -- just a little bit fun.I say this not out of prior prejudice, as much as I may have enjoyed the first installment, but out of surprise, because I expected it to give a bad name to the first film, &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; (1994). I read all the bad reviews before going into &quot;Dumb and Dumberer.&quot; I didn't expect to laugh a single minute time, and I expected it to be a pale imitation of its predecessor.I did laugh. Not much, but I did. And it's not a pale imitation of the first film--it isn't nearly as solid in direction (thanks to the absence of the Farrelly Brothers), but this is a good thing. If it had been, it would have been depressing. It's an energetic and short little film that actually, believe it or not, entertains, despite its insanely mediocre plot.It's 1986. Lloyd (Olsen) lives with his stepfather (Luis Guzman), the local high school janitor. Rushing to catch the bus for school one day, he turns around a corner and (literally) bumps into Harry Dunne (Derek Richardson), a homeschooler whose first day of school begins on that very day. Lloyd gets his tooth chipped when they bump into each other and immediately they are best pals.As Lloyd shows Harry the ropes at school, Principal Collins (Eugene Levy) sets up a &quot;special needs&quot; program at the school as a way of cheating his way to a 100,000 dollar grant from a pay program, which -- unbeknownst to him -- is all just an FBI sting. The cafeteria cook (Chery Oteri), who is also Collins' lover, plays teacher to Harry, Lloyd and a band of other &quot;special&quot; kids. Meanwhile, Harry and Lloyd's friendship starts to blossom.You want to know the scene that had my hysterically laughing in this film? It's the most juvenile scene in the entire movie, and I know this, but it was great. Bob Saget (&quot;Full House&quot;) plays the uptight father of Jessica, Harry's wannabe love interest. Invited to dinner at their house, Harry accidentally spreads melted chocolate all over the bathroom wall. After leaving, Saget walks in and sees it, completely freaks out, and starts to curse up a storm. Let's just say that he thinks it is something other than chocolate covering his bathroom.Ah, yes. Potty humor. How ineffective it was in &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; and how joyful it is here. Sometimes it's too silly and childish. Other times it's funny. I can't help it. Quoting the tagline for &quot;Wayne's World&quot; (1993), &quot;You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll hurl.&quot; I did all three. Well, almost.I thought it was just I. But no, other people were laughing, too. Not just kids in the theater, but also parents and the attendants of the snack area in the screening room.I cherish &quot;Dumb and Dumber,&quot; the original, because I find its buddies lovable and its goofiness contagious. I am a big fan of the buddy movie sub genre, specifically the Odd Couple stuff. &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot; (1987) will always be considered a classic in my book. So will &quot;Dumb and Dumber,&quot; simply because I think it set out exactly what it tried to do, and it's the type of movie that puts me in a good mood no matter what. It puts a smile on my face.&quot;Dumb and Dumberer&quot; is not in its league. It's too childish, too crude, too immature, too plain stupid. But y'know what? It sure is a lot dumber than the first film. Perhaps even dumberer. Like I said above, after reading the negative press about this film I really expected a shameless cash-in on the original. In a way, that's what I got. But I admire this film's spirit. It knows it's nothing great. And it didn't harm me, despite all its crude humor and childish jokes. In a way, it's almost admirable because the director, Troy Miller, managed to create a film that plastered a goofy little grin on my face without disgusting me like &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; did, a &quot;family&quot; comedy minus the laughs. This one works, in an odd sort of way. And, for once, a film title lives up to its name. This movie is certainly dumberer than the first.Note: I seem to be praising this film. I'm not. It is merely a mediocre comedy. I withhold its flaws in my review specifically because it surprised me very much and, despite being an undoubtedly bad movie, I don't necessarily find it harmful in any way, shape or form. It's a goofy little comedy with a smaller heart than the first but a heart nevertheless. I give it a bad rating because it trips more than it succeeds. But I will add a disclaimer to this review: It's not as bad as you think...and you may be surprised. This film puts a small little smile on your face.",3,2.5/5 stars - surprising &quot;childish&quot; prequel to great orig...,1068422400,"11 10, 2003",2003,5404,"['Want', 'hear', 'something', 'funny',

As adults, they were funny because we expect adults to act in a mature and intelligent manner.  We don't expect large mistakes with adults.  Yet, this presentation of Harry and Lloyd was not funny nor watchable because we expect kids to be dumb, to do stupid things, and as a result, there was nothing unpredictable about the movie.  Anytime you present a film regarding dumb kids it just won't be funny because kids are by nature quite ridicolous.  As adults, we are far more concerned with identifying human frailties adults make, which is one reason that this movie, focusing on the stupid things kids do, fails to arouse much interest.  It is a shame -- because a sequal of Dumb and Dumber may have been successful had it been related to Harry and Lloyd in the future rather than the past.Perhaps one of the most redeeming quality of the movie is its identification of corruption in government, particularly the schools.  The principle and the cafeteria lady are in on a conspiracy to rob taxpayers of money by creating a shame classroom called &quot;Special Needs.&quot; As a result, they do create a shame classroom, with Harry and Lloyd as the broker who finds students to fill the seats.  Yet, it is a special journalist student who identifies this problem and puts the principle behind bars.  We should always remember this in our everyday lives: public schools have incredible corruption and are fleecing us taxpayers.

It looks the same but any idiot can tell the difference. Think of it, if feces was smeared all over the walls, you'd smell it. Chocolate is sweet and smells good. It was the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life. I was almost ashamed that I rented it and spent my money on such an absurd uncreative movie that wasn't even funny, just naseating.

He finds that the Harry and Loyed are just the students they need in their special needs class to get the funding. To prove that this is an legitimate class, they take the special class on field trips and get them doing other class activities.

I question how big-screen successes like Eugene Levy, Bob Saget, and Shia LaBeouf wound up in this flop.  Was the lunch lady, played by Cheri Oteri, meant to be that dim?  Why would a song as awesome as Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger"" be in this film?  So many questions...so few answers.  Sadly, leading men Derek Richardson (Harry) and Eric Christian Olsen (Lloyd) actually do have some good chemistry, similar to that of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in the original film.  But instead of allowing this to give us some fun new stories about this lovable duo and their crazy antics, this only helps to rehash pretty much every joke and most plot points from the original film...the only difference between this and similar disasters is that it's a prequel as opposed to a sequel.  I barely chuckled at any point in this movie (I actually wrote this review while watching the film instead of writing it afterwards) and I could easily get those same chuckles just about anywhere else.  Finally, I wonder why Rachel Nichols, playing the high school reporter Jessica, made any effort in her role...she could do so much better as she was actually somewhat interesting to watch here.

This movie really surprised me.  I found it funny, but I also know this is not the type of movie I could watch over and over again like I do Dumb and Dumber.  So I won't be adding it to my DVD collection.  This movie is the prequel to Dumb and Dumber.The movie shows how Harry Dunne and Lloyd Christmas meet.  We also find out why Lloyd has his chipped tooth.  The side story is the Principal and the lunch lady (Cheri Oteri) embezzling $100,000 that was meant for a special needs program.  Principal Collins (Eugene Levy) wants to use the money to buy himself a condo in Hawaii.  Harry and Lloyd are asked to recruit the special needs students for the program.  Lewis is the school mascot for the school football team.  Turk sho is the class bully, Carl the crazy football player, Toby there is nothing wrong with him, but because he has a cast on his foot, he qualifies.  The last student is named Ching Chong who plays a dumb downed student to get boys.  I felt the Ching Chong name was a little over the top, and I know some people found that to be offensive.  Jessica Mathews is the school reporter, and she smells a story, and knows that Harry can help her.  Lloyd convinces Harry that she has the hots for him, and he thinks he will score.There are some laughable moments, and some that were just silly.  Lloyd using ketchup and mustard to leave a note on the gym floor for his father to read.  The movie used an actual ""short bus"".  Bob Saget really made the movie.  He is hilarious!!!!  Bob Saget plays the uptight father to Jessica.  Harry goes to Jessica's house and he ends up melting his chocolate bar when he sat on the radiator.  Melted chocolate + a clean bathroom equals a scene that is gross, but very, very funny.  When Jessica's father walks into the bathroom he starts to scream and cuss up a storm, and I ended up on the floor clutching my stomach from laughing so hard.  Hearing him cuss was a riot!!!  When Bob Saget screams ""What is it with you and fecal matter"", at the end of the movie I could not stop laughing.The store clerk is quite funny also.  I found the embezzling plot to be kind of dull.  The DVD has a ton of extras for people who enjoy that type of option.The actors that play Harry (Derek Richardson)and Lloyd (Christian Olsen) were quite good, and played the parts just as well as Jim Carrey (Lloyd) and Jeff Daniels (Harry) did in the original.  In fact I think that Christian Olsen played Lloyd perfectly.  He mimicked Jim Carrey's moves, and facial expressions so well, I kept thinking I was watching Jim himself.  I think this movie should be given a chance, it will surprise you.  The movie serves it's purpose.  It's dumb, but it's also funny.This is a decent movie and it's worth watching at least once.  Instead of going by the negative reviews I say rent this movie for yourself and form your own opinion.  You may find you are pleasantly surprised.",3,"Give it a chance, it's actually a funny movie!!!!",1097712000,"10 14, 2004",2004,3149,"['When', 'movie', 'flopped', 'movie', 'theaters', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'terrible', 'Then', 'read', 'reviews', 'still', 'thought', 'should', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'happened', 'find', 'copy', 'movie', 'local', 'library', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'movie', 'really', 'surprised', 'found', 'funny', 'also', 'know', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'could', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'do', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'So', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'adding', 'DVD', 'collection', 'movie', 'prequel', 'Dumb', 'Dumber.The', 'movie', 'how', 'Harry', 'Dunne', 'Lloyd', 'Christmas', 'meet', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Lloyd', 'chipped', 'tooth', 'side', 'story', 'Principal', 'lunch', 'lady', 'Cheri', 'Oteri', 'embezzling', '100,000', 'was', 'meant', 'special', 'needs', 'program', 'Principal', 'Collins', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'use', 'money', 'buy', 'condo', 'Hawaii', 'Harry', 'Lloyd', 'are', 'asked', 'recruit', 'special', 'needs', 'students', 'program', 'Lewis', 'school', 'mascot', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'Turk', 'sho', 'class', 'bully', 'Carl', 'crazy', 'football', 'player', 'Toby', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'cast', 'foot', 'last', 'student', 'named', 'Ching', 'Chong', 'who', 'dumb', 'downed', 'student', 'get', 'boys', 'felt', 'Ching', 'Chong', 'name', 'was', 'little', 'top', 'know', 'people', 'found', 'be', 'offensive', 'Jessica', 'Mathews', 'school', 'reporter', 'story', 'Harry', 'can', 'help', 'Lloyd', 'Harry', 'hots', 'will', 'score.There', 'are', 'laughable', 'moments', 'were', 'just', 'silly', 'Lloyd', 'using', 'ketchup', 'mustard', 'leave', 'note', 'gym', 'floor', 'father', 'read', 'movie', 'used', 'actual', 'short', 'bus', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'uptight', 'father', 'Jessica', 'Harry', 'Jessica', 'house', 'up', 'melting', 'chocolate', 'bar', 'when', 'sat', 'radiator', 'Melted', 'chocolate', 'clean', 'bathroom', 'scene', 'gross', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'When', 'Jessica', 'father', 'walks', 'bathroom', 'scream', 'cuss', 'up', 'storm', 'ended', 'up', 'floor', 'clutching', 'stomach', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'Hearing', 'cuss', 'was', 'riot', 'When', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'What', 'fecal', 'matter', 'end', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'laughing.The', 'store', 'clerk', 'quite', 'funny', 'also', 'found', 'embezzling', 'plot', 'be', 'kind', 'dull', 'DVD', 'ton', 'extras', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'type', 'option.The', 'actors', 'play', 'Harry', 'Derek', 'Richardson', 'Lloyd', 'Christian', 'Olsen', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'played', 'parts', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Lloyd', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Harry', 'did', 'original', 'fact', 'think', 'Christian', 'Olsen', 'played', 'Lloyd', 'perfectly', 'mimicked', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'moves', 'facial', 'expressions', 'so', 'well', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'watching', 'Jim', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'chance', 'will', 'surprise', 'movie', 'purpose', 'dumb', 'also', 'funny.This', 'decent', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'Instead', 'going', 'negative', 'reviews', 'say', 'rent', 'movie', 'form', 'own', 'opinion', 'may', 'find', 'are', 'pleasantly', 'surprised']",N/A

I saw the original Dumb and Dumber in the theater the first week it came out twice!  I simply could not wait for that movie to come out, lol!  ... And, let me just say that I am quite proud of myself for knowing the movie dialogue pretty much by heart (as I'm sure many, many fans do!), and still use so many jokes and lines from that movie all.the.time.Now... having made myself clear that I am indeed a GINORMOUS fan of the first film... I really don't care what anyone has to say (negatively speaking) about this 'immature' little prequel.  It is completely HI-Larious from beginning to end!  Was it better than The Original?  No, of course not!  No sequel, prequel, remake, rehash, etc, etc, etc; never really is!  Will those words make everybody happy?  Again, of course not.  This is the very reason why I do NOT NOT NOT compare these types of movies to eachother.  I always treat them as their OWN entity. NOTHING is better than ""The Original""' okay..?.. and that argument is IONS and IONS OLD. Can we just stop digging up and beating the dead horse here?Anywho, this little gem of a movie was so ""Dumb"", ""Stupid"", ""Idiotic"", ""R3t@rd3d"", ""Pathetic"" -- YES!!  Blah, blah, blah and all of that stuff.  And guess what..?  You are all ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!  YYYAAAAAAYYYYYY!!!  *round of applause to all* ... You know why?  Because that's all it was supposed to be.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  Hence ""the title"" which everybody keeps bringing up.  *scratches head*  Could it really just be that simple...?I know I'll probably never get sick of watching this ""Stupidity-Fest"", just like I never get sick of watching The Original movie over and over and over and over again and over again, LMAO.  So just relax folks! Don't take comedy movies so gosh-darn seriously.  Because they're not meant to be taken seriously.  What would be the point?... LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS MOVIE!!  I always catch something new and just... plain DUMB every single time I watch it, and then I start giggling hysterically like a 5-year old, hehehehe.  SSSsooo friggin' stupid and idiotic!  Ya' just gotta' laugh at the sheer, utter, pathetic-pathetical-patheticness of it all!! (LMAO)  What else can I say?  Laughter is the best medicine, no matter what kind of laughter it is.  That is truth, my friends!  :)  So I guess I'll just continue to be a 5 year-old kid at heart... and I wouldn't change that child-like spirit that lives inside of me for anything!!

775720,A2DWWZ6QIWBJ8D,B0000CDRVX,"Thomas ""moviedudereviews""","[3, 5]","It is so amazing to me not so much that negative reviews were given for this movie but more so what was said in the negative reviews. Granted, this is not a five star movie but neither is the original Dumb & Dumber if you think about it. Alot of you  who saw this movie probably trashed it because you started to watch it with a serious mind and if that's the case than you are probably destined to become a film critic. I'll admit, When Harry Met Lloyd is not the original Dumb & Dumber though it is NOT supposed to be taken seriously. Hence the title Dumb and DumberER! I'm willing to bet that if When Harry Met Lloyd came out before Dumb & Dumber that it would have been more successful than what it was. This movie like the one before it is supposed to be ridiculous. Sure, the original had lines that were funny enough to be quoted but so does this one if you watch it more than once. Now I'm also willing to bet that a good number of the negative reviews were written by those who are solely Jim Carrey fans and therefore already had a critical attitude of Dumb & Dumberer before even viewing it. Well I've got two things to say about that... #1. This movie is a Prequel. That means that it takes place before the orignal Dumb & Dumber. Neither Jim Carrey nor Jeff Daniels would have passed for the 18 year old versions of Harry and Lloyd. #2. Jim Carrey personally worked with Eric Christian Olsen to help him perfect the character of Lloyd. Whether you like this movie or not, you have to give the actors credit for accurately portraying Harry and Lloyd. If you rank Dumb & Dumberer as being a stupid movie than you also have to rank the original as being the same because that's what those movies were intended to be. Again, I favor the original to certain degree but that's probably becaue I've seen it so many times. If you are someone who hasn't seen the original Dumb & Dumber or if you saw it once or twice but don't remember much, I suggest watching When Harry Met Lloyd before watching Dumb & Dumber. After all, you might like it better than you remember if you see both movies in that order. Besides all that, anyone one who has seen the original Dumb & Dumber has to admit that before viewing it they expected it to be dumb and ridiculous though the movie turned out better than what was expected of it. The same goes for When Harry Met Lloyd... if you view it with those same expectations versus viewing it with a serious mind, you might find that you enjoy it. The DVD for When Harry Met Lloyd has a good bit of special features unlike the original Dumb & Dumber DVD. Well, I hope someone finds this review helpful.",3,"Good grief, people !",1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,2635,"['so', 'amazing', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'negative', 'reviews', 'were', 'given', 'movie', 'more', 'so', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Granted', 'not', 'five', 'star', 'movie', 'original', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'think', 'Alot', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'probably', 'trashed', 'started', 'watch', 'serious', 'mind', 'case', 'are', 'probably', 'destined', 'become', 'film', 'critic', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Lloyd', 'not', 'original', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'NOT', 'supposed', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Hence', 'title', 'Dumb', 'DumberER', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Lloyd', 'came', 'out', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'what', 'was', 'movie', 'one', 'supposed', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'Sure', 'original', 'had', 'lines', 'were', 'funny', 'enough', 'be', 'quoted', 'so', 'one', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'Now', ""'m"", 'also', 'willing', 'bet', 'good', 'number', 'negative', 'reviews', 'were', 'written', 'who', 'are', 'solely', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fans', 'therefore', 'already', 'had', 'critical', 'attitude', 'Dumb', 'Dumberer', 'even', 'viewing', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'got', 'two', 'things', 'say', '1', 'movie', 'Prequel', 'place', 'orignal', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'would', 'have', 'passed', '18', 'year', 'old', 'versions', 'Harry', 'Lloyd', '2', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'personally', 'worked', 'Eric', 'Christian', 'Olsen', 'help', 'perfect', 'character', 'Lloyd', 'Whether', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'give', 'actors', 'credit', 'accurately', 'portraying', 'Harry', 'Lloyd', 'rank', 'Dumb', 'Dumberer', 'being', 'stupid', 'movie', 'also', 'have', 'rank', 'original', 'being', 'same', 'what', 'movies', 'were', 'intended', 'be', 'Again', 'favor', 'original', 'certain', 'degree', 'probably', 'becaue', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'saw', 'once', 'twice', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'suggest', 'watching', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Lloyd', 'watching', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'might', 'like', 'better', 'remember', 'see', 'movies', 'order', 'anyone', 'one', 'who', 'seen', 'original', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'admit', 'viewing', 'expected', 'be', 'dumb', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'better', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'same', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Lloyd', 'view', 'same', 'expectations', 'viewing', 'serious', 'mind', 'might', 'find', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Lloyd', 'good', 'bit', 'special', 'features', 'original', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'DVD', 'Well', 'hope', 'someone', 'review', 'helpful']",N/A

775723,A123FC8GL7US1O,B0000CDRVX,Troy,"[1, 2]","Dumb and Dumberer: Comedy. Starring Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson. Directed by Troy Miller. (PG-13. 88 minutes.)&quot;Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd&quot; sounded like a bad idea, and the movie removes all doubt. Inspired by the very funny 1994 hit &quot;Dumb and Dumber, &quot; the film contains nothing that made the original a success -- namely its stars, Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey, and the filmmakers, the Farrelly brothers. But it does give us the back story on how Harry met Lloyd because, well, everybody's interested, right?To call this effort misguided would be kind. The job this &quot;prequel&quot; does on the original &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; is the movie equivalent of surgery that removes all the vital organs and then gives the patient a prosthetic third arm. What's needed isn't there, and what's here we don't need.Even the the title is off. &quot;Dumb and Dumberer&quot; is hard to say and not exactly funny, while the subtitle is intended (for some reason) to evoke &quot;When Harry Met Sally,&quot; but it sounds more like a tribute to the silent comedian Harold Lloyd. Why not &quot;When Buster Met Keaton?&quot; or &quot;When Charlie Met Chaplin?&quot;The movie leaves two young actors twisting in the wind, imitating people funnier than themselves, while working off a script that Carrey and Daniels couldn't have squeezed laughs from. Two young idiots, who will some day blossom into glorious imbecility, meet on the way to high school when they collide into each other on the street. Lloyd (Eric Christian Olsen in the Carrey role) takes Harry (Derek Richardson in the Daniels role) under his wing and shows him the ropes at school. Within minutes, the class bully has hung both of them from the top of the school's flagpole. The bit is no funnier to watch than it is to read about.In moving the Carrey and Daniels character into adolescence, &quot;Dumb and Dumberer&quot; keeps Lloyd's personality intact but loses the weariness that Daniels brought to the role of Harry -- the weariness, that is, of going through life, year after year, without a clue. It's what made Daniels funnier than Carrey in the original, but in the new film that aspect of Harry's personality is gone, and Richardson is left to play him as a wide-eyed innocent. For those keeping score, Lloyd was dumber in the first movie, while this time Harry is dumberer.Eugene Levy plays the embezzling high school principal, who is given plot- pushing lines such as &quot;I think I figured out how to bilk this school out of enough money for that condo in Waikiki.&quot; Levy's scenes with his partner crime, the school lunch lady (Cheri Oteri), have comic energy, enough so that were the sound off one might suspect that fun stuff is happening, but it's not. It's just Levy and Oteri holding up their end, making sure they're not the worst thing in the picture.It's hard to say what's the worst thing -- Olsen and Richardson, perhaps, in a dead heat -- but they're also the movie's biggest victims. Richardson at least gets to be bland. Olsen has the misery of imitating Carrey's physical shtick, the walk, the talk, the goofy takes. And while anyone can be funny imitating Jerry Lewis, there's nothing less funny in the entire world than someone imitating Carrey. It's even worse than someone imitating Steve Martin singing &quot;King Tut,&quot; which, happily, no one does anymore, though the nightmares will never fade.At less than 90 minutes, &quot;Dumb and Dumberer&quot; still feels stretched, with back-to-back musical interludes, halfway in, that seem like a desperate attempt to string things out. In one musical moment, Lloyd dances to Vanilla Ice's 1990 hit, &quot;Ice, Ice Baby,&quot; even though the movie is set in 1986.
