Brad Garrett is in top form as Gleason and you truly get the essence of the man.  My one complaint is that this movie really sanitized his life making the portrait incomplete.  Gleason was known to be exceptionally generous and also could be unbelievably cruel, neither of which this movie conveyed in full form.  But there is no gripe about the acting, which is five stars all the way around.

Jackie wanted to be a funny guy from a young age... but he wan't a natural. This is where his genius came in... Gleason BECAME the Great One.

He was the right person at the right time in the right place (with the right agent!). However, Gleason had his own personal demons which effected his relationships with others.The acting of all the characters in this DVD is great, but Garrett is awesome in this.

953519,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B000BYY0T2,Phil S.,"[11, 12]","Brad Garrett's portrayal of Jackie Gleason is so convincing that for most of this TV movie we forget it's a ""TV movie"", which tend to play a little superficially. My only criticism of his acting is that it lacked energy. He seemed to have paid serious attention to the Great One's mannerisms and expressions but once the cameras started to roll, he apparently forget to inject real bouyant Life into the mix.I do not agree that Kristen Dalton's Alice is impressive. Audrey Meadows was a great actress who was also funny. Dalton's take is purely ""feminist""-aggressive in the modern sense [not that there's anything wrong with that] but Meadows tempered it with the underlying, inescapable truth that she deeply loved this man. To use an over-used noun, Meadows' decidely ahead-of-her-time feminism was ""nuanced"" and filled with pathos. For the historians, it appears that her 1952 audition is not exactly scripted accurately here.The movie ends with a 1980s interview, apparently based on the ""60 Minutes"" telecast. Garrett's Gleason says he wishes that he did another Honeymooners season. Although it's been written that Jackie did consider doing new episodes in 1959, most evidence I've read is that he was secure in closing down the spin-off (39) filmed shows: the ratings were disappointing *and* the quality was so remarkable that he knew another season could only bring disappointment.Perhaps some mention should have been made of Gleason's *versatility*: his composing and conducting; drammatic acting, etc. If the producers wanted to focus in on the The Honeymooners first go-'round in the '50s, may I point out another omission: I feel that many fans do not know that Jackie did not win an Emmy for those ""Classic 39"" - it went to Phil Silvers.",4,"Obvious ""labor of Love"" for Brad",1161993600,"10 28, 2006",2006,1752,"['Brad', 'Garrett', 'portrayal', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'so', 'convincing', 'most', 'TV', 'movie', 'forget', 'TV', 'movie', 'tend', 'play', 'little', 'superficially', 'only', 'criticism', 'acting', 'lacked', 'energy', 'seemed', 'have', 'paid', 'serious', 'attention', 'Great', 'One', 'mannerisms', 'expressions', 'once', 'cameras', 'started', 'roll', 'apparently', 'forget', 'inject', 'real', 'bouyant', 'Life', 'mix.I', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'Kristen', 'Dalton', 'Alice', 'impressive', 'Audrey', 'Meadows', 'was', 'great', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'funny', 'Dalton', 'take', 'purely', 'feminist', '-aggressive', 'modern', 'sense', '[', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', ']', 'Meadows', 'tempered', 'underlying', 'inescapable', 'truth', 'deeply', 'loved', 'man', 'use', 'over-used', 'noun', 'Meadows', 'decidely', 'ahead-of-her-time', 'feminism', 'was', 'nuanced', 'filled', 'pathos', 'historians', '1952', 'audition', 'not', 'exactly', 'scripted', 'accurately', 'here.The', 'movie', '1980s', 'interview', 'apparently', 'based', '60', 'Minutes', 'telecast', 'Garrett', 'Gleason', 'did', 'Honeymooners', 'season', 'been', 'written', 'Jackie', 'did', 'consider', 'doing', 'new', 'episodes', '1959', 'most', 'evidence', ""'ve"", 'read', 'was', 'secure', 'closing', 'down', 'spin-off', '39', 'filmed', 'shows', 'ratings', 'were', 'disappointing', 'quality', 'was', 'so', 'remarkable', 'knew', 'season', 'could', 'only', 'bring', 'disappointment.Perhaps', 'mention', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Gleason', '*versatility*', 'composing', 'conducting', 'drammatic', 'acting', 'etc', 'producers', 'wanted', 'focus', 'Honeymooners', 'first', ""go-'round"", ""'50s"", 'may', 'point', 'out', 'omission', 'feel', 'many', 'fans', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Jackie', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'Emmy', 'Classic', '39', 'went', 'Phil', 'Silvers']",N/A

It is very difficult to do a good tv bio pic because the talent used to portray the subject is NEVER AS GOOD AS the original. Stick with facts. This film did not nor do many.

The others like ""Bud and Lou"" portray Lou Costello as a bitter, angry comedian (even before the death of his son) ""Martin and Lewis"" was embarrassing because the actors bore little or no resemblance to Martin and Lewis, The Three Stooges, The Temptations and Take Me Home: The John Denver Story were okay but the chronology in which events were re-created was in error. The Karen Carpenter Story was sanitized by the family beyond all rationality. ""Liberace: Behind the Candelabra"" was too dark and lurid beyond one viewing, ""Walk the Line"" was not convincing enough for me to believe I was watching Johnny Cash.

Gleason actually had a house built upstate that looked like a UFO.  And Gleason swears that he was taken to Area 51 by Ike and saw aliens in a deep freeze.A UFO house wasn't the only unusual thing Gleason built.  Gleason was a notoriously heavy drinker - but could still quote Shakespeare when blotto - and hung out at Toots Shor's bar in NYC.  When he started broadcasting from Miami Beach, he had the entire Toots Shor's bar dismantled, shipped to FL and rebuilt backstage at his set.
