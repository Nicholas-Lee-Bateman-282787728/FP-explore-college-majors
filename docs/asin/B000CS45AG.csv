But it wasn't as popular in the ratings as the show it came from, ""Dallas,"" which lasted 13 years (1978-1991)--not 10 years as someone else wrote. (By Warner's count, however, ""Dallas"" had 14 seasons because they're counting the 1978 Spring miniseries as Season 1.) I don't have a lot of confidence that Warner will do much to clean up the picture quality of ""Knots"" because the image quality on some of the ""Dallas"" DVD sets is lousy (even their latest release, Season 4).  And I'm sure we can expect a mono soundtrack just like all the ""Dallas"" sets released so far.

961938,A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,B000CS45AG,"Antoine D. Reid ""80sforever""","[46, 49]","Before getting this DVD set, I had not seen one episode of ""Knots Landing."" I'm 21, didn't have any interest in the series but started watching the show it spinned-off from, ""Dallas"", on DVD and decided to give this a try. Well, I was not disappointed at all. This was, as they hype on the back, the ""original desperate housewives."" If ""Dallas"" was about the Ewing men, ""Knots Landing"" was about the women living in the cul-du-sac in Knots Landing, California, and their men.Perhaps what made this series so appealing was the women. Yeah, we had seen Joan Van Ark's character on ""Dallas"" a few times but even on this show she comes off as rather weak and bland. Michelle Lee comes in and owns the show from the first scene she appeared in. It was as if she had been playing the role for years. Her acting is on spot, her expression and feelings made her character and the show something entirely different from ""Dallas."" Also, Constance McCashin who plays Laura Avery was a surprisingly strong character who really progressed in this short first season; she goes from being a typical at-home housewife to suddenly getting her hand in her household affairs.""Dallas"" is great but it seemed to be for the men. It was about aggressiveness in business, the Ewing brothers feuding, and the women sort of took a back seat. ""Knots Landing"" was about the entire community. It was nice seeing the families and cast always together, interacting, helping each other out. If one of them had a problem, it became everyone's problem. The show started off great, taking on big issues that common, everyday people seemed to face; pregnancy, education issues, rape, alcoholism, and so on.It was easy to get into this series. While it felt it took ""Dallas"" a little while to hit its stride, ""Knots Landing"" seems to know where it's going from day one. Quality wise, it was a nice transfer to DVD. The show itself is not dated at all. I'd say if you're into shows like ""Desperate Housewives"" or other primetime soaps and dramas, you'll like this. It has a nice balance of comedy and serious issues. The box is slim, which is nice. I did feel as if the discs were a little strange. The ""Dallas"" seasons use double-sided discs but these are all one sided. The last two discs have two episodes on them each, which seems like a waste of disc space. Yet, the last disc does have a snipet from the ""Knots Landing"" reunion that aired on CBS not too long ago. It features Joan Van Ark and Ted Shackelford talking about Gary and Val's relationship throughout the entirety of the show. Be warned, it does spoil some plots of the later seasons.Rarely do I feel anything is perfect, and while this may have some flaws, the episodes, the acting, the actors and everything about this series completely trumps that and puts this in the rare category of a must have (at least on my lists). Definately check this out; there's a reason this show lasted 14 seasons.",5,A Must Have for TV on DVD Collectors,1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,2926,"['getting', 'DVD', 'set', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'one', 'episode', 'Knots', 'Landing', ""'m"", '21', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'interest', 'series', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'spinned-off', 'Dallas', 'DVD', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'Well', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'was', 'hype', 'back', 'original', 'desperate', 'housewives', 'Dallas', 'was', 'Ewing', 'men', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'was', 'women', 'living', 'cul-du-sac', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'California', 'men.Perhaps', 'what', 'made', 'series', 'so', 'appealing', 'was', 'women', 'Yeah', 'had', 'seen', 'Joan', 'Van', 'Ark', 'character', 'Dallas', 'few', 'times', 'even', 'show', 'off', 'rather', 'weak', 'bland', 'Michelle', 'Lee', 'show', 'first', 'scene', 'appeared', 'was', 'had', 'been', 'playing', 'role', 'years', 'acting', 'spot', 'expression', 'feelings', 'made', 'character', 'show', 'something', 'entirely', 'different', 'Dallas', 'Also', 'Constance', 'McCashin', 'who', 'Laura', 'Avery', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'character', 'who', 'really', 'progressed', 'short', 'first', 'season', 'being', 'typical', 'at-home', 'housewife', 'suddenly', 'getting', 'hand', 'household', 'affairs', 'Dallas', 'great', 'seemed', 'be', 'men', 'was', 'about', 'aggressiveness', 'business', 'Ewing', 'brothers', 'feuding', 'women', 'sort', 'took', 'back', 'seat', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'was', 'entire', 'community', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'families', 'cast', 'always', 'together', 'interacting', 'helping', 'other', 'out', 'one', 'had', 'problem', 'became', 'everyone', 'problem', 'show', 'started', 'off', 'great', 'taking', 'big', 'issues', 'common', 'everyday', 'people', 'seemed', 'face', 'pregnancy', 'education', 'issues', 'rape', 'alcoholism', 'so', 'on.It', 'was', 'easy', 'get', 'series', 'felt', 'took', 'Dallas', 'little', 'hit', 'stride', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'day', 'one', 'Quality', 'wise', 'was', 'nice', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'show', 'not', 'dated', ""'d"", 'say', ""'re"", 'shows', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'other', 'primetime', 'soaps', 'dramas', ""'ll"", 'like', 'nice', 'balance', 'comedy', 'serious', 'issues', 'box', 'slim', 'nice', 'did', 'feel', 'discs', 'were', 'little', 'strange', 'Dallas', 'seasons', 'use', 'double-sided', 'discs', 'are', 'one', 'sided', 'last', 'two', 'discs', 'have', 'two', 'episodes', 'waste', 'disc', 'space', 'last', 'disc', 'have', 'snipet', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'reunion', 'aired', 'CBS', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'Joan', 'Van', 'Ark', 'Ted', 'Shackelford', 'talking', 'Gary', 'Val', 'relationship', 'entirety', 'show', 'Be', 'warned', 'spoil', 'plots', 'later', 'seasons.Rarely', 'do', 'feel', 'anything', 'perfect', 'may', 'have', 'flaws', 'episodes', 'acting', 'actors', 'everything', 'series', 'completely', 'rare', 'category', 'must', 'have', 'least', 'lists', 'Definately', 'check', 'out', 'reason', 'show', 'lasted', '14', 'seasons']",N/A

961943,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000CS45AG,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","A successful spin-off from ""Dallas"", KNOTS LANDING followed the Ewings' troubled middle son Gary (Ted Shackelford) and his estranged wife Valene (Joan Van Ark), as they attempt to re-build their relationship in a trendy Californian cul-de-sac.  Gary is a recovering alcoholic, a Ewing misfit if ever there was one; whilst Valene is his nervous, soft-spoken childhood sweetheart.Most ""Dallas"" fans would know that Gary was originally played by David Ackroyd in a two-part story that launched the show's second season (""Reunion"") which saw Gary and Valene, childhood sweethearts and the parents of Lucy (Charlene Tilton), return to Southfork until the machinations of J.R. forced them apart again.  When KNOTS LANDING went into production shortly afterwards, Ackroyd was already committed to another series and the role was re-cast with Ted ShackelfordThe first two episodes of KNOTS LANDING relied heavily on the story arc and characters previously established in the ""Reunion"" two-parter from ""Dallas"", with special guest appearances from both Patrick Duffy as Bobby and Larry Hagman as J.R. added to create a seamless transition into the new drama (Charlene Tilton later pops up as Lucy, too); but KNOTS LANDING eventually moved away from it's parent show to become a strong prime-time performer in it's own right, clocking up 14 seasons in all.  Writers brought in a host of characters to interplay with the drama of Gary and Valene, the strongest of which being their neighbour Karen Fairgate (the divine Michele Lee), a real salt-of-the-earth type.  In the first season Karen must, amongst other issues, deal with her husband's tearaway, wild daughter (special guest star Karen Allen) who later strikes up an unlikely friendship with Valene.  Stage great Julie Harris also has a recurring role as Valene's absentee mother, Lili Mae.It's since been crowned ""The Original Desperate Housewives"", but the familial dramas of KNOTS LANDING have dated surprisingly well.  This DVD collection of the complete first season includes a brief restrospective piece with Ted Shackelford and Joan Van Ark, plus audio commentaries on key episodes.Includes the following episodes:* Pilot* Community Spirit* Let Me Count the Ways* The Lie* Will the Circle Be Unbroken* Home is for Healing* Land of the Free* Civil Wives* The Constant Companion* Small Surprises* Courageous Convictions* Bottom of the Bottle (Parts 1 & 2)",4,happy housewarming for Gary and Valene,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,2406,"['successful', 'spin-off', 'Dallas', 'KNOTS', 'LANDING', 'followed', 'Ewings', 'troubled', 'middle', 'son', 'Gary', 'Ted', 'Shackelford', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Valene', 'Joan', 'Van', 'Ark', 'attempt', 're-build', 'relationship', 'trendy', 'Californian', 'cul-de-sac', 'Gary', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'Ewing', 'misfit', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'whilst', 'Valene', 'nervous', 'soft-spoken', 'childhood', 'sweetheart.Most', 'Dallas', 'fans', 'would', 'know', 'Gary', 'was', 'originally', 'played', 'David', 'Ackroyd', 'two-part', 'story', 'launched', 'show', 'second', 'season', 'Reunion', 'saw', 'Gary', 'Valene', 'childhood', 'sweethearts', 'parents', 'Lucy', 'Charlene', 'Tilton', 'return', 'Southfork', 'machinations', 'J.R.', 'forced', 'apart', 'again', 'When', 'KNOTS', 'LANDING', 'went', 'production', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'Ackroyd', 'was', 'already', 'committed', 'series', 'role', 'was', 're-cast', 'Ted', 'ShackelfordThe', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'KNOTS', 'LANDING', 'relied', 'heavily', 'story', 'arc', 'characters', 'previously', 'established', 'Reunion', 'two-parter', 'Dallas', 'special', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Patrick', 'Duffy', 'Bobby', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'J.R.', 'added', 'create', 'seamless', 'transition', 'new', 'drama', 'Charlene', 'Tilton', 'later', 'up', 'Lucy', 'too', 'KNOTS', 'LANDING', 'eventually', 'moved', 'away', 'parent', 'show', 'become', 'strong', 'prime-time', 'performer', 'own', 'right', 'clocking', 'up', '14', 'seasons', 'Writers', 'brought', 'host', 'characters', 'interplay', 'drama', 'Gary', 'Valene', 'strongest', 'being', 'neighbour', 'Karen', 'Fairgate', 'divine', 'Michele', 'Lee', 'real', 'salt-of-the-earth', 'type', 'first', 'season', 'Karen', 'must', 'amongst', 'other', 'issues', 'deal', 'husband', 'tearaway', 'wild', 'daughter', 'special', 'guest', 'star', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'who', 'later', 'up', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'Valene', 'Stage', 'great', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'also', 'recurring', 'role', 'Valene', 'absentee', 'mother', 'Lili', 'Mae.It', 'been', 'crowned', 'Original', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'familial', 'dramas', 'KNOTS', 'LANDING', 'have', 'dated', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'DVD', 'collection', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'brief', 'restrospective', 'piece', 'Ted', 'Shackelford', 'Joan', 'Van', 'Ark', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'key', 'episodes.Includes', 'following', 'episodes', '*', 'Pilot*', 'Community', 'Spirit*', 'Let', 'Me', 'Count', 'Ways*', 'Lie*', 'Will', 'Circle', 'Be', 'Unbroken*', 'Home', 'Healing*', 'Land', 'Free*', 'Civil', 'Wives*', 'Constant', 'Companion*', 'Small', 'Surprises*', 'Courageous', 'Convictions*', 'Bottom', 'Bottle', 'Parts', '1', '2']",N/A

It aired on CBS which was home to Dallas and Falcon Crest, two other primetime soap operas. The first season of Knots Landing is wonderful. I especially loved the two-part season finale episode called ""Bottom of the Bottle"" where Ted Shackleford's character, Gary Ewing, admits that he is an alcoholic at the close of the season finale. What an interesting way to end the first season!!!!!The special feature known as ""Gary and Val: Together Again"" is from the Knots Landing Reunion that aired on CBS in 2006 and 2007.

What fun to revisit late 70s suburbia and see how Val, Gary, Karen, Laura and the rest all met and grew to know one another.  While future scene stealers like Abby and Greg haven't yet arrived, this first season of ""Knots Landing"" is wonderful.The writers do a great job of developing each family on the cul-de-sac; in fact, they do such good work that no matter how outrageous some of the storyline twists and turns would be in the ensuing years (and this being ""Knots"", even their wildest stories were never on the scale of Moldavian massacres and season-long dreams), the characters stayed grounded and true to themselves and made everything more palatable.This season also has the first appearance of Julie Harris as Lilimae, the ONLY appearance by Charlene Tilton as Gary and Val's daughter Lucy and Gary's first onscreen battle with the bottle in a gritty two-part season finale.Make sure you listen to the hilariously self-deprecating commentaries with Ted Shackelford and Joan Van Ark, and watch their reunion footage.

The series became even more absorbing in 1983 and 1984 as Alec Baldwin and Lisa Hartman joined the cast.  I couldn't believe it when the series ended.  It was at a peak of interest and intrigue for all of the cast members and the evolving stories of their lives were so rich and enjoyable to watch.  I highly recommend collecting this entire series on dvd, which is what I plan to do, as each season is released.  I only hope that the studios will not delay their release dates too much.

I'm hard of hearing, so it helps that this entire season is closed captioned!Things were very different then.  The episodes were more self-contained than ongoing except the 2-part season ender titled The Bottom of the Bottle.  Those expecting to see the diabolical, yet rather subtle works of Abby, Greg, Claudia, etc. may be disappointed as they didn't come along til later seasons (Abby joins in season 2, so we may not have to wait too long).The writing is very good, but here's a tip: it gets frothier over time so the storylines are somewhat hard to follow unless careful attention is given to the dialogue throughout.  This might turn off potential new fans, but at least this makes for interesting entertainment.  KL turned to intrigue, criminal investigating, etc. in later seasons to survive as it had the more popular L.A. Law on NBC to contend with.Get this show and see what the fuss that's been made about this show is about.

961962,A1FXPZ5K1C1NBY,B000CS45AG,Jeff Pearlman,"[6, 7]","It never got the attention that ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" did, but to millions of fans, ""Knots Landing"" was the best nighttime soap of them all.  While dealing with some of the same treachery and tragedy as their counterparts at Southfork and the Carrington mansion, the residents of Knots Landing were often seen at the supermarket! washing their cars! and cooking their own meals!!!  This wasn't boring; to the contrary, the characters seemed that much more real.Season One used the ""Dallas"" connection more than later years.  The show opens with Bobby dropping off Gary, his recovering alcoholic brother, and Gary's delicate wife Valene, to start their new life in California.  J.R. breezed through town with some nefarious scheme a few weeks later.Almost immediately, Michele Lee's Karen McK--whoops, Fairgate emerged as important a character as Gary and Val.  For the show's full run, she was a true heroine--a principled, liberal, environmentally-conscious mother of three.  To its credit, the show occasionally kept Karen from getting too high on her horse...Mac and others sometimes called her out for butting in too far into various neighbors' business.  In one notable scene Val's mom snapped at Karen for this, yelling, ""Karen McKenzie, you are not family!""  Well done.  Still, Karen was the heart of the show, and her friendship with Val over the years was always nice to see.Couple number three was, in my opinion, the most entertaining of all.  Words can't express how much I love Constance McCashin's character, Laura.  Saddled with insecure, adulterous Richard Avery (John Pleshette), she grew independent, strong, and into quite the quipster.  I think the producers badly undervalued Constance and her character.  Laura's development was truly inspirational, and she deserved more screen time than she got.  If the DVD series continues, watch for her facial expressions at Abby and Gary's farce of a wedding.  Priceless.  Actually, when Richard wasn't treating Laura like dirt, they were pretty funny together as well.  His line at the end of Episode 11 is hilarious.  In a special feature in which Joan Van Ark and Ted Shackleford narrate one of the episodes, they say that Ms. McCashin now works as a psychologist (psychiatrist?).  I am not sure I can deal with the 1987 season of this show...for reasons I will keep my yap shut about right now.The fourth couple on the cul-de-sac, record exec Kenny Ward and his school teacher wife Ginger, stayed with show until 1983 but never really caught on like the rest of the cast.  A couple of the shows here feature them.  If you missed the Wards first time around, judge 'em for yourself.The eighth regular when the show began was Don Murray as Karen's husband Sid Fairgate.  He's fine, but don't get too attached to him.  He became the first of the eight principals to leave the show; maybe the worst career move since McLean Stevenson left M*A*S*H.I waited a long time for Season One to come out on DVD.

I highly recommend this Season One DVD set, but be aware that the series only got better with each succeeding season. So what we have here are 13 mostly self-contained episodes introducing us to the four couples on the cul-de-sac. Some episodes are great and show promise of the series to come, while others are horribly dated and not very good. The best episodes include Community Spirit (J.R.'s first appearance on Knots), Bottom of the Bottle I and II (detailing Gary's struggle with alcoholism), The Lie (dealing with Laura's rape and her stormy marriage to Richard), and Will the Circle Be Unbroken (Val's mother Lili Mae visits). These episodes are great because they set up future plotlines and help us to get to know the characters better. Episodes like The Constant Companion (the only good thing about this episode is that it focuses on Ginger) and Land of the Free (the cul-de-sac is terrorized by bikers- don't ask!) are predictable and hard to watch. The best thing about this set- the two commentaries by Joan Van Ark and Ted Shackleford on the Pilot and Home is for Healing. Both make comments that are interesting, insightful, and amusing that add to the enjoyment of the episodes. The only negative comment I would make is that the picture quality is not anywhere near mint, it's clear this set hasn't been remastered and it looks no better on dvd than it did on reruns on TNT or Soapnet. Otherwise, pull up a chair, grab some popcorn, and get reacquainted with Karen, Sid, Gary, Val, Richard, Laura, Kenny and Ginger and the rest of the folks on America's favorite cul-de-sac.

961967,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000CS45AG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I'm sorry, but it's time for some harsh truths. I have looked forward immensely to the arrival of ""Knots Landing"" on DVD. While neither a ratings giant like ""Dallas"" or a cultural phenomena like ""Dynasty,"" ""Knots"" attempted to tap into something more inherently real. While other shows rode a Zeitgeist that defined excess and over-the-top entertainment, ""Knots"" was relatively grounded. You got to know its characters as real people, and ultimately I think that is why the show is so enduring. One of the few shows to span three decades (it began in the 70's and ended in the 90's), the fan base for ""Knots"" is rabidly loyal.So here's where I get myself into trouble because it's time to ""keep it real."" As with many shows, ""Knots"" took a while to develop its rhythm. While I would rate the program at 5 stars based on its entire run (and no show is perfect--there were many clunkers through the years)--in truth, it's beginning was a bit inauspicious. As a spin off of ""Dallas,"" ""Knots"" followed two less interesting Ewings to a California cul-de-sac. As we meet the neighbors, ""Knots"" unfolds as a generic domestic drama dealing lightly with ordinary family issues and relatively typical conflict. Any given episode might remind one of an Afterschool Special or a Lifetime Movie of the Week.It was not particularly groundbreaking--however, it was refreshing to see something a little more identifiable to the average man. The writing of these early episodes is often weak, stereotypical, or cloying and many of the performances are pretty wooden. I enjoy the season in retrospect--but I defy anyone who won't admit to chuckling and rolling their eyes at some of the more painful dialogue. Because, to me, Season 1 is bad TV--I may have enjoyed it, but I don't want a casual modern viewer to judge the entire series from its first season.As a historical archive, I do recommend the show. It's interesting to witness the more ""mundane"" issues presented here--but what I find more fascinating is that I know this show will evolve. It will become much more morally complex, better scripted, plotted and acted. Many people proclaim season 2 as a stronger year, and yes it is. Abby brings much needed conflict and the beginning of on-going story arcs--but really, it's about another year before this becomes ""must watch"" TV.Ultimately, ""Knots"" endures as the most real and moving of the prime time soaps. I don't want to discourage anyone away from this stellar series. But I don't want anyone to be misled by glowing 5 star reviews, either. This season is a show in its infancy--it doesn't earn those stars until it walks.

961969,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B000CS45AG,L.A. Scene,"[8, 10]","There aren't many shows that aired over three decades and last fourteen years - yet when one tries to think of a show that meets that criteria, many people don't realize that ""Knots Landing"" falls into that category.  ""Knots Landing"" was a show that produced 344 episodes from 1979 through 1993.  During this period, while it never was a #1 show (or even a Top 5) show - it built up a very loyal fan-base.  Back in 1979 the show was a mid-season replacement that was actually a spin-off of the enormously successful primetime soap opera, ""Dallas"".  While ""Knots Landing"" would eventually become a show that would also follow the primetime soap opera format, it didn't start out like that - especially if one watches the first year of the show.  For the first time, the 13 episodes that made up the first year of that show have now been released on DVD - ""Knots Landing - The Complete First Season"".The first season of ""Knots Landing"" basically follows the lives of four couples living on a cul-de-sac in Southern California.  The four couples are:  Sid and Karen Fairgate (played by Don Murray and Michele Lee) - the ""stable"" couple and parents of three;  Richard and Laura Avery (played by John Pleshette and Constance McCashin) - the unhappy couple whose marriage has friction;  Kenny and Ginger Ward (played by James Houghton and Kim Lankford) - the young couple who also has their share of problems; and Gary and Valene Ewing (played by Ted Shackelford and Joan Van Ark).  The Ewings are used as the launching pad from ""Dallas"".  J.R. and Bobby Ewing's brother, Gary has remarried his ex-wife Valene and moved into a house purchased by Gary's mother.  Gary goes and works for Sid at his car dealership as Gary and Val begin to adjust to life together again.Each of the episodes in Season One are self-contained episodes as opposed to the ""continuing"" format of a soap opera.  Here are twelve things to look for - in no particular order:1) The first episode features a brief appearance by Patrick Duffy as Bobby Ewing.  This is the only appearance of Bobby Ewing on the show.  On the other hand, in the second episode, J.R. Ewing pays a visit to Knots Landing.  The writers do an outstanding job at crafting an interesting story in which the ""oil baron"" comes to the suburban cul-de-sac.  Larry Hagman is brilliant in this episode.  J.R. Ewing would appear in episodes in subsequent seasons and the writers do an equally good job.2) Gary and Valene's daughter, Lucy Ewing (played by Charlene Tilton) comes for a visit after learning her parents remarried.  While the writers did a good job integrating J.R. Ewing's character, they did a poor job with the Lucy Ewing character.  This season will feature the only appearance of Lucy Ewing on ""Knots Landing"".  Following this appearance, Lucy would hardly garner a mention on the show.3) Season One does not feature the characters of Abby Ewing, Mack MacKenzie, Greg Sumner, or Paige Matheson.  These characters would appear in subsequent years.  Despite the fact these popular characters are not in Season One, the episodes are still entertaining.4) Sid Fairgate is definitely the ""Rock"" of the show.  He is the ultimate ""good guy"" and also provides a sense of stability to the neighbors of the cul-de-sac.  This is especially true when he sticks by Gary Ewing who will go on a drunken binge the last two episodes of the season.5) Since this season features self-contained episodes, there is no season cliffhanger.  The last episode deals with Gary's drunken binge and subsequent recovery.6) Probably the most interesting and entertaining character is the character of Richard Avery.  John Pleshette is brilliant in this role as the hyperactive Richard Avery.  He provides a sense of comic relief to the show.  I'm very surprised he didn't win some major awards for his portrayal.7) Episode One features a guest appearance by Karen Allen (i.e. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" fame).  Allen plays Annie Fairgate - Sid's daughter from a previous marriage.  With the exception of another episode in Season One that features Sid's first wife, we will never see or hear from Sid's daughter (or first wife) again during the run of the show.8) I've always felt that Ted Shackelford wasn't the best actor in the world; however I never thought he was the worst either.  He seemed like the perfect fit to play Gary Ewing.  Shackelford is at his best during Gary Ewing's drunken spree and recovery during Season One's final two episodes.9) You will notice a lot of the episodes were actually filmed at the beach.  The early seasons of the show featured a lot of scenes filmed on the beach.  Eventually in subsequent years of the show, the beach scenes would all but become eliminated.10) There isn't any big corporation in Season One.  Sid Fairgate is the closest thing to a ""mogul"" - and that is because he owns Knots Landing Motors.11) The only woman who had a ""career"" in Season One was Ginger Ward - and she was a Kindergarten teacher.  All of the other women were stay-at-home housewives.  This would also change during subsequent years.12) Season One also features some of the show's ""darker"" episodes.  Many of the episodes do demonstrate a ""darker"" tone, but most notable are the ones where Valene's mother Lilimae returns to her life (Julie Harris makes her first appearance in Season One); and the episode where Ginger is harassed while Kenny is on a business trip.In its 14 year run, perhaps no show changed more than Knots Landing.  Season One is almost a polar opposite to Season 14.  The episodes of Season One will have a lot of charm and provide for enjoyable entertainment.  This set is definitely worth checking out.",4,Very Different from how Knots Landing would eventually evolve,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,5668,"['are', ""n't"", 'many', 'shows', 'aired', 'three',

It is one of the few Tv series I have followed in my life (along with Dallas, Six Feet under, the Sopranos and Upstairs Downstairs and that's it)....I loved its sense of the theatrical, its fine actors and crazy but often moving storylines. The series hit its stride from about 1981-82 season to about mid 1987 when it all got very silly till they reigned it in during the last two years. This early first season is fun andfascinating but oh so flawed. They really did not know where they were going with the series in these early days and it was long before the series became a serial, so each episode is complete in itself....Its great to see Julie Harris' first tentative appearance, see the Dallas guests there to prop up the series,to admire Don Murray who brought so much to the series and was greatly missed when he left  and to admire how Michelle Lee ever managed to manage that large mop of hair and to wonder in amazement how these fashions looked acceptable twenty six years ago.The commentaries by joan Van Ark and Ted Shakelford are fun but not particularly revealing of anything and is often the way, they dont remember things all that accurately. Their scene together from their reunion special, however, is moving and real....One question ----no one here mentions in the commentary that the lovely young actor Steve Shaw who featured so strongly in these early episodes as Eric Fairgate tragically died in a car crash a couple of years after he left the series. I remember his character was never mentione again, but here would have been a great chance for Ted and Joan to pay tribute to him---unfortunate wasted opportunity.",3,Historic but little else,1147910400,"05 18, 2006",2006,1739,"['fans', 'series', 'historical', 'purposes', 'alone', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'one', 'few', 'Tv', 'series', 'have', 'followed', 'life', 'Dallas', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Sopranos', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'loved', 'sense', 'theatrical', 'fine', 'actors', 'crazy', 'often', 'moving', 'storylines', 'series', 'hit', 'stride', '1981-82', 'season', 'mid', '1987', 'when', 'got', 'very', 'silly', 'reigned', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'early', 'first', 'season', 'fun', 'andfascinating', 'oh', 'so', 'flawed', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'were', 'going', 'series', 'early', 'days', 'was', 'long', 'series', 'became', 'serial', 'so', 'episode', 'complete', '.Its', 'great', 'see', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'first', 'tentative', 'appearance', 'see', 'Dallas', 'guests', 'there', 'prop', 'up', 'series', 'admire', 'Don', 'Murray', 'who', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'series', 'was', 'greatly', 'missed', 'when', 'left', 'admire', 'how', 'Michelle', 'Lee', 'ever', 'managed', 'manage', 'large', 'mop', 'hair', 'wonder', 'amazement', 'how', 'fashions', 'looked', 'acceptable', 'twenty', 'six', 'years', 'ago.The', 'commentaries', 'joan', 'Van', 'Ark', 'Ted', 'Shakelford', 'are', 'fun', 'not', 'particularly', 'revealing', 'anything', 'often', 'way', 'dont', 'remember', 'things', 'accurately', 'scene', 'together', 'reunion', 'special', 'however', 'moving', 'real', '.One', 'question', 'one', 'here', 'commentary', 'lovely', 'young', 'actor', 'Steve', 'Shaw', 'who', 'featured', 'so', 'strongly', 'early', 'episodes', 'Eric', 'Fairgate', 'tragically', 'died', 'car', 'crash', 'couple', 'years', 'left', 'series', 'remember', 'character', 'was', 'never', 'mentione', 'again', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'chance', 'Ted', 'Joan', 'pay', 'tribute', '-unfortunate', 'wasted', 'opportunity']",N/A

If I was a key decision maker at Warners for dvd releases, I'd reboot and re-release Knots Landing seasons 1 & 2 together, throw in some good interviews, a TV special or 2 and redo the packaging with a more dynamic design with cross over characters from Dallas for more customer appeal and call it special edition/limited edition.

More than Dallas or Dynasty.The shows first couple of seasons are more about the every day things going on in people's lives and after that they get into story arcs and bigger than life stuff.

I had no desire to watch a series built around the character of a drunk, gambling loser Ewing Brother and a skittish wife with no gumption. So I never watched it until now. I thought I would enjoy seeing episodes with the Dallas character storylines.To my utter disappointment, every episode of Knots Landing has been the utmost worst example of screenwriting I've ever seen. The storylines & dialogue are not fit to be the work of a 12 year old child. Corny isn't the word. They are awful. Every character is bullied & interrupted. No one tells the truth. Everyone is a victim of utter stupidity. It is unbelievable that any of these scripts were approved for production. Especially considering there were only 3 networks at the time. These are some of the worst storylines I've ever seen. The acting was equally terrible. The storylines are just plain idiotic. Having now watched it, I am utterly in awe at how bad this series really was.Even the episodes with members of the Dallas cast were terrible for lack of a decent screenwriter. This show clearly rode on the coattails of Dallas. I can't believe they kept it running as long as they did. I can now understand why they haven't printed any knots Landing DVD's beyond season 2. Considering some of the junk series available on DVD, this should give you an idea just how bad the Knots Landing DVD sales were. That should be an example of how few fans they actually had & how crooked & phony the ratings were.I own all of the Dallas DVD's & enjoy watching all of them but all of these Knots Landing episodes are barely tolerable to watch even one time... much less a second time. I haven't seen one episode worth watching. This is clearly a case of a series being artificially pumped up by shady ratings manipulation.I was quite astonished at how terrible this series was. Bad screenwriting; terrible storylines and amateurish acting.

961977,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,B000CS45AG,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[8, 10]","The interesting backstory of Knot's Landing is that Dallas was really a spinoff Knot's.  Knot's was first pitched to CBS and turned down but CBS said that the Ewings sounded interesting and that comment evolved into Dallas.  When Dallas became a hit, CBS pulled Knot's from the files and got another hit.All 13 Season One episodes are on 5 Disc in three slim line boxes.Disc One:Pilot - After reuniting and remarrying on Dallas, Gary and Valenne Ewing move to the seaside community of Knot's Landing.  But Knot's Landing proves to be just as volatile as Southfork.  We meet the neighbors on the cul-de-sac.  Karen and Sid Fairgate are next door.  They have three children Diana, Eric and Michael.  Sid owns Knot's Landing motors.  Next to them are Richard and Laura Avery.  They have one son, Jason.  Richard is a struggling lawyer.  And finally we have Kenny and Ginger Ward, the newlyweds.  Kenny is an up and coming record producer.  Sid's daughter (Karen Allen) from his first marriage is visiting for two weeks.  She is taking out her rage on the perfect family.  But we find out early that Karen has her limits.  This leaves Val wondering if Knot's Landing is the right place to start over.Community Spirit - Petrolux is planning to drill off the Knot's Landing shore.  This sends Karen into a frenzy to stop it.  She enlists the help of Gary.  At the town meeting, Laura runs into an old boyfriend, who happens to be the Petrolux representative.  Richard sees this as a way to promote his career.  This episode sets up Karen's character.  When Gary needs to get into the JR's office, Karen seduces JR.  Well, she gets invited to his hotel suite for lunch and gets his motor running, then runs out - in great style.  In the end Gary gets the better of JR but JR feels it as a victory - Gary finally has learned to lie and deceive!Let Me Count the Ways - Karen is starting to feel the lack of marital bliss.  Richard is running for the School Board and has decided to make an issue of a popular teacher with unorthodox teaching methods.  Karen decides to throw herself into this issue but gets caught up with the attractive teacher.  What Karen wants is a little romance in her life but Sid thinks she needs a new set of pots and pans.  In the end Karen holds true to herself (this is a constant with her character throughout the series and what we all love about her.)Disc Two:The Lie - Richard is so obsessed with himself and takes out his frustrations out on Laura.  When this happens she frequents a pick up bar for some attention.  She gets the attention of an artist.  She goes up to room to pose but he wants more.  When she gets home, Richard surprises her and sees her torn dress and bloody lip.  He jumps to the conclusion that she is the victim of the serial rapist that has been preying on women in the area.  At the lineup Laura overhears a victim mention a scar on the attacker and she uses that to identify the rapist.  But he could not have raped her, he was in custody at the time of her attack.  Laura eventually recants her identification and the serial rapist is brought to justice.  This is a defining episode.  It is unusual for a series to have such a deep and rich episode so early on.Will the Circle be Unbroken - This episode introduces Julie Harris as Valenne's mother Lily Mae Clemments.  Lily Mae arrives at Seaview Circle uninvited and definitely unwanted.  This makes each of the girls analyze their relationship with their mothers.  Valenne has flashbacks that show Lily Mae's constant abandonment to further her singing career.Home is for Healing - Charlene Tilton makes her solo appearance as Lucy on Knot's.  Lucy has found out about Gary and Valenne's remarriage.  Val brings her to Seaview Circle and family strife ensues.  Also, Ginger and Kenny's marriage is showing signs of cracking. While Richard and Kenny are similar in they are obsessed with themselves to the point that their partners invisible.  But the difference is Laura is dependent on Richard and Ginger can fend for herself.Disc Three:Land of the Free - While at the local beach, the girls and the kids are terrorized by a group of motorcyclists.  It happens again the next day but this time Michael is hit by one of the motorcycles.  On the way home from the hospital, Karen spots two of the motorcyclists at a burger joint and Sid captures them for the police.  The gang terrorizes the members of the cul-de-sac.  But remember that they can only be pushed so far.  This is one of the lesser episodes but features two great character actors Les Lannom and John Dennis Johnston as two of the bikers.  You won't recognize the names but you will the actors.Civil Wives - Well in episode one we meet Sid's daughter.  In episode 5 we meet Valenne's mother.  In episode 6, Lucy makes a guest appearance.  Now it's time to meet Sid's ex-wife (Claudette Nevins) and Karen invites her to stay the weekend.  Richard once again shows his true colors.The Constant Companion - Ginger finally gets to shine.  She is being stalked but by who. Val is studying for her GED. Daniel J Travanti makes a guest appearance as a police officer (two years before he hit it big starring in Knot's Landing rival Hill Street Blues.)  Priscilla Pointer also guests before her stint on Dallas as Pamela's mother.Disc Four:Small Surprises - Karen is pregnant.  This storyline seems simple but in 1979 a woman's right to decide was a big issue, especially a married woman.  This episode also deals with teenage sex as Eric meets Ginger's little sister and she wants to go all the way and he doesn't.  This is a very serious episode that is well written and directed. Look for a cameo at the beach party by a very young Gary Sinese.Courageous Convictions - Diana's boyfriend is pressuring her to go all the way but she is resisting.  Things get complicated when he steals money from her family.  Speaking of money, another of Richard's get rich quick schemes goes belly up and he needs to raise $20,000 to get even. (That was a lot of money back then.)  Richard is his usual petulant self but Laura finally shows some backbone.Disc Five:Bottom of the Bottle (Parts 1 and 2) -  This is the inevitable episode, Gary is promoted to vice president and in celebration he has some champagne.  This leads to a spiral of drunkenness and it's up to the gang to save him.DVD EXTRASCommentary by Ted Shackleford and Joan Van Ark on Disc 1: Pilot and Disc 2: Home is for HealingDisc 5: Gary and Val: Together Again - This was part of a CBS reunion special.  Each couple talked about what it was like making the series.  This is the nine minute segment featuring Ted and Joan.This is a great series and lets hope they keep rolling out the seasons (There were 12).",5,The Best of Nighttime Soap Operas,1141344000,"03 3,

961979,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B000CS45AG,Nicholas Carroll,"[7, 9]","Finally, one of the best shows of the 80s has made it to DVD (well, the first season anyway). I think part of the appeal of ""Desperate Housewives"" is the void it fills on TV since ""Melrose Place"" and ""Knots Landing"" went off the air. As good and funny as the show is, with the most beautiful women on TV today, it still doesn't come close to my second favorite TV show of all time (""Knots"" is second only to ""Moonlighting"" in my esteem). However, I never saw every season, as I was a bit young when it premiered in 1979. But by the mid-80s, my mom, grandmother, and aunt all watched the show and got me hooked. It didn't hurt that the show had the most beautiful women I had ever seen and I easily had crushes on Joan Van Ark, Michelle Lee, Donna Mills (and the actress who played her daughter Olivia), Nicolette Sheridan, and my personal favorite hottie Stacy Galina (whatever happened to her?).Though ""Dallas"" was considered a spin-off of ""Knots Landing"" by the creators, ""Dallas"" premiered a year earlier, as network execs thought it would be more successful and interesting than ""Knots Landing."" Only with the success of ""Dallas"" did ""Knots Landing"" begin and ultimately, ""Knots"" lasted for 14 seasons, longer than ""Dallas"" ten-year run (turning one season into a dream to bring Bobby back pretty much ruined the show's credibility). From the opening theme song (my favorite TV theme song of all time) to the unique way the opening credits rolled from right to left across the screen, this show always got me excited to watch during its later half-80s heyday. In fact, my dad had a bedtime curfew of 10 PM on school nights, so I had to sneak downstairs on Thursday nights to watch the show, which only added to the excitement factor of this show.Because ""Knots"" covered a huge span of my growing up years, I feel like the characters are real people who I've come to know and love. All that's missing was an annual Christmas newsletter from those residents of the cul-de-sac. With so many story lines, it kept our atttention through the years. I remember most the heartbreaking story about Karen's drug addiction and the kidnapping of Val's twins. And while Abby Ewing often played the villain, I still found her to be an extremely likeable, seductive charmster that Alexis (of ""Dynasty"") never was. Perhaps it's due in part to the fact that Donna Mills is such a major hottie to begin with.Hopefully they will release all seasons of this show on DVD, coming out in seasonal intervals instead of one per year. Though I'm not sure I'd buy every season on DVD (what a major expense that would be)...but I do want the seasons I most remember, especially the ones when Stacy Galina was on. Through netflix, however, I will be able to finally watch it from the beginning at my convenience, perhaps even a show per night. There has never been a show like it before or since. It was easily better than ""Dallas"", ""Dynasty"", or ""Melrose Place"" and I don't understand why it went off the air in the early 90s. I'm still curious what those residents might be doing now. That's how deep an impact they made on my TV viewing habits!**Now that I've watched every episode of Season 1...my impressions: I like the spinning cul-de-sac idea. Not bad for the opening credits...though I'm interested when they switched to the sideways rolling moving images that we're familiar with in the later seasons.I never knew about Ginger and her philandering record-industry husband. I wonder when they disappear from the show. What most impressed me about Season 1 is how stellar Karen Fairgate was from the very beginning. I was impressed in each episode. In fact, it is she who is the bedrock of the entire series, even though it was meant to be a Dallas spinoff with Gary and Valene Ewing. But the episodes in which Karen flirts with J.R. Ewing so Gary can sneak into his office to peek at some important files, or when she thanks a young school teacher for his offer of an affair because it made her feel younger and desireable, even though she declines to actually go through with it (the offer was enough); and when she tests her husband Sid when his ex-wife shows up to see if he truly resolved his unresolved feelings for her...all I can say is, WOW--WOW--WOW! I've always loved Karen the most, and from Season 1, I love her even more. This series is worth buying and watching from the very beginning. Season 1 started strong and we fans know that it will only get better. But in the first season, I was struck most by how well the morality and strength of character comes through in a very entertaining way. You really can follow Karen and Sid's example and lead a very moral, ethical life. These shows teach us things like how we don't need to actually have an affair to learn why just even thinking about it leads us to deep-rooted psychological needs of being desired by someone. To actually go through with the act is a sin, but if someone tempts us, we should examine why we are tempted, what it means, and thank the person for making that offer so we can search the deeper reasons why without actually doing it. Wow, what can I say. This show had it right from the start. Thank you to everyone who was ever involved in this great show that will stand the test of time and stands mountains higher than ""Dallas"", ""Dynasty"", ""the Colbys"", ""Falcon Crest"", ""Melrose Place"", and ""Desperate Housewives"". This show is definitely a keeper!

The cast is so young, the story lines are self-contained in each episode and there are so many things I learned about the characters' pasts.I would have liked a few more special features but the interviews are okay.  Joan Van Ark seems a bit Val-centric, I wished there were more comprehensive documentaries and interviews about the genesis of the show and the creation of the first season.  I haven't listened to the commentaries yet, but there are only two.  I guess it would be hard to comment on every single episode though.So I took a star off the review for the lack of extra features.  But the episodes shine wonderfully on their own.  I only wish they would release more seasons, but apparently season one sold too poorly and there are no plans to release season two.

I bought season1 the moment it was released and I am sickened that there is no season 2 and the buzz seems to be there won['t be anymmore at all.  With all the **** released on dvd I am really angry when we get great shows that never get released or get only one season.  It's worse than getting you hooked on three episodes and cancelling the shows as if it sucks when you moved the time slot three times and never advertised the show at all.  This is worse because the fans are out there, the show has already proven itself and yet the PTB just don't care.  It seems like TV decisions are all made for political reasons-no relation to fans and sometimes I don't think there's any relation to money either because if you're not willing to listen to fans or respect fans or - get this - build a fan base in the first place, thier mind was made up in advance because they are so arrogant that they actually think they know what everyone thinks without ever asking.  AND NOOOOOOOOOOOOO Nielsen doesn't count because it doesn't count busy people who record or those who watch and LOVE multiple programs at the same time.  Cancel our shows without a chance, give half seasons at full price, or no seasons at all or one great season and leave us hanging with no hope for more on DVD.

961986,A1MQTTDA2E551U,B000CS45AG,"R. M Simms ""NJeditor""","[19, 20]","In the beginning, there was a Ewing.Oh, sure, Gary was one of THOSE Ewings, but you wouldn't have known it when he and wife Valene arrived on the cul-de-sac to give married life a second chance. Sure, you might have recognized his handsome young brother, Bobby, who was on hand to hand over the keys to their new life. And you might have been thrilled by the mention of their mama, Miss Ellie, who'd bought the Southern California house for her favorite son, the black sheep of the family. But any similarity between the Ewings of Dallas, Texas and the Ewings of Knots Landing, California ended there...While Dallas was the story of big egos, bigger money and just how different the rich really are, Knots Landing focused on people who were much more relatable to the average TV viewer. Gary and Val wanted nothing more than to try and make a life with one another and, if things worked out, eventually their wayward daughter, Lucy. Next door, there was Sid and Karen Fairgate, with their three kids and rarely seen dog. And who didn't know a neighbor like Richard Avery, who was oh-so obnoxious and often said things about his wife - in her presence - which made anyone in the vicinity cringe? Then there was Kenny and Ginger Ward, the young kids who were just starting out in their marriage and already hitting a whole lot of trouble thanks to his swinging lifestyle and her desire to have her record-producer hubby settle down and give up his crazy ways.Yes, these were the people in your neighborhood. Or they might well have been.In this first season, many of the problems revolved around visitors who descended upon the cul-de-sac to stir up trouble before packing up and moving on. There was Sid's daughter from his first marriage, Annie, who was desperate for a little of daddy's attention. And her mom would later swing through just to make supermom Karen doubt herself. Of course, the occasional Texas Ewing would visit as well, including the irrepresible Lucy. Perhaps most memorable of all was the visit from Val's countrified mama, Lillie Mae, who would leave her poor daughter ready to run for the hills.Perhaps more than any other soap primetime soap of the past, Knots Landing stands up well to the test of time if only because the issues - at least during these early seasons - were relatable as opposed to life or death. What woman couldn't relate when Karen found her attentions wandering after Sid's idea of a romantic gift turned out to be a set of pots and pans? And anyone who's ever known an alcoholic understood the fearful look in Val's eyes everytime Gary was in the same room as an open bottle of booze.Unlike Dynasty, Dallas or similar shows, this was not a serial focusing on glitz and glamour. The clothes worn by the characters was more J.C. Penney than Christian Dior. And we loved them all the more for it. Yes, in later years, the show would venture into the territory of it's more glamorous sister soaps, but during this first season (and those to come, we hope, in short order), the focus was on the people next door.In the beginning, there was a Ewing.

Worth mentioning is episode #4, which deals with date rape (and remains one of my favorite episodes). It still baffles me why Warner would wait so long to release the second season, especially because the show has 14 seasons in total. I'm eager to set my hands on seasons 4-10, which for me epitomize everything that ""Knots Landing"" so excelled at.

961990,A15NLCXF69HL4M,B000CS45AG,Scott A. Humphries,"[3, 4]","While KL was one of my favourite shows, I did not start watching it until its watermark season with Val's kidnapped twins (1985?), and by then the show had already evolved into something much slicker than the earnest suburban drama it was in these early episodes.These early episodes are, however, quite fascinating.  Some of the storylines are clearly ground breaking for the time - housewife Laura getting raped by a man she picked up in a bar, terrorised Ginger being sexually harrassed by a sleazy cop she turns to for help, Karen considering a fling with a radical young teacher, and of course lots of extra marital sex.  Some people have said that these early episodes are tame, but I think they are actually quite racy when viewed in their 1979 context.It's also of course interesting to see chracters like Val, Laura and Karen (the women were always undoubtedly the stars and centre of this show); each of these characters changed substantially in later seasons.  Karen, in particular, is not entirely the goody two shows she later became.The episodes with the ""Dallas"" relations are of variable quality - why JR would take time out from his Texan wheeling and dealing for a minor deal in California is never really explained but Larry Hagman has good chemistry with Michle Lee, while Gary and Val's visit from daughter Lucy (the only visit she made for the 14 seasons that KL aired) poses many more questions than it answers about the awkward relationship between KL and ""Dallas"".While the commentary on two key episodes by Joan Van Ark and Ted Shackelford is hilarious and a lot of fun, the ""feautrette"" is a rip off and it is a shame that Warners could not include the recent KL reunion in its entirety.Looking forward to future releases.",4,A must for fans but the extras could have been better,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,1749,"['KL', 'was', 'one', 'favourite', 'shows', 'did', 'not', 'start', 'watching', 'watermark', 'season', 'Val', 'kidnapped', 'twins', '1985', 'then', 'show', 'had', 'already', 'evolved', 'something', 'much', 'slicker', 'earnest', 'suburban', 'drama', 'was', 'early', 'episodes.These', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'however', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'storylines', 'are', 'clearly', 'ground', 'breaking', 'time', 'housewife', 'Laura', 'getting', 'raped', 'man', 'picked', 'up', 'bar', 'terrorised', 'Ginger', 'being', 'sexually', 'harrassed', 'sleazy', 'cop', 'help', 'Karen', 'considering', 'fling', 'radical', 'young', 'teacher', 'course', 'lots', 'extra', 'marital', 'sex', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'tame', 'think', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'racy', 'when', 'viewed', '1979', 'context.It', 'also', 'course', 'interesting', 'see', 'chracters', 'Val', 'Laura', 'Karen', 'women', 'were', 'always', 'undoubtedly', 'stars', 'centre', 'show', 'characters', 'changed', 'substantially', 'later', 'seasons', 'Karen', 'particular', 'not', 'entirely', 'goody', 'two', 'later', 'became.The', 'episodes', 'Dallas', 'relations', 'are', 'variable', 'quality', 'why', 'JR', 'would', 'take', 'time', 'out', 'Texan', 'wheeling', 'dealing', 'minor', 'deal', 'California', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Michle', 'Lee', 'Gary', 'Val', 'visit', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'only', 'visit', 'made', '14', 'seasons', 'KL', 'aired', 'many', 'more', 'questions', 'awkward', 'relationship', 'KL', 'Dallas', 'commentary', 'two', 'key', 'episodes', 'Joan', 'Van', 'Ark', 'Ted', 'Shackelford', 'hilarious', 'lot', 'fun', 'feautrette', 'rip', 'shame', 'Warners', 'could', 'not', 'include', 'recent', 'KL', 'reunion', 'entirety.Looking', 'forward', 'future', 'releases']",N/A
961991,A3R6UMQ2S39MFY,B000CS45AG,Scott Bray,"[6, 7]","Obviously the prospect of releasing additional seasons of Knot's on DVD has stalled as the sales of Season 1 have not been what Warner Brothers had hoped for. But it doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell you that only having Season 1 available IS the reason the DVDs aren't selling. So Warners, get the clue, and get shaking. We want our Knot's!Come on Warner's, this should be so easy to understand. Even when Knot's was new the show had a major redirect after the first year. But after that Knot's was on a steady ascent, getting better and better each year.Although some folks like myself consider Knot's their favorite show of all times and will want to own every single episode, understandably many people are going to prefer to join in progress after the pace of the series picks up... in other words with Season 2, when Donna Mills joins the cast and everything suddenly clicks.Exciting yet totally believable storylines and an amazingly talented group of actors meant there was never a dull moment. Michelle Lee's acting was so powerful that Karen Fairgate MacKenzie seemed like a real person to most of us who faithfully followed the show. And on top of the already strong core cast a steady diet of fantastic new additions (including of course the addition of Nicolette Sheridan near the end of Season 7) always kept things fun.What it all boils down to is that a show doesn't stay on the air for 14 seasons by accident and without having and not have a loyal, no, make that fanatical following. To this day I remember how depressed I felt when the show went off the air. Thursday night has never seemed the same since.So get busy Warner's because we want our Knot's. Judging this series to be a poor seller based on how Season 1 is doing is insane. If you bring out Season 2 and follow in short time with Season 3 so everyone knows you mean business and aren't going to stop, these DVDs will sell as fast as you can ship them.

During the forum, Warner Brothers FINALLY said they are giving KNOTS LANDING another chance by releasing SEASON 2 sometime in 2009. Therefore, in order for this series to have continued success, We, the fans and any other curious viewers, new viewers, etc... need to show support to buy this series. ESPECIALLY THE FIRST WEEK OF IT'S RELEASE!!! THE FIRST WEEK SALES WILL DETERMINE CONTINUED DVD SEASON SETS OF KNOTS LANDING.....Very much like a new movie, when it's released in theaters, the first week opening sales determines if a movie should/could have a sequel. (think in terms of the recent ""Dark Knight"" movie with Heath Ledger) which was a box office hit the first week (and beyond) when it was in theaters this summer. The movie is also coming out with a sequel within the next 2-3 years because of this success.Therefore if you apply those terms to the first week sales of the DVD release of Knots Landing's 2nd season, it will have continued success, like it's sister show DALLAS. Please, I know the economy has not been the greatest (and it seems to be getting worse) and soon most of us will only be able to watch t.v. at home anyway (instead of going to the movies), please save your money and support this wonderful show. PLEASE BUY THIS THE 2ND SEASON THE FIRST WEEK OF IT'S RELEASE!!! If all is successful, Warner Brothers will continue to produce the remaining seasons of this show as well as another show....FALCON CREST.....that's right, all you FALCON CREST fans out there, according to Warner Brothers chat the other night, sales of KNOTS LANDING will also help determine releasing not only more KNOTS LANDING, but FALCON CREST as well. So FALCON CREST fans.....listen up....check out Knots Landing Season 1 (now) & Season 2 (in 2009)!!! Your show will be next up to bat if you do this.I hope this helps the fans of both shows understand how important buying your favorite show the first week its release helps determine whether or not the studios will continue releasing a series (and other series).

Gibson ""70's tv addict!!!""","[2, 3]","I especially enjoyed seeing Knots Landing from the very begining because I had not seen this show in syndication since skip was a pup ( I don't have soapnet), so it was all fresh and new!!!This show was so well written and the cast seemed to gell right from the start. The characters were relatable on many different levels. There was the young married couple Ginger and Kenny, a school teacher and a record executive. Richard and Laura, a lawyer itching to make his mark, who preferred to have his wife not work and be a stay at home Mom. I do remember these two definately having their share of problems and it will be interesting to see their storyline further develop.I'd have to say that Karen and Sid Fairgate were my favorite couple because eventhough they had their challenges, they shared such a deep love and mutual respect for each other.It was just perfect casting for Julie Harris to be Valeen's estranged mother. In that episode I really liked the way the other female characters Ginger, Karen, and Laura had flashbacks reflecting on their own relationships with their mothers. I also liked the episode when Charlene Tilton's character Lucy Ewing came to visit and faced her own issues with Gary and Valeen.Joan Van Ark was truly beautiful as the country girl making a fresh start in California. I really loved the way she wore her hair and still dressed country style. When she went to the beach for the first time it made me realize how much I take that for granted because I live in Los Angeles.  All in all this was a great first season and I hope the powers at be won't take too long to release the second season, because we've got alot of great seasons ahead!!!",5,THIS IS AN AWESOME FIRST SEASON WITH OUTSTANDING WRITING & A SUPERB CAST!!!,1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,1681,"['especially', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'very', 'begining', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'show', 'syndication', 'skip', 'was', 'pup', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'soapnet', 'was', 'fresh', 'new', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'cast', 'seemed', 'gell', 'right', 'start', 'characters', 'were', 'relatable', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'was', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'Ginger', 'Kenny', 'school', 'teacher', 'record', 'executive', 'Richard', 'Laura', 'lawyer', 'itching', 'make', 'mark', 'who', 'preferred', 'have', 'wife', 'not', 'work', 'be', 'stay', 'home', 'Mom', 'do', 'remember', 'two', 'definately', 'having', 'share', 'problems', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'storyline', 'further', 'develop.I', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Karen', 'Sid', 'Fairgate', 'were', 'favorite', 'couple', 'had', 'challenges', 'shared', 'deep', 'love', 'mutual', 'respect', 'other.It', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'casting', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'be', 'Valeen', 'estranged', 'mother', 'episode', 'really', 'liked', 'way', 'other', 'female', 'characters', 'Ginger', 'Karen', 'Laura', 'had', 'flashbacks', 'reflecting', 'own', 'relationships', 'mothers', 'also', 'liked', 'episode', 'when', 'Charlene', 'Tilton', 'character', 'Lucy', 'Ewing', 'came', 'visit', 'faced', 'own', 'issues', 'Gary', 'Valeen.Joan', 'Van', 'Ark', 'was', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'country', 'girl', 'making', 'fresh', 'start', 'California', 'really', 'loved', 'way', 'wore', 'hair', 'still', 'dressed', 'country', 'style', 'When', 'went', 'beach', 'first', 'time', 'made', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'take', 'granted', 'live', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'was', 'great', 'first', 'season', 'hope', 'powers', 'be', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'release', 'second', 'season', ""'ve"", 'got', 'alot', 'great', 'seasons', 'ahead']",N/A

It was Lorimar, the owner of both series, who told Jacobs to come up with a far more glamorous serial than ""Knots Landing"", and the outcome was ""Dallas"". It wasn't until the former was a runaway hit in the ratings that ""Knots Landing"" would see its debut on network TV being a spin-off of the Texas serial featuring the alcoholic and disowned heir of the Ewing clan, Gary. He along with his wife Valene embarked on a new life in Southern California in a cul-de-sac called Knots Landing, a suburb of Los Angeles. One of the reasons for Gary and Val moving thousands of miles away from Dallas was to be rid of J.R. and his dastardly ways.Once settled in Knots Landing the Ewings met their neighbors and realized with astonishment that their new-found friends had as many, if not more, problems than they and that is how the plots started. There was Karen (played with masterful acting ability by theatre legend Michelle Lee) and Sid with two sons who were dealing with the teenage problems of Sid's oldest child by another woman; Laura and Richard Avery, living a loveless marriage due to the weakeness of the husband; and a cute couple, Kenny and Ginger, who were trying to start a family while Kenny was embarking on a musical career.""Dallas"" stars Larry Hagman and Patrick Duffy made a few appearances in this freshman season to spark interest in ""Knots Landing"", but their appearances didn't do much for the ratings; the first season finished at a paltry #32 with a 15.2 Nielsen Rating. Still, CBS stood by the show and as the seasons progressed and as primetime soaps went on to be the staple of nighttime television in the eighties, ""Knots Landing"" became a giant. Many critics referred to ""Knots landing"" as being the most realistic soap on the air, while its competition, shows like ""Dynasty"" and ""Falcon Crest"", were seen as big-budgeted, big-money, serials depicting back-stabbing amongst the wealthy. ""Knots Landing"" was a serial that dealt with real problems such as alcoholism, rape, and adultery, and to this day it still holds a place in the hearts of millions who first discovered it when it originally aired.This first season set contains all 13 episodes of season one including the original pilot, audio commentaries on select episodes, as well as a few interviews with some of the series' stars.It did take Warner Brothers three years to release season 2 on DVD, but thankfully it is available, but be forwarned; due to slow sales of both seasons the studio has not announced any more releases of future sets of ""Knots Landing"".

What show? A spin-off of their already hit, of course. Instead of exiting main characters into a spin-off series, CBS decided to transfer two secondary characters with casualties into the new show: Gary Ewing (Ted Shackelford), the middle black sheep son of the wealthy Ewing clan of Texas; and his wife Valene Clements Ewing (Joan Van Ark), who he has married for the second time. After remarrying, Gary and Valene decide to move away from Texas, therefore Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), Gary's mother, buys them a house in southern California. Despite misgivings, Gary and Valene do not tell their teenage daughter Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton) that they've remarried, but she does know their moving and where, but does not go with them.Upon arriving in California, Gary and Valene met their neighbors: Sid and Karen Fairgate (Don Murray and Michele Lee), the self-described ""neighborhood Brady Bunch"". Together, they had three teenaged children, Eric (Steve Shaw), Diana (Claudia Lonow), and Michael (Patrick Petersen). Sid's daughter from his first marriage, Annie Fairgate (Karen Allen) who goes and has sex in Karen's and Sid's bed would make her only appearance on the pilot episode of the show, and Sid's ex-wife and Annie's mother, Susan Philby (Claudette Nevins) would make her only appearance later in first season episode ""Civil Wives"". Likewise, Gary and Val's daughter Lucy (Charlene Tilton) made her only appearance during the first season but then remained on Dallas, even though Gary and Val's original plan was to bring Lucy to California. Also living in the cul-de-sac were corporate lawyer Richard Avery and his wife Laura (John Pleshette and Constance McCashin), parents of a young son, Jason, and young newlyweds Kenny and Ginger Ward (James Houghton and Kim Lankford).Gary took a job at Knots Landing Motors, a Ford-Lincoln-Mercury (hence, the show's early sponsors) car dealership owned by Sid. He did such a good job that by the end of the first season he was promoted. Gary got drunk at his promotion party, causing a binge in the two-part season finale, ""Bottom of the Bottle"". Ginger caught her record producer husband, Kenny, cheating on her with a singer, Sylvie (Louise Vallance), and broke up with him. When Richard wanted to borrow money from Laura's father Hank Murphy (Harry Bellaver), Laura allowed him on the condition that Richard let her go to work. Richard was forced to relent, and Laura saw that she did not have to live by her husband's rules all the time.Knots Landing, while well-received from critics, did not overly impress audiences during its earlier seasons. It's first episode, which aired on December 27, 1979, placed at a moderate 36th in the ratings for the week. It's viewership mildly grew as the season progressed, and placed the 1979--80 season at 28th in the Nielsen ratings. Season one is not the best season of Knots Landing. It doesn't have the melodrama as its later years do, but is enjoyable. It's very unlike its spun-off series Dallas, which deals heavily on suspense and melodrama, and its later rival shows Dynasty and Falcon Crest.",4,Knots Landing: Complete 1st Season,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,3230,"['Dallas', 'was', 'exploding', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'CBS', 'network', 'wanted', 'show', 'would', 'equally', 'successful', 'What', 'show', 'spin-off', 'already', 'hit', 'course', 'Instead', 'exiting', 'main', 'characters', 'spin-off', 'series', 'CBS', 'decided', 'transfer', 'two', 'secondary', 'characters', 'casualties', 'new', 'show', 'Gary', 'Ewing', 'Ted', 'Shackelford', 'middle', 'black', 'sheep', 'son', 'wealthy', 'Ewing', 'clan', 'Texas', 'wife', 'Valene', 'Clements', 'Ewing', 'Joan', 'Van', 'Ark', 'who', 'married', 'second', 'time', 'remarrying', 'Gary', 'Valene', 'decide', 'move', 'away', 'Texas', 'therefore', 'Miss', 'Ellie', 'Ewing', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'Gary', 'mother', 'house', 'southern', 'California', 'misgivings', 'Gary', 'Valene', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'Ewing', 'Charlene', 'Tilton', ""'ve"", 'remarried', 'know', 'moving', 'where', 'not', 'go', 'them.Upon', 'arriving', 'California', 'Gary', 'Valene', 'met', 'neighbors', 'Sid', 'Karen', 'Fairgate', 'Don', 'Murray', 'Michele', 'Lee', 'self-described', 'neighborhood', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Together', 'had', 'three', 'teenaged', 'children', 'Eric', 'Steve', 'Shaw', 'Diana', 'Claudia', 'Lonow', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'Petersen', 'Sid', 'daughter', 'first', 'marriage', 'Annie', 'Fairgate', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'who', 'sex', 'Karen', 'Sid', 'bed', 'would', 'make', 'only', 'appearance', 'pilot', 'episode', 'show', 'Sid', 'ex-wife', 'Annie', 'mother', 'Susan', 'Philby', 'Claudette', 'Nevins', 'would', 'make', 'only', 'appearance', 'later', 'first', 'season', 'episode', 'Civil', 'Wives', 'Likewise', 'Gary', 'Val', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'Charlene', 'Tilton', 'made', 'only', 'appearance', 'first', 'season', 'then', 'remained', 'Dallas', 'even', 'Gary', 'Val', 'original', 'plan', 'was', 'bring', 'Lucy', 'California', 'Also', 'living', 'cul-de-sac', 'were', 'corporate', 'lawyer', 'Richard', 'Avery', 'wife', 'Laura', 'John', 'Pleshette', 'Constance', 'McCashin', 'parents', 'young', 'son', 'Jason', 'young', 'newlyweds', 'Kenny', 'Ginger', 'Ward', 'James', 'Houghton', 'Kim', 'Lankford', '.Gary', 'took', 'job', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'Motors', 'Ford-Lincoln-Mercury', 'hence', 'show', 'early', 'sponsors', 'car', 'dealership', 'owned', 'Sid', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'promoted', 'Gary', 'got', 'drunk', 'promotion', 'party', 'causing', 'binge', 'two-part', 'season', 'finale', 'Bottom', 'Bottle', 'Ginger', 'caught', 'record', 'producer', 'husband', 'Kenny', 'cheating', 'singer', 'Sylvie', 'Louise', 'Vallance', 'broke', 'up', 'When', 'Richard', 'wanted', 'borrow', 'money', 'Laura', 'father', 'Hank', 'Murphy', 'Harry', 'Bellaver', 'Laura', 'allowed', 'condition', 'Richard', 'let', 'go', 'work', 'Richard', 'was', 'forced', 'relent', 'Laura', 'saw', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'live', 'husband', 'rules', 'time.Knots', 'Landing', 'well-received', 'critics', 'did', 'not', 'overly', 'impress', 'audiences', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'first', 'episode', 'aired', 'December', '27', '1979', 'placed', 'moderate', '36th', 'ratings', 'week', 'viewership', 'mildly', 'grew', 'season', 'progressed', 'placed', '1979', '80', 'season', '28th', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'Season', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'season', 'Knots', 'Landing', ""n't"", 'have', 'melodrama', 'later', 'years', 'do', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'spun-off', 'series', 'Dallas', 'heavily', 'suspense', 'melodrama', 'later', 'rival', 'Dynasty', 'Falcon', 'Crest']",N/A

961997,A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ,B000CS45AG,Todd7,"[0, 0]","Knots Landing season 1 (13 episodes) marked  the beginning of an era of prime time soap opera dominance that would consume the 1980's. Launched in late 1979, the abbreviated first season had viewers getting a feel for the characters, most of which started out as mostly happy and innocent couples living on Seaview Circle. The lone exceptions were Gary and Valene Ewing (played by Ted Shackelford and Joan Van Ark) whose checkered past is depicted in the early Dallas episodes of 1978. Still, they start out as a couple with a fresh start and renewed vitality once they arrive in California. However................well, I don't want to spoil it, but let's just say that Gary has some troubles ahead, as does everyone else on the show. This first season is without the iconic Donna Mills, who made a lot of lives miserable starting with her arrival in season two. For those of us who love Knots Landing, this juncture resulted in bigger ratings, and 14 wonderful seasons in all, which gives the show legendary status. Or so we thought. Due to poor sales, Warner decided not to finish the project, leaving 12 seasons behind. This disservice is based on money and nothing else. Why the poor sales? Perhaps Knots is too far removed to appeal to a younger audience? A reboot of Dallas (the more popular of the two shows) has an appeal to a younger audience, thereby sparking curiosity about the original series, adding strength to already good sales from the older fans. Knots Landing is a somewhat inferior show to Dallas, but it's still pure entertainment, and has a more genuine feeling to it. There's never a dull moment, and the characters are interesting to say the least. I would love to see the remaining 12 seasons on DVD, as it's owed to longtime supporting fans. Knots has been called the ""Original Desperate Housewives"", and for that alone, it deserves an official DVD anthology. I particularly like Kim Lankford in this series; she's a very good actress, and her character is very likable. Of course, there are the occasional appearances by Charlene Tilton, Patrick Duffy, and Larry Hagman from Dallas. In typical fashion, J.R. wastes no time stirring the pot. I highly recommend this first season of Knots Landing on DVD. It's my understanding that the whole series can be purchased elsewhere, so I will look into that. For now, I'm enjoying this first season.

The cast is top notch, great story development and characters we can all relate to.I want season 2 on DVD that is when Donna Mills joins that cast and things begin to really take off.",5,Buy this DVD,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,537,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'full', 'retail-thats', 'how', 'badly', 'wanted', 'Think', 'bargain', 'are', 'getting', 'today', '50', '%', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'Season', '1', 'shows', 'have', 'begining', 'middle', 'end', 'hour-it', 'would', 'be', 'later', 'seasons', 'will', 'expand', 'serial', 'format-so', 'do', 'favor', 'tune', 'best', 'written', 'televison', 'show', 'ever', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'great', 'story', 'development', 'characters', 'can', 'relate', 'to.I', 'want', 'season', '2', 'DVD', 'when', 'Donna', 'Mills', 'cast', 'things', 'begin', 'really', 'take', 'off']",N/A
