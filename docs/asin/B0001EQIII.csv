802914,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B0001EQIII,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[8, 8]","Joan Davis (radio comedian) plays an empty-headed house wife. Jim Backus (Peter Bowers in ""Boys' Night Out"") plays the husband, Judge Bradley Stevens (1952-1955) (38 episodes, 1952-1955).Each episode is a wholly contained story that starts out sane and logical. As time go on unlikely elements creep in to make the situation hysterically ridicules. Eventually everything is wrapped up. The actors and their characters is what make this comedy work so well.Disk 1:Prize FighterWall SafeJoan's HaircutChanging HousesTalent ScoutBad BoyDisk 2:HoneymoonHome MoviesNew HouseNeighborsAlterationSister PatMy Little Margie - DVD Collection #1",4,"Discover or rediscover ""I married Joan""",1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,634,"['Joan', 'Davis', 'radio', 'comedian', 'empty-headed', 'house', 'wife', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Peter', 'Bowers', 'Boys', 'Night', 'Out', 'husband', 'Judge', 'Bradley', 'Stevens', '1952-1955', '38', 'episodes', '1952-1955', '.Each', 'episode', 'wholly', 'contained', 'story', 'out', 'sane', 'logical', 'time', 'go', 'unlikely', 'elements', 'creep', 'make', 'situation', 'hysterically', 'Eventually', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'actors', 'characters', 'what', 'make', 'comedy', 'work', 'so', 'well.Disk', '1', 'Prize', 'FighterWall', 'SafeJoan', 'HaircutChanging', 'HousesTalent', 'ScoutBad', 'BoyDisk', '2', 'HoneymoonHome', 'MoviesNew', 'HouseNeighborsAlterationSister', 'PatMy', 'Little', 'Margie', 'DVD', 'Collection', '1']",N/A

She's at the top of the list along with Tracy Ullman and Carol Burnett. The underrated and very talented Jim Backus was a wonderful foil. Funny in his own right, he was also a solid dramatic actor. See ""Rebel Without a Cause.""  I wish they would give a fully restored release treatment on dvd of ""I Married Joan."" Comedy tends to date but there are a lot of examples of 1950s comedy series that don't.

802917,A75KD0YWU2AK7,B0001EQIII,Galen Halimar,"[0, 0]","Joan Davis' comedy set a standard that was studied by other comedians, including the British comedian John Cleve.  She was the natural clutzy gal who means well but somehow screws up.  You recognize in her problems similar situations in your own life, and you have to laugh, no need for a laugh track.  I am disgusted with what passes for modern TV comedy, which wouldn't raise a smile without the silly laugh track they all have.Joan Davis was unique, a natural comedienne who mixed slapstick with everyday funny situations.  She makes ""I Love Lucy"" seem strained by comparison.  I only wish she had not had such a short career and a troubled life.  She was a great talent you will not forget.

Her humor was never insulting to her public, she did her physical comedy that was believeable, interesting and funny.
