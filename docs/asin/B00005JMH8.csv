This movie is based on that book and a few other myths surrounding The siege of Troy and it's eventual sacking. This goes beyond the movie Troy and tells Helen's story. Helen in this film is seen to be stronger than in her other portrayals and a woman who just can't seem to catch a break. They also go a bit into Paris' back story and actually do both stories justice. They even bothered to tell how the Trojan War came about even before it started with the oath taken by the leaders of the Greeks.The siege and sack of Troy are done very nicely in this movie without being too bloody, too long, or too anything else. The ending is also pretty satisfying because I don't believe any other movie ends like it does. It wasn't 100% correct, but still different.This was another made for TV movie that does its job very well. The cast and crew took their time and it paid off.",4,The face that launched 1000 ships,1232582400,"01 22, 2009",2009,938,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'Iliad', 'really', 'love', 'book', 'classic', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'few', 'other', 'myths', 'surrounding', 'siege', 'Troy', 'eventual', 'sacking', 'movie', 'Troy', 'Helen', 'story', 'Helen', 'film', 'seen', 'be', 'stronger', 'other', 'portrayals', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'break', 'also', 'go', 'bit', 'Paris', 'back', 'story', 'actually', 'do', 'stories', 'justice', 'even', 'bothered', 'tell', 'how', 'Trojan', 'War', 'came', 'about', 'even', 'started', 'oath', 'taken', 'leaders', 'Greeks.The', 'siege', 'sack', 'Troy', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'nicely', 'movie', 'being', 'too', 'bloody', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'anything', 'else', 'ending', 'also', 'pretty', 'satisfying', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'other', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'correct', 'still', 'different.This', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'job', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'crew', 'took', 'time', 'paid', 'off']",Helen of Troy

As an adaptation of the Trojan War, it fails miserably.  The reason: the script for ""Helen of Troy"" deviates far too much from ancient sources.  The mini-series starts off well enough -  Queen Hecuba of Troy gives birth to Alexandros.  His sister, Cassandra, who foresees the destruction of Troy if the newborn prince lives, begs her father to kill him.  King Priam trusts his daughter's ability to foretell the future and exposes the baby on a precipice.  A kindly shepherd chances upon the baby and adopts him.  Years later, Alexandros, named Paris by his adopted father, dreams of three goddesses who commands him to judge which one of them is loveliest.  Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love, bribes him with an image of young Helen.  So far so good.  But bad signs start to appear.  We see Helen's brother, Pollux, but not his twin brother, Castor.  Hello?  Doesn't anybody know that Castor and Pollux are the twins that make up the Gemini constellation?  Pollux should also be more appropriately called Polydeuces - other annoying examples of Roman names being used abound, but I digress.  Prince Agamemnon of Mycenae visits Sparta and is granted the hand of King Tyndareus' eldest daughter, Clytemnestra.  He discovers too late that the younger daughter is much more alluring.  Shortly thereafter, the young Helen is kidnapped by Theseus, King of Athens.  This is accurate but what follows is again not.  Pollux rescues Helen but is killed in the process.  An angry Tyndareus, now deprived of his heir, renounces Helen to whoever will have her.  Odysseus proposes that the Greek kings draw lots - the lot falls to Menelaus.  What Menelaus does next is not adequately explained.  He is clearly besotted with Helen, yet the script writers will have him parade her naked amongst the Greek kings, a deplorable affront that pushes Helen into the arms of the newly arrived Trojan envoy, Paris, who has been reconciled with his parents.  Priam grants Helen sanctuary despite the objections of both Cassandra and Hector - apparently, in this version, Priam has only three children instead of fifty.  Agamemnon assembles the Greek army at Aulis, but unfavourable winds prevent the Greek ships from sailing.  Agamemnon is told that he must sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia, to obtain favourable winds - this he does.  Off the army goes to sack Troy.  Skip ten years forward, and we should expect to see a version of the Iliad.  Unfortunately, we do not.  What we have next is a complete travesty of the Iliad.  The central character, Achilles, is here twisted into something completely unrecognisable.  Achilles is here portrayed by a BALD actor - oh, come on - the real Achilles was no Vin Diesel wannabe.  In literature and in art, Achilles had always been portrayed as having long, flowing locks, a man who is almost beautiful but for his warrior's bearing.  Also, Achilles may be capable of incredibly bloodthirstiness, but he was also capable of supreme kindness.  But of course, the script writers would have none of that here.  In single combat, Achilles kills Hector by throwing his spear while Hector least expects it, a most cowardly act.  He then ties Hector's body to his chariot and drags it around the battlefield - we are not told why Hector would merit such desecration, except that the Greek army almost without exception are portrayed as scum.  We are further denied the sublime scene in the Iliad where Priam sneaks into the Greek camp and begs Achilles for Hector's body, softening the heart of the man who killed so many of his sons.  Instead, it is Helen who sneaks into Agamemnon's camp to redeem Hector's body but realises that Agamemnon is insane and will be satisfied with nothing less than her total humiliation and the utter annihilation of the Trojans.  She escapes back to Troy, aided by Paris, who dies in the hands of Agamemnon.  What happens next is the usual stuff - the Greeks pretend to sail for home, leaving behind a huge wooden horse, which the Trojans drag into their city.  Greeks hidden within then open the city gates, and the Greek army sack and burn Troy.  Then another ""innovation"" happens - Helen is raped by Agamemnon before the powerless gaze of Menelaus.  In the mini-series'  best scene, Clytemnestra arrives, sets her sister free, throws a net over an unsuspecting Agamemnon, and then hacks him to death to avenge Iphigenia.  The closing scene has Helen kneeling by the spot where Paris died, gently touching his blood stains, and then telling Menelaus that she could never love him but will follow wherever he leads.  The complete story of the Trojan War just cannot be adequately covered in three hours.  My dream version would be a season-long mini-series with 22 hour-long episodes which sticks to the ancient sources as closely as possible.  The ancient sources include: Cypria (the gods plot the beginnings of the war), Iphigenia at Aulis (the sacrifice of Iphigenia), Iliad (the wrath of Achilles), Aethiopis (the death of Memnon), Iliupersis (the destruction of Troy), Little Iliad and The Fall of Troy (the deaths of Penthesileia, Memnon, Achilles, Ajax and Paris), Nostoi (the return of the Greeks), and Agamemnon (the death of Agamemnon).  This version falls far short of that ideal.",2,Missed opportunity for true epic retelling - spoilers ahead.,1061683200,"08 24, 2003",2003,5357,"['drama', 'love', 'lust', 'greed', 'ambition',

618857,APP5MBH2BSX6I,B00005JMH8,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[3, 4]","This review is from the perspective of having seen the big bucks film ""Troy,"" starring Brad Pitt, and not having read Homer's ""Iliad"" itself.The remarkably uneven film ""Troy"" left a lot to be desired for those of us who would rather enjoy a film with a strong story as opposed to great action and special effects.  While there's nothing necessarily wrong with these parts of this A&E; production, the Pitt vehicle excels in those areas.  If you are a Pitt fan, or if you value a film based on how much action there is, then this is not for you.  You will enjoy ""Troy"" more than ""Helen of Troy.""There are many similarities between the two productions, beyond that of using the same source material.  Each of them chose to demythologize the story, removing Homer's use of the gods as active characters in the story.  Each also continues the long show business tradition of presenting classical characters as if they all had British accents.  Each retains the Greek tragedy aspect of the story, without tacking on a happy ending of some sort.From there, however, the productions diverge noticeably.  The character of Achilles, played with depth by Pitt in the theatrical film, is here more akin to what I understand is the way Homer originally presented him:  A bloodthirsty, single-minded gloryhound warmonger, Pitt's version of Achilles was as a more complex and conflicted individual who was central to that film's storyline.  In ""Helen of Troy"" he is a secondary character played by a bald actor who will never be accused of looking nearly as attractive as Pitt.But that suits the story, which actually revolves around the title character, the Aegean kings who have sworn to defend King Menelaeus's right to her, and Prince Paris and the royal family of Troy, who unwisely welcomed Helen into their midst.In this production Agamemnon and his brother are much younger, more vital men, and Achilles has no quarrel with them as he did in the Pitt vehicle.  Also Paris is not presented as a wimpy loser as he was when Orlando Bloom portrayed him in the theatrical film, but rather as valiant but less gifted warrior who is betrayed.  He even has a scene with Helen's husband wherein we see that both characters have far more depth than the short shrift given them in the Pitt vehicle.This production, overall, is for those who became interested in this ancient tale because of the Pitt vehicle, or are just keen to know more about the legends of Achilles' heel, the Trojan horse, and Helen of Troy, the face that launched a thousand ships.And by the way, the role of Helen here is a thousand times more interesting than portrayed by Diane Kruger in the Pitt vehicle.  There is also some welcome backstory that helps us understand why she finds her husband so distasteful, and a more complete ending to the tale.  That's ultimately why I find this version so satisfying:  There is much more story here, except as relates to the character of Achilles, who got so much screen time in the Pitt vehicle.  This story makes more sense, is generally better acted all the way around, and, unless your tastes run solely to nonstop battle scenes, does not drag at all for its three-hour length.  Good job.",5,Superior to the Pitt vehicle in almost every way,1095897600,"09 23, 2004",2004,3191,"['review', 'perspective', 'having', 'seen', 'big', 'bucks', 'film', 'Troy', 'starring', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'itself.The', 'remarkably', 'uneven', 'film', 'Troy', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'enjoy', 'film', 'strong', 'story', 'opposed', 'great', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'nothing', 'necessarily', 'wrong', 'parts', 'A', 'E', 'production', 'Pitt', 'vehicle', 'excels', 'areas', 'are', 'Pitt', 'fan', 'value', 'film', 'based', 'how', 'much', 'action', 'then', 'not', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Troy', 'more', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'are', 'many', 'similarities', 'two', 'productions', 'using', 'same', 'source', 'material', 'chose', 'demythologize', 'story', 'removing', 'Homer', 'use', 'gods', 'active', 'characters', 'story', 'also', 'long', 'show', 'business', 'tradition', 'presenting', 'classical', 'characters', 'had', 'British', 'accents', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'aspect', 'story', 'tacking', 'happy', 'ending', 'sort.From', 'there', 'however', 'productions', 'diverge', 'noticeably', 'character', 'Achilles', 'played', 'depth', 'Pitt', 'theatrical', 'film', 'here', 'more', 'akin', 'what', 'understand', 'way', 'Homer', 'originally', 'presented', 'bloodthirsty', 'single-minded', 'gloryhound', 'warmonger', 'Pitt', 'version', 'Achilles', 'was', 'more', 'complex', 'conflicted', 'individual', 'who', 'was', 'central', 'film', 'storyline', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'secondary', 'character', 'played', 'bald', 'actor', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'accused', 'looking', 'nearly', 'as', 'attractive', 'Pitt.But', 'suits', 'story', 'actually', 'title', 'character', 'Aegean', 'kings', 'who', 'have', 'sworn', 'defend', 'King', 'Menelaeus', 'right', 'Prince', 'Paris', 'royal', 'family', 'Troy', 'who', 'unwisely', 'welcomed', 'Helen', 'midst.In', 'production', 'Agamemnon', 'brother', 'are', 'much', 'younger', 'more', 'vital', 'men', 'Achilles', 'quarrel', 'did', 'Pitt', 'vehicle', 'Also', 'Paris', 'not', 'presented', 'wimpy', 'loser', 'was', 'when', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'portrayed', 'theatrical', 'film', 'rather', 'valiant', 'less', 'gifted', 'warrior', 'who', 'betrayed', 'even', 'scene', 'Helen', 'husband', 'wherein', 'see', 'characters', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'depth', 'short', 'shrift', 'given', 'Pitt', 'vehicle.This', 'production', 'overall', 'who', 'became', 'interested', 'ancient', 'tale', 'Pitt', 'vehicle', 'are', 'just', 'keen', 'know', 'more', 'legends', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'Trojan', 'horse', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'face', 'launched', 'thousand', 'ships.And', 'way', 'role', 'Helen', 'here', 'thousand', 'times', 'more', 'interesting', 'portrayed', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Pitt', 'vehicle', 'also', 'welcome', 'backstory', 'understand', 'why', 'husband', 'so', 'distasteful', 'more', 'complete', 'ending', 'tale', 'ultimately', 'why', 'find', 'version', 'so', 'satisfying', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'here', 'relates', 'character', 'Achilles', 'who', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Pitt', 'vehicle', 'story', 'more', 'sense', 'generally', 'better', 'acted', 'way', 'tastes', 'run', 'solely', 'nonstop', 'battle', 'scenes', 'not', 'drag', 'three-hour', 'length', 'Good', 'job']",Helen of Troy
618858,AB34G6VKP28L,B00005JMH8,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[1, 3]","Two worlds waged war over her beauty, and she brought an empire to its knees.This enthralling television series takes us into the world of Helen of Troy, the woman ""whose face launched a thousand ships."" The story begins in the royal palace of Troy as a baby's first cries pierce the evening. The Queen has just given birth to her second child when her first, Cassandra, known for having visions and dreams, comes screaming into the room. ""Kill him!"" she cries. ""Kill him! If he lives, Troy will burn!"" Because she deemed the child male before even the doctors knew, her father (John Rhys-Davies) takes her words as truth. He orders the court council to take the baby boy to the tallest mountaintop and throw him off the cliffs. The man is unable to murder an innocent child and instead leaves him there. The child is found by a local goat farmer, who calls him Paris.Many years later, Paris (Matthew Marsden) is a grown man who loathes the brutality of Troy and longs for a beautiful woman. He is visited in a vision by three of the goddesses, who offer him either riches beyond comparison, power above all other, or Aphrodite... beauty of the ages, found in the form of a neighboring kingdom's younger princess, Helen (Sienna Guillory). He sees her face, and she witnesses him in the waters of a costal village. Helen's older sister is being married to Agamemnon (Rufus Sewell), heir of yet another kingdom. When his eyes fall upon Helen, Agamemnon sees only great beauty. Aware of her increasing lure over men, Helen flees the courtyard and is kidnapped by vagabonds. Instead of harming her, the captors treat her like royalty. She comes to love her kidnapper just in time to see him perish at the hand of her brother, who is also fatally wounded. Her father calls her a curse upon all men who bear her company, and offers her willingly to any kingdom.Paris has journeyed to Troy in order to fight in the games and win back the bull the king's captain of the guard has stolen as a prize. Cassandra (Emilia Fox) recognizes him as the child who should have perished long ago. His parents are overcome and welcome him into the palace, where he is groomed as heir to the throne. When Agamemnon's younger brother makes his claim on Helen, Paris is sent as an ambassador to discuss various land treaties. The same day she is paraded before his royal court, Paris arrives. They recognize one another from the vision they shared so many years before. Their friendship will become dangerous and ultimately lead all Roman kingdoms to war against Troy for the recovery of a queen and the defeat of an empire. Some are motivated by greed, others by lust, yet through it all the passion of Helen and Paris burns brightly. Taken at face value, this is a stunning network adaptation. The filming is more breathtaking than anything I've seen in Hollywood. They use unique camera angles and close-ups in order to build tension and imply great drama.One of the finest moments is when Cassandra realizes that the young man fighting her younger brother (Daniel Lapaine) is the child she ordered should be executed. The acting is incredible... everyone reacts with great feeling and passion and are given a fantastic script to work with. Even if you know nothing of Troy, you immediately understand the motivations behind everyone's actions. The ""casting of lots"" for Helen, her kidnapping, even the fabled Trojan horse. With a fantastic cast behind it, the production team went all out to recreate a believable empire of splendor. Various palaces and courtyards are constructed in breathtaking beauty. Most of the computer animation cannot be told from the real thing.

618861,A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0,B00005JMH8,"Deb Nam-Krane ""dnkboston""","[7, 9]","This story does a lot of things correctly (which shocked me, because it was USA original production).  With their modest budget, the producers/writers were able to convey a lot of the important points in the Helen myth: Helen is kidnapped by Theseus and rescued by her brothers (although in the original she has another brother named Castor, and that isn't how they or Theseus die); Helen's suitors come to an agreement to protect the man who wins her (although it was Odysseus who suggested the idea to Tyndareus and then received Penelope's hand in marriage); Clytemnaestra is married to the powerful, ruthless Agamemnon and becomes a devoted mother (but they leave out that 1) she was married and a mother before and 2) he killed the first husband and child); Paris is left to die in a field at the urging of a prophecy to Priam (but Cassandra was not the prophet, she was his twin, and Priam also had about 20 children aside from Hector, Cassandra and Paris).They also hit some of the subtle points that the myth implies but doesn't state- Helen is a trophy bride and was justified in her desire to leave a loveless marriage.  Also, I rather liked the treatment of Achilles- he was a vicious, vengeful, larger than life brute in the Iliad, and I think it was fitting that they chose to portray him with an actor that looked very much like a professional wrestler.  While the movie skipped a lot of the material leading up to Agamemnon's death at Clytemnaestra's hands, they included enough to make it clear and even sympathetic.  In addition, the movie makes very little use or mention of the gods- something which might alienate viewers.  Finally, the implication that the war was not actually about Helen but about domination of Troy makes the movie more relevant to today's cynical audiences who aren't looking for a fairytale.Unfortunately, some of the licenses they took really didn't work.  Agamemnon's quest is for power, and he has a huge ego that makes at times a liability to the war, notably with Achilles.  In this movie, Agamemnon comes off as a reasonably respected leader who is motivated as much by his lust for Helen (more below) as he is his desire for power.  And while Agamemnon is not supposed to be a hero, having him be the primary antagonist (he kills Paris?!?) makes him almost cartoonish.Paris and Menelaus are far too sympathetic.  In the literature, Menelaus is angry and motivated by revenge.  Here, he is his brother's wimpy underling.  Paris is also almost always portrayed as the spineless coward, more suited to the world of goddesses, comfort and beauty than battles and war.  Here, he is noble and brave, protective of Helen (vs. protective of his ownership of her).Finally, what really sickened me was the way Helen (and the actress who played her) were so objectified in the movie.  Yes, Helen was supposed to be desired because of her beauty, but NOWHERE in any literary treatment I have seen is she made to parade around naked in front of the kings of Greece.  The Agamemnon/Helen dynamic is another &quot;development&quot; entirely new to this version of the story, and as the denouement is the rape of Helen as Troy falls (while Menelaus powerlessly looks on), it adds nothing of value to the story.  I'm all for artistic license, but only when it propels the story, not when it feeds into juvenile fantasies.",3,A promising start with a revolting ending,1070841600,"12 8, 2003",2003,3354,"['story', 'lot', 'things', 'correctly', 'shocked', 'was', 'USA', 'original', 'production', 'modest', 'budget', 'producers/writers', 'were', 'able', 'convey', 'lot', 'important', 'points', 'Helen', 'myth', 'Helen', 'kidnapped', 'Theseus', 'rescued', 'brothers', 'original', 'brother', 'named', 'Castor', ""n't"", 'how', 'Theseus', 'die', 'Helen', 'suitors', 'come', 'agreement', 'protect', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'Odysseus', 'who', 'suggested', 'idea', 'Tyndareus', 'then', 'received', 'Penelope', 'hand', 'marriage', 'Clytemnaestra', 'married', 'powerful', 'ruthless', 'Agamemnon', 'devoted', 'mother', 'leave', 'out', '1', 'was', 'married', 'mother', '2', 'killed', 'first', 'husband', 'child', 'Paris', 'left', 'die', 'field', 'urging', 'prophecy', 'Priam', 'Cassandra', 'was', 'not', 'prophet', 'was', 'twin', 'Priam', 'also', 'had', '20', 'children', 'aside', 'Hector', 'Cassandra', 'Paris', '.They', 'also', 'hit', 'subtle', 'points', 'myth', 'implies', ""n't"", 'state-', 'Helen', 'trophy', 'bride', 'was', 'justified', 'desire', 'leave', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'Also', 'rather', 'liked', 'treatment', 'Achilles-', 'was', 'vicious', 'vengeful', 'larger', 'life', 'brute', 'Iliad', 'think', 'was', 'fitting', 'chose', 'portray', 'actor', 'looked', 'very', 'much', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'movie', 'skipped', 'lot', 'material', 'leading', 'up', 'Agamemnon', 'death', 'Clytemnaestra', 'hands', 'included', 'enough', 'make', 'clear', 'even', 'sympathetic', 'addition', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'use', 'mention', 'gods-', 'something', 'might', 'alienate', 'viewers', 'Finally', 'implication', 'war', 'was', 'not', 'actually', 'Helen', 'domination', 'Troy', 'movie', 'more', 'relevant', 'today', 'cynical', 'audiences', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'fairytale.Unfortunately', 'licenses', 'took', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Agamemnon', 'quest', 'power', 'huge', 'ego', 'times', 'liability', 'war', 'notably', 'Achilles', 'movie', 'Agamemnon', 'off', 'reasonably', 'respected', 'leader', 'who', 'motivated', 'much', 'lust', 'Helen', 'more', 'below', 'desire', 'power', 'Agamemnon', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'hero', 'having', 'be', 'primary', 'antagonist', 'Paris', 'almost', 'cartoonish.Paris', 'Menelaus', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'sympathetic', 'literature', 'Menelaus', 'angry', 'motivated', 'revenge', 'Here', 'brother', 'wimpy', 'underling', 'Paris', 'also', 'almost', 'always', 'portrayed', 'spineless', 'coward', 'more', 'suited', 'world', 'goddesses', 'comfort', 'beauty', 'battles', 'war', 'Here', 'noble', 'brave', 'protective', 'Helen', 'vs.', 'protective', 'ownership', '.Finally', 'what', 'really', 'sickened', 'was', 'way', 'Helen', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'were', 'so', 'objectified', 'movie', 'Yes', 'Helen', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'desired', 'beauty', 'NOWHERE', 'literary', 'treatment', 'have', 'seen', 'made', 'parade', 'around', 'naked', 'front', 'kings', 'Greece', 'Agamemnon/Helen', 'dynamic', 'quot', 'development', 'quot', 'entirely', 'new', 'version', 'story', 'denouement', 'rape', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'Menelaus', 'powerlessly', 'nothing', 'value', 'story', ""'m"", 'artistic', 'license', 'only', 'when', 'story', 'not', 'when', 'juvenile', 'fantasies']",Helen of Troy

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[11, 13]","As there are few things more distasteful than a badly-done rendition of an epic story, this effort at re-creating the Homeric world is very refreshing and engrossing.  The production value of this ambitious venture is top-notch;  I can't think of why anyone who has ever read Homer would be disappointed with this DVD.The novice might be inclined to believe that the film is taken straight from the ILIAD.  In fact, precious few scenes are actually in Homer's poem.  The majority of the action depicted happens either before or after the ILIAD.The episode of Helen being abducted by Theseus is based on an obscure myth.  The major differences between the myth &amp; the story in the DVD are (1):  Helen is just a child in the myth (as opposed to a young woman in the film).  (2):  In the myth, Theseus is not killed by Helen's brothers when they come to fetch her back.Given the fact that Homer's poem is saturated with the interaction of gods &amp; goddesses, it comes as a surprise that the roles of the gods are muted in this story.  Aside from the cameo of the 3 goddesses in the abbreviated JUDGMENT OF PARIS at the beginning of the tale, the entire Greek pantheon is basically left out of the remainder of the story.The acting is quite good.  The men, for the most part, fit their roles as Greeks &amp; Trojans.  Sienna Guillory plays a credible Helen &amp; I thought she portrayed a believable young, innocent girl who gets in way over her head.  Obviously, no matter who they pick to play &quot;the most beautiful woman who ever lived,&quot; there will ALWAYS be some people who are unhappy w/the selection.  That  Guillory is in possession of acting skills is helpful;  hiring a supermodel who can't act would have been a complete disaster.Making Paris into some sort of quasi-hero was exceptionally bold and radical.  It is something that would have been apt to strike the ancient Greeks as strange.  It was a clever bit how they re-arranged the infamous duel between Menelaous and Paris.That said, what the makers of this film did was very Greek in its manner.  In Greek tragedies different characters are portrayed in a variety of ways, depending on the point that tradgedian was attempting to convey.  This was true even in different plays by the SAME author.This DVD is HIGHLY recommended to anyone who has read Homer, wants to read Homer or is even slightly interested in the mythology of the ancient Greeks.  It blends some history and mythology (such as the reason that Troy was attacked) and does a balanced job of telling Homer's story.

Achilles hated Agamemnon and had refused to fight for him, he killed Hector as revenge for Hector slaying in battle Achilles cousin Patroclus (not mentioned in this film).The entire characters of Achilles and Hector are completely warped, with Hector being reduced to a paltry minor entity.The movie is somewhat redeemed at the end by the slaying of Agamemnon by his wife Clytemnestra (Katie Blake) at the end of the movie, in revenge for Agamemnon's sacrifice of their little daughter and his rape of Helen, as well as Menelaus' mercy and forgiveness of Helen.Like the Wolfgang Petersen 2004 version Troy, there are aspects that are both stunning and that take too many liberties.It is however a visual feast and has a good and compelling story flow.",3,"First part excellent, second part lacking.",1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,2001,"['first', 'part', 'party', 'beautiful', 'think', 'one', 'real', 'sense', 'story', 'Helen', 'very', 'attractive', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'beautiful', 'child', 'bride', 'full', 'life', 'youthful', 'passion', 'forced', 'marriage', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'father', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'King', 'Menelaus', 'Sparta', 'James', 'Callis', 'scene', 'where', 'paraded', 'naked', 'front', 'Menelaus', 'cronies', 'something', 'what', 'really', 'was-', 'beautiful', 'pawn', 'powerful', 'selfish', 'usually', 'ruthless', 'men', 'Menelaus', 'will', 'later', 'show', 'Helen', 'gentler', 'more', 'merciful', 'side', 'character.The', 'prophecy', 'Cassandra', 'Emilia', 'Fox', 'beginning', 'very', 'powerful', 'Bettina', 'Paris', 'also', 'phenomenal', 'beginning', 'movie', 'young', 'Cassandra', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'elopement', 'Paris', 'Matthew', 'Marsden', 'Helen', 'indeed', 'done', 'powerfully', 'romantic', 'way.Agamemnon', 'portrayed', 'perfectly', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'greedy', 'ruthless', 'scheming', 'power-hungry', 'villain.The', 'portrayal', 'Helen', 'fate', 'opinion', 'faultless', 'story', 'actual', 'Trojan', 'War', 'butchered', 'recognition.Achilles', 'Joe', 'Montana', 'was', 'not', 'Agamemnon', 'mindless', 'goon', 'actually', 'quite', 'ironic', 'killing', 'Hector', 'Daniel', 'Lapaine', 'tribute', 'Agamemnon', 'Achilles', 'hated', 'Agamemnon', 'had', 'refused', 'fight', 'killed', 'Hector', 'revenge', 'Hector', 'slaying', 'battle', 'Achilles', 'cousin', 'Patroclus', 'not', 'mentioned', 'film', '.The', 'entire', 'characters', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'are', 'completely', 'warped', 'Hector', 'being', 'reduced', 'paltry', 'minor', 'entity.The', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'redeemed', 'end', 'slaying', 'Agamemnon', 'wife', 'Clytemnestra', 'Katie', 'Blake', 'end', 'movie', 'revenge', 'Agamemnon', 'sacrifice', 'little', 'daughter', 'rape', 'Helen', 'as', 'well', 'Menelaus', 'mercy', 'forgiveness', 'Helen.Like', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', '2004', 'version', 'Troy', 'are', 'aspects', 'are', 'stunning', 'take', 'too', 'many', 'liberties.It', 'however', 'visual', 'feast', 'good', 'compelling', 'story', 'flow']",Helen of Troy

J.""","[3, 4]","Like most movies adapted from books or stories, film makers will take some liberties with the storyline and place their personal marks. As long as there is the attempt to stay true to the tone of the original work, you can still carry the story as it was intended to be told.That being said, I think that this film was a very good depiction of the Trojan war.  The director chose to center the theme around Helen and her effect on the men in this film.  Her character is meant to be innocent and her spirit a free one. It is this quality that makes her unknowlingly so attractve.  Helen slowly begins to realise she is the cause of many troubles including her own unhappiness and soon learns the difference betwen lust and love.  This is why she runs away with Paris to Troy, contrary to the notion that she was stolen.The Greeks have different ideas.  Their prize possession was taken from them by their most hated enemy and what better catalyst to serve as Agamemnon's reason for war on Troy.  Paris came to Sparta to talk peace, a result power hungry Amagemnon had no interest in.  His desire for Troy is more than his desire for Helen.  In this battle between lust and love, lust wins and brings havoc on all.  The Gods and Goddesses are lauging again at their fateful mischief despite Cassandra's visions of warning.The production sets were pretty good, but the armor and battle sequences are not quite as impressive as we've seen in other movies.  This is supposed to be the greatest battle of all time, yet not much emphasis is placed on the battle at all.The acting, on the other hand, was very well done.  There are lots of characters and names thrown around, familial relations here and there.  It can get confusing if you're not familiar with the Iliad. Each character's personal agenda tied nicely into the storyline leading to the war on Troy.  Rufus Sewell made a marvellous Amagemnon.I will admit Helen should have been played by someone with stunning beauty.  Sienna Guillory is pretty but a bit on the thin side and doesn't have that face that would launch a thousand ships.  She does, however, capture Helen's innocence and sensual spirit.On the whole a good story telling movie and a must-see before watching the Brad Pitt version of Troy to get a clear background behind this great war.",4,Quite Impressive,1084579200,"05 15, 2004",2004,2306,"['most', 'movies', 'adapted', 'books', 'stories', 'film', 'makers', 'will', 'take', 'liberties', 'storyline', 'place', 'personal', 'marks', 'As', 'long', 'attempt', 'stay', 'true', 'tone', 'original', 'work', 'can', 'still', 'carry', 'story', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'told.That', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'depiction', 'Trojan', 'war', 'director', 'chose', 'center', 'theme', 'Helen', 'effect', 'men', 'film', 'character', 'meant', 'be', 'innocent', 'spirit', 'free', 'one', 'quality', 'unknowlingly', 'so', 'attractve', 'Helen', 'slowly', 'realise', 'cause', 'many', 'troubles', 'including', 'own', 'unhappiness', 'soon', 'difference', 'betwen', 'lust', 'love', 'why', 'away', 'Paris', 'Troy', 'contrary', 'notion', 'was', 'stolen.The', 'Greeks', 'have', 'different', 'ideas', 'prize', 'possession', 'was', 'taken', 'most', 'hated', 'enemy', 'what', 'better', 'catalyst', 'serve', 'Agamemnon', 'reason', 'war', 'Troy', 'Paris', 'came', 'Sparta', 'talk', 'peace', 'result', 'power', 'hungry', 'Amagemnon', 'had', 'interest', 'desire', 'Troy', 'more', 'desire', 'Helen', 'battle', 'lust', 'love', 'lust', 'wins', 'havoc', 'Gods', 'Goddesses', 'are', 'lauging', 'again', 'fateful', 'mischief', 'Cassandra', 'visions', 'warning.The', 'production', 'sets', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'armor', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'impressive', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'supposed', 'be', 'greatest', 'battle', 'time', 'yet', 'not', 'much', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'battle', 'all.The', 'acting', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'lots', 'characters', 'names', 'thrown', 'around', 'familial', 'relations', 'here', 'there', 'can', 'get', 'confusing', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Iliad', 'character', 'personal', 'agenda', 'tied', 'nicely', 'storyline', 'leading', 'war', 'Troy', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'made', 'marvellous', 'Amagemnon.I', 'will', 'admit', 'Helen', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'someone', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'pretty', 'bit', 'thin', 'side', ""n't"", 'have', 'face', 'would', 'launch', 'thousand', 'ships', 'however', 'capture', 'Helen', 'innocence', 'sensual', 'spirit.On', 'whole', 'good', 'story', 'telling', 'movie', 'must-see', 'watching', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'version', 'Troy', 'get', 'clear', 'background', 'great', 'war']",Helen of Troy

However, that DOES NOT make up for the egregious liberties taken with the legend, though there were some-very few, i might add-interesting moments, including -SPOILER!!!- Agamemmnon's watery demise at the hands of Clytemnestra. Achilles, a major character in the legend, looks more like a WWF wrestler and a one-dimensional selfish s.o.b. rather than the noble warrior depicted in ""The Iliad"" and Wolfgang Petersen's epic film ""Troy."" Sienna Guillory was okay, but nowhere near as good as Diane Kruger as Helen, Prince Hector was sadly reduced to a bit part, and though John Rhy-Davis was adequate as King Priam, his role was also much reduced in the film, and Peter O'Toole was much better.

While the USA TV mini-series, HELEN OF TROY, takes some unusual and interesting liberties with the classic story, it provides an entertaining version of the Greek myth.  Mainly told from Helen's point of view (with husband Menelaus providing the introduction and epilogue), HELEN OF TROY grabs your attention with some unique twists.  For starters, the relationship between brothers Menelaus (James Callis) and high-king Agammemnon (Rufus Sewell) is made into a very complex one, with the basically decent Menelaus being bullied and over-shadowed by his nasty and conniving brother.  Both of the major warriors of ""the Iliad,"" Achilles (the bald Joe Montana, who is NOT the the 49ers quarterback of the same name) and Hector (Daniel Lapaine) are given almost minor roles in the epic, with Achilles being no more than a burly brute and Hector as a less-than-superhuman warrior at best.  Many other major characters of the story are dropped completely.  For example, did anyone else wonder where Pollux's twin brother Castor disappeared to?.  Also, events are compressed to fit a reduced time-frame.As for the acting, the range falls between very good to merely servicable. As the title role, Sienna Guillory is pretty enough, though not nearly ravishing enough to warrant launching ""a thousand ships."" Also, Guillory's Helen comes across as a bit of a pill with her character's tendency to whine.  Matthew Marsden fares better as a likable and sympathetic Paris, Helen's lover.  James Callis is solid in the somewhat thankless role of the cuckholded Menelaus.  Emelia Fox is perfect as the prophetess, Cassandra, who is doomed to foretell the truth...but is never  believed. John Rhys-Davies is powerful as King Priam of Troy, while Rufus Sewell turns in the top performance as the black-hearted Agamemmnon.Overall, despite its weak points, HELEN OF TROY generates our interest over its 3 hour length and is definitely one of the better adaptations of Greek myth out there on film today.

The movie does not faithfully follow the original, rather it is INSPIRED by Homer's Iliad, and therefore has a great deal of flaws and deviations from the original story. One could list one after another the discrepancies that occur, and for those that have read/studied the Iliad, it is common knowledge that the list would be very long indeed, some will say too long...From this very long list there are several important alteration such as when Achilles fought and killed Hector following Patroklos' (Achilles' close friend's) death at the hands of the Trojan prince.  Patroklos is nowhere to be seen in the movie!!!  Achilles himself is played by an actor who is totally bold (???), when according to the Iliad he should be blond, not to mention that he has the appearance of a northern barbarian (???) rather than that of a Greek hero.  Even though this is Hollywood and one should be more flexible and lenient when dealing with adaptations, one should also keep in mind that this is the Iliad in question and not some modern twentieth century novel.In addition, all throughout the film one gets the feeling, on and off, that they are watching an extended episode of Xena as a result of the Xena-style setting, action and at times even Xena-style dialogues.Moreover, ALL the actors after 10 YEARS of WAR had not changed one bit from the opening scenes.  They looked EXACTLY as they did at the beginning of the film!Furthermore, the deaths of Paris and Hector as well as the fall of Troy instead of being played out in full, are crammed together in a few minutes at the end.Lastly, special emphasis must be made on the point that the Trojans are Greeks too, with the same language, the same gods, the same names etc, which is another thing that the movie does not stress enough, leaving relations between the combatants vague/open to any theory.Therefore, the only real problem arises when the majority of people (and most people have NOT read the Iliad) who see the movie start believing that events happened the way the movie depicts/portrays and not the way they actually did occur according to Homer.  Consequently, due to the distortion of Homer's work, the movie poses a very serious danger of producing armies of misinformed people who think they know Homer when they really do not.  That is NOT good!On the positive side, the movie is action packed, the costumes are excellent, and the special effects are very good!  The acting, however, is average.  John Rhys-Davies, and the rest of the actors have done a fair job of providing an entertaining film.  The actors playing Menelaus and Achilles could not have been more off.  Helen (Sienna Guillory) was very good looking and had her share of ""light"", nude scenes, but acting is not her really strong point...Hopefully, more movies will be made set in the ancient times, as the demand for them is definitely there.",3,Mixed emotions from Greece,1102896000,"12 13, 2004",2004,3018,"['Helen', 'Troy', 'movie', 'life', 'director', 'version', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Homer', 'story', 'Trojan', 'War', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'not', 'faithfully', 'follow', 'original', 'rather', 'INSPIRED', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'therefore', 'great', 'deal', 'flaws', 'deviations', 'original', 'story', 'One', 'could', 'list', 'one', 'discrepancies', 'occur', 'have', 'read/studied', 'Iliad', 'common', 'knowledge', 'list', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'long', 'indeed', 'will', 'say', 'too', 'long', 'very', 'long', 'list', 'are', 'several', 'important', 'alteration', 'such', 'when', 'Achilles', 'fought', 'killed', 'Hector', 'following', 'Patroklos', 'Achilles', 'close', 'friend', 'death', 'hands', 'Trojan', 'prince', 'Patroklos', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'movie', 'Achilles', 'played', 'actor', 'who', 'totally', 'bold', 'when', 'according', 'Iliad', 'should', 'be', 'blond', 'not', 'mention', 'appearance', 'northern', 'barbarian', 'rather', 'Greek', 'hero', 'Even', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'flexible', 'lenient', 'when', 'dealing', 'adaptations', 'one', 'should', 'also', 'keep', 'mind', 'Iliad', 'question', 'not', 'modern', 'twentieth', 'century', 'addition', 'film', 'one', 'feeling', 'are', 'watching', 'extended', 'episode', 'Xena', 'result', 'Xena-style', 'setting', 'action', 'times', 'even', 'Xena-style', 'dialogues.Moreover', 'actors', '10', 'YEARS', 'WAR', 'had', 'not', 'changed', 'one', 'bit', 'opening', 'scenes', 'looked', 'EXACTLY', 'did', 'beginning', 'film', 'Furthermore', 'deaths', 'Paris', 'Hector', 'as', 'well', 'fall', 'Troy', 'instead', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'full', 'are', 'crammed', 'together', 'few', 'minutes', 'end.Lastly', 'special', 'emphasis', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'point', 'Trojans', 'are', 'Greeks', 'too', 'same', 'language', 'same', 'gods', 'same', 'names', 'etc', 'thing', 'movie', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'leaving', 'relations', 'combatants', 'vague/open', 'theory.Therefore', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'arises', 'when', 'majority', 'people', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'NOT', 'read', 'Iliad', 'who', 'see', 'movie', 'start', 'believing', 'events', 'happened', 'way', 'movie', 'depicts/portrays', 'not', 'way', 'actually', 'did', 'occur', 'according', 'Homer', 'Consequently', 'due', 'distortion', 'Homer', 'work', 'movie', 'very', 'serious', 'danger', 'producing', 'armies', 'misinformed', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'know', 'Homer', 'when', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'NOT', 'good', 'positive', 'side', 'movie', 'action', 'packed', 'costumes', 'are', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'however', 'average', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'rest', 'actors', 'have', 'done', 'fair', 'job', 'providing', 'entertaining', 'film', 'actors', 'playing', 'Menelaus', 'Achilles', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'off', 'Helen', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'had', 'share', 'light', 'nude', 'scenes', 'acting', 'not', 'really', 'strong', 'point', 'Hopefully', 'more', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'set', 'ancient', 'times', 'demand', 'definitely', 'there']",Helen of Troy

The scene when Agammemnon crosses the line and makes the choice to kill his own daughter is powerful.  They stick to the original story line for a significant portion of the movie.Overall, it's a great movie.

618879,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B00005JMH8,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[51, 56]","Having enjoyed Homer's &#65533;The Iliad&#65533; and Virgil's &#65533;Aeneid&#65533; and as a long time fan of Greek mythology, I was looking forward with great anticipation to this mini-series.  &#65533;Helen of Troy&#65533; is a creditable follow-up to greek myth-based offerings such as &#65533;The Odyssey&#65533; (starring Armand Assante), &#65533;Clash of the Titans&#65533; and &#65533;Jason and the Argonauts&#65533; (both versions) and is brought to us by USA Networks, which recently released the acclaimed mini-series &#65533;Attila&#65533; (starring Gerard Butler).The first half of the story centers on Helen of Sparta (Sienna Guillory) and Paris of Troy (Matthew Marsden).  It introduces us to Helen&#65533;s family - King Tyndareus, her sister Clytemnestra and brother Pollux (though his twin Castor is nowhere to be found) and shows the abduction of Helen by Thesseus, King of Athens (Stellan Skarsgard).  We are also  introduced to Paris/Alexandros who is fated to cause the destruction of Troy should he live.  On his birth, Prince Alexandros is therefore left on top of  Mount Aida to die but is taken in by a shepherd and raised as his own son (hence, re-named Paris).As a young man, Paris discovers his true heritage and is reconciled with his family - namely, King Priam (John Rhys-Davies), Queen Hecuba (Maryam d&#65533;Abo), Prince Hector (Daniel Lapaine) and Princess Cassandra (Emilia Fox).  Helen marries King Menelaus (James Callis) of Sparta, younger brother to the power-hungry and vicious King Agammemnon (Rufus Sewell), whose thirst for power is so great that he makes the ultimate sacrifice in his quest to become king of the Aegean.  When Helen and Paris meet, fall in love and elope, the stage is set for Agammemnon to use the elopement as an excuse to declare war on Troy.  Those of us who are familiar with tales of ancient Greece know how it all ends, but this adaptation does provide a few surprises and some notable changes to Homer and Virgil&#65533;s tales.Highlights of this mini-series are the memorable performances, attractive cast, high production values and outstanding special effects.  Rufus Sewell (&#65533;Cold Comfort Farm,&#65533; &#65533;The Very Thought of You&#65533; and BBC&#65533;s &#65533;Middlemarch&#65533;), newcomer Matthew Marsden (&#65533;Black Hawk Down&#65533;), Emilia Fox (&#65533;Pride and Prejudice,&#65533; &#65533;The Round Tower&#65533;) and veteran John Rhys-Davies (&#65533;The Lord of the Rings,&#65533; &#65533;Indiana Jones&#65533;) provide great performances.  Kudos goes to Rufus Sewell for his fantastic performance as the hard-hearted and villainous Agammemnon.  Matthew  Marsden and Daniel Lapaine (Prince Hector - though sadly in a much reduced role) are likeable, handsome, charismatic heroes.  The locations in Malta are believable and realistic.  The story itself is compelling and provides a great introduction to those who are unfamiliar with the Trojan War.The mini-series does have its shortcomings. For one, I was not impressed with Sienna Guillory&#65533;s performance as Helen.  To be true, anyone who takes on the role of Helen carries a great deal of weight on her shoulders. After all, very few women can live up to being called &#65533;the most beautiful woman in the world.&#65533;  Though pretty, Seinna's beauty and talent fall a little short of the demands of the role and she sometimes plays Helen as a pouty, simpering little brat.  I was also disappointed at the treatment of Menelaus and Hector. While Menelaus (who barely fights in the book) is treated as this &#65533;kick ...&#65533; warrior, the &#65533;mighty&#65533; Hector (who is the equivalent of &#65533;Gladiator&#65533;s&#65533; Maximus and is one of the greatest warriors in classic literature) actually takes a good beating from his enemies!  Achilles is, at best, a one-dimensional &#65533;he man&#65533; who is all brawn but no brains.All these grievances aside, this is an enjoyable mini-series that deserves to be seen.  I will most likely purchase this when it comes out on DVD.  Those who enjoy a good dose of mythology and ancient/classic tales will no doubt enjoy this.  I am now looking forward even more to the upcoming film version of the Trojan War - &#65533;Troy&#65533; (starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom) - and hope to see a slightly different take on this classic story of love, hate, greed, revenge and honor.",4,An interesting take on the Trojan War.

Who picked this lanky, awkward and only semi-attractive lady to play this role? With all the beautiful actresses and models (who you could have trained for this) why on earth would the casting crew pick this woman to be Helen? I couldn't get into the film more because of her! This woman isn't beautiful at all. She's attractive, but not close to being able to wear the title of Most Beautiful Woman. Please! I know people down the street that are prettier than her!

618884,A35PZTI5VCOBW2,B00005JMH8,Quarx,"[1, 1]","A V-E-R-Y interesting take on the story nobody really knows. Never have I expected less of a movie and gotten more than with this version. This Helen is, in her own pre-Cyclopean-age way, more engaging than all others. This Helen is provocative and devious - and a problem child. The face that launched those ships is brooding and darkly smug. Do not forget she and Menelaus lived happily ever after. The dynamics of what could bring so much distress are intriguing and, up to a point, even logical. Menelaus is played by a younger James Callis (yes, THAT one) probably months before he took on the Baltar role. Oddly, there are moments, too, where the music sounds (prophetically, I mused) like that composed for Galactica.The slaughter of Iphigenia (a likely occurence for those times) concludes part 1 and is the benchmark by which those men who destroyed Troy must be judged not as great warriors but mere butchers. History somewhat supports the fact that some Achaeans (yet to be called Greeks) united to steal and plunder their way through the Eastern Mediterranean around 1250 BC - only to be swept away themselves within a generation, probably by the same violence they incited; the presumed decade-long assault on Troy was a sustained military campaign on small coastal cities and it occupied several generations of warriors (the Trojans were neither Greek, nor Hittite, but likely related to the proto-Latin Thracians, of whom a nation survives North of the Danube today; myth says Aeneas escaped the sack of Troy to go West and establish a Latin, but not Italian, Rome). The characters are almost inverted to our perception of them so far: Agamemnon the determined killer; Paris is the ultimate outsider; Helen the ultimate trophy wife (with an eerie reminder, whilst dressed with head jewels, of Schliemann's own mail-order bride similarly decorated with treasures found at Troy in 1873, ostensibly Helen's own). And we finally get more than a name from Cassandra and visual proof that bringing the Greek Horse inside the walls was a messy procedure.There are a few outstanding lines in an otherwise lame script (""You're a smudge on history's ledger, but you're my brother""), equally balanced by audaciously idiotic references to Byzantium or monkeys in Thrace - geographic tips for the low-information viewer, I suppose. And when was the last time you've seen a real garden in a ""Greek-themed"" movie? British accents are there, Achilles and Hector barely, CGI ships sail too tightly, the walls and towers of Troy are accurately crenelated but the landscape perhaps too steep and the history (or myth) gets seriously off-track in the second half. The rape scene at the end is disturbing. Movie is rated for originality.Michael Wood's In Search of the Trojan War, both book and TV series, is an impressive excursion through the reality of the Iliad, for those so inclined (but Michael, there were no Hungarian celts in 1250 BC). Two scenes in the movie accurately depict javelins as a personal combat weapon and Aechean (bronze) swords breaking at the hilt - bronze was later replaced by quality steel forged by (and purchased from) Thracians living as far as modern Transylvania.",4,This Helen scorches souls with leering eyes!,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,3191,"['V-E-R-Y', 'interesting', 'take', 'story', 'nobody', 'really', 'Never', 'have', 'expected', 'less', 'movie', 'more', 'version', 'Helen', 'own', 'pre-Cyclopean-age', 'way', 'more', 'engaging', 'others', 'Helen', 'provocative', 'devious', 'problem', 'child', 'face', 'launched', 'ships', 'brooding', 'darkly', 'smug', 'Do', 'not', 'forget', 'Menelaus', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'dynamics', 'what', 'could', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'distress', 'are', 'intriguing', 'up', 'point', 'even', 'logical', 'Menelaus', 'played', 'younger', 'James', 'Callis', 'yes', 'THAT', 'one', 'probably', 'months', 'took', 'Baltar', 'role', 'Oddly', 'are', 'moments', 'too', 'where', 'music', 'prophetically', 'mused', 'composed', 'Galactica.The', 'slaughter', 'Iphigenia', 'likely', 'occurence', 'times', 'part', '1', 'benchmark', 'men', 'who', 'destroyed', 'Troy', 'must', 'be', 'judged', 'not', 'great', 'warriors', 'mere', 'butchers', 'History', 'somewhat', 'fact', 'Achaeans', 'yet', 'be', 'called', 'Greeks', 'united', 'steal', 'plunder', 'way', 'Eastern', 'Mediterranean', '1250', 'BC', 'only', 'be', 'swept', 'away', 'generation', 'probably', 'same', 'violence', 'incited', 'presumed', 'decade-long', 'assault', 'Troy', 'was', 'sustained', 'military', 'campaign', 'small', 'coastal', 'cities', 'occupied', 'several', 'generations', 'warriors', 'Trojans', 'were', 'Greek', 'Hittite', 'likely', 'related', 'proto-Latin', 'Thracians', 'whom', 'nation', 'North', 'Danube', 'today', 'Aeneas', 'escaped', 'sack', 'Troy', 'go', 'West', 'establish', 'Latin', 'not', 'Italian', 'Rome', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'inverted', 'perception', 'so', 'far', 'Agamemnon', 'determined', 'killer', 'Paris', 'ultimate', 'outsider', 'Helen', 'ultimate', 'trophy', 'wife', 'eerie', 'reminder', 'whilst', 'dressed', 'head', 'jewels', 'Schliemann', 'own', 'mail-order', 'similarly', 'decorated', 'treasures', 'found', 'Troy', '1873', 'ostensibly', 'Helen', 'own', 'finally', 'get', 'more', 'name', 'Cassandra', 'visual', 'proof', 'bringing', 'Greek', 'Horse', 'walls', 'was', 'messy', 'are', 'few', 'outstanding', 'lines', 'otherwise', 'lame', 'script', ""'re"", 'smudge', 'history', 'ledger', ""'re"", 'brother', 'equally', 'balanced', 'audaciously', 'idiotic', 'references', 'Byzantium', 'monkeys', 'Thrace', 'geographic', 'tips', 'low-information', 'viewer', 'suppose', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'real', 'garden', 'Greek-themed', 'movie', 'British', 'accents', 'are', 'there', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'barely', 'CGI', 'sail', 'too', 'tightly', 'walls', 'towers', 'Troy', 'are', 'accurately', 'crenelated', 'landscape', 'perhaps', 'too', 'steep', 'history', 'myth', 'seriously', 'off-track', 'second', 'half', 'rape', 'scene', 'end', 'disturbing', 'Movie', 'rated', 'originality.Michael', 'Wood', 'Search', 'Trojan', 'War', 'book', 'TV', 'series', 'impressive', 'excursion', 'reality', 'Iliad', 'so', 'inclined', 'Michael', 'were', 'Hungarian', 'celts', '1250', 'BC', 'Two', 'scenes', 'movie', 'accurately', 'depict', 'javelins', 'personal', 'combat', 'weapon', 'Aechean', 'bronze', 'swords', 'breaking', 'hilt', 'bronze', 'was', 'later', 'replaced', 'quality', 'steel', 'forged', 'purchased', 'Thracians', 'living', 'as', 'far', 'modern', 'Transylvania']",Helen of Troy
618885,A3YWKDKT6UAMY,B00005JMH8,Readalots,"[1, 3]","Ronni Kern's 2003 re-write of Homer's epic ""Iliad"" is interesting and entertaining.  Sienna Guilloy, in the title role, plays ""Helen of Troy"" very much like modern Americans want to see the ancient beauty queen... with compassion, concern, gallant heroism, and decorum.  Helen's is an ancient love story retold here in a little over three hours.  (The wretched length of this movie, with two DVDs!, keeps it from earning the fifth star.)John Rhys-Davies and Maryam D'abo give great, if too brief, performances as Troy's King and Queen.  Rufus Sewell is brilliant, and frightening, as the murderous Agamemnon.  And one wants to stand and cheer with the demise of Joe Montana's Achilles at the hands of Matthew Marsden's Paris (both exceptional portrayals!).The best parts of this flick are the beautiful out door settings and battle scenes.  Dramatic rocky cliffs over blue oceans present the impressions of the ancient Aegean.  One feels apart of the Grecian landscape with this movie.In battle, the Greeks would have certainly jumped from their ships into the surf to charge ashore.  The Trojans would have definitely rained down clouds of arrows upon their attackers.  The fighting choreographies here are brilliant and instructive.  The clash of these titans and the melee that follows reflect, from a distance of 4000 year ago, what probably happened.  The Trojan Horse is also very imaginative and convincing (the Greeks would have built it from available materials, as this horse depicts).Purists will correctly say that this screenplay does not present Homer accurately.  But this film never makes that claim- its basic idea is not attributed to the Greek poet.  This film is, rather, for 21st century amusement with an ancient novelistic flavor.

618887,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00005JMH8,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[9, 12]","Homer's ""Iliad"" is perhaps the most famous piece of epic poetry in the world, chronicling the ten year siege of Troy and the actions taken by the brothers Menelaus and Agamemnon to win back Menelaus' wife Helen, stolen from her home by Paris, a prince of Troy.In recreating the tale, the people at Hallmark have taken some liberties in presenting the story, some small and understandable, some large and baffling. Basically, if you're hoping for a loyal representation to Homer's text, this is not the movie to watch: despite the four hour running time a lot of material is omitted, the personalities of some characters are utterly changed, and fabricated events seem to have no real importance.The story actually begins with Paris - his birth and his abandonment, leading up to the famous choice between the three goddesses: with Aphrodite promising the love of the most beautiful woman in the world, and to his reinstating as prince in Troy. In fact, he is given so much attention, that its a little confusing when his character drops somewhat from the action later on. Helen at this time is a reasonably young child (at least that's what everyone around her says - she looks pretty old to me), and is kidnapped by King Theseus, which eventually leads to his and her brother's death. Deemed cursed by her father, she is offered to the kings of neighbouring lands. Through a game of chance, she is given to Menelaus, though the timing could not be worse: soon after arrives a delegation from Troy, bearing with them Prince Paris...In recreating the citadel of Troy and the landscapes of Greece, the film-makers triumph wonderfully: most of the special effects are just as good as one would expect on the big screen, and the scale of the movie is as huge as one would expect. Nifty camera movements, such as the vertical circling of the Trojan Horse to present its collosal size, are amazing, as are the shots of the armies and fleets moving toward Troy.Characterisation suffers a bit, however. Out of everyone, Agamemnon goes from what could potentially be the most sympathetic hero out of everyone, to a mere brute. Through him, the siege does not become a war of pride to retrieve Helen, but to conquer for power and spoils. I love Rufus Sewell, and his grief in sacrificing his daughter is portrayed excellently by the actor (he admits to Helen that she and the city are not worth what he had to do), but the rape of Helen in front of the burning city took things a little too far. Scholars will be disguisted.Paris also, goes from a rather cowardly youth, to every girl's dream: loving, romantic, protective of Helen, and so on. Achilles, Odysseus and Hector's roles are too short to be interesting. Menelaus is perhaps a bit young, rather than an imposing king in his own right, but his character is an intriging one, who is perhaps genuinely in love with Helen, but unable to show it. Two excellently portrayed characters are King Priam (John Rhys-Davis - could you expect anything less from him?) and Cassandra (who ""Pride and Prejudice"" fans will recognise as Georgiana) - her hysteria and terror are perfectly portrayed, as are her horrific visions.But as the title suggests, it is Helen that the movie centres on, and I actually thought a rather good attempt was made to untangle her motivations and character. Tired of being a trophy bride, she seeks out true love, she tries to put an end to the war, she suffers guilt at the deaths of those around her, and seems reasonably perseptive. However, a more accomplished actress was needed to pull off this difficult role, something that new-comer Sienna Guillroy just can't do. Instead the director takes every oppurtunity he can to show off her bare bottom, even if its to the extreme of parading naked in front of an entire room full of soldiers.It almost comes across as a preview to Wolfgang Peterson's epic movie ""Troy"", and so it would have been nice to have included some of the more mystical aspects of the god's involvement in the war, as ""Troy"" is also apparently stripped of their presence. All in all, a good production, but I have no wish to see it a second time.",3,"""The Face that Launched a Thousand Ships""",1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,4135,"['Homer', 'Iliad', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'piece', 'epic', 'poetry', 'world', 'chronicling', 'ten', 'year', 'siege', 'Troy', 'actions', 'taken', 'brothers', 'Menelaus', 'Agamemnon', 'win', 'back', 'Menelaus', 'wife', 'Helen', 'stolen', 'home', 'Paris', 'prince', 'Troy.In', 'recreating', 'tale', 'people', 'Hallmark', 'have', 'taken', 'liberties', 'presenting', 'story', 'small', 'understandable', 'large', 'baffling', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'loyal', 'representation', 'Homer', 'text', 'not', 'movie', 'watch', 'four', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'lot', 'material', 'omitted', 'personalities', 'characters', 'are', 'utterly', 'changed', 'fabricated', 'events', 'seem', 'have', 'real', 'importance.The', 'story', 'actually', 'Paris', 'birth', 'abandonment', 'leading', 'up', 'famous', 'choice', 'three', 'goddesses', 'Aphrodite', 'promising', 'love', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'world', 'reinstating', 'prince', 'Troy', 'fact', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'little', 'confusing', 'when', 'character', 'drops', 'somewhat', 'action', 'later', 'Helen', 'time', 'reasonably', 'young', 'child', 'least', 'what', 'everyone', 'pretty', 'old', 'kidnapped', 'King', 'Theseus', 'eventually', 'brother', 'death', 'Deemed', 'cursed', 'father', 'offered', 'kings', 'neighbouring', 'lands', 'game', 'chance', 'given', 'Menelaus', 'timing', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'worse', 'soon', 'delegation', 'Troy', 'bearing', 'Prince', 'Paris', 'recreating', 'citadel', 'Troy', 'landscapes', 'Greece', 'film-makers', 'triumph', 'wonderfully', 'most', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'big', 'screen', 'scale', 'movie', 'as', 'huge', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Nifty', 'camera', 'movements', 'such', 'vertical', 'circling', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'present', 'collosal', 'size', 'are', 'amazing', 'are', 'shots', 'armies', 'fleets', 'moving', 'Troy.Characterisation', 'bit', 'however', 'everyone', 'Agamemnon', 'what', 'could', 'potentially', 'be', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'hero', 'everyone', 'mere', 'brute', 'siege', 'not', 'become', 'war', 'pride', 'retrieve', 'Helen', 'conquer', 'power', 'spoils', 'love', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'grief', 'sacrificing', 'daughter', 'portrayed', 'excellently', 'actor', 'Helen', 'city', 'are', 'not', 'worth', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'rape', 'Helen', 'front', 'burning', 'city', 'took', 'things', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'Scholars', 'will', 'be', 'disguisted.Paris', 'also', 'rather', 'cowardly', 'youth', 'girl', 'dream', 'loving', 'romantic', 'protective', 'Helen', 'so', 'Achilles', 'Odysseus', 'Hector', 'roles', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'be', 'interesting', 'Menelaus', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'young', 'rather', 'imposing', 'king', 'own', 'right', 'character', 'intriging', 'one', 'who', 'perhaps', 'genuinely', 'love', 'Helen', 'unable', 'show', 'Two', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'are', 'King', 'Priam', 'John', 'Rhys-Davis', 'could', 'expect', 'anything', 'less', 'Cassandra', 'who', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'fans', 'will', 'recognise', 'Georgiana', 'hysteria', 'terror', 'are', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'are', 'horrific', 'visions.But', 'title', 'Helen', 'movie', 'actually', 'thought', 'rather', 'good', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'untangle', 'motivations', 'character', 'Tired', 'being', 'trophy', 'bride', 'out', 'true', 'love', 'put', 'end', 'war', 'guilt', 'deaths', 'reasonably', 'perseptive', 'However', 'more', 'accomplished', 'actress', 'was', 'needed', 'pull', 'off', 'difficult', 'role', 'something', 'new-comer', 'Sienna', 'Guillroy', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Instead', 'director', 'oppurtunity', 'can', 'show', 'off', 'bare', 'bottom', 'even', 'extreme', 'parading', 'naked', 'front', 'entire', 'room', 'full', 'soldiers.It', 'almost', 'across', 'preview', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'epic', 'movie', 'Troy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'mystical', 'aspects', 'god', 'involvement', 'war', 'Troy', 'also', 'apparently', 'stripped', 'presence', 'good', 'production', 'have', 'wish', 'see', 'second', 'time']",Helen of Troy

Great story but I wish I were watching a theatrical release of a tale as great as this&quot;. Though good by television's standard, it looks somewhat cheesy and thrown together. With that said however I soon found myself getting immersed in the movie and not so distracted by it's failings. The backstory on Paris and Helen, though not always accurate was developed nicely and kept my interest. In my eyes this was crucial and a good decision on the part of the producers. I agree with several that Helen could've been more beautiful (I was actually irked by the mediocre actress in the beginning). As the film moved forward however she grew on me. She seemed to have a knack for exhibiting the nuances of her character with a good combination of depth, strength, sensuality and innocence. Paris and the other characters were midland to good but the actor that portrayed Agememnon was pretty outstanding. I'm not crazy about the way that his character was written but the portrayal by Rufus Sewell was moving. Achilles however was a JOKE... he came off like an obnoxius WWF wrestler or some moron from a Mad Max sequel. My biggest issue with the movie creatively was the last half hour. I'll admit that the climax was satisfying but overall it cheapened the legend. It was as if the writers went into overdrive (bringing the film to a level of the absurd) in order to close it.Bottom line: There were a great many cinematic liberties taken with the nature and purpose of several characters. On its own, this movie was still quite entertaining and to me that's what is most important.",3,Not too bad for TV...,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,1647,"['first', 'impression', 'get', 'watching', 'movie', 'quot', 'uggh', 'Great', 'story', 'wish', 'were', 'watching', 'theatrical', 'release', 'tale', 'as', 'great', 'quot', 'good', 'television', 'standard', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'thrown', 'together', 'said', 'however', 'soon', 'found', 'getting', 'immersed', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'distracted', 'failings', 'backstory', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'not', 'always', 'accurate', 'was', 'developed', 'nicely', 'kept', 'interest', 'eyes', 'was', 'crucial', 'good', 'decision', 'part', 'producers', 'agree', 'several', 'Helen', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'beautiful', 'was', 'actually', 'irked', 'mediocre', 'actress', 'beginning', 'film', 'moved', 'forward', 'however', 'grew', 'seemed', 'have', 'knack', 'exhibiting', 'nuances', 'character', 'good', 'combination', 'depth', 'strength', 'sensuality', 'innocence', 'Paris', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'midland', 'good', 'actor', 'portrayed', 'Agememnon', 'was', 'pretty', 'outstanding', ""'m"", 'not', 'crazy', 'way', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'portrayal', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'was', 'moving', 'Achilles', 'however', 'was', 'JOKE', 'came', 'off', 'obnoxius', 'WWF', 'wrestler', 'moron', 'Mad', 'Max', 'sequel', 'biggest', 'issue', 'movie', 'creatively', 'was', 'last', 'half', 'hour', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'climax', 'was', 'satisfying', 'overall', 'cheapened', 'legend', 'was', 'writers', 'went', 'overdrive', 'bringing', 'film', 'level', 'absurd', 'order', 'close', 'it.Bottom', 'line', 'were', 'great', 'many', 'cinematic', 'liberties', 'taken', 'nature', 'purpose', 'several', 'characters', 'own', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'what', 'most', 'important']",Helen of Troy

Let me tell you the real story; I know, I was there."" He (and the directors) are basically saying that this is supposed to be the story from Helen's view. Her story of her undying love and how she launched a thousand ships.  This isn't the Trojan war story we are used to, it's Helen's version. It kinda rough, but it is a totally different view of a classic story.The first time I saw it i was a little diappointed in the inaccuracy, but it kept me on my toes.

Achilis was killed by paris, paris was killed by agamemnon, and at last, Helen came to her Husband! story is really different than a hollywoodic cheap movies like ""TROY""in movies like ""TROY"" they attempt to fool people with brilliant special effects and CGs and the story in such movie usually a loose adaptation of originals! in that movie, they've shown like if stealing some other guys wife cause of love is right, and worse is, that criminal survives at the end and the owner of right, dies! and that shameless thieve becomes a Hero! of course in front of such movies, I rate this one with all of it's problems as 5 star!I can gurantee if you buy this movie, your money will not be wasted!
