730031,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00007K02I,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 0]","Star Maker is the work of 1989 Oscar winningCinema Paradiso (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition)director Giuseppe Tornatore's 1988 film and a young boy who devotion to film.  But here the innocence of Paradiso is offset by a con man, Morelli, who travels through Sicily and convinces villagers they can be a star, earn millions and be successful.  He charges the villagers for the screen test that involves a reading from Gone With the Wind.  But as he films the villagers eager for stardom, and they strike the various poses.  Not only do they recite the scripts, they bare their soul to the camera, while opening up with their confessions.Morelli travels from villages, and is able to convince a policeman to sit for a screen test, plus three bandits end up paying for their screen test.  Star Maker, the con that he is manages to become the admiration of a beautiful woman who worked in a convent.  Slowly as his escapades continue, he, in turn, is due for some conning, this time, by others.The movie is filmed with the sepia-tone color, that light brown haze throughout.  The film is rated R with frontal nudity and sexual acts.  Many characters are known to be non-professionals.  Star Maker is by far, not a comedy.  It's more dramatic.  In 1995, it was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Film, but lost toAntonia's Linefrom the Netherlands. ......Rizzo",5,Anybody can be a star !,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,1357,"['Star', 'Maker', 'work', '1989', 'Oscar', 'winningCinema', 'Paradiso', 'Two-Disc', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'director', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', '1988', 'film', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'devotion', 'film', 'here', 'innocence', 'Paradiso', 'offset', 'con', 'man', 'Morelli', 'who', 'Sicily', 'convinces', 'villagers', 'can', 'be', 'star', 'earn', 'millions', 'be', 'successful', 'villagers', 'screen', 'test', 'reading', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'villagers', 'eager', 'stardom', 'strike', 'various', 'poses', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'recite', 'scripts', 'bare', 'soul', 'camera', 'opening', 'up', 'confessions.Morelli', 'travels', 'villages', 'able', 'convince', 'policeman', 'sit', 'screen', 'test', 'three', 'bandits', 'end', 'up', 'paying', 'screen', 'test', 'Star', 'Maker', 'con', 'become', 'admiration', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'worked', 'convent', 'Slowly', 'escapades', 'continue', 'turn', 'due', 'conning', 'time', 'others.The', 'movie', 'filmed', 'sepia-tone', 'color', 'light', 'brown', 'haze', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'acts', 'Many', 'characters', 'are', 'known', 'be', 'non-professionals', 'Star', 'Maker', 'far', 'not', 'comedy', 'more', 'dramatic', '1995', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'lost', 'toAntonia', 'Linefrom', 'Netherlands', 'Rizzo']",N/A

This time, it's a con man travelling through Sicilly (Tornatorre's birthplace) following the war. As usual, that's the canvas over which Tornatorre paints a critical picture of Italy of the period - full of hope (all towns and village people who want to try out for the movies), satire (the bandits, who also want to pose for the camera) and tragedy (a love story).Tornatorre remains true to his exceptional skill to weave the beautiful, the profane and the ugly - all with a blend of sarcasm, nostalgia and human understanding.This is another wonderful of Tornatore's movies - fans of the director will appreciate it subtle beauty, as will the general viewer who is looking for a richly painted canvas of Italian life in the poor south following the war. For the Tornatore fans, I also recommend ""Everybody's fine"" if you can find it (""Cinema Paradiso"", ""Malena"" and ""The Legend of 1900"" being the more well known of the director's movies).",5,"Post WWII Italy with the good and the bad; , humor, satire and a few tears",1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,1011,"['one', 'Tornatore', 'journeys', 'beutifully', 'filmed', 'narranted', 'time', 'con', 'man', 'travelling', 'Sicilly', 'Tornatorre', 'birthplace', 'following', 'war', 'usual', 'canvas', 'Tornatorre', 'critical', 'picture', 'Italy', 'period', 'full', 'hope', 'towns', 'village', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'try', 'out', 'movies', 'satire', 'bandits', 'who', 'also', 'want', 'pose', 'camera', 'tragedy', 'love', 'story', '.Tornatorre', 'true', 'exceptional', 'skill', 'weave', 'beautiful', 'profane', 'ugly', 'blend', 'sarcasm', 'nostalgia', 'human', 'understanding.This', 'wonderful', 'Tornatore', 'movies', 'fans', 'director', 'will', 'appreciate', 'subtle', 'beauty', 'will', 'general', 'viewer', 'who', 'looking', 'richly', 'painted', 'canvas', 'Italian', 'life', 'poor', 'south', 'following', 'war', 'Tornatore', 'fans', 'also', 'recommend', 'Everybody', 'fine', 'can', 'find', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'Malena', 'Legend', '1900', 'being', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'director', 'movies']",N/A
730034,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00007K02I,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 2]","Joe Morelli (Sergio Castellitto) is a flimflam man who is driving around the rural villages of Sicily shortly after World War II selling potential stardom for fifteen hundred lira.  He has a motion picture camera and loudspeaker on his truck.  As he drives through the villages he broadcasts to the people that he is from the film industry of Roma and he is giving screen tests in order to discover natural talent.He sets up his truck and tent typically in the town square.  His technique is to tell everyone that they have a wonderful face, hidden talent, that they are naturals and diamonds in the rough.  He hands out fliers with some dialogue from ""Gone with the Wind"" on them that they should practice reading before appearing before his camera.  He has discovered that people will fall for his flattery and pay him for the fake screen tests.As we watch the film we discover that people will put their hearts and souls into the experience of appearing before his camera.  They don't just read the lines from Gone with the Wind.  They tell their life stories in miniature.  They bare their hearts and souls to the flimflam man in the hope that someone will hear and see their anguish, their pain, their experience.  To Morelli, who has been to Hollywood and failed, this is just a way to make a lira.  He has a gift for the hustle and is blind to the real emotion that he evokes.A woman believes her teenaged daughter has the talent to make it in the movies.  She begs Morelli to take her to Roma.  She even has sex with him and promises to allow him to be her daughter's first lover.  But Morelli moves on to the next town.  He is stopped by the local police chief, but Morelli manages to flatter him into appearing before his camera and then applauds the chief's performance.  Three highwaymen stop to rob Morelli.  He is able to convince them that Roma longs for their raw talent.  And so on, as he travels over the cobblestones and over the winding roads.Finally he meets beautiful Beata (Tiziana Lodato) who is 15 or 18.  She isn't sure.  She works in the convent, bathing the sick and scrubbing the floors.  She exposes herself to the local tax man to raise the 1500 lira needed for Morelli's screen test.  She is strikingly beautiful from head to toe, and the tax man exclaims, ""You are a statue!"" when he sees her body.  Morelli is reluctant to get involved with someone so young even though she throws herself at him.What happens after this I will not say since it would spoil the film for those who have not seen it.  But watch for the con man to get conned, among other things.  Despite his villainy, there is a sense that Morelli is a man that we can identify with and understand.  I think it is this quality that director Giuseppe Tornatore has developed in his character that carries the film, and Sergio Castellitto whom I saw recently in Non ti muovere (Don't Move) (2004) really becomes the part.Tornatore, who made a splash with the critically acclaimed Cinema Paradiso (1988) wrote the original material here and worked on the script in addition to directing.  While I thought Cinema Paradiso was an excellent film, I liked this one even more.  Both are original works of art, but I found L'uomo delle stelle more engaging.  Particularly striking are the beautiful village scenes, the faces of the people, and the photography of the Sicilian countryside and ruins.",5,"Beautiful, original--an engaging work of art",1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,3387,"['Joe', 'Morelli', 'Sergio', 'Castellitto', 'flimflam', 'man', 'who', 'driving', 'rural', 'villages', 'Sicily', 'shortly', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'selling', 'potential', 'stardom', 'fifteen', 'hundred', 'lira', 'motion', 'picture', 'camera', 'loudspeaker', 'truck', 'villages', 'people', 'film', 'industry', 'Roma', 'giving', 'screen', 'tests', 'order', 'discover', 'natural', 'talent.He', 'up', 'truck', 'tent', 'typically', 'town', 'square', 'technique', 'tell', 'everyone', 'have', 'wonderful', 'face', 'hidden', 'talent', 'are', 'naturals', 'diamonds', 'rough', 'out', 'fliers', 'dialogue', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'should', 'practice', 'reading', 'appearing', 'camera', 'discovered', 'people', 'will', 'fall', 'flattery', 'pay', 'fake', 'screen', 'watch', 'film', 'discover', 'people', 'will', 'put', 'hearts', 'souls', 'experience', 'appearing', 'camera', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'read', 'lines', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'tell', 'life', 'stories', 'miniature', 'bare', 'hearts', 'souls', 'flimflam', 'man', 'hope', 'someone', 'will', 'hear', 'see', 'anguish', 'pain', 'experience', 'Morelli', 'who', 'been', 'Hollywood', 'failed', 'just', 'way', 'make', 'lira', 'gift', 'hustle', 'blind', 'real', 'emotion', 'woman', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'talent', 'make', 'movies', 'begs', 'Morelli', 'take', 'Roma', 'even', 'sex', 'promises', 'allow', 'be', 'daughter', 'first', 'lover', 'Morelli', 'next', 'town', 'stopped', 'local', 'police', 'chief', 'Morelli', 'flatter', 'appearing', 'camera', 'then', 'chief', 'performance', 'Three', 'highwaymen', 'stop', 'rob', 'Morelli', 'able', 'convince', 'Roma', 'longs', 'raw', 'talent', 'so', 'cobblestones', 'winding', 'roads.Finally', 'beautiful', 'Beata', 'Tiziana', 'Lodato', 'who', '15', '18', ""n't"", 'sure', 'convent', 'bathing', 'sick', 'scrubbing', 'floors', 'local', 'tax', 'man', 'raise', '1500', 'lira', 'needed', 'Morelli', 'screen', 'test', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'head', 'toe', 'tax', 'man', 'are', 'statue', 'when', 'body', 'Morelli', 'reluctant', 'get', 'involved', 'someone', 'so', 'young', 'even', 'him.What', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'would', 'spoil', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'watch', 'con', 'man', 'get', 'conned', 'other', 'things', 'villainy', 'sense', 'Morelli', 'man', 'can', 'identify', 'understand', 'think', 'quality', 'director', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', 'developed', 'character', 'film', 'Sergio', 'Castellitto', 'whom', 'saw', 'recently', 'Non', 'ti', 'muovere', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Move', '2004', 'really', 'part.Tornatore', 'who', 'made', 'splash', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', '1988', 'wrote', 'original', 'material', 'here', 'worked', 'script', 'addition', 'directing', 'thought', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'was', 'excellent', 'film', 'liked', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'are', 'original', 'works', 'art', 'found', ""L'uomo"", 'delle', 'stelle', 'more', 'engaging', 'Particularly', 'striking', 'are', 'beautiful', 'village', 'scenes', 'people', 'photography', 'Sicilian', 'countryside', 'ruins']",N/A

SM started out with little main character development which is forgivable, but I never really got a sense of Joe's initial ambition. Things started to move fast village to village as it was obvious that his fraudelent pose as a talent scout was getting out of trouble. The back-to-back-to-back Cop/bandit/mafia scenes were a little to preposterous, unless Tornatore was attempting humor, and if so, it was a little to strung out and ultimately fell flat, and if not, it was just to simple of an illustration of how one's ambition of fame teases them into forgetting their duty or nature. An otherwise touching scene is undermined by a non-existent soundtrack. Not a bad soundtrack, it's Ennio after all. But as a scene unfolded that was intended to imply that Joe was becoming emotionaly engadged with a story, there was no slow attack of any musical score, and with only occasional abprupt close-ups on the subjects faces (no slow zooming in), just made me have to work to become emotionally invoved myself. Frankly, it got boring with every screen test. And when I finally thought Joe has discovered an ominous subject that would tip his/my emotional scale, the apparent War vetran mute approached him that night in the tent asking for a chance to tell his story in front of Joe's camera The scene was gripping me all the way to his turn left/right/center seat while he was preparing to tell what was promising to be a movie direction changing story, only to end in a incoherent regiment chant which Joe, as usual, dismisses as more wasted film. The most compelling part of the film comes at toward the end after Joe comes to terms with his love for Beata, afterwhich he almost immeditely gets arrested,sent to prison, and theyre separated for a long length of time (about 4 minutes movie time). He gets released, looks for her at her old convent, movie theatre, while chowing down, get's told she's in a asylum, finds her, makes a promise, drives away having screen test flashbacks then the credits roll (this literally took all of about 10min). The best part of the movie was the last 13min or so.  Keep in mind, I'm a huge Paridiso and Malena fan, but this Tornatore effort just seemed amature by comparison. Abysmal pacing, horrible English translation, and foregettable characters.

This film captures the soul of the Sicilian post-WWII experience, candidly revealing its peoples joys and sorrows, desires and dreams. The Roman con-man, Morelli, drives through Sicily posing as a film talent scout, charging 1500 lire for a screen test. Traveling through the island's rugged, natural beauty, we observe an agricultural economy, devastated by war and peppered with villages, dominated by a church, piazza and, sometimes, a tiny cinema. This is an older, harder way of life, entrenched in poverty and corruption. And, the faces, the faces stamped by experience, so many, varied and revealing faces: the young and old, rich and poor, crazy, the `seduced and abandoned,' whore, and homosexual; the carabinieri, the mafia, monarchists, anarchists, fascists, communists, and Christian Democrats. Every townsperson has a dream to escape for a better life.Appearance and performance are embedded in Italian culture: All Italians are born actors! Many American viewers may not realize that the possibility of starring or participating in movies was a very real one at the time. By definition, the neo-realist directors used natural settings and non-actors in their films; People were selected for their faces and distinct characteristics. Female, Italian screen stars, such as Magnano, Bose, Lollobrigida, Loren and Cardinale, launched their film careers by winning regional beauty contests. Some auteurs actually preferred non-professional actors to achieve their cinematic visions because they required minimal coaching and could be directed.Rossellini tied a string to a non-professional's toe and tugged on it when he wanted him to move. Fellini was notorious for providing no dialogue until shooting the scene and posing his characters, earning him the moniker of puppet master.So, although Morelli exploits the Sicilians' hopes, he also makes no promises. His crime is not the swindle, but his disrespect for his inadvertent role of confessor. He is imprisoned for violating trust and dishonoring the Sicilian people. Morelli's return to the mainland of Italy is a poignant, poetic, unifying and redemptive montage of Sicilian experience, national identity and humanity.

730041,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00007K02I,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","Ever since Miramax edited the dark last act out of Cinema Paradiso to make a more sentimental film, Giuseppe Tornatore has been written off by many as something of a lightweight. On the face of it, The Star Maker would seem to have the perfect setup for a whimsical comedy of love and redemption as it follows a conman winding his way through post-war Sicily charging the locals 1,500 lira for screen tests he never even bothers to develop. The locals unburden their souls and confess their desperation to him as his camera becomes a confessional, building up a vivid portrait of a desperate place in a desperate time, but it makes little impression on him. In fact, despite the beautiful photography and the `cute' setup as one simple local girl follows him in the hopes of stardom and escape, it's resolutely unsentimental - redemption is denied and he never really learns anything from the experience. Even in the final scenes, he never really gets it.Unfortunately, this very misleadingly packaged DVD appears to be cut by some seven minutes from the Italian version (with one of the most gaping jumps in continuity I've seen in a film since Tom Horn), but there's more than enough surviving to mark this out as a winner, more bitter than sweet.No extras (aside from some promos for other Miramax releases) but the good subtitled 2.35:1 widescreen transfer shows off the ambitious and accomplished camerawork well.",4,Another one of Tornatore's dark fables,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,1418,"['Ever', 'Miramax', 'edited', 'dark', 'last', 'act', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'make', 'more', 'sentimental', 'film', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', 'been', 'written', 'off', 'many', 'something', 'lightweight', 'face', 'Star', 'Maker', 'would', 'seem', 'have', 'perfect', 'setup', 'whimsical', 'comedy', 'love', 'redemption', 'conman', 'winding', 'way', 'post-war', 'Sicily', 'charging', 'locals', '1,500', 'lira', 'screen', 'tests', 'never', 'even', 'bothers', 'develop', 'locals', 'unburden', 'souls', 'confess', 'desperation', 'camera', 'confessional', 'building', 'up', 'vivid', 'portrait', 'desperate', 'place', 'desperate', 'time', 'little', 'impression', 'fact', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'cute', 'setup', 'one', 'simple', 'local', 'girl', 'hopes', 'stardom', 'escape', 'resolutely', 'unsentimental', 'redemption', 'denied', 'never', 'really', 'anything', 'experience', 'Even', 'final', 'scenes', 'never', 'really', 'it.Unfortunately', 'very', 'misleadingly', 'packaged', 'DVD', 'be', 'cut', 'seven', 'minutes', 'Italian', 'version', 'one', 'most', 'gaping', 'jumps', 'continuity', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'Tom', 'Horn', 'more', 'enough', 'surviving', 'mark', 'out', 'winner', 'more', 'bitter', 'sweet.No', 'extras', 'aside', 'promos', 'other', 'Miramax', 'releases', 'good', 'subtitled', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'ambitious', 'accomplished', 'camerawork', 'well']",N/A
