1485198,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B005LAIIFS,Ace Reader,"[2, 5]","""Rise of the Guardians"" is a joyful, fun ride down memory lane!Remember believing in Santa? Being afraid that if you saw him you might die from fright? Or worse he might see you?How about that creepy Tooth Fairy?What's up with her coming into my bedroom at night, in the scary dark, right up to my blissfully sleeping head. Then exchanging money for my gross old tooth?Then there's the Easter Bunny. My parents would take me to the mall where a strange human-shaped, bunny-suited person would give me giant candy eggs to eat.And the Sandman? He was a really weird one. How could he put sand in my eyes at night while I was sleeping and I not know it?Then to me, the most scary was Jack Frost! This guy was used as a formidable weapon by my parents to settle me down at night when I had too much energy to sleep. My parents would teem up, one would go outside to evilly tap on my bedroom window. The other came to my bedroom to quite my screams explaining that Jack Frost was the one tapping outside, and if I wasn't quite and go to sleep, he would get me! I believed them. It worked!Lastly...The Boogeyman. I always believed he lived under my bed. Going to bed each night always involved a huge adrenalin induced running leap from my bedrooms doorway onto my bed so he couldn't reach out and get me! My bed never broke because I was little.As a child all these characters were brought to life by my parents and my own imagination until I became wise enough to know better. Yes, traumatized at a young age, and controlled by fear of the unknown. And yes, you bet I did it to my kids! It worked!These characters are all still here with me to this day. Inside my mind as beloved memory's of my childhood.In ""Rise Of The Guardians"" these same characters (good and bad) are brought magically to life by DreamWorks Animation with brilliant color, design and imagination! Director Peter Ramsey has done a wonderful job creating this magical fantasy. The hero, Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine, aka Captain Kirk!) as the handsome, frosty haired version of the same guy I used to be afraid of as a kid. From now on I will think of this version of him, and I will not be afraid! The villain, The Boogeyman (who all of us are still afraid of to this day!) is also darkly handsome and not too scary for adults or young children alike. The Easter Bunny, Sandman, Tooth Fairy and Santa with his sleigh, are all along for the ride in this wonderfully exciting, fun family film. DreamWorks Animation is glorious! Crystal clear spectacular renderings of a magical, fanciful world. As I watched this movie I could feel the smile on my face the entire time! All the kids in the theater were having a good time laughing throughout this bright, beautiful movie. The story is good, sweet and has heart. By the time the end had arrived I had tears of happiness running down my grinning cheeks! For me this movie hit a home run in the fantasy department and scores a high rating for making me remember my childhood fantasy friends and foes again.Thank you DreamWorks Animation! Highly recommended!

Rise of the Guardians is a fun, behind-the-scenes look at the brotherhood of mythical creatures who protect and bring joy to children. In a way, their protection of kids is for their own good, too: they need the belief of kids in order to survive.There are fun moments in the movie: we learn that the Yeti make the toys at the North Pole, instead of elves. In a funny clip during the end credits, we even learn the one of the Yeti's given names is ""Phil."" Sandman is one of the funniest characters in the film, despite being mute.There are also scary moments: The Boogieman sends nightmares into the world in an attempt to take away children's hope. He is visually striking: nearly monochromatic in an otherwise colorful world, and accompanied by swarms of black horses worthy of the Ringwraiths.*Spoiler Alert*There is hope: Children are able to defeat the Boogieman by facing and acknowledging frightening circumstances, and choosing not to be afraid of them. This is where the ""wishful thinking"" part of my title comes in. Bravery is a good virtue to commend to children, but some kids have been through traumatic circumstances in real life. They might not be able to just ""choose"" not to be afraid.*end of spoiler*Overall, Rise of the Guardians is a fun movie; it's worth your time, and will probably make your young kids laugh, shriek, and laugh again.

My one regret is not seeing it when it was in the cinema last year.  It's not at all what I expected.  It has action but no real violence.  It talks of the importance of childhood virtues such as wonder, hope, dreams, memories and fun.  And there seems to be a surprisingly spiritual overtone.  There is humor and ample creativity.  The film was beautifully made and Jack Frost is a sweet and endearing protagonist.  I think this is a highly under-rated movie that deserves more attention than it has received.  And if you like it the film is based on the childrens' book series The Guardians of Childhood.It's odd that here on Amazon the DVD is currently 10.99 yet to stream it is 13.99.  It's usually cheaper to stream a movie to a computer than it is to buy it on DVD.  This is the first time I have seen this with a movie listed here on Amazon.  So don't bother streaming it.

Also, my mind couldn't stop wondering about the accent of the characters. Especially Santa's accent.I don't know. I wasn't so exited with this movie. I suppose that's basically because I like other animation movies more. Most of Pixar for example, but also others, prior to Guardians, a few weeks ago we sawHotel Transylvania (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy). I liked Hotel Transylvania much more.The Guardians was just 'ok' for me. But I'd say enjoy the good parts, sit back, relax enjoy the good parts, especially the artwork and animation.Our 8 yol liked the characters, I think he liked Sandman the most.I think because Sandman seems the fun character between the guardians, while still being able to kick #ss!

It has plenty of heart and a few mildly funny moments and quite a few tear-jerking moments as well. (You probably want to bring a box of tissues with you to the theater, just in case.) This movie is quite a departure for DreamWorks Animation due to the fact that there are no pop-culture references or crass potty humor whatsoever. This is a truly wonderful timeless film that will be enjoyed for many generations. Hopefully DreamWorks will make a sequel and a T.V. series like they've done with some of thier other franchises because these characters deserve to have more stories told about them on screen!",5,A Classic Family-Friendly Film For All Ages!!!!

1485254,A1IYR4VU7ZCPQV,B005LAIIFS,"Ben-Oni ""Darkness""","[10, 44]","Saw this movie today because my family wanted to do something different for the holidays. I expected to hate it primarily because I was never raised to believe in any of the characters in it(That's not to say I wasn't familiar with the supposed lore behind at least four of them) and never could understand why parents would ever tell  their children about them but even things you consider stupid can be weaved into a beautifully depicted story. SPOILER ALERT! The main Character is  called Jack Frost, Originally he was a young man born in primitive (Not prehistoric) times who saved his sister from falling through thin ice at the cost of his own life.He is reincarnated  into Jack Frost  but loses his memories of his previous life. All he knows is his name which he claims to know because  the man in the moon told him so. He causes all sorts of mischeif around town with the powers of frost he weilds but can never be seen or felt by any of the children or adults. Later  he discovers that he cannot be seen by  the children because they don't believe in him.  Meanwhile  an ancient evil  reawakens  and begins his plot to eliminate his rivals  by causing children all over the world to cease believing in the easter bunny, Santa, the tooth fairy and the sandman as well as start believing in the boogeyman again. In light of this the man in the moon  elects a reluctant Jack Frost to be a guardian.Enough summary. Now for the reasons I gave this movie three stars amnd not five.Firstly, It blatantly contradicts itself over and over again. The gaurdians  and all other  fairytale helpers are specifically said to exist only as long as they're believed in but both jack and the boogeyman haven't been believed in for over 300 years so why didn't  cease to exist after all that time???. We see immediate  effects when just a few children stop believing in the Easter bunny and the tooth fairy but the boogeyman and Jack have existed pretty long without anyone's belief. I know that people are going to tell me that the belief rule only exists as long as you're a gaurdian but even when Jack was a guardian nobody believed in him until the movie was almost over.Secondly, the movie contradicts it's own supposed message if it even had one. If s something needs to be believed in to exist then it really doesn't exist at all aside from in the mind and yet Jack Frost  and the boogeyman really exist but they don't.  It makes no sense.Thirdly, I like the moon and stars and all but making the man in the moon a diety was a bit much for me. I didn't really care until Jack adresses the audience at the very end of the movie and says.  ""My name is Jack Frost. How do I know? because the moon told me so. So when the moon tells you something, listen.""Really?!!Fourth. The tooth fairys design. Ick. Looks like a cross between a hummingbird, a peacock and a beetle.  She's the tooth fairy for pete's sake. This isn't ex men or fern gully.Aside from that the story is entertaining, the graphics are beautiful and it's a great film.",3,Not too shabby.,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,3027,"['Saw', 'movie', 'today', 'family', 'wanted', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'holidays', 'expected', 'hate', 'primarily', 'was', 'never', 'raised', 'believe', 'characters', 'not', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'supposed', 'lore', 'behind', 'least', 'four', 'never', 'could', 'understand', 'why', 'parents', 'would', 'ever', 'tell', 'children', 'even', 'things', 'consider', 'stupid', 'can', 'be', 'weaved', 'beautifully', 'depicted', 'story', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'main', 'Character', 'called', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'Originally', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'born', 'primitive', 'Not', 'prehistoric', 'times', 'who', 'saved', 'sister', 'falling', 'thin', 'ice', 'cost', 'own', 'life.He', 'reincarnated', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'memories', 'previous', 'life', 'name', 'know', 'man', 'moon', 'told', 'so', 'sorts', 'mischeif', 'town', 'powers', 'frost', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'felt', 'children', 'adults', 'Later', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Meanwhile', 'ancient', 'evil', 'reawakens', 'plot', 'eliminate', 'rivals', 'causing', 'children', 'world', 'cease', 'believing', 'easter', 'bunny', 'Santa', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'sandman', 'as', 'well', 'start', 'believing', 'boogeyman', 'again', 'light', 'man', 'moon', 'reluctant', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'be', 'guardian.Enough', 'summary', 'Now', 'reasons', 'gave', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'not', 'five.Firstly', 'blatantly', 'over', 'again', 'gaurdians', 'other', 'fairytale', 'helpers', 'are', 'specifically', 'said', 'exist', 'only', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'believed', 'jack', 'boogeyman', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'believed', '300', 'years', 'so', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'cease', 'exist', 'time', 'see', 'immediate', 'effects', 'when', 'just', 'few', 'children', 'stop', 'believing', 'Easter', 'bunny', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'boogeyman', 'Jack', 'have', 'existed', 'pretty', 'long', 'anyone', 'belief', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'tell', 'belief', 'rule', 'only', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'gaurdian', 'even', 'when', 'Jack', 'was', 'guardian', 'nobody', 'believed', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'over.Secondly', 'movie', 'own', 'supposed', 'message', 'even', 'had', 'one', 's', 'something', 'needs', 'be', 'believed', 'exist', 'then', 'really', ""n't"", 'exist', 'aside', 'mind', 'yet', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'boogeyman', 'really', 'exist', 'do', ""n't"", 'sense.Thirdly', 'like', 'moon', 'stars', 'making', 'man', 'moon', 'diety', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Jack', 'audience', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'name', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'moon', 'told', 'so', 'So', 'when', 'moon', 'tells', 'something', 'listen.', 'Really', 'Fourth', 'tooth', 'fairys', 'design', 'Ick', 'cross', 'hummingbird', 'peacock', 'beetle', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'pete', 'sake', ""n't"", 'ex', 'men', 'fern', 'gully.Aside', 'story', 'entertaining', 'graphics', 'are', 'beautiful', 'great', 'film']",Rise of the Guardians: Easter Gift Set

It wasn't until I saw more of the clips that I changed my mind. While I love animated movies, it isn't every movie that I am willing to see. I was actually moved by this one especially the scenes where Sophie accidently invaded the Easter Warren when she finds one of North's snow globes, and where Jack managed to keep a young boy from losing his belief in the Easter Bunny or the other Guardians. What surprised me was that none of the characters were like the standard beings that we have ever seen in all of the Christmas movies and holiday specials. Santa AKA North, is Russian, and a powerhouse with twin swords and tattooed arms, and with an army of Yetis to do his toy making while the Elves performed the lesser tasks. The Easter Bunny throws boomerangs, egg bombs and is 6ft 1&#34; tall with aboriginal markings and an Australian accent. The Tooth Fairy and her entourage looked more like hummingbirds while the Sandman was a silent golden mute who &#34;speaks&#34; in symbols and signs but wields a pair of sand whips when he fights. This is more a story of Jack Frost finding himself while helping the other Guardians confront and defeat Pitch Black, a villain who intends on filling the entire world in darkness and fear by harnessing the dreams of children and turning them to nightmares. Pitch is indeed a menacing figure, one who tries to convince Jack to join him in his conquest, preying on his doubts and fears while Jack realizes that only by fulfilling his destiny as a Guardian can he find what he's really seeking within himself.

The art work and animation are superb and the story is very clever.  I loved How To Train Your Dragon as well and still do.  I don't understand why this movie did not do as well at the theaters.

1485288,A1OGORMOPYZ0PY,B005LAIIFS,"C. LeBlanc ""I love music!""","[1, 3]","Disney films for the last 10 years or so have just been awful.  Well, the animated ones anyway... and with only 3 exceptions that come to mind.  (Wall-e, Bolt, and Monsters,Inc.)  Thankfully, we have Dreamworks, who has not only picked up the slack; but has vastly surpassed them in both Quality and Entertainment for ALL Ages, and left Disney Animation coughing on their pixel-dust!  (no, not a type-o... Pixel Dust, haha)  (and did Disney even own Pixar when Monsters, Inc. came out???)The last 10 years for Dreamworks however, have been awesome, with only a couple ""misses"".  They've brought us Kung-Fu Panda (and a Super-Killer sequel)... How To Train Your Dragon... Monsters Vs Aliens... Megamind... Puss In Boots (loved it / didn't like the Shreks personally)... and many others... And now they've added this Disney-knock-out punch, Rise of The Guardians.Kind of makes you wonder what the Hell is wrong with Disney... And why they can't ever seem to get their act together, for more than 3-4 films, out of every 30 they release.  Aside from the ""classics"" (which I never really cared for all that much), their BEST films, ever, animation-wise, are unquestionably, The Little Mermaid (#1), The Lion King (#2), and Wall-e (#3)... Though obviously, many will disagree with the placement with 1 or all... But... Story, Originality, FUN (EVERY TIME), Engaging & Entertaining FOR ALL AGES... When looked at through that lens, I'm sure most will agree.  (Sorry; but Beauty & The Beast, is not top 10... way too many story/plot holes -- The ""age of the prince"" being the most glaring, with ""convenient (sloppy) writing"" throughout, and most of the songs are neither catchy, nor even good.  The Little Mermaid should've won the award(s), w/o a doubt, not B&TB...; but since TLM didn't; and the co-composer who did both, died (of aids), they gave him the posthumous-pity-award to make up for it, plain and simple.)Rise of The Guardians, is the kind of film, you'd expect (or at least, USE to expect) Disney to create... something that speaks to the child in all of us, yet is still greatly engaging & entertaining for all ages...-- These days, Disney can barely put a decent story together, let alone, create something with the above characteristics.  And while, many of the Dreamworks films (like Monsters vs Aliens, Megamind, H.T.T.Y.D., etc.) are certainly not going to be on anyone's ""top 10 list""... they still kick the butt of anything Disney has made in recent past, w/ the exception of Wall-e of course, as that is in my ""top 3"" obviously.Best of all, regarding this film... IT'S ORIGINAL.  They didn't take some ""classic fairy tale"" & put a weird twist on it, then take all the credit for the story (as was Disney's custom & how they built their 'empire').  Don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-Disney... Hell, I'm a member of their Reward Program; and LOVE more than a few of their movies; and have upgraded (most) to 3D!... But, that's not going to keep me from calling a spade a spade... And honestly, Disney has Sold Us Out For Far Too Long... whether that be through bad Managers, or complacent Animators... I'm pretty sick of it either way... So, THANK YOU, DREAMWORKS!!PS: I'm rather urked that they made Santa Claus RUSSIAN???  WTF!?-- Making the Easter Bunny, Australian, is one thing... Whatever... You want the ""cast"" to be ""International""... I get it... But when you think of Christmas, the LAST Country that comes to mind, is RUSSIA!! _ Plus, you'd have to completely discount the actual, GERMAN, beginnings/heritage of Santa Claus... (CLAUS, HELLO!!)... which would've lent itself to your ""International"" theme... and therefore makes NO sense, and no explanation is even attempted, as to why he's Russian, or why the Bunny is an Aussie.  (or why he has Russian-style tattoos all over his arms)--I don't know... that really, really bugged me... But, by the end of the film, I was so pleased with everything else, I figured 'why get hung up?'.  A lesser film, and that definitely would've been a coffin-nail (no-sale)... So, if you can get past that (and try not to think about it), you should enjoy this film, immensely... so, Enjoy!",5,Dreamworks...

It features Jack Frost, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, Santa, and the Sandman in stunning animation, along with the Bogeyman.  There is lots of comedy, lots of action, and some dark moments that may be disturbing for really small children.As the story begins, Jack Frost is born, rising out of a frozen pond and given his name by the Man in the Moon.  Jack discovers at least some of his powers, and his ability to have fun, but his real purpose only begins to become clear when he is summoned to the North Pole.  There, he will be invited to join his fellow childhood characters as a Guardian.  The ocasion is the return of the Bogeyman, a nasty character who wants to replace childhood dreams with nightmares.  The struggle of the Guardians with the Bogeyman is the core of the movie.  Jack will have to discover the secret of his own origins, just in time to save the day.""Rise of the Guardians"" has some name talent behind the excellent animation, and an imaginative storyline that audiences of all ages will enjoy.

1485344,A4796VPATRFR1,B005LAIIFS,Eoghann Irving,"[1, 2]","Rise of the Guardians is a movie based on the characters from William Joyce's Guardians of Childhood books. In fact the movie is set many years after the books and introduces a new guardian in Jack Frost, the other four (The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy, Sandman and Santa Claus each having been introduced in their own books).The movie is clearly intended for children and the guardians picked because they will be recognizable to that audience. The storyline is similarly straight forward too. The Bogeyman has a new plan that will have the worlds children stop believing in the guardians. And when that happens all that will be left is his nightmares.On top of that plot we have the layer of Jack Frost who has to learn who he really is and come into his own as a guardian. And again this is familiar territory, though reasonably well executed.Visually the movie is a treat. The character designs while not entirely faithful to the renditions in the books are clearly inspired by them. They are distinctive and full of character while being different from most other animation. The particle effects used for both Sandman, and Jack Frost are quite stunning too.Voicework is a mixed bag. None of it is terrible, but Alec Baldwin as Santa Claus stands out amongst the Guardians themselves and Jude law is pitch perfect as... well... Pitch (the bogeyman).That does leave the workmanlike script as the weakest element over all. It's not bad, but it lacks any particularly distinctive spark. From an adult perspective there are points that could really have benefited from more time. particularly the Guardians loss of powers which is very abrupt. But the running time is 97 minutes and you have to wonder if younger children would have the patience for much more than that.Set your expectations appropriate. This is fun and it doesn't require much in the way of concentration. It looks pretty and kids should enjoy it.

As children, it's not like the majority of us put Batman, Spider-Man and the Tooth Fairy in the same conversation - but, who needs Captain America and the rest of The Avengers when Jack Frost and The Sandman are watching over you?  As it turns out, novelist William Joyce believes folklore characters from our childhood would make for interesting superheroes.  His popular book series, The Guardians of Childhood, are the basis for the 2012 DreamWorks Animation film, Rise of the Guardians - which turn Santa, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and the Sandman, into heroes.  Not only does Santa and the rest of their characters bring children presents on the holidays, they are also collectively members of a super group that protects children (good or bad) - known as, ""The Guardians.""Adapted to screen by David Lindsay-Abaire (Robots) and directed by Peter Ramsey (Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space), Rise of the Guardians stars Jack Frost (Chris Pine), a super-powered young man (but at least 300 years old) with the ability to control the winter elements - including snow and ice.  Struggling to remember the person he was prior to becoming Jack Frost, he is reluctant to become a new member of ""The Guardians,"" a group that protects children.  The Guardians, led by Nicholas St. North, aka Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), are alerted that the Boogeyman (Jude Law) has returned to fill children with fear.  Along with Santa, the rest of the Guardians - E. Aster Bunnymund, aka the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) and the voiceless Sandman, aka Sandy - take on the task of convincing Jack Frost that he must become a member of The Guardians to help them stop the Boogeyman before he makes the world's children forget about all of them and force them to live in fear, forever.The Rise of the Guardians plot features the typical good vs. evil conundrum, with colorful characters and a slew of laugh-out-loud moments.  These characters stay true to their reputations and are wonderfully written and charming.  Alec Baldwin is the most notable in the voice acting department since he does such a stunning job of disguising his voice for the role of Santa Claus.  Hugh Jackman is clearly recognizable (and the rabbit/kangaroo references are quite funny), as is Jude Law in his role as the villain, the Boogyman - a dark and dastardly `avatar' look-a-like.  The third tier supporting characters are quiet, yet effective - which include a large group of tooth fairies, elves, walking eggs, and wookie-looking creatures.  As it turns out, the elves are relatively useless in Santa's workshop, with the majority of the work being done by these Chewbacca-like wookies (that also speak in a similar manner as a wookie).In principle, this film feels like the animated holiday version of Marvel's The Avengers.  Santa is the leader, and it takes a major super villain to bring the entire team together in order to fight for the same cause:  protecting the world's children.  Aside from the plot, this film is simply one more film, like Toy Story or any other children's film that centers around one specific character, where the main character is inevitably surrounded by a wide-range of supporting characters with very different personalities.  However, in the case of The Guardians, you really couldn't find a group of characters with less in common (different jobs) and more in common (children) all at the same time - which is the dynamic that makes the premise of this film such a unique idea.It's difficult to find any outstanding issues with Rise of the Guardians and overall, it's a very well-rounded film.  Not only does this film feature a majority of the beloved holiday characters - it's a film that everyone can easily enjoy.  The film makes for a comforting trip down memory lane - a trip that the whole family should sit down and enjoy together.  There's a bit of humor, a handful of action scenes, and some of the most recognizable names in Hollywood doing the voice work - all collectively creating a memorable movie experience.Overall Film Grade:  BFNDNreview.com",4,'The Guardians' a pure animated delight,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,4195,"['when', 'are', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'superheroes', 'children', 'not', 'majority', 'put', 'Batman', 'Spider-Man', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'same', 'conversation', 'who', 'Captain', 'America', 'rest', 'Avengers', 'when', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'Sandman', 'are', 'watching', 'out', 'novelist', 'William', 'Joyce', 'folklore', 'characters', 'childhood', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'superheroes', 'popular', 'book', 'series', 'Guardians', 'Childhood', 'are', 'basis', '2012', 'DreamWorks', 'Animation', 'film', 'Rise', 'Guardians', 'turn', 'Santa', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'Sandman', 'heroes', 'Not', 'only', 'Santa', 'rest', 'characters', 'bring', 'children', 'presents', 'holidays', 'are', 'also', 'collectively', 'members', 'super', 'group', 'children', 'good', 'bad', 'known', 'Guardians', 'Adapted', 'screen', 'David', 'Lindsay-Abaire', 'Robots', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Ramsey', 'Monsters', 'vs.', 'Aliens', 'Mutant', 'Pumpkins', 'Outer', 'Space', 'Rise', 'Guardians', 'stars', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'super-powered', 'young', 'man', 'least', '300', 'years', 'old', 'ability', 'control', 'winter', 'elements', 'including', 'snow', 'ice', 'Struggling', 'remember', 'person', 'was', 'prior', 'becoming', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'reluctant', 'become', 'new', 'member', 'Guardians', 'group', 'children', 'Guardians', 'led', 'Nicholas', 'St.', 'North', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'are', 'alerted', 'Boogeyman', 'Jude', 'Law', 'returned', 'fill', 'children', 'fear', 'Santa', 'rest', 'Guardians', 'E.', 'Aster', 'Bunnymund', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'voiceless', 'Sandman', 'Sandy', 'take', 'task', 'convincing', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'must', 'become', 'member', 'Guardians', 'help', 'stop', 'Boogeyman', 'world', 'children', 'forget', 'force', 'live', 'fear', 'forever.The', 'Rise', 'Guardians', 'plot', 'typical', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'conundrum', 'colorful', 'characters', 'slew', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'characters', 'stay', 'true', 'reputations', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'charming', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'most', 'notable', 'voice', 'acting', 'department', 'stunning', 'job', 'disguising', 'voice', 'role', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'clearly', 'recognizable', 'rabbit/kangaroo', 'references', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'Jude', 'Law', 'role', 'villain', 'Boogyman', 'dark', 'dastardly', 'avatar', 'look-a-like', 'third', 'tier', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'quiet', 'yet', 'effective', 'include', 'large', 'group', 'tooth', 'fairies', 'elves', 'walking', 'eggs', 'wookie-looking', 'creatures', 'out', 'elves', 'are', 'relatively', 'useless', 'Santa', 'workshop', 'majority', 'work', 'being', 'done', 'Chewbacca-like', 'wookies', 'also', 'speak', 'similar', 'manner', 'wookie', '.In', 'principle', 'film', 'feels', 'animated', 'holiday', 'version', 'Marvel', 'Avengers', 'Santa', 'leader', 'major', 'super', 'villain', 'bring', 'entire', 'team', 'together', 'order', 'fight', 'same', 'cause', 'protecting', 'world', 'children', 'Aside', 'plot', 'film', 'simply', 'one', 'more', 'film', 'Toy', 'Story', 'other', 'children', 'film', 'centers', 'one', 'specific', 'character', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'inevitably', 'surrounded', 'wide-range', 'supporting', 'characters', 'very', 'different', 'personalities', 'However', 'case', 'Guardians', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'group', 'characters', 'less', 'common', 'different', 'jobs', 'more', 'common', 'children', 'same', 'time', 'dynamic', 'premise', 'film', 'unique', 'idea.It', 'difficult', 'find', 'outstanding', 'issues', 'Rise', 'Guardians', 'overall', 'very', 'well-rounded', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'feature', 'majority', 'beloved', 'holiday', 'characters', 'film', 'everyone', 'can', 'easily', 'enjoy', 'film', 'comforting', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'trip', 'whole', 'family', 'should', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'together', 'bit', 'humor', 'handful', 'action', 'scenes', 'most', 'recognizable', 'names', 'Hollywood', 'doing', 'voice', 'work', 'collectively', 'creating', 'memorable', 'movie', 'experience.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'BFNDNreview.com']",Rise of the Guardians: Easter Gift Set

1485354,AG8K92N37MT27,B005LAIIFS,Garnet,"[0, 0]","I am pretty picky about animated movies that I buy and keep and watch again and again.  This one was worth watching once, but is not one that I aim to keep.  It had some funny and cute moments and the animation was good, though not as good as in Brave or the Toy Story series, but overall it just wasn't as appealing.  It was good, but not great.The Guardians are a collection of familiar figures who are chosen to protect children's beliefs.  They are born of the belief of children and are maintained by that belief.  They include Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman, and the Tooth Fairy.  But when trouble stirs, another Guardian is called to join their team, Jack Frost...in whom there isn't enough belief to make him visible to kids.  He is kind of footloose, fancy-free, and wild and refuses to join their team, but gets dragged in anyway.  They face another figure that is familiar to kids--the Boogie Man, who plans to turn all children's beliefs into fear and nightmares and so take over the world.Pluses in the movie include Santa Claus's Russian-style accent, his assortment of goofy bell-like elves, and his army of Yeti.  Also, having the Easter Bunny with an Australian accent and being so far from fluffy as you could get was another high point.  We get to visit not just Santa's shop at the North Pole, but the Easter Bunny's headquarters where all those pretty painted eggs come from.  There were genuinely funny moments in this movie, and the message was a positive one in the end, but I doubt this movie will ever become an animated classic.  It just didn't have enough adult appeal, such as you find in animated movies like Toy Story and The Incredibles.Not so much for the very youngest kids due to some scary moments, but slightly older ones will probably enjoy it.",3,Worth Watching Once,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,1794,"['am', 'pretty', 'picky', 'animated', 'movies', 'buy', 'keep', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'one', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'not', 'one', 'aim', 'keep', 'had', 'funny', 'cute', 'moments', 'animation', 'was', 'good', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Brave', 'Toy', 'Story', 'series', 'overall', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'appealing', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great.The', 'Guardians', 'are', 'collection', 'familiar', 'figures', 'who', 'are', 'chosen', 'protect', 'children', 'beliefs', 'are', 'born', 'belief', 'children', 'are', 'maintained', 'belief', 'include', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'Sandman', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'when', 'trouble', 'stirs', 'Guardian', 'called', 'join', 'team', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'whom', ""n't"", 'enough', 'belief', 'make', 'visible', 'kids', 'kind', 'footloose', 'fancy-free', 'wild', 'join', 'team', 'dragged', 'anyway', 'face', 'figure', 'familiar', 'kids', 'Boogie', 'Man', 'who', 'turn', 'children', 'beliefs', 'fear', 'nightmares', 'so', 'take', 'over', 'world.Pluses', 'movie', 'include', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Russian-style', 'accent', 'assortment', 'goofy', 'bell-like', 'elves', 'army', 'Yeti', 'Also', 'having', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'Australian', 'accent', 'being', 'so', 'far', 'fluffy', 'could', 'get', 'was', 'high', 'point', 'get', 'visit', 'not', 'just', 'Santa', 'shop', 'North', 'Pole', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'headquarters', 'where', 'pretty', 'painted', 'eggs', 'come', 'were', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie', 'message', 'was', 'positive', 'one', 'end', 'doubt', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'become', 'animated', 'classic', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'adult', 'appeal', 'such', 'find', 'animated', 'movies', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Incredibles.Not', 'so', 'much', 'very', 'youngest', 'kids', 'due', 'scary', 'moments', 'slightly', 'older', 'ones', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy']",Rise of the Guardians: Easter Gift Set

I was very pleasantly surprised how outstanding this film is.It is among the most spectacular computer generated animations ever created...every time the multi-colored tooth fairy shows up on the screen (or her baby fairies) I smiled.  And that is the point of this movie..it makes you smile. ""Wings up, Ladies!"" (Yes, this is one of those movies that the BIG SCREEN and HIGH DEFINITION enhance enjoyment).  I believe that the astonishing look of the film has something to do with Guillermo del Toro, executive producer - because he is the man responsible for ""Pan's Labyrinth"", the film that changed the rules on Computer Animation in movies and made an indelible impression on world wide audiences.A perfect movie for children - with no annoying bathroom humor - a (religious?) battle between good and evil that is not too dark. No one gets killed or wounded because the matter in controversy is the quality of dreams.  My favorite character is Santa Claus - with gang tattoos of ""naughty"" on one arm and ""nice"" on the other. Instead of the usual stereotype, he turns out to be Russian or Ukrainian.  We know this from his accent and expressions (When upset, he will say something like ""Shostakovich""). And...part of the fun is that Santa uses Abominable Snowmen to make the toys rather than the elves who don't do much work at all. The purpose of the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and Santa Claus is to bring hope, cheer, and wonder to children.  Enter  - - - Jack Frost --- who has not taken sides yet. Like so many of us, he is seeking the answer to why he is here on earth... his spiritual journey is the core of the film and his quest will determine the childrens' fate.The characters are adorable, perhaps even the villain (The Bogeyman) was once himself.  The reason he has decided to change happy dreams to frightening ones derives from his loneliness.  He believes dark dreams is a way to achieve recognition....alas, an unhappy characteristic that is a dangerous one in our times.  Our heroes, or shall I say superheroes, won't allow that since their mission as GUARDIANS is to protect the children always.Hey, let's get a real family movie for the kids..not ""Bad Santa.""

The answer is something close to ""The Avengers, but with Holiday figures"" and is just as entertaining, leading to one of the year's most surprisingly good films.In a world where the world's most famous holiday figures work to protect children and keep them happy, a great threat has emerged...a mysterious figure known as Shade, who seeks to destroy the guardians and the children they protect.  The guardians' only hope is to enlist mythical figure Jack Frost...but even together, can they turn the tide against a world that may no longer believe in them?Despite the marketing campaign that portrays Guardians as a typical, sugar-coated cartoon for the kiddies (and in some ways it is, with lots of jokes, bright colors, and a message about the magic of believing), what's most surprising is the adult themes hidden within the rather-simple story, revolving around an exploration of faith and belief in things you can't see.  The main character, Jack Frost, is the perfect anti-hero: he may be mischievous and fun-loving, but beneath it all is a confused individual who spends most of the film begging an unseen deity for answers: Why am I here?  What's my purpose?  Why did you create me?  His search for answers provides Guardians with a powerful emotional core, one that anyone who has struggled with faith can perfectly relate to.While the story is simple, and at times isn't exactly clear on the rules of it's universe (such as what happens to individuals when nobody believes in them) kids will no doubt be excited by all the action and jokes on screen, and adults will find a lot to keep their interest with the grown-up tones, making Guardians one of the biggest surprises of 2012.  Don't let the kiddy look fool you: this is a film with charm, and some genuinely heart-warming moments that stand equal with Pixar at their best.",4,Do You Believe?,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2003,"['What', 'Santa', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Sandman', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'teamed', 'up', 'defeat', 'evil', 'force', 'corrupt', 'children', 'world', 'answer', 'something', 'close', 'Avengers', 'Holiday', 'figures', 'just', 'entertaining', 'leading', 'one', 'year', 'most', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'films.In', 'world', 'where', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'holiday', 'figures', 'work', 'protect', 'children', 'keep', 'happy', 'great', 'threat', 'emerged', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'known', 'Shade', 'who', 'destroy', 'guardians', 'children', 'protect', 'guardians', 'only', 'hope', 'enlist', 'mythical', 'figure', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'even', 'together', 'can', 'turn', 'tide', 'world', 'may', 'no', 'longer', 'believe', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'Guardians', 'typical', 'sugar-coated', 'cartoon', 'kiddies', 'ways', 'lots', 'jokes', 'bright', 'colors', 'message', 'magic', 'believing', 'what', 'most', 'surprising', 'adult', 'themes', 'hidden', 'rather-simple', 'story', 'revolving', 'exploration', 'faith', 'belief', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'main', 'character', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'perfect', 'anti-hero', 'may', 'be', 'mischievous', 'fun-loving', 'confused', 'individual', 'who', 'most', 'film', 'begging', 'unseen', 'deity', 'answers', 'Why', 'am', 'here', 'What', 'purpose', 'Why', 'did', 'create', 'search', 'answers', 'Guardians', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'core', 'one', 'anyone', 'who', 'struggled', 'faith', 'can', 'perfectly', 'relate', 'story', 'simple', 'times', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'clear', 'rules', 'universe', 'such', 'what', 'individuals', 'when', 'nobody', 'kids', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'excited', 'action', 'jokes', 'screen', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'keep', 'interest', 'grown-up', 'tones', 'making', 'Guardians', 'one', 'biggest', 'surprises', '2012', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'kiddy', 'look', 'fool', 'film', 'charm', 'genuinely', 'heart-warming', 'moments', 'stand', 'equal', 'Pixar', 'best']",Rise of the Guardians: Easter Gift Set

I took  advantage of his natural fears  to reinforce one of the focal points of this movie which is that  we will  always feel fear and that's a normal and healthy feeling but we have to overcome those fears because they make the situations and the things or people that oppose us stronger and bigger while taking our confidence away.That's in my opinion the value of this movie aside of the entertainment factor that in the end is what take you to the movies.It is a good movie with beautiful and well directed animation and a surprisingly good script and of course a happy ending.",5,Great movie for the kiddos,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,1664,"['movie', 'have', 'ingredients', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'depicted', 'regular', 'kids', 'heroes', 'new', 'have', 'say', 'very', 'different', 'light', 'Santa', 'Easter', 'bunny', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'sandman', 'etc.for', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'simple', 'kids', 'movie', 'concept', 'believing', 'find', '34', 'center', '34', 'what', 'who', 'are', '34', 'joy', '34', '34', 'hope', '34', '34', 'courage', '34', 'new', 'guardian', 'needs', 'find', 'out', 'becoming', '34', 'Guardian', '34', 'Disney', 'type', 'movies', 'always', 'have', 'be', 'villain', 'case', 'Boogie', 'man', 'played', 'humble', 'opinion', 'masterfully', 'Jude', 'Law', 'also', 'concept', 'team', 'work', '34', 'be', 'part', 'team', '34', 'not', 'only', 'individual', 'times', 'egotistical', 'feats', 'something', 'vogue', 'nowadays', 'guardians', 'are', 'team', 'Boogie', 'man', 'alone', 'so', 'who', 'do', 'think', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'losing', 'son', 'opinion', 'very', 'good', 'critic', 'children', 'movies', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'lot', 'even', 'got', 'little', 'bit', 'frighten', 'Boogie', 'man', 'took', 'advantage', 'natural', 'fears', 'reinforce', 'one', 'focal', 'points', 'movie', 'will', 'always', 'feel', 'fear', 'normal', 'healthy', 'feeling', 'have', 'overcome', 'fears', 'make', 'situations', 'things', 'people', 'oppose', 'stronger', 'bigger', 'taking', 'confidence', 'opinion', 'value', 'movie', 'aside', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'end', 'what', 'take', 'movies.It', 'good', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'well', 'directed', 'animation', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'script', 'course', 'happy', 'ending']",Rise of the Guardians: Easter Gift Set

Santa has tattoos and a thick Russian accent, the Easter Bunny is Australian and not particularly cute, and the Tooth Fairy looks like a hummingbird rather than a typical fairy.  I'll admit, when I first saw the advertisements and the trailer for it, I instantly dismissed this as a box office bomb working too hard to target a family audience.  Oh, how I was mistaken.This film is amusing, touching, has a message as well as characters you can relate to.  The film follows Jack as he struggles to find his ""center"" or purpose.  People hear his name from time to time, but nobody really knows who he is nor are they able to see him as they can Santa, ect.  With the help of his other guardian friends he is able to remember his past life and discover why the man on the moon created him.There what I would describe as ""dark"" scenes that might frighten younger or more sensitive viewers.

1485426,AWAXS66YMHMNW,B005LAIIFS,"J. Thomason ""Movie Family""","[2, 2]","Hey, we originally reviewed this movie back in April before we started Bowling for Movies!  This is the new and improved review:Rise of the Guardians Bowling for Movies Score: 231.188 of 300What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]Rise of the Guardians - we own the Three-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy + UltraVioletMovie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):Nimble-footed trickster Jack Frost is called upon to rise to occasion and join the ranks of the Guardians (including Santa, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman) when Boogeyman threatens to destroy childhood by changing dreams into nightmares.  Will this diabolical plot be upset by the Guardians... will Jack grow up and take his place among them... or will Boogeyman snuff out childhood dreams and belief??In a day and age filled to the brim with spectacular computer animation, witty dialog, spin on classic characters, and feel good endings - how can a children's film stand out from the crowd?  The answer - you don't.  Why mess with a formula that's working?  This movie certainly didn't break any new ground in those departments.  (Whoa, movie dude - what gives???  You gave this movie a pretty high score to start out like this - where is the love???)  If you're Big Hollywood, here is what you do - if you're not going to INNOVATE, you IMITATE.  And this movie did just that.  Reluctant hero, called upon to save the day; gives up on the task and himself; only to come back triumphant in the end and finding his true place in the world... is it Shrek or Jack Frost - same story, different location - insert holiday theme :]  (hey, Shrek saved storybook critters, Jack saved Holiday belief!!  That's different!!)  Is it?  I know I didn't see this exact same thing in Polar Express or The Santa Clause 3 - The Escape Clause; oh wait - I did.That said, I did in fact give it a significant score, well above 200 and in bowling terms, that's a great game.  It was well written, I enjoyed the spin on Santa (or North as he is known), I more than enjoyed the cinematic majesty laid out in rich, un-ghosted 3D.  What this movie lacked in originality it made up for in bringing vivid animation to the big screen.  The story is been-there-done-that but solid, beautifully told, and brings you quickly from the mundane world we live in, into a world were Santa has tattoos (and you don't mind) and the Sandman doesn't say much (out loud) but WOWs with his presence.  The crime of copy-cat-idous is nothing new, especially in this genre - a more imaginative and original story might have seen this movie ""bowl"" a perfect game because it had everything else in place to do just that.  How the technical end of this flick didn't garner at least a nod from the academy is simply beyond me.What I loved:-  Spectacularly animated - wonderfully rich world in vibrant color palette and jaw dropping 3D-  Standard issue story, sure, but told with heart-  I personally appreciated a much more naturalistic view of not only the holidays but the Guardians; what a great break from the battle between religious and commercial interests, at the end of the day these traditions started in veneration of nature (despite where people try to take them, regardless of what they are peddling)What I did NOT like:-  The story itself is a little tired but hey, new audience wouldn't really know that and let's face it - most of America is asleep on their feet and haven't even figured out Star Wars is really just Lord of The Rings (in sppppaaaaacccceee)Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews. Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.",4,Rise of the Guardians Bowling for Movies...,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,4700,"['Hey', 'originally',

After seeing Dreamworks progress from pop-culture-laden parody flicks (such as the ""Shrek"" films, ""Shark Tale,"" and ""Bee Movie"") to well-done story-and-character driven films that could hold their own against Pixar's empire (""How To Train Your Dragon,"" ""Kung Fu Panda,"" and ""Megamind""), this somehow seemed a step backward.  Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy?  Somehow that failed to appeal to me.On a recommendation from a friend, however, I brought the movie home from our library.  And our entire family was blown away.  This wasn't a fluffy kid's flick -- it was an epic fantasy with a boldly realized world and characters.Based on William Joyce's ""Guardians of Childhood"" books, the world of this film is watched over by the Guardians -- immortal beings who protect and watch over the children of the world, fueled by their belief and in turn preserving the hope, wonder, dreams, and memories of childhood.  Said Guardians -- Nicholas St. North (Santa Claus), Bunnymund (the Easter Bunny), the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman -- are less than thrilled when their governing entity, the Man in the Moon, appoints a fifth Guardian... Jack Frost, a young trickster with no memory and no desire to be roped into a new responsibility.  But when a sinister threat rises to spread fear and darkness over the world -- Pitch Black, the Boogeyman -- it just may fall on the newest Guardian to stop him, help his new friends, and quite possibly save the world.This film is one of the most visually impressive Dreamworks films yet.  The worlds of the various Guardians are imaginative and lushly depicted, with vibrant colors and memorable, dreamlike visuals.  And the characters themselves have been re-imagined quite well -- instead of fitting to the commercialized looks most people know, they've been modeled to fit right into this new fantasy world.  North is more reminiscent of an Old World Father Christmas, the Tooth Fairy wears an elaborate hummingbird-like ensemble, and Bunnymund looks more like a creature out of ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" than a fluffy pastel-colored bunny, which is a good thing.The re-imagining of the characters isn't just in their physical appearances -- they're each given their own unique personality, and they play well off of each other.  Jack, while mischievous and  frequently at odds with the others, is unexpectedly vulnerable at times, and is quite protective of those more helpless than he is.  North is an enthusiastic warrior, still jolly but also quite willing to deliver a smackdown when needed.  The Tooth Fairy is quite eccentric but well-meaning, and has an almost maternal attitude toward her comrades and charges.  The Sandman, mute but friendly, mostly plays straight man to the others, while Bunnymund is a gruff snarker with a well-guarded softer side.  (On a side note, Bunny is voiced by Hugh Jackman, officially making him the most awesome incarnation of the Easter Bunny EVER.)  Only Pitch is somewhat one-dimensional, though he's an effectively creepy villain and it's quite obvious that Jude Law thoroughly enjoyed voicing him.Above all, though, I loved the concept of this movie -- that these familiar childhood icons not only make children happy, but protect them from the malevolent forces of the world.  It takes these icons and makes them into something epic, re-weaving the folklore into something worthy of mythology.  It may not do this perfectly, but it does it admirably and imaginatively, and I for one appreciate seeing a new side to some of the most beloved childhood figures in the world.In short, this is what a Rankin-Bass holiday special would look like if directed by Joss Whedon and Hayao Miyazaki.  It's epic and badass, but still retains a sense of wonder and fun, and sets it in a uniquely beautiful, imaginatively designed world.  Probably a little too scary for young children (Pitch can be quite terrifying to the little ones -- I'd say age 7 and up), but even adults will find something to love and admire in this film.",5,Unique and imaginative look at beloved childhood icons,1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,4089,"['When', 'family', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'were', 'little', 'skeptical', 'seeing', 'Dreamworks', 'progress', 'pop-culture-laden', 'parody', 'flicks', 'such', 'Shrek', 'films', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'well-done', 'story-and-character', 'driven', 'films', 'could', 'hold', 'own', 'Pixar', 'empire', 'How', 'Train', 'Your', 'Dragon', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'Megamind', 'somehow', 'seemed', 'step', 'backward', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Somehow', 'failed', 'appeal', 'me.On', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'however', 'brought', 'movie', 'home', 'library', 'entire', 'family', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'was', ""n't"", 'fluffy', 'kid', 'flick', 'was', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'boldly', 'realized', 'world', 'characters.Based', 'William', 'Joyce', 'Guardians', 'Childhood', 'books', 'world', 'film', 'watched', 'Guardians', 'immortal', 'beings', 'who', 'protect', 'watch', 'children', 'world', 'fueled', 'belief', 'turn', 'preserving', 'hope', 'wonder', 'dreams', 'memories', 'childhood', 'Said', 'Guardians', 'Nicholas', 'St.', 'North', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Bunnymund', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Sandman', 'are', 'less', 'thrilled', 'when', 'governing', 'entity', 'Man', 'Moon', 'fifth', 'Guardian', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'young', 'trickster', 'memory', 'desire', 'be', 'roped', 'new', 'responsibility', 'when', 'sinister', 'threat', 'spread', 'fear', 'darkness', 'world', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Boogeyman', 'just', 'may', 'fall', 'newest', 'Guardian', 'stop', 'help', 'new', 'friends', 'quite', 'possibly', 'save', 'world.This', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'impressive', 'Dreamworks', 'films', 'yet', 'worlds', 'various', 'Guardians', 'are', 'imaginative', 'lushly', 'depicted', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'memorable', 'dreamlike', 'visuals', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 're-imagined', 'quite', 'well', 'instead', 'fitting', 'commercialized', 'most', 'people', 'know', ""'ve"", 'been', 'modeled', 'fit', 'right', 'new', 'fantasy', 'world', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'Old', 'World', 'Father', 'Christmas', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'elaborate', 'hummingbird-like', 'ensemble', 'Bunnymund', 'more', 'creature', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'fluffy', 'pastel-colored', 'bunny', 'good', 'thing.The', 're-imagining', 'characters', ""n't"", 'just', 'physical', 'appearances', ""'re"", 'given', 'own', 'unique', 'personality', 'play', 'well', 'other', 'Jack', 'mischievous', 'frequently', 'odds', 'others', 'unexpectedly', 'vulnerable', 'times', 'quite', 'protective', 'more', 'helpless', 'North', 'enthusiastic', 'warrior', 'still', 'jolly', 'also', 'quite', 'willing', 'deliver', 'smackdown', 'when', 'needed', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'quite', 'eccentric', 'well-meaning', 'almost', 'maternal', 'attitude', 'comrades', 'charges', 'Sandman', 'mute', 'friendly', 'mostly', 'straight', 'man', 'others', 'Bunnymund', 'gruff', 'snarker', 'well-guarded', 'softer', 'side', 'side', 'note', 'Bunny', 'voiced', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'officially', 'making', 'most', 'awesome', 'incarnation', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'EVER', 'Only', 'Pitch', 'somewhat', 'one-dimensional', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'villain', 'quite', 'obvious', 'Jude', 'Law', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'voicing', 'him.Above', 'loved', 'concept', 'movie', 'familiar', 'childhood', 'icons', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'children', 'happy', 'protect', 'malevolent', 'forces', 'world', 'icons', 'something', 'epic', 're-weaving', 'folklore', 'something', 'worthy', 'mythology', 'may', 'not', 'do', 'perfectly', 'admirably', 'imaginatively', 'one', 'appreciate', 'seeing', 'new', 'side', 'most', 'beloved', 'childhood', 'figures', 'world.In', 'short', 'what', 'Rankin-Bass', 'holiday', 'special', 'would', 'look', 'directed', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'epic', 'badass', 'still', 'sense', 'wonder', 'fun', 'uniquely', 'beautiful', 'imaginatively', 'designed', 'world', 'Probably', 'little', 'too', 'scary', 'young', 'children', 'Pitch', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'terrifying', 'little', 'ones', ""'d"", 'say', 'age', '7', 'up', 'even', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'love', 'admire', 'film']",Rise of the Guardians: Easter Gift Set

1485472,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B005LAIIFS,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[6, 10]","It seems Holiday films can be seen almost anywhere, but few are as fun and heartfelt as Dreamworks, 'Rise Of The Guardians'. I was attending a Dreamwork's screening and it was director Peter Ramsey (Monster Vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space) who took the book by William Joyce and the wonderful screenplay by David Lindsay-Abaire (Oz The Great and Powerful, Robots) and made a really passionate film about the various Holiday Icons and their familiarity with each other and why they are all forced to save the children of the world in one night or two.Leading the cast, and explaining his backstory, is the voice of Chris Pine (Star Trek 2009, Unstoppable) playing the always present but never noticed Jack Frost. The story begins and ends with him learning about who he really is, what he is capable of and what lies in the center of his being that literally saves all the children of the world.  Jack has a very real emotional arch that I think kids are really going to sympathize with and understand why the Man In the Moon chose him as the next Guardian. (Of the children of the world.)Producer Christina Steinberg (Bee Movie, National Treasure) says, ""Working with the cast was amazing. The time and creativity they put into their characters brought them colorfully to life. Really better than what we expected. These actors transformed themselves into these characters.""Alec Baldwin (30 Rock, Rock of Ages) is the voice of North (otherwise known as S. Claus) who has the task of convincing not only Jack of his purpose in life and meaning for becoming a Guardian for the children of the world, but he has to convince his fellow teammates that Jack is worthy of the Man In The Moon's choice - to be another Guardian.Ilsa Fisher (Wedding Crashers, Rango) is the voice of Tooth (or the Tooth Fairy) who really needs help from all her fellow Guardians and especially Jack who sees the real meaning of each tooth that the Tooth Fairy takes. She is so warm and friendly and there is an effervescent charm in her and her little fairies that help her.Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Le Miserables) plays Bunny (or also known as the East Bunny) who has an accent, an attitude and a real issue with Jack joining their exclusive group. However, by the end of the film - Jack and Bunny end up being truly the very best at what they do.Now add the element of the bad guy, Pitch Black, voiced sinisterly by Jude Law (Sherlock Holms, I.E.) and you have one of the scariest and meanest villains in the realm of animation films. He's mean and hurtful and he and Jack have an amazing showdown at the end that will warm your heart. There is even the character of The Sandman that has no dialogue but speaks through pictures made by piles of sand and he is hysterically funny doing it.Executive Producer and creative consultant Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labrynth, Hellboy) says, ""I loved what the story was developing into. It was really alive and filled with great visuals. The details from the cast and their passion were amazing to watch. I think kids of all ages will love this film!""`Rise of the Guardians' is a real adventurous film with color, style and the most amazing animation which works well both in 2D and even better in 3D. Most importantly it has an excellent story with a real heart at its center and it will make you feel good after seeing it.

As it happened, not only did we watch the entire film, but so did half of my family!  We were all starstruck by this amazing movie!The Rise of the Guardians is definitely the most advanced and beautifully animated film I have ever seen.  The level of detail and artistic vision in each scene was absolutely incredible, more so when I know just how much painstaking effort goes into making animated films.  Besides the design, the screenwriting was excellent, which says a lot in an age where most animated films are written for young children, and so seem very immature-borderline-idiotic.  But even adults could be entertained by the banter and the dramatic flair in RotG.  Also, the storytelling was flawless--the plot was tidy, the characters smart and winsome, the settings interesting and visionary--the story pacing never lagged and the action flowed smoothly.  Lastly, the voice talent was especially great.  The actors really sold the characters; Chris Pine was brilliant as Jack--he brought so much energy and emotion, and his narration was beautiful.For me, the bright moments were seeing where each character lived and how they traveled (like Santa in the North Pole--love his sleigh!) and watching the comic elves.  Perhaps the first thing to make me laugh was Sandman--to get much-deserved attention--picking up a tiny elf and shaking him to make his hat's little bell ring!  And definitely the best humorous comeback belongs to the Easter Bunny, as the heroes race through the ice tunnels on Santa's sleigh...Santa (enjoying himself): I hope you like the loop-the-loops!Bunny (with a death-grip on his seat): *gulp* Hope you like carrots!If you have any appreciation for fun animated films, please give this one screen time at your house.

1485496,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B005LAIIFS,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[98, 122]","Ever since ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" comic (not the movie), I've been intrigued by the basic premise: legendary characters from other genres are given the superhero treatment and then brought together under unlikely circumstances to face a global threat.  This structure is the standard plot of just about every Avengers and Justice League comic, but only recently -- perhaps a sign of the times -- has cobbling together a diverse cast of characters become movie entertainment.""Rise of the Guardians"" continues the trend by turning the dial on iconic characters like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman up to 11. Each of these characters gives a gift to children, which in turn causes the children to believe in them and bestows a form of immortality. It's an oddly parasitic relationship that was prominent in Wizard of the Coast's ""The Primal Order"" supplement, in which deities need worshippers to gain power. Our heroes may not be all that powerful, but they are certainly popular.  At least some of them are.One of the questions weighing on my mind in bringing my five-year-old to this film was how ""Rise"" would deal with Santa Claus. It's one thing to question the existence of the Tooth Fairy (I never liked her anyway), the Easter Bunny (does anyone believe he exists?), and the Sandman (pretty sure NOBODY believes he exists)...but Santa Claus?  That's some tricky turf right there.Parents needn't worry.  Santa is a jovial, dual saber-wielding slavic warrior full of wisdom, jolly humor, and generosity.  As voiced by Alec Baldwin, this is a Santa I can get on board with!The Sandman doesn't speak, but he pantomimes through thought-forms that lend themselves well to 3-D viewing.The Easter Bunny is voiced by Hugh Jackman, which seems oddly natural.  He's a combative, boomerang-wielding humanoid rabbit that can throw egg-smoke bombs like a ninja.  He's also pretty adorable.Isla Fisher (yes, the nymphomaniac from ""Wedding Crashers"") plays the Tooth Fairy as a neurotic workaholic who has been ""out of the field"" for so long that she no longer knows how to relate to kids. She also moons over Jack Frost (Chris Pine, AKA Captain Kirk).Frost is the teenager of the bunch, frustrated by his lack of fame which makes him literally invisible to children.  Frost is on a personal journey to discover how he became who he is and in doing so, accepting his role as a new Guardian of children.And that's what ""Guardians"" is secretly all about: aging gracefully into parenthood.  The older adults (the existing Guardians) worry about being forgotten, uninvolved in their children's lives.  Pitch the Boogeyman (voiced by an unctuous Jude Law) craves attention so much that he would be happy to just be feared because it means he will be remembered.  And Frost has to deal with his own childhood before he can become a parent.There are some amazing set pieces, plenty of clever quips, and enough magical battles to keep the movie clicking along.  But Frost is something of a bland catch-all for every rebellious ""cool kid"" in the history of movies (he wears a hoodie, he MUST be cool!) and his big revelation about his past isn't much of a revelation at all. ""Rise of the Guardians"" is clearly just getting beginning to launch a franchise, and this is a good start. But I'll take a movie about just good ole sword-swinging Claus any day.",4,Superheroes for the Holidays,1353456000,"11 21, 2012",2012,3382,"['Ever', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'comic', 'not', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'intrigued', 'basic', 'premise', 'legendary', 'characters', 'other', 'genres', 'are', 'given', 'superhero', 'treatment', 'then', 'brought', 'together', 'unlikely', 'circumstances', 'face', 'global', 'threat', 'structure', 'standard', 'plot', 'just', 'Avengers', 'Justice', 'League', 'comic', 'only', 'recently', 'perhaps', 'sign', 'times', 'cobbling', 'together', 'diverse', 'cast', 'characters', 'become', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'Rise', 'Guardians', 'trend', 'turning', 'dial', 'iconic', 'characters', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Sandman', 'up', '11', 'characters', 'gift', 'children', 'turn', 'children', 'believe', 'form', 'immortality', 'oddly', 'parasitic', 'relationship', 'was', 'prominent', 'Wizard', 'Coast', 'Primal', 'Order', 'supplement', 'deities', 'need', 'worshippers', 'gain', 'power', 'heroes', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'powerful', 'are', 'certainly', 'popular', 'least', 'are.One', 'questions', 'weighing', 'mind', 'bringing', 'five-year-old', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'Rise', 'would', 'deal', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'one', 'thing', 'question', 'existence', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'never', 'liked', 'anyway', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'anyone', 'believe', 'Sandman', 'pretty', 'sure', 'NOBODY', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'tricky', 'turf', 'right', 'there.Parents', 'need', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Santa', 'jovial', 'dual', 'saber-wielding', 'slavic', 'warrior', 'full', 'wisdom', 'jolly', 'humor', 'generosity', 'voiced', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Santa', 'can', 'get', 'board', 'Sandman', ""n't"", 'speak', 'thought-forms', 'lend', 'well', '3-D', 'viewing.The', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'voiced', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'oddly', 'natural', 'combative', 'boomerang-wielding', 'humanoid', 'rabbit', 'can', 'throw', 'egg-smoke', 'bombs', 'ninja', 'also', 'pretty', 'adorable.Isla', 'Fisher', 'yes', 'nymphomaniac', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'neurotic', 'workaholic', 'who', 'been', 'field', 'so', 'long', 'longer', 'how', 'relate', 'kids', 'also', 'moons', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'AKA', 'Captain', 'Kirk', '.Frost', 'teenager', 'bunch', 'frustrated', 'lack', 'fame', 'literally', 'invisible', 'children', 'Frost', 'personal', 'journey', 'discover', 'how', 'became', 'who', 'doing', 'so', 'accepting', 'role', 'new', 'Guardian', 'children.And', 'what', 'Guardians', 'secretly', 'aging', 'gracefully', 'parenthood', 'older', 'adults', 'existing', 'Guardians', 'worry', 'being', 'forgotten', 'uninvolved', 'children', 'lives', 'Pitch', 'Boogeyman', 'voiced', 'unctuous', 'Jude', 'Law', 'attention', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'just', 'be', 'feared', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'Frost', 'deal', 'own', 'childhood', 'can', 'become', 'parent.There', 'are', 'amazing', 'set', 'pieces', 'plenty', 'clever', 'quips', 'enough', 'magical', 'battles', 'keep', 'movie', 'clicking', 'along', 'Frost', 'something', 'bland', 'catch-all', 'rebellious', 'cool', 'kid', 'history', 'movies', 'hoodie', 'MUST', 'be', 'cool', 'big', 'revelation', 'past', ""n't"", 'much', 'revelation', 'Rise', 'Guardians', 'clearly', 'just', 'getting', 'beginning', 'launch', 'franchise', 'good', 'start', ""'ll"", 'take', 'movie', 'just', 'good', 'ole', 'sword-swinging', 'Claus', 'day']",Rise of the Guardians: Easter Gift Set

Truly, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, animated or otherwise.Being someone who, at 19, still believes wholeheartedly and without shame in the ""Big Three"" (Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny), I quickly became a fan of William Joyce's excellent series-in-the-making ""The Guardians of Childhood"", which attempts to give a history to some of the most beloved legendary figures, including the lesser-known Sandman, Jack Frost, and of course, the Bogeyman himself, named, what else, Pitch Black. The film occurs some 300 or so years after the books, and deals with the Guardian's need for a new member to help them in their fight against Pitch as he attempts to corrupt the children of the world's dreams by turning them into nightmares and in the process squelching their belief in the Guardians at all, in an effort to take over.While on the surface an adventure film, at its heart, it is a tale about discovering who you are, what gift we as individuals can contribute to the world, the awesome power of belief, and the importance of keeping our childlike sense of wonder alive. No, this isn't like your typical DreamWorks picture, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The storyline is superbly well crafted and never once loses its focus, and the avoidance of humor that relies on crude and suggestive humor and already-dated pop culture refererences gives it an irresistibly timeless feel. While there are many serious moments (I was brought to tears many times), the film is also just plain fun, a delightful joyride that deserves the designation of a family film more than most others produced nowadays.All of the characters are wonderfully unique, with their own distinct personalities, further enhanced by the fabulous acting jobs of all-star actors including Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, Jude Law, and Hugh Jackman. While they might be tweaked a bit from the original stories, they retain the overall essence of each Guardian (For example, the Easter Bunny, instead of the stuffy, egg-obsessed Pooka he is in the book, is now a tough, no-nonsense Aussie).It's a real shame that this gem of a movie was considered a box-office failure upon its release and was subsequently made a scapegoat for DreamWork's current financial difficulties, because it is so well done and has so much to offer. With a great story, a beautiful message, gorgeous animation, and a great voice cast, I can't think of a way to possibly make it any better than it is.",5,A Truly Magical Experience for Anyone Who Believes,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,2863,"['once', 'while', 'truly', 'special', 'film', 'expectations', 'what', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'wonder', 'why', 'one', 'ever', 'thought', 'doing', 'something', 'worthy', 'effort', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Peter', 'Ramsey', 'Rise', 'Guardians', 'once', 'epic', 'touching', 'exciting', 'heartwarming', 'times', 'quite', 'scary', 'short', 'everything', 'good', 'movie', 'Truly', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'animated', 'otherwise.Being', 'someone', 'who', '19', 'still', 'wholeheartedly', 'shame', 'Big', 'Three', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'quickly', 'became', 'fan', 'William', 'Joyce', 'excellent', 'series-in-the-making', 'Guardians', 'Childhood', 'give', 'history', 'most', 'beloved', 'legendary', 'figures', 'including', 'lesser-known', 'Sandman', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'course', 'Bogeyman', 'named', 'what', 'else', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'film', '300', 'so', 'years', 'books', 'deals', 'Guardian', 'need', 'new', 'member', 'help', 'fight', 'Pitch', 'corrupt', 'children', 'world', 'dreams', 'turning', 'nightmares', 'process', 'squelching', 'belief', 'Guardians', 'effort', 'take', 'over.While', 'surface', 'adventure', 'film', 'heart', 'tale', 'discovering', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'gift', 'individuals', 'can', 'contribute', 'world', 'awesome', 'power', 'belief', 'importance', 'keeping', 'childlike', 'sense', 'wonder', 'alive', 'No', ""n't"", 'typical', 'DreamWorks', 'picture', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'storyline', 'superbly', 'well', 'crafted', 'never', 'once', 'focus', 'avoidance', 'humor', 'crude', 'suggestive', 'humor', 'already-dated', 'pop', 'culture', 'irresistibly', 'timeless', 'feel', 'are', 'many', 'serious', 'moments', 'was', 'brought', 'tears', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'also', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'delightful', 'joyride', 'designation', 'family', 'film', 'more', 'most', 'others', 'produced', 'nowadays.All', 'characters', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'unique', 'own', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'further', 'enhanced', 'fabulous', 'acting', 'jobs', 'all-star', 'actors', 'including', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'might', 'be', 'tweaked', 'bit', 'original', 'stories', 'retain', 'overall', 'essence', 'Guardian', 'example', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'instead', 'stuffy', 'egg-obsessed', 'Pooka', 'book', 'now', 'tough', 'no-nonsense', 'Aussie', '.It', 'real', 'shame', 'gem', 'movie', 'was', 'considered', 'box-office', 'failure', 'release', 'was', 'subsequently', 'made', 'scapegoat', 'DreamWork', 'current', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'offer', 'great', 'story', 'beautiful', 'message', 'gorgeous', 'animation', 'great', 'voice', 'cast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'way', 'possibly', 'make', 'better']",Rise of the Guardians: Easter Gift Set

1485554,A1KY25HG3D9NWB,B005LAIIFS,"PghDrake ""PghDrake""","[0, 0]","Overall I personally liked this movie a lot. Watched it with my 17-year old son and we both enjoyed it equally.Just feel that I should warn folks that maybe don't know that there's a bit of violence in it. No blood or gore of course, but Santa is walking around with 2 swords and ""killing"" scary horses made out of the stuff of nightmares, the Easter Bunny is doing the same with a boomerang and so on. It also touches a little bit on death in the story line, but I won't post a spoiler with the details.The gist of the story line is cute if a little formulaic. The boogeyman (named Pitch Black) is trying to get kids to not believe in the Guardians (Santa, Easter Bunny, Sandman and Tooth Fairy) by giving them nightmares. The Man in the Moon (or, as I see it, their representation of God) suggests that the Guardians let Jack Frost (a mischievous teenager who can fly, has various abilities around ice and cold and who has no idea of his past) join their team to help them. I'll outline the characters below so you can see how different they are from the norm:Santa is Russian and has tattoos on his arms (""Naughty"" on one, ""Nice"" on the other). He also has Yeti working for him in the shops as well as elves (tiny critters who generally aren't as helpful as generally believed). Not your typical Santa as he's more of a ""tough guy"" but they do point out his gentle side and love for children and the ""wonder"" in all things.The Easter Bunny is over 6' tall and has a bit of an attitude. He travels by making magical tunnels in the ground that lead to wherever he wants. He wields a boomerang and has an Australian accent. He starts off the movie not liking the idea of having Jack Frost join them (thinks he's just a trouble maker).The Tooth Fairy is a bird-like woman who has thousands of little birds actually taking teeth and leaving rewards for children. These teeth hold the memories of the children in them so she safeguards them closely.The Sandman never actually talks, communicates with his ability to shape magic (sand/the stuff of dreams/whatever) into different forms. Like when he is curious about something, a question mark will form above his head, etc. Interesting character, probably my favorite of the Guardians.Jack Frost has a magical staff/stick that he uses to fly with and to shape/manipulate cold, ice, snow, etc. He likes to roam around and be mischievous, but he also has a strong love of children and enjoys giving them snow days, making their sled riding more fun and adventurous, etc. Nobody can see Jack Frost though, like they can see the other Guardians if they aren't careful.The Boogeyman (Pitch Black) is a tall, dark, brooding character that can manipulate children's dreams and make them nightmares. His arch-enemy, while he of course works against any of the Guardians) is clearly the Sandman for obvious reasons. His goal is to get children to stop believing in the Guardians because if nobody believes in them any more then they lose their powers.Overall the characters are well done and interesting, but quite different from the ""norm"" as you can see. If they weren't it wouldn't be a movie!I recommend the movie, just suggest you consider the non-bloody violence if you are concerned about your child(ren) watching that.-D",5,Great movie,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,3266,"['Overall', 'personally', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'Watched', '17-year', 'old', 'son', 'enjoyed', 'feel', 'should', 'warn', 'folks', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'bit', 'violence', 'blood', 'gore', 'course', 'Santa', 'walking', 'around', '2', 'swords', 'killing', 'scary', 'horses', 'made', 'stuff', 'nightmares', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'doing', 'same', 'boomerang', 'so', 'also', 'little', 'bit', 'death', 'story', 'line', 'wo', ""n't"", 'post', 'spoiler', 'details.The', 'gist', 'story', 'line', 'cute', 'little', 'formulaic', 'boogeyman', 'named', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'trying', 'get', 'kids', 'not', 'believe', 'Guardians', 'Santa', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'Sandman', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'giving', 'nightmares', 'Man', 'Moon', 'see', 'representation', 'God', 'Guardians', 'let', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'mischievous', 'teenager', 'who', 'can', 'fly', 'various', 'abilities', 'ice', 'cold', 'who', 'idea', 'past', 'join', 'team', 'help', ""'ll"", 'outline', 'characters', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'different', 'are', 'norm', 'Santa', 'Russian', 'tattoos', 'arms', 'Naughty', 'one', 'Nice', 'other', 'also', 'Yeti', 'working', 'shops', 'as', 'well', 'elves', 'tiny', 'critters', 'who', 'generally', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'helpful', 'generally', 'believed', 'Not', 'typical', 'Santa', 'more', 'tough', 'guy', 'do', 'point', 'out', 'gentle', 'side', 'love', 'children', 'wonder', 'things.The', 'Easter', 'Bunny', '6', 'tall', 'bit', 'attitude', 'making', 'magical', 'tunnels', 'ground', 'lead', 'wherever', 'boomerang', 'Australian', 'accent', 'movie', 'not', 'liking', 'idea', 'having', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'join', 'just', 'trouble', 'maker', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'bird-like', 'woman', 'who', 'thousands', 'little', 'birds', 'actually', 'taking', 'teeth', 'leaving', 'rewards', 'children', 'teeth', 'hold', 'memories', 'children', 'so', 'closely.The', 'Sandman', 'never', 'actually', 'talks', 'communicates', 'ability', 'shape', 'magic', 'sand/the', 'stuff', 'dreams/whatever', 'different', 'forms', 'when', 'curious', 'something', 'question', 'mark', 'will', 'form', 'head', 'etc', 'Interesting', 'character', 'probably', 'favorite', 'Guardians.Jack', 'Frost', 'magical', 'staff/stick', 'fly', 'shape/manipulate', 'cold', 'ice', 'snow', 'etc', 'roam', 'be', 'mischievous', 'also', 'strong', 'love', 'children', 'giving', 'snow', 'days', 'making', 'sled', 'riding', 'more', 'fun', 'adventurous', 'etc', 'Nobody', 'can', 'see', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'Guardians', 'are', ""n't"", 'careful.The', 'Boogeyman', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'tall', 'dark', 'brooding', 'character', 'can', 'manipulate', 'children', 'dreams', 'make', 'nightmares', 'arch-enemy', 'course', 'works', 'Guardians', 'clearly', 'Sandman', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'goal', 'get', 'children', 'stop', 'believing', 'Guardians', 'nobody', 'more', 'then', 'lose', 'powers.Overall', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'interesting', 'quite', 'different', 'norm', 'can', 'see', 'were', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'recommend', 'movie', 'just', 'suggest', 'consider', 'non-bloody', 'violence', 'are', 'concerned', 'child', 'ren', 'watching', 'that.-D']",Rise of the Guardians: Easter Gift Set

The reason was simple: all of the studio's ads and marketing made it clear that this was aimed at little kids. Funny thing, though...when those little kids and their parents went to see it, they weren't too pleased; and, the movie underperformed at the box office.After watching it at home, its easy to understand why:This is an action movie, with some serious themes (death, self-image, resurrection, revenge), and a particularly scary villain.As such, it would have scared the daylights out of most tots. However, my kids and I found the animation imaginative, the concept of Holiday-Icon-As-Superhero to be refreshing, the voice acting superb and the action set-pieces to be stirring.That said, there is a real problem with the film's own self-image. It veers wildly from giddy/silly into (very) dark/dangerous and back again; and, often without a logical reason why. Had the film spent more time telling its story, instead of trying to simply entertain, it might have been a classic.Regardless, this is a worthwhile investment for any fan of good animated movies and/or their kids (ages 10 & up).Chris Pine and Jude Law (as Jack Frost and Pitch Black the Boogieman) bring depth and emotion to their characterizations; and, both Alec Baldwin and Hugh Jackman are a scream in their roles of North (Santa) and the Easter Bunny.I strongly recommend 'Rise of the Guardians'",4,"Although marketed as a 'kiddie' film, this is a lot of fun for tweens and up!",1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,1532,"['When', ""'Rise"", 'Guardians', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', '10', 'year-old', 'daughter', '16', 'year-old', 'son', 'declined', 'chance', 'see', 'being', 'animation', 'junkies', 'reason', 'was', 'simple', 'studio', 'ads', 'marketing', 'made', 'clear', 'was', 'aimed', 'little', 'kids', 'Funny', 'thing', 'when', 'little', 'kids', 'parents', 'went', 'see', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'pleased', 'movie', 'underperformed', 'box', 'office.After', 'watching', 'home', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'action', 'movie', 'serious', 'themes', 'death', 'self-image', 'resurrection', 'revenge', 'particularly', 'scary', 'villain.As', 'such', 'would', 'have', 'scared', 'daylights', 'most', 'tots', 'However', 'kids', 'found', 'animation', 'imaginative', 'concept', 'Holiday-Icon-As-Superhero', 'be', 'refreshing', 'voice', 'acting', 'superb', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'be', 'stirring.That', 'said', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'own', 'self-image', 'wildly', 'giddy/silly', 'very', 'dark/dangerous', 'back', 'again', 'often', 'logical', 'reason', 'why', 'Had', 'film', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'telling', 'story', 'instead', 'trying', 'simply', 'entertain', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'classic.Regardless', 'worthwhile', 'investment', 'fan', 'good', 'animated', 'movies', 'and/or', 'kids', '10', 'up', '.Chris', 'Pine', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Boogieman', 'bring', 'depth', 'emotion', 'characterizations', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'are', 'scream', 'roles', 'North', 'Santa', 'Easter', 'Bunny.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', ""'Rise"", 'Guardians']",Rise of the Guardians: Easter Gift Set

I felt like I was in the same room as the scenes. The snowflakes come right at you and make you feel like it is really snowing on you. The man in the moon needs the help of The Guardians to defeat the evil pitch. The Guardians are amazing. The animators and writers do a stupendous job of creating believable characters. The Guardians consist of Santa, who is from Russia - He is jolly and lives in an amazing castle. He has the cutest elves with jingle bells on their heads. They are very funny and helpful. The Easter bunny - who is tough, from Australia and has a boomerang. His adorable eggs actually have legs and can run around. The Tooth Fairy is very different; she is a bird. She has pink wings and blue and green feathers. Her baby birds that help her are the sweetest little creatures. The Sandman is the one who makes all your dreams come true while you are sleeping.The graphics for his amazing talents are fabulous. Jack Frost is one of my favorites. Everything he touches turn into frost. The animation of the frost covering everything is absolutely beautiful. Pitch wants the world to be dark and sad and to lose all hope. The children keep the world safe by having hope. Santa has a magic globe which is bright with lights as long as the children believe but once they stop believing their light goes out. The intricate design of the scenery is the best I have ever seen. Everything, from smallest detail to the large wondering dinosaurs, is breath taking.This movie is humorous, adorable and magical. My favorite scenes are when the Easter Bunny goes on a sleigh ride with Santa Clause and when the baby eggs are running around. The Sandman's magic makes your heart glow. The message is to stop and find out what makes you special. You have to find out what it is that you do best and find your center so you know how to make yourself and others happy.I loved this movie that mixes up holidays so you can watch it year round and get into the mood for the seasons. I recommend this for ages 6 and up. Pitch is frightening. The oversized Santa might be too much for the little ones because I am not joking he looks like you are right next to him. I give this movie 5 out 5 twinkling stars. Morgan B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.A magical movie with all your favorite childhood Guardians who come together to protect the children. Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Sandman and Jack Frost (Chris Pine) are chosen by the Man in the Moon to guard the children. They make sure that all children have wonderful dreams and faith. The more the children believe in the Guardians the more power they have. However, the Boogieman (Jude Law) rises to take over the sweet dreams and create nightmares and children begin to lose faith in the Guardians. Without faith or belief, the Guardians will disappear, the lights will turn off and the earth will be filled with darkness. This is when the Guardians join forces to fight the Boogieman. However, Jack Frost does not join forces to fight. He just wants to have fun and not worry about anything.There are so many funny lines in this movie. My favorite part is when the Tooth Fairy looks at the collection of teeth; she knows which one flosses and exactly who it belongs to. I did not like the Boogieman because he seems so real and I don't want to see him when I sleep. The 3D special effects in this movie are so clear; they are unbelievable. When Jack Frost is flying it feels like you are flying with him and you can actually feel the cold air. The rivers of colors are so bright and clear. However, the music is so-so - not very exciting. The lesson in this movie is find your passion and you will know your purpose in life. The costumes are so awesome, especially the Fairies and Santa and his elves. The message in this movie is that joining forces can be more powerful than being by yourself. My favorite character is Jack Frost. He's very fun.I rank this movie 4 out of 5 stars. I give this age range 3 and up. Cheyenne N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.This movie is awesome. It has a lot of action, a lot of funny parts, and I guess there could be some parts that can be seen as scary too. This movie is all about a guy named Jack Frost who came out of the ice but no one believes in him and so no one can see him. So he is turned into a guardian because the moon chooses him. Kind of strange, right? Well he was chosen to help save the world. He meets a lot of other guardians too but they aren't very nice at first so he isn't sure if he wants to be a guardian! Some of the main characters in the movie are Jack Frost, North, Tooth, Bunny, Pitch, and Jamie.My favorite characters are Jack Frost and Jamie because Jack Frost doesn't want to be a guardian at first but then he fights Pitch and decides he would like to help the world which I like. Jaime is a good boy who believes in the guardians no matter what. He loves to have fun like me, so that proves he is a good character. I hope you like them as much as I do. My favorite part in the movie is when Jack Frost sees his memories because he learns that he had a sister and he saved her from falling in the ice. Sadly he didn't make it and fell into the ice. I felt so bad that he didn't make it but it was good that he saved his sister.I would recommend this movie for ages 4 and up. Pitch can be a little scary at times but I love the movie and there isn't too much to be scared about. Go out and see this movie in theaters on November 21. Anthony A, KIDS FIRST!

And introducing stories about Sandman and Jack Frost, about whom so little is known anyway, really gives them personality. As an adult (a really old...OLD...adult), I appreciated this movie on many different levels, but most especially it gave me an excuse to still believe!In Rise of the Guardians, Santa is still jolly but he's seen to really be involved in INSURING the innocence and goodness in children, rather than just rewarding them by chance. It makes Santa seem more personal, to me.As for the Easter bunny, well, fluffy bunnies are cute, but to have a 'tough guy', Australian hopper who is in cahoots with Santa in keeping the &#34;child&#34; in childhood is pretty cool, too! I mean, I love Peter Cottontail to death, but as an adult I can appreciate this version!Sandman has always been a vague, benign sort of tradition. I like that this character is all cute and squoodgie...with a piece of iron at his core when provoked. The Tooth Fairy (and all her little 'Baby Teeth'!) make me wish I could put my false teeth under my pillow to see if I could fool them and catch a glimpse in the wee hours!!!  But Jack Frost...wow. There's a whole new story for us all. Or maybe that story is from a different cultural tradition, I don't know. What I do know is that when he caught up with his former life memories, I cried.All in all, I really loved this movie. I watched it with my two of my granddaughters, ages 4 and 2 1/2. They were spellbound! However, I think this movie is best left to the older children who are on the verge of losing those beliefs to impending adulthood.

ParaNorman, Hotel Transylvania, Frankenweenie, Brave, just to name a few. Rise of the Guardians, which is based on William Joyce's multi-book young adult series, is one of the best. I can't say that I have every kid's anime film made, but my movie collection includes plenty and I've been known to watch them on Saturday mornings instead of the cartoon fare.Casting was well done. The voices fit their characters and it's obvious the actors were into their roles. Animation brought life to the screen. I saw this film in the theaters and immediately went searching for a pre-order. I've actually started reading the books as well.

And the movie worked. 2012 has been a really good year for animation, Pirates: A Band of Misfits, Brave, Hotel Transylvania, Madagascar 3, and of course Wreck it Ralph, were all very entertaining animated films this year.

He froze to death, which is a pretty depressing. And then he's brought back to life as Jack Frost, no memories of his family, sister, and his past. The Pit Blacks villain plane was flaws and for a moment I would have liked to see him win but only for a moment. The only problem I had with it was how Pit Black looked liked. He's spouse to be Oogie Boogie but he doesn't look scary, I thought he would look a little like Nightmare Before Christmas Boogie Man but he looks like a high, pedophile vampire who walked on to the wrong set. Every one else was designed wonderfully. Everyone looked like they took there time even for simple characters like the kids and the dark sleeping dust well created. You could tell they put a lot of time and effort in to all that. But Pit Black's character was simple and boring. And don't give me this &#34;its a kids movie, hes not spouse to look scary&#34;. May I remind you that Jack Frost was killed by falling in to a frozen lake and freezing to death. That's pretty dark even for a kids movie. So why didn't they make him look a little scary.

1485683,A3M17XG8HL7JRF,B005LAIIFS,"Who Am I? ""Me!""","[0, 0]","That's the moral of this story in a nut-shell.  Religion is a controversial topic, but this movie manages to speak of the power of faith without bringing in the controversy.  Here  the Guardian angels of earth are not the various religious prophets of the various religions of the world... or even the &#34;guardian angels&#34; of Christian Faith of one wishes to see it that way.. no these guardians are Santa Claus, The Sand Man, Jack Frost, The tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny.  They have all come together to defeat doubt and fear- in the form of the Boogie Man.  Who of coarse is played by a Brit because as we all know by know by know every villian must be British. :)  Since most religions do not have a devil it makes more sense to see the Boogie Man as simply a representation of doubt.Jack Frost like we humans, wants to know Why he is here.  He asks the Moon (which can easily be thought of as God) why he put him there, but the moon, like god does not answer him.  Instead the few times the Moon does speak it does so using signs rather than words.  The Guardians try to recruit Jack.  Their main function is protect the world by instilling and maintaining faith which helps to combat the doubt and fear that would otherwise rule people's lives.  Jack doesn't see how he can instill faith in others when no one has faith in him.  Santa tells him that he doesn't get to choose his role in this life because it is the moon that chose it for all of them including Jack.At one point someone asks Jack how they can keep believing in the Guardians when they can't see them and Jack replies by asking 'When clouds cover the sun do you stop believing in the Sun?  Just because you can't see us doesn't mean we won't always be there.  And now we will always be inside of you... and that in a sense makes you a guardian too.'
