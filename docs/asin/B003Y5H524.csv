1371938,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003Y5H524,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","This was a very welcomed surprise.  Instead of constantly shooting for awkwardly un-funny off-color remarks, one after the other, or just merely yelling at everyone all the time, Adam Sandler and company crafted a nicely woven film that is sweet, smart and funny.  This has a LOT to do with the fact that Jennifer Aniston is flawless here.  Sandler is apparently the type of guy that needs a strong woman at his side in order to anchor his films.  When he relies on his fellow male comedians his films fall to pieces, but his collaborations with the likes of Drew Barrymore and now Aniston have proven that his over-the-topness can be tamed by the fairer sex.In `Just Go With It', Sandler plays a plastic surgeon who had his heart trampled on when he was younger and has vowed to never get married.  When he discovered that drunk women tend to react kindly (and often passionately) to a married man with a horrible wife he started wearing a wedding ring and spewing sob stories to pick up chicks.  Then he meets a bombshell and falls, instantly, in love with her.  He doesn't even want to lie to her because after one magical evening in the sand the two decide that this could be something `real'.  But then she finds his fake wedding ring in his pant pocket and he has to come up with some sort of lie in order to keep her interested in him, so he convinces his assistant to pretend to be his `soon to be ex' wife, and then suddenly her kids become his kids and his cousin becomes her new lover and they all wind up in Hawaii where things just spiral out of control until...Well, I'm sure you'll figure out within the first few minutes who is going to wind up with who.So, this film is swimming in chemistry.  That is one thing that really made this so worth watching.  Adam Sandler tones down his crudeness in order to keep up with the classy humor surrounding Aniston.  She is a total star here, and really, it's shocking to say that this is one of her finer performances.  I just loved the way she sunk into the `genre' without losing a sense of realism.  She is sharp and witty and aggressive, yet you always can see the subtle lines of longing in her eyes; that longing for normalcy in happiness.  Swardson is hilarious with an accent (and that sheep scene is priceless), Kidman is insanely manic, but in a good way, Bailee Madison is adoreable and has deft comedic timing that I'm sure she'll hone well.  Brooklyn has spotty moments of green acting, and then she recovers, but she's not hot enough to persuade eyes away from Aniston, who is a knockout here.Best I've ever seen her.At the end of the day, this is a predictable romp (and the ending is lazily put together in a rush attempt to tie up all loose strings), but it's heartwarming and quite funny.  In fact, I laughed from beginning to end, and they were genuine laughs that I'm anxious to revisit!",4,It's been a long time since I've laughed at an Adam Sandler film...,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,2864,"['was', 'very', 'welcomed', 'surprise', 'Instead', 'constantly', 'shooting', 'awkwardly', 'un-funny', 'off-color', 'remarks', 'one', 'other', 'just', 'merely', 'yelling', 'everyone', 'time', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'company', 'crafted', 'nicely', 'woven', 'film', 'sweet', 'smart', 'funny', 'LOT', 'do', 'fact', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'flawless', 'here', 'Sandler', 'apparently', 'type', 'guy', 'strong', 'woman', 'side', 'order', 'anchor', 'films', 'When', 'fellow', 'male', 'films', 'fall', 'pieces', 'collaborations', 'likes', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'now', 'Aniston', 'have', 'proven', 'over-the-topness', 'can', 'be', 'tamed', 'fairer', 'sex.In', 'Just', 'Go', 'Sandler', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'who', 'had', 'heart', 'trampled', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'vowed', 'never', 'get', 'married', 'When', 'discovered', 'drunk', 'women', 'tend', 'react', 'kindly', 'often', 'passionately', 'married', 'man', 'horrible', 'wife', 'started', 'wearing', 'wedding', 'ring', 'spewing', 'sob', 'stories', 'pick', 'up', 'chicks', 'Then', 'bombshell', 'falls', 'instantly', 'love', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'lie', 'one', 'magical', 'evening', 'sand', 'two', 'decide', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'real', 'then', 'fake', 'wedding', 'ring', 'pant', 'pocket', 'come', 'up', 'sort', 'lie', 'order', 'keep', 'interested', 'so', 'assistant', 'pretend', 'be', 'soon', 'be', 'ex', 'wife', 'then', 'suddenly', 'kids', 'become', 'kids', 'cousin', 'new', 'lover', 'wind', 'up', 'Hawaii', 'where', 'things', 'just', 'spiral', 'control', 'Well', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'out', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'who', 'going', 'wind', 'up', 'who.So', 'film', 'swimming', 'chemistry', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'made', 'so', 'worth', 'watching', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'down', 'crudeness', 'order', 'keep', 'up', 'classy', 'humor', 'surrounding', 'Aniston', 'total', 'star', 'here', 'really', 'shocking', 'say', 'one', 'finer', 'performances', 'just', 'loved', 'way', 'sunk', 'genre', 'losing', 'sense', 'realism', 'sharp', 'witty', 'aggressive', 'yet', 'always', 'can', 'see', 'subtle', 'lines', 'longing', 'eyes', 'longing', 'normalcy', 'happiness', 'Swardson', 'hilarious', 'accent', 'sheep', 'scene', 'priceless', 'Kidman', 'insanely', 'manic', 'good', 'way', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'adoreable', 'deft', 'comedic', 'timing', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'hone', 'well', 'Brooklyn', 'spotty', 'moments', 'green', 'acting', 'then', 'recovers', 'not', 'hot', 'enough', 'persuade', 'eyes', 'away', 'Aniston', 'who', 'knockout', 'here.Best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'end', 'day', 'predictable', 'romp', 'ending', 'lazily', 'put', 'together', 'rush', 'attempt', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'strings', 'heartwarming', 'quite', 'funny', 'fact', 'laughed', 'beginning', 'end', 'were', 'genuine', 'laughs', ""'m"", 'anxious', 'revisit']",N/A

To try for humor someone had to be mugging for the camera, talking potty humor, acting so strange that in reality, they would go into a mental institution, nothing genuinely funny.The strained movie plot is that Adam Sandler is about to get married and finds out his girl is cheating on him. He goes to a bar and gets lucky by lying about his not actual wife. Apparently, according to Sandler, this makes women want you more. So after years of pretending to have a wife, he meets the girl of his dreams and has to get a real wife. Lucky for him his medical assistant, Jennifer Aniston, is willing to do this for him. Ok sure fine whatever. The movie is over right? No.. for some bizzaro reason the whole group (including Aniston's kids) head down to some tropic beach resort. Now that is where the movie lost me. How could anyone take that much time off, never mind a doctor, his assistant, and her kids. Um... school?  The movie just goes off the tracks here into silly skit like things that happen: including a man trying to give a sheep CPR, a child going #2 on someone's hand, and a bizzare dance contest with Nicole Kidman. And despite a lot of things going wrong it never dawns on the love of Sandler's life that there is something wrong here.I guess, we are supposed to believe that Sandler and Aniston fall in love, but um, you must have acting in order to have anyone buy this and Sandler can't act.

However, I as well as the 4 other people who saw it with me found it uproariously funny and sometimes even sweet.  I really enjoy Adam Sandler in most of his films, and although this is a comedy, in this role he also displayed his sweet side much like he did in the Wedding Singer.  He is actually a very good and expressive actor whose dramatic chops are underrated in many ways.  And of course, I am a huge fan of the wonderful Jennifer Aniston, and she did a superb job here.  There were also some other surprises....Brooklyn Decker was sweet, likable and relatable even beyond her obvious physical attributes.  Nicole Kidman showed up in a character who was a bit over the top, but being a huge fan of her as well, I enjoyed this turn as we don't get to see her do comedy that often.  Not every role needs to be deadly serious, after all.  She had a lot of fun with this one and she was great to watch.  Dave Matthews played her husband, and he was surprisingly good as well...perhaps he has a new career ahead of him in films.  The only character that was too over the top and a bit obnoxious was the fellow who played Adam's long-time friend.  Nothing about this guy was at all believable or particularly likable and you wanted to just swat him away as he was just downright silly and annoying, and he didn't really add much to the plot except as a necessary diversion device here and there.  The Hawaii scenery (a lot of it filmed around and in the Grand Wailea in Maui) was beautiful, of course.  I don't really want to get overly picky about this film.  It was not meant to be highbrow cinema, but it was consistently funny and very enjoyable, definitely a film I plan to buy when it is released on DVD.

And I am always leery of watching films with him in it with my teenagers because you never know how inappropriate it will be. There is inappropriate funny and then there is inappropriate awkward. But I didn't watch this film with my teens so I wasn't really paying attention to that.Sandler has been in a lot of duds, as has Jennifer Aniston, but I must say that I enjoyed them in this. Though I didn't have high expectations. Actually, I had no expectations at all.The movie is about a womanizing plastic surgeon, Danny (Adam Sandler), who falls for someone much younger than him (Palmer boringly and annoyingly played by Brooklyn Decker) but ends up getting trapped by his fibs. So, somewhat unbelievably, he, Palmer, his supposed ex-wife Katherine, well-played by Jennifer Aniston, her two kids and his friend, zanily and irritatingly played by Nick Swardson (to the point where I was cringing), all end up going to Hawaii together. Nicole Kidman plays Katherine's university rival Devlin, but I don't really care for her in this. I didn't realize until the end that Devlin's husband was played by singer/musician Dave Matthews; not really much to say about his character.The start of the film is ok but it gets funnier. Even though it ends up being cliched, I must say that I did enjoy it. It was funny in parts and touching in parts. But my husband would have hated it.To me, the star of this movie was Bailee Madison who plays Maggie, Katherine's daughter.

1371976,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B003Y5H524,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 9]","There is no getting around the fact that Jennifer Aniston is likeable. In the past, she has attempted to be versatile with mixed results (effective inThe Good Girl, less so as a temptress inDerailed), but she remains most successful within a limited proximity of her Rachel Green character from the long-runningFriendsTV series. She's playing another variation of her in this rambunctious 2011 comedy ever so loosely based on the amiable 1969 farce,Cactus Flowerstarring Walter Matthau, Ingrid Bergman, and Goldie Hawn in her Oscar-winning debut. Believe it or not, Aniston is playing the Bergman role of Katherine, a single mom working as an assistant to Danny, a successful LA plastic surgeon played by Adam Sandler. The fact that Sandler is playing the Matthau role appears to be the primary joke here since he turns the excessively inventive single doctor into one of his standard wiseacre man-boy characters.Directed by Sandler's regular handler Dennis Dugan, the movie opens with a flashback scene in which a pre-nose-job Danny discovers he is about to marry a shrew but soon realizes his gold band is a magnet for hot chicks. He then decides to avoid what he thinks is the inevitable disappointment of commitment by telling every girl he hooks up with that he's married. That ploy changes when he meets a blonde stunner named Palmer. He falls for her, but things start to fall apart when she discovers Danny's gold band in his pocket and assumes he's married. Convinced that Palmer is the one, Danny persuades Katherine to pretend to be his soon-to-be-ex-wife and uses her two manipulative kids as part of the charade. Things go according to formula, including a contrived trip to Hawaii where Katherine runs into a college sorority rival named Devlin, who has been the subject of Katherine's passive-aggressive hostilities all these years. In a bit of stunt casting, Nicole Kidman plays the ultra-competitive Devlin in a comically imperious fashion, while singer/musician Dave Matthews is arbitrarily thrown in the mix as her equally shallow, butt-clenching husband.Even though this comedy is neither as consistently funny nor tightly structured as ""Cactus Flower"", I have to admit there is a bit of a Cary Grant/Irene Dunne-type of banter between Aniston and Sandler, at least during the first half when Katherine is introduced to Palmer as Danny's confident, materialistic wife (she names herself ""Devlin""). These are the scenes that hew closest to the original movie and consequently work the best. Where it flounders is when the two actors need to show they are falling in love. Sandler is a relative blank slate during these more serious moments, and the lack of credibility in their characters' romantic relationship undermines the film. In the Goldie Hawn role, Brooklyn Decker fulfills the physical requirements as Palmer but is unlikely to be up for any Oscars this time next year. Nick Swardson wins my award for the year's most irritating best buddy in a Sandler comedy, especially when he pretends to be Katherine's lover, an Austrian sheep buyer. Sandler's former SNL colleagues Rachel Dratch and an almost unrecognizable Kevin Nealon show up in cameos as two comically unfortunate victims of plastic surgery.",3,Deception-Based Farce Gone Through the Sandler Blender,1299283200,"03 5, 2011",2011,3230,"['getting', 'fact', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'likeable', 'past', 'attempted', 'be', 'versatile', 'mixed', 'results', 'effective', 'inThe', 'Good', 'Girl', 'less', 'so', 'temptress', 'inDerailed', 'most', 'successful', 'limited', 'proximity', 'Rachel', 'Green', 'character', 'long-runningFriendsTV', 'series', 'playing', 'variation', 'rambunctious', '2011', 'comedy', 'ever', 'so', 'loosely', 'based', 'amiable', '1969', 'farce', 'Cactus', 'Flowerstarring', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Oscar-winning', 'debut', 'Believe', 'not', 'Aniston', 'playing', 'Bergman', 'role', 'Katherine', 'single', 'mom', 'working', 'assistant', 'Danny', 'successful', 'LA', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'played', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fact', 'Sandler', 'playing', 'Matthau', 'role', 'be', 'primary', 'joke', 'here', 'excessively', 'inventive', 'single', 'doctor', 'one', 'standard', 'wiseacre', 'man-boy', 'characters.Directed', 'Sandler', 'regular', 'handler', 'Dennis', 'Dugan', 'movie', 'flashback', 'scene', 'pre-nose-job', 'Danny', 'discovers', 'marry', 'shrew', 'soon', 'gold', 'band', 'magnet', 'hot', 'chicks', 'then', 'avoid', 'what', 'inevitable', 'disappointment', 'commitment', 'telling', 'girl', 'up', 'married', 'ploy', 'changes', 'when', 'blonde', 'stunner', 'named', 'Palmer', 'things', 'start', 'fall', 'apart', 'when', 'Danny', 'gold', 'band', 'pocket', 'married', 'Convinced', 'Palmer', 'one', 'Danny', 'Katherine', 'pretend', 'be', 'soon-to-be-ex-wife', 'two', 'manipulative', 'kids', 'part', 'charade', 'Things', 'go', 'according', 'formula', 'including', 'contrived', 'trip', 'Hawaii', 'where', 'Katherine', 'college', 'sorority', 'rival', 'named', 'Devlin', 'who', 'been', 'subject', 'Katherine', 'passive-aggressive', 'hostilities', 'years', 'bit', 'stunt', 'casting', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'ultra-competitive', 'Devlin', 'comically', 'imperious', 'fashion', 'singer/musician', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'arbitrarily', 'thrown', 'mix', 'equally', 'shallow', 'butt-clenching', 'husband.Even', 'comedy', 'consistently', 'funny', 'tightly', 'structured', 'Cactus', 'Flower', 'have', 'admit', 'bit', 'Cary', 'Grant/Irene', 'Dunne-type', 'banter', 'Aniston', 'Sandler', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'when', 'Katherine', 'introduced', 'Palmer', 'Danny', 'confident', 'materialistic', 'wife', 'Devlin', 'are', 'scenes', 'hew', 'closest', 'original', 'movie', 'consequently', 'work', 'best', 'Where', 'when', 'two', 'actors', 'need', 'show', 'are', 'falling', 'love', 'Sandler', 'relative', 'blank', 'slate', 'more', 'serious', 'moments', 'lack', 'credibility', 'characters', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'film', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'role', 'Brooklyn', 'Decker', 'physical', 'requirements', 'Palmer', 'unlikely', 'be', 'up', 'Oscars', 'time', 'next', 'year', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'award', 'year', 'most', 'irritating', 'best', 'buddy', 'Sandler', 'comedy', 'especially', 'when', 'be', 'Katherine', 'lover', 'Austrian', 'sheep', 'buyer', 'Sandler', 'former', 'SNL', 'colleagues', 'Rachel', 'Dratch', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'show', 'up', 'cameos', 'two', 'comically', 'unfortunate', 'victims', 'plastic', 'surgery']",N/A

1371989,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003Y5H524,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Not that I've broken it down in exact mathematics, but I wager that Adam Sandler is batting about .25 in his film career. Meaning that every fourth film he churns out doesn't actually hurt to watch. For every good WATERBOY, THE WEDDING SINGER, and 50 FIRST DATES, there are, four times over, grotesque head scratchers like JACK & JILL, LITTLE NICKY, and YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN. Which brings us to JUST GO WITH IT, which I'm actually going to rate as an above-average romantic comedy, 3 (maybe 3.5) out of 5 stars' worth. JUST GO WITH IT is loosely adapted from the 1969 classic CACTUS FLOWER, and maybe imitation isn't the best form of flattery. This remake isn't quite as good.At least there's the stunning Brooklyn Decker to make googoo eyes at. Sandler plays 40-something Danny Maccabee, a talented plastic surgeon who once had his heart broken and now routinely prowls on them naive hotties. Danny is an average-looking schmoe and so has to rely on his fake wedding ring and made-up bad marriage to gain sympathy and interest from the ladies. It's pretty underhanded, yeah, and it's hard to swallow the gullibility of his marks. It's as if you say, ""Hey, look at the dead birds!"" And these girls look up.When he meets lovely 6th grade math teacher Palmer (Decker) and they spend a night on the beach, the smitten Danny believes she might be the one. But surface now, you complications. Palmer finds the wedding ring in Danny's jeans pocket. A scrambling Danny claims that, yes, he is married but that his divorce is almost final. A doubting Palmer demands to meet the wife. Palmer is the kind of girl that when you say ""Look at the dead bird"" she will look at the ground.Here's Jennifer Aniston who plays Katherine, Danny's loyal, bespectacled nurse assistant and single mother of two, and it's not at all a stretch that Danny would approach her to pose as his estranged wife. Of course, she agrees. Of course, she meets Palmer and inadvertently lets drop that she has two kids. Palmer, who adores kids, now wants to meet the kids. Somehow, this party of pretense relocates to a weekend in Hawaii. Along the way, Danny's cousin Eddie (Nick Swardson) invites himself and passes himself off as Katherine's fianc&eacute; ""Dolph Lundgren."" And this Dolph Lundgren happens to have a Colonel Klink German accent and is into sheep husbandry or something ovine-related, anyway. This, thinks Sandler, is brilliant farce.Honestly, no one but Paul Rudd and John Cusack should be doing this sort of mildly risque romantic comedy. Sandler, Jack Black, and Seth Rogen are on a whole different and subservient level. I don't think JUST GO WITH IT is all that bad, considering. But maybe that's just the inner frat boy talking. There's a sweetness in this film that's trying to get out. The gags aren't nearly gross enough to threaten Apatow's self-esteem. Sandler does tone down his shtick, and that's good. Aniston is engaged and amused, but she isn't given any good lines to work with. But her being there rights the ship some. Brooklyn Decker also isn't given much to do other than be nice and wholesome and naturally sexy, and one wonders how she would've fared had the writers written her a more subversive role. But there are enough laughs. I got a big chuckle out of Rachel Dratch's patient with the roaming eyebrow and Kevin Nealon's guy whose face is BOTOXed to the max. Expect other juvenile sight gags such as mismatched fun bags and huge honking schnozzes and, this being a Sandler vehicle, some potty humor. Nicole Kidman is game as Aniston's competitive sorority rival and Dave Matthews is here acting instead of creating music. Dave Matthews' character supposedly invented the iPod. As you can see, in this movie, lie builds upon lie. It's like the Jenga of deceit.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Cast's Audio Commentary (with Adam Sandler & Nick Swardson and a filmmaker or two)- Director Dennis Dugan's Audio Commentary- 5 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:04:52 minutes)- Blooper Reel (00:04:38 minutes)- ""The Perfect Couple: Jen and Adam"" (00:05:50 minutes)- ""Shooting Hawaii"" (00:05:33 minutes)- ""Dolph- Not the One from ROCKY IV"" (00:06:10 minutes)",4,Not quite as Devlin as I expected,1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,4151,"['Not', ""'ve"", 'broken', 'down', 'exact', 'mathematics', 'wager', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'batting', '.25', 'film', 'career', 'Meaning', 'fourth', 'film', 'out', ""n't"", 'actually', 'hurt', 'watch', 'good', 'WATERBOY', 'THE', 'WEDDING', 'SINGER', '50', 'FIRST', 'DATES', 'are', 'four', 'times', 'grotesque', 'head', 'scratchers', 'JACK', 'JILL', 'LITTLE', 'NICKY', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'MESS', 'WITH', 'THE', 'ZOHAN', 'Which', 'JUST', 'GO', 'WITH', 'IT', ""'m"", 'actually', 'going', 'rate', 'above-average', 'romantic', 'comedy', '3', 'maybe', '3.5', '5', 'stars', 'worth', 'JUST', 'GO', 'WITH', 'IT', 'loosely', 'adapted', '1969', 'classic', 'CACTUS', 'FLOWER', 'maybe', 'imitation', ""n't"", 'best', 'form', 'flattery', 'remake', ""n't"", 'quite', 'good.At', 'stunning', 'Brooklyn', 'Decker', 'make', 'googoo', 'eyes', 'Sandler', '40-something', 'Danny', 'Maccabee', 'talented', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'who', 'once', 'had', 'heart', 'broken', 'now', 'routinely', 'prowls', 'naive', 'hotties', 'Danny', 'average-looking', 'schmoe', 'so', 'rely', 'fake', 'wedding', 'ring', 'made-up', 'bad', 'marriage', 'gain', 'sympathy', 'interest', 'ladies', 'pretty', 'underhanded', 'yeah', 'hard', 'swallow', 'gullibility', 'marks', 'say', 'Hey', 'look', 'dead', 'birds', 'girls', 'look', 'lovely', '6th', 'grade', 'math', 'teacher', 'Palmer', 'Decker', 'spend', 'night', 'beach', 'smitten', 'Danny', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'surface', 'now', 'complications', 'Palmer', 'wedding', 'ring', 'Danny', 'jeans', 'pocket', 'scrambling', 'Danny', 'claims', 'yes', 'married', 'divorce', 'almost', 'final', 'doubting', 'Palmer', 'demands', 'meet', 'wife', 'Palmer', 'kind', 'girl', 'when', 'say', 'Look', 'dead', 'bird', 'will', 'look', 'ground.Here', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'who', 'Katherine', 'Danny', 'loyal', 'bespectacled', 'nurse', 'assistant', 'single', 'mother', 'two', 'not', 'stretch', 'Danny', 'would', 'approach', 'pose', 'estranged', 'wife', 'course', 'course', 'Palmer', 'inadvertently', 'drop', 'two', 'kids', 'Palmer', 'who', 'kids', 'now', 'meet', 'kids', 'Somehow', 'party', 'pretense', 'relocates', 'weekend', 'Hawaii', 'way', 'Danny', 'cousin', 'Eddie', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'off', 'Katherine', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'have', 'Colonel', 'Klink', 'German', 'accent', 'sheep', 'husbandry', 'something', 'ovine-related', 'anyway', 'Sandler', 'brilliant', 'farce.Honestly', 'one', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'John', 'Cusack', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'sort', 'mildly', 'risque', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Sandler', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'are', 'whole', 'different', 'subservient', 'level', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'JUST', 'GO', 'WITH', 'IT', 'bad', 'considering', 'maybe', 'just', 'inner', 'frat', 'boy', 'talking', 'sweetness', 'film', 'trying', 'get', 'out', 'gags', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'gross', 'enough', 'threaten', 'Apatow', 'self-esteem', 'Sandler', 'tone', 'down', 'shtick', 'good', 'Aniston', 'engaged', 'amused', ""n't"", 'given', 'good', 'lines', 'work', 'being', 'rights', 'ship', 'Brooklyn', 'Decker', 'also', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'do', 'other', 'be', 'nice', 'wholesome', 'naturally', 'sexy', 'one', 'how', 'would', ""'ve"", 'fared', 'had', 'writers', 'written', 'more', 'subversive', 'role', 'are', 'enough', 'laughs', 'got', 'big', 'chuckle', 'Rachel', 'Dratch', 'patient', 'roaming', 'eyebrow', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'guy', 'face', 'BOTOXed', 'max', 'Expect', 'other', 'juvenile', 'sight', 'gags', 'such', 'mismatched', 'fun', 'bags', 'huge', 'honking', 'schnozzes', 'being', 'Sandler', 'vehicle', 'potty', 'humor', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'game', 'Aniston', 'competitive', 'sorority', 'rival', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'here', 'acting', 'instead', 'creating', 'music', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'character', 'supposedly', 'invented', 'iPod', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'lie', 'builds', 'lie', 'Jenga', 'deceit.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Cast', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'filmmaker', 'two', 'Director', 'Dennis', 'Dugan', 'Audio', 'Commentary-', '5', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'totaling', '00:04:52', 'minutes', 'Blooper', 'Reel', '00:04:38', 'minutes', 'Perfect', 'Couple', 'Jen', 'Adam', '00:05:50', 'minutes', 'Shooting', 'Hawaii', '00:05:33', 'minutes', 'Dolph-', 'Not', 'One', 'ROCKY', 'IV', '00:06:10', 'minutes']",N/A

1372024,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B003Y5H524,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[0, 1]","This film reminded me how funny both Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler can be - neither has been in a film lately that really showcased that. Aniston really is a brilliant comedic actress, I think that gets lost sometimes in discussions of her. Her timing and facial expressions are excellent, and in the first half of this film especially, I thought she put that to good use and was very funny (and lifted Sandler up too - his humor is not usually my style.)The basic plot (as has already been described in other reviews) is that she has worked as the long-time office manager to Adam Sandler's plastic surgeon, and knows him better than anyone else. He's a player who wears a wedding ring to bars and tells girls sad stories of his mean (fake) wife to seduce them. A stupid plot yes, but that's true of most rom-coms, so personally I forgave it. The twist comes when he meets a girl he actually thinks he wants to be with long-term, and has to somehow work through his lie. He asks Aniston to play his soon-to-be ex-wife, and from there all sorts of ridiculous chaos and misunderstandings ensue.Aniston and Sandler are the heart of the film, and as I said, I think they are great together in the first half, when they are playing off each other to pull off this duplicity. As the film turns more romantic, their chemistry isn't quite as strong, but there are still some great moments. Nicole Kidman and Dave Matthews (not sure how that came about) cameo, and have some funny moments also. There's plenty of jokes that fall flat, and the plot is of course absurd, but overall, this gave me 4-stars worth of laughs.",4,Aniston/Sandler Comic Chemistry Made This a Solid 4-Star For Me,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,1615,"['film', 'reminded', 'how', 'funny', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'can', 'be', 'been', 'film', 'lately', 'really', 'showcased', 'Aniston', 'really', 'brilliant', 'comedic', 'actress', 'think', 'lost', 'sometimes', 'discussions', 'timing', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'excellent', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'especially', 'thought', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'lifted', 'Sandler', 'up', 'too', 'humor', 'not', 'usually', 'style', 'basic', 'plot', 'already', 'been', 'described', 'other', 'reviews', 'worked', 'long-time', 'office', 'manager', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'player', 'who', 'wedding', 'ring', 'bars', 'tells', 'girls', 'sad', 'stories', 'mean', 'fake', 'wife', 'seduce', 'stupid', 'plot', 'yes', 'true', 'most', 'rom-coms', 'personally', 'forgave', 'twist', 'when', 'girl', 'actually', 'be', 'long-term', 'somehow', 'work', 'lie', 'Aniston', 'play', 'soon-to-be', 'ex-wife', 'sorts', 'ridiculous', 'chaos', 'misunderstandings', 'ensue.Aniston', 'Sandler', 'are', 'heart', 'film', 'said', 'think', 'are', 'great', 'together', 'first', 'half', 'when', 'are', 'playing', 'off', 'other', 'pull', 'off', 'duplicity', 'film', 'more', 'romantic', 'chemistry', ""n't"", 'quite', 'strong', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'moments', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'cameo', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'also', 'plenty', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'plot', 'course', 'absurd', 'overall', 'gave', '4-stars', 'worth', 'laughs']",N/A

Years later he's a plastic surgeon and he runs into a blonde bombshell, Brooklyn Decker,  who he determines is his destiny but she catches him with a ring so he fabricates a story that he's divorcing his wife and needs his secretary, Jennifer Aniston, to play the image with her children.What happens is more and more complications with some good humor and some off humor. The highlights of this tale are fairly well developed characters, especially for a romantic comedy. Brooklyn Decker's character is far from an airhead and has legitimate reasons for wanting to meet the ex wife before she gets serious with the Sandler character. The Hawaiian face off between Aniston and her sorority arch rival, played by Nicole Kidman, is one of the best scenes. But the best supporting character is played by the daughter of Aniston, a wanna be actress who does a low end British accent and has some of the best lines. The ending is predictable but pretty much what the audience wants so we're to blame for it. Dave Matthews has a small role as the make believe guy who invented the IPod.

I had yet to see an Adam Sandler movie that was even tolerable, but, not quite able to fully shake my misgivings, I rented it anyway. And I was glad I did -- this was a good film.Now, as can be expected of a Sandler film, there is a lot of bathroom humor, crude sexual humor, and stupidity. However, unlike most Sandler films, those instances do not outweigh the actually amusing, well done, and interesting moments. Surprise, right?The story follows an ugly kid who is engaged to (he thinks) the love of his life; at the last moment, he hears her voicing her true opinion of him (it's not flattering). So, the engagement is off; and off to a bar he heads to drown his sorrows and mope over his ring. Until the image of a lonely married guy draws the attention of a pretty woman. This sets Sandler on a new path in life -- chasing girls while selling all manner of sob stories.Everything is going well, until he meets someone who is more than just a pretty face and a new conquest...and she finds the fake ring he uses to sell his married life sob stories. This sets him on a roller coaster ride in which he ropes his assistant (Anniston) into playing his soon-to-be-ex wife -- and then her kids, as his kids.Of course, everything falls apart when he and Anniston start developing feelings for each other -- or, rather, recognizing their feelings for one another.Predictable? Yes. Improbable? Absolutely. Funny? Heck yeah. There are enough amusing characters, funny scenarios, and ridiculous antics to make this an interesting, fun film...and to outweigh the less than stellar, typical Sandler moments.If you like typical Sandler films, you might not care for this one; otherwise, you might get a kick out of ""Just Go With It"".All in all, I'd give this a 4/5...perhaps more generous than it deserves, but it's such a rare treat to find a decent Sandler movie, why not?",4,Adam Sandler can be funny?!

But out of all that, he does have one thing to be happy about, his February hit, Just Go With It.Sandler, Brooklyn Decker, and Jennifer Aniston, deliver stellar performances in this classic Hawaii set comedy. Dave Mathews and Razzie nominated Nicole Kidman,(nominated for her performance as Devlin, in this movie,) are the very funny snobbish couple, along with Bucky Larson star Nick Swardson who is also quite hilarious in this movie as Sandler's cousin. But the two surprising performances come from Bailee Madison and Griffen Cluck, who play Aniston's funny children. Adam Sandler plays Danny Maccabee, a successful plastic surgeon that carries around a wedding ring as his pitch for a one night stand every Friday, until one night he meets, ""The One,"" played by Brooklyn Decker,but of course his ring comes and bites him in the butt. Adam Sandler seeks advice from his personal secretary, Katherin(Aniston.)

I think this is a good movie and surprisingly Aniston and Sandler have chemistry- think mature chemistry. One of the funniest characters in this is Katherine's kid Michael (Griffin Gluck). Griffin Gluck had some laugh-out-loud lines which he delivered masterfully and comically. He's definitely a kid to watch.PLOT: This film is loosely based on the 1969 movie Cactus Flower. It's a silly romantic comedy. Sandler who plays Danny Maccabee is a successful plastic surgeon in Los Angeles who feigns an unhappy marriage to get women, after having been heartbroken on his wedding day 20 years ago. The only woman aware of this is his office manager Katherine Murphy (Jennifer Aniston), a divorced mother of two. At a party, Danny meets Palmer (Brooklyn Decker), a sixth grade math teacher, without his wedding ring on, and they have a romantic night together. The next morning, she ends up finding the ring in his pocket and she assumes he was hiding the fact he was married. She refuses to date him because her parents divorced because of  adultery.Danny goes to Palmer's school to try to get Palmer back. Instead of telling her the truth, he tells her that he is getting divorced from a woman named Devlin, named after Devlin Adams, whom his office manager, Katherine had mentioned was an old college sorority nememis.  Palmer then wants to meet Devlin, and Danny agrees. Danny asks Katherine to pose as his soon to be ex-wife for him, and they go shopping on Rodeo Drive to buy her clothes so she can look like a trophy wife. At a hotel having drinks, Danny and Palmer are greeted by a made-over Katherine, who gives them her blessing. However, after hearing Katherine talking on the phone with her kids, Palmer assumes that her kids are Danny's as well, which Danny goes along with. Danny then privately meets with Katherine's kids, Maggie (Bailee Madison) and Michael (Griffin Gluck), to get them to play along. Initially Katherine is furious, but she reluctantly agrees.From there, they the lies get bigger and more over the top... and as you can imagine.

I smiled through much of the movie.2. Sandler was great, Jennifer Aniston was great. Not only are they funny, but they can really act. The entire cast was really good. Sandler's goofy friend sidekick was hilarious, the children were dynamic and funny. Kevin Nealon had an absolutely hilariuos bit. Nicole Kidman was perfect as Jennifer's competitive and not so nice friend.3. The plot was very different and interesting.

Danny (Sandler) has a unique way to meet women, he uses a wedding ring.  After a gorgous woman named Palmer finds out his trick she threatens to leave unless Danny introduces her to his evil soon-to-be ex-wife.  After getting Katherine (Aniston) to go along with it they all end up in Hawaii where things get complicated.  After movies like ""Bedtime Stories"" and ""Click"" it seemed like Sandler was starting to move away from what makes him funny. ""Grown-ups"" was good, but that seemed more like friends having fun then a movie.  This movie is closer to the humor in ""Big Daddy"" then any other movie he has done recently.  While still a pretty soft PG13 Sandler, this movie is actually very, very funny.  Nowhere near the days of ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Billy Madison"", Sandler is slowly trying to capture his younger days, and with this and ""Grown-ups"" he is getting close.  The chemistry between Sandler and Aniston is perfect and I would not be surprised to see them in more movies together.  Very, very entertaining and funny.  A good laid back comedy that holds the funny all the way through, unlike movies like ""The Dilemma"" which is funny, but turns serious at the end.  Overall a very funny movie that will not dissapoint. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - Yes, I sure would.*Also try - Grown-ups & Big Daddy",4,"A really, really funny movie.
