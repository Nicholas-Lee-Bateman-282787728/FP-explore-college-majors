1078281,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B000QXDG7U,Lesley Aeschliman,"[5, 5]","The Inuyasha Complete Deluxe Movie Box Set includes all four of the Inuyasha movies: Affections Touching Across Time, The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass, Swords of an Honorable Ruler, and Fire on the Mystic Island, as well as the soundtrack CDs that accompanied the release of all four of these films in Japan.The outer box of the set is wooden and has a small slipcover to put over the box.  When you open the wooden box, there is a cardboard box inside.  This cardboard box has an outer cardboard sleeve to protect it.  When you remove the cardboard sleeve, it reveals that the cardboard box has four double-sided and one single-sided plastic tray inside to hold the DVDs and the CDs.  The front of the first double-sided tray has a CD-shaped piece of cardboard on it, which has the name of the set on it and plays up the contents inside the set.The box set also comes with two booklets.  The first booklet has the promotional picture for each of the films, as well as lists the chapters for each of the movie DVDs.  The second booklet is fourteen pages long, and is about the music from the Inuyasha movies.  The first few pages of the booklet contain the tracklistings for each of the soundtrack CDs included in the box set.  Then, it goes into four pages of pictures and explanations of the various instruments used for recording the music for the films.  The final two pages of the booklet lists the music staff and the CD staff for each of the movies.Overall, the Inuyasha Complete Movie Box Set is an economical way to acquire all four of the Inuyasha feature films.  It's also the only way to acquire the soundtrack CDs in America without having to import them from Japan.  At retail outlets, I have seen this set sell for anywhere between $30 and $80.  If you were to buy each of the films individually, it would cost you anywhere between $15 to $20 to acquire each one.  And if you also want the soundtracks, you would have to factor in the cost of importing them from Japan.  Once you do the math, you realize that this box set is a great deal if you're interested in owning all four Inuyasha films and their accompanying soundtrack CDs.  It's a release I would recommend to anyone who likes the Inuyasha series and enjoys the films.I wrote this review after watching and listening to a copy of this box set that my husband and I purchased.",5,An economical way to get all the Inuyasha films and soundtracks,1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,2353,"['Inuyasha', 'Complete', 'Deluxe', 'Movie', 'Box', 'Set', 'four', 'Inuyasha', 'movies', 'Affections', 'Touching', 'Time', 'Castle', 'Beyond', 'Looking', 'Glass', 'Swords', 'Honorable', 'Ruler', 'Fire', 'Mystic', 'Island', 'as', 'well', 'soundtrack', 'CDs', 'accompanied', 'release', 'four', 'films', 'Japan.The', 'outer', 'box', 'set', 'wooden', 'small', 'slipcover', 'put', 'over', 'box', 'When', 'open', 'wooden', 'box', 'cardboard', 'box', 'inside', 'cardboard', 'box', 'outer', 'cardboard', 'sleeve', 'protect', 'When', 'remove', 'cardboard', 'sleeve', 'cardboard', 'box', 'four', 'double-sided', 'one', 'single-sided', 'plastic', 'tray', 'hold', 'DVDs', 'CDs', 'front', 'first', 'double-sided', 'tray', 'CD-shaped', 'piece', 'cardboard', 'name', 'set', 'up', 'contents', 'set.The', 'box', 'set', 'also', 'two', 'booklets', 'first', 'booklet', 'promotional', 'picture', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'lists', 'chapters', 'movie', 'DVDs', 'second', 'booklet', 'fourteen', 'pages', 'long', 'music', 'Inuyasha', 'movies', 'first', 'few', 'pages', 'booklet', 'contain', 'tracklistings', 'soundtrack', 'CDs', 'included', 'box', 'set', 'Then', 'four', 'pages', 'pictures', 'explanations', 'various', 'instruments', 'used', 'recording', 'music', 'films', 'final', 'two', 'pages', 'booklet', 'music', 'staff', 'CD', 'staff', 'movies.Overall', 'Inuyasha', 'Complete', 'Movie', 'Box', 'Set', 'economical', 'way', 'acquire', 'four', 'Inuyasha', 'feature', 'films', 'also', 'only', 'way', 'acquire', 'soundtrack', 'CDs', 'America', 'having', 'import', 'Japan', 'retail', 'outlets', 'have', 'seen', 'set', 'sell', 'anywhere', '30', '80', 'were', 'buy', 'films', 'individually', 'would', 'cost', 'anywhere', '15', '20', 'acquire', 'one', 'also', 'want', 'soundtracks', 'would', 'have', 'factor', 'cost', 'importing', 'Japan', 'Once', 'do', 'math', 'realize', 'box', 'set', 'great', 'deal', ""'re"", 'interested', 'owning', 'four', 'Inuyasha', 'films', 'accompanying', 'soundtrack', 'CDs', 'release', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'Inuyasha', 'series', 'films.I', 'wrote', 'review', 'watching', 'listening', 'copy', 'box', 'set', 'husband', 'purchased']",N/A
