I have been a fan of Trejo's forever, and it is not well known, that he is a drug counselor, and has been since before the movie business got to him.  When you hear him talk about his Uncle Gilbert, and all the violence and drugs he grew up around, then give that signature crooked smile, and laugh, it is hard to imagine anyone being able to do so. This is really a Great story, told by him, and has a few guest stars.  Probably something High School students should see, and try to learn from.

Many of us have seen Danny in films like Michael Mann's Heat, and Robert Rodriquez movies like Desperado and From Dusk till dawn, but few of us know the incredible story of Danny's life growing up in Los Angeles, using drugs like Heroin, being a gang member, and commiting robberies. The events of his younger years landed him in prison. And there Danny grew even tougher and more violent until he ended up in solitary confinement. There he reflected on the tragedy of his life and the bad choices he made. From that time on Danny decided to go straight and change his life. Danny Trejo himself tells the incredible story of how he turned from being a criminal to helping others and inspiring them. So much so that helping others is his greatest passion, while acting is a lesser passion. Interviews with friends Steve Buscemi, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Eddie Bunker, Robert Rodriquez and others, reflect on their memories and experiences with this extraordinary individual. I have always liked Trejo as an actor, but this documentary reveils there is far more to this man than just a simple actor.

1086644,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B000SL3VM0,stoic,"[2, 4]","Champion is an interesting documentary detailing Danny Trejo's life story. Trejo was born into a tough Los Angeles neighborhood. He tried marijuana when he was eight and shot heroin for the first time at twelve. Eventually, he landed in San Quentin prison.The remarkable part of his story came afterward. Trejo became a drug counselor and helped kids avoid the mistakes that he had made. Then, a series of lucky breaks led Trejo into films, where he makes a nice living as a character actor. In Champion he shares some of his philosophy about life. Trejo is a very likeable person.I like Champion, but it wanders off course at times. The film comes uncomfortably close to glorifying violence. Champion is supposed to be about redemption from violence but - let's face it - vice is more interesting than virtue. The filmmakers just couldn't resist including Trejo's great, bloody stories.Bizarrely, Trejo often appears with his shirt open so that the camera can lovingly zoom on his ""tats."" I had the feeling that someone should ask, ""Why don't you button your shirt?"" Instead, everyone pretends it's normal for a 60-ish man to conduct interviews with his belly hanging out.The film also includes interviews with celebrities such as Dennis Hopper and Val Kilmer. The film would have been better without these boring clips.I recommend Champion, but I do think that the film has a few flaws.",3,In violence we forget who we are. - Mary McCarthy,1272585600,"04 30, 2010",2010,1388,"['Champion', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'detailing', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'life', 'story', 'Trejo', 'was', 'born', 'tough', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'neighborhood', 'tried', 'marijuana', 'when', 'was', 'eight', 'shot', 'heroin', 'first', 'time', 'twelve', 'Eventually', 'landed', 'San', 'Quentin', 'prison.The', 'remarkable', 'part', 'story', 'came', 'afterward', 'Trejo', 'became', 'drug', 'counselor', 'helped', 'kids', 'avoid', 'mistakes', 'had', 'made', 'Then', 'series', 'lucky', 'breaks', 'led', 'Trejo', 'films', 'where', 'nice', 'living', 'character', 'actor', 'Champion', 'shares', 'philosophy', 'life', 'Trejo', 'very', 'likeable', 'person.I', 'Champion', 'course', 'times', 'film', 'uncomfortably', 'close', 'glorifying', 'violence', 'Champion', 'supposed', 'be', 'redemption', 'violence', 'let', 'face', 'vice', 'more', 'interesting', 'virtue', 'filmmakers', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'including', 'Trejo', 'great', 'bloody', 'stories.Bizarrely', 'Trejo', 'often', 'shirt', 'open', 'so', 'camera', 'can', 'lovingly', 'zoom', 'tats', 'had', 'feeling', 'someone', 'should', 'ask', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'button', 'shirt', 'Instead', 'everyone', 'normal', '60-ish', 'man', 'conduct', 'interviews', 'belly', 'hanging', 'out.The', 'film', 'also', 'interviews', 'celebrities', 'such', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'boring', 'clips.I', 'recommend', 'Champion', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'few', 'flaws']",N/A

1086646,AXYK35P5RCPJ2,B000SL3VM0,Trejofan,"[0, 0]","Actually I didn't expect this movie to be what it was.  I expected it to be life-story re-enactments, with Mr. Majestic  (oops, I mean Mr. Trejo--sorry but he reminds me a bit of tough guy Charles Bronson) only coming in at the end when he would re-enact his boxing championships in the prisons where they took place. That was not at all what it turned out to be.Instead it was a very long filmed interview with Mr. Trejo as he walked through locations from his past including San Quentin. I sat practically mesmerized, literally unable to breathe while watching this movie--which was quite impressive considering I had to watch it on a 4 INCH square screen.  Very few movies affect me that way or hold my attention so raptly.  You'd think that would be boring, but it was fascinating and hypnotizing--even though a hypnotist once told me that I can not be hypnotized because I am too strong minded.(He said that like that was a BAD thing!!!) Mr Trejo was very candid about what he'd done and his addictions and the time he spent in prisons and reformatories and juvenile detention centers.What was very impressive to me was that he never blamed anyone like his parents or his partner in crime uncle who was his &#34;example&#34; albeit a bad one.  He only blamed himself for the trials (including court ones) and tribulations that he suffered in his young and troubled years.  Instead, he accepted responsibility for what he did, paid the price, and even expressed remorse for those he hurt. What we must remember however, is that Mr. Trejo is a product of his whole life, not just the GOOD parts.  It is clear that he paid dearly for his mistakes, and now continues to pay back.  Fortunately for the rest of us who share the world with him, he is now a shining example of good and giving. No one has a bad thing to say about this man and he speaks no ill of anyone.What touched my heart deeply was his reaction to the memories spawned by the locations from his past. It made me cry.  The filming of this interview really took a toll on Mr. Trejo.  You could see his feelings surfacing through his ultra tough-guy visage many times. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Trejo would be a force to be dealt with if he chose that path. Even though I have never broken a law in my life, or taken illegal drugs or even gotten drunk (yes I am a pretty boring individual), this movie brought me to tears. This truly is a movie that everyone, including those with drug and alcohol problems and also ex-cons should watch.  Mr. Trejo's face tells his story.If I ever got the chance to meet this man, I would consider it an honor, Plus, I can't think of another nearly 70 year old man that I would like to see with out a shirt from time to time.
