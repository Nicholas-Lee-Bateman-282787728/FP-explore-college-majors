His best friend John is contstantly trying to help him to fit in and get over his feelings of awkwardness.  One Sunday morning, while the two are at a restaurant, a rhinoceros rampages through the streets.  Soon, Stanley notices more and more rhinoceroses and begins to realize that everyone in town is turning into them.  Determined not to change, he confronts John with the problem only to watch his transformation in a rhino.  As the rest of the world changes, including Daisy, the woman of his dreams, Stanley desparately tries to transform, but realizes that he can't and that he won't.This is a good adaptation of the absurdist play by Eugene Ionesco and changes the setting from a small French town to a big US city.  Wonderful performances by Gene Wilder as Stanley and Karen Black as Daisy; and a standout performance from Zero Mostel as Stanley's friend John.  Tom O'Horgan's direction is definitley unique, making it feel as though the viewer is watching a stage play.  The only drawback is the bad '70s music that doesn't fit.The DVD has some great extras including an interview with Tom O'Horgan, an interview with Zero Mostel, information about Eugene Ionesco, and the original movie trailer, to name a few.  The trailer gives an idea of how the studio marketed this film as a comedy, even though it views more along the lines of a drama or a very, very dark comedy.Having read the play in college, I enjoyed this adaptation.

742726,AZ3I29TM4UMJ4,B00008HCAB,G. Tavaglione,"[3, 3]","I enjoyed the movie (DVD) immensely, but I disagree with some of the other reviewers about the movie in that it is 'hopelessly' stuck in 1973 (the year I graduated high school). The music, the costumes, and the bad 1970s hairstyles detract considerably from what was supposed to be a universal theme. I suppose if it could be remade today, in 2052 someone will be saying it was stuck in 2012.What this movie should forever be preserved for is the tour-de-force performance of Zero Mostel and the frozen-in-time performance of his transformation into a rhinoceros - which won him a Tony Award in the stage version and can never be successfully repeated or copied by anyone. Thank you film producers for capturing it on film for all of us to enjoy over and over again many years later.Gene Wilder is amazing - one for co-starring against Zero twice in his lifetime, but also for the 'spin' on his characterization of the 'lone man' who watches everyone around him turn into a rhinoceros. He could have been boring, but isn't.I hate to say it, but Karen Black was about as interesting as the lettuce Zero was eating. Even in this 'movie of the absurd' her performance is strained. Her head is always 'down' and you see nothing but forehead and the whites of her eyes.

742727,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00008HCAB,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[25, 29]","One of the great things about this DVD is that it includes an interview, taped in 2002, with the film's director, Tom O'Horgan. (He was the guy responsible, along with Galt McDermot, for the original Hair on Broadway).  Among other things, O'Horgan talks about the conversion of the original Eugene Ionesco play into a cnematic version, giving great credit to the screenwriter, Julian Barry.And with good reason.  While Ionesco is one of the great absurdist playwrights, his sensibility is decidedly European.  This means that the sense of humor expressed in the original play would very likely fall on deaf (American) ears, to a large extent.  What the screenwriter has done is to essentially Americanize the dialogue, making it truly hilarious in many scenes.And of course it helps to have a great cast.  The two leads, Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, are perfect for their roles, especially Mostel who is funny enough to make you micturate in your trousers, if you catch my drift.  Seen first as a man overly concerned with appearance and manners, he descends, in the course of the film, to the level of the titular creature.The story is of a small town which is beset by a bizarre plague, if one can call it that--the transforming of humans into rhinos. Ionesco was commenting on the radical changes occurring in society as the Cold War became a reality--meaning, more than anything else, as people had much more to be afraid of than they did before.  Fear makes us lose our rationality, become less human.  Even become rhinoceri.This is a really funny film that is just as good now--maybe even better--than it was when originally released in 1974.  In supporting roles, Percy Rodriquez and Joe Silver are especially good--staunch representatives of corporate America.  Karen Black does a great job as a sexy woman who Stanley (Gene Wilder) works with and is smitten with and eventually anguishes over as he is the sole remaining human in a town full of rhinos.Much, much better than you might think.  Definitely recommended.",4,Hilariious Americanized Ionesco,1063411200,"09 13, 2003",2003,2026,"['One', 'great', 'things', 'DVD', 'interview', 'taped', '2002', 'film', 'director', 'Tom', ""O'Horgan"", 'was', 'guy', 'responsible', 'Galt', 'McDermot', 'original', 'Hair', 'Broadway', 'other', 'things', ""O'Horgan"", 'conversion', 'original', 'Eugene', 'Ionesco', 'play', 'cnematic', 'version', 'giving', 'great', 'credit', 'screenwriter', 'Julian', 'Barry.And', 'good', 'reason', 'Ionesco', 'one', 'great', 'absurdist', 'playwrights', 'sensibility', 'decidedly', 'European', 'sense', 'humor', 'expressed', 'original', 'play', 'would', 'very', 'likely', 'fall', 'deaf', 'American', 'large', 'extent', 'What', 'screenwriter', 'done', 'essentially', 'Americanize', 'dialogue', 'making', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'many', 'scenes.And', 'course', 'have', 'great', 'cast', 'two', 'leads', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'especially', 'Mostel', 'who', 'funny', 'enough', 'make', 'micturate', 'trousers', 'catch', 'drift', 'Seen', 'first', 'man', 'overly', 'concerned', 'appearance', 'manners', 'course', 'film', 'level', 'titular', 'creature.The', 'story', 'small', 'town', 'beset', 'bizarre', 'plague', 'one', 'can', 'call', 'transforming', 'humans', 'rhinos', 'Ionesco', 'was', 'commenting', 'radical', 'changes', 'occurring', 'society', 'Cold', 'War', 'became', 'reality', 'meaning', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'people', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'be', 'afraid', 'did', 'Fear', 'lose', 'rationality', 'become', 'less', 'human', 'Even', 'become', 'rhinoceri.This', 'really', 'funny', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'now', 'maybe', 'even', 'better', 'was', 'when', 'originally', 'released', '1974', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Percy', 'Rodriquez', 'Joe', 'Silver', 'are', 'especially', 'good', 'staunch', 'representatives', 'corporate', 'America', 'Karen', 'Black', 'great', 'job', 'sexy', 'woman', 'who', 'Stanley', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'smitten', 'eventually', 'anguishes', 'sole', 'remaining', 'human', 'town', 'full', 'rhinos.Much', 'much', 'better', 'might', 'think', 'Definitely', 'recommended']",Rhinoceros
742728,A2NT3FUNOPX8HP,B00008HCAB,RSMM,"[11, 16]","One would think that the combination of Eugene Ionesco, Zero Mostel, and Gene Wilder would be a guaranteed success. Sadly, such is not the case with the American Film Theatre production of ""Rhinoceros"" as committed to film in 1974. While the theme of maintaining one's identity as everyone else goes along with the herd (originally a metaphor for Nazism, McCarthyism, etc.) is intact, Ionesco's text has been so altered that is is destroyed. Here it becomes subject to slapstick, poor unfunny added situations, exaggerated performances, and clumsy direction. The film has been criticized for ""staginess,"" but that is not the real problem. It makes use of camera movement, external sets, etc.; it just has no rhythm. It is a trial to get through it--certainly not the case with Ionesco's original, either on stage or as read to one's self. Gene Wilder is always diverting but the character he portrays has been so tampered with that it's just unpleasant and tedious. Karen Black's character is an embarrassment as are all the other minor characters. The only bright spot in this mess is Zero Mostel, whose fifteen minutes on screen are amazing, his transformation from a dandified fussbudget into a destructive rhinoceros an acting tour-de-force; done without makeup, it encapsulates the essence of the piece. But that's it: the other ninety minutes are dreary and awful.The DVD is very well transferred, but the extras are disappointing: e.g., an ""interview"" with Zero Mostel is simply text to be read frame by frame, and an article about Ionesco and the play is simply an on-screen text repetition of the liner notes. There is a very long interview with the director, in murky sound; after seeing his incompetence demonstrated in this film, no one will have any desire to see him drone on about it.",2,Disappointing,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,1799,"['One', 'would', 'think', 'combination', 'Eugene', 'Ionesco', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'would', 'be', 'guaranteed', 'success', 'Sadly', 'such', 'not', 'case', 'American', 'Film', 'Theatre', 'production', 'Rhinoceros', 'committed', 'film', '1974', 'theme', 'maintaining', 'one', 'identity', 'everyone', 'else', 'herd', 'originally', 'metaphor', 'Nazism', 'McCarthyism', 'etc', 'intact', 'Ionesco', 'text', 'been', 'so', 'altered', 'destroyed', 'Here', 'subject', 'slapstick', 'poor', 'unfunny', 'added', 'situations', 'exaggerated', 'performances', 'clumsy', 'direction', 'film', 'been', 'criticized', 'staginess', 'not', 'real', 'problem', 'use', 'camera', 'movement', 'external', 'sets', 'etc', 'just', 'rhythm', 'trial', 'get', 'certainly', 'not', 'case', 'Ionesco', 'original', 'either', 'stage', 'read', 'one', 'self', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'always', 'diverting', 'character', 'been', 'so', 'tampered', 'just', 'unpleasant', 'tedious', 'Karen', 'Black', 'character', 'embarrassment', 'are', 'other', 'minor', 'characters', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'mess', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'screen', 'are', 'amazing', 'transformation', 'dandified', 'fussbudget', 'destructive', 'rhinoceros', 'acting', 'tour-de-force', 'done', 'makeup', 'essence', 'piece', 'other', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'are', 'dreary', 'awful.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'well', 'transferred', 'extras', 'are', 'disappointing', 'e.g.', 'interview', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'simply', 'text', 'be', 'read', 'frame', 'frame', 'article', 'Ionesco', 'play', 'simply', 'on-screen', 'text', 'repetition', 'liner', 'notes', 'very', 'long', 'interview', 'director', 'murky', 'sound', 'seeing', 'incompetence', 'demonstrated', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'desire', 'see', 'drone']",Rhinoceros
