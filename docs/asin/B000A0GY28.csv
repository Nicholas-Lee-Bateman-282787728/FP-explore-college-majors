This is an eye opening view into how they diagnose and treat every disease or deficiency known to humankind.This film shows how Tibetan medicine works (in a nutshell), from diagnosing through a patients pulse to the medicine made by the good doctor himself.  The knowledge that exhibited about the body and its interactions with the herbs, plants and minerals that he turns into medicine is astounding.This is a documentary and are alot of subtitles, and the english that is spoken sometimes is hard to understand, however a glimpse into this world is well worth the purchase. The information alone will make you want to seek out a Tibetan physician.
