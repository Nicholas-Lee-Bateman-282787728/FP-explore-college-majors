907905,A1PCQA29APBXFM,B0009KQPAK,Adorem,"[40, 44]","The oft-filmed Frances Hodgson Burnett novel The Secret Garden was restaged for BBC television in 1975 Sarah Hollis Andrews stars as the insufferable brat who is yanked from her home in India and sent to live with her emotionless uncle. She is humbled by her equally headstrong crippled cousin, and humanized by the gardener's son, who entreats her into his special fantasy world. As Andrews is taught the values of humility and generosity by ""the secret garden,"" she simultaneously warms her uncle's cold heart. Not quite as elaborate as the famous 1949 MGM version, nor as accomplished as the 1993 Agnezia Holland-directed remake, this 1975 Secret Garden nonetheless has a charm of its own.This was first  shown here in the USA on PBS in 1976 on the PBS series  ONCE UPON A CLASSIC that was hosted by Bill Bixby.  I remember watching SECRET GARDEN for the 7 weeks it was shown on this series.Watching  this  on DVD brought  tears to my  eyes because its such  a wonderful  version  and, it  brings me back  29 years ago when I first  saw this.",5,THE BEST VERSION OF ALL!!,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,1045,"['oft-filmed', 'Frances', 'Hodgson', 'Burnett', 'novel', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'was', 'restaged', 'BBC', 'television', '1975', 'Sarah', 'Hollis', 'Andrews', 'insufferable', 'brat', 'who', 'yanked', 'home', 'India', 'sent', 'live', 'emotionless', 'uncle', 'humbled', 'equally', 'headstrong', 'crippled', 'cousin', 'humanized', 'gardener', 'son', 'who', 'special', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Andrews', 'taught', 'values', 'humility', 'generosity', 'secret', 'garden', 'simultaneously', 'uncle', 'cold', 'heart', 'Not', 'quite', 'as', 'elaborate', 'famous', '1949', 'MGM', 'version', 'as', 'accomplished', '1993', 'Agnezia', 'Holland-directed', 'remake', '1975', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'nonetheless', 'charm', 'own.This', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'here', 'USA', 'PBS', '1976', 'PBS', 'series', 'ONCE', 'A', 'CLASSIC', 'was', 'hosted', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'remember', 'watching', 'SECRET', 'GARDEN', '7', 'weeks', 'was', 'shown', 'series.Watching', 'DVD', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'such', 'wonderful', 'version', 'back', '29', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'saw']",The Secret Garden

There's not much technology in this BBC TV version, but it is a very close adaptation of the story.  The acting, although a little stilted at the beginning, gets better later on, and the actors have very realistic accents for the time and place.  The outdoor scenes look quite authentic even though they were filmed in Scotland instead of England, where the story is set.  I liked the appearance of the English robin throughout the program.  It's quite different from our American bird, and it gave the original story a ""garden"" atmosphere.  Some of garden scenes looked a bit artificial, which is difficult to understand since most of this production was quite natural in appearance. But elsewhere there's plenty of real flora and fauna to keep you believing you're in a botanical place. Overall, this BBC television version is very good in faithfulness to the original book by Frances Hodgson Burnett. It should be enjoyed as a classic by both children and adults.",4,Good TV version of a classic book,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,1051,"['rented', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'technology', 'BBC', 'TV', 'version', 'very', 'close', 'adaptation', 'story', 'acting', 'little', 'stilted', 'beginning', 'better', 'later', 'actors', 'have', 'very', 'realistic', 'accents', 'time', 'place', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'look', 'quite', 'authentic', 'even', 'were', 'filmed', 'Scotland', 'instead', 'England', 'where', 'story', 'set', 'liked', 'appearance', 'English', 'robin', 'program', 'quite', 'different', 'American', 'bird', 'gave', 'original', 'story', 'garden', 'atmosphere', 'garden', 'scenes', 'looked', 'bit', 'artificial', 'difficult', 'understand', 'most', 'production', 'was', 'quite', 'natural', 'appearance', 'elsewhere', 'plenty', 'real', 'flora', 'fauna', 'keep', 'believing', ""'re"", 'botanical', 'place', 'Overall', 'BBC', 'television', 'version', 'very', 'good', 'faithfulness', 'original', 'book', 'Frances', 'Hodgson', 'Burnett', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'classic', 'children', 'adults']",The Secret Garden
907907,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B0009KQPAK,Andrew Raker,"[3, 3]","This 1975 BBC adaptation is the best and most loyal adaptation of the children's classic ""The Secret Garden"" by Frances Hodgson Burnett. At approximately 210 minutes, this adaptation is the only one that does the novel justice.I have also viewed two other adaptations of ""The Secret Garden."" Neither adaptation does the novel justice. Yet, in my opinion the 1987 adaptation by Hallmark is better than the 1993 Warner adaptation. Both the Hallmark and Warner adaptation are about 100 minutes.Below I compare and contrast the three color adaptations.1. The 1975 adaptation BBCThis adaptation is very low budgeted, and it shows in the picture quality, which is painful even if you are used to BBC 4.3 aspect ratio films. This said, the film is QUITE GOOD in every other way if loyalty in plot is important to you. For example, Mr. Archibald Craven, Ben W., Martha, Martha's mother, etc. are given larger roles in this adaptation than in the 1987 and 1993 adaptations. Furthermore, a considerably amount of the dialogue is taken directly from the novel. Therefore, this adaptation is much less 'sound bites' and allows for the development of Mary, Dickon, and Collin's characters.The acting is also considerably better than the 1987 adaptation and better than the 1993 adaptation. [Unfortunately, with child actors of probably 10 or 11 years of age who have memorize a large amount of script, errors will be evident.]Yet, the 1975 adaptation is the best adaptation in my opinion. It is neither too mystical (1993) nor too gothic (1987). I just is the story of a family and a garden that brings them together.I rated this adaptation five starts because of the script and acting - NOT BECAUSE OF THE PICTURE QUALITY, which would have to be rated 1 star or two at most.2. The 1987 adaptation HallmarkAlthough I know many individuals despise this adaptation, I enjoyed it for a change. Yes, the acting is not perfect and the accents are horrible. Yes, the ending is pathetic and quite changed from the novel. Yes, the mystical Dickon (as an adult) dies in World War I. Yet, when one considers what the film was trying to achieve (i.e. change the theme from a children's story to a social critique of problems in society), it does an effective job. The film is a little too gothic (in the Victorian literature definition -i.e. 'ghosts' and long, dark corridors), yet I did not think the gothic harmed the story but rather created a sense of anticipation.Again, if you want a loyal adaptation, I would urge the the 1975 adaptation. However, if you are tired of watching the 1975 adaptation and want to see a change, this 1987 adaptation is a better choice than the 1993 adaptation.3. The 1993 adaptation Time WarnerI disliked this adaptation. My first problem was that Mary's parents were killed in an earthquake rather than a plague. (I am not certain what this proved?). Secondly, the mystical music was annoying as were the inappropriate accents - although of the two, I could tolerate the poor accents much more than the poor music.Additionally, other scenes were also altered. For example, Mary finds the key to the garden in her deceased aunt's bedroom in the shut up wing of the Manor. In the 1975 adaptation (and I think the 1987 adaptation also), Mary finds the key buried with some help from a robin. However, the robin does show Mary where the door to the garden is located.Unfortunately, the other problem I have with this film is that it is centered almost exclusively on Mary's character. Where the 1975 adaptation provides other characters (ex: Martha, Dr. Craven, Sir Archibald Craven, and Martha's mother have with numerous scenes in which Mary does not appear.) In the Warner adaptation, Mary is the focus of nearly every scene.Also, Collin's character was considerably altered into less dictatorial that in the novel the other film adaptations. In fact, at times, Collin appears very childish and timid - terrified of dying and of Mrs. Medlock (rather than bossing Mrs. Medlock, his nurse, and everyone else around). Why Mrs. Medlock and the whole staff of of the Manor had to wear masks when around Collin, I have not a clue? (I forget if everyone wearing a mask was in the novel or not, but it makes no sense in this film adaptation.)However, the film does have some positives. The Manor house is considerably larger than in the 1975 adaptation and larger than the 1987 adaptation, and therefore, it becomes more believable that Mary could have mistaken Collin's crying for the wind, rather than know outrightly that it was someone crying.",5,"The Best Adaptation of ""The Secret Garden""",1259280000,"11 27, 2009",2009,4550,"['1975', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'best', 'most', 'loyal', 'adaptation', 'children', 'classic', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'Frances', 'Hodgson', 'Burnett', 'approximately', '210', 'minutes', 'adaptation', 'only', 'one', 'novel', 'justice.I', 'have', 'also', 'viewed', 'two', 'other', 'adaptations', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'justice', 'opinion', '1987', 'adaptation', 'Hallmark', 'better', '1993', 'Warner', 'adaptation', 'Hallmark', 'Warner', 'adaptation', 'are', '100', 'minutes.Below', 'compare', 'contrast', 'three', 'color', 'adaptations.1', '1975', 'adaptation', 'BBCThis', 'adaptation', 'very', 'low', 'budgeted', 'picture', 'quality', 'painful', 'even', 'are', 'used', 'BBC', '4.3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'films', 'said', 'film', 'QUITE', 'GOOD', 'other', 'way', 'loyalty', 'plot', 'important', 'example', 'Mr.', 'Archibald', 'Craven', 'Ben', 'W.', 'Martha', 'Martha', 'mother', 'etc', 'are', 'given', 'larger', 'roles', 'adaptation', '1987', '1993', 'adaptations', 'Furthermore', 'considerably', 'amount', 'dialogue', 'taken', 'directly', 'novel', 'Therefore', 'adaptation', 'much', 'less', ""'sound"", 'bites', 'allows', 'development', 'Mary', 'Dickon', 'Collin', 'characters.The', 'acting', 'also', 'considerably', 'better', '1987', 'adaptation', 'better', '1993', 'adaptation', '[', 'Unfortunately', 'child', 'actors', 'probably', '10', '11', 'years', 'age', 'who', 'have', 'memorize', 'large', 'amount', 'script', 'errors', 'will', 'be', 'evident', ']', 'Yet', '1975', 'adaptation', 'best', 'adaptation', 'opinion', 'too', 'mystical', '1993', 'too', 'gothic', '1987', 'just', 'story', 'family', 'garden', 'together.I', 'rated', 'adaptation', 'five', 'starts', 'script', 'acting', 'NOT', 'THE', 'PICTURE', 'QUALITY', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'rated', '1', 'star', 'two', 'most.2', '1987', 'adaptation', 'HallmarkAlthough', 'know', 'many', 'individuals', 'despise', 'adaptation', 'enjoyed', 'change', 'Yes', 'acting', 'not', 'perfect', 'accents', 'are', 'horrible', 'Yes', 'ending', 'pathetic', 'quite', 'changed', 'novel', 'Yes', 'mystical', 'Dickon', 'adult', 'World', 'War', 'when', 'one', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'achieve', 'i.e', 'change', 'theme', 'children', 'story', 'social', 'critique', 'problems', 'society', 'effective', 'job', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'gothic', 'Victorian', 'literature', 'definition', '-i.e', ""'ghosts"", 'long', 'dark', 'corridors', 'yet', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'gothic', 'harmed', 'story', 'rather', 'created', 'sense', 'anticipation.Again', 'want', 'loyal', 'adaptation', 'would', 'urge', '1975', 'adaptation', 'However', 'are', 'tired', 'watching', '1975', 'adaptation', 'want', 'see', 'change', '1987', 'adaptation', 'better', 'choice', '1993', 'adaptation.3', '1993', 'adaptation', 'Time', 'WarnerI', 'disliked', 'adaptation', 'first', 'problem', 'was', 'Mary', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'earthquake', 'rather', 'plague', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'what', 'proved', 'Secondly', 'mystical', 'music', 'was', 'annoying', 'were', 'inappropriate', 'accents', 'two', 'could', 'tolerate', 'poor', 'accents', 'much', 'more', 'poor', 'music.Additionally', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'also', 'altered', 'example', 'Mary', 'key', 'garden', 'deceased', 'aunt', 'bedroom', 'shut', 'up', 'wing', 'Manor', '1975', 'adaptation', 'think', '1987', 'adaptation', 'also', 'Mary', 'key', 'buried', 'help', 'robin', 'However', 'robin', 'show', 'Mary', 'where', 'door', 'garden', 'located.Unfortunately', 'other', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'centered', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'Mary', 'character', 'Where', '1975', 'adaptation', 'other', 'characters', 'ex', 'Martha', 'Dr.', 'Craven', 'Sir', 'Archibald', 'Craven', 'Martha', 'mother', 'have', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'Mary', 'not', 'appear', 'Warner', 'adaptation', 'Mary', 'focus', 'nearly', 'scene.Also', 'Collin', 'character', 'was', 'considerably', 'altered', 'less', 'dictatorial', 'novel', 'other', 'film', 'adaptations', 'fact', 'times', 'Collin', 'very', 'childish', 'timid', 'terrified', 'dying', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'rather', 'bossing', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'nurse', 'everyone', 'else', 'Why', 'Mrs.', 'Medlock', 'whole', 'staff', 'Manor', 'had', 'wear', 'masks', 'when', 'Collin', 'have', 'not', 'clue', 'forget', 'everyone', 'wearing', 'mask', 'was', 'novel', 'not', 'sense', 'film', 'adaptation', 'However', 'film', 'have', 'positives', 'Manor', 'house', 'considerably', 'larger', '1975', 'adaptation', 'larger', '1987', 'adaptation', 'therefore', 'more', 'believable', 'Mary', 'could', 'have', 'mistaken', 'Collin', 'crying', 'wind', 'rather', 'know', 'outrightly', 'was', 'someone', 'crying']",The Secret Garden

907909,A358XP3X4U0X45,B0009KQPAK,bookloversfriend,"[90, 93]","It is a pity that so many people are misled into buying the 1993 version or the Hallmark version of this book.  The former is valuable as a study of wooden acting and unbelievable dialogue.  The Hallmark version (as usual) just throws the book away--they can do it better.  The 1949 version also ""improves"" on the book by turning it into a suspense-thriller in the first half and has all the characteristics of '40s movies--phony characters, phony dialogue and big stars.This movie is for people who loved the book; and except for extremely minor flaws which most people will not notice, this movie brings the whole book to life perfectly.  Nothing is left out.  Sarah Hollis Andrews gives a stunning performance for one so young.  None of the California accents of the Hallmark version or the East European characters of the 1993 version.  This is Yorkshire and this is Francis Hodgson Burnett, not Agnieszka Holland.There has been an abridged version on the market for years, cut to make it a full-length movie (100 minutes).  This present version is twice that length.  Even if you have the abridged version, buy this one and see what a difference those cuts make.  The characters are even more sympathetic and more real, and there is time to deal more with all the other characters (the nurse, Dr. Craven, Mr. Craven, etc.) and more time for Mary Lennox and more interaction between Mary and Collin and Dickon.In short, this movie is a treasure and every child above the age of 8 deserves to see this version.  If you are a diehard and want to see the other versions, fine, or if you've already been suckered into buying them.  But get this version.  You'll never watch those other versions again.

I am only sorry that it is dated, with faded color, poor quality video, sound, and very little in the way of a musical score.  That doesn't ruin it for me, but it is a little more work to watch than some of the newer films.If there is ever another try to make this story into a movie or series, I wish they would use this script to work from.  There have been two versions since this one, but neither lives up to the quality of this screenplay.  The 1993 version is beautifully done, but takes too many liberties with the story; changing the plot in some really significant ways.  The 1987 Hallmark version is also OK, but is a  bit dull in comparison, with wooden acting and terrible accents.  The Hallmark version is saved from total ruin by the appearance of a young Colin Firth as the adult Colin Craven - (Another deviation from the original book, but an interesting take all the same.)But this version is excellent - taking enough time for a genuine telling of the whole story.  The cast is perfect, with The character of Mary striking that delicate balance of a good hearted girl who has been made nasty by her circumstances.  She is believable as a little brat, and also believable when Mary's true nature begins to emerge.

This story portrays a time when upper class children forced servants to their knees to shine shoes, threatened servants with punishment, and made 70 year olds stand at attention.  It is also rooted in a time when it was acceptable for parents to care nothing for their children's upbringing and to leave it all to servants--thus the mother and father who didn't love the girl Mary and left her in a cholera epidemic, and the father who neglected Colin to the point that the boy became psychosomatically disabled and left him to the care of a doctor who wanted the boy dead.  Unlike Dickens or Austen whose writings overtly criticize such societal evils, this story takes a neutral (or even positive) stance.  I wouldn't want my kids to watch this.  I would have to explain to them the thoughtless, cruel, savagely proud demeanor of the children in the story.If you are watching this for engaging entertainment, I can only say I found it slow paced in the extreme.  The Yorkshire accents (not at all helped by poor sound quality) will leave many Americans (especially children) unable to follow the dialogue. Cinematography was also less than the usual BBC quality.",1,"slow, poor sound quality, morally bereft",1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,1293,"['adaptation', 'faithful', 'story', 'line', 'accents', 'etc', 'problem', 'story', 'think', 'time', 'passed', 'story', 'time', 'when', 'upper', 'class', 'children', 'forced', 'servants', 'knees', 'shine', 'shoes', 'threatened', 'servants', 'punishment', 'made', '70', 'year', 'olds', 'stand', 'attention', 'also', 'rooted', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'acceptable', 'parents', 'care', 'nothing', 'children', 'upbringing', 'leave', 'servants', 'thus', 'mother', 'father', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'girl', 'Mary', 'left', 'cholera', 'epidemic', 'father', 'who', 'neglected', 'Colin', 'point', 'boy', 'became', 'psychosomatically', 'disabled', 'left', 'care', 'doctor', 'who', 'wanted', 'boy', 'dead', 'Dickens', 'Austen', 'writings', 'overtly', 'criticize', 'such', 'societal', 'evils', 'story', 'neutral', 'even', 'positive', 'stance', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'kids', 'watch', 'would', 'have', 'explain', 'thoughtless', 'cruel', 'savagely', 'proud', 'demeanor', 'children', 'story.If', 'are', 'watching', 'engaging', 'entertainment', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'found', 'slow', 'paced', 'extreme', 'Yorkshire', 'accents', 'not', 'helped', 'poor', 'sound', 'quality', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'Americans', 'especially', 'children', 'unable', 'follow', 'dialogue', 'Cinematography', 'was', 'also', 'less', 'usual', 'BBC', 'quality']",The Secret Garden

I owned a video tape of the theatrical version of this production. The theatrical version was good, but left out rich details of the story. With this DVD, the complete series is available to those who remember watching it on television, and for those who wish to see a version closer to the book.You get more background on Susan Sowerby, and you see her close relationship with Mrs. Medlock. There is also more interaction among Mary Lennox, her cousin Colin Craven, Dickon Sowerby, and Martha Sowerby. There is more of the book in this release.It also presents the story as it was shown on television -- opening and closing credits, theme music. The color of the production then, especially the outdoors scenes was very muted, but some of the indoor scenes have gained more color. The muted color palette doesn't diminish the production, but gives it the feel of watching illustrations from a book. It is totally enjoyable.
