My wife and I loved it, partly because we are Hetty-age.When Hetty turns 60 she decides to account for more than a senior citizen> That role she rejects. She and spouse, Robert, are passionate, in love, sometimes with friction. Hetty catches a needy shoplifter teen, Geoffrey, and the stage is set for their many adventure--27 to be exact. Hetty loathes dishonesty and coerces Geoffrey to help solve mysteries of crime. It's not hard, gritty, dark, or bloody, but a family-viewable crime mystery series for all ages. Comes with plenty of humor with Lancashire country mystery and scenic views.A Pvt.Eye team as heartwarming as case-successful.Regulars: Hetty Wainthropp (Patricia Routledge -`Keeping Up Appearances'); Robert (Derek Benfield -loved him in the early days of `Rumpole of the Bailey'); Geoffrey (Dominic Monaghan -`Lord of the Rings'); DCI Adams (John Graham-Davies); Janet (Suzanne Maddock -""The Bill""). Tons of seasoned guest stars.Closed Captioning for all episodes. Set includes a bonus interview.This fun mystery/crime series needs NO warnings on the DVD box. That's a plus for many home viewers. Refreshing entertainment on the lighter, not darker, side.Each of the 4 included series is also available separately, in case you already own some this complete collection.

1677834,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00GD7UO4G,Jon Wynne,"[11, 11]","It is wonderful that Acorn has chosen to re-release (with closed captioning) the terrific Patricia Routledge series from the mid-nineties: HETTY WAINTHROPP INVESTIGATES.Routledge is best-known for her work in Keeping Up Appearances, a program which seems to be endlessly repeated, usually on PBS. Her Hyacinth Bucket (&#8220;It&#8217;s pronounced bouquet!&#8221;) is a masterpiece of comedic acting, a woman who perceives herself to be much higher on the social ladder than she really is.There is a thread that connects Keeping Up Appearances with HETTY WAINTHROPP INVESTIGATES. Hetty is a sixty year old pre-pensioner who simply refuses to give in to old age and the perceptions that society in general has of those who are &#8220;put out to pasture&#8221;.Through an extraordinary series of low-key events, Hetty has an epiphany: she is &#8220;meant&#8221; to be a detective. At an age when most people are winding down in life, she has discovered her &#8220;gift&#8221; and is just beginning to live. She is re-born.Adding immensely to the show&#8217;s success is Hetty&#8217;s friendship/ mentoring of Geoffrey, a late teen who is badly in need of some stable direction in his life. It is a fresh take on the detective/ sidekick relationship that is made believable by Routledge refusing to play Hetty as a know-it-all, but rather as a nurturing caregiver who genuinely cares for her young charge. She is also passionately vocal about the role of older people in society and is not afraid to tear a strip off anyone who thinks otherwise.Hetty&#8217;s husband, Robert, completes the unlikely triangle, quietly expressing his doubt at first but gradually becoming significantly supportive as he struggles to understand the needs of his spouse.There&#8217;s a fair bit of humour mixed in with the drama and it is testimony to the fine scripts and fully-developed characters that the show balances the two elements with such deft.All of the episodes are fine and some are quite brilliant. As the team&#8217;s reputation grows, their cases become more involving, with season three being probably the best of the lot. It is here that some very notable guest stars appear, such as Ronald Pickup, Richard Pasco and Charles Kay.A great example of the show&#8217;s humour is found in the episode when young Geoffrey is being threatened by a suspect and almost thrown off a balcony. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t. I may not bounce!&#8221; he exclaims.There&#8217;s plenty of bounce in HETTY WAINTHROPP. It has a wonderful light touch to it while still offering involving plots and mysteries.",5,The wonderful Patricia Routledge,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,2580,"['wonderful', 'Acorn', 'chosen', 're-release', 'closed', 'captioning', 'terrific', 'Patricia', 'Routledge', 'series', 'mid-nineties', 'HETTY', 'WAINTHROPP', 'INVESTIGATES.Routledge', 'best-known', 'work', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Appearances', 'program', 'be', 'endlessly', 'repeated', 'usually', 'PBS', 'Hyacinth', 'Bucket', '8220', '8217', 'pronounced', 'bouquet', '8221', 'masterpiece', 'comedic', 'acting', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'much', 'higher', 'social', 'ladder', 'really', 'thread', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Appearances', 'HETTY', 'WAINTHROPP', 'INVESTIGATES', 'Hetty', 'sixty', 'year', 'old', 'pre-pensioner', 'who', 'simply', 'give', 'old', 'age', 'perceptions', 'society', 'general', 'who', 'are', '8220', 'put', 'out', 'pasture', '8221', 'extraordinary', 'series', 'low-key', 'events', 'Hetty', 'epiphany', '8220', 'meant', '8221', 'be', 'detective', 'age', 'when', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'winding', 'down', 'life', 'discovered', '8220', 'gift', '8221', 'just', 'beginning', 'live', 're-born.Adding', 'immensely', 'show', '8217', 's', 'success', 'Hetty', '8217', 'friendship/', 'mentoring', 'Geoffrey', 'late', 'teen', 'who', 'badly', 'need', 'stable', 'direction', 'life', 'fresh', 'take', 'detective/', 'sidekick', 'relationship', 'made', 'believable', 'Routledge', 'refusing', 'play', 'Hetty', 'know-it-all', 'rather', 'nurturing', 'caregiver', 'who', 'genuinely', 'young', 'charge', 'also', 'passionately', 'vocal', 'role', 'older', 'people', 'society', 'not', 'afraid', 'tear', 'strip', 'anyone', 'who', 'otherwise.Hetty', '8217', 's', 'husband', 'Robert', 'unlikely', 'triangle', 'quietly', 'expressing', 'doubt', 'first', 'gradually', 'becoming', 'significantly', 'supportive', 'understand', 'needs', 'spouse.There', '8217', 's', 'fair', 'bit', 'humour', 'mixed', 'drama', 'testimony', 'fine', 'scripts', 'fully-developed', 'characters', 'show', 'two', 'elements', 'such', 'deft.All', 'episodes', 'are', 'fine', 'are', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'team', '8217', 'reputation', 'grows', 'cases', 'become', 'more', 'involving', 'season', 'three', 'being', 'probably', 'best', 'lot', 'here', 'very', 'notable', 'guest', 'stars', 'appear', 'such', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'Richard', 'Pasco', 'Charles', 'Kay.A', 'great', 'example', 'show', '8217', 's', 'humour', 'found', 'episode', 'when', 'young', 'Geoffrey', 'being', 'threatened', 'suspect', 'almost', 'thrown', 'off', 'balcony', '8220', 'Please', 'don', '8217', 'may', 'not', 'bounce', '8221', 'exclaims.There', '8217', 's', 'plenty', 'bounce', 'HETTY', 'WAINTHROPP', 'wonderful', 'light', 'touch', 'still', 'offering', 'involving', 'plots', 'mysteries']",N/A
1677835,A2OC5KD7GE7W38,B00GD7UO4G,June L.,"[7, 7]","Having watched Patricia Routledge for years as Hyacinth Bouquet on Keeping Up Appearances, I knew we were in for a treat when our PBS station announced the arrival of Hetty Wainthropp Investigates.  I was not wrong, and from the very first episode we were intrigued by Hetty, who at sixty decides NOT to fall into retirement, but to make her life matter.  She discovers that she is a Natural Detective (the resident scientist says &#34;busybody&#34; but I disagree.)  She is able to see through artificial behavior, to piece together clues and solve crimes, even grisly murders.  As is often the case with  PBS stations, the funds our station was dependent on were never enough to get all the good shows, and we missed several seasons of Hetty.  Now in this reissue of the collection from Acorn Media, we can enjoy every episode.  For fans of THE LORD OF THE RINGS and LOST, Hetty's assistant in her detective business is a youthful Dominic Monaghan.",5,Hurrah for Hetty!!!,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,950,"['Having', 'watched', 'Patricia', 'Routledge', 'years', 'Hyacinth', 'Bouquet', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Appearances', 'knew', 'were', 'treat', 'when', 'PBS', 'station', 'announced', 'arrival', 'Hetty', 'Wainthropp', 'Investigates', 'was', 'not', 'wrong', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'were', 'intrigued', 'Hetty', 'who', 'sixty', 'decides', 'NOT', 'fall', 'retirement', 'make', 'life', 'matter', 'Natural', 'Detective', 'resident', 'scientist', '34', 'busybody', '34', 'disagree', 'able', 'see', 'artificial', 'behavior', 'piece', 'together', 'clues', 'solve', 'crimes', 'even', 'grisly', 'murders', 'often', 'case', 'PBS', 'stations', 'funds', 'station', 'was', 'dependent', 'were', 'never', 'enough', 'get', 'good', 'shows', 'missed', 'several', 'seasons', 'Hetty', 'Now', 'reissue', 'collection', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'can', 'enjoy', 'episode', 'fans', 'THE', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'LOST', 'Hetty', 'assistant', 'detective', 'business', 'youthful', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan']",N/A
