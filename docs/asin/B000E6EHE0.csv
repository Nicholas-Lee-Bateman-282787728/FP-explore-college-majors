Because this moie gives you just what you don't like.I am not usually a fan of romantic comedies, but my interest in Ryan Reynolds led me to buying this DVD on a whim. And, I was not disappointed.(Read synopsis for what the film is about)I absolutly enjoyed the comedic mishaps of Chris Brander as he tried to win the heart of his high school crush. I also fell over laughing at the other cast of characters that accompanied Brander on his quest: Brander's younger brother; his pop-star diva ""girlfriend"", and his arch-rival.

969092,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000E6EHE0,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","My best friend asked me the other day if I had ever seen this movie, to which I replied ""no, it looked retarded.""  He then proceeded to try and convince me that it was hilarious and that I needed to see it as soon as possible.  So I did, that night, rent this movie and I have to admit that my preconceived notion of what I was going to experience was very wrong.  Thanks in large part to the revelation that is Anna Faris, `Just Friends' is actually extremely funny.  Sadly, when Faris is not on the screen the film lags a little, but just a little.The film opens with a hilarious scene where the obese Chris Brander sings All 4 One's `I Swear' while preparing to make the moves on his best friend Jamie Palamino.  She's the hot girl and he's her fat best friend.  The evening turns into a major debacle and Chris winds up leaving in tears.  Cut to ten years later and Chris is not so big anymore; in fact he's one great looking physical specimen.  With his new body came a new attitude (not a very good one) and a new career.  An unexpected snag in plans leaves Chris in his hometown after swearing never to return and this leaves him in an awkward situation.  Jamie is still around and feelings are obviously still there, but can someone ever really escape the `friend zone'?Ryan Reynolds is not the greatest actor.  I actually loved his performance in `The Amityville Horror' and had high hopes for him, but aside from that one performance he's a little stale.  Here he manages a few laughs (especially when in the fat suit) but comes off a bit mechanical.  I didn't really get his character (is he really that much of a jerk or just playing a part?) but he was forgivable.  Amy Smart is her same sweet sexy self and delivers yet another decent performance.  Again, she's not the greatest actress in the world but she works.  Chris Klein (an actor I'm not too fond of) actually makes his soft spoken delivery work for him here and stands out as a great addition to the film.  Chris Marquette is funny as Chris's younger brother Mike and Julie Hagerty is hilarious as Chris's mother Carol.But I must stress yet again that this movie belongs to Anna Faris, who plays rising pop star Samantha James with such ferocious comedic timing you just wish the whole movie were about her.  I would venture to say that this is the best thing Faris has ever done and cannot wait for her to top this.  Why doesn't she have a bigger career yet?`Just Friends' works at getting to our funny bone and that's really all we can ask for with a comedy of this nature.  It's not your `mature' comedy like `Lost in Translation' or `Sideways' but it proves to be an above average generic comedy that makes it's weaknesses work for itself and creates a memorable experience the viewer can fully enjoy and one that you'll soon want to revisit.",3,Just plain fun; nothing wrong with that...,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,2819,"['best', 'friend', 'asked', 'other', 'day', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'replied', 'no', 'looked', 'retarded', 'then', 'proceeded', 'try', 'convince', 'was', 'hilarious', 'needed', 'see', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'did', 'night', 'rent', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'experience', 'was', 'very', 'wrong', 'Thanks', 'large', 'part', 'revelation', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Just', 'Friends', 'actually', 'extremely', 'funny', 'Sadly', 'when', 'Faris', 'not', 'screen', 'film', 'little', 'just', 'little.The', 'film', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'where', 'obese', 'Chris', 'Brander', '4', 'One', 'Swear', 'preparing', 'make', 'moves', 'best', 'friend', 'Jamie', 'Palamino', 'hot', 'girl', 'fat', 'best', 'friend', 'evening', 'major', 'debacle', 'Chris', 'up', 'leaving', 'tears', 'Cut', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Chris', 'not', 'so', 'big', 'anymore', 'fact', 'one', 'great', 'looking', 'physical', 'specimen', 'new', 'body', 'came', 'new', 'attitude', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'new', 'career', 'unexpected', 'snag', 'plans', 'leaves', 'Chris', 'hometown', 'swearing', 'never', 'return', 'awkward', 'situation', 'Jamie', 'still', 'around', 'feelings', 'are', 'obviously', 'still', 'there', 'can', 'someone', 'ever', 'really', 'escape', 'friend', 'zone', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'not', 'greatest', 'actor', 'actually', 'loved', 'performance', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'aside', 'one', 'performance', 'little', 'stale', 'Here', 'few', 'laughs', 'especially', 'when', 'fat', 'suit', 'off', 'bit', 'mechanical', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'character', 'really', 'much', 'jerk', 'just', 'playing', 'part', 'was', 'forgivable', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'same', 'sweet', 'sexy', 'self', 'delivers', 'yet', 'decent', 'performance', 'Again', 'not', 'greatest', 'actress', 'world', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'actor', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'fond', 'actually', 'soft', 'spoken', 'delivery', 'work', 'here', 'out', 'great', 'addition', 'film', 'Chris', 'Marquette', 'funny', 'Chris', 'younger', 'brother', 'Mike', 'Julie', 'Hagerty', 'hilarious', 'Chris', 'mother', 'Carol.But', 'must', 'stress', 'yet', 'again', 'movie', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'who', 'rising', 'pop', 'star', 'Samantha', 'James', 'such', 'ferocious', 'comedic', 'timing', 'just', 'wish', 'whole', 'movie', 'were', 'would', 'venture', 'say', 'best', 'thing', 'Faris', 'ever', 'done', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'top', 'Why', ""n't"", 'have', 'bigger', 'career', 'yet', 'Just', 'Friends', 'works', 'getting', 'funny', 'bone', 'really', 'can', 'ask', 'comedy', 'nature', 'not', 'mature', 'comedy', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Sideways', 'be', 'above', 'average', 'generic', 'comedy', 'weaknesses', 'work', 'memorable', 'experience', 'viewer', 'can', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'one', ""'ll"", 'soon', 'want', 'revisit']",N/A
969093,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B000E6EHE0,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[5, 6]","I didn't really like Waiting, another Ryan Reynolds film. So I was leery about this one, but my sister assured me that it was totally different, and boy, was she right. This one's in the romantic comedy category, but with an American Pie attitude, which makes for a very funny movie. And I've never liked Ryan Reynolds more.Reynolds plays Chris, a guy who was fat and unpopular in high school, but had a really great friend (played by Amy Smart) who hung out with him and had sleepovers w/him. Unfortunately, he saw her as more than just a friend, but she didn't feel the same way at all. After an embarrassing moment at a grad party, he gets on his bike and rides away, saying, ""This town if full of losers, and I'm pulling out to win!"" Flash forward ten years-- Chris is now a total hottie with a body and has a flashy job in L.A. working for a record label. He has to escort the pop princess Samantha James (the hilarious Anna Faris) to Paris. But when their flight is grounded in Jersey because of an onboard fire (thanks to Samantha!), Chris heads back to his home to catch up with his mother and little brother, and maybe regain what he lost when he left-- the girl of his dreams. Throw in a wacky little brother (played by Chris Marquette, whom you will LOVE in this role!!!) and another cute guy (Chris Klein) and you've got some serious obstacles!Such a funny movie, really good physical comedy on Reynolds' part, he really reminded me of Jim Carrey in this movie, especially in that car scene when he's lamenting over his crappy first ""date"" with Jamie. Reynolds and Marquette are hilarious together; man, brothers sure know how to push each others buttons.

969094,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000E6EHE0,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[3, 5]","Okay, so I'm a year late with this one. Thanks to the On Demand service, I catch movies they have listed that I would normally not catch. This is one of them. I'm happy that I stumbled upon this quiet little comedy. Don't take that that this movie is a ""golden winner"" by any standards. This film doesn't ask much from the audience, but it's a decent enough experience to waste 95 minutes of your time. ""Just Friends"" doesn't re-invent the wheel for comedies or romantic comedies, but it's simple, pleasurable existence is enough. The always watchable and appealing Ryan Reynolds stars as Chris Brander, a guy who was pretty much on the outside in high school. He was overweight, had a retainer, and had frizzy hair that would make Richard Simmons jealous. He was always the best friend of sweet and cute Jamie Pallamino(Amy Smart), but he, like others like him, always wanted to be more. After a humiliating experience, we flash forward ten years to find Chris as a slim and attractive guy swimming in the high life with houses and money and all. He returns to his hometown after a plane mishap, runs back into Jamie, and the flames rekindled again. However, Chris faces some competition in the form of former nerd Dusty Dinkelman(Chris Klein). In his way is Samantha(Anna Faris), a pompus, shallow pop singer who thinks she is Chris' girlfriend. Reynolds has been funny and charming in the past, but it doesn't quite work here. He is the funniest in his high school days. Amy Smart is awfully cute, but there is no real insight or deep development for her characte. But she is so darn sweet and cute, that you understand why someone would want her as their significant other. But it's Faris who steals the show. Her over the top performance as a Britney-like pop singer who wants to be seen as more of an 'artiste' is hilarious, and provides most of the film's bigger laughs. Her ""ice pack on head-toothpaste"" scene is a particular highlight. The setting is nice and the holiday season this is placed against is always nice to me. What doesn't work here is that it is all very familiar. Walking along very familiar ground. The script pretty much follows the blue print of every other kind of movie like this. It goes from point A to point B to point C, and you will know how it gets to these points and what will happen before the film gets there. You are not going to get any surprises with ""Just Friends"", but then the filmmakers weren't trying for that to happen. Also, there is the character of Chris. He's a good guy and all, but you just don't really feel any sympathy for him in any of the stages of his life. Fat Chris or Thin, Rich Chris. It's a definite problem when you aren't feeling much for the hero of the story who tries to get the girl. The actors are good enough, appealing enough(some of them), and there are some genuine parts that are very laugh-worthy, but in the end, it's ""been there, seen that, got the free t-shirt"". Other pluses for the film include Julie Hagerty(of ""Airplane"" fame)appearing as Chris' mom. She is a funny lady, funny here, and we don't see her often enough. Chris Klein also appears and plays mostly against type. In the end, ""Just Friends"" is a carbon copy of a carbon copy, but there are much worse ways to send an hour and a half.",3,"Hello, Joyce?",1163980800,"11 20, 2006",2006,3280,"['Okay', ""'m"", 'year', 'late', 'one', 'Demand', 'service', 'catch', 'movies', 'have', 'listed', 'would', 'normally', 'not', 'catch', 'one', ""'m"", 'happy', 'stumbled', 'quiet', 'little', 'comedy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'movie', 'golden', 'winner', 'standards', 'film', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'audience', 'decent', 'enough', 'experience', 'waste', '95', 'minutes', 'time', 'Just', 'Friends', ""n't"", 're-invent', 'wheel', 'comedies', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'simple', 'pleasurable', 'existence', 'enough', 'always', 'watchable', 'appealing', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Chris', 'Brander', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'outside', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'overweight', 'had', 'retainer', 'had', 'frizzy', 'hair', 'would', 'make', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'jealous', 'was', 'always', 'best', 'friend', 'sweet', 'cute', 'Jamie', 'Pallamino', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'others', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'more', 'humiliating', 'experience', 'flash', 'forward', 'ten', 'years', 'find', 'Chris', 'slim', 'attractive', 'guy', 'swimming', 'high', 'life', 'houses', 'money', 'hometown', 'plane', 'mishap', 'back', 'Jamie', 'flames', 'rekindled', 'again', 'However', 'Chris', 'competition', 'form', 'former', 'nerd', 'Dusty', 'Dinkelman', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'way', 'Samantha', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'pompus', 'shallow', 'pop', 'singer', 'who', 'Chris', 'girlfriend', 'Reynolds', 'been', 'funny', 'charming', 'past', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'here', 'funniest', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'awfully', 'cute', 'real', 'insight', 'deep', 'development', 'characte', 'so', 'darn', 'sweet', 'cute', 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'want', 'significant', 'other', 'Faris', 'who', 'show', 'top', 'performance', 'Britney-like', 'pop', 'singer', 'who', 'be', 'seen', 'more', ""'artiste"", 'hilarious', 'most', 'film', 'bigger', 'laughs', 'ice', 'pack', 'head-toothpaste', 'scene', 'particular', 'highlight', 'setting', 'nice', 'holiday', 'season', 'placed', 'always', 'nice', 'What', ""n't"", 'work', 'here', 'very', 'familiar', 'Walking', 'along', 'very', 'familiar', 'ground', 'script', 'pretty', 'much', 'blue', 'print', 'other', 'kind', 'movie', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'point', 'C', 'will', 'know', 'how', 'points', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'film', 'there', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'surprises', 'Just', 'Friends', 'then', 'filmmakers', 'were', ""n't"", 'trying', 'happen', 'Also', 'character', 'Chris', 'good', 'guy', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'stages', 'life', 'Fat', 'Chris', 'Thin', 'Rich', 'Chris', 'definite', 'problem', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'much', 'hero', 'story', 'who', 'get', 'girl', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'appealing', 'enough', 'are', 'genuine', 'parts', 'are', 'very', 'laugh-worthy', 'end', 'been', 'there', 'seen', 'got', 'free', 't-shirt', 'Other', 'pluses', 'film', 'include', 'Julie', 'Hagerty', 'Airplane', 'fame', 'appearing', 'Chris', 'mom', 'funny', 'lady', 'funny', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'often', 'enough', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'also', 'mostly', 'type', 'end', 'Just', 'Friends', 'carbon', 'copy', 'carbon', 'copy', 'are', 'much', 'worse', 'ways', 'send', 'hour', 'half']",N/A

I watched it last weekend and loved it, laughing almost the entire way through. This isn't a great cinematic masterpiece by any means, but it succeeded in making me laugh, which is good enough for me.The movie works because of the cast. Ryan Reynolds was a nerdy, fat kid in high school who was best friends with the beautiful Amy Smart. But, he wanted to be more than friends, and when he revealed his feelings, he was humiliated. He left town and became a successful music industry professional. One day, he gets the assignment of baby sitting spoiled pop star Anna Farris. Plane problems force them to land close to Reynold's home town.He goes home, bringing Farris with him, and he encounters his long lost best friend. Much of the movie is predictable. She doesn't like him, he still acts stupid, she thinks he's a jerk, he acts like a jerk, another man tries to woo her. But the cast is hilarious. Anna Farris steals every scene she's in. She's great at playing crazy people. I also loved the slapstick in the movie. It brought a fun innoncence to the film.I wish I'd seen this movie sooner.

Using humor that is black and evil down to its bones, ""Just Friends"" had me in a state of joy as director Roger Kumble takes a blowtorch to everything in general and small town America in particular. By telling this tale of Chris (Ryan Reynolds), who was rejected by the girl of his dreams Jamie (Amy Smart) because she just wanted to be friends, as he returns home much lighter ten years later this film uncovers some pretty uncomfortable truths about the war of the sexes. The main issue at hand is the tendency by females everywhere to tag nice guys as friends and then cut them off from any sex. . .ever. If this is the case how can we feel bad for Jamie in this film? Hasn't she done it to herself? My entire 11th grade memory block has forever been smeared by a girl telling me that she just wanted to be friends, so to a degree this film struck a chord with me before it even began.I would say that at its core this film is a revenge fantasy, a former ugly duckling returns home to a town that had rejected him only to mock it using his new found superiority. His weakness is that he still carries a big ole torch for Jamie, and it is going to take more than a slimmed down bod and high paying salary to win her over. First he tries being a jerk, then a sensitive guy, but he just can't catch a break. Chris Klein plays his foil and steals the movie as a hyper sensitive doofus who sugar coats everything he does to an absurd degree. Also along for the ride is Anna Faris, playing Samantha a self-involved, off kilter Paris Hilton knock off who makes you want to cut yourself. Her shameless performance was also perfect and definitely worth an honorable mention. At times it does become predictable. We get the all too familiar scene where Chris is embarrassed in front of a bunch of kids. We also get to watch as a big ole Christmas set piece is destroyed, but the secret here is that deep down you wish that the fire would've kept on blazing, taking down the rest of this backwards town with it.From the powerhouse opening sequence which was a mortifying reminder of why I didn't go to parties in high school through the closing credits this film delivered laugh after laugh. Kumble clearly hates all of his characters and relishes the opportunities to humiliate them time and time again. Even sweet old Mom comes off as mildly retarded as she wanders around spouting off ""good"" advice like, ""Just be yourself."" Has there ever been worse advice in the history of dating? In the end the film does turn its back, ever so slightly, on everything that it stood for, a la ""Waiting. . ."", but that's Hollywood for ya. I didn't mind though because I was still catching my breath from watching Samantha deal with Chris' rejection of her for Jamie by yelling, ""Sorry I'm not the most boring person ever!"" As far as Ryan Reynolds movies go I'm pretty sure that this will be considered the gold standard. . .forever. Funny for normal people, a laugh riot for haters of humanity.

Full of all the high school sterotypes, the popular group, the jocks, the cheerleaders, the ""nerds"", and the outcasts, I find this very easy to fall into the high school rut again.Brief synopsis:This is the story of a once chubby high school boy (played by ryan reynolds) who on the day of graduation wants to profess his love to his best friend (played by amy smart). They have known each other since 6th grade, and have always been ""just friends"", but he now wants more.  He writes his confession in his yearbook, which accidently gets switched before he can give it to her.  Unfortunately, one of the school bullies has it and reads it in front of the whole senior class.  This sends ryan reynolds running from the house, and from New Jersey for 10 years.He moves to california, becomes wealthy and popular, and a player, all based on rules from this break-up.  By happenstance, on a PR stint with the worlds most annoying pop star (paris hilton like), he gets stranded in his home town for the christmas holidays, and he is left re-connecting with his old friends, and feels he has something to prove.  He want's to show Amy Smart that she is missing out on him, but through missadventures, falls back into the ""friendzone"".  Watch this movie, see if he is able to show everyone he's now Mr. Cool, or see if he fall flat on his face with no friends again.All in all, very worth the purchase price, funny clever, the alternate endings on the DVD is funny also, could have worked, the behind the scenes are enlightening.

And like so many stars today, Farris turns out to be a no-talent, annoying, hack in the movie - think Paris Hilton (in real life I think Anna is a great actress).Instructed to stay by their new star's side, Reynolds soon finds himself stranded back home in New Jersey where he of course runs back into Smart.

Chums. Buddies.In this case, the fat guy who can't get the girl moves to Los Angeles, loses about 200 pounds and most of his personality (having been taken over by the pod people who inhabit the L.A. entertainment planet) and then fate brings him back to Ms. Right. Who lives in New Jersey.Yes, there had to be a catch. It can be maudlin, mawkish, predictable, sentimental, prone to cheap laughs and starring Ryan Reynolds (who seems to be doing a Jason Lee impersonation), but ""Just Friends"" can also be absolutely hysterical once the erstwhile expanse of human acreage Chris Brander (Reynolds) finds himself back at his childhood home, and starts reverting to his childhood.A slicker-than-hair-mousse L.A. record exec, Chris is escorting untalented sex bomb Samantha James (Anna Faris) to Paris, when their plane makes an unscheduled landing near Trenton. With nowhere else to go -- and it being Christmastime -- they end up at the home of Chris' mom (Julie Hagerty) and brother Mike (Christopher Marquette), who affixes himself to Samantha like a rutting hedgehog. Meanwhile, the long-suffering Chris is trying to figure out how to work his way back into the heart of Jamie Palomino (Amy Smart), the girl he loved, and who wanted to be friends.""Just Friends"" is funnier the sillier it gets, perhaps hitting a crescendo during the slap fights between the brothers, who begin beating each other with regularity, as if they'd never stopped.Chris, who begins his Amy campaign acting cool and sophisticated, finds that doesn't work. So he goes the other way -- and becomes a character unable to modulate himself to the right frequency, one where Jamie can hear him. Although Faris is quite game as the slutty, outlandish Samantha, she's too strong for the general tone of the film, which in a kind of transcendent way is about how easy it is to become the person we used to be, when we're in the place we used to live.",3,Ryan Reynolds return to comedy... and I was disappointed,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,2150,"['Just', 'Friends', 'director', 'Roger', 'Kumble', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'underrated', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'comedy', 'Sweetest', 'Thing', 'what', 'awful', 'moment', 'when', 'girl', 'dreams', 'just', 'be', 'pals', 'Chums', 'Buddies.In', 'case', 'fat', 'guy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'girl', 'Los', 'Angeles', '200', 'pounds', 'most', 'personality', 'having', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'pod', 'people', 'who', 'inhabit', 'L.A.', 'entertainment', 'planet', 'then', 'fate', 'brings', 'back', 'Ms', 'Right', 'Who', 'New', 'Jersey.Yes', 'had', 'be', 'catch', 'can', 'be', 'maudlin', 'mawkish', 'predictable', 'sentimental', 'prone', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'starring', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'be', 'doing', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'impersonation', 'Just', 'Friends', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'erstwhile', 'expanse', 'human', 'acreage', 'Chris', 'Brander', 'Reynolds', 'back', 'childhood', 'home', 'reverting', 'childhood.A', 'slicker-than-hair-mousse', 'L.A.', 'record', 'exec', 'Chris', 'escorting', 'untalented', 'sex', 'bomb', 'Samantha', 'James', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Paris', 'when', 'plane', 'unscheduled', 'landing', 'Trenton', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', 'being', 'Christmastime', 'end', 'up', 'home', 'Chris', 'mom', 'Julie', 'Hagerty', 'Mike', 'Christopher', 'Marquette', 'who', 'affixes', 'Samantha', 'rutting', 'hedgehog', 'Meanwhile', 'long-suffering', 'Chris', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'work', 'way', 'back', 'heart', 'Jamie', 'Palomino', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'girl', 'loved', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'friends', 'Just', 'Friends', 'funnier', 'sillier', 'perhaps', 'hitting', 'crescendo', 'slap', 'fights', 'brothers', 'who', 'begin', 'beating', 'other', 'regularity', ""'d"", 'never', 'stopped.Chris', 'who', 'Amy', 'campaign', 'acting', 'cool', 'sophisticated', ""n't"", 'work', 'other', 'way', 'character', 'unable', 'modulate', 'right', 'frequency', 'one', 'where', 'Jamie', 'can', 'hear', 'Faris', 'quite', 'game', 'slutty', 'outlandish', 'Samantha', 'too', 'strong', 'general', 'tone', 'film', 'kind', 'transcendent', 'way', 'how', 'easy', 'become', 'person', 'used', 'be', 'when', ""'re"", 'place', 'used', 'live']",N/A

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","Ryan Reynolds reminds me of the pompous jerk back in my high school days, the kind of arrogant, shallow, superficial nobody we would give wedgies to after gym class.  So any movie featuring an actor who conjures up all of these images and feelings is inherently behind the eight-ball; the film is going to have to have something else going for it to entreat me to even watch.Such is the case with JUST FRIENDS.  And I still don't know why.Yes I do.  Anna Faris and Chris Marquette.  Faris, playing an airhead Hollywood diva (and a very emotionally unstable one at that), is over the top in a very good way, while Marquette, playing kid brother to Reynolds, is hysterical.  When these two actors are on screen I stand up and pay attention.  Plus JUST FRIENDS has more than its fair share of physical comedy, which I grudgingly admit Reynolds does well.A former porker who is now a Hollywood big shot (Reynolds) comes back to his Jersey hometown to discover he still has romantic feelings for the love of his adolescent life (Amy Smart)--even though their relationship was always benignly platonic.  Meanwhile he must pacify his out-of-control client (Faris), who is not enjoying her stay in the frigid Jersey town as Yuletide approaches.  Self-denial, misunderstanding, pride, and then mayhem ensue; the result, comedic bliss.  Then JUST FRIENDS wraps up its closing credits featuring Reynolds in a fat suit lip syncing a Boyz II Men ballad.  Can't think of a better way to watch this guy perform.--D.

Chris (Ryan Reynolds) was the quintessential nice guy, great friend all through high school with Jamie (the lovely Amy Smart).  He was a bit overweight and the kids were kind of mean to him about it.  Years pass and he comes back, lost the weight, in excellent shape, and has a career as a well known music exec.  He's intent on winning Jamie this time.  Enter Anna Faris (as a Britney Spears type, and really ditzy but in a hilarious way), and Chris Klein as a musician trying to win Jamie also.

No matter which situation you have been in between those two choices every one can appreciate this film for what it is, a film about wanting to be more then friends. When this film was first released I wanted to see it based on one thing, it starred Ryan Reynolds. I have been a fan of his since his sitcom days on a little show called ""Two Guys, a Girl, & a Pizza Place"" the pizza place part was eventually dropped from the title and Reynolds went on to fame later after starring in a National Lampoon movie called ""Van Wilder"". Now out of the show and the movie I am sure most of you at least remember the movie, it even spawned a sequel for Taj. So off I was to view this film and of course like I thought I liked it and bought the DVD when it eventually hit the store shelves.The movie is all about a young man that was a little over weight as a kid and was teased, ridiculed and longed for his best friend played by the lovely Amy Smart. Of course things don't work out the way he wanted, in fact the end up horrible as he storms out of a party never to be seen again. Turns out years later he became a very fit and healthy successful man who worked in the entertainment industry. One day while at the office his boss informs him that he is going off with a diva wanna be played masterfully by Anna Faris, and is to woo her into coming to their label. Well he has a history with this girl and she takes his being there as a sign that they are back together, imagine his surprise when he gets stuck with her in his hometown after the plan has to land. So once there he goes to see his family and old friends, it is here that he runs into Jamie again and he is quick to show off. So the film goes into a full on comedic roll as Chris makes it his mission to get Jamie back for ignoring his earlier love, of course Anna Faris's character is not happy with this but she is pawned off on Chris's little brother [who is hilarious, and their fights remind me of myself and my brother] who is obsessed with her. but soon Chris starts to regain those old feelings and really tries to be with her but a challenge is on the horizon, a former fellow ""just friend"" played by Chris Klein. The guy is just to smooth for him at first even though Chris knows this guy's real motive about getting with her. So the war is on between these two newly successful guys, one wants her for her while the other wants something else.Ryan Reynolds is perfect as the former heavyweight that makes good later in life, he has a perfect sense of timing and is great in this comedy. Reynolds has always been one of my favorite comedic actors and while the film is not perfect is performance is. Same can be said for co star Amy Smart who is great in the role of the girl who every body wants and peaked in high school, love that line. Chris Klein is great as well as the opposition to Ryan and plays both the good guy and jerk really well, but it is Anna Faris who steals the show a little in my opinion. She is very annoying but in good way, an entertaining way, she is definitely one of the best female comedic performers out there. She is so over the top and crazy in this film it is hard not to like her character, she is off the hook. Everybody who is in this movie all do great jobs and add to the hilarity of the situations, kinda reminds me of ""Christmas Vacation {that film is a classic}. Writer Adam Davis, director Roger Kumble, and one of the many producers made this film based on things that really happened to them so I believe that the really wanted this film to work, in my opinion it does.I enjoyed this movie a lot mainly because of the brothers fighting all the time, but the whole thing was good. I would not say that this is a classic but it is a good movie. I would say it is at least a rental but I recommend buying it, it is an entertaining film and I think you will like it. I feel like something is missing though and that is to bad because it holds this film back from being a classic comedy. Still it is very enjoyable and worth a viewing if you want to watch a comedy one night.",4,STILL GOT THAT CHRISTMAS SPIRIT,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,4223,"['JUST', 'FRIENDSWe', 'have', 'been', 'situation', 'have', 'known', 'one', 'who', 'totally', 'love', 'somebody', 'stuck', 'friend', 'zone', 'matter', 'situation', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'choices', 'one', 'can', 'appreciate', 'film', 'what', 'film', 'wanting', 'be', 'more', 'then', 'friends', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'wanted', 'see', 'based', 'one', 'thing', 'starred', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'sitcom', 'days', 'little', 'show', 'called', 'Two', 'Guys', 'Girl', 'Pizza', 'Place', 'pizza', 'place', 'part', 'was', 'eventually', 'dropped', 'title', 'Reynolds', 'went', 'fame', 'later', 'starring', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'movie', 'called', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'Now', 'show', 'movie', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'least', 'remember', 'movie', 'even', 'spawned', 'sequel', 'Taj', 'was', 'view', 'film', 'course', 'thought', 'liked', 'bought', 'DVD', 'when', 'eventually', 'hit', 'store', 'shelves.The', 'movie', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'little', 'over', 'weight', 'kid', 'was', 'teased', 'ridiculed', 'longed', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'lovely', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'course', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'way', 'wanted', 'fact', 'end', 'up', 'horrible', 'party', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'out', 'years', 'later', 'became', 'very', 'fit', 'healthy', 'successful', 'man', 'who', 'worked', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'One', 'day', 'office', 'boss', 'going', 'off', 'diva', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'woo', 'coming', 'label', 'Well', 'history', 'girl', 'being', 'there', 'sign', 'are', 'back', 'together', 'imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'stuck', 'hometown', 'plan', 'land', 'So', 'once', 'see', 'family', 'old', 'friends', 'here', 'Jamie', 'again', 'quick', 'show', 'off', 'film', 'full', 'comedic', 'roll', 'Chris', 'mission', 'get', 'Jamie', 'back', 'ignoring', 'earlier', 'love', 'course', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'character', 'not', 'happy', 'pawned', 'off', 'Chris', 'little', 'brother', '[', 'who', 'hilarious', 'fights', 'brother', ']', 'who', 'obsessed', 'soon', 'Chris', 'regain', 'old', 'feelings', 'really', 'tries', 'be', 'challenge', 'horizon', 'former', 'fellow', 'just', 'friend', 'played', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'guy', 'just', 'smooth', 'first', 'even', 'Chris', 'guy', 'real', 'motive', 'getting', 'war', 'two', 'newly', 'successful', 'guys', 'one', 'other', 'something', 'else.Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'perfect', 'former', 'heavyweight', 'good', 'later', 'life', 'perfect', 'sense', 'timing', 'great', 'comedy', 'Reynolds', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedic', 'actors', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'performance', 'Same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'co', 'star', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'who', 'great', 'role', 'girl', 'who', 'body', 'peaked', 'high', 'school', 'love', 'line', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'opposition', 'Ryan', 'good', 'guy', 'jerk', 'really', 'well', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'who', 'show', 'little', 'opinion', 'very', 'annoying', 'good', 'way', 'entertaining', 'way', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'female', 'comedic', 'performers', 'out', 'there', 'so', 'top', 'crazy', 'film', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'character', 'hook', 'Everybody', 'who', 'movie', 'do', 'great', 'jobs', 'add', 'hilarity', 'situations', 'kinda', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'film', 'classic', 'Writer', 'Adam', 'Davis', 'director', 'Roger', 'Kumble', 'one', 'many', 'producers', 'made', 'film', 'based', 'things', 'really', 'happened', 'so', 'believe', 'really', 'wanted', 'film', 'work', 'opinion', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'lot', 'mainly', 'brothers', 'fighting', 'time', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'good', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'classic', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'least', 'rental', 'recommend', 'buying', 'entertaining', 'film', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'feel', 'something', 'missing', 'bad', 'film', 'back', 'being', 'classic', 'comedy', 'Still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'want', 'watch', 'comedy', 'one', 'night']",N/A

The movie is really funny, even though Ryan Reynolds seems to get possessed by the spirit of Jim Carrey at times in the film. Anna Faris is the reason to watch the film, she is always as show in itself since she is always great at playing the dumb blonde like in the Scary Movie series. I have to admit, this film just has a lot of laughs, which is a surprise to me. This isn't a Christmas movie, so don't be fooled into thinking so by the cover of the DVD. The story just happens to take place during the Christmas season, but very little (like 2%) of the film even mentions anything Christmas or holiday related.

Written as a series of one-liner unfunny jokes by Adam 'Tex' Davis and directed by Roger Kumble in the 'National Lampoon' manner, this is an overly long attempt to entertain that gets lost in all the disasters that befall the characters.1995 and Chris Brander (the hugely talented but consistently miscast Ryan Reynolds) is an obese loser Friend cum potential boyfriend of bouncy popular cheerleader Jamie Palomino (Amy Smart) who, after a graduation party demeaning Chris in every way, is forced to leave New Jersey to change his life in Los Angeles.  Ten years later the very hunky and buff Chris is now a wealthy music executive forced to travel with the music company's latest 'discovery', the flamboyant but untalented oversexed Samantha James (Anna Faris).  When their private jet is forced to land due to Samantha's brainless mistake with the microwave, the two find they are in New Jersey (surprise) and must spend the night - well, next few days. During this time Chris encounters  Jamie, decides to win her back by treating her poorly (!), is in competition with another highschool loser Dusty (Chris Klein) who has  likewise blossomed into a hunk in the intervening years and the remainder of the film is a series of silly incidents and gross errors about how Chris and Jamie and Dusty interact - one disaster after another.Ryan Reynolds is a natural comedian with one of the keenest senses of timing around, but even this talented actor can't save this superficial waste of time.  Likewise, Amy Smart, Chris Klein and the very promising Anna Faris as well as Julie Hagerty and Chris Marquette in cameo roles are truly excellent actors bogged down with a miserable script.  This is a movie that only fans of the stars should bother with seeing as it has little else going for it.

I must mention that the film has a decent OST and a few characters that made you laugh. The character of the superstar was funny while Amy Smart's role was not too inspiring. Ryan Renold has, most definitely, ensured himself a career in comedy films.

969131,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000E6EHE0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[20, 22]","At a high school graduation party, overweight Chris Brander (Ryan Reynolds) attempts to reveal his true feelings for his best friend Jamie Palomino (Amy Smart), but ends up making an utter fool of himself. What's worse, his humiliation takes place in front of his jeering teenage peers. A decade later, Chris has become a success story. He is now thin, prosperous, is a hit with girls, and works as an executive in the music industry. His latest assignment is escorting wacky starlet/pop princess and ex-flame Samantha James (Anna Faris) to Paris, France. But their plane has to make an unscheduled landing in Jersey, Chris's high school home. Rationally, Chris and Samantha decide to stay at his old house. Chris has a reunion with his former buddies, including the winsome Jamie, who immediately rekindles that old spark within Chris. The remainder of the film concerns Chris's efforts to make Jamie see him as more than a friend, while simultaneously fending off the warped Samantha. Competition comes in the form of a former fellow nerd turned sensitive guy Dusty Dinkleman (Chris Klein).Just Friends is a very funny, feel-good movie. Ryan Reynolds is a hoot as a brash L.A. stud who disastrously channels his inner dweeb whenever he's around unrequited love Jamie. Ryan is really excellent with physical comedy. There are scenes with him that are just  uproarious (case in point, the aftermath of his politically incorrect hockey game with the kids). I even enjoyed his frequent Three Stooges encounters with his kid brother (Chris Marquette). And when he has to, Ryan steps outside the slapstick and layers in a deeper nuanced, more introspective performance. I ended up rooting for Chris, even though he was overly cocky and big-timed his home town folks. And then there's Amy Smart, who seemingly can do no wrong. There's just something so lovable and natural about her. She embodies the type of girl every guy would want to be with. Anna Faris's turn as the unstable Samantha adds to the already boisterous feel of the film. Samantha actually scares me. Chris Klein's Dusty, Chris's guitar-playing, song-writing rival, is disgustingly touchy-feely. One would wish that a different sort of arc for Dusty's character had been laid out; the script writer, in my eyes, sold out and made things too convenient for Chris, with regards to Dusty. Julie Hagerty (Airplane!) has a  goofy supporting role as Chris's mom.The special features are tasty:- a filmmakers' film commentary- ""Tales from the Friend Zone"" featurette (the cast & crew talk about real life ""just friends"" experiences)- ""Developing Just Friends"" featurette (wherein we learn of the script's 7 year odyssey and how, originally, Chris didn't get the girl at the end)- ""A Director's Guide to Comedy"" featurette- ""The Transformation"" featurette (about Ryan's fat face make-up)- ""The Body Shake"" featurette (the awkwardness of when you're dropping off a date; do you hug or kiss?)- ""It's Friggin' Cold"" featurette (the cast & crew basically complaining about how cold the shooting was)- ""A Writer's Journey"" featurette (focus on script writer Adam ""Tex"" Davis)- ""A Disaster in the Making"" featurette (about the making of the Palomino house X-mas decor and its eventual fate)- ""The Reshoots"" featurette (the making of the eventual ending of the film, which wasn't the original ending)- a so-so blooper reel- deleted scenes- an alternate ending (this was the initially intended ending; you could see why they changed it)- an amusing ""Jamie Smiles"" video- theatrical trailerSo, try out this movie.

969139,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000E6EHE0,Jason,"[7, 9]","""Just Friends"" is about truth.  It's about known, universal, guaranteed truths that bridge all boundaries in America.  Aside from the ending, which was completely and utterly ridiculous, the entire movie was factual.  Here's what I learned (already knew):1--It's proof of the Ladder Theory.  All women have two ladders.  One ladder is reserved for friends.  The other ladder is reserved for men she would potentially date and/or have sex with.  Once you are on the friend ladder, you can never move to the dating-love-sex ladder.2--The massage-trick is almost universally known.  Both men and women know that when a massage happens, and it is not performed by a licensed masseuse, there is more than likely some sex on the horizon.3--Dorks, dweebs, nerds, and geeks will never, I repeat, NEVER, get the popular hot chick...unless he's a rich dork.4--Every guy in high school that looked like Chris Klein was going to get the girl, and there was nothing anyone could do about it.  Added on to that is the fact that the same guy would inevitably treat the girl like a worthless whore, and he'd still keep getting the girls, despite the universal knowledge that he was a douche bag that would cheat on every girlfriend he had.5--It's much harder to *ahem* seal the deal, when it's a woman you like immensely.  Someone you are not interested in for anything other than the physical, well, that's a different story.6--Fat guys lip-synching will always be funny.7--It shows how shallow most women truly are.  Sure, everyone wants to act like men are the kings of the world of shallowness; but in reality, women charge the king rent.  She didn't want him when he was fat, but now that he's attractive and rich (the same as the C.Klein character), she practically throws herself at him.Other things to be aware of while watching the movie:1--This movie is proof that Amy Smart and Anna Farris are not the same person.  They are in a scene together, thereby dispelling the rumors.2--Most people who do everything considered nice, helpful, and philanthropic are probably doing all some of the activities with ulterior motives.  The world is not all rainbows and butterflies; deal with it.3--I'm sorry; but, in the real world, the ending of this movie will almost never happen.  Sure, it happens on Lifetime (when men aren't being blamed for everything wrong with the world), and it occasionally happens on an E-Harmony commercial (although I can't prove the veracity of any of the ads), but it almost never actually happens.",4,"Sorry ,but it's the truth: Fat dudes don't get the girl",1151193600,"06 25, 2006",2006,2514,"['Just', 'Friends', 'truth', 'known', 'universal', 'guaranteed', 'truths', 'bridge', 'boundaries', 'America', 'Aside', 'ending', 'was', 'completely', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'factual', 'Here', 'what', 'learned', 'already', 'knew', ':1', 'proof', 'Ladder', 'Theory', 'women', 'have', 'two', 'ladders', 'One', 'ladder', 'reserved', 'friends', 'other', 'ladder', 'reserved', 'men', 'would', 'potentially', 'date', 'and/or', 'have', 'sex', 'are', 'friend', 'ladder', 'can', 'never', 'move', 'dating-love-sex', 'ladder.2', 'massage-trick', 'almost', 'universally', 'known', 'men', 'women', 'know', 'when', 'massage', 'not', 'performed', 'licensed', 'masseuse', 'more', 'likely', 'sex', 'horizon.3', 'Dorks', 'dweebs', 'nerds', 'geeks', 'will', 'never', 'repeat', 'NEVER', 'get', 'popular', 'hot', 'chick', 'rich', 'dork.4', 'guy', 'high', 'school', 'looked', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'girl', 'was', 'nothing', 'anyone', 'could', 'do', 'Added', 'fact', 'same', 'guy', 'would', 'inevitably', 'treat', 'girl', 'worthless', 'whore', ""'d"", 'still', 'keep', 'getting', 'girls', 'universal', 'knowledge', 'was', 'douche', 'bag', 'would', 'cheat', 'girlfriend', 'much', 'harder', '*ahem*', 'seal', 'deal', 'when', 'woman', 'immensely', 'Someone', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'anything', 'other', 'physical', 'well', 'different', 'story.6', 'Fat', 'guys', 'lip-synching', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'funny.7', 'how', 'shallow', 'most', 'women', 'truly', 'are', 'Sure', 'everyone', 'act', 'men', 'are', 'kings', 'world', 'shallowness', 'reality', 'women', 'charge', 'king', 'rent', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'when', 'was', 'fat', 'now', 'attractive', 'rich', 'same', 'C.Klein', 'character', 'practically', 'him.Other', 'things', 'be', 'aware', 'watching', 'movie:1', 'movie', 'proof', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'Anna', 'Farris', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'person', 'are', 'scene', 'together', 'thereby', 'dispelling', 'rumors.2', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'everything', 'considered', 'nice', 'helpful', 'philanthropic', 'are', 'probably', 'doing', 'activities', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'world', 'not', 'rainbows', 'butterflies', 'deal', 'it.3', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'real', 'world', 'ending', 'movie', 'will', 'almost', 'never', 'happen', 'Sure', 'Lifetime', 'when', 'men', 'are', ""n't"", 'being', 'blamed', 'everything', 'wrong', 'world', 'occasionally', 'E-Harmony', 'commercial', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prove', 'veracity', 'ads', 'almost', 'never', 'actually']",N/A
969140,A2PIX2K56IZZYX,B000E6EHE0,Jason W. Kaiser,"[0, 0]","Oh the romantic comedy, how I generally loathe it. It is my least favorite genre and has been for the last ten years, so I'm usually pretty hesistant to watch them. But, as you know if you have read any of my reviews, I am a big Ryan Reynolds fan, and I was hoping, maybe, just maybe, he might restore my faith, even if a little, in the genre. And you know what? Big surprise, he did. Im my opinion, the man has not done a poor movie yet, and I know that they have not all been box office hits, but I don't put alot of faith into the box office, How 'bout you? As I already mentioned in the 'Waiting' Review, the man has a gift for comedy, be it physical or mental. Here he plays a cocky, womanizing, music executive, who ten years ago was a fat, shy, nerdy high school kid trying to tell his best friend Jamie (Amy Smart) that he loves her. Needless to say, it blows up in his face ending in public humiliation, so we cut to the present and found out he is representing Samantha James (Anna Faris, priceless) the new 'It' girl in the music scene. She is truly awful and can't sing a lick, but she thinks Chris (Reynolds) loves her so they go to Paris to try and promote her.The chemistry between Faris and Reynolds is amazing, they just worked together brilliantly in 'Waiting' and here they are doing it again, except even better this time. There are many a scene where you will find yourself constanly laughing out loud and just having a really good time. Nether have to try to hard as they are just so natural together and play off each other perfectly. I'm a little sad that I just saw Anna Faris will be starring in Scary Movie 4, I was hoping she was done with that crap after seeing 'Waiting' and now 'Just Friends' but I guess the lure of the paycheck is tooooo strong.Amy Smart is average as Jamie, she has a few funny moments here and there with Reynolds, but lacks the spark of the Farris and Reynolds magic. It seems Chris still loves her and must now compete with an old Jamie admirer named Dusty, played perfectly by Chris Klein. He puts up the sensitive guy with a guitar front, but is actually a real bastard just out to try and nail Jamie to get her back for dissing him back in high school. Klein and Reynolds also have some genuine funny moments that I think most will get a kick out of.Anyone remember a comic gem back in the early 80's called Airplane? Do you remember Julie Hagerty who played Elaine, the stewardess who saves the day with a bobby pin? She plays Chris's mom and is wonderfull, very funny as a ditsy, clueless mom who just wants whats best for her son. She is just as funny now as she was back then. Also, the kid who plays Chris's brother Mike is really good too, they are several scenes where they are beating the hell out of each other then to turn around and exchange hugs. Mike also gets to chaufer Samantha around, and accidentally hits her with a stun gun that messes her up a bit so  Chris comes home to her eating toothpaste with a giant ice-pack on her head, great stuff here.So, not the strongest plot around, but with a romantic comedy, who really cares, I really like the fact that they focused more on the comedy and less on the romance, I think that saved this from what could have been just another boring, brain-dead romantic comedy. I just gotta give it up again for Ryan Reynolds, this guy has so much going for him, and although the ladies will be disappointed because the famous Reynolds ab's are not shown, I really hope he doesn't fade away by picking lame projects in the future. Also, please stick around and watch the credits, he lip-sync's the song 'I Swear' and it's not to be missed. Be sure and check out the gag reel and the deleted scenes as well, extremely funny and actually a couple of scenes that will have you wondering why they didn't leave them in the movie.

I think this role worked for him because he had to play a likable character and while many will say he always plays a likable character I say that he always plays the same sarcastic cool guy character. This role allowed him to still be his normal character for some part but also a likable character as well. Mr. Reynolds has finally gotten out of his box and played a role that wasn't tailor made for him.As for the rest of the cast, Amy Smart was also very likable as the best friend Jamie. She was honestly a very sweet and caring person and you really wanted her to date Chris at least in the beginning. Anna Faris who again plays the same character in every movie did play her ""typical"" airhead role. But she played a stereotypical brainless pop star and played it perfectly. I found her whole performance hilarious. She basically played Jessica Simpson in the movie and there are a few jokes that really imply that's who they were mocking.""Just Friends"" is a guilty pleasure film. Even though it didn't do so well at the box office or be liked by everyone (most critics gave it rather poor reviews) but I don't think it was a film created for critics but a specific limited audience. And while the film's marketing makes this film look like a typical teen movie, I feel it's a bit more mature than that even though some of the characters in the film are almost childlike.Overall ""Just Friends"" shows how important it is to be yourself and act mature. It is also proof that Ryan Reynolds can play a different character and is actually good at it. As long as you don't go into the theater expecting a film that is original and thought-provoking you should be fine because this movie is a decent holiday romantic comedy that both guys and girls alike can enjoy.",3,"A good movie to see with that person that you're trying to get out of the ""friend's zone""",1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,1839,"['must', 'say', 'time', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'stared', 'decent', 'movie', 'think', 'role', 'worked', 'had', 'play', 'likable', 'character', 'many', 'will', 'say', 'always', 'likable', 'character', 'say', 'always', 'same', 'sarcastic', 'cool', 'guy', 'character', 'role', 'allowed', 'still', 'be', 'normal', 'character', 'part', 'also', 'likable', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'Mr.', 'Reynolds', 'finally', 'gotten', 'out', 'box', 'played', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'tailor', 'made', 'him.As', 'rest', 'cast', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'likable', 'best', 'friend', 'Jamie', 'was', 'honestly', 'very', 'sweet', 'caring', 'person', 'really', 'wanted', 'date', 'Chris', 'least', 'beginning', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'who', 'again', 'same', 'character', 'movie', 'did', 'play', 'typical', 'airhead', 'role', 'played', 'stereotypical', 'brainless', 'pop', 'star', 'played', 'perfectly', 'found', 'whole', 'performance', 'hilarious', 'basically', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'jokes', 'really', 'imply', 'who', 'were', 'mocking', 'Just', 'Friends', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'film', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'be', 'liked', 'everyone', 'most', 'critics', 'gave', 'rather', 'poor', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'film', 'created', 'critics', 'specific', 'limited', 'audience', 'film', 'marketing', 'film', 'look', 'typical', 'teen', 'movie', 'feel', 'bit', 'more', 'mature', 'even', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'almost', 'childlike.Overall', 'Just', 'Friends', 'how', 'important', 'be', 'act', 'mature', 'also', 'proof', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'can', 'play', 'different', 'character', 'actually', 'good', 'As', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'theater', 'expecting', 'film', 'original', 'thought-provoking', 'should', 'be', 'fine', 'movie', 'decent', 'holiday', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'guys', 'girls', 'alike', 'can', 'enjoy']",N/A

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","Before I go too far in my review of ""Just Friends,"" let me first state that I'm not an entirely huge fan of Ryan Reynolds.  I've always felt that he was funny at first, but his wisecracking, smart alecky persona has worn thing with time.  In this flick, however, Reynolds lightens up on the quips and actually  plays a full-on geek with image issues who gets embarassed in front of the entire senior class and vows to become something better than the rest of them.  He does, but he makes it big knowing that his best friend, played by Amy Smart, never truly knew how he felt about her.He becomes a big-time record producer and while courting his ex-girlfriend(Anna Faris) in an attempt to get her to sign with his label, they become stuck in his hometown in New Jersey.  While waiting for the plane and the weather, Reynolds attempts to reconnect with his old best friend and let her know how he really feels.  The only thing standing in his way is his very suspicious ex and one-time fellow geek Chris Klein, who's become a very good songwriter and all-around nice guy.What follows is a collage of comedic situations including Reynolds playing hockey with some kiddies, Klein completely snowballing Smart, her friends, and family and Reynolds' little brother's attempts to keep Faris out of the way.  In fact, the little brother (Christopher Marquette) and Faris almost steal the show from Reynolds and Smart.  Faris is basically a prettier, better singing version of Ashlee Simpson.  She's obnoxious, completely oblivious, and thinks that she's the greatest artist of all time.This flick is not one of the top comedies around.  It is refreshing, however, to see Reynolds actually playing a character who isn't a total smart-you-know-what.  I'd consider it a rental for most folks, especially if you enjoy comedies like ""Fever Pitch"" and ""The Sweetest Thing.""",3,"Likeable, Light  Comedy",1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,1860,"['go', 'too', 'far', 'review', 'Just', 'Friends', 'let', 'first', 'state', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'huge', 'fan', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'funny', 'first', 'wisecracking', 'smart', 'alecky', 'persona', 'worn', 'thing', 'time', 'flick', 'however', 'Reynolds', 'up', 'quips', 'actually', 'full-on', 'geek', 'image', 'issues', 'who', 'embarassed', 'front', 'entire', 'senior', 'class', 'become', 'something', 'better', 'rest', 'big', 'knowing', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'never', 'truly', 'knew', 'how', 'felt', 'her.He', 'big-time', 'record', 'producer', 'courting', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'attempt', 'get', 'sign', 'label', 'become', 'stuck', 'hometown', 'New', 'Jersey', 'waiting', 'plane', 'weather', 'Reynolds', 'reconnect', 'old', 'best', 'friend', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'really', 'only', 'thing', 'standing', 'way', 'very', 'suspicious', 'ex', 'one-time', 'fellow', 'geek', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'who', 'become', 'very', 'good', 'songwriter', 'all-around', 'nice', 'guy.What', 'collage', 'comedic', 'situations', 'including', 'Reynolds', 'playing', 'hockey', 'kiddies', 'Klein', 'completely', 'snowballing', 'Smart', 'friends', 'family', 'Reynolds', 'little', 'brother', 'attempts', 'keep', 'Faris', 'way', 'fact', 'little', 'brother', 'Christopher', 'Marquette', 'Faris', 'almost', 'steal', 'show', 'Reynolds', 'Smart', 'Faris', 'basically', 'prettier', 'better', 'singing', 'version', 'Ashlee', 'Simpson', 'obnoxious', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'greatest', 'artist', 'time.This', 'flick', 'not', 'one', 'top', 'comedies', 'refreshing', 'however', 'see', 'Reynolds', 'actually', 'playing', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'total', 'smart-you-know-what', ""'d"", 'consider', 'rental', 'most', 'folks', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'comedies', 'Fever', 'Pitch', 'Sweetest', 'Thing']",N/A

969162,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000E6EHE0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 2]","""Just Friends"" should be a movie that speaks to me.  No, I did not weigh 350 pounds in high school (actually, when I graduated it was at about one-third of that weight), but the prologue of this 2005 comedy has Chris Brander (Ryan Reynolds) getting ready to finally tell his friend Jamie Palamino (Amy Smart), that he has loved her from fairly close up for years (they are cheerleaders together) and that he wants to be more than just friends.  Of course, this moment of desperate hope becomes one of intense public humiliations and the motivation for Chris' transition in to the lady killer we meet ten years later.  Now, I did not get that far, but I do recall it taking two phone calls and three hours of avoiding the subject to finally get up enough nerve to ask the girl of my dreams to our high school prom when we were seniors.  Good news: she said yes.  Bad news: we went out to dinner with two other couples and she ending up marrying one of the other guys.  They were dating by graduation.  So I feel Chris' pain and the thought that the inherent irony of the title assures us that this will not be the case by the end of the film should give my heart reason to rise.But things just do not get that far off the ground.  Now that Chris can have any woman he wants he apparently takes great pleasure in having them and then leaving them.  He is working in the music business and his punishment for his bad behavior is Samantha James (Anna Faris), a bratty young singer.  He wants to sign her to his label and she wants to make out, which means he has gotten himself tangled up in what I call a sticky situation.  However, the Fates have something else in mind for Chris when one of Samantha's mishaps gets them stranded in New Jersey, not far from where his family lives.  So for the first time in about a decade Chris is hope and looking good, when who do you think he runs into, but Jamie.This movie from director Roger Kumble (""The Sweetest Thing"") and writer Adam ""Tex"" Davis (""Spring Break Lawyer"") then proceeds to put Chris through a series of bad jokes.  He might be hot stuff in Hollywood, but back home in seems like nothing has ever changed.  Certainly he can no more tell Jamie his feelings than he could ten years earlier (actually, he could not tell her then: he could only write them in her yearbook and end up with somebody else reading them, out loud, to everybody).  But his is his opportunity to finally take Jamie on a date, even if it is during the day time, provided that he can have his brother Mike (as Christopher Marquette) distract Samantha, although actually not getting her killed should be higher on the agenda.  It seems like Jamie is interested in seeing Chris, but I keep getting the feeling it is not because she has had second thoughts about their relationship or because he now looks good, but rather because she has read the entire script and she knows where this movie is going to end up in the last act.  I have found both Reynolds and Smart to be engaging in the past, but that is certainly not the case here.On the one hand, it is certainly sad to see that Chris is still getting the short end of the stick despite how he has improved himself, but on the other the way he treats women makes me think he probably deserves to have Samantha make his life a living hell more than he deserves to end up with Jamie.  In fact, Chris and Jamie have so many missed opportunities that Samantha ends up being the most interesting character in the film.  The movie hits a little close to home for me when Chris gets hurt and Jamie gets interested in Dusty (Chris Klein), a paramedic who was another loser in high school, but who has also cleaned up well and finally finished that song he was writing about her.I kept thinking that there was some sort of larger point to all this, but I cannot come up with anything worthwhile.  This does not really matter because if we cared about Chris five minutes into the movie we were given good reason to stop caring five minutes later, and nothing other than the fact that their names appear at the top of the credits gives us any reason to really care about the two love interests.  We know what motivates him, but there is really no clue about her and her actions would speak against her character except for the fact that she is a fictional creation who words and actions were written by somebody else.  If you are going to mine the pain of our youth for cinematic reasons, then at least come up with something worthy of our agonies.",2,Not much funny here from the premise to the way it plays out,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,4514,"['Just', 'Friends', 'should', 'be', 'movie', 'No', 'did', 'not', 'weigh', '350', 'pounds', 'high', 'school', 'actually', 'when', 'graduated', 'was', 'one-third', 'weight', 'prologue', '2005', 'comedy', 'Chris', 'Brander', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'getting', 'ready', 'finally', 'tell', 'friend', 'Jamie', 'Palamino', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'loved', 'fairly', 'close', 'up', 'years', 'are', 'cheerleaders', 'together', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'friends', 'course', 'moment', 'desperate', 'hope', 'one', 'intense', 'public', 'humiliations', 'motivation', 'Chris', 'transition', 'lady', 'killer', 'meet', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Now', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'far', 'do', 'recall', 'taking', 'two', 'phone', 'calls', 'three', 'hours', 'avoiding', 'subject', 'finally', 'get', 'up', 'enough', 'nerve', 'ask', 'girl', 'dreams', 'high', 'school', 'prom', 'when', 'were', 'seniors', 'Good', 'news', 'said', 'yes', 'Bad', 'news', 'went', 'out', 'dinner', 'two', 'other', 'couples', 'ending', 'up', 'marrying', 'one', 'other', 'guys', 'were', 'dating', 'graduation', 'feel', 'Chris', 'pain', 'thought', 'inherent', 'irony', 'title', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'end', 'film', 'should', 'give', 'heart', 'reason', 'rise.But', 'things', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'far', 'ground', 'Now', 'Chris', 'can', 'have', 'woman', 'apparently', 'great', 'pleasure', 'having', 'then', 'leaving', 'working', 'music', 'business', 'punishment', 'bad', 'behavior', 'Samantha', 'James', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'bratty', 'young', 'singer', 'sign', 'label', 'make', 'out', 'gotten', 'tangled', 'up', 'what', 'call', 'sticky', 'situation', 'However', 'Fates', 'have', 'something', 'else', 'mind', 'Chris', 'when', 'one', 'Samantha', 'mishaps', 'stranded', 'New', 'Jersey', 'not', 'far', 'where', 'family', 'So', 'first', 'time', 'decade', 'Chris', 'hope', 'looking', 'good', 'when', 'who', 'do', 'think', 'Jamie.This', 'movie', 'director', 'Roger', 'Kumble', 'Sweetest', 'Thing', 'Adam', 'Tex', 'Davis', 'Spring', 'Break', 'Lawyer', 'then', 'put', 'Chris', 'series', 'bad', 'jokes', 'might', 'be', 'hot', 'stuff', 'Hollywood', 'back', 'home', 'nothing', 'ever', 'changed', 'Certainly', 'can', 'no', 'more', 'tell', 'Jamie', 'feelings', 'could', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'actually', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'then', 'could', 'only', 'write', 'yearbook', 'end', 'up', 'somebody', 'else', 'reading', 'loud', 'everybody', 'opportunity', 'finally', 'take', 'Jamie', 'date', 'even', 'day', 'time', 'provided', 'can', 'have', 'brother', 'Mike', 'Christopher', 'Marquette', 'distract', 'Samantha', 'actually', 'not', 'getting', 'killed', 'should', 'be', 'higher', 'agenda', 'Jamie', 'interested', 'seeing', 'Chris', 'keep', 'getting', 'feeling', 'not', 'had', 'second', 'thoughts', 'relationship', 'now', 'good', 'rather', 'read', 'entire', 'script', 'where', 'movie', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'last', 'act', 'have', 'found', 'Reynolds', 'Smart', 'be', 'engaging', 'past', 'certainly', 'not', 'case', 'here.On', 'one', 'hand', 'certainly', 'sad', 'see', 'Chris', 'still', 'getting', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'how', 'improved', 'other', 'way', 'women', 'think', 'probably', 'have', 'Samantha', 'make', 'life', 'living', 'hell', 'more', 'end', 'up', 'Jamie', 'fact', 'Chris', 'Jamie', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'Samantha', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'film', 'movie', 'little', 'close', 'home', 'when', 'Chris', 'hurt', 'Jamie', 'interested', 'Dusty', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'paramedic', 'who', 'was', 'loser', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'also', 'cleaned', 'up', 'well', 'finally', 'finished', 'song', 'was', 'writing', 'her.I', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'sort', 'larger', 'point', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'not', 'really', 'matter', 'cared', 'Chris', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'were', 'given', 'good', 'reason', 'stop', 'caring', 'five', 'minutes', 'later', 'nothing', 'other', 'fact', 'names', 'appear', 'top', 'credits', 'reason', 'really', 'care', 'two', 'love', 'interests', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'clue', 'actions', 'would', 'speak', 'character', 'fact', 'fictional', 'creation', 'who', 'words', 'actions', 'were', 'written', 'somebody', 'else', 'are', 'going', 'mine', 'pain', 'youth', 'cinematic', 'reasons', 'then', 'least', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'worthy', 'agonies']",N/A

969166,A1J6B00Z1D6PS4,B000E6EHE0,"Livin' La Vida Low-Carb Man ""Jimmy Moore""","[0, 4]","My wife Christine and I love to watch movies together and we try to do so at least once a week either at the theater or by watching one from our DVD collection which numbers in the hundreds now. We absolutely love pulling out a movie and getting transported into the fantasy worlds they take us to when we need a break from the real world.Last year, a new movie entitled ""Just Friends"" starring Ryan Reynolds and Amy Smart was being advertised in the theaters and I was immediately drawn to it because the main character was an obese person in high school who came back home ten years later after losing a whole lotta weight. Naturally this theme appeals to me since I have lost a lot of weight since high school as well and I can't wait for my 20-year high school reunion in 2009.I previously blogged about this movie at my LivinLaVidaLowCarb.com blog about this theme of Hollywood trying to reach the obese with movies like this. Perhaps the hope that someone who was obese in high school could actually have an opportunity to connect with an old crush is compelling enough for people to follow, although the reality of the situation is that it would probably never happen. Who really knows?Last night on my ""date night"" with my wife Christine, we were FINALLY able to see this movie for the very first time. I will not bore you with the plot details and you can read about them in the Amazon listing above. However, it is a rather simple premise: boy is fat, is the friend of a beautiful girl, wants to be more than that, runs away in an embarrassing tizzy when his real feelings come out, loses a lot of weight, comes back to win the love of the woman he always wanted. That's the movie plot in a nutshell.I was looking forward to the movie despite the fact that I was sure it would offer the typical fat cliches. And it did. Dorky fat person hangs out with nerd-type friends and allows the jock-types to push them around. Yadda yadda yadda. We've seen and heard all of this so many times before it really has gotten old (especially since most of these stereotypes are not true!).We've seen it all before, but there were some intriguing twists to this movie that were sometimes strange, sometimes surprising to me because of how out-of-place they seemed in a movie like this. Before you go contacting me using the ""it's only a movie"" argument against me, I know, I KNOW. But I can't help but ask some very obvious questions about the details in this movie that I think make it difficult to swallow at times, despite the fact that I enjoyed watching it.1. How realistic is it that ""the hottest girl in school"" would hang out and be friends with ""the fattest guy in school?""This caught my attention right away at the beginning of the movie. Here is the girl that every guy in school wishes he could be with and she's best friends with the fat guy. Say what?! When has this EVER happened? The Jamie Palamino character is seen bouncing up and down on her bed excited about graduation while alone with the obese guy Chris Bender who secretly has a crush on her and desperately wants to tell her how he really feels. Only in a movie would a man that size ever have the opporutnity to get that close to a girl like that in high school. Maybe I'm wrong about this, but I don't see the captain of the cheerleading squad embracing as a friend someone who is essentially an outcast by the rest of the school no matter how ""sensitive"" he is. She would be ribbed and ridiculed way too much by her ""cool"" friends to ever keep that relationship alive. Am I right? It could possibly happen, but most likely it would not.2. Why isn't ""the hottest girl in school"" married already ten years after high school?Okay, this was also puzzling to me. Here is this beautiful girl who for all intents and purposes could choose whoever she wants to be with (although she made some poor choices in high school according to the storyline) and she isn't married or even dating anyone? In the real world, that would be pretty far-fetched to me. Although several suitors line up in the movie in an attempt to woo her, I still find it hard to believe that at the age of 28 or so she would not have already walked the aisle and gotten married. They never really developed her character enough to find out WHY she wasn't married yet, although at the end of the movie she says her dream over the next ten years was to get married and have kids. Guess who she ended up with? No big surprise there. :)3. Why are fat people always portrayed as so gay-sounding and looking?While I am sure he was simply following the directions of his director, I was completely turned off by how Ryan Reynolds portrayed Chris Brander when he was in the fat suit. The slightly-slurred speech and elongated ends of words made him sound so freakin' gay. What's up with that? Even when I weighed 410 pounds, I was NEVER even remotely gay. Yes, it is possible for a fat man to be a manly man, believe it or not!Even worse was the fact that they made the Chris Brander character a CHEERLEADER with his best friend Jamie, aka ""the hottest girl in school."" What fat person, man or woman, do you EVER remember being a cheerleader in high school? Anyone? ANYONE? That's right, THEY WEREN'T! That was so crazy to see him jumping up and down in a cheerleader outfit!While we're on how fat people are portrayed in this movie, what's up with being pushed over by jocks? I was bigger than most of the athletes in high school, so they really never messed with me based on my size. Sure I got teased, but I don't think any of them would have ever just pushed me away in the middle of a conversation with someone like the Chris Brander character was. They probably couldn't do that since I weighed so much!Finally, all former fat people who have lost weight haven't become cynical about how people treated them in the past. I admit it is has been hard to see some people treat me differently now that I am not obese anymore, but for the most part I am the same man I was nearly 200 pounds ago and feel no grudges towards anyone. We're not all out to seek revenge on the world!4. Did the Chris Brander character lose weight by livin' la vida low-carb?This was another interesting thing about this movie that should be an attractive draw for people who are following a low-carb lifestyle. While they never explicitly say HOW the Chris Brander character lost weight, we get some clues from the movie. During one scene with his old high school crush while sitting in the diner they always went to ten years previously, the waitress brings out ""the usual"" order that both of them always had to eat. For her it was a grilled cheese sandwich and French fries and for him it was chocolate chip pancakes piled about six high! Yikes!He took one look at that plate of pancakes and said, ""I can't eat that, I haven't had sugar in ten years."" The girl gets mad and says she will eat them and he can have her grilled cheese and fries instead. He politely declines and says he will enjoy his glass of water. Hmmm, no sugar, no pancakes, no bread, no fries, with water -- sounds like livin' la vida low-carb to me!One more comment: While I thought it was insensitive of the Jamie character to get mad that he wouldn't eat the pancakes, it just goes to show that skinny people don't know how hard it is to keep the weight off for the rest of your life after you've been obese at some point. You can NEVER let your guard down and fall back into old habits again. NEVER!!!5. Do famous people secretly lower their intake of carbs to stay thin?One of the funniest parts of ""Just Friends"" was the airhead, Jessica Simpson-like character played by Anna Faris. She was a riot to watch and provided some extra comic relief throughout the movie to keep it, well, interesting to say the least. One point in the movie she is offered some potato chips and other snacks to satisfy her hunger and she exclaims, ""I can't have those, they have too many carbs!"" Hey, hey, hey, what do you know? She's shunning carbs ostensiblity because overconsuming them can lead to weight gain which would be bad for her image. WOW, how about that? It makes you wonder how many real-life pop divas and entertainment stars keep their weight managed watching their carbs? Hmmmm? I bet it's a bunch although they'd never admit to being on the Atkins diet or on low-carb.All in all, I would have to say that ""Just Friends"" was just delightful and would make for an excellent movie for you to watch.

A flight to Paris is interrupted by engine trouble and Chris finds himself home in Jersey for the holidays. One run in with his lost love and 10 years of forgetting fall away.

969174,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000E6EHE0,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[5, 7]","Director Roger Kumble can't stop thinking about relationships.  First he gives us Cruel Intentions 1 & 2, then the Sweetest Thing, and now we have Just Friends, another movie about relationships gone awry.  If the first two films were about manipulating people for sex and the second was about manipulating them for love, this latest flick could be safely called a little of both.Penned by Adam ""Tex"" Davis (this is the first thing he's written for the screen, unless you count the Made-For-TV ""Spring Break Lawyer,"" which, uh, I don't), ""Just Friends"" is certainly having fun with itself, but it doesn't always have fun with the audience.  Poor Chris, a fat-but-loveable high school loser, professes his love for his best friend, Jamie, only to have her turn him down with a platonic kiss, planted firmly in that ""like a brother"" area located in the middle of his chubby cheek.  Ten years later, Chris has slimed down and toned up and now pursues and discards women with a personality that is as chiseled as his body.  Working as a sly music executive, he finds himself accidentally stranded in his native New Jersey (thanks to a jet plane/microwave mishap) with another chance to win the heart (or at least the body) of his long-lost childhood chum.Chris is played expertly by Ryan Reynolds doing what he does best: mixing wry attitude with well-acted emotion (his best scenes are when he's encased in rubber as the once-flabby Chris; Reynolds would do well to take more character roles, since he's starting to pigeonhole himself as The Witty Wiseacre).  Reynolds is surrounded by a group of equally able co-stars who are strong in each of their roles: Amy Smart as the trophy gal, Jamie; the wonderfully over-the-top Anna Faris as a Christina Aguilera wanna-be named Samantha James; and Chris Klein (who seems to be making fun of every other dull-as-dirt character he's ever played) as the doe-eyed rival, Dusty Dinkleman.  There are other notables here, too, including Stephen Root (Newsradio, Dodgeball) as Chris's boss and Julie Hagerty (Airplane!) as Chris's ditzy mother.Ms. Hagerty's presence makes a lot of sense, especially since this film borrows heavily from a lot of its comedic ancestors, which not only include Zucker and Abrahams, but also the Three Stooges (see: Chris's slap-heavy relationship with his younger brother -- the only thing that's missing there are ""nyuks"" and eye pokes) and the National Lampoon's series (see: the various pratfalls and even a humorously obliterated Christmas panorama).A lot of this is remarkably well done and truly funny stuff (for those fans of the style), but it also seems crammed together in a clumsy attempt to distract from the shallow and confused script.  You don't ask much from a movie like this, but you do expect a little heart, a little warmth, or -- more importantly -- a little sense.  Unfortunately, not much of this movie seems very relatable or plausible, which wouldn't be so bad if the film didn't pretend so hard that it was both.  As a result, Chris's pursuit of Jamie, although it is the main premise, actually feels tacked on, and both characters, in spite of their believability as real people, are still very hard to understand and connect with.Your best bet, if you watch this film, is just to watch it.  People get electrocuted, dropped off balconies, and very few groins are spared.  Reynolds hams it up, mugs with panache, and takes all of the abuse with classy straight-man style.  Even the final credits roll over a souped-up version of Samantha James' song, ""Forgiveness,"" a pretty funny send-up of bubble-gum pop (""To forgive is divine/so let's have a glass of wine/and have make-up sex/until the end of time"").  Ultimately, if you can remove yourself from the movie as much as it removes itself from you, you'll probably enjoy the experience.(This DVD comes with the usual voice-over commentary -- which is actually pretty banal considering the subject matter, some deleted scenes, a lot of stuff about the making-of -- including Ryan's transformation into a fat high school kid, a set of blooper clips -- always a favorite, and an alternate ending that is obviously alternate for a reason.  A good collection for those of you who like a lot of bonus material.

He's not attractive. Maybe he wears glasses, or has a bad complexion, or hair, or just plain fat. But he has a personality and the object of his affection, likes to be around him. He makes her laugh, makes her feel good and he likes to make her feel good. Maybe if he keeps making her feel good, she will eventually return the love he feels for her. Unfortunately for him, it's not in the cards, for you see, in her mind, he is asexual, they are Just Friends.Just FriendsOur hero, Chris Bander (Ryan Reynolds) is in love with Jamie Palimino (Amy Smart). It seems he has always been in love with her, however Jamie has never thought of her longtime, overweight buddy in terms of love. It never enters her mind. After all they are Just Friends.Everyone who has ever attended school knows that classmates, even friends can be brutal. One night at a senior high school party, one of Chris's popular fair weather friends, gets hold of a love letter meant for Jamie and reads it out loud to the party members, terribly embarrassing Chris. Totally humiliated, Chris lashes out saying he will never let this happen again.Fast forward a few years. A leaner and meaner (easy Tom) Chris now resides in Los Angeles and has become the right hand man of a big Hollywood producer and is in a position to take advantage of the fringe benefits. It seems, the now ice hearted, Chris Bander has become a ladies man. Not just a ladies man but a love 'em and leave 'em, serial musical bed partner, hedonist.Things are going peachy for our hardened confirmed bachelor, when providence steps in. Chris is ordered to wine and dine and woo, if necessary the ditzy, neurotic Samantha James (Anna Farris) a fast rising recording star who Chris' boss is trying to sign. Samantha, whom Chris had about a year previous and discarded after one tryst, was taken with Chris (ho hum, aren`t they all) and is overjoyed that he has returned to her life and to celebrate, insists they visit Paris. Chris is stuck, so it's off to Paris in Samantha's private jet.The flight to Paris is interrupted and they are forced to land, when Samantha stared a fire in an on board microwave oven. The emergency landing took place in Trenton N.J. of all places, Chris' home town, leading to a renewal of old friendships and some hilarious situations as Chris tries to renew his affection, which to his chagrin have never left, with Jamie Palimino while sloughing off Samantha on his more than willing, younger brother Mike. (Chris Marquette)Directed by Roger KumbleCast/ CharactersRyan Reynolds .... Chris BranderAmy Smart .... Jamie PalaminoAnna Farris .... Samantha JamesChris Klein .... DustyChria Marquette .... MikeJulie Haggerty .... Chris' MomConclusionFirst of all, I'm not a big comedy fan and I'm especially not a fan of chick flicks. This is not a movie that I would see in a theater but would normally wait for video. Seeing the movie was necessitated by our extemporaneous decision to see a movie and Just Friends being the only movie that was starting within fifty minutes.Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was well done. The story, while not overly imaginative, was `cute' and the directing seemed very professional. The cast was well chosen and the acting was excellent. I really got a kick out of Samantha James' character, played by Anna Farris. I don't remember seeing her before but I understand she was in that snooze film, Lost in Translation. Perhaps I snoozed through her part. Anna Farris was the hit of Just Friends as far as I was concerned and sexy too. Just Friends is definitely worth seeing.

969188,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B000E6EHE0,Nicholas Carroll,"[2, 5]","I watched this film expecting a sweet comedy along the lines of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin""...as a once-obese high school outcast Chris (Ryan Reynolds) finally gets the girl of his dreams, Jamie. The film starts out in the past (1995) at a graduation party at Miss Popularity's house where Chris is shamefully ridiculed by his entire graduating class. He runs away and vows to make something of his life.Cut to 10 years later. Chris is a svelte, smooth record exec who uses women and disposes them after he gets what he couldn't get in high school. I kept thinking what a shallow cad he became. It's fine to improve your life (lose weight, gain confidence, pursue career goals), but that doesn't mean one has to lose his soul in the process. Anyhow, that's how they wanted to make the character. For some strange reason, he hasn't been to his hometown in New Jersey in ten years. By inexplicable logic, he gets stranded in his hometown on his way to Paris in a private jet with a former flame (the outrageous Anna Faris doing a combo-Britney Spears/Jessica Simpson). He connects with old friends, spots his dream girl working in a bar, and sees his former tormentor looking very much like a loser. So, this sets the stage to show off to his unrequited love that he's a changed man.What ensues is a series of outlandish scenes that come across as very unrealistic, growing more and more unbelievable until the end, when it loses all credibility. While some of the scenes would be fine in a satire or spoof a la ""Date Movie"", this one sold itself as a ""romantic comedy"". After watching it, I felt that the makers insulted any movie goer with a brain. To make the movie funny, they went for outrageous, but it doesn't work. No wonder the film bombed at the box office. It could have been a great film. The premise is a good one (high school outcast changes into a better man and wins over the love his life), but the delivery simply sucks.

Schell,"[2, 2]","A romantic comedy with a modest budget, the box office for ""Just Friends"" surpassed expectations when it grossed a surprising $32.5 million domestically and that is no doubt due to its star talent.  With Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris and Chris Klein headlining the cast, people going into ""Just Friends"" will get laughs aplenty with room to spare for a few genuinely touching moments.Chris Brander (Reynolds) is a lovable teenaged dweeb - shy, overweight and head-over-heels in love with his best friend Jamie Palamino (Smart), a girl from the popular crowd.  No longer able to bottle his feelings, he confesses his love but gets the rejection he feared while being mortified in the process.  Deciding that he will no longer be a suffering fool, he retreats on his bicycle, determined to make something of himself.Fast forward ten years and Chris is several pounds lighter, a successful record producer in Los Angeles and a real ladies' man who has broken more hearts than can be counted.  Though he lives the life of which every bachelor dreams, Chris's unrequited love has made him a cynic and a womanizer.  His just-desserts for his chauvinistic behavior come in the form of rising pop star and manic ex-girlfriend Samantha James (Faris), a singer that he is ordered to recruit for the record label for which he works.  Jumping his bones the moment she sees him, Samantha suggests an impromptu trip to Paris but by a strange twist of fate they end up in Chris's home state of New Jersey and he decides to visit his family for the holidays.While trying to keep the psychotic and high-maintenance Samantha occupied, Chris looks up Jamie and much to his delight, she is still beautiful and still single.  Resentful for having been kept in the ""friend zone"" all those years, he hatches a grand plan to take advantage of her but he doesn't count on falling in love with her all over again.He also doesn't count on some fierce competition in the form of Dusty Dinkleman (Klein), another shy and stuttering nerd who was also infatuated with Jamie.  Now a confident and handsome part-time EMT who is positively enchanting on the guitar, Dusty pulls out all the stops to win her over and in the process reveals that he doesn't have the best intentions.  A farcical war develops between the two men, one that has both of them cleverly disguising their own agendas while fighting the urge to expose the other (lest they expose themselves in the process).Though an inexperienced screenwriter, Adam ""Tex"" David's screenplay gets many laughs from its even-handed sarcasm and slapstick as well as the superb execution of the film's skilled comedic actors.  Ryan Reynolds is no stranger to comedies - with the starring role in 2004's ""Van Wilder"" as well as the portrayal of another womanizer in 2005's ""Waiting"" (also opposite Anna Faris), his delivery and facial expression are dynamite.  Klein, another comedic film veteran (Election, American Pie), impresses with his ability to cut loose and be absolutely insane as Dusty, a man whose ulterior motives become all too clear towards the end.Both of them are almost overshadowed by Anna Faris, a comedic actress made famous by her starring role in the Wayans brothers' ""Scary Movie"" trilogy.  Faris is insanely funny as Samantha James, a ditzy and petulant celebrity who is sickly sweet one moment, horny another and then flying off the handle the next.Amy Smart tends to play the straight role in comedies whilst everyone else has all the fun and she does it again here as Jamie; despite being the only serious performance in the movie, she still holds her own next to Reynolds and Faris.Bottom line: Replete with an even mix of physical comedy as well as a good dose of wry humor, ""Just Friends"" will procure many chuckles from its keen writing, direction and performances.",4,Just Laughs...And More Laughs,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,3810,"['romantic', 'comedy', 'modest', 'budget', 'box', 'office', 'Just', 'Friends', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'when', 'grossed', 'surprising', '32.5', 'million', 'domestically', 'doubt', 'due', 'star', 'talent', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'headlining', 'cast', 'people', 'going', 'Just', 'Friends', 'will', 'get', 'laughs', 'aplenty', 'room', 'spare', 'few', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'moments.Chris', 'Brander', 'Reynolds', 'lovable', 'teenaged', 'dweeb', 'shy', 'overweight', 'head-over-heels', 'love', 'best', 'friend', 'Jamie', 'Palamino', 'Smart', 'girl', 'popular', 'crowd', 'No', 'longer', 'able', 'bottle', 'feelings', 'love', 'rejection', 'feared', 'being', 'mortified', 'process', 'Deciding', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'suffering', 'fool', 'bicycle', 'determined', 'make', 'something', 'himself.Fast', 'forward', 'ten', 'years', 'Chris', 'several', 'pounds', 'lighter', 'successful', 'record', 'producer', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'real', 'ladies', 'man', 'who', 'broken', 'more', 'hearts', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'life', 'bachelor', 'dreams', 'Chris', 'unrequited', 'love', 'made', 'cynic', 'womanizer', 'just-desserts', 'chauvinistic', 'behavior', 'come', 'form', 'rising', 'pop', 'star', 'manic', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Samantha', 'James', 'Faris', 'singer', 'ordered', 'recruit', 'record', 'label', 'Jumping', 'bones', 'moment', 'Samantha', 'impromptu', 'trip', 'Paris', 'strange', 'twist', 'fate', 'end', 'up', 'Chris', 'home', 'state', 'New', 'Jersey', 'visit', 'family', 'holidays.While', 'trying', 'keep', 'psychotic', 'high-maintenance', 'Samantha', 'occupied', 'Chris', 'up', 'Jamie', 'much', 'delight', 'still', 'beautiful', 'still', 'single', 'Resentful', 'having', 'been', 'kept', 'friend', 'zone', 'years', 'grand', 'plan', 'take', 'advantage', ""n't"", 'count', 'falling', 'love', 'again.He', 'also', ""n't"", 'count', 'fierce', 'competition', 'form', 'Dusty', 'Dinkleman', 'Klein', 'shy', 'stuttering', 'nerd', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'infatuated', 'Jamie', 'Now', 'confident', 'handsome', 'part-time', 'EMT', 'who', 'positively', 'enchanting', 'guitar', 'Dusty', 'out', 'stops', 'win', 'over', 'process', 'reveals', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'intentions', 'farcical', 'war', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'cleverly', 'disguising', 'own', 'agendas', 'fighting', 'urge', 'expose', 'other', 'lest', 'expose', 'process', 'inexperienced', 'screenwriter', 'Adam', 'Tex', 'David', 'screenplay', 'many', 'laughs', 'even-handed', 'sarcasm', 'slapstick', 'as', 'well', 'superb', 'execution', 'film', 'skilled', 'comedic', 'actors', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'stranger', 'comedies', 'starring', 'role', '2004', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'as', 'well', 'portrayal', 'womanizer', '2005', 'Waiting', 'also', 'opposite', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'delivery', 'facial', 'expression', 'are', 'dynamite', 'Klein', 'comedic', 'film', 'veteran', 'Election', 'American', 'Pie', 'ability', 'cut', 'loose', 'be', 'absolutely', 'insane', 'Dusty', 'man', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'become', 'too', 'clear', 'end.Both', 'are', 'almost', 'overshadowed', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'comedic', 'actress', 'made', 'famous', 'starring', 'role', 'Wayans', 'brothers', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'trilogy', 'Faris', 'insanely', 'funny', 'Samantha', 'James', 'ditzy', 'petulant', 'celebrity', 'who', 'sickly', 'sweet', 'one', 'moment', 'horny', 'then', 'flying', 'off', 'handle', 'next.Amy', 'Smart', 'play', 'straight', 'role', 'comedies', 'whilst', 'everyone', 'else', 'fun', 'again', 'here', 'Jamie', 'being', 'only', 'serious', 'performance', 'movie', 'still', 'own', 'next', 'Reynolds', 'Faris.Bottom', 'line', 'Replete', 'even', 'mix', 'physical', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'dose', 'wry', 'humor', 'Just', 'Friends', 'will', 'procure', 'many', 'chuckles', 'keen', 'writing', 'direction', 'performances']",N/A

969206,A5UMUVEV1RUS9,B000E6EHE0,SuperJenn,"[2, 3]","As a big Ryan Reynolds fan, I simply had to watch Just Friends. He is always such great fun in everything I've ever seen him in. Here, Reynolds plays Chris, a fat highschooler who is best friends with Jamie Palomino (Amy Smart), the prettiest girl in school. Chris of course has a major crush on Jamie, but she only sees him as her best friend and nothing more. At their graduation party however, some of the popular guys embarrass Chris and he vows to show them he's a somebody. That was 1995. Now fast forward to present day where Chris is now an incredibly handsome, incredibly fit successful music exec in L.A. He gets stuck with the task of working on a record with Samantha (Anna Faris, hilariously) who is an eccentric and wild talent to say the least. While in flight with Samantha, the plane catches fire (thanks to her microwaving aluminum foil in the plane's microwave) and they have to stop in Chris' hometown. This is of course where things take a silly turn giving us much to laugh at...Chris' determination to win Jamie over and break her heart, but he's too sweet to hurt her, Chris' competition from Dusty (Chris Klein) who sings the same ridiculous song to every woman, and let's not forget crazy Samantha who is constantly barking orders at everyone and Chris is constantly sticking her with his younger brother Mike. Chris & Mike's mom is also an absolute riot. Just Friends is a great way to mellow out and watch something that will make you laugh until your sides hurt and make you smile at the end. Great bonus features on the DVD too. This one's a keeper!

969211,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000E6EHE0,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[13, 19]","You: ""Wait a minute! Thornhill went to see ""Just Friends"", that movie with Ryan Reynolds (""Blade: Trinity"", ""Waiting"", ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder"") in the fat suit? I don't believe it"".Me: Well, yes. It was a choice between ""Just Friends"" or the remake ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" starring Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo. Now, the only reason anyone remade ""Yours"", based on a 1968 film starring Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda, is because of the success of Steve Martin's ""Cheaper By the Dozen"" last year. Let's face it, the only reason anyone even remembers the 1968 film is because Lucy starred in it. I tried to watch it recently, and it was just a boring, boring film. It picks up a little when Lucy does a little of her patented physical comedy, but this doesn't happen until fifty (yes, fifty) minutes into the film. So, it was a choice between a new comedy that could possibly offer a few laughs and a remake of a bad film meant to capitalize on the success of another bad film? Hmmmmm!Frankly, I was surprised by how much I laughed. Not everyone who watches this film will probably enjoy it, but the first hour of the 90 minute film contains a lot of funny jokes.Chris (Ryan Reynolds) and Jamie (Amy Smart) are high school best friends, cheerleaders and devoted to each other. Chris is also very overweight. On the night of their graduation, Chris hopes that their relationship will go the extra step and they will become boyfriend and girlfriend. As Jamie unintentionally does things to turn him on, a parade of other suitors barge in, interrupting Chris' attempts to express his feelings to her. Embarrassed, Chris runs away from the party. Ten years later, Chris has moved to LA, landed a job in the music industry and apparently excercised quite a bit, because he is now a handsome young man, a handsome, egotistical young ladies man. His boss (Stephen Root) tells him to babysit Samantha James (Anna Faris), the newest Ashlee Simpson/ Paris Hilton wannabee, and get her to sign with their company. Samantha is overjoyed to see Chris, a former boyfriend, and they set off to Paris for the holidays. A problem with the private jet, forces them to land in his hometown of Trenton, New Jersey and he meets Jamie again.The poster, which features Reynolds in his fat suit huddled with Amy Smart, might make you might think, as I did, that the film would predominately feature fat jokes in every guise and form. Thankfully, this is only a small portion of the film. Quickly, we flash forward ten years and meet Chris, circa 2005. Sweet, caring Chris has transformed himself into the complete opposite of his former self and this creates a lot of the comedy when he returns home for a short visit.This isn't to say that the beginning is without laughs. Reynolds does a good job of capturing the two sides of Chris. As fat Chris, Reynolds makes him a charming, shy guy devoted to his friends. He just has difficulty expressing his true feelings to Jamie. He stands in front of his mirror, lip syncing to All-4-One, preparing himself for Jamie's high school graduation party. He writes his feelings in her yearbook and wants to have a few moments alone, for her to read it. After a few moments, with constant interruptions, Chris gets a chance to read it to her, but realizes that he has the wrong book. This scene is funny and sets a raucous tone for the rest of the film.For about an hour, or so, the film lives up to this promise and is more funny than you could expect. Anna Faris, as Samantha James, is a real standout. A hyper-stylized charicature of Ashlee Simpson (the bad singing) and Paris Hilton (the dumb blond), Faris is very funny. She has both characters down to a tee and watching these two personalities blend into one is very funny and even a little scary. What if such a person did exist? It isn't a very far stretch of the imagination. She steals pretty much every scene she appears in. Chris asks his younger brother, Mike, to watch Samantha, which he readily agrees to, because he is more than a little infatuated with the `singer'.When the story focuses of present day Chris, Reynolds seems to have fun portraying different aspects of Chris' character, in an attempt to win Jamie back. First, he tries the new Chris out on his former high school chum. Unfortunately, the new Chris is the type of man who uses women and then dumps them, exactly the type of guy Jamie has consistently been associated with, and it doesn't work. Then Chris tries a reincarnation of his former self, who he affectionately refers to as the ""Biggest Puss_"" in the world. It is fun to watch these different characters surface and his attitudes change.The last portion of the film grinds to a halt as Chris and Jamie try to work out the problems in their relationship. Just as Chris thinks he has won Jamie, he starts a fight with her and she leaves in a huff. He flies back to Los Angeles, than flies back to Trenton, and back and forth, and this and that, and why can't we do this and why can't we do that. This part of the film begins to resemble an extended episode of ""Dr. Phil"" and really drags the rest of the film down.The film's technical merits are small. Director Roger Kumble (""Cruel Intentions"") keeps all of the action closed in. Everything takes place in interiors or small areas outdoors. I think this was an effort to hide the fact that the film was shot in Canada, when it is supposed to take place in New Jersey. The more confined and focused the shot, the less you have to worry about seeing something that doesn't fit.Also, the film has a slightly grainy, darker look all of which makes me believe that the film was made for a low budget. It is still a funny film, but how great it would have been to have a technically well-made, funny film. Instead, it just looks cheap.""Just Friends"" has some good laughs, certainly more than I expected. You should certainly give it a try at a bargain matinee or rent the DVD.",3,60 Minutes of Funny...
