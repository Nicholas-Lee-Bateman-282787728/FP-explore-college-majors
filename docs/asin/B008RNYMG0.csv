1574716,A2582KMXLK2P06,B008RNYMG0,B. E Jackson,"[4, 5]","That's My Boy is a hard movie to rate.  We're talking about a really *really* immature and highly inappropriate type of comedy.  There's hardly a plot for the most part, other than Adam walking around being a dirty little buffoon and yet, here I am- enjoying it!The story is that when Adam was a little boy, he found one of his teachers unbelievably attractive and... wow, this is crazy, it turns out the feeling was mutual!  The teacher finds HIM attractive as well!  This means she actually hits on him one day during after school detention, lol.  I was like ""Let me guess, Adam's dreaming this part"" but... NO!  This is really happening!  The hottest teacher ever is actually *doing* him behind the stage curtain in the auditorium!Well you can probably guess what happens when an adult teacher does *that* to a student... she's sent to jail, and 30 years later Adam Sander is all grown up... and about as clueless as one can possibly be.  It turns out the two of them made a child together, and the child is now approaching 30 years old and about to get married and... guess who crashes the wedding?  Yup, Adam Sandler.  And boy does he crash it in the most hilarious way ever.Both Adam and his son keep it a secret that the two of them are related, so of course the moments where they almost spill the beans are pretty funny.  The characters throughout this film are really memorable.  The old lady with sexual urges, the strict young man in the ""army"", Adam's shy, but forgiving and likeable son, the son's attractive -but secretly playing two sides- wife, and of course, the obnoxious behavior of Adam Sandler himself.  Everyone's fantastic.The story centers around Adam's son always ALWAYS finding himself on the wrong end of every situation.  It's like everyone is deliberately making it their own mission to pick on him at every single ripe opportunity, but as fate would have it, they actually love Adam Sandler (well, not always) much to the surprise of his son.So many memorable segments that it's really hard to pick a highlight.  I think Adam's attraction to the older lady that results in a few disgusting and impossible-to-share sexual situations is easily one of the funniest parts, as is the sexual encounter with a wedding dress and another too-offensive-to-share moment in how the wife was able to detect who did it.  For the most part the storyline focuses around the build-up to the wedding and of course, saves the actual wedding until the very end when, let's just say, several realy dirty secrets are revealed.  Oh and um, let's not forget this part- ""Don't tell mommy about our secret tickle time!  Oooooh GOD!  You actually give it a NAME?!?!""Overall, I gotta admit I haven't laughed this hard in a while.  The stripper with the big breasts was uh... really nice to see.  I highly recommend this film under one important condition- you find Adam Sandler funny at least a *little* bit.

I keep thinking that I am going to get at least some good laughs out of a Sandler movie like I did from a couple of his earlier ones- like ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""The Wedding Singer"" but they actually keep getting worse and worse.  I thought he hit a new low with ""Grown Ups"" but ""That's my Boy"" surpasses it in awfulness as it adds to the ad hoc nature and feel of Sandler screen plays by being extremely and totally gratuitously vulgar and obscene.  I have to wonder if the script to this mess was made up as they went along.  This is a long film as well for a comedy.  It never seems to end.Sandler plays a washed up 80's lower class celeb icon who impregnated his junior high teacher and who, after many years of separation from his son, goes to find him on his son's wedding weekend so he can ask for money to pay off his tax debt or else go to prison.  His character is not funny or lovable - just a crass boring loudmouthed cretin whom we are supposed to believe everyone in the movie just loves for some reason- I guess because he is ""real"".  He isn't.  He is a sad caricature of a ""Masshole"" and as someone from Massachusetts- I found this movie to be insulting just on that level alone.  There is literally nothing to like about this character- but everyone in the film just loves him for no reason.  Every scene is a setup for some unfunny vulgar gag.  This movie actually got painful to watch.  I wanted to turn it off- but sorta like rubbernecking when you pass a car crash on the highway- I kept watching it until the bitter dumb predictable end.At one time Sandler had something.  But even his best movies were never great movies.  But now- it's like he just churns out this garbage for some assured expected lowest return.  This movie actually feels like they got a movie set- a nice beach front house- and then just decided to make up a movie on the fly as they vacationed there.  It's an insult.  A bad movie- made in bad faith.  I won't make the mistake again of getting one of his films via pay per view.  As for going to a theater to see a Sandler pic?  Please.

Directed by writer/filmmaker Sean Anders (""Hot Tub Time Machine"", ""She's Out of My League"", ""Sex Drive"") and written by David Caspe (""Happy Endings"").Starring Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg with many guest appearances from popular TV and music stars (from the '80s to present time) and well-known sports figures, ""That's My Boy"" would receive the reputation of being his most offensive film (and some critics will call it his worst) to date.The film begins with a  young 14-year-old teen named Donny Berger (portrayed by Justin Weaver) who has sworn off girls and has only eyes for his 22-year-old teacher Mary McGarricle (portrayed by Eva Amurri Martino, daughter of Susan Sarandon).Donny tries to attract his teacher with Van Halen tickets but disgusted that her student would hit on her, she gives him detention.  While in detention, Ms. McGarricle confesses to Donny that she has the hots for him and she takes him to her office and has sex with him.The student and teacher then continue to have a sexual relationship and during graduation, the two are having sex again, in which everyone can hear them.  When the curtains are opened, to the adult teachers, they are shocked to find Ms. McGarricle having improper relations with her student, while the students give Donny a standing ovation.Ms. McGarricle is charged with statutory rape and is pregnant with Donny's child.  Because she has no remorse of what she had done, she is sentence to 30-years in prison.  Donny has been given custody of the child after its birth and raise his son on his own.And life for Donny throughout the '80s and '90s has earned him amazing fame as the teen who had sex with his teacher.  Making him a wealthy man but also a bad father.Fastfoward to the present and we learn that Donny has wasted all his money and to make things worse, he has not paid any taxes to the IRS and must come up with over $40,000 or else he will be serving time in prison.  So, immediately, Donny must find a way to get that money.His manager Jim Nance (portrayed by NY Jets Coach Rex Ryan) tells him to contact his son.  But Donny said he has not heard from his overweight son Han Solo for years.Meanwhile, we see Han Solo (portrayed by Andy Samberg), who has now gone by the name of Todd, not overweight and doing quite well financially.  He is engaged to a woman named Jamie (portrayed by Leighton Meester) and both are busy planning for their upcoming wedding.While visiting his favorite strip club and telling his woes to stripper Champale (portrayed by Luenell).  Her daughter Brie (portrayed by Ciara) brings a publication that shows Todd and Jamie getting married and now Donny has come up with an idea.Donny goes to producer Randall Morgan (portrayed by Dan Patrick) with a show angle of what if he can reunite himself , his son and his mother Mary (present version portrayed by Susan Sarandon) for an upcoming reality special.  And if he does, he'll receive the money to prevent him from going to prison.At the wedding site, Todd meets his future in-laws Gerald (portrayed by Blake Clark) and Helen (portrayed by Meagen Fay), grandma Delores (portrayed by Peggy Stewart), the soldier and Jamie's overprotective brother Chad (portrayed by Milo Ventimiglia).  But also hoping that he gets promoted for a significant job owned by Steve Spirou (portrayed by Tony Orlando).As everyone is getting prepared and discussing the wedding, Donny shows up to meet with his son but shocked that his father would make an appearance, Donny concocts a scheme that he is Todd's best friend because he saved his life (as Todd nearly died trying to pick up a burrito he dropped near an incoming train).As the family welcomes Donny's presence for the wedding, Jamie is shocked that Todd would know someone who looks like someone from the trailer park.When Donny and his son have alone time, we learn that Donny was not a good father for his son.  Giving him ice cream and candy, it led to his son being overweight and always making fun of his son, to the point that he permanently had a ""New Kids on the Block"" tattoo done on his son's back.While Donny does not welcome his father being there, Donny who was there trying to find a way to get money, starts to find himself wanting to bond with his son and actually show that he cares for him.VIDEO:""That's My Boy"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).

And most of the time, critics despise the films but yet, the films attract an audience who wants to see outrageous comedy and to see how far Adam Sandler will go.""That's My Boy"" is a film in which Adam Sandler takes things very far, to the point he knows that the film will offend people, but also tries to showcase a lot of talent via guest cameos.If you are a viewer who is easily offended, this film is not for you.  The film tries to use a comedic portrayal of pedophilia, incest and statutory rape and many people are not going to be thrilled with what they see in this film.  While those who are used to moronic comedy and enjoy how outrageous these films will go, will find it hilarious (or just plain out dumb).For example, as a viewer, there are scenes to show that Donny is a man that is well-endowed and we see that he is often needing to relieve himself by masturbation or having sex with someone.  So, in one scene, he uses an old photo of Jamie's grandmother.  The following morning, the grandmother sees sticky tissues all over the place and his son tries to clean up the mess while the tissues are all stuck to his hand.Another example is Donny doing the popular Budweiser catchphrase from the '90s ""Whazzap"" and everyone hoping it would be used again, start repeating it.Or the guest appearances of Vanilla Ice, a person like Donny who splurged all his money during his fame and is now upset with Donny for having sex with his mother.  Or Todd Bridges, a former drug addict who has white powder on his nose constantly.  And possibly the most visible scene features actress Luenell as a stripper with her boobs hanging out with pasties and dancing on a poll.There are a lot of those ""I can't believe they are doing this!"" type of moments throughout the film and many thrown in for comedic shock factor.  As well as a film that showcases a good number of celebrity cameos to make it a bit more entertaining.""That's My Boy"" is nowhere close to being one of the better Happy Madison, let alone Adam Sandler films out there.  It's moronically funny and entertaining in a Happy Madison sense but other than that.  People used to this humor will have no problem being entertained but those who know they will be offended, should stay away from this film.I'm not quick to pan Happy Madison films.  They have their niche audience and fans know that they can get something crazy or something so moronic, that they enjoy these films.  And the fact that I review them often and defend them, goes to show that even I have a soft spot in my heart for moronic, juvenile humor and I'm not easily offended by these comedy films.Yes, this film was controversial and is considered as Adam Sandler's most offensive film yet.  But for those who are used to Happy Madison/Adam Sandler films, you know what kind of film you're going to get.  And if you love moronic comedy and wanting to see how far Adam Sandler can push the button, let alone a film featuring so many guest cameos, ""That's My Boy"" may be a comedy film that will interest you!",3,"Yes, this film was controversial and is considered as Adam Sandler's most offensive film yet but is it good?",1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,9086,"['Happy', 'Madison', 'Films', 'back', 'new',

1574754,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B008RNYMG0,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[10, 20]","I'm a very hard person to make laugh when it comes to comedies, primarily because they're one of my favorite genres of film, thus meaning I've seen a vast amount of them. Out of all of these, Adam Sandler's films have historically given me some of the funniest bits I've ever seen, such as ""Happy Gilmore"", ""Billy Madison"", and ""The Waterboy."" Heck, I even enjoyed ""You Don't Mess With The Zohan."" However, last year's ""Jack and Jill"" was an unfortunate misstep for the beloved comedian, being completely devoid of laughs and making me wonder if Sandler was beginning to lose his touch. Seeing reviews for his newest film, ""That's My Boy"", didn't exactly inspire a load of confidence. But being a fan, I gave it a shot, and I'm glad I did. His newest outing is one of his best, and one of the most alarmingly funny films I've seen in years. Don't listen to the critics, folks, this is Sandler and SNL vet Andy Samberg doing what they do best: being raucous, dirty, and downright gut-busting.Sandler plays Donny, who knocked up his beautiful teacher while he was going through puberty. The state forced the child upon him while his teacher got sent to prison, and the results weren't pretty. They were so hideous, in fact, that his child grew up and made up a fake story about his parents being dead just to escape from his dad. It paid off: the son, Han Solo aka Todd (played by Samberg), became one of the youngest hedge fund managers and began raking in the money, thus making him an eligible bachelor for his fiance, played by the lovely Leighton Meester. Dear old dad, on the other hand, grew up to be white trash and desperately in need of money in order to pay taxes stretching back to 1994. When finding out that his kid is successful, Donny aims to get the whole family back together in order to make bank from a TV deal. When party animal and uptight businessman collide... well, you've seen movies like this, so you can begin to guess what kind of antics ensue.Only you can't, and that's what makes this movie so funny. Using the ""R"" rating to its full advantage, Sandler and Samberg flip up the lid on their potty mouthes and don't let it down until the credits roll. Much like this year's ""Ted"", ""That's My Boy"" is the latest in a rash of comedies that are unafraid to be truly raunchy. From the borderline offensive premise to one of the funniest masturbation jokes in recent memory, everything about this movie is incredibly rude and crude. This is the kind of film that Sandler belongs in, though, and not neutered junk like ""Jack and Jill"", or family tripe like ""Bedtime Stories."" When he's told to go all out, he does it with great gusto. For the first time in years, I had a fun time watching Sandler, and was reminded of his older work.What makes this film rise above typical Sandler fare, though, is the stellar supporting cast, the most important member of which is Samberg. When both of the characters are together, the sparks fly, and you can see a look in both actors' eyes indicating that they're having a truly great time making this movie. Solo, Samberg is a capable comedian, but with one of the greats, he's solid gold. There are several times when it seems obvious that both actors are improvising their banter, but with such a gifted duo, that's not a bad thing. Only one or two jokes turn up flat, and their sour taste is quickly washed away.With sex gags galore, a great supporting cast, a suitably cheesy soundtrack (when's the last you got to hear some Ratt?), and a surprise appearance by Susan Sarandon, still aging like fine wine, ""That's My Boy"" is not a great film.

1574767,A55RQ26WDPSM0,B008RNYMG0,Iusedtobeacat,"[0, 0]","The story is Interesting. Really, for a Romantic Comedy. I mean if I would choose any word to describe this movie with I would pick ""Taboo"". It really does tackle issues that are considered abnormal in today's society and unexpected which makes the plot stand out from your average Comedy films You Know. For Example: Danny as a 13 year old has an affair with his insanely attractive Math teacher who's probably in her mid to late 20s and ought been married by now but instead of dating her boss or colleagues decides to pick her minor student as her lover as well as her sex partner and of course a 13 year old kid won't show any protests to that, ultimately they get caught in the act in front of the entire school, predictably enough the teacher gets sent to jail as a punishment for her crime but the twist here is that neither parties show any remorse, the movie makes the situation seems honest soo honest in fact it comes off as ""What? Really?"" I mean in real life if a teacher gets caught sleeping with her high school student she'll most likely cry and wimper and the kid will be sent to a psychiatrist for being traumatized because he's been god forbid sexually abused all his life. But in the story Danny goes on to lead a happy, fame filled life, perfectly normal and his teacher not only gets sent to jail but the product of their love is a baby that Danny raises to be a grown man who's so unappreciative towards his father that he runs away at the age of 18 and goes on to being successful while his father lives as a washed up celebrity with so much debt on his credit that he will go to jail if he doesn't pay it off. So the solution to all his problems is either go to jail or ask help from his estranged son who masked his identity completely and doesn't want anything to do with his biological father so Donny has to get introduced to his son's fiancee, boss, future in laws etc.. without any of them knowing that he's the father.OK, as a comedy the sense of humor doesn't really fit in with the rest. It's more of a dark humor but the dialogue is weak it wasn't sophisticated like most movies of the same genre so I'll give that a pass. The story itself is a cookie cutter in the end, yes it has twists and turns all over but the ending is as usual predictable. I liked the message that the producers tried to send across mostly it's a message about the importance of having a family in our lives and it also depicts a beautiful though hugely inappropriate by today's standards love story between 13 year old Donny and his Teacher. But the bigger picture is just simply love. I love those type of films that are heartwarming and engaging at the same time. I would've liked it if the dialogue was just a tad more witty and the jokes weren't all that funny especially those with potty humor but they weren't many so it's fine.This is probably the best Adam Sandler has starred in a very long time, his movies the last couple of years were just horrifying and extremely boring dare I mention the Grown Ups? UGH! So, yeah what saved this from being a total wreck for me is the twisted story I'm kinda drawn to the sins of human nature if you know what I mean so for that I'll give it a 3 stars because in my opinion Comedies in general nowadays hardly deserve anything above 4 unless they were extremely spectacular.Just watch it and see for yourself, not the best movie out there but it's fun for fun times I mean me and My boyfriend watched this just to waste time and I think if you're looking for something entertaining but light then this movie should do.",3,An Interesting Concept but is lacking in Execution,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,3577,"['story', 'Interesting', 'Really', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'mean', 'would', 'choose', 'word', 'describe', 'movie', 'would', 'pick', 'Taboo', 'really', 'tackle', 'issues', 'are', 'considered', 'abnormal', 'today', 'society', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'stand', 'out', 'average', 'Comedy', 'films', 'Know', 'Example', 'Danny', '13', 'year', 'old', 'affair', 'insanely', 'attractive', 'Math', 'teacher', 'who', 'probably', 'mid', 'late', '20s', 'ought', 'been', 'married', 'now', 'instead', 'dating', 'boss', 'colleagues', 'decides', 'pick', 'minor', 'student', 'lover', 'as', 'well', 'sex', 'partner', 'course', '13', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'wo', ""n't"", 'show', 'protests', 'ultimately', 'get', 'caught', 'act', 'front', 'entire', 'school', 'predictably', 'teacher', 'sent', 'jail', 'punishment', 'crime', 'twist', 'here', 'parties', 'show', 'remorse', 'movie', 'situation', 'honest', 'soo', 'honest', 'fact', 'off', 'What', 'Really', 'mean', 'real', 'life', 'teacher', 'caught', 'sleeping', 'high', 'school', 'student', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'cry', 'wimper', 'kid', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'psychiatrist', 'being', 'traumatized', 'been', 'god', 'forbid', 'sexually', 'abused', 'life', 'story', 'Danny', 'lead', 'happy', 'fame', 'filled', 'life', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'teacher', 'not', 'only', 'sent', 'jail', 'product', 'love', 'baby', 'Danny', 'be', 'grown', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'unappreciative', 'towards', 'father', 'away', 'age', '18', 'being', 'successful', 'father', 'washed', 'up', 'celebrity', 'so', 'much', 'debt', 'credit', 'will', 'go', 'jail', ""n't"", 'pay', 'off', 'solution', 'problems', 'either', 'go', 'jail', 'ask', 'help', 'estranged', 'son', 'who', 'masked', 'identity', 'completely', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'biological', 'father', 'so', 'Donny', 'get', 'introduced', 'son', 'fiancee', 'boss', 'future', 'laws', 'etc..', 'knowing', 'father.OK', 'comedy', 'sense', 'humor', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'rest', 'more', 'dark', 'humor', 'dialogue', 'weak', 'was', ""n't"", 'sophisticated', 'most', 'movies', 'same', 'genre', ""'ll"", 'give', 'pass', 'story', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'end', 'yes', 'twists', 'ending', 'as', 'usual', 'predictable', 'liked', 'message', 'producers', 'tried', 'send', 'mostly', 'message', 'importance', 'having', 'family', 'lives', 'also', 'beautiful', 'hugely', 'inappropriate', 'today', 'standards', 'love', 'story', '13', 'year', 'old', 'Donny', 'Teacher', 'bigger', 'picture', 'just', 'simply', 'love', 'love', 'type', 'films', 'are', 'heartwarming', 'engaging', 'same', 'time', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'dialogue', 'was', 'just', 'tad', 'more', 'witty', 'jokes', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'especially', 'potty', 'humor', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'fine.This', 'probably', 'best', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'starred', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'movies', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'were', 'just', 'horrifying', 'extremely', 'boring', 'dare', 'mention', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'UGH', 'So', 'yeah', 'what', 'saved', 'being', 'total', 'wreck', 'twisted', 'story', ""'m"", 'kinda', 'drawn', 'sins', 'human', 'nature', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'so', ""'ll"", 'give', '3', 'stars', 'opinion', 'Comedies', 'general', 'nowadays', 'hardly', 'deserve', 'anything', '4', 'were', 'extremely', 'spectacular.Just', 'watch', 'see', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'there', 'fun', 'fun', 'times', 'mean', 'My', 'boyfriend', 'watched', 'just', 'waste', 'time', 'think', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'entertaining', 'light', 'then', 'movie', 'should', 'do']",N/A

Funniest movie I've seen since Pineapple Express, one of the few Apatow movies that isn't watered down ""mature"" movies for ""adults"" and/or babies. Adam Sandler's character is really good. You may not understand this, reviewers/critics/current movie watchers/Hollywood snobs but a character like Sandler's is MUCH HARDER TO PULL OFF THAN A CARDBOARD-THIN APATOW CHARACTER. In Apatow world everyone feels safe and warm, no risks are taken and a little ""raunchy"" dialogue is inserted to appease guys dragged to the boring proverbial Snoozefest. This Sandler movie, however, is the real-deal kind of comedy movie where you just laugh your a@@ off. I could not stop laughing for the life of me, and it felt really good to laugh again at a movie. No caveats were made so that no one felt uncomfortable, it was just balls to the wall, straight up comedy. We definitely need more movies like That's My Boy.Samberg was at times kind of bad but such a strong cast of misfits he kind of fits in, so I forgive him and look forward to more movie with him. Andy's choice of movies to me is astonishing since he's supposed to turn into a creme de la creme Hollywood star after being internet famous on SNL. Instead he has the balls to do a movie that's probably funnier cumulatively than OLD SCHOOL. I mean, I like Will Ferrell, it's just, his movies now are horrible. Samberg's got a ways, a long ways to go to be on Will Ferrells level, but such a risky, honest choice for a kind of debut movie. Hey, Sandler's first movie was horrible too, something to do with a boat and chicks, I've never seen it. So, kudos! You slate has been wiped clean!

The whole story of a jr. high/high school kid having sex with a teacher and getting her pregnant had a lot of potential, but the end result was just very ""meh."" A lot of big reviewers found the topic to be vulgar, but it could've turned out to be a pretty good comedy. Sadly, I didn't get much more than a few chuckles here and there.Lately Sandler's movies in general have been very bland and feel almost forced. The last one I really enjoyed was ""Grown Ups."" After that they were all pretty average. I wanted to like Sandler's character here, but I couldn't. Between his weird accent and the way he acted it was just a turnoff. Samberg isn't much better either. Once again I wanted to like his character, but he just feels very awkward and almost uncomfortable when you see him in a scene.I have to admit that, even though I feel guilty because of it, most of my laughs came from the scenes with Vanilla Ice. I don't know what it was but almost every scene he was in I let out a chuckle. I'm not saying he's an A+ actor and I'm not really looking forward to seeing him in any future films, but he wasn't bad here. The rest of the supporting cast was decent. However, it was nice to see Will Forte, Susan Sarandon, Blake Clark, Nick Swardson and James Caan.Towards the end I felt like the movie was trying too hard to stretch out the length. It tried to close up on a mature note with dad saving the day and reuniting, but it wasn't very convincing. On top of it most of the plot twists were pretty generic and felt kind of expected. Except the whole sister-brother thing. Wasn't expecting that.Overall Score: 4/10 - As the title says this isn't anything fantastic or groundbreaking, and it's far from Sandler's best work.

Same co-stars, but this one has only Nick Swardson...no Rob Schneider though...in a way, this is like comfort food...BUT the plot felt a bit fresher and the new co-stars and cameos raise the bar a bit.I found the premise kinda funny in spite of his tastelessness...13 y.o. obnoxious teen Donny Berger knocks up his 7th grade teacher, becomes an overnight star, then washed up & broke 25 years later...typical for many child actors, and his kid escaped...Sandler's character was a bad dad...but he wants to make it up to his kid Han Solo (all grown up and played by Andy Samberg) when he found out he was getting married and changed his name.He visits Han unexpectedly and all hell breaks loose...surprise fun cameo and side roles appear, from Leighton Meester to Tony Orlando to Vanilla Ice to James Caan (no surprise as JC was mentioned in Adam's ""Chanukah Song"") to his kids as the lemonade stand girls...many times, these cameo roles are better than the main ones.  But two that made total sense was Eva Amurri as the teacher (she was sexy/smoking...if she was my teacher in 7th grade, I'd have had the hots for her too...I totally 100% admit), and 25 years later in prison, the role was played by her famous mother, Susan Sarandon...they totally look alike...One major letdown was too much Van Halen on the soundtrack (and young Donnie loved them...tickets to their gig)...I passionately hate that band!!  I know teenage boys loved them in the 80s...but I was not one of them, and when at least 3 VH songs came on, I utterly cringed...otherwise, I actually enjoyed the flick against my better judgement...and at least one pivotal moment was just too gross to explain, nor do I wish to spoil the surprise of it, and it had a happy ending, so that was nice.In the end, if you love Adam Sandler's work, you will enjoy this flick...",3,Adam Sandler is a guilty pleasure...and this flick is no different.,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,1940,"['My', 'Boy', 'typical', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'formula', 'sticks', 'even', 'when', 'plots', 'differ', 'Same', 'co-stars', 'one', 'only', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'way', 'comfort', 'food', 'BUT', 'plot', 'felt', 'bit', 'fresher', 'new', 'co-stars', 'cameos', 'raise', 'bar', 'bit.I', 'found', 'premise', 'kinda', 'funny', 'spite', 'tastelessness', '13', 'y.o', 'obnoxious', 'teen', 'Donny', 'Berger', 'up', '7th', 'grade', 'teacher', 'overnight', 'star', 'then', 'washed', 'up', 'broke', '25', 'years', 'later', 'typical', 'many', 'child', 'actors', 'kid', 'escaped', 'Sandler', 'character', 'was', 'bad', 'dad', 'make', 'up', 'kid', 'Han', 'Solo', 'grown', 'up', 'played', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'when', 'found', 'was', 'getting', 'married', 'changed', 'name.He', 'visits', 'Han', 'unexpectedly', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'surprise', 'fun', 'cameo', 'side', 'roles', 'appear', 'Leighton', 'Meester', 'Tony', 'Orlando', 'Vanilla', 'Ice', 'James', 'Caan', 'surprise', 'JC', 'was', 'mentioned', 'Adam', 'Chanukah', 'Song', 'kids', 'lemonade', 'stand', 'girls', 'many', 'times', 'cameo', 'roles', 'are', 'better', 'main', 'ones', 'two', 'made', 'total', 'sense', 'was', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'teacher', 'was', 'sexy/smoking', 'was', 'teacher', '7th', 'grade', ""'d"", 'have', 'had', 'hots', 'too', 'totally', '100', '%', 'admit', '25', 'years', 'later', 'prison', 'role', 'was', 'played', 'famous', 'mother', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'totally', 'look', 'alike', 'One', 'major', 'letdown', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'Van', 'Halen', 'soundtrack', 'young', 'Donnie', 'loved', 'tickets', 'gig', 'passionately', 'hate', 'band', 'know', 'teenage', 'boys', 'loved', '80s', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'when', 'least', '3', 'VH', 'songs', 'came', 'utterly', 'cringed', 'otherwise', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'flick', 'better', 'judgement', 'least', 'one', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'gross', 'explain', 'do', 'wish', 'spoil', 'surprise', 'had', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'nice.In', 'end', 'love', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'work', 'will', 'enjoy', 'flick']",N/A

Jack & Jill looked like Sandler was scraping the very bottom of the barrel of old SNL skit characters to make into a movie. When seeing the trailer for this movie, I thought Sandler had hit rock bottom and this movie was going to be the nail in the coffin for his cinematic releases in future.How wrong I was! I was going to dismiss this movie and not even bother to check it out, but a friend who doesn't laugh at much at all recommended it saying it was hilarious. So we checked it out, and now I am glad I did not pass on this one. Even tho Sandler's character didn't seem real and fairly badly acted, like a drunken Billy Madison, it was still an enjoyable movie in the end.Sandler plays a has been celebrity who reached fame as a child by impregnating his teacher in the 8th grade? She went to jail, but he became a celebrity... but over the years, he faded out of the spotlight and had now become a broke down slob who owes about forty thousand dollars in back taxes. He goes to what few friends he has left in show business and asks to borrow money, but none will give it to him. He then makes an offer to a producer about earning $50,000 for a reunion show with him and his teacher in prison, who I think is now his wife? But the producer says instead, how about a reunion show with you, your wife and your son.The son left Sandlers character when he was 18 to have nothing to do with him ever again. His son however is getting married soon and Sandler seeks him and his new in-laws out to talk his son into doing the show. However, upon arrival, the son has told his in-laws his parents are dead, so Sandler steps in and pretends to be his sons best friend and makes up ridicules stories about how they met. Now his father is his sons best man, not by the sons choice and you can get the drift of where it goes from there as the son doesn't want anyone to know that guy is his dad. Then of coarse, the usual Happy Madison plot takes place where Sandler screws up something, and redeems himself by the end.The humor of this movie is not kid humor, a lot of it is adult humor and almost blue in some areas, and that's how I like it! I didn't expect this movie to be this dirty or for that matter, be funny at all, but it was... to me anyway. Sandlers side kick celebrity new comer side kick is Vanilla Ice, and I think there is a few other appearances by people who where big in the 80's early 90's and have since gone into the ""where are they now"" unemployment line. Ice doesn't mind making fun of himself, so his role was enjoyable to watch.A lot of WTF moments and sick humor, so if you like that, definitely give this movie a rent and see how it sits with you.",3,Surprisingly better then I thought it would be!!!,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,2760,"['Sandler', 'last', 'couple', 'movies', 'was', 'losing', 'faith', 'Sandler', 'still', 'had', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'looked', 'Sandler', 'was', 'scraping', 'very', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'old', 'SNL', 'skit', 'characters', 'make', 'movie', 'When', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'movie', 'thought', 'Sandler', 'had', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'nail', 'coffin', 'cinematic', 'releases', 'future.How', 'wrong', 'was', 'was', 'going', 'dismiss', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'bother', 'check', 'out', 'friend', 'who', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'much', 'recommended', 'saying', 'was', 'hilarious', 'checked', 'out', 'now', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'pass', 'one', 'Even', 'tho', 'Sandler', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'fairly', 'badly', 'acted', 'drunken', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'end.Sandler', 'been', 'celebrity', 'who', 'reached', 'fame', 'child', 'impregnating', 'teacher', '8th', 'grade', 'went', 'jail', 'became', 'celebrity', 'years', 'faded', 'spotlight', 'had', 'now', 'become', 'broke', 'down', 'slob', 'who', 'forty', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'back', 'taxes', 'what', 'few', 'friends', 'left', 'show', 'business', 'borrow', 'money', 'none', 'will', 'give', 'then', 'offer', 'producer', 'earning', '50,000', 'reunion', 'show', 'teacher', 'prison', 'who', 'think', 'now', 'wife', 'producer', 'instead', 'how', 'reunion', 'show', 'wife', 'son.The', 'son', 'left', 'Sandlers', 'character', 'when', 'was', '18', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'ever', 'again', 'son', 'however', 'getting', 'married', 'soon', 'Sandler', 'new', 'in-laws', 'talk', 'son', 'doing', 'show', 'However', 'arrival', 'son', 'told', 'in-laws', 'parents', 'are', 'dead', 'so', 'Sandler', 'steps', 'pretends', 'be', 'sons', 'best', 'friend', 'up', 'ridicules', 'stories', 'how', 'met', 'Now', 'father', 'sons', 'best', 'man', 'not', 'sons', 'choice', 'can', 'get', 'drift', 'where', 'there', 'son', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'know', 'guy', 'dad', 'Then', 'coarse', 'usual', 'Happy', 'Madison', 'plot', 'place', 'where', 'Sandler', 'up', 'something', 'end.The', 'humor', 'movie', 'not', 'kid', 'humor', 'lot', 'adult', 'humor', 'almost', 'blue', 'areas', 'how', 'like', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'be', 'dirty', 'matter', 'be', 'funny', 'was', 'anyway', 'Sandlers', 'side', 'kick', 'celebrity', 'new', 'comer', 'side', 'kick', 'Vanilla', 'Ice', 'think', 'few', 'other', 'appearances', 'people', 'who', 'where', 'big', '80', 'early', '90', 'have', 'gone', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'unemployment', 'line', 'Ice', ""n't"", 'mind', 'making', 'fun', 'role', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'watch.A', 'lot', 'WTF', 'moments', 'sick', 'humor', 'so', 'like', 'definitely', 'give', 'movie', 'rent', 'see', 'how']",N/A

1574824,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B008RNYMG0,Poor Napoleon,"[11, 16]","I'd like to know what happened to Adam Sandler.  He used to be funny.  While I'm not a huge fan of his, I love Happy Gilmore and the Wedding Singer.  I loved his dramatic turns in Punch Drunk Love, and the oft dismissed Spanglish.  Even the anemic family film Bedtime Stories is OK.  But then he churned out movies like Jack and Jill.  And then her churned out this.  I wouldn't normaly waste time in reviewing such tripe, but I felt I had to vent.  I had to warn people about this bile of a film.  ""That's My Boy"" in its near two hour running time is the most unfunny, offensive, mean spirited film I have seen.  And I've seen some pretty bad films.  The words and images that appeared on my TV screen just made my jaw drop.  The fact that the likes of Sandler, Andy Samburg, James Caan, and Susan Sarandon grace this garbage is enough to make you shake your head after watching it.I honestly don't know where to begin.  The premise involves Sandler's character, as a child, having a child with his teacher.  The teacher is subsequently locked up while the child grows up to be Andy Sammberg and Sandler as his neglegent ""manchild"" father.  Sandler becomes something of a c list celebrity, capitializing on his 15 minutes of fame as a victim of underage sex with an adult.  So if that's the type of thing you find funny, this movie is for you.The movie then offers a series of gags involving incest, vomit, urination, old people saying and doing dirty things, and a cringeworthy gag involving ""wassssuppp."" It was vulgar joke after vulgar joke. The only thing I found mildly amusing is the friendship Sandler's character has with Vanilla Ice, but that's about it.  And Andy Samberg, who has his moments on SNL and can be incredibly funny, is wasted here with the material.  Sarandon and Caan are really wasted here and are almost certainly cashing a paycheck.I once liked Sandler, but this movie scrapes the bottom of the barrel of r-rated humor.  It seems Sandler's reaching to make edgier comedy in a post Appatow world, but he's not Judd Appatow.  I like the occaisonal dirty joke - if it's funny and clever.

Sandler was going more the slapstick route rather than the working class hero theme and cynicism of 'Deeds' and 'Happy Gilmour'. He followed it up with the feel-good 'Thats my boy', a movie so silly and funny.But while I really enjoy the movie, it seems the powers-that-be behind the comedy movies these days are more about fighting traditions and being vulgar, in a kind of 'groundbreaking' (huh!) way. It's as if this movie is obsessed with being as vulgar as it can. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes off-putting.The other thing I've noticed, especially with Sandler movies, is that they tend to portray any straight and narrow middle class person as internally twisted. There's a character called 'Phil' who keeps psychotically talking about how he's only ever 'been' with his wife, before going on a spree at a strip-club. There's also a businessman in it, who actually seems kind of nice but at the end he's exposed as some cheating, exploitative creep.But if you're a lazy, booze addicted, loud-mouthed hack, like 'Donny Burger', or a pop star from 20 years ago, like Vanilla Ice, then, wallah! you're one of the good guys. You know how to live, you know how to enjoy yourself, but you're good at heart.Anyway, it's one of Sandlers funniest films, I really enjoyed it, except for those points above.

This is hands down the funniest Sandler film I've seen in the last 10 years. The story follows a 13 year old boy, who becomes a national celebrity, after he knocks up his 7th grade teacher. Fast forward 20 years and that boy is a has-been, and his son is off the radar, but that's all about to change when dad sees a wedding notice in the newspaper. The movie isn't just funny, it's actually a pretty good story, and the cameos are amazing.

Mixed in with the typical Sandler movie cameos are some very raunchy but funny scenes that as gross as they are you can't help but laugh at, at least I couldn't.

The premise is dead on.  Heck, if this was a Lifetime movie starring Skeet Ulrich in Adam Sandler's part and pretty much everyone else staying the same I woulda watched it.  So yep I checked the box for 'Premise' on the checklist.  But for a comedy almost any premise will do. It's about the laughs and the like -ability of the character.  That firefighter movie with Sandler and Kevin Whatshisname also had a great premise but where were the laughs and who liked Sandler's character?  That's My Boy-Sandler's character is a heel in the parlance of the carnies but I got a kick out of him.
