1640837,A387BD735MI50R,B00BXWIM7M,R. Schultz,"[4, 4]","Don't let the jacket of this DVD mislead you. This is not a dungeon-torture flick. Most of the action takes place in an artist's lovely loft apartment and involves more realistic relationships.It's true that this ground has been covered in many other movies, including the similarly named ""Wait Until Dark."" A blind woman is threatened by someone whose full intentions she cannot see. But this movie does include some uniquely chilling shots. Look at what happens to the family pictures on the artist's wall.The first 3/4 of the film takes its time unpeeling the extent of the villain's derangement. Then the pace of the film switches to a rather abrupt realization and resolution. It's as if the directors feared they might be running out of film and wanted to cover the essential elements of the plot as quickly as possible.Despite this final yank on the viewer's leash though, this remains a worthwhile, effective thriller. I watched several high-budget Hollywood thrillers the same week that I saw this film. Despite it's low-budget, made-for-TV production values, it won my award for the best of these new releases. It contained the most true-to-life threat and held my attention the most consistently.",4,Surprisingly Good,1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,1207,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'jacket', 'DVD', 'mislead', 'not', 'dungeon-torture', 'flick', 'Most', 'action', 'place', 'artist', 'lovely', 'loft', 'apartment', 'more', 'realistic', 'relationships.It', 'true', 'ground', 'been', 'covered', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'including', 'similarly', 'named', 'Wait', 'Dark', 'blind', 'woman', 'threatened', 'someone', 'full', 'intentions', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'include', 'uniquely', 'chilling', 'shots', 'Look', 'what', 'family', 'artist', 'wall.The', 'first', '3/4', 'film', 'time', 'unpeeling', 'extent', 'villain', 'derangement', 'Then', 'pace', 'film', 'switches', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'realization', 'resolution', 'directors', 'feared', 'might', 'be', 'running', 'film', 'wanted', 'cover', 'essential', 'elements', 'plot', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible.Despite', 'final', 'yank', 'viewer', 'leash', 'worthwhile', 'effective', 'thriller', 'watched', 'several', 'high-budget', 'Hollywood', 'thrillers', 'same', 'week', 'saw', 'film', 'low-budget', 'made-for-TV', 'production', 'values', 'won', 'award', 'best', 'new', 'releases', 'contained', 'most', 'true-to-life', 'threat', 'held', 'attention', 'most', 'consistently']",In the Dark

She gets assigned Jeff (Sam Page) to help her adjust. Jeff has spent his life with a blind mother. Jeff takes advantage of the situation and becomes a possessive voyeur.This is a well acted film, but didn't make much sense as his relationship with Ali could have escalated to another level making his sneaking around totally unnecessary. Not overly entertaining as it is slow developing and goes practically nowhere.Redbox lists this as a horror film while IMDB has it as a drama which is closer to the truth.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",3,ANOTHER TORTURED BLIND WOMAN,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,630,"['Ali', 'Lear', 'Elisabeth', 'R', 'ouml', 'hm', 'family', 'eye', 'sight', 'accident', 'assigned', 'Jeff', 'Sam', 'Page', 'help', 'adjust', 'Jeff', 'spent', 'life', 'blind', 'mother', 'Jeff', 'advantage', 'situation', 'possessive', 'voyeur.This', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'relationship', 'Ali', 'could', 'have', 'escalated', 'level', 'making', 'sneaking', 'around', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'Not', 'overly', 'entertaining', 'slow', 'developing', 'practically', 'nowhere.Redbox', 'lists', 'horror', 'film', 'IMDB', 'drama', 'closer', 'truth.Parental', 'Guide', 'f-bombs', 'sex', 'nudity']",In the Dark
