Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.Not sure what the significance is of the Oriental face on ALPHA's cover art for GREEN EYES.This Poverty Row murder mystery fails on many levels. Most egregious is John Wray's investigating cop. He hammers every interviewee (suspect, if you will) as if a member of his own family was the victim. This heavy-handed tactic goes on interminably. If I was being harrassed like that I wouldn't even tell Wray my own name. He rachets it back later, but by then you can't stand seeing him on screen.Crime scene work is laughably inconsistent. The murder weapon in Steven Kester's death is found, a letter opener, and it's passed from one hand to another without concern for fingerprints, yet later a pistol next to a ""suicide"" victim is carefully picked up by Wray with a handkerchief. Hmmm.When dull as an elbow ""hero"" Charles Starrett set himself up as the next murder victim, I kept hoping the bad guy would succeed. Shirley Grey is more watchable in any number of John Wayne 'B' westerns (orTHE HURRICANE EXPRESS) than she is here. We'll be generous and blame a bad script. Miss Grey retired from films in 1936, to concentrate on her third marriage. Her post Hollywood life was a sad one.Despite ""Green Eyes"" being from my favorite cinematic era, the early 1930s, I cannot in good faith recommend this 68 minute eternity..Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(5.4) Green Eyes (1934) - Shirley Grey/Charles Starrett/Claude Gillingwater/John Wray/William Bakewell/Dorothy Revier/Stephen Chase/Ben Hendricks Jr./Arthur Clayton/Aggie Herring/Elmer Ballard/Edward Keane",2,Whodunit?

This is a film that was made in the transition. At first you think it is too simple with a hokey sound track. Then you get wrapped up in the story and find that this is a great short and to the point who done it. The film is black and white. It sort of has that Charlie Chan feel.The story is a screen play that has the look of a stage play. It is based on a novel ""The Murder of Steven Kester"" By H. Ashbrook. Jean Kester is in the process if eloping with Michael Tracy. So people will not follow them they cut the phone lines and everyone's distributor wires. Now Jean's ruthless grandfather is found disposed of. It looks mighty suspicious.  The house is full of people that were invited to a costume party. The police gat little cooperation from any of the guests. Before the day is over it will look like everyone had motive and opportunity. We may even find a few more deaths.What part do Green eyes play in the movie?",3,"These eyes so green, I can stare for a thousand years",1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,1024,"['thirties', 'was', 'dynamic', 'decade', 'where', 'films', 'turned', 'form', 'stilted', 'simple', 'dynamic', 'depth', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'transition', 'first', 'think', 'too', 'simple', 'hokey', 'sound', 'track', 'Then', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'story', 'find', 'great', 'short', 'point', 'who', 'done', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'sort', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'feel.The', 'story', 'screen', 'play', 'look', 'stage', 'play', 'based', 'novel', 'Murder', 'Steven', 'Kester', 'H.', 'Ashbrook', 'Jean', 'Kester', 'process', 'eloping', 'Michael', 'Tracy', 'So', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'follow', 'cut', 'phone', 'lines', 'everyone', 'distributor', 'wires', 'Now', 'Jean', 'ruthless', 'grandfather', 'found', 'disposed', 'mighty', 'suspicious', 'house', 'full', 'people', 'were', 'invited', 'costume', 'party', 'police', 'gat', 'little', 'cooperation', 'guests', 'day', 'will', 'look', 'everyone', 'had', 'motive', 'opportunity', 'may', 'even', 'find', 'few', 'more', 'deaths.What', 'part', 'do', 'Green', 'eyes', 'play', 'movie']",Green Eyes

But I will have to say that ""Green Eyes"" wins the dubious ""Whoopie Cushion Award"" for being the worst Poverty Row flick I've ever suffered through.This plodding, stagy film is full of poor acting, endless dialogue, and almost no action. Charles Starrett, years away from his Durango Kid days at Columbia, is very annoying as a wisecracking crime novelist. He follows the dull and totally boring police inspector around who is trying to determine who killed the miserly owner of the mansion where a costume party is taking place.Shirley Grey sleepwalks through her role as the spoiled young relative of the old miser who threatened to cut her off in his will if she doesn't stop throwing his money away in pursuit of her wild lifestyle. She tells him that he can threaten all he wants, but she is not going to cut back on her spending. Shortly after that, he is found stabbed to death in a closet. Did Shirley commit the crime, or was it one of a long list of partygoers subjected to endless, dull interviewing by the police inspector?""Green Eyes"" is one of those films that fails to generate any interest. It was filmed at Universal City as the opening credits proudly announce, so the sets look more expensive than the usual Poverty Row film.

811415,A1JEFESGLIS076,B0001NBLWC,rsoonsa,"[1, 1]","This somewhat less than rewarding production is based closely upon a novel by Harriette Ashbrook: ""The Murder Of Steven Kester"", to a point of its inclusion of substantial swatches of Ashbrook's stilted dialogue, but since the original book remains safely confined within a rather narrow spectrum of sleuthing utilized by the English writer, it can be no surprise that the film is also dull and generally predictable.  Action opens briskly with assistant director Melville Shyer, who also contributes the script, effectively leading a congregation of extras during a lively costume party sequence, this festivity organized at the home of wealthy Steven Kester by his granddaughter Jean (Shirley Grey) as a diversion to facilitate her unobstructed elopement with beau Cliff Miller (William Bakewell).  Here the pace of the film begins to flag as journeyman director Richard Thorpe mishandles the tempo following discovery of Steven Kester's corpse, decorated with stab wounds, and a homicide investigation then begins under the supervision of Captain (or Chief, at times Inspector) Crofton (John Wray) who fails to acknowledge any recognizable form of correct investigative police procedures as he browbeats a large contingent of available suspects.  Needless to report, many of these latter have apparent motives to have committed the slaying, and if Crofton neglects one of them, a meddlesome crime novelist, Michael Tracy (Charles Starrett), a recurring lead character as ""Spike Tracy"" in the publications of Ashbrook, is on hand to abet the detective.  Viewers, however, will not require similar assistance, due to the story hardly being abstruse enough to challenge most armchair detectives.  Production values for this low tier Chesterfield Pictures item are expectedly paltry, but some performances from players are to be valued, in particular a brief turn by Lloyd Whitlock, and neatly developed characterizations from Grey and Dorothy Revier as female suspects.  Director Thorpe, ever respectful of his cast members, and especially of those whom are stage trained, leads with a loose rein.",2,Unsatisfactory Rendering Of A Novel Of The Same Stripe.,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,2097,"['somewhat', 'less', 'rewarding', 'production', 'based', 'closely', 'novel', 'Harriette', 'Ashbrook', 'Murder', 'Steven', 'Kester', 'point', 'inclusion', 'substantial', 'swatches', 'Ashbrook', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'original', 'book', 'safely', 'confined', 'rather', 'narrow', 'spectrum', 'sleuthing', 'utilized', 'English', 'writer', 'can', 'be', 'surprise', 'film', 'also', 'dull', 'generally', 'predictable', 'Action', 'briskly', 'assistant', 'director', 'Melville', 'Shyer', 'who', 'also', 'script', 'effectively', 'leading', 'congregation', 'extras', 'lively', 'costume', 'party', 'sequence', 'festivity', 'organized', 'home', 'wealthy', 'Steven', 'Kester', 'granddaughter', 'Jean', 'Shirley', 'Grey', 'diversion', 'facilitate', 'unobstructed', 'elopement', 'beau', 'Cliff', 'Miller', 'William', 'Bakewell', 'Here', 'pace', 'film', 'flag', 'journeyman', 'director', 'Richard', 'Thorpe', 'tempo', 'following', 'discovery', 'Steven', 'Kester', 'corpse', 'decorated', 'stab', 'wounds', 'homicide', 'investigation', 'then', 'supervision', 'Captain', 'Chief', 'times', 'Inspector', 'Crofton', 'John', 'Wray', 'who', 'acknowledge', 'recognizable', 'form', 'correct', 'investigative', 'police', 'procedures', 'large', 'contingent', 'available', 'suspects', 'Needless', 'report', 'many', 'latter', 'have', 'apparent', 'motives', 'have', 'committed', 'slaying', 'Crofton', 'one', 'meddlesome', 'crime', 'novelist', 'Michael', 'Tracy', 'Charles', 'Starrett', 'recurring', 'lead', 'character', 'Spike', 'Tracy', 'publications', 'Ashbrook', 'hand', 'abet', 'detective', 'Viewers', 'however', 'will', 'not', 'require', 'similar', 'assistance', 'due', 'story', 'hardly', 'being', 'abstruse', 'enough', 'challenge', 'most', 'armchair', 'detectives', 'Production', 'values', 'low', 'tier', 'Chesterfield', 'Pictures', 'item', 'are', 'expectedly', 'paltry', 'performances', 'players', 'are', 'be', 'valued', 'particular', 'brief', 'turn', 'Lloyd', 'Whitlock', 'neatly', 'developed', 'characterizations', 'Grey', 'Dorothy', 'Revier', 'female', 'suspects', 'Director', 'Thorpe', 'ever', 'respectful', 'cast', 'members', 'especially', 'whom', 'are', 'stage', 'trained', 'loose', 'rein']",Green Eyes

It was directed by the competent Richard Thorpe, who's unfortunate claim-to-fame is that he was the first director on THE WIZARD OF OZ, fired a few weeks after shooting began when his work proved unsatisfactory.Among the suspects are the murdered man's granddaughter Jean Kester, played by pretty young Shirley Grey.  The 20-something Grey would drop out of pictures in a couple of years, presumably against her wishes.  Another suspect is wise-acre crime novelist Michael Tracy, played by Charles Starrett, who would appear in scores of b-movies up through the 1950s, most notably as the Durango Kid in many b-westerns.GREEN EYES is an okay mystery that would have benefited from brisker pacing, a bit less dialogue and some less obvious `surprises' - I'm no great shakes at such things and I figured a thing or two out way too early. The transfer print quality is fair, with some wear evident on almost every frame.
