This DVD is a little more technical. The author is in a conference setting talking about what is going to happen next and he believes he will have 6 more sessions. This DVD contains the first session and talks a lot about financial ramifications. Maybe I will have a better opinion after I see all 6 sessions. Also, he does not tell you how or when the next sessions will be available. I will probably write to him or his publishers.",4,Isaiah 9:10 Very interesting,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,540,"['original', 'Harbinger', 'book', 'DVD', 'are', 'great', 'DVD', 'only', 'one', 'part', 'promise', 'more', 'DVD', 'little', 'more', 'technical', 'author', 'conference', 'setting', 'talking', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'will', 'have', '6', 'more', 'sessions', 'DVD', 'first', 'session', 'lot', 'financial', 'ramifications', 'Maybe', 'will', 'have', 'better', 'opinion', 'see', '6', 'sessions', 'Also', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'when', 'next', 'sessions', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'will', 'probably', 'write', 'publishers']",N/A
