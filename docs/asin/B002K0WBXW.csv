Now, I have no idea of their actual ages, but even the grandma in the movie (who did a great job, by the way) mentions, upon meeting her, that Sandra Bullock is no 'girl'. Ryan Reynolds' ex even seems years younger than Bullock.Now, I'm not saying that the woman must be younger than the man or anything like that. It's just that, other than Grandma's remarks, it was not something that was really brought up.  It just seemed like something that his family would have questioned, at least a little.It was still easy to see how Andrews (Reynolds) fell in love with Margaret (Bullock). I mean, he knew everything about her, almost, and learned even more during the weekend. All Bullock seemed to fall in love with was Andrew's family. She never did seem to really learn anything about him. In one scene, she finally shows some interest by asking him about his father. When Andrew refuses to answer, she talks about herself some more. I thought, ""Okay, he's finally going to open up a bit."" Nope, he just talks about her some more and that's it.The 'look' saved this movie. Both Bullock and Reynolds were able to give and get that 'look' that says, ""Oh, I think I'm falling in love with this person.""Bullock trying to feed the dog to the eagle was the absolute funniest scene in the movie. ;-)",3,Weak,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,1469,"['very', 'humorous', 'moments', 'movie', 'was', 'weak', 'romance', 'department.One', 'major', 'point', 'was', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'seemed', 'bit', 'old', 'be', 'paired', 'leading', 'man', 'Now', 'have', 'idea', 'actual', 'ages', 'even', 'grandma', 'movie', 'who', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'way', 'mentions', 'meeting', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', ""'girl"", 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'ex', 'even', 'years', 'younger', 'Bullock.Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'woman', 'must', 'be', 'younger', 'man', 'anything', 'just', 'other', 'Grandma', 'remarks', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'was', 'really', 'brought', 'up', 'just', 'seemed', 'something', 'family', 'would', 'have', 'questioned', 'least', 'little.It', 'was', 'still', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'Andrews', 'Reynolds', 'fell', 'love', 'Margaret', 'Bullock', 'mean', 'knew', 'everything', 'almost', 'learned', 'even', 'more', 'weekend', 'Bullock', 'seemed', 'fall', 'love', 'was', 'Andrew', 'family', 'never', 'did', 'seem', 'really', 'learn', 'anything', 'one', 'scene', 'finally', 'interest', 'asking', 'father', 'When', 'Andrew', 'answer', 'more', 'thought', 'Okay', 'finally', 'going', 'open', 'up', 'bit', 'Nope', 'just', 'talks', 'more', 'it.The', ""'look"", 'saved', 'movie', 'Bullock', 'Reynolds', 'were', 'able', 'give', 'get', ""'look"", 'Oh', 'think', ""'m"", 'falling', 'love', 'person', 'Bullock', 'trying', 'feed', 'dog', 'eagle', 'was', 'absolute', 'funniest', 'scene', 'movie']",N/A

1273685,A14N5L5T089VX3,B002K0WBXW,"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader""","[2, 2]","Sandra Bullock is a superb actress who knows her audience.  The type of character she plays here - a single woman with a tough if not abusive exterior persona hiding a very vulnerable, lonely interior - is played to perfection.  But then again, this is the type of character she is known-for: her ""brand.""That said, the producers of this film have chosen to play it safe rather than break new ground.  The basic storyline, themes and characters will be very familiar to Bullock fans.  You've seen them over and over again in other wonderful Bullock films, such asWhile You Were SleepingandMiss Congeniality.We do have fun, engaging performances from excellent actors such as Betty White (best known for her work in the TV series ""Golden Girls""); Craig T. Nelson (who was the voice of ""Mr. Incredible"" in the wonderful Pixar film The Incredibles [Blu-ray]); and Academy Award winner Mary Steenburgen.  Betty White's character, the grandmother of Bullock's love interest ""Andrew"" (played by Ryan Renolds), is hilarious at times: a character who is much more counter-cultural than her octagenarian exterior at first suggests.  - But then again, like Bullock's character, this is a type of role White has often had in both Film and TV in recent years - and she does an excellent job with it here.  Sadly, all of these characters could have used a bit more development in the film: they're well done, but lack depth.With one exception, there is little in this film to make it stand out from Ms. Bullock's other Romantic Comedies: the use of well known comedic actors in supporting roles, having a well known handsome hunk as the love interest, and so on, are all nothing new for Bullock - nor for Romantic Comedies in general.That one exception is the nearly nude scene between Bullock and Ryan Reynold's characters.  Other than demonstrating that Bullock has put lots of effort into maintaining a magnificent figure well into her 40's, and using just barely (sic) enough camera blocking limbs and a washcloth.  Seemingly engineered to acheive an ""R"" rating for the film, this particular scene feels very contrived.  It does little to illuminate the audience about the developing relationship between the two main characters.  The time spent here should have been used for a couple of shorter scenes devoted to that purpose.Finally I was a little disappointed by the film's purported setting in Sitka, Alaska.  I have been to Sitka, and it is a beautiful place: magnificent views of a volcano (Mt. Edgecomb) and a quirky downtown featuring a Russian Orthodox Church (the ""Cathedral of St. Michael"") smack in the middle of the town's main street.  All of this beautiful scenery is missing from the film.  The town in the film looks more like a well established, quaint and quirky New England fishing village than Sitka, which has a bit more of a ""frontier"" and ""wide open spaces"" feel to it - as I think is typical of most seaside towns in Alaska.  So, I sat through the film looking for familiar Alaskan landmarks, only to see in the credits that most of the exterior shots were, in fact, done in my home state of Massachusetts, and in Rhode Island.  --- Which means that you really are seeing a well established, quaint and quirky New England fishing village in the film, rather than Sitka.Despite all this, I had a smile on my face throughout the film.  Each time I looked over at my beloved's face, she was sporting quite a grin herself.  ""The Proposal"" is for the most part a cute and fun film.  It does a good job with a tried and true formula - just don't expect to see much that is different from what you've seen in previous Bullock films.I'll rate this film as three stars: entertaining and a good date flick; but one where the producers decided it was best to play it very safe - deliberately avoiding taking the risks that could have turned this average Romantic Comedy into a great one.",3,Playing it safe,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,3893,"['Sandra', 'Bullock', 'superb', 'actress', 'who', 'audience', 'type', 'character', 'here', 'single', 'woman', 'tough', 'not', 'abusive', 'exterior', 'persona', 'hiding', 'very', 'vulnerable', 'lonely', 'interior', 'played', 'perfection', 'then', 'again', 'type', 'character', 'known-for', 'brand', 'said', 'producers', 'film', 'have', 'chosen', 'play', 'safe', 'rather', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'basic', 'storyline', 'themes', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'familiar', 'Bullock', 'fans', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'over', 'again', 'other', 'wonderful', 'Bullock', 'films', 'such', 'Were', 'SleepingandMiss', 'Congeniality.We', 'do', 'have', 'fun', 'engaging', 'performances', 'excellent', 'actors', 'such', 'Betty', 'White', 'best', 'known', 'work', 'TV', 'series', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'who', 'was', 'voice', 'Mr', 'Incredible', 'wonderful', 'Pixar', 'film', 'Incredibles', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Betty', 'White', 'character', 'grandmother', 'Bullock', 'love', 'interest', 'Andrew', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Renolds', 'hilarious', 'times', 'character', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'counter-cultural', 'octagenarian', 'exterior', 'first', 'suggests', 'then', 'again', 'Bullock', 'character', 'type', 'role', 'White', 'often', 'had', 'Film', 'TV', 'recent', 'years', 'excellent', 'job', 'here', 'Sadly', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'development', 'film', ""'re"", 'well', 'done', 'lack', 'depth.With', 'one', 'exception', 'little', 'film', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'Ms.', 'Bullock', 'other', 'Romantic', 'Comedies', 'use', 'well', 'known', 'comedic', 'actors', 'supporting', 'roles', 'having', 'well', 'known', 'handsome', 'hunk', 'love', 'interest', 'so', 'are', 'nothing', 'new', 'Bullock', 'Romantic', 'Comedies', 'one', 'exception', 'nearly', 'nude', 'scene', 'Bullock', 'Ryan', 'Reynold', 'characters', 'Other', 'demonstrating', 'Bullock', 'put', 'lots', 'effort', 'maintaining', 'magnificent', 'figure', 'well', '40', 'using', 'just', 'barely', 'sic', 'enough', 'camera', 'blocking', 'limbs', 'washcloth', 'Seemingly', 'engineered', 'acheive', 'R', 'rating', 'film', 'particular', 'scene', 'feels', 'very', 'contrived', 'little', 'illuminate', 'audience', 'developing', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'time', 'spent', 'here', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'couple', 'shorter', 'scenes', 'devoted', 'purpose.Finally', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'film', 'purported', 'setting', 'Sitka', 'Alaska', 'have', 'been', 'Sitka', 'beautiful', 'place', 'magnificent', 'views', 'volcano', 'Mt', 'Edgecomb', 'quirky', 'downtown', 'featuring', 'Russian', 'Orthodox', 'Church', 'Cathedral', 'St.', 'Michael', 'smack', 'middle', 'town', 'main', 'street', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'missing', 'film', 'town', 'film', 'more', 'well', 'established', 'quaint', 'quirky', 'New', 'England', 'fishing', 'village', 'Sitka', 'bit', 'more', 'frontier', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'feel', 'think', 'typical', 'most', 'seaside', 'towns', 'Alaska', 'So', 'sat', 'film', 'looking', 'familiar', 'Alaskan', 'landmarks', 'only', 'see', 'credits', 'most', 'exterior', 'shots', 'were', 'fact', 'done', 'home', 'state', 'Massachusetts', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'Which', 'really', 'are', 'seeing', 'well', 'established', 'quaint', 'quirky', 'New', 'England', 'fishing', 'village', 'film', 'rather', 'Sitka.Despite', 'had', 'smile', 'face', 'film', 'time', 'looked', 'over', 'beloved', 'face', 'was', 'sporting', 'quite', 'grin', 'Proposal', 'most', 'part', 'cute', 'fun', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'tried', 'true', 'formula', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'much', 'different', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previous', 'Bullock', 'films.I', ""'ll"", 'rate', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'entertaining', 'good', 'date', 'flick', 'one', 'where', 'producers', 'decided', 'was', 'best', 'play', 'very', 'safe', 'deliberately', 'avoiding', 'taking', 'risks', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'average', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'great', 'one']",N/A

1273690,A24PTVSZSM8968,B002K0WBXW,Amazon Customer,"[3, 5]","This movie has a lot of good actors and actresses who do a decent acting job. However, the storyline seems like a collection of typical romantic movie situations cobbled together into something that isn't very meaningful.The movie is supposed to be about two people who don't get along and have an abusive one-way relationship at work, but who, through a series of events, end up falling in love. My first complaint is that Sandra Bullock is misused in this movie. She is one of my favorite actresses in romantic comedies, but she is always at her best when she's the sweet, innocent-girl type. In this movie she is supposed to be the tough, driven boss everyone hates. She never really effectively gets out of that mode and the so the eventual happy scene at the end seems a little unbelievable. My second complaint is that rather than developing a good storyline that focuses on character and relationship development between the two characters, the movie seems to go for a montage of the typical plot devices for this type of movie. There's the crazy old grandma, the conflict between dad and son over career choices, the discovery that one of the characters was really from a rich family, the scene where the two that supposedly hate each other have a forced kiss that ends up being nice, the scene where the two that hate each other accidentally end up undressed, the scene where the grandma suffers a heart attack and everyone has a change of heart, the scene where the guy realizes too late he loves the girl and goes chasing after her and the list goes on. The problem is that the movie seems to want to pile up all of the ""expected"" scenes for this type of movie rather than focusing on a meaningful story so that in the end, the happy resolution seems like it comes out of left field.The production quality and acting in the movie are pretty decent, so if you like this kind of romantic comedy this movie is probably worth taking a look at. If you are expecting a top Sandra Bullock movie that will rank up there with While You Were Sleeping or Two Week's Notice, you will probably be disappointed.",3,A tired retread with little traction.,1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,2108,"['movie', 'lot', 'good', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'do', 'decent', 'acting', 'job', 'However', 'storyline', 'collection', 'typical', 'romantic', 'movie', 'situations', 'cobbled', 'together', 'something', ""n't"", 'very', 'meaningful.The', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'have', 'abusive', 'one-way', 'relationship', 'work', 'who', 'series', 'events', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'first', 'complaint', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'misused', 'movie', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'always', 'best', 'when', 'sweet', 'innocent-girl', 'type', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'tough', 'driven', 'everyone', 'hates', 'never', 'really', 'effectively', 'mode', 'so', 'eventual', 'happy', 'scene', 'end', 'little', 'unbelievable', 'second', 'complaint', 'rather', 'developing', 'good', 'storyline', 'character', 'relationship', 'development', 'two', 'characters', 'movie', 'go', 'montage', 'typical', 'plot', 'devices', 'type', 'movie', 'crazy', 'old', 'grandma', 'conflict', 'dad', 'son', 'career', 'choices', 'discovery', 'one', 'characters', 'was', 'really', 'rich', 'family', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'supposedly', 'hate', 'other', 'have', 'forced', 'kiss', 'up', 'being', 'nice', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'hate', 'other', 'accidentally', 'end', 'up', 'undressed', 'scene', 'where', 'grandma', 'heart', 'attack', 'everyone', 'change', 'heart', 'scene', 'where', 'guy', 'too', 'late', 'girl', 'chasing', 'list', 'problem', 'movie', 'want', 'pile', 'up', 'expected', 'scenes', 'type', 'movie', 'rather', 'focusing', 'meaningful', 'story', 'so', 'end', 'happy', 'resolution', 'left', 'field.The', 'production', 'quality', 'acting', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'so', 'like', 'kind', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'movie', 'probably', 'worth', 'taking', 'look', 'are', 'expecting', 'top', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'movie', 'will', 'rank', 'there', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'Two', 'Week', 'Notice', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

This one we definitely did not like. It's not terrible and we spent a relaxed couple of hours watching it, but the storyline is trivial, the screenplay overall poor and the chemistry between the characters strangely absent. Until the end I kept thinking (hoping) that the male lead would end up making a choice different from the one he makes, but I guess that would have involved too much departure from the obvious. Really, I am still trying to figure out where the transition between hate and love took place. The main idea behind the story is also not very original (already seen in the much better ""Green Card"", with Andie McDowell and Gerard Depardieu).We only found 2 or 3 scenes convincing (for instance, without spoiling much, a late-night conversation between the two main characters) but we also found a few which were so bad and silly to be embarassing (eg one involving an eagle and another one involving a granny and an ""Indian"" dance, boh!). I am not surprised the Tomatomer only gives it about 50%.My guess is that if you liked Bullock's While You Were Sleeping (which we didn't) you are likely to enjoy this movie as well.

How can you not love her?  Sure, she may not always have the best taste in film projects, but to tell you the truth, Bullock is one of those rare actresses who can make a horrible film worth my time.  I'd watch her in anything.  Thankfully she didn't have to do much to make `The Proposal' worth my time.  Sure, the film is clich&eacute; ridden (and practically a slapstick version of her superior 95 offering `While You Were Sleeping') but it is breezy, funny and engaging.Andrew Paxton is dying to make editor at his Publishing Firm but he's stuck playing second fiddle to Margaret Tate (Bullock in full on Miranda Priestly mode).  When it becomes known that the Canadian Tate is about to be deported she makes a proposal; Paxton agree to marry her so she can stay in the states or she will destroy his career.  Despite the harsh penalties that will come if it is uncovered that this is a hoax, Paxton feels as though he has no choice but to take up her offer.  Paxton and Tate then travel to Alaska for Andrew's grandmother's birthday, and it is there, in the most beautiful place in the world (yes, seriously, I've been there...it is beyond gorgeous) they fall in love.Yeah, you knew it was going to happen.Sandra is spot on perfection here, using her infectious charm to liven up her comedic timing.  She has been better before, but she has this down to a science and has no problems getting the audience to connect.  Her chanting in the woods scene alone is worth the price of admission.  I have been hard on Ryan Renyolds before (he is often stiff, one note and ridiculously good looking, which is enough reason to hate him, let alone the fact the he is married to my dream girl) but he steps up his game here and holds his own against Bullock.  Sure, she is better than him, but is sarcastic shtick works very well with his character.The supporting cast is hit or miss, with Betty White raising the bar and becoming the most memorable part of this film (the Oscar talk his preposterous, but if it happens I'll die in supportive laughter).  Craig T. Nelson is a stereotype, but he's decent.  Oscar Nunez is effectively uncomfortable (that dance scene is just...um...nevermind) and Malin Akerman is utterly ravishing.  I really like Mary Steenburgen from time to time, but this is not one of those times.  She's just kind of meh for me.In the end I totally propose that you give `The Proposal' a try (I'm not one for puns but I couldn't resist).

You can guess from the title what's involved in their scheme. Very funny indeed. Betty White is wonderful. Sandra Bullock's dance around the fire with Betty White was hilarious. All the supporting cast was great. I thoroughly enjoyed the Alaskan setting. Also, there is no other way to say it - Ryan Reynolds is soooo hot, especially in the nude, and Sandra Bullock has done a really good job of keeping her body looking smokin', too. Their accidental naked body slam was well timed and tasteful, so the teens don't need to leave the room for any parents out there.

The result is a film that will leave you with a smile and a desire to cuddle, so watch it with someone you love!In a savvy modern gender reversal, Bullock is a brilliant, if ruthless Canadian book editor, and Reynolds is her long-suffering, but efficient secretary, forced into posing as 'engaged' when she is about to be deported. The pair so obviously are mismatched (by age...she is over a decade older...by temperment, and the fact they can't seem to agree on anything about their past), that the 'Elliot Ness' of Immigration (Denis O'Hare, in a funny turn), gives them just three days (spent at his family's home in Sitka, celebrating Granny's 90th birthday), before his interview will send Bullock back to Canada, and Reynolds to prison.In Sitka, the film really hits it's stride, as we are introduced to the fabulous Betty White (as a very spry nonogenarian) and her cute (and very put-upon) puppy, Craig T. Nelson and (a woefully underused) Mary Steenburgen as his parents, (woefully overused) Oscar Nu&ntilde;ez as the local 'jack-of-all-trades', and Malin Akerman as Reynolds' ex-girlfriend. While some situations are expected, under the circumstances (a shared bedroom and accidental nude...VERY nude...encounter, and a 'baby maker' quilt that always seems to be a prop in films involving ethnic cultures), we also get to really know the quiet Reynolds (who is a gifted writer struggling against a father who had already blueprinted his entire life), and the reason for Bullock's attitude (living on her own since a teen, and overachieving to compensate for a lack of love). While the frequent moments of slapstick are hilarious (the poor dog, a hungry eagle, and panic-stricken Bullock's stolen cellphone is a high point), the character development gives the film 'heart', and makes the growing affection between the pair not only believable, but something to cheer about.In this kind of film, you KNOW everything will turn out all right (what kind of date movie would it be, if it didn't?), but there are a few novel twists to keep things interesting!""The Proposal"" is a winner!",5,"Genuinely Funny, a Great Date Movie!",1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,2498,"['theme', 'Anne', 'Fletcher', 'Proposal', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'terrific', 'film', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'stay', 'America', 'was', 'Green', 'Card', 'few', 'years', 'back', ""'take"", 'benefit', 'two', 'most', 'attractive', 'likable', 'stars', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'genuinely', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'beautiful', 'Boston', 'North', 'Shore', 'substituting', 'Sitka', 'Alaska', 'result', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'smile', 'desire', 'cuddle', 'watch', 'someone', 'love', 'savvy', 'modern', 'gender', 'reversal', 'Bullock', 'brilliant', 'ruthless', 'Canadian', 'book', 'editor', 'Reynolds', 'long-suffering', 'efficient', 'secretary', 'forced', 'posing', ""'engaged"", 'when', 'be', 'deported', 'pair', 'so', 'obviously', 'are', 'mismatched', 'age', 'decade', 'older', 'temperment', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'agree', 'anything', 'past', ""'Elliot"", 'Ness', 'Immigration', 'Denis', ""O'Hare"", 'funny', 'turn', 'just', 'three', 'days', 'spent', 'family', 'home', 'Sitka', 'celebrating', 'Granny', '90th', 'birthday', 'interview', 'will', 'send', 'Bullock', 'back', 'Canada', 'Reynolds', 'prison.In', 'Sitka', 'film', 'really', 'stride', 'are', 'introduced', 'fabulous', 'Betty', 'White', 'very', 'spry', 'nonogenarian', 'cute', 'very', 'put-upon', 'puppy', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'woefully', 'underused', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'parents', 'woefully', 'overused', 'Oscar', 'Nu', 'ntilde', 'local', ""'jack-of-all-trades"", 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'Reynolds', 'ex-girlfriend', 'situations', 'are', 'expected', 'circumstances', 'shared', 'bedroom', 'accidental', 'nude', 'VERY', 'nude', 'encounter', ""'baby"", 'maker', 'quilt', 'always', 'be', 'prop', 'films', 'involving', 'ethnic', 'cultures', 'also', 'get', 'really', 'know', 'quiet', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'gifted', 'writer', 'struggling', 'father', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'blueprinted', 'entire', 'life', 'reason', 'Bullock', 'attitude', 'living', 'own', 'teen', 'overachieving', 'compensate', 'lack', 'love', 'frequent', 'moments', 'slapstick', 'are', 'hilarious', 'poor', 'dog', 'hungry', 'eagle', 'panic-stricken', 'Bullock', 'stolen', 'cellphone', 'high', 'point', 'character', 'development', 'film', ""'heart"", 'growing', 'affection', 'pair', 'not', 'only', 'believable', 'something', 'cheer', 'about.In', 'kind', 'film', 'KNOW', 'everything', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'right', 'what', 'kind', 'date', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'are', 'few', 'novel', 'twists', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'Proposal', 'winner']",N/A

Dravis ""BETTY DRAVIS, author/reviewer""","[2, 2]","Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite female stars, so it was no surprise that she gave a fine performance as Margaret inThe Proposal (Single Disc Widescreen). She's a lovely, likable person in real life and was perfect casting for this role of a New York editor who blackmails her assistant (Andrew, played by Ryan Reynolds) into proposing to her so she can avoid deportation to Canada. Turn-about being fair play, he then blackmails her for a promotion. Although she's a workaholic and a demanding boss, she's really a sweet, mixed-up young woman; blackmail is out of character for her, but she's desperate...When Andrew takes her to his parent's mansion in Alaska to meet them, they're surprised when he announces they're getting married. The trip is a ruse to convince the deportation officer of the sincerity of the engagement.The women in the family (mother, played by Mary Steenburgen, and grandmother, Betty White) treat Margaret with utmost respect and learn to love her. Having never enjoyed life with a close-knit family, Margaret develops strong feelings for them. And in the course of staying in their home, she learns what a great guy Andrew really is.Predictably, Margaret and Andrew develop feelings for each other, yet neither will admit it, preferring to spar instead. The family dog causes most of the hilarious scenes between the couple, not to mention Andrew's lovable grandmother. (Who doesn't love the irrepressible Betty White, still a scene-stealer at 87?)The only hold-out is Andrew's father who is disappointed in his son for not following in his footsteps; he tries to thwart their plans by conniving with the deportation officer.This romantic comedy has several unexpected twists and turns, and you'll never believe what happens on the day of the wedding! But Betty White saves the day by pulling some high-jinx of her own.All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. Comedy + Drama + Sandra Bullock = Feel-good movie!

Bullock is one of the best book editors in the business, and also a total tyrant. And she's Canadian. Reynolds has been her assistant for three years and suffers all kind of abuse in order to learn from the best and in hopes of getting a promotion to editor. The problem comes in Bullock is facing being deported to Canada. She quickly thinks of a solution and says she and Reynolds are engaged to be married. Now, they have the weekend to learn everything about each other before being quizzed by the supsicious immigraiton agent.The opening of the movie is great, setting up the character of the tyrant editor and the put upon assistant perfectly. But the movie changes completely when Bullock and Reynolds travel to his home in Alaska for his grandma's birthday. Suddenly, she isn't the tyrant boss anymore, but instead the surprise girlfriend. And Reynolds is now the star. His family is super rich and all everyone is happy to see him. All the romantic comedy plot devices are there, from the quirky relatives, the ex-girlfriend, and the moment of clarity where the characters realize they have to be together.I enjoyed the movie because of Bullock and Reynolds, but the script and plot did them no favors. The supporting cast of Mary Steenburgen, Craig Nelson and Betty White were at times funny and at times cringe worthy (Betty White).

1273718,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B002K0WBXW,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 2]","Although entertaining to a point, there are too many similarities to other comedies to make THE PROPOSAL anything but ordinary.Most notably I found the plot to be very similar to another, older Sandra Bullock movie,While You Were Sleeping. But this time we have an accomplice in the deceit and he's not in a coma. Seriously. Think about it...A woman who is in need of something (in this case a need NOT to be deported) comes up with a plan to achieve that goal (whether by accident -While You Were Sleeping- or not - The Proposal). Girl falls for the wrong guy. Guy falls for wrong girl. Family gets fooled. Girl confesses and thinks she's lost everything. Guy chases down girl with the approval of the family. Everyone lives happily ever after. Ta-da!The entertainment value in the film comes from the first half of the movie in which we have plenty of comedic zingers flying about, including quite a few from Grandma Annie (Betty White) while trying to dress Margaret (Sandra Bullock,The Lake House) in a wedding dress and losing - then finding - her breasts.The cast is good in their respective roles, including main love interest Ryan Reynolds (Smokin' Aces) playing Andrew Paxton, a sort of rich boy playing poor boy in order to tick-off his father, Joe, played by Craig T. Nelson (The Family Stone). Nelson just seems to be going through the motions during the entire film and never really gains any traction. As does Mary Steenburgen (The Dead Girl) who plays Reynold's mother.The other problem with the casting is that we just don't get that romantic air between Bullock and Reynolds' characters. She is obviously much older than him (can you say ""cougar?""), which isn't always a problem but, again, there just didn't seem much attraction going on. They fight, argue and never really resolve anything before miraculously falling in love ...because of one kiss?Let's get real...Even with these flaws, the comedic timing is excellent and the visual backdrops of Boston and the (supposed) Alaskan countryside can take one's breath away.

It has all the right ingredients:  funny, amazing chemistry, beautiful people, hilarious family, perfect plot and did I say funny?

I've been eyeing this actor since the ""Two Guys and a Girl"" days and he is truly the new comic 'it' man.  I can't really think of any old timers to compare him with - but I think he is in the same league as John Krasinski, another fine comedian/actor of this generation.

Unfortunately, her film choices have not always been the best. This may not be the case with ""The Proposal,"" a charming and feel-good romantic comedy which showcases Bullock's full range.Bullock is Margaret Tate, a powerful publishing executive, who is feared by her employees. She is tough and doesn't hesitate to fire people when she doesn't get results. Ryan Reynolds is Andrew Paxton, her assistant, who has been at her service long enough to understand and read her every wish well. The order of things drastically change when, one day, she is informed by her superiors that she will be fired because she is an illegal immigrant - she is Canadian -- working in the United States, which makes her eligible for deportation. Being a smart lady, she thinks fast and immediately tells her bosses that Andrew is her boyfriend, and that they are planning to get married. Andrew, who is taken by surprise, reluctantly accepts. Margaret blackmails him by telling him that he will never be promoted to editor if he doesn't marry her. Andrew, of course, is no fool and also takes advantage of the situation. They will end up in Alaska, visiting Andrew's relatives, because oh his grandmother's birthday. Hell will break loose while there, and many surprises will lie ahead.""The Proposal"" is very entertaining and well-meaning, aided by a supporting cast that includes Mary Steenburgen, Betty White and Craig T.

She is the boss lady and her visa is up so she needs to either marry an American or be deported.  Naturally, the latter is not to her liking so she enlists the (unwilling) assistance of her assistant.  As part of the ploy they have to visit his family for his grandmother's birthday (played by Betty White).  At first his family is a little too country for the sophisticated boss lady but as she gets to know them, she takes another look at her too structured and perfect life and decides that she likes them.

Mom""","[2, 2]","The Proposal is one of those agreeably amusing, old-fashioned kind of assemble- by-the-numbers romances which were churned out by the hundreds in the old studio days, of the 1930's and 40's. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing depends on if old-fashioned romantic comedies appeals to you: if it does, than this release can be relished like a box of your favorite Godiva chocolates. You know what you are getting, you will enjoy every bite, and you probably won't regret having spent the time. Sandra Bullock stars as Margaret, the hard-driving book editor, who lives her workaholic life in such a fashion that - as the saying goes - when her feet hit the ground of a morning, the Devil himself says ""Oh, s**t, she's awake!"" Which, it is made clear, is about what her frazzled, yet hunky assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds)and the rest of the office is thinking. Yet, Margaret has a problem - she's Canadian, and her immigration status is questionable. Under threat of immediate deportation, (Shades of Green Card!) she claims that she and Andrew are engaged to marry. Immigration problem solved. Or maybe not: she and Andrew have to make at least a good pretense of it, especially for a trip back to his hometown of Sitka, Alaska for a family event, with Mom (Mary Steenburgen) Dad, (Craig T. Nelson) and Granny (Betty White). All of Andrew's family and friends are thrilled to the core that he is intending to marry, and joyously welcome Margaret ... and now the two of them have to put on a show for the family as well. Will Granny be blunt and conniving, and succeed in dragging Margaret to a bachelorette party featuring the only male stripper in Sitka? Yeah, this is Betty White we are talking about. Will Margaret's outer shrew be tamed? Does it end happily? Well, of course. Duh. My only unanswered questions are - Is Sitka really that incredibly scenic?

1273749,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002K0WBXW,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 6]","If you don't know how ""The Proposal"" will turn out before entering the theater, maybe you're better off because it means you haven't seen as many romantic comedies as I have. I, unfortunately, know the formula like the back of my hand. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad movie, of course, but it does make it a lot harder to get into. Imagine, if you will, two people at opposite ends of the personality spectrum; she's a pushy boss, and he's her lowly personal assistant. Now imagine that they find themselves in close contact for a couple of days, and during that time, they discover that they do, in fact, love each other. Honestly, it doesn't take a degree in cinema to figure this one out. Thankfully, ""The Proposal"" manages to be halfway decent in spite of its overused formula. I'm not quite recommending it, but still, there are worse films out there (""My Life in Ruins"" very quickly comes to mind).The pushy boss is Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock), who works for a publishing house in New York City. Actually, she's more like the boss from hell, not so much because she's demanding but because she's incredibly mean-spirited, pointing out personal faults that have no business being pointed out. Her lowly personal assistant is Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds), a driven young man with a manuscript he wants published. In the course of fifteen minutes, Margaret fires a prominent employee, bullies a reclusive author into appearing on ""Oprah,"" and orders Andrew to work over the weekend. It doesn't matter to her that he was supposed to go home to Alaska that same weekend for his grandmother's ninetieth birthday.The crux of the story: Margaret, a Canadian immigrant, has just learned from her superiors that her visa has expired, which means she'll have to leave the company and be deported. Desperate to stay on top, she blackmails Andrew into pretending that he's her fianc&eacute;. He goes along with it, but only on the condition that he be promoted to an editorial position. They then have to convince an immigration agent (Denis O'Hare) that they're not committing fraud, so they say that they will be going to Alaska over the weekend and surprise Andrew's family with the good news (Margaret's family is conveniently not in the picture). At this point, they agree that it's strictly a business deal; they will get divorced as soon as they possibly can and move on with their lives.In Alaska, Margaret is shocked to learn that Andrew is from a very affluent family. Here enters his accommodating mother, Grace (Mary Steenburgen), his kooky but loveable grandmother, Annie (Betty White), and his disapproving father, Joe (Craig T. Nelson), who wanted him to stay in Alaska and take over the family business.The ensuing scenes of Margaret and Andrew fooling everyone around them don't generate big laughs, although their sarcastic verbal jabs are effective. I also admit that they share more than a few smirk-inducing physical moments, such as when they bump into each other and fall over when they happen to be completely naked. There's also a point at which he's forced to get into bed with her because his mother is at the door and wants to serve them breakfast; as they frantically position themselves in a loving pose, Margaret is rudely reminded of what happens to a man's body when he wakes up in the morning. Some of the amusement is balanced with one or two touching moments, as when Margaret lies in bed and tells Andrew facts about herself. I won't rattle off a list, but I will say that she isn't as immune to character attacks as she makes herself out to be.But for every decent scene, there are at least three others that aren't very good at all. There's a subplot, for example, involving a character named Ramone (Oscar Nu&ntilde;ez), who seems to do a little bit of everything in this small Alaska town. When he's not a caterer, he's a minister. And when he's not a minister, he's a shop owner. And when he's not a shop owner, he's a male stripper. We know he's a male stripper because Grace and Annie decide to take Margaret to one of his shows as a surprise. Is there any such thing as Amateur Night at a Chippendale club? There's also a painfully unfunny scene in which Margaret goes off into the woods and spots Annie performing a chanting ritual around a fire pit; Margaret, encouraged to chant along, performs a profanity-laced rap solo.Tension mounts when, on a whim, Andrew's family decides that his wedding should take place during his visit, specifically on Annie's birthday. Can Andrew and Margaret go through with it knowing it's a sham? Will Margaret be able to reconcile her growing feelings for Andrew? Will Annie be able to alter her old wedding dress to accommodate Margaret's less-than-ample [...]? As I already said, I knew the answers to these questions before entering the theater, and I'm sure most audiences are in the exact same situation. I shouldn't criticize a film for achieving exactly what it wanted to achieve, but really, this romantic comedy formula is getting very old. No, ""The Proposal"" isn't an all-out bad film, but it is grossly unoriginal, and it's filled with jokes that are amusing but hardly hilarious.",3,"Marry Me, or Else!",1244937600,"06 14,

She forces her assistant to lie to immigration and state that they are soon to married. Immigration is more than a little suspicious of the arrangement, so to help convince everyone Ryan Reynolds and Bullock take a trip to Alaska to meet Reynolds family.

Nelson, Mary Steenburgen, Betty White, Dennis O'Hare, Malin Akerman and Oscar NunezWRITTEN BY: Pete ChiarelliDIRECTED BY: Anne FletcherRated: PG-13Genre: Romantic ComedyRelease Date: 19 June 2009The Proposal was easily one of the best romantic comedies of the year and only gets better with a second viewing.Sandra Bullock stars as an absolute tyrant of a boss, named Margaret Tate. I didn't even have to use [...] to verify this was her name, because I vividly remember her co-star Ryan Reynolds quoting it, so humorously in the film.Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton and there is only one thing in the world keeping him from achieving his dream of being an editor: Margaret Tate. While she will never admit it, she knows he is the best personal assistant she could ever hope to find. Thus, she neglects to ever award him with even so much as the slightest bit of praise.That's all about to change however, when Margaret is threatened to be deported back to Canada; disqualifying her eligibility to work for an American company.The screenwriter brilliantly has Andrew step into the room during this unfortunate meeting, to relay a message to Margaret with the word `proposal' attached. A light bulb goes off and Margaret drags Andrew into the meeting, informing her employers she and Andrew are to be married, that very weekend.Andrew's reaction to hearing this is hilarious as he realizes she will crush him if he does not go along. The scene only gets funnier from there, when they ask Andrew where the wedding will be held and Margaret is shocked to realize they are going to - Alaska, of all places.Finally, Andrew is in a place to negotiate for a promotion to editor. He threatens to walk from pretending to be Margaret's fianc&eacute;, unless he's promoted to editor. Margaret regrettably agrees and their employer tells her all will be forgotten once they are married.All they have to do is convince Andrew's family and a pesky customs and integrations official who is tracking their every move, that the wedding is legit.The movie is cleverly written and directed and has some great scenes that move us and make us smile. In particularly, the scenes involving Margaret interacting with Andrew's family, who consists of great performances by Craig T. Nelson, Betty White and Mary Steenburgen. Everyone has amazing chemistry together, and the characters are portrayed wonderfully.Even though I am a guy, I can admit this is a funny flick that any dude with substance, will enjoy watching on the couch with his lady.",5,The Proposal Review,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,2580,"['PROPOSALSTARRING', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Betty', 'White', 'Dennis', ""O'Hare"", 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'Oscar', 'NunezWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Pete', 'ChiarelliDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Anne', 'FletcherRated', 'PG-13Genre', 'Romantic', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '19', 'June', '2009The', 'Proposal', 'was', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'year', 'only', 'better', 'second', 'viewing.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'absolute', 'tyrant', 'boss', 'named', 'Margaret', 'Tate', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'use', '[', ']', 'verify', 'was', 'name', 'vividly', 'remember', 'co-star', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'quoting', 'so', 'humorously', 'film.Reynolds', 'Andrew', 'Paxton', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'world', 'keeping', 'achieving', 'dream', 'being', 'editor', 'Margaret', 'Tate', 'will', 'never', 'admit', 'best', 'personal', 'assistant', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'find', 'Thus', 'ever', 'award', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'slightest', 'bit', 'praise.That', 'change', 'however', 'when', 'Margaret', 'threatened', 'be', 'deported', 'back', 'Canada', 'disqualifying', 'eligibility', 'work', 'American', 'company.The', 'screenwriter', 'brilliantly', 'Andrew', 'step', 'room', 'unfortunate', 'meeting', 'relay', 'message', 'Margaret', 'word', 'proposal', 'attached', 'light', 'bulb', 'off', 'Margaret', 'Andrew', 'meeting', 'informing', 'employers', 'Andrew', 'are', 'be', 'married', 'very', 'weekend.Andrew', 'reaction', 'hearing', 'hilarious', 'will', 'crush', 'not', 'go', 'along', 'scene', 'only', 'funnier', 'there', 'when', 'ask', 'Andrew', 'where', 'wedding', 'will', 'be', 'held', 'Margaret', 'shocked', 'realize', 'are', 'going', 'Alaska', 'places.Finally', 'Andrew', 'place', 'negotiate', 'promotion', 'editor', 'walk', 'pretending', 'be', 'Margaret', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'promoted', 'editor', 'Margaret', 'regrettably', 'employer', 'will', 'be', 'forgotten', 'are', 'married.All', 'have', 'do', 'convince', 'Andrew', 'family', 'pesky', 'customs', 'integrations', 'official', 'who', 'tracking', 'move', 'wedding', 'legit.The', 'movie', 'cleverly', 'written', 'directed', 'great', 'scenes', 'move', 'make', 'smile', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Margaret', 'interacting', 'Andrew', 'family', 'who', 'great', 'performances', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Betty', 'White', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Everyone', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'together', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'am', 'guy', 'can', 'admit', 'funny', 'flick', 'dude', 'substance', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'couch', 'lady']",N/A

Want to see DEPTH, front to back, with layers of foreground, middle and background, including, what are those, silhouettes of the Twin Towers on the window?The first half hour or so of this movie is a marvel, and must be seen by ANY student of the visual arts, of any visual art, to learn composition as it must be done.Then, when they leave the office, turn off not only the sound, but the film as a whole, and walk away, or replay this opening sequence, inside the office, brilliantly done.The rest, as they say, goes directly, swiftly into the toilet: cinematography, storyline, dialog, &#34;acting,&#34; direction, characterization, everything, everything, fast, and furiously, at break neck Speed [Blu-ray].SPOILER ALERT: Sandra Bullock not only stars in what so swiftly becomes an unwatchable turkey, she also served herself as producer, which explains everything, which explains why it goes so very badly so quickly. Watch ONLY the first half hour with the SOUND TURNED OFF!Ok, so, like, they go a small island in Alaska, right? SO why does it look just like a mansion on eastern Long Island, back in, you know, New York, and all of the people as well, look and dress and act like shallow, pampered, wealthy Long Islanders?How did this young man from somewhere in the Alaskan wild ever get a job as an office manager in Manhattan? What, no competent Manhattanites?And this is only the start of the killing questions hinting at the total MELT-DOWN which takes place once they leave the office.Best, if you MUST see this movie for some weird reason, bask in the opening half hour, or so, with the SOUND WELL OFF, enjoying, really, truly, the excellent visual composition, such as we rarely see in film anymore, and then, with respect, TURN IT OFF AND BACK AWAY!The Horror, the horror, the horror! . . .marvelous to SEE the first section, inside the office, but then IMMEDIATELY becomes THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!

1273766,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B002K0WBXW,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[6, 8]","A pleasant, sweet, predictable movie about a nasty boss, Margaret Tate (don't call her anything but Margaret), that corners her assistant, Andrew Paxton; into marrying her so she won't be deported. You see, she is Canadian, and was too busy with her career to file the right immigration papers. So she must marry an American. What follows is standard classic romantic comedy that has been replicated thousands of times, starting back in the forties.This would be an awful movie if it weren't for the performances, starting with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, and ending with Mary Steenburg and Betty White. Sandra Bullock is absolutely radiant, she is losing that bland white bread acting that she perfected in Speed (Speed (Widescreen Edition)). Since marrying Jesse James, she has acquired some style and spice in everything she does, (witness her recent appearance on the George Lopez show getting a Latina makeover). In the first half of The Proposal, she is rude and demanding, and never gives a sense of reading her lines or stumbling on ad libs. Ryan Reynolds plays the smart, driven assistant, with shades of Van Wilder (National Lampoon's Van Wilder - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)). It's a decent combination. They both have honed their bodies to near perfection. There is a completely nude scene (with no private parts ever shown) that shows off both of their incredible bodies, all will be very happy with this scene.Betty White plays Grandma Annie, and moves between crazy funny old lady, doting grandmother, and minx. There are few moments where Betty delivers some flat lines, but overall she is funny. Mary Steenburg is the perfect accepting loving mother. She understands exactly how to put her husband Craig T. Nelson in his place. Actually, aside from Ryan Reynolds, the male characters are mostly throw away roles. Oscar Nu&ntilde;ez, (Oscar the gay accountant on the Office), plays, a cringe inducing waiter, stripper, clerk, and clergyman. Most everyone will want to close their eyes, or fast forward, when they hear the song, Relax by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Trust me; you might want to scratch your eyes out if you watch it.Although the movie is predictable, I like the His Girl Friday role reversal twist, the chemistry between Ryan and Sandra, and the scenery. So overall this is a funny worthwhile film. The first half is the strongest. There is a difficult transition at about half way, which lingers for about 20 minutes.There's one thing that I really didn't care for. Something felt a bit wrong about the location of the film, it's supposed to be Sitka, Alaska; and New York City. I listened to some of the alternate soundtrack with director and producer commentary. It turns out the darn thing was filmed entirely in Massachusetts, in and around Boston. All the beautiful scenery was added digitally. I actually feel cheated by the director. And a quick Google Images view, it's clear that this film has nothing whatsoever to do with Sitka, a far more gorgeous town than was ever portrayed in the film. It's sad that the screenwriter and director could not come up with a real town to film, instead of the totally made up one they used. Northern Maine is equally remote. Sorry, I felt cheated by this fact.The film is an hour and forty eight minutes long, of which, 20 minutes could have been easily removed and made the film tighter. The film is rated PG-13. It's a very chaste film. There's a silly joke about morning wood, the previously mentioned naked scene, and a 'Chippendale' scene where a man ends up in a Speedo. Otherwise, it is a mild PG-13. Not much strong language. No violence. I don't even remember much drinking.There's a single special feature, the director commentary. That soundtrack is kind of whiney, and rambling. Sandra Bullock gets called Sandy throughout. And there's a long monologue about Betty White. All the outtakes were played during the credits, very silly Disney like.Role reversal His Girl Friday. I think this makes a decent date movie. There are enough funny jokes and Sandra Bullock to keep men interested.

Sandra Bullock has played this type of part (the workaholic, all-consuming business professional) dozens of times before, and Ryan Reynolds has ten stages of annoying (in this role he is at stage six; no, make that seven); yet the premise is cute enough:  Bullock's character is in danger of being deported back to Canada, so to avoid this little dilemma she strong-arms her apprehensive assistant (Reynolds) into a faux engagement.  And to further dig themselves into a hole before a suspicious federal agent (Denis O'Hare), the would-be couple announces they will be heading for the weekend to introduce the would-be bride to the would-be groom's real life family--in Alaska (more on that later).  Once the story shifts there, the deception is further layered, before it unravels--yet (who would've thunk!) both protagonists suddenly realize they are hopelessly in luv.It's cute (like I said), and there are some giggle moments, and the venerable Betty White is constantly rushed in to say the choice one-liners (playing Reynolds' grandma), yet there's nothing here to offer a new twist or unique plot shift to keep THE PROPOSAL from rushing headlong towards its predictable ending.  Speaking of annoying, what in the world is Oscar Nunez doing in this picture?  (Besides annoying us?)

1273795,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B002K0WBXW,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","2009's &#34;The Proposal&#34; features Sandra Bullock as Margaret Tate, the inconsiderate and career-driven senior editor of a New York City publishing house. When the Canadian-born Margaret is suddenly faced with deportation for lack of a visa, she announces a surpise engagement to her much put-upon executive assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds). The price of Andrew's cooperation is a promotion and a weekend with his family in his hometown of Sitka, Alaska.What could easily have been a formulaic romantic comedy becomes highly entertaining, thanks to the excellent on-screen chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Their verbal sparring is only one highlight of Margaret's hilarious &#34;fish out of water&#34; weekend in Alaska. Margaret will discover that Andrew has a tight-knit if tumultuous family (Craig T. Nelson, Mary Steenbergen, and the scene-stealing Betty White), an attractive ex-girlfriend (Malin Ackerman), and surprising depth of character. Offered the opportunity for a quick family wedding, Margaret will suffer a sudden and fateful attack of conscience.Massachusetts is a somewhat less than convincing stand-in for Alaska, but the writers work in some appropriate jokes about the long summer days, convoluted transportation, and the hazards of being a small dog in Alaska. The story pacing allows Margaret and Andrew to discover each other, but not too fast, while working through such challenges as ad-libbing their marriage proposal story on the fly for Andrew's family and friends.&#34;The Proposal&#34; is highly recommended as good fun for romantic comedy fans.

1273797,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002K0WBXW,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 6]","Even though it so clearly apes the set-up of David Frankel'sThe Devil Wears Prada, I think the first 25 minutes of this 2009 romantic comedy has genuine snap enhanced by the sharp comedy interplay between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Once the story leaves the Manhattan publishing house for the pastoral wilderness of Alaska, the story reverts into a formulaic sitcom bearing more than a passing resemblance to Bullock's break-out vehicle, 1995'sWhile You Were Sleeping, including an escalation of comic deceptions and a heart-tugging wedding confessional. Give credit to the fortyish actress/producer for not giving in too much to standard ing&eacute;nue behavior this time. In fact, she plays the alpha dog with Reynolds relegated to the traditional leading lady role. The result produces enough contrived shenanigans to please Bullock's diehard fans thanks to by-the-numbers work by director Anne Fletcher (27 Dresses) and first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli.The storyline has Bullock playing vituperative book editor Margaret Tate, a workaholic careerist who instills fear into her entire office. As her bullied assistant Andrew Paxton, Reynolds caters to her every whim in the hopes that she will help boost his publishing career. As is typical for an opposites-attract rom-com, a complication occurs when Margaret, a Canadian, finds out she is to be deported because her visa application has been denied. Instead of facing immediate termination, she manipulates Andrew to let her superiors know that they are getting married. This moment of desperate deceit leads to an awkward visit with an immigration agent who senses a green-card arrangement and requires proof of their relationship. In order to avert suspicion, Margaret accompanies Andrew to visit his close-knit family in Sitka, Alaska, where it is revealed his family is quite wealthy and in fact, run many of the businesses in town.They continue their charade of being engaged, which of course, fans the flames of his family's enthusiasm for a wedding. The rest of the film is pretty much what you would expect save a strange episode of Andrew's grandmother performing a native dance in the woods. It's funny to see how Bullock cleverly uses the same prickliness she displayed effectively in her near-cameo in Paul Haggis'Crashin this film's establishing scenes as Margaret. In turn, Reynolds shows smart timing as put-upon Andrew, and their interplay has a nice edge. Note how well they perform during the best scenes early on when Margaret baldly lies about their upcoming nuptials at the office and in front of the immigration officer. It's just when they move into more traditional rom-com territory where their chemistry feels weakened and the sparks doused. Chiarelli's haphazard screenplay doesn't help them as they have little beyond one bedtime confessional scene to make us think they may belong together. Craig T. Nelson plays a familiar role as Andrew's disapproving father, but their subplot weighs down the proceedings unnecessarily.Except for one brief face-off with Nelson, Mary Steenburgen is wasted as Andrew's always-smiling mother. Betty White is a welcome sight as feisty Grandma Annie, although I wish the creators could have made her more like Sue Ann Nivens (The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and less like Rose Nylund (The Golden Girls). As the girl Andrew left behind in Sitka, Malin Akerman (Watchmen) is actually left stranded by the script, while Oscar Nu&ntilde;ez (The Office) grows increasingly tiresome as store clerk/male stripper Ramone. His absurd club performance, along with a nude run-in between the principals, just shows how little faith the creators had in the material to sustain the plot. Standard extras come with the 2009 DVD: a decent commentary track from Fletcher and Chiarelli (but sadly not the actors), seven minutes of outtakes, two deleted scenes of little interest, and an alternate ending which really just switches the locale versus the resolution.",3,Starts Off with Snap and Verve But Moves Soon Enough Into Predictable Rom-Com Territory,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,3977,"['Even', 'so', 'clearly', 'set-up', 'David', ""Frankel'sThe"", 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'think', 'first', '25', 'minutes', '2009', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genuine', 'snap', 'enhanced', 'sharp', 'comedy', 'interplay', 'stars', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'story', 'Manhattan', 'publishing', 'house', 'pastoral', 'wilderness', 'Alaska', 'story', 'formulaic', 'sitcom', 'bearing', 'more', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'Bullock', 'break-out', 'vehicle', ""1995'sWhile"", 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'including', 'escalation', 'comic', 'deceptions', 'heart-tugging', 'wedding', 'confessional', 'Give', 'credit', 'fortyish', 'actress/producer', 'not', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'standard', 'ing', 'eacute', 'behavior', 'time', 'fact', 'alpha', 'dog', 'Reynolds', 'relegated', 'traditional', 'leading', 'lady', 'role', 'result', 'enough', 'contrived', 'shenanigans', 'please', 'Bullock', 'diehard', 'fans', 'thanks', 'by-the-numbers', 'work', 'director', 'Anne', 'Fletcher', '27', 'Dresses', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'Pete', 'Chiarelli.The', 'storyline', 'Bullock', 'playing', 'vituperative', 'book', 'editor', 'Margaret', 'Tate', 'workaholic', 'careerist', 'who', 'fear', 'entire', 'office', 'bullied', 'assistant', 'Andrew', 'Paxton', 'Reynolds', 'caters', 'whim', 'hopes', 'will', 'help', 'boost', 'publishing', 'career', 'typical', 'opposites-attract', 'rom-com', 'complication', 'when', 'Margaret', 'Canadian', 'out', 'be', 'deported', 'visa', 'application', 'been', 'denied', 'Instead', 'facing', 'immediate', 'termination', 'Andrew', 'let', 'superiors', 'know', 'are', 'getting', 'married', 'moment', 'desperate', 'deceit', 'awkward', 'visit', 'immigration', 'agent', 'who', 'green-card', 'arrangement', 'proof', 'relationship', 'order', 'avert', 'suspicion', 'Margaret', 'Andrew', 'visit', 'close-knit', 'family', 'Sitka', 'Alaska', 'where', 'revealed', 'family', 'quite', 'wealthy', 'fact', 'run', 'many', 'businesses', 'town.They', 'continue', 'charade', 'being', 'engaged', 'course', 'flames', 'family', 'enthusiasm', 'wedding', 'rest', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'save', 'strange', 'episode', 'Andrew', 'grandmother', 'performing', 'native', 'dance', 'woods', 'funny', 'see', 'how', 'Bullock', 'cleverly', 'same', 'prickliness', 'displayed', 'effectively', 'near-cameo', 'Paul', ""Haggis'Crashin"", 'film', 'establishing', 'scenes', 'Margaret', 'turn', 'Reynolds', 'smart', 'timing', 'put-upon', 'Andrew', 'interplay', 'nice', 'edge', 'Note', 'how', 'well', 'perform', 'best', 'scenes', 'early', 'when', 'Margaret', 'baldly', 'upcoming', 'nuptials', 'office', 'front', 'immigration', 'officer', 'just', 'when', 'move', 'more', 'traditional', 'rom-com', 'territory', 'where', 'chemistry', 'feels', 'weakened', 'sparks', 'doused', 'Chiarelli', 'haphazard', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'help', 'have', 'little', 'one', 'bedtime', 'confessional', 'scene', 'make', 'think', 'may', 'belong', 'together', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'familiar', 'role', 'Andrew', 'disapproving', 'father', 'subplot', 'down', 'proceedings', 'one', 'brief', 'face-off', 'Nelson', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'wasted', 'Andrew', 'always-smiling', 'mother', 'Betty', 'White', 'welcome', 'sight', 'feisty', 'Grandma', 'Annie', 'wish', 'creators', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'Nivens', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'less', 'Rose', 'Nylund', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'girl', 'Andrew', 'left', 'behind', 'Sitka', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'Watchmen', 'actually', 'left', 'stranded', 'script', 'Oscar', 'Nu', 'ntilde', 'Office', 'increasingly', 'tiresome', 'store', 'clerk/male', 'stripper', 'Ramone', 'absurd', 'club', 'performance', 'nude', 'run-in', 'principals', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'faith', 'creators', 'had', 'material', 'sustain', 'plot', 'Standard', 'come', '2009', 'DVD', 'decent', 'commentary', 'track', 'Fletcher', 'Chiarelli', 'sadly', 'not', 'actors', 'seven', 'minutes', 'outtakes', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'little', 'interest', 'alternate', 'ending', 'really', 'just', 'locale', 'versus', 'resolution']",N/A

OK?I could have sworn I wrote a review for this film. Guess it was rejected. Here I go again.This is without a doubt one of the funniest films to be produced in decades. Sandra Bullock-bollocks aside, this is a classic-type film and I couldn't get enough of Ryan Reynolds' goofy meteoric rise to romantic lead.Bullock plays a Canadian, bitter, orphaned publishing editor who needs to marry her assistant/secretary or get deported. As she is viewed to be ""Satan's mistress"" on a good day, there is a lot of wheeling/dealing to be done with her assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds in a comic role of a lifetime).Traveling to meet his folks in Sitka, Alaska, the Old Witch discovers that Andrew Paxton's family is the ""Kennedy Family"" of Alaska. Andrew's dad (Craig T. Nelson) is a stubborn, publishing-world-hating dad who wanted Andrew to follow in his footsteps. Andrew's mother (Mary Steenburgen) is loving and accepting.But it is Andrew's ""Gammi""--his Grandmother Annie (Betty White)--who steals the show. She is a strong, 87-year-old eccentric who is 1/8 Russian and 1/8 Kwakiutl, and as another great reviewer said here, she represents Alaska before it was a state. Gammi still honors the spirits in the Native Way, and her plight as an essentially ignored family elder is a vital part of this film.The laughs are non-stop, but I have to wonder why the heck the Paxtons never asked Sandra Bullock about her family, her parents. Guess that would have jinxed the whole thing, eh?This film won tons of nominations and a few awards. Bullock, who of course won the Oscar for best actress, looks strange and Joan Rivers-like, in spite of the fact that she is, what, 43, 44? Not THAT old. And I'm angry that Betty White wasn't awarded for Best Supporting...though I guess grandmothers aren't all that supportive.The strange and wonderful Oscar Nunez (Ramon-the-Versatile) is a treat in this film, having played only super minor characters in the past.

And in many ways that is what this film is about: hard-as-rocks but beautiful editor Margaret (Sandra Bullock) verbally abuses her assistant, wannabe author Andrew (Ryan Reynolds), until her employers discover her visa is expired and she is to be deported to her native Canada. A fast thought drives her to claim that she and Andrew are engaged in a ploy to avoid deportation.  Shocked at first, Andrew decides to make this ultimate blow to his ego work for him and takes Margaret to his home in Sitka, Alaska to meet his family  - mother (Mary Steenburgen), father (Craig T. Nelson) and wildly alive grandmother (Betty White) - where Margaret must play the charade.  Of course in the beauty of Alaska and under the influence of the warmth of a family Margaret never had, the expected  magic happens and ... you know the rest.Sandra Bullock is good and creates a solid character, but it is Ryan Reynolds who proves his chops as one of the best comedic actors on the screen today.

Some films I bought are 2 star ventures, but I liked them anyway.Sandra Bullock plays one of the most uptight characters I've ever seen in a movie.  That she moves naturally in her restrictive wardrobe is impressive, although it seems that she has a bustle, but of course it's only Sandra Bullock in passing.  Well, it's a nice view either way.  Clearly, I like chick flicks, and this is a good chick flick.It's about the NYC book publishing scene, and a determined female editor who gets things done, but who, for some reason, can't seem to get herself straight with the INS (she's Canadian).  So, like a lot of immigrants these days, she faces deportation, until she decides her rather overly cooperative executive secretary will marry her.  And he goes along with it, until a visit to the INS office ends up with them taking a trip to Sitka, Alaska, for his grandmother's 90th birthday.  Among the glaciers, the spark of romance is lit.If I had a problem with this film, it was with the class angle.  She thinks he's poor, and then she finds he's not, and suddenly, he's not so bad.  It's not the movie's fault, it's our ever more stratified society, but I found that aspect rather unappealing.  Otherwise, as light and fluffy entertainment, this film delivers quite nicely.

""The Proposal"" was directed by Anne Fletcher who also directed ""27 Dresses"", a rom-com with cute possibilities but little substance. This movie starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds was an improvement. Sandra Bullock plays Margaret Tate, a hard-nosed book editor Canadian about to be deported who demands her assistant, Andrew Paxton played by Reynolds to marry her. To prove their relationship, they have to go on a weekend with the Paxton family in Alaska where it gets a little silly.Sandra Bullock always plays a sweetheart and has a Lucille Ball-like clumsiness in her comic arsenal. I fully believed her emotional journey in this movie, but the tough part would have to be believing her being the big bad heartless boss. She was forthright and stern, but she was not exactly Meryl Streep from The Devil Wears Prada and I think that's where she needed to go to really complete that change well.Ryan Reynolds is usually an actor I detest because 90% of his movies, he plays someone who's a big jerk. He's great at smart ass line delivery but I could never feel for him in those because it just wasn't genuine enough. This movie was a BIG change and he came off as a sweetheart. He had the balls to stand up to his dad about not joining the family business and pursuing his dreams as a writer and editor. This was an older, more mature Ryan Reynolds and I hope this turn in his career keeps up because if it does, I'll be happy to watch many more films from him in the future.Betty White was hilarious as Grandma Annie. A scene between her and Sandra Bullock doing some sort of tribal dance in the woods was very strange and occasionally awkward but I had to let it go and laugh since Bullock was singing about ""sweat drip down my balls, all you *itches crawl!"" and freak-dancing. Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen were very good ensemble members playing Andrew Paxton's parents.My favorite off the wall cameo was from Oscar Nunez from The Office. He apparently works every job in this small town - store clerk, minister, exotic dancer. His accent was killing me since he has none in The Office and dancing around with very little clothes.....I just about died laughing because it's such a change from his straight-laced gay accountant character on TV.So was the writing brilliant? Heck no. The ending of course shouldn't make any sense by any stretch of the imagination in real life. Basically you had a premise, a hook, to bring the audience in and then you have to make it play out somehow. There are lots of funny scenes linked together with a fluffy ending and it's a no-work light movie that will amuse you and relax you at the end of the day. For that, it serves its purpose well. It should not be winning any awards, but hopefully it helps the careers of the lead actors.",4,The Proposal Movie Review,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,2902,"['nice', 'piece', 'rom-com', 'fluff', 'end', 'hard', 'day', 'As', 'long', 'try', 'not', 'read', 'too', 'much', 'Proposal', 'was', 'directed', 'Anne', 'Fletcher', 'who', 'also', 'directed', '27', 'Dresses', 'rom-com', 'cute', 'possibilities', 'little', 'substance', 'movie', 'starring', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'improvement', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Margaret', 'Tate', 'hard-nosed', 'book', 'editor', 'Canadian', 'be', 'deported', 'who', 'assistant', 'Andrew', 'Paxton', 'played', 'Reynolds', 'marry', 'prove', 'relationship', 'have', 'go', 'weekend', 'Paxton', 'family', 'Alaska', 'where', 'little', 'silly.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'always', 'sweetheart', 'Lucille', 'Ball-like', 'clumsiness', 'comic', 'arsenal', 'fully', 'believed', 'emotional', 'journey', 'movie', 'tough', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'believing', 'being', 'big', 'bad', 'heartless', 'boss', 'was', 'forthright', 'stern', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'think', 'where', 'needed', 'go', 'really', 'complete', 'change', 'well.Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'usually', 'actor', 'detest', '90', '%', 'movies', 'someone', 'who', 'big', 'jerk', 'great', 'smart', 'ass', 'line', 'delivery', 'could', 'never', 'feel', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'genuine', 'enough', 'movie', 'was', 'BIG', 'change', 'came', 'off', 'sweetheart', 'had', 'balls', 'stand', 'up', 'dad', 'not', 'joining', 'family', 'business', 'pursuing', 'dreams', 'writer', 'editor', 'was', 'older', 'more', 'mature', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'hope', 'turn', 'career', 'up', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'watch', 'many', 'more', 'films', 'future.Betty', 'White', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Grandma', 'Annie', 'scene', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'doing', 'sort', 'tribal', 'dance', 'woods', 'was', 'very', 'strange', 'occasionally', 'awkward', 'had', 'let', 'go', 'laugh', 'Bullock', 'was', 'singing', 'sweat', 'drip', 'balls', '*itches', 'crawl', 'freak-dancing', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'ensemble', 'members', 'playing', 'Andrew', 'Paxton', 'parents.My', 'favorite', 'wall', 'cameo', 'was', 'Oscar', 'Nunez', 'Office', 'apparently', 'job', 'small', 'town', 'store', 'clerk', 'minister', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'accent', 'was', 'killing', 'none', 'Office', 'dancing', 'around', 'very', 'little', 'clothes', '..I', 'just', 'died', 'laughing', 'such', 'change', 'straight-laced', 'gay', 'accountant', 'character', 'TV.So', 'was', 'writing', 'brilliant', 'Heck', 'ending', 'course', 'should', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'real', 'life', 'Basically', 'had', 'premise', 'hook', 'bring', 'audience', 'then', 'have', 'make', 'play', 'out', 'somehow', 'are', 'lots', 'funny', 'scenes', 'linked', 'together', 'fluffy', 'ending', 'no-work', 'light', 'movie', 'will', 'amuse', 'relax', 'end', 'day', 'purpose', 'well', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'winning', 'awards', 'hopefully', 'careers', 'lead', 'actors']",N/A
1273832,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002K0WBXW,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","When not handling his business in superhero cinema, Ryan Reynolds tends to roam into the comedy genre. THE PROPOSAL is his latest romantic comedy and this time he plays opposite Sandra Bullock, an actress I used to follow onscreen, but not lately. Sandra Bullock made an impression on me withSpeed (Widescreen Edition)andWhile You Were Sleeping, and even withDemolition Man, but all those flicks are more than a few years ago and, somewhere along the way, I just stopped watching her. Here, she goes against type but manages to bring back all the elements which had originally made her so endearing.It's about tyrannical, much-loathed book editor Margaret Tate suddenly learning that she's on the verge of being deported back to Canada. Grasping at straws, she bullies her long-suffering assistant Andrew Paxton into pretending that they're engaged, their upcoming ""nuptials"" the key to her remaining in New York. It's not too long before things get crazy out of hand, and Margaret finds herself flying out to Sitka, Alaska on a weekend trip with Andrew to celebrate his grandma's birthday. So cue the usual romantic stuff, with a very suspicious immigration officer closely keeping tabs on the pretend relationship.Thing is, there's nothing new in this one. THE PROPOSAL is actually a by-the-numbers picture with a contrived premise, and so, as it often turns out, whether the film sinks or swims hinges on the compatibility and appeal of the two leads. I have friends who don't dig Reynolds, and nowadays I rarely get swayed by Bullock's charms. But I happen to think that these two actors, in this movie, click together. The mutual dislike of their characters is palpable and very enjoyable, and, honestly, there's nothing quite so exquisite as when two people who really don't like each other end up crashing into each other while both are bare-nekkid. Returning to the down side, predictable sub-plots wing its way towards you and, by gum, there's even that most cliched of cliches: a frantic, last-minute dash to the airport. I was amused, but not too startled at the revelations regarding Margaret. We all suspected, going in, that she just had to have a softer side. And to check off on the ""endearing character quirk"" angle, Margaret happens to harbor a hidden fondness for rap music - and specifically for Lil Jon and Rob Bass & DJ E-Z Rock. That's sweet.By now, Ryan Reynolds has this kind of role down pat. The bemused look, the pinched expression, the deadpan delivery, he's a natural at all that stuff. Several of his insults directed at Bullock are very funny. His character also has a side story centering on his bitter estrangement from his father. Mostly, though, Reynolds serves as the framing device with which to show off Sandra Bullock's pretty good performance. I've never seen Bullock in a mean dragon lady part (it's like seeing Norman Rockwell beat up a child), but I must say she's surprisingly effective and convincing and callous as heck. It's almost a shame that this particular genre demands that she eventually demonstrate a warmer, more vulnerable side to her.

I really liked this movie, it's a romantic comedy with quite a sophisticated plot line.  Ryan Reynolds is very convincing as the scion of small town rich folks, who leaves to make his own way in the world.  He returns with Sandra Bullock, his domineering boss, and they announce their engagement.  Its an arrangement, necessary to avoid Bullock being deported, and you know its going to fall apart.  Along the way however Ryan's relationship with his father, with his home-town sweetheart are illustrated, but the easy pitfalls are avoided.  By the end of the film Sandra Bullock's character rediscovers her humanity, the family are reunited with a new respect for each other , and Ryan can return to New York to find out he actually loves Bullock.  I liked the fact that the story line can support the `full-on' New York working life, and not pay undue homage to tradition and down home values.  I thought the supporting cast were good, apart from the grandmother - the lady from Golden Girls - who I thought was given rubbishy dialogue, and idiotic scenes (especially the earth-mother dance in the woods)I thought Sandra Bullock was unconvincing as the uber-boss, and some of the office scenes were silly, but overall she and Reynolds were convincing. There were moments of great comedy and tenderness during the movie.  As an adult I thought it was very entertaining.But..... In Ireland, however it carries a PG-12 certificate, so my twelve and fourteen year old daughters asked me to bring them to the movie; otherwise I probably wouldn't have gone.  I was very uncomfortable with the scenes where Bullock is brought to a male strip club on the hen party, which I found crude and unnecessary. I was also uncomfortable with Ryan's family's acceptance of the engaged couple sleeping together - the mother and grandmother say something like ` we're not so nave as to think that a young couple ..... "".  In fact, their arrangement  being what it is, the couple don't sleep together.  While the first could have been cut from the movie, the second issue is such a part of the plot that it couldn't.  My objection then is to the certificate.  I'm not sure what age limit I would put on it, I think fifteen would be the lower limit I would choose.  I suppose the film could have triggered a discussion with my daughters about our family values etc, but I was looking for entertainment from the movie, rather than a moral challenge.",3,"Really Liked the movie, but is it suitable for 13 year olds?",1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,2485,"['have', 'three', 'daughters', '9-14', 'may', 'be', 'prude', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sophisticated', 'plot', 'line', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'very', 'convincing', 'scion', 'small', 'town', 'rich', 'folks', 'who', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'world', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'domineering', 'boss', 'announce', 'engagement', 'arrangement', 'necessary', 'avoid', 'Bullock', 'being', 'deported', 'know', 'going', 'fall', 'apart', 'way', 'however', 'Ryan', 'relationship', 'father', 'home-town', 'sweetheart', 'are', 'illustrated', 'easy', 'pitfalls', 'are', 'avoided', 'end', 'film', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'character', 'humanity', 'family', 'are', 'reunited', 'new', 'respect', 'other', 'Ryan', 'can', 'return', 'New', 'York', 'find', 'out', 'actually', 'Bullock', 'liked', 'fact', 'story', 'line', 'can', 'support', 'full-on', 'New', 'York', 'working', 'life', 'not', 'pay', 'undue', 'homage', 'tradition', 'down', 'home', 'values', 'thought', 'supporting', 'cast', 'were', 'good', 'apart', 'grandmother', 'lady', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'given', 'rubbishy', 'dialogue', 'idiotic', 'scenes', 'especially', 'earth-mother', 'dance', 'woods', 'thought', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'was', 'unconvincing', 'uber-boss', 'office', 'scenes', 'were', 'silly', 'overall', 'Reynolds', 'were', 'convincing', 'were', 'moments', 'great', 'comedy', 'tenderness', 'movie', 'adult', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining.But', '..', 'Ireland', 'however', 'PG-12', 'certificate', 'twelve', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'daughters', 'asked', 'bring', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'gone', 'was', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', 'where', 'Bullock', 'brought', 'male', 'strip', 'club', 'hen', 'party', 'found', 'crude', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'also', 'uncomfortable', 'Ryan', 'family', 'acceptance', 'engaged', 'couple', 'sleeping', 'together', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'say', 'something', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'nave', 'think', 'young', 'couple', 'fact', 'arrangement', 'being', 'what', 'couple', 'do', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'together', 'first', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'movie', 'second', 'issue', 'such', 'part', 'plot', 'could', ""n't"", 'My', 'objection', 'then', 'certificate', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'age', 'limit', 'would', 'put', 'think', 'fifteen', 'would', 'be', 'lower', 'limit', 'would', 'choose', 'suppose', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'triggered', 'discussion', 'daughters', 'family', 'values', 'etc', 'was', 'looking', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'rather', 'moral', 'challenge']",N/A

But this movie was totally a recycled storyline from about 3 movies, 2 of which Sandra Bullock starred in.Margaret (Bullock) is an uptight, high powered, book excecutive who terrorizes her co-workers and subordinates.  Andrew (Reynolds) is the long suffering Assistant that has tolerated her manic ways for three years in hopes of a promotion.  She is a Canadian on an expired Visa and will be deported.  HEY, LETS MARRY MY ASSISTANT and stay in the country.  Andrew agrees on the condition that he gets the promotion he has been working for so hard.  All agreed they head to Alaska to visit his family and try to trick the I.N.S.After 3 days they connect, she is moved by his family, especially since she has none.  They continue on with the wedding where certain events transpire that SURPRISE proves Margaret loves Andrew.I wanted to love this film.  I wanted to see Sandra Bullock at her comedic best, again.  But I was left with the impression of seeing this movie before, except in the form of Green Card, Two Weeks Notice, and While You Were Sleeping (one of my all time favorite movies!!!!).Green Card (self explanatory), Two Weeks Notice (Margaret is the same uptight character that is obsessed with work) and While You Were Sleeping (Margaret is Lucy, an orphan that convinces a family she is the fiance of an injured son she helped rescue. She is moved by a family she wishes she had)l.There are funny parts, Betty White is great.  But Reynolds (cutie) and Bullock don't seem to have long enough scenes to really progress their relationship.  Right when their banter is getting good and the timing is gelling, it ends.I wish they could get Bullock some good material, because she is a talented comedic actress and I have missed her in good films.  But this was just not a good pairing.Two Weeks Notice is a good film and Bullock and Hugh Grant have good chemistry.  While You Were Sleeping is hilarious and has a great cast along with a great script.  Reynolds is funny, but the chemistry between these two is just not there.  The end credits prove this since they are shown solo and it is genuinely funny and they shine, but together its a no go.Too bad, since the talent was there.

1273850,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B002K0WBXW,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[2, 2]","Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is a book publisher, and the scourge of all those who work under her. When she finds out that she's up for deportation back to Canada, though, because her visa has run out, she cons her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds), into marrying her so she can stay in the country. As the INS starts looking into their case Margaret must go to Alaska with Andrew to meet his family and to learn more about each other to pass the examination.Sandra Bullock is America's sweetheart. There is doubtful a person in this country who doesn't like her, and 2009 showed that more than ever as she broke her personal box office twice in the same year after 22 years in the game. She also accomplished that by not playing by anyone's rules but her own. While most people are searching for project after project to keep their name out there, but Bullock hasn't appeared onscreen since 2007's Premonition. So after 2 years out of the spotlight how does her return film fare?Very well, actually. Don't get me wrong, this romantic comedy doesn't add anything new to the cannon of romantic comedies, and that was probably intentional. While we all might want a movie that's going to stimulate us in a new way, we can't always expect that. This movie does a great job at making it enjoyable enough to keep your mind off that fact that it's not really feeding you anything new. The actors are effortlessly likable, and have great chemistry together. Had the movie had made any other casting choices this movie would have gone down as just another romcom.It's interesting to me that Bullock chose this role to be her return film. Typically she chooses characters that are immensely likable, but even in this role you still like her even if she is a total ego maniacal control freak. Ryan Reynolds is also a lot of fun to watch, and he's no different here. The real star of this movie though is Betty White as Andrew's grandmother who's turning 90 over the weekend they come to visit. Of course, I don't think anyone doubted the power of Betty White to steal every scene she's in.I highly recommend this movie, sure it's somewhat clich&eacute;, but it's a lot of fun. It's definitely a good movie to just shut off your brain and just enjoy even if you don't typically like romantic comedies.4/5",4,The Proposal,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,2302,"['Margaret', 'Tate', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'book', 'publisher', 'scourge', 'who', 'work', 'When', 'out', 'up', 'deportation', 'back', 'Canada', 'though', 'visa', 'run', 'out', 'assistant', 'Andrew', 'Paxton', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'marrying', 'can', 'stay', 'country', 'INS', 'looking', 'case', 'Margaret', 'must', 'go', 'Alaska', 'Andrew', 'meet', 'family', 'learn', 'more', 'other', 'pass', 'examination.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'America', 'sweetheart', 'doubtful', 'person', 'country', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', '2009', 'showed', 'more', 'ever', 'broke', 'personal', 'box', 'office', 'twice', 'same', 'year', '22', 'years', 'game', 'also', 'accomplished', 'not', 'playing', 'anyone', 'rules', 'own', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'searching', 'project', 'project', 'keep', 'name', 'there', 'Bullock', ""n't"", 'appeared', 'onscreen', '2007', 'Premonition', 'So', '2', 'years', 'spotlight', 'how', 'return', 'film', 'fare', 'Very', 'well', 'actually', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'new', 'cannon', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'was', 'probably', 'intentional', 'might', 'want', 'movie', 'going', 'stimulate', 'new', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'expect', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'keep', 'mind', 'fact', 'not', 'really', 'feeding', 'anything', 'new', 'actors', 'are', 'effortlessly', 'likable', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Had', 'movie', 'had', 'made', 'other', 'casting', 'choices', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'down', 'as', 'just', 'romcom.It', 'interesting', 'Bullock', 'chose', 'role', 'be', 'return', 'film', 'Typically', 'characters', 'are', 'immensely', 'likable', 'even', 'role', 'still', 'even', 'total', 'ego', 'maniacal', 'control', 'freak', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'different', 'here', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'though', 'Betty', 'White', 'Andrew', 'grandmother', 'who', 'turning', '90', 'weekend', 'come', 'visit', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'doubted', 'power', 'Betty', 'White', 'steal', 'scene', 'in.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'sure', 'somewhat', 'clich', 'eacute', 'lot', 'fun', 'definitely', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'shut', 'off', 'brain', 'just', 'enjoy', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'typically', 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies.4/5']",N/A

Allow me to explain before ripping into me.After considerable kicking and screaming, and putting up a fight similar to a gorilla on PCP being wrestled into a wave pool, the ball-and-chain managed to drag me to the theatre to watch this movie.  I tried to give it a fair chance; I really did.  But then the stupid started.Man (Ryan Reynolds) works for Woman (Sandra Bullock) for three years.  He hates her.  He loathes her.  She's the Devil's bride, and causes fire hydrants to combust when she flaunts her wealth in poor neighborhoods on Christmas.  Everyone at work despises her, calling her a witch behind her back, and warning one another of her presence via instant messenger.  Guy is essentially an indentured servant (think Daniel in Karate Kid but without learning the karate), and has been Girl's doormat the entire time he's been with the company.  But when Woman gets served her deportation notice, she concocts a plan to marry Man, stay in the country, and keep making tons of money while making everyone else miserable.  Together, the two make their way to a remote Alaskan town to meet Man's family, proclaim their ""love,"" validate her visa (giggity), and blah, blah, blah...yadda, yadda, yadda.Only the willfully ignorant don't see the rest of this movie coming a mile away.  And THAT'S the problem.  Had there been one deviation from the norm, one step outside of the box, one remotely original idea, this movie would have had a chance with me.  Instead, it's ridiculously predictable, redicatable.There are only two bright sides to this movie:1) The beautiful Alaskan countryside (i.e. Bearskin Neck in Rockport, MA)2) The insight into illegal immigration, and the lengths to which the problem is exposed in the U.S., are scandalously subtle in this film.  While there are countless people at the bottom of the totem pole of illegal immigration (e.g. those packed 20-deep clown-car-style in late 70s station wagons), the security sieve on our borders will not be secure until those with higher status and business involvement are prosecuted and deported to the fullest extent of the law.This is only for the mush-brained who honestly believe that three years of hatred-filled murderous thoughts are overcome by an awkward weekend and the awesome songIt Takes Twoby Rob Base and DJ Easy Rock (and without the song this movie is probably a 1-star).",2,3 Years > 3 Days,1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,2466,"['Redictable', 'word', 'made', 'up', 'watching', 'combination', 'ridiculous', 'predictable', 'Allow', 'explain', 'ripping', 'me.After', 'considerable', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'putting', 'up', 'fight', 'similar', 'gorilla', 'PCP', 'being', 'wrestled', 'wave', 'pool', 'ball-and-chain', 'managed', 'drag', 'theatre', 'watch', 'movie', 'tried', 'give', 'fair', 'chance', 'really', 'did', 'then', 'stupid', 'started.Man', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Woman', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'three', 'years', 'Devil', 'bride', 'fire', 'hydrants', 'combust', 'when', 'wealth', 'poor', 'neighborhoods', 'Christmas', 'Everyone', 'work', 'calling', 'witch', 'back', 'warning', 'one', 'presence', 'instant', 'messenger', 'Guy', 'essentially', 'indentured', 'servant', 'think', 'Daniel', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'learning', 'karate', 'been', 'Girl', 'doormat', 'entire', 'time', 'been', 'company', 'when', 'Woman', 'served', 'deportation', 'notice', 'plan', 'marry', 'Man', 'stay', 'country', 'keep', 'making', 'tons', 'money', 'making', 'everyone', 'else', 'miserable', 'Together', 'two', 'make', 'way', 'remote', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'meet', 'Man', 'family', 'proclaim', 'love', 'validate', 'visa', 'giggity', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'yadda.Only', 'willfully', 'ignorant', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'rest', 'movie', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'problem', 'Had', 'been', 'one', 'deviation', 'norm', 'one', 'step', 'box', 'one', 'remotely', 'original', 'idea', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'Instead', 'ridiculously', 'predictable', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'bright', 'sides', 'movie:1', 'beautiful', 'Alaskan', 'countryside', 'i.e', 'Bearskin', 'Neck', 'Rockport', 'MA', '2', 'insight', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'lengths', 'problem', 'exposed', 'U.S.', 'are', 'scandalously', 'subtle', 'film', 'are', 'countless', 'people', 'bottom', 'totem', 'pole', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'e.g', 'packed', '20-deep', 'clown-car-style', 'late', '70s', 'station', 'wagons', 'security', 'sieve', 'borders', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'secure', 'higher', 'status', 'business', 'involvement', 'are', 'prosecuted', 'deported', 'fullest', 'extent', 'law.This', 'only', 'mush-brained', 'who', 'honestly', 'believe', 'three', 'years', 'hatred-filled', 'murderous', 'thoughts', 'are', 'overcome', 'awkward', 'weekend', 'awesome', 'songIt', 'Takes', 'Twoby', 'Rob', 'Base', 'DJ', 'Easy', 'Rock', 'song', 'movie', 'probably', '1-star']",N/A

She comes close to playing a dominant boss but not quite the same as some of the critters I worked for from an earlier life.

It is so nice to sit down for a few frames and watch a movie that does not make you think too much or contain too much violence et al.  This is just a friendly movie that most adults could enjoy.One item that stressed my humble mind is attempting to ascertain the difference between Blu-ray (BD) and regular DVD disks.  Some suggest that Blu-ray provides a picture and sound that is 6 times better than regular DVD.  That is an exageration of at least 4 to 5.  Maybe the old eyes and ears cannot tell the difference.  Maybe regular will suffice for home theaters.,4,Charming Little Flick,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,1036,"['Sandra', 'Bullock', 'fairly', 'decent', 'actress', 'well', 'movie', 'close', 'playing', 'dominant', 'boss', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'critters', 'worked', 'earlier', 'life', 'assistant', 'real', 'flunky', 'needed', 'little', 'help', 'commanding', 'role', 'development', 'story', 'was', 'easy', 'smooth', 'not', 'exactly', 'easy', 'predetermine', 'outcome', 'scenery', 'just', 'plain', 'fantastic', 'would', 'love', 'live', 'community', 'such', 'one', 'so', 'nice', 'sit', 'down', 'few', 'frames', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'make', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'contain', 'too', 'much', 'violence', 'et', 'al', 'just', 'friendly', 'movie', 'most', 'adults', 'could', 'enjoy.One', 'item', 'stressed', 'humble', 'mind', 'attempting', 'ascertain', 'difference', 'Blu-ray', 'BD', 'regular', 'DVD', 'disks', 'suggest', 'Blu-ray', 'picture', 'sound', '6', 'times', 'better', 'regular', 'DVD', 'exageration', 'least', '4', '5', 'Maybe', 'old', 'eyes', 'ears', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'difference', 'Maybe', 'regular', 'will', 'suffice', 'home', 'theaters']",N/A

These kinds of romantic-comedies must be judged differently than the average film. These films are not made to be appreciated, they're made to be enjoyed...Some are too familiar or poorly written to be enjoyed, but what makes The Proposal a winner is the better-than-average writing and the actor's playing the leads.Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton, the assistant to a stern book-editor named Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock). Margaret is a Canadian and is suddenly faced with deportation; rather than lose her job, Margaret claims to be engaged to Andrew. With a nosy immigration officer breathing down their necks (what they're doing constitutes fraud), Margaret accompanies Andrew to Alaska for the weekend to meet his family.A cute romantic-comedy setup, although we all know where it's going, but you get Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen as Andrew's parents and the wonderful Betty White as his grandmother.Discussing the plot or any filmmaking aesthetics such as cinematography is futile, but one thing worth discussing is the performances specifically by the two leads. Reynolds and Bullock play off each other so well; you can just about pinpoint the reason for the film's success. Their sarcastic bickering is not particularly profound, but they have great comedic timing with each other and amusing chemistry as well. Another surprise is that Reynolds is finally starting to hit his stride as an actor, leaving behind the hyper Van Wilder persona that has plagued his previous film roles. Bullock does pull off the stern attitude of her character, but she doesn't have the menacing, realistic quality that Meryl Streep pulled off in The Devil Wears Prada.The Proposal is a charming, albeit predictable romp that makes for a great date move or just a way to pass the time. The Proposal could have been a terrific romantic-comedy, as it proves by it's first act but once it starts to go the way of the unwritten romantic-comedy handbook it becomes just another amusing way to pass the time. Worth checking out though.GRADE: B-",4,"Better-Than-Average Romantic-Comedy, With Great Chemistry Between the Two Leads",1256860800,"10 30, 2009",2009,2170,"['Proposal', 'typical', 'high-grossing', 'romantic-comedy', 'inevitable', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'interesting', 'set-up', 'kinds', 'romantic-comedies', 'must', 'be', 'judged', 'differently', 'average', 'film', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'made', 'be', 'appreciated', ""'re"", 'made', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'too', 'familiar', 'poorly', 'written', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'Proposal', 'winner', 'better-than-average', 'writing', 'actor', 'playing', 'leads.Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Andrew', 'Paxton', 'assistant', 'stern', 'book-editor', 'named', 'Margaret', 'Tate', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Margaret', 'Canadian', 'suddenly', 'faced', 'deportation', 'rather', 'lose', 'job', 'Margaret', 'be', 'engaged', 'Andrew', 'nosy', 'immigration', 'officer', 'breathing', 'down', 'necks', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'constitutes', 'fraud', 'Margaret', 'Andrew', 'Alaska', 'weekend', 'meet', 'family.A', 'cute', 'romantic-comedy', 'setup', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'get', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Andrew', 'parents', 'wonderful', 'Betty', 'White', 'grandmother.Discussing', 'plot', 'filmmaking', 'aesthetics', 'such', 'cinematography', 'futile', 'one', 'thing', 'worth', 'discussing', 'performances', 'specifically', 'two', 'leads', 'Reynolds', 'Bullock', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'just', 'about', 'pinpoint', 'reason', 'film', 'success', 'sarcastic', 'bickering', 'not', 'particularly', 'profound', 'have', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'other', 'amusing', 'chemistry', 'as', 'well', 'surprise', 'Reynolds', 'finally', 'starting', 'hit', 'stride', 'actor', 'leaving', 'hyper', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'persona', 'plagued', 'previous', 'film', 'roles', 'Bullock', 'pull', 'off', 'stern', 'attitude', 'character', ""n't"", 'have', 'menacing', 'realistic', 'quality', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'pulled', 'off', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada.The', 'Proposal', 'charming', 'predictable', 'romp', 'great', 'date', 'move', 'just', 'way', 'pass', 'time', 'Proposal', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'terrific', 'romantic-comedy', 'first', 'act', 'go', 'way', 'unwritten', 'romantic-comedy', 'handbook', 'just', 'amusing', 'way', 'pass', 'time', 'checking', 'out', 'though.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

Miss Tate is Editor-in-Chief of Ruick and Hunt Publishing, a New York book publisher.  Maggie is so loved by those who work for her that as she arrives, they are all emailing each other announcing ""It's here!""  ""The witch is on her broom"" is the intraoffice email signal that means Maggie is on the move through the office.  Maggie is a Canadian citizen, working for a U.S. firm, awaiting her U.S. visa.As Maggie enters her office, she finds Andrew standing at attention, holding her Starbuck's Venti something-or-other flavor. Very quickly into the movie, Maggie is summoned to her boss' office and advised that her visa was denied and she is about to be deported.  She had left the U.S. while the visa was being applied for and had violated the rules, so the application was denied.  Well, now that's a fine kettle of fish!  She cannot reapply for a year and cannot work for a U.S. company while she is deported.  Out of desperation, she announces that her and Andrew are getting married!Maggie tells Andy they will work it out and get a quickie divorce later.  When they head to immigration, the investigating agent explains they must return the following week and be prepared to answer questions about each other and had better know the answer!  Andy is a little scared but he wants to keep his job and hopes to become an editor, so...Off they go to meet his family for the weekend, in Sitka, Alaska!  It turns out the family has some money and a gorgeous home.  Maggie arrives like a princess without her kingdom, stumbling around and walking over stones in heels and climbing dock ladders in a full-skirted dress.  We get to see a few nice pictures of Alaska, too.Andy's family includes Betty White as his adoring and lively Grandom, Mary Steenburgen as his loving Mom, and the guy who played ""The Coach"" as the father he doesn't get along with so well.  Dad wanted Andy to take over the family business, but Andy went off to NYC.  Andy is an only child.The whole family looks at Maggie as ""not for Andy"" and his ""engagement"" is a huge surprise to all, but Mom and Grandmom welcome Maggie to the family.

Even after the first five minutes of the film were soundless due to technical issues in my theater, I have to say it's one of the best films romantic comedies I've seen in quite some time.Ryan Reynolds doesn't need words to act, his eyes and facial expressions make his thoughts loud and clear. Are there more expressive eyes in Hollywood? And sarcasm, oh, there is plenty of sarcasm from both main characters. Nobody does psycho/prickly/vulnerable like Sandra Bullock. Anyone who loved While You Were Sleeping and Two Weeks Notice is going to find similar flavors of fun and fire in The Proposal.The story is quirky and odd enough that I smirked through much of the plot as it unfolded. You can't have romantic comedy without some predictability, but it was a joy to watch. Oscar Nunez (The Office) played multiple scenes and one left me laughing until I squirmed. If you can't stomach the thought of Oscar dancing in a Speedo, you might want to wait for the DVD version so you can skip it. A semi-nude scene with Bullock and Reynolds, along with the Speedo dance make it iffy for kids, as does a smattering of off-color comments and a bit of language. The semi-nude scene runs in the previews I've seen, but there are a few prolonged moments with Bullock covering up but showing lots of skin and a side view of a collision that make it longer in the movie. Betty White looks great and plays a grandma with a special connection to Mother Earth. The scenery is breathtaking.Overall, though not perfect, this is a movie worth the few hours and the full-price movie ticket investment.

Her original wedding dress she has kept nicely pressed, in a style that recalls the suffragette age, with a soupcon of Isadora Duncan-inspired flowing robes to give it some classical spice.  For the wealthy Paxton family, Grandma Annie (nicely played by Betty White) is an authentic throwback not only to the days of the pioneers, but to an older people as well--the Indians.  In private she still performs the dances of the First Nations, calling on the spirit of the forests, the totem animals, and the surrounding oceans, to help her dance the way of the female shaman.Her family life is grim, so she keeps holding on to the dreams and memories, as do many elders in our society.  Her son (or son in law?  We couldn't decide) Joe Paxton, is a bitter tycoon for whom all the money in the world can't heal the thwarted desires in his heart.  His wife, Mary Steenburgen, feels weird when a woman pretty much her own age comes to her mansion and tells her she's engaged to Mary's son, a young stripling who has left the tribe and moved to New York, city of the big steeples.  Grandma Annie goes to the woods and makes tribal noises, having adapted the place to a stage set on which to perform her own performativity as a native woman.  Is she trying to make reparations, in her own quiet way, to the original Native settlers of the Sitka area?  We don't know.  The movie wastes a lot of time on its subplot, which involves the ponytailed city woman (Sandra Bullock) deciding that Alaska life isn't too bad in a hundred story mansion on the top of the hill with every retail outlet in the town bearing your name.Grandma Annie takes matters into her own hands at the dramatic conclusion, but my wife and I both felt disappointed that her struggles were trivialized, and that she was in the movie to make Sandra Bullock look like a younger actress than she is.It could have been a trailblazing cinematic document, and the best parts of it are!",3,Make way for tomorrow,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,2566,"['Others', 'may', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'four', 'had', 'not', 'just', 'seen', 'new', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'release', 'Make', 'Way', 'Tomorrow', 'Victor', 'Moore', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'classic', '1930s', 'hints', 'kind', 'movie', 'Proposal', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'honestly', 'plight', 'aged', 'society.Grandma', 'Annie', 'woman', 'hard', 'country', 'Alaska', 'was', 'state', 'near', 'death', 'today', 'prosperous', 'tamed', 'Sitka', 'memories', 'range', 'widely', 'back', 'earliest', 'days', 'white', 'civilization', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'bear', 'man', 'married', 'long', 'ago', 'original', 'wedding', 'dress', 'kept', 'nicely', 'pressed', 'style', 'suffragette', 'age', 'soupcon', 'Isadora', 'Duncan-inspired', 'flowing', 'robes', 'give', 'classical', 'spice', 'wealthy', 'Paxton', 'family', 'Grandma', 'Annie', 'nicely', 'played', 'Betty', 'White', 'authentic', 'throwback', 'not', 'only', 'days', 'pioneers', 'older', 'people', 'well', 'Indians', 'private', 'still', 'dances', 'First', 'Nations', 'calling', 'spirit', 'forests', 'totem', 'animals', 'surrounding', 'oceans', 'help', 'dance', 'way', 'female', 'shaman.Her', 'family', 'life', 'grim', 'holding', 'dreams', 'memories', 'do', 'many', 'elders', 'society', 'son', 'son', 'law', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'Joe', 'Paxton', 'bitter', 'tycoon', 'whom', 'money', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'heal', 'thwarted', 'desires', 'heart', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'feels', 'weird', 'when', 'woman', 'pretty', 'much', 'own', 'age', 'mansion', 'engaged', 'Mary', 'son', 'young', 'stripling', 'who', 'left', 'tribe', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'big', 'steeples', 'Grandma', 'Annie', 'woods', 'tribal', 'noises', 'having', 'adapted', 'place', 'stage', 'set', 'perform', 'own', 'performativity', 'native', 'woman', 'trying', 'make', 'reparations', 'own', 'quiet', 'way', 'original', 'Native', 'settlers', 'Sitka', 'area', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'lot', 'time', 'subplot', 'ponytailed', 'city', 'woman', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'deciding', 'Alaska', 'life', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'hundred', 'story', 'mansion', 'top', 'hill', 'retail', 'outlet', 'town', 'bearing', 'name.Grandma', 'Annie', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'wife', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'struggles', 'were', 'trivialized', 'was', 'movie', 'make', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'look', 'younger', 'actress', 'is.It', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trailblazing', 'cinematic', 'document', 'best', 'parts', 'are']",N/A

Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have a slight implausibility issue as a couple but they make the most of the clever script and as you knew it would, it all turns out happy in the end.Bullock plays Margaret Tate, a harpy of a boss in a New York publishing firm. Reynolds is Andrew Paxton, her baby-boy secretary, a young man with brains and aspirations who puts up with her controlling ways for the sake of his career and his writing prospects. Margaret is Canadian and has been ignoring routine Immigration Service requirements; suddenly she is about to be deported and she announces in front of a stunned Andrew that they are going to be married. Andrew finds his backbone and sets conditions--the first being a trip to his home in Alaska for his grannie's 90th birthday party.Mary Steenburgen and Craig T Nelson play Andrew's parents. Along with the irrepressible Betty White (playing ""Gammie""), they decide that a wedding the very next day would be just the thing. And perhaps it would be, but for the Elliott Ness-style immigration agent turning up at the family compound. And of course all the family love makes hard-bitten Margaret re-think the deal.Oh, you can guess how the gags go, but that doesn't make it any less fun. Margaret is lost without phone and computer. There are boats and scenery, and the Alaskan midnight sun, and the family popping in and out of the bedroom while Andrew is trying to sleep on the floor. Betty White puts on a cape to dance and chant in front of a fire, luring Margaret to join her for a spontaneous sexy rap. In a killingly funny scene, ""the girls"" take Margaret out to see a local stripper named Ramone (Oscar Nunez) who later turns out to be a shop owner and marriage celebrant. Altogether a funny, heartwarming romp.Bullock and Ryan have great timing and delivery; the supporting cast is stellar; and the scenery pleases without being obtrusive. As an example of its genre, The Proposal [Theatrical Release] convinced me that it deserves five stars. Go on, you'll come out of the theater smiling and isn't that worth five stars?PG 13, a little bit of nudity and some language.Linda Bulger, 2009",5,"""Let's do it!""",1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,2297,"['may', 'be', 'nothing', 'new', 'sun', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'genre', 'lots', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'Proposal', '[', 'Theatrical', 'Release', ']', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'have', 'slight', 'implausibility', 'issue', 'couple', 'make', 'most', 'clever', 'script', 'knew', 'would', 'out', 'happy', 'end.Bullock', 'Margaret', 'Tate', 'harpy', 'boss', 'New', 'York', 'publishing', 'firm', 'Reynolds', 'Andrew', 'Paxton', 'baby-boy', 'secretary', 'young', 'man', 'brains', 'aspirations', 'who', 'up', 'controlling', 'ways', 'sake', 'career', 'writing', 'prospects', 'Margaret', 'Canadian', 'been', 'ignoring', 'routine', 'Immigration', 'Service', 'requirements', 'suddenly', 'be', 'deported', 'front', 'stunned', 'Andrew', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'married', 'Andrew', 'backbone', 'sets', 'conditions', 'first', 'being', 'trip', 'home', 'Alaska', 'grannie', '90th', 'birthday', 'party.Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Craig', 'T', 'Nelson', 'play', 'Andrew', 'parents', 'irrepressible', 'Betty', 'White', 'playing', 'Gammie', 'decide', 'wedding', 'very', 'next', 'day', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'thing', 'perhaps', 'would', 'be', 'Elliott', 'Ness-style', 'immigration', 'agent', 'turning', 'up', 'family', 'compound', 'course', 'family', 'love', 'hard-bitten', 'Margaret', 're-think', 'deal.Oh', 'can', 'guess', 'how', 'gags', 'go', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'fun', 'Margaret', 'lost', 'phone', 'computer', 'are', 'boats', 'scenery', 'Alaskan', 'midnight', 'sun', 'family', 'popping', 'bedroom', 'Andrew', 'trying', 'sleep', 'floor', 'Betty', 'White', 'cape', 'dance', 'chant', 'front', 'fire', 'luring', 'Margaret', 'join', 'spontaneous', 'sexy', 'rap', 'killingly', 'funny', 'scene', 'girls', 'take', 'Margaret', 'see', 'local', 'stripper', 'named', 'Ramone', 'Oscar', 'Nunez', 'who', 'later', 'out', 'be', 'shop', 'owner', 'marriage', 'celebrant', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'romp.Bullock', 'Ryan', 'have', 'great', 'timing', 'delivery', 'supporting', 'cast', 'stellar', 'scenery', 'being', 'obtrusive', 'example', 'genre', 'Proposal', '[', 'Theatrical', 'Release', ']', 'convinced', 'five', 'stars', 'Go', ""'ll"", 'come', 'theater', 'smiling', ""n't"", 'worth', 'five', 'stars', 'PG', '13', 'little', 'bit', 'nudity', 'language.Linda', 'Bulger', '2009']",N/A

She tells her astonished boss and a very skeptical INS agent that she is going to marry her assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds, a very engaging actor), a dogsbody whom she bullies and overworks.  He thinks fast on his feet and extracts the promise of promotion to editor as a condition.  Then he takes her home to meet the family.  In Sitka, Alaska.Up till then it was passable, although where have we heard this premise before?  But then it gets so formulaic and silly, it was barely watchable in spots.  The scene where the two actors accidentally get tangled up together stark naked was stupid and cheap.  Betty White is always a joy, and I'm glad she's getting work; but you could see how they used her in this.  Of course Margaret softens and becomes lovable, and of course Andrew falls in love with her.  Why, is not exactly explained.  Reynolds was 33 when this was made; Bullock was 12 years older and looked it.  It would have been a better movie if the writer had made a point of it, I think. You know, wasted her youth on her career.  Sort of like Bullock's having wasted hers making too many films like this.  Remember the chapel scene in While You Were Sleeping where Lucy (Bullock) stops the ceremony and confesses that she's been deceiving the groom's family?  Yup.  She does it again.  The really irritating thing is that they thought we wouldn't notice, or if we did, it didn't matter.  The expendable, disposable audience. Bullock was a producer of this and frankly I'm turned off by this dame's gimlet eye on profit.There's no accounting for taste, and I know I've loved some films many others hated.  But some of these 5-star posts are just bewildering.  ""The chemistry!  You can just tell these actors like each other so much!"" Well, why shouldn't they like each other?  And even if (for some reason) they loathed each other, do you really think we would know?  It seems to suggest these actors couldn't act if they had to.  A number of posts mention the gorgeous Alaska scenery.  I mean, I've never even been to Alaska and I knew at once that house was not in Alaska.  How easy it is to fool people, after all.  It makes me feel jaded, that's what.I won't rent this film again.  I'll certainly never buy it.

I found the pairing of a younger man with an obviously older woman a delightful twist because the movie showed them both getting past age issues and finding each other's underlying qualities and beautiful hearts.

She then has to make a lot a concessions to him so he will go along with the plan and convince immigration.  What follows is that Margaret has to travel with Andrew to a family birthday party and Andrew is not who she thought he was.It takes a while into the movie for some let up to Margaret's ""Dragon Lady"" personality.

The role features Sandra, as Margaret Tate, a busy ego-tistical book editor, whom is more concerned about her job than having a sense of love and happiness. Yet, she faces the role of being deported back to Canada and losing her job. Where she stumbles on the idea of marrying her assistant, which Ryan Reynolds plays. As a result, the two of them flock down to a small town in Alaska to meet what would be her in-laws played by Mary Steenburgen (Ted Danson's Wife) and Craig T. Nelson from Coach, and her editor's assistants grandmother played by Betty White.Margaret has a bit of trouble trying to adapt to her assistant's family and finds herself in awkward scenario's from trying to rescue a dog from a eagle while being more wsrapped up with her business calls and then losing her cell phone from the eagle's claws, from being uncomfortable with a Native-American traditional dance with Betty White. At the end of it, Margaret decides it would be better to be deported, only to leave her assistant and his family, broken-hearted and thinking it was a mistake. Little did she know as she heads back to New York, to pack up everything, her assistant played by Ryan finds he has real love for his boss and wants to marry her. Yet, only finding themselves go through the legal U.S. immigration process all over again. The film is great, but at times Betty's characters steal the spotlight so well, that there could've been a bit more chemistry you'd want to see with Sandra and Ryan.Nevertheless, I had a absolutely great time laughing out loud at Sandra Bullock and the movie The Proposal. It honestly has been one of the best movies I've seen from the Summer season in awhile. It really is a great date movie, and something you really will have a fun time laughing out loud to. This honestly is Sandra's best date movie since While You Were Sleeping, and if there is a time you want to look for love, head down to the movie theatres and see The Proposal.Price: B+Story: BActing: B+Overall: B+",4,Sandra's Says Yes,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,2793,"['question', 'power', 'good', 'movies', 'hype', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'currently', 'movie', 'are', 'other', 'films', 'can', 'feel', 'can', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'time', 'laughing', 'heart', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'been', 'case', 'many', 'films', 'lately', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'honestly', 'been', 'awhile', 'made', 'spectacular', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'had', 'focused', 'personal', 'life', 'marry', 'mechanic', 'Jesse', 'James', 'settling', 'down', 'back', 'Texas', 'new', 'sense', 'life', 'now', 'back', 'yet', 'again', 'first', 'comedy', 'several', 'years', 'deliver', 'great', 'proposal', 'delightful', 'date', 'night', 'movie.The', 'Proposal', 'new', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'comedy', 'actually', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'surprise', 'gems', 'actually', 'worth', 'enjoying', 'movies', 'role', 'Sandra', 'Margaret', 'Tate', 'busy', 'ego-tistical', 'book', 'editor', 'whom', 'more', 'concerned', 'job', 'having', 'sense', 'love', 'happiness', 'role', 'being', 'deported', 'back', 'Canada', 'losing', 'job', 'Where', 'idea', 'marrying', 'assistant', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'result', 'two', 'flock', 'down', 'small', 'town', 'Alaska', 'meet', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'in-laws', 'played', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Wife', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Coach', 'editor', 'assistants', 'played', 'Betty', 'White.Margaret', 'bit', 'trouble', 'trying', 'adapt', 'assistant', 'family', 'awkward', 'scenario', 'trying', 'rescue', 'dog', 'eagle', 'being', 'more', 'wsrapped', 'up', 'business', 'calls', 'then', 'losing', 'cell', 'phone', 'eagle', 'claws', 'being', 'uncomfortable', 'Native-American', 'traditional', 'dance', 'Betty', 'White', 'end', 'Margaret', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'be', 'deported', 'only', 'leave', 'assistant', 'family', 'broken-hearted', 'thinking', 'was', 'mistake', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'pack', 'up', 'everything', 'assistant', 'played', 'Ryan', 'real', 'love', 'boss', 'marry', 'only', 'finding', 'go', 'legal', 'U.S.', 'immigration', 'process', 'over', 'again', 'film', 'great', 'times', 'Betty', 'characters', 'steal', 'spotlight', 'so', 'well', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'chemistry', ""'d"", 'want', 'see', 'Sandra', 'Ryan.Nevertheless', 'had', 'absolutely', 'great', 'time', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'movie', 'Proposal', 'honestly', 'been', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Summer', 'season', 'awhile', 'really', 'great', 'date', 'movie', 'something', 'really', 'will', 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'honestly', 'Sandra', 'best', 'date', 'movie', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'time', 'want', 'look', 'love', 'head', 'down', 'movie', 'theatres', 'see', 'Proposal.Price', 'B+Story', 'BActing', 'B+Overall', 'B+']",N/A

1273945,A3V5O5G3I1T2NX,B002K0WBXW,Mike,"[2, 3]","Synopsis:  Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is a domineering executive whom no one likes because of her cold and often cruel personality.  Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds)is her entirely-dominated assistant, who has the task of doing whatever she wants when she wants it.  When Margaret is threatened to be deported back to her native Canada due her visa status, she proposes that Andrew that they have a sham-marriage so she can stick around.  Andrew is reluctant at first, but sees what he can get out of the deal from her (namely, getting his work published).  They fly from New York to Andrew's native Alaska to see his grandmother (Betty White) for her 90th birthday and to inform his family about their plans to get married.  Although Andrew's father Joe (Craig T. Nelson) is skeptical, his mother Grace (Mary Steenburgen) is ecstatic and surprises the couple by making their marriage plans for them in Alaska.  Though initially cold to everything going on around her, Margaret begins to see how well she's accepted by Andrew's family and it starts to open the floodgates for her as to why she's so emotionally distant, which allows her to admit to herself that she genuinely loves Andrew.  Will she go on with the marriage, or will the guilt drive her to admit that she's trying to pull of a scam?There were a lot of fun moments in the film and up to the ending I was excited to see what would happen.  But then the ending took a somewhat un-climactic turn into predictability.  I don't want to discuss it because I don't want to give it away, but had the ending been done differently from the wedding scene to the finish, I may have gotten more enjoyment out of it than what I did.  It was like the movie forsake the budding chemistry between the two leads to throw out an ending that would be easier to spell out for the audience.Be that as it may, Bullock and Reynolds were just awesome together, the cinematography itself was great, and the overall comedy was definitely there.  People who would be less-particular than I am about the film's ending probably loved it because aside from that, it was a good time.  I say it's definitely a solid rental and worth purchasing if you really enjoy it.",3,"To Me, The Ending Killed What Would Have Been An Otherwise Great Film",1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,2200,"['Synopsis', 'Margaret', 'Tate', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'domineering', 'executive', 'whom', 'one', 'cold', 'often', 'cruel', 'personality', 'Andrew', 'Paxton', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'entirely-dominated', 'assistant', 'who', 'task', 'doing', 'when', 'When', 'Margaret', 'threatened', 'be', 'deported', 'back', 'native', 'Canada', 'due', 'visa', 'status', 'Andrew', 'have', 'sham-marriage', 'can', 'stick', 'around', 'Andrew', 'reluctant', 'first', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'deal', 'namely', 'getting', 'work', 'published', 'fly', 'New', 'York', 'Andrew', 'native', 'Alaska', 'see', 'grandmother', 'Betty', 'White', '90th', 'birthday', 'inform', 'family', 'plans', 'get', 'married', 'Andrew', 'father', 'Joe', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'skeptical', 'mother', 'Grace', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'ecstatic', 'couple', 'making', 'marriage', 'plans', 'Alaska', 'Though', 'initially', 'cold', 'everything', 'going', 'Margaret', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'accepted', 'Andrew', 'family', 'open', 'floodgates', 'why', 'so', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'admit', 'herself', 'genuinely', 'Andrew', 'Will', 'go', 'marriage', 'will', 'guilt', 'drive', 'admit', 'trying', 'pull', 'scam', 'were', 'lot', 'fun', 'moments', 'film', 'up', 'ending', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'then', 'ending', 'took', 'somewhat', 'un-climactic', 'turn', 'predictability', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'discuss', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'had', 'ending', 'been', 'done', 'differently', 'wedding', 'scene', 'finish', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'movie', 'forsake', 'budding', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'throw', 'out', 'ending', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'spell', 'out', 'audience.Be', 'may', 'Bullock', 'Reynolds', 'were', 'just', 'awesome', 'together', 'cinematography', 'was', 'great', 'overall', 'comedy', 'was', 'definitely', 'there', 'People', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'less-particular', 'am', 'film', 'ending', 'probably', 'loved', 'aside', 'was', 'good', 'time', 'say', 'definitely', 'solid', 'rental', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'really', 'enjoy']",N/A

But it's a bittersweet enjoyment watching her in a half hearted comedy like this, while waiting for the next `interesting' role to come along.Bullock plays the uptight and unpleasant, but high flying editor of a New York based book firm, and Ryan Reynolds her long suffering assistant who actually is a nice guy with his own quietly held ambitions.  Her character is Canadian, and when (in an unlikely twist) Immigration come calling to deport her, on the spur of the moment she enlists her assistant.. to marry her.  However, this then involves a trip to Alaska to convince the Immigration authorities their sudden love is genuine.The Alaskan scenery is gorgeous, and the cast believable - but come across as uninspired by the material.  On the plus side we have his relatives in Alaska, particularly the good value Betty White (Golden Girls) as his grandmother.  Then there's Bullock, who can do these in her sleep.  On the down side, the plot is both predictable and hard to believe (aside from the unlikely Immigration Officer, there's the eagle carrying away the dog, the Mother Earth grandma chants, not to mention the resolution).  It's one of those movies you watch with a faint smile crossing your face now and again, and afterwards you remember it had a few funny moments...  but that's about the extent of the impact it has, mostly because it takes too long to show any likeable side to either of the characters, so that in the end the will-they won't-they aspect hardly matters.  All you're left with then is the humour from the various fish-out-of-water gags as Bullock's high heeled cosmopolitan comes to terms with the wilderness and what it means to have a real family.  If harmless rom-com with no brain engaged, but perhaps some nice scenery is what you're after, then by all means rent.. but this is really quite disposable fluff, devoid of the chemistry or `je ne sais quois' that makes these things truly sparkle.Scrapes a pass mark, but only if you're a Bullock fan, and even then only because the Alaskan scenery was nice.",3,Adequate but underwhelming addition to the rom-com genre,1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,2127,"['know', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'can', 'make', 'even', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'one', 'enjoyable', 'bittersweet', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'half', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'waiting', 'next', 'interesting', 'role', 'come', 'along.Bullock', 'uptight', 'unpleasant', 'high', 'flying', 'editor', 'New', 'York', 'based', 'book', 'firm', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'long', 'suffering', 'assistant', 'who', 'actually', 'nice', 'guy', 'own', 'quietly', 'held', 'ambitions', 'character', 'Canadian', 'when', 'unlikely', 'twist', 'Immigration', 'come', 'calling', 'deport', 'spur', 'moment', 'assistant..', 'marry', 'However', 'then', 'trip', 'Alaska', 'convince', 'Immigration', 'authorities', 'sudden', 'love', 'genuine.The', 'Alaskan', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'cast', 'believable', 'come', 'uninspired', 'material', 'plus', 'side', 'have', 'relatives', 'Alaska', 'particularly', 'good', 'value', 'Betty', 'White', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'grandmother', 'Then', 'Bullock', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'sleep', 'down', 'side', 'plot', 'predictable', 'hard', 'believe', 'aside', 'unlikely', 'Immigration', 'Officer', 'eagle', 'carrying', 'away', 'dog', 'Mother', 'Earth', 'grandma', 'chants', 'not', 'mention', 'resolution', 'one', 'movies', 'watch', 'faint', 'smile', 'crossing', 'face', 'now', 'again', 'afterwards', 'remember', 'had', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'extent', 'impact', 'mostly', 'too', 'long', 'show', 'likeable', 'side', 'characters', 'end', 'will-they', ""won't-they"", 'aspect', 'hardly', 'matters', ""'re"", 'left', 'then', 'humour', 'various', 'fish-out-of-water', 'gags', 'Bullock', 'high', 'heeled', 'cosmopolitan', 'terms', 'wilderness', 'what', 'have', 'real', 'family', 'harmless', 'rom-com', 'brain', 'engaged', 'perhaps', 'nice', 'scenery', 'what', ""'re"", 'then', 'means', 'rent..', 'really', 'quite', 'disposable', 'fluff', 'devoid', 'chemistry', 'je', 'ne', 'sais', 'quois', 'things', 'truly', 'pass', 'mark', 'only', ""'re"", 'Bullock', 'fan', 'even', 'then', 'only', 'Alaskan', 'scenery', 'was', 'nice']",N/A

Leading woman & man Sandra Bullock & Ryan Reynolds deftly elevate this romantic comedy above what could have been standard formula fare. Bullock plays Margaret, a pretty but not-so-likable book editor who's all aggression & job focus; Reynolds plays Andrew, her dependable but secretly miserable secretary who jumps when she snaps her fingers. You practically know these characters' thoughts just by reading their faces: Margaret is brazenly indifferent to Andrew, who pretty much uses him as her doormat; Andrew quietly detests her, thinking she's the Wicked Witch of the West (or in this case, East). But all that changes when she's notified that her green card is invalid & she's going to be deported back to Canada. Suddenly, her entire future is in jeopardy. What to do? Simple---she grabs her secretary & informs her boss that they're engaged! The subtle confusion in Reynolds' eyes as they slowly convey panic is fun to watch. Under the scrutiny of an externally tough but wimpy deportation officer, Margaret is whisked away by her ""fiancee"" (after he blackmails her into a job promotion to secure his participation) to Sitka, Alaska to meet the well-off Paxton family, hoping to successfully break the news, have a ""quickie marriage"", then divorce later & go their separate ways. Naturally, during the course of events with the Paxtons, these two ""working strangers"" finally get to know each other for the first time, and what was all ""pretend"" becomes quite real & genuine.The supporting cast is top notch: Craig T. Nelson & Mary Steenburgen are dependable as always as Andrew's parents; Michael Nouri, offering his cool presence (all too briefly) as Margaret's boss; and then there's the wonderful Betty White, still feisty & a natural scene-stealer well into her 80's. There are some great comic moments in the film---the bird of prey snatching up the family pooch (then Margaret's phone); Margaret's embarrassing ""bachelorette party"" with the girls as she's entertained by ""Chippendales reject"" Ramone; and the humiliating ""running into each other naked"" scene, to name a few.Not an Oscar-winner, by any means.

1273986,A2HRVVDJMY5M4Z,B002K0WBXW,R. Graff,"[4, 6]","I enjoy romantic comedies more than most would admit.  And I heard about this one, and thought the concept sounded interesting (boss and her employee pretending to be married).  Of course we all know what would happen from that point on, but I still thought this could be likable, since it was such a big hit and a lot of people had nice things to say about it.  Unfortunately, I felt like I was let down.I will start by saying that there are quite a few things to like about this movie, which made me debate over giving it 3 or 4 stars.  For one, Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have really good chemistry, and their scenes of bantering and getting each other into uncomfortable situations are some of the best parts of the movie.  Reynold's character is very likable, and almost anybody can understand where he's coming from.  Furthermore, Betty White still shows that she can make the most of an otherwise unimportant role, and is probably one of the best actors in the movie.But with all that being said and done, I have to tell you that the flaws are too glaring to ignore.  The biggest, perhaps, is that Bullock's character, Margaret, is not someone you like at all.  She's the stereotypical boss from Hell, which would be okay if the script showed the other side to her better.  The best we get is when she reveals she cried when someone called her a ""poisonous [b-word]"" by a worker she just fired.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't feel sorry for people who hurt others getting a taste of their own medicine.  Furthermore, the two of them don't really fall in love for any other reason than they feel sorry for each other (Margaret is alone in the world, Reynolds' Alex has a bad relationship with his family), which is not satisfying enough of a reason for me.  And as I said earlier, this film largely rips off the movies Devil Wears Prada (evil boss), Meet the Parents (awkward meeting of future in-laws), and While You Were Sleeping (lonely girl with no family is welcomed into one she deceives).To sum it all up, this is a movie that will entertain you, but it will also frustrate you by the time it's over.

1273991,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002K0WBXW,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","I am not a big Ryan Reynolds fan.  Prior to THE PROPOSAL, I  had never seen anything he'd done before that left any kind of impression on me.  My wife was the same way...""have we seen him in anything before?""  Bland (even wooden), usually in dreadful films like WAITING, or in utterly forgettable roles such as in WOLVERINE.Sandra Bullock is a past-master of the romantic comedy.  She can give ""smart*ss"" and she can do ""sweet"" in the same movie.  She doesn't really create believable people as much as delightful screen personas.  Lately, though, she's clearly been fighting her age...trying to pull off roles that were too ""young"" for her.  I don't know if it's her or her plastic surgery, but she has tended to mostly look vaguely angry...and her makeup is usually VERY harsh these days.So I was primed not to care very much for THE PROPOSAL.  And as a whole, it is a very predictable, by-the-numbers romantic comedy of the ""they hate each other right up until the last second"" ilk.  But there were just a few scenes that popped with excellent timing, set-up and execution that had me laughing hard...so despite my better inclinations, I'm actually giving this movie a fairly solid recommendation.  For what it attempts and accomplishes.If you haven't seen the trailer:  Bullock plays a tough-as-nails book editor who has no life beyond work.  She is feared by everyone in the office, because she is ruthless and apparently very good.  She also bullies her assistant (Reynolds), making him work nights & weekends, and forcing him to run all kinds of errands that are certainly beneath his title.  One day, this Canadian finds that she has been ignoring her immigration attorney for too long, and she is about to be deported.  She will lose her position (for a year) to a man she just fired.  Just as she is absorbing this news, in walks Reynolds.  And Bullock hits upon the brilliant idea to announce to her bosses that she and Reynolds are about to be married, thus securing her place in the US.INS is understandably skeptical, so for reasons that  really don't make a lot of sense, Bullock & Reynolds feel they must immediately fly to Alaska to meet Reynolds' family and old friends.  It's the typical ""fish out of water"" scenario, with Bullock trying to walk in stiletto heels through a tiny Alaskan fishing town.  Or trying to cope with her fear of boats.  Or trying to get along with the family dog when she hates dogs.  NO surprises.  The plot chugs along predictably to an ending that doesn't surprise at all.Yet, as I said, this film has its wonderful comic moments.  In fact, what may be the best scene comes fairly early.  When Bullock announces her intent to marry Reynolds, he has had no time to prepare.  It hits him by surprise.  And his reaction shots are perfect.  He knows that everyone is in on something, and that he must cover as best he can.  Yet he also has a glimmer of the ridiculous notion Bullock has just tossed on him...that they are in love and engaged.  He's mortified, but wants to be professional.  He wants to deny it, but instinct tells him not to thwart his terrifying boss.  I can't adequately describe it...somehow, Reynolds had a moment  heretofore unachieved by him as a performer.  It's enough to make you like his character from that point on.Other moments nearly as good pop up from time to time.  When the two  have an unwanted ""nude collision.""  A silly incident with Bullock, the dog, an eagle and a cell phone!The movie has the required ""serious"" moments too, such as when we discover why Bullock is so uptight and unfriendly.  These scenes only work because the two stars have earned our goodwill in the comedic scenes...otherwise the somber moments would be unbearable.The supporting cast is mostly window-dressing.  Poor Mary Steenburgen, who is a great actress, is relegated yet again to an unfunny role as ""mother.""  Craig T. Nelson looks like a coach  gone to seed, and isn't very happy about it, as ""father.""  Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN) has a thankless role as a former girlfriend.  Oscar Nunez (TV's ""The Office"") shows up in a crazy role (I won't spoil what it is) that gets some laughs, but in tone, belongs to another film. But the remarkable Betty White is there to shake things up as Reynolds' grandmother.  She's playing a character too over-the-top to be convincing...but she does it with such comic verve that you can't help but like her.  She's 87 years old (doesn't look it at all) and has not lost one moment of her comic timing.  Whoever had the idea to cast her should get 25% of the profits of this film! (On the other end of the spectrum is Denis O'Hare, usually a reliable character actor in both dramas and comedies, who shows up as the suspicious INS agent...and brings a tin ear to his dialogue that makes virtually every utterance supremely unfunny.  He's trying to make a part that doesn't actually have any laughs into something it is not.)It was amusing that the movie takes place mostly in Alaska.  It was certainly a beautiful location, but you have to think that the driving decision behind that somehow relates to the attention Sarah Palin brought to the state.  Can't you just see a bunch of ""suits"" patting themselves on the back for their timeliness?In the end, THE PROPOSAL is a predictable romantic comedy.  I enjoyed myself, and I can even envision watching the film again some day on DVD with my daughter and her friends, perhaps.  It doesn't make me put Reynolds on my list of favorites...but he sure scored a lot of points with me.  Bullock gets a reprieve.  Betty White gets an MVP award.  And I got to laugh a lot more than I would have expected.  I think for the clich&eacute; heavy genre that it's in...I must actually give the film 4 stars!!",4,Actually a lot funnier than I could ever have expected.,1245801600,"06 24, 2009",2009,5738,"['am',

Ryan Reynolds (X-Men Origins, Just Friends) is Andrew, her assistant.Sandra plays Margaret, who fires her competition and forces Ryan's character to skip his grandmother's 90th birthday and work on the weekend.Unfortunately for Margaret, she never handled that minor problem with the US Immigration Office and needs to be deported back to Canada and give up her job.I know, let's get ""married"" and then a quickie divorce and all is okay.The silliness ensues.Yes, this is a romantic comedy with the guy who hates the girl and then who gradually gets to like her.  And there are unusual characters and situations.What's pleasant about the film is not so much its predictability but the comedic timing and chemistry between Ryan and Sandra.  It's really great.  And no toilet humor, no raunchy stupid jokes that seem to be the current Hollywood standard.When Margaret gets on the wedding gown and gets the family heirloom from 'grandma', there is a tearful moment and a realization that she's never had a family or friends who have as much love and admiration than Andrew's family (who by the way practically own the whole town in Sitka, Alaska).Directed by Anne Fletcher, who also produced the Jennifer Lopez hit, The Wedding Planner.Most of the film takes place in Alaska and there are some great scenes and cinematography, though I understand it was actually filmed in the wilds of the New England states.Betty White, at 87 and still acting, steals the show with her wit and humor.A must-see, not your run of the mill average romantic comedy.Other Bullock Busters:Miss Congeniality (Deluxe Edition)Rush Hour 2 (Special Edition)The Lake House (Widescreen Edition)Ryan Reynolds' no Slouch:X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Two-Disc Edition + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]Just FriendsTwo Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place",4,Say YES to The Proposal!,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,1975,"['Better', 'expected', 'romantic', 'comedy.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'Ms.', 'Congeniality', 'et', 'al', 'wicked', 'witch', 'Ruick', 'book', 'firm', 'who', 'office', 'iron', 'hand', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Just', 'Friends', 'Andrew', 'assistant.Sandra', 'Margaret', 'who', 'competition', 'forces', 'Ryan', 'character', 'skip', 'grandmother', '90th', 'birthday', 'work', 'weekend.Unfortunately', 'Margaret', 'never', 'handled', 'minor', 'problem', 'US', 'Immigration', 'Office', 'be', 'deported', 'back', 'Canada', 'give', 'up', 'job.I', 'know', 'let', 'get', 'married', 'then', 'quickie', 'divorce', 'okay.The', 'silliness', 'ensues.Yes', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'guy', 'who', 'girl', 'then', 'who', 'gradually', 'like', 'are', 'unusual', 'characters', 'pleasant', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'predictability', 'comedic', 'timing', 'chemistry', 'Ryan', 'Sandra', 'really', 'great', 'toilet', 'humor', 'raunchy', 'stupid', 'jokes', 'seem', 'be', 'current', 'Hollywood', 'standard.When', 'Margaret', 'wedding', 'gown', 'family', 'heirloom', ""'grandma"", 'tearful', 'moment', 'realization', 'never', 'had', 'family', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'admiration', 'Andrew', 'family', 'who', 'way', 'practically', 'whole', 'town', 'Sitka', 'Alaska', '.Directed', 'Anne', 'Fletcher', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'hit', 'Wedding', 'Planner.Most', 'film', 'place', 'Alaska', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'cinematography', 'understand', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'wilds', 'New', 'England', 'states.Betty', 'White', '87', 'still', 'acting', 'show', 'wit', 'humor.A', 'must-see', 'not', 'run', 'mill', 'average', 'romantic', 'comedy.Other', 'Bullock', 'Busters', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'Rush', '2', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Lake', 'House', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Slouch', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'Two-Disc', 'Edition', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Just', 'FriendsTwo', 'Guys', 'Girl', 'Pizza', 'Place']",N/A

Sure, it is riddled with cliche, after cliche, and you have to suspend disbelief regarding some of the silly plotting, but I found it to be simply irresistible. It's been a while, since I have actually laughed out loud at a movie. A grin, maybe, but not teary-eyed, laughter; this film had me doing so in several scenes. It has also been a while since I have wanted to watch ANY movie more than once, but I'm ready to watch this one again.Sandra Bullock is adorable. It's a mystery to me, how she appears to grow more attractive with each movie.  Totally unfair!  If the ladies out there make their male partners, or friends, sit through this (mostly) 'chick flick,' they won't be disappointed, either.  They will be rewarded by watching Bullock in some revealing situations we haven't seen her in before.  Fortunately, they were handled with such fun and class, as would be expected from Bullock. However, the movie IS PG13 for sexual content, nudity, and language, so it is not for the younger audience.It is clear that Bullock and Reynolds are friends, because their chemistry together shines through. And, the secondary characters often share the spotlight. Betty White is as feisty and clever as ever, and such a complement to this film.

Yes, I laughed outloud often, and so did most of the audience. The comment frequently heard as the credits rolled was: ""Ooohhh, that was sooo goooood!"".The story: a tough lady-boss (Bullock) is being deported to Canada for willful non-compliance with the US immigration department. To save herself, she directs  her doormat of an assistant (Reynolds) to marry her. He reluctantly agrees to play along, after she ""helps"" him understand the virtues of being employed. If you think you know where this story is going... well, you are right. The ""happily ever after"" cannot be avoided. 'Tis a comedy after all...What is fresh is how skillfully the writers and the director allow the story to veer away from the ""happily ever after"" course, keeping us on the edge of our seats until the satisfying end, which we have known all along was bound to arrive.The chemistry between the two leads is another pleasant surprise. I am not a particular fan of either Bullock or Reynolds. Though each smoking hot and talented, neither has made many inspired project choices. However, the roles here suit the pair's natural acting styles reasonably well, which in turn further enhances the believability of their characters. The look of constipated doom on Reynold's face, as he's being informed he's engaged, is side-splitting! I do regret Bullock does not play ""mean"" better; the intended juxtaposition of her supposedly tough as nails character against her overly compliant secretary is lost at times. We are TOLD she is a witchy boss, and yet she comes accross nothing more then efficient (Sandra: call me! I'll give you some pointers. In return you can teach me how to find a secretary as hot as Reynolds ;0) ).Another gem in this comedy is Ms Betty White (of ""The Golden Girls""), an octogenarian in real life as well as playing one in ""The Proposal"". She has made an art of delivering ""campy"" with emotional intelligence. She does not dissapoint here either.Final verdict?

This follows Margaret, a hard nosed publishing editor, who is about to be deported when her visa expires and Andrew, her assistant who she blackmails into marrying her so she can stay in the country and keep her job. They then go to meet his family in Alaska and the real fun begins. Bullock shows yet again what a hilarious physical comedian she is and Reynolds has superb dead pan line delivery and this film had me laughing out loud at various points throughout. The chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds is obvious from the word go and they are a wonderful couple together on screen. This also has stellar performances from Mary Steenburgen and Betty White who play the mother and grandmother and who welcome Margaret into the family whole heartedly. This is a gentle film and doesn't sink to crass or overtly rude jokes to raise a laugh, instead it has real warmth and genuine humour and makes for just under two hours fun viewing.

The Blu is definitely a mixed bag though. I believe everyone knows of the story by now, and watching these two popular eye-candy actors do their thing keeps the masses entertained as they fall from hate to love of one another.The Blu clarity has the high budget feel throughout, but in this case to a fault. The green screen coloration is prevalent in any outdoor scene, at times almost appearing deliberately fake (the boat scene after she falls in the water was so apparent you just end up looking past it and focus on the heartfelt moment as was intended). On the second viewing I listened to the writer/director commentary to find out why they shot in Massachusetts instead of Alaska, and as usual it boiled down to money. They did get a few mountain panoramas but the 1080 only gets to show the real ones for a minute or two total. The 5.1 DTS sounds great and gets utilized the best during the strip/bar scene (hilarious sequence). The supplements are bittersweet and include:* The alternate ending. A way different style of ending that had some hilarious actor(s) completely deleted from the film. It is without the effects so you immediately notice how much green screen was being used - we are talking walls and cranes worth.* 6 minutes of deleted scenes. Understandable.* Set Antics as hosted by Aasif Mandvi. 6 minutes worth, you might get a couple chuckles out of it.* Digital copy of the film on disc 2.* Commentary by Fletcher and Chiarelli. They get some (sporadic) decent material on there, and by their own admission they admit theirs is how not to do a commentary, but I had to hear all the whys on filming location and volumes of effects for a romcom.The menu is a corny animated style, but all of the selections have an on/off for commentaries.I laughed and enjoyed the film, but the solid clarity shows all of the fine line failings throughout as each window background and exterior shot involving mountains becomes glaringly fake at the seams.

1274048,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002K0WBXW,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 5]","I was surprised by how much I enjoyed ""The Proposal"", the new rom-com starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.Andrew Paxton (Reynolds) is the assistant to an editor, Margaret Tate (Bullock) at a large publishing house in New York. Andrew has worked for Margaret for three years, three long, painful, dreadful years working for the ultimate Type-A personality as she works her way up the ladder. He puts up with Margaret because he wants to become a book publisher and he sees the path as her assistant. But this means he has to pick up coffee for her every morning, ordering his coffee exactly as she wants hers, in case something happens to hers. This means if she wants him to cancel a trip home for Gammy's (Betty White) 90th birthday, he will. This means that as soon as he knows she is on her way into the office, he IMs the other staff and the news spreads like wildfire. Margaret, poised to take over as head of the publishing house, is summoned to the boss' office. Her work visa has run into some roadblocks and she has to return to Canada and will lose her job. As she tries to convince her bosses she will take care of it, Andrew enters to tell her about a phone call and she comes up with a plan. She and Andrew will be married, solving everyone's problems. But this is the first Andrew has heard about it and he can barely stand the sight of her. He agrees, but only after she agrees to help him. They decide to go to his family home, in Alaska, to tell his mom (Mary Steenburgen), dad (Craig T. Nelson) and Gammy the news. When they arrive, Margaret learns Andrew's family owns most of the town. Mom and Gammy are surprised, but thrilled to learn of the news and insist they get married there, during their visit. An overworked and suspicious INS Agent (Gilbert O'Hare) watches their every move. Add Ramone (Oscar Nunez), the town's bartender, caterer, shop worker and stripper to the mix and the comedy begins.Directed by Anne Fletcher and written by Peter Chiarelli, ""The Proposal"" just seems more real and less sitcomy than most of the rom-coms out there. Sure, there are contrivances in the story, to keep everything moving and to get the characters into the right places for the comedy bits, but the characters are more interesting and believable, and a lot of time is spent setting up the environment for the story giving everything a more believable feel.Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are a nice pairing on screen. Bullock has proven she is a gifted comedienne, able to make us laugh and enjoy her performances. Unfortunately, she has given us some dreadful performances in films that were painful to sit through and watch. In ""Proposal"", she plays a super Type-A personality who is not a nice person. Used to getting her way, she is abrupt and unlikable. She also puts her assistant through hell because she realizes he can use this position as a stepping-stone to a more prominent role within the publishing industry. She holds this over his head, controlling his life, afraid to let him move on in case he is able to leap frog over her.The first time we meet Margaret, most of the office cowers out of her way, to avoid any contact with her. This is a funny and interesting way of establishing her character. When Andrew spills coffee on his shirt, he bribes another worker into switching with him. This is also an amusing change for Bullock as she usually plays nice and sweet. In ""Proposal"", she plays the flip side of her normal persona, giving her a chance to give Margaret a lot of development and as her character changes, we come to like a woman we initially disliked.Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew and I am almost to the point where I have to label Reynolds an underappreciated comedic actor. After his funny turn in ""Just Friends"" and his small supporting role in ""Adventureland"", Reynolds has proven that he can do comedy well, making his characters interesting, believable and human. With ""Proposal"", he only serves to solidify this opinion. He seems to be playing Andrew as the straight man, but still manages to elicit some laughs. What this duality does is give the character more depth than you might expect.Forced into a situation he didn't know anything about, he uses it to his advantage. But then, he realizes how hurt his family will be and has second thoughts, trying to justify everything he is doing. Reynolds does a nice job of portraying Andrew wrestling with this moral dilemma.It seems like every romantic comedy has to include a certain number of 'wacky' people, to amp up the laughs. In ""Proposal"", Betty White plays Gammy, the matriarch of the family. I was glad to see that White was cast to play a character that is both funny and touching without being particularly bawdy, In many films, older people often seem to provide humor with some ribald remark, or to flirt with a twenty something guy. Look at the old lady. Isn't it funny that she thinks a young man could love her. This type of humor just seems sad and worn out. What this film does have is Ramone, played by Oscar Nunez (TV's ""The Office""). Ramone first appears as a waiter at a party at Andrew's family home. The whole family seems to know Ramone and he flirts with Margaret. As the story progresses, we soon realize Ramone is a man with many jobs who wears many hats. He pops up in increasingly odd circumstances, making us laugh.Craig T. Nelson plays Joe Paxton, Andrew's dad and the owner of most of the town in Alaska where they live. He wants Andrew to return home and take over the family business, which leads to a lot of animosity between them. Andrew really wants to be an editor and his dad can't understand why all he wants to do is sit around and 'read books'. This storyline is included to give Andrew another human edge (his father is pretty straight laced and wants him to come home) but the character makes a choice, which seems to make him the most cold-hearted person in the world. I honestly don't believe any father who actually loves their son could do the same thing. It robs his character of any empathy and makes him unredeemable.Mary Steenburgen is good as Andrew's mom. But she seems to be included simply to act as part of a two-person female Greek chorus. She and Gammy go everywhere and seem to do everything together,""The Proposal"" is cute, romantic, funny and more believable than you might expect. The perfect film to share a warm weekend afternoon with your significant other.",3,"3 1/2 - Funny, frothy and an enjoyable rom-com",1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,6430,"['was', 'surprised', 'how',

A (proposed) marriage of convenience turns into something different as the reluctant partners are forced to live together. You might want to know the film is helmed by Anne Fletcher known for her ""Step up"" and ""27 Dresses.""Margaret (Sandra Bullock) is an executive editor of a New York book publishing company - and she is not the most popular person in the company, a little tamer version of Miranda, the character Meryl Streep played in ""The Devil Wears Prada."" And now she is in trouble. Learning that she is being deported to Canada (where she came from), Margaret says before her employer that in fact she and her long-suffering assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) are getting married.Andrew agrees to the fraudulent marriage on condition that he will get promoted. She accepts it, but there is still a big problem. Margaret and Andrew both have to prove that their marriage is not a fake before the immigration agent Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare). So they fly to Andrew's home in Sitka, Alaska, where Margaret is welcomed by his family - and of course, none of the family members, Andrew's mother Grace (Mary Steenburgen), father Joe (Craig T. Nelson) and Granma Annie (Betty White) knows nothing about the truth.The premise of ""The Proposal"" is slightly reminiscent of such films as ""Green Card."" In fact, the storyline of ""The Proposal"" sounds familiar to those fans who love old-fashioned Hollywood films. Someone you hate most turns out to be your perfect match. The difference is the film's sexual content (I am talking about the slapstick-like semi-nude scene of Sandra Bullock) and the ""question-and-answer"" scenes at the end credit, as well as some funny comedic set-pieces involving a dog and a cell phone snatched by an eagle.While the premise is contrived and the story predictable, the chemistry between the two stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds is palpable and believable.

1274057,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002K0WBXW,Turfseer,"[2, 11]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***For those who haven't seen 'The Proposal', the plot is rather simple.  Faced with being deported to her native Canada, publishing business career woman Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock), proposes to her assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) that she marry him, in order to save her job and offer him a chance at promotion. The film has been compared to the 2009 dramedy 'The Devil Wears Prada'. Ostensibly, they both are about smug career women who are universally hated by their employees. But Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly is a multi-dimensional portrait based on a real person and Sandra Bullock's 'Margaret Tate' is a dopey caricature.Many internet posters have condemned 'The Proposal' for its predictability. Sure enough, Margaret Tate eventually comprehends the error of her ways and finally softens up; but it's what happens before the predicable ending (the 'softening up') that relegates the film to the trash heap.There was a time when Sandra Bullock actually showed some talent as a comic actor. Consider Miss Congeniality--the film was humorous due to the cleverness of the fish out of water premise. Sandra's FBI agent character had to adapt in the prim and proper beauty pageant world. And we were attracted to Sandra since her character was realistically tough and confident.Not so in 'The Proposal'. You would think that a tough as nails editor-in-chief would know how to handle herself, especially in the rarefied world of the Paxton family--both Tate and the Paxtons are quite well off. But no, Bullock plays Tate as a buffoon, someone to laugh at. Somehow, being in the more rural atmosphere of Sitka, Alaska, is supposed to turn Tate into a total klutz. Not only is she unable to efficiently move her luggage or climb down a ladder but she also can't swim! While Miranda Priestly was arrogant and sometimes petty, she also had an aura of competency that made her an attractive and interesting character. Until her sudden epiphanies toward the climax of 'The Proposal', Tate is completely petty and never shows any sign of competence. Take for example, the idiotic scene where the family dog is snatched by an eagle; eventually Tate saves the dog but she's more concerned about her cell phone, after the eagle flies away with it.It's easy to understand why Bullock would be attracted to the 'straw man' character of Margaret Tate. As the dictionary tells us--a straw man is a ""fabricated or conveniently weak or innocuous person, object, matter, etc., used as a seeming adversary or argument."" The shrewd businesswoman that she is, Bullock realizes how the masses (the film going public) despise such characters as Tate, since most of us have encountered such arrogant people one time or another during our employment history. In reality, such people never realize the 'error' of their ways and usually are rewarded for their amoral behavior (take Miranda Priestly in 'The Devil Wears Prada' as the perfect example). Since the masses can't face reality, they would rather indulge in wish fulfillment by cheering on the comeuppance of a straw man. And that's exactly what Bullock has done here--provided a buffoon that the masses can sneer at--while she knows full well that a real tough as nails editor-in-chief would never be anything like a Margaret Tate who ""hates shopping and sightseeing"" and hasn't had sex for a year and a half!Before 'The Proposal' gets all mushy with the failed marriage ceremony and Ryan Reynolds rushing back to NYC where he convinces Bullock that he's truly fallen in love with her, numerous bloggers and internet posters have taken note of many other unfunny scenes in 'The Proposal', that crop up before the sentimental denouement. A few that come to mind include: Bullock and Reynolds clumsily falling over each other while in the nude, Bullock being entertained by an amateur Hispanic 'Chippendale's' stripper and Betty White playing the grandmother dressed up as a Native American, performing a bizarre Native American dance for Bullock (followed by her equally bizarre hip hop dance in response).Despite Ryan Reynold's sincere performance as Andrew Paxton, the character also doesn't make much sense. Paxton supposedly holds himself as being true to himself (as well as being an anti-materialist) when he rejects his father's demand to come back home and take over the family business. But at the same time, he's willing to compromise his values by accepting Tate's illegal (and immoral) proposal, in order to further his career.Even if one's 'heart strings' are pulled by the sudden transformation of the lovers' affection for each other at the film's climax, the bulk of 'The Proposal' is 'comedy' of the lowest sort. And Bullock too has hit new lows by agreeing to be part of this enterprise. The next time around, she should look for more excellent screenplays.

1274062,A1C80B497LCYKA,B002K0WBXW,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[3, 4]","Sandra Bullock was a hot commodity in 2009. This is a very attractive comedy, with locations in New York and Alaska; a terrific cast in Ryan Reynolds (Wolverine, Definitely Maybe, Van Wilder), Mary Steenburgen (Four Christmases, Back To The Future Part III), Craig T. Nelson (The Incredibles, Coach), and Betty White (The Golden Girls, The Mary Tyler Moore Show); and a pretty good script. A couple that starts out hating each other and ends up loving each other is a good formula, as some of the most famous comedies - like The Philadelphia Story - and even dramas - such as Gone With The Wind - prove. In this case, Bullock is Reynold's slave-driver publishing boss, whom everyone fears and loathes, but Reynolds especially. When it looks like Bullock is going to be deported back to Canada because of an immigration problem, she blackmails Reynolds into marrying her, in spite of their age difference. Things really heat up when he takes her home to Alaska to meet his family, with an immigration official hot on their trail.I'll never understand why comedy writers and directors always include at least one tasteless scene in their films. In this case, it's the performance by local male stripper Ramone, played by Oscar Nunez. It's as if they want to make sure we realize that they don't respect us, so they give us a scene that you would have to be trailer trash to appreciate. Then there's the obligatory skin scene, which in this case involves the totally unbelievable coincidence of both Bullock and Reynolds being naked, slamming into each other, and ending up on the floor together. Of course, they still hate each other at this point, so they're not supposed to like it. And finally, as a tribute to bad TV, we have a bizarre scene with Betty White in the middle of the woods dressed in Indian garb, chanting to Mother Nature, with Sandra Bullock contributing to the ceremony by singing and dancing to the dirty lyrics of a rap song. In spite of these idiotic inclusions, this is a very likable film, primarily because, what's not to like about Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.

So when my dear husband brought this home one night, I was quite skeptical, thinking I wasn't going to enjoy it. Well, I was wrong! ""The Proposal"" is a well-cast and credibly acted romantic comedy with two leads that share genuine chemistry and an ensemble cast that is quite simply a delight to watch.Sandra Bullock whom I have enjoyed watching in movies like ""While you were sleeping"" (and which I consider an all-time classic) and ""Practical Magic"" plays a tough as nails editor, Margaret, who is reviled by her underlings. Margaret faces a predicament when her visa expires (she is a Canadian) and faces the unpleasant prospect of being deported. She comes up with a quick fix solution - tell her boss and others that she is engaged to her assistant, an aspiring author, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds)who is forced to go along with her plans under threat of losing his job and never being published. Before long, the pair find themselves heading to the scenic Sitka, Alaska, a beautiful seaside town where Andrew's family lives. Turns out Andrew's family is not only prominent but very wealthy, comprising dad Joe (Craig T. Nelson), mom Grace (Mary Steenburgen) and grandma Annie (Betty White, still at her feisty best). Andrew's family embrace Margaret, though Joe is cynical of their romance and is hell bent on keeping Andrew on Sitka, to take over the Paxton empire after his retirement.Typical of other romantic comedies, the pair soon discover common ground, and Margaret's ice queen veneer slowly thaws, and the rest of the story deals with the pair's romantic misadventures and conclusion. What made this an engaging and fun watch was the believable chemistry between Reynolds and Bullock - they truly seem at ease with each other, be it whilst engaged in verbal sparring or easy, casual banter. Betty White hams it up as Grandma Annie, and Mary Steenburgen and Craig T Nelson play their roles with conviction. The cinematography is beautiful and the dialogue is well-written, resulting in many genuinely laugh out loud moments. This is a wonderful romantic comedy that is sure to brighten up a listless, gloomy day.
