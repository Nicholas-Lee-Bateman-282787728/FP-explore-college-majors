It was also great to see Jeremy Irons taking to his part with such panache as well as Dennis Quaid. The two female leads Zoe Saldana and Olivia Wilde were also excellent and they truly added to the quality of the film. I see that Bradley C produced this film and what an excellent choice he made.

Doubly, maybe more so, for anyone with any pretensions to write professionally for some audience that he or she has in his or her head to make that big breakthrough and earn enough money to get out of some rustic garret, to be able to look the landlord in the eye and to eat something more original than day-old bread. That little struggle for success in today&#8217;s ravishingly competitive dwindling book market (old style) is one of the little points made in this entertaining and engaging film under review appropriately named, ah, The Words.The plotline of the film unfolds under the old standby-telling a story within a story within a story and with the limitations of that trope the film works, works well, as a study about the frustrations and temptations of the modern writer. A well-known novelist (Dennis Quiad) who is in something of a mid-career slump gives a public presentation of his latest successful novel. The plot of that novel is that a certain young New York writer (yes, much of writing is autobiographical) was working, and waiting, for his big break out. Working and waiting with his beautiful wife whom he took on a honeymoon to Paris where she found a writer&#8217;s briefcase that she purchased thinking it might be a good omen. Sometime later after they got home to New York and he was in deep writer&#8217;s funk he found in that Parisian briefcase a tattered and torn anonymous manuscript which had all the ingredients of a major new novel. After about a minute of reflection he decided to copy the manuscript and claim it as his own work. After cajoling publishers the thing was finally published and was a smash critical and popular hit. He then had that fame and fortune that he had craved for so long.Well almost, see the story-line that he, ah, stole, was the effort of a budding American soldier-writer (Jeremy Irons) in World War II who got the writing craze as will happen and also a craze for a French girl he met while doing garrison duty. Their ill-fated love affair (including the then French wife leaving the manuscript behind in that briefcase that Rory&#8217;s wife had subsequently purchased) was the central theme of that novel. Well, Jeremy although no longer writing had a strong interest in letting Rory know he knew that it was not his work. That tension, between whether Rory should admit the plagiarism or just continue to draw revenue and probably generous advances on future books, was what drove the latter portion of the film. Yeah, and you say the writing game is not such a tough racket.

It is easy to get drawn into the movie, and to understand where the main character is coming from when he steals the words.  The movie is told like a novel, and moves at a pace that makes sense for this type of story.  I can see how some people wouldn't understand why this movie is so intriguing and fascinating.  As someone who  has a degree in print journalism, and who has spent years wondering what happened to my ""voice"", I felt myself being taken on a journey with this movie.  I loved the stories within stories.  I liked how the movie kept going back and forth from present day to the old days in Paris, and showing us both sides of the story at the same time.  Yes, the ending is a little disappointing because it is left open-ended and you have to decide for yourself what happened, but it is well worth the watch.  I was okay with the ending because I felt that it was somewhat fitting.  If you're a writer watching this movie, you should be able to write your own ending in your mind.  How do you think things played out?  I would recommend this to my friends who are writers, and possibly creative types.  I probably wouldn't recommend it to other family and friends because they may not appreciate it.  I'm glad I decided to watch this movie on my own, and not with my husband.

1596398,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B009H3LN8Y,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","I am a fan of ambiguities.  I know that usually when I start a review with that statement I then start to gripe about the extent of the ambiguity within the film and chastise it to the point where it appears as though I really don't care for them at all, but the truth of the matter is that ambiguities are important in allowing the viewer to interpret the story in a way that effects them or moves them the most.  Sadly though, if a film or book or whatever fails to manipulate ambiguities in the right direction, they can just be perceived as confusing.`The Words' kind of falls in that area.The film opens with a famed author named Clay Hammond reading his newest novel `The Words' to an anxious crowd.  Clay narrates (in rather lackluster wording, so I'm assuming the book itself was lazily written) the story of Rory Jansen, a young aspiring writer who is downtrodden by his love of words but his lack of ability to string them correctly.  He has talent, but he lacks that something special that makes anyone what to publish his work.  His wife is devoted and supports him, but he loathes his lack of success.  Then he gets his hands on an unpublished manuscript that is apparently perfect (seriously, the reaction by everyone who reads the book as if it were the second coming is almost comical and nonsensical) and he just has to feel that it came from him, so he transcribes it word for word onto his computer.  A misunderstanding later and he's in front of an editor and being heralded as the next big thing in literature.  Soon after taking credit for something he didn't write himself, he is confronted by an old man who tells him the truth about the life he stole.The story had major potential.  Plagiarism is nothing new, but it is rarely confronted and the format with which this film approaches it is unique and inspired, I just wish that it hadn't been so...forceful.  The melodramatics made the prose feel cheap, the narration from both Quaid and then Irons was unnecessary and actually took away from the film because it added cheesy layers of detail that felt manipulative.  The acting was mediocre, with Cooper putting in yet another underdeveloped performance (I've yet to see `Silver Linings Playbook', so I won't judge his Oscar nomination yet) and Quaid and Irons are underused and basically phone it in.  Irons sounded like he was channeling Dustin Hoffman's Captain Hook, so it was really hard to take him seriously.But alas, the worst aspect of this film was the ending, which was so rushed and just `there'.  It left this open door of `what just happened' and `what is really going on' that either comes together in `oh, that's interesting' or `that's plain stupid' and I'm not sure which (not that either is that great considering that `interesting' can still be perceived as nothing better than `unexpected').Bah.Zoe Saldana needs a better agent because she has a lot of talent but shows it off in poorly conceived and constructed films.  She's the reason to see this, and yet she does nothing of real note so then again, you can skip it.  I'm giving this a C-.  It had potential.  It could have been better, different, more fulfilled, but the elements just didn't come together as expected.

At the risk of sounding like someone who prefers generic action/suspense flicks (which I actually do but I'm actually open to many different types of films) I found the Words completely boring the entire way through.  Making it a drama was a mistake since the way it is isn't sufficient or interesting enough, however the lackluster writing is inexcusably bad and the most offensive thing about it.  The writing *never once* tries to venture down territory that's exciting in any way.  Everything's kept very simplistic and down to earth with zero attempt to be creative or at least perk my interest.  It's obviously going for a subtle approach, but it's *too* subtle.  Taking subtlety and throwing in an uninteresting story is a losing combination.I kept hoping Bradley Cooper would eventually pick up the pace or at least do *something* to make the film watchable but he never does.  Sitting around and being depressed, frustrated or exhausted because he can't write the perfect story doesn't make for interesting storytelling.  I've seen the same idea used before in other films.  Perhaps this is an accurate portrayal of a writer who struggles and eventually resorts to stealing another persons work, however it's done in such a plodding uneventful way that I can't fathom how anybody can give the film more than 3 stars.  I did like the ""mini"" story of the other writer meeting up with Bradley on a park bench and revealing a horrible story concerning the tragic history of a man who meets a woman, falls in love and they have a baby together (""mini"" in quotation marks since it's actually a fairly lengthy chunk of the story).  This part was interesting despite how clich&eacute;d, phony and annoyingly poetic it felt, but it was a highlight at least.I dunno guys.  It was nice to see Bradley Cooper and Ron Rifkin together again from their Alias past which was a pleasant surprise, but otherwise the Words would have clearly benefited by taking the script in an entirely different more thrilling direction.  How about making Bradley Cooper and his wife's lives absolutely miserable for Bradley stealing somebody else's work?  That would have been a MUCH better direction to take the film, because as it stands it severely lacks substance so I can't recommend it.",2,words escape me,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,2306,"['Simply', 'put', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Words', 'risk', 'sounding', 'someone', 'who', 'generic', 'action/suspense', 'flicks', 'actually', 'do', ""'m"", 'actually', 'open', 'many', 'different', 'types', 'films', 'found', 'Words', 'completely', 'boring', 'entire', 'way', 'Making', 'drama', 'was', 'mistake', 'way', ""n't"", 'sufficient', 'interesting', 'enough', 'however', 'lackluster', 'writing', 'inexcusably', 'bad', 'most', 'offensive', 'thing', 'writing', '*never', 'once*', 'tries', 'venture', 'down', 'territory', 'exciting', 'way', 'Everything', 'kept', 'very', 'simplistic', 'down', 'earth', 'zero', 'attempt', 'be', 'creative', 'least', 'perk', 'interest', 'obviously', 'going', 'subtle', 'approach', '*too*', 'subtle', 'Taking', 'subtlety', 'throwing', 'uninteresting', 'story', 'losing', 'combination.I', 'kept', 'hoping', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'would', 'eventually', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'least', 'do', 'make', 'film', 'watchable', 'never', 'Sitting', 'around', 'being', 'depressed', 'frustrated', 'exhausted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'perfect', 'story', ""n't"", 'make', 'interesting', 'storytelling', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'idea', 'used', 'other', 'films', 'Perhaps', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'writer', 'who', 'eventually', 'resorts', 'stealing', 'persons', 'work', 'however', 'done', 'such', 'plodding', 'uneventful', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'how', 'anybody', 'can', 'give', 'film', 'more', '3', 'stars', 'did', 'like', 'mini', 'story', 'other', 'writer', 'meeting', 'up', 'Bradley', 'park', 'bench', 'revealing', 'horrible', 'story', 'concerning', 'tragic', 'history', 'man', 'who', 'woman', 'love', 'have', 'baby', 'together', 'mini', 'quotation', 'marks', 'actually', 'fairly', 'lengthy', 'chunk', 'story', 'part', 'was', 'interesting', 'how', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'phony', 'annoyingly', 'poetic', 'felt', 'was', 'highlight', 'least.I', 'dunno', 'guys', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'together', 'again', 'Alias', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'otherwise', 'Words', 'would', 'have', 'clearly', 'benefited', 'taking', 'script', 'entirely', 'different', 'more', 'thrilling', 'direction', 'How', 'making', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'wife', 'lives', 'absolutely', 'miserable', 'Bradley', 'stealing', 'somebody', 'else', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'MUCH', 'better', 'direction', 'take', 'film', 'severely', 'substance', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend']",N/A

It to me seemed he had made so many changes from his mistakethat he is so flawed he even changed his name. That to me shows how much he had been almost destroyedno matter what success he got afterwards. He seemed to not realize that even the last thing we see him writewas a beautiful story. And he owed that to the kindness of the man he wronged.Bradley Cooper was excellent and Jeremy Irons was fantastic.All the characters to me were excellent. Their acting was wonderful.But him changing his name seemed to me to tell a lot about how muchthis man's life was forever changed and how he continued to feel about himself.Even if many of his works after his chose were great.It seemed he never found the peace the wronged man did.That is why the end did not bother me.It seemed he lost the love he wanted too. But nothing he gained ever gave him back his peace.I did feel for him. His wife was right. He should have listened to her.If she was willing to forgive him. Why could he not forgive himself.That is why to me what the girl said to him was very insightful.And I still had hope he may get his wife back. It was clear to me that is all he wanted.All he needed. But he chose to not forgive himself. Also he never even dedicated anything to the man he wronged.How could that have hurt him. It may have helped him.

Among many of the truthful moments of the film, it captures the pressure of living up to expectations from loved ones as well as society overall...especially as a struggling writer. It also truly captures the frustration of breaking into the so-called ""industry."" And how even if you've spent years mastering your craft and taken the time to carve out the perfect script...there's really no guarantee  because, in the celebrity filled world we live in, no one in the publishing world will even give you a chance because at the end of the day you're an unknown. And what do you do? You've got the perfect script...you're a stone's throw away from living in the street with your wife. You can't borrow any more money. You have a family who depends on you. Again...really well told and well acted by Bradley Cooper and Zoey Saldana (as well as Jeremy Irons and Dennis Quaid). Although the movie talks about plagiarism, and how far a struggling writer would have to be pushed to even consider stealing some one else's work, what I like about this movie is that at its core it explores the nuances of not just being a writer but what it's like to be an artist.

1596424,A1JZZLIVXGJSIB,B009H3LN8Y,CinemaMinor,"[2, 3]","I watched this movie a while ago (streamed at home) and forgot to review it, then it popped up as a recommendation from Amazon and it occurred to me that I never wanted to sit through ""The Words"" again. Many of the two-star reviews complain about the ending, and that's what ultimately killed this movie for me too; there was no pay-off.  Instead, I was like, ""Wait a minute...what did I just watch?""  The ""twist"" in the plot seemed more like a trick than actual storytelling.  I find it ironic that the movie is supposed to be about the art of crafting a story, yet that's its weakest trait.It's hard to talk about ""The Words"" without giving too much away.  Everyone who has seen the trailer knows that Bradley Cooper plays a writer, Rory Jansen, who somehow takes someone else's (played by Jeremy Irons) story and makes it his own.  So there's Jeremy Irons providing the backstory to his character's story after he confronts Rory's theivery.  Parallel to this, Dennis Quaid is telling Rory's story during a lecture by means of reading from a book his character has written about it.  A story within a story within a story with TWO separate streams of voice-over narration.  Not exactly a recipe for titillation and it also breaks the good writer's code of ""show, don't tell.""In terms of why I remained at an arm's distance from the film -- which I was the entire time -- I did not find Bradley Cooper's character easy to like, and not just because of his questionable moral code.  He wasn't fleshed out.  All of the characters seemed two-deminsional in that ""we exist to prove a point"" type way...players on a chess board.  Or in this case, on a checker board because what goes on during the movie is just not that sophisticated.  For example, when Rory and his significant other, played by Zoe Saldana, move into an apartment together, they fall onto the mattress they've just hauled up the stairs and share a romantic interlude (never seen that scene in any other movie) during which they discuss their hopes and dreams.  And now we too know their hopes and dreams.  The entire movie is that straightforward -- until the end when it's like, ""Huh?""At 96 minutes, the movie is short by today's standards, although I was expecting more to happen.  I was especially expecting more to happen during the flashbacks from Jeremy Irons of post-WW II Europe.  What goes on there is nothing that hasn't been written in a Hemingway novel, except with much, much less action.  And in all of this talking about writing, there is no inkling provided as to what's so great about the book that Jeremy Irons's character wrote and Bradley Cooper's character stole -- other than people saying how great the book is.  Again, I found it hard to get absorbed.I do really respect all of the actors in ""The Words"" which is why I gave it two stars. It is also beautifully shot and everyone and everything in it is nice to look at.In terms of ""The Words"" being about the craft of writing, the best way to do that craft justice is to tell a well put-together story that respects the reader, or in this case, audience.  I do not feel that ""The Words"" succeeds at that.  It's one thing to want to comment on the blurring of reality and fiction, truth and lies...it's another to not make it clear to your audience which is which.  After all, this isn't ""Doubt.""

1596429,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,B009H3LN8Y,CryWolf854,"[5, 7]","The Words is a confusing mess of a movie. It tries way to hard to be a dense mystery, a human drama, and a literary masterpiece. The basic outline is that it's a story within a story within a story.Clay Hammond (Denis Quaide; The Rookie, Cold Creek Manor) is a best selling author reading from his new novel about struggling author Rory Jensen (Bradley Cooper; The Hangover, He's Just Not That Into You) who gets a break when his wife Dora (sexy Zoey Saldana; Columbiana, Avatar) buys his a leather satchel containing an unpublished novel. So what does he do? He steals it, types it up word for word, publishes it, and becomes the next Phillip Roth. Unfortunately for Rory, in a chance meeting that defies all logic, he meets an Old Man (played to perfection by Jeremy Irons; M. Butterfly, Beautiful Creatures) who not only wrote the original novel but goes on in a lengthy second act about the origins of the story. Now, instead of going to the media about how Rory is a fake, the Old Man wants nothing out of it. But Rory is haunted by this enigmatic stranger and then comes clean to his wife and publisher. What becomes of Rory and the Old Man? Nothing out right. But this is where Clay comes in. While openly flirting with a fan (Olivia Wilde; Turistas, Cowboys and Aliens), Clay then comes clean on his own involvement with the theft but clearly in a poetic way. Is he only reading fiction or is he, in fact, telling how he became a famous author due to an act of plagiarism? The answer is obvious but let's just be as dense as this movie tries to be.While on the surface, the movie does provide an ample amount of fine performances. It just takes to much time in selling itself. A lot of the Old Man's story could have been summed up in about ten minutes instead of running over half an hour of tedious padding. The movie died a quick, quiet death at the box office and its not hard to see why. I'd say rent if your interested in seeing some well played characters or in case you're having a case of insomnia and need a quick fix.Post ScriptI didn't realize there were two different versions of The Words available.

1596434,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B009H3LN8Y,David R. Eastwood,"[4, 5]","THE WORDS (2012) is a shallow, unconvincing, and unsatisfying look at the effects of a literary theft. (Anyone interested in a deep, chilling, and tragic tale of literary theft can spend a few hours reading about the exposure and suicide of Jerzy Kosinski, the award-winning supposed author of BEING THERE, BLIND DATE, COCKPIT, THE DEVIL TREE, THE PAINTED BIRD, STEPS, and several other acclaimed novels.)THE WORDS opens with a highly respected author (Dennis Quaid) reading the early chapters of his latest novel to a New York City audience that includes an adoring female fan/literature grad student (Olivia Wilde). Within Quaid's novel (which is dramatized for us) a would-be novelist (Bradley Cooper), who has sponged off his father while living with his girlfriend (Zoe Saldana), takes a menial job at a literary agency, marries his girlfriend, honeymoons in Paris, and writes at night ""while the city is silent"" (when is THAT?). Then, inside an old briefcase bought in Paris, he finds the long-lost manuscript of another man's supposedly great unpublished novel and has it published under his own name. This stolen novel becomes a best-seller and receives great critical acclaim. And then an Old Man, the real author, tracks down the fake author and talks with him on a park bench.The Old Man (Jeremy Irons) tells the fake author parts of his life-story (also dramatized, with his younger self and his young French wife played by Ben Barnes and Nora Arnezeder) and moralizes, ""We all make choices. The hard thing is to live with them, and there ain't nobody that can help you with that.""While many of us (rightly) will be highly skeptical about the literary qualities of the novel being read by Dennis Quaid and the novel that was written by the Old Man (we ""see"" it being typed - just a first-draft, with no revisions or erasures, and we can even read a few passages as they are typed), the real focus of this movie should be on the consequences of the fake author's choices. Will the Old Man punish him? Will others punish him? Will his own conscience punish him? Will he somehow redeem himself?Or none of the above? The reading ends, and Dennis Quaid goes back to his apartment with Olivia Wilde, who has flirtatiously begged him to tell her more.She asks a few questions about the rest of the story, which Quaid fends off with clich&eacute;s. And the film ""concludes"" with a camera trick, juxtaposing earlier images of the thieving, fake novelist with images of Quaid in his apartment with Olivia Wilde ... perhaps implying that his own new novel is largely autobiographical, based (perhaps) on his own theft of another man's work, and that he (perhaps) is now still fumblingly living with his bad, bad, bad choices.Quaid, doing a VERY broad parody of a leering, salivating, middle-aged lecher with dark, dyed hair, is quite effective, as is Jeremy Irons as a dying old man who (with the help of some plants) mysteriously SOMEHOW got over his bitter disappointment. All of the young people ""look pretty"" - but their stories (plural) are far too shallow and incomplete for most of us to be deeply moved, and the portrayals of working novelists creating their wonderful novels are preposterous, even ludicrous. I know: I taught literature and creative writing for 37 years, and so far over 85 of my own pieces of fiction have been published.One other comment the Old Man (Irons) made to the fake novelist (Cooper) was, ""Don't bullsh*t an old bullsh*ter.""

The fact that his act would be difficult to ever prove or prosecute only makes things worse for Rory Jansen in many ways. The various additional elements of suspense and romance help to create a unique combination.Interesting plot-structure: No huge twists or surprises, but everything fits together with slow, subtle tension. The acting ranges from tepid to quite good. Certain details are also important; it might be a good idea, for example, to freeze-frame and read the rejection letters that Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper) receives toward the beginning. A lot of people apparently don't like the way THE WORDS ends, but I sure do. Along with ""the old man"" (Jeremy Iron)'s embedded tale, the conversations between best-selling author Clay Hammond (Dennis Quaid) and fan/aspiring author Daniella (Olivia Wilde--looking great and playing her character very well) are easily the most engaging aspects of this film.Anyone with interests in fiction writing, the publishing industry, and/or related subjects will probably find THE WORDS a compelling enough film; those without such interests, however, may find it pretty dull.

His wife finds it and urges him to publish it, which he does, in order to tell the world about:~ Jack, a soldier in France during WWII, who writes about his lost loves.It raises some interesting questions as a writer (which I am). Rory does not intentionally steal the book, but he allows it to happen. He doesn't fess up when he has the chance. And then when he does fess up - thanks to his conscious - and an old man following him around - he doesn't really, fully confess his ""crime"". And if there is truly nothing new under the sun, might he not have come up with the story on his own at some point? And who has he really harmed by publishing the book under his own name?The stories truly were the best part of the movie; I recommend it because of them. However, the acting was okay, the cinematography was okay, and I really did not like the ending.

1596458,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B009H3LN8Y,FNDNreview,"[19, 22]","In The Words, Bradley Cooper stars as Rory Jansen, a struggling writer that stumbles upon a briefcase which contains a story that holds the key to launching his career.  Shortly after publishing the story, success launches his career.  However, an old man (Jeremy Irons) confronts Jansen about publishing this 'thought to be' lost story and from there a plot line within a plot line within a plot line unfolds - all of which revolves around the overlying theme: fame/success vs. choice/consequence.  Yes, there's also some romance.  Zoe Saldana, Olivia Wilde, and Dennis Quaid co-star.It's easy to say the plot becomes predictable about half way through the film (and it does), but films don't always have to be about the sudden 'twist' ending that nobody saw coming.  Sometimes it's nice to watch a film and think about the meaning behind the story - in this case it's about the choices we make that affect our lives and the lives of the people around us.  It's especially interesting to see what lengths some people will go to in order to touch success.In any event, that are several major/minor problems with this film (depending how picky your are about your entertainment) that keep it from being a great film - namely the sub-par/predictable plot, mixed with the lack of chemistry between characters (noticeably Wilde and Quaid).  However, these issues don't take away from the film experience or emotional impact of the film.  Bradley Cooper does a remarkable job and is slowly becoming the next Brad Pitt, while Jeremy Irons shows that even though he's aging, he still has top-notch acting ability.Friday Night Date Night ReviewFollow us at: Facebook.com/FNDNReview",3,'The Words' will speak to you,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,1673,"['Words', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Rory', 'Jansen', 'struggling', 'writer', 'briefcase', 'story', 'key', 'launching', 'career', 'Shortly', 'publishing', 'story', 'success', 'career', 'However', 'old', 'man', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Jansen', 'publishing', ""'thought"", 'be', 'lost', 'story', 'plot', 'line', 'plot', 'line', 'plot', 'line', 'overlying', 'theme', 'fame/success', 'vs.', 'choice/consequence', 'Yes', 'also', 'romance', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'co-star.It', 'easy', 'say', 'plot', 'predictable', 'way', 'film', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'be', 'sudden', ""'twist"", 'ending', 'nobody', 'saw', 'coming', 'Sometimes', 'nice', 'watch', 'film', 'think', 'meaning', 'story', 'case', 'choices', 'make', 'affect', 'lives', 'lives', 'people', 'especially', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'lengths', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'order', 'touch', 'success.In', 'event', 'are', 'several', 'major/minor', 'problems', 'film', 'depending', 'how', 'picky', 'are', 'entertainment', 'keep', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'namely', 'sub-par/predictable', 'plot', 'mixed', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'noticeably', 'Wilde', 'Quaid', 'However', 'issues', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'film', 'experience', 'emotional', 'impact', 'film', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'remarkable', 'job', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'next', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'even', 'aging', 'still', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'ability.Friday', 'Night', 'Date', 'Night', 'ReviewFollow', 'Facebook.com/FNDNReview']",N/A

The story is narrated by Clay Hammond (Dennis Quaid) who has written a book about a man Rory (Bradley Cooper) who found fame after years of frustration as a blocked writer when he discovered an old manuscript in a valise and falls in love with the story, copies it verbatim, has it published, and gains fame and fortune - yet always is concerned that he plagiarized some unknown writer's work. He meets an old man (Jeremy Irons) who gradually reveals that the story is his long lost work - a story about the old man's love affair in France at the end of WW II and the tragedy he suffered that led to the writing of the lost book. As Rory and the old man face the reality of the coincidence life plays tricks and the story returns to the presentation by Clayton Hammond of his prize winning novel that in essence is about the stories we have witnessed. We are left wonder what is fact and what is fiction, and the question is posed as to what have we really have observed.The actors from each section of this tripartite tale offer exemplary performances: Bradley Cooper and Zo Salda&ntilde;a make a credible couple caught up in the frustrations of an early writer's career, Jeremy Irons is solid as are the characters in the life he has described with written words (Ben Barnes and Nora Arnezeder), the various publishing industry people (Zeljko Ivanek, Ron Rifkin), and smaller parts by Liz Stauber, J.K. Simmons, Olivia Wilde and others. This is a story that describes as well as any the machinations, frustrations, inspirations, rewards and mixed realities that accompany the career of a writer.  It is a refreshing food for thought film.

We're 2 book addicts, drama film lovers, and this film's depth is not often seen in big screen theater. It's about sacrificing integrity for fame and money. It details how an unscrupulous decision can implode and create collateral emotional damage to cherished people. The Words is presented in storyline layers, woven together like literature, not easily tracked by those simply looking at action, FX, and adventure. THE WORDS is intellectual with a capital WOW.Hammond (Dennis Quaid) writes a story about an ambitious, but not stellar, young writer Rory (Bradley Cooper) who has ripped-off an unpublished manuscript written by an old man (Jeremy Irons) over 60 years earlier. If you don't understand `plagiarism', stop here and don't bother viewing. It's the entire plot in one word. The story progresses in the same fashion as a bestseller novel, layers woven together, scenes jumping from 2012 to 1940 Paris, and back, from one author (reality) to the next (fictional.) Slow going, NO! Just bookish. After all, the film is about writers--and their significant others. In the end the layers converge, but leave the viewer agape.Rory Jansen's wife, Dora, (Zoe Saldana) is one hot beauty and encouragement to a struggling author. Until... Romantic scenes remain at family viewing level. Also you will love awesome period scenes when the younger life of the old man is told primarily in narration. Actors mostly act, not speak, doing pantomime well. In a novel the words would have been italicized and the visuals would be only thoughts. The Words makes a book come to life before your eyes, like the manuscript did for the author characters in the film.Applauds for the 3 leads, Quaid, Irons, & Cooper; but also Zoe.

1596490,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B009H3LN8Y,J. Richardson,"[3, 3]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Can I gush for a brief moment? I went into The Words expecting to find a movie that was enjoyable, but one that didn't necessarily blow me away. Instead, I was given a film that's so uniquely complex that it's fascinating that it works as well as it does. From the casting to the script to the score, it's one of those movies that hooks you almost instantly and has you sucked in until the credits start rolling.Once again we have another plot that's difficult to summarize without giving the entire thing away. The Words starts with a man by the name of Clayton Hammond (Dennis Quaid) who arrives at a public reading of his new book, ""The Words"". From this point on the film is focused on the story being told as Hammond narrates what's going on. This story follows a young, struggling writer by the name of Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper) who lives in New York with his girlfriend Dora (Zoe Saldana).After his father (J.K. Simmons) informs him that he can't support him forever, Rory gets himself hired at a literary agency in hopes of forming some inside connections. Rory finds himself constantly rejected by publishers as they all tell him that he's written a good novel and that he has a lot of talent, but it's not a book that will sell well from an unknown writer. After a few years have passed Rory and Dora get married and go on their honeymoon in Paris. While in Paris, Dora buys Rory an old briefcase as a gift because she thinks it looks classy.After returning home, Rory finds an old manuscript in the briefcase for a novel that was never published. After reading it he finds himself extremely moved by what he read. So much so that he wishes he had written those words. So in attempt to feel what it would be like to have those words come from his fingers, he types the entire thing up on his computer, but never deletes it. A day or two passes and his wife stumbles across the typed novel on his laptop and, oblivious to the truth, tells him that he needs to get it to someone. Struggling to explain the situation to her due to her enthusiasm, he gets the novel to a publisher and the book winds up getting published a month later. After this happens the rest of the movie has Rory dealing with the repercussions of taking credit for someone else's work.Now what I found so compelling about this story was just how well it was told. The situation moves effortlessly from Rory to Clayton in a way that feels almost surreal. Usually in movies like this you'll get jolted back and forth, but each time we changed from reality to the novel the transition was flawless. The same can be said with the transition into each of the three different stories present in the film. You have Clayton's present, Rory's past/present, and ""The Old Man's"" (Jeremy Irons) past. Each felt like a separate entity, while at the same time feeling like a part of a bigger whole. It's all very interesting the way it was laid out.Cooper's performance in here was great, but one that was a little bumpy at times. Some parts felt a bit awkward, but overall it was a solid performance and one I had little complaints with. Zoe Saldana and Jeremy Irons also gave enjoyable performances as well. Zoe didn't get a lot of screen time, but she delivered a great deal of emotion in every scene she was in. Surprisingly, the weaker links in here, for me, were Quaid and Olivia Wilde. While Quaid didn't give a terrible performance, it wasn't anything noteworthy and I felt Wilde's performance was a little bland. It just lacked energy and her character felt a little out of place.Finally, the score, composed by Marcelo Zarvos, is truly a thing of beauty. Each piece complemented its corresponding scene perfectly and the music did a phenomenal job of heightening the overall experience. I'll even go as far as saying it's one of the best film scores I've heard in years. Now I know there are people out there who will argue about that, but there's just something so moving about it. It's very rare that a film's score compliments its visuals this well, which is what makes this particular score so fantastic.Overall Score: 9/10 - The Words definitely took me by surprise. It's both beautiful and harsh, entertaining and thought provoking. What you take out of the story is dependent on the viewer, but I think they main point is that everyone makes mistakes. You can either let those mistakes ruin your life or you can move on from there and try to right your wrongs.

1596498,A1CYV655X6LBVK,B009H3LN8Y,Kendrick,"[0, 1]","The Words is almost more a parable than a movie. The film has three interlayered stories--Clayton Hammond is an author who writes The Words, a book about Rory Jensen who finds an old book manuscript and decides to publish it as his own, only to be found later by the original author, ""The Old Man"", who has his own tragic story to tell about how he ended up writing the book. Despite this possibly confusing story within a story within a story, The Words is simply about moving on from our mistakes.Hammond's book, though considered fiction, is autobiographical and he supposedly plagiarized the book that first made him famous as a novelist, or at least this is what happened to Rory. Rory and his wife Dora go to France on their honeymoon, where Dora buys her new husband an antique leather bag. Rory is an aspiring writer, but the publishers reject the novel he has been working on for years.It is at this time that Rory stumbles upon the manuscript hidden in the leather bag. He decides to submit the manuscript as his own novel and becomes a successful author. After this seminal work is published, Rory's other novels are also published.Then one day The Old Man finds him and reveals his identity as the original author.  The Old Man also tells Rory how the book was written in the midst of tragedy--his child died as an infant and left his relationship with his wife in ruins. Rory is burdened by guilt and tells his wife and his publisher the truth, leaving his wife feeling betrayed and his publisher in a moral quandary. The publisher convinces Rory to offer to pay The Old Man all the money he made from the book instead of making a public confession of plagiarism, but The Old Man refuses to take the money and tells Rory to move on in life just as he did after his wife left him.The message of the film--whether it is actually wise or even possible to move on from our mistakes--is left unclear. The Old Man doesn't seem to have had a very fulfilling life after the divorce and Rory's narrative does not continue after his encounter with The Old Man. The most decisive explanation may be the closing scene. Hammond is asked what he really wants, and there is a flashback to a scene where Rory asks Dora to forgive him (we are not told if Rory actually ends up moving on without forgiveness, or is forgiven, or lives the rest of his life, like Hammond, with regret).Perhaps this ambiguity in the central message is a directorial move, leaving the first story (Hammond) clearly in favor of the need for forgiveness; the second story (Rory) ambiguous since we don't know the rest of the story since Hammond, the author, leaves it hanging; and the third story, The Old Man, is in favor of moving on and letting go of the past.Although I didn't personally enjoy the film and wouldn't recommend it to friends, the redeemable part of The Words is the exploration of the question of mistakes. The language of ""mistake"" makes it more excusable, as opposed to harsher words such as ""sin,"" having less weightiness and an almost accidental ring that lends itself to empathy. But Hammond recognizes the weightiness and longs for forgiveness. This longing reflects the way we are wired as human beings, looking to find a way to assuage our guilt incurred by our faults.",2,More a parable than a movie,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,3268,"['Words', 'almost', 'more', 'parable', 'movie', 'film', 'three', 'interlayered', 'stories', 'Clayton', 'Hammond', 'author', 'who', 'Words', 'book', 'Rory', 'Jensen', 'who', 'old', 'book', 'manuscript', 'decides', 'publish', 'own', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'later', 'original', 'author', 'Old', 'Man', 'who', 'own', 'tragic', 'story', 'tell', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'writing', 'book', 'possibly', 'confusing', 'story', 'story', 'story', 'Words', 'simply', 'moving', 'mistakes.Hammond', 'book', 'though', 'considered', 'fiction', 'autobiographical', 'supposedly', 'plagiarized', 'book', 'first', 'made', 'famous', 'novelist', 'least', 'happened', 'Rory', 'Rory', 'wife', 'Dora', 'go', 'France', 'honeymoon', 'where', 'Dora', 'new', 'husband', 'antique', 'leather', 'bag', 'Rory', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'publishers', 'reject', 'novel', 'been', 'working', 'years.It', 'time', 'Rory', 'manuscript', 'hidden', 'leather', 'bag', 'submit', 'manuscript', 'own', 'novel', 'successful', 'author', 'seminal', 'work', 'published', 'Rory', 'other', 'novels', 'are', 'also', 'published.Then', 'one', 'day', 'Old', 'Man', 'reveals', 'identity', 'original', 'author', 'Old', 'Man', 'also', 'Rory', 'how', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'midst', 'tragedy', 'child', 'died', 'infant', 'left', 'relationship', 'wife', 'ruins', 'Rory', 'burdened', 'guilt', 'wife', 'publisher', 'truth', 'leaving', 'wife', 'feeling', 'betrayed', 'publisher', 'moral', 'quandary', 'publisher', 'Rory', 'offer', 'pay', 'Old', 'Man', 'money', 'made', 'book', 'instead', 'making', 'public', 'confession', 'plagiarism', 'Old', 'Man', 'take', 'money', 'Rory', 'move', 'life', 'just', 'did', 'wife', 'left', 'him.The', 'message', 'film', 'actually', 'wise', 'even', 'possible', 'move', 'mistakes', 'left', 'unclear', 'Old', 'Man', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'fulfilling', 'life', 'divorce', 'Rory', 'narrative', 'not', 'continue', 'encounter', 'Old', 'Man', 'most', 'decisive', 'explanation', 'may', 'be', 'closing', 'scene', 'Hammond', 'asked', 'what', 'really', 'flashback', 'scene', 'where', 'Rory', 'Dora', 'forgive', 'are', 'not', 'told', 'Rory', 'actually', 'up', 'moving', 'forgiveness', 'forgiven', 'rest', 'life', 'Hammond', 'regret', 'ambiguity', 'central', 'message', 'directorial', 'move', 'leaving', 'first', 'story', 'Hammond', 'clearly', 'favor', 'need', 'forgiveness', 'second', 'story', 'Rory', 'ambiguous', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'rest', 'story', 'Hammond', 'author', 'hanging', 'third', 'story', 'Old', 'Man', 'favor', 'moving', 'letting', 'go', 'past.Although', 'did', ""n't"", 'personally', 'enjoy', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'friends', 'redeemable', 'part', 'Words', 'exploration', 'question', 'mistakes', 'language', 'mistake', 'more', 'excusable', 'opposed', 'harsher', 'words', 'such', 'sin', 'having', 'less', 'weightiness', 'almost', 'accidental', 'ring', 'empathy', 'Hammond', 'weightiness', 'longs', 'forgiveness', 'longing', 'way', 'are', 'wired', 'human', 'beings', 'looking', 'find', 'way', 'assuage', 'guilt', 'incurred', 'faults']",N/A

The book is about a guy named Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper) who wants to be a writer.  Clay reads and the story about Rory Jansen unfolds....Rory has spent the last 3 years writing a book. He submits his manuscript to many publishers but only receives rejection letters.  He is very discouraged and needs money.  So Rory takes a job at a publishing house to pay the bills while he continues to write.  With a steady income now in place, Rory and his girlfriend Dora get married and go to Paris on their honeymoon. While shopping, Dora buys a used briefcase for Rory as a gift.  Later on, Rory opens the briefcase and finds a manuscript inside.  The loose pages appear old and are typed from a typewriter. He reads the manuscript and realizes the writing is much better than his own.  Rory types the words into his laptop computer.  Dora finds it and urges him to show it to someone at the publishing house where he works.  Rory does and it becomes a best seller.  Then one day, Rory is sitting in the park reading when an old man (Jeremy Irons) sits on the bench next to him.  The old man starts talking to Rory and he realizes the manuscript he found was written by this old man. Rory regrets taking credit for the story and wants to make it right.  He asks his publisher to remove his name from the book.  The publisher says no and tells Rory to just pay the old man for the story.  Rory tries to pay him but the old man refuses his money. The old man dies.  Rory still feels bad about taking credit for the work so he takes the original manuscript to the old man's grave site and drops it on top of the casket.Olivia Wilde plays the part of a fan who is infatuated with the writer Clay Hammond.In the end, it appears Clay Hammond may be Rory Jansen.",5,Writers can identify with this movie,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,1883,"['Clay', 'Hammond', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'writer', 'movie', 'Clay', 'auditorium', 'reading', 'book', 'called', 'Words', 'audience', 'book', 'guy', 'named', 'Rory', 'Jansen', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'who', 'be', 'writer', 'Clay', 'story', 'Rory', 'Jansen', 'unfolds', '.Rory', 'spent', 'last', '3', 'years', 'writing', 'book', 'manuscript', 'many', 'publishers', 'only', 'rejection', 'letters', 'very', 'discouraged', 'money', 'So', 'Rory', 'job', 'publishing', 'house', 'pay', 'bills', 'write', 'steady', 'income', 'now', 'place', 'Rory', 'girlfriend', 'Dora', 'get', 'married', 'go', 'Paris', 'honeymoon', 'shopping', 'Dora', 'used', 'briefcase', 'Rory', 'gift', 'Later', 'Rory', 'briefcase', 'manuscript', 'inside', 'loose', 'pages', 'appear', 'old', 'are', 'typed', 'typewriter', 'manuscript', 'writing', 'much', 'better', 'own', 'Rory', 'words', 'laptop', 'computer', 'Dora', 'show', 'someone', 'publishing', 'house', 'where', 'Rory', 'best', 'seller', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'Rory', 'sitting', 'park', 'reading', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'bench', 'next', 'old', 'man', 'talking', 'Rory', 'manuscript', 'found', 'was', 'written', 'old', 'man', 'Rory', 'regrets', 'taking', 'credit', 'story', 'make', 'right', 'publisher', 'remove', 'name', 'book', 'publisher', 'Rory', 'just', 'pay', 'old', 'man', 'story', 'Rory', 'tries', 'pay', 'old', 'man', 'money', 'old', 'man', 'Rory', 'still', 'bad', 'taking', 'credit', 'work', 'so', 'original', 'manuscript', 'old', 'man', 'grave', 'site', 'top', 'casket.Olivia', 'Wilde', 'part', 'fan', 'who', 'infatuated', 'writer', 'Clay', 'Hammond.In', 'end', 'Clay', 'Hammond', 'may', 'be', 'Rory', 'Jansen']",N/A

Everyone who reads it acknowledges it as a masterpiece. It enables him to get his other works published and he gets all the acclaim he ever wanted. Only thing is the story is not his and soon the real writer appears played by Jeremy Irons who gives one of the best acting performances I have seen all year.A parallel story emerges with Dennis Quaid playing a writer telling the story played by Bradley Cooper which raises the question of whether it's truth or fiction and then we have the Jeremy Irons story within a story set near the end of WW2 in France and the events on which the book is based.If there is one thing I learned from this movie the number one reason to write a reason a book is not for acclaim or money or personal satisfaction, but book groupies in this case amply played by Olivia Wilde.How much of what a writer writes is imagination and how much personal experience?The Words poses that question and the answer is worth wondering about and I think the movie is well worth experiencing.If the story has one weakness I think the resolve is too easy, there's no real test of conscience or dark side.I think most people will find it thought provoking at least and as most people think about writing a book at some point, you may find some resonance with it as I did.

But every now and then a movie comes along that makes you think, makes you care and makes you wonder what if.THE WORDS is a story within a story within a story. That may sound complicated at first but as it unfolds you find it's not really. Dennis Quaid stars as Clay Hammond, an author at a reading for his biggest best seller. With audience in rapt attention, Hammond begins to tell his story.The story revolves around Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper), a struggling author who is deeply in love with the girl of his dreams Dora (Zo Saldana).  In New York struggling to get by things are tough but they manage living on love as much as their meager incomes. Unable to find a publisher for his novel, Rory takes a job at a publishing house to help make ends meet. Eventually he and Dora marry and spend their honeymoon in Paris, the home of great authors of the past.While in Paris Rory comes across an old briefcase in a used goods store he admires and Dora buys it for him. When they return home he looks at it closer to find a story inside unlike any he's ever read. This is great writing. Unable to anchor his own thoughts to paper, Rory rewrites the piece he found on his laptop. When Dora reads this story, she's brought to tears and encourages him to submit it to a publisher. Rory's initial predicament is then should he do it or not? It's not his story even though he's change it to his style of writing. Is this the ethical thing to do?He does submit the story and of course it becomes a major best seller. Rory receives accolades for the tale he's told. And then one day and old man (Jeremy Irons) follows him to the park and reveals to him that the story was his, written when he was much younger and in Paris. He then reveals the story behind the story to Rory, telling him how it came to be written and why. Wanting nothing in return he simply lets Rory know that for him it was about telling him how it came to be.The question then becomes deeper for Rory. Should he let the world know that this man was responsible for the tale and in so doing ruin his career and possibly his marriage? Or should he continue on as if nothing every happened?At the same time there is the story of Clay. Tempted by a young writing student named Daniella (Olivia Wilde), she wants to know what happens at the end of the story. Clay left it for those at the reading to discover when they bought the book. She has a desire to find out now and as they discuss it the thought runs through both her mind and the viewers, could Clay actually be Rory?Very well made and plotted so that the pace of the film slowly reveals the answers to most of these questions makes this a movie worth watching. The sense of time and place are well thought out and on display here. The acting by all those involved is wonderful to see with subtle tugs here and there that make these characters believable. In lesser hands this would have been just a tear jerking melodrama with no heart. From the writing to the acting it is instead a movie that makes you feel for the characters.Perhaps the biggest question that is dealt in this film is one that is offered during the extras on the DVD. That question is what would you do if God gave you the desire and passion to do something but you realized you didn't have the talent? I don't think there is anyone who's never questioned themselves with that one only to find they had no clear cut answer. Neither does Rory or Clay. But in watching this film you walk away wondering once more and feeling for each and every character, especially Rory. I couldn't stop thinking when it was over, what would a man with a clear cut conscience do if he felt himself forced to perform an unconscionable thing to achieve his dreams?

The thing I don't get is, no real writer would ever steal a story. We're really not in it for the fame--we're in it for the story, for the actual writing. I can love and appreciate a story and wish that I had written it, but I could never pass one off as my own, because the passion for writing is about the writing itself, not about the fame and fortune that might come. Secondly, we all know that fame and fortune doesn't come to most writers anyway. Certainly not as quickly and the way it did for this writer in the movie.That said, there were some intricate scenes, stories within stories, that were peeled away in layers, built up to a crescendo, then slowly wrapped back up. The interior stories were solid. The ending, while it leaves something to be desired, I don't know if I can say what it leaves desired without spoilers, and I hate to provide spoilers.I think watching this movie is sort of like the difference between reading literary fiction or genre fiction--some people love both, some love one or the other. This story is more 'literary' than genre. It's not a love story, but it has several love stories in it. It's not a thriller or suspense, but it has some suspenseful moments. It's not drama, but it is dramatic.The acting was excellent. The story was compelling. The stories inside the stories were compelling. The only two things that really get me are the ending (which was really weak) and the suspension of disbelief that this would be a likely scenario, because, like I said, writers rarely steal, debut novels rarely break out this big and win awards that quickly, and the unlikelihood of the old man reading a random book, AND living in the same place as the author, AND just stumbling upon him. AND.... no, failed me a bit. But for the sake of entertainment, I could ignore all that, and like I said, the acting is good.I don't feel like it was a waste of money to rent it and watch it. It's a good date-night or solo movie, not really a family movie, but definitely worth watching, I think.As a writer, I will say, one part rings true... the support of his father during the writing process, well, that's something I think many writers dream of having, and being told that maybe his writing should be a hobby.

But lots of people seem to have enjoyed The Words, and I can't see why, and I can't let it go at that. It was a somewhat watchable movie, largely due to its stellar cast list (and its relative brevity), but in the end it struck me - my opinion - as sloppily written, predictable, and poorly directed. Indeed, directors Klugman and Sternthal are a double threat, having also been the writers, and thus perpetrators of some of the most clunky, banal dialogue ever to make it to the silver screen. As directors, they've succeeded in eliciting what must be career-worst performances from Dennis Quaid and Jeremy Irons as well as a thoroughly bewildering performance from Olivia Wilde. Not even talented, handsome Bradley Cooper convinces as the man smitten by ""words,"" or projects an authorial intelligence, or ever seems for a single minute to be credible as someone driven to write. Okay, it was a low-budget ""friends"" project: Cooper and Klugman/Sternthal have been buds forever, and perhaps the 25-day shoot explains some of the mailed-in - or in Wilde's case, incoherent - performances.I watched in grim fascination, albeit unmoved and unengaged by the uncompelling acting and a story that calls most of its shots and, in the end, was delighted it was all over. Still, I could not help but wonder: Could Cooper have actually seen something in the story his pals wrote that didn't make it to the screen? How did they get Jerermy Irons for this? And why are English actors so often cast as Americans? Very unlike Irons to be merely punching a clock, but he was utterly perfunctory, abetted by abysmal old-age makeup: and did no one on the set notice that he was slipping from his regionally indistinguishable ""American"" into stretches of Britspeak? What could Quaid have been thinking in an important scene with Olivia Wilde in his chic New York author's apartment that resulted in his very odd, disturbing, dyspeptic facial expressions? As for the baffling Olivia Wilde turn as the hot graduate student cum Dennis Quaid groupie - I think this may be a little spoiler - she's framed and shot (and directed, I have to suppose) as some kind of psychotic creep and author stalker. I kept waiting for her to pop up out of Quaid's bathtub brandishing a chef's knife, but there's nothing of the psycho in her role. She's just an admiring graduate student. Was this a Klugman/Sternthal McGuffin? More likely, it was either a thread that never really got picked up - the Wilde character WAS supposed to be menacing, but we never got to the menacing punchline - or just another piece of a botched directorial debut.For what it's worth, Zoe Saldana gives a nice account of herself, bringing this almost wholly inert picture to life in her scenes. And the ubiquitous sympathetic father-player, J.K. Simmons, did well with some of the worst lines ever foisted upon a hard-working character actor. He and the cast had to deliver those lines over a blaring, grandiose soundtrack, almost a Bernard Hermann caricature, that seemed to swell obtrusively whenever something quieter was called for.

1596569,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B009H3LN8Y,Stanley Crowe,"[1, 1]","We're to imagine a famous author, Clayton Hammond (Dennis Quaid), giving a public reading of his novel ""The Words.""  As he talks, we see enacted the scenes he's reading -- scenes from the life of a young writer called Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper), who, after failing to get several manuscripts published, succeeds with a manuscript that he didn't write but passed off to an agent as his own work.  In fact, he had found the manuscript in an old briefcase that his wife (Zoe Saldana) had bought for him in a second-hand shop in Paris.  His wife doesn't know about the manuscript, so when it gets published, she, like the agent, thinks that it's Rory's own work.  The book wins awards, and Rory becomes rich and famous.  As this story is unfolding, we see some scenes and we hear Clayton's voice connecting them -- so we never lose sight of the fact that what we're seeing is what's being read in public by Clayton.There comes a point in Clayton's story when an old man (Jeremy Irons) tells Rory that he wrote the manuscript half-a-century earlier in Paris, after the death of his child, and that he lost it when his wife inadvertently left it on a train.  THIS story, told to Rory alone as he and the old man sit on a bench in Central Park, is in turn dramatized -- we see scenes of Paris after the war and the young version of the old man (Ben Barnes) suffering the losses he describes and writing his manuscript while his wife, distraught after the death of the child, is at her parents' home in another city.  He sends the completed manuscript to her, and it is as she returns to Paris that she leaves it on the train.  SO -- there's Clayton's overarching story, partly dramatized, which includes within it a story, in its turn partially dramatized too.  It's a strength of the movie that we are never confused by the box-within-a-box quality of the narrative -- it is splendidly clear.Also crucial to the movie's success is Jeremy Irons's performance as the old man -- we see a lot of him sitting on that bench telling the story (more than we see of Dennis Quaid in the public reading), and he narrates grippingly.  The lovely voice is captivating, and it captivates Rory as well as us.  So much so, in fact, that Rory is ready to 'fess up publicly and ruin himself in the process.  He admits the truth to his wife and to his agent/publisher, both of whom are against revelation, though, obviously, Rory's relations with both are damaged by his confessions.  He finds the old man again and tells him of his intention to go public with the truth -- and, to his surprise, the old man advises strongly against it and seeks nothing from Rory.  It's not exactly a moment of forgiveness, but it's resembles one, though the old man makes clear that he wants Rory to live with a pain comparable to his own.  The old man tells Rory that his anger over the lost manuscript destroyed his relationship with his wife, which, he soon realized, should have meant more to him than the story, but, as he says, ""I loved my words more than my life"" (not an exact quotation).  The old man feels HE did wrong and has lived with a bad choice he made -- he counsels Rory to keep his mouth shut and do the same.  Rory too, of course, chose words over truth and honesty in relationships, and we're meant to see the moral kinship of the two.  Rory's conversations with the old man are ""talky,"" but they're the dramatic heart of the movie.And Clayton Hammond? Clearly he's the older Rory, revealing in a novel the truth about this earlier part of his life.  Dennis Quaid suggests very effectively the uncomfortableness of the man, from his very first words to his public audience (""'The Words' [pause] . . by me."") and by every gesture and conversation thereafter.  When a sexy writing student (Olivia Wilde), perhaps guessing an autobiographical element in Clayton's novel, throws herself at him, he is tempted, but rejects her.  He is now separated from his wife but still wearing his wedding ring.  Like the old man, his enchantment by the words of the story led to choices that undermined a relationship he valued.  Is Clayton, as they say, ""able to look at himself in the mirror""? He does so, obviously, at the end, and he doesn't much like what he sees, but like the old man, he's just getting on with it.Problems?  The structure isn't all that dramatic, for all the vividness of some of the recalled scenes, but to the credit of Quaid and Irons, they make out of that structure something more dramatic and engaging than one might have thought possible.  I would just add that the women's parts aren't all that interesting.  Wilde as the sexy student who wants to sleep with the distinguished older writer is a bit of a stereotype as written.  Wilde's performance is fine, though.  The other two women are more symbols of what their men have lost than they are very developed characters.  Their beauty makes the point: Zoe Saldana as Rory's wife is a very good-looking woman, and Nora Arnezeder as the wife of the young version of the old man has something of the emotional transparency of Kate Winslet.  We get the point about loss, but there's not much to them as written.  That's no criticism at all of either actress.To sum up -- I found the movie engaging and, especially in the relation between Irons's and Cooper's characters, touching.  There's also something attractively grown-up about the idea of living with a consciousness of one's imperfections and their costs.",4,"ingeniously structured and engaging, if somewhat

My attempts and research have gained me a few precious insights.The greatest insight being that the role of the subconscious is so powerful in the artistic process that writing at it's best is as if someone else, a spirit force, perhaps, is speaking through you. And it feels like it is not even you who is writing. It is like it is being dictated to you.

What if, while working toward that goal, you found a shortcut? Would you take it?A renowned author by the name of Clayton Hammond (played by Dennis Quaid) is reading excerpts from his new novel to a crowd of anxious admirers. The title of that novel is The Words and the protagonist is also a writer. The writer in Hammond's novel is Rory Jansen (played by Bradley Cooper) and while he earns his living at a literary agency, his official title is mail supervisor. He's submitted numerous works to various agents and publishers, but with no success. Still, Dora (his live-in girlfriend played by Zoe Saldana) tells him not to lose hope. Time passes; Rory and Dora marry, and honeymoon in Paris. France, not Texas, in case you weren't sure. While shopping, Dora comes across a leather briefcase in an antique store and buys it for Rory. With the honeymoon over, the couple returns home to the same trials and tribulations. While examining the briefcase Dora gave him, Rory finds a manuscript inside. It's old; that much is obvious from the paper and the fact that it was typed on an old-fashioned typewriter. What Rory finds when he examines it further, is that it is a beautiful story written by someone whose talent far outweighs his own. Shocked by this and still disheartened by his own prospects, or lack thereof, he decides to type the entire novel on his own laptop just to feel the flow of the story in his fingers. From there things get even more complicated.Now, there's a good deal more to The Words than what I've just told you. Hammond, Dennis Quaid's character, has suffered a personal setback that I didn't get to mention, there's the origin of the manuscript found by Cooper's character, what happens once he's entered the entire tome into his laptop. Still, I didn't enjoy it. I can appreciate films about writers, even stories within stories, but there are no truly sympathetic characters in The Words.
