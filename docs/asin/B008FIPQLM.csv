It is a very complex plot, but both fun to follow along with and very thoughtful and witty.  I have never had to think through a movie of this genre in the way I had to watching this one. It was very well done and you don't just sit following battles, you follow the strategies and get insight on the thoughts of how leaders never felt secure through this time in history.  Yes, expect to sit and watch closely if you want to follow the plot as it is complex.

1551826,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B008FIPQLM,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[12, 12]","A beautiful, violent Chinese historical film that features a loose adaptation of ""The Feast at Hong Gate"" written and directed by Daniel Lee (""14 Blades"", ""Three Kingdoms: Resurrection oft he Dragon"", ""Black Mask"")  and featuring an all-star cast with Leon Lai (""Fallen Angels"", ""Seven Swords"", ""Comrades: Almost a Love Story""), Feng Shaofeng, Liu Yifei (""Forbidden Kingdom""), Zhang Hanyu, Anthony Wong (""Infernal Affairs"" films, ""Exiled"", ""Hard Boiled""), Jordan Chan (""Help!!!"", ""Skyline Cruisers"", ""Spy Dad""), Andy On, Xiu Qing and Jia Qing.The film was nominated for four Hong Kong Film Awards including ""Best Art Direction"" and ""Best Costume & Make Up Design"" and was released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Well Go USA.""White Vengance"" is a film that is loosely based on the Feast at Hong Gate and the fall of the Qin Dynasty.VIDEO:""White Vengeance"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (16:9 Widescreen).  The film looks absolutely beautiful in HD.  The use of CG to make a war look like thousands were taking part in the battle looked effective.  The detail on closeups were amazing but it's the detail that comes with the costume and make-up including production design that is the winner of this film.  Everything looks impressive, even the makeup, I would not have known that legendary HK star Leon Lai was playing the part of Liu Bang, until I read the front cover of the Blu-ray.  But from a cool to warm presentation in HD, the film looks great, with some areas looking a bit soft at times.  But considering that the film is primarily focused on close-ups and wide-angles, the film looks great, black levels are nice and deep and well-contrast.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""White Vengeance"" is presented in Mandarin DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  As one can expect from a film with a lot of action, there are good use of directional sound effects coming from the surround channels.  From spears and arrows being shot from one side to the other, the sound of horses galloping on the battlefield to the sounds of the clanging swords.  The lossless soundtrack for ""White Vengeance"" features awesome dynamic range, crystal clear dialogue and also wonderful use of the surround for the music!Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES""White Vengeance"" comes with the following special features:Behind the Scenes - (54:27) Behind-the-scenes of the rehearsals for the action sequences and the making of the film.Cast and Crew Interviews - (36:03) Featuring cast and crew interviews.Trailer - (1:40) The original theatrical trailer for ""White Vengeance"".International Trailer - (1:06) The international trailer for ""White Vengeance"".EXTRAS:""White Vengeance"" comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:""White Vengeance"" is a beautiful film and possibly the best film so far from writer/director Danny Lee.  From the look of the film thanks to its beautiful cinematography, wonderful costume design and make-up and also the effective and believable production design, the film looks and sounds quite impressive on Blu-ray!But with so many Chinese historical films, how does ""White Vengeance"" compare to other epic films?  For one, it's an interesting take on the ""Feast at Hong Gate"" and the battle between Xiang Yu and Liu Bang.  Two leaders, two sworn brothers in battle but yet, two of the most powerful men of insurgent groups, it was destined that these two would become rivals and enemies.  As both men wanted to become Lord Qin.There approach to competing for this title is what is fascinating.  Xiang Yu is a warrior, while Liu Bang is the pacifist who wants no one to die, but he knows that to protect the people, he must become the leader by doing things he may not want to do.  This includes going against the man who one called him brother, Xiang Yu.While many fans of this of Asian cinema will come to expect the fighting on the battlefield, the amount of corruption between warring factions but the film's strength lies in its portrayal of strategy.Xiang Yu's use of the legendary strategist Fan Zeng and Liu Bang's use of the #2 strategist Zhang Liang.  Both men are wonderful advisers, but as much as the film is a battle between both Xiang Yu and Liu Beng, it's also a battle between two master strategists, Fan Zheng and Zhang Liang.And it's the strategic ways of how each counter each other that to me, was the most captivating part of the storyline.  Both leaders depend on their advisers/strategists and it adds to the storyline of loyalty and betrayal.  Does one's thirst for power exceed the trust one has in their close advisor's and the people close to them?  You'll have to see how things play out between this war between two leaders.Once again, this film is loosely based on the actual story of Xiang Yu and Liu Beng.  For one, the actual relatonship between Xiang Yu and Yu Ji has been romanticized quite a bit for this film, but it in it's overall effectiveness of trying to include a romantic aspect to the film, it does work for ""White Vengeance"".There were other characters that tried to showcase the loyalty of the men of Xiang Yu and Liu Beng.  In one scene, during the ""Feast at Hong Gate"", we see Fan Kuai (portrayed by Jordan Chan) biting off his finger as a sign of his loyalty to Liu Bang.  Also, characters did not live or die as was seen in the film, although the depiction of loyalty to their leader during a certain time seems to be factual.But for those looking for a film for historical accuracy, many directors pursue a loose adaptation in order to make the movie more appealing to audiences.  So, for those expecting an exact depiction of what took place during this era in Chinese history, you're not going to get an authentic adaptation.As for the Blu-ray release, ""White Vengeance"" looks and sounds amazing.  The cinematography, costume and set design, make-up are well-done and the use of the lossless soundtrack to capture the sounds of war was amazingly done.  And you also get a few special features as well.Overall, ""White Vengeance"" is a good Chinese historical film but definitely not one of the best.  While the action and the use of strategy was fascinating, the storyline is a bit difficult to showcase something so complex when it focuses on four individuals.  Yes, the film's primary characters are Xiang Yu and Liu Bang, but by the second half, the story then switches to Zhang Liang and Fan Zeng, the strategist a bit more and all of a sudden, we see this change between both primary characters that leave you feeling as if you missed a bit of character development after what had taken place at the ""Feast at Hong Gate"".But other than that, I did enjoy ""White Vengeance"" but compared to other Chinese historical films or war epics, ""White Vengeance"" featured wonderful costume and set design, but for its story,  it was good...just not great.  And because of it's complexity of the timeline and focus on various characters, I found myself having to rewind and rewatch certain scenes because I was getting confused.  But for those who love Chinese historical films with plenty of action, you'll more than likely enjoy ""White Vengeance""!",4,"(3.5 stars) A beautiful film, a complex film and unfortunately, confusing

1551830,A1WTP99BOA0PGA,B008FIPQLM,"J. Mullally ""booklover4ever00""","[3, 3]","This movie has the look and feel of Three Kingdoms, moody and dark, not the wit and verve of Red Cliff, so many viewers might be disappointed if they are expecting the latter. Having said that, we get outstanding performances from Leon Lai and Anthony Wong.The three kingdoms fought each other so extensively that a new dynasty, the Qin (Chin, as in China) have taken over, but their power at this stage is by no means assured. We have repression on the one side and a vision of freedom on the other. But is it really practical, or will men be men and obey their own wills, regardless of what god wants. That is the question posed in the main 'banquet' scene and resonates throughout the rest of the film.The fight scenes, when we get them, are excellent, and the rest of the extensive supporting cast is like a who's who of Chinese cinema in the past 20 years if you can wrack your brain to recognize all of them.Unfortunately, you will be wracking your brain for a lot of other reasons in this movie, so will not have the time. The Chinese game of 'Go' or weiqi features heavily in this film, enough to make your head spin. The catalogue of 'betrayals' does as well. I put that word in quotes because it is a case of guessing who did what to whom and why, or they did not really do it, but the person believed that they did.  My final issue for not giving this 5 stars is that we don't get to see enough of each 'hero' in action at the start of the movie to be able to take sides all that easily, so at the end we just get a sense of waste and futility, so why did we spend over 2 hours watching the movie. The CGI ranges from great to clunky and the costumes and sets have all been seen before, but that makes a movie which could seem really 'foreign' look like an old friend. I enjoyed it, but I had to admit I needed to watch it through twice with stops and starts several times to make sure I did not miss anything in terms of subtitles or nuances between characters.",4,"Sequel to Three Kingdoms, not Red Cliff, so be warned",1377820800,"08 30, 2013",2013,1973,"['movie', 'look', 'feel', 'Three', 'Kingdoms', 'moody', 'dark', 'not', 'wit', 'verve', 'Red', 'Cliff', 'so', 'many', 'viewers', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'expecting', 'latter', 'Having', 'said', 'get', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Leon', 'Lai', 'Anthony', 'Wong.The', 'three', 'kingdoms', 'fought', 'other', 'so', 'extensively', 'new', 'dynasty', 'Qin', 'Chin', 'China', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'power', 'stage', 'means', 'assured', 'have', 'repression', 'one', 'side', 'vision', 'freedom', 'other', 'really', 'practical', 'will', 'men', 'be', 'men', 'obey', 'own', 'wills', 'regardless', 'what', 'god', 'question', 'posed', 'main', ""'banquet"", 'scene', 'rest', 'film.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'when', 'get', 'are', 'excellent', 'rest', 'extensive', 'supporting', 'cast', 'who', 'who', 'Chinese', 'cinema', 'past', '20', 'years', 'can', 'wrack', 'brain', 'recognize', 'them.Unfortunately', 'will', 'be', 'wracking', 'brain', 'lot', 'other', 'reasons', 'movie', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'Chinese', 'game', ""'Go"", 'weiqi', 'features', 'heavily', 'film', 'enough', 'make', 'head', 'spin', 'catalogue', ""'betrayals"", 'as', 'well', 'put', 'word', 'quotes', 'case', 'guessing', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'whom', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'do', 'person', 'believed', 'did', 'My', 'final', 'issue', 'not', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'enough', ""'hero"", 'action', 'start', 'movie', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'sides', 'easily', 'so', 'end', 'just', 'get', 'sense', 'waste', 'futility', 'so', 'why', 'did', 'spend', '2', 'hours', 'watching', 'movie', 'CGI', 'great', 'clunky', 'costumes', 'sets', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'movie', 'could', 'seem', 'really', ""'foreign"", 'look', 'old', 'friend', 'enjoyed', 'had', 'admit', 'needed', 'watch', 'twice', 'stops', 'several', 'times', 'make', 'sure', 'did', 'not', 'miss', 'anything', 'terms', 'subtitles', 'nuances', 'characters']",N/A

I've watched quite a few Chinese, historical, drama movies and I have to say this one was the most confusing to understand with all the different plots and characters. There seemed to be no initial character or story development which was the reason that made the characters confusing to tell apart and their different motives difficult to decipher.  The movie was also way too long and should have been edited down to a shorter time frame. The sword fights and battle scenes were probably the best part of the movie but even those seemed somehow uninspired, as though we'd seen it all before only done better elsewhere. It's a story filled with back stabbing, politics, intrigue and a melodramatic romance thrown in for good measure but it left this viewer watching the clock to see how much longer it would run. I'd probably have to view it again to get it all straight in my mind but could I sit through it another time??? Perhaps doubtful!!!

It turns out to be exactly what I fear: another smaltzy melodrama with all of historical inaccuracies. The plot is pretentious and acting is self conscious. Can Chinese movie makers in general or screenwriters in particular try to learn a thing or two from some of Hollywood's better historical eipcs such as Elizabeth or even lesser movies such as Brave Heart. We as the audience can tolerate certain historical inaccuracies for dramatic impacts. But this movie probably has 15 % history and 85 % padding of melodrama. But on the other hand, you might enjoy it if you are not familiarized with the history of Chu-Han struggles. It is just a passable kung-fu movie with corny dialogues and over the top, but unnatural acting.",2,White Vengeance,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,868,"['had', 'huge', 'expectations', 'watching', 'film', 'hoping', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'kung-fu', 'movie', 'distorted', 'historical', 'twists', 'out', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'fear', 'smaltzy', 'melodrama', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'plot', 'pretentious', 'acting', 'self', 'conscious', 'Can', 'Chinese', 'movie', 'makers', 'general', 'screenwriters', 'particular', 'try', 'learn', 'thing', 'two', 'Hollywood', 'better', 'historical', 'eipcs', 'such', 'Elizabeth', 'even', 'lesser', 'movies', 'such', 'Brave', 'Heart', 'audience', 'can', 'tolerate', 'certain', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'dramatic', 'impacts', 'movie', 'probably', '15', '%', 'history', '85', '%', 'padding', 'melodrama', 'other', 'hand', 'might', 'enjoy', 'are', 'not', 'familiarized', 'history', 'Chu-Han', 'struggles', 'just', 'passable', 'kung-fu', 'movie', 'corny', 'dialogues', 'top', 'unnatural', 'acting']",N/A
1551837,A557559XPTL6D,B008FIPQLM,Stephen O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","White Vengeance is a sprawling wuxia epic taking place over a period of several years, focusing on two warriors who were allies during rebellion against what was perceived as an unjust rulership, and slowly turn into rivals as they rise to power.  What could have been just a straight-forward but effective tale of mounting personal ambitions becomes something else.  Neither of the two, Xiang Yu (played by Shaofeng Feng) or  Liu Bang (played by Leon Lai), seems as much motivated by a drive for their own glory and power as by a belief that the other, should he become the ruler of the Qin Dynasty, will be a tyrant.  They're played against each other by their former ally, the ruler of the neighboring Chu kingdom, and they're also divided by their mutual love for the same woman.  As the movie goes on, each starts to become the ruthless lord they think of the other as, which just convinces their opponent of how much he has to put a stop to his rival.  Thus becoming more ruthless himself, and continuing the tightening of the cycle.  And on it goes, and the viewer will likely find their sympathies shifting back and forth from one side to the other as the movie goes on.  Overall though, the movie has the tone of a great tragedy: neither man is evil, they both set out well-intentioned, but in their desire to prevent the other's rise to tyranny they're each rising to that tyranny himself.  And perhaps the biggest question as the movie goes on is: are either of them going to be able to see the path they're both on before it's too late?The action is great, although it doesn't occupy quite as much screen time as in some of the other Asian epics.  Time is made to go into the dramatic angles in-depth and the 'human game of chess' angles in-depth.  The romantic angle also gets a bit more screen time than usual (like it did in the outstandingHouse of Flying Daggers).  Some fans feel, with White Vengeance in particular, that this detracts from and 'slows down' the movie.  I'm not one of them; I liked the way the love story fit into the overall picture.  And visually - even by the cinematically gorgeous standards of many of the recent Asian epics, this really stands out as being among the leaders of the pack.  The cinematography, the attention to detail in creating the whole look of the ancient China from the buildings to the weaponry to the looks of the characters, and the majesty of the lands where the story takes place, all make for a hugely memorable visual experience to compliment the dramatic experience.  If you've enjoyed movies likeRed Cliff International Version - Part I & Part II,Battle of the Warriors (Special Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] and the aforementionedHouse of Flying DaggersI think you'll love this one too.",5,Epic - And Sometimes Tragic - Chinese Historical Action-Drama,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,2757,"['White', 'Vengeance', 'sprawling', 'wuxia', 'epic', 'taking', 'place', 'period', 'several', 'years', 'focusing', 'two', 'warriors', 'who', 'were', 'allies', 'rebellion', 'what', 'was', 'perceived', 'unjust', 'rulership', 'slowly', 'turn', 'rivals', 'rise', 'power', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'straight-forward', 'effective', 'tale', 'mounting', 'personal', 'ambitions', 'something', 'else', 'two', 'Xiang', 'Yu', 'played', 'Shaofeng', 'Feng', 'Liu', 'Bang', 'played', 'Leon', 'Lai', 'as', 'much', 'motivated', 'drive', 'own', 'glory', 'power', 'belief', 'other', 'should', 'become', 'ruler', 'Qin', 'Dynasty', 'will', 'be', 'tyrant', ""'re"", 'played', 'other', 'former', 'ally', 'ruler', 'neighboring', 'Chu', 'kingdom', ""'re"", 'also', 'divided', 'mutual', 'love', 'same', 'woman', 'movie', 'become', 'ruthless', 'lord', 'think', 'other', 'just', 'opponent', 'how', 'much', 'put', 'stop', 'rival', 'Thus', 'becoming', 'more', 'ruthless', 'continuing', 'tightening', 'cycle', 'viewer', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'sympathies', 'shifting', 'back', 'forth', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'movie', 'Overall', 'movie', 'tone', 'great', 'tragedy', 'man', 'evil', 'set', 'out', 'well-intentioned', 'desire', 'prevent', 'other', 'rise', 'tyranny', ""'re"", 'rising', 'tyranny', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'question', 'movie', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'path', ""'re"", 'too', 'late', 'action', 'great', ""n't"", 'occupy', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'other', 'Asian', 'epics', 'Time', 'made', 'go', 'dramatic', 'angles', 'in-depth', ""'human"", 'game', 'chess', 'angles', 'in-depth', 'romantic', 'angle', 'also', 'bit', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'usual', 'did', 'outstandingHouse', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'fans', 'feel', 'White', 'Vengeance', 'particular', 'down', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'liked', 'way', 'love', 'story', 'fit', 'overall', 'picture', 'visually', 'even', 'cinematically', 'gorgeous', 'standards', 'many', 'recent', 'Asian', 'epics', 'really', 'out', 'being', 'leaders', 'pack', 'cinematography', 'attention', 'detail', 'creating', 'whole', 'look', 'ancient', 'China', 'buildings', 'weaponry', 'looks', 'characters', 'majesty', 'lands', 'where', 'story', 'place', 'make', 'hugely', 'memorable', 'visual', 'experience', 'compliment', 'dramatic', 'experience', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'likeRed', 'Cliff', 'International', 'Version', 'Part', 'Part', 'II', 'Battle', 'Warriors', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'aforementionedHouse', 'Flying', 'DaggersI', 'think', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one', 'too']",N/A
