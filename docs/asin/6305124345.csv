449938,A395XF8C86QGAR,6305124345,Jonathan Smith,"[8, 10]","I was a big fan of Major League, but was somewhat disappointed in Major League II, and as a result didn't buy Major League III for more than a year. I'm sorry about that, because it turned out to be as good as or better than any in terms of its story and execution, and casting.In the first Major League, we got a first class baseball story of unlikely heroes, which held up well even though I thought the personal lives of some of the players was stressed a little too much. In Major League II, which is still entertaining, I think the chemistry suffered because of this and other continuity issues. For instance, Wesley Snipes, the base stealing pheenom, was replaced by another actor, yet we are supposed to believe he's the same person. Doesn't quite work. Also, the love interest focus switched from Tom Berenger to Charlie Sheen, and we are supposed to know all about (and root for) a former girlfriend we have never seen before, and whose existence wasn't even hinted at in the first film. And finally, the chemistry suffered a little more because the feud between the owner and the players was reintroduced in an unlikely way (why would she buy the team back if she wanted to get out of Cleveland so bad in the first film?). Still the second film was enjoyable and worth having, even with these issues.So, I expected a lower budget, poorer result with Major League III, and boy, I was wrong. New characters and a new situations develop, and it all seems appropriate and fresh and the acting is top notch; the cast plays like a team and the script moves forward like a well-oiled machine. The music and photography are excellent and the action is in general spontaneous and very fun (like when the villan manager of the Twins hits himself in the head with a richocheting baseball). All the new characters carry off their roles extremely well, and all in all I think you should NOT skip this one if you like the series at all.",4,A diamond from the diamond,1097280000,"10 9, 2004",2004,1932,"['was', 'big', 'fan', 'Major', 'League', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'Major', 'League', 'II', 'result', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Major', 'League', 'III', 'more', 'year', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'terms', 'story', 'execution', 'casting.In', 'first', 'Major', 'League', 'got', 'first', 'class', 'baseball', 'story', 'unlikely', 'heroes', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'even', 'thought', 'personal', 'lives', 'players', 'was', 'stressed', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Major', 'League', 'II', 'still', 'entertaining', 'think', 'chemistry', 'suffered', 'other', 'continuity', 'issues', 'instance', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'base', 'stealing', 'pheenom', 'was', 'replaced', 'actor', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'same', 'person', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'Also', 'love', 'interest', 'focus', 'switched', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'are', 'supposed', 'know', 'root', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'existence', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'hinted', 'first', 'film', 'finally', 'chemistry', 'suffered', 'little', 'more', 'feud', 'owner', 'players', 'was', 'reintroduced', 'unlikely', 'way', 'why', 'would', 'buy', 'team', 'back', 'wanted', 'get', 'Cleveland', 'so', 'bad', 'first', 'film', 'Still', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'worth', 'having', 'even', 'issues.So', 'expected', 'lower', 'budget', 'poorer', 'result', 'Major', 'League', 'III', 'boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'New', 'characters', 'new', 'situations', 'develop', 'appropriate', 'fresh', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'cast', 'team', 'script', 'forward', 'well-oiled', 'machine', 'music', 'photography', 'are', 'excellent', 'action', 'general', 'spontaneous', 'very', 'fun', 'when', 'villan', 'manager', 'Twins', 'head', 'richocheting', 'baseball', 'new', 'characters', 'carry', 'off', 'roles', 'extremely', 'well', 'think', 'should', 'NOT', 'skip', 'one', 'like', 'series']",Major League: Back to the Minors VHS

And for that, it's a delightful comedy with some great moments.  It's not like an AIRPLANE spoof, but it does have some great comedic touches.Scott Bakula as Gus, the guy who always wanted to make it to the big leagues, is recruited by irrepressible Corbin Bernsen to coach his farm team, The Buzz.  Gus is reluctant, but after some persuasion by his lovely girl friend Jensen Daggett, he takes it on.  Of course, the team is full of misfits, guys with talents but no one has bothered to show them how to use them:  for instance, their ace hittere (Walt Goggins) is a smart-mouthed, self-centered home run hitter--but he can't hit anything else.  The catcher Rube (the delightful Erik Bruskotter) throws his catches over the wall; the outfielder, Pops Morgan, has gotten out of shape and needs to play first base; their pitcher is a cool dude who has one pitch--the fastball that everybody expects and hits out of the park; and another pitcher who pitches so slow, he doesn't even register on the speedometer!  Fortunately, Dennis Haysbert and Takaaki Ishibashi are back from the second movie, and they add not only some good hitting, but some wacky humor.Ted McGinley as the twin's pompous, selfloving manager, proves again how underappreciated he is.  Although having on a hit on TV's Hope and Faith, McGinley's never achieved the status he could have as the good looking, if disgusting, pretty boy!  He's great in this one.
