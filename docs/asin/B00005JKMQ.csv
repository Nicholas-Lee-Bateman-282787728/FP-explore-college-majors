As the credits began to roll however, I was a little dissapointed. The movie is very sluggish and seems to be forever explaining itself. It is also not what most people I have talked to expected. There isn't enough fighting, and I'm sorry but that's what was selling the movie from the beginning...Will Smith in the ring. I probably wouldn't recommend this movie to many, but you may enjoy it.",3,Ali nothing special,1042416000,"01 13, 2003",2003,500,"['Going', 'quot', 'Ali', 'quot', 'Micheal', 'Mann', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'absolutely', 'great', 'movie', 'credits', 'began', 'roll', 'however', 'was', 'little', 'dissapointed', 'movie', 'very', 'sluggish', 'be', 'forever', 'explaining', 'also', 'not', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'talked', 'expected', ""n't"", 'enough', 'fighting', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'what', 'was', 'selling', 'movie', 'beginning', 'Will', 'Smith', 'ring', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'many', 'may', 'enjoy']",Ali

588781,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00005JKMQ,Alex Udvary,"[0, 0]","Michael Mann's &quot;Ali&quot; is not really a bad film. But, I wouldn't go as far as to say it's a good film either. It's somewhere in the middle. Unlike Muhammad Ali himself, &quot;Ali&quot;, the film, doesn't pack much of a punch. It feels like the script, which was written by several people, including Mann himself, coulda used more time in the gym preparing. The film doesn't supply me with anything I don't know about Ali already! It doesn't tell me or teach me anything new about his life. It doesn't tell me what made Ali want to become a boxer. Who were his inspirations? None of this is revealed. People who know nothing about Ali's life will find to film to be not only entertaining, but, as an education into the life of a very controversial man. People whom are already fans of Ali will undoubtedly enjoy the film. Because after-all, if your a fan of the sports legend, you'll be happy to see anything about your hero's life. But, I'm not a fan of Ali on a personal level. So the story, right from the start had a lot to live up to if it was going to impress me. I admit though, I did end up liking the film more than I thought I would, but, not enough to recommend it to people.&quot;Ali&quot; is nicely directed by Mann, and has good performances by Jon Voight, who is probably one of my favorite things about the film. I was midly amused by Ron Silver and Jamie Foxx, and I thought Will Smith was OK, in the title role. Jada Pinkett Smith, I feel, strikes out. The problem with her is, there's no screen-time for her. She has nothing to work with. Infact, to be honest, the only bit of information I got out of &quot;Ali&quot; was, I didn't know the names of his wives.The other problem with &quot;Ali&quot; besides the screenplay is the fact that the story has no meaning. The story is not consist enough to keep our interest for the entire lenght of the film which is 2 hours and 47 minutes. It's not a strong enough of a story. &quot;Ali&quot; has moments also where it feels preachy a bit. It's too sentimental. Though, the film does have it's moments where it works. I really don't want to sound like &quot;Ali&quot; is an awful film. It's not. I've seen worst. But, like I said, if you know a lot about &quot;Ali&quot; you will not come away with anything you didn't know before. It's not like we all don't know who was going to win the championship in the &quot;rumble in the jungle&quot; fight.

588782,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JKMQ,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","On its face it is hard to see how a cinematic treatment of the life of Muhammad Ali (played here by Will Smith), the great prizefighter, could adequately portray the life he actually led. But that is indeed the case here. For those who grew up with him in mid-20th century America it is a nostalgic look back. For those too young to have known his life story this is a good primer of why many considered him one of the greatest athletics of all time and one why, friend or foe, considered him one hell of a man.I am not now nor was I then a fight fan. The part of Ali's career that interests me is his fight against black oppression, as he saw it. That in his youth he took a black separatist course joining the Nation of Islam in reaction to the rampart racism in America and American sports is understandable if not strategically the way forward for black liberation. The scenes with Malcolm X, who acted as something of a mentor, are among the best in the film.Ali was a man not only with a sports mission but a political mission. That became quite apparent when he, despite damage to his career and to his financial interests, refused to be inducted into the military during the Vietnam War period. His reasoning was simple-he had no quarrel with the Vietnamese. Many lesser figures, who now head the American government, were not nearly so forthright and skipped around the decisive political and moral event of the baby boomer generation. Hats off to Ali. Hats off to a great liberation fighter, who stood up when it counted.",4,STING LIKE A BEE,1172102400,"02 22, 2007",2007,1531,"['face', 'hard', 'see', 'how', 'cinematic', 'treatment', 'life', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'played', 'here', 'Will', 'Smith', 'great', 'prizefighter', 'could', 'adequately', 'portray', 'life', 'actually', 'led', 'indeed', 'case', 'here', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'America', 'nostalgic', 'look', 'back', 'too', 'young', 'have', 'known', 'life', 'story', 'good', 'primer', 'why', 'many', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'athletics', 'time', 'one', 'why', 'friend', 'foe', 'considered', 'one', 'hell', 'man.I', 'am', 'not', 'now', 'was', 'then', 'fight', 'fan', 'part', 'Ali', 'career', 'interests', 'fight', 'black', 'oppression', 'saw', 'youth', 'took', 'black', 'separatist', 'course', 'joining', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'reaction', 'rampart', 'racism', 'America', 'American', 'sports', 'understandable', 'not', 'strategically', 'way', 'forward', 'black', 'liberation', 'scenes', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'who', 'acted', 'something', 'mentor', 'are', 'best', 'film.Ali', 'was', 'man', 'not', 'only', 'sports', 'mission', 'political', 'mission', 'became', 'quite', 'apparent', 'when', 'damage', 'career', 'financial', 'interests', 'refused', 'be', 'inducted', 'military', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'period', 'reasoning', 'was', 'simple-he', 'had', 'quarrel', 'Vietnamese', 'Many', 'lesser', 'figures', 'who', 'now', 'head', 'American', 'government', 'were', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'forthright', 'skipped', 'decisive', 'political', 'moral', 'event', 'baby', 'boomer', 'generation', 'Ali', 'Hats', 'great', 'liberation', 'fighter', 'who', 'stood', 'up', 'when', 'counted']",Ali
588783,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JKMQ,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I really wanted to LOVE this movie.  Even all these years later, I felt the need to give it another try, hoping that I would fall in love with it.  I have a fascination with boxing and biopics, and so this seemed to be right up my ally.It wasn't.I'll go ahead and get the good out of the way before I lay in to this film.Will Smith is simply brilliant.  The material may not always give him the best to work with (why is it that Smith's films constantly fail him?) but he really works magic with what he is given.  From the mannerisms to the physicality to the voice to the sheer magnetic drive, Smith understands Ali and delivers a mesmerizing performance that never once feels like cheap mimicry.  He is creating a character for us, despite the obvious `factual' draw.  The rest of the cast is hit or miss (Voight is a miss, Foxx is a hit) but they don't really matter when you consider the fact that this is Smith's show.  I also (somewhat) appreciate Michael Mann's direction here.  There is a gritty realism that Mann brings to some of his films (`The Insider' is a perfect example of this), and he brings that here as well.  I appreciate that Mann is NOT trying to be Oliver Stone (thankfully) but he does at times find himself hindered in areas that feel very much like Stone-failures here, but overall I think that his sharp direction (while no where near as polished as his work in `Heat' or even `Collateral') helps elevate `Ali' in areas where it certainly needs a boost.And then, there is the bad.Like I kind of already mentioned, Mann's direction is not without its flaws.  I think it's more his vision than his actual direction, but he seems to get muddled in his own viewpoint.  The film, at times, meanders around without any real solidified purpose.  It just kind of hangs there.  In fact, the film takes quite some time even to start establishing character, which was a poor decision, and then when it does attempt to build on WHO and WHAT Ali was, it can get a little uneven and lazy.  What I love so much about biopics is that they can really flesh out the soul of someone you admire or at least harbor some interest in, but `Ali' comes off a tad scattered and unfocused to really do that.In the end, `Ali' fails to really live up to the name.  It needed a sharper edit and a tighter script to deliver a swifter punch in order to make it really do the subject justice.  Smith is simply marvelous, and so one should see it for his engrossing performance, but don't expect this to deliver in a totally fulfilling sense.",3,Take it on the chin...,1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,2537,"['really', 'wanted', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'Even', 'years', 'later', 'felt', 'need', 'give', 'try', 'hoping', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'have', 'fascination', 'boxing', 'biopics', 'so', 'seemed', 'be', 'right', 'ally.It', ""wasn't.I"", ""'ll"", 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'good', 'out', 'way', 'lay', 'film.Will', 'Smith', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'material', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'give', 'best', 'work', 'why', 'Smith', 'films', 'constantly', 'fail', 'really', 'magic', 'what', 'given', 'mannerisms', 'physicality', 'voice', 'sheer', 'magnetic', 'drive', 'Smith', 'Ali', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'never', 'once', 'feels', 'cheap', 'mimicry', 'creating', 'character', 'obvious', 'factual', 'draw', 'rest', 'cast', 'hit', 'miss', 'Voight', 'miss', 'Foxx', 'hit', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'when', 'consider', 'fact', 'Smith', 'show', 'also', 'somewhat', 'appreciate', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'direction', 'here', 'gritty', 'realism', 'Mann', 'films', 'Insider', 'perfect', 'example', 'that', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'appreciate', 'Mann', 'NOT', 'trying', 'be', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'thankfully', 'times', 'find', 'hindered', 'areas', 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'Stone-failures', 'here', 'overall', 'think', 'sharp', 'direction', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'polished', 'work', 'Heat', 'even', 'Collateral', 'elevate', 'Ali', 'areas', 'where', 'certainly', 'boost.And', 'then', 'bad.Like', 'kind', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Mann', 'direction', 'not', 'flaws', 'think', 'more', 'vision', 'actual', 'direction', 'get', 'muddled', 'own', 'viewpoint', 'film', 'times', 'meanders', 'real', 'solidified', 'purpose', 'just', 'kind', 'hangs', 'there', 'fact', 'film', 'quite', 'time', 'even', 'start', 'establishing', 'character', 'was', 'poor', 'decision', 'then', 'when', 'attempt', 'build', 'WHO', 'WHAT', 'Ali', 'was', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'uneven', 'lazy', 'What', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'biopics', 'can', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'soul', 'someone', 'admire', 'least', 'harbor', 'interest', 'Ali', 'tad', 'scattered', 'unfocused', 'really', 'do', 'that.In', 'end', 'Ali', 'fails', 'really', 'live', 'up', 'name', 'needed', 'sharper', 'edit', 'tighter', 'script', 'deliver', 'swifter', 'punch', 'order', 'make', 'really', 'do', 'subject', 'justice', 'Smith', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'so', 'one', 'should', 'see', 'engrossing', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'deliver', 'totally', 'fulfilling', 'sense']",Ali
588784,A1R90KXMPXCAP,B00005JKMQ,Andrew,"[0, 0]","For a three hour movie, this movie had remarkably little content. Althought biographical, it only covered a few years of his life, not even his complete boxing career. There were many unnecessary scenes that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. For example, there was about 20 minutes of Ali jogging (around two hours into the movie) in preparation for the famous &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; fight. During these 15 -20 minutes, the only dialouge is some Africans chanting something which translated to (I think) &quot;fear Ali.&quot; This scene has no point, and I think it was just put there because they wanted to make the movie longer. There were many other examples, but that one was the worst.Also, the movie was poorly directed during the boxing scenes. I often found myself wondering who was punching who. The camera angles were often poor. Also, some characters just materialized without introduction. For example, (I don't want to give away  too much) but Ali's second wife just comes out of nowhere. The audience is never told that he even got a divorce, let alone that he remarried. This happened a couple of times in the movie.On the positive side, Will Smith did an excellent job, as did most of the cast. Smith captured the arrogance, and hypocritical idealogy of Ali very well. Also, that Smith was actually made to look like Muhammed Ali is a miracle of film making.Overall, an OK movie marred by trying to be more epic than it was, and poor direction.",3,Too much filler,1009584000,"12 29, 2001",2001,1482,"['three', 'hour', 'movie', 'movie', 'had', 'remarkably', 'little', 'content', 'Althought', 'biographical', 'only', 'covered', 'few', 'years', 'life', 'not', 'even', 'complete', 'boxing', 'career', 'were', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'rest', 'movie', 'example', 'was', '20', 'minutes', 'Ali', 'jogging', 'two', 'hours', 'movie', 'preparation', 'famous', 'quot', 'Rumble', 'Jungle', 'quot', 'fight', '15', '-20', 'minutes', 'only', 'dialouge', 'Africans', 'chanting', 'something', 'translated', 'think', 'quot', 'fear', 'Ali.', 'quot', 'scene', 'point', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'put', 'there', 'wanted', 'make', 'movie', 'longer', 'were', 'many', 'other', 'examples', 'one', 'was', 'worst.Also', 'movie', 'was', 'poorly', 'directed', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'often', 'found', 'wondering', 'who', 'was', 'punching', 'who', 'camera', 'angles', 'were', 'often', 'poor', 'Also', 'characters', 'just', 'materialized', 'introduction', 'example', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'Ali', 'second', 'wife', 'just', 'nowhere', 'audience', 'never', 'told', 'even', 'got', 'divorce', 'let', 'alone', 'remarried', 'happened', 'couple', 'times', 'movie.On', 'positive', 'side', 'Will', 'Smith', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'did', 'most', 'cast', 'Smith', 'captured', 'arrogance', 'hypocritical', 'idealogy', 'Ali', 'very', 'well', 'Also', 'Smith', 'was', 'actually', 'made', 'look', 'Muhammed', 'Ali', 'miracle', 'film', 'making.Overall', 'OK', 'movie', 'marred', 'trying', 'be', 'more', 'epic', 'was', 'poor', 'direction']",Ali
588785,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00005JKMQ,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Like almost every cinematic bio, Michael Mann's ALI is necessarily episodic and contains a number of factual errors. The most glaring: Howard Cosell didn't call the Rumble in the Jungle (it was David Frost). The ""Ali comes out to meet Frazier, Frazier starts to retreat..."" doggerel was actually recited prior to the first Sonny Liston fight. Belinda's argument with Muhammad over his GF happened in Manila, not Zaire.Although he little resembles the brawnier Ali, Will Smith has the champ's vocal inflections down and he does a credible job in ring sequences. Jon Voight really channels Howard Cosell. The voice is so right, close your eyes when this actor speaks and it's as if Howard lives again.This two-and-a half-plus hour film covers Ali's life and boxing career up to his 1974 underdog victory in Zaire over a much-younger George Foreman. The Liston fights are here, plus Ernie Terrell's ""What's my name?""thrubbing by Ali, the bloodying of Jerry Quarry and extended recreations of the first match with Joe Frazier. There's fragments of their second bout, but that's about it for ring scenes. No Thrilla in Manila or Jimmy Ellis breaking Ali's jaw. Nothing on George ChuvaloThe script doesn't shy away from Ali's marriage troubles, and makes clear that he knew both Herbert Muhammad and Don King were opportunistic money grubbers. Ali's dealings with Malcolm X are here, as is that activist's public murder. The champ's opposition to the Vietnam War, charges of draft dodging that resulted in a 3 year suspension from boxing and loss of his title are also of primary importance.In the boxing bio genre there's only a handful of films that are this one's superior. Among them areRAGING BULL(1980), the Jake LaMotta story starring Robert DeNiro,THE GREAT WHITE HOPE(1970), a play adaptation with James Earl Jones as Jack Johnson (first black heavyweight champ), andROCKY MARCIANO(1999) with Jon Favreau, a TV movie about the only undefeated heavyweight champion.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(6.7) Ali (2001) - Will Smith/Jamie Foxx/Jon Voight/Mario Van Peebles/Ron Silver/Jeffrey Wright/Jada Pinkett Smith/Paul Rodriguez/Bruce McGill/Giancarlo Esposito/LeVar Burton/Michael Dorn",4,"""It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe."" --- Muhammad Ali",1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,2228,"['almost', 'cinematic', 'bio', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'ALI', 'necessarily', 'episodic', 'number', 'factual', 'errors', 'most', 'glaring', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'did', ""n't"", 'call', 'Rumble', 'Jungle', 'was', 'David', 'Frost', 'Ali', 'out', 'meet', 'Frazier', 'Frazier', 'retreat', 'doggerel', 'was', 'actually', 'recited', 'prior', 'first', 'Sonny', 'Liston', 'fight', 'Belinda', 'argument', 'Muhammad', 'GF', 'happened', 'Manila', 'not', 'little', 'brawnier', 'Ali', 'Will', 'Smith', 'champ', 'vocal', 'inflections', 'down', 'credible', 'job', 'ring', 'sequences', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'really', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'voice', 'so', 'right', 'close', 'eyes', 'when', 'actor', 'Howard', 'again.This', 'two-and-a', 'half-plus', 'hour', 'film', 'Ali', 'life', 'boxing', 'career', '1974', 'underdog', 'victory', 'Zaire', 'much-younger', 'George', 'Foreman', 'Liston', 'fights', 'are', 'here', 'Ernie', 'Terrell', 'What', 'name', 'thrubbing', 'Ali', 'bloodying', 'Jerry', 'Quarry', 'extended', 'recreations', 'first', 'match', 'Joe', 'Frazier', 'fragments', 'second', 'bout', 'ring', 'scenes', 'Thrilla', 'Manila', 'Jimmy', 'Ellis', 'breaking', 'Ali', 'jaw', 'Nothing', 'George', 'ChuvaloThe', 'script', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'Ali', 'marriage', 'troubles', 'clear', 'knew', 'Herbert', 'Muhammad', 'Don', 'King', 'were', 'opportunistic', 'money', 'grubbers', 'Ali', 'dealings', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'are', 'here', 'activist', 'public', 'murder', 'champ', 'opposition', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'charges', 'draft', 'dodging', 'resulted', '3', 'year', 'suspension', 'boxing', 'loss', 'title', 'are', 'also', 'primary', 'importance.In', 'boxing', 'bio', 'genre', 'only', 'handful', 'films', 'are', 'one', 'superior', 'areRAGING', 'BULL', '1980', 'Jake', 'LaMotta', 'story', 'starring', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'WHITE', 'HOPE', '1970', 'play', 'adaptation', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Jack', 'Johnson', 'first', 'black', 'heavyweight', 'champ', 'andROCKY', 'MARCIANO', '1999', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'TV', 'movie', 'only', 'undefeated', 'heavyweight', 'champion.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'IMDb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.7', 'Ali', '2001', 'Will', 'Smith/Jamie', 'Foxx/Jon', 'Voight/Mario', 'Van', 'Peebles/Ron', 'Silver/Jeffrey', 'Wright/Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith/Paul', 'Rodriguez/Bruce', 'McGill/Giancarlo', 'Esposito/LeVar', 'Burton/Michael', 'Dorn']",Ali
588786,A1WB5NZYY5XR8A,B00005JKMQ,"Ash1138 ""Just a middle aged guy living in Col...","[3, 3]","Michael Mann has got to be one of the best and also one of the most overlooked directors in Hollywood. I'm a big fan of his work and will see any film on the sole basis of seeing his name in the credits [as director], but when I mention to most people about my excitement of a new movie coming out by Michael Mann all I generally receive are puzzled looks.Mann's last two films, Heat and The Insider, rank among my favorite films of all time so naturally I was more than excited to see his latest film, Ali. This film has all the magic of Mann's visionary directing as well his amazing ability to get the most out of any actor. Will Smith (who I think is a horrible actor) gives a surprising good performance and who would have thought Jon Voight and Howard Cosell were in fact the same person? Unfortunately there isn't much of a story to make all the pieces worth putting together.As a biopic I don't expect to find the traditional set-up/conflict/climax method of storytelling, but neither do I expect to see the complete lack of cohesion this film seems to have. This film jumps to different points throughout many of the famous parts of Ali's life seemingly without rhyme or reason.The film is an interesting look into the life of a very interesting individual, and Mann's directing along with wonderful performances from all the film's actor are enough to take away the pain of the poor screenplay.

While Will Smith was praised for his impressive physical transformation into legendary boxer Muhammed Ali, the film itself was criticized for revealing nothing new about the man. Herein lies the problem that Michael Mann and company faced: how do you shed new light on one of the most documented historical figures of the 20th Century? Like he did with The Last of the Mohicans, Mann has revisited Ali again on DVD with a new cut of the film. He's taken out approximately 20 minutes of footage and put 30 minutes of previously unseen footage back in. The effect? Hard to tell unless you've seen the film many times but Mann claims that the politics of the times are more the focus this time around.There is an audio commentary by writer/director Michael Mann. He does an excellent job of putting the film into its historical context. The director clearly did his homework and points out who everyone is and the significance of the events depicted in the movie which is a nice consideration for viewers not familiar with this particular period of time. This is an extremely informative track and Mann contributes many very thoughtful observations over the course of the movie.""The Making of Ali"" is a 29-minute featurette that originally aired on HBO. It is slightly better than your average electronic press kit and features some decent on the set footage and interview sound bites with Mann and various members of the cast.Ali eschews the traditional docudrama for a more impressionistic take on the man and life. Mann's film may not say anything new about the famous boxer, but it does depict an exciting ten years of his life in a masterful and richly evocative fashion. This DVD features an excellent transfer of the movie with an aggressive 5.1 surround soundtrack and is definitely worth purchasing for Mann fans for his audio commentary alone.",5,Mann's Underrated Take on Legendary Boxer,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,1917,"['When', 'Ali', 'was', 'released', '2001', 'received', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'Will', 'Smith', 'was', 'praised', 'impressive', 'physical', 'transformation', 'legendary', 'boxer', 'Muhammed', 'Ali', 'film', 'was', 'criticized', 'revealing', 'nothing', 'new', 'man', 'Herein', 'problem', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'company', 'faced', 'how', 'do', 'shed', 'new', 'light', 'one', 'most', 'documented', 'historical', 'figures', '20th', 'Century', 'did', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Mann', 'revisited', 'Ali', 'again', 'DVD', 'new', 'cut', 'film', 'taken', 'out', 'approximately', '20', 'minutes', 'footage', 'put', '30', 'minutes', 'previously', 'unseen', 'footage', 'back', 'effect', 'Hard', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'Mann', 'politics', 'times', 'are', 'more', 'focus', 'time', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'excellent', 'job', 'putting', 'film', 'historical', 'context', 'director', 'clearly', 'did', 'homework', 'points', 'out', 'who', 'everyone', 'significance', 'events', 'depicted', 'movie', 'nice', 'consideration', 'viewers', 'not', 'familiar', 'particular', 'period', 'time', 'extremely', 'informative', 'track', 'Mann', 'many', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'observations', 'course', 'movie', 'Making', 'Ali', '29-minute', 'featurette', 'originally', 'aired', 'HBO', 'slightly', 'better', 'average', 'electronic', 'press', 'kit', 'decent', 'set', 'footage', 'interview', 'sound', 'Mann', 'various', 'members', 'cast.Ali', 'traditional', 'docudrama', 'more', 'impressionistic', 'take', 'man', 'life', 'Mann', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'new', 'famous', 'boxer', 'depict', 'exciting', 'ten', 'years', 'life', 'masterful', 'richly', 'evocative', 'fashion', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'movie', 'aggressive', '5.1', 'surround', 'soundtrack', 'definitely', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'Mann', 'fans', 'audio', 'commentary', 'alone']",Ali

Sanderman,"[1, 2]","The opening ten-minute sequence of ALI is visually and emotionally stunning: we are treated to a classic scene of Cassius Clay out training for a fight while images flash of the history and time period, all set to music.  Like other reviewers, while the film does not (and cannot) maintain the intensity and glory of this opening sequence, ALI is still a film that delivers on several levels.  First of all, I believe the acting deserves special notice.  Will Smith outdoes himself in this film and proved to me, once again, that he has more talent than I give him credit for.  His performance as the film's protagonist is moving and charged.  Smith has mastered ""the voice"" and continues to assault the camera and those around him with its dangerous ammunition.  On top of Smith's performance, the entire cast seems to be on fire in this film.  Jamie Foxx, one of the most talented actors working right now, delivers a strange and effective performance.But while ALI manages to be an effective film, I was left wondering many of the questions that have plagued other reviewers: Why is he like this?  What is the deep-seeded reason for this maddening ten years?  While Smith manages to give us a wonderful recreation of Ali's public self, we fail to glimpse the inner emotion of the man.  Of course, there IS some depth to the character.  While the film spends much of its time glamorizing the man, Ali's improper decision making and moral confusion do detract from his character.  We are not given a flat superhero to watch for almost three hours.  But that being said, the film does fail to convey a real sense of why he is the way he is, of what is driving him.  I do not believe it is Smith's fault: I think the film lacks the necessary depth and complexity to answer these questions.Despite its flaws, ALI is still worth a look.  It captures the time period and its political tension better than many other films and Smith's performance as Ali is just as snappy, witty, and volatile as the original.",3,Stunning Solo Performance that Lacks Depth & Motivation,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2004,"['opening', 'ten-minute', 'sequence', 'ALI', 'visually', 'emotionally', 'stunning', 'are', 'treated', 'classic', 'scene', 'Cassius', 'Clay', 'out', 'training', 'fight', 'images', 'flash', 'history', 'time', 'period', 'set', 'music', 'other', 'reviewers', 'film', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'maintain', 'intensity', 'glory', 'opening', 'sequence', 'ALI', 'still', 'film', 'several', 'levels', 'First', 'believe', 'acting', 'deserves', 'special', 'notice', 'Will', 'Smith', 'outdoes', 'film', 'proved', 'once', 'again', 'more', 'talent', 'give', 'credit', 'performance', 'film', 'protagonist', 'moving', 'charged', 'Smith', 'mastered', 'voice', 'assault', 'camera', 'dangerous', 'ammunition', 'top', 'Smith', 'performance', 'entire', 'cast', 'be', 'fire', 'film', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'actors', 'working', 'right', 'now', 'strange', 'effective', 'performance.But', 'ALI', 'be', 'effective', 'film', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'many', 'questions', 'have', 'plagued', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Why', 'What', 'deep-seeded', 'reason', 'maddening', 'ten', 'years', 'Smith', 'manages', 'give', 'wonderful', 'recreation', 'Ali', 'public', 'self', 'fail', 'glimpse', 'inner', 'emotion', 'man', 'course', 'depth', 'character', 'film', 'much', 'time', 'glamorizing', 'man', 'Ali', 'improper', 'decision', 'making', 'moral', 'confusion', 'do', 'detract', 'character', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'flat', 'superhero', 'watch', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'fail', 'convey', 'real', 'sense', 'why', 'way', 'what', 'driving', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'Smith', 'fault', 'think', 'film', 'necessary', 'depth', 'complexity', 'answer', 'questions.Despite', 'flaws', 'ALI', 'still', 'worth', 'look', 'time', 'period', 'political', 'tension', 'better', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Smith', 'performance', 'Ali', 'just', 'snappy', 'witty', 'volatile', 'original']",Ali

Yes, the latter match with Ali vs. Foreman displays a lot of that ol' in your face, grit and determination these two put into every punch thrown. The first match vs. Sonny Liston lacks that very fire, heart and gusto present in the George Foreman bout. Due to the fact the Ali-Liston fight featured in the film is simulated, doesn't win any popularity contests with many who view(ed) this feature (myself included). Nevertheless, it was an effect that had to be included to heighten the realism of the movie. The Foreman bout, although simulated to a degree as well, looked as if Will Smith and the other actor had to train to withstand those punches. This particular fight comes across well on the big screen, and is dramatic, no doubt. Now, on to Muhammad Ali's life, as portrayed by Smith in the film. Overall, Smith does a good job in capturing the essence of Ali's character, in that he hardly misses a step in quantifying a trait the real Ali was famous for - that being his arrogance and confidence inside (as well as outside) the boxing ring. As far as Ali's religious affiliation (as noted in the film) is concerned, it is surprising to note that Ali was expelled from the Muslim religion, for reasons poorly conveyed in the film. Therefore, the viewer is not given any explanation as for the cause of Muhammad Ali's expulsion from Islam. Ali is later reinstated in the Muslim religion, for reasons unknown according to the film. The character of Howard Cosell, as portrayed by Jon Voight, lacks two main characteristics - one, Voight fails to capture the physical essence of Cosell in both profile and voice, the latter of which is only 50 to 75% accurate. Two, Cosell's putdowns of Ali come across as raw and somewhat uninspiring here. It is also surprising that Ali and Cosell became good friends off camera (were they really?), and not so surprising these two were adversaries on the proverbial TV screen. Again, it is quite possible that Hollywood used the friendship scenario to draw the viewer into the movie. As far as this picture being fact-based is concerned, there is a rather distinct possibility that it may very well be, but I, for one, am not quite sold on that premise. So, in order to weigh the pros and cons of &quot;Ali&quot;, you'll just have to see it and decide for yourself.",3,&quot;The Greatest&quot; Movie?

In many ways, this film is too ambitious in its effort to touch upon many of the complexities of the renowned heavyweight boxer; the film tries to include too much and therefore doesn't fully explore any one aspect.  As a result, this film feels incomplete despite its length.  Will Smith does an admirable job evoking Ali's outward charm and unreadable emotions, but this public mask often obscures a more intimate exploration.  The film succeeds best in more private moments, one on one with other characters, although Will Smith's evocation of Ali's public rhyming is dead-on.  The documentation of some of Ali's personal struggles (many of which I was not previously aware of) are both moving and politically/socially charged.  At other points, scenes drag on as though the director could not decide when to stop.  The acting is good to exceptional, with no one glaringly miscast.As a Will Smith fan, I could not pass up this film despite mixed reviews.  I'm glad I finally saw it.  However, I don't recommend it for everyone because of its numerous flaws.  If you are a Will Smith or Muhammad Ali fan, you should definitely see it.

He doesn't deliver that witty repertoire like the man himself. His voice actually trails off a lot of the time. Listen carefully and you'll see what I mean. Likewise, that expression on his face...He looks perpetually scared! I know many will disagree with me, but I think Smith was the wrong choice to play Ali.Michael Mann directed the excellent ""The Insider"" so I was expecting more from this film. It isn't really much more than a retrospective of part of Ali's career. And most people know this part of the story. Ali wins the heavyweight title, converts to Nation of Islam, befriends Howard Cosell, gets screwed by the system, comes back and beats Foreman. No surprises there.I was REALLY hoping the film would have focused on the more interesting and tragic part of Ali's career that followed the fight in Zaire. You know, when he got older, fought Frazier in Manila, turned to Sunni Islam, lost and regained the title from Leon Spinks, got screwed over by Don King, came back to fight Larry Holmes but was humiliated, retired and suffered from Parkinsons Syndrome, lit the torch at Atlanta, etc.I was hoping for more of a biopic kind of feel.""Ali"" disappoints in this regard. It only focuses on 1966-1972. This is a shame. I think they could have shortened some of the fight scenes. I mean, this wasn't supposed to be a ""Rocky"" film but rather a film about Ali the man.""Ali"" is stylish and if you don't know a lot about Ali, you might enjoy this. I mean, it's a fascinating story up to that point. It's just something that's been told over water coolers and even at lecture halls all these years that you probably already know it.Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Drew Bundini is great. I keep raving about how talented Mr. Foxx is. The way he took an obscure character and made it his own is remarkable. It might be worth waiting for this to air on cable just to see Foxx's performance.I should add that the soundtrack for this movie is very good.

588807,A1L0HZI35HF8OF,B00005JKMQ,Eric V. Moye,"[3, 3]","Some  films are made great by their by action, others by being a great story, others by the soundtrack or special effects.  This movie like a few others was made by one characterization.  Will Smith IS Muhammad Ali, primarily because he has worked to make Ali's voice and inflections his own.  It is an incredibly convincing performance, and to the reviewer who said that Smith could not capture Ali, I ask whom he would suggest instead?  It is hard for me to disagree more with another Amazon[.com] colleague, and I would instead concur with another reviewer who noted this film shows the ability to have a single Oscar-caliber performance in a film which even the biggest fans acknowledge is not likely to be the best film of the year.I guess the real challenge accepted and dealt with admirably by Director Michael Mann comes with making a film about not just someone we all know, but THE most recognized person in the world..  How can this story be told in just two hours?  As some of the detractors have made clear, this is a tough task.  But Mann did a great job, in my opinion.Where to start this story; and where to end it?  No mention of the young boy's going to learn to box after some neighborhood kids humiliate him by stealing his bicycle.  No mention (rather surprisingly) of his Olympic gold medal and the even more significant return to the States where he threw his medal into a river in protest of racial mistreatment.  And even once we get that issue resolved, where to end this saga?  How about Summer, 1996 in Atlanta, with the Champ holding the Olympic torch (or even better, at a preliminary boxing match in those same Olympics when an incredibly bitter Joe Frazier was, when introduced, met by cheers of ""Ali, Ali!"").  This is by no means a criticism, because this one incredible life is far too large to capture in one movie.Those who lament the lack of great boxing misunderstand what the film and Ali were all about.  He transcended his sport in a manner that no athlete has in the past fifty years (and perhaps ever).  America in the 1960's, racism, and the draft were far larger issues and more formidable competitors for him than Liston, Frazier, Foreman could have been if he had to fight all three one after the other!  If all he had done was fight and defeat them, he would have been just one more name in the record books.  This leads to my only real substantive lament:  While the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" was a singular and a true epic event, I think the three Frazier bouts were the greatest one-on-one competitions in the history of sport, and were among the defining moments of their respective careers.  For this reason, I would have like to have seen more time devoted to that relationship.Great supporting actors.  Before seeing this, I could not imagine Jon Voight as Howard Cosell (just like Will Smith, Voight also made this role his own merely with the use of tonal inflection).  Ditto the efforts of Jamie Foxx as Drew Bundini Brown.  Mario Van Peebles would have been memorable as Malcolm X, but for the fact that we ALL know that he could never again be portrayed after the efforts of Denzel Washington.Just like the Man himself, some people liked him, and some people hated him.  Not surprisingly, the reviews turned our correspondingly.  It is, as noted a better than respectful telling of the life of a great figure in the history of America.

588808,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005JKMQ,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 4]","Muhammad Ali was so much bigger than life that any biopic is likely to have come up short.  But to those of us who grew up watching Ali in his prime, this film is a real disappointment.Director Michael Mann is a highly talented director with films like ""Heat"", ""The Insider"" and ""Last of the Mohicans"" to his credit.  Yet, in this film he takes the wrong tack and clutters it with boring details and excessive focus on racial issues that were ancillary to the life of a very exciting boxer and a dynamic showman.To do justice to Ali's entire life, you would have to make three films.  One for the boxing, one to look behind the scenes of a complicated man, and one to chronicle his interaction with the Nation of Islam and the civil rights implications of his refusal to be inducted into the army.  The most interesting of the three are the first two.  Yet, Mann decides to give us the first and third elements with the greatest emphasis on the civil rights angle, which is clearly the least interesting aspect of Ali despite the controversy.  It seems that Mann is on a crusade to impress us with what a central figure Ali was in the civil rights movement and that his boxing was secondary to that role.  Mann wants us to believe that Ali was a civil rights leader who just happened to be a boxer, when in reality he was first and foremost an outstanding boxer with a flamboyant and arrogant attitude and a rapier wit.Mann completely neglects the element that he presents so superbly in ""The Insider"", the character development of the main character.  In ""The Insider"", Mann drills deep into Wigand's (Russell Crowe) psyche and turns Bergman (Al Pacino) inside out.  In ""Ali"", Mann glosses over Ali's motivations and concentrates more on Ali as part of a larger mosaic rather than the fascinating character he really was.  He only gives a hint of the close relationship between Ali and Cosell, which could have been a film by itself.The boxing scenes were well choreographed, but overly long with too much emphasis on too few fights.  Ali was one of the most active heavyweight champion ever, sometimes fighting four or five times per year, but from this film it seems like he had only four fights in his career.  We didn't need to see 15 minutes of George Foreman pounding Ali against the ropes to get the idea.Will Smith does an excellent job of portraying Ali.  Though he sometimes misses on Ali's rapid fire poetic cadence, he hits the mark a high percentage of the time and delivers a very realistic portrayal.  In the ring, he does a passable job of imitating some of Ali's more notable moves like the ""Ali Shuffle"" and his penchant for dodging punches with his hands dangling by his side.  But no one can come close to imitating that lightning jab.As much acclaim as Smith got for this role, John Voight steals the show as Howard Cosell.  Though the physical resemblance is not that great, Voight's command of Howard's movements and speech patterns is nothing short of phenomenal.One thing that is very disappointing is that the DVD has absolutely no bonus material.  This is a topic that could have provided hours of background material and original footage and there wasn't even a featurette.Overall, this film is entertaining for those who never saw Ali fight, or bad mouth an opponent in a new conference.  But for those of us who were lucky enough to see this brilliant athlete and flamboyant personality in his prime, this film never leaves the ground.  I rated it a 6/10.

Isn't it neurotic to stay in the USA and allow the US white establishment to ruin my own sources (financially and mentally)? In the heart of all considerations is Ali's refusal to be drafted into the Army. His favorite sentences: (1) ""Why should I go to Vietnam killing people who never said NIGGER to me?"" (2) ""The USA is my enemy, not the Vietcong..."" these sentences, sent from abroad, would have developed their power as well, would have been a more effective support of his ""boxing for justice and liberty"" with shaky methods. And secondly I thought, watching this DVD: ""The Clash Of Civilizations"", the present never ending feud between Christian establishment and Muslim neighborhoods - did this start in the 1960's, when Muhammad Ali and America's fiery civil-rights leader Malcolm X became great political heroes? Nowadays: Ain't there any ways to respect each other? Is the present society a better one as the scene in the years 1964 - 1974, which brought Muhammad Ali a very bitter life? The fresh occurrence of this screen-work made me think like this, and I am convinced, some other viewers will feel similar things.

588811,A1WOFFWF8UYPJ2,B00005JKMQ,Gerald Booth,"[6, 7]","The movie focuses on the time between when a young Cassius Clay first wins the Heavyweight Championship of the World from Sonny Liston and when a 32 year old Muhammad Ali regains the Championship from George Foreman at the Rumble in the Jungle.  The movie focuses less on Ali in the ring andmore on his life outside.  You see the multiple marriages, his conversion to Islam, his fractured relationship with Malcolm X, and most importantly his battle with the United States Courts when Ali refused to serve in Viet Nam.Michael Mann directs this in his usual visual intense style.  If you have ever seen a production by Mann (Miami Vice, The Last of the Mohicanns, and The Insider to name a small few) you know that he deals with a variety of colors to focus the movie and the scenery tells the story almost as muchas the script.The acting is superb by almost everyone involved in the movie but a few people really stand out.  Will Smith proves that Robert De Niro is not the only one who will gain weight by packing about 20 to 30 pounds of muscle on his frame and then completely immerses himself in the cadence and styleof Ali's speech.  Few actors today would seem to have the capability to spout off some of Ali's tirades as Will does.  Jamie Foxx does an incredible job as Bundini Brown.  His breakdown on drugs and the fight back to sobriety shows that this former In Living Color co-star can handle a great deal morethan we originally thought.  The surprise of the movie was Jon Voight. People have portrayed Howard Cosell before but Voight actually becomes him. He sounded like Cosell and the make-up job was so detailed that I had to look a couple of times before I was able to actually recognize Voight.  The relationship between Ali and Cosell is played up on many levels showing howeach actually helped catapult the other into the levels of stardom that they reached.The movie is very, very well done.  The script was tight and didn't stray into too many areas that would have dragged the movie down.

Smithis not convincing as the legendary champion,he delivers his lines basically withoutany emotion or comprehension of what he is sayingwith the only exception being when Smith recitesthe famous lines by Ali such as &quot;I am Kingof World. Sting like a butterfly float a bee&quot;.The only real good points about Ali is that itdoes show 3 factual things about the realAli. For instance, how Ali's real is CassiusClay, but after he joined the nation of Islamand Malcom X. He changed his named to Cassius X.Then after meeting the head of Islam,Elijah, Muhammed, he changedhis name to Muhammed Ali.Some people called it a landmark film, but it'snot. Some people even said that &quot;Ali&quot; showedAli as a great civil rights leader, but it didn'tdo that either.For instance , although &quot;Ali&quot; was friendswith both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King,he had only brief contact with them.Also was not totally supportive of Malcolm X(played well by Mario Van Peebles). Ali's manipulation by the nation of Islam and it's leader, drove a wedge between the friendship between Ali and Malcolm X.The film also shows how Ali was a contractingyoung man and older man. For instance,his mistreatment of his wife Sonji ( Jada Pinkett)after he follows the rule of Islam to discipline her.Now I as I said the acting in the film isreally bad. Will Smith, probably didn't doalot of research into the character of Ali, ashis lack of any feeling into some of theserious areas of the movie (like hisreaction to civil riots ,Malcolm X and thethreat of him going to prison for avoidingthe draft).I mean Smith does an ok job, when imitatingthe famous lines by Ali such as &quot;Float likea butterfly sting like a bee&quot;, or &quot;I am Kingof The World&quot;. But when it comes down todelivering real, reactions for Ali, Smithis both laughable and mediocre.For instance, there is a scene where Ali (Smith)sees the trouble of civil rights on tv, andyet his reaction is just something like &quot;Wow,or uh oh&quot;. LOL Then later on in the movie, whenAli is threatened with imprisonment for refusingto fight in the Vietnam War (yes he refused to fight), he basically just looks stonefaced, anddoesn't have the serious type of reaction youwould expect someone going to prison would have.However, there are a couple of good actors in themovie (not Smith)that prevents &quot;Ali&quot; from beinga total failure .Jon Voight is great as legendary, ego maniac,sports announcer Howard Cosell (who endedhis career in disgrace).Cosell was one of the biggest sportsvoices in history, he had memorableinterviews with Ali, sports team likethe Lakers and many other great sportsfigures, but by the end of his careerHoward's ego got the best of him, and eventually no one wanted to see this guyon the air.Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X, also deservessome honorable mention as he does get intoMalcolm X characters, and his view on thecivil rights movement, and some of hisproblems with Ali.The other big complaints about the film wasthat the film concentrated on the earlylife of Ali, but not his life afterwards inthe 1980's, as critc Roger Ebert states.Now the DVD for the film, like the film is a bitof a disappointment:The only bonus feature for the film isthe trailer.There is no behind the scenes look at the film, no&quot;making of&quot; featurette, no nothing.There is not even no commentary for the film!!!Michael Mann either was too busy,or too damn lazy to do the commentary, because it would have given him the chance to respondto the criticism for this part of the film,instead he chose not to do any commentaryfor the film and so the criticismfor the film will stand.In the end, while Michael Mann tried to do a fairattempt at the making of &quot;Ali&quot; there are alotof problems that prevent him from doing so.First, of, his main star , Will Smith, is justplain awful as &quot;Ali&quot; . Smith, probably gotpaid his millions for the film, but he ain'tworth it.Second, Mann, only covers the early years, and notthe later years for the legend, when he would takebeatings in the ring, and would later getParkinson's disease, which would leave Alipartially paralyzed and barely to speak (Alispeaks in mumbles).In the end, I can't recommend &quot;Ali&quot; becauseit just basically could have been a heck of alotbetter, and the dvd without the commentary , justbasically sums up the film as basically an averageattempt at creating a biography for the heavyweightchampion.The bright side, is that there is a new film/dvdwhich is a real biography on Ali, showing actualinterviews and clips of the real Ali, so you'rebetter of checking that one out than this movie.",1,Ali the DVD

Thus I had high expectations for this movie, but sadly it couldn't live up to them.The acting was fine, though. I also liked that there was so much included about his personal life, even though it wasn't the entire story. His relationships with a couple of women and his interactions with Malcolm X, as well as his choice not to fight in Vietnam and the consequences that followed were all documented in here, and fairly well at that. It's good that at the very least, this movie showed what Ali's life was like in the most dramatic years of his life.But as you may be able to guess, this story wasn't inclusive, and I was left with all sorts of questions about what happened before and after this climactic time period in Ali's life. There wasn't anything about his childhood, much less how and why he became a boxer. It's as if the movie expects you to come into it already knowing what happened before.The movie mainly focuses on his personal relationships, his religious identity, his issues with Vietnam, and his big fight in Zaire against Foreman. Even during some of these parts, his life is flashing so fast that I often had to rewind to figure what happened. Even though reading his biography afterwards helped me fill in the rest of the blanks, I shouldn't have had to do that. A biographical film is supposed to teach me most of what I want to know.And even though I don't blame this on Will Smith, I think Ali's character was a bit stiff in the movie. He wasn't very likable, to be honest. I know I shouldn't expect him to be all smiles and hugs, as real people are not like that, but his irritability didn't make the movie any more appealing.

I used to clip the articles about his fights out of the Washington Post when I was a little girl 9 and 10 years old. I even used to watch his cartoon show. So I'm not going to pretend to be Leonard Maltin and talk about film techniques and angles and crap like that which I don't care about anyway. I'm going to try to describe what I liked about it.To consider who would like this movie besides me, I would say that fans would have enjoyed seeing Muhammad Ali on the big screen. I, of course, remember him from the little screen, and if I had bought this VHS version instead of seeing it on the big screen, frankly I don't think I would have felt the power in all his punches like I did in the movie theatre. It was awesome, as I were the one being hit (not that I'd enjoy that)! Apartment dwellers like me who can't have high volume surround sound would truly miss out.I liked the story. I remember seeing the story of Emmitt Till in the Jet magazine, too, and how repulsed I was as a young child. I can understand the anger he must have felt.Then I wonder if white audiences will even get this movie. There's plenty that will be over their heads just from a cultural aspect. Are they going to understand why Ali was so moved to go to Africa, where they don't even have TV, and see his image drawn on the sides of houses and walls?I really enjoyed the performances of the actors. I think someone besides Jada Smith should have been his first wife, but I guess if your husband's going to do a love scene, may as well keep him close. The make-up artist for the movie should have gotten a nomination for making Angelina Jolie's father, Jon Voight, look as if he had undergone major plastic surgery; it was truly amazing.If the movie didn't play in your part of the world, I believe it's worth getting, although a better one which I'll recommend, is When We Were Kings.

However, it does not really matter, as most people already know the biography of Muhammad Ali anyway.Truly astonishing. How a very interesting life turned into one of the most pretentious and awful movies I have ever seen still amazes me. Before watching this movie, I did not know much about Muhammad Ali besides the fact that he was one of the greatest boxers (if not the greatest) in the history of boxing. What I learned from this movie was not much more.This is probably the most horribly edited movie I have ever seen. While it begins interesting, the story loses coherence as it jumps from one place in his life, to another. In fact, I did not even know the movie took place over a period of ten years until I read the biography afterwards, which helped fill in all the missing places in the movie, and was very interesting, whereas the movie was dull and boring. I did not know there was a 3 1/2 year gap between his arrest and the overturning of his conviction (the movie makes it almost seem like a couple months), they barely mentioned the restaurant chain in the movie, we never actually found out that it was a failed attempt, and most of all, the most confusing parts of the movie dealt with his love life. It was not known to any of us who were watching if the first woman, Sonji Roi played by Jada Pinkett Smith, actually ever married Ali. Because all they showed afterwards was her walking away from him, and then we see him dating someone else, we figured that they were never actually married, when in fact, they were, and the marriage was annulled. We also barely saw the marriage to Belinda the second woman, and then the third, Veronica is barely in the story anyway. We only find out at the very end that he divorced Belinda, to marry Veronica, and then apparently married another person, afterwards. (Are you counting? That's four wives.)I thought this movie was supposed to convey the greatness of Muhammad Ali, and show why he was so beloved by so many fans. All I saw was a man with many troubles in his love life and who was way too cocky. Where is this greatness that everyone is talking about? Surely it exists in the real Ali, but I don't see any of that greatness in this movie.The movie was not enough about the REAL Ali. Most of it was about his troubles with boxing, and the movie showed to us the face that he showed to the press and the outside world. But we do not get any of the real stuff we should be knowing; his dreams, hopes, real troubles...Perhaps it would have been better if they started earlier in his life too. Starting from 1964 when he became the World Heavyweight Champion was not a good choice, as there really is no goal for him from then on except to defend his title - I mean, he already became the World Champion, so the rest of the movie loses its meaning, as all he wants to do is regain it (Remember, 2nd time around is always not as thrilling). Also, if they recounted earlier aspects of his life, we would have more background knowledge of him, and perhaps understand the character a bit more. It would also have been wise to go past where they did stop, and continue through to his struggles with Parkinson's Disease, which would have also been interesting.Another problem I had was the incredibly long parts that should have been cut out. There was a scene several minutes long where he was just walking along and thinking. While a minute of this would have been nice, as it also gives the audience the feeling that he is thinking, and gives us a little insight into his character, several minutes worth of this is rather tiring and pointless.Still, there were some good points. The point where he refused to be drafted, and the recounting of that was very interesting, if not because of the actual movie, but because of the real events. The problem with the movie at this point was there was no struggle here. After he got arrested, a couple minutes later in the movie, the Supreme Court overrules it in his favour. We don't see the struggle, or his love for boxing here, as he struggled through those 3 1/2 years, and so we also don't appreciate the magnitude of the Supreme Court's ruling.Jamie Foxx did a very nice job, small as it was, and I also thought Mario von Peebles who played Malcolm X did a great performance, although that role was tiny. Will Smith's performance was excellent, despite the overwhelming incoherence of the movie, which made it look horrible. After reading the biography, I understood his performance much more, and was that much more impressed.Perhaps if it was edited well, this movie actually had the great potential to be one of the year's best. Instead, it is at the other extreme, as one of 2001's worst.And so, I cannot recommend this movie, but rather have to recommend people to never watch this worthless and horrible film. Read the biography instead. It was indescribably much more entertaining, interesting, and moving.",1,Amazing potential - ruined by poor editing,1009929600,"01 2, 2002",2002,5172,"['Even', 'something', 'Driven', 'was', 'better',

588826,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00005JKMQ,J from NY,"[0, 0]","Mann's ""Ali"" isn't a masterpiece by any means, but the cinematic car crash I expected to see didn't happen either.  People like Spike Lee and those actually involved with Ali's life (Larry Holmes, Joe Frazier) have ripped this movie to pieces and the critics have ridiculed it mercilessly.A lot of movies about national icons fail simply because they tackle figures that are larger than can be captured in the medium of film (Hoffa, The Doors, etc), and this is undeniably one of them--one of the more enjoyable ones, though.Mario Van Peebles does his best, and I think pretty well, at playing Malcolm X, whose abandonment by Ali is shown very clearly in this film.Will Smith is as good as he can be playing Muhammad Ali himself, and he captures that strange, childlike Southern tough guy voice damn near perfectly.  Jon Voight is just covered in makeup as Cosell; he's unrecognizable, and I'm surprised he didn't suffocate.  To give him any credit for his performance would be as meaningless as saying one of the monkeys in ""Planet of the Apes"" did a great job.Even through the more labored, musically constipated scenes (Mann must have realized this couldn't be a success and tried to compensate by drowning some of it out with blues music of the period) are boring to the point of exhaustion--Ali running, Ali on the bus, Ali hearing that famous expression actually invented by him in Zaire (""Ali, bumaye!"") to the point where we want to tell the Africans to shut up--there's an honesty to this movie that took courage.Mann does not cover up the warts of his subject.  Ali as womanizer, a confused young man who could be cruel at times, a man driven largely by unconscious impulses, all the unpleasant aspects of this enigmatic figure are here for everyone to see.  There is no hero worship here, which is surprising.The boxing scenes are what I took serious issue with.  The gloves used by Ali and his opponents look like balloons, about 18 inches long, and the actual blows look so fake that they suggest aborted attempts at violent hugs rather than punches.  (The Jerry Quarry fight is the worst.  He just starts bleeding spontaneously after a few taps.)This does show the heroic side of Ali, however whimsical, very well.  His refusal to fight in Vietnam even at the urges of the Nation of Islam is portrayed as what it was; a heroic act with dire, irreversible consequences.  Could you see Michael Jordan or Barry Bonds doing that if it meant losing money?  Probably not.  The courtroom scenes and Ali's stoic refusal to submit show the spiritual side of this gigantic and ill-fated man.Personally, I was glad that Mann stopped with Ali's last moment of real magic, the knockout of the ferocious George Foreman.  I wouldn't doubt that this is what Ali wanted and I wouldn't want to seem them stuff Smith's cheeks and making him look like the cadaverous shell of himself that he was getting beaten on by bums like Trevor Berbick.This is worth watching as a primer on Ali's life and an exciting movie.",3,An interesting biopic not to be taken too seriously,1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,3007,"['Mann', 'Ali', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'means', 'cinematic', 'car', 'crash', 'expected', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'either', 'People', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'actually', 'involved', 'Ali', 'life', 'Larry', 'Holmes', 'Joe', 'Frazier', 'have', 'ripped', 'movie', 'pieces', 'critics', 'have', 'ridiculed', 'mercilessly.A', 'lot', 'movies', 'national', 'icons', 'fail', 'simply', 'tackle', 'figures', 'are', 'larger', 'can', 'be', 'captured', 'medium', 'film', 'Hoffa', 'Doors', 'etc', 'undeniably', 'one', 'one', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'ones', 'though.Mario', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'best', 'think', 'pretty', 'well', 'playing', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'abandonment', 'Ali', 'shown', 'very', 'clearly', 'film.Will', 'Smith', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'playing', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'strange', 'childlike', 'Southern', 'tough', 'guy', 'voice', 'damn', 'perfectly', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'just', 'covered', 'makeup', 'Cosell', 'unrecognizable', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffocate', 'give', 'credit', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'meaningless', 'saying', 'one', 'monkeys', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'did', 'great', 'job.Even', 'more', 'labored', 'musically', 'constipated', 'scenes', 'Mann', 'must', 'have', 'realized', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'success', 'tried', 'compensate', 'drowning', 'out', 'blues', 'music', 'period', 'are', 'boring', 'point', 'exhaustion', 'Ali', 'running', 'Ali', 'bus', 'Ali', 'hearing', 'famous', 'expression', 'actually', 'invented', 'Zaire', 'Ali', 'bumaye', 'point', 'where', 'want', 'tell', 'Africans', 'shut', 'up', 'honesty', 'movie', 'took', 'courage.Mann', 'not', 'cover', 'up', 'warts', 'subject', 'Ali', 'womanizer', 'confused', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'cruel', 'times', 'man', 'driven', 'largely', 'unconscious', 'impulses', 'unpleasant', 'aspects', 'enigmatic', 'figure', 'are', 'here', 'everyone', 'see', 'hero', 'worship', 'here', 'surprising.The', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'are', 'what', 'took', 'serious', 'issue', 'gloves', 'used', 'Ali', 'opponents', 'look', 'balloons', 'about', '18', 'inches', 'long', 'actual', 'blows', 'look', 'so', 'fake', 'suggest', 'aborted', 'attempts', 'violent', 'hugs', 'rather', 'punches', 'Jerry', 'Quarry', 'fight', 'worst', 'just', 'bleeding', 'spontaneously', 'few', 'taps', 'show', 'heroic', 'side', 'Ali', 'however', 'whimsical', 'very', 'well', 'refusal', 'fight', 'Vietnam', 'even', 'urges', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'portrayed', 'what', 'was', 'heroic', 'act', 'dire', 'irreversible', 'consequences', 'Could', 'see', 'Michael', 'Jordan', 'Barry', 'Bonds', 'doing', 'meant', 'losing', 'money', 'Probably', 'not', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'Ali', 'stoic', 'refusal', 'submit', 'show', 'spiritual', 'side', 'gigantic', 'ill-fated', 'man.Personally', 'was', 'glad', 'Mann', 'stopped', 'Ali', 'last', 'moment', 'real', 'magic', 'knockout', 'ferocious', 'George', 'Foreman', 'would', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'what', 'Ali', 'wanted', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'seem', 'stuff', 'Smith', 'cheeks', 'making', 'look', 'cadaverous', 'shell', 'was', 'getting', 'beaten', 'bums', 'Trevor', 'Berbick.This', 'worth', 'watching', 'primer', 'Ali', 'life', 'exciting', 'movie']",Ali

Cassius (Will Smith) is young, fast and strong but most of all cocky.  He even taunts the champion of the world at the weigh in.  Sonny Liston is mad and wants to teach him a lesson.The movie shows the budding relationship between Cassius and Howard Cosell (John Voight).  Before the fight, Clay is calm and collected in the locker room.  You could have heard a pin drop as his focus is so intense.  He wants to show the world that he is the champion of a new generation of boxers.  The bookies say it will not last one round and Liston will win by KO.  Clay dances and floats and Liston can't even hardly touch him.  Clay warms up and they continue fighting after the bell ends the round.Liston is the aggressor but Clay dances and begins to wear the champ out.  Clays' speed and accuracy with his punches begin to take a toll.  It is implied that Liston has something put onto his gloves and he rubs it into Clays' eyes.  Clay can't see and they tell him to get onto his bicycle. Clay is hurting as he can't see to fight and he is really struggling.  Clays' vision clears and his determination to be the champ brings him back into the fight.....And so begins the saga of one of the most famous American athletes in modern times.  The movie covers Ali's life from his fighting career, his conversion to Islam and he changes his name to Mohammad Ali.  This is a great movie and Will Smith did a fabulous job portraying Ali but the film is just too long.

While he doesn't look too much like Ali, Will Smith bulked up and did a credible job in the ring as Ali (isn't film wonderful?).  Where Will Smith really shone was outside the ring, getting to perform as Ali the man.  It is in the human portrayal of Muhammad Ali that Will Smith disappears and we can believe that it truly is Ali himself.Ali was directed by Michael Mann (The Insider, The Last of the Mohicans) and the movie has a slow, deliberate pacing that perfectly serves the film.  We get to savor the moments on screen instead of being rushed to the next bit of Ali spitting out beautiful dialogue in rhyme.  While it is equally as important to have Ali talking as it is to have him fighting, the scenes that linger a moment or two longer than one might expect help give the overall tone to the film.  The perfect example of this is the scene where Ali is dancing with the woman who would become his first wife.  The scene is perfectly captured, slowly dancing to the music and it really puts the emotion into the scene.  Holding the shot longer helped the scene and the movie.The movie begins with young Cassius Clay preparing to fight Sonny Liston for the first time and for the championship.  The film follows his life and career through Ali winning the championship, marriages (plural), changing his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali, refusing the draft, the Ali-Frazier fight, and finally ends with the Rumble in the Jungle against George Foreman.I don't know very much about the life of Muhammad Ali, so I can't comment on the accuracy of the film.

The film spans the period from 1964, when Ali took the heavyweight boxing crown from Sonny Liston, to 1974 when he won it back from George Foreman. In between, Muhammad engineers a name change (from Cassius Clay), runs through a couple of wives, contests a draft evasion conviction with the U.S. Justice Department all the way to the Supreme Court, becomes pals with Howard Cosell, has an on and off relationship with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, and loudly proclaims himself as The Greatest to whomever will listen. All of these events are part of the public record.Ali is arguably the greatest heavyweight boxer the United States has produced. He was loud and obnoxious, but he did (and still does) have class. Unfortunately, his great career, and the Champ himself, are shortchanged by ALI. Rather than being a seamless visual and dramatic narrative, the film is a series of snapshots disjointedly strung together with too much emphasis on some people and events, and not enough on others. This film is badly in need of some serious editing. As examples, Malcolm X and much of the Zaire pre-Rumble sojourn should have been left on the cutting room floor (or, in this age of digital editing, in the computer's Recycle Bin). Moreover, the screenwriters didn't take the time to sufficiently introduce the audience to some of the characters, and at several points I mentally asked, ""Who are those people?"" And, in a bigger lapse, those same screenwriters don't allow us a perception of Ali the man that goes much deeper than his surface bombast and popular charisma. I'm left knowing (and caring) more about the fictional character of Stallone's Rocky Balboa than the real-life Ali. (Honey, you haven't given my ROCKY  I, II, III, and IV tapes to Goodwill, have you? I want to see them all again.)Despite its major flaws, the film does incorporate two acting performances of note. First of all, there's Smith's. While it may not be good enough to merit this year's Academy Award for Best Male Actor, Will should justifiably be nominated at least, and this performance is his best to date. Also, Jon Voight's Howard Cosell perfectly captures the man that those of us of a certain age remember and love (or hate). In a single year, Voight has played both Cosell and FDR (in PEARL HARBOR).

When I found out ""Ali"" was going to be made, I was eager to see it from the first moment. After watching it yesterday, I was a little disappointed.First of all, ""Ali"" covers only ten years of Muhammad's life. Sure, those were the ""best"" ten years in Ali's life, when he was at the top of his boxing career, when he converted to muslim religion, when he was a friend of Malcolm X's. But certainly, Ali's life is much more than that. Even if the movie is longer than 150 minutes, I was, at the end, feeling that there was something missing (and there really was). Another low point of the movie is Michael Mann's direction. After ""Heat"" and ""The insider"" (two movies I really enjoyed), he changed his style, and Ali's was a blend of Steven Soderbergh and Oliver Stone. Maybe Mann wanted his movie to be like a documentary, but that was not the point in ""Ali"" (there is already a tremendous documentary about Ali, called ""When we were kings"").Now, the good parts: the producers worked hard and found actors that really resemble the fighters, specially George Foreman. Will Smith does not resemble Ali, but Smith does a competent job as the protagonist. Aside from his good acting, his leg and feet movements are impressibly close to what Ali did in the ring. I also have to mention Mario van Peebles as Malcolm X, Mykelti Williamson as Don King (funny) and John Voight as sports-anchor Howard Cosell. But the main award should go to Jamie Foxx as Ali's drug-addicted, priest-like jew companion Bundini Brown. Great performance.Anyway, Ali was not what I expected.

Bernabo,"[2, 3]","The ad campaign for ""Ali"" focused on Will Smith's Oscar nominated portrayal of Muhammed Ali, but in the end I found this to really be director Michael Mann's film. Like ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" this is also a film where the leading man looks intently while the music surges. Mann has always been enamored of letting music carry a moment (first evidenced by his use of ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" for the climatic scene of ""Manhunter"") and ""Ali"" is certainly no exception. The film begins with a montage of Cassius Clay out running as part of his training for his first title fight with Sonny Liston mixed with images of formative influences on Clay growing up and Sam Cooke (David Elliott) performing in a Harlem nightclub. Unfortunately, the film never reaches this high initial peak again during the rest of the film.""Ali"" is not a traditional biopic in that those who know little about the champ's life are not going to understand what is going on. The strategy of mouthing off at every opportunity to convince Liston that the young Cassius Clay was psychotic or the ""rope a dope"" tactic that Ali used to defeat George Foreman (Charles Shufford), are implicit at best. In this regard the film clearly works better with those who know enough of Ali's life to fill in the pieces (the scene where Ali ane Joe Frazier (James Toney) drive around in a car together planning their first fight was one of the film's few revelations for me). Mann creates something of a patterned mosaic, where there are fights, women, and interviews with Howard Cosell (Jon Voight), while Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) and Martin Luther King, Jr. are gunned down. What cuts through this is Ali's refusal to be drafted into the Army to go and fight in Vietnam. At the end of the film as Ali trains for the ""Rumble in Jungle"" his run through the streets of Zaire reprises the opening but the repetition rings hollow.There are scenes where Smith gets to spout off some of Ali's wonderful rants, but it is clearly established that this is not the ""real"" Ali. The moments in the film when we think we glimpse the real man are, paradoxically, not those in which he is talking but those in which he is quiet, his eyes taking in the world around him and leaving it to us to figure out what is going on in his mind. If there is any moment in the film where Ali is laid bared it is when he is punishing Ernie Terrell (Alfred Cole) for having called him Clay: Ali refuses to finish his opponent off, hitting Terrell again and again, repeatedly shouting ""What's my name?""I also want to take Mann to task for having reduced the first fight with Frazier to the end of the fight, choosing to omit the shocking image of Ali on the canvas, wearing those shoes with the tassels. Especially since this is a film that takes the time to give the audience a sense in the final fight of how long Ali let Foreman pound on him against the ropes, waiting for the right moment. Fortunately, a lot of the film's faults are covered by Smith's performance, which has been deservedly praised for avoiding the pitfalls of caricature.

588843,A3K5IMGDCDBCNF,B00005JKMQ,"""lecorel@hotmail.com""","[0, 0]","Let me make a suggestion to people who are about to go see Ali.  When you come out of the theater ask yourself one question:  Did you get the message?  Because you might be asking yourself one of any number of questions about what you just saw.  You might not be sure it was any good. Is this movie disjointed, sort of, is it hard to follow, in some places, does it skip around, absolutely.  The reason you have to ask yourself if you got the message is because if you did then you probably thought it was a good film.The film basically covers the years between when Ali, then know as Cassus Clay, won the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston to when he won it again from George Foreman, about a ten year span.  And this span is when Ali was at the height of his fame.  The details are not as important as how they are presented in this film.  Since it is a docudrama everyone already knows what happened, but seen from the perspective of Ali, some of his choices seem to have been made for different reasons then were originally perceived.  Again there is no reason to go into them, but it makes this film much more interesting then if they had played it safe.  The movie is engaging from start to finish.The best part about this movie is (to my surprise) Will Smith.  He did it.  I was totally cinvinced from the first scene in this film, he is Ali.  The swagger, the jive, the sincerity, he even looked like a prize fighter, he did it all.  The supporting players in this film, with a big high five to Jon Voight, are quite exceptional, despite slipping into the backround at many points in the film.  The look of the film was fantastic, and the boxing scenes were extremely well done.Taking on a docudrama on a figure like Ali is one of the most difficult tasks a filmmaker can tackle.  This is because Ali is a living legend, and one of the most prominent sports figures in the twentith century.  His story is way too large for a movie so Michael Mann had an important issue confronting him.  What should this film be about?  His answer is not what the average person, and certainly not the average filmmaker might think.  He decided it should not be about anything, but capturing the essence of this almost mythical figure.  Did he do it?  I think so. Because I think I got the message.  Ali was a man heavily pushed and pulled out during a time of great turmoil in this country, but through it all he never compromised himself or his beliefs no matter what the consiquence.  I got that and that made this movie worth seeing to me.",4,The Greatest,1009497600,"12 28, 2001",2001,2536,"['Let', 'make', 'suggestion', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'go', 'see', 'Ali', 'When', 'come', 'theater', 'ask', 'one', 'question', 'Did', 'get', 'message', 'might', 'be', 'asking', 'one', 'number', 'questions', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'sure', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'disjointed', 'sort', 'hard', 'follow', 'places', 'skip', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'have', 'ask', 'got', 'message', 'did', 'then', 'probably', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'film.The', 'film', 'basically', 'years', 'when', 'Ali', 'then', 'know', 'Cassus', 'Clay', 'won', 'heavyweight', 'title', 'Sonny', 'Liston', 'when', 'won', 'again', 'George', 'Foreman', 'ten', 'year', 'span', 'span', 'when', 'Ali', 'was', 'height', 'fame', 'details', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'important', 'how', 'are', 'presented', 'film', 'docudrama', 'everyone', 'already', 'what', 'happened', 'seen', 'perspective', 'Ali', 'choices', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'different', 'reasons', 'then', 'were', 'originally', 'perceived', 'Again', 'reason', 'go', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'then', 'had', 'played', 'safe', 'movie', 'engaging', 'start', 'finish.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'surprise', 'Will', 'Smith', 'did', 'was', 'totally', 'cinvinced', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'Ali', 'swagger', 'jive', 'sincerity', 'even', 'looked', 'prize', 'fighter', 'did', 'supporting', 'players', 'film', 'big', 'high', 'five', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'are', 'quite', 'exceptional', 'slipping', 'backround', 'many', 'points', 'film', 'look', 'film', 'was', 'fantastic', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'were', 'extremely', 'well', 'done.Taking', 'docudrama', 'figure', 'Ali', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'tasks', 'filmmaker', 'can', 'tackle', 'Ali', 'living', 'legend', 'one', 'most', 'prominent', 'sports', 'figures', 'twentith', 'century', 'story', 'way', 'too', 'large', 'movie', 'so', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'had', 'important', 'issue', 'confronting', 'What', 'should', 'film', 'be', 'answer', 'not', 'what', 'average', 'person', 'certainly', 'not', 'average', 'filmmaker', 'might', 'think', 'decided', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'anything', 'capturing', 'essence', 'almost', 'mythical', 'figure', 'Did', 'do', 'think', 'so', 'think', 'got', 'message', 'Ali', 'was', 'man', 'heavily', 'pushed', 'pulled', 'out', 'time', 'great', 'turmoil', 'country', 'never', 'compromised', 'beliefs', 'matter', 'what', 'consiquence', 'got', 'made', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing']",Ali
588844,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JKMQ,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 2]","Starring Will Smith as Mohammad Ali, this film tries to do a lot. It especially answers the question as to why Ali has become such a famous American personality. Ali was unique in challenging some strong preconceived notions of what was appropriate for a world champion.  And his relationship with Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam made him extremely controversial.  He was a braggart, full of ego and not a very likeable person. But, after all, he was a boxer.  And this is all part of the game.There are a lot of fighting sequences in the film.  They're shot from a wide variety of angles, including close-ups of gloves or shoulders or feet.  It gives the impression of being right there in the ring and part of the action and I found myself wincing at the blows.  I couldn't always tell who was hitting who however, and perhaps that was the director's intent.  These were over-long in spite of the realism.I enjoyed the parts or the film which explained Ali's conversion to Islam. And I was glad the film didn't pull any punches about the politics of how he was banned and then re-instated into the religion.  Will Smith did a competent job as Ali, but it was rare when his face could register a significant range of emotion.  More successful was Jamie Foxx, cast as one of Ali's trainers.  He was the center of every scene he was in. Jon Voight played the late Howard Cosell and his scenes with Ali were excellent.  The three women in Ali's life, played by Nona Gay, Jada Pinkett Smith and Michel Michele all managed to put their own personalities into small roles that could have easily been stereotyped.The Mohamed Ali depicted in this film is somewhat of a hero.  I can't say personally whether or not this is true.  But the film is enjoyable to watch and moved quickly through its 2 hours and 38 minutes.  It did need smoother transitions between episodes however.  And I would have liked to know more about Ali's Islamic faith.  Also, there was certain sameness to all of Ali's opponents.  Perhaps the fact that all these questions surfaced in my own mind about Ali and his career is one of the strengths of the film. It left me yearning to know more.  I give this film a mild recommendation as an introduction to the world of Mohammed Ali.",4,Ali's career was  unique and controversial,1021680000,"05 18, 2002",2002,2249,"['Starring', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Mohammad', 'Ali', 'film', 'do', 'lot', 'especially', 'question', 'why', 'Ali', 'become', 'famous', 'American', 'personality', 'Ali', 'was', 'unique', 'challenging', 'strong', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'what', 'was', 'appropriate', 'world', 'champion', 'relationship', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'made', 'extremely', 'controversial', 'was', 'braggart', 'full', 'ego', 'not', 'very', 'likeable', 'person', 'was', 'boxer', 'part', 'game.There', 'are', 'lot', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'film', ""'re"", 'shot', 'wide', 'variety', 'angles', 'including', 'close-ups', 'gloves', 'shoulders', 'feet', 'impression', 'being', 'right', 'there', 'ring', 'part', 'action', 'found', 'wincing', 'blows', 'could', ""n't"", 'always', 'tell', 'who', 'was', 'hitting', 'who', 'however', 'perhaps', 'was', 'director', 'intent', 'were', 'over-long', 'spite', 'realism.I', 'enjoyed', 'parts', 'film', 'explained', 'Ali', 'conversion', 'Islam', 'was', 'glad', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'politics', 'how', 'was', 'banned', 'then', 're-instated', 'religion', 'Will', 'Smith', 'did', 'competent', 'job', 'Ali', 'was', 'rare', 'when', 'face', 'could', 'register', 'significant', 'range', 'emotion', 'More', 'successful', 'was', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'cast', 'one', 'Ali', 'trainers', 'was', 'center', 'scene', 'was', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'played', 'late', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'scenes', 'Ali', 'were', 'excellent', 'three', 'women', 'Ali', 'life', 'played', 'Nona', 'Gay', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'Michel', 'Michele', 'all', 'managed', 'put', 'own', 'personalities', 'small', 'roles', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'stereotyped.The', 'Mohamed', 'Ali', 'depicted', 'film', 'somewhat', 'hero', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'personally', 'not', 'true', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'moved', 'quickly', '2', 'hours', '38', 'minutes', 'did', 'need', 'smoother', 'transitions', 'episodes', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'know', 'more', 'Ali', 'Islamic', 'faith', 'Also', 'was', 'certain', 'sameness', 'Ali', 'opponents', 'Perhaps', 'fact', 'questions', 'surfaced', 'own', 'mind', 'Ali', 'career', 'one', 'strengths', 'film', 'left', 'yearning', 'know', 'more', 'give', 'film', 'mild', 'recommendation', 'introduction', 'world', 'Mohammed', 'Ali']",Ali

Quido ""quidrock""","[10, 11]","I never thought it possible, but the unfortunate length (157 minutes) and the pacing of Michael Mann's film bogs down the story of a sports icon who may never be matched in the sheer amount of charisma he possessed.  I'm a big fan of Michael Mann's - from the Miami Vice days to Last of the Mohicans to The Insider.  His visual and sound vision were clearly present in this film, and his script and the caliber of his stars clearly produced some fine individual moments and some excellent performances.  But, in trying to cover too much ground, Mann never clearly establishes a compelling single story line, and doesn't spend enough time revealing the connection (pro and con) between Ali and the American public.  Ali always kept you guessing.  Was it real, or was it Ali performing for the cameras?As much as I enjoyed the boxing scenes, they probably did the most to drag the movie out too long....and I would have preferred more Liston and Frazier, and done Foreman only anecdotally.  The same with his marriages....more anecdotally, since none of the relationships was really allowed to evolve on film (although it would have been a shame to miss Nona Gay, as wife Belinda; she was superb). Individual performances were striking, with Jon Voight in a career caricature as Howard Cosell, a tremendous performance by Jamie Foxx as Bundini, and brief but memorable cameos by Ron Silver and Giancarlo Esposito.  And Will Smith?  This was a really fine performance in a role that would have scared many actors.  He truly studied his role and exacted everything he was capable of in the film.  Was it worth an Academy Award nomination - I think not, but I now believe he's capable of making a real run for it in a future role.Pound for pound, I preferred ""The Hurricane"".",3,How could Muhammed Ali ever be tedious?,1024531200,"06 20, 2002",2002,1770,"['never', 'thought', 'possible', 'unfortunate', 'length', '157', 'minutes', 'pacing', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'film', 'bogs', 'down', 'story', 'sports', 'icon', 'who', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'matched', 'sheer', 'amount', 'charisma', 'possessed', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'days', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Insider', 'visual', 'sound', 'vision', 'were', 'clearly', 'present', 'film', 'script', 'caliber', 'stars', 'clearly', 'produced', 'fine', 'individual', 'moments', 'excellent', 'performances', 'trying', 'cover', 'too', 'much', 'ground', 'Mann', 'never', 'clearly', 'compelling', 'single', 'story', 'line', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'revealing', 'connection', 'pro', 'con', 'Ali', 'American', 'public', 'Ali', 'always', 'kept', 'guessing', 'Was', 'real', 'was', 'Ali', 'performing', 'cameras', 'As', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'probably', 'did', 'most', 'drag', 'movie', 'too', 'long', '.and', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'Liston', 'Frazier', 'done', 'Foreman', 'only', 'anecdotally', 'same', 'marriages', '.more', 'anecdotally', 'none', 'relationships', 'was', 'really', 'allowed', 'evolve', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shame', 'miss', 'Nona', 'Gay', 'wife', 'Belinda', 'was', 'superb', 'Individual', 'performances', 'were', 'striking', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'career', 'caricature', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Bundini', 'brief', 'memorable', 'cameos', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'Will', 'Smith', 'was', 'really', 'fine', 'performance', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'scared', 'many', 'actors', 'truly', 'studied', 'role', 'exacted', 'everything', 'was', 'capable', 'film', 'Was', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'think', 'not', 'now', 'believe', 'capable', 'making', 'real', 'run', 'future', 'role.Pound', 'pound', 'preferred', 'Hurricane']",Ali

588849,A2NGF128HTRD39,B00005JKMQ,Matt,"[0, 0]","...Michael Mann's stirring adaptation of the Muhammad Ali saga is all common fallacy of appeal to force and circular reasoning.  It ponders the all-too familiar cons of the struggling boxer, who is of course waiting to make it to the top (The Hurricane, Rocky).  ""Ali"", despite its truthful references, is a grip-n-go satire of relationship, violence, and sports, ultimately leading up to the Final Fight of victory when Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali faces big-boy George in the ring.The purpose of bringing up circular reasoning and appeal-to-force with ""Ali"", is that the movie is focused more on the immitations and recreations of Ali's struggles and preparation for the fights.  It presents well when Will Smith is voicing the champ and portraying the right actions.  Other than the facial tissue, we are left with a brick wall.  Where is the emotion?  Where is the greatful side?  Where is the smile?  There are many installments of Ali's womanizing complications, his Muslim road of life, his neglection, and even his courtroom detour of possible imprisonment after refusal of fighting in the Vietnam War; great- but why is everything about his major struggles?  Weren't there issues in his time where he would sit back and smile because of them?  ""Ali"" never gives us a proven example, and the film forces us to withstand the vision of Michael Mann and the band of screenwriters that produced this biopic sling-shot.Will Smith is the real champ here, doing his duties as an actor- making a legendary performance as Muhammad Ali.  His words, his movements, his feel are all on the mark.  The mere fact that his participating in this film deserves well praise alone will sustain his career for at least five years.  His Oscar nomination was no surprise and was well deserved.  He drives this drama where otherwise it could not have gone.  However, this just isn't the right movie.  This isn't ""Ali"".  This is an exterior figure of Ali ""The Champ"".  Where is the interior substance?Jada Pinkett-Smith, Oscar Nominee- Jon Voight, and Jamie Foxx also co-star.  Voight also received an Academy Award Nomination for his supporting performance as Howard Cosell- one I think was uncalled for.  His face is pure plastic and make-up.  His texture works for the film, but it isn't anything magnificent.  If this is the case, I'd rather give Voight an Oscar for his supporting performance as President Roosevelt in ""Pearl Harbor"", where is face was again revised to reveal a stunning image of old Franklin.To give ""Ali"" the benefit of the doubt, I will say that Will Smith and many cast members worked marvelously.  It isn't the faults of the stars.  It is the story that is corrupted with elongated sequences of boredom and neglection, overrunning the fact that is traveling too far, and yet not getting deep enough.

But what we may have forgotten is that Mohammed Ali was first and foremost an honorable and brave man, though flawed and human like the rest of us.Who among us would go up against the United States Government and the Draft Board by refusing to serve in a war in which he did not believe; thereby risking 5 years in Federal Prison, losing 3 years of his prime boxing life and subsequent lost earnings...and all out of deeply felt religious and humanitarian reasons. Ali's boxing life notwithstanding, this is ultimately the importance and the relevance of Mann's &quot;Ali,&quot; which is not so much a boxing film in the sense that &quot;Raging Bull&quot; is, but a film about a Champion and the machinations, perserverance, personality, drive and more importantly the sacrifices necessary to achieve this exalted professional position.Michael Mann has given the film an appropriate grainy, almost newsreel look which emphasizes the sweaty, muscular milieu he is trying to portray.  But I think Mann's touch is most apparent in the performance of Will Smith as Mohammed Ali. I was extremely skeptical that Smith, heretofore a light comedian/rapper, could handle the emotional weight of such a role. I was wrong. Smith gives a towering,eloquent performance filled with the requisite heart and soul as well as the necessary bragadaccio necessary to pull off this portrayal of one of the most famous people of the the 20th century.In supporting roles, Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, Jamie Fox as Drew Brown and Ron Silver as Angelo Dundee all do excellent work in roles that not only support Smith/Ali but do so with a kind of truth not often seen on the screen.&quot;Ali&quot; runs into the most trouble, I think when it attempts too much: the Jada Pinkett-Smith as Sonji Roy, Ali's first wife storyline simply doesn't make sense as well as the Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) storyline: very powerfully enacted but motivationally murky here as well.Michael Mann and Will Smith have done a bang-up job capturing Mohammed Ali's tumultuous life on film and I will not hestitate to speculate that the Man himself cannot help but be complimented by the results.",4,Lonely Are The Brave,1009497600,"12 28, 2001",2001,2362,"['years', 'hyperbole', 'marriages', 'knockouts', 'championship', 'lost', 'won', 'regained', 'there', 'center', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'quot', 'Ali', 'quot', 'man', 'Mohammed', 'Ali', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'forgotten', 'Mohammed', 'Ali', 'was', 'first', 'foremost', 'honorable', 'brave', 'man', 'flawed', 'human', 'rest', 'us.Who', 'would', 'go', 'up', 'United', 'States', 'Government', 'Draft', 'Board', 'refusing', 'serve', 'war', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'thereby', 'risking', '5', 'years', 'Federal', 'Prison', 'losing', '3', 'years', 'prime', 'boxing', 'life', 'subsequent', 'lost', 'earnings', 'deeply', 'felt', 'religious', 'humanitarian', 'reasons', 'Ali', 'boxing', 'life', 'notwithstanding', 'ultimately', 'importance', 'relevance', 'Mann', 'quot', 'Ali', 'quot', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'boxing', 'film', 'sense', 'quot', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'quot', 'film', 'Champion', 'machinations', 'perserverance', 'personality', 'drive', 'more', 'importantly', 'sacrifices', 'necessary', 'achieve', 'exalted', 'professional', 'position.Michael', 'Mann', 'given', 'film', 'appropriate', 'grainy', 'almost', 'look', 'sweaty', 'muscular', 'milieu', 'trying', 'portray', 'think', 'Mann', 'touch', 'most', 'apparent', 'performance', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Mohammed', 'Ali', 'was', 'extremely', 'skeptical', 'Smith', 'heretofore', 'light', 'comedian/rapper', 'could', 'handle', 'emotional', 'weight', 'such', 'role', 'was', 'wrong', 'Smith', 'towering', 'eloquent', 'performance', 'filled', 'requisite', 'heart', 'soul', 'as', 'well', 'necessary', 'bragadaccio', 'necessary', 'pull', 'off', 'portrayal', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'people', '20th', 'century.In', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'Jamie', 'Fox', 'Drew', 'Brown', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Angelo', 'Dundee', 'do', 'excellent', 'work', 'roles', 'not', 'only', 'support', 'Smith/Ali', 'do', 'so', 'kind', 'truth', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'screen.', 'quot', 'Ali', 'quot', 'most', 'trouble', 'think', 'when', 'too', 'much', 'Jada', 'Pinkett-Smith', 'Sonji', 'Roy', 'Ali', 'first', 'wife', 'storyline', 'simply', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'as', 'well', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Mario', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'storyline', 'very', 'powerfully', 'enacted', 'motivationally', 'murky', 'here', 'well.Michael', 'Mann', 'Will', 'Smith', 'have', 'done', 'bang-up', 'job', 'capturing', 'Mohammed', 'Ali', 'tumultuous', 'life', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'hestitate', 'speculate', 'Man', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'complimented', 'results']",Ali
588851,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B00005JKMQ,Michael J. Mazza,"[5, 7]","Overall I was impressed with ""Ali,"" the biopic of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali. Director Michael Mann brings to vivid life many episodes from the life of the man formerly known as Cassius Clay. However, for me these episodes did not add up fully; I felt like the film did not attain the true epic stature it aspired to.Nonetheless, ""Ali"" is a compelling and entertaining film that combines superb production details, a fine cast, and other noteworthy elements. Will Smith and Jon Voight have both earned much rightful praise for their respective performances as Ali and sportscaster Howard Cosell. Smith will, in my opinion, never again be seen merely as an actor for ""popcorn"" flicks: in Ali we see the triumphant breakthrough performance of a dramatic leading man. Voight's total transformation into Cosell is amazing; if I didn't know beforehand that he was playing the role, I don't think I would have recognized him. Although Smith and Voight seem to have gotten most of the praise (and award nominations!), I would like to personally celebrate Mario Van Peebles for his portrayal of Malcolm X. I found his to be a very moving performance.Perhaps Ali's life is simply too big to fit into a movie; maybe an extended miniseries would have made a better vehicle by which to tell his story. As a student of comparative religion, I felt in particular that the story of Ali's Islamic faith was not explored enough.

Mr. Mann shifts gears appropriately from his heavy action yarns (Thief, Last of the Mohicans, Heat) to provide an insightful look into the life of this legendary boxer as Will Smith pulls off the title role rather well yet regrettably holds back much of the wit, humor and unpredictable antics Ali was known for. As a result, viewer's eyes actually will be more fixated on the dynamite supporting cast including Ron Silver as Ali's longtime trainer Angelo Dundee and Mario Van Peebles playing a formidable Malcolm X. Both of these memorable characters are only to be outdone by an almost unrecognizable Jon Voight as he dons the patented yellow ABC sport jacket and gives an incredible, Oscar nominated performance as the exuberant and controversial Howard Cosell who always seemed to be where Ali roamed the globe.

588854,AR22YY31EO2QT,B00005JKMQ,"M. M ""M M""","[0, 10]","I went in wanting it like this movie, I really did. For the record, I'm a white woman, and I really like the ""Rocky"" films. Having been assaulted by my former partner, I knew exactly how Stallone's character felt when he said ""the next morning's the worst,' and I can sure attest to that. I watched all six movies while locked into a hyperbaric chamber twenty times over the course of a month, from the metabolic holes in my head from the abuse on SPECT scan.., a very expensive month, too, since insurance paid for NONE of it. Which was well over 7,500. And I have good insurance! I was landed on my head by my hair onto a tile floor. You can see in the SPECTs right where I hit the floor. In answer to your question, no, they do the 'nice guy bit' until they think they have you, and then they start to turn on you in what starts out looking like 'just a bad day.'No abusive man goes out with a woman he wants to impress and calls here a horrible name at dinner on their first date, and slaps her in the face, it's more like the frog boiling to death in the gradually heated water. A frog won't sit in boiling water, he jumps out!So, my personal experience correlates to the humble, nice guy in a bad spot--ie Rocky. Who if you'll notice gets his butt kicked by bigger and bigger guys in each film. I could relate to that, also. I can't stand arrogance, ""I'm the greatest"" never fails to bother me. Because it's naive, someone, especially in sports, will eventually win out over you. I didn't like this character. Arrogance doesn't seem to be a Muslim value, is it? Note in the second Rocky movie, Paulie suggests that if Adrian was acting up, knock her teeth out. Rocky says, ""Well, you know I kinda like her teeth where they are.' You never specifically hear an anti domestic abuse message in the movies.I dislike movies where the sex is gratuitous, namely because it gives people the idea that you can use people and have no consequences, when that's not at all the case. I don't like when women are like Kleenex, disposable and replaceable. I got that from the trailer alone, and I wasn't looking forward to the movie for that.Even in the later films when Rocky did the 'homeboy' thing, which struck me as odd, considering he's a white boy, and it's bizarrely out of place on someone who had to be 45 at the time of the movie. I put up with it, because there were some nice scenes, even as far gone as ""Rocky Balboa,' the scenes where they do the Adrian tour, and that he didn't just hop into bed with that girl. even the meat locker scene about the 'stuff in the basement' was interesting.Part of why the character was an icon is because he gave a lot of people someone to emulate, and to look up to, which you sure don't get here. I wish you did. I was sincerely hoping for it. Remember, the original film was in 1976, when I was small, and the country needed someone to have as their hero.  Vietnam was just wrapping up, the muscle cars were pretty much gone, a casualty of combined astronomical gas prices, and insurance. We didn't have a heck of a lot to look forward to as a country.I wish this could have given us another icon or character to emulate and admire.I love the Rocky films because I was sincerely hoping for that here, a sincere, honest man, just trying to do his best, who loved his wife sincerely, wasn't treating her like a stray dog you can kick as you choose (and I love dogs)  and wasn't cheating on her with every woman in sight, full of skeeze we don't really need to see. He couldn't even beat guys up as a 'collector.' Frankly, I hope we get a chance to someday see another character like that again. But then, it's only been 36 years!  Also, Burgess Meredeth was brilliant as the old trainer.I only had those hope for this movie. I'm sorry I was disappointed.",1,where is zero stars?,1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,3795,"['went', 'wanting', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'record', ""'m"", 'white', 'woman', 'really', 'Rocky', 'films', 'Having', 'been', 'assaulted', 'former', 'partner', 'knew', 'exactly', 'how', 'Stallone', 'character', 'felt', 'when', 'said', 'next', 'morning', 'worst', 'can', 'sure', 'attest', 'watched', 'six', 'movies', 'locked', 'hyperbaric', 'chamber', 'twenty', 'times', 'course', 'month', 'metabolic', 'holes', 'head', 'abuse', 'SPECT', 'scan..', 'very', 'expensive', 'month', 'too', 'insurance', 'paid', 'NONE', 'Which', 'was', 'well', '7,500', 'have', 'good', 'insurance', 'was', 'landed', 'head', 'hair', 'tile', 'floor', 'can', 'see', 'SPECTs', 'right', 'where', 'hit', 'floor', 'answer', 'question', 'do', ""'nice"", 'guy', 'bit', 'think', 'have', 'then', 'start', 'turn', 'what', 'out', 'looking', 'bad', 'day', 'abusive', 'man', 'out', 'woman', 'impress', 'here', 'horrible', 'name', 'dinner', 'first', 'date', 'face', 'more', 'frog', 'boiling', 'death', 'gradually', 'heated', 'water', 'frog', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sit', 'boiling', 'water', 'out', 'So', 'personal', 'experience', 'correlates', 'humble', 'nice', 'guy', 'bad', 'spot', 'ie', 'Rocky', 'Who', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'butt', 'kicked', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'guys', 'film', 'could', 'relate', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'arrogance', ""'m"", 'greatest', 'never', 'bother', 'naive', 'someone', 'especially', 'sports', 'will', 'eventually', 'win', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'character', 'Arrogance', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'Muslim', 'value', 'Note', 'second', 'Rocky', 'movie', 'Paulie', 'Adrian', 'was', 'acting', 'up', 'knock', 'teeth', 'out', 'Rocky', 'Well', 'know', 'kinda', 'teeth', 'where', 'are', 'never', 'specifically', 'hear', 'anti', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'message', 'movies.I', 'dislike', 'movies', 'where', 'sex', 'gratuitous', 'namely', 'people', 'idea', 'can', 'use', 'people', 'have', 'consequences', 'when', 'not', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'women', 'are', 'Kleenex', 'disposable', 'replaceable', 'got', 'trailer', 'alone', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'that.Even', 'later', 'films', 'when', 'Rocky', 'did', ""'homeboy"", 'thing', 'struck', 'odd', 'considering', 'white', 'boy', 'bizarrely', 'place', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'be', '45', 'time', 'movie', 'put', 'up', 'were', 'nice', 'scenes', 'even', 'far', 'gone', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'scenes', 'where', 'do', 'Adrian', 'tour', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'hop', 'bed', 'girl', 'even', 'meat', 'locker', 'scene', ""'stuff"", 'basement', 'was', 'interesting.Part', 'why', 'character', 'was', 'icon', 'gave', 'lot', 'people', 'someone', 'emulate', 'look', 'up', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'here', 'wish', 'did', 'was', 'sincerely', 'hoping', 'Remember', 'original', 'film', 'was', '1976', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'country', 'needed', 'someone', 'have', 'hero', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'just', 'wrapping', 'up', 'muscle', 'cars', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'gone', 'casualty', 'combined', 'astronomical', 'gas', 'prices', 'insurance', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'heck', 'lot', 'look', 'forward', 'country.I', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'icon', 'character', 'emulate', 'admire.I', 'love', 'Rocky', 'films', 'was', 'sincerely', 'hoping', 'here', 'sincere', 'honest', 'man', 'just', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'who', 'loved', 'wife', 'sincerely', 'was', ""n't"", 'treating', 'stray', 'dog', 'can', 'kick', 'choose', 'love', 'dogs', 'was', ""n't"", 'cheating', 'woman', 'sight', 'full', 'skeeze', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'see', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'beat', 'guys', 'up', ""'collector"", 'Frankly', 'hope', 'get', 'chance', 'someday', 'see', 'character', 'again', 'then', 'only', 'been', '36', 'years', 'Also', 'Burgess', 'Meredeth', 'was', 'brilliant', 'old', 'trainer.I', 'only', 'had', 'hope', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'was', 'disappointed']",Ali

According to Michael Mann, both versions are truly director's cuts, and this one simply emphasizes the politics a bit more. This is what a director's cut should be. A true redo of the movie, not adding in an extended scene or two to get an &quot;unrated&quot; DVD to sell more.Will Smith gives an incredibly powerful performance as Cassius Clay, aka Muhammed Ali. Mario Van Peebles does a great job as Malcom X, and Jamie Foxx is wonderful as Bundini.  The movie shows how Ali was manipulated by his management, but also how he stuck to his beliefs.Will Smith delivers the line so convincingly, it's amazingly powerful and heartfelt. Not only the lines, but Will also took real punches in the movie.

I heard about Will Smith's role in Ali so decided to watch this as well.You have to give credit to Will Smith for the accent,and the swaggering, overconfident 'Ali-ness' that he carried off so well. What interested me the most about this movie was Ali's contact with the black muslims and particularly Malcolm X. It was interesting to watch these two giants of the Civil Rights era come together in a time when the struggle for minority rights was the fiercest.Ali's struggles after he had lost his right to box made me realize the power that Government has over the people within it's territory, but it also shows how hope can overcome what appear to be insurmountable obstacles. This was the saddest part of the film, and I think it made for good drama.Despite Ali's magnificence in the boxing ring, he was a flawed man. His promiscuity makes a mockery of his religion and his weak excuses made me realize just how limited certain men are in carrying over the discipline from public life into the private.I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in the life of Muhammad Ali.",4,Great film about a legend,1081900800,"04 14, 2004",2004,1231,"['Not', 'being', 'boxing', 'fan', 'having', 'had', 'watched', 'When', 'were', 'Kings', 'had', 'rough', 'idea', 'who', 'Ali', 'was', 'what', 'had', 'achieved', 'career', 'heard', 'Will', 'Smith', 'role', 'Ali', 'so', 'decided', 'watch', 'well.You', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'Will', 'Smith', 'accent', 'swaggering', 'overconfident', ""'Ali-ness"", 'carried', 'off', 'so', 'well', 'What', 'interested', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'Ali', 'contact', 'black', 'muslims', 'particularly', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'two', 'giants', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'era', 'come', 'together', 'time', 'when', 'struggle', 'minority', 'rights', 'was', 'fiercest.Ali', 'struggles', 'had', 'lost', 'right', 'box', 'made', 'realize', 'power', 'Government', 'people', 'territory', 'also', 'how', 'hope', 'can', 'overcome', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'insurmountable', 'obstacles', 'was', 'saddest', 'part', 'film', 'think', 'made', 'good', 'drama.Despite', 'Ali', 'magnificence', 'boxing', 'ring', 'was', 'flawed', 'man', 'promiscuity', 'mockery', 'religion', 'weak', 'excuses', 'made', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'limited', 'certain', 'men', 'are', 'carrying', 'discipline', 'public', 'life', 'private.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'interested', 'life', 'Muhammad', 'Ali']",Ali
588857,A1X910WAOVYV8M,B00005JKMQ,"Nathan ""Cawntry-fried Calypso Beach Bum""","[3, 3]","I'm sorry, but I just couldn't resist that one.  I been wanting to say that ever since this movie first came out.  All jokes aside though, Will Smith really does turn in a pretty convincing performance as one of the most exciting and provocative figures in history.  The heart and passion he put into his performance is clearly evident, and that's something you just have to admire.  And I honestly wish I could base my opinion solely on his performance, so I could give the overall movie a higher rating, but, alas, a real fan or critic just can't fairly do that, so I'm forced to look at it all wich doesn't measure up unfortunately.After all the hype surrounding this movie, dating all the way back to when it was in the development process and the talk in the rumor mill of all the training that Smith was undergoing to muscle up and really tackle the role, I just had really high expectations for it.  But, the finished product is just less-than-stellar.  And most of this is due to an incredibly choppy and confusing script.  One of the big problems with the writing is that it leaves several crucial points unresolved, for example it never goes into depth about the failures of Ali's first two marriages.  Instead it breezes right by the problems and tensions as if they're just trivial little facts.  This belies another problem in this movie which is the chronological order of events.  It's not that it doesn't follow the chronological order of Ali's life, but it never lets us know EXACTLY WHERE we're at.  We're given a date of 1964 at the beginning, but after that nothing.  Are we just s'posed to figure it out for ourselves or be able to follow along well enough to know when a year goes by, two years?  And Smith doesn't really age at all over the course of the film so that makes it even more difficult.  So that aspect of it really aggravated me.  Most of the cast have good chemistry together, and a few of the supporting players actually turn in excellent work as well, particularly Jaimie Fox as ""Bundini"" Brown, and John Voight, who gave an incredibly authentic performance as Howard Cossell.  Nona Gaye's breakthrough performance as Ali's second wife Belinda, is quite admirable considering she was given very little to work with.Basically, a few re-writes in the script and maybe a different director would've suited this movie just fine.  That's not to say that Michael Mann hacked 'Ali' up for all it was worth; it's a very beautiful-looking film, using popular music from the '60s and '70s quite well to heighten the emotions of some scenes as well as give an authentic aura of the time period, but the overall feeling is style over substance.  I like Mann as a director, he's done good work in the past with movies like 'Heat' and the widely-acclaimed 'The Insider', but he just wasn't the right man for the job.The only two moments of the film which really grabbed my attention were Ali's emotional reaction upon hearing of Malcolm X's death, and the final boxing match in Zaire with George Foreman, so I'd say to at least rent the movie for those scenes alone, as well as to see some of the great performances.  Just don't expect to be totally grabbed by it all.  The DVD has basically no features, which kind of surprised me, but didn't really bother me, since I don't really care about the details of how this film was made.  All I would've cared about is maybe seeing some interviews with the real Ali, and maybe some television archives of some of his boxing matches and press conferences.  Now, don't let my dryness fool ya, this is NOT by any means a terrible movie.  It's just it could've been much, MUCH better.",2,"""And the challenger... er, um, the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air?""",1029542400,"08 17, 2002",2002,3649,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'one', 'been', 'wanting', 'say', 'ever', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'jokes', 'aside', 'Will', 'Smith', 'really', 'turn', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'performance', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'provocative', 'figures', 'history', 'heart', 'passion', 'put', 'performance', 'clearly', 'evident', 'something', 'just', 'have', 'admire', 'honestly', 'wish', 'could', 'base', 'opinion', 'solely', 'performance', 'could', 'give', 'overall', 'movie', 'higher', 'rating', 'alas', 'real', 'fan', 'critic', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fairly', 'do', ""'m"", 'forced', 'look', 'wich', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'unfortunately.After', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'dating', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'development', 'process', 'talk', 'rumor', 'mill', 'training', 'Smith', 'was', 'undergoing', 'muscle', 'up', 'really', 'tackle', 'role', 'just', 'had', 'really', 'high', 'expectations', 'finished', 'product', 'just', 'less-than-stellar', 'most', 'due', 'incredibly', 'choppy', 'confusing', 'script', 'One', 'big', 'problems', 'writing', 'several', 'crucial', 'points', 'unresolved', 'example', 'never', 'depth', 'failures', 'Ali', 'first', 'two', 'marriages', 'Instead', 'right', 'problems', 'tensions', ""'re"", 'just', 'trivial', 'little', 'facts', 'problem', 'movie', 'chronological', 'order', 'events', 'not', ""n't"", 'follow', 'chronological', 'order', 'Ali', 'life', 'never', 'know', 'EXACTLY', 'WHERE', ""'re"", ""'re"", 'given', 'date', '1964', 'beginning', 'nothing', 'Are', 'just', ""s'posed"", 'figure', 'out', 'ourselves', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'along', 'well', 'enough', 'know', 'when', 'year', 'two', 'years', 'Smith', ""n't"", 'really', 'age', 'course', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'aspect', 'really', 'aggravated', 'Most', 'cast', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'few', 'supporting', 'players', 'actually', 'turn', 'excellent', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'particularly', 'Jaimie', 'Fox', 'Bundini', 'Brown', 'John', 'Voight', 'who', 'gave', 'incredibly', 'authentic', 'performance', 'Howard', 'Cossell', 'Nona', 'Gaye', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'Ali', 'second', 'wife', 'Belinda', 'quite', 'admirable', 'considering', 'was', 'given', 'very', 'little', 'work', 'with.Basically', 'few', 're-writes', 'script', 'maybe', 'different', 'director', 'would', ""'ve"", 'suited', 'movie', 'just', 'fine', 'not', 'say', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'hacked', 'up', 'was', 'worth', 'very', 'beautiful-looking', 'film', 'using', 'popular', 'music', ""'60s"", ""'70s"", 'quite', 'well', 'heighten', 'emotions', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'authentic', 'aura', 'time', 'period', 'overall', 'feeling', 'style', 'substance', 'like', 'Mann', 'director', 'done', 'good', 'work', 'past', 'movies', ""'Heat"", 'widely-acclaimed', ""'The"", 'Insider', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'man', 'job.The', 'only', 'two', 'moments', 'film', 'really', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'were', 'Ali', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'hearing', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'death', 'final', 'boxing', 'match', 'Zaire', 'George', 'Foreman', ""'d"", 'say', 'least', 'rent', 'movie', 'scenes', 'alone', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'great', 'performances', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'totally', 'grabbed', 'DVD', 'basically', 'features', 'kind', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'details', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'would', ""'ve"", 'cared', 'maybe', 'seeing', 'interviews', 'real', 'Ali', 'maybe', 'television', 'archives', 'boxing', 'matches', 'press', 'conferences', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'dryness', 'fool', 'ya', 'NOT', 'means', 'terrible', 'movie', 'just', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'MUCH', 'better']",Ali
588858,A3SF2N0BJF0YJS,B00005JKMQ,N. Caine,"[2, 6]","Despite the enormous hype and promotion of Smith's &quot;transformation&quot; into Ali, I can only suppose that Mann -- who originally could not get the movie funded, especially after the tragically unsuccessful masterpiece The Insider-- was saddled with Smith as a condition of getting the money.  After all, in Hollywood, such a large budget could not be banked on anyone but Smith or Denzel, and Denzel can't play every single black hero, since he always looks just like, well, Denzel.  But Smith, without a doubt a likeable and charismatic actor, is all wrong for the part.  Despite the hype of voice training, he doesn't get Ali's voice or cadence right at all.  He's superb in the boxing scenes, and these are the best part of the film, but otherwise Smith's Ali lacks Ali's CHARM.  When Smith does Ali's famous playing with a child, &quot;Did I hurt you?&quot; (pretending to have punched him too fast to be seen), we don't feel like laughing with Ali's humanity, we feel like Smith just made a bad, self-serving joke.For all of his poetic rants, Ali's gift (even in the ring) was his sphynx-like quality.  Even through his throaty braggadocio, one was always left wondering: &quot;Does he really understand boxing tactics, or is he just saying he does?  Does he really understand Malcolm X's complicated African nationalism, or is he just mimicking?&quot;  Mann's script is underrated, precisely because it preserves these questions instead of other treatments which take one side or the other.  But Smith walks through looking simultaneously cocky and bewildered, and that's not the same thing as the quiet and intense sphinx with the Mona Lisa smile, which was Ali.At the same time, for all my admiration of Mann, one senses that he became too infatuated with historical accuracy for the mileau and boxing, and paid insufficient attention to the pacing (which is unweildy and inconsistent, so the audience yawns when they should be tense, poised for a climax) and to the supporting performances.  Peebles is an embarrassment as Malcolm X, for example.Mann was in a Catch-22.  Ali is maybe the best biography of the twentieth-century, but there is no bankable Hollywood star appropriate for the role.  Given that reality, he should not have made the movie.  One senses Mann's integrity (shown in everything from Last of the Mohicans to Heat to The Insider) was somehow compromised here by his wishful thinking that he could make Smith into Ali so he could make the story.The story is more engaging and thought-provoking in the dvd &quot;When They Were Kings.&quot;",3,Not Mann's best:  Smith a disappointment,1020384000,"05 3, 2002",2002,2573,"['enormous', 'hype', 'promotion', 'Smith', 'quot', 'transformation', 'quot', 'Ali', 'can', 'only', 'suppose', 'Mann', 'who', 'originally', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'movie', 'funded', 'especially', 'tragically', 'unsuccessful', 'masterpiece', 'Insider', 'was', 'saddled', 'Smith', 'condition', 'getting', 'money', 'Hollywood', 'large', 'budget', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'banked', 'anyone', 'Smith', 'Denzel', 'Denzel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'single', 'black', 'hero', 'always', 'just', 'like', 'well', 'Denzel', 'Smith', 'doubt', 'likeable', 'charismatic', 'actor', 'wrong', 'part', 'hype', 'voice', 'training', ""n't"", 'get', 'Ali', 'voice', 'cadence', 'right', 'superb', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'otherwise', 'Smith', 'Ali', 'Ali', 'CHARM', 'When', 'Smith', 'Ali', 'famous', 'playing', 'child', 'quot', 'Did', 'hurt', 'quot', 'pretending', 'have', 'punched', 'too', 'fast', 'be', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'laughing', 'Ali', 'humanity', 'feel', 'Smith', 'just', 'made', 'bad', 'self-serving', 'joke.For', 'poetic', 'rants', 'Ali', 'gift', 'even', 'ring', 'was', 'sphynx-like', 'quality', 'Even', 'throaty', 'braggadocio', 'one', 'was', 'always', 'left', 'wondering', 'quot', 'really', 'understand', 'boxing', 'tactics', 'just', 'saying', 'Does', 'really', 'understand', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'complicated', 'African', 'nationalism', 'just', 'mimicking', 'quot', 'Mann', 'script', 'underrated', 'precisely', 'questions', 'instead', 'other', 'treatments', 'take', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'Smith', 'walks', 'looking', 'simultaneously', 'cocky', 'bewildered', 'not', 'same', 'thing', 'quiet', 'intense', 'sphinx', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'smile', 'was', 'Ali.At', 'same', 'time', 'admiration', 'Mann', 'one', 'became', 'too', 'infatuated', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'mileau', 'boxing', 'paid', 'insufficient', 'attention', 'pacing', 'unweildy', 'inconsistent', 'audience', 'yawns', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'tense', 'poised', 'climax', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Peebles', 'embarrassment', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'example.Mann', 'was', 'Catch-22', 'Ali', 'maybe', 'best', 'biography', 'twentieth-century', 'bankable', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'appropriate', 'role', 'Given', 'reality', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'One', 'Mann', 'integrity', 'shown', 'everything', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Heat', 'Insider', 'was', 'somehow', 'compromised', 'here', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'could', 'make', 'Smith', 'Ali', 'could', 'make', 'story.The', 'story', 'more', 'engaging', 'thought-provoking', 'dvd', 'quot', 'When', 'Were', 'Kings.', 'quot']",Ali

Sometimes Will Smith even looks better than the real Ali in ""When We Where Kings""!Maybe if Ali had been a better movie Smith would have zipped past Denzel but unfortunately the movie is sadly very undernourished on the story front and feels very dull for a man of such stature. This is coming from a director too who is just well under par in this opus. Everything is here! - The fights, the family, the troubles, the controversy, the sets, the era and the players, but what it is missing is the element of hope, achievement, despair, loss, anger, happiness, punishment and every other emotional wallop that you would expect from a character with a biography to die for. The actors all carry and show these emotions but this film does not for some strange reason. It feels that the acting is too distant, far away, not-tangible and ultimate impossible to relate anything much too. You can not seem to find anything about yourself or your roots to bring to the film. There is also thus extremely very little that you can take away with you from it. It makes for a film that has everything on form, strike that! - Oscar winning form - but never seems to want to be entertainment or an art form or much of a motion picture film.It is very hard to put your finger on what makes this film unmemorable. It certainly does not lack substance or drama but it just resides in a detachment of its own narrative which at times may be a bit too convoluted even though the film has nearly a three hour running time. The audience's disengagement can probably be found in Mann's misdirection of the moments in time that jump years but because the character in the last scene is in the next scene it leaves you feeling quite frankly - confused. In fact this type of mystification does reign throughout the movie. You are unsure if Ali is five years older or ten years older. You do not know what has happened to him in-between and the next scene could be five years ahead yet again or the next hour for all you know. Mann never does fix things down for us and so Ali's story remains scattered across the screen.See for it Will Smith though. He does an excellent rendition of the greatest boxer of all time.

But it is still a skillfull, stylish sometimes exciting movie about one of the most exciting and provocative figures in the history of sports. It is not so much a biographical movie as it is an examination of the man and his times. It is directed by Michael Mann (The Insider, Heat) with a rich visual style and focus. It does not span all of Ali's life but what it does explore it explores with a good amount of depth. Will Smith gives a great performance, his best ever on film, as the famed boxer and brings out some of the spirit and human side of Muhammad Ali. The boxing sequences are extremely convincing and exciting as well as the press conference sequences. The main problem with this film is the screenplay by Mann and Eric Roth (who got an Oscar nomination with Mann for &quot;The Insider&quot; and won for &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;), it does not strive to be a true dissection of Ali's life, it concentrates more on style and big names. Half of the movie concentrates on Ali's friendship with Malcolm X, which is fine, for a few minutes. You really don't learn anything you haven't seen already in Spike Lee's &quot;Malcolm X&quot; and Mario Van Peebles, good as he is, takes up too much space. We want to see an exhilarating, epic movie about an epic man and his epic career. This is more just a picking at Ali's brain and personal issues.

588869,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JKMQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","""Ali"" runs an impressive 157 minutes - yet we don't feel as if we know much more about Muhammad Ali THE PERSON at the end of the film than we did at the beginning.  Sure, we may know more facts and details about his life than we did before but not about what really makes him TICK.Of course, any film that attempts to record the life of a man is, by necessity, going to have to pick and choose which of the many events of that life to leave in and which to throw out.  Granted.  But the cursory nature of the screenplay causes a serious problem for this film.  The story picks up Ali's life in 1964, back when he was still known as Cassius Clay, de-throning Sonny Liston to become heavyweight-boxing champion of the world.  The time in his life before this event is dealt with in elliptical fashion.  We see virtually nothing about how he was raised, what his parents were like, what kind of values they instilled in him, what motivated him to become a boxer and, most importantly, what drew him so passionately to the creed espoused by the Nation of Islam.  Without this crucial understanding of his formative years, the Ali we see in the film seems a very superficial version of the undoubtedly more complex real life figure.  For all the screenplay's devotion to the minutiae of Ali's career as a boxer, his travels to Africa, his experiences with women, his world-famous bouts with Joe Frasier and George Foreman, the Ali of this film remains a frustrating enigma from first moment to last.  Worse, he remains static as a character, never undergoing the kind of mental, emotional or psychological growth one would expect a biography to show us.  Even his trademark egotism comes across as just a front for public consumption since he doesn't exhibit any undue arrogance in his dealings with those around him when he is out of the limelight.  Perhaps that might be the point the film is trying to make, but if it is, it is never clearly or effectively exploited to any thematic or dramatic purpose.That is not to say that the film does not provide some ancillary pleasures.  Certainly, its strongest asset is its ability to recreate a fascinating time in world history.  Since Ali's life seemed to touch on so many of the key events of that era - racism, Black Pride, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. - his story actually becomes emblematic of the times in which he prospered.  Director Michael Mann manages to capture the flavor of that moment in bold, telling strokes, in large crowd scenes and in glimpses of protest riots and the brutal slayings of unarmed men. Yet, when necessary, Mann proves himself the master of both understatement and subtlety, as in his almost indirect depiction of King's killing.  In terms of their editing, the boxing scenes seem somehow less dynamic - and thereby perhaps a bit more realistic - than those in many other films on the subject.Will Smith does an excellent job in bringing Ali to life, even if the script doesn't always provide him with the material he could have used to get at the core of the man's being.  Jon Voight does an effective job under all the makeup impersonating the inimitable Howard Cosell, yet, here too, we are never really shown just how this obviously symbiotic relationship between the boxer and the sportscaster ever came to develop.  It is crucial details like these which seem to be missing all throughout the movie.  Thus, despite the wonderful time capsule aspect of the film, ""Ali"" emerges as a disappointingly superficial study of its subject.For whatever reason, the lives of boxers remain prime grist for the moviemaking mill.  In just the last few years alone, we have had films made about both ""Hurricane"" Carter and Muhammad Ali.

Will Smith is phenomenal. He was fantastic and really helped to bring the viewer to having an experience rather than just watching a movie.You see that while Ali stood up for his beliefs and had a great charismatic flair with the media, he was less than a gem when it came to his fidelity with the women he married... especially when those who married him were totally devoted to him and gave him good advice that he dismissed and ignored.Ali was and still is a fascinating human being and is known as being the most famous living person on earth... pretty stupendous accomplishment in of itself.My less than perfect rating for the film does not reflect upon the acting of any member of the cast... they were all phenomenal and Mario Van Peebles will blow you away with his portrayal of Malcom X.  Jon Voight outdid himself as Howard Cosell and Jamie Foxx deserves big-time recognition for his role as Bundini, the author of many Ali quotes such as &quot;float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.&quot;The film opens up with the location and date... 1957. You see young Cassius Clay going to the back of the bus with his mother and you see him read a disturbing story about the torture-murder of a young black boy in the south... this is obviously intended as a glimpse to his motivation as an adult to convert to Islam, but this is the only such overt scene.As the show continues, there are no more on-screen texts telling you the date, so there is not only a continuity problem, you are really wondering... what date is this supposed to be?The movie should have been a bit longer and have included more character development of Ali as a child.The world knows the adult Ali from the media... and much of the film involves his public persona, not the underpinnings of what motivates him to cheat on his wife or for him to stay aligned with the Nation of Islam after they ban Ali from being a Muslim for publicly stating he was broke (hence unwittingly stating that the Nation of Islam had mis-managed his funds). Despite the murder of his good friend Malcom X at the hands of those working for the Nation of Islam, Ali stands behind the organization and continues to covort with the same folks as before. Sticking to one's faith doesn't need to be explained, but why he stuck with this same organization and this same motley crew is not explained and therefore befuddling.There are some scenes that should have been on the cutting room floor but instead were left in the movie for some unknown reason... my best guess is just to pepper the movie with as many historical references as possible tied in with Ali's fighting career.Levar Burton portrays Martin Luther King, Jr., but you never hear him speak in the film. You see him once in a newspaper photo and then laying dead after being shot... there is no reason to have included these two scenes that are in no way connected to the rest of the movie. MLK may have been closely tied in with Ali's story in real life, but the film drops the ball in explaining the relationship.Later you see the leader of the African nation in which Ali fights George Foreman have a covert meeting with Idi Amin. This disjointed scene has no overt connection with the rest of the film and appears to be another effort to squeeze in another Trivial Persuit question/answer into the film.The film ends with some last-minute paragraphs in an attempt to tie up Ali's life in a little bow. This film had the potential to be so much more than it was. Ali was and still is a larger-than life character, but the film does not step up the plate. The teleplay needed some major re-working and a number of scenes were lacking when others should have been edited out. Character development is far more important than including frivilous details.There are many funny moments and the outstanding performances will be more memorable than the film itself.

588877,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B00005JKMQ,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[0, 0]","Though few people in the cast even remotely resemble the people they portray--one would think that Wil Smith, in particular, is just too homely to play the baby-faced Ali, well known for comments about his looks and those of others--Michael Mann's take on the legendary fighter's life merits viewing for many reasons, not the least of which is its determination to focus on Ali as a man rather than a black man.  Sure, racism, civil rights, the influence of Islam, and other issues, perhaps, common in films about the experiences of African Americans turn up, but they never overshadow the focus on Ali as a human being whose combination of bravado and personal ethics made him either a role model or a pariah to so many people in the 1960s and 1970s.  Surprisingly, the usually lightweight Smith delivers a complex and generally satisfying performance as Ali, showing the man's inner strength with a quiet determination, even if in his more boisterous moments Smith borders on caricature.  (The major weakness of the film is that too many characters come across as caricatures, Jon Voight's muppet-like Howard Cosell being the worst offender.)  The rest of the cast, including Jamie Foxx, Ron Silver, Joe Morton, Mykelti Williams and other familiar faces, deliver the goods, though Nona Gaye, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Michael Michelle shine in particular as the women in Ali's life.  And while its fight scenes never equal those of either &quot;Rocky&quot; or &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; the visceral moments of the film still carry great weight, in part because of  the effective score and in part because Mann captures reasonably well the look and feel of the period without any &quot;Miami Vice&quot; gloss.",4,"Too Many Caricatures, but Overall a Fine Film",1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,1706,"['few', 'people', 'cast', 'even', 'remotely', 'resemble', 'people', 'portray', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Wil', 'Smith', 'particular', 'just', 'too', 'homely', 'play', 'baby-faced', 'Ali', 'well', 'known', 'comments', 'looks', 'others', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'take', 'legendary', 'fighter', 'life', 'merits', 'viewing', 'many', 'reasons', 'not', 'least', 'determination', 'focus', 'Ali', 'man', 'rather', 'black', 'man', 'Sure', 'racism', 'civil', 'rights', 'influence', 'Islam', 'other', 'issues', 'perhaps', 'common', 'films', 'experiences', 'African', 'Americans', 'turn', 'up', 'never', 'overshadow', 'focus', 'Ali', 'human', 'being', 'combination', 'bravado', 'personal', 'ethics', 'made', 'role', 'model', 'pariah', 'so', 'many', 'people', '1960s', '1970s', 'Surprisingly', 'usually', 'lightweight', 'Smith', 'delivers', 'complex', 'generally', 'satisfying', 'performance', 'Ali', 'showing', 'man', 'inner', 'strength', 'quiet', 'determination', 'even', 'more', 'boisterous', 'moments', 'Smith', 'borders', 'caricature', 'major', 'weakness', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'come', 'caricatures', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'muppet-like', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'being', 'worst', 'offender', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Joe', 'Morton', 'Mykelti', 'Williams', 'other', 'familiar', 'deliver', 'goods', 'though', 'Nona', 'Gaye', 'Jada', 'Pinkett-Smith', 'Michael', 'Michelle', 'shine', 'particular', 'women', 'Ali', 'life', 'fight', 'scenes', 'never', 'equal', 'quot', 'Rocky', 'quot', 'quot', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'quot', 'visceral', 'moments', 'film', 'still', 'great', 'weight', 'part', 'effective', 'score', 'part', 'Mann', 'reasonably', 'well', 'look', 'feel', 'period', 'quot', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'quot', 'gloss']",Ali

""New films by Scorcese, Mann, Darabont, Crowe and the ""Rushmore"" guys are due before the end of the year. How bad could the year be?"" Well, Miramax, in their infinite wisdom, delayed Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York"". Apparently, they were concerned about the public's reaction to a film set in 19th Century New York after the attacks of September 11. Presumably, they are using the extra time to use computers to erase any shots of the World Trade Center. That left four films to anticipate and hope for. A 50% batting average is pretty bad. ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" is a great film. ""The Majestic"" is a very good film. Hmmm. That leaves the Cameron Crowe and Michael Mann films. Both filmmakers have created some of my favorite films of all time. So it is extremely disappointing to have the experience of watching Mann's ""Ali"", starring Will Smith.""Ali"" tells the story of Muhammad Ali (Will Smith) from 1964 until the famous Rumble In The Jungle. It seems to be a faithful visual recreation of the important events, but this is merely the frosting on the cake. What we don't get is the cake. The poster tagline is ""Forget everything you know"". Well, I don't know that much about his life, but I knew most of what was depicted. What wasn't depicted very successfully was `Why?'. The area the film depicts very well is Ali's struggle with religion. A brief flashback depicts his mixed feelings about his father's (Giancarlo Esposito) religion. This coupled with his feelings about race and the struggle of the African American man leads him to Malcolm X (Mario Van Pebbles) and the Muslim religion. Some of the film depicts their relationship, but then Ali seems to make a very conscious decision, yet the decision isn't depicted or explained. During the course of the film, Ali falls in love with three women, yet the moment when each relationship ends is not explained very well or very carefully. Most of the relationships in the film are handled in a fairly short-handed manner. We find out how they met, but the end of the relationship is left in the dark. Other relationships are just there and we really don't get an idea of how they met Ali or why the relationship continues. For instance, Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) is his trainer throughout the course of the story, but why? Howard Bingham (Jeffrey Wright), a photographer, appears to be at every event depicted in the film, snapping photographs. Each of these characters is really flat. Neither is developed and only seems to serve as background. Drew ""Bundini"" Brown (Jamie Foxx) appears to have been Ali's main supporter during his rise, yet, again, I have to ask `Why?' All of these questions are all the more shocking when you consider the filmmaker. Michael Mann directed ""Heat"", a great crime epic, starring DeNiro and Pacino. In ""Heat"" every single supporting character had a backstory which was explored, giving the film a rich texture.Will Smith clearly spent a lot of time and effort trying to develop his performance as Ali and he does a good job. He is emotional, bombastic, intelligent and motivated. All qualities that I would imagine the real Ali has in spades. But without the direction and the story to complement him, the performance lacks a large element. Why is he like this? What made him like this? We don't ever really find out. A little bit about his life is revealed in his relationship with Malcolm X and the Muslim religion, a little of his struggle with the US and his draft notice. What is lacking is any of the motivation behind his training and his rise to the top.Technically, the film is very good. The film opens with a montage depicting Ali training at the gym as he remembers two key moments in his life. The editing work is good and reveals some of the depth of his character. As the film progresses, the shaky handheld camera work used so consistently becomes annoying and detracts from the film. Meant to evoke a documentary, it robs the film of grandeur and style.Most annoyingly, we really learn nothing about what made Ali a great athlete. We don't see how he trained differently, how he fought differently, anything.""Ali"" really is a disappointing film that did little to illuminate the life of a great athlete.",3,All The Sting Of A Butterfly,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,4329,"['summer', 'experienced', 'one', 'dreadful', 'film', 'developed', 'mantra', 'get', 'New', 'films', 'Scorcese', 'Mann', 'Darabont', 'Crowe', 'Rushmore', 'guys', 'are', 'due', 'end', 'year', 'How', 'bad', 'could', 'year', 'be', 'Well', 'Miramax', 'infinite', 'wisdom', 'delayed', 'Scorcese', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'Apparently', 'were', 'concerned', 'public', 'reaction', 'film', 'set', '19th', 'Century', 'New', 'York', 'attacks', 'September', '11', 'Presumably', 'are', 'using', 'extra', 'time', 'use', 'computers', 'erase', 'shots', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'left', 'four', 'films', 'anticipate', 'hope', '50', '%', 'batting', 'average', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Royal', 'Tennenbaums', 'great', 'film', 'Majestic', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Hmmm', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'films', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'created', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'have', 'experience', 'watching', 'Mann', 'Ali', 'starring', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Ali', 'story', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'Will', 'Smith', '1964', 'famous', 'Rumble', 'Jungle', 'be', 'faithful', 'visual', 'recreation', 'important', 'events', 'merely', 'frosting', 'cake', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'cake', 'poster', 'tagline', 'Forget', 'everything', 'know', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'that', 'much', 'life', 'knew', 'most', 'what', 'was', 'depicted', 'What', 'was', ""n't"", 'depicted', 'very', 'successfully', 'was', 'Why', 'area', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'Ali', 'struggle', 'religion', 'brief', 'flashback', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'father', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'religion', 'coupled', 'feelings', 'race', 'struggle', 'African', 'American', 'man', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Mario', 'Van', 'Pebbles', 'Muslim', 'religion', 'film', 'relationship', 'then', 'Ali', 'make', 'very', 'conscious', 'decision', 'decision', ""n't"", 'depicted', 'explained', 'course', 'film', 'Ali', 'love', 'three', 'women', 'moment', 'when', 'relationship', 'not', 'explained', 'very', 'well', 'very', 'carefully', 'Most', 'relationships', 'film', 'are', 'handled', 'fairly', 'short-handed', 'manner', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'met', 'end', 'relationship', 'left', 'dark', 'Other', 'relationships', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'idea', 'how', 'met', 'Ali', 'why', 'relationship', 'instance', 'Ali', 'trainer', 'Angelo', 'Dundee', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'trainer', 'course', 'story', 'why', 'Howard', 'Bingham', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'photographer', 'be', 'event', 'depicted', 'film', 'snapping', 'photographs', 'characters', 'really', 'flat', 'developed', 'only', 'serve', 'background', 'Drew', 'Bundini', 'Brown', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'have', 'been', 'Ali', 'main', 'supporter', 'rise', 'yet', 'again', 'have', 'ask', 'Why', 'questions', 'are', 'more', 'shocking', 'when', 'consider', 'filmmaker', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'directed', 'Heat', 'great', 'crime', 'epic', 'starring', 'DeNiro', 'Pacino', 'Heat', 'single', 'supporting', 'character', 'had', 'backstory', 'was', 'explored', 'giving', 'film', 'rich', 'texture.Will', 'Smith', 'clearly', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'effort', 'trying', 'develop', 'performance', 'Ali', 'good', 'job', 'emotional', 'bombastic', 'intelligent', 'motivated', 'qualities', 'would', 'imagine', 'real', 'Ali', 'spades', 'direction', 'story', 'complement', 'performance', 'large', 'element', 'Why', 'What', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'find', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'life', 'revealed', 'relationship', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Muslim', 'religion', 'little', 'struggle', 'US', 'draft', 'notice', 'What', 'lacking', 'motivation', 'training', 'rise', 'top.Technically', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'montage', 'depicting', 'Ali', 'training', 'gym', 'two', 'key', 'moments', 'life', 'editing', 'work', 'good', 'depth', 'character', 'film', 'shaky', 'handheld', 'camera', 'work', 'used', 'so', 'consistently', 'annoying', 'detracts', 'film', 'Meant', 'evoke', 'documentary', 'film', 'grandeur', 'style.Most', 'annoyingly', 'really', 'learn', 'nothing', 'what', 'made', 'Ali', 'great', 'athlete', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'trained', 'differently', 'how', 'fought', 'differently', 'anything', 'Ali', 'really', 'disappointing', 'film', 'did', 'little', 'illuminate', 'life', 'great', 'athlete']",Ali

In addition, he is also surrounded by some interesting personalities:Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) - Ali's faithful trainerHoward Cosell (Jon Voight) - sportscaster whose on-camera tussles with Ali, in which Cosell takes all the comedic beatings, masks a deep friendship between the two'Bundini' Brown (Jamie Foxx) - Ali's moral supporter who has disappointed him in more ways than oneMalcolm X (Mario van Peebles) - influential speaker for the nation of Islam, the catalyst of Ali's Islam conversion, and with whom Ali forged a mutual respect and social beliefsCassius Sr.(Giancarlo Esposito) - an artist, and Ali's father though not a very good one in his opinionElijah Muhammad (Albert Hall) - the conservative head of the Nation of Islam, and the one responsible for giving Ali his current nameHerbert Muhammad (Barry Shabaka Henley) - son of Elijah, and Ali's not-so-dependable managerDon King  (Mykelti Williamson) - boxing promoter whose flamboyance is rivaled only by his love of making moneyHoward Bingham (Jeffrey Wright) - Ali's no-nonsense agent and best friendChauncey Eskridge (Joe Morton) - Ali's reliable attorneyAnd he is also a ladies' man.  Who can forget his bevy of wives which he has captured in suave but poetic fashion - the first Sonji Roi (Jada Pinkett Smith), the second Belinda Boyd (Nona M. Gaye), and the third Veronica Porsche (Michael Michele) whom he met in Zaire prior to the Ali-Foreman bout but did not marry onscreen.  Plus, the closing lines stated that he took one more wife.  Let's not forget his longsuffering mother Odessa (Candy Ann Brown).The screenplay covering Ali's prominent moments of his professional career does not deviate from historical facts.  They are presented in three parts: the beginning part details his entry into fame with the Ali-Liston fight, his conversion and name change, and his associations with Macolm X; the middle part focuses on his trials, vindication and the Ali-Frazier fight; the final part culminates on the Ali-Foreman fights.  Director Michael Mann does a terrific job in keeping these three parts distinct.  However, he spotlights almost exclusively on Ali's public life in the final part.  He also included some scenes that are better left out, as they are more unimportant than informative.  Chief among them being cameos by LeVar Burton as Martin Luther King in only one scene - the assassination scene - and Malick Bowens as despotic Zairian president Mobutu dining in his palace.  So we know these two political figures exist, but what purpose do their scenes serve?  Another distraction is the excessive coverage of Malcolm X, which includes his assassination shown in gratuitous gore.  Even with the coverage minimized, his liasons with Ali would still be effectively presented, instead of taking up nearly the entire beginning part.As the Champ, Will Smith is The Greatest.  He captures the iconic personality perfectly, which Mann successfully translates to film with adept close-up shots while zooming out appropriately to capture Ali's flamboyant speeches.  His boxing sequences are riveting, thanks largely to Michael Bentt, James Toney and Charles Shufford, who play Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier and George Foreman respectively.  They are interspersed with slow motion sequences to heighten the hair-raising tension of getting clobbered by a devastating uppercut.  Although the actual fights themselves are far less dramatic than Mann's version.  Foxx is surprisingly impressive in a non-comedy role, even adding some comedy routines of his own without disrupting the drama.  Another great performance of mention is Voight being almost unrecognizable as Cosell with his conspicuous toupee and his stiff but somewhat goofy portrayal.  Now we know he can do comedy.""Ali"" concludes immediately after Ali's victory over Foreman, which seems abrupt.  The tensions between the Champ and Belinda was neither fully played out nor resolved.  I was half-expecting it to continue with Ali divorcing her and moving on to marry his third.  Indeed, ""Ali"" certainly floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee, but is overshadowed by Will Smith and the larger-than-life icon that he portrays.  Don't be disappointed if Muhammad Ali himself does not appear at all.",4,Almost The Greatest!,1009324800,"12 26, 2001",2001,4838,"['defeated', 'Sonny', 'Liston', '1964', 'heavyweight', 'title',

588884,A18M68DE1Y6W51,B00005JKMQ,Wendy Kaplan,"[0, 0]","This is not a perfect movie by any means. But Will Smith is brilliant as Ali, particularly during the early part of the film, where he superbly portrays the boxer in his young Cassius Clay days. I remember those years when Cassius Clay came to prominence, and Smith captures his spirit, his cheekiness, his strength, and his sheer, confident youth to a tee. As Clay grows as a boxer and as a man, embraces the Muslim faith, and becomes Muhammad Ali, he changes more than his religion and name. The cockiness is still there, but so is the cynicism and disappointment brought on by too much fame, too much money, too many women, too many hangers-on. Smith handles the change from brash youth to more thoughtful man with subtlety and aplomb.The disappointing part of the film, which begins to drag on and on, is the lack of depth in Ali's relationships. His marriages are glossed over quickly...we get no sense of what he is really thinking, or what his private life is really like. The same holds true of his relationships with his entourage, from his manager on down. If this was meant to come across as aloofness, it didn't work; this viewer found it very frustrating.Nevertheless, the movie is worth seeing, for the sheer exuberance of Smith's acting, and the absolutely dead-on portrayal of the late sportscaster Howard Cosell, rendered fabulously by Jon Voight. It is not a brilliant movie, but in my view, it deserves more than 3 stars.

This movie is amazing!!! And the recreation of the fight scenes are just magical, thanks to master director Michael Mann.i'm very surpised of what a great actor will smith can be...it just about the roles!!..great acting all the way. Dante Spinoti gives once more an unforgetable cinematographic journey, wich is a tradition in almost all michael mann movies. over all the film is really entertaining. I'm a film student and a huge Michael Mann/Dante Spinoti fan and this film is a great oportunity to see this two masters work together. Class a film all the way. So if you really want to see a different american movie...try this and pay great attention to the visual that cinematic gennius spinoti brings on to this films. The sountrack, like in every Mann movie, is just espectacular!Don't pay attention to the others people reviews, they are just used to watch the typical every day movie. sorry for the spelling, i'm not from the U.S.A, but this doesn't mean that i don't know a great movie when i see one.",5,the mann-spinoti connection!!!!!,1045267200,"02 15, 2003",2003,1320,"['i', 'just', 'saw', 'movie', 'hbo', '.and', 'i', 'was', 'amazed', '.this', 'very', 'different', 'film', 'well', 'everything', 'michael', 'mann', 'vision', 'quite', 'different', 'i', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'i', 'loved', 'yes', 'slow', 'long', 'inconcistant', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'want', 'action', 'get', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'film', 'movie', 'amazing', 'recreation', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'magical', 'thanks', 'master', 'director', 'Michael', 'Mann.i', ""'m"", 'very', 'surpised', 'what', 'great', 'actor', 'will', 'smith', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'roles', '..great', 'acting', 'way', 'Dante', 'Spinoti', 'once', 'more', 'unforgetable', 'cinematographic', 'journey', 'wich', 'tradition', 'almost', 'michael', 'mann', 'movies', 'film', 'really', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'film', 'student', 'huge', 'Michael', 'Mann/Dante', 'Spinoti', 'fan', 'film', 'great', 'oportunity', 'see', 'two', 'masters', 'work', 'together', 'Class', 'film', 'way', 'So', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'different', 'american', 'movie', 'try', 'pay', 'great', 'attention', 'visual', 'cinematic', 'gennius', 'spinoti', 'brings', 'films', 'sountrack', 'Mann', 'movie', 'just', 'espectacular', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'others', 'people', 'reviews', 'are', 'just', 'used', 'watch', 'typical', 'day', 'movie', 'sorry', 'spelling', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'U.S.A', ""n't"", 'mean', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'great', 'movie', 'when', 'i', 'see', 'one']",Ali
588886,A2GR3LJ5HEYY1M,B00005JKMQ,xyz,"[1, 1]","The title of this review does not mean Ali is a brilliance amidst many other mediocre movies. It actually means one can find some brilliant moments in Ali the movie, but for most of the 2-and-half hour duration, it's boredom and incoherence.I almost fell asleep the first 15 minutes into the movie. I don't think the boxing scenes are exciting, maybe except the last 2 mins of the last one (Ali Vs. Foreman in Zaire)... mostly due to the refreshing soundtrack accompanying that. And there're quite a few long and dragging boxing scenes. I was surprised that the style of shooting the boxing scenes in this movie is pretty similar to that in the Rocky movies (which were made about 20 years ago!). I had expected more artistic touches or maybe even more thrills in the boxings in Ali. But it's disappointing.The movie is more like a collection of anecdotes in Ali's early career than a coherent story, not to mention a drama. As such, there is really not a point in the movie that can be called a climax. Without an interesting storyline, in order to keep the audience mentally involved in the movie, it at least has to offer some superb acting and effective atmosphere.For the acting, it's one of the few brilliant spots of the movie. Will Smith is very good. On the screen, he's totally a people's champ and he portrays Ali's confidence (arrogance) and humor wonderfully. Besides Smith, I think the other cast members in general do a good job, too.However, the second ingredient, the atmosphere, is less than satisfying. The decision to shoot some sequences using hand-held camera is a good one. It gives a more real and historical feel to this cinematic biography. And overall, I think each scene is OK (maybe except the one where thousands of supporters in Zaire are chanting Ali's name for... oh the whole 3 mins or so!). But on a larger scale, the arrangement of the scenes does not seem sharp enough. As I mentioned, too much time is given to too many boxing sequences. A few more scenes describing the mental journey of Ali before and after his decline to join the military would be welcome additions. And I would feel more comfortable if the long scene where Ali stares at his portrayals on his admirers' houses in Zaire is completely deleted (too corny and artificial).The movie wants to give a big picture of Ali to the audience. But it's hard to do because the movie can be only 2 or 3 hours long. Unlike in many other biography flicks like ""A Beautiful Mind"" which revolves around only one or two extraordinary aspects of the character's life (and portrays it with some dramatization), Ali the boxer is presented in a matter-of-fact manner and many different aspects of his life are covered with equal weight. This style is not likely to work if the atmosphere is not really well crafted, which is unfortunately the case here. To me, not a fan of Ali's, he's just another person with some character and some achievement. I'd thought this movie would change my perception somewhat. But even during or after the movie, I really don't feel as though I care much for him. I suppose I would not prefer this movie to a PBS documentary of Ali (if there's one).",3,Glimpses of brilliance in a sea of boredom,1011052800,"01 15, 2002",2002,3165,"['title', 'review', 'not', 'mean', 'Ali', 'brilliance', 'amidst', 'many', 'other', 'mediocre', 'movies', 'actually', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'brilliant', 'moments', 'Ali', 'movie', 'most', '2-and-half', 'hour', 'duration', 'boredom', 'incoherence.I', 'almost', 'fell', 'asleep', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'are', 'exciting', 'maybe', 'last', '2', 'mins', 'last', 'one', 'Ali', 'Vs.', 'Foreman', 'Zaire', 'mostly', 'due', 'refreshing', 'soundtrack', 'accompanying', ""'re"", 'few', 'long', 'dragging', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'was', 'surprised', 'style', 'shooting', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'pretty', 'similar', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'were', 'made', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'expected', 'more', 'artistic', 'touches', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'thrills', 'boxings', 'Ali', 'disappointing.The', 'movie', 'more', 'collection', 'anecdotes', 'Ali', 'early', 'career', 'coherent', 'story', 'not', 'mention', 'drama', 'such', 'really', 'not', 'point', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'climax', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'order', 'keep', 'audience', 'mentally', 'involved', 'movie', 'least', 'offer', 'superb', 'acting', 'effective', 'atmosphere.For', 'acting', 'one', 'few', 'brilliant', 'spots', 'movie', 'Will', 'Smith', 'very', 'good', 'screen', 'totally', 'people', 'champ', 'Ali', 'confidence', 'arrogance', 'wonderfully', 'Smith', 'think', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'general', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'too.However', 'second', 'ingredient', 'atmosphere', 'less', 'satisfying', 'decision', 'shoot', 'sequences', 'using', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'good', 'one', 'more', 'real', 'historical', 'feel', 'cinematic', 'biography', 'overall', 'think', 'scene', 'OK', 'maybe', 'one', 'where', 'thousands', 'supporters', 'Zaire', 'are', 'chanting', 'Ali', 'name', 'whole', '3', 'mins', 'so', 'larger', 'scale', 'arrangement', 'scenes', 'not', 'seem', 'sharp', 'enough', 'mentioned', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'given', 'too', 'many', 'boxing', 'sequences', 'few', 'more', 'scenes', 'describing', 'mental', 'journey', 'Ali', 'decline', 'join', 'military', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'additions', 'would', 'feel', 'more', 'comfortable', 'long', 'scene', 'where', 'Ali', 'portrayals', 'admirers', 'houses', 'Zaire', 'completely', 'deleted', 'too', 'corny', 'artificial', '.The', 'movie', 'give', 'big', 'picture', 'Ali', 'audience', 'hard', 'do', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'only', '2', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'many', 'other', 'biography', 'flicks', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'extraordinary', 'aspects', 'character', 'life', 'dramatization', 'Ali', 'boxer', 'presented', 'matter-of-fact', 'manner', 'many', 'different', 'aspects', 'life', 'are', 'covered', 'equal', 'weight', 'style', 'not', 'likely', 'work', 'atmosphere', 'not', 'really', 'well', 'crafted', 'unfortunately', 'case', 'here', 'not', 'fan', 'Ali', 'just', 'person', 'character', 'achievement', ""'d"", 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'change', 'perception', 'somewhat', 'even', 'movie', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'care', 'much', 'suppose', 'would', 'not', 'prefer', 'movie', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'Ali', 'one']",Ali
