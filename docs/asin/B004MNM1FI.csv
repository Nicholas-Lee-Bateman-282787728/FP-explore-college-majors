1420067,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,B004MNM1FI,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[2, 2]","Director Carlos Cesar Arbelaez won the Best New Director Award at the San Sebastian Film Festival for his Los Colores de la Monta&ntilde;a (The Colors of the Mountain) his debut feature. The film deals with the issue of sociopolitical conflict in a remote mountain region of Columbia as seen through the eyes of a child. While looking at war through a child's eyes is not new in cinema Abelaez concentrates on the small issues of life and leaves most of the violence off screen.Manuel (Hernan Mauricio Ocampo) has just been given a new soccer ball for his ninth birthday. He and his friends kick the ball onto the local soccer field which has been newly mined by the paramilitary forces who are occupying his region of the country. The remainder of the film sees Manuel and his friends Julian( Nolberto Sanchez) and Paco Luz trying to get the ball back. As this is happening the adults in the village are trying to carry on their lives while caught between the military forces and the guerilla bands that are slowly moving in. According to Arbelaez the ball is a metaphor for the ridiculous nature of the life the villagers are living.Shot almost entirely from the children's perspective, Arbel&aacute;ez tackles universal themes of conflict and its impact on ordinary people without getting mired in specific politics. He deftly shows how quickly normality can disintegrate when conflict appears on the horizon. And despite having serious subject matter, he has a lightness of touch, an avoidance of outright displays of violence and an eye for the comedic that means older children could enjoy this as much as adults. Arbel&aacute;ez was a deserving winner of the New Director's award at the San Sebastian Film Festival last year and this sweetly powerful debut suggests he's a name to look out for in future.Film Movement has done a great job with this film and the presentation is as vibrant as anything I've seen in the recent crop of major studio releases. The photography by Oscar Jimenez brings out all the colors and natural beauty of the mountanous region of Columbia and a times is quite stunning. I have been told that this film will be released in the United States later this summer and the chance to see it before the official release was a welcome one. This is a film with great promise and is definately worth seeking out.",4,Great Debut Film From Talented New Director,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,2339,"['Director', 'Carlos', 'Cesar', 'Arbelaez', 'won', 'Best', 'New', 'Director', 'Award', 'San', 'Sebastian', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Los', 'Colores', 'de', 'la', 'Monta', 'ntilde', 'Colors', 'Mountain', 'debut', 'feature', 'film', 'deals', 'issue', 'sociopolitical', 'conflict', 'remote', 'mountain', 'region', 'Columbia', 'seen', 'eyes', 'child', 'looking', 'war', 'child', 'eyes', 'not', 'new', 'cinema', 'Abelaez', 'small', 'issues', 'life', 'most', 'violence', 'screen.Manuel', 'Hernan', 'Mauricio', 'Ocampo', 'just', 'been', 'given', 'new', 'soccer', 'ball', 'ninth', 'birthday', 'friends', 'kick', 'ball', 'local', 'soccer', 'field', 'been', 'newly', 'mined', 'paramilitary', 'forces', 'who', 'are', 'occupying', 'region', 'country', 'remainder', 'film', 'Manuel', 'friends', 'Julian', 'Nolberto', 'Sanchez', 'Paco', 'Luz', 'trying', 'get', 'ball', 'back', 'happening', 'adults', 'village', 'are', 'trying', 'carry', 'lives', 'caught', 'military', 'forces', 'guerilla', 'are', 'slowly', 'moving', 'According', 'Arbelaez', 'ball', 'metaphor', 'ridiculous', 'nature', 'life', 'villagers', 'are', 'living.Shot', 'almost', 'entirely', 'children', 'perspective', 'Arbel', 'aacute', 'tackles', 'universal', 'themes', 'conflict', 'impact', 'ordinary', 'people', 'getting', 'mired', 'specific', 'politics', 'deftly', 'how', 'quickly', 'normality', 'can', 'disintegrate', 'when', 'conflict', 'horizon', 'having', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'lightness', 'touch', 'avoidance', 'outright', 'displays', 'violence', 'eye', 'comedic', 'older', 'children', 'could', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'adults', 'Arbel', 'aacute', 'was', 'deserving', 'winner', 'New', 'Director', 'award', 'San', 'Sebastian', 'Film', 'Festival', 'last', 'year', 'sweetly', 'powerful', 'debut', 'name', 'look', 'out', 'future.Film', 'Movement', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'presentation', 'as', 'vibrant', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'crop', 'major', 'studio', 'releases', 'photography', 'Oscar', 'Jimenez', 'out', 'colors', 'natural', 'beauty', 'mountanous', 'region', 'Columbia', 'times', 'quite', 'stunning', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'United', 'States', 'later', 'summer', 'chance', 'see', 'official', 'release', 'was', 'welcome', 'one', 'film', 'great', 'promise', 'definately', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out']",The Colors of the Mountain
1420068,AN9J46667D80O,B004MNM1FI,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[1, 1]","(special thanks to Film Movement for providing me with a screener!)Growing up anywhere isn't really easy, especially once you hit the age of nine or so. At that age, you're starting to understand that there's a greater adult world that you don't have access to, and that doesn't intersect with your own, except for certain horrible times. Hard though being at that age is anywhere, I can only imagine how much worse it must be to be a child and grow up in a war zone. That's the situation in which young Manuel finds himself in The Colors of the Mountain.The story centers around a picturesque mountain village in Colombia. It's a place where families scrape by, earning what they can by farming. You know, the standard salt-of-the-earth kind of people. They ask nothing from life and get even less.Manuel lives there with his mother, farther and little baby brother. His biggest passion in life is soccer, though he also enjoys drawing and loves hanging out with his friends Julian and Poca Luz. He even loves going to school, though at least in part that seems to be due to him developing a crush on a girl there and on his teacher.Not all is well in Manuel's world, though he's not really aware of that fact. His village is in an area where rebels are fighting the national military; each of whom seem to be worse than the other. Manuel's father walks a narrow line of not supporting either, and, well, you know what happens with people like that in wars like this.Manuel is vaguely aware of these things happening, but not really. The war is something that doesn't matter to him. Or at least it doesn't matter until his birthday rolls around and he gets a soccer ball which winds up in the middle of a minefield...This really is a wonderful movie. It's very touching and at times very funny. The performances all around are excellent, especially by Hernan Maurico Ocampo, who plays Manuel.Also, the film is flat-out beautiful, showing the lush countryside of the Colombian mountains. Like most Americans, those mountains are something I'm really only accustomed to seeing in news reports about the ongoing drug war. It's nice to see them in a somewhat more pleasant way.And I must say, I found myself really caring about the characters. There's at least a couple whose fate is left up in the air at the end of the movie, and I'd really like to learn what became of them (though I suspect the answer is ""nothing good"").This isn't always an easy movie to watch, and it's one that I'd have a tough time recommending for younger children. But it is a beautiful, well-acted and generally wonderful film and for any adult audience, I highly recommend it.=== Short Film ===This month's short film is a Cuban film called ""The Swimmers"". It's about a determined swim coach who wants his young charges to be the best swimmers around. The fact that their pool is currently devoid of water is something he seems to view as merely a minor setback.This was a good film, and quite funny in parts, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the main feature. It's worth seeing, but it's not worth picking up the disc just for this movie.",5,Growing up in a war zone,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,3122,"['special', 'thanks', 'Film', 'Movement', 'providing', 'screener', 'Growing', 'up', 'anywhere', ""n't"", 'really', 'easy', 'especially', 'once', 'hit', 'age', 'nine', 'so', 'age', ""'re"", 'starting', 'understand', 'greater', 'adult', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'access', ""n't"", 'intersect', 'own', 'certain', 'horrible', 'times', 'Hard', 'being', 'age', 'anywhere', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'worse', 'must', 'be', 'be', 'child', 'grow', 'up', 'war', 'zone', 'situation', 'young', 'Manuel', 'Colors', 'Mountain.The', 'story', 'centers', 'picturesque', 'mountain', 'village', 'Colombia', 'place', 'where', 'families', 'scrape', 'earning', 'what', 'can', 'farming', 'know', 'standard', 'salt-of-the-earth', 'kind', 'people', 'ask', 'nothing', 'life', 'get', 'even', 'less.Manuel', 'lives', 'there', 'mother', 'farther', 'little', 'baby', 'brother', 'biggest', 'passion', 'life', 'soccer', 'also', 'drawing', 'loves', 'hanging', 'out', 'friends', 'Julian', 'Poca', 'Luz', 'even', 'going', 'school', 'though', 'least', 'part', 'be', 'due', 'developing', 'crush', 'girl', 'there', 'teacher.Not', 'well', 'Manuel', 'world', 'not', 'really', 'aware', 'fact', 'village', 'area', 'where', 'rebels', 'are', 'fighting', 'national', 'military', 'whom', 'seem', 'be', 'worse', 'other', 'Manuel', 'father', 'narrow', 'line', 'not', 'supporting', 'well', 'know', 'what', 'people', 'wars', 'this.Manuel', 'vaguely', 'aware', 'things', 'happening', 'not', 'really', 'war', 'something', ""n't"", 'matter', 'least', ""n't"", 'matter', 'birthday', 'rolls', 'around', 'soccer', 'ball', 'up', 'middle', 'minefield', 'really', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'very', 'touching', 'times', 'very', 'funny', 'performances', 'around', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Hernan', 'Maurico', 'Ocampo', 'who', 'Manuel.Also', 'film', 'flat-out', 'beautiful', 'showing', 'lush', 'countryside', 'Colombian', 'mountains', 'most', 'Americans', 'mountains', 'are', 'something', ""'m"", 'really', 'only', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'news', 'reports', 'ongoing', 'drug', 'war', 'nice', 'see', 'somewhat', 'more', 'pleasant', 'way.And', 'must', 'say', 'found', 'really', 'caring', 'characters', 'least', 'couple', 'fate', 'left', 'up', 'air', 'end', 'movie', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'learn', 'what', 'became', 'suspect', 'answer', 'nothing', 'good', '.This', ""n't"", 'always', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'one', ""'d"", 'have', 'tough', 'time', 'recommending', 'younger', 'children', 'beautiful', 'well-acted', 'generally', 'wonderful', 'film', 'adult', 'audience', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.===', 'Short', 'Film', '===This', 'month', 'short', 'film', 'Cuban', 'film', 'called', 'Swimmers', 'determined', 'swim', 'coach', 'who', 'young', 'charges', 'be', 'best', 'swimmers', 'around', 'fact', 'pool', 'currently', 'devoid', 'water', 'something', 'view', 'merely', 'minor', 'setback.This', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'quite', 'funny', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'main', 'feature', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'disc', 'just', 'movie']",The Colors of the Mountain

1420070,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004MNM1FI,Grady Harp,"[5, 6]","Los Colores de la Monta&ntilde;a (The Colors of the Mountain) is one of the more delicate and sophisticated films to deal with warring factions in South American countries to come along in a long time.  Written and directed by newcomer Carlos C&eacute;sar Arbel&aacute;ez  this story is wise because it explains the work through the eyes of children: perhaps that is the best way to understand the conflicts that flood the planet at present.Set is the lush and picturesque mountains of Colombia, we gradually discover through the games of the children that there are two factions struggling for power in this remote area - the military of the government and the reactive guerrillas.  Manuel (Hern&aacute;n Mauricio Ocampo) is eight and loves soccer even though his soccer ball is an old collapsed mess of toy. He and his friends Juli&aacute;n (Nolberto S&aacute;nchez) and the little albino boy Poca Luz (Hern&aacute;n M&eacute;ndez) play soccer anyplace they can.  Manuel also tends to his duties as a farmer's son (his father is devoted to him, sharing the chores, and protecting him and his wife and baby from the bilateral dangers of the military and the guerrillas): his parents reward him on his ninth birthday with a new soccer ball and gloves.  Very proud, Manuel shares his treasure with his friends but accidentally the ball lands in a minefield (the result of the military invasion) and becomes inaccessible.  The boys challenge Poca Luz to retrieve it but he fails. A new teacher comes to the village and brings order to the chaos the children feel.  Discovering that Manuel colors pictures of his countryside in his notebook the teacher decides to use his talent that that of his friends to paint over political graffiti smeared on the schoolhouse: she loses her job.  Rebel forces and military forces enter the village and families are forced to evacuate - but Manuel manages to recover his treasured new soccer ball in the midst of the senseless fighting the adults of his world are staging. After all, what is really important?!The acting skills of these children are beautifully straightforward and unforced, thanks to the fine direction of Arbel&aacute;ez.  He manages to tell a tale that is tender, humorous, and meaningful and in the end it is the inherent pure wisdom of children that seems to be the sustaining factor in the little villages of the mountains of Colombia.  The lush photography is by Oscar Jimenez.  This is a very fine film that has already won awards in festival, but it is a film that is more important that it be shared by a very large audience.

Boy, am I glad I did.""The Colors of the Mountain"" (originally released in 2010; 93 min.) starts off very innocently, mostly just the life ordinary of Colombian families in the country-side, and focusing on a group of young kids, for whom the most important thing is being able to play football (a/k/a soccer as it's known here in the US). The film moves at glacial speed, and I mean that as a compliment. The kids' biggest problem arises when a soccer ball gets lost in what turns out to be a field mined by the Colombian anti-government guerrilas. As the movie evolves, the influence of the guerrilas in this remote village becomes stronger. I don't want to give more of the plot away, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all turns out. A special mention to the child-actors in the movie, who are nothing short of outstanding, none more than the boy who plays the 9 yr. old main character Manuel.What a terrific movie this is! Thank you Film Movement for releasing this in the US, seriously. This is just one of those ""little"" movies that captures you and leaves you mesmorized.
