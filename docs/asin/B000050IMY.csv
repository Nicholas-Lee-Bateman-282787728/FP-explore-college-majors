I've only used the arms section, but if the abs workout is anything like the arms, it has to be just as great.I really feel as though this workout is doing the trick.  It's too early to tell, but these are standard exercises, so presumably I'll see results in the near future.  I feel great after using this and the Pilates for Dummies DVD!

562993,AL7CB93CEN44E,B000050IMY,"Tanisha ""a lover of books and finer things""","[1, 1]","I just bought this DVD and I absolutely love it.  I had been looking for video's or DVD's that would help me with my weight training at home, since I've given up on gyms.  Doing weight training on my own I didn't know the proper form or in what order to do the exercises to create the most effective routine.  This DVD fixed all that, 8-minutes didn't seem that long so I gave it a try and was sweating and puffing because you move from one exercise to another so quickly with no rest your heart rate stays up.  I alternate this with the 8-minute buns &amp; legs and combine them with Pilates for dummies (video) and my 30-minute treadmill walk.I just started the routine this week but so good so far and I like it, which is a big thing for me.  If your looking for a way to make exercise apart of your life without it taking over your life these tapes/DVD's are the way to go.",5,I Love It!,1055376000,"06 12, 2003",2003,877,"['just', 'bought', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'love', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'video', 'DVD', 'would', 'help', 'weight', 'training', 'home', ""'ve"", 'given', 'up', 'gyms', 'Doing', 'weight', 'training', 'own', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'proper', 'form', 'what', 'order', 'do', 'exercises', 'create', 'most', 'effective', 'routine', 'DVD', 'fixed', '8-minutes', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'long', 'so', 'gave', 'try', 'was', 'sweating', 'puffing', 'move', 'one', 'exercise', 'so', 'quickly', 'rest', 'heart', 'rate', 'alternate', '8-minute', 'buns', 'amp', 'combine', 'Pilates', 'dummies', 'video', '30-minute', 'treadmill', 'walk.I', 'just', 'started', 'routine', 'week', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'far', 'like', 'big', 'thing', 'looking', 'way', 'make', 'exercise', 'apart', 'life', 'taking', 'over', 'life', 'tapes/DVD', 'are', 'way', 'go']",8 Minute Abs & Arms
