Day,"[0, 0]","""Dutch Girls"", This movie begins as an adolescent British schools' field hockey team goes to Holland to play a match, several are hosted by local families who give them room and board.  My Mother enjoyed it especially Colin Firth as Truelove, he is very young and handsome as ever in this movie, as is Timothy Spall as Lyndon, whom my mother tosses her popcorn at the screen when he did some horrible antic.

196133,A2WJCE8VF3STFW,6300128628,Judith,"[2, 2]","This is a cute little movie about a hockey team from a British boys school on a road trip to Amsterdam.  The pompous coach dreams of glory for the school, but the boys just dream of meeting Dutch girls.  This movie is of interest not for the story, but for who is in it.  It's the early work of Colin Firth and James Wilby.  Firth, of course, went on to hearthrob status as Mr. Darcy.  Wilby has made a wonderful career out of starring in high tone Merchant Ivory films like Maurice and brilliant Masterpiece Theater works such as A Tale of Two Cities and Island at War.  Though Firth's become the superstar, it's Wilby who shows more potential in this movie, as he attracts your eye in every scene he is in.Firth plays Neil Truelove, a sensitive, brooding teen.  He spends most of the movie making sad eyes at the camera, and he was really a painfully pretty young man.  Wilby plays Philip Dundine, Truelove's best mate.  Despite being tall and gorgeous, and more outgoing and confident, he's not having any better luck with the Dutch girls than Truelove is.  A third boy is Lyndon, a pig of a lad who romps around in bikini underwear, despite having a body we certainly don't want to see in bikini underwear.  He's the houseguest from Hell to his Dutch host family as he gets drunk and throws up on the carpet, throws food around, brings a bimbo home to have sex with her in the living room, and never flushes the toilet.Although these fellows are supposed to be schoolboys in their teens, they can't quite pull that off.  Firth is still boyishly slender and has a baby face, but still doesn't look like a teenager.  Wilby, despite a teen haircut, has a man's body.  The actor playing Lyndon looks like he's about thirty.One bit of trivia.  The captain of the team is played by Daniel Chatto, who later married the Duke of Kent's daughter, which makes him a fringe member of the British royal family.Though this isn't a great film, it is interesting enough to entertain a viewer, though it probably won't go on anybody's top ten list.  Just a pleasant little bit of fluff made more interesting by the presence of Firth and Wilby.",3,Early work of Firth & Wilby,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,2131,"['cute', 'little', 'movie', 'hockey', 'team', 'British', 'boys', 'school', 'road', 'trip', 'Amsterdam', 'pompous', 'coach', 'dreams', 'glory', 'school', 'boys', 'just', 'dream', 'meeting', 'Dutch', 'girls', 'movie', 'interest', 'not', 'story', 'who', 'early', 'work', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'James', 'Wilby', 'Firth', 'course', 'went', 'hearthrob', 'status', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Wilby', 'made', 'wonderful', 'career', 'starring', 'high', 'tone', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'films', 'Maurice', 'brilliant', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'such', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cities', 'Island', 'War', 'Though', 'Firth', 'become', 'superstar', 'Wilby', 'who', 'more', 'potential', 'movie', 'eye', 'scene', 'in.Firth', 'plays', 'Neil', 'Truelove', 'sensitive', 'brooding', 'teen', 'most', 'movie', 'making', 'sad', 'eyes', 'camera', 'was', 'really', 'painfully', 'pretty', 'young', 'man', 'Wilby', 'Philip', 'Dundine', 'Truelove', 'best', 'mate', 'being', 'tall', 'gorgeous', 'more', 'outgoing', 'confident', 'not', 'having', 'better', 'luck', 'Dutch', 'girls', 'Truelove', 'third', 'boy', 'Lyndon', 'pig', 'lad', 'who', 'romps', 'bikini', 'underwear', 'having', 'body', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'bikini', 'underwear', 'houseguest', 'Hell', 'Dutch', 'host', 'family', 'drunk', 'up', 'carpet', 'food', 'around', 'bimbo', 'home', 'have', 'sex', 'living', 'room', 'never', 'toilet.Although', 'fellows', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'schoolboys', 'teens', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'Firth', 'still', 'boyishly', 'slender', 'baby', 'face', 'still', ""n't"", 'look', 'teenager', 'Wilby', 'teen', 'haircut', 'man', 'body', 'actor', 'playing', 'Lyndon', 'thirty.One', 'bit', 'trivia', 'captain', 'team', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Chatto', 'who', 'later', 'married', 'Duke', 'Kent', 'daughter', 'fringe', 'member', 'British', 'royal', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'interesting', 'enough', 'entertain', 'viewer', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'anybody', 'top', 'ten', 'list', 'Just', 'pleasant', 'little', 'bit', 'fluff', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'presence', 'Firth', 'Wilby']",Dutch Girls VHS

A rather clumsy group of field hockey players from a boys' boarding school get the chance to go play their counterparts in Holland.  They want the adventure of drinking, partying and meeting girls much more than playing their sport.This film is the old story of teenage boys coming of age, so that part is a lot of seen-it-before.It is mostly interesting because of the very young Colin Firth and Timothy Spall, later to become icons of British acting.  Both are very good, as is usually the case with these two very fine actors who, of course, went on to greater performances later in their lives.Firth was around 24 and Spall 27 or 28 when they made this, both playing 17 or 18-year old boys.

196136,A2GPEV42IO41CI,6300128628,Kona,"[0, 0]","Hockey players from a Scottish prep school head to Amsterdam for a tournament and the boys, all big talkers but completely inexperienced, expect to make time with the local girls despite the watchful eye of their nerdy chaperone (Bill Paterson).  Shy Neil (Colin Firth) finds himself attracted to a lovely young blonde while oafish Lyndon (Timothy Spall) turns out to be the Lothario of the group.This 1985 film is mainly a chance to see a very young Colin Firth in action.  While he's not nearly the heartthrob he would later become, he's still sweet and sympathetic.  The action revolves around him, however, and he's often just a spectator.  The spotlight is really shared by Paterson as the hilariously strict yet clueless coach and Spall who is quite convincing as a slovenly rich kid.  James Wilby is also good in a small role.The script doesn't break any new ground, but it's a pleasant, lightweight film about the trials of growing up that will bring a few smiles.",3,You know what they say about Dutch girls,1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,972,"['Hockey', 'players', 'Scottish', 'prep', 'school', 'head', 'Amsterdam', 'tournament', 'boys', 'big', 'talkers', 'completely', 'inexperienced', 'expect', 'make', 'time', 'local', 'girls', 'watchful', 'eye', 'nerdy', 'chaperone', 'Bill', 'Paterson', 'Shy', 'Neil', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'attracted', 'lovely', 'young', 'blonde', 'oafish', 'Lyndon', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'out', 'be', 'Lothario', 'group.This', '1985', 'film', 'mainly', 'chance', 'see', 'very', 'young', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'action', 'not', 'nearly', 'heartthrob', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'still', 'sweet', 'sympathetic', 'action', 'however', 'often', 'just', 'spectator', 'spotlight', 'really', 'shared', 'Paterson', 'hilariously', 'strict', 'yet', 'clueless', 'coach', 'Spall', 'who', 'quite', 'convincing', 'slovenly', 'rich', 'kid', 'James', 'Wilby', 'also', 'good', 'small', 'role.The', 'script', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'pleasant', 'lightweight', 'film', 'trials', 'growing', 'up', 'will', 'bring', 'few', 'smiles']",Dutch Girls VHS
