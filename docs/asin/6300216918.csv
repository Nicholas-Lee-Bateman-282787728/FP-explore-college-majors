I found it nostalgic, and my only  complaint is that all the radios used for the movie were supplied by Radio  Shack (I was hoping to see some old favorites).

And A Wrecker, You have Charles Napier(Trucking Shows Movin' On Tv Series and Bj & the Bear Tv Series,Trucker Movies.) and a Silly even for a Movie plot. If you are looking for CB Action it will not disappoint but Trucking isn't it and the movie to top it all off does not make sense and is boring and long.(reminds me of Smokey and The Hotwire Gang-another CB Type Movie and just as Boring).You have some parts where it seems they just want to make fun of Hillbillies and Of A Priest(A CB Priest).",3,Citizens Band,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,720,"['recently', 'came', 'Netflix', 'instant', 'seeing', 'Rig', 'cover', 'information', 'then', 'sadly', 'disappointment', 'Rig', 'briefly', 'A', 'White', 'Western', 'Star', 'Just', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Movie', 'Steel', 'Cowboy', 'Wrecker', 'have', 'Charles', 'Napier', 'Trucking', 'Shows', 'Movin', 'Tv', 'Series', 'Bj', 'Bear', 'Tv', 'Series', 'Trucker', 'Movies', 'Silly', 'even', 'Movie', 'plot', 'are', 'looking', 'CB', 'Action', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Trucking', ""n't"", 'movie', 'top', 'off', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'boring', 'long', 'Smokey', 'Hotwire', 'Gang-another', 'CB', 'Type', 'Movie', 'just', 'Boring', 'have', 'parts', 'where', 'just', 'want', 'make', 'fun', 'Hillbillies', 'A', 'Priest', 'A', 'CB', 'Priest']",Citizens Band VHS

Before the Internet changed the face of communication and chat rooms took over, we had CB. As this movie shows, you could be anybody behind the CB mic, and reality rarely met the fantasy of the voice on the other end.  You had the good, the bad, and the ugly on CB as this movie shows.",5,"It really was like this...well, almost!",1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,427,"[""'m"", 'just', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'CB', 'radio', 'craze', 'mid', '1970', 'Citizens', 'Band', 'humorous', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'look', 'craze', 'Internet', 'changed', 'face', 'communication', 'chat', 'rooms', 'took', 'over', 'had', 'CB', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'anybody', 'CB', 'mic', 'reality', 'rarely', 'met', 'fantasy', 'voice', 'other', 'end', 'had', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'CB', 'movie']",Citizens Band VHS
