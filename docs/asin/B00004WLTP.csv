Jamie Fox is great and so is Gabrielle Union.The movie is about a man (Jamie) who is dumped by his girlfriend and writes her a letter which in turn becomes a novel.  Everyone loves his book and wants his advise even his cousin and boss.  When trying to help his boss his cousin gets in on the plan yet Quincy (Foxx) doesn't know that his cousin is pretending to be him and that everyone is getting further into the game.  Quincy is falling in love with his cousin's girlfriend which also adds to the mix of things.  This movie is a good comedy and is all about breaking the rules of romance.

Bowles ""DYB""","[9, 9]","Breakin' All The Rules is a mediocre-to-fun movie made more than serviceable by its awesome cast, which include Jamie Foxx, Gabrielle Union, and the gorgeous Morris Chestnut.  Jamie Foxx stars as Quincy, who has been unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend at their engagement party.  When layoffs loom at his job, his boss asks him to research the science of firing employees--and Quincy discovers that the manner in which he was ""fired"" by his girlfriend was all wrong.  Research leads to Quincy penning a runaway bestseller on how to break-up with your lover--chock full of theories tested out by cousin and best friend, Evan (Morris Chestnut).  When Evan suspects that his current girlfriend Nicky (Gabrielle Union)is about to break up with him, he sends his cousin Quincy to plead his case.  Mistaken identity ensues.....and the two become romantically involved.

555768,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00004WLTP,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[3, 4]","To tell the truth, I enjoyed ""Breakin' All the Rules."" It is one of those romantic comedy where nobody knows who anybody else is, and you know that everything is going to be alright at the end. But sometimes that could be alright in the plot is good. That is exactly why this is a good movie. It has a good story, and it has alot of witty dialouge. It isn't a masterpiece, and it's not going to be on my Top 25 of 2004 list at the end of the year, but it is pretty good. Jamie Foxx is the star of the movie, and I never really saw him act before. I never saw his television show, or any of the movies that he made. He was good in this, and that could be a good sign for his next movie ""Collateral"" starring Tom Cruise.Jamie Foxx plays Quincy Watson. He works with his cousin Evan at spoil magazine. Quincy gets a new job from his boss Philip, where he has to fire people. He gets dumped by his girlfriend on that night that he was going to propose to her, and that causes him to quit his job, because he realizes that getting dumped and firing people are one of the same. He insteads writes a book. A break-up handbook on how to do it, when to do it, where to do it, why to do it, etc. It is a bestseller, number one of the list, and soon he is being asked by Philip on how to break up with his girlfriend Rita, who married people for their money. Even then gets the idea that his girlfriend Nicky is about to break up with him, so he decides to have Quincy go to a specific place, and talk to her about him. He has never met her, and she got a haircut from the last time Even saw her, making her look like Halle Berry. Quincy talks to her, thinking she's somebody else, and the two start a relationship of some sort. Rita then finds out that Quincy is helping Philip break up with her, and she goes to his house, but finds Even there. She sleeps with Even thinking he's Quincy, in order to have him stop helping Philip, and the case of mistaken identies grows deeper.There are so many movies that have the case of mistaken identity, but some how ""Breakin' All the Rules"" pulls it off. In the beginning, once Quincy writes his book, you get to hear lines from it, and advice from him. It is interesting to hear things like this, and the movie is filled with witty dialouge like this from start to end. ""Breakin' All the Rules"" was not a big hit at the box office, and it is just about out of theatres, but it is a sure fire hit on DVD. It was better seeing it in a movie theatre in front of an audience, but I wish  that more formula comedies that come out are half as good as this was.
