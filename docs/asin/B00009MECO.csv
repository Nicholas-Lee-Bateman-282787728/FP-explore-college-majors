754433,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00009MECO,D. S. Thurlow,"[2, 2]","2001's ""A Great Deliverance"" is the superb two-part pilot for BBC/PBS's Inspector Lynley Mysteries.  Like any good pilot episode, much screen time is devoted to introducing the cast, but ""A Great Deliverance"" manages a gruesome, twisting murder mystery into the bargain.Inspector Thomas Lynley is an up-and-coming detective at Scotland Yard; he is also an aristocrat, well-educated, well-heeled, and resented by his less fortunate fellow police.  As the story opens, he has just had the emotionally trying experience of standing best man for his friend Simon, who marries a woman with whom Lynley himself was in love.Sergeant Barbara Havers is single, working class, rumpled, and resentful, but a good cop nonetheless.  Her cross to bear is two aging parents who need more care than she can provide.  She and Lynley are put on a rural Yorkshire murder case in a partnership their bosses hope will drive one or both out of service.The murder itself is complicated.  A parish priest finds a parishioner dead, beheaded in his own barn on top of the corpse of his dog, with his young daughter sitting by, stricken mute with horror.  Lynley and Havers must weed out a sizeable cast of suspects without much cooperation from the local police.  They must also deal with their respective personal baggage.  Out of the challenge comes the beginnings of a wonderful partnership, as Lynley and Havers discover respect and loyalty in each other and begin to create the nicely nuanced relationship that is the heart of this long-running series.The episode was shot on location in Yorkshire, with a generous landscape and a variety of farmhouses and inns as settings.  The dialogue is crisp.  The audience gets the clues, and the red herrings, at the same rate as the detectives.  The story holds most of its secrets nearly to the end.  ""A Great Deliverance"" is very highly recommended to fans of the Inspector Lynley Mysteries as the one that started it all.",5,The Beginnings of a Wonderful Partnership....,1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,1945,"['2001', 'A', 'Great', 'Deliverance', 'superb', 'two-part', 'pilot', 'BBC/PBS', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries', 'good', 'pilot', 'episode', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'devoted', 'introducing', 'cast', 'A', 'Great', 'Deliverance', 'gruesome', 'twisting', 'murder', 'mystery', 'bargain.Inspector', 'Thomas', 'Lynley', 'up-and-coming', 'detective', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'also', 'aristocrat', 'well-educated', 'well-heeled', 'resented', 'less', 'fortunate', 'fellow', 'police', 'story', 'just', 'had', 'emotionally', 'trying', 'experience', 'standing', 'best', 'man', 'friend', 'Simon', 'who', 'woman', 'whom', 'Lynley', 'was', 'love.Sergeant', 'Barbara', 'Havers', 'single', 'working', 'class', 'rumpled', 'resentful', 'good', 'cop', 'nonetheless', 'cross', 'bear', 'two', 'aging', 'parents', 'who', 'need', 'more', 'care', 'can', 'provide', 'Lynley', 'are', 'put', 'rural', 'Yorkshire', 'murder', 'case', 'partnership', 'bosses', 'hope', 'will', 'drive', 'one', 'service.The', 'murder', 'complicated', 'parish', 'priest', 'parishioner', 'dead', 'beheaded', 'own', 'barn', 'top', 'corpse', 'dog', 'young', 'daughter', 'sitting', 'stricken', 'mute', 'horror', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'must', 'weed', 'out', 'sizeable', 'cast', 'suspects', 'much', 'cooperation', 'local', 'police', 'must', 'also', 'deal', 'respective', 'personal', 'baggage', 'challenge', 'beginnings', 'wonderful', 'partnership', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'discover', 'respect', 'loyalty', 'other', 'begin', 'create', 'nicely', 'nuanced', 'relationship', 'heart', 'long-running', 'series.The', 'episode', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Yorkshire', 'generous', 'landscape', 'variety', 'farmhouses', 'inns', 'settings', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'audience', 'clues', 'red', 'herrings', 'same', 'rate', 'detectives', 'story', 'most', 'secrets', 'nearly', 'end', 'Great', 'Deliverance', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries', 'one', 'started']",N/A

They did change the ending somewhat but what was written in the book was so horrible that I don't see how they could have put it on film.  The substitution wasn't as powerful but it served it's purpose.  Without giving away the ending and the guilty person I can't say more.  In this first episode of the series, Helen was played by a different person than the one I had seen in one of the later episodes on t.v.  This actress portraying Helen was much nearer the way she is described in the books.  Deborah is a lovely little woman and St. James is well cast except that they don't include the fact that he is lame. The actress playing Havers is much too attractive but does a wonderful job of portraying Havers' personality, her insecurities, her intelligence and her attitude toward Lynley.  There are many scenes of the beauty of Yorkshire and one gets a real feeling about the people who live there.  I thought it was surprisingly well done, does not drag as many British films do and manages to get most of the story into the film. One thing they totally left out is what had happened to Tessa's husband.  When they interviewed her she was distraught because he had not come home.  The book explains this at the end but it is not mentioned in the film.

754438,A14JINVAL1QY5N,B00009MECO,"lydia03 ""lydia03""","[50, 52]","When the powers that be at Scotland Yard assign Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers to a particularly high-profile murder investigation, they create the oddest couple since Neil Simon's Felix Unger and Oscar Madison.  Lynley is the Oxford-educated, Eighth Earl of Asherton, with an upscale London town house and a country estate down in Cornwall.  Havers, who has in the past alternatively referred to Lynley as ""that fast-track Oxford golden-boy"" or ""that arrogant, aristocratic ponce"", lives in a council-house with her aging and infirmed parents, and carries around a chip on her shoulder the size of Rock of Gibraltar.As the story begins, ""The Yard"" has been called in by the Yorkshire police on a particularly nasty case - a farmer has been found brutally murdered in his barn along with his sheep dog; his traumatized sixteen-year old daughter is found mute, unable to tell investigators what has occurred.  To make matters worse, allegations of local police corruption have just surfaced.This is not going to be an easy case, especially as Lynley and Havers arrive on the scene in Yorkshire each encumbered with a steamer trunk full of emotional baggage.Lynley has just been the Best Man at the wedding of the love of his life, Deborah, to his best friend Simon St. James.  Upon arriving in Yorkshire, he finds that one of the local police officers assigned to work with him is one Sergeant Nies, whom he'd previously had a run-in with and Nies is still nursing a grudge against him.  As if these problems weren't daunting enough, Lynley has to deal with Havers.Havers, who has a well deserved reputation at the Yard of being difficult to work with, resents Lynley for being rich, well-educated, well-connected, handsome and charming - in short, everything she isn't.  Her obvious resentment of Lynley becomes so tiresome, that at one point, he stops the car in the middle of the road one evening and says, ""You are exhausting, you are permanently on the defensive.""  Later, he exclaims, ""take away your prejudices and who's Barbara Havers?""  Havers, however, does have some very real problems to deal with; while Lynley is trying to cope with his loss of Deborah, Havers is spending every spare moment on the phone trying to get help from Social Services for her parents - a father in the last stages of emphysema and a mother suffering from what appears to Alzheimer's.Yet in spite of their personal problems, Lynley and Havers quickly get down to the business of investigating the murder.  That they do so - in the face of local police hostility and foot-dragging, witnesses who tell them only half-truths, plus a few red herrings thrown in along the way - is a testament to their skill and professionalism.This BBC production of ""A Great Deliverance"", based on the book by Elizabeth George, is well adapted and perfectly cast.  Some Elizabeth George fans may object to casting a dark haired actor in the role of Lynley, whom George conceived of as a blonde, but that's a trivial issue.  First, actors frequently bare little physical resemblance to the authors' original descriptions of the characters they play - case in point, P.D. James' Adam Dalgleish.  James always described Dalgleish as ""dark"", something Roy Marsden isn't.  Second, if you're casting about today for a tall, good looking, ""upper class"" British actor for a role - Nathaniel Parker is the natural choice.  Parker casually combines class with masculinity.  He also possesses one of the best speaking voices of any English-speaking actor today.  His lines are always delivered clearly, but effortlessly, in that rich, mellow baritone of his.  In a television career of more than a dozen years - ""Piece of Cake"", ""Never Come Back"", ""Vanity Fair"" and ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" - Parker has displayed great versatility.  Having appeared in episodes of ""Inspector Morse"" and ""Poirot"" he's also no stranger to ""Mystery"" audiences.  As Lynley, he projects authority, integrity, vulnerability; plus genuine warmth and tenderness when visiting the victim's youngest daughter - Roberta Tey - at a psychiatric hospital.Like Parker's Lynley, Sharon Small's Barbara Havers differs in appearance from the character created by George.  George's creation was short, dumpy and dressed in Oxfam rejects - one doubts if too many actresses would have been beating down the doors to play the character as originally envisioned.  Small retains Havers' abrasiveness, but through her attempts at dealing with the problems in her private life, she succeeds in making Barbara a more sympathetic character.One of the traditional strengths of British TV imports is the careful attention the British pay to the casting of each role.  ""A Great Deliverance"" is no exception.  In addition to the two strong leads, ""A Great Deliverance"" is graced with a great supporting cast.  Anthony Calf and Amanda Ryan play newly weds Simon and Deborah St. James brilliantly - capturing the romance of a newly wed couple and the awkwardness created by their relationship with Lynley and the anguish they know he is going through.  Emma Fielding is perfect as Helen Clyde - so perfect - that one wonders why the producers subsequently replaced her in later episodes.  Brendan Coyle (Richard Tey) - with his dark good looks and earthy masculinity - is a perfect counterweight to Parker's Lynley.  But the real acting honors go to Rebecca Gallacher as Roberta Tey - so eloquent in her silence.To sum up, while this BBC-WGBH production of Elizabeth George's ""A Great Deliverance"" does not follow the book to the letter, it does capture the essence of this excellent mystery. I highly recommend ""A Great Deliverance"" to lovers of good, old-fashioned British mysteries.",5,A Great Deliverance -- A great adaptation,1068854400,"11 15, 2003",2003,5738,"['When', 'powers', 'be',

Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","And so begins one of the greatest partnerships in police procedural dramas.A Yorkshire farmer is found beheaded in his barn, his blood-stained daughter sitting catatonically beside him, staring into nothing. Once she's been whisked to a psychiatric ward, the police-force decide to put aristocratic, educated, sophisticated Inspector Thomas Lynley and scruffy, antagonistic, working-class Sergeant Barbara Havers on the case, hoping to kill two birds with one stone. Lynley is unpopular in Yorkshire due to him dobbing in a corrupt inspector, and Havers is bound to give him a hard time over it - what better way to make the two of them self-destruct than force them to work together?Yet the combination of his charm and her instincts leads to an unexpectedly complimentary partnership. In a small town that's full of secrets, the duo find ways to wheedle, coax, threaten and demand information from the close-lipped locals, as well as stand up to the area's openly hostile police force.To say they've both got personal problems is an understatement. Havers struggles with elderly parents suffering from dementia, whilst Lynley has just watched his best friend marry the woman he's still in love with. In a case that involves a lovelorn teenager with mental issues, they can't help but project their issues onto their investigation. Yet in grappling with their personal baggage, the two find themselves supporting each other in unexpected ways (when they're not griping at each other, that is).Divided across two ninety-minute episodes, ""A Great Deliverance"" serves as an introduction to Lynley and Havers as well as a complex mystery in its own right. Not quite a ""cozy"" mystery, as the subject matter and tone is rather too bleak for that, but a crime with the requisite red herrings, range of suspects, and psychological profiling. There are some amusing glimpses back into the early 2000s, what with the giant laptops and cell-phones, as well as a couple of familiar faces (Brendan Coyle is now probably best known as Mr Bates onDownton Abbey).Based on the books by Elizabeth George, Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small may not be a perfect physical match for Lynley and Havers, but capture the spirit of the characters to perfection. Parker's Lynley is well-spoken, fair-minded, and clearly the product of an Oxford education, whilst Small's Havers is short-tempered, quick-tongued and lower class.Yet what they both have in common is a strong sense of justice and a desire to protect the vulnerable; a shared trait that forms the basis of the relationship that becomes the heart of the show. Parker and Small have had plenty of roles over the course of their separate careers, but I think there can be no doubt that Lynley and Havers will be their defining roles.This two-parter is the pilot episode of ""The Inspector Lynley Mysteries"", though you're probably better off either buyingthe first season(which includes these episodes) or gettingthe boxed setof the show in its entirety.",5,"""Tonight Can We Pretend to Like Each Other?""",1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,2987,"['so', 'one', 'greatest', 'partnerships', 'police', 'procedural', 'dramas.A', 'Yorkshire', 'farmer', 'found', 'beheaded', 'barn', 'blood-stained', 'daughter', 'sitting', 'catatonically', 'beside', 'staring', 'nothing', 'been', 'whisked', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'police-force', 'decide', 'put', 'aristocratic', 'educated', 'sophisticated', 'Inspector', 'Thomas', 'Lynley', 'scruffy', 'antagonistic', 'working-class', 'Sergeant', 'Barbara', 'Havers', 'case', 'hoping', 'kill', 'two', 'birds', 'one', 'stone', 'Lynley', 'unpopular', 'Yorkshire', 'due', 'dobbing', 'corrupt', 'inspector', 'Havers', 'bound', 'give', 'hard', 'time', 'what', 'better', 'way', 'make', 'two', 'self-destruct', 'force', 'work', 'together', 'combination', 'charm', 'instincts', 'unexpectedly', 'complimentary', 'partnership', 'small', 'town', 'full', 'secrets', 'duo', 'find', 'ways', 'wheedle', 'coax', 'threaten', 'demand', 'information', 'close-lipped', 'locals', 'as', 'well', 'stand', 'area', 'openly', 'hostile', 'police', 'force.To', 'say', ""'ve"", 'got', 'personal', 'problems', 'understatement', 'Havers', 'elderly', 'parents', 'suffering', 'dementia', 'whilst', 'Lynley', 'just', 'watched', 'best', 'friend', 'woman', 'still', 'love', 'case', 'lovelorn', 'teenager', 'mental', 'issues', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'project', 'issues', 'investigation', 'grappling', 'personal', 'baggage', 'two', 'find', 'supporting', 'other', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'griping', 'other', '.Divided', 'two', 'ninety-minute', 'episodes', 'Great', 'Deliverance', 'serves', 'introduction', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'as', 'well', 'complex', 'mystery', 'own', 'right', 'Not', 'quite', 'cozy', 'mystery', 'subject', 'matter', 'tone', 'rather', 'too', 'bleak', 'crime', 'requisite', 'red', 'herrings', 'range', 'suspects', 'psychological', 'profiling', 'are', 'amusing', 'glimpses', 'back', 'early', '2000s', 'what', 'giant', 'laptops', 'cell-phones', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'familiar', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'now', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'Mr', 'Bates', 'onDownton', 'Abbey', '.Based', 'books', 'Elizabeth', 'George', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'physical', 'match', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'capture', 'spirit', 'characters', 'perfection', 'Parker', 'Lynley', 'well-spoken', 'fair-minded', 'clearly', 'product', 'Oxford', 'education', 'whilst', 'Small', 'Havers', 'short-tempered', 'quick-tongued', 'lower', 'class.Yet', 'what', 'have', 'common', 'strong', 'sense', 'justice', 'desire', 'protect', 'vulnerable', 'shared', 'trait', 'basis', 'relationship', 'heart', 'show', 'Parker', 'Small', 'have', 'had', 'plenty', 'roles', 'course', 'separate', 'careers', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'doubt', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'will', 'be', 'defining', 'roles.This', 'two-parter', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries', ""'re"", 'probably', 'better', 'off', 'buyingthe', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'gettingthe', 'boxed', 'setof', 'show', 'entirety']",N/A

But 2 stars for other details, which is why an overall 3 stars is earned.  The first pairing of the detecting duo finds them mismatched and Lynley desperately trying to work his way around the insecure Havers' many character speed bumps.  Lynley gets kudos for his patience and forebearance, especially when he's interacting with former members of his squad who bear him immense ill will.  But Lynley is no pushover, would probably make an effective head of state, as his strength of character never varies.  And Havers is brought to heel, so she isn't running amok in their later adventures.  You can see the growth of their relationship in this first part.  But the mystery itself isn't engaging to me, only the interaction of the main characters.  A lot of modern Brit mystery is tawdry and lurid and even repulsive, unlike previous ""cozy mystery"" decades, in the vein of Dame Agatha, for example, with a country village and a smooth poisoning.  Lynley is an example of the modern Brit mystery, though it is written by an American.  One other puzzling bit, for viewers of the later episodes, is the Helen featured here by a charming and attractive actress is unfortunately replaced later by one who is rather plain and also missing the sense of humor and compassion that lay within first Helen.  With the new Helen, I keep wondering what Lynley sees in her (his bride) whereas the first Helen raised no such questions.",3,Speed Bumps,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,1533,"['give', '4', 'stars', 'sophistication', 'lack', 'u.s.', 'inevitable', 'romance', 'main', 'characters', '2', 'stars', 'other', 'details', 'why', 'overall', '3', 'stars', 'earned', 'first', 'pairing', 'detecting', 'duo', 'mismatched', 'Lynley', 'desperately', 'trying', 'work', 'way', 'insecure', 'Havers', 'many', 'character', 'speed', 'bumps', 'Lynley', 'kudos', 'patience', 'forebearance', 'especially', 'when', 'interacting', 'former', 'members', 'squad', 'who', 'bear', 'immense', 'ill', 'will', 'Lynley', 'pushover', 'would', 'probably', 'make', 'effective', 'head', 'state', 'strength', 'character', 'never', 'varies', 'Havers', 'brought', 'heel', ""n't"", 'running', 'amok', 'later', 'adventures', 'can', 'see', 'growth', 'relationship', 'first', 'part', 'mystery', ""n't"", 'engaging', 'only', 'interaction', 'main', 'characters', 'lot', 'modern', 'Brit', 'mystery', 'tawdry', 'lurid', 'even', 'repulsive', 'previous', 'cozy', 'mystery', 'decades', 'vein', 'Dame', 'Agatha', 'example', 'country', 'village', 'smooth', 'poisoning', 'Lynley', 'example', 'modern', 'Brit', 'mystery', 'written', 'American', 'One', 'other', 'puzzling', 'bit', 'viewers', 'later', 'episodes', 'Helen', 'featured', 'here', 'charming', 'attractive', 'actress', 'unfortunately', 'replaced', 'later', 'one', 'who', 'rather', 'plain', 'also', 'missing', 'sense', 'humor', 'compassion', 'lay', 'first', 'Helen', 'new', 'Helen', 'keep', 'wondering', 'what', 'Lynley', 'bride', 'first', 'Helen', 'raised', 'such', 'questions']",N/A

They make a good crime solving pair in this English cozy who-done-it?The DVD is three hours long, but time passes quickly as the pair move to solve the mysterious death of a farmer. His teenage daughter, now in shock, was found by his side, as well as the dog, murdered and underneath the farmer. There are lots of suspects including the nephew that is expecting to inherit his uncle's farm. So, who killed the farmer? Why is the teenage daugther not talking? Did she do it or is she merely in shock from her father's death? Did she witness the murder? There is a shrine in the farmer's home to a woman named Tessa. Who is she? Where does she fit in all this? Is she the girl's mother? What happened to her? As, if that isn't enough the pair discover that there is another daughter, but where is she? Twists and turns galore will keep you guessing until the end and just when you think you have it solved, you probably don't have it accurately concluded.
