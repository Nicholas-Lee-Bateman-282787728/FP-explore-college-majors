806109,A3RQB2W820QCZA,B0001I2BZ8,Joey F. Kolber,"[5, 8]","Not too bad of a movie, but I was expecting more. I was dissapointed to just see some rehashing of CG's with some added, new CG from a game that came out a few years ago. Being a Galerians fan though, I was joyed to see a movie created of it. Though, something original would have been better I think. The action scenes were excellent, if not a little fast paced. I think any other person watching this would find it a major disappointment, so it's definately a fan film. The animation isn't too bad, but seems a tad bit outdated. The story retains itself 100%, which in my opinion is a bad thing because there was really nothing original about this movie. And for it's price, I really wish I could have gotten more out of it. But, what can you expect from a movie that has the main selling point being it's soundtrack (which I didn't hear in the movie, because I retained the original japense). Oh well, it was good for what it was, and despite it's pace being too quick, with editing that was way to fast to enjoy entirely, the action scenes made this fan of both galerians and psychic type powers a happy camper.",3,Not too bad,1081900800,"04 14, 2004",2004,1115,"['Not', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'just', 'see', 'rehashing', 'CG', 'added', 'new', 'CG', 'game', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Being', 'Galerians', 'fan', 'was', 'joyed', 'see', 'movie', 'created', 'Though', 'something', 'original', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'think', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'excellent', 'not', 'little', 'fast', 'paced', 'think', 'other', 'person', 'watching', 'would', 'find', 'major', 'disappointment', 'definately', 'fan', 'film', 'animation', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'tad', 'bit', 'outdated', 'story', '100', '%', 'opinion', 'bad', 'thing', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'original', 'movie', 'price', 'really', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'movie', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'being', 'soundtrack', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'movie', 'retained', 'original', 'japense', 'Oh', 'well', 'was', 'good', 'what', 'was', 'pace', 'being', 'too', 'quick', 'editing', 'was', 'way', 'fast', 'enjoy', 'entirely', 'action', 'scenes', 'made', 'fan', 'galerians', 'psychic', 'type', 'powers', 'happy', 'camper']",N/A

806111,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B0001I2BZ8,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[0, 0]","I'm coming at this movie based on the fact I never played or even heard of the video game. So take my comments from this background. Gallerians: Rion is a weak film that seems to borrow ideas from several more popular sources like Akira, Terminator, Firestarter, and all sorts of anime films made previously. The production values aren't really strong, which in of itself is forgiveable. Only this stands out more with a weak, cookie cutter script with weak plot development. I hear most of the movis is just video game footage and that does explain the way it's layed out. However I am writing this review as somebody who didn't play the game and is just here to watch a movie. In the end it seems the only ones who will appreciate this film the most are those familiar with the game it's based on and mabye manga readers.Lets start with the story, as derivative as it is. Some kid who was experimented on turns on his handlers. That the gist of the introductory premise and it wreaks of copycatting scenes from the movie Akira to the point of plagiarism. This kid, Rion, is so full of this amazing power all he has to do is scream and things blow up or ignite in a blaze of destruction. Later in the movie you find out there is more happening with some uberpowerful machine tied to it all. What that really means is our hero Rion faces a new ""boss"" enemy every few scenes in a effort to ""out-scream"" them into defeat.Now there is an effort to make these villains multidimensional, however it seems this happens way too late in their time in the story and as quickly as learned what's up with them they are gone. For instance at the beginning the movie introduces what seems to be the big boss of the organization that created Rion in the first place, but he ends up just being a chapter in this story. Just another ""boss"" battle to get through.This is apparently a low bugdet production with the computer animation not being fully up to par with what was being released at that time. It's not horrible, but you can definitely tell the limitations with the lack of things like motion capture movement for the characters, dynamic lighting effects beyond the most pedestrian levels, and limited environmental effects. I'm not one to really harp on this sort of thing, but since the story was so weak the animation is only that much more noticeable.The DVD is pretty much a standard release with no special features other than a trailer of the film that was so disorienting and chopped up I wouldn't be surprised if it drove people AWAY from wanting to see this. The audio options are a bit strange. Of course you have the original audio with subtitles in English, Spanish, French and German. No problem there. If you are into dubbed films things get interesting. There is an original two channel audio and then there is the ""new"" 5.1 surround mix. Usually a new mix means improved but that is not the case here. Many of the audio queues from the original audio are no longer there. That means you will get portions of the movie where you se a lot going on and there SHOULD be something to hear along with that and there isn't. It seems the ""new"" surround only adds a few sound effects that utilize the surround speakers along with an edgier music soundtrack. If you ask me it's not worth it. Dub viewers should just stick with the stereo track.Gallerions: Rion isn't for those of you looking for some depth and story. It's for fans of the game or fans of the type of anime that are more boss fights than anything else (like the Dragonball series). If you're curious rent it, but otherwise you aren't missing anything not seeing this film.",2,Woefully derivative,1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,3637,"[""'m"", 'coming', 'movie', 'based', 'fact', 'never', 'played', 'even', 'heard', 'video', 'game', 'So', 'take', 'comments', 'background', 'Gallerians', 'Rion', 'weak', 'film', 'borrow', 'ideas', 'several', 'more', 'popular', 'sources', 'Akira', 'Terminator', 'Firestarter', 'sorts', 'anime', 'films', 'made', 'previously', 'production', 'values', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'strong', 'forgiveable', 'Only', 'out', 'more', 'weak', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'script', 'weak', 'plot', 'development', 'hear', 'most', 'movis', 'just', 'video', 'game', 'footage', 'explain', 'way', 'layed', 'out', 'However', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'somebody', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'game', 'just', 'here', 'watch', 'movie', 'end', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'will', 'appreciate', 'film', 'most', 'are', 'familiar', 'game', 'based', 'mabye', 'manga', 'readers.Lets', 'start', 'story', 'as', 'derivative', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'experimented', 'turns', 'handlers', 'gist', 'introductory', 'premise', 'copycatting', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Akira', 'point', 'plagiarism', 'kid', 'Rion', 'so', 'full', 'amazing', 'power', 'do', 'scream', 'things', 'blow', 'up', 'ignite', 'blaze', 'destruction', 'Later', 'movie', 'find', 'more', 'happening', 'uberpowerful', 'machine', 'tied', 'What', 'really', 'hero', 'Rion', 'new', 'boss', 'enemy', 'few', 'scenes', 'effort', 'out-scream', 'defeat.Now', 'effort', 'make', 'villains', 'multidimensional', 'however', 'way', 'too', 'late', 'time', 'story', 'as', 'quickly', 'learned', 'what', 'up', 'are', 'gone', 'instance', 'beginning', 'movie', 'what', 'be', 'big', 'boss', 'organization', 'created', 'Rion', 'first', 'place', 'up', 'just', 'being', 'chapter', 'story', 'Just', 'boss', 'battle', 'get', 'through.This', 'apparently', 'low', 'bugdet', 'production', 'computer', 'animation', 'not', 'being', 'fully', 'up', 'par', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'time', 'not', 'horrible', 'can', 'definitely', 'tell', 'limitations', 'lack', 'things', 'motion', 'capture', 'movement', 'characters', 'dynamic', 'lighting', 'effects', 'most', 'pedestrian', 'levels', 'limited', 'environmental', 'effects', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'really', 'harp', 'sort', 'thing', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'weak', 'animation', 'only', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'noticeable.The', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'release', 'special', 'other', 'trailer', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'disorienting', 'chopped', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'drove', 'people', 'AWAY', 'wanting', 'see', 'audio', 'options', 'are', 'bit', 'strange', 'course', 'have', 'original', 'audio', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'German', 'problem', 'there', 'are', 'dubbed', 'films', 'things', 'get', 'interesting', 'original', 'two', 'channel', 'audio', 'then', 'new', '5.1', 'surround', 'mix', 'Usually', 'new', 'mix', 'improved', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'Many', 'audio', 'queues', 'original', 'audio', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'there', 'will', 'get', 'portions', 'movie', 'where', 'se', 'lot', 'going', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'something', 'hear', ""n't"", 'new', 'surround', 'only', 'few', 'sound', 'effects', 'utilize', 'surround', 'speakers', 'edgier', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'ask', 'not', 'worth', 'Dub', 'viewers', 'should', 'just', 'stick', 'stereo', 'track.Gallerions', 'Rion', ""n't"", 'looking', 'depth', 'story', 'fans', 'game', 'fans', 'type', 'anime', 'are', 'more', 'fights', 'anything', 'else', 'Dragonball', 'series', ""'re"", 'curious', 'rent', 'otherwise', 'are', ""n't"", 'missing', 'anything', 'not', 'seeing', 'film']",N/A
