The line up/songs  were great. the camera work (as someone else said) could use some help..but this is also true on the aladdin dvd as well(what happened to the lady that used to always film his live shows (as well as the unreleased videos)But, overall any chance to see prince perform is always gonna be worth your money. a 'bad' prince song is till decades ahead of the best songs you hear on the radio these days. I just wish he would release more shows like this. Musicology or the hit and run tour come to mine. But that's just me wanting and wishing. I would highly recommend this dvd.

The quality of their music is greater than the sounds of their songs.  Rave Un2 The Year 2000 is by far one the best yet and many more to come.

1150948,AVYHWCIW5LNAX,B0015UKX7E,"M. Mariba ""the teacher""","[7, 7]","It's a great celebration party in 1999 at Paisley Park Studios, Prince playing ""1999"" for the last time! Prince is now a fully devoted Jehovah's witness, his usual sexual overtures are a bit toned down, in ""Get Off"" : it's 23 prescriptions in a one-night stand instead of 23 positions in a one-night stand, song being from CD ""Diamonds And Pearls"" and the song ""The Cross"" from CD ""Sign O' The Times"" becomes ""The Christ"" . Prince is however magnificent  in guitar & everything else he does, but more concetration on his own music would have made the release even much better (instead of the music of The Time/Lenny Kravitz/George Clinton/Larry Graham/etc). I thought CD ""Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic"" (RUTJF) would be well represented as Prince plays the song ""1999"" for the last time & promoting his new album RUTJF! Only two songs ""Greatest Romance"" & ""Baby Knows"" are from RUTJF. Despite these criticisms, Prince is Prince, he really knows how to party like it's 1999 & can present music (his own or others) in ways very few musicians would match! Great release by His Royal Purple Highness supported by great musicians like Lenny Kravitz, Rosie Gaines, Maceo Parker, The Time & many others.

This dvd is simply awesome! Real music played by true musicians! It's really like being right there as Prince, Larry Graham, Lenny Kravitz and Maceo share their unrestrained on stage ""jam session"" with everyone! Don't buy it if you prefer lip synching or guitar smashing because this dvd includes true performers!!!! They are actually about real music....instumentally and vocally. Ol' school performances are extremely rare now a days. Therefore, this is definetly one for collectors! As a side comment, I must say that Prince, Morris Day and Jerome look the same as they did 16 years prior to this taping, in the 1984 'Purple Rain' movie!
