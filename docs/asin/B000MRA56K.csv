Did he lack the courage of his convictions?  The performance itself, running barely forty-five minutes, is barely long enough for a prime-time TV nugget.  It's a shame one of comedy's most recognizable stylists only cuts a performance video once every twenty years, and then cuts it short.Then, after the performance, he hits us with a free-form film about a disillusioned Civil War soldier facing his own imminent death.  Though it starts with an interesting premise colored by Wright's unique dry humor, it loops back and forth, sprawling all over the joint.  Wright hits some important laughs and insights at key moments, but I spent most of the film thinking, ""Wow, this goes on a bit, doesn't it?""This video isn't bad.  I laughed at the right places in Wright's performance, and I even thought the tailing film had many good moments.  But it simply lacked ambition.  Few performers today command the instantaneous recognition we get these days with Steven Wright, and he did only as much as we expected, nothing more.

By the time it was over, my sides hurt.The short film ""One Soldier"" is another animal altogether.  At first, it appears to be an obvious parody of art-house cinema from Federico Fellini to Jim Jarmusch (with Jarmusch's ""Dead Man"" being an obvious influence), but as it progresses, it darkens, until by the end, you're left somewhat shellshocked by Wright's seemingly bleak, almost nihilistic, and deeply disturbing worldview.  Avoid watching it if you're remotely depressed.As for the early material, it was good but disappointingly short.  Someone else mentioned the wealth of classic Wright material out there, and why none of it has made its way to DVD is a mystery.  I've got the Comic Relief shows, and his sets are always among the highlights.

His act includes some of his signature koan-like observations. ""I'm addicted to placebos. How can I tell when I've kicked the habit?""The audience's laughter is sometimes so explosive, it blasts away Wright's subsequent one-liner. However, most of his brilliance comes through.The next section consists of a short film that Wright wrote and co-directed. I thought it was going to be a parody of some somber, sepia documentary, such as Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" series. Although there might be traces of parody here, I eventually realized that ""When the Leaves Blow Away"" was generally meant as a serious reflection on life and death. It ends up being fairly poignant, but a bit misplaced amid the viewer's expectation of comedy.Finally, there is a clip of one of Wright's early stand-up performances. This is just a snippet lasting only about two minutes.So the main value of this DVD is in its first section.
