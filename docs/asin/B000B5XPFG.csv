936310,A3R4I4S093VB1K,B000B5XPFG,"Appliance & Kitchen Fan ""happy housewife""","[90, 91]","This is my 2nd review of this DVD.Now that I've been doing it a while I felt I could make an even better assessment.All the abs workouts on this DVD are about 8 to 9 minutes long.Mostly I am sticking with the Bootcamp Abs part of it, I have done a couple of the other workouts on it, but my abs desperately need Bootcamp Abs!The instructor, Meghan White, is a very popular instructor and mostly releases dvds through Bodywise Media.You start from the first second your hand lets go of your remote!  Meghan leads you through several repetitions of crunches and tells you to breathe.  She does several incarnations of these crunches, 1 leg up, 1 down.  Leg in, leg out.  Other side.After doing those she starts working on your lower abs (which are my big problem area).  You are on your back.  Legs in the air.  Hands on your back.  Hips up, hips down.  Several repetitions of this.  You feel that you can't go on, but you do because she is doing the counting, and the music is perfect for this.Then you've done those, and smaller ones with legs in the air.  Next, your legs are bent at the knee, still in the air, you're doing crunches.  You really feel that you can't go on, but you do.  Meghan is counting, so you know you can hang in there and go on.  ""4, 3, 2, 1..."".A couple of different ones of those, and you did it!  You can do it!  It's only 9 minutes, but it's so hard!  This is great and challenging!Meghan White is the best instructor there is.EDIT: December 5, 2009:Well, I haven't done this for a while, but once again I am doing it again.  I am seeing a difference in my abs.  I am doing the top 2 sets (one is Bootcamp Abs, the other is Kickboxing Abs).  I tried the Challenge Abs set and that is too much for me.  I do one set a day and go between the two of the sets I just mentioned, and I do it in the morning right after I feed the cats.  Is it making a difference?  I believe it is.  You don't want to know how bad my abs are.  Let's just say the fat hangs DOWN, now it's a little bit less hanging down..know what I mean?  I had to work up to doing this every day.  First I started with every other day because it was too much for me.  An added bonus is that since I have IBS-C this has been helping me with that problem.  Amazing!Edit:  February 5, 2014Am working with this - AGAIN.  Life happens!  So, I am taking weekly selfies and posting the pix on a private unseen photo account and have been doing this for 2 days.  The LOWER ABS are shrinking.  I've only been doing this for 2 days (along with a lot of other exercises) & cal counting, and I can see that it's working AGAIN.  I hope that this time I can commit to weight loss the entire way through.  Will again update in a few months. :)",5,Another winner for Meghan White!

936322,A33YMTWRDJQ29I,B000B5XPFG,John W. Gilbert,"[3, 3]","A little bit about me:  42yr, 6ft, 195lb and very fit.  Been doing P90X for the last 120 days or so and still going strong with that.  It also has a great abs workout in it, but very different from this one I'm reviewing here.  I now do my P90X routine and on days when it's ab workout time (it's about 17minutes), I'll follow it up with 2 or 3 of the short videos from 'Perfect Abs'.  This gives me about 1/2hr on abs total and I will feel it for a while!  Now for my review of 'Perfect Abs'.A better title for this DVD would be, ""Perfect Crunches"".  There are 8 videos, each about 7-9 minutes long.  No messing around, no breaks...just simply banging out an assortment of crunches...most of which you probably haven't seen before.  And they are effective.  A little focus on obliques now and then, but not much.  You can do all of this sitting in front of your t.v. lying in one spot which is nice I suppose.The bad:  not much really, and I'm nitpicking to be sure.  The title is a little misleading-I was expecting a more 'thorough' abs workout...various hanging knee raises, bicycles, side rises, etc.  If it was called 'Perfect Crunches' then I'd be giving it a thumbs up with 5 stars with rave reviews.  The woman is a little annoying with her voice, so turn it down where you can barely hear her. For some reason I find her completely unattractive.  I'm sure the females reading this will tear me up for writing that, but I do think a better looking person leading the video would help motivate.  She gives this evil little stare now and then at the camera.  My wife usually cracks up when she does that and says it looks like she's doing something naughty!  I don't see that, but somebody should have told her not to look at the camera.The good:  7-9 minute videos that really hammer your mid-section.  If you are in good shape put 2 or 3 together for a nice workout.  She wastes no time which I like.  Hit play and get on your back quick.As you can see from probably 90% of the reviews on here they are probably targeting women for this video.  It was my wife who actually picked this up.  For $12 you can't really go wrong with it.  I initially passed it over when I looked at a few reviews and they were all female.  I thought that maybe men were avoiding it....so I did as well.  Now that I've gone through it a few times (and will continue doing so), I really think that the people who own this are making a big-time marketing mistake by not targeting the male market.  Throw a male model with 6pack abs on this and change the box a bit (this one looks 'girly')...change title to 'Perfect Crunches' or some such thing and they'll hit an entirely new market.

There are 3 beginner segments and 3 advanced segments.  I don't see all that much difference between them.  The woman's voice is a bit annoying (I use this with a group of 18 year old girls, who are very critical and easily annoyed....) but I imagine it is hard to talk while doing sit ups.  My abs are in very good shape and most ab DVDs are disappointing and not challenging enough.  There are a couple segments on here that give a good ab workout.  There could be more for obliques and lower abs, but it's a good starting point and will help to sculpt stronger, firmer abs.",3,basic but pretty good,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,680,"['no-frills', 'DVD', 'as', 'far', 'production', 'very', 'little', 'wasted', 'chatter', 'time', 'are', '3', 'beginner', 'segments', '3', 'advanced', 'segments', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'difference', 'woman', 'voice', 'bit', 'annoying', 'use', 'group', '18', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'critical', 'easily', 'annoyed', 'imagine', 'hard', 'talk', 'doing', 'sit', 'ups', 'abs', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'shape', 'most', 'ab', 'DVDs', 'are', 'disappointing', 'not', 'challenging', 'enough', 'are', 'couple', 'segments', 'here', 'give', 'good', 'ab', 'workout', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'obliques', 'lower', 'abs', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'will', 'help', 'sculpt', 'stronger', 'firmer', 'abs']",Perfect Abs

I really felt the burn on each of the three beginning abs workouts. I was surprised that the ""kickboxing"" routine is done laying on your back though.I certainly still felt the burn, although I'm not sure how a person ""kickboxes"" from the prone position. Nevertheless the workouts are intense and target mostly the upper abs. The lower abs and obliques also get some time but not as much as I would like.I found the lead trainer's voice somewhat irritating, but that is a really small thing, and I'm probably being over critical since the key point is to get a good abs workout, which I have done each time I've gone through one of the various workouts.The six workouts are really only 3 workouts with a beginner and advanced version of each.I am a physically fit 35-year-old soldier, and I found the beginner routines fairly challenging.
