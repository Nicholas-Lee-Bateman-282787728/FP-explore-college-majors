1263429,A2F7CCPK4QL359,B002DH20QU,"Bennet Pomerantz ""Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD""","[22, 23]","If you read previous reviews, they will state missing Music..which is truePrevious reviews state the BB King episode Someone Stole Lucille is missing...Which is trueWhat the other reviewers didnt  mention is the Deals and Wheels episode which was a 21 Jump street cross over is missing from this collection as well the Jump Street second part. You can get this episode and the jump street episode on the21 Jump Street - The Complete Fourth SeasonNow if you are a fan of the acting, other than noting that most  the music is gone, then you will enjoy this collection  for what it is worth. Grieco shines as the off beat Booker. He is no Sam Spade, but it gets the job done. His character holds the show together. He alone is why you want to watch this show.However It was a show the changed styles  from an off beat cop show to a quirky detective show with punkish chic overtones. The show  got weaker by the end of its run. Also Losing Kstie Rich  (after rpisode 14) and putting in Lori Petty was a waste of acting talent and character. It also under used the acting talents of actress Marcia Strassman, who proved she is much more than Mrs Kotter (Welcome Back, Kotter - The Complete First Season) was another nail in this show's coffin.There is no special features or commentary tracks.Just the shows to fill this incomplete collection.I have one thing to say to those studios who make films and those who release DVDs. Wy not spend the money and release the shows as they were. I know music costs. BUT this is why Shout Entertainment canceled the show release of the complete series of Chuck Conner's last series Werewolf. The music rights could not be agreed to and it overlapped important dialog..so you would lose the show if you cut the music--which is slightly the problem with this releaseSo if you liked this one season series, when are they going to release the other Greico one season wonder  series Marker?Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",4,an Incomplete Booker,1254614400,"10 4, 2009",2009,1946,"['read', 'previous', 'reviews', 'will', 'state', 'missing', 'Music..which', 'truePrevious', 'reviews', 'state', 'BB', 'King', 'episode', 'Someone', 'Stole', 'Lucille', 'missing', 'Which', 'other', 'reviewers', 'didnt', 'mention', 'Deals', 'Wheels', 'episode', 'was', '21', 'Jump', 'street', 'cross', 'missing', 'collection', 'as', 'well', 'Jump', 'Street', 'second', 'part', 'can', 'get', 'episode', 'jump', 'street', 'episode', 'the21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'SeasonNow', 'are', 'fan', 'acting', 'other', 'noting', 'most', 'music', 'gone', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'collection', 'what', 'worth', 'Grieco', 'off', 'beat', 'Booker', 'Sam', 'Spade', 'job', 'done', 'character', 'show', 'together', 'alone', 'why', 'want', 'watch', 'show.However', 'was', 'show', 'changed', 'styles', 'off', 'beat', 'cop', 'show', 'quirky', 'detective', 'show', 'punkish', 'chic', 'overtones', 'show', 'got', 'weaker', 'end', 'run', 'Also', 'Losing', 'Kstie', 'Rich', 'rpisode', '14', 'putting', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'was', 'waste', 'acting', 'talent', 'character', 'also', 'used', 'acting', 'talents', 'actress', 'Marcia', 'Strassman', 'who', 'proved', 'much', 'more', 'Mrs', 'Kotter', 'Welcome', 'Back', 'Kotter', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'was', 'nail', 'show', 'coffin.There', 'special', 'features', 'commentary', 'tracks.Just', 'shows', 'fill', 'incomplete', 'collection.I', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'say', 'studios', 'who', 'make', 'films', 'who', 'release', 'DVDs', 'Wy', 'not', 'spend', 'money', 'release', 'shows', 'were', 'know', 'music', 'costs', 'BUT', 'why', 'Shout', 'Entertainment', 'canceled', 'show', 'release', 'complete', 'series', 'Chuck', 'Conner', 'last', 'series', 'Werewolf', 'music', 'rights', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'agreed', 'overlapped', 'important', 'dialog..so', 'would', 'lose', 'show', 'cut', 'music', 'slightly', 'problem', 'releaseSo', 'liked', 'one', 'season', 'series', 'when', 'are', 'going', 'release', 'other', 'Greico', 'one', 'season', 'wonder', 'series', 'Marker', 'Bennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",Booker

Now, of course, Mill Creek is a bare-bones operation, so I wasn't expecting anything other than what I got. And it's nice to see a pristine print (which actually DID surprise me) for the show.
