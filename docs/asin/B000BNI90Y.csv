The television show focuses on the President of the Colonies and the military leaders aboard the Galactica. The show has a gritty, realistic, military feel, but despite this, the show is much more than an action/military show: it expertly blends politics, morality, philososphy, and religion into its many plots and focuses on the many characters as they cope with the travails of humanity facing extinction.Although still fantastic, Season 2.5 was not quite as stellar as the first season or season 2.0.  Although many of the plotlines progressed well, some of the episodes were too predictable, and the writers wrote themselves out of some interesting and tough situations with some radical actions.

945251,A33L7G4E8CID3,B000BNI90Y,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[3, 9]","Is there a such a thing as an overrated science-fiction show or movie? If there is, I haven't heard of it. The really successful sci-fi productions over the years (2001, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Wars--the original three) have generally lived up to the hype, and the obvious suspects (the Men In Black movies, the new Star Wars episodes) were so critically reviled that it's hard to say they're overrated. As you might guess, I'm gearing up to say that Battlestar Galactica is a very underrated series, and that this is inevitable because it is science fiction. However, science fiction is, in a lot of ways, the most inventive genre: with film-noir, or romantic-comedy, etc., there are very definite conventions which one expects to find in a movie of that type. Even with straight drama and comedy, the audience has expectations that it expects will be fulfilled. Science fiction is unique in that people might expect to see ray guns and aliens, but they won't be disappointed if they don't if the story is good, and the genre isn't saddled with the baggage that other genres (like the previously mentioned rom-coms) have to appease. For proof, look at those previously-mentioned productions. What do they all have in common? The answer is: nothing much.Thus, Battlestar Galactica is a show that the middlebrow types might think is goofy or nerdy is, in fact, a gritty, intensely realistic drama that is surprisingly uncompromising in its dark tone while remaining hopeful about humanity. I seem to be in the minority when I say that I thought the show's first season was way too uneven, and the second season (both parts) was a more consistent and addictive experience. The second half of the second season, though, doesn't quite measure up to the first half. We'll get back to that later. One thing that Battlestar always does is that it starts and ends with strongly, and this set is no exception: along with an extended (and better) version of the cliffhanger Pegasus, the demi-season starts with the two-parter ""Resurrection Ship"", which pits Adama (Edward James Olmos) against the ruthless Admiral Cain (Michelle Forbes, in an excellent guest role) and pits both of them, in turn, against a well-protected enemy fleet. The clash of personalities, not the battle, is the focus of these episodes, and as such it is an extremely satisfying piece of television. The season ends strong as well: with episodes like ""The Captain's Hand"", in which Apollo (Jamie Bamber) has to confront an unstable superior officer; ""Downloaded"", where we get an entire show from the point of view of the enemy Cylons; and the 2+ parter ""Lay Down Your Burdens"", which introduces a whole lot of new story elements and lays the way for what will likely be an excellent third season. The finale's audacity alone is refreshing--it's the sort of bold plot deviation that rarely happens in TV anymore.However, the middle is the problem. ""Epiphanies"", which covers the final hours of President Laura Roslin, is not bad if you're willing to get over the somewhat red herring-like plot twist, but seeing VP Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) reaction to a letter to him from Roslin almost singlehandedly rescues the episode. The loser of the set is ""Black Market"", which feels like a warmed-over script from another series (make sure to check out the commentary for this one--Ron Moore's criticism of the episode is fairly accurate). I personally liked ""Scar"" for its unflinching portrayal of the psychic travails of Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff)--it's the most intense episode on the set. ""Sacrifice"" has a similar problem to ""Black Market"", except that it's a hostage situation. It plays out too many of the conventions of that situation, just about all it needs is a pregnant woman giving birth. Even in the weakest episodes of the season, though, there are generally a few redeeming elements--character moments and so forth--that make you keep watching.This being said, I still count seven quite good episodes and three average-to-above average ones. Still a better ratio that most shows, right? It's ultimately excusable, too, because when Battlestar is good, it is just as good as virtually any other show on television, and sometimes better. For people who would lump this show in with Star Trek, it is really an anti-Star Trek--aside from the absence of Trek's overly optimistic philosophy, Battlestar is character-driven rather than plot-driven, with characters that have hidden agendas, traumas and struggles and stories that link directly to the present day and ask some uncomfortable questions about our national policies (like the War on Terror) and our society as well. People who say that it is too grim, though, miss the point. It is an epic of survival and a testament to the unbreakable spirit of humanity. In short, it's a habit worth acquiring.",5,Season 2.5 Reviewed,1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,4854,"['such', 'thing', 'overrated', 'science-fiction', 'show', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'really', 'successful', 'sci-fi', 'productions', 'years', '2001', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Star', 'Wars', 'original', 'three', 'have', 'generally', 'lived', 'up', 'hype', 'obvious', 'suspects', 'Men', 'Black', 'movies', 'new', 'Star', 'Wars', 'episodes', 'were', 'so', 'critically', 'reviled', 'hard', 'say', ""'re"", 'overrated', 'might', 'guess', ""'m"", 'gearing', 'up', 'say', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'very', 'underrated', 'series', 'inevitable', 'science', 'fiction', 'However', 'science', 'fiction', 'lot', 'ways', 'most', 'inventive', 'genre', 'film-noir', 'romantic-comedy', 'etc.', 'are', 'very', 'definite', 'conventions', 'one', 'find', 'movie', 'type', 'Even', 'straight', 'drama', 'comedy', 'audience', 'expectations', 'will', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'Science', 'fiction', 'unique', 'people', 'might', 'expect', 'see', 'ray', 'guns', 'aliens', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'do', ""n't"", 'story', 'good', 'genre', ""n't"", 'saddled', 'baggage', 'other', 'genres', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'rom-coms', 'have', 'appease', 'proof', 'look', 'previously-mentioned', 'productions', 'What', 'do', 'have', 'common', 'answer', 'nothing', 'much.Thus', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'show', 'middlebrow', 'types', 'might', 'think', 'goofy', 'nerdy', 'fact', 'gritty', 'intensely', 'realistic', 'drama', 'surprisingly', 'uncompromising', 'dark', 'tone', 'remaining', 'hopeful', 'humanity', 'seem', 'be', 'minority', 'when', 'say', 'thought', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'uneven', 'second', 'season', 'parts', 'was', 'more', 'consistent', 'addictive', 'experience', 'second', 'half', 'second', 'season', 'though', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'first', 'half', ""'ll"", 'get', 'back', 'later', 'One', 'thing', 'Battlestar', 'always', 'strongly', 'set', 'exception', 'extended', 'better', 'version', 'cliffhanger', 'Pegasus', 'demi-season', 'starts', 'two-parter', 'Resurrection', 'Ship', 'Adama', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'ruthless', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'excellent', 'guest', 'role', 'turn', 'well-protected', 'enemy', 'fleet', 'clash', 'personalities', 'not', 'battle', 'focus', 'episodes', 'such', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'piece', 'television', 'season', 'strong', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'Captain', 'Hand', 'Apollo', 'Jamie', 'Bamber', 'confront', 'unstable', 'superior', 'officer', 'Downloaded', 'where', 'get', 'entire', 'show', 'point', 'view', 'enemy', 'Cylons', '2+', 'parter', 'Lay', 'Down', 'Burdens', 'whole', 'lot', 'new', 'story', 'elements', 'way', 'what', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'excellent', 'third', 'season', 'finale', 'audacity', 'alone', 'refreshing', 'sort', 'bold', 'plot', 'deviation', 'rarely', 'TV', 'anymore.However', 'middle', 'problem', 'Epiphanies', 'final', 'hours', 'President', 'Laura', 'Roslin', 'not', 'bad', ""'re"", 'willing', 'get', 'somewhat', 'red', 'herring-like', 'plot', 'twist', 'seeing', 'VP', 'Gaius', 'Baltar', 'James', 'Callis', 'reaction', 'letter', 'Roslin', 'almost', 'singlehandedly', 'episode', 'loser', 'set', 'Black', 'Market', 'warmed-over', 'script', 'series', 'make', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'commentary', 'one', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'criticism', 'episode', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'personally', 'liked', 'Scar', 'unflinching', 'portrayal', 'psychic', 'travails', 'Kara', 'Starbuck', 'Thrace', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'most', 'intense', 'episode', 'set', 'Sacrifice', 'similar', 'problem', 'Black', 'Market', 'hostage', 'situation', 'out', 'too', 'many', 'conventions', 'situation', 'just', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'giving', 'birth', 'Even', 'weakest', 'episodes', 'season', 'though', 'are', 'generally', 'few', 'redeeming', 'elements', 'character', 'moments', 'so', 'forth', 'make', 'keep', 'watching.This', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'count', 'seven', 'quite', 'good', 'episodes', 'three', 'average-to-above', 'average', 'ones', 'Still', 'better', 'ratio', 'most', 'shows', 'right', 'ultimately', 'excusable', 'too', 'when', 'Battlestar', 'good', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'virtually', 'other', 'show', 'television', 'sometimes', 'better', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'lump', 'show', 'Star', 'Trek', 'really', 'anti-Star', 'Trek', 'aside', 'absence', 'Trek', 'overly', 'optimistic', 'philosophy', 'Battlestar', 'character-driven', 'rather', 'plot-driven', 'characters', 'have', 'hidden', 'agendas', 'traumas', 'struggles', 'stories', 'link', 'directly', 'present', 'day', 'ask', 'uncomfortable', 'questions', 'national', 'policies', 'War', 'Terror', 'society', 'as', 'well', 'People', 'who', 'say', 'too', 'grim', 'though', 'miss', 'point', 'epic', 'survival', 'testament', 'unbreakable', 'spirit', 'humanity', 'short', 'habit', 'worth', 'acquiring']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

The picture quality of the blu-ray is the best way to experience the show. The blacks are deeper, richer, the colors more vibriant, everything is sharper. I watch on a 50"" panasonic plasma G10. The emotion on the actors faces, is more rich, more immediate, more human. On TV and HDTV the image is compressed, on DVD the image is soft. On blu-ray the image is as good as possible. It's not perfect. There's a lot of film grain in some shots. But most of the time the blu-ray advantage is absolutely worth it. It's not AAA, like Sin City or The Dark Knight, but it's a quality HD transfer.THE STORYTELLINGWithout spoilers, here's what I wished I would have known about this series before I started watching it. It has a master story arc, the plan, the heroes journey, etc... But I would guess that only about 25% of the episodes advance the story in a significant way. 75% of the episodes are almost stand-alone character dramas, set inside the world. If you expect every episode to advance the master plot, a lot of the episodes can feel too slow.

Well, the Boomer/Helo/Athena triangle never disappoints. Had it not been for the clever Caprica flashbacks in the finale -- Why didn't they include more of these earlier on? It was a good idea. Too similar to ""Lost"", perhaps? -- the finale wouldn't have been nearly as good. We get to see each of the paths the major characters took to this point. I love a story that comes full circle! I award an extra star for the Caprica flashbacks, as well as the surprise reveal at the very end. I also very much liked Adama's dark turn in ""Sometimes A Great Notion"", as well as the resolution to the Tory storyline. Perhaps it's worth seeing for those alone....Maybe.My reaction to the Fifth Cylon: Really? Was there some sort of groundswell amongst the fans to bring this person back? One I'm not aware of?In the end, it was irrelevant who the Final Five were. And really, who cares? The humanoid Cylons got less and less compelling as they assumed more and more human characteristics. And by the end, there were literally no distinctions left. I have a theory that as soon as the characters in a show start inter-breeding or having long-lost 'family' connections with each other, it's shark time. BSG fell prey to this device, if you think about it. Scenes with the Final Five have a soapy quality to them, which makes these people even less compelling. Ironically, Anders is the most interesting one despite lying on a gurney most the time.The final showdown with all 12 Cylons was pretty odd. What has Cavil been after this entire time? Why is he unable to just replicate the Resurrection machines he's been using all series long? He had plenty of chances. And that's not the only plot hole: There's really only 7 models of Cylon. The other five were erased from the Cylons' memories, and they were never related to them in the first place. So how did Six know there were a total of twelve in the very beginning?Baltar was his usual schizoid self, with a half-baked redemption at the end. I've enjoyed his Christ-like trials in these last episodes, but I can see how it would come off as contrived. Tigh was shackled by his new role and identity; it's hard to believe this is the same Tigh. Tyrol, too, was far too eager to ditch Galactica and the fleet. Kara is discarded away with a weird degree of casualness. And don't get me started on the Virtual Six. Her past actions over the course of the series don't gel with her stated aim.There was no cohesion with past identities of these characters.

This makes it easy to create and complete story arcs seamlessly. With BG, an incredible ground breaking epic with powerful storylines, well developed characters, and a ongoing working of the lore, it seems like they wrote the final episodes on the fly. We were led to believe that all the pieces would eloquently come together to offer a profound, satisfying ending to the mysteries built up during the show. Well, this great show did not do this IMO. For example (caution, spoilers ahead), Starbuck was the harbinger of dome right? We heard this several times over several seasons but this went absolutely nowhere in the end. As a matter of fact, they wrote her off as an angel that did not know she was angel, just born again with no coherent explanation except perhaps the will of God. The intriguing `opera house' buildup (visions) was nothing more than people loosing a little girl from negligence and finding her. The goodbye from Adama to his son was pathetically too short. The complete abandonment of technology with barely a second thought was just absurd. It is one thing to go back to basics but to get rid of everything!!! You would think the groups would set up a way to communicate or meet periodically to learn from each other or help each other --- wasn't the idea to save humanity. If they put the time in to write the script/story such that during moving down to the planet there was a final battle with the centurions which destroys everything, then that would make sense. But No. Instead they just let the Cylon Centurions go! ""They earned it"" You would think that after all that we could expect an ending where they in some way insure the Cylons have no idea where humanity ends up to create a clean ending, and also keep the concept of `all this happened before and can happen again.'. BTW, how about the notions that it was the Centurions who supposedly came up with the idea of a single God. Also, the final five, which I guess where the original five, were nothing more than what they were in the beginning, except that they had a life before and didn't know it.The end of probably the best series in Science Fiction is just an insult to those of us that followed and loved the show.

As such, my review is tempered.  Were I able to rank this offering solely and merely on its content, five stars would not be sufficient.  I strongly believe that this is perhaps one of the finest -- and possibly THE finest -- of all the various shows that have hit the airwaves within the last few years.  Ron Moore's writing is taut and gripping, the acting is first-rate, touches of humor abound, and human relationships take center stage, even amongst those inhuman, despite spectacular eye candy (and candy of both the CGI and slinky kind!).That all having been strongly emphasized first, the mercenary rate at which NBC/Universal Studios has chosen to price its Battlestar Galactica offerings simply cannot be ignored.  Season 1 was only 13 episodes, yet it was priced at $60.  The two individual half-season offerings are only 10 episodes each, yet they're priced at $50.  That works out to $4.61 an episode for season one, $4.99 an episode for seasons ""2.0"" and ""2.5.""  For comparative purposes, a comparable hit, ""Lost"", offered its 24-episode second season for $60, which is half that: $2.50 an episode.This product would easily receive five stars were it only to be priced at a rate designed to be equal to those offered for other television seasons.  As it stands, charging full price for half-content is an act extremely insulting for a show that has received such emphatic and enthusiastic support, and NBC/Universal Studios should behave better; the review is thus downgraded accordingly.  I would, in fact, downgrade it to a single star, except that I cannot bear to go on record as having given this fine series such a low rating.  I would gladly rate this a full five stars were the complete season offered for a $60 list price; as it is, charging a $60 list price for a 13-episode first season, or a combined $100 list price for a 20-episode second season, even one this good, can only be termed massive gluttony and avarice on NBC/Universal's part.",2,A fantastic show -- but you can't look past charging double!,1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,2139,"['When', 'Amazon', 'customer', 'reviews', 'are', 'asking', 'reviews', 'not', 'show', 'alone', 'particular', 'offering', 'show', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'set', 'such', 'review', 'tempered', 'Were', 'able', 'rank', 'offering', 'solely', 'merely', 'content', 'five', 'stars', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'sufficient', 'strongly', 'believe', 'perhaps', 'one', 'finest', 'possibly', 'THE', 'finest', 'various', 'shows', 'have', 'hit', 'airwaves', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'writing', 'taut', 'gripping', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'touches', 'humor', 'abound', 'human', 'relationships', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'even', 'amongst', 'inhuman', 'spectacular', 'eye', 'candy', 'candy', 'CGI', 'slinky', 'kind', 'having', 'been', 'strongly', 'emphasized', 'first', 'mercenary', 'rate', 'NBC/Universal', 'Studios', 'chosen', 'price', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'offerings', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'was', 'priced', '60', 'two', 'individual', 'half-season', 'offerings', 'are', 'only', '10', 'episodes', 'yet', ""'re"", 'priced', '50', 'out', '4.61', 'episode', 'season', 'one', '4.99', 'episode', 'seasons', '2.0', '2.5', 'comparative', 'purposes', 'comparable', 'hit', 'Lost', 'offered', '24-episode', 'second', 'season', '60', '2.50', 'episode.This', 'product', 'would', 'easily', 'receive', 'five', 'stars', 'were', 'only', 'be', 'priced', 'rate', 'designed', 'be', 'equal', 'offered', 'other', 'television', 'seasons', 'charging', 'full', 'price', 'half-content', 'act', 'extremely', 'insulting', 'show', 'received', 'such', 'emphatic', 'enthusiastic', 'support', 'NBC/Universal', 'Studios', 'should', 'behave', 'better', 'review', 'thus', 'downgraded', 'accordingly', 'would', 'fact', 'downgrade', 'single', 'star', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'go', 'record', 'having', 'given', 'fine', 'series', 'low', 'rating', 'would', 'gladly', 'rate', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'were', 'complete', 'season', 'offered', '60', 'list', 'price', 'charging', '60', 'list', 'price', '13-episode', 'first', 'season', 'combined', '100', 'list', 'price', '20-episode', 'second', 'season', 'even', 'one', 'good', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'termed', 'massive', 'gluttony', 'avarice', 'NBC/Universal', 'part']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

I have seen it dubbed ""The Sci-fi series for people who hate sci-fi"" by at least one critic.The show is not affraid to examine many contemporary issues in the guise of fiction, and it shies away from easy answers. Although there are villians and antagonists throughout, one of the most endearing features of the show is the way these roles can change and shift over time. There are certainly times when the viewer is not sure who is right and who they want to win.

Like many television shows, this series has begun to suffer from narrative ""selective amnesia"" that allowed the creators to remember what is convenient and dismiss whated they want to ignore -- even if the ignored plot points were crucial to earlier episodes. While this works in many shows, watching these tactics employed in a ""naturalist"" television program - even one that is science-fiction by nature - feels at best cheap and at worst downright unfaithful to its audience.Additionally, grand episode and season long arcs are resolved unsatisfactorily, seemingly at whim, and characters go through massive transformations that are retconned away within the space of one, maybe two, episodes. And while this was once a show where getting shot by a bullet really hurt -- note that the LEAD of the show was in a coma in Season 2.0 for what felt like forever -- in the back half of the season Lee Adama was shot, wounded badly, and healed again in TWO STRAIGHT episodes. Oy! Naturalism, this ain't.

Last year, the 12 Colonies of Kobol were nearly blown away by the cylons, machines that resemble humans, nearly ran out of water and fuel, and had the two leaders somehow incapacitated.  Commander William ""Husker"" Adama (Edward James Olmos) was shot by Junior Lt. Sharon ""Boomer"" Valerii (Grace Park), who turned out to be a cylon, while President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) was put in Galactica's brig for convincing Lt. Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) to defy Commander Adama.  Starbuck is now on Caprica, stranded with Lt. Karl ""Helo"" Agathon (Tahmoh Penikett) after another copy of the Boomer cylon stole the ship that Starbuck used to get to the planet.  Captain Lee ""Apollo"" Adama (Jamie Bamber), the commander's son, is also under arrest for attempting to stage a mutiny with the president and pointed a gun at the head of the Executive Officer of Galactica, Col. Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan).  Finally, Vice President Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis), Chief Gallen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas), Lt. ""Crashdown"" (Sam Witwer), and Specialist Cally (Nicki Clyne) are stranded on Kobol and are surrounded by cylon centurions.  As I said, things start out bad, and they only get worse.With the older Adama unconscious, Tigh is put in charge, and it is clear that he is no leader.  He has an alcohol problem, an ambitious wife (Kate Vernon), and a surly attitude towards most people.  Furthermore, his relationship with Apollo, who is the head pilot on Galactica, is obviously very strained now that Apollo put his gun to Tigh's head.  In the first two episodes, Galactica gets seperated from the rest of the fleet, leaving the civilians defenseless, and a cylon raiding party boards the ship and attempts to take out the ship from within.On Caprica, Starbuck and Helo try to find a way off the planet, only to run into a human resistance group that has been operating out of an old hospital.  But they aren't the only ones that Starbuck finds; a frightening plot is uncovered by her when she encounters a group of cylons.  Meanwhile, the people on Kobol are forced to fend for themselves while Galactica is busy trying to find the fleet and deal with Boomer.  Number Six (Tricia Helfer) begins to get a firmer grip over Baltar's mind, and gets him to do more and more questionable deeds.And that's all in the first few episodes.  Unlike most shows, the problems presented at the end of Season 1 aren't solved in the first episode.  Many of them are so deep that it requires multiple episodes to resolve certain characters' predicaments.  I'm going to give a small spoiler by saying that eventually, everyone makes it back to Galactica, meaning that Helo is back on the ship for the first time since the Miniseries pilot.  Of course, this creates only more trouble due to the bizarre love triangle that exists between Tyrol, Boomer, and Helo.  Each man loved her, and in S1, they each got to know a different copy of the same model.  Now, they both have a love/hate relationship with the copy remaining on Galactica.  Further troubles come about through the paranoid actions of crew members (my favorite involving Specialist Cally), the introduction of 2 new human-form cylon models (bringing the total to 6, leaving 6 left to be uncovered), and the reappearance of political ""activist"" Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch, of the original Battlestar Galactica).These 10 episodes further prove that a science fiction show can not only be good, but be amazing.  It is a shame that this show is overlooked by many people as just a ""sci-fi"" show, but it is so much more.  Most critics as well as the relatively large number of fans (for a show on a cable genre network, it sure does get good ratings) recognize that this is a compelling drama that just happens to take place in outer space.  It deals with weighty subjects such as genocide, human flaws, paranoia, and religion.This season retooled the opening theme a little bit.  The music is now the chant used in Season 1 in the UK (instead of the march used last year in the US), and while most of the clips are still from the miniseries, there are a few from the previous year.  For a while, the second part of the credits, which showed scenes from the episode set to a drum beat, was removed, only to be replaced halfway into the run (fortunately).  The most interesting addition is a textual representation of how many people are still alive.  Each week in the credits, there is a sentence which lists the exact number of survivors, and it changes every week, depending on how many people died (or appeared) the week before.It's hard to say which season is better (so far; this is only half of S2, which I'll get to soon).  The 13 episodes of S1 were all great.  In the first half of S2, there are no ""bad"" episodes per se, but there are some episodes that don't seem up to the usual quality that we expect from Battlestar Galactica (such as ""Valley of Darkness"").  However, the best episodes of the season (so far) have been absolutely amazing.  ""Scattered"", ""Home, Parts 1 and 2"", and ""Pegasus"", which in my opinion is the best episode of the series so far, are sheer brilliance.As for the whole ""Season 2.0"" thing, I am very upset about this.  All the respect that I had for Universal for releasing the Miniseries with the S1 set evaporated when I learned that they were pulling this stunt.  Due to the schedule of the Sci-Fi channel, they are releasing the first half of S2 before Christmas, and then when the season ends in March, they'll release the second half, thus forcing us to spend more money on these two sets than we would have to if it were one set.  I really hope that they eventually release ""The Complete Second Season"", and I will hold off buying this until I get a definitive answer.  If there isn't going to be a Complete S2 set, I will buy both sets (I will be a little ticked off, but I love BSG too much), but if they release a Complete S2 set, I would reccomend buying that one.This is one of the best show's on TV right now.  If you are a sci-fi fan, this is a must-see show.  If you aren't a sci-fi fan, you should still consider checking this out.  Even though it's in space and has killer robots, it is more human than most other drama shows on TV today.

Some people will look at this and find all kinds of different meaning and like i said above some people will have found it fulfilling and think that all was answered for them while most people will not.But looking at this from a perspective of looking at the story for what is worth, season 4.5 is full of cops out and a lame ending that has left a many with a sour taste in their mouth and wondering why they had even watched the series to begin with.The series was lost when religious storyline undertones emerged and it carried on until the very end blurring the fact that this was a series against men and machine to begin with. The men vs machine was the basis of the show and in the end it did not even matter.Too many plot holes were not resolved even though promised by the authors. In the very last episode we were left with many more questions as to why said set of events had happened during the show. We were just left to our own devises, trying to figure out what the heck was going on...Imagine for one moment trying to watch an episode of House M.D wherein everything is resolved but the show cuts off and you never learn the fate of the patient at all. Would you really consider this episode good?I for one was terribly disappointed that the authors decided to take this approach to resolve the end of this story. Most people agree that we are simply left with an unfinished piece of fiction. And this is the infuriating part because it was so good until the last few episodes.I do not know if people will agree with me but this is how i view this.Big waste of my time to be frank...",1,Great series destroyed by cop out ending,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,1869,"['am', 'one', 'many', 'who', 'followed', 'series', 'start', 'finish', 'highs', 'lows', 'series.Depending', 'outlook', 'things', 'might', 'say', 'ending', 'series', 'was', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'invention', 'ham', 'cheese', 'sandwich', 'people', 'will', 'look', 'find', 'kinds', 'different', 'meaning', 'i', 'said', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'found', 'fulfilling', 'think', 'was', 'answered', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'not.But', 'looking', 'perspective', 'looking', 'story', 'what', 'worth', 'season', '4.5', 'full', 'cops', 'lame', 'ending', 'left', 'many', 'sour', 'taste', 'mouth', 'wondering', 'why', 'had', 'even', 'watched', 'series', 'begin', 'with.The', 'series', 'was', 'lost', 'when', 'religious', 'storyline', 'undertones', 'emerged', 'carried', 'very', 'end', 'blurring', 'fact', 'was', 'series', 'men', 'machine', 'begin', 'men', 'vs', 'machine', 'was', 'basis', 'show', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'matter.Too', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'were', 'not', 'resolved', 'even', 'promised', 'authors', 'very', 'last', 'episode', 'were', 'left', 'many', 'more', 'questions', 'why', 'said', 'set', 'events', 'had', 'happened', 'show', 'were', 'just', 'left', 'own', 'devises', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'going', 'Imagine', 'one', 'moment', 'trying', 'watch', 'episode', 'House', 'M.D', 'everything', 'resolved', 'show', 'off', 'never', 'learn', 'fate', 'patient', 'Would', 'really', 'consider', 'episode', 'good', 'one', 'was', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'authors', 'decided', 'take', 'approach', 'resolve', 'end', 'story', 'Most', 'people', 'agree', 'are', 'simply', 'left', 'unfinished', 'piece', 'fiction', 'infuriating', 'part', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'last', 'few', 'episodes.I', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'people', 'will', 'agree', 'how', 'i', 'view', 'this.Big', 'waste', 'time', 'be', 'frank']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

945271,A3BG5AR5KE6QYG,B000BNI90Y,Bill W,"[2, 9]","Having watched season 2.5 DVD(also Mini, 1 and 2)as well as listened to the commentary tracks by any measure this is one hell of series and one hell of  ensemble cast, one hell of a writing staff.Keep in mind compared to earlier 70's Galactica this show aims at an adult mixed audience rather than 12 year old boys. That alone accounts for many of the differences between the two shows.This is what TV should be. This is why one ""could"" be justified to pay for cable.Never the less Battlestar Galactica isn't perfect!It's characters and crews are equally flawed.Battlestar Galactica in concept is based on an Aircraft Carrier and as such has problems in the Space environment.1. Ocean warfare for Surface Combatants is essentially 2D tactics. Even Submarines and aircraft are tied to the surface plane. In space no such  reference exists so all Combatants must use 3D tactics essentially all movement/attack directions are possible. ""Galactica uses 2D tactics don't wonder they lost the war""!2. To follow the Aircraft Carrier analogy. A carrier requires ""mission specific escorts"". Galactica on the other hand, other than her own ""Vipers""  has ""no"" screening protection. In short because of the value of the target the  civilian vessels are escorting the(high Value)Battlestars and the ""Presidential One"" not the other way around. In turn the Battlestars Vipers provide protective cover(CAP)for the entire fleet.3. Weapon systems: For some reason ""Vipers"" use cannons not missiles or  laser type weapons. While this was great in WW2, high speed aircraft and spacecraft tend to be shot down by overtaking thier own projectiles. And then there is the uses of ""small arms"" in pressurized spacecraft. Not a good idea. And whats the need for the marines in full ""battle gear"" (flack jackets, etc)while on guard duty on board ship.4. Nuclear Weapons tend to cause problems with electronics. EMP would likly ""disable"" all but the most ""hardened"" warship systems. This is to say nothing about radiation effects.5.  What is the problem with ""Networked Computers"" again? A closed system such as a ship's network needs an input device ""COM LINK"" (i.e.IO port or modem). The ships computers can withstand nuclear attack ""EMP"" but can be knocked out by a WiFi hotspot! ""Come on""!6.  Miracle Cures and Trek Science lessons. Over the 2 seasons I have noted the producers both disdain Star Trek yet in 2.5 recently they have used ""fussy science"" to write their way out plot dead ends.7. Tease Factor, while to be expected on network TV, Battlestar Galactica is a cable show, enough with the Backlighting and Cropping.8. After three years I would like to see a little more Character and plot development outside the the ""Battlestars"" and ""Presidential One"". To date only the the ""excellent"" Richard Hatch has given the viewers a alternative viewpoints to the Military and Political intrigues. Yes I did see the Brothels in the ""Black Market"".9. I am some what concerned about the almost callus disregard many of the Military Characters have for ""CIVILIAN"" Authority. While this has improved in BSG 2.5. in the case of Adama. Both senior officers Adama and Cain are poor leadership examples in this area. In both cases ""Junior officers"" moved to protect the ""CIVILIAN"" Authority. On the other handMary McDonnell as President Laura Roslin and James Callis as Dr. Gaius Baltar haven't been ideal democratic leaders either.10. I guess the ""biggest"" area that Galactica needs to work on is the total lack of a ""fraternization policy"" at first it could be forgiven considering the ""dire state"" of affairs but as the series goes forward this should be a serious concern for now Admiral Adama. I contend this was a serious flaw in Admiral Helena Cain command. Evidenced by her rather sadistic abuse of ""Six"". A more over a detailed investigation could provide evidence and cause.All in all the show is perhaps the best SciFi/Drama on the air/cable today. Generally the acting is ""extremely good"".  Edward James Olmos has nailed his role as ""Commander/Admiral William Adama"".  Michael Hogan as ""Colonel Saul Tigh"" is playing a difficult role of the ""flawed Officer"". Borders on Bogarts ""Queeg"" in ""The Caine Mutiny"". Speaking of ""flawed Officers"" Michelle Forbes provides an equally knife edge performance as the strong willed(Kurtz like)Admiral Helena Cain.Directing is very good. Althrough the camera work takes a bit of getting use too.  The show could use a ""senior"" military adviser to provide some balance to to an otherwise excellent production.I Recommend the series whole heartedly!",4,LOGIC BOMB,1160265600,"10 8,

945272,AM9MWTO42TH2N,B000BNI90Y,Bob Emmerich,"[9, 10]","This is a great show but this review is about this lame rushed out the door boxset. In case you have read info on this disc set elsewhere saying otherwise: there is NO longer version of the final episode ""Pegasus"", there are NO Podcasts for the final 2 episodes and one other (so 7 podcasts for 10 episodes). Not much in the way of extras either as per Season 1 though over an hour of deleted scenes, though again NONE from the final episode. Sooo, yes this was very much rushed out of the door in time for the holidays in what one might consider an incomplete form. The big question now is: will we be forced to repurchase all of these episodes to get the remainder of the season or will we be able to just buy the second half?

Smith,"[80, 88]","While I would give the series as a whole (and each individual season preceding this) 5 stars, I feel compelled to drop this final chapter to 4 stars. Battlestar Galactica is a brilliant, gutsy show, and the risks it took are part of the reason we fans got so intense about it over the years. It was called the most subversive show in television history by Rolling Stone magazine, and, given the plot-lines about terrorism and insurgency at the height of the Iraq War, I think that's a fair assessment. The final season (4.0 and 4.5) become more about the internal mythology of the show, and this is where a few problems sneak in. As shows like Lost demonstrate, it's easier to set up mysteries than to resolve them. Battlestar resolves many of the plot-lines brilliantly (I love the choice of the final cylon in particular; and one character's suicide is truly haunting), but others leave me wanting. Starbuck, one of the best characters in this all-around extraordinary cast, gets muddled. I'm trying to avoid spoilers, so I'll just say that the resolution of the mystery surrounding her character is not satisfactorily handled. Ron Moore's decision to leave her conclusion ambiguous is, in my opinion, a glaring error.The series finale is naturally the focus of this set, and I must say I've had mixed feelings about it since it aired. On the one hand, it was an intense, emotional experience, never boring for a moment, and brought nearly every character and plotline to a conclusion. However, I think it may have over-reached, beating us over the head with its ""message."" Battlestar Galactica was often a reflection of ourselves and our world, but never before had it been didactic, as it is in its final scene.With another movie on its way and a prequel series for next year, Battlestar Galactica isn't over yet, but this is the end of the story as begun in the 2003 miniseries.

I had a hard time accepting most of the contrived underlying premises that one had to assume in order to, ""go with it.""  The real world is more my cup of tea.  Plausibility is almost an absolute necessity for my enjoyment of anything that follows.  If not for this series and my reading of the various reviews, the tone of which led me to try one more presumably thin premise, I would not have known what I was missing.This series, ""Battlestar Galactica,"" is so different for me, and maybe for you, too.  First of all, the storyline could be told in any setting from the old west to modern war stories.  That resonant theme is the crux of the availability for me to enjoy all of it.  Now, even the unusual setting has become so curiously unique to my taste buds I actually really like it.  I got Firefly, the series and Serenity.  The same superior enjoyment erupted.  I am a very satisfied convert to the genre so much so that it is to the point that I now need no plausible underlying set of necessarily logical premises anymore.  What a change, and this series did it.  The 4400?  A bit too unsolvable still for my taste.  The Dead Zone?  I can now accept the unrealistic premise, because of Battlestar.I have never been one that could watch things more than once, even stuff I liked.  But I can put BG in the DVD player anytime, anywhere and at any point of time in the series story.  The series is a very pleasant surprise.  Isn't that Starbuck the baddest b**** in space?!

Why does Adama not return to live with his people? Why does Kara Thrace simply vanish?Presumably, it's because the show's creators insist on keeping a bleak tone to the very end, which means Starbuck and Lee Adama can't live happily ever after.But again, the worst thing about Lee and Starbuck not getting together in the end is not that it's unhappy. No, the problem is that it's predictable.The truth is, this entire season just feels tacked on, created simply because season 4.0 left loose ends that had to be cleared up. In truth, the series had the chance to end  on a much better note in season 4.0.Was it really necessary to turn Earth into a bleak, nuclear wasteland thereby necessitating another junket into outer space?",2,SPOILER ALERT!

945288,A1GW7V6S6XSXX3,B000BNI90Y,Christopher Mayo,"[2, 2]","I bought all of the seasons separately as they first came out, and I highly recommend watching the entire television series through to the end. This was a fabulous season.While looking for the last piece of the series (see the end of the review), I came across some great deals (in terms of price), but was dismayed to see just how confusing things have become on Amazon. This review below is meant to help you wade through the mess in the marketplace, purchase the series, and enjoy it. I originally posted it for the combined Seasons 4.0 and 4.5 set, but someone kindly suggested I post it elsewhere as well. I hope you find it helpful.DVD CONFUSION-------------------------------------------------------The show is incredible. However, the whole DVD thing has been a disaster. They released it in the worst way possible (see below), Amazon compounded the problem by lumping together reviews for DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, and the DVD manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some products. I cannot imagine how someone who is not deeply familiar with it is supposed to purchase this wonderful show. Certainly, they would hesitate to give it as a gift! Let's hope this solves your problem.In one sentence, I can say that here is what you want to get: Seasons 1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5, and The Plan. I have links to them below. If you get these, then you will be sure to have it all.========================================-Season One was released as (Battlestar Galactica  - Season One) altogether with the pilot in one box.-Season Two was released asBattlestar Galactica - Season 2.0 (Episodes 1-10)andBattlestar Galactica: Season 2.5 (Episodes 11-20)in two boxes. You can now purchase them together asBattlestar Galactica (2004): Seasons 2.0 & 2.5-Season Three was released together in one box asBattlestar Galactica - Season Three.-Season Four was released asBattlestar Galactica - Season 4.0andBattlestar Galactica: Season 4.5with the Razor episode. Those are now available together asBattlestar Galactica (2004): Season 4.0 & 4.5. Occasionally I come across things like ""Battlestar Galactica: Season 4.5 - Limited Edition Gift Set (2009)."" It seems like a lot of money for one part of the full season, but you get some dog tags with it, so if you are into collecting memorabilia, you might want to consider it.-The Plan was released on its own asBattlestar Galactica: The Plan========================================OPTIONS FOR PURCHASING THEM ALL TOGETHER: BAD TO GOOD--------------------------------------------------------Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON). Not recommended. I do not own this, but according to the reviews, it is packaged poorly WITHOUT AN EPISODE LIST. That seems like a horrible idea for four seasons of a tv show. Apparently, it contains the same DVDs as the ones sold separately (explained above).-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (the one in the GRAY BOX). *Recommended*. I do not own this. Good reviews of it so far. Packaging problems were fixed. According to a comment from Leif Sheppard, it does include The Plan.-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON) [BLU-RAY] or the gray box [BLU-RAY] set. *Recommended*. I do not own this. Seems to include some extras, but not significant. It also has an episode list, according to the reviews. It might be worth buying if you wanted to get everything together.BOTTOM LINE:-------------------------------------------------------As far as I can tell from the reviews, ONLY the Blu-Ray version contains everything you need. So, I think there are two choices:(1) Buy the Blu-Ray set or the Gray DVD set.(2) Purchase everything separately (make sure to get all of the stuff mentioned above).NOTE:--------------------------------------------------------The ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes (episodes shown only online) have not been made available for purchase in any of the sets as far as I can tell. What a shame!-Also, if anyone sees any mistakes in this review, please tell me and I will edit it.

The characters, all in all, are rather stock and predictable.  Ditto the stories and writing, which we've repeatedly predicted as the episodes unfold.  This isn't said to pat ourselves on the back, a ""Woo-hoo, look how clever we are.""  No no.  It frustrates us, actually.  We'd much rather not be able to peg the series as easily as we do, but when the writers consistently take the road most traveled by, stringing cliched character conflicts and dialogue together to such an excessive degree, it's hard not to be exasperated by it.  For all its admittedly excellent production design and decent to good acting, the new incarnation of Battlestar Galactica lacks the originality of the average charm bracelet.  It seems the creators expended their creativity on the ""reimagining"" itself.  I'm sure legions of fans are spit-taking their coffee right now, so I'll use the episode we watched tonight, ""Flight of the Phoenix,"" as an example.**SPOILER ALERT****Stop reading if you don't want to get hit by all the clich&eacute;s flying about!  Skip down to the ""end spoiler"" alert.**Okay--we knew that ""Sharon"" the Cylon was going to save the day.  We knew that Adama would be stern and threaten her and still not trust her in the end.  We knew that Tigh (Tighe?) would be  blustery and ineffective until suddenly becoming sober and professional after his weekly admonishment from Adama.  (Which happens only slightly more frequently than his being manipulated by his irritatingly transparent wife.)  We knew that Helo would do something to make the card players who gave him short shrift during the poker game respect him by the end of the episode--and that every card player *would be shown* at the end shaking his hand for it.  Everything must be spelled out and tied up neatly for us simple viewers.  And this is our point: That almost without fail, the writers write to the stereotypes.  Yes, Starbuck as created goes against type, but she's a clich&eacute; of her own rebellious type.  Of course she was going to offer to fly the new fighter that the chief was building, because she's the ""hot dog"" pilot who's not afraid of anything.  But boy, we were sure kept in suspense when Apollo couldn't make radio contact with her.** END SPOILER ALERT **It's this clich&eacute;-addled story construction and writing that makes it hard to enjoy the show, because the actors have to react in a realistic way to unrealistically contrived situations.  Which explains why the only time in the twenty-three episodes I've watched that I've felt the slightest lump in my throat was in the twenty-second episode when the original theme song began playing.And yet we are hooked, and we do know why: We want to know what happens. The basic premise of the show, as it was with the original series, is interesting enough that it keeps us turning the pages, as it were.  The overall quality of the show, particularly this second season, is good enough that we can return to whet our appetite about where the show is going.  But, as with George Lucas' latest Star Wars trilogy, we can't escape the feeling of ""Oh, the opportunity lost.""  The actors on Galactica are better than their material.  We think; perhaps they're not and we're glad they have what they do, but at this rate we'll never know.  This is badly formulaic television at its best.

945291,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000BNI90Y,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 6]","Battlestar Galactica had a full count of episodes in season 2 but decided to give fans and themselves a break halfway for a couple months. Inexplicably, the season is not in one big set but rather split in half at full price. It's one of those kind of unforgivable things that doesn't derail the season simply because the episodes are so great. While things in the middle section somewhat sag, they're bookended but awesome episodes that should appeal not only to sci-fi fans but drama fans in general.The previous set ended with Pegasus, where the ship encounters another Battlestar, named the Pegasus. Initially relieved and excited about a 2nd ship, things turn worse thanks to the ship's Commander who is quite strict and deadset in her beliefs, even if it means going against fair judgment. This leads into the 2 parter Resurrection Ship where one of the Cylon ships holds an important secret that can help out the humans considerably if destroyed. At the end of the season we have Downloaded where we follow Galactica's Boomer and Six(the real one who's in love with Gaius)'s rebirth on Caprica and their feelings for their respective men. This follows into the 2 part season finale Lay Down Your Burdens. Starbuck decides to finally rescue her men and his friends from Caprica while the Presidential race heats up and takes a sudden turn when a habitable planet is located by accident. This eventually leads to a shocking finale that ends up changing everything.A lot of shows when it comes down to season finales don't tend to change anything. They're just really big episodes that gets resolved in the premiere of next season and everything's back to normal. The finale here though ultimately does a heavy number on the crew and fleet.

Alas, we didn't get either of those, and I would wait no longer.This first half of the season is certainly a strong one, perhaps even the best bunch of Battlestar Galactica episodes you could buy on DVD as of now. However, you'll definitely not share that same sentiment if you aren't already familiar with Season 1 and the story so far, and you'll most likely be interested in the second half of Season 2 as well. Thus I'd not recommend buying Season 2.0 unless you already have bought, or are willing to buy the Season 1 and Season 2.5 sets as well, or if you can watch those via other means. There is no great need to go into details about the show's story-line then -- if you liked the first season, you are going to enjoy this one much the same.Beyond this, there's not much to say about this set. It's got what's expected: OK video and sound quality, English and Spanish subtitles, Ron Moore's podcast commentaries which were already published previously on the web when the episodes aired on TV, plus some deleted scenes. Those deleted scenes are also freely available on SciFi's website, and are quite uninteresting, not a loss that they were cut. In the end I feel a bit shortchanged by the amount of bonus features. A featurette or two would have been welcome, particularly as there's plenty of space to spare on the last, third disc. Interviews, bloopers, behind the scenes, something. This is reason two why I'm only giving this set 4 stars, reason one being the cutting of the season into two separate releases.As a footnote, there apparently are complete Season 2 sets available in other markets, such as the Region 2 PAL release you could order from Amazon's UK subsidiary. After accounting for the currency exchange, shipping costs, discounts etc. however, I realized it would not be any cheaper than buying both half-seasons here.",4,Great entertainment for fans of the show,1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,2083,"['have', 'waited', 'patiently', 'release', 'second', 'half', 'Season', '2', 'buy', '2.0', 'set', 'comprising', 'first', '10', 'episodes', 'show', 'second', 'season', 'hoping', 'vain', 'better', 'whole', 'season', 'package', 'cheaper', 'bundle', 'deal', 'Alas', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'would', 'wait', 'longer.This', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'certainly', 'strong', 'one', 'perhaps', 'even', 'best', 'bunch', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'could', 'buy', 'DVD', 'now', 'However', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'not', 'share', 'same', 'sentiment', 'are', ""n't"", 'already', 'familiar', 'Season', '1', 'story', 'so', 'far', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'interested', 'second', 'half', 'Season', '2', 'as', 'well', 'Thus', ""'d"", 'not', 'recommend', 'buying', 'Season', '2.0', 'already', 'have', 'bought', 'are', 'willing', 'buy', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '2.5', 'sets', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'watch', 'other', 'means', 'great', 'need', 'go', 'details', 'show', 'story-line', 'then', 'liked', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'going', 'enjoy', 'one', 'much', 'same.Beyond', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'set', 'got', 'what', 'expected', 'OK', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'podcast', 'commentaries', 'were', 'already', 'published', 'previously', 'web', 'when', 'episodes', 'aired', 'TV', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'freely', 'available', 'SciFi', 'website', 'are', 'quite', 'uninteresting', 'not', 'loss', 'were', 'cut', 'end', 'feel', 'bit', 'shortchanged', 'amount', 'bonus', 'features', 'featurette', 'two', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'particularly', 'plenty', 'space', 'spare', 'last', 'third', 'disc', 'Interviews', 'bloopers', 'scenes', 'something', 'reason', 'two', 'why', ""'m"", 'only', 'giving', 'set', '4', 'stars', 'reason', 'one', 'being', 'cutting', 'season', 'two', 'separate', 'releases.As', 'footnote', 'apparently', 'are', 'complete', 'Season', '2', 'sets', 'available', 'other', 'markets', 'such', 'Region', '2', 'PAL', 'release', 'could', 'order', 'Amazon', 'UK', 'subsidiary', 'accounting', 'currency', 'exchange', 'shipping', 'costs', 'discounts', 'etc', 'however', 'realized', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'cheaper', 'buying', 'half-seasons', 'here']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

I have never been more happy and heart-broken @ the same time.. @ least not with a tv show.. It broke so many boundaries.. and genres.. The story was enthralling.. dramatic, epic, nerve-wrecking & melancholic.. It encompasses past, present & future.. It's a post-apocalyptic militaristic cyberpunk space-opera testing the morality and logic of an age of fear.. and whether the human race deserves to survive.. I have never cared for characters in a story as much as I care for the characters of BSG.. Each character evolves and grows so much from beginning to end... Some of them discover who they really are.. Others can never go back to who they were.. The story ends so epically tragic, yet with a complete sense of closure.. and peace..I feel like one of the only fans who really appreciated the way the differences between human and cylon were slowly peeled away in the ""soap opera' episodes that make up most of season 4.5.. The show has always been about the characters.. The cg'd space battles have always been top notch but that's not why you're watching.. The show has never been a flashy or glamorous everyday space-chase saga.. with sexy aliens and tazer gunz.. It's not star trek/wars.. It set out from the start.. dirty, raw and spartan.. but above all.. melodramatic.. Had the last season been all battle scenes and explosions.. I dont think BSG would have the same emotional resonance that it has.. The characters have always done more soul searching then space traveling.. It's always been an adventure of exhaustion.. not exhilaration.. Their journey into the universe ends within themselves.. and that's how it needed to end..The negative reviews just irk me really.. I think, for those disappointed in the spiritual aspects of the shows finale.. It's important to remember this show has often been centered around faith.. They spent almost the entire series, putting all their hopes and dreams into the prophesies of a 2000 yr old religion(imagine that).  All the negative reviews spend a lot of time on the 'god' aspect.. but the show was never been subtle about religion.. NEVER.. So what were people expecting??.. Had they given us some finite explanation for everything.. it would have taken away from one of the major focal points of BSG.. faith.Some think that the 'god aspect' was a cheap way to finish the story.

945311,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,B000BNI90Y,Edmonson,"[0, 0]","Battlestar Galactica's season 4.5 is the final season for the series, and we get it here in widescreen with Blu-ray's 1080p high definition and 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio. It's truly a treat to finally see this series as it was originally filmed.The images sparkle and the richness of the contrast between light and dark really adds an extra punch to the scenes. Also added are extended episodes of three episodes, along with the originally aired episodes, including the three part finale shown without interruption.It becomes more obvious how the various scenes were shot by comparing the softer interior shots of the Cylon base ship to the harsher, clearer scenes on the Battlestar Galactica. This adds an otherworldly quality to the scenes shot inside the Cylon ship which are contrasted with the sharp details of close-ups of Adama and others on the Battlestar Galactica that emphasizes a psychological immediacy. Perhaps this contrast in clarity can be said to accentuate the fact that the Cylon's world isn't the blood and guts world of the humans, and that the Cylons live in a sort of utopia. The human's world is fraught with the harsh reality of life and death struggles whereas the interiors of the Cylon ship are represented by the pristine, orderly world of soft, tranquil blinking patterns of lights, and water like streams of beaded light dripping down strands of veils. The Cylon's world represents a kind of idealized world whereas the human world is often portrayed  as disorderly, archaic, and dilapidated. This representation of the human world as a messy and complicated place is reflected in their various ideologies as well as in their pantheon of gods. Other techniques, from the steadier shots inside the Cylon ship, compared to the jumpy camera movements through the Battlestar Galactica's labyrinth of hallways, emphasizes these two different worlds.In the final episode these two worlds are replaced with a natural, restful world where everything is seemingly in harmony. The humans vanquish themselves of their technology and attempt a new beginning in harmony with nature, though of course after a few days, or even a few nights of sleeping without the comforts of life, and being bitten by mosquitoes, the euphoria of being temporarily cleansed of civilization will begin to wear off, and the hard work will begin. People will try to make their lives more comfortable, and attempt to gain some control over their world. People will again invent tools and begin to make things. And so the cycle will repeat, or will it? Will there be a new permutation? What makes it so interesting to see this series on Blu-ray is to see how the cinematography accentuates these various aspects and points of view.The very last scenes take us to our contemporary world. It seems the writers have again taken some liberties and have left us with some more perplexing questions as the final season has numerous leaps of logic and flights of fantasy not seen in the earlier seasons. At the very end, in our time, 150,000 years later, we see Number 6 and Baltar. Was Gaius Baltar a Cylon after all? How else could he be alive 150,000 years after the survivors of Battlestar Galactica landed on Earth, remembering everthing that has come before? If Cylons didn't die out wouldn't they have directed civilization differently? Apparently some things have changed since the last cycle given that Cylons already exist before humans have developed Cylons. But why then does everything look the same as our time right down to the buildings?At the end is Kara Thrace shown to be an angel after all since she disappears into thin air? Or is Lee dreaming? If this was a ghost story then I would have suspended my disbelief, but this isn't the world that we were presented with in earlier seasons. Everything seemed to adhere to the natural world that we know. But in the final season there seems to be many amazing things that transpire. It is never explained how Number 6 and Baltar at one point can see the other's subconsious self, or why they even had these subconscious alter egos and no one else did, or how Number 6, Roslin, or Sharon, shared the same vision of the opera house and no one else does.  Kara is perhaps a ghost who also sees other ghosts, like the man (her father?) playing the piano who disappears when Kara is suddenly surrounded by members of the final five. Interestingly, there is a clip that shows a poster that advertises Kara's father performing at an opera house.The last season lacks some of the clarity of earlier seasons, but through the overall strength of the characters, the high quality production, the immense creativity, and searing drama, these lapses don't sink the ship.Perhaps one disappointing omission from this set is that there are no ""The Face of the Enemy"" webisodes included. In these webisodes Gaeta's past relationship to the Cylon model ""Sharon"" helps explain his distrust of Cylons. This leads eventually to Gaeta's treasonous ways as he teams up with Zarek against Adama.",5,The Mystery of the Opera House and the Death Rattles of the Battlestar,1248998400,"07 31,

945316,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B000BNI90Y,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","Ron Moore, one of the brains behind Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, took his darker view of sci-fi to the new Battlestar Galactica series with generally positive results. This isn't Star Trek by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it's tough to compare BSG to any other sci-fi show. It combines an in-depth story arc, top-notch acting, realistic special effects, and a pseudo-documentary cinematic style to create a unique experience.Unlike Star Trek, BSG tries to depict a gritty, realistic vision of humanity's future. In the first few episodes, a race of evil robots called the Cylons attack 12 human colonies, leaving only a few tens of thousands of humans left in the galaxy. The humans band together in a convey of ships to search for Earth.Amongst the main characters, the acting ranges from good to excellent. In particular, Edward James Olmos as Admiral Adama is absolutely amazing at conveying the burdens of command. I first saw Olmos as Detective Gaff in Blade Runner and never could have imagined him as the star of a TV series, but he really shines. Mary McDonnell as Laura Roslin also wins plaudits as perhaps the most convincing female president ever portrayed on TV.As much as I like individual episodes in Season 2, the meta-plot as a whole is somewhat ridiculous. Season 2 ventured heavily into pseudo-religious nonsense. I have nothing against religion, but the use of religious metaphors in BSG was always a bit too on the nose. Oddly, the show doesn't use religion to talk about morality, in the way that Star Trek was often a series of morality plays, but rather as plot devices. By Season 2, the president is running around looking for Earth based on religious prophecies. Meanwhile, everybody proclaims that the baby of a human and Cylon is the ""sign of things to come"" without ever explaining the baby's significance to the audience.Unfortunately, the Cylons just don't work as the main villains. To put it bluntly, they're boring and not particularly threatening after the first few episodes. The idea of biological machines is never really explained satisfactorily - the Cylons appear to be exact copies of humans, even feeling human emotions, and act nothing like machines. Yet, they're supposed to be machines bent on conquering humans? The male Cylons are portrayed as boring and dull while the female Cylons are either slutty or overly emotional. In this season, the Cylons are shown to be a bunch of goofy religious fanatics and the threat factor is almost completely eliminated.Overall, I love individual episodes of BSG, but I don't like the larger story or the Cylons. Individual episodes can have great character moments or engage in deep moral questions. However, when character and morals take a backseat, the series flounders. Still, it's definitely must-see television for sci-fi fans.",4,gritty sci-fi at its best,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,2827,"['Ron', 'Moore', 'one', 'brains', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'took', 'darker', 'view', 'sci-fi', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'series', 'generally', 'positive', 'results', ""n't"", 'Star', 'Trek', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'fact', 'tough', 'compare', 'BSG', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'in-depth', 'story', 'arc', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'realistic', 'special', 'effects', 'pseudo-documentary', 'cinematic', 'style', 'create', 'unique', 'experience.Unlike', 'Star', 'Trek', 'BSG', 'depict', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'vision', 'humanity', 'future', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'race', 'evil', 'robots', 'called', 'Cylons', 'attack', '12', 'human', 'colonies', 'leaving', 'only', 'few', 'tens', 'thousands', 'humans', 'left', 'galaxy', 'humans', 'band', 'together', 'convey', 'ships', 'search', 'Earth.Amongst', 'main', 'characters', 'acting', 'ranges', 'good', 'excellent', 'particular', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Admiral', 'Adama', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'conveying', 'burdens', 'command', 'first', 'saw', 'Olmos', 'Detective', 'Gaff', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'star', 'TV', 'series', 'really', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'Laura', 'Roslin', 'also', 'plaudits', 'perhaps', 'most', 'convincing', 'female', 'president', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'TV.As', 'much', 'like', 'individual', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'meta-plot', 'whole', 'somewhat', 'ridiculous', 'Season', '2', 'ventured', 'heavily', 'pseudo-religious', 'nonsense', 'have', 'nothing', 'religion', 'use', 'religious', 'metaphors', 'BSG', 'was', 'always', 'bit', 'too', 'nose', 'Oddly', 'show', ""n't"", 'use', 'religion', 'talk', 'morality', 'way', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'often', 'series', 'morality', 'plays', 'rather', 'plot', 'devices', 'Season', '2', 'president', 'running', 'around', 'looking', 'Earth', 'based', 'religious', 'prophecies', 'Meanwhile', 'everybody', 'baby', 'human', 'Cylon', 'sign', 'things', 'come', 'ever', 'explaining', 'baby', 'significance', 'audience.Unfortunately', 'Cylons', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'main', 'villains', 'put', 'bluntly', ""'re"", 'boring', 'not', 'particularly', 'threatening', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'idea', 'biological', 'machines', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'satisfactorily', 'Cylons', 'appear', 'be', 'exact', 'copies', 'humans', 'even', 'feeling', 'human', 'emotions', 'act', 'nothing', 'machines', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'machines', 'bent', 'conquering', 'humans', 'male', 'Cylons', 'are', 'portrayed', 'boring', 'dull', 'female', 'Cylons', 'are', 'slutty', 'overly', 'emotional', 'season', 'Cylons', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'bunch', 'goofy', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'threat', 'factor', 'almost', 'completely', 'eliminated.Overall', 'love', 'individual', 'episodes', 'BSG', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'larger', 'story', 'Cylons', 'Individual', 'episodes', 'can', 'have', 'great', 'character', 'moments', 'engage', 'deep', 'moral', 'questions', 'However', 'when', 'character', 'morals', 'take', 'backseat', 'series', 'flounders', 'Still', 'definitely', 'must-see', 'television', 'sci-fi', 'fans']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

Much as Joss Whedon's Firefly changed the way we saw space battle sequences (with small ships frequently out of focus and not in the center of the screen, mostly silence or mininal music, even during mass explosions, etc), this series changes the way characters are displayed.All the characters of this movie, from the clone of the woman who killed the commander, to the hotshot pilot who sleeps around and smokes cigars, is a flawed character that can easily be sympathized with.Every episode seems to take the perspective of a character, and draws us in.To talk a bit about the episodes, the first quarter of the season is spent solving the cliff hangers from season 1.  No fifteen minute resolutions here.  Our heroes must save the life of Adama while fleeing the cylons.  Starbuck and Helo are trapped on Caprica without a way out and with dwindling supplies & hope.  On Kobol, a team awaits rescue while fleeing a cylon platoon.There's also plenty of intrigue, steamy romantic subplots and fast paced action in every episode.About halfway throught the season, the crew is reunited on a new quest, and some of the series best episodes come out.First, Home, a two part episode filled with great cameos (Ajax from The Warriors movie and the guy who played Apollo in the first Galactica unite!) sets us up for the climax of the season.Best episode is ""flight of the Phoenix"", in which the desperate crew creates a new viper out of spare parts and moonshine.There's a huge showdown with the cylons, a nosy reporter who wants answers to earlier problems, a pregnant stranger, and the return of old friends before the season ends, again with a cliffhanger.If you missed season 1 of this show, you can be forgiven, but only if you watch season 2.  This is one of my favorite shows of all time, and in my humblest of opinions, it would be a shame if you missed out on what is one of, if not the best science fiction show ever.Cheverinsky!",5,"Even better than Season 1, I thought that would be impossible",1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,2192,"['Season', 'one', 'had', 'skip', 'day', 'work', 'sit', 'Season', '2', 'amazing', 'science', 'fiction', 'epic', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'best', 'acted', 'most', 'exciting', 'shows', 'science', 'fiction', 'history.This', 'series', 'set', 'new', 'bar', 'science', 'fiction', 'Much', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Firefly', 'changed', 'way', 'saw', 'space', 'battle', 'sequences', 'small', 'ships', 'frequently', 'focus', 'not', 'center', 'screen', 'mostly', 'silence', 'mininal', 'music', 'even', 'mass', 'explosions', 'etc', 'series', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'characters', 'movie', 'clone', 'woman', 'who', 'killed', 'commander', 'hotshot', 'pilot', 'who', 'around', 'smokes', 'cigars', 'flawed', 'character', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'sympathized', 'with.Every', 'episode', 'take', 'perspective', 'character', 'in.To', 'talk', 'bit', 'episodes', 'first', 'quarter', 'season', 'spent', 'solving', 'cliff', 'hangers', 'season', '1', 'fifteen', 'minute', 'resolutions', 'here', 'heroes', 'must', 'save', 'life', 'Adama', 'fleeing', 'cylons', 'Starbuck', 'Helo', 'are', 'trapped', 'Caprica', 'way', 'dwindling', 'supplies', 'hope', 'Kobol', 'team', 'rescue', 'fleeing', 'cylon', 'platoon.There', 'also', 'plenty', 'intrigue', 'steamy', 'romantic', 'subplots', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'episode.About', 'halfway', 'throught', 'season', 'crew', 'reunited', 'new', 'quest', 'series', 'best', 'come', 'out.First', 'Home', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'filled', 'great', 'cameos', 'Ajax', 'Warriors', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Apollo', 'first', 'Galactica', 'unite', 'up', 'climax', 'season.Best', 'episode', 'flight', 'Phoenix', 'desperate', 'crew', 'new', 'viper', 'spare', 'parts', 'huge', 'showdown', 'cylons', 'nosy', 'reporter', 'who', 'answers', 'earlier', 'problems', 'pregnant', 'stranger', 'return', 'old', 'friends', 'season', 'again', 'cliffhanger.If', 'missed', 'season', '1', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'only', 'watch', 'season', '2', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'time', 'humblest', 'opinions', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'missed', 'out', 'what', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'show', 'ever.Cheverinsky']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

The immediate comparison to Star Wars was inevitable.  However, at the time it was a costly weekly series to make, and it was spectacular in its effects and stories.  Those old European capes were tremendous.Galactica: 1980 came after the original series attempting to tie up certain things; the earth was the 1980's.  Unfortunately, this one lost the essence of what made the original series. The true core was missing.The reincarnation of Battlestar Galactica gave the current generation a humanity struggling for survival against a ruthless enemy.  Parallels to current events since 911 played throughout the series.The last episodes showed this ruthless enemy with a human face.  Battlestar Galactica never dealt with pure black and white reality.  Like current societies, reality is always chromatic in nature.Each week of the last season built toward the climax of a daring adventure which Daybreak adeptly brings full circle. This full circle of life and death is brilliantly displayed in the last hour.Visions, prophecies, faith, angels, death, resurrection and other religious overtones are well crafted into each episode, especially in Daybreak.  The tension, the fear, the mutiny and the intrigue are all here.Humanity, both sides of it as demonstrated in the human and Cylon counterparts, is displayed with clarity in this season.  Sadness is an under lying motif in these final episodes which one cannot escape.Bravery, courage and love are dealt with beautifully.  Of courses, there are surprises and twists along this journey to the lost tribe and a new home for the remnants of humanity.The last ten minutes is a bit controversial for some people, but for those of us who grew up watching and reading science fiction, it was a pleasant surprise, a rare treat.  It was like coming home from school to find chocolate chip cookies and cold milk waiting on the kitchen counter.  The milieu is still scented with the aroma of freshly baked cookies and just-poured milk.So, enjoy and keep a box of Kleenex nearby for those moments which demand a human reaction.

Arnold,"[3, 5]","Okay, once again, I did not see BSG's final season on broadcast TV; I did see all the way through season 3 and then saw nothing afterward, until buying the whole series, which I watched from the beginning to get caught up, reminded and prepared for the final season. I review 4.0 elsewhere...The second half of the final season picks up where we left off and continues the final arc of the story to Earth with an unexpected twist (no spoilers here). The revelations continue and many are not predicable, which I like. And they weren't stupid either, which I really like.Without giving anything away, the final resolution did not take me by surprise as I had long ago surmised the way they would ""end"" the story, which is the only way it really could have been done.After finishing, I thought back to some of the situations in previous episodes and seasons and saw the ""clues"", which were often hidden in plain sight. It's been a few weeks since I wrapped up watching the series and while at first it was a rather satisfying ending, now I find it left me a little wanting. Perhaps that is what they wanted. I can't say. But it was really the best ending possible.The epilogue at the very end was unexpected and added a very interesting question to the whole cycle of events.There is a bit of a hint of an upcoming movie ""The Plan"" that revisits the tag line in the opening, ""... and they have a plan..."" The producers admit it meant nothing at the outset, but became important as the series progressed. They realized the ominous tag line actually came back to bite them and they had to follow through. In the series, we learn of it in a way, but the film is supposed to flesh that out. And now that we know most everything we need to know, I'm sure there will be further surprises introduced as part of the ""back story""...Think Asimov's Foundation Series books four, five and six. The Foundation Trilogy stood alone, but the added trilogy of books gave us more depth and understanding in retrospective fashion - we already knew the principles, now we learn more of their motivations, and what spurred them to do the thing they did.If the production values hold up, it should be a good addition.",5,"The conclusion?

Week after week this adult drama delivers the goods, rewarding the viewer with some of the tightest writing, finest acting, and best visual effects the small screen can hold.There's plenty of excellent reviews here and a quick Google search will turn up an endless list of professional reviewers who all agree that this incarnation of Battlestar Galactica is not only great science fiction, it's just great entertainment. I hold with the camp who believes that you do not need to be a science fiction fan to enjoy this show. In fact all the show requires is a bit of concentration and a little loyalty to let the story develop over time. Those who do so are richly rewarded with story lines that reveal themselves logically and with stunning depth rather than the usual ""wrap it up in an hour"" pace of network television.For anyone yet to sample this brilliant work, I'd suggest a couple of starting points to get your feet wet. In the first season (available for download on iTunes by episode), the episodes ""33"" and ""The Hand of God"" contain the best of what the show has to offer. In this set (also available by episode on iTunes) the episodes ""Pegasus"" and ""Scattered"" will do the trick. Get a taste there, then come back and buy here. It's well worth every cent. In fact it's a bargain.For those of us who grew up in the 70s and endured the Galactica of old-- including its bug-eyed aliens, its robot doggy, its simpleton plots and group hugs and recycled visual effects week after week -- this show is for us. It carries forth the best elements of the old train wreck and sprinkles delicious tastes of various old episodes throughout.But again, don't worry if you've never heard the name before and have no idea what the old show was about. In fact don't worry if you have no patience for the sci fi genre. This is entertainment that transcends its genre to become what most TV shows aspire to become: must-see-TV, watercooler TV, call it what you will.With the luck of the gods (God? ;-) the writers will keep this up for years to come.",5,The best show on television.

945332,A1S1JC7LTBZAH2,B000BNI90Y,Hal Jordan,"[2, 4]","I was knocked out by the original miniseries and by most of season 1.  The first few episodes of season 2 as they finished off most of the story arcs from season 1 were also pretty good.  The rest of season 2 was disappointing.  There were a couple of real clinkers (did anyone like the Cylon filming the documentary episode?) and the series got noticeably darker and the main characters became less appealing.  A realistic approach, I suppose, but, hey guys, this is supposed to be entertainment.  You can't expect viewers to stick with you for five years unless the main characters are more appealing than these folks turned out to be.  But my real gripe with this series is the number of cavernous plot holes.  Here is a list off the top of my head, starting with the most glaring and then a few others:1.  Why isn't the Pegasus (and its fighters) vulnerable to the Cylon's logic bombs?  The miniseries makes a big deal over Galactica surviving only because its computers were somehow not linked together and because it relied on other antique technology.  Other battlestars and fighters were destroyed in the Cylon attack because they were susceptible to logic bombs.  This idea comes up again in a season 1 episode where the Galactica has to temporarily link its computers and has only about 10 minutes to perform a calculation and jump to another star system before the effects of a logic bomb destroys it.  All of this is forgotten when the Pegasus appears.  The story is that the Pegasus escaped the initial Cylon invasion by jumping before it was destroyed.  Ok, but since then it has apparently been routinely fighting Cylon ships.  Why haven't the Cylons used their logic bombs on the Pegasus?  The producers could have dealt with this by telling us that the Pegasus's computers were configured like the Galatica's (although that would be a little lame because Galatica is supposed to have been unique), but apparently they couldn't be bothered.  Who cares about continuity?2.  Does Gaius's Cylon detector work or not?  When Gaius comes under pressure from Adama to develop a Cylon detector, he develops one with the help of Number 6, using a nuclear device given to him by Adama.  Apparently it works, because it detects that Sharon is a Cylon.  But then it either stops working or Gaius decides to pretend it doesn't work.  Ok, but then why don't Adama and Laura Roslin pressure him to keep working on it, since everyone believes there are additional undetected Cylon agents in the fleet?  Shouldn't this be a top priority or at least mentioned at some point?  Related point:  If the Cylon detector isn't working and Gaius has abandoned trying to perfect it, why doesn't Adama demand that Gaius return the nuclear device?  Another related point:  How is Gaius able to smuggle the nuclear device to the Number 6 in hiding when we have been told that the fleet has nuclear detectors?3.  Where does Starbuck get the yellow tape and the time to use it to spell out her name on the underside of the Cylon fighter?  In the episode where Starbuck crashes on a planet and comes on a crashed Cylon fighter, she is shown to be out of oxygen when she finally figures out how to access the oxygen line in the fighter.  But then how does she manage to get under the plane to spell out her name in yellow tape on the underside of the fighter?  Is she supposed to make a large number of trips while holding her breath?  Related point:  We are later told that the Cylon fighters are living things.  Is the one Starbuck finds dead?  If so, how can it fly for her?  If not, why doesn't it fly away?4.  Why don't the Cylons do a better job of guarding the Arrow of Apollo on Caprica?  It becomes evident that the Cylons are well versed in the holy text describing the Arrow of Apollo and, apparently, believe in the truth of the text.  So, it's hard to believe they don't know what the arrow is, and that they leave it unguarded in a museum for Starbuck to easily find.  Related point:  Is it believable that Starbuck and Helo would spend so much time arguing about what to do about Sharon, rather than getting back in the Cylon fighter and getting the heck out of there?  Another related point:  In the next episode, how do they all get out of the Tomb of Athena?  The door closes on them and they are, apparently, transported to earth - or a vision of earth.  How do they get out of the tomb?  Another related point:  After all the time and trouble to get the directions to earth, why is there so little mention of it - only one or two passing references - in subsequent episodes?  Wouldn't this have been the dominant theme of conversation and shouldn't there be more discussion of how they can use the information from the Tomb of Athena to try to find earth?5.  How does the Pegasus get supplies in the time before it encounters Galactica?  A big deal is made in early episodes about how pressed Galactica is for supplies and on how dependent it is on supplies from the civilian ships in the fleet.  How then does Pegasus, which has no civilian fleet, get supplied?  In fact, shouldn't there be some discussion of whether the fleet is actually producing food or other supplies?  In an early episode, food is very short; subsequently, that problem is forgotten - or solved in a way that is not explained.6.  How can language, hairstyles, and so on be so similar to twenty-first century earth?  The show occasionally bows to the idea that the episodes are supposed to be taking place in another time or universe, as with the pyramid game, clipping the corners off of documents, and the use of the word ""frack.""  But how plausible is it that everything else is basically the same as in the current day United States?  I might buy that the soldiers on the Galatica are called ""marines,"" but that they should be nicknamed ""jar heads""?Ok, I have got a lot more, but I'm probably at (or beyond) the limits of anyone's willingness to read this.",3,"Plot holes, plot holes everywhere",1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,5935,"['was', 'knocked', 'out', 'original', 'miniseries', 'most', 'season', '1', 'first', 'few',

It doesn't matter whether you are a ""sci-fi"" fan or not, this is simply one of the best character driven dramas on television or anywhere.  The quality of this show is so high that it easily surpasses most of today's sci-fi movies.  Next to the Firefly/Serenity franchise, this is probably the best sci-fi themed entertainment I've ever seen, and it comes very close to the quality of that incredible series.  What makes it so good is that, like Firefly/Serenity, the characters are SO VERY REAL.  The motivations of both the bad guys and the good guys are so complex that sometimes I wonder whether their roles have been reversed.  Edward James Olmos is a force of nature as Commander Bill Adama.  If he doesn't win an Emmy for Best Actor this year...  Well, that will simply be more proof that the Emmy's are just a popularity contest rather than a measure of quality performance that they should be.  If you haven't seen this show before, start with the mini-series and then the first season (this definitely needs to be watched in order), but the important thing is to START watching it.

When Laura and Bill went off in the raptor it was truyly beautiful and touching, when she died and he put his ring on her finger, well I lost it and had to pause my dvr because I was crying so hard (not an easy feat to get me to cry).

Simply put, Battlestar Galactica is the most amazing show I have ever seen. And the first half of season 2 probably contains some of the strongest episodes of the entire series. Even when not much happens in an episode, they were still done so well, that it's incredibly enjoyable to watch. Highlights include:Scattered: The aftermath of the season 1 finale, although the effects of the catastrophes don't get resolved tidily, but instead tie into the rest of the season.Valley of Darkness: One of the most exciting episodes, incredibly directed and well done. Some amazing scenes here that are really gut-wrenching.The Resistance: A great twist, and new characters introduced.The Farm: An amazingly well done episode, introduces a very intriguing character (who I think should have been in it more after). Also, lots of background for Kara Thrace.Home (Parts 1 and 2): This is a truly wonderful two parter, I could list tons of scenes that really moved me (end of Home Part 1 anyone?)Pegasus: One of the best episodes of the series, introducing the Cain arc (which is Battlestar at it's FINEST). The epitome of why this show is great. The ending of the episode will leave you shocked.I pretty much just listed the entire set. But the first half of season 2 has a consistency in quality that the rest of the sets don't have, and that is why it stands out. The second half of season 2 has some of the best episodes, but also a few episodes that don't live up to Battlestar standards. This set has none of those episodes, every episode is amazing, including ones that I did not list.

The season opener, the two-part ""Resurrection Ship,"" is one of the high points of the series, allowing much breathing room for Michelle Forbes (who gets the best guest starring role of the season as a Col. Kurtz-like admiral) and the most gorgeous special effect of the season, a huge space battle observed by a marooned Apollo from a great distance. The season-ender, ""Lay Down Your Burdens,""  is equally fine, and undergoes what is for TV a very risky move by showing what happens if the fleet settles on a planet for a full year free from Cylon attack.But in-between these high points the middle sags--you can tell everyone's been in space too long. There are stand-alone episodes that are pretty weak, and which always seem to waste perfectly good guest stars like Dana Delaney. Even worse, throughout the year the series writers seem to have run out of complex ethical problems for the characters to face and begin really reaching by going for things like state-supported assassinations, state-supported election-rigging, child-selling... it begins to seem a bit much. You can tell the writers really want to get that fleet to New Caprica to work out a new narrative model. There's still excellent acting work from the main cast, particularly Katee Sackhoff who gets a real workout for her character ""Starbuck"" in the one really fine stand-alone episode, ""Scar.""This set seems to have cut down a bit on some of the nicer amenties of the previous BG season sets: there are no menus for episode scenes nor for episode summaries. Most bizarre of all, the commentaries are done by podcasts that have been done in the house of the series developer Ronald D. Moore, and you often find his comments overwhelmed by the sounds of dogs  barking, garbage trucks compacting, and vacuum cleaners running. Apparently when these podcasts were originally aired series fans e-mailed in to complain about the excess ambient noise, and he actually whines about these complaints on subsequent podcasts.

As a fan of the show, I did not want to spend money on the other seasons, but 2.5 is well worth it.  This season contains, in my opinion, the best episode of Battlestar Galactica thus far.  Though I'm sure season three will be phenominal.  The best episodes I speak of are as follow:Resurrection: where Adama learns of the Admiral's true nature, haunting, but still human.  Both commanders of the warships learn that military might is not the only thing that governs a great leader.  Nearly resorting to the dirty work of assisnations, both commanders succumb to their humanity.Scar: Frack, that Starbuck is one sly fighter ace.  Though a depressing episode as she drowns herself in booze while her wingman is high on uppers, this is one of the most intense episodes as the fligt squadron hunt for the notorious Cylon fighter, Scar.  This is an episode of tragedy and intrigue.  And Lee gets to see a bit of Starbuck's booty.Lay Down Your Burdens:  By far the most shocking two part episode of them all.  Dr. Baltar, the decieptful vice president in league with a former terrorist, wins the presidential election after Colonel Tye riggs the election in Roslin's favor.  The entire fleet settles on a desolate world to jump start the human population again.  Tye and Starbuck are best friends?  Lee and D are hitched as they sale on the Pegasus?  Starbuck has long hair?

945350,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B000BNI90Y,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[3, 10]","This second half of the second Battlestar Galactica season is still a bit on the dark side. The fleet is still running but it is also bedeviled not only by Cylons but also by civilians with radically differing agendas. Having the Cylons be experts at playing mind games does not help matters.This season picks up a few of the story ideas from the original series, The PEGASUS and Adm. Cain are examples, but takes the basics of the ideas and goes in completely new directions. The Cylons still seem implacable enemies but occasionally there seem to be defectors...or are they merely fifth columnists?Episode synopses follow:Pegasus - The Galactica crew gets readings of a large ship approaching and launch a response in their belief that it is a Cylon basestar. Instead, it turns out to be the Battlestar Pegasus commanded by the legendary Adm. Cain. At first all rejoice to learn of this additional surviving (and potent) ship of humanity but things get tense quickly. As an admiral, the new arrival takes precedence over Adama. The admiral is a hard case also, who brooks no arguments and tolerates nothing not to her liking. She believes Adama has been too soft and orders the crews of the two battlestars to be integrated. This leads to friction and worse. The Admiral has her own cylon interrogator and rape is one of the preferred methods. When the crew chief learns of this, he and a lieutenant intervene with deadly results. The resulting summary court martial pushes Adama over the edge and he is willing to use force to get his people back. The episode ends with the fighters of the two ships headed for the opposite ship with blood in the eyes. This was the cliffhanger that ended the previous set. It is presented here with some small additions that do nothing to change or enhance the story line.Resurrection Ship part 1 - As the last cliffhanger ended, the Pegasus and Galactica had launched vipers at each other in a very tense standoff. As this episode opens, all is confusion as the fighters on each side wait for instructions as to whether they are to attack the opposing Battlestar. When an unknown ship shows up on the screens and is presumed to be Cylon, the differences are temporarily put aside as all go for the intruder. The intruder turns out to be Starbuck who is back with vital intelligence about the mysterious Cylon ship. Upon interrogation of the prisoners, it turns out to be a Resurrection ship, used to recycle the consciousness of Cylons who have been killed. Adama and Cain temporarily put aside their differences to put together a joint strike but neither trusts the other. When Adama learns that Cain killed or abandoned the civilians who were with her, he is even more set against her. As the episode closes, the joint strike is being planned but each is planning to use the victory celebration to bring about the downfall of the other.Resurrection Ship part 2 - The battle plans are made and each of the human commanders has made arrangements for the assassination of the other commander after the battle with the Cylons. Now it is time for the battle plan to unfold and take the fight to the enemy. The plans against the Cylons go well but the aftermath is not what is expected with the assassination plots. Things get messier when Baltar, the arch-traitor, reverts to type and lets loose a menace.Epiphanies - The president finally seems to be on her death bed with the cancer ravaging her body. She is distrustful of Baltar and of the Cylon prisoner and orders the foetus she is carrying to be aborted. The Cylon present in Baltar's mind wants to stop this, of course. Meanwhile, there is a growing element within the fleet which wants to negotiate with the Cylons and looks to the military as the enemy. They conduct sabotage and acts of terrorism. As the president is about to die, the phantom Cylon tries to talk Baltar into further betrayals of humanity but, surprisingly, he refuses. He even manages to save the president and the Cylon foetus. He also manages to set humanity up for yet another betrayal.Black Market - Shortages in the colonial fleet have led to a thriving black market operation. That such a market would evolve is inevitable but the situation is getting out of control. The president and the fleet finally step in when the commander of the Pegasus is murdered over a black market deal and Capt. Apollo is tasked to investigate the matter. In doing so, he endangers a woman he has become close to and learns more about her that he wishes.Scar - The fleet finds itself desperately in need of strategic minerals in order to manufacture replacements for losses to the Cylons and is fortunate enough to find a system where those minerals can be mined. It means staying put for a while but the following Cylon fleet has been decimated and that gives them a bit of breathing room. There are still some to contend with in the local system, however. One of them is called Scar. He has a reputation for killing Viper pilots. The pilots must confront him, though, in order to protect mining operations. Much of this story is taken up with Starbuck engaged in a clash of wills with another pilot. Each considers herself to be the best and wants to prove it. Starbuck is facing memories of all of those who have been killed before and the up and coming hotshot is overfilled with bravado. Their personalities clash. Meanwhile, Scar is racking up more kills.Sacrifice - When word gets out to the civilian part of the fleet that there is a Cylon prisoner aboard the Galactica, people are disturbed. One group, seeking vengeance, decides to turn to terror. They take hostages on one of the recreational ships and threaten to kill them all unless the Cylon is turned over to them. The hostages include several notables included Capt. Apollo, the President's aide and the wife of Col. Tigh. Everyone knows that negotiating with terrorists just causes more problems but things seem less clear cut when loved ones are the hostages. It's a mess and friendly fire makes things worse.The Captain's Hand - The death of Admiral Cain and the Commander of the Pegasus have left a hole in the command structure of that ship. Admiral Adama appoints the senior surviving officer to command but he is an engineer, not a combat leader. He is good with machines but not people. This causes friction and problems that only get worse when two of the Pegasus's raptors go missing. When the new commander goes looking for them, they get bushwhacked. All of this takes place during the midst of a political crisis in which Baltar shows that he is able not only to betray all of humanity but also close associates as well.Downloaded - This is a confusing episode. It has become time for the Cylon prisoner to deliver her baby. It's a bit premature but the modified aspects apparently make it quite hardy. This poses some ethical problems. What should be done with a newborn which is only half human and whose other half is of a species trying to wipe out humanity? How will the Cylon sympathizer react? How will the Cylon haters react? Is there a danger to the fleet? This little drama takes placed interposed with another taking place back on Cylon held Caprica. Number 6 and Number 8 are both downloaded and inhabiting new bodies. Both seem to be showing some sympathy for humanity. In a reversal that never gets explained, Number 6 has Baltar flashing into her head making snide remarks instead of the other way around. Both are view with suspicion by the other Cylons who have not been contaminated by close contact with humanity especially when they show some sympathy for the human resistance movement.Lay Down Your Burdens Part 1 - Starbuck finally gets what she has been wanting. A rescue mission is sent to Caprica and she is the leader. It's a daring plan but they are counting on some help from Sharon, the Cylon prisoner. They face many jumps and expect to lose some raptors along the way and they manage to lose one on the very first jump. That divides the story line. Starbuck and her rescue team manage to find the last free humans but are attacked by Cylons before they can get back to their ships. Therein hangs the first story line until the next episode but, just as important, the wayward ship has found a planet. It is habitable, barely, and it is hard to find by virtue of being hidden in a nebula. This has big political implications. Much of the civilian part of the fleet is weary of life aboard ship. They want to be on a planet. Safety does not register in their minds. This gives Baltar's faltering campaign for the presidency a new boost when he comes out in opposition to the president and in support of settling ""New Caprica"".Lay Down Your Burdens Part 2 - As the last episode ended, Starbuck and her rescue team are in a standoff with Cylons. It is just a matter of time until they are overrun. Miraculously, the Cylons just seem to give up. One of the rescuees declares a miracle and all head back to the fleet. Baltar's position on settlement has boosted his campaign. Now it looks like he might win even though all sane people know that would be a disaster. The situation is so grave that the powers that be even consider trying to steal the election. The bad guy, however, wins and settlement proceeds. Then comes a long blank of almost a year. The people on New Caprica are barely surviving while Baltar lives a life of luxury. The fleet barely has enough people aboard the ships to keep them running. That's when the Cylons show up. The fleet jumps, leaving most of the people behind, and Baltar is left to surrender. So ends the season with a cliffhanger.",3,Still on the Dark Side,1164153600,"11 22, 2006",2006,9623,"['second', 'half', 'second', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'season', 'still', 'bit', 'dark', 'side',

I think if this were originally made in the U.S., various ""interest groups"" and ""boards"" would have put pressure on them to limit the drinking by the characters. I like the fact that the characters are total booze-hounds, because I think this is probably what would happen to people locked in a metal box, being chased across the galaxies by robot killing machines, and who have to worry about dying every day. The XO of the ""Gallactica"" is a total 'lush', and is entrusted with a multi-trillion dollar intergalactic battleship. OK...Another thing I noticed is, in the future, women and men have the same mechanical/spacial/combat abilities. For instance, the best fighter (Viper) pilots are some women. I am ok with that, but I just would like to note it here. Actually, this entire series is kind of progressive from the point of view of showing women in high positions of power, and in combat, at least as strong as the men.

But ""Battlestar Galactica - Season 2.5"" still gets high marks from me for the intense battle of wills between Michelle Forbes's Admiral Cain and Edward James Olmos's Commander Adama, which will determine how the surviving Colonial fleet will protect the humans fleeing from their merciless Cylon foe. This second half of Season Two is important too in playing out the consequences of Boomer's (Grace Park) pregnancy, especially after revelations of her less-than-human origins disclosed during the first season and first half of the second season. President Laura Roslin's  (Mary McDonnell) relations with Commander Adama remain important dramatic fare too, though now the emphasis lies more on her incurable illness and the consequences it might have for a potential successor like Gaius Balter (James Callis).Is ""Battlestar Galactica"" the best science fiction television drama? No, it is quite simply the best drama airing now on American television. Series creator Ronald D. Moore and his crew of writers and technicians have done a fine job keeping intact the edgy, gritty qualities of Season One which made ""Battlestar Galactica"" popular with viewers. However, I still regard ""Babylon 5"" - especially from its second through fourth seasons - as the finest science fiction drama ever to air on television. ""Babylon 5"" series creator J. Michael Straczynski wove such a fascinating, elaborate web of drama and fascinating back-story, with ample religious connotations from Christianity and Buddhism, and discrete references to such science fiction and fantasy classics as ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Prisoner"" television series, which has yet to be equalled by Ronald Moore and his crew. Still, I strongly recommend acquiring ""Battlestar Galactica - Season 2.5"" to those unfamiliar with this series, as well as loyal fans. You will be well rewarded with ten hours of gripping, intense drama that deserve recognition for being the finest currently airing on American television.",5,Second Half of a Fine Season Two for Battlestar Galactica,1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,2091,"['Hopefully', 'halves', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'second', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'issued', 'together', 'one', 'DVD', 'set', 'soon', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Season', '2.5', 'still', 'high', 'marks', 'intense', 'battle', 'wills', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Commander', 'Adama', 'will', 'determine', 'how', 'surviving', 'Colonial', 'fleet', 'will', 'protect', 'humans', 'fleeing', 'merciless', 'Cylon', 'foe', 'second', 'half', 'Season', 'Two', 'important', 'too', 'playing', 'out', 'consequences', 'Boomer', 'Grace', 'Park', 'pregnancy', 'especially', 'revelations', 'less-than-human', 'origins', 'disclosed', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'half', 'second', 'season', 'President', 'Laura', 'Roslin', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'relations', 'Commander', 'Adama', 'remain', 'important', 'dramatic', 'fare', 'too', 'though', 'now', 'emphasis', 'more', 'incurable', 'illness', 'consequences', 'might', 'have', 'potential', 'successor', 'Gaius', 'Balter', 'James', 'Callis', '.Is', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'television', 'drama', 'No', 'quite', 'simply', 'best', 'drama', 'airing', 'now', 'American', 'television', 'Series', 'creator', 'Ronald', 'D.', 'Moore', 'crew', 'writers', 'technicians', 'have', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'keeping', 'intact', 'edgy', 'gritty', 'qualities', 'Season', 'One', 'made', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'popular', 'viewers', 'However', 'still', 'regard', 'Babylon', '5', 'especially', 'second', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'finest', 'science', 'fiction', 'drama', 'ever', 'air', 'television', 'Babylon', '5', 'series', 'creator', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'wove', 'fascinating', 'elaborate', 'web', 'drama', 'fascinating', 'back-story', 'ample', 'religious', 'connotations', 'Christianity', 'Buddhism', 'discrete', 'references', 'such', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'classics', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Prisoner', 'television', 'series', 'yet', 'be', 'equalled', 'Ronald', 'Moore', 'crew', 'Still', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'acquiring', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Season', '2.5', 'unfamiliar', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'loyal', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'rewarded', 'ten', 'hours', 'gripping', 'intense', 'drama', 'recognition', 'being', 'finest', 'currently', 'airing', 'American', 'television']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

Salinger described sentimentality as (I'm paraphrasing) loving a character more than God loves him; that seems to sum up much of what went wrong with this series.  The creators apparently believe that every little pang of angst their characters feel deserves an episode's (well, many, in fact) worth of development.  Turning Starbuck into an angel is an extreme example of this.  Clearly, the show's creators love her, but she is a selfish, maladjusted annoying character from the second season to the very end.  Struggling through the series, I found myself time and again groaning inwardly, thinking, ""Oh no.  Starbuck's emoting again.""The ending could not be more implausible. They finally reach a planet that isn't earth (which of course has been destroyed) but which they call earth.  They abandon all their technology--just like that--all their medicine, tools, and so on, to live like the natives.  They have no apparent skills that will allow them to adopt a stone-age existence, but we are led to believe they do.  Furthermore, instead of sticking together to rely on one another and perhaps protect themselves against natives that might or might not be hostile, they scatter.  Sorry, folks, but intelligent people would not do this.I kept watching this series hoping that it would regain some of its original glory. (Also, frankly, I wanted to know how it ended.)

945357,A2BHAF6HJ727UW,B000BNI90Y,Jonathan Snooks,"[7, 17]","I really enjoyed BSG, the unexpected plot developments, the philosophical issues involved in the metanarrative, the fighting, and even some of the romantic elements which I felt were not overdone.  Most of the individual story arcs were good, there were a few episodes that dragged however.  The character development was good.Now for the bad:  Why would EVERYONE have decided to abandon technology?  And even if they had abandoned technology why abandon civilization?  It took them over 100,000 years to become civilized again?  Absurd.  There should still have been writing and basic craftsmanship, and yet, even with the most biased and liberal methods for deriving dates no one has pinned a date that old on any written document.  It does not square with anyone's idea of written history.  While I was glad the Agathons survived, I don't understand why Hera's Mitochondrial DNA would have become dominant to the point of her being declared Mitochondrial Eve.  And as to the Agathons settling in the area of Tanzania, there are no white or mongoloid (Asian) races or civilizations indigenous to sub-Saharan Africa.When I first started watching the series I supposed when they mentioned they were looking for earth that they would reach modern earth.  At that point they would either assimilate and live at a more primitive level or perhaps have a conflict with modern man.  I assumed that assimilation was what would occur.  That was the obvious conclusion when they said they were looking for earth.  I was relieved when they found earth and it was destroyed because I assumed they would move onto higher things.  That assumption was based on the mystery surrounding the final cylons, the prophecies, and the visions.  The visions of the opera house were dismissed in a sloppy and anti-climactic fashion.  It did not involve a mysterious setting, reveal any secrets, or involve any action on the part of the final five.  The prophecies were left unaddressed, and ultimately the human and cylon civilizations were destroyed.  What was the point in that?  So instead of ending on a high note, it was almost like they just blew off writing an ending.  The series ends with thousands of years of barbarism and because of the barbarism none of the lessons were learned.  They reverted back to writing in the obvious ending, which was done in a sloppy and uninspired way.  The series ended with a whimper rather than a bang.  When they showed earth from space I almost felt sick and nearly turned it off, but the character development in previous seasons was done so well that I wanted to see what happened to the characters I had come to like.  The Agathons and Gaias Baltar were my favorites, so obviously I was pleased that they lived, although the pleasure was blunted by the fact that they would be lost in a sea of barbarism.They never did reveal the source of the cylon religion, which they had when they were still metal robots.  They never said why the 13th tribe was nuked.  They implied that they nuked themselves but never stated why or how.  Why was Starbuck resurrected and how?  I also didn't like how they just cut Deanna out, right, she stayed on the ruined planet.  A poor way to write off her character.  And Leoban was cut out for almost the entire second half of the season.  I got the impression that they just wanted to terminate the series, so they rushed to close it and did so in a poor way as a result.To sum it up, and obvious ending, with many abandoned plot lines which had the potential to be really great.  They ruined the series.  It would have been better if they ended the series with reaching the burnt out ""Earth,"" which was actually the real climax of the series, everything that followed was a downhill plunge into a blow off ending.I found the ending so disappointing and anti-climactic that I will not be following Caprica.  I did hear that Edward James Olmos is supposedly going to be working on some sequels.  I only hope that if so then he manages to patch some of the plot holes and logical inconsistencies.",2,Dissapointing ending to an otherwise great series.,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,4050,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'BSG', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'developments', 'philosophical', 'issues', 'involved', 'metanarrative', 'fighting', 'even', 'romantic', 'elements', 'felt', 'were', 'not', 'overdone', 'Most', 'individual', 'story', 'arcs', 'were', 'good', 'were', 'few', 'episodes', 'dragged', 'however', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'good.Now', 'bad', 'Why', 'would', 'EVERYONE', 'have', 'decided', 'abandon', 'technology', 'even', 'had', 'abandoned', 'technology', 'why', 'civilization', 'took', 'over', '100,000', 'years', 'become', 'civilized', 'again', 'Absurd', 'should', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'writing', 'basic', 'craftsmanship', 'yet', 'even', 'most', 'biased', 'liberal', 'methods', 'deriving', 'one', 'pinned', 'date', 'old', 'written', 'document', 'not', 'square', 'anyone', 'idea', 'written', 'history', 'was', 'glad', 'Agathons', 'survived', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Hera', 'Mitochondrial', 'DNA', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'dominant', 'point', 'being', 'declared', 'Mitochondrial', 'Eve', 'Agathons', 'settling', 'area', 'Tanzania', 'are', 'white', 'mongoloid', 'Asian', 'races', 'civilizations', 'indigenous', 'sub-Saharan', 'Africa.When', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'series', 'supposed', 'when', 'mentioned', 'were', 'looking', 'earth', 'would', 'reach', 'modern', 'earth', 'point', 'would', 'either', 'assimilate', 'live', 'more', 'primitive', 'level', 'perhaps', 'have', 'conflict', 'modern', 'man', 'assumed', 'assimilation', 'was', 'what', 'would', 'occur', 'was', 'obvious', 'conclusion', 'when', 'said', 'were', 'looking', 'earth', 'was', 'relieved', 'when', 'found', 'earth', 'was', 'destroyed', 'assumed', 'would', 'move', 'higher', 'things', 'assumption', 'was', 'based', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'final', 'cylons', 'prophecies', 'visions', 'visions', 'opera', 'house', 'were', 'dismissed', 'sloppy', 'anti-climactic', 'fashion', 'did', 'not', 'involve', 'mysterious', 'setting', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'involve', 'action', 'part', 'final', 'five', 'prophecies', 'were', 'left', 'unaddressed', 'ultimately', 'human', 'cylon', 'civilizations', 'were', 'destroyed', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'So', 'instead', 'ending', 'high', 'note', 'was', 'almost', 'just', 'blew', 'off', 'writing', 'ending', 'series', 'thousands', 'years', 'barbarism', 'barbarism', 'none', 'lessons', 'were', 'learned', 'reverted', 'back', 'writing', 'obvious', 'ending', 'was', 'done', 'sloppy', 'uninspired', 'way', 'series', 'ended', 'whimper', 'rather', 'bang', 'When', 'showed', 'earth', 'space', 'almost', 'felt', 'sick', 'nearly', 'turned', 'off', 'character', 'development', 'previous', 'seasons', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'had', 'come', 'like', 'Agathons', 'Gaias', 'Baltar', 'were', 'favorites', 'obviously', 'was', 'pleased', 'lived', 'pleasure', 'was', 'blunted', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'sea', 'barbarism.They', 'never', 'did', 'reveal', 'source', 'cylon', 'religion', 'had', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'metal', 'robots', 'never', 'said', 'why', '13th', 'tribe', 'was', 'nuked', 'implied', 'nuked', 'never', 'stated', 'why', 'how', 'Why', 'was', 'Starbuck', 'resurrected', 'how', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'just', 'cut', 'Deanna', 'out', 'right', 'stayed', 'ruined', 'planet', 'poor', 'way', 'write', 'off', 'character', 'Leoban', 'was', 'cut', 'out', 'almost', 'entire', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'got', 'impression', 'just', 'wanted', 'terminate', 'series', 'rushed', 'close', 'did', 'so', 'poor', 'way', 'result.To', 'sum', 'up', 'obvious', 'ending', 'many', 'abandoned', 'plot', 'lines', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'really', 'great', 'ruined', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'ended', 'series', 'reaching', 'burnt', 'Earth', 'was', 'actually', 'real', 'climax', 'series', 'everything', 'followed', 'was', 'downhill', 'plunge', 'blow', 'off', 'ending.I', 'found', 'ending', 'so', 'disappointing', 'anti-climactic', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'following', 'Caprica', 'did', 'hear', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'supposedly', 'going', 'be', 'working', 'sequels', 'only', 'hope', 'so', 'then', 'patch', 'plot', 'holes', 'logical', 'inconsistencies']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

I did see a few shows but was immediately turned off with the introduction of the ""monkey in the dog suit"" and the little kid....Now I also understand that this BSG is a ""re-imagining"" of the original but we will address that issue later....I've rated this BSG so high and here are my reasons why:#1 -  Believable CharactersWe, earthlings, are not yet on the run for our lives but the show properly portrays what some us would do if there was a way to escape our world's devastation.The characters go to and physically have restrooms! (Oy, this coming from a Trekker!)People also have ""potty mouths"" so frak this!#2 - The stories deal with real moral issuesHow do we deal with an enemy that looks, feels, a reacts like us?How do we deal with finding out the person you thought you knew or loved was the enemy?How do we deal with issues involving love, dishonesty, family?Gee, this week's loss of pilots and vipers  is a loss of pilots and vipers!!!! ( No mysterious regeneration of pilots and vipers)#3 - Believable technologyBeing a science-fiction lover...the technology is believable in that it does have connections to what is in the realm of the real world...atomic warheads, the Galactica's layout, pilot's bunks, closing doors between rooms and sections etc. Oh, don't forget resources that run out!Lastly the way the show is filmed.

All along the way there are very tough decisions to be made and they are handled in the style that has become familiar with this series.  We even get to see some very interesting footage of what has happened to the original Six who's body died on Caprica and the Sharon who shot Adama.

945366,A1NIEIENEWXCCQ,B000BNI90Y,kaioatey,"[2, 2]","An interesting take on Sci-Fi, is BSG. At it's core are ultra-conservative  values and a fascination with the military. Buddy camaraderie, loyalty, family, military hierarchy, patriotism are endorsed and revered. Abortion is banned. The exiled humans follow their ""scripture"", an unabashedly fundamentalist Biblical plan which turns out to be literally true (!). Having their Scripture, humans can safely eschew mystical experience which is something that the ""Cylons"" have a mono-poly on. Let us also not forget that the plot is based on 12 human colonies trying to find Earth (ie, ""Zion"")!On the other hand, intellectuals and scientists are demonized (cowardly, crazy and traitorous), as are unions and civil society advocates (power-hungry ex-terrorists) and any mental-emotional sophistication (likely to be manipulation by Cylon enemies). In other words, the show could have been (and perhaps was) written by a Dobson-Cheney surrogate in some military Psy Ops room or another. if so, the creators should get medals for it.Because the show works. The drama and its protagonists suck me right in every single time. Great writing, directing, excellent acting, great selection of actors which, surprisingly for a 'fundamentalist' show, feature women in key combat roles. That was an excellent call; the Lt. Starbuck character in particular mixes macho posturing and femaleness in a weirdly unique and unflinchingly consistent way. So one roots for Galactica and her crew and is happy and relieved every time they blast their way through Cylon lines.the director certainly does not spare viewers' sensibilities. The language is raunchy (what the frack!), violence is depicted graphically with no details spared, the creators of the show revel in all kinds of abuse and torture; the graphic nature of confrontations at physical, psychological and cultural levels is imo quite effective. BSG and its cousin Stargate represent polar opposites to the philosophical sophistication and enlightening aspirations of shows such as Star Trek or early Star Wars; they're the Sci-Fi equivalent of redneck pulp that catalyzes people's inherent fear of the ""Other"" rather than teaching them to be better, more 'enlightened', humans.

945370,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B000BNI90Y,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members areremarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity andcontradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters tochange and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,even if they're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've everseen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad tofinish a great book.For me this was the series really seemed to start finding it's stride,it's deeper, darker, more complex focus.  To be clear. it'sgreat from the get-go, but the themes started getting morecomplex, heroes and villains more gray, and the series starteddemanding more from the viewer.Also, Amazon UK currently has a complete region free blu-ray boxset for about $100 with shipping.

945374,AP78Z2N34AM1R,B000BNI90Y,"Krylos ""S.Ray""","[3, 8]","This review adresses the entire series, as well as, season 2.  I give it 4 stars only because it's half a season.Still, I am glad that they will have the first half available in time for Christmas shopping (not so useful in June). It's nice to see some marketers getting it right for a change, giving us something we actually want when we want it (remember when you had to buy a whole CD to get your single favorite song...hellooo).I waded into the mini-series and even season one, quite skeptical. I promised myself I'd give it a chance. I loved the original despite it's frivolity and lack of continuity..I suppose I loved ""the potential"" it had.Well, here it is, they fixed it. Simple as that. And as mentioned in another review, though I can't say it is the Best Sci-Fi show ever, (that would arguably be B5), it is definitely living up to a large percentage of the potential this concept offers.Season two gets a bit formulaic and a tiny bit frivolous (SPOILER: Cylons can't be detected by doctors or DNA, but they can shove a data feed in their arm and talk to the computer?? Can't be nanobots, we can detect those now.). You start to feel some of the twists happen before they do, and that is a bit of a letdown, but there are still those edge of the seat moments too, just farther between.  At least there are more than 50,000 humans to experiment on now (I mean unless you consider that many more in the fleet are actually cylons).  I, for one, commend the writers for keeping these loose threads to the original series. Though the die-hards will probably have something demeaning to say about that too. I think it's awesome.Speaking of which,(SPOILER) who would have thought Lucy Lawless was a Cylon model? Um, guys, do you realize you revealed a cylon model that you might not be able to get back in a year or two. What's the point in having a throw away Cylon revelation? It's a twist yeah, but with only 15 or so potential actor roles out there, that gives about 3 seasons worth of surprises, then maybe they'll have to get polymer-plastic surgery??Anyway, Rock On new Galactica!",4,This not your father's Ponderosa in space,1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,2092,"['review', 'entire', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'season', '2', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'only', 'season.Still', 'am', 'glad', 'will', 'have', 'first', 'half', 'available', 'time', 'Christmas', 'shopping', 'not', 'so', 'useful', 'June', 'nice', 'see', 'marketers', 'getting', 'right', 'change', 'giving', 'something', 'actually', 'want', 'when', 'want', 'remember', 'when', 'had', 'buy', 'whole', 'CD', 'get', 'single', 'favorite', 'song', 'hellooo', '.I', 'waded', 'mini-series', 'even', 'season', 'one', 'quite', 'skeptical', 'promised', ""'d"", 'give', 'chance', 'loved', 'original', 'frivolity', 'lack', 'continuity..I', 'suppose', 'loved', 'potential', 'here', 'fixed', 'Simple', 'mentioned', 'review', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Best', 'Sci-Fi', 'show', 'ever', 'would', 'arguably', 'be', 'B5', 'definitely', 'living', 'up', 'large', 'percentage', 'potential', 'concept', 'offers.Season', 'two', 'bit', 'formulaic', 'tiny', 'bit', 'frivolous', 'SPOILER', 'Cylons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'detected', 'doctors', 'DNA', 'can', 'shove', 'data', 'feed', 'arm', 'talk', 'computer', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'nanobots', 'can', 'detect', 'now.', 'start', 'feel', 'twists', 'happen', 'do', 'bit', 'letdown', 'are', 'still', 'edge', 'seat', 'moments', 'too', 'just', 'farther', 'least', 'are', 'more', '50,000', 'humans', 'experiment', 'now', 'mean', 'consider', 'many', 'more', 'fleet', 'are', 'actually', 'cylons', 'one', 'commend', 'writers', 'keeping', 'loose', 'threads', 'original', 'series', 'die-hards', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'something', 'demeaning', 'say', 'too', 'think', 'awesome.Speaking', 'SPOILER', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'was', 'Cylon', 'model', 'Um', 'guys', 'do', 'realize', 'revealed', 'cylon', 'model', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'year', 'two', 'What', 'point', 'having', 'throw', 'away', 'Cylon', 'revelation', 'twist', 'yeah', 'only', '15', 'so', 'potential', 'actor', 'there', '3', 'seasons', 'surprises', 'then', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'have', 'get', 'polymer-plastic', 'surgery', 'Anyway', 'Rock', 'new', 'Galactica']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

That hurts the show.Anyway, for those of you who don't have time to go through all these reviews I counted one, maybe two people who don't like it.  All other negative reviews are from people pissed at Universal for not releasing the full season together....and with good reason.  This is one of the most thought-provoking, well written, character-driven dramas ever.  There is no restart button, no heros, no villians.  This is just a story of people trying to get by, and accomplish their goals.  I've compared it many times to George RR Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series (Martin has recently declared himself to be a fan), because of the sheer humanness of everyone on their.  I don't mean sympathetic villians and flawed heros, I mean NO VILLIANS and NO HEROS.All I can say is, get this show, but be prepared for something complex.  You should sit down and watch it only when you can watch at least a full episode, uninterrupted, at a time, or you'll become confused.  The story arc is THAT strong.And as a last note to the whiners, look at some full season DVD box sets.  By that I mean those with 20+ episodes on them (ie Star Trek).  You'll notice that most of them cost at least $100.  This is 10 episodes for $40.  The makers are charging what it's worth, not ripping you off.

How in the world could I watch this show with commercials interrupting it?  That would drive me nuts!Without giving it away for anyone like me who is buying the DVD sets to catch-up, I'll say that what I love about this half-season in particular is as follows:First, flawed beaten up humans keep their dignity and morality.  Many of the episodes are morality plays without being preachy or predictible.Second, I really can't predict where the story is going.  You think it's going one way, and then it goes the other.  And, the story really starts to move fast toward the end.  Where are they going with this?  Well, I'll have to wait for the next set of DVDs.Third, keeping the Pegasus around a while was a great idea.  It made for some interesting stories that would not have been possible otherwise.Fourth, I don't remember any painful-to-watch scenes of Dr. Boltar having auto-erotic experiences with the Number Six in his head.  I really hated that in the early episodes.  I'm glad that got toned down.Fifth, we've got many characters being developed at once.

945378,A6F97U4CSFDAP,B000BNI90Y,litemakr,"[63, 91]","I had to put my 2 cents in after reading all of the over the top praise for the second half of season 4. Not sure what show these people were watching, but at least half of these episodes were pure filler and build up to a big conclusion that, frankly, did not happen. The ""answers"" to some of the big plot points were lazy and uninspired. The writers obviously had no clue how to live up to the questions they had introduced, so they mostly just flat out ignored them.SPOILERS AHEAD. I am okay with some ambiguity about things like the inconsistently used in-heads, but after the huge mysterious build up over more than a season about Kara, what they did was inexcusable and LAZY. She just disappears?? Ridiculous. They didn't know how to get out of the corner they had written her into. So she just vanished and it was up to us to ""interpret""? That is total, lazy BS. They should have left her dead and had her be an in head. But they obviously did not think it through and had no plan when they brought her back. Her character was completely shortchanged, as was the audience. If they couldn't tell us what she was, at least they could have told us WHY she came back. And what was up with the brand new ship? Or her drawings as a child? Or the music (All Along the Watchtower is a divine song floating around the galaxy 150,000 years before it was written??) If you look back on her actions over season 4, they don't add up or make sense. If she was a divine being or sent by one, they sure didn't give her much of a purpose. Except for a dead end dramatic cheat.And the fates of the main characters? Scattered around the planet, mostly alone? Adama abandons his son and friends to live alone? Absurd! The ENTIRE fleet UNANIMOUSLY decided to give up technology, send the fleet into the sun and live like nomads? Are you kidding me? Just stupid. The cylons? What happened to them? Cavill agress to a truce (suddenly) then even more suddenly freaks out, then shoots himself. Stupid. Just stupid. The final five? Once revealed, they did nothing. We got to see Ellen act soap opera jealous for a full episode. What a waste of screen time. The opera house vision? The prophecies? All that time spent building them up, with no payoff at all. And the hit you over the head flash to modern times with the in heads contemplating  ""all this has happened before and will happen again"" (which btw, Ron Moore got from watching Disney's Peter Pan and decided to steal for BSG, with no idea how he would use it. He stole the ""you are the harbinger of death"" line from Planet of the Apes for crying out loud! And the BSG theme of cylons rebelling against humans in a cycle is a lot like apes rebelling against humans in a cycle). Lame, lame, lame. Just awful.The only satisfactory ending was for Roslin, and that is mostly because of good acting from her and Olmos and the fact that she had to die, so we knew what to expect and the writers didn't have to try to be creative.I think once even hard core fans come down from the end of the show, they will re-evaluate the end of the series and be very disappointed. It was bad, sloppy writing, and kind of a middle finger to the devoted fans. The series had some really great moments, but also a lot of trite filler and misdirection. I had hoped things would pull together beautifully. But they didn't, not by a longshot.This would have bee a 3 star review, but it is reduced to two stars because of the greed at releasing 2 sets for the season, and not at a reduced price. $100 MSRP to get 20 good to mediocre to terrible episodes?

Let's say: they search for their hoome planet only to find it barren and then finally manage to find finally another one which is the real Earth. here the whole thing slightly unravels and one would have wanted a stronger ending. Also the fact that there are many ""movements"" among the Cylons, some of which are siding with the humans, even Cennturions, really stretches the imagination beyond what is possible.

Then while on vacation, I wasn't interested in watching the TV shows in my room and watched this show on my computer.  I fell in love with it.  The second season 2.5 deals mainly with Sharon, a pilot who has dreams and lapses of memory which causes her to think she is a cylon.

945383,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B000BNI90Y,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I can hardly find words to state my admiration for the new Battlestar Galactica as a whole - and it is even harder for me to correctly describe the ending, which I loved and hated in the same time. But even if I absolutely HATED one (and only one) thing in the last episode, as a whole I rate this final season five stars without a moment of hesitation.If you watched the previous seasons, you will probably understand how addictive and irresistible those series were. I swallowed all the seasons as if I was an alcoholic and if they were old scotch - gulping, slurping, crying and moaning, forgetting anything and everything else. If you did not watch the previous seasons, do it immediately! As a whole the new Battlestar Galactica is an incredible show, operating at a level much above the usual TV series - in my modest opinion, only two other shows, ""The Shield"" and ""The Wire"", reached the same level of perfection.There are many sad and heartbreaking moments in those series - I do not want to provide too much spoilers, but twice I almost cried. Death and suffering are everywhere and the story becomes even darker and more desperate that in the beginning miniseries. It would seem that it is very hard to do something darker and more desperate than a nuclear war and extermination of humanity - well, as you will see, it can be done. Some much beloved characters will not make it until the final credits.In those final episodes three are even more outstanding, reaching a quality that I simply can not describe with words. Two of them, ""Oath"" and ""Blood on the scales"", describe a short but extremely vicious and bloody civil war erupting in the human fleet. They are absolutely exceptional and I will not say anything more about them - you deserve to discover them yourself.And then arrives the very last episode, ""Daybreak, part 2"", which is twice as long than usual. I believe that the first 40 minutes of it are possibly the best TV science fiction I have ever seen and in fact I consider them as good as ""Star Wars"" (and this is a HUGE compliment coming from me). The only thing I will say here is that most of those 40 minutes are a battle... and WHAT a battle it is!Then comes the part I hated with my whole heart because it was SO INCREDIBLY STUPID and politically correct that I could hardly believe my eyes! If you really need to know what I am talking about, there is enough spoilers in other reviews here (especially the ones giving one star). I will just say that the final decision of humans and Cylons of the fleet defies reason and logic and guarantees to them and their descendants an endless supply of back breaking labor, inescapable misery, heartbreaking suffering and return to the most obscure savagery - provided that they survive at all (and in my modest opinion they would not).Many reviewers strongly objected to the Christian messages in those last episodes of Battlestar Galactica and it is clear that they are very strongly present. Being a Christian I rather appreciated it - but for atheists this final season can be indeed very upsetting.All in all, I loved the whole series and I loved the final season as much as the rest - even if there was ONE politically correct, New Age inspired and galactically stupid black spot, which made me howl with anger and disgust in the last 30 minutes of the last episode. But then, the VERY final punch line in the last seconds of the last episode made me immediately forget that bad moment...I recommend those series and this final season with my whole heart - I spend wonderful moments watching the new Battlestar Galactica and I think you will too.",5,"Unexpected, shocking and EXTREMELY controversial conclusion of INCREDIBLE series!",1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,3628,"['can', 'hardly', 'find', 'words', 'state', 'admiration', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'whole', 'even', 'harder', 'correctly', 'describe', 'ending', 'loved', 'hated', 'same', 'time', 'even', 'absolutely', 'HATED', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'last', 'episode', 'whole', 'rate', 'final', 'season', 'five', 'stars', 'moment', 'hesitation.If', 'watched', 'previous', 'seasons', 'will', 'probably', 'understand', 'how', 'addictive', 'irresistible', 'series', 'were', 'swallowed', 'seasons', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'were', 'old', 'scotch', 'gulping', 'slurping', 'crying', 'moaning', 'forgetting', 'anything', 'everything', 'else', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'previous', 'seasons', 'do', 'immediately', 'whole', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'incredible', 'show', 'operating', 'level', 'much', 'usual', 'TV', 'series', 'modest', 'opinion', 'only', 'two', 'other', 'shows', 'Shield', 'Wire', 'reached', 'same', 'level', 'perfection.There', 'are', 'many', 'sad', 'heartbreaking', 'moments', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'provide', 'too', 'much', 'spoilers', 'twice', 'almost', 'cried', 'Death', 'suffering', 'are', 'everywhere', 'story', 'even', 'darker', 'more', 'desperate', 'beginning', 'miniseries', 'would', 'seem', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'something', 'darker', 'more', 'desperate', 'nuclear', 'war', 'extermination', 'humanity', 'well', 'will', 'see', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'much', 'beloved', 'characters', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'final', 'credits.In', 'final', 'episodes', 'three', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'outstanding', 'reaching', 'quality', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'describe', 'words', 'Two', 'Oath', 'Blood', 'scales', 'describe', 'short', 'extremely', 'vicious', 'bloody', 'civil', 'war', 'erupting', 'human', 'fleet', 'are', 'absolutely', 'exceptional', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'deserve', 'discover', 'then', 'very', 'last', 'episode', 'Daybreak', 'part', '2', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'usual', 'believe', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'are', 'possibly', 'best', 'TV', 'science', 'fiction', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'fact', 'consider', 'as', 'good', 'Star', 'Wars', 'HUGE', 'compliment', 'coming', 'only', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'here', 'most', '40', 'minutes', 'are', 'battle', 'WHAT', 'battle', 'Then', 'part', 'hated', 'whole', 'heart', 'was', 'SO', 'INCREDIBLY', 'STUPID', 'politically', 'correct', 'could', 'hardly', 'believe', 'eyes', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'enough', 'spoilers', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'especially', 'ones', 'giving', 'one', 'star', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'final', 'decision', 'humans', 'Cylons', 'fleet', 'defies', 'reason', 'logic', 'guarantees', 'descendants', 'endless', 'supply', 'back', 'breaking', 'labor', 'inescapable', 'misery', 'heartbreaking', 'suffering', 'return', 'most', 'obscure', 'savagery', 'provided', 'survive', 'modest', 'opinion', 'would', 'not', '.Many', 'reviewers', 'strongly', 'objected', 'Christian', 'messages', 'last', 'episodes', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'clear', 'are', 'very', 'strongly', 'present', 'Being', 'Christian', 'rather', 'appreciated', 'atheists', 'final', 'season', 'can', 'be', 'indeed', 'very', 'upsetting.All', 'loved', 'whole', 'series', 'loved', 'final', 'season', 'as', 'much', 'rest', 'even', 'was', 'ONE', 'politically', 'correct', 'New', 'Age', 'inspired', 'galactically', 'stupid', 'black', 'spot', 'made', 'howl', 'anger', 'disgust', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'last', 'episode', 'then', 'VERY', 'final', 'punch', 'line', 'last', 'seconds', 'last', 'episode', 'made', 'immediately', 'forget', 'bad', 'moment', 'recommend', 'series', 'final', 'season', 'whole', 'heart', 'spend', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'watching', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'think', 'will', 'too']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

Bummer.BSG in it's latest iteration carried those poor survivors a heck of a lot farther than the original series (there are still die-hard fans of the original series out there, who absolutely HATE this series, but theirs is a minority, I believe).For a series that had only three well-known actors surrounded by fresh new Canadian, Australian, English and American actors, The talent pool they were taken from is rich indeed, and it showed in their performances. I believe we will be seeing much more of these young people in the future. Of course, they wouldn't be as good without quality writing and directing, either. This series had it all! For once, the network heads decided to let BSG run WITHOUT too much network interference, which ALWAYS destroys the show in question.I have to give kudos to Edward J. Olmos, Mary McDonnell, Dean Stockwell and all those relative unknowns they acted beside, and the Writers and Directors, as well as the crew for bringing such a quality program to Network TV. Now, I may be just a little bit biased, but I have to say that BSG was (is?) the best show I have seen in the 55+ years I've been exposed to TV. The fact that we have a drama in space turns off some folk, but believe me when I say that I would rather watch a GREAT space drama than a crappy show on Earth that is predictable and boring, with performances on par with a 7th grade reading class!With all the extras and websites devoted to this series out there, including SciFi Channel, the storyline is now complete, but boy, was it ever difficult to predict what was going to happen next! In four years of predictions, I was right only ONCE, and that came at the end! Ron Moore and David Eick are the next wave in QUALITY storytelling. There seems to be TWO new series coming soon on SciFi Channel that are tie-ins to BSG. One is called ""Caprica"", and the other is ""Battlestar Galactica, The Plan"". I believe that these two new series will tie up most, if not all (hopefully)of the plot holes and apparent dead ends seen in the new BSG series. If Ron Moore and David Eick have a hand in them, I'll be watching!My hope is that ""Hollyweird"" finally gives breathing room for those forward thinking folk like Moore and Eick, and other Writers and Directors who are well past the ""status quo"" of Hollywood storytelling, which has grown old, fat, and not without the ubiquitous olfactory signal to let you know how bad what you're watching REALLY is!BSG broke the mold, so all you Hollyweird knuckleheads are on notice!",5,"ashes to ashes, dust to dust, with a warning for the future.",1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,2533,"['over', 'Bummer.BSG', 'latest', 'iteration', 'carried', 'poor', 'survivors', 'heck', 'lot', 'farther', 'original', 'series', 'are', 'still', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'original', 'series', 'there', 'who', 'absolutely', 'HATE', 'series', 'minority', 'believe', '.For', 'series', 'had', 'only', 'three', 'well-known', 'actors', 'surrounded', 'fresh', 'new', 'Canadian', 'Australian', 'English', 'American', 'actors', 'talent', 'pool', 'were', 'taken', 'rich', 'indeed', 'showed', 'performances', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'much', 'more', 'young', 'people', 'future', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'good', 'quality', 'writing', 'directing', 'either', 'series', 'had', 'once', 'network', 'heads', 'decided', 'let', 'BSG', 'run', 'WITHOUT', 'too', 'much', 'network', 'interference', 'ALWAYS', 'show', 'question.I', 'have', 'give', 'kudos', 'Edward', 'J.', 'Olmos', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'acted', 'beside', 'Writers', 'Directors', 'as', 'well', 'crew', 'bringing', 'quality', 'program', 'Network', 'TV', 'Now', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'biased', 'have', 'say', 'BSG', 'was', 'best', 'show', 'have', 'seen', '55+', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'exposed', 'TV', 'fact', 'have', 'drama', 'space', 'off', 'folk', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'GREAT', 'space', 'drama', 'crappy', 'show', 'Earth', 'predictable', 'boring', 'performances', 'par', '7th', 'grade', 'reading', 'class', 'extras', 'websites', 'devoted', 'series', 'there', 'including', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'storyline', 'now', 'complete', 'boy', 'was', 'ever', 'difficult', 'predict', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'predictions', 'was', 'right', 'only', 'ONCE', 'came', 'end', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'David', 'Eick', 'are', 'next', 'wave', 'QUALITY', 'storytelling', 'be', 'TWO', 'new', 'series', 'coming', 'soon', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'are', 'tie-ins', 'BSG', 'One', 'called', 'Caprica', 'other', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Plan', 'believe', 'two', 'new', 'series', 'will', 'tie', 'up', 'most', 'not', 'hopefully', 'plot', 'holes', 'apparent', 'dead', 'ends', 'seen', 'new', 'BSG', 'series', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'David', 'Eick', 'have', 'hand', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'hope', 'Hollyweird', 'finally', 'breathing', 'room', 'forward', 'thinking', 'folk', 'Moore', 'Eick', 'other', 'Writers', 'Directors', 'who', 'are', 'well', 'status', 'quo', 'Hollywood', 'storytelling', 'grown', 'old', 'fat', 'not', 'ubiquitous', 'olfactory', 'signal', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'bad', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'REALLY', 'BSG', 'broke', 'mold', 'all', 'Hollyweird', 'knuckleheads', 'are', 'notice']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

None of it will compel you.But if you've followed the series from season 1, you practically *must* see through the story line to season 2. And fortunately, most of season 2 lives up to the high quality of the first season.This set is only truly the first ""half"" of season 2 - season 2.5, while technically labeled and sold separately, is really the second half of season 2. This first half, fortunately, almost stands on its own, and aside from the final episode ""Pegasus,"" is not truly tied to the second half - thus, it is possible (if you bought season 1) to buy this season of BSG, and not continue further with the series. It may not fully end the story of the Battlestar Galactica and its crew, but it does leave it on at least a satisfactory note.Season 2 picks up right where 1 left off, and continues to track Galactica and its crew through an ongoing crisis (or three). Along the way we get greater insights into the history of the self-destructive Colonel Tigh, what makes Apollo tick and why he has that gigantic chip on his shoulder, and what can crack the tough facade of Starbuck - as well as some amazing glimpses of what that Cylon ""plan"" really might be.As I said, one could watch most of this season, stop around episode 7 or 9, and not watch further. Beware, however, that once you've decided to go ahead and continue with ""Pegasus,"" you will be nearly forced to continue the story through season 2.5. Don't let this stop you, however - that episode gives us new characters, new crises, and one of the absolute best performances by Callis and Helfer (but it is gut and maybe heart-wrenching - be prepared to be disturbed).

A lot of ""Battlestar Galactica"" fans have had negative things to say about Season 2.0, Volume 2. I agree with some of the criticism, but not all of it. The one real problem I have with this show is that most episodes are very predictable and many of the storylines just keep recycling themselves. Almost every episode in this season seems to revolve around Adama, Starbuck, or Apollo being in mortal peril...that gets kind of old after a while. However, in spite of that, this is still a great show. It's so FRACKIN' INTENSE! A lot of important things happened during this season involving Adama's clash with the commander of the Pegasus ship, President Roslin's terminal cancer diagnosis, Starbuck and Apollo's personal relationships and professional development, Gaius Baltar's rise to power, and the cylon's infiltration into what is left of the human race.I don't want to spoil the season for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but there are plenty of ""shock and awe"" moments to look forward to. Beloved characters will die, surprise relationships will form, and the season finale cliffhanger is unlike anything you've ever seen in the series before! NOTHING will prepare you for what happens during the last 15 minutes of the final episode!I can't wait until the new season debuts this fall, but until then, I'm looking forward to catching last season's episodes for the second time with this DVD set.",5,"A bit predictable in places, but still frackin' amazing!",1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,1450,"[""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'DVD', 'release', 'lot', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'fans', 'have', 'had', 'negative', 'things', 'say', 'Season', '2.0', 'Volume', '2', 'agree', 'criticism', 'not', 'one', 'real', 'problem', 'have', 'show', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'predictable', 'many', 'storylines', 'just', 'keep', 'recycling', 'episode', 'season', 'revolve', 'Adama', 'Starbuck', 'Apollo', 'being', 'mortal', 'peril', 'kind', 'old', 'while', 'However', 'spite', 'still', 'great', 'show', 'so', 'FRACKIN', 'INTENSE', 'lot', 'important', 'things', 'happened', 'season', 'involving', 'Adama', 'clash', 'commander', 'Pegasus', 'ship', 'President', 'Roslin', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'Starbuck', 'Apollo', 'personal', 'relationships', 'professional', 'development', 'Gaius', 'Baltar', 'rise', 'power', 'cylon', 'infiltration', 'what', 'left', 'human', 'race.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'season', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'are', 'plenty', 'shock', 'awe', 'moments', 'look', 'forward', 'Beloved', 'characters', 'will', 'die', 'surprise', 'relationships', 'will', 'form', 'season', 'finale', 'cliffhanger', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'series', 'NOTHING', 'will', 'prepare', 'what', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'final', 'episode', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'new', 'season', 'fall', 'then', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'catching', 'last', 'season', 'episodes', 'second', 'time', 'DVD', 'set']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

The characters of Starbuck, Sharon and Helo are especially impressive - they, and the actors who play them, shade good into evil into good and sympathy into condemnation back into sympathy.But I'd like to write about the amazing and slightly subversive politics of BSG!  The now anachronistic 70's disco version of BSG was supposedly a version of the Mormon myth -- planets populated by humans who spread out over the galaxy.  The 21st century version of BSG is equally subversive - we are actually rooting for the conservative candidate Laura Roslin, pro-life, born again believer (in the Greek Gods) and a kick-a#* militarist to boot!  The fact that the writers of the series pull this off in such a subtle fashion is extraordinary... think about it...

945397,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B000BNI90Y,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[15, 16]","When the Sci-Fi Channel first announced back in 2003 that it was producing a miniseries version of the original 1978 TV series ""Battlestar Galactica"", I had a lot of doubts about how successful it would be because two of the former main characters were being turned from men into women and because the some of the Cylons were going to appear human.  When I first watched the miniseries back in 2003, my doubts were quickly washed away as the miniseries proved to be compelling, engaging, extremely realistic, emotional, well-acted and had superb special effects.  Due to the huge success of the miniseries, the Sci-Fi Channel decided to produce a TV series based upon its 2003 miniseries.  The first season of the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" TV series aired in 2004 and showed itself to be just as exciting and well made as the miniseries.  The second season of ""Battlestar Galactica"" that aired in 2005 was even more exciting and emotionally intense than the first.The primary characters in the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" are Commander William ""Husker"" Adama (Edward James Olmos), President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace (Katee Sackhoff), Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama (Jamie Bamber), Doctor Gaius Baltar (James Callis), Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii (Grace Park), the Cylon known as Number Six (Tricia Helfer), Col. Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) and Lt. Karl 'Helo' Agathon (Tahmoh Penikett).  Other characters include Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch, who played Apollo in the original 1978 ""Battlestar Galactica"" TV series), Chief Petty Officer Tyrol (Aaron Douglas), Crashdown (Sam Witwer) and Crewman Specialist Cally (Nicki Clyne).The 10 episodes of the second season are as follows:1. ""Scattered"". With Adama critically injured from the first season finale, Roslin imprisoned and people trapped on Kobol, the inept Col. Tigh takes command of the fleet, but only to lose the fleet when he orders the fleet to jump and the wrong jump coordinates are sent to the civilian fleet. In the meantime, Boomer, whose Cylon identity is well-known, sits in a jail cell on board Galactica while Starbuck becomes trapped on Caprica with Helo after the other Boomer takes her modified Cylon fighter.2. ""Valley of Darkness"".  A deadly Cylon virus is trying to take over Galactica's computers.  In the meantime, Baltar, Tyrol & the other people on Kobol fight for survival while Starbuck & Helo break into her old apartment on Caprica.3. ""Fragged"". The survivors on Kobol discover the Cylons are building an danti-aircraft gun while Adama is undergoing dangerous surgery. Not happy with the Quorum of Twelve, Col. Tigh places the fleet under martial law.4. ""Resistance"".  Galactica personnel open fire on a group of civilians protesting martial law.  Chief is accused of being a Cylon and arrested while Apollo helps Pres. Roslyn to escape confinement on Galactica.  Starback & Helo on Caprica find 53 surviving humans.5. ""The Farm"".  While the recovering Adama retakes command of the fleet from Col. Tigh, Pres. Roslyn leads a third of the fleet back to Kobol with the promise of finding the way to Earth.  On Caprica, a wounded Starbuck is taken to a strange hospital and makes an unpleasant discovery.6. ""Home: Part 1"". While Pres. Roslyn has a difficult time leading the civilian ships at Kobol, Starbuck, Helo and Boomer return from Caprica and arrive at Kobol to search for the Tomb of Athena.7. ""Home: Part 2"". Adama decides to return to Kobol to reunite the fleet and heads to the surface to join Pres. Roslyn and those with her in search of the Tomb of Athena.8. ""Final Cut"". A reporter, D'Anna Biers (Lucy Lawless), is given a large amount of access to report activities on Galactica.9. ""Flight of the Phoenix"". While the crew helps Chief to build a brand new fighter named ""The Black Bird"", Adama must put his trust in Boomer to stop a deadly Cylon computer virus that has been infecting Galactica's computers.10. ""Pegasus"".  The Galactica isn't the only surviving battlestar; the Pegasus also survived under the command of Admiral Helena Cain (Michelle Forbes), who takes command of the civilian fleet and begins to make things so difficult for Adama that a very real fight is a distinct possibility.  What a season cliffhanger!Overall, I rate the second season of the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone.",5,"A Powerful Second Season for

Herzog,"[0, 0]","With all the shows that tend to last well beyond their creative peak, I think it was refreshing that a show chose to end a mere four seasons into its run.  The trouble with ending so early, is everyone is expecting a conclusion that perfectly wraps up eveything.  So, when you're in the last ten episodes of 4.5, every episode is expected to provide more clarity and conclude the mysteries we've all wanted solved for so long.  Sadly this did not happen.  Certain mysteries were resolved, while other were not.  This led to a strong divide amongst the fans as to the merits of the last ten episodes.  The reality is, if they are judged on their own, and not merely as a conclusion, it is still very strong.  The mutiny story worked very well, as did the very very dark reactions to finding ""earth.""  Sadly, there were a few episodes toward the end where nothing happened, either being answered or in terms of story.  Ordinarly this would be just the same old BSG, but the audience wanted a conclusion.

945399,ATECU14VUIOJ0,B000BNI90Y,Miss Barbara,"[1, 4]","Note: SpoilersBSG ended the way it had to end.  The travelers become our seeds.  The angst of the journey is secondary to the planting.  The personal stories were interesting but inconsequential to the big picture - the getting to Earth and being the trigger of intelligence.  Many religious philosophies were introduced and explored with no real answers.  God?  Gods?  A cosmic dice game?  Social issues hinging on personal diversity shaded each season but the end game just scattered the travelers to distant continents continuing the isolation of tribes.  The migratory tracing of the mitochondrial DNA of Eve that many of us have been following via the National Geographic Genome Project counters the premise set forth in the final episode.  But then, this is fiction. Sometimes while watching the series I forget.  That's how good BSG is as a whole.Season 4 was a half season too long.  The producers and writers had to get from a strong Season 3 to the end and there was just not enough story line so too many hours were filled with battles and shoot'm ups.  There was too much back story in bars that added nothing to the overall account.  There was too much fluid running from Adama's mouth - did he have to brush his teeth twice in one episode and we won't mention the alley scene - it added nothing.Brevity would have helped this final season but all in all it was a great series that all others should strive to emulate.  I admire the actors, the writing, the cinematography and the music will never be equaled.  Even the worst season of BSG (which 4.5 is) is better than most of what we see on the tube.

The mini-series was even included which really boosted the value. However I'm not sure exactly how much of a good value this is. If you do the math you end up paying seventy dollars for the full set. This is a pretty good idea for sci-fi fans who are looking for good Christmas presents but I wish they'd cut the price on it. You can get a full season of Stargate SG-1 for the same price.Don't get me wrong season two has been great so far. I was really excited to see how the mutiny on Galactica and the shooting of Adama would work out and so far it hasn't let me down. Pegasus was a great episode that should be nominated for an Emmy and the show itself is getting so pretty good critcal response. I can't wait to see what else is in the future for the survivors of Kobol. As far as this set goes you pretty much have to make up your own mind because some people will set it as a rip-off.

My wife and I slammed through every episode in the course of a couple of weeks.  She's not usually a fan of science fiction, and I tend not to like science fiction television, but I had too many people tell me it was worth a look so we took the plunge and it was a lot of fun.In spite of a few hokey elements (ordinary telephones in space, Capricans eating sushi, etc.) the entire series kept me involved and excited.  It has drama, intrigue, excitement, thought-provoking ideas.  Everything you could want from science fiction.  Of course, if you're reading this review you're probably already hooked and don't need to be told all that.  Still, I think that some of the best moments of the series are in these final episodes. Most all of the questions about cylons and humans that really needed answering are answered, but in ways that put an intriguing spin on what we knew.

Don't read it if you have not watched the final season.IT ALSO CONTAINS CYNICISM BORN OF CRUSHED EXPECTATIONS. If you don't like cynicism in general, take a pass.IF YOU DON'T LIKE READING REVIEWS FROM PEOPLE YOU DISAGREE WITH (assuming you loved the ending) skip it entirely.TO ALL OTHERS: READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.TO THOSE WHO AGREE THAT THE SHOW ENDED IN DISASTER: my heart goes out to you. It really does.Remember the first season of Battlestar? When the Cylons were truly menacing? Inhuman enough to snap a baby's neck, resolved enough to nuke countless worlds into oblivion, and coldly calculating enough to track the Galactica across vast swathes of space, showing up with robotic precision exactly every 33 minutes? Remember how compellingly frightening they were, an antagonist that was easy to hate, to fear, to even dread? I remember watching that first season and being immeasurably impressed with the quality of the show, with the compelling characters, with the sci-fi elements, with everything that was Other about the Cylons, and the promise of a show that entered the spiritual and hard science fiction realms with deft ease. I remember the promise of the show: the potential to be THE BEST science fiction tv show ever created.4 years later, is that what those who fell in love with the show received? Did the promise of Battlestar come to fruition? Tragically the answer is no. Not just no but NOT EVEN CLOSE.Over a few seasons the show progressed away from excellence and originality and toward a banality and insignificance epitomized by the conclusion--if you can call it that since many things were never properly concluded. Cylons became humans, humans became Cylons, and all that made them distinct and interesting as parallels of one another or opposite sides of a spectrum, or beautifully constructed antagonists was lost in the process. I'm reminded of a story of the worst trade in baseball history in which a minor league team traded all of its players to another team for all of their players. The other team was their arch rivals, and it left all of their fans unsure if they should be cheering for the players that they had come to love, or for their team which was now comprised of players they had loved to hate...Essentially this is what Batlestar delivered, a blurring of the lines to the point of causing this viewer to ask, ""who cares?"" Honestly, who cares if the humans/Cylons/humans/hybrids survive? Haven't they all just become the same thing anyway? Who cares about Cavel and his petty obsessional sadism? Who cares about Adama and all his rage over Saul or Kara, or anyone else for that matter? There is nothing left to care about except individual characters 'tempest in a tea cup' emotional outbursts and petty infighting. The show lost its way in Season III and never recovered--you can only care about your protagonists in the light of their antagonists, and when those two things stop being distinct, the wheels fall off. This is a concept known to storytellers of all generations, and it amazes this viewer that the writers could get this so painfully, ineptly wrong.And to add insult to injury, all that was built into most of the characters that we DID care deeply about, all that made Kara Thrace who she is and was, all the questions about what it meant that she returned, that she came back from the dead, the implications of that were all swept away in probably the single most unfulfilling moment in the show. Why did she paint the future as a child and as an adult? Why did she return from death? How does she find the real location of earth using a song that her father taught her and that Anders is able to help decode? What does it all mean? We never get to know because... Kara vanishes. Poof. End of line.The fleet finds Earth, and what do they decide to do? Destroy all their ships and technology? Please. I hope they all realized they now get to be subsistence dirt farmers without the aid of modern tools (or even ancient tools since I doubt that useful things like animal husbandry, crop cultivation and specialization, basic meteorology, navigation, and a whole host of other essentials to even ancient civilizations are skill sets of a space faring race that has just spent a few years scurrying across the galaxy). I hope the massive number of thugs that resided on some of the ships were all good boys and girls and turned in their fire arms or we all know how this will end. Honestly the idea that you can get 30,000+ people to 100% to agree on ANYTHING is just stupid and especially something that catastrophically life changing. Did anyone bother to keep a still or two, because it not there are going to be some VERY unhappy residents. Like Saul. Or his godawful wife.The 30,000+ survivors of humanity's near total destruction also decide that separating into small groups and each taking a continent is a good plan? I guess being isolated from larger society in the confines of a ship convinced them that what they really wanted once the war was over was to stay separated? Adama so much so that he decides to live the life of a hermit, ignoring the first chance he's had to spend quality time with his son Lee?Is this really what these guys were fighting so hard to survive for? Giving up all they knew and spending several hundred thousand years living lives that Hobbes might describe as ""nasty, brutish, and short""? All their culture, society, inventions, science, history, all swept away in a reactionary decision that was never even explained in the show? The engineers and scientist and teachers and historians and even the priests/priestesses told to drop everything and pursue survival (a full time job absent any real technology)?New Earth turns out to be our Earth. We get a preachy message about robots and climate change. We learn that Hera is the mitochondrial mother of all the humans (in fact hybrids) that presently live on Earth. She was so important, so essential, so... disappointing? Does this cheap cop-out please anyone? Because if it does, I want to hear what your theories were when you were watching the show for the first time. Why was Hera so important? What about the prophecies about her, the shared vision of Kara, The President, Athena, etc... Were any of your theories that she would prove to be the mitochondrial mother of all humanity? I would be willing to bet that ANY of the things you thought up would have been a better resolution that what we were offered. Because it JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE. We were led to believe over 4 seasons that she was ESSENTIAL and VERY IMPORTANT and in-fact a lynch-pin around which anchored the show. Instead she became a silly foot note strapped on as the show breathed its last shuddering breaths and collapsed in on itself.BSG is over. All our time and energy spent watching it, talking about it, thinking about it.We feel, what exactly? Elated at the brilliance of the answers to the show's myriad questions? Fired up because against all odds the fleet made it to Earth? Introspective as we consider the profoundness of show's deeper subtexts?Or are we wishing for that gun Cavel used to off himself so we can end the painful headache we've developed from asking the same question over and over and over again?Why.

945410,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B000BNI90Y,Newton Ooi,"[3, 4]","One of the trends pioneered by America is the sanctifying of TV shows as national events.  First were the major sporting events such as the World Series games.  Then we had politics, such as the McCarthy hearings & the Nixon - Kennedy presidential debates.  This was soon followed by televised concerts; who can forget the Beatles first live performance in the US on national TV.  Finally, we get around to made for TV shows.  The groundbreaker here was I Love Lucy, with some of the more famous episodes being major milestones in TV history.  In the past 10 years, many cable/satellite shows have become major events also, with one of the biggest ones being the SciFi channel's incarnation of Battlestar Galactica.  Fans of the original show waited 3 decades for something like this, but got a lot more than expected.  Battlestar Galactica became one of the best TV serials of all time, and probably the best ever in the science fiction genre; handily beating out all the Star Trek incarnations, all the WB network creations, and probably besting Firefly.  Hence nothing was so awaited as the series finale.  All the themes were tied together, all the plot lines were finished.  Yes the humans reach earth, yes the battle with the cyclons is resolved, all mixed in with major characters being killed off along the way; something the original show never had the chutzpah to do.  And of course we have great battle scenes, both in space and hand-to-hand combat.  All told, a great series.  And as any good DVD set does, this set offers extended and deleted scenes that are worth watching.",5,Journey's End,1271289600,"04 15, 2010",2010,1587,"['One', 'trends', 'pioneered', 'America', 'sanctifying', 'TV', 'shows', 'national', 'events', 'First', 'were', 'major', 'sporting', 'events', 'such', 'World', 'Series', 'games', 'Then', 'had', 'politics', 'such', 'McCarthy', 'hearings', 'Nixon', 'Kennedy', 'presidential', 'debates', 'was', 'soon', 'followed', 'televised', 'concerts', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'Beatles', 'first', 'live', 'performance', 'US', 'national', 'TV', 'Finally', 'get', 'made', 'TV', 'shows', 'groundbreaker', 'here', 'was', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'more', 'famous', 'episodes', 'being', 'major', 'milestones', 'TV', 'history', 'past', '10', 'years', 'many', 'cable/satellite', 'shows', 'have', 'become', 'major', 'events', 'also', 'one', 'biggest', 'ones', 'being', 'SciFi', 'channel', 'incarnation', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Fans', 'original', 'show', 'waited', '3', 'decades', 'something', 'got', 'lot', 'more', 'expected', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'became', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'serials', 'time', 'probably', 'best', 'ever', 'science', 'fiction', 'genre', 'handily', 'beating', 'out', 'Star', 'Trek', 'incarnations', 'WB', 'network', 'creations', 'probably', 'besting', 'Firefly', 'Hence', 'nothing', 'was', 'so', 'awaited', 'series', 'finale', 'themes', 'were', 'tied', 'together', 'plot', 'lines', 'were', 'finished', 'Yes', 'humans', 'reach', 'earth', 'yes', 'battle', 'cyclons', 'resolved', 'mixed', 'major', 'characters', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'way', 'something', 'original', 'show', 'never', 'had', 'chutzpah', 'do', 'course', 'have', 'great', 'battle', 'scenes', 'space', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'told', 'great', 'series', 'good', 'DVD', 'set', 'set', 'extended', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'worth', 'watching']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

Sci-Fi programmed a 3-month hiatus into the schedule so the final 10 episodes will be aired beginning 1/6/06.  If you just have to have this as an Xmas gift this year by all means do so; you'll enjoy the midseason cliffhanger as much as the rest of us PLUS you'll only have to wait a couple of weeks to see it resolved.  It'll probably be cheaper to wait for a complete Season 2 volume to come out, however and there may be added bonus features.""Season 2.0"" is a bit of misnomer even discounting it's only the first 10 episodes of Season 2.  Sci-Fi didn't pay for a full Season 1 so some of the plot threads from that aren't tied up until Season 2 Episode 5.  In effect what you have are the final 5 episodes of Season 1 plus just *5* episodes of Season 2. However it all works out in some bizarre non-Euclidean fashion.  The episodes pretty much stand on their own merit and you don't need a reference card to keep track of what's going on.  Season 2 is darker, richer, and more plot-driven than Season 1 and the Cylons still have some tricks up their sleeves to show us.  The mid-season cliffhanger is logical, satisfying, and the end and leaves you breathless waiting for the resolution in January.The good news is that Sci-Fi has already ordered a third season based on the response to the first two and it's likely the series will continue at least 8 seasons before they wind things up. The Colonials now know where Earth is but it's a *long* way off and the Cylons are hot on their heels.  Boomer's child is a key plot element and will have a significant impact on the storyline at some point.

945414,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000BNI90Y,OverTheMoon,"[3, 3]","(Get both Season 2 boxes if you are in for this.)The makers of Battlestar Galactica (BSG), who proved they had a big enough brass pair to offer up a challenge to Star Wars and Star Trek, have blasted this series up there with the best of the best. It is fraking mind-blowing television and some of the best SF since Luke Skywalker trusted the force and Spock tried to fix a damaged warp core.BSG is barely recognizable from the 1970s original series. Such is the scope of the makeover and development of the original storyline that all previous BSG series history has been declared void by the writers and the story has gone through a creative renewal. This reimagining was done to enhance the concept... and the reboot has paid off in aces.The Cylons were created by man. They evolved. There are many copies. And they have a plan. In the past, there was a war. The Cylons left. Now they are back and they want revenge. They chase and try to kill humans of the twelve colonies across the galaxy.BSG season 2 continues with the search for the Spear of Athena in the hope that it will point the way back to Earth. The religious elements become central to the story, especially the Cylon resurrection system, which becomes a target for a visually knocking out battle sequence. There are even crossover renegade groups starting to form in each camp. The new arrival of an important addition to the fleet and some of the most thrilling sequences yet seen for a show of any kind. BSG has also adopted more adult themes and has moved away from family viewing to allow for harder action sequences and higher intensity crises.Season 2 takes place mainly on the deck of the Galatica, but also on Colonial One (the President's cruise ship), the planets Caprica, Kobal and New Caprica. There is lots of powerhouse acting. Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) maintains his position as one of the most memorable characters in television history (you can rank him up there with the likes of Captain Picard). Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) as the President goes through some radical character dilemmas as does Starbuck, a woman in this version of BSG, whose background love relationships are as important as her action-woman persona. Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama (Jamie Bamber) ascends up the ranks and Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis) finds himself in an impasse between himself and the Cylons. Number Six (Tricia Helfer) starts a type of revolution. Colonel Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) relationship with his wife has an impact on his career. Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii (Grace Park) is a powerful Cylon presence that makes an impact on the storyline. Can the Cylons co-exist with humans? ... Can they hybridize? This is but a small section of the interesting storylines and enormous cast that BSG has to offer... and yes important characters do die, so its edge of your seat stuff through and through.The CGI is up there the best ILM can put out. One sequence in which an ejected pilot, Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama, observes the resurrection ship battle in the stars maybe one of the greatest SF action sequences of all time that would even make Kubrik's eyes go wide open. The real stars of the show are the screenwriters. It is their boat and they are taking us on what appears to be a voyage unparallel to anything else you have seen before.BSG Season 2 keeps up the post-9/11 brain candy. The writers sometimes jab at the Bush administration foreign and war policies and then again seem to back them up. In Season 1 it was about the constant search for fossil fuels and battling for control of resources while freedoms get restricted in the fight against terrorism, modelling our own political struggles. In Season 2 its politics coupled with colonization.The interesting religious confrontation involving polytheism (the human belief system in BSG) and monotheism (the Cylon belief system) has extended and even crosses over. The afterlife, or something like it, begins to emerge.Season 2 is mostly about finding Earth, the Cyclon resurrection ship, elections, hybridizing and colonization. If you are a fan of SF or just high-quality television, then nothing should be holding you back. BSG could very well be the most important SF TV since Star Trek. It certainly has propelled itself out of this world and is in a dimension all of its own... except when Cylons appear.",5,Buy Your Command - BSG Season 2 is one of the best television seasons of all time,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,4364,"['Get', 'Season', '2', 'boxes', 'are', 'makers', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'BSG', 'who', 'proved', 'had', 'big', 'enough', 'brass', 'pair', 'offer', 'up', 'challenge', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Star', 'Trek', 'have', 'blasted', 'series', 'there', 'best', 'best', 'fraking', 'mind-blowing', 'television', 'best', 'SF', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'trusted', 'force', 'Spock', 'tried', 'fix', 'damaged', 'warp', 'core.BSG', 'barely', 'recognizable', '1970s', 'original', 'series', 'Such', 'scope', 'makeover', 'development', 'original', 'storyline', 'previous', 'BSG', 'series', 'history', 'been', 'declared', 'void', 'writers', 'story', 'gone', 'creative', 'renewal', 'reimagining', 'was', 'done', 'enhance', 'concept', 'reboot', 'paid', 'off', 'aces.The', 'Cylons', 'were', 'created', 'man', 'evolved', 'are', 'many', 'copies', 'have', 'plan', 'past', 'was', 'war', 'Cylons', 'left', 'Now', 'are', 'back', 'want', 'revenge', 'chase', 'try', 'kill', 'humans', 'twelve', 'colonies', 'galaxy.BSG', 'season', '2', 'search', 'Spear', 'Athena', 'hope', 'will', 'point', 'way', 'back', 'Earth', 'religious', 'elements', 'become', 'central', 'story', 'especially', 'Cylon', 'resurrection', 'system', 'target', 'visually', 'knocking', 'out', 'battle', 'sequence', 'are', 'even', 'crossover', 'renegade', 'groups', 'starting', 'form', 'camp', 'new', 'arrival', 'important', 'addition', 'fleet', 'most', 'thrilling', 'sequences', 'yet', 'seen', 'show', 'kind', 'BSG', 'also', 'adopted', 'more', 'adult', 'themes', 'moved', 'away', 'family', 'viewing', 'allow', 'harder', 'action', 'sequences', 'higher', 'intensity', 'crises.Season', '2', 'place', 'mainly', 'deck', 'Galatica', 'also', 'Colonial', 'One', 'President', 'cruise', 'ship', 'planets', 'Caprica', 'Kobal', 'New', 'Caprica', 'lots', 'powerhouse', 'acting', 'Commander', 'William', 'Adama', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'position', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'television', 'history', 'can', 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'likes', 'Captain', 'Picard', 'Laura', 'Roslin', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'President', 'radical', 'character', 'dilemmas', 'Starbuck', 'woman', 'version', 'BSG', 'background', 'relationships', 'are', 'as', 'important', 'action-woman', 'persona', 'Captain', 'Lee', ""'Apollo"", 'Adama', 'Jamie', 'Bamber', 'up', 'ranks', 'Dr.', 'Gaius', 'Baltar', 'James', 'Callis', 'impasse', 'Cylons', 'Number', 'Six', 'Tricia', 'Helfer', 'type', 'revolution', 'Colonel', 'Saul', 'Tigh', 'Michael', 'Hogan', 'relationship', 'wife', 'impact', 'career', 'Lt.', 'Sharon', 'Valerii', 'Grace', 'Park', 'powerful', 'Cylon', 'presence', 'impact', 'storyline', 'Can', 'Cylons', 'co-exist', 'humans', 'Can', 'hybridize', 'small', 'section', 'interesting', 'storylines', 'enormous', 'cast', 'BSG', 'offer', 'yes', 'important', 'characters', 'do', 'die', 'edge', 'seat', 'stuff', 'through.The', 'CGI', 'there', 'best', 'ILM', 'can', 'put', 'out', 'One', 'sequence', 'ejected', 'pilot', 'Captain', 'Lee', ""'Apollo"", 'Adama', 'resurrection', 'ship', 'battle', 'stars', 'maybe', 'one', 'greatest', 'SF', 'action', 'sequences', 'time', 'would', 'even', 'make', 'Kubrik', 'eyes', 'go', 'wide', 'open', 'real', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'screenwriters', 'boat', 'are', 'taking', 'what', 'be', 'voyage', 'unparallel', 'anything', 'else', 'have', 'seen', 'before.BSG', 'Season', '2', 'post-9/11', 'brain', 'candy', 'writers', 'sometimes', 'jab', 'Bush', 'administration', 'foreign', 'war', 'policies', 'then', 'again', 'seem', 'back', 'up', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'constant', 'search', 'fossil', 'fuels', 'battling', 'control', 'resources', 'freedoms', 'get', 'restricted', 'fight', 'terrorism', 'modelling', 'own', 'political', 'struggles', 'Season', '2', 'politics', 'coupled', 'colonization.The', 'interesting', 'religious', 'confrontation', 'involving', 'polytheism', 'human', 'belief', 'system', 'BSG', 'monotheism', 'Cylon', 'belief', 'system', 'extended', 'even', 'crosses', 'afterlife', 'something', 'emerge.Season', '2', 'mostly', 'finding', 'Earth', 'Cyclon', 'resurrection', 'ship', 'elections', 'hybridizing', 'colonization', 'are', 'fan', 'SF', 'just', 'high-quality', 'television', 'then', 'nothing', 'should', 'be', 'holding', 'back', 'BSG', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'SF', 'TV', 'Star', 'Trek', 'certainly', 'propelled', 'world', 'dimension', 'own', 'when', 'Cylons', 'appear']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)
945415,A3VSMFDVHRGGS2,B000BNI90Y,Patrick J. Clark,"[12, 31]","Season 2 got a little dull towards the end--particularly the episodes involving ""Scar"" and the Billy brouhaha--and let's face it, the deus ex machina of Laura's miracle cure was lame.  Overall though, the appearance of Michelle Forbes made for a captivating storyline, as did Baltar's quest for the President's chair.  Overall, a fair season compared to season 1, which surpasses it easily, but gets steeped in building a new mythos and loses direction now and then.  Nonetheless the acting  and production is superb.Still, I can't believe how many reviewers have so far just accepted the split-up ""Season 2.0"" and ""Season 2.5"" marketing strategy for these DVDs.  Sure, the series is incredible, but there are plenty of excellent t.v. shows that don't pinch the consumer like this.  When will people learn that it's your acquiescence to buy this double-priced set that allows marketers to jack up prices.

Commander Adama tried to unseat President Roslin's government after a profound disagreement over the direction of the search for Earth; the Colonials score their first significant victory over the Cylons by destroying their basestar above the lost world of Kobol; and Sharon Valerii's true nature gets revealed to all as she tries to assassinate Commander Adama.With the ragtag fleet in disarray, Season 2 begins by trying to pick up the pieces.  It achieves this in fine fashion as it continues to explore the very nature of humanity as it struggles not only with act of survival, but also to concept of how they will survive.  The Raptor crew shipwrecked on Kobol strives to stay alive while Galactica figures out how to rescue them.  While on Kobol, the quest for more clues and signs about how to get to Earth are pursued.Another interest component of Season 2 is Starbuck's return to Caprica, to retrieve the Arrow of Apollo for President Roslin.  She comes into contact with Helo and the other Sharon, which stirs up tremendous conflict.  She also discovers that there is still a scrappy resistance movement fighting to make life hell for the Cylons.The second half of the season focuses on healing the wounds left behind by the military/government rift.  The development of the characters continues in fine fashion, especially with Grace Park coming into her own as Sharon now that her Cylon nature is known.In fine BSG fashion, the season ends with a big cliffhanger when Battlestar Pegasus (presumed to be destroyed during the original Cylon attack) appears and brief euphoria of finding more humans is quickly replaced by the terror of Admiral Cain's `win-at-all-costs' dictatorial leadership.With the exception of the discovery on Kobol, the forward moves are smaller in Season 2.  However, this is not a negative.  The plot continues to evolve organically and the end result is another satisfying run of BSG.",5,Another excellent season as humanity continues its struggle for survival,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,2019,"['Season', '1', 're-imagined', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'ended', 'bang', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'Commander', 'Adama', 'tried', 'unseat', 'President', 'Roslin', 'government', 'profound', 'disagreement', 'direction', 'search', 'Earth', 'Colonials', 'score', 'first', 'significant', 'victory', 'Cylons', 'destroying', 'basestar', 'lost', 'world', 'Kobol', 'Sharon', 'Valerii', 'true', 'nature', 'revealed', 'assassinate', 'Commander', 'Adama.With', 'ragtag', 'fleet', 'disarray', 'Season', '2', 'begins', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'fine', 'fashion', 'explore', 'very', 'nature', 'humanity', 'not', 'only', 'act', 'survival', 'also', 'concept', 'how', 'will', 'survive', 'Raptor', 'crew', 'shipwrecked', 'Kobol', 'stay', 'alive', 'Galactica', 'out', 'how', 'rescue', 'Kobol', 'quest', 'more', 'clues', 'signs', 'how', 'get', 'Earth', 'are', 'pursued.Another', 'interest', 'component', 'Season', '2', 'Starbuck', 'return', 'Caprica', 'retrieve', 'Arrow', 'Apollo', 'President', 'Roslin', 'contact', 'Helo', 'other', 'Sharon', 'up', 'tremendous', 'conflict', 'also', 'still', 'scrappy', 'resistance', 'movement', 'fighting', 'make', 'life', 'hell', 'Cylons.The', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'healing', 'wounds', 'left', 'military/government', 'rift', 'development', 'characters', 'fine', 'fashion', 'especially', 'Grace', 'Park', 'coming', 'own', 'Sharon', 'now', 'Cylon', 'nature', 'known.In', 'fine', 'BSG', 'fashion', 'season', 'big', 'cliffhanger', 'when', 'Battlestar', 'Pegasus', 'presumed', 'be', 'destroyed', 'original', 'Cylon', 'attack', 'brief', 'euphoria', 'finding', 'more', 'humans', 'quickly', 'replaced', 'terror', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'win-at-all-costs', 'dictatorial', 'exception', 'discovery', 'Kobol', 'forward', 'moves', 'are', 'smaller', 'Season', '2', 'However', 'not', 'negative', 'plot', 'evolve', 'organically', 'end', 'result', 'satisfying', 'run', 'BSG']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

My major complaints are that the show gets way too dark, to the point of being down right bleak. More humor is required to lighten things up a bit.Also the show exposes its political colors on several issues like abortion, euthanasia, etc. No matter what one believes a good show will show both sides how the world naturally manifests theses and not make one side seem cardboard like by using these issues to make its own political point. The show then moves away from entertainment and into the realm of propaganda. This show has so much potential and it was disheartening to see this element come out so strongly, at least in several of the episodes.Fortunately there were other episodes and elements to the show that had great worth, hence the still relatively high rating.

On the other hand, it wants to be a modern, relevant statement about war and humanity, or war and humanity as seen by Hollywood.This internal war took a turn for the worse towards the end.  There were still some good scenes, but overall I found that I wasn't enjoying the show anymore because literally every character had been undermined and there was nobody left that I really liked.Chief?  Beats his wife.  Turns out to be a cylon.  Grows cold hearted.Admiral?  Goes from stoic veteran to puking, suicidal crybaby.Dualla?  Well, you know.  What was THAT all about?Gaeta?  Yikes.  Can't undermine a character much more than that!Anders?  Sigh.Kara?  ?!?!I could go on.Point is, they destroyed, in one way or another, literally every character in the show.  Apparently ""keepin' it real, ya'll"" is more important than telling a good, compelling story with likable, strong characters.  Okay, fine, so humanity is on the ropes, doom and gloom, etc.  I'm not saying it should have been a cast of stoic, flag waving heroes but geez, you could have left us ONE.  How many breakdowns does Admiral Adama GET TO HAVE?And then there was still a lot of unexplained weirdness.  Stuff it seems like they forgot about, or ditched, or maybe they just fired the one writer who actually had a plan for all this stuff, I dunno.  Oh, and WHY ARE WE DOING CHARACTER DEVELOPING FLASHBACKS IN THE FINAL EPISODES?!  Whose idea was that?!  Seriously, just fast forward through all the flashbacks, because they're pure filler, explain nothing and actually serves to undermine the characters that much more.  (I hope someone eventually does a BSG spoof movie, in the spirit of Meet the Spartans or Scary Movie, and part of the spoof should be that every 15 minutes, Adama walks by in the background, crying, drinking, puking, throwing paint around and asking random people to shoot him.)I could go on, but honestly, I would have been okay with the way they ended the show had they not turned me into a disinterested party by undermining the characters.  I watched the end of this show out of a sense of investment, that I should see it through to the end, not because I was still interested in what was going on.

945422,A260X99UW6HA9Z,B000BNI90Y,Prauge Traveler,"[140, 157]","For those already familiar to the series: This set of DVDs offers some decent bonuses- you'll find that it includes an expanded version of the midseason cliff-hanger ""Resurrection Ship"" with some deleted scenes incorporated into the show.  I liked this a lot, because watching the deleted scenes seperately from the show/movie usually loses some of the impact of the scenes.  This alone makes the two part season purchase worthwhile in my opinion.  The other extra material is standard- commentary and making of features.In the second half of Battlestar Galactica's second season, you will enjoy the resolution to the arrival of the Pegasus in the climax of ""Resurrection Ship"".  The show also brings the resistance movement on Caprica into better focus, and makes the characters there more important to the overall story.  One aspect of season two that I am not completely sold on at this point is the expansion of the Cylon's internal structure, as expressed in the Cylon war-hero story.  I think I enjoyed the mystery and confusion behind their true motives.  It would be a shame for the arch-villains to become predictable and stale.For those already addicted to this show, 2.5 will satisfy you to a point, but I believe the finale will only be justified by where the show goes in season 3.  Right now I am a little skeptical, and will even go so far as saying it approaches the hokey sci-fi clich&eacute;s (granted, clich&eacute;s that we all like to watch) that the show has so assiduously avoided so far.  One thing the final episode will do is set up a whole new string of story possibilities in the coming season/seasons; it is such a crazy ender that I don't see how they can possibly resolve the issues in the first episode or even entire season 3.  Maybe that's what the whole idea ultimately is about: creating more story possibilities.  The final cliffhanger is not quite as emotional as the assassination at the end of season 1, but it will leave you wanting more.If you happen to be a new to this sci-fi phenomenon, I highly recommend you first watch season 1.  This series is not the typical sci-fi that is `plug and play' at any point in the series (ala most Trek series).  If you jump in midstream, you'll probably find yourself asking ""what the ____?"" and ""why do I care about this character?"".  This quality is one of the shows strong points, conflicts are not resolved every 50 minutes and tidily packaged so that the next episode will be back at square one.  Like real life the problems and troubles often follow the characters through their journey.  And I will add this - Battlestar Galactica manages to bridge the gap between `sci-fi' people and people who typically don't watch sci-fi.  I can say this with nearly complete certainty.  I am a sci-fi person in the military, and I have enjoyed spreading this show around- despite many initial and long term refusals.  Right now the tide has turned and most of my fellow officers and many men in the battalion are hooked on the show.

945427,A29R3O02O0PON4,B000BNI90Y,"Razr Maxx ""Metal Head""","[329, 368]","Like a previous reviewer mentioned, when Sci-Fi Channel announced that they were producing a new BSG show, I was causiously optimistic.  I was hoping that it would revive an old classic.  To a lot of people's surprise...it did.  In fact, the new Battlestar Galactica has been called the ""Best Show on TV"" by a lot of media organizations.  However it's getting some flak by a small but vocal group of die-hard fans of the original show.  So much so, that they have banned discussion of the new show on their web site.  Yes, I'm talking about you guys at 'CF.com'.  ""Family show...""  Eh?  Ahemmm...the new show was never billed as a family show.  It is clearly an adult drama set in space.  I'm as conservative as you all are, but I know the difference between '70's space cheese and 21st Century sci-fi.Anyway, for those who haven't seen this show, but you like a good character drama, be sure to check out this show on DVD.  I believe it's even better on DVD.  For one, you don't have the commercials and second, you don't have to wait between weeks for the the next episode.  There's a lot of continuity between episodes...and unlike Star Trek, they don't hit the proverbial ""Reset Button"" between episodes.  What's damaged on a ship in one episode stays damaged in following episodes, as the first season takes place just over a 3 month period.The second season here picks up right where the first season left off.  The major plot thread that was started with the first season's finale 2-part cliff-hanger, is built upon and concluded in the the first 5 or 6 episodes of the second season here.  The remaining couple of episodes are more of stand-alone type episodes that are probably building up to what is to occur in the second half of this season which will air from January thru March.Now then, why is Universal offering just a half season here?  Who really knows.  Although getting these episodes out before the second half airs is not really a bad thing, just a strange thing.  I guess since the show is such a hit, Universal figures that they could boost their ratings for the second half if they get all available episodes out on DVD before the second half airs.  This set, however, will include a ""90-minute"" (60 minute actual) version of the mid-season cliff-hanger episode ""Pegasus"".  So with that, there's at least some incentive to buy this set rather than wait for a possible full season set next year that may or may never come.UPDATE:  I've been informed by a very observant reader that my above post is inaccurate with some out of date false information.  I agree.  So without further adue, I'll update the info below.Above I said that a 60+ minute version of ""Pegasus"" was going to be included on this set.  That is incorrect.  First of all, that fact was just a rumor spawned by what was said during one of the Podcasts, I believe.  However, due to time constraints, Universal Studios was unable to ""ready"" the extended version of ""Pegasus"" for this release.  Why so?  Who knows...However, it has been reported that the extended version will be on the 2.5 set that will complete the second season.  So in essence, fans who have bought both sets will have both versions of this episode.  This is similar to the recent problem with the Stargate SG-1 Season 8 set in which the extended 60+ minute version of ""Threads"" was supposed to be included, but ultimately wasn't.  This was remedied by a mail-in offer done by CheckMyRebate.com.Also, I mention that a full season set, may or may not be offered eventually after the entire season is done airing.  After acquiring the 2.0 set, I noticed that there is a half of a image on the spine.  The image being one half of the Galactica Seal and President Roslin.  I assume the 2.5 set will have the other half of the Galactica Seal and presumably a pic of Commander/Admiral Adama.  So with that, I'm beginning to assume that a complete Season 2 set may not in the future.  Although I may be proven wrong...but we'll see.",5,First half of the sophomore season of a great show!,1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,3983,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'when', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'announced', 'were', 'producing', 'new', 'BSG', 'show', 'was', 'causiously', 'optimistic', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'revive', 'old', 'classic', 'lot', 'people', 'surprise', 'did', 'fact', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'been', 'called', 'Best', 'Show', 'TV', 'lot', 'media', 'organizations', 'However', 'getting', 'flak', 'small', 'vocal', 'group', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'original', 'show', 'So', 'much', 'have', 'banned', 'discussion', 'new', 'show', 'web', 'site', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'talking', 'guys', ""'CF.com"", 'Family', 'show', 'Eh', 'Ahemmm', 'new', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'billed', 'family', 'show', 'clearly', 'adult', 'drama', 'set', 'space', ""'m"", 'as', 'conservative', 'are', 'know', 'difference', ""'70"", 'space', 'cheese', '21st', 'Century', 'sci-fi.Anyway', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'good', 'character', 'drama', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'show', 'DVD', 'believe', 'even', 'better', 'DVD', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'commercials', 'second', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'weeks', 'next', 'episode', 'lot', 'continuity', 'episodes', 'Star', 'Trek', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'proverbial', 'Reset', 'Button', 'episodes', 'What', 'damaged', 'ship', 'one', 'episode', 'damaged', 'following', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'place', 'just', '3', 'month', 'period.The', 'second', 'season', 'here', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'first', 'season', 'left', 'off', 'major', 'plot', 'thread', 'was', 'started', 'first', 'season', 'finale', '2-part', 'cliff-hanger', 'built', 'concluded', 'first', '5', '6', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'here', 'remaining', 'couple', 'episodes', 'are', 'more', 'stand-alone', 'type', 'episodes', 'are', 'probably', 'building', 'up', 'what', 'occur', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'will', 'air', 'January', 'thru', 'March.Now', 'then', 'why', 'Universal', 'offering', 'just', 'half', 'season', 'here', 'Who', 'really', 'getting', 'episodes', 'out', 'second', 'half', 'airs', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'strange', 'thing', 'guess', 'show', 'such', 'hit', 'Universal', 'could', 'boost', 'ratings', 'second', 'half', 'get', 'available', 'episodes', 'out', 'DVD', 'second', 'half', 'airs', 'set', 'however', 'will', 'include', '90-minute', '60', 'minute', 'actual', 'version', 'mid-season', 'cliff-hanger', 'episode', 'Pegasus', 'So', 'least', 'incentive', 'buy', 'set', 'rather', 'wait', 'possible', 'full', 'season', 'set', 'next', 'year', 'may', 'may', 'never', 'come.UPDATE', ""'ve"", 'been', 'informed', 'very', 'observant', 'reader', 'post', 'inaccurate', 'date', 'false', 'information', 'agree', 'So', 'further', 'adue', ""'ll"", 'update', 'info', 'below.Above', 'said', '60+', 'minute', 'version', 'Pegasus', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'included', 'set', 'incorrect', 'First', 'all', 'fact', 'was', 'just', 'rumor', 'spawned', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'one', 'Podcasts', 'believe', 'However', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'was', 'unable', 'ready', 'extended', 'version', 'Pegasus', 'release', 'Why', 'so', 'Who', 'However', 'been', 'reported', 'extended', 'version', 'will', 'be', '2.5', 'set', 'will', 'complete', 'second', 'season', 'So', 'essence', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'bought', 'sets', 'will', 'have', 'versions', 'episode', 'similar', 'recent', 'problem', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'Season', '8', 'set', 'extended', '60+', 'minute', 'version', 'Threads', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'included', 'ultimately', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'remedied', 'mail-in', 'offer', 'done', 'CheckMyRebate.com.Also', 'mention', 'full', 'season', 'set', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'offered', 'eventually', 'entire', 'season', 'done', 'airing', 'acquiring', '2.0', 'set', 'noticed', 'half', 'image', 'spine', 'image', 'being', 'one', 'half', 'Galactica', 'Seal', 'President', 'Roslin', 'assume', '2.5', 'set', 'will', 'have', 'other', 'half', 'Galactica', 'Seal', 'presumably', 'pic', 'Commander/Admiral', 'Adama', 'So', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'assume', 'complete', 'Season', '2', 'set', 'may', 'not', 'future', 'may', 'be', 'proven', 'wrong', ""'ll"", 'see']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

Brokers ""cracker""","[4, 9]","I have a theory that near the end of a successful show these days, the ""money producers"" pull all the more talented writers onto new projects and leave ""stock"" writers to finish up the show (that already has an insured audience) in any plodding, insipid way they see fit. BSG Seasons 4 and 4.5 serve as strong evidence for this unfortunate practice.The first episodes of ""Caprica,"" or whatever other projects the ""good"" writers were redirected to, will be good television. I've had quite enough though, won't be fooled again, and won't be watching. It will be a long time before I spend time following another television show, as this treatment has killed many of my favorites over the last several years.As I trudged through these final BSG shows on DVD, the distress of the actors at being shortchanged of good material was visible and palpable in their performances, as most of the beloved characters became paper-thin, uninteresting fractions of their previous charm. Unlike any of the previous seasons, I found myself watching most of 4 and 4.5 on high speed, and still yawned.The edgy intelligent plots and plot devices are replaced with the most superficial tabloid level metaphysics imaginable in the final episodes, are we really watching BSG? or a rehash of ""Touched by an Angel?""

Donahue,"[8, 20]","I totally agree with previous comments regarding this last and final year of Battlestar Galactica.The first two seasons were so excellent that I could hardly wait for seasons 3 & 4 to come out on DVD.  Sadly - the peak of the series was Season 2 - with everything going downhill from there.This is a case where writers so completely lost the story line - that - we - the viewers were left with nothing short of a Gordian Knot of puzzles and riddles at the end.At the end - I wasn't sure whether I had just finished watching a science fiction film - or - a religious film - purporting Intelligent Design.I had expected an ending - (perhaps) - along the lines of the Wachowski brothers' excellent trilogy - The Matrix - where - Baltar & Number (Caprica) 6 were - (perhaps) holographs - or - avatars.But - then - more questions than answers.  In fact - there were no answers - just questions.If this were science - was this a case of parallel evolution - or - given the existence of an infinite number of ""multi-verses"" - a parallel universe?If this were science fiction - was this a case of human origins being the Cylons - in which case - evolution has come full circle?If this were religion - with a Divine Intelligence - micromanaging each and every nano-second - of - who lived - and - who died - - - was this a case of and ""endless loop"" of births and rebirths - for - creatures totally devoid of any free will?Were ""futuristic visions"" a case of an individual reliving the past - or - Intelligent Design - or - some sort of programming - genetic or otherwise?All said - this was a most disappointing fourth season - better left unmade.As a footnote: The beauty of Babylon 5 was: One writer - One vision - One thread - and - most importantly - no Gordian Knot left unraveled!",3,Season 4 was better left unmade.,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,1778,"['totally', 'agree', 'previous', 'comments', 'regarding', 'last', 'final', 'year', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica.The', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'so', 'excellent', 'could', 'hardly', 'wait', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'Sadly', 'peak', 'series', 'was', 'Season', '2', 'everything', 'going', 'downhill', 'there.This', 'case', 'where', 'writers', 'so', 'completely', 'lost', 'story', 'line', 'viewers', 'were', 'left', 'nothing', 'short', 'Gordian', 'Knot', 'puzzles', 'riddles', 'end.At', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'religious', 'film', 'purporting', 'Intelligent', 'Design.I', 'had', 'expected', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'lines', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'excellent', 'trilogy', 'Matrix', 'where', 'Baltar', 'Number', 'Caprica', '6', 'were', 'perhaps', 'holographs', 'avatars.But', 'then', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'fact', 'were', 'answers', 'just', 'questions.If', 'were', 'science', 'was', 'case', 'parallel', 'evolution', 'given', 'existence', 'infinite', 'number', 'multi-verses', 'parallel', 'universe', 'were', 'science', 'fiction', 'was', 'case', 'human', 'origins', 'being', 'Cylons', 'case', 'evolution', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'were', 'religion', 'Divine', 'Intelligence', 'micromanaging', 'nano-second', 'who', 'lived', 'who', 'died', 'was', 'case', 'endless', 'loop', 'births', 'rebirths', 'creatures', 'totally', 'devoid', 'free', 'will', 'Were', 'futuristic', 'visions', 'case', 'individual', 'reliving', 'past', 'Intelligent', 'Design', 'sort', 'programming', 'genetic', 'otherwise', 'said', 'was', 'most', 'disappointing', 'fourth', 'season', 'better', 'left', 'unmade.As', 'footnote', 'beauty', 'Babylon', '5', 'was', 'One', 'writer', 'One', 'vision', 'One', 'thread', 'most', 'importantly', 'Gordian', 'Knot', 'left', 'unraveled']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

Esbenshade,"[2, 2]","I have waited a bit to comment on the finale of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA...i have to admit i have very strong feelings about this show. it is one of those special things that only come along so often in our lives. now that i have watched the entire series and all the specials, including watching the final disc of season 4.5 three times now, i guess i can pass on my ramblings.i think this is the best show ever on TV.the writing remained strong , creative, and thought provoking the entire series. the political and metaphysical questions it posed are without a doubt the most adventurous ever put to the small screen. the characters were given traits that made us love and hate them. there was little black or white in the questions this show raised or with its characters. we learned much and questioned much about the human, and or cylon race as we watched. which one did WE come from anyway?many of the shows and their production values exceed anything we see in the theater these days. the last episode, watch the entire disc as one, is probably the greatest single endeavor ever on tv. i am sorry to see it over, but it ended as it should.i highly suggest you buy this entire series and watch it from beginning to end. question YOUR humanity while the crew tries to keep theirs. the noble acts and the atrocities...we are capable of it all.

945440,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000BNI90Y,Robert Moore,"[12, 16]","People who have an opinion about BATTLESTAR GALACTICA tend to fall into three camps.  First, there are those who dismiss it because it is Sci-fi and as a result have no interest in it.  After all, those Trekkie types have no real aesthetic judgment and will like just about anything as long as it has spaceships, lasers, robots, and aliens (nevermind that BSG has neither lasers nor aliens).  Second, there is the extremely small but rather fanatical group of fans of the original show (widely referred to as TOS) who are adamant that the new show (or GINO as they love to refer to it--""Galactica in name only"") simply must be a horror because, well, STARBUCK is a guy in the new series!  There is a third and rapidly growing group:  those who consider BATTLESTAR GALACTICA either the best show on TV or at the very least among the best.  Within the latter group there is a not insignificent group who wonder whether it might not be the best show in the history of television.The most important misunderstanding about BSG is that its appeal is primarily to the Sci-fi crowd.  It is one of those shows that absolutely destroys the limitations of genre.  That it is Sci-fi is almost irrelevant to its intrinsic importance.  Its being Sci-fi bears as little on its value as it does to Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD, or Orwell's 1984.  Imagine taking something like an IQ test.  You are given two columns.  Column One has listed THE SOPRANOS, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, THE SINGING DETECTIVE, BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, AND THE WEST WING (the early seasons anyway) and Column Two is STAR TREK, STARGATE SG-1, ANDROMEDA, and FARSCAPE.  The question is:  In which column is it more appropriate to place BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  The correct answer is:  Column One, with other shows considered among the greatest achievements in television history.  Sure, it also belongs in Column Two with other Sci-fi series, but we are talking about which is more appropriate.One of the most astonishing things about BSG has been the way that it has gotten better and better as it has gone along.  The miniseries that started things off was very good, but I wouldn't have described it as great.  Season One quickly entered the realm of greatness, but the first half of Season Two was even better.  And the shows on these discs, making up the second half of Season Two, are yet another step up.  And to show that sometimes you just have to trust the creative powers that be, while many fans were disappointed with the last few minutes of Season Two, with the series suddenly leaping forward a year to find a small human settlement on New Caprica, including many of the central crew members of Galatica.  Instantly some started crying that the show had jumped the shark (one of the least felicitous expressions in discussions of television).  Just as instantly with the start of Season Three, the sceptics have been proven wrong, as an already great show has gone to an even more spectacular level.Even though this set collects only ten episodes, almost everyone is memorable.  A few are among some of the finest individual episodes I've ever seen of any show.  The three-episode sequence featuring Michelle Forbes as Admiral Helena Cain, commander of the previously missing Pegasus, are especially strong with Forbes doing an amazing job as the heavy-handed and amoral Cain.  The final episode contains one of the most intense and disturbing sequences I've ever seen, as Adama, at Laura Roslin's urging, tells Starbuck to assassinate Cain upon being given a code word, unaware that Cain has similarly instructed one of her security officers to assassinate Adama upon a similar command.  It is a scene of almost unrelieved tension.  I've rarely been so completely on the edge of my seat as when watching that for the first time, as well as horrified by the real politik driving the characters' motives.  The episodes also feature a terrible moment when Sharon is about to be ""questioned"" by some human interrogators who view rape as an appropriate method.  There is also a great Starbuck-oriented episode involving the hunt for an especially gifted Cylon raider named Scar and some great plotlines about the rescue of the remaining humans on Caprica.  The season winds down with a presidential election and controversy surrounding the discovery of a planet capable of sustaining human life.More than anything--and this is what people who have not seen the series do not understand--this is a character and not a plot driven serial drama.  It does contain surprising and arresting story arcs, but the show is always more about the people who are participants in the drama than about the drama itself.  There has perhaps never been a Sci-fi series in which subtle facial expression has played such a crucial and central role.  The series does contain some amazing action sequences and some of the epic battle scenes can rival or surpass anything we've ever seen in the movies, but nothing can efface the centrality of the individuals--whether human or Cylon--at the heart of the story.To the distress of many on the political right, the show is also amazingly topical.  Yes, the perspective of the show as a whole is leftist, but there is no propaganda and never, ever an easy answer to political issues.  Many pressing contemporary issues are taken up on the show such as the role of torture in a democracy, the grasping of more power by an executive than allowed in a constitution, abortion, resistance to occupation, the relationship of the military to the civilian in a time of war, and a number of other issues.  But the show never provides answers to any of these questions.  I think the creators would like to do one thing for those on the Right.  The Right in America is astonishingly simplistic in its thinking, frequently couching issues in clear cut, black and white terms.  What I think Ron Moore and David Eick want to do is to complicate things, to show that things really are not black and white but a series of grays on a dark, foggy night.  If there is a political message in BSG, that is it:  things are never as simple as they seem.  The show doesn't want to provide answers, but merely make us suspicious of easy answers.  Season Three has gone on to create a situation that is remarkably similar to the current one in Iraq, with Cylons as the occupying force and humans employing suicide bombers in resistance.This is the best show on TV.  In both scope and ambition it has tried to do more than any other show I know and it has managed to do so magnificently.  As Matt Roush in TV Guide recently wrote, if you care about quality programming on television, this is the show you should care about.  The critical accolades have continued to barrage the show, with one critic after another proclaiming it the finest show on TV and even getting some amazingly prestigious awards such as its very own Peabody.  If you don't know this show, you need to.  It doesn't matter whether you like Sci-fi or not.  In fact, not knowing Sci-fi might be an advantage.  Sci-fi fans are often burdened by trite and sometimes silly loyalties (""Starbuck is a guy!"" is a prime example).  Those best in a position to love and care about this show are probably those who simply love quality TV regardless of the particular form that takes.  You really need to see this show.",5,The Best Show on TV just gets better and better,1160870400,"10 15, 2006",2006,7358,"['People', 'who', 'have', 'opinion', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'tend', 'fall',

In this tail-end of season two, the story of the rag-tag fleet that comprises humanity edges ever closer thematically to 9/11 and the war in Iraq.  The last half of the season climaxed with the reunion with BS Pegasus and the legendary Commander Cain.  It's now revealed that Cain (excellent Michelle Forbes) is a brutal autocrat, and has molded her crew in her own image.  Commander Adama and President Roselin - reluctant allies until now - must solidify their position against Cain when it proves that she's very much a wolf in shepherd's clothing.  Meanwhile, Baltar's connection to the Cylons grows stronger - ironically when he discovers Cain to be holding a Cylon, another ""Six"" that has been brutalized on Cain's orders. Emboldened and yet beholden to the Cylons, Baltar will make his political move against Laura.  We also get more Cylon perspectives when joining Six and D'anna (Lucy Lawless) as they tour the ruined world of Caprica.  (The series actually inverts the Iraq parable in the next season with human beings running an insurgency while under the occupation of Cylons - apparently, we've become the Cylons, only when tragedy strikes, instead of changing the channel, the Cylons merely download to a new body.)  In between that, we have many stand-alone episodes - Starbuck competes against her fierce rival Kat as the two hunt an implacable Cylon; Apollo must deal with the growing criminal rot infecting the fleet; there's a do-or-die battle to destroy the Cylon's ""resurrection ship""; Dean Stockwell appears as another Cylon - he essays his Cylon as a very human amalgam, part statesmen, part businessman, part religious visionary.This is a must-have unmissable set.  Despite carping about a season's price tag for half a season's worth of shows, I was consistently surprised at how much of the series was advanced in this season alone.  That isn't to say that it's been a perfect ride - we may just have been shown too much of the Cylons who at times prove boring, confusing or stupid instead of effectively manipulative as they were at the outset.  Too much of the plot revolves around multiple incarnations of the same Cylon.  That said, fans who reveled in last season's mix of gritty character development and top-notch effects won't be disappointed with this box.",4,Season 2.5 keeps the series near top-speed,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,2322,"['split-season', 'BSG', 'tail-end', 'season', 'two', 'story', 'rag-tag', 'fleet', 'humanity', 'edges', 'ever', 'closer', 'thematically', '9/11', 'war', 'Iraq', 'last', 'half', 'season', 'climaxed', 'reunion', 'BS', 'Pegasus', 'legendary', 'Commander', 'Cain', 'now', 'revealed', 'Cain', 'excellent', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'brutal', 'autocrat', 'molded', 'crew', 'own', 'image', 'Commander', 'Adama', 'President', 'Roselin', 'reluctant', 'allies', 'now', 'must', 'solidify', 'position', 'Cain', 'when', 'very', 'much', 'wolf', 'shepherd', 'clothing', 'Meanwhile', 'Baltar', 'connection', 'Cylons', 'stronger', 'ironically', 'when', 'Cain', 'be', 'holding', 'Cylon', 'Six', 'been', 'brutalized', 'Cain', 'orders', 'Emboldened', 'yet', 'beholden', 'Cylons', 'Baltar', 'will', 'make', 'political', 'move', 'Laura', 'also', 'get', 'more', 'Cylon', 'perspectives', 'when', 'joining', 'Six', ""D'anna"", 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'tour', 'ruined', 'world', 'Caprica', 'series', 'actually', 'Iraq', 'parable', 'next', 'season', 'human', 'beings', 'running', 'insurgency', 'occupation', 'Cylons', 'apparently', ""'ve"", 'become', 'Cylons', 'only', 'when', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'instead', 'changing', 'channel', 'Cylons', 'merely', 'new', 'body', 'have', 'many', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'Starbuck', 'fierce', 'rival', 'Kat', 'two', 'hunt', 'implacable', 'Cylon', 'Apollo', 'must', 'deal', 'growing', 'criminal', 'rot', 'infecting', 'fleet', 'do-or-die', 'battle', 'destroy', 'Cylon', 'resurrection', 'ship', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Cylon', 'Cylon', 'very', 'human', 'amalgam', 'part', 'statesmen', 'part', 'businessman', 'part', 'religious', 'visionary.This', 'must-have', 'unmissable', 'set', 'carping', 'season', 'price', 'tag', 'season', 'worth', 'shows', 'was', 'consistently', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'series', 'was', 'advanced', 'season', 'alone', ""n't"", 'say', 'been', 'perfect', 'ride', 'may', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'too', 'much', 'Cylons', 'who', 'times', 'prove', 'boring', 'confusing', 'stupid', 'instead', 'effectively', 'manipulative', 'were', 'outset', 'Too', 'much', 'plot', 'around', 'multiple', 'incarnations', 'same', 'Cylon', 'said', 'fans', 'who', 'reveled', 'last', 'season', 'mix', 'gritty', 'character', 'development', 'top-notch', 'effects', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'box']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)
945445,A2B6EBLE32P6VR,B000BNI90Y,"R. Pichlik ""EWTN fan""","[11, 17]","Now the series is over.  I don't know for sure what I'm going to do with my Friday nights anymore; not much of a fan of ""tv series"", but I made sure to be in front of the tube every Friday night for this show.  Can I say it was perfect; no, very few things are.  However, this show came about as close to perfection as I can imagine.  Where the original series, (which I watch regularly), fell into the formulaic trap of journey, conflict, fight and escape this series managed to become original by becoming spiritual.  I've heard some say that the foray down this path began to ruin the show, however, I think that this is what made the show compelling, engrossing and engaging.  The notion that for four years we were led to believe that perhaps Baltar was a cylon or insane only to find out that he was being guided by an angel I would have never imagined.  I've read on some blogs the speculation that Starbuck was also an angel; I personally don't think so.  The Caprica and Baltar angels were self possessed, in control and seemed to know what they were and what they were doing.  Contrast that description with Starbuck; confused, obsessed with a sense of a calling, but confused as to what that calling was as well as trying to avoid having to respond to that calling.  I think I've got a better description; she was a prophet, a little bit of a cross between Moses and Jonah.  Like Moses she had a mission to lead her people, but like Jonah she didn't want to do what she was called to do; Jonah committed virtual suicide being swallowed and Starbuck did commit suicide to; both to escape what God wanted them to do.  However, in both instances God's plans aren't thwarted that easily; Starbuck found herself brought back from the dead just as Jonah was brought back from the deep to fulfill his mission.  Anyway, that's just my spin; hollywood and tv popularize the notion that angels are human souls, i.e. Clarence from Its a Wonderful Life; and this is theologically erroneous, as angels are a class of creatures unto themselves.  I thought the conclusion of this series was touching, moving and entirely satisfying.  I found the redemption of Baltar very satisfying; unlike the original series which I found his motivation always puzzling in this series he was portrayed as a flawed human who ""sinned"" by giving in to his base desires and passions, (lust/sex).  We are all susceptible to this, it's just that most of us when we stumble don't bring down mankind with us.  So, I really liked the idea that he finally committed an unselfish act, and in the end was no longer ashamed of his humble beginnings.  We should all be so fortunate to be able to make that journey while still alive.",5,An epic ending to an epic series,1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,2700,"['Now', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'what', ""'m"", 'going', 'do', 'Friday', 'nights', 'anymore', 'not', 'much', 'fan', 'tv', 'series', 'made', 'sure', 'be', 'front', 'tube', 'Friday', 'night', 'show', 'Can', 'say', 'was', 'perfect', 'very', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'However', 'show', 'came', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'perfection', 'can', 'imagine', 'Where', 'original', 'series', 'watch', 'regularly', 'fell', 'formulaic', 'trap', 'journey', 'conflict', 'fight', 'escape', 'series', 'managed', 'become', 'original', 'becoming', 'spiritual', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'say', 'foray', 'down', 'path', 'began', 'ruin', 'show', 'however', 'think', 'made', 'show', 'compelling', 'engrossing', 'engaging', 'notion', 'four', 'years', 'were', 'led', 'believe', 'perhaps', 'Baltar', 'was', 'cylon', 'insane', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'being', 'guided', 'angel', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'imagined', ""'ve"", 'read', 'blogs', 'speculation', 'Starbuck', 'was', 'also', 'angel', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Caprica', 'Baltar', 'angels', 'were', 'possessed', 'control', 'seemed', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'Contrast', 'description', 'Starbuck', 'confused', 'obsessed', 'sense', 'calling', 'confused', 'what', 'calling', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'trying', 'avoid', 'having', 'respond', 'calling', 'think', ""'ve"", 'got', 'better', 'description', 'was', 'prophet', 'little', 'bit', 'cross', 'Moses', 'Jonah', 'Moses', 'had', 'mission', 'lead', 'people', 'Jonah', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'do', 'Jonah', 'committed', 'virtual', 'suicide', 'being', 'swallowed', 'Starbuck', 'did', 'commit', 'suicide', 'escape', 'what', 'God', 'wanted', 'do', 'However', 'instances', 'God', 'plans', 'are', ""n't"", 'thwarted', 'easily', 'Starbuck', 'found', 'brought', 'back', 'dead', 'just', 'Jonah', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'deep', 'fulfill', 'mission', 'Anyway', 'just', 'spin', 'hollywood', 'tv', 'popularize', 'notion', 'angels', 'are', 'human', 'souls', 'i.e', 'Clarence', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'theologically', 'erroneous', 'angels', 'are', 'class', 'creatures', 'unto', 'thought', 'conclusion', 'series', 'was', 'touching', 'moving', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'found', 'redemption', 'Baltar', 'very', 'satisfying', 'original', 'series', 'found', 'motivation', 'always', 'puzzling', 'series', 'was', 'portrayed', 'flawed', 'human', 'who', 'sinned', 'giving', 'base', 'desires', 'passions', 'lust/sex', 'are', 'susceptible', 'just', 'most', 'when', 'stumble', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'down', 'mankind', 'So', 'really', 'liked', 'idea', 'finally', 'committed', 'unselfish', 'act', 'end', 'was', 'longer', 'ashamed', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'fortunate', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'journey', 'still', 'alive']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

I remember loving the original series when I was a kid- but even then knew it was an attempt to cash-in on the Star Wars bandwagon.  As a middle-aged adult, I had every expectation of this show being strictly a geek-fodder, lowbrow CGI fest. But this show is something else entirely.  But the storyline is actually ridiculously compelling, especially as you move through the series and get into season 3 and start to explore the Cylon perspective. The analogs to contemporary America are thought-provoking and frequently alarming. The characters sometimes drift into cut-out caricatures, but then some new revelation drops and the entire frame of reference for these characters shifts radically into something orders of magnitude removed from workaday sci-fi action figures. The art direction is spectacular: the shots of the various ships moving in space are really quite beautiful, the way the ships move seems entirely realistic and true to motion in zero-gravity environments.

945452,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000BNI90Y,Sean Pasek,"[6, 6]","Season 1 of Battlestar Galactica was fantastic.  The first 10 episodes of Season 2 takes this show to a whole new level.  All of the elements that made Season 1 so good are back, and then some!Aside from a few other shows out there, I dare anyone to find a television show that has more rich and compelling stories from one episode to another.  There is no lull.  It doesn't drop off, or take an episode ""off"" after one that has been especially intense.Also, there are no ""accidents"" or special effects thrown in for the sake of putting in an action sequence just to keep you interested in the story.  There is a reason for everything that happens in these stories.  Two Cylon Raiders appear to be closing in to attack the Galactica.  Older and less sophisticated shows may have placed this part in for the sake of an action sequence.  Not here.  There is a reason for it that is an integral part of the story.One of the best things about Battlestar Galactica is that it reveres the intelligence of its viewers.  They don't play down to you.  They know there might be a bit of lingo, or something going on in a scene that you might not get right off.  That's okay.  They trust that you will be able to put the pieces together and trust the reasoning behind what's going on in the story.  Instead of starting you off with a 500-piece puzzle, it's like starting you off with a 5,000 or even 10,000 piece puzzle.  They know you'll get it.  What's better, is that a show like this is perfect on DVD because it invites repeated viewings where you will find things you may have missed or overlooked the first time out.The pacing of the show is quick.  The camera shots are short and fast, especially during a combat sequence.  The confusion is intentional, as the writers and directors want you to feel the way the characters feel.Season 2 starts off just after Boomer has shot Commander Adama.  The first 4 episodes cover his struggle to survive.  This brings me to another great detail about this show.  Everything takes time.  You don't watch one episode where someone was hurt, and boom, they're suddenly healed in the next because several weeks have probably gone by.  No, here the scars and wounds stay their course.The power struggle between Adama and Tigh continues with President Roslin, whom they believe has lost her mind to religious fantacisim.  She's determined to go to Kobol and find the Tomb of Athena which may have clues to how to find Earth.  The episode where they enter this tomb is awesome, and I won't say any more about it here.Starbuck has her struggles on Caprica as she recovers the Arrow of Apollo, but is left with the question of how to get back to the fleet.Then one of the most compelling story-lines continues, which concerns Sharon ""Boomer"" Valeri.  By now, everyone in the fleet knows she's a Cylon.  How does one deal with that?  This is handled from the perspective of most of the key characters.  Eventually, it asks the question concerning ""living"" and ""non-living"" things.  Although she's a Cylon, can she feel?  Can she feel and give love?  What separates the ""man/woman"" from the ""machine?""  Or, is she simply manipulating everyone?  This is one question alone which invites the viewer to keep coming back for more!Season 2.0 ends with the first part of ""Pegasus,"" which takes off loosely from the first series, where the Galactica and her crew stumbles upon the Battlestar Pegasus, commanded by Admiral Helena Cain.  Cain has her own views of how to run the fleet, and since she out-ranks Adama, she has complete authority in all military matters, including how she feels Cylon prisoners should be handled.  Only after finally challenging her authority, does the makings of a huge combat fight in space between two Battlestars threaten to take place.

Then....i fell hard for the show and it's characters.I can't gush enough about it...i am undoubtedly annoying all my friends and family.

He just steals every scene he's in, even if he doesn't speak a word! What would the show be without him? He centers everybody. Starbuck is one tough chick but underneath it all she has a tender heart and Apollo is just hot. They would make a great couple. Hehehe. Another thing i really like about the show is that the female characters are so strong. They aren't just there to dress up the scenery.The girl that plays Cylon Sharon is a great character and i really feel for her even though she's suposed to be a machine.

I think I would have to say it is the great cast who carry this show, because anyone who watches will have to admit that it is primarily a drama first and foremost, but drama's are only good when they have good actors to pull it off. My biggest gripe though is that the SciFi and action are relegated to a back seat. It is not uncommon in this series for the story to be leading up to a full scale battle, only to then cut to a scene after the battle is over...or better yet have an entire space dogfight that is conducted via radio transmission but never actually seen. I can only hope season three might garner a better budget to allow for more special effects. Then perhaps this series can become something great, rather than just good.Having said that, the series does give you some action and SciFi on occasion to add a little spice to the drama.I'm sure people have debated to death the comparison's of this series to the original BSG series so for my two cents I will only tell you that there is no comparison. They aren't even the same show at all. In fact I wish they had chosen a new name for this series, and left the original on the shelf collecting dust...While it is true that the show presents many characters with liberal views, not least among them the president Roslin herself, I also feel the show does a good job of presenting characters, such as commander Adama, who have conservative views, and it is interesting how these differing views enter into the drama and the war that they face. Invariably, whenever the humans stray too far in either direction they end up facing possible annihilation all over again..I also was disappointed that the second season was split, but apparently since there were 20 episodes in season two and 13 in season one, the format for season two doesn't seem too unreasonable to me.

These three CDs contain only the first 10 episodes of season two.  We'll have to wait a while for the last half of the season.The backstory is that the robotic cylons have attacked and nearly exterminated the human race.  Only the Battlestar Galactica and its motley fleet remain and it is infiltrated by cylons in human form.  The objective of the BG is not victory but simple survival and a hiding place. Season two opens with a bang: Captain Adama is unconscious on the operating table and Colonel Tigh is in control of the Galactica and the fleet. Tigh proves not to be up to the job. I like Tigh -- very well acted by Michael Hogan -- because he is a vastly imperfect person plauged by a sexy, shrewy wife, alcohol addiction, insubordinate underlings, and his own aversion to leadership. But he's a competent shipdriver and loyal to Adama. Predictably, things get even worse as the season goes on, with the underlying theme of conflict between civilian and military authorities, father and son, lovers and losers, cylons and man....These folks know trouble.  And there's no end to it.  Every episode gets them deeper into the muck.What makes this series special is its exploration of human relationships and fralities in a hyper-tense situation.  Every one of about 10 major characters is distinctive and finely drawn. There's plenty of shoot-em-up adventure too, led by the bawdy, hot-shot pilot Starbuck and Captain Adama's tortured son, Lee. Add a few hot and heavy love scenes, a touch of religous mysticism, and you have sci-fi noir bred with space opera. The constant theme of suspicion and mistrust makes every episode a nail-biter. Who's a cylon and who's not?  What are the cylons' objectives?  Stay tuned.

945459,A3L14D8BAREUSV,B000BNI90Y,SteamaZon,"[4, 7]","Spoilers abound , and though I did not give too much away, if one has not seen the conclusion, this commentary should be passed on.  The fourth season now ends with most of the loose ends tied up and  few unanswered questions, but the ambiguity of the program and its moral relevance or irrelevance with references to religion and prejudices will fodder many a conversation around the water cooler for months / years to come.  If one has the first 3 seasons, it certainly follows that this is a MUST own,  it tidy's things up and brings a definite end and does so in a continuous way.  I have not gotten the DVD set yet, so I cannot comment on its quality (horrors if it is double-sided DVD's) but reserve comments for the show itself plus ancillary remarks.  I'll not give too much away, but once released, it's nice to watch a year's worth of episodes in a few days without commercial interruption.  However, I must admit some interruptions make for a pregnant pause indeed, creating a much more poignant scene because of the wait.Plot holes are galore, but manageable and do not detract, in my opinion from the overall quality of the series.  For example, when the crewmember had the gun trained on the Cylon leader (under truce), why did no one attempt to disarm this person?  There were at least 6 armed humans there in escort, plenty of time to just say NO and in many ways that scene seemed entirely absurd.  Another regarded one of the Final 5 Cylons that was to be airlocked by the humans unless handed over to the Cylons.  These Cylons revered the Final 5 and wanted them so they could "" be protected and cared for"".  But this Final 5 was troubled with  the Cylonic method of persuasion.  Why did the Humans not simply put this Final 5 Cylon on the Comm with the Cylons?!?  This final 5 would have given the Cylon leader such a blistering of earful language, paint would have peeled from the bulkheads.  Maybe cliffhanger action is far more exciting to a viewing audience than salty talk and so that's what happened.On the other hand, the reintroduction of a once demised character was extremely well done and added much intrigue and interest to the overall plot.  The complexities of developing Cylon relationships amongst themselves mirrored some of the problems the Humans were having.  One of the Final 5 completely identified with the Cylons and even their ways whereas one of the others was in rejection of it.  The contrast here was interesting to follow.Galactica the Reimagining RMG is now done and over with though there may be other spinoff shows to follow (yes I'll probably get them all at this point).I first became enamored with Galactica the Original Series TOS back in 1979 when I first learned of it in a New York Creative convention.  There was some initial controversy I heard about regarding  some people who wanted to pursue legal action  against them.  One was rumored to be  Lucas Studios because the Cylon Centurions looked too similar to their Star War stormtroopers.  Once the show was underway, however, I think these concerns may have died away as I did not hear anymore about it.  With the exception of their initial appearance, the Cylons, of course, were quite dissimilar to the stormtroopers.Every Sunday night it became a ritual to watch  the Galactica and its escorted fleet trying to escape the merciless Cylons.  Occasional forays into ""camp"" and stupidity did not mar the program.  The seriousness and  respect  Lorne Greene of Bonanza fame brought to the show cannot be underestimated.  But, an enemy worse than Cylons halted the flight of humans to the mythical earth--Network economics.  From what I read in a magazine, it cost a million to make Galactica (a huge amount per episode compared to other shows).  And so the show was moved around in different  time slots until it was cancelled.  Galactica 1980 appeared a short time later and got the fleet to Earth.  Since the sets weren't as snazzy it certainly must have been less to produce.  But it disappeared from the airwaves as well leaving much entirely unresolved.It was my understanding that Galactica TOS introduced the Cylons as a robotic race that were once organics, but incorporated so much machinery into themselves, they became an immense amount of hardware built around an organic core.  Later I came to learn that a long dead reptilian race created the AI  robots, but the AI's  revolted, wiped out their original creators and were now bent on placing their version of order on the galaxy, which included exterminating the imperfect humans.Galactica RMG just decided to make this problem one that originated with the humans, rather than someone else's Frankenstein's Monster experiment gone array.  Thus the now Humans created the Cybernetic Living Organism Node or  Cylon.This may have been the result of Terminator movies, Blade Runner, Star Trek the Next Generation and its offspring, Space above and Beyond, one cannot say for sure.  Even now in the real world there is the ongoing quest for the creation of a non cheating AI to just play a computer game (among other things).  In literature and film, Man  creates in his own image and soon his creation now demands rights and respect.Galactica RMG takes this further in rather a surprise twist that I have not thought about before (maybe one of the Treks had it). Man creates AI.  AI revolts or otherwise departs from its creators.  It itself evolves and creates its OWN ai subclass.  THAT subclass revolts with nuclear war and its messiness.  Or maybe these ancient Cylons just has a serious disagreement amongst themselves which had nothing to do with a sub AI class and just went atomic on each other.  It's  a revelation to the show's current Cylons that this could happen to them as well.  Humans are not the root of all evil for Cylons are quite capable of creating their own.In any case, I thought Galactica RMG played well into the current questions that humanity may have to answer for itself about the extent AI and robotics will take in future endeavors and conflicts.  Pilotless planes are already involved in combat operations.  It is not a stretch to expect some ground vehicles to follow and I suspect the first robotic infantrymen will be remote controlled as well.  It will be a long time before anything developed can actually become self aware and suddenly concerned about its own welfare and status quo.  But, one ever knows what breakthroughs may occur.  The first really sentient AI will probably be in an immobile box and it might be quite awhile before it is allowed to manipulate anything in the physical world.  But this need not be a handicap for that AI; as the AI development occurs, so would parallel work on complex virtual environments (as what occur in online games for example) and would be a schoolroom and playground for the fledgling AI to develop in.One science fiction show (Space Above and Beyond) explored what happened during an AI revolt.  Mankind went on to develop cloning and grew people in wet-tanks to fight the AI's and then later be employed in dirty and dangerous jobs no one else wanted.  This opened up the same can of worms as they earlier had with the AI's.  The cloned people or ""tanks"" (they were grown in a literal tank), wanted rights and respect and the show always had  tension between the clones and those who came out of the womb.  Unfortunately, this show did not survive and explore as many issues as Galactica RMG did, but I consider it an important forerunner of serious, ambiguous, thought provoking science fiction.This is not to say Star Trek and its derivatives did not have its serious moments, they got the train moving for science fiction beyond the Lost in Space and Steve Zodiac stuff.  Battlestar RMG, in my view approached tough problems with no easy answers; some by leaving them unresolved and moving onto something else.

I wouldn't mind it IF they were releasing a combined set as well, and don't rule that out down the road.  The only advantage to the way they did it was that those of us who were behind in the middle of Season 2 were able to get the first half and catch up.Marketing ploys aside, this is still the best show on TV (with LOST a close second).  Sadly, many people are missing out because they don't realize this is nothing like the hokey 70s version of the series (or because they can't stand the fact that it isn't! LOL).  But the fact is, what we have here is a fantastic drama with one of the best assembled casts.  Great writing and pacing - effects that are simply too good for TV - and a compelling millitary drama that ""just happens"" to be set in space.  I urge those of you who like your shows gritty and honest, with action thrown in and twists aplenty - give BSG a chance!As I mentioned in the title, the only thing I didn't like this season was the last 15 minutes of the last episode.  It took things in a totally different direction (kudos for originality) and it will remain to be seen in season three if they have painted themselves into a corner, or are setting us up for something truly great.  As it is, I might have ended Season 2 with the big event that happens 15 minutes prior to the ending (those who saw it know what I mean) and thus left it as a real nail-biting cliffhanger.At any rate - split set and all - this is still the best show on TV and DVD!",4,One of the Strangest season endings in TV history - but many great episodes this year!,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,1507,"['OK', 'split', 'thing', 'annoying', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'IF', 'were', 'releasing', 'combined', 'set', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'rule', 'out', 'road', 'only', 'advantage', 'way', 'did', 'was', 'who', 'were', 'behind', 'middle', 'Season', '2', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'first', 'half', 'catch', 'up.Marketing', 'ploys', 'aside', 'still', 'best', 'show', 'TV', 'LOST', 'close', 'second', 'Sadly', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'nothing', 'hokey', '70s', 'version', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'fact', ""n't"", 'LOL', 'fact', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'fantastic', 'drama', 'one', 'best', 'assembled', 'casts', 'Great', 'writing', 'pacing', 'effects', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'good', 'TV', 'compelling', 'millitary', 'drama', 'just', 'be', 'set', 'space', 'urge', 'who', 'shows', 'gritty', 'honest', 'action', 'thrown', 'twists', 'aplenty', 'give', 'BSG', 'chance', 'mentioned', 'title', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'season', 'was', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'last', 'episode', 'took', 'things', 'totally', 'different', 'direction', 'kudos', 'originality', 'will', 'remain', 'be', 'seen', 'season', 'three', 'have', 'painted', 'corner', 'are', 'setting', 'up', 'something', 'truly', 'great', 'might', 'have', 'ended', 'Season', '2', 'big', 'event', '15', 'minutes', 'prior', 'ending', 'who', 'saw', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'thus', 'left', 'real', 'nail-biting', 'cliffhanger.At', 'rate', 'split', 'set', 'still', 'best', 'show', 'TV', 'DVD']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)
945461,A2KBF2OYR359AJ,B000BNI90Y,"Steven R. McEvoy ""MCWPP""","[100, 106]","This new Battlestar Galactica 2.5 DVD boxset release is full of special features and bonus material to attract all viewers. The split season format is great. It airs as half seasons on Sci-Fi and they release it to match its airing schedule and system. There are so many special features, you could spend more time watching them then the actual episodes.One of the greatest bonuses to the set is the much anticipated and greatly debated extended version of the episode `Pegasus' this special version is over an hour and a half long it was not aired in this format due to time constraints. It views like a feature movie. It has amazing special effects and amazing cinematography.Other features include deleted scenes, which are broken down by episodes, include the producer's podcasts that aired on the Sci-Fi channel's website during the original airings, and the producer's video Logs and much much more. The deletes scenes are broken down episode by episode.The bonus material, if not ignored, will help viewers better understand the choices made in preparing the episodes and the season for release.This half of season 2 has many unique twits and turns in the plots and lives of the characters. We are also introduced to new human cylon models. As to the content itself, in this half of season 2 the central character is Sharon,with her actions developed alongside those of (spoiler alert!) those of a few different Cylon version of her. Byond Sharon's development on Batlestar Galactica and Battlestar Pegasus, which is presented as strongly intertwined with the fate of the whole human race, a great deal of the season deals with relationships - Professional and otherwise - and especially friendships. Striking interactions occur between President Roslyn and Commander Adama; in the complicated relationship between Starbuck and Apollo; with Sharon and, well just about everybody.In the broader scheme of things, by this point in the series the complexities of guiding a free population while trying to avoid the Cylon army has taken it's toll on both military and civilian leaders of this rag-tag group of humans trying to find a new home on a lost planet called Earth.The excellent character development in this half of the season can be attributed to very strong scriptwriting. The cliffhanger ending leaves you mouth watering and you desperately awaiting season 3 - which hopefully, after snagging this DVD set, you can finally get caught up in watching. The Sci-Fi channel has to date released 4 of 10 web episodes that have story line development between season's 2 and 3. Season 3 begins airing in the US and Canada on October 7th for the first time the episodes will air in both countries at the same time. We here in Canada will not have to wait days, weeks or months for the US show to finally come to Canada.BSG is often called the best Sci-fi on television and Newsweek has gone so far as to call it the best drama on TV.

This final season is a mixture of the excellent and the corny (details would amount to spoilers, so I'll say no more than that), and this especially is true of the double episode, which also features a rather nice twist. In addition, given that the Earth seekers all had European-type names assured that the search for Earth could have only ended in one of two ways, it was nice to get both.I could have wished for a better ending, and a better resolution (and in some cases any resolution at all) of some of the outstanding questions, but overall the standard was high, and, I thought, always entertaining.

945468,ANM9NWZSNSQ9Q,B000BNI90Y,Theresa Flynn,"[5, 5]","The new ""Battlestar Galactica"" isn't just a great sci-fi show - it's a great show, period.  You know you are in for a treat when luminous stars like Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell don't stand out from an ensemble of gifted and exciting young actors.  That's just where we begin...now take a moment to thank Executive Producers David Eick, Ronald D. Moore and Toni Graphia for re-envisioning this 70s cult series in a way that is hard to articulate, much less imagine.  Undoubtedly influenced by the ""post-9/11"" aura that surrounds much art these days, this dark and troubled story continually asks the big questions - ""What is true faith?""  ""What does it mean to be human?"" And...""Are we the good guys?""  When the Cylons seem to have a greater spiritual life than the humans, you know you are in for good drama.  Much like ""24"", ""Battlestar Galactica"" manages to find heart-stopping action while going at an achingly slow ""real-time"" pace...the cliff-hangers from week to week leave you on the edge of your seat, and it can take a season (or more) to resolve a mystery you are just dying to know about.  Along the way, more plotlines are woven in, and you find yourself hopelessly hooked (which is why the DVDs are so terrific...they allow you to blast through the entire first two seasons without the wait - and make for a great marathon viewing).  Adding to that sense of anticipation is one of the best scores written for a television series today - tribal drumbeats composed by Richard Gibbs and Bear McCreary that elevate this excellent show's action from ""great"" to ""epic"".  It's a show where you find yourself rooting for folks.  There are many choices.  Pretty Brit boy Jamie Bamber has an addictive energy combined with honest intensity that makes everything ""Apollo"" does seem justified.  Katee Sackoff gets extra kudos for putting up with the criticism from the original series fans.  She brings a complexity and depth to ""Starbuck"" that makes you see this character as not male, female, butch, femme, but fully rounded, and fully human.  She is, perhaps, the one character we absolutely know is not a Cylon - her struggle to find her life's path is just too real.  James Callis, another cute Brit, does an admirable turn as Gaius Baltar, the man who betrays humanity.  His psychological meanderings have been ground for one of the few criticisms of the series, becoming almost too overarching in Season One, something quickly corrected by Season Two.  These ""out of body"" moments are not to be dismissed, however.  His dialogues with Tricia Helfer's ""Cylon Six"" create the ethical foundation, and some of the most provocative moments, in the series.  Tricia Helfer is one of those women born to be a sex symbol, but to her credit she makes an interesting and excellent foil for Baltar's tortured struggle.  Grace Park does an admirable job portraying a woman who does not fully understand who she is, while Kandyse McClure finally gets her well-earned shot as a very likeable subordinate from whose eyes we can see the greater struggles.  For folks who like the ongoing eye-candy factor, Tahmoh Penikett fills the bill and more...given an impossible situation, he tries to just do ""the right thing"".  Fans of the original series will not be disappointed.  Richard Hatch, the original ""Apollo"" does an absolutely stunning turn as a terrorist turned politician.  How very apt.  This is not the ""bells and whistles"" series from a tech standpoint.  Unlike so many sci-fi series of late, there is paper, and telephones, and when people get injured they stay that way for a while ... no magic hypo-sprays.  But it is in this low-tech future that we can see the people, and they shine in the darkness.  The DVD sets should thrill fans of the series, being packed with extras that were first marketed online as the early episodes unfolded.  Definitely a must-own for any fan of good television.",5,As Good As It Gets,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,3905,"['new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', ""n't"", 'just', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'great', 'show', 'period', 'know', 'are', 'treat', 'when', 'luminous', 'stars', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'ensemble', 'gifted', 'exciting', 'young', 'actors', 'just', 'where', 'begin', 'now', 'take', 'moment', 'thank', 'Executive', 'Producers', 'David', 'Eick', 'Ronald', 'D.', 'Moore', 'Toni', 'Graphia', 're-envisioning', '70s', 'cult', 'series', 'way', 'hard', 'articulate', 'much', 'less', 'imagine', 'Undoubtedly', 'influenced', 'post-9/11', 'aura', 'much', 'days', 'dark', 'troubled', 'story', 'continually', 'big', 'questions', 'What', 'true', 'faith', 'What', 'mean', 'be', 'human', 'Are', 'good', 'guys', 'When', 'Cylons', 'seem', 'have', 'greater', 'spiritual', 'life', 'humans', 'know', 'are', 'good', 'drama', 'Much', '24', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'find', 'heart-stopping', 'action', 'going', 'achingly', 'slow', 'real-time', 'pace', 'cliff-hangers', 'week', 'week', 'leave', 'edge', 'seat', 'can', 'take', 'season', 'more', 'resolve', 'mystery', 'are', 'just', 'dying', 'know', 'about', 'way', 'more', 'plotlines', 'are', 'woven', 'find', 'hopelessly', 'hooked', 'why', 'DVDs', 'are', 'so', 'terrific', 'allow', 'blast', 'entire', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'wait', 'make', 'great', 'marathon', 'viewing', 'Adding', 'sense', 'anticipation', 'one', 'best', 'scores', 'written', 'television', 'series', 'today', 'tribal', 'drumbeats', 'composed', 'Richard', 'Gibbs', 'Bear', 'McCreary', 'elevate', 'excellent', 'show', 'action', 'great', 'epic', 'show', 'where', 'find', 'rooting', 'folks', 'are', 'many', 'choices', 'Pretty', 'Brit', 'boy', 'Jamie', 'Bamber', 'addictive', 'energy', 'combined', 'honest', 'intensity', 'everything', 'Apollo', 'seem', 'justified', 'Katee', 'Sackoff', 'extra', 'kudos', 'putting', 'up', 'criticism', 'original', 'series', 'fans', 'complexity', 'depth', 'Starbuck', 'see', 'character', 'not', 'male', 'female', 'butch', 'femme', 'fully', 'rounded', 'fully', 'human', 'perhaps', 'one', 'character', 'absolutely', 'know', 'not', 'Cylon', 'struggle', 'find', 'life', 'path', 'just', 'too', 'real', 'James', 'Callis', 'cute', 'Brit', 'admirable', 'turn', 'Gaius', 'Baltar', 'man', 'who', 'humanity', 'psychological', 'meanderings', 'have', 'been', 'ground', 'one', 'few', 'criticisms', 'series', 'becoming', 'almost', 'too', 'overarching', 'Season', 'One', 'something', 'quickly', 'corrected', 'Season', 'Two', 'body', 'moments', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'dismissed', 'however', 'dialogues', 'Tricia', 'Helfer', 'Cylon', 'Six', 'create', 'ethical', 'foundation', 'most', 'provocative', 'moments', 'series', 'Tricia', 'Helfer', 'one', 'women', 'born', 'be', 'sex', 'symbol', 'credit', 'interesting', 'excellent', 'foil', 'Baltar', 'tortured', 'struggle', 'Grace', 'Park', 'admirable', 'job', 'portraying', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'who', 'Kandyse', 'McClure', 'finally', 'well-earned', 'shot', 'very', 'likeable', 'subordinate', 'eyes', 'can', 'see', 'greater', 'struggles', 'folks', 'who', 'ongoing', 'eye-candy', 'factor', 'Tahmoh', 'Penikett', 'bill', 'more', 'given', 'impossible', 'situation', 'just', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Fans', 'original', 'series', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Richard', 'Hatch', 'original', 'Apollo', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'turn', 'terrorist', 'turned', 'politician', 'How', 'very', 'apt', 'not', 'bells', 'whistles', 'series', 'tech', 'standpoint', 'so', 'many', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'late', 'paper', 'telephones', 'when', 'people', 'get', 'injured', 'stay', 'way', 'while', 'magic', 'hypo-sprays', 'low-tech', 'future', 'can', 'see', 'people', 'shine', 'darkness', 'DVD', 'sets', 'should', 'thrill', 'fans', 'series', 'being', 'packed', 'extras', 'were', 'first', 'marketed', 'online', 'early', 'episodes', 'unfolded', 'Definitely', 'must-own', 'fan', 'good', 'television']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

I feel cheated after watching season 4.5. What I thought was a Sci-fi show turned out to be a show advocating religion. Everything, I mean everything is supposed to be God's plan, a plan that has no reason or logic and cannot be questioned.Sure the Cylons spoke of their God all the time in previous seasons, but I thought those were the writers/narrators' commentary on religion, not to be taken literally. Now to my horror Season 4.5 made it clear the narrators/writers actually meant it when they spoke of god through the cylons. After season 4.5 when I revisit previous dialogues on god, they took on new meaning. And we are to believe the ""ghosts"" of Baltar and Six we saw throughout the show were literally angels, along with Starbuck. This puts a religious undertone on all previous seasons and RUINED THEM ALL for me.Then there's the obligatory bashing of technology when a writer runs out of original ideas. These liberal art majors, while reaping the rewards of advances in technology, they never understand technology, never worked for it, yet somehow they think they've got the licence to bash it.No real insight or wisdom about life or the universe.

Season 2 was split into two sections, with this DVD set containing the final 10 episodes of the 20 episode season plus a bonus episode.  Dubbed Season 2.5, it picks up with the crew of Galactica shocked at the discovery of the Battlestar Pegasus.  However, their initial excitement fades as they start to realize that Admiral Cain (Michelle Forces) is going to be a very tough new commander of the fleet.  As the newly reunited fleet faces their first incursion against the Cylons, loyalties are tested.  The season also considers the fate of President Rosalin as her cancer continues to spread and she seeks re-election as well as life aboard the various ships for the civilian fleet.Season 2.5 is solid and includes my all-time favorite BSG episode - ""Downloaded,"" in which we get to see more of the Cylon society and learn the fates of Caprica Six and Sharon Valerii.  The season ends with a shocking two-parter that completely shifts the direction of the show.  This ending is a huge risk, but I really admire BSG's willingness to defy expectations and take the show in uncomfortable directions.  I can't wait to see how this situation is resolved in Season 3.  The set also includes an expanded version of the Season 2.0 cliff-hanger (""Pegasus""), which is interesting to watch.On the other hand, Season 2.5 contains two of the weakest BSG episodes: ""Black Market"" (Lee is tasked with eliminating illegal black market activity) and ""Sacrifice"" (Lee has to intervene in a hostage situation aboard Cloud Nine).  Both episodes play like typical cop shows.  I like Lee, but these kinds of episodes make him into a boring, square-jawed hero.  On the commentaries, producer Ron Moore is refreshingly upfront with his disappointment with these two episodes.The DVD features audio commentaries for most episodes; these are primarily the podcasts that the producers created for the SyFy Channel website.  In general, these podcasts are very good, although they are more informal and of worse quality sound-wise than what one usually expects on DVD sets.  Likewise, they sometimes let spoilers slip; in particular, do not listen to the commentary for the Pegasus (expanded episode) until after you watch ""Resurrection Ship: Part 2"" as it contains a huge spoiler.",4,More terrific BSG with a few bum episodes,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,2334,"[""'m"", 'latecomer', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'am', 'just', 'now', 'watching', 'DVD', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'split', 'two', 'sections', 'DVD', 'set', 'containing', 'final', '10', 'episodes', '20', 'episode', 'season', 'bonus', 'episode', 'Dubbed', 'Season', '2.5', 'up', 'crew', 'Galactica', 'shocked', 'discovery', 'Battlestar', 'Pegasus', 'However', 'initial', 'excitement', 'fades', 'start', 'realize', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'Michelle', 'Forces', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'tough', 'new', 'commander', 'fleet', 'newly', 'reunited', 'fleet', 'first', 'incursion', 'Cylons', 'loyalties', 'are', 'tested', 'season', 'also', 'fate', 'President', 'Rosalin', 'cancer', 'spread', 're-election', 'as', 'well', 'life', 'various', 'ships', 'civilian', 'fleet.Season', '2.5', 'solid', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'BSG', 'episode', 'Downloaded', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'Cylon', 'society', 'learn', 'fates', 'Caprica', 'Six', 'Sharon', 'Valerii', 'season', 'shocking', 'two-parter', 'completely', 'shifts', 'direction', 'show', 'ending', 'huge', 'risk', 'really', 'admire', 'BSG', 'willingness', 'defy', 'expectations', 'take', 'show', 'uncomfortable', 'directions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'situation', 'resolved', 'Season', '3', 'set', 'also', 'expanded', 'version', 'Season', '2.0', 'cliff-hanger', 'Pegasus', 'interesting', 'watch.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Season', '2.5', 'contains', 'two', 'weakest', 'BSG', 'Black', 'Market', 'Lee', 'tasked', 'eliminating', 'illegal', 'black', 'market', 'activity', 'Sacrifice', 'Lee', 'intervene', 'hostage', 'situation', 'Cloud', 'Nine', 'episodes', 'play', 'typical', 'cop', 'shows', 'Lee', 'kinds', 'episodes', 'make', 'boring', 'square-jawed', 'hero', 'commentaries', 'producer', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'refreshingly', 'upfront', 'disappointment', 'two', 'episodes.The', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'primarily', 'podcasts', 'producers', 'created', 'SyFy', 'Channel', 'website', 'general', 'podcasts', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'more', 'informal', 'worse', 'quality', 'sound-wise', 'what', 'one', 'usually', 'DVD', 'sets', 'Likewise', 'sometimes', 'let', 'spoilers', 'slip', 'particular', 'do', 'not', 'listen', 'commentary', 'Pegasus', 'expanded', 'episode', 'watch', 'Resurrection', 'Ship', 'Part', '2', 'huge', 'spoiler']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)

She did what to keep the Pegasus going? And Adama doesn't mention to Roselyn that maybe they should interview some of the Pegasus crew to see if what was said was true? But, then, Roselynn did leave that little girl on that one ship to die way back at the start of the series because, well, just because.What's interesting is how they only hint at what Cain has done. And then when she tells her XO not to do what she sent him to Galactica to do, it is at this point that you almost accept her as part of the team. But then you watch Razor, and about halfway through you realize that she should have been pushed out an airlock.If you don't get what I am saying, or just don't get hung up on such stuff, enjoy the show.

Saw the original series as a teenager, trust me, it doesn't even hold a CANDLE to the new version. In fact, the new BSG even puts the later Star Trek series, Voyager and Enterprise, to utter and complete shame (though not NextGen or DS9 during their best years), not to mention Stargate SG Anything. The best sci-fi on television right now, period? Yep, without a doubt.That said, asking $50 ($35 at Amazon) for a half-season set is too much, which is why I give this product only 3 stars (quality-wise, its 5 stars all the way). A quick an' easy way around this if you're not a video quality freak is to simply DOWNLOAD the ten Season 2 episodes from iTUNES at $1.99 a pop, $19.90 total, courtesy of NBC's recent deal with Apple.Yes, the resolution on the downloaded episodes is not great (320x240) since they were designed to be used with the video iPod and its small screen. Viewing them full screen on my laptop, well, they're VHS quality at best. And you don't get any extras or deleted scenes (not that the low-featured half-season set has a lot of those).But you DO get the episodes for around HALF the price of what they're asking for the half-season DVD set. And best of all, you can get 'em right NOW, no waiting (unless you're unfortunate enough to still be on dialup, lol).Even if you don't particularly like the low-res quality of the downloads, it might be just the thing to tide you over until the full Season 2 set becomes available in a few months, with its no-doubt better set of extras and features than the overpriced, under-featured half season set.(Note: I would have absolutely NOTHING against the half-season set, if only it were priced appropriately for a HALF season set. Something more like $39 retail, $29 at Amazon would be fair.)PS-  Since I wrote this review, Amazon has dropped the price to $32... close to a fair price for what you're getting, in my estimation.

Amazingly, this second half of Season Two fulfilled all those empty areas!I had pined for more overall drama, and the early-episodes story arc of this set (involving the Pegasus) provides that in spades.I had wanted better character development and that improved as well, focusing on the two Adamas, Laura Roslin, and Starbuck.Mainly, though, I was really waiting for more background information on the Cylons and their potential future relations with humans.  Well, the final three episodes of this season focus specifically on those issues and provide easily the best drama of the entire series to date.Actually, the final episode is so startling and different from anything previous that it was a complete shock (albeit in a good way) to my system.  It really invigorates a show that needed to be shook up a bit.Thus, more than at any other point in this show so far, I am re-charged and ready for the third season, hoping that it will continue to break new ground in challenging viewers on a deeper level.",5,This Changes Everything,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,1133,"['first', 'season', 'half', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'kept', 'wanting', 'more', 'show', 'number', 'different', 'areas', 'Amazingly', 'second', 'half', 'Season', 'Two', 'fulfilled', 'empty', 'areas', 'had', 'pined', 'more', 'overall', 'drama', 'early-episodes', 'story', 'arc', 'set', 'involving', 'Pegasus', 'spades.I', 'had', 'wanted', 'better', 'character', 'development', 'improved', 'as', 'well', 'focusing', 'two', 'Adamas', 'Laura', 'Roslin', 'Starbuck.Mainly', 'was', 'really', 'waiting', 'more', 'background', 'information', 'Cylons', 'potential', 'future', 'relations', 'humans', 'Well', 'final', 'three', 'episodes', 'season', 'focus', 'specifically', 'issues', 'provide', 'easily', 'best', 'drama', 'entire', 'series', 'date.Actually', 'final', 'episode', 'so', 'startling', 'different', 'anything', 'previous', 'was', 'complete', 'shock', 'good', 'way', 'system', 'really', 'show', 'needed', 'be', 'shook', 'up', 'bit.Thus', 'more', 'other', 'point', 'show', 'so', 'far', 'am', 're-charged', 'ready', 'third', 'season', 'hoping', 'will', 'continue', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'challenging', 'viewers', 'deeper', 'level']",Battlestar Galactica: Season 2 (Episodes 1-10)
