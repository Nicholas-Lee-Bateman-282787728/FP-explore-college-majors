1407693,AWA88F5TOX8VL,B004H0M34A,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[21, 23]","(1974 - Italian with English subtitles / optional dubbed English audio). Finally in a Region 1 / NTSC release, it's time to toss out the old wretched copies of this much-lauded and impossible to find gaillo, comfortably sit back and enjoy this classy retro-artifact by director/writer Francesco Barilli (who also penned 1972's 'Who Saw Her Die?').Starring Mimsy Farmer ('4 Flies On Grey Velvet','Autopsy','More'), who portrays a chemist as well as a psychologically fragile main character who finds herself sinking slowly into a kaleidoscope of hallucinations and past nightmares - or are they?  Are these disturbing visions of her childhood with her mother just sediments of a past that are now being subconsciously re-evaluated, or do they conceal some dark machination of a trauma she once suffered and buried? The slow progression from successful scientist to a disturbed woman on the edge of insanity details the in-depth intricacies of the haunted mind, one that weaves fantasy, reality and memory into one seamless fabric. With a cast of interesting characters (especially Mario Scaccia, who stands out as the eccentric elderly next door neighbor) and threads of murder, black magic, blind psychics, flesh-eating, Alice in Wonderland and 'Rosemary's Baby' all tossed into a salad of sanguinary psychosis, all fans of gailli, cult and Eurohorror should stay well-entertained.Unlike most gailli, there's no real sleaze involved (nudity, yes, that's a given in European films from the 70's, but it's there as part of the plot and not random titillation); this one's more of an arthouse/horror hybrid than most - the sets are gorgeous, the cinematography wondrous to behold, the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful, the director's eye is awash in artistry (Barilli was first a painter before becoming a writer and director) and the digital transfer of this RaroVideo release is absolutely glowing. Colors are rich and vibrant, contrasts are deep, and audio is crisp. (I hope they continue to release Euro-artifacts from their PAL vaults in NTSC for the rest of us to enjoy). Special features include the documentary 'Portrait in Black', the director's bio and filmography, and a small booklet.4 solid stars for both the flick and the print we're treated to - take a whiff of 'The Perfume of the Lady in Black'.",4,The 'Scent of a Woman'(s) Psychosis...,1301270400,"03 28, 2011",2011,2312,"['1974', 'Italian', 'English', 'subtitles', '/', 'optional', 'dubbed', 'English', 'audio', 'Finally', 'Region', '1', '/', 'NTSC', 'release', 'time', 'toss', 'out', 'old', 'wretched', 'copies', 'much-lauded', 'impossible', 'find', 'gaillo', 'comfortably', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'classy', 'retro-artifact', 'director/writer', 'Francesco', 'Barilli', 'who', 'also', 'penned', '1972', ""'Who"", 'Saw', 'Her', 'Die', '.Starring', 'Mimsy', 'Farmer', '4', 'Flies', 'Grey', 'Velvet', ""'Autopsy"", 'who', 'chemist', 'as', 'well', 'psychologically', 'fragile', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'sinking', 'slowly', 'kaleidoscope', 'hallucinations', 'past', 'nightmares', 'are', 'Are', 'disturbing', 'visions', 'childhood', 'mother', 'just', 'sediments', 'past', 'are', 'now', 'being', 'subconsciously', 're-evaluated', 'do', 'conceal', 'dark', 'machination', 'trauma', 'once', 'suffered', 'buried', 'slow', 'progression', 'successful', 'scientist', 'disturbed', 'woman', 'edge', 'insanity', 'details', 'in-depth', 'intricacies', 'haunted', 'mind', 'one', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'memory', 'one', 'seamless', 'fabric', 'cast', 'interesting', 'characters', 'especially', 'Mario', 'Scaccia', 'who', 'out', 'eccentric', 'elderly', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'threads', 'murder', 'black', 'magic', 'psychics', 'flesh-eating', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', ""'Rosemary"", 'Baby', 'tossed', 'salad', 'sanguinary', 'psychosis', 'fans', 'gailli', 'cult', 'Eurohorror', 'should', 'stay', 'well-entertained.Unlike', 'most', 'gailli', 'real', 'sleaze', 'involved', 'nudity', 'yes', 'given', 'European', 'films', '70', 'there', 'part', 'plot', 'not', 'random', 'titillation', 'one', 'more', 'arthouse/horror', 'hybrid', 'most', 'sets', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'wondrous', 'behold', 'soundtrack', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'director', 'eye', 'awash', 'artistry', 'Barilli', 'was', 'first', 'painter', 'becoming', 'writer', 'director', 'digital', 'transfer', 'RaroVideo', 'release', 'absolutely', 'glowing', 'Colors', 'are', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'contrasts', 'are', 'deep', 'audio', 'crisp', 'hope', 'continue', 'release', 'Euro-artifacts', 'PAL', 'vaults', 'NTSC', 'rest', 'enjoy', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'documentary', ""'Portrait"", 'Black', 'director', 'bio', 'filmography', 'small', 'booklet.4', 'solid', 'stars', 'flick', 'print', ""'re"", 'treated', 'take', 'whiff', ""'The"", 'Perfume', 'Lady', 'Black']",N/A
1407694,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B004H0M34A,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[5, 5]","Although most of the reviews for this film seem to rave about it, I can't be so positive. ""Perfume of a Lady in Black"" is dressed up as a giallo (the title alone is typical), but it doesn't seem to fit into that genre very comfortable. Basically the tale of a woman who is slowly going insane, the film echoes other films in several ways, so you could compare it to ""Rosemary's Baby"", as it features a woman in an apartment block with strange neighbours and a boyfriend who isn't much help, ""Images"", which features a similar case of the central character seeing phantoms and hallucinations, and ""The Haunting of Julia"", which also features a heroine tortured by guilt because of a past tragedy in her family. So with all these comparisons, I guess I was feeling that not much in this movie was original...the litle ghost blonde girl in a white party dress has REALLY been done to death.I also found the film very fragmented, with scenes just cut together with no flow or sense of progression: you couldn't tell if a change of shot meant another view of the same action or the passing of time. Some of the imagery is very nice, and Mimsy Farmer looks good, but it was like watching a film that was all montage and no real progression.The acting is also pretty lame. I've always found Mimsy Farmer a bit unfathomable, but she is the best actor here, it's the rest of them that let things down, Mimsy's boyfriend is terribly wooden, as are all the neighbours and supporting cast. Doesn't add any mystery when you don't know if behaviour is supposed to be weird or if it's just not been acted properly! The crappy dubbing doesn't help and as usual I could recognise the voices of the post production dubbing cast, as they seem to use the same people over and over again in any number of Italian movies from the 70s and 80sWhat really confused me was the ending - after 90 minutes of spooky drifting mindplay, the film suddenly delivers 3 minutes of unexpected gore that seems to bear no relation to anything else in the film. I have to say I was pretty furious as I watched this final scene as I felt it was completely the wrong payoff for the attention I had paid to what proceeded it, and it leaves a whole host of unanswered questions.I honestly would not say this was a rediscovered gem, although the picture quality is very good, and there were some nice shots, the end result is unsatisfying.",3,Strange but not in a good way,1338508800,"06 1, 2012",2012,2395,"['most', 'reviews', 'film', 'seem', 'rave', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'positive', 'Perfume', 'Lady', 'Black', 'dressed', 'up', 'giallo', 'title', 'alone', 'typical', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'genre', 'very', 'comfortable', 'Basically', 'tale', 'woman', 'who', 'slowly', 'going', 'insane', 'film', 'other', 'films', 'several', 'ways', 'could', 'compare', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'woman', 'apartment', 'block', 'strange', 'neighbours', 'boyfriend', 'who', ""n't"", 'much', 'help', 'Images', 'similar', 'case', 'central', 'character', 'seeing', 'phantoms', 'hallucinations', 'Haunting', 'Julia', 'also', 'heroine', 'tortured', 'guilt', 'past', 'tragedy', 'family', 'So', 'comparisons', 'guess', 'was', 'feeling', 'not', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'original', 'litle', 'ghost', 'blonde', 'girl', 'white', 'party', 'dress', 'REALLY', 'been', 'done', 'death.I', 'also', 'found', 'film', 'very', 'fragmented', 'scenes', 'just', 'cut', 'together', 'flow', 'sense', 'progression', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'change', 'shot', 'meant', 'view', 'same', 'action', 'passing', 'time', 'imagery', 'very', 'nice', 'Mimsy', 'Farmer', 'good', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'montage', 'real', 'progression.The', 'acting', 'also', 'pretty', 'lame', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'Mimsy', 'Farmer', 'bit', 'unfathomable', 'best', 'actor', 'here', 'rest', 'let', 'things', 'down', 'Mimsy', 'boyfriend', 'terribly', 'wooden', 'are', 'neighbours', 'supporting', 'cast', ""n't"", 'add', 'mystery', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'behaviour', 'supposed', 'be', 'weird', 'just', 'not', 'been', 'acted', 'properly', 'crappy', 'dubbing', ""n't"", 'help', 'usual', 'could', 'recognise', 'voices', 'post', 'production', 'dubbing', 'cast', 'seem', 'use', 'same', 'people', 'over', 'again', 'number', 'Italian', 'movies', '70s', '80sWhat', 'really', 'confused', 'was', 'ending', '90', 'minutes', 'spooky', 'drifting', 'mindplay', 'film', 'suddenly', '3', 'minutes', 'unexpected', 'gore', 'bear', 'relation', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'pretty', 'furious', 'watched', 'final', 'scene', 'felt', 'was', 'completely', 'wrong', 'payoff', 'attention', 'had', 'paid', 'what', 'proceeded', 'whole', 'host', 'unanswered', 'questions.I', 'honestly', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'rediscovered', 'gem', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'were', 'nice', 'shots', 'end', 'result', 'unsatisfying']",N/A

1407697,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,B004H0M34A,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[1, 1]","If you've ever listened to a small child try and tell a lengthy joke, then you're probably familiar with how needlessly complicated the joke becomes before dissolving into complete nonsense and an outrageous punchline.  &#34;The Perfume of the Lady in Black&#34; is just such an undertaking, a creative, convoluted joke that slaps the viewer over the head with a grotesquely miscalculated punchline that seems stolen from a Lucio Fulci movie.  First-time director, Francesco Barilli (a former painter), has an eye for detail and infuses &#34;Perfume&#34; with scenes of languid glamour and creeping menace; his visual style is well-served by this lovely Raro Video restoration (which accounts for one of the two stars I awarded to this film).Actress Mimsy Farmer plays Sylvia, an alleged chemist who spends most of the film calling in sick to work.  Sylvia has violent secrets in her past that seem to be resurfacing in dreams and hallucinations.  Concurrently, literally everyone who Sylvia comes into contact with--friends, neighbors, lover, co-workers, the local taxidermist--seems to be harboring some shady secret of their own as they slink around the colorful sets, whispering together, nodding knowingly as they head for midnight assignations in some crumbling ruin.  Soon enough, Syvia is on the verge of full-fledged psychosis.  Or is she?  Do the wealthy voodoo experts know something they're not telling, or are they, too, part of Sylvia's madness.  By the time the movie arrives at its unlikely and gruesome finale, I'd stopped caring.  More a horror story than a giallo, &#34;Perfume&#34; ends on an incoherent note that offers no satisfaction; in fact, many viewers will either probably find themselves laughing (though not in a good way) at the filmmaker's audacity, or angrily simmering to see their patience so deliriously and contemptuously disregarded.As an actress, Farmer often played vulnerable, neurotic beauties whose classy fragility belied a hidden physicality that unexpectedly surfaced in scenes of surprising carnality and violence.  Blonde and ethereal, Farmer carries the film (as much as she can) with a convincing aura of tortured intellect, sadness and impending doom.  The film gets another star for her performance.  Unfortunately, her co-stars don't help her out much.  Mario Scaccia, as an eccentric, initially helpful neighbor, looks more like a mad scientist than Farmer, who is, literally, the mad scientist of the story, and Mauricio Bonuglia, as Farmer's lover, seems to struggle with a character that is poorly conceived.  The ghostly little girl played by Daniela Barnes, is also ill-conceived, given the direction that the movie takes.  The rest of the cast, although they appear and re-appear, like phantoms, throughout the film, are more memorable as a whole, than for any single character anyone plays.Visually, &#34;The Perfume of the Lady in Black&#34; is a strikingly stylish example of a particular period in Italian filmmaking.  Unfortunately, the lesser elements of that same filmmaking style ruin what could have been a fine classic.",2,"""A Woman on the Verge of An Explanation for this Film""",1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,3089,"[""'ve"", 'ever', 'listened', 'small', 'child', 'try', 'tell', 'lengthy', 'joke', 'then', ""'re"", 'probably', 'familiar', 'how', 'needlessly', 'complicated', 'joke', 'dissolving', 'complete', 'nonsense', 'outrageous', 'punchline', '34', 'Perfume', 'Lady', 'Black', '34', 'just', 'such', 'undertaking', 'creative', 'convoluted', 'joke', 'viewer', 'head', 'grotesquely', 'miscalculated', 'punchline', 'stolen', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'movie', 'First-time', 'director', 'Francesco', 'Barilli', 'former', 'painter', 'eye', 'detail', '34', 'Perfume', '34', 'scenes', 'languid', 'glamour', 'creeping', 'menace', 'visual', 'style', 'well-served', 'lovely', 'Raro', 'Video', 'restoration', 'one', 'two', 'stars', 'awarded', 'film', '.Actress', 'Mimsy', 'Farmer', 'Sylvia', 'alleged', 'chemist', 'who', 'most', 'film', 'calling', 'sick', 'work', 'Sylvia', 'violent', 'secrets', 'past', 'seem', 'be', 'resurfacing', 'dreams', 'hallucinations', 'Concurrently', 'literally', 'everyone', 'who', 'Sylvia', 'contact', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'lover', 'co-workers', 'local', 'taxidermist', 'be', 'harboring', 'shady', 'secret', 'own', 'slink', 'colorful', 'sets', 'whispering', 'together', 'nodding', 'knowingly', 'head', 'midnight', 'assignations', 'crumbling', 'ruin', 'Soon', 'enough', 'Syvia', 'verge', 'full-fledged', 'psychosis', 'Do', 'wealthy', 'voodoo', 'experts', 'know', 'something', ""'re"", 'not', 'telling', 'are', 'too', 'part', 'Sylvia', 'madness', 'time', 'movie', 'unlikely', 'gruesome', 'finale', ""'d"", 'stopped', 'caring', 'More', 'horror', 'story', 'giallo', '34', 'Perfume', '34', 'ends', 'incoherent', 'note', 'satisfaction', 'fact', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'either', 'probably', 'find', 'laughing', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'filmmaker', 'audacity', 'angrily', 'simmering', 'see', 'patience', 'so', 'deliriously', 'contemptuously', 'disregarded.As', 'actress', 'Farmer', 'often', 'played', 'vulnerable', 'neurotic', 'beauties', 'classy', 'fragility', 'belied', 'hidden', 'physicality', 'unexpectedly', 'surfaced', 'scenes', 'surprising', 'carnality', 'violence', 'Blonde', 'ethereal', 'Farmer', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'convincing', 'aura', 'tortured', 'intellect', 'sadness', 'impending', 'doom', 'film', 'star', 'performance', 'Unfortunately', 'co-stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'her', 'out', 'much', 'Mario', 'Scaccia', 'eccentric', 'initially', 'helpful', 'neighbor', 'more', 'mad', 'scientist', 'Farmer', 'who', 'literally', 'mad', 'scientist', 'story', 'Mauricio', 'Bonuglia', 'Farmer', 'lover', 'struggle', 'character', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'ghostly', 'little', 'girl', 'played', 'Daniela', 'Barnes', 'also', 'ill-conceived', 'given', 'direction', 'movie', 'rest', 'cast', 'appear', 're-appear', 'phantoms', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'memorable', 'whole', 'single', 'character', 'anyone', 'plays.Visually', '34', 'Perfume', 'Lady', 'Black', '34', 'strikingly', 'stylish', 'example', 'particular', 'period', 'Italian', 'filmmaking', 'Unfortunately', 'lesser', 'elements', 'same', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'ruin', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'classic']",N/A

The story revolts around a woman that begins to have flash backs from her very sad childhood, as his father (a sailor) was most time away from home, until she realizes her mother intimate with other men. In my opinion, this part takes place half of the movie is the best achieved in my view, with a nice style that some reviewers may fin slow. This part leads to more explicit hallucinations of herself as a child coming to see her in present time. Meanwhile, we have some sort of sect that is helping on this process to drive her mad. These two parts may be considered a sad with mystery film. Near the end, we see murders in pure Giallo style, and a quite unexpected ending, yet dumb for most I would say.

The music by Nicola Piovani is quite good, the cinematography by Mario Masini and editing by Enzo Micarelli are excellent and it is well complemented by RaroVideo's quality transfer and pressing.  But Barilli, who takes major credit for most of the plot ingredients,and however, stunning the ending, the traveling to this shock ending, adds little to make it seem ultimately gratuitous, and as a study of madness, explains nothing.  Mimsy Farmer is excellent, deserving of her fame in European cinema, as she is asked to carry the picture, which she nearly does, but the mystery surrounding her madness remains without any real language to the audience.  It is true the film never delivers as a true giallo, although there is some blatant working a cleaver by Ms. Farmer toward the end, but I must confer that it is a cult film.
