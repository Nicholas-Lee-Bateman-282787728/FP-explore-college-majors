A Slezak ""Incredulous Reader""","[2, 3]",In this movie if you want to see Kari Wuhrer naked you will see that but if you are looking for some kind of plot it is lacking there.  The guy in this movie is so one dimensional that you don't think he ever got out of the sixth grade.  I think this movie would need a lot of work if you wanted to have a plot.  They just sit in their apartment and throw paint on each other.  I was dissapointed by this one the sex scene were not even that erotic.,2,Naked girl,1249344000,"08 4, 2009",2009,449,"['movie', 'want', 'see', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'naked', 'will', 'see', 'are', 'looking', 'kind', 'plot', 'lacking', 'there', 'guy', 'movie', 'so', 'one', 'dimensional', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'got', 'sixth', 'grade', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'need', 'lot', 'work', 'wanted', 'have', 'plot', 'just', 'sit', 'apartment', 'throw', 'paint', 'other', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'one', 'sex', 'scene', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'erotic']",Luscious - Unrated VHS

Kari gives a strong performance  through out the whole film. She in fact carries much of the film. The guy  tries to play the tortured artist, but ends up like Micheal on La Femme  Nikita. There is a subtle plot through out that shows much about creativity  and its source and how dependent an artist is on his or her  &quot;muse&quot;.  I am also male, and there was no body double for Kari.  Her nude scenes, which there where a lot of, were tastefully and erotically  done.

472024,A3L2U581LL17EB,6305656401,Eric,"[28, 30]","I'm feeling a little kind today.  So much so that I'm giving this film a slightly higher rating than it really deserves.  That, and the fact that it stars Kari Wuhrer, a drop-dead gorgeous actress/singer who has the uncanny ability to brighten most movies she's in.  So it's without surprise she happens to be the only bright spot in this otherwise awful drama about a painter who has, uh, painter's block.This painter's played by Stephen Shellen, who has the uncanny  ability to annoy and sound like he wants to be intentionally annoying even when he doesn't really mean to.  It sure as heck doesn't help his character is written as a ""confused"" individual, basically meaning he's a complete psycho.  That's right, he tears up paintings when he has no artistic inspiration, he refuses to have sex with girlfriend Kari (that's the biggest no, no), and has some incredibly hilarious speeches about how there can be depth and meaning found in desiring a cupcake.This painter eventually finds inspiration by rolling paint over both his and his girlfriend's bodies, then making love on top of some paper.  The act looks pretty nasty, and the movie doesn't make it seem much more erotic, even with Kari Wuhrer involved (meaning if she can't make this look sexy, then someone like Chasey Lain would still probably only be marginally more successful).Kari Wuhrer happens to deliver the movie's only decent performance (and with three people total, that can't help very much), evoking sympathy as the girlfriend who has to stomach this painter's attitude.  She also happens to show a LOT of nudity, always a plus, but unfortunately, only three of these scenes happen to not involve paint (but three good nude scenes from Wuhrer make this into a somewhat bearable watch).This movie's pretty much your typical case of artist who find his inspiration from the most unexpected place, but lacks the benefit of good direction and writing, (mostly) good acting, and even a good soundtrack, which is so grating you'll want to turn the sound off. By the end, you find out nothing of importance has happened, except that Kari discovers she can paint rather well. If you're a Kari Wuhrer fan, then this MIGHT be worth watching for a dollar, but no more.  Without her, my rating for this film would plummet like a rock....",2,Saved from total garbage by Kari Wuhrer.,1032566400,"09 21, 2002",2002,2302,"[""'m"", 'feeling', 'little', 'kind', 'today', 'So', 'much', ""'m"", 'giving', 'film', 'slightly', 'higher', 'rating', 'really', 'fact', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'actress/singer', 'who', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'brighten', 'most', 'movies', 'surprise', 'be', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'otherwise', 'awful', 'drama', 'painter', 'who', 'uh', 'painter', 'block.This', 'painter', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Shellen', 'who', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'annoy', 'sound', 'be', 'intentionally', 'annoying', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'really', 'mean', 'sure', 'heck', ""n't"", 'help', 'character', 'written', 'confused', 'individual', 'basically', 'meaning', 'complete', 'psycho', 'right', 'up', 'paintings', 'when', 'artistic', 'inspiration', 'have', 'sex', 'girlfriend', 'Kari', 'biggest', 'incredibly', 'hilarious', 'speeches', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'depth', 'meaning', 'found', 'desiring', 'cupcake.This', 'painter', 'eventually', 'inspiration', 'rolling', 'paint', 'girlfriend', 'bodies', 'then', 'making', 'love', 'top', 'paper', 'act', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'erotic', 'even', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'involved', 'meaning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'look', 'sexy', 'then', 'someone', 'Chasey', 'Lain', 'would', 'still', 'probably', 'only', 'be', 'marginally', 'more', 'successful', '.Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'deliver', 'movie', 'only', 'decent', 'performance', 'three', 'people', 'total', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'very', 'much', 'evoking', 'sympathy', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'stomach', 'painter', 'attitude', 'also', 'show', 'LOT', 'nudity', 'always', 'plus', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'three', 'scenes', 'happen', 'not', 'involve', 'paint', 'three', 'good', 'nude', 'scenes', 'Wuhrer', 'make', 'somewhat', 'bearable', 'watch', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'typical', 'case', 'artist', 'who', 'find', 'inspiration', 'most', 'unexpected', 'place', 'benefit', 'good', 'direction', 'writing', 'mostly', 'good', 'acting', 'even', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'so', 'grating', ""'ll"", 'want', 'turn', 'sound', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'nothing', 'importance', 'happened', 'Kari', 'can', 'paint', 'rather', 'well', ""'re"", 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'fan', 'then', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'dollar', 'more', 'rating', 'film', 'would', 'plummet', 'rock']",Luscious - Unrated VHS

I've had artist's block, as he does,in both painting and writing, and haven't all artists? Indeed, I have it now. I was asked to make a poster for a band, so I submitted several sketches to the leader of it, and he and I chose one to pursue. I painted the clothing we decided was best, but I can't get in the mood to paint the faces of the four men in the band. If Kari Wuhrer (a.k.a. Kari Salin) was with me, she might help me to break through the block. I did finish typing and illustrating a book yesterday, so I'm not blocked on it. Perhaps I'll just watch ""Luscious"", ""Spider's Web"" and other movies of Kari's and maybe paint her. I paint realistically, but if Kari wanted me to pour paint upon her nude body, as in the movie, I'd be willing to try some abstract painting. ""Luscious"" is a great name for her! Seeing her nude several times makes this movie worthwhile. I'm not a big fan of Steve Shellen, but with a nude Kari Wuhrer so often seen, who notices the man with her? Steve is better than the man in ""Spider's Web"". I can't even recall his name, for Kari made me not even see him. The story of ""Luscious"" is OK as movies about artists go ... and that makes it far ahead of ""Art School Confidential"". I advise everyone to buy this movie.
