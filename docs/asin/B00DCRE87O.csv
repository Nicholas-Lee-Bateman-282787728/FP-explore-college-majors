1655243,A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,B00DCRE87O,Darren O'Neill,"[3, 3]","Jim Caviezel lets loose here in &#34;Savannah,&#34; embracing the bigger than life persona of Ward Allen, an Oxford educated man who decided to forgo his inheritance in favor of a much simpler life as a hunter and outdoors man.  He spends his days with his friend and former slave Christmas Moultrie on the river hunting for ducks, which is the only place he feels at home.Off the river, Allen has a hard time with the stuffed shirts who view him as an oddity.  He often runs into trouble with the law for bringing in more than the &#34;legal&#34; amount of foul and is usually let off the hook by an understanding judge who is amused by his wit and passion.  His wife, who comes from a wealthy family, falls for his over the top personality then has trouble with it once they are married.The story jumps back and forth in time using flashbacks, which I think took a bit away from the flow of the movie.  In the end though it is still a nice departure from a lot of the movies being made today.  It's nice to see a movie that can tell a story without computer generated graphics and car chases.  I'd highly recommend &#34;Savannah&#34; to anyone who loves a good story.",5,Jim Caviezel Brings Ward Allen To Life,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,1169,"['Jim', 'Caviezel', 'loose', 'here', '34', 'Savannah', '34', 'embracing', 'bigger', 'life', 'persona', 'Ward', 'Allen', 'Oxford', 'educated', 'man', 'who', 'decided', 'forgo', 'inheritance', 'favor', 'much', 'simpler', 'life', 'hunter', 'outdoors', 'man', 'days', 'friend', 'former', 'slave', 'Christmas', 'Moultrie', 'river', 'hunting', 'ducks', 'only', 'place', 'river', 'Allen', 'hard', 'time', 'stuffed', 'shirts', 'who', 'view', 'oddity', 'often', 'trouble', 'law', 'bringing', 'more', '34', 'legal', '34', 'amount', 'foul', 'usually', 'let', 'off', 'hook', 'understanding', 'judge', 'who', 'amused', 'wit', 'passion', 'wife', 'who', 'wealthy', 'family', 'top', 'personality', 'then', 'trouble', 'once', 'are', 'married.The', 'story', 'jumps', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'using', 'flashbacks', 'think', 'took', 'bit', 'away', 'flow', 'movie', 'end', 'still', 'nice', 'departure', 'lot', 'movies', 'being', 'made', 'today', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'can', 'tell', 'story', 'computer', 'generated', 'graphics', 'car', 'chases', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', '34', 'Savannah', '34', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'story']",Savannah

1655245,A17KFBGZDAFMZ6,B00DCRE87O,Jason Garrett,"[2, 2]","A gentle, sweeping tale brought to life by an ensemble known for its performances more than its celebrity, Savannah presents the story of Ward Allen. Jim Caviezel turns in one of his strongest leading performances, genuinely seeming to have fun in the role of a larger than life Southern gent. Chiwetel Ejiofor, one of filmmaking's most underrated talents, is strong and steady in the role of Ward's sidekick, Christmas, aka &#34;The Mayor&#34; of Savannah. Their friendship is strengthened by their differences and the chemistry between the two actors was very credible and intriguing.I had not been as much of a fan of Jaimie Alexander's work, yet I found myself appreciating her in this film. In terms of emotion, her character runs the gamut and it was refreshing to see her taking on a role of this nature as opposed to the numerous action-roles to her credit. At times she was remarkably haunting, which made her character even more watchable. Veterans like Hal Holbrook and Sam Shepherd pepper scenes with enough familiarity to keep the sometimes meandering story moving forward. This is a Southern tale, but one of great respect and humility. It neither boasts nor laments its place in history; rather, it simply carries the burden of the past as it attempts to make a new future.Most interesting, to me, was the role Bradley Whitford portrayed. I hadn't made the connection until the end but I'm sure a keen moviegoer will admire the part he plays in the overall tale. The mystery of the story was particularly intriguing and, as may have been the point, inspires one to learn more about the true lives of these characters.Definitely recommended.",5,Subtly surprising...,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,1655,"['gentle', 'sweeping', 'tale', 'brought', 'life', 'ensemble', 'known', 'performances', 'more', 'celebrity', 'Savannah', 'story', 'Ward', 'Allen', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'one', 'strongest', 'leading', 'performances', 'genuinely', 'seeming', 'have', 'fun', 'role', 'larger', 'life', 'Southern', 'gent', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'one', 'filmmaking', 'most', 'underrated', 'talents', 'strong', 'steady', 'role', 'Ward', 'sidekick', 'Christmas', 'aka', '34', 'Mayor', '34', 'Savannah', 'friendship', 'strengthened', 'differences', 'chemistry', 'two', 'actors', 'was', 'very', 'credible', 'intriguing.I', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'much', 'fan', 'Jaimie', 'Alexander', 'work', 'yet', 'found', 'appreciating', 'film', 'terms', 'emotion', 'character', 'gamut', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'taking', 'role', 'nature', 'opposed', 'numerous', 'action-roles', 'credit', 'times', 'was', 'remarkably', 'haunting', 'made', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'watchable', 'Veterans', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Sam', 'Shepherd', 'scenes', 'enough', 'familiarity', 'keep', 'sometimes', 'meandering', 'story', 'moving', 'forward', 'Southern', 'tale', 'one', 'great', 'respect', 'humility', 'boasts', 'place', 'history', 'rather', 'simply', 'burden', 'past', 'make', 'new', 'future.Most', 'interesting', 'was', 'role', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'portrayed', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'connection', 'end', ""'m"", 'sure', 'keen', 'moviegoer', 'will', 'admire', 'part', 'overall', 'tale', 'mystery', 'story', 'was', 'particularly', 'intriguing', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'point', 'one', 'learn', 'more', 'true', 'lives', 'characters.Definitely', 'recommended']",Savannah

1655248,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B00DCRE87O,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[23, 26]","Actor Jim Caviezel was the name that grabbed my attention and convinced me to pay to watch this movie when it appeared in the on demand menu of my television. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Sam Shepard and Hal Holbrook also had roles in this film. I viewed it on August 1 , 2013 even though I wasn't expecting it to be available yet.The film, based on true events, focuses on the true story of Ward Allen, a highly educated man who turned his back on conventional life - and his inheritance - to live freely on the Savannah River, hunting ducks and avoiding many of the ""rules"" of so-called polite society. He is accompanied by his long time friend, Christmas Moultrie (Chiwetel Ejiofor).Ward isn't afraid to offend those who try to get in his way, from government officials to the elite who think that duck hunting is a light diversion.His honest and open manner attracts the attention of a society woman, Lucy (Jaimie Alexander). She is equally out-spoken, somewhat impetuous, and willing to take risks. .There were many sweet and charming moments in this film. But I have to admit it didn't wholly engage me. While Sam Shepard was in fine form, Caviezel didn't seem convincing as Ward Allen. I also didn't buy the love relationship between him and Lucy. There didn't seem to be enough chemistry there..The film did make me want to know more about Ward Allen. Much of the movie is based on the research of John Cay and John Cay Jr. There are two editions of a book,  Ward Allen: Savannah River Market Hunter, one written by John Cay (1958) and the other with the author listed as John Cay Jr. (1959). I also discovered that Christmas Moultrie, Allen's companion on the river, was born a slave in 1859 (on Christmas Day) and died in April of 1957. I've heard that he had an autobiography out there but haven't found further information about that. The Georgia Historical Society lists an article, ""Ducks, Dogs, and Friends"" in its archives, in a folder which also contains a photo of Christmas Moultrie.

Chiwetal Ejiofor was excellent as Moultry and the interplay of the two men was incredible.  The scenery was breathtaking!  The editing was horrible.  This had the earmarks of a really fine movie if the editing had been better.  It was often hard to follow time progression.  For instance, Ward Allen (Jim Caviezel) is making love to his future wife, in the next scene marrying her,then she is pregnant...but how much time passes between these incidents seems unclear.  Later when Ward's wife becomes ill and Ward sells everything to take care of her, there seems to be a break down again in time between her hospitalization and his death.  I really looked forward to this movie being released when I read the background story some months ago.

1655252,A2TY359PR45ATP,B00DCRE87O,"R. Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[4, 4]","This is the true story of Ward Allen, a romantic and a highly educated man who rejected his plantation heritage for the freedom of life on a river. During the years after the turn of the last century, he teams up with an ex-slave and friend, Christmas Moultrie, to hunt ducks for a living on the Savannah River marshes. These were days when market hunting was legal and hunters could scratch out a living selling ducks to restaurants. Having duck hunted for most of my life and having come from a family of duck hunters, including a grandfather who was a market hunter, this film - which treats duck hunting much the same way &#34;A River Runs Through It&#34; treats fly fishing - was special to me. Starring one of my favorite actors, Jim Caviezel, as Ward Allen; Chiwetel Ejiofor, as Christmas Moultrie; and Jaimie Alexander, as Allen's wife, Lucy, the performances are all superb. The cinematography along the Savannah River marshes is breathtaking; and the music score, especially the use of old black spirituals, perfectly sets the mood.
