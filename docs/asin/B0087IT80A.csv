1547508,A37YM0WP2BWIYE,B0087IT80A,BobSound,"[14, 19]","What more can be said about this film that hasn't already been said here?  Both the ""King"" and ""Queen"" of Versailles seem like perfectly nice and well meaning folks, but the film is a perfect example of how the super rich deceive themselves.  They say, ""Tax us at a lower rate than everyone else, and we will use all that extra money to create jobs"".  Really?I'm sure they all have the best of intentions (and I'm being generous), but in the real world it never works out that way.  The jobs created are mostly minimum wage jobs, after all, they wouldn't even pay their personal nanny enough to visit her kids back in the Philippines once in 15 years.Mr. Siegel seems really sincere and I have no doubt he really believes he is doing good and helping people.  But just like everyone in the top 1%, the super rich have no clue what the real world is about and the suffering most people have to go through each and every day just to get by.Case in point, Mr. Siegel needs to make an $11.8 million payment to the bank for a property he owns but doesn't have the money.  He tries to make a deal, but the bank won't budge.  So he engineers a third party to buy the loan for $3.5 million then pays the third party back, thus allowing him to keep the property for the lower payment.Harmless?  Where do you think the $8.3 million difference is coming from?  Not from the bank.  It's the reason all us common folks are only getting 0.01% on our savings; we are all paying for these financial abuses.  How many retirees had to sell their homes and move in with their kids because their savings no longer produce any income?In all fairness, Mr. Siegel feels really bad about the transaction, and even says so, but nonetheless takes advantage of these financial loopholes, just as anyone would.  He even proposes that our legislatures close these financial loopholes and reign in the banks.  Good luck getting that done.See this film - It's a MUST SEE!",5,A Must See for Everyone,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,1940,"['What', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'here', 'King', 'Queen', 'Versailles', 'seem', 'perfectly', 'nice', 'well', 'meaning', 'folks', 'film', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'super', 'rich', 'deceive', 'say', 'Tax', 'lower', 'rate', 'everyone', 'else', 'will', 'use', 'extra', 'money', 'create', 'jobs', 'Really', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'best', 'intentions', ""'m"", 'being', 'generous', 'real', 'world', 'never', 'out', 'way', 'jobs', 'created', 'are', 'mostly', 'minimum', 'wage', 'jobs', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'pay', 'personal', 'nanny', 'enough', 'visit', 'kids', 'back', 'Philippines', 'once', '15', 'years.Mr', 'Siegel', 'really', 'sincere', 'have', 'doubt', 'really', 'doing', 'good', 'helping', 'people', 'just', 'everyone', 'top', '1', '%', 'super', 'rich', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'real', 'world', 'suffering', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'go', 'day', 'just', 'get', 'by.Case', 'point', 'Mr.', 'Siegel', 'make', '11.8', 'million', 'payment', 'bank', 'property', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'make', 'deal', 'bank', 'wo', ""n't"", 'budge', 'third', 'party', 'buy', 'loan', '3.5', 'million', 'then', 'third', 'party', 'back', 'thus', 'allowing', 'keep', 'property', 'lower', 'payment.Harmless', 'Where', 'do', 'think', '8.3', 'million', 'difference', 'coming', 'Not', 'bank', 'reason', 'common', 'folks', 'are', 'only', 'getting', '0.01', '%', 'savings', 'are', 'paying', 'financial', 'abuses', 'How', 'many', 'retirees', 'had', 'sell', 'homes', 'move', 'kids', 'savings', 'no', 'longer', 'produce', 'income', 'fairness', 'Mr.', 'Siegel', 'really', 'bad', 'transaction', 'even', 'so', 'nonetheless', 'advantage', 'financial', 'loopholes', 'just', 'anyone', 'would', 'even', 'legislatures', 'close', 'financial', 'loopholes', 'reign', 'banks', 'Good', 'luck', 'getting', 'done.See', 'film', 'MUST', 'SEE']",N/A

1547517,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0087IT80A,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[10, 13]","The Queen of Versailles is a surprisingly objective view of a family's descent from riches to something else. Although I'm not a huge fan of the subject matter, this is an example of a really well made documentary.The Queen of Versailles follows the Siegel family for around two years. He is in his 70's, she is in her 40's, and they have eight children. He made an incredible amount of money as the owner of the most successful timeshare company in the country. She got an engineering degree and was Miss something or another beauty queen. Today, there is nothing natural about her, and that does make it difficult to watch. The arc of the story is their cross from having more money than they know what to do with through the stock market crash and finding themselves over leveraged and have to cut back. The riches were so huge; they decided to build a 90,000 square foot house based loosely on Versailles because they had outgrown their 30,000 square foot house (which looked almost like hoarders lived there). The first third of the film was recorded before the crash during their glut times. The last two thirds was how the family did not deal with losing almost everything - the nannies, two thirds of the house staff, etc.Jacqueline Siegel is a moderately unlikeable person. She isn't stupid, but she does a lot of not smart things. It is painful to watch her treat her children like little play things that other people can take care of (she has seven of them and acquired an eighth). David Siegel is irritating in the way he treats his family and spends most of his waking hours dealing with making money. The worst is toward the end when he complains loudly about not turning the lights off, but misses that he's losing millions of dollars with his stupid decisions.All that to say, I still loved this film. It would have been so easy to make fun of this crew, they are simple targets. Instead the director looked at their lives objectively, and presented the story as this is just the way it is with no judgment. I didn't hate the family, nor did I love them; they just were greedy. They were also incredibly clueless to life around them. The director never brought up Jacqueline's early comment about, handbags being a great thing to buy; you can always sell them on eBay. Another director would have made an easy laugh out of that.The film has about the right pacing, it moves along gradually to the inevitable demise at the end. The production was excellent, good clean sharp shots, spot on editing, and no nasty handheld random camera movement.I disliked the characters, but loved the film.",4,Well Made Documentary,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2606,"['Queen', 'Versailles', 'surprisingly', 'objective', 'view', 'family', 'descent', 'riches', 'something', 'else', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'subject', 'matter', 'example', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'documentary.The', 'Queen', 'Versailles', 'Siegel', 'family', 'two', 'years', '70', '40', 'have', 'eight', 'children', 'made', 'incredible', 'amount', 'money', 'owner', 'most', 'successful', 'timeshare', 'company', 'country', 'got', 'engineering', 'degree', 'was', 'Miss', 'something', 'beauty', 'queen', 'Today', 'nothing', 'natural', 'make', 'difficult', 'watch', 'arc', 'story', 'cross', 'having', 'more', 'money', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'stock', 'market', 'crash', 'finding', 'leveraged', 'have', 'cut', 'back', 'riches', 'were', 'so', 'huge', 'decided', 'build', '90,000', 'square', 'foot', 'house', 'based', 'loosely', 'Versailles', 'had', 'outgrown', '30,000', 'square', 'foot', 'house', 'looked', 'almost', 'hoarders', 'lived', 'there', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'was', 'recorded', 'crash', 'glut', 'times', 'last', 'two', 'thirds', 'was', 'how', 'family', 'did', 'not', 'deal', 'losing', 'almost', 'everything', 'nannies', 'two', 'thirds', 'house', 'staff', 'etc.Jacqueline', 'Siegel', 'moderately', 'unlikeable', 'person', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'lot', 'not', 'smart', 'things', 'painful', 'watch', 'treat', 'children', 'little', 'play', 'things', 'other', 'people', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'seven', 'acquired', 'eighth', 'David', 'Siegel', 'irritating', 'way', 'family', 'most', 'waking', 'hours', 'dealing', 'making', 'money', 'worst', 'end', 'when', 'loudly', 'not', 'turning', 'lights', 'off', 'losing', 'millions', 'dollars', 'stupid', 'decisions.All', 'say', 'still', 'loved', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'easy', 'make', 'fun', 'crew', 'are', 'simple', 'targets', 'Instead', 'director', 'looked', 'lives', 'objectively', 'presented', 'story', 'just', 'way', 'judgment', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'family', 'did', 'love', 'just', 'were', 'greedy', 'were', 'also', 'incredibly', 'clueless', 'life', 'director', 'never', 'brought', 'up', 'Jacqueline', 'early', 'comment', 'handbags', 'being', 'great', 'thing', 'buy', 'can', 'always', 'sell', 'eBay', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'easy', 'laugh', 'that.The', 'film', 'right', 'pacing', 'along', 'gradually', 'inevitable', 'demise', 'end', 'production', 'was', 'excellent', 'good', 'clean', 'sharp', 'shots', 'spot', 'editing', 'nasty', 'handheld', 'random', 'camera', 'movement.I', 'disliked', 'characters', 'loved', 'film']",N/A

Chen,"[2, 3]","This is a fascinating movie since it may be the only documentary to capture someone who considers himself a ""master of the universe"" at the beginning of the film but the subject's finances deteriorate dramatically.I must be one of the few reviewers who think David S. doesn't look too terrible in this movie. He married a trophy wife and he essentially admits to this. Jackie comes off favorably in the first 20 minutes but she's too smart for us to pity her by the end when she tries to use her ignorance in her favor.The main lesson is to live within your means. The #1 goal for making a ton of money is so that one doesn't have to worry about money again. David S. made some critical mistakes to allow himself in the situation where he is stressing every day about money.This movie reminds me of Tom Wolfe's novel, A Man in Full. Maybe marrying a trophy wife leads to this pattern where the wealthy spouse feels the need to impress the younger partner, and the spending (ie, conspicuous consumption) reaches unsustainable levels.If I have some qualms with the movie, it's that some key facts are not clearly laid out in the movie. Jackie is David's third wife--there can be 0 doubt in her mind that she's a trophy wife and that she should have an iron-clad pre-nup for the likely/eventual divorce. I have to assume they didn't want to discuss pre-nup terms on camera because it would be fascinating to find out their thought processes on those. Finally, it's pretty obvious that Jackie S. had breast implants at some time, but I wish the movie went ahead and said when that occurred because I decided to search online to confirm this.TL/DR: If you have wanted to see what characters from Bonfire of the Vanities and A Man in Full are like in real life, here's your chance.",4,Real-life versions of Tom Wolfe characters,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,1775,"['fascinating', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'documentary', 'capture', 'someone', 'who', 'master', 'universe', 'beginning', 'film', 'subject', 'finances', 'deteriorate', 'dramatically.I', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'reviewers', 'who', 'think', 'David', 'S.', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'terrible', 'movie', 'married', 'trophy', 'wife', 'essentially', 'Jackie', 'off', 'favorably', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'too', 'smart', 'pity', 'end', 'when', 'use', 'ignorance', 'favor.The', 'main', 'lesson', 'live', 'means', '1', 'goal', 'making', 'ton', 'money', 'so', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'money', 'again', 'David', 'S.', 'made', 'critical', 'mistakes', 'allow', 'situation', 'where', 'stressing', 'day', 'money.This', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Wolfe', 'novel', 'Man', 'Full', 'Maybe', 'marrying', 'trophy', 'wife', 'pattern', 'where', 'wealthy', 'spouse', 'need', 'impress', 'younger', 'partner', 'spending', 'ie', 'conspicuous', 'consumption', 'unsustainable', 'levels.If', 'have', 'qualms', 'movie', 'key', 'facts', 'are', 'not', 'clearly', 'laid', 'out', 'movie', 'Jackie', 'David', 'third', 'wife', 'can', 'be', '0', 'doubt', 'mind', 'trophy', 'wife', 'should', 'have', 'iron-clad', 'pre-nup', 'likely/eventual', 'divorce', 'have', 'assume', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'discuss', 'pre-nup', 'terms', 'camera', 'would', 'be', 'fascinating', 'find', 'out', 'thought', 'processes', 'Finally', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Jackie', 'S.', 'had', 'breast', 'implants', 'time', 'wish', 'movie', 'went', 'ahead', 'said', 'when', 'occurred', 'decided', 'search', 'online', 'confirm', 'this.TL/DR', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'characters', 'Bonfire', 'Vanities', 'Man', 'Full', 'are', 'real', 'life', 'here', 'chance']",N/A

1547521,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B0087IT80A,Doug Erlandson,"[2, 2]","""The Queen of Versailles"" is the true story of David and Jacqueline Siegel, who made their fortune during the time-share boom of the early 2000s, only to lose much of it during the bursting of the subprime mortgage bubble of 2008. The movie is a compelling documentary compiled from 200 plus hours of footage of the Siegels during these years. We see them living in an already lavishly furnished 19,000 sq. foot house as their fortune rapidly increases, spending enormous sums of money on all sorts of baubles. We watch as construction takes place on what they hope will be their new mansion, a 90,000 sq. foot replica of Versailles. Seemingly the only reason they have for building such an elaborate and over the top structure is because with their wealth they can.And then come the financial reverses. Construction is halted on Versaillles. It sits half completed and gathering dust. David Siegel goes from being an effusive, seemingly happy fellow to a cantankerous old man, so concerned about the size of his electric bill that he scolds the other family members for leaving lights on when they leave the room. Jacqueline, meanwhile, tries hard to retain the trappings of wealth, an increasingly difficult task because she has had to lay off almost all of her household staff.Through it all, the movie remains true to its documentary status. At no time do we feel that we are being preached to. We are simply given the facts and hear the words of the Siegels themselves as they react both to their successes and reversals. We are left to judge for ourselves whether they are fundamentally good or corrupt people and whether ultimately they are tragic or comic figures.At the same time we see the truth in the saying that two things reveal a person's true character more than anything else--abject poverty and enormous wealth. After watching ""The Queen of Versailles"" I was reminded of the words of Agar son of Jakeh: ""Give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread.""",5,The American dream?,1382486400,"10 23, 2013",2013,1991,"['Queen', 'Versailles', 'true', 'story', 'David', 'Jacqueline', 'Siegel', 'who', 'made', 'fortune', 'time-share', 'boom', 'early', '2000s', 'only', 'lose', 'much', 'bursting', 'subprime', 'mortgage', 'bubble', '2008', 'movie', 'compelling', 'documentary', 'compiled', '200', 'hours', 'footage', 'Siegels', 'years', 'see', 'living', 'already', 'lavishly', 'furnished', '19,000', 'sq', 'foot', 'house', 'fortune', 'rapidly', 'spending', 'enormous', 'sums', 'money', 'sorts', 'baubles', 'watch', 'construction', 'place', 'what', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'mansion', '90,000', 'sq', 'foot', 'replica', 'Versailles', 'Seemingly', 'only', 'reason', 'have', 'building', 'elaborate', 'top', 'structure', 'wealth', 'can.And', 'then', 'come', 'financial', 'reverses', 'Construction', 'halted', 'Versaillles', 'half', 'completed', 'gathering', 'dust', 'David', 'Siegel', 'being', 'effusive', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'fellow', 'cantankerous', 'old', 'man', 'so', 'concerned', 'size', 'electric', 'bill', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'leaving', 'lights', 'when', 'leave', 'room', 'Jacqueline', 'meanwhile', 'hard', 'retain', 'trappings', 'wealth', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'task', 'had', 'lay', 'off', 'almost', 'household', 'movie', 'true', 'documentary', 'status', 'time', 'do', 'feel', 'are', 'being', 'preached', 'are', 'simply', 'given', 'facts', 'hear', 'words', 'Siegels', 'react', 'successes', 'reversals', 'are', 'left', 'judge', 'are', 'fundamentally', 'good', 'corrupt', 'people', 'ultimately', 'are', 'tragic', 'comic', 'figures.At', 'same', 'time', 'see', 'truth', 'saying', 'two', 'things', 'reveal', 'person', 'true', 'character', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'abject', 'poverty', 'enormous', 'wealth', 'watching', 'Queen', 'Versailles', 'was', 'reminded', 'words', 'Agar', 'son', 'Jakeh', 'Give', 'poverty', 'riches', 'give', 'only', 'daily', 'bread']",N/A

I guess that goes to show that even a home worth millions can look horrible on the inside.I found that I didn't feel sorry for the family, as they were having to &#34;cut-back&#34; to only several staff, but they were still maintaining their lavish lifestyle of shopping, botox, charity events, etc.  It was entertaining to see &#34;The Queen&#34; have to do budget cuts and go from using a private jet to commercial air, renting a car, and assuming that a commercial rental car company came with a driver.I guess I was entertained enough to watch the whole thing, but mostly out of sheer disbelief that someone could have that much money, be so spoiled, and buy the crazy items that they did.

While David Siegel gloats about his ability to make money and his political clout in getting George Bush elected ""illegally"", the banking crisis of 2008 undermines his highly leveraged time share business and he faces bankruptcy. His trophy wife, Jackie, 30 years younger, is a shop-a-holic who he seems to have little respect for. He is obsessed with trying to find a solution to his economic troubles, and virtually ignores his 8 children who are raised by their nannies. Construction on their 90,000 sq. ft. mansion, ""Versailles"", is halted, and they have to settle for living in their 26,000 sq. ft. home with only 4 nannies. The house is over-run with pet snakes and dogs who leave their droppings on the floor. Fortunately, most of the kids are screened from too much attention in the film.The hubris and greed of this couple was hard to watch. Their ostentatious life style is focused on spending and owning - homes, cars, airplane, jewelry, shoes, bags - Jackie bragged that she spent a million dollars a year on her wardrobe; and yet she looks trashy with extremely tight clothing revealing her huge fake breasts, spiked heels worn with her short shorts, and long stringy blond hair. Her husband hardly notices her, and has no time for his children. She claims to know nothing about their money troubles except the fact that he says she has to be on a budget; however he doesn't take away her credit cards. For Christmas, she went on a shopping spree at what looked like Walmart, throwing items in the cart without even looking at them. And she bought herself a $2,000 tin of caviar (obviously NOT at Walmart...)In a play for sympathy, there is one highly staged scene where she makes the kids part with some of their belongings, and loads them into the car to take them to the local charity. To celebrate David's birthday, she (or more likely the nannies) cooks a family dinner which is served in foil pans on the dining room table with no placemats or napkins and the kids eating with their hands. At one point Jackie complains that none of the government bailout money to the banks has actually been used to help the ""common"" people like themselves.I really wonder why this family allowed themselves to be the subject of this documentary - did they really think that people were going to admire them and look up to them?

It can be taken as a tale of wretched excess, of the implosion of the American Dream. or as proof that the rich (at least the nouveaux riches) are perhaps not so different from you and me.""The Queen of Versailles"" is a documentary about David and Jacqueline Siegel, Florida billionaires who made a mint in the time-share boom of the early 2000s, only to go bust when the subprime mortgage bubble burst. The symbol of their rags-to-riches-to-rags story is their unfinished 90,000-square-foot house, named and modeled after Versailles, which they are forced to put on the market. The early portion of the film depicts the Siegels' life of childish self-congratulation in their current 26,000-sq.-ft. mansion, replete with gilt thrones, shoe closets the size of airplane hangars, and portraits of themselves in royal robes. The later footage shows their lives falling into chaos. David becomes increasingly grumpy and withdrawn; Jackie continues her shopping sprees (only at discount stores rather than Neiman-Marcus), and finds it impossible to cope with her eight unruly children and pack of un-housebroken American Eskimo dogs with a severely depleted household staff. And all the while Versailles sits gathering spiderwebs, while the bank schemes to put it into foreclosure.More than one critic has pointed out the irony of the Siegels suffering the same fate, albeit on a larger scale, as their time-share clients. Yet as Greenfield portrays them--in remarkably unguarded scenes culled from more than 200 hours of film--the Siegels aren't unlikable. To be sure, they have character flaws magnified first by their wealth, then the loss of their wealth. But David Siegel is no worse than most other guys obsessed with their businesses, and Jackie obviously has a heart at least as big as her braless breasts. David and Jackie are by no means stupid or unfeeling people; they are human like us. (David, 74 when filming begins, looks maybe 60; two years later, he's 76 and looks every year of it.)There is much here that is poignant, particularly in sequences involving the Siegels' longtime nanny and Jackie's old high school friend. If we fell into money, we might be more tasteful and less wasteful than the Siegels in spending it. But though we might chuckle at specific things they do, we can't say we would always be wiser than they were.",5,How do you sum up the Siegels?,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,2439,"['Lauren', 'Greenfield', 'Queen', 'Versailles', 'funny', 'sad', 'appalling', 'touching', 'once', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'tale', 'wretched', 'excess', 'implosion', 'American', 'Dream', 'proof', 'rich', 'least', 'nouveaux', 'riches', 'are', 'perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'different', 'Queen', 'Versailles', 'documentary', 'David', 'Jacqueline', 'Siegel', 'Florida', 'billionaires', 'who', 'made', 'mint', 'time-share', 'boom', 'early', '2000s', 'only', 'go', 'bust', 'when', 'subprime', 'mortgage', 'bubble', 'burst', 'symbol', 'rags-to-riches-to-rags', 'story', 'unfinished', '90,000-square-foot', 'house', 'named', 'modeled', 'Versailles', 'are', 'forced', 'put', 'market', 'early', 'portion', 'film', 'Siegels', 'life', 'childish', 'self-congratulation', 'current', '26,000-sq.-ft.', 'mansion', 'replete', 'gilt', 'thrones', 'shoe', 'size', 'airplane', 'hangars', 'portraits', 'royal', 'robes', 'later', 'footage', 'lives', 'falling', 'chaos', 'David', 'increasingly', 'grumpy', 'withdrawn', 'Jackie', 'shopping', 'sprees', 'only', 'discount', 'stores', 'rather', 'Neiman-Marcus', 'impossible', 'cope', 'eight', 'unruly', 'children', 'pack', 'un-housebroken', 'American', 'Eskimo', 'dogs', 'severely', 'depleted', 'household', 'staff', 'while', 'Versailles', 'gathering', 'spiderwebs', 'bank', 'put', 'foreclosure.More', 'one', 'critic', 'pointed', 'out', 'irony', 'Siegels', 'suffering', 'same', 'fate', 'albeit', 'larger', 'scale', 'time-share', 'clients', 'Greenfield', 'remarkably', 'unguarded', 'scenes', 'culled', 'more', '200', 'hours', 'film', 'Siegels', 'are', ""n't"", 'unlikable', 'be', 'sure', 'have', 'character', 'flaws', 'magnified', 'first', 'wealth', 'then', 'loss', 'wealth', 'David', 'Siegel', 'worse', 'most', 'other', 'guys', 'obsessed', 'businesses', 'Jackie', 'obviously', 'heart', 'least', 'as', 'big', 'braless', 'breasts', 'David', 'Jackie', 'are', 'means', 'stupid', 'unfeeling', 'people', 'are', 'human', 'David', '74', 'when', 'filming', 'maybe', '60', 'two', 'years', 'later', '76', 'year', 'much', 'here', 'poignant', 'particularly', 'sequences', 'involving', 'Siegels', 'longtime', 'nanny', 'Jackie', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'fell', 'money', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'tasteful', 'less', 'wasteful', 'Siegels', 'spending', 'might', 'chuckle', 'specific', 'things', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'wiser', 'were']",N/A
1547541,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0087IT80A,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","From what I could tell this documentary began as a look at one of the most successful self-made men in America and his much younger trophy wife.  Specifically, they thought the film was about their building of the ""largest house in America,"" a 90,000 square foot indulgence to replace their meager 40,000 s.f. starter home in central Florida. When asked why, Jackie said because he ""deserved it."" David said, ""Because I could.""David Siegel became the head of the largest time share corporation in the world.  He married a former beauty queen who grew up in rural New York.  Jackie and David each married for the second time and went on to have 8 children.  Jackie admits she only wanted 2 but it became so easy and they had the money, so they just kept going.  After sinking millions ($5 million for Italian tile to be used in the garage!) into the new home (modeled after Versailles in France) the market collapsed and Siegel was unable to get funding from the desperate banks beginning in late 2008.The focus of the film then becomes what is to happen to the family and the thousands of employees of the firm.  Director and documentarian Lauren Greenfield does a remarkable job, not only giving the viewer a sense of glee watching the family go through perceived crisis after crisis.  Somehow we begin to have a hint of sympathy.  Well, not really.Still from what was presented, Siegel wasn't a bad business man, didn't make poor investments and didn't try to stiff buyers.  His business depended on huge sums of cash to build and maintain resort time-shares including the largest ever, in Las Vegas.  He didn't create Ponzi schemes or mysterious investment instruments.  Jackie, despite her glaring over indulgence, was kind, generous and conscious of her roots.

It is well edited and decently shot, though I think the final scene was not white balanced, so it was quite jarring to see the film's payoff sequence look so different from the previous hour and a half. Production quibbles aside, QUEEN is a riches-to-rags story where David Siegel, ""Time Share"" king of Central Florida, and his third wife, the blonde Jackie Siegel, are building a dream home, which when completed will be America's biggest. Despite some truly humanizing moments in this film where Mr. and Mrs. Siegel grapple with the fact that they could lose everything due to the 2008 financial crisis, it's hard not to see them as profoundly vulgar and selfish people who are not only victims of their own greed, but people whose greed has wreaked havoc and hardship on other people's lives. At one point in the film you come to find that if Mr. Siegel would just sell a prized building on the Vegas strip he could likely erase his debts and (presumably) re-hire thousands of people he's laid off, which includes people who spent years raising his own children. He doesn't do that. Instead he digs in with resolve to save a neon skyscraper ... The worst part of this all is that the filmmaker frames this event as some sort of demonstration of manly, foolish pride when even the most shallow analysis would lead most people to see Siegel's behavior as irresponsible and destructive to an extreme. Why the filmmaker chooses to simply skate past this fact must have been a creative and narrative decision because it is certainly not a moral one.

They live in Florida where nannies tend to their eight children, one of whom they ""inherited."" While in the middle of building the largest house in the United States (inspired by Versailles), the economic crisis hits. David's timeshare empire, the biggest in the world, faces severe cutbacks.Few tears are shed. The Siegels can be hilariously clueless and outrageous, but they also share moments of regret and generosity. As monetary woes sink in, the excess which was a source of pride for the couple becomes a garish nightmare. In spite of her degree in computer engineering, the buxom, botoxed Jackie claims to be in the dark about their financial situation. David becomes consumed with saving his company, often ignoring the rest of his family or lashing out at Jackie, who admits that she is living in a fantasy world. (The movie's apt title recalls Marie Antoinette and her notorious decadence.)Before the crisis, one of their many children says it best: they never think about money, but they always think about money. The sense of anxiety hanging over the Siegels will be familiar to many Americans, but their opulence will not. David and Jackie blame the banks for lending them too much money, even though David's cutthroat Westgate Resorts dangles the American Dream in front of people who likely can't afford it.This well-edited movie interviews the Siegels, their children, employees, servants, and old friends. We find out that the hired help have the smallest rooms in the house and haven't seen their family in years. They tend to children who, along with the pets, appear to be accessories. When David embarks on a Citizen Cane like quest to rescue his wealth, it's not difficult to conclude that Jackie, and perhaps all women, are also possessions to many men in the moneyed world. Hints at strained or broken family relationships are also telling.This searing family portrait illuminates both the current state of the country and the effect of money on the psyche. The film doesn't clearly track the trajectory of David's company, but it does display hollow, disturbing, and even repulsive results of great wealth.",5,"Unusually excellent documentary, appropriately titled",1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,2291,"['Lauren', 'Greenfield', 'masterful', 'documentary', 'Queen', 'Versailles', 'billionaire', 'David', 'Siegel', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Jacqueline', 'great', 'recession', 'live', 'Florida', 'where', 'nannies', 'tend', 'eight', 'children', 'one', 'whom', 'inherited', 'middle', 'building', 'largest', 'house', 'United', 'States', 'inspired', 'Versailles', 'economic', 'crisis', 'hits', 'David', 'timeshare', 'empire', 'biggest', 'world', 'severe', 'cutbacks.Few', 'tears', 'are', 'shed', 'Siegels', 'can', 'be', 'hilariously', 'clueless', 'outrageous', 'also', 'share', 'moments', 'regret', 'generosity', 'monetary', 'woes', 'sink', 'excess', 'was', 'source', 'pride', 'couple', 'garish', 'nightmare', 'spite', 'degree', 'computer', 'engineering', 'buxom', 'botoxed', 'Jackie', 'claims', 'be', 'dark', 'financial', 'situation', 'David', 'consumed', 'saving', 'company', 'often', 'ignoring', 'rest', 'family', 'lashing', 'out', 'Jackie', 'who', 'living', 'fantasy', 'world', 'movie', 'apt', 'title', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'notorious', 'decadence', 'crisis', 'one', 'many', 'children', 'best', 'never', 'think', 'money', 'always', 'think', 'money', 'sense', 'anxiety', 'hanging', 'Siegels', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'many', 'Americans', 'opulence', 'will', 'not', 'David', 'Jackie', 'blame', 'banks', 'lending', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'even', 'David', 'cutthroat', 'Westgate', 'Resorts', 'American', 'Dream', 'front', 'people', 'who', 'likely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'it.This', 'well-edited', 'movie', 'Siegels', 'children', 'employees', 'servants', 'old', 'friends', 'find', 'out', 'hired', 'help', 'have', 'smallest', 'rooms', 'house', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'family', 'years', 'tend', 'children', 'who', 'pets', 'appear', 'be', 'accessories', 'When', 'David', 'Citizen', 'Cane', 'quest', 'rescue', 'wealth', 'not', 'difficult', 'conclude', 'Jackie', 'perhaps', 'women', 'are', 'also', 'possessions', 'many', 'men', 'moneyed', 'world', 'Hints', 'strained', 'broken', 'family', 'relationships', 'are', 'also', 'telling.This', 'searing', 'family', 'portrait', 'current', 'state', 'country', 'effect', 'money', 'psyche', 'film', ""n't"", 'clearly', 'track', 'trajectory', 'David', 'company', 'display', 'hollow', 'disturbing', 'even', 'repulsive', 'results', 'great', 'wealth']",N/A

1547551,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B0087IT80A,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[8, 10]","I decided to watch this documentary after I saw previews of it.  I have no regrets of watching this documentaty and I recommended it to everyone I know.  This is a story of David Siegel and his third wife (Jackie) and their 8 children (7 biological and one adopted niece).  Siegel made his wealth by selling time shares.  His business became family venture and two of his sons from two of his previous marriages are involved with the business.One of the deciding factors for making this movie was Siegel's decision several years ago to build the largest privately own home in the United States and call it ""Versailles"".  Like typical American new rich Siegel would stop at nothing to show off his wealth.  This house was supposed to cost him $75 million.  All was good until one day financial crises hits, people start loosing jobs and vacations, let alone timeshares stopped selling.  Stuck with huge loans from the banks, for his enourmous empire, Siegel starts to experience financial strain.  It starts small, from laying off people to trying to preserve his home and one of the most valued assets he had in Las Vegas.  During that entire time, his faily is unable to cope with their basic responsibilities such as keeping the house clean, feeding family pets, controlling the budget.  His wife takes a limo to get her lunch and MacDonalds on her way to the plastc surgeon where she undergoes laser and Botox treatment for her skin.  In the meantime their children are moved from private to public schools and there are no guarantees they will even have money to go to college (with trust funds gone, these kinds will have to take out student loans if they want higher education).From every point of view, this film is something else.  These people are so detached from reality and the meaning of real care and compassion for other people and animals that is heartbreaking to watch.  It is as if they live in their own fairy tale unable to accept the reality of their situation.  It is as if bad things can only happen to other people and not to anyone else.  The most amazing thing to me is that Siegel still believes that he can get his time share empire back.  And I fully understood the irony of it when a collegue of mine said ""Do people still buy and keep time shares these days?"".  Even in documentary, they mention that many of the time share places are under foreclosures.  If time shareowners knew they were loosing their ""properties"" they would pretty much stop making their payments and cut their loses.  But instead, they are sort of financing lifestyles of the time share owners who are destined for doom.I do not feel sorry for suckers who buy time share nor for the sellers of time share business.  I always thought it was the scam.  And after you hear Siegel and his family members talk disparigingly about buyers of time share business perhaps you will agree with me and not find this opinion to be too harsh.  Worth seeing.  It will stay imbedded in your psyche for a long time after you saw this documentary.

The reason it confused me is because i wasnt sure if I should feel sorry for the people or not give a crap. Truth is, I dont feel sorry at all for them, though I can understand that even wealthy people have hardships and life struggles. The documentary follows the family of David Siegel, CEO of Westgate Resorts. When filming began for this documentary, business was booming. Mr. Siegel and his wife were building the largest house in the country and were at the height of their lives. However, that all changed when the recession hit and banks began to tighten credit. The business fell and it fell hard. Construction on the house was halted and they had to sell off assets just to stay afloat.The the start of the documentary you dont like the people. They seem stuck up, full of themselves and very materialistic. However, it seems as though the recession humbled them and made them realize that there are other more important things to life. At the same time though, Mr. Siegel never seems to stop caring about money. His days are all devoted to saving his company even at the expense of his relationship with his family. Its always hard to judge people who are in documentaries because you never know how they are edited, though the wife seems to really have a change in her worldview after the recession, but still spoiled and still very ignorant to real world and real life.All in all, this is a very interesting and engaging documentary.

So close in subject matter to trashy TLC fare, yet so superior in terms of insight and intelligence. The film is a critique on the American dream for sure, but it's also about fufillment and happiness.""Versailles"" follows the Siegels family; a ludicrously wealthy clan that would be right at home on an episode of ""The Fabulous Life."" Timeshare bigwig David Siegel is the family's patriarch and self-admitted poster boy for success: he's rich, armed with a boobalicious ""trophy"" wife, and is father to 8 nice, but spoiled, children.These people live a faberge egg life: glossy and extravagant, but truly hollow at the center. During interviews, David brags gleefully about his achievements from the comfort of a golden throne, yet look into his eyes and you'll find sorrow. Jackie has a constant need for buying things; spending more than 2 million dollars on clothes a year. She seems in want of something, something that she erroneously believes can be bought with money. Is it love, affection? Who's to say.The plot of ""Versailles"" is a riches to (sort of)rags story. When the stock market crashes, David's resort business suffers severely, and in consequence the Siegels are forced to downsize and sell their new, unfinished, $100 million mansion. The layers of their high-life are slowly stripped away, and they're forced to learn many lessons about life the hard way.People like the Siegels' are the reason why documentaries were made. They are interesting, complex, and dynamic. What is even better is that Greenwood doesn't portray the Siegels' as inpenetrable or condescending. Jackie, one of the characters I was expecting to dislike, turns out to be  the film's  bright spot. She is contemptable for her values, but she is also strong willed and intelligent. In one scene, Jackie discusses her original dream of becoming an engineer, and how she then switched to modelling out of fear for living a life unfufilled.With ""Versailles,"" Greenwood has created an important and thought provoking film. Money can bring happiness, just don't expect it to last long. That's the problem with The Siegels.' They love wealth but it has also become a normalcy, like paying bills or driving mini vans. The grand allure that luxury once held for them has diminished, and all they want is to have the original ""high"" back.In many ways they're after the same thing that the poor and middle class are after: happiness,comfort and security.  Greenwood saw the tragic humanism in the Siegel's situation, and thanks to this ""Versailles"" becomes somewhat of philosophical endeavor rather than a cheesy expose. Not only is the film about weatlh, it is about fufillment and the illusive paths we often go down just to find it.",5,4.5 Look beyond the surface (and the boobs),1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,2769,"['Queen', 'Versailles', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'So', 'close', 'subject', 'matter', 'trashy', 'TLC', 'fare', 'yet', 'so', 'superior', 'terms', 'insight', 'intelligence', 'film', 'critique', 'American', 'dream', 'sure', 'also', 'about', 'fufillment', 'happiness', 'Versailles', 'Siegels', 'family', 'ludicrously', 'wealthy', 'clan', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'home', 'episode', 'Fabulous', 'Life', 'Timeshare', 'David', 'Siegel', 'family', 'patriarch', 'self-admitted', 'poster', 'boy', 'success', 'rich', 'armed', 'boobalicious', 'trophy', 'wife', 'father', '8', 'nice', 'spoiled', 'children.These', 'people', 'live', 'faberge', 'egg', 'life', 'glossy', 'extravagant', 'truly', 'hollow', 'center', 'interviews', 'David', 'gleefully', 'achievements', 'comfort', 'golden', 'throne', 'look', 'eyes', ""'ll"", 'find', 'sorrow', 'Jackie', 'constant', 'need', 'buying', 'things', 'spending', 'more', '2', 'million', 'dollars', 'clothes', 'year', 'want', 'something', 'something', 'erroneously', 'can', 'be', 'bought', 'money', 'love', 'affection', 'Who', 'say.The', 'plot', 'Versailles', 'riches', 'sort', 'rags', 'story', 'When', 'stock', 'market', 'crashes', 'David', 'resort', 'business', 'suffers', 'severely', 'consequence', 'Siegels', 'are', 'forced', 'downsize', 'sell', 'new', 'unfinished', '100', 'million', 'mansion', 'layers', 'high-life', 'are', 'slowly', 'stripped', 'away', ""'re"", 'forced', 'learn', 'many', 'lessons', 'life', 'hard', 'way.People', 'Siegels', 'are', 'reason', 'why', 'documentaries', 'were', 'made', 'are', 'interesting', 'complex', 'dynamic', 'What', 'even', 'better', 'Greenwood', ""n't"", 'portray', 'Siegels', 'inpenetrable', 'condescending', 'Jackie', 'one', 'characters', 'was', 'expecting', 'dislike', 'out', 'be', 'film', 'bright', 'spot', 'contemptable', 'values', 'also', 'strong', 'willed', 'intelligent', 'one', 'scene', 'Jackie', 'original', 'dream', 'becoming', 'engineer', 'how', 'then', 'switched', 'modelling', 'fear', 'living', 'life', 'unfufilled.With', 'Versailles', 'Greenwood', 'created', 'important', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'Money', 'can', 'bring', 'happiness', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'last', 'long', 'problem', 'Siegels', 'love', 'wealth', 'also', 'become', 'normalcy', 'paying', 'bills', 'driving', 'mini', 'vans', 'grand', 'allure', 'luxury', 'once', 'held', 'diminished', 'want', 'have', 'original', 'high', 'back.In', 'many', 'ways', ""'re"", 'same', 'thing', 'poor', 'middle', 'class', 'are', 'happiness', 'comfort', 'security', 'Greenwood', 'saw', 'tragic', 'humanism', 'Siegel', 'situation', 'thanks', 'Versailles', 'somewhat', 'philosophical', 'endeavor', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'expose', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'weatlh', 'fufillment', 'illusive', 'paths', 'often', 'go', 'down', 'just', 'find']",N/A

I expected from the reviews that the wife would be completely unsympathetic.  Actually, she had a lot of interesting twists and turns in her life already, and wasn't simply repulsive.  The fact that filming began before the family's financial problem hits presents an interesting contrast--at first, everyone is playing it up as an upbeat reality tv show (although I have never watched more than a few minutes of any such show); later, as financial worries intrude, there is an air of negative social commentary as this family tries to carry on under threat of foreclosures and with a reduced staff and hundreds of laid off workers.  This, no doubt, is why the family has attempted to sue the filmmakers.  Anyway, these people are trying to build the world's largest and most obscenely rococo single-family residence, to replace the sad little thing on their private island.  The recession intervenes, lots of little dogs drop lots of little turds all over the place, and there's no one left to pick them all up.

1547557,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B0087IT80A,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[8, 11]","More than the ""QUEEN of Versailles"" this fascinating documentary could best be titled ""The FAMILY of Versailles"" since there is almost as much time spent with the ""Time Share King"", David Siegel, as with his ""trophy wife"" Jackie. And then there are the eight kids, who mostly act like spoiled brats.There are lots of other reviews already posted here but most are based on the theatrical version. I hope to provide a few comments on the film itself and also discuss the DVD and Bluray discs.This 100-minute documentary wins on a number of levels. The first part - when the Siegels are at the top of their rich lifestyle, building a 90,000 square foot mansion (with 32 bathrooms!) to replace their ""lowly"" 26,000 square foot home (with ONLY 17 bathrooms) - shows you how the rich live and have power. (Just listen as Siegel tells you that it was HE who got George W. Bush elected President.) When documentarian Lauren Greenfield began this project she was making a film about the rich. Then things change and the financial crash of 2008 occurred. Greenfield stuck with the project and the film turned direction. Now the family had to downsize - a LOT. And Greenfield was there to capture it.Of course the centerpiece of the film is Jackie - the mid-40s woman who grew up in a middle class house in Binghamton, NY and became a beauty queen. When she met Siegel (after both had failed marriages) she became his trophy wife. Siegel, who owned the largest time-share company in America, likes things BIG. He builds the largest homes, the largest time shares and - based on the archival footage of Jackie in Her beauty pageant days - he must have encouraged her to have breast enlargement surgery because this lady makes Dolly Parton's chest look normal!While the comments from Jackie and their children might make you laugh, those from both Siegel and his son from the first marriage provide a lesson in business management and sales. And if you don't shed a tear when the Filipino ""nanny"" is on camera I'll be surprised.The DVD and Bluray each have the same ""Bonuses"". In addition to the Theatrical Trailer there are eight ""deleted scenes"", totaling 22 minutes. While we are never told why Greenfield chose not to include the scenes (a Director's commentary on them would have been nice), they do add to knowing more about the Siegels and are well worth watching. One shows a ""day at the Spa"" with Jackie getting her body tanned and then seeing ""Aunt Sue"" arrive. Sue - who I don't remember seeing in the film - is an amputee (with a Louis Vuitton replacement leg! - really). Another shows Jackie returning to the diner in Binghamton where she was a waitress when she was 17. The most fascinating (to me at least) deleted scene has virtually nothing to do with the Siegel's life. It shows how Westgate Resorts (the time share company) would entice ""average folk"" to buy a time share/ This short video will be quite educational to those who might be enticed by time share offerings.What I really found lacking in the DVD package was a Director's commentary by filmmaker Greenfield. This film calls out for one. How did she find the Siegels and what was HER impression of their lifestyle? We hear her ask a few questions on screen during the film but there had to be more. The DVD was an opportunity missed.So yes, I highly recommend the film as an eye-opener on a world most of us will never know.

The film ends with the Siegels still in their ""smaller"" house and only the Las Vegas timeshare sold.

What I can not understand is how someone so clueless as Siegel could have possibly created such a financial empire. I'm in awe of his accomplishment and his ignorance at the same time. Mind blowing. But it does not stop with Mr. Siegel. No, the entire family seems to suffer from the same delusions.Half way thru the movie I had to put it on pause to run to the web to see if this was a real movie or a mockumentary.It's real. Okay back to the movie.On the one hand I really did feel for these people. I was inspired by their success but dumbfounded by their lack of humility, empathy & decency. I can't help but wonder if the filmmaker had a story they wanted to tell and this family provided the raw footage to tell it. Either they were treated very unfairly, or they are the most clueless people on the planet. Yes, money really does grow on trees, and not only that but you don't even have to harvest it, you just hire someone to rake it all up and bring it to you in baskets overflowing.I highly recommend the movie.Note: One thing I noticeed here on Amazon is how some reviewers try to equate this movie with capitalism and the American culture. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reason this family stands out is because it is so abhorrent to the American culture. To those who would wish to use this movie for their political agenda, I say, baloney.

1547559,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B0087IT80A,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[3, 4]","Then perhaps it Will be Revolting...I see a lot of negative from reviewers about this film. From the title I assumed it was something completely different than what it was. I think I assumed it was about what it appears to originally be intended (a film about the lifestyle of the new super-rich). But that's not what this film is about. What it's ACTUALLY about is the real estate crash and what it did to these people's lives.I love these peopleAnyone who knows me well knows that for years I have struggled with a personal issue: In the past I have grown to hate rich people. Many find this odd given that I once was one myself (though I didn't realize it at the time). I grew up surrounded by rich snobs who treated my like dirt, and became terminally depressed as a teen. As I grew older and realized the plight of poor people, I became filled with (what to me seemed) righteous indignation. I still struggle with those feelings, but I strive to love everyone. Interestingly, the people who are the subject of this documentary are easy to love. They seem to represent the very best of this class of people (from my personal experience). They're warm, friendly, cheerful, and good-hearted people (or at least that's how they come across to me). They are tasteless and crass in some ways, excessive, selfish, and eccentric, both neither one is stupid, and the wife earned some serious admiration from me as the documentary progressed. Strange as it sounds, they are the kind of people I wouldn't mind having as friends.The Fall of An EmpireI was living in Anaheim California during the Real Estate crash of 2008, and had nothing to do except sit around unemployed and watch the shocking story unfold on CSPAN. It was the best political soap-opera I have ever witnessed. Seeing how it personally effected people heavily invested in the real estate business was incredibly compelling for me, as it's an angle I haven't seen before (we've all seen loads of footage of poor people with balloon mortgages losing their houses, but I never considered what would happen to a heavily leveraged business that made it's money off of real estate).This whole story felt eerily familiar to me. My parents lost everything in the California Construction Industry Crash, and I watched them go through almost the exact same process. I watched my father sold off resources desperately trying to salvage his business as my mother continued to buy cases of bottled water at 1.50 plus per bottle. I watched it happen in shock after years of telling them (who takes business advice from a 12 year old) that they needed to invest and set money aside for emergencies. And like these people, my parents had built their life up from hard work. They weren't born rich.The Best Rich Wife in AmericaI've seen plenty of rich women in my time living in both Orange Counties (Orlando and California) and I'm here to tell you, they don't come better than the wife shown here. Is she self-absorbed? Sure. Does she spend money like crazy? Yeup! Is she out of touch and overly concerned with her appearance? Sure, sure. BUT!!!! This woman CLEARLY has a head on her shoulders and a heart of gold.She didn't come across as having much class, but this woman is LOYAL. She is obviously a trophy wife, and she knows it, but she is appreciative of what she has. She got a degree and a first-class job at IBM, and then left because she realized it would be wasting her life (I work at IBM and know exactly what she means). That takes guts. She married a man who treated her decently (even if his appreciation for was shallow) and spent all her money on creating a fun life with a big family (a much smarter thing to do than being a miser who worries about losing what they have).When things turn south and the big life she had evaporates, where is her head at? Is she crying over her lost house? Yelling at the kids and dogs! Arguing with her husband? Cursing out the greedy banks? Nope. She says she ought to take some pictures to remember the good times. If she moves into a middle class sized house (to her that would be like living in a shack) she says she'll make it work. When her husband is being a jerk because he's stressed out of his mind she takes his point of view, telling the kids that he's going through a lot. Even with her whole world collapsing, she still wants to show affection to her husband to reassure him that she still loves him and is on his side. What a woman!Enjoy it While it LastsI agree with these people 100%. As my dear old dad once said, the government should have given the bail-outs to the people. Because they just would have paid their bills to the banks with it or spent it anyway. Instead the bailouts went to the banks who then sat on the money because they are greedy and paranoid and the economy entered a depression as a result (idiots). As a student of economics, I can definitely tell you that would have been a better solution. Heck, you could see how upsetting it was to the man to see all those employees who used to get a living off of him gone. He did everything in his power to keep the business moving. More than can be said for the banks that wanted to take his buildings and then change their minds about letting him stay in business.I remember when my parents were losing everything and my mother kept right on spending, and some things that she did. Once she asked me if I wanted a tuxedo. I said no, because I didn't think we could afford it. She said the money would be spent anyway and I would never have another chance. I got the tux. Another time she offered me a new leather jacket. She deal. And finally, years later when she won a lawsuit she gave me the money to take a few days to Disney World for my honeymoon. Could my mother afford to do any of these things? Nope. But I was married in that tux. I made priceless memories on that honeymoon. If I did it over again I would change nothing. My point? Anyone who criticizes a woman who used to be super-rich and is losing everything for buying Christmas presents and eating caviar doesn't understand what they are going through. This woman had spending habits that were hard to break. And she was enjoying the last of what was left. I wouldn't begrudge her any of it. Because in the end, she was worth it.EntertainingUltimately, if you enjoyed watching Inside Job, Sicko, or reading books like Richistan, or especially I.O.U. you will probably enjoy this film. Just moreso if you have ever been in their shoes and/or lived in Orlando Florida (my favorite place on Earth, and the place I will always consider my real home).",5,"If you've been these people it

1547564,A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S,B0087IT80A,Thomas E. Davis,"[17, 21]","*** May contain spoilers ***Schadenfreude is a word that comes to English from the German language; it signifies pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others. And after just half an hour of the wretched excesses perpetrated by David and Jacqueline Siegel, a pair of nouveau riche Florida Republicans whose failed financial speculation put thousands out of work and impoverished many more, you will wish for more misfortune to fall upon their heads than this simultaneously entertaining and horrifying documentary can possibly deliver.Before he became a king of his industry, David was a commoner who stumbled upon a clever scheme: building and selling vacation timeshares by convincing average folks to accrue debt and feign wealth for a few days every year. As he opines with a shrug, ""If you don't want to be rich, you must be dead."" After making a mint in the process of developing one of the largest timeshare companies in the world, Westgate Resorts, he married a former Mrs. America, bought an enormous house, and decided they needed to climb even higher on the ladder of success. The Siegels were in the midst of constructing the largest and most expensive private home in America, an outlandish $100 million, 90,000-square-foot edifice in the style of Versailles, when the bottom fell out of the real estate market in 2008, the end of a bubble they themselves helped to inflate.This honest, unflinching, and frequently unflattering portrait of their family - eight kids whom they spoil rotten, Filipina nannies who haven't seen their own children in years, a straight-faced driver who calls the Siegels ""down-to-earth"" - reveals a lot about what wealth does to shallow people whose lives are predicated on thoughtless acquisition and consumption. For Mr. and Mrs. Siegel are indeed common: the would-be Queen of Versailles, with her huge fake boobs, is like a vulgar child who can't control her appetites, whether she's spending a million dollars a year on gaudy clothes or picking up bags of fast food from McDonald's in a stretch limousine. Even her own daughter calls her a ""trophy wife.""Jackie's elderly husband, who at times barely tolerates his spouse and their offspring, is obsessed with his business and clearly craves the status derived from associating with billionaires and powerful politicians: he boasts that Donald Trump complained to him about the brightness of the neon sign on his Las Vegas high-rise, and that he single-handedly won Florida for George W. Bush by possibly illegal means. (In 2012 he sent a notorious email to his employees, advising them to vote for Mitt Romney and implying that they might be looking for new jobs if Barack Obama were reelected.)The recession deepens, and we watch with a mixture of satisfaction and disgust as fate takes the king and queen down a few pegs: they are forced to put their empty shell of a mansion on the market and to fly on a commercial airliner rather than their private jet. Hilarity ensues as Jackie rents a car for the first time and asks the Hertz agent for the name of her driver. Her husband, meanwhile, struggles to keep his company afloat, but he can't sell enough of his properties or raise enough money from investors like Trump to pay the builders of his Las Vegas development, which is hundreds of millions of dollars in arrears and headed for foreclosure. He blames his lenders, of course, who ""got us addicted to cheap money."" Sound familiar? Shedding crocodile tears yet?The Siegels continue to cut back, laying off 15 of their 19 household staff, taking their children out of private schools and putting them into public ones, and informing the kids that they might actually have to go to college and earn a living for themselves. Can you imagine? The children forget to feed and water a pet lizard, which dies along with their tropical fish, while the house becomes a mess - dog poop everywhere - and Jackie herself is pressed into service in the kitchen. She opens a thrift shop for her former employees, who are losing their homes, and stocks it with castoffs from her own home. Yet she continues her absurdly compulsive shopping (though she now goes to Wal-Mart instead of upscale retailers) between visits to a dermatology clinic for facial peels and Botox injections.We can see where this story is headed long before we arrive at its conclusion: to save his company, David finally sells out and lets the banks take his Las Vegas towers. The massive Florida house stands unfinished, an ineluctable monument to the Siegel's folly and lack of restraint. The viewer is left to contemplate (since the Siegels certainly won't) the combination of greed, hubris, and stupidity that led to this financial debacle, and how the personalities and values of those behind it contributed to its unfolding. Lauren Greenfield has produced a well-made, warts-and-all film that is emblematic of our era and contains plenty of food for thought.

Their 26,000 sq ft house is too small, so they are building a 90,000 sq ft one, based on the palace at Versailles. That's what the documentary starts out about. Then, the economic collapse hits, and actually affects them so they must cease construction on this huge palace and fire 19 of their 24 or so household staff. There is still money for a non-surgical facelift for the forty-something wife with basketball-size false boobs married to the 75 yr old husband with enormous gut, but they must forgo private planes with their 7 kids and niece. This movie was a horror show of what happens to people when they simply have too much money. There is no compassion for the Filipino nanny who has not seen her own children in 11 years. There is no feeling for pets, even, who are allowed to crap all over the floor (dogs) or simply allowed to die (reptiles, fish) from neglect. This is how the next generation of monsters is made: give kids so much that they have absolutely no compassion for anyone or anything -- because if they do not sometimes do without, they lack sympathy for those who do without on a regular basis. That this behavior can be learned is shown by the adopted niece, who grew up in a less-privileged environment, but who allows her pet to die of hunger and thirst and then says, with 16 yr old attitude, I'm sorry I'm such a horrible person. Why yes, honey, that is one definition. Anyone who lets helpless, dependent animals die a horrible death from sheer laziness is exactly that. And this is the one who should have known better. This movie is a horror show, and if anything explains why we should limit vast accumulations of wealth when others are suffering. Certainly, the super-rich will not limit themselves. The husband crows that he was the one who got W elected, then demurs from explaining, as it ""was probably not legal."" No, it was probably treason, and yes, the Iraq war and its casualties resulted. You would have to look far and wide to find a less sympathetic subject for a documentary, a man so focused on money he doesn't care for his wife, his kids or his countrymen. One interesting point, early on in the movie, Siegel says proudly that Donald Trump complained about the sign from his Las Vegas tower -- it was shining into the Donald's penthouse. Later, when the building is lost to bankruptcy, the light is turned off. Are we supposed to believe that the Donald had something to do with that? This is what occupies the minds of billionaires? Not global warming or global hunger, but how to control every aspect of their immediate surroundings, to the extent of influencing banks to push for a bankruptcy so a light can be turned off?

This documentary is a very good cautionary tale that we should all heed lest we fall into excessive & destructive greed for material things.",2,Excessive living at its best (or worse),1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,1021,"['movie', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'enactment', 'adage', 'fool', 'money', 'are', 'soon', 'parted', 'main', 'characters', 'David', 'Siegel', 'wife', 'seemed', 'materialistic', 'soul-less', 'beings', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'brought', 'soul', 'documentary', 'was', 'Filipino', 'maid', 'story', 'father', 'wanting', 'concrete', 'house', 'life', 'never', 'got', 'concrete', 'tomb', 'being', 'house', 'last', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'feel', 'sorry', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'raised', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'empathy', 'can', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'children', 'rich', 'are', 'often', 'drug-addicts', ""ne'er-do-wells"", 'hope', 'men', 'who', 'gravitate', 'towards', 'trophy', 'wives', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'woman', 'kept', 'spending', 'frivolously', 'even', 'when', 'knew', 'were', 'financial', 'bind', 'husband', 'wife', 'are', 'totally', 'heartless', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'sympathize', 'documentary', 'very', 'good', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'should', 'heed', 'lest', 'fall', 'excessive', 'destructive', 'greed', 'material', 'things']",N/A

The Siegels seem to have had it all at the beginning of the documentary but it wasn't enough and the greed of wanting ""more"", just because they could (i.e. a 90,000 sq ft home) got them in the end.  At first you might be envious of this family but then you come to find out they are not perfect either (actually probably worse off).  Their ""perfect"" world started collapsing and it was interesting to see how they handled it (which didn't seem to be very well).  I see why Siegel wanted to stop this documentary from coming out -- he looks like a pathetic, pompous jerk from beginning to end and he couldn't stand to let people see that he failed.  Mrs. Siegel is likeable but in the end, I just felt sorry for her too.  Just a family that got too self-involved in their fortune and it was interesting to watch.",4,Good watch,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,942,"['interesting', 'documentary', 'well', 'produced', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'when', 'get', 'too', 'greedy', 'Siegels', 'seem', 'have', 'had', 'beginning', 'documentary', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'greed', 'wanting', 'more', 'just', 'could', 'i.e', '90,000', 'sq', 'ft', 'home', 'got', 'end', 'first', 'might', 'be', 'envious', 'family', 'then', 'come', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'actually', 'probably', 'worse', 'off', 'perfect', 'world', 'started', 'collapsing', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'handled', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'see', 'why', 'Siegel', 'wanted', 'stop', 'documentary', 'coming', 'out', 'pathetic', 'pompous', 'jerk', 'beginning', 'end', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'let', 'people', 'see', 'failed', 'Mrs.', 'Siegel', 'likeable', 'end', 'just', 'felt', 'sorry', 'too', 'Just', 'family', 'got', 'too', 'self-involved', 'fortune', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch']",N/A
