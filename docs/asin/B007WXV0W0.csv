The episodes are the same from television but its nice to watch one anytime or watch them all in a row!  My boys (4 and 5 years old) love Thomas and with school coming up we are working on manners and working together.  Thomas and Friends are great examples for kids as the show teaches lessons like its okay to make mistakes, don't be jealous of your friends, work together, be yourself, be safe and more.  The episodes are full of fun trains, bright animation, and music!",5,Yeah for Manners!,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,577,"['fun', 'Thomas', 'DVD', 'four', 'episodes', 'fourteenth', 'fifteenth', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'are', 'same', 'television', 'nice', 'watch', 'one', 'anytime', 'watch', 'row', 'boys', '4', '5', 'years', 'old', 'love', 'Thomas', 'school', 'coming', 'up', 'are', 'working', 'manners', 'working', 'together', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'are', 'great', 'examples', 'kids', 'show', 'lessons', 'okay', 'make', 'mistakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'jealous', 'friends', 'work', 'together', 'be', 'be', 'safe', 'more', 'episodes', 'are', 'full', 'fun', 'trains', 'bright', 'animation', 'music']",Thomas & Friends: Schoolhouse Delivery

""Creative Madness Mama - Quilts &...","[3, 3]","By the title I was expecting this DVD to have Thomas episodes featuring basic skills like counting, colors and shapes, but that is not what I discovered. Schoolhouse Delivery gets it's name from the first episode where in fact there is a delivery to the school house. However there is still plenty of back-to-school fun to be had in character building if not arithmetic basics. I agree that there are timeless lessons that can never be taught too much in learning friendship, cooperation, obedience and structure. It is important to be yourself, but also part of the team. Thomas & Friends is always fun and we are becoming fast fans in our family.*Thanks to the publicist for providing a copy for review.*",4,Character Building,1349395200,"10 5, 2012",2012,706,"['title', 'was', 'expecting', 'DVD', 'have', 'Thomas', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'basic', 'skills', 'counting', 'colors', 'shapes', 'not', 'what', 'discovered', 'Schoolhouse', 'Delivery', 'name', 'first', 'episode', 'where', 'fact', 'delivery', 'school', 'house', 'However', 'still', 'plenty', 'back-to-school', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'character', 'building', 'not', 'arithmetic', 'basics', 'agree', 'are', 'timeless', 'lessons', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'taught', 'too', 'much', 'learning', 'friendship', 'cooperation', 'obedience', 'structure', 'important', 'be', 'also', 'part', 'team', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'always', 'fun', 'are', 'becoming', 'fast', 'fans', 'family', '*Thanks', 'publicist', 'providing', 'copy', 'review', '*']",Thomas & Friends: Schoolhouse Delivery
