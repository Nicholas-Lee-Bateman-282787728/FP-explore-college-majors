167228,A2LHSABDHUIEYK,0964083817,Interested Observer,"[10, 11]","This work is about one hour long.  The product now on sale also includes a second DVD of extras.  Some reviews indicate that an earlier product included only the main feature and I would agree that was somewhat skimpy at the price.  On the other hand this is a limited audience product (and limited budget) whose costs cannot be spread out over millions of copies as with major cinematic features.  I don't know about the production issues around this but it seems to me that Nike could have easily financed the acquisition of any needed footage and it would be very appropriate that they do so.  It is a very good production for what might be a ""labor of love"".Strengths.1. Extensive set of substantial interviews with people who knew Prefontaine both in the feature and on the extra disc.I especially liked getting Bowerman and Dellinger after being exposed to two movie portrayals andIan Stewart's reflections on the Munich 5000 before, during and after.2. A well assembled biography including his fight with the AAU and role in the success of Nike.3. The bio information that accompanies the interview segments on the extras DVD.4. A fairly realistic assessment of Prefontaine's actual accomplishments and ability with a minimum of fan hype.In particular I appreciate the realistic review of the Munich race.  As good as he was it was unlikely that he could win iteven if it came down to a ""guts race"" (and for him it did) and even if the pace had been brisk from the start.(A faster race would have probably preserved a medal for him with more distance back to the pack but one must seriouslyquestion if Pre was capable of lowering his U.S. trials 13:22PR sufficiently to match what Viren had done (13:19.0 in July 1972) or what he could do in that faster race considering that only four days after the Munich final Viren lowered the WR to 13:16.3.  It would appear that Viren had advantage to spare in any tactical scenario.)Stewart makes this point well, everything Pre could threaten (like a sub 4:00 final 1600),was within the reach of 3 or 4 others who would likely be in the race and with better finishing speed to boot.Viren in particular had no reason to fear Pre as all his best times were substantiallysuperior to Prefontaine's including the world record 10K final he had run at Munich eventshowing he was in top form at Munich and a 13:19.0 5K run July 1972 at Helsinki.Viren had far more reason to be concerned with others in the field such as:- Gammoudi, who had risen to the occasion in 1964 and 1968 to acquire a complete set of medals.- 3000m WR holder Puttemans (record set in 1972) who would later in 1972 lower Viren's new WR by three seconds.- Ian Stewart whose PR at the time was equivalent to Prefontaine's and thus could hang onto a pacebut also had the potential to finish the last lap under 55 seconds off a fast pace.At Munich it is fair to say that Viren had Pre coming and going in the absence of a prodigious career breakthrough at age 21.  In an article by Kenny Moore I found online it is clear that this was not a secret to Pre or his coaches and teammates before the race after they saw Viren set the 10K record on his way to a gold medal after falling down in mid-race.  Their only hope was that it might have tired him a bit.  What hope that gave was dashed by the delay caused by the Palestinian terror episode in which all the Israeli hostages were killed, that also provided Viren with ample rest.  All I get from the post-mortem analyses of the race by various Oregon experts (Bowerman, Moore, Dellinger etc) in print is that had he run the last two laps differently, he might have held on to a medal but do not convince me that he had a real shot at the gold.Prefontaine ruled U.S. running and records in his events with an iron fist.  But at no time was he demonstrably superior to thewhole world in peak form.  He held all the American records, a bit soft by world standards, but never held or seriously threatened a world record.He never dominated top non-Americans on the international circuit.The final race with Norpoth comes to mind. But perhaps Norpoth did have to bleed since to win Norpoth set his own PR 13:20.6, about two seconds ahead of Pre's best time to date. and retired shortly thereafter.  Pre never promised to win every race, only that anyone who beat him would have to bleed to do it.All that might have been just around the corner as the documentary suggests but itnever happened in the tangible reality of major international races won or a world record set or even a near miss. (Still, consider that while hardly a near miss on the clock, his 27:43 10K AR under the conditions it was run (cold, windy, and solo) was at least equivalent to the Viren/Clarke 27:39 level or even the Bedford 27:30.8WR of the time. The conditions, as described in Kenny Moore's book, Bowerman and the Men of Oregon, might well account for the roughly .5 sec per lap difference with the Bedford WR.  In the 10K at least he can be said to have been finally knocking loudly on the WR door.)6. It delivers a balanced portrayal and appreciation of a great athletic presence, rarely equaled competitive spirit,and (is there a argument here?) the greatest U.S. born distance runner of all time.Weakness.Too short and bit superficial on the sport itself.  Very little in the way of extended coverage of full events.  The event coverage is extremely weak and running footage is mostly used to highlight the discussion or interview background.  This is good for a general audience documentary but more should be done with the extras disc.Considering the Prefontaine video I have found on You-Tube I think the (or another) extra DVD should have assembled many more complete races (or at least final several laps) with top competitors and with better video quality than You-Tube.In particular:The 1972 Olympic trials race against George Young with splits shown to compare with the presentation in Without Limits.The 1972 Olympic final (there was enough in this DVD to see the critical fight before the finish however)Some of his mile races in particular, the 3:54.6 race with Wottle, the indoor events on You-Tube.Some of his wins in major U.S. events such as the NCCA or AAU, American record setting events etc.Some of his three mile wins, especially under 13:00 which was not common at the time.(I would like to see the real race portrayed in Without Limits, I think I found the timebut that race was against WSU not Stanford as portrayed in order to have Kardong in the race.If someone can clear up this point I would appreciate it. I doubt there is footage for a regular season college meet.I recall seeing Pre out-run Don Kardong in a Pac 8 final on TV at the time of the event.)The HS two mile record.American records at various distances or any really well contested races.The 1973 race with Norpoth.Actually, the more the better as far as I am concerned.Given a choice, the record preserved by the interviews is more important, so the producers have done well.Still I hope someone is working on preserving the archive footage of races.====================================================================================Quibble:The extra disc entry on Pre's personal records makes a point of stating that Pre's collegiate records for the 3 mile (12:53.4) and 6 mile (27:09.4) still stand.  Anyone who knows anything knows that this is only because these distances are no longer contested and apparently no one is taking split times in the current 5K and 10K events.  It does not take much arithmetic to realize that Rono's 5K 13:08.4 (a WR at the time incidentally at a mere dual meet) (or even Bill McChesney's ""U.S. born"" collegiate record of 13:15.8) are substantially superior to the 3 mile mark and that Kamau's 27:36.2 10K (and Ed Eyestone's ""U.S. born"" 27:41.5) are also comfortably ahead of the 6 mile mark.  It is a disservice to a viewer who does not follow the sport to leave the impression that any of Pre's major records are really still standing (leaving out school records, meet records, stadium records etc.  It will be quite a day in Coos Bay when anyone breaks the Marshfield HS records).Questions:Did Bowerman really run off 12:36 during the memorial service to represent a 63 second lap three mile as shown in Without Limits?  (Yes. It is described in Bowerman and the Men of Oregon by Kenny Moore.  12:36.4 to be exact.)How did Pre really hurt his foot before that NCAA final?",4,Well produced documentary as far as it
