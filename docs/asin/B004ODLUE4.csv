He's not laugh-a-minute, and he's not exactly a ""current events"" comic - he won't make any Twitter references or political jokes.  He can however make the seemingly mundane topic hilarious, such as random searches on Google, a conversation with an Owl, and of course, a traffic jam encountered during the filming of Cash Cab.I'd compare him to Jim Gaffigan, Brian Regan, Kevin James perhaps - he's relatively clean with only a bit of profanity (not that I'm bothered either way, but some may wish to know this before viewing with children, family, etc.)Very funny - I highly recommend.

1422966,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004ODLUE4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[15, 15]","Being a big fan of ""Cash Cab,"" I was eager to see what taxi driver/game show host Ben Bailey would do in a stand-up routine.  Bailey doesn't get a lot of moments to shine or to display much depth in his regular television gig, but has always seemed an affable conversationalist and likable personality.  His comedy set capitalizes on an unexpected quirkiness and succeeds, in large part, thanks to Bailey's unusually aggressive style of delivery.  Some of the material that he employs might not necessarily elicit a laugh from a different comedian--but Bailey's in-your-face demeanor serves his stand-up routine well.Bailey's topics of humor are rather unexpected and somewhat tame.  If you like your comedy blue and bawdy, Bailey may not be your first choice of entertainment.  Aside from some language, his set should be appropriate for more sensitive viewers.  Playing riffs on his size and relative fame lead to what he calls ""accidental ornithology.""  Indeed, I don't believe that I've ever witnessed a monologue where birds were a recurring motif.  But several of the extended sequences reference our feathered friends and other nature of birds.  Fans should also appreciated an extended comic sequence about road rage while filming his television series.Bailey is a funny guy whose presence commands the stage.  It isn't the most riotous set I've ever seen, but I appreciated the unusual material and how he tailored situational humor for his preexisting fans.  And like I said--for me, it was all about the delivery.  His personality really pops!
