486585,A39GB8QKJDWKRK,6306012389,"A.C. ""toonstuff""","[5, 5]","David Duchovny and Minnie Driver star in this wonderful throwback to the classic romantic comedy.  Duchovny plays a widower whose wife, due to an organ donor card, saved the life of another woman upon her death.  What Duchovny's character doesn't know is that the heart of his deceased loved one now beats in the single granddaughter (Driver) of the man he has just befriended.When sparks fly between the two, it seems nothing can stop the widower's return to romance... until Driver's character discovers who he is.This movie is a wonderful, heartwarming event that is filled with comedy and tears.  While Duchovny and Driver are more than adequate in the roles, the real applause is for Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, and the other old curmudgeons that guide the two lovebirds on their quest for happiness.Suitable for a date movie or for family viewing, Return to me has my highest recommendation.",5,Charming Romantic Comedy,972864000,"10 30, 2000",2000,900,"['David', 'Duchovny', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'star', 'wonderful', 'throwback', 'classic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Duchovny', 'widower', 'wife', 'due', 'organ', 'donor', 'card', 'saved', 'life', 'woman', 'death', 'What', 'Duchovny', 'character', ""n't"", 'know', 'heart', 'deceased', 'loved', 'one', 'now', 'single', 'granddaughter', 'Driver', 'man', 'just', 'befriended.When', 'fly', 'two', 'nothing', 'can', 'stop', 'widower', 'return', 'romance', 'Driver', 'character', 'discovers', 'who', 'is.This', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'heartwarming', 'event', 'filled', 'comedy', 'tears', 'Duchovny', 'Driver', 'are', 'more', 'adequate', 'roles', 'real', 'applause', 'Carol', ""O'Connor"", 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'other', 'old', 'curmudgeons', 'guide', 'two', 'lovebirds', 'quest', 'happiness.Suitable', 'date', 'movie', 'family', 'viewing', 'Return', 'highest', 'recommendation']",N/A

Minnie Driver is Grace, a young woman who recently had a heart transplant; she's never been able to do many things, like dating or traveling. She was raised by her devout grandfather (Carroll O'Connor), who owns an Irish-Italian restaurant, and his equally sweet, elderly cronies. Bonnie Hunt (the director) plays Grace's best friend, Megan, and Jim Belushi is her crude but loving police-officer husband. All of the actors are likable and believable in their roles.I was especially touched by the unabashed displays of faith: Grace's grandfather says the rosary during her surgery and asks others to. Characters go to church. Megan and her husband have a typically large, boisterous Catholic family.This movie doesn't have a mean bone in its body. (Do movies have bones? Or bodies?) There isn't a character here you won't like. The humor is sweet and gentle, and your kids can even watch it.

Salama,"[0, 0]","From an absurd plot - Chicago architect Duchovny falls in love with the much younger woman who (unknown to him) has received the transplanted heart of his dead wife - first time director Bonnie Hunt (who also has a good role in the movie) has crafted a very good romantic comedy. Minnie Driver, in particular, as the virginal Grace (this is a very catholic movie) has never been better as the object of Duchovny's chaste affection. The main question of the movie is how Duchovny will react when he learns about Grace's history - and how that will affect their relationship. The film is also a paean to a particular milieu - working class ethnic America, particularly the Italian, Polish and Irish groups that intersect in Chicago - that is fast disappearing as a result of assimilation.",4,Very good romantic comedy,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,786,"['absurd', 'plot', 'Chicago', 'architect', 'Duchovny', 'love', 'much', 'younger', 'woman', 'who', 'unknown', 'received', 'transplanted', 'heart', 'dead', 'wife', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'who', 'also', 'good', 'role', 'movie', 'crafted', 'very', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'particular', 'virginal', 'Grace', 'very', 'catholic', 'movie', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'object', 'Duchovny', 'chaste', 'affection', 'main', 'question', 'movie', 'how', 'Duchovny', 'will', 'react', 'when', 'Grace', 'history', 'how', 'will', 'affect', 'relationship', 'film', 'also', 'paean', 'particular', 'milieu', 'working', 'class', 'ethnic', 'America', 'particularly', 'Italian', 'Polish', 'Irish', 'groups', 'intersect', 'Chicago', 'fast', 'disappearing', 'result', 'assimilation']",N/A

No matter how thick it may get, it never makes you embarrassed to be sitting there, soaking it all in.So go ahead and soak it all in.Predictably heart-tugging, `Return to Me' opens pretty tragically.  While Grace is lying in wait for a heart transplant, Bob is suffering the loss of his darling wife in a car accident.  It just so happens that Bob's wife was an organ donor and her loss was Grace's gain, for she received a new heart.  By chance (or was it fate?) Bob runs into Grace and instantly finds himself smitten (who wouldn't be smitten by Minnie Driver?).  They may not have a lot in common, but something is there pushing them together.We all know where this is going, but for some reason we are not offended by this.I think the films success lies in the dedicated performances, for the script is a little to `by the books' to make much of an impact on its own.  David Duchovny and Minnie Driver are a beautiful pair, and they feed off every layer of one another wonderfully.  I never watched `The X-Files' and what I have seen from Duchovny has been mixed at best, so this is probably my favorite performance from him.  He plays to Bob's emotional distress flawlessly (that collapse when he gets home made me cry).  Minnie is just amazing in almost everything (I adore her) and this is no exception.  She has such a light in her that emulates every single texture in her character's aura.The supporting cast is pretty great as well, from Carroll O'Connor hamming it up for attention to Bonnie Hunt (who also directed) and James Belushi providing a flawless comedic couple.In the end I totally recommend this movie.

No over-acting here, just simple, quiet reality. A nationally-known reviewer commented on the men's poker group in this picture, saying it was a waste of time, but he was wrong. It just made this a more real place, with real people like your uncles or a friend's father or the guys who hang around your local convenience store.

Happily, it hasn't!The story tells of a likable Chicago construction foreman (David Duchovny), who loses his anthropologist/zoo curator wife (Joely Richardson) in a car accident, later falling in love with a waitress/artist (Minnie Driver), who, unbeknownst to him, had received his wife's heart in transplant surgery. While this scenario is, admittedly, farfetched, director/screenwriter/actress Hunt gives the story so much grace and gentle humor, and fills it with so many memorable characters, it's easy to fall in love with the film.To a soundtrack heavy with Dean Martin tunes (including the title track), we meet their friends...David's 'circle' consists of his construction crew, Joely's assistant and his best friend (David Alan Grier), a somewhat clueless donor/patron (Dick Cusack, real-life father of John and Joan), a beautiful dog named Max, and a remarkable great ape named Sidney (portrayed by an actual gorilla, Kwan). Minnie's circle is fabulous; Carroll O'Connor (in his last film) is her Irish grandfather, with Robert Loggia, his Italian brother-in-law (and her uncle), who co-own 'O'Reilly's Italian Restaurant'(!); Eddie Jones, William Bronder, and Marianne Muellerleile are the rest of restaurant gang; and her best friends Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi (both very, very good!), and their brood of kids round out her circle. With a cast like this, how can you go wrong?Filmed on location in Chicago and in Rome, Italy, this story of love lost and rediscovered never strikes a wrong chord, played out perfectly by Duchovny, Driver, and the remarkable cast.

486616,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6306012389,Bobby Underwood,"[8, 9]","This wonderful film from Bonnie Hunt has a quiet magic rarely seen in film these days. Hunt and Don Lake wrote the screenplay from an original story hatched with Andrew Stern and Samantha Goodman. As with everything Hunt has been involved in, there is a quiet class to every moment in the film.David Duchovny was the perfect choice for Bob, a successful building engineer very much in love with his wife, Elizabeth (Joely Richardson). Elizabeth has a tender passion for a Gorilla named Sidney, whom she has taught sign language. Raising money for a new habitat for Sidney and his expanding family is her purpose in life. It is a passion cut short, however, when a car accident suddenly takes her from Bob's life in an instant.Hunt's screenplay and her direction are both marvelous here. Elizabeth is not just a set-up character for the rest of the story, but rather someone real. So is the relationship between she and Bob. Because Hunt's direction takes the time to make the couple's love real, it is all the more poignant when tragedy strikes. Duchovny's scene where he is slumped against his front door, sobbing with his dog Mel looking on for a love never coming back is touching and very real.Months go by and Bob goes to pot. Mel, who still sits by the front door waiting for Elizabeth to return, is a constant reminder of his loss. His pal Charlie (David Alan Grier) takes him to O'Reilly's, an Irish-Italian place, on a disasterous blind date. Hunt mixes humor with the pathos, and a pretentious bit about bottled water will lead the audience to laughter and Bob to the sweet and funny Gracie.Minnie Driver is simply adorable as Grace, a girl who rides her bike everywhere and worries that she might die and leave her grandfather Matty (Carroll O'Connor) with no one to look after. He has raised her and her concern is very real. She had been near death when a heart suddenly became available and she was given a second chance at life. At the urging of her good friend, portrayed winningly by Hunt herself, she sends an anonymous letter to the surviving relative of the donor thanking them for her heart. She does not know, of course, that the heart which beats in her chest belonged once to Elizabeth.The romance of Bob and Grace is filled with sweetness and charm. He still misses his wife but comes to ache for Gracie. While their romance blooms, there are wonderful scenes of Matty and his pals talking about baseball and singers, comparing Sinatra and Bing to Dean and Vinton. Bob becomes a part of the group, accepted immediately because, like them, his wife has died. Robert Loggia is a real standout as the cook, Angelo.Gracie's self-consciousness about her scar will give she and Bob time to fall in love. But all is shattered in a moment when she discovers her letter in his home, along with a newspaper detailing his wife's accident. Not even the gift of a vintage bicycle can prevent her from using the ticket to Rome her grandpa has given her, hoping Bob will come after her. There is a truly moving moment when Matty takes Bob aside and offers an explanation for all that has happened.Before Hunt brings us to a wonderful ending there is some great music mixed in with the warmth and humor of this fine film. Even Jackie Gleason's sweet and pure orchestra version of ""Tenderly"" is used. Jim Belushi is marvelous as Hunt's funny and down-to-earth husband. There isn't a wrong note in this entire film. This is what a romantic date movie should be but seldom is. Minnie Driver riding her bicycle in the middle of the night just to tell her friend Megan (Bonnie Hunt) she has finally met someone is so endearing you will never forget it.

David Duchovny's character we meet when he's still married, just before a terrible accident takes his wife from him, and leaves him a grumpy friend and boss.  Minnie Driver's character is a girl who's probably never dated much, other than the crazy character's her best friend sets her up with.  When Minnie and David meet, there's a spark right away.  Maybe it's her sense of humor (and a hint of revenge) when she trick's the girl David has just met on a blind date and is obviously annoying him to no end with her snobbish attitude and boring talk.  Or maybe his joke back when he catches Minnie pulling the prank.  But something starts, and through the movie, you enjoy watching these two fall in love, and don't really want it to end.  Of course, the plot is enjoyable, but so are all the actors, who seem at ease and natural in their rolls.  And besides that, there's the dialog.  This is one of the few modern movies (1990's or later) in which I never cringed at a line of dialog--it's all so good, believable, and smooth.

This film is somewhat courageous in the way it wears its heart on its sleeve in these days when any spark of sentiment is usually couched in irony.  Bob Rueland (David Duchovny) has lost his beloved wife (Joely Richardson) in a traffic accident; Grace Briggs (Minnie Driver) has received her heart in a transplant operation.  It's not giving anything away to let you know that fate brings them together in the end.  As soon as the film opens, you know that it couldn't go any other way./It must be difficult to make such an innocent story work for today's audiences, but writer/director Bonnie Hunt (with co-screenwriter Don Lake) pulls it off.

486660,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6306012389,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 3]","Usually I'm a sap for romantic comedies and I give them a lot of latitude.  It is hard to come up with much that is fresh in a genre that has been so thoroughly plowed.  However, this charming and schmaltzy film was too corny even for me.  Romantic films are normally pretty predictable, but this was ridiculous.  Writer/director Bonnie Hunt gives these characters the depth of a rain puddle.  The plot was so scant that she had to employ excessive filler with farcical skits involving Jim Belushi, and the seniors led by Carroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia.  The fact that the filler was the most entertaining part of the film speaks volumes about the weakness of the main storyline.Bonnie Hunt's directorial debut was a mixed bag.  She captured some endearing moments and her choice for Chicago locations was wonderful.  However, the film's pacing was poor, with numerous dull scenes and a bumpy flow.  The character development of Bob (David Duchovny) and Grace (Minnie Driver) was good, and the romance was enchanting, but there really wasn't that much of an impediment to the relationship.  A truly great romance requires an insurmountable obstacle or irreconcilable differences to be overcome to test the awesome power of love.  The heart transplant device, while novel, really wasn't much of a reason for them to break up.  Hunt also should have made greater use of the device examining its implications more explicitly with Duchovny's character.  She was content to dance around the fact that the two loves of his life had the same heart, a wonderful metaphor that she left in the background rather than developing it.The acting was excellent.  David Duchovny proved to be quite affable in this retreat from the heavy-handed X-Files roles.  This may be the most he has been allowed to smile in any project he has ever taken.  It was enjoyable to see another side of him.  Minnie Driver gave a marvelous performance, probably her best to date.  She was very human; she was insecure about her surgery, but warm and full of hope.  Carroll O'Connor was priceless as Grace's grandfather.  He and Robert Loggia delivered some of the funniest moments in the film.

While I am fine with watching romantic dramas, I am a bit wary when a film vacates the theatre as quickly as this one did. However, the premise was very interesting. Unfortunately, the premise is about all there is.First off, the concept of a heart transplant also transplanting emotion is very sentimental. And it works!. At least for the first few encounters. The problem is the screenwriter stops following the idea past the first few encounters between the two. At first, her heart beats audibly whenever they are near and then nothing, unless you consider the statement that she was feeling hot a carry through.There is also a very contrived &quot;trip to Italy&quot; with foreshadowing about as subtle as a baseball bat to the head. While it sets up one of the more emotional moments of the film, it is also the most inane plot device I have seen in a film in quite some time.Minnie Driver is excellent in the film, doing a good job with a lackluster script. David Duchovny, however, is fair to midline at best; in portions of the film, his acting is so wooden that it breaks the illusion. And, Carol O'Connor is overall believable, but misses his Irish accent a few times in the movie.Final analysis: Compared to some of the other tripe coming out of Hollywood, this is not a bad film. I rate it a bit less than average, but I am comparing it to films throughout history and not those of the past few years. If you want a good cry, there are plenty of tearjerking moments (both happy and sad) to satisfy your appetite. And, once it gets going, the chemistry between Duchovny and Driver is nice.

This film is not a &quot;chick flick&quot; as the preview may make it look. My father and husband loved it as much as I did - in fact, my father recommended to me. The new romance, involving a superb performance by Duchovney, and a decent performance by Driver (she borders on cheesy a couple of times - but makes up for it with some hilarious facial expressions), is pure and sweet instead of just lusty like so many modern flicks. The seasoned romance between married couple Hunt and Belushi almost steals the film. Belushi is one of the brightest points of the film and no one could be his equal in a scene except Hunt.Carol O'Connor gives probably the best performance in the whole film and his card pals will make you roll with laughter. David Duchovney's blind date is the funniest female I've seen on screen in a long time - you love to hate her and laugh at her at the same time. I hope to see her again. Scene after scene creates a tapestry of hilarious and touching characters rather than focusing all the attention on the leads. Few films are able to do that.

It's not a romantic comedy in spite of the efforts of the director to make all the supporting cast hilariously funny. Well, maybe we needed those light touches to elevate the sadness of the story. The first time I saw it, these slapstick moments annoyed me but, after that, I saw that they were necessary to the story. Why have enormously talented comic actors in the supporting cast if you aren't going to use them. It's a very sweet story, dragged out by her rather unreasoning fear of telling him that she has had a heart transplant.  Then she is forced to tell him and the story evolves.  But, who knows, maybe any of us who had someone else's heart beating inside them would be just as weird as she acts.

This film, although very predictable, is charming and quite well done.  My sweetie and I spent a very pleasant Sunday afternoon relaxing together and enjoying this film.In RETURN TO ME, Bob Rueland (David Duchovny) and his wife, Elizabeth (Joely Richardson), are very much in love.  They seem to have the perfect life.  Then tragedy strikes and Elizabeth is killed in a horrible car accident.  Bob is devastated; he is barely functioning.  After about a year, he meets Grace (Minnie Driver), and he feels an immediate connection to her.  Grace has her own secrets, however.  She has recently had a heart transplant, and for the first time in her life is not ""the sick one.""  She doesn't want to tell Bob about her transplant.  As things progress, Grace realizes that she must tell Bob about her medical past.  Unfortunately, it is almost too late, and Grace and Bob may both end up with broken hearts.RETURN TO ME is wonderfully sentimental, very engaging, and very sweet, without being too syrupy.  I cried in the beginning, I cried at the end, and I smiled the entire way through.  It is just a plain nice movie.  Minnie Driver gives her typical excellent performance, and David Duchovny (who, as much as I love him, just can't act) does a fine job.  Bonnie Hunt, as both a first time director and as Grace's best friend, uses her signature humor and dry wit to great advantage, and Jim Belushi is great as her lovable oaf of a husband.  As wonderful as the entire cast is, however, Carroll O'Connor, as Grace's grandfather, and Robert Loggia, as his partner in an Irish-Italian restaurant, steal the show, bringing tears and laughter to your heart each time they are on the screen.  Wonderful old standards permeate this soundtrack, and you will find yourself quietly humming along.RETURN TO ME is pure delight from beginning to end.  Enjoy it with someone you love.

486701,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6306012389,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[11, 11]","The idea of a man falling in love with a woman, who has received the heart of his late wife in a transplant operation, is a story fraught with peril.  One of the most wrenchingly emotional scenes I have ever seen on television was on ""St. Elsewhere"" where Jack Morrison (David Morse) listened to the heart of his wife beating in the body of another woman.  So how ""Return to Me"" gets to that moment when Bob Rueland (David Duchovny) listens to the heart of his late wife, Elizabeth (Joely Richardson), beating in Grace Briggs (Minnie Driver) is, at least for me, a delicate matter.  Fortunately, this romantic comedy has Bonnie Hunt, not only playing Grace's best friend, Megan Dayton, but also as the director and the screenwriter, along with Don Lake.  That means there are some brains to go along with ample heart in this romantic comedy from 2000.""Return to Me"" begins by going back and forth between the two characters in Chicago whose lives and love will collide.  Bob is an architect and one of his planned projects is to create a new living space for the gorillas at the Lincoln Park Zoo where Elizabeth has been raising money for the effort.  Meanwhile, Grace is in the hospital waiting for a heart and being visited by her grandfather, Marty O'Reilly (Carroll O'Connor), and her friend, Megan.  On the night that a dinner is held to celebrate having raised enough money for the zoo project, there is an accident.  We know that Elizabeth's heart is intended for Grace, so Hunt does not bother to play out everything.  We do not see the accident because it is a necessary evil to the story, where the consequences matter much more than needlessly witnessing the event.  Instead the preparations for the operation take place in contrast to Bob giving way to grief at the loss of the woman he loves.  But something sweet happens: once Elizabeth's heart starts beating again, Bob finally finds enough peace to fall asleep.We then come to the most delicate part of the story: how Bob and Grace will meet.  There is an unspoken sense of magic behind what happens in this film, which would explain why it is that Bob and Grace first pass each other at the Monkey House at the Zoo.  There is no meeting, but significantly enough Grace pauses because her heart has started to beat more rapidly.  This is a good sign, and an even better one comes when he is persuaded by a friend, Charlie Johnson (David Alan Grier), to O'Reilly's Italian Restaurant.  Grace works as a waitress in her grandfather's place, where the cooking is done by Angelo Pardipillo (Robert Loggia), and the ongoing debates are over the relative value of Irish (Bing Crosby) versus Italian (Dean Martin) singers.  Bob's date is just not a nice person and when Grace flings back a zinger at her rude condescension, Bob is interested.The rest of the movie obviously consists of tentative romance, where hand holding is more important than sex, and with the full understanding that at the point where they are happiest the truth will come out and have to be dealt with.  At that point we get the movie's best line, ""What was God thinking?""  The line is so great because it is not only funny but it speaks to the film's persistent notion that there is a greater power at work here, even if it turns out to be simply love and not a mischievous deity.  My only complaint, such as it is, would be that ""Return to Me"" fails to come up with a payoff at the end as good as the setup.  Then again, the ending is predictable according to the formula, so it is hard to really come up with a great ""how"" under those circumstances.  But the film is certainly sweet enough for you to weep at the right moments and even if you do not end up crying your eyes out, this is still a laudable effort.Hunt and Lake also get credit for giving the supporting cast some great bits that justify their showing up.  In addition to O'Connor and Loggia having fun at the Irish Italian restaurant, there are Eddie Jones, Marianne Muellerleile, and William Bronder to add zest to the spicy exchanges.  There is only one deleted scene on this DVD, but it is this quintet singing ""Danny Boy,"" and then debating the song.  Jim Belushi plays Joe Dayton and joins with Hunt in double-teaming everybody else in stealing scenes.  Duchovny and Driver are the only ones required to carry heavy emotional baggage and they acquit themselves well in that regard, but the one who really shines is O'Connor as the warm but understated grandfather.  There was no doubt when the moment came for him to say the right thing to the right person at the right time, that he was going to deliver.  The same can be said for Bonnie Hunt's film.",4,What was God thinking?  Something good.

I reply that with RETURN TO ME it did. Director Bonnie Hunt sets up a premise that could easily have been carried off by Rock and Doris, but David Duchovny and Minnie Driver generate the same palpable magnetism that resonated with audiences of a previous generation.  Bob (Duchovny) and Elizabeth (Joely Richardson) are happily married, and the film starts off to be about them.  Then jarringly, she dies in an auto accident, leaving him to grieve as best he can.  Director Hunt juxtaposes Elizabeth's death with the rebirth of Grace (Driver), who needs a heart transplant, and guess who is the donor?  Hunt, who also shines in a supporting role as Grace's best friend, strings together these two strands of disjointed lives, slowly at first with blind date pitfalls with others before allowing them to meet and heal.  Bob loves and misses Elizabeth while Grace feels that her devotion to her ill grandfather precludes a normal love life. Yet, they connect and as they do, they find that they match up right in all the little ways that count.  Robert Loggia, Carrol O'Connor, and Bonnie Hunt interact as a variation of the Greek chorus that comments on the plot but says things that the main characters are probably thinking but dare not say. James Belushi, who usually plays the lead, is the second banana as Bonnie Hunt's husband, and in their own relation seem to be a future version of what Bob and Grace's could be. There is a plot complication of course.  When the source of Grace's heart becomes known to her and Bob, both are overwhelmed with a sense of weirdness.  How both cope with it is the only serious note of the film, aside from Elizabeth's early exit.  What RETURN TO ME is represents a celebration of the discovery of a fount of joy that tragedy can slow down but never quite derail.",4,Return to Me: If Only Life Could Be Like This,1030579200,"08 29, 2002",2002,1922,"['Whenever', 'someone', ""n't"", 'Hollywood', 'make', 'sweet', 'old-fashioned', 'romances', 'way', 'did', 'back', 'old', 'days', 'reply', 'RETURN', 'TO', 'ME', 'did', 'Director', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'up', 'premise', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'carried', 'off', 'Rock', 'Doris', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'generate', 'same', 'palpable', 'magnetism', 'resonated', 'audiences', 'previous', 'generation', 'Bob', 'Duchovny', 'Elizabeth', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'are', 'happily', 'married', 'film', 'be', 'Then', 'jarringly', 'auto', 'accident', 'leaving', 'grieve', 'best', 'can', 'Director', 'Hunt', 'Elizabeth', 'death', 'rebirth', 'Grace', 'Driver', 'who', 'heart', 'transplant', 'guess', 'who', 'donor', 'Hunt', 'who', 'also', 'supporting', 'role', 'Grace', 'best', 'friend', 'together', 'two', 'strands', 'disjointed', 'lives', 'slowly', 'first', 'blind', 'date', 'pitfalls', 'others', 'allowing', 'meet', 'heal', 'Bob', 'Elizabeth', 'Grace', 'feels', 'devotion', 'ill', 'grandfather', 'normal', 'love', 'life', 'connect', 'do', 'find', 'match', 'up', 'right', 'little', 'ways', 'count', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'Carrol', ""O'Connor"", 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'interact', 'variation', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'comments', 'plot', 'things', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'probably', 'thinking', 'dare', 'not', 'say', 'James', 'Belushi', 'who', 'usually', 'lead', 'second', 'banana', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'husband', 'own', 'relation', 'seem', 'be', 'future', 'version', 'what', 'Bob', 'Grace', 'could', 'be', 'plot', 'complication', 'course', 'When', 'source', 'Grace', 'heart', 'known', 'Bob', 'are', 'overwhelmed', 'sense', 'weirdness', 'How', 'cope', 'only', 'serious', 'note', 'film', 'aside', 'Elizabeth', 'early', 'exit', 'What', 'RETURN', 'TO', 'ME', 'celebration', 'discovery', 'fount', 'joy', 'tragedy', 'can', 'slow', 'down', 'never', 'quite', 'derail']",N/A

It is an example of how sometimes they do make them like they used to. Except for its plot device about a heart transplant, it could have just as likely been made forty years ago with Deborah Kerr and David Niven.Bob Rueland [David Duchovny] is a successful Chicago contractor still madly in love with his wife, who was his high school sweetheart. [I told you the picture was old-fashioned.] Meanwhile, across town, Grace Briggs [Minnie Driver] is a very sick young woman awaiting a heart transplant. When Bob's wife is killed in an auto accident, none other than Grace receives the dead woman's heart. A year later, we see the changes in the soon-to-meet pair's lives. He is still grieving and proves difficult to be around. Grace is recovered and is working at her grandfather's restaurant. She's a shy, artistic girl who is very self-conscious. Someone who has been bypassed love, Grace thinks the unsightly scar on her chest makes remote her chances of finding someone . Bob, of course, isn't looking for anyone. Worn down by the badgering of his well meaning best friend, he agrees to a blind date. This disastrous date occurs in the very restaurant Grace works in. I imagine you can fill in the rest of the story.David Duchovny is working hard to get away from his X-Files' character, and here is does a decent job in a role which requires him to change his personality from carefree to gloomy and back again. As Grace, Minnie Driver is excellent. I don't know Ms. Driver, but I always picture her as the sort of person who lights up a room whenever she walks in. She certainly brighten ups any movie she's in. Still, it is Carroll O'Connor as Marty O'Reilly, the grandfather, who steals the show. He and his cronies, played by Robert Loggia, David Alan Grier and Marianne Muellerleile, are delightful as very wise and very nosey senior citizens. A funnier group of matchmakers you are unlikely to see anytime soon.Return to Me is the directorial debut of Bonnie Hunt, who also costars in the movie. Though playing it safe at every turn, she still demonstrates that she has a knack for the job. After all, if every director were flashy and brilliant, then the movies might actually prove to be a less interesting mix of projects. Return to Me serves its simple purposes, which are to entertain us and to make us feel happy and hopeful.",3,Old-fashioned romance has several good qualities,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2508,"['are', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'mood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'away', 'cynicism', 'couple', 'hours', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Return', 'Me', 'sweet', 'light', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'example', 'how', 'sometimes', 'do', 'make', 'used', 'plot', 'device', 'heart', 'transplant', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'likely', 'been', 'made', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'David', 'Niven.Bob', 'Rueland', '[', 'David', 'Duchovny', ']', 'successful', 'Chicago', 'contractor', 'still', 'madly', 'love', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', '[', 'told', 'picture', 'was', 'old-fashioned', ']', 'Meanwhile', 'town', 'Grace', 'Briggs', '[', 'Minnie', 'Driver', ']', 'very', 'sick', 'young', 'woman', 'awaiting', 'heart', 'transplant', 'When', 'Bob', 'wife', 'killed', 'auto', 'accident', 'none', 'other', 'Grace', 'dead', 'woman', 'heart', 'year', 'later', 'see', 'changes', 'soon-to-meet', 'pair', 'lives', 'still', 'grieving', 'difficult', 'be', 'around', 'Grace', 'recovered', 'working', 'grandfather', 'restaurant', 'shy', 'artistic', 'girl', 'who', 'very', 'self-conscious', 'Someone', 'who', 'been', 'bypassed', 'love', 'Grace', 'unsightly', 'scar', 'chest', 'remote', 'chances', 'finding', 'someone', 'Bob', 'course', ""n't"", 'looking', 'anyone', 'Worn', 'down', 'badgering', 'well', 'meaning', 'best', 'friend', 'blind', 'date', 'disastrous', 'date', 'occurs', 'very', 'restaurant', 'Grace', 'imagine', 'can', 'fill', 'rest', 'story.David', 'Duchovny', 'working', 'hard', 'get', 'away', 'X-Files', 'character', 'here', 'decent', 'job', 'role', 'change', 'personality', 'carefree', 'gloomy', 'back', 'again', 'Grace', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'excellent', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Ms.', 'Driver', 'always', 'picture', 'sort', 'person', 'who', 'up', 'room', 'whenever', 'certainly', 'brighten', 'ups', 'movie', 'Still', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'Marty', ""O'Reilly"", 'grandfather', 'who', 'show', 'cronies', 'played', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'Marianne', 'Muellerleile', 'are', 'delightful', 'very', 'wise', 'very', 'nosey', 'senior', 'citizens', 'funnier', 'group', 'matchmakers', 'are', 'unlikely', 'see', 'anytime', 'soon.Return', 'Me', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'who', 'also', 'movie', 'playing', 'safe', 'turn', 'still', 'knack', 'job', 'director', 'were', 'flashy', 'brilliant', 'then', 'movies', 'might', 'actually', 'prove', 'be', 'less', 'interesting', 'mix', 'projects', 'Return', 'Me', 'simple', 'purposes', 'are', 'entertain', 'make', 'feel', 'happy', 'hopeful']",N/A

486723,A33065VK2M1DGE,6306012389,Michael Russell,"[8, 10]","Somebody give Bonnie Hunt a leading role quick! She is such a vibrant actress that she shouldn't be the supporting role in every film she does (The American President, Jerry Maguire, The Green Mile). And now she surprises us even more by directing, writing, and starring in Return to Me, a warm, appealing movie filled with laughter.David Duchovny (The X-Files) plays Bob, an architect whose zoologist wife (Joely Richardson) is killed in a car accident. Minnie Driver (Oscar-nominee for Good Will Hunting) plays Grace, who is desperately in need of a heart transplant. She benefits from Bob's tragedy when she is given his late wife's heart. Eventually Bob winds up in Grace's diner and her grandpa (the late, brilliant Carroll O'Connor, All in the Family) and his friends line the two up. Of course nobody knows that Grace has Bob's dead wife's heart (say that ten times fast!).Hunt plays Grace's best friend and steals virtually every scene she's in. She has five rambunctious children and a beer-drinking husband (James Belushi) who seems less mature than his kids do. While the scenes between Duchovny and Driver feel like an ode to Moonstruck, the scenes between Hunt and Belushi play more like a zany television sitcom. The can't get along, but we know they love each other a lot.My one complaint about the film is that Hunt should have taken the role of Grace. She nearly overshadows everybody in the film and although Minnie Driver is fine as Grace, she just isn't as charming as Bonnie Hunt. Any smart Hollywood director would pass on the Demi Moore's and Sharon Stone's and give Bonnie Hunt a chance to be a leading lady.The end of the film is a huge cliche, but the rest of the movie is so good it's forgivable. Original, witty, and charming, Return to Me sports great supporting performances by James Belushi, and Carroll O'Connor (among others). It's a fantastic movie that should please anyone with a taste for romance straight from the heart.

Grace (Minnie) is a heart transplant patient while Bob (David) is an architect married to the beautiful Elizabeth (Joely Richards). After an evening out for a fundraiser for Elizabeth's employer, the zoo, they are in a terrible accident.  Subsequently Elizabeth dies.  In the same hospital, Grace finally receives her heart transplant.The film skips to a year later where Bob is still grieving and Grace is learning to live for the first time as a healthy person, instead of perpetually sick.  Her friend Megan (Bonnie Hunt and her husband Joe (James Belushi) and their numerous kids are frequently seen with her and offer comic relief and advice.She eventually meets Bob at her grandfather's restaurant O'Reilly's.  The two are a hit from the start and the film shows much of their time together.  Between her nerves about her surgery and his memories of his wife, it isn't easy, but they find a comfortable relationship with each other.  When they hit a rough patch, she journeys to Italy and Bob realizes just how special she is to him.While its hard to go into great detail about this film without giving away how the story ends, I feel that it rates high with romantic comedies.The music is fantastic as I am a big Dean Martin fan.  The main song is what probably inspired the name of the movie.  The other music selections are tasteful as well and fit the theme of the time period in which Dean Martin was popular.I thought the roles were well cast and I've always been a fan of David Duchovony.  I was pleased to see the romantic side of him in this as he often plays more ""manly"" roles.While some might say that the plot is predictable it is only that way during the movie.  Outside of watching it I would say that the idea behind it is highly original.  I don't want to give away too much but it explores the thought that we are all connected in some way.This is one of my favorite movies.

486728,A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ,6306012389,"Mr. JKW ""jkw""","[7, 8]","""Return to Me"" is a sad but wonderful love story that follows the romance of widower Bob Rueland (David ""Agent Fox Mulder"" Duchovny) and Grace Briggs (Minnie Driver).THE STORY:Bob Rueland's life is turned upside down when he tragically and unexpectedly loses his zoologist wife in a traffic accident.  Meanwhile, terminally ill Grace Brigg's life is forever changed when at the last minute she reveals the heart transplant that saves her life.  Fast forward a year when Bob and Grace meet, not knowing that their lives are now forever entwined...THE COOL THINGS:Overall, like most love stories this movie unfolds very nicely.  In addition to the powerful story about the very nature of this romance the movie also contains a ""nice"" comedic side courtesy of the members of Grace's extended Irish-Italian-American family as well as Bob's friends.  In all, this is a perfectly safe and ""family-friendly"" movie with good, clean fun.THE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:Though a little sparse on DVD features compared to current standards, the offerings here though are a ""nice touch.""1. Feature length audio commentary by Director Bonnie Hunt and Co-Writer Don Lake:  Always an interesting listen.2. Music Video:  ""What If I Loved You"" by Joey Gian.  Nice3. One Deleted Scene:  Danny Boy.  Nice and funny bit with Grace's uncles, grandparents, etc crooning out that old tune.THE VERDICT:Admitted, the story is sad but the story is done nicely and the ending ties up everything nicely.  Overall, I'd say this is a perfect movie for a couple to curl up into on the couch for a nice evening viewing (be it bought or rented).",4,Great for a Quiet Night At Home&#65533;,1025308800,"06 29, 2002",2002,1605,"['Return', 'Me', 'sad', 'wonderful', 'love', 'story', 'romance', 'widower', 'Bob', 'Rueland', 'David', 'Agent', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'Duchovny', 'Grace', 'Briggs', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'STORY', 'Bob', 'Rueland', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'tragically', 'unexpectedly', 'zoologist', 'wife', 'traffic', 'accident', 'Meanwhile', 'terminally', 'ill', 'Grace', 'Brigg', 'life', 'forever', 'changed', 'when', 'last', 'minute', 'heart', 'transplant', 'life', 'Fast', 'forward', 'year', 'when', 'Bob', 'Grace', 'meet', 'not', 'knowing', 'lives', 'are', 'now', 'forever', 'entwined', 'COOL', 'THINGS', 'Overall', 'most', 'love', 'stories', 'movie', 'very', 'nicely', 'addition', 'powerful', 'story', 'very', 'nature', 'romance', 'movie', 'also', 'nice', 'comedic', 'side', 'courtesy', 'members', 'Grace', 'extended', 'Irish-Italian-American', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'Bob', 'friends', 'perfectly', 'safe', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'good', 'clean', 'fun.THE', 'DVD', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'little', 'sparse', 'DVD', 'features', 'compared', 'current', 'standards', 'offerings', 'here', 'are', 'nice', 'touch.', '1', 'Feature', 'length', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'Co-Writer', 'Don', 'Lake', 'interesting', 'listen.2', 'Music', 'Video', 'What', 'Loved', 'Joey', 'Gian', 'Nice3', 'One', 'Deleted', 'Scene', 'Danny', 'Boy', 'Nice', 'funny', 'bit', 'Grace', 'uncles', 'grandparents', 'etc', 'crooning', 'out', 'old', 'tune.THE', 'VERDICT', 'Admitted', 'story', 'sad', 'story', 'done', 'nicely', 'ending', 'ties', 'up', 'everything', 'nicely', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'perfect', 'movie', 'couple', 'curl', 'up', 'couch', 'nice', 'evening', 'viewing', 'be', 'bought', 'rented']",N/A

486734,A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ,6306012389,Nicholas Stix,"[10, 13]","(3 1/2 stars)This is a poignant, romantic comedy that works off the premise that the love of a good heart gone astray will triumph over all obstacles, and find its way back to where it belongs. And yet, in spite of its kitschy premise, this movie works.David Duchovny (X-Files) plays Chicago architect Bob Rueland, whose zoo-director wife, Elizabeth (Joely Richardson), was killed in a car crash. (Good! The establishing scenes at the beginning, that present the wife as beyond saintly, are the worst part of the film. Diabetics are warned that the first ten minutes may be dangerous to their health.) Minnie Driver is young, aspiring artist Grace Briggs, who will die, if she doesn't get a heart transplant. She gets Bob's late wife's heart.Bob grieves. His friends (most notably David Alan Grier, as zoo vet Charlie Johnson) grieve. His dog grieves. Even the ape at the zoo grieves.Meanwhile, Grace may have a heart, but she doesn't have a life. She waits tables for her Irish uncle, Marty O'Reilly (Carroll O'Connor), and his old friend, Angelo Pardipillo (Robert Loggia), at the Irish-Italian restaurant they own together. Grace's extended family tries to set her up, e.g., with a man who tends to lapse back into his former vocation as a priest.Meanwhile, Bob's friend Charlie sets him up with obnoxious blind dates that make grieving look like fun.Eventually, the stars cross paths, and -- some complications notwithstanding -- their lives are made new.But you know what? This movie is so much better than its synopsis. That's because its real star is Bonnie Hunt, the ubiquitous character actress who directed, co-wrote, and (if memory serves) co-produced the movie. (Though it doesn't say so at amazon.com's IMDB, I could have sworn Hunt's credits included producer, when I saw this as an in-flight movie.) Except for the first few minutes, Hunt often comes dangerously close to cloying sentimentality, without crossing the line.And while the chemistry between the stars is good, David Duchovny and Minnie Driver are no Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. Recognizing this, Hunt exquisitely cast a bevy of supporting roles that carry the movie, from David Alan Grier's skirt-chasing veterinarian, Charlie Johnson, to Chicago's own James Belushi, as working-class husband Joe Dayton (whose wife, Megan, is played by Hunt) to the old men of the restaurant (O'Connor, Loggia, Eddie Jones). She even gets dramatic mileage out of the animals. And any moviemaker who can come up with a good, sizeable role for Carroll O'Connor has something on the ball, in my book [this review was originally published in 2000, before O'Connor's death]. The highest compliment I can pay Bonnie Hunt the director, is that she doesn't waste a single scene or role.The other thing Hunt does well is to present two kinds of romance. There's the falling-in-love kind we expect from this sort of movie, as well as another kind you almost never see in pictures: the wry, wisecracking fell-in-love, stayed-in-love romance of Belushi and Hunt's Joe and Megan Dayton, who by now have a mess of kids.Hunt and her collaborator, Don Lake, came up with some good lines, and can be forgiven for taking the shtick from Norman Jewison's Moonstruck of using a Dean Martin song (""Return to Me"") as a running, romantic theme.Return to Me is a good choice for the date who's coming over to the house for the first time, or the ""date"" whose name has shared space on mailboxes with yours for many years.",3,Ya Gotta Have Heart,1051574400,"04 29, 2003",2003,3465,"['3', '1/2', 'stars', 'poignant', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'premise', 'love', 'good', 'heart', 'gone', 'astray', 'will', 'triumph', 'obstacles', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'where', 'yet', 'spite', 'kitschy', 'premise', 'movie', 'works.David', 'Duchovny', 'X-Files', 'Chicago', 'architect', 'Bob', 'Rueland', 'zoo-director', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'was', 'killed', 'car', 'crash', 'Good', 'establishing', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'present', 'wife', 'saintly', 'are', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'Diabetics', 'are', 'warned', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'may', 'be', 'dangerous', 'health', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'young', 'aspiring', 'artist', 'Grace', 'Briggs', 'who', 'will', 'die', ""n't"", 'get', 'heart', 'transplant', 'Bob', 'late', 'wife', 'heart.Bob', 'grieves', 'friends', 'most', 'notably', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'zoo', 'vet', 'Charlie', 'Johnson', 'grieve', 'dog', 'grieves', 'Even', 'ape', 'zoo', 'grieves.Meanwhile', 'Grace', 'may', 'have', 'heart', ""n't"", 'have', 'life', 'tables', 'Irish', 'uncle', 'Marty', ""O'Reilly"", 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'old', 'friend', 'Angelo', 'Pardipillo', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'Irish-Italian', 'restaurant', 'own', 'together', 'Grace', 'extended', 'family', 'tries', 'set', 'up', 'e.g.', 'man', 'who', 'lapse', 'back', 'former', 'vocation', 'priest.Meanwhile', 'Bob', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'up', 'obnoxious', 'blind', 'dates', 'make', 'grieving', 'look', 'fun.Eventually', 'stars', 'cross', 'paths', 'complications', 'notwithstanding', 'lives', 'are', 'made', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'synopsis', 'real', 'star', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'ubiquitous', 'character', 'actress', 'who', 'directed', 'co-wrote', 'memory', 'serves', 'co-produced', 'movie', ""n't"", 'say', 'so', 'amazon.com', 'IMDB', 'could', 'have', 'sworn', 'Hunt', 'credits', 'included', 'producer', 'when', 'saw', 'in-flight', 'movie', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Hunt', 'often', 'dangerously', 'close', 'cloying', 'sentimentality', 'crossing', 'line.And', 'chemistry', 'stars', 'good', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'are', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Recognizing', 'Hunt', 'exquisitely', 'cast', 'bevy', 'supporting', 'roles', 'carry', 'movie', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'skirt-chasing', 'veterinarian', 'Charlie', 'Johnson', 'Chicago', 'own', 'James', 'Belushi', 'working-class', 'husband', 'Joe', 'Dayton', 'wife', 'Megan', 'played', 'Hunt', 'old', 'men', 'restaurant', ""O'Connor"", 'Loggia', 'Eddie', 'Jones', 'even', 'dramatic', 'mileage', 'animals', 'moviemaker', 'who', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'good', 'sizeable', 'role', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'something', 'ball', 'book', '[', 'review', 'was', 'originally', 'published', '2000', ""O'Connor"", 'death', ']', 'highest', 'compliment', 'can', 'pay', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'director', ""n't"", 'waste', 'single', 'scene', 'role.The', 'other', 'thing', 'Hunt', 'well', 'present', 'two', 'kinds', 'romance', 'falling-in-love', 'kind', 'expect', 'sort', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'kind', 'almost', 'never', 'see', 'pictures', 'wry', 'wisecracking', 'fell-in-love', 'stayed-in-love', 'romance', 'Belushi', 'Hunt', 'Joe', 'Megan', 'Dayton', 'who', 'now', 'have', 'mess', 'kids.Hunt', 'collaborator', 'Don', 'Lake', 'came', 'up', 'good', 'lines', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'taking', 'shtick', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'Moonstruck', 'using', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'song', 'Return', 'Me', 'running', 'romantic', 'theme.Return', 'Me', 'good', 'choice', 'date', 'who', 'coming', 'house', 'first', 'time', 'date', 'name', 'shared', 'space', 'mailboxes', 'yours', 'many', 'years']",N/A

The plot fits into a nutshell (and is one of the most unsophisticated ones I've ever encountered): Bob's wife dies in a car-crash and her heart is transplanted to Grace. In a year Bob meets Grace and falls in love with her. Can you guess what hinders their happiness? Like J.Belushi's character justly noticed: &quot;His wife's heart? So what?&quot; I couldn't agree more with him, for taking into consideration the whole light tone of the movie, this obstacle does not seem to be serious. But that's the golden rule of a melodrama - there must be an obstacle for lovers to overcome.I usually dislike such illogical tear-jerkers, but this time I've enjoyed watching Duchovny and Driver interacting: Duchovny as handsome and charming Bob, sensitive and forlorn (all his emotions reflecting in his eyes), Driver as a simple and perplexed Grace, so desperately wanted to find her happiness. The movie is full of little funny and touching moments (thank God, no toilet humor, no nudity, no forced gags). However, the show is stolen by Grace's elderly grandmas and uncles, putting their efforts together to organize Grace's happiness: they have the best jokes and keep you smiling instantly, they give the movie its &quot;warm&quot; flavor. I'm adding one more star for their performance!And although I've rented this movie just to look at DD, the movie succeeds in reaching its goal: to show how love is born and how it transforms a man; that we all long for a family life with its sad and happy moments.

Bonnie Hunt has this habit of allowin very long pauses in the commentary track while she watches the movie, which has the volume turned dowm low because we are not supposed to be listening to the movie while you are supposed to speak, dear Bonnie.  Don Lake is almost non-existant in the commentary, allowing Bonnie to run the whole track.  There were many times when I wanted her to give insider information of what was happening, but her inside info was limited to telling which of her many relatives she cast in what roles.

The story takes place in Chicago and is about a man named Bob (played by hot David Duchovny) who is madly in love with his wife of 15 years.  She unexpectedly dies one evening in a car crash, which of course leaves him devasted and convinced he will never fall in love again.  About a year later he meets a young woman named Grace (played beautifully by Minnie Driver)who works as a waitress in her grandfather's restaurant. She has lived a very sheltered life due to her parents early death and her health problems.  She and Bob fall in love almost immediately when he comes into her restaurant one day while on a terrible blind date.  Grace and Bob date for several months.  Grace keeps a secret from him- she is too afraid of telling him she had a heart transplant for fear he will not be attracted to her once he sees her large scar.  She almost tells him one evening at his house but doesn't when she discovers his wife died on the day she received a new heart. I won't tell anymore about the rest of the film.  I don't want to spoil the ending.  This movie has no sex or violence which I appreciate.

486746,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6306012389,Reviewer,"[82, 84]","Director and co-writer Bonnie Hunt delivers the goods in ""Return To Me,"" a touching story of two deserving people who are afforded a second chance at  love and happiness.  When we meet Grace (Minnie Driver), she is suffering  with heart disease and awaiting a donor for a transplant.  Architect-builder Bob Rueland (David Duchovny) is happily married to  Elizabeth (Joely Richardson), they are deeply in love, and Hunt quickly  establishes just how perfect their lives are together; so perfect, in fact,  it becomes somewhat unsettling because you know that tragedy of some kind  or other is imminent.  When it comes, the transition is handled succinctly  and with the skill of a seasoned professional.  When Elizabeth dies, Grace  receives her heart.  A year later, Bob, still mourning the loss of his  wife, meets Grace at the Irish-Italian restaurant owned by her grandfather  (Carroll O'Connor), where she works as a waitress.  Neither are aware of  the intimate link they share to the heart that has given Grace her life.  In the hands of a less savvy director, the story at this point could easily  go astray and become mired in coincidence and cliche.  Hunt never comes  close to allowing this to happen, however, and instead hits every note  squarely on the head so that the plot fairly resonates with precision and  timing.  A veteran character actress herself (she plays Grace's closest  friend, Meg, here), she seems to know instinctively just when to add the  right light touch to offset the drama, then fleshes it all out with an  array of great characters,especially Robert Loggia, as Angelo, the  ""Greatest Italian chef in Chicago,"" and James Belushi as Meg's husband,  Joe.  There are no wasted moments in this film; the story moves right along  and takes you with it.  The dialogue is often witty and always real; in a  scene between Grace and Meg that takes place in the hospital (prior to  their notification that a donor has been located), in which Grace can  barely draw a breath, she looks up at Meg and says one word, ""Rosebud.""  After Elizabeth dies, when Bob finds himself alone at home and finally  breaks down, Hunt gives the scene time to build and play out, so that it  rings true instead of being glossed over and simply used as a tool to move  the story along.  When it happens we, as an audience, are also afforded  that time to realize the suffering he's experiencing, and it allows us to  feel it as well.  The scene in which Grace, Meg and Joe are at home  awaiting a dinner guest (a former priest), is beyond hilarious.  Highlighting an exceptional cast, David Duchovny and Minnie Driver are  unforgettable as Bob and Grace; and the multi-talented Bonnie Hunt rises to  a whole new level of artistic merit for giving us a truly memorable and  heart-warming movie that is a joy to experience.  Written by Hunt and Don  Lake, ""Return To Me"" is a delight from beginning to end, the kind of film  one waits for to come along.  Hopefully, in the future Hunt will treat us  to even more movies of this caliber.",5,An Absoulute Gem From Bonnie Hunt,965779200,"08 9, 2000",2000,3040,"['Director', 'co-writer', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'goods', 'Return', 'Me', 'touching', 'story', 'two', 'deserving', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'afforded', 'second', 'chance', 'love', 'happiness', 'When', 'meet', 'Grace', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'suffering', 'heart', 'disease', 'awaiting', 'donor', 'transplant', 'Architect-builder', 'Bob', 'Rueland', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'happily', 'married', 'Elizabeth', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'are', 'deeply', 'love', 'Hunt', 'quickly', 'just', 'how', 'perfect', 'lives', 'are', 'together', 'so', 'perfect', 'fact', 'somewhat', 'unsettling', 'know', 'tragedy', 'kind', 'other', 'imminent', 'When', 'transition', 'handled', 'succinctly', 'skill', 'seasoned', 'professional', 'When', 'Elizabeth', 'Grace', 'heart', 'year', 'later', 'Bob', 'still', 'mourning', 'loss', 'wife', 'Grace', 'Irish-Italian', 'restaurant', 'owned', 'grandfather', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'where', 'waitress', 'are', 'aware', 'intimate', 'link', 'share', 'heart', 'given', 'Grace', 'life', 'hands', 'less', 'savvy', 'director', 'story', 'point', 'could', 'easily', 'go', 'astray', 'become', 'mired', 'coincidence', 'cliche', 'Hunt', 'never', 'close', 'allowing', 'happen', 'however', 'instead', 'hits', 'note', 'squarely', 'head', 'plot', 'fairly', 'precision', 'timing', 'veteran', 'character', 'actress', 'Grace', 'closest', 'friend', 'Meg', 'here', 'know', 'instinctively', 'just', 'when', 'add', 'right', 'light', 'touch', 'offset', 'drama', 'then', 'out', 'array', 'great', 'characters', 'especially', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'Angelo', 'Greatest', 'Italian', 'chef', 'Chicago', 'James', 'Belushi', 'Meg', 'husband', 'Joe', 'are', 'wasted', 'moments', 'film', 'story', 'moves', 'right', 'along', 'dialogue', 'often', 'witty', 'always', 'real', 'scene', 'Grace', 'Meg', 'place', 'hospital', 'prior', 'notification', 'donor', 'been', 'located', 'Grace', 'can', 'barely', 'draw', 'breath', 'up', 'Meg', 'one', 'word', 'Rosebud', 'Elizabeth', 'dies', 'when', 'Bob', 'alone', 'home', 'finally', 'breaks', 'down', 'Hunt', 'scene', 'time', 'build', 'play', 'out', 'true', 'instead', 'being', 'glossed', 'simply', 'used', 'tool', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'When', 'audience', 'are', 'also', 'afforded', 'time', 'realize', 'suffering', 'experiencing', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'Grace', 'Meg', 'Joe', 'are', 'home', 'awaiting', 'dinner', 'guest', 'former', 'priest', 'hilarious', 'Highlighting', 'exceptional', 'cast', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'Bob', 'Grace', 'multi-talented', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'artistic', 'merit', 'giving', 'truly', 'memorable', 'heart-warming', 'movie', 'joy', 'experience', 'Written', 'Hunt', 'Don', 'Lake', 'Return', 'Me', 'delight', 'beginning', 'end', 'kind', 'film', 'one', 'waits', 'come', 'along', 'Hopefully', 'future', 'Hunt', 'will', 'treat', 'even', 'more', 'movies', 'caliber']",N/A

This has been a good movie year so far, or else I've just gotten really, really lucky with my choices. Bonnie Hunt wrote, produced, directed, and played a supporting role in this fifties movie translated with a nineties sensibility.Bob Rueland (Kalifornia's David Duchovny) is a widower who meets, and immediately falls in love with, Grace Briggs (Good Will Hunting's Minnie Driver), his waitress while he's on a blind date with possibly the most obnoxious woman ever to grace a film screen (played to the hilt by Holly Wortell, last seen &#60;surprise!&#62; in The Bonnie Hunt Show). And yes, I do remember Sandra Bernhard's aborted (thankfully) film career when I say that.Much of the movie's brilliance lies solidly in the fact that it IS a plot, and a pacing, straight out of the days when Jimmy Stewart and Mickey Rooney were playing romantic leads. It won't work if you really can't see Duchovny and Driver dating for so many months without jumping into bed, but both of them are quite capable of pulling it off, and they do with great style. Adding to the atmosphere is a wonderful ensemble cast, with Hunt and James Belushi as Diver's best friends, and Carroll O'Connor as her grandfather, half-owner (with Robert Loggia) of Chicago's only Irish-Italian restaurant.It's wonderful.

486756,A23AFVXWF9A0CF,6306012389,Sallie A. Neal,"[37, 38]","This is perhaps one of the most underrated movies I have ever seen.David Duchovny and Minnie Driver star as Gracie Briggs and Bob Rueland, two people who are brought together with more than fate, but also a heart.  When disaster and devastation hits Bob, he unselfishly donates his wife's organs.  Gracie is in desperate need for a heart after suffering for many years with heart disease. Her heart finally does come, at the most needed moment, and it is a special heart at that.It takes over a year for Bob to get back in the dating scene, and that's only with help from Charlie played by David-Alan Grier.  When the date lands them in Gracies grandfather's (Carroll O'Connor) restaurant, Gracie is their waitress, and it's love at first sight, and their lives will be forever changed.There is also great classic songs that sprinkle this movie with class and romance.  Songs like &quot;At Long Last Love&quot; by Frank Sinatra and &quot;Tenderly&quot; by Jackie Gleason finish the movie off without any hitches only adding more detail.  Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake take their first stab at writing, directing, and starring in Return To Me, and I must say it is one movie that reminds me the most of the classic romances of long ago.Please note that if you like this film, Bonnie and Don are writing and directing a tv show on ABC this fall, called Life With Bonnie.

486762,ANHGGQT4HTEK0,6306012389,Sonia,"[8, 11]","Return to Me is a romantic comedy about two people who almost magically cross paths.  Grace Briggs is a woman in need of a heart transplant, and after many years of waiting, she finally recieves a donor heart.The flip side is that the heart she had so waited for belonged to the young wife of Bob Rueland (David Duchovny), who died tragically as the result of an automobile accident they were in.Time goes forward, when Bob, a Chicago based architect and builder is working feverishly to complete the addition to the monkey house at Lincoln Park Zoo as was the dream of his late wife.  He has let his work consume him and attempted to use this project as a means of squelching the pain of losing her.Grace, has made a wonderful recovery and is continuing on with life as a normal, healthy adult but wonders why she feels so empty despite how fortunate she feels to be alive.  Her love of painting and her love for those around her cannot fill a void she feels in her life.You must know it's coming, Bob and Grace meet.  He is on a blind date his best friend, Charlie (David Alan Grier) arranged for him.  The date is going very badly but the bright spot is the beautiful waitress, Grace.  They feel an instant connection to each other that is absolutely enchanting.The rest of the movie follows along their relationship, from the first awkward conversations to a sincere and honest loving existence.  I don't want to spoil some of the more specific relationship developments, other than to say that I was pleasantly surprised they dated without having to immediately jump in the sack together.  Actually, she is able to conceal her heart transplant scar with relative ease, not worrying about him noticing it as the result of any hanky panky because there is none.  They kiss and they hold hands.  It makes you sigh the sigh of first love, remembering the times when your hand touched the hand of your loved one, and you felt that spark of electricity.Obviously, the romance between Grace and Bob is the primary storyline in Return to Me.  However, there are so many other funny and interesting characters in the story that support the main storyline, rather than detract from it.  Carroll O'Connor is Marty O'Reilly, Grace's grandpa and basically the only family she's got.  Other surrogate family members are the other people who work with them at O'Reilly's Italian restaurant.  An Irish Italian restaurant is a running joke in the movie.  It's a place where you can get some nice pasta and marinara sauce, and corned beef and cabbage.....all on the same plate.  Robert Loggia plays Angelo, the Italian cook at the restaurant and I'm not sure whether or not he is actual family to Grace or not, that was a little unclear.However, Angelo and Marty, along with two other surly old codgers named Wally and Emmett are the players in some of the funniest scenes of the movie.  After closing time, they sit around playing cards, drinking beer and having arguments about practically anything.The first such argument is best dead male singer.  It quickly becomes a debate about which ethnic group has the most notable singers.  They are shouting names at each other: Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Vic Damone, Frank Sinatra.  Then it becomes an argument about which singer beat up the most people.  It's a real gut buster, these guys are too funny.  Makes you wish you were a fly on the wall for every card game.Another funny storyline is the friendship Grace has with Megan (Bonnie Hunt) and Joe (James Belushi) who are the rattled parents of five kids, and portrayed, I'm here to say, in a manner somewhat mimicking what my own household might seem like.  Picking kids up off the floor, the yelling, the screaming, the occasional irrational exchanges all parents have with each other.  It's fun to laugh at that stuff happening to other people for once.  But, comparing apples to apples, this is the absolute best romantic comedy genre film I've seen in a very long time. Aside from some swearing, it is a G movie.  This one could have been made in the 1950s.  It is wholesome, sweet and a tad naive, just the things that make you forget some of the cynicism of the times we live in.  Return to Me forces you to take a simpler look at life, love and family.  How thankful you are to be alive, to have a heart beating in your chest.  How thankful you are for love, the love you have now, the love you had once, the love you have yet to know.  How thankful you are for family, both the family God gave you and the family members you chose for yourself in the friends that love you.",5,A Return to the endearing qualities of the 50s,971222400,"10 11, 2000",2000,4588,"['Return', 'Me', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'almost', 'magically', 'cross', 'paths', 'Grace', 'Briggs', 'woman', 'need', 'heart', 'transplant', 'many', 'years', 'waiting', 'finally', 'donor', 'heart.The', 'flip', 'side', 'heart', 'had', 'so', 'waited', 'belonged', 'young', 'wife', 'Bob', 'Rueland', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'who', 'died', 'tragically', 'result', 'automobile', 'accident', 'were', 'in.Time', 'forward', 'when', 'Bob', 'Chicago', 'based', 'architect', 'builder', 'working', 'feverishly', 'complete', 'addition', 'monkey', 'house', 'Lincoln', 'Park', 'Zoo', 'was', 'dream', 'late', 'wife', 'let', 'work', 'consume', 'attempted', 'use', 'project', 'means', 'squelching', 'pain', 'losing', 'her.Grace', 'made', 'wonderful', 'recovery', 'continuing', 'life', 'normal', 'healthy', 'adult', 'wonders', 'why', 'so', 'empty', 'how', 'fortunate', 'be', 'alive', 'love', 'painting', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'fill', 'void', 'life.You', 'must', 'know', 'coming', 'Bob', 'Grace', 'meet', 'blind', 'date', 'best', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'arranged', 'date', 'going', 'very', 'badly', 'bright', 'spot', 'beautiful', 'waitress', 'Grace', 'feel', 'instant', 'connection', 'other', 'absolutely', 'enchanting.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'along', 'relationship', 'first', 'awkward', 'conversations', 'sincere', 'honest', 'loving', 'existence', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'more', 'specific', 'relationship', 'developments', 'other', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'dated', 'having', 'immediately', 'jump', 'sack', 'together', 'Actually', 'able', 'conceal', 'heart', 'transplant', 'scar', 'relative', 'ease', 'not', 'worrying', 'noticing', 'result', 'hanky', 'panky', 'none', 'kiss', 'hold', 'hands', 'sigh', 'sigh', 'first', 'love', 'remembering', 'times', 'when', 'hand', 'touched', 'hand', 'loved', 'one', 'felt', 'spark', 'electricity.Obviously', 'romance', 'Grace', 'Bob', 'primary', 'storyline', 'Return', 'Me', 'However', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'funny', 'interesting', 'characters', 'story', 'main', 'storyline', 'rather', 'detract', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'Marty', ""O'Reilly"", 'Grace', 'grandpa', 'basically', 'only', 'family', 'got', 'Other', 'surrogate', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'work', ""O'Reilly"", 'Italian', 'restaurant', 'Irish', 'Italian', 'restaurant', 'running', 'joke', 'movie', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'nice', 'pasta', 'marinara', 'sauce', 'corned', 'beef', 'cabbage', '..all', 'same', 'plate', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'Angelo', 'Italian', 'cook', 'restaurant', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'not', 'actual', 'family', 'Grace', 'not', 'was', 'little', 'unclear.However', 'Angelo', 'Marty', 'two', 'other', 'surly', 'old', 'codgers', 'named', 'Wally', 'Emmett', 'are', 'players', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'closing', 'time', 'sit', 'playing', 'cards', 'drinking', 'beer', 'having', 'arguments', 'practically', 'anything.The', 'first', 'such', 'argument', 'best', 'dead', 'male', 'singer', 'quickly', 'debate', 'ethnic', 'group', 'most', 'notable', 'singers', 'are', 'shouting', 'names', 'other', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Sammy', 'Davis', 'Jr.', 'Vic', 'Damone', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Then', 'argument', 'singer', 'beat', 'up', 'most', 'people', 'real', 'gut', 'buster', 'guys', 'are', 'too', 'funny', 'Makes', 'wish', 'were', 'fly', 'wall', 'card', 'game.Another', 'funny', 'storyline', 'friendship', 'Grace', 'Megan', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'Joe', 'James', 'Belushi', 'who', 'are', 'rattled', 'parents', 'five', 'kids', 'portrayed', ""'m"", 'here', 'say', 'manner', 'somewhat', 'mimicking', 'what', 'own', 'household', 'might', 'seem', 'Picking', 'kids', 'up', 'floor', 'yelling', 'screaming', 'occasional', 'irrational', 'exchanges', 'parents', 'have', 'other', 'fun', 'laugh', 'stuff', 'happening', 'other', 'people', 'once', 'comparing', 'apples', 'apples', 'absolute', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genre', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Aside', 'swearing', 'G', 'movie', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', '1950s', 'wholesome', 'sweet', 'tad', 'naive', 'just', 'things', 'make', 'forget', 'cynicism', 'times', 'live', 'Return', 'Me', 'forces', 'take', 'simpler', 'look', 'life', 'love', 'family', 'How', 'thankful', 'are', 'be', 'alive', 'have', 'heart', 'beating', 'chest', 'How', 'thankful', 'are', 'love', 'love', 'have', 'now', 'love', 'had', 'once', 'love', 'have', 'yet', 'know', 'How', 'thankful', 'are', 'family', 'family', 'God', 'gave', 'family', 'members', 'chose', 'friends', 'love']",N/A

The  relationship with Duchovny and Driver was plausible, as they exhibited  ample chemistry.  I was disappointed that they spent all the hair &amp;  makeup budget on Minnie - Duchovny hardly had access to a comb for the  entire film.  I guess I'm just used to seeing him coiffed up in the  X-Files.  Anyway, it's a touching film with a great soundtrack.

I do not have a better word other than saying it is simply &quot;delightful&quot;. I think it is so sad that more people did not go to the theaters and see this film because it is one of the very best romantic comedies I have ever seen.There was a review written by a gentlemen that I read that discussed David Duchovny's acting ability in this movie. That gentleman was wrong. Duchovny is wonderful in this role and he does a crying seen like I have never seen before. He had to really be crying because you could just feel the emotion. It was heartbreaking. Now maybe I am alittle sappy sometimes but his acting was a very nice change from Mulder on the X-Files and he did a remarkable job with this character. Duchovny is a fine actor and his range shone through in this character. The chemistry he shared with Minnie Driver was wonderful. They made a very sweet couple that you so wanted their relationship to work out. The thing I really liked about this movie was the atmosphere of family and the humor that surrounded it. When Driver comes downstairs to cover her flowers from the cold and she has a showercap on her head and she is in a robe and then Duchovny stands up and she realizes who it is ...the look on her face is priceless. This is definitely a situation that could really happen and they did it with such flair. Minnie is very funny in the film and Bonnie Hunt just goes without saying. Her and her husbands characters added even more laughter to the film. They were both just hilarious. Carroll O'Conner played a sweet loveable grandfather anyone would be proud to have. Also this movie is one that the whole family can watch together or a great movie to watch alone and just get so involved with the characters. Women will fall in love with Duchovny and men will fall in love with Driver. You will cheer at the end and walk away very satisfied. I can't wait to add it to my movie collection. It will be money worth spending.

Unlike many Chicago-based films, this one is actually filmed there, and makes great use of locations like the Lincoln Park Zoo that anyone familiar with the city will recognize. There is a music video, deleted scene, and director's commentary (but no trailer) in the special features on this DVD from MGM. The death and heart transplant subplot proves more mystical than cornball, lending a spiritual air to a film already tinged with Irish and Italian Catholic imagery. Duchovny and Driver aren't the strongest romantic leads in film history, but their romantic chemistry is sweet and realistic. The scenes of family life and dating have a realistic feeling that makes it feel like you're watching real Chicagoans here. The only drawback to the film is that its plot is a bit boilerplate, being a very pleasant viewing experience without being terribly original or memorable.
