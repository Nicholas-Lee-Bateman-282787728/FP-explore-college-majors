1353855,A3P8H2VFQ5K605,B003M05KUA,Dr. Morbius,"[0, 0]","While ""Summer Lover"" is by no means a profound motion picture, I found it to be intriguing for several reasons: First, it advocates a free, sensual pagan lifestyle which is fascinating to consider and explore; and second, it challenges (even mocks) Christian beliefs which condemn free love and a diversity of human sexual expression. Yes, it's all rather badly acted, but there are moments and some good lines of script. The production values are strong and the geography is expertly used to illustrate the theme. The two women performers--who play bisexual lovers--are very attractive (the 'eye candy' aspect of this movie is worth men taking a peek).It is an uninhibited erotic fantasy you might like to share and discuss with a lover--if you dare to open this Pandora's Box!",3,Lessons from Lesbos,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,778,"['Summer', 'Lover', 'profound', 'motion', 'picture', 'found', 'be', 'intriguing', 'several', 'reasons', 'First', 'free', 'sensual', 'pagan', 'lifestyle', 'fascinating', 'consider', 'explore', 'second', 'even', 'mocks', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'condemn', 'free', 'love', 'diversity', 'human', 'sexual', 'expression', 'Yes', 'rather', 'badly', 'acted', 'are', 'moments', 'good', 'lines', 'script', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'strong', 'geography', 'expertly', 'used', 'illustrate', 'theme', 'two', 'women', 'performers', 'who', 'play', 'bisexual', 'lovers', 'are', 'very', 'attractive', ""'eye"", 'candy', 'aspect', 'movie', 'worth', 'men', 'taking', 'peek', '.It', 'uninhibited', 'erotic', 'fantasy', 'might', 'like', 'share', 'discuss', 'lover', 'dare', 'open', 'Pandora', 'Box']",Summer Lover

The delay of release in the US should tell you something about the quality of the film - it's only okay.With the title ""Sappho"" you know where this film is going. In case you don't Sappho was an Ancient Greek woman who is supposed to be the first celibrated lesbian. In fact she was from the island of Lesbos and her island's name gave us the term lesbian.Set in the 1920s, Avalon Barrie plays Sappho who is recently married to Phil (Todd Soley).

But even then, the editing and really cheesy music ruined the few sultry scenes.The story follows almost identically toHemingway's Garden of Eden, right down to the change in hair color and forced performances. The two ladies are very attractive and decently perform the outdoor love scenes, but the main story has been played out so many times with the newlywed couple throwing some flair their way by adding a third party while living in a beautiful locale (Lesbos shoreline) - but this one fell short in providing a talented re-telling. The inevitable drama unfolds and that ending leaves you with a wasted-time feeling.The filming style and editing are quite poor, the sound was obviously dubbed in later and the musical score was distracting and out of place. The scenery is gorgeous and deserves a high definition treatment, but Phase 4 does not do Blu. Normally I would not focus on the skin angle, but many of my lesbian customers have asked about this title in anticipation, and that really seems to be the only positive point of the film (as the actresses' shared scenes are tasteful, graphic and sensual - but even then the filmmakers tried splicing in nature footage and failed). The cover art front and back tried to sell this title on the main love scene, but they obviously had to paint over certain body parts and the result is even cheesier than the film.No special features, the 5.1 is used intermittently and the picture quality is below average to sometimes decent.

1353863,A2MF0N72JVXDAP,B003M05KUA,The Phantom,"[2, 3]","Wow, what a colossal waste of time and money this was. Not sexy enough to be erotica, and not inspired enough to be artistic, this was one of the  most disappointing movies that I've ever purchased. If you stumbled onto this (as I did) while seeking soft-core pornography or adult-themed art, don't believe reviews that rate ""Summer Lover"" high in either category. In fact the first adjective that I can think of to describe it is ""dull.""Any movie stamped ""unrated"" across its cover very clearly has been produced to appeal to those who watch erotica, but this thing gets so bogged down in its own pretentiousness that it takes half an hour before it gets to even a brief flash of nudity. And I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that the sex scenes are this movies only redeemable quality--nay, even those are no exception, for they show far too little and get by on rambunctiousness. The bedroom scenes in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" were sexier. And what was up with the aerial photography? I just got the feeling when watching this that the director thinks that his %$^@ doesn't stink.If there is an appealing part of this movie, it would have to be the scenery--which is, actually, quite stunning.",2,"""Unrated""?
