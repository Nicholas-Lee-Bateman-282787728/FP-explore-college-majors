The animation was the best I have ever seen. Best in the sense of the detail of the characters. You know how in almost all animation and most movies, you never feel the extras or even minor characters have lives when they are not onscreen. I felt the characters in Rango did. There was soo much detail, both in characterization but also visually, down to the texture of their skin, as much as, more than in HD movies of real people. Each character seemed fully realized.The plot was unsurprising but the characters and animation carry it along. It got a little slow in the middle but then picks up again and runs pretty fast to end.I also felt that the inspiration was the fairy tale of the Valiant Tailor who killed seven flies with one blow, made himself a sash that said ""Seven at One Blow"" and became a hero based on his lie, just as Rango (I don't remember if we ever learn his real name) becomes a hero based on his lie that he killed 7 with one bullet. Just as the tailor tricks two giants into fighting, so Rango tricks his two enemies into fighting.The bankrobbing, bat riding bandits were so great I wanted them to be on Rango's side. Their scene was as exciting as any action scene in, say, Indiana Jones.Depp was great as Rango. You can see the patterning of his action in Rango's animation.

1372170,AW85VDASDM8VU,B003Y5H53S,Amazon Customer,"[15, 19]","It's a puzzle!  It's like a big ol' mammogram.That's what we call a malapropism and it's the backbone of Rango (2011).  I love a pun.  Preferably a pun that is as close to the ""intended"" word as possible-orange in ""orange you glad I didn't say banana"" sounds nothing like ""aren't"" while mammogram does sound like anagram.  Puns aren't all Rango has to offer, it does physical comedy, poop jokes, and much much more.  It's flat out hilarious.A chameleon (Johnny Depp) is without an identity.  He does some acting, has a one act play, and a musical he's working on, but still he can't quite answer that old existential quandry-who am I?  After ""an ironic, unexpected event, propel[s] the hero"" onto the highway and into the city of Dirt, an improvisational response to an awkward bar scene gives him a name, Rango, and a colorful history.  Soon, as is wont to happen, he's sheriff of this dusty old town with the tycoon turtle (Ned Beatty) as its mayor and he's got a mystery on his hands-there's a water shortage and we aren't sure what's causing it.  Beans (Isla Fisher) knows there's been some water being dumped in the desert, but she can't figure it.  Off they go to find the answer, but our villains are crafty and Rango has to find out who he really is.""Is this heaven?"" asks Rango.  ""If it were we'd be eating Pop Tarts with Kim Novak,"" replies the Spirit of the West (Timothy Olyphant).The dialogue is great, but the soundtrack is wonderful.  Finally, a movie that has a pitch-perfect sense of music.  Perhaps this is in major part due to its magpie collection of the best sounds westerns have offered.  I flatter myself that I heard Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), The Magnificent Seven (1960), and obviously Ride of the Valkyries, to my infinite pleasure they played for longer than ten seconds.  But I almost cheered when they played Harmonica's Theme at the climax of the movie.  Chills, just thinking about it (well, thinking about it to the youtube link I just put there-DIE SOPA DIE!).  It's a travesty that the song Rango didn't get nominated for Best Original Song, but I imagine that particular category has seen more travesty than equity in its existence.Oh yeah, this is an animated movie.  Freaking amazing animation.  It's dry and realistic.  The sun burns into your eyes to show that it's pretty hot in the desert.  Rango, which they obviously put the time into, is a scalychameleon but he doesn't glisten like a dinosaur in Jurassic Park (1993)-after all, it's raining at the park, but it's dry in the desert.  This bad boy's getting all ten on IMDB.  At the climax, I did want some heavily repeated close-ups on the eyes of the duelists, but hey, you can't get everything.This movie was made (with others, I'm sure) by Gore Verbinski who is responsible for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) and the two pale imitations-but not the worst offender, at least.  He's also doing the Lone Ranger movie slated for 2013.  Not a devotee of the Ranger, I hadn't invested that much emotion into the idea of its success or failure, but whatever doubts I had have evaporated after seeing Rango.  Verbinski is well versed in the western-or at least its greatest incarnations-but should stop fooling around and bring John Logan in to rewrite the thing.  Looking at Logan's credits makes my jaw drop.  Some crap, to be sure, but a number of excellent films including the upcoming Bond movie, Skyfall.  Hehehehe.  That's how I feel right now.Drawbacks?  Hmm.  Let's see...  None.  Go see it, go buy it.  Now.

I spit on Nickeloden for even thinking of producing something like this.It begins with a lizard in a tank acting out scenarios he wrote with the few props available in his tank ome of which is the naked bust of a headless barbie doll. Just arms and chest no head or legs. ( Not cool).  Eventually the car he's in hits a rough patch and his tank falls out, breaking upon impact.  Thhus his adventure begins. Afteer disgustingly shedding two layers of skin he meets and speaks with a dying piece of roadkill that has been plowed in half by a car.  its complete with tiremarks and shiny raw wounds.  The kids weren't laughing, the adults weren't laughing. I couldn't finish my popcorn.So the lizard walks out into the desert and comes upon a town full of animals. He walks into the Saloon and asks for a glass of water only to be laughed at. (That's the conflict. the town is experiencing a drought.)  He is handed catus juice instead and  teased by one of the Saloon's occupants before being asked his name, which he talkes fron the bottle. Thanks to his practice in the tank he's able to pull of the persona of a cowboy quite well.  What happens next?  the profanity starts.Yep. From then on they use the word ""Hell"" in and out of context  throughout the film and even top it off with the D word near the en we've got  everything from:""Go to H*ll!!!.""""I'll drag your soul down to H*ll.""""H*ll, I'll blah blah blah blah blah....""Not for kids.

An example of this is the turkey with an arrow going all the way through his right eye  to the back of his head.The mole woith no eyes and a droopy nose and several others.  The only character that grew on me throughout the film was  Rattlesnake Jake. but even he isn't above the many flaws of this film. What was really unrealistic  about him is the fact that  his tale is the barrel of a gun  instead of a rattle.  I can understand the fact that the whole film is unrealistic  in several ways but that just didn't sit well with me, How on earth  would a creature without hands get the barrel of  a gun on his tale let alone be able to reload it???? what a design flaw.Overall do not take your kids to see this movie.

1372196,ALC3LG8YTNHU3,B003Y5H53S,"Bruce Barker ""Risingsnow""","[23, 40]","There are a lot of 5 star ratings for this film, even when you don't count the bot-critics and family/friends of the production crew.There are also a lot of reviews up and down the star-ratings that make nasty comments toward parents that are offended by Rango's content. Fair enough. However...1 It was marketed toward children and is even a featured trailer on other animated kid-flicks coming out on home video.2 It was created by a Viacom division that once used the tagline - ""Finally, kids have a channel of their own.""3 It IS an animated film that is based on and pays homage to numerous ""R"" rated films, not the least of which is the iconic ""Chinatown,"" but was never to my knowledge presented as such to the public.4 Amazon's own flagship review warns that the movie is too much for children under the age of 10.Yes, ""Rango"" received a ""PG"" rating, but considering the content, it presses its nose up against the window of ""PG-13"" fairly frequently. The parents expressing concern have a valid reason for warning other parents and don't need, to quote at least one other review,to ""get over it."" I too am a parent, but my 6 ""kids"" are all over 18. I bought this film for my wife and I because we are both huge fans of animation as art and ""Rango"" looked different than anything else I'd seen outside of Pixar.But, even though I ""got"" the ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" moment, the ""Chinatown"" and ""Hang 'Em High"" Eastwood homages as well as numerous others, that doesn't mean I felt they were story-appropriate or well executed. Many of the nudge-and-wink references so common in modern films are placed to provide a smile to the cinephiles in the audience. This was even true in adult fare such as in the ""Scream"" films. None of the ones in ""Rango"" will mean a thing to the target demographic. Part of Pixar's immense success is because they have mastered the art of making films children love, but have enough intelligent references to ensure that viewers of all ages will find something to enjoy.  But as so often happens in Hollywood, the filmmakers here have stolen the style of Pixar (and at least visually, in some ways improved upon it) but none of the substance.There are reasons this film deserves only 2 stars for me:1. Numerous people have mentioned the usage of minor cursing in the film. To me that isn't a big deal when compared to the copious amount of sexual references in the film. Calling them ""huevos"" or ""mangos"" instead of testes and breasts doesn't mean the terms won't be understood, nor is it coy and cute.2. It's extremely racist to resurrect an old latina prostitute and pimp joke even if you subtly change the phrasing to ""you want to kiss my seester?"" from the standard (and unprintable) punchline.3. Our society (translate that to the children that will BECOME society) is constantly bombarded with sex and violence. As a result, by the time the average child is 10 years old he or she will have witnessed over 50 thousand violent deaths, and that's just from television. I'm no puritan, but such fare is fun for adults that know the difference between reality and fantasy, not pre-adolescent children. Our kids get desensitized to sexuality and violence by films exactly like ""Rango.""4. A rattlesnake with a gatling gun for a tail and bullet belts in lieu of half its scales? That's not creativity, it's laziness.5. There are so many slow spots in the film that the pacing of the movie more closely resembles a slow crawl than a ""pace.""6. If I wanted a largely humorless and grim cartoon I would have thrown in my copy of Akira or any of the assorted other anime films I own or have seen.I elevated this rating to 2 stars because it incorporates several recent developments in digital animation and the overall look of the ""cinematography"" is simply amazing to see. But the reasons I listed above, as well as the fact that asking Gore Verbinski to direct a children's film is like asking Dr. Seuss to rewrite the script for a ""Silence of the Lambs"" remake are valid. Finally, the so-called ""never before seen ending"" and many of the deleted scenes change very little from the released version of the film - in some cases only a single word or two variance. I would only recommend this film to insomniacs with no elementary school-age children. It's has a brilliant vision, but fails utterly in delivery and execution. I also caution potential customers with small kids. The complaints that myself and others have mentioned regarding how boring and/or inapropriate this movie is for the target crowd are not the mere ravings of a bunch of conservative zealots.

This movie is an original story without a Pixar/Disney formula driving it.  It has a lot of smart & slaptick humor in it with comic commentary.EASTER EGGs.  An Easter egg is something hidden in a game/movie/media that is a link to another game/movie/media.VOICE ACTING.  Johnny Depp is outstanding as RANGO.

1372202,A3VP5SXUTKJFRW,B003Y5H53S,"C. DeGhoul ""urieldewolf""","[4, 7]","Please let it be known, this movie will not be to everyone's taste. Though children will likely enjoy the odd characters, the fart jokes, etc., the much of the humor and subtlety of the movie is aimed at a more mature audience, but an audience who also knows how to relish a little irreverance that's included with every tip-of-the-hat. (Oddly, I liken it to someone giving a respecful bow... but giving a little 'whiff' while doing so. I know that sounds odd but I think those who ""get"" this movie will understand. lol)As one reviewer pointed out (though in less kindly terms), the characters are not exactly what you would call conventionally beautiful. So if you're the type who judge people by their appearance instead of who they are and what is in their hearts, then this movie might make you uncomfortable. For those who enjoy a little stab at conventionalism, I think you'll enjoy its offbeat characters and humor.This movie is a oddball celebration of movies from the old ""spaghetti westerns"" to - believe it or not - Star Trek and everything in between. It's the most incredibly detailed, lusciously rendered computer animation I have ever seen so far. The characters, the settings... they're flawless. From every tiny twitch of Rango's eyes, the miniscule motions of his nostrils, the grains of sand trickling down the face of a dune, the liquid glisten and depth of Priscilla's eyes right down to the way they glow when the light hits them obliquely... It's magnificent work. It's very easy to forget you're watching characters that only exist inside a computer (or a bank of super-computers.) I've seen live action movies with less solidity, less reality than this animated one.Animation that is jaw-droppingly rich and detailed will only get you so far, however. To really bring an computer animated movie alive, you need actors who have 'good voice.' This movie excells in that too. The voices add so much depth, are so perfect for their characters, that I could watch this movie again and again. And have. Three times so far and counting.I could gush on about it but it will be of no use. Not everyone will 'get' the humor, the oddball characters, the multitude of film references or be able to appreciate the love and labor that was required to create this movie. I think this movie will endure the same way 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' has. I can envision groups of film buff friends gathering around to watch it together and joyfully debate which movies are being referenced when.As an example of the offbeat humor, please allow me to quote a piece of it. Wounded Crow is the film's Western stereoptype of a Native American. Naturally, he's asked to guide the possum... err... posse upon their quest. Wounded Crow points with his crutch into the distance and says, ""Pick up trail. Three men, headed west. One blind. One with..."" He sniffs the air. ""...enlarged prostate, riding side saddle."" And that, dear readers, is a good example of the tongue-in-cheek humor that seasons this gorgeously rendered, delightfully irreverant, offbeat movie.P.S. For those who haven't yet found the blatant Star Trek reference, it is easier to spot if you can freeze-frame the movie. I don't want to ruin the fun of finding it for yourselves (if you haven't already) but if you have trouble finding it, I'll give another clue in the comments section of this review.",5,"Silliness, wit, and gorgeous animation",1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,3371,"['Please', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'children', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'odd', 'characters', 'fart', 'jokes', 'etc.', 'much', 'humor', 'subtlety', 'movie', 'aimed', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'audience', 'who', 'also', 'how', 'relish', 'little', 'irreverance', 'included', 'tip-of-the-hat', 'Oddly', 'liken', 'someone', 'giving', 'respecful', 'bow', 'giving', 'little', ""'whiff"", 'doing', 'so', 'know', 'odd', 'think', 'who', 'get', 'movie', 'will', 'understand', 'lol', 'one', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'less', 'kindly', 'terms', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'conventionally', 'beautiful', 'So', ""'re"", 'type', 'who', 'judge', 'people', 'appearance', 'instead', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'hearts', 'then', 'movie', 'might', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'who', 'enjoy', 'little', 'stab', 'conventionalism', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'offbeat', 'characters', 'humor.This', 'movie', 'oddball', 'celebration', 'movies', 'old', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'believe', 'not', 'Star', 'Trek', 'everything', 'most', 'incredibly', 'detailed', 'lusciously', 'rendered', 'computer', 'animation', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'characters', 'settings', ""'re"", 'flawless', 'tiny', 'twitch', 'Rango', 'eyes', 'miniscule', 'motions', 'nostrils', 'grains', 'sand', 'trickling', 'down', 'face', 'dune', 'liquid', 'glisten', 'depth', 'Priscilla', 'eyes', 'right', 'down', 'way', 'glow', 'when', 'light', 'hits', 'obliquely', 'magnificent', 'work', 'very', 'easy', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'characters', 'only', 'exist', 'computer', 'bank', 'super-computers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'less', 'solidity', 'less', 'reality', 'animated', 'one.Animation', 'jaw-droppingly', 'rich', 'detailed', 'will', 'only', 'get', 'so', 'far', 'however', 'really', 'bring', 'computer', 'animated', 'movie', 'alive', 'need', 'actors', 'who', 'have', ""'good"", 'voice', 'movie', 'too', 'voices', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'are', 'so', 'perfect', 'characters', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'again', 'have', 'Three', 'times', 'so', 'far', 'counting.I', 'could', 'gush', 'will', 'be', 'use', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', ""'get"", 'humor', 'oddball', 'characters', 'multitude', 'film', 'references', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'love', 'labor', 'was', 'required', 'create', 'movie', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'endure', 'same', 'way', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'can', 'envision', 'groups', 'film', 'buff', 'friends', 'gathering', 'around', 'watch', 'together', 'joyfully', 'debate', 'movies', 'are', 'being', 'referenced', 'example', 'offbeat', 'humor', 'please', 'allow', 'quote', 'piece', 'Wounded', 'Crow', 'film', 'Western', 'stereoptype', 'Native', 'American', 'Naturally', 'asked', 'guide', 'possum', 'err', 'posse', 'quest', 'Wounded', 'Crow', 'points', 'crutch', 'distance', 'Pick', 'up', 'trail', 'Three', 'men', 'headed', 'west', 'One', 'blind', 'One', 'air', 'enlarged', 'prostate', 'riding', 'side', 'saddle', 'dear', 'readers', 'good', 'example', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'humor', 'seasons', 'gorgeously', 'rendered', 'delightfully', 'irreverant', 'offbeat', 'movie.P.S', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'found', 'blatant', 'Star', 'Trek', 'reference', 'easier', 'spot', 'can', 'freeze-frame', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'fun', 'finding', 'yourselves', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'trouble', 'finding', ""'ll"", 'give', 'clue', 'comments', 'section', 'review']",N/A

I was partly right.This movie had some whimsy. It had some funny. And to an extent, my kids enjoyed it. In many senses, I felt like this movie was straddling the fence between ""adult"" and ""child"" and had a hard time planting itself adequately for either audience.Johnny Depp's caricature gecko character of Rango is rather humorous. But a lot of his humor is drawn from Depp's personality or from jokes and allusions that would go over the heads of younger kids.While I definitely applaud kid's movies for having ""inside jokes"" geared to make the adults laugh, I feel like they should be subtle enough to not bother or bore the kids. Portions of this movie included sort of existential moments where Rango is searching for the purpose of life or some definition of who he truly is. In some of these moments, the writing and plot are definitely over the head of younger kids.We watched this with a dozen kids ranging from 2 to 12 and each of them wandered in and out of the room bored with the movie. There were some stretches where no kids were interested anymore and we had to call them back in when some cartoony action reappeared. Some of the kids were also taken back by the swearing in the film. There wasn't a ton, but there was enough that it was noticeable and off-putting for a kids cartoon.I laughed at a number of segments in this movie and I found it generally pretty fun, but as an overall package, it didn't seem to deliver. I blame most of that on the fact that it was unable to find its true audience because it didn't know who its audience was.2.5 out of 5 stars",2,I liked it...but who is it for?,1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,1694,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Rango', 'seemed', 'whimsically', 'funny', 'kids', 'movie', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'kids', 'was', 'partly', 'right.This', 'movie', 'had', 'whimsy', 'had', 'funny', 'extent', 'kids', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'senses', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'straddling', 'fence', 'adult', 'child', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'planting', 'adequately', 'audience.Johnny', 'Depp', 'caricature', 'gecko', 'character', 'Rango', 'rather', 'humorous', 'lot', 'humor', 'drawn', 'Depp', 'personality', 'jokes', 'allusions', 'would', 'go', 'heads', 'younger', 'kids.While', 'definitely', 'applaud', 'kid', 'movies', 'having', 'inside', 'jokes', 'geared', 'make', 'adults', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'subtle', 'enough', 'not', 'bother', 'bore', 'kids', 'Portions', 'movie', 'included', 'sort', 'existential', 'moments', 'where', 'Rango', 'searching', 'purpose', 'life', 'definition', 'who', 'truly', 'moments', 'writing', 'plot', 'are', 'definitely', 'head', 'younger', 'kids.We', 'watched', 'dozen', 'kids', 'ranging', '2', '12', 'wandered', 'room', 'bored', 'movie', 'were', 'stretches', 'where', 'kids', 'were', 'interested', 'anymore', 'had', 'call', 'back', 'when', 'cartoony', 'action', 'reappeared', 'kids', 'were', 'also', 'taken', 'back', 'swearing', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'ton', 'was', 'enough', 'was', 'noticeable', 'off-putting', 'kids', 'cartoon.I', 'laughed', 'number', 'segments', 'movie', 'found', 'generally', 'pretty', 'fun', 'overall', 'package', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'deliver', 'blame', 'most', 'fact', 'was', 'unable', 'find', 'true', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'audience', 'was.2.5', '5', 'stars']",N/A

It's released by Nickelodeon, stars Johnny Depp, who tends to be rather feast or famine, and is an animated film that's not made by Pixar. Due to that latter fact, the probability of it sucking hard went up by, oh, about 300%. So imagine my surprise when I went in and actually liked the movie!Rango stars Depp as the title character, a chameleon who finds himself lost in the middle of the Nevada desert. A kindly, if somewhat odd, armadillo (Alfred Molina), sets him on a course that takes him to the town of Dirt. The town, which is lifted directly out of every old West movie ever made, is populated entirely by animals, uses water as a currency, has a massive water shortage, and a shortage of living sheriffs. Next thing you know, Rango has ridden to the post of sheriff on a pack of lies and finds himself stuck in the middle of something bigger than he'd expected.There was a lot to enjoy about this movie. It's really one of the funnier comedies I've seen in a long time (and made for adults as well as kids. I doubt many eight-year-olds would appreciate Hunter S Thompson), and it's a movie that clearly knows its cinematic history (just wait until you see the Spirit of the Old West). It's also astonishingly lovely to look at. I compare the CGI in this with, say, Shrek, and the distance we've come in just a few years is really breathtaking. There were several points where I would have sworn the animals were muppets rather than CGI. They really looked good, as did the desert landscape.Sure, I'll be the first to admit that much about the movie doesn't make any real sense, like why would there be talking animals setting up a town in the desert in a world that clearly includes humans? Why would said town be based on the old west when the movie is set in modern times? How did they manage to have things like shotguns and a Bible? But frankly I was able to ignore all that because the movie really was amazingly good!So if you're looking for a little time to kill this weekend, go see this film.

This is a beautifully animated, often very funny film that isn't really meant for young kids - though its marketing campaign would seem to have suggested otherwise. (Well, that, and the overall American sentiment that animated films must be for kids - a perception due in no small part to Disney and to years of kid-orientated marketing for mainstream animated films).  Having read through some of the lukewarm to outright negative reviews, I've concluded that this marketing misstep is really the root cause for the 3 1/2 star average rating.  People went into the theater with their kids expecting one  thing, got quite another, and left (understandably) feeling a little ticked off.So, bear in mind: adults, you may really like this film if you can appreciate a little dark humor (there's a joke about road kill that, while not overly graphic - and while I found it funny - might be a bit much for a little kid), and if you have an understanding of some basic Hollywood (and literary) archetypes, which this film often sends up.  You may also appreciate this one if you admire beautiful animation.  (And this one *is* beautifully animated - perhaps the most visually beautiful computer animated flick that I've seen outside of `Wall-E.'  Here's a case where Blu-Ray is a blessing.)Kids, however, may not get this flick, and may even be left a bit bored and/or confused.

It's hands down the best movie I've seen from 2011's early line up and it's going to be a heavy contender for the Oscar in the best animated feature category. It's marvelous.The tremendous Johnny Depp stars as the voice of a very likeable chameleon by the name of Rango. Rango's head is slightly misshapen with one eye bulging out at an obscure angel and he wears only a red and white Hawaiian shirt.He often fantasizes of being a hero as is shown through comedic scenes of him acting out plays with lifeless friends that live with him in his little world. Yep, life is pretty dull as a pet in a glass cage; that is until an automobile accident literally shatters his entire world and leaves him stranded on the side of a desert strewn road.Thirsty for adventure, he sets off on a quest to find a story for himself, and boy does he find one. He stumbles across the town of `Dirt' and it's littered with colorful characters. Several other little animals ranging from snake to hawk await him in the little town and Rango is determined to make an impression.The film takes a nice bold stride from goofball comedy into a classic western, as Rango puts on a show claiming that he is the new kid on the block and is not to be reckoned with.We know he's a scaredy-cat but he doesn't want them to know, so he claims some achievements big and tall. When a local patron asks him in front of everyone at the town's bar, if he was responsible for killing a set of brothers, he is quick to say yes and add that he did it with only one bullet. It's then immediately revealed that there were in fact six brothers that were killed, and Rango has a hidden large gulp that sends us rolling. This is the comedic tone of the film and it lasts from beginning to end.I enjoyed Depp in Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, and I was even more thrilled with him here, and look forward to more vocal talents from him in the future; he's every bit as creative in a voice box as he is in any dramatic scene.Director Gore Verbinski who worked with Depp on the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films has done nothing short of spectacular in the look and cinematic scope of this animated film. There is just as much adventure to be found in Rango as any of those live action films.",5,Rango Review,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,2642,"['RANGOSTARRING', 'voices', 'Jonny', 'Depp', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'StantonWRITTEN', 'BY', 'John', 'Logan', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'James', 'Ward', 'ByrkitDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Gore', 'VerbinskiRated', 'PGGenre', 'Animation', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '04', 'March', '2011Review', 'Date', '21', 'February', '2011How', 'do', 'even', 'begin', 'explain', 'brilliance', 'Rango', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2011', 'early', 'line', 'going', 'be', 'heavy', 'contender', 'Oscar', 'best', 'animated', 'feature', 'category', 'marvelous.The', 'tremendous', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'voice', 'very', 'likeable', 'chameleon', 'name', 'Rango', 'Rango', 'head', 'slightly', 'misshapen', 'one', 'eye', 'bulging', 'out', 'obscure', 'angel', 'only', 'red', 'white', 'Hawaiian', 'shirt.He', 'often', 'being', 'hero', 'shown', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'acting', 'out', 'plays', 'lifeless', 'friends', 'live', 'little', 'world', 'Yep', 'life', 'pretty', 'dull', 'pet', 'glass', 'cage', 'automobile', 'accident', 'literally', 'entire', 'world', 'stranded', 'side', 'desert', 'strewn', 'road.Thirsty', 'adventure', 'off', 'quest', 'find', 'story', 'boy', 'find', 'one', 'town', 'Dirt', 'littered', 'colorful', 'characters', 'Several', 'other', 'little', 'animals', 'ranging', 'snake', 'hawk', 'await', 'little', 'town', 'Rango', 'determined', 'make', 'impression.The', 'film', 'nice', 'bold', 'stride', 'goofball', 'comedy', 'classic', 'western', 'Rango', 'show', 'claiming', 'new', 'kid', 'block', 'not', 'be', 'reckoned', 'with.We', 'know', 'scaredy-cat', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'achievements', 'big', 'tall', 'When', 'local', 'patron', 'front', 'everyone', 'town', 'bar', 'was', 'responsible', 'killing', 'set', 'brothers', 'quick', 'say', 'yes', 'add', 'did', 'only', 'one', 'bullet', 'then', 'immediately', 'revealed', 'were', 'fact', 'six', 'brothers', 'were', 'killed', 'Rango', 'hidden', 'large', 'gulp', 'rolling', 'comedic', 'tone', 'film', 'beginning', 'end.I', 'enjoyed', 'Depp', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'thrilled', 'here', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'vocal', 'talents', 'future', 'bit', 'creative', 'voice', 'box', 'dramatic', 'scene.Director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'who', 'worked', 'Depp', 'first', 'three', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'films', 'done', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'look', 'cinematic', 'scope', 'animated', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'adventure', 'be', 'found', 'Rango', 'live', 'action', 'films']",N/A

1372219,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003Y5H53S,C. Sawin,"[195, 241]","Director Gore Verbinski has put together quite the filmography over the years. His first feature film was the family comedy Mousehunt, which he followed up with the R-rated action comedy The Mexican. He also jumped on the successful remake bandwagon before the trend really took off with The Ring. It was the Pirates of the Caribbean films that teamed the director with the hottest actor in Hollywood today; Johnny Depp. Perhaps it's because those films made over a billion dollars at the box office or because they just had fun working together or a little bit of both that Depp was chosen to voice a talking chameleon in Verbinski's bizarre yet spectacular animated adventure known as Rango.Rango isn't your average animated film. That fact will become abundantly clear during Rango's opening monologue amongst his ""friends."" The film is actually more adult than any of the trailers let on. Within the first ten minutes of the film, Rango has a rather lengthy conversation with some fresh roadkill. In addition to that, the last half of the film is much darker than the first half. Maybe it's the countless number of bats with gatling guns strapped to them, Rattlesnake Jake being one of the most menacing animated villains in years, the film using its fair share of both ""hell"" and ""damn"" quite a few times, the film not shying away from the use of nooses, or, God forbid, animated characters smoking, but Rango just doesn't feel like an everyday, run-of-the-mill film put out by Nickelodeon.Rango also wears its western references on its sleeve. The old time saloons, tumbleweeds, stare downs before a gunfight, and a town's utmost desire for both a sheriff and something to believe in are proof of that. But perhaps it's Timothy Olyphant's cameo appearance as The Spirit of the West that is both the biggest homage to westerns you could possibly think of and the biggest surprise of the film (at least as far as his appearance goes). Well it's either that or the Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas reference. Both are equally amazing.This has the atmosphere of an animated film that was made for adults. It's very off-balanced in the best kind of way, but a lot of the references and humor are sure to go over a child's head. Some of the characters in the film talk really fast (mostly just Rango and Beans at times) and while Rango is goofy enough to make the kids laugh, the subject content involving the town of Dirt certainly seems to be aimed towards a more mature sense of humor.Rango is the first animated film from Industrial Light & Magic, the special effects company that did computer generated effects for the first three Star Wars films and the effects for the T-1000 in Terminator 2 among countless others. The film looks phenomenal. There were times when Rango looked like he was walking in an actual desert. While the characters weren't quite as detailed as the owls in Legend of the Guardians, they still looked incredibly realistic or as realistic as talking animals could possibly be.Rango is one of the most eccentric animated films you'll ever have the pleasure of sitting through. Its homage to westerns combined with its explosive action sequences, an endless amount of hilarity, tender and sentimental moments that actually make you feel sorry for a talking lizard, and even a little bit of romance pretty much has all your bases covered as far as genres are concerned. Rango is a dark, witty, and entertaining ride that's also fairly mature for an animated film. All in all, Rango is easily the best movie of 2011 so far.",5,Brilliant in every sense of the word,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,3546,"['Director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'put', 'together', 'quite', 'filmography', 'years', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'family', 'comedy', 'Mousehunt', 'followed', 'up', 'R-rated', 'action', 'comedy', 'Mexican', 'also', 'jumped', 'successful', 'remake', 'bandwagon', 'trend', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'Ring', 'was', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'films', 'teamed', 'director', 'hottest', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Perhaps', 'films', 'made', 'billion', 'dollars', 'box', 'office', 'just', 'had', 'fun', 'working', 'together', 'little', 'bit', 'Depp', 'was', 'chosen', 'voice', 'talking', 'chameleon', 'Verbinski', 'bizarre', 'yet', 'spectacular', 'animated', 'adventure', 'known', 'Rango.Rango', ""n't"", 'average', 'animated', 'film', 'fact', 'will', 'become', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'Rango', 'opening', 'monologue', 'friends', 'film', 'actually', 'more', 'adult', 'trailers', 'let', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'Rango', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'conversation', 'fresh', 'roadkill', 'addition', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'much', 'darker', 'first', 'half', 'countless', 'number', 'bats', 'gatling', 'guns', 'strapped', 'Rattlesnake', 'Jake', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'menacing', 'animated', 'villains', 'years', 'film', 'using', 'fair', 'share', 'hell', 'damn', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'film', 'not', 'shying', 'away', 'use', 'nooses', 'God', 'forbid', 'animated', 'characters', 'smoking', 'Rango', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'everyday', 'run-of-the-mill', 'film', 'put', 'out', 'Nickelodeon.Rango', 'also', 'western', 'references', 'sleeve', 'old', 'time', 'saloons', 'tumbleweeds', 'stare', 'downs', 'gunfight', 'town', 'utmost', 'desire', 'sheriff', 'something', 'believe', 'are', 'proof', 'perhaps', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Spirit', 'West', 'biggest', 'homage', 'westerns', 'could', 'possibly', 'think', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'film', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'appearance', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'reference', 'are', 'equally', 'amazing.This', 'atmosphere', 'animated', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'adults', 'very', 'off-balanced', 'best', 'kind', 'way', 'lot', 'references', 'humor', 'are', 'sure', 'go', 'over', 'child', 'head', 'characters', 'film', 'talk', 'really', 'fast', 'mostly', 'just', 'Rango', 'Beans', 'times', 'Rango', 'goofy', 'enough', 'make', 'kids', 'laugh', 'subject', 'content', 'involving', 'town', 'Dirt', 'certainly', 'be', 'aimed', 'more', 'mature', 'sense', 'humor.Rango', 'first', 'animated', 'film', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'Magic', 'special', 'effects', 'company', 'did', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'first', 'three', 'Star', 'Wars', 'films', 'effects', 'T-1000', 'Terminator', '2', 'countless', 'others', 'film', 'phenomenal', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'Rango', 'looked', 'was', 'walking', 'actual', 'desert', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'detailed', 'owls', 'Legend', 'Guardians', 'still', 'looked', 'incredibly', 'realistic', 'as', 'realistic', 'talking', 'animals', 'could', 'possibly', 'be.Rango', 'one', 'most', 'eccentric', 'animated', 'films', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'have', 'pleasure', 'sitting', 'homage', 'westerns', 'combined', 'explosive', 'action', 'sequences', 'endless', 'amount', 'hilarity', 'tender', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'actually', 'make', 'feel', 'sorry', 'talking', 'lizard', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'romance', 'pretty', 'much', 'bases', 'covered', 'as', 'far', 'genres', 'are', 'concerned', 'Rango', 'dark', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'also', 'fairly', 'mature', 'animated', 'film', 'Rango', 'easily', 'best', 'movie', '2011', 'so', 'far']",N/A

1372223,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B003Y5H53S,DanD,"[3, 5]","This is the story of a domesticated, delusional chameleon left alone to die in the desert.  Except, instead of dying, he stumbles upon the dried-up town of Dirt, where water is more precious than gold, and life hangs by a precious, dwindling thread.  Our hero, a fan of cinema and improvisation, dubs himself Rango, and quickly becomes Dirt's latest sheriff.  This isn't the dream job he imagined, however, and soon he becomes enmeshed in a web of violence and deceit from escape may require the ultimate sacrifice.Owing as much to CHINATOWN as to the classic westerns it lovingly rips-off, RANGO is a real treat.  Gore Verbinski's direction is surprisingly solid; he's never been a consistent filmmaker, but here he hits his stride and stays mostly steady.  There's a bit too much slapstick early in the film; this is clearly to engage the interest of younger viewers, but make no mistake: at its core, RANGO is not for children.  It's violent and provocative, with mild language and some thoroughly disturbing images.  Most of the darker stuff is understated (to the film's great credit), but it's definitely there.Johnny Depp is clearly the star here; he gets a little campy in spots (again, targeting the young'uns), but at some points you can forget who's voicing Rango, and simply enjoy the character as another of Depp's personae.  He's joined by a select group of talent: Isla Fisher, Alfred Molina, Stephen Root, Ned Beatty, Abigail Breslin, Ray Winstone, Harry Dean Stanton, and Timothy Olyphant doing a spot-on Eastwood.  Kudos go to Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake; his performance serves as a textbook example of how to act using only your voice.The film is riddled with references to other westerns and Depp films, but truly, it stands on its own.  It could be a little edgier and darker (if they'd gone for a PG-13 rating, for example), but as is, it's a refreshing, riveting western that just happens to star a lizard.  If you're put off by the animation, don't be; this isn't just a kid's movie, it's a film for anyone who loves a complex, rollicking good film.

1372224,A2TVJ0YDW3QO63,B003Y5H53S,Dan McKinnon,"[60, 91]","Rango is a western that just happens to star animated animals instead of humans.  Little kids wouldn't care for westerns, and shouldn't be taken to them for reasons of violence, and they will not find the subject matter interesting.The same logic can be applied here as well.I took my 6 year old daughter to see Rango today, and it became apparent within 5 minutes of the movie that this would not be the ideal film for her, or any other young children.  The entire time the movie was playing, kids were talking, barely laughing, and many were obviously bored.  It's difficult to summarize quickly what was 'bad' about Rango because it's difficult to do.The Good- the animation is absolutely top-notch, picture perfect and beautiful- Johnny Depp and other actors did a great job with their performances, probably due to the unique way lines were recorded- tons of inside jokes that referenced other movies (I love the Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas moment)The Bad- the story will bore any young child in no time flat, they just won't like it- most laughs are from the inside jokes, I can't remember the theater laughing strongly at any moment- the language is not good for a kid movie; others have complained about ""hell"" being used over and over again, I was unhappy that ""damn"" was used at the end for no good reasonFor adults I recommend Rango but just barely.  The story 'should' work better, but there is no clear flow to the film.  It feels jagged and rough around the edges, and just doesn't grab you.  If you appreciate animation for what it is, then I can lay 5 stars on this.  It's a treat for the eyes and will no doubt get you to say ""wow"" several times.I expected a lot more from this movie and it didn't deliver.  If the target audience truly is little kids, then higher ups should have intervened long ago.  If the audience was adults, then I guess the end result is good, but it's a shame the animation effort was used on a movie that just doesn't hit any home runs.***",3,Rango Is NOT For Young Children,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,1983,"['Rango', 'western', 'just', 'star', 'animated', 'animals', 'instead', 'humans', 'Little', 'kids', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'westerns', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'reasons', 'violence', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'subject', 'matter', 'interesting.The', 'same', 'logic', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'here', 'well.I', 'took', '6', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'see', 'Rango', 'today', 'became', 'apparent', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'ideal', 'film', 'other', 'young', 'children', 'entire', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'kids', 'were', 'talking', 'barely', 'laughing', 'many', 'were', 'obviously', 'bored', 'difficult', 'summarize', 'quickly', 'what', 'was', ""'bad"", 'Rango', 'difficult', 'do.The', 'Good-', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'top-notch', 'picture', 'perfect', 'beautiful-', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'other', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'performances', 'probably', 'due', 'unique', 'way', 'lines', 'were', 'recorded-', 'tons', 'inside', 'jokes', 'referenced', 'other', 'movies', 'love', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'moment', 'Bad-', 'story', 'will', 'bore', 'young', 'child', 'time', 'flat', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'it-', 'most', 'laughs', 'are', 'inside', 'jokes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'theater', 'laughing', 'strongly', 'moment-', 'language', 'not', 'good', 'kid', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'complained', 'hell', 'being', 'used', 'over', 'again', 'was', 'unhappy', 'damn', 'was', 'used', 'end', 'good', 'reasonFor', 'adults', 'recommend', 'Rango', 'just', 'barely', 'story', ""'should"", 'work', 'better', 'clear', 'flow', 'film', 'jagged', 'rough', 'edges', 'just', ""n't"", 'grab', 'appreciate', 'animation', 'what', 'then', 'can', 'lay', '5', 'stars', 'treat', 'eyes', 'will', 'doubt', 'get', 'say', 'wow', 'several', 'times.I', 'expected', 'lot', 'more', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'target', 'audience', 'truly', 'little', 'kids', 'then', 'higher', 'ups', 'should', 'have', 'intervened', 'long', 'ago', 'audience', 'was', 'adults', 'then', 'guess', 'end', 'result', 'good', 'shame', 'animation', 'effort', 'was', 'used', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'hit', 'home', 'runs', '***']",N/A

1372239,A2QKMTVZK2GWIH,B003Y5H53S,dnewman2,"[4, 8]","Exquisite in its particulars, the animated RANGO stumbles in most of its bigger picture issues.  Any pretext of dramatically coherent storytelling with emotionally engaging characters is left in RANGO's desert dust.  Instead, director Gore Verbinski delivers an eye-popping smorgasbord of glib cleverness and over-done homage.With its unique look and meticulous attention to detail, there is almost always something remarkable to look at in RANGO.  But in this tale of a domesticated chameleon, Rango (Johnny Depp), abandoned by a near auto accident in the Mojave Desert, who stumbles upon the parched town of Dirt and becomes its de facto sheriff, did I ever care all that much about what was going on?  Not really.  The main problem is that the screenplay by John Logan (GLADIATOR, Spielberg's upcoming LINCOLN), from a story by Logan, Verbinski and James Byrkit, doesn't build the characters or events into a satisfying whole.  Also, this ostensible comedy is never very funny.  You might chuckle to yourself here and there, but the movie doesn't evoke many real laughs.Given Verbinski's track record helming the first three inexplicably popular PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movies, the results here are not unexpected.  Like those live-action cartoons, RANGO is visually impressive with a difficult-to-follow story that builds to obligatory action set-pieces, populated by characters in which the audience has virtually no emotional investment.  But RANGO is also hampered by one other aspect - its over-reliance on a steady stream of pop culture references (though I'm sure the filmmakers would call it hommage).The main plot is a complete rip-off of CHINATOWN, complete with mysteriously diverted water and a bad guy mayor (Ned Beatty) closely modeled on John Huston's Noah Cross.  The character of the Spirit of the West (voiced by Timothy Olyphant), who inspires Rango to action in the third act, is Clint Eastwood.  From Sergio Leone to STAR WARS to Carlos Castaneda's Don Juan to Barney Fife, the movie becomes an exercise in ""spot the allusion.""  And when the plot veers into head-scratching, ""what's going on?"" territory (like in the characters' brief view of Las Vegas), the audience is further removed from the experience.Despite these criticisms, the animated world of RANGO offers a treasure trove of visual pleasures.  With the bar set so high over the last several years of CGI development, the art, animation and effects teams have done an extraordinary job in creating a living, breathing, visually stunning world.  While the bug-eyed Rango and the denizens of Dirt, mostly desert-dwelling reptiles and small mammals, are not necessarily attractive, they are unique character creations that are true to their world.  Visual credit must also be shared by the brilliant Roger Deakins (cinematographer of TRUE GRIT, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and many, many more) for his contributions to the film's striking look.",3,"Brilliant look, weak story",1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,2923,"['Exquisite', 'particulars', 'animated', 'RANGO', 'stumbles', 'most', 'bigger', 'picture', 'issues', 'pretext', 'dramatically', 'coherent', 'storytelling', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'characters', 'left', 'RANGO', 'desert', 'dust', 'Instead', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'eye-popping', 'smorgasbord', 'glib', 'cleverness', 'over-done', 'homage.With', 'unique', 'look', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'detail', 'almost', 'always', 'something', 'remarkable', 'look', 'RANGO', 'tale', 'domesticated', 'chameleon', 'Rango', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'abandoned', 'near', 'auto', 'accident', 'Mojave', 'Desert', 'who', 'parched', 'town', 'Dirt', 'de', 'facto', 'sheriff', 'did', 'ever', 'care', 'that', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Not', 'really', 'main', 'problem', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Logan', 'GLADIATOR', 'Spielberg', 'upcoming', 'LINCOLN', 'story', 'Logan', 'Verbinski', 'James', 'Byrkit', ""n't"", 'build', 'characters', 'events', 'satisfying', 'whole', 'Also', 'ostensible', 'comedy', 'never', 'very', 'funny', 'might', 'chuckle', 'here', 'there', 'movie', ""n't"", 'evoke', 'many', 'real', 'laughs.Given', 'Verbinski', 'track', 'record', 'helming', 'first', 'three', 'inexplicably', 'popular', 'PIRATES', 'THE', 'CARIBBEAN', 'movies', 'results', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'unexpected', 'live-action', 'cartoons', 'RANGO', 'visually', 'impressive', 'difficult-to-follow', 'story', 'obligatory', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'populated', 'characters', 'audience', 'virtually', 'emotional', 'investment', 'RANGO', 'also', 'hampered', 'one', 'other', 'aspect', 'over-reliance', 'steady', 'stream', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', ""'m"", 'sure', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'call', 'hommage', '.The', 'main', 'plot', 'complete', 'rip-off', 'CHINATOWN', 'complete', 'mysteriously', 'diverted', 'water', 'bad', 'guy', 'mayor', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'closely', 'modeled', 'John', 'Huston', 'Noah', 'Cross', 'character', 'Spirit', 'West', 'voiced', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'who', 'Rango', 'action', 'third', 'act', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'Carlos', 'Castaneda', 'Don', 'Juan', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'movie', 'exercise', 'spot', 'allusion', 'when', 'plot', 'veers', 'head-scratching', 'what', 'going', 'territory', 'characters', 'brief', 'view', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'audience', 'further', 'removed', 'experience.Despite', 'criticisms', 'animated', 'world', 'RANGO', 'treasure', 'trove', 'visual', 'pleasures', 'bar', 'set', 'so', 'high', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'CGI', 'development', 'art', 'animation', 'effects', 'teams', 'have', 'done', 'extraordinary', 'job', 'creating', 'living', 'breathing', 'visually', 'stunning', 'world', 'bug-eyed', 'Rango', 'denizens', 'Dirt', 'mostly', 'desert-dwelling', 'reptiles', 'small', 'mammals', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'attractive', 'are', 'unique', 'character', 'creations', 'are', 'true', 'world', 'Visual', 'credit', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'shared', 'brilliant', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'cinematographer', 'TRUE', 'GRIT', 'NO', 'COUNTRY', 'FOR', 'OLD', 'MEN', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'contributions', 'film', 'striking', 'look']",N/A

The characters and the settings are bizarre and the story is full of references to other movies (especially westerns). Rango is an animated western in which the main character wants to find who he really is and what part does he play in the world. The story is amazingly told. All the comedy, the adventure, the dialogue is very original and smart. I have to say that when I first saw the ads for this movie, I wasn't interested but after seen it in theaters, I absolutely love it. This film may not be for little kids and I mean that in a good way. It's refreshing to see an animated film were adults can enjoy it as much or even more than kids. Kids from 8 onwards will definetely enjoy it.The characters are really odd as the whole movie is, but that enhances the story. The animation done by ILM is amazing. It's the first animated film they produce and already are in the level of the Pixar films. Simply excellent. The voice cast is really good with Johnny Depp being outstanding as the titular lizard. Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty and Bill Nighy are excellent as well. The story is very interesting and will keep you invested the whole time and there are a lot of references from other films that will make you laugh. The score by Hans Zimmer is outstanding. Gore Verbinsky has done and incredible motion picture and I wouldn't be surprised if this one is a front runner for the Oscars. Is really that good.Video & Audio:Paramount has done an impressive job with this BD. Simply put it, this BD is the best looking of this year and one of the best ever. All the detail, the clarity, the contrast, everything is perfect. The animation comes to life like never before and the colors are extremelly well reproduced. An incredible transfer!!!The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is also absolutelyu gorgeous. Sound effects are crisp, dialogue is clear and there are not distortions of any type. Amazing sound!!!Bonus Feautures:First you have two versions of the film: the theatrical release and an extended edition with some additional scenes. Also you have a documentary of the whole production of the film which is amazing. Full animated deleted scenes which are the ones included in the extended version including an extended ending. Also you have an interactive tour around the town of Dirt, a ""Animal Planet"" type program that explains which animals are included in Rango, the theatrical trailer, an audiocommentary and a storyboard to film comparison.All the bonus material is excellent and fun to watch.A DVD and a Digital Copy are also included.Final Thoughts:With amazing animation, a great story, interesting characters and witty dialogue, Rango was a very pleasant surprise. This BD offers truly amazing video and audio and a great amount of bonus material making this set a wonderful one for a wonderful film.

It wasn't horrible by any means, but at the same time, I wasn't at the edge of my seat or laughing my head off.Rango's best feature is clearly the animation.  The detail of Rango's skin, teeth, and tounge, the shots with people in them, and the sequences with water spilling all over the places.  All of these were visually stunning.  But unfortunately, we need more than just something to look at to make a good movie.The main focus of the movie was getting water back to this old west town.  Unfortunately, there wasn't really much tension built up to give the movie any kind of forward drive.  There are small fights mixed in between Rango and other characters, but you don't really get the sense that Rango is all that passionate about getting water.The character of Rango himself is very likeable.  He's kind of a ""fish out of water"" type that's been thrown into this mess against his will.

Usually avoiding any review of animation - except for the cream of the crop and the ones too ghastly to mention - RANGO left me wondering how to review it. It isn't entirely bad, it's amazing animation and talent ... yet I feel as lost as Rango. This thing is empty, poorly directed and just plain confusing.Rango (Johnny Depp desperately trying not to sound like Jim Carrey) is a chameleon (the species I always call the ""square-head"") who is lost to his owners in a spectacular speed-bump fracas on the highway. Almost the first fellow he encounters is an armadillo (credited as ""Road Kill"" and expertly voiced by Alfred Molina) - who has been run over with the tiretrack splat running right through his middle.It was at this very early stage I thought this was going to suck. Despite Depp and Molina - both skilled, chameleonic in themselves - I resigned myself to another strange, pointless film. Which it was. Yet I found myself riveted by the animation and the vocal talent - which in my opinion is a cynical thing on the part of the producers.They can do much better than this - don't let anyone tell you differently.With vocal talents from Ned Beatty doing his best John Houston impression (he's a tortoise), to Bill Nighy doing his best snarling Alice Cooper impression (he's a rattlesnake), and other people I don't know, all acting their hearts out through their voices ... well it is a temptation but it fails. The storyline is really so weird because it alternates between weird and pathetically predictable. Depp has some really hilarious lines - or is that just a mirage?I won't spoil anything here. This thing is already spoiled, and that's just a pity. Honestly I was expecting something far better. This serves me right: I will stop investing my hopes that animation will be good, and just accept it for whatever it is.This made me really want to watch KUNG FU PANDA again ....RARE AND UNUSUAL UPDATE: Can't say what exactly is happening here, but this RANGO thing has got some heavy-hitting campaign happening here on Amazon. Honest reviews are being voted down viciously and the reviewers are being insulted.That is just sad. So many reviewers draw our attention to the reasons this animation is bad: the swearing, the rotten story, the count-the-allusions-to-old-Westerns, the cynical money-grubbing nature of it all, and I have seen nearly a dozen reviews stating that they got this for their kids and the kids hated it/walked out on it.Amazon!

1372257,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B003Y5H53S,Einsatz,"[1, 1]","Rango won an Oscar for best animated film (there wasn't much competition that year).  It is a sour, ill-tempered cartoon meant for adults, children would never get the `humor' or the scattered references (such as a Salvador Dali dream sequence).  Violence plays a pronounced role throughout.  The plot borrows heavily from every western archetype (not always to the best advantage of that genre).  The story involves a pampered pet chameleon who finds himself stranded in the Mojave Desert after getting unceremoniously bounced from the vehicle he and his tank were traveling in.  He names himself Rango and soon finds himself the sheriff of the town of Dirt.  And thus, a legend begins.  The rest of the plot deals with water and the lack thereof.  Rango is played mostly for laughs but the humor is a bit lax at times.  How you will respond to it depends entirely on what you consider funny.  The gags go from lame to desperate to nasty.  The pace is dead slow; the movie is unmercifully long and outstays its welcome by an hour or more.  Johnny Depp voices Rango as if he was channeling Barney Fife (sometimes that came across as cute, sometimes it was just annoying).  I found the insensible humor bothersome from the start and since it was consistent, I felt the same way once it was finally over.  On the whole, I thought Rango was a bit too cynical.  The characters were collectively unlovable.  I can't imagine ever wanting to watch it again.But.  The artwork was absolutely spectacular.  This movie was beautifully crafted in that regard.

1372261,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B003Y5H53S,Enjolras,"[3, 5]","Rango is a different type of animated film, to say the least. It resembles a classic Western - with the new Sheriff, self-dealing mayor, and wretched citizens - more than it resembles anything Pixar has put out. The characters curse and can be downright grim. In short, this isn't a kid's movie.If you can get beyond that fact, Rango is pretty entertaining. It has two great strengths. First, the animation is exceptional - easily the best I've ever seen. The hair and scales on the animals looks eerily real. At times I even wondered if ILM had inserted real animals into the film, particularly for the Hawks and Snakes.Second, the characterization of Rango - the little green chameleon - becomes a more convincing and complex character than those found in many live-action Westerns. He begins as almost a Don Quixote type character, starts telling tall tales, and soon finds himself forced to respond to events. He never quite loses his inner doubts, but he also clearly possesses an inner strength. It's a joy to watch him grow. In addition, the film has some genuinely funny moments, mostly with Rango at the center.Despite this, my criticism of the film is precisely the same one pointed out by so many other reviewers here: the film seems to want to appeal to adult and child audiences at the same time, but doesn't really succeed in doing this. So much of the film - the language, the allusions to Western classics, the grim ambience - is geared towards adults, that the more childlike scenes - particularly the cartoonish battle royale at the end - are all the more jarring.Overall, if you're an adult or older kid who likes animated films, Rango's worth checking out.",4,"Rango, a new breed of action hero",1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,1676,"['Rango', 'different', 'type', 'animated', 'film', 'say', 'least', 'classic', 'Western', 'new', 'Sheriff', 'self-dealing', 'mayor', 'wretched', 'citizens', 'more', 'anything', 'Pixar', 'put', 'out', 'characters', 'curse', 'can', 'be', 'downright', 'grim', 'short', ""n't"", 'kid', 'movie.If', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'Rango', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'two', 'great', 'strengths', 'First', 'animation', 'exceptional', 'easily', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'hair', 'scales', 'animals', 'eerily', 'real', 'times', 'even', 'wondered', 'ILM', 'had', 'inserted', 'real', 'animals', 'film', 'particularly', 'Hawks', 'Snakes.Second', 'characterization', 'Rango', 'little', 'green', 'chameleon', 'more', 'convincing', 'complex', 'character', 'found', 'many', 'live-action', 'Westerns', 'almost', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'type', 'character', 'telling', 'tall', 'tales', 'soon', 'forced', 'respond', 'events', 'never', 'quite', 'inner', 'doubts', 'also', 'clearly', 'inner', 'strength', 'joy', 'watch', 'grow', 'addition', 'film', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'mostly', 'Rango', 'center.Despite', 'criticism', 'film', 'precisely', 'same', 'one', 'pointed', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'film', 'want', 'appeal', 'adult', 'child', 'audiences', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'really', 'succeed', 'doing', 'So', 'much', 'film', 'language', 'allusions', 'Western', 'classics', 'grim', 'ambience', 'geared', 'towards', 'adults', 'more', 'childlike', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'cartoonish', 'battle', 'royale', 'end', 'are', 'more', 'jarring.Overall', ""'re"", 'adult', 'older', 'kid', 'who', 'likes', 'animated', 'films', 'Rango', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

1372264,A1CHM200OEN65X,B003Y5H53S,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[5, 9]","From the trailers, ""Rango"" appeared to be a laugh-out-loud, fun, somewhat subversive, but mostly shallow story for the kids. Instead, it's a clever tale about discovering yourself and the need for community, while incorporating sly nods at the entire art of storytelling and screenwriting. It's comedy, adventure, high-noon cowboy fun, mixed in with esoteric bits of wisdom and some dark, scary moments for children.Rango is a lizard thrown from the back of a car traveling through the desert. After meeting a philosophizing armadillo, he wanders off into the heat and sand in search of very real, yet metaphoric, water. He comes upon the town of Dirt, realizes that water is kept in a vault in the town bank, and the mayor is using water as a symbol of hope and religious coercion over the townspeople. Rango's arrival, however, upends the mayor's plans when Rango inadvertently becomes a hero and tries to live up to his self-created mythology. Of course, not all comes easily for the well-meaning lizard, and even his own hopes of love and friendship become victims to his ultimate cowardice and inability. It's in those moments that he must discover not only who he is, but why he should be who he is. It's not about him. It's about others.Many life lessons lie hidden in this story, some more obvious than others. It has some truly funny moments, and some truly frightening moments for kids. It has some truly wise moments. There's a scene early in the movie during which Rango begins using his chameleon abilities to hide, but finds himself distracted and becomes the target of a hawk. He escapes. The antics had me laughing out loud. And I was fully engaged.

Then I stopped trying to think of it as a animated movie for kids, and as one for adults with adult themes and the whole thing clicked.  Watching it on Blu-Ray later on just cemented that impression.Rango is a lizard who begins life in his tiny world and sees himself as an actor, as the hero-protagonist playing off against his non-living (mostly plastic) friends.  He suddenly realizes that he needs that sudden change to happen, the action which will propel the ""hero"" into action.  Of course, it then happens...and he is suddenly left by the side of the road in the desert.  A much much larger and more dangerous world.  At first, he is lost, but then he finds his stride by re-inventing himself as the hero he always thought he was, even though, deep down, he struggles with the realization that it is just a sham.  Just more play-acting.Yet the town of Dirt (filled with all sorts of desert creatures, dressed and based off a wide array of old Westerns--you will recognize quite a few of the characters) needs a real hero because their source of life and income, the water, has mysteriously dried up.  They place their hopes and dreams into Rango, who responds as best he can.  Yet, he must actually confront the truths about himself before he can be all that they need him to be.This is movie about a spiritual journey.  Not only does Rango seek to discover his true self, but he also learns how to care about others along the way.  He passes through death at one point to the magical and mysterious world on ""the other side,"" and there realizes why he exists.  He steps into the role that Fate intended for him, a fulfillment of the mystical hero who embodies the Spirit of the West.You will recognize loads of voices, and mannerisms, in this movie and shades of scenes from any good Western.  It has its funny moments, but overall this is a serious movie.  It reminded me of the ""hero quest"" that Joseph Campbell talked about in his lectures and books.  By the end of the movie, Rango has definitely found his ""bliss.""Highly recommended.  Just don't go into this thinking, like I did from the ads, that this was a kid's movie.  Each time I watch the movie, I get more out of it and it makes me think about how I can be the protagonist of my own life.

On that note, I really appreciated the cameo persona of Hunter S. Thompson ""I knew it!  Another One!"".  The story is setup in a very unique way, nothing else quite like it.  I enjoyed how they mixed the adult story line with the quirky animation style, bringing it to a new level.  Although not entirely what I would call a children's story it is still viewable by children as long as you don't mind a little violence (nothing extreme).  Currently holds as my son's favorite movie, he insists on watching it almost daily.The characters are fairly well developed especially the star ""Rango"" you really get a feel for the type of ""person"" he is and see him evolve through the story.  The writers I have to give a tip of the hat, brilliant story laced with quick wit and dry adult style humour.  Strangely despite seeing the movie dozens of times already, I don't really mind it and infact from time to time find myself laughing at something I've already laughed at too many times to count.  Even my father who is 68 enjoyed the movie so much after watching it with his grandson, he had to go out and purchase a copy for himself.  Overall I would probably give the movie 4.5 out of 5 stars but due to the fact they threw the cameo for Hunter S. Thompson I had to tack on another half star.

1372284,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003Y5H53S,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","One day it dawned on them folks at Industrial Light & Magic that the animated film may not be this ephemeral thing after all, may not be so flash in the pan after all. Maybe in the last annual nerd jamboree, the Pixar posse lorded it over ILM. Whatever, whatever. RANGO happens to be ILM's first foray in feature length animation. In 2011 it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, officially marking it as an auspicious debut. The lording-it-over honors have just shifted.Johnny Depp and director Gore Verbinski reunite, if you care about that. Depp provides the voice of our lead character, a lonely pet chameleon harboring big dreams but whose universe is encompassed in a terranium. It's kind of neat that the chameleon doesn't attain a name until the narrative requires him to come up with one.When a highway accident shatters his terranium and plummets him out of a speeding vehicle, the lizard with no name finds himself trudging across the Mojave desert. Eventually he shuffles into the desperate, ramshackle frontier town of Dirt, and it's at this stage that the film morphs into a western.It's been remarked that RANGO lifts a bit of CHINATOWN's plot trajectory, and there's truth to that. Dirt is a dying town, its populace wilting under an extensive drought and sorely in need of hope. Along comes our lizard, an out-of-towner with a theatrical bent who is facile with words and who, in a moment of jeopardy, assumes the mythic persona of an accomplished gunslinger. In that saloon, he sells his tall tale to those within earshot, convinces them that seven bandidos could be killed with one bullet (providing the seventh hombre expires of the resulting infection).I had to be talked into watching this one. I'd looked at the promotional art and at an image of Rango with his weird, zigzaggy neck and Hawaiian shirt and I extrapolated (wrongfully) that this would be too weird and unconventional for me to absorb. But even though the film renders the characters as occasionally grotesque, the animators devote an underlay of amazing texture to them and to the sets. While the film retains its cartoony elements, it also touts a photorealistic look. The backdrops are stunning and I really enjoyed watching these characters in motion. The animators evoke the sensation of what it's like to thirst in the unforgiving desert. I must've guzzled eight bottles of water, purely out of sympathy, while watching this film.The story itself isn't groundbreaking; it pulls familiar tropes from Old West cinema. The laughs tend to be more hit and miss. But the execution of plot and voice performances and exquisite animation make RANGO a must-see experience. RANGO is a family film in that there's something for both kids and grown-ups. Ned Beatty and Bill Nighy are tremendous as, respectively, the tortoise town mayor and the frightening Rattlesnake Jake (who, admittedly, may prove to be too scary for the younger kids). Timothy Oliphant does a passable impression of the most iconic figure in spaghetti western. But what really sold me on RANGO? It's those damn owl mariachis. When you're ranking cinematic Greek choruses, the owls are right up there with the girl trio from LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and Jonathan Richman from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. And if you're looking for a narrative in which the protagonist is in search of an identity, well, fine, that's here, too.The DVD's bonus stuff:- option to view the film either in theatrical version or extended version- Audio Commentary with director/producer/co-writer Gore Verbinski, head of story James Ward Byrkit, production designer Mark McCreery, animation director Hal Hickel, and visual effects supervisor Tim Alexander- 10 Deleted Scenes, although if you'd watched the extended version, you've seen these already (totals 00:08:52 minutes)- ""Real Creatures of Dirt"" - meet the real life desert creatures that RANGO ended up anthropomorphizing (00:22:12  minutes)",4,"""I think the metaphor broke my spleen.""",1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,3937,"['One', 'day', 'dawned', 'folks', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'Magic', 'animated', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'ephemeral', 'thing', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'flash', 'pan', 'Maybe', 'last', 'annual', 'nerd', 'jamboree', 'Pixar', 'posse', 'lorded', 'over', 'ILM', 'Whatever', 'RANGO', 'be', 'ILM', 'first', 'foray', 'feature', 'length', 'animation', '2011', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'officially', 'marking', 'auspicious', 'debut', 'lording-it-over', 'honors', 'have', 'just', 'shifted.Johnny', 'Depp', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'reunite', 'care', 'Depp', 'voice', 'lead', 'character', 'lonely', 'pet', 'chameleon', 'harboring', 'big', 'dreams', 'universe', 'encompassed', 'terranium', 'kind', 'neat', 'chameleon', ""n't"", 'attain', 'name', 'narrative', 'come', 'up', 'one.When', 'highway', 'accident', 'shatters', 'terranium', 'plummets', 'speeding', 'vehicle', 'lizard', 'name', 'trudging', 'Mojave', 'desert', 'Eventually', 'desperate', 'ramshackle', 'frontier', 'town', 'Dirt', 'stage', 'film', 'morphs', 'western.It', 'been', 'remarked', 'RANGO', 'bit', 'CHINATOWN', 'plot', 'trajectory', 'truth', 'Dirt', 'dying', 'town', 'populace', 'wilting', 'extensive', 'drought', 'sorely', 'need', 'hope', 'lizard', 'out-of-towner', 'theatrical', 'bent', 'who', 'facile', 'words', 'who', 'moment', 'jeopardy', 'mythic', 'persona', 'accomplished', 'gunslinger', 'saloon', 'tall', 'tale', 'earshot', 'seven', 'bandidos', 'could', 'be', 'killed', 'one', 'bullet', 'providing', 'seventh', 'hombre', 'resulting', 'infection', '.I', 'had', 'be', 'talked', 'watching', 'one', ""'d"", 'looked', 'promotional', 'art', 'image', 'Rango', 'weird', 'zigzaggy', 'neck', 'Hawaiian', 'shirt', 'extrapolated', 'wrongfully', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'weird', 'unconventional', 'absorb', 'even', 'film', 'characters', 'occasionally', 'grotesque', 'animators', 'devote', 'underlay', 'amazing', 'texture', 'sets', 'film', 'cartoony', 'elements', 'also', 'photorealistic', 'look', 'backdrops', 'are', 'stunning', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'characters', 'motion', 'animators', 'evoke', 'sensation', 'what', 'thirst', 'unforgiving', 'desert', 'must', ""'ve"", 'guzzled', 'eight', 'bottles', 'water', 'purely', 'sympathy', 'watching', 'film.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'groundbreaking', 'familiar', 'tropes', 'Old', 'West', 'cinema', 'laughs', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'hit', 'miss', 'execution', 'plot', 'voice', 'performances', 'exquisite', 'animation', 'make', 'RANGO', 'must-see', 'experience', 'RANGO', 'family', 'film', 'something', 'kids', 'grown-ups', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'are', 'tremendous', 'respectively', 'tortoise', 'town', 'mayor', 'frightening', 'Rattlesnake', 'Jake', 'who', 'admittedly', 'may', 'prove', 'be', 'too', 'scary', 'younger', 'kids', 'Timothy', 'Oliphant', 'passable', 'impression', 'most', 'iconic', 'figure', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'what', 'really', 'sold', 'RANGO', 'damn', 'owl', 'mariachis', 'When', ""'re"", 'ranking', 'cinematic', 'Greek', 'choruses', 'owls', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'girl', 'trio', 'LITTLE', 'SHOP', 'OF', 'HORRORS', 'Jonathan', 'Richman', 'THERE', 'SOMETHING', 'ABOUT', 'MARY', ""'re"", 'looking', 'narrative', 'protagonist', 'search', 'identity', 'well', 'fine', 'here', 'too.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'option', 'view', 'film', 'theatrical', 'version', 'extended', 'version-', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'director/producer/co-writer', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'head', 'story', 'James', 'Ward', 'Byrkit', 'production', 'designer', 'Mark', 'McCreery', 'animation', 'director', 'Hal', 'Hickel', 'visual', 'effects', 'supervisor', 'Tim', 'Alexander-', '10', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', ""'d"", 'watched', 'extended', 'version', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'totals', '00:08:52', 'minutes', 'Real', 'Creatures', 'Dirt', 'meet', 'real', 'life', 'desert', 'creatures', 'RANGO', 'ended', 'up', 'anthropomorphizing', '00:22:12', 'minutes']",N/A

I had approached this film with mixed expectations after reading the wildly varying customer reviews.  But my fears were for naught, as the instances of supposedly risqu&eacute; humor were deftly handled and not overtly offensive.  It appears that some people expected that Nickelodeon's involvement with the film meant it was a children's cartoon, while in fact it is something really new under the Sun.  And with that in mind, watch the Sun's effect on the hapless chameleon just after he is inadvertently abandoned in the desert, and shortly before he assumes the identity of ""Rango"".While the striking animation would hold a child's interest for a few minutes, the sometimes rapidly delivered nuanced dialogue and the numerous hat-tips to old movies would not appeal to most youngsters.

Last year, I took a chance on ""Number 9"", based on its quirky synopsis and I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, I ended up purchasing the DVD to enjoy again and again.  (Some movies never get old!)  So, when I read the synopsis for ""Rango"" on Amazon Prime, I decided to give it a shot...especially since I could watch it without paying any additional rental charges.  The story-line is, essentially, a classic Western in the tradition of ""High Noon"".  Most of the voice actors involved were A-list actors, starting with Johnny Depp. A Clint Eastwood sound-alike even makes a brief appearance as ""The Spirit of the West"".  The dialog was clever and, in places, downright hilarious.Speaking of Eastwood:  all those wonderful clich&eacute;s from Sergio Leone's ""spaghetti Westerns"" were included, which added to the fun.And then, there was the animation:  it was EXCELLENT...and the 3-dimensional characters practically leapt off my laptop's screen because they looked so lifelike.  There was a huge team of animators and compositors involved and it shows!  It appears that they took actual filmed locations and placed the animated characters within these backgrounds.  The results were seamless.This is NOT a movie for younger children because it contains graphic violence and strong language.  But, hey:  who says that only the kids get to enjoy an animated feature?  Reading through some of the 1-star reviews, it would seem that some people didn't bother to notice this video's rating or they are  just too sensitive and dour to enjoy it for what it is:  an ironic, very interesting and beautifully animated feature FOR THINKING ADULTS!

This little lizard is an out-of-work actor with delusions of adequacy who is accidentally dumped along the Interstate near a town in the throes of a drought.* Isla Fisher (""The Lookout"") is the spunky little gecko who is trying to save her daddy's ranch.* Abigail Breslin (""Zombieland"") is the sweet little possum who believes in our hero.* Ned Beatty (""Toy Story 3"") is the land tortoise who is mayor of that little burg.* Timothy Olyphant (""Deadwood"") does a bang-up job voicing Clint Eastwood.* Bill Nighy (""Valkyrie"") is that evil rattlesnake.The list of voices goes on and on, with each and every one of them inspired by a great goofy script from John Logan (""Gladiator"") and direction by Gore Verbinski (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise). The animation is excellent, while everything from the music to the dialogue feels young, energetic and very funny! My DVD from Amazon is a favorite.You'll like it a lot if you like movies.

To briefly sum up the story, a chameleon embarks on a journey to find himself, winding up in the old west in a dry little town called dirt, dirt because it's bone dry because someone's siphoning its water away to the desert a la Chinatown, which this film makes parody of, among other classic films and themes.I think that what really makes this film fresh is that it's for grownups. The plot is very sophisticated, the references it makes to films like Chinatown and Apocalypse now are definitely films that most youngsters today aren't familiar with. The animals in the film, unlike most films animated in the west here, aren't cute and cuddly; they're ugly and often downright scary. Like many have pointed out here, this film was poorly--I mean POORLY--marketed. But when you think about it, when we Americans think of an animated feature we automatically assume it to be kid's stuff. Other cultures like Japanese have a more broader perspective when it comes to what's considered kids stuff, which probably explains why adults here lump anime in with ""cartoons"" that we make over here. Here's what I mean: recently, I recommended this film to a woman I know and asked her if she'd like to see it. Automatically, she said no and when I asked her why not her answer was that her 12 year old cousin saw it and didn't like it. What? I'd like to believe that as a man over 30 that my tastes would be a little more sophisticated, a little more substantial than that of a 12 year old. Go figure.Anyway, I really enjoyed this film.

Speaking of which, will Culture Club's ""Karma Chameleon"" make it onto the soundtrack?3. Some moviegoers will have a blast spotting the cornucopia of movie references ""Rango"" throws at us, particularly ""Blazing Saddles"". The Star Wars Tatooine saloon scenes, ""The Road Warrior"", ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"", and even ""Kung Fu Panda"" also come to mind. However,there is another movie from which ""Rango"" borrows its premise which I bet nobody ever considered: ""Flushed Away"" (except the danger there is too much water, not the lack of same). Check it out on IMDb, and you'll see why.4. If you have young children, instead of ""Rango"", where they'll probably fidget, yawn, and whine, take them home and pop SpongeBob Squarepants's ""Pest of the West"" episode into the DVD player instead. Same boisterous ""Rango"" premise, but much more attention-grabbing.5. In that vein the PG-rating is too lenient. I would elevate it to PG-13 for mature themes, killings, scatological humor, and risqu&eacute; references. Smart, sophisticated, irreverent moviegoers who appreciate intelligent, polysyllabic, sizzling word play will probably get the most out of ""Rango"". Stoned people, too, though of course I don't advocate this. It will probably be extremely popular at college campus film festivals in the near future.6. Most of the time, Sheriff Rango (Johnny Depp) seems to channeling the late Don Knotts's Barney Fife, or Knotts's character in ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"".7. Yep, the cinematography is even more realistic-looking than that of ""Wall-E"".8. With its menagerie of mangy, unsightly desert critters, ""Rango"" seemed to be shooting for a gross-out ""Ren and Stimpy"" or ""The Misadventures of Flapjack"" vibe.9. I went to see ""Rango"" with my mom. She liked ""Rango's"" theme of ultimately accepting responsibility. ""But, Mom"", I said, ""you were asleep for half the movie!"" ""That's okay, I was awake for the climax (the showdown with Rattlesnake Jake), the important part.""10. By the way, Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) was my favorite character in the movie. Imposing, malevolent, intimidating, he was like a venomous anaconda. Ironically, he humiliatingly and mercilessly exposes Rango's phony lawman stunt and forces him into temporary, suicidal exile, where he has an epiphany.11. As for the gigantic eye in the tunnel, it was either a heat-induced hallucination or a reference to the 1998 version of ""Godzilla"".12. Now, did I enjoy the movie? Generally, I did because it was ambitious, whip-smart, engrossing to look at, and lively. However, it was also derivative, meandering, a bit self-conscious in its humor, and sometimes difficult to hear. Still, it was worth the $6.25 I paid.P.S.: I think Rango should team up with the gecko in those Geico commercials.",3,"Ordinary Chameleon Stumbles into his Karma in the Shabby, Dry, Satirical West - Some Random Remarks",1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,2852,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***1', 'above', 'one', 'synopsis', 'Rango', 'plot.2', 'Speaking', 'will', 'Culture', 'Club', 'Karma', 'Chameleon', 'make', 'soundtrack', '3', 'moviegoers', 'will', 'have', 'blast', 'spotting', 'cornucopia', 'movie', 'references', 'Rango', 'particularly', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Tatooine', 'saloon', 'scenes', 'Road', 'Warrior', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'even', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'also', 'come', 'mind', 'However', 'movie', 'Rango', 'premise', 'bet', 'nobody', 'ever', 'considered', 'Flushed', 'Away', 'danger', 'too', 'much', 'water', 'not', 'lack', 'same', 'Check', 'out', 'IMDb', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why.4', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'instead', 'Rango', 'where', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'fidget', 'yawn', 'whine', 'take', 'home', 'pop', 'SpongeBob', 'Squarepants', 'Pest', 'West', 'episode', 'DVD', 'player', 'instead', 'Same', 'boisterous', 'Rango', 'premise', 'much', 'more', 'attention-grabbing.5', 'PG-rating', 'too', 'lenient', 'would', 'elevate', 'PG-13', 'mature', 'themes', 'killings', 'scatological', 'humor', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'references', 'Smart', 'sophisticated', 'irreverent', 'moviegoers', 'who', 'appreciate', 'intelligent', 'polysyllabic', 'sizzling', 'word', 'play', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'most', 'Rango', 'Stoned', 'people', 'too', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'advocate', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'extremely', 'popular', 'college', 'campus', 'film', 'festivals', 'near', 'future.6', 'Most', 'time', 'Sheriff', 'Rango', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'channeling', 'late', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'Knotts', 'character', 'Shakiest', 'Gun', 'West', '.7', 'Yep', 'cinematography', 'even', 'more', 'realistic-looking', 'Wall-E', '.8', 'menagerie', 'mangy', 'unsightly', 'desert', 'critters', 'Rango', 'seemed', 'be', 'shooting', 'gross-out', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'Misadventures', 'Flapjack', 'vibe.9', 'went', 'see', 'Rango', 'mom', 'liked', 'Rango', 'theme', 'ultimately', 'accepting', 'responsibility', 'Mom', 'said', 'were', 'asleep', 'movie', 'okay', 'was', 'awake', 'climax', 'showdown', 'Rattlesnake', 'Jake', 'important', 'part.', '10', 'way', 'Rattlesnake', 'Jake', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'movie', 'Imposing', 'malevolent', 'intimidating', 'was', 'venomous', 'anaconda', 'Ironically', 'humiliatingly', 'mercilessly', 'Rango', 'phony', 'lawman', 'stunt', 'temporary', 'suicidal', 'exile', 'where', 'epiphany.11', 'gigantic', 'eye', 'tunnel', 'was', 'heat-induced', 'hallucination', 'reference', '1998', 'version', 'Godzilla', '.12', 'Now', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Generally', 'did', 'was', 'ambitious', 'whip-smart', 'engrossing', 'look', 'lively', 'However', 'was', 'also', 'derivative', 'meandering', 'bit', 'self-conscious', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'hear', 'Still', 'was', 'worth', '6.25', 'paid.P.S', 'think', 'Rango', 'should', 'team', 'up', 'gecko', 'Geico', 'commercials']",N/A

1372343,A3LZBOBV9H1HDV,B003Y5H53S,"Kris King ""Kristopher""","[2, 10]","""Rango"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Rango is a sheltered chameleon living as an ordinary family pet facing a major identity crisis. After all, how high can you aim when your whole purpose in life is to blend in? When Rango accidentally winds up in the gritty, gun-slinging town of Dirt -- a lawless outpost populated by the desert's most wily and whimsical creatures -- the less-than-courageous lizard suddenly finds he stands out. Welcomed as the last hope the town has been waiting for, new Sheriff Rango is forced to play his new role to the hilt... until he starts to become the hero he once only pretended to be.The voice cast led by Johnny Depp (terrific as Rango / Lars) is excellent! The directing by Gore Verbinski (also produced and co-wrote the story) (who also directed Depp in the first three ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" movies (2003: Curse Of The Black Pearl), (2006: Dead Man's Chest) & (2007: At World's End), he also directed ""The Ring"" (2002), ""The Mexican"" (2001), ""The Weather Man"" (2005) & ""Mouse Hunt"" (1997) is excellent!

This is a funny and exciting movie that will keep you thinking and laughing at the same time. Johnny Depp gives a terrific vocal and 'emotional' (emotion capture) performance that is one of his best performances and characters that he has done, belonging alongside Jack Sparrow & Sweeney Todd.

1372345,A356RFKNIG043B,B003Y5H53S,K. Swanson,"[10, 13]","4.8 starsRango is no kids' flick, but it is a mature masterpiece in a whole bunch of ways that will soon make it a major cult favorite, guaranteed. It takes a certain sense of humor to dig this one, but if you've got it, you're in for a big big treat. Rango also has one of the best-looking, most detailed blu-ray transfers I've yet seen.A partial remake of Chinatown with existential overtones and psychedelic undercurrent with nods to dozens of cinematic classics, this ""cartoon"" Western satire has a lot more in common with Bugs Bunny and his anarchic freakiness than with any of the new crop of Pixar etc family animation works, great as they can be (Up, Incredibles). It also has Roger Rabbit's tantalizing self-reflexivity in spades and glittering diamonds. Rango salutes HST in its first scene and then goes waaaay off into left field, climbs into the bleachers, gets a beer, watches the relievers warm up, and finally scampers back down into right field and is kicked out of the ball park.For me it was a major treat, as I love Thompson, Chinatown, Warner Bros cartoons, and intelligent insanity in general. Rango piles on so many genres and ideas and spoofed cliches and wowza that your head is spinning most of the time, even if just from the truly amazing animation quality and endless wild concepts. Logan's script is so much brighter and sharper than almost anything being made lately that it seems an anachronism; its levels of thought will take your brain to many literate, self-aware clouds floating by your mind's eye.Verbinski directs the proceedings with similar aplomb, and Depp shows more voice and character range than in almost anything he's ever done. Ned Beatty is another standout, but everyone is excellent. And the various little conspiracy nods are all too accurate; there's a lot going on in Rango, and multiple viewings will show many layers of crisp detail, visually and intellectually. One might even call this a kaleidoscopic environmentalist's lament, a world-weary nod to how close to the brink we really are and a reminder that there are many other worlds out there and in here, so let's watch it Buddha-like with as much compassionate detachment as is musterable. Whatevar that means!And eye candy? Man, this is the handmade organic 75% cacao chocogasm of eye candy. Soooo much detail in some of the animals' hair and eyes that it sets a new standard (can't wait to see it in 3D). This will show off your flat screen in ways you'd never imagined. It's so good I unplugged my PS3 and took it to a friend's place just so he could see how good his flat screen can look. I wouldn't go to that trouble for just any film.Nor would I watch it twice in two days. I haven't done that in years, in fact. But I just had to check to see if Rango was as beguilingly weird and wonderful by daylight as it was late at night, and indeed it is.Rango is bound to be hailed as one of the great toon films of all time, methinks, and I'd rank it with Roger Rabbit, the best Bugs (high praise, bub!), Up and a very few other animated masterpieces. Is it for kids? Not really, unless you'd like to raise them to be smarter and more self-aware than the average little texting robots these days, so, you know, be careful! I think many kids are much brighter much earlier than we think, but then again I watched a lot of Bugs as a kid, so I may be biased.If you've got a blu-ray player, at least rent this just to see how good your screen can look. And if you happen to get your mind blown in the process, well, lucky you!

Both me and my 10 y.o. daughter we spend a great cinema moment together watching ""Rango"" and I recommend this movie for a whole family evening, as it is a typical ""kidult"" (kid+adult) movie. In fact, when I looked, there were more adults than kids in the cinema and they were all having a really great time!The reasons why this movie is so good are many, and I will try to enumerate the more important, avoiding the spoilers as much as possible:1) It is a really really good, solid classical western, with all the necessary ingredients: a lawless town (named Dirt), a mysterious lone stranger, a cemetery filled with dead sheriffs, a cute (although tough) senorita in dire straits, a bank robbery, a saloon filled with the scum of the earth, a joyful merry undertaker (which is only normal - his is the only prospering business in Dirt), a deadly evil gunfighter who ALWAYS ""takes a soul"" in every town he visits, an Indian tracker (who molts, but we shall not hold it against him, shall we?) and also desperadoes, buzzards, posses, dynamite, old timers with shotguns, youngsters with Colts, hillbillies with Gatling machine guns, booze galore, Far West stories, coffee and beans around a campfire, mariachis on the cactuses and let's not forget the seven brothers killed with one bullet...)))2) Johny Depp gives to Rango more than just his voice - this lizard IS Johny Depp! And also by placing in his mouth some of the lines from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", Johny Depp made me relieve some of the best moments of this franchise. There were moments when I half expected seeing Barbossa behind that Gatling machine gun!3) The Spirit of the West - as a wise old armadillo called Roadkill teaches Rango, ""the Spirit of the West rides in a white chariot with a guard of golden warriors"" - and indeed he does! And I guarantee you that when you finally meet yourself the Spirit of the West you will spill the soda on your pants and choke on your popcorn, like half of the public did (me included) when we were watching it in the cinema! I almost died laughing at this moment (although my daughter did not get the joke - and I think most of the kids will not get it either). No more spoilers here about The Spirit of the West!4) Visually and graphically this is a very well done movie, quite unique in style, unlike anything else made by Pixar or Dreamworks. In fact I really hope that Nickelodeon Movies will carry on, because this style of movie making completes very pleasantly the offer on the market of kid (and kidult) movies. VERY good job on the visual aspect of this movie!To keep the things short I will not say much more and I will just invite you to see it in the cinema if you still can and then to enjoy it on DVD. And I am all in favor of a sequel, in which we could hear for example an old grumpy one eyed rat saying: ""Fill yer hands, rascals!"" before charging ahead with his Colts blazing!",5,"Discover your inner lizard and hit the Dirt, gringo - but beware of bullets, buzzards, bats and bullfrogs by bushels!",1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,2973,"['expected', 'lot', 'duo', 'Verbinski/Depp', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', '10', 'y.o', 'daughter', 'spend', 'great', 'cinema', 'moment', 'together', 'watching', 'Rango', 'recommend', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'evening', 'typical', 'kidult', 'kid+adult', 'movie', 'fact', 'when', 'looked', 'were', 'more', 'adults', 'kids', 'cinema', 'were', 'having', 'really', 'great', 'time', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'are', 'many', 'will', 'try', 'enumerate', 'more', 'important', 'avoiding', 'spoilers', 'as', 'much', 'possible:1', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'solid', 'classical', 'western', 'necessary', 'ingredients', 'lawless', 'town', 'named', 'Dirt', 'mysterious', 'lone', 'stranger', 'cemetery', 'filled', 'dead', 'sheriffs', 'cute', 'tough', 'senorita', 'dire', 'straits', 'bank', 'robbery', 'saloon', 'filled', 'scum', 'earth', 'joyful', 'merry', 'undertaker', 'only', 'normal', 'only', 'prospering', 'business', 'Dirt', 'deadly', 'evil', 'gunfighter', 'who', 'ALWAYS', 'soul', 'town', 'Indian', 'tracker', 'who', 'molts', 'shall', 'not', 'hold', 'shall', 'also', 'desperadoes', 'buzzards', 'posses', 'dynamite', 'old', 'timers', 'shotguns', 'youngsters', 'Colts', 'Gatling', 'machine', 'guns', 'booze', 'galore', 'Far', 'West', 'stories', 'coffee', 'beans', 'campfire', 'mariachis', 'cactuses', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'seven', 'brothers', 'killed', 'one', 'bullet', '2', 'Johny', 'Depp', 'Rango', 'more', 'just', 'voice', 'lizard', 'Johny', 'Depp', 'also', 'placing', 'mouth', 'lines', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Johny', 'Depp', 'made', 'relieve', 'best', 'moments', 'franchise', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'half', 'expected', 'seeing', 'Barbossa', 'Gatling', 'machine', 'gun', '3', 'Spirit', 'West', 'wise', 'old', 'armadillo', 'called', 'Roadkill', 'teaches', 'Rango', 'Spirit', 'West', 'rides', 'white', 'chariot', 'guard', 'golden', 'warriors', 'indeed', 'guarantee', 'when', 'finally', 'meet', 'Spirit', 'West', 'will', 'spill', 'soda', 'pants', 'choke', 'popcorn', 'half', 'public', 'did', 'included', 'when', 'were', 'watching', 'cinema', 'almost', 'died', 'laughing', 'moment', 'daughter', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'joke', 'think', 'most', 'kids', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'No', 'more', 'spoilers', 'here', 'Spirit', 'West', '4', 'Visually', 'graphically', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'quite', 'unique', 'style', 'anything', 'else', 'made', 'Pixar', 'Dreamworks', 'fact', 'really', 'hope', 'Nickelodeon', 'Movies', 'will', 'carry', 'style', 'movie', 'making', 'completes', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'offer', 'market', 'kid', 'kidult', 'movies', 'VERY', 'good', 'job', 'visual', 'aspect', 'movie', 'keep', 'things', 'short', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'will', 'just', 'invite', 'see', 'cinema', 'still', 'can', 'then', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'am', 'favor', 'sequel', 'could', 'hear', 'example', 'old', 'grumpy', 'one', 'eyed', 'rat', 'saying', 'Fill', 'yer', 'hands', 'rascals', 'charging', 'ahead', 'Colts', 'blazing']",N/A

Rango, a lizard like no lizard you've ever seen, lives in a terrarium with a wind-up goldfish and a headless nude Barbie-style doll, acting out little dramas he dreams up with his plastic friends. One day his world is literally shattered as the terrarium falls out of the back of the family station wagon and breaks on a little-traveled road in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Rango finds himself in Dirt, a town running out of water and in desperate need of a hero. The acting skills Rango honed in his terrarium enable him to convince the townsfolk that he's a hero. Now he has to find out if he can really be the hero they need.The plot, such as it is, is a pastiche of ""High Noon,"" Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, and especially ""Chinatown."" If you are not familiar with these decidedly adult-oriented films, much of the pleasure of ""Rango"" will be lost on you. The cleverly derivative script is filled with verbal gymnastics and philosophy served up by a roadkill armadillo and a Man With No Name.I can't even come up with a word that doesn't sound trite to describe the animation--WOW!! This is a fabulous movie to look at. Every character has so much detail and originality. Coen Brothers stalwart Roger Deakins acted as the cinematography consultant and it shows in every frame. Johnny Depp heads a voice cast of great actors including Ned Beatty and Harry Dean Stanton.""Rango"" has enough physical humor and action to keep my eight-year-old entertained, but I know many of the jokes and all of the classic film references went over his head. The language is nothing my kid does not hear in a traffic jam, and to the extent the humor is crude, it is usually expressed with such sophisticated wordplay that I did not find it particularly offensive. There was a big chase scene, a cast-of-thousands set piece of the type in which director Gore Verbinski specializes in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" that is uncomfortably violent. There are also pleasantly surprising moments of quiet reflection and introspection that, based on the relatively cartoonish quality of the ""Pirates"" movies, I did not expect from Verbinski.I can enthusiastically recommend Rango for film buffs and for kids whose parents are not highly protective when it comes to mild swearing and violence. I ended with a four-star rating because, although Rango is surprisingly thoughtful and beautifully done in many ways, it bothered me that instead of having a wholly original story, they cobbled the script together from the plots of other movies.

Really, a pretty amazing accomplishment.

Being based to such a great degree on Chinatown probably elevated it in many of those critics eyes as well but, since I don't really care for Chinatown, while I could appreciate the references, I wished that, if the filmmakers needed to copy a classic film, they had copied a one I like.

Although rated PG much of it is risqu&eacute; in a subtle way.  For parents who watch films with kids, this is one of the best.  The kiddies won't understand much of the humor, but the parents will be laughing.Rango (voiced by Johnny Depp) is a chameleon on a road trip with his owners when he is unceremoniously bounced off the vehicle in the middle of the desert.  Not used to the barren, hot surroundings he encounters a string of friendly animals (Alfred Molina is great as ""Roadkill"") as well as not so friendly predators before finding his way to Dirt, a dying town full of worn out talking animals.  One is a cute female lizard of some type (tan rather than green) named Beans (Isla Fisher).Dirt's water supply has been cut off and the town and inhabitants are withering away.  Rango is appointed sheriff and vows to find out what happened to the water.  It turns out that the town's mayor (Ned Beatty, a turtle) has diverted the water to supply a big city (Las Vegas) nearby.  Rango, Beans and others search for a way to get the water back to town and encounter Balthazar, a shrew (Harry Dean Stanton) who is believed to be the culprit along with his numerous ""relatives.""  These scenes are fast moving, hilarious and look great.This all leads to a not surprising conclusion when the mayor brings in Rattlesnake Jake (the great Bill Nighy) to confront Rango and Beans who is the lone holdout to sell her property.  Recommended for kids and adults.I would urge you to get the Blu ray version of this movie (I have the one that includes an extended cut).  It is spectacular in every sense of the word.  It happens I was test driving this movie on a new display with a new player and AV receiver and couldn't have picked a better film.  The video comes in 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Every animated skin bump, hair, dirt are shockingly clear and colorful.  Likewise the audio is perfection.  Check out the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 for another example of as good as it gets.  Crisp and clear throughout, the soundtrack is properly center and the use of the surrounds and sub is appropriate for the scenes.  Quiet sounds like a fly buzzing, a fan moving are perfectly executed.  Both the video and audio are demo grade.  The film has Spanish, Portuguese, English SDH and French subtitles available.

1372384,A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,B003Y5H53S,Monkdude,"[12, 16]","Rango is one of the most pleasantly weird animated movies I've ever seen. It's basically a throwback western with enough grit to make Rooster Cogburn blush.The visuals are gorgeous, courtesy of ILM (this being their first animated feature), with some of the characters looking more Muppet like than a creation of CGI. Maybe the closest I've seen to reaching the high standards of Pixar, but boy are they not pretty to look at. You can practically smell them.The story is very simple and similar to almost every western made, but the various strange looking inhabitants and clever dialogue carry most of the film. And yes, it's more clever than laugh out loud funny. In fact, most of the jokes seemed to have been missed by the people sitting around me. They are quick and often thrown out with a strong accent so you'll have to really pay attention.The voice cast is full of familiar names, but Johnny Depp as the title character deserves mention. He could have phoned this thing in and still made millions, but instead it seems that he put every ounce of energy and craft he possessed in creating a voice that's both memorable and interesting to listen to.This may seem strange, but Rango isn't made with kids in mind. Almost all of the jokes and references are aimed at adults. Likewise, the language, violence and all around meanness will likely upset small children and the parents that might be caught off guard. If The Dark Knight was a hard PG-13, this pushes PG to the limits. Some older kids might enjoy it, but like I said, most just won't get it.If it doesn't get forgotten due to the early release date, this could pop up for an animated film Oscar.

1372397,AHF97M45JFCB,B003Y5H53S,ONENEO,"[2, 4]","When you think of the heavy hitters in the animated feature film realm, it's certainly understandable if the first things that come to mind are Disney, Pixar or DreamWorks.  However Nickelodeon has been hovering around the scene for a while now, hoping to earn a nice piece of the CG animated movie pie.Rango is by far their most serious attempt and while the film's deserved PG-13 rating may succeed at distancing it from its key demographic (a concept all studios would be wise to emulate from industry-leader Pixar).The story follows the comical, transformative journey of Rango (Depp), a sheltered chameleon living as an ordinary family pet, while facing a major identity crisis.  After all, how high can you aim when your whole purpose in life is to blend in?  When Rango accidentally winds up in the gritty, gun-slinging town of Dirt, a lawless outpost populated by the desert's wiliest whimsical creatures, the less-than-courageous lizard suddenly finds that he's been preparing for this role his whole life.  Welcomed as the last hope the whole town has been awaiting, the newly appointed Sheriff Rango is forced to play his new role as if it life depended on it.  In fact, it does!  In a blaze of action-packed situations and encounters with outrageous characters, Rango starts to become the hero he's always pretended to be.If you didn't already know, this piece represents Gore Verbinski's first film since concluding his Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy in 2007 and represented an ideal opportunity for him to continue working with the oddly charismatic Johnny Depp.Like the Pirates trilogy, Verbinski proves strangely proficient at developing properties that seem almost kid-friendly but continually flirt with adult-only ideals and references.  In fact those viewers expecting a wild-west themed variation of a typical Disney/ Pixar feature will be in for a bit of rude awakening.  Rather than craft an action-driven kids movie peppered with adult humor and pop culture references, Rango is boldly unrepentant for the various tones and complexities it explores.Industrial Light and Magic does a spectacular job with the look of the film, with drab landscapes and gritty character textures and while the John Logan script is funny at times, appreciation of this film depends heavily on the viewer's feeling towards old spaghetti westerns.The pacing is deliberately drawn out and littered with crusty townsfolk, children will likely find the prose a bit too dull to hold their interest even before the objectionable language and references have a chance to upset them.  In fact, a strong argument could be made that this is very nearly like watching a genuine old western film with personified animals transplanted over black and white live action sequences.  Further contributing to the sensation is an extended version release on the DVD & Blu-Ray that comes in at just under two-hours.I personally enjoyed the idea of a desert down finding so much value in water that it has literally become currency and there's no denying that, while a bit hideous, there is some serious brilliance in the character design models.Of course despite the film's rambling philosophies and lackluster supporting characters, Rango has its moments thanks in no small part to solid vocal deliveries from Depp, Ned Beatty, and Wedding Crashers' Isla Fisher.There are some slapstick moments to keep the kiddies in their seats even if the western puns and clich&eacute;s will be lost upon them.  Adults may get a kick out of a few of the exchanges although truthfully, they can be a bit over the top, eliciting some ""ewwws"" even out of teens at times.In conclusion some of the finest computer generated visuals to date (there is a segment depicting a human that is nearly photo-realistic), Rango lacks the type of cleverness that makes many of Pixar and DreamWorks' pieces so timeless.  Adults who appreciate modern animation (especially those with a fondness for western classics) will find much to enjoy here but contrary to the Nickelodeon backing, kids aren't the target audience for this one.",4,"Thematic, Pretty And Not For Everyone",1314748800,"08 31, 2011",2011,4086,"['When', 'think', 'heavy', 'hitters', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'realm', 'certainly', 'understandable', 'first', 'things', 'come', 'mind', 'are', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'DreamWorks', 'However', 'Nickelodeon', 'been', 'hovering', 'scene', 'while', 'now', 'hoping', 'earn', 'nice', 'piece', 'CG', 'animated', 'movie', 'pie.Rango', 'far', 'most', 'serious', 'attempt', 'film', 'deserved', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'may', 'succeed', 'distancing', 'key', 'demographic', 'concept', 'studios', 'would', 'be', 'wise', 'emulate', 'industry-leader', 'Pixar', '.The', 'story', 'comical', 'transformative', 'journey', 'Rango', 'Depp', 'sheltered', 'chameleon', 'living', 'ordinary', 'family', 'pet', 'facing', 'major', 'identity', 'crisis', 'how', 'high', 'can', 'aim', 'when', 'whole', 'purpose', 'life', 'blend', 'When', 'Rango', 'accidentally', 'up', 'gritty', 'gun-slinging', 'town', 'Dirt', 'lawless', 'outpost', 'populated', 'desert', 'wiliest', 'whimsical', 'creatures', 'less-than-courageous', 'lizard', 'suddenly', 'been', 'preparing', 'role', 'whole', 'life', 'Welcomed', 'last', 'hope', 'whole', 'town', 'been', 'awaiting', 'newly', 'appointed', 'Sheriff', 'Rango', 'forced', 'play', 'new', 'role', 'life', 'depended', 'fact', 'blaze', 'action-packed', 'situations', 'encounters', 'outrageous', 'characters', 'Rango', 'become', 'hero', 'always', 'pretended', 'be.If', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'piece', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'first', 'film', 'concluding', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'trilogy', '2007', 'represented', 'ideal', 'opportunity', 'continue', 'working', 'oddly', 'charismatic', 'Johnny', 'Depp.Like', 'Pirates', 'trilogy', 'Verbinski', 'strangely', 'proficient', 'developing', 'properties', 'seem', 'almost', 'kid-friendly', 'continually', 'flirt', 'adult-only', 'ideals', 'references', 'fact', 'viewers', 'expecting', 'wild-west', 'themed', 'variation', 'typical', 'Disney/', 'Pixar', 'feature', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'rude', 'awakening', 'Rather', 'craft', 'action-driven', 'kids', 'movie', 'peppered', 'adult', 'humor', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'Rango', 'boldly', 'unrepentant', 'various', 'tones', 'complexities', 'explores.Industrial', 'Light', 'Magic', 'spectacular', 'job', 'look', 'film', 'drab', 'landscapes', 'gritty', 'character', 'textures', 'John', 'Logan', 'script', 'funny', 'times', 'appreciation', 'film', 'heavily', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'towards', 'old', 'spaghetti', 'westerns.The', 'pacing', 'deliberately', 'drawn', 'out', 'littered', 'crusty', 'townsfolk', 'children', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'prose', 'bit', 'too', 'dull', 'hold', 'interest', 'even', 'objectionable', 'language', 'references', 'have', 'chance', 'upset', 'fact', 'strong', 'argument', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'very', 'nearly', 'watching', 'genuine', 'old', 'western', 'film', 'personified', 'animals', 'transplanted', 'black', 'white', 'live', 'action', 'sequences', 'Further', 'contributing', 'sensation', 'extended', 'version', 'release', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'just', 'two-hours.I', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'idea', 'desert', 'down', 'finding', 'so', 'much', 'value', 'water', 'literally', 'become', 'currency', 'denying', 'bit', 'hideous', 'serious', 'brilliance', 'character', 'design', 'models.Of', 'course', 'film', 'rambling', 'philosophies', 'lackluster', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Rango', 'moments', 'thanks', 'small', 'part', 'solid', 'vocal', 'deliveries', 'Depp', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Isla', 'Fisher.There', 'are', 'slapstick', 'moments', 'keep', 'kiddies', 'seats', 'even', 'western', 'puns', 'clich', 'eacute', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'Adults', 'may', 'get', 'kick', 'few', 'exchanges', 'truthfully', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'top', 'eliciting', 'ewwws', 'even', 'teens', 'times.In', 'conclusion', 'finest', 'computer', 'generated', 'visuals', 'date', 'segment', 'depicting', 'human', 'nearly', 'photo-realistic', 'Rango', 'type', 'cleverness', 'many', 'Pixar', 'DreamWorks', 'pieces', 'so', 'timeless', 'Adults', 'who', 'appreciate', 'modern', 'animation', 'especially', 'fondness', 'western', 'classics', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'enjoy', 'here', 'contrary', 'Nickelodeon', 'backing', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'target', 'audience', 'one']",N/A

Recognizing that appreciation of humor differs, I laughed a lot at this movie, as did my 22 year old daughter.  My in-laws, who are in their eighties, perhaps not so much.  I found the dialogue clever and witty, the photography stunning, and the voice acting terrific.  This film is rated PG, which I would say warns parents of young children to check it out before they expose their children to it. My opinion is that it is perfectly appropriate for age 10 and above (Netflix Common Sense rating says ok for 9+).Remembering back to films with adult themes I thought exciting and entertaining as a kid, I think of Ben-Hur, Guns of Navarone, Jason and the Argonauts, Hondo and Rio Bravo.  I'm talking about such themes as self sacrifice, bravery in the face of danger, self doubt, and good versus evil.  This film has all of those themes and presents them in an exciting, funny and entertaining manner.  No, I would not take a five year old to see this. I took my daughter to see The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast when she was likely a little young for them.  She was scared a few times, but entertained. Consider the Star Wars films, or the Toy Story trilogy, which also present many of the same themes, and which are considered good ""family"")as opposed to ""children's) films. Consider the brilliantly animated films of Hayao Miyazaki, most of which are also rated PG, but universally praised as great family films.I urge anyone who really likes movies, especially Westerns, to see this film.  If you're wondering if this is appropriate for your children or grandchildren, check it out first.  My opinion is that if you disregard the rating system, and simply assume that a film is appropriate just because it's animated, then any bad surprise is on your own head.

An oddball pet chameleon (Depp) is accidentally left stranded in the middle of the scorching Mojave Desert and wanders to a small town inhabited by desert animals, where he assumes the identity of a tough drifter named Rango. After killing a fierce hawk out of sheer dumb luck, Rango is named the town's newest sheriff, and attempts to solve the water shortage that has placed the town in the brink of despair. Rango is the funniest animated family movie of 2011. Verbinski delivers a crowd-pleasing animated spectacle with a fun-filled storyline, amusing characters, stunning computer animation and a fine comical performance by Johnny Depp. Rango also features the voice talents of Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Ned Beatty, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, Stephen Root, Harry Dean Stanton and Timothy Olyphant.It wouldn't be right calling the Blu-ray release of Rango anything but one of the best Blu-rays of the year. The theatrical and extended versions are included in this release. The animated comedy is presented in a 2.40:1 widescreen format. The 1080p transfer is absolutely flawless and gorgeous. The DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack will surely satisfy the needs of home theater enthusiasts. The Blu-ray includes a fine selection of bonus features like an audio commentary track by director Gore Verbinski and production crew, the 2-part making-of featurette ""Breaking the Rules: Making Animation History"", 8 and a half minutes of deleted scenes, picture-in-picture storyboards, and a n interactive tour of the town of Dirt and its townsfolk.

1372424,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B003Y5H53S,RJ Smoove,"[5, 6]","Where to begin with Rango? I intentionally avoided it when it was in theaters for no good reason, other than the fact that I knew I would buy it when it came out on Blu-ray, and I figured I would save myself some money since I was not dying to see it. In some ways that may have contributed to me loving the film so much after only a couple of viewings. It's definitely my new favorite Western, as hard as that may be to believe. Rango takes many aspects from classic Westerns and reiterates them through fresh, and often funny ways. I'll briefly summarize the plot. The story revolves around a pet chameleon (voiced by Johnny Depp at the top of his game) who becomes stranded in the Mojave Desert after his terrarium is thrown from his owner's car. After meeting an armadillo named Roadkill (voiced by Alfred Molina), who is seeking the mystical Spirit of the West, he narrowly avoids being eaten by a hawk before meeting another lizard, named Beans (voiced by Isla Fisher). Beans then takes Rango to Dirt, a small, Old West town populated by a colorful cast of various species of desert animals (watch the ""Real Creatures of Dirt"" featurette in the extras to see their real-life counterparts), whom each has their own different personality, look, and shall I say, walk? That's a joke that ties into an early gag when Rango first arrives at Dirt. There is quite a bit of quirky, offbeat humor throughout, and that caught me off guard. I had a lot of fun watching this movie. More so than I expected to. I have to say, this may just be the most gorgeously animated film that I have ever seen.It's my dream to be an animator and a visual effects artist after I finish college, and to witness the magnificent work on display in this film was a real treat. This may be controversial because Pixar is backed by legions of fans (myself included), but honestly, if ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) worked on more animated films, they would dominate the industry. It's quite funny to me that the very same visual effects house (founded by none other than George Lucas) that gave us Pixar, arguably the best in the business at what they do (which is the whole package of story and animation, not just animation), has made one of the few films that I think looks more visually arresting than anything they have done. It's also ironic that this film is so beautiful, because it has the ugliest cast of characters that I have ever seen in an animated film. Not only the characters, but the scenery has a rugged beauty as well. In the town, Dirt, Gore Verbinski (Director) said that he didn't want any parallel lines or 90 degree angles. He wanted it to show that this ugly little town was not made by expert craftsmen. It was made by animals. It's so incredibly rich and detailed that it's hard not to ogle at it. There are some very well-done action sequences in this film, and I must say that the bat scene is not to be missed. It's quite obvious that this movie is not aiming its focus at little children, in more ways than one. The director himself said so on the commentary, but before I listened to that, I thought that. First of all, as I already mentioned, these characters are not visually appealing, so they probably won't want a plush doll of any of them, except for maybe Rango. He literally is the only character in the film with some color.Another reason why I felt this film was not aiming itself at children was the writing itself. There are so many big words throughout this film that even some older kids and adults will have to look them up. Definitely a few lines that parents will have to explain to their kids later. I can hear it now. ""Mommy, what's a prostate?"" ""Oh, um, I'll tell you in a few years..."" ""Okay, but what about a mammogram?"" ""Oh dear God, this is supposed to be a cartoon."" And that's where the parent would be wrong. If ever there was a perfect example that not all animated films are for little children, Rango would be it. In one of the bonus features, Verbinski said a quote that I have said a few times, so it really stood out to me. He said, ""Animation is not a genre. It's a technique to tell a story."" I wish more people would understand this, because it's disappointing when someone won't even give an animated film a chance because they think it's for little kids. On another note, film buffs should, especially Western buffs, should have a ball looking for all of the references to other films, none of which a kid would catch (wink, wink). I definitely couldn't catch them all, so I looked them up. I'll name the ones I found (without spoiling what parts they appear in). There are references to: The Man With No Name Trilogy (referenced quite a few times, in various ways), John Wayne cowboy films in general, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Chinatown, Cat Ballou, High Noon, The Shakiest Gun in the West, Apocalypse Now, Pirates of the Caribbean, Aliens. As you can see, there are plenty to look for, and that probably isn't all of them. Rango is exciting, charming, funny, and fresh. I will definitely be returning to it many times in the coming years.There is no reason to go into great detail here. The movie has enough detail to the point where the animators could probably have taken out a bit of the various textures and fine details, and the movie would probably still be ahead of its competition. The picture quality is simply flawless (no exaggeration). If there was a level above perfection, Rango would be there. I've already said enough about how beautiful and detailed the animations are, and the transfer brings it life very, very well. I'd recommend this Blu-ray just as a reference to show off to friends and family who still buy DVDs. I'd be willing to bet my left nut that it would convert at least one of them. Rescue one of them from the Dark Side. All kidding aside, it truly is a sight to behold. I also want to commend the creators for not succumbing to the 3D craze, and filming Rango in 3D. Even though we always have a choice as to whether or not we want to watch a film in the format, and I pretty much always choose to watch animated films in 3D (so forgive my hypocrisy), it's undeniable that filmmakers spend time tinkering with the 3D that they would otherwise have spent on another aspect of the film. So I'm happy that all of their time was spent perfecting other aspects of Rango. As for the audio, it's top notch as well. Admittedly, I don't have the greatest sound system, but I did not notice any glaring flaws with the audio either, so I have to say it's flawless as well. The extras are also pretty damn good. I almost never watch extras right after the film ends, but I did with Rango.I started with the ""Real Creatures of Dirt"" featurette. It was actually pretty cool. It was a fairly short (about the length of a half hour TV show with no commercials) and was in the style of the old Zoboomafoo show from PBS, with a Steve Irwin twist (dangerously close, in other words). Next up was the ""Breaking the Rules: Making Animation History"" featurette, which was your standard ""Making of"" fair. Both were fun to watch, and will definitely strengthen your love for the film if you like it. It was quite interesting to see the creative way they filmed the actors on a sound stage acting out the entire film, then used the footage for reference when doing the animations. It was almost like motion capture, without the tights suits and little dot markers. Johnny Depp is hilarious to watch. His facial expressions really sell his commitment to the character. I also listened to the audio commentary. It was fun to listen to, and while fans will learn a few interesting tidbits here and there, I wouldn't say it's a necessity. So, all in all, Rango is an all-around satisfying film. It's funny and witty, with fresh humor that isn't often found in animated films. It's often exciting with thrilling chases and square-offs (as all great Westerns do). It has gorgeous scenery (some of the most realistic CGI environments that I have ever seen). And most importantly, it should be entertaining for the whole family, but adults should get more out of it than young children, I give Rango my highest recommendation.

More detective work takes them near Las Vegas where the valve from which the underground pipes lead to,has been turned off.It seems the mayor and his cronies who have been running Dirt for years,have been hoarding the water for themselves and using it as a control carrot on the rest of the townspeople.The valve is turned back on and before you know it the entire town and surrounding area is water saturated for the first time in years.The mayors control,and life,comes crashing down around his ears and Rango becomes Dirts hero.Deft in script and animation,the film does start off rather slowly as we start to learn about this strange actor wanna be/chameleon.Once he hits the desert,the film picks up considerably and never stops until the end.There is alot of humour here that would go over the head of youngsters and as it comes in at 111 minutes in length,I doubt whether the younger set could sit still long enough to stay with this film.There are alot of neat touches though like the Mariachi Owl band that comes in and out of the film,singing of Rango and his imminent death,and Rango's meeting with the Man with No Name or the legendary Spirit of the West.This is,of course,Clint Eastwood's famous character(voiced by Tim Olyphant).He is dressed in his Man with No name regalia from his 60s movies,with a metal detector in hand and driving a golf cart with his OSCARS in the back!Now I know there are few if any younger than twenty years old that would get that reference.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp,the animation just awesome and it is in its original w/s a/r.Extras include a featurette on the real denizens of the desert,the original theatrical and extended versions and 10 deleted scenes.In point of fact,the deleted scenes here are just those extras from the extended version.All in all a recommended animation charmer.Depp is wonderful as the lead lizard here,and the world of Dirt and the intrigue of the films plot,keep you interested from the moment he enters the town to the end of the film.Above all the animation is superb.",4,3 1/2 -4 stars for this lovable animated entry!,1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,4342,"['Rango', 'released',

1372427,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003Y5H53S,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Rango (Gore Verbinski, 2011)Rango is something very rare in the current American culture: an animated movie created specifically for grown-ups. Thankfully, it's also brilliant, the kind of movie that provides hard evidence that such a thing can still work in American film culture. Artistically, at least; while the movie performed relatively well at the box office, it didn't make back its budget theatrically. I hope that doesn't doom Industrial Light and Magic's animation department to the dustbin, because Rango is the best American animated movie in a decade.Plot: Rango (voice of Johnny Depp)&#8212;though he is not named Rango at the beginning of the film (he is unnamed in the first part of the film, and this is not trivial)&#8212;is a pet chameleon on a roadtrip through the desert when a near-miss car accident sends his tank out of his owners' RV. The previously-pampered pet with an acting aspiration very quickly learns that the outside world is a different place indeed than he is used to. After an encounter with the  plucky, if somewhat insane, Beans (Now You See Me's Isla Fisher), he accompanies her back to her hometown of Dirt, where he spins a few tall tales and somehow finds himself talked into accepting the job of town sheriff. Can the newly-christened Rango use his chameleon nature to truly become the brave, heroic lizard he has made himself out to be, save the town's dwimdling water supply, and stand up to local villain Rattlesnake Jake (Hot Fuzz' Bill Nighy)?Impeccable comic timing (it's obvious Verbinski took the Robin-Williams-in-Aladdin approach here of &#8220;give the cast their scripts, let them ad-lib their hearts out, and then animate around it&#8221;), gorgeously detailed animation, dozens of in-jokes for movie buffs. Rango has pretty much everything you could want in a comedy. And while the kiddies will certainly enjoy the bright colors and the chaos, this is old-school-Looney-Tunes humor, written with the intelligence and wit to be funny enough for the kids but with veiled (and sometimes not so veiled) more adult humor lying just underneath the surface for the adults as well.

Witness the stream of 3-D computer-generated animations that beg for our attention.  And then Rango saunters onto the scene.  Like the dry wasteland this self-proclaimed lizard hero enters, so is the domain of contending cgi comic iterations assaulting our senses.The first daring and glorious decision the cool kids at Nickelodeon and Blind Wink made was to forgo 3-D for a bright, crisp, highly detailed and daringly artistic two dimensional world that verges between the merely surreal and a full-blown lucid fever dream.  I couldn't help but think of Carlos Costeneda.Directed with a loose hand by Gore Verbinski from a terrifically unhinged screenplay by John Logan (THE AVIATOR) the story follows a pet lizard, a terrarium-bound, hipster, stand-up chameleon in a Hawaiian shirt (and no pants) with dreams of going on a hero's adventure a la Joseph Campbell's mythic conceit.  Suddenly, out of the blue, an accident thrusts him into his adventure.  Rango goes without a name for a while and then defines himself as western gunslinger Rango who will save the town of Dirt from its manufactured drought.  Yes, Rango is true to the beats of the mythic hero's journey and true to form, finally brings the elixir to the desperate town's inhabitants of semi-civilized varmints and assorted desert dwellers -- all of whom are voiced and designed with a finesse rarely seen.The thing that I really liked about Rango -- the character and the movie -- is that all the self-referential material, the homages and the sly winks to the adult audience never seemed in any way contrived or condescending.  It was part of the tapestry from frame one.Rango is a terrific icon of our shared, post-modern, existential dilemma of not being able to escape our own story.  I love that.  But ironically, the film allows us to do just that - even if for only 90 or so minutes.

But then, they never really got any further than that story wise.To be fair, it's a bit more story than Pirates three, but not one that needed to be told.

An unfortunate accident throws him out of his interior world and though he does not know it yet, gives him the purpose he has always craved.After some chat with a philosophical armadillo, he makes it to Dirt, a western town that must copy stereotypical characters from just about every western film you've ever seen, which is a good thing!Animation:I loved this animation!  Pixar look out!  The attention to detail down to the fire sparks from burned logs, sand and water, even pupils dilating.  Amazing detail and all in glorious 2D (remember 2D?)!Fav Scenes:The story has a few nods to other films that the older viewers may catch, including a parody of Apocalypse Now, with flying bats playing Ride of the Valkeries as they shoot up the good guys trying to get their stolen water back.Rango is an actor and convinces the town that he is a hero and through a few lucky breaks such as killing the local hawk that has been dining on the citizens, they all consider him so.  The slimy mayor however has other plans and is dealing a vicious hand to the detriment of the whole town.  There are some slapstick moments, and a few lines are hilarious:""Is this heaven?""""No.  Eating PopTarts with Kim Novak is heaven!""Themes:Pretending to be someone you're not may get you aways, but really finding out who you really are is a start to respect for yourself and others.

You have to wonder if the writer of Rango is a fan of the Coen brothers, and was intentionally aiming for that.There is a moment in the movie where Rango reminds me a bit of Barney Fife (the late, great Don Knotts' ""The Andy Griffith Show"" character).The animation by Industrial Light & Magic is fantastic.

Dirt: a backwater, no-water, lawless outpost of the old west, and Rango: a terrarium bred chameleon with thespian ambitions. When Rango's fast mouth gets the better of him he finds you can't just talk your way into being a hero.And...Rango is an adult Western. Doesn't matter about the sumptuously animated characters or the beautifully realised backgrounds what we have here, pure and simple, is Shane, the Dollars Westerns of Sergio Leone and any number of generic archetypes you care to name (The Three Amigos also comes to mind!) As such i'm a little confused as to who the target audience for Rango is. There is nothing cute here to sell to the kiddies - no cuddly toys or lunch boxes to promote, far too many adults also still think animation is somehow sub-par film making and it will pass them by, it hasn't been advertised much as a Western so fans there are likely to miss out. Which leaves only rabid Johnny Depp and Gore Verbinski fans (connoisseurs!) and that's a great shame as Rango is a brilliant movie aimed far more at an adult and Western fans audience than at the child/teen market.All the best bits go completely over the heads of the younger audience. The whole Western pastiche will be unfamiliar to many: extreme, frame filling close ups, dirty saloons, fast talking, mariachi music, swearing and death! The 'Spirit of the West' left nearly all the adults in the theatre spitting popcorn ad laughing. The earlier ""Fear and Loathing"" skit cracked up another significant proportion of the adult audience leaving the kids scratching their heads. Bill Nighy steals every scene turning in an Oscar worthy performance as the genuinely scary (scary as in: will give children nightmares scary) Rattlesnake Jake: ""Go to hell!"" ""Where d'you think i come from?"" Ned Beatty adds considerable menace as the mayor and even the overall characterisation and design errs more on the side of harsh reality than fluffy fancyisms.The overarching theme of a town of animals in the Nevada desert, bled dry of water by the march of 'progress', will also pass many by; but may also plant a few seeds ;)The film does have plenty to satisfy older children too. But for once it is these bits that feel like they have been shoe-horned into an adult movie, rather than vice versa. As such Rango falls between two stools being neither dramatic nor intelligent enough to be a genuine adult pastiche, nor foolishly funny or endearing enough to satisfy children. However the good bits are genius and the bad bits merely 'just' entertaining which gives Rango real 5-star appeal!",5,The first great animated Western?,1301356800,"03 29, 2011",2011,2669,"['When', 'Lizard', 'name', 'strode', 'dry', 'town', 'Dirt', 'would', 'change', 'forever', 'Dirt', 'backwater', 'no-water', 'lawless', 'outpost', 'old', 'west', 'Rango', 'terrarium', 'bred', 'chameleon', 'thespian', 'ambitions', 'When', 'Rango', 'fast', 'mouth', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'talk', 'way', 'being', 'hero.And', 'Rango', 'adult', 'Western', 'Does', ""n't"", 'matter', 'sumptuously', 'animated', 'characters', 'beautifully', 'realised', 'backgrounds', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'pure', 'simple', 'Shane', 'Dollars', 'Westerns', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'number', 'generic', 'archetypes', 'care', 'name', 'Three', 'Amigos', 'also', 'mind', 'such', 'i', ""'m"", 'little', 'confused', 'who', 'target', 'audience', 'Rango', 'nothing', 'cute', 'here', 'sell', 'kiddies', 'cuddly', 'lunch', 'boxes', 'promote', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'adults', 'also', 'still', 'think', 'animation', 'somehow', 'sub-par', 'film', 'making', 'will', 'pass', ""n't"", 'been', 'advertised', 'much', 'Western', 'so', 'fans', 'are', 'likely', 'miss', 'out', 'only', 'rabid', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'fans', 'connoisseurs', 'great', 'shame', 'Rango', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'aimed', 'far', 'more', 'adult', 'Western', 'fans', 'audience', 'child/teen', 'best', 'bits', 'go', 'completely', 'heads', 'younger', 'audience', 'whole', 'Western', 'pastiche', 'will', 'be', 'unfamiliar', 'many', 'extreme', 'frame', 'filling', 'close', 'ups', 'dirty', 'saloons', 'fast', 'talking', 'mariachi', 'music', 'swearing', 'death', ""'Spirit"", 'West', 'left', 'nearly', 'adults', 'theatre', 'spitting', 'popcorn', 'ad', 'laughing', 'earlier', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'skit', 'cracked', 'up', 'significant', 'proportion', 'adult', 'audience', 'leaving', 'kids', 'scratching', 'heads', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'steals', 'scene', 'turning', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'scary', 'will', 'give', 'children', 'scary', 'Rattlesnake', 'Jake', 'Go', 'hell', 'Where', ""d'you"", 'think', 'i', 'come', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'considerable', 'menace', 'mayor', 'even', 'overall', 'characterisation', 'design', 'errs', 'more', 'side', 'harsh', 'reality', 'fluffy', 'fancyisms.The', 'overarching', 'theme', 'town', 'animals', 'Nevada', 'desert', 'bled', 'dry', 'water', 'march', ""'progress"", 'will', 'also', 'pass', 'many', 'may', 'also', 'plant', 'few', 'seeds', 'film', 'have', 'plenty', 'satisfy', 'older', 'children', 'too', 'once', 'bits', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'shoe-horned', 'adult', 'movie', 'rather', 'vice', 'versa', 'such', 'Rango', 'falls', 'two', 'stools', 'being', 'dramatic', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'be', 'genuine', 'adult', 'pastiche', 'foolishly', 'funny', 'endearing', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'children', 'However', 'good', 'bits', 'are', 'genius', 'bad', 'bits', 'merely', ""'just"", 'entertaining', 'Rango', 'real', '5-star', 'appeal']",N/A

1372452,A1OMRVPEES7VO,B003Y5H53S,"Shane Lindsay ""Author of The Raiders of Casti...","[3, 8]","Rango is a brilliantly designed film. It's a western, starring desert animals that look every inch the part. It is a triumph of character design, drawing on a vastly underutilized subset of the animal kingdom. The casting is note perfect. Toads, possums, lizards, tortoises, and the deadliest rattlesnake gunslinger this side of the Rio Grande. Desert animals tend to be scaly, bumpy, and scruffy, and they seem so at home in the mining colony of Dirt, it makes other talking creature movies look like they were designed by plush animal companies. The irony is that if they ever made toy action figures of those mariachi owls, I would buy mine in a heart beat.The story is rather simple. It's the same plot from A Bug's Life, which is the same plot as The Brave Little Tailor. A newcomer (recently escaped lizard Rango) is mistaken for a hero to help solve the town's big problem. in this case, it's a lack of water. Had the movie simply stuck with this tried and true narrative, it could have become one of the all time greats.Instead, the filmmakers seemed determined to load it down with weird quirky bits that look like they belong in a Wes Anderson film. Rango's lizard love interest has a brain glitch that causes her to space out for minutes on end. There's a bizarre homage to Eastwood's Man With No Name, who drives around in a golf cart. The townsfolk line up to perform a strange rain dance every Wednesday. Rango himself spends the first several minutes of the movie putting on an odd one-man show before his aquarium is tossed out the window. These episodes add nothing to film, and only serve to jar us out of the expertly realized Wild West.The bits that work best are based on those time-honored motifs. Rango leading his posse out into desert in search of bank robbers. A runaway wagon chase, with a hundred bats in pursuit. Facing down that slimy rattlesnake at high noon. Too bad that storytellers want to keep busting up these scenes with walking cactus spirits and mystic roadkill. Rango is definitely a beautiful film to watch.

1372458,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B003Y5H53S,Stephen M. Lerch,"[5, 7]","Rango is a Western that has a chameleon in the premier spot; he's the star of the show. Rango comes from humble beginnings (falls out of his family's car while traveling) and is thrown headlong into a role as a sheriff for a desert town trying to figure out where the water they once got every Wednesday, seems to have dried up.Predictable is one way to describe this. It's also sold as a children's movie, having Nickelodeon's name attached, but with all the ""hell's"" being tossed around, I don't know how many parents would want their younger children to view this.Over all it was an OK movie, at best. The film gets 2-3 stars, tops. The Blu Ray gets 5 stars for its presentation.This disc is region free, so you can enjoy it anywhere in the world if purchased through Amazon USA.Video-Encoded in AVC, this HD video will probably be a movie worthy of showcasing just what your shiny new HD TV is capable of. The colors are spot on, there are no video anomalies. Bit rate is high. The movie was done in 2.35:1 ratio, so on your 16x9 HD TV you will still have black borders on the top and bottom of the image.The video quality is ""jaw hit the floor"" amazing. 5 stars for video.Audio-DTS-HD MA (for those that don't know the lingo, this is super high quality). Despite it being a multichannel, 5.1 mix, most of the sound will be driven by your front sound stage and mostly the center channel as the show really is dialog driven.You also get Spanish, Portuguese, and French 5.1 audio. I only did a light sampling of these audio tracks given I don't understand a lick of any of the language. The only thing that seems to change is the language; none of the music or effects change, which is as it should be.5 stars for audioExtras-Audio commentary (self explanatory), Real Creatures of Dirt (live action dip into the real life inspirations for the creatures of Dirt, the town in the film) and deleted scenes. If you watch the extended version of the film, all 10 of the deleted scenes will be shown during the film, so this extra may not seem like an ""extra"" to some.4 stars for the extras. There isn't a lot there, but what is there is nice.Packaging-Rango comes with an embossed cardboard slip cover that covers the standard Blu Ray case. It looks nice. 4 stars as it is nothing amazing.Also of note is the extra DVD. This DVD is ONLY the theatrical version of the film; it does NOT contain the extended edition that restores the cut scenes to the film or the extras. There is also a digital version of the film included for those who wish to transfer to their iPod/iPhone/whatever. This is also the theatrical, non-extended version of the film.Over all, what you get from Rango will depend. If you get all the visual jabs (or nods) at other films, such as Star Wars, Fear and Loathing, etc, you'll enjoy the film immensely. If you're a child, you're likely to feel this movie is potentially boring and has some ""bad"" language.

1372459,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B003Y5H53S,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[13, 19]","I had high expectations after seeing this in theaters and knowing ILM material is made ideally for a format like Blu Ray, and without hesitation this is the best animated Blu I have seen since HD started.I am skipping the (for a better word) animated discussions about all of the hate and discontent towards this film, instead this is merely a product review. The picture and sound are flawless - as perfect as I have heard or seen on a film like this. Every frame is virtually a reference point for a multitude of factors, and the sound uses EVERY channel repeatedly; this is by far the movie to show off your home theater to friends with. The supplements are full of information and can be a worthy time investment (be sure to check the last one for the kids):* Extended version, 4 minutes longer. After watching both versions several times to try and catch the little differences, I painfully became aware I could have watched the deleted scenes to get the answer of what was changed (grrrr). All of the removals are even raunchier adult-themed jokes and material (the Tony Bennett one was funny though). The majority of the added-in footage is the last 3 minutes of the film - essentially an alternate adult ending.* Commentary by the minds behind the film (extended version only). I preferred the documentary with these guys in it as there were too many participants for this commentary.* Deleted scenes, 8:27 minutes in HD. All of these are actually what makes the extended version (them adding the footage on each beginning/start of the scenes is what makes this longer).* Storyboard PiP reel, rated version. Once again I liked the documentaries over watching this but it does contain some great artwork.* Behind the scenes, 2 docus totaling 48:52 minutes. These show the whole pre-production process, from the brainstorming sit-downs to the ""dramaturgical"" events leading up to this film being created. Lists the westerns here that inspired this film (High Noon (Collector's Edition),Will Penny,True Grit (Special Collector's Edition)). Always nice to watch the ILM crew do their art here.* Real creatures of Dirt, 22:10 minutes. Follows one of those Animal Planet insane guys as he tracks down the critters in the desert and does crazy things while talking about them (""this is the most deadly animal in the desert - here let me pick him up while he strikes at me""). Fun for kids.* Field trip to Dirt, takes a couple hours. This life-like program allows you to advance your way through the town. You pick which direction you want to go and into what building. Inside each area are character descriptions and artwork. This was a great time killer in the store as kids tracked their way through all parts of the town - no cheap animation here either, best supplement I have seen for graphics and interest level for the kids.* Disc 2 - bare bones DVD.The movie does cause some parents to get all ruffled while I play it in the store, but I love the adult themes of this movie and obviously the picture sells itself and the sound gives your home theater a good workout. Hope you take the time to avoid all of the negative feedback out there, see that these guys were trying to make a film catered towards older kids and adults - and maybe you might get a fun viewing out of it.",5,"Amazing Blu, a beautiful film, worthy product to own",1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,3282,"['had', 'high', 'expectations', 'seeing', 'theaters', 'knowing', 'ILM', 'material', 'made', 'ideally', 'format', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'hesitation', 'best', 'animated', 'Blu', 'have', 'seen', 'HD', 'started.I', 'am', 'skipping', 'better', 'word', 'animated', 'discussions', 'hate', 'discontent', 'towards', 'film', 'instead', 'merely', 'product', 'review', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'flawless', 'as', 'perfect', 'have', 'heard', 'seen', 'film', 'frame', 'virtually', 'reference', 'point', 'multitude', 'factors', 'sound', 'EVERY', 'channel', 'repeatedly', 'far', 'movie', 'show', 'off', 'home', 'theater', 'friends', 'supplements', 'are', 'full', 'information', 'can', 'be', 'worthy', 'time', 'investment', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'last', 'one', 'kids', '*', 'Extended', 'version', '4', 'minutes', 'longer', 'watching', 'versions', 'several', 'times', 'try', 'catch', 'little', 'differences', 'painfully', 'became', 'aware', 'could', 'have', 'watched', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'get', 'answer', 'what', 'was', 'changed', 'grrrr', 'removals', 'are', 'even', 'raunchier', 'adult-themed', 'jokes', 'material', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'one', 'was', 'funny', 'majority', 'added-in', 'footage', 'last', '3', 'minutes', 'film', 'essentially', 'alternate', 'adult', 'ending', '*', 'Commentary', 'minds', 'film', 'extended', 'version', 'only', 'preferred', 'documentary', 'guys', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'participants', 'commentary', '*', 'Deleted', 'scenes', '8:27', 'minutes', 'HD', 'are', 'actually', 'what', 'extended', 'version', 'adding', 'footage', 'beginning/start', 'scenes', 'what', 'longer', '*', 'Storyboard', 'PiP', 'reel', 'rated', 'version', 'Once', 'again', 'liked', 'documentaries', 'watching', 'contain', 'great', 'artwork', 'scenes', '2', 'docus', 'totaling', '48:52', 'minutes', 'show', 'whole', 'pre-production', 'process', 'brainstorming', 'sit-downs', 'dramaturgical', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'film', 'being', 'created', 'westerns', 'here', 'inspired', 'film', 'High', 'Noon', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Will', 'Penny', 'True', 'Grit', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'nice', 'watch', 'ILM', 'crew', 'do', 'art', 'here', '*', 'Real', 'creatures', 'Dirt', '22:10', 'minutes', 'Follows', 'one', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'insane', 'guys', 'down', 'critters', 'desert', 'crazy', 'things', 'talking', 'most', 'deadly', 'animal', 'desert', 'here', 'let', 'pick', 'up', 'Fun', 'kids', '*', 'Field', 'trip', 'Dirt', 'couple', 'hours', 'life-like', 'program', 'advance', 'way', 'town', 'pick', 'direction', 'want', 'go', 'what', 'building', 'area', 'are', 'character', 'descriptions', 'artwork', 'was', 'great', 'time', 'killer', 'store', 'kids', 'tracked', 'way', 'parts', 'town', 'cheap', 'animation', 'here', 'either', 'best', 'supplement', 'have', 'seen', 'graphics', 'interest', 'level', 'kids', '*', 'Disc', '2', 'bare', 'DVD.The', 'movie', 'cause', 'parents', 'get', 'ruffled', 'play', 'store', 'love', 'adult', 'themes', 'movie', 'obviously', 'picture', 'sound', 'home', 'theater', 'good', 'workout', 'Hope', 'take', 'time', 'avoid', 'negative', 'feedback', 'there', 'see', 'guys', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'catered', 'towards', 'older', 'kids', 'adults', 'maybe', 'might', 'get', 'fun', 'viewing']",N/A
1372460,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B003Y5H53S,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 3]","Rango (animation, comedy, adventure)Directed by Gore VerbinskiStarring the voices of Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher, Bill Nighy and Ned BeattyParamount Pictures | 2011 | 112 min | Rated PG | Released Jul 15, 2011Video:Video codec: MPEG-4 AVCVideo resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 2.40:1Audio:English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1French: Dolby Digital 5.1Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles:English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, SpanishDiscs:50GB Blu-ray DiscDVD copy (with digital copy)The Film 4/5The Blu-ray includes the 107-minute theatrical version and a 112-minute extended version.Rango (Depp) is an aquatic chameleon who is trying to discover his purpose in life. He lives alone in a tank until the car it is being transported in hits a bump and gives him his freedom in the desert. His journey begins when he discovers an armadillo and is told to visit the nearby town of Dirt if he wants to find water. He's given a ride by Beans (Fisher), who owns land in the valley and drops him off in town.Rango begins the movie as a liar who is unsure of his capabilities, until dumb luck elevates him in the eyes of the locals and he starts to believe in himself. He represents hope as the townspeople struggle to find the water they need to survive.The first part of the story is not particularly encouraging. It moves at a frantic pace and initially relies on characters being hurt, and belch or fart jokes for comic relief. But things eventually settle down and the story starts to work. It references many movies from the Western genre, including True Grit and High Noon. Some scenes pay tribute to other movies such as Star Wars.The story is simple, but the setting and design of the characters is extremely detailed. There's also a wealth of voice talent in the supporting cast, including Ray Winstone, Harry Dean Stanton, Abigail Breslin and Timothy Olyphant, as well as the main cast.The dialogue isn't typical and a lot of it won't be easily understood by children. The characters mention chromosome pools, paradigm shifts and aquifers. Rango, in particular, is very articulate. It's quite refreshing to see this kind of thing in an animated movie. Maybe some of the kids will ask their parents to explain terms they don't understand. Even though some of the dialogue is complex, the story is easy to follow.The movie is a mix of fast-paced action, dumb jokes, clever jokes, battle scenes and quiet moments in which Rango contemplates his existence. There are problems to be solved, misunderstandings and traditional themes of good versus evil. One of my favorite elements is the use of a mariachi band, composed of four owls, documenting Rango's tale through the use of various songs.I won't reveal any more of the plot, but I found Rango to be an enjoyable ride. The first 30 minutes had me worried because of the pacing and the dumb jokes, but things improve significantly in the last hour. I often have problems adjusting to the style of North American animation after seeing one of Hayao Miyazaki's films, and I viewed Spirited Away a few days ago. Once I accepted that Rango was a totally different style; I started to enjoy it more.  It's not perfect, but it's well worth your time.Video Quality 5/5If you've ever seen a Pixar movie on Blu-ray, you'll have an idea what to expect from Rango. I couldn't detect a single fault. Colors are striking and detail is exceptional. All of the backgrounds seem properly finished and add depth to the image. When you see Rango's face at the start of the movie, it looks like he's in the room with you. Clothing, skin, scenery and water are all displayed perfectly. This is a presentation that shows off the Blu-ray format wonderfully. Nobody will be disappointed with the look of the movie.Audio Quality 5/5The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track doesn't disappoint either. There's a lot going on throughout the movie and the lossless audio handles everything well. Some of the battle scenes are particularly loud, while other scenes rely on music for maximum effect. The rear speakers are used frequently and I didn't detect any faults in the mix. The image will dazzle you, but you'll be happy with the sound too.Special Features 4/5The additional features are all presented in full HD.Audio Commentary (Extended version only) with Director, Gore Verbinski; Head of Story James Ward Byrkit; Production Designer Mark ""Crash"" McCreery; Animation Director Hal Hickel; and Visual Effects Supervisor Tim Alexander.Breaking the Rules: Making Animation History (48:52) - A two-part feature consisting of The Stage is Set and Now we Ride. Learn about how the movie was made and see the evolution of the characters.Deleted Scenes (8:27) - A brief look at 10 additional scenes which will seem very familiar if you watched the extended version of the movie.Real Creatures of Dirt (22:15) - Showing real desert creatures such as snakes, scorpions, tarantulas and armadillos.Storyboard Reel Picture-in-Picture (theatrical version only)A Field Trip to Dirt - An interactive digital model which allows you to ride through the town and look around.Theatrical Trailer (2:27)CreditsPreviewsDVD Copy (digital copy on disc)Rango is a fun way to spend almost two hours. Although some of the dialogue is complex, the movie is suitable for the whole family and has something for everyone. The blend of action and humor works well overall and the animals make interesting and memorable characters. The Blu-ray is just about perfect and Rango immediately ranks among the best presentations the format has to offer.Overall score 4.5/5",4,An entertaining animated Western for the whole

1372466,A2Q8GFSEUSGJ51,B003Y5H53S,S. WIlliams,"[2, 11]","This is a typical hard-boiled Western transposed onto desert wildlife, using some rather impressive computer animation (the textures have a level of realism I have never seen before), and a few big name actors, including a clever cameo/impesonation by the king of the hard-boiled Western. (If you don't know, I don't want to spoil it.)Too talky and complicated for young kids (the MANY old movie references will obviously sail right over their heads; heck I'm in my mid-30s and most of the references are well before my time and likely only to appeal to Western film buffs), and not fleshed out enough for adults, with some nonsensical touches that distracted from the story. Why are all the animals in the town the same size--cats and lizards, for instance--and wearing clothes, when the story is clearly set in the real, human world and animals/people outside Dirt are animated to scale? And why are some animals characters, while others, seemingly of the same class and species, livestock?  On the one hand, the animals relied on converted human objects to build their towns, and then on the other they seemed to have their own industries and imports, for things like lizard-sized wagons and a cactus juice bottling plant. The fantasy-reality mix just didn't seem to fit.As a viewer, if I'm thinking about all this while watching the movie, it's because the story hasn't drawn me in enough to overlook these lapses in logic. Not to mention the fact that the film's climax completely skips how the water was diverted in the first place, and has no resolve to the what-the-mayor-is-buying-up-farms-to-build storyline that dominates the whole rest of the film. (Kind of a big plot hole. Though I guess we're supposed to imagine he's building a Lizard Las Vegas?) And,  yeah, the Wednesday water scene was creepy/weird and totally out of character from the rest of the film. Those were the good old Zombie days (when the spigot turned) the townsfolk wanted to recapture?In an attempt, I'm sure, to appeal to kids, the story is a bit too dumbed down for grown-ups, but still definitely over most kids' heads.

1372491,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B003Y5H53S,V. Berk,"[3, 7]","Rango is a very unique animated film that I honestly don't think I can evaluate by traditional animation standards.  Yes, it is animated (a good first outing for special effect giant Industrial Light And Magic, for whom this is their first fully animated film) and yes, there is lots of slapstick material for the family audience, but the true intended audience of Rango is clearly more seasoned moviegoers.  This is an animated film I think will be most appreciated by those who are familiar with the many films it draws inspiration from. Director Gore Verbinski switches gears from his Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, which had gotten pretty over-the-top by At World's End to deliver a light, enjoyable animated feature.Johnny Depp is the titular ""Rango"" - or, at least, that's who he claims to be.  You see, the chameleon was a family pet with an overactive imagination who dreamed of writing plays and acting out heroic characters, but whose true name the audience is never given (no doubt a nod to the Man with No Name western trilogy starring Clint Eastwood).  When he gets lost due to a freak accident in the Mojave Desert his travels take him to the small animal community of Dirt he quickly forges a false identity under the name ""Rango""- a rough, gun blazing icon who once killed seven men with a single bullet!  By chance he also manages to kill the hawk (which happens to sport a steel tipped beak) which only raises his prestige in the town, resulting in his becoming the new town sheriff.Johnny Depp gives a very enjoyable performance as Rango, but I don't think is as ""likable"" as the script seems to want him to be- or I should say: he isn't likable in the way a ""family movie"" hero should be likable.  He is often cowardly, self-centered, as well as a compulsive liar whose imagination runs rampant.  One scene in particular stands out for Rango's ""unlikable"" factor, when the citizens of Dirt are rioting over the water shortage and Rango (who has been thirsty most of the movie) chooses to drink four cups of water while lecturing the citizens on how they can't all get water or else they'd run out.  Naturally he looks like a perfect ass for this entire segment that can't really be sympathized with by the audience.  This is fun for older audiences who like a more flawed protagonist, but at times the script tries too hard to make him seem like a charming, upstanding role-model, when lots of the time he just comes across as a jerk.Most important to know about before seeing Rango is undoubtedly Sergio Leone's Italian made Westerns (Or ""Spaghetti Westerns"" as we lovingly tend to call them), particularly the ones featuring Clint Eastwood in his break out role as The Man with No Name.  The music, the look, the atmosphere, and the classic western stand-offs are all in loving tribute of Leone's heavily stylized portrayal of the west.  Aside from the pure Leone Western clich&eacute;s and archetypes the primary plot of Rango surprisingly is taken from Roman Polanski's detective mystery Chinatown.  In both the plot revolves around a city (the small desert community of ""Dirt"" replaces L.A.) that is experiencing a severe draught, yet someone is dumping fresh, usable water into the desert, away from the eyes of citizens for some unknown reason.  If you have seen ""Chinatown"", Rango makes no attempt of hiding who the antagonist will turn-out to be, as the villain dresses the same as the villain of Chinatown, and has the EXACT same plan involving water and real-estate, but that isn't really bothersome because Rango puts a lot of heart in its tributes to classic films.  They know that they're using Chinatown's plot and I don't think they try to sell this film's plot as being anything other than an excuse to pay tribute to the classics, so this isn't a problem,The secondary antagonist of the film is the one who's already been revealed via trailers: A leather hat wearing serpent by the name of Rattlesnake Jake.  Coming out with a tough as nails voice and a segmented Gatling gun for a rattle this is honestly perhaps the most awesome villain I've seen in an animated film in years!  He even tells a character that he comes from Hell (oh yeah- this film does take a risk for an animated film of using lots of ""Damns"" and ""Go to Hell!"" type talk that parents wouldn't want repeated by their children).  With all the other sentient animals in this film (it will always bug me why some animals in here are anthromorphic and sentient while others, like the roadrunners, are not...) it is really impressive to see how the folk from Industrial Light And Magic were able to bring credibility to a snake being capable of doing the same things as all the other critters, even with the lack of hands.Jake is voiced amazingly well by British actor Bill Nighy, who, like Depp, previously worked with director Gore Verbinski in the Pirates of the Caribbean films, portraying tentacle-faced ship captain Davy Jones.  He really must have had fun doing this outlaw of a Diamondback Rattlesnake (who is so villainous he even has a little moustache pattern on the scales above his mouth!). I'm serious, this villain is just pure fun to watch.  He is every-single awesome outlaw stereotype wrapped up in a delicious, slivering package!  He has a foot (tail?) in for being a likely pick if I choose to compile a list of my favorite villains for the 2011 movie season.Gore Verbenski and composer Hans Zimmer made it apparent that they had a mutual love of Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone's musical scores.  Once more Zimmer reflects on the themes of ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"" and ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" with extraordinary effectiveness.Rango is not a perfect animated movie, nor do I think young children will appreciate it as much as viewers in their upper teens and older.  It won't traumatize any kids, but it probably is far too intense for them, and the best of the film's humor they'll likely have no hope in understanding due to not being exposed to the countless films referenced- many of which are rated R films from the 1960s-1970s.  There's Chinatown and the Leone Spaghetti Westerns, but other films I saw referenced include: Apocalypse Now, Star Wars, The Wizard of Oz, any given zombie movie, and I'm sure there were many more that have simply slipped my mind.As a standalone film I do think Rango was mighty entertaining for what it was- a loving tribute to the western genre and other classic films.",5,Unique and fitting

Shrek has hell, damn, farts, burps, and all sort of nasty things, i personally love it, but little children would not understand it, or they would immitate it. Rango is a very good film with clever humor geared towards adults, most people who go to see it should read this and then they wouldn't drag kids into a film like this in the first place and waste money. Kids usually laugh at kid jokes, the jokes here, and humor is very dry with a lot of sarcasm. The animation is beautiful, and i for one thought the movie was brilliant. Funny it's one of the highest rated animate films next to Toy Story 3, check out Rotten Tomatoes. And 90 some percent of the fans loved it to. So quit complaining about them saying hell, or damn, it's in the bible and they tell little kids they are going to hell all the time at church. Or will be damned in hellish torment. Even on sitcoms geared for kids they swear. So what. Don't like it, don't watch it, stick the kids to kid based films. I personally thought this was awesome, and will definitely get it on blu ray, looks amazing. Story isn't great but fun. The whole move is just that, fun! And Johnny Depp does excellent voice over work that you can't even tell it's him.

1372496,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B003Y5H53S,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[103, 132]","Gore Verbinski's animated feature Rango, with voices by Johnny Depp, Ned Beatty and a host of other talented actors, is a hard film to review, mainly because its real target audience is not the one it's being marketed towards. Let me just flat out say it:  this really isn't a kids' animated movie.  Not because there's anything in it that is not suitable for kids - there isn't - but because 95 percent of what really makes it worth seeing is going to go right over most kids' heads.On the surface, the plot is fairly straightforward, at least in the set-up. A terrarium-housed pet chameleon lizard (it's significant after the fact that you never know his real name) ends up stranded in the desert where he is directed to a small town that is on the verge of extinction because of a mysterious water shortage. In his efforts to blend in (he _is_ a chamelon after all), he adopts the name Rango and in quick order suddenly finds himself appointed sheriff and given the mission of finding out what's happened to the town's water.Stylistically, Verbinski was willing to take some real chances with Rango, and anyone who appreciates animation as an art will find a lot to see here. The level of detail and sheer originality is stunning. Rango does not resemble _anything_ I've seen in an animated film before. Though set in the current day, the world of Rango is essentially an Old West town - aptly named Dirt - that's literally drying up, populated by a cast of animal characters who look like they stepped out of any number of classic Westerns. The difference between Rango and your usual animated take on this theme though is that the residents of Dirt are _not_ cute.  In addition to being much closer in look to the real animals they're based on - lizards, tortoises, toads, possums, snakes, prarie dogs and such - they're also grizzled, dusty, sun-bleached and wind-beaten, and in many cases, just downright _ugly_.  Including, or even especially, the good guys.  One suspects that merchandising for Rango will be somewhat problematic.But it says something that everything fits together seamlessly.  The town really looks like an Old West town on the verge of becoming a ghost town, and the characters look like they really do live there.  And again, the level of detail is stunning, from the clothes the characters wear to the characters themselves, the buildings and other structures, the interiors. The four desert-owl mariachi players who sing narration at various points in the film are a case in point.  The level of detail that is taken with their intricately shaded feathers, their embroidered mariachi costumes and their musical instruments - and the way all of these things _move_ when the characters do - is amazing.  This is a movie you could watch again and again just to appreciate how much the artists put into it.I have to mention two characters in particular that really stood out:  the Mayor (marvelously voiced by Ned Beatty), a tortoise modeled directly on John Huston's genial but chilling Noah Cross from the classic film Chinatown, and Rattlesnake Jake (also marvelously voiced by Bill Nighy), absolutely one of the best animated villains ever created.  It's absolutely spell-binding just to watch Jake _move_, a stunning feat of animation. I've never seen an animated character manage to radiate sheer menace on the level that Rattlesnake Jake does.  In thinking about it, I now have to amend my earlier statement somewhat; Rattlesnake Jake could definitely scare some younger children.  But that said, Rango is worth seeing for Rattlesnake Jake alone.My mention of Chinatown brings me to the other prospective audience for Rango:  film buffs. Rango references a truly astonishing number of movies: several classic Westerns (High Noon; The Good, the Bad & the Ugly; The Quick & The Dead, Paint Your Wagon) as one would expect, but also a number of non-Westerns, some fairly recent (Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, A Bug's Life), some classic (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now) and some obscure (Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas). And of course Chinatown, not only for the Mayor character but for a number of scenes (watch for the glasses) and a good deal of the plot. And there's also a key scene that's a nod to a famous actor/director who is still remembered for his association with Westerns and for a certain classic character he created. A good example of the little in-jokes in Rango is what he's carrying around in the back of the golf cart. As I said, most kids are going to miss 95 percent of this stuff. Me, I want to get the DVD just so I can watch it again and pick out all of the references I probably missed the first time around.  It's that kind of movie.About my only real criticism of Rango - other than its being marketed to the wrong audience - is that parts of it are uneven and do tend to drag a bit. I think this is because the parts that do seem to be meant for kids tend not to mesh that well with the rest of the film. The parts that adults will enjoy most will probably be of little interest to kids, and the parts that kids will enjoy most will probably make things drag for adults.But overall, I highly recommend Rango.  It's not your typical animated film, and most kids will probably complain that a lot of it's boring, but for anyone who loves the sheer art of animation or who just loves films that reference all manner of movies from the great to the obscure, this is definitely a film you'll want to see.",4,"Great animation, but really more for film buffs and lovers of animation than for kids",1299628800,"03

But ""Rango"" turned out to be a downright terrific one. It's the kind of animated film Pixar pioneered (joke intended), but seems to have forgotten how to make.""Rango"" is a delight from beginning to end. One clever, charming, or witty moment is quickly followed by another. The tone is strictly adult -- not unlike ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"". It's not a film aimed at children -- kids won't appreciate it. And -- partly because it's contemporary -- it never lapses into arch self-awareness. John Logan's literate script is a pleasure. (Note that Johnny Guitar's real name is Johnny Logan. Odd coincidence.)The character design and animation are superb -- the best I've seen in any CGI film.

First, the animation itself - that just keeps getting better as the CGI guys perfect their craft, and this rides the wave. Hair, feathers, and all kinds of delicate effects come across beautifully, in ways that couldn't have been done just a few years ago. But, even the best tools do nothing without an artist to wield them, and the characters here show real artistry. Each one has a unique look, from the cute ""Little Sister"" to the grizzled characters of the Western genre, to the dusty Mayor with his windup wheelchair.Taking it a step further, good looks and shallow characters leave a movie feeling oddly hollow, but these characters all come to life. Depp's mouthy lizard with the aloha shirt stars, of course, but each personality stands on its own. Then the scripting takes those individuals, and puts them to work in a demanding set of roles: the kind that stay true to the oater genre while satirizing it at every step. The sendup of the spaghetti western wouldn't have come across nearly as well if it weren't taken seriously, too. (The Clint Eastwood-like cameo was a high point.)Although the movie had plenty of kid appeal, there was plenty to keep the grownups entertained as well. In fact, a few jokes (like ""side saddle"") had me rolling, at the same time I was glad I didn't have a kid demanding an explanation.
