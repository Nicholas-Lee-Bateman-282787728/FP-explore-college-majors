Since other peoples reviews stated that their copies had defects.Well I DIDN'T and THANK GOD!!!That aside, the story of Gundam SEED beginning is both a little too simple and a little slow/fast(depends on the situations). This made me wonder if it was worth it. I've heard that this won two awards and was better receieved than Gundam Wing in Japan. Another thing I should mention is that this is my first Gundam I have ever seen and, no, I didn't see the edited version on Cartoon Network. Granted, the show would've felt lacking edited(as most edits do). MY point is that thepacing of the show made me wonder if it was going to live up to it's hype.The later episodes were a bit better, and around 18 was when I was COMPLETELY convinced that this was a great series. The main characters Kira and Athrun are very unique people, and the roles they play impress me of their morale.The sub characters like Lacus, Flay, were also unique but in ways you would see in common US television shows. It helps us understand what they mean with material we see most of the time. Flay is a little creepy... but her character is very warped, yet their never a sense of overkill, like most animes get. Anime is usually known for it's over-the-top behavior, but this series is very down to earth, that to me signaled the first glimmer of it's beauty.Now when it comes to languages I don't complain, but the only cases where I MIGHT consider it is when Lacus sings, and to just know what the other sounds like. I personally like the english dub since it fits most of the characters.The story has very cool, touching, shocking, and just plain WOW parts that took me aback and in the end I felt that it was necessary. I say after 13 is when eratic, biziare stuff happens.Gundam SEED is, to me, a different approach to anime, but since the theme is war, I don't complain.",5,NO PROBLEMS; a tight and simply moving series.,1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,1928,"['Too', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'debating', 'not', 'should', 'should', ""n't"", 'buy', 'other', 'peoples', 'reviews', 'stated', 'copies', 'had', 'defects.Well', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'THANK', 'GOD', 'aside', 'story', 'Gundam', 'SEED', 'beginning', 'little', 'too', 'simple', 'little', 'slow/fast', 'situations', 'made', 'wonder', 'was', 'worth', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'won', 'two', 'awards', 'was', 'better', 'receieved', 'Gundam', 'Wing', 'Japan', 'thing', 'should', 'mention', 'first', 'Gundam', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'edited', 'version', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Granted', 'show', 'would', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'lacking', 'edited', 'most', 'edits', 'do', 'point', 'thepacing', 'show', 'made', 'wonder', 'was', 'going', 'live', 'up', 'hype.The', 'later', 'episodes', 'were', 'bit', 'better', '18', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'COMPLETELY', 'convinced', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'main', 'characters', 'Kira', 'Athrun', 'are', 'very', 'unique', 'people', 'roles', 'play', 'impress', 'morale.The', 'sub', 'characters', 'Lacus', 'Flay', 'were', 'also', 'unique', 'ways', 'would', 'see', 'common', 'US', 'television', 'shows', 'understand', 'what', 'mean', 'material', 'see', 'most', 'time', 'Flay', 'little', 'creepy', 'character', 'very', 'warped', 'never', 'sense', 'overkill', 'most', 'animes', 'get', 'Anime', 'usually', 'known', 'over-the-top', 'behavior', 'series', 'very', 'down', 'earth', 'signaled', 'first', 'glimmer', 'beauty.Now', 'when', 'languages', 'do', ""n't"", 'complain', 'only', 'cases', 'where', 'MIGHT', 'consider', 'when', 'Lacus', 'sings', 'just', 'know', 'what', 'other', 'sounds', 'personally', 'english', 'dub', 'most', 'characters.The', 'story', 'very', 'cool', 'touching', 'shocking', 'just', 'plain', 'WOW', 'parts', 'took', 'aback', 'end', 'felt', 'was', 'necessary', 'say', '13', 'when', 'eratic', 'biziare', 'stuff', 'happens.Gundam', 'SEED', 'different', 'approach', 'anime', 'theme', 'war', 'do', ""n't"", 'complain']",N/A
1119873,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B000YGP6RC,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","I know many others have complained about playback issues on this particular set. I have watched all five discs and have had no issues. I also purchased the set as an amazon pre-order and received it right after the release date (thanks to Prime membership).For anyone not familiar with the GUNDAM series, this makes a great intro. Each series (with the exception of Destiny) begins with a new cast and a new backstory. In this particular series, a young boy is forced to pilot a mobile suit against his wishes....sounds a bit like every other anime, but don't zone out yet!What sets GUNDAM Seed Destiny apart from other boy robot anime is the flawless characterization as well as the BEST Japanese voice acting I have ever encountered. DO NOT WATCH IN ENGLISH! The English dub is very emotionless and, well, boring.That said, the characters are beautifully drawn and their personalities are very realistic. Kira is not anything like the disgustingly inept Shinji from Eva, though he has his emotional breakdowns, he is very unselfish and vows to protect his friends, even against his people.The story is very engaging as well. Genetically enhanced humans are called 'Coordinators' and live (for the most part) apart from the non-engineered humans called 'Naturals'. The world is at war with Zaft representing the coordinators and the Atlantic Force representing the naturals. Though Kira is a coordinator (trust me not a spoiler) he is thrust into battle against Zaft and his fellow coordinators in order to protect his schoolmates.This is an action packed anime with beautiful animation. The music is also top notch. This shows what can be done from a top studio (Sunrise) when they have a limitless budget to work with.And of course it is one of the best selling anime series in Japan.",5,No disc problems - great series ~,1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,1787,"['know', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'complained', 'playback', 'issues', 'particular', 'set', 'have', 'watched', 'five', 'discs', 'have', 'had', 'issues', 'also', 'purchased', 'set', 'amazon', 'pre-order', 'received', 'right', 'release', 'date', 'thanks', 'Prime', 'membership', '.For', 'anyone', 'not', 'familiar', 'GUNDAM', 'series', 'great', 'intro', 'series', 'exception', 'Destiny', 'new', 'cast', 'new', 'backstory', 'particular', 'series', 'young', 'boy', 'forced', 'pilot', 'mobile', 'suit', 'wishes', 'bit', 'other', 'anime', 'do', ""n't"", 'zone', 'out', 'yet', 'What', 'GUNDAM', 'Seed', 'Destiny', 'apart', 'other', 'boy', 'robot', 'anime', 'flawless', 'characterization', 'as', 'well', 'BEST', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'have', 'ever', 'encountered', 'DO', 'NOT', 'WATCH', 'IN', 'ENGLISH', 'English', 'dub', 'very', 'emotionless', 'well', 'said', 'characters', 'are', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'personalities', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'Kira', 'not', 'anything', 'disgustingly', 'inept', 'Shinji', 'Eva', 'emotional', 'breakdowns', 'very', 'unselfish', 'vows', 'protect', 'friends', 'even', 'people.The', 'story', 'very', 'engaging', 'as', 'well', 'Genetically', 'enhanced', 'humans', 'are', 'called', ""'Coordinators"", 'live', 'most', 'part', 'apart', 'non-engineered', 'humans', 'called', ""'Naturals"", 'world', 'war', 'Zaft', 'representing', 'coordinators', 'Atlantic', 'Force', 'representing', 'naturals', 'Kira', 'coordinator', 'trust', 'not', 'spoiler', 'thrust', 'battle', 'Zaft', 'fellow', 'coordinators', 'order', 'protect', 'schoolmates.This', 'action', 'packed', 'anime', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'music', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'top', 'studio', 'Sunrise', 'when', 'have', 'limitless', 'budget', 'work', 'with.And', 'course', 'one', 'best', 'selling', 'anime', 'series', 'Japan']",N/A
1119874,A1KALWSKK12C18,B000YGP6RC,"Iron Giant ""Iron Giant""","[1, 8]","First off, Disk 2 was damaged and unreadable, but I choose not to allow that to affect the review.  I emailed the manufacturer who had a replacement to me within a couple days so thats worth overlooking the issue imo.Secondly, maybe I am dense, but this is not a ""complete"" product despite the words ""Complete Collection"" on the cover.  It is the first in an installment of 2 DVD collections.  As I was watching the final epidode in this series, they had a trailer for the next episode, which irked me but at least I didn't feel like they cut it in half on ""purpose"".  There is quite a bit of material in here so they decided to make some extra money and release it in 2 sets.  In fact they should have made it one long series and charged 50% more but I'm going to be somewhat generous and overlook that too in the review rating.What I can't overlook though is this: The Gundam series has exactly one story which they tell again and again, changing a couple of names and nothing else.I have seen 3 Gundam series now and here is the story:A teenage boy, with no military training finds himself in the middle of a battle in his home ""town"" (space station, whatever).He is a peaceful young man, who doesn't ""believe"" in war.He comes across a prototype war machine designed to turn the tide of the war.The military commanders decide that, rather than have the machine piloted by an experience war veteran, it would be best if the 17 year old boy with no military training whatsoever pilot the trillion dollar war machine.  He also exceeds everyones expectations and instantly becomes the best warrior anyone has ever seen.The experimental and expensive war machine is taken on board an experimental warship and they spend the rest of the show being chased by the enemy in a long running battle where they are free to discuss and see the horrors of war.This makes 3 series now, with that exact same plot line and its getting a bit tiring.The good news is, of the 3 I've seen, this is the most ""grownup"" of them.  The characters are slightly better fleshed out, and more adult conversations are had.  One girl uses sex as a ""weapon"" in one plot line and teenage petulance is not as overlooked as in other Gundam series.  This isn't to say this is aimed at an adult audience however.  The constant use of a ""teenage boy in grandiose situations"" has been beat to death.  Doesn't the entire nation of Japanese Anime writers have anything else?  The Japanese Anime community deserves better.  It is a sloppy and lazy way to engage who is clearly their primary target: teenage boys.  Teenage boys (and girls for that matter) deserve more credit than that.  A good story will engage everyone.There are a couple panty shots but none of the more hard stuff typical from Japan.  However, at the beginning of the show during the music is a siloutte of a nude woman arching her back with her breasts heaving.  Maybe not for the younger crowd, which is a shame because other than that and 2 panty shots, even younger teens could have enjoyed this show (the woman who uses sex as a weapon is not rewarded for it and it can even be seen as a warning about the dangers of teenage sexual activity...).  On the other hand, any teenage boy with even indirect access to the Internet has seen a whole lot worse than this...The combat is better than average and includes some large fleet engagements as well, but this particular Gundam takes the ""large robot"" fantasy a little to far for me.  3 prototype Gundams slaughter an entire fleet of capital ships as well as dozens of their support fighters WITHOUT A SCRATCH.  Only the enemy Gundam is capable of stopping them.  This too is a bit much to swallow and should have been toned down.  Large and powerful, sure.  Completely unstoppable, no.Making the Gundams totally overwhelming just pulled me away from the action and reminded me of the silly dribble I watched from Japan as a boy where every robot was Godzilla and every piece of military machinary was just a prop for the guy in the suit to stomp on.In the end, if I were going to recommend someones first Gundam series, this would be it.  But then there would be nowhere else to go after this...",3,"Been there, done that, but this time was ok",1234396800,"02 12, 2009",2009,4177,"['First', 'off', 'Disk', '2', 'was', 'damaged', 'unreadable', 'choose', 'not', 'allow', 'affect', 'review', 'emailed', 'manufacturer', 'who', 'had', 'replacement', 'couple', 'days', 'so', 'thats', 'worth', 'overlooking', 'issue', 'imo.Secondly', 'maybe', 'am', 'dense', 'not', 'complete', 'product', 'words', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'cover', 'first', 'installment', '2', 'DVD', 'collections', 'was', 'watching', 'final', 'epidode', 'series', 'had', 'trailer', 'next', 'episode', 'irked', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cut', 'half', 'purpose', 'quite', 'bit', 'material', 'here', 'decided', 'make', 'extra', 'money', 'release', '2', 'sets', 'fact', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'long', 'series', 'charged', '50', '%', 'more', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'somewhat', 'generous', 'overlook', 'too', 'review', 'rating.What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'though', 'Gundam', 'series', 'exactly', 'one', 'story', 'tell', 'again', 'again', 'changing', 'couple', 'names', 'nothing', 'else.I', 'have', 'seen', '3', 'Gundam', 'series', 'now', 'here', 'story', 'teenage', 'boy', 'military', 'training', 'middle', 'battle', 'home', 'town', 'space', 'station', '.He', 'peaceful', 'young', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'war.He', 'prototype', 'war', 'machine', 'designed', 'turn', 'tide', 'war.The', 'military', 'commanders', 'decide', 'rather', 'have', 'machine', 'piloted', 'experience', 'war', 'veteran', 'would', 'be', 'best', '17', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'military', 'training', 'pilot', 'trillion', 'dollar', 'war', 'machine', 'also', 'everyones', 'expectations', 'instantly', 'best', 'warrior', 'anyone', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'experimental', 'expensive', 'war', 'machine', 'taken', 'board', 'experimental', 'warship', 'spend', 'rest', 'show', 'being', 'chased', 'enemy', 'long', 'running', 'battle', 'where', 'are', 'free', 'discuss', 'see', 'horrors', 'war.This', '3', 'series', 'now', 'exact', 'same', 'plot', 'line', 'getting', 'bit', 'tiring.The', 'good', 'news', '3', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'grownup', 'characters', 'are', 'slightly', 'better', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more', 'adult', 'conversations', 'are', 'had', 'One', 'girl', 'sex', 'weapon', 'one', 'plot', 'line', 'teenage', 'petulance', 'not', 'as', 'overlooked', 'other', 'Gundam', 'series', ""n't"", 'say', 'aimed', 'adult', 'audience', 'however', 'constant', 'use', 'teenage', 'boy', 'grandiose', 'situations', 'been', 'beat', 'death', ""n't"", 'entire', 'nation', 'Japanese', 'Anime', 'writers', 'have', 'anything', 'else', 'Japanese', 'Anime', 'community', 'better', 'sloppy', 'lazy', 'way', 'engage', 'who', 'clearly', 'primary', 'target', 'teenage', 'boys', 'Teenage', 'boys', 'girls', 'matter', 'more', 'credit', 'good', 'story', 'will', 'engage', 'everyone.There', 'are', 'couple', 'panty', 'shots', 'none', 'more', 'hard', 'stuff', 'typical', 'Japan', 'However', 'beginning', 'show', 'music', 'siloutte', 'nude', 'woman', 'arching', 'back', 'breasts', 'heaving', 'Maybe', 'not', 'younger', 'crowd', 'shame', 'other', '2', 'panty', 'shots', 'even', 'younger', 'teens', 'could', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'woman', 'who', 'sex', 'weapon', 'not', 'rewarded', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'seen', 'warning', 'dangers', 'teenage', 'sexual', 'activity', 'other', 'hand', 'teenage', 'boy', 'even', 'indirect', 'access', 'Internet', 'seen', 'whole', 'lot', 'worse', 'combat', 'better', 'average', 'large', 'fleet', 'engagements', 'well', 'particular', 'Gundam', 'large', 'robot', 'little', 'far', '3', 'prototype', 'Gundams', 'slaughter', 'entire', 'fleet', 'capital', 'ships', 'as', 'well', 'dozens', 'support', 'fighters', 'WITHOUT', 'SCRATCH', 'Only', 'enemy', 'Gundam', 'capable', 'stopping', 'too', 'bit', 'much', 'swallow', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'Large', 'powerful', 'sure', 'Completely', 'unstoppable', 'no.Making', 'Gundams', 'totally', 'overwhelming', 'just', 'pulled', 'away', 'action', 'reminded', 'silly', 'dribble', 'watched', 'Japan', 'boy', 'where', 'robot', 'was', 'Godzilla', 'piece', 'military', 'machinary', 'was', 'just', 'prop', 'guy', 'suit', 'stomp', 'end', 'were', 'going', 'recommend', 'someones', 'first', 'Gundam', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go']",N/A

With a lot of the Gundam universe story lines you have two dividing parties and beliefs the COORDINATORS(Basically genetically improved humans) and NATURALS(Normal humans) and the fight between them is basically which path humanity should ultimately take the way of the coordinators or natural evolution.  The characters you also begin to care for is a lot more than the ten or so that I did on Gundam Wing and also unlike GW some of the characters you care for get killed off in some of the episodes.  I don't want to give to much of the story away but I can tell you that about four of the characters in the series die about near the end of the show which for me was real heart-wrenching since you do want to see them get some kind of happy ending.  The animation is clear and sharp and the audio for both the Japanese and English voice actors was great.  Again with a lot of box sets there isn't much in the way of extras just some textless intro/ending songs and some trailers.  I've heard that they're going to start releasing Gundam Seed Destiny in box sets soon but I doubt I'll be getting those because I've seen some episodes and they've already killed a couple of other characters I cared for off.
