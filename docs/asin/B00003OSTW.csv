546089,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00003OSTW,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[5, 5]","'The Shoes of the Fisherman' is a grand, sweeping spectacle of a movie.  It has great scenes that often linger for dramatic importance and provides a story that mirrors events that came to fruition after its inception.  Anthony Quinn plays Kiril Lakota, a Catholic bishop forced into a Soviet labor camp for twenty years. (Startlingly reminiscent of John Paul II). At the beginning the Vatican gets the Kremlin to release him and brings him to Rome, where he will serve as a cardinal.  He's humble and reluctant at first, but when the pope dies, the election for a successor is so protracted that the College of Cardinals starts to vote on Lakota's candidacy; one he is loathe to pursue.  (Also, a close parallel to John Paul II's election.)Brought to the ascension of pope, he must face the communist threat of nuclear annihilation from Chairman Peng of China (Bert Kwouk). The Chinese leader threatens nuclear annihilation unless his people are fed.  (Another close tie to North Korea today!)  He must also face the puzzled, but common, testimony of a suspected heretic, Fr. Telemond (Oskar Werner).  Being humble, he shows the priest affected compassion.  The new pope, not entirely comfortable in his new role, tries to go incognito through Rome.  Poignantly, he helps a dying Jewish man and performs their prayers, which he learned from Jewish dissidents at the communist labor camp.  (Again, this touching scene mirrors John Paul II's overtures to the Jewish community.)  His actions aren't always in step with the college of cardinals--another frightening parallel--but his emphasis on charity and his appeals to the multitudes at St. Peter's square jump the barrier of being a foreign pope.Sometimes the scenes linger too long, which is a mixed blessing.  They could have pared the drama down about twenty minutes or so, but the grandeur is remarkable.  (The cinematography is excellent, and the crowd scenes are believable.)  Sir Laurence Olivier plays a Russian confidante of Lakota's in a fine, understated performance.  In the mix is a sideplot about an American reporter (David Janssen) who struggles with his own Catholic faith, his own infidelities and a wife who seems to put her career before the marriage.  Hardly seeming like a period piece, 'The Shoes of a Fisherman' reflects the present and the movie's own near future in ways that the first audiences wouldn't have dreamed of.  Going through the movie's slow pace is worth the treasure of believable dialogue and an urgent plot demonstrating the perseverence and patience of religious leaders demonstrating a believable execution.

It's a powerful portrayal, and not the type of role one would normally associate with him. Oskar Werner, in a part based on Teilhard de Chardin, is absolutely superb.Other notable performances come from Laurence Olivier (as the Soviet Premier), John Gielgud (former Pope), Leo McKern and Vittorio de Sica (Cardinals), and Arnoldo Foa (the Pope's valet).The part of a journalist (David Janssen), is used as a narrator, to move the plot along, and explain certain Vatican procedures, like how a new Pope is elected.

It has been mentioned that this particular philosophical outlook was probably inspired by Jesuit Priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin - some might call this ""new Age' religion - but the debate presented in this film is truly fascinating, and seems very sincere!Anyway, the main Crisis presented in this film is the possibility of devastating & horrific World War - and how the brand-new Ukrainian Pope (who is also interestingly well-versed in Hebrew, as witnessed in a crucial & moving scene) ==> courageously grapples with and does everything humanly possible to avert potential global devastation - but will it be enough?!Intriguing and even enlightening - and unfortunately still relevant to our Times  ==> who would have ever dreamed that we would still be dealing with such persistent worries in the 21st Century?!",5,Intriguing Story still Relevant to our 21st Century!,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,2327,"['beginning', 'Passover', 'Easter', 'coming', 'soon', 'most', 'unfortunately', 'heating-up', 'tensions', 'eastern', 'hemisphere', 'Russia/Ukraine', '==', '>', 'here', 'very', 'intriguing', 'spiritual/religious', 'themed', 'film', 'odd', 'way', 'still', 'relevant', 'again', 'own', 'time', 'even', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'when', 'Cold', 'War', 'tensions', 'were', 'forefront', 'people', 'worries', 'circa', '1968', '.This', 'quite', 'realistic', 'scenario', 'bishop', 'Kiril', 'Lakota', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'originally', 'Lviv/', 'Lvov', 'Western', 'Ukraine', 'time', 'film', 'release', 'still', 'part', 'USSR', 'who', 'eventually', 'become', 'Pope', 'long-stay', 'Siberian', 'Gulag.But', 'nonetheless', 'due', 'familiarity', 'invaluable', 'knowledge', 'Ukraine/Russia', '=', 'feel', 'strong', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'work', 'towards', 'easing', 'East/West', 'tensions', 'whatever', 'extent', 'humanly', 'possible', 'particular', 'crisis', 'film', 'heavily', 'China', 'verge', 'famine', 'possibly', 'leading', 'World', 'War', '.This', 'ambitious', 'film', 'due', 'fact', 'also', 'show', 'inner', 'workings', 'Vatican', 'also', 'highlights', 'most', 'intriguing', 'philosophical', 'debate', 'dilemma', 'Pope', 'Lakota', 'friend', 'Father', 'Telemond', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Oskar', 'Werner', 'who', 'somewhat', 'outcast', 'believing', 'living', 'God', 'Cosmos', 'i.e', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'exist', 'ancient', 'doctrine', 'can', 'be', 'accessed/reached', 'vital', 'direct', 'connection', 'available', 'Living', 'beings', 'been', 'mentioned', 'particular', 'philosophical', 'outlook', 'was', 'probably', 'inspired', 'Jesuit', 'Priest', 'Pierre', 'Teilhard', 'Chardin', 'might', 'call', 'new', 'Age', 'religion', 'debate', 'presented', 'film', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'very', 'sincere', 'Anyway', 'main', 'Crisis', 'presented', 'film', 'possibility', 'devastating', 'horrific', 'World', 'War', 'how', 'brand-new', 'Ukrainian', 'Pope', 'who', 'also', 'interestingly', 'well-versed', 'Hebrew', 'witnessed', 'crucial', 'moving', 'scene', '>', 'courageously', 'everything', 'humanly', 'possible', 'avert', 'potential', 'global', 'devastation', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'Intriguing', 'even', 'enlightening', 'unfortunately', 'still', 'relevant', 'Times', '==', '>', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'dreamed', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'dealing', 'such', 'persistent', 'worries', '21st', 'Century']",N/A

546102,A2KM1O2P8RA2BJ,B00003OSTW,B. Stockwell,"[3, 3]","Without being pro-Catholic or artificially spiritual, this film is a wonderful exploration of what it means to be ""useful"" in a very profound way.  It's not a tract or an introduction to Catholicism; it could have been about any faith.  It just ""happens"" to be about popes and priests.Anthony Quinn gives an incredibly subtle performance of a man who has spent his life as an outsider. As an archbishop, a 20-year political prisoner, and as an occupant of Vatican City, there is something lost and concerned about him that is - at first - lost on everyone.Unlike ""The Da Vinci Code,"" this film does not assume that religion is a thrilling conspiracy theory. No one is troubled over the ""truth"" of faith, and yet questioning the details is shown as a constant dilemma, as if 2,000 years have passed and there is still debate over what to do as the world changes.  The nuclear war subplot in the film is a bit dated but it is there to bring out the fact that in the world outside the Vatican, a pope is some sort of moral authority but, in the end, can't really DO anything.  With no industrial clout, no military, etc., he's like a fancy-dress version of the Dalai Lama.What stunned me throughout this film was how much trust the film-makers put in a film with little action and a lot of dialog.  There are two tense confrontations in which a priest is calmly asked to explain his writings. I was drawn in by a dramatic discussion of . . . theology? People talk, they pause, reflect, and respond.The film has weaknesses.  There is an occasional travelogue/Rick Steves feeling to the film that seems like it's showing off the size of the film's settings.  Alex North's score hits and misses.  When it hits, it's wonderful; when it doesn't you can really tell. The acting is quiet and intelligent throughout but David Janssen seems to know he's there to explain what you can plainly see happening.  The plot-line involving his marriage is disposable except for a scene in which Quinn offers generic and yet surprisingly intelligent advice to Janssen's wife. This scene justified the otherwise negligible subplot.  Mostly.The film unrolls slowly.  Until you get to the intermission, you enjoy the exposition but might wonder when the real film is going to kick in. By the time you hit the 90-minute mark, you're there.  You don't need to be patient for this film to work but being a good listener might help.My ""Da Vinci Code"" references aren't made to slam that film.  It just stuck me that a film like ""The Shoes of the Fisherman"" would have a hard time getting made today.

One a Russian Bishop (Anthony Quinn) and the other a news journalist (David Janssen). The plot is relatively straightforward, Quinn gets released from internal exile in the Soviet Union and is turned over to the Vatican. He flies to Rome, where he is formally made a Cardinal by the then Pope (John Gielgud). Gielgud subsequently dies and an election is held for a new Pope. Actual footage of the real events of the 1963 election of Pope Paul VI are intermingled into this film. After a number of tied votes, Quinn gets elected as a compromise candidate and becomes the first Pope from an Eastern Bloc country. Quinn becomes the Pope at a time of border disputes between the Soviet Union and China and is forced to intercede, to try and stop a 3rd World War. What makes this film and its script remarkable is that 15 years later, Pope John Paul is actually elected and becomes the first Pope from a Warsaw Pact country.The film gives a wonderful insight into how a Pope is elected and once elected it shows the limitations on their power. The David Janssen, mistress sub plot, feels completely superfluous to the film and adds very little to the overall story.This is a great story with the actual events of the 1963 enclave, intermingled with the fictional parts of the film.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[40, 41]","With the recent passing of Pope John Paul II--and the subsequent Conclave of Cardinals to select his successor--this film came to mind.  Although it was years since I've seen THE SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN, I was able to view it recently, and the pageantry, tradition, and ritual of the Conclave overwhelmed and impressed me once again.Anthony Quinn gives a remarkable performance as Father Kiril Lakota, a Russian political prisoner freed by the Kremlin and dispatched to the Vatican, where he becomes a Cardinal.  Quinn's Kiril is soft-spoken and humble, yet all his years of suffering in Siberia have convinced him the Church must champion human rights--even if blood is shed for that very cause.  His subtle teachings impress his fellow Cardinals, and, when the current Pope dies, after several insufficient votes during the Conclave, Kiril becomes a darkhorse candidate and is eventually selected--despite his vigorous protestations.  Thus concludes the first half of this film, which was fascinating.The second half of the movie deals with Pope Kiril's coronation and infant papacy; here, unfortunately, the film becomes a bit too farfetched.  (Example:  On the evening of his selection as Pope, Kiril sneaks out of the Vatican and wanders the streets of Rome.  Another example:  Kiril's brokerage of a ""deal"" between Russia and China to avoid a nuclear war.)  The Cold War was certainly topical when this film was made in 1968, yet now much of the plot of the second half comes across as contrived and banal--especially Pope Kiril's speech at St. Peter's Square on the day of his coronation.Despite these flaws, THE SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN is grand drama and allows the viewer access to the Vatican behind closed doors.  The cast has considerable star power, including Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir John Gielgud.  Oskar Werner provides an interesting subplot in his portrayal as Father David Telemond, a Vatican scholar under fire for his unorthodox beliefs.  The debate and dialogue between this character and his Vatican counterparts pertaining to a cosmological Supreme Being is absolutely riveting.  This film is definitely worth a look for those interested in ecclesiastical study.--D.

Michael Anderson, 162 minutes official running time, 1968) ~Here we have the slick, wonderfully ahead-of-its-time film version of Morris West's fantastic novel (which would become known as the first of West's so-called ""Vatican Trilogy""). Anthony Quinn is Archbishop Kyril Lakota of Lvov, Ukraine, the imprisoned man in Siberia who is released only to be elected pope.Officially, then, Pope Kyril (he humbly keeps his own name yet upon his election he rumbles, ""We choose to keep our own name,"") is this first foreign pope. Stunning of West to foresee the election of Wojtyla of Poland--and the eerie similarities do not end there. Let me only leave you with one other similarity to ponder: St. John Paul the Great was named Karol.Here, then, we have the first exposition of the election of a pope, very well executed as visualized by West in his novel. We have all the colorful characters we could want: a very fine priest (the immortal Oscar Werner) who becomes Kyril's secretary; a grumpy old lion of a cardinal named Cardinal Leone (the immortal Leo McKern); and a suave Euro-cardinal, Rinaldi (the Great Director and actor Vittorio DeSica); and who can overlook Lord Lawrence Olivier as the Russian Premiere Kaminyev?! [Note the name is misspelled as ""Kamenev"" and Olivier was billed as ""Sir"" Laurence Olivier.]In spite of Morris West doing what would become a hallmark for him--making the pope a saintly winner in the end--viewers miss this very political part of the film. Pope Kyril, a man angrily refusing to be used or manipulated, is manipulated almost every step of the way. No one can escape this. The pope, as the modern Roman emperor, is a scary example.But this story must address ""the power of princes"": the alleged placing of a man in a position of absolute power only to prevent that man from ever really exercising any power. Cardinal Leone actually tells Pope Kyril this in a private conversation. In the end, of course, Pope Kyril winds up holding the upper hand--only because he is a holy man who has been given the chance to exercise that power in full.My point is that up until then, the pope is mercilessly manipulated: by the pope who arranges his release from prison, by the College of Cardinals and the Curia, by his own election and by his own papacy. The fact that West finds a way for the pope to actually do some real good and exercise his power is a coup no one appreciates.If you wish to explore the rest of West's so-called ""Vatican Trilogy"", please read the excellentThe Clowns of God(and see my review).",5,A stunning vision of the future that tells of the papacy now,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,2610,"['SHOES', 'THE', 'FISHERMAN', '[', 'based', 'novel', 'Morris', 'West', ']', 'Dir', 'Michael', 'Anderson', '162', 'minutes', 'official', 'running', 'time', '1968', '~Here', 'have', 'slick', 'wonderfully', 'ahead-of-its-time', 'film', 'version', 'Morris', 'West', 'fantastic', 'novel', 'would', 'become', 'known', 'first', 'West', 'so-called', 'Vatican', 'Trilogy', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Archbishop', 'Kyril', 'Lakota', 'Lvov', 'Ukraine', 'imprisoned', 'man', 'Siberia', 'who', 'released', 'only', 'be', 'elected', 'pope.Officially', 'then', 'Pope', 'Kyril', 'humbly', 'own', 'name', 'yet', 'election', 'choose', 'keep', 'own', 'name', 'first', 'foreign', 'pope', 'Stunning', 'West', 'foresee', 'election', 'Wojtyla', 'Poland', 'eerie', 'similarities', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'there', 'Let', 'only', 'leave', 'one', 'other', 'similarity', 'ponder', 'St.', 'John', 'Paul', 'Great', 'was', 'named', 'Karol.Here', 'then', 'have', 'first', 'exposition', 'election', 'pope', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'visualized', 'West', 'novel', 'have', 'colorful', 'characters', 'could', 'want', 'very', 'fine', 'priest', 'immortal', 'Oscar', 'Werner', 'who', 'Kyril', 'secretary', 'grumpy', 'old', 'lion', 'cardinal', 'named', 'Cardinal', 'Leone', 'immortal', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'suave', 'Euro-cardinal', 'Rinaldi', 'Great', 'Director', 'actor', 'Vittorio', 'DeSica', 'who', 'can', 'overlook', 'Lord', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'Russian', 'Premiere', 'Kaminyev', '[', 'Note', 'name', 'misspelled', 'Kamenev', 'Olivier', 'was', 'billed', 'Sir', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', ']', 'spite', 'Morris', 'West', 'doing', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'hallmark', 'making', 'pope', 'saintly', 'winner', 'end', 'viewers', 'miss', 'very', 'political', 'part', 'film', 'Pope', 'Kyril', 'man', 'angrily', 'refusing', 'be', 'used', 'manipulated', 'manipulated', 'almost', 'step', 'way', 'one', 'can', 'escape', 'pope', 'modern', 'Roman', 'emperor', 'scary', 'example.But', 'story', 'must', 'address', 'power', 'princes', 'alleged', 'placing', 'man', 'position', 'absolute', 'power', 'only', 'prevent', 'man', 'ever', 'really', 'exercising', 'power', 'Cardinal', 'Leone', 'actually', 'Pope', 'Kyril', 'private', 'conversation', 'end', 'course', 'Pope', 'Kyril', 'up', 'holding', 'upper', 'hand', 'only', 'holy', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'exercise', 'power', 'full.My', 'point', 'up', 'then', 'pope', 'mercilessly', 'manipulated', 'pope', 'who', 'release', 'prison', 'College', 'Cardinals', 'Curia', 'own', 'election', 'own', 'papacy', 'fact', 'West', 'way', 'pope', 'actually', 'do', 'real', 'good', 'exercise', 'power', 'coup', 'one', 'appreciates.If', 'wish', 'explore', 'rest', 'West', 'so-called', 'Vatican', 'Trilogy', 'please', 'read', 'excellentThe', 'Clowns', 'God', 'see', 'review']",N/A

He is quickly assigned to the Vatican and made a Cardinal, and befriended by a young German (in the book he's French) priest (Oskar Werner) who is currently under suspicion of herosy and is about to face a ""trial"" among the other Cardinals led by Italian Leoni (Leo Mckern). Suddenly the Pope (John Geilgud) dies.  Werner's trial gets postponed until the college of Cardinals elects a new pope, which ends up being guess who: ""Our Man, Lakota"" (Quinn) making him the first non Italian pope since Hadrian VI (in real life the late John Paul II was the first non Italian since Hadrian) and learns the being pope is almost as lonely as he felt in prison.

546125,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B00003OSTW,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[7, 9]","This movie is remarkable, all the moreso because of the the amount of inadvertent prophecy that takes place during the course of it. Shoes of the Fisherman is a phrase that is sometimes used to refer to the office of the Pope, the Bishop of Rome; the See of Peter, the Chair of Peter, etc., various other historical and scriptural references are a kind of ecclesial shorthand.This story takes place during the height of the Cold War, when it was not primarily a two-way confrontation, but rather seemed to threaten to become a three-way contest with the seeming emergence of China as a communist power independent from the Soviet Union.Archbishop Kyril (Anthony Quinn), longtime political prisoner of the Soviets, is released (the exact reasoning for this we are never told) by his long-time captor (the Soviet premier, played by Laurence Olivier). He is released to Rome, where he is installed as a cardinal for his faithfulness to the church. Shortly thereafter, the pope (John Gielgud, who is on screen for only a few minutes) dies, and an election takes place. Remarkably, Kyril the Russian is elected pope, after giving a moving account of his time in captivity to assembled cardinals weary of the election process, and shortly thereafter commits the church to a risky mercy mission to prevent war from breaking out between the communist powers.Subplots include a very timid (by today's standards) love triangle by a reporter, his wife and his soon-to-be ex-mistress, and an ecclesiastical tribunal examining the works of a radical theologian.This movie had unprecedented vantage of the Vatican for showing the process of a pope's death and succession. The small historical niceties are shown and explained throughout the film. One gets a sense of the procedure and the history.What makes this movie so remarkable is that it was released a full decade before the election of another pope from the communist block. In 1968 it was considered very shocking to consider a non-Italian pope, much less one coming from behind the Iron Curtain.Another prophetic instance is in the ecclesiastical trial of the radical theologian -- during his defense, this theologian even uses the words 'cosmic Christ', and recounts a theological formulation very similar to that which later found expression through Matthew Fox (who used the phrase 'cosmic Christ' in one of his book titles), who was silenced by his Roman order, and who finally had to leave the church to remain true to his convictions.Just how the scriptwriters and director could have foreseen these so far in advance is a mystery.The film is beautiful, well-acted, a bit long in parts, moving in others (the scene where Kyril, during an 'escape' from the Vatican comes across a dying Jewish man and begins to recite Jewish prayers is one of the more moving scenes theologically of any film), and gives a glimpse into a usually hidden, and largely unchanging world.",5,If the shoe fits...,1057968000,"07 12, 2003",2003,2917,"['movie', 'remarkable', 'moreso', 'amount', 'inadvertent', 'prophecy', 'place', 'course', 'Shoes', 'Fisherman', 'phrase', 'sometimes', 'used', 'refer', 'office', 'Pope', 'Bishop', 'Rome', 'See', 'Peter', 'Chair', 'Peter', 'etc.', 'various', 'other', 'historical', 'scriptural', 'references', 'are', 'kind', 'ecclesial', 'shorthand.This', 'story', 'place', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'primarily', 'two-way', 'confrontation', 'rather', 'seemed', 'threaten', 'become', 'three-way', 'contest', 'seeming', 'emergence', 'China', 'communist', 'power', 'independent', 'Soviet', 'Union.Archbishop', 'Kyril', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'longtime', 'political', 'prisoner', 'Soviets', 'released', 'exact', 'reasoning', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'long-time', 'captor', 'Soviet', 'premier', 'played', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'released', 'Rome', 'where', 'installed', 'cardinal', 'faithfulness', 'church', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'pope', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'who', 'screen', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'dies', 'election', 'place', 'Remarkably', 'Kyril', 'Russian', 'elected', 'pope', 'giving', 'moving', 'account', 'time', 'captivity', 'assembled', 'cardinals', 'weary', 'election', 'process', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'church', 'risky', 'mercy', 'mission', 'prevent', 'war', 'breaking', 'out', 'communist', 'powers.Subplots', 'include', 'very', 'timid', 'today', 'standards', 'love', 'triangle', 'reporter', 'wife', 'soon-to-be', 'ex-mistress', 'ecclesiastical', 'tribunal', 'examining', 'works', 'radical', 'theologian.This', 'movie', 'had', 'unprecedented', 'vantage', 'Vatican', 'showing', 'process', 'pope', 'death', 'succession', 'small', 'historical', 'niceties', 'are', 'shown', 'explained', 'film', 'One', 'sense', 'procedure', 'history.What', 'movie', 'so', 'remarkable', 'was', 'released', 'full', 'decade', 'election', 'pope', 'communist', 'block', '1968', 'was', 'considered', 'very', 'shocking', 'consider', 'non-Italian', 'pope', 'much', 'less', 'one', 'coming', 'Iron', 'Curtain.Another', 'prophetic', 'instance', 'ecclesiastical', 'trial', 'radical', 'theologian', 'defense', 'theologian', 'even', 'words', 'Christ', 'theological', 'formulation', 'very', 'similar', 'later', 'found', 'expression', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'who', 'used', 'phrase', ""'cosmic"", 'Christ', 'one', 'book', 'titles', 'who', 'was', 'silenced', 'Roman', 'order', 'who', 'finally', 'had', 'leave', 'church', 'remain', 'true', 'convictions.Just', 'how', 'scriptwriters', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'foreseen', 'so', 'far', 'advance', 'mystery.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'well-acted', 'bit', 'long', 'parts', 'moving', 'others', 'scene', 'where', 'Kyril', ""'escape"", 'Vatican', 'dying', 'Jewish', 'man', 'recite', 'Jewish', 'prayers', 'one', 'more', 'moving', 'scenes', 'theologically', 'film', 'glimpse', 'usually', 'hidden', 'largely', 'unchanging', 'world']",N/A

546141,A366S12KCZ280V,B00003OSTW,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[1, 1]","""The Shoes Of The Fisherman"" is one of those movies that always fasinate me when watching it. While this movie is not in my top 10 favorite movie list it is still a film that I never tire of watching. One reason it is a wonderfully made movie that looks at the inner workings of the Vatican and whether you are a Catholic or not or even if you don't believe in the existance of God will find yourself caught up in how the process works in electing a new Pope. The other reason I never tire of watching this movie is Anthony Quinn. Quinn had a long and distinguish acting career. Too many great movies to list but there are two of his films that are the high marks of his career that really define just how great an actor he was. One of them is ""Zorba The Greek"". The other one is ""The Shoes Of The Fisherman"".""Fisherman"" is the kind of movie they don't make anymore. It is an involving story that fortunately is not hard to follow and while there is a moment or two where the movie drags just a little it still at a pace that keeps you waiting to see what happens next. It is also a movie that relys on the power of the spoken word to provide the tension and suspence that moves the film along. In other words this is a movie with dialog, something you don't find much in movies nowadays. The movie is also a bit dated but remember it was made in 1968 when there still a Soviet Union and a cold war going on. But don't let that stop you from watching this great film. In a readers digest version Communist China is starving to death and is threatening to invade the Soviet Union thus creating possibly World War III as they try to aquire land to help grow the food they need to feed the starving masses. The Soviet government in a move to try and gain support from the free world release Kiril Lakota, a Catholic priest (played by Quinn), who is a politcal prisoner held in one of their gulags. The deal is made that he is to be released to the Vatican. Once Lakota arrives in the Vatican in almost no time the current Pope promotes him to Cardinal. Cardinal Lakota begins to settle in and adjust to life in the Vatican meets and befriends a young priest, played by Oskar Werner, who is causing a stir amoung some of higher ups in the Vatican due to some controversial ideas and beliefs he has. A meeting is set up where the young priest meets with some of the Cardinals who want to understand better just what this priest believes in. As the meeting is in progress the news is suddenly announced that the Pope has died.It is during this point the movie really gets interesting as you get to see the whole process begin when a Pope dies and what takes place upon his death and the process of electing a new Pope. As the Cardinals gather in the movie to find a new Pope they can't agree on who to elect. But as they talk with Lakota and listen to him talk about his time as a political prisoner in the Siberian prison camp and what he endured as a priest in a communist regime the other Cardinals realize who their next Pope should be. Before the Russian priest knows it he is becoming the next leader of the Catholic church.Of course the new Pope will use his influence to try and bring a solution to stop the threat of a third world war from occuring. If there is one complaint I have read in some of the other reviews of this film is the ending. Many think it is too simple or unbelievable of an ending. While I would admit the ending could have been stronger it still to me makes sense how it ends. The proposal that Pope Kiril makes in using the wealth of the Vatican to help the poor and starving in hopes it will prevent war is no different then what Jesus preached to his followers 2,000 years ago about helping the less fortunate.This is just plain and simply a great movie all the way around. Well written and directed. The musical score is inspiring as well. Also lest you think Anthony Quinn was the only good actor in the movie that is not true. There is an all-star cast that helps make ""Fisherman"" such a great movie. Among the cast includes Oskar Werner, David Janssen, Leo McKern, Sir John Gielgud and Sir Laurence Olivier. With a cast like that you know you are going to see an outstanding film. As I mentioned earlier movies like this are just not made anymore. Because of that this is one movie you should watch if you get the chance. I think you will get caught up in the drama and intrigue of this movie as I and many other fans of this film has.",5,Movies Like This Are Not Made Anymore,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,4467,"['Shoes', 'Fisherman', 'one', 'movies', 'always', 'fasinate', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'not', 'top', '10', 'favorite', 'movie', 'list', 'still', 'film', 'never', 'tire', 'watching', 'One', 'reason', 'wonderfully', 'made', 'movie', 'inner', 'workings', 'Vatican', 'are', 'Catholic', 'not', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'existance', 'God', 'will', 'find', 'caught', 'up', 'how', 'process', 'electing', 'new', 'Pope', 'other', 'reason', 'never', 'tire', 'watching', 'movie', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Quinn', 'had', 'long', 'distinguish', 'acting', 'career', 'Too', 'many', 'great', 'movies', 'list', 'are', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'high', 'marks', 'career', 'really', 'define', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'actor', 'was', 'One', 'Zorba', 'Greek', 'other', 'one', 'Shoes', 'Fisherman', 'Fisherman', 'kind', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'involving', 'story', 'fortunately', 'not', 'hard', 'follow', 'moment', 'two', 'where', 'movie', 'just', 'little', 'still', 'pace', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'also', 'movie', 'power', 'spoken', 'word', 'provide', 'tension', 'suspence', 'film', 'along', 'other', 'words', 'movie', 'dialog', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'movie', 'also', 'bit', 'dated', 'remember', 'was', 'made', '1968', 'when', 'still', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'cold', 'war', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'watching', 'great', 'film', 'readers', 'digest', 'version', 'Communist', 'China', 'starving', 'death', 'threatening', 'invade', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'thus', 'creating', 'possibly', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'try', 'aquire', 'land', 'help', 'grow', 'food', 'need', 'feed', 'starving', 'masses', 'Soviet', 'government', 'move', 'try', 'gain', 'support', 'free', 'world', 'release', 'Kiril', 'Lakota', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'played', 'Quinn', 'who', 'politcal', 'prisoner', 'held', 'one', 'gulags', 'deal', 'made', 'be', 'released', 'Vatican', 'Once', 'Lakota', 'Vatican', 'almost', 'time', 'current', 'Pope', 'Cardinal', 'Cardinal', 'Lakota', 'settle', 'adjust', 'life', 'Vatican', 'meets', 'young', 'priest', 'played', 'Oskar', 'Werner', 'who', 'causing', 'stir', 'higher', 'ups', 'Vatican', 'due', 'controversial', 'ideas', 'beliefs', 'meeting', 'set', 'up', 'where', 'young', 'priest', 'meets', 'Cardinals', 'who', 'want', 'understand', 'better', 'just', 'what', 'priest', 'meeting', 'progress', 'news', 'suddenly', 'announced', 'Pope', 'died.It', 'point', 'movie', 'really', 'interesting', 'get', 'see', 'whole', 'process', 'begin', 'when', 'Pope', 'dies', 'what', 'place', 'death', 'process', 'electing', 'new', 'Pope', 'Cardinals', 'gather', 'movie', 'find', 'new', 'Pope', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'who', 'elect', 'talk', 'Lakota', 'listen', 'talk', 'time', 'political', 'prisoner', 'Siberian', 'prison', 'camp', 'what', 'endured', 'priest', 'communist', 'regime', 'other', 'Cardinals', 'realize', 'who', 'next', 'Pope', 'should', 'be', 'Russian', 'priest', 'becoming', 'next', 'leader', 'Catholic', 'church.Of', 'course', 'new', 'Pope', 'will', 'use', 'influence', 'try', 'bring', 'solution', 'stop', 'threat', 'third', 'world', 'war', 'occuring', 'one', 'complaint', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'ending', 'Many', 'think', 'too', 'simple', 'unbelievable', 'ending', 'would', 'admit', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'still', 'sense', 'how', 'proposal', 'Pope', 'Kiril', 'using', 'wealth', 'Vatican', 'help', 'poor', 'starving', 'hopes', 'will', 'prevent', 'war', 'different', 'then', 'what', 'Jesus', 'preached', 'followers', '2,000', 'years', 'ago', 'helping', 'less', 'fortunate.This', 'just', 'plain', 'simply', 'great', 'movie', 'way', 'Well', 'written', 'directed', 'musical', 'score', 'inspiring', 'as', 'well', 'Also', 'lest', 'think', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'actor', 'movie', 'not', 'true', 'all-star', 'cast', 'make', 'Fisherman', 'such', 'great', 'movie', 'cast', 'Oskar', 'Werner', 'David', 'Janssen', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Sir', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'cast', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'outstanding', 'film', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'made', 'anymore', 'one', 'movie', 'should', 'watch', 'get', 'chance', 'think', 'will', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'drama', 'intrigue', 'movie', 'many', 'other', 'fans', 'film']",N/A

Faced with the slave pens of Goree Island, an anguished John Paul II reflects that the horrors of the Slave trade were perpetrated by those ""who claimed to be baptized.""The movie may be a flawed gem, but it doesn't hesitate to ask the most fundamental questions. And if those questions weren't being asked in the commercial media in the late sixties; well it isn't any better now.When was the last time any of these questions were asked in a minor much less major film or even in the local paper? What is man's relationship with God? If God is responsible for all that happens in Creation, how do we account for the existence of evil, poverty and despair? How do we reconcile intellectual and personal freedom with spiritual obedience? I don't find the Oskar Werner plot line ambiguous at all. The question ""what think you of Christ?"" is fundamental for all believers. And what happens when an honest believer's understanding of the answer to that question differs from accepted dogma? We're still trying to answer that question after how many thousand years? The film offers no easy answer to any of these questions.While the risk of large scale nuclear annihilation may have receded since the sixties we still face a possible future ""where the earth may be blackened and there will be no flowers any more for any of us.""And I do love Kyril's short term solution when he realizes that he has traded a Siberian gulag for a gilded cage.

546161,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00003OSTW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","This 1968 film, based on Morris West's novel, has Anthony Quinn as Kiril Lakota, released after twenty years in a Siberian work camp to become a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church and then Pope at a time when the Soviet Union and a starving People's Republic of China are about to go to war. The idea that the first non-Italian pope in centuries would be from a Communist country certainly seems prophetic today, but in the 1960s no one could imagine such a turn of events. Lakota is released by the Soviet Premier (Laurence Olivier), who is taking a chance that a sympathetic Vatican might tip the balance of the world towards peace. Lakota emerges from imprisonment as something of a saint, admired by the Elder Pope (John Gielgud) for having refused to deny the faith even when seven priests were brought before him and shot.Although the obvious comparison is to John Paul II, Quinn's pontiff is actually more like John Paul I, who was considered a &quot;pastoral&quot; Pope, capable of relating to the people more on the level of a parish priest than as a prince of the Vatican. When he is elected and has to change into his papal robes, he introduces himself to his new valet saying simply,&quot;I am Kiril Lakota.&quot; The politically charged atmosphere is a bit melodramatic, but the strength of this film is in its portrait of the inner workings of the Vatican where both politics and personalities come into play. My favorite scene is when the college of Cardinals are deadlocked, repeated votes having been &quot;insufficient for election,&quot; and one of the elder statesmen of the church stands up to declare his belief that God has sent them the man intended to be the next Pope. With growing horror, Lakota watches as the momentum builds for his stunning election (Now if somebody could just explain to me, when reporter David Janssen announces &quot;They have elected a Russian Pope&quot; is the word &quot;Russia&quot; an adjective or a noun in that sentence? This has been driving me crazy for other 30 years).Of the two subplots the romantic estrangement of Dan Janssen, the reporter covering the Vatican and his doctor wife, Barbara Jefford, is trivial soap opera nonsense, although it does lead to a nice scene where the Pope sneaks out of the Vatican disguised as an ordinary priest. The doctor sends him to the pharmacy for medicine and is stunned when he returns and is able to do prayers in Hebrew over the dying man. The other, with Oskar Werner as Father David Telemond, is much more provocative and provides an interesting counter-point to the main story line. Telemond has written several books, none of them published, dealing with what he calls the &quot;Cosmic Christ.&quot; A Pontifical Commission is investigating his writings as being heretical. Certainly there is a sense in which this film, in the wake of the Vatican II Council, was trying to confront the Catholic Church with certain issues. Ultimately &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; is a much more subversive film than &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ,&quot; though few would suspect this at first glance.Quinn's dignified performance holds &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; together, aided by Leo McKern and Vittorio De Sica as a pair of Cardinals seated high in the Church hierarchy. This is not a great film by any means, but it is certainly thoughtful even without the provocative final scene in which the new pope proposes to actually implement &quot;the authentic Christian revolution: work for all, bread for all, dignity for all men.&quot; It works because is treats it characters and its subject matter with great seriousness.

I tried to watch it, but I'm not a Catholic, and I thought all that pomp and circumstance to be absurd, very expensive, not to mention the awful things going on in the Catholic Church today that we've all heard or read about. I kept hoping the fairy tale would get better, less boring and tell the truth. It couldn't compare with DOUBT. (Meryl Streep) A movie about a Catholic school which really frightened me. But perhaps that's a look at the real Church. Streep was great, as always,  but I ""doubt"" the nuns act that way anymore. At least I hope not.I hoped Quinn (whom I didn't care for in this role at all) would come to find out what the real Church is all about, and how unnecessary his sacrifices were. One empire for another. No freedom of speech in either.The conversation he had with the satisfied bishops in the Vatican that 5 men were shot and killed because Quinn refused to recant. What? Isn't life more important than words! So, five men died. The Pope approved. Well, I guess that said a lot. He let 5 men die because he wouldn't recant. So, how's the Church any different from the tyrants who put him in the camps?Historically, the Church has always been about wars, money and power. From the early Roman Church, to the Crusades to the Inquisition and beyond. The Russian Church was always in bed with the czars and their money and was tyrannical as well. Perhaps he learned something in the end, but the movie was so long and moved so slow, I got tired and bored of waiting, wondering if Quinn would ever see the truth of it all.Finally turned it off, and put on something else I found much more interesting.

546166,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00003OSTW,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","This is an excellent and very powerful film, which greatly impressed me. The review which follows contains some limited SPOILERS.This is an adaptation of the bestselling novel ""Shoes of the Fisherman"", written by Morris West and published in 1963. The film, turned five years later, is very faithful to the book. Action is situated in the 80s and the story begins when an Ukrainian catholic priest, Kiril Lakota, Archbishop of Lvov (Lviv for Ukrainians), is released after spending twenty years in one of Soviet concentration camps. Soviet government ""authorises"" him then to ""leave the country"" - which really means that he is expelled and banished from Soviet Union. After reporting to Vatican, he is received by the Pope who welcomes him warmly and creates him Cardinal.Then, soon after, the old Pope dies and a long conclave begins - when in the same time the tension between China and Soviet Union brings those countries to the edge of war, which risks to inflame the whole planet... As you can see it at on the cover of DVD, Cardinal Lakota will become Pope, to the greatest surprise of the whole world (""It is the Russian! They've elected a Russian Pope""). Most of this pretty long film covers the very eventful, dramatic and even tragic first weeks of his pontificate.This film contains many treasures. The conclave part is an extraordinary thing to watch, probably the best representation of this unique event ever shown on the screen. Dialogs are of the highest quality. There are also some extremely moving and beautiful scenes.Anthony Quinn is of course the main star in this show and he proves here once again that he is a real Hollywood giant. Before this film he already played (amongst others) a Greek commando soldier, a French general, a US Marine, a Philippino guerilla, a Spanish conquistador, an American gunfighter, an Inuit hunter, an Arab sheik, and also Kublai Khan, Attila, Barabbas, Gauguin, Osceola, Zapata, Quasimodo and of course he was also Zorba the Greek and he starred in the immortal ""La Strada"". Here he is simply perfect as a very great and exceptionnally wise Pope...Two other actors seconded him in the most excellent way. Austrian actor Oskar Werner plays here a brilliant theologian, Father Telemond, who is however going in his reflections very far from the official line of the Church - and he is great in this role. Australian actor Leo McKern (Number Two in ""The Prisoner"" series) plays the crucially important character of Cardinal Leone and he does even better. Finally, Laurence Oliver, John Gielgud and Vittorio De Sica appear in smaller but significant roles.Being a Roman-Catholic myself I found the respectful approach to Christian faith and Catholic Church a very pleasant thing and a welcome change from the usual Catholic bashing in most of more recent films. As the title of this review (which is a citation from the film) indicates, living one's faith is a great challenge, priesthood is a life of duty and never stopping service to others and becoming Pope is to combine those two things at the highest possible level of difficulty...This film can also be seen as a quasi prophecy about the election of Pope John Paul II in 1978: he was also coming from the Eastern bloc, his election was a total surprise, he improved the relations of the Church with the Jews and also in many other ways his pontificate was dramatic and very exceptionnal.If there is one thing that is rather weak in this otherwise great film, it is the description of the crisis which threatens world peace and a very naive vision of both Soviet and Chinese leaderships. Also, the ""great solution"" the Pope invents at the end is, in my private opinion, an extraordinarily naive and pretty stupid thing...

546167,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00003OSTW,MadMacs,"[1, 1]","This film was and continues to be an inspiration for me. Too many will see that as a 'Christian' statement, but that would be overly simplistic and flat-out wrong.Inspirational because the journey we take with Anthony Quinn's character, Kiril Lakota, is one of selfless devotion and unwanted authority. A man who, like his predecessor two-thousand years previous, took on the responsibility of maintaining the church despite his own fears and acknowledged inadequacies; a simple fisherman who reluctantly carried on the message of his teacher.This is a powerful and deeply felt film about sacrifice, both personal and spiritual, that gives everyone a chance to see Christ's message through a clear and humbling story *without* the typically blatant evangelistic proselytizing so typical in productions coming from that part of the industry.'Fisherman' tells the story of an imprisoned Catholic cleric, a man who has spent over twenty years in the Soviet Gulag prison system. Two decades suffering in Siberia, suddenly thrust back into the modern world because of a bizarre kinship he shared with an ambitious internal security officer who, over those same years, rose to become the Chairman of the Soviet Union and absolute authority of 1/3 of the planet.Pyotr Illyich Kamenev, played by Laurence Olivier, leader of the USSR, reaches into his past and tells the priest that he's going to be freed, for whatever that's worth. It's a gift that Kiril is understandably suspicious of, more than just the reason for his release, but from whom it is delivered. Why? Because Kamenev knows something that the priest does not: Within a short time it's likely that most of the world will be engulfed in nuclear fire. For Kamenev - a final act of mercy before Armaggedon.I would be remiss not to mention the wonderful presence of one of my all-time favorite actors, Clive Revill, who, along with Olivier's character, stand in for the number-crunching atheists of our times. And what can you say about the utterly fantastic Leo McKern, as Cardinal Leon&eacute;, that hasn't already been said a thousand times before and by better reviewers than myself.Then there's the sidestory, which some cinephiles find distracting: David Janssen's news anchor who flirts with marital disaster while chronicling the events that surround Pope Kiril and the impending nuclear war between China and the other world powers. While some find it pointless - I actually enjoyed Janssen's character and storyline. Particularly when the estranged wife and his Holiness unexpectedly meet in the rough-n-tumble streets of Rome itself. There's a touch of my mustachioed hero, Mark Twain, in that scene that perfectly imparts both humor and poignancy into the film when it's needed.To each his own I suppose.Perhaps the most important moment, save for the film's final act, and the one that in my view best illustrates 'sacrifice' - comes when his Holiness is confronted by Cardinal Leon&eacute;. The scene reveals the price he paid accepting ascension to the Holy See. He would suffer greatly as Pope; that his was the loneliest path a man could walk, and that his suffering had only begun. Calvary indeed.An incredible and timeless film that I recommend to anyone who wants to experience gut-wrenching sacrifice for the betterment of others, regardless of what you believe.Film Note: What amazes me, and many historians, is the uncanny prescience author Morris West achieved by predating the rise and election of Pope John Paul II; considered by many, including myself, as one of the preeminent spiritual leaders of the last century. A man whose life and times nearly mirror that of the fictional Kiril Lakota, former Metropolitan Archbishop of Lviv, Ukraine.",5,"Sacrifice - Personal and Spiritual, Powerfully Inspirational",1320969600,"11 11, 2011",2011,3722,"['film', 'was', 'be', 'inspiration', 'Too', 'many', 'will', 'see', ""'Christian"", 'statement', 'would', 'be', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'flat-out', 'wrong.Inspirational', 'journey', 'take', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'character', 'Kiril', 'Lakota', 'one', 'selfless', 'devotion', 'unwanted', 'authority', 'man', 'who', 'predecessor', 'two-thousand', 'years', 'previous', 'took', 'responsibility', 'maintaining', 'church', 'own', 'fears', 'acknowledged', 'inadequacies', 'simple', 'fisherman', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'carried', 'message', 'teacher.This', 'powerful', 'deeply', 'felt', 'film', 'sacrifice', 'personal', 'spiritual', 'everyone', 'chance', 'see', 'Christ', 'message', 'clear', 'humbling', 'story', 'typically', 'blatant', 'evangelistic', 'proselytizing', 'so', 'typical', 'productions', 'coming', 'part', 'industry', 'story', 'imprisoned', 'Catholic', 'cleric', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'twenty', 'years', 'Soviet', 'Gulag', 'prison', 'system', 'Two', 'decades', 'suffering', 'Siberia', 'suddenly', 'back', 'modern', 'world', 'bizarre', 'kinship', 'shared', 'ambitious', 'internal', 'security', 'officer', 'who', 'same', 'years', 'rose', 'become', 'Chairman', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'absolute', 'authority', '1/3', 'planet.Pyotr', 'Illyich', 'Kamenev', 'played', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'leader', 'USSR', 'past', 'priest', 'going', 'be', 'freed', 'whatever', 'worth', 'gift', 'Kiril', 'understandably', 'suspicious', 'more', 'just', 'reason', 'release', 'whom', 'delivered', 'Why', 'Kamenev', 'something', 'priest', 'not', 'short', 'time', 'likely', 'most', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'engulfed', 'nuclear', 'fire', 'Kamenev', 'final', 'act', 'mercy', 'Armaggedon.I', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'not', 'mention', 'wonderful', 'presence', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Clive', 'Revill', 'who', 'Olivier', 'character', 'stand', 'number-crunching', 'atheists', 'times', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'utterly', 'fantastic', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'Cardinal', 'Leon', 'eacute', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'thousand', 'times', 'better', 'reviewers', 'myself.Then', 'sidestory', 'cinephiles', 'find', 'distracting', 'David', 'Janssen', 'news', 'anchor', 'who', 'marital', 'disaster', 'chronicling', 'events', 'surround', 'Pope', 'Kiril', 'impending', 'nuclear', 'war', 'China', 'other', 'world', 'powers', 'find', 'pointless', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'Janssen', 'character', 'storyline', 'Particularly', 'when', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Holiness', 'unexpectedly', 'rough-n-tumble', 'streets', 'Rome', 'touch', 'mustachioed', 'hero', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'humor', 'poignancy', 'film', 'when', 'needed.To', 'own', 'suppose.Perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'moment', 'save', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'one', 'view', 'best', ""'sacrifice"", 'when', 'Holiness', 'confronted', 'Cardinal', 'Leon', 'eacute', 'scene', 'price', 'paid', 'accepting', 'ascension', 'Holy', 'See', 'would', 'suffer', 'greatly', 'Pope', 'was', 'loneliest', 'path', 'man', 'could', 'walk', 'suffering', 'had', 'only', 'begun', 'Calvary', 'indeed.An', 'incredible', 'timeless', 'film', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'experience', 'gut-wrenching', 'sacrifice', 'betterment', 'others', 'regardless', 'what', 'believe.Film', 'Note', 'What', 'many', 'historians', 'uncanny', 'prescience', 'author', 'Morris', 'West', 'achieved', 'predating', 'rise', 'election', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'considered', 'many', 'including', 'one', 'preeminent', 'spiritual', 'leaders', 'last', 'century', 'man', 'life', 'times', 'nearly', 'mirror', 'fictional', 'Kiril', 'Lakota', 'former', 'Metropolitan', 'Archbishop', 'Lviv', 'Ukraine']",N/A

Shortly after that, the pope dies and they have to go through the elaborate process of selecting a new pope - and of course, they choose the surprised Quinn.If you're a Catholic, this is probably a ""must see"" - but even if you aren't it's very interesting.The costumes are totally elaborate and ridiculous but they are, I believe, the real deal.Fantastic story, fantastic cast, incredible footage (even if it's not perfect HD) - this movie is a MUST SEE.--------------------------------NOTE:I watched this epic (which is based on the book by Morris L.

546180,A2FNBA2IE59Q7V,B00003OSTW,"NUC MED TECH ""T.L.E.""","[3, 4]","The 1968 film SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN gives us a privilaged view of the inner workings of the Vaticana as direct result of the death of one Pope and the election of another.  The main character is Kiril Lakota, a Ukranian Eastern Rite Catholic bishop serving a 20 year sentence in a Soviet work camp in Siberia.  We're never told why he is there.  The Chairman of the U.S.S.R.,Pitor Ilyich Kamenev, played by  Sir Lawrence Olivier, brokers a deal with the Vatican to set Lakota free and return him to the West, all with very little public fanfare.  In fact, the predictably crayola-dull David Jansen character of George Faber, an American reporter working for the BBC in Rome, is offered the story as an exclusive.  Faber's character latter annoys us to no end with his petty affair with a English speaking presumably Italian teenie type tart, as opposed to his genuinely attractive, yet cold and distant doctor wife.  A troubled marraige that certainly seems salvagable, but who would want to live life with such a drag as Jansen?  Anyhow, no  sooner is Bishop Lakota released than he is promoted to Cardinal by Sir John Gielgood's Pope Pius XIII, than the Holy Father dies.  For the non-Catholic fans in the audience, Pius XIII seems very plausible, since he would have been the successopr to Pius XII, the Church's last reasonably conservative pope.  This, of course, is fiction.  After the shortand some say suspicious demise of John Paul I, we got a very different pontiff, John Paul II.  We also have in the story , the personage of, likely the real-life priest Teilhard de Chardin, in the movie role of Fr. David Telremond, played by Oscar Werner.  This young priest is a brilliant theologian and an amateur paleantologist, and has written several books, all unpublished, concerning the dilemma of a ""cosmic Christ.""  This is a questuion which the Werner's character struggles with to the point of  great torment, eventually he dies due to a cerebral tumor and hemmorage.  Perhaps his very real medical crisis has influenced his theology?During a coffee break for the sequestered Cardinals in the Sistine Chapel papal election process, Lakota is asked about his life in prison camp, and though these are innocent questions from well-meaning cardinals, he relates that sometimes extreme measures are necessary to defend life and liberties, a theme that was close to the heart of the author Morris West.  To the shock of his brother cardinals, he admits he stole bread and fed it to a prisoner who had been beated by a gaurd, and on another occassion, he fought a brutal guard and nearly killed him to defend another man.  The stoic Cardinal Rinaldi, played by  Vitorrio de Sica, and looking every bit like a REAL prince of the Church, is deeply moved by this confession, and upon the resumption of the afternoon election session, rises to proclaim Lakota as ""being touched by  the hand of God.""  He pleges his loyalty and obedience to him as the next pope.  Soon another cardinal follows suit, and another until a majority is evident.  Lakota nearly panics and only after looking deeply within himself, doe he accept election.  The immediate and unselfish display of love, brotherhiood and allegiance shown by the group of cardinals is proof of the Church's wonderful gift of speaking with one voice to themselves, and now, more than ever in history, must speak also to the world.  Pope Lakota I must now confront that crisis which he became privy to the day of his release from Soviet internment.  The Communist Chinese military is threatening to invade Soviet territory rich in rice , minerals and other necessities because of the extreme hardships of the Chinese peple and the waves of famine decimating their country.  The U.S.S.R. thinks the relaes of Lakota could help temper the situation, but they never contemplated a UKRANIAN POPE!!!  Now what?Lakota I agrees to meet with the beligerant parties and after tense negotiations, returns to the Vatican to announce his decision to his circle of theological advisors.  Nearly all are opposed, if not at least severely skeptical.  Only Cardinal Leone, Leo McKern, supports him unequivically.  He says to Lakota, ""tu est Petrus.""  You are Peter.  Enough said.  Earlier, Leone came to the Holy Father to confess his sin of jelousy, aimed at the young Fr. Telremond, now deceased, because, as Leone says, ""I though I deserved your attention and affection, because I am old.""  Initially, the pope shuns his request for absolution, but Leone reminds the pontiff, with the greatest respect, that ""you ARE a priest, and I am a soul in distress.""  How true.The finale of the film is the announcement, on the day of his coronation, that the Church will give all her wealth, her art treasuers, her lands, her money for the releif of the starving masses in China, as well as any others in such need.  He proclaims this from the balcony of the Vatican and beseaches the weathy nations of the world to follow suit.  At first, the crowd is near silent, then slowly, the cheers begin to rise.  Idealist?  yes, maybe.  Impossible?  not really.  As a Catholic, I can tell you that while St thomas Aquinas and St Dominic were two of our greatest, so were Sts. Benedict and Francis and, especially my guy, St Anthony of Padua, born filthy-rich and abandonned it for the calling of penitence and poverty and prayer.  And, still the Church survived.  This is a very fine film for me personally, in light of my understanding of the post-vatican II Catholic Faith, an understanding which I continue to learn about and which I find vitaly necessary as an insight into this movies's plot and characters.  Highly recommeded to all faiths.God Bless You.",5,IN THE WAKE OF VATICAN II,1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,5685,"['1968', 'film', 'SHOES', 'THE', 'FISHERMAN', 'privilaged', 'view', 'inner', 'workings',

546183,A2HL1E00Q658VI,B00003OSTW,Paul The Greater,"[0, 0]","THE SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN is an uneasy film.  It's good, but not good enough.  Filmed in 1968, it projected itself into into a futuristic vision of our world in the 1980s.  It stars the late Anthony Quinn, a Mexican-American actor with a knack for being present in films with a large cast of ""important actors"" and holding his own among them. In SHOES he becomes Pope, after the death of the old Pope played by John Geilgud, whose performance is so good because it's so bad.  I suspect he was modelled after Pius XII, the great ascetic Pope of W.W.II, and Geilgud's idea of that is to play ""The Queen of the White Robes"".  (In fact, anyone working in the Vatican during the reign of Pius XII had to kneel when answering a phone call from him.)  The shoes that Quinn wears as THE FISHERMAN  are more leathery.THE SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN includes the likes of Laurence Olivier, David Jansen (whom I don't recall ever giving a poor performance when working within his range), Vittorio De Sica, Oscar Werner.  Unfortunately, THE FISHERMAN was filmed in the 1960s, when Hollywood dealt with Vatican affairs in language a little too reverent for words.My snide remarks aside, THE SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN makes for a pleasant watch.  It's well filmed, adequately directed.  THE FISHERMAN is adapted from Morris West's novel that looks at the world with idealistic wishful thinking.  But who can deny that the world would be a very much better place if such wishful thinking were to become wise thinking.Amazon has it, reasonably priced as always.Peace,P the G",4,Whose Shoes?,1340323200,"06 22, 2012",2012,1551,"['SHOES', 'THE', 'FISHERMAN', 'uneasy', 'film', 'good', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'Filmed', '1968', 'projected', 'futuristic', 'vision', 'world', '1980s', 'late', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Mexican-American', 'actor', 'knack', 'being', 'present', 'films', 'large', 'cast', 'important', 'actors', 'holding', 'own', 'SHOES', 'Pope', 'death', 'old', 'Pope', 'played', 'John', 'Geilgud', 'performance', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'bad', 'suspect', 'was', 'modelled', 'Pius', 'XII', 'great', 'ascetic', 'Pope', 'W.W.II', 'Geilgud', 'idea', 'play', 'Queen', 'White', 'Robes', 'fact', 'anyone', 'working', 'Vatican', 'reign', 'Pius', 'XII', 'had', 'kneel', 'when', 'answering', 'phone', 'call', 'shoes', 'Quinn', 'THE', 'FISHERMAN', 'are', 'more', 'leathery.THE', 'SHOES', 'THE', 'FISHERMAN', 'likes', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'David', 'Jansen', 'whom', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'giving', 'poor', 'performance', 'when', 'working', 'range', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'Oscar', 'Werner', 'Unfortunately', 'THE', 'FISHERMAN', 'was', 'filmed', '1960s', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'dealt', 'Vatican', 'affairs', 'language', 'little', 'too', 'reverent', 'words.My', 'snide', 'remarks', 'aside', 'THE', 'SHOES', 'THE', 'FISHERMAN', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'well', 'filmed', 'adequately', 'directed', 'FISHERMAN', 'adapted', 'Morris', 'West', 'novel', 'world', 'idealistic', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'who', 'can', 'deny', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'better', 'place', 'such', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'were', 'become', 'wise', 'thinking.Amazon', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'always.Peace', 'P', 'G']",N/A

This film has all the ingredients of greatness, but somehow the chef messed up. For example, a significant plot in this film, consuming considerable time, is about a dying young priest at the Vatican who's writings are considered heretical. The whole thing is ambiguous. We are never allowed to understand what it was really all about, this bothered me. Olivier's role in this film is very limited but fascinating, as a Soviet official engineering the release of Quinn from an East Block country. But it's barely a footnote in this long film. David Jansen's role seems lost or out of place all together. He's a Vatican reporter who's soap opera private life is like frequently interjected TV commercials, just terrible. The idea behind this film is excellent, it's beautifully filmed, and Quinn's performance is quite good. Far and away the best part of this film is the election process of the next pontiff. It holds some good drama, with a fascinating inside look at the ancient process. But it's the core of the film and it didn't last very long. This is one that easily should have been better, but it still has enough going for it to be worth your time.P.S. -- 1-2-13 -- I just watched this film for the second time and I must say that it is a good deal better than I gave it credit for originally on first viewing. One thing that I think helped a lot this time is that this time I fast-forwarded thru the soup opera scenes with David Jansen which I would say was not in the least germane to this story. I think that helped a lot to avoid the annoyance I had when I first watched it some time ago. And my criticism above about the dying young priest and his writings and feelings not explained well is not the case. I got it this time, .. and I think it was done very well, ... especially given the time when this film was made. There is so much that is unique and sensitive and entertaining about this film.

M Simon ""El Simon Asombroso""","[3, 3]","The film in general:  SHOES of the FISHERMAN is a very Roman Catholic, very 1968 look at the papal selection process and the role of the papacy in a hypothetical world political-military crisis.The basic plot: Kiril Lakota, the Catholic Archbishop of Lvov, is set free and sent to Rome, where he's swiftly made a Cardinal. When the pope dies, he's an unlikely dark horse.  He must now deal with matters of faith, personal conscience and a brewing state of crisis - a famine in China may lead the PRC to invade the USSR and/or SE Asia.  Can the Holy Father help?Film strengths:  Awesome acting from Anthony Quinn as the new pope, Lawrence Olivier as the Soviet premier, John Guielgud as the old pope and especially Oscar Werner as a free-thinking priest and the late Leo McKern as a jealous but wise old Cardinal.  Unbelievable cinematography just wonderfully highlights the unprecedented access to the Vatican.So-So's:  The plot isn't that credible and probably overestimates the powers of the Papacy to influence temporal events.  David Janssen serves a necessarily role as the journalist who explains the Vatican's inner workings but the sub-plot with his mediocre-libertine 1968 swinging is lame.genuine downers:  The bombastic soundtrack and the inclusion of an ""overture"" and ""intermission"" are pretentious and dated.  (SPOILER COMING!!!) The quick wrap-up of the plot, where all the Vatican has do do is divest itself of art treasures and property to make the world happy and safe is another lame spot.  Also more than moderately unbelievable is that a crypto-Christian Soviet leader would turn to a Catholic priest from western Ukraine and not a Russian Orthodox one!Overall:  Worth watching.  The acting and camera work alone make it worthwhile.  The film also has great respect for Rome, and gives a lot of special and well-presented insight into the workings of the Vatican.The CD:  Great picture and sound.

Knowing how i feel about the church and the riches that the church has only made me feel more like buying another DVD and sending it to Rome just for the last scene of this film.I guess that's why this film could be non fiction but the conclusion is really fiction.

Telemond is the author of ten books none published, with works under examination by a special Pontifical Commission... He is suspected of holding opinions dangerous to the faith...Discussing one of his book, Kiril states to the young philosopher that 'faith' kept him alive... Kiril makes it clear that he finds Telemond's book, a challenge to the Catholic faith... Not one word of the 'soul' was there mentioned...Before the Pontifical Commission, Father Telemond manifests: 'I believe in the future union of the world with the cosmic Christ.' He is interrupted by an announcement that the Pope has passed away... The film shows how the Pope's ring is defaced, his seals broken, his apartments locked and sealed...Cardinals from all over the world arrive to the Vatican City for the election of the new Pope... The Cardinals are pleased by Lakota's ideas: 'Life is a gift of God,' he declares. 'We should manufacture the authentic Christian revolution... Work for all... Bread for all... Dignity for all men...'To the surprise of the outside world, he is elevated to the throne of St. Peter by the College of Cardinals led by Cardinal Rinaldi (Vittorio De Sica).Kamenev, the pragmatic Russian premier (Laurence Olivier) congratulates the elected Pontiff and sends him a gift... The gift had its meaning for the Russian Pope... Kamenev, who was once Kiril's hated interrogator, is anxious to avoid war with China... He turns to Kiril, now spiritual leader of 800 million people, for help...Kiril, bound to charity with a duty to act, begins to understand the cruel world he knows so little about... He could not even remember that he is Peter!... He is remembered that he just starts to climb his calvary...Anthony Quinn plays with human characterization the tormented Russian priest plagued by self-doubt... He is dispatched to Rome so that Russia will have a friend in the papal court in case China should rise against her...Laurence Olivier plays the tormentor Russian Premier who does not count on the fact, of course, that the one-time Siberian prisoner will ultimately become the new Pope...Oskar Werner is excellent as Father Telemond, the silenced theologian who believes that 'man is born in bondage to his own history.' Father Telemond shows a brilliant mind reaching out to the last frontiers of thought... He lives a deep spirituality with extraordinary depth and beauty, but fails to live in peace in a church he dearly loves...Leo McKern portrays Cardinal Leone who had preferred to be a country priest rather than a 'walking encyclopedia of dogma.' Cardinal Leone is jealous of Father Telemond, jealous that he has the intimacy, trust and affection of the elected Pontiff...There are several subplots in the film, one of which includes a romantic triangle with a television reporter (David Janssen), his doctor wife (Barbara Jefford) and the Italian girlfriend (Rosemary Dexter) who won't let him go... Kiril, as Pope, is carried into this when, sneaking out of the walls of the Vatican to mingle anonymously with the crowds, he accidentally encounters Dr. Ruth Faber and helps her solve her marital problems while they are both attending a dying Jew... The scene remembers us the European princess, Audrey Hepburn, in her ""incognito"" informal tour of Rome, out of Palace duties, in William Wyler's ""Roman Holiday.""Based on Morris West's best-selling novel, ""The Shoes of the Fisherman"" is a super special chance to tour inside the Roman Catholic Church, discover dynamic performances, but plenty of turbulent questions that were needed to be answered...",4,A super special chance to tour inside the Roman Catholic Church...,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,3973,"['Kiril', 'Lakota', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Russian', 'priest', 'suddenly', 'released', 'Siberia', 'twenty', 'years', 'imprisonment', 'brought', 'Rome', 'arrival', 'Vatican', 'Archbishop', 'Lakota', 'received', 'prince', 'immediately', 'created', 'Cardinal', 'Priest', 'ailing', 'Pope', 'John', 'Gielgud', '.Lakota', 'friendship', 'Father', 'David', 'Telemond', 'Oskar', 'Werner', 'unorthodox', 'Jesuit', 'forbidden', 'teach', 'Telemond', 'author', 'ten', 'books', 'none', 'published', 'works', 'examination', 'special', 'Pontifical', 'Commission', 'suspected', 'holding', 'opinions', 'dangerous', 'faith', 'Discussing', 'one', 'book', 'Kiril', 'young', 'philosopher', ""'faith"", 'kept', 'alive', 'Kiril', 'clear', 'Telemond', 'book', 'challenge', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'Not', 'one', 'word', ""'soul"", 'was', 'there', 'mentioned', 'Pontifical', 'Commission', 'Father', 'Telemond', 'manifests', 'believe', 'future', 'union', 'world', 'cosmic', 'Christ', 'interrupted', 'announcement', 'Pope', 'passed', 'away', 'film', 'how', 'Pope', 'ring', 'defaced', 'seals', 'broken', 'apartments', 'locked', 'sealed', 'Cardinals', 'world', 'arrive', 'Vatican', 'City', 'election', 'new', 'Pope', 'Cardinals', 'are', 'pleased', 'Lakota', 'ideas', ""'Life"", 'gift', 'God', 'should', 'manufacture', 'authentic', 'Christian', 'revolution', 'Work', 'Bread', 'Dignity', 'men', 'surprise', 'outside', 'world', 'elevated', 'throne', 'St.', 'Peter', 'College', 'Cardinals', 'led', 'Cardinal', 'Rinaldi', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', '.Kamenev', 'pragmatic', 'Russian', 'premier', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'elected', 'Pontiff', 'gift', 'gift', 'had', 'meaning', 'Russian', 'Pope', 'Kamenev', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'Kiril', 'hated', 'interrogator', 'anxious', 'avoid', 'war', 'China', 'Kiril', 'now', 'spiritual', 'leader', '800', 'million', 'people', 'help', 'Kiril', 'bound', 'charity', 'duty', 'act', 'understand', 'cruel', 'world', 'so', 'little', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'remember', 'Peter', 'remembered', 'just', 'climb', 'calvary', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'human', 'characterization', 'tormented', 'Russian', 'priest', 'plagued', 'self-doubt', 'dispatched', 'Rome', 'Russia', 'will', 'have', 'friend', 'papal', 'court', 'case', 'China', 'should', 'rise', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'tormentor', 'Russian', 'Premier', 'who', 'not', 'count', 'fact', 'course', 'one-time', 'Siberian', 'prisoner', 'will', 'ultimately', 'become', 'new', 'Pope', 'Oskar', 'Werner', 'excellent', 'Father', 'Telemond', 'silenced', 'theologian', 'who', ""'man"", 'born', 'bondage', 'own', 'history', 'Father', 'Telemond', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'reaching', 'out', 'last', 'frontiers', 'thought', 'deep', 'spirituality', 'extraordinary', 'depth', 'beauty', 'live', 'peace', 'church', 'loves', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'Cardinal', 'Leone', 'who', 'had', 'preferred', 'be', 'country', 'priest', 'rather', ""'walking"", 'encyclopedia', 'dogma', 'Cardinal', 'Leone', 'jealous', 'Father', 'Telemond', 'jealous', 'intimacy', 'trust', 'affection', 'elected', 'Pontiff', 'are', 'several', 'subplots', 'film', 'one', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'television', 'reporter', 'David', 'Janssen', 'doctor', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'Jefford', 'Italian', 'girlfriend', 'Rosemary', 'Dexter', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'Kiril', 'Pope', 'carried', 'when', 'sneaking', 'walls', 'Vatican', 'mingle', 'anonymously', 'crowds', 'accidentally', 'Dr.', 'Ruth', 'Faber', 'solve', 'marital', 'problems', 'are', 'attending', 'dying', 'Jew', 'scene', 'remembers', 'European', 'princess', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'incognito', 'informal', 'tour', 'Rome', 'Palace', 'duties', 'William', 'Wyler', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'Based', 'Morris', 'West', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'Shoes', 'Fisherman', 'super', 'special', 'chance', 'tour', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'discover', 'dynamic', 'performances', 'plenty', 'turbulent', 'questions', 'were', 'needed', 'be', 'answered']",N/A

Dated but shot on a lavish scale in the days when doorstop novels were turned into star-studded epics rather than TV miniseries, it skirts close to guilty pleasure territory without ever providing any unintentional laughs as Anthony Quinn's political prisoner is freed to act as a mediator between the Church and Russia only to find himself elected Pope. Laurence Olivier delivers the bacon as the Russian premier in one of the first of his hammy blockbuster supporting turns he took to supplement his meagre 150 a week salary at the National Theatre, with John Gielgud turning up for one scene as an ailing pontiff while Oskar Werner, Leo McKern and Vittorio De Sica get the more substantial roles. Too much screen time is wasted on David Jansenn and Barbara Jefford's marital problems, an irrelevant subplot that simply gets discarded entirely in the last third, and the political crisis in the background with a starving China threatening world war isn't entirely convincing. Yet there is some substance there even if the politics, both theological and secular, are somewhat confused - how many roadshow pictures feature a philosopher-priest (Werner) under investigation for developing the theories of Teillhard de Chardin? There's even one surprisingly touching scene between Leo McKern and Quinn near the end of the film about loneliness, and Alex North's grandiose score, incorporating as its main theme part of his rejected score for 2001, is quite magnificent. And if you've ever wanted to see Zorba the Pope reciting the Shema Yisrael, this is the movie for you.It's just a shame that the recent DVD runs into synch problems in the last third and that the making-of featurette has been cropped from 1.33:1 to 1.85:1, meaning that the extracts from the film in it are cropped both horizontally and vertically!",4,"Lavish, sincere, not always convincing but still engaging epic",1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,1884,"['Pope', 'go', 'Shoes', 'Fisherman', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'Dated', 'shot', 'lavish', 'scale', 'days', 'when', 'doorstop', 'novels', 'were', 'turned', 'star-studded', 'epics', 'rather', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'close', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'territory', 'ever', 'providing', 'unintentional', 'laughs', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'political', 'prisoner', 'freed', 'act', 'mediator', 'Church', 'Russia', 'only', 'find', 'elected', 'Pope', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'bacon', 'Russian', 'premier', 'one', 'first', 'hammy', 'blockbuster', 'supporting', 'turns', 'took', 'supplement', 'meagre', '150', 'week', 'salary', 'National', 'Theatre', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'turning', 'up', 'one', 'scene', 'ailing', 'pontiff', 'Oskar', 'Werner', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'get', 'more', 'substantial', 'roles', 'Too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'wasted', 'David', 'Jansenn', 'Barbara', 'Jefford', 'marital', 'problems', 'irrelevant', 'subplot', 'simply', 'discarded', 'entirely', 'last', 'third', 'political', 'crisis', 'background', 'starving', 'China', 'threatening', 'world', 'war', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'convincing', 'substance', 'there', 'even', 'politics', 'theological', 'secular', 'are', 'somewhat', 'confused', 'how', 'many', 'roadshow', 'pictures', 'feature', 'philosopher-priest', 'Werner', 'investigation', 'developing', 'theories', 'Teillhard', 'de', 'Chardin', 'even', 'one', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'scene', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'Quinn', 'end', 'film', 'loneliness', 'Alex', 'North', 'grandiose', 'score', 'incorporating', 'main', 'theme', 'part', 'rejected', 'score', '2001', 'quite', 'magnificent', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wanted', 'see', 'Zorba', 'Pope', 'reciting', 'Shema', 'Yisrael', 'movie', 'you.It', 'just', 'shame', 'recent', 'DVD', 'synch', 'problems', 'last', 'third', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'been', 'cropped', '1.33:1', '1.85:1', 'meaning', 'extracts', 'film', 'are', 'cropped', 'horizontally', 'vertically']",N/A

It didn't receive that much acclaim at the time, and there are places in the film where the storyline stalls a little.  What has renewed interest in this movie about the election of a Russian Pope is the fact that it came out just ten years before the election of Pope John-Paul II.  Who could have guessed in 1968 that a bishop from a communist country would be elected the supreme pontiff of the Universal Church?The cast reads like a who's who of the acting world:  Olivier, Quinn, Werner, McKern.  All gave fine perfomances.  Leo McKern and Vittorio DeSica were especially effective as Cardinals of the Church.  And Oscar Werner's performance as the silenced priest was outstanding.The set designs were wonderful, and the scenes inside the Sistine Chapel were especially effective.  Although the conclave is done behind locked doors, the process of the papal election in this film is said to be very accurate.  The drama focuses on how Kiril Lakota, a Russian bishop who has been imprisoned in a labor camp for tweny years, reacts to his freedom and the shock of being selected as the successor of St. Peter.  Anthony Quinn carries off this difficult role very well.  You can see the anguish in his face as he tries to cope with everything that is happening to him in such a short time.
