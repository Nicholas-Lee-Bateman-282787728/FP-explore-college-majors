Last year,Ancient Aliens: Season 5 Volume 1came out on DVD only in 720p standard definition even though it had apparently included ALL 12 episodes of Season 5 that were broadcast.With Season 6 currently being broadcast on H2, it would seem that they are finally releasing a Season 5 Volume 2 (2 as in ""DOUBLE DIP"") but we are at least getting a proper High Definition 1080p Bluray release. But what episodes are we getting exactly here?  The same 12 episodes that were included in Volume 1, as Ancient Astronaut Theorists contend?

Human history has already been determined, beyond much doubt, to be at least twice a old as &#34;traditional&#34; historians once believed.  With our ever changing geography, ice ages, sea levels, volcanoes, etc... it is quite possible, and highly probable, that much of our real ancient history has been lost to time.  Thought provoking and really interesting connections in this series... I really enjoy it.
