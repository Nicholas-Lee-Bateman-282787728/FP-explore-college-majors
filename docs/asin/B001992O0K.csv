1162192,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B001992O0K,JGC,"[22, 23]","""Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye"" is a heart-warming series, based on a true story that your entire family will appreciate. This critically-acclaimed series includes a long list of very talented actors and actresses, and stars Deanne Bray in the title role of Sue Thomas.What first attracted me to this program was its true-to-life concepts and its startling realism. This is also a great show for anyone who enjoys animals because a very cute and bright Golden Retriever is prominently featured in every ep. Perhaps it's no coincidence that the series is in current rotation on Animal Planet (Mondays @ 9PM).Although the series was very successful, it was canceled in 2005. However, viewers like myself have never forgotten about ""Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye"" because rarely has there been another series as beautifully written with such an important message; that it doesn't matter what life gives us, we can all become whatever we choose, if we work hard at it and follow our heart!Deanne Bray is an exceptional actress because she lights up every scene with her charm and chemistry. I also especially enjoyed Enuka Okuma, playing Lucy, Sue's co-worker and close friend. Enuka is also a very successful and talented actress in her own right, longtime fans who grew up watching her on TV remember her best from the series ""Fifteen"".One of my favorite eps was the second-half of the pilot because it was so fast-moving and refreshing in its overall message. Although it was sad to see, it was also so cute seeing Levi laying down in the hospital bed.I recommend this series to anyone who needs a little lift or inspiration because Sue Thomas will surely put a smile on your face!",5,enjoy the golden side of life,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,1660,"['Sue', 'Thomas', 'F.B.Eye', 'heart-warming', 'series', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'entire', 'family', 'will', 'appreciate', 'critically-acclaimed', 'series', 'long', 'list', 'very', 'talented', 'actors', 'actresses', 'stars', 'Deanne', 'Bray', 'title', 'role', 'Sue', 'Thomas.What', 'first', 'attracted', 'program', 'was', 'true-to-life', 'concepts', 'startling', 'realism', 'also', 'great', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'animals', 'very', 'cute', 'bright', 'Golden', 'Retriever', 'prominently', 'featured', 'ep', 'Perhaps', 'coincidence', 'series', 'current', 'rotation', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'Mondays', '@', '9PM', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'successful', 'was', 'canceled', '2005', 'However', 'viewers', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'Sue', 'Thomas', 'F.B.Eye', 'rarely', 'there', 'been', 'series', 'beautifully', 'written', 'important', 'message', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'life', 'can', 'become', 'choose', 'work', 'hard', 'follow', 'heart', 'Deanne', 'Bray', 'exceptional', 'actress', 'up', 'scene', 'charm', 'chemistry', 'also', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Enuka', 'Okuma', 'playing', 'Lucy', 'Sue', 'co-worker', 'close', 'friend', 'Enuka', 'also', 'very', 'successful', 'talented', 'actress', 'own', 'right', 'longtime', 'fans', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'TV', 'remember', 'best', 'series', 'Fifteen', '.One', 'favorite', 'eps', 'was', 'second-half', 'pilot', 'was', 'so', 'fast-moving', 'refreshing', 'overall', 'message', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'was', 'also', 'so', 'cute', 'seeing', 'Levi', 'laying', 'down', 'hospital', 'bed.I', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'little', 'lift', 'inspiration', 'Sue', 'Thomas', 'will', 'surely', 'put', 'smile', 'face']",Sue Thomas F.B.Eye Collection Volumes 1-5

1162197,A1UGBHFRUDNYD1,B001992O0K,"Nenah Sylver ""Nenah Sylver, PhD, author""","[7, 16]","This is a highly unusual series, based on the true story of real life FBI agent Sue Thomas. The still-living Thomas, who was deaf from a very young age, was hired by the FBI when she was in her early 20s because of her remarkable ability to read lips and transcribe the dialogue on visual surveillance equipment that lacked sound. Thomas's ability to read lips accurately made her quite an asset to the agency as she helped solve cases. This series is a fictionalized account of a few years that she spent with the FBI.Where to start? First, the good. Deanne Bray--in real life, almost completely deaf herself--is a phenomenal actress. Highly expressive and luminous, she comes across as real, and a nice person to boot. One can't help but fall in love with her as she not only uses her lip-reading ability, but also connects to others--from co-workers to the criminals--on a deeply truthful, direct, heartfelt level. If you see Bray speak in real life (check the 'net), you can see tremendous depth shining forth.Unlike most other crime programs, this series spares us the excessive gory, bloody violence in scenes that would make one want to avert their eyes. However, Sue Thomas, F.B.Eye is still high in tension. The swat and capture scenes are filmed jerkily with a hand-held camera. And the few times that Sue herself is kidnapped are unnerving. Particularly poignant is the time that Sue is blindfolded and begs, ""Please, take off the blindfold, my eyes are everything to me!"" Yes, her eyes ARE everything to her. And you, the viewer, are right there in her world as you realize how hard this deaf woman must work to compensate for the loss of one of her senses.Remarkably, Bray's speech is practically crystal clear. Aside from the fact that she needs to see you in order to know what you're saying, the only hint that she's deaf is what sounds somewhat like a very slight lisp. But Bray's voice is wonderful in its inflections, tone and timbre. Were the theme of living as a deaf person not such an integral part of the show, one could easily forget that for the most part Bray can't hear. (She has very slight hearing in one ear, but she's legally deaf.)Aside from who the character of Sue Thomas is portrayed to be, one of the most wonderful things that this series offers to hearing viewers is a sense of what it means to be deaf. Sue's roommate and co-workers learn to sign in American Sign Language (ASL), and there are plenty of deaf, signing actors with a lot to say. One striking thing about ASL is its rich visual/metaphorical content. People who sign HAVE to be expressive in order to make themselves understood. This all makes for very interesting, absorbing theater. But being deaf is never a forced issue; it's organic to the plot, the deaf actors are organic to the plot, and learning what it means to live in a silent world is illuminating for me, a hearing viewer. When some of the characters sign, captions appear on the screen so people unversed in ASL know what they are saying. And, of course, there are subtitles so that the hearing impaired can view the show too.It's easy to fall in love with this character. So why only 4 stars? There are some really annoying flaws that detract from the message and from the plot. First, in nearly every episode the Thomas character talks about God--how God has interceded, how she has faith, how all things work according to a grand plan. This reflects the religiosity of the real Sue Thomas. That's fine--but in any good art, the cardinal rule is ""Show, don't tell."" We, the audience, end up being preached to, and after a while it gets very tiresome. If the amount of time devoted to discussing God could have been reduced to one-quarter or one-fifth of what it is, and referenced more subtly, it would not have interfered. Also a bit too Disney-esque and saccharin is the mention of friends, ad nauseum. SHOW, DON'T TELL: actions speak louder than words. The entire cast (both regular and supporting actors) does such a fine job of acting, there's plenty of showing. Unfortunately, it seems as though the writers wanted to make sure that the audience ""got"" the values of love, integrity, family and honesty; so too often the scripts hammer these things at us instead of allowing the acting to carry the message.Another huge turn-off was the presumably good-natured ribbing of one character in particular, FBI agent Myles. He's long-winded and somewhat arrogant, but it became tiresome after a while to hear so much badgering from the co-workers who were actually mean to him, quite unnecessarily. At one point, Lucy pretends that she knows some of Myles's secrets (she doesn't), so she blackmails him into doing her bidding for an unspecified period of time. It's actually shocking to hear her gloat, ""It's great to have a man-servant""--and this reverse sexism from an African-American woman, no less! MAN-SERVANT? True, Myles had treated Lucy badly during an early episode, but why are we doing tit for tat, especially when the message of love and forgiveness suffuses the series? If a criminal can be forgiven, why not a co-worker? Where is the ""God"" in that? Since this series is so uplifting in so many ways otherwise, this noticeably dragged it down.My third gripe relates to the unresolved ending between Sue and fellow FBI agent Jack, who clearly is in love with Sue. Office rules forbid co-workers within the same division from dating, so there is a very strong bond between Jack and Sue that remains platonic and provides some tension throughout. Sue clearly loves Jack too, but during the last episode she allows him to (obliquely) tell her his feelings without revealing how she feels herself. This seemed way out of character, since in every other area Sue is up front. Her refusal to reveal her vulnerability was hugely anti-climactic and didn't sit well. Can you say ""Denial""?To conclude, the biggest flaw is the writing. The series deserves better and the characters deserve better. Keep an eye out for Rick Peters, with his charming Australian accent; and Tara Samuel, with a unique voice, huge eyes and pixie-ish features that remind one of a gentle Meg Ryan. Marc Gomes gives a subtle but good performance, and Troy Kotsur, Deanne Bray's real-life husband, is fantastically expressive as a reformed deaf criminal.This series offers a new meaning to achievement in the face of difficult odds; to being all you can be, even if you're different; and a vastly increased understanding of what it means to be deaf in a hearing world. My household had to purchase these DVDs because they are not available for rental. I'm real glad I bought these DVDs, but I don't know if I could watch them again. The series is so good, its few faults are glaring. If there's ever a reprise, I hope the issues are addressed.",4,"So much good in this, but it has substantial flaws",1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,6791,"['highly', 'unusual', 'series', 'based', 'true',

1162198,ABC8FXLD7W528,B001992O0K,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[3, 3]","Sue Thomas is a deaf woman who can read lips and speak. She's lived a sheltered life for the most part, so when she's accepted for a job with the F.B.I. hours from her hometown, she knows she's embarking on an adventure.Based on a true story, this series is one of the best I have ever seen and is on my top-ten favorites list of all time.  Sue Thomas F.B. Eye  has everything that makes a movie good - a touch of romance, drama, humor, action, and adventure. What's more, the writers and producers managed to pull off this feat without the use of the distasteful Hollywood variety of violence, crass humor, foul language, and sexuality.Sue Thomas F.B. Eye is a wholesome show, but it's far from dull. Each episode includes the latest case to solve by Sue's F.B.I. team, which includes:Sue, a talented lip reader who helps solve many cases, but who struggles with being accepted because of her disability;Jack, the lead investigator (with a dash of romance between he and Sue);Lucy, Sue's best friend and roommate, and the administrative assistant for Sue's F.B.I. team;Bobby, the Australian agent with a flair for fighting for the underdog;Tara, who can figure out just about anything on the computer and is the technology guru of the group;Demetrius, the serious, yet kind, agent who learns a lesson the hard way about how his workaholic tendencies affect his family; andMiles, the annoying know-it-all who has it out for Sue in the beginning.Some of the episodes include some scary parts that may be inappropriate for those under 10 only because of the theme. There is nothing objectionable in any of the episodes and Sue Thomas F.B.Eye is a perfect series for the entire family. I highly recommend purchasing the entire set. As of this review, there are five seasons, but I'm hoping they'll make more soon!I have originally reviewed and added this movie to my Mom-Approved Movie Listing on my Wordpress blog.",5,On my top-10 favorites list!,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,1912,"['Sue', 'Thomas', 'deaf', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'read', 'lips', 'speak', 'lived', 'sheltered', 'life', 'most', 'part', 'so', 'when', 'accepted', 'job', 'F.B.I', 'hours', 'hometown', 'embarking', 'adventure.Based', 'true', 'story', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'top-ten', 'favorites', 'list', 'time', 'Sue', 'Thomas', 'F.B', 'Eye', 'everything', 'movie', 'good', 'touch', 'romance', 'drama', 'humor', 'action', 'adventure', 'What', 'more', 'writers', 'producers', 'managed', 'pull', 'off', 'feat', 'use', 'distasteful', 'Hollywood', 'variety', 'violence', 'crass', 'humor', 'foul', 'language', 'sexuality.Sue', 'Thomas', 'F.B', 'Eye', 'wholesome', 'show', 'far', 'dull', 'episode', 'latest', 'case', 'solve', 'Sue', 'F.B.I', 'team', 'Sue', 'talented', 'lip', 'reader', 'who', 'solve', 'many', 'cases', 'who', 'being', 'accepted', 'disability', 'Jack', 'lead', 'investigator', 'dash', 'romance', 'Sue', 'Lucy', 'Sue', 'best', 'friend', 'roommate', 'administrative', 'assistant', 'Sue', 'F.B.I', 'team', 'Bobby', 'Australian', 'agent', 'flair', 'fighting', 'underdog', 'Tara', 'who', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'anything', 'computer', 'technology', 'guru', 'group', 'Demetrius', 'serious', 'yet', 'kind', 'agent', 'who', 'lesson', 'hard', 'way', 'how', 'workaholic', 'tendencies', 'affect', 'family', 'andMiles', 'annoying', 'know-it-all', 'who', 'out', 'Sue', 'beginning.Some', 'episodes', 'include', 'scary', 'parts', 'may', 'be', 'inappropriate', '10', 'only', 'theme', 'nothing', 'objectionable', 'episodes', 'Sue', 'Thomas', 'F.B.Eye', 'perfect', 'series', 'entire', 'family', 'highly', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'entire', 'set', 'review', 'are', 'five', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'make', 'more', 'soon', 'have', 'originally', 'reviewed', 'added', 'movie', 'Mom-Approved', 'Movie', 'Listing', 'Wordpress', 'blog']",Sue Thomas F.B.Eye Collection Volumes 1-5

Families if there is nothing on tv, then pop a bag of popcorn,sit on the couch with a blanket, a tissue or two and watch the best tv I have seen in years. I have all 5 volumes on DVD. The writers blend in the right amount of action with the right sense of humor. When the talk about God, they say it in a wonderful way that doesn't take His name in vain.
