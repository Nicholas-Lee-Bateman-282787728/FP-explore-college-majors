1155579,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B00171F66E,Midge,"[8, 8]","The longer Universal waits, the more potential customers who die and the lower the sales. There is NO benefit in delaying DVD production. There are less and less customers with each passing year as we are all dying off. Universal will not gain customers by waiting... they will lose them by attrition. They need to realize their film vault does not gain in value, it loses value with every year they wait. They need to put someone in charge who understands basic arithmetic with basic common sense in running the company. They need to get off their duffs and get the remainder of the DVD's released for the fans while they are still alive to buy them.We also have to wonder what kind of limited mindset canceled this show in the first place? If you had any intelligence at all, you would bring back the show and put it in a decent timeslot of its own where it doesn't have to compete with some other popular program. How many great shows were destroyed by this stupid method of trying to take down the competition instead of standing on their own? Then they ended up with nothing.The problem with the series would have been easy to fix. With a name like ""Amazing Stories"" the viewers were expecting an upbeat family show with fantasy and trick endings with lessons in morals, etc. I remember how it started and what we were all expecting. I also remember why people stopped watching it. The mistake was taking this show into dark stories and downer episodes about war and death and murder for which this generation has no tolerance and certainly not something to show the children. It was those episodes about war and death which turned away the audience. There was also entirely too much smoking on the episodes. I had forgotten some of these things until I recently watched season one again.This series was expected to be a family show with an upbeat fantasy flair which children could watch but creative enough where adults would enjoy it as well. It started off great with the train story. The Sitter story was also perfect for this series as was the boy magnet episode. But those dark episodes should have been sold to twilight zone (which was also showing renewed episodes at the time.) And most of all, no war or death or westerns for the generations who graduated in the 60's & 70's because the majority have no tolerance for watching those subjects and they certainly don't belong on a series named, ""Amazing Stories"". I'm truly surprised that Speilberg allowed those dark stories to be included in the series.Those types dark, adult theme stories should have been relegated to a different series designed around those types of subjects for adult audiences at a later showtime... certainly not for family. I know I did not want my son watching war and death or murder shows at that time. If they would eliminate this type of storyline from this series and stick with the light hearted fantasies, this series could be resurrected with new stories. Again, this could have been an easy fix without canceling the series.One of these days, it won't be up to small minded network or cable channel execs... the viewers will choose what they want to watch direct from the production companies off of the internet and we'll take the execs out of the loop... just the same as the theaters will eventually go away to movies direct into the home. Stupid decisions like canceling hit shows sowed the seeds of the networks' and theaters' eventual demise when they no longer get to make these decisions as the viewers take them out of the loop as they go direct. Then the advertisers will have to find a way to sponsor the shows or gain visibility on the direct episodes or downloads.",5,Customers are dying off,1291075200,"11 30, 2010",2010,3678,"['longer', 'Universal', 'waits', 'more', 'potential', 'customers', 'who', 'die', 'lower', 'sales', 'benefit', 'delaying', 'DVD', 'production', 'are', 'less', 'less', 'customers', 'passing', 'year', 'are', 'dying', 'off', 'Universal', 'will', 'not', 'gain', 'customers', 'waiting', 'will', 'lose', 'attrition', 'need', 'realize', 'film', 'vault', 'not', 'gain', 'value', 'value', 'year', 'wait', 'need', 'put', 'someone', 'charge', 'who', 'basic', 'arithmetic', 'basic', 'common', 'sense', 'running', 'company', 'need', 'get', 'off', 'duffs', 'get', 'remainder', 'DVD', 'released', 'fans', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'buy', 'them.We', 'also', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'kind', 'limited', 'mindset', 'canceled', 'show', 'first', 'place', 'had', 'intelligence', 'would', 'bring', 'back', 'show', 'put', 'decent', 'timeslot', 'own', 'where', ""n't"", 'have', 'compete', 'other', 'popular', 'program', 'How', 'many', 'great', 'shows', 'were', 'destroyed', 'stupid', 'method', 'trying', 'take', 'down', 'competition', 'instead', 'standing', 'own', 'Then', 'ended', 'up', 'nothing.The', 'problem', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'fix', 'name', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'viewers', 'were', 'expecting', 'upbeat', 'family', 'show', 'fantasy', 'trick', 'endings', 'lessons', 'morals', 'etc', 'remember', 'how', 'started', 'what', 'were', 'expecting', 'also', 'remember', 'why', 'people', 'stopped', 'watching', 'mistake', 'was', 'taking', 'show', 'dark', 'stories', 'downer', 'episodes', 'war', 'death', 'murder', 'generation', 'tolerance', 'certainly', 'not', 'something', 'show', 'children', 'was', 'episodes', 'war', 'death', 'turned', 'away', 'audience', 'was', 'also', 'entirely', 'too', 'much', 'smoking', 'episodes', 'had', 'forgotten', 'things', 'recently', 'watched', 'season', 'one', 'again.This', 'series', 'was', 'expected', 'be', 'family', 'show', 'upbeat', 'fantasy', 'flair', 'children', 'could', 'watch', 'creative', 'enough', 'where', 'adults', 'would', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'started', 'off', 'great', 'train', 'story', 'Sitter', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'perfect', 'series', 'was', 'boy', 'magnet', 'episode', 'dark', 'episodes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'sold', 'twilight', 'zone', 'was', 'also', 'showing', 'renewed', 'episodes', 'time', 'most', 'war', 'death', 'westerns', 'generations', 'who', 'graduated', '60', '70', 'majority', 'have', 'tolerance', 'watching', 'subjects', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'series', 'named', 'Amazing', 'Stories', ""'m"", 'truly', 'surprised', 'Speilberg', 'allowed', 'dark', 'stories', 'be', 'included', 'series.Those', 'types', 'dark', 'adult', 'theme', 'stories', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'relegated', 'different', 'series', 'designed', 'types', 'subjects', 'adult', 'audiences', 'later', 'showtime', 'certainly', 'not', 'family', 'know', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'son', 'watching', 'war', 'death', 'murder', 'shows', 'time', 'would', 'eliminate', 'type', 'storyline', 'series', 'stick', 'light', 'hearted', 'fantasies', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'resurrected', 'new', 'stories', 'Again', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'fix', 'canceling', 'series.One', 'days', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'up', 'small', 'minded', 'network', 'cable', 'channel', 'execs', 'viewers', 'will', 'choose', 'what', 'want', 'watch', 'direct', 'production', 'companies', 'internet', ""'ll"", 'take', 'execs', 'loop', 'just', 'same', 'theaters', 'will', 'eventually', 'go', 'away', 'movies', 'direct', 'home', 'Stupid', 'decisions', 'canceling', 'hit', 'shows', 'sowed', 'seeds', 'networks', 'theaters', 'eventual', 'demise', 'when', 'no', 'longer', 'get', 'make', 'decisions', 'viewers', 'take', 'loop', 'go', 'direct', 'Then', 'advertisers', 'will', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'sponsor', 'shows', 'gain', 'visibility', 'direct', 'episodes', 'downloads']",Amazing Stories: Season 2
