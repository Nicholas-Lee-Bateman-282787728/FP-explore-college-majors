776986,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0000D1FHX,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","I can't help but think Frozen Alive was a bit disappointing to me.Basically, the entire plot in the second half of the film builds around one man being froze for a scientific experiment.What's the first half of the movie about?  Well, not about anything really interesting or scary, that's for sure.  It's about one mans wife who apparently has a severe drinking problem, acting psychotic and extremely jealous of the woman her husband works with.  Eventually this all results in her bringing a gun to the workplace and almost threatening to use it.The gun eventually gets used, but the thing is- why should I care about that?  I didn't watch this movie to see some kind of detective story.  I watched Frozen Alive to get creepy feelings about a man who freezes himself as part of an experiment, and I was totally disappointed the first half of the movie did nothing to build up to that.  Really, when I say nothing, I mean NOTHING at all.  It was just about a man's crazy wife staggering around with her drinking problem and her cheating ways (she wasn't sure which man she wanted to be with).Very disappointed in all that stuff.  However, I can't deny the story DID keep me interested, even though it wasn't what I was expecting it to be.  As an older film, it's fun to watch, but wasn't scary by any stretch of the imagination.  Not even the slightest bit creepy for that matter.",3,it kept me interested... for the wrong reasons,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,1382,"['ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Frozen', 'Alive', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'me.Basically', 'entire', 'plot', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'one', 'man', 'being', 'froze', 'scientific', 'experiment.What', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'Well', 'not', 'anything', 'really', 'interesting', 'scary', 'sure', 'one', 'mans', 'wife', 'who', 'apparently', 'severe', 'drinking', 'problem', 'acting', 'psychotic', 'extremely', 'jealous', 'woman', 'husband', 'Eventually', 'results', 'bringing', 'gun', 'workplace', 'almost', 'threatening', 'use', 'it.The', 'gun', 'eventually', 'used', 'thing', 'is-', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'kind', 'detective', 'story', 'watched', 'Frozen', 'Alive', 'get', 'creepy', 'feelings', 'man', 'who', 'part', 'experiment', 'was', 'totally', 'disappointed', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'did', 'nothing', 'build', 'up', 'Really', 'when', 'say', 'nothing', 'mean', 'NOTHING', 'was', 'just', 'man', 'crazy', 'wife', 'staggering', 'around', 'drinking', 'problem', 'cheating', 'ways', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'man', 'wanted', 'be', '.Very', 'disappointed', 'stuff', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'story', 'DID', 'keep', 'interested', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'older', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'Not', 'even', 'slightest', 'bit', 'creepy', 'matter']",Frozen Alive

The set up is decent, w/ scientists doing their work in the lab while, unbeknownst to them, a drunken / jealous wife gets closer and closer to doing something disastrously stupid. Unfortunately, this movie suffers from it's own long-winded telling of this tale. If it had been about 30 min. shorter, it would have made a great Twilight Zone episode!

776989,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0000D1FHX,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","This isn't what I would call a riveting science fiction thriller.  Sometimes it seems that the film itself is in suspended animation, as it takes forever to get to the real science fiction part of the whole story - namely, the freezing and unfreezing of a human being.Dr. Frank Overton (Mark Stevens) and Dr. Helen Wieland (Marianne Koch) are pioneers in the art of cryogenic freezing.  They've already managed to put monkeys in suspended animation and bring them back with no ill effects.  The natural next step for them is the freezing of a human being - but, as you can imagine, not everyone is thrilled with that proposition, including the guy holding the money strings.  Dr. Overton ultimately decides that the experiment must be done before the request is officially denied - and he offers up himself as the guinea pig.  The backdrop to all of this is a sort of love triangle involving Helen, Frank, and Joan, Frank's complete lush of a wife.  Actually, let's make it a square because Joan has something going on with another guy, too.  Now, Frank and Helen are just colleagues (although Helen is a little sweet on the guy), but Joan is jealous.  She gets drunk, gets her hands on a gun, and - well, she dies.  It looks like murder, so the police are anxious to talk to her husband - but by then he's snoozing at about 80 degrees below freezing.  There's a nice little moral dilemma for Helen at the very end, which makes the ending a little more interesting than I expected.  Notice I said interesting, not exciting or particularly entertaining.The main problem with this science fiction film is the fact that it really doesn't look or feel like a science fiction film until the very end.  There's just way too much of Joan's philandering and drunken antics and not enough of machines that go ping.",3,Not much reason to take this one out of the freezer,1132099200,"11 16, 2005",2005,1805,"[""n't"", 'what', 'would', 'call', 'riveting', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'film', 'suspended', 'animation', 'forever', 'get', 'real', 'science', 'fiction', 'part', 'whole', 'story', 'namely', 'freezing', 'unfreezing', 'human', 'being.Dr', 'Frank', 'Overton', 'Mark', 'Stevens', 'Dr.', 'Helen', 'Wieland', 'Marianne', 'Koch', 'are', 'pioneers', 'art', 'cryogenic', 'freezing', ""'ve"", 'already', 'managed', 'put', 'monkeys', 'suspended', 'animation', 'bring', 'back', 'ill', 'effects', 'natural', 'next', 'step', 'freezing', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'imagine', 'not', 'everyone', 'thrilled', 'proposition', 'including', 'guy', 'holding', 'money', 'strings', 'Dr.', 'Overton', 'ultimately', 'experiment', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'request', 'officially', 'denied', 'up', 'guinea', 'pig', 'backdrop', 'sort', 'love', 'triangle', 'involving', 'Helen', 'Frank', 'Joan', 'Frank', 'complete', 'lush', 'wife', 'Actually', 'let', 'make', 'square', 'Joan', 'something', 'going', 'guy', 'too', 'Now', 'Frank', 'Helen', 'are', 'just', 'colleagues', 'Helen', 'little', 'sweet', 'guy', 'Joan', 'jealous', 'drunk', 'hands', 'gun', 'well', 'murder', 'police', 'are', 'anxious', 'talk', 'husband', 'then', 'snoozing', '80', 'degrees', 'freezing', 'nice', 'little', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'Helen', 'very', 'end', 'ending', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'expected', 'Notice', 'said', 'interesting', 'not', 'exciting', 'particularly', 'entertaining.The', 'main', 'problem', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'fact', 'really', ""n't"", 'look', 'feel', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'very', 'end', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Joan', 'philandering', 'drunken', 'antics', 'not', 'enough', 'machines', 'go', 'ping']",Frozen Alive

However, it has its merits, namely: the basic idea of the story - which I will not give up here - works pretty well. The main actors handle their roles OK. For anyone interested in spaghetti westerns it's nice to see Marianne Koch of The Fistful of Dollars fame in another movie made in the same year as Leone's groundbreaking first western film. Koch is quite good here, in a speaking role - with Leone's film she only had her good looks, as there were hardly any lines to speak for her as Marisol. Veteran actor Mark Stevens does his job very professionally, too. The story would have worked OK as a 30 or 45 minute episode in Alfred Hitchcock Presents TV series. For a feature film it's somewhat too  long,  even though one does see it through without getting bored.",3,"Not so bad - but not too good, either",1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,921,"['today', 'standards', 'as', 'far', 'technical', 'aspects', 'narrative', 'pace', 'are', 'considered', 'Frozen', 'Alive', 'quite', 'mediocre', 'definitely', 'very', 'much', 'B', 'movie', 'However', 'merits', 'namely', 'basic', 'idea', 'story', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'here', 'pretty', 'well', 'main', 'actors', 'handle', 'roles', 'OK.', 'anyone', 'interested', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'nice', 'see', 'Marianne', 'Koch', 'Fistful', 'Dollars', 'fame', 'movie', 'made', 'same', 'year', 'Leone', 'groundbreaking', 'first', 'western', 'film', 'Koch', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'speaking', 'role', 'Leone', 'film', 'only', 'had', 'good', 'looks', 'were', 'hardly', 'lines', 'speak', 'Marisol', 'Veteran', 'actor', 'Mark', 'Stevens', 'job', 'very', 'professionally', 'too', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'OK', '30', '45', 'minute', 'episode', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Presents', 'TV', 'series', 'feature', 'film', 'somewhat', 'too', 'long', 'even', 'one', 'see', 'getting', 'bored']",Frozen Alive
