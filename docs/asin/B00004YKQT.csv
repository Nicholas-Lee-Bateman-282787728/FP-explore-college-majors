After a successful 598 performance run, it closed on 2/20/68. Opening night cast featured Lou Jacobi, Kay Medford and Anthony Holland. (Medford was later replaced by Peggy Cass.)A so-so1969 film adaptationstarred Jackie Gleason, Estelle Parsons and Ted Bessell.This TV movie is marginally better, has a good music track but is thoroughly unfunny. Allen and Kavner endlessly annoy as whiny tourists trapped at the US embassy in Moscow. Bialik is plain-looking; not sure why Fox's character is attracted to her. For Woody completists only.(Narrator Herlihy voiced movie newsreels for many years.).Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(6.2) Don't Drink the Water (TV-1994) - Michael J.

559246,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00004YKQT,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[9, 14]","`Don't Drink the Water', directed by Woody Allen and based on a Broadway play by Allen is distinctly different from most of his other films due to its dated and just ordinarily funny plot and jokes.As amazing as it may be to say this, almost all of Allen's movies hold up extremely well over time. There seem to be no serious dependencies on the events of the day. Even Zellig, which takes place in a definite time in history, stands up as well as, for example, `Casablanca' or `The Godfather' based on the durability of the story. The movie under consideration, however, depends a lot on early cold war situations as they may have played out in an American embassy in Prague, Budapest, or Warsaw in the early sixties. Much of the background depends on the pre-Cuban Missile Crisis Kennedy administration. Even the title pictures Eastern Europe as not much more advanced in public sanitation as a Banana Republic, let alone our favorite target of such jokes, Mexico.I believe this movie, which may have been made for television, was filmed relatively recently, probably after Michael J. Fox left `Family Ties' and while or before he began his last TV series before retiring due to Parkinson's Disease. I have strong suspicions, however, that the play was written in the early sixties, not too long after the time in which the play takes place.One result of this being an adaptation from a stage play is that there is little or none of Allen's visual humor. All on screen business is written to be done on a stage with one scene on stage at a time. There are also practically none of Allen's favorite topics and plot tricks. This is nothing more than a stage comedy, and virtually none of Allen's other movies are `nothing more than stage comedies'.That does not mean this is not funny. Allen is as good a joke writer as he ever was. It's just that the movie doesn't engage our interest. Compared to, for example, two average Allen movies, `Shadows and Fog' and `A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy', the characters simply don't sustain our interest. This may be due in part to weaker acting by Fox, Kavner, DeLuise, and Herrmann, when compared to Mia Farrow, John Malkovich, Jose Ferrer, and Tony Roberts, but I don't think so, as the principle's are pretty well cast into parts for which they are eminently suited. Julie Kavner, for example, plays almost exactly the same role as she does in the excellent `Radio Days'.Even the plot resolution and the minor love interest are predictable.So, while I am a great Woody Allen fan, I suggest this is one of the very few of his works you can pass up without feeling any sense of loss. It is enjoyable to watch once, but it has little staying power.",3,A very surprisingly average comedy.,1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,2689,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Drink', 'Water', 'directed', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'based', 'Broadway', 'play', 'Allen', 'distinctly', 'different', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'due', 'dated', 'just', 'ordinarily', 'funny', 'plot', 'jokes.As', 'amazing', 'may', 'be', 'say', 'almost', 'Allen', 'movies', 'hold', 'up', 'extremely', 'well', 'time', 'seem', 'be', 'serious', 'dependencies', 'events', 'day', 'Even', 'Zellig', 'place', 'definite', 'time', 'history', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'example', 'Casablanca', 'Godfather', 'based', 'durability', 'story', 'movie', 'consideration', 'however', 'lot', 'early', 'cold', 'war', 'situations', 'may', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'American', 'embassy', 'Prague', 'Budapest', 'Warsaw', 'early', 'sixties', 'Much', 'background', 'pre-Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'Kennedy', 'administration', 'Even', 'title', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'advanced', 'public', 'sanitation', 'Banana', 'Republic', 'let', 'alone', 'favorite', 'target', 'such', 'jokes', 'Mexico.I', 'believe', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'television', 'was', 'filmed', 'relatively', 'recently', 'probably', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'left', 'Family', 'Ties', 'began', 'last', 'TV', 'series', 'retiring', 'due', 'Parkinson', 'Disease', 'have', 'strong', 'suspicions', 'however', 'play', 'was', 'written', 'early', 'sixties', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'time', 'play', 'place.One', 'result', 'being', 'adaptation', 'stage', 'play', 'little', 'none', 'Allen', 'visual', 'humor', 'screen', 'business', 'written', 'be', 'done', 'stage', 'one', 'scene', 'stage', 'time', 'are', 'also', 'practically', 'none', 'Allen', 'favorite', 'topics', 'plot', 'tricks', 'nothing', 'more', 'stage', 'comedy', 'virtually', 'none', 'Allen', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'stage', ""comedies'.That"", 'not', 'mean', 'not', 'funny', 'Allen', 'as', 'good', 'joke', 'writer', 'ever', 'was', 'just', 'movie', ""n't"", 'engage', 'interest', 'Compared', 'example', 'two', 'average', 'Allen', 'movies', 'Shadows', 'Fog', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Sex', 'Comedy', 'characters', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'sustain', 'interest', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'part', 'weaker', 'acting', 'Fox', 'Kavner', 'DeLuise', 'Herrmann', 'when', 'compared', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'principle', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'cast', 'parts', 'are', 'eminently', 'suited', 'Julie', 'Kavner', 'example', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'role', 'excellent', 'Radio', ""Days'.Even"", 'plot', 'resolution', 'minor', 'love', 'interest', 'are', 'predictable.So', 'am', 'great', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fan', 'suggest', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'works', 'can', 'pass', 'up', 'feeling', 'sense', 'loss', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'once', 'little', 'staying', 'power']",Don't Drink the Water VHS

559248,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00004YKQT,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 6]","This 1994 TV movie released to video in late 2000 tells an inane tale of a Jewish American family that, while vacationing in Russia, is mistaken for a ring of spies during the height of the cold war in the 1960's.  This is the story of their exploits as they are holed up in the American Embassy waiting for their chance to return to the U.S.The story was written and directed by Woody Allen, who is one of the most accomplished auteurs in the history of film.  It is clear that Allen purposely dumbed this screenplay down for TV.  Instead of his trademark cerebral humor that cuts like a scalpel, he uses a machine gun approach, hitting the viewer with a fusillade of lowbrow jokes and slapstick gags.  The humor ranges from insipid silliness to standard sitcom fare with occasional intellectual ironies thrown in for his devoted fans.  Though most of it is infantile, the sheer volume of material (literally five to ten jokes and gags a minute) insures that something will tickle you every couple of minutes.The cast is rich with accomplished comedic talent.  Michael J. Fox plays the son of an ambassador who is a hapless diplomat in training.  His frenetic and tortured style of comedy is perfect for this role.  Dom DeLuise adds his wacky brand of humor as a priest who has been in hiding in the embassy for six years and is trying to learn to be an amateur magician.  For him, the extra inhabitants of the embassy represent a captive audience on whom he can inflict one botched magic trick after another.  Julie Kavner brings her whiny New York accent and her wonderful sense of sarcastic timing to play off Woody Allen's inimitably overwrought caricature of himself.  Kavner is a refreshing change for Allen.  We are used to seeing him across from flaky wimps played by Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow.  The use of the bluntly badgering Kavner added significant energy to his performance.  The cast is rounded out by Mayim Bialik (TV's, Blossom) who was decent, but not great as the Jewish American Princess in captivity.Overall, this was a good comedy that was significantly below Woody Allen's standard.  There are plenty of funny lines, but it is a much too farcical.  I rated it a 6/10.  If you enjoy Woody Allen's normal introspective and intellectual humor, this might be a disappointment.",3,Woody Allen for the masses,975801600,"12 3, 2000",2000,2298,"['1994', 'TV', 'movie', 'released', 'video', 'late', '2000', 'inane', 'tale', 'Jewish', 'American', 'family', 'vacationing', 'Russia', 'mistaken', 'ring', 'spies', 'height', 'cold', 'war', '1960', 'story', 'exploits', 'are', 'holed', 'up', 'American', 'Embassy', 'waiting', 'chance', 'return', 'U.S.The', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'accomplished', 'auteurs', 'history', 'film', 'clear', 'Allen', 'purposely', 'dumbed', 'screenplay', 'down', 'TV', 'Instead', 'trademark', 'cerebral', 'humor', 'scalpel', 'machine', 'gun', 'approach', 'hitting', 'viewer', 'fusillade', 'lowbrow', 'jokes', 'slapstick', 'gags', 'humor', 'insipid', 'silliness', 'standard', 'sitcom', 'fare', 'occasional', 'intellectual', 'ironies', 'thrown', 'devoted', 'fans', 'most', 'infantile', 'sheer', 'volume', 'material', 'literally', 'five', 'ten', 'jokes', 'gags', 'minute', 'something', 'will', 'tickle', 'couple', 'minutes.The', 'cast', 'rich', 'accomplished', 'comedic', 'talent', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'son', 'ambassador', 'who', 'hapless', 'diplomat', 'training', 'frenetic', 'tortured', 'style', 'comedy', 'perfect', 'role', 'Dom', 'DeLuise', 'wacky', 'brand', 'humor', 'priest', 'who', 'been', 'hiding', 'embassy', 'six', 'years', 'trying', 'learn', 'be', 'amateur', 'magician', 'extra', 'inhabitants', 'embassy', 'represent', 'captive', 'audience', 'whom', 'can', 'inflict', 'one', 'botched', 'magic', 'trick', 'Julie', 'Kavner', 'whiny', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'sarcastic', 'timing', 'play', 'off', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'inimitably', 'overwrought', 'caricature', 'Kavner', 'refreshing', 'change', 'Allen', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'flaky', 'wimps', 'played', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'use', 'bluntly', 'badgering', 'Kavner', 'added', 'significant', 'energy', 'performance', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'Mayim', 'Bialik', 'TV', 'Blossom', 'who', 'was', 'decent', 'not', 'great', 'Jewish', 'American', 'Princess', 'captivity.Overall', 'was', 'good', 'comedy', 'was', 'significantly', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'standard', 'are', 'plenty', 'funny', 'lines', 'much', 'too', 'farcical', 'rated', '6/10', 'enjoy', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'normal', 'introspective', 'intellectual', 'humor', 'might', 'be', 'disappointment']",Don't Drink the Water VHS
