913090,ABGAL4ZQ7ZG0Z,B0009UC80Q,Adelaidian,"[1, 1]","I hadn't seen this show in probably 25 years or more, so it was great to watch it again. The stories are short and sharp and seeing some of the late '60s L.A. streets is great. The picture colour and packaging are also great but buyer beware regarding disc quality. I bought my Region 1 set many months ago without reading some of the Amazon reviews. I only recently got around to watching the last couple of episodes on disc 1, side A and experienced some serious picture freezing.I gave the disc a clean and it didn't make a difference. I then played it on the home computer DVD player and it was OK. If you have the right PC software then you may also be able to make a back-up copy of the disc for playback on your regular DVD player. After all this, I then found that the original Universal disc played OK on my regular DVD player. Who knows why? If I have any future problems with other discs in this set, I will downgrade my review to below 3 stars.So far, this has been the only problem I have experienced with Universal's Region 1 double sided DVDs (I've bought a few but not viewed all of them fully). For Australian viewers, Adam 12 has never had a Region 4 release, so a Region 1 purchase is the only option.Fortunately, all of Universal's Region 4 TV releases are on single sided discs and they usually include the original Universal MCA-TV closing title. The down side is that many of the one hour programs with a Region 4 release (Columbo, Kojak, Hardy Boys Nancy Drew Mysteries, Magnum P.I., A-Team, Quantum Leap, Northern Exposure, Law & Order franchise, just to name a few) contain episodes that are approximately two minutes shorter than the Region 1 releases and sitcoms such as The Munsters are about one minute shorter. I should add that Universal is not the only major studio that regularly edits its Region 4 releases. Some of the other studios also edit their dramas by up to two minutes per episode and sitcoms by up to one minute. Trying to identify which shows have been edited can be difficult since the approximate running times printed on DVD covers are not always correct.If you're planning on purchasing some uncut Region 1 releases, do have a careful read of the Amazon reviews to weigh up the pros and cons of having uncut episodes on double sided discs.Note added December 2008: I've since found that some region 4 releases are shorter not because they have scenes deleted but because they play at a slightly faster speed (something to do with transfer to PAL format) - although you probably won't notice it in the voices or actions.",3,Great show but poor disc quality,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,2569,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'probably', '25', 'years', 'more', 'was', 'great', 'watch', 'again', 'stories', 'are', 'short', 'sharp', 'seeing', 'late', ""'60s"", 'L.A.', 'streets', 'great', 'picture', 'colour', 'packaging', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'buyer', 'beware', 'regarding', 'disc', 'quality', 'bought', 'Region', '1', 'set', 'many', 'months', 'ago', 'reading', 'Amazon', 'only', 'recently', 'got', 'watching', 'last', 'couple', 'episodes', 'disc', '1', 'side', 'A', 'experienced', 'serious', 'picture', 'freezing.I', 'gave', 'disc', 'clean', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'difference', 'then', 'played', 'home', 'computer', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'OK', 'have', 'right', 'PC', 'software', 'then', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'back-up', 'copy', 'disc', 'playback', 'regular', 'DVD', 'player', 'then', 'found', 'original', 'Universal', 'disc', 'played', 'OK', 'regular', 'DVD', 'player', 'Who', 'why', 'have', 'future', 'problems', 'other', 'discs', 'set', 'will', 'downgrade', 'review', '3', 'stars.So', 'far', 'been', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'experienced', 'Universal', 'Region', '1', 'double', 'sided', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'few', 'not', 'viewed', 'fully', 'Australian', 'viewers', 'Adam', '12', 'never', 'had', 'Region', '4', 'release', 'Region', '1', 'purchase', 'only', 'option.Fortunately', 'Universal', 'Region', '4', 'TV', 'releases', 'are', 'single', 'sided', 'discs', 'usually', 'include', 'original', 'Universal', 'MCA-TV', 'closing', 'title', 'down', 'side', 'many', 'one', 'hour', 'programs', 'Region', '4', 'release', 'Columbo', 'Kojak', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Mysteries', 'Magnum', 'P.I.', 'A-Team', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'Law', 'Order', 'franchise', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'contain', 'episodes', 'are', 'approximately', 'two', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'Region', '1', 'releases', 'sitcoms', 'such', 'Munsters', 'are', 'one', 'minute', 'shorter', 'should', 'add', 'Universal', 'not', 'only', 'major', 'studio', 'regularly', 'Region', '4', 'releases', 'other', 'studios', 'also', 'edit', 'dramas', 'two', 'minutes', 'episode', 'sitcoms', 'one', 'minute', 'Trying', 'identify', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'approximate', 'running', 'times', 'printed', 'DVD', 'covers', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'correct.If', ""'re"", 'planning', 'purchasing', 'uncut', 'Region', '1', 'releases', 'do', 'have', 'careful', 'read', 'Amazon', 'weigh', 'up', 'pros', 'cons', 'having', 'uncut', 'episodes', 'double', 'sided', 'discs.Note', 'added', 'December', '2008', ""'ve"", 'found', 'region', '4', 'releases', 'are', 'shorter', 'not', 'have', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'play', 'slightly', 'faster', 'speed', 'something', 'do', 'transfer', 'PAL', 'format', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'voices', 'actions']",Adam-12: Season One

Sadly  the set I bought on the 26 May 2006 is suffering freezes and in some case whole episodes not playing.The strange thing is, that if I repeatedly clean the disk with a cleaning cloth I CAN get the episode to play. For example the first episode I had problems with (5th episode, disk one, side A) originally froze at 13 minutes, but by repeatedly cleaning it I was able to get it to play OK until 15 minutes, then 17 minutes, 21 minutes, then all the way to the ending credits.It has me totally baffled. Why would repeated cleaning of an apparently undamaged disk  enable it to play through ? AND, why are SOME episodes on the same side playing OK ?It's a great pity that Universal have not fixed the problems.

Automatic 5 STARS!Universal Studios, PLEASE do everyone a big favor and do this DVD set right from the onset!  No consumer wants to see the playability issues that were found on the Dragnet 1967 box set.  It will save a whole lot of expensive postage and gasoline by not having to return the set, (3 times for me), to the vendor!1-ADAM-12 CLEAR!Update - 08-10-05Hey, come on folks.  Universal really did missed the bulls eye on Dragnet.  If Emergency and Adam-12 are nicely restored and arranged sensibly, I'll gladly recant my criticisms.  Until then Universal is coming up way short compared to Image Entertainment  and Paramount TV series distributions.BIG, BIG UPDATE: 08.14.09Adam-12: Season Two,Adam 12: Season Three,Adam-12: Season Four&Adam-12: Season Fiveare now out for your enjoyment.  The best news is that Universal is farming out production to SHOUT! Factory, which has IMHO a great track record.

All 2 discs, both dual-sided, would start crapping out about halfway into on each side.  The first 3 or 4 episodes would play fine, but when it's got about that many left it starts to go bad.  I'd try several times to play, but to no avail.Adam-12 Season 1 isn't closed captioned but can be viewed with English subtitles.  Spoken dialogue can be English or Spanish.  I even tried playing a defective episode with speaking Spanish and English subtitles, but no luck.  Once it goes bad, it won't work.It's a shame my set turned out to be defective; it's the first bad one in my growing DVD collection.  Will exchange it, and will keep on exchanging it until I get all the episodes to play right.  We bought the DVDs to enjoy them, not get frustrated in the process.Adam-12 truly is a fine show,  I wish Universal would consider starting over so we can enjoy the entire season and not be let down again.  Will check back with an update once I get the entire season to play right, hopefully in the near future.Update: I went to the store (not Amazon; Adam-12 was purchased elsewhere) to exchange for another copy of it, but they didn't have it in stock and let me exchange it for something else.  Did this several weeks ago but reporting this update so fans hoping to get this set won't be discouraged.  The show itself was great; it's just the discs left something to be desired.

I loved that show.  It's great to see it again on DVD.  The program itself deserves FIVE STARS without question!  (You might be aware that although cutting edge at the time, and supposedly following LAPD regs to the letter, things would be handled far differently in the last 25 years than what is shown from 1968-1969.)  The only reason I gave it 1 star is because the quality of the discs is BAD.  I have now given up trying to get a set that will play without freezing or stopping altogether.  I see that other people have had a similar problem.  I've watched the 2nd season produced by Shout.  These functioned perfectly.  These discs from Universal have a nice transfer, but you will have trouble finding a set that plays without problems.  Still, I love this old show so much that I will just mix and match various season 1 discs in order to be able to play each episode.  It's not Amazon's fault.

Joe Friday on the less successful series DRAGNET co-created and produced ADAM-12 as well (he also directed the pilot episode) and his sensibility--square, old-fashioned, low on frills-- imbues the 26 episodes included in this set of this police drama.Martin Milner stars as Los Angeles police Officer Pete Malloy, a veteran cop whose new partner (following the death of the previous one) is Los Angeles police Officer Jim Reed (Kent McCord), a rookie who's more than a little wet behind the ears and Bill Boyett stars as their superior officer(Sgt. MacDonald).ADAM-12 ran on NBC for 7 years from the Fall of 1968 to the Spring of 1975 and was also a spin-off of DRAGNET and follows them as they make the rounds in their police black & white, dealing with all manner of circumstances, from the mundane (traffic violations, petty domestic disputes, noise complaints) to the monstrous (murder, drugs, child abuse, suicide).Each episode is about 25 minutes long, the episodes chronicle the quotidian vicissitudes of these patrolmen, as opposed to the investigators, forensic experts, lawyers, and such who populate today's cop shows.Whatever the storyline, the tone is fairly tame, with none of the graphic violence common to later cop shows & while the '65 Watts riots had already taken place, Rodney King, the Rampart scandal, and numerous other ugly events were far in the future.Thus ADAM-12 evinces little or none of the now-vast divide (most of it racially based) that exists between the LAPD and much of the community; on this show, the cops are the good guys, without much nuance (which helps explain its popularity with real police officers).That's certainly not all bad; ADAM-12's realism (for its time) and lack of pretension are refreshing, and the show is looser and not nearly as humorless as DRAGNET. The packaging is as basic as the show itself--there are no extras whatsoever, with 2 double-sided discs containing all 26 episodes.Kent McCord, Martin Milner.

913144,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0009UC80Q,trebe,"[2, 2]","Adam-12 is one of those rare programs that are so engrossing, that it seems to zip along and be over before you know it.  The action is nearly continuous, with almost no down time.  Created by Jack Webb (Dragnet) and Robert A. Cinader (Emergency), Adam-12 does have some similarities to Dragnet, as the program also follows the adventures of two police officers on duty.  The episodes are also based on actual cases, where the `names were changed to protect the innocent'.Executive producer Jack Webb's influence is apparent throughout, and although there are many stylistic similarities to Dragnet, Adam-12 wisely avoids some of the clich&eacute;s found in Dragnet.  Also set in Los Angeles, the series features veteran beat officer Pete Malloy (Martin Milner), breaking in new partner and rookie, Jim Reed (Kent McCord).  Two regular guys, with different personalities and personal lives, who are both very likeable, and have good chemistry together.  Malloy is definitely in charge, but Reed is a quick learner, with enthusiasm for the job.  Reed's learning process, also serves as a way to enlighten those viewers who may not be familiar with things like police procedures, law enforcement, and the criminal justice system.  At a time when the image of the police was not the most favorable, Adam-12 holds a pretty steady course, focusing on police work, and mostly avoiding melodrama, moralistic highhandedness, and politics.  The dialog has a style similar to Dragnet, but is less severe, and only occasionally lapses into mechanical woodenness, or dogmatic recitals.Day and night, Reed and Malloy respond to all types of calls, from traffic violations, robberies, domestic cases, and homicides, to a kid with his head stuck in a fence.  Life is mostly routine, occasionally humorous, and sometimes really scary.  The ability to remain emotionally detached, but still being able to care about people, is part of being a good cop.  Mostly `by the book' (to the point of being a little stiff at times), the officers still display flexibility in dealing with the situations that arise.  While also aimed at showing law enforcement in a good light, unlike Dragnet, Adam-12 is much less preachy, without the emotional moralistic outbursts that Joe Friday (Webb) was prone to, resulting in less contrived drama, and a more enjoyable show.  The writing improves over the course of the season, as the rapport between Malloy and Reed grows, and officers find themselves involved in more interesting cases.Since many of the episodes concern routine matters, the ones that deal with the officer's personal lives seem to stand out.  In Log 33, Reed is in shock, after shooting and killing a 16-year old sniper, and his emotions erupt when debriefed.  It takes a lot to get Malloy angry, but hot dogging Officer Wells' (Gary Crosby) reckless behavior causes him to blow his cool.  In Log 172, the officers stop a beautiful woman (Anna Capri) for speeding, and she turns into Malloy's personal stalker, doing her best to hook up with him, even giving him a sports car.  Log 92 is devoted to a single case, where the squabbling of two neighbors who share ownership in a boat, bring Adam-12 to the scene three times in one day, on the fourth visit, a man lies dead.Season One of Adam-12 may be viewed as mundane or pedestrian, by today's standards, as these are not super cops who punch out thugs, bust a drug ring, or engage in a shootout every week.  While the series reflects a certain level of `reality', it is a selective one, where race relations are not an issue, crime is not too violent, and all police are honest, and never abuse their authority, or break the law.  Adam-12 predates the works of author Joseph Wambaug, an ex-LA police officer who also influenced perceptions of the LAPD in the 70's, with his gritty revelations about the men in blue, in books such as The New Centurions and The Blue Knight.  Points of view that Jack Webb, may not have been very interested in presenting.There are twenty six episodes, on two double sided discs, in this release from Universal Studios.  Picture and sound quality is very good, but there could be some playability issues with some of the discs locking up.  Interestingly, whenever the occasion calls for loud music, the same audio track is used.  Episodes are titled as `Logs', are not arranged in numerical order, and are subtitled.  It would have been great to hear from Martin Milner and Kent McCord, and see what they have to say about the series, some forty years later, but there are no bonus materials.  Hopefully this will happen in a future release.",4,patrolling the streets of LA with Adam-12 . . .,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",2009,4607,"['Adam-12', 'one', 'rare', 'programs', 'are', 'so', 'engrossing', 'zip', 'be', 'know', 'action', 'nearly', 'continuous', 'almost', 'down', 'time', 'Created', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'Dragnet', 'Robert', 'A.', 'Cinader', 'Emergency', 'Adam-12', 'have', 'similarities', 'Dragnet', 'program', 'also', 'adventures', 'two', 'police', 'officers', 'duty', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'based', 'actual', 'cases', 'where', 'names', 'were', 'changed', 'protect', ""innocent'.Executive"", 'producer', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'influence', 'apparent', 'are', 'many', 'stylistic', 'similarities', 'Dragnet', 'Adam-12', 'wisely', 'clich', 'eacute', 'found', 'Dragnet', 'Also', 'set', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'series', 'veteran', 'beat', 'officer', 'Pete', 'Malloy', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'breaking', 'new', 'partner', 'rookie', 'Jim', 'Reed', 'Kent', 'McCord', 'Two', 'regular', 'guys', 'different', 'personalities', 'personal', 'lives', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'likeable', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Malloy', 'definitely', 'charge', 'Reed', 'quick', 'learner', 'enthusiasm', 'job', 'Reed', 'learning', 'process', 'also', 'way', 'enlighten', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'things', 'police', 'procedures', 'law', 'enforcement', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'time', 'when', 'image', 'police', 'was', 'not', 'most', 'favorable', 'Adam-12', 'pretty', 'steady', 'course', 'focusing', 'police', 'work', 'mostly', 'avoiding', 'melodrama', 'moralistic', 'highhandedness', 'politics', 'dialog', 'style', 'similar', 'Dragnet', 'less', 'severe', 'only', 'occasionally', 'mechanical', 'woodenness', 'dogmatic', 'recitals.Day', 'night', 'Reed', 'Malloy', 'respond', 'types', 'calls', 'traffic', 'violations', 'robberies', 'domestic', 'cases', 'homicides', 'kid', 'head', 'stuck', 'fence', 'Life', 'mostly', 'routine', 'occasionally', 'humorous', 'sometimes', 'really', 'scary', 'ability', 'remain', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'still', 'being', 'able', 'care', 'people', 'part', 'being', 'good', 'cop', 'Mostly', 'book', 'point', 'being', 'little', 'stiff', 'times', 'officers', 'still', 'display', 'flexibility', 'dealing', 'situations', 'arise', 'also', 'aimed', 'showing', 'law', 'enforcement', 'good', 'light', 'Dragnet', 'Adam-12', 'much', 'less', 'preachy', 'emotional', 'moralistic', 'outbursts', 'Joe', 'Friday', 'Webb', 'was', 'prone', 'resulting', 'less', 'contrived', 'drama', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'show', 'writing', 'improves', 'course', 'season', 'rapport', 'Malloy', 'Reed', 'grows', 'officers', 'find', 'involved', 'more', 'interesting', 'cases.Since', 'many', 'episodes', 'concern', 'routine', 'matters', 'ones', 'deal', 'officer', 'personal', 'lives', 'seem', 'stand', 'out', 'Log', '33', 'Reed', 'shock', 'shooting', 'killing', '16-year', 'old', 'sniper', 'emotions', 'erupt', 'when', 'debriefed', 'lot', 'get', 'Malloy', 'angry', 'hot', 'dogging', 'Officer', 'Wells', 'Gary', 'Crosby', 'reckless', 'behavior', 'causes', 'blow', 'cool', 'Log', '172', 'officers', 'stop', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Anna', 'Capri', 'speeding', 'Malloy', 'personal', 'stalker', 'doing', 'best', 'hook', 'up', 'even', 'giving', 'sports', 'car', 'Log', '92', 'devoted', 'single', 'case', 'where', 'squabbling', 'two', 'neighbors', 'who', 'share', 'ownership', 'boat', 'bring', 'Adam-12', 'scene', 'three', 'times', 'one', 'day', 'fourth', 'visit', 'man', 'One', 'Adam-12', 'may', 'be', 'viewed', 'mundane', 'pedestrian', 'today', 'standards', 'are', 'not', 'super', 'cops', 'who', 'punch', 'out', 'thugs', 'bust', 'drug', 'ring', 'engage', 'shootout', 'week', 'series', 'certain', 'level', 'reality', 'selective', 'one', 'where', 'race', 'relations', 'are', 'not', 'issue', 'crime', 'not', 'too', 'violent', 'police', 'are', 'honest', 'never', 'abuse', 'authority', 'break', 'law', 'Adam-12', 'works', 'author', 'Joseph', 'Wambaug', 'ex-LA', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'also', 'influenced', 'perceptions', 'LAPD', '70', 'gritty', 'revelations', 'men', 'blue', 'books', 'such', 'New', 'Centurions', 'Blue', 'Knight', 'Points', 'view', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interested', 'are', 'twenty', 'six', 'episodes', 'two', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'release', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'playability', 'issues', 'discs', 'locking', 'up', 'Interestingly', 'whenever', 'occasion', 'loud', 'music', 'same', 'audio', 'track', 'used', 'Episodes', 'are', 'titled', 'Logs', 'are', 'not', 'arranged', 'numerical', 'order', 'are', 'subtitled', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'hear', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'Kent', 'McCord', 'see', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'series', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'bonus', 'materials', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'happen', 'future', 'release']",Adam-12: Season One

That's one reason I love this show. The other is that this program was actually filmed on the streets of Los Angeles and uses many actual locations at a time when L.A. was still largely suburban and growing. To see the old shopping centers, coffee shops and old green RTD busses going by is a trip to the past. I am looking forward to buying all of these DVD sets, as well as ""Emergency"". My only concern is that they are being released by Universal Home Video, which has a poor reputation for quality. I bought the boxed sets of Abbott and Costello's movies, and 2 of the 3 boxed sets have contain flaws with freezing, skipping and other problems.

I really want to buy this but was looking to see if the discs have been changed from the doubled sided Universal messes described here by one and all or if this was a special Netflix set-up. I think my question boils down to is: Is this now FOUR one sided discs or 2 two sided discs? Netflix has them as ""Adam-12: Season 1 (4-Disc Series)"" but the store I've seen the box and it says ""Disc One"" and ""Disc Two"" on the two cases. I'm confused.Update: IF you can BELIEVE this I emailed Netflix sometime back, and they said they get these discs special this way (one sided) to avoid any ""problems"". So, I guess it means it's OK, if the public at large have discs that freeze up...?? Just not big companies, very nice. ((I'm still on the edge about this show b/c of this issue, many here seem to have disc freezes, I myself had problems with Remington Steel S2 and Dragnet S1 with double sided freezing. Not lqqking forward to going through that all over again... it is a mess to try and resolve b/c many places will only let you exhange for the SAME ITEM, but when all the items do it, what good does that do?))Like the show. The chemistry is nice plus there's far more humor than the rather dull Dragnet set I got as a gift. LOVED the episode when Reed cracked up the car!!
