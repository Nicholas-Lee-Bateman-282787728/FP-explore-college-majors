Imagine what you would do if you were making a film and discovered the actress you thought was perfect for the lead was MORE than perfect - in a really frightening way!Besides the story-within-the-story concept of this film, I was impressed with the cinematography and grade-A production values of so many of the scenes.

It's true to its title - You Go Nowhere, fast. When you need someone to explain the movie to you - it's a warning sign that the movie is horribly bad. When the director can't explain the movie but only in the obvious general way - ""It's a movie about making a movie about a crime"" you know you're in trouble. This movie relies on the imagination of the viewers to see things that aren't there. Why don't we all just make our own movie and make this director watch it as part of his punishment of putting out trash called art! As for the female lead actor, Shannyn - she obviously had nothing better to do if her agent recommended that she do this film. If her opportunities totally disapper after this film, she can only blame herself. And if you watch this film after reading these reviews, you can only blame youself if it was a waste of time to travel on the road to nowhere.

1436637,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B0051J15ZE,Doug Anderson,"[3, 3]","Pretty much everything that critics (amateur and professional) have said about this movie is true, both the positive and the negative. And yet....this is one of those failures/successes (like The Paperboy) that you do not want to miss. Monte Hellman made a masterpiece back in 1971 called Two-Lane Blacktop which starred two non-actors (James Taylor and Dennis Wilson), and that film established Hellman as one of the most interesting filmmakers of the early 70's but his entire reputation rests on that one effort. He made other films but none received much attention, until Road to Nowhere, a film which many see as a return to form. Be that as it may, this film stands on its own. It doesn't need the Hellman or Two-Lane mythos to seduce you. Its got plenty of seductive power of its own.In a way, Road to Nowhere is a chance for Hellman (or any cinephile in the audience) to examine his or her own relationship to cinema. On the one hand, the film is full of references to favorite films (The Lady Eve, The Seventh Seal, Spirit of the Beehive) and can be read as an homage to cinema and to a life spent in the company of grand illusions and magnificent obsessions, but it can also be read as a deconstruction of the grand illusions and magnificent obessions that drive people to make or spend their lives around art. Formally, the film resembles Altman's The Player in that Road to Nowhere is a story of an industry type who gets caught up in a real-world film noir. But tonally and thematically the film is a closer cousin to Hitchcock's Vertigo and an even closer cousin to David Lynch's Twin Peaks and Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive...films in which players try out alternative identities/realities and live in a kind of nowhere somewhere between fact and fiction. In Road to Nowhere, everyone plays a part in two separate realities (they each play their real-world identity/reality and their cinematic identity/reality). In one of these realities the players do exactly what they did in actual life (and, essentially, play themselves), and in the other reality these same actors play the same parts but as the director imagines them to be. In effect, we are watching two films, one in which the truth is told and one in which it isn't.It must be said that the plot, even when it makes sense (and it does make sense once you figure out the rules of the game) really tests the boundaries of believability (especially when it comes to Laura Graham/Velma Duran and her willingness to reprise her real-life self onscreen). And so I completely understand the one star reviews. But this film is not trying to recruit you based on its believability (Vertigo, after all, was not believable). The film lures you in because it assumes you too will fall in love with the lead actress and follow that obsession no matter where it takes you even it means no longer caring about such mundane things as believability. The fictional director does not at any point care about the real-world crime on which his story is based, he only cares about his story and for him its a love story, and the film he is makiing is his grand illusion, his magnificent obsession, his ecstatic truth (to use one of Herzog's favorite phrases). If you are willing to play along, this film will find a spot on your year-end best of list, if you're not willing to play along, the film will find a spot on your year-end worst of list.I'll be absolutely honest, its the only film I've ever seen that I would feel perfectly justified putting on either or both.Spoiler alert: The casting (and this film makes a big to do about casting) is excellent. But the stand out is Shannyn Sossamon (Lauren Graham/Velma Duran). Velma Duran posing as Lauren Graham is cast to play herself (even though the director doesn't know Lauren Graham is the actual Velma Duran), but just so the director won't catch on she must pretend that it takes her awhile to figure the part out and the greatest pleasure (or one of the many) is watching her slowly become herself.Footnote: For me, the film that was constantly in my mind while watching Road to Nowhere was Lee Daniel's The Paperboy which was also panned and also featured a cast of characters who each followed their own private obsessions (however tenuously bound to the real world and perilous those obsessions may have been). Both are Southern Noirs. Both extraordinary. Both worth seeing more than once. And, yes, both make my best of list for their respective years.",4,One of the Best Films of 2010,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,4473,"['Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'critics', 'amateur', 'professional', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'true', 'positive', 'negative', 'yet', '.this', 'one', 'failures/successes', 'Paperboy', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'miss', 'Monte', 'Hellman', 'made', 'masterpiece', 'back', '1971', 'called', 'Two-Lane', 'Blacktop', 'starred', 'two', 'non-actors', 'James', 'Taylor', 'Dennis', 'Wilson', 'film', 'established', 'Hellman', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'filmmakers', 'early', '70', 'entire', 'reputation', 'rests', 'one', 'effort', 'made', 'other', 'films', 'none', 'received', 'much', 'attention', 'Road', 'Nowhere', 'film', 'many', 'see', 'return', 'form', 'Be', 'may', 'film', 'own', ""n't"", 'need', 'Hellman', 'Two-Lane', 'mythos', 'seduce', 'got', 'plenty', 'seductive', 'power', 'own.In', 'way', 'Road', 'Nowhere', 'chance', 'Hellman', 'cinephile', 'audience', 'examine', 'own', 'relationship', 'cinema', 'one', 'hand', 'film', 'full', 'references', 'favorite', 'films', 'Lady', 'Eve', 'Seventh', 'Seal', 'Spirit', 'Beehive', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'homage', 'cinema', 'life', 'spent', 'company', 'grand', 'illusions', 'magnificent', 'obsessions', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'read', 'deconstruction', 'grand', 'illusions', 'magnificent', 'obessions', 'drive', 'people', 'make', 'spend', 'lives', 'art', 'Formally', 'film', 'Altman', 'Player', 'Road', 'Nowhere', 'story', 'industry', 'type', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'real-world', 'film', 'noir', 'tonally', 'thematically', 'film', 'closer', 'cousin', 'Hitchcock', 'Vertigo', 'even', 'closer', 'cousin', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'films', 'players', 'try', 'out', 'alternative', 'identities/realities', 'live', 'kind', 'nowhere', 'somewhere', 'fact', 'fiction', 'Road', 'Nowhere', 'everyone', 'part', 'two', 'separate', 'realities', 'play', 'real-world', 'identity/reality', 'cinematic', 'identity/reality', 'one', 'realities', 'players', 'do', 'exactly', 'what', 'did', 'actual', 'life', 'essentially', 'play', 'other', 'reality', 'same', 'actors', 'play', 'same', 'parts', 'director', 'be', 'effect', 'are', 'watching', 'two', 'films', 'one', 'truth', 'told', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'plot', 'even', 'when', 'sense', 'make', 'sense', 'figure', 'out', 'rules', 'game', 'really', 'boundaries', 'believability', 'especially', 'when', 'Laura', 'Graham/Velma', 'Duran', 'willingness', 'reprise', 'real-life', 'self', 'onscreen', 'so', 'completely', 'understand', 'one', 'star', 'reviews', 'film', 'not', 'trying', 'recruit', 'based', 'believability', 'Vertigo', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'film', 'too', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'lead', 'actress', 'follow', 'obsession', 'matter', 'where', 'even', 'no', 'longer', 'caring', 'such', 'mundane', 'things', 'believability', 'fictional', 'director', 'not', 'point', 'care', 'real-world', 'crime', 'story', 'based', 'only', 'story', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'makiing', 'grand', 'illusion', 'magnificent', 'obsession', 'ecstatic', 'truth', 'use', 'one', 'Herzog', 'favorite', 'phrases', 'are', 'willing', 'play', 'along', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'spot', 'year-end', 'best', 'list', ""'re"", 'not', 'willing', 'play', 'along', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'spot', 'year-end', 'worst', 'list.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'absolutely', 'honest', 'only', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'would', 'feel', 'perfectly', 'justified', 'putting', 'both.Spoiler', 'alert', 'casting', 'film', 'big', 'do', 'casting', 'excellent', 'stand', 'out', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'Lauren', 'Graham/Velma', 'Duran', 'Velma', 'Duran', 'posing', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'cast', 'play', 'even', 'director', ""n't"", 'know', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'actual', 'Velma', 'Duran', 'just', 'so', 'director', 'wo', ""n't"", 'catch', 'must', 'pretend', 'awhile', 'figure', 'part', 'greatest', 'pleasure', 'one', 'many', 'watching', 'slowly', 'become', 'herself.Footnote', 'film', 'was', 'constantly', 'mind', 'watching', 'Road', 'Nowhere', 'was', 'Lee', 'Daniel', 'Paperboy', 'was', 'also', 'panned', 'also', 'featured', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'followed', 'own', 'private', 'obsessions', 'however', 'tenuously', 'real', 'world', 'perilous', 'obsessions', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'Southern', 'Noirs', 'extraordinary', 'worth', 'seeing', 'more', 'once', 'yes', 'make', 'best', 'list', 'respective', 'years']",N/A

O'Neill ""edwardoneill""","[12, 18]","ROAD TO NOWHERE is one of the best films of the last five years.In an era when studios reiterate franchises and indies wander between mumbling and low-budget high-concept, writer Gaydos and director Hellman chart out an entirely different course. ROAD TO NOWHERE is an art photograph that moves and breathes, an allegory of media today, and a tribute to cinema as we once knew it.The story is simple. A young filmmaker shoots a movie based on a true story, and things go very, very wrong. That is all you need to know.It's a simple enough premise. But upon this premise, the writer and director concoct a marvelous hall of mirrors, a myth of media in our age--an age in which media swallow up reality and belch forth something entirely other.Shot on Canon DSLR's with Nikon prime lenses, ROAD TO NOWHERE is one of the most beautifully shot movies in years. To my eye, no studio confection can match the shimmering muted quality of these images. As a moving photograph, ROAD TO NOWHERE glances at cable TV, great movies of the past, internet video, laptop video production, and every other form of image-currency that zaps around the globe in our postmodern media economy. The narrative is similarly zig-zaggy, though ultimately barebones.ROAD TO NOWHERE is also haunted by movies like VERTIGO and THE LEGEND OF LYLAH CLARE--movies about men lost in the image of a woman, movies about actresses, movies about loving a woman who's dead, movies about making a movie about loving a woman who's both alive and dead at the same time.Shannyn Sossamon, Cliff De Young and Waylon Payne are notable for their wildly different performances of smoldering beauty, narcissistic self-absorption, and submerged rage (respectively).ROAD TO NOWHERE is a quiet movie of sudden noises, loss and resignation, beauty and banality.

The story lacked clarity and believability; it was too fragmented and jumped so much that nausea was beginning to set in; acting had a robotic read-a-line artificiality with an overly staged feel to it; filming largely took place in a few cost saving settings - house, park and roadway; low quality audio and no subtitles made it hard to follow along with the story; there's an inverse relationship between the number of acknowledgements and thank you for assistance credits and the quality of a movie.
