Simon Baker and Dabney Coleman are excellent as the strained attorney father and son team of Fallin & Fallin.  The premise of the drama is unique.Aussie Simon Baker does a fine job in the role the seemingly 'stiff and wooden' Nicholas Fallin.  The viewer soon comes to realize Nicholas is lacking something in his personality that makes him human.  He's a brilliant Richie-Rich corporate law shark, a recovering drug addict, and a felon ordered to serve community service in the most unlikely way:  As an advocate at Children's Legal Services of Pittsburgh where he is to represent the  best interests of children.  In the pilot, his law colleague, Jake Straka, says, ""Leave it to you to find the profit in a non-profit.""  Where as Nick lacks the ability to make a real human connection with adults, he is capable of relating to his child clients.The dual 'have vs. have-not' worlds of Nicholas Fallin are fascinating to watch and often at odds.  The supporting casts in both worlds are excellent. The writing, acting, and casting are also superb.  The chemistry among the cast is highly credible.The series had an arc with Nicholas Fallin which was actually concluded to the satisfaction of its viewers in the final episode, rare for shows of that time.  If you're a fan of Simon Baker, Dabney Coleman, Alan Rosenberg, legal shows, redemption, and/or complex dramatic relationships ...

Of course he gets busted and he gets sentenced to quite a huge amount of hours at children's legal service plus probation and a fine. THroughout the series we see him juggling his two jobs.This legal drama is not so much about legal stuff as it is about the personal growth of a very troubled thirsty-something man, who might have had everything his dad's money could buy, but healthy relationships with his family. He's clearly scared to death by his father's judgement, as much as he craves for his affection and approval. Emotionally, he's not older than most of his clients at LSP and sometimes he behaves like your perfect a..h..e, and your instinct would be of slapping his face.And yet, we gradually see that, behind his mask of arrogance and 'standoffishness' he is caring and shows concern for those around him. He often sounds as if he were on the verge of tears, and he goes the extra mile trying to help the children and adults he has been sentenced to serve. Even though he tries and adds minutes, if not hours, to his sentence log, he does not hesitate to even become foster carer for one of those children, or to go against social services, grandparents, and basically everyone else in order to grant the wishes of another one. All of this while he's constantly told off by basically everyone: his father, his boss at LSP, his boss at another firm, the group leader at the Al-An, his coworkers at LSP....Plots are very interesting, main actors are great, especially Dabney Coleman and Simon Baker, and the views of downtown Pittsburgh are just wonderful.Hope they'll put the other two series on DVD soon.",5,He's not as bad as he think he is.,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,1895,"['Alvin', 'last', 'episode', 'third', 'series', 'Nicholas', 'Fallin', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'think', 'probably', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'be.This', 'story', 'young', 'corporate', 'lawyer', 'who', 'father', 'day', 'coke', 'parties', 'night', 'course', 'busted', 'sentenced', 'quite', 'huge', 'amount', 'hours', 'children', 'legal', 'service', 'probation', 'fine', 'series', 'see', 'juggling', 'two', 'jobs.This', 'legal', 'drama', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'legal', 'stuff', 'personal', 'growth', 'very', 'troubled', 'thirsty-something', 'man', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'everything', 'dad', 'money', 'could', 'buy', 'healthy', 'relationships', 'family', 'clearly', 'scared', 'death', 'father', 'judgement', 'as', 'much', 'affection', 'approval', 'Emotionally', 'not', 'older', 'most', 'clients', 'LSP', 'sometimes', 'perfect', 'a..h..e', 'instinct', 'would', 'be', 'slapping', 'face.And', 'yet', 'gradually', 'see', 'mask', 'arrogance', ""'standoffishness"", 'caring', 'shows', 'concern', 'often', 'were', 'verge', 'tears', 'extra', 'mile', 'trying', 'help', 'children', 'adults', 'been', 'sentenced', 'serve', 'Even', 'minutes', 'not', 'hours', 'sentence', 'log', 'not', 'hesitate', 'even', 'become', 'foster', 'carer', 'one', 'children', 'go', 'social', 'services', 'grandparents', 'basically', 'everyone', 'else', 'order', 'grant', 'wishes', 'one', 'constantly', 'told', 'off', 'basically', 'everyone', 'father', 'boss', 'LSP', 'boss', 'firm', 'group', 'leader', 'Al-An', 'coworkers', 'LSP', '.Plots', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'views', 'downtown', 'Pittsburgh', 'are', 'just', ""'ll"", 'put', 'other', 'two', 'series', 'DVD', 'soon']",N/A

Baker's seens with Dabney Coleman were amazing to watch as he struggled between goodwill legal work and the call of ""the rich firm"" run by his father. Alan Rosenberg was good though the character he played was less rich than his characters in other series (Cybil, L.A. Law, Civil Wars).

With that having been said, I thought this was a terrific series.The most important ingredient of this series' success is the understated (and unfortunately, criminally underrated) performance of Simon Baker. Because of the manner in which he plays Nick Fallon,  you can see how the cumulative strain of:(1) Fallon being sentenced to thousands of hours of community service in most trying, heartbreaking area of family law --destitute, abandoned and defenseless children;(2) while struggling to stay productive at his tough-as-nails father's white-shoe mergers and acqusitions law firm and(3)remaining soberis (incrementally) tearing his character apart.I strongly recommend this series to anyone who is tired of the melodramatic and overwrought nature of other legal dramas.

A natural in front of the camera; he's totally different in every one of his projects.ALL of the actors were amazing in this tough series - an edgy, bottled up, emotionally challenged Nick (Baker) dealing with his world of hurt when his mother dies and a sensitive boy is sent off to endure boarding schools and a cold Professional father (Dabney Coleman at his best) too tied up in a cold harsh business to help his hurting child.  It is fascinating to watch the emotionally fragile walls spin and tumble as characters grow, change and relationships continue to evolve as the black and white efficiency of law starts to turn more gray as the world changes for the characters through their exposure to distraught, fragile children and families.

Things are what they are--the family stories are sad and frightening, and though many of them are left open ended, the viewer knows that the patterns of dysfunction, poverty and abuse will be handed down generationally in most cases.The son and father interaction as well as the story lines involving corporate deals were interesting, though not as interesting as the children and their backstories. The one thing that takes away from the series is Nick's love interest, played by Wendy Monitz, who is perpetually confused about her attraction to Nick and marries a man she doesn't love instead --- highly contrived  in order to build sexual tension and begins to drag  after a while.Wonderful performances all around  [some of the guest stars playing corporate raiders and CFO's are as outstanding as they are disturbing] and particularly by regulars Kathleen Chafant as Laurie Stolt, a mature and dedicated social worker who has seen it all and yet still can make terrible errors in judgment; Rafael Sbarge as a callow corporate attorney [ the episode where he withdraws charges against a neglectful young mother he's been sleeping with is chilling]; and Farrah Fawcett who plays a winsome grandmother who still dresses inappropriately and becomes involved with Nick's father for a time.It's my understanding that the creator of the program based the scripts  on the experiences of his brother who works within the  child welfare system.

He's heading for a breakdown and the suspense keeps one on the edge of his or her seat.  Questions also arise:  how did Nick Fallon get this way?  Why do he and his father work together, but don't seem to get along personally?  Is Fallon still abusing drugs?For fans of the series this release signifies a sigh of relief as the wait for this set has been long.

The acting by all participants is first rate, it is well- written and fast-paced, and the stories are rich and emotionally challenging. I loved the way Simon Baker played his character...he makes a very convincing lawyer because he tries to remain emotionally detached and apply all his powers to achieving results for his clients, especially his children clients who find themselves in dire circumstances. This show is both touching and clever and it successfully achieves these things because Baker underplays his role. Just as a very good lawyer does his job dispassionately in the real world to retain his edge and remain effective, Baker gives us a very accurate portrayal of what it is to be a good lawyer in today's world.

While vulnerable & partly introverted, he was forced to deal with real life issues on the high-side of corporate law in his father's firm, while trying to gain acceptance among his peers & juggling his volunteer hours as a juvenile defender at the City's free law clinic. I loved the relationship between he & his father and he & his &#34;friend,&#34; Lulu.  The show's contrasting mix of tough court decisions regarding the care & placement of at-risk-kids & their defective and/or dysfunctional parents/guardians was an awakening for me.

1271616,A107ZX1O8JZCN5,B002JIOOCQ,"Vicki Hopkins, Author ""Vicki Hopkins, Author""","[0, 0]","Nick Fallin.  Could there possibly be a more complicated character than this dude?  Psychologists must have loved watching this creation on television with his multifaceted personality.  He can be a tongue-tied child at one moment and a savvy attorney the next as he argues your case in front of the judge. He's intelligent, closed off, and barely communicates. To top it off, he's a former drug addict going through a very reluctant rehabilitation.The story begins when Nick, who was arrested for misdemeanor drug possession, is sentenced to 1,500 hours of community service.  He's the rich kid, who had everything.  His father is the big-shot attorney in Philadelphia who owns his own firm. He sent Nick off to boarding school at the age of 12 when his mother died.  His father is no better in expressing an ounce of honest emotion than Nicholas. The man can barely lift his head for two seconds to give his son eye contact, or if he does, he's pushing his bare palms over his nearly bald head.Even though Nick Fallin is a complicated mess that sometimes you want to shake by the shoulders and bring out of his shell, you have this motherly urge to hug him and let him know everything will be okay.  What I found intriguing is Simon Baker, who plays his role very well.  His facial expressions, his eye movements, the way he shrugs his shoulders, uses body language, or lifts the corner of his mouth up in his usual non-verbal responses tells you exactly what he's going through. When he smiles it flashes for a brief moment and then gets reigned back lest you think Nick could really be happy.  When you believe you have him figured out, he reacts differently and frustrates the hell out of you. On top of his inability to communicate and express his feelings, he is emotionally cut off from others. His greatest flaw is his denial that he doesn't have a problem, which he clearly does.His community service begins working with child legal services in representing children in court.  At first his arrogant pride puts him far above that kind of work. He's awkward to the point he's clearly challenged in dealing with emotional situations, especially those of kids. As the show progresses and the children make a difference in his life, you slowly learn that Nick Fallin is nothing more than a soft-hearted teddy bear deep down inside, with a rock-hard shell.  He just can't show it unless wild horses drag it out of him, or a particular woman.As the season progresses, the child community service loses its funding and becomes legal aid for adults.  Once again, he's challenged because he has to deal with adults as well as children. He falls for a woman in the office, but can't bring himself to tell her he cares until its too late.  His relationship with his father is tested to the core, and he once again dabbles in drugs for a short time to numb the pain he cannot express.All in all, after watching the first season, I'm going to tune in the others.  It's a great show.  Actually, a bit educational as well, especially learning what the legal guardian does for a child in court.  As far as Simon Baker, he's nice to look at.  In some of the shots, he looks very young.  He's supposed to be 32 in the series, but he reminds me at times of a 22 year old.  It's interesting to see how he's matured in his current work in The Mentalist.The other characters, as usual, have their own lives that suck you in, gut none are really as interesting as Nicholas.  It's worth the watch.  Of course, it only took me 12 years to finally get around to it, but what the heck.  Better late than never.SPOILER ALERT REGARDING ENDING OF SERIESThe series finale after Season 3 was a huge disappointment to me.  The writers could have done a wonderful job ending the series with a decent closure. Instead they focused upon a sub-plot regarding capital punishment that took up too much time from the lives of Nick, Lulu, his father, and Alvin.I wanted to yell at the writers of the show.  Okay, I get that all things come to an end, but not giving Nick and Lulu a happily ever-after relationship really disappointed me. You are led to believe their relationship is healed, and suddenly Lulu turns cold toward him when he's finally come to a place of responsibility and healing.Nick has bent over backwards to heal their relationship, care for their baby, purchase her a house, set up a trust fund, and go to counseling besides attending a rehab program and keeping clean.  Everything she asked for, he did.  The woman had too much control over his life and heart and gave him nothing in return but pain and rejection. I wanted to slap Lulu for not loving Nick, when it's clear that all the viewers fall in love with his repentant character.  I'm not sure if the writers knew that the season was not being renewed when it was written, but if they did....badly done...badly done.  I got the impression they really didn't care to end it on a high note or give the viewers what they hoped for all along.",4,Nick Fallin - The Complicated Male Brain,1367971200,"05 8,
