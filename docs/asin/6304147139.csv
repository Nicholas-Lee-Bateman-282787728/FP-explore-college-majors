Such is the case in viewing the very popular 1996 film UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL, a film whose nidus is Alanna Nash's expos&eacute;  book 'Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch' adapted and remolded for the screen by no less than Joan Didion and John Gregroy Dunne, under the careful and tidy direction of Jon Avnet,  and starring two of screen's most popular talents Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer.The film suggests the Jessica Savitch story, the newswoman who, in the 1970's, became the ""First Woman Anchor"". Sally/Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is from the other side of the tracks in Reno who is obsessed with becoming a news star.  She fakes her r&eacute;sum&eacute;, barges into an important television studio run by the indomitable Warren Justice, fakes is and fails as a weather forecaster, yet is so refreshingly purposeful that she is taken under the wing of Warren in a Miami newsroom, given not only a makeover in appearance, but also the chance to make a difference in a news story involving the sad plight of Cuban exiles swimming to freedom in Florida, and becomes a news star on TV. There is a chemistry between the two and despite Warren's tendency to marry and divorce frequently the two fall in love. Yet despite her love for Warren, she takes the big chance and moves on to Philadelphia, where he follows to rescue her faltering career at the cost of his own - as she rises he falls.  It is a love story and more - a Pygmalion reshaping of a true tale.Both Redford and Pfeiffer look and act great and they are surrounded by a fine cast of extras - Stockard Channing, Kate Nelligan, Joe Mantegna, etc.  Nice to remember when love stories were not just about potty mouth derring-do, but instead were well written and well crafted little films.

However, a more solid story line would have helped to make it a better movie.  The male lead, Warren Justice (Robert Redford), is initially portrayed as a competent, local TV newsman.  Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is his new love interest (who has no experience, just desire).  She skyrockets to the network level, in a very short period of time, after Warren Justice's tutelage and grooming.  Time passes, and she performs poorly at the network level.  Thus, the agent who got her the gig tells Warren that his new love is in trouble, and Warren needs to go help her.  So far, so good.  But then, the movie becomes pretty ridiculous.  Why?  Well, after Warren helps his protoge get back on track, and helps her become successful at the network level, he decides to relocate.  So, he leaves his local TV station in Florida and decides to set up shop in Philadelphia, where he can be near his love --- guiding her, stabilizing her, eventually marrying her, etc.  However, when HE (the experienced, competent, wiser, older) wants a job, no one will hire him!  You see, Mr. Justice used to be a network anchor, but he was known as a difficult maverick back in the day.  Thus, absolutely no one can think of any use for him.  The fact that his protoge surpasses him in ability, competence, and overall appeal is hard enough to swallow; the fact that the man was simply unemployable just wasn't believable... especially when it was clear to everyone (including the agent who asked him to rescue her!) that Warren Justice had given her good training, and that he continued to be of help to her.

Up Close and Personal takes many aspects of this film plus many other great romance classics, like Pygmalion and A Star is Born.Sally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an ambitious woman who wants to break into the nightly news game.  She fakes an audition tape and sends it every news department.  She gets a bite from a small station in Miami.  Channel 9 news is headed by veteran Warren Justice (Redford).  He immediately sees through Sally's disguise but he sees something in her.Sally keeps on trying and absorbing everything about the news.  And one day, the weatherman walks off and Warren puts Sally on (but changes her name to Tally.)  Tally is an unmitigated flop but according to Warren ""the camera eats her up.""  Warren takes her under his wing and turns her into a first rate journalist.  Eventually, she becomes an anchor.During a sweeps story at a penitentiary, Tally gets caught up in a prison revolt.  But this gives her a unique opportunity, she is the only reporter on the inside.  Her coverage goes national and she becomes a media sensation.  It's not long before the networks come knocking on her door but Warren has escaped that rat race and is not interested in returning.With Tally a star, Warren decides that it is time to get back into the game but on his own terms.This is the return of Redford, the romantic actor.  He proves two decades later he still has it.  Pfeiffer, like her character, was coming still coming up and this helped prove she could handle a romantic lead.  This film also features two great supporting performances from Stockard Channing and Kate Nelligan as two of Warren's exes.This is a great date film or to watch after a break-up.  And it has the only great Celine Dion song - Because You Love Me.DVD EXTRAS: NONE",5,Redford Does it Again,1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,1862,"['Robert', 'Redford', 'starred', 'one', 'undisputed', 'great', 'romance', 'films', 'time', 'Way', 'Were', 'Up', 'Close', 'Personal', 'many', 'aspects', 'film', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'romance', 'classics', 'Pygmalion', 'A', 'Star', 'Born.Sally', 'Atwater', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'ambitious', 'woman', 'who', 'break', 'nightly', 'news', 'game', 'audition', 'tape', 'news', 'department', 'bite', 'small', 'station', 'Miami', 'Channel', '9', 'news', 'headed', 'veteran', 'Warren', 'Justice', 'Redford', 'immediately', 'Sally', 'disguise', 'something', 'her.Sally', 'keeps', 'trying', 'absorbing', 'everything', 'news', 'one', 'day', 'weatherman', 'walks', 'Warren', 'Sally', 'name', 'Tally', 'Tally', 'unmitigated', 'flop', 'according', 'Warren', 'camera', 'up', 'Warren', 'wing', 'first', 'rate', 'journalist', 'Eventually', 'anchor.During', 'sweeps', 'story', 'penitentiary', 'Tally', 'caught', 'up', 'prison', 'revolt', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'only', 'reporter', 'inside', 'coverage', 'national', 'media', 'sensation', 'not', 'long', 'networks', 'come', 'knocking', 'door', 'Warren', 'escaped', 'rat', 'race', 'not', 'interested', 'returning.With', 'Tally', 'star', 'Warren', 'time', 'get', 'back', 'game', 'own', 'terms.This', 'return', 'Redford', 'romantic', 'actor', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'still', 'Pfeiffer', 'character', 'was', 'coming', 'still', 'coming', 'up', 'helped', 'prove', 'could', 'handle', 'romantic', 'lead', 'film', 'also', 'two', 'great', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'two', 'Warren', 'exes.This', 'great', 'date', 'film', 'watch', 'break-up', 'only', 'great', 'Celine', 'Dion', 'song', 'Love', 'Me.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'NONE']",Up Close & Personal VHS

Maybe I missed the point, but it seemed to me that almost nothing about this movie was real.

404234,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,6304147139,Thayer,"[4, 5]","When the movie is viewed as a love story, it woks because of the oozing charisma of the two leads and also likable enough story albeit formulaic. But the problem is when we look at it as a movie about the news which is not even a problem because no one in the right mind thinks this is a movie about the news, this is not Broadcast News or Network, but the movie keeps on insisting that it is. It's either the director was delusional or in denial. That was probably because the movie was supposed to be darker in tone, that's the original concept because it was going to be based on a true story. But as the filming went along the production decided to lighten up the movie and veered from the original concept not realizing that this is no longer a movie about the news, it's  already a full fledge love story.Anyway Pfeiffer was luminous. She is just one of the few actresses who continue to soar even with a mediocre material. She was really a delight to see, she is truly a screen goddess. Robert Redford seemed old for the role and it doesn't help that he acts as if he's still doing the prequel of Barefoot in the Park. The duo have great chemistry, and really carried the film together.This is not a movie for everyone, some may find it really corny and sappy, but for those who are Pfeiffer and Redford fans this is definitely a film to watch, only because this is definitely a star vehicle kind of film. the two stars made the film.
