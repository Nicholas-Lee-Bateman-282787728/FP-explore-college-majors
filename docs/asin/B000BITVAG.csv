One day, after a horrible storm, they find the body of a young man washed up on the shore. He is still alive but badly injured and in need of constant care. The sisters find out that the youth is from Poland, unable to speak English, and a first-rate violinist. As the bond between the sisters and their newfound friend grows, they find it more difficult to let him go. As he begins to pull away from them to pursue his love of music and his passion for a Russian woman living nearby, the sisters face uncertainty and fear about their futures.I think this film is an excellent one to view as a family because it is so touching and it really has a beautiful story to tell. Fans of Judi Dench and Maggie Smith won't be disappointed by these talented actresses performances.

In your rapture you almost walk right past a tiny painting in the corner, an unassuming, faultless Vermeer.  That is this movie.  Watch it on its own terms, in its own time, and you will certainly love it.Ladies In Lavender is a star vehicle for two British Grande Dames, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith - that's hard to beat for star power.  (Indeed, the only thing missing in this movie is Helen Mirren.)  Almost everything except the plot fuels the story, the plot is so small it would be easily lost in the garden these sisters keep.  Place is massively important, and brilliantly recreated.  Pace is massively important; these people lead simple, slow lives.  Most of all, emotional nuance drives the bus here, Maggie Smith can say more with a furrowed brow than any ten Hollywood actors with a well-polished script.The film invites adult viewers to take an adult look at the many different forms love takes, and their consequences.  From the bitter and cynical aging doctor, to the painfully vulnerable and naive Ursula, Dench, to the cool yet kind Janet, Smith, this film weaves leitmotifs with such a deft hand you barely notice.  The young man, Andrea, is played adequately by Daniel Bruhl, while Olga, young, manipulative, and ambitious, is the girl everyone loves to hate because she seems to have it all.  Olga is played by Natascha McElhone.  Ms. McElhone is fortunate to have been blessed with model-esque good looks; if you look carefully you can see her being out-acted by a footstool, a washstand, and a pair of knitting needles.Those who enjoy metaphor and symbolism will not have to meditate overly long before realizing that the love these aging sisters bestow on their innocent foundling is a give and take proposition.  Ultimately they commit the greatest act of selflessness any person can, they must free their ""child"" and let him live.  (Irony here since they are what used to be charmingly referred to as ""barren."")  In so doing, they allow a great talent to bloom - sharing it with the world.  This brings us to the film's other star, Joshua Bell.  Bell provides the actual violin virtuosity behind the scenes, and his technique and range are chilling - from barn dance sawing rowdy enough to set the Strad on fire, to subtle trills that could make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.

However, the settings are great and Andreas the stranded violinist plays his part convincingly.

Lees,"[4, 4]","Other reviewers have more or less summarized the plot of this film: set in the days before World War II commences, two spinster sisters have their genteel lives disrupted by a near-dead young man washed up on the shore in front of their Cornish home.  As they nurse him back to health, the younger sister falls helplessly in love with him.So many reviewers have chosen to focus on the age of the actresses, yet what is really important here is the sparse script, the light-handed direction, and the consumate skill with which the three leads and the supporting cast play their roles.  It is quite heartbreaking to see Ursula going so hopelessly through the pangs of a love she should have felt in her teens or early twenties, when now she is in her sixties.  The young men she would have known and loved all died in the trenches of World War One, so her naive heart is helpless in the face of her first love.  As she comments towards the end of the movie, ""it's not fair.""This is a beautiful miniature of a movie, akin to a Vermeer in the way it captures all the tiny details of someone else's life and touches us with the humanity of what we all share: our vulnerable hearts.  We see the various characters trying to pursue as best they can their various agendas; yet in the end it is the one person who does not appear to pursue anything who ends up winning all.  The young man Andreas, who months before was washed up on a foreign beach, ends up performing a masterwork in London to the acclaim of all.  He is really just the mechanism through means of which the hearts of others are variously exposed.Maggie Smith and Judi Dench turn in performances that are breathtaking in their craft and apparent simplicity.  If Oscars were actually handed out for acting, they each would have scored Best Leading Actress.

It takes place in Cornwall in the 1930s, where two elderly sisters, Janet (Maggie Smith) and Ursula (Judi Dench) live on the coast. One day they discover a young man (Daniel Bruhl) on the beach, nearly dead. They take him to their cottage and call the doctor, and eventually discover that his name is Andrea and he is Polish. He also speaks German, and Janet has a German/English dictionary and can talk to him a little. Ursula takes a more direct approach and teaches him English. Her method is charming: she labels everything in his room with its English name.He has a broken ankle, and so is in bed for some time. One day, Janet starts to play the piano (badly), and he complains, holding his head. He says he prefers violin. So a friend of theirs who plays fiddle (badly) comes to visit. Andrea asks to borrow the violin, and plays like an angel. Olga, a young woman vacationing nearby, happens by and hears the music coming out of the bedroom window. But Janet and Ursula are rude to her, and she goes away.So begins a tension between the two old ladies and the young one, who turns out to be the sister of a very famous violinist, one Andrea calls ""a god."" Of course, Olga wants Andrea to meet her brother.There's war news on the radio, and here's this foreign young man who has never explained who he is or how he came to be in the surf. The constable comes by asking questions, but Janet and Ursula put him off. It is odd, perhaps, but apparently nobody ever asked Andrea about the incident that nearly killed him. At one point we see a flashback that seems to suggest he was intentionally dumped, but that's not clear.No, he does not turn out to be a spy or a royal prince hiding from assassins. He's just an adorable young man with a wonderful gift for the violin.

Cunningham ""Cris Cunningham""","[4, 4]","In pre-war England two sisters, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench, have their quiet seaside vacation abruptly interrupted when they notice the body of a young man  washed ashore near their cottage the morning after a terrible storm. They take the young man home and, with the help of their housekeeper (a real card...she's hysterical!) begin the arduous process of nursing him back to health. When he is strong enough to be able to communicate with them, they realize he is of Polish descent. Thus one of the sisters, Ursula (played beautifully by Judi Dench) takes it upon herself to teach him English, and in the process, develops romantic feelings for him. We soon learn that the young man is Andrea, a gifted violinist who was trying to get to America in pursuit of a better life. As he grows stronger in health and is constantly provided for by the sisters, he begins to yearn for friendships outside of their household. However, the two sisters, particularly Ursula, remain very possessive of him and make every attempt to limit his outside dealings with others. Conflict arises when Andrea befriends a beautiful German artist who has rented a cottage in town, and the villagers begin to suspect that they are up to no good.What is so refreshing about this film is the superb acting by Dench, Smith and an outstanding supportive cast. Nothing is forced on the viewer; the action is all very laid back and the story just sort of unravels as the actors carry us from one scene to another. Granted, the entire premise of the story is a bit, dare I say ""unimaginative"", but the acting is what makes this so incredibly beautiful. Give this one a go on a leisurely afternoon when you have a couple of hours to spare and want to spend uniterrupted time with a laid back movie.

Plus there's the creepiness factor in that the two old ladies practically kept him prisoner, refusing to let the authorities know they'd found him, apparently unconcerned that someone somewhere might be worried about him.

May be it's because she has so many years of her life and I'm only beginning to... But her love is so beautiful, and tender... I know she's there to pray for me at all times. This story is quiet different of course. But it does portray a love of an older lady, just about 65 year old, for a young man, just about in his early 20s. Of course dont' take me wrong, my mom doesn't love me in ""that way"", ahhh, that's wrong.. but this lady actually does kinda go farther then just a motherly love for this young man they found on a beach... She saves his life of course, but she can't help it but fall in love with him... It's kinda touching because she knows there is nothing she can do. And she knows nothing will ever happen. She knows she's old and naive and silly... Her friend is there to support her, but that's just about it... I say this movie is amazing in every way. And let me tell you, if I was that young man, I'de show at least a little more effection towards the lady... He didn't in my opinnion really apretiate the gift that the ladies gave him... He was too young I guess... but they were too old.. If time ver told him and reminded him of the ladies love, it was probably too late cuz they were gone.... Well they're not gone, not in the movie... I'm just saying...By the way, this movie is not for those who don't have any clue of what it's like to be old. I am 25, but I do have a 65 year old mom mind you! And I know that age doesn't change a thing. Age is just there to take us away from this world, but no matter how old, we are young. We still have same emotions, same laughter.... Not of course if you try hard to hide it all inside, but that's another story... The point is, if you are young, of if you have never been in love, of if you just dont' quite have any respect for older people, this movie is not for you. Otherwise,I do recommend this movie.

Unless it's the film's ""fault"" that I stayed up way too late, watching it in its entirety twice. Yet I can't complain because it was worth it. The first time I laughed aloud a lot; not many reviewers here mention the humor, but it's present alright; just presented subtly by the fine acting talents of Maggie Smith and Judi Dench (and others), making it all the more delightful. ""Ladies in Lavender"" is sweetly moving as well, as the two spinster sisters living in Cornwall in the 1930's receive an unexpected ""guest"" who suddenly rocks their world. So I was compelled to watch it immediately a second time, to prolong the enjoyment. Yes, there are unlikely coincidences; yet in director Charles Dance's hands, it doesn't matter. The story plays out well regardless, with just the right emphasis in just the right moments to make it seamless. Actually, viewers will discover when they watch the DVD extras that there were coincidences involved in the making of this movie that were just as unlikely...Mind you, these extra features  include none of the boring, ego-driven minutiae that one usually encounters in these formats; just brief interviews with the Grand Dames and Mr. Dance that illuminate the process and enhance one's enjoyment of it.I thank Charles Dance for choosing to make a short story that he happened upon, called ""Ladies in Lavender"", as his directorial debut.

A storm washes a young man ashore. Janet and Maggie find him and take him home where they discover that his name is Andrea (Daniel Bruhl), he speaks only German and Polish, and he turns out to be a world-class violinist.The plot cashes in on the use of coincidence--a beautiful young Russian woman, Olga (Natascha McElhone) who also speaks German just happens to be a few feet up the road. Heaping coincidence upon coincidence, Olga's brother just happens to be yet another world class violinist (silly me--and I thought such talent was rare).Now ... imagine for a moment, that you're one of those two elderly women ...Do you:a) Try to find out who the young man is and how he got there?b) Enlist Olga's help to discover what you can about Andreac) Look in the paper to see if there have been any ships wrecked in the area?d) None of the above.Well according to the script of ""Ladies in Lavender"", the correct choice is d). Janet and Ursula take Andrea into their home, nurse him, but are apparently totally uninterested in his past or how he came to be washed ashore on their beach. So be prepared to check credulity at the door when you begin ""Ladies in Lavender"" from director Charles Dance. Heavy on sentimentality, the film flirts with the notion that both women hang onto Andrea for several reasons, and Ursula has perhaps the most difficult time as she even dreams about a romantic liaison with Andrea. Actor Daniel Bruhl as Andrea looks decidedly uncomfortable in his role, or perhaps he just wants to get away from Janet and Ursula.The film relies on the laurels of both of these fine actresses when expecting us to swallow this sentimental pap, and while I have a soft spot for Maggie Smith (and the Cornish Coast), the film remains--to this viewer at least--nice to look at--but maudlin and preposterous--displacedhuman",2,Quick where's the antidote?,1134604800,"12 15, 2005",2005,1956,"['brink', 'WWII', 'two', 'aging', 'sisters', 'Janet', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Ursula', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'live', 'together', 'Cornish', 'coast', 'storm', 'young', 'man', 'ashore', 'Janet', 'Maggie', 'find', 'take', 'home', 'where', 'discover', 'name', 'Andrea', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'only', 'German', 'Polish', 'out', 'be', 'world-class', 'violinist.The', 'plot', 'cashes', 'use', 'coincidence', 'beautiful', 'young', 'Russian', 'woman', 'Olga', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'who', 'also', 'speaks', 'German', 'just', 'be', 'few', 'feet', 'road', 'Heaping', 'coincidence', 'coincidence', 'Olga', 'brother', 'just', 'be', 'yet', 'world', 'class', 'violinist', 'silly', 'thought', 'such', 'talent', 'was', 'rare', '.Now', 'imagine', 'moment', ""'re"", 'one', 'two', 'elderly', 'women', 'Do', 'Try', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'young', 'man', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'b', 'Enlist', 'Olga', 'help', 'discover', 'what', 'can', 'Andreac', 'Look', 'paper', 'see', 'have', 'been', 'ships', 'wrecked', 'area', 'd', 'None', 'above.Well', 'according', 'script', 'Ladies', 'Lavender', 'correct', 'choice', 'd', 'Janet', 'Ursula', 'take', 'Andrea', 'home', 'nurse', 'are', 'apparently', 'totally', 'uninterested', 'past', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'washed', 'ashore', 'beach', 'So', 'be', 'prepared', 'check', 'credulity', 'door', 'when', 'begin', 'Ladies', 'Lavender', 'director', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Heavy', 'sentimentality', 'film', 'flirts', 'notion', 'women', 'hang', 'Andrea', 'several', 'reasons', 'Ursula', 'perhaps', 'most', 'difficult', 'time', 'even', 'romantic', 'liaison', 'Andrea', 'Actor', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'Andrea', 'decidedly', 'uncomfortable', 'role', 'perhaps', 'just', 'get', 'away', 'Janet', 'Ursula.The', 'film', 'relies', 'laurels', 'fine', 'actresses', 'when', 'expecting', 'swallow', 'sentimental', 'pap', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Cornish', 'Coast', 'film', 'viewer', 'least', 'nice', 'look', 'maudlin', 'preposterous', 'displacedhuman']",N/A

The film takes place in 1936 before the WWII begins. One morning, the sisters discover a young man, almost a boy injured and washed ashore near their home and their lives were changed forever. The sisters take the boy in and care for him. As time passes, they learn that Andrea was on the ship heading to America where he hoped to become a professional musician. Andrea is extremely talented violinist and one day, his playing attracts the attention of a young Russian woman -painter, Olga who lives in the village. Olga's brother is a world renowned violinist and she is ready to offer the boy the chance of his life but the sisters, especially Ursula (Dench) seems very reluctant to let Andrea and Olga communicate. Ursula who never been married feels deep tenderness, warmth, and longing for Andrea that she has difficulty to hide. Her sister who is very close and compassionate to her sees quite well what goes on but she also understands that some dreams would always stay just the beautiful dreams...The main reason to see the movie is acting and chemistry between two beloved actresses, both in their 70s and both on the top of their profession. As for the story of two lonely elderly sisters in their coastal home, it was told better in Lindsay Anderson's ""Whales in August"" (1987) that starred Bette Davis and Lillian Gish, and Anderson's film does not have a young foreign boy to make it compelling and moving. The verbal and silent communication between two sisters as played by Gish and Davis makes the earlier movie a quiet and  poignant gem. As for the unrequited tender vulnerable love that comes when one least expects it and that makes the life of an older person heaven and hell at the same time, watch ""Death in Venice"", the tragic masterpiece by Luchino Visconti.",3,The Ladies are magnificent - but they always are,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,2038,"['Ladies', 'Lavender', '2004', 'film', 'starring', 'two', 'best', 'British', 'actresses', 'Dame', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'two', 'lonely', 'sisters', 'widow', 'old', 'maid', 'who', 'live', 'quietly', 'uneventfully', 'cottage', 'seaside', 'Cornwall', 'England', 'film', 'place', '1936', 'WWII', 'One', 'morning', 'sisters', 'discover', 'young', 'man', 'almost', 'boy', 'injured', 'washed', 'ashore', 'home', 'lives', 'were', 'changed', 'forever', 'sisters', 'take', 'boy', 'care', 'time', 'passes', 'learn', 'Andrea', 'was', 'ship', 'heading', 'America', 'where', 'hoped', 'become', 'professional', 'musician', 'Andrea', 'extremely', 'talented', 'violinist', 'one', 'day', 'playing', 'attention', 'young', 'Russian', 'woman', '-painter', 'Olga', 'who', 'village', 'Olga', 'brother', 'world', 'renowned', 'violinist', 'ready', 'offer', 'boy', 'chance', 'life', 'sisters', 'especially', 'Ursula', 'Dench', 'very', 'reluctant', 'let', 'Andrea', 'Olga', 'communicate', 'Ursula', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'married', 'feels', 'deep', 'tenderness', 'warmth', 'longing', 'Andrea', 'difficulty', 'hide', 'sister', 'who', 'very', 'close', 'compassionate', 'sees', 'quite', 'well', 'what', 'also', 'dreams', 'would', 'always', 'stay', 'just', 'beautiful', 'dreams', 'main', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'two', 'beloved', 'actresses', '70s', 'top', 'profession', 'story', 'two', 'lonely', 'elderly', 'sisters', 'coastal', 'home', 'was', 'told', 'better', 'Lindsay', 'Anderson', 'Whales', 'August', '1987', 'starred', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'Anderson', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'young', 'foreign', 'boy', 'make', 'compelling', 'moving', 'verbal', 'silent', 'communication', 'two', 'sisters', 'played', 'Gish', 'Davis', 'earlier', 'movie', 'quiet', 'poignant', 'gem', 'unrequited', 'tender', 'vulnerable', 'love', 'when', 'one', 'least', 'life', 'older', 'person', 'heaven', 'hell', 'same', 'time', 'watch', 'Death', 'Venice', 'tragic', 'masterpiece', 'Luchino', 'Visconti']",N/A

They nurse him back to health and, in the process, Ursula (Judy Dench) falls in love with him. There are hints of some backstory here that you never get to see, but that you feel as though she is trying to reclaim some lost love that she never had as a young woman.Eventually, the young man recovers and goes off to claim his destiny as a talented musician. This is where the plot fell flat for me as it seemed sort of contrived at how he just happens to be heard by the sister of a famous violinist. We also never found out about his background (besides being Polish), how he learned to play, what happened to the ship he was on...those plot points just seemed to fall by the wayside.Overall, a nice quiet movie to watch if you enjoy slow and gentle British historical movies.

Beautiful roles for older women may be hard to find these days and when a movie comes along with two such roles you could not ask for anything better than to have two wonderful Ladies, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, take on those roles.  This movie was adapted from a short story of the same title but its silver screen life comes from the actors who played their parts to perfection.The movie takes place in a small Cornish village where the viewer is given an immediate sense of isolation - perhaps isolation from life, from emotions and from vulnerabilities.  The sisters Ursula and Janet Widdington, played by Dench and Smith, spend a quiet, uninvolved existence, venturing out rarely.  But on one of their walks along the beach that they find a young man washed ashore after a storm.  A bit befuddled they nevertheless take this young may into their home to help him recuperate.  This one act of kindness leads to unexpected consequences for we see that age is not a barrier to unleashing emotions, feelings that have been hidden for so many years.  It is the ability of Dench and Smith to portray these emotions, these feelings, for the camera that make this movie sing.  And the melody of the movie is also carried nicely by the supporting roles played by Daniel Bruhl and Natascha McElhone.  Together these actors make this move work on several levels to give the viewer a splendid evening's entertainment.",5,Charmed by Ladies in Lavender,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,1544,"['Ladies', 'Lavender', 'rare', 'gem', 'movie', 'world', 'today', 'soft', 'spoken', 'tale', 'age', 'character', 'Beautiful', 'roles', 'older', 'women', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'days', 'when', 'movie', 'along', 'two', 'such', 'roles', 'could', 'not', 'ask', 'anything', 'better', 'have', 'two', 'wonderful', 'Ladies', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'take', 'roles', 'movie', 'was', 'adapted', 'short', 'story', 'same', 'title', 'silver', 'screen', 'life', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'parts', 'perfection.The', 'movie', 'place', 'small', 'Cornish', 'village', 'where', 'viewer', 'given', 'immediate', 'sense', 'isolation', 'perhaps', 'isolation', 'life', 'emotions', 'vulnerabilities', 'sisters', 'Ursula', 'Janet', 'Widdington', 'played', 'Dench', 'Smith', 'spend', 'quiet', 'uninvolved', 'existence', 'venturing', 'out', 'rarely', 'one', 'walks', 'beach', 'find', 'young', 'man', 'washed', 'ashore', 'storm', 'bit', 'befuddled', 'nevertheless', 'take', 'young', 'may', 'home', 'help', 'recuperate', 'one', 'act', 'kindness', 'leads', 'unexpected', 'consequences', 'see', 'age', 'not', 'barrier', 'unleashing', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'have', 'been', 'hidden', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ability', 'Dench', 'Smith', 'portray', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'camera', 'make', 'movie', 'sing', 'melody', 'movie', 'also', 'carried', 'nicely', 'supporting', 'roles', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'Together', 'actors', 'make', 'move', 'work', 'several', 'levels', 'give', 'viewer', 'splendid', 'evening', 'entertainment']",N/A
943104,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BITVAG,Grady Harp,"[4, 6]","Short stories often make better films than full novels as is evident in the case of JD Locke's 'Ladies in Lavender' as adapted for the screen and directed by the multi-talented Charles Dance.  Given the barest outline of a quiet little idea of a 'fairy tale', LADIES IN LAVENDER becomes an unfolding meditation of quiet lives altered by an incident that awakens sleeping needs and emotions.Ursula (Judi Dench) and Janet (Maggie Smith) are elderly sisters living a quiet life of gardening, strolling the cliffs and beach of Cornwall, knitting, and reading. Their bumpy housekeeper Dorcas (Miriam Margolyes) cooks, cleans, shops, and chatters in a wonderful Cornish brogue, allowing the sisters to live an otherwise isolated life - isolated from history, personal emotions, and vulnerabilities.  After a storm Ursula spies a figure on the beach below their home and the two descend to find an unconscious handsome young man whom they rescue, house, nurture, mend a broken ankle and ultimately become doting adorers. The young man Andrea (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) finally awakens, speaks no English as he is Polish, and his charming ways attract inner emotions in both sisters.  Janet studies some German and is able to speak with Andreas, while Ursula pastes English words on items in his room to teach him English.  He mends and it is discovered that he is a concert violinist who was shipwrecked while striving to go to America.  A Russian visitor to the town, Olga (Natascha McElhone), the requisite `evil witch' for a fairy tale,  hears Andreas play, informs him she has a cousin who is a famous violinist, and attracts him away from Cornwall to London where he ultimately gives his own concert.Those are the bare facts of the film's story.  The magic lies not in the story itself but in the submerged feelings of the two sisters.  Ursula, having never been in love in her youth, falls in love with Andrea, fully aware that there is no possibility of consummation. She feels long desired emotional attachment to the lad and the stirring in her breast is overwhelming to her. Janet, who once loved but lost that love to death, likewise falls for Andrea.  It is this sibling rivalry over the passion for Andrea that provides some of the most touching and understated brilliant acting moments ever recorded on film.  There is a scene where, resting from a stroll on the cliffs, Andrea rests with his head on Ursula's lap, perhaps the first physical contact with a man she has ever known, and the gentility of the slow and reticent placement of her hand on Andrea's resting head is a crystal of acting magic.  How the sisters cope with this time with Andrea and his eventual leaving for his career is the climax of the film.  And touching and understated it is.Judi Dench and Maggie Smith give pitch perfect characterizations, creating two lovely beings we will never forget. Likewise Daniel Br&uuml;hl is superb in a role far different from his usual German repertoire (Goodbye Lenin!, The Edukators, Love in Thoughts) and manages to create the illusion that he is actually playing the violin (while the true artist is Joshua Bell in some stunning performances).  The atmosphere of Cornwall is magically captured by Dance and his cinematographer Peter Biziou with assistance from Ed Rutherford.  Nigel Hess has written a musical score, incorporating well-known classical violin works as well as his own hauntingly beautiful music that adds immeasurably to the film's success.LADIES IN LAVENDER is not a major blockbuster of a success nor does it try to be.  It is simply a exquisitely crafted and acted fairy tale that gently reminds us that age does not prevent the heart from responding to that most beautiful of emotions, Love.  Highly recommended.

The plot alone sets up the bittersweet nature of the film - English spinster sisters find a young foreign man unconscious on their beach and nurse him back to health, sparking unexpected feelings of love, insecurity, and foolishness.  But the film's humorous moments, of which there are many, are sprinkled lightly throughout to add a smile and keep the overall tone light, despite some otherwise sad occurrences.The entire cast is wonderful, including a tremendous bunch of eccentric villagers that ""introduce"" the young man to England, but best of all are the sisters played by Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith.  Both are at their quietly graceful best, imbuing every scene with the subtle sense of reality that we've come to expect from them.Also worth noting is the Special Features section of the DVD.  I don't usually watch those much, but I was glad I did this time.

Cofield,"[1, 1]","Any film with Judi Dench and Maggie Smith is automatically worth buying, but Ladies in Lavender has a special appeal beyond even the draw of these two fine actresses.In the late 1930s two lonely sisters live a quiet life in Cornwall.  One morning they discover a mysterious young man washed up on the beach near their home.  As they nurse him back to health, they discover old memories and some regrets, and learn new love and tenderness.  The young man reveals unexpected depths and gifts and shows his own gratitude and love for the sisters, even when tempted by glamour and beauty.This is a kindly, pleasing story with enormous emotional appeal.  There's enough humor to keep the mood from getting too dark, but the overtones of the times, (of which we are reminded by occasional radio news reports) are always present to provide more pathos.

Two sisters in the autumn of their life --(Ursula) Judi Dench and (Janet) Maggie Smith are living an ordinary life in Cornwall (Southern England near the seasore) in pre-world War II England when their world turns extraordinary as a young Polish foreigner Andrea (Daniel Bruhl -- GOOD BY LENIN!) washes ashore badly injured near their coastal home. The surprise visitor (and guest) at their home changes them dramatically -- for Janet it awakens motherly insticts, for Ursula (Dench)the presence of the gorgeous and talented young man touches a romantic part of her that has been dormant her whole life...and brings out naive responses that are so human. For the visiting artist down the road Natascha McElhone the young man's amazing musical talent touches not only her awareness of brilliance and importance of living out your potential...the local folks in Cornwall -- who are a breed of their own -- they even speak a kind of Gaelic are wary and later even suspicious of what this young man means to a pre-war England...could he be a spy? Who is that other foreigner who speaks German-- the artist...For the two sisters...the artist seems to interfere in their little triad of the two sisters and Andrea....charming, tear jerker that seems to be a modern type fairy tale (as noted on the special interview with the screenwriter and stars on the DVD supplement).

943122,A2CZBGIJP8TZ1T,B000BITVAG,Joy,"[16, 20]","Finally!  A film with TRUE acting and TRUE drama without nudity, special effects, blood, gore, and crude humor finally comes to the U.S. after many, many years!  I'm only 26 years old but I definitely know real acting when I see it and Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith, Britain's most beloved actresses know how to act and give outstanding performances in Ladies In Lavender.  Directed by Britain's talented actor, Charles Dance, a directorial and screenplay writing debut makes Ladies In Lavender what films are meant to be:  TRUE Drama, TRUE acting, beautiful scenery and even worked very closely to the music composer Nigel Hess and has very beautiful classical music.  Joshua Bell plays the violin parts in the film and it's so breathtaking that I has to buy the Original Soundtrack to this wonderful film.  I saw Ladies In Lavender twice in the theatre and wish I could have seen it a third time but since this film had very little showings, which is very unfortunate, I will just have to wait until it gets released on DVD.Ladies In Lavender is a breath of fresh air from all the ""crap"" that Hollywood calls films these days.  Ladies In Lavender is a British film, made perfectly by Charles Dance, who knows how to make a quality film!  I love how throughout the entire film, you'll see scenes of the sea and birds flying which was all filmed in the U.K.  Dame Judi Dench plays Ursula and Dame Maggie Smith plays Janet, two sisters, two spinsters who live in a Corninsh village, taking place in the 1930's.Ursula and Janet live in a house right by the sea and discover a young man washed up on the shore.  The young man, Andrea, who is played by Daniel Bruhl, turns out to not speak english and to be Polish.  Ursula and Janet take care of Andrea in a guest room for many days, teaching him things and talking to him.  One day it is revealed that Andrea loves the Violin but that's not all, he can play the Violin as well and gives a wonderful performance.  A beautiful young woman, Olga, who is played by Natasha McElhone, is staying in a nearby house and one day hears his playing the Violin, falls in love with Andrea's playing and offers him a chance for real success in London, England.  All the while, Ursula takes a real liking and caring for Andrea and doesn't want him to leave.  This is where Judi Dench's performance really shines and shows more emotion than ever before.  It was so moving that it brought tears to my eyes.  The end scene also made me start to cry because of the two sisters' performance.Dame Judi Dench is now my favorite actress of all time because of this film.  I have cried during my favorite actor's performance, which is why he's my favorite actor but never has an actress's performance ever made me cry until I saw Judi's performance in Ladies In Lavender.  This film is very moving and like the Director of this film states, ""...for all those years she had waited for the prince who never came; and he had come at last out of fairyland cast up by the sea.  She had had with him her brief season of tremulous happiness.""I just cannot wait to get this film on DVD because it's what films are SUPPOSED to be.  Without special effects, cursing, nudity, gore, just ACTING!!!  I might just buy a couple copies, it's that good.And I realized something after my second time watching it that came to my mind not too long ago.  Ladies In Lavender actually has similiarities to the video game, Final Fantasy X.  Both have actually made me cry.  Now I know that all the stuff in between the beginning and end of both are very different but if anyone has ever played Final Fantasy X and then watches Ladies In Lavender or vise versa, will see a similarity.  I'll tell you why.  In Final Fantasy X, the main character, Tidus, is on a ship on the sea and then is thrown to some beach, so he's basically found on some beach on the Isle of Besaid.  In Ladies In Lavender, Andrea is found on the beach.  In Final Fantasy X, Tidus doesn't know anyone, just like Andrea doesn't know anyone.  The end of Final Fantasy X is where you'll see that Yuna, the girl Tidus falls for later in the game, has fallen in love with Tidus but Yuna loses him.  Both Yuna and Ursula both have lost these men, of course the way they lose them is totally different but still, they're both very moving.  Even video games can have very emotional and moving scenes, especially since Final Fantasy X has voice acting and is so realistic looking.  If anyone loved watching Ladies In Lavender and haven't played or seen Final Fantasy X for the Playstation 2, I highly recommend it, and vise versa.I love both Ladies In Lavender and Final Fantasy X and will soon, own both.",5,A TRUE drama with TRUE acting!!,1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,4675,"['Finally', 'film', 'TRUE', 'acting', 'TRUE', 'drama', 'nudity', 'special', 'effects', 'blood', 'gore',

943123,A2EMP366TTS6E1,B000BITVAG,Judith Miller,"[5, 7]","Ladies in Lavender is the story of two lonely sisters who live in an idyllic setting at a beach house in Cornwall.  The ages of Ursula, (Judi Dench) and Janet (Maggie Smith) could have been anywhere from 50 to 65.  The story takes place in 1936 and with the old fashion clothing and no make up, it was hard to determine just how old they were. Janet, who appears to be the elder sister, is apparently a widow, while Ursula seems like she has never been married. Not a lot of background information is given about their early lives or how they came to be living in Cornwall.Their quiet life of gardening and walking the beach changed when they discovered a body lying washed up on the shore one morning. The body is that of a handsome young man (Daniel Bruhl) who turns out to be alive, but unconscious. The young man is taken to their home and a doctor is called. He had an injured foot and needed bed rest. The sisters cared for him and when he is finally able to talk, they found that he did not speak English.  After various attempts at communication, they determine that he is Polish and his name is Andrea.  When Ursula starts to become overly fond of him, Janet cautions her to be careful of becoming too involved. One of the most poignant parts of this film is seeing Ursula, in the twilight of her life, still yearning for love.Andrea turns out to be a gifted violinist and the villagers are all enthralled by his talent. Ursula and Janet become very protective of him especially when a somewhat mysterious and beautiful visitor to the village wants to take Andrea to meet a famous Russian violinist who is visiting London.Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are wonderful British actresses and performed their roles beautifully. They both came across as real people and my only criticism was that I wanted to know more about them and their early lives. I think a few flashbacks would have been helpful in filling out their characters. This film has beautiful scenery and the flavor of the 1930's.P.S.

943130,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000BITVAG,Kevin Killian,"[6, 17]","For a great actress, Dench has made more bad films than anyone since Helen Hayes, and this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel, but I can see that at Amazon it's immensely popular among a vocal claque of fans.  What's up with that?  My guess is that everybody loves the delicate, nuanced byplay between Janet (Maggie Smith) and Ursula (Dench) as the two elderly sisters who sleep side by side in their exquisite Cornwall house, and the fat maid, played by redoubtable ham Miriam Margolyes, is also a hit among the fans who like her being bawdy and Shakespearean towards the two sisters and the young male visitor, who ""hasn't got anything she hasn't seen before.""People also seem to like movies set in the past, and 1936 smudges the edges into a faded romance.  To me, this picture is exactly like NOTES ON A SCANDAL, in which Dench also falls in love with a young beauty decades her junior, except here it's played like something out of a fairy tale.  The young man appears on the strand, near dead, they take him in, they play cavaliers to his sleeping beauty.  NOTES ON A SCANDAL, however, at least took the time to establish the back story of its characters.  Here we know absolutely nothing about Andrea, the handsome young Pole, except that he's charming, roguish, and can play the violin very beautifully.  (Wouldn't it have been a great casting coup if Charles Dance had let US violinist Joshua Bell, who provides the soundtrack, take the part?  He's movie star handsome and Andrea, after all, didn't have to be Polish, did he?  He could have been shipwrecked from America too!)  (Maybe deaf and dumb to provide the element of mystery Dance seems to require for Andrea's character!)This movie did not do well, but that's probably because no man in his right mind would go to a multiplex and say, ""Umm, yes, two for 'Ladies in Lavender' please.""  I'd rather kill myself than utter those words.  It would be easier to buy a case of Tampax at a busy Wal Mart.  But on DVD perhaps some men will enjoy the picture.  Poor Maggie Smith, I hope they paid her a lot of money because in every scene, Judi Dench reaches out her little paw and steals it.I think also that Dance forgot to tell Natascha McWhatever her name is that the movie is set in the 1930s.",3,"Call it, Two Sisters, that would have brought in more patrons",1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,2260,"['great', 'actress', 'Dench', 'made', 'more', 'bad', 'films', 'anyone', 'Helen', 'Hayes', 'pretty', 'much', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'can', 'see', 'Amazon', 'immensely', 'popular', 'vocal', 'claque', 'fans', 'What', 'up', 'guess', 'everybody', 'delicate', 'nuanced', 'byplay', 'Janet', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Ursula', 'Dench', 'two', 'elderly', 'sisters', 'who', 'sleep', 'side', 'side', 'exquisite', 'Cornwall', 'house', 'fat', 'maid', 'played', 'redoubtable', 'ham', 'Miriam', 'Margolyes', 'also', 'hit', 'fans', 'who', 'being', 'bawdy', 'Shakespearean', 'towards', 'two', 'sisters', 'young', 'male', 'visitor', 'who', ""n't"", 'got', 'anything', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'People', 'also', 'seem', 'like', 'movies', 'set', 'past', '1936', 'edges', 'faded', 'romance', 'picture', 'exactly', 'like', 'NOTES', 'SCANDAL', 'Dench', 'also', 'love', 'young', 'beauty', 'junior', 'here', 'played', 'something', 'fairy', 'tale', 'young', 'man', 'strand', 'dead', 'take', 'play', 'cavaliers', 'sleeping', 'beauty', 'NOTES', 'SCANDAL', 'however', 'least', 'took', 'time', 'establish', 'back', 'story', 'characters', 'Here', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Andrea', 'handsome', 'young', 'Pole', 'charming', 'roguish', 'can', 'play', 'violin', 'very', 'beautifully', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'great', 'casting', 'coup', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'had', 'let', 'US', 'violinist', 'Joshua', 'Bell', 'who', 'soundtrack', 'take', 'part', 'movie', 'star', 'handsome', 'Andrea', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Polish', 'did', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shipwrecked', 'America', 'too', 'Maybe', 'deaf', 'dumb', 'provide', 'element', 'mystery', 'Dance', 'require', 'Andrea', 'character', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'probably', 'man', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'go', 'multiplex', 'say', 'Umm', 'yes', 'two', ""'Ladies"", 'Lavender', 'please', ""'d"", 'rather', 'kill', 'utter', 'words', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'buy', 'case', 'Tampax', 'busy', 'Wal', 'Mart', 'DVD', 'perhaps', 'men', 'will', 'enjoy', 'picture', 'Poor', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'hope', 'paid', 'lot', 'money', 'scene', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'out', 'little', 'paw', 'steals', 'it.I', 'think', 'also', 'Dance', 'forgot', 'tell', 'Natascha', 'McWhatever', 'name', 'movie', 'set', '1930s']",N/A

A violent storm washes a young man (Daniel Bruhl) ashore; the sisters take him in and nurse him back to health.  Ursula, the more emotional of the two, is drawn to him immediately and soon has romantic fantasies about him.  Janet, the older, no-nonsense sister, is initially less involved, but slowly she, too, comes to see the young man as ""hers.""  His talent for the violin is noticed by their lovely neighbor (Natascha McElhone), but the sisters are jealous of her interest and want to keep him to themselves.This little movie is quite fragile and touching.  There's not a lot of action here, but the two stars make it a most satisfying experience.  The focus is entirely on their emotional reaction to the presence of the mysterious young man, and both Dench and Smith are masters in the arts of facial expression and speech.  Dench's never-married Janet will tug at your heartstrings as she curls up alone on the young man's bed and cries, and Smith's Ursula is a multi-layered character as well.  Miriam Margolys plays a crusty housekeeper for a bit of comic relief, and the always reliable David Warner is a lovelorn village doctor.

Over a short period of time both sisters find themselves captivated by this young man.  They learn that he is a skilled violinist.

But also, and perhaps more confounding, this charming young man triggers unsettling feelings and memories of young unrequited love and longing.I don't think the theme in this movie could have succeeded without the talent of Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. Dench's character, Ursula is especially [emotionally] complicated because she finds herself drawn to this young man with somewhat of a school girl 'crush' ... feeling all the more awkward and confusing because it is a yearning that was never fulfilled in her youth.What was remarkable about this pleasant film is that it captivated the sentiments and rivalry of these two sisters, while at the same time it showed the close ties each had toward one another.Best of all there was a bit of lite humor throughout the film, and I enjoyed the cinematography of the English coastline and the small town scenes.Finally, although I found this film pleasantly entertaining, the soundtrack featuring the brilliant talent of the violinist, Joshua Bell made watching the film all the more enjoyable.I enjoyed, LADIES IN LAVENDER immensely.

Moore,"[3, 4]","""Ladies in Lavender,"" the debut of star character actor Charles Dance as a writer-director, virtually defines the concept of ""mood piece."" Certainly the story begins with a momentous, dramatic event: aging sisters Ursula (Judi Dench) and Janet Widdington (Maggie Smith) discover a shipwrecked, half-drowned young man (Daniel Bruhl) on the beach near their Cornwall home, and nurse him back to health. After that, however, very little happens in the dramatic sense; the film is all about the emotions the mysterious young man's arrival stirs in the two sisters--particularly Ursula, in whom the stranger stirs a much belated (and, she realizes, completely hopeless) sexual awakening. Dance's script is based on a short story by an author named William J. Locke, and as often occurs with feature-length films based on short stories, the script is undernourished. Nothing that happens is really a surprise: once the sexy, vaguely predatory painter Olga (Natascha McElhone) appears, you know the role she will play in the story, and that's that. Meanwhile, great actors such as David Warner and Miriam Margulyes do what they can with their underwritten roles; other fine actors, such as the father-son team of Freddie and Toby Jones, barely get any screen time at all. As the young man, Bruhl--who was so excellent in ""Goodbye Lenin""--has little to do except look adorable and play the violin. McElhone makes a little stronger impression, but not much. Even the magnificent Smith is too often relegated by the script to being stiffly sensible; the only fully realized character is Dench's. But her character, plus the exquisite, heart-melting Cornwall landscapes and seascapes captured by photographer Peter Biziou, are enough to put the movie across. The poignant mood of ""Ladies in Lavender"" is what stays with you: how two quiet lives are touched for a short time by what turns out to be a much bigger life, and how they go back to their routine after it's over, with nothing but the memory left to them.

Dence regard this movie as a fairy tale  based on his comments in the featurette :""Ladies in Lavender :a fairy tale""  I quote:""In fairy tales you have to believe it, there are question that should and remained unanswered , you have to have faith; once upon a time..."". The movie is about two spinster sisters, Ursula (Judi Dench) and Janet (Maggie Smith) who are attracted (each for different reasons), to a young ""Prince"" Andrea who wouldn't come (Daniel Bruhl ). The sisters' pursue for happiness is intimidated by a young ravishing beauty Olga (Natasha McElhon) the ""Witch"".This interpretation by the Director, seems to be too simplistic; it misses the intentions of the original author of this short story W. J. Locke. The story was written after (?) World War-I conveys the aftermath of war on these who were left behind to suffer the consequences. In this case Janet lost her fianc&eacute; and she sees in Andrea the son who was never conceived. Her sister Ursula never experienced love; caused by the carnage of men eligible for marriage. Ursula's tragedy actually is that her prince DID come BUT arrived TOO LATE. Therefore she experienced only the pains of unrequited love, and not the bliss of a fulfilled love.Locke intended to shock the reader by creating an absurd situation of an elderly woman attracted and falling in love with a considerably younger man.  This style of exaggeration intensifies the tragedies caused by war. Had Ursula never meet the ""prince"", she could have continued living a peaceful life, not knowing what she had missed. But since the prince came, but arrived too late, love remained unfulfilled, she realized her loss while her sister realized the emptiness of her own existence.Bottom line, this is a pacifistic and humanistic story, and not a fairy tale as the Director wrongly thought.

Mysterious young Polish man gets washed ashore.  Two old maids take him in. He is healed.  He plays the violin beautifully. Judi Dench falls in love with him.  He goes away and becomes a concert violinist.  End of story.  Kind of a film festival-type film.  There was no climax, no real problem solved.

While I can't say it entirely did in this case, it certainly wasn't one of the better movies I saw this weekend.Dench and the equally charming Maggie Smith (whose legacy will now forever be tied with the Harry Potter movies, the poor girl) play spinster sisters who rescue a Polish lad, Andrea Marowski (The Bourne Ultimatum's Daniel Bruhl), when he washes up on their beach after being shipwrecked. Both sisters are drawn to the boy romantically, but find themselves competing for his affections with a stranger in town, Olga Daniloff (Solaris' Natasha McElhone). What's a woman to do when the competition for her romantic interest is fifty years younger?While it's impossible to fault most of the aspects of this movie (the acting, the cinematography, etc., are all stellar), Dance's script (based on a William Locke short story) and direction are not terribly accomplished. Dance has over the years stamped himself as a fine, fine actor, but you know the old saying. The script leaves barely enough of the story for the viewer to get a handle on what's going on, but doesn't give us characters strong enough to entirely drive the movie. That said, Dance does seem to have an eye for certain shots (the movie's final shot, while somewhat predictable, is still enough to redeem some of the movie's shallower flaws). Perhaps a bit of experience and a co-writer will make it work for him.Interesting, kind of.

943170,A387BD735MI50R,B000BITVAG,R. Schultz,"[8, 10]","Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are superb in their roles as sisters, tacitly resigned to living out their days together without the prospect of adventure or romance to rock their boat. But then a handsome young man is washed ashore on their beach. And his taunting nearness becomes almost too much for the Judi Dench character to bear. Her suffering brings back all the heartache most of us must have suffered as teenagers facing an impossible love. But for teenagers, as little as they may believe it at the time, there is always tomorrow. For these sixty-something ladies - there perhaps aren't that many tomorrows. This makes their twilight longing all the more poignant.Actor Charles Dance directed the movie and gives the commentary on the DVD's bonus materials. Dance brings his usual onscreen hautiness to his narrative about the genesis of the film. In fact, he goes beyond hautiness to a discernable condescension as he describes the plight of these ladies. His assured distancing of himself from the story's characters provides a further, unintentional commentary - a commentary on how much more women's liberation has yet to accomplish. Dance himself is sixty-something, but seems hardly compelled to identify with any impossible longing. He as a man can still feel assured that all romance, even romance with a twenty-year-old woman, would still be well within his reach. It is only women for whom such an age difference means cinematic pathos.However there is hope. Dance says that the old short story that inspired him to make this film had forty-year-old spinsters as its protagonists. At the time the short story was written, that sort of age divide made love impossible. Now, romance between a forty-year-old woman and a twenty-year-old man would barely be commented on in many circles, much less deemed impossible. The age difference had to be expanded for this modern movie to retain its original point of impossible longing. So the boundaries of permissable love are constantly expanding and may even one day routinely include romance between older women and young men.However this movie carries a caution against the total freedom of such affiliations. I was hoping that the young man would break away from convention into a kind of Harold and Maude delight with Judi Dench. But he couldn't. He was too hide-bound. And he had a streak of youth's too common cruelty in him (as shown by his amused appraisal of the sisters' housekeeper as ""a sack of potatoes). He also had a tad too great a sense of his own importance and the rendevous with destiny he had to keep as a famous violinist. No, he couldn't be detained by two elderly women. But Judi Dench wasn't aware of the youth's essential dullness in these matters, because she didn't speak any German, the only language the lad had in common with any of the English folk he found himself marooned amidst.So in a sense, this movie points out that even if age ceases to be a barrier between two people ""getting together,"" it might still be advisable that they go beyond wellings of physical tenderness in their attraction. It might still be advisable that they speak the same language and truly get to know each other. As it was, Judi Dench walked into a much freer life than she would have known had the youth in fact been available to her.This is a touching movie, flawlessly acted. It seems to have missed finding an audience on the big screen. So it's good to have it on DVD, where a person can enjoy it in the more personal surroundings of hearth and heart.",4,Wistful and Blue,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,3529,"['Judi', 'Dench', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'are', 'superb', 'roles', 'sisters', 'tacitly', 'resigned', 'living', 'out', 'days', 'together', 'prospect', 'adventure', 'romance', 'rock', 'boat', 'then', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'washed', 'ashore', 'beach', 'taunting', 'nearness', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'character', 'bear', 'suffering', 'back', 'heartache', 'most', 'must', 'have', 'suffered', 'teenagers', 'facing', 'impossible', 'love', 'teenagers', 'as', 'little', 'may', 'believe', 'time', 'always', 'tomorrow', 'sixty-something', 'ladies', 'perhaps', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'tomorrows', 'twilight', 'longing', 'more', 'poignant.Actor', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'directed', 'movie', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'materials', 'Dance', 'usual', 'onscreen', 'hautiness', 'narrative', 'genesis', 'film', 'fact', 'hautiness', 'discernable', 'condescension', 'plight', 'ladies', 'assured', 'distancing', 'story', 'characters', 'further', 'unintentional', 'commentary', 'commentary', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'women', 'liberation', 'yet', 'accomplish', 'Dance', 'sixty-something', 'hardly', 'compelled', 'identify', 'impossible', 'longing', 'man', 'can', 'still', 'feel', 'assured', 'romance', 'even', 'romance', 'twenty-year-old', 'woman', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'well', 'reach', 'only', 'women', 'whom', 'age', 'difference', 'cinematic', 'pathos.However', 'hope', 'Dance', 'old', 'short', 'story', 'inspired', 'make', 'film', 'had', 'forty-year-old', 'spinsters', 'protagonists', 'time', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'sort', 'age', 'divide', 'made', 'love', 'impossible', 'Now', 'romance', 'forty-year-old', 'woman', 'twenty-year-old', 'man', 'would', 'barely', 'be', 'commented', 'many', 'circles', 'much', 'less', 'deemed', 'impossible', 'age', 'difference', 'had', 'be', 'expanded', 'modern', 'movie', 'retain', 'original', 'point', 'impossible', 'longing', 'boundaries', 'permissable', 'love', 'are', 'constantly', 'expanding', 'may', 'even', 'one', 'day', 'routinely', 'include', 'romance', 'older', 'women', 'young', 'men.However', 'movie', 'caution', 'total', 'freedom', 'such', 'affiliations', 'was', 'hoping', 'young', 'man', 'would', 'break', 'away', 'convention', 'kind', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'delight', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'could', ""n't"", 'was', 'too', 'hide-bound', 'had', 'streak', 'youth', 'too', 'common', 'cruelty', 'shown', 'amused', 'appraisal', 'sisters', 'housekeeper', 'sack', 'potatoes', 'also', 'had', 'tad', 'too', 'great', 'sense', 'own', 'importance', 'rendevous', 'destiny', 'had', 'keep', 'famous', 'violinist', 'No', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'detained', 'two', 'elderly', 'women', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'youth', 'essential', 'dullness', 'matters', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'German', 'only', 'language', 'lad', 'had', 'common', 'English', 'folk', 'found', 'marooned', 'amidst.So', 'sense', 'movie', 'out', 'even', 'age', 'be', 'barrier', 'two', 'people', 'getting', 'together', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'advisable', 'go', 'wellings', 'physical', 'tenderness', 'attraction', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'advisable', 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'truly', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'was', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'walked', 'much', 'freer', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'had', 'youth', 'fact', 'been', 'available', 'her.This', 'touching', 'movie', 'flawlessly', 'acted', 'have', 'missed', 'finding', 'audience', 'big', 'screen', 'good', 'have', 'DVD', 'where', 'person', 'can', 'enjoy', 'more', 'personal', 'surroundings', 'hearth', 'heart']",N/A

943172,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000BITVAG,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[29, 30]","""Ladies in Lavender"" tells the tale of two elderly sisters, Ursula (Judi Dench) and Janet (Maggie Smith), who share an ancient cottage in Cornwall, England on the eve of WWII. One morning after a violent storm, they find a young man washed up on the beach, more dead than alive. They take him in and tend to him, quickly discovering that he speaks no English, but he speaks German and says he is Polish. The fact that he speaks German arouses local suspisions, as the villagers wonder if he could be a German spy.Time passes quickly, and Andrea (Spanish-German Daniel Bruhl, better known for 2003's Good Bye, Lenin!) quickly proves his talent with the violin. Matters are complicated when both of the sisters fall for Andrea. The tender, naive Ursula seems to have never had a beau, and despite the great age difference between her and Andrea, clearly is pondering a sexual relationship with him. Janet tries to rein her in, to no effect.A mysterious, beautiful stranger named Olga is also a newcomer to the village. Although she, too, speaks German (and French), she is Russian, sister of the famous violin virtuoso Boris Danilof. This important information is withheld from Andrea, as the sisters strive to keep him for themselves, but Andrea is miserable at having his career as a concert violinist kept at arm's length. He begins to spend more and more time with Olga, to the distaste of Ursula and Janet, and in a fateful conversation, he is told of Olga's identity and of her famous brother, who wants to meet Andrea. His conscience torments him at having to make the choice between leaving the kind-hearted sisters and seizing his rightful place in the concert halls of the world.Ursula's childish love affair with Andrea is heartbreaking. She asks Janet about her dead beau several times, asking ""if you really loved him."" Janet catches Ursula in Andrea's room at night, touching him while he is asleep. And in a brief dream sequence, we see Ursula as a young woman, rolling about in the fields with Andrea. She is so fragile, so naive, and heartbroken when Andrea ultimately makes his choice, that Judi Dench's performance can be hard to watch in these scenes.Beautiful cinematography of Cornwall, a gorgeous soundtrack with virtuoso Joshua Bell, two legends of British theater, and a strong supporting cast makes ""Ladies in Lavender"" another example of why British cinema is some of the best out there.

Veteran British actresses Judi Dench and Maggie Smith star as Ursula and Janet Widington, play two sisters who discover a young man on the beach that borders their home in coastal England. The young man, Andrea is played by German actor Daniel Bruhl, a name familiar to independent film buffs as the star of GOODBYE LENIN and THE EDUKATORS. The plot of the film is somewhat basic. The two sisters nurse the young man back to health, discover he is a Polish immigrant headed to America, and that he has musical talent. The two become attached to the young man for different reasons. For Janet, he is someone who shares her tastes, for Ursula, it is a reminder of the love her life has never had and she has a bit of a misplaced crush on the young man. There are secondary characters who add some tension to the film: the artist Olga Danilov played by Natasha  McElhone, Dr. Mead, the older man who falls for Olga and is jealous of her interest in Andrea, and the lovable housekeeper Dorcas played by Miriam Margoyles. The secondary characters add spice to the film, but never take away from their relationship between Ursula, Janet, and Andrea.The film is somewhat predictable. After recovering, an artist visiting the town is the sister of a great classical performer/conductor/performer. She discovers his talent and he become a success, all in a relatively short time. Viewers make allowances for the somewhat basic plot because of it s many strengths: great acting and believable characters, a homespun British village that reminds us of a time gone by that viewers understand will soon be over, and a luscious musical score.While LADIES IN LAVENDER did not have a wide distribution, playing mostly in art houses and specialty theatres, its release on DVD is sure to catch people's attention and will most will find it's an enjoyable and uplifting film.",4,An Enjoyable and Well Acted Film,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,1928,"['LADIES', 'IN', 'LAVENDER', 'film', 'many', 'things', 'working', 'favor', 'Veteran', 'British', 'actresses', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'star', 'Ursula', 'Janet', 'Widington', 'play', 'two', 'sisters', 'who', 'discover', 'young', 'man', 'beach', 'home', 'coastal', 'England', 'young', 'man', 'Andrea', 'played', 'German', 'actor', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'name', 'familiar', 'independent', 'film', 'buffs', 'star', 'GOODBYE', 'LENIN', 'THE', 'EDUKATORS', 'plot', 'film', 'somewhat', 'basic', 'two', 'sisters', 'nurse', 'young', 'man', 'back', 'health', 'discover', 'Polish', 'immigrant', 'headed', 'America', 'musical', 'talent', 'two', 'become', 'attached', 'young', 'man', 'different', 'reasons', 'Janet', 'someone', 'who', 'shares', 'tastes', 'Ursula', 'reminder', 'love', 'life', 'never', 'had', 'bit', 'misplaced', 'crush', 'young', 'man', 'are', 'secondary', 'characters', 'who', 'add', 'tension', 'film', 'artist', 'Olga', 'Danilov', 'played', 'Natasha', 'McElhone', 'Dr.', 'Mead', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'Olga', 'jealous', 'interest', 'Andrea', 'lovable', 'housekeeper', 'Dorcas', 'played', 'Miriam', 'Margoyles', 'secondary', 'characters', 'add', 'spice', 'film', 'never', 'take', 'away', 'relationship', 'Ursula', 'Janet', 'Andrea.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'recovering', 'artist', 'visiting', 'town', 'sister', 'great', 'classical', 'performer/conductor/performer', 'talent', 'become', 'success', 'relatively', 'short', 'time', 'Viewers', 'make', 'allowances', 'somewhat', 'basic', 'plot', 's', 'many', 'strengths', 'great', 'acting', 'believable', 'characters', 'homespun', 'British', 'village', 'time', 'gone', 'viewers', 'understand', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'luscious', 'musical', 'score.While', 'LADIES', 'IN', 'LAVENDER', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'wide', 'distribution', 'playing', 'mostly', 'art', 'houses', 'specialty', 'theatres', 'release', 'DVD', 'sure', 'catch', 'people', 'attention', 'will', 'most', 'will', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'uplifting', 'film']",N/A

The story is so worn you wonder why actor Charles Dance chose it for his directorial debut. Watching Dench and Smith work this material easily answers the question.Dench, in the showier role, and Smith are heaven sent, tapping years of acting experience, some of it together, and a longtime friendship to enliven these wistful ladies to within an inch of stereotype. Bruhl is a charmer (his soulful playing is that of violinist Joshua Bell). In its way, this little movie is quite brave.

The competition fosters unrest between the sisters.The young man, Andrea, gets English lessons from one sister and the best tidbits from the kitchen.  When they learn of his interest in violins, they arrange for a local fiddle player to entertain him during his recuperation.  Andrea borrows the violin and demonstrates admirable skill with the instruments.The quiet story gets complicated when one sister's attachment to the youth becomes too serious for the age disparity.  Also a young foreign woman takes an interest in Andrea and his violin playing.  There seems a bit of mystery about her reason for being in the village.

Judi Dench and Maggie Smith play two sisters living by themselves in a sleepy coastal hamlet in Cornwall. The story is set in 1936, and the sisters enjoy a great level of independence, their lives being quite comfortable, with a housekeeper helping them out with chores.The introductory scene is quite significant as it shows a free-spirited and carefree Ursula (Judi Dench) running through the waves, collecting sea shells, and splashing seawater on her more restrained older sister Janet (Maggie Smith). The contrast between the two sisters is very evident from the beginning, and plays an important role in what follows later.One morning, Ursula sees a body washed ashore, and both sisters get help. It turns out a young Polish man, Andrea (Daniel Bruhl) has survived a shipwreck and sustained some minor injuries. The sisters generously offer their home and hospitality to the young man, and gradually a close bond forms between the three. But it is Ursula who is the most affected by the young man's presence. Initially, her maternal instincts come to the fore, and she cares for Andrea as a coddling mother would, nursing him through his injuries, ensuring all his needs are taken care of. Later though, an infatuation clouds Ursula's thinking, and she finds herself attracted to Andrea, experiencing a sexual awakening that can only be fulfilled in her dreams, knowing it is never to be.In the meanwhile, Andrea reveals his talent for playing the violin, and this extraordinary gift attracts the attentions of a holidaying Russian artist, Olga (the beautiful Natascha McElhone). Olga tries to befriend the sisters, but they, sensing some sort of `threat' from this younger, attractive woman, spurn her attempts, thinking by doing this Andrea will remain with them. The story is told in such a gentle, poignant manner that one cannot help but feel sorry for the two old ladies who see in Andrea a refreshing break from their previously monotonous, humdrum life. Ursula is the most affected, given that she never experienced affectionate love with a man, and keeps asking Janet how her own love affair was.The story sort of reminded me of a mature (in terms of years) Sense and Sensibility, with Janet portraying the more composed and restrained older sister (like Elinor Dashwood), who tries to do what's best for her sister, and Ursula playing the unrestrained and passionate younger sister, driven more by her feelings than her rational thinking (very much like Marianne Dashwood!).It is also about older people and how age does not mean that one can't feel passion or wanting. This is portrayed in the character of the widowed village doctor, Dr. Francis Mead (David Warner), who despite his years, is infatuated by the lovely, young artist Olga (McElhone). When his affections are subtly but clearly spurned, he becomes bitter and malicious.The backdrop of the coastal village in Cornwall, with its wind-swept waves, and bucolic setting makes this movie a pleasure to watch.
