Not only is this a story of the Cavalry in the southwest, not only a story of Calvalry versus Indians, not only of romance, and not only of solid characters, this is a gutsy story of inherent racism in the country, of murder and of courtroom drama.Woody Strode plays an excellent Sergeant Rutledge, the black 9th Cavalry top sergeant accused of the rape and murder of a white woman. Jeffrey Hunter plays a strong Cavalry lieutenant, assigned to the black ""Buffalo Soldiers"" that patroled the 19th century southwest. He leads them in combat and he stands tall to defend Sergeant Rutledge.The storyline moves along with each element working in tandem.

999181,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000G6MXIK,David Baldwin,"[32, 34]","""Sergeant Rutledge"" speaks alot about the character of director John Ford in the twilight of his storied career.  His track record allowed him the luxury of tackling hotbutton issues without consideration of controversy or commercial concerns.  By tackling racism so bluntly in a day where others kind of sugarcoated the topic is a tribute alone to Ford.  That he does so superbly makes ""Sergeant Rutledge"" indispensible.  The film works on so many levels aside from an exploration of racism.  It is a moving tribute to the 9th Calvary division that consisted of African-American troops.  It's also a riveting courtroom drama where you don't feel cheated by the denouement.  Excellent performances with Jeffrey Hunter compelling as the lieutenant assigned the duty of a defending a ""buffalo soldier"" of the unthinkable and Woody Strode solid in the title role.

This is the first film Ford & Woody Strode worked together.  They then became fast friends til Ford's death, & Ford used him in his subsequent films.  (Woody played a VERY unique Mongol barbarian in Ford's last film ""Seven Women"".)  The film studio allegedly didn't want Ford to use Strode in ""SR"", instead pressing for Harry Belafonte or Sidney Poitier, but Ford said the latter two actors ""weren't tough enough"". Here in his first Ford film, Strode is a bit stiff & wooden, but he's absolutely an iconic physical presence & lends great dignity to the role. The movie's racial politics are today somewhat dated, but for its time it was pretty daring & it completely is on the side of the angels.  The final ""shocking"" revelation about a young woman's rape plays like a VERY bad ""Perry Mason"" climax, but that aside, this is a solid (good, but not great)film.",3,A Lesser (but Worthwhile) John Ford Effort,1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,928,"['Not', 'one', 'John', 'Ford', 'stronger', 'films', 'still', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'first', 'film', 'Ford', 'Woody', 'Strode', 'worked', 'together', 'then', 'became', 'fast', 'friends', 'til', 'Ford', 'death', 'Ford', 'used', 'subsequent', 'films', 'Woody', 'played', 'VERY', 'unique', 'Mongol', 'barbarian', 'Ford', 'last', 'film', 'Seven', 'Women', 'film', 'studio', 'allegedly', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Ford', 'use', 'Strode', 'SR', 'instead', 'pressing', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Ford', 'said', 'latter', 'two', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'tough', 'enough', 'Here', 'first', 'Ford', 'film', 'Strode', 'bit', 'stiff', 'wooden', 'absolutely', 'iconic', 'physical', 'presence', 'great', 'dignity', 'role', 'movie', 'racial', 'politics', 'are', 'today', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'time', 'was', 'pretty', 'daring', 'completely', 'side', 'angels', 'final', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'young', 'woman', 'rape', 'VERY', 'bad', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'climax', 'aside', 'solid', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'film']",N/A
999185,AYA9ZUS9Z0BVW,B000G6MXIK,"Jane Pensive ""a film fan""","[4, 5]","... muse for this little film about the black man's place in the segregated army of the late 1800's. No wonder Strode inspired Ford to make this film which stars Strode, although he does not get star billing. Strode is a  magnificent looking actor, who though untrained, (and this is obvious in parts of the film) has a tremendous impact on screen. He is absolutely believable as the chisel-featured ""top soldier"" at his fort, where black cavalry troops are stationed. Here he expertly fights Indians and saves white damsels-in-distress from certain scalpings, without compromising his position as a man who otherwise cannot entertain romantic thoughts about them.He encounters a problem in that he is seen leaving a white officer's home wherein said officer and his lovely daughter are found murdered, the daughter nude, and raped. When Rutledge is charged with the violence he runs away and deserts the army. He is captured, recaptured, and brought back to the fort to stand trial for the crimes. The white officer charged with capturing him defends him at the court martial.Whenever we see a trial in a Ford film, we know we have to put up with some really corny humor and hijinks (Young Mr Lincoln). Why Ford thought the courtroom was the place for idiocy is a mystery. At any rate, some of the important drama in Sergeant Rutledge takes place in court, and the nonsense with the chief judge's wife and her lady friends is not very amusing. It detracts from the drama of the courtroom sequences and lessens the film's impact in my opinion.As in much of Ford's lesser efforts, some of the acting is also subpar. Jeffrey Hunter is not effective as Rutledge's superior officer and trial defender. He has two acting ranges, wooden and shrill. The murderer also does a poor job in his confession scene. Strode, Juano Hernandez and Constance Tower are all good in their roles, and the scenes when the black troopers talk amongst themselves is revealing and engaging. When a black troop is killed during a scuffle with some Indians, one troop comments that he doesn't want to die fighting the white man's battles, after all what is in it for him? When his troops want Strode to account for the charges against him he explains ominously that it is ""white women business"" a situation in which the black man is unlikely to prevail.  But it is Strode's confession as to  why he  lets himself be recaptured to stand trial when he could have gotten away that is compelling and believable. He states that he came back because he had found his dignity and life's work in the army, and he did not want to cheapen his record by running. Strode is very effective in this scene. Although there are problems with the pace and acting in the film it is worth seeing. I think most viewers will come away impressed with the film as a whole.",4,Woody Strode is Ford's...,1280016000,"07 25, 2010",2010,2820,"['muse', 'little', 'film', 'black', 'man', 'place', 'segregated', 'army', 'late', '1800', 'wonder', 'Strode', 'inspired', 'Ford', 'make', 'film', 'Strode', 'not', 'get', 'star', 'billing', 'Strode', 'magnificent', 'looking', 'actor', 'who', 'untrained', 'obvious', 'parts', 'film', 'tremendous', 'impact', 'screen', 'absolutely', 'believable', 'chisel-featured', 'top', 'soldier', 'fort', 'where', 'black', 'cavalry', 'troops', 'are', 'stationed', 'Here', 'expertly', 'Indians', 'white', 'damsels-in-distress', 'certain', 'scalpings', 'compromising', 'position', 'man', 'who', 'otherwise', 'can', 'not', 'entertain', 'romantic', 'thoughts', 'them.He', 'encounters', 'problem', 'seen', 'leaving', 'white', 'officer', 'home', 'wherein', 'said', 'officer', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'are', 'found', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'nude', 'raped', 'When', 'Rutledge', 'charged', 'violence', 'away', 'army', 'captured', 'recaptured', 'brought', 'back', 'fort', 'stand', 'trial', 'crimes', 'white', 'officer', 'charged', 'capturing', 'court', 'martial.Whenever', 'see', 'trial', 'Ford', 'film', 'know', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'really', 'corny', 'humor', 'hijinks', 'Young', 'Mr', 'Lincoln', 'Why', 'Ford', 'thought', 'courtroom', 'was', 'place', 'idiocy', 'mystery', 'rate', 'important', 'drama', 'Sergeant', 'Rutledge', 'place', 'court', 'nonsense', 'chief', 'judge', 'wife', 'lady', 'friends', 'not', 'very', 'amusing', 'drama', 'courtroom', 'sequences', 'film', 'impact', 'opinion.As', 'much', 'Ford', 'lesser', 'efforts', 'acting', 'also', 'subpar', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'not', 'effective', 'Rutledge', 'superior', 'officer', 'trial', 'defender', 'two', 'acting', 'ranges', 'wooden', 'shrill', 'murderer', 'also', 'poor', 'job', 'confession', 'scene', 'Strode', 'Juano', 'Hernandez', 'Constance', 'Tower', 'are', 'good', 'roles', 'scenes', 'when', 'black', 'troopers', 'talk', 'amongst', 'revealing', 'engaging', 'When', 'black', 'troop', 'killed', 'scuffle', 'Indians', 'one', 'troop', 'comments', ""n't"", 'want', 'die', 'fighting', 'white', 'man', 'battles', 'what', 'When', 'troops', 'want', 'Strode', 'account', 'charges', 'ominously', 'white', 'women', 'business', 'situation', 'black', 'man', 'unlikely', 'prevail', 'Strode', 'confession', 'why', 'be', 'recaptured', 'stand', 'trial', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'compelling', 'believable', 'came', 'back', 'had', 'found', 'dignity', 'life', 'work', 'army', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'cheapen', 'record', 'running', 'Strode', 'very', 'effective', 'scene', 'are', 'problems', 'pace', 'acting', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'impressed', 'film', 'whole']",N/A
999186,A245AST0T0AZTJ,B000G6MXIK,J. Lindner,"[4, 5]","This movie is well acted, well written, and has a strong cast.  But most important it is directed by a man who was not afraid to take on racial issues in the days prior to the Civil Rights Act.  Perhaps it was because of efforts like this film that Americans realized the land of the free was less free for people of color.A black sergeant from a group of ""Buffalo Soldiers"" is accused of rape and murder.  Through it all he maintains his sense of duty as a soldier to protect the civilians in the region of his post.  He doesn't whine about mistreatment, he doesn't complain about life being unfair.  He simply does his duty as a soldier, mindful of the responsibilities his rank demands.  During an attack he rides off into the blaze of battle to assist an injured comrade.  During a siege of a remote ranch, he is alone with a white woman but offers her protection and safety.It is the whites of the military and of the main post that try to play the race card when the assault and murders occur.  No one, it would seem to them, would mind if a black man was charged and hanged for the offense, even if it meant the perpetrator remained free to repeat the crime again.  At first the defense attorney at the courts martial was not even going to put up any kind of serious defense of the accused.  He does come around to point out the innocense of his client, only to wrongly conclude who the actual guilty party was.  It is only at this time that the real killer breaks down on the witness stand and confesses.This movie does not get a lot of air time nor does it get a lot of credit.  It was filmed the same year as John Wayne's ""Alamo"" which the Duke criticized Americans for not cozying up to his film.  Wayne said those who did not appreciate the Alamo did not grasp their nation's history.  One could make a stronger case for Sergeant Rutledge.  This movie was even moreso about American society's failure to come to terms with its own lofty standards when it failed to apply equally the tenets of the constitution.  Sergeant Rutledge does much to illustrate the racial divisions at work in American society.  This is also a very gripping movie with a high entertainment value.",4,Sergeant Rutledge,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,2184,"['movie', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'written', 'strong', 'cast', 'most', 'important', 'directed', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'racial', 'issues', 'days', 'prior', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Act', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'efforts', 'film', 'Americans', 'realized', 'land', 'free', 'was', 'less', 'free', 'people', 'color.A', 'black', 'sergeant', 'group', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'accused', 'rape', 'murder', 'sense', 'duty', 'soldier', 'protect', 'civilians', 'region', 'post', ""n't"", 'whine', 'mistreatment', ""n't"", 'complain', 'life', 'being', 'unfair', 'simply', 'duty', 'soldier', 'mindful', 'responsibilities', 'rank', 'demands', 'attack', 'blaze', 'battle', 'assist', 'injured', 'comrade', 'siege', 'remote', 'ranch', 'alone', 'white', 'woman', 'protection', 'safety.It', 'whites', 'military', 'main', 'post', 'try', 'play', 'race', 'card', 'when', 'assault', 'murders', 'occur', 'one', 'would', 'seem', 'would', 'mind', 'black', 'man', 'was', 'charged', 'hanged', 'offense', 'even', 'meant', 'perpetrator', 'remained', 'free', 'repeat', 'crime', 'again', 'first', 'defense', 'attorney', 'courts', 'martial', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'going', 'put', 'up', 'kind', 'serious', 'defense', 'accused', 'come', 'point', 'out', 'innocense', 'client', 'only', 'wrongly', 'conclude', 'who', 'actual', 'guilty', 'party', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'real', 'killer', 'breaks', 'down', 'witness', 'stand', 'confesses.This', 'movie', 'not', 'get', 'lot', 'air', 'time', 'get', 'lot', 'credit', 'was', 'filmed', 'same', 'year', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Alamo', 'Duke', 'criticized', 'Americans', 'not', 'cozying', 'up', 'film', 'Wayne', 'said', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'Alamo', 'did', 'not', 'grasp', 'nation', 'history', 'One', 'could', 'make', 'stronger', 'case', 'Sergeant', 'Rutledge', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'moreso', 'American', 'society', 'failure', 'come', 'terms', 'own', 'lofty', 'standards', 'when', 'failed', 'apply', 'equally', 'tenets', 'constitution', 'Sergeant', 'Rutledge', 'much', 'illustrate', 'racial', 'divisions', 'work', 'American', 'society', 'also', 'very', 'gripping', 'movie', 'high', 'entertainment', 'value']",N/A
999187,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B000G6MXIK,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","Of all John Ford's westerns this is the only one with the main hero being black and the only one which action is situated mostly in the courtroom - and in fact it is as much a judicial drama as a western.This film was made in 1960 and its beginning, which even today can be a little bit scary, was even more controversial in those times. During a dark moonless night, in an deserted train station in the middle of nowhere, a young white woman is suddenly brutaly grabbed and overpowered by a gigantic black man with a menacing face. And things get soon even worse, because we soon learn that this man, Sergeant Braxton Rutledge, is a deserter and a fugitive, wanted for brutal rape and horrible murder of a white teenage girl and also for the murder of her father - who was also his commanding officer...I will say no more, but believe me, this film contains many brutal and shocking twists and surprises, which are only very slowly (but always very logically) explained, with the final shocker coming only at the very end. The timeline in the film is somehow similar to the later &#34;Man who killed Liberty Valance&#34;, but even more complicated - there are many comings and goings between events which happened in the past and the &#34;present time&#34; courtroom in which witnesses take turns to tell the story. Some events are also described by different witnesses in a different way, a little bit like in &#34;Rashomon&#34;, although here there is no doubt about the real truth - at the very end of the film things are established with absolute certainty.This western was one of the very first to picture the &#34;Buffalo soldiers&#34;, black soldiers serving in US Cavalry in the plains during Indian Wars and it shows them with a great respect - and also some quite tender humour...This is also one of more brutal films in the whole John Ford's career. The crime which is the central piece of the film is absolutely horrible and the violence of ongoing war against the Apaches is described in pretty graphic words (no images though - this is an old film). During some of the scenes in the desert, the fear felt by black soldiers and white farmers is almost unbearable, as the arrival of Apache raiders in the area surprised everybody and pending the arrival of military reinforcement, they have the upper hand - and they are known for horribly torturing people they capture alive...Even if on the poster of the film his name was put only in the fourth position, the real star of this film is the black actor Woody Strode (1914-1994), who plays Sergeant Rutledge. This very tall and athletic man with a quite threatening face played in quite a lot of Hollywood films, albeit mostly in second roles. His career started with a western (a cameo in &#34;Stagecoach&#34; in 1939) and ended with another western (a cameo in &#34;The quick and the dead&#34; in 1995 - the film was released soon after his death). Other than those films, he also appeared in &#34;The Ten Commandments&#34; (a cameo as King of Ethiopia), &#34;Pork Chop Hill&#34;, &#34;Spartacus&#34; (Draba, the black gladiator who fought Kirk Douglas), &#34;The man who shot Libert Valance&#34; (Pompey), &#34;The professionals&#34; (the mercenary with the bow), &#34;Once upon a time in the West&#34; (one of gunfighters who wait for Charles Bronson in the beginning) and in a great number of lesser movies. A great friend of John Ford, married to a real Hawaian princess, he had a long, well filled and pretty succesful life.The second major star of the film is Jeffrey Hunter, who in 1960 was at the beginning of what seemed as a very promising career - and he indeed was to star in some important movies and even play the main role of Captain Pike in the pilot of &#34;Star Trek&#34; (the legendary &#34;Cage&#34;), before his untimely and tragic death in 1969. He does a great job in this film as the counsel for the defense and possibly the ONLY MAN in the courtroom who doesn't want to simply hang Sergeant Rutledge and be done with it...All other actors, mostly experienced veterans from &#34;Ford's Company&#34;, also did a great job. Although very dramatic and for those times pretty brutal, &#34;Sergeant Rutledge&#34; contains also some pretty funny moments, quite typical for John Ford's sense of humor. The testimony of the wife of the old colonel who presides the court martial is an absolutely marvelous moment of great comedy in the middle of a great tragedy...)))I watched this film for the first time when I was just a kid and recently I was very pleased to see that it didn't age AT ALL. It is an excellent, very original, very intelligent and very surprising film.
