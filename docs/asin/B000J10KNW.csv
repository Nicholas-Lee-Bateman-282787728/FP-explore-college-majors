Stella Stevens' exquisite eye makeup (including false lashes) has been out of style for about 40 years.SYNOPSIS--Harry Hunter (Wallach) is in love, but not with his spouse! Harry's attorney friend David Sloane (Martin) wants to prove that his buddy's mistress, Muriel (Jackson) will dump him in a second and that Harry should be faithful to Mary (Bard), his wife of 12 years. David goes to the love birds' apartment/nest but by accident mistakes next door neighbor (and employee of Harry's) Carol Corman (Stevens) for the girlfriend.David gets Carol interested in him; he triumphantly reports to his friend that the mistress is unfaithful and has Harry write an impersonal ""Dear Jane"" letter to her. Muriel gets the note, is upset, speaks to Carol and thus the two discover the mens' game. Their revenge includes Carol's demand that David marry her.""How to Save..."" is available on aDVD two-ferwith ""Who Was That Lady"" (1960).

1024159,A4R9MJFF8UFND,B000J10KNW,Brian Camp,"[7, 8]","Dean Martin made quite a few comedies away from the Rat Pack in the 1960s. Most of them were pretty interesting and even the bad ones are worth seeing. This DVD double feature includes one that worked well for me and had me laughing out loud more than a few times and one that didn't work as well and only had me laughing in its last 15 minutes (out of a 115-minute movie).The good one, HOW TO SAVE A MARRIAGE AND RUIN YOUR LIFE (1968), introduces the necessary characters and relationships and builds up the set of circumstances that leads, quite plausibly, to the misunderstanding that sets the plot in motion. We see how shopgirl Stella Stevens (as beautiful as I've ever seen her) learns something incriminating about her boss (Eli Wallach) that leads to a promotion that buys her silence about the apartment where he keeps a mistress, hence starting the rumor that she herself is the boss's mistress, which leads the boss's best friend, Wall Street investor Dean Martin, to try to save his friend's marriage by seducing the ""mistress"" away from Wallach and proving to him how unfaithful she really is. When Dean eventually realizes his mistake--and the look on his face in the course of this scene is just priceless--and the extent of the raveling he'll have to do to undo all the unraveling, it just keeps getting funnier. The key here is that for most of the film the audience knows more than the characters do and suspense is generated as we wait for the characters to catch up.WHO WAS THAT LADY? (1960) never bothers to adequately introduce the characters but instead plunges us into a thoroughly implausible situation with unbelievable, unsympathetic characters whose sheer stupidity is constantly infuriating. Who would believe that Tony Curtis is an assistant professor of chemistry at Columbia University? Or that Janet Leigh would be a glamorous housewife in a lavish Manhattan apartment on an assistant professor's salary? Or that such a professor would have as best friend a CBS writer and swinging bachelor, played by Dean Martin? (Granted, Tony and Janet were married at the time, but these roles just didn't fit them.) To mend things after Janet catches Tony kissing one of his students, Dean comes up with the harebrained scheme of telling Janet that he and Tony are undercover FBI men and the girl with Tony was a ""foreign exchange"" student under ""investigation."" Against all common sense, Janet falls for it and all suspension of disbelief goes out the window. Things get more ridiculous until some genuine FBI personnel, well played by John McIntire and James Whitmore, get involved and take some control of the idiotic farce. When actual Russian spies (played by Simon Oakland and Larry Storch) enter the scene, the star trio is forced to really go undercover. Only then, during a finale in the basement of the Empire State Building, with a drugged Tony and Dean thinking they've woken up aboard a Russian sub, do things finally get funny. Interestingly, three of the cast--Leigh, McIntire, and Oakland--all also appeared in PSYCHO that same year.Both films are presented anamorphically on this DVD. One's in color (HOW TO SAVE A MARRIAGE) and one's in black-and-white (WHO WAS THAT LADY?) and both look flawless.",3,A good Martin comedy paired with a bad one,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,3237,"['Dean', 'Martin', 'made', 'quite', 'few', 'comedies', 'away', 'Rat', 'Pack', '1960s', 'Most', 'were', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'even', 'bad', 'ones', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'double', 'feature', 'one', 'worked', 'well', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'had', 'laughing', 'last', '15', 'minutes', '115-minute', 'movie', '.The', 'good', 'one', 'HOW', 'TO', 'SAVE', 'A', 'MARRIAGE', 'AND', 'RUIN', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', '1968', 'necessary', 'characters', 'relationships', 'up', 'set', 'circumstances', 'quite', 'plausibly', 'misunderstanding', 'plot', 'motion', 'see', 'how', 'shopgirl', 'Stella', 'Stevens', 'as', 'beautiful', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'something', 'incriminating', 'boss', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'promotion', 'silence', 'apartment', 'where', 'mistress', 'hence', 'starting', 'rumor', 'boss', 'mistress', 'boss', 'best', 'friend', 'Wall', 'Street', 'investor', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'try', 'save', 'friend', 'marriage', 'seducing', 'mistress', 'away', 'Wallach', 'proving', 'how', 'unfaithful', 'really', 'When', 'Dean', 'eventually', 'mistake', 'look', 'face', 'course', 'scene', 'just', 'priceless', 'extent', 'raveling', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'undo', 'unraveling', 'just', 'getting', 'funnier', 'key', 'here', 'most', 'film', 'audience', 'more', 'characters', 'do', 'suspense', 'generated', 'wait', 'characters', 'catch', 'up.WHO', 'WAS', 'THAT', 'LADY', '1960', 'never', 'bothers', 'adequately', 'introduce', 'characters', 'instead', 'thoroughly', 'implausible', 'situation', 'unbelievable', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', 'sheer', 'stupidity', 'constantly', 'infuriating', 'Who', 'would', 'believe', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'assistant', 'professor', 'chemistry', 'Columbia', 'University', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'would', 'be', 'glamorous', 'housewife', 'lavish', 'Manhattan', 'apartment', 'assistant', 'professor', 'salary', 'such', 'professor', 'would', 'have', 'best', 'friend', 'CBS', 'writer', 'swinging', 'bachelor', 'played', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Granted', 'Tony', 'Janet', 'were', 'married', 'time', 'roles', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'mend', 'things', 'Janet', 'catches', 'Tony', 'kissing', 'one', 'students', 'Dean', 'up', 'harebrained', 'scheme', 'telling', 'Janet', 'Tony', 'are', 'undercover', 'FBI', 'men', 'girl', 'Tony', 'was', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'investigation', 'common', 'sense', 'Janet', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'out', 'window', 'Things', 'get', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'genuine', 'FBI', 'personnel', 'well', 'played', 'John', 'McIntire', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'get', 'involved', 'take', 'control', 'idiotic', 'farce', 'When', 'actual', 'Russian', 'spies', 'played', 'Simon', 'Oakland', 'Larry', 'Storch', 'enter', 'scene', 'star', 'trio', 'forced', 'really', 'go', 'undercover', 'Only', 'then', 'finale', 'basement', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'drugged', 'Tony', 'Dean', 'thinking', ""'ve"", 'woken', 'up', 'Russian', 'sub', 'do', 'things', 'finally', 'get', 'funny', 'Interestingly', 'three', 'cast', 'Leigh', 'McIntire', 'Oakland', 'also', 'appeared', 'PSYCHO', 'same', 'films', 'are', 'presented', 'anamorphically', 'DVD', 'One', 'color', 'HOW', 'TO', 'SAVE', 'A', 'MARRIAGE', 'one', 'black-and-white', 'WHO', 'WAS', 'THAT', 'LADY', 'look', 'flawless']",The Dean Martin Double Feature - Who Was That Lady / How To Save A Marriage

1024162,A1IT9VY8Z9RG92,B000J10KNW,"G. D. Williams ""gareth37""","[1, 1]","WHO WAS THAT LADY is a 1960 zany comedy with Dean Martin, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, Tony Curtis' wife at the time.  When you toss in the FBI, the CIA and the Russian Intelligence operatives (I use the word intelligence loosely here), you have a comedic first strike.Curtis is an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Columbia University who is caught by his wife kissing a foreign exchange student.  Martin is his best friend who's a writer at CBS who cooks up a hare-brained scheme to convince the wife that her boring husband is a top FBI agent.With the CBS prop department providing FBI credentials and a revolver, the game is afoot.  When the prop master realizes that the FBI credentials were not being used for a show, he contacts the FBI.James Whitmore plays the stoic FBI agent who investigates.  Of course he gets involved with the antics of Curtis and Martin, especially at the Chinese restaurant with shots fired and television news cameras rolling.The ending in the basement of the Empire State Building is classic.  This black and white 115-minute vehicle delivers a great time if you are into old comedies.  Picture and sound quality are excellent.  4 starsHOW TO SAVE A MARRIAGE (And Ruin Your Life) is a classic battle of the sexes.  Dean Martin finds himself embroiled in the battle when he attempts to help his old army buddy save his marriage.Mistaken identify leads Martin to assume that Stella Stevens is the mistress of his army buddy, Eli Wallach. Martin sets out to woo Stevens in order to save Wallach's marriage.Of course Wallach's mistress is Anne Jackson (his wife in real life) who lives next door to Stevens.  A comedy of errors follows for both men.Betty Field is wonderful as Thelma, the landlady, whose cynical attitude rubs off on Stevens and Jackson.  She has a special moment near the end of the film which is pure irony.One of the best comedic scenes happens in a church cemetery. It is hysterical.New York City is the setting.  Michael Legrand's music suits this film well, especially the song--Winds of Change--with the Ray Conniff Singers.  It's one of those late 60s romantic songs which is fitting for this late 60s romantic comedy. Picture and sound quality are excellent.  4 stars",4,The Dean Martin Double Feature - Who Was That Lady / How To Save A Marriage,1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,2225,"['WHO', 'WAS', 'THAT', 'LADY', '1960', 'zany', 'comedy', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'wife', 'time', 'When', 'toss', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'Russian', 'Intelligence', 'operatives', 'use', 'word', 'intelligence', 'loosely', 'here', 'have', 'comedic', 'first', 'strike.Curtis', 'Assistant', 'Professor', 'Chemistry', 'Columbia', 'University', 'who', 'caught', 'wife', 'kissing', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'Martin', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'writer', 'CBS', 'who', 'up', 'hare-brained', 'scheme', 'convince', 'wife', 'boring', 'husband', 'top', 'FBI', 'agent.With', 'CBS', 'prop', 'department', 'providing', 'FBI', 'credentials', 'revolver', 'game', 'afoot', 'When', 'prop', 'master', 'FBI', 'credentials', 'were', 'not', 'being', 'used', 'show', 'FBI.James', 'Whitmore', 'stoic', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'course', 'involved', 'antics', 'Curtis', 'Martin', 'especially', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'shots', 'fired', 'television', 'news', 'rolling.The', 'ending', 'basement', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'classic', 'black', 'white', '115-minute', 'vehicle', 'great', 'time', 'are', 'old', 'comedies', 'Picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', '4', 'starsHOW', 'TO', 'SAVE', 'A', 'MARRIAGE', 'Ruin', 'Your', 'Life', 'classic', 'battle', 'sexes', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'embroiled', 'battle', 'when', 'help', 'old', 'army', 'buddy', 'save', 'marriage.Mistaken', 'identify', 'Martin', 'assume', 'Stella', 'Stevens', 'mistress', 'army', 'buddy', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'Martin', 'out', 'woo', 'Stevens', 'order', 'save', 'Wallach', 'marriage.Of', 'course', 'Wallach', 'mistress', 'Anne', 'Jackson', 'wife', 'real', 'life', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'Stevens', 'comedy', 'errors', 'men.Betty', 'Field', 'wonderful', 'Thelma', 'landlady', 'cynical', 'attitude', 'rubs', 'off', 'Stevens', 'Jackson', 'special', 'moment', 'end', 'film', 'pure', 'irony.One', 'best', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'church', 'cemetery', 'hysterical.New', 'York', 'City', 'setting', 'Michael', 'Legrand', 'music', 'suits', 'film', 'well', 'especially', 'song', 'Winds', 'Change', 'Ray', 'Conniff', 'Singers', 'one', 'late', '60s', 'romantic', 'songs', 'fitting', 'late', '60s', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', '4', 'stars']",The Dean Martin Double Feature - Who Was That Lady / How To Save A Marriage

1024164,A3H9PLV6L2S194,B000J10KNW,Jim Davis,"[0, 0]","Dean Martin has been a favorite since I first became a fan of his variety show in the 1960s. Martin was unique (or at least rare) in having been successful in four major show business venues - feature films, television, recording artist, and major night club headliner. One can't help feeling in retrospect that his partnership with Jerry Lewis, while important, was holding him back and he was wise to end it.The DVD is adequate but not outstanding. There are no extras, just a couple of previews for then new Sony releases. It has a strange feature in that the first screen that pops up allows you to pick the feature you want to watch but once chosen the only way to watch the other feature is to eject the disk. There is no way to get back to the first screen within the disk.The two features were produced 8 years apart and depict some changes in the film industry and American society in general between 1959 and 1967. The first film is a low budget black and white affair at the then standard 1.85 to 1 aspect ratio. By the time of the second film black and white was unthinkable even for the lowest budget and it was filmed in color at the wider 2.35 to 1 ratio. In ""Who was That Lady?"" sex plays no part in the plot while in ""How to Save a Marriage?"" it is front and center though tastefully unstated. Today, of course, it would be depicted. It's also interesting to note things like how while suits were still the uniform of the day in both films but by the time of the later film the hat was no longer part of it.Both films are lightweight but immensely enjoyable. The first is more of what a later generation would call a ""buddy movie"" as Tony Curtis and Martin play off of each other to great effect. The second film is more of a classic romantic comedy with Martin doing most of the heavy lifting. The ladies were adequate but didn't exactly light the screen up. Both Leigh and Stevens are required to be stupid at times to move the plot along. Of the two, I would give the edge to Janet Leigh. Stella Stevens seemed like this was the deepest role she was capable of playing. The supporting casts were surprisingly good. James Whitmore is fabulous in ""Lady"" and while I normally don't think of him as a comedic actor Eli Wallach is great in ""Marriage"".But the main attraction is the laid back charm and great comedic skills of Dean Martin.

Carl,"[1, 1]","This had been on my list for quite sometime, and finally I got it; and I'm so glad I did.Who Was That Lady, and How To Save A Marriage (And Ruin Your Life) are two hilarious films; and they show Dean in top form. I maybe a little bias when it comes to these two fims, because I absolutely adore Dean Martin. He was an amazingly talented and handsome man, but he was (and still is) a very underrated singer and actor. A total shame.In Who Was That Lady, he is Michael Haney, a friend of Tony Curtis's character, David Wilson. After Tony is caught kissing a student in his chemistry class by his wife Ann, played by real wife Janet Leigh, he calls Dean to help him convince Janet and that the kiss was nothing. Dean, a television writer, comes up with a superb, wild fabrication for Tony to tell Janet--he's a FBI Agent, and he had to kiss the girl because he is undercover. Tony doesn't believe it will work, insisting that Janet is not stupid enough to fall for something like that; Dean proceeds to trick Tony into believing that he himself is a FBI Agent. He then points out that if he could get him to believe something like that, it won't be hard to convince Janet that he's an agent. They do trick her into believing, and that is where the film really kicks off.Dean was nominated for a Golden Globe award (which he should have won), and once one sees this film, one will be able to see why.In How To Save a Marriage (And Ruin Your Life), Dean is David Sloan in this film. He's friends with Eli Wallach's Harry, and when Eli's wife, Mary comes and tells him that Harry is cheating on her, he goes to Eli and tries to convince him that he should leave this woman, and go back to Mary. Eli proceeds to tell him that she is a wonderful woman, a woman who actually cares about him unlike his own wife, and that he should see for himself. Dean then sees Carol Corman (Stella Steven's) and believing that she is Eli's mistress, proceeds to try and prove that she is just playing around on Eli, not realizing that Eli's true mistress is Muriel (Anne Jackson), the nextdoor neighbor in Stella's new apartment building (which Dean bought an apartment for, trying to prove that she would leave Eli when a better offer came along). Hilarious events ensues.You cannot go wrong in buying this DVD.

1024169,AVBC26VPR0BAE,B000J10KNW,"Vincent T. Lynch ""vtl""","[12, 12]","""How To Save A Marraige (And Ruin Your Life)"" has long been one of my favorite Dean Martin films.  It's a light romantic farce / drawing room comedy and the pairing between Dean and Stella Stevens works extremely well.  Dean's comic timing shines through and here he was at his most likeable suave romantic lead.  ""Who Was That Lady"" is another favorite that, like the other movie, hasn't been seen much in several years.  It's a gem that lies somewhere between romantic farce and slapstick.  Dean -- as best friend -- plays well off Tony Curtis here, and the absurdity of the plot is what makes this so clever.  While these are not Dean's finest film work (not in the realm of ""Rio Bravo"", for example), you'll enjoy this double feature.  Thanks to SONY for putting it out!",4,Dino pleasantly saunters through,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,774,"['How', 'Save', 'A', 'Marraige', 'Ruin', 'Your', 'Life', 'long', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'films', 'light', 'romantic', 'farce', '/', 'drawing', 'room', 'comedy', 'pairing', 'Dean', 'Stella', 'Stevens', 'extremely', 'well', 'Dean', 'comic', 'timing', 'shines', 'here', 'was', 'most', 'likeable', 'suave', 'romantic', 'lead', 'Who', 'Was', 'Lady', 'favorite', 'other', 'movie', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'much', 'several', 'years', 'gem', 'somewhere', 'romantic', 'farce', 'slapstick', 'Dean', 'best', 'friend', 'plays', 'well', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'here', 'absurdity', 'plot', 'what', 'so', 'clever', 'are', 'not', 'Dean', 'finest', 'film', 'work', 'not', 'realm', 'Rio', 'Bravo', 'example', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'double', 'feature', 'Thanks', 'SONY', 'putting', 'out']",The Dean Martin Double Feature - Who Was That Lady / How To Save A Marriage
