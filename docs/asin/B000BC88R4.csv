One of the reasons I bought it was because there is actually no bluray release of the film, but I felt like I needed to support the production. I also wanted to see what the quality of subtitles were since this is the first time a Hindi movie is presented with such a wide variety of subtitle options.The box says the film is in 1.85:1 ratio and enhanced for widescreens, but it was actually letterboxed! I ended up with a tiny frame on my screen. The digital transfer is poor for such a visual film, it looked dark and the colors lacked vibrancy, while there was a brief period when the film got cut off a few minutes before the intermission title.Subtitles weren't much better, at least the Spanish track was poorly provided, while accents and Spanish symbols rendered as short gibberish as if the track had been enconded wrong. We had to switch back to English because it got distracting in the first 20min of the movie. I also noticed a random subtitle line with &#34;#NAME#&#34; a couple of times in the English track, which also left some lines without translation or got lost with the timing sync (after the intermission).I really really wish Vinod Chopra would release the film in BR with improved visuals and subs.Giving it 2 stars because I don't like 1 star reviews... and the fact that I like the movie.

Sure, the plot is rehashed formula (rich jerk tries to steal house from lowly neighbor, his son falls in love with their daughter, complications ensue). But the subtle handling of the script, the fine acting, the gorgeous photography all take it to a different level of art. The songs are good (""Yeh Hawarein"" is my favorite) and the ending is handled exactly right -- it's dramatic without being a parody.While European or North American viewers may not even notice them, there are a couple of ""steamy"" scenes that shocked a lot of viewers accustomed to the usual general-audience fare in Hindi films. (The actors appear to be in bed, with bare shoulders showing.)But at its base, it's a sweet film, a simple love story suitable for thinking adults. It's a beautiful film, with fine acting, photography and music. If you had never seen a ""Bollywood"" movie before, this is one I would recommend starting with.

To prevent Navinchandra's cunning schemes to evict Lolita's family from their stately home, newly arrived Girish (Sanjay Dutt) takes them under his wing, providing financial support and entertainment. In a rage of jealousy, Shekhar agrees to marry Gayetri (Dyia Mirza), but on finding the truth, defies his father and brings Lolita home. Fine-tuned performances of newcomer Vidya Balan and veteran Saif Ali Khan, superb cinematography and costumes, painstaking attention to recreating Calcutta of the 1960s, touching and engaging music, and the talented hand of first-time director Pradeep Sarkar make Parineeta one of the best Bollywood movies of all times, despite an overcooked ending that has very little credibility and sits somewhat awkwardly with the rest of the film.

This is a movie that lives up to those claims.Briefly (a few spoilers to follow) it is about 2 kindred souls (Saif Alid Khan & Vidya Balan) who have been friends and neighbours since childhood. He considers her so much a part of his life he takes her for granted in many ways but she is always there for him and he has given her a key early on to help herself to his money whenever she wants (though she rarely touches it for things for herself). Meanwhile his father is a greedy businessman who has taken advantage of his neighbour and secretly is going to have him evicted even though the neighbour thinks of him as a friend. Enter rich relative (Sanjay Dutt) on the girl's side of the fence. He is a good man and bails the guy out which angers greedy Dad. Misunderstandings occur and all looks lost for the lovers...This movie is set in the 60s in Calcutta and has reconstructed the look of that period yet is thoroughly modern at the same time. The cinematography is obviously superior from the first frame. The script is tight. The words are poetic and the music full bodied orchestral and rather than a string of traditional Indian dances there are only a few dances in context (such as at weddings and on stage). It is a melodrama and has a full range of emotion that I found quite affecting at times. It is a very beautiful piece with no violence. The actors, both leading and minor, are all very good and get the most out of their pieces. Moving and superb.I had been sitting on this DVD a while and think I kept putting off watching it because the cover made it look a bit dark, old, troubled and inaccessible. None of those expectations held up. It is very accessible for the lover of Bollywood romance yet depicted with such beauty and sensitivity that art-house fans that may often cringe at Bollywood should like this one.

939991,A1U6EO5QH3S0AN,B000BC88R4,Shrutii,"[18, 19]","To continue with the latest fad of Bengali backdrop in Hindi films.. there is is yet another Saratchandra Chatterjee's classic adaptation(after Devdas) in the offing. Both these films were  directed by Bimal Roy in early 1950s.This time debutante director Pradeep Sarkar takes on the adaptation of Parineeta by joining hands with Vidhu Vinod Chopra production house. Chopra has a remarkable past record of good films to his credit and Sarkar comes from a background of advertising and directing music videos.The film starts with Amitabh Bachchan's poetic voiceover introducing 1962's Calcutta(as called then) with sepia color tone welcoming us to the City of joy, of laureates, of processions & strikes, of the section of moderns highly influenced by British raj, of those eating paan & rasgullas, of the banks of Ganga river overlooking the symbolic Howrah bridge sliding into the world of Shekhar Rai(Saif Ali Khan) who is getting married to Gayatri Tantiya(Dia Mirza),a high society resident but his heart belongs to Lolita(debutante Vidya Balan) with whom he had shared the most memorable childhood and and many priceless moments. He chooses to drift back in time taking the film in flashback mode when he as a kid was first introduced by his neighbour Koel(Raima Sen) to her cousin Lolita who after a sad demise of her parents was invited to stay with her maternal uncle. They hit it off from the very first moment... they evolve from neigbours to friends to lovers, an evolution so effortless and non-prentious. A kind and favourite of all Lolita is free to walk into Shekhar's room at any time of the day and has a key to his personal savings and he is free to call her anytime of the day to listen to his new musical score and even expects her to give inputs to make the tune more lilting which she happily does. Outside the world of this deep relationship of trust and unspoken rights over each other, there is a world where Shekhar's aristocratic father(Sabyasachi Chakravarthy) , a very shrewd businessman lives and there is also Girish babu(Sanjay Dutt), a suave London-returned bachelor whose cheerful & generous heart falls for Lolita at first sight. Lolita's call for her  family duties and Shekhar's transition from 'just a Musician' to 'just a Buisnessman' results in friction. Some more trying times fall ahead which force one and all to take some stand in their lives which necessarliy not be pleasing to the other or oneself. So does one make a compromising decision and live with it for lifetime or is there some chance to revert back to where one's soulmate resides?After watching the latest Devdas and Parineeta without reading the originals, still it becomes easier to connect with and understand Saratchandra's affinity for his central characters. The male lead is someone who is very intense & possessive of his lady love, a father-dominated, a hot-headed and pampered. He is irrational when he can't have his way. His love interest is somebody whom he is known since childhood in neighborhood. She walks on a thin line between egotism and self-respect. She is a graceful giver but not the one to be demeaned. Their family backgrounds are socially and monetarily wide apart. Father of the hero is shown very arrogant and has a very high reputation to keep up to and on the ohter side the mother is always very protective of her son but cannot utter a word in his defence to her husband, Father always thinks that his son is good for nothing and wasting time with a girl of no status and eventually ends up calling her a 'whore'. Money seems to subtly seep in amongst the two since childhood depicting the immense trust between them and at the same time juxtaposing father & son's attitude towards money.Pradeep Sarkar seems to have done his homework well and succeeds in creating a beautiful bygone era and justifying every detailing on screen. Vidhu Vinod Chopra adds his talent bit apart from a being a producer as a co-screenplay & co-dialogue writer. Sanjay Dutt gives a vibe of feeling uncomfortable away from his favourite bhai garbs and looks little old for his character. Vidya Balan as a newcomer leaves very little room not to impress, she ignites a spark which is rare to see in today's newcomers and hope she is just not remembered as a one film wonder. Saif Ali Khan comes out a total winner, he shows his potential as an enthusiast musician and an intense lover. For once there is an actor not only moving his fingers on a musical instrument but actually playing the guitar & piano correctly and in total sync..'not bad' at all. Shekhar's such deep musical inclination is brought to life on screen by a relatively new talented composer Shantanu Moitra. The songs nurture the story and move it further. 'Piyu Bole' is more famous, but my favs are 'Soona Mann' and 'Raat Hamari'. A club song to introduce the club culture of Calcutta by none other than Rekha who is at her best in oozing sensuality and singing philosophy at the same time is a must watch. To give the vision to director and actors hardwork is cinematographer Nataraja Subramanian, a job well done. Especially watch out for the refreshing train journey song from Calcutta-Darjeeling. All the characters balance each other very well, but Vidya and Saif's on-screen relationship holds you intently. From their musical symphony to fighting sequences to the passionate ones, these two make you want to fall in love all over again.The gentle flow of this film is rudely interrupted by certain things which could be ignored in the name of cinematic liberties but the climax is too overstated where Shekhar physically breaks the wall dividing the houses of the two families. A metaphor very literally translated.Exempting few flaws and you'll see yourself flowing in Parineeta's world!",3,An ode to Paris of East India,1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,5782,"['continue',
