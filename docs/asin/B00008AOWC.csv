Earl feels responsible for JR and tries to help him out of it. The situation gets bigger and bigger and Earl has to recruit some friends to help him with Junior.

She said it was the funniest thing she's ever seen and I said ""Joshua Jackson, funny?"" and she said ""JUST WATCH IT""...and she was right...this movie is downright histerical. Earl (Jackson) is engaged to his step-sister Baby (Jamie King, the hot former model) who is determined to be a soap star and thus is intent on moving to LA.  They live in some rinky dink Texas town.  Baby has a wayward cousin Junior (DJ Qualls) who she entrusts Earl to keep an eye on, but Junior is almost more trouble than Earl can chew.  You see junior and his delinquent friend Tinker (Ryan Hurst from Remember the Titans) just robbed a pizza delivery boy, the only problem is that he wasn't a pizza delivery boy, but more like a drug runner for some important coke dealers and now Tinker and Junior (mostly junior) find themselves in deep $hit when these men want their drugs and money back.  Earl then enlists the help of his gay best friend Jimmy (Matthew Davis) to help him deliver the goods that Tinker won't hand over.  Problem after problem arises and someone loses a pinky finger resulting in some of the funniest dialog in movie history.  I'm a huge fan of this film.  The cast is spot on, and even though Jackson isn't funny in this movie (he's the serious hero type who hardly cracks a smile) the rest of the cast, including John Mellencamp as Earls hilarious stepfather (Baby's father), is downright brilliant!",5,"""They torn down my Dixie Chicks poster!""",1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,1475,"['cousin', 'brought', 'couple', 'months', 'back', 'told', 'watch', 'said', 'was', 'funniest', 'thing', 'ever', 'seen', 'said', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'funny', 'said', 'JUST', 'WATCH', 'IT', 'was', 'right', 'movie', 'downright', 'histerical', 'Earl', 'Jackson', 'engaged', 'step-sister', 'Baby', 'Jamie', 'King', 'hot', 'former', 'model', 'who', 'determined', 'be', 'soap', 'star', 'thus', 'intent', 'moving', 'LA', 'live', 'rinky', 'dink', 'Texas', 'town', 'Baby', 'wayward', 'cousin', 'Junior', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'who', 'Earl', 'keep', 'eye', 'Junior', 'almost', 'more', 'trouble', 'Earl', 'can', 'chew', 'see', 'junior', 'delinquent', 'friend', 'Tinker', 'Ryan', 'Hurst', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'just', 'robbed', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'boy', 'only', 'problem', 'was', ""n't"", 'pizza', 'delivery', 'boy', 'more', 'drug', 'runner', 'important', 'coke', 'dealers', 'now', 'Tinker', 'Junior', 'mostly', 'junior', 'find', 'deep', 'hit', 'when', 'men', 'want', 'drugs', 'money', 'back', 'Earl', 'then', 'help', 'gay', 'best', 'friend', 'Jimmy', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'help', 'deliver', 'goods', 'Tinker', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hand', 'over', 'Problem', 'problem', 'arises', 'someone', 'pinky', 'finger', 'resulting', 'funniest', 'dialog', 'movie', 'history', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'film', 'cast', 'spot', 'even', 'Jackson', ""n't"", 'funny', 'movie', 'serious', 'hero', 'type', 'who', 'hardly', 'smile', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'John', 'Mellencamp', 'Earls', 'hilarious', 'stepfather', 'Baby', 'father', 'downright', 'brilliant']",Lone Star State of Mind
