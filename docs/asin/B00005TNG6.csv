I could really tell you my favorite part was the very ending when she sang ""The First Time Ever I saw Your Face"" I love the feeling I get when I see her sing it live. I wish they would have put my song ""It Might Be You"" then this concert would have been great! I mean if she can do ""Sweet Geogria Brown"" she could have done ""It Might Be You"".BrandonRoberta's Youngest Fan",4,Great Show but Wanted more favorites,1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,417,"['concert', 'was', 'very', 'intimate', 'fans', 'could', 'really', 'tell', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'very', 'ending', 'when', 'sang', 'First', 'Time', 'Ever', 'saw', 'Face', 'love', 'feeling', 'get', 'when', 'see', 'sing', 'live', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'song', 'Might', 'Be', 'then', 'concert', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'mean', 'can', 'do', 'Sweet', 'Geogria', 'Brown', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Might', 'Be', 'Youngest', 'Fan']",Roberta Flack - In Concert
