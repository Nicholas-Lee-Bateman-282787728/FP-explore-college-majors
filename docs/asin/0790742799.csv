The story[based on another typically great pat Conroy story] tells of a Marine flier post war,now taking clear aim at his children. The competition between he and his older son{okeefe in what should have been a career making performance]is painful to watch,to feel to identify with. The basketball game is one of the most uncomfortable moments I have ever had in a movie theatre. Duvall is superb,though I think his uber overberaing father in too over the top[the end,heroic,is a cop out]. The lovely Blythe Danner is excellent{as always},though it is Duvalls show.

As a couple other reviewers mentioned, it has lots of raw emotion and if you come from a family with either an alcoholic, domineering, and/or military father (usually they have all those traits!) you may have a hard time with this.  It's just sad how hard it is for some people to just be NICE...and normal and enjoy life...they want to, but they screw it up and then feel bad and then act out...a vicious circle.

110807,A3KDGJX43RU5MK,0790742799,D. W. MacKenzie,"[10, 10]","The Great Santini is a rare example of a film that aims to be every kind of film and succeeds. It is a hilarious comedy. The mushroom soup scene with Bull Meechum (Robert Duvall) can induce uncontrollable laughter. The `bare our souls' scene between Meechum and his eldest daughter is a classic. The `Private Toilet' scene is good for a few laughs as well.It is a deep drama. Marion (Blythe Danner) is caught up with Ben's (Michael O'Keefe) coming of age and Bull's aging to come. Mother, Son, and Father adjust to the changes that time brings to any family, and with great difficulty.It is a sentimental film. Ben's early wakening on his birthday shows a different side the character Duval portrays. The friendship between Ben and Tumor show sentimentality as well, as does Ben's final confrontation with Bull.It is a fair action film. The fighter plane scenes take a back seat, but the confrontation between Tumor and Red turns deadly. The action scenes make up a small part of this film, but they are an integral part.It is a penetrating tragedy as well. Ben learns to confront fear and death and comes to understand his father, but quite late. His growth is difficult and untimely.These elements come together to make a fair storyline into a grand film. The diverse elements of this film work together in a way that takes its' audience on a fascinating trip through the lives of a military family. The varying tone makes it all seem more real- the mood of the film changes from scene to scene, just as our moods change from day to day.Most importantly, Robert Duvall gives a fine performance. His character is by far the most important. The peculiarity of this man who goofs around with fellow Marines like he is at home and runs his private home like a barracks sets up all the comedy and much of the drama and sentimentality. The tragedy and action revolve around this as well.The combination of these elements into a single film was masterful. The acting and cinematography of this film matched the brilliance of its' production and choreography.

110809,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,0790742799,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[7, 7]","What made both the book and movie versions of this story, and with Conroy's other stories of Marine experiences, is that he presents both sides of the issues he talks about.  Most of the time you would think he's got it in bad for them, and that he would rather see the institution torn down.  But after awhile, criticisms aside, you see a genuine bonding and love also emerge from one who has experienced being part of the fraternity.In ""The Great Santini"" this is played to the hilt.  The film, which captures the book PERFECTLY, looks at the life of a Marine fighter pilot and his family from all sides.  The most entertaining ones, of course, are the wild antics Marines are famous for.  The opening scene, where Robert Duvall does creative things with a can of mushroom soup is priceless, and you see Marines as guys who work hard, but also expect to play hard as their reward.  In fact, I have a theory that part of the reason that guys are willing to put their lives on the line for their country LARGELY for the right to party their butts off as part of the reward.  Just a theory, but I've seen enough former military people to make a sound judgment on this.But the love/hate thing is shown best in a fairly simple domestic scene.  The tough-as-nails pilot, terrifically played by Duvall and based on Conroy's father, is playing basketball with a now grown son.  He has never lost a contest of any kind with his family, but in this one, the son prevails, despite repeated attempts at cheating by Duvall.  The father takes his defeat with as poor sportsmanship as possible, ruining the moment for everybody and verbally skewering the entire family.  An act as childish and unforgivable as you can imagine.  Right?Well, the scene afterward shows the dimension and depth of the movie.  While not exactly saying that what Duvall did was correct, the scene that follows at least tries to put him in a better light.  You see Duvall practicing basketball for hours in the pouring rain, while the mother explains to the son the meaning of this act.  You come away from it with a better understanding of the man after this scene.  After the movie is done, you feel the same way.  He may be an unforgivable pig much of the time, but he's our pig, and sometimes you have to accept the bad with the good.",5,The best Conroy book adaptation,1046649600,"03 3, 2003",2003,2301,"['What', 'made', 'book', 'movie', 'versions', 'story', 'Conroy', 'other', 'stories', 'Marine', 'experiences', 'sides', 'issues', 'about', 'Most', 'time', 'would', 'think', 'got', 'bad', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'institution', 'torn', 'down', 'awhile', 'criticisms', 'aside', 'see', 'genuine', 'bonding', 'love', 'also', 'emerge', 'one', 'who', 'experienced', 'being', 'part', 'fraternity.In', 'Great', 'Santini', 'played', 'hilt', 'film', 'book', 'PERFECTLY', 'life', 'Marine', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'family', 'sides', 'most', 'entertaining', 'ones', 'course', 'are', 'wild', 'antics', 'Marines', 'are', 'famous', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'creative', 'things', 'can', 'mushroom', 'soup', 'priceless', 'see', 'Marines', 'guys', 'who', 'work', 'hard', 'also', 'expect', 'play', 'hard', 'reward', 'fact', 'have', 'theory', 'part', 'reason', 'guys', 'are', 'willing', 'put', 'lives', 'line', 'country', 'LARGELY', 'right', 'party', 'butts', 'off', 'part', 'reward', 'Just', 'theory', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'former', 'military', 'people', 'make', 'sound', 'judgment', 'love/hate', 'thing', 'shown', 'best', 'fairly', 'simple', 'domestic', 'scene', 'tough-as-nails', 'pilot', 'terrifically', 'played', 'Duvall', 'based', 'Conroy', 'father', 'playing', 'basketball', 'now', 'grown', 'son', 'never', 'lost', 'contest', 'kind', 'family', 'one', 'son', 'repeated', 'attempts', 'cheating', 'Duvall', 'father', 'defeat', 'poor', 'sportsmanship', 'possible', 'ruining', 'moment', 'everybody', 'verbally', 'skewering', 'entire', 'family', 'act', 'childish', 'unforgivable', 'can', 'imagine', 'Right', 'Well', 'scene', 'afterward', 'dimension', 'depth', 'movie', 'not', 'exactly', 'saying', 'what', 'Duvall', 'did', 'was', 'correct', 'scene', 'least', 'tries', 'put', 'better', 'light', 'see', 'Duvall', 'practicing', 'basketball', 'hours', 'pouring', 'rain', 'mother', 'son', 'meaning', 'act', 'come', 'away', 'better', 'understanding', 'man', 'scene', 'movie', 'done', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'may', 'be', 'unforgivable', 'pig', 'much', 'time', 'pig', 'sometimes', 'have', 'accept', 'bad', 'good']",N/A

As the son of a career military man, I recognised some of the aspects of growing up in such an environment.  The constant moving, the impermanence of things, and the general competitiveness that comes with the atmosphere are very accurately portrayed.  Fortunately for me, my father was not the domineering Great Santini type!Robert Duvall plays a Marine Corps fighter pilot, one of the best of an elite corps, with an ego to match.  His name is 'Bull' Meechum, but he styles himself the 'Great Santini'.  Blythe Danner puts in an exquisite understated performance as the long-suffering yet loving wife, the strong and caring mother.  Michael O'Keefe had what was perhaps the best role of his career as the coming-of-age son, competing with his father yet yearning for love and approval.  Stan Shaw likewise turns in an excellent performance as Toomer, the black local who gets into trouble.  While many of the other supporting cast did not go on to great fame, it is certainly not due to lack of acting ability as shown in this film.Despite being nearly a quarter of a century old now, the film stands up to the passage of time.  The characters remain believable; the situations and cinematography bear up well.  The film has a timeless quality that qualifies it as a classic, and portrays both the military and southern experience realistically without distortion pro or con.The main drama is between Meechum and his son Ben, but the secondary plot lines are strong without distracting from the primary interaction.  The films ends in a strong, sombre mood, as the respect that has grudgingly built between father and son is finally realised, and the family dynamic continues its slow evolution as the family moves to yet another home at the end.The scene in which Ben, the son, finally beats Bull Meechum at basketball, at anything (Ben mentions it is the first time ANY of the children have beaten him at anything) is classic.  Both Duvall and O'Keefe give strong performances as their respective characters, Duvall the father who is at once proud of his son for succeeding and still angry at his own shortcomings, lashing out at the family, and Ben, who stands his ground to claim his victory, despite the taunting and pettiness of his father.The DVD version presents no special features to speak of ; it is essentially a video on disc.

Thank you Warner Archives!  It's interesting, but when I was stationed on the aircraft carrier USS Midway over in Yokosuka, Japan in the mid-1970's, I knew more than a few ""Bull Meechums"". The Midway had both Naval and Marine aviators, and when we'd stay in port, the ones who lived on shore housing with their families would often display a different side of their personalities. Some would ""turn off"" the military machismo with their wives and children...and some would not. ""Bull"" Meechum, as superbly portrayed by Robert Duvall, is one of the latter. His performance, along with those of Michael O'Keefe as his son Ben, Stan Shaw as Toomer Smalls and Blythe Danner as Lillian Meechum elevate this screen adaption of the semi-autobiographical novel by Pat Conroy to one of the Best Films of 1979.

The most ""dated"" and frankly unrealistic thing about the movie (and thus the greatest disappointment) was the actual portrayal of the Lt Col Meecham.  I'm not a military expert but after spending 4 years on a carrier and working with both Naval and Marine aviators, I know that there are some gungho folks out there but there are no goofballs.  Unfortunately, in this movie, Meecham comes off as a... goofball; a very bad stereotype that in the end does a disservice to the many intelligent and complex aviators out there.

110820,A1YVPBDG2OFMD2,0790742799,Leif Sheppard,"[0, 0]","Fair warning: this review contains spoilers, though there's truly very little to ""spoil"" concerning the film.An interesting sub-genre in the world of cinema is the dysfunctional family study, which typically focuses on a tyrannical father who (perhaps even unintentionally) wreaks havoc with the very people he purports to love. I'm certain all who have seen Criterion's recent release of 1956's""Bigger Than Life""know precisely how fascinating an expertly crafted entry in the dysfunctional family canon can be. ""The Great Santini"" is also a notable entry, this time focusing on hard-nosed military father Bull Meechum who rules his wife and four children with an iron fist. The film is primarily focused on Bull and oldest son Ben, with the remainder of the family serving as periphery characters.Ben constantly struggles under the pressure his father places upon his shoulders, whilst simultaneously striking up a friendship with Toomer, the stuttering son of the family maid. Toomer is masterfully portrayed by Stan Shaw, an underrated actor perhaps best known as Big George from""Fried Green Tomatoes"". The sub-plot involving his trials and tribulations is the most interesting thread within the film outside of the Meechum family itself.Robert Duvall commands the screen with his searing portrayal of Bull, all pressed slacks and unyielding machismo, who also harbors a cutting wit that filmgoers tend to expect from a career military officer. For example, this exchange:Bull: Colonel Hedgepath in, sergeant?Sergeant: No, sir.Bull: Where is he?Sergeant: He's indisposed at the moment, sir.Bull: I asked you where he was, not for your mastery of the English language, sergeant.The ""mushroom soup"" gag Meechum plays during the opening restaurant scenes as well as the accidental prank he perpetrates on an unsuspecting corporal (as well as Meecham's ridiculous explanation) provide much of the humor in the film. Aside from Duvall's nuanced performance, one of the highlights is the basketball scene, which not only served as great character development for Bull and his son, but through consummate production design also captured the very zeitgeist of a high school sporting event.""The Great Santini"" is loosely based upon the best selling memoir of the same name by Pat Conroy, who is perhaps best known for writing""The Prince of Tides"". But whereas Conroy's real life father died in 1998, his celluloid counterpart is tragically killed in a training accident in the penultimate scene. Therein lies the greatest problem with ""The Great Santini"". The script cobbled together sufficient melodrama with the devastatingly sad demise of Toomer, and adding Meechum's death to the mix diluted the aforementioned sub-plot and called into question the exact point of the piece.So, in many ways, ""The Great Santini"" was the""Crazy Heart""of 1979. The story is unabashedly hackneyed and just a tad overwrought, but the performances are so pitch perfect brilliant the viewer could care less about the inept screenwriting. There's no question that Robert Duvall and Michael O'Keefe truly earned their Oscar nods, but special mention must also be given to the understated performances of Blythe Danner as Bull's wife and Lisa Jane Persky as the amusingly sarcastic daughter. Indeed, the true joy of the film isn't simply to watch a stern military man learning to separate his family from the corps, it's in the interactions of a truly talented cast working with well-realized characters.Unfortunately, this is a film that never received a proper treatment on DVD. The only available version can be had cheaply enough, but it's contained in the much-maligned Warner Bros. cardboard snapcase and carries no extras whatsoever. Worse, the transfer is an ugly print replete with blemishes and scratches on the film and has no widescreen version. Why Warner didn't simply make the title a flipper disc with both widesceen and fullscreen is the greatest mystery of this release.Ultimately, ""The Great Santini"" is no classic of its genre and the DVD release leaves much to be desired, but it's still an entertaining film that's powered by a superbly talented cast. Whenever a remastered widescreen print of the film makes its way to Blu-Ray, I can easily imagine myself watching it again. That is, perhaps, the greatest compliment I can pay to ""The Great Santini"".Take care, sports fans.",4,"""The Great Santini""",1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,4367,"['Fair', 'warning', 'review', 'spoilers', 'truly', 'very', 'little', 'spoil', 'concerning', 'film.An', 'interesting', 'sub-genre', 'world', 'cinema', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'study', 'typically', 'tyrannical', 'father', 'who', 'perhaps', 'even', 'unintentionally', 'havoc', 'very', 'people', 'love', ""'m"", 'certain', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Criterion', 'recent', 'release', '1956', 'Bigger', 'Than', 'Life', 'know', 'precisely', 'how', 'fascinating', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'entry', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'canon', 'can', 'be', 'Great', 'Santini', 'also', 'notable', 'entry', 'time', 'focusing', 'hard-nosed', 'military', 'father', 'Bull', 'Meechum', 'who', 'rules', 'wife', 'four', 'children', 'iron', 'fist', 'film', 'primarily', 'focused', 'Bull', 'oldest', 'son', 'Ben', 'remainder', 'family', 'serving', 'periphery', 'characters.Ben', 'constantly', 'pressure', 'father', 'places', 'shoulders', 'whilst', 'simultaneously', 'striking', 'up', 'friendship', 'Toomer', 'stuttering', 'son', 'family', 'maid', 'Toomer', 'masterfully', 'portrayed', 'Stan', 'Shaw', 'underrated', 'actor', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'Big', 'George', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'most', 'interesting', 'thread', 'film', 'Meechum', 'family', 'itself.Robert', 'Duvall', 'screen', 'searing', 'portrayal', 'Bull', 'pressed', 'slacks', 'unyielding', 'machismo', 'who', 'also', 'cutting', 'wit', 'filmgoers', 'tend', 'expect', 'career', 'military', 'officer', 'example', 'exchange', 'Bull', 'Colonel', 'Hedgepath', 'sergeant', 'Sergeant', 'No', 'sir.Bull', 'Where', 'Sergeant', 'indisposed', 'moment', 'sir.Bull', 'asked', 'where', 'was', 'not', 'mastery', 'English', 'language', 'sergeant.The', 'mushroom', 'soup', 'gag', 'Meechum', 'opening', 'restaurant', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'accidental', 'prank', 'unsuspecting', 'corporal', 'as', 'well', 'Meecham', 'ridiculous', 'explanation', 'provide', 'much', 'humor', 'film', 'Aside', 'Duvall', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'one', 'highlights', 'basketball', 'scene', 'not', 'only', 'served', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'Bull', 'son', 'consummate', 'production', 'design', 'also', 'captured', 'very', 'zeitgeist', 'high', 'school', 'sporting', 'event', 'Great', 'Santini', 'loosely', 'based', 'best', 'selling', 'memoir', 'same', 'name', 'Pat', 'Conroy', 'who', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'writing', 'Prince', 'Tides', 'whereas', 'Conroy', 'real', 'life', 'father', 'died', '1998', 'celluloid', 'counterpart', 'tragically', 'killed', 'training', 'accident', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'Therein', 'greatest', 'problem', 'Great', 'Santini', 'script', 'cobbled', 'together', 'sufficient', 'melodrama', 'devastatingly', 'sad', 'demise', 'Toomer', 'adding', 'Meechum', 'death', 'mix', 'diluted', 'aforementioned', 'sub-plot', 'called', 'question', 'exact', 'point', 'piece.So', 'many', 'ways', 'Great', 'Santini', 'was', 'Crazy', 'Heart', '1979', 'story', 'unabashedly', 'hackneyed', 'just', 'tad', 'overwrought', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'brilliant', 'viewer', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'inept', 'screenwriting', 'question', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'truly', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nods', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'understated', 'performances', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'Bull', 'wife', 'Lisa', 'Jane', 'Persky', 'amusingly', 'sarcastic', 'daughter', 'Indeed', 'true', 'joy', 'film', ""n't"", 'simply', 'watch', 'stern', 'military', 'man', 'learning', 'separate', 'family', 'corps', 'interactions', 'truly', 'talented', 'cast', 'working', 'well-realized', 'characters.Unfortunately', 'film', 'never', 'received', 'proper', 'treatment', 'DVD', 'only', 'available', 'version', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'cheaply', 'enough', 'contained', 'much-maligned', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'cardboard', 'snapcase', 'extras', 'whatsoever', 'Worse', 'transfer', 'ugly', 'print', 'replete', 'blemishes', 'scratches', 'film', 'widescreen', 'version', 'Why', 'Warner', 'did', ""n't"", 'simply', 'make', 'title', 'flipper', 'disc', 'widesceen', 'fullscreen', 'greatest', 'mystery', 'release.Ultimately', 'Great', 'Santini', 'classic', 'genre', 'DVD', 'release', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'still', 'entertaining', 'film', 'powered', 'superbly', 'talented', 'cast', 'Whenever', 'remastered', 'widescreen', 'print', 'film', 'way', 'Blu-Ray', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'watching', 'again', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'compliment', 'can', 'pay', 'Great', 'Santini', '.Take', 'care', 'sports', 'fans']",N/A

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[0, 0]","Based on the Pat Conroy novel, this is one of my favorite Robert Duvall roles and my absolute favorite from Blythe Danner. Duvall is Wilbur &#34;Bull&#34; Meechum, a Marine fighter pilot - among the best at what he does...a true warrior...but a warrior w/out a war. His warrior persona is similar to some of the great warriors in our history - Patton comes to mind immediately - who do not function so well in peacetime. In spite of his skill as a fighter pilot and commander, he is only a LtCol Squadron Commander and his difficulties carry over into his personal life as he has a drinking problem and can only express love for his wife and four kids by using military command and control methods. Blythe Danner is the quintessential Southern Belle, as Meechum's wife; loving him and trying to control him...winning the fight sometimes, but often losing. As in the book, the film also explores the love/hate relationship between Meechum and his oldest son, Ben...played superbly by Michael O'Keefe. Conroy's novel is based on his own relationship with his father; so the love/hate relationship is central to the plot. Also look for superb performances from Lisa Jane Persky as the oldest Meechum daughter; Theresa Merritt as the family maid, Arabella Smalls; and Stan Shaw, as Toomer, Arabella's son and Ben's friend. The film is set and was filmed in Beaufort, SC and there is an ugly racial incident involving Toomer and a red-neck character, played by David Keith. The planes used by Meechum and the rest of the Marine pilots are F-4s and the simulated air warfare scenes are well staged and filmed. Great story, great performances...highly recommended. -",5,"""I am Santini.  The great Santini.

I always thought that Warner Brothers did a huge disservice to the film by retaining the original Pat Conroy book title (although the later re-release as ""the Ace"" also fails to inspire.) Despite the somewhat lackluster title, this is an absolutely superb film when viewed on many levels. I was originally interested in the film because of the aviation context, but that really only provides a medium for Robert Duvall to develop the character of Bull Meechum.The real story here revolves around family and interpersonal dynamics in an early 1960s military family. Duvall gives a stunning performance in the title role as a hard charging Marine fighter pilot who finds expressions of affection next to impossible. Although a PG rated film, the language and violence (there is no nudity) are not excessive and are only used when necessary to further the plot (largely in the anti-racism subplot.) Despite this some of the scenes are very difficult to watch as they hit very close to home for people familiar with difficult family situations. The scene where Michael O'Keefe beats Duvall in basketball is one of the all-time most amazing scenes in cinema.I think that the entire cast is perfect in every way. Stan Shaw gives an incredibly effective performance as Toomer in a subplot that addresses the futility of racism better than any other film I have ever seen. I find the scene of Red and Toomer with the bees and the dogs is one of the most poignant and brilliantly acted in history. The subtle complexity of the emotions (especially hatred and sorrow) in that one scene make the film worth watching, and should be required viewing in film schools everywhere. Likewise, Blythe Danner is amazing as the longsuffering military wife and mother.By far the most important component of the film is the family relationships within the Meechum family, and in particular the conflict between Duvall and O'Keefe. Both were nominated for Oscars for these roles, and I firmly believe that both should have won, as both give brilliant performances. Of the two, though, I actually think that O'Keefe does the better job in the exceptionally difficult role of the 18 year old son. The emotional range that O'Keefe demonstrates in this film put him in the league of truly great actors like Duvall. Every time I have seen this film I have come to admire O'Keefe's portrayal more.This is one of the best films from the 1970s and deserves more recognition than it has ever received. I give the film five stars (no question about that) although the Warner Brothers packaging leaves a lot to be desired. There are no commentary tracks or other extras on the DVD and that's a real shame. Nonetheless, this is a world class drama with occasionally brilliant comic insights that is as finely done as any other film I have ever seen.I highly recommend ""The Great Santini"" to everyone.",5,"Amazing Plot, Superb Script, And Sublime Acting From A Brilliant Cast",1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,2941,"['saw', 'Great', 'Santini', 'theatre', '1979', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'always', 'thought', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'did', 'huge', 'disservice', 'film', 'retaining', 'original', 'Pat', 'Conroy', 'book', 'title', 'later', 're-release', 'Ace', 'also', 'inspire', 'somewhat', 'lackluster', 'title', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'film', 'when', 'viewed', 'many', 'levels', 'was', 'originally', 'interested', 'film', 'aviation', 'context', 'really', 'only', 'medium', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'develop', 'character', 'Bull', 'Meechum.The', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'family', 'interpersonal', 'dynamics', 'early', '1960s', 'military', 'family', 'Duvall', 'stunning', 'performance', 'title', 'role', 'hard', 'charging', 'Marine', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'who', 'expressions', 'affection', 'impossible', 'PG', 'rated', 'film', 'language', 'violence', 'nudity', 'are', 'not', 'excessive', 'are', 'only', 'used', 'when', 'necessary', 'further', 'plot', 'largely', 'anti-racism', 'subplot', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'hit', 'very', 'close', 'home', 'people', 'familiar', 'difficult', 'family', 'situations', 'scene', 'where', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'Duvall', 'basketball', 'one', 'all-time', 'most', 'amazing', 'scenes', 'cinema.I', 'think', 'entire', 'cast', 'perfect', 'way', 'Stan', 'Shaw', 'incredibly', 'effective', 'performance', 'Toomer', 'subplot', 'futility', 'racism', 'better', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'find', 'scene', 'Red', 'Toomer', 'bees', 'dogs', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'history', 'subtle', 'complexity', 'emotions', 'especially', 'hatred', 'sorrow', 'one', 'scene', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'film', 'schools', 'everywhere', 'Likewise', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'amazing', 'longsuffering', 'military', 'wife', 'mother.By', 'far', 'most', 'important', 'component', 'film', 'family', 'relationships', 'Meechum', 'family', 'particular', 'conflict', 'Duvall', ""O'Keefe"", 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'roles', 'firmly', 'believe', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'give', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'two', 'actually', 'think', ""O'Keefe"", 'better', 'job', 'exceptionally', 'difficult', 'role', '18', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'emotional', 'range', ""O'Keefe"", 'film', 'put', 'league', 'truly', 'great', 'actors', 'Duvall', 'Every', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'admire', ""O'Keefe"", 'portrayal', 'more.This', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1970s', 'more', 'recognition', 'ever', 'received', 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'question', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'packaging', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'are', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'other', 'extras', 'DVD', 'real', 'shame', 'Nonetheless', 'world', 'class', 'drama', 'occasionally', 'brilliant', 'comic', 'insights', 'as', 'finely', 'done', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Great', 'Santini', 'everyone']",N/A

""The Great Santini"" is his name in the skies. Meacham is a Marine through and through. He loves military life and tries to instill that pride in his 3 children who are now getting old enough to think for themselves. Meacham is a bit of a showman, he is loud, brash, fiercely competitive and loves to call everyone ""sportsfan."" He has been a great leader all his life in the skies, with his men and with his family. But as he approaches the end of his career he is starting to face for the first time that soon this will no longer be the case. His greatest strengths are now becoming his shortcomings. The leash he has kept on his children is now growning too tight to fit and the older ones are growing anxious to get out from under his rule. His competitiveness turns ugly in a basketball game where he taunts his son. Scenes like this one are painful to watch and it first seems as if Santini is  petty and lacking a decent heart.  But looking closer we see a loving and good man whose nature does not allow any chinks to show in his armor but is facing his age and an approaching world where he can no longer control the things he used to control... including himself. Blythe Danner plays his lovely wife with tremendous grace, and southern charm. She alone truly understands him and does her best to uphold what he stands for and interpret his eccentricities to the children.Michael O'Keefe as the son Ben Meecham does a fantastic tightroping job balancing conflicting feelings of loving and hating his father and ultimately coming to terms with him. Their scenes together vary from being emotionally explosive to tender. There is a fine scene where Meacham wakes his son up in a haze on his 18th to pass on a special gift and tell him what it was like for him the day he was born . O'Keefe listens like a teen son, both being touched by the story and the gift without really knowing how to react to a father's need to share it at 4am. There are other great performances in the supporting cast as well. The daughter who humorously and unmercifully torments her father at breakfast about her inferior status as a female ""Meacham."" Theresa Merritt the new black maid who gets into a joyfully spontaneous shoulder punching contest with Bull. The maids son, with the strange name of Toomer (sounds like Tumor) who carries on a emotionally beneficial friendship with the son and a dramatic subplot dealing with a low brow racist that brings still more emotion and humanity into an already wonderful film.I was at first a little disappointed with the DVD in that it was not widescreen. But having watched the film I realize this is a film about people and not sprawling cinematography. It is in standard format but I never noticed any panning and scanning. The intensity of the film is in the center frame. And while I would have appreciated a better quality wide format print I would not hold off on buying this disc because of this. ...

His son finds himself having to protect his mother and siblings from his drunken father.It's a very well done, realistic film about officers who've embraced victory in battle, and then suddenly has to deal with a life of peace, but yet still sporting the military uniform and seeing a world where peace is taken for granted.And it does kinda have an unspoken, indirect approach to a happy ending. The ""psycho warmonger"" does die in the end so his tormented eldest son and the rest of the family can be set free from the living hell that he represented in the home.You've gotta appreciate the cast, which includes Blythe Danner as his wife, and Michael O'Keefe as his tormented son.If you like good military dramas, I recommend ""A Soldier's Story,"" and then ""Victory.""",4,I truly understand all the frustrations of everyone in this film,1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,1390,"['film', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'warmonger', 'army', 'officer', 'peacetime', 'how', 'family', 'fellow', 'officers', 'enlisted', 'men', 'drinker', 'getting', 'bored', 'new', 'base', 'assignment', 'right', 'away', 'mess', 'people', 'lower', 'rank', 'few', 'bad', 'decisions', 'coping', 'own', 'little', 'demons', 'enhanced', 'drinking', 'everyone', 'way', 'including', 'own', 'wife', 'family.The', 'one', 'most', 'tormented', 'oldest', 'son', 'who', 'just', 'becoming', '18', 'psycho-militant', 'father', 'shoving', 'military', 'commands', 'behaviors', 'down', 'throat', 'son', 'having', 'protect', 'mother', 'siblings', 'drunken', 'father.It', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'realistic', 'film', 'officers', 'who', ""'ve"", 'embraced', 'victory', 'battle', 'then', 'suddenly', 'deal', 'life', 'peace', 'yet', 'still', 'sporting', 'military', 'uniform', 'seeing', 'world', 'where', 'peace', 'taken', 'granted.And', 'kinda', 'have', 'unspoken', 'indirect', 'approach', 'happy', 'ending', 'psycho', 'warmonger', 'die', 'end', 'tormented', 'eldest', 'son', 'rest', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'set', 'free', 'living', 'hell', 'represented', 'home.You', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'appreciate', 'cast', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'wife', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'tormented', 'son.If', 'good', 'military', 'dramas', 'recommend', 'A', 'Soldier', 'Story', 'then', 'Victory']",N/A

Great movie.

110848,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0790742799,Wuchak,"[3, 3]","Two films were released in 1979, ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Great Santini,"" wherein Robert Duvall played essentially the same character -- a gung-ho, half-crazed Lieutenant Colonel in the Marine Corps.In ""The Great Santini"" Duvall plays fighter pilot commander Bull Meechum, who drives his family to his new base in Beaufort, SC (where the film was actually filmed). It's peace-time in the early 60s before the Vietnam War. Bull is ultra-charismatic but flawed. At any given time you either love him or hate him; you'll see this same struggle with his family members. He generally treats them like Marine subordinates which, for the most part, works and they seem to have a lot of good times together, but there's a darkside as Bull is overly competitive, especially with his just-turning-18 son Ben (Michael O'Keefe). Perhaps this is because he's a warrior without a war and he has to fight/win someone. He's also an alcoholic, albeit a functional one. The story details the family's good times and bad times.If you're in the mood for a good drama you can't go wrong with ""The Great Santini."" Although there are a few comedic moments, which are life-like in nature, this is essentially a serious study on the joys & agonies of family dynamics. The story offers numerous insights to ponder, which makes it a great film for repeat viewings.Many times during the film I was reminded of my growing-up years. In Bull Meechum I see a bit of my father.The one-on-one basketball game between Bull and his son is an exceptional scene. The rest of the family is watching and cheering. They're all having a fun time until it takes an unexpected dark turn. Bull can't handle losing to his son and responds like a total jerk. Yet it smacks of real life. Years ago I was playing chess with my wife on a Lake Erie beach and she beat me, which wasn't usual, and for some reason I got upset about it, perhaps because I wasn't in the best of moods to start with. Looking back, of course, I see how pathetic it was.Unlike Bull and Ben in the film I didn't have an actual relationship with my father. Generally, the only time he'd talk to me was when he was calling me names, cussing me out or telling me I was never going to amount to anything. One day, when I was 15 and my father was in his mid-50s, I was in my room upstairs and my dad started yelling at me from the bottom of the stairs. I couldn't really hear what he was saying and, mumbling, just kinda blew it off. He then ran up the stairs yelling and charged into my room in a rage. If he ever ran at me in such a manner in the past I would just flee the scene, but in this case I was cornered and had nowhere to run. Hence, we went at, the first and only time (physically), father against son. As great as his rage was, mine was greater. Don't get me wrong, I believe in honoring parents and all, but at that point I couldn't take anymore. I was done with the names, the cuss-outs and the deadly curses (e.g. ""You're gonna turn to $#!&""). I was able to put him in a headlock fairly quickly and squeezed tight until his entire head turned beet red. I then let him go and he walked out of the room muttering, defeated. And no wonder, he was in physical decline while I was just entering my prime. Strangely, in weeks and months to come he would brag on me about the incident.Why do I bring this personal story up? Because the film is so true-to-life that it will likely stir up growing-up memories for any adult viewer, pleasant and unpleasant, happy and sad.The eldest daughter, the redhead, is played by Lisa Jane Persky. She initially comes off as eccentric, geeky and not very attractive, but wait until you see her on prom night later in the picture. If I was 18 I'd take her out without a second thought. Anyway, go to imdb and check out a couple of recent pictures of her and witness what a truly beautiful woman she grew up to be.I should also point out that the film has a good, authentic Southern vibe like a handful of other films, e.g. ""Mississippi Burning,"" ""Ode To Billy Joe,"" ""Cat People"" (the remake) and even (believe it or not) ""Squirm.""There's so much more I could say about this picture, but I'll leave it for you to discover. Once again, if you're in the mood for a good drama you can't go wrong.PERSONAL GRADE: A-",5,"The agonies and ecstasies of family life, father v.s. son, etc.",1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,4275,"['Two', 'films', 'were', 'released', '1979', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Great', 'Santini', 'wherein', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'played', 'essentially', 'same', 'character', 'gung-ho', 'half-crazed', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Marine', 'Corps.In', 'Great', 'Santini', 'Duvall', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'commander', 'Bull', 'Meechum', 'who', 'family', 'new', 'base', 'Beaufort', 'SC', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'peace-time', 'early', '60s', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Bull', 'ultra-charismatic', 'flawed', 'given', 'time', 'love', 'hate', ""'ll"", 'see', 'same', 'struggle', 'family', 'members', 'generally', 'Marine', 'subordinates', 'most', 'part', 'works', 'seem', 'have', 'lot', 'good', 'times', 'together', 'darkside', 'Bull', 'overly', 'competitive', 'especially', 'just-turning-18', 'son', 'Ben', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'Perhaps', 'warrior', 'war', 'fight/win', 'someone', 'also', 'alcoholic', 'functional', 'one', 'story', 'details', 'family', 'good', 'times', 'bad', 'times.If', ""'re"", 'mood', 'good', 'drama', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Great', 'Santini', 'are', 'few', 'comedic', 'moments', 'are', 'life-like', 'nature', 'essentially', 'serious', 'study', 'joys', 'agonies', 'family', 'dynamics', 'story', 'numerous', 'insights', 'ponder', 'great', 'film', 'repeat', 'viewings.Many', 'times', 'film', 'was', 'reminded', 'growing-up', 'years', 'Bull', 'Meechum', 'see', 'bit', 'father.The', 'one-on-one', 'basketball', 'game', 'Bull', 'son', 'exceptional', 'scene', 'rest', 'family', 'watching', 'cheering', ""'re"", 'having', 'fun', 'time', 'unexpected', 'dark', 'turn', 'Bull', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'losing', 'son', 'responds', 'total', 'jerk', 'real', 'life', 'Years', 'was', 'playing', 'chess', 'wife', 'Lake', 'Erie', 'beach', 'beat', 'was', ""n't"", 'usual', 'reason', 'got', 'upset', 'perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'moods', 'start', 'Looking', 'back', 'course', 'see', 'how', 'pathetic', 'Bull', 'Ben', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'actual', 'relationship', 'father', 'Generally', 'only', 'time', ""'d"", 'talk', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'calling', 'names', 'cussing', 'telling', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'amount', 'anything', 'One', 'day', 'when', 'was', '15', 'father', 'was', 'mid-50s', 'was', 'room', 'upstairs', 'dad', 'started', 'yelling', 'bottom', 'stairs', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'hear', 'what', 'was', 'saying', 'mumbling', 'just', 'kinda', 'blew', 'off', 'then', 'ran', 'up', 'stairs', 'yelling', 'charged', 'room', 'rage', 'ever', 'ran', 'manner', 'past', 'would', 'just', 'flee', 'scene', 'case', 'was', 'cornered', 'had', 'nowhere', 'run', 'Hence', 'went', 'first', 'only', 'time', 'physically', 'father', 'son', 'As', 'great', 'rage', 'was', 'mine', 'was', 'greater', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'believe', 'honoring', 'parents', 'point', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'anymore', 'was', 'done', 'names', 'cuss-outs', 'deadly', 'curses', 'e.g', ""'re"", 'gon', 'turn', 'was', 'able', 'put', 'headlock', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'squeezed', 'tight', 'entire', 'head', 'turned', 'beet', 'red', 'then', 'let', 'go', 'walked', 'room', 'muttering', 'defeated', 'wonder', 'was', 'physical', 'decline', 'was', 'just', 'entering', 'prime', 'Strangely', 'weeks', 'months', 'come', 'would', 'brag', 'incident.Why', 'do', 'bring', 'personal', 'story', 'up', 'film', 'so', 'true-to-life', 'will', 'likely', 'stir', 'up', 'growing-up', 'memories', 'adult', 'viewer', 'pleasant', 'unpleasant', 'happy', 'sad.The', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'redhead', 'played', 'Lisa', 'Jane', 'Persky', 'initially', 'off', 'eccentric', 'geeky', 'not', 'very', 'attractive', 'wait', 'see', 'prom', 'night', 'later', 'picture', 'was', '18', ""'d"", 'take', 'out', 'second', 'thought', 'Anyway', 'go', 'imdb', 'check', 'out', 'couple', 'recent', 'pictures', 'witness', 'what', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'grew', 'up', 'be.I', 'should', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'film', 'good', 'authentic', 'Southern', 'vibe', 'handful', 'other', 'films', 'e.g', 'Mississippi', 'Burning', 'Ode', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'Cat', 'People', 'remake', 'even', 'believe', 'not', 'Squirm', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'say', 'picture', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'discover', 'Once', 'again', ""'re"", 'mood', 'good', 'drama', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong.PERSONAL', 'GRADE', 'A-']",N/A
