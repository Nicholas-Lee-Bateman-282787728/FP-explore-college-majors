All the ramifications of the extensive plot are laid out and followed through.  Balzac's major theme in most of his novels is central here: the huge importance of money, and the ways in which money determines relations within a famiy.  Margaret Tyzack is a bit over the top at times, but she is both villain and victim -- a loaded characterization which requires enormous range.

1031292,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B000K7UBVG,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[56, 57]","In the early 1970's I watched this Masterpiece Theater's presentation of ""Cousin Bette"" which is based on that wonderful novel ""Cousin Bette"" by the French author Balzac.  I can remember that this Masterpiece Theater production was considered by many very controversial mainly due to the sexual nature of the story (in fact, there were those that tried to cut-off the government funding to PBS because of this show); however, now, as then, I find it just very engrossing as is the novel.  Since the 1970's, I've desired for it to be released commercially.  Now, the powers that be, have finally released it on DVD.  I'm thrilled because it is a most wonderful presentation that is filled with fabulous performances by especially Margaret Tyzack as Cousin Bette and a very young Helen Mirren, as Valerie.In a ""tour de force"" performance, Margaret Tyzack is simply fabulous as the vengeful and supposedly homely Cousin Bette who is the poor relative to her, sort of, snooty but stupid cousins Mariette Hulot (played wonderfully by Margaret Boyd) and Celestine Hulot.  She always appears to appreciate her ""better off"" Cousins' tolerance (and ""cast offs"") towards her while, at the same time, she resents it like hell and wants to see them and the rest of her ""better off"" and stupid relatives in the preverbal gutter and in ruins. After suffering the extreme humiliation involving a handsome young art apprentice that she has rescued and has become very fond of and that her cousin Celestine, more or less, ""steals"" from her, she is out for their ""blood"" and wants to see them destroyed and by god she'll have her way no matter what or who is trampled on and/or killed.  Helen Mirren also turns in a `knock them dead"" performance, as Valerie who is young and cute and more than willing to use her ""sexuality"" to better herself and is very willing to be guided by Cousin Bette in her desire to ruin her dumb family. My understanding is that this role was at the very beginning of Mirren's career and obviously she has gone on to distinguish herself as one of today's leading actresses. Needless to say, Cousin Bette initially succeeds in destroying her family primarily because her cousin Mariette is married to Baron Hector Hulot a very stupid man  with a keen weakness and an excessively ""roving eye"" towards the very young and very pretty ladies--Valerie fits the aforesaid criteria and Cousin Bette uses her to get her vengeance.  My god Tyzack is good.  Just my thinking about her in this role, sends chills up and down my spine!  In fact, this presentation is filled with a lot of great acting.Don't expect the quality of the picture, production and the reincarnation of the era to be up to today's standards; it was ""state of the art"" for the 70s (very strange wigs and all).  Nevertheless, BBC has done a great job of bring it to the DVD format with very good sound and a very sharp and a clear picture.  Believe me, you'll soon forget that this is an old presentation because the acting by ALL will astound you--it really is a fantastic presentation.",5,FINALLY,1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,3056,"['early', '1970', 'watched', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'presentation', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'based', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'French', 'author', 'Balzac', 'can', 'remember', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'production', 'was', 'considered', 'many', 'very', 'controversial', 'mainly', 'due', 'sexual', 'nature', 'story', 'fact', 'were', 'tried', 'cut-off', 'government', 'funding', 'PBS', 'show', 'however', 'now', 'then', 'find', 'just', 'very', 'engrossing', 'novel', '1970', ""'ve"", 'desired', 'be', 'released', 'commercially', 'Now', 'powers', 'be', 'have', 'finally', 'released', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'most', 'wonderful', 'presentation', 'filled', 'fabulous', 'performances', 'especially', 'Margaret', 'Tyzack', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'very', 'young', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Valerie.In', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'Margaret', 'Tyzack', 'simply', 'fabulous', 'vengeful', 'supposedly', 'homely', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'who', 'poor', 'relative', 'sort', 'snooty', 'stupid', 'cousins', 'Mariette', 'Hulot', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Margaret', 'Boyd', 'Celestine', 'Hulot', 'always', 'appreciate', 'better', 'off', 'Cousins', 'tolerance', 'cast', 'offs', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'hell', 'see', 'rest', 'better', 'off', 'stupid', 'relatives', 'preverbal', 'gutter', 'ruins', 'suffering', 'extreme', 'humiliation', 'involving', 'handsome', 'young', 'art', 'apprentice', 'rescued', 'become', 'very', 'fond', 'cousin', 'Celestine', 'more', 'less', 'steals', 'out', 'blood', 'see', 'destroyed', 'god', ""'ll"", 'have', 'way', 'matter', 'what', 'who', 'trampled', 'and/or', 'killed', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'also', 'knock', 'dead', 'performance', 'Valerie', 'who', 'young', 'cute', 'more', 'willing', 'use', 'sexuality', 'better', 'very', 'willing', 'be', 'guided', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'desire', 'ruin', 'dumb', 'family', 'understanding', 'role', 'was', 'very', 'beginning', 'Mirren', 'career', 'obviously', 'gone', 'distinguish', 'one', 'today', 'leading', 'actresses', 'Needless', 'say', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'initially', 'destroying', 'family', 'primarily', 'cousin', 'Mariette', 'married', 'Baron', 'Hector', 'Hulot', 'very', 'stupid', 'man', 'keen', 'weakness', 'excessively', 'roving', 'eye', 'very', 'young', 'very', 'pretty', 'ladies', 'Valerie', 'aforesaid', 'criteria', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'get', 'vengeance', 'My', 'god', 'Tyzack', 'good', 'Just', 'thinking', 'role', 'chills', 'up', 'spine', 'fact', 'presentation', 'filled', 'lot', 'great', 'acting.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'quality', 'picture', 'production', 'reincarnation', 'era', 'be', 'up', 'today', 'standards', 'was', 'state', 'art', '70s', 'very', 'strange', 'wigs', 'Nevertheless', 'BBC', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'bring', 'DVD', 'format', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'very', 'sharp', 'clear', 'picture', 'Believe', ""'ll"", 'soon', 'forget', 'old', 'presentation', 'acting', 'ALL', 'will', 'astound', 'really', 'fantastic', 'presentation']",Cousin Bette

1031296,A2A2SUY3IOQKY1,B000K7UBVG,TawnTawn,"[0, 1]","I got this from the library. If you haven't seen it yet, don't read, as this review contains spoilers. The sets were rather claustrophobic, as if no one ever went outside.  Even the outside sets were obviously sets.I thought this was a rather funny miniseries.  I really couldn't take it seriously.  The characters are in Paris, yet only one person has a French accent.  Some of the courtesans even have Cockney accents. Cousin Bette is the poor relation all her life for some reason, even though she and her cousin Adeline were raised together as orphans.  Adeline got everything, Bette got to do the drudge work.  Now Bette is middle-aged (or older) and has discovered a young man who might make it as a sculptor, Wenceslas.  She invests her savings in him (she has savings even though she's poor), and this goes on for several years.  Then in an attempt to prove this sculptor's existence and win a yellow scarf from her cousin's daughter, Hortense, she unwittingly brings him into their midst...when she finds out Wenceslas and Hortense are engaged (behind her back! they have stolen him from her!) she blows a gasket.  Which is understandable.  She didn't seem to be in love with him, but he was something that she had all her own.  Now the ""rich"" relatives have stolen even that from her.  However, her young neighbor, Valerie Marneffe, tells her to simply turn things around to her liking, start using people, etc. Cousin Bette does, with a vengeance.This is where the story becomes very unrealistic.  Would this woman, at this age, suddenly know how to play games with peoples' lives and get her way every time? NO.  Yet, she is suddenly an expert. Valerie, who has been married for several years and has a child, living with his grandmother (whose mother?), also at around this same time, suddenly begins to attract and manipulate every man she meets.  Her own husband doesn't want her, yet gorgeous Brazilians and rich Parisians who could have anybody are dying to get with her...and even though they are many times all in the same room together, they NEVER know that she is sleeping with ALL of them.  Yeah, right. When she supposedly gets pregnant, Cousin Bette gets two of the rich ones to put a bunch of francs in Valerie's name, for the coming child.  Now, nobody is that stupid.  They would wait until the baby was born, at least.  Of course, Valerie ""miscarries,"" but keeps all the money. Valerie, played by Helen Mirren (she looks like a baby!) is cute, but that's about it.  Yet all men are putty in her hands.One of the men, Hector Hulot, is the husband of Adeline, and supposedly going broke, yet he always has money to give Valerie. He even has money to set her up in her own house, even though he did not have enough money for that for his previous mistress.  He is also somehow high up in the French government, but how?  He is a complete simpleton. Also, the bottom of his feet, as he lies on Valerie's bed, are black with dirt!Cousin Bette is pure evil and full of hatred - but there is not enough reason for it.  She hates her Uncle Fischer for no other reason (that I could find stated) than that she thinks he is stupid.  She talks Hulot into sending him to Algeria.  None of these people are too good at thinking for themselves.  So it's really a wonder they made it this far in life without Cousin Bette telling them what to do and when to do it.  Suddenly, they believe she is an oracle, though before she was just a joke.Most people in this miniseries have terrible, ridiculous hair. To where I just looked at their hair instead of their faces. Towards the end, I couldn't buy that Valerie would leave all her money to Hulot. What about her son?For something to watch, it was okay, it was entertaining, but the story was simplistic and full of holes.",3,Funny in Parts,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,3783,"['got', 'library', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'review', 'spoilers', 'sets', 'were', 'rather', 'claustrophobic', 'one', 'ever', 'went', 'Even', 'outside', 'sets', 'were', 'obviously', 'sets.I', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'funny', 'miniseries', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'characters', 'are', 'Paris', 'yet', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'French', 'accent', 'courtesans', 'even', 'have', 'Cockney', 'accents', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'poor', 'relation', 'life', 'reason', 'even', 'cousin', 'Adeline', 'were', 'raised', 'together', 'orphans', 'Adeline', 'got', 'everything', 'Bette', 'got', 'do', 'drudge', 'work', 'Now', 'Bette', 'middle-aged', 'older', 'discovered', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'might', 'make', 'sculptor', 'Wenceslas', 'savings', 'savings', 'even', 'poor', 'several', 'years', 'Then', 'attempt', 'prove', 'sculptor', 'existence', 'win', 'yellow', 'scarf', 'cousin', 'daughter', 'Hortense', 'unwittingly', 'midst', 'when', 'out', 'Wenceslas', 'Hortense', 'are', 'engaged', 'back', 'have', 'stolen', 'gasket', 'Which', 'understandable', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'love', 'was', 'something', 'had', 'own', 'Now', 'rich', 'relatives', 'have', 'stolen', 'even', 'However', 'young', 'neighbor', 'Valerie', 'Marneffe', 'simply', 'turn', 'things', 'liking', 'start', 'using', 'people', 'etc', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'vengeance.This', 'where', 'story', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'Would', 'woman', 'age', 'suddenly', 'know', 'how', 'play', 'games', 'peoples', 'lives', 'get', 'way', 'time', 'NO', 'suddenly', 'expert', 'Valerie', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'several', 'years', 'child', 'living', 'grandmother', 'mother', 'also', 'same', 'time', 'suddenly', 'attract', 'manipulate', 'man', 'own', 'husband', ""n't"", 'want', 'yet', 'gorgeous', 'Brazilians', 'rich', 'Parisians', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'anybody', 'are', 'dying', 'get', 'even', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'same', 'room', 'together', 'NEVER', 'know', 'sleeping', 'ALL', 'Yeah', 'right', 'When', 'supposedly', 'pregnant', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'two', 'rich', 'ones', 'put', 'bunch', 'francs', 'Valerie', 'name', 'coming', 'child', 'Now', 'nobody', 'stupid', 'would', 'wait', 'baby', 'was', 'born', 'least', 'course', 'Valerie', 'miscarries', 'money', 'Valerie', 'played', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'baby', 'cute', 'men', 'are', 'putty', 'hands.One', 'men', 'Hector', 'Hulot', 'husband', 'Adeline', 'supposedly', 'going', 'broke', 'yet', 'always', 'money', 'give', 'Valerie', 'even', 'money', 'set', 'up', 'own', 'house', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'previous', 'mistress', 'also', 'somehow', 'high', 'up', 'French', 'government', 'how', 'complete', 'simpleton', 'Also', 'bottom', 'feet', 'Valerie', 'bed', 'are', 'black', 'dirt', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'pure', 'evil', 'full', 'hatred', 'not', 'enough', 'reason', 'Uncle', 'Fischer', 'other', 'reason', 'could', 'find', 'stated', 'stupid', 'Hulot', 'sending', 'Algeria', 'None', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'good', 'thinking', 'really', 'wonder', 'made', 'far', 'life', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'telling', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'do', 'Suddenly', 'believe', 'oracle', 'was', 'just', 'joke.Most', 'people', 'miniseries', 'have', 'terrible', 'ridiculous', 'hair', 'where', 'just', 'looked', 'hair', 'instead', 'end', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Valerie', 'would', 'leave', 'money', 'Hulot', 'What', 'son', 'something', 'watch', 'was', 'okay', 'was', 'entertaining', 'story', 'was', 'simplistic', 'full', 'holes']",Cousin Bette
