205433,A396SBGKAOLTZE,6300184919,Chris Aldridge,"[5, 5]","""The Thrill Of It All"" was one of my favorite childhood memories. In the days prior to wall-to-wall cable stations, there were certain films that enjoyed a regular place on the weekend matinee lineup on local TV stations. This was one of them. And the funny thing is when I originally saw it, I never thought of it as dated or sexist (this is a memory from about 28 years ago). Even though I grew up in a household where both my parents worked (and my dad never gave it a second thought since there were six of us), I merely accepted the script as a reflection of the 1963 sensibility and not my own. You really can't watch a movie that's older than you are (I'm guessing lots of you are waaay under 40) and expect it to reflect modern-day sensibilities. That said, the film is expertly written taking several stabs and jabs at the TV advertising (as well as the network) industry. Doris Day was the quintessential (and exquisitely beautiful) screen wife and mother, and James Garner was a perfect spousal foil for her. And what you had from Arlene ""What's My Line"" Francis was a welcome touch of class in the role of a mature expectant mother (heady stuff for 1963!) along with nervous expectant father Edward Andrews.

205437,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,6300184919,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[10, 11]","A hip and happening Doris Day comedy in which the girl next door becomes a media sensation.  Doris stars, not surprisingly, as a wholesomely sexy suburban housewife who is hired to become the spokesperson for the Happy Soap company, because Happy Soap's crotchety old president finds her stammering, unprofessional endorsements to be refreshingly honest and -- more importantly -- so does the soap-buying public.  In fact, the only one who doesn't like her ascent into the media is her grouchy, fragile-egoed husband (played by James Garner), who can't stand the thought of his own wife having a job -- it's just too much of a blow to his masculinity, and besides, who will raise the kids if mommy goes to work?  The depth and sheer matter-of-factness to the sexism in this pre-women's movement comedy will be both astounding and instructive to a modern audience, but besides all that, it's also a great vehicle for Day's bubbly, frowsy charm.  Garner's character is a bit hysterical, but it's all worth it for the big payoff: his double-take during the swimming pool scene is a golden comedic moment.  Scriptwriter Carl Reiner's touch is easy to pick out; Reiner also has some choice cameos as a hammy TV actor on the show that Happy Soap sponsors.

205440,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300184919,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 6]","It's no coincidence that this 1963 Doris Day comedy is among one of her smarter concoctions since it has such a strong pedigree - Norman Jewison directed, and the screenwriters were Larry Gelbart and Carl Reiner. In fact, there are traces of Reiner's smart-funny ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" in the domestic scenes here with Day and James Garner playing a credible, attractive suburban couple. The fact that the film seems rather chauvinist today just adds to its now rather antiquated charm, as the story revolves around the aptly named Beverly Boyer, a housewife who gets hired as a TV commercial pitchwoman for a soap company much to the chagrin of her obstetrician husband who wants her home with the kids. This concept is tethered to the contrived notion that a fiftyish woman (played by the always sophisticated Arlene Francis) is pregnant, Garner is her dutiful doctor, and her aged father is the blustery founder of the soap company who loves Beverly's homey way of talking about her children.It's somewhat ironic that Day, who epitomized the mid-century working woman in ""Teacher's Pet"", ""Pillow Talk"" and ""Lover Come Back"", would be playing such an ordinary domestic role here, but I still believe she is among the most underrated of screen actresses. She parlays her underlying intelligence and down-to-earth sensibilities into such likable characters that she makes the silly faux-real Happy Soap commercials quite amusing. Look at the contrived performance of Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in the atrociously over-the-top ""Down With Love"" as a valid point of comparison. A young, granite-jawed Garner is solid though on the dull side as her frustrated husband who tires of his wife's growing celebrity. Unlike Day's forays with Rock Hudson, this one places Garner's character in a more decidedly secondary role. The funniest scenes relate to the still-sharp jabs at the 1960's Madison Avenue advertising mindset, comparing favorably to Day's other anti-advertising satire, ""Lover Come Back"".  It all ends predictably with Edward Andrews the comic standout as Francis' frantic husband. Definitely one of Day's better films.",4,"Day, Reiner, Gelbart and Jewison Sharpen Advertising Satire",1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,2124,"['coincidence', '1963', 'Doris', 'Day', 'comedy', 'one', 'smarter', 'concoctions', 'strong', 'pedigree', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'directed', 'screenwriters', 'were', 'Larry', 'Gelbart', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'fact', 'are', 'traces', 'Reiner', 'smart-funny', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Show', 'domestic', 'scenes', 'here', 'Day', 'James', 'Garner', 'playing', 'credible', 'attractive', 'suburban', 'couple', 'fact', 'film', 'rather', 'chauvinist', 'today', 'just', 'now', 'rather', 'antiquated', 'charm', 'story', 'aptly', 'named', 'Beverly', 'Boyer', 'housewife', 'who', 'hired', 'TV', 'commercial', 'pitchwoman', 'soap', 'company', 'much', 'chagrin', 'obstetrician', 'husband', 'who', 'home', 'kids', 'concept', 'tethered', 'contrived', 'notion', 'fiftyish', 'woman', 'played', 'always', 'sophisticated', 'Arlene', 'Francis', 'pregnant', 'Garner', 'dutiful', 'doctor', 'aged', 'father', 'blustery', 'founder', 'soap', 'company', 'who', 'Beverly', 'homey', 'way', 'talking', 'children.It', 'somewhat', 'ironic', 'Day', 'who', 'epitomized', 'mid-century', 'working', 'woman', 'Teacher', 'Pet', 'Pillow', 'Talk', 'Lover', 'Come', 'Back', 'would', 'be', 'playing', 'such', 'ordinary', 'domestic', 'role', 'here', 'still', 'believe', 'most', 'underrated', 'screen', 'actresses', 'underlying', 'intelligence', 'down-to-earth', 'sensibilities', 'such', 'likable', 'characters', 'silly', 'faux-real', 'Happy', 'Soap', 'commercials', 'quite', 'amusing', 'Look', 'contrived', 'performance', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'atrociously', 'over-the-top', 'Love', 'valid', 'point', 'comparison', 'young', 'granite-jawed', 'Garner', 'solid', 'dull', 'side', 'frustrated', 'husband', 'who', 'wife', 'growing', 'celebrity', 'Day', 'forays', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'one', 'Garner', 'character', 'more', 'decidedly', 'secondary', 'role', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'relate', 'still-sharp', 'jabs', '1960', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'advertising', 'mindset', 'comparing', 'favorably', 'Day', 'other', 'anti-advertising', 'satire', 'Lover', 'Come', 'Back', 'predictably', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'comic', 'standout', 'Francis', 'frantic', 'husband', 'Definitely', 'one', 'Day', 'better', 'films']",N/A

205442,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6300184919,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 5]","Doris Day was one of the top ten box office draws in the world throughout the late 1950s and much of the 1960s.  Although she was as gifted with a dramatic role as she was with comedy, it is for the latter that she is best recalled--and where Day was concerned such comedies usually relied on a mixture of romantic and screwball comedy levened with a fair amount of farce and plenty of pratfalls.  When the movies were good, they were very good, with PILLOW TALK and PLEASE DON'T EAT THE DAISIES case in point--and Day's personal charm it often made up for such weaker scripts as DO NOT DISTURB and CAPRICE.The latter is certainly the case with THE THRILL OF IT ALL, which ranks well down the scale from PILLOW TALK but considerably ahead of such truly awful movies as THE BALLAD OF JOSIE and WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT.  In this particular outing, Day plays Beverly Boyer, married to a successful doctor (James Garner), a stay-at-home wife and mother with an upscale home, hired help, and everything a woman was expected to want or desire from the world at this particular time in American history.  But disaster lies in store, and it comes in an unlikely manner.Her husband has helped a patient (Arlene Francis) conceive; the patient's husband (Edward Andrews) owns a soap company; and when Beverly in all innocence praises the product she is hired to become the product's spokesperson.  Although she is at first clumsy, the public likes her--and the next thing she knows she is in hot demand for television commercials, photo shoots, and all the rest.  Not only has she no time for her family, she has also committed the unpardonable sin of earning more money than her husband.Needless to say, the ideas that drive the plot are extremely dated, but very often this dated quality is part of a film's charm.  But that really isn't the case here.  The simple fact is that, although the film collects considerable talent, it never seems to entirely gel.  Day is always very entertaining to watch, but James Garner is very much second-fiddle and in many ways reads as unsympathetic in his performance--which is very, very much ""second fiddle"" to Day.  Ultimately, the highlight of the movie are Arlene Francis and Edward Andrews and the legendary Zasu Pitts in the small role of Day's household help.The film works best when it plays for broadslap stick, and in these scenes it is truly laugh-out-loud funny, but on the whole the script just doesn't really support the cast between bouts of hilarity, and everything else seems slightly forced.  The DVD offers a good transfer, but there are no significant bonus materials.  Recommened, but only just, and pretty much for viewers who already Day fans to begin with.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,The Thrill Is Gone,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,2745,"['Doris', 'Day', 'was', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'box', 'office', 'draws', 'world', 'late', '1950s', 'much', '1960s', 'was', 'gifted', 'dramatic', 'role', 'was', 'comedy', 'latter', 'best', 'recalled', 'where', 'Day', 'was', 'concerned', 'such', 'comedies', 'usually', 'relied', 'mixture', 'romantic', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'levened', 'fair', 'amount', 'farce', 'plenty', 'pratfalls', 'When', 'movies', 'were', 'good', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'PILLOW', 'TALK', 'PLEASE', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'EAT', 'THE', 'DAISIES', 'case', 'point', 'Day', 'personal', 'charm', 'often', 'made', 'up', 'such', 'weaker', 'scripts', 'DO', 'NOT', 'DISTURB', 'CAPRICE.The', 'latter', 'certainly', 'case', 'THE', 'THRILL', 'IT', 'ALL', 'well', 'down', 'scale', 'PILLOW', 'TALK', 'considerably', 'ahead', 'such', 'truly', 'awful', 'movies', 'THE', 'BALLAD', 'OF', 'JOSIE', 'WHERE', 'WERE', 'YOU', 'WHEN', 'THE', 'LIGHTS', 'WENT', 'OUT', 'particular', 'outing', 'Day', 'Beverly', 'Boyer', 'married', 'successful', 'doctor', 'James', 'Garner', 'stay-at-home', 'wife', 'mother', 'upscale', 'home', 'hired', 'help', 'everything', 'woman', 'was', 'expected', 'want', 'desire', 'world', 'particular', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'disaster', 'lies', 'store', 'unlikely', 'manner.Her', 'husband', 'helped', 'patient', 'Arlene', 'Francis', 'conceive', 'patient', 'husband', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'soap', 'company', 'when', 'Beverly', 'innocence', 'product', 'hired', 'become', 'product', 'spokesperson', 'first', 'clumsy', 'public', 'next', 'thing', 'hot', 'demand', 'television', 'commercials', 'photo', 'shoots', 'rest', 'Not', 'only', 'time', 'family', 'also', 'committed', 'unpardonable', 'sin', 'earning', 'more', 'money', 'husband.Needless', 'say', 'ideas', 'drive', 'plot', 'are', 'extremely', 'dated', 'very', 'often', 'dated', 'quality', 'part', 'film', 'charm', 'really', ""n't"", 'case', 'here', 'simple', 'fact', 'film', 'considerable', 'talent', 'never', 'entirely', 'gel', 'Day', 'always', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'James', 'Garner', 'very', 'much', 'second-fiddle', 'many', 'ways', 'reads', 'unsympathetic', 'performance', 'very', 'very', 'much', 'second', 'fiddle', 'Day', 'Ultimately', 'highlight', 'movie', 'are', 'Arlene', 'Francis', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'legendary', 'Zasu', 'Pitts', 'small', 'role', 'Day', 'household', 'help.The', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'broadslap', 'stick', 'scenes', 'truly', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'whole', 'script', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'support', 'cast', 'bouts', 'hilarity', 'everything', 'else', 'slightly', 'forced', 'DVD', 'good', 'transfer', 'are', 'significant', 'bonus', 'materials', 'Recommened', 'only', 'just', 'pretty', 'much', 'viewers', 'who', 'already', 'Day', 'fans', 'begin', 'with.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

It's directed by Norman Jewison. The supporting cast is more than able. It's produced by Ross Hunter & Martin Melcher (husband to Ms. Day). With this assemblage of talent one would expect a killer movie. Day & Garner were superb in comedic roles & no less so than here. But the whole thing is lacking SOMETHING! It reminds me of putting together a sports team; you get some of the best talent available, put them together on the field yet the team doesn't gel, i.e., the chemistry is missing.Dr. Gerald Boyer (James Garner) is a successful obstetrician, his practice is thriving. He lives in an expensive home, drives a great car, his family lacks for nothing, they even have a live-in housekeeper. Beverly Boyer (Doris Day) is a loving wife that doesn't have to work. Then, by accident when attending a house dinner at one of Dr. Boyer's patients, Mrs. Boyer gives a testimonial about Happy Soap & how their two children adored it. The Fraleighs (the family who's invited them to dinner) include Mrs. Fraleigh (Arlene Francis), Gardiner Fraliegh (Edward Andrews) & the patriarch of the family, Tom Fraleigh (reginald Owens). Lo & behold it's the Fraleighs that own the Happy Soap company & they're big into TV advertising & sponsor their own program that includes live commercials (yes, folks, they did things like that in the old days). The elder Fraleigh is so impressed with Beverly's sincerity about Happy Soap that he wants to hire her as their tv spokesperson.Of course she's hesitant when offered the job until she's told they will pay her $80,000 a year.This all leads to marital complications because Dr. Boyer is an old fashioned husband & thinks Beverly should stay home. Once Beverly takes the job they rarely get to spend quality time together. Dr. Boyer even pretends to have an extramarital affair & a drinking problem in order to make his wife jealous. It all ends in a climactic & hectic finale where everyone has to get to the hospital on time in order to deliver Mrs. Fraleigh' baby. It's a little silly & forced but everything works out fine in the end.The audio & video are great & there are sub-titles, there is the original movie trailer.

205471,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,6300184919,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[4, 6]","Director Norman Jewison is known for directing ""The Russians are Coming, The Russians Are Coming"" (1966), ""In The Heat of the Night"" (1967) and ""Fiddler on the Roof"" (1971), to name a few.  Before those films, he directed his second feature film, ""The Thrill of it All"", in 1963.  Co-written by Larry Gelbart and Carl Reiner, the film is a comedic tale about an ordinary housewife, Beverly Boyer (Doris Day), who becomes an advertising icon for a fictitious soap that is named ""Happy Soap"".  This transformation occurs following a dinner party attended by her and her husband, Dr. Gerald Boyer (James Garner), where she makes several honest and sincere comments about Happy Soap.  Also attending the dinner party were the company's owners: Old Tom Fraleigh (Reginald Owen, better known as Admiral Boom in the 1964 film ""Mary Poppins"") and his son Gardiner Fraleigh (Edward Andrews).  Initially, Beverly is asked to only appear in a single TV commercial, but the number of responses received encourages Tom Fraleigh to offer Beverly a long-term advertising contract.  Beverly accepts, and begins making more TV commercials and her picture begins to appear on billboards everywhere.  As time passes, life in and out of the Boyer home becomes increasingly disrupted with Beverly's rise to stardom prompting Gerald to become jealous of her success.  He wants Beverly to return to being an ordinary housewife, but she basks in her newfound success and freedom.Other characters who add to the delight of this film include the Boyer's two young children: Maggie Boyer (Kym Karath, better known as Gretl von Trapp in the 1965 hit ""The Sound of Music"") and Andy Boyer (Brian Nash, better known as Joel Nash in the short-lived 1965 TV series ""Please Don't Eat the Daisies"").  As Beverly becomes too busy to be with their children, the Boyers hire a German housekeeper/nanny, Mrs. Goethe (Lucy Landau), whose lack of English fluency creates several funny moments in the film.  Two of the funniest scenes in the film are when Gerald accidentally drives his car into a swimming pool (built in the Boyer's backyard at the behest of Happy Soap) and when Gerald delivers a couple's baby during a traffic jam.  Zasu Pitts makes a brief appearance in the film; she died the same year the film was released.  Carl Reiner also makes a cameo appearance dressed as a German soldier.Some who watch ""The Thrill of it All"" may regard its humor and story somewhat dated since very few women in the U.S. are housewives today.  However, there may still be many married men jealous of their more successful wives.  ""The Thrill of it All"" is not a perfect film, but it is still a very entertaining and well-acted comedy that continues to make many people laugh.  Overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  Writer Larry Gelbart went on to write and produce the long-running TV series ""M*A*S*H"" (1972-1983), and Carl Reiner went on to direct films such as ""Oh, God!"" (1977) and ""The Jerk"" (1979).",4,1960's Comedy About A Housewife Turned Advertising Icon,1048723200,"03 27, 2003",2003,2994,"['Director', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'known', 'directing', 'Russians', 'are', 'Coming', 'Russians', 'Are', 'Coming', '1966', 'Heat', 'Night', '1967', 'Fiddler', 'Roof', '1971', 'name', 'few', 'films', 'directed', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'Thrill', 'All', '1963', 'Co-written', 'Larry', 'Gelbart', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'film', 'comedic', 'tale', 'ordinary', 'housewife', 'Beverly', 'Boyer', 'Doris', 'Day', 'who', 'advertising', 'icon', 'fictitious', 'soap', 'named', 'Happy', 'Soap', 'transformation', 'following', 'dinner', 'party', 'attended', 'husband', 'Dr.', 'Gerald', 'Boyer', 'James', 'Garner', 'where', 'several', 'honest', 'sincere', 'comments', 'Happy', 'Soap', 'Also', 'attending', 'dinner', 'party', 'were', 'company', 'owners', 'Old', 'Tom', 'Fraleigh', 'Reginald', 'Owen', 'better', 'known', 'Admiral', 'Boom', '1964', 'film', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'son', 'Gardiner', 'Fraleigh', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'Initially', 'Beverly', 'asked', 'only', 'appear', 'single', 'TV', 'commercial', 'number', 'responses', 'received', 'encourages', 'Tom', 'Fraleigh', 'offer', 'Beverly', 'long-term', 'advertising', 'contract', 'Beverly', 'accepts', 'making', 'more', 'TV', 'commercials', 'picture', 'appear', 'billboards', 'everywhere', 'time', 'passes', 'life', 'Boyer', 'home', 'increasingly', 'disrupted', 'Beverly', 'rise', 'stardom', 'prompting', 'Gerald', 'become', 'jealous', 'success', 'Beverly', 'return', 'being', 'ordinary', 'housewife', 'newfound', 'success', 'freedom.Other', 'characters', 'who', 'add', 'delight', 'film', 'include', 'Boyer', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'Maggie', 'Boyer', 'Kym', 'Karath', 'better', 'known', 'Gretl', 'von', 'Trapp', '1965', 'hit', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Andy', 'Boyer', 'Brian', 'Nash', 'better', 'known', 'Joel', 'Nash', 'short-lived', '1965', 'TV', 'series', 'Please', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Eat', 'Daisies', 'Beverly', 'too', 'busy', 'be', 'children', 'Boyers', 'hire', 'German', 'housekeeper/nanny', 'Mrs.', 'Goethe', 'Lucy', 'Landau', 'lack', 'English', 'fluency', 'several', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'Two', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'Gerald', 'accidentally', 'car', 'swimming', 'pool', 'built', 'Boyer', 'backyard', 'behest', 'Happy', 'Soap', 'when', 'Gerald', 'couple', 'baby', 'traffic', 'jam', 'Zasu', 'Pitts', 'brief', 'appearance', 'film', 'died', 'same', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'also', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'dressed', 'German', 'soldier.Some', 'who', 'watch', 'Thrill', 'may', 'regard', 'humor', 'story', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'very', 'few', 'women', 'U.S.', 'are', 'housewives', 'today', 'However', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'many', 'married', 'men', 'jealous', 'more', 'successful', 'wives', 'Thrill', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'well-acted', 'comedy', 'make', 'many', 'people', 'laugh', 'Overall', 'rate', 'film', '4', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Writer', 'Larry', 'Gelbart', 'went', 'write', 'produce', 'long-running', 'TV', 'series', 'M*A*S*H', '1972-1983', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'went', 'direct', 'films', 'such', 'Oh', 'God', '1977', 'Jerk', '1979']",N/A

205479,A1Q87II9MJL7JF,6300184919,Paul Brogan,"[12, 13]","In the early 1960's, a time when Elizabeth Taylor, Kim Novak, Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, and Shirley MacLaine were starring in films, the number one box-office draw was a woman whose success was not built on notoreity but on a natural and skilled ability to play mothers and working women.  She was Doris Day and the 1963 blockbuster, &quot;The Thrill Of It All&quot; is a perfect example why the distinguished Quigley Polling of top box-office attractions for the past 70 years finds Day the number one box-office female star in film history.Skillfully directed by Norman Jewison who later helmed such successes as &quot;Moonstruck&quot; and &quot;In The Heat of the Night&quot; among others, &quot;Thrill&quot; also benefits from a witty script penned by Carl Reiner and a glossy and typically opulent production by Ross Hunter. Jean Louis decks Doris out in some gorgeous outfits that accentuate her luscious figure and the supporting cast is headed by Arlene Francis and Edward Andrews in roles that Hunter originally offered, in 1962, to Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.As Beverly Boyer, wife of a successful doctor and mother of two, Doris is offered a chance to work as a spokeswoman for Happy Soap and leaps at the chance to do more than make homemade bottled ketchup and attend PTA Meetings. While it may sound pat and simple, the scenes are often hysterically funny and Zasu Pitts makes the most of what is little more than a cameo and turned out to be her final cinema appearance.Doris and James Garner, teaming for the first time, work well together and the only regret about &quot;The Thrill of It All&quot; is that the funs ends too quickly.

Though Rock Hudson and James Garner were in the MAJORITY of films she was in back then, (except for one pic, she was usually MARRIED to Garner and chased by bachelor Hudson,) all the flicks she made were funny, topical and great family entertainemnt skewed for adults no matter who her leading man was. This is a shining example.In this one, Doris plays Beverly Boyer, wife of a successful ob-gyn, played by Garner. They live in a burb in a nice split level with a huge, vintage Chevy Impala convertible for him and a Chrysler station wagon for her. One day, a soap manufacturer's wife, a patient of Garner's, invites them to have dinner with her and her husband and father-in-law out of gratitude for her becoming pregnant under his care in her late middle-age. At this dinner, Do-Do/Beverly charms the father-in-law, a curmudgeon with an eye for his own p.r., and Beverly is suddenly the spokesperson for ""Happy"" Soap, the soap she herself uses to wash her kids, because the pine tar shampoo smelled, according to her little daughter, ""ookie"".What follows are the complications that ensue following Bev's popularity as the soap's spokesperson...everybody takes to her genuineness and wholesomeness. She's never at home when either Garner or the kids need her, dinner goes uncooked, Garner is going nuts from blueballs....the list is endless! The kicker is when the head of ""Happy Soap"" has a swimming pool installed in the Boyers' backyard, and Garner, coming home one day, drives that huge Chevy ragtop right into it.Game show perennial Arlene Francis stars as Mrs. Fraleigh, the woman who becomes pregnant under Garner's care and Edward Andrews, who had an entire career based on starring in movies just like this, usually for Disney while Walt was still alive, plays her husband, Gardner Fraleigh, the younger head of ""Happy Soap"". Reginald Owen plays Mr. ""Have A Nut"", Andrews' character's dad, ""Old Tom"" Fraleigh. Eliot Reid, another Disney perennial, plays the smarmy p.r. man for the company who shows signs of rivaling Garner for Bev's affections while she's making the commercials. Oddly enough, Reid and Andrews were in another movie together....They were both in the original ""Absent Minded Professor""...where Reid played almost exactly the same sort of role.If you like good, clean fun and don't want to get TOO safe with your family entertainemnt, you can do no wrong in just picking randomly among the movies made by the great Doris Day, (who, at 83 STILL looks good,) between ""Pillow"" and ""Flowers"". (Though ""Flowers"" is the weakest of the lot...they broke formula with that one...in ""Flowers"", she was MARRIED to Hudson instead of chased by him....)However, this one is one that I heartily recommend!",4,Still as cute as it ever was....,1183248000,"07 1, 2007",2007,2807,"['Pillow', 'Talk', 'Send', 'Me', 'No', 'Flowers', 'Doris', 'Mary', 'Kappelhoff', 'could', 'do', 'wrong', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'James', 'Garner', 'were', 'MAJORITY', 'films', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'one', 'pic', 'was', 'usually', 'MARRIED', 'Garner', 'chased', 'bachelor', 'Hudson', 'flicks', 'made', 'were', 'funny', 'topical', 'great', 'family', 'entertainemnt', 'skewed', 'adults', 'matter', 'who', 'leading', 'man', 'was', 'shining', 'example.In', 'one', 'Doris', 'Beverly', 'Boyer', 'wife', 'successful', 'ob-gyn', 'played', 'Garner', 'live', 'burb', 'nice', 'split', 'level', 'huge', 'vintage', 'Chevy', 'Impala', 'convertible', 'Chrysler', 'station', 'wagon', 'One', 'day', 'soap', 'manufacturer', 'wife', 'patient', 'Garner', 'have', 'dinner', 'husband', 'father-in-law', 'gratitude', 'becoming', 'pregnant', 'care', 'late', 'middle-age', 'dinner', 'Do-Do/Beverly', 'charms', 'father-in-law', 'curmudgeon', 'eye', 'own', 'p.r.', 'Beverly', 'suddenly', 'spokesperson', 'Happy', 'Soap', 'soap', 'wash', 'kids', 'pine', 'tar', 'shampoo', 'smelled', 'according', 'little', 'daughter', 'ookie', 'are', 'complications', 'ensue', 'following', 'Bev', 'popularity', 'soap', 'spokesperson', 'everybody', 'genuineness', 'wholesomeness', 'never', 'home', 'when', 'Garner', 'kids', 'need', 'dinner', 'uncooked', 'Garner', 'going', 'nuts', 'blueballs', '.the', 'list', 'endless', 'kicker', 'when', 'head', 'Happy', 'Soap', 'swimming', 'pool', 'installed', 'Boyers', 'backyard', 'Garner', 'coming', 'home', 'one', 'day', 'huge', 'Chevy', 'ragtop', 'right', 'it.Game', 'show', 'perennial', 'Arlene', 'Francis', 'Mrs.', 'Fraleigh', 'woman', 'who', 'pregnant', 'Garner', 'care', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'who', 'had', 'entire', 'career', 'based', 'starring', 'movies', 'just', 'usually', 'Disney', 'Walt', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'husband', 'Gardner', 'Fraleigh', 'younger', 'head', 'Happy', 'Soap', 'Reginald', 'Owen', 'Mr.', 'Have', 'Nut', 'Andrews', 'character', 'dad', 'Old', 'Tom', 'Fraleigh', 'Eliot', 'Reid', 'Disney', 'perennial', 'smarmy', 'p.r', 'man', 'company', 'who', 'signs', 'rivaling', 'Garner', 'Bev', 'affections', 'making', 'commercials', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'Reid', 'Andrews', 'were', 'movie', 'together', '.They', 'were', 'original', 'Absent', 'Minded', 'Professor', 'where', 'Reid', 'played', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'sort', 'role.If', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'TOO', 'safe', 'family', 'entertainemnt', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'just', 'picking', 'randomly', 'movies', 'made', 'great', 'Doris', 'Day', 'who', '83', 'STILL', 'good', 'Pillow', 'Flowers', 'Flowers', 'weakest', 'lot', 'broke', 'formula', 'one', 'Flowers', 'was', 'MARRIED', 'Hudson', 'instead', 'chased', 'However', 'one', 'one', 'heartily', 'recommend']",N/A

205497,A1V1VFDZ1TZEVU,6300184919,Thomas Freeman,"[11, 16]","Hi all,Just got done re-watching ""The Thrill of It All"" and here are my reactions:First I think the film is light-hearted fun, and a great look back to the golden days of people living ""The American Dream"".  As usual, Doris was superb as Beverly Boyer, a suburban housewife content to be home caring for her husband and two children and doing amazingly domestic activities such as bottling her own ketchup!!  Wow!While Doris looks as I remember her, I was quite taken aback by the youthfulness of James Gardner, whom we have seen on-going on television and movies so have had the opportunity to see him ""age"" gracefully in front of our eyes.  I couldn't surpress a chuckle when the good doctor, frustrated with growing friction with his wife, lights up a cigarette in his hospital office.  That's something we pretty much won't see in a hospital these days!  :)As much as I liked Gardner as Dr. Gerald Boyer, I wasn't too sympathetic with his disdain for his wife's decision to also take on a career.  It was 1963, however, and the career woman was still more exception than the rule, so I tried to see it from that lens.  The film seemed to be on the cusp of the stirrings of women entering the work force in larger numbers because when Dr. Boyer was objecting to his wife working and having a career, he was more than once referred to as a ""victorian"" man, in a most unflattering way.  Perhaps writer Ross Hunter (producer), Carl Reiner (writer), and Norman Jewison (director) were trying to push the envelope a bit here by suggesting that women having careers was not contrary to American values of a stable homelife and happy families.Having said all of this, part of me yearned for the days when the world seemed a happier place and everyone lived with a ""can do"" attitude.  I know it is myth mostly, but the early 60s were a time before the great social divides brought on by the assasination of President Kennedy and protests against the Vietnam war.  America, it seems, still was living in a ""Norman Rockwell"" picture perfect era where most had a beautiful home, the proverbial 2.5 children, and a dog and/or cat.  The romance of this rosy colored view of life is certainly an attractive escape from our modern world problems of terrorism, rampant drug abuse, poverty, and violence.  Watching ""Thrill of It All"" was like a mini-vacation, taking us back to a time when perhaps we all felt safer, more secure, and optimistic about the endless possibilities that laid ahead for us.  Since I was only 3-4 years old at the time, I know I was certainly optimistic! :)About casting:  I think Doris and James showed great chemistry throughout the film.  I think casting Arlene Francis as Mrs. Fraleigh was a bit of a stretch however, as much as I admired her presence in the film, because she was already 58 years old in real life, so the likelihood of her becoming pregnant would be almost nil.  But she rose to the occasion and played the role of a pregnant rich woman to the hilt.  It was a great hook for bringing Beverly and Gerald into the lives of The Fraleigh's and their elderly father, the founder of Happy soap, thus providing the backdrop for further escapades!  All quibbling aside, I think Arlene was fun in the role. A small note: Arlene died 3 years ago this month in San Francisco of complications from Alzheimers and cancer.I really enjoyed watching the cars in this film.  The cars added an additional element of nostalgia as I looked back at America's earlier vehicles.  I was thinking the film had been made in early 1960, but as the limo driving the Fraleighs to the hospital gets stuck in a traffic jam, and Mr. Fraleigh keeps asking this aggressive man for a shoe lace or an unused newspaper, my eyes did a double take!  The guy in the car next to them was driving a 1963 or 1964 Mercury Monterey with the ""breezeway"" window in the back.  That was my Grandfather's last car, he died in 1965 or 4, can't remember now, and my Gram kept using the car into the early 70s.  Because I was particularly close to my Gram, seeing the car again touched my heart and made me smile.I'm sure most of my women friends would disagree with the film's premise that babies are what give women purpose in life, but one can certainly enjoy the romantic fun at the end of the film as the Boyers decide to make good on Mr. Boyer's promise to bring a baby home if ""mommy helped with it"".  I couldn't help laughing at the twin beds in the Boyer's bedroom however, which begged the question ""how easy was it to make babies in a space so little?"" :-)All in all a fun escapist comedy, highly recommended if for nothing else than Doris' classic facial responses to goings-on around her.  It's time to get your own copy of the film and see what a ""The Thrill of It All"" it really is.Tom",5,"Dated, mythical view of American Life, but Fun & enjoyable!",1085270400,"05 23,
