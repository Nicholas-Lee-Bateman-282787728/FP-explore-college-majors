No episode is more graphic than the next, and none of it escalates beyond what you would find in an action movie. However, to contrast this, it is probably the most beautiful television series I have ever seen. Each scene is like a painting whether it be of the cardinals throwing punches at each other or a marriage, every one is gorgeous from the light, the color, the architecture.

If forced to chose only one, it would be the Showtime version hands down for its much more entertaining storyline, more appealing cast & acting, and superior directing & cinematography.  But this series is, in general at least, more historically accurate (less historically inaccurate is probably a better way to put it) and more believable.  I could bore you with the many details to back this statement up, but do not wish to give away parts or create a long review.  I have to very much DISAGREE with anyone claiming this version is ""more riveting"" or the likes, forget that!  It is also false that this version has more nudity and violence, they are about the same in this category.  But one is welcome to their opinion, I just hope others do not takes such a claim on face value and at least looks at previews.

It's written by the creative team behind The Wire"" (Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana), and is a pan-European effort. It's available now on Netflix streaming.This means that the costumes are stunning, the sets accurate, but the dialects a bit jarring, It's in english, but some actors have a German accent (Lucrezia), most are British, some are Italian (Giulia Farnese) and so on. The most jarring accent is from the American, John Dorman, who plays Pope Alexander VI. I took me several episodes to get over the fact that the nasty Police Colonel in ""The Wire"" was Rodrigo Borgia. But once you get over the accent thing, you realize that Rodrigo was a very virile, late-in-life man, and Dorman is actually a very good choice. Like ""The Wire"" the evil or criminal acts and personalities are presented ""as-is"" - there is no moralizing here - these are men of their own times.I'd like to say this version is also more accurate, but what we know is from sources hostile to the Borgias, and accuracy is a nebulous goal. However, the degeneration of Rome at the time is well depicted, and the dresses are gorgeous! The actor who plays the king of France looks as though he stepped from a late medieval painting.For lovers of period pieces such as myself, this is well worth the time.

1515478,A3MTULATO06OS5,B006HFXFAY,"Lady Fancifull ""Tinkerbell""","[2, 9]","The reason I hesitated before giving this French and German funded, English speaking TV mini-series the lowest possible star rating, is purely because of the quality of cinematography and art direction - particularly the beautiful, sumptuous costumes (when they are worn at all)And that is part of the problem. Yes we all know that the Borgias were not the most virtuous or chaste family, and seemed to rival some of the more deranged Ancient Roman Emperors in their cruelty and all-purpose fornication, but still. The bosom count particularly is very high, and I began to think that the target audience must be men in raincoats.Clearly lavishly funded, sadly funds don't appear to have gone the way of a script or, in the main of actors who can build character and relationship, or are allowed to do so by the director. Such a florid and overblown family saga needed performances which, however operatic, are truthfully writ large. This is limp. The Borgia are presented as a Mafiosi type family (Art Malik's character uncannily like Robert Duval's in The Godfather) but whereas Ford Coppola's film, also brutal and sexually explicit at times, was rooted in relationship and a sense of reality, this is wooden.Moreover, the list of companies of different nationalities who were involved, is also presumably responsible for the pan-European, British and American casting, accounting for the great range of accents in which the English dialogue is spoken. Many of the cast do not have English as a first language, which probably accounts for a large part of the wooden and unconvincing performances. Being fluent in a language not your own is no guarantee that you will be able to act convincingly in it. And some dialogue might have been best subtitled, since it is not particularly comprehensibleAnd, I'm afraid I must confess I could get no further than the first 3 episodes. My aim was at least to make it to the second of the 4 directors (episode 5) to see if it had improved, but by the end of episode 3 I had already watched 140 minutes longer than I would have given this if I had seen it live.By episode 3 (during which I fell asleep in the strikingly undramatic choosing the new pope machinations, where actors were failing to bring the dramatic tension to life) the unclothed episodes had markedly dropped - compensated for no doubt by the length of one scene where the actor playing Julia, Rodrigo Borgia's mistress, is standing, completely naked, shot fore and aft whilst she has a discussion with Borgia about his likelihood of being elected pope and then marrying her. I can only think that the constant breast revelations of episode 1 were there to try and keep people watching and distract them from the lack of real, character and relationship driven, dramatic tension.",1,"Breasts, brutality, bouncing buttocks and boredom, boredom, boredom",1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,2786,"['reason', 'hesitated', 'giving', 'French', 'German', 'funded', 'English', 'speaking', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'lowest', 'possible', 'star', 'rating', 'purely', 'quality', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'sumptuous', 'costumes', 'when', 'are', 'worn', 'part', 'problem', 'Yes', 'know', 'Borgias', 'were', 'not', 'most', 'virtuous', 'chaste', 'family', 'seemed', 'rival', 'more', 'deranged', 'Ancient', 'Roman', 'Emperors', 'cruelty', 'all-purpose', 'fornication', 'still', 'bosom', 'count', 'particularly', 'very', 'high', 'began', 'think', 'target', 'audience', 'must', 'be', 'men', 'raincoats.Clearly', 'lavishly', 'funded', 'sadly', 'funds', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'script', 'main', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'build', 'character', 'relationship', 'are', 'allowed', 'do', 'so', 'director', 'florid', 'overblown', 'family', 'saga', 'needed', 'performances', 'however', 'operatic', 'are', 'truthfully', 'writ', 'large', 'limp', 'Borgia', 'are', 'presented', 'Mafiosi', 'type', 'family', 'Art', 'Malik', 'character', 'uncannily', 'Robert', 'Duval', 'Godfather', 'whereas', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'film', 'also', 'brutal', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'times', 'was', 'rooted', 'relationship', 'sense', 'reality', 'wooden.Moreover', 'list', 'companies', 'different', 'nationalities', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'also', 'presumably', 'responsible', 'pan-European', 'British', 'American', 'casting', 'accounting', 'great', 'range', 'accents', 'English', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'Many', 'cast', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'English', 'first', 'language', 'probably', 'large', 'part', 'wooden', 'unconvincing', 'performances', 'Being', 'fluent', 'language', 'not', 'own', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'act', 'convincingly', 'dialogue', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'subtitled', 'not', 'particularly', 'comprehensibleAnd', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'must', 'confess', 'could', 'get', 'further', 'first', '3', 'episodes', 'aim', 'was', 'least', 'make', 'second', '4', 'directors', 'episode', '5', 'see', 'had', 'improved', 'end', 'episode', '3', 'had', 'already', 'watched', '140', 'minutes', 'longer', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'had', 'seen', 'live.By', 'episode', '3', 'fell', 'asleep', 'strikingly', 'undramatic', 'choosing', 'new', 'pope', 'machinations', 'where', 'actors', 'were', 'failing', 'bring', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'life', 'unclothed', 'episodes', 'had', 'markedly', 'dropped', 'compensated', 'doubt', 'length', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'actor', 'playing', 'Julia', 'Rodrigo', 'Borgia', 'mistress', 'standing', 'completely', 'naked', 'shot', 'fore', 'aft', 'whilst', 'discussion', 'Borgia', 'likelihood', 'being', 'elected', 'pope', 'then', 'marrying', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'constant', 'breast', 'revelations', 'episode', '1', 'were', 'there', 'try', 'keep', 'people', 'watching', 'distract', 'lack', 'real', 'character', 'relationship', 'driven', 'dramatic', 'tension']",Borgia Faith And Fear: Season 1

The storyline was much better and to say it was jam-packed with compelling and shocking moments (in contrast with the Showtime series) is an understatement:1.  John Doman as Alexander VI surpasses Jeremy Irons who comes across as too languid and ""English"" and laid back in comparison.  Doman's Pope strikes me as a more authentic version of what Alexander VI might have been like...a complex mix of corruption, passion, political genius, moral blindness, and sometimes even piety.2.  The series spends much more time than the Showtime series on the conclave that put Rodrigo Borgia into the Papacy.  Watching this political intrigue whirling at a dizzying pace is fascinating and compelling to watch.3.  The production values are great and are not outshone by the Showtime series. Battle scenes look real and the faux-Vatican created for the series looks real.4.  I have the impression that ""Borgia:  Faith and Fear"" takes fewer liberties with the historical record than the Showtime series (although I did not a few such things).I would recommend against letting young children watch the show.  It is at times extremely violent (brutal torture, public executions) and it has explicit sex scenes (more so than the Showtime series) but with that said, it was not ""gratuitous"" (the story is set in a bloodsoaked time in a place swirling with vendetta, violence, lust, and all the other dark passions that move people).I agree that sometimes the vast cast of characters does get confusing (telling who belongs to what factions.

FUSCO ""yawnmower""","[5, 6]","I suspect that more heads may have rolled at Canal+ Studios after this debacle than in the series itself -- and there were plenty there!The Borgia story is fascinating, and this version pretty much sticks to facts.  The sets are sumptuous.  The music is nice, too (lovely 'a capella' choral music in the main).  But that is where it ends.The cast is a giant hodge-podge of European and American actors and, as every other reviewer has stated, no attempt was made towards any uniformity of accent.  This is not too much of a problem as everything is in English and there is just a general, generic European sound to their jabbering.  The high-flutin', rather stilted renaissance dialogue, though, sounds even more stilted with accents in the wrong place.All this could be forgiven, but there is one huge, unforgivable, glaring exception that spoils what might have been a decent affair:  American John Doman in the leading, pivotal role of Rodgrigo Borgia.  He may have been acceptable in his role as a NY cop (The Wire), but he is out of his depth here in every conceivable way.  His acting is monochromatic and deplorable.  His desey-dosey Bronx accent is shockingly out of place and distracting, and destroys whatever atmosphere the sets create.  Unlike other reviewers, I could never get past this giant flaw because he continually tops himself in lingual absurdity.The cast is certainly attractive, but one can never believe beautiful Cesare's supposed 'conflict' between the physical and the spiritual in his life, or just about any of his decisions.  Lucrezia is completely implausible as well. Like other cast members, she looks the part (if available descriptions and paintings are accurate), but is just too 'innocent' for words -- certainly there is nothing in the histories to indicate this, and is, therefore, simply a 'dramatic conceit' on the part of the producers and writers.  Juan Borgia is, quite simply, a boor, a complete sociopath, and a monstrous sadist.The producers' misguided choice of Doman as Rodrigo may have been made to match Showtime's ""original crime family"" theme.  In one sense, at least, they may have succeeded:  he sounds like an American gangster of the 50's.  It's just that nobody else does!  This is, however, as unscrupulous, immoral, power-hungry, and thoroughly hypocritical family as was ever presented on screen.  Think John Gatti worshipping at St. Patrick's and hob-nobbing with Cardinal Spellman, after chopping off a few fingers and fitting several of his victims for cement galoshes.A colossal waste of time and resources.

1515488,AER49RJBIWR88,B006HFXFAY,Miim,"[162, 178]","As you must already know, there's two shows about the Borgia family currently running. One from Showtime, and this one here done by Canal +, an European TV channel. Ironically, both were filmed in the same country at the same time, but are completely independent productions.People inevitably compare them both, and many often mistakenly claim the Canal + one is historically more accurate than the Showtime one, something that isn't true.As a history aficionado focusing on the Renaissance era and the Borgias in particular, I can assure you that when it comes to historical accuracy the Canal + show is just as bad as the Showtime one.Furthermore, the characterization isn't always credible in the Canal + version (and occasionally seems to change randomly and suddenly), while the Showtime version lacks in background details and in the people who should be surrounding the Borgias. So they each have their flaws.Both of them have excellent points and are very entertaining as well though, even if every so often they both butcher the historical accuracy to quite amazing levels.The Showtime version has a tendency to do shortcuts and to focus on character development (thus it succeeds in making you interested in the main characters), while the Canal + version tries to show more of the people surrounding them but fails to establish as good of a connection for the watchers, and also frequently veers off into bizarre tangents that are as bad or worse than the ones done by the Showtime version.(A little list of some of the odd things in the Canal + version [SPOILER WARNING]: Cesare involved with witchcraft?? The whole sub-arc with Cesare trying to kill his baby?? The whole arc about Cesare getting raped and then having various post-traumatic reactions every time someone humiliates him by bringing that back up??  [end of spoilers.]All of those are invented for the Canal + show and have no relation whatsoever with history, but the show also passes on rumors contemporary to the Borgias, that are known to be untrue and that the Showtime version did not pass on, thankfully. So claiming one is more historically accurate than the other is a moot point, imho. Both are flawed, and yet still very interesting and enjoyable.)I personally prefer when historical series try to stay closer to actual history, but I realize that more often than not history is sacrificed for the sake of entertaining TV (it was so even with ""Rome""), so I don't really blame either of the two shows for those inevitable peccadilloes.In my opinion, both deserve a solid 4 stars. (I would give 5 for more historical accuracy, but the entertaining value of both is good enough to make it a 4 or even more despite the historical issues.)Especially considering how we've gotten so much garbage fiction about the Borgias over the years; those two shows are surprisingly good compared so many of the past productions about them.In conclusion, both are still extremely entertaining despite the issues with historical accuracy they both have. I strongly recommend watching them both if you're very interested in the period or in the Borgias.",4,"Canal+ ""Borgias"" vs. Showtime's ""The Borgias"".",1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,3120,"['must', 'already', 'know', 'two', 'shows', 'Borgia', 'family', 'currently', 'running', 'One', 'Showtime', 'one', 'here', 'done', 'Canal', '+', 'European', 'TV', 'channel', 'Ironically', 'were', 'filmed', 'same', 'country', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'completely', 'independent', 'productions.People', 'inevitably', 'compare', 'many', 'often', 'mistakenly', 'claim', 'Canal', '+', 'one', 'historically', 'more', 'accurate', 'Showtime', 'one', 'something', ""n't"", 'true.As', 'history', 'aficionado', 'focusing', 'Renaissance', 'era', 'Borgias', 'particular', 'can', 'assure', 'when', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Canal', '+', 'show', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'Showtime', 'one.Furthermore', 'characterization', ""n't"", 'always', 'credible', 'Canal', '+', 'version', 'occasionally', 'change', 'randomly', 'suddenly', 'Showtime', 'version', 'lacks', 'background', 'details', 'people', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'surrounding', 'Borgias', 'have', 'flaws.Both', 'have', 'excellent', 'points', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'well', 'even', 'so', 'often', 'butcher', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'quite', 'amazing', 'levels.The', 'Showtime', 'version', 'tendency', 'do', 'shortcuts', 'focus', 'character', 'development', 'thus', 'making', 'interested', 'main', 'characters', 'Canal', '+', 'version', 'tries', 'show', 'more', 'people', 'surrounding', 'establish', 'good', 'connection', 'watchers', 'also', 'frequently', 'off', 'bizarre', 'tangents', 'are', 'bad', 'worse', 'ones', 'done', 'Showtime', 'version', 'little', 'list', 'odd', 'things', 'Canal', '+', 'version', '[', 'SPOILER', 'WARNING', ']', 'Cesare', 'involved', 'witchcraft', 'whole', 'sub-arc', 'Cesare', 'trying', 'kill', 'baby', 'whole', 'arc', 'Cesare', 'getting', 'raped', 'then', 'having', 'various', 'post-traumatic', 'reactions', 'time', 'someone', 'bringing', 'back', 'up', '[', 'end', 'spoilers', ']', 'are', 'invented', 'Canal', '+', 'show', 'have', 'relation', 'whatsoever', 'history', 'show', 'also', 'rumors', 'contemporary', 'Borgias', 'are', 'known', 'be', 'untrue', 'Showtime', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'pass', 'thankfully', 'So', 'claiming', 'one', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'other', 'moot', 'point', 'imho', 'are', 'flawed', 'yet', 'still', 'very', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'personally', 'prefer', 'when', 'historical', 'series', 'try', 'stay', 'closer', 'actual', 'history', 'realize', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'history', 'sacrificed', 'sake', 'entertaining', 'TV', 'was', 'so', 'even', 'Rome', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'blame', 'two', 'shows', 'inevitable', 'peccadilloes.In', 'opinion', 'deserve', 'solid', '4', 'stars', 'would', 'give', '5', 'more', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'entertaining', 'value', 'good', 'enough', 'make', '4', 'even', 'more', 'historical', 'issues', 'Especially', 'considering', 'how', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'so', 'much', 'garbage', 'fiction', 'Borgias', 'years', 'two', 'shows', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'compared', 'so', 'many', 'past', 'productions', 'them.In', 'conclusion', 'are', 'still', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'issues', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'have', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'watching', ""'re"", 'very', 'interested', 'period', 'Borgias']",Borgia Faith And Fear: Season 1
1515489,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B006HFXFAY,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[7, 7]","SEASON TWO IS AVAILABLE ON GERMAN OR FRENCH RELEASE.  The German release can be found on Amazon UK and I suspect may come to the US before much longer.  Europe had the Blu Ray release in mid 2013.  The third and final season should also be following shortly.Disregard the lead actor and the rest of this production is actually quite outstanding.  This is a very interesting series with a single misstep in casting and a problem with the disc menu layout (on US DVD version only).  First the menu problems on the DVDs: There are five episodes on each of the first two discs.  You will only see three and what looks like a promt back to the main menu.  My discs did not ""play all"" when I selected that option and left me very upset thinking I had defective discs.The ""main menu >"" is actually two prompts.  One for the ""menu"" and the "">"" key is actually a separate icon meant to take you to the next page of episodes. Just move your cursor over until you highlight the arrow key by itself and enter. This will take you to the second page of the list of episodes.  This is likely the same for any DVD set you receive so an exchange will not help you.REVIEW AND COMPARISON: you will recognize the voice of Rodrigo Borgia as an oft used narrator and TV actor John Doman.  He has a great voice for narration, but is the single largest detractor from this otherwise excellent series.  He is good enough to passably get by, but you will likely be distracted by his performance often.  Don't let the main character mislead you into thinking the acting as a whole is bad.  The rest of the cast is terrific, and they don't even speak with english accents (rather than Italian) like the other series that is very popular.  In that sense, this production is actually a little more authentic than the Showtime version.  The actors mostly are actual Italians.  However, those who say this series is better than the Showtime version are a little biased or plain mistaken.  Based strictly on production values and script writing, the Showtime version with Jeremy Irons is clearly superior.  The Showtime version is very high polish, better acted, more star power, and much more epoch.  But this one has it's own charm and a certain feel the other one doesn't.  I really liked the supporting cast in this one.  I strongly suspect this version is more historically accurate though I don't know enough to say definitively.  It just seems to have that attention to authenticity where the other version is more glitz and drama.You will likely enjoy both (if you can get past the lead actor) and the focus of the story is different enough to enjoy both in close succession.  I recommend watching both and leave the expectations behind.  This one might be a rental for most people, but I bought it.",3,CANALI vs SHOWTIME REVIEW -- HOW TO FIND THE HIDDEN EPISODES(Menu problems on dvd version) --- SEASON TWO AVAILABLE IN EUROPE!!!,1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,2774,"['SEASON', 'TWO', 'IS', 'AVAILABLE', 'ON', 'GERMAN', 'OR', 'FRENCH', 'RELEASE', 'German', 'release', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Amazon', 'UK', 'suspect', 'may', 'come', 'US', 'much', 'longer', 'Europe', 'had', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'mid', '2013', 'third', 'final', 'season', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'following', 'shortly.Disregard', 'lead', 'actor', 'rest', 'production', 'actually', 'quite', 'outstanding', 'very', 'interesting', 'series', 'single', 'misstep', 'casting', 'problem', 'disc', 'menu', 'layout', 'US', 'DVD', 'version', 'only', 'First', 'menu', 'problems', 'DVDs', 'are', 'five', 'episodes', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'will', 'only', 'see', 'three', 'what', 'promt', 'back', 'main', 'menu', 'discs', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'when', 'selected', 'option', 'left', 'very', 'upset', 'thinking', 'had', 'defective', 'discs.The', 'main', 'menu', '>', 'actually', 'two', 'prompts', 'One', 'menu', '>', 'key', 'actually', 'separate', 'icon', 'meant', 'take', 'next', 'page', 'episodes', 'Just', 'move', 'cursor', 'highlight', 'arrow', 'key', 'enter', 'will', 'take', 'second', 'page', 'list', 'episodes', 'likely', 'same', 'DVD', 'set', 'receive', 'so', 'exchange', 'will', 'not', 'help', 'you.REVIEW', 'AND', 'COMPARISON', 'will', 'recognize', 'voice', 'Rodrigo', 'Borgia', 'oft', 'used', 'narrator', 'TV', 'actor', 'John', 'Doman', 'great', 'voice', 'narration', 'single', 'largest', 'detractor', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'series', 'good', 'enough', 'passably', 'get', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'distracted', 'performance', 'often', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'main', 'character', 'mislead', 'thinking', 'acting', 'whole', 'bad', 'rest', 'cast', 'terrific', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'english', 'accents', 'rather', 'Italian', 'other', 'series', 'very', 'popular', 'sense', 'production', 'actually', 'little', 'more', 'authentic', 'Showtime', 'version', 'actors', 'mostly', 'are', 'actual', 'Italians', 'However', 'who', 'say', 'series', 'better', 'Showtime', 'version', 'are', 'little', 'biased', 'plain', 'mistaken', 'Based', 'strictly', 'production', 'values', 'script', 'writing', 'Showtime', 'version', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'clearly', 'superior', 'Showtime', 'version', 'very', 'high', 'polish', 'better', 'acted', 'more', 'star', 'power', 'much', 'more', 'epoch', 'one', 'own', 'charm', 'certain', 'feel', 'other', 'one', ""n't"", 'really', 'liked', 'supporting', 'cast', 'one', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'version', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'say', 'definitively', 'just', 'have', 'attention', 'authenticity', 'where', 'other', 'version', 'more', 'glitz', 'drama.You', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'can', 'get', 'lead', 'actor', 'focus', 'story', 'different', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'close', 'succession', 'recommend', 'watching', 'leave', 'expectations', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'rental', 'most', 'people', 'bought']",Borgia Faith And Fear: Season 1

1515493,A1M0OSCFOAMAZO,B006HFXFAY,taaj,"[6, 10]","I think there are two ways to judge a movie. 1) Was it entertaining and a good use of your time. 2) Was the writing, acting, costumes, backdrops and all the things that go into production high quality. The first is a matter of personal taste, of course. For me, I had to force myself to watch the first two episodes because the acting was just SOOOO incredibly bad. It was like the casting director said, ""Who is the worst actor I can get for this role?"" and then said, ""Let's see if I can choose people who do not compliment each other in any way whatsoever."" The acting all the way around is just horrid. All the characters are unconvincing. The wide variety of accents is disturbing and interferes with the flow of the piece. Add to that the bad writing and you have a show that is barely tolerable. This is written without any intrigue. Everything is so obvious- maybe because the actors are so bad that the plot couldn't advance otherwise. It's also written feeling very modern. The piece doesn't feel like a period piece. It feels like people dropped into a set and acting like it is from the Renaissance.The costumes and sets are magnificent. The creators did a good job in many places of recreating what it was like in the 1500s, but it is a fantasy. It is incredibly loosely based on the Borgias and doesn't stick to history at all.I thought it was worth seeing because I like history. It made me think about things, but I'd only recommend it to someone who doesn't have very high standards when it comes to acting and believability. The worst part is that it's based on Papacy history, but completely ignores that culture and religion were completely intertwined. There is almost no religion in this piece.P.S. There is a LOT of sex and nudity- including full frontal nudity of men. If that is not your thing, avoid this. I am not a prude, but I thought it was way overdone. The sex and nudity did nothing to further the story or add to the understanding of the people or the times.",2,Horrible Acting,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,1992,"['think', 'are', 'two', 'ways', 'judge', 'movie', '1', 'Was', 'entertaining', 'good', 'use', 'time', '2', 'Was', 'writing', 'acting', 'costumes', 'backdrops', 'things', 'go', 'production', 'high', 'quality', 'first', 'matter', 'personal', 'taste', 'course', 'had', 'force', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'SOOOO', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'was', 'casting', 'director', 'said', 'Who', 'worst', 'actor', 'can', 'get', 'role', 'then', 'said', 'Let', 'see', 'can', 'choose', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'compliment', 'other', 'way', 'whatsoever', 'acting', 'way', 'just', 'horrid', 'characters', 'are', 'unconvincing', 'wide', 'variety', 'accents', 'disturbing', 'interferes', 'flow', 'piece', 'Add', 'bad', 'writing', 'have', 'show', 'barely', 'tolerable', 'written', 'intrigue', 'Everything', 'so', 'obvious-', 'maybe', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'plot', 'could', ""n't"", 'advance', 'otherwise', 'also', 'written', 'feeling', 'very', 'modern', 'piece', ""n't"", 'feel', 'period', 'piece', 'people', 'dropped', 'set', 'acting', 'Renaissance.The', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'magnificent', 'creators', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'many', 'places', 'recreating', 'what', 'was', '1500s', 'fantasy', 'incredibly', 'loosely', 'based', 'Borgias', ""n't"", 'stick', 'history', 'all.I', 'thought', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'like', 'history', 'made', 'think', 'things', ""'d"", 'only', 'recommend', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'high', 'standards', 'when', 'acting', 'believability', 'worst', 'part', 'based', 'Papacy', 'history', 'completely', 'culture', 'religion', 'were', 'completely', 'intertwined', 'almost', 'religion', 'piece.P.S', 'LOT', 'sex', 'nudity-', 'including', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'men', 'not', 'thing', 'avoid', 'am', 'not', 'prude', 'thought', 'was', 'way', 'overdone', 'sex', 'nudity', 'did', 'nothing', 'further', 'story', 'add', 'understanding', 'people', 'times']",Borgia Faith And Fear: Season 1
