I'm hesitant to give a movie this silly, corny and stupid eight stars but I had to because overall it was fun to watch and provided a number of genuine laughs. In fact, some of the scenes were downright hilarious. A lot of it is innocent old-time slapstick and, if it entertains, it did its job.This was my first look at early Red Skelton films (I had only known him through his TV show) and it reminded of some Bob Hope films except this one had more slapstick and action.It inspired me to go out and buy other Skelton comedies on VHS but, unfortunately, none ever measured up to this one. The real star of film might not have been Skelton, anyway, as Rags Ragland, playing the chauffeur, had perhaps the highest percentage of funny lines. The baseball scene in here also was very good.Yes, this is stupid, generally-speaking, but it's really entertaining. Only a few people have reviewed it (as of my review) so apparently a lot of movie fans haven't seen this. That's too bad, especially with the older crowd, because they've missed a funny movie.",4,Rags and Red Bring A Lot Of Laughs,1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,1106,"['like', 'old-fashioned', 'corny', 'humor', ""'ll"", 'love', ""'m"", 'hesitant', 'give', 'movie', 'silly', 'corny', 'stupid', 'eight', 'stars', 'had', 'overall', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'provided', 'number', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'fact', 'scenes', 'were', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'lot', 'innocent', 'old-time', 'slapstick', 'did', 'job.This', 'was', 'first', 'look', 'early', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'films', 'had', 'only', 'known', 'TV', 'show', 'reminded', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'one', 'had', 'more', 'slapstick', 'action.It', 'inspired', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'other', 'Skelton', 'comedies', 'VHS', 'unfortunately', 'none', 'ever', 'measured', 'up', 'one', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'Skelton', 'anyway', 'Rags', 'Ragland', 'playing', 'chauffeur', 'had', 'perhaps', 'highest', 'percentage', 'funny', 'lines', 'baseball', 'scene', 'here', 'also', 'was', 'very', 'good.Yes', 'stupid', 'generally-speaking', 'really', 'entertaining', 'Only', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'reviewed', 'review', 'so', 'apparently', 'lot', 'movie', 'fans', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'too', 'bad', 'especially', 'older', 'crowd', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'funny', 'movie']",N/A
