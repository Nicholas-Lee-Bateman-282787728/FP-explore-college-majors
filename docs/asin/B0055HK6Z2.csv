1442859,A12EZUL89ERV86,B0055HK6Z2,"C. Boucher ""CLB""","[4, 8]","Way too much over-head. Seems every choice they make is the wrong one. The are constantly growing deeper into debt and borrowing money from anyone who will give it to them, only to make more bad choices. They had no clue how to mine from the get-go. One catastrophe after another. A comedy of errors, but it's not the slightest bit funny.It is painful to watch. I watched season one on Netflix and they spent over $250K only to recover $20K in gold before the winter forced them to leave. Their operating costs were $1K/day. Have of the gold they recovered was just flushed right out the end of their processing plant due to sheer ignorance.They had their wives and kids up there with them and they were drinking water straight from the streams, unfiltered. Bears and God-only-knows what else everywhere, but didn't have the common sense to bring a Brita Filter to protect themselves from things in the water. One of the little girls had a grand mal seizure and was rushed to the hospital. Oops. Goofed again.This is really frustrating to watch, though I can't help myself. I bought season two on Amazon because I figured they had to have learned enough from their bungling in Season one to make it a better view. So far, NOT! It only gets worse. And now there is definitely more scripting, to increase the drama. With this show, they don't need more drama.And the narrator isn't as enjoyable to listen to as Mike Rowe (Deadliest Catch, Dirty Jobs.) They need someone with a more interesting voice. That alone would help the show.Do yourself a favor and just walk away before bothering to get into this show. You'll be glad I saved you from the misery.",3,"""What not to do when hunting for gold.""",1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,1652,"['Way', 'too', 'much', 'over-head', 'Seems', 'choice', 'make', 'wrong', 'one', 'are', 'constantly', 'growing', 'deeper', 'debt', 'borrowing', 'money', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'only', 'make', 'more', 'bad', 'choices', 'had', 'clue', 'how', 'mine', 'get-go', 'One', 'catastrophe', 'comedy', 'errors', 'not', 'slightest', 'bit', 'funny.It', 'painful', 'watch', 'watched', 'season', 'one', 'Netflix', 'spent', '250K', 'only', 'recover', '20K', 'gold', 'winter', 'forced', 'leave', 'operating', 'costs', 'were', '1K/day', 'Have', 'gold', 'recovered', 'was', 'just', 'flushed', 'right', 'end', 'processing', 'plant', 'due', 'sheer', 'ignorance.They', 'had', 'wives', 'kids', 'there', 'were', 'drinking', 'water', 'straight', 'streams', 'unfiltered', 'Bears', 'God-only-knows', 'what', 'else', 'everywhere', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'common', 'sense', 'bring', 'Brita', 'Filter', 'protect', 'things', 'water', 'One', 'little', 'girls', 'had', 'grand', 'mal', 'seizure', 'was', 'rushed', 'hospital', 'Oops', 'Goofed', 'again.This', 'really', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'bought', 'season', 'two', 'Amazon', 'figured', 'had', 'have', 'learned', 'enough', 'bungling', 'Season', 'one', 'make', 'better', 'view', 'So', 'far', 'NOT', 'only', 'worse', 'now', 'definitely', 'more', 'scripting', 'increase', 'drama', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'more', 'drama.And', 'narrator', ""n't"", 'as', 'enjoyable', 'listen', 'Mike', 'Rowe', 'Deadliest', 'Catch', 'Dirty', 'Jobs', 'need', 'someone', 'more', 'interesting', 'voice', 'alone', 'would', 'help', 'show.Do', 'favor', 'just', 'walk', 'away', 'bothering', 'get', 'show', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'saved', 'misery']",Gold Rush Alaska
