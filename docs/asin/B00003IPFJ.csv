545044,AVWWFK3FZDEL2,B00003IPFJ,D. Mckinzie,"[0, 0]","A major earthquake hits New York City!  It makes a great movie, actually.  I first saw this movie on television and a huge portion had been cut out, though I didn't know it at the time.  When I would see photos of the video of it, it showed the head from the Statue of Liberty, lying the harbour.  I used to wonder why they used that picture, since it didn't happen in the movie, but it actually does happen; they just cut that part out.  In fact, they cut out so much that made the movie make better sense, that I am amazed that I even liked it before I saw the uncut version.  There are a bunch of subplots going on in this movie.  Jennifer Garner (I think that's her name) plays a young ballerina in the NYC ballet, whose father is killed and who spends most of the movie trying to find her mother, trailed by a young cab-driver who has only lived in the country a short while and has decided to become her personal body-guard.  There's the mother and son story, the fire-chief and mayor fighting story, the fire-chief's daughter story, the mayor's daughter story, the mayor's mother story, and the dad trying to get back home story.  So it's a pretty action-filled movie, in some ways.  But basically, it's a disaster movie filled with stories of people who are enduring a horrific event and even rise above it, learning that they are stronger than they thought they were and they can survive.  Some people might say the idea of an earthquake in NYC is a little contrived, but earthquakes have been known to occur in odd places and anything's possible.  Don't look for an Oscar-Worthy plot; just good dramatic, ""disaster movie"" entertainment.  I've watched it several times and still enjoy it.",5,Love this movie!,1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,1697,"['major', 'earthquake', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'great', 'movie', 'actually', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'television', 'huge', 'portion', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'time', 'When', 'would', 'see', 'photos', 'video', 'showed', 'head', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'lying', 'harbour', 'used', 'wonder', 'why', 'used', 'picture', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'movie', 'actually', 'happen', 'just', 'cut', 'part', 'out', 'fact', 'cut', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'made', 'movie', 'make', 'better', 'sense', 'am', 'amazed', 'even', 'liked', 'saw', 'uncut', 'version', 'are', 'bunch', 'subplots', 'going', 'movie', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'think', 'name', 'young', 'ballerina', 'NYC', 'ballet', 'father', 'killed', 'who', 'most', 'movie', 'trying', 'find', 'mother', 'trailed', 'young', 'cab-driver', 'who', 'only', 'lived', 'country', 'short', 'while', 'decided', 'become', 'personal', 'body-guard', 'mother', 'son', 'story', 'fire-chief', 'mayor', 'fighting', 'story', 'fire-chief', 'daughter', 'story', 'mayor', 'daughter', 'story', 'mayor', 'mother', 'story', 'dad', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'story', 'pretty', 'action-filled', 'movie', 'ways', 'basically', 'disaster', 'movie', 'filled', 'stories', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'enduring', 'horrific', 'event', 'even', 'rise', 'learning', 'are', 'stronger', 'thought', 'were', 'can', 'survive', 'people', 'might', 'say', 'idea', 'earthquake', 'NYC', 'little', 'contrived', 'earthquakes', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'occur', 'odd', 'places', 'anything', 'possible', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Oscar-Worthy', 'plot', 'just', 'good', 'dramatic', 'disaster', 'movie', 'entertainment', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'still', 'enjoy']",N/A

Van Nus,"[12, 15]","As an avid sci-fi/action genre maven who likes special effects, I was very surprised that a low budget movie did so well in cinematography.  A well written and acted script,and very good special effects lends some credibility to having a powerful earthquake in a relatively low risk zone.  It was eerie seeing the Trade Center again (as so many movies do), suffer damage other than terrorist driven.  The main complaint about the DVD is that it is not widescreen.  Being a TV movie, one would not expect widescreen, but the jewelcase description says ""formatted to fit your TV"", thus it leads one to believe that a widescreen exists.

A t.v. movie originally aired on NVC, AFTERSHOCK is directed well by Mikail Solomon and has a fine cast.  The script is typical vignettes of several people and how they deal with the quake, but it is well written and performed, and adds the requisite human touch to the film.  The overall acting is very good:  Tom Selleck as the disgruntled fire chief who is having an ongoing political battle with Mayor Charles S. Dutton; Jennifer Garner as a ballet wannabe who meets up with a Russian cabby; Sharon Lawrence is very good as a mother whose carelessness rendered her little boy an invalid; Lisa Nicole Carson as an up and coming lawyer who gets an alleged murderer off the hook only to doubt his innocence; Cicely Tyson as the feisty mayor's mother who turns a street kid into a young man; and many actors whose names I can't recall who did a fine job in the storyline.The earthquake sequence is devastating and very convincing.

The actors and actresses all did their roles very well and the earthquake scenes were very action-packed.Tom Skerritt plays the fire chief of New York, who is about to resign from his job in protest due to a never-ending conflict on city policies made by the city mayor.Jennifer Garner plays a struggling ballet dancer who is trying to keep herself in her house, with much help from her banker father, until her apartment building is blown up by a gas leak caused on by several slight tremors rocking through Manhattan. When her father is killed in the major tremor that destroys the city, she goes out to seek her mother, with the much-needed assistance of a cabdriver that had moved to NYC from Russia three months earlier.There are a few other plots in this movie, like an overprotective mother with a troubled past who goes out to save her slightly-limping son that is trapped on the top floor of his collapsed school in the restroom, and the father who is currently away on a business trip, and does everything in his power to get back to NYC to help his family.The mayor's daughter is a public defender who just won a court case in declaring her client innocent from the accusing charge of him murdering his handicapped wife. But when both of them are trapped in the earthquake's aftermath down in the subway with several other survivors, she discovers the dark side of her client as his odd behavior takes over and wonders if he was truly innocent after all.The mayor's elderly mother ends up trapped in the basement of a destroyed church, along with a troubled young man who had been hired to help clean up the church, and they have to find a way out. In the midst of the crisis, the fire chief and the mayor have to settle their problems and work together, with the knowledge that their city emergency plans have been destroyed with the rest of One Police Plaza, along with the police chief as well. The fire chief is also anguished at the news that his teenaged daughter is trapped in the collapsed ruins of her high school and he goes out of his way to help rescue her with any students that are trapped with her.All in all, this makes for a great movie.
