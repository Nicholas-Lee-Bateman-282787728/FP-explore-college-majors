1021314,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B000IMSQI8,Andrew Raker,"[4, 4]","In this film entitled Ship Wrecked (or Haakon Haakonsen) directed by Nils Gaup, a young Norwegian boy named Haakon [see bottom right DVD release cover] (played by Stian Smestad) volunteers to work as a cabin boy after his father receives an injury that prevents him from earning money for his family and paying back a debt owed to a fellow Norwegianer. While on the ship, Haakon becomes suspicious of Lt. John Merrick [man holding the pistol on the DVD cover] (played by Gabriel Byrne). However, before Haakon can inform the captain (played by Kjell Stormoen) of his suspicious, the captain ""dies."" While the captain's death is naturally suspicious, there was nothing Haakon or the crew could do except resign themselves to Lt. John Merrick's dictatorial leadership.Without giving away anything more than the rising action, let this review state that the film is rather predictable - a blend between a Home Alone 3 and Walt Disney's Treasure Island in terms of action. The film appealed to me personally as a child growing up in the 1990s because it did not seem to sugarcoat (like many Disney films of the late 1990s under Michael Eisner's poor leadership) the fact that there are problems, and evil, in the world. Lt. John Merrick represents a fairly accurate example in terms of villainy (as does Danglars in Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo or Compeyson in Dickens' Great Expectations).Haakon, as the protagonist, shows great concern for those he cares about, saving them from the evil ""Merrick"" and risking his life in the process. In fact, he represents such a complete opposite to the murderous Merrick that I cannot personally help but rejoice at the humorous resolution to the film, which I will not reveal.Certainly, there are some scenes in the film that are difficult to believe possible and a gorilla (that is obviously someone dressed up in a gorilla costume). But then again, the film was a low-budget 1990 production.When this film was released years ago on VHS, Amazon.com reviewers stated the following that I believe parallel my opinions of this film:The action is good, the buddy-bonding touching, and it is refreshing these days to see a child in the movies who gets to be a child, rather than a leering 30-year old in a prepubescent body. (Nysocboy)This movie should be reissued for a whole new generation of youngsters. It's a beautiful tale, with just the kind of imagination inspiring adventure that young children love. The heros demonstrate innocence, strong character, hard work, self sacrifice, family ties, honesty, loyalty and resourcefulness. Beautiful scenary to boot. I for one don't miss the profanity, commercialism, immorality and shallowness that seems to be so common in many of the popular films today. (Texas Mom)From first seeing this film in 1991 (I was 9), it became an instant classic for me and my childhood. It became my ""sick day"" movie. Whenever my sister or I took a sick day from school, we would have to watch Shipwrecked. It probably drove my mother nuts. The kids will enjoy it, and adults won't get bored, either. I watched it recently for the first time in years, and I still found it pretty interesting. It's not a blockbuster, it's not supposed to be. But it's a classy family film nonetheless, which might be hard to find in Disney these days. Some pluses: the scenery is excellent (shot in three international locations), the music is superb, and the plot will keep you interested. I strongly recommend it.

He's even managed to get Haakon a commission as cabin boy on his own vessel, the Flora--something he says he would have given everything to have when he was his son's age.  Haakon isn't sure he wants to go, but when an accident at sea leaves his father unable to return to the ship and the farm is threatened with foreclosure, he bravely agrees to pay the debt himself by taking the position.  With the support of his father's good friend, the young sailor Jens (Trond Peter Stamso Munch), he gets through the crew's early hazing, learns his job, and earns the good regard of the captain (Kjell Stormoen).  But the Flora's voyage is slated to take her through the pirate territory that lies between Australia and the East African coast, so she takes aboard a supposed lieutenant (Gabriel Byrne) in the British Royal Navy.  Haakon comes to the conclusion that the new first mate isn't quite what he says he is, though he doesn't have any real proof.  Then he discovers a stowaway aboard--a young Australo-British girl named Mary (Louisa Haigh), recently orphaned, who's trying to get to her uncle in Calcutta--and a storm hurls the Flora onto a reef.  Separated from his shipmates, Haakon washes up on a jungle island where he contrives to support himself, discovers a collection of useful wrack from the Flora, and then finds a hoard of weapons, jewels, and a clipping that identifies the supposed lieutenant as a notorious pirate.  Certain he'll return for it if he survived, Haakon moves the treasure to a new hidning place and sets to work seeding the island with traps.  Unexpectedly he's reunited with Jens and Mary, and then the pirates do return.  Now the trio must somehow elude them and capture their ship if they hope to get off the island alive.In the beginning the movie is a bit slow, but after Haakon is stranded the pace picks up, and you can see clearly how his family's situation back home and the skills he's acquired at sea contribute to his ability to survive.  It's obvious that this is a coming-of-age story and one that many kids will wish, in our more ambiguous society, that they could share.  Haakon is a sympathetic character and his friendship with Jens and Mary is very believable.  There's no graphic violence and the film is definitely family-friendly, though marred by one major impossibility (a gorilla on what is presumably an Indian Ocean island).

1021329,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000IMSQI8,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[3, 3]","Disney's Shipwrecked was released in 1990, the same year that I became intimately acquainted with the TNT production of Treasure Island (1990 TVmovie) starring Charlton Heston. My then-ten-year-old self became endlessly obsessed with all things pirates, sailing, and tall ships for years to come. Shipwrecked was a Norwegian production based on by Norwegian author O. V. Falck-Ytter's ""Haakon Haakonsen. En norsk Robinson,"" a Norwegian children's novel from 1873 that was a tale of a ""Norwegian Family Robinson."" Directed by Nils Gaup and starring almost entirely Norwegian actors, it was filmed on location in Norway, Spain, the UK and Fiji.The plot revolves around the titular Haakon Haakonsen (Stian Smestad), a young boy in 1850s Norway who is forced to go to sea as a cabin boy when his father is injured on a sea voyage. His father's friend Jens (Trond Peter Stams Munch) agrees to look out for him on board the Flora. Haakon goes through some inevitable growing pains as a boy onboard a ship for the first time; some of the seasoned sailors have fun playing pranks on him at first, but Haakon is watched over by Jens and the kindly captain. After a shore leave in Sydney, Haakon discovers a stowaway on board; Mary (Louisa Millwood-Haigh), an orphan trying to reach her uncle in Calcutta). But the voyage meets an abrupt end when a suspicious Royal Navy officer (Gabriel Byrne) takes control of the ship and the crew is shipwrecked in the tropics.The movie moves along quite well until the ending, which is a tad disappointing in tone after the great setup (it borders on unintentionally comic; for a really great pirate chase, check out the end of Fraser Heston's 1990 made-for-TV Treasure Island for TNT; now there's a scurvy lot to give you nightmares!) Beautifully shot and with a memorable score by Patrick Doyle, Shipwrecked is a family-friendly tale of loyalty, discovery, and adventure on the high seas. It's short on special effects and low on violence or profanity; instead, it's built on solid characters and a well-crafted plot.All of the Norwegian actors are strong, particularly the two leads, and Louisa turns in a spirited performance as a feisty orphan. Gabriel Byrne puts in a deliciously wicked turn as the villain; you can just sense the danger that lurks under the surface when he snarls out threats (if you enjoyed Byrne in Shipwrecked, check out his captivating performance of a loving father struggling with grief and alcoholism in Disney's magicalInto the West). The Norwegian actors have slight accents, but nothing that should interfere with understanding the dialogue.Shipwrecked made quite an impression on me, and I'm grateful that it's finally available on DVD as of fall 2008 (it was previously only available as a Club Disney selection). Those who enjoyedSwiss Family Robinson (Vault Disney Collection), Robinson Crusoe, and Treasure Island should find much to like in Shipwrecked. Sadly, the DVD doesn't come with *any* extras save subtitles, but it's a worthy addition to any family's DVD collection.",4,A fabulous swashbuckler from Norway,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,3042,"['Disney', 'Shipwrecked', 'was', 'released', '1990', 'same', 'year', 'became', 'intimately', 'acquainted', 'TNT', 'production', 'Treasure', 'Island', '1990', 'TVmovie', 'starring', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'then-ten-year-old', 'self', 'became', 'endlessly', 'obsessed', 'things', 'pirates', 'sailing', 'tall', 'ships', 'years', 'come', 'Shipwrecked', 'was', 'Norwegian', 'production', 'based', 'Norwegian', 'author', 'O.', 'V.', 'Falck-Ytter', 'Haakon', 'Haakonsen', 'En', 'norsk', 'Robinson', 'Norwegian', 'children', 'novel', '1873', 'was', 'tale', 'Norwegian', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'Directed', 'Nils', 'Gaup', 'starring', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Norwegian', 'actors', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Norway', 'Spain', 'UK', 'Fiji.The', 'plot', 'titular', 'Haakon', 'Haakonsen', 'Stian', 'Smestad', 'young', 'boy', '1850s', 'Norway', 'who', 'forced', 'go', 'sea', 'cabin', 'boy', 'when', 'father', 'injured', 'sea', 'voyage', 'father', 'friend', 'Jens', 'Trond', 'Peter', 'Stams', 'Munch', 'look', 'out', 'board', 'Flora', 'Haakon', 'inevitable', 'growing', 'pains', 'boy', 'ship', 'first', 'time', 'seasoned', 'sailors', 'have', 'fun', 'playing', 'pranks', 'first', 'Haakon', 'watched', 'Jens', 'kindly', 'captain', 'shore', 'leave', 'Sydney', 'Haakon', 'stowaway', 'board', 'Mary', 'Louisa', 'Millwood-Haigh', 'orphan', 'trying', 'reach', 'uncle', 'Calcutta', 'voyage', 'abrupt', 'end', 'when', 'suspicious', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'officer', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'control', 'ship', 'crew', 'shipwrecked', 'tropics.The', 'movie', 'moves', 'quite', 'well', 'ending', 'tad', 'disappointing', 'tone', 'great', 'setup', 'unintentionally', 'comic', 'really', 'great', 'pirate', 'chase', 'check', 'end', 'Fraser', 'Heston', '1990', 'made-for-TV', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'TNT', 'now', 'scurvy', 'lot', 'give', 'nightmares', 'Beautifully', 'shot', 'memorable', 'score', 'Patrick', 'Doyle', 'Shipwrecked', 'family-friendly', 'tale', 'loyalty', 'discovery', 'adventure', 'high', 'seas', 'short', 'special', 'effects', 'low', 'violence', 'profanity', 'instead', 'built', 'solid', 'characters', 'well-crafted', 'plot.All', 'Norwegian', 'actors', 'are', 'strong', 'particularly', 'two', 'leads', 'Louisa', 'spirited', 'performance', 'feisty', 'orphan', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'deliciously', 'wicked', 'turn', 'villain', 'can', 'just', 'sense', 'danger', 'surface', 'when', 'snarls', 'out', 'threats', 'enjoyed', 'Byrne', 'Shipwrecked', 'check', 'out', 'captivating', 'performance', 'loving', 'father', 'struggling', 'grief', 'alcoholism', 'Disney', 'magicalInto', 'West', 'Norwegian', 'actors', 'have', 'slight', 'accents', 'nothing', 'should', 'interfere', 'understanding', 'dialogue.Shipwrecked', 'made', 'quite', 'impression', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'fall', '2008', 'was', 'previously', 'only', 'available', 'Club', 'Disney', 'selection', 'who', 'enjoyedSwiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'Vault', 'Disney', 'Collection', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'should', 'find', 'much', 'like', 'Shipwrecked', 'Sadly', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'come', '*any*', 'extras', 'save', 'subtitles', 'worthy', 'addition', 'family', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

The usual Disney film characters are very well-fed, white, stain free, and very middle class. To see the main character being 'sold' off to pay a family debt may seem foreign to us now, but I imagine that it was commonplace in many cultures in the past. The parting of the son to begin his duty as cabin boy on a ship was a bit hard to take. The trials he endured were fanciful, his resolution was gratifying, and the end was most satisfying.My family enjoyed this film, to see a boy thrust into harsh conditions, find a bit of love, survive an accident, and fight for treasure and his love. It did make my daughter swoon at seeing the hero being strong, shirtless, and creative in his battle with evil.Gabriel Byrne's role as the evil pirate was so cool. Deep down inside I felt that he enjoyed playing the role in this children's story. This is not the first children's film that he's done and I salute him for it. Perhaps the point of the film IS that right always triumphs in the end. It is unfortunate that this DVD is very scarce. It seems that it has been only available through a Disney film club, but no more.",4,Times were cruel back then.,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,1241,"['Being', 'Disney', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'see', 'main', 'character', 'family', 'suffering', 'privation', 'class', 'bigotry', 'usual', 'Disney', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well-fed', 'white', 'stain', 'free', 'very', 'middle', 'class', 'see', 'main', 'character', 'being', ""'sold"", 'pay', 'family', 'debt', 'may', 'seem', 'foreign', 'now', 'imagine', 'was', 'commonplace', 'many', 'cultures', 'past', 'parting', 'son', 'begin', 'duty', 'cabin', 'boy', 'ship', 'was', 'bit', 'hard', 'take', 'trials', 'endured', 'were', 'fanciful', 'resolution', 'was', 'gratifying', 'end', 'was', 'most', 'satisfying.My', 'family', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'see', 'boy', 'thrust', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'find', 'bit', 'love', 'survive', 'accident', 'fight', 'treasure', 'love', 'did', 'make', 'daughter', 'swoon', 'seeing', 'hero', 'being', 'strong', 'shirtless', 'creative', 'battle', 'evil.Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'role', 'evil', 'pirate', 'was', 'so', 'cool', 'Deep', 'inside', 'felt', 'enjoyed', 'playing', 'role', 'children', 'story', 'not', 'first', 'children', 'film', 'done', 'salute', 'Perhaps', 'point', 'film', 'right', 'always', 'triumphs', 'end', 'unfortunate', 'DVD', 'very', 'scarce', 'been', 'only', 'available', 'Disney', 'film', 'club', 'more']",N/A
