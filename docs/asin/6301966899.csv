278077,AW3VZ5O895LRK,6301966899,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[6, 8]","Writer-director Kathryn Bigelow was a very talented painter before she went to film school to become a movie director.  It shows in her work which is very artistic for someone primarily known to the action-adventure genre of filmmaking.  She is a breath of fresh air in this genre, investing it with literate scripts and haunting imagery.  Her most frequent producer is James Cameron (the action wonder king, &quot;Titanic,&quot; &quot;Terminator&quot;), who is also her ex-husband.  You can see his influence on her work as well. Bigelow's &quot;Blue Steel&quot; is set in the police world with a new cop played by Jamie Lee Curtis.  She heroically saves a whole supermarket full of people from an armed gunman only to set off a serial killer played by the aptly villainous Ron Silver, a commodities trader in New York City.  The film is a war of wits between Silver and Curtis, with Silver exhibiting all the raw cunning of a supremely intelligent man who has been lured over to the dark side of his existence.  Although not as artistic as most of her work, &quot;Blue Steel&quot; works very well in the police movie genre.",4,Compelling but not Bigelow's best film,1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,1125,"['Writer-director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'painter', 'went', 'film', 'school', 'become', 'movie', 'director', 'work', 'very', 'artistic', 'someone', 'primarily', 'known', 'action-adventure', 'genre', 'filmmaking', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'genre', 'investing', 'literate', 'scripts', 'haunting', 'imagery', 'most', 'frequent', 'producer', 'James', 'Cameron', 'action', 'wonder', 'king', 'quot', 'Titanic', 'quot', 'quot', 'Terminator', 'quot', 'who', 'also', 'ex-husband', 'can', 'see', 'influence', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Bigelow', 'quot', 'Blue', 'Steel', 'quot', 'set', 'police', 'world', 'new', 'cop', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'heroically', 'whole', 'supermarket', 'full', 'people', 'armed', 'gunman', 'only', 'set', 'off', 'serial', 'killer', 'played', 'aptly', 'villainous', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'commodities', 'trader', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'film', 'war', 'wits', 'Silver', 'Curtis', 'Silver', 'exhibiting', 'raw', 'cunning', 'supremely', 'intelligent', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'lured', 'dark', 'side', 'existence', 'not', 'as', 'artistic', 'most', 'work', 'quot', 'Blue', 'Steel', 'quot', 'very', 'well', 'police', 'movie', 'genre']",Blue Steel VHS

However if you are not a fan of this type of b movie made on a A budget then you won't enjoy it as much as I did.

Blue Steel is one of those movies. Jamie Lee Curtis plays a rookie cop who is being held responsible for civilian casualties (or should I say murders) which she did not commit. Sounds like an interesting plot, right? It would be had the script not been so poorly written. The supporting actors give such a bland/typical performance that not even Jamie Lee could have saved the dialogue. Aside from the acting, the film does not give the action packed performance that it promises. Some scenes are quite dull and as you are watching you wonder half way through the movie when the cop (Jamie Lee) is going to finally kill the psychopath whose been after her.

278092,A20NJAPECFGIR9,6301966899,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[2, 5]","There are some things to love about Blue Steel but there are some things that make the movie go sour before it even begins. Jamie Lee Curtis plays a rookie cop whose life is turned upside down by an obsessive man who happens to be the city's recent serial killer. After seeing Megan Turner ( Curtis ) kill a robber ( Tom Sizemore ) in a grocery store, Eugene Hunt ( Ron Silver ) goes on a mission to not only acclaim legendary status with his own murders, but win the heart of Megan and he goes about this in some very twisted ways. He soon ends up making it look like Curtis is the killer in hopes that it brings her closer to him. Blue Steel is very suspenseful and you must give it points for keeping the tension high, but it lacked a lot in the plot and characterization departments.First off, we needed at least a little background on Ron Silver's character. Granted I understand the director probably kept this a secret on purpose, but she should have shared just a tiny hint of how this stockbroker can count change during the day but kill innocent bystanders at will during the night.Secondly, the romance factor was totally off. Instead of having Silver obsessed with Curtis, the script should have concentrated more on her capturing him once she found out he was a serial killer. Curtis' character danced around the real police work for the first hour then finally decided to do real police work when the film was almost over. As for the obsession, sorry but I couldn't go for that. Jamie Lee is attractive in her own way but I don't believe she's the kind of woman someone would get so obsessed with. And when Silver blurts out that line: "" You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life "", I couldn't keep a straight face. In some parts the dialogue wasn't realistic at all and was terribly out of place. The longest scenes are the ones that should have been cut short. We should have seen more one on one interaction between Silver and Curtis since these were the primary characters. Instead Curtis spends most of her time with the police, trying to claim her innocence.  There are so many silly scenes in the film you can spot them a mile away. Blue Steel is very graphic and at times uncomfortable, especially when Silver brutally rapes Curtis while trying to choke her with a gun in his hand. This didn't seem necessary but thrown in for shock. The best part of the film was the end duel between Curtis and Silver. This was one of the most entertaining shooting scenes ever filmed for an actress and it was well worth it. Jamie held her own with the last scenes alone.Ron Silver was fantastic and should have gotten an Oscar for his portrayal of Eugene. Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't quite fit the cop role and you get sick of people saying how beautiful she is throughout the entire movie.  Blue Steel is a one time deal. You'll either love it or hate it.

278093,A363QRXP83K8ZE,6301966899,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[2, 4]","I wanted to like Blue Steel more than I did, but in the end the film is not effective as a psychological cop drama, an action film, or a thriller.  It's only use seems to be as an over stylized, heavy-handed exercise in emasculating a female cop for some role reversal in a genre dominated by tough male cops (Dirty Harry and its dozens of imitators).  It's sure to excite film theorists looking for a feminist angle, but in the end it comes off as plain silly when it had a lot of potential.Jamie Lee plays Megan, a rookie cop who gets suspended after shooting a robber her first night on the job.  (The robber is a cracked out Tom Sizemore).  The crime scene gun, which would clear her, disappears into the hands of one of the witnesses.  Ron Silver is the Wall Street gold trader who grabs the gun and begins a maniacal killing spree, carving Curtis' name into the bullets and implicating her.  In the meantime, he begins seeing her romantically after arranging a chance meeting on the street.  This enables him to really play with her mind; as the relationship escalates, the bodies start piling up.Even after he implicates himself to her during a demented revelation of sorts (that gun grabbing business will have film theorists drooling), his status makes him a very unlikely suspect, and his expensive lawyer is able to shield him from the cops.  He even shoots Megan's best friend right in front of her, yet he still gets away with it.  The man is clearly nuts, yet he's somehow untouchable.There is practically no insight into Silver's character.  Like how a successful trader (who readily describes his own job trading gold options as 'misanthropic') is just one stray gun away from becoming the next Son of Sam.  Silver is a tremendous actor but he's given little to work with.  Having Silver play a trader must be some comment on a male dominated industry (Wall Street, traditionally) and its relationship to other primal male instincts (killing?), only hinted at in some of Silver's wackier moments.  It's not exactly subtle, and if you think about it, it's even slightly offensive.The movie is rife with plot holes and jumps in logic that you dismiss until the end, when absurdity really takes over as a deserted Wall Street turns into the Wild West.  Our two principles chase each other, exchange gunfire at close range, get shot, run some more, shoot each other again, etc.  I kept thinking it was a dream sequence, but it wasn't.  Silver turns into Michael Meyers; he just can't seem to die.  He's shot, he's down, he's back up, he's shot again, etc.  Don't worry, that wasn't a plot spoiler; you can see it coming from the opening titles.Blue Steel could have been much better.  Perhaps it was too early in director Kathryn Bigelow's career.  The intense, confident visual style of Near Dark is here, but the film is mainly concerned with vindicating its androgynous star's character through (typically male) movie violence.  The significance is that it's a female director.  The film would probably make even less of splash were it released today.There are worse ways to kill time.  The DVD is not bad, it looks and sounds good enough.  So nice of the studio to include nothing in the way of extras; everyone loves having to buy the same product yet again.

She makes moody crime films that are always stylish, gritty, and that boast well choreographed action scenes. In 'Blue Steel' she tells the story of Margaret Turner (Jamie Lee Curtis) a rookie cadet just graduated from the Academy. After less than twenty four hours on the job she has prevented a grocery store stick up by blowing away the robber (Tom Sizemore). Turner's partner was in the bathroom so the rookie went it alone. This doesn't sit well with her superior officer Nick Mann (an excellent Clancy Brown). He takes her badge away and relieves her of duty. The police never found the suspect's weapon because it has been stolen by a commodities trader named Eugene (Ron Silver). He was in the grocery store at the time and made off with the gun before the police could find it. Eugene goes on a killing spree leaving behind spent cartridges that he has engraved with Margaret's name. As more bodies pile up Mann pulls Margaret out of retirement so that he can use her as bait in the hopes of catching the killer. Margaret meets Eugene by accident and the two become lovers. She has no idea that he is the one leaving her these messages. Curtis is strong in the lead role and Silver is legitimately scary as Eugene. The cat and mouse game between the two of them goes on a little too long especially once Margaret discovers who he is but that's more a complaint against having to endure more of Silver's creepiness than it is Bigelow's direction. The beautiful Elizabeth Pena is underused in a few scenes as Turner's best friend.

278102,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6301966899,trebe,"[0, 2]","Academy Award winner Kathryn Bigelow (Hurt Locker,Point Break) co-wrote and directed Blue Steel (1989), a violent and very pretentious crime drama that loses touch with reality quite early, pushes matters to extreme levels, and by the finish has completely flown off the rails.  There's plenty of action, and bold attempts to pump up the tension, but few signs of any intelligent thought, in the poorly written screenplay that incorporates nearly every trick in the book, to feature a badass female cop.Fresh out of the academy, New York City police officer Megan Turner (Jamie Lee Curtis,Halloween,True Lies) is on patrol with her partner, when she discovers a robbery occurring in a store.  She confronts a man who is holding a gun on a cashier, and shoots him when he fails to put down his weapon.  The robber's revolver falls on the floor, where it is secretly taken by stockbroker Eugene Hunt (Ron Silver,Timecop), who was shopping in the store.Hunt leaves the crime scene with the weapon.  Lacking physical evidence, Turner is suspended, but after the mentally unbalanced Hunt kills a stranger, and leaves behind bullet casings with Megan's name scratched on them, police detective Nick Mann (Clancy Brown) has Turner reinstated with the rank of detective, so she can work the case.Firmly fixated on Megan, Hunt begins a relationship with her, while he continues to kill in her name.  The movie takes a dramatic turn near the halfway point, when Hunt unexpectedly reveals himself to Turner.  The remainder of the film features Turner and Mann attempting to bring Hunt to justice, as the stockbroker displays an uncanny ability to stay several steps ahead of the police.Credibility is an early casualty, as Blue Steel is built upon a series of unlikely events, that become increasingly ridiculous, as a green rookie cop with a bad attitude, almost instantaneously has the confidence of an experienced detective, and the balls to break protocol when it suits her purpose.  Things get increasingly personal after Hunt reveals himself, as he zeros in on her friends and family.  Turner is incapable of saving a friend from harm, but she's like a manic when she has a gun in her hand.  Being able to cut loose and overplay their roles was probably a blast for Silver and Curtis, and the movie is entertaining for a while, but if reality matters, at a certain point, it all gets to be too much.Not unlike a myriad of other violent crime dramas from the era, Blue Steel entertains in a superficial and pretentious way.  Featuring a female as the lead character was different for 1989, but the implausible clich&eacute; heavy story, fails to make Blue Steel the groundbreaker it might have been.  The film has kind of faded into obscurity, but if Jamie Lee Curtis making like Harry Callahan and administering vigilante justice sounds like fun, this is definitely a must see.
