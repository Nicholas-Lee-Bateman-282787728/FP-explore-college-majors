One of my musical heroes interviewing many other music giants with the sole purpose of providing the audience a deeper insight than one would normally get from spot interviewers.I won't go into the details of the show, that has been reviewed before.  I just wanted to clarify something regarding the extras.  When I read there were bonus interviews included, I was extremely excited.  Last year when Elvis discussed the making of the show and some of the unfortunate edits that went into the process of cutting a show down to an hour long, he specifically referenced having to snip FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES from Smokey Robinson's response to the writing process for ""Just My Soul Responding"".  I thought for sure this release would take advantage of not having this time restraint and add that footage (as well as for other artists) back in.  And when I read there were bonus interviews, I figured that was what was going on.But the additional interviews are actually just that.  Additional interviews that weren't conducted by Elvis as part of the show.  Not that there's anything wrong with including these either, they are a welcome addition.  But if the time restraints have been lifted, why not put additional material back into the extras as well?  Isn't that supposed to be one of the biggest perks for nerds like me who want to hear it all?That being said, this is a wonderful series.  I believe Elvis stated that Season 2 would be his last, and that's really unfortunate.  There are so many other great artists I would love to see interviewed in this format.There are also four complete bonus songs as well, including the full version of Elton's Ballad of a Well Known Gun with James burton playing lead.  The stuff of dreams.....Alas, we must be happy with what we have here.",4,One star deduction for the lack of some key extras,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,1841,"['love', 'series', 'love', 'simplicity', 'concept', 'One', 'musical', 'heroes', 'interviewing', 'many', 'other', 'music', 'giants', 'sole', 'purpose', 'providing', 'audience', 'deeper', 'insight', 'one', 'would', 'normally', 'get', 'spot', 'interviewers.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'show', 'been', 'reviewed', 'just', 'wanted', 'clarify', 'something', 'regarding', 'extras', 'When', 'read', 'were', 'bonus', 'interviews', 'included', 'was', 'extremely', 'excited', 'Last', 'year', 'when', 'Elvis', 'discussed', 'making', 'show', 'unfortunate', 'edits', 'went', 'process', 'cutting', 'show', 'down', 'hour', 'long', 'specifically', 'referenced', 'having', 'snip', 'FOUR', 'OR', 'FIVE', 'MINUTES', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'response', 'writing', 'process', 'Just', 'My', 'Soul', 'Responding', 'thought', 'sure', 'release', 'would', 'take', 'advantage', 'not', 'having', 'time', 'restraint', 'add', 'footage', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'artists', 'back', 'when', 'read', 'were', 'bonus', 'interviews', 'figured', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'additional', 'interviews', 'are', 'actually', 'just', 'Additional', 'interviews', 'were', ""n't"", 'conducted', 'Elvis', 'part', 'show', 'Not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'including', 'are', 'welcome', 'addition', 'time', 'restraints', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'why', 'not', 'put', 'additional', 'material', 'back', 'extras', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'that', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'biggest', 'perks', 'nerds', 'who', 'want', 'hear', 'being', 'said', 'wonderful', 'series', 'believe', 'Elvis', 'stated', 'Season', '2', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'really', 'unfortunate', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'artists', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'interviewed', 'are', 'also', 'four', 'complete', 'bonus', 'songs', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'full', 'version', 'Elton', 'Ballad', 'Well', 'Known', 'Gun', 'James', 'burton', 'playing', 'lead', 'stuff', 'dreams', '..Alas', 'must', 'be', 'happy', 'what', 'have', 'here']",N/A
1271407,A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ,B002JI94VC,Peter Tsang,"[0, 0]","On one episode, there is actually an interview with President William Jefferson Clinton.  The President talks about his passion for music and its influence on his life.  Not everyone knows that a long time ago, he was a most promising talent and was seriously considering a career in music.  He, of course, chose a different path and destiny.  This is a must see interview and an opportunity to see the President's wonderful musical gift.  It's nice to see a different side to the President's many different achievements.Whom else could you ever want to see and hear?  Other great guests include Sir Elton John, Smokey Robinson, John Mellencamp, The Police, and Tony Bennett.P.S. Don't forget to order Season 2.  It includes Sheryl Crow, Bruce Springsteen, and Bono.",5,Informative,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,766,"['one', 'episode', 'actually', 'interview', 'President', 'William', 'Jefferson', 'Clinton', 'President', 'talks', 'passion', 'music', 'influence', 'life', 'Not', 'everyone', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'was', 'most', 'promising', 'talent', 'was', 'seriously', 'considering', 'career', 'music', 'course', 'chose', 'different', 'path', 'destiny', 'must', 'see', 'interview', 'opportunity', 'see', 'President', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'gift', 'nice', 'see', 'different', 'side', 'President', 'many', 'different', 'achievements.Whom', 'else', 'could', 'ever', 'want', 'see', 'hear', 'Other', 'great', 'guests', 'include', 'Sir', 'Elton', 'John', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'John', 'Mellencamp', 'Police', 'Tony', 'Bennett.P.S', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'order', 'Season', '2', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'Bono']",N/A

1271409,A13IKSGDYNBNQS,B002JI94VC,S J Buck,"[3, 3]","This is an intelligent music show where one professional musician interviews others.The first episode I watched on recieving the set was the Diana Krall one, who is interviewed by Elton John rather than Elvis Costello. She talked movingly about her friendship with Oscar Peterson, in the last five years of his life, as well as her love for many kinds of music. She also played some swinging Jazz Piano. Elton interviewed her from the side of the Piano loving every moment of it.Elvis Costello may have started as part of the post punk new wave movement, but has matured into a musician who can do it all. In general he gets more out of the guests than any normal talk-show host would. As well as interviews there are also some fabulous musical collaborations. Watching the Elton John interview last night it was amazing to see Allen Toussaint on Hammond organ and James Burton on guitar in the backing band as Elvis and Elton sang a David Ackles song.Other guests include The Police, James Taylor, Herbie Hancock, Pat Methany, Tony Bennett, Rufus Wainwright and Ex-President Bill Clinton.In the UK this is on 5 DVD's with a total running time of 650 minutes, so although the price may look expensive it is actually good value for money. I can't recommend it highly enough.",5,Excellent music show,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,1273,"['intelligent', 'music', 'show', 'where', 'one', 'professional', 'musician', 'interviews', 'others.The', 'first', 'episode', 'watched', 'recieving', 'set', 'was', 'Diana', 'Krall', 'one', 'who', 'interviewed', 'Elton', 'John', 'rather', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'talked', 'movingly', 'friendship', 'Oscar', 'Peterson', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'many', 'kinds', 'music', 'also', 'played', 'swinging', 'Jazz', 'Piano', 'Elton', 'interviewed', 'side', 'Piano', 'loving', 'moment', 'it.Elvis', 'Costello', 'may', 'have', 'started', 'part', 'post', 'punk', 'new', 'wave', 'movement', 'matured', 'musician', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'general', 'more', 'guests', 'normal', 'talk-show', 'host', 'would', 'As', 'well', 'interviews', 'are', 'also', 'fabulous', 'musical', 'collaborations', 'Watching', 'Elton', 'John', 'interview', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'amazing', 'see', 'Allen', 'Toussaint', 'Hammond', 'organ', 'James', 'Burton', 'guitar', 'backing', 'band', 'Elvis', 'Elton', 'sang', 'David', 'Ackles', 'guests', 'include', 'Police', 'James', 'Taylor', 'Herbie', 'Hancock', 'Pat', 'Methany', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'Rufus', 'Wainwright', 'Ex-President', 'Bill', 'Clinton.In', 'UK', '5', 'DVD', 'total', 'running', 'time', '650', 'minutes', 'so', 'price', 'may', 'look', 'expensive', 'actually', 'good', 'value', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough']",N/A
