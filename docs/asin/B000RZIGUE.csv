1084468,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000RZIGUE,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[6, 6]","If you haven't seen The Stand, the King miniseries that was originally televised in 1994, then this DVD set is worth your price of admission.  Unfortunately, The Stand is no longer being sold on its own (it is actually out of print for some ridiculous reason), so when my husband came to Amazon to buy me the DVD to replace the VHS that I had originally taped directly off of the television, he was forced to purchase this set.  I have broken down each of the offerings in this gift set below.1) The Stand.  This 4-part series was amazingly well-done for a TV miniseries, perhaps because the teleplay was written by Stephen King himself.  It is supremely well-cast, starring Gary Sinise (just before he hit it big in Forrest Gump), a comeback role for Rob Lowe, and excellent supporting performances by Bill Faberbakke (of Coach fame), Miguel Ferrer, and Jamey Sheridan as the Dark Man himself.  (Notice that I didn't mention Molly Ringwald; for me, having her play Frannie was the movie's one misfire.)  The movie stays fairly close to King's beloved novel, from the initial devastation to the stunning conclusion.  Grade: A2) The Langoliers.  This TV movie, which aired in 1995, was based on a novella by the same name that was originally published in King's book Four Past Midnight.  The story itself is interesting and involves time--basically, what happens to yesterday once we move on?  Unfortunately, the concept is simply not well-executed here.  The presence of various name actors--Patricia Wettig of Thirty Something, Dean Stockwell of Quantum Leap, Bronson Pinchot of Perfect Strangers, and David Morse, who went on to star in King's The Green Mile--are not enough to overcome the cheesy dialogue and overly contrived scenes.  Plus, there are small things that are simply done poorly:  at one point, a character is mortally wounded, and not only does the blood remain on that person's lips for hours (i.e, no one has the decency to simply wipe it off?) but also it remains a wet, bright red color rather than drying naturally.  This movie is watchable, although just barely.  Grade: C3) Golden Years.  This series was written by King (and others) originally for television, and it was first broadcast during the summer of 1991.  It is about four hours long on two discs, although it originally aired as seven individual ""episodes.""  The basic premise here is that an explosion in a top-secret laboratory exposes an old janitor to some unknown, experimental chemicals.  In addition to the old man, the characters include his confused wife (it seems that her every other line is ""I don't understand""), a mad scientist, and a psychopathic killer from ""the shop"" (a.k.a. the CIA).  Neither Oscar-nominated actress Felicity Huffmann, playing the head of security at the plant, or excellent character actor Stephen Root (from Office Space) can save this dull mess.  The story is overly drawn-out, and the majority of the plot is predictable--that is, with the exception of the ending, which just sort of occurs without ever explaining anything that happened.  Grade: DDespite the fact that The Stand is the only decent offering in this set, I am still tempted to give it 5-stars, as I think The Stand alone is worthy of that rating.  However, I would have much preferred to buy The Stand as a stand-alone (no pun intended!) DVD, so I just can't give this set 5 stars, as the price is rather high to pay for The Stand alone.  Furthermore, NONE of the features on this set offer any DVD extras, which was a bit of a disappointment.  Still, I am glad to be able to finally own The Stand on DVD and would definitely recommend this set for that reason alone.",4,Worthwhile for The Stand alone,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,3659,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Stand', 'King', 'miniseries', 'was', 'originally', 'televised', '1994', 'then', 'DVD', 'set', 'price', 'admission', 'Unfortunately', 'Stand', 'no', 'longer', 'being', 'sold', 'own', 'actually', 'print', 'ridiculous', 'reason', 'so', 'when', 'husband', 'came', 'Amazon', 'buy', 'DVD', 'replace', 'VHS', 'had', 'originally', 'taped', 'directly', 'television', 'was', 'forced', 'purchase', 'set', 'have', 'broken', 'down', 'offerings', 'gift', 'set', 'below.1', 'Stand', '4-part', 'series', 'was', 'amazingly', 'well-done', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'perhaps', 'teleplay', 'was', 'written', 'Stephen', 'King', 'supremely', 'well-cast', 'starring', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'just', 'hit', 'big', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'comeback', 'role', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Bill', 'Faberbakke', 'Coach', 'fame', 'Miguel', 'Ferrer', 'Jamey', 'Sheridan', 'Dark', 'Man', 'Notice', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'having', 'play', 'Frannie', 'was', 'movie', 'one', 'misfire', 'movie', 'fairly', 'close', 'King', 'beloved', 'novel', 'initial', 'devastation', 'stunning', 'conclusion', 'Grade', 'A2', 'Langoliers', 'TV', 'movie', 'aired', '1995', 'was', 'based', 'novella', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'originally', 'published', 'King', 'book', 'Four', 'Past', 'Midnight', 'story', 'interesting', 'time', 'basically', 'what', 'yesterday', 'move', 'Unfortunately', 'concept', 'simply', 'not', 'well-executed', 'here', 'presence', 'various', 'name', 'actors', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'Thirty', 'Something', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Bronson', 'Pinchot', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'David', 'Morse', 'who', 'went', 'star', 'King', 'Green', 'Mile', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'overcome', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'overly', 'contrived', 'scenes', 'are', 'small', 'things', 'are', 'simply', 'done', 'poorly', 'one', 'point', 'character', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'not', 'only', 'blood', 'remain', 'person', 'lips', 'hours', 'i.e', 'one', 'decency', 'simply', 'wipe', 'off', 'also', 'wet', 'bright', 'red', 'color', 'rather', 'drying', 'naturally', 'movie', 'watchable', 'just', 'barely', 'Grade', 'C3', 'Golden', 'Years', 'series', 'was', 'written', 'King', 'others', 'originally', 'television', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'summer', '1991', 'four', 'hours', 'long', 'two', 'discs', 'originally', 'aired', 'seven', 'individual', 'episodes', 'basic', 'premise', 'here', 'explosion', 'top-secret', 'laboratory', 'old', 'janitor', 'unknown', 'experimental', 'chemicals', 'addition', 'old', 'man', 'characters', 'include', 'confused', 'wife', 'other', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'mad', 'scientist', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'shop', 'a.k.a', 'CIA', 'Oscar-nominated', 'actress', 'Felicity', 'Huffmann', 'playing', 'head', 'security', 'plant', 'excellent', 'character', 'actor', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'Office', 'Space', 'can', 'save', 'dull', 'mess', 'story', 'overly', 'drawn-out', 'majority', 'plot', 'predictable', 'exception', 'ending', 'just', 'sort', 'occurs', 'ever', 'explaining', 'anything', 'happened', 'Grade', 'DDespite', 'fact', 'Stand', 'only', 'decent', 'offering', 'set', 'am', 'still', 'tempted', 'give', '5-stars', 'think', 'Stand', 'alone', 'worthy', 'rating', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'preferred', 'buy', 'Stand', 'stand-alone', 'pun', 'intended', 'DVD', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'set', '5', 'stars', 'price', 'rather', 'high', 'pay', 'Stand', 'alone', 'Furthermore', 'NONE', 'features', 'set', 'offer', 'DVD', 'extras', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'Still', 'am', 'glad', 'be', 'able', 'finally', 'own', 'Stand', 'DVD', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'set', 'reason', 'alone']",Stephen King Gift Set: (The Langoliers / The Stand / Golden Years)

I had heard of ""The Langoliers"" and ""The Stand,"" but I'd never heard of ""Golden Years.""  What a surprise this would be for my sweetie!It was so funny when the next day my wife came screaming into my home office and said, ""Honey, you're never gonna believe this, I just found three more Stephen King movies!""  Playing dumb, I replied, ""Oh yeah, which ones?""  Then she named all the movies in this set.  I sheepishly replied, ""Did you get 'em all together in one package for a pretty good price?""  The look back was memorable because she realized I had already ordered it for her.  No doghouse for me that night!  :DIf you're a Stephen King/sci-fi/horror fan, then GET THIS SET!  ""Golden Years"" is more obscure than the others, but my wife LOVED it, too!  It's very affordable when they get sets like these together for one price.  Maybe one day somebody will get real ambitious and put together the quintessential Stephen King collection with ALL of his movies in one package.  Oh, wait a minute, we almost have that NOW!  HA!

1084488,A1QPQFNR8CV62G,B000RZIGUE,MaiTai,"[2, 2]","If you love all things Stephen King including his miniseries you'll love this set. At roughly $10.00 and some change per miniseries you get:The Stand - the made-for-TV miniseries about one of King's most famous novels. This one is a classic Good versus Evil or should I say God versus Devil crossed with the whole end of the world thanks to our military and government trying to play their own version of God. It remained fairly true to the book and most of the actors played their parts perfectly with the exception, at least for me, of Molly Ringwald being Frannie. I had a bit of a hard time wrapping my wits around that one, because Frannie in the book is your more classically beautiful, kickbutt redhead and Molly Ringwald was just a little too young and fragile to really make me believe she was indeed Frannie, a woman who in the book I really admired. And what was with the black bob hairstyle? But other than that everyone else was pretty much looked and sounded the way I'd always imagined them from the book. The actor who played Randall Flagg especially, he absolutely nailed the gleeful insanity of a man who isn't, well really a man at all.The Langoliers - I saw this one TV years ago and fell in love with it. It's stands out to me as one of the few times I've ever seen a written story nearly perfectly duplicated on film. The original novella is from King's book of stories ""Four Past Midnight."" In this story a small group of ten people wake up during a night-time flight to Boston to discover they seem to be the only ones left on the plane, now being flown only on autopilot. Even weirder are the objects they find left behind by the other passengers--anything non-organic to be specific including jewelry, coins, pacemakers, dental bridges and yes even a wig. The mystery of where they are and what happened to everyone else is one of King's more riveting and well-done mysteries with a sci-fi twist to it.Golden Years - I'd never seen this miniseries and King actually wrote it specifically for TV as a miniseries, meaning itand I'd never heard Golden Years, but love it in spite of itself. It has a few minor plot holes and the acting is honestly not the greatest, but keep in mind that a) this is a miniseries from 1991, so everything looks very dated because honestly it is and b) the acting feels way overdone, because it is somewhat in the style of TV shows during that period. If you watch other TV shows in that time period you'll see what I mean. The story itself, as with all things King, involves an unlikely group of people drawn together in the fight between right and wrong. This time an elderly janitor and his wife find themselves the target of a ruthless government agency after an accident at work exposes the old man to a substance that may just be a genuine fountain of youth. There's plenty of fun with a classic mad scientist, several military types who take themselves way too seriously, a rather interesting young woman who once worked for The Shop aka CIA and a ruthless government assassin who really does look like the kind of guy you'd roll your windows up and lock your doors if he walked over to your vehicle. Throw in a sci-fi twist and it's all good fun, SK style.Each miniseries comes to about $10.00 and some change, the DVDs played perfectly and take up very little space as they all come in one slim case. And they all have subtitles, which my sometimes hard-of-hearing hubby really appreciates. This set now has a permanent residence next to my Kingdom Hospital and The Shining miniseries and all I can do is pray there will be more miniseries in the future.

1084493,A3PKYCD2WJL94H,B000RZIGUE,"M. Williams ""Ghost Writer""","[2, 4]","With over 105 Stephen King adaptations - and sequels - currently avaiable or in production, there are going to be more than just a few that are of a poor standard --- it's just the law of averages.  But value-for-money when it comes to the approximate running length of a King movie is always gauranteed [and taking into account the average novel or novella written by King, these still are not long enough to encompass the entire work].This box set is no exception to the rule of King.On offer here are three mini-series in one box set, the running time comprising of roughly 40 hours [broken down: The Stand(6 hrs), The Golden Years (5 Hours) and The Langoliers (3 hrs). Enough entertainment to keep the average horror fan entertained for days. Or is there?I think there is here.Let's begin with the strongest movie first, 'The Stand'. Based on King's best-selling apocalyptic epic novel, this movie stays as close the novel as possible. Directed by Mick Garris [Riding the Bullet], the movie has a talented and well-chosen cast, including Rob Lowe [Salem's Lot TV], Molly Ringwald, Ed Harris [Needful Things; The Creepshow] and Gary Sinise. A man-made virus has wiped out the population of America, except for two surviving groups: those who follow Mother Abigail, a servant of God and those who follow Randall Flagg, suggested here as being the Devil. The movie tracks each character in detail right through to the climactic finale. 'The Stand' successfully portrays a world on the brink of ruin, conveying each individual surviving character's battle with their newfound circumstances; their inner fight between the forces of good and evil. Apart for 'Stand By Me' and 'Shawshank Redemption' this is probably the finest adaptation of a King novel.'The Langoliers' tells of an airliner that has flown through the Aurora Borealis [the Northern Lights] --- those left on the plane are the passengers who, at the time, were asleep. But now the population of America has apparently vanished --- there is no air traffic and the airports are deserted. As with all King stories, there are strong and believable characters who struggle to understand - and survive in - a complex and horrific situation, character development being a particular strong point of this author. Creepy and tense throughout, this film never fails to entertain those who enjoy the mysterious in life.Probably the weakest of the three is 'The Langoliers'. This is the tale of retired ex-guard, Harlan Williams, who once worked at a secluded scientific research center. Returning one day, he is caught up in an explosion and is contaminated. His ageing process is subsequently reversed. Understandably curious, the government workers begin a man hunt in order to discover the secret to eternal youth. The film is a well-made sci-fi-horror with a strong cast headed by Ed Lauter [Cujo].The Stephen King Gift Set is excellent value for money, considering these movies retail at high prices individually.",5,The Stand; The Langoliers; The Golen Years [14 hrs],1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,2971,"['105', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptations', 'sequels', 'currently', 'avaiable', 'production', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'few', 'are', 'poor', 'standard', 'just', 'law', 'averages', 'value-for-money', 'when', 'approximate', 'running', 'length', 'King', 'movie', 'always', 'gauranteed', '[', 'taking', 'account', 'average', 'novel', 'novella', 'written', 'King', 'still', 'are', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'encompass', 'entire', 'work', ']', '.This', 'box', 'set', 'exception', 'rule', 'King.On', 'offer', 'here', 'are', 'three', 'mini-series', 'one', 'box', 'set', 'running', 'time', 'comprising', 'roughly', '40', 'hours', '[', 'broken', 'down', 'Stand', '6', 'hrs', 'Golden', 'Years', '5', 'Hours', 'Langoliers', '3', 'hrs', 'Enough', 'entertainment', 'keep', 'average', 'horror', 'fan', 'entertained', 'days', 'there', 'think', 'here.Let', 'begin', 'strongest', 'movie', 'first', 'Stand', 'Based', 'King', 'best-selling', 'apocalyptic', 'epic', 'novel', 'movie', 'close', 'novel', 'possible', 'Directed', 'Mick', 'Garris', '[', 'Riding', 'Bullet', ']', 'movie', 'talented', 'well-chosen', 'cast', 'including', 'Rob', 'Lowe', '[', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'TV', ']', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Ed', 'Harris', '[', 'Needful', 'Things', 'Creepshow', ']', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'man-made', 'virus', 'wiped', 'out', 'population', 'America', 'two', 'surviving', 'groups', 'who', 'follow', 'Mother', 'Abigail', 'servant', 'God', 'who', 'follow', 'Randall', 'Flagg', 'suggested', 'here', 'being', 'Devil', 'movie', 'character', 'detail', 'right', 'climactic', 'finale', ""'The"", 'Stand', 'successfully', 'world', 'brink', 'ruin', 'conveying', 'individual', 'surviving', 'character', 'battle', 'newfound', 'circumstances', 'inner', 'fight', 'forces', 'good', 'evil', 'Apart', ""'Stand"", 'Me', 'Redemption', 'probably', 'finest', 'adaptation', 'King', 'novel', 'Langoliers', 'tells', 'airliner', 'flown', 'Aurora', 'Borealis', '[', 'Northern', 'Lights', ']', 'left', 'plane', 'are', 'passengers', 'who', 'time', 'were', 'asleep', 'now', 'population', 'America', 'apparently', 'vanished', 'air', 'traffic', 'airports', 'are', 'deserted', 'King', 'stories', 'are', 'strong', 'believable', 'characters', 'who', 'struggle', 'understand', 'survive', 'complex', 'horrific', 'situation', 'character', 'development', 'being', 'particular', 'strong', 'point', 'author', 'Creepy', 'tense', 'film', 'never', 'entertain', 'who', 'enjoy', 'mysterious', 'life.Probably', 'weakest', 'three', ""'The"", 'Langoliers', 'tale', 'retired', 'ex-guard', 'Harlan', 'Williams', 'who', 'once', 'worked', 'secluded', 'scientific', 'research', 'center', 'Returning', 'one', 'day', 'caught', 'up', 'explosion', 'contaminated', 'ageing', 'process', 'subsequently', 'reversed', 'Understandably', 'curious', 'government', 'workers', 'begin', 'man', 'hunt', 'order', 'discover', 'secret', 'eternal', 'youth', 'film', 'well-made', 'sci-fi-horror', 'strong', 'cast', 'headed', 'Ed', 'Lauter', '[', 'Cujo', ']', '.The', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Gift', 'Set', 'excellent', 'value', 'money', 'considering', 'movies', 'retail', 'high', 'prices', 'individually']",Stephen King Gift Set: (The Langoliers / The Stand / Golden Years)
1084494,A25XGZX0YRTJKN,B000RZIGUE,Paul J. Moade,"[41, 43]","I'm not normally a big fan of collections or boxed sets ... preferring to buy each feature individually. Many times a collection has one or two good titles and the rest is filler.So why am I going against the grain here and giving this a favorable rating? Especially since I haven't seen ""The Golden Years"" yet?Because two of the included features are worth the price of the set. ""The Stand"" is arguably the best SK novel and probably one of the closest (to the novel) transfers to the TV screen. The plot hinges on a biological warfare mishap in which most of the human race is wiped out by ""Captain Trips"", a.k.a. the superflu. In the aftermath, two groups form, one following Mother Abigail as the disciples of the faithful; and one group following the ""Walking Dude"" as a representative of the darker powers (hell is never mentioned although the parallel is plain enough). Character development is well done, although not as complete as in the novel (go figure) and is primarily restricted to Mother Abigail's group. It is, however, more than we usually get in a novel to movie transfer. The story, while four hours long, needs every minute to guide us on what makes each person tick ... and it does this extremely well. Horror scenes, Stephan King style, are abundantly present and are well done cinematically. King has a gift of taking ordinary circumstances and twisting them into outlandish, dreadful nightmares.The second film, ""The Langoliers"", is cast in more of a sci-fi vein; albeit with the usual SK treatment of uncovering the darker side of human nature. The story revolves around a typical airline flight from Los Angels to Boston which literally flies `out of time' and `loses' everyone who was not asleep at the time of the event. Good thing there was a pilot napping as a passenger, eh?What happens to the light in a room when you turn off the switch? This movie explores that question. What DOES happen to the past? According to one of the character's father (Craig Toomey), it is eaten by the langoliers .... Beings which devour the inactive and useless in the world. These creatures look like large copies of Pacman with razor sharp teeth.  As the plane flies along and eventually lands, we see that the pace of the past winds down and eventually stops. The past is unpopulated by people, leading us to beleive that people march with time and have no presence in the past. Matches don't light or will only fizzle, fuel does not burn and beer is flat straight out of the bottle. The past sorta coasts along by momentum until it finally comes to a complete stop ... at which point the langoliers come in to erase it. Craig was always threatened by his ""go getter"" of a father that lazy, useless boys are eaten by the langoliers. Now the threat comes to life for the passengers from the plane as the munching sound gets closer and closer. Again, this is a very entertaining film well worth watching.Going by the reviews of others, ""The Golden Years"" falls flat. Haven't seen this one for myself, so I'll have to pass on judgement. Read the other reviews and make your own determination.Bottom line is that for a reasonable price, there are at least two SK winners - and possibly a third (reviews are, after all, just opinions). I would say that this is a worthwhile purchase and will provide hours of entertainment.As word to the wise - ""The Langoliers"" is probably not a movie for younger kids (under the age of 10) unless you want to stay up with them for several sleepless nights. Younger ones probably won't understand ""The Stand"", but some of the scenes will shock and scare them. You might want to view these films yourself first before letting your kids sit in on a family room viewing.Cheerfully Recommended.~P~",4,"Try it, You may like it.",1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,3739,"[""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'big', 'fan', 'collections', 'boxed', 'sets', 'preferring', 'buy', 'feature', 'individually', 'Many', 'times', 'collection', 'one', 'two', 'good', 'titles', 'rest', 'filler.So', 'why', 'am', 'going', 'grain', 'here', 'giving', 'favorable', 'rating', 'Especially', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Golden', 'Years', 'yet', 'two', 'included', 'features', 'are', 'price', 'set', 'Stand', 'arguably', 'best', 'SK', 'novel', 'probably', 'one', 'closest', 'novel', 'transfers', 'TV', 'screen', 'plot', 'biological', 'warfare', 'mishap', 'most', 'human', 'race', 'wiped', 'out', 'Captain', 'Trips', 'a.k.a', 'superflu', 'aftermath', 'two', 'groups', 'form', 'one', 'following', 'Mother', 'Abigail', 'disciples', 'faithful', 'one', 'group', 'following', 'Walking', 'Dude', 'representative', 'darker', 'powers', 'hell', 'never', 'mentioned', 'parallel', 'plain', 'enough', 'Character', 'development', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'as', 'complete', 'novel', 'go', 'figure', 'primarily', 'restricted', 'Mother', 'Abigail', 'group', 'however', 'more', 'usually', 'get', 'novel', 'movie', 'transfer', 'story', 'four', 'hours', 'long', 'needs', 'minute', 'guide', 'what', 'person', 'tick', 'extremely', 'well', 'Horror', 'scenes', 'Stephan', 'King', 'style', 'are', 'abundantly', 'present', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'cinematically', 'King', 'gift', 'taking', 'ordinary', 'circumstances', 'twisting', 'outlandish', 'dreadful', 'nightmares.The', 'second', 'film', 'Langoliers', 'cast', 'more', 'sci-fi', 'vein', 'usual', 'SK', 'treatment', 'uncovering', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'story', 'around', 'typical', 'airline', 'flight', 'Los', 'Angels', 'Boston', 'literally', 'time', 'loses', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'asleep', 'time', 'event', 'Good', 'thing', 'was', 'pilot', 'napping', 'passenger', 'eh', 'What', 'light', 'room', 'when', 'turn', 'off', 'switch', 'movie', 'question', 'What', 'DOES', 'happen', 'past', 'According', 'one', 'character', 'father', 'Craig', 'Toomey', 'eaten', 'langoliers', 'Beings', 'devour', 'inactive', 'useless', 'world', 'creatures', 'look', 'large', 'copies', 'Pacman', 'razor', 'sharp', 'teeth', 'plane', 'flies', 'eventually', 'lands', 'see', 'pace', 'past', 'winds', 'down', 'eventually', 'stops', 'past', 'unpopulated', 'people', 'leading', 'beleive', 'people', 'march', 'time', 'have', 'presence', 'past', 'Matches', 'do', ""n't"", 'light', 'will', 'only', 'fizzle', 'fuel', 'not', 'burn', 'beer', 'flat', 'straight', 'bottle', 'past', 'sorta', 'coasts', 'momentum', 'finally', 'complete', 'stop', 'point', 'langoliers', 'come', 'erase', 'Craig', 'was', 'always', 'threatened', 'go', 'getter', 'father', 'useless', 'boys', 'are', 'eaten', 'langoliers', 'Now', 'threat', 'life', 'passengers', 'plane', 'munching', 'sound', 'closer', 'closer', 'Again', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'well', 'watching.Going', 'reviews', 'others', 'Golden', 'Years', 'flat', 'Have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'pass', 'judgement', 'Read', 'other', 'reviews', 'make', 'own', 'determination.Bottom', 'line', 'reasonable', 'price', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'SK', 'winners', 'possibly', 'third', 'reviews', 'are', 'just', 'opinions', 'would', 'say', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'will', 'provide', 'hours', 'entertainment.As', 'word', 'wise', 'Langoliers', 'probably', 'not', 'movie', 'younger', 'kids', 'age', '10', 'want', 'stay', 'up', 'several', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'Younger', 'ones', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Stand', 'scenes', 'will', 'shock', 'scare', 'might', 'want', 'view', 'films', 'first', 'letting', 'kids', 'sit', 'family', 'room', 'viewing.Cheerfully', 'Recommended.~P~']",Stephen King Gift Set: (The Langoliers / The Stand / Golden Years)

The Stand was difficult to connect the dots as some of the dots seemed to be missing. I didn't see this on T.V. (of which I am happy, as it would have been boring with the commercials), so I don't know if they dropped some scenes or this was just lousy directing.  The sound track in the first section was horrible and the piano 'player' on the third section should have been shot to ease his pain.  This movie is about Good and evil, except that in our real world,  God""s way to end evil will be a whole lot worse for mankind if we don't repent, starting with that dicator in the White House.  Golden Years (about a man that is getting younger) was very enjoyable, but sadly, parts of it could be too true with all of the radical people that have fire-arms and power and the government that is now in control.  None of these movies are for the young and with Stephen King, you will never know who he will eliminate.

Then I found this set and saw what it ran here and thought this is great. I saw it in another place and the retail on it is a lot more, making me think this is a steal. I really couldn't be happier.(talking about all but the Golden Years)In the three movies, you have some of the same types of thread. In the Langoliers, you meet a plane filled with people who are on their way to - whereever. They fall asleep, and when they awaken they are on a plane by themselves. They think it is odd at first, and then find it odder that there are pieces of jewelry and pieces of artifical implants that people seem to have lost. This leads to some even more bizarre disclosures as they find an abandoned airport and notice the sound, the chewing sound, closing in on the horizon.In The Stand, we begin with a man trying to get his family out of the middle of a government facility. He gets out, and he helps a passenger get out as well that goes by Captain Tripps. The captain spreads quickly, and people seem to be on the brink of doom. Then comes Flagg, something not human, and his calling that brings people to Vegas. Others here someone different, and they go to Colorado. As they rebuild, they find themselves confronted with not only life and death, but with the thing that will decide what happens to us all. A call to Stand, as it were, and fight for everything.The Golden Years is another one of the end of the world scenarios, and it is good. I liked it and I liked the casting, not to mention the production value. The editorial does it justice, and it is the second longest piece in the set. Consdiering we are talking about ten hours plus for this set, we are talking a good value. Plus you get The Stand, one of the best made-for-TV movies I have ever seen (and one of the most expensive).If you have yet to get these, you should. They goout of print quickly, and are well worth watching. As a whole I rate this a 5 star, and opinions differ on what it rates as shows.
