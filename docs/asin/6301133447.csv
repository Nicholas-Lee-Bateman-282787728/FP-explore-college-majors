Tim Curry's portrayal of a tv evangelist is a top-notch performance, with a supporting cast that's every bit as good.  Annie Potts plays the Reverend's sincerely supporting wife who likes to dress us as Biblical characters and put on skits for the congregation in various states of undress... but all in the name of the lord.When Bill Paxton and crew visit the Tower of Bethlehem with the intent to rob Reverend Ray of some of that cash his tv congregation pledges to the ""call girls"", all Hell breaks loose and it's pure heaven in entertainmnt for anyone who can appreciate an irreverent sense of humor.  And in fact, there's a one-liner in the film that had me choking for an hour.  ""They're gonna...""  Heh.  I won't spoil it.  Ya need to rent it or buy it on eBay or borrow it from a friend.  That one line alone is worth whatever you'll pay for the VHS.I don't know why this film isn't avalable on DVD - quite possibly because it offended every religious fanatic who thinks those tv evangelist programs are real.  (Yup, professional wrestling is real, too, my friends).There is absolutely nothing sacred about Pass the Ammo, and that is a large part of its charm.",5,Nothing Sacred Here!,1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,1328,"['far', 'one', 'most', 'offensive', 'off-color', 'anti-organized-religion', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'reason', 'top', 'favorites', 'list', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'portrayal', 'tv', 'evangelist', 'top-notch', 'performance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'bit', 'good', 'Annie', 'Potts', 'Reverend', 'sincerely', 'supporting', 'wife', 'who', 'dress', 'Biblical', 'characters', 'put', 'skits', 'congregation', 'various', 'states', 'undress', 'name', 'lord.When', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'crew', 'visit', 'Tower', 'Bethlehem', 'intent', 'rob', 'Reverend', 'Ray', 'cash', 'tv', 'congregation', 'pledges', 'call', 'girls', 'Hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'pure', 'heaven', 'entertainmnt', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'irreverent', 'sense', 'humor', 'fact', 'one-liner', 'film', 'had', 'choking', 'hour', ""'re"", 'gon', 'Heh', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'Ya', 'need', 'rent', 'buy', 'eBay', 'borrow', 'friend', 'one', 'line', 'alone', 'worth', ""'ll"", 'pay', 'VHS.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'film', ""n't"", 'avalable', 'DVD', 'quite', 'possibly', 'offended', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'who', 'tv', 'evangelist', 'programs', 'are', 'real', 'Yup', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'real', 'too', 'friends', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'sacred', 'Pass', 'Ammo', 'large', 'part', 'charm']",N/A

It's about, basically, the same matter.Scheming Reverend Ray Porter and his ever-faithful wife run a  Television Evangalism Ministry. Ray's making millions for his own enjoyment  while his ministry is nothing more than a cult-like broadway show. One of  his followers and her boyfriend and cousins decide they want their donated  money back.PASS THE AMMO is full of laughs from beginning to end, but  lacks pace in all-too-many places.Tim Curry was wonderful as Rev. Ray.  Annie Potts was absolutely halarious as his wife. Linda Kozlowski and Bill  Paxton were also acceptable as their followers with a little mission of  their own.",4,Unique movie with an eclectic charm...,949968000,"02 8, 2000",2000,735,"['PASS', 'THE', 'AMMO', 'was', 'released', 'perfect', 'time', 'Right', 'time', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'Bakker', 'conflict', 'about', 'basically', 'same', 'matter.Scheming', 'Reverend', 'Ray', 'Porter', 'ever-faithful', 'wife', 'run', 'Television', 'Evangalism', 'Ministry', 'Ray', 'making', 'millions', 'own', 'enjoyment', 'ministry', 'nothing', 'more', 'cult-like', 'broadway', 'show', 'One', 'followers', 'boyfriend', 'cousins', 'decide', 'want', 'donated', 'money', 'THE', 'AMMO', 'full', 'laughs', 'beginning', 'end', 'pace', 'all-too-many', 'places.Tim', 'Curry', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Rev', 'Ray', 'Annie', 'Potts', 'was', 'absolutely', 'halarious', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Kozlowski', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'were', 'also', 'acceptable', 'followers', 'little', 'mission', 'own']",N/A

So when I heard him laughing aloud when I walked up on his porch I knew I wanted to see whatever movie was on. Come to find out he'd been watching it over and over for hours!! And now that I've seen it myself at least twenty times - all I can say is if you haven't seen this movie,  you haven't seen one of the funniest movies ever made. I believe this is the way God sees all bad guys, the crooks and the crooked ministers alike, with compassion and humor.

245590,A14OB7YKMPBJLW,6301133447,Susan Fong,"[2, 39]","The only reason I purchased this video was because I'm a fan of Annie Potts.  But even her talent is not enough to redeem ""Pass the Amo"".This movie is supposedly a ""comedy"" that parodies television evangelism.  Instead, it is an ultra-violent mess of a movie where the ""heroes"" brandish guns and threaten to kill innocent people if the crooked ministry does not return $50,000 of money which was wrongly donated to the church.The ""heroes"" succeed in retrieving their money as well as exposing the corrupt ministry.  But is the end supposed to justify the means?  I believe that this movie sends a horrible message that violence pays off.  Our real world is threatened daily by Al Qaida and other terrorists groups.  Gun-related murders and other crimes committed with guns are still rampant in our society.  Yet this movie seems to glorify violence rather than condemn it.I am NOT an anti-NRA person.  Most gunowners are responsible, law-abiding people.  But the message that ""Pass the Amo"" so disturbingly conveys is that violence does have its own rewards.  That message is not only in poor taste, it's downright unconsionable.
