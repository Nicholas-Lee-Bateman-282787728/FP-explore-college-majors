942460,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000BI1YT2,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","This review was originally written, in the main, for an Otis Rush DVD performance at his Chicago haunt, ""The Wise Fool Club"". Most of the points made for that review apply here as well.Okay, okay I have been talking about doing a review of the legendary electric blues guitarist Otis Rush ever since I saw him on some DVDs in the ""American Folk Blues ""series from the 1960's that I have reviewed elsewhere in this space. Arguably, the 1950's and 1960's were the heroic age of electric blues guitar with the likes of Muddy Waters, Hubert Sumlin (from Howlin' Wolf's band), Elmore James, the incredible T-Bone Walker and Brother Rush. What makes the case for his inclusion here is some very rippling solos where he runs the board.Sometimes the quality of live performances especially in the days before better sound production technology was developed, as here at the famous blues club the ""Wise Fool Club"", diminishes the quality of the sound. However, for a performer like Rush, having that live audience in front is the spark that takes them to flights of ....musical fancy. Put that together with Rush's deep, powerful voice to match the intensity of the riffs and a self-selected back up band and you have the blues when they are dos.You don't believe me? Well, listen to a smoking ""Sweet Little Angel"" or the pathos of ""Feel So Bad"". Or the pain of ""You're Breaking My Heart"" or the frenetic longing of the title song ""All Your Love I Miss Loving"". Case closed.Here at Montreaux Otis is joined by the great blue guitarist and promoter of the genre, Eric Clapton, and at the end by Luther Allison (who takes Otis and Eric to school on a couple of riffs, by the way).

Unfortunately, there were also some factors that really detracted from my enjoyment of the performance.  First of all, I hated the electric keyboards of Greg Phillinganes.  That noodling, mellotron sound, which was so popular in this 80s, is featured far too prominently in the mix to the extent that he even has several solos.  In addition, there is a giant dead spot in the middle of the show when Clapton performs several songs that were then new but which have not stood the test of time.  They are just not very good.  The song that Phillinganes leads with bassist Nathan East is simply awful.  A surprise highlight comes when Phil Collins leads the band in a performance of his classic ""In the Air Tonight,"" one of the few songs from his solo work that I care for.",3,Excellent Clapton burdened by 80s keyboards & material,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,876,"['Eric', 'Clapton', 'was', 'fine', 'voice', 'guitar-playing', 'was', 'top-notch', 'always', 'concert', '1986', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'also', 'factors', 'really', 'detracted', 'enjoyment', 'performance', 'First', 'hated', 'electric', 'keyboards', 'Greg', 'Phillinganes', 'noodling', 'mellotron', 'sound', 'was', 'so', 'popular', '80s', 'featured', 'far', 'too', 'prominently', 'mix', 'extent', 'even', 'several', 'solos', 'addition', 'giant', 'dead', 'spot', 'middle', 'show', 'when', 'Clapton', 'several', 'songs', 'were', 'then', 'new', 'have', 'not', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'song', 'bassist', 'Nathan', 'East', 'simply', 'awful', 'surprise', 'highlight', 'when', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'band', 'performance', 'classic', 'Air', 'Tonight', 'one', 'few', 'songs', 'solo', 'work', 'care']",N/A

I've waited for YEARS for any full video concerts of Talk Talk to surface, and finally, this one is here. For a twenty year old show, the sound is AMAZING (and even offers a 5.1 DTS option)! Definitely a most underrated band, and they add a lot of color and texture to their live songs, as opposed to bands who stand there and simply recreate their studio versions. Here, the three core members of the band flesh out their sound with extra guitarists, keyboardists and percussion, and it really pays off. However, this is not my favorite show. Not too long ago I ran across a DVD of the band playing in Salamanca, Spain on the same tour, and generally, an even better performace, and the venue itself (the Plaza Mayor) is just breathtaking, making for an even better concert experience. That's the show they should have released, or should at least consider doing next. Nevertheless, Talk Talk live on this DVD is a must-have for any fan of great 80's bands.

942482,A12S5XTMAHYYME,B000BI1YT2,Perry Celestino,"[14, 16]","Otis Rush, the West Side Bluesman, is one of the rarities of American Blues Music. Like Albert King, he is a self-taught left-handed guitarist who plays an upside down right-handed and strung guitar, has great innovative bends (especially Otis' signature ""lazy"" vibrato) and sings with a convincing passion. There is very little available for fans to see. In 2003 the ""Live Blues Part 1"" on Blues Express was released showing us an older, slower Mr Rush BUT with a fabulous band! I would highly recommend this set too!This DVD was eagerly awaited by all Blues fans. It was shot in 1986 and shows us a younger (52) Otis in his first of three Montreux performances between 1986 and 1996 (thanks to Eric Clapton). Otis had been to Europe with the AFBF in the 1960s and his input in those DVDs is very exciting. In this set he has the Professor Eddie Lusk Blues Review as his backup group and honestly-they are only adequate. Otis needs a horn section and a tighter drummer and bassist to bring out his sound. Otis himself sings great and puts over a very good overall performance. His guitar is a little thin and down in the mix. However we learn a few great things about his technique--like he plays a lot without a pick and also when he does pick he uses it from different sides and angles-pretty cool! And the most revealing item: his great vibrato is done not only with his ring finger-but also his forefinger. I'm sure this is where Mike Bloomfield picked it up-one of Mike's most distinctive licks!The set is very good and comprehensive for 1986. Many tunes are from his ""Right Place, Wrong Time"" LP. An LP that took ten years to be released. He starts with ""Tops"" which is from an album he recorded at the San Francisco Blues Festival and is probably his best live CD. Then he does his Earl Hooker signature tune ""I Wonder Why"" (or Blues in D Natural) which is a bit slow and underplayed by the bass and drummer. He then does Little Milton's ""Lonely Man"" and things pick up. This was also an Albert King tune and Otis further includes Albert's ""Crosscut Saw"" ""Let's Have a Natural Ball"" and the very nice ""You Don't Love Me""-done as Albert King's funkiest instrumental, Peter Green did it with the Bluesbreakers and Al Kooper did it on ""Super Session""-and later Gary Moore did it at Montreux in 1990. Otis does this tune excellent and laid back. Willie Cobb would have been proud.The tune ""Gambler's Blues"" shows Otis's excellence with the slow blues. This tune is a medley with ""It's My Own Fault"". These are both B.B. King tunes as well (a major Rush influence). T-Bone Walker's ""Mean Old World"" is offered a tune he did a lot in the 1970s -it's a bit uptempo and cool! Eric Clapton comes out and plays very well (with his Fender Custom Shop Strat in red to match Otis' ES-355 Gibson!). Much better on most of his latest efforts. He helps out on several Otis tunes and curiously opens the vocal on ""Double Trouble"". This is like coming to a Rolling Stones concert and another person playing the riff in ""Satisfaction"" instead of Keith Richards. This is strange! And Otis also has mike problems as well. Eric's guitar is a bit too thick but his phrasing is really excellent.The Rush signature tune ""All Your Love"" is really great-look out for the facial expression of the Lusk Band's guitar player, Tony Palmer (who, interestingly is featured in the new Jimmy Burns DVD! 20 years later!) watching Eric's solo, it's a classic!Luther Allison comes out and does one number. It is really a song tribute to Otis not really ""Everyday I Have the Blues""!! Luther over does it a bit I think and his guitar is way too distorted. But he was a Hendrix disciple!Any footage on the West Side Bluesmen is scarse. Freddie King has had several releases of which ""The...Beat"" is probably best-shows him in his pre-1970s period. Buddy Guy has had a lot of later material like ""Lightning In A Bottle"" but hardly anything from his early days (best is the DVD release with Muddy Waters and Junior Wells at Montreux: ""Messin' With The Blues"", in the early 1970s): Magic Sam only has only one recorded performance on the 2nd AFBF DVD. and Otis has the two mentioned in this review and a tune done in Scorsese's Blues Film ""Father's and Sons"" (as an extra).If you love Blues music pick up this DVD. A great record of Otis Rush's career and you'll see him younger than any other performance except the AFBF ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" in the 1960s.",5,More Footage Of The Rare Otis Rush,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,4423,"['Otis', 'Rush', 'West', 'Side', 'Bluesman', 'one', 'rarities', 'American', 'Blues', 'Music', 'Albert', 'King', 'self-taught', 'left-handed', 'guitarist', 'who', 'upside', 'down', 'right-handed', 'strung', 'guitar', 'great', 'innovative', 'bends', 'especially', 'Otis', 'signature', 'lazy', 'vibrato', 'sings', 'convincing', 'passion', 'very', 'little', 'available', 'fans', 'see', '2003', 'Live', 'Blues', 'Part', '1', 'Blues', 'Express', 'was', 'released', 'showing', 'older', 'slower', 'Mr', 'Rush', 'BUT', 'fabulous', 'band', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'too', 'DVD', 'was', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'Blues', 'fans', 'was', 'shot', '1986', 'younger', '52', 'Otis', 'first', 'three', 'Montreux', 'performances', '1986', '1996', 'thanks', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Otis', 'had', 'been', 'Europe', 'AFBF', '1960s', 'input', 'DVDs', 'very', 'exciting', 'set', 'Professor', 'Eddie', 'Lusk', 'Blues', 'Review', 'backup', 'group', 'honestly-they', 'are', 'only', 'adequate', 'Otis', 'horn', 'section', 'tighter', 'drummer', 'bassist', 'bring', 'out', 'sound', 'great', 'over', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'performance', 'guitar', 'little', 'thin', 'down', 'mix', 'However', 'learn', 'few', 'great', 'things', 'technique', 'lot', 'pick', 'also', 'when', 'pick', 'different', 'sides', 'angles-pretty', 'cool', 'most', 'revealing', 'item', 'great', 'vibrato', 'done', 'not', 'only', 'ring', 'finger-but', 'also', 'forefinger', ""'m"", 'sure', 'where', 'Mike', 'Bloomfield', 'picked', 'up-one', 'Mike', 'most', 'distinctive', 'licks', 'set', 'very', 'good', 'comprehensive', '1986', 'Many', 'tunes', 'are', 'Right', 'Place', 'Wrong', 'Time', 'LP', 'LP', 'took', 'ten', 'years', 'be', 'released', 'Tops', 'album', 'recorded', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Blues', 'Festival', 'probably', 'best', 'live', 'CD', 'Then', 'Earl', 'Hooker', 'signature', 'tune', 'Wonder', 'Why', 'Blues', 'D', 'Natural', 'bit', 'slow', 'underplayed', 'bass', 'drummer', 'then', 'Little', 'Milton', 'Lonely', 'Man', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'was', 'also', 'Albert', 'King', 'tune', 'Otis', 'further', 'Albert', 'Crosscut', 'Saw', 'Let', 'Have', 'Natural', 'Ball', 'very', 'nice', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Love', 'Me', '-done', 'Albert', 'King', 'funkiest', 'instrumental', 'Peter', 'Green', 'did', 'Bluesbreakers', 'Al', 'Kooper', 'did', 'Super', 'Session', '-and', 'later', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'did', 'Montreux', '1990', 'Otis', 'tune', 'excellent', 'laid', 'back', 'Willie', 'Cobb', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proud.The', 'tune', 'Gambler', 'Blues', 'Otis', 'excellence', 'slow', 'blues', 'tune', 'medley', 'My', 'Own', 'Fault', 'are', 'B.B', 'King', 'tunes', 'as', 'well', 'major', 'Rush', 'influence', 'T-Bone', 'Walker', 'Mean', 'Old', 'World', 'offered', 'tune', 'did', 'lot', '1970s', '-it', 'bit', 'uptempo', 'cool', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'out', 'plays', 'very', 'well', 'Fender', 'Custom', 'Shop', 'Strat', 'red', 'match', 'Otis', 'ES-355', 'Gibson', 'Much', 'better', 'most', 'latest', 'efforts', 'out', 'several', 'Otis', 'tunes', 'curiously', 'vocal', 'Double', 'Trouble', 'coming', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'concert', 'person', 'playing', 'riff', 'Satisfaction', 'instead', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'strange', 'Otis', 'also', 'mike', 'problems', 'as', 'well', 'Eric', 'guitar', 'bit', 'too', 'thick', 'phrasing', 'really', 'excellent.The', 'Rush', 'signature', 'tune', 'Love', 'really', 'great-look', 'facial', 'expression', 'Lusk', 'Band', 'guitar', 'player', 'Tony', 'Palmer', 'who', 'interestingly', 'featured', 'new', 'Jimmy', 'Burns', 'DVD', '20', 'years', 'later', 'watching', 'Eric', 'solo', 'classic', 'Luther', 'Allison', 'out', 'one', 'number', 'really', 'song', 'tribute', 'Otis', 'not', 'really', 'Everyday', 'Have', 'Blues', 'Luther', 'bit', 'think', 'guitar', 'way', 'too', 'distorted', 'was', 'Hendrix', 'disciple', 'footage', 'West', 'Side', 'Bluesmen', 'scarse', 'Freddie', 'King', 'had', 'several', 'releases', 'Beat', 'probably', 'best-shows', 'pre-1970s', 'period', 'Buddy', 'Guy', 'had', 'lot', 'later', 'material', 'Lightning', 'A', 'Bottle', 'hardly', 'anything', 'early', 'days', 'best', 'DVD', 'release', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'Junior', 'Wells', 'Montreux', 'Messin', 'Blues', 'early', '1970s', 'Magic', 'Sam', 'only', 'only', 'one', 'recorded', 'performance', '2nd', 'AFBF', 'DVD', 'Otis', 'two', 'mentioned', 'review', 'tune', 'done', 'Scorsese', 'Blues', 'Film', 'Father', 'Sons', 'extra', '.If', 'love', 'Blues', 'music', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'A', 'great', 'record', 'Otis', 'Rush', 'career', ""'ll"", 'see', 'younger', 'other', 'performance', 'AFBF', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Quit', 'Baby', '1960s']",N/A

Otis sings and plays well in this show, and the band lays down some solid playing behind him too. Professor Eddie Lusk, the band leader and keyboardist, gives Rush a strong introduction. The drummer here is a little too busy on most of the songs, but Lusk is fun to watch as he really gets into the music during the show.Otis proves himself a fine blues vocalist as he sings his heart out during an excellent performance of ""Gambler's Blues"" that is one of the high points of the concert. Otis and the band carry the show just fine by themselves, but the special appearance of Eric Clapton is a nice treat. The audience gives him a rousing welcome as he takes the stage. Clapton offers some nice solos during his segment and sings really well on a duet of Otis' masterpiece ""Double Trouble"". Both Clapton and Rush recorded excellent versions of this classic song.Otis is a good guitar player and a soulful singer, but here he lacks the powerful stage presence of other bluesmen such as Buddy Guy or Freddie King, and Clapton is pretty mellow on this night as well. The energetic Luther Allison comes out for one song and raises the energy level a few notches with a spirited performance. He gets up in Clapton's face and plays a gritty solo that leaves Eric smiling.
