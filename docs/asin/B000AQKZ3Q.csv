Chapdelaine ""film collector""","[7, 20]","(...). don't get me wrong i really liked the ring and the grudge but this is horrible. there is 10 ""scary"" stories on this dvd and not a single one is frightening. they're all cheesy as hell and most aren't even really about scaring anyone. example; one of the first ones is supposed to be about a female swimmer who encounters one of these ""spirits"". thinking it's her friends trying to scare her ,when she's in the locker room, she confronts the ghost of a dead girl that died in the school. the ghost is in a bathroom stall and ends up trying to pull her over the top of the stall door. the girl breaks free and runs to the exit trying to escape as the ghost is hot on her trail. sounds pretty scary right. wrong, you never see the ghost, except for a painted white hand, and nothing happens to the girl, besides a little mark on her wrist. this dvd is terrible and if you like to be frightened beyond all belief i'd say look somewhere else.",1,don't spend time or money !,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,944,"['do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'i', 'really', 'liked', 'ring', 'grudge', 'horrible', '10', 'scary', 'stories', 'dvd', 'not', 'single', 'one', 'frightening', ""'re"", 'cheesy', 'hell', 'most', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'scaring', 'anyone', 'example', 'one', 'first', 'ones', 'supposed', 'be', 'female', 'swimmer', 'who', 'one', 'spirits', 'thinking', 'trying', 'scare', 'when', 'locker', 'room', 'ghost', 'dead', 'girl', 'died', 'school', 'ghost', 'bathroom', 'stall', 'up', 'trying', 'pull', 'top', 'stall', 'door', 'girl', 'breaks', 'free', 'exit', 'trying', 'escape', 'ghost', 'hot', 'trail', 'pretty', 'scary', 'right', 'wrong', 'never', 'see', 'ghost', 'painted', 'white', 'hand', 'nothing', 'happens', 'girl', 'little', 'mark', 'wrist', 'dvd', 'terrible', 'like', 'be', 'frightened', 'belief', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', 'look', 'somewhere', 'else']",N/A

Some of the stories are not really scary, but some of them actually do cause a little bit of an adrenaline rush. It really isn't that bad. I enjoyed watching this with a friend, even though some times we made fun of some stories, and other times we expressed our anger for neglected people. (Sort-of-Spoiler: One of the ghost stories is about a girl who died in a changing room at a community pool and no one realized she was gone.)",4,Surprisingly not bad.,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,472,"['was', 'actually', 'bit', 'impressed', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'scary', 'actually', 'do', 'cause', 'little', 'bit', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'friend', 'even', 'times', 'made', 'fun', 'stories', 'other', 'times', 'expressed', 'anger', 'neglected', 'people', 'Sort-of-Spoiler', 'One', 'ghost', 'stories', 'girl', 'who', 'died', 'changing', 'room', 'community', 'pool', 'one', 'realized', 'was', 'gone']",N/A

Mentioning or comparing those two movies with this production is false advertising.  These stories are allegedly true, but fall flat with cheesy special effects (the light emanating from a ghost is just a spotlight chasing people around) and tame plotlines.  Not to mention every story is told by a girl, usually junior high age.  Males exist only in supporting roles in two tales.The stories are more relaxing than anything else.  The slight spookiness here is best served as an appetizer for a truly terrifying film.",3,"Tame, But Enjoyable",1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,597,"['are', 'looking', 'be', 'scared', 'wits', 'not', 'going', 'do', 'Mentioning', 'comparing', 'two', 'movies', 'production', 'false', 'advertising', 'stories', 'are', 'allegedly', 'true', 'fall', 'flat', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'light', 'emanating', 'ghost', 'just', 'spotlight', 'chasing', 'people', 'tame', 'plotlines', 'Not', 'mention', 'story', 'told', 'girl', 'usually', 'junior', 'high', 'age', 'Males', 'exist', 'only', 'supporting', 'roles', 'two', 'tales.The', 'stories', 'are', 'more', 'relaxing', 'anything', 'else', 'slight', 'spookiness', 'here', 'best', 'served', 'appetizer', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'film']",N/A

Ive been studying Japanese for 1.5 years now and loved this video because the dialogue is clear and slow enough to understand. Even if you're not studying Japanese I recommend this.
