Maggie Smith plays the spinster Judith Hearne, a lonely Dublin woman who's spent her life caring for her sick aunt, seeking refuge in the teachings of the Catholic Church, and when that fails, the bottle. She meets an American Babbitt type (played by Bob Hoskins) who shows her some attention, especially after he learns she's got money. She immediately fancies he's in love with her and she throws herself at him, only to be rebuked. This pushes her off the deep end: she renounces her faith, hits the bottle hard, and ends up in an institution.Years go by after which Hoskins shows up again and asks Smith to marry him; she realizes it's just for her money now and sends him packing. Her lonely life will remain just that.Smith is superb as Hearne; in fact, everyone is outstanding. The boarding house in which much of the action takes place is occupied by some of the meanest people you're likely to find. Although most of the action takes place in the present, Hearne's life is revealed to us through an excellent use of flashbacks - just enough to fill us in on her past without detracting from the story. It's a terrific production; I wonder if the loneliness of an aging woman has ever been better captured in a movie. It's poignant and sad - and a magnificent film. Definitely worth a watch. And should be on DVD!!",5,Maggie Smith is brilliant as Judith Hearne,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,1380,"['What', 'great', 'movie', 'why', 'not', 'DVD', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'spinster', 'Judith', 'Hearne', 'lonely', 'Dublin', 'woman', 'who', 'spent', 'life', 'caring', 'sick', 'aunt', 'seeking', 'refuge', 'teachings', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'when', 'bottle', 'American', 'Babbitt', 'type', 'played', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'who', 'attention', 'especially', 'got', 'money', 'immediately', 'love', 'only', 'be', 'rebuked', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'faith', 'bottle', 'hard', 'up', 'institution.Years', 'go', 'up', 'again', 'Smith', 'marry', 'just', 'money', 'now', 'packing', 'lonely', 'life', 'will', 'remain', 'just', 'that.Smith', 'superb', 'Hearne', 'fact', 'everyone', 'outstanding', 'boarding', 'house', 'much', 'action', 'place', 'occupied', 'meanest', 'people', ""'re"", 'likely', 'find', 'most', 'action', 'place', 'present', 'Hearne', 'life', 'revealed', 'excellent', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'just', 'enough', 'fill', 'past', 'detracting', 'story', 'terrific', 'production', 'wonder', 'loneliness', 'aging', 'woman', 'ever', 'been', 'better', 'captured', 'movie', 'poignant', 'sad', 'magnificent', 'film', 'Definitely', 'watch', 'should', 'be', 'DVD']",The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne VHS

430539,A2X25C107CSLOR,6304653417,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[14, 15]","Maggie Smith hasn't played the lead for such a long time that part of the joy of this 1987 British film directed by Jack Clayton is seeing her again. Based on the wonderful novel by Irish Brian Moore published in 1955, this  project was optioned at various times by Geraldine Page, Katharine Hepburn,  Rachel Roberts and Deborah Kerr but circumstances failed them. Perhaps we  were lucky to have waited for Smith since she is heartbreakingly good as  the aging spinster who has her last chance at romance when she moves into a  Dublin boardinghouse. Smith's large sorrowful dark blue eyes express the  waste of her life and her yearning for happiness yet she is never pathetic,  even when we see her lying about her relationship with American Bob  Hoskins. Their romance is a based on a misunderstanding that you wait to  unravel. I particularly like the scene after Smith has learnt the truth  when she gets progressively drunker and funnier as she talks to a family  who barely tolerate her visits. Hoskins acts with his eyebrows, like a  hyper-Groucho, though strangely his weakness adds a dimension to the  ending. Worth noting are Marie Kean as the landlady, whose smiles conceal  malice; Ian McNeice as her son, a piggy Dylan Thomas; and the lovely music  of Georges Delerue.",5,heartbreaking Maggie Smith,962496000,"07 2, 2000",2000,1281,"['Maggie', 'Smith', ""n't"", 'played', 'lead', 'such', 'long', 'time', 'part', 'joy', '1987', 'British', 'film', 'directed', 'Jack', 'Clayton', 'seeing', 'again', 'Based', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'Irish', 'Brian', 'Moore', 'published', '1955', 'project', 'was', 'optioned', 'various', 'times', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Rachel', 'Roberts', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'circumstances', 'failed', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'lucky', 'have', 'waited', 'Smith', 'heartbreakingly', 'good', 'aging', 'spinster', 'who', 'last', 'chance', 'romance', 'when', 'Dublin', 'boardinghouse', 'Smith', 'large', 'sorrowful', 'dark', 'blue', 'eyes', 'express', 'waste', 'life', 'yearning', 'happiness', 'yet', 'never', 'pathetic', 'even', 'when', 'see', 'lying', 'relationship', 'American', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'romance', 'based', 'misunderstanding', 'wait', 'unravel', 'particularly', 'scene', 'Smith', 'learnt', 'truth', 'when', 'progressively', 'drunker', 'funnier', 'family', 'who', 'barely', 'tolerate', 'visits', 'acts', 'eyebrows', 'hyper-Groucho', 'strangely', 'weakness', 'dimension', 'ending', 'noting', 'are', 'Marie', 'Kean', 'landlady', 'smiles', 'conceal', 'malice', 'Ian', 'McNeice', 'son', 'piggy', 'Dylan', 'Thomas', 'lovely', 'music', 'Georges', 'Delerue']",The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne VHS
430540,AXHCIHVT92GYF,6304653417,The CinemaScope Cat,"[0, 0]","Set in 1950 Dublin, an aging spinster (Maggie Smith) with a secret drinking problem arrives at a shabby boarding house hoping for a new start. When she meets the landlady's (Marie Kean, BARRY LYNDON) unrefined brother (Bob Hoskins), she fancies he's attracted to her and thinks that she has finally met the man she's been waiting for all her life. But fate has other things in store for her. If asked, most people would probably say THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE is Smith's best performance. It's not. It's THE LONELY PASSION OF MISS JUDITH HEARNE. All the actress-y mannerisms that her fans love are absent here. Smith's performance is open and raw and ultimately heartbreaking, a devastating portrait of a desperate woman at the end of her tether, a woman whose illusions and beliefs have been torn from her and who now sees the abyss. Jack Clayton is a director who understands women and several actresses have done some of their very best work under his direction (Simone Signoret, Anne Bancroft, Deborah Kerr) and under his guidance, Smith gives a blistering performance. The subtle score is by Georges Delerue. George Harrison and Elton John are among the producers.
