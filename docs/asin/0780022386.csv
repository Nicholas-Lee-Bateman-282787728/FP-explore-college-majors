26803,A1LMBOI3T91P87,0780022386,Allan M. Lees,"[1, 2]","It's difficult not to be nostalgic now about The Unbearable Lightness of Being. This was a world in which the Soviet Union was a fact of life for hundreds of millions of people and a particular kind of culture and way of life existed. In a strange way it's initially an optimistic kind of world, and that's appropriate for what is essentially an optimistic view of human nature and love. Other reviewers have covered the jist of the tale so I won't recount it here. Suffice it to say that the young Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent as the sexually magnetic Tomas; equally important is the fact that the cinamatography is outstanding.The movie pivots around departures: first the departure of Tomas and his circle for Geneva after the Prague Spring is crushed by Russian soliders; then the departure from Geneva back to Prague that is precipitated by Teresa's loss of hope regarding her marriage. The sub-plot departure of Sabina presages the main plot departure of Teresa and both are synchronous. It's a truism that women leave, almost heedless of the wreck they cause by their departures, and the story is true to life in this regard. When Tomas follows Teresa back to Prague the movie grows dark and claustrophobic - the CCCP has imposed its iron rule and the color has gone out of the world. Little details like the removal of passports, Tomas' colleagues with their too-ready acceptance of compromises and betrayals... these small notes add layer upon layer of atmosphere, just as the small light notes of the beginning of the movie lent warmth and optimism.For someone viewing this in 2011 - especially if you've been to former Soviet Union countries - it's like stepping back in time to a world lost long ago. It wasn't a good world, but in this vignette it's intense and poignant and makes for an irresistible movie. It's heart-rending and worth every moment. Usually adaptations of books are inferior but in this case I venture the opinion that the movie is a better artistic creation than the book from which it is taken.",5,A Glimpse into a World Long Past,1300147200,"03 15, 2011",2011,2028,"['difficult', 'not', 'be', 'nostalgic', 'now', 'Unbearable', 'Lightness', 'Being', 'was', 'world', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'fact', 'life', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'people', 'particular', 'kind', 'culture', 'way', 'life', 'existed', 'strange', 'way', 'initially', 'optimistic', 'kind', 'world', 'appropriate', 'what', 'essentially', 'optimistic', 'view', 'human', 'nature', 'love', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'covered', 'jist', 'tale', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recount', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'young', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'excellent', 'sexually', 'magnetic', 'Tomas', 'equally', 'important', 'fact', 'cinamatography', 'outstanding.The', 'movie', 'pivots', 'departures', 'first', 'departure', 'Tomas', 'circle', 'Geneva', 'Prague', 'Spring', 'crushed', 'Russian', 'soliders', 'then', 'departure', 'Geneva', 'back', 'Prague', 'precipitated', 'Teresa', 'loss', 'hope', 'regarding', 'marriage', 'sub-plot', 'departure', 'Sabina', 'main', 'plot', 'departure', 'Teresa', 'are', 'synchronous', 'truism', 'women', 'leave', 'almost', 'heedless', 'wreck', 'cause', 'departures', 'story', 'true', 'life', 'regard', 'When', 'Tomas', 'Teresa', 'back', 'Prague', 'movie', 'dark', 'claustrophobic', 'CCCP', 'imposed', 'iron', 'rule', 'color', 'gone', 'world', 'Little', 'details', 'removal', 'passports', 'Tomas', 'colleagues', 'too-ready', 'acceptance', 'compromises', 'betrayals', 'small', 'notes', 'add', 'layer', 'layer', 'atmosphere', 'just', 'small', 'light', 'notes', 'beginning', 'movie', 'lent', 'warmth', 'optimism.For', 'someone', 'viewing', '2011', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'been', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'countries', 'stepping', 'back', 'time', 'world', 'lost', 'long', 'ago', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'world', 'vignette', 'intense', 'poignant', 'irresistible', 'movie', 'heart-rending', 'worth', 'moment', 'Usually', 'adaptations', 'books', 'are', 'inferior', 'case', 'venture', 'opinion', 'movie', 'better', 'artistic', 'creation', 'book', 'taken']",The Unbearable Lightness of Being
26804,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780022386,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","This two part story about love, life and politics comes together with such rich honesty that I couldn't tear my eyes away from the film, and it runs nearly three hours.  Using Czechoslovakia during the 1960's as the springboard for intensely intricate character development, `The Unbearable Lightness of Being' pulls from a deeper, darker place to deliver an exceptional film that has rightfully grown in esteem over the years.Tomas is a young doctor with a taste for flesh who gallivants through the country visiting bed after bed until he falls in love with a less liberal young woman who requires he stay monogamous.  This woman, Tereza, is beautiful and soft and yet not as interesting or as fiery as Tomas's sidepiece Sabina.  When the two women meet, sparks fly and the relationship blossoms into something truly outstanding.  In the wake of this, Tomas's pursuit of his own personal satisfaction becomes burdened by the political upheaval surrounding him, the nation in turmoil and the pursuit of liberty becoming a more impressing force.  The film exposes the moral consequences of the actions taken by these young `dreamers', crushing them with consequence and judgment and yet never conforming to stereotypical tones.There is a lightness that permeates and helps underscore the more dramatic elements to the film.From a technical standpoint, this film is ravishing.  The cinematography, set pieces, costumes and gripping direction are truly a sight to behold.  Kaufmann liberates the 172 minute running time with an electricity and balanced delicacy that helps carve out a unique and thought provoking character study that is simply unforgettable.  Daniel Day-Lewis and Lena Olin are remarkable here, especially Olin who just unearths such sexual and emotional honesty.  Derek de Lint makes a lot of his screen time, and while Juliette Binoche isn't quite at the top of her game (she became one of the finest actresses of her generation), she quietly anchors the film with a character who observes and takes in and becomes a beacon of morale for the film.",5,"Don't let the lightness fool you, this film packs a major punch...",1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,2065,"['two', 'part', 'story', 'love', 'life', 'politics', 'together', 'such', 'rich', 'honesty', 'could', ""n't"", 'tear', 'eyes', 'away', 'film', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'Using', 'Czechoslovakia', '1960', 'springboard', 'intensely', 'intricate', 'character', 'development', 'Unbearable', 'Lightness', 'Being', 'pulls', 'deeper', 'darker', 'place', 'deliver', 'exceptional', 'film', 'rightfully', 'grown', 'esteem', 'years.Tomas', 'young', 'doctor', 'taste', 'flesh', 'who', 'country', 'visiting', 'bed', 'bed', 'love', 'less', 'liberal', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'monogamous', 'woman', 'Tereza', 'beautiful', 'soft', 'yet', 'not', 'interesting', 'as', 'fiery', 'Tomas', 'sidepiece', 'Sabina', 'When', 'two', 'women', 'meet', 'sparks', 'fly', 'relationship', 'blossoms', 'something', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'wake', 'Tomas', 'pursuit', 'own', 'personal', 'satisfaction', 'becomes', 'burdened', 'political', 'upheaval', 'surrounding', 'nation', 'turmoil', 'pursuit', 'liberty', 'becoming', 'more', 'impressing', 'force', 'film', 'moral', 'consequences', 'actions', 'taken', 'young', 'dreamers', 'crushing', 'consequence', 'judgment', 'yet', 'never', 'conforming', 'stereotypical', 'lightness', 'underscore', 'more', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'film.From', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'film', 'ravishing', 'cinematography', 'set', 'pieces', 'costumes', 'gripping', 'direction', 'are', 'truly', 'sight', 'behold', 'Kaufmann', '172', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'electricity', 'balanced', 'delicacy', 'carve', 'out', 'unique', 'thought', 'provoking', 'character', 'study', 'simply', 'unforgettable', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'are', 'remarkable', 'here', 'especially', 'Olin', 'who', 'just', 'unearths', 'such', 'sexual', 'emotional', 'honesty', 'Derek', 'Lint', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', ""n't"", 'quite', 'top', 'game', 'became', 'one', 'finest', 'actresses', 'generation', 'quietly', 'film', 'character', 'who', 'beacon', 'morale', 'film']",The Unbearable Lightness of Being

And Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin are very pleasant to look at...not so the rest of the film, however.  Its title is  pretentious and essentially empty, and thus an excellent match for the  movie, but if I were to name it a little more honestly, a better variation  on the theme would be &quot;The Unbearable Self-Importance of  Being...Philip Kaufman&quot;.  Nothing seemingly happens or is displayed  for much rhyme or reason, but then how could it...that would defeat the  purpose.  The characters are hateful and frankly rather ridiculous  (unintentionally, to be sure).  When I'm in the mood for a caricature of a  womanizer, I'll fire up a Happy Days episode or two and watch the Fonz go  at it in style, thanks.  And as much as I like Lena Olin and Daniel  Day-Lewis (though I certainly wouldn't, if I were judging them on the basis  of this movie alone), their performances are extremely over-rated and  surprisingly sub-par, and the horribly mangled accents are distracting.  Juliette Binoche is the only one, in my opinion, deserving of praise for  her performance (her accent also notwithstanding, mind you).  If you like  the female human body, you'll enjoy this film for its visceral qualities in  that respect...they are certainly very nice.  As for the film itself, if  you like low-IQ artsy stylism like cactii as phallic symbols, incohesive  dialog, and morally bankrupt parodies of characters that make decisions and  live their life as if it really were a film (ie. a couple of hours long and  with an audience), then you may well enjoy it as much as the ranks of  lemmings who extoll this pretentious waste of celluloid's virtues and do  the majority of intelligence-burdened film buyers a disservice.  As for the  DVD itself, it comes with no extras, the picture quality is poor and the  sound is only available in Dolby 2.0, not 5.1., so it comes up short  technically as well.

Because of the latter he is no longer allowed to practice medicine and is forced to live on a farm in poverty. His love for the woman, too, has been put to the test, yet he sticks with her, even though it means returning to his country after being given exile in France.The themes are intelligent and interesting, but the development is too slow: the movie is much too long at nearly 3 hours. Scenes seemed to be dragged out interminably, especially those in Paris as he weighs his conscience regarding his love and his homeland, and near the end on the farm.

There are many reviews that detail, in an equisite fashion, the story, the actors and information about the movie.

Teresa was the Madonna, the only man she ever slept with was Tomas.  Then there was Sabina - she was Tomas' lover before and after his marriage to Teresa. But Sabina and Tomas were alike, irrespective of their gender differences.There is one scene which took place when Tomas, Teresa and Sabina became ex-patriates in Switzerland.  Teresa came to Sabina's studio/home.  Teresa became sensitized to the fact that Tomas had been with Sabina - while Teresa is taking pictures of Sabina, tears roll down Teresa's face.  Sabina takes the camera and starts taking pictures of Teresa.  She makes Teresa take off her clothes.  Eventually they end up on the floor - if Sabina's Swiss lover had not come in, I think that Sabina would have made love to Teresa in a soft, gentle way.  But the innocent Teresa jumped up, naked, to run away as she became aware of her nakedness.I like movies about human nature and interactions.

Fans will rave about this release, detractors will still say it does no justice to a superior novel, and most, like me, will fall somewhere in between. What did amaze me was how much better this movie looked on DVD than on the old VHS full-screen copy I have. In widescreen there's much more to see, and the scenery is a big part of this film, particularly during the tense moments between Tereza and the Soviet soldiers when life and death hung in the balance over possession of a camera.As for the actual movie:For those who don't know, this is the motion picture version of Czech writer Milan Kundera's novel about a libertine doctor, his wife, mistress, and their lives in Prague before, during, and after the Soviet crackdown of 1968. This is film that has its fair share of sex and nudity but it is one that never quite becomes as erotic as it is supposed to be or wishes it was. The Unbearable Lightness of Being is noteworthy because of fine performances by Daniel Day Lewis, Lena Olin, and Juliette Binoche, but to me and others who came of age after the Cold War, it seems a period piece rather than the revelation it probably was a generation back.

26813,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0780022386,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[2, 4]","This movie adaptation of Miles Kundera's book, which I haven't read yet, is a lengthy and illuminating study on freedom versus captivity, strength versus weakness as seen in the interractions between a handsome womanizing surgeon, Tomas, his lover and the woman who understands him most, the artist Sabena, and a Tereza, bright young waitress Tomas meets after performing an operation at a spa-town.  Tereza shows up in Prague and unlike his character, they get married, complete with a piglet wearing a necktie whose squeals cause them to giggle uncontrollably at the ceremonyThe movie is set during the Prague Spring, that brief shining moment when a liberal communism under Alexander Dubcek's socialism with a human face, seems possible.  To which Tomas mentions the ill-fated uprising in Hungary (1956).  Tomas himself contrasts King Oedipus to the Soviet leaders.  Oedipus couldn't bear the sight of what he had done to bring about the plagues in Thebes, so he plucked his own eyes out and left.  The Soviet leaders though, were unlike Oedipus.  Their defense at Stalin's crimes after his death was ""We didn't know.""  Morality also changed since Oedipus.  Tomas then says that the Soviet hardliners stayed in power when they should have plucked their eyes out.  He writes an article to that effect, something that will cost him dearly later.At one point, the table and glasses rumble as Tomas and Tereza are arguing.  An earthquake?  Tomas follows Tereza outside.  The source of the tremor is then seen.  Pushing its way aggressively down the alley towards them is the menacing shadow of a Soviet tank.  Yes, it's 20 August 1968.A great highlight is when the picture turns to b&w; portion during the demonstration in Wencesclas Square, soldiers atop tanks, people climbing on top of them, chants of ""Dubcek"" and ""svoboda"", the fire of machine guns and people fleeing, bodies covered with Czech flags, with Tomas and Tereza in the thick of the action, marching, fleeing, or in Tereza's case, snapping pictures like mad.  The scene ends dramatically with a Soviet soldier warning her, pointing his pistol at her through the lens.Sabena, and later Tomas and Tereza flee for Geneva, but things don't work out.  All three journey again, the latter two back to Czechoslovakia, where under the reinforced hardliners under the thumb of Leonid Brezhnev and Gustav Husak, their part in the uprising becomes a liability.Sabena is compatible with Tomas's sex opposed to love.  She asks him, ""Are you only searching for pleasure or is every a woman a new hat whose secrets you want to discover?""  She is sexually independent, strong-minded, and the mistress of her destiny.  This is demonstrated when she meets Franz, a married lawyer, in Geneva.  At a cafe, she comments on how music becomes noise, that even the plastic flowers are in a filled vase, and points to the building behind her as the ""uglification of the world.  The only place we can find beauty is where its persecutors have overlooked it.  It's a planetary process, and I can't stand it.""  She becomes Franz's lover, but when he leaves his wife to be with her, she fears for her freedom, realizes she has left one cage behind only to become prey to a different one.  But ultimately, freedom leads to another cage, that of loneliness, and the lack of happiness.Tereza wants a monogamous relationship with Tomas, but finds esteem in doing something fulfilling, being a faithful wife who does her part.  She can't adapt to Geneva so returns.  In doing so, though, it's back to political captivity, back to a totalitarian regime, but at a lower status.  If freedom/loneliness doesn't yield happiness, does that mean captivity and community yields it?Yes, there is quite a bit of sex and nudity here, but nothing gratuitous or pornographic.  It's more a tasteful erotica, i.e. the much ballyhooed scenes of Sabena and Tereza photographing each other.  Sabena comes off as haunted, serene, grave, at times a twinkle of mischief in the photos.Lena Olin gives the strongest performance here, exuding a strong, enigmatic, sensuous aura as the sexually independent Sabena.  She would've been a strong candidate as an Oscar nominee.  Praiase also to Juliette Binoche's sweet, shy, sensitive, loving Tereza, the role that boosted her to the spotlight.  Daniel Day-Lewis's Tomas becomes more developed and human in the film's second half.

26814,A1P0FB2NTOHGVF,0780022386,Dave Bridge,"[0, 0]","It's hard to rate this film because it has so many different levels on which such a rating might be based, both dark and light. To begin with, there's a lot of graphic sex (how do actors do these scenes as mere 'simulations'?) and even more nudity. If that's to your taste, you'll love this film. On another level, it's a pretty searing portrait of the ruthless Soviet crushing of the so-called Prague Spring and the subsequent imposition on the Czechs of their always oppressive totalitarian regime. At times, it can be quite comedic, at others painfully tragic and sad - especially at the end. There are also elements that defy credence, specifically that the character of Tomasz (Day-Lewis) appears to possess the mesmeric power of inducing women to remove all their clothes by simply saying, &#34;Take off your clothes&#34; (tip to guys: try this line at your peril). I confess to not having read Kundera's book, on which this film is putatively based, so I don't know how faithful to that novel it might be. The principle actors - Day-Lewis, Juliet Binoche, Lena Olin - are all superb in these difficult roles and Day-Lewis makes it difficult not to envy his character's easy sexual success, but this is a very complex and emotionally challenging story, not just a sexual romp. In fact, even the sex - which tends to dominate the film - is often compromised by painful emptiness and futility, much like real as opposed to movie life. This is not a happy story and these are definitely not happy people. The fact that the two main characters choose to return from a life of freedom in the West to the dismal, soul-crushing tyranny of life in Soviet subjugated Czechoslovakia is presumably the basis for the title; that they ultimately find the lightness of being free unbearable and are thus compelled to return to slavery - the classic Stockholm syndrome - and there they ultimately die.",4,The unbearable lightness of the Unbearable Lightness of Being,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1892,"['hard', 'rate', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'rating', 'might', 'be', 'based', 'dark', 'light', 'begin', 'lot', 'graphic', 'sex', 'how', 'do', 'actors', 'do', 'scenes', 'mere', ""'simulations"", 'even', 'more', 'nudity', 'taste', ""'ll"", 'love', 'film', 'level', 'pretty', 'searing', 'portrait', 'ruthless', 'Soviet', 'crushing', 'so-called', 'Prague', 'Spring', 'subsequent', 'imposition', 'Czechs', 'always', 'oppressive', 'totalitarian', 'regime', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'comedic', 'others', 'painfully', 'tragic', 'sad', 'especially', 'end', 'are', 'also', 'elements', 'defy', 'credence', 'specifically', 'character', 'Tomasz', 'Day-Lewis', 'possess', 'mesmeric', 'power', 'inducing', 'women', 'remove', 'clothes', 'simply', 'saying', '34', 'Take', 'off', 'clothes', '34', 'tip', 'guys', 'try', 'line', 'peril', 'confess', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'Kundera', 'book', 'film', 'putatively', 'based', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'faithful', 'novel', 'might', 'be', 'principle', 'actors', 'Day-Lewis', 'Juliet', 'Binoche', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'are', 'superb', 'difficult', 'roles', 'Day-Lewis', 'difficult', 'not', 'envy', 'character', 'easy', 'sexual', 'success', 'very', 'complex', 'emotionally', 'challenging', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'sexual', 'romp', 'fact', 'even', 'sex', 'dominate', 'film', 'often', 'compromised', 'painful', 'emptiness', 'futility', 'much', 'like', 'real', 'opposed', 'movie', 'life', 'not', 'happy', 'story', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'happy', 'people', 'fact', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'choose', 'return', 'life', 'freedom', 'West', 'dismal', 'soul-crushing', 'tyranny', 'life', 'Soviet', 'subjugated', 'Czechoslovakia', 'presumably', 'basis', 'title', 'ultimately', 'find', 'lightness', 'being', 'free', 'unbearable', 'are', 'thus', 'compelled', 'return', 'slavery', 'classic', 'Stockholm', 'syndrome', 'ultimately', 'die']",The Unbearable Lightness of Being

That it's an existentialist discourse on being and happiness?  Yes it is all those  things, and others have said plenty along those lines.  But it really makes  the film sound a lot more boring than it actually is, for this is one of  those rare films where you actually become interested in, and sometimes are  even moved by, the fate of the characters.At 170 minutes the film is  long, but never tedious.  Those of you who really hate long films can watch  this in 2 sittings - the sequence dealing with the Soviet invasion of  Prague is the natural divider.  (BTW I was quite impressed by how  seamlessly the main characters were weaved into actual documentary  footages.)  The story is intense, but not ponderous.  The plot unfolds at a  leisurely pace allowing the viewer to soak in the stunning imageries, while  the story was engrossing enough to make you forget the passage of time.  The acting, btw, was superb.  Juliet Binoche really shines in this one  though I didn't find her  other roles that memorable.  Daniel Day-Lewis  allegedly suffered a nervous breakdown after making this film, although you  can't tell from his stolidly understated performance.This is a deep  film, and not just because somebody compared Brezhnev to Oedipus Rex.  Charges of &quot;shallowness&quot; really say more about the viewer than  the film.  It does not wear its depth on its sleeves and does not pound its  &quot;message&quot; into you with a 2X4.  But it lingers in the back of  your mind and makes you think twice at the odd moment.Finally, labels  such as &quot;pseudo-intellectual&quot; shouldn't be chugged around like a  grenade.

Each has his or her own interpretation. I didn't like Kundera's book, I found it silly, disjointed, and boastful. Perhaps I could find some meaning in it if I set my mind to the task. I'm pretty good at assigning meaning when there is none. Perhaps the book suffered in translation.  Perhaps one had to experience the coffee houses of Prague during the spring to understand.Philip Kaufman's film THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING is wonderful and awfully sad. The film is wonderful because of the three main actors: Daniel Day Lewis, Lena Olin, and Juliette Binoche. In THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING DDL plays Tomas a doctor with women on his mind--another character for his diverse vita. BEING is about beautiful young people who seem unfulfilled as human beings until it is too late. I was young and restless once--in the 1960s--and I think it's very hard to be happy when you are young. You suffer from these foolish notion that you can change the world--or you can't. You start revolutions--or you don't. Mostly, you try to figure out what the heck life is about.Tomas has frivolous things on his mind. Or does he. After all, procreation is the stuff of survival and he is just the right age to be at the mercy of his survival instincts. Does Tomas think of women too much? Is he a lothario or is he trying to find himself? I think Tomas is Tomas and you either like him or you don't. I don't think he thinks about woman more than any other man his age. If you're a woman, you get involved with Tomas or you don't. He does have a way with women. But, Tomas is not happy--he is a cynic until it is too late.Why does Tomas marry? Maybe underneath it all he wants a &quot;regular&quot; life. Or, maybe Tomas wants his cake and he wants to eat it too. Apparently, he wants a wife as he acquires one. And he wants to keep on seeing other women because he does. I am sure most of the men who saw this film and thought it was a very good film did so because they would like to be like Tomas or at least fantasize they are like Tomas. I am sure some of these very intelligent and educated men can find rationalizations for why this is a profound film.Actually, I think Philip Kaufman has his tongue in his cheek. HENRY AND JUNE (another of his films) is simply the reverse of THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING. Anais Nin wanted to have her cake and eat it too.  She wanted a husband and a full range of sexual experiences with other men (and women). Apparently she did just that. Nin's diaries are much more explict than Kundera's books and good bedtime reading. Nin started a revolution--for women.I recommend HENRY AND JUNE. Uma Thurman is wonderful as June and Kevin Spacey also stars in this very funny film, though he is not Henry Miller.

26820,A280GY5UVUS2QH,0780022386,Doug Anderson,"[22, 23]","If you've read the book you won't be disappointed with this film which doesn't try to convey all Kundera's philosophy but it does retain the spirit of the book. Really the book had what some considered to be too much philosophy in it which got in the way of the story which was not Kunderas main concern anyway as his characters were just actors he used to elucidate his ideas. For Kaufman the real heart of the book was not in its ideas but in the way Tomas and Tereza relate and how that relationship evolves within a very specific historical circumstance, the Russian occupation of Prague in 68. That moment in time is really brought to life both in the cafes as we hear a Czech. version of&quot;Hey Jude&quot; being played and in the streets when the actual invasion takes place at which point hand held black and white cameras are used to give an on the spot feel to it.When we first meet Tomas(Daniel Day Lewis) he is involved with Sabina(Lena Olin)and what they share is an almost religious belief in the erotic and an equalllly strong belief in retaining their individuality and frredom.  On a visit to a spa in the country to perform an operation however Tomas comes across the innocent waitress Tereza(Juliette Binoche) and his life after that is never quite the same. Sabina resents the intrusion at first but soon she and Tereza are friends, in fact the moment they become friends on a rainy afternoon taking pictures of each other is one of the best scenes in the movie. A lot is made of the historical happenings and how they affect each characters personal life. I found it a little hard to believe that they would willingly return to Prague under communist rule after they had made their escape to Zurich but you may feel differently. The use of the terms &quot;lightness&quot; and &quot;weight&quot; that so often appeared in the book always seemed to my ears rather vague, the movie gratefully only employs those terms on rare occasion.

26821,A382SS3RQVTZF0,0780022386,Dr Ren Codoni,"[5, 25]","After the problems with the Hrabal text in I served the King of England (see my review), Kundera suffers a similar fate. Lets start with quoting the beginning of the Wikipedia review, which sets the scene as follows:  ""The Unbearable Light-ness of Being is a 1988 American film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Milan Kundera, published in 1984. Director Philip Kaufman and screenplay writer Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re show Czechoslovak artistic and intellectual life during the Prague Spring of the Communist period, before the Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968, and detail the moral-political effects and personal consequences upon a bohemian m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois: a medical doctor and his two women.""This is definitely not the Kundera of his many books, and Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, else an excellent script writer with/for eg Bu&ntilde;uel's last six films or so, must have gotten too much under Kaufman's thumb or not have given a damn once he saw where things were going, but must certainly have been paid well. What we more generally have is a money no problem fashion product by a fashion director with international staff. The Czechoslovak atmosphere of 1968 caught by a film-crazy, unrealistically brave youngster (some would call her dumb and stupid), and while most locations would be authentic, the film has nothing Czech about it. It could have been anywhere, mostly New York, the revolt probably in Chile.I have not found any review of the film by Kundera himself, but knowing his work, I would expect that his comments were not kind. After a positive (but rather shallow and uneducated, very American) first review in the Criterion Collection by Michael Sragow (1/11/1999), twelve years down the line, Mark Lova (31/1/2011), in a very clear analysis, sums up the arguments ""It's a good question: Why care what Kundera says? I did assume that some people would care. I think if you want to do more than be a consumer of art, if you think that movies and books are not just things you use once and then throw away, you should care too. Obviously, you might like the book, and not care about the film, or you might like the film, not the book. (etc.) However, if you care about the book, you might at least wonder what Kundera was complaining about.""Where does that leave me? As I have expressed elsewhere at some stage, I do not like falsifications, and Kaufman's film to me clearly falls into that category. If you already refer to the author and title of the original book, you should show more respect - or is it simply skill (as opposed to money)?62-12 February 2012",1,An American non-European movie,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,2620,"['problems', 'Hrabal', 'text', 'served', 'King', 'England', 'see', 'review', 'Kundera', 'similar', 'fate', 'start', 'quoting', 'beginning', 'Wikipedia', 'review', 'scene', 'Unbearable', 'Light-ness', 'Being', '1988', 'American', 'film', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Milan', 'Kundera', 'published', '1984', 'Director', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'Jean-Claude', 'Carri', 'egrave', 're', 'show', 'Czechoslovak', 'artistic', 'intellectual', 'life', 'Prague', 'Spring', 'Communist', 'period', 'Soviet', 'Warsaw', 'Pact', 'invasion', 'August', '1968', 'detail', 'moral-political', 'effects', 'personal', 'consequences', 'bohemian', 'm', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'trois', 'medical', 'doctor', 'two', 'women', 'definitely', 'not', 'Kundera', 'many', 'books', 'Jean-Claude', 'Carri', 'egrave', 're', 'else', 'excellent', 'script', 'writer', 'with/for', 'eg', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'last', 'six', 'films', 'so', 'must', 'have', 'gotten', 'too', 'much', 'Kaufman', 'thumb', 'not', 'have', 'given', 'damn', 'once', 'saw', 'where', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'must', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'paid', 'well', 'What', 'more', 'generally', 'have', 'money', 'problem', 'fashion', 'product', 'fashion', 'director', 'international', 'staff', 'Czechoslovak', 'atmosphere', '1968', 'caught', 'film-crazy', 'unrealistically', 'brave', 'youngster', 'would', 'call', 'dumb', 'stupid', 'most', 'locations', 'would', 'be', 'authentic', 'film', 'nothing', 'Czech', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'anywhere', 'mostly', 'New', 'York', 'revolt', 'probably', 'Chile.I', 'have', 'not', 'found', 'review', 'film', 'Kundera', 'knowing', 'work', 'would', 'expect', 'comments', 'were', 'not', 'kind', 'positive', 'rather', 'shallow', 'uneducated', 'very', 'American', 'first', 'review', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Michael', 'Sragow', '1/11/1999', 'twelve', 'years', 'line', 'Mark', 'Lova', '31/1/2011', 'very', 'clear', 'analysis', 'sums', 'up', 'arguments', 'good', 'question', 'Why', 'care', 'what', 'Kundera', 'did', 'assume', 'people', 'would', 'care', 'think', 'want', 'do', 'more', 'be', 'consumer', 'art', 'think', 'movies', 'books', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'things', 'use', 'once', 'then', 'throw', 'away', 'should', 'care', 'too', 'Obviously', 'might', 'like', 'book', 'not', 'care', 'film', 'might', 'like', 'film', 'not', 'book', 'etc', 'However', 'care', 'book', 'might', 'least', 'wonder', 'what', 'Kundera', 'was', 'complaining', 'about', 'Where', 'leave', 'have', 'expressed', 'elsewhere', 'stage', 'do', 'not', 'falsifications', 'Kaufman', 'film', 'clearly', 'category', 'already', 'refer', 'author', 'title', 'original', 'book', 'should', 'show', 'more', 'respect', 'simply', 'skill', 'opposed', 'money', '62-12', 'February', '2012']",The Unbearable Lightness of Being

Great opening, but soon I couldn't help but wonder why these two oddball Berlin Wall era ambiguous revolutionaries are so madly in love with each other.

Instead, I wish to say that I never thought I would particularly care for this film; thought it was probably just another excuse for nudity and would be in poor taste.  This is definitely a misconception...This film is absolutely beautiful.  I was never offended in any way about anything that was depicted in it and believe every scene necessary to show the pattern of the times they portray and the characters as the individuals they were supposed to be.  I did find the sequence of the two women posing for each other a little strange.  The camera shots of the constant eye movement reminded me of the movie ""Once Upon A Time In The West"". But the use of real film footage, especially that of the Soviet invasion, is excellent and I love the extra feature offered of the film portrayed with  commentary.  You learn so much about the history and the desire  of those producing the film and what they are trying to convey as well as what they went through to be able to offer this film to us. You will notice that many of the reviews here are pretty lengthy. That is because this is truly a very thought-provoking film.  I feel silly at this point to mention it, but there are several reviews here that question (out of all that is presented here) the hair under the armpit.  I was told this was a very common practice in the European countries.  I don't know if it still is or not, but many Europeans found it very natural and quite arousing as part of their sexual foreplay.  They thought it ridiculous that we Americans felt the need to shave it.  On my first visit to Europe, I was very young, but noticed this feature about women many times and thought it ""icky"".  Then I questoned it and was informed as I mentioned above. However, I still find this unattractive but can't totally figure out why.If you think you are a little prudish and won't like this film, think again.  Please do yourself a favor and watch this fantastic, erotic film.  It is about so much more than just sex.  I love this cast.  Their talent is phenomenal.  The women are beautiful of course, but Day-Lewis exudes a sensuality that makes his character a believably charming womanizer who, nevertheless, adores his wife.  I'm so glad I bought this film.  I've watched it many times and will continue to do so.  It's hard to imagine that a young, brilliant brain surgeon should be reduced to washing windows because he would not sign statements condoning the communistic philosophy.

26834,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,0780022386,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 3]","One of the most haunting aspects of this movie is that my video store today has it under the ""Adult entertainment"" section which I thought was a joke. I first saw this on its release in 1988 at the age when I shouldn't have seen it. I'd forgotten so many details of it, and I was newly impressed at the film for the second time.That aside, I must say that despite the length (and a tendency for some parts to be longer than they should have been), this is a very good film. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Tomas so brilliantly, it's hard to think of him in his other familiar roles (Last of the Mohicans, for instance). Juliette Binoche is also great as Tereza Tomas wife. Supporting characters come and go, and the tone frequently changes with little warning. But those two things work perfectly within the context of the movie. Lena Olin, as Sabrina, does well on her role as a sculptor who also can find no place for love without freedom in her life. Her relationship with Tomas is based upon friendship and convenience. Their lovemaking is passionate but not empty or cold. If there is love, it is left unspoken.You can see how Teresa, Tomas and Sabina's actions flow from what they are on the *inside*: This film shows how Tomas is driven to his womanizing by his need to be 'light', and how Teresa finds this 'lightness' unbearable by her need for intimacy.Add on the absolutely mesmerizing cinematography (it acts as naturally as Teresa, Tomas, and Sabina do), and music that seems written for the movie yet is over 60 years old. This is truly a beautiful European film. Not in the ersatz 'Chocolat' style, but in the tradition of Krieslowski and Wajda. Within itself, it is a very moral film. It has a simple beauty that does not wear its heart on its sleeve, but within the wonderfully understated performances that also include Derek De Lindt and the great Stefan Skarsgaard.You can easily enjoy this film on both TV or on DVD/VHS. If you're not able see it on TV then don't hesitate to rent it or buy it.",4,Unbearably long yes but it proves to be a bittersweet romance.,1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,2006,"['One', 'most', 'haunting', 'aspects', 'movie', 'video', 'store', 'today', 'Adult', 'entertainment', 'section', 'thought', 'was', 'joke', 'first', 'saw', 'release', '1988', 'age', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'so', 'many', 'details', 'was', 'newly', 'impressed', 'film', 'second', 'aside', 'must', 'say', 'length', 'tendency', 'parts', 'be', 'longer', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Tomas', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'hard', 'think', 'other', 'familiar', 'roles', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'instance', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'also', 'great', 'Tereza', 'Tomas', 'wife', 'Supporting', 'characters', 'come', 'go', 'tone', 'frequently', 'little', 'warning', 'two', 'things', 'work', 'perfectly', 'context', 'movie', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Sabrina', 'well', 'role', 'sculptor', 'who', 'also', 'can', 'find', 'place', 'love', 'freedom', 'life', 'relationship', 'Tomas', 'based', 'friendship', 'convenience', 'lovemaking', 'passionate', 'not', 'empty', 'cold', 'love', 'left', 'unspoken.You', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'Teresa', 'Tomas', 'Sabina', 'actions', 'flow', 'what', 'are', '*inside*', 'film', 'how', 'Tomas', 'driven', 'womanizing', 'need', 'be', ""'light"", 'how', 'Teresa', ""'lightness"", 'unbearable', 'need', 'intimacy.Add', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'cinematography', 'as', 'naturally', 'Teresa', 'Tomas', 'Sabina', 'do', 'music', 'written', 'movie', 'yet', '60', 'years', 'old', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'European', 'film', 'Not', 'ersatz', 'style', 'tradition', 'Krieslowski', 'Wajda', 'Within', 'very', 'moral', 'film', 'simple', 'beauty', 'not', 'wear', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'performances', 'also', 'include', 'Derek', 'De', 'Lindt', 'great', 'Stefan', 'Skarsgaard.You', 'can', 'easily', 'enjoy', 'film', 'TV', 'DVD/VHS', ""'re"", 'not', 'able', 'see', 'TV', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'rent', 'buy']",The Unbearable Lightness of Being

26838,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0780022386,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[10, 10]","""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" is a film from 1988 made by director Phillip Kaufman that caught my attention at a store due to it's unusual title. The film was in the new release section due to the recent two-disc special edition and the film's title stuck in my head for a couple of weeks and I finally decided to rent it. After reading the synopsis and seeing the actors that were in it, I knew I would like it...I was unaware, however, of just how much I would like it. This movie isn't really my kind of movie. I like independent films and watch them quite a bit, but as far as plot and everything this isn't my ideal film. To give you a quick example, my favorite movie is ""Pulp Fiction"" and some movies appearing in my top 30 would be (not in this order) American Beauty, Crash, Million Dollar Baby, and Blue Velvet. But, after just a few minutes shy of three hours after I began this movie I was amazed. This movie transfixed me, I loved every single solitary second of it.Roger Ebert called this movie ""the best serious erotic film since Last Tango in Paris"" which I feel is pretty much accurate. None of the actors in this movie are Marlon Brando, but I feel this movie was better. The performances by all three main actors (Daniel Day-Lewis, Lena Olin, and Juliette Bincoche) are spectacular, but don't seem that way immediately. It's when you compare all their performances to this performance that it clicks. I'm not saying that each actor puts on their best performance in this movie, only that...Well, you've caught my drift hopefully. Another aspect I loved about this movie was it's dialouge, which is nothing short of spectacular. It's not Quentin Tarantino-quick witted, fast tongued like dialouge. It's not the kind of movie where you really even notice that the dialouge stands out, but there were lines in this film that were great. I couldn't tell you a single one right now, but there were a few times when I thought to myself ""that was a great line."" Also, I was amazed to find out (via this website) that Phillip Kaufman (director and co-adaptor of the film) is American, because this movie seems to be filmed by a foreign director. That might not make sense to some people, but it does have that kind of aura to it. The movie stars Day-Lewis as Tomas, a womanizing surgeon who lives in Prague. The man is brilliant at convincing woman to do what he wants them to do, which is detailed in a very funny opening scene. With the words ""take off your clothes"", he gets exactly what he wants. But Tomas is seemingly incapable of loving another person, but he does enjoy sex. Sex isn't a way of showing love, but is instead mere entertainment. Luckily, he has a partner that feels the same way. This partner is Sabina (Olin) a young woman, who is pretty much a female version of Tomas. One day, Tomas is sent to another town to perform an operation where a woman catches his eye. Tomas follows her and when he catches up with her, he meets Tereza (Binoche). Tereza is the polar opposite of Sabina. While Sabina is comfortable with her body, open to love-less sex, and composed.Tereza is uncomfortable with nakedness, sex, and is a bit child like in her manner. For some reason, Tomas is attracted to her and marries her while still carrying on his affair with Sabina, who has met a man named Franz who might finally be the one. Then the story takes a different turn, when the Russian invasion occurs in Prague and Tomas and Tereza end up in Switzerland, where Sabina happens to be as well. The cinematography during the scenes of the Russian invasion is very good, it first turns to black & white and then a grainy color. But, there's about as much of the synopsis I can give...Now, I'll begin my thoughts on the performances. As I said they're all great, but Olin is the best in the movie. I've seen her in several movies before and can not think of a single one and I was amazed to find out she was born in 1955, making her 51 today and 33 when this movie was made. Olin was (is) perfect for this role, as she has both the acting skills and the sexuality and body needed for the role to be believable. Day-Lewis is great, as always. It's interesting to watch My Left Foot, this film, and Gangs of New York and see how he completely embodies a character rather than just plays them. Then there's Binoche, I have several pros and really only one con  with her. She catches the child like quality, yet strong will of the character Tereza brilliantly, she should've got an Oscar nomination for this movie at least (and for all I know, she might have). But, during one of the ""sex"" scenes involving her (in the rest of them, I could barely tell) she has a fairly large abundance of armpit hair. This is just me, but that's not very attractive and when you see the other women that Tomas hooks up with or almost hooks up with in this movie, you have to wonder what was he thinking. Before this review becomes ridiculously long, I need to add that not everyone will like this movie half as much as I did. In fact, a lot of people won't like it at all. It's 168 minutes without the end credits annnd combines so many plot elements, that it bored a lot of people. One person on Amazon said they should've called it ""The Unbearable Boredom of Watching"". So, technically I recommend this movie highly; but don't take my word for it. Hopefully my review will lead you to conclude whether you should watch this movie or waste your time on something else. Either way, this is my grade for it: A",5,Hardly Boring,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,5506,"['Unbearable', 'Lightness', 'Being', 'film', '1988', 'made', 'director', 'Phillip', 'Kaufman', 'caught',

26841,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,0780022386,K. Driscoll,"[13, 13]","I've always felt it is a mistake to compare a film adaptation to its literary counterpart.  The Unbearable Lightness of Being, as a novel, is hugely significant and wonderful.  As a film, it is not necessarily true to the book and that is solely because as a film it is not capable of being true to the book.  I would compare making a movie out of Milan Kundera's novel to making a video game out of the Godfather or Pulp Fiction.  If that was done we run into issues like forgetting to include the priorities of game play, or simply cashing in on the success of the film.  With the Unbearable Lightness of Being, there are inevitably going to be lovers of the book waiting to attack the film, and that has happened.  Of course it prioritizes itself efficiently as a cinematic experience, while at the same time it makes for about as good an adaptation of the novel as you can possibly get.  It wasn't a filmable story to begin with and even Kundera came forward and said that, but he also consulted the writers of the screenplay.  So comparisons between the film and novel are in my opinion pointless but also inescapable.  I've already made them myself.I'm not going to summarize the whole film for you as that would probably be too long-winded and could potentially spoil the story.  I'll introduce the characters, place them in a setting and then say go...and then you can add this to your shopping cart, proceed to check out, and then a few days later press play.  The film takes place in Prague in 1968 just after Alexander Dubcek lead the Prague Spring advancement.  Soon after that the characters suffer through further reform following the eventual invasion of the Soviets and the Warsaw Pact.  The film opens with two characters who are lighthearted and carefree lovers.  Tomas is a surgeon and womanizer who lives life as though sex and love are two very different things.  Sabina is an artist who, in the eyes of Tomas, embodies sex.  Tomas soon meets the more heavyhearted Thereza, a waitress and aspiring photographer, who embodies innocence.  They are opposites but soon Thereza will also embody love in the eyes of Tomas.The characters in The Unbearable Lightness of Being evolve wonderfully in a significant and chaotic backdrop, but they never steer from their passions. It is layered as not only a romance, but also as a story about rebellion, and as an erotic dance; but ultimately it is an existential story.  A few of these points are strengths only realized if the book is read first.  Not that I'd definitely recommend doing that if you haven't already, as the book does stand higher in it's own medium than the film does and you may be setting yourself up for disappointment.  Some of the deeper messages are unquestionably somewhat muted in the film.Again though, judged solely as a cinematic narrative, Director Phillip Kauffman makes The Unbearable Lightness of Being a beautiful movie and delves deeply enough into these characters and their world that he manages to capture some of Kundera's vision, while adding his own motion picture flare.

Philip Kaufman did an excellent job of translating the novel into film, and the acting is top-notch as well. The performances are strong, and some of the more philosophical elements of the  novel are incorporated without creating the awkwardness that might have  resulted in the hands of a less-capable director.The biggest surprise  was the strong European feel of the film. (Yes, the film was set in Europe  - specifically, Prague and Geneva - but American movies shot on location  are usually still identifiably American.) The film's portrayal of the  sexual relationships in the story is remarkably mature - not something  you'd expect from an American film.The quality of the DVD transfer is  vastly superior to the laserdisc. It was particularly gratifying to be able  to watch the film in one sitting, without interruptions, and without having  to change discs halfway through. The additional commentary is good, though  the commentary from the wonderful Lena Olin seems slightly out of place  amongst the more technical commentary of Philip Kaufman and the others  involved.The only drawback to this particular edition is the sound.

The ease with which it depicted sexual relationships was perhaps different than any film I had seen up until then. The irony of the film's title incorporates this attitude, contrasting it with the ""heaviness"" of everything else that life throws at you. Its message is perhaps (I'm guessing) that even when we are happy, and life is refreshingly `easy,' we tend to gravitate to that which will undo this, that which will put us into turmoil and confrontation; we simply can't bear to be happy for too long, for fear that the happiness itself will turn against us, never to be experienced again.As for the film itself, it's very good.

This film explores what happens when people treat each other lightly, when there is an imbalance of attachment between people, when couples' definitions (of love, sex, commitment, etc.) are unequal: Which person is self-centered, selfish even, and which one bears most of the emotional weight?  Whose interests does the couple tend to nurture the most, and who's ideas are often left unexplored until they wither away?The film is a period piece that pits the free expression of sex in 1960s Prague against the backdrop of Communist Russia.  When the Soviet army invades Prague in 1968, the film truly begins, presenting a parallel love story and war story.  This structuring is intentional.  You'll have to decide for yourself how the alternating settings of the film work with the changing relationships of the film's protagonists.  While I think the movie does well with the period and settings, any extremism (from the left or right) seems to me the antithesis of freedom.The three main characters form a triangle that is often found in film noir, but this triangle is more complicated.  The three begin the film under the guises of traditional noir types: Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis) is the great leading man and scoundrel; Tereza (Juliette Binoche) is the adorable nurturing woman; and Sabina (Lena Olin) is the insatiable and ever-fleeting femme fatale.  Once put in motion, however, these character types begin to wobble, although the triangle remains intact throughout the majority of the film.The nudity and sex scenes in the film are quite explicit and are European in their cinematic representations of the body and of sex.  Aside from a few scenes of over-the-top zooming, the cinematography is spectacular, especially in scenes with mirrors.  It might be worth noting that the film is nearly three hours long and requires some patience to watch.  The characters are developed deeply while the plot moves slowly.

And if it is, I think that  tends to happen naturally when a conglomeration of hugely talented  filmmakers tackle epic material; it is gorgeously lensed by the greatest  cinematographer of all time Sven Nykvist, the performances are peerless,  the script is utterly compelling at all times, and the direction proved  Kaufman to be a master. I don't find the film pretentious because i found  the story so involving. I was watching characters not dry literary symbols.  I personally believe something is pretentious only if you dont understand  it. As for the cactus being a phallic symbol, it looks a phallus, so what?  Whats your point?  As for the title, my mother, who is Slavic and was  living in Poland during the 1968 invasion, agrees that Teresa explains it  best in the film: she can't bear to be light and frivolous while her people  are being oppressed. I have seen few films that display the heart and  warmth of this one. It is just as timely and compelling today as it was  twelve years ago. The Criterion DVD has beautiful high resolution imagery  and a great Janacek soundtrack. The commentary track is also enlightening  to hear, as several key people involved in making the film speak candidly  about what they were doing.",5,unbearable lightness - frivolity in the face of revolution,964396800,"07 24, 2000",2000,1651,"['feel', 'i', 'should', 'write', 'something', 'previous', 'review', 'very', 'misleading', 'spiteful', 'always', 'find', 'bizarre', 'when', 'people', 'write', 'review', 'film', 'say', 'quot', 'nothing', 'much', 'happened', 'quot', 'Well', 'did', 'watch', 'film', 'lot', 'happened', 'Soviets', 'invaded', 'Czechoslovakia', 'one', 'thing', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'movie', 'self-important', 'more', 'self-important', 'review', 'wrote', 'sir', 'think', 'happen', 'naturally', 'when', 'conglomeration', 'hugely', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'tackle', 'epic', 'material', 'gorgeously', 'lensed', 'greatest', 'cinematographer', 'time', 'Sven', 'Nykvist', 'performances', 'are', 'peerless', 'script', 'utterly', 'compelling', 'times', 'direction', 'proved', 'Kaufman', 'be', 'master', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'pretentious', 'i', 'found', 'story', 'so', 'involving', 'was', 'watching', 'characters', 'not', 'dry', 'literary', 'symbols', 'personally', 'believe', 'something', 'pretentious', 'only', 'dont', 'understand', 'cactus', 'being', 'phallic', 'symbol', 'phallus', 'what', 'Whats', 'point', 'title', 'mother', 'who', 'Slavic', 'was', 'living', 'Poland', '1968', 'invasion', 'Teresa', 'best', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'be', 'light', 'frivolous', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'oppressed', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'films', 'display', 'heart', 'warmth', 'one', 'just', 'timely', 'compelling', 'today', 'was', 'twelve', 'years', 'ago', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'beautiful', 'high', 'resolution', 'imagery', 'great', 'Janacek', 'soundtrack', 'commentary', 'track', 'also', 'enlightening', 'hear', 'several', 'key', 'people', 'involved', 'making', 'film', 'speak', 'candidly', 'what', 'were', 'doing']",The Unbearable Lightness of Being
26856,A361LE16VBQDP8,0780022386,Robert Bezimienny,"[6, 11]","This movie poses the troubling question, ""Who is more attractive: Juliette Binoche, or Lena Olin?"".  For mine, Juliette is the answer, if only by a whisker (Karenin, a very charming dog, also featured in my deliberations).  Of course, for those of you who are interested, old hatchet-head, Daniel Day-Lewis, is also given more than adequate screen time, and various parts of his mantis-like body are revealed, including his feet, which prove to be quite repulsive.*Kundera's book plays with philosophical concepts for primarily aesthetic purposes, and the film pragmatically dispenses with this philosophical bunting in favour of a focus upon love and desire and, with surprising resonance, upon the intrusion of public life, in the form of politics, into the private.  To extract a conventional and satisfying plot from Kundera's self-conscious and theory-infected text is a credit to the screenwriters - what results is a very watchable, entirely cinematic movie, more in the Hollywood mould than the European arthouse tradition.*A large part of the film's charm lies at the feet of Juliette Binoche (as mentioned previously, Daniel Day Lewis's feet are wholly charmless).  Her incredible capacity to portray joy and exuberance lights up the screen; her darker emotions are equally believable - her performance is superb, and prefigures perhaps her most astonishing role in Kieslowski's 'Blue' (a far superior film to 'Unbearable...', by the way - it's available on DVD from Amazon.co.uk).  Lena Olin is suitably erotic (nice hat), and Daniel, I concede, methodically inhabits his character of Tomas, using one of his inflexible traits as an actor to effect, namely his staunch refusal to reveal himself psychically, a kind of introversion that lends Tomas much needed mystery - after all, here is a hedonist, a lothario, who is also motivated to dedicate his life to neurosurgery and, ultimately if imperfectly, to his wife, an intensely private man who refuses to yield to political pressures - you need a bit of mystery in order to reconcile the contradictions.  Incidentally, all the actors, be they English, French, Swedish, or German, struggle to limp through a Czech accent - forgivable, but not ideal.*The film is long, almost three hours, and falls roughly into three parts, the last possibly being the strongest.  If you wanted to give titles to these three 'chapters', you could try: 'Pornography, Exile, Love'.  That would be glib, true, but if the film has a failing I think it lies somewhere in the vicinity of glibness - there is something a little too easy about its surface, and the dialogue never dares to flash light on any implied depths (in contrast, say, to Bergman, who always attempted just this, taking risks in the process - you might find yourself laughing at some of his most portentious lines, but you won't here, because Kaufman lacks the courage to disturb you).*So, worth a look, for the pretty pictures is nothing else; Criterion provide a good transfer, which you could well expect, although the actual print shows some signs of wear and tear, oddly so considering its tender age.  Criterion have also lost the rights to this picture, so it is out of print as of late 2001 - so order now before Amazon runs out (other retailers already have).",4,Daniel Day Lewis should keep his shoes on,1014076800,"02 19, 2002",2002,3278,"['movie', 'troubling', 'question', 'Who', 'more', 'attractive', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'mine', 'Juliette', 'answer', 'only', 'whisker', 'Karenin', 'very', 'charming', 'dog', 'also', 'featured', 'deliberations', 'course', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'old', 'hatchet-head', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'also', 'given', 'more', 'adequate', 'screen', 'time', 'various', 'parts', 'mantis-like', 'body', 'are', 'revealed', 'including', 'feet', 'prove', 'be', 'quite', 'repulsive', '*Kundera', 'book', 'philosophical', 'concepts', 'primarily', 'aesthetic', 'purposes', 'film', 'pragmatically', 'philosophical', 'bunting', 'favour', 'focus', 'love', 'desire', 'surprising', 'resonance', 'intrusion', 'public', 'life', 'form', 'politics', 'private', 'extract', 'conventional', 'satisfying', 'plot', 'Kundera', 'self-conscious', 'theory-infected', 'text', 'credit', 'screenwriters', 'what', 'results', 'very', 'watchable', 'entirely', 'cinematic', 'movie', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'mould', 'European', 'arthouse', 'tradition', '*A', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'charm', 'feet', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'mentioned', 'previously', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'feet', 'are', 'wholly', 'charmless', 'incredible', 'capacity', 'portray', 'joy', 'exuberance', 'lights', 'screen', 'darker', 'emotions', 'are', 'equally', 'believable', 'performance', 'superb', 'perhaps', 'most', 'astonishing', 'role', 'Kieslowski', ""'Blue"", 'far', 'superior', 'film', ""'Unbearable"", 'way', 'available', 'DVD', 'Amazon.co.uk', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'suitably', 'erotic', 'nice', 'hat', 'Daniel', 'concede', 'methodically', 'character', 'Tomas', 'using', 'one', 'inflexible', 'traits', 'actor', 'effect', 'namely', 'staunch', 'refusal', 'reveal', 'psychically', 'kind', 'introversion', 'Tomas', 'much', 'needed', 'mystery', 'here', 'hedonist', 'lothario', 'who', 'also', 'motivated', 'dedicate', 'life', 'ultimately', 'imperfectly', 'wife', 'intensely', 'private', 'man', 'who', 'yield', 'political', 'pressures', 'need', 'bit', 'mystery', 'order', 'reconcile', 'contradictions', 'Incidentally', 'actors', 'be', 'English', 'French', 'Swedish', 'German', 'struggle', 'limp', 'Czech', 'accent', 'forgivable', 'not', 'ideal', '*The', 'film', 'long', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'roughly', 'three', 'parts', 'last', 'possibly', 'being', 'strongest', 'wanted', 'give', 'titles', 'three', ""'chapters"", 'could', 'try', ""'Pornography"", 'Exile', 'Love', 'would', 'be', 'glib', 'true', 'film', 'failing', 'think', 'somewhere', 'vicinity', 'glibness', 'something', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'surface', 'dialogue', 'never', 'flash', 'light', 'implied', 'depths', 'contrast', 'say', 'Bergman', 'who', 'always', 'attempted', 'just', 'taking', 'risks', 'process', 'might', 'find', 'laughing', 'most', 'portentious', 'lines', 'wo', ""n't"", 'here', 'Kaufman', 'courage', 'disturb', '*So', 'look', 'pretty', 'nothing', 'else', 'Criterion', 'good', 'transfer', 'could', 'well', 'expect', 'actual', 'print', 'signs', 'wear', 'tear', 'oddly', 'so', 'considering', 'tender', 'age', 'Criterion', 'have', 'also', 'lost', 'rights', 'picture', 'print', 'late', '2001', 'so', 'order', 'now', 'Amazon', 'out', 'other', 'retailers', 'already', 'have']",The Unbearable Lightness of Being

Day-Lewis is perfect as Tomas, the sardonic Lothario.  Olin is blood-boiling as Sabina, the incarnation of freedom.  And Binoche is captivating as Terersa, the woman for whom Tomas gives up everything.  This a stirring, heartbreaking movie.  The only problem is that it lacks Kundera's inimitable *voice*, the witty, erudite mini-essays he uses to iluustrate his philosophical points.

26859,A3P6XT8Y1FEF3,0780022386,Seamus,"[12, 16]","I know it's not really fair to compare a book to a movie, and I've heard before that if you're interested in both you should always see the film first, that way you're not let down with the way it was adapted from the novel.  But in this case, I read the novel first so it's impossible for me to not judge the film in that light.I don't know whether to blame the casting or the acting/direction, but I wasn't happy with any of the main characters.  Daniel Day Lewis, who I normally like, plays Tomas with a constant smirk on his face that makes him hard to take seriously.  In the novel, he's an intellectual, but in the movie he seems like nothing more than a confused male who's obsessed with sex.Juliette Binoche's Tereza seems like a caricature.  In the book, she's a sad, somewhat innocent woman from a small Czech town.  In the movie she's played like a typical French ingenue.  She seems like she would fit better into Amelie than she does in Kundera's masterpiece.Lena Olin's Sabina is not as bad, but she still seems to lack the sensuality or seriousness of the character in the novel.Of course, there are many things that are left out from the book, and that is to be expected in any adaptation.  The movie doesn't spend very much time on Sabina in Switzerland.  The character of Franz is just glossed over, and the part about Tomas having a wife and son is completely left out, which may seem forgiveable, but in reading the book I thought the fact that Tomas had been in a failed marriage made his womanizing a little more understandable.None of this is to say that the movie is without merit.  There are some spectacular scenes and moments, and it's hard not to be touched at times.  But it all just feels a little rushed, even in 3 hours.  This could have easily been a mini-series and perhaps then the characters could have been developed properly and the viewer would get to know Tomas and Tereza.  As it is, it's a good movie that in the end comes off feeling like a slightly less erotic version of ""Last Tango in Paris.""",3,From Someone Who's Read the Book,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,2038,"['know', 'not', 'really', 'fair', 'compare', 'book', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'heard', ""'re"", 'interested', 'should', 'always', 'see', 'film', 'first', 'way', ""'re"", 'not', 'let', 'down', 'way', 'was', 'adapted', 'novel', 'case', 'read', 'novel', 'first', 'impossible', 'not', 'judge', 'film', 'light.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'blame', 'casting', 'acting/direction', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'main', 'characters', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'who', 'normally', 'Tomas', 'constant', 'smirk', 'face', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'novel', 'intellectual', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'confused', 'male', 'who', 'obsessed', 'sex.Juliette', 'Binoche', 'Tereza', 'caricature', 'book', 'sad', 'somewhat', 'innocent', 'woman', 'small', 'Czech', 'town', 'movie', 'played', 'typical', 'French', 'ingenue', 'would', 'fit', 'better', 'Amelie', 'Kundera', 'masterpiece.Lena', 'Olin', 'Sabina', 'not', 'bad', 'still', 'lack', 'sensuality', 'seriousness', 'character', 'novel.Of', 'course', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'book', 'be', 'expected', 'adaptation', 'movie', ""n't"", 'spend', 'very', 'much', 'time', 'Sabina', 'Switzerland', 'character', 'Franz', 'just', 'glossed', 'over', 'part', 'Tomas', 'having', 'wife', 'son', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'may', 'seem', 'forgiveable', 'reading', 'book', 'thought', 'fact', 'Tomas', 'had', 'been', 'failed', 'marriage', 'made', 'womanizing', 'little', 'more', 'understandable.None', 'say', 'movie', 'merit', 'are', 'spectacular', 'scenes', 'moments', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'touched', 'times', 'just', 'little', 'rushed', 'even', '3', 'hours', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'mini-series', 'perhaps', 'then', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'properly', 'viewer', 'would', 'get', 'know', 'Tomas', 'Tereza', 'good', 'movie', 'end', 'off', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'less', 'erotic', 'version', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris']",The Unbearable Lightness of Being

With such liberties staunchly repressed under the dictat of the former Soviet Union, sexual expression becomes a cry for freedom within itself. The movie is erotic, yes, but it carries a whiff of mischief rather than being purposeless, gratuitous ""softporn"" as some reviewers lament.Daniel Day-Lewis is pretty decent as Tomas, toggling between a brain surgeon and a Lothario. His performance is disciplined and understated as events overtake Tomas's ability to control his destiny. He has an arrangement with Sabina (Lena Olin), a sculptor who also can find no place for love without freedom in her life. Their relationship is based upon friendship and convenience. Their lovemaking is passionate but not empty or cold. If there is love, it is left unspoken.Kaufman uses this relationship as the foundation of the movie with most of the dynamic being centered upon the naive country girl (a very fresh and intriguing Juliette Binoche) who rebels against the crushing of the Prague Spring by photographing the brutality.The trio escape to Switzerland. Geneva then plays a major role in this film as being emblematic of an alternative freedom; a freedom that feels heavy with responsibility. Maybe, within western democracy, when everybody has a voice, then the individual can no longer be heard. Maybe, if there are no small victories, then there is no true lightness. Their freedom can only be felt within context.Finally, Thomas and Tereza return home to a Soviet Prague. Again, via censure, the communists provide the answer.Sabina finds a beach side property in California, opting for bland airbrushed seascapes. She lives alone. Her spirit has been quelled by the freedom that surrounds her.This is truly a beautiful European film, perhaps not too palatable to Hollywood-tainted tastes. Despite its length (which does tend to drag a little)  and its erotic texture, I believe it follows its own moral vein.A thought provoking dash of cinema, highly recommended for any connoisseur's collections!",4,A TOUCH TOO LONG BUT THOUGHTFUL.,1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,2170,"['Do', 'favor', 'read', 'Kundera', 'book', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'nuances', 'movie', 'things', 'what', 'lightness', 'stood', 'freedom', 'self', 'sexual', 'expression', 'such', 'liberties', 'staunchly', 'repressed', 'dictat', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'sexual', 'expression', 'cry', 'freedom', 'movie', 'erotic', 'yes', 'whiff', 'mischief', 'rather', 'being', 'purposeless', 'gratuitous', 'softporn', 'reviewers', 'lament.Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Tomas', 'toggling', 'brain', 'surgeon', 'Lothario', 'performance', 'disciplined', 'understated', 'events', 'overtake', 'Tomas', 'ability', 'control', 'destiny', 'arrangement', 'Sabina', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'sculptor', 'who', 'also', 'can', 'find', 'place', 'love', 'freedom', 'life', 'relationship', 'based', 'friendship', 'convenience', 'lovemaking', 'passionate', 'not', 'empty', 'cold', 'love', 'left', 'unspoken.Kaufman', 'relationship', 'foundation', 'movie', 'most', 'dynamic', 'being', 'centered', 'naive', 'country', 'girl', 'very', 'fresh', 'intriguing', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'who', 'crushing', 'Prague', 'Spring', 'photographing', 'brutality.The', 'trio', 'escape', 'Switzerland', 'Geneva', 'then', 'major', 'role', 'film', 'being', 'emblematic', 'alternative', 'freedom', 'freedom', 'heavy', 'responsibility', 'Maybe', 'western', 'democracy', 'when', 'everybody', 'voice', 'then', 'individual', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'heard', 'Maybe', 'are', 'small', 'victories', 'then', 'true', 'lightness', 'freedom', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'felt', 'context.Finally', 'Thomas', 'Tereza', 'return', 'home', 'Soviet', 'Prague', 'Again', 'censure', 'communists', 'provide', 'answer.Sabina', 'beach', 'side', 'property', 'California', 'opting', 'bland', 'airbrushed', 'seascapes', 'alone', 'spirit', 'been', 'quelled', 'freedom', 'her.This', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'European', 'film', 'perhaps', 'not', 'too', 'palatable', 'Hollywood-tainted', 'tastes', 'length', 'tend', 'drag', 'little', 'erotic', 'texture', 'believe', 'own', 'moral', 'vein.A', 'thought', 'provoking', 'dash', 'cinema', 'highly', 'recommended', 'connoisseur', 'collections']",The Unbearable Lightness of Being

The ensuing results are quite original.The film is also a good history lesson about the Soviet invasion but is not appropriate for school age children. The film has a well deserved R rating for scenes of nudity and sex which I think were unnecessary and prevent a wider range of audience from seeing the film.

26866,ATLA5CJH0ZZHP,0780022386,Terry R. Nye,"[23, 85]","""The Unbearable Boredom of Watching.""  That's what this movie should have been titled.  It is a long, relentless, punishingly dull movie following the lives of three people intertwined by a common relationship with each other.  Two of them, Tomas and his mistress, Sabina, are talented yet shallow hedonists who seem to have no interest in pursuing anything greater or more meaningful than sexual gratification.  Tomas' young wife, Tereza, is a sad, pathetic, naive woman who is devoted to her husband despite her knowledge of his ongoing affair with Sabina.  The story takes place in the 1960's era of Communist oppression in Czechoslovakia.After spending about 3 hours watching this movie, one comes away struggling to find some meaning in it all.  There were opportunities to make an interesting movie -- the tension between the women who share a common lover, the impact of Communist oppression on the lives of Tomas and his wife are but two examples -- but the writers and director chose an incredibly boring and meaningless path instead.  There are several episodes of gratuitous sex, nudity, and a lengthy homoerotic scene between Sabina and Tereza that add nothing to the meaning, quality, or entertainment of this movie.I can really find no reason to recommend this movie.  If you are looking for a love story or a fascinating tale about interesting people and their lives, you will be sorely disappointed.

26868,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,0780022386,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[160, 172]","Now this is a movie!Perhaps the most amazing thing about this film is that an American directed it. It feels so European, and not faux-European--it needs to be done this way. Or perhaps it's really not so surprising, on second thought. I've long observed how European or Europe-born directors make the best American films (Louis Malle with Atlantic City, Roman Polanski with Chinatown, even Paul Mazursky with Moscow on the Hudson), so why not the reverse?At any rate, after making a somewhat cynical American movie (The Right Stuff), Kaufman reinvented himself as his exact polar opposite, directing this relatively innocent film about the ""Prague Spring"" and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. I say ""innocent"" even though the film is best remembered (in Puritan America at least) for the explicit sex scenes that, to me, are not shocking and are not even the first thing (or second, or third) to come to mind when I think of this marvelous film. Instead I remember Sabina's hat, the quiet moments between her and Tomas, and the feeling pervading the film that life is fleeting, happiness elusive, and life-altering changes lurk around every corner. Instead I marvel at how the film manages to *suggest* the existential novel it came from, even though Kaufman chose not to try to adapt the huge existential portions of Kundera's book. This is a movie about time and place, and indentity, or lack of it; about commitment, about how heavy life seems or doesn't seem dependant upon the government you are stuck with.  This is a movie about freedom, who can handle it, and who can't.  This is a movie about courage, who has it and who doesn't, and I don't mean just the people who stood up on the tanks.  Recall that the young and very verbal doctor who was most enthusiastic about Tomas publishing his article is quickest to turn tail and embrace the communists after the invasion.Most of all this is a movie that realizes you don't have to have a linear plot to create great film--on the contrary, film embraces such nonlinear story-telling.  At the same time, Kaufman never feels compelled to venture into surrealism or symbolism.  (He did consider it for the ending, as he reveals on the commentary track.)  For some reason all this, and a genuine ignorance of Czech culture and history, has made this film a little tough for many American critics and viewers to swallow.  They give it polite, superficial praise, but reading between the lines we get the feeling some of them are saying ""What's it *really* about, beyond great sex?""Both Daniel Day Lewis and Lena Olin are excellent, and of course Olin's performance has received much attention and commentary because of her high-octane sex scenes (though comparisons to Last Tango seem wrong to me; LT was very cynical in is treatment of male-female relationships, whereas what makes this film work so well is the fact that it's rather innocent in that way). But the real standout--one of the greatest performances I've ever seen on a movie screen--belongs to Juliette Binoche. Her Tereza is attractive but gawky, poised by awkward, shy yet take-charge when it's needed. She is meek around Tomas yet grabs her camera and runs fearlessly into danger when the Russians invade. Binoche's performance is so astonishing we can reconcile these contradictions and in fact don't even question them. That she was never Oscar-nominated is astonishing. (This film received a grand total of two nominations and no awards--proof, if it was needed, that the Academy is retarded, considering such second-rate films as The Accidental Tourist and Rain Man took home big trophies.)Criterion's DVD is very fine, though a little short on extras.  (Not even a trailer!)  There are, however, fascinating commentaries by Kaufman, screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere, Lena Olin and others. I would have liked a ""Making of"" featurette too, but that's because I'm greedy. The picture is dark and solid as you'd expect from cinematographer Sven Nykvist, although on a large-screen TV you see more scratches and dust than maybe should be in such an important release.  The sound very good if not THX-caliber, but this film doesn't need it.Yet another film on my favorites list that no one would dare make today.  Recently this has been reissued on a double-DVD set.  I haven't seen the new incarnation, but I understand from reviews the movie is *split over two discs.*  While the film is longish, it can fit on one disc, as it does here.  Also, the new documentary apparently contains comments from mostly the same people who are on the commentary track, so the material largely duplicates said track.  Also the commentary track on the new edition is reportedly exactly the same as this Criterion edition.  Given all that, I see no compelling reason to buy the new version, but I do wish someone would put out a definitively-remastered and richly detailed DVD of ULoB someday.",5,Kaufman's

26871,A220FJEQNGMSRN,0780022386,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","The Unbearable Lightness of Being is one of those occasional attempts by American filmmakers to make a European arthouse movie in English, in this case taking on an `unfilmable' novel and trying to solve the problem of turning inner monologue into a credible narrative. Despite, or perhaps because of Jean-Claude Carriere's presence as co-writer with director Philip Kaufman, this tends to take the form of the odd conversation between shags rather than an attempt to turn ideas into images, leaving a rather conventional narrative about a philandering surgeon who ultimately needs the oppression of the Russian invasion rather than the freedom of the Czech Spring to focus his emotional commitments and principles. Some of this is done well, some of it less well, but at the end of the day it's just a love story, although it deals well with the personal consequences of the political crackdown and the ending is quietly moving. Which, in a way, reflects some kind of emotional triumph - whereas for most of the film we don't really care for the characters, merely go along with them, by the end, like he hero, we have at least attained some genuine level of emotional commitment.Whether that entirely justifies 171-minutes of screen time is debatable, though in its defense the film never feels that long. There are moments that grate, not least the sporadically clumsy integration of the main characters into archive footage of the Russian invasion that draws attention to itself by the crude device of adding scratches only to the new footage. The photography session doesn't quite work either despite an interesting start, not quite pulling off the shift of power and veering off into self-indulgence. The performances are slightly problematic too, especially with the Czechs limited to the smaller supporting roles in an Anglo-French-Swedish-American cast leading to a variety of composite accents (often more Germanic than Slav) and a feeling that the casting directors thought ""Yeah, he sounds foreign, he'll do"" at times. Daniel Day Lewis fares well as the coldly charismatic and fickle doc but still hadn't shrugged off that well-trained British stage actor feel to his performances; Juliette Binoche is genuinely appealing in one of her more open performances, although it's a bit of a stretch that her character never loses her naivet&eacute;; but as the more passionate of his loves Lena Olin is somewhat more problematic, her performance getting less convincing as the film progresses until rediscovering its humanity in her final scene. Of the supporting players, Erland Josephon has one good scene as a former ambassador reduced to being a janitor that underlines the way that even love and sex can be used as weapons of political oppression merely through the introduction of doubt - an idea that becomes strangely more powerful because of the way Kaufman frequently fails to summon up much in the way of eroticism because he generally regards sex as joyfully comic.Annoyingly the film has been split across two discs, although the break isn't quite as abrupt as on some other discs. The DVD boasts a good transfer with an interesting audio commentary and good half hour documentary that illustrates that even if they didn't entirely succeed at least the filmmakers were trying to create something of real substance.",3,Just another love story,1179446400,"05 18, 2007",2007,3333,"['Unbearable', 'Lightness', 'Being', 'one', 'occasional', 'attempts', 'American', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'European', 'arthouse', 'movie', 'English', 'case', 'taking', 'unfilmable', 'novel', 'trying', 'solve', 'problem', 'turning', 'inner', 'monologue', 'credible', 'narrative', 'perhaps', 'Jean-Claude', 'Carriere', 'presence', 'co-writer', 'director', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'take', 'form', 'odd', 'conversation', 'shags', 'rather', 'attempt', 'turn', 'ideas', 'images', 'leaving', 'rather', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'philandering', 'surgeon', 'who', 'ultimately', 'oppression', 'Russian', 'invasion', 'rather', 'freedom', 'Czech', 'Spring', 'focus', 'emotional', 'commitments', 'principles', 'done', 'well', 'less', 'well', 'end', 'day', 'just', 'love', 'story', 'well', 'personal', 'consequences', 'political', 'crackdown', 'ending', 'quietly', 'moving', 'Which', 'way', 'kind', 'emotional', 'triumph', 'whereas', 'most', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'merely', 'go', 'along', 'end', 'have', 'least', 'attained', 'genuine', 'level', 'emotional', 'commitment.Whether', 'entirely', '171-minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'debatable', 'though', 'defense', 'film', 'never', 'long', 'are', 'moments', 'grate', 'not', 'least', 'sporadically', 'clumsy', 'integration', 'main', 'characters', 'archive', 'footage', 'Russian', 'invasion', 'attention', 'crude', 'device', 'adding', 'scratches', 'only', 'new', 'footage', 'photography', 'session', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'either', 'interesting', 'start', 'not', 'quite', 'pulling', 'off', 'shift', 'power', 'veering', 'off', 'self-indulgence', 'performances', 'are', 'slightly', 'problematic', 'too', 'especially', 'Czechs', 'limited', 'smaller', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Anglo-French-Swedish-American', 'cast', 'leading', 'variety', 'composite', 'accents', 'often', 'more', 'Germanic', 'Slav', 'feeling', 'casting', 'directors', 'thought', 'Yeah', 'foreign', ""'ll"", 'do', 'times', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'well', 'coldly', 'charismatic', 'fickle', 'doc', 'still', 'had', ""n't"", 'shrugged', 'off', 'well-trained', 'British', 'stage', 'actor', 'feel', 'performances', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'genuinely', 'appealing', 'one', 'more', 'open', 'performances', 'bit', 'stretch', 'character', 'never', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'more', 'passionate', 'loves', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'somewhat', 'more', 'problematic', 'performance', 'getting', 'less', 'convincing', 'film', 'rediscovering', 'humanity', 'final', 'scene', 'supporting', 'players', 'Erland', 'Josephon', 'one', 'good', 'scene', 'former', 'ambassador', 'reduced', 'being', 'janitor', 'way', 'even', 'love', 'sex', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'weapons', 'political', 'oppression', 'merely', 'introduction', 'doubt', 'idea', 'strangely', 'more', 'powerful', 'way', 'Kaufman', 'frequently', 'summon', 'up', 'much', 'way', 'eroticism', 'generally', 'sex', 'joyfully', 'film', 'been', 'split', 'two', 'discs', 'break', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'abrupt', 'other', 'discs', 'DVD', 'good', 'transfer', 'interesting', 'audio', 'commentary', 'good', 'half', 'hour', 'documentary', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'succeed', 'least', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'create', 'something', 'real', 'substance']",The Unbearable Lightness of Being
