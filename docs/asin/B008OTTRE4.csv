1573201,AYG1U47VFZ165,B008OTTRE4,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[4, 7]","There was an explosion of foreign cinema coming to American shores throughout the 70's and 80's that largely consisted of grindhouse-type entertainment.  Italian production companies were churning out some interesting splatter and gore; the French were making some clever forays into pretentious artsy flicks as well as melodramatic romances; while the smaller Chinese and Japanese companies were putting out an awful lot of what many of us called `chopsocky' - kung fu and karate films light on story but heavy on action, though quite a bit of it required the audience to suspend their disbelief of concepts as elemental as gravity.  These heavily cloaked fighters could jump and soar when delivered kicks and punches and holds, and they'd almost dance across the silver screen with heavy swords, spears, and clubs flailing magically.  You never had to think all that much about story, and you were - at best - modestly entertained.LEGENDARY AMAZONS pretty much follows in the vein of those imports from three to four decades ago.  Set during the days when men of the Yang Clan were massacred on the battlefield, a group of women - all ages - suit up and march out to kick some serious butt.  Each of the ladies has a special gift with a sword or a spear or some particular fighting skills, and there will be hell to pay if the ladies - think of them as `The Expendabelles' - won't help their families throw off oppression, re-establish the rule of their husbands and fathers, and maybe (just maybe) build a whole new world for you and me.Meh.For all intents and purposes, the action remains pretty constant from start to finish, so much so that I found it quite difficult to distinguish so much when one battle ended and another one started.  That may not be a detriment - after all, this is billed as a ""legendary martial arts spectacular"" - and I would imagine folks who enjoy their `chopsocky' with few distractions will have something to look forward to her.  Me?  I tend to like my films with more story - it helps me to establish things like conflict, theme, and motivation - but I'd be lying if I didn't point out that quite a bit of the fight choreography is impressive.However, there's a fair amount of this that's clearly been accomplished by speeding up the film by the smallest increments; regardless of its effectiveness (which is debatable), I've always found that a distraction.  It reminds me that I'm watching a film and not experiencing a physical match-up in real time.  There's nothing wrong with a little camera trickery, but when an entire picture relies on it I tend to think that some elements of the production needed to be re-conceived.Also, it's never a bad thing to stuff a film with as many pretty faces as you can find.  Cecilia Cheung, Cheng Pei-Pei, and Liu Ziaoqing aren't too shabby to look at for the course of 108 minutes, and that translates to some modest moments of entertainment for even the most discriminating viewer.LEGENDARY AMAZONS is produced by Shanghai Film Group Corporation, China Media Cultural Industry Investment Co Ltd, Beijing Shaitengfei Movie and Teleplay Cultural Media Co Ltd, Dao Culture Investment Ltd, and a whole host of others.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled through Well Go USA.  Picture and sound quality are exceptional, and the production quality is quite good throughout.  There's a brief behind-the-scenes featurette available, along with the theatrical trailer, and that's all she wrote: nothing impressive, just more of the routine, much like the produced picture.RECOMMENDED only for fans of traditional martial arts films.  While I've read others who've pegged the picture as ""a genre breakthrough,"" I'd caution them to actually go back, seek out, and watch some of the imports I mentioned above; I think they'll find that there's really nothing `groundbreaking' on display here.  There's nothing wrong with LEGENDARY AMAZONS, but there's really not all that much interesting in it either.  Excellent costuming and set pieces elevate the feel of the production, but so much of the production relies on rather obvious wire-fu and somewhat dated camera trickery to accomplish these feats and fisticuffs.  Still, it's harmless fodder for those inclined - kind of a brain-candy action flick - and, on that level, it mostly succeeds.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA provided me with a DVD screener copy of LEGENDARY AMAZONS for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",2,"LEGENDARY AMAZONS Is Far From ""Legendary"" But Still Entertaining",1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,4520,"['was', 'explosion', 'foreign', 'cinema', 'coming', 'American', 'shores', '70', '80', 'largely', 'consisted', 'grindhouse-type', 'entertainment', 'Italian', 'production', 'companies', 'were', 'churning', 'out', 'interesting', 'splatter', 'gore', 'French', 'were', 'making', 'clever', 'forays', 'pretentious', 'artsy', 'flicks', 'as', 'well', 'melodramatic', 'romances', 'smaller', 'Chinese', 'Japanese', 'companies', 'were', 'putting', 'out', 'awful', 'lot', 'what', 'many', 'called', 'chopsocky', 'kung', 'fu', 'karate', 'films', 'light', 'story', 'heavy', 'action', 'quite', 'bit', 'required', 'audience', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'concepts', 'elemental', 'gravity', 'heavily', 'cloaked', 'fighters', 'could', 'jump', 'soar', 'when', 'delivered', 'kicks', 'punches', ""'d"", 'almost', 'dance', 'silver', 'screen', 'heavy', 'swords', 'spears', 'clubs', 'flailing', 'magically', 'never', 'had', 'think', 'that', 'much', 'story', 'were', 'best', 'modestly', 'entertained.LEGENDARY', 'AMAZONS', 'pretty', 'much', 'vein', 'imports', 'three', 'four', 'decades', 'ago', 'Set', 'days', 'when', 'men', 'Yang', 'Clan', 'were', 'massacred', 'battlefield', 'group', 'women', 'ages', 'suit', 'up', 'march', 'out', 'kick', 'serious', 'butt', 'ladies', 'special', 'gift', 'sword', 'spear', 'particular', 'fighting', 'skills', 'will', 'be', 'hell', 'pay', 'ladies', 'think', 'Expendabelles', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'families', 'throw', 'oppression', 're-establish', 'rule', 'husbands', 'fathers', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'build', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'me.Meh.For', 'intents', 'purposes', 'action', 'pretty', 'constant', 'start', 'finish', 'so', 'much', 'found', 'quite', 'difficult', 'distinguish', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'one', 'battle', 'ended', 'one', 'started', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'detriment', 'billed', 'legendary', 'martial', 'arts', 'spectacular', 'would', 'imagine', 'folks', 'who', 'enjoy', 'chopsocky', 'few', 'distractions', 'will', 'have', 'something', 'look', 'forward', 'Me', 'tend', 'like', 'films', 'more', 'story', 'establish', 'things', 'conflict', 'theme', 'motivation', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'did', ""n't"", 'point', 'out', 'quite', 'bit', 'fight', 'choreography', 'impressive.However', 'fair', 'amount', 'clearly', 'been', 'accomplished', 'speeding', 'up', 'film', 'smallest', 'increments', 'regardless', 'effectiveness', 'debatable', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'distraction', ""'m"", 'watching', 'film', 'not', 'experiencing', 'physical', 'match-up', 'real', 'time', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'little', 'camera', 'trickery', 'when', 'entire', 'picture', 'relies', 'tend', 'think', 'elements', 'production', 'needed', 'be', 're-conceived.Also', 'never', 'bad', 'thing', 'stuff', 'film', 'many', 'pretty', 'can', 'find', 'Cecilia', 'Cheung', 'Cheng', 'Pei-Pei', 'Liu', 'Ziaoqing', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'shabby', 'look', 'course', '108', 'minutes', 'modest', 'moments', 'entertainment', 'even', 'most', 'discriminating', 'viewer.LEGENDARY', 'AMAZONS', 'produced', 'Shanghai', 'Film', 'Group', 'Corporation', 'China', 'Media', 'Cultural', 'Industry', 'Investment', 'Co', 'Ltd', 'Beijing', 'Shaitengfei', 'Movie', 'Teleplay', 'Cultural', 'Media', 'Co', 'Ltd', 'Dao', 'Culture', 'Investment', 'Ltd', 'whole', 'host', 'others', 'DVD', 'distribution', 'stateside', 'being', 'handled', 'Well', 'Go', 'USA', 'Picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'exceptional', 'production', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'brief', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'available', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'wrote', 'nothing', 'impressive', 'just', 'more', 'routine', 'much', 'produced', 'picture.RECOMMENDED', 'only', 'fans', 'traditional', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', ""'ve"", 'read', 'others', 'who', ""'ve"", 'pegged', 'picture', 'genre', 'breakthrough', ""'d"", 'caution', 'actually', 'go', 'back', 'seek', 'out', 'watch', 'imports', 'mentioned', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'really', 'nothing', 'groundbreaking', 'display', 'here', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'LEGENDARY', 'AMAZONS', 'really', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'interesting', 'Excellent', 'costuming', 'set', 'pieces', 'elevate', 'feel', 'production', 'so', 'much', 'production', 'relies', 'rather', 'obvious', 'wire-fu', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'camera', 'trickery', 'accomplish', 'feats', 'fisticuffs', 'Still', 'harmless', 'fodder', 'inclined', 'kind', 'brain-candy', 'action', 'flick', 'level', 'mostly', 'interests', 'fairness', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'disclose', 'fine', 'folks', 'Well', 'Go', 'USA', 'provided', 'DVD', 'screener', 'copy', 'LEGENDARY', 'AMAZONS', 'expressed', 'purposes', 'completing', 'review']",N/A

One person brags of their extensive Asian action movie collection then calls the plot & action of this movie silly...SILLY ? Its based on facts you silly man!!! So how can you blame the brothers Chan for a silly true story? Apparently your knowledge of the Asian culture is limited to Kung Fu theater! This movie is visually stunning reminiscent of the 50's & 60's color epic's. The costumes & armor are like a peek into ancient china & contrary to some reviews they do a great job making four generations of characters endearing to the viewer, they even take the time to write a profile of many of the characters while their practicing with their weapon of choice. Yes there is use of wired stunts but again this helps reflect the supernatural aspects of Chinese story telling of their hero's. I would imagine a movie about Michael Jordan's athletic feats would need some wire work to help relay his incredible hang time!  For many years Chinese action sequences had to be slowed down so the western eye could follow the action when shown in the U.S.A.. I am happy to be able to watch this in English although the dubbing process does take away a little from the acting, which isn't half bad. Over all I am very happy to add this historically true story to my sword & sorcery & historical film collection. I guess I really can't blame someone for thinking real life is silly...after all quite often the truth is stranger than fiction.

1573216,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B008OTTRE4,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[1, 4]","There goes that, what they call Wuxia action scenes, put in an another asian action film.  Ever since I first saw ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", I've really had a difficult time finding a great asian action or asian war film that doesn't look all so cheesy and ridiculous because of the actors taking flight when they jump or even throwing somebody through the air.They say this movie is based on a ""true story"" which I was prepared to think that the fighting performances will have to look real and convincing. But no, they went and ruined it.  Everyone's flying in the air like ""fairies"".  Now, I know that it must take alot of work to prepare a split second performance of taking to the air when they are jumping from one hidden platform to another, but even with all that work, the end result still looks so fake and disappointing.  We all know how true, the natural flow of common sense inertia appears to the eyes, so with all that work that they put in their pansy-looking ascending jumps, it's all just another stomach-wretching moment to the skeptical viewer.The scenery all looks good though. The costumes are really nice, but I've seen prettier asian girls in other films so this film lacked alot of that, as well. And I usually prefer to listen to the natural language (and try to comprehensively follow intently by reading the subtitles), but I wanted to at least try the English dubbing once, and I found that disappointing too.  The English dubbing seems like it was done with a half-hearted effort, and therefore, rather unconvincing. Some of the girls voices sounded like children, half the ages of the actresses on the screen.Well, anyway, with my expecting so much more than I got (the trailer looked good), I've watched this, (actually I'd rather say I struggled through it), and I'm just gonna give it to one of my young cousins. I guess I've gotta stop depending on watching movie trailers because they seem to be rather deceptive at selling a good movie. I don't think any of that flying around nonsense was in the trailer.I've noticed that it is gonna be hard for the asian film industry to top ""Red Cliff"" and ""Warriors of The Rainbow: Seediq Bale"", because those are the best asian films I've seen since ""Musa: The Warrior"".",1,"A good story, however, very compromised by poorly done acrobatics, and more",1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,2253,"['what', 'call', 'Wuxia', 'action', 'scenes', 'put', 'asian', 'action', 'film', 'Ever', 'first', 'saw', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', ""'ve"", 'really', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'finding', 'great', 'asian', 'action', 'asian', 'war', 'film', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'cheesy', 'ridiculous', 'actors', 'taking', 'flight', 'when', 'jump', 'even', 'throwing', 'somebody', 'air.They', 'say', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'prepared', 'think', 'fighting', 'performances', 'will', 'have', 'look', 'real', 'convincing', 'went', 'ruined', 'Everyone', 'flying', 'air', 'fairies', 'Now', 'know', 'must', 'take', 'alot', 'work', 'prepare', 'split', 'second', 'performance', 'taking', 'air', 'when', 'are', 'jumping', 'one', 'hidden', 'platform', 'even', 'work', 'end', 'result', 'still', 'so', 'fake', 'disappointing', 'know', 'how', 'true', 'natural', 'flow', 'common', 'sense', 'inertia', 'eyes', 'work', 'put', 'pansy-looking', 'ascending', 'jumps', 'just', 'stomach-wretching', 'moment', 'skeptical', 'viewer.The', 'scenery', 'good', 'costumes', 'are', 'really', 'nice', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'prettier', 'asian', 'girls', 'other', 'films', 'film', 'lacked', 'alot', 'as', 'well', 'usually', 'prefer', 'listen', 'natural', 'language', 'try', 'comprehensively', 'follow', 'intently', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'wanted', 'least', 'try', 'English', 'dubbing', 'once', 'found', 'disappointing', 'too', 'English', 'dubbing', 'was', 'done', 'half-hearted', 'effort', 'therefore', 'rather', 'unconvincing', 'girls', 'voices', 'sounded', 'children', 'ages', 'actresses', 'screen.Well', 'anyway', 'expecting', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'got', 'trailer', 'looked', 'good', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'actually', ""'d"", 'rather', 'say', 'struggled', ""'m"", 'just', 'gon', 'na', 'give', 'one', 'young', 'cousins', 'guess', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'stop', 'depending', 'watching', 'movie', 'trailers', 'seem', 'be', 'rather', 'deceptive', 'selling', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'flying', 'nonsense', 'was', 'trailer.I', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'hard', 'asian', 'film', 'industry', 'top', 'Red', 'Cliff', 'Warriors', 'Rainbow', 'Seediq', 'Bale', 'are', 'best', 'asian', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Musa', 'Warrior']",N/A
