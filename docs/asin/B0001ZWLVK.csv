Dennehy plays a lawyer who is called upon to defend an old Vietnam buddy for the brutal slaying of three Vietnamese youths who supposedly attacked his wife and then were found not guilty.  Dennehy's investigation leads to a coverup, and he works hard to find the real culprit.  The identity is pretty unexpected.Dennehy receives good support from Rosalind Chao as an interpreter he finds himself fancying; Mary Stuart Masterson as his opposing attorney; John Doman as the accused; Debrah Farentino as his distraught wife; and Glenn Plummer as his private investigator.  Only Jason Beghe (Monkey Shines) as the state investigative attorney's performance is listless and not up to his co-stars standards.Well directed by Christopher Leitch, THREE BLIND MICE is an involving little thriller.",4,SEE HOW THEY RUN,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,1018,"['complex', 'coherent', 'script', 'Anne', 'Gerard', 'Adam', 'Greeman', 'based', 'bestselling', 'novelist', 'Ed', 'McBain', 'book', 'THREE', 'BLIND', 'MICE', 'made', 'Tv', 'movie', 'elevated', 'puzzling', 'twists', 'good', 'performance', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Dennehy', 'lawyer', 'who', 'called', 'defend', 'old', 'Vietnam', 'buddy', 'brutal', 'slaying', 'three', 'Vietnamese', 'youths', 'who', 'supposedly', 'attacked', 'wife', 'then', 'were', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'Dennehy', 'investigation', 'coverup', 'hard', 'find', 'real', 'culprit', 'identity', 'pretty', 'unexpected.Dennehy', 'receives', 'good', 'support', 'Rosalind', 'Chao', 'interpreter', 'fancying', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'opposing', 'attorney', 'John', 'Doman', 'accused', 'Debrah', 'Farentino', 'distraught', 'wife', 'Glenn', 'Plummer', 'private', 'investigator', 'Only', 'Jason', 'Beghe', 'Monkey', 'Shines', 'state', 'investigative', 'attorney', 'performance', 'listless', 'not', 'co-stars', 'standards.Well', 'directed', 'Christopher', 'Leitch', 'THREE', 'BLIND', 'MICE', 'involving', 'little', 'thriller']",N/A
