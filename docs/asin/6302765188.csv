They haunt. Who has not had memories ofwanting to free their own symbolic helpless beast,? who,in the trying, has not or will not pay the terrible price,?though hopefully not so terrible as that paid byCotton--the buffalo are the clouds in autumn gray, always.""Lost/stumbling blind/after a dream I just can't find...""from the film can still make me weep, as does the wholesoundtrack, and glad to be able to.Bless Glendon Swarthout forever for his unique boldnovel, and Miles, who was there to tell him. Bless StanleyKramer for making such a superb movie of it, and thatsplendid cast, the lovely music, the sorrowful themeperformed so lovingly, so forlornly, by the Carpenters.One of my cats was named Lally 2 after the character in""Bless the Beasts.."". My Lally had dreams also. I'd like tothink he has now found them come true.Like the boys in the film and novel, he was gentle, and hewas sensitive, and he stayed with me all day long when Iwas so ill.  All those months. Those wise large browneyes, that seemed so concerned, so warm, and the paw healways kept on my wrist as we lay in bed most of the day,like he wanted to be sure he knew I knew he was there.How like the movie and novel he was.It was summer when I read the heartbreaking novel.November when I saw the sometimes sad beyond bearablefilm.

The cost, though, as onecritic wrote, the terrible cost involved.There are some movies that become a pattern of memory,as there are some books. And if one has the hope ofbelieving in something no one else sees as worthwhile, andif one can pass by the portals of fools successfully, youcan follow, and your dream may blow up in your face andit may end in such a sad lesson, but to be pushed in a mudpuddle by bullies, in only your underwear, to be laughedat, and called names, and to have a boy named Cottoncome along and talk with you, and make you feel likesomebody,  and start you on a heroic adventure, thensometimes the terrible wracking cost is worth it. Maybe.Why the movie did not do well at the box office is beyondme. It is prescient right to this second and always will be.Stanley Kramer was known for making epics like""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" another fine film. But this""little movie"" is an epic of the heart. It maintainsSwarthout's free form dream like sometimes causticcharacter studies. It shows how parents caught in boozeand fights and delusion and divorce, can destroy theirchildren. The opening of the film shows this sofrighteningly, so chillingly. And then shows the specificityof each child's nightmare. That turns real.Though ""Lost,"" the most haunting song in the film, hasbeen for some years now the theme song of the soap,which is, I believe, ""The Young and The Restless,"" itdeserves hearing as it should be heard with those achinglyrics, in this movie.It is about the world children and animals secretly see. Itis about the world they see too well, and turn their backson. It is about crying too often, feeling too much, andbeing too scared, or too weak, or too thin, or too fat, ortoo sissy. It is about the depth of deftness and conscience,and how sometimes to free buffalo from monstrousdeaths, is to free something so intangible you never canquite pin it down, which is as it should be, and to try. AndGod forever bless the beasts and children, please ""keepthem safe,"" please ""keep them warm."" They are the mostdeserving of all.

Klinger ""weather nut""","[5, 5]","When I first saw this flawed film in 1971 in the theater at age 30, I so loved it that I decided it was the best movie I eversaw.  Based on the book by Gordon Swarthout, the film is about 6, misfit adolescent boys who sneak away from their cowboysummer camp to try and release buffaloes from a penned location in Arizona where they are killed at close range by&#34;hunters&#34; who drew lottery tickets to thin the herds.  This Government process actually did occur back in those days,and the film includes official &#34;kill&#34; footage.  The movie itself is very emotional and a first class tearjerker.  It is one of onlytwo or three films in my life that actually made me cry profusely two or three times.  But after seeing it repeatedly in thetheatres, and later on VHS, and with more experience cinematically, I can see why it wasn't considered a great film.The 6 boys are largely caricatures, and the film can't decide whether it is a comedy or a drama.  Some scenes arebuffoonish, and other's extremely real and disturbing.  But the climax mixes triumph and tragedy very effectively, whichwas different from the book, and made the ending extremely powerful.  So while I still love the film, I can see why manymay find it too cloying and sentimental, or too realistic in some scenes, while corny or silly in others.

332945,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6302765188,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 5]","Bless the Beasts and Children (Stanley Kramer, 1971)Stanley Kramer was one of the great unheralded directors of the sixties, perhaps because while his better-known contemporaries were churning out movie after movie, Kramer's compositions were brought down off the mountain by Moses every few years or so during his most brilliant period. Still, the sheer number of classic films from his oeuvre, compared to the number of films he directed, is impressive, to say the least. Bless the Beasts and Children is far less seen, and far less heralded, than such films as On the Beach or It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. This is a crime.Based on Glendon Swarthout's excellent novel of the same name (which was assigned reading when I was in sixth grade; my, how the world has changed), Bless the Beasts and Children begins with an unforgettable opening sequence: the six protagonists of the film penned in. The pen is opened, and hunters begin shooting, killing all of them save Cotton (Barry Robins). The hunter targeting him takes off her bandana, and he discovers it's his mother pulling the trigger-- at which point he wakes from his nightmare. Remember, this is the opening scene in the movie; we have no point of reference for these images yet. It is, at this stage in the game, raw image, and raw power. It's obvious from the get-go that Kramer knows what he's doing behind a camera, even if you're not enough of a film buff to have linked his name with his three Oscar nominations for Best Director (for Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?, Judgment at Nuremberg, and The Defiant Ones).The rest of the movie is balanced between providing the context in which to fit the opening scene and giving backstories on the six main characters. While most people remember the score (the Carpenter-crooned title track was nominated for both an Oscar and a Grammy), the acting deserves a great deal of credit here. The kids are excellent, every last one of them. The adults who surround them are all at least of above-average acting quality. This was a quality casting job through and through. They had a solid script to work with (it is somewhat simplified when compared with the book, though that is to be expected with adaptations; also, a faithful adaptation of the book would have garnered an R, at the very least, from the MPAA), and coupled with Kramer's direction and the remarkable cinematography of Michael Hugo (Bob Rafelson's infamous Head is probably his best-known work), the whole package is tremendous.That any Stanley Kramer film has fallen into obscurity is a travesty. That this is one of those that has is even more so. It deserves rediscovery. ****",4,Very powerful.,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,2651,"['Beasts', 'Children', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', '1971', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'unheralded', 'directors', 'sixties', 'perhaps', 'better-known', 'contemporaries', 'were', 'churning', 'out', 'movie', 'movie', 'Kramer', 'compositions', 'were', 'brought', 'down', 'mountain', 'Moses', 'few', 'years', 'so', 'most', 'brilliant', 'period', 'Still', 'sheer', 'number', 'classic', 'films', 'oeuvre', 'compared', 'number', 'films', 'directed', 'impressive', 'say', 'least', 'Bless', 'Beasts', 'Children', 'far', 'less', 'seen', 'far', 'less', 'heralded', 'such', 'films', 'Beach', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', 'crime.Based', 'Glendon', 'Swarthout', 'excellent', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'assigned', 'reading', 'when', 'was', 'sixth', 'grade', 'how', 'world', 'changed', 'Bless', 'Beasts', 'Children', 'unforgettable', 'opening', 'sequence', 'six', 'protagonists', 'film', 'penned', 'pen', 'opened', 'hunters', 'begin', 'shooting', 'killing', 'save', 'Cotton', 'Barry', 'Robins', 'hunter', 'targeting', 'bandana', 'mother', 'pulling', 'trigger', 'point', 'nightmare', 'Remember', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'have', 'point', 'reference', 'images', 'yet', 'stage', 'game', 'raw', 'image', 'raw', 'power', 'obvious', 'get-go', 'Kramer', 'what', 'doing', 'camera', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'enough', 'film', 'buff', 'have', 'linked', 'name', 'three', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Director', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'Defiant', 'Ones', '.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'balanced', 'providing', 'context', 'fit', 'opening', 'scene', 'giving', 'backstories', 'six', 'main', 'characters', 'most', 'people', 'remember', 'score', 'Carpenter-crooned', 'title', 'track', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Grammy', 'acting', 'great', 'deal', 'credit', 'here', 'kids', 'are', 'excellent', 'last', 'one', 'adults', 'who', 'surround', 'are', 'least', 'above-average', 'acting', 'quality', 'was', 'quality', 'casting', 'job', 'had', 'solid', 'script', 'work', 'somewhat', 'simplified', 'when', 'compared', 'book', 'be', 'expected', 'adaptations', 'also', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'garnered', 'R', 'very', 'least', 'MPAA', 'coupled', 'Kramer', 'direction', 'remarkable', 'cinematography', 'Michael', 'Hugo', 'Bob', 'Rafelson', 'infamous', 'Head', 'probably', 'best-known', 'work', 'whole', 'package', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'film', 'fallen', 'obscurity', 'travesty', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'rediscovery', '****']",Bless the Beasts & Children VHS

The first camp I went to was a co-ed camp. Kids ranged from 5  to 18 and were sometimes in a camp-wide group, but more often than not, age  groups and genders were separated. As a group of hyper 5-year-old girls, we  were taught some cheesy crafts, we went fishing, a little archery and  &quot;snipe&quot; hunting. The purpose of snipe (an imaginary creature)  hunting was to supposedly capture a live (never before seen)  specimen.One night we were told the entire camp was going to go on an  Armadillo hunt. I was very excited... I had only seen armadillos on TV and  I really wanted to be able to pet one (and sneak it home in my luggage if I  could!). Little did I realize that some of the older boys had intended on  really hunting one of these harmless creatures... right when I saw one, I  got to see it blown to bits with a shot gun.  There are moments like that  that you never forget... a split second where one small part of you that  was still a child, dies and turns into an adult... all in the twinkling of  an eye.I related to this movie in a million ways. I was one of those  kids that no one noticed and if I had gone missing, no one would have  remembered I was ever there until my parents showed up and asked for me. I  was accustomed to being picked on at school, so I avoided interaction w/  the other kids and always did what I was told by adults... many of whom had  no business being in charge of children.The movie is slow in many  places, but it exacerbates the feeling of lonliness and rejection felt by  the group of outcasts in this film. I was in awe when I saw them stand up  for what they believed in, rejecting authority and doing everything they  could to save what could have very well been the last herd of buffalo on  earth. They finally say, &quot;no more! We're tired of crying, and now  we're going to fight!&quot;A few funny moments, but those are there to  break the tension... many poignant moments, boys confiding in their friends  their deepest fears and longings... and there are the senseless tragic  moments.Even as a child, I was keenly aware from watching the news how  endangered buffalo were at the time. While they're so common today as to be  served up as alternative beef, when this movie was released there were less  than 2,000 living specimens. This film must have certainly inspired a more  fervent effort to increase their numbers.Excellent performances by Billy  Mumy, Barry Robins, Miles Chapin and others... not to mention the title  song performed by The Carpenters. While I saw this film as a child and I  survived the experience, I don't recommend this film for young children.  The violence perpetrated against the animals in the film will be extremely  upsetting to anyone, but especially to little kids... and some young  children may find the film to be too slow to pay attention to at  length.If you haven't seen this film, it is a classic and abounding with  great talent in these wise-beyond-their-years characters.",5,moving &amp; tragic 70's tear jerker,964051200,"07 20, 2000",2000,3148,"['first', 'started', 'going', 'camp', 'when', 'was', '5', 'years', 'old', 'just', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'first', 'camp', 'went', 'was', 'co-ed', 'camp', 'Kids', 'ranged', '5', '18', 'were', 'sometimes', 'camp-wide', 'group', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'age', 'groups', 'genders', 'were', 'separated', 'group', 'hyper', '5-year-old', 'girls', 'were', 'taught', 'cheesy', 'crafts', 'went', 'fishing', 'little', 'archery', 'quot', 'quot', 'hunting', 'purpose', 'snipe', 'imaginary', 'creature', 'hunting', 'was', 'supposedly', 'capture', 'live', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'specimen.One', 'night', 'were', 'told', 'entire', 'camp', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'Armadillo', 'hunt', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'armadillos', 'TV', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'able', 'pet', 'one', 'sneak', 'home', 'luggage', 'could', 'Little', 'did', 'realize', 'older', 'boys', 'had', 'intended', 'really', 'hunting', 'one', 'harmless', 'creatures', 'right', 'when', 'saw', 'one', 'got', 'see', 'blown', 'bits', 'shot', 'gun', 'are', 'moments', 'never', 'forget', 'split', 'second', 'where', 'one', 'small', 'part', 'was', 'still', 'child', 'dies', 'adult', 'twinkling', 'eye.I', 'related', 'movie', 'million', 'ways', 'was', 'one', 'kids', 'one', 'noticed', 'had', 'gone', 'missing', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'remembered', 'was', 'ever', 'there', 'parents', 'showed', 'up', 'asked', 'was', 'accustomed', 'being', 'picked', 'school', 'avoided', 'interaction', 'other', 'kids', 'always', 'did', 'what', 'was', 'told', 'adults', 'many', 'whom', 'had', 'business', 'being', 'charge', 'children.The', 'movie', 'slow', 'many', 'places', 'feeling', 'lonliness', 'rejection', 'felt', 'group', 'outcasts', 'film', 'was', 'awe', 'when', 'saw', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'believed', 'rejecting', 'authority', 'doing', 'everything', 'could', 'save', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'well', 'been', 'last', 'herd', 'buffalo', 'earth', 'finally', 'say', 'quot', 'more', ""'re"", 'tired', 'crying', 'now', ""'re"", 'going', 'fight', 'quot', 'A', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'there', 'break', 'tension', 'many', 'poignant', 'moments', 'boys', 'confiding', 'friends', 'deepest', 'fears', 'longings', 'are', 'senseless', 'tragic', 'moments.Even', 'child', 'was', 'keenly', 'aware', 'watching', 'news', 'how', 'endangered', 'buffalo', 'were', 'time', ""'re"", 'so', 'common', 'today', 'be', 'served', 'up', 'alternative', 'beef', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'were', 'less', '2,000', 'living', 'specimens', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'certainly', 'inspired', 'more', 'fervent', 'effort', 'increase', 'numbers.Excellent', 'performances', 'Billy', 'Mumy', 'Barry', 'Robins', 'Miles', 'Chapin', 'others', 'not', 'mention', 'title', 'song', 'performed', 'Carpenters', 'saw', 'film', 'child', 'survived', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'young', 'children', 'violence', 'perpetrated', 'animals', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'extremely', 'upsetting', 'anyone', 'especially', 'little', 'kids', 'young', 'children', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'too', 'slow', 'pay', 'attention', 'length.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'classic', 'abounding', 'great', 'talent', 'wise-beyond-their-years', 'characters']",Bless the Beasts & Children VHS

It was hot and the mosquitoes down here in Florida will eat you alive if you didn't have a few of those burning incense-like repellent things on your dashboard.It was that mood of smell and feeling that I watched the redneck counselor of the misfit cabin try to make ""men"" out of the boys who actually had hearts and souls. If that counselor had any brains himself he would have known that his treatment of the boys would have just pushed them together.Add the slaughter of the buffalo and you have a catalyst for a story of how the misfits could strike back at their heartless world and bond with those buffalo whom they felt were also misfits. In the end the leader of the misfits suffered the same fate as the buffalo proving that people that don't fit in won't be treated any better than a dumb beast if they fight ""normality"".Everyone wants to pick on Bill Mumy and talk about the long-haired, cigarette smoking, car stealing character he played in Bless the Beasts but let's face it; Lost in Space had been over for years and Will Robinson was just a character like any other and Dr. Smith was no where in sight. It was time for a change and since that time Mumy has played many other characters including a recurring role on Babylon 5.The one thing no one mentions on any of these reviews is The Carpenters haunting theme song that even to this day can bring a tear to my eye as I think of the misfit slumped over the steering wheel of that Dodge power wagon with a bullet through his brain as the camera pulls back to show the look on the counselor's face when he realizes that he killed a human being and then a high shot of the buffalo pen as the other misfits run toward their dead friend, Cotton.Karen Carpenter's voice fades:""Bless the beasts....and the children......(softer) bless the beasts.....and the children.....(even softer)......bless the beasts and the children.....""(Fade to black)I dare any of you with a heart who ever really watched the movie and understood it to remember the ending and not shed a tear because don't we all feel like misfits sometimes?",5,Tears for the buffalo and the misfits,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,2142,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', '16', 'years-old', 'drive-in', 'movie', 'was', 'hot', 'mosquitoes', 'down', 'here', 'Florida', 'will', 'eat', 'alive', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'few', 'burning', 'incense-like', 'repellent', 'things', 'dashboard.It', 'was', 'mood', 'smell', 'feeling', 'watched', 'redneck', 'counselor', 'misfit', 'cabin', 'try', 'make', 'men', 'boys', 'who', 'actually', 'had', 'hearts', 'souls', 'counselor', 'had', 'brains', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'treatment', 'boys', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'pushed', 'together.Add', 'slaughter', 'buffalo', 'have', 'catalyst', 'story', 'how', 'misfits', 'could', 'strike', 'back', 'heartless', 'world', 'bond', 'buffalo', 'whom', 'felt', 'were', 'also', 'misfits', 'end', 'leader', 'misfits', 'suffered', 'same', 'fate', 'buffalo', 'proving', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'treated', 'better', 'dumb', 'beast', 'fight', 'normality', '.Everyone', 'pick', 'Bill', 'Mumy', 'talk', 'long-haired', 'cigarette', 'smoking', 'car', 'stealing', 'character', 'played', 'Bless', 'Beasts', 'let', 'face', 'Lost', 'Space', 'had', 'been', 'years', 'Will', 'Robinson', 'was', 'just', 'character', 'other', 'Dr.', 'Smith', 'was', 'where', 'sight', 'was', 'time', 'change', 'time', 'Mumy', 'played', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'including', 'recurring', 'role', 'Babylon', '5.The', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'mentions', 'reviews', 'Carpenters', 'haunting', 'theme', 'song', 'even', 'day', 'can', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye', 'think', 'misfit', 'slumped', 'steering', 'wheel', 'Dodge', 'power', 'wagon', 'bullet', 'brain', 'camera', 'back', 'show', 'look', 'counselor', 'face', 'when', 'killed', 'human', 'being', 'then', 'high', 'shot', 'buffalo', 'pen', 'other', 'misfits', 'run', 'dead', 'friend', 'Cotton.Karen', 'Carpenter', 'voice', 'fades', 'beasts', '.and', 'children', 'softer', 'beasts', '..and', 'children', '..', 'even', 'softer', 'beasts', 'children', '..', 'Fade', 'black', 'dare', 'heart', 'who', 'ever', 'really', 'watched', 'movie', 'understood', 'remember', 'ending', 'not', 'shed', 'tear', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'misfits', 'sometimes']",Bless the Beasts & Children VHS
