Jenna does a good job in explaining certain moves, now its a matter of practice on my side to perfection the shimmy. I liked the warm up alot , it loosened up my hips and shoulders in preparation for other practices. I found the section that teaches drum rythms to be very insightful. I was pleasently surprised that i began to sweat in the section of shimmy drills.!!! Wow...its not easy. But i had a real problem with the quality of the video and in some parts the editing is poorly  done. I dont know much about belly dancing but i feel this dvd probably  doesnt cover enough...so ill have to buy several others and see if there are other moves or techniques to learn. I've realized though, with drum solos, its not easy to try and do a choreography that jenna teaches. because i tend to move to the drum in my own ways so...that is a bit challenging.",4,very good...but poor video quality and editing.,1188950400,"09 5, 2007",2007,975,"['first', 'dvd', 'belly', 'dancing', 'bit', 'hard', 'say', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'really', 'i', 'was', 'pretty', 'satisfied', 'Jenna', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'certain', 'moves', 'now', 'matter', 'practice', 'side', 'perfection', 'shimmy', 'liked', 'warm', 'up', 'alot', 'loosened', 'up', 'hips', 'shoulders', 'preparation', 'other', 'practices', 'found', 'section', 'drum', 'rythms', 'be', 'very', 'insightful', 'was', 'pleasently', 'surprised', 'i', 'began', 'sweat', 'section', 'shimmy', 'drills.', 'Wow', 'not', 'easy', 'i', 'had', 'real', 'problem', 'quality', 'video', 'parts', 'editing', 'poorly', 'done', 'dont', 'know', 'much', 'belly', 'dancing', 'i', 'feel', 'dvd', 'probably', 'cover', 'enough', 'so', 'ill', 'have', 'buy', 'several', 'others', 'see', 'are', 'other', 'moves', 'techniques', 'learn', ""'ve"", 'realized', 'drum', 'solos', 'not', 'easy', 'try', 'do', 'choreography', 'jenna', 'teaches', 'i', 'tend', 'move', 'drum', 'own', 'ways', 'so', 'bit', 'challenging']","The Heartbeat of Bellydance, with Jenna: Belly dance classes, Belly dance instruction with drum solo, Drum solo dance how-to"

Arthur ""calendria""","[0, 0]","Okay, this is an awesome dvd.It has a warm up section, rhythm work on knowing different kinds of beats and different moves to do to them. then there is a choreography section where you can see the performance, see it practiced, see the moves being broken down, and then learning the choreography.there is a performance section where Jenna performs all 3 drum solos plus 6 minute bonus improv. Very nice.My glitch:On drum solo 3, she goes forward and backward in learning the choreography and there was this one move (you're turning in a 3/4 circle by moving your feet very tiny, and moving your hands from your back to your front, and she never breaks it down). It was soooooo frustrating and she never explains it, but I eventually learned it.my 2end minor glitch, is that there isn't a button or a function to practice all 3 drum solos back to back. oh well.I am still learning, months later, more about drums and beats and how to dance to them. It seems very simple but the complexities are vast for what you learn, if you just take the time.oh and I forgot, the 2 shimmy drills. One is a 8-9 minute shimmy layering drill. Then there is a 3 minute 3/4 shimmy drill. Doing both will give you a nice sweat and some quad burn, lol.Most definitely worth the price.",4,Awesome dvd with one glitch,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,1263,"['Okay', 'awesome', 'dvd.It', 'warm', 'up', 'section', 'rhythm', 'work', 'knowing', 'different', 'kinds', 'beats', 'different', 'moves', 'do', 'then', 'choreography', 'section', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'performance', 'see', 'practiced', 'see', 'moves', 'being', 'broken', 'down', 'then', 'learning', 'choreography.there', 'performance', 'section', 'where', 'Jenna', '3', 'drum', 'solos', '6', 'minute', 'bonus', 'improv', 'Very', 'nice.My', 'glitch', 'drum', 'solo', '3', 'forward', 'backward', 'learning', 'choreography', 'was', 'one', 'move', ""'re"", 'turning', '3/4', 'circle', 'moving', 'feet', 'very', 'tiny', 'moving', 'hands', 'back', 'front', 'never', 'down', 'was', 'soooooo', 'frustrating', 'never', 'eventually', 'learned', 'it.my', '2end', 'minor', 'glitch', ""n't"", 'button', 'function', 'practice', '3', 'drum', 'solos', 'back', 'back', 'oh', 'well.I', 'am', 'still', 'learning', 'months', 'later', 'more', 'drums', 'beats', 'how', 'dance', 'very', 'simple', 'complexities', 'are', 'vast', 'what', 'learn', 'just', 'take', 'time.oh', 'forgot', '2', 'shimmy', 'drills', 'One', '8-9', 'minute', 'shimmy', 'layering', 'drill', 'Then', '3', 'minute', '3/4', 'shimmy', 'drill', 'Doing', 'will', 'give', 'nice', 'sweat', 'quad', 'burn', 'lol.Most', 'definitely', 'price']","The Heartbeat of Bellydance, with Jenna: Belly dance classes, Belly dance instruction with drum solo, Drum solo dance how-to"

918794,AVPM4HFPBHGFK,B000A2ASN2,Deborah P,"[10, 11]","This is a BEGINNER-to-INTERMEDIATE BELLY DANCE DVD ANDON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10......WHAT TO DO (STEPS)--10You can see exactly what she's doing from head to toe. She counts the beats out for you....TECHNIQUE (HOW TO DO IT) --5She explains fully WHAT she's doing as she does it but not always how to get a combination of moves to work together. Practicing it several times in a row might help but she doesn't do that....PRACTICE TIME--2Practice is practically nil. And the editing is poor. There are only two repeats per a series of steps in the ""learning sections"" And the second time through a series starts before you know what's happening--even when you're expecting this to happen....SENSUALITY--6Technically, she is very proficient, but there's not a lot of feeling to her dancing....BANG FOR THE BUCK--9There are three choreographies. Very beginner to Intermediate but the last one is ""taught"" in fragments rather than gone through from beginning to end with the student. And there is a section which speaks to the different types of rhythms (And dancers who truly learn to enjoy belly dancing will eventually want to know this)...DVD TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS--2I can't really say enough about how abrupt and disconcerting the editing is. Other belly dance DVDs either have you practice in such a way that you know when the series of steps is repeating with a significant pause between each practice OR there is a transition step between each repeat.Being able to see all of her, both front and back, constantly has an up side and a down side. Being able to see everything you can definitely learn how to do the moves so long as you keep the remote in your hand constantly. (There aren't many repeats at all) However, I find I like having the camera direct my attention to what I need at any given moment--with intermittent full body shots so I can see exactly what she's doing as I get more familiar with the routine. As it stands, when you're just starting with this DVD, in order to keep your left and right straight, you need to decide which image you're going to look at--her or her image in the mirror.**In the end, I'd say this is a choreography DVD. Precise Technique is verbally explained and demonstrated but not ""taught.""

918795,A29UATAQB4AV3Q,B000A2ASN2,"desertdancer ""desertdancer""","[9, 10]","It's been a while since I've been really delighted with a belly dance DVD. This DVD is something special, though! I've been listening to a great Arabic radio station (thank heaven for TiVo!) and was looking for something that would explain Arabic rhythms. The information Raquy presents is enough to justify the cost of this DVD alone!But there's more to love. Jenna is an excellent instructor *for the late beginner-early intermediate* student. She assumes knowledge of many belly dance steps. As an intermediate student myself, I found this DVD just right. The first two choreos were easy and gave me an opportunity to get accustomed to dancing while paying attention to the rhythms. The third was a bit more challenging -- but fun! As a side note, I loved how Jenna carefully broke down transition steps.Jenna herself is marvelous. Her stage presence is amazing, and her dancing is naturally sensuous. I adore Veena and Neena, but they should take a lesson from Jenna, and put on a few pounds! Jenna's belly jiggles a bit when she shimmies, and she has *hips*! Woo-hoo! For those of us with a *real* woman's body, Jenna is a welcome respite from skinny-mini belly dancers.I have just one itty-bitty critique -- I'd have preferred if Jenna did the choreo breakdown in pants that weren't so long. It was hard to see at times if she was on tiptoe or flat-footed.Otherwise, this is an absolute must-have DVD. I really wish I'd found this DVD much, much sooner. I wouldn't have been able to follow Jenna until I'd been dancing for a while (I'm a painfully slow learner), but I wish I'd known more about Arabic rhythms when I first began studying belly dance.

918796,A21BJRAY0I5WM9,B000A2ASN2,Eden Russell,"[23, 24]","I'm a beginner and I've never received face-to-face instruction even though I attend bellydancing-style workouts for beginners. This is why I was taken a little aback when I first watched the DVD, especially Jenna's performances.If you've never ever bellydanced before, you'll need another set of instructions to start with first. I saw that Jenna is making a new DVD (basics and beyond) and I suppose that she will give more detailed explanation in it. I'd say this very DVD is at intermidiate level even though beginners will find it useful just like advanced dancers.I've read the reviews for almost all DVDs available on amazon and I noticed that usually beginners give high ratings and more advanced dancers are very critical. It seems to me that everyone agrees it's a wonderful DVD and I find very indicative of its quality.I have to point that in order to learn the moves well, it's necessary to use a mirror especially if you're not experienced/well familiar with these moves. It's easy enough to follow Jenna along but when I cast a glance at the mirror, more often than not I realize they look very little like Jenna's. This is especially true about the hip accents.PROS of this DVD:1. It's long and inclusive. It has a warmup, drills to improve technique/ train muscles, a section divided into three groups - at beginning, intermidiate and advanced level. The rhythm workshop is great for learning drum solo rhythms and their interpretations. There are several seperate performances. It's 85 mins. It's great value for your money.2. JENNA is an example of what a dancer should look like. Her dancing is very refined, she movements - very delicate. She's an example of what it is like to blend mastery with grace. Most of the dancers I'm watched tend to do exaggerated and jerky movements which is very much unlike her and yet her dancing looks just as good, if not better.3. What I love about it is that it suggests three full choreographies and I got the sense of completion with that.4. I'm very happy with the shimmy drills. They are a wonderful workout and they also gave me the chance to watch Jenna shimmy for a long time. It made me think ""oh maybe I'll be able to do it like that some day"".5. Jenna is dancing in front of a mirror. Even though I have a few remarks about that, it's a fairly good idea.6. Jenna has a good attitude as an instruction. I dislike the fake smiles that so many professional dancers have like *plastered* on their faces (like Neena and Veena). Her dancing is inspiring in the way that it makes you feeling bellydancing is fun and enjoyable.7. The DVD is organized in nice short segments that you can watch and rewind as many times as you want to fit your needs. You can do it again and again and again. Probably at least 6 months worth of practice is packed up in this DVD.8. Her performances in the seperate section are quite inspiring. I'm sure advanced, maybe even professional dancers would find them interesting and useful.9. What I love about this DVD is the traditional dancing. I also got Neon's Crash Course DVD and I was disappointed to hear music you could listen to in nightclubs. There are ONLY typical mid-easterns rhythms included, no fusion.CONS of the DVD:1. As a beginner, I was taken aback the first time I saw this DVD. It's very hard at first and Jenna does not give very detailed instructions (what a person who's never bellydanced before would need). However, I think more advanced dancers would enjoy this approach and find too much explanation boring.2. I saw that someone else complained about not being able to see her feet (if she's on tiptoe or not). I had the same problem. My bigger problem was that Jenna is facing the mirror, not the camera and it's much harder for me to learn watching the back. If I need to watch what she does with her belly I have to stop dancing and stare (I have a small screen). I'm happy that when she performs it's the other way round, so I can get a better idea of how she does things.To sum everything up, I would recommend this DVD to everybody.

Jenna is encouraging without talking down to the viewer or being repetative.  I loved the shimmy layering drills and will get a lot of practice to clean up my technique, the REALLY simplified way that Raquy teaches how to identify different rhythms (an A-HA moment here!), the different levels of drum solo work, with the additional improvisational drum solo (or duet as they like to say) That is very inspirational.  The warmup is a good basic one that gets the job done without being tedious.

They're supposed to be beginner, intermediate, advanced/expert. Each of these is broken up into 4 segments - performance (done by the instructor in front of an audience), tutorial (step-by-step of each move), learn & practice (loops it 2x, so you can practice) and finally one where you do it in full.The tutorials are all done in a studio in front of a wall-to-wall mirror with a view of the front and back of the instructor, so you do not miss anything. There are even close-ups of the footwork, at the end of some of the more complicated movements. Another great thing is that there is a little countdown marker at the bottom left of the screen, while the instructor counts it out loud as well.The tutorials are done at a good pace - slow/explanatory, perform it once or twice. When you move on to the next movement, it gives you detailed instructions on how to segue smoothly from one move to the other.Rhythm Workshop - Raquy, the percussionist, explains a little about the music. How you can pick up what type of rhythm or style it is just from listening to it. There's also a tutorial and performance by the instructor, Jenna, in how to dance to the drum (and the drummer).Shimmy Drills - Shimmy Layering Drills, 3/4 Shimmy Drill. These are pretty amazing and it'll really make you work on those shimmies.Performance, Music etc. which are typical of most bellydancing DVDs.What I especially liked was how well organized the DVD was. It was easy for you to skip between movements in the tutorial (Choreography Workshop - #2) .. from move #1 to move #2, which may not be a big thing but for repeated viewings or practices this would be advantageous.Again, I highly recommend this DVD.

This DVD is difficult enough to keep me from getting bored, but not so difficult that I can't learn.  Wonderful organization of the DVD, easy menus, great production quality and lighting.Hope Jenna & Raquy produce something else soon!",5,Great DVD !!!,1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,370,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'dancing', '1996', 'yet', 'attempt', 'drum', 'solo', 'too', 'fast', 'too', 'complicated', 'Jenna', 'down', 'easy', 'pickup', 'DVD', 'difficult', 'enough', 'keep', 'getting', 'bored', 'not', 'so', 'difficult', 'ca', ""n't"", 'learn', 'Wonderful', 'organization', 'DVD', 'easy', 'menus', 'great', 'production', 'quality', 'lighting.Hope', 'Jenna', 'Raquy', 'produce', 'something', 'else', 'soon']","The Heartbeat of Bellydance, with Jenna: Belly dance classes, Belly dance instruction with drum solo, Drum solo dance how-to"
