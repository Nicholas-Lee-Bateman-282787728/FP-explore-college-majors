1204432,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B001ILFUAA,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[1, 3]","I'm still debating on whether I should get this DVD or not.I mean I have seen almost every episode of the first season so far because although I was introduced to the show on it's 5th episode, I went back to see the first episodes at abc family's website and have been enjoying them ever since.This show is fantastic. It's dramatic, most of the characters are great and the plot generally moves along smoothly. The best part, or at least my favorite part of the show is the interweaving relationships that the teens have.I mean Jack has relations with Adrian who is seeing Ricky who kisses Grace AND Lauren (at different times) who is friends with Amy who got pregnant by Ricky. It's a big web and continues on forever.It's kinda sad sometimes, it's comical sometimes and a few things in between.It comes on ABC Family at 8 Eastern time and shouldn't be missed.Aimed at anyone who is interested in seeing the lives of teenagers in high school get mixed up in drama. Even their parents get in on it sometimes.Favorite characters in order: level-headed Lauryn, one of Amy's best friends, Adrian, Ricky's bed buddy and Ashley, Amy's smartalic kid sister.4.5 stars.",4,A wonderful addition to tv in a sea of stupid reality shows.,1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,1161,"[""'m"", 'still', 'debating', 'should', 'get', 'DVD', 'not.I', 'mean', 'have', 'seen', 'almost', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'introduced', 'show', '5th', 'episode', 'went', 'back', 'see', 'first', 'episodes', 'abc', 'family', 'website', 'have', 'been', 'enjoying', 'ever', 'since.This', 'show', 'fantastic', 'dramatic', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'plot', 'generally', 'along', 'smoothly', 'best', 'part', 'least', 'favorite', 'part', 'show', 'interweaving', 'relationships', 'teens', 'have.I', 'mean', 'Jack', 'relations', 'Adrian', 'who', 'seeing', 'Ricky', 'who', 'Grace', 'AND', 'Lauren', 'different', 'times', 'who', 'friends', 'Amy', 'who', 'got', 'pregnant', 'Ricky', 'big', 'web', 'forever.It', 'kinda', 'sad', 'sometimes', 'comical', 'sometimes', 'few', 'things', 'between.It', 'ABC', 'Family', '8', 'Eastern', 'time', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed.Aimed', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'seeing', 'lives', 'teenagers', 'high', 'school', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'drama', 'Even', 'parents', 'get', 'sometimes.Favorite', 'characters', 'order', 'level-headed', 'Lauryn', 'one', 'Amy', 'best', 'friends', 'Adrian', 'Ricky', 'bed', 'buddy', 'Ashley', 'Amy', 'smartalic', 'kid', 'sister.4.5', 'stars']",N/A

All this stuff about the show not being realistic just shows how much we NEED more shows like this.  What do I mean by that?  SECRET LIFE was created by the same people behind SEVENTH HEAVEN, another series strongly rooted in Christian values that was attacked for that very reason.Which is not to say that all the show's characters have strong faiths.  Not at all.  But what bugs me is that when teens are depicted as--gasp!--having values and NOT constantly rebelling against their parents, people see that as unrealistic.

1204438,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001ILFUAA,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[8, 14]","The ABC Family series ""THE SECRET LIFE OF THE AMERICAN TEENAGER"" has definitely caught a lot of attention and eventually becoming ABC Family's top rated show.Whereas the film ""JUNO"" was a popular film about teenage pregnancy, fortunately for ""THE SECRET LIFE OF THE AMERICAN TEENAGER"", the series goes much more in depth of the one night stand, ramifications of being pregnant at a young age and the fact that sex is in the minds of many young teenagers and how some can practice abstinence and some find it very hard to do just that.The series primarily focuses on the life of Amy Juergens (Shailene Woodley).  Your typical girl next door.  A 15-year-old who plays the French Horn in a band and part of a typical American family ala dysfunctional. She is devastated to find out that she is pregnant and doesn't know what to do, doesn't know how to explain it to her family and doesn't know if she can have a baby.Meanwhile, her mother Anne (Molly Ringwald) is worried about her dad, George (Mark Derwin).  George seems to be going on these business trips but in reality is having an affair.  Amy has a 13-year-old sister named Ashley who is very rebellious.But things have changed for Amy at band camp when she had sex with playboy drummer, Rickey.  Although it lasted only seconds, it was enough to get her pregnant and now she must face the inevitable.  Being 15-years-old and now pregnant.But the series also has other teenagers at Ulysses S. Grant High School who have their own sort of problems.  The others who have their own storyline in the series are:Benjamin ""Ben"" Boykewich (Kenny Baumann) - A teenager who is Amy's boyfriend and will do anything for her.  His father is ""the sausage king"" and his mother died several years ago.  He offers to marry Amy.  He has never been in a relationship before, thus sometimes he says things in the wrong moment.  Although close to his father, when it comes to how he should approach his relationship with Amy, he listens to his best friends Henry and Alice and when times get tough, he seeks out the help from the school guidance counselor, Marc Molina (Jorge Pallo).Rickey Underwood (Darren Kagasoff) - Rickey is the father of Amy's baby.  He is the drummer in the band, very manipulative and a player.  His ""bed buddy"" is Adrian but his goal is to have sex with devoted Christian, Grace Bowman.  Rickey also is seeking therapy through Dr. Ken Fields (Ernie Hudson) due to being molested by his father when he was young and being bounced around in several foster homes.Adrian Lee (Francia Raisa) - Very intelligent but somehow strayed in the wrong path and is a flirt who engages in sex with different guys.  She is a majorette and always wonders who her real father is.  She sleeps with Rickey and believes that a bad girl deserves a bad boy like him.  She has slept with Grace Bowman's boyfriend Jack.Grace Kathleen Bowman (Megan Park) - A devoted Christian and cheerleader who dates star football player Jack.  She doesn't want to have sex until she gets married and wears a promise ring. Life changes for Grace when she catches Jack and Adrian kissing and then starts to have a friendship with Rickey, who she thinks is a good guy at heart.Jack Pappas (Greg Finley II) - A football player who can't get his mind off sex.  He's a son of the pastor but wants to have sex with Grace but because of her strict parents and devotion to her Christian faith, Jack ends up having sex with Adrian.  Now having lost Grace, he wants her back.Madison Cooperstein (Renee Olstead) and Lauren Treacy (Camille Winbush) are Amy's best friends.  They are the only one's that know that she is pregnant but at the same time, they are quite talkative and word starts to get around the school.Henry Miller (Allen Evangelista) and Alice Valko (Amy Rider) are a romantic couple and friends of Ben.  Henry wants to have sex with Alice and Alice wants to wait.  Alice is very smart and always spouting statistics.I was actually quite amazed with ""THE SECRET LIFE OF THE AMERICAN TEENAGER"".  Compared to a lot of the teen dramas out on television right now, I found this series to be heartwarming, endearing and fantastic.The character development was well-done and you actually like these characters.  From the high school students to the parents and the school guidance counselor, everyone does a super job in their roles.  And again, the stories are well-written and the pacing is well done.Now, what problems did I have with the series?  There were a few minor quibbles that made me want to pull out my hair.  In one episode, Amy's best friends start fighting and challenging each other in who can get closer to Rickey (yes, the player and the person that got their best friend pregnant).  Every episode was well-done but this episode was a bit far-fetched.Sure, Rickey is a manipulative player that seems to hook these young teenagers to fighting for him, having sex with him or having interest in him but to see the Amy's best friends having a squabble over him and who can get closer to him was just a bit over-the-top.  But outside of that, every episode is well done.  The cast was well-selected and by the end of the series, even the parents start to get their own storyline as well. And play a major part not necessarily taking away anything from the teenagers storylines but showing that the parents play an important role in the life of a teenager.And for some teenagers, life at home is not always happy.For a character like Amy, who is pregnant and now having to deal with her parents separating is just a double whammy but we know in reality, high school life is complicated and unfortunate things do happen.  Ben still has a hard time dealing with his mother's death, Rickey has a problem dealing with authority figures because he was betrayed by his own father and kicked out of so many foster homes, Grace's parents are just strict because they want their children to be Christian and make sound decisions and Adrian has a mother who is never home because she's an airline stewardess and thus, doesn't have a parent at home when she needs them and thus acts out.The series is critically acclaimed and has done well against other competing teenage drama series and I can understand why.  These characters are a good representation of people who you may know at high school and the parents and teenager relationships (or lack of it), also happens in reality.So, the fact that this type of series is on television is special.  ""THE SECRET LIFE OF THE AMERICAN TEENAGER"" is a wonderful, heartwarming series that is well-written, well-acted and definitely worth watching and owning on DVD!",4,"This is not an after school

However, all-too-often, the secondary characters come off as cartoonish because of exaggerated behavior or responses, rather than as real people.  Molly Ringwald steps in the Mom's role but the writing for her character is flat and creates a somewhat whiny role for her. The biggest problems however, are the handling of the central issue of the pregnancy and the prevalence of teen sex.  The age group depicted (15 year olds) is unlikely the age group watching (pre-teens are probably the must see audience).  I'd hoped to find family viewing but all too often, even my teens and pre-teens were amazed at the over-the-top writing and situations.  So why three stars?

A 15 year old gets pregnant the first time she has sex and the show does not hold back.  It really shows what being a teenage mother is like.  The fears, feeling trapped, staying home while your friends are going to the prom, ballgames, dating, etc. Her parents have made it loud and clear that they are not raising this baby for her. It is sad. Molly Ringwald plays her Mom but I think her acting is terrible.  She was much better during her teenage years but the other actors make up for her poor acting.

Can you believe that this show is on a FAMILY channel?This show is NOTHING but a sex show, as EVERYTHING IS ABOUT SEX and revolves around it. It makes Sex and the City look tame. I was so shocked and disgusted. The characters play musical chairs with their lovers, and they aren't even LEGAL yet. I don't know about you, but I was a teenager only a couple of years ago and I knew very few people like this. We had a word for them and it certainly didn't include the words ""American teenager."" Even if some were sexually active, they were not this sexually active to the point of sleeping with a friend's ex-boyfriend, and their parents knowing about their activities.This show portrays American teenagers in a horribly negative light, showcasing them as sex crazed and overly promiscuous people. I am ashamed that a show like this was able to be made, shown and promoted for young people to watch. Not to forget that the actors CANNOT act. How have Mayim Bialik aka Blossom and Molly Ringwald, two GOOD actresses, been reduced to star in this hack of a show?I am in NO WAYS a prude, but having a show like this depicting and glorifying all types of sexual activity for teenagers is degrading. While the show does promote safe sex, a BETTER idea is to promote ABSTINENCE and NOT sleeping around with everyone. The show runs like a soap opera where everyone was at one time or another involved with every other character. There are all the elements of a trashy soap opera in it, with the exception that most of the major characters are in their teens and still in high school.STAY AWAY!",1,"What a sad, sad show!",1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,1671,"['watched', 'few', 'episodes', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'marathon', 'running', 'ABC', 'family', 'Can', 'believe', 'show', 'FAMILY', 'channel', 'show', 'NOTHING', 'sex', 'show', 'EVERYTHING', 'ABOUT', 'SEX', 'Sex', 'City', 'look', 'tame', 'was', 'so', 'shocked', 'disgusted', 'characters', 'play', 'musical', 'chairs', 'lovers', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'LEGAL', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'teenager', 'only', 'couple', 'years', 'knew', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'had', 'word', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'words', 'American', 'teenager', 'Even', 'were', 'sexually', 'active', 'were', 'not', 'sexually', 'active', 'point', 'sleeping', 'friend', 'ex-boyfriend', 'parents', 'knowing', 'activities.This', 'show', 'American', 'teenagers', 'horribly', 'negative', 'light', 'showcasing', 'sex', 'crazed', 'overly', 'promiscuous', 'people', 'am', 'ashamed', 'show', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'made', 'shown', 'promoted', 'young', 'people', 'watch', 'Not', 'forget', 'actors', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'act', 'How', 'have', 'Mayim', 'Bialik', 'aka', 'Blossom', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'two', 'GOOD', 'actresses', 'been', 'reduced', 'star', 'hack', 'show', 'am', 'NO', 'WAYS', 'prude', 'having', 'show', 'depicting', 'glorifying', 'types', 'sexual', 'activity', 'teenagers', 'degrading', 'show', 'promote', 'safe', 'sex', 'BETTER', 'idea', 'promote', 'ABSTINENCE', 'NOT', 'sleeping', 'around', 'everyone', 'show', 'soap', 'opera', 'where', 'everyone', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'involved', 'other', 'character', 'are', 'elements', 'trashy', 'soap', 'opera', 'exception', 'most', 'major', 'characters', 'are', 'teens', 'still', 'high', 'school.STAY', 'AWAY']",N/A

1204452,AA963ZRLZFOCO,B001ILFUAA,Supershopper,"[2, 4]","I keep waiting for great messages for teens in this series, but I have really only found one - most all teens are having sex.  The most commonly heard words in EVERY EPISODE (over and over) are either ""having sex"" ""have sex"" ""has sex"" or ""had sex"".  I've lost count.  That pretty much sums up the show.  If I had a teen, I would NOT want them watching it as they show so much casual sex, especially with the character Adrian.  They show a girl who is very religious and makes the statement she will not have sex till she is married after she graduates from medical school, but soon after she has sex with her boyfriend.  They all give in eventually, not a great way to set an example for teens.  The one time they broach the subject of m********ion as a way to say to heck with sex the boys, ""we'll take care of things"", they show how quickly that solution wore off...It's basically a soap - if you like daytime soaps where very little happens, things are unrealistic AND they grow up newborns by 9-12 months within one episode (after just being born 3 or so eps ago) just like the soaps do, something I HATE, you will like this show!!  It reminds you of how unrealistic the whole thing is.  Also, how about SHOWING the fake birth scene?  They completely cut that out...the baby just appears in the mother's arms after a break.Other things that bother me:  Stop walking around with your hands on your belly while you are pregnant - people don't do this in real life!!  Show the babies more and what's it's like taking care of them - as in soaps, they are just carried around here and there.  Maybe I'm too used to seeing 16 and Pregnant/Teen Mom which is a more realistic look at teen pregnancy.  The acting of some of the adults especially Molly Ringwald is pretty bad (but the kids are all good actors).  Why would they pick her for this role?  Why was she ever picked for ANY role in acting?  She just recites lines with no emotion.  She looks terrible through much of it while she is pregnant - overweight and bloated and her voice is awful - hard to watch.  I know she was PG with twins in real life, but it was pretty sad to have to watch her.The only things that keep me watching:  the look and feel of the show are very pretty - the colors and decoration of the sets, great lighting inside and out and they film exteriors at the Warner Bros Ranch in Burbank one of my favorite places to see shows done at.  It is home to some of the great old shows such as Bewitched, Gidget, The Partridge Family, Father Knows Best, The Donna Reed Show, Dennis the Menace, Hazel, I Dream of Jeannie, The Flying Nun, The Monkees, and many other shows and movies.  They use pretty tight shots so you can't see some of the most recognizable houses, but you can see enough to know where they are.  The homes they ""live"" in are 2 houses to the left of the ""Bewitched house"" and down to the corner.  I also like some of the characters - I like Ashley's morose personality, I like George - he's good looking and has a unique personality, I also like Grace's sweetness and Ben's so nice.  The stark contrast of Ben and Ricky is interesting.  Ben's father is also nice but his acting is wooden.  I think they need better directors or something.  They did finally admit they were in California in a season opener as they showed them driving (for real) to the beach and hanging out there (but it was cold) which reminded me that they could really add to things if they did more beach scenes in warm weather - then it could be like Gidget on steroids especially if they filmed them at the famous Malibu ""Cove"" spot where Sally Field frolicked in Gidget :-)  Lastly, I watch because it's easy to watch since not much happens so you can veg out and just watch it with ease, kind of like Laguna Beach/The Hills was..",3,No great messages for teens,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,3793,"['keep', 'waiting', 'great', 'messages', 'teens', 'series', 'have', 'really', 'only', 'found', 'one', 'most', 'teens', 'are', 'having', 'sex', 'most', 'commonly', 'heard', 'words', 'EVERY', 'EPISODE', 'are', 'having', 'sex', 'have', 'sex', 'sex', 'had', 'sex', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'count', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'show', 'had', 'teen', 'would', 'NOT', 'want', 'watching', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'casual', 'sex', 'especially', 'character', 'Adrian', 'show', 'girl', 'who', 'very', 'religious', 'statement', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'married', 'medical', 'school', 'soon', 'sex', 'boyfriend', 'give', 'eventually', 'not', 'great', 'way', 'set', 'example', 'teens', 'one', 'time', 'broach', 'subject', 'm********ion', 'way', 'say', 'heck', 'sex', 'boys', ""'ll"", 'take', 'care', 'things', 'show', 'how', 'quickly', 'solution', 'wore', 'off', 'basically', 'soap', 'like', 'daytime', 'soaps', 'where', 'very', 'little', 'happens', 'things', 'are', 'unrealistic', 'AND', 'grow', 'up', 'newborns', '9-12', 'months', 'one', 'episode', 'just', 'being', 'born', '3', 'so', 'eps', 'ago', 'just', 'soaps', 'do', 'something', 'HATE', 'will', 'like', 'show', 'how', 'unrealistic', 'whole', 'thing', 'Also', 'how', 'fake', 'birth', 'scene', 'completely', 'cut', 'out', 'baby', 'just', 'mother', 'arms', 'break.Other', 'things', 'bother', 'Stop', 'walking', 'hands', 'belly', 'are', 'pregnant', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'real', 'life', 'Show', 'babies', 'more', 'what', 'taking', 'care', 'soaps', 'are', 'just', 'carried', 'here', 'there', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'too', 'used', 'seeing', '16', 'Pregnant/Teen', 'Mom', 'more', 'realistic', 'look', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'acting', 'adults', 'especially', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'pretty', 'bad', 'kids', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'Why', 'would', 'pick', 'role', 'Why', 'was', 'ever', 'picked', 'ANY', 'role', 'acting', 'just', 'lines', 'emotion', 'terrible', 'much', 'pregnant', 'overweight', 'bloated', 'voice', 'awful', 'hard', 'watch', 'know', 'was', 'PG', 'twins', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'pretty', 'sad', 'have', 'watch', 'her.The', 'only', 'things', 'keep', 'watching', 'look', 'feel', 'show', 'are', 'very', 'pretty', 'colors', 'decoration', 'sets', 'great', 'lighting', 'inside', 'film', 'exteriors', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'Ranch', 'Burbank', 'one', 'favorite', 'places', 'see', 'shows', 'done', 'home', 'great', 'old', 'shows', 'such', 'Bewitched', 'Gidget', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Show', 'Dennis', 'Menace', 'Hazel', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'Flying', 'Nun', 'Monkees', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'movies', 'use', 'pretty', 'tight', 'shots', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'most', 'recognizable', 'houses', 'can', 'see', 'enough', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'homes', 'live', 'are', '2', 'houses', 'left', 'Bewitched', 'house', 'down', 'corner', 'also', 'characters', 'like', 'Ashley', 'morose', 'personality', 'like', 'George', 'good', 'looking', 'unique', 'personality', 'also', 'like', 'Grace', 'sweetness', 'Ben', 'so', 'nice', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Ben', 'Ricky', 'interesting', 'Ben', 'father', 'also', 'nice', 'acting', 'wooden', 'think', 'need', 'better', 'directors', 'something', 'did', 'finally', 'were', 'California', 'season', 'opener', 'showed', 'driving', 'real', 'beach', 'hanging', 'out', 'there', 'was', 'cold', 'reminded', 'could', 'really', 'add', 'things', 'did', 'more', 'beach', 'scenes', 'warm', 'weather', 'then', 'could', 'be', 'Gidget', 'steroids', 'especially', 'filmed', 'famous', 'Malibu', 'Cove', 'spot', 'where', 'Sally', 'Field', 'frolicked', 'Gidget', 'Lastly', 'watch', 'easy', 'watch', 'not', 'much', 'happens', 'can', 'veg', 'out', 'just', 'watch', 'ease', 'kind', 'Laguna', 'Beach/The', 'Hills', 'was..']",N/A
