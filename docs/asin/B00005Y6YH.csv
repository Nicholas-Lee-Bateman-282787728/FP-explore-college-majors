With interviews of writers and fans who knew the Babe, and a lot of film footage and still photos from throughout his short (he died at just 53) but amazing life, the film honestly acknowledges his flaws (he missed two months of the 1925 season with syphilis), but reminds viewers that for each fault, he was capable of incredible kindness, as well. He was, ultimately, a big kid, blessed with extraordinary gifts, and this documentary made me wish I'd met him!While Ruth's baseball years are very well known, most films short-change the events not involving the sport, but happily, this film is an exception. From his troubled childhood, as the incorrigible son of a barkeep who 'gave up' on him, dumping him into a church-run orphanage, to his bittersweet post-baseball life (being denied his dream of managing, and watching cancer destroy his vitality, and ultimately, his life), the film is the most complete biography I've seen.""Babe Ruth - The Life Behind the Legend"" is a terrific addition to any sports fan's collection!",5,A Valentine to the Babe!,1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,1178,"[""'re"", 'expecting', 'revisionist', 'unflattering', 'portrait', 'George', 'Herman', 'Ruth', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Life', 'Legend', 'interviews', 'writers', 'fans', 'who', 'knew', 'Babe', 'lot', 'film', 'footage', 'still', 'photos', 'short', 'died', 'just', '53', 'amazing', 'life', 'film', 'honestly', 'flaws', 'missed', 'two', 'months', '1925', 'season', 'syphilis', 'viewers', 'fault', 'was', 'capable', 'incredible', 'kindness', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'ultimately', 'big', 'kid', 'blessed', 'extraordinary', 'gifts', 'documentary', 'made', 'wish', ""'d"", 'met', 'Ruth', 'baseball', 'years', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'most', 'films', 'short-change', 'events', 'not', 'involving', 'sport', 'happily', 'film', 'exception', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'incorrigible', 'son', 'barkeep', 'who', ""'gave"", 'up', 'dumping', 'church-run', 'orphanage', 'bittersweet', 'post-baseball', 'life', 'being', 'denied', 'dream', 'managing', 'watching', 'cancer', 'destroy', 'vitality', 'ultimately', 'life', 'film', 'most', 'complete', 'biography', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Life', 'Legend', 'terrific', 'addition', 'sports', 'fan', 'collection']",Babe Ruth - The Life Behind the Legend

It runs about 45 minutes with excellent commentary from actor Liev Schreiber (X-Men Origins: Wolverine). An orginal HBO special, it did not gloss over some of the less desirable events in Babe Ruth's life (look at today's sports heroes for comparison). But no one can deny that on the field, he set standards that are still admired today.
