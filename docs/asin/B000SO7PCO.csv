Not having seen these episodes during their network run, I have no way of knowing what, if any, scenes have been edited? And before I dare open the set, i'm hoping someone who did see them on TV before the DVD release can give a proper review and list any and all changes that were made? If there have been scenes edited out, i'd like to ask CBS DVD one question? WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY?????????????? It's bad enough that old time favorites like Happy Days and WKRP In Cincinnati, etc, are being released to DVD in severely edited versions because of corporate laziness and the greedy practices of the music industry? (hmmmm too bad we can't sue them the way they're suing us these days lol) But why in the world would there be a problem showing the complete, unedited versions on DVD of shows that were in their original network run only a year ago? Surely the silly copyright problems preventing older shows from being released uncut have been settled for the newer shows? Or should we just accept the fact that the loyal fans of these great shows will forever be screwed by corporations that will never give a damn about anything but our money?",3,UH OH!!!!!
