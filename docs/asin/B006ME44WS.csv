1517276,A1D22OU25XABAK,B006ME44WS,Baranabus,"[4, 4]","This was riveting, albeit painful. Since I was born the same year and I too live in a 'bedsit', it was unnerving and hits upon some of our darkest fears of dying alone.I don't want to spoil too much of the mystery, but will say that she really wasn't the stereotypical 'crazy cat lady' type you'd expect. I took it as not just a parable of urban disconnection but also how she seemed (like many of us from the 80s) like a great example of the 'dress for success' myth- the 'fake it till you make it' idea of the yuppie 80s which was instilled in many people, especially women, that if you put up a good front, you can go anywhere. It reminds me of how we were instructed more in how to dress for work than what to really know, what skills to have. Everyone in this doc says that her exterior persona was striking but that there was a mystery behind it, and some say she was lost. It also sounds like she, having been well-raised but working-class and nearly abandoned, was less equipped to deal with reality than she let on. I get the feeling, from the way she often up and left jobs and housing, that whenever the demands of reality outweighed what she could charm her way through that she ran away. This is not a judgement, but a sad comment on the difficulty of trying to rise above your station with little means of support and feeling like you must conceal who you are and where you come from. I can relate, and I think many people can.The impression the film gives is that she was actually a fragile dreamer, an escapist from a painful background, capable of putting up an excellent exterior partly as a survival mechanism. I think they portray this very well- the actress is excellent and is able to pull off some pretty challenging scenes.It reminded me a little of the true-story comedy ""I love you Phillip Morris"", in which the con-man talks his way into a high finance job, only to be discovered by an auditor as doodling all over the finance reports while hundreds of thousands were being embezzled. While JV doesn't seem to have engaged in anything criminal, it seemed similar in that she may've been someone in way over her head who just fled and retreated when things began to unravel.The best insights seem to come from her ex, Alistair the musician. He's got a good grasp on her problems with a sober, less sentimental take, yet is also compassionate. Many others in the film come off as having been dazzled by her exterior, and not really knowing her- though everyone seems to agree that was Joyce's intention. She clearly kept everyone at a distance on purpose- to hide her upbringing and because she feared losing people, and because she had deep insecurities despite a confidant exterior. Alistair talks of JV's fears of intimacy and happiness, and of losing both, and that makes the most sense.On the film treatment, I thought the re-enactments were actually really effective and moving; only twice did I feel they went over the top and lingered too long on the effect they were trying to acheive. It was really the only way you could try to connect with someone so mysterious; I think it was a good call on the part of the writer/director.On the issue of her death, as someone else stated, the landlord's role in all of it is very suspicious. While reports say her door was bolted from the inside, that doesn't rule out someone leaving thru the window. Also not enough is discussed about how her bills were paid- apparently the documentarian got a lot of resistance when inquiring about her utilities & rent. Though JV lived in public housing, and possibly had rent automatically paid by some kind of public assistance, what about utilities (the TV still being on 3 years later). I've worked in public housing in the US, and while laws may differ, non-payment can get you evicted in 90 days, and someone who had been cleaning houses and couch-surfing could not have a large savings to draw funds from electronically. It's possible either the landlord did it, or a boyfriend who then threatened the landlord. I can buy the idea of being disconnected from family and friends (troubled people often become estranged) but the bills going on for 3 years? Not buying that. I would like to know how far the police traced the money- what payment accounts were set up, when they were set up and by whom- all of it is way too fishy. It's very possible that she died of asthma, that she was estranged, but the financial angle is very hard to believe.This movie really stays with you after watching-it's very haunting. The last image of the real Joyce is telling- while she's happy- at a historic event with Nelson Mandela, she looks excited yet with a deep inner sadness and confusion that you can see in her eyes. Perhaps it's all a matter of suggestion from the narrative, but she really looks vaguely panicked. This combination of exterior flash with internal fragility and fear, along with a certain childlike quality, reminded me of what everyone said about Marilyn Monroe.A fascinating and sad film.Post-script: after reading a discussion on this film, one commenter seemed to have solved the riddle. If she was a victim of abuse and stalking (which it sounds like she was) she most likely was hiding and very afraid of being tracked down. Abusers often contact shelters and friends to find their exes. So she was probably scared witless. She probably *intentionally* made it so that no one could find her. That makes complete sense to me-- also it explains why she would just up and leave jobs. If her stalker exes showed up at work, she'd have to make a hasty exit, if she feared violence. Victims of stalking often take drastic measures out of security reasons. Also, apparently 'council housing' (public housing in England) often has autmated payment of bills through government assistance programs, so that explains the paid bills for years. Poor woman just had to hide from scary, threatening men who abused and terrorized her. Thus she had to become isolated and alone just to survive.

Unfortunately, for this young lady her friends had forgotten about her or felt that she was a burden on them later on when she needed their help.  True she may had shared some of the responsibility for not keeping in contact with her family especially since she was living in UK alone  However, her friends who was in her life early on knew of her predicament. I am not sure if I would say she died of natural causes because there were too many unanswered questions following her death.  I am inclined to believe this was the &#34;perfect murder&#34; because she was too vulnerable and too trusting.  I thank the author of this story for taking the time and the interest of letting the world know besides UK of this tragedy.

1517278,A2R5VKE4YO966D,B006ME44WS,Charles Curtis,"[4, 4]","Joyce Vincent, 38 years old, dies in her London flat at Christmastime 2003, surrounded by partly wrapped presents with the television on. Her body lies there decomposing for three years, until her landlord orders the flat broken into due to the fact he is owed 2800 in back rent, and no one will come to the door.  They find her skeleton lying there, surrounded by those Christmas presents, the television still on.A modern dystopian nightmare, like a Dickens tale revised by Kafka then Camus. As one of the men who found her put it, she had simply melted away, into the floor.Who was this woman, how did this happen?She was not a drug addict or alcoholic. Her cause of death is unclear, but was likely a major asthma attack. The larger mystery: how is it she had lain there undiscovered so long?It turns out that she had been a successful office worker, who had had many friends; a beautiful woman who had been involved in several longterm romantic relationships. The filmmakers delve into her past, find many of the people who knew her, and interview them. She was well liked, men found her very attractive, and she had been very social.. But at the same time, she remained in many ways a cypher. No one knew her family, she spoke of having lost her beloved mother as a child, of being alienated from her father, and then never spoke of the three older sisters who had raised her after her mothers death.  She has relationships with several men, but they never come to fruition in a family. There is an unnamed ""Polish man"" whom she dated in the years leading up to her death who may've abused her. In the end she broke off her relationships, quit jobs when things got difficult and just faded away, and nobody was involved enough to follow up on her, no cared enough to pay attention..Until the her landlord broke her door down and found her lying there, alone, her bones buried under the dust of three years' neglect and abandonment.The film does not explain how the electricity had remained on all that time without payment, nor how the landlord took so long to come looking for his rent.  That seems the biggest mystery here. The attenuated work and romantic relationships and neighbors who could hear the television and smelled something odd coming from the apartment but never did anything seem all too believable. That she had some sort of trauma in her history, both in her family, and with certain men she had dated - none of whom the filmmakers could find or convince to go on camera - also all seem all too credible.It is the details of her life, and the sketch they make of her that makes this film interesting.  There are gaps and question marks, mysteries that are not revealed, leaving the portrait somehow incomplete, but the overall effect is elegiac.  She, like a flickering flame extinguished in the wind..Sad, tragic and strange, but still somehow beautiful.

HOW and WHY NOT is a screaming omission by the prooducers .It is blatently a far greater enigma than Joyce Vincent herself.The landlord would not consent to appear in the film. The unaccountabilty was a distraction and I patienty sat it out waiting for the producers to offer up  why or even possible explanations. Someone was paying the electric because an ignored court order would have sent the bailiffs round, or the police.. She was too despondent towards the end to hold her usual 9-5 jobs and supposedly cleaning out of desperation , since it was so out of characacter So where did the money come from to pay for the bedsit she died in ? She had been living on friends' couches before they lost contact.The only explanation was she had an arrangement or relationship with the landlord,  who killed her and left the corpse to rot , in order to destroy forensics. Moreover,  it's easier than disposing of a dead body if he figured that her room wasn't near immediate neighbours , in the building.. Here her friends do perk up and suggest murder but this idea quickly dissapears as the film  slides swiftly on into  eulogy. Then like every obituary , evidently everyone closes ranks  to preserve a noble memory , especially if available on dvd. I bet they all have their pet theorys on the landlord but it comes too close to the idea she was paying the rent on her back. The closest they come is to dwell on her potential  for abusive relationshipsThe merits of the film are all about how friends and boy-friends care and wonder in hind-sight. The documentary is about them, not her. Their various  sensitivities and insights are moving and worth viewing However there are sadder life stories to get maudlin about. To me the crux of her trajedy lies in not getting married which would have healed being effectively orphaned, at 11 years, and having a disassociative blind-spot later on ( This shared affliction also explains the absent sisters ). Not an incurable if she is savvy enough to date a music manager with connections to the stars. Here an ex who was "" her rock "" and loved her, deals with guilt, and confesses he didn't want to have tinted children because of discrimination and it would have upset his Dad.

Gentile,"[13, 14]","Now that I have Netflix, I am indulging myself in my passion for documentaries, something I usually have done for many years at the Indie movie houses. I have wafted and trudged through many as of late, which, till now, ranged from mind numbingly boring to pleasantly entertaining to very good. I just watched ""Dreams Of A Life"", and I'm still trying to breathe. Brilliant, tragic, touching, haunting, disturbing, are the first words that come to mind when trying to sum up this film. Since there are several excellent reviews with which I agree already posted here, as well as an accurate description of the subject matter of this film, I will not attempt to describe what it is about. I will only say that, as a person who had a very troubled, unloved childhood and youth, who had spent years isolating myself from people, that this film left me in jaw dropping sadness, and a certain sense of relief. That is not to say that it is simply a ""depressing"" movie. It is , as someone else pointed out here...a life lesson, and a warning perhaps about how easily someone can allow themselves, and be allowed, to slip through the cracks. Life and personal relationships are hard, but life is not a spectator sport, as seductive as isolation can be to certain people like myself. I will say that in time, I have learned what for me is a healthy balance of social interaction and alone time, of taking the initiative to reach out to others and be receptive to them in kind. I never knew Joyce, the subject of this film, and I don't know that I am 100% satisfied in answering what happened to this lovely girl. I only know that I was completely unprepared for the devastating power of this brilliant film. Also of note, I abhor the dreaded ""recreation"" scenes in most films, which almost never work. Here, they are 100% effective in conveying the feeling of isolation this young woman who seemingly had ""everything"" experienced, while never being maudlin. Interspersed here are interviews with the real life people that were in Joyce's life, all of whom express shock, incomprehension, or remorse at how this girl they thought they knew wound up a corpse left undiscovered for 3 years in her small apartment in the center of one of the worlds most vibrant cities. The finale, a clip of the real life Joyce, slowly turning her head and looking at the camera, accompanied by the haunting ""Tell Me""...literally left me immobilized for several minutes. A very sad but powerfully important film, exceedingly well done.  Perhaps the only question left unanswered: Why Joyce?

L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[8, 8]","The late Rodney Dangerfield said, ""The only normal people are the ones you don't know too well.""The 2011 documentary DREAMS OF A LIFE asks how a woman named Joyce Vincent, alone in her North London, England, apartment could be dead for three years before being discovered - with her television set playing, no less?  Friends of this woman are interviewed and of course wish they had not let the relationship with her lapse to such a point.There are others to whom you'd want to talk who do not appear in the film.  You might ask:- of Joyce Vincent's landlord, how does a tenant not pay rent for more than three years and you don't act?- of the woman's electricity provider, if Vincent's television was playing all that time, why hadn't you followed up on her unpaid bill?- of her relatives, was there no common acquaintance who could tell you where to find Joyce?- of her postal service, didn't Vincent have uncollected mail?- of her neighbors, did you not hear the television audio nonstop for three years; were there no uncollected packages at her door; did you not smell her body decomposing?For me, those questions are the answer to DREAMS OF A LIFE.  In this so-called age of communication, if anything people know less about one another than ever and are afraid to get any closer than a text message, e-mail, or social media web site allows.  Personally, in my 52 years I've never lived anyplace where I might recognize more than a handful of my neighbors should we cross paths at the grocery store.  I have yet to know a neighborhood where many people interact.  In the seven addresses I've had in my adult life, I've received exactly one knock on the door from anyone welcoming me to the neighborhood.  I gave up trying myself after having the couple that moved next door three addresses ago over for dinner only to have them never invite us to their place.Those who knew Joyce Vincent did not know her well, certainly not well enough.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[17, 17]","There is something so profoundly disturbing about Carol Morley's new documentary ""Dreams of a Life"" that I find it somewhat difficult to articulate my thoughts.  Morley's film chronicles the strange case of Joyce Vincent.  Vincent, a 38 year old London women, had a normal career, a typical family, and a number of interpersonal relationships that you might expect from someone of her age.  Why, then, did no one notice when she died?  Vincent's body lay undiscovered for three years in her flat within the heart of London.  It's an incredible true story, one that you might struggle to believe is even possible.  From the subject matter alone, it's almost impossible not to recommend ""Dreams of a Life"" as a cautionary tale of disconnectedness and isolation.  But I still am so unsettled by the incident, the film itself becomes a somewhat unpleasant (yet unforgettable) homage.The filmmakers sought out those that knew Vincent in an unorthodox advertising campaign.  They found and gathered former co-workers, roommates, and even boyfriends to be interviewed for the movie.  With the use of photos, film, and anecdotes, we learn about Vincent.  The participants all express a great disbelief that this could happen to Vincent and together pull together a fairly complete picture of Vincent as a young and vibrant woman.  All seemingly lost touch with her, though, and were startled by her infamous death and discovery.  It's just incredible that none of her sisters or even the rent collector made an effort to contact the woman in the years that she sat decomposing before a television that was still on!For me, the disconcerting part of ""Dreams of a Life"" is in the dramatic recreation of Vincent's last days.  There is an actress portraying Vincent enacting the mundane events that seemed to lead to her death.  They juxtapose this footage with the crime scene investigators dismantling Vincent's apartment after her discovery.  Maybe it's too spot-on or I'm too squeamish, but it just didn't sit well with me.  But I think that's why ""Dreams of a Life"" is so successful.  It should be horrifying!  It's a movie that had me contemplating my own life, mortality and relationships.  It gets under your skin, that's for sure.  In the end, it may not be a pleasant experience but maybe it's a necessary one.  Haunting and tragic, Joyce Vincent was more than a newspaper headline or a human interest curiosity.  Morley introduces us to the individual and makes us reflect on our own existence.
