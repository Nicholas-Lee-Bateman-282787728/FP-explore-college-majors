Matthew, a gifted 30 something computer engineer and Maria, a spoiled naive teenager. Maria's boyfriend ends up getting her pregnant and not wanting anything to do with her, she drops out of school, her mother is controlling, her fathers dead and shes basically hit rock bottom. Matthew has similiar problems with his father. His fathers abusive and Matthew has somewhat of a suicial streak. During all this, These two end up stumbling upon eachother and eventually falling in love...though its not your typical courtship. Its more of a reluctant meeting of the minds. 2 misfits who just happened to come across eachother at the perfect time. They soon learn a lot about eachother while confronting their inner demons and issues while 'changing' eachother for the better.What makes the film good is not so much the plot but the interaction between the characters. It shares a similar theme/humor with the Todd Solondz movie 'Happiness', except this one has a more serious vibe about it... Serious yet humorous. Its one of those movies you really can't categorize. It's hard to explain in words what makes this movie so good, you just have to watch it. Definitely worth the watch.. different, original & heavy on the irony and dry humor.

I can't begin to tell you how much I loved this movie!!This has to be one of the most original and thoughtful semi-serious-funny-romantic/non-romantic movie I've ever seen and it stands out in it's originality and feel to anything that I can recall that came before it and after it.Hollywood sure doesn't have what it takes to release a movie such as this anymore.  This was the first movie I became aquainted or rather introduced to both Martin Donovan and Ms. Shelley and Donovan's portrayal of the aptly named ""Matthew Slaughter"" has stuck in my mind ever since I first saw this movie. Yeah I was happy to finally see him again in movies such as ""Pipe Dream"" and most recently ""Saved!"" but Matthew Slaughter has lived on in my imagination now for God knows how long.Can't help it, whenever I think of Martin Donvoan, I got to think of Matthew, plus Adrienne Shelley's ""Maria"" is another of the standout characters that has affected me.Love the film, love the soundtrack, and you wouldn't believe how long I've searched both far and wide on the net to try to find the music to this film, but it's next as impossible to finding the actual film itself.Why in God's name is this movie released only for a region 4 and not able to be viewed here in the US?  Who the hell makes these decisions anyway?  Don't they know this film is loved and respected greatly here in America?  As for me I have no proof ofcourse but I chalk things like this up to Anti-American bias.  That's got to be the reason why these things just do not show up here and yet get released around the rest of the world.Please put a stop to this madness and release the movie HERE! in America! and stop screwing around please if you will.

305387,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,630227883X,Bomojaz,"[4, 6]","Strange but interesting saga of a young high school girl (played by Adrienne Shelly), who at the beginning of the movie is pregnant. She leaves home after having a falling out with her father, encounters the disheartened Rachel (who may be a babynapper), and then meets Matthew (Martin Donovan), a mechanical genius who can't stand the shoddy workmanship in today's products and who carries a hand grenade with him just in case he wants to commit suicide. They help each other out, especially regarding their sadistic parents, and decide to get married - which doesn't quite work out, thanks to her plotting mother and her deciding to have an abortion anyway.The tone and presentation of the characters and their actions are very unemotional and deadpan - sort of like RAISING ARIZONA, but without the comic punch. In fact, everything in the movie is so aloof and detached that we almost begin to think the director (Hal Hartley) doesn't care what the audience thinks: it's as if he can't be bothered to have his actors make their points meaningful. It distances us too much from the characters: if they don't care, why should we? Despite this take-it-or-leave-it attitude, there is some sharp dialogue throughout the proceedings.

305388,APP5MBH2BSX6I,630227883X,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[7, 9]","""Trust"" is the story of a pregnant high school girl (Maria, played by Adrienne Shelly) who reveals this fact to her parents one night.  In the ensuing drama she slaps her father and leaves, whereupon he falls to the ground, dead of a heart attack.  (At least four other characters faint dead away during the film too, though not as dead away as dear old Dad.)  The girl thinks her jock boyfriend will marry her.  Way wrong.Jilted, dazed, told by her mother to not come home, Maria begs at a bus stop for five bucks to buy some beer and the lady who loans her money kidnaps a baby left nearby by another idiot teen mom who leaves her baby on the street unattended.  Meanwhile Maria is being pawed in the back room by the store owner, who won't let her have her beer without a little flesh trade.The shop owner isn't the only moment where we wonder who's minding the store in this gaunt film where the parents are sadists, the children jaded beyond their years, and the occasional humor dished out with a heavy dose of bitterness.  There are some laugh-out-loud moments, but don't make the mistake of thinking ""Trust"" is a comedy.  ""Black comedy"" generally means that the filmmaker sees the humor in the worst of situations, and this film is full of the worst of situations.  Its low-budget look is as much a character as any of the speaking parts.Matthew (Martin Donovan) is the other lead in this unconventional romance, and the only thing in the world he's afraid of is his father.  Matthew has been so brutally abused for so long that everyone else cringes when he comes around, because he's basically the personification of the hand grenade he carries around; no one dares get anywhere near his pin.There are some screamingly false moments in ""Trust,"" a film that seems to be all about gritty reality.  The scene where Maria asks her sister and a friend about their experience with motherhood and marriage, for example, is shot with Maria off camera, in interview style, as if the film had suddenly turned into a documentary.  The aforementioned shop owner in real life would certainly not leave his till and merchandise unwatched for several minutes with a disreputable-looking youngster in the store, even for a quickie with the tempting Maria.  The dialogue frequently sounds like all of the players are doing their best deadpan Bogart imitation, romance done film noir style, too often sounding less like individual people than actors spouting the words of a single author who's riffing on one subject or another and using two or more mouths to do the riffing.  In fact, the scene at the bus stop sports the very worst kind of self-conscious dialogue where two characters are actually carrying on separate monologues, like an outtake from a bad French film.  And I haven't seen four people faint in my entire life, but saw it in the span of less than two hours here.Fortunately, these moments are few and far between, and they ultimately amount to only minor distractions.  ""Trust"" is far more often a gripping character study with unfortunate souls who are almost too tough to feel much for, yet in those moments where they let their guard down we cheer.  For instance, a nurse in an abortion clinic pours this high school student a shot of straight whiskey (yeah, that'd happen) in a scene that is quickly rescued by a brilliant monologue for Maria, as she maturely discovers that her self-imposed role of eye candy isn't everything it's cracked up to be.Everyone should support a film that manages to move forward an unusual story while managing to develop the characters into something other than cardboard cutouts whose sole purpose is to advance the action.  ""Trust"" definitely hits its mark in this difficult balance, and in spite of its awkwardness it ends on an upbeat note that's surprisingly downbeat.  This story could not have ended any other way.  It's a remarkable film, one you won't soon forget.",4,Romance noir?,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,3919,"['Trust', 'story', 'pregnant', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'Maria', 'played', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'who', 'fact', 'parents', 'one', 'night', 'ensuing', 'drama', 'father', 'whereupon', 'ground', 'dead', 'heart', 'attack', 'least', 'four', 'other', 'characters', 'faint', 'dead', 'away', 'film', 'too', 'though', 'not', 'dead', 'away', 'dear', 'old', 'Dad', 'girl', 'jock', 'boyfriend', 'will', 'marry', 'Way', 'wrong.Jilted', 'dazed', 'told', 'mother', 'not', 'come', 'home', 'Maria', 'bus', 'stop', 'five', 'bucks', 'buy', 'beer', 'lady', 'who', 'loans', 'money', 'baby', 'left', 'nearby', 'idiot', 'teen', 'mom', 'who', 'baby', 'street', 'unattended', 'Meanwhile', 'Maria', 'being', 'pawed', 'back', 'room', 'store', 'owner', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'have', 'beer', 'little', 'flesh', 'trade.The', 'shop', 'owner', ""n't"", 'only', 'moment', 'where', 'wonder', 'who', 'minding', 'store', 'gaunt', 'film', 'where', 'parents', 'are', 'sadists', 'children', 'jaded', 'years', 'occasional', 'humor', 'dished', 'out', 'heavy', 'dose', 'bitterness', 'are', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'thinking', 'Trust', 'comedy', 'Black', 'comedy', 'generally', 'filmmaker', 'humor', 'worst', 'situations', 'film', 'full', 'worst', 'situations', 'low-budget', 'look', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'speaking', 'parts.Matthew', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'other', 'lead', 'unconventional', 'romance', 'only', 'thing', 'world', 'afraid', 'father', 'Matthew', 'been', 'so', 'brutally', 'abused', 'so', 'long', 'everyone', 'else', 'when', 'around', 'basically', 'personification', 'hand', 'grenade', 'one', 'get', 'anywhere', 'pin.There', 'are', 'screamingly', 'false', 'moments', 'Trust', 'film', 'be', 'gritty', 'reality', 'scene', 'where', 'Maria', 'sister', 'friend', 'experience', 'motherhood', 'marriage', 'example', 'shot', 'Maria', 'camera', 'interview', 'style', 'film', 'had', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'documentary', 'aforementioned', 'shop', 'owner', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'certainly', 'not', 'leave', 'till', 'merchandise', 'unwatched', 'several', 'minutes', 'disreputable-looking', 'youngster', 'store', 'even', 'quickie', 'tempting', 'Maria', 'dialogue', 'frequently', 'players', 'are', 'doing', 'best', 'deadpan', 'Bogart', 'imitation', 'romance', 'done', 'film', 'noir', 'style', 'too', 'often', 'sounding', 'less', 'individual', 'people', 'actors', 'spouting', 'words', 'single', 'author', 'who', 'riffing', 'one', 'subject', 'using', 'two', 'more', 'mouths', 'do', 'riffing', 'fact', 'scene', 'bus', 'stop', 'sports', 'very', 'worst', 'kind', 'self-conscious', 'dialogue', 'where', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'carrying', 'separate', 'monologues', 'outtake', 'bad', 'French', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'four', 'people', 'faint', 'entire', 'life', 'saw', 'span', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'here.Fortunately', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'ultimately', 'amount', 'only', 'minor', 'distractions', 'Trust', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'gripping', 'character', 'study', 'unfortunate', 'souls', 'who', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'tough', 'feel', 'much', 'yet', 'moments', 'where', 'let', 'guard', 'cheer', 'instance', 'nurse', 'abortion', 'clinic', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'shot', 'straight', 'whiskey', 'yeah', ""'d"", 'happen', 'scene', 'quickly', 'rescued', 'brilliant', 'monologue', 'Maria', 'maturely', 'self-imposed', 'role', 'eye', 'candy', ""n't"", 'everything', 'cracked', 'up', 'be.Everyone', 'should', 'support', 'film', 'move', 'forward', 'unusual', 'story', 'managing', 'develop', 'characters', 'something', 'other', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'sole', 'purpose', 'advance', 'action', 'Trust', 'definitely', 'mark', 'difficult', 'balance', 'spite', 'awkwardness', 'upbeat', 'note', 'surprisingly', 'downbeat', 'story', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'ended', 'other', 'way', 'remarkable', 'film', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget']",N/A
305389,A3AHA3LTY0O0RV,630227883X,"Chris ""the most passionate music/film fan alive.""","[1, 1]","So finally, FINALLY.... Trust comes to DVD and it is a Region 1, USA/NTSC release. Years and years ago, I bought Trust directly from Hal Hartley's production company, and it is a region 4, PAL-format DVD (made for Australia). Thankfully I have a region-free NTSC/PAL DVD player, or else I would have been quite disappointed by not ever being able to watch it. I don't know exactly when this film was released for USA/Canada audiences, but I'm just glad it finally happened (and I'll be picking this up in addition to my region 4 disc, just for convenience purposes!)For those of you who don't know, Hal Hartley's TRUST is an absolute gem of independent filmmaking. This is a story where you care about EVERY character in the film, as the character development is ridiculously in-depth.I don't want to ruin any of the story for you... if you're on this page, you know about the film, or you were curious enough to research it.In short, the film is laugh-out-loud funny, absolutely dark, DRY, sarcastic, and quick-witted. You absolutely care about the two main characters, and feel sympathy, or empathy, for all of the others. The music's great, the plot is simple but brilliant, and it pokes fun (in a good way) at less intelligent people (such as Maria's boyfriend, or Maria herself). As mentioned above-- the main thing with this film is GREAT character development. In some scenes, this development is way short, and in others, it is deep. But you definitely get a solid understanding of every single character in the movie, and their quirks and/or sadistic behavior.I first found out about this film from a book about good movies, released in 1995, called ""Video's Best"" by Mark Saturn (available here on Amazon). I rented Trust from the video store back in 1999 and absolutely fell in love with it. Bought it used on VHS years and years back. I would say it is in my top 10 films of all-time, and I am a HUGE movie buff. Huge.So yeah... if you're here because you like indie film, and/or are familiar with Hal Hartley's genius, don't hesitate to pick this up. And if you're here because you just heard about it, and being one of the early films of the late, great Adrienne Shelly, again.... don't hesitate to pick it up. You won't regret it.",5,One of the best indie films ever made.

Adrienne Shelly does a wonderful job as an angst-ridden slacker generation type. As far as Hartley's fare goes, Trust is not a huge departure, it has the usual offbeat humor, realism beneath the surface, interesting use of language, and reminds me maybe of a light-hearted version of Godard. Godard comes to mind anyway. If you like a comedy with some substance, I would recommend this one. Donovan's character carries a grenade, what more can one ask for.

Perhaps the added publicity given to Adrienne Shelley's acting career after her brutal murder will cause this to be rectified quickly.Shelley and Donovan had hipness and chemistry and a great style. It's a minimalist film, but it lingers with you.Watching Hal Hartley's Trust for the second time 15 years later is exhilarating and somewhat disappointing. The characters are contrived and overintellectualized, and the conflict between parent and child here doesn't ring true (it seems to have the usual bitterness of college sophomores). Also the gestures and dialogue are stagy and slightly pretentious. Never mind that; you're missing the point. The film is not aiming at realism; it's aiming at conveying the emotional turbulence of young adult struggling to break free from the orbit of their parents.Plot and incident flow naturally and often end up in unexpected places. There's lots of surprises, many of them comic. The film is about throwing characters together and watching how they react. The moment where the girl messes up the kitchen makes you wonder, how will the father react? The dialogue (reminiscient of Stoppard or Mamet) is curt and enigmatic and challenging. And always entertaining. People are learning from one another and changing..possibly improving. The movie Trust is less about plot than a certain attitude toward life--how much trust should we place in family, friends, peers? People don't have secrets or histories; they have metaphysical complaints and frustrated dreams. Martin Donovan and Adrienne Shelly are not only young charismatic actors, they act and react with subtlety and focus. Yet both have chemistry with one another and manage to sustain this intensity without going too far (Kudos to Mr. Hartley for not aimingfor sympathy or making motives too transparent). Donovan seems adept at playing characters about to boil under, but manage to hold it in (He's at his best in the film Surviving Desire,).Adrienne, that moment when you put on your glasses at the end was a great cinematic moment. Hopeful, assertive and maybe even cocky. Your fans will always have that moment to remember you by.If you liked Trust, you'd also enjoy: Hartley's Surviving Desire (although it's more arty), Jill Sprecher's 13 Conversations about One Thing and her earlier film, Clockwatchers).",5,so where's the DVD?,1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,2383,"['Strangely', 'time', 'write', 'DVD', 'not', 'available', 'USA', 'Perhaps', 'added', 'publicity', 'given', 'Adrienne', 'Shelley', 'acting', 'career', 'brutal', 'murder', 'will', 'cause', 'be', 'rectified', 'quickly.Shelley', 'Donovan', 'had', 'hipness', 'chemistry', 'great', 'style', 'minimalist', 'film', 'you.Watching', 'Hal', 'Hartley', 'Trust', 'second', 'time', '15', 'years', 'later', 'exhilarating', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'characters', 'are', 'contrived', 'overintellectualized', 'conflict', 'parent', 'child', 'here', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'have', 'usual', 'bitterness', 'college', 'sophomores', 'Also', 'gestures', 'dialogue', 'are', 'stagy', 'slightly', 'pretentious', 'mind', ""'re"", 'missing', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'aiming', 'realism', 'aiming', 'conveying', 'emotional', 'turbulence', 'young', 'adult', 'struggling', 'break', 'free', 'orbit', 'parents.Plot', 'incident', 'flow', 'naturally', 'often', 'end', 'up', 'unexpected', 'places', 'lots', 'surprises', 'many', 'comic', 'film', 'throwing', 'characters', 'together', 'watching', 'how', 'react', 'moment', 'where', 'girl', 'up', 'kitchen', 'wonder', 'how', 'will', 'father', 'react', 'dialogue', 'reminiscient', 'Stoppard', 'Mamet', 'curt', 'enigmatic', 'challenging', 'always', 'entertaining', 'People', 'are', 'learning', 'one', 'changing..possibly', 'improving', 'movie', 'Trust', 'less', 'plot', 'certain', 'attitude', 'life', 'how', 'much', 'trust', 'should', 'place', 'family', 'friends', 'peers', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'secrets', 'histories', 'have', 'metaphysical', 'complaints', 'frustrated', 'dreams', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'young', 'charismatic', 'actors', 'act', 'react', 'subtlety', 'focus', 'have', 'chemistry', 'one', 'manage', 'sustain', 'intensity', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'Kudos', 'Mr.', 'Hartley', 'not', 'aimingfor', 'sympathy', 'making', 'motives', 'too', 'transparent', 'Donovan', 'adept', 'playing', 'characters', 'boil', 'manage', 'hold', 'best', 'film', 'Surviving', 'Desire', '.Adrienne', 'moment', 'when', 'put', 'glasses', 'end', 'was', 'great', 'cinematic', 'moment', 'Hopeful', 'assertive', 'maybe', 'even', 'cocky', 'fans', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'moment', 'remember', 'by.If', 'liked', 'Trust', ""'d"", 'also', 'enjoy', 'Hartley', 'Surviving', 'Desire', 'more', 'arty', 'Jill', 'Sprecher', '13', 'Conversations', 'One', 'Thing', 'earlier', 'film', 'Clockwatchers']",N/A

The discourse was uniquely deadpan and honest at the same time.  The acting was fabulous.  Martin Donovan promptly became one of the few actors, and the only actor from North America, whose work is required viewing.  I have a somewhat longer list of actresses, but being an unrepentant auteurist, required films are almost always based on director.After seeing Trust, Hal Hartley was lodged firmly in the mandatory list.  The relationship between Maria and Matthew managed to be both realistic and stylized at the same time.  Not an easy combination to pull off.  They talk to each other, rarely look at each other, and yet the connection is palpable.  The film is deeply compassionate.  The dialogue is like a sort of music, especially in its rhythms, its pauses.  The supporting character roles, especially Maria's father are painted precisely with deft strokes.Trust is one of my favorite Hartley films.  Flirt is the only film of his I have found disappointing, Simple Men and The Book of Life are my favorites.  I loved The Unbelievable Truth.  I seem to have liked No Such Thing more than most other Hartley fans and Amateur slightly less, although I did like it.Trust really should be on DVD and, although several Hartley films have just been released on DVD Trust does not seem to be scheduled yet.
