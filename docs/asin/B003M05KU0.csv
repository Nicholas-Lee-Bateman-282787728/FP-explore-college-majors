If I actually try to say about this movie what I think it will be my last review. The movie not even trying anything except showing zero imagination and I guess nobody heard word benchmark in movie's colleges. In addition though movie supposedly done in porn industry we dont see anything and I mean anything. If you into porn I recommend consider some of John Leslie flicks or Brigitte Lahaie.

I thought it was going to be decent but it turned out even a bit better than that.Leelee Sobieski plays a film school grad who can't get arrested in Hollywood. She ends up taking a job as editor with an adult film company figuring she can use their facilities and gear to shoot her own script after hours. As she's afraid of sex ( or afraid she'll suck at it) the set up is a bit obvious. But what surprised me was the quality of the script. Given the set-up, much of the story was paint by numbers, but the dialogue for much of the film was more clever and funnier than you'd find in much higher budget outings. Some of the characters were written very well. Unfortunately, some of the story is simple minded and you really don't buy it, but the parts that are good are so good they help carry the weak stuff.Another thing that got me was how well they depicted what goes on during a shoot and in post production. The script writer knows his way around and gave a decent feel for what actually happens during editing, sound editing, scheduling etc. The budget is not very high, with the proceedings being limited to a few sets. Some of the lensing though was better than I expected. Some of the shots were genuinely good.The cast had a few surprises. Leelee Sobieski has been in her share of movies and seeing Denise Richards is always a treat. But many of the other characters do a better than average job.This is no great movie by any means but there is enough going on here to keep most movie goers entertained. I gave it 3 stars, but 3 1/2 is not at all out of the question.",3,Bliss is Closer than you Might Think,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,1606,"['was', 'quite', 'surprise', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'decent', 'turned', 'out', 'even', 'bit', 'better', 'that.Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'film', 'school', 'grad', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'arrested', 'Hollywood', 'up', 'taking', 'job', 'editor', 'adult', 'film', 'company', 'figuring', 'can', 'use', 'facilities', 'gear', 'shoot', 'own', 'script', 'hours', 'afraid', 'sex', ""'ll"", 'suck', 'set', 'up', 'bit', 'obvious', 'what', 'surprised', 'was', 'quality', 'script', 'Given', 'set-up', 'much', 'story', 'was', 'paint', 'numbers', 'dialogue', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'clever', 'funnier', ""'d"", 'find', 'much', 'higher', 'budget', 'outings', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'simple', 'minded', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'parts', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'help', 'carry', 'weak', 'stuff.Another', 'thing', 'got', 'was', 'how', 'well', 'depicted', 'what', 'shoot', 'post', 'production', 'script', 'writer', 'way', 'gave', 'decent', 'feel', 'what', 'actually', 'editing', 'sound', 'editing', 'scheduling', 'etc', 'budget', 'not', 'very', 'high', 'proceedings', 'being', 'limited', 'few', 'sets', 'lensing', 'though', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'shots', 'were', 'genuinely', 'good.The', 'cast', 'had', 'few', 'surprises', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'been', 'share', 'movies', 'seeing', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'always', 'treat', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'do', 'better', 'average', 'job.This', 'great', 'movie', 'means', 'enough', 'going', 'here', 'keep', 'most', 'movie', 'goers', 'entertained', 'gave', '3', 'stars', '3', '1/2', 'not', 'question']",Finding Bliss

It is less erotic than what one would expect. There are only a few brief nude scenes and none with the major stars. The adult aspect is the crude porn language and simulated sex scenes.Leelee Sobieski stars a Jody, a naive near-virginal woman with her own sexual hang-ups. She ends up editing adult videos for director Jeff Drake (Matt Davis) who wants to show adult movies in main stream art theaters. He utilizes Jody's perspective for editing and writing. He is also an alumni from the same film academy. Jody has her own script, which is perhaps too autobiographical, about a girl who wants to wait for sex. She uses the studio...and their actors to make the film. It seems every porno star wants to be a legitimatize actor and would do anything for the opportunity.The movie was mildly funny. The humor was front loaded as naive Jody discovers the porno industry and learns its terminology. I may never use an ATM again.  Kristen Johnston was a treat in her brash role as usual, Jamie Kennedy was a flop, and Mircea Monroe is always pleasing eye candy.F-bomb, sex, nudity including full frontal male (Jamie Kennedy or body double).",4,THAT'S A LUCKY PICKLE,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,1229,"['romantic', 'comedy', 'pron', 'industry', 'background', 'so', 'guys', 'will', 'watch', 'less', 'erotic', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'brief', 'nude', 'scenes', 'none', 'major', 'stars', 'adult', 'aspect', 'crude', 'porn', 'language', 'simulated', 'sex', 'scenes.Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'Jody', 'naive', 'near-virginal', 'woman', 'own', 'sexual', 'hang-ups', 'up', 'editing', 'adult', 'videos', 'director', 'Jeff', 'Drake', 'Matt', 'Davis', 'who', 'show', 'adult', 'movies', 'main', 'stream', 'art', 'theaters', 'Jody', 'perspective', 'editing', 'writing', 'also', 'alumni', 'same', 'film', 'academy', 'Jody', 'own', 'script', 'perhaps', 'too', 'autobiographical', 'girl', 'who', 'wait', 'sex', 'studio', 'actors', 'make', 'film', 'porno', 'star', 'be', 'legitimatize', 'actor', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'opportunity.The', 'movie', 'was', 'mildly', 'funny', 'humor', 'was', 'front', 'loaded', 'naive', 'Jody', 'porno', 'industry', 'terminology', 'may', 'never', 'use', 'ATM', 'again', 'Kristen', 'Johnston', 'was', 'treat', 'brash', 'role', 'usual', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'flop', 'Mircea', 'Monroe', 'always', 'pleasing', 'eye', 'candy.F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'including', 'full', 'frontal', 'male', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'body', 'double']",Finding Bliss
1353854,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B003M05KU0,Z Hayes,"[13, 15]","Lee Lee Sobieski is one of my favorite actors, and it's a pity she hasn't had more commercial success with her films. Many of her films are indies and I'm amazed by her ability to play various sorts of characters as evidenced by her work in movies like ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Uprising"", ""The Glass House"", etc. Here, Sobieski plays Jody Balaban, a fresh graduate from NYU's Film School who shows promise but finds that talent and enthusiasm do not necessarily translate into instant success.Frustrated by her inability to attract prominent studios' attention, Jody eventually lands a job at Grind Studios, which is in the business of making porn flicks. Jody is initially disgusted by her job, which entails editing porn movies, and is also haunted by her history of failed relationships. Jody's character is one who suffers from sexual hang-ups and thinks she is a ""lousy lay"". When she meets fellow NYU alum and high achiever Jeff Drake (Matt Davis), she is shocked to find he's become an adult film director, albeit a successful one. There is some sexual tension between the two which gets developed over the course of the movie, and I thought it was credibly done. The strong chemistry between the lead actors also helps advance the romance sub-plot.I felt this was a nicely done independent movie with the right elements, i.e. an engaging and interesting plot, funny dialogue, and great casting. Oh, and watch out for Denise Richards in this one - she was quite a surprise! The other cast members, especially those that played the roles of adult film actors were also believable - they portrayed their roles with credibility instead of coming off as caricatures. This is an honestly funny movie that deserves a wider audience.",4,Funny & sexy!,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,1727,"['Lee', 'Lee', 'Sobieski', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'pity', ""n't"", 'had', 'more', 'commercial', 'success', 'films', 'Many', 'films', 'are', 'indies', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'ability', 'play', 'various', 'sorts', 'characters', 'evidenced', 'work', 'movies', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'Uprising', 'Glass', 'House', 'etc', 'Here', 'Sobieski', 'Jody', 'Balaban', 'fresh', 'graduate', 'NYU', 'Film', 'School', 'who', 'promise', 'talent', 'enthusiasm', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'translate', 'instant', 'success.Frustrated', 'inability', 'attract', 'prominent', 'studios', 'attention', 'Jody', 'eventually', 'job', 'Grind', 'Studios', 'business', 'making', 'porn', 'flicks', 'Jody', 'initially', 'disgusted', 'job', 'editing', 'porn', 'movies', 'also', 'haunted', 'history', 'failed', 'relationships', 'Jody', 'character', 'one', 'who', 'sexual', 'hang-ups', 'thinks', 'lousy', 'lay', 'When', 'fellow', 'NYU', 'alum', 'high', 'achiever', 'Jeff', 'Drake', 'Matt', 'Davis', 'shocked', 'find', 'become', 'adult', 'film', 'director', 'successful', 'one', 'sexual', 'tension', 'two', 'developed', 'course', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'credibly', 'done', 'strong', 'chemistry', 'lead', 'actors', 'also', 'advance', 'romance', 'sub-plot.I', 'felt', 'was', 'nicely', 'done', 'independent', 'movie', 'right', 'elements', 'i.e', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'plot', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'great', 'casting', 'Oh', 'watch', 'out', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'one', 'was', 'quite', 'surprise', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'especially', 'played', 'roles', 'adult', 'film', 'actors', 'were', 'also', 'believable', 'portrayed', 'roles', 'credibility', 'instead', 'coming', 'off', 'caricatures', 'honestly', 'funny', 'movie', 'wider', 'audience']",Finding Bliss
