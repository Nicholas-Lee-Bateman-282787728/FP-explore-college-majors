1576329,A1S0SJUFEGOC8J,B008UE8ICK,B. Sounthonevichith,"[5, 14]","Here's a review of the actual blu ray. This movie is basically the first 10 episodes of the anime series compressed to roughly 70 minutes or 75 minutes with the ending credits. If you've seen the anime then you'll know what to expect. There's definately changes to the story, but it's doesn't change my enjoyment of it. Anyway, the characters look all brand new and younger while the anime they look more rugged and rough. Also, some of the music doesn't match the scenes like the anime does. It's a blood bath of show so the music should match this. Movie is very good but I'm not reviewing a movie, I'm reviewing a blu ray purchase. If you know anything about Viz media, they're cheapos. I love Ranma and Maison Ikkoku and thank God Viz brought them over as Maison Ikkoku is one of my absolute favorite and I never get bored of Ranma. However, with that said, they are still very cheap as far as extras goes and this is no exception. Movie is 3 stars as the hand drawn artworks are freaking gorgeous story is very good. Then you get the CGI portion and they're just horrendous, cheap looking and jar droppingly out of place when it shifts from one scene to the next and most of them are in the fight scenes. This is one star off. The next one is the music. Like I stated before, some of the music simply doesn't fit the scenes to me. Maybe they'll fit to you, but to me, they simply seem out of place. This is 1/2 a star off. The third is the blu ray itself. If you're expecting tons of extras, forget about it. There's absolutely none other than a Neon Alley trailer and some sketch drawings. This is 1/2 star off so I'm giving 3 stars. Still looking forward to the 2nd and 3rd portion and here's hoping the CGIs are done better. If you like the anime, you'll like this movie as well. If you didn't, you probably won't like this. I loved the anime and I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, other than the CGI portions. Oh, I didn't even bother with the English dub as Viz is pretty bad at this portion too and the original dub casts were extremely bad.",3,"Pretty good, for the most part",1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2050,"['Here', 'review', 'actual', 'blu', 'ray', 'movie', 'basically', 'first', '10', 'episodes', 'anime', 'series', 'compressed', 'roughly', '70', 'minutes', '75', 'minutes', 'ending', 'credits', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anime', 'then', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'definately', 'changes', 'story', ""n't"", 'change', 'enjoyment', 'Anyway', 'characters', 'look', 'brand', 'new', 'younger', 'anime', 'look', 'more', 'rugged', 'rough', 'Also', 'music', ""n't"", 'match', 'scenes', 'anime', 'blood', 'bath', 'show', 'music', 'should', 'match', 'Movie', 'very', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'reviewing', 'movie', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'blu', 'ray', 'purchase', 'know', 'anything', 'Viz', 'media', ""'re"", 'cheapos', 'love', 'Ranma', 'Maison', 'Ikkoku', 'thank', 'God', 'Viz', 'brought', 'over', 'Maison', 'Ikkoku', 'one', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'never', 'get', 'bored', 'Ranma', 'However', 'said', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'cheap', 'as', 'far', 'extras', 'exception', 'Movie', '3', 'stars', 'hand', 'drawn', 'artworks', 'are', 'freaking', 'gorgeous', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'Then', 'get', 'CGI', 'portion', ""'re"", 'just', 'horrendous', 'cheap', 'looking', 'jar', 'droppingly', 'place', 'when', 'shifts', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'most', 'are', 'fight', 'scenes', 'one', 'star', 'next', 'one', 'music', 'stated', 'music', 'simply', ""n't"", 'fit', 'scenes', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'fit', 'simply', 'seem', 'place', '1/2', 'star', 'third', 'blu', 'ray', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'tons', 'extras', 'forget', 'absolutely', 'none', 'other', 'Neon', 'Alley', 'trailer', 'sketch', 'drawings', '1/2', 'star', ""'m"", 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'Still', 'looking', 'forward', '2nd', '3rd', 'portion', 'here', 'hoping', 'CGIs', 'are', 'done', 'better', 'like', 'anime', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'loved', 'anime', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'other', 'CGI', 'portions', 'Oh', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'English', 'dub', 'Viz', 'pretty', 'bad', 'portion', 'too', 'original', 'dub', 'casts', 'were', 'extremely', 'bad']",Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King

So I do own it and have watched it, despite the lack of the &#34;Amazon Verified Purchase&#34; status.  Having cleared the air on that, here is my review.I must strongly recommend against any Berserk fan from purchasing this movie.  This is nothing more than an abridged, re-make of the original Japanese television series.  It is even audacious enough to re-use the exact same lines, the exact same scenes, and the exact same choreography.  One would think that, being a more recent title, that at least the animation would be upgraded and some of the fight scenes creatively re-invented, but no.  If anything, the story is noticeably less dark in this version compared to the anime and thus the characters and their motives lack the same level of power and depth.If you're craving Berserk, do yourself a favor and re-watch the anime.

1576338,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B008UE8ICK,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","In 1990, the manga series ""Berserk"" was published by Hakusensha for Jets Comics.  Created by Kentaro Miura, the series would be serialized in ""Young Animal"" and a 25-episode episode anime series was made.  Also, video games and now an animated film series.With the first animated film ""Berserk Golden Age Arc 1: The Egg of the King"" released in Japan on Feb. 2012 and in the U.S. courtesy of Viz Media on Blu-ray in Nov. 2012.The second animated film ""Berserk Golden Age Arc 2: The Battle for Doldrey"" was released in theaters in Japan on June 2012 while the third animated film ""Berserk Golden Age Arc III: Descent"" was released in theaters in Japan on Feb. 2013.  The other two animated films have also been licensed by Viz Media.While many fans are drawn to the series for its medieval storyline, its violent action-packed storyline and its characters, for some, it has been a series that Kentaro Miura has taken his time with, as one to two volumes of the manga series are released each year.  And as of 2o13, a total of 36 volumes have been released.  So, for 20 years, this storyline has been released slowly but still is going strong and admired by many readers internationally.As the films feature different animated artwork and voice acting since its 1997 anime series, the animated film series is produced by Studio 4C and is directed by Toshiyuki Kubooka (""Gin Rei"", ""Gunbuster""), screenplay by Ichiro Okouchi (""Angelic Layer"", ""Azumanga Daioh"", ""Brave Story"", ""Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion""), music by Shiro Sagisu (""Bleach"", ""Kimagure Orange Road"", ""Nadia - The Secret of Blue Water"", ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" series and films), character design by Naoyuki Onda (""Armitage III"", ""King of Thorn"", ""Ergo Proxy"") and art direction by Goki Nakamura (""King of Thorn"", ""Ghost in the Shell II: Innocence"", ""Cat Soup"") and Yusuke Takeda (""Armitage IIII"", "".hack/Quantum"").VIDEO:""Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 1 - The Egg of the King"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  The first thing that long time fans will see the creative difference that Studio 4C brings to character designs but also giving a new look with detailed art backgrounds and the studio's integration of 2D and 3D which they are known for.  The anime is colorful, while not super detailed when it comes to shading of the characters, the art backgrounds and mechanical designs are quite pleasing to watch.But I'm sure viewers will have a subjective opinion towards the overall look of the film versus how things looked in the original 1997 anime series and compared to the manga series.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 1 - The Egg of the King is presented in English and Japanese DTS-HD MA with English subtitles.  The dialogue and music is crisp and clear and while most surround usage is during the action sequence, the film utilizes a wonderful score from the legendary anime composer Shiro Sagisu.  The voice acting is well-done on both Japanese and English soundtracks but it's important for people to know that the voice acting does not utilize the same talent from the original 1997 animated TV series.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 1 - The Egg of the King"" comes with a production art gallery.JUDGMENT CALL:For someone who follows ""Berserk"", part of me was excited that a new animated film was created because so many people have been waiting for more ""Berserk"" for a long time.  The manga is released slowly and suffice to say, when I was following this series, It was not long after graduating from high school.  And like many people who have grown up with this series, nearly 30-years have past and it still has not concluded.So, I think that for fans, seeing ""Berserk"" as an animated film is exciting...But there is a problem when it comes to animated films that are based on the manga series and are not standalone stories.  And the fact is that only so much storyline can be included in an abridged version of the film.With the animated TV series having been released in Japan (and hopefully in the U.S. in the near future), people can watch and get a better idea of the storyline of Guts.In fact, the animated film tries to cover seven episodes featured in the anime series in 76 minutes and that's pretty tough.  While we see images of Guts and his adoptive father Gambino in short flashbacks, we miss out on important details of how Guts killed him.So, there is just more story that is featured in the anime and manga series than what is seen in the animated film.It would have been great if fans got an all new standalone story, not an abridged version of what was seen on television and the manga series because the animated series was well-done for its time and what people are expecting is a continuance of the story and something new.So, in essence, what viewers are watching is an abridged film utilizing today's animation technology with 2D and 3D implemented courtesy of Studio 4C.While two more films are yet to be released on Blu-ray, I still found ""Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 1 - The Egg of the King"" to be enjoyable and for those who are not interested in reading the manga series or watching the old school animated series will surely find the animated film series to be good enough for them.For those new to ""Berserk"", it's important for them to know that like the animated TV series and the manga, this is one of the most violent series that was featured in Japan. And that violence carries onto the animated series.  There is a lot of blood, a lot of decapitations, bodies cut apart, guts spilling out... this is a series that will appeal to those who like violent swordfighting action.The Blu-ray features a colorful pallete with beautiful art backgrounds and utilization of 2D and 3D was good, dialogue and music was crystal clear but not too immersive as I would have hoped.  And special features is only a production gallery and that's it.Overall, ""Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 1 - The Egg of the King"" is an entertaining yet violent action animated film based on the manga series.  While those who want the story may want to opt for the manga or 1997 anime series, for those with no interest in reading past volumes or watching the old school animated version will enjoy this first part of the ""Berserk: The Golden Age"" trilogy.",3,"""Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 1 - The Egg of the King"" is an entertaining yet violent action animated film but...",1364601600,"03 30,

The character depth is too low, there is orchestral music, but not the original spellbinding music from the series, most of the story is without background music. I found it quite a huge dissapointment. It's short, and the ending I went like ""What the???""?I mean, I saw the ending, and thought, this can't be the ending! There must be a pause here, and it's going to get better! (as the movie really started to get sloppy near the end).The most popular fight with Guts against the 100 bandids is missing, what happens to Griffith in the castle with the king's daughter, how Griffith gets tortured and the band of the hawks almost cease to exist, how Guts rescues them, how Griffith becomes a demon eaten by his own ambition, and what about end of the series? All these scenes are left out, and some frames are shown, to give you clues. You'd only understand if you've seen the series. Just like watching photo's, and you need to make the link in your mind, but unless you've seen the series, those photo's are only probabilities, and you can't know for certain what exactly happened after Guts left the band, from watching the movie alone!It's really someone who put everything in a pot, and had enough of moviemaking, and decided to publish a half finished product!Probably the worst Berserk ever!Kind of feels like a filler, and a real bad one, only it's repeating the series instead of being new!If you watched the series, you know that the movie is about between 25% and 50% of the series end, which makes me believe there's going to be a second part of it!A HUGE disappointment, DON'T BUY!SPOILER ALERT:[spoiler]The story starts where Guts defeats the big masked guy with the axe in the beginning, you get another fight with him and the huge goat demon in the castle, and ends where Griffith talks to the kings daughter on the fountain, (the scene just before he gets intimate with her in the series), about how a friend to him should be someone equal, someone with his own dreams; and how Guts heard this, and decided to be Griffith's equal by departing from Griffith, and following his own goal.So basically it ends by Guts leaving the band.

It turns out that the cg parts are actually the best parts of the film. In particular, Zodd is very well modeled. Never before has he looked as lethal and ferocious as in this film. Judging from the less than stellar 2d animation, this crew would simply not have been up to the challenge of pulling off the battles without relying on cg. They are quite extravagant and feature many realistic details of armor and siegecraft, sweeping camera angles etc. Sometimes you have a scene that contains both cg and hand drawn characters - frequently the grunts are cg, but charlotte and griffith are usually cg as well when not in closeup, owing to the complexity of their costumes and they look a bit odd standing next to guts or what have you. The one point where the 2d shines is in some of the character close-ups which are well drawn, mainly guts and griffith. The english voice cast is quite good. Personally, I have always found the golden age arc to be slow so this condensed version is more to my liking. So while not a masterpiece, this is still a thoroughly entertaining film, and one that now has me looking forward to the next two installments (the film closes with a preview of the battle for doldrey which looks like it will be even better).",4,not bad,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,1374,"['Im', 'giant', 'berserk', 'fan', 'have', 'had', 'preordered', 'aeons', 'wasnt', 'expecting', 'much', 'film', 'heavily', 'cg', 'out', 'cg', 'parts', 'are', 'actually', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'particular', 'Zodd', 'very', 'well', 'modeled', 'Never', 'before', 'looked', 'lethal', 'ferocious', 'film', 'Judging', 'less', 'stellar', '2d', 'animation', 'crew', 'would', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'challenge', 'pulling', 'off', 'battles', 'relying', 'cg', 'are', 'quite', 'extravagant', 'feature', 'many', 'realistic', 'details', 'armor', 'siegecraft', 'sweeping', 'camera', 'angles', 'etc', 'Sometimes', 'have', 'scene', 'cg', 'hand', 'drawn', 'characters', 'frequently', 'grunts', 'are', 'cg', 'charlotte', 'griffith', 'are', 'usually', 'cg', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'not', 'closeup', 'owing', 'complexity', 'costumes', 'look', 'bit', 'odd', 'standing', 'next', 'guts', 'what', 'have', 'one', 'point', 'where', '2d', 'shines', 'character', 'close-ups', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'mainly', 'guts', 'griffith', 'english', 'voice', 'cast', 'quite', 'good', 'Personally', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'golden', 'age', 'arc', 'be', 'slow', 'condensed', 'version', 'more', 'liking', 'So', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'one', 'now', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'two', 'installments', 'film', 'preview', 'battle', 'doldrey', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'better']",Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King

It's basically a quick recap of the anime series up to a certain point.However, if you have not read the manga and seen the anime, don't watch this movie---you'll be left in the dark when it shows a few scenes that fast forward through Gut's life.....Among other things, lets just say it helps if you know the back story and other events going on.  Imagine if Game of Thrones (any of the 1K page books) were condensed into a 150 page novel----get the idea?But as a huge fan of the series, it felt great seeing the Berserk characters back in action!

Griffith then gives him this ""hawk-like stare-down"" of ""your doom is certain"" and I thought that was so flipping awesome---it has to do with how well the characters were drawn and how well there eyes convey emotion!  Griffith's stare down was so scary its like I was nervous!  Well they do a scene like that in the movie with his eyes when he just saves princess Charlette and he gets shot by an arrow.  He then gets up and just does that ""stare of your impending doom"" right through a trail in the woods at who he knows was behind the arrow being shot at him.  The animators who drew his eyes and that scene I felt was just an epic scene from the book.  I guess you had to read it, but dang that sent chills down my spine seeing it again!

1576355,A1RMVTKK7AZSE4,B008UE8ICK,Nolan P. Smith,"[0, 1]","If you are a fan of Japanese animation, also known as anime, then you most likely heard of a violent little series called Berserk. A well-known manga (Japanese comic book) and anime, Berserk was created by Kentaro Miura and instantly became a hit. When it was announced that Berserk would be getting the anime treatment once again, fans everywhere were more than thrilled, and yet a little bit worried. Does the first installment of Berserk: The Golden Age leave its mark, or is it simply treading familiar ground?The animated feature, which clocks in with a run time around 100 minutes, hits its mark dead on. Based of the legendary manga series, this first volume introduces the world to Guts (English voice over: Marc Diraison), a young mercenary with a fighting spirit and a massive sword to back it up. In a world of swords, knights and kingdoms, one needs to be able to survive, which is what Guts has done by any means necessary. But when he butts heads with the Band of the Hawk, a fearless group of mercenaries led by the almost unbeatable Griffith (Kevin T. Collins), his whole life changes.The animation is beautifully done by STUDIO4C and licensed in the US by Viz Media, as it has a very distinct, modern feel to it. Very different from the previous anime, which had a dark, gritty feel, this animated feature has some of the best modern day, 2-D animation I have seen to date. The voice cast for the English cast is top notch, as the man who voiced Berserk, Marc Diraison, returns to voice the lone swordsman, and does so effortlessly. The entire voice cast puts out an amazing performance; well worthy of the glorious animation it is paired with.With a name like Guts in an anime called Berserk, you better believe there is plenty of blood and violence to go around, just like its original source material. Having been a fan of the original manga and anime, I am very pleased with this new interpretation of a classic franchise.Highly recommended!",4,The Return of Guts and the World of Berserk!,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,1962,"['are', 'fan', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'also', 'known', 'anime', 'then', 'most', 'likely', 'heard', 'violent', 'little', 'series', 'called', 'Berserk', 'well-known', 'manga', 'Japanese', 'comic', 'book', 'anime', 'Berserk', 'was', 'created', 'Kentaro', 'Miura', 'instantly', 'became', 'hit', 'When', 'was', 'announced', 'Berserk', 'would', 'be', 'getting', 'anime', 'treatment', 'once', 'again', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'were', 'more', 'thrilled', 'yet', 'little', 'bit', 'worried', 'first', 'installment', 'Berserk', 'Golden', 'Age', 'leave', 'mark', 'simply', 'treading', 'familiar', 'ground', 'animated', 'feature', 'run', 'time', '100', 'minutes', 'mark', 'dead', 'Based', 'legendary', 'manga', 'series', 'first', 'volume', 'world', 'Guts', 'English', 'voice', 'Marc', 'Diraison', 'young', 'mercenary', 'fighting', 'spirit', 'massive', 'sword', 'back', 'up', 'world', 'swords', 'knights', 'kingdoms', 'one', 'be', 'able', 'survive', 'what', 'Guts', 'done', 'means', 'necessary', 'when', 'butts', 'heads', 'Band', 'Hawk', 'fearless', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'led', 'almost', 'unbeatable', 'Griffith', 'Kevin', 'T.', 'Collins', 'whole', 'life', 'changes.The', 'animation', 'beautifully', 'done', 'STUDIO4C', 'licensed', 'US', 'Viz', 'Media', 'very', 'distinct', 'modern', 'feel', 'Very', 'different', 'previous', 'anime', 'had', 'dark', 'gritty', 'feel', 'animated', 'feature', 'best', 'modern', 'day', '2-D', 'animation', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'voice', 'cast', 'English', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'man', 'who', 'voiced', 'Berserk', 'Marc', 'Diraison', 'voice', 'lone', 'swordsman', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'entire', 'voice', 'cast', 'out', 'amazing', 'performance', 'well', 'glorious', 'animation', 'paired', 'name', 'Guts', 'anime', 'called', 'Berserk', 'better', 'believe', 'plenty', 'blood', 'violence', 'go', 'around', 'just', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'Having', 'been', 'fan', 'original', 'manga', 'anime', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'new', 'interpretation', 'classic', 'franchise.Highly', 'recommended']",Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King

I saw it at Best Buy last week and I had a friend who was really into the series a few months back, so I figured I'd give it a try and buy it.I watched the first 10 minutes or so when I first bought it to see what I was getting into, and what struck me first was the animation. I didn't like the animation at all in the beginning of the movie so I turned off the Blu-ray player and put it down until today when I finished it. I picked up right where I left off last week and I really enjoyed it past the first 10 minutes of weird animation, and boy was it weird/not very good animation. I'm not sure if I grew more accustom to the animation as I watched the movie but I didn't find it a problem once the movie really got started.I really enjoyed the movie overall though. I won't say anything about it because I don't want to spoil it, this review is mostly about the actual product and the flaws I found with it, but I did greatly enjoy it and will be waiting for the second movie from this series to get released (hopefully) in 2013.The case it comes in is one of the typical, cheap recyclable cases. There is no real extras either. It does come with a small paper for Neon Alley like all other Viz Media releases, and a paper for the Berserk manga series which can be read online.Without giving anything about the actual movie away I would highly suggest this to new fans, I feel it was a good introduction to the world of Berserk. Especially considering all of the original series releases are out of print now I believe, this is the next best thing.The dub is great, all voice actors fit great as far as I am concerned. The final thing I really enjoyed in this movie is how beautiful the bright colors are during the animation when there is an outdoors scene or battle, it really stuck out to me.

After reading the manga I actually like how they ended the anime, but many people felt jarred and slightly confused.To people new to Berserk, I highly recommend you watch the original anime series first.  The manga is very good too, but has been dragged out forever and has a couple lame characters(imo).

1576363,AYP5082JDMAHL,B008UE8ICK,Ryjacork,"[101, 121]","I'm going to start this review with a bit of backstory. This may be a long read but this is Berserk so I'm going to take my time and get this right.The original Berserk anime is infamous for its massive cliffhanger ending. I was never into manga until I watched Berserk, then I simply HAD to read the manga, because I literally could not live with not knowing what happened next. The fact that Berserk is one of the most well drawn and well written (if poorly updated) manga series ever made.For years the fans clamored for season 2, even after it became clear that it wasn't going to happen there were still some hold outs, but eventually even they died out as well. Then the past few years we have started to see a lot of old uncompleted anime series get reboots. Some like Ultimate Hellsing were just what the fans were waiting for, others like Inuyasha: Final Act were rushed and kind of disappointing. But if any anime deserved a reboot, it was Berserk. And now here it is, the long rumored Berserk reboot that we have waited for all this time.Now I'm going to review the actual series itself of Berserk (be patient the movie review is coming).I don't really look at Berserk like a manga, to me it's more like a great work of art, and it reads more like a classic novel that will survive the ages. It's also easily one of the best drawn series I've ever read. The detail Miura puts into his work is spectacular, and his stories are breathtaking. As we follow Guts on his journey we see him go from an aimless wanderer, to a soldier and a friend struggling to find his place in the world, to a revenge driven sociopath fighting his fate as he travels down his dark road, to a man doing his best to heal from the wounds inflicted upon his mind, body, and soul by the dark hand of fate.His journey constantly exposes us to the very best and the very worst of humanity. We see the darkest and most depraved things imaginable happen in these pages, which only makes it all the more heroic when we see the characters we've come to love climb out from the darkness and hold on to their humanity against all odds. Berserk can make you cry one moment and laugh another, look on in horror at a characters depravity then cheer another's heroism.There are really only two negative things I can say about this series. The first is that the updates are very irregular, Kentaro Miura will take very long breaks, and they kind of happen pretty often too. But what can I say; quality takes time, when you take a look at some of the artwork I can see why each page could take an entire day to create.The only other thing isn't really a complaint since I don't have a problem with it, but as a warning to others the series is very dark. There are extremely brutal death scenes, with a lot of gore. There is also a lot of nudity, including some very graphic rape scenes. This series is NOT for the faint of heart, and certainly not for children.Ok on to reviewing this actual movie, Im going to break it down into pros and cons.Pros:- Great quality. The animation is absolutely superb, and the battle scenes were stunning. In particular I want to praise the Guts vs Griffith fight as well as Zodd's transformation. In fact I actually want to praise Zodd's entire scene. The big battle scenes were also warrant mention (although I think I already did that).- Excellent sound track, I loved the music in this movie. I didn't think it would be possible to top the soundtrack for the old anime, but this at least matched it.- Good cast. I used to watch nothing but dubs, but after my girlfriend forced a few subtitled anime on me I've grown a great appreciation for Japanese voice actors and this movie has some great ones. Their also recasting the original VAs for the English dub, which I've always felt was one of the really good English dubs out there. So whether you're watching it subbed or dubbed you should be happy.- The story is very compelling and manages to hold on to the feelings and themes of friendship and loyalty that are present in the original anime and the Golden Age manga arc.- Most importantly to me, it wasn't rushed. Inuyasha: Final Act was clearly rushed, and was a big disappointment to the fans. Covering over two hundred manga chapters in 26 episodes is a disgrace, no matter how pretty the animation is. And I'm happy to say that Berserk did not make that mistake. There were a few scenes that were cut, but nothing important was lost. The most important scenes are still there and are handled well.- This won't break your bank. Most anime is pretty expensive, but fifteen dollars (seventeen blu ray) is pretty good, especially for a movie that clearly had a very high animation budget.Cons:- While it wasn't rushed there are a few scenes that were left out. Most notably Guts' childhood is just covered in a series of flashbacks that don't explain much. While this didn't bug me, there might be a bit lost for those who haven't read the manga or seen the original anime.- This is my main gripe, and the only thing that made me consider giving this less than a perfect five star rating. There are a few times during the CGI battle scenes where some of the characters faces get this kind of cheesy PlayStation 2 graphics look. It happens a few times during the opening castle siege, and once or twice during Guts' fight with Casca (that was what really bugged me because it was such an important scene). It didn't happen so often that it ruined the movie though, and the fans have been vocal enough about it that I'm sure it will be cleaned up for future movies.So all in all this is a quality product. A great movie for old Berserk fans or newer people just coming to the series. I own the original Box of War anime set, as well as the remastered version, and every volume of the manga. I'll be proud come November to add this to my collection.",5,Amazing Reboot,1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,5856,"[""'m"", 'going', 'start', 'review', 'bit', 'backstory', 'may', 'be', 'long', 'read',

Cowen,"[0, 0]","The red is a lot to like about this adaptation on the manga in movie form.The animation is excellent and well drawn.it looks much better than the anime series. Their is some nice looking CGI.I would also commend them on the quality of the voice actors. My understanding is that it uses some of the voice actors from the anime series.The show is dark,violent and just as bloody and violence as the manga or anime.There is plenty of action,intrigue and likable characters.People who who like sword and sorcery type fantasy may love this.As a fan who is really into beserk it was nice to see something done with on the animation side of things.I do have a few issues with this however. While the CGI is pretty good I could have done without it to be honest.The back ground music is forgettable in my opinion.The anime series have very good back ground music that I actually still have on my mp3 player even now. I am surprised they could not have done better in this area or at least used the anime series background music.One huge problem is the amount of time they have is not enough to go over the largest amount of materia they have to cover. Because of this the film's rushes through certain events quickly.Personally it might have been better to just leave some things out rather than fly through them. The fast pace hurts when it comes to developing an attachment to the characters and understanding all of the little plots and issues going on with the story line. My biggest complaint is that it is going over material that was covered in the anime series already. The majority of people who will be Watching this are most likely fans who have been eating to finally see material after the eclipse.They could have skipped all of this as far as I am concerned as the anime series dealt with this part of the manga better.In all worth buying for fans of the manga and people that like this type of entertainment. For fans looking for new material it may not be worth it to be honest.For newer fans I would suggest watching a friend's copy of this and buying the anime series as it does the portion of the manga far better than this does. I would not have purchased this is I was not such a big fan of beserk and wanted to support it. My suggestion is to get the film's and and anime series together for a better understanding for new fans.

1576366,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B008UE8ICK,Sebastian Fernandez,"[0, 0]","I am one of those people that found out about Berserk through the original anime series, and as a result ended up following the story through the manga after that, actually reading it from the beginning. In the last few years I have been hoping that someone would decide to continue the anime, and when I found out about this new project I was happy, even though I knew that the story would start back from the start.Even though I have already experienced the events in this film through both the anime and the manga, there was plenty for me to like here. I found the graphics to be very crisp and vivid. The characters are portrayed accurately and the mood of the series is respected. Some scenes, like Guts confrontation with Zodd are above and beyond what we have experienced in the past.The only reason why I am taking a star away is because they did not have time to provide as much detail as in the anime series. Therefore, for those people that have not experienced Berserk in the past, it will probably be a challenge to understand everything that is going on. On the other side, it will probably make them want to find out more and watching the original series and reading the manga is a very good idea.I am looking forward to the next movie, and I hope that there are many more after that so we get to see the story continue in this format.",4,Must watch for Berserk fans,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,1350,"['am', 'one', 'people', 'found', 'out', 'Berserk', 'original', 'anime', 'series', 'result', 'ended', 'up', 'following', 'story', 'manga', 'actually', 'reading', 'beginning', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'hoping', 'someone', 'would', 'decide', 'continue', 'anime', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'new', 'project', 'was', 'happy', 'even', 'knew', 'story', 'would', 'start', 'back', 'start.Even', 'have', 'already', 'experienced', 'events', 'film', 'anime', 'manga', 'was', 'plenty', 'like', 'here', 'found', 'graphics', 'be', 'very', 'crisp', 'vivid', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'accurately', 'mood', 'series', 'respected', 'scenes', 'Guts', 'confrontation', 'Zodd', 'are', 'what', 'have', 'experienced', 'past.The', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'am', 'taking', 'star', 'away', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'provide', 'much', 'detail', 'anime', 'series', 'Therefore', 'people', 'have', 'not', 'experienced', 'Berserk', 'past', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'challenge', 'understand', 'everything', 'going', 'other', 'side', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'watching', 'original', 'series', 'reading', 'manga', 'very', 'good', 'idea.I', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'movie', 'hope', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'so', 'get', 'see', 'story', 'continue', 'format']",Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King
1576367,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B008UE8ICK,Stephen M. Lerch,"[5, 10]","Short review - if you're a fan of Berserk, this version is definitely worth picking up and includes high quality video. If you have no prior experience with Berserk, maybe find the TV series or read the Manga first if you want to ""get it"" completely.It's also bloody and violent, with a brief nip of nudity, so not for children. At all.Berserk - The Golden Age Arc 1 is a retelling of the original Anime. The original Anime was a compressed and slightly different version of the original Manga. Essentially they boiled down some of the Manga to make the original TV series from 1997, then boiled down the Anime to fit it into a trilogy of movies. This is the first of the trilogy.In terms of the story, there is a lot of characterization missing. This isn't the kind of movie you will pop in and have someone watching with you and have them completely understand it. It's clearly made for fans of the series, who will already understand it. This is good and bad. Good because it assumes you know the characters. Bad because I don't think it'll easily make new fans. The battle with Zodd should have felt a little more epic in my opinion, but was done in about 5 minutes tops.Video-The BD quality is very high. No compression issues. No sound problems. I assume it's all come from digital sources and as such, is pristine.Audio-You can choose Japanese DTS or English DTS, with optional English subtitles.My biggest disappointment with the film is here. Not because the audio quality is bad. It isn't - coming from recent digital sources, it would take real buffoons to screw this up. No, my disappointment is with the Japanese casting. Nobutoshi Hayashi is Guts for me. He did the voice in the original TV series. He did the voice on the Dreamcast game. He did the voice on the PS2 game. He IS Guts. Except, not in this version. They've found someone with a sort of similar voice, but it's not the same. Toshiyuki Morikawa is Griffith. But again, not in this film. I could almost accept the voice change for any other characters in the movie, just not them. I believe they used a different casting company, which is why we hear OTHER famous Japanese seiyuu voicing the characters.And don't get me wrong, the Japanese actors do a good job conveying emotion and lending the characters voice. It's just different, and in some things, different is hard to accept.BUT on the awesome side, I believe they've pull the entire English voice cast back into the action! And they do as good a job, or maybe a bit better, than they did with the original TV series! This is really cool on Viz/Warner Brother's part, and they should be commended for the extra effort. Kudos!Both tracks are DTS 5.1 and have great separation.Extras-Uh... what extras? Essentially there are none. You get a trailer for NeonAlley, and nothing more. Was hoping for SOMETHING else, ANYTHING else, but no. Nothing. It would have at least been cool to get some behind the scenes for say, the English language dialog recording. Instead, we get a trailer. The Japanese release appears to have included Japanese vocal cast extras and a trailer or something for Arc 2. We don't get either on this release.Packaging-Typical Blu Ray case. Cover art is the same as the Japanese release (mostly). We don't get the cardboard slipcover artwork, but we do still get a re-rendering of the Japanese cover, which is nice.One thing to note is that the animation is what I'd describe as 3D animation, similar to Pixar films, except cell shaded, like some video games, to look more like traditional animation. The effect is sometimes subtle, sometimes completely in your face. It's nicely done, though my personal preference is standard 2D. With it being 3D, some of the animation isn't as fluid as I would like, but that's the current form of 3D and really doesn't detract from the film.Overall, this is a high quality release, in terms of audio/video of a show that will definitely appeal to current fans. Recommended for fans. New comers, recommended after you see the original TV series or read the Manga.",5,"Great BD release, light on extras",1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,4052,"['Short', 'review', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Berserk', 'version', 'definitely', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'high', 'quality', 'video', 'have', 'prior', 'experience', 'Berserk', 'maybe', 'find', 'TV', 'series', 'read', 'Manga', 'first', 'want', 'get', 'completely.It', 'also', 'bloody', 'violent', 'brief', 'nip', 'nudity', 'not', 'children', 'all.Berserk', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Arc', '1', 'retelling', 'original', 'Anime', 'original', 'Anime', 'was', 'compressed', 'slightly', 'different', 'version', 'original', 'Manga', 'Essentially', 'boiled', 'down', 'Manga', 'make', 'original', 'TV', 'series', '1997', 'then', 'boiled', 'down', 'Anime', 'fit', 'trilogy', 'movies', 'first', 'trilogy.In', 'terms', 'story', 'lot', 'characterization', 'missing', ""n't"", 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'pop', 'have', 'someone', 'watching', 'have', 'completely', 'understand', 'clearly', 'made', 'fans', 'series', 'who', 'will', 'already', 'understand', 'good', 'bad', 'Good', 'know', 'characters', 'Bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'easily', 'make', 'new', 'fans', 'battle', 'Zodd', 'should', 'have', 'felt', 'little', 'more', 'epic', 'opinion', 'was', 'done', 'about', '5', 'minutes', 'tops.Video-The', 'BD', 'quality', 'very', 'high', 'compression', 'issues', 'sound', 'problems', 'assume', 'come', 'digital', 'sources', 'such', 'pristine.Audio-You', 'can', 'choose', 'Japanese', 'DTS', 'English', 'DTS', 'optional', 'English', 'subtitles.My', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'film', 'here', 'Not', 'audio', 'quality', 'bad', ""n't"", 'coming', 'recent', 'digital', 'sources', 'would', 'take', 'real', 'buffoons', 'screw', 'up', 'No', 'disappointment', 'Japanese', 'casting', 'Nobutoshi', 'Hayashi', 'Guts', 'did', 'voice', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'did', 'voice', 'Dreamcast', 'game', 'did', 'voice', 'PS2', 'game', 'Guts', 'Except', 'not', 'version', ""'ve"", 'found', 'someone', 'sort', 'similar', 'voice', 'not', 'same', 'Toshiyuki', 'Morikawa', 'Griffith', 'again', 'not', 'film', 'could', 'almost', 'accept', 'voice', 'change', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'believe', 'used', 'different', 'casting', 'company', 'why', 'hear', 'OTHER', 'famous', 'Japanese', 'seiyuu', 'voicing', 'characters.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'emotion', 'lending', 'characters', 'voice', 'just', 'different', 'things', 'different', 'hard', 'accept.BUT', 'awesome', 'side', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'pull', 'entire', 'English', 'voice', 'cast', 'back', 'action', 'do', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'maybe', 'bit', 'better', 'did', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'really', 'cool', 'Viz/Warner', 'Brother', 'part', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'extra', 'effort', 'Kudos', 'tracks', 'are', 'DTS', '5.1', 'have', 'great', 'separation.Extras-Uh', 'what', 'extras', 'Essentially', 'are', 'none', 'get', 'trailer', 'NeonAlley', 'nothing', 'more', 'Was', 'hoping', 'SOMETHING', 'else', 'ANYTHING', 'else', 'Nothing', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'been', 'cool', 'get', 'scenes', 'say', 'English', 'language', 'dialog', 'recording', 'Instead', 'get', 'trailer', 'Japanese', 'release', 'have', 'included', 'Japanese', 'vocal', 'cast', 'extras', 'trailer', 'something', 'Arc', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'either', 'release.Packaging-Typical', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'case', 'Cover', 'art', 'same', 'Japanese', 'release', 'mostly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'cardboard', 'slipcover', 'artwork', 'do', 'still', 'get', 're-rendering', 'Japanese', 'cover', 'nice.One', 'thing', 'note', 'animation', 'what', ""'d"", 'describe', '3D', 'animation', 'similar', 'Pixar', 'films', 'cell', 'shaded', 'video', 'games', 'look', 'more', 'traditional', 'animation', 'effect', 'sometimes', 'subtle', 'sometimes', 'completely', 'face', 'nicely', 'done', 'personal', 'preference', 'standard', '2D', 'being', '3D', 'animation', ""n't"", 'as', 'fluid', 'would', 'like', 'current', 'form', '3D', 'really', ""n't"", 'detract', 'film.Overall', 'high', 'quality', 'release', 'terms', 'audio/video', 'show', 'will', 'definitely', 'appeal', 'current', 'fans', 'Recommended', 'fans', 'New', 'comers', 'recommended', 'see', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'read', 'Manga']",Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King

1576372,A1SLYHT5EQTJGO,B008UE8ICK,watkd25,"[0, 1]","It's good to know that the creator of the anime series paid attention to his fans and coordinated with a studio to finish off what he orignally started; even though it took ten years!If you have watched the original anime, you will know what I am talking about.The original is meticulous and what I like about the series is that it shows human nature in a very precise manner, the storyline is touching, and the art work is amazing (This is coming from someone who is not artistically inclined and does not watch cartoons).With that said, this new anime is good, but not as good as I had desperately anticipated.  In some respects this video feels a little bit rushed.  This first part of the new trilogy has several of the old animes compressed into this new version.  (I don't remember off of the top of my head how many, I think its three).  Some of the grammar is not correct, which is not a big deal.  I wish that they created this like the old anime, I cannot stress how good the artwork is in it.This implies that you miss out on some of the details that the original had.It's still a good video, if you were like me and saw the original anime seven times and are very desperate to see what happens, I would hold off until at least until the second video comes out.Some day, I will read all of the comics that the series is based off of.  I believe it has been in publication since 1990.If you are wanting to watch this for the first time, I recommend watching the old version first.  If you don't like cliffhangers, then wait until the second video comes out or the trilogy is completed.The series is definitely not for kids!",4,Not as good as its predecessor,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,1633,"['good', 'know', 'creator', 'anime', 'series', 'paid', 'attention', 'fans', 'coordinated', 'studio', 'finish', 'off', 'what', 'orignally', 'started', 'even', 'took', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'watched', 'original', 'anime', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'original', 'meticulous', 'what', 'like', 'series', 'human', 'nature', 'very', 'precise', 'manner', 'storyline', 'touching', 'art', 'work', 'amazing', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'artistically', 'inclined', 'not', 'watch', 'cartoons', '.With', 'said', 'new', 'anime', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'had', 'desperately', 'anticipated', 'respects', 'video', 'little', 'bit', 'rushed', 'first', 'part', 'new', 'trilogy', 'several', 'old', 'animes', 'compressed', 'new', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'top', 'head', 'how', 'many', 'think', 'three', 'grammar', 'not', 'correct', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'wish', 'created', 'old', 'anime', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'how', 'good', 'artwork', 'it.This', 'implies', 'miss', 'out', 'details', 'original', 'had.It', 'still', 'good', 'video', 'were', 'saw', 'original', 'anime', 'seven', 'times', 'are', 'very', 'desperate', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'hold', 'off', 'least', 'second', 'video', 'out.Some', 'day', 'will', 'read', 'comics', 'series', 'based', 'believe', 'been', 'publication', '1990.If', 'are', 'wanting', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'recommend', 'watching', 'old', 'version', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'cliffhangers', 'then', 'wait', 'second', 'video', 'out', 'trilogy', 'completed.The', 'series', 'definitely', 'not', 'kids']",Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King

It doesn't bother me that it leaves a lot of material from the manga out because well, it's not the manga.  Also I think the CG integrated into the animation does not look bad one bit.  Of course it would be nice if it followed the manga step by step but then there would have to be double digit amount of movies which obviously isn't going to happen.

I'd have to watch it again but I don't believe it lacks anything that the manga or TV series had.  The animation quality is amazing, and the English voices are great!  The TV series had a lot of skipping and cutting, this film filters that out and follows more closely the original narrative.  Great for new fans, and if they want to see the TV series episodes then they can skip some episodes.  For us long time fans it is great to see an improved version!",5,Duly impressed!,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,551,"['was', 'waiting', 'saw', 'coming', 'kept', 'asking', 'internet', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'out', 'yet', ""'d"", 'have', 'watch', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anything', 'manga', 'TV', 'series', 'had', 'animation', 'quality', 'amazing', 'English', 'voices', 'are', 'great', 'TV', 'series', 'had', 'lot', 'skipping', 'cutting', 'film', 'filters', 'out', 'more', 'closely', 'original', 'narrative', 'Great', 'new', 'fans', 'want', 'see', 'TV', 'series', 'episodes', 'then', 'can', 'skip', 'episodes', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'great', 'see', 'improved', 'version']",Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King
