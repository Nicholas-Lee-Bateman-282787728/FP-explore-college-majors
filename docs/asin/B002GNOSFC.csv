1267726,A32U6577WUD9L5,B002GNOSFC,"Donald James. Parker ""Author""","[0, 0]","Talk about a major flashback. Half of this story takes place in the past as the hero has to consider that he might be like his father - and if so does not want to jeopardize ruining the life of his true love. Gritty and edgy scenes of teenage reality combined with the innocence of childhood and the navet&eacute; of seekers of true love present an interesting contrast. An interesting confrontation between father and son put me through a emotional tug of war. It was evident that both parties were the victim of divorce. It was also very obvious that people can't live in the past and dwell on prior hurts if they wish to lead productive and satisfying lives. The content was obviously not constructed to impress the Dove folks, since there are several scenes that will cause them to use their red pen, though there was nothing that caused me to throw a flag.",4,Turning the hearts of the fathers to the sons,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,861,"['Talk', 'major', 'flashback', 'Half', 'story', 'place', 'past', 'hero', 'consider', 'might', 'be', 'father', 'so', 'not', 'want', 'jeopardize', 'ruining', 'life', 'true', 'love', 'Gritty', 'edgy', 'scenes', 'teenage', 'reality', 'combined', 'innocence', 'childhood', 'navet', 'eacute', 'seekers', 'true', 'love', 'present', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'interesting', 'confrontation', 'father', 'son', 'put', 'emotional', 'tug', 'war', 'was', 'evident', 'parties', 'were', 'victim', 'divorce', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'obvious', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'past', 'dwell', 'prior', 'hurts', 'wish', 'lead', 'productive', 'satisfying', 'lives', 'content', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'constructed', 'impress', 'Dove', 'folks', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'will', 'cause', 'use', 'red', 'pen', 'was', 'nothing', 'caused', 'throw', 'flag']",N/A

1267729,A2QE9AL0DEJOUG,B002GNOSFC,RedCheckLady,"[0, 0]",The best part of this movie was the incerpts from the past--both my husband and I enjoyed that and thought if they would have just made a movie about what all happened in the past then bring it all to present day at the end--would have been the best. As it is right now--it is a agonizingly SLOW. My husband hated all the music --i understand they used that instead of conversation. I ended up fast forwarding some of the scenes of just music--it was just to drawn out and slow. Also--this movie held very little meaning for me. I personally only see a person getting something from this movie --if --thy come from a split home(divorce) and /or drinking of a parent. Since there was not any of that in my family -it was hard for me to &#34;get into&#34; the movie.Also the main character (dan) kind of seems like a &#34;wuss&#34; to me. My husband had to agree slightly on that point--he could not see a grown man puking and cryng like that--made him sissy-fied.I was going to give this a 3 star but my opinion is not the same as yours. There was some good things about this movie --if you are the right person.There is no sex or cursing in this movie. You do see the use of alcohol but --it is shown in a negative manner and in no way promotes the use of it.,3,AGONIZINGLY SLOW MOVING MOVIE,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,1259,"['best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'incerpts', 'past', 'husband', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'made', 'movie', 'what', 'happened', 'past', 'then', 'bring', 'present', 'day', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'right', 'now', 'agonizingly', 'SLOW', 'husband', 'hated', 'music', 'i', 'understand', 'used', 'instead', 'conversation', 'ended', 'up', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'scenes', 'just', 'music', 'was', 'just', 'drawn', 'out', 'slow', 'Also', 'movie', 'held', 'very', 'little', 'meaning', 'personally', 'only', 'see', 'person', 'getting', 'something', 'movie', 'thy', 'come', 'split', 'home', 'divorce', '/or', 'drinking', 'parent', 'was', 'not', 'family', '-it', 'was', 'hard', '34', 'get', '34', 'movie.Also', 'main', 'character', 'dan', 'kind', '34', 'wuss', '34', 'husband', 'had', 'agree', 'slightly', 'point', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'grown', 'man', 'puking', 'cryng', 'made', 'sissy-fied.I', 'was', 'going', 'give', '3', 'star', 'opinion', 'not', 'same', 'yours', 'was', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'right', 'person.There', 'sex', 'cursing', 'movie', 'do', 'see', 'use', 'alcohol', 'shown', 'negative', 'manner', 'way', 'use']",N/A

Following in the tradition of films like Fireproof, A Letter To Dad is shot on a lower budget but carries an impressive cast (John Ashton, Paul Gleason, Mario Van Peebles). It starts a little slow and may seem after the first ten minutes like this will be a series of extended music video segments.  However, once Dan's father Mike starts reading his son's letter and begins reflecting on the past, the film soars and never drops.This touches on an unfortunately common case in today's society.  However, it needs to be seen and will be a blessing not only for broken families but for all.
