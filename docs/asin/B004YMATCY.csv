So, to only be 85 some, something had to be removed - and I do not plan to buy a poor copy to find out what..

I gave it three stars only because it shows ample good veiws of bissets big firm naked breasts. The main plot was not very believable. It is a boring drawn out drama set all in one afternoon meeting a guy who is a stranger & leading up to the act of adultery. It is a full screen version that cuts off more of the edges than a normal full screen dvd.,3,transfer,1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,448,"['transfer', 'not', 'best', 'little', 'focus', 'was', 'transfered', 'good', 'vhs', 'gave', 'three', 'only', 'ample', 'good', 'veiws', 'bissets', 'big', 'firm', 'naked', 'breasts', 'main', 'plot', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'boring', 'drawn', 'drama', 'set', 'one', 'afternoon', 'meeting', 'guy', 'who', 'stranger', 'leading', 'up', 'act', 'adultery', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'more', 'edges', 'normal', 'full', 'screen', 'dvd']",Secrets

As another reviewer stated, Jacqueline Bisset was the drawing card. I first saw the film shortly after it was theatrically released and bits of it kept coming alive in my mind. What was in the 6 minutes I didn't get? All three family members have affairs of their own without the other's knowledge. Who was the gent that took Judy home after she helped him at the laundromat? I never heard his name mentioned at any time. I don't know if it was Raymond or Dominic. And by that reasoning, who was the other guy? I'm not really happy with this non-revelation. If their names were revealed somewhere in the film, at what point were they mentioned? In their way the separate affairs shed new light on the lives they were currently living in. And it being on DVD-R there were no features.Secrets",3,"The awaited film ""Secrets""",1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,890,"['film', 'only', '85:43', 'length', 'opposed', '92', 'minutes', 'promised', 'DVD-R', 'case', 'packaging', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'was', 'drawing', 'card', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'shortly', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'bits', 'kept', 'coming', 'alive', 'mind', 'What', 'was', '6', 'minutes', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'three', 'family', 'members', 'have', 'affairs', 'own', 'other', 'knowledge', 'Who', 'was', 'gent', 'took', 'Judy', 'home', 'helped', 'laundromat', 'never', 'heard', 'name', 'mentioned', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Raymond', 'Dominic', 'reasoning', 'who', 'was', 'other', 'guy', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'happy', 'non-revelation', 'names', 'were', 'revealed', 'somewhere', 'film', 'what', 'point', 'were', 'mentioned', 'way', 'separate', 'affairs', 'shed', 'new', 'light', 'lives', 'were', 'currently', 'living', 'being', 'DVD-R', 'were', 'features.Secrets']",Secrets
