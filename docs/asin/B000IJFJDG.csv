1021270,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B000IJFJDG,,"[4, 4]","I rarely watch documentaries about fans of a particular motion picture or motion picture genre. I don't consider myself as a Trekkie or a Star Wars fanatic, but after watching Firefly and Serenity I wanted to know more. I wanted to see more of what the fuss was about. I now consider myself a Browncoat.Done the Impossible: The Fans Tale of Firefly and Serenity is a unique feature. It was made by and stars the fans of Joss Whedon's franchise Firefly. More than a fan produced film it is a record of the grass roots activism of a small but growing group of fans who would not let the show they loved die and their work influenced Universal Pictures to turn their love into the motion picture Serenity.The film is hosted by Adam Baldwin and it follows the fans from Con to Con from screening to screening. It exhibits such joy that the viewer cannot help but be moved.The disc is one of the most jam packed single disc editions that I have ever seen. Broken into two parts: the DVD and the DVD-Rom there are almost 15 hours of material. The DVD includes an interactive timeline of the show, trivia games, charity spots, music videos, and five easter eggs. The DVD-Rom portion includes a completely interactive viewing experience that includes transcripts, extended interviews and biographies. All this material is fully searchable and is a lot of fun.If you are a fan of Firefly and Serenity do yourself a favor and seek this one out.

Their common question was, ""The show was so good they cancelled it?"" It still resonates. I don't know anyone who doesn't like Firefly.When I show the series to someone today, they wonder aloud, 'why was it cancelled?'We got top notch entertainment for three months and made friends for life with strangers we see only at conventions. The point of this documentary is that people can come together over a common interest.As fans of a TV show that lasted only 13 episodes, we proved that there was an audience for it and that the network was WRONG for killing it. The fans are the reason the movie ""Serenity"" was made.Yes. We did the impossible. And that makes us mighty.Years later, most of the cast have their own TV shows, the writers are still creating and Joss Whedon is the director of one of the biggest movies of all time.So, maybe the fans knew what they were talking about.This is a time capsule.Fans in this film are still fans today.Whedon and crew made an impact on many lives with their message of family and independence.""When you can't run, you crawl.

She knew little of it other than she heard it was good and thought I'd like it. She was right in spades.Here's the scoop. This documentary takes you through the inception of the series through the viewer anticipation, Fox screwing it up big time, Fox cancelling it and the fans working their butts off to keep it alive. Then it delves into the fans' final triumph.I did learn some things about ""Firefly"" over the years. Particularly Fox's showing the episodes out of sequence. I thought this was odd. Were they TRYING to fail?! But I had no idea how strongly the fans felt about the cancellation and all that went on behind the scenes involving the efforts of them trying to get the show back. You get to hear from Joss Whedon, the actors, crew, editors and most everybody involved in the production along with their experience working on it and the subsequent, overwhelming outpouring of love, support and effort to keep it all going.I was dumbstruck. At one end it all sounds a little ""Star Trek"" silly. After all, it is only a TV show. But then I got to realize that it was also a vision. Who of us doesn't feel put out because of government intrusion? Every time you pay extra for something you feel should already be covered by your taxes and maybe once was. And the government keeps stacking it on so you want to board the ship with Malcolm Reynolds, one of the coolest characters ever, and head off where you won't be bothered?Watching these fans being interviewed really effected me. There seem like some of the greatest people ever. I wanted to be with them. Drink with them. Talk with them and play music with them. I've come to realize in my waning years that people can get along just fine with one another. It's government that drives rifts between us and screws things up.

That was the worst DVD I have ever bought. It simply showed the Star Wars fans that most Star Wars fans are afraid will be seen in public and stigmatize them to the rest of the world. Just a bunch of people cussing who needed to grow up.Done The Impossible couldn't be more the opposite of Star Wait. It was very professionally done by people who loved Firefly. People who loved the show so much that they wanted to share it with those who haven't seen Firefly or Serenity.It was great to see some of the actors get in on the action and help out. That gave the video much more credibility than it would have had otherwise. We were shown actors who really loved what they were doing and wholeheartedly appreciated the fans for their support. Most actors wouldn't have stooped so low as to thank their audience.I am a Firefly fan. I am a Serenity fan. I became a fan too late to get in on the guerrilla marketing and writing campaigns. But if you are any kind of fan at all, you should buy this DVD.

Moved along swiftly with chapters starting with clever and appropriate series quotes in white print on full black screen.  For example, Jayne's ""Time for some thrilling heroics"". Almost no duplication of special features from the Firefly and Serenity DVD to the best of my recollection.  Adam Baldwin was surprisingly easy to believe as a serious host even though his character in the movie is very different. I had to laugh when he says that some ""fan fiction is kind of creepy"".  Could he mean some of the Jayne/Mal or Jayne/Simon ""slash"" fiction out there?  I am also wondering why ""Simon"" and ""River"" didn't appear more.The DVD-ROM special features require Apple Quicktime. That's a shame, because everytime I've installed quicktime, I've regretted it when I tried to remove it.  It's like a boot sector virus and won't go fully away. I don't install it anymore regardless of the temptation. Why not provide a Windows solution?[Added 14Apr07:  I withdraw this objection as commenters note that Qtime is freely available on both Macs and Windows platforms so is a valid choice.  Also, for those who do not like Apple's Qtime, commenters point out a great alternative, QuickTimeAlt.]I'm not really a ""browncoat"" as the Serenity and Firefly fans call themselves, but do like the series and movie.  I really enjoyed the documentary since it showed the cast and crew ""off-screen"" and you got the feeling that this team put their hearts and souls into the series and the movie.

1021296,AOE0XMITAJWDT,B000IJFJDG,Terry Sunday,"[345, 348]","First, I have a confession to make. Unlike many ""Firefly"" fans, I had never even heard of Joss Whedon when the show premiered on Fox in the Fall of 2002. I was not a member of the existing ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" fan base that anxiously awaited Whedon's latest offering--I had never seen either show. I did enjoy ""Firefly"" for the brief time that it aired (although I missed a few episodes), but I didn't really appreciate it until it was too late. I didn't get hooked until after I bought the complete series DVD set and saw ""Serenity"" on the big screen.I was a little hesitant about buying ""Done the Impossible"" at first, since I didn't think a ""fan-produced"" DVD could possibly have much to offer. Was I ever wrong! Every ""Firefly"" fan should have this. It may be a little too deep, esoteric or complicated for a casual viewer who just happened to catch a couple of episodes, or for someone who went to see ""Serenity"" for lack of something else to do. But if you've invested the time and energy to watch all of the episodes repeatedly, to learn the culture and terminology of the `Verse, to read the ""Companion"" books--then you need ""Done the Impossible.""The main feature of the DVD portion of the single-sided disk is a 79-minute documentary, with scene selections, that tells the story of the rise and fall of ""Firefly."" There's also an ultra-cool interactive audio/video timeline, a `Verse dictionary (in very small print that's a little hard to read on a normal-size television), a trivia game, commentaries, some music videos and other extras. Presented in a very clever multi-window format, the DVD/ROM portion has over six hours of  interviews, commentaries, music, factoids, biographies of cast, crew and fans, you name it. If it has to do with the birth, death and resurrection of the spaceship ""Serenity"" and her crew, you'll probably find it here. It's very interactive (as is the DVD). You won't just sit back and let this play, because the slick, professional interface practically forces you to click your way around the screen to see what you can find. It's a great way to present the material, but it does require some effort and concentration.Both the DVD and DVD/ROM have first-class production values that equal or exceed any other DVD I've ever seen. Even if you're not a certified, died-in-the-wool ""Browncoat,"" you should consider buying ""Done the Impossible."" It tells a unique story that you won't find anywhere else.
