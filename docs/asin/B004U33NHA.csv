The dialogue is up front, center mostly, where it belongs, and the surround is panned nicely for elements such as the whip-pan sound effect, off-camera dialogue, and passing vehicles. In certain locations, however--in the Ruby or the bar at the Hotel, outside the Leroys' house or Corner Gas itself--the surround mix really places you in the scene with customer chatter and background music playing (though each setting seems to have its own same song playing each time we're there) or birds chirping.If part of the charm of this excellent series is its sense of place--and if you need to own the DVDs, clearly a place you want to visit time and again--the audio on these discs is to be highly commended, best of any I've heard this side of &#34;Community.&#34;",5,The other reviewers cover it nicely,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,853,"['So', 'just', 'wanted', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'wonderful', '5.1', 'surround', 'mix', 'entire', 'series', 'dialogue', 'up', 'front', 'center', 'mostly', 'where', 'surround', 'panned', 'nicely', 'elements', 'such', 'whip-pan', 'sound', 'effect', 'off-camera', 'dialogue', 'passing', 'vehicles', 'certain', 'locations', 'however', 'Ruby', 'bar', 'Hotel', 'Leroys', 'house', 'Corner', 'Gas', 'surround', 'mix', 'really', 'scene', 'customer', 'chatter', 'background', 'music', 'playing', 'setting', 'have', 'own', 'same', 'song', 'playing', 'time', ""'re"", 'birds', 'chirping.If', 'part', 'charm', 'excellent', 'series', 'sense', 'place', 'need', 'own', 'DVDs', 'clearly', 'place', 'want', 'visit', 'time', 'again', 'audio', 'discs', 'be', 'highly', 'commended', 'best', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'side', '34', 'Community.', '34']",Corner Gas - The Complete Series Box Set

1427991,AYVQMWDUSGL2C,B004U33NHA,jude pepper,"[3, 3]","i'm from Utah, so when it comes to Canadian comedy (meaning comedy as it pertains to what it's like to be Canadian), my frame of reference pretty much consists of Bob & Doug McKenzie. (not that STRANGE BREW isn't still funny.) or it did until a couple of springs ago, when i discovered that at that time, WGN was airing a sitcom from from the Great White North called CORNER GAS a couple of midnights a week. i figured that since i was already a fan of a few ""Britcoms,"" what did i have to lose?CORNER GAS is the brainchild of a stand-up comedian named Brent Butt. (with a name like that, what else was he gonna be? a brain surgeon?) legend has it that one day Butt found himself pondering what his life might've been if he'd never gone on the road. the next thing he knew, he found himself creating, then playing, the proprietor of the sole gas station in the rural Saskatchewan provence of Dog River, which is located (literally, not figuratively) in the middle of nowhere.Dog River is easiest to describe as Mayberry filtered through The Twilight Zone. (or is that just me and my American's-eye-view?) it's a fairly typical small town, but events and obsessions can get bizarre. let the competition worry about pregnancies, bankruptcies, the ""big"" questions. this is a series where plots hang on weightier issues like whether the police can get free coffee, one woman's determination to write her name in the fresh cement, and the quest to erect a tourist attraction: The World's Biggest Hoe.joining Butt in his carbon-copy of his hometown are a delightfully quirky cast. a snarky Corner Gas employee who divides her time pretty much evenly between being facetious and qualifying for Mensa. a ""new"" girl in town (she inherited the cafe from her aunt) who's so busy worrying about not fitting in that she completely forgets not to fit in. a police force consisting of a dedicated, studious rookie, and a flighty, often childlike senior officer. a village idiot who makes The Three Stooges look like rocket scientists. (on one memorable occasion, he replies to every statement, including the inquiry as to whether he really understands the joke, with ""that's what she said."") and then there's Butt's parents: a father who sets a new standard for the crotchety old fart stereotype, and the most loving, devoted wife ever to come within repeated hairsbreadths of ripping her husband to shreds.is CORNER GAS the greatest sitcom Canada has ever produced? i'm tempted to say so, but i'm not sure i'm qualified to make that call. it's the ONLY Canadian television series i've ever heard of, so i can't attest to just how stiff it's competition might've been. (indeed, i can't even testify, in a court of law, that there WAS competition.) so it would be roughly analagous to describing Satan as the greatest Prince Of Darkness of all time.aw, heck with it. i hereby go On The Record as saying that CORNER GAS is the greatest Canadian sitcom of all time.

The cast of characters from a fictional small town in Saskatchewan may well represent folks from Anytown, USA. In fact, six of the actors hail from the Canadian province. No laugh track - you are the laugh track. Deadpan comedy, zingers, and making fun of everyday life are what this show is about.

1428001,A22EELSB22SPEX,B004U33NHA,"Terry Weiss ""Mystery Lover""","[0, 0]","We bought the whole series after watching seasons 3 and 4 on an online dvd rental site (don't want Amazon to bump this review by putting the name of the site in the review.) We have no regrets , not one. It's delightful entertainment, often laugh out loud, certainly plenty of chuckles. It's perfect for those of us who can't get to sleep after watching serious dramas with lots of blood, gore, and ickiness - you can have a darned nice evening of fun, and then sleep without nightmares. We love it, and even though if we'd waited, we would have spent a lot less for it, it's still been worth it. It's sort of Seinfeld on the Saskatchewan prairie. Highly recommend. Only thing I would have changed is at the end of the last season, when the futures of the characters are given (life after Corner Gas) I think Lacy and Brent should have gotten married. It would have been a marriage worthy of his parents. Makes me laugh thinking about it.",5,Just plain funny and entertaining,1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,938,"['bought', 'whole', 'series', 'watching', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'online', 'dvd', 'rental', 'site', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Amazon', 'bump', 'review', 'putting', 'name', 'site', 'review', 'have', 'regrets', 'not', 'one', 'delightful', 'entertainment', 'often', 'out', 'loud', 'certainly', 'plenty', 'chuckles', 'perfect', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'sleep', 'watching', 'serious', 'dramas', 'lots', 'blood', 'gore', 'ickiness', 'can', 'have', 'darned', 'nice', 'evening', 'fun', 'then', 'sleep', 'nightmares', 'love', 'even', ""'d"", 'waited', 'would', 'have', 'spent', 'lot', 'less', 'still', 'been', 'worth', 'sort', 'Seinfeld', 'Saskatchewan', 'prairie', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'Only', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'when', 'futures', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'life', 'Corner', 'Gas', 'think', 'Lacy', 'Brent', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'married', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'marriage', 'worthy', 'parents', 'Makes', 'thinking']",Corner Gas - The Complete Series Box Set
