Tears streamed from my eyes last night as the beautiful final scene filled the screen. We were all watching it, from my husband to the youngest, and we were all delighted in it.I don't think I knew much about Saint Philip Neri beforehand although his name is so very familiar.  He is not a great saint of great accomplishments or great written treaties. He did not travel and his intellect did not shine above others.What was great about him? His immense charity, his humble love for all who encountered him, poor and rich alike, wealthy merchants or nobles, murderers and pariahs, all were targets of his deep love and charity. He also had the ability to use great humor in all he did--all smiled and laughed around him! He lived in a hard time for the church and his unusual confraternity was investigated by the Curia more than once, only to disarm the pope completely when faced with his deep love for others and total trust in God's Providence.The film was made for Italian TV and the production is very good. We loved the actors and the costumes. An impressive details is w they managed to gather such similar -looking actors to portrays the child and grown up versions of his followers, it is almost as if they started the film when they were children and waited ten years to continue, so similar they were.Note: I read the other reviews and am very respectful of them and recommend their reading. Perhaps because we had such a wonderful time watching it as a family, and perhaps because we already know real facts are changed in films about saints, I still give it 4 stars. The film does show Christian love in many beautiful ways and we live in a world so thirsty for that. After the film we read a brief account of his life online and were further enriched.",4,Nice family film!,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,1833,"['received', 'Christmas', 'have', 'watched', 'installments', 'Tears', 'streamed', 'eyes', 'last', 'night', 'beautiful', 'final', 'scene', 'filled', 'screen', 'were', 'watching', 'husband', 'youngest', 'were', 'delighted', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'knew', 'much', 'Saint', 'Philip', 'Neri', 'beforehand', 'name', 'so', 'very', 'familiar', 'not', 'great', 'saint', 'great', 'accomplishments', 'great', 'written', 'treaties', 'did', 'not', 'travel', 'intellect', 'did', 'not', 'shine', 'was', 'great', 'immense', 'charity', 'humble', 'love', 'who', 'encountered', 'poor', 'rich', 'alike', 'wealthy', 'merchants', 'nobles', 'murderers', 'pariahs', 'were', 'targets', 'deep', 'love', 'charity', 'also', 'had', 'ability', 'use', 'great', 'humor', 'did', 'smiled', 'laughed', 'lived', 'hard', 'time', 'church', 'unusual', 'confraternity', 'was', 'investigated', 'Curia', 'more', 'once', 'only', 'disarm', 'pope', 'completely', 'when', 'faced', 'deep', 'love', 'others', 'total', 'trust', 'God', 'Providence.The', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Italian', 'TV', 'production', 'very', 'good', 'loved', 'actors', 'costumes', 'impressive', 'details', 'managed', 'gather', 'such', 'similar', '-looking', 'actors', 'portrays', 'child', 'grown', 'up', 'versions', 'followers', 'almost', 'started', 'film', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'waited', 'ten', 'years', 'continue', 'similar', 'were.Note', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'am', 'very', 'respectful', 'recommend', 'reading', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'such', 'wonderful', 'time', 'watching', 'family', 'perhaps', 'already', 'know', 'real', 'facts', 'are', 'changed', 'films', 'saints', 'still', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'film', 'show', 'Christian', 'love', 'many', 'beautiful', 'ways', 'live', 'world', 'so', 'thirsty', 'film', 'read', 'brief', 'account', 'life', 'online', 'were', 'further', 'enriched']",Saint Philip Neri: I Prefer Heaven

He never loses hope and always forgives those who hurt him. He is blessed with miracles but always remains humble. In time, he achieves his new dream to build a 'conservatorio' for the youth, wins over his enemies and trains his youth into adult leaders in the community.I was taken by the love of this saintly man.  he never stopped and was obedient to God who dictated to him what He wanted him to do.

1496761,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B005OT3FW2,K. Ostrowski,"[8, 11]","It's strange.  When I finished watching this movie for the first time, I remember really enjoying it, but having had some time to think it over, I realize that this movie really has nothing that Bakhita didn't have, and, in fact, is just a tad bit worse in some areas.This movie is made by the same director who did Bakhita and St. Giuseppe Moscatti, and I can't say I'm surprised.  Those films, like this one, were largely sensational pieces intended to amuse, but contained little or nothing that resembled the lives of the real people they were named after.  This film claims to be about Saint Philip Neri, and as usual, it has nothing to do with him.St. Philip Neri was a very holy man who, at first, wanted to go to India as a missionary, but eventually decided to stay in Rome, where he started a secular club of sorts for educated Catholics who wanted to learn about God.  It had fairly lenient regulations, and he himself was a joyful man who believed that everyone else should strive for joy as well; particularly in prayer and worship.Regrettably, he's not the star of this movie.What we have, instead, is a very holy man who, at first, wanted to go to India as a missionary, but no positions were open, so he had to stay in Rome.  There, he runs into a gang of kids and spends some time caring for them and trying to raise them right.  Hijinks and misadventures ensue with the children, before and after reaching adulthood, and most of the story centers around them.  What little has to do with the film's title character is either wrapped up in his relationships with the kids, or in charity work with the poor and destitute, as though he were Mother Theresa, or in warding off a militant cardinal of the church who manages to sick two popes on him.  He then needs to satisfy both of them somehow to keep everything running.Neri has something of a catchphrase throughout this movie ""be good, if you can.""  As far as I can tell, this disgusting catchphrase was never attributed to him, and shouldn't have been allowed to pass through the dark depths of the pen used by whoever wrote this movie.  It's one of the worst things about this film.Another of the worst things about the movie is, as I've said, the repeated use of the church hierarchy as the villains.  It'd be one thing if it actually happened that way, but I've never read anything that would indicate that.  I won't say that higher-ups within the church never abuse their power.  Living in a place like the US, where organized protests against rampant evil on the part of the nation's cardinals and bishops are so rare, I wouldn't even think of making a claim like that, but it's a lack of devotion to church teaching, not an overabundance of it, that's the problem here.Thirdly, the children dominate far too much of the movie.  This movie shouldn't be about them; particularly since Neri hardly ever worked with people under 30 in real life.  One of them (the girl Ippolita) also has a questionable neckline as an adult, which, in that time period, would have gotten her mistaken for a prostitute, and, in fact, does get her mistaken for one at least once in the film, if I remember correctly.Now for the film's strengths.  Like previous movies by this director, it's a strongly-written story with a heartwarming conclusion and endearing characters.  If the real Saint Philip Neri had never existed, I'd have given it an A-.The music of the movie centers largely around the main piece; ""I prefer Heaven,"" which, while simple, is easy to remember and catchy, and I'm been humming it off and on since I finished watching the film.  Most of the other pieces of music in the film are built around the same basic tune as the main theme, which is a bold move to make, but is used to great effect.  Some of the costumes were impressive, while others, in my mind, were less impressive.  It's not as strong as Bakhita in that respect.Still, I honestly found that it made more enjoyable viewing than Bakhita, for a number of reasons, really, mainly to do with the quality of the characters invented for the piece, and the hard work of the actors involved; depicting their roles so well.However, there's one last thing that I just can't get past with this movie.  It was less evident in Bakhita, and more in this production, but really, visible in both.  There's an unhealthy notion in the modern world that the role of those in the church is largely to help the sick and needy with their bodily needs, and then mostly get out of the way when big wrongs need to be righted, or when anything needs to be said about morality.  While Bakhita was shown caring for the sick, and rarely said a proactive word about morality, this movie goes out of its way to paint its main character as just as much of a hospice-runner as Mother Theresa, but without all those ""offensive"" viewpoints that condemn the popular views of the world as ""evil,"" ""reprehensible"" and ""sinful.""  I find that kind of bias on the part of a filmmaker to be the really offensive thing.The fact that I had a good time in spite of all that is a strong testimony in favor of this film.  However, whether you want to watch it or not is really up to you.  There was a movie based on the life of Saint John Bosco, which did basically everything this film did, except that it was about a person who really did do some of these things, and it didn't try to paint him as weak-willed or morally-silent.At the end of the day, I simply have to say that this is a very good movie, but not very good for Catholics.  Judging it just based on the strength of its characters and story, it was excellent.  Judging it on its faithfulness to the church produces a less-favorable result.  Let's just hope this director can get his act together for whatever he decides to do next.  I did have fun watching it, but I don't want to see any more good, decent people misrepresented or lied about.  That always puts a damper on my mood.",3,"Paradiso, Paradiso...

1496763,AIVWYHNOME34I,B005OT3FW2,M. De Sapio,"[79, 91]","I came to this film already familiar with the life and spirituality of St. Philip Neri, who was my confirmation saint and in whom I have a special interest and devotion.  I discovered the film through the Ignatius Press catalogue, which seemed to bode well for its quality.  I thought it would be interesting to see a dramatization of St. Philip's life, and to be able practice my Italian comprehension as well was a bonus.  Well, my expectations were crushed as soon as I started to watch the DVD.  Instead of a straightforward biography of the saint, the filmmakers have woven a fictional story around the general person and times of Philip Neri.  In this account, Filippo is a middle-aged priest who comes to Rome, where he ministers to homeless children (in point of fact, Philip was a young man when he came to Rome, and his apostolate was primarily with young men); the film follows the children into young adulthood through various fictionalized subplots and Philip's building of a church and hospital to minister to the poor.  But in addition, the screenwriters have woven into the story a conflict between Philip and a Roman cardinal (played very well by Roberto Citran), who is suspicious of Philip's ministry and attempts to destroy him.  Now, in point of fact, Philip was for a short time persecuted by a small clerical faction who suspected him of starting a sect; but as presented here, this is no more than an excuse to work in the old liberal cliche of the ""intolerant, authoritarian Church"" oppressing all that's good and pure.  Philip is eventually exonerated by the pope and allowed to continue his apostolate, but no attempt is made to deal with the issues invovled in anything but a superficial manner.  For the rest, the movie is fuzzy on the substance of Philip's spirituality (which focused on finding God in the beauty of nature and art, and on returning to the Christian roots, the Bible and the Church Fathers) and the specific activity of the religious order he founded, the Oratory (which started out as an informal gathering for prayer, sermons and sacred music, and evolved into a brotherhood of secular priests which later spread to several countries).  The popular Italian actor Gigi Proietti is delightful in the role of Philip, but he can't change the fact that the script has reduced the character to a simplistic hippie-dippy type devoid of any intellectual foundation.The film has some degree of entertainment value, though next to no religious or historical value.  Viewers, especially Catholics who are interested in this film for its religious content, should be forewarned of what they are getting.  At best, this is sentimental entertainment for children - though I would not show such an inaccurate film to any child of mine in order to teach him about one of my favorite saints.",2,Simple-Minded Historical Fiction,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,2823,"['came', 'film', 'already', 'familiar', 'life', 'spirituality', 'St.', 'Philip', 'Neri', 'who', 'was', 'confirmation', 'saint', 'whom', 'have', 'special', 'interest', 'devotion', 'discovered', 'film', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'catalogue', 'seemed', 'bode', 'well', 'quality', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'dramatization', 'St.', 'Philip', 'life', 'be', 'able', 'practice', 'Italian', 'comprehension', 'well', 'was', 'bonus', 'Well', 'expectations', 'were', 'crushed', 'as', 'soon', 'started', 'watch', 'DVD', 'Instead', 'straightforward', 'biography', 'saint', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'woven', 'fictional', 'story', 'general', 'person', 'times', 'Philip', 'Neri', 'account', 'Filippo', 'middle-aged', 'priest', 'who', 'Rome', 'where', 'homeless', 'children', 'point', 'fact', 'Philip', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'when', 'came', 'Rome', 'apostolate', 'was', 'primarily', 'young', 'men', 'film', 'children', 'young', 'adulthood', 'various', 'fictionalized', 'subplots', 'Philip', 'building', 'church', 'hospital', 'minister', 'poor', 'addition', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'woven', 'story', 'conflict', 'Philip', 'Roman', 'cardinal', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Roberto', 'Citran', 'who', 'suspicious', 'Philip', 'ministry', 'attempts', 'destroy', 'Now', 'point', 'fact', 'Philip', 'was', 'short', 'time', 'persecuted', 'small', 'clerical', 'faction', 'who', 'suspected', 'starting', 'sect', 'presented', 'here', 'more', 'excuse', 'work', 'old', 'liberal', 'cliche', 'intolerant', 'authoritarian', 'Church', 'oppressing', 'good', 'pure', 'Philip', 'eventually', 'exonerated', 'pope', 'allowed', 'continue', 'apostolate', 'attempt', 'made', 'deal', 'issues', 'invovled', 'anything', 'superficial', 'manner', 'rest', 'movie', 'fuzzy', 'substance', 'Philip', 'spirituality', 'focused', 'finding', 'God', 'beauty', 'nature', 'art', 'returning', 'Christian', 'roots', 'Bible', 'Church', 'Fathers', 'specific', 'activity', 'religious', 'order', 'founded', 'Oratory', 'started', 'out', 'informal', 'gathering', 'prayer', 'sermons', 'sacred', 'music', 'evolved', 'brotherhood', 'secular', 'priests', 'later', 'spread', 'several', 'countries', 'popular', 'Italian', 'actor', 'Gigi', 'Proietti', 'delightful', 'role', 'Philip', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'script', 'reduced', 'character', 'simplistic', 'hippie-dippy', 'type', 'devoid', 'intellectual', 'foundation.The', 'film', 'degree', 'entertainment', 'value', 'next', 'religious', 'historical', 'value', 'Viewers', 'especially', 'Catholics', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'film', 'religious', 'content', 'should', 'be', 'forewarned', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'best', 'sentimental', 'entertainment', 'children', 'would', 'not', 'show', 'such', 'inaccurate', 'film', 'child', 'mine', 'order', 'teach', 'one', 'favorite', 'saints']",Saint Philip Neri: I Prefer Heaven

1496765,A2UITTZE0YDER2,B005OT3FW2,"ServusDei ""udayajmj""","[52, 53]","Where can I start? What can I say? I just LOVE this film!!!! If I could give it 7 stars I would and that's no exaggeration. I have to admit it, I don't know much about Saint Philip Neri (SPN) other than that he was called the Apostle of Rome and that he is the founder of the Oratorians, one of the best orders in in the Catholic Church today, known for their great fidelity to the Church and their beautiful liturgies. I also know that TAN books has a great short biography on him. But enough of that already....about the film......RAI 1 (the Italian channel that produces these movies) usually tends to secularize their saints somewhat excluding usually the aspects of the miraculous that have surrounded the lives of many of them. So I was greatly surprised when this movie covered it all! A truly Catholic film! Mystical visits, miraculous appearance of food, healing,......all captivated in a very devotional manner. What is even more wonderful is the joy that the actor brings forth on the screen. The actor, Gigi Proietti, brings it out in a most admirable manner and portrays the saint's exceptional humor, even at times that would make the best of us scowl and get dejected. And yes, there's LOTS of humor. Nothing that portrays our Saint as a clown, but shows us that heaven too has its light moments.Also in the characters that surround SPN, many of us will be able to see ourselves in our best moments and our worst.Another aspect is how the Saint uses simple peasant wisdom to teach people who are erring. One poignant moment in the movie (and they are quite a few) is when a dejected follower of SPN asks why it is so hard to live the gospel message, and SPN answers ""Because it (the gospel message) is so simple!"".This movie is all about charity, joy, sorrow, hope, human failings, brokenness, forgiveness and complete surrender to Divine providence. In short it is the story of mankind and the love God has for it and how he sends us Saints at the times we need them. Perfect for anyone and everyone.And for educators who love films on Saints who worked with the youth.....it doesn't get better than this.This movie should not be missed out on.I do not know the historical accuracy of this movie. I will leave that to some other expert who will be able to verify it properly. However it is assumed that some artistic license would have been taken.The movie is 205 minutes long in Italian with English and Spanish subtitles. It comes with a 16 page booklet with the following sections:1)St. Philip Neri, the Man, the Saint by Carl E. Olson2)Blessed John Henry Newman's prayer to Saint Philip Neri3)Saint Philip Neri, priest and spiritual father by Rev. Fredericl L. Miller4)St.Philip's Legacy: Holiness and Friendship5)Discussion questions6)Scene SelectionsThe only special feature in this DVD is a short behind the scenes of the making of the film.By the by, get some Kleenex....you'll be needing them.....the humor and the tears of joy you'll shed will warrant them!For more on the life of SPN I recommend as mentioned above the following book:St. Philip Neri",5,Heaven prefered for you and me.,1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,3076,"['Where', 'can', 'start', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'just', 'LOVE', 'film', 'could', 'give', '7', 'stars', 'would', 'exaggeration', 'have', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Saint', 'Philip', 'Neri', 'SPN', 'other', 'was', 'called', 'Apostle', 'Rome', 'founder', 'Oratorians', 'one', 'best', 'orders', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'today', 'known', 'great', 'fidelity', 'Church', 'beautiful', 'liturgies', 'also', 'know', 'TAN', 'books', 'great', 'short', 'biography', 'enough', 'already', 'film', '1', 'Italian', 'channel', 'movies', 'usually', 'secularize', 'saints', 'somewhat', 'excluding', 'usually', 'aspects', 'miraculous', 'have', 'surrounded', 'lives', 'many', 'was', 'greatly', 'surprised', 'when', 'movie', 'covered', 'A', 'truly', 'Catholic', 'film', 'Mystical', 'visits', 'miraculous', 'appearance', 'food', 'healing', 'captivated', 'very', 'devotional', 'manner', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'wonderful', 'joy', 'actor', 'forth', 'screen', 'actor', 'Gigi', 'Proietti', 'out', 'most', 'admirable', 'manner', 'saint', 'exceptional', 'humor', 'even', 'times', 'would', 'make', 'best', 'scowl', 'get', 'dejected', 'yes', 'LOTS', 'humor', 'Nothing', 'Saint', 'clown', 'heaven', 'too', 'light', 'moments.Also', 'characters', 'surround', 'SPN', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'best', 'moments', 'worst.Another', 'aspect', 'how', 'Saint', 'simple', 'peasant', 'wisdom', 'teach', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'erring', 'One', 'poignant', 'moment', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'when', 'dejected', 'follower', 'SPN', 'why', 'so', 'hard', 'live', 'gospel', 'message', 'SPN', 'answers', 'gospel', 'message', 'so', 'simple', '.This', 'movie', 'charity', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'hope', 'human', 'failings', 'brokenness', 'forgiveness', 'complete', 'surrender', 'Divine', 'providence', 'short', 'story', 'mankind', 'love', 'God', 'how', 'Saints', 'times', 'need', 'Perfect', 'anyone', 'everyone.And', 'educators', 'who', 'love', 'films', 'Saints', 'who', 'worked', 'youth', '..it', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'this.This', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'out', 'on.I', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'other', 'expert', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'verify', 'properly', 'However', 'assumed', 'artistic', 'license', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'taken.The', 'movie', '205', 'minutes', 'long', 'Italian', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', '16', 'page', 'booklet', 'following', 'sections:1', 'St.', 'Philip', 'Neri', 'Man', 'Saint', 'Carl', 'E.', 'Olson2', 'Blessed', 'John', 'Henry', 'Newman', 'prayer', 'Saint', 'Philip', 'Neri3', 'Saint', 'Philip', 'Neri', 'priest', 'spiritual', 'father', 'Rev', 'Fredericl', 'L.', 'Miller4', 'St.Philip', 'Legacy', 'Holiness', 'Friendship5', 'Discussion', 'questions6', 'Scene', 'SelectionsThe', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'short', 'scenes', 'making', 'film.By', 'get', 'Kleenex', ""'ll"", 'be', 'needing', '..the', 'humor', 'tears', 'joy', ""'ll"", 'shed', 'will', 'warrant', 'more', 'life', 'SPN', 'recommend', 'as', 'mentioned', 'following', 'book', 'St.', 'Philip', 'Neri']",Saint Philip Neri: I Prefer Heaven
