First, our heroines decide to hide around the corner after running through what seemed like several blocks. Never mind the taxis. Then it's go to Chinatown, and take the subway. What? One of the pursuers appears on the train from nowhere? Better jump out. Now we're in Chinatown. But the pursuers get a tip that the ladies are there. Good thing Chinatown is a single block on Canal St, and that it takes zero time for the bad guys to show up at either end of the block. Hey, let's hop in a store! Why didn't we think of that until now? Who cares? But since Chinatown is a single block, the bad guys at either end spot the shop they go in.But they use cunning disguises and suddenly appear in Grand Central Station. Gee, why didn't they hop in a cab and go to Grand Central right away? Couldn't have a chase then. Now they're concerned about airports. So they logically get on Metro North, which doesn't go to an airport. PATH to NJ would get them to NWK. Subway and bus would get them to LGA or JFK. And a taxi would take them to any airport they wanted. Which is what they should have done 20 minutes earlier.Screw it, let's end with a pointless drawn out sequence of the ladies sitting in the Metro North train while it chugs up the Hudson River. Forget about a subway to the Bronx and a turn-around to Queens where the airports are. Forget about hopping off for a taxi. That probably wouldn't work, though, because the bad guys can teleport to wherever they may be as long as they stay in Manhattan.Seriously one of the most contrived and idiotic sequences I've seen in a long time. All logic, all time, all space, all is warped to fit the screenplay, the terrible screenplay.",1,It has never been so easy to chase people thru Manhattan as here,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,2082,"['movie', 'was', 'awful', 'mostly', 'stuck', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'awful', 'could', 'be.We', 'have', 'disjointed', 'sequences', 'cutting', 'one', 'location', 'character', 'still', 'talking', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'thoughts', 'conversations', 'events', 'past', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'people', 'appearing', 'need', 'be', 'apparent', 'motion.At', 'end', 'get', 'chase', 'thru', 'Manhattan', 'First', 'heroines', 'decide', 'hide', 'corner', 'running', 'what', 'seemed', 'like', 'several', 'blocks', 'Never', 'mind', 'taxis', 'Then', 'go', 'Chinatown', 'take', 'subway', 'What', 'One', 'pursuers', 'train', 'nowhere', 'Better', 'jump', 'out', 'Now', ""'re"", 'Chinatown', 'pursuers', 'get', 'tip', 'ladies', 'are', 'there', 'Good', 'thing', 'Chinatown', 'single', 'block', 'Canal', 'St', 'zero', 'time', 'bad', 'guys', 'show', 'up', 'end', 'block', 'Hey', 'let', 'hop', 'store', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'now', 'Who', 'Chinatown', 'single', 'block', 'bad', 'guys', 'end', 'spot', 'shop', 'go', 'in.But', 'use', 'cunning', 'disguises', 'suddenly', 'appear', 'Grand', 'Central', 'Station', 'Gee', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'hop', 'cab', 'go', 'Grand', 'Central', 'right', 'away', 'Could', ""n't"", 'have', 'chase', 'then', 'Now', ""'re"", 'concerned', 'airports', 'logically', 'get', 'Metro', 'North', ""n't"", 'go', 'airport', 'PATH', 'NJ', 'would', 'get', 'NWK', 'Subway', 'bus', 'would', 'get', 'LGA', 'JFK', 'taxi', 'would', 'take', 'airport', 'wanted', 'Which', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'done', '20', 'minutes', 'earlier.Screw', 'let', 'end', 'pointless', 'drawn', 'out', 'sequence', 'ladies', 'sitting', 'Metro', 'North', 'train', 'up', 'Hudson', 'River', 'Forget', 'subway', 'Bronx', 'turn-around', 'Queens', 'where', 'airports', 'are', 'Forget', 'hopping', 'off', 'taxi', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'though', 'bad', 'guys', 'can', 'teleport', 'wherever', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'long', 'stay', 'Manhattan.Seriously', 'one', 'most', 'contrived', 'idiotic', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'logic', 'time', 'space', 'warped', 'fit', 'screenplay', 'terrible', 'screenplay']",N/A

It's a movie that uses the city well and lets the audience follow along to try solving the mystery. Husband & wife team Morgan and Overton shared writing and directing duties and, to my way of thinking, did a respectable job. It's a straight-forward suspense tale that doesn't get bogged down by gimmicks or by pretending to be something it's not.",5,The Collective stands apart from the crowd.,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,511,"['Star', 'Kelly', 'Overton', 'solid', 'performance', 'woman', 'searching', 'city', 'sister', 'who', 'fallen', 'charismatic', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'group', 'movie', 'city', 'well', 'audience', 'follow', 'try', 'solving', 'mystery', 'Husband', 'wife', 'team', 'Morgan', 'Overton', 'shared', 'writing', 'directing', 'duties', 'way', 'thinking', 'did', 'respectable', 'job', 'straight-forward', 'suspense', 'tale', ""n't"", 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'gimmicks', 'pretending', 'be', 'something', 'not']",N/A
1344999,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B003G7167U,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[5, 5]","Kelly Overton is the attractive woman who both starred and co-directed and wrote the script to this mystery of a girl racing to New York City to rescue her sister from mysterious forces.The photography is beautiful, the locations are striking of Manhattan--a place I called home for thirty years so it was interesting to recognize where the action was filmed.Alas, though, the story has too many plot holes to succeed as a gripping study in terror.The church where this mysterious sect has taken over is actually the picturesque Limelight, a church turned into a disco watering hole during the l980s. It's located at 20th Street and Sixth Avenue--one of the most congested areas in Manhattan. Tens of thousands of pedestrians, cops, cabs, throng this area hourly. If you screamed, you'd be mobbed within a nano second. Neither of the two girls make any attempt to find help.When the two sisters escape the villians in the church, they race to find safety and in one rather hysterical moment, they decide to stoop down around the corner of a building .Then they race to Chinatown. At no time did either one just use their cell phone to call 911. There are tens of thousands of cops in NYC. They're especially visible in the areas where our escapees run.We never know exactly what this strange sect is doing. Why do they use this church for their headquarters? Why are they so obsessed with keeping the sister in captivity? There is nothing chilling or mysterious or exciting about this movie.This movie is an exact remake of Val Lewton's classic l943 chiller, THE SEVENTH VICTIM--in which a girl comes to NYC to find her sister who has joined a strange cult.Hate to say it but Val Lewton's little gem of weirdness will be around for a long time.""The Collective"" will struggle to find an audience.",2,Call 911,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,1795,"['Kelly', 'Overton', 'attractive', 'woman', 'who', 'starred', 'co-directed', 'wrote', 'script', 'mystery', 'girl', 'racing', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'rescue', 'sister', 'mysterious', 'forces.The', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'are', 'striking', 'Manhattan', 'place', 'called', 'home', 'thirty', 'years', 'was', 'interesting', 'recognize', 'where', 'action', 'was', 'filmed.Alas', 'though', 'story', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'succeed', 'gripping', 'study', 'terror.The', 'church', 'where', 'mysterious', 'sect', 'taken', 'over', 'actually', 'picturesque', 'Limelight', 'church', 'turned', 'disco', 'watering', 'hole', 'l980s', 'located', '20th', 'Street', 'Sixth', 'Avenue', 'one', 'most', 'congested', 'areas', 'Manhattan', 'Tens', 'thousands', 'pedestrians', 'cops', 'cabs', 'throng', 'area', 'hourly', 'screamed', ""'d"", 'be', 'mobbed', 'nano', 'second', 'two', 'girls', 'make', 'attempt', 'find', 'two', 'sisters', 'escape', 'villians', 'church', 'race', 'find', 'safety', 'one', 'rather', 'hysterical', 'moment', 'decide', 'stoop', 'down', 'corner', 'building', '.Then', 'race', 'Chinatown', 'time', 'did', 'one', 'just', 'use', 'cell', 'phone', 'call', '911', 'are', 'tens', 'thousands', 'cops', 'NYC', ""'re"", 'especially', 'visible', 'areas', 'where', 'escapees', 'run.We', 'never', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'strange', 'sect', 'doing', 'Why', 'do', 'use', 'church', 'headquarters', 'Why', 'are', 'so', 'obsessed', 'keeping', 'sister', 'captivity', 'nothing', 'chilling', 'mysterious', 'exciting', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'exact', 'remake', 'Val', 'Lewton', 'classic', 'l943', 'chiller', 'THE', 'SEVENTH', 'VICTIM', 'girl', 'NYC', 'find', 'sister', 'who', 'joined', 'strange', 'cult.Hate', 'say', 'Val', 'Lewton', 'little', 'gem', 'weirdness', 'will', 'be', 'around', 'long', 'time', 'Collective', 'will', 'struggle', 'find', 'audience']",N/A
