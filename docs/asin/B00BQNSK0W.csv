1637625,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00BQNSK0W,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","Alan is a man about to have it all after growing up in an economically lower class family. His mother worked as a cleaner in a garage and Alan is now within days of marrying the daughter of the owner of the garage and car dealership. The owner often engages in off the books transactions of vehicles and is in the process of giving Alan significant responsibility in the running of the business.In anticipation of the wedding, Alan and two of his friends that work at the garage go out partying, but when Alan is driving back he hits a man. Urged by his friends to take off before anyone sees them, Alan gets back in the car and leaves the scene without even bothering to call for assistance. His friends tell him that he will lose all that he is about to receive if he reports the incident.Unknown to Alan, Juliette a woman with an upstairs apartment overlooking the road, sees enough in the dark to recognize him if she sees him again. Alan is unable to forget the accident and the remorse and guilt begins to overwhelm him. The stricken man is a married, undocumented worker from Moldavia and his wife has no financial means with which she can cope.Juliette recognizes Alan and she tracks him down and demands that he does something to aid Vera, the wife of the stricken man that is now a widow. This creates a very complicated situation for Alan is only about to become a man of means, right now his funds are limited. The Moldavian friends of Vera also seek out Alan and while Juliette befriends Vera, she also has empathy for Alan as she realizes that he is not an evil man and is being destroyed by the guilt.As the movie progresses things continue to get complicated as more people learn more and now Juliette begins to realize the consequences of getting involved and trying to do the right thing. Alan learns that his initial mistake and what he did after will forever change his life.Emotionally charged with strong moral dilemmas, this is a film containing a very tangled web all weaved from a single tragic incident and the wrong decision made in the fear of the moment. The performances are excellent, you feel for all the people as they try to cope with the aftermath of a tragedy.",5,A tangled web emanating from a tragic accident,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,2196,"['Alan', 'man', 'have', 'growing', 'up', 'economically', 'lower', 'class', 'family', 'mother', 'worked', 'cleaner', 'garage', 'Alan', 'now', 'days', 'marrying', 'daughter', 'owner', 'garage', 'car', 'dealership', 'owner', 'often', 'off', 'books', 'transactions', 'vehicles', 'process', 'giving', 'Alan', 'significant', 'responsibility', 'running', 'business.In', 'anticipation', 'wedding', 'Alan', 'two', 'friends', 'work', 'garage', 'go', 'out', 'partying', 'when', 'Alan', 'driving', 'back', 'man', 'Urged', 'friends', 'take', 'off', 'anyone', 'Alan', 'back', 'car', 'scene', 'even', 'bothering', 'call', 'assistance', 'friends', 'tell', 'will', 'lose', 'receive', 'incident.Unknown', 'Alan', 'Juliette', 'woman', 'upstairs', 'apartment', 'overlooking', 'road', 'enough', 'dark', 'recognize', 'again', 'Alan', 'unable', 'forget', 'accident', 'remorse', 'guilt', 'begins', 'overwhelm', 'stricken', 'man', 'married', 'undocumented', 'worker', 'Moldavia', 'wife', 'financial', 'means', 'can', 'cope.Juliette', 'recognizes', 'Alan', 'down', 'demands', 'something', 'aid', 'Vera', 'wife', 'stricken', 'man', 'now', 'widow', 'very', 'complicated', 'situation', 'Alan', 'only', 'about', 'become', 'man', 'means', 'right', 'now', 'funds', 'are', 'limited', 'Moldavian', 'friends', 'Vera', 'also', 'seek', 'out', 'Alan', 'Juliette', 'Vera', 'also', 'empathy', 'Alan', 'not', 'evil', 'man', 'being', 'destroyed', 'guilt.As', 'movie', 'things', 'continue', 'get', 'complicated', 'more', 'people', 'learn', 'more', 'now', 'Juliette', 'realize', 'consequences', 'getting', 'involved', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Alan', 'initial', 'mistake', 'what', 'did', 'will', 'forever', 'change', 'life.Emotionally', 'charged', 'strong', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'film', 'containing', 'very', 'tangled', 'web', 'weaved', 'single', 'tragic', 'incident', 'wrong', 'decision', 'made', 'fear', 'moment', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'feel', 'people', 'try', 'cope', 'aftermath', 'tragedy']",N/A
1637626,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00BQNSK0W,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Three Worlds is an intense character study.The film centers around three characters, an illegal immigrant, a suburban bourgeois, and a city intellectual. Their worlds converge around a single horrible event. The French have a tradition of creating films where a tragic moment drives everything else in the film.Three Worlds is a deliberate film that develops gradually to an ending that I could not predict. Slowly I was drawn into the lives of these three people. I cared about what happened to all three of them. I wanted to know more and wondered what would happen next. This is the genius of the film, I cared so much. I was speechless at the end.I refuse to tell anything more about this film, it is critical to not know how it will end or when that tragic event will happen. Those surprises are important to the enjoyment of this film. At an hour and forty minutes it is slightly long, although the director did pace this film rather well (it felt like it was a little long, but I don't know how I would tighten it up without losing something).The film is presented in French and an Eastern European language with English subtitles. The film is not rated. There is some strong language in the subtitles. There is a bit of graphic violence. And there is one scene of a couple having sex in a car, it isn't explicit, but clear what the couple is doing. This would probably be rated R by the MPAA. A mature younger viewer could watch this film.This film isn't really a conversation about immigration or class. It is about how people react to a tragic event, and how that event draws them in close to each other and separates them. It is about human decency, love, and heartbreak. All the other obvious things are simply window dressing to present this deeper conversation about these three people.The film is beautifully acted. The camera work was well done; the director avoided too many handheld cameras.The DVD included a wonderful thirteen minute short. It is one of the stranger films Film Movement has included on a disc. The brief description of the film gives too much away; I would have rather been surprised by the first dramatic moment. My wife didn't read the summary on the DVD menu and enjoyed the film much more than I did. The short fits beautifully with the main film. It is well worth watching after the main feature.This is a difficult to describe and put in a box film. Three Worlds is well worth watching. I enjoyed this film very much. Film Movement has found another independent film that wouldn't normally see much distribution.I received a review copy.",5,Compelling Character Study,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,2580,"['Three', 'Worlds', 'intense', 'character', 'study.The', 'film', 'centers', 'three', 'characters', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'suburban', 'bourgeois', 'city', 'intellectual', 'worlds', 'converge', 'single', 'horrible', 'event', 'French', 'have', 'tradition', 'creating', 'films', 'where', 'tragic', 'moment', 'drives', 'everything', 'else', 'film.Three', 'Worlds', 'deliberate', 'film', 'gradually', 'ending', 'could', 'not', 'predict', 'Slowly', 'was', 'drawn', 'lives', 'three', 'people', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'three', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'wondered', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'genius', 'film', 'cared', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'speechless', 'end.I', 'refuse', 'tell', 'anything', 'more', 'film', 'critical', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'when', 'tragic', 'event', 'will', 'happen', 'surprises', 'are', 'important', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'slightly', 'long', 'director', 'did', 'pace', 'film', 'rather', 'well', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'would', 'tighten', 'up', 'losing', 'something', '.The', 'film', 'presented', 'French', 'Eastern', 'European', 'language', 'English', 'subtitles', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'strong', 'language', 'subtitles', 'bit', 'graphic', 'violence', 'one', 'scene', 'couple', 'having', 'sex', 'car', ""n't"", 'explicit', 'clear', 'what', 'couple', 'doing', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'rated', 'R', 'MPAA', 'mature', 'younger', 'viewer', 'could', 'watch', 'film.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'conversation', 'immigration', 'class', 'how', 'people', 'react', 'tragic', 'event', 'how', 'event', 'close', 'other', 'human', 'decency', 'love', 'heartbreak', 'other', 'obvious', 'things', 'are', 'simply', 'window', 'dressing', 'present', 'deeper', 'conversation', 'three', 'people.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'director', 'avoided', 'too', 'many', 'handheld', 'cameras.The', 'DVD', 'included', 'wonderful', 'thirteen', 'minute', 'short', 'one', 'stranger', 'films', 'Film', 'Movement', 'included', 'disc', 'brief', 'description', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'been', 'surprised', 'first', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'summary', 'DVD', 'menu', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'did', 'short', 'fits', 'beautifully', 'main', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'main', 'feature.This', 'difficult', 'describe', 'put', 'box', 'film', 'Three', 'Worlds', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'Film', 'Movement', 'found', 'independent', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'see', 'much', 'distribution.I', 'received', 'review', 'copy']",N/A
1637627,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00BQNSK0W,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","The stuff of great drama is conflict - how people intersect and interact with one another - and this is chiefly begun by throwing characters together.  They collide with one another in ways that spark emotions or develop intrigue, at least so much so that the audience watching is interesting in knowing more, in being unable to turn away for fear of missing something crucial.  Yes, while there are only a handful of stories that can be told (I've heard it told that there are seven fundamental premises behind all of narrative fiction), it's the way these disparate players come together that matters.  They each have their own emotional baggage, and how they sort through their differences - based on their upbringing, their personal beliefs, or their own moral convictions - is what fuels any motion picture.THREE WORLDS is a tremendously involving tale that posits three primary characters - along with a good handful of terrific supporting players, too - that quickly gets to the heart of such great drama; fittingly, it all begins with a collision.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Al (played with terrific attachment by Raphael Personnaz) finally has it all: he's gone from rags-to-riches, starting out with nothing and rising to the top of an elite automobile dealership through proven sales successes.  He's recently been promoted to manager, and he's about to wed his boss's daughter, a beautiful young professional who appears to be the perfect catch.  But one night while partying with two of his work colleagues, Al commits a hit-and-run accident, seriously injuring a man crossing the street.  At the behest of his two mates, Al flees the scene of the crime, unbeknownst to the fact that it was all witnessed by a young woman living in an apartment above the square.Enter Juliette (Clotilde Hesme): distraught from arguing with her boyfriend, she walks to her apartment's balcony and looks down into the street exactly at the moment of the collision.  She watches in horror at Al climbs from his car and then ultimately races away.  Racing downstairs, she sits with the fallen man until the ambulance arrives, all the while wanting to help him, to ease his pain, and to make it all go away.Enter Vera (Arta Dobroshi): she is the wife of the man struck down in the street.  Once she is brought to the hospital, she adopts Juliette as a friend in order to have someone to experience these treacherous moments with.  Over the course of the next few days, they grow closer as they sit at her husband's side, waiting to see whether he'll live or die from the consequences of the accident.From here, THREE WORLDS begins.  The picture, written and directed by Catherine Corsini, is a tightly paced drama that deals with the human condition - how and why we do what we do, as well as how and why we suffer as a result from the choices we make.  It's a brilliant character study - Al's assuredness slowly fades away as he seeks to make amends with his terrible mistake; Juliette's frustration with her own boyfriend comes to a head when she meets Al and realizes he's not a terrible person; and Vera fights against the social system that ostracizes outsiders (she's in France illegally) all the while trying to come to grips with grief.  These three people from different lives and different backgrounds can't help but intersect again and again and again, despite their best efforts, and it'll slowly lead to their everyday existence unraveling in ways none of them ever imagined.In the end, THREE WORLDS is all about how we, as people, seek some kind of resolution - spiritual, personal, financial, etc. - and it cleverly reminds us that forgiveness is easy but acceptance never comes without a price on one's soul.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that THREE WORLDS won the Audience Award for Honorable Mention (Best New French Film) at the 2012 Philadelphia Film Festival.  Additionally, it's been played as an Official Selection to the Cannes and the Toronto International Film Festival.  Bravo to all involved.THREE WORLDS (2012) is produced by Pyramide Productions, France 3 Cinema, Canal+, and a whole host of others (surf on over to IMDB.com if you're all that interested).  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by Film Movement.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a French spoken language release with French subtitles (there is no English dubbing available).  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds terrific consistently.  As for the special features, there isn't much: there's a bonus short film from director Olivier Treiner (THE PIANO TUNER) for those interested.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Outside of the final scene - where it would appear all of the events of THREE WORLDS merely add up to exposition with no message - the film is a masterful production in many ways reminiscent of the best works of Alfred Hitchcock: people find themselves in the darndest places, and they do what they must to try to reconcile the good, the bad, and the ugly of what they've done.  The performances are terrific all around, and that's probably owed in no small measure to writer/director Catherine Corsini's command of the world she's created.  It's a nightmare of collision in more ways than one, and I certainly hope it finds a wider audience.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Film Movement provided me with a DVD copy of THREE WORLDS by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",5,THREE WORLDS Collide In Desperate Ways,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,5845,"['stuff', 'great',

1637628,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00BQNSK0W,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","THREE WORLDS is a stunningly dramatic film directed by Catherine Corsini who co-wrote the story and screenplay with Benot Graffin in collaboration with Antoine Jaccoud and Lise Macheboeuf - a film that approaches several poignant subjects that all weave together to make this a study in human responsibility from birth to death. The acting is extraordinary, the pacing exactly on mark, the cinematography by Claire Mathon enhances the themes, the subtle musical score by Gr&eacute;goire Hetzel underlines the tension, and the lessons it presents and drives home make is one of the more important social statements before the public today. And additional credit should be given to Film Movement for bringing it to our attention.Al (the very fine Raphal Personnaz) is an attractive young man who has risen from the lower stratum of French society to become the co-owner of an automobile firm owned by the shifty but wealthy Testard (Jean-Pierre Malo) and is due to be married to the Testard's daughter Marion (Ad&egrave;le Haenel) in 10 days. Out celebrating one evening with his friends and fellow workers Franck (Reda Kateb) and Martin (Alban Aumard) Al is the perpetrator of a hit and run accident, critically injuring a Moldavian pedestrian, a scene that is witnessed by the pregnant Juliette (Clotilde Hesme), a woman struggling with her own problems of relationship with the baby's philosophy professor father Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric (Laurent Capelluto) who calls 911 to the scene.  Al is terrified of his actions, but is convinced by his friends to ignore the situation: after all, the victim is merely an illegal immigrant. Juliette is wrought with empathy, discovers the victim's name, meets the victim's wife Vera (Arta Dobroshi) and the two women bond. Al is so disturbed by his action that he visits the hospital where the victim is in ICU and is seen by Juliette who then sets about to find Al to ask him to do the right thing - turn himself in to the police or at least give money to Vera who is without funds to pay for her husband's care. The plot becomes more complex as Al and Juliette are drawn together  - Juliette is the only person with whom he can share and admit his guilt. Juliette is then placed in a position of intermediary between the critically wounded husband of Vera, Vera's Moldavian `family' and Al. How the situation resolves - including the consequences of Al's moves with his boss and his finance and his encounters with Vera and her `family' and the death of Vera's husband forms the closure of this powerful film.There is a scene in a classroom where Juliette's husband is teaching philosophy that quotes Martin Heidegger, a German philosopher known for his existential and phenomenological explorations of the ""question of Being"" who Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric quotes as saying `the only thing we truly own is our death'.  It is a poignant moment that allows the rest of the film's themes to gel. This is a superb film worthy of wide attention.

1637629,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B00BQNSK0W,John D. Cofield,"[0, 0]","This French film with English subtitles is aptly named, because a moment of inattention brought three worlds crashing together.  Al is an up and coming young man from a poor family who has not only achieved professional success at the car dealership where he works, he has also had the good fortune to fall in love with and get engaged to his employer's daughter.  Life is going very well indeed for him until one evening, while out celebrating with a couple of friends and fellow employees, he runs down and badly injures a pedestrian.  His friends yell at him to drive on, that no one has seen what happened and that all will be well.  But someone has seen.  Juliette, a young medical student, has witnessed the accident though she is unable to identify the car or the driver.  She summons help and later visits the badly injured man in the hospital, where she meets his wife Vera, an illegal immigrant from Moldova.  Al, Juliette, and Vera become entangled in a complicated relationship dance where each has some power or hold over the others.Although this movie is about a man who committed a serious crime, it is not a simple morality piece.  The three main characters are all complex individuals, with no one being clearly ""the good guy"" or ""the heavy."" In the end a resolution is reached, though it is not satisfactory to any of the three, and we recognize that the accident and what came after it have created after effects that will reverberate through all three worlds for the rest of the characters' lives.The film is beautifully shot, with many dark brooding city scapes of Paris which fit the overall mood.  Three Worlds is not a film with easy answers.

1637631,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BQNSK0W,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 3]","The French drama ""Three Worlds"" has all the makings of a searing and unforgettable morality play. I was utterly fascinated by the situation it set up, the crisis in which it thrust its characters, and the weighty decisions each had to wrestle with. Despite my genuine enthusiasm about the concept, though, I feel like a lot of potential material was left unexplored. Though I liked the actors and thought the performances accomplished, the film maintains a chilly demeanor throughout which kept me emotionally distant. As much as I wanted to connect wholeheartedly with the moral quandaries that face the central characters, the movie's screenplay never invites a particular closeness. And in the end, several significant plot threads are left dangling in the wind. While this may sound like I actively dislike Catherine Corsini's film, nothing could be further from the truth. I liked it a great deal. I just think that it had the potential to be a devastating contemplation of guilt and responsibility in the modern era. Laid naked and bare, the film should have resonated deeper. As is, the resultant film instead plays out like an upscale soap opera as opposed to something much more significant and impactful.The movie basically looks at one tragic accident from the perspective of the three people that are irrevocably linked to it. After a night of hard drinking, a young man has a hit-and-run encounter with an illegal immigrant. Unbeknownst to him, he was witnessed by a nearby resident. The rest of the story will bring the culprit, the victim's wife, and the principle witness into and out of each other's lives. The young man (Raphal Personnaz) seemingly had everything with a impending wedding and a great new promotion. Wanting to do the right thing, but not wanting to dismantle his life, he is wracked with how to be of assistance but still hold on to everything that is important to him. The victim's wife (Arta Dobroshi) is a Moldavian immigrant with little to her name, but she has ties to an unsavory element looking for retribution. And the witness (Clotilde Hesme) is a pregnant woman who instantly connects with Dobroshi but finds herself drawn to Personnaz as well. Much of the movie details where responsibility lies. What is the best course for all involved? Personnaz is trying to assuage his guilt, Dobroshi is looking at practical survival, and Hesme is trying to navigate the middle ground.The film poses a number of interesting questions, especially relating to the immigrant situation and the value of life. Dobroshi (so good in Lorna's Silence) has a no-nonsense quality that is riveting. Personnaz, in my estimation, should be a star. Pushed to extremes, he is the character that (oddly enough) you see most fully. And Hesme is an appealing presence. I don't know that I fully bought some of the bonding between her and Personnaz, but I enjoyed their evolving relationship. In the end, I found ""Three Worlds"" interesting enough and well made. I just didn't love it the way I had hoped. I wanted to feel the pain in a way that I never did. As part of the DVD package, the Bonus Short Film is a 14 minute feature from France called ""The Piano Tuner."" This original piece by Olivier Treiner introduces a piano tuner who poses as blind to achieve more work. A brilliant idea, however, is dismantled when he stumbles into a situation that he wishes he really couldn't see. A macabre sense of humor makes this one a winner! Overall, ""Three Worlds"" is easily worth a look. Corsini has made a fine looking film distinguished by three great performances.

1637632,A2EMIIHBL60K7L,B00BQNSK0W,Luanne Ollivier,"[0, 0]","The fourth entry in the Film on Friday series is from Catherine Corsini, a French director . Three Worlds was an 2012 official selection for both the Cannes and Toronto International Film Festival, as well as others.A night carousing with two friends in the days leading up to his wedding irrevocably changes Al's life and that of two other women. While speeding through the streets with his attention on his cellphone, Al doesn't see the pedestrian - until he hits him. Stunned, he gets out of the car to see what has happened, but at the urging of his two friends they leave the scene. Unbeknownst to him, Juliette, who lives in apartment above, has witnessed the accident. Shaken, she cannot identify the car or the man to the police. She is unable to let it go and tracks down the victim's wife, Vera. Vera and her husband are illegal immigrants from Moldavia. Al, feeling guilty, sneaks into the hospital and is spotted by Juliette. She realizes he's the one...Corsini gives us three distinct views of the outcome of Al's actions. Al has everything to lose, does not want to admit culpability, yet his guilt starts to eat away at him, eroding the carefully built life he has made. Raphael Personnaz plays his role well.  I didn't like Al at all - Personnaz's portrayal of the character's initial swaggering and the crumbling and unravelling that followed were believable.Vera and her family present the harsh reality of illegal immigrants. The hospital is after someone to pay the bills. Vera must go to work the day her husband is operated on. The scene in the hospital with the doctors is especially powerful. Vera is played by Arta Dobroshi. She captured the mercurial tone of Vera that vacillated between sadness and anger, hurt and strength, friendship and loathing. She is the character I empathized with the most.And caught between the two in a predicament of her own making is Juliet, played by Clotilde Hesme who has made herself a friend to Vera and a confidante and more to Al. She puzzled me the most - her actions towards both are well meant, but with Al she strays into dangerous territory.The supporting cast is somewhat predictable, with the heavy handed boss, the obnoxious friends, and the grasping, clinging girlfriend, but they all do an admirable job.As viewers we can see the immediate effects of that single action. We can see things getting steadily worse as the principles compound and complicate the situation with yet another misstep. Where does our sympathy and empathy lie? Each of the three suffers a loss - physically and emotionally. Three Worlds is an excellent exploration of a moral dilemma. The camera action was good, the settings realistic and the sound track suited. Definitely recommended watching.The bonus short film included - The Piano Tuner - was also excellent. A young man pretends to be blind. While on a job, he sees something he shouldn't have...Three Worlds from Film Movement - 100 minutes.

1637633,AWPODHOB4GFWL,B00BQNSK0W,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[0, 0]","Director Catherine Corsini has crafted a poignant, deliberate and angst ridden film openly displaying the wide range of human emotions between three people. Each one different, with their worlds intertwined in guilt, remorse, empathy and possible resolution. A middle-class man (Al) is out with his long time buddies drinking one night when they accidentally strike a pedestrian. Fleeing, they are witnessed from the balcony of a pregnant woman (Juliette), who calls the police. Al is only a few days from marriage and a new life at a high-class car dealership. He has everything to lose.Juliette is having her own emotional upheavals and feels compelled to become part of the discovery of the driver. Adding to her dilemma, Juliette contacts and befriends the distraught victim's wife, Vera. Both Vera and her husband are illegal immigrants from Moldavia, adding to their problems of exposure and lack of finances for health care. Juliette also recognizes the guilt ridden driver when he secretly visits the stricken immigrant who is in severe intensive care.The well-paced plot continues with Juliette and Al slowly getting to know each other, discussing the incident, the future and the intense guilt and secrecy that they both feel. Juliette also rides a fine line when she finds herself in the middle between Al and Vera, acting as a mediator. The emotions run raw between all characters. The dialogue is sparse and succinct, sometimes edging to a point where it is impossible to predict how each character will react.Director Corsini and co writer Benot Graffin allow honest and complicated emotions and circumstances to unfold in a sometimes surprising way. Nothing is predictable. All three characters lives are at stake and the end result might not be exactly what you expect. It's a conundrum of simple decisions made and complicated conflicts that may never be resolved. Well worth a second or third watch, the cinematography and musical score are mesmerizing.Added to this DVD is a unique and Hitchcockian short called, &#34;The Piano Tuner&#34;. Olivier Treiner's ingenious short thriller tells the story of a young man who is a disgraced musical prodigy. He settles into becoming a piano tuner-- who also pretends to be blind. Fascinated by a blind piano tuner, people are very eager to hire the young man, making him in high demand. This places him in various awkward and funny circumstances when people go about their personal business while he tunes and plays their piano in their presence. The final scene finds the tuner entering a senior woman's apartment where she reluctantly allows him in. He sees something that shocks him, but he cannot let on. The final moments are spine chilling and makes for an ending that would make Hitchcock proud. It's that good.

1637634,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BQNSK0W,Paul Allaer,"[1, 2]","Let me state upfront that I am a big fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie films, so much so that I finally gave in last year and became a member of their ""DVD of the Month"" club. This is the May, 2013 release in that on-going series.""Three Worlds"" (2012 release from France; 100 min.) brings the story of three people who as a result of one horrible event get interconnected in the most unlikely of ways. In the first world, there is Al (played by Raphal Personnaz), a thirty-something up-and-comer at a luxury car dealership and who is about to marry the daughter of the dealership owner. One night Al is out late with co-workers and while driving home, he is careless (using his mobile) and hits a man at full speed. The man is badly hurt but after stepping out, Al is terrified and flees the scene. Second there is Juliette (played by Clotilde Hesme), a twenty-something young lady who is pregnant with the child of her guy-friend with whom she is not getting along well anymore. By chance, Juliette is staring out her window as the accident happens and she witnesses the whole thing. Third there is Vera (Arta Dobroshi), a woman immigrant from Moldova and married to the man overrun by Al. To tell you much more of the plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this is a heavy-duty dramatic movie that raises a lot of good points about guilt, remorse, and personal responsability. At one point, Al starts to understand the desparate position that he is getting in/already is in, and it overwhelms him, crying out ""I've always tried to do the right thing!"" I thought that writer-director Catherine Corsini did an excellent job shaping the characters in the movie, walking a fine line between bringing drama but never becoming melodramatic. Next, there is a secondary theme in the movie pertaining to illegal immigrants in France (in this case: a Moldovian community in Paris). Separate and apart from how one feels about illegal immgration, Corsini makes the point that these people are humans too. Last, the movie brings some great performances. For me Raphal Personnaz in the role of Al is the breakout role of the movie, and I think we have not seen the last of him.As always, the DVD-of-the-Month comes with a bonus shortie. This month brings an excellent 14 min. feature called ""The Piano Tuner"", in which the main character pretends to be blind (for reasons too long to explain here) and then at one point witnesses something horrible. What can he do? Watch! Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for a top notch foreign movie which is surprisingly accessible despite its heavy undercurrent, you cannot go wrong with ""Three Worlds"".

The boss likes him so much that he is giving him a 25% stake in the company, making him the manager and all this when he marries the boss's daughter. So everything is coming up roses. Then on a night out with two colleagues and alleged friends, he hits a pedestrian, and fearful of the consequences he drives off.The accident is observed by a woman Juliette (Clotilde Hesme - `Mysteries of Lisbon') and she goes to help. Being the caring sort she goes to the Hospital and helps trace the victim's wife Vera (Arta Dobroshi - `The Silence of Lorna'). But Al also has a conscience and realises he must find out how the man is doing. At the hospital he runs into Juliette and she recognises him. Meanwhile Vera's husband is deteriorating as his hospital bills mount; as he is an illegal or `clandestine' immigrant from Moldova he is therefore not entitled to free healthcare. But as Juliette gets more involved, things become increasingly complicated and the line between what is right and wrong extremely blurred all leading her and those involved to be forced to make life changing decisions.This is one of those films that tackles some unpleasant truths especially around economic migration, which happens the World over. Director Catherine Corsini has used an imagined scenario to look at the human psyche in order to unpick legal rights from moral obligations and has done so in an extremely well made film. There are some things that I thought were a bit of a push, like Al having all his eggs in one basket with regards to his job, marriage, home and car all wrapped up in the hands of his boss/Father in law, but that is not unheard of. Al is played by Raphael Personnaz - `The Princess of Montpensier' and `Anna Karenina' , and he makes it completely believable.All the performances are excellent and the music is spot on but works so well with the plot that it is almost background throughout. The location shots and action are all convincing, but most of all it is extremely compelling and watchable, at 100 minutes it is one of those that flies by. The DVD from Film Movement, whom I received this from for review purposes , also contains a short film called `The Piano Tuner' which is also in French with good sub titles and is also rather good. All in all an excellent film that I find easily able to recommend, especially to fans of independent European cinema.",4,"Challenging story of guilt, honour, immigration and wealth.",1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,2450,"['Al', 'man', 'who', 'worked', 'way', 'bottom', 'Paris', 'auto', 'garage', 'boss', 'so', 'much', 'giving', '25', '%', 'stake', 'company', 'making', 'manager', 'when', 'boss', 'daughter', 'everything', 'coming', 'up', 'roses', 'Then', 'night', 'out', 'two', 'colleagues', 'alleged', 'friends', 'pedestrian', 'fearful', 'consequences', 'off.The', 'accident', 'observed', 'woman', 'Juliette', 'Clotilde', 'Hesme', 'Mysteries', 'Lisbon', 'help', 'Being', 'caring', 'sort', 'Hospital', 'trace', 'victim', 'wife', 'Vera', 'Arta', 'Dobroshi', 'Silence', 'Lorna', 'Al', 'also', 'conscience', 'must', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'man', 'doing', 'hospital', 'Juliette', 'Meanwhile', 'Vera', 'husband', 'deteriorating', 'hospital', 'bills', 'mount', 'illegal', 'clandestine', 'immigrant', 'Moldova', 'therefore', 'not', 'entitled', 'free', 'healthcare', 'Juliette', 'more', 'involved', 'things', 'become', 'increasingly', 'complicated', 'line', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'extremely', 'blurred', 'leading', 'involved', 'be', 'forced', 'make', 'life', 'changing', 'decisions.This', 'one', 'films', 'unpleasant', 'truths', 'especially', 'economic', 'migration', 'World', 'Director', 'Catherine', 'Corsini', 'used', 'imagined', 'scenario', 'look', 'human', 'psyche', 'order', 'unpick', 'legal', 'rights', 'moral', 'obligations', 'done', 'so', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'are', 'things', 'thought', 'were', 'bit', 'push', 'Al', 'having', 'eggs', 'one', 'basket', 'regards', 'job', 'marriage', 'home', 'car', 'wrapped', 'up', 'hands', 'boss/Father', 'law', 'not', 'unheard', 'Al', 'played', 'Raphael', 'Personnaz', 'Princess', 'Montpensier', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'completely', 'believable.All', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'music', 'spot', 'so', 'well', 'plot', 'almost', 'background', 'location', 'shots', 'action', 'are', 'convincing', 'most', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'watchable', '100', 'minutes', 'one', 'flies', 'DVD', 'Film', 'Movement', 'whom', 'received', 'review', 'purposes', 'also', 'short', 'film', 'called', 'Piano', 'Tuner', 'also', 'French', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', 'also', 'rather', 'good', 'excellent', 'film', 'find', 'easily', 'able', 'recommend', 'especially', 'fans', 'independent', 'European', 'cinema']",N/A
1637636,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00BQNSK0W,trebe,"[0, 0]","Catherine Corsini's Three Worlds (2012) examines the aftermath of a hit and run accident, focusing on three parties, the driver, a witness, and the victim's wife and family.  It's an interesting story that doesn't follow conventional lines, as a tragic event draws a number of people together.Alan Sheffer (Raphael Personnaz) is a car salesman in Paris, and after a night of partying with a couple his coworkers, he accidentally hits a man crossing the street, with his Mercedes.  He stops, but after some hesitation, drives away.  From the window of her apartment, Juliette Seznick (Clotilde Hesme) observes the accident, and also sees Al's face.  She runs out into the street to try and help the victim, who is taken to the hospital in critical condition.A concerned Juliette learns that the injured man named Adrian Drodsta, is an illegal immigrant from Moldavia.  She manages to contact his wife Vera (Arta Dobroshi), and informs her what has happened.  Juliette and meets Vera at the hospital, and becomes close to her, and her family.  Sheffer is about to marry Marion Testard (Adele Haenel), the daughter of the owner of the car dealership, that he has just become a partner in.  Although Al and his friends refuse to go to the police, guilt compels him to visit the victim in the hospital, where he is observed by Juliette, who also manages to track him down.  Things become very complicated and more intriguing, when Juliette, who is trusted by both Al and the Drodsta family, is unexpectedly drawn into becoming an intermediary between them.Three Worlds deals with the subject of hit and run with some sense of realism, as lives are changed in a split second, and panic and the desire to escape become overpowering.  The characters mostly act in credible ways, although Juliette, who is three months pregnant, has a tendency to become too involved.  The acting performances are very solid, capturing the anguish of the various characters, as nearly everyone suffers some pain.This film is for those who appreciate a mostly realistic tale, tinged with emotion, and a dash of suspense.  Various subjects and themes are touched on, but the film doesn't spend time developing them.  The spoken language is French, with English subtitles.  Like most Film Movement releases, this one includes a short film as a bonus.  ""The Piano Tuner"" (L'accordeur) is provocative story, with a tense cliffhanger ending.A complimentary DVD was provided for review purposes.",4,"an engrossing and thoughtful drama, that avoids many of the standard clich&eacute;s...",1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,2462,"['Catherine', 'Corsini', 'Three', 'Worlds', '2012', 'aftermath', 'hit', 'run', 'accident', 'focusing', 'three', 'parties', 'driver', 'witness', 'victim', 'wife', 'family', 'interesting', 'story', ""n't"", 'follow', 'conventional', 'lines', 'tragic', 'event', 'number', 'people', 'together.Alan', 'Sheffer', 'Raphael', 'Personnaz', 'car', 'salesman', 'Paris', 'night', 'partying', 'couple', 'coworkers', 'accidentally', 'man', 'crossing', 'street', 'Mercedes', 'hesitation', 'away', 'window', 'apartment', 'Juliette', 'Seznick', 'Clotilde', 'Hesme', 'accident', 'also', 'Al', 'face', 'out', 'street', 'try', 'help', 'victim', 'who', 'taken', 'hospital', 'critical', 'condition.A', 'concerned', 'Juliette', 'injured', 'man', 'named', 'Adrian', 'Drodsta', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'Moldavia', 'contact', 'wife', 'Vera', 'Arta', 'Dobroshi', 'what', 'happened', 'Juliette', 'meets', 'Vera', 'hospital', 'close', 'family', 'Sheffer', 'marry', 'Marion', 'Testard', 'Adele', 'Haenel', 'daughter', 'owner', 'car', 'dealership', 'just', 'become', 'partner', 'Al', 'friends', 'refuse', 'go', 'police', 'guilt', 'compels', 'visit', 'victim', 'hospital', 'where', 'observed', 'Juliette', 'who', 'also', 'track', 'down', 'Things', 'become', 'very', 'complicated', 'more', 'intriguing', 'when', 'Juliette', 'who', 'trusted', 'Al', 'Drodsta', 'family', 'unexpectedly', 'drawn', 'becoming', 'intermediary', 'them.Three', 'Worlds', 'deals', 'subject', 'hit', 'run', 'sense', 'realism', 'lives', 'are', 'changed', 'split', 'second', 'panic', 'desire', 'escape', 'become', 'overpowering', 'characters', 'mostly', 'act', 'credible', 'ways', 'Juliette', 'who', 'three', 'months', 'pregnant', 'tendency', 'become', 'too', 'involved', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'solid', 'capturing', 'anguish', 'various', 'characters', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'pain.This', 'film', 'who', 'appreciate', 'mostly', 'realistic', 'tale', 'tinged', 'emotion', 'dash', 'suspense', 'Various', 'subjects', 'themes', 'are', 'touched', 'film', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'developing', 'spoken', 'language', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'most', 'Film', 'Movement', 'one', 'short', 'film', 'bonus', 'Piano', 'Tuner', ""L'accordeur"", 'provocative', 'story', 'tense', 'cliffhanger', 'ending.A', 'complimentary', 'DVD', 'was', 'provided', 'review', 'purposes']",N/A
1637637,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00BQNSK0W,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Three Worlds"" (""Trois mondes"") starts with a hit and run accident, but Catherine Corsini's latest film is not exactly a crime thriller. The film's complicated story unfolds more like a character study, and we are to take a closer look at the psychological changes in humans in unusual situations.Young and handsome Al (Raphal Personnaz) is getting married to a wealthy company owner's daughter in ten days. He thinks his future is so bright until he, while driving car while under influence of liquor, gets involved with an accident that severely injures Adrian (Rasha Bukvic), an illegal immigrant from Moldova. Terrified, Al immediately leaves the scene of the accident without trying to help. His friends (who were in the car) persuade him not to go to the police.It is Juliette (Clotilde Hesme) who witnessed the accident and called 911. In a rather contrived fashion (that I would not reveal here) Juliette establishes an emotional bond with the victim's wife Vera (Arta Dobroshi), and Al the victimizer, too, though Vera doesn't know it.Three characters representing three worlds, or social terrain of contemporary France, consist of the main story that seems a bit artificial. All players did superb jobs in playing these characters that have their own social backgrounds, problems to solve, and reality to face.I think I understand the film's point, but because of the melodramatic storyline and I just find it hard to take it seriously. The film is worth a look, though, for the fine performances from the leads.",3,Fine Character Study with a Story Too Melodramatic,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,1522,"['Three', 'Worlds', 'Trois', 'mondes', 'hit', 'run', 'accident', 'Catherine', 'Corsini', 'latest', 'film', 'not', 'exactly', 'crime', 'thriller', 'film', 'complicated', 'story', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'are', 'take', 'closer', 'look', 'psychological', 'changes', 'humans', 'unusual', 'situations.Young', 'handsome', 'Al', 'Raphal', 'Personnaz', 'getting', 'married', 'wealthy', 'company', 'owner', 'daughter', 'ten', 'days', 'future', 'so', 'bright', 'driving', 'car', 'influence', 'liquor', 'involved', 'accident', 'severely', 'Adrian', 'Rasha', 'Bukvic', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'Moldova', 'Terrified', 'Al', 'immediately', 'scene', 'accident', 'trying', 'help', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'car', 'persuade', 'not', 'go', 'police.It', 'Juliette', 'Clotilde', 'Hesme', 'who', 'witnessed', 'accident', 'called', '911', 'rather', 'contrived', 'fashion', 'would', 'not', 'reveal', 'here', 'Juliette', 'emotional', 'bond', 'victim', 'wife', 'Vera', 'Arta', 'Dobroshi', 'Al', 'victimizer', 'too', 'Vera', ""n't"", 'know', 'it.Three', 'characters', 'representing', 'three', 'worlds', 'social', 'terrain', 'contemporary', 'France', 'consist', 'main', 'story', 'bit', 'artificial', 'players', 'did', 'superb', 'jobs', 'playing', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'social', 'backgrounds', 'problems', 'solve', 'reality', 'face.I', 'think', 'understand', 'film', 'point', 'melodramatic', 'storyline', 'just', 'find', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'film', 'look', 'though', 'fine', 'performances', 'leads']",N/A
