The film has really bizarre characters, which will appeal to and hold the attention of your most finicky movie watchers.  I think there are very few people who won't like this.  The over analyzing and sensitive types might not connect to the characters in the beginning of the film, or even feel concerned they're watching a disturbing movie.  By half way through, even they'll be on board, as the film has a great message and the ""sinister"" characters are beyond lovable, they're irresistible.This is great for the whole family.  Of course really young viewers may need a hand held in a few parts.  With the luxury of the home theater, you could pause it, and let the youngsters have a break or something explained.  I would say most 5+, will really enjoy this, and not find it unsettling.  There's enough explosions and kiddie style drama to entertain the middle school brother as well.So great to find a film that is entertaining for young and old alike, and leaves the audience with a good feeling.  Far too rare, as too many feel good movies leave you bored or with a sickly sweet feeling.

It made me laugh and it made me cry, and that was so needed!The film is kind of crazy but then again, it works so brilliantly because it isn't ashamed of its apparent lack of logic.  The film centers around a super villain, Gru.  Gru is pretty dumb actually.  He wants funding for from the secret villain organization for his latest venture into villainy (he wants to steal the moon) but all funding is going to some new kid, Vector; a young and ambitious and obnoxious super villain who happens to have ties to the agency.  Gru makes it his personal quest to outdo Vector.  Rather ridiculously, Gru thinks that adopting three orphan girls who sell cookies will help him in his quest (like I said, this doesn't make the most sense, but it embraces that quality, which really helps).  What Gru finds though, is that these three little brats are getting in the way of his villainous ways.In the end he needs to decide if he wants to be `superbad' or `superdad'.I know that a lot of people have had issues with the films construction and overall plot.  It is out there, believe me, but it SOOOOOO works.  The greatest thing I can say about this movie is that it is really, really funny.  I mean, in a world where animated features are determined to take the place of live actions dramas to such an extreme that nearly every animated feature made has to involve such mature themes to target the parents over the children, `Despicable Me' entertained my daughter to ridiculous heights.  It knows that it has to bring the funny to serve its purpose.  On top of that, it sprinkled in the needed suruppy cheese in order to get a tear to fall, but it did it in a way that poked fun at its own manipulations.This film has fun, and so you have fun with it too.I loved it, wholeheartedly.

We've seen it three times in the past two weeks!Universal Studios did an excellent job making a film that will appeal to the masses.Meet Gru - he wants to be a super villain.  He'd love to be the evilest man on earth - but he can't do it alone.  He has Dr. Nefario and the minions...but he also needs the help of 3 orphan girls if he wants to succeed.  The girls bring lots of chaos and humor with them.Some little kids are easily scared by bad guys on screen.  But no worries with this movie.  Gru WANTS to be evil, but he's not, really.  The kids in the movie aren't even afraid of him.  Universal Studios throws in a lot of scenes to make little ones giggle, such as physical comedy, potty humor, and of course those cute little minions.But they don't forget us adults.  The plot is deep enough to hold our interest, and they throw in things that most kids will miss, like simple physics, clever wordplay in English AND Spanish, and amusing details in the background of the action.  There's also a funny scene where Gru moans about how terrible children's books are.The movie pulls at the heartstrings a little, but not so much that it becomes too sweet.  There's always humor at appropriate moments to keep things light.If you have young children, you should definitely watch this movie.

Despicable Me is about a super villain named Gru. Now our anti hero is over the peak, he is getting older and younger super villains with more outlandish gadgets and weapons are rising up to surpass him, the evil bank will no longer lend him money for his plots and life generally suck for Gru, enter three orphan girl which Gru adopts. (He needs them for his plot to make the world's biggest thefts though explaining in detail why would be to much of a spoiler.) Now Gru who used to delight in crushing children's dreams and steal candy from babies have to deal with being a single dad and the only help he have in the matter is a fellow mad scientist even nuttier than he is and a army of small, yellow creatures that serves as his evil minions.This is the kind of movie that works for everyone. Me and my hubby sat watching it and laughed until we gasped for breath, there is definitely enough there for adults to like, all from a plot that any comic book geek would love (who would not love to see any given super villain suddenly having to function as a father for three little girls?) to little hints here and there that go right over the heads of the kiddies but which is very amusing for the adults. At the same time the plot is easy to follow, goofy and the characters have allot of charm, this really is a movie the whole family can enjoy.Animation wise this movie is passable, it get the job done, it is definitely not bad but the characters do look like plastic and this movie just do not live up to the standards set by Dreamworks and Pixar and this is the only reason Despicable Me do not get a 5 rating from me, it looks like it was produced ten years ago, computer animation have gotten so much further since then, however let me say again that the animation is not bad, and for many this would not be an issue at all. The rest of the production, voice acting, music, sound effects, all of it is top notch.Despicable Me is a cute and charming movie about a villain who learns how to love. I really enjoy this movie and I think it would appeal to a wide variety of people, this movie is intended for children but it is definitely not only for children. This is a good addition to the whole superheroes and supervillains taken out of their element theme that have been going on as of late and I do warmly recommend it.",4,Fun movie sure to please everyone.,1317513600,"10 2, 2011",2011,2536,"['got', 'movie', 'whim', 'when', 'blu', 'ray', 'had', 'ended', 'up', 'bargain', 'bins', 'had', 'avoided', 'while', 'due', 'movie', 'getting', 'very', 'bad', 'reviews', 'here', 'Norway', 'now', 'regret', 'not', 'seeing', 'sooner', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'super', 'villain', 'named', 'Gru', 'Now', 'anti', 'hero', 'peak', 'getting', 'older', 'younger', 'super', 'more', 'outlandish', 'gadgets', 'weapons', 'are', 'rising', 'up', 'surpass', 'evil', 'bank', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'lend', 'money', 'plots', 'life', 'generally', 'suck', 'Gru', 'enter', 'three', 'girl', 'Gru', 'adopts', 'plot', 'make', 'world', 'biggest', 'thefts', 'explaining', 'detail', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'spoiler', 'Now', 'Gru', 'who', 'used', 'delight', 'crushing', 'children', 'dreams', 'steal', 'candy', 'babies', 'have', 'deal', 'being', 'single', 'dad', 'only', 'help', 'have', 'matter', 'fellow', 'mad', 'scientist', 'even', 'nuttier', 'army', 'small', 'yellow', 'creatures', 'evil', 'minions.This', 'kind', 'movie', 'everyone', 'Me', 'hubby', 'sat', 'watching', 'laughed', 'gasped', 'breath', 'definitely', 'enough', 'there', 'adults', 'like', 'plot', 'comic', 'book', 'geek', 'would', 'love', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'love', 'see', 'given', 'super', 'villain', 'suddenly', 'having', 'function', 'father', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'little', 'hints', 'here', 'there', 'go', 'right', 'heads', 'kiddies', 'very', 'amusing', 'adults', 'same', 'time', 'plot', 'easy', 'follow', 'goofy', 'characters', 'have', 'allot', 'charm', 'really', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy.Animation', 'wise', 'movie', 'passable', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'definitely', 'not', 'bad', 'characters', 'do', 'look', 'plastic', 'movie', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'standards', 'set', 'Dreamworks', 'Pixar', 'only', 'reason', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'do', 'not', 'get', '5', 'rating', 'was', 'produced', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'computer', 'animation', 'have', 'gotten', 'so', 'much', 'further', 'then', 'however', 'let', 'say', 'again', 'animation', 'not', 'bad', 'many', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'issue', 'rest', 'production', 'voice', 'acting', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'top', 'notch.Despicable', 'Me', 'cute', 'charming', 'movie', 'villain', 'who', 'how', 'love', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'think', 'would', 'appeal', 'wide', 'variety', 'people', 'movie', 'intended', 'children', 'definitely', 'not', 'only', 'children', 'good', 'addition', 'whole', 'superheroes', 'supervillains', 'taken', 'element', 'theme', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'late', 'do', 'warmly', 'recommend']",N/A

1301737,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B002ZG97E2,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 4]","When I first saw trailers for Despicable Me, I wasn't interested at all. Even though the main character was a bad guy, nothing about it looked appealing to me, so I passed on watching it until I had nothing else to watch one day, and finally gave it a chance. It's not a great movie by any means- definitely nothing that could give Pixar or some of Dreamworks' select good movies a run for their money...but you know what? This is the best full-length cartoon I've ever seen. Yeah, I said it: cartoon, not animated feature. Anyone who loves watching Wile E. Coyote try to capture the Road Runner with different kinds of weapons and gadgets will enjoy Despicable Me. It's just plain fun, and something I appreciate them trying instead of a Best Animated Picture contender, or Pop Culture References: The Movie. However, it's sadly held back from being something greater.Gru is the self-proclaimed world's greatest villain, stealing such well-known monuments as the Statue of Liberty (from Las Vegas), but someone out there is stealing his thunder. A much younger villain, Vector, is having better luck by stealing the pyramids, and as a result, the secret bank that supports successful bad guys isn't going to be helping out Gru any more. To make matters worse, Vector also managed to steal a Shrink Ray, which was a key ingredient in Gru's plan to steal the moon and be #1 once again. The only people able to access Vector's fortress are girl scouts, who also happen to be orphans, and Gru quickly adopts them in order to get the Shrink Ray and fulfill a childhood dream of going to the moon [and taking it].The story isn't very original, and even borrows a lot of points from other fairly recent animated movies like The Incredibles and Meet the Robinsons, but where it shines is the comedy of Gru vs Vector. Watching these guys try to outdo eachother was comic gold, and I wished that more of the movie focused on this instead of the sweet lil' orphans that seemed to be forced into the plot. Just when Gru and Vector were having a great fight, we'd cut back to the orphan girls and their problems. Apart from them being the Cindy Lou Who to Gru's Grinch, there's not much use for them (well, aside from the infamous unicorn bit). Two of the three are generic and forgettable, and I'm sure there were other ways the writers could've gotten around using them as a way of getting Gru into Vector's lair. It doesn't ruin the movie by any means, but I wanted to see more of those two buffoons messing with eachother. There were times where I was actually laughing out loud, and that's rare for me. The Minions were a pretty good addition, and kids will love these guys, especially when they start using a copying machine.The picture and audio on the blu-ray are both perfect, and I was surprised that a non-Pixar film got such great treatment in these departments. The AVC BD50 encode is a sight to behold, and there were many times when I was rewinding the movie just to pay attention to every little detail in some scenes. It doesn't hurt that the art direction was really good too. And if you have a good home theater setup, just wait until the scene where Gru shoots missiles at Vector- hearing those suckers go off in every direction is awesome. Unfortunately the audio is only available in English, with subtitles in English, Spanish and French are included.Regarding the special features, the list on the back of the box is HUGE, but they went with quantity over quality. The best of the bunch for me were the cookie recipes, interviews with the voice actors, and to an extent, the commentary track. The problem is that the Minions were such a hit, that they were shoved into nearly every feature here, even a picture-in-picture track that lets you shoot Minions at the screen. The commentary track was genuinely good, but even there the Minions were crowbarred in and damper the enjoyment. The rest of the features are your standard stuff- an EPK featurette with people involved with making the movie, a look at the world of the movie, a look at the making of the soundtrack, games, etc. And of course, there are 3 short movies with the Minions.Despicable Me is an enjoyable movie for kids and adults, especially for those who grew up with the Warner Bros. cartoons, and I can't help but wonder how much better the movie could've been if the orphans were removed or less of a focus. Maybe if a sequel comes out, we'll get a true bad guy bonanza, though I'd settle for 5 minute shorts of Gru vs Vector as well.",4,Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck would be proud.,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,4515,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailers', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'Even', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'nothing', 'looked', 'appealing', 'so', 'passed', 'watching', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'one', 'day', 'finally', 'gave', 'chance', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'means-', 'definitely', 'nothing', 'could', 'give', 'Pixar', 'Dreamworks', 'select', 'good', 'movies', 'run', 'money', 'know', 'what', 'best', 'full-length', 'cartoon', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Yeah', 'said', 'cartoon', 'not', 'animated', 'feature', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watching', 'Wile', 'E.', 'Coyote', 'try', 'capture', 'Road', 'Runner', 'different', 'kinds', 'weapons', 'gadgets', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'something', 'appreciate', 'trying', 'instead', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Picture', 'contender', 'Pop', 'Culture', 'References', 'Movie', 'However', 'sadly', 'held', 'back', 'being', 'something', 'greater.Gru', 'self-proclaimed', 'world', 'greatest', 'villain', 'stealing', 'such', 'well-known', 'monuments', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'someone', 'stealing', 'thunder', 'much', 'younger', 'villain', 'Vector', 'having', 'better', 'luck', 'stealing', 'pyramids', 'result', 'secret', 'bank', 'successful', 'bad', 'guys', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'helping', 'out', 'Gru', 'more', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Vector', 'also', 'managed', 'steal', 'Shrink', 'Ray', 'was', 'key', 'ingredient', 'Gru', 'plan', 'steal', 'moon', 'be', '1', 'once', 'again', 'only', 'people', 'able', 'access', 'Vector', 'fortress', 'are', 'girl', 'scouts', 'who', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'orphans', 'Gru', 'quickly', 'order', 'get', 'Shrink', 'Ray', 'fulfill', 'childhood', 'dream', 'going', 'moon', '[', 'taking', '.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'very', 'original', 'even', 'lot', 'points', 'other', 'fairly', 'recent', 'animated', 'movies', 'Incredibles', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'where', 'comedy', 'Gru', 'vs', 'Vector', 'Watching', 'guys', 'try', 'outdo', 'eachother', 'was', 'comic', 'gold', 'wished', 'more', 'movie', 'focused', 'instead', 'sweet', 'lil', 'orphans', 'seemed', 'be', 'forced', 'plot', 'Just', 'when', 'Gru', 'Vector', 'were', 'having', 'great', 'fight', ""'d"", 'cut', 'back', 'orphan', 'girls', 'problems', 'Apart', 'being', 'Cindy', 'Lou', 'Who', 'Gru', 'Grinch', 'not', 'much', 'use', 'well', 'aside', 'infamous', 'unicorn', 'bit', 'Two', 'three', 'are', 'generic', 'forgettable', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'other', 'ways', 'writers', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'using', 'way', 'getting', 'Gru', 'Vector', 'lair', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', 'means', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'two', 'buffoons', 'messing', 'eachother', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'was', 'actually', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'rare', 'Minions', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'addition', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'guys', 'especially', 'when', 'start', 'using', 'copying', 'machine.The', 'picture', 'audio', 'blu-ray', 'are', 'perfect', 'was', 'surprised', 'non-Pixar', 'film', 'got', 'such', 'great', 'treatment', 'departments', 'AVC', 'BD50', 'encode', 'sight', 'behold', 'were', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'rewinding', 'movie', 'just', 'pay', 'attention', 'little', 'detail', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'art', 'direction', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'too', 'have', 'good', 'home', 'theater', 'setup', 'just', 'wait', 'scene', 'where', 'Gru', 'missiles', 'Vector-', 'hearing', 'suckers', 'go', 'off', 'direction', 'awesome', 'Unfortunately', 'audio', 'only', 'available', 'English', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'are', 'included.Regarding', 'special', 'features', 'list', 'back', 'box', 'HUGE', 'went', 'quantity', 'quality', 'best', 'bunch', 'were', 'cookie', 'recipes', 'interviews', 'voice', 'actors', 'extent', 'commentary', 'track', 'problem', 'Minions', 'were', 'hit', 'were', 'shoved', 'nearly', 'feature', 'here', 'even', 'picture-in-picture', 'track', 'shoot', 'Minions', 'screen', 'commentary', 'track', 'was', 'genuinely', 'good', 'even', 'Minions', 'were', 'crowbarred', 'damper', 'enjoyment', 'rest', 'features', 'are', 'standard', 'stuff-', 'EPK', 'featurette', 'people', 'involved', 'making', 'movie', 'look', 'world', 'movie', 'look', 'making', 'soundtrack', 'games', 'etc', 'course', 'are', '3', 'short', 'movies', 'Minions.Despicable', 'Me', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'kids', 'adults', 'especially', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'cartoons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'orphans', 'were', 'removed', 'less', 'focus', 'Maybe', 'sequel', 'out', ""'ll"", 'get', 'true', 'bad', 'guy', 'bonanza', ""'d"", 'settle', '5', 'minute', 'shorts', 'Gru', 'vs', 'Vector', 'as', 'well']",N/A

1301792,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B002ZG97E2,Brian Maitland,"[2, 4]","OK, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Despicable Me a lot. This says a lot as I find Steve Carrell completely overrated as a ""lead"" comic actor (sorry, don't get the appeal at all of ""The Office""). In this, though, the accent he comes up with to voice the ""Despicable Me"" character of Gru is brilliant. Visually the movie is very very cool with crazy-looking vehicles and just a sort of art deco look to the backdrops.Yet ultimately there were some odd choices. I felt the mother character (voiced by Julie Andrews) was a waste. It was in there to explain how Gru became what he is but I felt it took valuable screen time away from what was fun about the movie--the relationship between Gru and the three orphan girls he adopts (one of which is voiced by comic genius-in-the-making iCarly's Miranda Cosgrove).I also thought the cool freeze ray and shrink guns worked but the squid and piranha ray guns were jokes that fell super flat. Also, the massive weaponry set up to protect Gru's nemesis, Vector, was just dumb. Why not have something just as funny as the freeze or shrink ray? It's like the comic writers gave up half way through on that.Throw in the fact this was made for 3D and there are plenty of 3D moments I found just in there for affect.The little yellow minions are cute and fun. Maybe they needed no explanation but I was left throughout the movie wondering, what are they supposed to be--mini-Twinkies? Yellow Mexican jumping beans? Also, why did some have one eyeball and some two eyeballs. What was up with the strands of Homer Simpson hair on their heads? Why were there so many of them? What was up with the goggles, overalls and the whole welder look? Was it a parody of Flashdance or some Soviet era industrial joke?These are not vital questions to know the answers to, and I do hate kids' movies that explain too much but could the writers not have given us something to chew on for that? I just thought the yellow minions, as funny as they were, were just plain out of sync with the whole ""super villain living in the Boris Karloff-like home"" vibe.To top it off, the extras seem to want to sell you the video game for the movie (and also have a lame game on it you can play on your computer). The ""Making Of"" extra is pretty good, but even there they don't explain what the deal was with the minions?Lastly, the title is terrible. Gru, if anything, is not ""despicable"" really. He's more a cartoon villain (well, it is a animation after all). The cover of the DVD has one of the minions front and center, but in the movie they are not the focus at all as they are more the comic relief.I don't know.

Even so, I was pretty curious- could this film live up to expectations? And what of the 3-D aspects & the child friendly aspects? More importantly... will the parents wish for a freeze ray to aim at themselves?Steve Carell plays Gru, a supervillain who is determined to make it big. Unfortunately he's hampered by two things: one is the new supervillian Vector who foils Gru at every turn & the other is that in order to undertake his latest venture, Gru must get a loan... which he's almost immediately denied for. Gru attempts to steal a shrink ray to prove to the bank that he's no slouch, but just as it is in his grasp it is stolen by the geeky Vector. Finding no way into Vector's not so secret hideout, Gru decides to sneak his way in via three adorable little girls that he adopts with the intention of discarding once his plan is finished. What he doesn't plan on is actually falling for them.I screened this to see if my niece would enjoy it (ok, I admit it- I was curious) & I was happy to find that the movie is actually pretty cute. The animation is nicely done & I liked Gru's interactions with the kids. Agnes has to be one of my favorite animation kids since watching Boo in Monsters Inc. Who wouldn't giggle at a little girl who mistakes cheese puffs for caterpillars & manages to dye a ferocious dog pink? The story moves along nicely & there's even a little bit of adult humor in there. (If you watch closely there's a little dig at Lehman Brothers early on in the film.) The 3-D is also nicely done- it manages to put in enough cool gimmicks to look impressive, but without overly sacrificing credibility. (Any sight gimmicks are done as part of the plot.) It isn't quite up to par with how Avatar's 3-D was, but let's face it- those are some hard shoes to fill 3-D wise.However where the movie falls short is via the voice talent. Everyone does a decent job, but I can't help but feel like Carell was overdoing it a little with his fake Russian accent & I would have liked to have seen more Kristen Wiig. OK, not exactly a voice talent issue but she was woefully underused in this film. Plus I'm a bit miffed that you basically see most of the best parts of the movie via the commercials & video clips on the web. (Although it might be a good thing- I can watch the ""IT'S SO FLUFFY!!!"" scene again without shelling out the bucks to the theater.)The bottom line is that this film is pretty easygoing when it comes to kids & you can rest assured that there's really no objectionable content in this movie. Parents can also breathe a sigh of relief that they'll be just as entertained. If you can, I recommend paying for the 3-D; it's worth seeing it, especially for the end credits where you get to see minion hijinks.This might not be the best kid's film to hit the theaters this summer (nothing can really compete against Toy Story 3), but it is worth seeing.",4,Surprisingly cute!,1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,3058,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest-', 'commercial', 'spots', 'were', 'pretty', 'cute', 'first', 'grew', 'just', 'tired', 'most', 'other', 'people', 'there', 'when', 'played', 'millionth', 'time', 'Even', 'so', 'was', 'pretty', 'curious-', 'could', 'film', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'what', '3-D', 'aspects', 'child', 'friendly', 'aspects', 'More', 'importantly', 'will', 'parents', 'wish', 'freeze', 'ray', 'aim', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Gru', 'supervillain', 'who', 'determined', 'make', 'big', 'Unfortunately', 'hampered', 'two', 'things', 'one', 'new', 'supervillian', 'Vector', 'who', 'Gru', 'turn', 'other', 'order', 'undertake', 'latest', 'venture', 'Gru', 'must', 'get', 'loan', 'almost', 'immediately', 'denied', 'Gru', 'steal', 'shrink', 'ray', 'prove', 'bank', 'slouch', 'just', 'grasp', 'stolen', 'geeky', 'Vector', 'Finding', 'way', 'Vector', 'not', 'so', 'secret', 'hideout', 'Gru', 'sneak', 'way', 'three', 'adorable', 'little', 'girls', 'intention', 'discarding', 'once', 'plan', 'finished', 'What', ""n't"", 'plan', 'actually', 'falling', 'them.I', 'screened', 'see', 'niece', 'would', 'enjoy', 'ok', 'admit', 'it-', 'was', 'curious', 'was', 'happy', 'find', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'cute', 'animation', 'nicely', 'done', 'liked', 'Gru', 'interactions', 'kids', 'Agnes', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'animation', 'kids', 'watching', 'Boo', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'giggle', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'cheese', 'puffs', 'caterpillars', 'manages', 'dye', 'ferocious', 'dog', 'pink', 'story', 'moves', 'nicely', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'adult', 'humor', 'there', 'watch', 'closely', 'little', 'dig', 'Lehman', 'Brothers', 'early', 'film', '3-D', 'also', 'nicely', 'done-', 'put', 'enough', 'cool', 'gimmicks', 'look', 'impressive', 'overly', 'sacrificing', 'credibility', 'Any', 'sight', 'gimmicks', 'are', 'done', 'part', 'plot', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'par', 'how', 'Avatar', '3-D', 'was', 'let', 'face', 'it-', 'are', 'hard', 'shoes', 'fill', '3-D', 'wise.However', 'where', 'movie', 'short', 'voice', 'talent', 'Everyone', 'decent', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'Carell', 'was', 'overdoing', 'little', 'fake', 'Russian', 'accent', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'OK', 'not', 'exactly', 'voice', 'talent', 'issue', 'was', 'woefully', 'underused', 'film', ""'m"", 'bit', 'miffed', 'basically', 'see', 'most', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'commercials', 'video', 'clips', 'web', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'thing-', 'can', 'watch', 'IT', 'SO', 'FLUFFY', 'scene', 'again', 'shelling', 'out', 'bucks', 'theater', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'pretty', 'easygoing', 'when', 'kids', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'really', 'objectionable', 'content', 'movie', 'Parents', 'can', 'also', 'breathe', 'sigh', 'relief', ""'ll"", 'be', 'just', 'as', 'entertained', 'can', 'recommend', 'paying', '3-D', 'worth', 'seeing', 'especially', 'end', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'minion', 'hijinks.This', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'kid', 'film', 'hit', 'theaters', 'summer', 'nothing', 'can', 'really', 'compete', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

1301840,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B002ZG97E2,Chris Kennison,"[1, 3]","In the beginning of DESPICABLE ME, the premise of the movie went straight over my kids heads. They couldn't put their minds around the fact that the lead character, GRU, was a thief of not money, or jewels, or cars, but of HUGE NATIONAL MONUMENTS like THE PYRAMIDs of Egypt. For the first 20 minutes of the film, I was under the impression that DESPICABLE ME just might be a miss on the kids likeability factor.Then, the heavy premise of the film sort of changed. Once GRU, sets his sights on a theft that most evil nemesis' would be proud of and no BOND VILLAIN would ever dream of, the movie returned to the fool-proof method of getting through to kids... it became FUN. It became light and the characters involved started having fun and then the movie did something even better, it attempted to touch our hearts by inserting Margo, Edith & Agnes, three orphans who have given up on adoption and are just intent on being there for each other.So when GRU seems an opportunity to use the 3 orphans to assist in his planned large scale heist, he adopts the kids and the movie ceased being just any ordinary film. It became something tangible and fun and something that the audience could relate to.On a side note, as funny as Steve Carell's GRU was, Jason Segel's character, VECTOR, was an absolute stitch. A squirrly little supervillain who competes with GRU to see who can pull off the biggest heist and get the biggest credit from the crime world, and most importantly please his crime boss father.DESPICABLE ME is an absolute must for any collection because this movie was overshadowed at the box office, but will only get better with time.

1301841,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG97E2,Chris Pandolfi,"[165, 197]","While not quite as wondrous or challenging as a Disney/Pixar film, ""Despicable Me"" is still a lot of fun, able to make audiences laugh without having to sacrifice story or character development. It's also one of the few animated films to not entertain the idea of heroes - it merely distinguishes between evil villains and not-so-evil villains, the latter apparently capable of good deeds despite their propensity for hatching diabolical schemes. Such a person is Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), who looks like a pointy-nosed Fester Addams and speaks in a pseudo-Russian accent so delightfully phony, it only adds to his charm. His goal has always been to become the world's greatest super villain, but as the film progresses, we realize that, underneath it all, he's actually a pretty nice guy.He certainly has the means to be a criminal mastermind; within his vast secret lair beneath his looming black house, he and the goggled Dr. Nefario (voiced by Russell Brand) have overseen the creation of ray guns that can freeze people and blow things up, vehicles that can drive on surface streets but look serious enough to drill through the Earth's crust, flying machines equipped with every missile known to man, and tiny robots disguised as chocolate chip cookies. The problem is, Gru's notoriety has been overshadowed by rival super villain Vector (voiced by Jason Siegel), who looks like Bill Gates in an orange jumpsuit and lives in an obscenely secured white fortress (surveillance cameras, hundreds of missiles, trick doors, shark-infested moats - the whole nine yards). Hoping to regain his status, Gru plots his greatest heist yet: Stealing the moon.Of course, it will have to be shrunk to a manageable size, which is why Gru needs Vector's extra special shrink ray. Here enters three orphaned girls - Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voiced by Dana Gaier), and Agnes (voiced by Elsie Fisher) - who get by selling boxes of cookies door to door; Gru adopts them, knowing that they can safely infiltrate Vector's fortress. What begins as a simple plan turns complicated when the girls start behaving like the children they are. They run around. They make noise. They touch things they're not supposed to touch. They always want to be read a story before going to bed. Aside from those things, they actually expect to be raised, a responsibility Gru has avoided after growing up with a sourpuss mother (voiced by Julie Andrews). Does he have it within himself to be a dad and a super villain?Many animated films have scenes stolen by the antics of their supporting characters. ""Despicable Me"" is no exception; here, we have Gru's minions, a multitude of yellow ball-shaped one- or two-eyed creatures of unknown origin that speak fast, high-pitched gibberish and are a bit accident prone. You look at one and just can't help but want to punt it across a football field. It would probably be able to take it, judging by the hilarious physical abuse they all endure throughout the film. They're goofy, broad, and given the best sight gags, so naturally, they thoroughly upstage all the other characters every time they appear in a scene. They're even given their own epilogue segments during the end credits, which have little to do with the actual story but deftly take advantage of the film's 3-D effects.Ah yes, the 3-D, seemingly inescapable these days. It's a process I admittedly have mixed feelings about. Sometimes is works beautifully (Disney's ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""Avatar,"" ""Alice in Wonderland""). Sometimes, it's either an unnecessary gimmick (""Clash of the Titans,"" ""My Bloody Valentine 3-D"") or a total disaster (""The Last Airbender""). I'm glad to say that it works for ""Despicable Me,"" especially during a scene at a boardwalk amusement park when Gru and the girls ride a roller coaster. There's also the moment when Gru makes an emergency landing in the middle of the street; the point of his shuttlecraft juts out from the screen, which momentarily made me think it would poke out my eye. Still, if you have the choice, go for traditional 2-D. Aside from paying less at the box office, you won't have to bother with the glasses, which can often times be a distraction.Regardless of the dimension involved, ""Despicable Me"" is a delightful film - funny, sweet, and a triumph of animation and visual effects. Kids will enjoy it for its bright colors and physical humor, and this will almost certainly include Dr. Nefario's demonstration of a gun that emits a foul-smelling gas: ""It was supposed to be a DART gun!"" Gru exclaims in frustration. Adults will like it for its subtler touches, like a sign that reads ""The Bank of Evil (formerly Lehman Brothers)."" Everyone is sure to enjoy its good-natured spirit, especially when it's coupled with scenes of Gru's minions. Mark my words: They will be remembered long after memories of the plot have faded.",4,"He's a Villain, But He's Not a Bad Guy",1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,4873,"['not', 'quite', 'wondrous',

1301879,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG97E2,C. Sawin,"[1, 1]","It's difficult to really pinpoint why it took so long to get around to Despicable Me. Animated films are kind of a guilty pleasure of mine mostly because nothing really compares to when an animated film brings together incredible animation, a talented voice cast, a solid storyline, and a strong sense of heart. There's just something about animated films that they're able to affect your entire spectrum of emotions when done right. It's something live action films aren't able to do as often, at least in modern day cinema. I think Steve Carell was the Kryptonite for Despicable Me though. Other than Anchorman and The 40 Year Old Virgin, I pretty much don't care for his work. I enjoy ""The Office"" in small doses, but Michael Scott is more annoying and overbearing than anything to me. That can pretty much go for most of Carell's work. Luckily, he seems fairly toned down in this and the odd-accented Gru is really enjoyable to watch. His repeated ""light bulb"" line in particular was a personal favorite. Truth be told, Despicable Me turned out to be a pleasant surprise.This film looks really fantastic on Blu-ray. The vibrant colors are practically brought to life in HD. A film like this must've been incredible to see in 3D in theaters. The animation is obviously the drawing factor, but the humor certainly shouldn't be overlooked. While it does get a little crude sometimes, it tends to be a bit more subtle most of the time and focuses on the silly and goofy more than anything. Gru's minions are a big selling point in the humor department. They're cute, their made up language is hilarious to listen to, and they're always getting themselves into funny situations. In fact, I'd go as far to say that the minions are probably the best part of the film.Back on the animation subject, Despicable Me is already very colorful but there's also a bit more to it than that. Seeing some of Gru's and Vector's inventions brought to animated life is a high point of the film. Vector's piranha and squid guns are rather simple on paper, but brilliant to watch in execution. The roller coaster scene is really well-animated, as well. It's probably as realistic as you can get to an actual roller coaster in an animated film. The flying chase between Vector and Gru after Gru steals the shrink ray is also a lot of fun. Watching those two try and one up each other always ends up being both entertaining and illustrates how spectacular the animation can truly get. But the character's facial expressions are where the animation shines the most; Agnes especially. The looks she gives along with her voice is enough to melt anyone's heart in an instant.Despicable Me is an overdose on adorable and overflowing with eye popping animation. Its dynamic use of lush colors and quirky characters is its surface appeal, but the film is a bit cleverer at its core. The animated adventure is worth seeing for Gru's minions alone although Agnes certainly has her moments, as well.

Of course, our baddie is not that bad, and neither are his opponents, his antagonists.  There is plenty of humor, both situational and slapstick.  Our protagonist believes using 3 young orphans can help him in his latest crime, which is only to steal the moon.  Note that this isn't something related to real life like a bank and it has no real victim, thus indicating that our protagonist isn't an evil example for our youngsters to follow.  None of the situations he places himself, or even his unintended accomplices, have much real danger.

Please don't hit me with all of the exceptions. It seems that anymore to see a movie that uplifts the customer, we have to go to the animated/CGI studios. Why is that?""Despicable Me"", partially funded by the French government(for crying out loud), brazenly stomps on these current Hollywood values. It is like a photographic negative of the gazillion dollar formula of former Disney movies, about how a kid can grow up. This is how an adult can accept responsibility and find the deepest satisfaction in loving his children(even if they are not his). The women take a bit of a hit here and come off as slightly smarmy. And the cartoon Dr. Evil resolves his inner conflict between his selfish desires and surrendering to his kids' needs.These days, when kids don't want to grow up, this is an important message, delivered in a creative, entertaining, and funny way.

I went to see it with skepticism and I was surprised of how good it was. True it has some cheap laughs but the overall humor is better than your average Dreamworks film. The minions are a a blast and the good thing is that they are not obnoxious. The animation is well done and has a talented cast that provide suitable voices for the characters. Gru is a likeable villain are as the three little girls who win his heart. But, the highlight of the film for me was Julie Andrews as Gru's cruel mother. She was a blast. The only problem was Vector, he was obnoxious and I didn't care about him throughout the film. He just drag it too much. Anyway, aside from him everything works just fine. Of course this film is not Toy Story 3 or even How To Train Your Dragon but it's pure fun.Despicable Me looks fantastic in HD, the picture is crystal clear with no artifacts.

(Vid. my only cartoon review so far, UP.) Something the wife said about DESPICABLE ME was quite striking: while seeming slightly impressed, her only comment was, ""Well, clearly they had a lot of fun making it.""She did not get the fun out of it she had been anticipating, though we did laugh at a few parts here and there. In brief, Gru (Steve Carell doing an odd impression of Swedish character actor Peter Stormare, known for playing crazy Russians), a has-been supervillain, plots against Vector (Jason Segel), the up-and-coming generation of supervillain. Using three orphan girls in his plans, Gru adopts them and they melt his stone-cold heart.The grand appeal to kids is obvious, and I guess that is all that counts: being an overgrown baby myself, I liked the little yellow ""minions"" who seem to speak a rapid-fire combination of Russian and Spanish gobbledygook. They were funny!Illumination Studios made this, and I include that only because my wife was perplexed that Pixar would make something so lacking.

It's the scene where the youngest girl steps inside an iron maiden that snaps closed on her.  Red liquid seeps out from the bottom of the door, that turns out to be red juice from her juice box, but your initial impression is that you're seeing blood.  I don't really think impailing jokes with fake blood work in a kid's film.Where this movie was the most successful was in eliciting my sympathy for the main character.  You're given a back story on him which explains why he's so driven to the point of being destructive, which gives the character some depth.

But..He's like a Harvey Pekar (American Splendor) with a freeze ray (There's a visual for you). He says and does things that we think about doing every day but can't do them in real life and even though he lies, steals, cheats, shoots people with rayguns, etc, there is no real harm done here to anyone and it's really done in a cute way.Later in the story, he ends up adopting 3 girls in order to use them to get revenge on a nemesis and ends up liking them as much as they like him. Although this part of the plot is seen coming from a mile away, the girls liking him no matter how evil he seems to be is a really cute twist. Each girl has their own style/character and they still are entertaining in their own ways.Complaints of fart jokes and a fartgun, photocopying a minion's butt, Vector doing pelvic thrusts (dancing) are very sad complaints. This is not a G movie. Know the rating system and read reviews if you are offended by such small issues. There are far greater evils in the world.Voice acting: Well done and finally more movies where a famous actor does voices that aren't their own!! Too many animations these days get high paid actors that do the lines in their own voices and that takes the fun out of it for me. Give me Mark Hamill, Steve Carrell, Mike Myers, Hank Azaria etc cuz they can do it right.I highly recommend it.

Despicable Me has enough silliness to create laughs, but is heartwarming enough with its ultimate message and moral : even the most villainous of villians can change. Sure, stealing the moon is a little bit of a silly premise, but , hey, it's a kid's movie, right? Steve Carrell is the voice of Gru,  an animated Dr. Evil type (minus the adult humor) known for stealing things. Gru, not on the top of his game, comes up with the idea of stealing the moon to maintain his status as supervillian numero uno. He needs help and sees the adoption of three girls as a means of achieving his plan. However, as you can imagine, he finds out that caring for three children is quite a chore, and, as much as his is a villain, he can't help but eventually feeling compassion for the kids. Still, a villain is a villain, and Gru has his plan to pass supernerd villain Vector, so what can possibly get in the way? Possibly three little girls?The ""change of heart"" story certainly is rehashed material, but Despicable Me is a feel-good film with some very funny moments and plenty of visual effects and entertainment, especially with Gru's ""cousins"" ,the hilarious minions, getting into all sorts of trouble.

1301997,AC4Z26E60FBEM,B002ZG97E2,Fr. Charles Erlandson,"[0, 0]","I've made a real effort to spend more time with my kids this summer. Watching the Justin Bieber movie on Father's Day and making fun of it was one way of accomplishing this goal. Watching ""Despicable Me"" with the whole family was an even better way.When my 16 year old daughter and 10 year old son suggested this as our next movie to watch together, I thought it would be about the same as most of the other animated kids movies we watch: a few funny moments, too cute for me, predictable plot line, and not much else. While the plot line was predictable, as well as the attempt to pull on the emotional heart strings, I'm still going to give this movie 5 stars.Why? Humor value. While there's not much redeeming moral value to ""Despicable Me"" (aside from the trite message of how 3 little kids melt a villain's heart), there also isn't much that's offensive.But most importantly, the movie is very, very funny. I was amazed at how many times I genuinely laughed at the movie. The villain, Gru, has the most whimsical and slightly demented vehicle and house, filled with mutant dog, many minions that remind me of Veggie Tale characters, an iron maiden, etc. etc. Time and again the way the characters and set were designed delighted me and my kids because they were so comical.The way that things go hilariously wrong for Gru and the wild set design make this movie like a feature length Bugs Bunny cartoon. One of my favorite scenes is seeing Gru with the almost non-existent forehead and skinny, skinny legs dancing at the end of the movie. Or then there's the scene where Gru tells his henchman to make a dart gun but instead the henchman creates a gun that emits a noxious gas that knocks people out. The encounters between Gru and another super-villain, Vector, are also very funny.The filmmakers worked hard to choose the best improvisational actors to do the voices, and I'm sure casting Steve Carell as Gru added a lot to the movie's humor.While some might like the touching scenes with the three girls Gru adopts, for me the value of the movie is that it made me laugh - and it did so more than most other comedies I've ever watched. Even without any other or higher purpose, any movie that's this inventive and funny gets 5 stars from me.",5,Much Funnier Than Expected!,1308700800,"06 22, 2011",2011,2249,"[""'ve"", 'made', 'real', 'effort', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'kids', 'summer', 'Watching', 'Justin', 'Bieber', 'movie', 'Father', 'Day', 'making', 'fun', 'was', 'one', 'way', 'accomplishing', 'goal', 'Watching', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'whole', 'family', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'way.When', '16', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', '10', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'suggested', 'next', 'movie', 'watch', 'together', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'most', 'other', 'animated', 'kids', 'movies', 'watch', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'too', 'cute', 'predictable', 'plot', 'line', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'predictable', 'as', 'well', 'attempt', 'pull', 'emotional', 'heart', 'strings', ""'m"", 'still', 'going', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars.Why', 'Humor', 'value', 'not', 'much', 'redeeming', 'moral', 'value', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'aside', 'trite', 'message', 'how', '3', 'little', 'kids', 'melt', 'villain', 'heart', 'also', ""n't"", 'much', 'most', 'importantly', 'movie', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'genuinely', 'laughed', 'movie', 'villain', 'Gru', 'most', 'whimsical', 'slightly', 'demented', 'vehicle', 'house', 'filled', 'mutant', 'dog', 'many', 'minions', 'remind', 'Veggie', 'Tale', 'characters', 'iron', 'maiden', 'etc', 'etc', 'Time', 'again', 'way', 'characters', 'set', 'were', 'designed', 'delighted', 'kids', 'were', 'so', 'comical.The', 'way', 'things', 'go', 'hilariously', 'wrong', 'Gru', 'wild', 'set', 'design', 'make', 'movie', 'feature', 'length', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'cartoon', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'seeing', 'Gru', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'forehead', 'skinny', 'skinny', 'legs', 'dancing', 'end', 'movie', 'then', 'scene', 'where', 'Gru', 'henchman', 'make', 'dart', 'gun', 'instead', 'henchman', 'gun', 'noxious', 'gas', 'people', 'out', 'encounters', 'Gru', 'super-villain', 'Vector', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'funny.The', 'filmmakers', 'worked', 'hard', 'choose', 'best', 'improvisational', 'actors', 'do', 'voices', ""'m"", 'sure', 'casting', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Gru', 'added', 'lot', 'movie', 'humor.While', 'might', 'like', 'touching', 'scenes', 'three', 'girls', 'Gru', 'adopts', 'value', 'movie', 'made', 'did', 'so', 'more', 'most', 'other', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'Even', 'other', 'higher', 'purpose', 'movie', 'inventive', 'funny', '5', 'stars']",N/A

Not that this battle isn't there in all its hysterical glory, but that isn't what the movie is truly about.  Up until now if you wanted computer animated movies with ""heart"", your best bet was to go with Pixar or, lately at least, DreamWorks, but with this spectacular debut Illumination Entertainment may be poised to duel with the titans of this industry.After a hilarious opening reveals the theft of the Great Pyramid, the movie focuses in on Gru (a voice acting tour de force by Steve Carrell), super villain extraordinaire, going through his normal morning evil routine, until rudely interrupted by the news that he has been topped in spectacular villainy by the upstart Vector.  When said Vector spoils Gru's plans for topping his pyramid theft by stealing from Gru the Shrink Ray he just stole in order to steal the Moon, a desperate Gru decides to acquire the only force capable of penetrating the Fortress of Vectortude:three orphan girls selling cookies door to door.What follows is the joys and agony of parenting I was talking about as Gru's coldblooded, calculated plans to manipulate and use the three little girls for selfish purposes is slowly and unwillingly transformed into something else.  Oh, it is obvious that we, the audience, are being manipulated, too, but it is done in such a spectacularly over the top fashion that we cannot truly take offense.Even without the three little girls, the sympathies of the audience could only be with Gru.  Besides the nasty little secret later revealed about him, Vector is the quintessential spoiled rich kid in contrast to Gru's working class super villain.  An unremarked but telling difference between the two is that Gru's evil at least has some sort of purpose, some sort of point to it.  Gru intends to hold the Moon for ransom; in contrast Vector appears to have no reason whatsoever for stealing the Great Pyramid, not even ""because it was there.""Note: This movie is sometimes packaged with a bonus DVD, containing three shorts: ""Home Makeover"", ""Orientation Day"", and ""Banana"", which impress by all being spectacularly good!  (I've gotten used to being disappointed by these extra straight-to-DVD computer animated shorts.)  ""Home Makeover"", the only one starring the three girls along with the scene-stealing Minions, which feels almost like a lost scene cut from the movie, chronicles the hilarious emergency childproofing of the Gru residence before inspection by a social worker.  The Minions only ""Orientation Day"", which satirizes the infamous new hire orientation film, and ""Banana"", which takes ""snack attack"" to completely insane levels, are equally great.I would LOVE to see a sequel, and more importantly I would trust these people to produce a great one.",5,"Don't Tell Your Kids, but This Is Really a Movie About the Joys and Heartaches of Parenting",1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,2845,"['Not', 'simplistic', 'hilarious', 'battle', 'couple', 'wacky', 'super', 'advertising', 'suggested', 'Not', 'battle', ""n't"", 'hysterical', 'glory', ""n't"", 'what', 'movie', 'truly', 'about', 'now', 'wanted', 'computer', 'animated', 'movies', 'heart', 'best', 'bet', 'was', 'go', 'Pixar', 'lately', 'least', 'DreamWorks', 'spectacular', 'debut', 'Illumination', 'Entertainment', 'may', 'be', 'poised', 'duel', 'titans', 'industry.After', 'hilarious', 'opening', 'theft', 'Great', 'Pyramid', 'movie', 'Gru', 'voice', 'acting', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'super', 'villain', 'extraordinaire', 'going', 'normal', 'morning', 'evil', 'routine', 'rudely', 'interrupted', 'news', 'been', 'topped', 'spectacular', 'villainy', 'upstart', 'Vector', 'When', 'said', 'Vector', 'spoils', 'Gru', 'plans', 'topping', 'pyramid', 'theft', 'stealing', 'Gru', 'Shrink', 'Ray', 'just', 'stole', 'order', 'steal', 'Moon', 'desperate', 'Gru', 'acquire', 'only', 'force', 'capable', 'penetrating', 'Fortress', 'Vectortude', 'three', 'girls', 'selling', 'cookies', 'door', 'door.What', 'joys', 'agony', 'parenting', 'was', 'talking', 'Gru', 'coldblooded', 'calculated', 'plans', 'manipulate', 'use', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'selfish', 'purposes', 'slowly', 'unwillingly', 'transformed', 'something', 'else', 'Oh', 'obvious', 'audience', 'are', 'being', 'manipulated', 'too', 'done', 'such', 'spectacularly', 'top', 'fashion', 'can', 'not', 'truly', 'take', 'offense.Even', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'sympathies', 'audience', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'Gru', 'nasty', 'little', 'secret', 'later', 'revealed', 'Vector', 'quintessential', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'kid', 'contrast', 'Gru', 'working', 'class', 'super', 'villain', 'unremarked', 'telling', 'difference', 'two', 'Gru', 'evil', 'least', 'sort', 'purpose', 'sort', 'point', 'Gru', 'hold', 'Moon', 'ransom', 'contrast', 'Vector', 'have', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'stealing', 'Great', 'Pyramid', 'not', 'even', 'was', 'there', 'Note', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'packaged', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'containing', 'three', 'shorts', 'Home', 'Makeover', 'Orientation', 'Day', 'Banana', 'impress', 'being', 'spectacularly', 'good', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'used', 'being', 'disappointed', 'extra', 'straight-to-DVD', 'computer', 'animated', 'shorts', 'Home', 'Makeover', 'only', 'one', 'starring', 'three', 'girls', 'scene-stealing', 'Minions', 'almost', 'lost', 'scene', 'cut', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'emergency', 'childproofing', 'Gru', 'residence', 'inspection', 'social', 'worker', 'Minions', 'only', 'Orientation', 'Day', 'infamous', 'new', 'hire', 'orientation', 'film', 'Banana', 'snack', 'attack', 'completely', 'insane', 'levels', 'are', 'equally', 'great.I', 'would', 'LOVE', 'see', 'sequel', 'more', 'importantly', 'would', 'trust', 'people', 'produce', 'great', 'one']",N/A

One pleasant set of extras in the show was Gru's minions: these little yellow guys are very funny and entertaining, there is always a little side-show going on with them, and they add an extra fun factor to the movie.Gru needs for his greatest ever exploit the use of a shrinking ray gun, which Vector possesses.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 2]","When someone absconds with the Pyramid of Giza and replaces it with a giant inflatable replica, it heralds the dawn of new super-villainy. The culprit, Vector, becomes the talk of the super-villain circle. Except that Gru - once the baddest super-villain around and sporting an accent somewhere between ""Bela Lugosi and Ricardo Montalban"" (to quote Steve Carrel) - isn't ready to pass the torch. The upstaged Gru hatches a plan to steal the moon, a feat juuuust a bit more showy than stealing the Pyramid of Giza. But here comes the wrench in the works. Apparently, even the most vile of villains hides a softer side. Only sometimes it takes the most drastic of measures to bring out the nice. Like, maybe, little girls knocking on the door selling cookies.Gru is one of those evil cats you find yourself instantly liking. Gru so relishes being a Big Bad, from his over-the-top heists to his petty acts against his suburban neighbors (yes, Gru dwells in the 'burbs) and the kids he passes on the street. It also helps that flashback sequences fill us in on how his icy mother time and again put him down, dashed his dreams. Gru bosses around an army of easily distracted cloned henchmen, but he seems to know each one of them by name, so that's another redeeming quality. Part of Gru's moon-theft scheme involves his adopting three little orphan girls. His deplorable parenting skills dictate that he sets out a doggy food bowl on the floor for the girls and a newspaper for them to do their business. But we all know where the wind is blowing. Gru is soon hosting play tea parties and making pinkie promises and reading bedtime stories about kittens... and enjoying it. Now Gru must make a choice. The vagaries of scheduling have set the girls' dance recital on the same date as his go time for the moon caper. What will Gru do? It doesn't matter. Vector means to derail him at any cost.The animation work for DESPICABLE ME was done in France, and there's plenty of that stylized French sensibility in the film's wonderful visual look. This movie has a lot going for it. I like the notion of a Bank of Evil (formerly Lehman Brothers) which grants loans for villains to fund their evil projects. I like the absence of a superhero, that the rivalry is instead between two super-villains. Given, Vector - who commits crimes ""with both direction and magnitude"" - will remind viewers of Syndrome from THE INCREDIBLES, but anyone who invents a gun which shoots piranhas (except that this gun is real difficult to load) and keeps a shark under his couch is okay in my book. I like the contrast of Vector's shinier, more streamlined tech versus Gru's clunkier, more old school iron vessels and weapons. That the orphan girls would be adorable and sweet is a given. But odds are good that your heart melts when our evil crankypants begins to open his heart. Gru, sinister super-villain, trying to rein in the willful little girls happens to make up my favorite moments in the film.There are even disco boogie-dancing robots.

Just hearing the one girl growl, ""He's so FLUFFY!"" about a new stuffed unicorn -- through her teeth -- proves that somebody in the animation team has litte girls.Unlike traditional film, where, if children appear, the only female presence may be a mother and the Token Girl, the girls in this film are a majority.  They have opinions, options, and disbelief -- in a good way. They're tough and reslilient.But why wouldn't they be?  They've already had to put up with a pretty bad adult in the ""normal"" world.  Taking on a self-appointed Super Villain is going to be a snap.  It's not so much girls against guys as girls against adults who seem to have lost their way.The machinery is delightfully Bullwinkle-goofy. Gru is PC, his opposite villain is Mac.  The jokes reach back to traditional animation -- Gru's ""Light Bulb"" moments are a hoot.  And Steve Carrell -- from what insanely funny Russian/Jewish?/Transylvanian ancestor is he channeling Gru's voice? (He admits he was thinking of Boris Karloff; probably the Monster Mash version). In his pep talk to his hilarious minions (he knows all their names) he does such spot-OFF imitations of rapper lines, Gru might as well be wearing a sign that says, ""How white am I?"" I went around for days afterwards, borrowing the weirdly-cadenced line, ""I hate dat guy.""Julie Andrews channels HER Cruella DeVille as Gru's mother.  I'd have given anything to see her recording the ""Eh."" sequence.The plot?  You all know that grumpy person who hates kids and doesn't want them around, and turns out to be the best bet for taking them to the lake (no, not to drown them).

The voices are perfect for the characters and surprising!  I honestly didn't recognize a lot of them (Steve Carrell's voice as Gru, Julie Andrews as his mom, Jason Segel as Vector and Kristin Wiig as Miss Hattie are some highlights that really add to the enjoyment of the movie and make the characters come alive).  One of the reasons this is great is that there are no over the top scary villains or scenes that ruin it for younger viewers but it is entertaining enough for any age.  Gru is the villian at the start of the show but they found the right mix of inept violence to make it funny and amusing (not scary).  His minions are adorable little ""might bean"" looking characters from the same genetic mutation and are really funny (the three extra movies are very short but amusing and fun to watch and focus almost exclusively on the minions).  The story is a fresh take on the fish out of water tale.  Gru wants to capture the moon to get his gusto back but needs three orphans to help him steal a shrink ray from Vector.  He intends to use them and then dump them but ends up falling in love with them (as you will) and softens through the film.

Despicable Me is the result of the experiment, and I am so relieved to say that it is a successful one.  A true labor of love, Renaud and Coffin's baby feels immediately retro in the best of ways, while still maintaining a commitment to the thematic elements that adults will appreciate.  That said, this is a goofy movie, plain and simple, and it's all the better for it.It's easy to take the concept for granted:  Two villains struggling for relevance.  Don't be so quick to write it off, for it is nothing if not purely original, even though the idea has likely been skirted around in the past.  Clearly paying homage to the now barren wasteland that was once the world of the Looney Toons, Despicable Me is, perhaps, the greatest animated film of the last five years that strictly finds its charm in stark exaggerations.  That's, admittedly, a bit of an obscure thing to wrap your head around, but it will come together while you're watching - and you do owe it to yourself to see this movie, if only to witness one of the most adorable trios of children yet seen in cinema.Renaud and Coffin put together an odd horde of diverse and talented performers for their voice cast; between Wiig, Arnett, McBride, Andrews, Segel, and two almost unrecognizable accents in both Brand and Carell, it's a funky party, to be sure.  Carell's interpretation of just who Gru is (a strictly european, self conscious man of a watered-down kind of evil) certainly finds its footing early on, making for a bit of humor simply from listening to him speak for an extended period of time.Brand continues to strengthen his track record with a decidedly awesome take on the haggard Dr. Nefario, a veteran villain past his prime and doing everything he can from keeping Gru in his own.  The kids are the real crowd pleasers, letting us all know that Pixar doesn't have a monopoly on the cute factor in animation, let alone the animation genre itself.Despicable Me is a movie that transcends any issues that may come with what could have become a gimmick in the wrong hands.  In the wake of Toy Story 3 and the terrific How to Train Your Dragon, Renaud and Coffin's film likely wont be remembered a year from now.  However, that doesn't prevent it from being a great stopgap in a pretty cramped summer.",4,Despicable Me,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2770,"['era', 'looney', 'Pixar', 'made', 'sure', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'studio', 'little', 'lamp', 'better', 'worse', 'turned', 'concept', 'cartoons', 'head', 'arrival', 'Ultimately', 'was', 'successful', 'evolution', 'not', 'share', 'unfortunate', 'sacrifices.Pierre', 'Coffin', 'Chris', 'Renaud', 'are', 'aware', 'perhaps', 'air', 'contempt', 'admittedly', 'ingenious', 'superiors', 'have', 'attempted', 'incorporate', 'best', 'worlds', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'result', 'experiment', 'am', 'so', 'relieved', 'say', 'successful', 'one', 'true', 'labor', 'love', 'Renaud', 'Coffin', 'baby', 'feels', 'immediately', 'retro', 'best', 'ways', 'still', 'maintaining', 'commitment', 'thematic', 'elements', 'adults', 'will', 'appreciate', 'said', 'goofy', 'movie', 'plain', 'simple', 'better', 'it.It', 'easy', 'take', 'concept', 'granted', 'Two', 'villains', 'struggling', 'relevance', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'quick', 'write', 'off', 'nothing', 'not', 'purely', 'original', 'even', 'idea', 'likely', 'been', 'skirted', 'past', 'Clearly', 'paying', 'homage', 'now', 'wasteland', 'was', 'once', 'world', 'Looney', 'Toons', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'animated', 'film', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'strictly', 'charm', 'stark', 'exaggerations', 'admittedly', 'bit', 'obscure', 'thing', 'wrap', 'head', 'will', 'come', 'together', ""'re"", 'watching', 'do', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', 'movie', 'only', 'witness', 'one', 'most', 'adorable', 'trios', 'children', 'yet', 'seen', 'cinema.Renaud', 'Coffin', 'put', 'together', 'odd', 'horde', 'diverse', 'talented', 'performers', 'voice', 'cast', 'Wiig', 'Arnett', 'McBride', 'Andrews', 'Segel', 'two', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'accents', 'Brand', 'Carell', 'funky', 'party', 'be', 'sure', 'Carell', 'interpretation', 'just', 'who', 'Gru', 'strictly', 'european', 'conscious', 'man', 'watered-down', 'kind', 'evil', 'certainly', 'footing', 'early', 'making', 'bit', 'humor', 'simply', 'listening', 'speak', 'extended', 'period', 'time.Brand', 'strengthen', 'track', 'record', 'decidedly', 'awesome', 'take', 'haggard', 'Dr.', 'Nefario', 'veteran', 'villain', 'prime', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'keeping', 'Gru', 'own', 'kids', 'are', 'real', 'crowd', 'pleasers', 'letting', 'know', 'Pixar', ""n't"", 'have', 'monopoly', 'cute', 'factor', 'animation', 'let', 'alone', 'animation', 'genre', 'itself.Despicable', 'Me', 'movie', 'issues', 'may', 'come', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'gimmick', 'wrong', 'hands', 'wake', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'terrific', 'How', 'Train', 'Your', 'Dragon', 'Renaud', 'Coffin', 'film', 'likely', 'wont', 'be', 'remembered', 'year', 'now', 'However', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'being', 'great', 'stopgap', 'pretty', 'cramped', 'summer']",N/A

1302157,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B002ZG97E2,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","Despicable Me was one of the surprise hits of 2010 and a film I was so charmed by I've seen it five times as of this review. WhileToy Story 3and even How to Train Your Dragon may have been the better animated films from last year, it was Despicable Me that I most thoroughly enjoyed. The film's writers take the idea that the villain is usually more fascinating than the hero and make the villain the protagonist of their story. Although, Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is hardly the villain he aspires to be.As the film opens, we learn that The Great Pyramid of Giza has been stolen and replaced with an inflatable replica. When wannabe super-villain Gru hears of this, he realizes he must do something very big and announces to his assistant Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) and his minions (more on that in a moment) that he will steal the moon. After Gru and his minions successfully steal a shrink ray it is stolen by Vector (Jason Segel), the new super-villain in town. Trying unsuccessfully to break into Vector's fortress, Gru spots three orphaned girls named Agnes, Edith, and Margo selling cookies and adopts them in order to get his shrink ray back.The creative team behind this movie deserves serious recognition for all the inventiveness that went into this movie. Gru lives in a large, evil looking house that happens to be right in the middle of a suburban setting. He has a monstrous looking ""dog"" named Kyle. Even Gru himself is a terrific creation. Physically, Gru resembles a caricature of several James Bond villains while sporting an accent that falls somewhere between Russian and Austrian. While I doubt this was Carell's inspiration, I felt the voice sounded a lot like Tommy Wiseau.The voice-work in this film is absolutely splendid. Obviously, Carell creates one of the most amusing, memorable protagonists of an animated film in sometime. Watching the film, it's hard to believe that it's Steve Carell. Also giving inspired voice-work is Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario. Obviously, there's a hint of Brand in there but he's nearly unrecognizable as well and his performance as Dr. Nefario is perfect. Julie Andrews, in an ironic twist, briefly voices Gru's nasty mother which is a treat to say the least. Segel seems to be having fun as Vector and Will Arnett turns in a great voice performance the evil Mr. Perkins. Elsie Fisher gives one of the most adorable voice performances I've ever heard as Agnes, the youngest of the three girls. You could make a valid argument that if Agnes doesn't warm your heart, you may not have a soul.It is Gru's minions that steal the show however. The minions are small, yellow creatures with their own language that serve as Gru's multi-purpose henchmen. The minions are the most adorable, hilarious creatures to emerge from an animated film in 2010. They are responsible for some of the greatest sight gags (the glowstick scene, anyone?) and some of the most hilarious moments in the film. If done right, I would watch a full-length minion movie.Creativity and originality run rampant throughout this film. The CGI animation is very colorful and vibrant, the voice cast does some great work here, the characters are adorable/memorable, there are some great throwaway lines throughout the film, and the music by Pharrell Williams is appropriately cute and catchy for the film. I have now seen this film five times and I admit it's not as great as it was the first four, but it's one of the few animated films geared directly for children that adults will enjoy just as much. Adults in particular will enjoy the ""Lehman Brothers"" gag and ""The Godfather"" reference. This movie is truly something special and is my favorite animated comedy of 2010. For an animated movie made for children this film succeeds more as a comedy than many live action films geared for adults do.GRADE: A-*As for the DVD editions, there's a single-disc edition and a slightly more expensive edition that comes with three Minion movies. The Minion movies are about 3 minutes long apiece and are amusing, but I doubt I'll ever watch them again. If you want to shell out the extra money for them, by all means do so...But that second DVD may never end up in your DVD player again.",5,My Favorite Animated Film of 2010,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,4205,"['Despicable', 'Me', 'was', 'one', 'surprise', 'hits', '2010', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'charmed', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'five', 'times', 'review', 'WhileToy', 'Story', '3and', 'even', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'animated', 'films', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'most', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'writers', 'take', 'idea', 'villain', 'usually', 'more', 'fascinating', 'hero', 'make', 'villain', 'protagonist', 'story', 'Gru', 'voiced', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'hardly', 'villain', 'be.As', 'film', 'learn', 'Great', 'Pyramid', 'Giza', 'been', 'stolen', 'replaced', 'inflatable', 'replica', 'When', 'wannabe', 'super-villain', 'Gru', 'hears', 'must', 'do', 'something', 'very', 'big', 'announces', 'assistant', 'Dr.', 'Nefario', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'minions', 'more', 'moment', 'will', 'steal', 'moon', 'Gru', 'minions', 'successfully', 'steal', 'shrink', 'ray', 'stolen', 'Vector', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'new', 'super-villain', 'town', 'Trying', 'unsuccessfully', 'break', 'Vector', 'fortress', 'Gru', 'spots', 'three', 'orphaned', 'girls', 'named', 'Agnes', 'Edith', 'Margo', 'selling', 'cookies', 'adopts', 'order', 'get', 'shrink', 'ray', 'back.The', 'creative', 'team', 'movie', 'serious', 'recognition', 'inventiveness', 'went', 'movie', 'Gru', 'large', 'evil', 'looking', 'house', 'be', 'right', 'middle', 'suburban', 'setting', 'monstrous', 'looking', 'dog', 'named', 'Kyle', 'Even', 'Gru', 'terrific', 'creation', 'Physically', 'Gru', 'caricature', 'several', 'James', 'Bond', 'villains', 'sporting', 'accent', 'somewhere', 'Russian', 'Austrian', 'doubt', 'was', 'Carell', 'inspiration', 'felt', 'voice', 'sounded', 'lot', 'Tommy', 'Wiseau.The', 'voice-work', 'film', 'absolutely', 'splendid', 'Obviously', 'Carell', 'one', 'most', 'amusing', 'memorable', 'protagonists', 'animated', 'film', 'sometime', 'Watching', 'film', 'hard', 'believe', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Also', 'giving', 'inspired', 'voice-work', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'Dr.', 'Nefario', 'Obviously', 'hint', 'Brand', 'there', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'well', 'performance', 'Dr.', 'Nefario', 'perfect', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'ironic', 'twist', 'briefly', 'voices', 'Gru', 'nasty', 'mother', 'treat', 'say', 'least', 'Segel', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'Vector', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'great', 'voice', 'performance', 'evil', 'Mr.', 'Perkins', 'Elsie', 'Fisher', 'one', 'most', 'adorable', 'voice', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Agnes', 'youngest', 'three', 'girls', 'could', 'make', 'valid', 'argument', 'Agnes', ""n't"", 'warm', 'heart', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'soul.It', 'Gru', 'minions', 'steal', 'show', 'however', 'minions', 'are', 'small', 'yellow', 'creatures', 'own', 'language', 'serve', 'Gru', 'multi-purpose', 'henchmen', 'minions', 'are', 'most', 'adorable', 'hilarious', 'creatures', 'emerge', 'animated', 'film', '2010', 'are', 'responsible', 'greatest', 'sight', 'gags', 'glowstick', 'scene', 'anyone', 'most', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'film', 'done', 'right', 'would', 'watch', 'full-length', 'minion', 'movie.Creativity', 'originality', 'run', 'rampant', 'film', 'CGI', 'animation', 'very', 'colorful', 'vibrant', 'voice', 'cast', 'great', 'work', 'here', 'characters', 'are', 'adorable/memorable', 'are', 'great', 'throwaway', 'lines', 'film', 'music', 'Pharrell', 'Williams', 'appropriately', 'cute', 'catchy', 'film', 'have', 'now', 'seen', 'film', 'five', 'times', 'admit', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'was', 'first', 'four', 'one', 'few', 'animated', 'films', 'geared', 'directly', 'children', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Adults', 'particular', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Lehman', 'Brothers', 'gag', 'Godfather', 'reference', 'movie', 'truly', 'something', 'special', 'favorite', 'animated', 'comedy', '2010', 'animated', 'movie', 'made', 'children', 'film', 'more', 'comedy', 'many', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'geared', 'adults', 'do.GRADE', 'A-*As', 'DVD', 'editions', 'single-disc', 'edition', 'slightly', 'more', 'expensive', 'edition', 'three', 'Minion', 'movies', 'Minion', 'movies', 'are', '3', 'minutes', 'long', 'apiece', 'are', 'amusing', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'watch', 'again', 'want', 'shell', 'out', 'extra', 'money', 'means', 'do', 'so', 'second', 'DVD', 'may', 'never', 'end', 'up', 'DVD', 'player', 'again']",N/A

1302249,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B002ZG97E2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[31, 41]","I had seen the various teaser trailers for ""Despicable Me"" and it looked okay, but it was not until I saw the trailer that suddenly introduced three little girls into the mix that I was actually interested in going to catch this in the theater instead of waiting for the DVD.  The little yellow minions were certainly cute enough, but it was the whole idea of how the character of Gru, a nefarious villain who is plotting to steal the money, ends up having to take care of those three little girls that got me interested.  After all, these are computer animated little girls, which means they have those great big eyes.  Well, in turns out, that Gru has hatched up his evil plan to steal the moon because the villain down the street, Vector, has been stealing Gru's thunder (well, actually, Vector stole a pretty big landmark).  The three little girls, who live in a local for-profit orphanage, have been going door to door selling cookies.  Gru turned them away, but Vector loves cookies, which gives Gru an idea that involves the girls and cookie-robots for this wacky new moon race.One of the things I found impressive about this movie is that Gru's voice never really sounded like Steve Carell, and the same can be said for Julie Andrews as his mom or Kristen Wiig as Miss Hattie.  An animated film where the voices do not conjure up the actual actors and actresses is rather refreshing.  But the voices are really secondary to the main strength of the movie, which is that it is pretty much non-stop comic cuteness.  I loved the fact that each of the minions has his own name, even if I could not remember the names or really tell any of the minions apart, and it was nice to see that the two-eyed and one-eyed minions all got along with each other in complete and utter minion harmony.  This is one of those madcap movies that throws little jokes and gags in at pretty much any opportunity.  Meanwhile, the closer Gru gets to his goal of stealing the moon, the more it becomes obvious to us that the bad guy is having his heart stolen.  I had my expectations of how it would play out, and all of my guesses turned out to be wrong, and most of what directors Chris Renaud (the Oscar nominated short ""No Time For Nuts"") and Pierre Coffin (the U.K animated short ""Gary's Fall"") came up with was better.  I laughed and I cried, which is pretty much as good as it gets at the movies.This was my first movie in digital 3D and to my surprise I survived the experience without having my head blow up like it does when I see totally hand-held camera movies like ""Cloverfield.""  The only downside was going out in the bright sunlight after wearing ""dark"" glasses for a couple of hours.  On the one hand I have nothing specific to which I can compare my digital 3D experience, but it was nice to actual enjoy thinking that objects were about to hit my nose as opposed to seeing a 3D move in 2D like ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" and being annoyed anytime a patently obvious 3D gimmick pops up on screen.  I guess I find the visual tricks a lot more fun in an animated film than in a horror flick.  I might be willing to try a non-animated digital 3D movie next, although those all seem to be CGI dominated films, but I guess that is to be expected.  Apparently they can turn anything into digital 3D, but I am not sure if I am ready for the technology to be applied to ""Gone with Wind,"" ""Casablanca,"" and ""Citizen Kane,"" although it cannot possibly be as bad as colorization.  Anyhow, I liked the 3D experience way more than I had anticipated and for the rest of you that went gaga over ""Avatar"" or ""Toy Story 3"" in 3D, all I can say is that my sense of wonder this time around probably made me bump the rating up higher than I might have if I had seen the movie in 2D, but it was definitely a key part of my wonderful experience today.",5,"I laughed, I cried, and I enjoyed my first digital 3D movie",1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,3826,"['had', 'seen', 'various', 'teaser', 'trailers', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'looked', 'okay', 'was', 'not', 'saw', 'trailer', 'suddenly', 'introduced', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'mix', 'was', 'actually', 'interested', 'going', 'catch', 'theater', 'instead', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'little', 'yellow', 'minions', 'were', 'certainly', 'cute', 'enough', 'was', 'whole', 'idea', 'how', 'character', 'Gru', 'nefarious', 'villain', 'who', 'plotting', 'steal', 'money', 'up', 'having', 'take', 'care', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'got', 'interested', 'are', 'computer', 'animated', 'little', 'girls', 'have', 'great', 'big', 'eyes', 'Well', 'turns', 'out', 'Gru', 'hatched', 'up', 'evil', 'plan', 'steal', 'moon', 'villain', 'street', 'Vector', 'been', 'stealing', 'Gru', 'thunder', 'well', 'actually', 'Vector', 'stole', 'pretty', 'big', 'landmark', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'live', 'local', 'for-profit', 'orphanage', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'door', 'door', 'selling', 'cookies', 'Gru', 'turned', 'away', 'Vector', 'cookies', 'Gru', 'idea', 'girls', 'cookie-robots', 'wacky', 'new', 'moon', 'race.One', 'things', 'found', 'impressive', 'movie', 'Gru', 'voice', 'never', 'really', 'sounded', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'mom', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Miss', 'Hattie', 'animated', 'film', 'where', 'voices', 'do', 'not', 'conjure', 'up', 'actual', 'actors', 'actresses', 'rather', 'refreshing', 'voices', 'are', 'really', 'secondary', 'main', 'strength', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'non-stop', 'comic', 'cuteness', 'loved', 'fact', 'minions', 'own', 'name', 'even', 'could', 'not', 'remember', 'names', 'really', 'tell', 'minions', 'apart', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'two-eyed', 'one-eyed', 'minions', 'got', 'along', 'other', 'complete', 'utter', 'minion', 'harmony', 'one', 'madcap', 'movies', 'little', 'jokes', 'gags', 'pretty', 'much', 'opportunity', 'Meanwhile', 'closer', 'Gru', 'goal', 'stealing', 'moon', 'more', 'obvious', 'bad', 'guy', 'having', 'heart', 'stolen', 'had', 'expectations', 'how', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'guesses', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'wrong', 'most', 'what', 'directors', 'Chris', 'Renaud', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'short', 'Time', 'Nuts', 'Pierre', 'Coffin', 'U.K', 'animated', 'short', 'Gary', 'Fall', 'came', 'up', 'was', 'better', 'laughed', 'cried', 'pretty', 'much', 'as', 'good', 'movies.This', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'digital', '3D', 'surprise', 'survived', 'experience', 'having', 'head', 'blow', 'up', 'when', 'see', 'totally', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'movies', 'Cloverfield', 'only', 'downside', 'was', 'going', 'out', 'bright', 'sunlight', 'wearing', 'dark', 'glasses', 'couple', 'hours', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'nothing', 'specific', 'can', 'compare', 'digital', '3D', 'experience', 'was', 'nice', 'actual', 'enjoy', 'thinking', 'objects', 'were', 'hit', 'nose', 'opposed', 'seeing', '3D', 'move', '2D', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', '3D', 'being', 'annoyed', 'patently', 'obvious', '3D', 'gimmick', 'up', 'screen', 'guess', 'find', 'visual', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'animated', 'film', 'horror', 'flick', 'might', 'be', 'willing', 'try', 'non-animated', 'digital', '3D', 'movie', 'next', 'seem', 'be', 'CGI', 'dominated', 'films', 'guess', 'be', 'expected', 'Apparently', 'can', 'turn', 'anything', 'digital', '3D', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'am', 'ready', 'technology', 'be', 'applied', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Casablanca', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'colorization', 'Anyhow', 'liked', '3D', 'experience', 'way', 'more', 'had', 'anticipated', 'rest', 'went', 'gaga', 'Avatar', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', '3D', 'can', 'say', 'sense', 'wonder', 'time', 'around', 'probably', 'made', 'bump', 'rating', 'up', 'higher', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', '2D', 'was', 'definitely', 'key', 'part', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'today']",N/A

(There are some sly references to the recent banking fallout.) Gru and Vector are both very intelligent and inventive and they come up with some beyond James Bond gadgets. Gru develops a plan to seize the amazing shrink-ray gun that will enable him to steal the unimaginable-the moon. Yes, the moon!

It is so good, that I hardly know where to begin - so I tried to put the whole review in four points, mentioned in the title:1. Hilarity - IT IS HILARIOUS! REALLY! There is hardly any 15 seconds in this movie that would not contain a really good gag, children or/and adult oriented. Whoever wrote the scenario was a genius!2. Despicability - the main character, Gru, is really a delight to watch: ugly, grumpy, mean, petty, vengeful, scheming, permanently aggravated and wholeheartedly devoted to the cause of evil - and in the same time incredibly insecure, convinced deep in his heart that he is a looser and haunted by the every day stronger feeling of the impending doom, for him and his evil army. I believe also that even his name is a kind of evil double entendre: it is obviously an abbreviation of ""gruesome"" but GRU was also, during the Cold War, the name of Soviet Army military intelligence, in charge particularly of assassinations abroad. In some James Bond movies GRU appeared under the name of Smertch. It gives a particular flavor to Gru, considering that his character is clearly inspired by some of the supervillains from James Bond franchise. His geriatric sidekick (and only friend - well, kind of) doctor Nefario and his murderous dog/rat/wolverine/skunk like pet (even after two viewings of this movie the jury is still out in my house on the question ""what is this animal?"") give also a great show!3. Girl power - any parent of little girls (I have two) will fall immediately in love with Margo, Edith and Agnes, the three little orphaned sisters Gru adopts in the movie. He adopts them for his own evil reasons and does intend to treat them harshly and get rid of them as soon as they are no more needed - but of course ends by being completely taken under the sweet and soft but in the same time surprisingly totalitarian control little girls exercise over their fathers, adoptive or not...))) Agnes, the youngest of the three (she is barely out of the diapers) is particularly sweet - if only she was real I would adopt her on the spot and spoil her silly all the rest of my life. Tomboyish Edith (she is in principle the one who is the boldest - but she was already hurt enough in her life to hide behind her pink hat which she refuses to take off even to sleep) and precociously adult (at least on surface of things) Margo are also a delight to watch. If you already are a parent of a little girl, you WILL LOVE this movie. And if you do not have yet a young daughter, get one!4. But as far as the reasons to watch this movie go, even the girls must cede the first place to the minions! The incredibly devoted, fearless and highly professional and in the same time impossibly immature and conflicted ""evil"" army of Gru minions is THE greatest treasure of this movie. By looking at the cover of the DVD you can see some of them and frankly whoever conceived Gru minions was a world level genius. I do not want to provide spoilers, but believe me - they pack incredible fun! There is also at least one scene when their childlike devotion to their master almost made me cry - before another outburst of laughter (including a lot of giggling) in the cinema took over...I purposefully omitted in this review many characters and did not hint at most of the gags and scenes, to avoid spoilers and keep things short.To conclude, this is a TREASURE OF A MOVIE. A thing to buy, watch, keep and re-watch on regular basis. And I ABSOLUTELY HOPE FOR A SEQUEL!",5,"A perfect mix of hilarity, despicability, girl power and minions",1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,3538,"['loved', 'movie', '10', 'y.o', 'daughter', 'loved', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'good', 'hardly', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'tried', 'put', 'whole', 'review', 'four', 'points', 'mentioned', 'title:1', 'Hilarity', 'IT', 'HILARIOUS', 'REALLY', 'hardly', '15', 'seconds', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'contain', 'really', 'good', 'gag', 'children', 'or/and', 'adult', 'oriented', 'wrote', 'scenario', 'was', 'genius', '2', 'Despicability', 'main', 'character', 'Gru', 'really', 'delight', 'watch', 'ugly', 'grumpy', 'mean', 'petty', 'vengeful', 'scheming', 'permanently', 'aggravated', 'wholeheartedly', 'devoted', 'cause', 'evil', 'same', 'time', 'incredibly', 'insecure', 'convinced', 'deep', 'heart', 'looser', 'haunted', 'day', 'stronger', 'feeling', 'impending', 'doom', 'evil', 'army', 'believe', 'also', 'even', 'name', 'kind', 'evil', 'double', 'entendre', 'obviously', 'abbreviation', 'gruesome', 'GRU', 'was', 'also', 'Cold', 'War', 'name', 'Soviet', 'Army', 'military', 'intelligence', 'charge', 'particularly', 'assassinations', 'abroad', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'GRU', 'appeared', 'name', 'Smertch', 'particular', 'flavor', 'Gru', 'considering', 'character', 'clearly', 'inspired', 'supervillains', 'James', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'geriatric', 'sidekick', 'only', 'friend', 'well', 'kind', 'doctor', 'Nefario', 'murderous', 'dog/rat/wolverine/skunk', 'pet', 'even', 'two', 'viewings', 'movie', 'jury', 'still', 'out', 'house', 'question', 'what', 'animal', 'give', 'also', 'great', 'show', '3', 'Girl', 'power', 'parent', 'little', 'girls', 'have', 'two', 'will', 'fall', 'immediately', 'love', 'Margo', 'Edith', 'Agnes', 'three', 'little', 'orphaned', 'sisters', 'Gru', 'adopts', 'movie', 'own', 'evil', 'reasons', 'intend', 'treat', 'harshly', 'get', 'rid', 'as', 'soon', 'are', 'more', 'needed', 'course', 'ends', 'being', 'completely', 'taken', 'sweet', 'soft', 'same', 'time', 'surprisingly', 'totalitarian', 'control', 'little', 'girls', 'exercise', 'fathers', 'adoptive', 'not', 'Agnes', 'youngest', 'three', 'barely', 'diapers', 'particularly', 'sweet', 'only', 'was', 'real', 'would', 'adopt', 'spot', 'spoil', 'silly', 'rest', 'life', 'Tomboyish', 'Edith', 'principle', 'one', 'who', 'boldest', 'was', 'already', 'hurt', 'enough', 'life', 'hide', 'pink', 'hat', 'take', 'off', 'even', 'sleep', 'precociously', 'adult', 'least', 'surface', 'things', 'Margo', 'are', 'also', 'delight', 'watch', 'already', 'are', 'parent', 'little', 'girl', 'WILL', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'yet', 'young', 'daughter', 'get', 'one', '4', 'as', 'far', 'reasons', 'watch', 'movie', 'go', 'even', 'girls', 'must', 'cede', 'first', 'place', 'minions', 'incredibly', 'devoted', 'fearless', 'highly', 'professional', 'same', 'time', 'impossibly', 'immature', 'conflicted', 'evil', 'army', 'Gru', 'minions', 'greatest', 'treasure', 'movie', 'looking', 'cover', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'frankly', 'whoever', 'conceived', 'Gru', 'minions', 'was', 'world', 'level', 'genius', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'provide', 'spoilers', 'believe', 'pack', 'incredible', 'fun', 'also', 'least', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'childlike', 'devotion', 'master', 'almost', 'made', 'cry', 'outburst', 'laughter', 'including', 'lot', 'giggling', 'cinema', 'took', 'purposefully', 'omitted', 'review', 'many', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'hint', 'most', 'gags', 'scenes', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'keep', 'things', 'short.To', 'conclude', 'TREASURE', 'A', 'MOVIE', 'thing', 'buy', 'watch', 'keep', 're-watch', 'regular', 'basis', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'HOPE', 'A', 'SEQUEL']",N/A

1302324,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B002ZG97E2,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Despicable Me is a very entertaining animated feature film that captures your attention even if you're an adult and pretty much know where the plot is going. Young children will clamor to see this film over and over again; one of its strengths is that the humor can be appreciated by both children and adults. The plot moves along at a very good pace and the quality of the animation is outstanding. The voice-overs impressed me; the casting for the character voices is just perfect and that's grand. In addition, the musical score enhances the film.When the action starts (and there's plenty of action at that), we quickly meet evil Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) whose mother (voiced by the great Julie Andrews) wasn't exactly nurturing when he was growing up. Gru delights in stealing things to maintain his reputation as the world's most evil villain; but Gru is upstaged when another, younger villain named Vector (voiced by Jason Segel) has a shrink ray machine--something Gru needs badly for his master plan to steal the moon from the sky and make the world pay for it. However, there's quite a bit of competition between Gru and Vector for the shrink ray machine--and that's where three young adorable, innocent girls come in. Agnes (voiced by Elsie Fisher), Edith (voiced by Dana Gaier) and Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove) are all living in a run-down orphanage for girls run by the malevolent Miss Hattie (voiced by Kristen Wiig); they are ordered by Miss Hattie to sell cookies by the dozens to avoid being stuck in a public ""box of shame"" and the girls desperately want to be adopted by a great mom and dad.The plot really heats up when Gru has an ""aha"" moment (he says ""light bulb""). Gru and his tiny little helped called the ""minions"" make up a false background for him so that he can adopt the three girls from the orphanage. Gru tells Miss Hattie he wants the girls to add light to his life as a highly respected and award winning dentist; but in actuality Gru wants the girls merely to sell ""robot cookies"" to Vector--robot cookies that will steal the shrink ray machine and get Gru the ability to steal the moon and realize his evil dream that he and his sidekick/mentor Dr Nefario (voiced by Russell Brand) have yearned to do for years.The rest of the plot may be obvious to some readers, but of course I'm stopping here to avoid any spoilers--and there will be some at that!

Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 3]","""Despicable Me"" draws inevitable comparisons to ""Megamind"": Two animated films about supervillains-turned-heroes came out in 2010. I loved ""Megamind"" so I was curious to see how ""Despicable Me"" would stack up. It's a close race.""Despicable Me""'s main protagonist is Gru (Steve Carell, almost unrecognizable with his faux-Slavic accent), a washed-up supervillain who lives in a pleasant suburban neighborhood. When rival supervillain and Bill Gates-lookalike Vector (Jason Segel) steals the Great Pyramid of Gaza, Gru's professional reputation is at stake.  Goaded on by his Twinkie-like minions and ancient mad scientist Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), Gru decides to kidnap the moon.Gru is not a nice person.  He kidnaps (and possibly kills) dogs, he mocks children, and he thinks nothing of adopting three adorable moppets and manipulating them into stealing a shrink ray from Vector. Said moppets consist of sensible and eldest Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), toughie Edith (Dana Gaier), and adorable Agnes (Elsie Fisher). The three girls are not particularly fleshed out - Edith is practically silent - but you get the impression that it takes three adorable kids to make us forget that Gru's kind of a jerk.What's more surprising is how ""Despicable Me"" points the finger at the disparity between old and new villainy.  Gru is quaint in his anachronistic ways, from his house to his super-weapons, and he takes on the role of a benevolent boss to his adoring minions.  His biggest flaw appears to be his European heritage, a bygone relic of global politics that no longer apply.  Gru's form of evil has been unseated by corporations, by technology, and most of all by banks.  The Bank of Evil, to be precise, who is only willing to fund nefarious plans led by younger villains - and if there happens to be a bit of nepotism involved, so much the better.Of course, we know that Gru will come to love the three little tikes, that he will rise to the occasion to defend them, and that he will have to make a choice between his supervillain ambitions and his new role as a guardian.Unlike ""Megamind,"" which contrasted Gen X and Gen Y superhero archetypes, ""Despicable Me,"" is much more interested in entertaining the kiddies. The minions are pure audience fodder, there to act as slapstick asides when the action lags.  Other than his fondness for aquatic animal-based weaponry and his Microsoft-stylized lair, Vector has no character development.

Many movies for kids throw in adult situations, double entendres, crass dialog and rude humor, thinking that's how to draw in the adults.Despicable Meis appealing to adults because the story's scenes are familiar -- they're situations that we live every day. Rocky relationships with neighbors, frustrations with aging parents, younger workers taking our jobs, family obligations conflicting with job responsibilities. We know what Gru is going through!Yet this appeal for adults does nothing to make the movie less enjoyable for kids. My son says it's his favorite movie of all time. He knew the DVD release date and made sure we reserved one at the bookstore. The dialog is clever and the characters delightfully drawn.

Shrek began something different; a movie about a supposed bad guy, Shrek, who turns out to be good at heart.  This began a gradual diversification of animated films to the point that in 2010, most of the highest-grossing cartoons did not have a uniformly evil antagonist.  Toy Story 3 explored the roots of Lotso's rage.  In Megamind, the villian turns into the hero.  And so in Despicable Me, we have a movie solely about bad guys competing to be who is the baddest of them all.  Voiced by well known comedians, this family friendly movie has a fairly large cast of characters of various shapes and sizes.  All get in their funny parts, some of which is dialog, and some of which is slapstick.  The overall movie pace is good, with both fast action scenes and slow scenes of character development.  Like any good movie, there is a lot of unpredictability.  The only thing missing was a good soundtrack.

1302432,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B002ZG97E2,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[2, 12]","I'm definitely over this ridiculous fad for 3D. I'm also over the Pixar-induced infatuation Hollywood seems to have with animated 'kidult"" movies: predictably enough, even as the digital wizardry has continually popped eyes, story lines have proved ever more derivative, and great films, digital, 3D, or otherwise remain as elusive as ever. Most the recent digital cartoons including (universally feted but, in my contrarian opinion, overrated) Toy story 3 have been duds. So I had no great expectations of Despicable Me, particularly as its tag line (""super bad. Super dad"") promised a dreary couple of hours.The first thing you notice about the film - or perhaps the last, seeing as it is only with the rolling of the credits that you realise what has caused this odd dissonance - is how French it is. Other than the voice actors, virtually every name on the credit roll is French.And that gives it, well, a je ne sais quoi (he says with a ""pfft"" and a Gallic shrug). Gru, the master villain, wears the sort of stylish scarf and a snappy zip-up turtle-neck that would simply never occur to a Californian. His house is a decaying Gothic mansion with a dead lawn, but live suburban Californian neighbours (no South Pacific atolls for this major criminal, but his inside space is still cavernous to say the least). Gru drives an ungainly rocket-powered car made of riveted steel that might be ofJules Verne'sdevising. And Gru - sardonic, ironic, eastern European Gru - is the hero of the film, not the villain: in tune with the modern world's acknowledgement that there is no good and bad, only 1001 different flavours of turpitude, Gru's quest is nothing more honourable than reclaiming the world's number 1 bad guy spot off some precocious young kid in a tracksuit.So a word about allegories.  I have seen a couple bandied about in cyber space, that this is a thinly disguised biopic about Microsoft and Apple - for said track suited adolescent ""Vector"", superimpose Bill Gates. And Vector certainly seems to have outdone the older, more complacent Gru, in every conceivable way (whilst being obsessed with a Squid Gun!). Yet, with Microsoft these days more or less an also-ran in the tech wars, it's difficult to see why this would be an interesting subject to explore. And it might jut as well be about Google versus Microsoft, or even Universal versus Pixar. But you do have a hunch that the Frenchmen are hinting at something darker than the nostalgic slapstick of, say,The Incredibles. There is something about this film's bearing that leads you (well, it led me, at any rate) to look for buried messages.As is the way of these post-modern comedies, the cultural references are legion, and the story itself is an imaginative (or perhaps random) welding together ofLittle Orphan Annie,Moonraker, the Incredibles and, in its way,Wall Street: Gru's problems only start when he is turned down by his bankers for a loan to finance his latest dastardly enterprise. His bank: The Bank of Evil, of course. (Subtitled: ""Formerly Lehman Brothers"").What looked like a cheap shot had me thinking allegorically again (sorry: it's a weakness). I wonder whether it isn't technology, but capitalism itself, that is the Frenchmen's target. Something chimes about the parallels between the corporate and banking excesses of recent years which, as we remorsefully rehearse, sorely lacked social utility outside the enrichment of their perpetrators - and a hubristic and egotistical race to do something as pointless (and self-harming, as a poor werewolf discovers, mid-howl) as stealing the moon. The only motivation offered was ""profit"", with no explanation given for how any might accrue (which also rings rather true!)Certainly, the speech Gru gives to all his ""minions"" (semi-sentient little helpers who look like Advil capsules in goggles and denim overalls:  he tells them to prepare their CVs) resembles Dick Fuld's supposed speech to his defeated troops after the battle of wall street in 2008, and the minions (half-witted automatons) do rather resemble aspiring investment bankers. The Lehman reference, perhaps, was not coincidental.So much for hubris: Gru's redemption is at the hands of three orphans whom he adopts for nefarious purposes, and in whose hands he makes his moral recovery. This is predictable, yes, and formulaic, yes, but nevertheless is handled deftly, with genuine inventiveness and the same sort of new parent's knowingness which infuses Pixar's output: Gru's irritation at the feebleness of the bedtime story he is required to read was visceral and very, very familiar to the audience, judging by their uproarious response. Brilliant.The 3D is used inventively (why no-one has ever thought to stage a rollercoaster ride in a 3D movie before is beyond me, but it works a treat) without ever being gratuitous. And I liked the incidental music too: other than the opening strains of Lynrd Skynrd (accompanying a stereotypically annoying family of American tourists: again, a deft little Gallic tweak) it is suave and, well, Continental.Others have carped that Despicable Me is saccharine: maybe it caught me on a good day but I didn't think so at all: I enjoyed every minute, and so did my kids (9 through 4), so from me it comes well recommended for all ages.Olly Buxton",5,Despicable Who?,1285113600,"09 22, 2010",2010,5288,"[""'m"", 'definitely', 'ridiculous', 'fad', '3D', ""'m"", 'also',

1302435,AHF97M45JFCB,B002ZG97E2,ONENEO,"[2, 2]","You sort of have to pull for Despicable Me regardless of whether or not you actually enjoyed the film.  Why? Well because Illumination Entertainment, the company responsible for this work, did the impossible by knocking one out of the park their first time at bat.  Founded in 2007, it's downright impressive they even managed to put out a feature length CGI film by 2010 of any quality! The feat becomes even more impressive once the quality of this one is revealed.Additionally the film has managed to establish itself so firmly in the world's collective psyche that not only is a sequel in the works for 2013 but also a spin-off film based on the minions for the following year.  Not bad at all for a firm with only three titles to its entire roster at present (the other two being a CG/ live action hybrid called Hop and a second full CG feature, Dr. Seuss' The Lorax).But enough about Illumination and their meteoric rise to legitimate competition to industry heavy hitters Pixar, DreamWorks, Sony Imageworks and Blue Sky, you are surely reading this review to learn more about the movie itself.  But before we get to that, consider Despicable Me's modest budget of $69-mil.  If that sounds like a lot to you, the average budget of a modern CG feature from the likes of some of the companies mentioned above is roughly $150-million with some even dwarfing that amount (fellow 2010 CG entry Toy Story 3 cost a staggering $200-million for example).  Obviously this makes Despicable Me's current gross of $543,113,985 even more impressive!  Okay now I'm done talking about Illumination, honest.Despicable Me tells the tale of a villain getting up there in years who is feeling the squeeze put on by young up and coming evil-doers like the smug & tech-crazy Vector.  So as to one up Vector and raise the bar of villainy so high that no other baddie can ever compete, antagonist/ protagonist Gru hatches a scheme straight off the pages of a comic book: He'll steal the moon!But to accomplish such a lofty ambition a little heist action is in order: Namely the stealing back of the shrink ray that Vector stole from Gru after he had stolen it initially.  Confused yet? No need to strain your noodle, the plot is a straight forward through and through with a wide variety of visual goodies and far reaching shades of humor to be sure to get almost anyone giggling sooner or later.Things get complicated for our pointy nosed, bald headed, sweater donning bad guy when his scheming requires that he adopt a trio of wide-eyed orphans.  Lending his voice to the character of Gru is none other than The Office's Steve Carell with a surprisingly convincing European accent.  The remainder of the cast is equally well selected and delivers above average vocal deliveries to compliment the solid visuals- Jason Segal as Vector, Julie Andrews as Gru's unlovable and unloving mom, and strangely appropriate Russell Brand as Gru's geriatric genius inventor Dr. Nefario.However, and as you might expect, an animated version of Austin Powers' Dr. Evil is hardly going to obtain the type of marketability that you'd expect from a film trying to give Disney a run for its money but don't worry, Despicable Me has that covered in earnest as well in the form of the minions.  While it's never actually made clear just what these little yellow capsules with safety goggles and overalls actually are in the film, the special features reveals that they are in fact small genetically engineered drones.  The high-pitched nearly unintelligible banter is just the icing on the cute/ marketable cake.  If additional films and theme park rides are any indication, mission accomplished.The soundtrack & score are spectacular as well.  Pharrell Williams provides an absolutely infectious blend of beat driven filler instrumentals and original hip-hop and R&B; numbers.Comparisons to DreamWorks' Megamind are all but inevitable and though pretty similar from afar, the fact is Megamind is more of a spoof on comic-book clich&eacute;/ superhero vs super-villainy not unlike Pixar's The Incredibles  (just told from the bad guy's point of view).  Despicable Me is more about the business of trying to make it in the world as a villain; completely doing away with the hero element altogether.  At the risk of providing a little spoiler, this is a redemption tale at its core as well: The type where the goodness present in the human heart trumps even the sheer terror of wearing a gray turtleneck sweater with scarf and freezing everyone ahead of him into a block of ice in the line at the coffee shop.In all, Despicable Me falls into the territory of a resounding success in just about every unit of measurement.  The plot feels a tad bit more forced than the well-oiled machine that is Pixar (or DreamWorks of late) but for a new studio on an extremely limited budget, such complaints become increasingly insignificant.  With an exclusive partnership with Universal Films, Illumination Entertainment has made it clear that they aren't going to be content competing with anything less than the absolute upper echelon of the genre.  This, their first entry into the fold is 95-minutes well spent.  Here's hoping we're treated to that inexplicably absent back-story of the minions in either of the forthcoming films in the series.",4,Impressive Debut Film in a Fiercely Competitive

This sort of storyline, obviously, depends on more than just the story to make it enjoyable, or not.Despicable Me succeeded in including the right ""more"", and the movie was very fun. Gru, the main character villain, is a villain who pops kids' balloons, has an Iron Maiden in his living room, and has a savage ""dog"" who attacks him; for all of this, he's not really a bad guy -- at least, by the end of the movie.When a cookie-selling trio of orphans turns out to be his only hope at attaining the weapon he needs to shrink the moon, Gru becomes a father. His obvious cluelessness at parenting, we can guess, is a result of his mother's interactions with him as a child, which were hardly motherly. However, Gru, the trio of orphans, and the bizarre yellow creatures Gru has living in his basement, end up coming to understand one another, and life (as we all knew they would). But, they do this in a highly entertaining way, that is a lot of fun to watch.

What's he going to do? Why, ""steal"" the moon of course. The only way he can pull off his plan is if he manipulates three orphaned little girls, hopefully whom he does not get too attached to. That would throw his ideals into jeopardy, he might actually want to truly adopt them. Well, he'd never make that mistake, would he? Well, yeah, of course he would...A lot of people have complained about Gru, Vector, and Gru's head scientist Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), they say they're too over the top. But that's the whole point. Steve Carrel's fake Russian accent (""The physical appearance of the please makes no difference!""), Vector's giddiness (""OH YEAH!""), and the mad-scientist personality of Nefario (""I call it 'The Nefario Principle!'"") are the whole points of the characters. They play off of clich&eacute;s and tropes. That's what makes it work. Really, I thought these characters were pretty funny, and kudos to the actors for making their voices so ridiculous. People also complained about the Minions because they thought all they did was punch each other. I can see where you're coming from, but I think there was more to it. I mean, you've gotta enjoy how they basically love Gru like he's a dictator, and they adore their line of work so much. You could call the gibberish speak gimmicky, but it's actually a lot like a constructed language, you can hear them repeating the same ""words"" and ""phrases"" in the right context. As for the punching, I dunno, mutated popcorn kernels punching each other worked for me. C'mon, there was more to it, the punches were just the icing on the cake. Speaking of icing on the cake, I was very fond of the musical score.There are a bunch of funny little pop-culture/shout-out moments that younger viewers won't notice, but the presence of these things is much appreciated. By now, the whole ""Bank of Evil"" thing is infamous. Some of the other humor was really memorable (""Wow! This is garbage. You actually like this?""), other bits were nothing that blew me away. Younger viewers will be more entertained by the movie, that's for sure. However, I didn't find Despicable Me boring or anything.Despicable Me captures an enjoyable atmosphere, not just with its score, but also with its world. There don't seem to be any superheroes, although there sure are supervillains. There's an entire secret society of them; a business to being evil. It's really clever, what with the aforementioned Bank of Evil and bad guys actually getting loans for evil projects.The emotional core of the movie is of course Gru's inevitable softening at the hands of the three girls. Because of that, there are a lot of jokes that you've seen before, and moments that really aren't all that funny. Also, the plot starts getting more and more predictable towards the end. Thankfully, the emotional toll Gru's newfound fatherhood took on his relationship with Nefario was very believable and involving.Some parts of Despicable Me are unforgettable, and you've seen other parts many times before. The movie's world is amazing, it's got some stand-out jokes and shout-outs, Gru and Nefario's relationship is emotionally involving, the characters are funny, the soundtrack is cool.

He has stolen many things in a lifetime alone, from the Times Square Jumbotron to the Paris Eiffel Tower. He runs an army of cute yellow minions, and he plans to steal the moon, his greatest crime. However though, a copycat named Vector, who is smarter than him too, has stolen the pyramid of Giza and replaced it with an inflatable one.

1302502,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B002ZG97E2,RJ Smoove,"[1, 1]","In my opinion, Despicable Me is yet another heartfelt, hilarious animated comedy for us to sink our teeth into this year. I thought to myself at the end of the movie that it felt a lot like the live-action version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. So I dubbed it, ""How The Gru Stole The Moon"". Anyway, this is a fantastic film, but the cuteness can be a bit much from time to time. I don't think they needed the added ""aww"" moments. It's obviously marketed for very young children, but like so many other animated films, there's plenty of material here to keep the adults happy. In the theatre, I laughed out loud in the more at this one, than I have at an animated film in a very long time. After rewatching it at home, it hasn't lost its spark. The voicework is just under terrific. I love Steve Carrell (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, The Office), but at times his fake accent can be a little overdone (especially with all of the sayings). I love Jason Segal (I Love You Man, Forgetting Sarah Marshall) just as much, and his work is actually perfect. His voice fit Vector to perfection. Once more, I love Russell Brand (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him To The Greek) and Kristen Wiig Adventureland, MacGruber), so their voices were a welcome treat. And last, but not least, the minions. Their voices were done by the two directors. As you can see, I had high expectations for this ensemble of hilarious comedians going in. They didn't disappoint.Like I said, Steve Carrell's choice of accent may be annoying sometimes, but it didn't ruin the experience at all. The think this movie had a very good script as well. The dialogue, the pacing, everything was well written. The editing is perfect. It does start off a tiny bit slow, but still not dull. It's funny all the way throughout. The music was great as well. Rapper/Producer/N.E.R.D. lead Pharrell Williams did the music, and it was excellent. Nice mix of a variety of music genres, all toned together perfectly. There are plenty of winning concept in the film. I mentioned that it reminded me of The Grinch, but it was still very creative. It was a lot better than Megamind. And I say that because the two are both told from a villains perspective, so they're bound to be compared. Why are Universal and DreamWorks releasing FOUR movies in the same year anyway? Aren't they still married (corporately, I mean)? I don't know, out if so, I guess they're trying to stay relevant so that Disney doesn't destroy their line-up when Oscar season comes, with Toy Story 3 and Tangled. Sadly, it probably will anyway. I say sadly because I'm one of the few who liked How To Train Your Dragon just a sliver of a tiny tad bit more than Toy Story 3. Back to this movie. There were some things I had a little trouble coping with. The main thing is, and this may sound stupid because it's a cartoon, but I had a little trouble coping with the obvious and complete lack of realism (a stupid nitpick, I admit, but hear me out).This movie felt too much like an episode of The Looney Toons, with sharks eating Gru, and a dozen missiles hitting him in the face, yet he walks away unscathed. It is very much stupid for me to complain about that, because, like I said, it's a cartoon, but it conflicts with the touching emotional tone other scenes try to set. Even so, I think it's a great movie for the whole family. The show stealers by far are the minions. I loved the minions so much. They never ceased to make me smile, crack up, or flat out bust out with laughter. They were awesome. Easily the best thing about the movie, which means a lot. I also liked the little girl, Agnes. She was cute, and actually a strong character. So, I highly recommend this movie to anyone, and everyone. Young or old. Hopefully Despicable Me will not be forgotten in the shadow of Toy Story 3, How To Train Your Dragon, and Tangled, all of which made 2010 an incredible year for Animation. As everyone should expect, the transfer is perfect. At least it is to someone like me, who isn't a video or audiophile (with that being said, I should add that I watch my Blus on a 46"" Samsung LCD and have a 5.1 receiver connected with four speakers, so I can tell the difference). The picture is as sharp as any of the Pixar or Dreamworks films I own. There really aren't many different textures in this movie. After watching the four Shreks on Blu this week, I have a certain standard of texture variations that I prefer to see in animated films. In the four Shreks you see fur, skin, scales, different clothings, and much more.So with that said, Despicable has a very plain texture palette, which probably won't bother anyone. It didn't really bother me, but I noticed it. Anyway, the colors pop off of the screen, and detail is above par. The audio is equally impressive. There are a lot of mixed sounds that intersect. At any given moment, voices, sound effects and music will all play at the same time. Yet, not once was I unable to decipher any of it. All around, it's a perfect transfer in my book. For my fellow slipcover enthusiasts, there is a healthy option available on the market. As far as extras go, there aren't a whole lot, but what's there is decent enough I guess. Compared to the features on Pixar's library, I cannot bring myself to be too generous with my rating of the extras. There just aren't enough. I love the minions (like I said before), but their three mini movies combined only last a good 8 or 9 minutes (with at least 3 minutes added from the credits). There is a commentary with the directors and the minions. I cannot wait to sit through it on my second viewing. There are the above mentioned three minion mini movies (Orientation Day, Home Makeover and Banana). There is a 16 minute documentary on the voice talent of the film (The Voices of Despicable Me), a 15 minute documentary on the story (The World of Despicable Me), as well as a 3 minute clip of the composer, Pharrell Williams, and his music (Despicable Beats). I really liked the fact that a Hip-Hop/R&B; artist did the music, but this clip (I call it a clip because it's too short to be considered a documentary) did not give any useful information. There are also a few games and other activities for kids. It's really a well-rounded package. Definitely a must own for families (or twenty-something-year-old college students like myself).",4,Gru-tifully Sweet Family Film,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,6346,"['opinion', 'Despicable', 'Me',

1302506,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002ZG97E2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 4]","Despicable Me (Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, 2010)It's been well over two months since I saw Despicable Me, the all-too-cute first directorial feature from Coffin and Renaud (the latter of whom worked on No Time for Nuts, a short for the Ice Age franchise), and I still haven't reviewed it. I seem to recall having had this same problem with Kung Fu Panda a couple of years ago. What is it about me a kidflicks that doesn't seem to get along, even when I find them eminently enjoyable? No idea, but there it is. Which oddly is exactly what I feel like saying about Despicable Me; to this day, I have no real idea why I enjoyed it as much as I did, and yet here we are.Gru (voice of Steve Carrell) and Vector (voice of Jason Segel) are both arch-criminals. Well, Gru is an arch-criminal, while Vector is more of a screwup arch-criminal wannabe. In any case, they both find themselves competing with one another for loans at the Bank of Evil on a fairly regular basis. When one of those loans goes to Vector (unfairly, Gru thinks), he develops a plot to break into Vector's stronghold and steal a component for a new super-weapon Vector is developing (and will, of course, screw up given the chance). Thus, he adopts three orphans, dresses them up as girl scouts, and sends them off to Vector's to sell robotic cookies that will double as bugs. All well and good, but once the plan goes off, what to do with the kids? Gru finds himself transformed overnight into the role of dad. From there, it's as sappy and predictable a tale of redemption as they come.And yet still, as much as I should hate that sappiness and predictability, it works. And (I don't think this is a spoiler) I don't think it works because Gru is supposed to go through some sort of ""I'm no longer a villain!"" redemption and doesn't; I think it works because Gru isn't really much of a villain to begin with. He's way too cute and cuddly (as opposed to the odd angularity of Vector, who looks for all the world like Bill Gates to Gru's Bela Lugosi). Yeah, sure, his house is littered with stolen art, but still, even at the beginning, the guy's not a rough-and-tumble criminal. And this is one of those times when I know I should be ripping this movie apart for that, and I just can't because of the cute factor. And the more I realize that the more I realize how manipulative this movie was, and still, I just can't do it. While it's nowhere near in the league of a Kung Fu Panda or even a Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, are the kids going to complain about it? Absolutely not.

But Gru's life is eventually turned around after he adopts three adorable tykes whom he initially intends to make unwitting participants in his diabolical plan but who, instead, wind up making him question his own commitment to a life of crime.Directed by Peter Coffin and Chris Renaud, ""Despicable Me"" is a colorful, witty and fast-paced animated feature that has just the right amount of humor, sentiment and moral lessons to make it a well-balanced treat for children and oldsters alike.  The frequent and exciting action sequences also make this ideal viewing for those with deficient attention spans (which seems to include just about all of us these days).

But I found this very funny,with impressive graphic design, & very original (as opposed to the line-up of Shrek sequels, for example)--a great script & terrific voice acting. My only reservation is that it's clearly made for 3-D, so in 2-D there are a lot of kinetic moments that are made for the process & not necessarily for the flow of the narrative & the comfort of the viewer. (I'm assuming it was originally released theatrically with a 3-D option.) There are a lot of things flying &#34;in your face,&#34; coming at you rather that moving laterally. A bit of this isn't bad, but I found two things happening. First, after the first hour I began to feel assaulted visually, animation fatigue. Second, I began to feel like an outsider--someone for whom the movie, as clever as it is, was not intended. It's a small reservation though.

You make half a billion bucks (to date) with your first go-around in the director's chair for a full length animated feature. Sheesh.

1302596,A3V79KXIY09MOE,B002ZG97E2,"Stacy ""Amazon Junkie""","[0, 0]","As an aficionado of cartoon movies, Despicable Me landed in my sights and I remember eagerly going to see it in theatres. As soon as it was released on DVD I secured my copy from the local store, and a couple years later I can say that I still laugh just as hard today as I did when I first saw it at the 2:30 matinee when it was in theatres.Animation and SoundDespicable Me, an animated comedy presented in both 3D and 2D screenings, is the story of supervillain Gru and his desire to become world-famous for daring capers and heists. Voiced by Steve Carrell, he has a comically shaped body (bowling-ball bald head, carrot-shaped nose, huge torso and skinny legs), with a Russian accent reminiscent of Boris Badinov.The animation itself in the 3D screening is very good; the colors are bright and the small details (worn paint on doors, facial expressions are varied and comical) really do add a nice depth to the film. In terms of the 3D, the movie does deliver but not in any ""WOW!!"" way. On the upside, the 3D does not feel like a gimmick, either, and the usage of it is both comical and appropriate (the roller coaster ride was awesome and made my stomach do flip flops). In some instances the 3D was a bit blurry, but only during ""movement"" sequences. For the most part, the 3D was crisp (even though I had to wear the glasses over my own).The lip-synching of the characters was also very impressive, looking natural and well-made. The voices of the characters were great matches, with my only complaint being the voice of the children. With the exception of the youngest girl, the voices seemed a bit ""old"" for them. It may just be me, but what I am assuming is a 12 year old girl sounds more like an older teenager. Granted, I understand that the eldest, Margo, is supposed to be the ""maternal"" sibling who is watching out for the other two, but a younger voice would have matched the face a bit better.The music soundtrack for this movie is cute and matches the action. There is nothing especially memorable about it, however, so I do not think that I will be going out of my way to purchase the CD.StoryDespicable Me is very funny, with a clever script and a lot of subtle puns. For instance, Gru applies for a loan through the Bank of Evil; a note on the entrance says ""Formerly Lehman Brothers"" - obviously a tongue-in-cheek reference and meant more for the adults in the theatre.The plot is simple: Gru plans to steal the moon. To do this, he needs a shrink ray. The movie centers around this concept, trying to explain how Gru will accomplish his goal while balancing his adoption of three oprhan sisters.It is important to remember that this is a kid's movie, so many of the jokes contained therein are geared for a younger crowd. By now, I am sure that many people have seen the Despicable Me commercial that involves the ""fart gun""; while I generally think jokes about bodily functions are tasteless, the movie manages to result in many laugh-out-loud moments that revolve around relatively ""juvenile"" behavior.With all of this being said, the story is a bit predictable (at least, the overall plot), but what makes this movie great is how you get to the end. Gru's ""evil"" personality results in some great comedic moments. Although Gru tries to be a great villain, his antics usually come across as the petulant actions of a vindictive child. Freezing patrons in the coffeehouse to cut to the front of the line, parallel parking and bumping cars out of the way, driving a huge rocket-powered car that pollutes like mad; these are the extent of Gru's villainry. I found myself laughing quite often at all of this, though, if only because Gru's dedication to evil is so, well, dedicated.Finally, the three orphaned girls who are adopted by Gru and his yellow tic-tac shaped minions are true scene-stealers. The girls are adorable in their resolution, having had to fend for themselves in an orphanage with a self-serving and cruel headmistress. The minions are die-hardedly loyal to Gru, willing to sacrifice themselves for their villainous boss. The girls have a great sense of humor and are rascals, the minions speak in their own language and whack each other whenever possible. There are so many minion and little girl scenes with hysterical commentary and animation that you will definitely feel that the price of the movie admission is worth it.In short, while the plot isn't groundbreaking or even ""new"", the jokes and wonderful voice talents within the movie will keep you entertained. Even my husband, who normally is not thrilled with ""kiddie"" movies was chuckling very hard at some moments.The Final VerdictI highly recommend this title for anyone who wants a lighthearted comedy with a heartwarming tale. While you will undoubtedly be able to guess the ending of the movie very early on, sit back and enjoy the jokes and story as it develops. This movie will probably be booed by critics due to its predictability, but I can honestly say that I laughed harder at this movie than I have laughed at any movie for a long while. In fact, the laughs are very much in-line with some of the comic antics from other animated films (such as Shrek), with the script showing the talents of the voice actors and animators. Despicable Me is a fun romp through the warped mind of super villain Gru, resulting in a solid movie that is great for both kids and adults.

One theater goer was in tears by the end of the movie from laughing so hard. She had to have been in her 80s. We've since seen the movie in our home at least 20xs or more. This is a movie you will not tire of watching over and over and over again!Gru (the main character voiced by Steve Carell) has been acclaimed as the worlds greatest villain until he is trumped by another newer and younger villain who steals the Pyramid of Giza. Gru decides he will not be out done and sets out to ""Steal zee moon"" with the help of his hysterical Minions (think weebles with arms) and his evil scientist. What follows is a comedic series of moments and mayhem as Gru attempts to accomplish his goal by adopting Agnes, Edith and Margo from a girls home with the full intention of never keeping them once their usefulness has passed. The girls quickly worm their way into the hearts of Gru and his minions. Toss in to the mix Julie Andrews as Gru's not-so-loving mother and Russell Brand as his hard-of-hearing Evil Scientist and you have the perfect movie!If you want a more in-depth look of the movie (I hate spoilers!) check out the previews and reviews on youtube.Just a FEW quotes you will walk away with:""It's so fluffy I'm going to die!""""That book was accidentally destroyed maliciously.""""Piranha Gun ...

Heck sometimes in the movie the other characters will make you laugh, but I wont be suprise if the Minions get their own spinoff.The 1 disc comes with some special features:*Despicable Beats- a short video of making the music*Gru's Rocket Builder- a little game*A Global Effort- the crew talking about how some of the animation was done in *Commentary with Directors Chris Renaud & Pierre Coffin Featuring the MinionsThe two disc comes with a little more, some videos on the characters and 3 shorts (Mentioned)This is a fun movie for people of all agesPros:-Cute plot-The MinionsCons:-Could have had more special features",4,"Its so fluffy, Im going to die!",1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,1485,"['Now', 'weird', 'animated', 'film', 'world', 'wait..2nd', 'best', 'supervillian', 'guy', 'name', 'Gru', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'who', 'steal', 'moon', 'most', 'need', 'help', '3', 'little', 'orphans', 'sound', 'little', 'corney', 'especially', 'when', 'Gru', 'minions', 'are..little', 'yellow', 'men', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'dont', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'saying.The', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'star', 'cast', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Sound', 'music', 'Shrek', '2', 'etc', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Blades', 'Glory', 'etc', 'Russel', 'Brand', 'Get', 'Greek', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'How', 'met', 'mother', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'Hangover', 'Community', 'Jack', 'McBrayer', '30', 'Rock', 'moreProbably', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'minions', 'most', 'funny', 'scenes', 'involve', 'fact', 'buy', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'get', '3', 'mini', 'movies', 'starring', 'Minions', 'Heck', 'sometimes', 'movie', 'other', 'characters', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'wont', 'be', 'suprise', 'Minions', 'get', 'own', 'spinoff.The', '1', 'disc', 'special', 'features', '*Despicable', 'Beats-', 'short', 'video', 'making', 'music*Gru', 'Rocket', 'Builder-', 'little', 'game*A', 'Global', 'Effort-', 'crew', 'talking', 'how', 'animation', 'was', 'done', '*Commentary', 'Directors', 'Chris', 'Renaud', 'Pierre', 'Coffin', 'Featuring', 'MinionsThe', 'two', 'disc', 'little', 'more', 'videos', 'characters', '3', 'shorts', 'Mentioned', 'fun', 'movie', 'people', 'agesPros', '-Cute', 'plot-The', 'MinionsCons', '-Could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'special', 'features']",N/A

This is the only cartoon I know that shows children praying, and it also promotes reading (my three year old who did not have much interest in books beforehand started asking us to read him stories after this movie).  And it is so full of excitement and fun that kids can never get bored.

1302636,A1ZAN7KBME97B3,B002ZG97E2,Tiger100M,"[0, 0]","I have mixed thoughts about ""Despicable Me"". I did find it funny and enjoyable more than ""Megamind"", another villain movie came out that year. I mean, ""Megamind"" did tell a good story, but it more for super heroes against super villains rather than villains in general like ""Despicable Me"". I don't LOVE this film, but there are a few things about that stand out about this film...and a few serious problems, on par with ""Tangled"".  I like how Gru changes from a bad guy to good guy with the love of the three girls. Margo is responsible and protective, Agnes is very cute, Edith, eh, I tend to overlook her the most out of the three girls, but her tomboy personality is enjoyable. The minions are enjoyably funny as well, and of course some of the jokes. So why don't I love this film the way everyone else does? Because there are 3 cruel mean-spirited characters that kind of ruin the film for me. One is Ms. Hattie the orphanage owner. She's abusive, cruel, and unfunny. If the filmmakers thought Ms. Hattie's cruelty was supposed to be funny, it totally backfires in my opinion. The second is Mr. Perkins of the villain bank. The way he uses age discrimination against Gru is really unfair, and I thought it was obviously meant just for an excuse to help Vector get the moon! The third is Dr. Nefario, Gru's elderly scientist. I just don't like that guy. I found his hearing problem funny at first, but when he forced Gru to get rid of the girls, I stopped thinking positive of him. He didn't even take responsibility for what he did, and Gru ended up taking the blame, when he said he never should have given up the girls. Why should Gru apologize something for he didn't really do? Dr. Nefario was he one who got rid of them. That is a serious flaw! I was actually hoping Dr. Nefario would get fired or die of old age. Overall, despite ""Despicable Me""s problems, I guess I'm okay with it enough to watch with my friends and family. It is funny and all, but I don't think it that great.

1302655,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002ZG97E2,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Despicable Me"" is a computer animated film from Universal Pictures / Illumination Entertainment. The delightful comedy revolved around one criminal mastermind named Gru (voice by Steve Carell), who, inspired by the recent heist of a pyramid, vows to become the world's greatest villain by stealing the moon.To do so, however, he needs to borrow from the Bank of Evil. To convince the bank's president Mr. Perkins (Will Arnett) that the project is worth the investment, Gru has to get a ""shrink ray"" (you can't just carry the moon in your pocket). And to steal the gun from another supervillain wannabe Vector (Jason Segel) ... well, in short, he adopts three orphaned girls Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) for his grand heist plan.The story of ""Despicable Me"" begins in a digressive manner, making room for Gru the film's ""supervillain"" to show what kind of a person he really is, and what he can do with his faithful assistant and inventor Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) and yellow-colored likable ""minions."" Eventually the story comes down to the bond between the three girls and their surrogate father, but like in a French animation ""The Triplets of Belleville,"" the story is there for the imagination to be explored in the Golden Globe nominated film.The real strength of ""Despicable Me"" lies in its main character Gru (who looks and acts a bit like Mr. Bean), and his world full of brilliant colors and wry humor. Perhaps the film would have been much better with more distinctive personalities given to the little girls. Still, the film is a very enjoyable ride with a nice blend of humor, sentiment and action.",5,(4.5 STARS) Gru Steals the Moon,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,1654,"['Despicable', 'Me', 'computer', 'animated', 'film', 'Universal', 'Pictures', '/', 'Illumination', 'Entertainment', 'delightful', 'comedy', 'revolved', 'one', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'named', 'Gru', 'voice', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'who', 'inspired', 'recent', 'heist', 'pyramid', 'become', 'world', 'greatest', 'villain', 'stealing', 'moon.To', 'do', 'so', 'however', 'borrow', 'Bank', 'Evil', 'convince', 'bank', 'president', 'Mr.', 'Perkins', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'project', 'investment', 'Gru', 'get', 'shrink', 'ray', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'carry', 'moon', 'pocket', 'steal', 'gun', 'supervillain', 'wannabe', 'Vector', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'well', 'short', 'three', 'orphaned', 'girls', 'Margo', 'Miranda', 'Cosgrove', 'Edith', 'Dana', 'Gaier', 'Agnes', 'Elsie', 'Fisher', 'grand', 'heist', 'plan.The', 'story', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'digressive', 'manner', 'making', 'room', 'Gru', 'film', 'supervillain', 'show', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'really', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'faithful', 'assistant', 'inventor', 'Dr.', 'Nefario', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'yellow-colored', 'likable', 'minions', 'Eventually', 'story', 'down', 'bond', 'three', 'girls', 'surrogate', 'father', 'French', 'animation', 'Triplets', 'Belleville', 'story', 'there', 'imagination', 'be', 'explored', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominated', 'film.The', 'real', 'strength', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'main', 'character', 'Gru', 'who', 'bit', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'world', 'full', 'brilliant', 'colors', 'wry', 'humor', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'distinctive', 'personalities', 'given', 'little', 'girls', 'Still', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'nice', 'blend', 'humor', 'sentiment', 'action']",N/A

I am sure you are curious as to why. The acting was great I want to get that off the bat right away. Steve Carrell is an actor that always wows me with every performance live action or voice acting. Giving any actor who is normally looked at as the `good guy' a chance to play a villain is something they always jump at. The supporting cast was also great, Russell Brand was probably the biggest surprise for me just because of the character he voiced.What I hated about this movie was the story. Seeing all the trailers of this movie I really thought this was going to be a film about super villains just going at it trying to headway the crime of the century instead, this film turned out to be nothing but a Disney wanna be, by having Steve Carrells character adopt three orphan girls. Not that I had anything against the characters because the little one was just way too cute. Still, this movie tried way too hard to get at your emotions taking away from the whole super villain element. Also, because of this plot point Jason Siegel gets barely the screen time he deserved in this movie. I am sorry, but if you want to make a Disney movie make sure that Disney does it. I mean yes this film had to go up against Toy Story 3 and there was no way that Despicable Me was even going to match that movie from an emotional standpoint.It's films like this one that make me so mad that animation always has to be stereo typed as being geared towards children or has to be something the whole family can enjoy. Just because it is a cartoon doesn't mean it has to be tame. South Park and the Simpsons got it right making sure their films got PG-13 and above.

1302683,AP3B615GM191G,B002ZG97E2,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[3, 5]","After pretty much working my way through all the Disney/Pixar animated films, ""Despicable Me"" was my first venture into Universal territory.  The filmmaking styles are most definitely different, although I would argue that Pixar still holds a big edge.For a basic plot summary, ""Despicable Me"" tells the story of Dr. Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), a supervillian trying to stay on top of the supervillian world.  While dueling with the young, up-and-coming supervillians, Dr. Gru gets involved with a trio of orphan girls who eventually lend him some basic humanity.Clearly, Universal utilizes a completely different formula than Pixar.  Here, the animation is a little goofier and the action almost never ceases.  A bit of emotion is still injected into the film, but nowhere near Pixar levels.  In this case, the never-ending action gets a bit tiresome and the emotion is actually a bit too little, too late.Overall, however, ""Despicable Me"" will entertain all children with its fast pace, quirky humor, and abundance of sight gags.  For folks any older, though, it just doesn't measure up to the Pixar stable of emotional depth and all-ages humor.",3,A Different Approach Than Pixar,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,1149,"['pretty', 'much', 'working', 'way', 'Disney/Pixar', 'animated', 'films', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'was', 'first', 'venture', 'Universal', 'territory', 'filmmaking', 'styles', 'are', 'most', 'definitely', 'different', 'would', 'argue', 'Pixar', 'still', 'big', 'edge.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Gru', 'voiced', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'supervillian', 'trying', 'stay', 'top', 'supervillian', 'world', 'dueling', 'young', 'up-and-coming', 'supervillians', 'Dr.', 'Gru', 'involved', 'trio', 'orphan', 'girls', 'who', 'eventually', 'lend', 'basic', 'humanity.Clearly', 'Universal', 'completely', 'different', 'formula', 'Pixar', 'Here', 'animation', 'little', 'goofier', 'action', 'almost', 'never', 'ceases', 'bit', 'emotion', 'still', 'injected', 'film', 'nowhere', 'Pixar', 'levels', 'case', 'never-ending', 'action', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'emotion', 'actually', 'bit', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.Overall', 'however', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'will', 'entertain', 'children', 'fast', 'pace', 'quirky', 'humor', 'abundance', 'sight', 'gags', 'folks', 'older', 'just', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'Pixar', 'stable', 'emotional', 'depth', 'all-ages', 'humor']",N/A
