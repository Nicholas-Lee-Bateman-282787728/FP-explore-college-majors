1420971,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B004NEF9G4,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[1, 1]","The eight (8) short films on this disc that runs about an hour and 44 minutes with each film varying in length from about three (3) minutes to about twenty (20) minutes in length, offered some very enjoyable short gay-themed films.  Although I enjoyed all of the films, a few were very enjoyable and memorable to me.Of all eight (8) short movies, my favorite was the fifteen minute short ""Gaysharktank.com"".  That film hysterically showed us a fictional Gay website offering the lonely and alone persons a place to connect with like people.  What a funny bunch of people.  We are introduced to a lonely wife that finds her missing husband on the site; women looking for sperm and drag-queens looking for mates plus a host of other funny characters.  Another short that I adored was the twelve (12) minute ""Gayby"" about two (2) college friends (a gay man and a straight woman) that try to ""naturally"" produce a baby--the scene of them in bed together is very funny!  There are also serious themed films that were very entertaining to me too (i.e., ""After"" ""Bedfellows--I cried at that one, and ""My name is Love"") All in all I really enjoyed this compilation.",4,Enjoyable Gay shorts,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,1157,"['eight', '8', 'short', 'films', 'disc', 'hour', '44', 'minutes', 'film', 'varying', 'length', 'three', '3', 'minutes', 'twenty', '20', 'minutes', 'length', 'offered', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'short', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'few', 'were', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'memorable', 'me.Of', 'eight', '8', 'short', 'movies', 'favorite', 'was', 'fifteen', 'minute', 'short', 'Gaysharktank.com', 'film', 'hysterically', 'showed', 'fictional', 'Gay', 'website', 'offering', 'lonely', 'alone', 'persons', 'place', 'connect', 'like', 'people', 'What', 'funny', 'bunch', 'people', 'are', 'introduced', 'lonely', 'wife', 'missing', 'husband', 'site', 'women', 'looking', 'sperm', 'drag-queens', 'looking', 'mates', 'host', 'other', 'funny', 'characters', 'short', 'adored', 'was', 'twelve', '12', 'minute', 'Gayby', 'two', '2', 'college', 'friends', 'gay', 'man', 'straight', 'woman', 'try', 'naturally', 'produce', 'baby', 'scene', 'bed', 'together', 'very', 'funny', 'are', 'also', 'serious', 'themed', 'films', 'were', 'very', 'entertaining', 'too', 'i.e.', 'Bedfellows', 'cried', 'one', 'name', 'Love', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'compilation']",N/A

I think its the first time I've ever cried watching a short film and yet by the end, I was grinning ear to ear.  The soundtrack also really swept me along as a rather hypnotic dream sequence unfolded in a gorgeous way.  Excellent, excellent stuff.CURIOUS THING - 6/10 - I remembered this one a bit different from when I saw it first.  I liked it again but the emotional reaction I had to it wasn't there this time, maybe because I had just watched After which is rather similar. A good film but it went by pretty quick.GAYBY - 9/10 - Had seen this one and it holds up on 2nd viewing.  The one film with a legit female character, and she really serves it in a great comedic performance, while her hot male counterpart is pretty funny too.  The scene on the roof was very meloncholy and it was a great touch after making us laugh so much during the bedroom scene.GAYSHARKTANK.COM - 7/10 - Another film that I remembered differently that maybe didn't feel the same on 2nd view.  Really funny at times, but for whatever reason I felt there were moments where it dragged (no pun intened).  Highlights were wife looking for her husband on the site and the trans hooker who offered 'parties!'MY NAME IS LOVE - 6/10 - The one film I'd have maybe skipped.  I guess I can understand if people like this kind of film but felt a bit too slow, the only one over 20 minutes.  Also have to say that trying to make one of the characters' major indiscretions seem pitiable turned me off, plus the film just sort of ends in an odd place.  Take it or leave it.MOUSE'S BIRTHDAY - 7/10 - I watched this one twice just because it went by so quickly.  Avant-garde stuff in queer films is always a welcome thing for me, it's where queer films started, and this is the queerest of the films on the DVD.  Intriguing visual style, and it's better than the standard mindless gay comedies for sure.STEAM - 8/10 - This is maybe the one film in the collection that seems groundbreaking, but yet its flawed as well.  It is political, it is philosophical, and yet its sexy as well.  The ending came out of nowhere and yet I was wondering what the director meant by it (is he/she straight??).  But the fact that it makes me think about it after I watched it means the director came up with something weightier than a standard gay short, and we need more of those vs. the same.",5,The true cream of the crop,1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,2903,"['saw', 'several', 'shorts', 'film', 'festival', 'hoped', ""'d"", 'eventually', 'find', 'iTunes', 'one', 'comps', 'watching', 'entire', 'collection', ""'m"", 'now', 'more', 'fan', 'ones', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'AFTER', '7/10', 'Not', 'gon', 'lie', 'object', 'three', 'guys', 'affection', 'was', 'little', 'hunkier', ""'d"", 'have', 'maybe', 'made', '8/10', 'can', 'totally', 'identify', 'crushing', 'str8', 'jocks', 'school', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'more', 'not', 'being', 'so', 'melodramatic', 'end.BEDFELLOWS', '10/10', 'one', 'was', 'such', 'knockout', 'terms', 'visuals', 'acting', 'think', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'cried', 'watching', 'short', 'film', 'yet', 'end', 'was', 'grinning', 'ear', 'ear', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'really', 'swept', 'along', 'rather', 'hypnotic', 'dream', 'sequence', 'unfolded', 'gorgeous', 'way', 'Excellent', 'excellent', 'stuff.CURIOUS', 'THING', '6/10', 'remembered', 'one', 'bit', 'different', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'liked', 'again', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'had', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'time', 'maybe', 'had', 'just', 'watched', 'rather', 'similar', 'good', 'film', 'went', 'pretty', 'quick.GAYBY', '9/10', 'Had', 'seen', 'one', 'up', '2nd', 'viewing', 'one', 'film', 'legit', 'female', 'character', 'really', 'great', 'comedic', 'performance', 'hot', 'male', 'counterpart', 'pretty', 'funny', 'too', 'scene', 'roof', 'was', 'very', 'meloncholy', 'was', 'great', 'touch', 'making', 'so', 'much', 'bedroom', 'scene.GAYSHARKTANK.COM', '7/10', 'film', 'remembered', 'differently', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', '2nd', 'view', 'Really', 'funny', 'times', 'reason', 'felt', 'were', 'moments', 'where', 'dragged', 'pun', 'intened', 'Highlights', 'were', 'wife', 'looking', 'husband', 'site', 'trans', 'hooker', 'who', 'offered', ""'parties"", 'NAME', 'IS', 'LOVE', '6/10', 'one', 'film', ""'d"", 'have', 'maybe', 'skipped', 'guess', 'can', 'understand', 'people', 'kind', 'film', 'felt', 'bit', 'too', 'slow', 'only', 'one', '20', 'minutes', 'Also', 'have', 'say', 'trying', 'make', 'one', 'characters', 'major', 'indiscretions', 'seem', 'pitiable', 'turned', 'off', 'film', 'just', 'sort', 'ends', 'odd', 'place', 'Take', 'leave', 'it.MOUSE', 'BIRTHDAY', '7/10', 'watched', 'one', 'twice', 'just', 'went', 'quickly', 'Avant-garde', 'stuff', 'queer', 'films', 'always', 'welcome', 'thing', 'where', 'queer', 'films', 'started', 'queerest', 'films', 'DVD', 'Intriguing', 'visual', 'style', 'better', 'standard', 'mindless', 'gay', 'comedies', 'sure.STEAM', '8/10', 'maybe', 'one', 'film', 'collection', 'groundbreaking', 'yet', 'flawed', 'well', 'political', 'philosophical', 'yet', 'sexy', 'well', 'ending', 'came', 'nowhere', 'yet', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'director', 'meant', 'he/she', 'straight', 'fact', 'think', 'watched', 'director', 'came', 'up', 'something', 'weightier', 'standard', 'gay', 'short', 'need', 'more', 'same']",N/A
1420973,A1IBXVGE12FM1Y,B004NEF9G4,Joe G,"[1, 1]",The shorts included in this anthology are of varying quality. The short based on the poem by Dennis Cooper in which three boys fantasize about the same hunk is by far the most original and interesting.  Bedfellows is sweet in the good way.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","There are so many different compilations of short films on the DVD market, it's a gamble and a mixed bag dropping your money on any collection sight unseen.  Usually, there are pieces you like and some you loathe, some that seem professional and some that seem cobbled together.  I'm pleased that, in general, the ""fest selects"" assortment included on Volume One of Best Gay Shorts is a solid (and somewhat surprising, in a good way) group.The highpoint, for me, is the Swedish entry MY NAME IS LOVE.  Well acted and disturbing, this is a terrific piece.  I also enjoyed CURIOUS THING about the blurring of lines between friendship and relationship and discovering one's self.  And I enjoyed the ethereal quirkiness of AFTER.  Several of the other choices tackle familiar themes in comedic ways--one about a dating Internet site even has some famous faces!After loving the first 6 selections, a bizarre music video did little to peak my interest but was brief.  And lastly, the film ends with a erotic film STEAM that morphs into an existential drama (picture Sartre's NO EXIT as a steamroom hook-up).  I'm sure that many will appreciate the effort, but it seemed a bit heavy handed for my taste.All in all, though, this is one of the better compilations I've seen.  About 4 1/2 stars, this is a solid and entertaining collection with enough variety to keep you on your toes.
