1421114,A3KWF0Z9R8TIHM,B004NJC0OI,HoneyBadgerReviews,"[2, 2]","This impressive documentary investigates the disappearance of legendary explorer Percy Fawcett, who apparently died in 1925 in the Amazon jungle while searching for the lost city of `Z'. His disappearance has long been the subject of speculation and has spawned numerous expeditions in an attempt to uncover his fate.Fawcett was an experienced explorer and believed the many legends about gleaming cities in the Amazon.  On this trip he took his 22-year old son and his son's best friend. However, the younger men were ill-prepared for the trip and this expedition was underfunded.In the documentary modern-day outdoorsman Niall McCann examines Fawcett's personal records from the trip, which were sent back to civilization by runners accompanying the journey. However, the team eventually ventured too deep into the jungle to entice any more runners, and Fawcett was never heard from again.Much of the jungle that Fawcett trekked through has since been cut-down. However, this investigative team finds what they believe was his final encampment location (still forested) using Google earth and modern GPS equipment. The documentary covers some possible explanations for their fates.I enjoyed the documentary and Niall McCann's explanations as they went along. However, I felt the material was spread too thin trying to cover every possible aspect of the event. So nothing was examined too deeply. I recommend Secrets of the Dead: Lost in the Amazon but was left wanting more.",3,"Highly interesting, but it only whet my appetite",1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,1476,"['impressive', 'documentary', 'disappearance', 'legendary', 'explorer', 'Percy', 'Fawcett', 'who', 'apparently', 'died', '1925', 'Amazon', 'jungle', 'searching', 'lost', 'city', 'Z', 'disappearance', 'long', 'been', 'subject', 'speculation', 'spawned', 'numerous', 'expeditions', 'attempt', 'uncover', 'fate.Fawcett', 'was', 'experienced', 'explorer', 'believed', 'many', 'legends', 'gleaming', 'cities', 'Amazon', 'trip', 'took', '22-year', 'old', 'son', 'son', 'best', 'friend', 'However', 'younger', 'men', 'were', 'ill-prepared', 'trip', 'expedition', 'was', 'underfunded.In', 'documentary', 'modern-day', 'outdoorsman', 'Niall', 'McCann', 'Fawcett', 'personal', 'records', 'trip', 'were', 'sent', 'back', 'civilization', 'runners', 'accompanying', 'journey', 'However', 'team', 'eventually', 'ventured', 'too', 'deep', 'jungle', 'entice', 'more', 'runners', 'Fawcett', 'was', 'never', 'heard', 'again.Much', 'jungle', 'Fawcett', 'trekked', 'been', 'cut-down', 'However', 'investigative', 'team', 'what', 'believe', 'was', 'final', 'encampment', 'location', 'still', 'forested', 'using', 'Google', 'earth', 'modern', 'GPS', 'equipment', 'documentary', 'covers', 'possible', 'explanations', 'fates.I', 'enjoyed', 'documentary', 'Niall', 'McCann', 'explanations', 'went', 'along', 'However', 'felt', 'material', 'was', 'spread', 'too', 'thin', 'trying', 'cover', 'possible', 'aspect', 'event', 'nothing', 'was', 'examined', 'too', 'deeply', 'recommend', 'Secrets', 'Dead', 'Lost', 'Amazon', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'more']",N/A
1421115,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B004NJC0OI,Jeffery Mingo,"[2, 10]","Mr. Fawcett was trying to find a supposed lost city in South America circa 1925 and was never seen again.  This happened after Macchu Pichu (sp?) was discovered in the 1910s.  This work tries to spell out why he took this risk and what could have happened to him.  It tries to make the issue relevant to modern viewers by stating that Fawcett may have been an influence for the Indiana Jones character.  Many search parties set out to find him and some of those searchers died trying.This work tries hard to vindicate Mr. Fawcett.  It said that rings in the ground do show that a relatively advance civilization may have lived in the area Fawcett was searching.  However, the work stated that many people made phony maps because they wanted to trick investors into paying for their escapades.  Fawcett believed a lot of stuff that swamis and gurus said to him and maybe he was gullible.  I don't want to laugh at anyone's death, especially if it happens tragically.  But maybe this Fawcett guy was just naive and foolish!  In fact, the work is a bit straw man:  they only give their hypothesis about how he, his son, and his son's friend died way near the end and it's anti-climactic and not thrilling or racy in the slightest.Wearing my non-Eurocentric cap, I have some more concerns.  (By the way, the narrator's pronunciation of Spanish words is atrocious, almost as bad as Dr. Skip Gates'.)  The narrator repeats that this supposed city was built by ""white Indians.""  Is there racism in that idea?  Is it implied that brown or red people could not have made advanced structures?  Were the Indians called white because white adventurers wanted their ancestors to be the only ones given credit for impressive structures?  In hot South America, why would any indigenous group of people be white-skinned?  Why didn't Fawcett implicitly know that a tale about white Indians would surely be some hogwash?  This reminded me of the facts behind Truman Capote's ""In Cold Blood.""  If you want to believe something stupid, you could end up dying trying to pursue what you want to see, rather than reality.  I hate to mention the Darwin Awards, but that's popping into my head as I type.From a green perspective, this was very hard to watch.  Areas of South America that were once verdant are now a dull yellowish-brown due to deforestation.  I once heard that the Amazon River area provide Earth with 1/3 of its oxygen.  I'm not sure if this human manipulation will help us and other animals survive.",2,Impressive Leader Dies on Stupid Mission,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,2493,"['Mr.', 'Fawcett', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'supposed', 'lost', 'city', 'South', 'America', 'circa', '1925', 'was', 'never', 'seen', 'again', 'happened', 'Macchu', 'Pichu', 'sp', 'was', 'discovered', '1910s', 'work', 'spell', 'out', 'why', 'took', 'risk', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'make', 'issue', 'relevant', 'modern', 'viewers', 'stating', 'Fawcett', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'influence', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'character', 'Many', 'search', 'parties', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'searchers', 'died', 'trying.This', 'work', 'tries', 'hard', 'vindicate', 'Mr.', 'Fawcett', 'said', 'rings', 'ground', 'do', 'show', 'relatively', 'advance', 'civilization', 'may', 'have', 'lived', 'area', 'Fawcett', 'was', 'searching', 'However', 'work', 'stated', 'many', 'people', 'made', 'phony', 'maps', 'wanted', 'trick', 'investors', 'paying', 'escapades', 'Fawcett', 'believed', 'lot', 'stuff', 'swamis', 'gurus', 'said', 'maybe', 'was', 'gullible', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'laugh', 'anyone', 'death', 'especially', 'tragically', 'maybe', 'Fawcett', 'guy', 'was', 'just', 'naive', 'foolish', 'fact', 'work', 'bit', 'straw', 'man', 'only', 'give', 'hypothesis', 'how', 'son', 'son', 'friend', 'died', 'way', 'end', 'anti-climactic', 'not', 'thrilling', 'racy', 'slightest.Wearing', 'non-Eurocentric', 'cap', 'have', 'more', 'concerns', 'way', 'narrator', 'pronunciation', 'Spanish', 'words', 'atrocious', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'Dr', 'Skip', 'Gates', 'narrator', 'supposed', 'city', 'was', 'built', 'white', 'Indians', 'there', 'racism', 'idea', 'implied', 'brown', 'red', 'people', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'advanced', 'structures', 'Were', 'Indians', 'called', 'white', 'white', 'adventurers', 'wanted', 'ancestors', 'be', 'only', 'ones', 'given', 'credit', 'impressive', 'structures', 'hot', 'South', 'America', 'why', 'would', 'indigenous', 'group', 'people', 'be', 'white-skinned', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Fawcett', 'implicitly', 'know', 'tale', 'white', 'Indians', 'would', 'surely', 'be', 'hogwash', 'reminded', 'facts', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'want', 'believe', 'something', 'stupid', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'dying', 'trying', 'pursue', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'rather', 'reality', 'hate', 'mention', 'Darwin', 'Awards', 'popping', 'head', 'type.From', 'green', 'perspective', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'Areas', 'South', 'America', 'were', 'once', 'verdant', 'are', 'now', 'dull', 'yellowish-brown', 'due', 'deforestation', 'once', 'heard', 'Amazon', 'River', 'area', 'provide', 'Earth', '1/3', 'oxygen', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'human', 'manipulation', 'will', 'help', 'other', 'animals', 'survive']",N/A

These films are poorly distributed and get little press, so don't let the fact that this latest one gets no fanfare be your reason to skip it. In fact the only reason I got the film was a copy had been quietly displayed at the Academy of Sciences in San Francisco this month.The production is standard in the mix of present day talking heads and lens-filtered re-enactments telling the story of how Col. Percy Fawcett disappeared in the Amazon some 85 years ago looking for a fabled city. The information is crammed together in too little time (runs 60 minutes) and there are definitely moments where I wish they had been more articulate with the locations being shown. For example, the main adventurer guy kept using printed Google Earth maps and showing the people he encountered in the film, but never to the viewer (and unfortunately I failed at being able to pause a quality image and figure out where they really were on my own computer).The information presented is intriguing, though I could go for less of the cheesy re-enacting on the speculations of how they died to fir more research material into the time slot, but it was worth the watch and I feel like I learned some good history. Unfortunately the DVD is bare bones, as there are definitely chances to have included some needed supplements with this topic. The DVD picture and sound are standard but for the volume of overhead footage and fauna being shown a hidef treatment would have be warranted.
