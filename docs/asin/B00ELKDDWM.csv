This 'complete' collection is nothing more than repackaging in a slimmer case and is missing the made for TV movies. A real complete collection would give us all the episodes from Good Morning Miss Bliss (with or without the syndicated introductions), Saved by the Bell, and the College Years remasted and uncut.

1667738,A1D3Y2KFYMTSS3,B00ELKDDWM,John Wells,"[4, 8]","As mentioned, the trip down memory lane is great but the episodes are out of order.  For example, the summer job where Zack and the others work at the resort are in between episodes where school is in session.  The episodes in which Jessie's father marries Leslie are sandwhiched between another episode.  That doesnt make a lot of sense to someone if they have never seen the series before.  Also, the episodes in which they all go to Hawaii are not included.  Nor is Wedding in Las Vegas.  It would have been nice if Lionsgate had included this.

1667742,A2NXAV1SNXWA9H,B00ELKDDWM,S. R.,"[123, 125]","This review will not focus on the merits of this enduring TV series since anyone visiting this page already likes it enough to possibly buy it on DVD.  Rather, this review will hopefully clear up the confusion regarding exactly what is being offered with this Complete Series Collection.  Lionsgate originally releasedSeasons 1 & 2,Seasons 3 & 4, andSeason 5on DVD from 2003 to 2005.  This 2013 Complete Series Collection simply repackages the exact same DVDs from the previous sets, with no additional re-mastering done.  The picture is in its original full frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio while the audio is in 2.0 Dolby digital stereo, with the episodes arranged in order of air date and not storyline order.  There are 13 discs total spanning all 5 seasons of 86 episodes, including a bonus disc of extras exclusive to this collection.  Oddly, theSaved By the Bell: Hawaiian Style/ Wedding In Las Vegasmovies are not included even though they were released on DVD by Lionsgate in 2007.  As for the packaging, this collection comes in a thick cardboard outer sleeve housing two hard plastic cases, each about 1 inches thick with swing trays holding the discs.  In terms of space, this occupies roughly half as much real estate as all the individual releases.The bonus disc contains two newly produced featurettes examining the show's creation and impact.  The 10-minute 'Saturday Morning: From Toons to Teens' highlights how the series found success on the Saturday morning cartoon landscape, while the 15-minute 'It's Alright: Back to the Bell' further explores its genesis and legacy.  Given the rather brief running times and similarity of topics covered, these could easily have been combined into a single featurette.  But then Lionsgate could not have touted this collection as having two all-new special features.  Disappointingly, the only cast members to participate in the new bonus content are the same as before; Lark Voorhies, Dustin Diamond, and Dennis Haskins.  While the new featurettes were interesting, they only mildly elaborate on topics covered by the previously released bonus material.  There is also a paper insert included with the episode titles listed by season, but it does not state what discs the episodes can be found on!  Furthermore, the list is incomplete as it omits several of the final episodes from season 5 (rest assured the episodes are on the discs, though).  Compounding matters, nowhere is there any mention of the previously released extras.  This means that in order to access any of the bonus material including the audio commentaries, one has to go hunting for them disc by disc!  And given there is no 'Special Features' option available on the Menu screens, one has to actually select each episode to see if it features an audio commentary.  This was appallingly negligent of Lionsgate and quite frustrating, and ultimately insulting to the consumer.Overall, with a little more effort and attention to detail, this could have been an exemplary release truly befitting the legacy of such a pop cultural phenomenon.  As it is, for those who own the previous DVD releases, there is little reason to upgrade as the new bonus features lack the meat to warrant repeated viewing.  Those who have waited for a Complete Series Collection should mostly find this worthy of a purchase, even though it was haphazardly produced.",3,Barely Gets A Passing Grade,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,3361,"['review', 'will', 'not', 'focus', 'merits', 'enduring', 'TV', 'series', 'anyone', 'visiting', 'page', 'already', 'enough', 'possibly', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Rather', 'review', 'will', 'hopefully', 'clear', 'up', 'confusion', 'regarding', 'exactly', 'what', 'being', 'offered', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Collection', 'Lionsgate', 'originally', '1', '2', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'andSeason', '5on', 'DVD', '2003', '2005', '2013', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Collection', 'simply', 'exact', 'same', 'DVDs', 'previous', 'sets', 'additional', 're-mastering', 'done', 'picture', 'original', 'full', 'frame', '1.33:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'audio', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'digital', 'stereo', 'episodes', 'arranged', 'order', 'air', 'date', 'not', 'storyline', 'order', 'are', '13', 'discs', 'total', 'spanning', '5', 'seasons', '86', 'episodes', 'including', 'bonus', 'disc', 'extras', 'exclusive', 'collection', 'Oddly', 'theSaved', 'Bell', 'Hawaiian', 'Style/', 'Wedding', 'Las', 'Vegasmovies', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'even', 'were', 'released', 'DVD', 'Lionsgate', '2007', 'packaging', 'collection', 'thick', 'cardboard', 'outer', 'sleeve', 'housing', 'two', 'hard', 'plastic', 'cases', '1', 'inches', 'thick', 'swing', 'trays', 'holding', 'discs', 'terms', 'space', 'roughly', 'half', 'much', 'real', 'estate', 'individual', 'releases.The', 'bonus', 'disc', 'two', 'newly', 'produced', 'featurettes', 'examining', 'show', 'creation', 'impact', '10-minute', ""'Saturday"", 'Morning', 'From', 'Toons', 'Teens', 'highlights', 'how', 'series', 'found', 'success', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'landscape', '15-minute', ""'It"", 'Alright', 'Back', 'Bell', 'further', 'genesis', 'legacy', 'Given', 'rather', 'brief', 'running', 'times', 'similarity', 'topics', 'covered', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'combined', 'single', 'featurette', 'then', 'Lionsgate', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'touted', 'collection', 'having', 'two', 'all-new', 'special', 'features', 'Disappointingly', 'only', 'cast', 'members', 'participate', 'new', 'bonus', 'content', 'are', 'same', 'Lark', 'Voorhies', 'Dustin', 'Diamond', 'Dennis', 'Haskins', 'new', 'featurettes', 'were', 'interesting', 'only', 'mildly', 'elaborate', 'topics', 'covered', 'previously', 'released', 'bonus', 'material', 'also', 'paper', 'insert', 'included', 'episode', 'titles', 'listed', 'season', 'not', 'state', 'what', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Furthermore', 'list', 'incomplete', 'several', 'final', 'episodes', 'season', '5', 'rest', 'assured', 'episodes', 'are', 'discs', 'though', 'Compounding', 'matters', 'mention', 'previously', 'released', 'extras', 'order', 'access', 'bonus', 'material', 'including', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'one', 'go', 'hunting', 'disc', 'disc', 'given', ""'Special"", 'Features', 'option', 'available', 'Menu', 'screens', 'one', 'actually', 'select', 'episode', 'see', 'audio', 'commentary', 'was', 'appallingly', 'negligent', 'Lionsgate', 'quite', 'frustrating', 'ultimately', 'insulting', 'consumer.Overall', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'attention', 'detail', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'exemplary', 'release', 'truly', 'befitting', 'legacy', 'such', 'pop', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'who', 'own', 'previous', 'DVD', 'releases', 'little', 'reason', 'upgrade', 'new', 'bonus', 'lack', 'meat', 'warrant', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'who', 'have', 'waited', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Collection', 'should', 'mostly', 'find', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'even', 'was', 'haphazardly', 'produced']",N/A
