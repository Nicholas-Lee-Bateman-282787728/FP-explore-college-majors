I liked them because they weren't really dark or scary in any parts and they have great songs.  Anyway, glad I rented this one rather than buying it.  My 5 year old liked it but I don't want her to watch it again.  The scary zombie peas in the beginning were rediculous and too much for my 3 year old.  The story went on to be superficial, un-fun, lame attempt at humor with young adult/teenage issues that Barbie was dealing with.  The dresses are very pretty and sparkly which I think is the real attraction to the movie.

1360900,AEAWKMPKR16DS,B003RHZ66Q,Becky,"[2, 3]","What a disappointment! Now they have replaced Kelly Sheridan, all Barbie is about now is glitter, fashion, boyfriends and all that junk. Also, they are into modern technology with iphones and stuff like that.I was so upset watching this film as I have grown up with the original stories which completely touched me, the girls were ROLE MODELS and believed in themselves, it was never about how they looked or what they had on. Nor did they worry about guy's breaking up with them, catty and nasty girls or anything like that. Whenever they had enemies in the stories I knowed and loved it was never over-done and they weren't being evil because of boyfriends, guys or just superficial junk.This was NOT a fairytale, which was misleading. It's not like Swan Lake or Rapunzel which are REAL fairytales, this is completely PLASTIC, SHALLOW and materialistic.The graphics were completely overdone as well. Especially the catwalk scene with all that glitter being thrown all over the dress. The whole 'glitter' theme throughout the movie was overdone. Overall I found the graphics too much. Also, the whole 'break-up' thing with Barbie and Ken was really inappropriate for a childrens film.None of the characters were likable AT ALL. And what was with the whole 'fashion fairies' 'flaries' idea?! What a disgrace! The real fairies I want to see are like Elena in Fairytopia, a kind, brave and inspirational girl, not ones that dress up clothes and have annoying voices and toss glitter on clothes!They even tried to toss Ken in with all the glitter and fashion garbage with dressing him up on the catwalk. And what was with that kiss?! Bit too much for a kids film! They never had quite passionate kisses in the Barbie films I grew up with.I was also very angry they decided to say that the 'Barbie' in this film was an 'actress'. which made it very 'Hollywood'. The scene where she is acting is also ridiculous and not funny at all. My Mum and my whole family cringed at how stupid that scene was. Also, they decided to say that this 'Barbie' acted in 'A Mermaid Tale' and all the other Barbie films. Which really infuriated me as it really ruined the magic of the other films.I'm very sad and angry at Mattel at the new road they are taking for Barbie, which is a materialistic Barbie with a new appearance, new voice and just obsessed with the stuff that doesn't REALLY matter.If I ever have kids, I'm never letting them see this. They will be seeing the real stories which I grew up with and loved and still do. The girls with spirit and love and the 'natural' graphics.I don't think young girls should be seeing this personally. If your girl is into the modern world, not the stuff pre-2008, then let them see this. But if you are like me and an adult who grew up with 'Rapunzel' 'Swan Lake' and the other stories, you won't like this and be very disappointed with the new road Mattel are taking.I don't know why they are making Barbie like this?! I can tolerate the new Barbie look and voice (I still miss Kelly Sheridan terribly) if they make the stories have good morals and tone down the graphics and have stuff that isn't to do with glitter and fashion. Even if isn't like 'Swan Lake' or have ballet themes, just something like the Island Princess or Fairytopia.Sorry for the rant!",1,What the heck was this?!,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,3286,"['What', 'disappointment', 'Now', 'have', 'replaced', 'Kelly', 'Sheridan', 'Barbie', 'about', 'now', 'glitter', 'fashion', 'boyfriends', 'junk', 'Also', 'are', 'modern', 'technology', 'iphones', 'stuff', 'that.I', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'watching', 'film', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'original', 'stories', 'completely', 'touched', 'girls', 'were', 'ROLE', 'MODELS', 'believed', 'was', 'never', 'how', 'looked', 'what', 'had', 'did', 'worry', 'guy', 'breaking', 'up', 'catty', 'nasty', 'girls', 'anything', 'Whenever', 'had', 'enemies', 'stories', 'knowed', 'loved', 'was', 'never', 'over-done', 'were', ""n't"", 'being', 'evil', 'boyfriends', 'guys', 'just', 'superficial', 'junk.This', 'was', 'NOT', 'fairytale', 'was', 'misleading', 'not', 'like', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'Rapunzel', 'are', 'REAL', 'fairytales', 'completely', 'PLASTIC', 'SHALLOW', 'materialistic.The', 'graphics', 'were', 'completely', 'overdone', 'as', 'well', 'Especially', 'catwalk', 'scene', 'glitter', 'being', 'thrown', 'dress', 'whole', ""'glitter"", 'theme', 'movie', 'was', 'overdone', 'Overall', 'found', 'graphics', 'too', 'much', 'Also', 'whole', ""'break-up"", 'thing', 'Barbie', 'Ken', 'was', 'really', 'inappropriate', 'childrens', 'film.None', 'characters', 'were', 'likable', 'AT', 'ALL', 'what', 'was', 'whole', ""'fashion"", 'fairies', ""'flaries"", 'idea', 'What', 'disgrace', 'real', 'fairies', 'want', 'see', 'are', 'Elena', 'Fairytopia', 'kind', 'brave', 'inspirational', 'girl', 'not', 'ones', 'dress', 'up', 'clothes', 'have', 'annoying', 'voices', 'toss', 'glitter', 'clothes', 'even', 'tried', 'toss', 'Ken', 'glitter', 'fashion', 'garbage', 'dressing', 'up', 'catwalk', 'what', 'was', 'kiss', 'Bit', 'too', 'much', 'kids', 'film', 'never', 'had', 'quite', 'passionate', 'kisses', 'Barbie', 'films', 'grew', 'up', 'with.I', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'angry', 'decided', 'say', ""'Barbie"", 'film', 'was', ""'actress"", 'made', 'very', ""'Hollywood"", 'scene', 'where', 'acting', 'also', 'ridiculous', 'not', 'funny', 'My', 'Mum', 'whole', 'family', 'cringed', 'how', 'stupid', 'scene', 'was', 'Also', 'decided', 'say', ""'Barbie"", 'acted', 'A', 'Mermaid', 'Tale', 'other', 'Barbie', 'films', 'Which', 'really', 'infuriated', 'really', 'ruined', 'magic', 'other', 'films.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'sad', 'angry', 'Mattel', 'new', 'road', 'are', 'taking', 'Barbie', 'materialistic', 'Barbie', 'new', 'appearance', 'new', 'voice', 'just', 'obsessed', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'REALLY', 'matter.If', 'ever', 'have', 'kids', ""'m"", 'never', 'letting', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'real', 'stories', 'grew', 'up', 'loved', 'still', 'do', 'girls', 'spirit', 'love', ""'natural"", 'graphics.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'young', 'girls', 'should', 'be', 'seeing', 'personally', 'girl', 'modern', 'world', 'not', 'stuff', 'pre-2008', 'then', 'let', 'see', 'are', 'adult', 'who', 'grew', 'up', ""'Rapunzel"", ""'Swan"", 'Lake', 'other', 'stories', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'new', 'road', 'Mattel', 'are', 'taking.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'are', 'making', 'Barbie', 'can', 'tolerate', 'new', 'Barbie', 'look', 'voice', 'still', 'miss', 'Kelly', 'Sheridan', 'terribly', 'make', 'stories', 'have', 'good', 'morals', 'tone', 'down', 'graphics', 'have', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'do', 'glitter', 'fashion', 'Even', ""n't"", 'like', ""'Swan"", 'Lake', 'have', 'ballet', 'themes', 'just', 'something', 'Island', 'Princess', 'Fairytopia.Sorry', 'rant']",Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale

Whoever wrote it failed to think about it from the point of view of a little kid. The plot reads like a Gossip Girl episode (in the first few minutes, Barbie, a high school student, gets fired from her starring role in a Hollywood movie, gets trashed on a Perez Hiltonesque website, gets dumped by her boyfriend Ken over the phone, which turns out to be an evil plot hatched by some other girl, and then she goes to France to visit her fashion designer aunt...) really, what 5 year old is going to understand any of this? What was the writer thinking? What age group was she aiming for??Many scenes are spent with adults standing around talking in accents, it's a waste of time. Maybe the kids will stare at the colors on the screen but compared to all the other Barbie movies which are actually age-appropriate and engaging, this one is a dud.(Forget the kids, as an adult who lovesGossip Girland fashion even I'm not having any fun watching this.)I'll leave on a positive note. The 'flairies' are very pretty and cute but enter the movie way too late, have a very small amount of screen time and aren't utilized enough. The script should have been rewritten from their pov, it would have been much more fun.Get your kind any of the other Barbie movies before you get this one!

After the DVD shipped, I look at the reviews and I was concerned about the DVD.  Many of the reviews are spot-on, but it's not a terrible DVD.  It depends on your perspective.Yes, some of these concepts might be a little harsh for a young child.  In the first few minutes,Barbie deals with a hateful director, gets fired, finds herself trashed online, and her perpetual boyfriend, Ken, calls her to break up.  Barbie is upset and heads to Paris.1.  Many parents like Barbie over the Disney Princesses because ""she solves her own problems and doesn't have to have a prince rescue her.""  Okay, it's a DVD for children.  While there isn't a whole lot of depth, a complicated plot or believeable details, Barbie is indeed solving problems.2.  Ken gets more depth than I've ever seen.  First off, Raquel (an unknown to me) staged the breakup.  He spends much of the DVD going through mishap after mishap trying to reach Barbie and make up with her.  He gets ""snotted"" by a child on the plane and licked by a pig.  I still wouldn't call him an intellectual powerhouse, but he does seem to care about Barbie.3.  Some parents said the troubles were too mature, with Barbie getting fired and the break-up, for young children.  As I watched, this story is contrary to the all-too-perfect existence Barbie has always had.  Who would have thought Barbie would get dumped and fired, all in the same day? While I'm not complaining about the troubles, it does seem to be contrary to the entire Barbie ""fairy tale, forget reality"" franchise.4.  I definitely agree with the treatment of Teresa.  She comes across as a complete ditz.  She seems to think Ken's behavior indicates he was kidnapped by aliens.  Most of her lines are so silly they are ridiculous and that isn't in a good way.  She seems ...uh...medicated? For that matter, I didn't care for Raquel, a very flat character.5.  The whole concept of this story reminds me of the Bratz Fashion Angels DVD(or whatever it was called).  I despise the Bratz dolls and I couldn't help but make comparisons.6.  The fake French accents were horrid.  (At least I hope they were fake!) They were a ""strain on the ear"".  The competiting designers from another French fashion house were just nasty, especially with the kidnapping and torture of the fashion fairies with the ""cheap perfume"".7.

1360919,A3HREUZLLA6GY7,B003RHZ66Q,Melanie Lane,"[7, 9]","I was not looking forward to this movie, but I was (somewhat) pleasantly surprised, so I'll start with the bright side. The romance of Barbie and Ken was sweet (thought a little ridiculous. This was a big surprise, since lately, the character of Ken is made to look wimpy or altogether non-existent (although he's equally idiotic in this movie). The theme ""believe in yourself"" was a bit overdone, but it was still inspiring for little girls. ""Never give up"" would have been a better motto.The inclusion of more friends from Barbie's history...such as Grace, from the So In Style girls and Raquelle was a good twist. Barbie is portrayed as an imaginative, sweet, encouraging girl. The references to Barbie's past movies were a very nice addition, as were the evidences of her past movies and life as a real person. The speacial features were very good and included the dance video and music video from Mermaid Tale. I wish they had included the ""Get your sparkle on"", which can be viewed on youtube or fanpop. The music they used was good-particularly the music for the fashion show. Oh, and they used a rendition of ""Who let the dogs out"" and it was positively hilarious. The barrage of gallons and gallons of pink sparkles was a bit much, but that's a minor complaint.Perhaps the best part was (SPOILER) when Jaqueline apologized--and was forgiven. Now THAT was very refreshing. So much of the time we're told ""People never change! Get back at them because YOU rock!"" and it was a wonderful change.My biggest problem was most likely the slightly more sexual theme. Yes, it sounds crazy, but it's hinted at. Jaques, the pet of Aunt Millie, is enthralled by Sequin, Barbie's poodle. He watches her, gazing with his mouth open and tongue hanging out, and then he swivels around her and says ""You are my muse, my inspiration! Let me dress you, my dear."" winking and smirking all the while. In the outtakes Jacques swaggers up to a statue (remember, he's a dog) which he mistakes for Sequin. He strokes the statue's paw. ""Ooh, my dear, you look so cold. Let Jacques...warm you up,"" he growls suggestively. Later when Ken rips his pants, the camera zooms in on his backside to see his red-heart underwear...more than once. MANY outfits reveal far too much leg and cleavage.Then we come to the ""magical"" side. The flairies are some sort of ancient wizardry (although they look like immodest seven-year-olds with impossibly long legs, stilettos and cute figures) that are ""called"" or ""awakened"" by a special ""chant"". Once again, Teresa is obsessed with the extra-terestrial and/or paranormal. She reads alien magazines, and she believes Ken has been possesed by alien spirits. She yanks on his ear and orders them out of his mind. I'm sick of seeing Teresa (who is my favorite of Barbie's friends) being portrayed as either a new-age obsessive freak or just plain ditzy.So if it weren't for the slight innuendos and magic dabbling, this movie would get three stars from me. It still doesn't compare with the Island Princess, Nutcracker, Princess and the Pauper, or any of the other previous princess movies. The animation, to say the least, is somewhat lacking. It has none of the charm or elegance we've come to expect. It's a tiny bit more realistic and the scenes of Paris are pretty good, but the faces are fake and plastic-looking. The music was fabulous, but just not right for a Barbie movie. I miss Arnie Roth's beautiful songs more and more. This movie shows the downfall of Barbie movies, and it made me wince more than a few times. It's just not as fabulous as its predecessors. An improvement over Mermaid Tale, but that's about it. I hated the fact that Kelly Sheridan wasn't the voice-over. For the first time in Barbie movie history, Kelly wasn't even in the cast. Just another first...the marking of Barbie going down the drain. And while the theme may have been ""Stay true to your passion"" but the movie shows two very different ideas: ""If it's not 'In Style' then it's not worth spitting on"" and ""No matter how immodest or just plain freaky, if the fashion critics like it, it's going to the top.""Skip this one and go with one of the more classic Barbie movies.

This is no fairytale. It's a pathetic excuse for a kid's movie that is trying to be hip and modern and introducing little girls to the world of twitter, Juicy Couture and boyfriend breakups. ""A Fashion Fairytale"" is anything but. The animation was lame, the dialogue was too filled with ""hip"" phrases and ""teen terms"" to be good, and the characters leave much to be desired. And the clothes are immodest, over-glitterized pink party outfits that no one in the real world would wear.

Now she's too busy shopping for even MORE tight, low-cut, haute clothes. And while she's at it, she COULD use another micro miniskirt, couldn't she?

I purchased this as a gift for them for Sweetest Day and we watched it; as soon as Barbie opened up her mouth we were filled with disappointment.  They replaced their long standing voice-over Kelly Sheridan with someone else...which is a terrible mistake. If they don't think little kids notice that they are surely mistaken.The new voice just didn't match Barbie's personality; its very harsh and kind of airhead like, almost whiney.  If you are not familiar with the other Barbie movies, it probably wouldn't bother you, but after 18 other movies were it was refreshing for BArbie to always have the same voice, it was annoying to say the least.Another problem I had with the movie...Barbie played herself..not a character like all the other movies, this was very confusing to my daugher as well; as she feels each character is a real person.  They brought back many of the ""villians"" from previous movies (Mermaide Tale and Island Princess) to play different characters in this new movie. They had small pointless roles, however, it was much noticed by my 5 year old. ""Mommy, why is the bad lady from island princess in this movie?? I don't understand!"" Would it really have been that hard to just draw new characters? Little children remember villians, at least if they were going to do this, they could have brought back the good characters!It was also the first time we saw Barbie and Ken kiss, and it was more than once. That didn't bother me so much, but I felt it was unnecessary. It is like they are trying to make Barbie for tweens and teens and I'm sorry, but no 13-18 yr old I know sits around and watches Barbie. Its the younger girls, and I""m sorry but the younger girls liked BArbie's old voice and Princess/Fantasy fairytales. We can watch Fashion movies anywhere these days.  On a good note, we did love the music, there are 2 songs that are quite catchy we find ourselves singing constantly (Get your Sparkle On, and Life is a Fairytale).Overall, I think Mattel miss the boat on this one; while my children still loved Barbie; I felt the content was a little too old for the audience that will watch it; adult themes like lossing a job and her boyfriend breaking up with her.I hope they go back to their original writing style for the new movie this spring, A Fairy Secret, or I'm not so sure I will continue to buy these movies and have to explain them to my children.",3,Bring back the Old voice of Barbie!!!,1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,2484,"['own', 'single', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'daughters', '2', '5', 'LOVE', 'watch', 'over', 'purchased', 'gift', 'Sweetest', 'Day', 'watched', 'as', 'soon', 'Barbie', 'opened', 'up', 'mouth', 'were', 'filled', 'disappointment', 'replaced', 'long', 'standing', 'voice-over', 'Kelly', 'Sheridan', 'someone', 'else', 'terrible', 'mistake', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'little', 'kids', 'notice', 'are', 'surely', 'mistaken.The', 'new', 'voice', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'Barbie', 'personality', 'very', 'harsh', 'kind', 'airhead', 'almost', 'whiney', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'other', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', '18', 'other', 'movies', 'were', 'was', 'refreshing', 'BArbie', 'always', 'have', 'same', 'voice', 'was', 'annoying', 'say', 'least.Another', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'Barbie', 'played', 'herself..not', 'character', 'other', 'movies', 'was', 'very', 'confusing', 'daugher', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'real', 'person', 'brought', 'back', 'many', 'villians', 'previous', 'movies', 'Mermaide', 'Tale', 'Island', 'Princess', 'play', 'different', 'characters', 'new', 'movie', 'had', 'small', 'pointless', 'roles', 'however', 'was', 'much', 'noticed', '5', 'year', 'old', 'Mommy', 'why', 'bad', 'lady', 'island', 'princess', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'just', 'draw', 'new', 'characters', 'Little', 'children', 'remember', 'villians', 'least', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'back', 'good', 'characters', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Barbie', 'Ken', 'kiss', 'was', 'more', 'once', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'so', 'much', 'felt', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'Barbie', 'tweens', 'teens', ""'m"", 'sorry', '13-18', 'yr', 'old', 'know', 'sits', 'watches', 'Barbie', 'younger', 'girls', 'm', 'sorry', 'younger', 'girls', 'liked', 'BArbie', 'old', 'voice', 'Princess/Fantasy', 'fairytales', 'can', 'watch', 'Fashion', 'movies', 'anywhere', 'days', 'good', 'note', 'did', 'love', 'music', 'are', '2', 'songs', 'are', 'quite', 'catchy', 'find', 'singing', 'constantly', 'Get', 'Sparkle', 'Life', 'Fairytale', '.Overall', 'think', 'Mattel', 'miss', 'boat', 'one', 'children', 'still', 'loved', 'Barbie', 'felt', 'content', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'old', 'audience', 'will', 'watch', 'themes', 'lossing', 'job', 'boyfriend', 'breaking', 'up', 'her.I', 'hope', 'go', 'back', 'original', 'writing', 'style', 'new', 'movie', 'spring', 'A', 'Fairy', 'Secret', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'will', 'continue', 'buy', 'movies', 'have', 'explain', 'children']",Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale

We are big Barbie Fans and have enjoyed the past movies. However,this one is just so bad in so many ways. The content is very adult and not meant for young children. It deals with adult issues with heavy burdens. Ex: Getting fired, breakups, Closing business, hateful people who want nothing but to see you suffer and get hurt.It all starts off very badly from the beginning scene where Barbie is filming the classic 'The Princess and the Pea' and it turns into a horror movie, per this very obnoxious, hateful yelling director. He fires Barbie in the worst way possible. Then she gets hate mail on her computer as well as her boyfriend Ken dumping her over the phone. Yeah, but don't hold your breath yet. It gets even worse as the story progresses.I could not even watch it through the first 20 mins. The characters are so unintelligent. Theresa is just so dumb. Who says stuff like she does anyway? Aliens... Really? Come on even my 4 year old is brighter than her. The Dippy Aunt Millicent is just too unbelievable trying to find herself at her age. The Catty and unethical Jaquline is something I hope my daughter never tries to imitate as well as Delphine, a mindless twit who lets Jaquline boss her around disrespectfully and control her every move. Even the pets act up in this one with meaness, cattiness and just plain hateful behavior. The kid on the plane with Ken who is just over the top bad is just unappealing in so many ways. I found it difficult to watch this movie and felt embarrassed by the fictional characters behaving so badly. Stealing, lying, cheating and disrespect are not things I want to instill in my child.

1360932,AWNQ2PULUBHDH,B003RHZ66Q,"The Escape Artist ""G""","[4, 6]","My 5 year old LOVED this movie (hence the 2.5 star rating - 5 stars for her, 0 for me... divided in half).  But after seeing it over and over, and listening to the stale dialogue (and those ever annoying 'Flairies') it is beyond clear that this dvd is simply a marketing tool.  Of course it is, you're saying to yourself.  But, marketing the Fashion Fairytale line of Barbie dolls and putting Ken in ridiculous situations is ALL this 80-minute movie does.There is no real point to the storyline.  Barbie's screenwriters would have been smart to take a queue from the classic 50s and 60s drab-to-fab and Paris movies (ie: like Sabrina).  Past Barbie dvds might not have been great, but at least they attempted some substance - they provided enough of a story to allow the child-viewing-audience to continue that story with their dolls and other merchandise.  But not only is this movie painful to watch, but the toys in this line aren't all that great either!!Also leaving a sour note is the horrible animation.  In contrast to the classic doll looks that have been featured in past dvd movies, Barbie and her friends now look like they went through a number of botched plastic surgeries with big heads and bug-eyes. Hello, this is supposed to be Barbie! Not Bratz, or Moxie Girls, or Monster High, or any of those oddly proportioned ""older girl"" dolls.  The dolls' colorful renderings were also oddly in high contrast to the dark backgrounds (I mean, even daytime in Paris was shown as darker than it really is).  What was with that?  Did this movie just get green-lit so it could make it to store shelves and warehouses for the end-of the-year holiday season?  I'll just answer myself here, YES.Maybe I'm just traditional, maybe I'm just partial to the re-telling of (actual) fairy tales and classic stories with a Barbie twist, but 'A Fashion Fairytale' was NOT for me.  Heck, even ""Barbie in a Mermaid Tale"" was MUCH more enjoyable than this piece.  If you decide to add this movie to your collection, luckily it's reasonably priced for what it is (and for less than the dolls, to boot).

My family has the entire collection of Barbie movies and this is another fun, light-hearted installment perfectly in step with the rest of the series. Some people have complained about 'mature themes' better suited for older viewers (getting fired, being dumped over the phone, etc.), but keep in mind that such themes are not likely to strike a personal chord with younger audiences, and older viewers will find that these themes are presented in a comical manner anyway. (It helps to actually watch the whole movie rather than flick it off after five minutes and rush to write a negative review). The inclusion of Ken (a first in the Barbie movies) as a completely innocent jerk who can't seem to get a break makes for an amusing sub-plot to Barbie's adventures in Paris. And portraying Barbie's own 'real' life as an actress (rather than a character in a fictionalized adventure she's appearing in) puts an interesting new twist on the series.My initial concerns, before buying some of the more recent Barbie titles, have been the direction the series appeared to be taking toward a 'modern' perspective. Namely, the increasing infection of pop music, which has a worldly sound and is sometimes incongruous with Barbie's settings (as in Diamond Castle and Three Musketeers), and gender-reversal issues, or 'girl-power' which is really just throwing a bone to the grown-ups while brainwashing kids into following the 'PC' crowd and NOT thinking for themselves. But I'm happy to say that none of the Barbie movies so far have ever beaten anyone over the head with these 'issues', and all have maintained a thoroughly fun atmosphere.

1360936,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B003RHZ66Q,Z Hayes,"[2, 3]","I think the producers of this latest Barbie movie were not too sure about the target age group because in this story, a recently broken-up Barbie (from Ken) is shown leaving for Paris with her dog Sequin to visit her aunt Millicent. The boy-girl relationship plot seemed a bit inappropriate in a movie where the target age group is probably under 9. Throughout the movie, Ken is shown trying in vain to get to Barbie to apologize and get back with her but faces lots of silly obstacles along the way. Oh, and there's a kissing scene between Ken and Barbie in here.Then there's the plotline featuring the flairies - three glammed-up little fashionistas who play roles similar to the elves in the story of the Elves and the Shoemaker. These three flairies (they have flair but are not fairies since they do not possess wings) give budding fashion designers a much-needed boost with their 'flair' for designing clothes. I confess that I had problems with this part too - unlike other Barbie stories, the flairies plot line just did not seem as engaging as other stories like Barbie in the Mermaid Tale etc. Instead of portraying the need for trusting one's instincts and talent, the role of the flairies seemed to suggest that extra help by means of magical means was the way to go, and even though the storyline moved towards its ultimate 'trust your talent' message, I felt it was a bit too late for that.I felt letdown by this latest flick in the Barbie series of animated features - a shallow plot, and too much focus on romance detracted from any positive messages the movie wanted to convey.",3,A lackluster Barbie movie - shallow plot and too much focus on boy-girl relationships,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,1594,"['think', 'producers', 'latest', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'target', 'age', 'group', 'story', 'recently', 'broken-up', 'Barbie', 'Ken', 'shown', 'leaving', 'Paris', 'dog', 'Sequin', 'visit', 'aunt', 'Millicent', 'boy-girl', 'relationship', 'plot', 'seemed', 'bit', 'inappropriate', 'movie', 'where', 'target', 'age', 'group', 'probably', '9', 'movie', 'Ken', 'shown', 'trying', 'vain', 'get', 'Barbie', 'apologize', 'get', 'back', 'lots', 'silly', 'obstacles', 'way', 'Oh', 'kissing', 'scene', 'Ken', 'Barbie', 'here.Then', 'plotline', 'featuring', 'flairies', 'three', 'glammed-up', 'little', 'fashionistas', 'who', 'play', 'roles', 'similar', 'elves', 'story', 'Elves', 'Shoemaker', 'three', 'flairies', 'have', 'flair', 'are', 'not', 'fairies', 'do', 'not', 'possess', 'wings', 'give', 'budding', 'fashion', 'designers', 'much-needed', 'boost', ""'flair"", 'designing', 'clothes', 'confess', 'had', 'problems', 'part', 'too', 'other', 'Barbie', 'stories', 'flairies', 'plot', 'line', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'as', 'engaging', 'other', 'stories', 'Barbie', 'Mermaid', 'Tale', 'etc', 'Instead', 'portraying', 'need', 'trusting', 'one', 'instincts', 'talent', 'role', 'flairies', 'seemed', 'suggest', 'extra', 'help', 'means', 'magical', 'means', 'was', 'way', 'go', 'even', 'storyline', 'moved', 'towards', 'ultimate', 'talent', 'message', 'felt', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'late', 'that.I', 'felt', 'letdown', 'latest', 'flick', 'Barbie', 'series', 'animated', 'features', 'shallow', 'plot', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'romance', 'detracted', 'positive', 'messages', 'movie', 'wanted', 'convey']",Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale
