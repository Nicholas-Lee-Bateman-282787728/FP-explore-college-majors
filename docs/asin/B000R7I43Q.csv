1080245,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B000R7I43Q,a,"[5, 5]","This review covers the packaging only for the Charmed complete series set.  I am not reviewing the series itself.  I was hesitant to buy this because I had read an online review stating that discs were arriving scratched or covered in glue, and even a few Amazon reviews stated this.  Nevertheless, it was my wife's number-one Christmas gift, and I decided to take the risk.  I am glad that I did.I personally inspected each and every disc on Christmas night, and I found only two that had the tiniest bit of glue.  Using a regular DVD washer, found for about ten dollars at Best Buy, I cleaned both discs and the glue came off immediately.  Thus far, every disc plays perfectly.I don't doubt that some people have defective sets, but I wanted to state that, having ordered it from Amazon, it arrived in great condition.  That said, the box itself is a bit clunky and I'm troubled that there is no clasp so that it tends to open on the shelf unless wedged between two comparable DVD sets.  Still, it's a nifty little prop replica and really thrilled my wife, a dedicated Charmed fan.For those considering upgrading, all that this set includes exclusively is a single bonus disc and, of course, interesting packaging.  Since I did not own any of the season sets previously, this was a smart buy.  Not sure how smart it would be, however, for someone who already owns part or all of the series.",5,Not all sets arrive damaged.,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,1392,"['review', 'packaging', 'only', 'Charmed', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'am', 'not', 'reviewing', 'series', 'was', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'had', 'read', 'online', 'review', 'stating', 'discs', 'were', 'arriving', 'scratched', 'covered', 'glue', 'even', 'few', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'stated', 'Nevertheless', 'was', 'wife', 'number-one', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'decided', 'take', 'risk', 'am', 'glad', 'did.I', 'personally', 'inspected', 'disc', 'Christmas', 'night', 'found', 'only', 'two', 'had', 'tiniest', 'bit', 'glue', 'Using', 'regular', 'DVD', 'washer', 'found', 'about', 'ten', 'dollars', 'Best', 'Buy', 'cleaned', 'discs', 'glue', 'came', 'off', 'immediately', 'Thus', 'far', 'disc', 'perfectly.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'people', 'have', 'defective', 'sets', 'wanted', 'state', 'having', 'ordered', 'Amazon', 'arrived', 'great', 'condition', 'said', 'box', 'bit', 'clunky', ""'m"", 'troubled', 'clasp', 'so', 'open', 'shelf', 'wedged', 'two', 'comparable', 'DVD', 'sets', 'Still', 'nifty', 'little', 'prop', 'replica', 'really', 'thrilled', 'wife', 'dedicated', 'Charmed', 'fan.For', 'considering', 'upgrading', 'set', 'exclusively', 'single', 'bonus', 'disc', 'course', 'interesting', 'packaging', 'did', 'not', 'own', 'season', 'previously', 'was', 'smart', 'buy', 'Not', 'sure', 'how', 'smart', 'would', 'be', 'however', 'someone', 'who', 'already', 'part', 'series']",Charmed: The Complete Series

1080247,A2AACQ8PTL28WJ,B000R7I43Q,BAC,"[0, 0]","What's the big draw???? First and foremost is the historical genius of Aaron Spelling....Did you know that his first joint production venture was Spelling-Thomas with Danny Thomas??? Then came the prolific productions with E.Duke Vincent..... Aaron Spelling and his talent and loyalty to his actors/actresses and the opportunities he continued to offer them beyond the scope of one series and/or ""one hat"" is reminicent of the great Howard Hawks as well as John Wayne. Second: Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano,Rose McGowen and Shannon Doherty all skilled actress who made the successful and ""dangerous"" metamorphosis from child actress and/or ""newbie"" to first rate adult actress, producers as well as launching numerous creative ventures. My favorite is the character ""Leo Wyatt"" brought to life by Brian Krause. Third:  Jennifer Rhodes ""Grams"" and Finola Hughes ""Patty"". Style, class..... and their careers include varied  creative projects. Fourth: the leading men: Julian McMahon, Eric Dane, Drew Fuller. Fifth: the character actors/actresses:  Billy Zane, Ron Perlman, Richard Robau, Oded Fehr, Charisma Carpenter. And last and certainly not the least:  THE STORY...estranged sisters come together in a time of familial crisis and decide over the course of time and experience to bury the hatched that kept them apart from so long and formed a close and powerful bond and fulfilled their destiny: to become the Charmed Ones..the most powerful witches to take on the Dark Side and then some. And just when you think the story must come to an end when the eldest sibling ""Pru"" makes the conscious decision to choose life for her sisters and perishes during a confrontation with an undefeatable foe...a forth sister is waiting in the wings...and the Charmed Ones are ""reconstituted"" and Piper,Phoebe, and Page find their shared destiny together-very different than that shared by Piper,Phoebe and Pru. I am captivated by Leo Wyatt, ""White Lighter"" to all of the Charmed Ones. He is an angel-in more ways than one. He waits patiently...on the periphery at first as the sisters find themselves as individuals and as family and their destiny...Leo as well transforms and grows as an individual in his capacity as angel, White Lighter, Elder, Human, loving spouse, father, brother in law, confidant and friend. No matter which ""hat"" Leo wears he is there to protect, guide, love and support. His very presence as well as his selfless acts aren't always immediately recognized. And then boom...realization...Leo is our anchor. I believe that we all have White Lighters reaching us in numerous ways over the course of a crisis or life time. And we too can be there for others.  A smile to a stranger, a compliment to the checker at the grocery store, rescuing an animal from death, cruelty, abandonment. A White Lighter does not have to know a person or an animal by name,face,place. We connect heart to heart, soul to soul. And this connection is reciprocal. Fire up the search engine and research the story line and contributors...be entertained...appreciate all that Charmed has to offer...and then perhaps you can appreciate the White Lighters in your life and make the decision to become a White Lighter and/or realize that you already are one.",5,"You can be a ""White Lighter""",1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,3245,"['What', 'big', 'draw', 'First', 'foremost', 'historical', 'genius', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', '.Did', 'know', 'first', 'joint', 'production', 'venture', 'was', 'Spelling-Thomas', 'Danny', 'Thomas', 'Then', 'came', 'prolific', 'productions', 'E.Duke', 'Vincent', '..', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'talent', 'loyalty', 'actors/actresses', 'opportunities', 'continued', 'offer', 'scope', 'one', 'series', 'one', 'hat', 'reminicent', 'great', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Second', 'Holly', 'Marie', 'Combs', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'Rose', 'McGowen', 'Shannon', 'Doherty', 'skilled', 'actress', 'who', 'made', 'successful', 'dangerous', 'metamorphosis', 'child', 'actress', 'newbie', 'first', 'rate', 'adult', 'actress', 'producers', 'as', 'well', 'launching', 'numerous', 'creative', 'ventures', 'favorite', 'character', 'Leo', 'Wyatt', 'brought', 'life', 'Brian', 'Krause', 'Third', 'Jennifer', 'Rhodes', 'Grams', 'Finola', 'Hughes', 'Patty', 'Style', 'class', '..', 'careers', 'include', 'varied', 'creative', 'projects', 'Fourth', 'leading', 'men', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'Drew', 'Fuller', 'Fifth', 'character', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'Richard', 'Robau', 'Oded', 'Fehr', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'STORY', 'estranged', 'sisters', 'come', 'together', 'time', 'familial', 'crisis', 'decide', 'course', 'time', 'experience', 'bury', 'hatched', 'kept', 'apart', 'so', 'long', 'formed', 'close', 'powerful', 'bond', 'fulfilled', 'destiny', 'become', 'Charmed', 'Ones..the', 'most', 'powerful', 'witches', 'take', 'Dark', 'Side', 'then', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'story', 'must', 'come', 'end', 'when', 'eldest', 'sibling', 'Pru', 'conscious', 'decision', 'choose', 'life', 'sisters', 'perishes', 'confrontation', 'undefeatable', 'foe', 'forth', 'sister', 'waiting', 'wings', 'Charmed', 'Ones', 'are', 'reconstituted', 'Piper', 'Phoebe', 'Page', 'find', 'shared', 'destiny', 'together-very', 'different', 'shared', 'Piper', 'Phoebe', 'Pru', 'am', 'captivated', 'Leo', 'Wyatt', 'White', 'Lighter', 'Charmed', 'Ones', 'angel-in', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'patiently', 'periphery', 'first', 'sisters', 'find', 'individuals', 'family', 'destiny', 'Leo', 'as', 'well', 'transforms', 'grows', 'individual', 'capacity', 'angel', 'White', 'Lighter', 'Elder', 'Human', 'loving', 'spouse', 'father', 'brother', 'law', 'confidant', 'friend', 'matter', 'hat', 'Leo', 'there', 'protect', 'guide', 'love', 'support', 'very', 'presence', 'as', 'well', 'selfless', 'acts', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'immediately', 'recognized', 'then', 'boom', 'realization', 'Leo', 'anchor', 'believe', 'have', 'White', 'Lighters', 'reaching', 'numerous', 'ways', 'course', 'crisis', 'life', 'time', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'there', 'others', 'smile', 'stranger', 'compliment', 'checker', 'grocery', 'store', 'rescuing', 'animal', 'death', 'cruelty', 'abandonment', 'White', 'Lighter', 'not', 'have', 'know', 'person', 'animal', 'name', 'face', 'place', 'connect', 'heart', 'heart', 'soul', 'soul', 'connection', 'reciprocal', 'Fire', 'search', 'engine', 'research', 'story', 'line', 'contributors', 'be', 'entertained', 'appreciate', 'Charmed', 'offer', 'then', 'perhaps', 'can', 'appreciate', 'White', 'Lighters', 'life', 'make', 'decision', 'become', 'White', 'Lighter', 'and/or', 'realize', 'already', 'are', 'one']",Charmed: The Complete Series

The bonus features included are a must-watch for any Charmed fan. I especially enjoyed the history of the Book of Shadows and the unaired pilot. (Can you IMAGINE anyone other than Alyssa Milano playing Phoebe???)I want to spend time on this box set - it's AMAZING. One of the most creative ways I've seen a series packaged. The &#34;Book&#34; is a great way to display the CDs and keep them altogether. I also like the way the stories are laid out, each episode described. The prop book is really cool. The cover is the worn-looking, heavy green binding with the Power of Three symbol, raised imprint on the front. The pages have clearly been manufactured (in other words, not the old-world paper, hand-inked) - but it doesn't take away from the campy fun. The reproduction pages are detailed and the artwork adds to the folklore and stories. There are 2 ribbon placeholders that you can slide into your favorite pages/episodes for quick reference.If you plan to purchase all seasons, I strongly suggest you splurge and buy all at once. The price is reasonable - slightly cheaper than if you buy individual seasons over time. This would be a FANTASTIC gift if someone in your life loves the series. And if they haven't seen it, know the storyline would be loved by anyone that enjoyed supernatural shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, or Supernatural.Very well done box set.

Was I wrong! Granted the episodes with Shannen Doherty were good, but when Rose McGowan showed up I got really hooked. The character development is awesome.

The Limited Deluxe Edition box set is to the actual scale size of the Book of Shadows on the Charmed set. So you ask yourself what makes the limited deluxe boxset so different than the smaller version so I will tell you...The size is A LOT bigger, the quality of the pictures are better (thicker paper and better pictures), and the dvd holders are better (deluxe edition has round squishy holders to hold in the dvds whereas the regular version has slits in the paper which scratches the disks when you take them out). There is one downfall with the sets...deluxe edition has some scratches on the disks and the regular version has glue on the disks. So far I haven't had any problems with any of my disks.Also you can't forget the bonus disk that comes with the complete series that you cannot get anywhere else. It includes quite a few extras including the pilot episode of Charmed where Pheobe isn't played by Alyssa Milano. This is an excellent bonus disk and a great addition to the dvd set.Charmed Storyline: Prue, Piper, and Phoebe are sisters who live together. Phoebe finds The Book of Shadows in their attic and then they find out they are powerful witches...The Charmed Ones. Together they fight evil everyday while trying to have a somewhat ""normal"" life. Later on down the road they also find out that they have a baby half sister named Paige who is also a witch/white lighter. Watch to find out more.Charmed if FULL of non stop action and demon killing.

I am assuming that anyone who has bought this edition or is thinking about it already knows what a marvelous show this was to have succeeded eight years on the air. anyone investing this kind of money knows this. There fore I decided to review the presentation of this most unusual and incredible packaging, etc... Read on:I absolutely love this deluxe limited edition. Worth every penny. I repeat, Anyone who has invested this much money to purchase this copy already knows that the series is fabulous. I want to talk about the presentation of the book of shadows edition. I saw the much smaller one in a store. It was half the size and quite frankly disappointing looking. Plus I heard that there was a problem with glue getting on the discs. This GORGEOUS edition is just that gorgeous. It's just like owning your own Book of Shadows.Beautifully and artistically rendered. I was an art major in college and am very critical about art in general. I was so impressed when I opened up this very heavy package I received in the mail that I knew what it was right away, as I get a lot of packages in general. This lovely rendering of The Book of Shadows does not disappoint. Whomever put this together should be very proud of themselves whether it be one person or a collaboration.I was honestly sorry that I didn't buy a few books. When the descriptions came out for the two different versions they were the same and there was no way of telling what the differences were. One just had to take a gamble and I decided I best go with the more expensive one hoping that I wasn't making a mistake. Thrilled that I made the right choice I highly recommend any charmed fan or even a new watcher of the series to just not waste time and get this edition right off thebat. You won't in anyway be sorry.The only thing I feel they could have done better was the packaging of the book itself. I feel that it should have had a cover on the box itself for protection. It's not too late for the manufacturer to make covers and offer them for a couple bucks. I bet they would fly right outof the warehouse as I cannot be the only person that feels this way.Something so beautiful really should be better protected.Also, a small thing but nonetheless nice would have been if they had added a few more ribbon page dividers. All in all I couldn't be happier that I chose the full size authentic rendering of Charmed's ""Book of Shadows"" disc set. I'm just altogether THRILLED in case anyone didn't catch my opinion the first time. Just kidding!This is truly a work of art worthy of displaying the artwork in the book itself. It goes without saying that the Series is the obvious reason anyone buys the seasonal collections. Yet in this particular case that Is why I chose to review the actual Book of Shadows packaging more than or at least equal to the DVD set. This reminds me of when I was a child and cared more about the wrapping paper than the gift itself. At least the principal holds up. I display mine in my living area of my home. It's as much a piece of artwork as the paintings I have hanging on my walls.A real catch if you can still find one.

During the course of its 8 year run, Charmed had lots of ups and downs, having more downs than ups unfornately. From its dark and gloomy first season to the utter fluff of the final season, Charmed is a series that transformed dramatically, and it wasn't mostly for the best. Creator Constance Burge started the series on a very high note, making the first 4 seasons brilliant television while after her exit Brad Kern turned the series into a shadow of its former self and the show lost it's edge. Between main characters leaving (Shannen Doherty's Prue) to ridiculous story developments (Nymphs, Spider demons, etc), the show's last 4 seasons were mostly poor and lacked the true depth the series once had. But whatever the case, All 8 seasons can be summed up like this:Season 1 (1998-1999)-It begins when Phoebe Halliwell moves back in with her sisters, Prue and Piper Halliwell. They are 3 normal, everyday sisters who each share a defining personality. Once Phoebe reads the words from the Book of Shadows, they become the Charmed Ones, the most powerful witches in the world. But being Charmed comes with a price when the sisters battle against a variety of warlocks and demons for the first time. But they are not alone as Inspector Andy Trudy, Prue's ex-boyfriend and partner Darryl Morris add the sisters as they struggle to learn the craft and balance they're lives.Rating: 9/10Best episode: That 70's EpisodeWorst episode: Feats of ClaySeason 2 (1999-2000)-The Halliwell sisters have been witches for a year but the warlocks and demons keep coming. Prue changes her work habits and becomes a photographer while Phoebe goes back to college. Piper has a tough decision to make when she, her new neighbor Dan and Leo are caught in a love triangle. But still, the sisters grow more dependent on each other and inner demons just as well as demonic ones plague them. They continue to learn their craft and learn more about the evil that's yet to come.Rating: 8/10Best episode: Morality BitesWorst episode: Heartbreak CitySeason 3 (2000-2001)-What starts as another usual year as witches for the Charmed Ones turns to a very dangerous one. The introduction of Cole Turner brings a new and sinister enemy for the sisters in the form of Belthazor. But what makes the situation worse is Phoebe's sudden affair with the enemy that tests the bond of the sisters and their greatest battle begins. But with dark times come happy ones when Piper and Leo finally have wedded bliss. But with stronger enemies, the sisters' prefect their craft but will it be enough for them to beat the arsenal of attacks from the Triad and the Source?Rating: 9.5/10Best episode: All Hell Breaks LooseWorst episode: Magic HourSeason 4 (2001-2002)-The eldest sister has fallen, but Piper and Phoebe are not alone. Long lost sister Paige Matthews is reunited with her sisters and revives the Charmed Ones. But the Source is not happy and his plans against the sisters are more life threatening than ever. Can they teach Paige the craft in time? Can they create the bond they had with Prue? But more importantly, with the help of Cole/Belthazor as their greatest ally now, Can they defeat evil's most powerful force, the Source, for good?Rating: 10/10Best episode: Charmed and DangerousWorst episode: Enter the DemonSeason 5 (2002-2003)-The Source may be gone, but the Charmed Ones continue their destiny on a high note with the pregnancy of Piper.

1080281,AUOIOJ1CSPO99,B000R7I43Q,Matt B.,"[3, 3]","When I really think about it, I realize what a good show Charmed really is. There are times when I think about certain episodes or the acting or special effects, and I'm not sure if it was supposed to be campy, or to be taken seriously as a drama. Maybe it was a dramedy. I'm not sure as of now. I should probably watch it again before I write this review but oh well. There are also times when I think back to episodes and they struck a chord with me. Many episodes were dark, intense, brutal, exciting, magical, and sometimes even a little scary. These were the best kinds of Charmed episodes. People will say that the later seasons were too cheesy and not serious, and I agree that the eighth season was only meant for people who were desperate for more Charmed, but even seasons 5, 6 and 7 had it's good shows. No matter what the episode was like, I think the idea behind it was that it was to be a fun time. Maybe it wasn't the best of TV but it was fun and entertaining. Charmed had so many high highs and low lows that it feels like a full show. A show that has experience and made use of its impressive run. When I tell someone I like Charmed they will laugh and say ""hahahaha THAT show???"" but they just see the cheesy, girl power side to it. They never see the creative and smart side to it which is really what made it cool. I think it should have ended after its 7th season, but since episode one, it's been a fun popcorn show that verges on silliness but embraces the dark and action-packed stuff people like. I'd say, catch it on TNT more than a few times, and then decide if its good enough for you to buy the DVD. It definitely aint for everyone (I'm surprised I ever watched it!) but I would recommend it to you personally because it really overall is an excellent show with great production values, not to mention the glorious shots of the California skies at the beginning of every episode.8.3/10",4,A good show that you're not always sure you should take seriously.,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,1915,"['When', 'really', 'think', 'realize', 'what', 'good', 'show', 'Charmed', 'really', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'think', 'certain', 'episodes', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'campy', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'drama', 'Maybe', 'was', 'dramedy', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'now', 'should', 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'write', 'review', 'oh', 'well', 'are', 'also', 'times', 'when', 'think', 'back', 'episodes', 'struck', 'chord', 'Many', 'episodes', 'were', 'dark', 'intense', 'brutal', 'exciting', 'magical', 'sometimes', 'even', 'little', 'scary', 'were', 'best', 'kinds', 'Charmed', 'episodes', 'People', 'will', 'say', 'later', 'seasons', 'were', 'too', 'cheesy', 'not', 'serious', 'agree', 'eighth', 'season', 'was', 'only', 'meant', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'desperate', 'more', 'Charmed', 'even', 'seasons', '5', '6', '7', 'had', 'good', 'shows', 'matter', 'what', 'episode', 'was', 'think', 'idea', 'was', 'was', 'be', 'fun', 'time', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'TV', 'was', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'Charmed', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'high', 'highs', 'low', 'lows', 'full', 'show', 'show', 'experience', 'made', 'use', 'impressive', 'run', 'When', 'tell', 'someone', 'like', 'Charmed', 'will', 'laugh', 'say', 'hahahaha', 'THAT', 'show', 'just', 'see', 'cheesy', 'girl', 'power', 'side', 'never', 'see', 'creative', 'smart', 'side', 'really', 'what', 'made', 'cool', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'ended', '7th', 'season', 'episode', 'one', 'been', 'fun', 'popcorn', 'show', 'silliness', 'dark', 'action-packed', 'stuff', 'people', ""'d"", 'say', 'catch', 'TNT', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'then', 'decide', 'good', 'enough', 'buy', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'aint', 'everyone', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'ever', 'watched', 'would', 'recommend', 'personally', 'really', 'overall', 'excellent', 'show', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'not', 'mention', 'glorious', 'shots', 'California', 'skies', 'beginning', 'episode.8.3/10']",Charmed: The Complete Series

Shows combining everyday life and something supernatural, which I think is an awesome and very entertaining combination. For those who don't know what this is all about, it follows three witch sisters living in San Fransisco. They have three different powers (bring time to a standstill, see the future and move objects using only the mind), but (almost) no one except them know they have these powers or know they are witches. They have to use these powers to deal with everything from demons to more regular stuff. You can probably imagine how entertaining it is.

1080283,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B000R7I43Q,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 5]","How did this show manage to stay on the air for so long? It's horrible. It's a show that takes the worse moments from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and throws it into a world of ""The Craft"". 3 Sisters find out one day they are witches and must become super heroes to save the day.The acting is so cringe worthy. Shannon Daugherty was bad enough as an almost emotionless actor in Beverly Hills 90210, and she managed to play the exact same character in this. Just change the name around, but if Jason Priestly had have shown up on set playing her brother, I doubt any 90210 fans would have felt anything but happiness.Alyssa Milano... yeah, guess why she was cast? An attempt to lure male viewers perhaps? Didn't work in the end. But she seems to be the only one who could do a half decent job of acting in this thing.Then there is... what's her name? I don't know, nor do I care to find out... I think she plays Pippy or Piper or something? She has got to be the worst actress in Hollywood. I thought Shannon Daugherty was blunt, but man, there is a reason you have not seen this girl in anything worth a damn since this show finished. She is irritating, one dimensional, and did I mention she really can not act?So they throw these 3 together, and not one of them looks like she could be the sister of the other 2. You know, sometimes sisters tend to have the same features somewhere? Whether it be eyes, nose, hair color, eye brows, ears or something? Hmmm... not a single similarity between any of them. I know, they are actors and not really sisters... but come on, they could have cast girls who sort of look like they could be related, couldn't they?So, here is the #1 reason I can't stand this show. Because every week it seems to be the exact same thing. The girls are having some sort of problem or affair of their own, and try to rush around avoiding each other but reminding each other they are the power of 3 every chance they get. But that's when they have to come back together to fight this weeks bad guy. Of coarse, they can't figure out how to defeat the bad guy, so after consulting their own personal angel, they turn to a book of witch spells like it's something that they forgot existed until one remembers? Then they look through it for a vanquishing spell, which is never the same spell as last weeks, they lure a demon or something into their home, gather around the book and slowly say some stupid poem about how they are the power of 3 and they are compelling the demons, in a dull, boring, monotone voice, and then go have a happy go lucky cookie binge when the demon leaves in a puff of smoke.Later on someone else replaces Daugherty, and she fits right into the house by reminding everyone that the power of 3 is this, and the power of 3 is that, and the power of 3 is blah, blah, blah.... if it wasn't annoying enough already at how many times they remind you they are the power of 3, they then go and open a bar called P3!!... guess what it stands for? Hearing them constantly say that made me wanna pull my hair out while my wife had this garbage playing every day, episode by episode, season by season. It reminded me why I saw a handful of episodes back in 1998 or whenever it started and never cared to watch it again.I can't imagine anyone but girls into fantasy and probably want to be witches themselves would be into this show. Possibly also men not on the straight path too, but I will be surprised if any straight men watch this! This show was irritating, repetitive, and never seemed to go anywhere. Everything was always the same... one of the girls is away, only the power of 3 girls chanting some boring dull line can send Freddy back to Springwood, so you wait 15 more mins till the end of the show when the 3rd one finally gets there and reads from a book to vanquish an evil spirit sent from the seasons villain to try and get the charmed ones out of the way so he can not be stopped opening up another Star Bucks in the city.And they have the nerve to charge over $100 for this?

Very very nice!The dvd's (as everyone has stated) do slide in and out of cardboard. Each time you pull one out or put it back in you get this SINKING feeling that you're damaging the discs somehow. I pulled a few out to look at them and I have to admit some of them did NOT look good. There were scratches or some sort of small speckled substance on them. I decided to put one of the WORST looking ones in the dvd player (or bluray player in my case) just to see what would happen before I attempted to clean it. I was SURE that there would be problems playing this because the disc looked terrible. Guess what? I watched the entire thing and there were no problems playing it. I was kind of shocked. I suspect that some folks DVD players are able to read discs better than other dvd players. I really do NOT feel like going through ALL of these discs right at the moment, but I will have to do it soon before time runs out.The transfers for both video and audio quality are great as I expected. From what I've seen so far, there is no music deletion from the show (which surprises me). This show would always start with a song while we got to see VERY COOL aerial shots of San Francisco leading up to the first act after the epilogue. Like I said, from what I've watched so far, it's all there. One thing that I don't like is I noticed that there is no ""play all"" feature! What I mean by that is on the disc I'm watching now, there are FOUR episodes. You simply choose which episode you want to watch. If you start with the first one, once it ends the next episode should play, right? It doesn't. It goes back to the menu and you have to manually choose the next episode. For the life of me I can't figure out why some dvd releases allow you to do an ""episode selection"" or just ""play all"" while others just allow the episode selection only. I suppose if your DVD player has a ""repeat entire disc"" function that it will play the entire disc on its own, but most dvd players I've used only allow to repeat title or chapter and not entire disc.It's too bad they couldn't have used softer materials that hold the dvd's themselves while leaving the book material the same.",4,"Unbelievable quality for the BOOK, but the DVD storage makes me nervous!",1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,2287,"['Love', 'show', 'got', 'steal', '49.00', 'hope', 'book', 'fantastic', 'NOT', 'have', 'cheap', 'feel', 'Very', 'very', 'nice', 'dvd', 'everyone', 'stated', 'do', 'slide', 'cardboard', 'time', 'pull', 'one', 'put', 'back', 'get', 'SINKING', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'damaging', 'discs', 'somehow', 'pulled', 'few', 'look', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'NOT', 'look', 'good', 'were', 'scratches', 'sort', 'small', 'speckled', 'substance', 'decided', 'put', 'one', 'WORST', 'looking', 'ones', 'dvd', 'player', 'bluray', 'player', 'case', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'attempted', 'clean', 'was', 'SURE', 'would', 'be', 'problems', 'playing', 'disc', 'looked', 'terrible', 'Guess', 'what', 'watched', 'entire', 'thing', 'were', 'problems', 'playing', 'was', 'kind', 'shocked', 'suspect', 'folks', 'DVD', 'players', 'are', 'able', 'read', 'discs', 'better', 'other', 'dvd', 'players', 'really', 'do', 'NOT', 'feel', 'going', 'ALL', 'discs', 'right', 'moment', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'soon', 'time', 'out.The', 'transfers', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'great', 'expected', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'music', 'deletion', 'show', 'show', 'would', 'always', 'start', 'song', 'got', 'see', 'VERY', 'COOL', 'aerial', 'shots', 'San', 'Francisco', 'leading', 'up', 'first', 'act', 'epilogue', 'said', 'what', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'so', 'far', 'there', 'One', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'noticed', 'play', 'feature', 'What', 'mean', 'disc', ""'m"", 'watching', 'now', 'are', 'FOUR', 'episodes', 'simply', 'choose', 'episode', 'want', 'watch', 'start', 'first', 'one', 'once', 'next', 'episode', 'should', 'play', 'right', ""n't"", 'back', 'menu', 'have', 'manually', 'choose', 'next', 'episode', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'dvd', 'allow', 'do', 'episode', 'selection', 'just', 'play', 'others', 'just', 'allow', 'episode', 'selection', 'only', 'suppose', 'DVD', 'player', 'repeat', 'entire', 'disc', 'function', 'will', 'play', 'entire', 'disc', 'own', 'most', 'dvd', 'players', ""'ve"", 'used', 'only', 'allow', 'repeat', 'title', 'chapter', 'not', 'entire', 'disc.It', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'used', 'softer', 'materials', 'hold', 'dvd', 'leaving', 'book', 'material', 'same']",Charmed: The Complete Series

1080286,A1CWV11YOHMXJ2,B000R7I43Q,Nathan L. Baker,"[1, 2]","That's the only negative comment I have about this set: that you really need to get (or make) a stand for this, perhaps a replicate version of the one used on the actual show. It's not so much a negative criticism as it is a bit of advice--the set puts other complete series sets to shame and deserves a great presentation in the entertainment room (or attic).The show itself has its ups, its downs, its in-betweens, but, generally speaking, it holds up fairly well as a show about three sisters and their whitelighter. It has plenty of camp appeal, plenty of teen appeal, plenty of 18-24 male appeal, etc. If skeptical TV watchers have shied away from this because of the fantasy element, they'd do well to realize that ""Charmed"" has a little bit of something for everything. Although I typically shy away from that sort of media, ""Charmed"" manages to avoid taking itself too seriously which is what makes it enjoyable. Watch it with mom, dad, brother, sister, cousin, grandpa, whoever.Now, the set, as I've said, is fantastic. It's about as close to the real Book of Shadows as you'd expect; actually more than expected. The individual releases are all a bit cheap and tacky looking. Slim sets, all basically looking the same except with different colors. Eh. Not interesting. In fact, that's what made me think of the show as ""cheap"", as something not worth watching.The book is in very sturdy hardback, with fairly thick pages. Best of all, many of the pages have very sharp looking reproductions of a selection of the screen-used pages. Again, they are exactly the opposite of ""cheap"". Best of all--in comparison with the regular edition of this set--the pages have little cardboard pieces for the discs; none of that sticking-DVDs-in-paper-slits stuff.There's really not much else to say about it, except that it's a shame that the set isn't widely available. If you can find a used copy of it, or perhaps a leftover copy at a Borders or other retailer, snatch it up! I found mine at a Borders towards the end of February, and was able to use a Borders Rewards coupon to bring the price down to about $230, only $60 more than the smaller edition--which isn't bad because you really get a lot more bang for your buck.",5,You'll need a stand to put this thing on...,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,2222,"['only', 'negative', 'comment', 'have', 'set', 'really', 'need', 'get', 'make', 'stand', 'perhaps', 'replicate', 'version', 'one', 'used', 'actual', 'show', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'negative', 'criticism', 'bit', 'advice', 'set', 'other', 'complete', 'series', 'sets', 'shame', 'great', 'presentation', 'entertainment', 'room', 'attic', '.The', 'show', 'ups', 'downs', 'in-betweens', 'generally', 'speaking', 'up', 'fairly', 'well', 'show', 'three', 'sisters', 'whitelighter', 'plenty', 'camp', 'appeal', 'plenty', 'teen', 'appeal', 'plenty', '18-24', 'male', 'appeal', 'etc', 'skeptical', 'TV', 'watchers', 'have', 'shied', 'away', 'fantasy', 'element', ""'d"", 'do', 'well', 'realize', 'Charmed', 'little', 'bit', 'something', 'everything', 'typically', 'shy', 'away', 'sort', 'media', 'Charmed', 'avoid', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'what', 'enjoyable', 'Watch', 'mom', 'dad', 'brother', 'sister', 'cousin', 'grandpa', 'whoever.Now', 'set', ""'ve"", 'said', 'fantastic', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'real', 'Book', 'Shadows', ""'d"", 'expect', 'actually', 'more', 'expected', 'individual', 'releases', 'are', 'bit', 'cheap', 'tacky', 'looking', 'Slim', 'sets', 'basically', 'looking', 'same', 'different', 'colors', 'Eh', 'Not', 'interesting', 'fact', 'what', 'made', 'think', 'show', 'cheap', 'something', 'not', 'worth', 'watching.The', 'book', 'very', 'sturdy', 'hardback', 'fairly', 'thick', 'pages', 'Best', 'many', 'pages', 'have', 'very', 'sharp', 'looking', 'reproductions', 'selection', 'screen-used', 'pages', 'Again', 'are', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'cheap', 'Best', 'comparison', 'regular', 'edition', 'set', 'pages', 'have', 'little', 'cardboard', 'pieces', 'discs', 'none', 'sticking-DVDs-in-paper-slits', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'say', 'shame', 'set', ""n't"", 'widely', 'available', 'can', 'find', 'used', 'copy', 'perhaps', 'leftover', 'copy', 'Borders', 'other', 'retailer', 'snatch', 'found', 'mine', 'Borders', 'end', 'February', 'was', 'able', 'use', 'Borders', 'Rewards', 'coupon', 'bring', 'price', 'down', '230', 'only', '60', 'more', 'smaller', 'edition', ""n't"", 'bad', 'really', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'bang', 'buck']",Charmed: The Complete Series

1080291,A2HRY9WK9T3RUX,B000R7I43Q,P. Gilbert,"[1, 1]","May 11 2014 -I bought all 8 seasons separately because of issues common with ""complete series"" packaging. But this seems the best place to review the entire series, rather than review each season separately.I had watched about half the series on TV when broadcast,  but thought I'd like to re-watch it end-to-end since I was able to get all 8 seasons for about $15 per season. Doing so was a bit painful at times.First, I am male, and I suspect that men and women will have substantially different reactions to the main characters.Many/most of the story *IDEAS* are pretty good, but then it is like they turned the story *WRITING* over to a class of 8th graders.For the most part, I would say the seasons with Shannen Dougherty are better than the seasons after.I initially really disliked Julian McMahan as Cole, but he grew into the role and became maybe the most interesting character in the show until they wrote him out.Plenty of skin to look at throughout the series, with the girls dressing like hookers or strippers most of the time. Nice to look at, especially Rose McGowan's wonderful alabaster skin, but it was not enough to make up for the juvenile script.By far the most annoying character is Phoebe. I don't know how much that is Alyssa Milano and how much is pure Phoebe, but the character has the attention span of a knat and never seems to grow as a character, no matter how much dialog there is about her growing as a person in the script.  Season after season, they all whine about wanting a normal life. As if. And attempt after attempt to do so fails, but still there is no  change to the ""I don't have time to save the world right now because I need and deserve to be self-absorbed and self-indulgent"". They never seem to learn from the past, yet make a big deal about their ""experience"".Overall, I am frustrated that over 8 seasons there has not been any substantial evolution in the ""feel"" of the episodes.Maybe the intended audience was female ...(I just started Season 8, so there may be some closing remarks to come.)Jun 10 2014 -I finished the series and downgraded this show from 3 to 2 stars. I found, after subsequently watching 2 seasons of ""Hell On Wheels"", just how relatively bad ""Charmed"" is.

1080293,AFV2584U13XP3,B000R7I43Q,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 2]",This is another gift I got on my B-day since my family saw I liked the dresden files series they thought this would be a good addition.  What I feel the show has is pretty decent but the stories you got per episode or the storyline for one of the seasons seemed either a little childish or to light in the drama department to truly take very seriously.  The one thing I liked of the dresden files was that each episode while had some humor mostly was serious and very and sometimes darkly dramatic in each episode.  The charmed series it seemed tried to make some dramatic episodes and while all are not bad most seemed to make the drama to lightly or put to many boring cliche jokes or magical mishaps to truly take what was happening to the characters seriously.  True there were some some sad episodes like the death of Prue after season three which I find a bit ironic since it seemed in each season after words that one of the sisters would always die and than be brought back again the same episode(I know the actress who played Prue was either fired or quit so that is why she never came back to the show).  The series all in all is not bad or great but in between which I call adequate so I say buy the first episode check it out and see if you're willing to get the rest of the series..,4,Light-Hearted Magical Series But No True Hard-Core Drama,1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,1295,"['gift', 'got', 'B-day', 'family', 'saw', 'liked', 'dresden', 'files', 'series', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'addition', 'What', 'feel', 'show', 'pretty', 'decent', 'stories', 'got', 'episode', 'storyline', 'one', 'seasons', 'seemed', 'little', 'childish', 'light', 'drama', 'department', 'truly', 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'one', 'thing', 'liked', 'dresden', 'files', 'was', 'episode', 'had', 'humor', 'mostly', 'was', 'serious', 'very', 'sometimes', 'darkly', 'dramatic', 'episode', 'charmed', 'series', 'seemed', 'tried', 'make', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'most', 'seemed', 'make', 'drama', 'lightly', 'put', 'many', 'boring', 'cliche', 'jokes', 'magical', 'mishaps', 'truly', 'take', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'characters', 'seriously', 'True', 'were', 'sad', 'episodes', 'death', 'Prue', 'season', 'three', 'find', 'bit', 'ironic', 'seemed', 'season', 'words', 'one', 'sisters', 'would', 'always', 'die', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'again', 'same', 'episode', 'know', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Prue', 'was', 'either', 'fired', 'quit', 'so', 'why', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'show', 'series', 'not', 'bad', 'great', 'call', 'adequate', 'say', 'buy', 'first', 'episode', 'check', 'out', 'see', ""'re"", 'willing', 'get', 'rest', 'series..']",Charmed: The Complete Series

I tried on 5 separate DVD players and most of the discs were simply unusable. Returned for a refund.VERY poor mass-produced product.

1080304,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B000R7I43Q,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","On the surface, Charmed looks to be just another WB teen show. After all, the cast is loaded with former teen idols. Looks however can be deceiving! Charmed is a very solid mix of comedy and science fiction that leaves the fan craving more. I could sit and watch episodes of this show for hours!Three sisters reunite for the funeral of the grandmother that raised them. After the funeral, they are going through the house and find a lot of things that lead them to believe their grandmother was into witch craft. After being attacked, investigating more, and being visited by some ghosts, the sisters learn that they are the decedents of a very powerful family of magicians. They are in fact legendary witches known as the charmed ones, who for thousands of years have been prophesized as the ones who finally tip the balance between good and evil to our side!The show starts with them learning about their powers and ends with them trying to fulfill their destinies. Holly Marie Combes plays older sister Piper and while never the big name star of the show, she is by far the most interesting and entertaining character. Eventually the show comes to center around her and her family within the show. Personally, I think this is what saved the show after the early departure of one of its stars.Charmed is eight seasons of magic, action, comedy, love, tragedy, and just plain fun. Being that it has a cast of all former teen idols, with low rating, on what is nowhere near a major network, the show didn't get the recognition that it deserved, but it is a terrific show! You can currently catch re-runs early mornings on TNT and of course watch it online.

Zero special features on the season 1-7 sets was always aggravating to fans considering the show has such a strong following who were hoping for some extras on the DVD's.  It was a nice treat for the final season to get some good special features, however we still were hoping for more.  Now, with the release of the series set, fans get the DVD release that they long deserved.  This series set is beautiful and one that fans will be happy with.  The packaging is amazing by itself, a replica of the Book of Shadows that has been a staple of the series.  Not only is the over of the packaging resembling the book, but the interior as well with artwork from the book seen in the series used as pages in the set.  Along with seasons 1-8, fans also get treated to an additional bonus disc to make up for the lack of features in seasons 1-7.  This bonus disc has some nice featurettes, the best one is 'The Power of Three' which interviews the cast and crew about the dinamic of the sisters and how it made the show the success it was.  It's nice to see some new interviews with Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano and Rose McGowan as well as series show-runner Brad Kern.Overall, I give this series set an 'A.'
