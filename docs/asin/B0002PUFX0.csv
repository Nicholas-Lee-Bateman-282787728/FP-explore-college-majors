842820,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B0002PUFX0,David Bower,"[3, 3]","An engineer from Houston, Texas has moved back to his hometown in Millwood, California and taken a job as the city engineer. Although the family misses Houston they try to adjust to life in a small town with a much slower pace. The move has resulted in a reduction in income which compels the engineer's wife, played by Gabrielle Carteris, to get a job well below her normal pay grade.Their adjustment to the town is interrupted by a series of unexpected fires that seem unrelated but of very suspicious origins. Scott Daniels, the city engineer from Houston, played by Joe Lando begins to suspect that the fire's origins may be something out of the ordinary and begins to try and pin down a cause. Opposition to Daniels' investigation comes unexpectedly from an unlikely source, the fire chief.It is up to Daniels to discover what's causing the problem and find a solution while facing opposition to his every move by the fire chief; the safety of the town will ultimately depend upon his success.This is a well paced made for TV movie with adequate acting, scenery, picture, and sound; any fan of disaster flicks should find this one entertaining.",3,Better Than Average Low Budget Disaster Flick,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,1149,"['engineer', 'Houston', 'Texas', 'moved', 'back', 'hometown', 'Millwood', 'California', 'taken', 'job', 'city', 'engineer', 'family', 'Houston', 'try', 'adjust', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'much', 'slower', 'pace', 'move', 'resulted', 'reduction', 'income', 'engineer', 'wife', 'played', 'Gabrielle', 'Carteris', 'get', 'job', 'well', 'normal', 'pay', 'grade.Their', 'adjustment', 'town', 'interrupted', 'series', 'unexpected', 'fires', 'seem', 'unrelated', 'very', 'suspicious', 'origins', 'Scott', 'Daniels', 'city', 'engineer', 'Houston', 'played', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'suspect', 'fire', 'origins', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'ordinary', 'try', 'pin', 'down', 'cause', 'Opposition', 'Daniels', 'investigation', 'unexpectedly', 'unlikely', 'source', 'fire', 'chief.It', 'up', 'Daniels', 'discover', 'what', 'causing', 'problem', 'find', 'solution', 'facing', 'opposition', 'move', 'fire', 'chief', 'safety', 'town', 'will', 'ultimately', 'depend', 'success.This', 'well', 'paced', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'adequate', 'acting', 'scenery', 'picture', 'sound', 'fan', 'disaster', 'flicks', 'should', 'find', 'one', 'entertaining']",N/A

842822,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0002PUFX0,Michael Butts,"[6, 8]","Hampered by sophomoric special effects, a limp script and an uninspired cast, COMBUSTION is a disappointment.  Joe Lando (Dr. Quinn) stars as a city engineer who believes deadly gases are somehow being released into the city's underground sewer system, resulting in deadly fires and deaths.  Greeted with skepticism by the egotistical fire chief (Michael Gregory, overacting shamefully), Lando must convince the mayor and everyone that he is right.  Of course, a greedy oil baron (Michael Gross, looking woefully embarrassed) is the one responsible for the gas releases, but he doesn't want Lando to uncover this.  A subplot involves Lando's troubled marriage to Gabrielle Carteris and their son's involvement with the daughter of Lando's old flame, who is now a newscaster(Susan Walters).  Directed with little regard for common sense or pacing, COMBUSTION fizzles instead of sizzles.",2,NO HEAT IN THIS ONE,1116892800,"05 24, 2005",2005,885,"['Hampered', 'sophomoric', 'special', 'effects', 'limp', 'script', 'uninspired', 'cast', 'COMBUSTION', 'disappointment', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'city', 'engineer', 'who', 'deadly', 'gases', 'are', 'somehow', 'being', 'released', 'city', 'underground', 'sewer', 'system', 'resulting', 'deadly', 'fires', 'deaths', 'Greeted', 'skepticism', 'egotistical', 'fire', 'chief', 'Michael', 'Gregory', 'overacting', 'shamefully', 'Lando', 'must', 'convince', 'mayor', 'everyone', 'right', 'course', 'greedy', 'oil', 'baron', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'looking', 'woefully', 'embarrassed', 'one', 'responsible', 'gas', ""n't"", 'want', 'Lando', 'uncover', 'subplot', 'Lando', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'Gabrielle', 'Carteris', 'son', 'involvement', 'daughter', 'Lando', 'old', 'flame', 'who', 'now', 'newscaster', 'Susan', 'Walters', 'Directed', 'little', 'regard', 'common', 'sense', 'pacing', 'COMBUSTION', 'instead', 'sizzles']",N/A
842823,A1FSZ2GKH2THBT,B0002PUFX0,"Penni Fields ""smlchng56""","[12, 13]","I think Joe Lando (DQMW, Higher Ground) did a great job as the Chief Engineer trying to warn the (evil) Fire Chief about the gas fumes running under the city of Millwood that was highly combustible and setting businesses on fire. I liked that he was a smart man who was respected by the Mayor,his co-workers,and  other firemen and that they did not treat him like he was a crazy person. (Not to mention he is really ""hot"" in this movie which fueled the fire so-to-speak for me.) Anyway, we get small amounts of background of the trouble Scott Daniels had with a previous job working for NASA from conversations, but we can tell he has always been a good guy. The ""friendship"" between Scott and Kenny Burrows is a plus throughout this movie. They supply some of the humor so it isn't all gloom and doom. The plot of this movie came off well in my opinion, and it has a happy ending.
