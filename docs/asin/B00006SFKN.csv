I couldn't believe they were going to make a movie with the Irwins. And I didn't think it would be any good. I was wrong. I love Animal Planet's docu-series with the Croc Hunter (It's always amazed me how crazy this fella must be). The movie is filmed half in they style of Steve's tv show, and half in the style of a motion picture. By keeping the real people and the fictional character separate through most of the film, they're able to continue to give the feel of the tv show. And our heroes, Steve and Terri, stay oblivious to the plot of the film throughout. The show is full of cheeky humor (the word ham comes to mind) and cheesey action mixed in with Steve's animal action. It actually turned out to be a pretty good film. I was surprised I liked it. Plus there is all kinds of behind the scenes footage, where we get to watch Steve play with his crocs.This is a good film for the whole family (unless you're Australian, then the language might be a bit much), or a good film for anyone who likes Steve Irwin's show on Animal Planet.",4,Crikey! can you believe it,1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,1111,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Croc', 'Hunter', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'Irwins', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'wrong', 'love', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'docu-series', 'Croc', 'Hunter', 'always', 'amazed', 'how', 'crazy', 'fella', 'must', 'be', 'movie', 'filmed', 'half', 'style', 'Steve', 'tv', 'show', 'half', 'style', 'motion', 'picture', 'keeping', 'real', 'people', 'fictional', 'character', 'separate', 'most', 'film', ""'re"", 'able', 'continue', 'give', 'feel', 'tv', 'show', 'heroes', 'Steve', 'Terri', 'stay', 'oblivious', 'plot', 'film', 'show', 'full', 'cheeky', 'humor', 'word', 'ham', 'mind', 'cheesey', 'action', 'mixed', 'Steve', 'animal', 'action', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'surprised', 'liked', 'kinds', 'scenes', 'footage', 'where', 'get', 'watch', 'Steve', 'play', 'crocs.This', 'good', 'film', 'whole', 'family', ""'re"", 'Australian', 'then', 'language', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'good', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'show', 'Animal', 'Planet']",The Crocodile Hunter - Collision Course

723301,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B00006SFKN,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[1, 1]","Steve Irwin getting his own movie, crikey! (I know, that was lame) Collision Course is based off of the popular wildlife television series the Crocodile Hunter. When Collision Course was released in theaters, it did okay, but not amazing. That always confused me since he was widely known and respected but the movie didn't sit well with critics. The most frequent complaint is that the movie is pretty much just like the television show so there really is no reason for a movie. While yet it is very similar I have to disagree. While the television series is popular, releasing a movie lets many more people get educated about animals and also have some laughs as well. Another frequent complaint is that the CIA agents are unnecessary, they are, but I find them amusing and they make for a good time. One last complaint is that Steve and Terri aren't very good at acting, but you can't really criticize them too harshly, since they aren't really actors but wildlife conservationists. But, let's just ignore the critics and decide for ourselves. And since I'm not a critic, let me say that I loved this movie and if you've enjoyed Steve Irwin's work you'll definitely enjoy this movie. I was relieved that the scenes with Steve and Terri were quite similar to an episode of the Crocodile Hunter. You see, Steve is trying to relocate a crocodile before its shot by a local rancher, and two CIA agents are searching for a missing satellite beacon and they happen to run into each other for entirely different reasons. While yet this is a very unrealistic plot, it's very enjoyable. This movie really doesn't deserve a specific rating so you kind of have to decide for yourself. If you're into well made movies with a great plot and great actors this movie isn't for you, if you love wildlife, Steve Irwin and don't mind a silly plot than this is a great movie for you and I would recommend it.Not only is the movie great, but the bonus features are fantastic as well. Many of the bonus features discuss the difficulty of filming animals. Since Collision Course is scripted, the film crew needs the animal in the scene to do a specific movement for the film crew to get a shot. But many of the animals in Collision Course are deadly and cannot be trained so it's very interesting seeing the way that Steve and the film crew get the shots they needed. Collision Course also has many deleted scenes, and also included are the movie's original theatrical trailers. The rest of the bonus features aren't as interesting but decent, there is a music video featuring the Baha Men, a photo gallery, and...sigh...DVD games. Oh yes, you can also select a feature called ""pop-up croc track"", this feature lets you read information about the animals and location during the movie. There are also one or two hidden features on the DVD menus if you want to search around for them. They're interesting but very brief.Steve Irwin may be gone, but his legacy will never be forgotten and the Crocodile Hunter Collision Course is a great item to own to commemorate his unforgettable life.",5,The Crocodile Hunter - Collision Course,1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,3067,"['Steve', 'Irwin', 'getting', 'own', 'movie', 'crikey', 'know', 'was', 'lame', 'Collision', 'Course', 'based', 'popular', 'wildlife', 'television', 'series', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'When', 'Collision', 'Course', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'did', 'okay', 'not', 'amazing', 'always', 'confused', 'was', 'widely', 'known', 'respected', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'critics', 'most', 'frequent', 'complaint', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'television', 'show', 'really', 'reason', 'movie', 'yet', 'very', 'similar', 'have', 'disagree', 'television', 'series', 'popular', 'releasing', 'movie', 'many', 'more', 'people', 'get', 'educated', 'animals', 'also', 'have', 'laughs', 'well', 'frequent', 'complaint', 'CIA', 'agents', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'are', 'find', 'amusing', 'make', 'good', 'time', 'One', 'last', 'complaint', 'Steve', 'Terri', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'criticize', 'too', 'harshly', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'actors', 'wildlife', 'conservationists', 'let', 'just', 'ignore', 'critics', 'decide', ""'m"", 'not', 'critic', 'let', 'say', 'loved', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'work', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'was', 'relieved', 'scenes', 'Steve', 'Terri', 'were', 'quite', 'similar', 'episode', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'see', 'Steve', 'trying', 'relocate', 'crocodile', 'shot', 'local', 'rancher', 'two', 'CIA', 'agents', 'are', 'searching', 'missing', 'satellite', 'beacon', 'happen', 'run', 'other', 'entirely', 'different', 'reasons', 'yet', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'plot', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'specific', 'rating', 'so', 'kind', 'have', 'decide', ""'re"", 'well', 'made', 'movies', 'great', 'plot', 'great', 'actors', 'movie', ""n't"", 'love', 'wildlife', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'silly', 'plot', 'great', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'it.Not', 'only', 'movie', 'great', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'fantastic', 'well', 'Many', 'bonus', 'discuss', 'difficulty', 'filming', 'animals', 'Collision', 'Course', 'scripted', 'film', 'crew', 'animal', 'scene', 'do', 'specific', 'movement', 'film', 'crew', 'get', 'shot', 'many', 'animals', 'Collision', 'Course', 'are', 'deadly', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'trained', 'very', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'way', 'Steve', 'film', 'crew', 'get', 'shots', 'needed', 'Collision', 'Course', 'also', 'many', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'also', 'included', 'are', 'movie', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'rest', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'decent', 'music', 'video', 'featuring', 'Baha', 'Men', 'photo', 'gallery', 'sigh', 'DVD', 'games', 'Oh', 'yes', 'can', 'also', 'select', 'feature', 'called', 'pop-up', 'croc', 'track', 'feature', 'read', 'information', 'animals', 'location', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'one', 'two', 'hidden', 'features', 'DVD', 'menus', 'want', 'search', 'around', ""'re"", 'interesting', 'very', 'brief.Steve', 'Irwin', 'may', 'be', 'gone', 'legacy', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'Collision', 'Course', 'great', 'item', 'own', 'commemorate', 'unforgettable', 'life']",The Crocodile Hunter - Collision Course
723302,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00006SFKN,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[2, 3]","With the popularity of his documentaries, its probably inevitable that Hollywood would give Steve ""The Crocodile Hunter"" Irwin his own feature film. I've always enjoyed his TV show, but when I first heard about this movie I immediately thought it would be a surefire bomb. Well, when I finally got around to seeing this I was pleasantly surprised.The plot centres around a missing satellite beacon being tracked by the CIA. The only problem is that it has landed in Queensland, Australia and one of Irwin's crocs has swallowed it; in addition to trying to locate and save the croc, Steve, his wife Terri and their dog Suey find themselves up against some nasty poachers.While some may be put off by Steve's non stop gabbing, you can't help but get caught up in his enthusiasm for his work, resulting in a film that is both fun and educational (that's one word I've never used in a review before). There are also some genuine hair raising thrills and chills that make Indiana Jones look like a wimp; although a minor portion of it is obviously choreographed for entertainment value. But this is a great family film. Actually it will appeal to any age group. Keep your eyes peeled for an amusing cameo from President Dubya.",3,Crikey!

When I brought it home, my little one plunked it into the DVD player where it remained, playing over and over and over again for DAYS!  He just loves this movie!  It's just really neat how they put a documentary into a movie format, complete with a plot.  One of the best lines in the movie is ""I think the binoculars have picked up the Discovery Channel.""  Which is what one of our CIA guys says when he sees the Irwins coming down the river with a croc in their boat.  Great, great movie, full of action and adventure.  You even get to see Steve just about get his arms pulled out of their sockets by a croc.  One of the most fascinating segments is that Steve introduces you to a bird-eating spider, which is a cousin to the tarantula.  We've all been told that tarantulas are harmless to humans, but this cousin is quite venomous.  It's actually a very humourous segment too, and also quite interesting.  We bought this dvd for a child who is petrified of animals.  Who else but Steve to help him over that!  Also, I've noticed that no one has mentioned anything about the language in this film.  For the parents out there, there are about 4-5 swear words in the end, all issued by our CIA guys.  There are a couple of d-words, and one h-word, and that's it.  I'm surprised that there are any since the Irwins don't operate like that.  Still can't figure that one out.  Anyway, this is a good find, very entertaining, and something you should definitely not pass by.

The whole technique of meshing a typical Steve documentary into a hackneyed spy thriller became less and less effective as the movie went on. Steve just can't be that unassuming all the time. Though well acted, the character of Brozzie was horribly annoying throughout. We have no sympathy, regardless of what made her the way she was. No dramatic tension ever developed in the movie. We spent most of our time waiting to see the guard dogs kill and eat Ranger Sam. And he was the most likable character in the movie. When a movie just stops and shows uninteresting outtakes as its grand climax, you know it has completely fallen apart. But what did we want from the movie? Steve and Terri spend almost all their time doing their usual thing with the animals, which is why we love to watch them in the first place. In a couple instances, we got subtle reminders that Terri is built like a brick you-know-what. Yowza! Sure, I'm jealous of Steve. This is an amazingly incompetent attempt to cram a fun documentary couple into a theatrical movie. Kids will like it. Croc Hunter fans can tolerate it.

723308,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00006SFKN,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[9, 9]","Here is a movie that both adults and children can enjoy and even learn from.  To some degree, the Crocodile Hunter movie is much like the Crocodile Hunter television series--Steve and Terri personally introduce us to some of the most misunderstood, wildly beautiful animals on the planet--crocodiles, venomous snakes, monstrous spiders, etc.  The Irwins are basically in the middle of one of their typical outings into nature, rescuing an orphaned little kangaroo, getting snakes off the road and away from the danger of vehicles, and rescuing wild crocodiles who have come into too close contact with humans (actually, it is humans who have invaded crocodile territory).  Interspersed throughout all this, though, the plot of this movie is developed.  A very important little piece of spyware has been lost from an orbiting satellite over Queensland, Australia.  Two competing factions within the CIA (who would have thunk it?) dispatch agents to recover the information at any cost.  Meanwhile, a very disagreeable old woman in the Outback is trying to kill the crocodile threatening her cows; as fate would have it, this particular crocodile has swallowed the spyware the U.S. agents are after.  Luckily, the Irwins come along and rescue the crocodile before the old lady can kill him.  When they find the agents suddenly on their tail, they believe them to be poachers, and they go to great pains to ensure the safety of the long-suffering crocodile by transplanting him into another river system.  The funniest part of the movie, in my opinion, was the conclusions drawn by the CIA about Steve Irwin.  Citing the facts that Irwin had been in South America at the time of two coups, in Kenya at the time of the embassy bombing, and in East Timor soon after its civil war, they consider him to be some kind of dangerous criminal element.I hope people won't interpret the making of this movie as an attempt by Steve Irwin to go Hollywood.  The only reason the Irwins made this movie was to further increase awareness about the beauty of nature's wild creatures and to encourage any and all efforts at conservation of wildlife.  This movie especially highlighted the dangers poachers continue to present for wildlife everywhere. Any fan of the TV series will certainly enjoy this movie as much as I did, and most likely some new Crocodile Hunters fans will be brought into the fold.  This is certainly a movie parents will have no qualms about letting their children see, as it is more than appropriate for all audiences.  The animals are quite real here, and there were quite real dangers involved in making this movie.  As such, it is as educational as it is entertaining.  The ending is a little weird, but enjoyably so; it is the message and not the plot that is important here.

Unfortunately, I was drawn to this film by Steve's untimely passing.  I was hesitant to view it for two reasons.  I didn't want to dislike this film.  I also didn't want to praise this film effusely because of Steve's death.  Fortunately, this is a terrific family film.  The best part of the film is that Steve is an engagingly energetic cheerleader for wildlife.  Not only is Steve witty but he is incredibly knowledgable about the wild kingdom.  I'm not a viewer of the Discovery Channel but I was on the edge of my seat as Steve relates the lifestyles of varied creatures.  Steve's wife, Terri, makes for a fetching sidekick.  The only drawback to the film are lesser stories about the CIA trying to intercept a missing black box in the Outback and a portly female rancher trying to bag a crocodile whose been devouring her livestock.  These story threads, however, are ultimately woven into the story for a satisfying conclusion.  If you have reservations about viewing this film because it may make you sad never fear.

723310,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00006SFKN,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[3, 4]","The Crocodile Hunter is also known as Steve Irwin. He is famous for his adventures in the wild, as he captures real animals. The best part is that none of it is a computer generated image or anything of the sort. All of the animal action in this movie is real, and that's what makes it fun. The Crocodile Hunter is the animal hunter who is always happy, and always ready for the next adventure. The only difference between his television show and his movie ""The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course"" is that the movie actually has a plot. I feel that the plot killed the story a little bit. It is kind of like the ""Garfield"" movie. ""Garfield"" is about a fat, lazy cat who never seems to want to leave his home. The problem with that movie is that it has a boring plot. The beginning is good because we get a sense of Garfield's lifestyle and regular routines. The highlights of ""The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course"" are the scenes where Steve Irwin is exploring the wildlife, and doing what he does best. Once the storyline kicks in, some of the scenes are stupid a childlike. The could have made a plot similar to the television show, and still have a good adventure story. Irwin makes up for the faults in the movie, because he is always having a good time, and wants us to have a good time watching him. 80% of this movie is fun, while the other 20% could have been changed when it was written. It's a shame this movie didn't make as much money at the box office. It would have probably been better on the big screen, but I missed this one and had to watch it on video.The story is about a top secret government satellite which has blown up and brought a device that is very important into the Australian outback where it has been swallowed by a crocodile. If the device falls into the wrong hands, it could mean trouble. The CIA has two agents Bob and Vaughan to find the crocodile and get the device back. Another person is plotting to get the device. Their contact Jo has been assigned to get the device, by pretending to be helping them. They don't know how hard it'll be to find the crocodile because of two reasons. The first is the cattle farmer named Brozzie who hates crocodiles and people who go onto her land. The other reason is because of Steve Irwin and his wife Terri. They are a couple devoted to helping the animals. They believe that the government agents are really poachers who want to steal the crododile. They decide to go on a journey to the Austrilian outback, get the crocodile, take it with them, and release it far away and out of danger. The journey is not going to be easy, and the race to the crocodile is on.""The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course"" may have a lame plot and some lame acting, but it is because of Steve Irwin that makes the movie work. I'm glad that Steve Irwin and his wife are playing themseleves, and not playing people similar to them or something like that. If they ever made a sequal to this movie, they should make it more about the jungle, and something that the Irwins have to do there because of something wrong with the animals instead of throwing in the governement and lame things like that. ""The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course"" came out during the summer, and now that it is summer again, although two years later, it is the perfect family film to rent and watch anytime. It's action packed, full of fun, and should be satisfying to anybody who will give it the time of day.ENJOY!Rated PG for action violence/peril and mild language.",4,A Crocodile Hunter Adventure!,1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,3498,"['Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'also', 'known', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'famous', 'adventures', 'wild', 'real', 'animals', 'best', 'part', 'none', 'computer', 'generated', 'image', 'anything', 'sort', 'animal', 'action', 'movie', 'real', 'what', 'fun', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'animal', 'hunter', 'who', 'always', 'happy', 'always', 'ready', 'next', 'adventure', 'only', 'difference', 'television', 'show', 'movie', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'Collision', 'Course', 'movie', 'actually', 'plot', 'feel', 'plot', 'killed', 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'kind', 'Garfield', 'movie', 'Garfield', 'fat', 'lazy', 'cat', 'who', 'never', 'want', 'leave', 'home', 'problem', 'movie', 'boring', 'plot', 'beginning', 'good', 'get', 'sense', 'Garfield', 'lifestyle', 'regular', 'routines', 'highlights', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'Collision', 'Course', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'exploring', 'wildlife', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'storyline', 'kicks', 'scenes', 'are', 'stupid', 'childlike', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'plot', 'similar', 'television', 'show', 'still', 'have', 'good', 'adventure', 'story', 'Irwin', 'up', 'faults', 'movie', 'always', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'watching', '80', '%', 'movie', 'fun', 'other', '20', '%', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'when', 'was', 'written', 'shame', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'box', 'office', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'better', 'big', 'screen', 'missed', 'one', 'had', 'watch', 'video.The', 'story', 'top', 'secret', 'government', 'satellite', 'blown', 'up', 'brought', 'device', 'very', 'important', 'Australian', 'outback', 'where', 'been', 'swallowed', 'crocodile', 'device', 'wrong', 'hands', 'could', 'mean', 'trouble', 'CIA', 'two', 'agents', 'Bob', 'Vaughan', 'find', 'crocodile', 'get', 'device', 'back', 'person', 'plotting', 'get', 'device', 'contact', 'Jo', 'been', 'assigned', 'get', 'device', 'pretending', 'be', 'helping', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'hard', ""'ll"", 'be', 'find', 'crocodile', 'two', 'reasons', 'first', 'cattle', 'farmer', 'named', 'Brozzie', 'who', 'crocodiles', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'land', 'other', 'reason', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'wife', 'Terri', 'are', 'couple', 'devoted', 'helping', 'animals', 'believe', 'government', 'agents', 'are', 'really', 'poachers', 'who', 'want', 'steal', 'crododile', 'decide', 'go', 'journey', 'Austrilian', 'outback', 'get', 'crocodile', 'take', 'release', 'far', 'away', 'danger', 'journey', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'race', 'crocodile', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'Collision', 'Course', 'may', 'have', 'lame', 'plot', 'lame', 'acting', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'movie', 'work', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'wife', 'are', 'playing', 'themseleves', 'not', 'playing', 'people', 'similar', 'something', 'ever', 'made', 'sequal', 'movie', 'should', 'make', 'more', 'jungle', 'something', 'Irwins', 'have', 'do', 'there', 'something', 'wrong', 'animals', 'instead', 'throwing', 'governement', 'lame', 'things', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'Collision', 'Course', 'came', 'out', 'summer', 'now', 'summer', 'again', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'perfect', 'family', 'film', 'rent', 'watch', 'anytime', 'action', 'packed', 'full', 'fun', 'should', 'be', 'satisfying', 'anybody', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'time', 'day.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'PG', 'action', 'violence/peril', 'mild', 'language']",The Crocodile Hunter - Collision Course

This movie was FUN!!!  It was old-fashioned in that there was not sex, not TOO much violence, no cussing, no annoying special effects! This movie was action and adventure and suspense and laughter and OF COURSE Steve Irwin, who is indescribable!  Between him and Rosie the Rancher Woman who was just as indescribable as Steve, and on top of that the fact that the ever-bumbling CIA actually believed that our beloved Steve and Terry were terrorists, there was NEVER a dull moment!  This is a GREAT movie for kids, when you don't want them watching the miserable garbage that is all around us these days!  I've lent it to several different friends with children, and they ALL loved the movie!  One of the children watching is 7 years old, and was watching it for the first time while his mother was at work.  He called her up on the phone (she sits next to me, so I ""heard"" the call).  He was laughing so hard he couldn't talk!  She kept asking him what was going on and he never could answer her!  Every time he tried, he started laughing again!  His older sister finally grabbed the phone and told her that they were watching the crocodile movie, and something had just happened and the boy cracked up so badly he had to call his mother to tell her about it.  He never could stop laughing long enough to tell her what it was!  My friend couldn't wait after that to get home and see the movie herself!  They all had great fun watching it when she got home that night!  This movie is for people who still believe in innocence and imagination, and can actually ""believe"" something for a little while and not look for every ""unbelievable"" thing that stretches their tight little imaginations.  It is not for people who must have gore, violence and special effects, or who are too sophisticated!  They were not out for academy awards here; they were out for showcasing Steve and having fun in the process.

I felt like I was watching outtakes of the Crocodile Hunter. My biggest complaint:  taking a great show and trying to make it into a 90 minute movie. It comes out looking rather absurd because it tries to press this idea that somehow a crocodile in Austrailia is going to eat a intelligence satellite that has fallen from space and that the FBI is going to track the Irwins for withholding classified government information.I realize that this idea is far-fetched on purpose and only for entertainment value, but still, most of the dialogue seems spoonfed and inane. Personally I think that they should have just taken the show and made a long documentary and released it onto video.There are several positives to the movie: Steve Irwin and the extras on DVD. Steve Irwin is always fun to watch; his goofy and outlandish wisecracks and antics kept me attentive to the film. Whether he is talking about a deadly venomous spider from Austrailia, running down and trying to catch a lizard to show the audience, or trying to track down a crocodile, he is always entertaining to watch. The DVD gives you some of the extras like behind the scenes footage of the stunts from the movie, a few outtakes, as well as 10 deleted scenes that did not make it into the movie.

Steve Irwin is the Crocodile Hunter and he has as serious death wish.  This gung-ho nut will go to any length to rescue an animal most people would pay to be killed but you got to respect that.  Anyway they look to make a movie that will be hosted by the croc hunter.The deal is a spy satilite crashes, a croc eats it and now Steve wants to rescue the croc before the CIA gets a chance to kill it.I think it is sort of worth it to see this guy say ""Crickey"" when a 30 foot lizard is trying to eat him.  Thats kind of funny.  I like action comedies and just because the croc hunter is so funny I mean he is always this close to death but he always laughs it off and where I would want to shoot the animal that almost killed me but he just wants to save it and that what this movie is all about.10 to 1 this movie will be a flop but if it does make any money the producer doesn't need a big cut since its produced by none other then Bruce Willis.  Don't look for the croc hunter to become the next Detective Mclane but don't look for this movie to bomb like Hudson Hawk (if you don't know what I'm talking about type it in and you'll see the one Willis movie you never heard of but its not that bad).  Like the Hudson Hawk look for this to be mediocre and will probably open in the ten spot in the top ten.Its not that bad but its not that good.  If the kids are bugging you because they have alreay seen Lilo and Stich and Like Mike I say give it a shot.

723318,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B00006SFKN,Julian Kennedy,"[3, 4]","The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course: 5/10: Okay first lets forget the movie for a minute. I mean the film is okay if you like the Crocodile Hunter and you have no business seeing it if you don't. The DVD extras however are brilliant.For example they show, over years mind you, Steve Irwin and his misses Terri training their star crocodiles to attack a boat without eating the cast. Needless to say the training doesn't really work.So we have wonderful footage of a barely mobile Steve complete with a knee bandage almost being chomped by a couple of over sized crocs that are some naughty shielas indeed. Now all lot of this footage makes the movie proper gussied up for whatever plot point is at hand. But it is the raw footage that shows how no CGI or mechanical crocs were used. It also covers the endless training to get the crocs used to the sets and cameras.The crocs successfully, after a while, do ignore the cameras and lights but never their chief tormentor Steve. The crocs act all calm then as soon as action is shouted they go for Steve's jugular like they were starring in a Faces of Death video. The amount of work involved for such a relatively lightweight film is rather awe inspiring.The film itself is rather simple. Steve and his wife find various Australian wildlife each more deadly than the last. Wildlife tries to kill Steve. Steve yells crikey. There is also an easily ignorable plot about the CIA or something that makes Kangaroo Jack look like a Charlie Kaufman film.And a warning to impressionable baby boomers, there is a desecration of Elton John's Crocodile Rock by the Baha Men. The DVD even includes a horrible video of same in case you capture some terrorists and need them to talk quick.One last note. For no discernible reason the aspect ratio changes when Steve is on screen and when Steve is off screen. So if you're like me and A: You weren't paying enough attention before the film. B: You have a wide screen television. C: Your remote is an all in one affair that could land a Space Shuttle and has become a sentient being.

Steve was hot, the plot was not.Don't expect Academy awards for any of this nonsense and fun. But do expect to laugh out loud (LOL). The story has Steve and his wife trying to save a croc that has swallowed a top-secret piece of space junk. The CIA wants the part and the NRO wants it too. So they send agents to retrieve it. What no one knows is the croc has eaten what the government wants. The Irwins think they are saving the croc from poachers.I think what we enjoy most about Steve Irwin is his irrespressable attitude. Whether he discovers a Bird Eating Spider or a large pile of croc poo, he is elated, and shows it. ""Woo hoo, look at this mate. A big stinky pile of croc poo!"" With dialogue like this how can the rest of the movie be all that bad?One scene that made me laugh had Steve and Terry finding a baby kangaroo in the bush. Terry says the baby is cold. Steve tells us that they must get the baby warm. He goes on to tell us that the baby kangaroo is much like a human baby and they must nurse it every two hours. He is telling us this while Terry is behind him removing her shirt. I died laughing. I had no idea where this was going to end. I really don't think the Irwins intended this to play as it did, which made it all the more funny to me.

Sure, the plot is a little silly and Steve Irwin isn't the best actor, but he's real, his concern for animals is real, he does know a lot about them, and he manages to convey a good bit about that in the movie in his own inimitable and down-to-earth way. I give the film points for creativity for the way it manages to combine a nature documentary using Steve's running commentary with a little drama and a fictional plot. To this end, Steve spends much of time addressing the audience directly, just as if the film were a nature show, even when one of the ""bad guys"" pulls a gun on him!

723324,A2TBMX78M7PD5T,B00006SFKN,"Malvolio ""scott15724""","[3, 3]","Crikey! Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, here comes the irrepressible Steve Irwin in Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course.You know Steve Irwin. This is the Aussie naturalist who, as cable TV's popular Crocodile Hunter, rescues endangered critters like spitting cobras, gila monsters, monitor lizards - and of course man-eating crocodiles - from areas of human encroachment and relocates them to more appreciative settings. He has several famous shticks. My favorite is the one where he holds an extravagantly poisonous snake by the tail and cheerfully expounds on its weaponry while the creature struggles to make him a Dead Australian. Irwin's American wife, Terri, abets him in his environmentalist adventures - hauling him back into the boat when a croc tries to give him the ""death roll"", wielding the snake sack, and so on.In Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, the Irwins play themselves, which is probably a good choice. As wildlife relocators, they are called in to move a particularly large and predatory crocodile from a habitat shared by Queensland farmer Brozzie Drewett (Magda Szubanski, Mrs. Hoggett from Babe) who has been trying unsuccessfully to make a suitcase out of it. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to any of these people, the croc has swallowed up the hard disk from a downed U.S. intelligence satellite, and the CIA has dispatched some clownish operatives to get it back by any means necessary.Ever since I started seeing promos for this movie, I wondered how the filmmakers were going to find a way to wrap the infotainment-style, straight-into-the-camera Crocodile Hunter format in a fictional, action-adventure storyline. As it turns out, they didn't. The storyline, such as it is, is just a gossamer-thin excuse to move Crocodile Hunter from cable to the Big Screen. The subplots concerning the CIA pinheads and the varmint-shooting widow, and the gonzo conservationist action involving the Croc Hunter, don't manage to intersect until near the denouement - and even then they barely nod at one another in passing. In the meantime, Steve and Terri bag an impressive catch of inappropriately located animals for resettlement, including a venomous spider, a baby kangaroo, and not one but two deadly snakes - just like on their television show.So why should you pay seven or eight bucks to see on the big screen what you can see for free on Animal Planet? Well, I'm not at all sure you should. That doesn't mean that the movie isn't entertaining, though. Sure, the story, the script, and the acting are inconsequential. (Ms. Szubanski is really the only one who bothers much with line readings.) But Steve Irwin is a genuine phenomenon. It's not just that he nonchalantly pals around with deadly reptiles (though I'd like to see you try it); he brings such an infectious, giddy enthusiasm to the screen that it really energizes you. He gushes over ""beautiful"" monster crocodiles and melon-sized arachnids like they're Victoria's Secret models, and after a while he's got you thinking, ""You know, that lizard really does have kind of nice eyes."" Irwin passionately preaches conservation; but because he's such a nuclear meltdown of gleeful energy, the message doesn't come across as stuffy or smarmy. And when it comes to credibility, who're you going to believe, some Nature Conservancy stiff, or a guy in a bush suit who wrestles thousand pound reptiles for a living?On the other hand, don't watch Crocodile Hunter (T.V. or movie) thinking it's going to be educational. Irwin's commentary is primarily a stream of lurid factoids or environmentalist generalizations - peppered by cogent observations from his wife like ""This is really dangerous!"" Still, I like the effect the movie had on my four-year-old. As we were walking to the car afterward, he volunteered, ""When I grow up, I'm going to be a crocodile hunter!"" By the time he grows to a more circumspect age, I don't imagine he'll really want to be choke-slamming anacondas (geez, I hope not). But maybe he'll hang onto some of that enthusiasm for nature, and occasionally venture from the air-conditioned confines of the living room or the mall to explore a world that - if Steve Irwin has anything to say about it - will still be verdant and wild.",3,"Like the TV show, only more so.",1028160000,"08 1, 2002",2002,4248,"['Crikey', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'safe', 'go', 'back', 'water', 'here', 'irrepressible', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'Collision', 'Course.You', 'know', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'Aussie', 'naturalist', 'who', 'cable', 'TV', 'popular', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'endangered', 'critters', 'spitting', 'cobras', 'gila', 'monsters', 'monitor', 'lizards', 'course', 'man-eating', 'crocodiles', 'areas', 'human', 'encroachment', 'more', 'appreciative', 'settings', 'several', 'famous', 'shticks', 'favorite', 'one', 'where', 'extravagantly', 'poisonous', 'snake', 'tail', 'cheerfully', 'weaponry', 'creature', 'make', 'Dead', 'Australian', 'Irwin', 'American', 'wife', 'Terri', 'environmentalist', 'hauling', 'back', 'boat', 'when', 'croc', 'give', 'death', 'roll', 'wielding', 'snake', 'sack', 'so', 'on.In', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'Collision', 'Course', 'Irwins', 'play', 'probably', 'good', 'choice', 'wildlife', 'relocators', 'are', 'called', 'move', 'particularly', 'large', 'predatory', 'crocodile', 'habitat', 'shared', 'Queensland', 'farmer', 'Brozzie', 'Drewett', 'Magda', 'Szubanski', 'Mrs.', 'Hoggett', 'Babe', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'unsuccessfully', 'make', 'suitcase', 'Meanwhile', 'unbeknownst', 'people', 'croc', 'swallowed', 'up', 'hard', 'disk', 'downed', 'U.S.', 'intelligence', 'satellite', 'CIA', 'dispatched', 'clownish', 'operatives', 'get', 'back', 'means', 'started', 'seeing', 'promos', 'movie', 'wondered', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'going', 'find', 'way', 'wrap', 'infotainment-style', 'straight-into-the-camera', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'format', 'fictional', 'action-adventure', 'storyline', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'storyline', 'such', 'just', 'gossamer-thin', 'excuse', 'move', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'cable', 'Big', 'Screen', 'subplots', 'concerning', 'CIA', 'pinheads', 'varmint-shooting', 'widow', 'gonzo', 'conservationist', 'action', 'involving', 'Croc', 'Hunter', 'do', ""n't"", 'manage', 'intersect', 'denouement', 'even', 'then', 'barely', 'nod', 'one', 'passing', 'meantime', 'Steve', 'Terri', 'bag', 'impressive', 'catch', 'inappropriately', 'located', 'animals', 'resettlement', 'including', 'venomous', 'spider', 'baby', 'kangaroo', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'deadly', 'just', 'television', 'show.So', 'why', 'should', 'pay', 'seven', 'eight', 'bucks', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'free', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'should', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'though', 'Sure', 'story', 'script', 'acting', 'are', 'inconsequential', 'Ms.', 'Szubanski', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'much', 'line', 'readings', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'genuine', 'phenomenon', 'not', 'just', 'nonchalantly', 'deadly', 'reptiles', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'try', 'infectious', 'giddy', 'enthusiasm', 'screen', 'really', 'beautiful', 'monster', 'crocodiles', 'melon-sized', 'arachnids', ""'re"", 'Victoria', 'Secret', 'models', 'while', 'got', 'thinking', 'know', 'lizard', 'really', 'have', 'kind', 'nice', 'eyes', 'Irwin', 'passionately', 'conservation', 'such', 'nuclear', 'meltdown', 'gleeful', 'energy', 'message', ""n't"", 'come', 'stuffy', 'smarmy', 'when', 'credibility', 'who', ""'re"", 'going', 'believe', 'Nature', 'Conservancy', 'stiff', 'guy', 'bush', 'suit', 'who', 'thousand', 'pound', 'reptiles', 'living', 'other', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'T.V', 'movie', 'thinking', 'going', 'be', 'educational', 'Irwin', 'commentary', 'primarily', 'stream', 'lurid', 'factoids', 'environmentalist', 'generalizations', 'peppered', 'cogent', 'observations', 'wife', 'really', 'dangerous', 'Still', 'like', 'effect', 'movie', 'had', 'four-year-old', 'were', 'walking', 'car', 'afterward', 'volunteered', 'When', 'grow', 'up', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'crocodile', 'hunter', 'time', 'more', 'circumspect', 'age', 'do', ""n't"", 'imagine', ""'ll"", 'really', 'want', 'be', 'choke-slamming', 'anacondas', 'geez', 'hope', 'not', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'hang', 'enthusiasm', 'nature', 'occasionally', 'venture', 'air-conditioned', 'confines', 'living', 'room', 'mall', 'explore', 'world', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'anything', 'say', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'verdant', 'wild']",The Crocodile Hunter - Collision Course

Created around Discovery Channel sensation Steve Irwin and his wife Terri, it follows their exploits as they face dangerous creatures from across Australia.  These documentary style set-ups are genuinely entertaining, so it&#65533;s really rather a shame that someone decided to introduce a plot involving the government, crocodile hunters and an exploded satellite.The Irwins, playing themselves, are real personalities and surprisingly perhaps transfer perfectly to the big screen.  The same charisma and unstoppable daredevil activity that keeps you watching on TV is evident here, making the couple the best thing about the picture.  They appear to be mercifully aware of what makes them popular and certainly aren&#65533;t adverse to a little self-parody, as they wrestle crocodiles or &#65533;Stevo&#65533; narrates his one-on-one with the bad guy to a camera whilst ducking punches on top of a moving vehicle.  In fact, there&#65533;s something so wonderfully endearing and humorous about them that for a minute you believe you&#65533;re watching a highly entertaining documentary.For this reason it&#65533;s a shame that a ridiculous plot with a crocodile swallowing something that fell off a satellite (what exactly is never made clear) played out by some cringe-inducing acting.

Rosie is ready to make belts and purses out of the croc, but the australian version of fish & game calls the crocodile hunter to come catch & relocate the croc.  Unbeknownst to Steve, the croc has swallowed a U.S. Satellite camera and the U.S. government is on it's way to kill the croc & retrieve the spy camera.During this whole time, the crocodile hunter does not know that it is the U.S. government trying to kill the croc (besides Rosie the rancher), he things these bloats are poachers wanted to use the crocs skin for various items.  He doesn't even know what the spy camera is once the croc has pooped it out.This is a very entertaining, family oriented movie and has quite a few laughs!

It's a film that the whole family will enjoy, unless you&#8217;re biased against Steve Irwin's show.",4,Family Fun,1052352000,"05 8, 2003",2003,577,"['would', 'think', 'comic-action', 'movie', 'revolving', 'fallen', 'spy', 'satellite', 'interspersed', 'segments', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'movie', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'wrong', 'formula', 'well', 'CROCODILE', 'HUNTER', 'little', 'bit', 'something', 'everyone', 'action', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'little', 'bit', 'romance', 'guns', 'car', 'chase', 'lots', 'wild', 'animals', 'violence', 'tame', 'sex', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'foul', 'language', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'enjoy', '8217', 're', 'biased', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'show']",The Crocodile Hunter - Collision Course
