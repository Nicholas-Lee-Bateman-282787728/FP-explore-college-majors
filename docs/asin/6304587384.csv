429107,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,6304587384,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[1, 1]","If you often visit films of Satyajit Ray, you will recognize many of his actors.  The women in Ray's films are generally beautiful, while the men are with memorable character in their face.  The lead actress in Charulata was also in hisMahanagar (The Big City).  And now she plays the beautiful Charu, ignored and lonely wife, who falls deeply for her assigned mentor, who is her brother-in-law.What's unique about this love story is that there isn't the usual acknowledgement, no mutual confirmation of love, neither the display of affection.  It's rather one-sided and it is the actress who skillfully must convey to the viewer those feelings.  It is subtle but yet romantic.Set in 19th century, and released in 1964, Charula (Lonely Wife) lives behind the walls of a grand luxurious place, viewing the outside world through her opera glasses, connecting only with servants, and her husband runs a political newspaper.  He doesn't have much time for Charu, and in order to bring out her writing talent, he asks his brother to mentor her.Charulata was filmed entirely on set, with great detail to the period and details began with the Victorian bed.  A tedious process was the hanging of printed wallpaper pattern onto plywood.  Satyajit Ray was a remarkable man, a short story writer, graphic designer, and a composer.  His graphic design and musical composition talents were evident.  Music, lyrics and writing play a major role in this film.  The author referenced several times by Charu, Bankim, unknown to most in our world, was a prominent novelist of that era.This is a lengthy film, at times slow moving, but the depth is the relationship of love without infidelity.  This is said to be Satyajit Ray's favorite work.  Satyajit is a remarkable man.

Unfortunately, the sound quality of the DVD was really poor.  Full of static, and sometimes shaky. As other reviewers pointed out, the screen was often very dark, and facial details couldn't be seen clearly when they mattered. In addition, some important lines were not translated in the subtitles. Such a great film deserves to be restored by Criterion! I'll make a few more comments on the camera work, assuming that the DVD captured it accurately: the scene with Charu on the swing was interesting, with more adventurous camera work, compared with the earlier Apu trilogy and Devi. The scene with the storm, just before Amol arrived, was also done to great effect. Yet it is Ray's sense of drama and timing, and his ability to draw out the subtleties of emotions, that make his films great. I'm not convinced that the lighting was as good as it should be, although it is difficult to tell from the DVD. There were some awkward jumps, and in some shots, e.g. of shoes or feet, the timing or the framing didn't seem quite right to me.The excellent bio of Satyajit Ray by Andrew Robinson mentions several things that might be unclear to Western viewers.  The 19th century romantic novelist Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was influential at the time of the story, and he encouraged Rabindranath Tagore, whose ""Nastanirh"" was the source for the film. Before agreeing to cooperate with the bio, Ray told Robinson that he needed to learn Bengali. In his chapter on Charulata, Robinson tells of the many allusions, especially to Bankim, that are used in the dialogue of the film. As Amon is an aspiring writer, and Charu shows her ability to write, writing is a major theme of the film, and these allusions - which I can't appreciate fully - must contribute to the texture of the story. The contrast between the imaginative life of literature and the more mundane political life is comically evident when Amon tries to read a poem, and Bhupati won't let him get past the first line, with his literal quibbling. The ""man of the world"" has no chance in this contest, because both Tagore and Ray are the poetic creators of the story!I'll wait for a better DVD before viewing this film again. Ideally, the translation should be more complete, with subtitles that last long enough to be read, and supplemental material to provide more insight into the literary allusions.  Cleaning up the sound track should be easy.  I have a 55"" screen of good quality, and I would hope that a better DVD would show this film as well as it appeared in theatres.",3,Great film; poor DVD,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,2653,"['could', 'not', 'disagree', 'great', 'film', 'Moving', 'subtle', 'treatment', 'deep', 'emotions', 'great', 'acting', 'Unfortunately', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'was', 'really', 'poor', 'Full', 'static', 'sometimes', 'shaky', 'other', 'reviewers', 'pointed', 'out', 'screen', 'was', 'often', 'very', 'dark', 'facial', 'details', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'clearly', 'when', 'mattered', 'addition', 'important', 'lines', 'were', 'not', 'translated', 'subtitles', 'great', 'film', 'deserves', 'be', 'restored', 'Criterion', ""'ll"", 'make', 'few', 'more', 'comments', 'camera', 'work', 'assuming', 'DVD', 'captured', 'accurately', 'scene', 'Charu', 'swing', 'was', 'interesting', 'more', 'adventurous', 'camera', 'work', 'compared', 'earlier', 'Apu', 'trilogy', 'Devi', 'scene', 'storm', 'just', 'Amol', 'arrived', 'was', 'also', 'done', 'great', 'effect', 'Ray', 'sense', 'drama', 'timing', 'ability', 'draw', 'out', 'subtleties', 'emotions', 'make', 'films', 'great', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'lighting', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'should', 'be', 'difficult', 'tell', 'DVD', 'were', 'awkward', 'jumps', 'shots', 'e.g', 'shoes', 'feet', 'timing', 'framing', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'right', 'me.The', 'excellent', 'bio', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'Andrew', 'Robinson', 'mentions', 'several', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'unclear', 'Western', 'viewers', '19th', 'century', 'romantic', 'novelist', 'Bankim', 'Chandra', 'Chatterjee', 'was', 'influential', 'time', 'story', 'encouraged', 'Rabindranath', 'Tagore', 'Nastanirh', 'was', 'source', 'film', 'agreeing', 'cooperate', 'bio', 'Ray', 'told', 'Robinson', 'needed', 'learn', 'Bengali', 'chapter', 'Charulata', 'Robinson', 'many', 'allusions', 'especially', 'Bankim', 'are', 'used', 'dialogue', 'film', 'Amon', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'Charu', 'ability', 'write', 'writing', 'major', 'theme', 'film', 'allusions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'fully', 'must', 'contribute', 'texture', 'story', 'contrast', 'imaginative', 'life', 'literature', 'more', 'mundane', 'political', 'life', 'comically', 'evident', 'when', 'Amon', 'read', 'poem', 'Bhupati', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'first', 'line', 'literal', 'quibbling', 'man', 'world', 'chance', 'contest', 'Tagore', 'Ray', 'are', 'poetic', 'creators', 'story', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'better', 'DVD', 'viewing', 'film', 'again', 'Ideally', 'translation', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'complete', 'subtitles', 'last', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'read', 'supplemental', 'material', 'provide', 'more', 'insight', 'literary', 'allusions', 'Cleaning', 'up', 'sound', 'track', 'should', 'be', 'easy', 'have', '55', 'screen', 'good', 'quality', 'would', 'hope', 'better', 'DVD', 'would', 'show', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'appeared', 'theatres']",Charulata VHS

Whatever be the inspiration for the story, there can be no doubt that this is the closest you can get to a perfect film.Ultimately its a story of trust, betrayal and loneliness set in the 19th century. The characters consist of Bhupati-- a crusty feudal lord, with liberal views and a fascination with England and all things English.  He is distant,aloof and preoccupied with british politics and running his newspaper which like him,  is dry and unpopular. But he loves his wife dearly though has trouble expressing his love. Charulata, his wife, is imaginative, young and lonely in a loving through unexpressive marriage. And in the midst of this life comes the Bohemian brother of Bhupati- Amol, a budding author of doubtful literary credentials who comes in like a storm and catches Charulata's imagination and heart. Also coming into the mix is Charulata's evil brother who is out to embezzle Bhupati's money. What follows is a story of how love brings out the best in people, how trust and betrayal walk hand in hand, and of relationships broken and hearts that never heal.Satyajit Ray is in his elements as one unforgettable scene melts into another-- leaving behind  words not spoken, looks of smouldering passion not exchanged and tears that well up in the eyes and yet vanish with a smile....A masterpiece...a Picasso on filmWhat more can one say.....",5,Sheer magic.... the perfect film,1016064000,"03 14, 2002",2002,1505,"['Supposedly', 'inspired', 'Rabindranath', 'Tagore', 'real', 'life', 'friendship', 'Kadambari', 'Devi', 'brother', 'wife', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'best', 'work', 'be', 'inspiration', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'doubt', 'closest', 'can', 'get', 'perfect', 'film.Ultimately', 'story', 'trust', 'betrayal', 'loneliness', 'set', '19th', 'century', 'characters', 'consist', 'Bhupati', 'crusty', 'feudal', 'lord', 'liberal', 'views', 'fascination', 'England', 'things', 'English', 'distant', 'aloof', 'preoccupied', 'british', 'politics', 'running', 'newspaper', 'dry', 'unpopular', 'wife', 'dearly', 'trouble', 'expressing', 'love', 'Charulata', 'wife', 'imaginative', 'young', 'lonely', 'loving', 'unexpressive', 'marriage', 'midst', 'life', 'Bohemian', 'brother', 'Bhupati-', 'Amol', 'budding', 'author', 'doubtful', 'literary', 'credentials', 'who', 'storm', 'catches', 'Charulata', 'imagination', 'heart', 'Also', 'coming', 'mix', 'Charulata', 'evil', 'brother', 'who', 'out', 'embezzle', 'Bhupati', 'money', 'What', 'story', 'how', 'love', 'out', 'best', 'people', 'how', 'trust', 'betrayal', 'walk', 'hand', 'hand', 'relationships', 'broken', 'hearts', 'never', 'heal.Satyajit', 'Ray', 'elements', 'one', 'unforgettable', 'scene', 'melts', 'leaving', 'words', 'not', 'spoken', 'smouldering', 'passion', 'not', 'exchanged', 'tears', 'well', 'up', 'eyes', 'yet', 'vanish', 'smile', '.A', 'masterpiece', 'Picasso', 'filmWhat', 'more', 'can', 'one', 'say', '..']",Charulata VHS
429111,A20Z1PKIH0PFUF,6304587384,JoeyD,"[7, 7]","Satyajit Ray was simply one of the greatest auteurs in the history of film.  If you haven't had the privilege of seeing one of his creations, then by all means, please heed my advice.  I was first introduced to Ray's work twenty years ago in a film class I took in college.  I'm no maven in regards to his movies, having only seen five of them.  However, what I can tell you is this, all five of those films were excellent.  This one in particular is a gem and many critics believe it to be his magnum opus.""Charulata"" (The Lonely Wife) is based on the short story ""Nastanirh"" (The Broken Nest) by Pulitzer Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore (whose work I have yet the pleasure of perusing).  The story takes place in the late 19th century India and tells the tale of a lonely housewife Charu (short for Charulata), very reminiscent of Flaubert's Emma Bovary.  Charu and her rather detached, older husband Bhupati live a quiet, well-to-do life.  She is a very beautiful woman, with tons of money and all the time in the world to enjoy her passions - the arts, literature and poetry.  Yet her workaholic husband seems to be more concerned with his job than his marriage.  And alas, she is all alone, ailing from that distasteful disorder of ennui that seemingly plagues so many kept women.However, the sun shines a bit brighter for our heroine when Bhupati's young, handsome cousin Amal arrives for a visit.  Bhupati, who is far from a heartless man and feels sympathy for his wife's cheerless plight, encourages his cousin to befriend his wife as they both have so much in common (he loves poetry and the arts as well).  Well, I won't go any further in relating the story line, but as most of you can guess...I have read in several different articles that this was Ray's favorite film.  That is quite a boast when you consider how many classic, award-winning films this man had been a part of.  I just love this guy's directing!  He was an artist who was able to evoke any emotion he wanted from his actors.  There is typically not a whole lot of dialogue in his films, and he was definitely not one to use any effulgent effects, however I have never seen a director so adept in capturing the intimate feelings of his characters.  Ergo, I would be remiss to not give kudos to the fine cast as well -  Madhabi Mukherjee as Charlu, Soumitra Chatterjee as Amal, and Shailen Mukherjee as Bhupati.  All three give standout performances, especially Madhabi as Charlu and it's no wonder why Ray loved having her as his lead actress for several other films.There is no violence, foul language, nudity, crude humor, etc... in this 1964 classic.  It's a charming story directed by one of the world's greatest story tellers - simple, yet stylish and sophisticated at the same time.  I can't recommend it enough!",5,Foreign Film Fans Take Heed!

429112,A2ECPW4RA7NWMP,6304587384,John Sollami,"[4, 4]","A filmmaker has so many choices to make. What is the pace of the action? How is the scene framed? What is the best sequence of events? How is character condensed into its essence in a few brief moments of imagery? What do you do to build conflict and resolution? Satyajit Ray's Charulata has much to teach about all these questions.This film is about a highly privileged group of people living in the late 19th century in Calcutta, and a marriage where a beautiful young wife, Charulata, sits bored and alone for weeks on end while her brilliant and preoccupied husband, Bhupati, tends to his other wife: his political newspaper. Bhupati is sensitive enough to understand his wife's frustration and asks his more emotional and romantic brother, Amol, a writer of sentimental romances, to tend to his wife and help her to write. Finally we see Charulata happy, singing, playful, and tending to Amol, mending his clothes and inspiring him to continue writing. Her innocent flirtations catch her offguard as she becomes deeply attached to Amol. Amol also realizes that his emotions are leading him astray. After Bhupati is ruined when his brother in law, whom he trusted and loved, makes off with the newspaper's money, Amol decides to leave, not wanting to take away from Bhupati his ""other"" wife. Charulata is crushed by Amol's departure and inadvertently betrays her emotions to Bhupati. Bhupati is completely disillusioned by these reversals of trust and love. Their marriage is severed. The final freeze frame is of the couple reaching out to hold each other's hand and is captioned, ""The Ruined Nest.""This rather operatic plot opens slowly and quietly, but it becomes clear that a master is behind the lens as scene after scene move naturally into one another and the framing and pace draw the viewer into the emotion and drama of the story. Satyajit Ray's poetic, artistic, and literary sensibility fully enfolds and engages the viewer, and one realizes that all the right choices have been made.

Following his acclaimed ""Apu Trilogy"" Ray made films that were arguably better, though unfortunately they didn't get as much attention as the aforementioned trilogy ('Pather Panchali', 'Aparajito' and 'The World of Apu')--Charulata (1964) was one of them. It was critically acclaimed at the time, garnering Ray his second Silver Bear for Best Director at the Berlin Film Festival, and the director cites it as his favorite film--he said it was the one with the 'fewest flaws' (which is saying a LOT; Ray directed over 30 films in career spanning four decades).The story is based on a novella written by Nobel prize winning author Rabindranath Tagore called the ""Broken Nest"": set in 19th century Calcutta, when India was still under British colonial rule, it tells the story of Charu (Madhabi Mukherjee) who leads a lonely life at the start of the film--her husband's attention is fully devoted to the paper he is running, hence Charu is left performing menial duties, trapped in a lavish household. This is ingeniously shown by the director sans one word of dialog in the opening sequence: Charu flits from window to window with her opera glasses, observing mundane details of the outside world like a curious child. Ray always felt cinema was a visual medium, dialog was a secondary device, the internal conflicts of the protagonists in his films can be understood by a single close-up, glance or subtle gesture; the characters surrounding landscapes--be it a mansion as in ""The Music Room"" or the village in ""Pather Panchali"" was captured and conveyed poetically to enhance the emotions running through the characters, and in ""Charulata"" the lavish household Charu occupies is a gilded cage holding her hostage, not only physically but intellectually. All this changes when Charu's husband's cousin, Amal, comes along.Amal is a free-bird, the antithesis of Charu's husband: he is spontaneous, playful and happens to be a writer. Discovering in her wife a knack for literature, Charu's husband asks Amal to help her with her writing. During the process, their feelings for each other go beyond a mentor-student relationship. Nowadays this is where directors/writers resort to cheap sex scenes or loud confrontation to emphasize the conflict, but Satyajit Ray masterfully handles the ensuing sexual tension without resorting to gratuitous sexuality or verbosity. A famous scene in the film elaborates Charu's growing affection for Amal without a word of dialog or physical contact: Charu is on the swing, she swings back and forth while singing ""Fule Fule Dhole Dhole"" and we see a POV shot of Amal lying on the ground beside her--he is constantly swinging in and out of her view, and when she finally settles down on the swing she observes (with her opera glasses) a woman and her baby in a neighboring balcony, then she looks wistfully at Amal. We, as the audience, understand the conflict--no dialog or steamy sex scenes necessary.""Charulata"" is required viewing for any serious student of film; it's a perfect example of how to tell a story visually, and its a lesson in literary adaptation. For instance, the last scene in the film is said to be the cinematic equivalent of the ending in Tagore's original novella: after Charu's husband finds out about her wife's feelings for Amal, he wanders around aimlessly and comes back home; as they reach out for each other in the doorway, the shot is frozen mid-action and cut to individual still images (close-ups) of Charu and her husband, then cut to a medium shot of both characters, and finally a long shot with the words ""a Broken Nest"" on the screen. It's a haunting ending, with the ominous music soaring in the background--can Charu and her husband ever reconcile?A great, epic film by one of the finest director's in cinema, no less than a high-quality blu-ray release would do for ""Charulata"".",5,A hidden gem of a film!,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,3944,"['fact', 'wonderful', 'film', 'not', 'got', 'decent', 'DVD', 'release', 'comprehension', 'Following', 'acclaimed', 'Apu', 'Trilogy', 'Ray', 'made', 'films', 'were', 'arguably', 'better', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'aforementioned', 'trilogy', 'Panchali', ""'The"", 'World', 'Apu', 'Charulata', '1964', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'time', 'garnering', 'Ray', 'second', 'Silver', 'Bear', 'Best', 'Director', 'Berlin', 'Film', 'Festival', 'director', 'favorite', 'film', 'said', 'was', 'one', ""'fewest"", 'flaws', 'saying', 'LOT', 'Ray', 'directed', '30', 'films', 'career', 'spanning', 'four', 'decades', '.The', 'story', 'based', 'novella', 'written', 'Nobel', 'prize', 'winning', 'author', 'Rabindranath', 'Tagore', 'called', 'Broken', 'Nest', 'set', '19th', 'century', 'Calcutta', 'when', 'India', 'was', 'still', 'British', 'colonial', 'rule', 'story', 'Charu', 'Madhabi', 'Mukherjee', 'who', 'lonely', 'life', 'start', 'film', 'husband', 'attention', 'fully', 'devoted', 'paper', 'running', 'hence', 'Charu', 'left', 'performing', 'menial', 'duties', 'trapped', 'lavish', 'household', 'ingeniously', 'shown', 'director', 'one', 'word', 'dialog', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Charu', 'flits', 'window', 'window', 'opera', 'glasses', 'observing', 'mundane', 'details', 'outside', 'world', 'curious', 'child', 'Ray', 'always', 'felt', 'cinema', 'was', 'visual', 'medium', 'dialog', 'was', 'secondary', 'device', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'protagonists', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'understood', 'single', 'close-up', 'glance', 'subtle', 'gesture', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'landscapes', 'be', 'mansion', 'Music', 'Room', 'village', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'was', 'captured', 'conveyed', 'poetically', 'enhance', 'emotions', 'running', 'characters', 'Charulata', 'lavish', 'household', 'Charu', 'gilded', 'cage', 'holding', 'hostage', 'not', 'only', 'physically', 'intellectually', 'changes', 'when', 'Charu', 'husband', 'cousin', 'Amal', 'along.Amal', 'free-bird', 'antithesis', 'Charu', 'husband', 'spontaneous', 'playful', 'be', 'writer', 'Discovering', 'wife', 'knack', 'literature', 'Charu', 'husband', 'Amal', 'help', 'writing', 'process', 'feelings', 'other', 'go', 'mentor-student', 'relationship', 'where', 'directors/writers', 'resort', 'cheap', 'sex', 'scenes', 'loud', 'confrontation', 'emphasize', 'conflict', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'masterfully', 'ensuing', 'sexual', 'tension', 'resorting', 'gratuitous', 'sexuality', 'verbosity', 'famous', 'scene', 'film', 'Charu', 'growing', 'affection', 'Amal', 'word', 'dialog', 'physical', 'contact', 'Charu', 'swing', 'swings', 'back', 'forth', 'singing', 'Fule', 'Fule', 'Dhole', 'Dhole', 'see', 'POV', 'shot', 'Amal', 'lying', 'ground', 'constantly', 'swinging', 'view', 'when', 'finally', 'down', 'swing', 'opera', 'glasses', 'woman', 'baby', 'neighboring', 'balcony', 'then', 'wistfully', 'Amal', 'audience', 'understand', 'conflict', 'dialog', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'necessary', 'Charulata', 'required', 'viewing', 'serious', 'student', 'film', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'visually', 'lesson', 'literary', 'adaptation', 'instance', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'said', 'be', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'ending', 'Tagore', 'original', 'novella', 'Charu', 'husband', 'out', 'wife', 'feelings', 'Amal', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'back', 'home', 'reach', 'out', 'other', 'doorway', 'shot', 'frozen', 'mid-action', 'cut', 'individual', 'still', 'images', 'close-ups', 'Charu', 'husband', 'then', 'cut', 'medium', 'shot', 'characters', 'finally', 'long', 'shot', 'words', 'Broken', 'Nest', 'screen', 'haunting', 'ending', 'ominous', 'music', 'soaring', 'background', 'can', 'Charu', 'husband', 'ever', 'reconcile', 'great', 'epic', 'film', 'one', 'finest', 'director', 'cinema', 'less', 'high-quality', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'would', 'do', 'Charulata']",Charulata VHS
