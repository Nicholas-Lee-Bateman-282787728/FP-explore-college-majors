I've owned this title for 24 hours and I already am selling it back on Amazon. I honestly gave it two stars because all the men look incredibly hot (lets face it!), there's tons of T&A;, and they filmed it in ultra gorgeous Hawaii. But that's where it ends. Elementary school plays have better plot lines and scripts than this show. They couldn't even get the T&A; scenes correct. The production in its entirety is really a hot mess from beginning to end.Its sad on two fronts:1. Even though the cast aren't A-list actors, these are intelligent people. To have intelligent people do stupid plots and recite kindergarten scripts is always a crime.2. If they actually developed a plot line and good script this could've actually been a really good show. Even with all the muscles and everything else showing, there was a fantastic opportunity for this show to create something never seen on TV. They blew it to smithereens.",2,What this show could've been....,1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,1065,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'only', 'bought', 'like', 'looking', 'Reichen', 'was', 'first', 'supernatural', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'so', 'gave', 'try', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'title', '24', 'hours', 'already', 'am', 'selling', 'back', 'Amazon', 'honestly', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'men', 'look', 'incredibly', 'hot', 'face', 'tons', 'T', 'A', 'filmed', 'ultra', 'gorgeous', 'Hawaii', 'where', 'Elementary', 'school', 'plays', 'have', 'better', 'plot', 'lines', 'scripts', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'T', 'A', 'scenes', 'correct', 'production', 'entirety', 'really', 'hot', 'mess', 'beginning', 'end.Its', 'sad', 'two', 'fronts:1', 'Even', 'cast', 'are', ""n't"", 'A-list', 'actors', 'are', 'intelligent', 'people', 'have', 'intelligent', 'people', 'do', 'stupid', 'plots', 'recite', 'kindergarten', 'scripts', 'always', 'crime.2', 'actually', 'developed', 'plot', 'line', 'good', 'script', 'could', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'been', 'really', 'good', 'show', 'Even', 'muscles', 'everything', 'else', 'showing', 'was', 'fantastic', 'opportunity', 'show', 'create', 'something', 'never', 'seen', 'TV', 'blew', 'smithereens']",Dante's Cove - Season 3

Season 2 was an improvement but Season 3 moves everything forward in the right direction.The characters become more complex this season.  You have good guys dabbling with vengeance betrayal and bad guys making sacrifices for the greater good.The witches are out of the broom closet this season so the plot has moved from a ""There's something spooky going on around here"" tale to something more interesting.Tracy Scoggins and Thea Gill are faboo... especially Tracy - I really love her humorous moments and she looks stunning.The sex scenes are a little shorter.  In season 1 they went on forever and seemed random.

I looked forward to Season 3 , but found it disappointing on many levels. The addition of Jensen Atwood as Griffin is a plus and Grace (Tracy Scoggins) is given a little more depth this season. But newcomers Jenny Shimazu and (especially) Reichen Lemkuhl are awful. Poor Reichen does nothing but parade around shirtless (but never removing his Rolex) and manages to be slimy more than sexy. Jon Fleming's Adam is dumb but smokin' hot and he and Toby (Charlie David) make a better couple than Toby and Kevin (Gregory Michael). Thea Gill is just plain annoying as Diana and her character's part in the &#34;Shadows&#34; plot is needless. But the Season is saved by the storyline of Ambrosious (William Gregory Lee) and Kevin. Mr. Lee does a great job in allowing Ambrosious some softness and his unrequited love for Kevin is sweet and affecting. Mr. Michael continues to be the best Actor here - his  soft and sensitive Kevin is the perfect foil for Ambrosious and the more Kevin tries to leave &#34;Bro,&#34; the more he is drawn to him.",3,Some High Points But Has Slipped,1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,1154,"['loved', 'how', 'Season', '2', 'played', 'out', 'Kevin', 'being', 'taken', 'Ambrosious', 'Adam', 'Toby', 'having', 'serious', 'chemistry', 'looked', 'forward', 'Season', '3', 'found', 'disappointing', 'many', 'levels', 'addition', 'Jensen', 'Atwood', 'Griffin', 'plus', 'Grace', 'Tracy', 'Scoggins', 'given', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'season', 'newcomers', 'Jenny', 'Shimazu', 'especially', 'Reichen', 'Lemkuhl', 'are', 'awful', 'Poor', 'Reichen', 'nothing', 'parade', 'shirtless', 'never', 'removing', 'Rolex', 'be', 'slimy', 'more', 'sexy', 'Jon', 'Fleming', 'Adam', 'dumb', 'smokin', 'hot', 'Toby', 'Charlie', 'David', 'make', 'better', 'couple', 'Toby', 'Kevin', 'Gregory', 'Michael', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'Diana', 'character', 'part', '34', 'Shadows', '34', 'plot', 'needless', 'Season', 'saved', 'storyline', 'Ambrosious', 'William', 'Gregory', 'Lee', 'Kevin', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'great', 'job', 'allowing', 'Ambrosious', 'softness', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Kevin', 'sweet', 'affecting', 'Mr.', 'Michael', 'be', 'best', 'Actor', 'here', 'soft', 'sensitive', 'Kevin', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Ambrosious', 'more', 'Kevin', 'tries', 'leave', '34', 'Bro', '34', 'more', 'drawn']",Dante's Cove - Season 3

I admit i was a bit apprehensive when i discovered Van (Nadine Heiman) wasnt going to be in this season after her crucial role in season 2 and actually the whole series, but with the addition of the newest cast members, this season ranks as the best yet in my opinion. I was extremely pleased that Michelle Wolf (Britt) was a main cast member this season. She is awsome!! I also really enjoyed Jill Bennett taking over the role of Michelle, not that i didnt like Erin Cummings, it was the fact Jill brought a more deeper, even darker dimension to the character. I also was extremely pleased Thea Gill (Diana) returned. She takes on a greater role this season, very very well done. Despite Van not returning, the writers did come up with a clever way to explain her absence while still keeping the season opener continuing from the end of the second season. So i would definatly say that fans wont be disappointed, this season is even more sexier and darker than the two previous seasons with many surprising twists and turns leading up to a stunning finale.

watched all three seasons.I really wanted to see The Lost Pilot which as it turns out should have stayed lost.The only good thing about The Lost Pilot is that it shows the importance of proper casting.In the pilot Jill Bennett was cast as Grace sadly she could not produce the right level or type of venom needed for the part.Most of the rest of the pilot was also totally miscast.The original Toby had all the appeal of cold oatmeal and the other actors were totally wooden it was like a bad production done by a high school drama club.The saving forces of the pilot were William Gregory Lee and Gregory Michael.William Gregory Lee had the part of Ambrosius nailed at the audition.His audition was an extra feature on the pilot and he was instantly believable as the tormented Ambrosius.In Season One we were introduced to the history of Dante's Cove and we got to know the characters and their individual stories.We got to watch as Kevin and Toby struggled to build a relationship and leave their individual baggage behind while dealing with doubts and the magical mess that surrounded them.In Season Two we got to watch as their relationship struggled due to doubts,temptation and manipulation.In Season Three we watched as Kevin learned magic in an attempt to release himself from Ambrosius while he struggled with the feelings he was developing for him.We also got to watch Toby dealing with his knowledge of and dislike of Ambrosius while moving on with his life because he believed Kevin was happy.Returning in season 3 was Jill Bennett.She was wonderful in the dual role of Michelle confused innocent who was clueless to what was going on around her and the agent of malice for The House of Shadows.Over the course of 3 seasons it was wonderful to watch several of the characters grow and mature.I watched as Ambrosius was released from his prison and began stalking Kevin and professing love simply because he believed they were destined to be together.The irony was that because of his past in which he had to repress his sexuality he had no concept of what love truly is.He slowly became a man who knew that simply possessing somebody was not love and that if you truly love somebody you must give them the time and freedom to explore their own path and return to you if love is true and shared.I also enjoyed watching Grace go from being a woman/child who had been mislead, manipulated and emotionally abused to serve the needs and ideas of her mother into a fully matured woman who was finally able to see and except true love.Both She and Ambrosius were also able to see that their fight was a result of manipulation,half truths,useless grudges and a total waste of both their energies.The most interesting character change was in Adam.He went from a sexually confused trust fund kid who was hiding his pain in drugs and alcohol to a man who knew his attraction to and love for his friend Toby was worth giving up his claim to family money.He learned that nothing could ever make him as happy as sharing his life and love with Toby.",5,"Dante's Cove Seasons 1,2,3 & Lost Pilot",1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,3160,"['finally', 'gave', 'temptation',

Tracy Schoggins was just great in all three seasons.  It would be awesome to have them do a season 4 but Adam and Toby can stay in the Shadow Realm as Toby was such a goody goody.  And the soft core porn was turned down for this season as well.  but still nice too watch.,5,They tied it all up nicely,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,371,"['Was', 'good', 'see', 'characters', 'different', 'direction', 'everyone', 'ended', 'up', 'should', 'Tracy', 'Schoggins', 'was', 'just', 'great', 'three', 'seasons', 'would', 'be', 'awesome', 'have', 'do', 'season', '4', 'Adam', 'Toby', 'can', 'stay', 'Shadow', 'Realm', 'Toby', 'was', 'such', 'goody', 'goody', 'soft', 'core', 'porn', 'was', 'turned', 'down', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'nice', 'too', 'watch']",Dante's Cove - Season 3
1137019,A22TRZC8HTRSRU,B0012FA8CC,"William Alexander ""Alexander, Shaun""","[4, 6]","I borrowed these DVD sets from a friend.  He thought I might like them since he knows I was a ""Dark Shadows"" fan from a long way back and have a high appreciation for campy and cheesy ""bad"" movies and television.  But even I have my limits.Even making allowances for low budget, which I happily do, I found this show filled with nothing but the most two-dimensional rotten actors and actresses I have ever seen, not to mention the gratuitous sexuality in the ""Lair"" episodes which I found off-putting, even unconvincingly annoying. I found myself thinking that this was nothing but schlock ""A grade"" pornography.  And the attempt to create a kind of neo-gothic atmosphere is impossible when the furniture is more interesting than the dialogue.  I mean, how on earth can one make magic and vampires dull?  And again, the acting!  Ye gods.  I have been to livlier funerals.  It is pretty plain that the casting call pretty much consisted of taking off shirts, waxing, and raising eyebrows to reflect every emotion.And then I thought I was perhaps being too harsh, and might be able to enjoy some ""camp"" value if I fast-forwarded through the sex scenes.  And, just no.  It's not funny, its not ""so bad it's funny.""  It's just - bad.If you like gay porn, beefcake calendars, and Jenna Jameson physiques, ""Dante's Cove"" is for you.  Otherwise, spend some time in ""Dante's Inferno.""  It's less of a torture.No recommendation.
