Of course if any movie has dancing or singing, I'll automatically love it. :) But the lip synching was pretty obvious in most parts. And from that, it makes you wonder who exactly can REALLY sing.

The story is sooo... good and the music is awesome and it still sings in my head and heart when I thing about it just now.  Loved the cast and the people chose to tell the story.  It is and remains one of my very favorites to this day.  Such a good movie to watch with ones teenagers, parents and grandparents and also has good morals to that brings a dose of reality to the end.  I'm so happy, happy, it's now in my collection.

844504,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0002S948O,Wuchak,"[2, 2]","This 2004 TV film is based on the book ""A Mother's Gift"" written by Britney Spears and her mother. The story involves a single mother (Virginia Madsen) and her talented daughter (Lindsey Haun) who are poor, good-hearted Texans. The daughter's dream is to go to a prestigious music school in Philadelphia. The mother sacrifices everything (literally) to make it happen. There are humiliating obstacles and intense pressures. Can the daughter persevere and succeed. What about her mother?Some people wrote negative reviews just because the story was written and produced by Britney Spears and her mother. These people obviously hate Britney. Regardless, the truth is she's a talented, likable pop musician/entertainer, not to mention incredibly famous. I don't listen to her style of music and would never likely buy one of her cds or see her in concert, but who can deny this?What matters is: Is the movie any good? Yes it is. Both my wife and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. No, it may not blow you away or anything -- it is, after all, a TV movie -- but it holds your attention all the way through and it is moving; plus it throws in a couple of surprises. Even more, it has a good heart.Lindsey Haun is reminiscent of Melissa Joan Hart of ""Sabrina"" -- both likable and cute. There are quite a few other likable cast members, including Madsen. The story also features a couple of people you'll love-to-hate. And be on the lookout for the redheaded dancer played by Jessica Dawson, who's stunning, to say the least.Other than the obvious motif of fulfilling your dreams through belief and perseverance despite the obstacles, the story addresses some important sub-themes:- You'll always have an enemy who wants you to fail.- There will always be people who are willing to give you a helping hand or guidance; take advantage of these precious souls.- It's easy to take for granted the good things in your life until you meet someone who doesn't have them.- As two of Solomon's proverbs state: ""Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred"" and ""Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting with strife.""- The best way to beat an enemy is to not give up and succeed.The film was shot in Toronto, Ontario, and runs 90 minutes.GRADE: A-",5,"Dreams can come true with faith, hard work and perseverance",1231718400,"01 12, 2009",2009,2297,"['2004', 'TV', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'Mother', 'Gift', 'written', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'mother', 'story', 'single', 'mother', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'talented', 'daughter', 'Lindsey', 'Haun', 'who', 'are', 'poor', 'good-hearted', 'Texans', 'daughter', 'dream', 'go', 'prestigious', 'music', 'school', 'Philadelphia', 'mother', 'sacrifices', 'everything', 'literally', 'make', 'happen', 'are', 'humiliating', 'obstacles', 'intense', 'pressures', 'Can', 'daughter', 'persevere', 'succeed', 'What', 'mother', 'people', 'wrote', 'negative', 'reviews', 'just', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'produced', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'mother', 'people', 'obviously', 'hate', 'Britney', 'Regardless', 'truth', 'talented', 'likable', 'pop', 'musician/entertainer', 'not', 'mention', 'incredibly', 'famous', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'style', 'music', 'would', 'never', 'likely', 'buy', 'one', 'cds', 'see', 'concert', 'who', 'can', 'deny', 'What', 'movie', 'good', 'Yes', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'beginning', 'end', 'No', 'may', 'not', 'blow', 'away', 'anything', 'TV', 'movie', 'attention', 'way', 'moving', 'couple', 'surprises', 'Even', 'more', 'good', 'heart.Lindsey', 'Haun', 'reminiscent', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'Sabrina', 'likable', 'cute', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'other', 'likable', 'cast', 'members', 'including', 'Madsen', 'story', 'also', 'couple', 'people', ""'ll"", 'love-to-hate', 'be', 'lookout', 'redheaded', 'dancer', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Dawson', 'who', 'stunning', 'say', 'least.Other', 'obvious', 'motif', 'fulfilling', 'dreams', 'belief', 'perseverance', 'obstacles', 'story', 'important', 'sub-themes', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'enemy', 'who', 'fail.-', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'give', 'helping', 'hand', 'guidance', 'take', 'advantage', 'precious', 'souls.-', 'easy', 'take', 'granted', 'good', 'things', 'life', 'meet', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'them.-', 'two', 'Solomon', 'proverbs', 'state', 'Better', 'meal', 'vegetables', 'where', 'love', 'fattened', 'calf', 'hatred', 'Better', 'dry', 'crust', 'peace', 'quiet', 'house', 'full', 'feasting', 'strife', 'best', 'way', 'beat', 'enemy', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'succeed.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Toronto', 'Ontario', '90', 'minutes.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A
