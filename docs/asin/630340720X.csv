373181,A2582KMXLK2P06,630340720X,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","The Puppet Masters is quite the excellent sci-fi movie with an alien theme.This film has absolutely *zero* flaws.  It's about a group of people who investigate a sighting in the woods where aliens make a surprise landing.  From there, the storyline kicks in.It turns out these aliens are not your typical big-eyed creatures that many people associate with the word ""alien"".  Instead, these particular type of aliens are tiny stingray-looking, blood sucking creatures that attach themselves to peoples backs.  When this happens, the aliens then completely take control of the human, and to add to the suspense, their personality changes as well.It then becomes a suspenseful adventure figuring out which people contain the aliens, and who will be saved.  In order to find out, the person has to take their shirt off to reveal the alien so action can be taken.  Obviously if an alien IS controlling them, they won't take their shirt off willingly.Julie Warner was quite the attractive woman for this film.  I completely forgot about her as an actress.  She does a great job in this performance.  Donald Sutherland is an actor I never really paid a whole lot of attention to until I became a fan of his son Kiefer from the hit TV show 24.  I certainly see some similarities between Donald and his son.  Every once in a while the two of them will share similar facial expressions.Anyway, the Puppet Masters is a really good film about aliens.  In all honesty it's not a particularly scary movie- just a really good action film with the occasional startles and screams.  I highly recommend it to all alien lovers.",5,excellent,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,1608,"['Puppet', 'Masters', 'quite', 'excellent', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'alien', 'theme.This', 'film', 'absolutely', '*zero*', 'flaws', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'investigate', 'sighting', 'woods', 'where', 'aliens', 'make', 'surprise', 'landing', 'there', 'storyline', 'in.It', 'out', 'aliens', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'big-eyed', 'creatures', 'many', 'people', 'associate', 'word', 'alien', 'Instead', 'particular', 'type', 'aliens', 'are', 'tiny', 'stingray-looking', 'blood', 'sucking', 'creatures', 'attach', 'peoples', 'backs', 'When', 'aliens', 'then', 'completely', 'take', 'control', 'human', 'add', 'suspense', 'personality', 'changes', 'well.It', 'then', 'suspenseful', 'adventure', 'figuring', 'out', 'people', 'contain', 'aliens', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'saved', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'person', 'take', 'shirt', 'reveal', 'alien', 'action', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'Obviously', 'alien', 'IS', 'controlling', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'shirt', 'willingly.Julie', 'Warner', 'was', 'quite', 'attractive', 'woman', 'film', 'completely', 'forgot', 'about', 'actress', 'great', 'job', 'performance', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'actor', 'never', 'really', 'paid', 'whole', 'lot', 'attention', 'became', 'fan', 'son', 'Kiefer', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', '24', 'certainly', 'see', 'similarities', 'Donald', 'son', 'once', 'two', 'will', 'share', 'similar', 'facial', 'expressions.Anyway', 'Puppet', 'Masters', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'aliens', 'honesty', 'not', 'particularly', 'scary', 'movie-', 'just', 'really', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'occasional', 'startles', 'screams', 'highly', 'recommend', 'alien', 'lovers']",Puppet Masters VHS

Heinlein published in the early 1950s, that the film The Puppet Masters (1994) was based on, so I can't speak towards what made it into the movie and what didn't...co-written by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio (both of whom worked on films like Small Soldiers, Shrek, and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl), and David S. Goyer (Dark City, Blade, Batman Begins) and directed by Stuart Orme, the film stars Donald Sutherland (Animal House, Space Cowboys, Cold Mountain), Eric Thal (A Stranger Among Us, Six Degrees of Separation), and Julie Warner (Doc Hollywood, Tommy Boy).  Also appearing is Keith David (They Live, The Quick and the Dead), Will Patton (Armageddon, Remember the Titans), Richard Belzer (""Homicide: Life on the Street""), and Yaphet Kotto (Truck Turner, Alien).The film begins as we witness a strange phenomenon in the sky in a small, midwestern town, drawing the attention of a number of slack jawed yokels.  Shortly afterwards some gooberment people show up, namely Andrew Nivens (Sutherland), head of a secret agency called the Office of Scientific Intelligence, his son Sam Nivens (Thal), an agent of the aforementioned group, Dr. Mary Sefton, an exobiologist on loan from NASA, and some scrub agent played by Belzer.  The cursory investigation turns up some interesting things, the main thing being that people in Iowa seem especially strong and exhibit violent tendencies.  Well, it turns out some wee, flat, cartilaginous, fish-like, intelligent, parasitic aliens have come to our little corner of the universe, latching onto the backs of humans, giving them complete control over the actions of their hosts.  The trio manages to capture one of the buggers and return with it to Washington for further investigation.  The big question now seems to be exactly what do these visitors want?  Now I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd guess it would be something along the lines of planetary conquest...and sure enough, various plans come to light, one involving an attempt on `assimilating' the big cheese hisself (I'm speaking of the President of these here United States).  As Mary and her team work desperately to better understand the creatures (and uncover exploitable weaknesses), the gooberment deploys the army to contain the sinister invasion, but these efforts are in vain as the aliens seem to be multiplying at an exponential rate, eventually taking over the great metropolis that is Des Moines, Iowa...quoting a line from another film (specifically 1986 feature Aliens), ""I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit""...ultimately events occur, someone within the group is `taken', and a rescue is attempted as agents try to infiltrate the hive.  Is the human race destined to become soulless automaton hosts for mini-stingrays from outer space?  Perhaps, but would that really be so bad?  I mean think about it...how swell it would be to have something else making all your decisions for you, alleviating you of all responsibility?  Freewill is over-rated anyhow...I say acquiesce to your slimy, alien masters and enjoy the ride...As I've said, I haven't read the original source material for this film, so I can't say what was kept and what was changed, but I did enjoy this movie.  It starts quick out of the gate and maintains a brisk pace throughout, keeping its focus well.  I thought most all the performers did well and I appreciated the chemistry, especially between Thal and Warner's characters.  I will say their burgeoning relationship seemed to come on a bit quick, but given their relative appeal, it wasn't completely unbelievable that they should have the primal desire to shag each other.  I was slightly disappointed that Warner's character devolved a little as the film carried on, appearing less of a character and more of a classic, sci-fi stereotype (the female in distress needing rescuing), but she does gain some strength again near the end.  I really like Sutherland's character, a suave, no nonsense, intelligent, and pragmatic individual willing to sacrifice much in the line of duty.  Thal did well in the role of Sam, a character who seemed to get the beating about once every ten minutes throughout the film (the aliens, in controlling their hosts, also imbued them chemically with strength beyond that of normal).  If he wasn't getting slapped around or kicked in the head, he was being thrown down the stairs...he did manage to get in a few good licks, though, along with showing us the splendor of his nekkid hindquarters, which I really didn't need to see (I'm sure many a female viewer appreciated it), but whatever.  It would have been nice to see a little skin from Ms. Warner if only to offset the visual of a nekkid Eric Thal, but if you want that, you'll have to catch it in one of her other films, a feature titled Doc Hollywood (1991).  My favorite scene occurs near the end, as we see our protagonists racing to catch a helicopter, trying to stay ahead of some alien controlled hosts intent on doing them great, bodily harm...as the helicopter, which landed on a rooftop, begins to move off the roof, one doofus makes a leaping effort to grab onto the landing gear, missing it by a mile...it just seemed funny seeing this valiant effort fail miserably, as if the alien completely underestimated its hosts abilities, and paid the ultimate price.  I thought the parasitic creatures looked pretty cool, although I didn't understand why in various scenes people were asked to take their shirts off so that the unaffected humans could see if there was an alien on their backs (other than a chance to get see people without their shirts on).  Given the size of the creatures, one could have easily determined this with a simple pat down.  The biggest bone to pick for me was the ending, something another reviewer has already brought up...I don't want to give anything away, but essentially we see everyone relaxing under the belief the threat is over, but it really isn't, which results in a climatic aerial sequence.  While exciting, it felt tacked on and unnecessary, adding very little to the overall production other than an over-the-top ending.  Oh well, that's Hollywood for you...other than a few aspects, overall I thought this feature, albeit by the numbers, relatively well written and just a whole lot of fun.The picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks very sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital Surround Sound audio comes through clearly.  There are no special features included, but there are English subtitles.Cookieman108",4,"""Say goodbye to your son, Andrew.""",1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,6694,"['probably', 'worthwhile', 'mention',

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 2]","Robert Heinlein's ""Puppet Masters"" is a classic chunk of sci-fi... so inevitably it got semi-mauled by the movie industry.And the movie adaptation is sort of a half-and-half affair. Stuart Orme manages to maintain an intelligent, genuinely creepy atmosphere throughout the first half of the movie, only to spend the second half gleefully throwing in lots of gun battles, chases and really atrocious acting by Eric Thal.Government agency head Andrew Nivens (Donald Sutherland), his agent son Sam (Thal) and NASA exobiologist Mary Sefton (Julie Warner) arrive in a small Iowa town to investigate a UFO hoax.But they soon learn that it's no hoax -- the town has been infected by body-snatching alien manta rays (which would make an awesome band name), and they accidentally bring one back to Washington. The aliens are spreading through Iowa and Washington, they're strong nd smart, and there's almost no way of getting one off without the host dying.And to make matters worse, Sam is even briefly infected with one, which almost leads to the president being possessed. With only a matter of days before the entire Earth is overrun, Our Hero leads a special military team to.... rescue his love interest. Oh yeah, and maybe save the world while they're at it, if he stumbles across the solution.""The Puppet Masters"" is a true classic -- it spawned ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" ""The Faculty"" and even a ""Star Trek"" episode. It's a pretty intelligent look at the societal changes that might come from alien parasites, and ""The Puppet Masters"" sticks to that for quite some time.In fact, the first two-thirds of the movie are a pretty faithful adaptation of Heinlein's novel, with plenty of haunting suspense and scientific exploration. It's an atmosphere where nobody can be trusted, and anyone who attempts to stop the aliens will become their new slaves. There are some truly harrowing glimpses of what the aliens do to people, and creepy moments galore (such as the ""Do you miss me?"" message from a posessed chimp).Unfortunately about halfway through, Stuart Orme decides to throw in a cliche damsel-in-distress story, with the required gun battles and airborne wrestling matches. And it's riddled with fairly obvious plot-holes (why don't people go shirtless to show they're not possessed?) that leave you wondering how such stupid people got into uber-powerful government agencies.And the cast is a very mixed bag -- Donald Sutherland is simply brilliant as Niven, exuding a sort of stern paternal feel, while being willing to do whatever it takes to save the world. We never find out why his son loathes him, though. Warner does a decent job despite being nothing more than the Required Love Interest for the main character, and Keith Warner is quite good as Sam's military sidekick.Eric Thal is a total disappointment, though. His acting is embarrassingly bad in any scene that requires major emotion -- which he usually conveys by twitching and opening his mouth.

373187,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,630340720X,Get What We Give,"[6, 7]","The Puppet Masters is one of those films that most people will pass over, thinking it is similar to those murderous &quot;puppet&quot; movies made by one of those straight to video companies.I'll admit that I watched this film not because I was aching to see it but because it had an interesting sounding premise for a sci-fi film - one that seemed very familiar.  I'm not a huge sci-fi buff, but I'll give them their due when warranted.I do like Donald Sutherland.  He has truly been a venerable screen actor.In this film, Sutherland plays a government operative charged with discovering the truth about an possible UFO landing in Iowa.  Joining him is his secret service-like son, played very well by Eric Thal.  Rounding out their investigative group is a NASA scientist played by Julie Warner.  Thal and Warner are both very attractive and athletic looking.  Thal has the looks of a fashion model and the body of a tri-athlete.  When he peels off his shirt you can see every sinuey muscle in his chest and abdomen.  This is not a guy that I would want to have to go up against.  And that fact plays out as he and the team are forced to face a formidable foe in the aliens who have landed.The Puppet Masters is supposedly the source material for the Invasion of the Body Snatchers films.  Written by Robert Heinlien, the book (I've not read it) is supposedly very similar to this movie, but not to the Body Snatcher movies.The aliens in this film don't envelope the humans as in the early films and then replicate them.  They are parasitic and take over their human host's minds.This movie has many exciting moments and will have you on the edge of your seat quite often.  I found it refreshingly simplistic in its approach - lacking the early films' attempt to maintain Heinlien's supposed inferences to the McCarthyism of the 1950's.  Instead, I saw a pure sci-fi film that really was believable but for one key point.  Richard Belzer becomes infected with an alien and then has it removed.  He goes through severe withdrawals when the creature is removed and ends up committing suicide.  Subsequent removals of aliens from victims do not result in withdrawals Belzer experienced and certainly do not result in suicides.  In fact, the freed victims seem to have a strong resolve to them.  You might write this off to a stronger resolve than Belzer's character, except that he is a government agent who should have such a strong resolve.That one point aside, the movie does maintain as much continuity as can be shown and maintains its &quot;believability.&quot;No - it's not great - but within its genre, this film aint too bad.",3,"Within its genre, this film is really top notch!",1031702400,"09 11, 2002",2002,2633,"['Puppet', 'Masters', 'one', 'films', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'pass', 'thinking', 'similar', 'murderous', 'quot', 'quot', 'movies', 'made', 'one', 'straight', 'video', 'companies.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'watched', 'film', 'not', 'was', 'aching', 'see', 'had', 'interesting', 'sounding', 'premise', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'one', 'seemed', 'very', 'familiar', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'sci-fi', 'buff', ""'ll"", 'give', 'due', 'when', 'warranted.I', 'do', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'truly', 'been', 'venerable', 'screen', 'actor.In', 'film', 'Sutherland', 'government', 'operative', 'charged', 'discovering', 'truth', 'possible', 'UFO', 'landing', 'Iowa', 'Joining', 'secret', 'service-like', 'son', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Eric', 'Thal', 'Rounding', 'out', 'investigative', 'group', 'NASA', 'scientist', 'played', 'Julie', 'Warner', 'Thal', 'Warner', 'are', 'very', 'attractive', 'athletic', 'looking', 'Thal', 'looks', 'fashion', 'model', 'body', 'tri-athlete', 'When', 'peels', 'off', 'shirt', 'can', 'see', 'sinuey', 'muscle', 'chest', 'abdomen', 'not', 'guy', 'would', 'want', 'have', 'go', 'up', 'fact', 'out', 'team', 'are', 'forced', 'face', 'formidable', 'foe', 'aliens', 'who', 'have', 'landed.The', 'Puppet', 'Masters', 'supposedly', 'source', 'material', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'films', 'Written', 'Robert', 'Heinlien', 'book', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'supposedly', 'very', 'similar', 'movie', 'not', 'Body', 'Snatcher', 'movies.The', 'aliens', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'envelope', 'humans', 'early', 'films', 'then', 'replicate', 'are', 'parasitic', 'take', 'over', 'human', 'host', 'minds.This', 'movie', 'many', 'exciting', 'moments', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'quite', 'often', 'found', 'refreshingly', 'simplistic', 'approach', 'lacking', 'early', 'films', 'attempt', 'maintain', 'Heinlien', 'supposed', 'inferences', 'McCarthyism', '1950', 'Instead', 'saw', 'pure', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'really', 'was', 'believable', 'one', 'key', 'point', 'Richard', 'Belzer', 'infected', 'alien', 'then', 'removed', 'severe', 'withdrawals', 'when', 'creature', 'removed', 'up', 'committing', 'suicide', 'Subsequent', 'removals', 'aliens', 'victims', 'do', 'not', 'result', 'withdrawals', 'Belzer', 'experienced', 'certainly', 'do', 'not', 'result', 'suicides', 'fact', 'freed', 'victims', 'seem', 'have', 'strong', 'resolve', 'might', 'write', 'off', 'stronger', 'resolve', 'Belzer', 'character', 'government', 'agent', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'strong', 'one', 'point', 'aside', 'movie', 'maintain', 'much', 'continuity', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'quot', 'quot', 'not', 'great', 'genre', 'film', 'aint', 'too', 'bad']",Puppet Masters VHS

Where starship troopers was possibly the worst movie ever made (not excluding plan 9 from outer space), this film is actually quite good.The cast is good, if not extraordinary.  The big name talent of the film was Donald Sutherland, who did an excellent job of capturing the character found in the book.  I was pleased with Julie Warner's perfomance as Mary, and both pleased and surprised by Eric Thal's perfomance as Sam.  Granted he did have a disturbing habit of exhibiting emotion with his mouth, but he was a pleasant character.If you haven't read the book, I highly suggest that you do, it is better.  At the same time, I felt that the changes that were made were good ones.  It modernized the concept to fit with our current culture and technological level, as opposed to Heinlein's hypothetical, and unrealistic future depiction.  The movie flowed fairly well with the exception of the end.The problem with the end was primarily during the whole encephalitis/cure thread.  There was a somewhat abrupt and unpolished feel to this.

The cast is great (especially the always dependable Donald Sutherland as the Old Man) and the script starts out well.

The book isn't Heinlein's best work but his worst is at least readable.Likewise, the movie is mostly watchable. It just doesn't maintain its crackle all the way through. And at this late date, we really need something more impressive than the usual run of 'pod people' to justify making this movie, since Finney's book has already been done _three times_. (And yes, I _do_ want a movie -- and a book -- where somebody asks why the aliens 'hate' us. Was _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ filmed in vain?)I really wanted to like it, and to some extent I do.

373197,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,630340720X,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 3]","I was apprehensive about watching this movie because of the generally poor professional reviews.  Thus, it has taken me nine years to get around to watching it.  I'm glad I did.  The book is reasonably faithful to the well-written book by Robert A. Heinlein.  There are departures from the book to keep the movie moving along, but the essence of the movie remains faithful to the story.One of the interesting things about the book and the movie, which some reviewers have pointed to as poor acting, is that Donald Sutherland (as Andrew Nivens) and Eric Thal (as Sam Nivens, Andrew's son) seem to be relatively expressionless.  Heinlein described both characters as being rather stoic, nearly emotionless people in his book.  It's difficult to portray that type of character on the screen because the acting can come across as wooden or emotionless.  Eric Thal acted Heinlein wrote Sam Nivens.  I am not sufficiently familiar with Eric Thal to comment on his acting abilities in general, but I reasonably satisfied by his portrayal of Sam.  His acting could have been better, but it was acceptable.One point that I found rather distressing is that in Heinlein's original story, everyone was pretty much running around with minimal clothing by the end of the story to prevent the slugs from hiding in pants or loose underwear, as the slugs were fairly small.  The movie minimized this exposure, likely because it might have distracted further from the movie.  However, one of society's first reactions in this situation would be to have everyone nearly nude to prevent slug-ridden people from infiltrating those that were not.Unfortunately for this movie it came much later than many other movies that may share similar concepts.  However, consider that the original novel was published in 1951, and pre-dates the vast majority of movies such as ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" ""Alien"" and the great host of other alien possession movies.  Thus, all these other movies may be derivative from the book ""The Puppet Masters,"" but not the other way around, particularly considering how faithful the movie was to the book.There have been few movie-makers brave enough to attempt filming a Heinlein book; unfortunate, because Heinlein is one of the most influential science fiction writers of all time.  The two recent movies based on Heinlein's books are B-movies (this movie and ""Starship Troopers""), but for all their flaws they are a very rare treat for hard-core science fiction fans and for Heinlein fans.  I admit I stretched a little to rate this movie four stars, but I own this one and I will watch this movie again.",4,Good Adaptation of the 1951 Book,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,2620,"['was', 'apprehensive', 'watching', 'movie', 'generally', 'poor', 'professional', 'reviews', 'Thus', 'taken', 'nine', 'years', 'get', 'watching', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'book', 'reasonably', 'faithful', 'well-written', 'book', 'Robert', 'A.', 'Heinlein', 'are', 'departures', 'book', 'keep', 'movie', 'moving', 'along', 'essence', 'movie', 'faithful', 'story.One', 'interesting', 'things', 'book', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'poor', 'acting', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Andrew', 'Nivens', 'Eric', 'Thal', 'Sam', 'Nivens', 'Andrew', 'son', 'seem', 'be', 'relatively', 'expressionless', 'Heinlein', 'described', 'characters', 'being', 'rather', 'stoic', 'nearly', 'emotionless', 'people', 'book', 'difficult', 'portray', 'type', 'character', 'screen', 'acting', 'can', 'come', 'wooden', 'emotionless', 'Eric', 'Thal', 'acted', 'Heinlein', 'wrote', 'Sam', 'Nivens', 'am', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'familiar', 'Eric', 'Thal', 'comment', 'acting', 'abilities', 'general', 'reasonably', 'satisfied', 'portrayal', 'Sam', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'acceptable.One', 'point', 'found', 'rather', 'distressing', 'Heinlein', 'original', 'story', 'everyone', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'running', 'around', 'minimal', 'clothing', 'end', 'story', 'prevent', 'slugs', 'hiding', 'pants', 'loose', 'underwear', 'slugs', 'were', 'fairly', 'small', 'movie', 'minimized', 'exposure', 'likely', 'might', 'have', 'distracted', 'further', 'movie', 'However', 'one', 'society', 'first', 'reactions', 'situation', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'everyone', 'nearly', 'nude', 'prevent', 'slug-ridden', 'people', 'infiltrating', 'were', 'not.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'came', 'much', 'later', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'may', 'share', 'similar', 'concepts', 'However', 'consider', 'original', 'novel', 'was', 'published', '1951', 'vast', 'majority', 'movies', 'such', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'Alien', 'great', 'host', 'other', 'alien', 'possession', 'movies', 'Thus', 'other', 'movies', 'may', 'be', 'derivative', 'book', 'Puppet', 'Masters', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'particularly', 'considering', 'how', 'faithful', 'movie', 'was', 'book.There', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'movie-makers', 'brave', 'enough', 'attempt', 'filming', 'Heinlein', 'book', 'unfortunate', 'Heinlein', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'science', 'fiction', 'writers', 'time', 'two', 'recent', 'movies', 'based', 'Heinlein', 'books', 'are', 'B-movies', 'movie', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'flaws', 'are', 'very', 'rare', 'treat', 'hard-core', 'science', 'fiction', 'fans', 'Heinlein', 'fans', 'admit', 'stretched', 'little', 'rate', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'own', 'one', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'again']",Puppet Masters VHS

As an old Heinlein fan, few of his stories have made it onto the silver screen, and usually with mixed results (such as Starship Troopers, which I didn't hate like some fans, and thought it was okay). But this is a better movie and more faithful to the original Heinlein idea.Is it a great flick? Well, probably not, but then most movies aren't--but it's a decent one and like I said--pretty faithful to the original Heinlein. I find S-F fans are a bit too territorial and quick to find fault with movies based on their hero's novels, and I try to steer a middle course. Movies after all do usually require some artistic license, as long as it's not inappropriate or misrepresents the original.Overall, the story is suspensefully and accurately rendered, the acting is good, and some of the special effects are pretty impressive. The alien ""slugs"" were especially convincing, and the special effects guys did some nice work there. I agree that the half hour fight at the end got a little long, but the first hour of the movie is solid.

373199,A22R1X2P28BFCV,630340720X,Mark K. Rempel,"[0, 2]","This late entry to the paranoid the enemy within aspect of science fiction films is an anachronism in that it is based on a book that started the alien symbiotic-parasite phenomena in science fiction back in 1951, but then was copied by other films such as Fiend Without a Face, The Brain Eaters, and many others. It was until 1994 that a film was titled The Puppet Masters was made and credit given to Robert A. Heinlein, after all those other unauthorized rip offs. It has been decades since I read the novel, but I remember that the Nivens family of the scientist intelligence division had an incestuous relationship, and they were a twisted, perverse type of family that were in a position to save the world from aliens. This survives in the film in the father-son relationship tension, but in the book the Mary character was a sister, not someone brought in from NASA. The Walt Disney Company had delete the incest factor of the heroes, but heroes with problems of their own often make more interesting characters. By 1994 the idea of the enemy within had been film too often for it to be an interesting idea. Also the idea of Communism as a beatific hive-mind commune (which is what the aliens wanted to create) as something evil is too late. I suspect Heinlein hated the hippie ideology of communes and all is one thinking. For this film (the book more so) emphasizes the libertarian hyper-individualism that is so American.  This film itself is an exercise in paranoia, that our individuality is taken from us and we join a telepathic collective, and such an idea is evil. The film stretches out too long, is violent, militaristic, and casually destructive, all hallmarks of a Hollywood action film. It tries to make a horror film from the idea of an alien symbiosis, and so comes off as a relic and ridiculous. But then, there are right-wingers who think communes are evil and wicked.

However even though ""The Puppet Masters"" is arguably one of the best sci-fi *stories* ever written, the movie (as usual), does it no justice at all.  All the essential social elements have been removed and as is so often the case in science fiction movies the scene has been moved to the present day presumeably to make the audience identify with the characters more and also to save money on special effects.All the nudity and sex of the original novel has been removed in favour of a new (token) black character, a large rubber ""nest creature"" and a *lot* of shooting and marine-type lingo like ""lock and load"" etc...  I guess this makes it more of an ""action"" movie?Despite what the other reviewer says, Sutherland does not overact and is his usual great self, the big flaw in terms of casting is the CREEPY Eric Thal as the lead guy (how can you identify with that?), and the repulsive Julie Warner doing a bad Barbara Streisand impersonation as his sexy??? girlfriend.  (I mean when the damsel is in distress you should want the guy to save her whereas I found myself cheering for her execution.)

Hubbard,"[6, 7]","A a Heinlein fan, I was so disgusted when Starship Troopers came out since it had almost nothing in common with the book but the name and the most basic of premises. But then along came the Puppet Masters and I was pretty happy with this really great movie despite a few cosmetic changes to make the movie doable without a huge budget; while flying cars might have been kind of cool, not having them didn't make a difference to the spirit of the movie or the book. Nor did I miss seeing a lot of people running around near-naked like in the book.While the movie is not 100 per cent true to the book, it's still a very good adaptation and any fan of the book would enjoy it nonetheless. My only gripe is with the DVD itself: I had seen this movie on Showtime, and not in the restrictive widescreen format that the DVD has. While this may be great for very large screen TVs, the letter-box format doesn't work for me at all and we consummers should be given the choice to buy wide screen or full screen versions.And, then too, there are no other special features which would have been nice.

Schneider,"[6, 12]","THE PUPPET MASTERS actually does start out intriguingly enough; two Midwestern boys, playing in the farm fields of Iowa, witness a spaceship landing in the distance.  Naturally, they run to check it out.  What happens next is strange and not easily explainable--at first.After the opening titles, we are introduced to the main characters, a field of government agents headed by Donald Sutherland (who has mastered the art of subtle earnestness in his career), and populated by Eric Thal (remember him as the young Hasidic scholar who becomes involved with Melanie Griffith in A STRANGER AMONG US?) and Julie Warner (who exudes both passion and intelligence in this role).  After some portentious signs, there are two or three truly exciting action sequences, one right after another.  The problem is, after all of this, I looked at my watch and found that there was still over an hour of movie to go.  That's when the film becomes, as my title says, dull as dishwater.In the last hour, which seems more like two, this film endlessly repeats itself, in scene after scene.  Plans of attack are presented to us, and then played out of us in the same exact way, so that there is no suspense.  After three or four such consecutive scenes, there begins to be no interest, either.  Then, there are the agonizingly long scenes involving Eric Thal and Julie Warner alone together, played out slowly and without soundtrack as if suddenly turning into Steven Soderburgh's sex, lies and videotape (truly a great film; however, that same style does NOT fit into this ""thriller"" well at all).  What we end up with is a very ungainly, uneven film that alternates between high-charged action/sci-fi scenes and those containing long stretches of dull-as-dishwater dialogue.  By the end, I was very happy--that it was over, as I nearly fell asleep ten times in the last half-hour alone!Now I know why this film received largely negative reviews when it was initially released in theaters in late-1994.  It's too bad, as it is from the classic novel by Robert A. Heinlein; unread by me, the basic concept is fascinating and reminds me of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (both 1962 and 1978)--except both of these classic sci-fi/horror films are more exciting than this one. Come to think of it, Donald Sutherland was in the latter BODY SNATCHERS film, and did much better in that much better film.
