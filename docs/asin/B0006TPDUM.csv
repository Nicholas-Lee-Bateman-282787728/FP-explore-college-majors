874061,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0006TPDUM,Dennis Littrell,"[11, 19]","This is the kind of film you see at an art film festival at some inopportune time after you've already watched twenty films.  You start watching it and it seems so boring that you know it can't be THAT boring.  You're missing something.  You sit up and you concentrate.  Nothing happens.  There is this woman with a club foot.  She sways and totters up and down like a boat caught in waves as she drags her foot down a sparsely-lit corridor.  The camera is at one end of the corridor and it records her progress.  Then after she is gone, the camera holds on the empty corridor for some long seconds, make that literally minutes, and then cuts to another scene.This time the camera is looking out into a darkened movie theater.  There are only a couple of people seated in the red seats.  Finally some dialogue.  It's from the movie being shown, a kind of sword and warlord melodrama set in the Ming Dynasty.  (Actually it's King Hu's Dragon Inn (1967), a martial arts epic--hence the name of this movie).  The camera watches the face of one particular viewer.  He is just sitting there watching the movie.  The camera watches him watching the movie.  It watches him watching the movie for a long time.At some later point the guy goes to the bathroom.  He's actually a Japanese tourist.  He stands next to some other guy at a urinal.  Another guy comes in and stands at a third urinal.  One guy smokes a cigarette.  Some time passes.  Then there is another scene.  The woman with the club foot is in the bathroom.  She opens one stall and flushes the toilet.  She opens another stall and flushes the toilet.  The camera stays on the scene until she has flushed the last toilet, and then holds on the empty bathroom...At this point you figure out what is going on.  This is an anti-film.  Everything is backwards.  The film maker (Tsai Ming-Liang) is not trying to entertain you, to impress you, or to excite you, or rally you to some cause, dazzle you, invoke your tears, uplift you, scare you, redeem you--no, the film maker is doing exactly the opposite of what film normally tries to do.And then there's another scene, as if to confirm your interpretation.  The one guy and another stand in the corridor smoking cigarettes.  There is after a bit some words from the second man.  He says this theater is haunted.  There is no response.  He says ""Ghosts.""  No response.  The camera now gets a little closer so that you see the men from perhaps a few feet away.  Their heads are turned away from the camera so that only the back of their heads and a little bit of the sides of their faces can be seen.  The camera holds.  No one says anything.And finally near the end of the film after the theater has been closed for the night (actually forever, as this is about the death of the movie house), one guy puts his palm on a fortune telling machine.  The machine says, ""Enter your question.""  He punches a button.  After a bit, the machine says, ""Please take your fortune.""  A pause, and then the machine kicks out the fortune on a strip of paper.  The guy takes it and reads it.  And then he leaves.  The camera does NOT show his fortune.The part you like best comes at the end as a woman sings a Chinese song about ""Half was bitter; half was sweet.""  Her voice is gorgeous and the melody is engaging.  And then the title characters run down the screen.Okay, this film really IS boring unless you are a true student of film, and then you can see that this anti-film about people watching a film is a statement about the film-maker's art.  As you leave the theater, now having seen twenty-one films, you declare that this was very interesting, and you know you are going to vote this one higher than some of the others because it so deliberately bored you that you were not really bored at all, compared to some other films that took themselves too seriously and really did bore you.  ""Interesting,"" you say to your companion.  ""Really makes a statement,"" he says.  ""Beautiful in a way,"" you say.  ""Yes,"" he says.Suddenly you have an angle on the film.  You're thinking, ""Goodbye, Dragon Inn"" somehow reminds you of the lyric from the Elton John song about Marilyn Monroe.  The lyric is, ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.""  Same thing, you think--or at least the same melancholy idea.",3,An anti-film,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,4274,"['kind', 'film', 'see', 'art', 'film', 'festival', 'inopportune', 'time', ""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', 'twenty', 'films', 'start', 'watching', 'so', 'boring', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'boring', ""'re"", 'missing', 'something', 'sit', 'up', 'concentrate', 'Nothing', 'woman', 'club', 'foot', 'up', 'boat', 'caught', 'waves', 'foot', 'down', 'sparsely-lit', 'corridor', 'camera', 'one', 'end', 'corridor', 'progress', 'Then', 'gone', 'camera', 'empty', 'corridor', 'long', 'seconds', 'make', 'literally', 'minutes', 'then', 'cuts', 'scene.This', 'time', 'camera', 'looking', 'out', 'darkened', 'movie', 'theater', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'people', 'seated', 'red', 'seats', 'Finally', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'being', 'shown', 'kind', 'sword', 'warlord', 'melodrama', 'set', 'Ming', 'Dynasty', 'King', 'Hu', 'Dragon', 'Inn', '1967', 'martial', 'arts', 'epic', 'hence', 'name', 'movie', 'camera', 'face', 'one', 'particular', 'viewer', 'just', 'sitting', 'there', 'watching', 'movie', 'camera', 'watching', 'movie', 'watching', 'movie', 'long', 'time.At', 'later', 'point', 'guy', 'bathroom', 'actually', 'Japanese', 'tourist', 'next', 'other', 'guy', 'urinal', 'guy', 'stands', 'third', 'urinal', 'One', 'guy', 'cigarette', 'time', 'passes', 'Then', 'scene', 'woman', 'club', 'foot', 'bathroom', 'one', 'stall', 'toilet', 'stall', 'toilet', 'camera', 'scene', 'flushed', 'last', 'toilet', 'then', 'empty', 'bathroom', 'point', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'anti-film', 'Everything', 'backwards', 'film', 'maker', 'Tsai', 'Ming-Liang', 'not', 'trying', 'entertain', 'impress', 'excite', 'rally', 'cause', 'dazzle', 'invoke', 'tears', 'uplift', 'scare', 'redeem', 'film', 'maker', 'doing', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'what', 'film', 'normally', 'do.And', 'then', 'scene', 'confirm', 'interpretation', 'one', 'guy', 'stand', 'corridor', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'bit', 'words', 'second', 'man', 'theater', 'haunted', 'response', 'Ghosts', 'response', 'camera', 'now', 'little', 'closer', 'so', 'see', 'men', 'perhaps', 'few', 'feet', 'away', 'heads', 'are', 'turned', 'away', 'camera', 'so', 'only', 'back', 'heads', 'little', 'bit', 'sides', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'camera', 'one', 'anything.And', 'finally', 'end', 'film', 'theater', 'been', 'closed', 'night', 'actually', 'forever', 'death', 'movie', 'house', 'one', 'guy', 'palm', 'fortune', 'telling', 'machine', 'machine', 'Enter', 'question', 'button', 'bit', 'machine', 'Please', 'take', 'fortune', 'pause', 'then', 'machine', 'out', 'fortune', 'strip', 'paper', 'guy', 'then', 'camera', 'NOT', 'show', 'fortune.The', 'part', 'best', 'end', 'woman', 'Chinese', 'song', 'Half', 'was', 'bitter', 'half', 'was', 'sweet', 'voice', 'gorgeous', 'melody', 'engaging', 'then', 'title', 'characters', 'run', 'down', 'screen.Okay', 'film', 'really', 'IS', 'boring', 'are', 'true', 'student', 'film', 'then', 'can', 'see', 'anti-film', 'people', 'watching', 'film', 'statement', 'film-maker', 'art', 'leave', 'theater', 'now', 'having', 'seen', 'twenty-one', 'films', 'declare', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'vote', 'one', 'higher', 'others', 'so', 'deliberately', 'bored', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'bored', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'took', 'too', 'seriously', 'really', 'did', 'bore', 'Interesting', 'say', 'companion', 'Really', 'statement', 'Beautiful', 'way', 'say', 'Yes', 'says.Suddenly', 'have', 'angle', 'film', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'Goodbye', 'Dragon', 'Inn', 'somehow', 'lyric', 'Elton', 'John', 'song', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'lyric', 'Goodbye', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'Same', 'thing', 'think', 'least', 'same', 'melancholy', 'idea']",N/A

Intimations of ghosts inhabiting the theater are physically reflected in the isolated souls of a beautiful ticket booth operator and bathroom attendant (Chen Shiang-chyi) - seemingly trapped in a dead-end job by her physical disability - and a projectionist (Lee Kang-sheng), who perform the empty motions of their tasks in a solemn, silent ritual of their seeming existential limbo.

I had stumbled on this in the foreign movie section of my local library and after a casual glance at the DVD jacket, I decided to pick it up.""Goodbye, Dragon Inn"" (2003 release from Taiwan; 82 min.) brings the story of the last evening at the Fu-Ho Grand Theatre in Taipei. Indeed everything is grand about that theatre, with its immense auditorium, but it is clear that the theatre has seen better days. On this last evening (we see at the end that a sign ""Temporarily Closed"" is put up at the theatre's box office), there is a sparse audience which is watching a showing of an old Chinese movie from the 1960s called ""Dragon Inn"". We follow the lady who manages the box office and just about everything else in the theatre. We get to know the projectionist. We also follow some of the movie viewers (with the inevitable loud and cranky indivuals), etc. There really is no other story line as such, and hence no dramatic undertone of any kind.Highly unusual is that there is little to no camera movement in many of the scenes. Instead the camera seems to be an observer, as if the camera were us had we been there. At the end of the movie, when the theatre's house lights come on, we see the box office lady enterning the auditorium, going around to pick up some trash, and then leave. This scene takes several minutes, and may annoy some to no end, but I found it a thing of beauty. It does not mean that this movie offers a lot of 'entertainment'. This movie is art with a capital A. It is also one of the most unusual movies I have ever seen in my life and for that alone, I am glad I saw it.

874067,A3AC7H2Q6DFMVK,B0006TPDUM,"Sur-reel Life, All About My Movies ""Phil X""","[23, 27]","Tsai Ming-liang's follow-up to his breakthrough film, ""What Time is It There?"" is an absorbing visual poem about the pros and cons of going to the movies. While it is less expansive than his previous outing, it clearly belongs alongside the director's other films. Like the rest, it features lonely characters in an urban setting, as well as long, static shots.""Good Bye, Dragon Inn"" takes place in an old-fashioned movie house, which has one screen, shows revivals of classics, and suffers from a lack of customers. The Fu-Ho Grand Theater, as it is called, doesn't quite live up to its namesake anymore. Much of the interior seems dilapidated, and the overall mood approaches sadness.The movie alternates between a ticket woman with a bad leg (Shiang-chyi Chen), who seems to be the only employee of this vast theatre, and a young man (Kiyonobu Mitamura) who has come to enjoy King Hu's martial arts epic ""Dragon Inn."" She happens to be away from the booth when he wanders in, so he sneaks into the theater sans ticket. The two characters remain on separate paths: she performs her nightly routine, while he attempts to enjoy ""Dragon Inn."" Through the course of the film, they never connect with each other. Nor anybody else, for that matter.Practically half the movie is spent showing the ticket woman hobbling to her locker, a Herculian task given the Fu-Ho's size. Often, the director will let the camera linger until the character retreats from the frame completely. This technique slows down the rhythm of the editing, which affects the speed at which the audience perceives events. But it also emphasizes the solitude of the character, since she remains the sole subject of Ming-liang's interminable shots.In the case of the young man, the extended takes capture his growing frustration. He does not enter the Fu-Ho Grand looking to be an island onto himself. But petty annoyances, stretched out over the course of long, uninterrupted shots, go a long way towards alienating him from his fellow movie-goers. He hops from seat to seat, but everywhere he goes, he encounters couples who make loud snacking noises, or sneakers next to his head. Occasionally, his interest is piqued by a fellow patron. Unfortunately, his friendly approach often meets a cold shoulder.The youth never acheives any kind of connection with anyone. There are men who cruise the Fu-Ho looking for dispassionate sex, but it's dispassionate to the point of being invisible. In one scene, which takes place in the men's room, he never realizes sexual congress has been happening in a nearby stall until the surprise appearance of the second participant. The joke is how subdued, how unimpressively muted, both parties must have been to accomplish such stealthy relations.Somehow, the youth locates a hidden labyrinth, frequented by men who wear yearnful looks. They wander through shadowy passageways, eyeing one another, squeezing against each other in narrow spots. These shots depict friction without actual heat. The youth's standards, being higher than some, explain why he holds out until meeting someone who tickles his fancy. He approaches a boyishly-handsome stranger in a blue button-up (Kang-sheng Lee, a Ming-liang regular since 1992's ""Rebels of the Neon God""). But despite early indications, this one isn't interested either. Once again, instead of hooking up, the young man finds himself left high and dry.The way the director handles it, however, proves strangely amusing. He waits until the moment both characters appear most intimate-the stranger having ignited the youth's cigarette, as well as his libido. When the former leans in as if to kiss the stranger, the latter nonchalantly states the theater is haunted, then walks away. One suspects that the youth has just encountered a ghost himself, but he is too busy being sexually frustrated to heed the message.Could the Fu-Ho really be haunted, or was the stranger simply messing with the young man's mind? Several scenes imply the former, such as the ghostly young woman who makes eating sunflower seeds seem like Chinese water torture. There is also the appearance of two actors from the film ""Dragon Inn"": Shih Chun and Tien Miao (another veteran of Ming-liang's films). They mourn how no one goes to see movies anymore, and how the images of their younger selves have faded from the public mind. In either scenario, these characters could be people off the street, or they could indeed be spectres. Ming-liang never states anything explicitly.Personally, I much prefer the ambiguity. The suggestion of ghosts completely changes our perception of shots at the beginning of the film. Remember those opening images: Countless heads staring forward at the projection against the movie screen. In later shots, what happened to those extras? Were they ever really there, or could Ming-liang have been implying something more mystical, that human beings leave part of themselves behind, even when they go to the movies?Upon looking back, I wondered whether the ticket woman, who never interacts with anyone, could have been a ghost. Perhaps she is cursed to haunt the corridors of the Fu-Ho, a Sisyphus-like spirit who sweeps floors instead of rolling boulders. More likely, however, she's a real person, whose condition restricts her to menial labor. But working at the cinema allows her certain privileges: There is that wonderful moment when she walks behind the theater screen, and stares up at the giant image of a warrior woman from ""Dragon Inn."" The camera cuts back-and-forth between her and the female fighter, as lights from the silver screen play off her face. Not only does this moment perfectly capture the liberating power of the cinema, it offers insight into the ticket woman. We realize that, in spite of the difficult working conditions, she might have chosen to be here all along, in exchange for moments like this one.""Good Bye, Dragon Inn,"" is noteworthy enough for being filmed in the director's signature style. It's also set in an interesting place, and has something to say about movie-going experience. In addition, everything that happens to the youth while he tries to watch ""Dragon Inn"" adds up to a humorous assemblage of common moviegoer complaints.Above all, the movie takes place in a theater, which Ming-liang turns into a microcosm of big city problems. The Fu-Ho itself is an historical edifice left to rot, and contains episodes about personal space (the ""noise pollution"" from the snack-eaters in the viewing room) as well as social alienation (the lonely ticket woman, the silent men in the labyrinth). There is also a crime issue, as deviant behavior has creeped into a place that welcomes young children (the bathroom liaisons, the gay men cruising the labyrinth).What caused this downward spiral? Is the decline of the Fu-Ho Grand Theater predicated by the same factors that have affected the movie-showing business in America? Too much piracy? Too many entertainment alternatives? Has their industrialized culture broken too many communities into disparate islands onto themselves, for whom the thought of sharing space, time, and experience seems unbearable?",5,"A Movie-going
