I watched this classic gothic soap opera every day after school from 1966 to 1971.  I loved it and still do.  This bloopers and treasures disc is great because I had forgotten how many screw-ups there really were in this show, and somehow these consummate professional actors managed to get through them all.  Whether it's someone forgetting or messing up their lines or stage hands walking across the set during a scene or props malfunctioning or equipment hovering in plain view, this collection is hysterical and priceless.  It brought back a lot of fond memories, especially when I did happen to remember one of the bloopers, and it was great to see scenes from one of my all-time favorite shows again.",5,CLASSIC STUFF FROM A CLASSIC SHOW!,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,781,"['are', 'die-hard', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'fan', 'am', 'must', 'have', 'DVD', 'watched', 'classic', 'gothic', 'soap', 'opera', 'day', 'school', '1966', '1971', 'loved', 'still', 'do', 'bloopers', 'treasures', 'disc', 'great', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'many', 'screw-ups', 'really', 'were', 'show', 'somehow', 'consummate', 'professional', 'actors', 'managed', 'get', 'someone', 'forgetting', 'messing', 'up', 'lines', 'stage', 'hands', 'walking', 'set', 'scene', 'malfunctioning', 'equipment', 'hovering', 'plain', 'view', 'collection', 'hysterical', 'priceless', 'brought', 'back', 'lot', 'fond', 'memories', 'especially', 'when', 'did', 'happen', 'remember', 'one', 'bloopers', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'scenes', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'shows', 'again']",N/A

When I got this DVD I watched it with my sister who also was a Dark Shadows fan and we laughed our heads off.  If you love Dark Shadows or if you just like good bloopers you will love this dvd.  My favorite part is where the character Barnabas Collins can't get rid of a fly that is on his nose!

1008873,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000H1RFEQ,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[5, 5]","Since ""Dark Shadows"" was recorded ""live on tape"" it meant that the show would start recording around 4pm in the afternoon and go through the entire 30 minute script hopefully without any mistakes. The reason way ABC refused to edit changes in the final cuts of the episodes was simply one of money. Nancy Barret who played Carolyn Stoddard once said that if actors made a mistake it was rarely if ever edited out, except in the case you fell down the stairs and broke your neck, but even then the network would give it thought.Unlike other soap operas of the day ""Dark Shadows"", thanks to creator Dan Curtis, had all its shows in their entirty, except one from 1971 so watching the series now is fun to see the various times actors forgot lines, booms and microphones appearing, sets falling down, and cameras going crazy and off to other directions when they were suppose to be on the actor. When one watches these bloopers you do get the feeling everyone from the directors to the actors and other crew members had one thing in common: to make ""Dark Shadows"" the best possible serial on the air and they did it, albeit with mishaps. I have watched many other soaps that have some of their episodes from the same period in tact and the same thing happened on ""Another World"", The Edge of Night"" and ""General Hospital"". The reason ""Dark Shadows"" is known for their bloopers and mishaps is because of the sheer popularity of the series.The treasure part of this DVD features a plethora of goodies including an interview with Lara Parker who discusses the serial, various actors on game shows and much more.",5,"""Fun, Fun, Fun""",1342742400,"07 20, 2012",2012,1605,"['Dark', 'Shadows', 'was', 'recorded', 'live', 'tape', 'meant', 'show', 'would', 'start', 'recording', 'around', '4pm', 'afternoon', 'go', 'entire', '30', 'minute', 'script', 'hopefully', 'mistakes', 'reason', 'way', 'ABC', 'refused', 'edit', 'changes', 'final', 'cuts', 'episodes', 'was', 'simply', 'one', 'money', 'Nancy', 'Barret', 'who', 'played', 'Carolyn', 'Stoddard', 'once', 'said', 'actors', 'made', 'mistake', 'was', 'rarely', 'ever', 'edited', 'out', 'case', 'fell', 'down', 'stairs', 'broke', 'neck', 'even', 'then', 'network', 'would', 'give', 'other', 'soap', 'operas', 'day', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'thanks', 'creator', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'had', 'shows', 'entirty', 'one', '1971', 'so', 'watching', 'series', 'now', 'fun', 'see', 'various', 'times', 'actors', 'forgot', 'lines', 'booms', 'microphones', 'appearing', 'sets', 'falling', 'down', 'cameras', 'going', 'crazy', 'other', 'directions', 'when', 'were', 'suppose', 'be', 'actor', 'When', 'one', 'bloopers', 'do', 'get', 'feeling', 'everyone', 'directors', 'actors', 'other', 'crew', 'members', 'had', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'make', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'best', 'possible', 'serial', 'air', 'did', 'mishaps', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'other', 'soaps', 'have', 'episodes', 'same', 'period', 'tact', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'World', 'Edge', 'Night', 'General', 'Hospital', 'reason', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'known', 'bloopers', 'mishaps', 'sheer', 'popularity', 'series.The', 'treasure', 'part', 'DVD', 'plethora', 'goodies', 'including', 'interview', 'Lara', 'Parker', 'who', 'serial', 'various', 'actors', 'game', 'shows', 'much', 'more']",N/A
