Here we are in the environs of new jersey-new york with the added star power of denzel washington and a new whitney houson(probably one of her more satisfying performances). The film feels good it has children and singing,gives us a sense of community and how a community can grow and how christians can develop and inspire and hold back a community,and at times how a community can be inspired and renewed by a church and also by the modern forces of large capital as here evinced by the large developers who will buy the church and replace it with a shopping mall, emphasizing the sterility of modern culture,and how our cities really need churches! The locale is around a developer known as hamilton real estate and we are in the modern world and the church community with pastor and estranged wife played by houston,are visited by an enigmatic angel The angel here is not the usual staid boring figure,but notices this community lacks love,and how can it move forward if the love between pastor and his wife has stalled. The pastor notices the angel spends much time in conversation and fun and excitement with his wife going out and conversing in a series of outings,and the pastor upset confronts him,and the angel responds he was just sharing love and at the film's end the pastor notes this love,how it renews the community and he now recommits himself to love to the long lost relationship. There is also a subplot about an innocent man being imprisoned and then exonerated and a developer wanting to pull out the church from the community and replace it with a shopping mall. Interesting story! At films end feeled with love the preacher gives a jesse jackson type speech detailing the needs of the community,and we have a parting scene where the angel leaves the pastor's wife,filled with love within,the kingdom being within him and he wanted neither to control or hem in or sexually take advantage of the preacher's wife,but to shower her with love,and he corrects the jealousy of the preacher,the ideas and fixations in his mind preventing him and the community from growing in love,as the whole world and even the developer at the films end,worships at christmas services. A christmas story,in these days not realistic,but great performances and good twist on old theme gives movie freshness...as well as performances!!It's unfortunate we recently lost Houston,who had her own battle with inner demons externalized through addictions,and associated disorders,a truely beautiful person and talented performer,and for some reason very few film performances,which is odd since many of her films did good box office! We miss her work,but more than that we feel bad she really couldnt enjoy her success and she is sadly gone...",4,great christmas film,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,2794,"['very', 'difficult', 'get', 'good', 'christmas', 'films', 'anymore', 'Here', 'are', 'environs', 'new', 'jersey-new', 'york', 'added', 'star', 'power', 'denzel', 'washington', 'new', 'whitney', 'houson', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'satisfying', 'performances', 'film', 'feels', 'good', 'children', 'singing', 'sense', 'community', 'how', 'community', 'can', 'grow', 'how', 'christians', 'can', 'develop', 'inspire', 'hold', 'back', 'community', 'times', 'how', 'community', 'can', 'be', 'inspired', 'renewed', 'church', 'also', 'modern', 'forces', 'large', 'capital', 'here', 'evinced', 'large', 'developers', 'who', 'will', 'buy', 'church', 'replace', 'shopping', 'mall', 'emphasizing', 'sterility', 'modern', 'culture', 'how', 'cities', 'really', 'need', 'churches', 'locale', 'developer', 'known', 'hamilton', 'real', 'estate', 'are', 'modern', 'world', 'church', 'community', 'pastor', 'estranged', 'wife', 'played', 'houston', 'are', 'visited', 'enigmatic', 'angel', 'angel', 'here', 'not', 'usual', 'staid', 'boring', 'figure', 'notices', 'community', 'love', 'how', 'can', 'move', 'forward', 'love', 'pastor', 'wife', 'stalled', 'pastor', 'angel', 'much', 'time', 'conversation', 'fun', 'excitement', 'wife', 'going', 'conversing', 'series', 'outings', 'pastor', 'upset', 'confronts', 'angel', 'was', 'just', 'sharing', 'love', 'film', 'end', 'pastor', 'love', 'how', 'community', 'now', 'love', 'long', 'lost', 'relationship', 'also', 'subplot', 'innocent', 'man', 'being', 'imprisoned', 'then', 'exonerated', 'developer', 'wanting', 'pull', 'out', 'church', 'community', 'replace', 'shopping', 'mall', 'Interesting', 'story', 'films', 'end', 'feeled', 'love', 'preacher', 'jesse', 'jackson', 'type', 'speech', 'detailing', 'needs', 'community', 'have', 'parting', 'scene', 'where', 'angel', 'pastor', 'wife', 'filled', 'love', 'kingdom', 'being', 'wanted', 'control', 'hem', 'sexually', 'take', 'advantage', 'preacher', 'wife', 'shower', 'love', 'jealousy', 'preacher', 'ideas', 'fixations', 'mind', 'preventing', 'community', 'growing', 'love', 'whole', 'world', 'even', 'developer', 'films', 'end', 'worships', 'christmas', 'services', 'A', 'christmas', 'story', 'days', 'not', 'realistic', 'great', 'performances', 'good', 'twist', 'old', 'theme', 'movie', 'freshness', 'as', 'well', 'performances', 'unfortunate', 'recently', 'lost', 'Houston', 'who', 'had', 'own', 'battle', 'inner', 'demons', 'externalized', 'addictions', 'associated', 'disorders', 'truely', 'beautiful', 'person', 'talented', 'performer', 'reason', 'very', 'few', 'film', 'performances', 'odd', 'many', 'films', 'did', 'good', 'box', 'office', 'miss', 'work', 'more', 'feel', 'bad', 'really', 'couldnt', 'enjoy', 'success', 'sadly', 'gone']",Preacher's Wife VHS

It is a great movie to bring in the season as you and your family sit and watch it together. Your children will learn the power of friendship and your family as a whole will be inspired to stay strong and support one another. Denzel Washington is awesome as the angel who helps repair a strained relationship between Whitney Houston and Courtney Vance's characters.

418021,ANGH6401L9Y0T,630438386X,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","A genuine feel-good movie! When I heard of Whitney Houston's death, I could not remember if I'd ever seen or heard of her. Then various people started telling me songs they remembered, and I knew I had heard them. Somebody else told me she was also an actress, so I looked for her movies.First, the casting of the movie is superb. Denzel Washington is absolutely perfect as an angel: after all, I've always thought he looked like one. Whitney Houston, being a devout Christian, would naturally make a good preacher's wife even if she wasn't so talented. Hey, people, she was at least as much an actress as a singer. And we all know she was marvelous as a singer. Her mother plays, oddly enough, the preacher's mother-in-law. Courageous of her, given the mothers-in-law are notoriously villainous roles. She manages to be the ""you know I wouldn't interfere in other people's business"" cliche busybody and also a terrific grandmother to their two adorable kids, one of which is the story's narrator.You will see more than a little resemblance to the classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"" here. And in fact the liner notes tell me it is a remake of a 1940s movie called ""The Bishop's Wife."" I'm going to have to look for that, too.Reverend Henry Biggs (Courtney Vance) has his share of problems and a few other people's too. He prays for help, and in response, the Boss sends Dudley (Denzel Washington) to help. Of course, he has a handbook and gets several good jokes out of references to it. I won't spoil those for you. Problem is, Reverend Biggs does not believe he's really an angel, and you can't blame him. Dudley seems far more like an interference than a help.The Biggs kids know, though, because they were making snow angels out on the lawn where Dudley fell to the ground right out of the sky. Of course the grown-ups don't believe them.I was tempted to give this just four stars instead of five, because it is really pretty sugary. But heck, it's Christmas. [In the movie, I mean. I know it's April out here in the so-called real world.]Why should an atheist appreciate such a movie so much? Because I can't help thinking that if I knew more Christians like the Biggs, I might believe, too. Or at least want to.",5,She Even Charmed an Atheist!,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,2214,"['genuine', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'When', 'heard', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'death', 'could', 'not', 'remember', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'heard', 'Then', 'various', 'people', 'started', 'telling', 'songs', 'remembered', 'knew', 'had', 'heard', 'Somebody', 'else', 'told', 'was', 'also', 'actress', 'looked', 'movies.First', 'casting', 'movie', 'superb', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'angel', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'looked', 'one', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'being', 'devout', 'Christian', 'would', 'naturally', 'make', 'good', 'preacher', 'wife', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'talented', 'Hey', 'people', 'was', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'actress', 'singer', 'know', 'was', 'marvelous', 'singer', 'mother', 'plays', 'oddly', 'enough', 'preacher', 'mother-in-law', 'Courageous', 'given', 'mothers-in-law', 'are', 'notoriously', 'villainous', 'roles', 'be', 'know', 'would', ""n't"", 'interfere', 'other', 'people', 'business', 'cliche', 'busybody', 'also', 'terrific', 'grandmother', 'two', 'adorable', 'kids', 'one', 'story', 'narrator.You', 'will', 'see', 'more', 'little', 'resemblance', 'classic', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'here', 'fact', 'liner', 'notes', 'remake', '1940s', 'movie', 'called', 'Bishop', 'Wife', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'look', 'too.Reverend', 'Henry', 'Biggs', 'Courtney', 'Vance', 'share', 'problems', 'few', 'other', 'people', 'too', 'help', 'response', 'Boss', 'Dudley', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'help', 'course', 'handbook', 'several', 'good', 'jokes', 'references', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'Problem', 'Reverend', 'Biggs', 'not', 'believe', 'really', 'angel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Dudley', 'far', 'more', 'interference', 'help.The', 'Biggs', 'kids', 'know', 'though', 'were', 'making', 'snow', 'angels', 'out', 'lawn', 'where', 'Dudley', 'fell', 'ground', 'right', 'sky', 'course', 'grown-ups', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'them.I', 'was', 'tempted', 'give', 'just', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'really', 'pretty', 'sugary', 'heck', 'Christmas', '[', 'movie', 'mean', 'know', 'April', 'out', 'here', 'so-called', 'real', 'world', ']', 'Why', 'should', 'atheist', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'knew', 'more', 'Christians', 'Biggs', 'might', 'believe', 'too', 'least', 'want']",Preacher's Wife VHS

Hadn't seen it until this (2011) Christmas season when I reached it in the unwatched section of the movie shelf. Naturally, I learned what I presumed many already knew. It was intended to be, and it is, a welcome addition to the regular movie fare for Christmas. Can't imagine why we should try to compare it with the Cary Grant-Loretta Young version. Different generations, unique performers, quite different socio-cultural reference and quite similar warmth. Denzil Washington is not Cary Grant; Cary Grant was not Denzel Washington (in white face). There was no Whitney Houston in the older film, there is no Loretta Young in the new one. Enjoy each when you are in the mood for one or the other.No doubt the star of the film is the music. Whitney Houston leading a church choir or Whitney Houston in a Jazz club makes no difference. She IS ONE CLASSY SINGER. The singing with and without Ms. Houston is stimulating and satisfying. Nothing in the film can beat it; but, it makes everything else in the film better than it might otherwise be. Perhaps surprisingly, despite the number of singer/actors we have had, she also does a fine job as the Preachers Wife, who is getting a bit tired of the lack of a private life with the minister (although, with a father in the same profession, one would have thought she would have expected i)t. Denzel Washington is charming as the Angel; no room here for his normal intensity, but he fills the role well. The Preacher's role is competently handled as is the mother's; they both make solid contributions. Those handling the two little boys are to be congratulated. The boys are cute without being cloying or annoying. Hard to achieve.

418067,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,630438386X,Nicholas Carroll,"[6, 8]","Ever since I saw this film in theaters with my family in 1996, I knew this film would become an annual holiday tradition and it has. It's amazing to think how far Whitney has fallen since her role as the singing Preacher's wife, but I do consider this to be the best role she has played on screen (surpassing ""The Bodyguard"", ""Waiting to Exhale"", and ""Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella""). It was a role tailor made for her, as she did start her singing career in church and always wanted to make a Gospel album.The cast is also magnificent, as I love the lady who plays Whitney's mother with her sassy comments (""don't talk about your behind, I gave you that behind!""; ""I'm not one to pry...""), the Preacher's somewhat flustered secretary (""first he took the picture, then he took the car and moved to Cleveland"", ""Please Santa, put that man under my tree...if he can fit!""), Courtney Vance as the Preacher who's lost his spark, the boy who plays the son and narrates the film, and of course Denzel Washington as the angel who comes to offer help. Gregory Hines plays the villain role, and Lionel Ritchie has a cameo as Whitney's old flame. And cameo of cameos, Whitney's own mother Cissy plays a member of the choir.My favorite scene coincides with my favorite song on the film's soundtrack: ""My Heart is Calling"" when Whitney and Denzel go ice skating while Courtney is stuck in traffic and growing frustrated. That song should've been a single, but whatever genius decided to release the melancholy ""I Believe In You and Me"" probably killed a great opportunity to ignite Whitney's career at the time. As I remember, this film didn't do well at the box office and the soundtrack didn't fly off shelves. Had they chosen ""My Heart is Calling"" (one of Whitney's best songs ever), it might have had a different outcome. Oh well...the film remains as a must see holiday classic that I never get tired of.A year ago, I finally watched the original ""The Bishop's Wife"" and I must say that they definitely improved upon the original. To call ""The Preacher's Wife"" a remake is somehow missing the picture. They are completely different in style and I prefer the musical and modern ""Preacher's Wife"" over the 1950s/1960s film. ""The Preacher's Wife"" just makes you feel good when its all over, it's a rare family film that doesn't have any embarassing moments and one that the whole family can watch and enjoy together.

418076,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,630438386X,Simon Davis,"[42, 42]","As a rule I dont tend to warm to remakes of classic films however the Penny Marshall directed Christmas story ""The Preacher's Wife"", is a definite exception and has become one of my favourite festive season viewing experiences. Based on the classic Samuel Goldwyn film ""The Bishop's Wife"", which starred legends Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven, this 1996 effort has a charm and slant on the essentially same story all its own. Denzel Washington in the role of an angel sent down to earth to sort out the life of a preacher who has lost sight of what really is important, is a most worthy successor to Cary Grant in the original film and Whitney Houston in the female lead displays a warm screen presense and great musical talent that couldn't be bettered in this type of story. Amazingly I only saw this film for the first time 3 years ago but it has become a firm favourite of mine ever since. Combining a traditional and much loved Christmas tale with some truly wonderful gospel singing gives this effort a really upbeat feel which however never sacrifices for one minute the more touching aspects of the story.""The Preacher's Wife"", focuses on the parish of St. Matthews run by Rev. Henry Biggs (Courtney B. Vance), a well meaning and dedicated preacher who has been trying to be all things to all people in his needy area. Along the way through court cases for wrongly convicted minors, leaking furnaces, and offers by local big wig Joe Hamilton (Gregory Hines), to ""upgrade"", to a new flashy parish of the future, Henry has lost sight of his wife Julia (Whitney Houston), and their small son Jeremiah (Justin Pierre Edmund). Just when things look the blackest and Henry feels he is acheiving nothing an unexpected answer to his prayers for help comes in the form of debonair stranger Dudley (Denzel Washington), who has a hard time convincing the embattled preacher that he has been sent down to earth by ""the big guy"", to help him with his problems. Dudley has his work cut out for him as Christmas approaches and Henry gets more and more ground down by his duties in the parish. Dudley begins to provide the warm understanding companionship that Julia craves much to the growing alwarm of her well meaning mother Beverly (Loretta Devine). The pair go skating, and even go out at night to the jazz club where Julia used to perform and where Henry proposed to her. Warned off by Beverly, Dudley begins to see that he is falling in love with Julia and that that was not why he was sent back to Earth. Some well timed intervention in Joe Hamilton's crass plans for Henry makes the preacher begin to see where his real value is and what is important to him, first and foremost his family. All things come together for the Christmas pageant and service where Henry reaffirms his faith in God and his family and his place in the world. Dudley realises his work is done on earth and in a poignant finale blesses the family with a beautifully decorated Christmas Tree after which they will not recall his presense in their lives at all. Dudley attends the Christmas service at St. Matthews but the adults have no memory of him, however Jeremiah still so young at heart does still know him and wishes Dudley a Happy Christmas before he returns to Heaven with his task successfuly completed.A truly inspirational and touching story filled with some beautiful music and comic pieces is the best way to describe this beautiful little movie. I love all three lead performances here and it's a joy to see Denzel Washington, normally the star of some intensely dramatic films, in such a charming and light hearted role as Dudley. He displays a fine comic talent and teams especially well with the other two leads. If ever there was a proper successor to Cary Grant in this role then Denzel Washington is it. Whitney Houston does very well in the role of Julia and she displays a nicely touching persona especially in her scenes with her screen son. She of course comes alive in the musical numbers many of which she produced herself. I've become a big fan of gospel music after her terrific rendition of such numbers as,""Step by Step"", and especially the show stopping ""I believe in you and me"". Courtney Vance playing the earlier David Niven role of Henry is also excellent and his performance contains alot of the dramatic meat of the story as the essentially kind hearted preacher who is torn too many ways and sees himself loosing his family. His work with Denzel Washington in particular is note worthy especially in the scenes when he can't seem to understand just ""where"", this mysterious helper has suddenly come from. Other standouts in the cast are Jenifer Lewis as Julia's mother in a very funny performance full of great lines and wry observations about what is happening in the Biggs household, and Gregory Hines as sharp business man Joe Hamilton who in turn is also affected by Dudley's presense in his previously rather shallow life. The look and feel of ""The Preacher's Wife"", makes it a wonderful newer Christmas viewing experience and much of the credit goes to the church scenes with the St. Matthew's choir taking centre stage. Their singing and expert handling of all the gospel music is perfect and really gets you into the feel of the season.As a ""modern"", Christmas story I personally feel ""The Preacher's Wife"", is a most worthy successor to the well known and greatly loved earlier classics like ""White Christmas"", and ""Miracle on 34th Street"". Taking a very different slant on the story than the earlier 'The Bishop's Wife"", it manages to be wholly original in its own way and makes delightful seasonal viewing. Try and see this touching film next Christmas and I'm sure it will become a treasured part of your holiday viewing like it is in my home.",5,Great Story And Music Combine In A Terrific Christmas

418083,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,630438386X,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[4, 6]","Even with the great cast utilized here, ""The Preacher's Wife"" still seems to be lacking something. This is a remake of the old movie from the 1940s starring Loretta Young, David Niven and Cary Grant, only then it was called ""The Bishop's Wife"".There are few changes in this updated Christmas story: When Reverend Henry Biggs (Courtney B. Vance) begins to doubt his ability to make a difference in his community, and to even doubt if God can truly make miracles, he prays for guidance. The answer to his prayer is a handsome angel, Dudley (Denzel Washington), that is sent from Heaven to help restore his faith. However, the reverend does not buy the story that Dudley was actually the answer to any of his prayers or even sent by God. Dudley, here to help the preacher, ends up falling in love with the preacher's wife, Julia (Whitney Houston).The story still works to a point. For some reason though, Whitney looks like she's terrifically bored throughout the whole thing and Denzel, is gorgeous (of course), but even he can't save this movie. The reviewer is right on one point - that by the second half of the movie, the presence of the Dudley character is no longer necessary because the reverend is able to figure out how to handle things for himself. But who cares? Denzel was delightful to watch in this role. He has a flair for light romantic comedy, and that's something that you rarely see in the majority of roles that Denzel plays.Singer Lionel Richie also has a small role in this film as Julia's friend, a jazz pianist. It was a pleasant surprise to see him, since I didn't even know he was in this film. The scene with him and Julia in the jazz club is a priceless one!The film does have its moments (I especially enjoyed Jenifer Lewis' performance as Julia's mom and Whitney's singing), but it does tend to get a little boring, but stay with it. It is an ideal family film, though....something everyone can sit down and watch.",3,Worth watching if only to see Denzel,967248000,"08 26, 2000",2000,1942,"['Even', 'great', 'cast', 'utilized', 'here', 'Preacher', 'Wife', 'still', 'be', 'lacking', 'something', 'remake', 'old', 'movie', '1940s', 'starring', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'David', 'Niven', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'only', 'then', 'was', 'called', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'are', 'few', 'changes', 'updated', 'Christmas', 'story', 'When', 'Reverend', 'Henry', 'Biggs', 'Courtney', 'B.', 'Vance', 'doubt', 'ability', 'make', 'difference', 'community', 'even', 'doubt', 'God', 'can', 'truly', 'make', 'miracles', 'guidance', 'answer', 'prayer', 'handsome', 'angel', 'Dudley', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'sent', 'Heaven', 'help', 'restore', 'faith', 'However', 'reverend', 'not', 'buy', 'story', 'Dudley', 'was', 'actually', 'answer', 'prayers', 'even', 'sent', 'God', 'Dudley', 'here', 'help', 'preacher', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'preacher', 'wife', 'Julia', 'Whitney', 'Houston', '.The', 'story', 'still', 'point', 'reason', 'Whitney', 'terrifically', 'bored', 'whole', 'thing', 'Denzel', 'gorgeous', 'course', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'movie', 'reviewer', 'right', 'one', 'point', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'presence', 'Dudley', 'character', 'longer', 'necessary', 'reverend', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'handle', 'things', 'who', 'Denzel', 'was', 'delightful', 'watch', 'role', 'flair', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'something', 'rarely', 'see', 'majority', 'roles', 'Denzel', 'plays.Singer', 'Lionel', 'Richie', 'also', 'small', 'role', 'film', 'Julia', 'friend', 'jazz', 'pianist', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'film', 'scene', 'Julia', 'jazz', 'club', 'priceless', 'one', 'film', 'have', 'moments', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Jenifer', 'Lewis', 'performance', 'Julia', 'mom', 'Whitney', 'singing', 'tend', 'get', 'little', 'boring', 'stay', 'ideal', 'family', 'film', '.something', 'everyone', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'watch']",Preacher's Wife VHS
