998131,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000G1R38U,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[6, 6]","Akeelah Anderson must face the stigma of many talented young people:  She must flower as a person and a prodigy and still be able to be foster favor from her peers.  Labelled a ""brainiac"" by her schoolmates, Akkelah (Keke Palmer) must overcome the hurdles of peer pressure and a difficult family life to shape her own destiny.  First she must decide what she wants.  She can get straight A's on her spelling tests without trying (a fact she conceals as best she can) but she is frequently absent from school where peers are often nasty at best, and a curriculum that is hardly stimulating.  Akeelah has one close friend, Georgia, but her difficulties are daunting.  Her father was shot and killed when she was six years old.  Her eldest brother is in the service, and he encourages her to be the best she can be.  He inspires her and tells her their father would be proud of her efforts. However, her next eldest brother is a daily presence, one that is marred by trouble and gang activity.  Her mother (Angela Bassett) is harsh, yet loving. Nevertheless, her responsiblities as a single-parent mother understandably prevent her from giving Akeelah the time and support she needs.  Akeelah is drawn into her Los Angeles middle school's spelling bee after being bribed by her principal, who will give her consequences for truancy if she doesn't enter the contest.  Later, a UCLA professor (Laurence Fishburne) inspires her to want to win.  Seeming stuffy and arrogant, Dr. Larabee shows her the fundamentals of winning.  He genuinely wants her to win, but he changes her attitude and approach to winning spelling contests and learning about the lessons of life.  One of those lessons comes from a quote by Nelson Mandela, one that challenges all people to reject mediocrity and overcome the fears to do one's best.  In the end both the student and professor inspire one another.""Akeelah and the Bee"" is an emotional tour-de-force that never falters.  Viewers may be quick to dismiss ""Akeelah..., for the subject matter, but the pace of the plot and some fast-edited scenes give the movie a tension that even some of the best sports movies lack.  The movie avoids cynicism by giving us all hope through heart-warming characters like Javier, a fellow-contestant who befriends Akeelah.  Still, it is a realistic movie.  One feels the palpable racism present when she witnesses her nemesis, Dylan Chiu, getting slapped by his father for almost losing a scrabble game (""to a black girl"") played at Javier's birthday party.  The atmosphere of ""Akeelah"" is sad, funny, and uplifting, each in the right measure.The acting is exceptional throughout.  Palmer is especially adept at creating a rich and believable Akeelah.  However, the supporting cast, especially Fishburne and Bassett, are essential elements for creating a surprisingly engaging and inspiring movie.  Ignore the subject matter, ""Akkelah and the Bee"" is a terrific movie.  Don't wait until this movie comes out on DVD, you'll have a fine movie experience eliminated in the first round.",5,Akeelah is E-X-C-E-P-T-I-O-N-A-L,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,3041,"['Akeelah', 'Anderson', 'must', 'face', 'stigma', 'many', 'talented', 'young', 'people', 'must', 'flower', 'person', 'prodigy', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'foster', 'favor', 'peers', 'Labelled', 'brainiac', 'schoolmates', 'Akkelah', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'must', 'overcome', 'hurdles', 'peer', 'pressure', 'difficult', 'family', 'life', 'shape', 'own', 'destiny', 'First', 'must', 'decide', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'straight', 'A', 'spelling', 'tests', 'trying', 'fact', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'frequently', 'absent', 'school', 'where', 'peers', 'are', 'often', 'nasty', 'best', 'curriculum', 'hardly', 'stimulating', 'Akeelah', 'one', 'close', 'friend', 'Georgia', 'difficulties', 'are', 'daunting', 'father', 'was', 'shot', 'killed', 'when', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'eldest', 'brother', 'service', 'be', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'father', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'efforts', 'However', 'next', 'eldest', 'brother', 'daily', 'presence', 'one', 'marred', 'trouble', 'gang', 'activity', 'mother', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'harsh', 'yet', 'loving', 'Nevertheless', 'responsiblities', 'single-parent', 'mother', 'understandably', 'prevent', 'giving', 'Akeelah', 'time', 'support', 'Akeelah', 'drawn', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'middle', 'school', 'spelling', 'bee', 'being', 'bribed', 'principal', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'consequences', 'truancy', ""n't"", 'enter', 'contest', 'Later', 'UCLA', 'professor', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'want', 'win', 'Seeming', 'stuffy', 'arrogant', 'Dr.', 'Larabee', 'fundamentals', 'winning', 'genuinely', 'win', 'attitude', 'approach', 'winning', 'spelling', 'contests', 'learning', 'lessons', 'life', 'One', 'lessons', 'quote', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'one', 'all', 'people', 'reject', 'mediocrity', 'overcome', 'fears', 'do', 'one', 'best', 'end', 'student', 'professor', 'inspire', 'one', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'emotional', 'tour-de-force', 'never', 'Viewers', 'may', 'be', 'quick', 'dismiss', 'Akeelah', 'subject', 'matter', 'pace', 'plot', 'fast-edited', 'scenes', 'give', 'movie', 'tension', 'even', 'best', 'sports', 'movies', 'lack', 'movie', 'avoids', 'cynicism', 'giving', 'hope', 'heart-warming', 'characters', 'Javier', 'fellow-contestant', 'who', 'Akeelah', 'Still', 'realistic', 'movie', 'One', 'palpable', 'racism', 'present', 'when', 'nemesis', 'Dylan', 'Chiu', 'getting', 'slapped', 'father', 'almost', 'losing', 'scrabble', 'game', 'black', 'girl', 'played', 'Javier', 'birthday', 'party', 'atmosphere', 'Akeelah', 'sad', 'funny', 'uplifting', 'right', 'measure.The', 'acting', 'exceptional', 'Palmer', 'especially', 'adept', 'creating', 'rich', 'believable', 'Akeelah', 'However', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'Fishburne', 'Bassett', 'are', 'essential', 'elements', 'creating', 'surprisingly', 'engaging', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', 'Akkelah', 'Bee', 'terrific', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'movie', 'out', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fine', 'movie', 'experience', 'eliminated', 'first', 'round']",N/A
998132,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,B000G1R38U,AbeStreet,"[2, 2]","We've all seen movies about underdogs and their struggles to beat the odds.  When AKEELAH AND THE BEE first hit the theaters I made the mistake of thinking that this movie was just another run of the mill ""underdog"" movie, I was wrong.  Just recently, after several positive reviews from family & friends, I finally saw the film on DVD.  I was greatly surprised at how much I began to care for the characters in this film.  In my opinion, the main characters quest to become the national spelling bee champion takes second place to the way her character, and the characters of those around her, evolve.  The problems she faces are common to most people, both children and adult.  I think the film correctly shows that overcoming obstacles and hardships can rarely be done alone. Acknowledging the need for support and accepting the help of a support network benefits not only the individual but those that make up the support network.  I think the film correctly shows that the quest of an underdog can provided a rewarding experience, regardless of the final result of the quest.  I loved the poem by Marianne Williamson, ""Our Deepest Fear"".  This poem is beautiful, it not only describes the character of Akeelah perfectly but correctly points out the people in general should approach their own personal fears.Lions Gate is a film company that grasps, in my opinion, what many major film studios seem to have trouble doing.  Lions Gate may pump out action films but also recognizes that all films need not have fancy effects, explosions and hundreds of millions of dollars on actors, sets and FX.  Sometimes all people want is a simple story that is well written, well acted and well directed.  This film was made for 6 million dollars and still had well known performers in it.  I applaud Laurence Fishburne & Angela Bassett, two well established performers that are probably capable of jointly receiving movie salaries greater than the entire production cost of this film, for taking an obvious pay cut to lend their services to a film like this.  All the child performers were excellent.  I have to acknowledge KeKe Palme, she really shined in the title role.I realize no movie will appeal to all viewers but this one will appeal to most.

998133,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000G1R38U,A Customer,"[29, 30]","Akeelah And the Bee is so warm and heart-wrenching, so full of power and emotion that you can forgive the film for being formulaic and deliberately tugging at the heartstrings. Featuring a truly bravura performance by the young Keke Palmer is Akeelah, this film is one of the best feel-good family movies to come along in years and certainly one of the best films of 2006.Akeelah (Palmer) is an 11-year-old sixth-grader at Crenshaw Middle School in South Los Angeles, she's bright  - she even aces all the class spelling tests - but she has a bit of an attitude problem, partly caused by the unmotivated feeling of those around her, and the idea that to be intelligent is not considered ""cool.""But deep down Akeelah loves words and it's something she shared with her late father. Avella's mom, Tanya (Angela Bassett), is too busy trying to keep her life and family together to pay much attention. She has one young son flirting with being a gangbanger and another son is doing well in the Air Force, so Tanya just doesn't want to be bothered with what she views as the foolishness of spelling competitions.Spurred on by the school principal (Curtis Armstrong) Akeelah is encouraged to enter the Crenshaw school spelling bee, even though she doesn't really want to do it. She of course wins, and but she's going to need help if she wants to make it through other contests. She finds a mentor in the somber Dr. Larabee (Lawrence Fishburne) who is on sabbatical from his position as chairman of the UCLA English department and has a lot of time on his hands.From the outset these two very different people are destined to clash. He views her as insolent; and she sees no reason to be interested in the broader cultural education he wants her to master in addition to spelling. However, they soon warm to each other and Akeelah immerses herself in the world of spelling where she meets fellow contestants Javier (J.R. Villarreal) is a gregarious Latino with supportive parents and the mechanical Dylan (Sean Michael Afable) who is being pressured to win the Bee by his humorless and stern Asian American father.Will Akeelah make it to the National Spelling Bee in Washington? And will Tanya eventually come around and support her daughter's efforts? The evolving relationship between Akeelah and her mentor forms the core of this movie, as Dr. Larabee tries to temper Akeelah's fears.But the biggest surprise comes at the end where writer-director Doug Atchison surprisingly deviates from the tried and true formula. The outcome depends not on who will win the bee, necessarily - but on the moral and ethical choices that our young heroine makes.Atchison occasionally piles on the melodrama a bit thick, but he gets away with it because his cast is so good, especially the young Keke Palmer, who should indeed get an Oscar nomination for this. You expect nothing but emotional truth and top-notch performances from Fishburne and Bassett, but it's the young Palmer who wins your heart with a feat of acting that's so completely honest and free of affectation.

998139,AK0CENM3LUM28,B000G1R38U,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Akeelah and the Bee / B000G1R394*Spoiler*A good contrast toBee Season, ""Akeelah and the Bee"" concerns yet another young, neglected girl who finds herself in a spelling bee and hopes to knit her family and community together through her remarkable talent. In many ways, however, the similarities end here, as Akeelah - unlike Eliza - does not even want to be in the spelling bee, despite her love of words and spelling. Akeelah feels trapped in a community that does not seem to openly value displays of intelligence, and she feels trapped in a family where her mother is kinder and more loving to her sister (a young mother) and her brother (a delinquent) than she is to her well-mannered, intelligent daughter.This, I think, is one failing of ""Akeelah"" - for the first half of the movie, the mother is so over-the-top vile that she seems intent on edging out the role in the next ""Mommy Dearest"" production. ""Bee Season"" dealt with overbearing, authoritative parents, too, but did so as part of the plot - the father was the main source of antagonism, albeit subtly. Here, however, the authoritarian mother is just a simple challenge obstacle, and once the plot passes over the mid-point challenge, she transforms instantly into a warm, loving, saintly single mother. There's nothing terribly wrong with movie transformations like this, but some middle-ground would have been nicer.As Akeelah trains and gains confidence for the bee, she comes to realize that her entire neighborhood really is rooting for her to succeed - that they all are terribly proud of her ability to stand out. A nice contrast to ""Bee Season"", where Eliza trains locked up daily with her father, Akeelah instead seeks out friends and tutors - learning from the other spellers, and training with flash cards with family and friends. Akeelah's coach, a spectacularly neurotic Laurence Fishburne, warms to his spunky student and comes to realize that he has at least as much to learn from her as she from him.All in all, I really enjoyed ""Akeelah and the Bee"". If you're looking for an entertaining, heartwarming, and fun-for-the-whole-family drama, you could do a lot worse than ""Akeelah"". Above all else, I have to give the movie points for the spectacular ending, which deftly avoided the stereotypical ending that children's competition movies often have.

And for this, perhaps surprisingly, we have to give credit to the director.  Surprisingly because the director and screenwriter in this film are the same person.If it weren't for the unbeatable charm and charisma of the actors, this film would have no legs at all.  The story, which everybody knows by now, shows very little originality.  The ""coming to terms with your past"" subplot lifts what would otherwise be trite to the merely ordinary.Atchison's sense as a director and his abilities to draw out emotion and depth in his actors are wonderful.  So wonderful in fact that I wish he'd given his script over to someone who could have made it interesting.  I look forward to his future work as a director in which he leaves the writing to others.Saying this is great for the under 15 set is to a degree a bit condescending to that demographic.  Teens know better than many adults when they're being manipulated.  It's quite possible to make a movie that is about young people but appealing to all age groups, and movies that do so are more honest than those that go the after school special route that this one drifts into.Just in case I wasn't clear, Keke Palmer gives a wonderful performance, and we have a lot to look forward to in her future work.

""brnn64""","[1, 1]","At first, this would seem like a typical against-all odds themed films that you've all seen before, but there is more depth to this than that. Emotionally complex and gratifying tale of a young girl in the ghetto who overcomes to try to be a spelling champ.What I found interesting is not only the complex relationship she has with Laurence Fishburne (in one of his best roles) as her mentor and his fascinating (and unexpected) motives in helping the unrelated Akeelah, and the friendship and comraderie she develops with an Asian and Latino competitor (the former's relationship with his father is a subject for another movie itself),.But one really stereotype-shattering scene in the film that fascinated me more than anything else is when Akeelah's wannabe drug-dealing gangster brother riducules her. The older drug dealer that her brother looks up to puts a stop to this and encourages Akeelah. I loved this because it shows a seldom-seen aspect of ghetto life-even hardcore thugs sometimes want to see kids take another path than what they have chosen. Having experienced this myself as a child, this scene gave this movie an addded icing to the top for me! The way the neighborhood puts a lot of hope into Akeelah and rallies around the child as a symbol of the possible is moving beyond words.Imagine Jimmy Stewart coming back as a preteen African-American girl and you get the idea.

If anyone ever tells you that a film about a spelling bee must be boring or worthless has never seen this film, I can guarantee you that much.  Doug Atchison beautifully captures heart and soul in this fantastic drama featuring an awards worthy performance by its young star Keke Palmer.The film moves along briskly and is completely engrossing from start to finish and just an utter delight to watch.  As much has been said for Palmer's brilliant performance should be said for the script, direction and film as a whole.  Everything is top notch and effortless.  The script is tight and entertaining, fresh and believable.  The characters for the most part are fleshed out properly, the film itself coming off very polished and detailed just right.Palmer plays young Akeelah Anderson, your typical young teen trying to find herself.  She lives in a not so wonderful part of town and goes to a not so wonderful type of school.  But Akeelah is special.  She has talent and a love for learning, especially for words, a talent and love that are hard to find in the area in which she is growing up.  With a little push Akeelah is persuaded to take a hold of her talent and turn it into something very good, not just for her but for her community as a whole.  Palmer invests so much spunk and charm into Akeelah that the audience can't help but fall in love with her with each passing scene.  As Akeelah trains and then eventually competes in the Scripps National Spelling Bee we are intertwined in her life and love every minute of it.To me, the only downfall to `Akeelah and the Bee' is Laurence Fishburne who doesn't seem to play any character apart from Morpheous.  He's way too serious, so serious that even his cracked smiles and laughs appear forced and harsh.  I found him hard to watch.  He comes off very actorly, very technical and overtly dramatic.  Angela Bassett at times finds herself in the same boat, but she's able to pull herself out of it enough to make her character a little more real and relatable.  Don't read me wrong, Fishburne is far from enough reason to skip the movie all together, but he is my one critique.  Apart from his performance I adored the movie.  It's a great family film with heart and it teaches valuable lessons for children and parents alike.  It's a pure joy and a film that will touch just about everyone.",5,"Family film with all the right touches, heart, soul and charm...",1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,2700,"['Well', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'initially', 'jumped', 'chance', 'see', 'raves', 'poured', 'wife', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'end', 'day', 'credits', 'rolling', 'smiles', 'plastered', 'have', 'come', 'conclusion', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'was', 'genuine', 'surprise', 'good', 'great', 'one', 'anyone', 'ever', 'film', 'spelling', 'bee', 'must', 'be', 'boring', 'worthless', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'can', 'guarantee', 'much', 'Doug', 'Atchison', 'beautifully', 'heart', 'soul', 'fantastic', 'drama', 'featuring', 'awards', 'worthy', 'performance', 'young', 'star', 'Keke', 'Palmer.The', 'film', 'moves', 'briskly', 'completely', 'engrossing', 'start', 'finish', 'just', 'utter', 'delight', 'watch', 'much', 'been', 'said', 'Palmer', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'script', 'direction', 'film', 'whole', 'Everything', 'top', 'notch', 'effortless', 'script', 'tight', 'entertaining', 'fresh', 'believable', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'properly', 'film', 'coming', 'off', 'very', 'polished', 'detailed', 'just', 'right.Palmer', 'plays', 'young', 'Akeelah', 'Anderson', 'typical', 'young', 'teen', 'trying', 'find', 'not', 'so', 'wonderful', 'part', 'town', 'not', 'so', 'wonderful', 'type', 'school', 'Akeelah', 'special', 'talent', 'love', 'learning', 'especially', 'words', 'talent', 'love', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'area', 'growing', 'up', 'little', 'push', 'Akeelah', 'persuaded', 'take', 'hold', 'talent', 'turn', 'something', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'just', 'community', 'whole', 'Palmer', 'so', 'much', 'spunk', 'charm', 'Akeelah', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'passing', 'scene', 'Akeelah', 'trains', 'then', 'eventually', 'Scripps', 'National', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'are', 'intertwined', 'life', 'love', 'minute', 'it.To', 'only', 'downfall', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'play', 'character', 'apart', 'Morpheous', 'way', 'too', 'serious', 'so', 'serious', 'even', 'cracked', 'smiles', 'laughs', 'appear', 'forced', 'harsh', 'found', 'hard', 'watch', 'off', 'very', 'actorly', 'very', 'technical', 'overtly', 'dramatic', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'times', 'finds', 'same', 'boat', 'able', 'pull', 'enough', 'make', 'character', 'little', 'more', 'real', 'relatable', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'wrong', 'Fishburne', 'far', 'enough', 'reason', 'skip', 'movie', 'together', 'one', 'critique', 'Apart', 'performance', 'adored', 'movie', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'heart', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'children', 'parents', 'alike', 'pure', 'joy', 'film', 'will', 'touch', 'just', 'everyone']",N/A

Not to mention all the big words.It probably single-handedly boosted National spelling bee attendance.  It was that powerful.Keke Palmer's performance was palpable; you could feel what it was to be in her shoes.  Scared of rejection, or worse, she downplayed her intelligence.  Her mother, portrayed by Angela Bassett,  couldn't see it, because Akeelah was always getting in trouble, plus mama had other things on her mind.  Akeelah seemed to get lost in the shuffle, until she was forced to participate in a school spelling bee to avoid suspension.  Her performance there caught the principal's attention, and he brought in Lawrence Fishburne's Dr. Larabee, a former champion speller himself.The cool thing about this movie was that it didn't play up a whole natural ability angle on spelling, or intellectual giftedness.  It gave credit where it was due--in hard work.  Akeelah's biggest competition worked harder than them all; it was not left up to talent.  That, and admitting that success was the ultimate goal is what made this movie soar.It was beautiful to see a story unfold with real characters, and not weighed down with sex or eroticism.  That would have been inappropriate.  This was a movie the whole family could enjoy together, and actually learn something--besides how to spell antidisestablishmentarianism.

The initial flavor is encouraging, but that aftertaste... whew! As Akeelah, Keke Palmer is little short of a marvel. She has great presence, and she communicates the little quirks of her personality without being showy about it. In short, she's irresistible, and that's a good thing, because this storyline's pretty formulaic.AKEELAH AND THE BEE's tagline is ""Changing the world, one word at a time."" Fair enough, though when the word in question might be something like ""soliterraneous,"" one anticipates a big change coming... So, what kind of changes are talking about here? Writer/director Doug Atchison (a white guy, natch) doesn't leave much to our imagination in this respect. The story is set in an African American neighborhood in South Central L.A., and when Akeelah's brother gives her the spelling word ""e-n-f-r-a-n-c-h-I-s-e-m-e-n-t,"" I sort of got the idea.So what's working against AKEELAH AND THE BEE? Believability. There is a music video ""training"" sequence before the big bee where Akeelah is getting quizzed by every demographic in the `hood, from the gang-bangers to the Korean grocer. It's enjoyable as a laughable pastiche, because taking it seriously would have snapped my credulity like  a dehydrated kookaburra.

Akeelah is being harassed at school by those who notice her differences. They call her ""freak"" and demand she do their English homework. So when principal Welch (Curtis Armstrong) pressures Akeelah into the school's spelling bee contest, our young heroine is less than willing. She doesn't want others to call her names, too, or gain any sort of confirmation that she's ""different"". But Akeelah has talent. Her mind is a sponge. She just needs the right motivation to set her on the path of self discovery.Enter Dr. Larabee (Laurence Fishburn), a retired UCLA professor. He's also experienced loss not long ago. His young daughter died and his wife left him. So when Akeelah shows up, he's less than accepting of her. But the two form a teacher/student relationship and quickly learn much about each other ...above and beyond spelling words.Dr. Larabee helps launch Akeelah toward the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington DC (aired on ESPN), and it is here that we see Akeelah's talents take wing. Battling over 100 other contestants, Akeelah has deeper motivations at the tournament than just winning.Although smaltzy and predictable, Akeelah and the Bee has a great message: not denying who you are. The typical hero's journey infuses the script, something we've seen millions of times (from ROCKY to HARRY POTTER). But the shining light for the film is young Keke herself. Her emotional range is astonishing for such a young actress, playing right up to the level of co-stars Bassett and Fishburn.Without a doubt, the documentary SPELLBOUND aided in this movie's success. And although Spellbound had a lot more realism in it, Akeelah and the Bee matches it well from a fictionalized perspective.This film's a winner even with its predictability and common plot.",4,Keke Rules The Show,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,2557,"['Learning', 'like', 'one', 'toughest', 'things', 'do', 'Becoming', 'good', 'great', 'natural', 'talents', 'should', 'be', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'Such', 'life', 'lesson', 'AKEELAH', 'THE', 'BEE.When', '11-year-old', 'Akeelah', 'Anderson', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'homework', 'English', 'class', 'always', 'high', 'grade', 'even', 'rarely', 'studies', 'so', 'Prior', 'shooting', 'death', 'father', 'had', 'instilled', 'love', 'language', 'challenging', 'Scrabble', 'often', 'picture', 'propped', 'desk', 'reminder', 'pleasant', 'times', 'pleasant', 'times', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'Anderson', 'household', 'time', 'Tanya', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'full', 'time', 'trying', 'support', 'children', 'one', 'being', 'sucked', 'world', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Akeelah', 'being', 'harassed', 'school', 'who', 'notice', 'differences', 'call', 'freak', 'demand', 'do', 'English', 'homework', 'So', 'when', 'principal', 'Welch', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'Akeelah', 'school', 'spelling', 'bee', 'contest', 'young', 'heroine', 'less', 'willing', ""n't"", 'want', 'others', 'call', 'names', 'too', 'gain', 'sort', 'confirmation', 'different', 'Akeelah', 'talent', 'mind', 'sponge', 'just', 'right', 'motivation', 'set', 'path', 'self', 'discovery.Enter', 'Dr.', 'Larabee', 'Laurence', 'Fishburn', 'retired', 'UCLA', 'professor', 'also', 'experienced', 'loss', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'young', 'daughter', 'died', 'wife', 'left', 'So', 'when', 'Akeelah', 'up', 'less', 'accepting', 'two', 'form', 'teacher/student', 'relationship', 'quickly', 'learn', 'much', 'other', 'spelling', 'words.Dr', 'Larabee', 'launch', 'Akeelah', 'Scripps', 'National', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'Washington', 'DC', 'aired', 'ESPN', 'here', 'see', 'Akeelah', 'talents', 'take', 'wing', 'Battling', '100', 'other', 'contestants', 'Akeelah', 'deeper', 'motivations', 'tournament', 'just', 'winning.Although', 'smaltzy', 'predictable', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'great', 'message', 'not', 'denying', 'who', 'are', 'typical', 'hero', 'journey', 'script', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'millions', 'times', 'ROCKY', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'shining', 'light', 'film', 'young', 'Keke', 'emotional', 'range', 'astonishing', 'young', 'actress', 'playing', 'right', 'level', 'co-stars', 'Bassett', 'Fishburn.Without', 'doubt', 'documentary', 'SPELLBOUND', 'aided', 'movie', 'success', 'Spellbound', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'realism', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'matches', 'well', 'fictionalized', 'perspective.This', 'film', 'winner', 'even', 'predictability', 'common', 'plot']",N/A

I agree with him...it is formulaic and predictable.  But formats such as this become formulaic because people enjoy these stories.  We watch a character rise above their station, overcome obstacles, find their true worth, triumph in the end, and we love it.  In those stories, which find their origins in Homeric epics, we find hope.  Who couldn't use a little hope?The performances are wonderful.  The supporting roles of Javier, Dylan, and Georgia were very capably executed by J.P Villareal, Sean Michael, and Sahara Gray.  Villareal's Javier was an endearing geek with a very wholesome crush on Akeelah.  Michael's Dylan was a meaty character; a reluctant overachiever suffering at the hands of a father too obsessed with winning.  Gray's Georgia was the best friend who felt left behind when Akeelah began hitting the big time.  That role practically begs for overacting, but Sahara Gray handled it with professional understatement.  Less was more.Now to the principals.  Two megawatt stars stars graced this film, Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett.  Both of these strong performers created credible, consistent, identifiable characters.  Both characters went through metamorphoses that were completely believable.  So, the central Akeelah character is not the sole source of inspiration in this film.  I only wish there were more scenes (and perhaps a little subplot) for these two actors, who showed us such amazing screen chemistry in ""What's Love Got To Do With It?"".Now, it obviously takes a special talent to share the spotlight with Fishburne and Bassett.  Keke Palmer rose to the occasion.  She was brilliant, and clearly has a bright future in acting.  The Akeelah character is demanding, as she has to create solid and clear relationships with literally everyone else in the film.  Palmer was convincing and fully committed to her artistic choices.  I wish her happiness, good health, and the strength to avoid the poor choices that so many young and promising stars have made.

I was never in it, but I think it takes a great amount of many things to spell into that microphone in front of America when you know that you may not be victorious.I put this movie on not expecting much; just something to pass the time. I was in for a real treat. I have watched dramas before (like ""Footloose"" or ""Fried Green Tomatoes""), and there are some that I do not like. However, there are some, like ""Little Man Tate"" that just leave you crying at the end. Well, ""Akeelah and the bee"" has just become my second favorite movie of all time. Let me tell you a little about it and who to see in it.It is about an 11-year-old girl named Akeelah (played by Keke Palmer) who spells because it eases the pain caused by the death of her father when she was younger. Her mother, Tanya Anderson (played by Angela Bassett), is trying to keep the family of Akeelah and her brothers together as best she could, which is hard to do because she is poor and has no help. Enter Dr. Larabee (played by Laurence Fishburne) who helps to coach the one area Akeelah is good at: spelling. However, the big question is, will Akeelah win the spelling bees?There is plenty of intense drama. I think that anyone who likes to spell or wishes to participate in any type of spelling activity (be it a spelling bee, spelling quiz, or Scrabble game/tournament) should make this movie a must see.So, do me a favor: spell ""preeminent"". If you said A-K-E-E-L-A-H, then you are correct!Oh, and this movie was directed by Doug Atchison. It is not a true story, however there are many parts in it that many people could, and probably would, relate to. You could also go to a Starbucks and get this film as they helped to make it.

This is why I watch movies, hoping that such inspiration and character shows up in the final assembly.I could truly see every aspect of this movie happening in real life.  Keke Palmer (Akeelah) plays her role so well that she almost made this movie seem like a documentary.  That's not an easy task.  And she is from Harvey, Illinois!  I've been there!  I know that place.  That makes it all the more exciting to see a girl from Harvey starring on the silver screen.  I pray that her career blossoms from this point on, and that this will be proof that anyone can make it big.Laurence Fishburne plays Dr. Larabee - a character that could have come across as an After-School-Special part - with amazing strength and ability.  Fishburne always delivers the goods, so I shouldn't be surprised that he does it again in this movie.  I loved the way his character was able to motivate Akeelah to see through the fog that surrounded her understanding of the world around her.Angela Bassett plays Akeelah's single mother, determined to lift her family above the environment surrounding them.  Talk about a woman who looks like she exercises a lot; she got guns!  Okay, I know that has nothing to do with her acting in the movie, but I had to mention that.Bassett is very convincing as the concerned parent worrying about the direction Akeelah is headed.  Most parents struggle with letting their child have freedom and keeping them safe from the evils that can come upon them.  I felt Bassett balanced the two sides well in her work.Curtis Armstrong plays Mr. Welch, in what I consider one of the best performances of his career.  Having discovered Akeelah's amazing talent, Welch wants to build on this ability while at the same time prove to the surrounding community that his school has the ability to perform.  He balances his concern for Akeelah and his need to promote the school throughout the movie.  This role could not have been easy, so I give him a lot of respect for even tackling one of the most difficult characters in the movie.  His performance lifted Akeelah well above that After-School-Special status I talked about earlier.J.R.

Her widowed mother (Angela Bassett) is a nurse, just trying to keep her household together, as well as balancing a full time job with her motherly responsiblities (this includes keeping Akeelah's older brother out of illegal and dangerous extracurricular activities).Akeelah's talent lies in her ability to memorize (literally) every word in the dictionary, as well as her indomitable spirit.

998177,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000G1R38U,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","There is hardly a plot development you don't see coming in this 2006 film, yet in spite of the odds, it has to be one of the most rewarding family films of recent vintage. Written and directed by relative newcomer Doug Atchison, this academic variation on the standard underdog movie takes flight due to sterling performances from the three leads and a well-paced story not inordinately preoccupied with conveying social messages. I have to imagine that parts of Atchison's final script were inspired by the winning 2002 documentary, ""Spellbound"", which tracks eight finalists in the national spelling bee. In fact, the central story reminds me of one of them, Ashley White, an optimistic girl who lives in the D.C. projects with her single mother.The plot in this movie focuses on 11-year old Akeelah Anderson, an under-motivated but obviously gifted child living in scarifying South Central LA. Wanting to fit in with her schoolmates, she resists entering the school spelling bee despite the encouragement of her teacher and principal. When she does, her mind is sparked by her own possibilities, even though her distracted, tough-minded mother is suspicious of this new interest. The principal has convinced a testy academic, Dr. Larrabee, to coach Akeelah, and his training regimen involves tough-love tactics and jump rope. It turns out he has emotional baggage, which spurs her to elicit the help of the community in one of those corny, everyone-lends-a-hand montage sequences that shouldn't work but does.There is even a puppy-level romance with a friendly, supportive competitor, Javier, and more predictably, a simmering friction with the bee favorite Dylan, who has to deal with an uncompromising father. You know that this all leads to the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C. With the multi-ethnic composition of the contestants, the bee turns out to be something of the flip side to ""Crash"". It's enough for me to say when Akeelah spells her final word, it is the most profoundly touching moment in the entire movie. I have to admit it made me cry perhaps because I was a regional spelling bee contestant in my youth.Reunited a dozen years after their memorably blazing work as Ike and Tina Turner in ""What's Love Got to Do With It?"", Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett appear to have switched roles this time, as he is the tortured soul and she is the fiery-tempered force to be reckoned with. However, both bring depth and nuance to their somewhat pat roles. More importantly, they understandably take a backseat to the effervescent Keke Palmer, quite a find as Akeelah. She delivers a beguiling performance that never rings false, and you can't help but root for her all the way.The DVD has the standard set of extras, though surprisingly Atchison and the principals do not provide a separate audio commentary track. There is a 22-minute, making-of featurette that does provide insight, in particular Atchison's decade-long struggle to get the film made and then only on a shoestring budget of $6 million and a tight, 31-day shooting schedule. Excerpts from interviews with Fishburne, Bassett and Palmer are included. There are two shorts focused on Palmer - ""Two Peas in a Pod"" about the close relationship that developed between Atchison and Palmer, and ""Inside the Mind of Akeelah"" which shows the more technical direction Atchison gave Palmer to elicit various emotional responses.Of less value are a gag reel and the deleted scenes, all too brief to provide real impact except for a flashback scene where Akeelah remembers her mother's visceral reaction to a family tragedy (powerful but a wise cut).

For those of you who aren't familiar with filmmaking lingo this means that starbucks footed the bill (or at least part of it). That was a good move. This is an excellent film to begin your producing portfolio.This movie is very similar to ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" it just has spelling instead of chess. Lawrence Fishburne even plays the coach character again. Basic plot: A young black girl from Los Angeles tries to make it to the National Spelling Bee. That's it. Seems simple enough, and it is. The plot plays out pretty much how you would expect. It contains all the characters you would expect to see in a film like this. You have the mysterious but effective coach (who is usually played by Lawrence Fishburne anyway in movies like this), you have the reluctant mother, you have the arch rival and his overbearing father, and a collection of bullies from family and school. In spite of all this the film is quite good.You might think that a movie about spelling would be boring, but it isn't. It is a new twist on a theme we have seen many times before. The characters are great. Akeelahs friend Javier is one of the greatest characters I have seen in a while. He absolutely stole a scene where he is stalls for time at a spelling bee. I especially liked Eddie Steeples (Crabman from ""My name is Earl"") turn as the shady drug dealer(?) character. I thought it was very clever to have a character who is bad by societies standards but still has some good intentions for other people. Why wouldn't a drug dealer root for a little girl to win a spelling bee? Even drug dealers have feelings, but most movies don't portray them that way.I feel like the thing that set this film apart from others is that Akeelah really has compassion for other people. In ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"", Joshua Waitzkin offers his rival a draw, but you get the feeling he is just doing it because he feels it is the right thing for a chess player to do under the circumstances, and not because he feels any sense of compassion for the other boy. This is not at all the case with Akeelah. Akeelah is very empathetic towards the people she comes in contact with, and it makes for a different dynamic than most normal films.I do think that this film is riding the wave of the spelling bee craze in the USA right now, but it is a good film so I don't mind.My rating: 4 of 5",4,Excellent film,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,2411,"['was', 'first', 'movie', 'ever', 'produced', 'Starbucks', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'filmmaking', 'lingo', 'starbucks', 'footed', 'bill', 'least', 'part', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'excellent', 'film', 'begin', 'producing', 'portfolio.This', 'movie', 'very', 'similar', 'Searching', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'just', 'spelling', 'instead', 'chess', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'even', 'coach', 'character', 'again', 'Basic', 'plot', 'young', 'black', 'girl', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'make', 'National', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'simple', 'enough', 'plot', 'out', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'would', 'expect', 'characters', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'film', 'have', 'mysterious', 'effective', 'coach', 'who', 'usually', 'played', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'anyway', 'movies', 'have', 'reluctant', 'mother', 'have', 'arch', 'rival', 'overbearing', 'father', 'collection', 'bullies', 'family', 'school', 'spite', 'film', 'quite', 'good.You', 'might', 'think', 'movie', 'spelling', 'would', 'be', 'boring', ""n't"", 'new', 'twist', 'theme', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'Akeelahs', 'friend', 'Javier', 'one', 'greatest', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'absolutely', 'stole', 'scene', 'where', 'stalls', 'time', 'spelling', 'bee', 'especially', 'liked', 'Eddie', 'Steeples', 'Crabman', 'name', 'Earl', 'turn', 'shady', 'drug', 'dealer', 'character', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'have', 'character', 'who', 'bad', 'societies', 'standards', 'still', 'good', 'intentions', 'other', 'people', 'Why', 'would', ""n't"", 'drug', 'dealer', 'root', 'little', 'girl', 'win', 'spelling', 'bee', 'Even', 'drug', 'dealers', 'have', 'feelings', 'most', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'portray', 'way.I', 'feel', 'thing', 'set', 'film', 'apart', 'others', 'Akeelah', 'really', 'compassion', 'other', 'people', 'Searching', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'Joshua', 'Waitzkin', 'rival', 'draw', 'get', 'feeling', 'just', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'chess', 'player', 'do', 'circumstances', 'not', 'sense', 'compassion', 'other', 'boy', 'not', 'case', 'Akeelah', 'Akeelah', 'very', 'empathetic', 'people', 'contact', 'different', 'dynamic', 'most', 'normal', 'films.I', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'riding', 'wave', 'spelling', 'bee', 'craze', 'USA', 'right', 'now', 'good', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind.My', 'rating', '4', '5']",N/A

Yes, it is predictable, heavy on emotional melodrama, tailored to tug at the heartstrings, etc.  But because of the commitment of writer/director Doug Atchison and because of an amazingly solid cast it simply works.  Hooray for positive films!Akeelah Anderson (Keke Parker in an impressive serious acting role) lives in the Crenshaw area of Los Angeles with her nurse-who-wanted-to-be-a-doctor mother (Angela Bassett) and siblings with their own problems.  Akeelah is a gifted speller but fears letting this fact be known for fear of ridicule by her peers.  Her principal (Curtis Armstrong) catches wind of her gift, and encourages her to enter a spelling bee, an attempt to raise the standard of his failing school system.  He engages his old school chum Dr. Larabee (Laurence Fishburne), who has left his post of professor at UCLA, to be her coach.  The relationship  between these two damaged people forms the nidus for Akeelah to eventually become committed to preparing for the National Spelling Bee in Washington, DC, having won the local and divisional bees.  Despite her mother's intial objections, Akeelah wanders out of her disastrous neighborhood into the Valley where she encounters the friendship of Javier (J.R. Villarreal, another fine young actor) and the two bond and commit to winning the bee.The road to the Final Spelling Bee competition is paved with numerous stumbling blocks, both between Akeelah and Dr. Larabee and among Akeelah and her family and friends, but eventually the big moment comes and Atchison has the good sense to create an ending that comes as a surprise, one that emphasizes all the right principals without selling out.  Parker, Fishburne, Bassett and Villareal give solid performances.  The DVD includes many featurettes that explain the history of the making of the film, the relationship between producers and director, and the touching relationship between Atchison and Parker.  Does the film set any new precedents in cinema? No, but it is a joy to see a well-crafted film avoid the obvious problems of telling a much-used story in such a convincing manner.  It is a fine little film.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","Every year, ESPN televises the Scripps National Spelling Bee and it's always compelling to watch these kids undergo the pressure and perform under the spotlight. I had a feeling that I was going to like AKEELAH AND THE BEE, and that feeling was tremendously borne out with the film's uplifting underdog storyline. AKEELAH AND THE BEE is dramatic, engrossing, and it mostly hits all the right notes; don't be too surprised if the emotional finale will have you whooping it up and shedding a few joyful tears. It's a great movie, and it showcases a quite brilliant performance by young actress Keke Palmer.She plays Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old African-American girl who has a talent for spelling but who's just trying to fit in and survive in the embattled Crenshaw Middle School. Her teachers become aware of her spelling prowess and convince her to enter in the school spelling bee, which she handily wins. The rest of the movie tells of her underdog ascension past the district and the regional competitions and finally into the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Along the way, we witness Akeelah overcoming her self-doubts, thanks, in large part, to the tutelage of an English professor (Laurence Fishburne) and the friendship of a 12-year-old boy from Woodland Hills, with whom she shares a love for spelling.While Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett contribute greatly, there's no doubt at all that the star of the movie is Keke Palmer, whose wonderfully expressive face manages to convey a wide array of emotions. Every second of this film, I was rooting for Akeelah. There was a chance that certain sequences - involving Akeelah's community becoming fully invested with Akeelah and her chances at the Bee - might've become too syrupy, but these scenes are handled well enough. And, as I've mentioned,  if you don't feel a lump in your throat at the climax (pat though it may have been), well, then...you just might be dead inside.Now, before I send this out, I'm going to spell-check everything...",5,Root for Akeelah!,1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,2007,"['year', 'ESPN', 'Scripps', 'National', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'always', 'compelling', 'watch', 'kids', 'undergo', 'pressure', 'perform', 'spotlight', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'AKEELAH', 'THE', 'BEE', 'feeling', 'was', 'tremendously', 'borne', 'out', 'film', 'uplifting', 'underdog', 'storyline', 'AKEELAH', 'THE', 'BEE', 'dramatic', 'engrossing', 'mostly', 'right', 'notes', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'surprised', 'emotional', 'finale', 'will', 'have', 'whooping', 'shedding', 'few', 'joyful', 'tears', 'great', 'movie', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'young', 'actress', 'Keke', 'Palmer.She', 'Akeelah', 'Anderson', '11-year-old', 'African-American', 'girl', 'who', 'talent', 'spelling', 'who', 'just', 'trying', 'fit', 'survive', 'embattled', 'Crenshaw', 'Middle', 'School', 'teachers', 'become', 'aware', 'spelling', 'prowess', 'convince', 'enter', 'school', 'spelling', 'bee', 'handily', 'rest', 'movie', 'tells', 'underdog', 'ascension', 'district', 'regional', 'competitions', 'finally', 'Scripps', 'National', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'way', 'witness', 'Akeelah', 'overcoming', 'self-doubts', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'tutelage', 'English', 'professor', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'friendship', '12-year-old', 'boy', 'Woodland', 'Hills', 'whom', 'shares', 'love', 'spelling.While', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'contribute', 'greatly', 'doubt', 'star', 'movie', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'wonderfully', 'expressive', 'face', 'manages', 'convey', 'wide', 'array', 'emotions', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'rooting', 'Akeelah', 'was', 'chance', 'certain', 'sequences', 'involving', 'Akeelah', 'community', 'becoming', 'fully', 'invested', 'Akeelah', 'chances', 'Bee', 'might', ""'ve"", 'become', 'too', 'syrupy', 'scenes', 'are', 'handled', 'well', 'enough', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'lump', 'throat', 'climax', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'then', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'dead', 'inside.Now', 'send', 'out', ""'m"", 'going', 'spell-check', 'everything']",N/A

Not only is it an enjoyable watch, but it's packed full of inspiration and life lessons that all kids need to push themselves to challenge their potencial, perhaps they can do more than they think.  The crowded theater laughed outloud as spelling competitors came to life on the screen.  The fierce competition to win brought to life the believability and querkiness that kids are made of.  I was hesitant about taking 3 boys to the theater to see a ""girlie"" movie, however, all three boys between the ages of 8 and 12 laughed and were smiling after leaving the theater.  This is a story of an impoverished black girl with a mother too busy to notice her achievements and a father who's passed who shares her love of spelling.  At times, it seems, her father is her biggest supporter, until she stumbles upon a special friend who agrees to coach her to the national finals.  As she trains for the regional and then national competitions, Akeelah finds herself making a new class of friends, unlike her limited all black school friends.  She broadens her vision to understand there aren't colors that separate friends.  Akeelah has the talent to compete as she's able to memorize thousands of word spellings, what language they're derived from, and their application, but she must learn to develop confidence to rise above her opposing competition who are spoiled with more priveledged education and opportunity.  Some of the parents of the spellers are living out their childhood dreams through their children and find that their proding only gets them so far.  There's a message for those parents here.  I loved the underdog in this story because Akeelah has nothing going for her but her will, and it proves to be enough to go up against the best in the national spelling bee.

And perhaps my review is tainted with bias, but I thought this film was great. We have been wanting to see a family film touch us this way for quite some time. This is a film about connection, and proves yet again that casting is key.I want to say that Fishburne made this movie, and I would, if it weren't for phenom Keke Palmer. Keke as Akeelah stole the limelight from seasoned veterans Laurence Fishburne and playing her mother, Angela Bassett. Bassett did a phenomenal job as well as her overworked, worrisome mother. Fishburne wowed me with his performance as a collegiate professor weighted down with a difficult past; one strikingly similar to Akeelah's path. Others pepper the screen with helpful great acting, including Friday NIGHT LIGHT's Lee Thompson Young and REVENGE OF THE NERDS Curtis Armstrong. And finally surprising performances from Akeelah's friends. The young actors did not overplay their parts like many children; they convince the audience they are just other normal kids that can spell words like djkflhsdufhis.The film does a great job of painting a picture of the rough neighborhood without going overboard like so many movies do nowadays. It was enough to know her brother ran with a bad crowd, whereas in clich&eacute; movies, her brother might have been shot or gotten into drugs. Knowing that this little girl raised to hopes of the entire neighborhood was not unrealistic, either. Many movies have given realistic accounts of East L.A.; this does a great job of showing how bad it is, without showing us how bad it is.Finally, the drama behind this film comes from its love, its friendship. By the end of the film you are sure to have a lump in your throat, you realize that each and every relationship in this film is engulfed in friendship albeit different kinds. If you've ever had a mentor, a best friend, a fresh love, a child, a lost parent, a brother, sister, a caring teacher or president, or even a friendly rivalry, you will love this movie.",4,Akeelah and the Bee is a G-o-o-d Movie!,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,2092,"['have', 'been', 'excited', 'see', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'several', 'months', 'now', 'ever', 'saw', 'first', 'trailer', 'perhaps', 'review', 'tainted', 'bias', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'family', 'film', 'touch', 'way', 'quite', 'time', 'film', 'connection', 'yet', 'again', 'casting', 'key.I', 'want', 'say', 'Fishburne', 'made', 'movie', 'would', 'were', ""n't"", 'phenom', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'Keke', 'Akeelah', 'stole', 'limelight', 'seasoned', 'veterans', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'playing', 'mother', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Bassett', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'overworked', 'worrisome', 'mother', 'Fishburne', 'wowed', 'performance', 'collegiate', 'professor', 'weighted', 'down', 'difficult', 'past', 'one', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'Akeelah', 'path', 'Others', 'screen', 'helpful', 'great', 'acting', 'including', 'Friday', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHT', 'Lee', 'Thompson', 'Young', 'REVENGE', 'OF', 'THE', 'NERDS', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'finally', 'surprising', 'performances', 'Akeelah', 'friends', 'young', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'overplay', 'parts', 'many', 'children', 'convince', 'audience', 'are', 'just', 'other', 'normal', 'kids', 'can', 'spell', 'words', 'djkflhsdufhis.The', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'painting', 'picture', 'rough', 'neighborhood', 'going', 'overboard', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'do', 'nowadays', 'was', 'enough', 'know', 'brother', 'ran', 'bad', 'crowd', 'whereas', 'clich', 'eacute', 'movies', 'brother', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'gotten', 'drugs', 'Knowing', 'little', 'girl', 'raised', 'hopes', 'entire', 'neighborhood', 'was', 'not', 'unrealistic', 'either', 'Many', 'movies', 'have', 'given', 'realistic', 'accounts', 'East', 'L.A.', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'bad', 'showing', 'how', 'bad', 'is.Finally', 'drama', 'film', 'love', 'friendship', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'sure', 'have', 'lump', 'throat', 'realize', 'relationship', 'film', 'engulfed', 'friendship', 'different', 'kinds', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'mentor', 'best', 'friend', 'fresh', 'love', 'child', 'lost', 'parent', 'brother', 'sister', 'caring', 'teacher', 'president', 'even', 'friendly', 'rivalry', 'will', 'love', 'movie']",N/A

998206,A3GTF3Q8KJ265C,B000G1R38U,K. Williams,"[1, 1]","A 14-year-old girl that inherited a love of spelling from her father who became a casualty of the inner city, is urged to represent a dilapidated school in a spelling bee. Initially self-righteous and insolent, Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) resists the assistance offered by tutor Dr. Larabee (Laurence Fishburne) who himself is struggling with a troubled past. Adding to the struggle is the lack of support by Akeelah's widowed mother Tanya (Angela Bassett).Perfectionism, near failure and exposure to the lifestyle and education offered to opponents lead Akeelah to seek out the help previously shunned. She becomes an inspiration to a community where relative advancement is usually only achieved in street gangs. As Akeelah accepts children of different races and reaches out to Dr. Larabee, he regains confidence in himself and his pupil. Realistically, Akeelah remains a product of the inner city and does not lose touch with her friends and family.Brief but unnecessary profanity is used to demonstrate how environment erodes even a gifted child. Dr. Larabee enforces a policy of no Ebonics in his presence, which helps Akeelah to improve her vocabulary while being exposed to great literary works in addition to word lists. While Keke seems perfectly cast for the part, Fishburne and Bassette turn in remarkable performances. If it weren't for the expletives, I'd give it 5 stars.Movie quote: Dr. Larabee: ""Where do you think big words come from?""

998209,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000G1R38U,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 6]","It seems we are in a renaissance of films about spelling bees, what with not only ""Akeelah and the Bee"" but also last year's ""Bee Season.""  Then there is ""The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee"" on Broadway.  I think the reason for this is clear: ESPN has been broadcasting the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee live for the past several years.  Anyone who has stumbled across this on cable has probably stopped to check it out and quickly learned all of the stock questions contestants ask regarding definitions, origin, and using words in sentences (ESPN did a nice station promo off of it as well).  Just like horse racing during Triple Crown season, people who ignore it the rest of the year can find themselves watching these kids spell words the rest could never use in a sentence, let alone spell.Eleven-year-old Akeelah (Keke Palmer) does not have much in her life and her family has its share of problems, as we learn during the course of the film, but she can spell.  She forgets to turn in her homework and is worried that the other kids will think she is a braniac if she does well in class, but she can spell.  In fact, she has never missed a word on a spelling test even though she does not study for them.  So Mr. Welch (Curtis Armstrong), the principal of her school, decides to holding their first school spelling bee so that Akeelah can go to the Regional Spelling Bee.  It would be the sort of accomplishment that a school could build on, but first Akeelah has to win.  That proves easy enough, but then a man in the crowd stands up and starts throwing bigger and bigger words at her to see what she can really do.  .The man is Dr. Larabee (Laurence Fishburne), who went to college with Welch, and who was a champion speller in his day.  A former U.C.L.A. professor he is on sabbatical, which turns out to mean he is teaching on line, and he has his own past.  He is willing to coach Akeelah his way and on his terms, but there are obstacles in terms of her family and friends, not to mention that she is entering a whole new world, not just in terms of the competition of the spelling bees but also because Larabee is teaching her to think and to become self-actualized.  Her mother, Tanya (Angela Bassett), has ignored Akeelah for too long and it takes her a while to realize that her daughter is something special.  But she is not alone in that regard and she has ample reasons for being a less than supportive mother, not the least of which is that Akeelah has already moved light years beyond Tanya.One of the strengths of this film is that we see Akeelah learn to be a better speller.  Even better, we understand what Larabee has here doing and why, so that the stage is set for the National Spelling Bee and we can really believe that she has a shot.  More importantly, writer-director Doug Atchison deals with the world in which Akeelah lives, where being smart is seen by too many as being a liability.  What becomes key is that people love winners, even if they do not understand let alone play the game.  Two of her competitors from the right side of town figure largely in the story.  Javier (J.R. Villarreal) is happy, personable, and willing to give the neophyte Akeelah some helpful hints.  But Dylan (Sean Michael) has finished second at the National Spelling Bee two years in a row and if he does not win this year his father (Tzi Ma) is going to blow a gasket.  The idea that friendship and compassion can co-exist in a world of competition might be idealistic, but I have no problem with such idealism.Actually, this movie reminds me of the original ""Rocky,"" not just because there is a nice ""training montage,"" but also because it is a movie about competition that challenges the prevailing notion of what is ment by winning.  I picked up on the key element that set up how this movie would play out, and I was hoping it would go the way that it did, so I was happy with the resolution.  Atchison also knows how to edit the actually spelling bees so that the action is speeded up while the tension remains the same.  These kids really know how to milk each moment (their version of crossing their t's and dotting their i's), and Atchison keeps things movie.  This is a movie that is going to do a lot better when it comes out on DVD than it will do in the theaters, but that is fine.  Fishburne did ""Searching for Bobby Fischer,"" and I think ""Akeelah and the Bee"" will enjoy a similar reputation.",5,"""Changing the world... one word at a time.""",1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,4442,"['are', 'renaissance', 'films', 'spelling', 'bees', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'also', 'last', 'year', 'Bee', 'Season', 'Then', '25th', 'Annual', 'Putnam', 'County', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'Broadway', 'think', 'reason', 'clear', 'ESPN', 'been', 'broadcasting', 'Scripps', 'Howard', 'National', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'live', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'Anyone', 'who', 'stumbled', 'cable', 'probably', 'stopped', 'check', 'out', 'quickly', 'learned', 'stock', 'questions', 'contestants', 'ask', 'regarding', 'definitions', 'origin', 'using', 'words', 'sentences', 'ESPN', 'did', 'nice', 'station', 'promo', 'well', 'Just', 'horse', 'racing', 'Triple', 'Crown', 'season', 'people', 'who', 'ignore', 'rest', 'year', 'can', 'find', 'watching', 'kids', 'spell', 'words', 'rest', 'could', 'never', 'use', 'sentence', 'let', 'alone', 'spell.Eleven-year-old', 'Akeelah', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'life', 'family', 'share', 'problems', 'learn', 'course', 'film', 'can', 'spell', 'turn', 'homework', 'worried', 'other', 'kids', 'will', 'think', 'braniac', 'well', 'class', 'can', 'spell', 'fact', 'never', 'missed', 'word', 'spelling', 'test', 'even', 'not', 'study', 'Mr.', 'Welch', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'principal', 'school', 'holding', 'first', 'school', 'spelling', 'bee', 'so', 'Akeelah', 'can', 'go', 'Regional', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'would', 'be', 'sort', 'accomplishment', 'school', 'could', 'build', 'first', 'Akeelah', 'win', 'easy', 'enough', 'then', 'man', 'crowd', 'up', 'throwing', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'words', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'really', 'do', '.The', 'man', 'Dr.', 'Larabee', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'went', 'college', 'Welch', 'who', 'was', 'champion', 'speller', 'day', 'former', 'U.C.L.A', 'professor', 'sabbatical', 'out', 'mean', 'teaching', 'line', 'own', 'past', 'willing', 'coach', 'Akeelah', 'way', 'terms', 'are', 'obstacles', 'terms', 'family', 'friends', 'not', 'mention', 'entering', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'not', 'just', 'terms', 'competition', 'spelling', 'bees', 'also', 'Larabee', 'teaching', 'think', 'become', 'self-actualized', 'mother', 'Tanya', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'ignored', 'Akeelah', 'too', 'long', 'while', 'realize', 'daughter', 'something', 'special', 'not', 'alone', 'regard', 'ample', 'reasons', 'being', 'less', 'supportive', 'mother', 'not', 'least', 'Akeelah', 'already', 'moved', 'light', 'years', 'Tanya.One', 'strengths', 'film', 'see', 'Akeelah', 'learn', 'be', 'better', 'speller', 'Even', 'better', 'understand', 'what', 'Larabee', 'here', 'doing', 'why', 'stage', 'set', 'National', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'can', 'really', 'believe', 'shot', 'More', 'importantly', 'writer-director', 'Doug', 'Atchison', 'deals', 'world', 'Akeelah', 'where', 'being', 'smart', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'being', 'liability', 'What', 'key', 'people', 'love', 'winners', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'let', 'alone', 'play', 'game', 'Two', 'competitors', 'right', 'side', 'town', 'figure', 'largely', 'story', 'Javier', 'J.R.', 'Villarreal', 'happy', 'personable', 'willing', 'give', 'neophyte', 'Akeelah', 'helpful', 'hints', 'Dylan', 'Sean', 'Michael', 'finished', 'second', 'National', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'two', 'years', 'row', 'not', 'win', 'year', 'father', 'Tzi', 'Ma', 'going', 'blow', 'gasket', 'idea', 'friendship', 'compassion', 'can', 'co-exist', 'world', 'competition', 'might', 'be', 'idealistic', 'have', 'problem', 'such', 'idealism.Actually', 'movie', 'original', 'Rocky', 'not', 'just', 'nice', 'training', 'montage', 'also', 'movie', 'competition', 'prevailing', 'notion', 'what', 'ment', 'winning', 'picked', 'up', 'key', 'element', 'set', 'up', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'go', 'way', 'did', 'was', 'happy', 'resolution', 'Atchison', 'also', 'how', 'edit', 'actually', 'spelling', 'bees', 'so', 'action', 'speeded', 'up', 'tension', 'same', 'kids', 'really', 'know', 'how', 'milk', 'moment', 'version', 'crossing', 't', 'dotting', 'i', 'Atchison', 'things', 'movie', 'movie', 'going', 'do', 'lot', 'better', 'when', 'out', 'DVD', 'will', 'do', 'theaters', 'fine', 'Fishburne', 'did', 'Searching', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'think', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'will', 'enjoy', 'similar', 'reputation']",N/A

Bravim,"[2, 2]","Akeelah charms audience with wit and heartAkeelah and the Beehad the misfortune to come out near the same time asBee Seasonand several documentaries relating to the Scripps National Spelling Bee, covered annually by ESPN. Akeelah plays on the same clich&eacute;s that govern other films based on competition, but it does so in a more endearing way. The title character is a middle school student in inner-city Los Angeles. She aces every spelling test without trying. School comes so easy for her, she does not always make it to class and still make the honor roll.More difficult for Akeelah is her home life. Angela Basset portrays her mother, working odd hours and unable to be there for her children when they could use parental guidance. Her father was killed, leaving the family almost parentless. The only adults that seem to believe in her is the white school principal excited to have one of his students succeed at anything, let alone a national tournament; and a former UCLA professor (Laurence Fishburne) who just happens to live in the same neighborhood as the spelling prodigy. Along the way Akeelah's friends and even family serve to distract her from her ambition--possibly the only good thing every to happen to this gifted young girl.In going further into the contest, Akeelah can no longer rely on natural talent alone. She must learn Latin and Greek root words, which children at the elite suburban schools have been doing for years. In just a couple months there are many thousands of unpronounceable vocabulary terms that would stump the best graduate students in the country. Her main rival is Dylan Chiu, who has been runner-up in the previous two national contests.There are no surprises in the end, but the journey is enlightening. Along withRoots (Four-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)andStand and Deliverthis is the rare gem of a film worth interrupting class time so that every student can enjoy it.  Akeelah Anderson is a natural role for young Keke Palmer, who has a very bright future in acting.

It begins:Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us.We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?Actually, who are you not to be?Akeelah and the Bee portrays several individuals who have among them a number of fears.  Keke Palmer portrays Akeelah - a girl from a poor, underserved neighborhood in South Los Angeles.  She is smart and has the stuff that might make her the next Condoleeza Rice.  But smart kids are ridiculed in her neighborhood, not treasured, and the big cheese on her block is the local drug dealer.  Laurence Fishburne portrays a college English professor who knows a thing or two about spelling bees, but he has lost his wife and he is fearful of risking an emotional attachment.  Angela Bassett portrays Akeelah's mother, Tanya, a mother who has lost her man and can't imagine a spelling bee being a thing of importance.  Curtis Armstrong seems finally grown up from the Revenge of the Nerds as the principal of Akeelah's school.  He thinks a candle of inspiration might ignite an inferno of academic fervor as his underdog school, if he could only find someone willing to be that candle.  J.R. Villareal portrays Javier, a champion speller from the barrio who is fearful of the things that boys on the edge of puberty are fearful of - such as how do you kiss a girl?  Sean Michael is excellent as the champion Chinese speller from the wealthy side of town, with a father who looks at second place as failure.Some of the plot of Akeelah is quite predictable.  You've seen the skeleton of the story not so much in academic films like ""Stand and Deliver"", but in predictable sports stories like ""The Karate Kid"".  What makes Akeelah special are the moments when the characters take risks and make sacrifices - for others.  At a regional meet Javier stalls up on the stage when Akeelah can't make it for awhile and would be eliminated if her place comes up and she is not there.  In the enevitable, climactic National Spelling Bee Akeelah does something... noble.  You'll have to see for yourself.  But if you can watch this film and be cynical or not like it, I pity you.",5,"5 Stars for Students, Educators, Children, and Adults",1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,2532,"['1992', 'collection', 'works', 'Marianne', 'Williamson', 'was', 'published', 'Return', 'Love', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'quoted', 'one', 'poems', 'Deepest', 'Fear', 'speech', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'often', 'been', 'attributed', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'poem', 'serves', 'emotional', 'touchstone', 'deepest', 'fear', 'not', 'are', 'inadequate.Our', 'deepest', 'fear', 'are', 'powerful', 'measure.It', 'light', 'not', 'darkness', 'most', 'frightens', 'us.We', 'ask', 'who', 'am', 'be', 'brilliant', 'gorgeous', 'talented', 'fabulous', 'Actually', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'several', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'number', 'fears', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'Akeelah', 'girl', 'poor', 'underserved', 'neighborhood', 'South', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'smart', 'stuff', 'might', 'make', 'next', 'Condoleeza', 'Rice', 'smart', 'kids', 'are', 'ridiculed', 'neighborhood', 'not', 'treasured', 'big', 'cheese', 'block', 'local', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'college', 'English', 'professor', 'who', 'thing', 'two', 'spelling', 'bees', 'lost', 'wife', 'fearful', 'risking', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Akeelah', 'mother', 'Tanya', 'mother', 'who', 'lost', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'spelling', 'bee', 'being', 'thing', 'importance', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'finally', 'grown', 'up', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'principal', 'Akeelah', 'school', 'candle', 'inspiration', 'might', 'ignite', 'inferno', 'academic', 'fervor', 'underdog', 'school', 'could', 'only', 'find', 'someone', 'willing', 'be', 'candle', 'J.R.', 'Villareal', 'Javier', 'champion', 'speller', 'barrio', 'who', 'fearful', 'things', 'edge', 'puberty', 'are', 'fearful', 'such', 'how', 'do', 'kiss', 'girl', 'Sean', 'Michael', 'excellent', 'champion', 'Chinese', 'speller', 'wealthy', 'side', 'town', 'father', 'who', 'second', 'place', 'failure.Some', 'plot', 'Akeelah', 'quite', 'predictable', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'skeleton', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'academic', 'films', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'predictable', 'sports', 'stories', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'What', 'Akeelah', 'special', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'characters', 'take', 'risks', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'others', 'regional', 'meet', 'Javier', 'up', 'stage', 'when', 'Akeelah', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'awhile', 'would', 'be', 'eliminated', 'place', 'up', 'not', 'there', 'enevitable', 'climactic', 'National', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'Akeelah', 'something', 'noble', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'be', 'cynical', 'not', 'pity']",N/A

It actually drew me in and I found myself hoping for Akeelah to win.Overall, the story is pretty well crafted.  Akeelah has a talent for words and yet she is ashamed to use it.  Her environment frowns on success and as she states she will get picked on.  Eventually, she decides to try the spelling contests after the Principle and her friend talk her into it.One thing she will need is a tutor.  Enter Laurence Fishburne.  I have liked him for awhile and he does not disappoint as the Professor of English who came up from the ghetto.  He is hard on her as he impress' on her that he will not take anything but a serious effort to learn.  In time their relationship grows as they end help helping each other.  Some would argue a cliche but I found it done well as I didn't feel the need to ""roll my eyes.""There are references to life's issues such the dead father and the brother trying to join a gang.  However, they don't distract from the movie as they are to add to the story rather then create sub stories to fill movie time.  Through all this Akeelah seems to keep the desire and rises above it all.  Some would argue Cliches and they do exist but as I mentioned; I did not find them over blown as it happens so many times these days.The final bee was well done as I never thought I would find myself getting slightly tense over as the words were offered.

998224,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000G1R38U,mirasreviews,"[4, 5]","In the tradition of many children's films, ""Akeelah and the Bee"" tells the story of a child who dreams big and applies herself to achieving her goals. Akeelah (Keke Palmer) is an 11-year-old 7th-grader in South Los Angeles with an erratic attendance record and a determination to avoid being taunted as a ""brainiac"". But Akeelah has an uncanny talent for remembering words and their spellings that doesn't go unnoticed. The school's principal Mr. Welch (Curtis Armstrong) is willing to overlook her absences if Akeelah will help inspire her fellow students and generate a positive image for Crenshaw Middle School by competing in spelling bees. He suggests that his friend, former UCLA English professor Dr. Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne), might make an excellent spelling coach. So Akeelah is off and running, learning to spell and dissect thousands of words, torn between her new goals and her disapproving mother (Angela Bassett).""Akeelah and the Bee"" is the sort of inspirational children's film that encourages youngsters to set their sights high, have confidence in themselves, and work to achieve their goals. The goal is fulfilling your own potential -and, in this case, winning the National Spelling Bee. Writer/director Doug Atchison taps into increased national awareness of the spelling bee subculture since Jeffrey Blitz's documentary ""Spellbound"" captivated audiences in 2003. It's easy for audiences to be enthusiastic about spelling bees and to root for these gifted, driven children. Relationship drama subplots involving Akeelah and her mother and Akeelah and her coach round out the picture. Akeelah is in nearly every scene, so the young actress who plays her must be able to carry a large part of the film's emotional weight. I wasn't always impressed by Keke Palmer's acting, but I was impressed by her screen presence and charisma. She lights up the screen. ""Akeelah and the Bee"" is awkwardly contrived at times, but it is a fun, heartening movie for kids and adults alike.The DVD (Lionsgate 2006): Bonus features include 3 featurettes, 7 deleted scenes, a Gag Reel (2 min), and a music video for the song ""All My Girlz"" (3 1/2 min) by none other than Keke Palmer, looking very much like a young lady, not the child of the film. ""Making of Akeelah and the Bee"" (23 min) is the featurette worth watching. Through interviews with writer/director Doug Atchison, the producers, and the cast, we get the story of the inspiration and ideas behind ""Akeelah and the Bee"", casting Keke Palmer, the 31-day shoot in South L.A., and the efforts to faithfully recreate the National Spelling Bee. ""Two Peas in a Pod"" (4 1/2 min) explores the collaboration between actress Keke Palmer and director Doug Atchison. ""Inside the Mind of Akeelah"" (7 min) is clips of Atchison directing Akeelah.",4,A Vivacious Young Girl's Ambition.

Akeelah is an 11 year old girl from a struggling single parent family in South Central Los Angeles. The principal at her barely functioning school recognizes her talents. He encourages her to enter a small LA USD competition. She is barely interested. And no wonder- her struggling single mother and her friends at school don't even notice or care. It's not there world. And it's definitely not cool. But her interest becomes piqued when, during random channel surfing, she comes across the spelling bee on ESPN. She decides to enter and wins.From there Principal Welch (Curtis Armstrong)introduces her to a brilliant and somewhat reclusive professor Larabee (Lawrence Fishburne). Larabee sees great potential in her and hopes that she can make it to the national spelling bee competition. But first she must be motivated properly. In one memorable scene he sends her away, not sure if she is up to the challenge. Eventually she sees the light and begins to work hard to become competitive. There are many trials and tribulations along the way as she enters smaller regional events that, hopefully, will allow her to make the cut for the national event.While training for the big event, she meets a whole new group friends- talented and gifted kids that she will study with and compete against(and there not all white). Javier (J.R. Villareal) is a gifted but fun loving boy who puts his best effort into helping her even though he will actually be competing against her. All of the performances are excellent. Angela Bassett is excellent as the overburdened single parent who finally sees the light and encourages her daugther to go for it. Sahara Garey plays her sister Georgia, who in one nailbiting scene comes forward when she witnesses parental cheating.

There is no vindictiveness or spitefulness. I don't think I have seen a movie before where EVERY character becomes a better person.Laurence Fishburne has one of the most commanding presences of any actor. Whenever he is not on screen you are just anxious for him to return. His role as the professor is so overwhelming it probably is what gives stature to the whole  movie. Well also, Keke Palmer, the girl who plays Akeelah is enchanting too.This movie is the antidote to African American and Hispanic children being told that they cannot score well because of the ""cultural bias"" in standardized tests. At a time when demagogues make careers of insisting that African American children be taught in ebonics and Hispanic children in ""bilingual"" programs, this movie teaches: ""this is YOUR language; master its' power and a whole universe will open for you"". It is also refreshing to break the stereotypes and see African Americans cheering for things other than what movies typically show (music, sports).Can't say much more that probably hasn't been said already. Unlike what most other reviewers claim, there was a twist as to who wins at the end which I didn't see coming, and made the movie even more enjoyable (now, I shouldn't tell you more about it, should I?).

998247,A12X2J7AVZ04IQ,B000G1R38U,"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[0, 0]","""Akeelah and the Bee"" is one of the finest and most enjoyable films I've seen in years. There are many messages for kids to learn, regarding self-worth, peer pressure and making positive choices in one's life at a young age. There's little I can say that hasn't been said, but I'd like to address a few issues that were brought to mind. First, I really believe that the public educational systems are doing their best to encourage the kids. Societal pressures to be ""cool"" often, I think, have prevented many young people from realizing potential. Also, parents are as much a force in the educational development of kids as the teachers. There is a balance that must be maintained, and knowing your kids' strengths and weaknesses. Certainly, Akeelah's mother had issues that kept her from initially knowing the passion of her child to succeed. The Korean kid's father also had selfish issues. Finding that fine line is tough; parenting is tough. Also, this could be about any child who is in a less than affluent household. The fact that Akeelah is Black is incidental. That said, I simply can't believe that this film by Doug Atchison won only a few awards. The acting is without any weak spot; Fishburne and Bassett are fresh and in touch with their material (as in ""What's Love Got to Do with It"", where Oscar recognized both with noms).

998250,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000G1R38U,RMurray847,"[6, 7]","Akeelah is the smartest girl in her poor Los Angeles school.  She's tired of being made fun of or taken advantage of for her brains, and has basically learned to hide her light under a bushel, as it were.  Eventually, she is encouraged to participate in a spelling bee, and over time, her spark of competition, pride and desire to win is lit, and she emerges from her shell as a lovely, witty, intelligent, caring and darn near perfect young lady.  The adults around her are moved by her.  Her peers grow to admire her, even when that admiration is against their own best interests.  Everything begins to fall in place for her, as even her entire neighborhood is united in helping her win the National Spelling Bee.Yep, I tried to make the plot seem outrageous and hard to swallow.  And it is, if you step back and force yourself to think about the movie's plot lines and developments.  It's got every ""corny"" clich? of every underdog sports movie ever written.  It should not work.Instead, the movie sweeps you up almost completely and utterly.  You follow every moment avidly, rooting for our hero, even when she's being difficult.  You yearn for the most predictable plot twist to come true.  AKEELAH AND THE BEE is simply joyful storytelling at its best.  You pretty much know where the journey will take you, yet at the same time, all the characters (minor and major) have little ""tricks"" up their sleeves, little moments where we get to see the BEST that's buried in them.  It's such an amazingly OPTIMISTIC movie, about everyone and everything.  Yet at the same time, we see how the poor kids, mostly minorities, feel shut out from the rest of the world.  How they've given up on achieving what the kids from better neighborhoods can achieve.  When Akeelah's school has its first bee, the kids are asked fairly simple words, and they still stumble.  But Akeelah has a gift, one which initially draws taunts, but eventually, her accomplishments inspire those around her.  She becomes a symbol in her neighborhood for hope, for the possibility of good things happening to people who work hard and behave well.I knew going into the movie that it had received good reviews, so I expected it to rise above the clich?.  I knew Laurence Fishburne would deliver the same mellifluous performance he always gives, and that Angela Bassett would be tough and loving at the same time.  I knew the bee itself would be packed with tension and unusual characters (having seen and loved SPELLBOUND).  What I didn't know what that the movie would MOVE me.  Seeing Akeelah crumble tough exteriors everywhere she went was heartwarming...a word I seldom toss out, believe me!  I'm too cynical to have my heart warmed, but this film did it...over and over.The filmmakers obviously embraced their clich?s lovingly, and that helps.  The script, while predictable, is tight, well-paced, literate and thoughtful.  But the reason it all works SO well is the remarkable, remarkable performance by Keke Palmer as young Akeelah.  If Keisha Castle Hughes could get nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for Whale Rider, I dare say Miss Palmer deserves similar accolades.  Her face is so open.  Her enthusiasm palpable and her intelligence radiates.  While her character is almost too ""good,"" Ms. Palmer makes it all work.  She makes Akeelah a girl who simply sees no reason why everyone else can't be happy too.  It's been a long time since I rooted so strongly for a character.And the movie is only PG.  There are a couple of minor curse words early on, but other than that...there is NO reason children shouldn't go.  They MUST go, in my opinion.  Any child aged 9 or older should see this film.I can't believe how much I've gushed over it.  This isn't the greatest film ever made.  It doesn't break new ground in filmmaking.  In fact, it embraces the old-fashioned.  But for what it attempts, AKEELAH totally achieves.  It's so nice to see a film without cynicism, yet isn't cloying.  It's uplifting.  I guess if I could only pick one word to describe it, that would be it...UPLIFTING.See it!!!!",5,"UPLIFTING, inspiring, lovingly crafted.",1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,4076,"['Akeelah', 'smartest', 'girl', 'poor', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'school', 'tired', 'being', 'made', 'fun', 'taken', 'advantage', 'brains', 'basically', 'learned', 'hide', 'light', 'bushel', 'were', 'Eventually', 'encouraged', 'participate', 'spelling', 'bee', 'time', 'spark', 'competition', 'pride', 'desire', 'win', 'lit', 'shell', 'lovely', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'caring', 'darn', 'perfect', 'young', 'lady', 'adults', 'are', 'moved', 'peers', 'grow', 'admire', 'even', 'when', 'admiration', 'own', 'best', 'interests', 'Everything', 'fall', 'place', 'even', 'entire', 'neighborhood', 'united', 'helping', 'win', 'National', 'Spelling', 'Bee.Yep', 'tried', 'make', 'plot', 'seem', 'outrageous', 'hard', 'swallow', 'step', 'back', 'force', 'think', 'movie', 'plot', 'lines', 'developments', 'got', 'corny', 'clich', 'underdog', 'sports', 'movie', 'ever', 'written', 'should', 'not', 'work.Instead', 'movie', 'sweeps', 'almost', 'completely', 'utterly', 'follow', 'moment', 'avidly', 'rooting', 'hero', 'even', 'when', 'being', 'difficult', 'yearn', 'most', 'predictable', 'plot', 'twist', 'come', 'true', 'AKEELAH', 'THE', 'BEE', 'simply', 'joyful', 'storytelling', 'best', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'where', 'journey', 'will', 'take', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'characters', 'minor', 'major', 'have', 'little', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeves', 'little', 'moments', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'BEST', 'buried', 'such', 'amazingly', 'OPTIMISTIC', 'movie', 'everyone', 'everything', 'same', 'time', 'see', 'how', 'poor', 'kids', 'mostly', 'minorities', 'feel', 'shut', 'out', 'rest', 'world', 'How', ""'ve"", 'given', 'up', 'achieving', 'what', 'kids', 'better', 'neighborhoods', 'can', 'achieve', 'When', 'Akeelah', 'school', 'first', 'bee', 'kids', 'are', 'asked', 'fairly', 'simple', 'words', 'still', 'stumble', 'Akeelah', 'gift', 'one', 'initially', 'taunts', 'eventually', 'accomplishments', 'inspire', 'symbol', 'neighborhood', 'hope', 'possibility', 'good', 'things', 'happening', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'hard', 'behave', 'well.I', 'knew', 'going', 'movie', 'had', 'received', 'good', 'reviews', 'so', 'expected', 'rise', 'clich', 'knew', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'would', 'deliver', 'same', 'mellifluous', 'performance', 'always', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'loving', 'same', 'time', 'knew', 'bee', 'would', 'be', 'packed', 'tension', 'unusual', 'characters', 'having', 'seen', 'loved', 'SPELLBOUND', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'would', 'MOVE', 'Seeing', 'Akeelah', 'crumble', 'tough', 'exteriors', 'everywhere', 'went', 'was', 'heartwarming', 'word', 'seldom', 'out', 'believe', ""'m"", 'too', 'cynical', 'have', 'heart', 'warmed', 'film', 'did', 'over.The', 'filmmakers', 'obviously', 'embraced', 'clich', 's', 'lovingly', 'script', 'predictable', 'tight', 'well-paced', 'literate', 'thoughtful', 'reason', 'SO', 'well', 'remarkable', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'young', 'Akeelah', 'Keisha', 'Castle', 'Hughes', 'could', 'get', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'dare', 'say', 'Miss', 'Palmer', 'similar', 'accolades', 'face', 'so', 'open', 'enthusiasm', 'palpable', 'intelligence', 'radiates', 'character', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'Ms.', 'Palmer', 'work', 'girl', 'who', 'simply', 'reason', 'why', 'everyone', 'else', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'too', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'rooted', 'so', 'strongly', 'character.And', 'movie', 'only', 'PG', 'are', 'couple', 'minor', 'curse', 'words', 'early', 'other', 'NO', 'reason', 'children', 'should', ""n't"", 'go', 'MUST', 'go', 'opinion', 'child', 'aged', '9', 'older', 'should', 'see', 'film.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'much', ""'ve"", 'gushed', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'filmmaking', 'fact', 'old-fashioned', 'what', 'AKEELAH', 'totally', 'so', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'cynicism', ""n't"", 'cloying', 'uplifting', 'guess', 'could', 'only', 'pick', 'one', 'word', 'describe', 'would', 'be']",N/A

Why did you have to take what looked like it was going to be a really good little inspirational story  and turn it into a piece of emotionally manipulative dreck? You were doing so well there for a while, and then... but I get ahead of myself.The story concerns Akeelah Anderson (Cleaner's Keke Palmer), a junior high student from South Central LA whose late father (Wolfgang Bodison, in flashback) instilled a love of words in her. Her teacher is trying to get her to enter the school's inaugural spelling bee, but she isn't interested until she sees a snippet of the National Spelling Bee on ESPN. Then she starts thinking about it. Once she's on her way to regionals, the school principal knows she's going to need a coach, so he hooks Akeelah up with Larabee (Laurence Fishburne), a retired professor with problems of his own. None of this is making Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) terribly happy, especially when Akeelah starts hanging out with her new spelling-club friends, all of whom live in much swankier parts of the city.All well and good, and while there's some obvious audience manipulation in the first two-thirds of the film, it's tolerable; there's a kind of Real Women Have Curves feel to it for a while, the whole ""local girl makes good"" shtick that plays so well. But then comes the final third of the film, and it takes a wrong turn down a blind alley. Atchison, who also wrote the script, throws any pretense at subtlety out the window, coming up with the one ending that feels like a complete cop-out. Of all the things he could have done with it, wow. The ending is just brutally bad.The rest of the film, however, is well worth watching.

I was sure I had seen it before in the same, tired, mentor-underprivileged kid(s) genre.Three things made me give it a chance:1. Laurence Fishburne who is always delicious to watch and can give a quiet dignity to any scene in any movie.2. Angela Bassett who in her ever present gorgeousness and grace must have descended from a line of ancient royalty.3. I am one of those nerds who actually watch the Spelling Bee on ESPN.I am glad I watched it. My eyes stayed moist almost throughout the entire movie but my heart glowed. Keke Palmer does an awesome job as Akeelah blossoming from an uncertain progidy into becoming 'powerful beyond measure' and every nuance, change and unfurling is expertly captured on camera and that was my undoing: this subtle and powerful transformation.Palmer holds her own amidst the screen legends and it was fascinating for me to see how both Fishburne and Basset somehow tone done their huge screen charisma on this small movie. It proved to me that these two are in a great class of actors, as yet undefined.The DVD has pretty good extras and I do like how everything is spelt and pronunciations given. I thought is was funny, silly and slightly quirky.My only hope is that Keke Palmer keeps this pace because if she does, she will one day hold Hollywood in the palm of her hand as do Fishburne and Bassett.",5,"You go, Akeelah!",1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,1390,"['Truthfully', 'was', 'NOT', 'expecting', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'sure', 'had', 'seen', 'same', 'tired', 'mentor-underprivileged', 'kid', 'genre.Three', 'things', 'made', 'give', 'chance:1', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'always', 'delicious', 'watch', 'can', 'give', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'scene', 'movie.2', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'who', 'ever', 'present', 'gorgeousness', 'grace', 'must', 'have', 'descended', 'line', 'ancient', 'royalty.3', 'am', 'one', 'nerds', 'who', 'actually', 'watch', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'ESPN.I', 'am', 'glad', 'watched', 'My', 'eyes', 'stayed', 'moist', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'heart', 'glowed', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'awesome', 'job', 'Akeelah', 'blossoming', 'uncertain', 'progidy', 'becoming', ""'powerful"", 'measure', 'nuance', 'change', 'unfurling', 'expertly', 'captured', 'camera', 'was', 'undoing', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'transformation.Palmer', 'own', 'amidst', 'screen', 'was', 'fascinating', 'see', 'how', 'Fishburne', 'Basset', 'somehow', 'tone', 'done', 'huge', 'screen', 'charisma', 'small', 'movie', 'proved', 'two', 'are', 'great', 'class', 'actors', 'yet', 'undefined.The', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'extras', 'do', 'how', 'everything', 'spelt', 'pronunciations', 'given', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'silly', 'slightly', 'only', 'hope', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'pace', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'hold', 'Hollywood', 'palm', 'hand', 'do', 'Fishburne', 'Bassett']",N/A

998260,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000G1R38U,Sean Pasek,"[0, 0]","I have come across a number of gems in ""small"" movies that tend to have the most impact.  These are movies that seem to be overlooked at the box office by movie-goers.  Perhaps there is a fear that they are too corny, sentimental, or just plain boring.  However, many of these films are anything but.Akeelah and the Bee dares Americans to face a glaring paradox:  Everyone is a winner.  Yes, we preach this and we try to teach this.  This film actually makes this concept work.  In a society that thrives (many times too much) on competition, we often forget that people have feelings.  How often do kids who help remind us of that fact.  For example, in the Little League World Series, you often see many acts of sportsmanship.Akeelah and the Bee is about a young African-American girl who lives in south central Los Angeles.  She lives with her mother who works as a nurse and struggles just to make ends meet.  Akeelah discovers that she has a love for words, and spends hours looking through the dictionary to not only be able to spell the word, but also understand what the word means.This is a hobby that she keeps to herself.  She doesn't want her classmates to get wind of the fact that she just might like something academic at school.  However, when her English teacher notices that Akeelah does exceptionally well on her spelling tests, the teacher immediately attempts to get Akeelah to participate in the school spelling bee.  Reluctantly, she agrees.As brilliant as Akeelah is with words, she still needs a lot of work and help.  Enter her ""spelling coach,"" Dr. Larabee (played magnificently by Laurence Fishburne who was also a producer for the film).  Dr. Larabee also has a love of words, but he has to encourage Akeelah to study the origins of the different words, and perhaps even more importantly, he helps to instill a confidence and a sense of self-worth in Akeelah.  One of the first steps is that Larabee will not allow Akeelah to speak ghetto-talk.  ""You will speak intelligently,"" he says.  It is a bit of a mystery at first as to why Larabee wants to coach Akeelah as it is apparent that there is something else going on.  There is a touching reason that I will not disclose here that reveals a deeper reason.Angela Bassett plays Akeelah's mother.  And her performance, as in so many of her films, she does a great job.  She plays a hard mother but a caring one.  She is so busy with work, that it comes as a surprise to her when she finds out about Akeelah's talent.Another surprising performance is given by Curtis Armstrong as Akeelah's principal.  Armstrong has done mostly comedic roles, such as the infamous ""Booger"" in ""Revenge of the Nerds.""  I was slightly apprehensive at first, but he also turns in a very credible job.  He plays a very supportive school principal.  After seeing this role, you might wonder why we don't have more ""supportive"" principals in our schools.Of course, I can't mention performances without mentioning Laurence Fishburne.  He is still one of my favorite actors.  He is so brilliant at embodying the sage-like man who has an unswerving and quiet wisdom.  My two favorite roles of his are Morpheus from the ""Matrix,"" and Furious Styles from ""Boyz and the Hood.""  His performance here in this film is no less inspiring and thought-provoking.At last, I have to talk about newcomer, Keke Palmer (Akeelah).  This amazing, young actress turns in a great performance as the young spelling, whiz kid.  While she plays Akeelah with a young, impressionable sweetness, she is also able to tap into the brewing teenage arrogance that is starting to come out.  Akeelah has got some attitude, but Palmer is careful to not let that overshadow the softness and kindness of Akeelah.This film may seem a bit formulaic, but I assure you, it has a surprise at the end that I would bet few people see coming.  This is a film that will have you feeling good no matter how many times you've seen it.  It has that kind of power that very few films are able to capture.  These kinds of movies are called ""gems"" because very few of them seem to come along.  I truly wish that there were more films like this out there.  It demonstrates that movies can be so effective in inspiring and educating, but few movies are made to do this.  Anyway, you can't possibly go wrong with this film which is easily watchable fo the entire family.",5,"It's Often The ""Small"" Films That Pack The Most Punch!",1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,4369,"['have', 'come', 'number', 'gems', 'small', 'movies', 'tend', 'have', 'most', 'impact', 'are', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'overlooked', 'box', 'office', 'movie-goers', 'Perhaps', 'fear', 'are', 'too', 'corny', 'sentimental', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'However', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'anything', 'but.Akeelah', 'Bee', 'dares', 'Americans', 'face', 'glaring', 'paradox', 'Everyone', 'winner', 'Yes', 'preach', 'try', 'teach', 'film', 'actually', 'concept', 'work', 'society', 'many', 'times', 'too', 'much', 'competition', 'often', 'forget', 'people', 'have', 'feelings', 'How', 'often', 'do', 'kids', 'who', 'help', 'remind', 'fact', 'example', 'Little', 'League', 'World', 'Series', 'often', 'see', 'many', 'acts', 'sportsmanship.Akeelah', 'Bee', 'young', 'African-American', 'girl', 'who', 'south', 'central', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'mother', 'who', 'nurse', 'just', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Akeelah', 'love', 'words', 'hours', 'looking', 'dictionary', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'able', 'spell', 'word', 'also', 'understand', 'what', 'word', 'means.This', 'hobby', 'herself', ""n't"", 'want', 'classmates', 'get', 'wind', 'fact', 'just', 'might', 'like', 'something', 'academic', 'school', 'However', 'when', 'English', 'teacher', 'notices', 'Akeelah', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'spelling', 'tests', 'teacher', 'immediately', 'get', 'Akeelah', 'participate', 'school', 'spelling', 'bee', 'Reluctantly', 'brilliant', 'Akeelah', 'words', 'still', 'lot', 'work', 'help', 'Enter', 'spelling', 'coach', 'Dr.', 'Larabee', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'producer', 'film', 'Dr.', 'Larabee', 'also', 'love', 'words', 'encourage', 'Akeelah', 'study', 'origins', 'different', 'words', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'importantly', 'instill', 'confidence', 'sense', 'self-worth', 'Akeelah', 'One', 'first', 'steps', 'Larabee', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'Akeelah', 'speak', 'ghetto-talk', 'will', 'speak', 'intelligently', 'bit', 'mystery', 'first', 'why', 'Larabee', 'coach', 'Akeelah', 'apparent', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'touching', 'reason', 'will', 'not', 'disclose', 'here', 'deeper', 'reason.Angela', 'Bassett', 'Akeelah', 'mother', 'performance', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'great', 'job', 'hard', 'mother', 'caring', 'one', 'so', 'busy', 'work', 'surprise', 'when', 'out', 'Akeelah', 'talent.Another', 'surprising', 'performance', 'given', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'Akeelah', 'principal', 'Armstrong', 'done', 'mostly', 'comedic', 'roles', 'such', 'infamous', 'Booger', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'was', 'slightly', 'apprehensive', 'first', 'also', 'very', 'credible', 'job', 'very', 'supportive', 'school', 'principal', 'seeing', 'role', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'supportive', 'principals', 'schools.Of', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mention', 'performances', 'mentioning', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'so', 'brilliant', 'embodying', 'sage-like', 'man', 'who', 'unswerving', 'quiet', 'wisdom', 'two', 'favorite', 'roles', 'are', 'Morpheus', 'Matrix', 'Furious', 'Styles', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'performance', 'here', 'film', 'less', 'inspiring', 'thought-provoking.At', 'last', 'have', 'talk', 'newcomer', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'Akeelah', 'amazing', 'young', 'actress', 'great', 'performance', 'young', 'spelling', 'whiz', 'kid', 'Akeelah', 'young', 'impressionable', 'sweetness', 'also', 'able', 'tap', 'brewing', 'teenage', 'arrogance', 'starting', 'come', 'out', 'Akeelah', 'got', 'attitude', 'Palmer', 'careful', 'not', 'let', 'overshadow', 'softness', 'kindness', 'Akeelah.This', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'formulaic', 'assure', 'surprise', 'end', 'would', 'bet', 'few', 'people', 'see', 'coming', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'feeling', 'good', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kind', 'power', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'able', 'capture', 'kinds', 'movies', 'are', 'called', 'gems', 'very', 'few', 'seem', 'come', 'along', 'truly', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'films', 'there', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'effective', 'inspiring', 'educating', 'few', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'do', 'Anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'film', 'easily', 'watchable', 'fo', 'entire', 'family']",N/A

But the teacher and Principal Welch (Curtis Armstrong) wants her to take part in the first annual Spelling Bee, and Akeelah doesn't want to do it in the first place, because she is afaird that the kids will dissover, and make fun of her special talent. She leaves with a big family, with even a couple of so brothers and sisters. Akeelah's Dad  (Wolfgang Bodison) was killed by a stranger when Akeelah was only 6 years old. The winner gets to make it to District, and try to place in the top ten, to get to the Regionals.

At at the first meeting at Dr. Larabee's house, things doesn't go well, but soon Akeelah decides that she wants to win a National Spelling Bee. And begs Dr. Larabee to give her a 2nd chance, he agrees as long as she works around his schedule, but at the moment, he isn't teaching, and that she shows up on time to the meetings, otherwise the deal is off.

998269,A359IT81FBX64Y,B000G1R38U,Steven Mason,"[6, 9]","There are two ways to look at this movie. It's better as a Disneyesque sugar-coated inspirational family movie, as long as the parents and kids watching it don't get too serious or go too deep analyzing it. There is one worthwhile lesson that can be gleaned: it takes hard work and dedicated study, even for the talented, to become a ""champion.""But even that lesson is tainted by the focus on super champion status, as all of the main characters finish in the top 5 nationally. Wow! How many of us can hope to be in the top 5 of anything, even in our own city, county, or state, let alone at the national level? How realistic is that, and ultimately, how inspirational? I wonder why so many so-called inspirational movies seem to imply that ""winners"" are those who finish at or near the very top?Another failing of these inspirational movies is that the winners often have a special (almost magical) gift or huge amount of talent. Akeelah apparently possesses a photographic memory for words, which enables her, in the span of a couple of months, to learn enough words to beat hundreds of talented nationally-ranked contestants who have studied for years. I might marvel at such abilities and talents, but how can I feel inspired by them? Shall I feel inspired that Mozart began writing piano pieces at age five?This movie takes place in an almost Pollyannaish ghetto in notorious South Central LA. Even the gangbangers and drug dealers are decent people (they write poetry and help Akeelah practice spelling!). Akeelah's mom and dad are smart, loving, married parents (again, not typical in a ghetto), but when Akeelah was six her Scrabble-loving dad was shot dead by a gangbanger and so mom has been raising the kids alone for five years. The mom works as a nurse at a hospital and no, we don't know why she hasn't moved her family out of the ghetto. Neither do we know why she hasn't remarried in five years, after all, she is a beautiful, smart woman (Angela Bassett).The role of the mom is a little confusing. Does she work nights and weekends or does she have more than one job? It doesn't make sense that the neighborhood Akeelah lives in can turn out to be so supportive over one girl in a spelling bee and not supportive in other ways. Akeelah's mom gets more upset about Akeelah taking a bus to the rich kids' neighborhood to practice spelling than about her not doing half of her school homework. And Akeelah's dad was killed by a gangbanger, but it's okay for Akeelah to practice her spelling with the gangbangers? Really?!The principal of Akeelah's school is a white man who seems more concerned about Akeelah winning the spelling bee than with problems with drugs and gangs. Of course, since this is a Pollyannaish movie we don't hear about the drugs, gangs, and violence at the school. Akeelah's only complaint about the school is that it is boring and there are no doors on the bathroom stalls. The principal tells Akeelah that if she wins the spelling bee the school might get the money it needs for doors. So that's how it works? If one kid at an inner-city school wins the national spelling bee, or the national math competition, or the national science test, it will get money? But the school gets nothing if the kid places 5th, or 10th, nationally? How inspirational!The value of devoting so much time and effort to learning how to spell so many thousands of strange words is never questioned. Do national spelling champions do better in life, and are they happier? We are told that Akeelah spells words partly because she used to play Scrabble with her dad and partly because the distraction of rote memorization helps her cope with the loss of her dad. So Akeelah has an ""excuse"" for what may seem to be a weird hobby. But I wonder what all those kids could accomplish if they devoted those thousands of hours to something else besides memorizing word spellings? How many books could they read or how many languages could they learn to speak?One other point: Akeelah seems to be the only black child in all of the spelling bee competitions. Is that supposed to be a reflection of reality, or is it for dramatic effect?Crenshaw High School is a real school and is better known for its basketball than for its spelling bees. It is the scene for several movies and TV shows, including Boyz N The Hood.",3,How do you spell Pollyannaish?,1223856000,"10 13, 2008",2008,4321,"['are', 'two', 'ways', 'look', 'movie', 'better', 'Disneyesque', 'sugar-coated', 'inspirational', 'family', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'parents', 'kids', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'serious', 'go', 'too', 'deep', 'analyzing', 'one', 'worthwhile', 'lesson', 'can', 'be', 'gleaned', 'hard', 'work', 'dedicated', 'study', 'even', 'talented', 'become', 'champion', 'even', 'lesson', 'tainted', 'focus', 'super', 'champion', 'status', 'main', 'characters', 'finish', 'top', '5', 'nationally', 'Wow', 'How', 'many', 'can', 'hope', 'be', 'top', '5', 'anything', 'even', 'own', 'city', 'county', 'state', 'let', 'alone', 'national', 'level', 'How', 'realistic', 'ultimately', 'how', 'inspirational', 'wonder', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'so-called', 'inspirational', 'movies', 'seem', 'imply', 'winners', 'are', 'who', 'finish', 'very', 'top', 'failing', 'inspirational', 'movies', 'winners', 'often', 'have', 'special', 'almost', 'magical', 'gift', 'huge', 'amount', 'talent', 'Akeelah', 'apparently', 'photographic', 'memory', 'words', 'span', 'couple', 'months', 'learn', 'enough', 'words', 'beat', 'hundreds', 'talented', 'nationally-ranked', 'contestants', 'who', 'have', 'studied', 'years', 'might', 'marvel', 'such', 'abilities', 'talents', 'how', 'can', 'feel', 'inspired', 'Shall', 'feel', 'inspired', 'Mozart', 'began', 'writing', 'piano', 'pieces', 'age', 'five', 'movie', 'place', 'almost', 'Pollyannaish', 'ghetto', 'notorious', 'South', 'Central', 'LA', 'Even', 'gangbangers', 'drug', 'dealers', 'are', 'decent', 'people', 'write', 'poetry', 'help', 'Akeelah', 'practice', 'spelling', 'Akeelah', 'mom', 'dad', 'are', 'smart', 'loving', 'married', 'parents', 'again', 'not', 'typical', 'ghetto', 'when', 'Akeelah', 'was', 'six', 'Scrabble-loving', 'dad', 'was', 'shot', 'dead', 'gangbanger', 'so', 'mom', 'been', 'raising', 'kids', 'alone', 'five', 'years', 'mom', 'nurse', 'hospital', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""n't"", 'moved', 'family', 'ghetto', 'do', 'know', 'why', ""n't"", 'remarried', 'five', 'years', 'beautiful', 'smart', 'woman', 'Angela', 'Bassett', '.The', 'role', 'mom', 'little', 'confusing', 'work', 'nights', 'weekends', 'have', 'more', 'one', 'job', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'neighborhood', 'Akeelah', 'can', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'supportive', 'one', 'girl', 'spelling', 'bee', 'not', 'supportive', 'other', 'ways', 'Akeelah', 'mom', 'more', 'upset', 'Akeelah', 'taking', 'bus', 'rich', 'kids', 'neighborhood', 'practice', 'spelling', 'not', 'doing', 'half', 'school', 'homework', 'Akeelah', 'dad', 'was', 'killed', 'gangbanger', 'okay', 'Akeelah', 'practice', 'spelling', 'gangbangers', 'Really', 'principal', 'Akeelah', 'school', 'white', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'concerned', 'Akeelah', 'winning', 'spelling', 'bee', 'problems', 'drugs', 'gangs', 'course', 'Pollyannaish', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'drugs', 'gangs', 'violence', 'school', 'Akeelah', 'only', 'complaint', 'school', 'boring', 'are', 'doors', 'bathroom', 'stalls', 'principal', 'tells', 'Akeelah', 'spelling', 'bee', 'school', 'might', 'get', 'money', 'doors', 'how', 'one', 'kid', 'inner-city', 'school', 'national', 'spelling', 'bee', 'national', 'math', 'competition', 'national', 'science', 'test', 'will', 'get', 'money', 'school', 'nothing', 'kid', '5th', '10th', 'nationally', 'How', 'inspirational', 'value', 'devoting', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'effort', 'learning', 'how', 'spell', 'so', 'many', 'thousands', 'strange', 'words', 'never', 'questioned', 'Do', 'national', 'spelling', 'champions', 'do', 'better', 'life', 'are', 'happier', 'are', 'told', 'Akeelah', 'words', 'partly', 'used', 'play', 'Scrabble', 'dad', 'partly', 'distraction', 'rote', 'memorization', 'cope', 'loss', 'dad', 'So', 'Akeelah', 'excuse', 'what', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'weird', 'hobby', 'wonder', 'what', 'kids', 'could', 'accomplish', 'devoted', 'thousands', 'hours', 'something', 'else', 'memorizing', 'word', 'spellings', 'How', 'many', 'books', 'could', 'read', 'how', 'many', 'languages', 'could', 'learn', 'speak', 'One', 'other', 'point', 'Akeelah', 'be', 'only', 'black', 'child', 'spelling', 'bee', 'competitions', 'supposed', 'be', 'reflection', 'reality', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'Crenshaw', 'High', 'School', 'real', 'school', 'better', 'known', 'basketball', 'spelling', 'bees', 'scene', 'several', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'including', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood']",N/A

998273,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000G1R38U,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[12, 13]","After watching the new film ""Akeelah and the Bee"", I told two of my friends with daughters about the same age as the title character they had to see this film. One of my friends said his daughters didn't want to see it. They thought it looked boring. Well, there are no flying wizards in the film, but ""Akeelah and the Bee"" is a very good film, something everyone should see. Especially children in the same age bracket as the spelling dynamo.""Akeelah and the Bee"" is a great film for everyone in the entire family. I defy you, or anyone you see this film with to not be moved by the story.Akeelah (Keke Palmer), a student at Crenshaw Middle School, in South Los Angeles, is bored with her school. Her teachers recognize her intelligence; she gets good grades, but her attendance and attitude are lacking. The school hosts its first Spelling Bee and the Principal (Curtis Armstrong) insists Akeelah participate. After she trounces the competition, she attracts the attention of Dr. Larabee (Laurence Fishburne), a professor on sabbatical and former contestant in the National Spelling Bee who agrees to coach Akeelah. But her mother (Angela Bassett) is too distracted to notice her daughter is going to the City Spelling Bee and then the Regionals. Soon, Akeelah has the entire community rooting for her and helping her, pushing her to win the National Spelling Bee in Washington, DC.Yes, the film is predictable and, at times, a little sappy. But the performance of Keke Palmer as Akeelah quickly makes you forget about the few problems the film has. Akeelah is like many middle school students; afraid to show how intelligent she is because she will be teased by other students, she purposely dumbs herself down in public situations. This is unfortunate, but it happens. When she receives an `A' on a spelling test, she quickly hides the paper, afraid some of the mean girls will find out. She doesn't want to participate in the school's Bee because she wants to remain under the radar. Sure enough, at the Bee, two girls stand in back and heckle Akeelah. So far, we are really talking about a TV Movie of the Week caliber performance. Then we learn more about Akeelah. We learn about her relationship with her mother and father, her older brothers, how she challenges herself at home, why she does this. She has to put up a front to survive in the school and the area where she lives. But at home, she is free to play Scrabble against a computer, or to study flash cards. Also, we soon learn why she isn't the best student and it all makes sense. She is a complicated young lady and Palmer does a great job of making her believable. It is a very good performance from someone so young.Fishburne is the other major character, and he is very good. There is a lot resting below the surface of Dr. Larabee. As he reluctantly decides to coach the young lady, he admonishes her against using slang and ghetto talk. As soon as he says this, and she realizes he is serious, she effortlessly begins using proper English. But why does he seem to have a grudge against the community where he lives? As they move forward with the coaching, Larabee becomes more withdrawn, and eventually tells Akeelah that he has done all he can, giving his young prot?g? a feeling of abandonment. She is confused and doesn't feel like continuing. Then Akeelah's mom (Angela Bassett) pays a visit and learns more about his reasons. Both Akeelah and Dr. Larabee have had very similar experiences, leading to their respective attitudes. When you realize the reasons behind Larabee's behavior, it suddenly all makes sense. His character has many layers and part of the journey is unraveling them.Bassett has, perhaps, the most difficult role. She is a single mom, trying to keep track of a son who is getting mixed up with gangs. When Akeelah comes home and announces that she will be going to the National Spelling Bee, her mom is concerned about her school work. Because of the previous attendance problem, Akeelah is told she has to go to summer school. This is all her mom can process, she can't even realize Akeelah has a chance to win a NATIONAL SPELLING BEE; she doesn't even have the chance to process what this is. When she finally realizes her daughter might win this contest, her reaction is very natural. She doesn't immediately gush and become a doting mother; she is initially hurt her daughter lied to her. Once she reconciles this, she helps and encourages her daughter.The performances are good because they convey what life is like for these characters without falling into stereotypes. Yes, they live in a drug and gang filled area, but Akeelah's mom works as a nurse, and struggles with her oldest son. Akeelah is smart, but can't show it too much at school, if she wants to remain ""normal"". Dr. Larabee lives in the community he has lived all his life, despite some problems. Each of the actors provides a vivid portrayal of a three dimensional character.As she begins to study for the Bee, she also meets other people outside of her community. She becomes friends with Javier (J.R. Villareal), a student from Woodland Hills who placed 13th in the previous year's National Bee. As their friendship grows, she spends more time with him and his family, traveling to the more affluent suburb, recognizing how lacking her neighborhood and school are. At one point, she says ""Why would I want to represent the school I hate?"" We soon learn she has a poor attendance record and problems in school because she is bored, not because she is dumb. Because she is bored, she has no motivation.Generally, in a film like this, you can predict the outcome. But the filmmakers have managed to throw a nice little twist into the final scene, making it all the more interesting, exciting and emotional.My one complaint for the film is the production quality is a little low. Clearly, the film was made on an independent budget and, at times, looks like it would be more at home as a Television Movie of the Week. Compare this film to the recent ""Bee Season"" which is also about a young lady going to the National Spelling Bee, and you will see two films that look very different. ""Season"" was produced by a major production company and looks like a big studio film; glossy, perfectly lit, beautiful. ""Akeelah"" is a bit duller looking and doesn't appear as polished. This is a small complaint and I only make it because it is unfair to ""Akeelah"", the better film. More money was probably spent on Richard Gere's salary for ""Season"" than the entire budget of ""Akeelah"". That's a shame, because the message of ""Akeelah"" is so much more universal, uplifting and encouraging.Take everyone you know to see ""Akeelah and the Bee"". You will all enjoy it and the film might just help someone get past a hurdle they have been struggling with for a long time.",5,Go See This Film Already!,1147305600,"05 11,

998274,A1ISW6NMR45Y71,B000G1R38U,Tome Raider,"[16, 16]","I took my six-year-old to see this at the theater today.  I thought it might inspire her to become more interested in word structure and spelling. Wow, I bet it did that and more! I would be willing to say that this movie has a good chance of being life-altering for any kid who goes into it with the slightest curiosity or interest. There are great performances by all, and important principles are illustrated without the slightest trace of preachiness.This movie shows an extremely nice fatherless young girl overcome a variety of adverse circumstances and push herself to her limit.  This is a great film about self-discipline and dedication and taking the risks necessary to achieve personal greatness. Be it spelling, bicycling, piano, ballet or soccer, this film spells out the formula for accomplishment. I think your kids will pick up on the lesson, it penetrates invitingly.  It also shows kids being very nice to one another, before biases and social classes have hardened and divided us.This film was not at all preachy, but it really highlights the tangible nature of some of the disadvantages facing our kids in poorer communities.  There are kids in those areas with tremendous academic talent and a willingness to work to accomplish big things.  America should be a country where every kid who desires to achieve, and is willing to work hard to do so,  receives a fair shot at that on a level playing field.  Akeelah got some help from her friends here--and a dedicated school pricipal--but I fear that in real life there may be some Akeelahs falling through the cracks.An English professor played by Laurence Fishbourne was one of the breaks Akeelah got here.  I liked it that he gave her no slack, no ""affirmative action"" for her hardships. He held the bar very high and expected a lot ffrom her in every way, and she rose to the occasion. And, during his teaching of her, he healed a few of his old wounds as well. I was kind of hoping that he would hook up with Akeelah's mom, or at least a hint that that was going to happen, because that would have been perfect.This was a very sweet and entertaining movie, and I have to tell you I left the theater a little teary-eyed. The friendly little Hispanic kid who goes out of his way to befriend Akeelah will obviously be a cult figure for decades. His playful good naturedness is an example for all of us. This movie struck the absolute right tone on several themes of social importance, and I think good ole Starbucks has to be congratulated on a great debut into the movie biz.I saw the Disney movie ""Eight Below"" earlier this week and it also just blew me away, and so I'm now going to start paying a lot more attention to these movies intended for younger audiences!!

998278,A39Z2M0O2K3XY2,B000G1R38U,Warlen Bassham,"[3, 3]","I had always thought there were only two possible outcomes to the 'pyramidal' type suspense story-- that is, the type like 'Rocky' or 'The Karate Kid' that takes a central character to an ultimate confrontation, with either an uplifting 'Agony of Defeat' type of climax or a 'Success of Course' type outcome.  [The underrated Searching for Bobby Fischer is another excellent example.]Silly me!There's at least one more kind of ending possible, and Akeelah and the Bee provides a perfect example of it.  I'm sure it will be copied extensively as time rolls forward, but this movie is the first one to feature it, and the surprise is delightful.  In other words, it doesn't end the way you think it will, NO MATTER HOW you thought it would!It's an original story in some other ways as well:  (1) It looks at stereotyping from several different angles, not just the standard two or three; (2) the standard 'gruff curmudgeon' authority figure [played by Laurence Fishburne] that is normal fare in these kinds of plots is in this case a very vulnerable person who is willing to let that fact show, and this gives a depth to the story that is usually missing; (3) the 'bad guy' opponent has demons of his own to fight, paralleling in many ways the demon that the protaganist faces.  This gives a complexity to the competitions that is almost always missing in this type of story.The tale revolves around the title character, Akeelah, who lives in southwest Los Angeles, with all of the issues that such a setting implies.  She becomes hooked on 'spelling bees,' and in spite of heavy odds against her participation creates for herself the dream of competing in the national championship that is broadcast on ESPN every year.  It's no spoiler to say that she does indeed get there, surmounting odds of many kinds.  But it *would* be a spoiler to say what happens once she does reach her goal, so I'll remain silent on that point.  (Just remember what I said earlier, about there not being only two possible outcomes to such a plot.)What I won't stay silent about is my enthusiasm for the director, the screenplay, the casting, the editing, and, most of all, the star of this motion picture.  And when I say Star I'm not exaggerating.  Keke Palmer steals this show, from the first instant she appears.  Nor is she merely a very bright child [or very young adult, if you prefer] who can get away with playing herself provided there's an excellent director handy.  There IS an excellent director handy, but no way does she play herself, as will become apparent when you watch the extensive interviews with her that are part of the extras in this package.Since making this movie, she has become quite successful in the music business, as a singer and star of music videos.  But in that genre, she is an entirely different person from the character she portrays in this movie, as well as being yet again distinct from the 'real' Keke in the interviews.  She's a complex person with a multitude of talents, and the producers of this movie are luckier than they can imagine that they found her for the role.  She's PERFECT.The same can't be said for the motion picture as a whole.  For one thing, this type of formulaic plot has become so familiar to us that certain scenes can be 'smelled' long before they show up.  [Credit the editors that they cut one such scene out before the movie was released, though it still exists in the extras on the DVD.]Another problem is that when the 'bad guy' is both a kid and a member of a minority himself, it's hard to stay mad at him for very long, but he does a good job [along with the excellent direction] of keeping the 'bad vibes' flowing as long as he possibly can.As is true of most really good 'children's movies,' this isn't a movie just for children.  There's a lot in it for appreciative adults as well.  I recommend it highly, for viewers of all ages.",4,Not 'Rocky'; Not 'Karate Kid'; Better than either!,1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,3888,"['had', 'always', 'thought', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'possible', 'outcomes', ""'pyramidal"", 'type', 'suspense', 'story', 'type', ""'Rocky"", ""'The"", 'Karate', 'Kid', 'central', 'character', 'ultimate', 'confrontation', 'uplifting', ""'Agony"", 'Defeat', 'type', 'climax', ""'Success"", 'Course', 'type', 'outcome', '[', 'underrated', 'Searching', 'Bobby', 'Fischer', 'excellent', 'example', ']', 'Silly', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'kind', 'ending', 'possible', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'perfect', 'example', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'copied', 'extensively', 'time', 'rolls', 'forward', 'movie', 'first', 'one', 'feature', 'surprise', 'delightful', 'other', 'words', ""n't"", 'end', 'way', 'think', 'will', 'NO', 'MATTER', 'HOW', 'thought', 'would', 'original', 'story', 'other', 'ways', 'well', '1', 'stereotyping', 'several', 'different', 'angles', 'not', 'just', 'standard', 'two', 'three', '2', 'standard', 'curmudgeon', 'authority', 'figure', '[', 'played', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', ']', 'normal', 'fare', 'kinds', 'plots', 'case', 'very', 'vulnerable', 'person', 'who', 'willing', 'let', 'fact', 'show', 'depth', 'story', 'usually', 'missing', '3', ""'bad"", 'guy', 'opponent', 'demons', 'own', 'fight', 'paralleling', 'many', 'ways', 'demon', 'protaganist', 'complexity', 'competitions', 'almost', 'always', 'missing', 'type', 'story.The', 'tale', 'revolves', 'title', 'character', 'Akeelah', 'who', 'southwest', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'issues', 'setting', 'implies', 'hooked', ""'spelling"", 'bees', 'spite', 'heavy', 'odds', 'participation', 'dream', 'competing', 'national', 'championship', 'broadcast', 'ESPN', 'year', 'spoiler', 'say', 'indeed', 'get', 'there', 'surmounting', 'odds', 'many', 'kinds', '*would*', 'be', 'spoiler', 'say', 'what', 'once', 'reach', 'goal', 'so', ""'ll"", 'remain', 'silent', 'point', 'Just', 'remember', 'what', 'said', 'earlier', 'there', 'not', 'being', 'only', 'two', 'possible', 'outcomes', 'such', 'plot', 'What', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stay', 'silent', 'enthusiasm', 'director', 'screenplay', 'casting', 'editing', 'most', 'star', 'motion', 'picture', 'when', 'say', 'Star', ""'m"", 'not', 'exaggerating', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'steals', 'show', 'first', 'instant', 'merely', 'very', 'bright', 'child', '[', 'very', 'young', 'adult', 'prefer', ']', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'playing', 'provided', 'excellent', 'director', 'handy', 'excellent', 'director', 'handy', 'way', 'play', 'will', 'become', 'apparent', 'when', 'watch', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'are', 'part', 'extras', 'package.Since', 'making', 'movie', 'become', 'quite', 'successful', 'music', 'business', 'singer', 'star', 'music', 'videos', 'genre', 'entirely', 'different', 'person', 'character', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'yet', 'again', 'distinct', ""'real"", 'Keke', 'interviews', 'complex', 'person', 'multitude', 'talents', 'producers', 'movie', 'are', 'luckier', 'can', 'imagine', 'found', 'role', 'PERFECT.The', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'motion', 'picture', 'whole', 'one', 'thing', 'type', 'formulaic', 'plot', 'become', 'so', 'familiar', 'certain', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', ""'smelled"", 'long', 'show', 'up', '[', 'Credit', 'editors', 'cut', 'one', 'such', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'still', 'extras', 'DVD', ']', 'problem', 'when', ""'bad"", 'guy', 'kid', 'member', 'minority', 'hard', 'stay', 'mad', 'very', 'long', 'good', 'job', '[', 'excellent', 'direction', ']', 'keeping', ""'bad"", 'vibes', 'flowing', 'as', 'long', 'possibly', 'can.As', 'true', 'most', 'really', 'good', ""'children"", 'movies', ""n't"", 'movie', 'just', 'children', 'lot', 'appreciative', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'recommend', 'highly', 'viewers', 'ages']",N/A
