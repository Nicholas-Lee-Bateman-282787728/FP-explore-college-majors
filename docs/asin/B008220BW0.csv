1542931,A32T2H8150OJLU,B008220BW0,ARH,"[120, 126]","IMO SLEEPER MOVIE OF THE YEAR - PG and awesome!DISCLAIMER: I lived in Santa Cruz 1987-1992.  I do not pretend to be a surfer, because I am not one.  I have, however, done a lot of body surfing and body boarding (boogie boarding) in Hawaii and Santa Cruz.  Plus as a marine biologist I have spent considerable amounts of time near, in, and on the ocean.  With that being said...""Chasing Mavericks"" is probably the best surfing movie I have ever seen.  This biopic of young Jay Moriarity and his mentor Frosty Hesson delves into the psyche and spiritual basis of surfing better than any other surfing movie.Gerard Butler turns in a stellar performance as the sage surfer who reluctantly agrees to train a teenager to surf one of the most dangerous waves in the world - Mavericks.To ""get"" this movie you have to understand this wave.Mavericks is surf break just north of Half Moon Bay, CA.  It breaks only when the surge is big enough and comes from the right direction.  Most offshore breaks occur over reefs that are 20 feet deep or less (e.g., Pipeline, on the north shore of Oahu), but the reef at Mavericks is twice that deep.  This means that it takes a huge wave to break there.In addition to the deep reef at Mavericks, there is an unusual underwater rock formation that helps big waves set up and break.  There is a sloping ramp of rock that approaches the shallow water inshore.  The water to the right and left of this ramp is deep.  The shallower water slows a wave, makes it stand up, and then plunge over explosively.  The deep water on either side keeps the focus of the wave in one location.This combination of factors produces waves that can be 20-80' feet tall, and is one of the most dangerous places to surf in the world.  There are only a few places in the world with waves in this size class.  OK, back to the movie.Young Jay Moriarity, like just about every other surfer along the central California coast those days had heard rumors of a giant wave, but it was dismissed largely as myth.  One day though, Jay discovers someone who rides that wave - Frosty Hesson - and Jay sees the wave and Frosty and his surfing partners ride the wave at Mavericks.  It takes some doing, but Frosty is finally convinced to train Jay for Mavericks.This movie is about what it takes to prepare not to ride a wave like Mavericks, but how to increase your chances of surviving it.  That preparation requires physical, mental, spiritual, etc., development.There is a good dose of surfing in the movie, and while there is a strong mental and spiritual component to the movie, it does not come across as eclectic or preachy.  it's just downright amazing!The sheer force and presence of the wave is awe-inspiring, and the willingness and ability of a small handful of big-wave surfers who challenge it and ride it are beyond impressive.  It borders the miraculous.I mean, I've been held down by a waves in the 6-8' range in Hawaii, so it's nearly impossible to imagine the amount of force in a wave the size of Mavericks.  It's a wave that you feel more than you hear or see it.  Sheer power!This is a movie experience not to be missed!5 stars all the way, and I'll be buying a copy of this movie ASAP.",5,"I just saw Chasing Mavericks, and all I can say is that it was AWESOME",1353196800,"11 18, 2012",2012,3200,"['IMO', 'SLEEPER', 'MOVIE', 'THE', 'YEAR', 'PG', 'awesome', 'DISCLAIMER', 'lived', 'Santa', 'Cruz', '1987-1992', 'do', 'not', 'pretend', 'be', 'surfer', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'have', 'however', 'done', 'lot', 'body', 'surfing', 'body', 'boarding', 'boarding', 'Hawaii', 'Santa', 'Cruz', 'marine', 'biologist', 'have', 'spent', 'considerable', 'amounts', 'time', 'ocean', 'being', 'said', 'Chasing', 'Mavericks', 'probably', 'best', 'surfing', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'biopic', 'young', 'Jay', 'Moriarity', 'mentor', 'Frosty', 'Hesson', 'psyche', 'spiritual', 'basis', 'surfing', 'better', 'other', 'surfing', 'movie.Gerard', 'Butler', 'stellar', 'performance', 'sage', 'surfer', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'train', 'teenager', 'surf', 'one', 'most', 'dangerous', 'waves', 'world', 'Mavericks.To', 'get', 'movie', 'have', 'understand', 'wave.Mavericks', 'surf', 'break', 'just', 'north', 'Half', 'Moon', 'Bay', 'CA', 'only', 'when', 'surge', 'big', 'enough', 'right', 'direction', 'Most', 'offshore', 'breaks', 'occur', 'reefs', 'are', '20', 'feet', 'deep', 'less', 'e.g.', 'Pipeline', 'north', 'shore', 'Oahu', 'reef', 'Mavericks', 'twice', 'deep', 'huge', 'wave', 'break', 'there.In', 'addition', 'deep', 'reef', 'Mavericks', 'unusual', 'underwater', 'rock', 'formation', 'big', 'waves', 'set', 'up', 'break', 'sloping', 'ramp', 'rock', 'shallow', 'water', 'inshore', 'water', 'right', 'left', 'ramp', 'deep', 'shallower', 'water', 'wave', 'stand', 'up', 'then', 'plunge', 'explosively', 'deep', 'water', 'side', 'focus', 'wave', 'one', 'location.This', 'combination', 'factors', 'waves', 'can', 'be', '20-80', 'feet', 'tall', 'one', 'most', 'dangerous', 'places', 'surf', 'world', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'places', 'world', 'waves', 'size', 'class', 'OK', 'back', 'movie.Young', 'Jay', 'Moriarity', 'just', 'other', 'surfer', 'central', 'California', 'coast', 'days', 'had', 'heard', 'rumors', 'giant', 'wave', 'was', 'dismissed', 'largely', 'myth', 'One', 'day', 'Jay', 'someone', 'who', 'wave', 'Frosty', 'Hesson', 'Jay', 'wave', 'Frosty', 'surfing', 'partners', 'ride', 'wave', 'Mavericks', 'doing', 'Frosty', 'finally', 'convinced', 'train', 'Jay', 'Mavericks.This', 'movie', 'what', 'prepare', 'not', 'ride', 'wave', 'Mavericks', 'how', 'increase', 'chances', 'surviving', 'preparation', 'physical', 'mental', 'spiritual', 'etc.', 'good', 'dose', 'surfing', 'movie', 'strong', 'mental', 'spiritual', 'component', 'movie', 'not', 'come', 'eclectic', 'preachy', 'just', 'downright', 'amazing', 'sheer', 'force', 'presence', 'wave', 'awe-inspiring', 'willingness', 'ability', 'small', 'handful', 'big-wave', 'surfers', 'who', 'challenge', 'ride', 'are', 'impressive', 'miraculous.I', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'been', 'held', 'down', 'waves', '6-8', 'range', 'Hawaii', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'amount', 'force', 'wave', 'size', 'Mavericks', 'wave', 'feel', 'more', 'hear', 'see', 'Sheer', 'power', 'movie', 'experience', 'not', 'be', 'missed', '5', 'stars', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'buying', 'copy', 'movie', 'ASAP']",N/A

I loved the cimematography and the mood of the film. It was a very easy to enjoy. The acting was good, as was the script, and the story was just so uplifting. I saved it for my family to see and I've recommended it to others as well. A great story about a VERY young man who decided to throttle the waves!  A great father-son movie that had  wonderful messages about how important a father REALLY is in a young boys life, regardless of what the PC people say today. A FATHER can make all the difference in a childs life, just as a mother can as well. But only a dad can fill that position in a boys life. This was a great movie about love, friendship, drive, committment, and courage.I've seen some rather unkind reviews of this film and my personal opini is that they didn't understand the idea of it. If you want a purely surfer dude movie, this is NOT it, nor did they advertise it as such. I saw the previews of this, and it WAS described exactly as they delivered. This had a surfing theme and element, but it was more about the training, the emotional bond that developed between Jay and Frosty, and how he overcame certain obsticles. I, personally, would've found it extrememly boring if it had focused totally on surfing, as it wouldn't have done the film, or the story, justice.

Storywise it's basically a bit of a mix between North Shore and The Karate Kid but a bit more realistic since, well, most of this stuff incredibly really happened shortly after the spotlight for big-wave surfing had turned from Waimea Bay and Todos Santos up to Mavericks. Like most Hollywood surf movies it has its share of necessary cheese here and there to drive the story along, but overall it's a film as solid as the surf it depicts that surfers and non-surfers can enjoy and be moved and inspired by. The soundtrack is perfect for that moment in surf history (Sponge, Mazzy Star, Butthole Surfers, The Offspring, Matthew Sweet), and the cameos by big-wave chargers like Peter Mel and Greg Long provide the necessary credibility and access for the project. Also just figured out Frosty's wife is played by Abigail Spencer watching Jimmy Kimmel whose brother is Sterling Spencer (just featured in Surfer Magazine) of the Spencer family which is Gulf Coast surf royalty (Yancy Spencer III, Yancy Spencer IV, founders of Innerlight Surf Shop - most surfers will likely recognize these names).

The challenge of riding a 35 foot wave seems impossible.  Fear is good and panic is bad. The first rule was to build a thesis, write and essay, and reflect on the holes.  Theory, observation, and inspiration combine with courage come together with raw talent to ride the maverick.  The movie has a strong tension with the abandonment by the father, the surrogate son adoption, the training by padding 36 miles, 4 minute holding breath, the death of the wife, the attempt self destruction, the suffering of the children, and the betrayal by drug peddler friend.  There are numerous themes running between good and evil. The mother inability to keep a job forces a double shift at the pizza restaurant, the drug lords bully tactics implied a network of evil, and the resolution to forgive his father provide a opportunity to become great.  The ocean scenery was a camera delight.  The feel of the ocean was an observer choice,  The characters were like able. The mother seemed to be anti climatic.  This was not another karate kid.  It was a new look at an surfing icon and legend.Why can investors learn from watching ""chasing mavericks""?  A maverick wave contains thousands of tons of water.  The wave currents can change unexpectedly.  The investor can never completely gather all the information relating to his theory. Skill and talent is helpful but not enough. You need to have spiritual and moral strength to survive.  It is possible to surf a maverick wave, but you will be one of only a handful of people capable of winning.  For the most part, 99 percent of the surfers will never try riding the wave.  To ride the wave, you must have a mind like a PHd, observing pattern, thinking about the data, creating theories that make the observations make sense, and be willing to test the theory.  However, in the end, you may not survive.  Sometimes, it is wise not to try and sometimes it is wise to find a more meanful means of focusing ones interest.  In any case, you must have a plan.  The plan must be based on well understood theory and experience.  Learn from your mistakes, don't panic, and work hard to win.

I always thought you'd have to be crazy to surf those 30 feet waves.  Jay was barely 16 years old.This film doesn't just center around the quest to surf the ""Big Wave Mavericks"" (like Laird Hamilton's Riding Giants - which I thought was a good documentary).  Chasing Mavericks ended up being a bit of a tear-jerker for me.  It was also an adrenalin rush (watched it about a half hour ago and I still feel a little rush).But I think that's because I'm really drawn to water sports and just the ocean period.  I've lived in Southern California all my life.  I was body surfering in the 90's before it was popular.  Now, I miss doing that, but still try to get some swim time in either the pools or beaches.  I love the feel of the push-pull of the waves.There are few surfering movies that I like. And now, I thinkChasing MavericksandIn God's Handsare my favorite NON-documentary surfing movie.  Meaning a film that is built more on the characters, than the sport.  Sure there are lots of good documentary surfing films to watch.  But I like Docu-dramas more.The soundtrack was very nostalgic for me. A early 90's best of soundtrack.I chose to watch this movie because 1) I'm still waiting for the movie Rush, 2) this is one of those films where the actors does their own stunts.  In this case, Gerard and other actors showed some good Big Wave surfing capabilities. And I didn't know until one interview, that Gerard had nearly drowned and was hospitalized during the production of the film.  So, yes, surfing is a very dangerous sport.",5,Live like Jay,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,1997,"['Chasing', 'Mavericks', '5', '9733', '9829', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'American', 'surfer', 'Jay', 'Moriarity', 'So', 'film', 'more', 'Jay', 'mentor', 'Frosty', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'surfing', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'great', 'sports', 'film', 'very', 'inspirational', 'showed', 'how', 'young', 'age', 'Jay', 'passion', 'big', 'waves', 'Mavericks', 'setting', 'Santa', 'Cruz', 'California', 'Northern', 'California', 'height', 'El', 'Ni', 'ntilde', 'o', '1994', 'always', 'thought', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'crazy', 'surf', '30', 'feet', 'waves', 'Jay', 'was', 'barely', '16', 'years', 'old.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'just', 'center', 'around', 'quest', 'surf', 'Big', 'Wave', 'Mavericks', 'Laird', 'Hamilton', 'Riding', 'Giants', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'documentary', 'Chasing', 'Mavericks', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'bit', 'tear-jerker', 'was', 'also', 'adrenalin', 'rush', 'watched', 'half', 'hour', 'still', 'feel', 'little', 'rush', '.But', 'think', ""'m"", 'really', 'drawn', 'water', 'sports', 'just', 'ocean', 'period', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'Southern', 'California', 'life', 'was', 'body', 'surfering', '90', 'was', 'popular', 'Now', 'miss', 'doing', 'still', 'try', 'get', 'swim', 'time', 'pools', 'beaches', 'love', 'feel', 'push-pull', 'waves.There', 'are', 'few', 'surfering', 'movies', 'like', 'now', 'thinkChasing', 'MavericksandIn', 'God', 'Handsare', 'favorite', 'NON-documentary', 'surfing', 'movie', 'Meaning', 'film', 'built', 'more', 'characters', 'sport', 'Sure', 'are', 'lots', 'good', 'documentary', 'surfing', 'films', 'watch', 'like', 'Docu-dramas', 'more.The', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'very', 'nostalgic', 'early', '90', 'best', 'soundtrack.I', 'chose', 'watch', 'movie', '1', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'movie', 'Rush', '2', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'actors', 'own', 'stunts', 'case', 'Gerard', 'other', 'actors', 'showed', 'good', 'Big', 'Wave', 'surfing', 'capabilities', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'interview', 'Gerard', 'had', 'nearly', 'drowned', 'was', 'hospitalized', 'production', 'film', 'So', 'yes', 'surfing', 'very', 'dangerous', 'sport']",N/A

A.Frosty (Gerard Butler) is an aging surfer who mostly neglects his wife and daughter.  If he's not working (repairs stuff), he's surfing with his buddies.  Living across the street is young Jay (Cooper Timberline then Jonny Weston) whose father leaves him and his alcoholic mother (Elisabeth Shue).  Eventually Frosty fills that role and agrees to mentor Jay so that he can ride the ""Mavericks"" that will eventually show up.  It's kind of like the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi in ""The Karate Kid.""  All of the time is in training not surfing.  This includes writing long essays, but not about his crush on an older girl (Leven Rambin).Alas, the film is full of clich&eacute;s and has a boilerplate script.  But Weston is cute and Butler is hunky, so I suspect the film hit its target pretty well.

It focuses mostly on Jay's character and his relationship with Frosty, not just on surfing, which I think kept it off the chopping block.  It also does a good job of explaining, and showing, how dangerous Mavericks really are.Gerard Butler should not have played Frosty though, in my opinion.  He is a good actor, and I love a lot of his work, but I don't really think this role was for him (to show what I mean, I think Matthew McConaughey would've been perfect here).  He is really the only big name in the film, other than Elizabeth Shue (if you can count her anymore), so he probably anchored it for marketing purposes.Mad props to Jonny Weston, though, he did a really good job as the naive teen who just wants to get out there and surf but gets pulled into all this drama and bull-crap with his mom, his love interest, and his best friend.  I didn't know who Jay Moriarity was before this film and it was at least good enough to make me research this guy afterwards.What brought this movie down to a 3 for me was just general, nit-picky stuff (like Butler playing Frosty), so I won't waste your time with it here (as you may not agree with it all).

1543041,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B008220BW0,Ranny Levy,"[5, 5]","This movie is based on a true story that will inspire the audience. Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston) is raised by a single mom (Elizabeth Shue) who is never around. He almost died of drowning when he was younger and Frosty Hesson (the local surfing legend) saved him. Since that day, Jay follows Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler) and notices that Frosty often goes out very early in the morning. One day, Jay follow Frosty to see what he's doing out so early in the morning. On this trip Jay discovers the secret place where some of the local surfer legends surf. Frosty tells him that the biggest wave will come to this spot one day. He asks Frosty to help him train to ride the biggest waves. During the training process many life events happen and it turns out that Jay is helping Frosty as much as Frosty is helping him. They build a father and son bond.This movie has so many different emotions. There are the relationships between a Jay and his mom, Jay and his first crush, Jay and his best friend and Jay and his father-figure neighbor. There is so much awesome footage of the waves and the surfing culture that the audience can really enjoy watching while learning. The music is so perfect for all the scenes, especially with the skateboarders and surfers. The scenes of the 80s and the small town lifestyle is awesome to see. The special effects in this movie are above average. The big wipe out captured in this movie is like no other picture I've seen.  The message in this movie is never give up. Sometimes it is so much work to achieve your goals, but if you practice everyday, you will be better than yesterday. My favorite characters are Jay and Frosty. Jay is so friendly and never hold grudges; he always forgives. Frosty is a great surfer with a big heart. I rank this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I recommend this for ages 7 and up. Cheyenne N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.I recently watched Chasing Mavericks and really enjoyed it. I saw it with my mom and she even cried in some parts; everyone needs a good movie to cry in sometimes. Throughout this entire movie, I obsessed over the main character, Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston.) He is just so adorable in the whole movie. I did a little research on the story; and it is pretty accurate. I have never really watched movies primarily filmed in water, but I think it makes the acting and storyline more intense, which I like.This movie is about a fifteen-year-old boy name Jay Moriarity who, since he was eight, has been passionate about waves and surfing. It all starts when he was timing the swell of the waves to determine how large they were and fell in. His later mentor, Frosty (Gerard Butler) saved him and ever since he is always in the water. One day Jay hops onto Frosty's truck and follows him to a place where he sees the biggest waves existing - known to be a myth, the Mavericks. Jay begs Frosty to train him to surf the Mavericks. Frosty agrees and they spend everyday intensely training. Jay has had a hard life; his dad left him, and he acts as a mother to his struggling mother. But, he is very optimistic - which is inspiring. This movie portrays Jay as a good role model, showing how to find happiness in spite of everything.I have now seen this movie twice because it was so good! I probably will soon watch it again. All of the acting is great, and from researching the cast I found out that the main character Jonny Weston (Jay Moriarity) is a new actor. He was amazing in this movie. Even though this movie is based on a true story, it feels unreal because the life of Jay is inspiring, and hard to believe that someone could be that positive. Also there is a good soundtrack. It is the first movie where I actually noticed the sound track. Usually it does not jump out at me, but this time it does. I give this movie five out of five stars because it held my attention the entire time. I recommend it for ages six and up because smaller children might get bored by a long movie Victoria B., KIDS FIRST! Film CriticThe surf is up and we are heading to the ocean for this amazing movie. The movie, based on the real life experience of Jay Moriarty, played by new-comer Jonny Weston. Jay moves to Santa Cruz, California when he is 9 and learns to surf from a boy he befriends. He is drawn to the waves and the ocean. He counts the seconds between the breakers for fun. Once he learns to surf and has made a name for himself as a good local surfer he meets a legendary big wave surfer named Frosty Henderson, played by Gerrard Butler.The cinematography is hypnotizing. Some of the shots of the ocean and surfing are more then incredible. Your eyes are glued to the screen from the beginning to the end and you can make a really strong connection to surfers and surfing as a lifestyle. Some people call it sour surfing and Jay Moriarty was the youngest and the best. In the movie they show the relationship between Jay and Frosty as having only being a few weeks of training seasons but in real life Frosty trained Jay for years before his first attempt at riding a Maverick. These waves can be 50 feet high and are very dangerous. There are so many things that can go wrong. Having us believe that all the training happened in one small stretch of weeks would be impossible but that's just Hollywood telling the story.Go watch this touching story and bring a friend but leave the boards outside. You don't have to surf to enjoy the movie but it could open your eyes to a glimpse of what some of these amazing athletes will do for the sport. Once you see it, you will know why once you start, the ocean is always calling you to back to play again. I think I would love to learn to surf but I will stick with the small waves. The age range is 9 and up but really the photography in the movie will keep anybody entertained. I give it 4 1/2 out of 5 twinkling stars. Morgan B, KIDS FIRST!

1543065,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B008220BW0,Steve Douglas,"[2, 3]","If you read any of the other reviews here on this movie you already know that it was a wonderful sleeper movie both inspiring and engrossing.  All my many reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the film from Standard Def DVD quality to the higher standard set for Blu Ray. Summaries of the plot and opinions of the story line and acting can be found in the majority of the other reviews so I do not want to be redundant.Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is also dependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using. The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65&#34; plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective.Just so I won't be redundant this review and its 5 star rating is based strictly upon the actual quality of its transfer to Blu Ray.VIDEO.....The video transfer is just great in most every way.  Color grading is very natural looking with true skin tones, realistic lighting and excellent contrast.  Small details, even in a characters hair, are easily discerned and, in darker scenes you are presented with true blacks.  This is the type of film where transfer issues such as banding in sky scenes and artifacts or loss of details in the waves could easily have become an issue.  You get none of that.  The sky shots are crystal clear and wave action very detailed even in the droplets.  There really is some outstanding footage of the ocean in this film and as an underwater videographer I can truly appreciate the many superb shots.  Yes, some of it was CGI, but you would never be able to tell.  I only know of the slight CGI because of one of the extras.  Mbps rate appeared to average in the mid to high 30's and the higher bit rate contributes to the finer imaging you see.AUDIO.....I love that more and more BluRay DVDs are coming with a 7.1 sound mix. This Blu Ray defaults to a lossless DTS HD MA 7.1 audio presentation which is what my home theater system is, but If your system is a 5.1 system, not to fret, the additional 6th and 7th channels will be muxed to feed into your 4th and 5th rear channels without any issues.  Dialogue is crystal clear and very transparent even when characters are talking in near whispers.  What sets this audio presentation apart is that the surrounds are used not so much for specific and discreet audio coming from one of the front or rear surrounds but from the incredible sound of the ocean's breaking waves, humongous in size, that seem to break over and around you.  The audio steering is quite excellent and immerses you , especially so, in the many ocean scenes.  I do hope you have a great sub woofer as this film's audio digs deep and goes even deeper with bottom end audio that will test the limits of your LFE channel.  I loved every crash of each wave and how I was completely immersed in the ocean's power.  5+ stars for the audio.  Spanish, French, Portuguese language alternatives are included.EXTRAS....Aside from an advertisement for the quality of Blu Ray and a couple of disc space wasting previews of other films which force you to pay for the companies advertising and creates the need for even more compression of the film you are paying for, the other extras are excellent.There are several deleted scenes which I always enjoy but, after watching them, I can understand why they were not included as they steered the film in other directions.  There was a great documentary on both the life of real Jay Moriarty with real footage of him as well as those with whom he grew up with including his mentor, Frosty, and his wife.  I found extremely interesting the feature of how they were able to film the shots that were so difficult to get and how they also used the blue screen to complete a couple of clips.  Another doc was on the town of Santa Cruz, the Zen of Surfing and more.  You are also provided with an Ultra Violet redemption code.This is just another reason why I dislike UV.  I just went to the address provided to redeem my copy of Chasing Mavericks.  The page came up and the film wasn&#8217;t even there, lots of other films but not the one I paid for.  It advised me to check my spelling, which I did and had everything correct.

Michael Apted completed the film). I tried to like ""Chasing Mavericks"" starring Gerard Butler as Frosty Hesson, a Santa Cruz surfer taking under his wing a young and ambitious surfer Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston), but somehow I felt something is not quite right with the result.""Chasing Mavericks"" follows the story of Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston), who despite all disadvantages, intends to surf the Mavericks in Northern California, which is one of most dangerous surf spots in the world. Frosty Hesson reluctantly agrees to teach the young surfer.It's a great story. With Gerard Butler and stunning surf scenes, the film could have been much more emotionally involving, but somehow ""Chasing Mavericks"" lacks passion those characters should have. Some episodes are rather clich&eacute;d (the one involving a dog in the opening is a good example). The mentor/surrogate father-like relationship between the two main characters is not fully explored.

It shows how it is sport that involves a love of the ocean.  It also show the positive side of the folks who participate.  Surfers are often shown as lazy druggies who are pretty much a drag on society.  Jay Moriarity is far from that portrait in this film.
