1625532,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00BCMSZPC,A. Burchfield,"[2, 2]","I'd heard of K-9 in reading on the web about actress Philippa Coulthard (also in &#34;Alien Surf Girls&#34;) and searched for it because I thought it sounded interesting- found only an Australian DVD offering. SyFy then ran a Christmas Day marathon, didn't look too bad (what I saw of it) and that Australian DVD set was all I could find so I bought that (paid way too much, judging by Amazon's quoted price).I'm about half way through it and wish I'd known that the set would be available in the U.S. format, I'd have saved some money.The production values are pretty good for a 30 minute kid's show but you'd almost need to be a kid to really like it. Set in London at some future, but not so distant date, the &#34;look&#34; is never really right (one episode does show the London skyline in the background in addition to stock aerial footage)- never a sense that you're actually in London. The storylines, that I've watched, are more juvenile than the usual Doctor Who stories&#8230;too much so for some people. Sets have a way of looking cheaper as well.Other than character profiles I got no extras in the Australian edition.If you've got the Australian DVD set, the U.S. release is just not worth the extra money you'll spend just to get &#34;our&#34; format. I hope the U.S. packaging (it looks a little different) is better than Australia's. In that one the discs snap in one over the other in pairs, and fit so tightly I keep expecting to break something.If you aren't a Doctor Who fan who must have &#34;everything&#34; I'd say skip the thing and buy something else.",3,"You really need to be a ""Who"" fan for this one&#8230; at least it's cheaper than Australian release",1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,1577,"[""'d"", 'heard', 'K-9', 'reading', 'web', 'actress', 'Philippa', 'Coulthard', 'also', '34', 'Alien', 'Surf', 'Girls', '34', 'searched', 'thought', 'sounded', 'interesting-', 'found', 'only', 'Australian', 'DVD', 'offering', 'SyFy', 'then', 'ran', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'marathon', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'bad', 'what', 'saw', 'Australian', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'could', 'find', 'so', 'bought', 'paid', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'judging', 'Amazon', 'quoted', 'price', ""'m"", 'way', 'wish', ""'d"", 'known', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'available', 'U.S.', 'format', ""'d"", 'have', 'saved', 'money.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', '30', 'minute', 'kid', 'show', ""'d"", 'almost', 'need', 'be', 'kid', 'really', 'like', 'Set', 'London', 'future', 'not', 'so', 'distant', 'date', '34', 'look', '34', 'never', 'really', 'right', 'one', 'episode', 'show', 'London', 'skyline', 'background', 'addition', 'stock', 'aerial', 'footage', 'never', 'sense', ""'re"", 'actually', 'London', 'storylines', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'are', 'more', 'juvenile', 'usual', 'Doctor', 'Who', '8230', 'too', 'much', 'people', 'Sets', 'have', 'way', 'looking', 'cheaper', 'well.Other', 'character', 'profiles', 'got', 'extras', 'Australian', 'edition.If', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Australian', 'DVD', 'set', 'U.S.', 'release', 'just', 'not', 'extra', 'money', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'just', 'get', '34', '34', 'format', 'hope', 'U.S.', 'packaging', 'little', 'different', 'better', 'Australia', 'one', 'discs', 'snap', 'one', 'other', 'pairs', 'fit', 'so', 'tightly', 'keep', 'expecting', 'break', 'something.If', 'are', ""n't"", 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fan', 'who', 'must', 'have', '34', 'everything', '34', ""'d"", 'say', 'skip', 'thing', 'buy', 'something', 'else']",K-9: The Complete Series

1625540,A243HY69GIAHFI,B00BCMSZPC,tropic_of_criticism,"[0, 0]","The product description and several of the reviews here suggest that this is a DOCTOR WHO spin-off.It's not.Don't buy this product if you believe that it continues any K9 storyline from DOCTOR WHO.  It doesn't.  Don't buy it if you think you're going to learn some kind of backstory about the character of K9 as depicted on DOCTOR WHO.  You won't.  Don't buy it if you think it's going to at least give you the character of K9.  It can't.The truth is that the copyright situation forced the production team into making the dog and his situation far, far removed from DOCTOR WHO. And they did such a good job of avoiding a lawsuit from the BBC &#8212; who, it must be stressed, are not the producers of this wreck &#8212;that K9 is occasionally quite out of character with his DOCTOR WHO universe self. Many capabilities and speech patterns exhibited by K9 in this series are completely novel TO this series.  Sometimes, the differences are so egregious that it's are to reconcile this K9 with the BBC's K9.So. This is, for all intents and purposes, a completely free-standing show that has nothing to do with DOCTOR WHO. It is mainly about a group of kids you've never met before fighting a series of enemies you don't know, under the direction of an adult character who is vaguely &#34;Doctor-ish&#34;, but whose quirks aren't so much charming as genuine social disorders.Intrigued?  I thought not.  Still, I'll go on.From a DOCTOR WHO fan's perspective, there is really nothing here for you, aside from the fact that they employed John Leeson, who originated the voice of K9.  Oddly, it wouldn't even be fair to say that it's a place to view the scripts of Bob Baker, because he only wrote a couple of late-season episodes.And that could have worked, if it were handled by other Australian producers.  After all, Australia has a strong and well-deserved reputation for making interesting live-action shows for tweens.  But this ain't one of them.It's got a fairly low standard of acting and directing, and the story that's being told is often confusing.  I'm still unsure what the central adversary &#8212;the Department &#8212;really was.  I think it was just meant to be, vaguely, government run amuck &#8212; and that's why we never find out what it's &#34;the Department&#34; of.  We're just meant to accept that the Department is trying to put the kids down, suppressing individuality and freedom of expression along the way.  How did such an oppressive, authoritarian government agency come to exist in London's future?  That's as much of a mystery as why the production team set the thing in London in the first place.  The story really didn't have to be in London at all.  And because they were filming in Australia, it SHOULDN'T have been.  No part of Australia can truly double for London, and this is painfully obvious in many scenes.  There's just nothing comparable to the Thames down under, and yet the writing staff oddly choose to set several scenes explicitly on that river.  As a result, the scenes completely disallow the suspension of disbelief.It's hard for me to say what audiences would like this thing.  None of the major characters have particularly interesting character arcs.  Genuine action scenes are few and quite definitely far between.  There's a little bit of romance between the kid actors but it never goes much beyond a single kiss in a mid season episode.  And the monsters are mostly of the &#34;men in a rubber suit&#34; variety.That leaves the show with nothing much going for it, beyond curiosity.  The interest in this series essentially boils down to the question of how K9 works divorced from DOCTOR WHO, or &#8212;if you're just a general kids show fan &#8212;how LASSIE can be remade with a robotic dog instead of a collie.Unfortunately for this show, the answer to both questions is, &#34;not very well&#34;.",1,The mutt that should have stayed in the kennel,1405814400,"07 20, 2014",2014,3857,"['product', 'description', 'several', 'reviews', 'here', 'suggest', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'spin-off.It', 'not.Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'product', 'believe', 'K9', 'storyline', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', ""n't"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'think', ""'re"", 'going', 'learn', 'kind', 'backstory', 'character', 'K9', 'depicted', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'think', 'going', 'least', 'give', 'character', 'K9', ""can't.The"", 'truth', 'copyright', 'situation', 'forced', 'production', 'team', 'making', 'dog', 'situation', 'far', 'far', 'removed', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'avoiding', 'lawsuit', 'BBC', '8212', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'stressed', 'are', 'not', 'producers', 'wreck', '8212', 'K9', 'occasionally', 'quite', 'character', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'self', 'Many', 'capabilities', 'speech', 'patterns', 'exhibited', 'K9', 'series', 'are', 'completely', 'novel', 'TO', 'series', 'Sometimes', 'differences', 'are', 'so', 'egregious', 'are', 'reconcile', 'K9', 'BBC', 'K9.So', 'intents', 'purposes', 'completely', 'free-standing', 'show', 'nothing', 'do', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'mainly', 'group', 'kids', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met', 'fighting', 'series', 'enemies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'direction', 'adult', 'character', 'who', 'vaguely', '34', 'Doctor-ish', '34', 'quirks', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'charming', 'genuine', 'social', 'disorders.Intrigued', 'thought', 'not', 'Still', ""'ll"", 'go', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'fan', 'perspective', 'really', 'nothing', 'here', 'aside', 'fact', 'employed', 'John', 'Leeson', 'who', 'originated', 'voice', 'K9', 'Oddly', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'fair', 'say', 'place', 'view', 'scripts', 'Bob', 'Baker', 'only', 'wrote', 'couple', 'late-season', 'episodes.And', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'were', 'handled', 'other', 'Australian', 'producers', 'Australia', 'strong', 'well-deserved', 'reputation', 'making', 'interesting', 'live-action', 'shows', 'tweens', 'ai', ""n't"", 'one', 'them.It', 'got', 'fairly', 'low', 'standard', 'acting', 'directing', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'often', 'confusing', ""'m"", 'still', 'unsure', 'what', 'central', 'adversary', '8212', 'Department', '8212', 'really', 'was', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'meant', 'be', 'vaguely', 'government', 'run', 'amuck', '8212', 'why', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'what', '34', 'Department', '34', ""'re"", 'just', 'meant', 'accept', 'Department', 'trying', 'put', 'kids', 'down', 'suppressing', 'individuality', 'freedom', 'expression', 'way', 'How', 'did', 'oppressive', 'authoritarian', 'government', 'agency', 'come', 'exist', 'London', 'future', 'as', 'much', 'mystery', 'why', 'production', 'team', 'set', 'thing', 'London', 'first', 'place', 'story', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'London', 'were', 'filming', 'Australia', 'SHOULD', ""N'T"", 'have', 'been', 'part', 'Australia', 'can', 'truly', 'double', 'London', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'many', 'scenes', 'just', 'nothing', 'comparable', 'Thames', 'down', 'yet', 'writing', 'staff', 'oddly', 'choose', 'set', 'several', 'scenes', 'explicitly', 'river', 'result', 'scenes', 'completely', 'suspension', 'disbelief.It', 'hard', 'say', 'what', 'audiences', 'would', 'like', 'thing', 'None', 'major', 'characters', 'have', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'character', 'arcs', 'Genuine', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'quite', 'definitely', 'far', 'little', 'bit', 'romance', 'kid', 'actors', 'never', 'much', 'single', 'kiss', 'mid', 'season', 'episode', 'monsters', 'are', 'mostly', '34', 'men', 'rubber', 'suit', '34', 'show', 'nothing', 'much', 'going', 'curiosity', 'interest', 'series', 'essentially', 'down', 'question', 'how', 'K9', 'divorced', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', '8212', ""'re"", 'just', 'general', 'kids', 'show', 'fan', '8212', 'how', 'LASSIE', 'can', 'be', 'remade', 'robotic', 'dog', 'instead', 'collie.Unfortunately', 'show', 'answer', 'questions', '34', 'not', 'very', 'well', '34']",K-9: The Complete Series
