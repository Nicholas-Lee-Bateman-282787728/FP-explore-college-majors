1194186,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B001GCUNYO,,"[0, 0]","Liam Neeson has a way of speaking his lines and carrying himself that I like. I don't know where Liam is from but for some reason I like him as an actor. That said, this movie really doesn't offer much. I truly enjoyed the action part of the movie. I love how Neeson's character wasted no time in simply killing scumbags. That is the way I would do it, if I was put in such a situation or that is the way I would want to do it. Sure, in a real world you'd probably simply get killed in your first encounter with such dangerous scumbags. So it's nice to go to fantasy land where one guy can become an army of one. So, I really enjoyed the killing of scum but the rest of the movie was awful.Neeson's daughter in this movie is that gal who I loathed from the tv show LOST. Now granted, in LOST the actresses's part was supposed to be loathsome. So to that extent the actress played her part well in LOST. But in Taken we are supposed to believe the actress is a teenager, that she is worth saving and so on. I didn't find the character to be worth saving. The girl was living a new life with her wife's new husband. Neeson's character bought the daughter a Karaoke machine while the new sugar daddy bought his new daughter a horse. And the wife was quite loathsome as well. Why would this character who is cast as a loser even care about such people. And there was no chemistry between Neeson's character, his daughter and the ex-wife. The plot is so thin and everything is completely predictable. I never was at a loss for anything. Everything was laid out like a 200 thread count sheet. The plot was weak, weak, weak. The family was weak, weak, weak. It was just so obvious that the director was throwing up a family so they could get to the action scenes which were fun. And I don't know but perhaps Neeson is also to blame for the family stuff not working. Maybe a more accomplished actor could have made the family more believable but I didn't believe this so called family, or ex family for one minute. To me the family was just stage and prop. So I'm saying the movie has no depth. The movie was lame.

Bryan is also a divorced, very divorced from his ex-wife's perspective, parent of a precocious teenage daughter with singing aspirations and a yen to head to Europe, Paris first stop, in order to follow the international rock group U-2 (?-for a 2008 teenager but we will let that pass). Those Bryan honed spy skills turned out to come in very handy, once he relented and let that wayward daughter head to Europe. See almost as soon as she (and her dippy friend, her older girlfriend) , as single good-looking teenagers on the loose, are spotted and violently kidnapped by a nefarious international gang of white-slavers who are looking to place young girls in their whorehouses or sell them off to the highest bidder.Thus, we have the perfect storm between a man with a ruthless set of spy skills and a previously neglected daughter in distress and Bryan must use every one of them before he is through. The bulk of the film revolves around Bryan chasing, hitting, shooting, beating, torturing, shooting (oh, I said that), interrogating, driving, leaping, mano y mano fighting, and just plain being a mal hombre as he works his way through the litany of bad guy involved in the white-slave trade from lowly thuggish Albanians (who seemingly collectively cannot fight off one guy) to middle- man pimp daddy French society figures to paid off French security agents to oil-soaked depraved sheiks who specialize in deflowering young girls before he saves his still chaste daughter (naturally) and sends her back to California and a grateful mother, and more respectful ex-wife.Recently in reviewing another protective parent drama, 2001s The Deep End,  I noted that I had been listening to a ""high brow"" talking- head discussion about the sea-change that has been occurring in the way American parenting has evolved over the past thirty years or so (the speakers however covered themselves with the caveat that this trend excluded certain ethnic, racial, cultural and class exceptions, in short, this was about how middle, now middle, and upper class parents raise their progeny the cohort of that and this film). The gist of the argument was that the new ""coddle"" generation (say those under thirty, okay) have never learned to fail, their parents have never allowed them to experience failure, and therefore they have never learned how to fly out of the nest unaided and therefore are ill-equipped to face the wicked old world and its snares.

We've seen Liam in action before, notably so in Rob Roy, and even The Phantom Menace, but never at this level.At 56 years old, Liam proves he has not lost any of his edge.  One of my favorite aspects of Taken is the realism.  Of course, take that word with a grain of salt as I am talking comparitively.  Compared to other actioners, Taken let's you believe what is happening could really happen.  It is not so over-stylized that, while fun to watch, is not believeable.  THis is due in large part to the coreography of the fights.  Coreographer Olivier Schneider relies heavily on the reality based and brutal martial art of Silat.  Silat is a no-nonsense martial art, with strikes that are meant to stop an attacker in his tracks, not to show off.This film has been compared a lot to Bourne Identity.  Personally, I think Taken is better; for two reasons.  First, it has more heart, and based on the very serious matter of trafficking.  Second, the action scenes are not edited so quickly that you can't see what is happening.  With Bourne, the fights are edited so quickly that you get the FEEL of action, without actually seeing as much of the techniques.As mentioned, I appreciate the awareness Taken brings to the very real problem of human trafficking, especially with young girls and the sex trade.  The film is great action with a great story, and made that much better by exposing an important social justice issue.

The movie is straightforward and simple, almost quaintly so in an era where we've come to expect every movie to have a dramatic twist ending in which it turns out that an ancillary character (the best friend? the aging husband? the bitter wife?) was the actual mastermind behind everything. ""Taken"" has no such twists, partly because they've become a bit overdone in the movie industry, but mostly because such a twist would have undermined Neeson's hard-earned 'I told you so' as well as the (probably unintentional) movie subtext that pretty young women should never leave their fathers' homes - or for that matter the motherland.Indeed, it's difficult to say how much of the movie is meant to be a searing attack on women... Neeson's ex-wife palatably drips evil and malice, and his darling daughter is almost a caricature of the stereotypical spoiled brat - throwing a temper tantrum that would shame a three-year-old when Daddy doesn't instantly sign off on an exotic European getaway. When the daughter and girlfriend are kidnapped into white slavery for being imprudent enough to flirt with an attractive stranger on a busy street in a foreign country, the sexually active girl dies almost immediately and is never mentioned again in the film. Neeson's daughter, on the other hand, is a pure-as-the-driven-snow virgin, allowing him a crucial extra few hours to try to save her as she is shuttled off to the expensive and exclusive 'virgin auction'. Although I'm probably reading WAY too much into the movie with all this subtext - after all, this is supposed to be a fun, mindless shoot-em-up, not a dissertation on the evils of society.All tongue-in-cheek aside, ""Taken"" is a fine action movie if you're just looking for people to get blown up, shot, and run over by cars. Quite a few of the characters fail to act sensibly (like the slave-trader who is uncooperative for no reason at all except as a method to work in a torture scene), and some of the action feels a bit too pretentious - like a deliberate attempt to push the envelope. For example, when Neeson shots innocent people in order to get their loved ones to cooperate - the action doesn't make sense and simply doesn't fit the character, but we're out to push buttons here, not build a believable storyline. I recommend ""Taken"" for a fun, mindless action movie to pass the time, but I wouldn't waste too much time trying to find sense in it - this is a spectacle movie, not a philosophical one.~ Ana Mardoll",4,Mindlessly Exciting Action,1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,2618,"['Taken', '/', 'B001TODCII*Spoilers*I', 'think', 'probably', 'safe', 'say', 'one', 'going', 'be', 'terribly', 'surprised', 'thought-provoked', 'Taken', 'movie', 'straightforward', 'simple', 'almost', 'quaintly', 'so', 'era', 'where', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'movie', 'have', 'dramatic', 'twist', 'ending', 'out', 'ancillary', 'character', 'best', 'friend', 'aging', 'husband', 'bitter', 'wife', 'was', 'actual', 'mastermind', 'everything', 'Taken', 'such', 'twists', 'partly', ""'ve"", 'become', 'bit', 'overdone', 'movie', 'industry', 'mostly', 'twist', 'would', 'have', 'undermined', 'Neeson', 'hard-earned', 'told', 'so', 'as', 'well', 'probably', 'unintentional', 'movie', 'subtext', 'pretty', 'young', 'women', 'should', 'never', 'leave', 'fathers', 'homes', 'matter', 'motherland.Indeed', 'difficult', 'say', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'searing', 'attack', 'women', 'Neeson', 'ex-wife', 'palatably', 'evil', 'malice', 'darling', 'daughter', 'almost', 'caricature', 'stereotypical', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'throwing', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'would', 'shame', 'three-year-old', 'when', 'Daddy', ""n't"", 'instantly', 'sign', 'off', 'exotic', 'European', 'getaway', 'When', 'daughter', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'white', 'slavery', 'being', 'imprudent', 'enough', 'flirt', 'attractive', 'stranger', 'busy', 'street', 'foreign', 'country', 'sexually', 'active', 'girl', 'almost', 'immediately', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'film', 'Neeson', 'daughter', 'other', 'hand', 'pure-as-the-driven-snow', 'virgin', 'allowing', 'crucial', 'extra', 'few', 'hours', 'try', 'save', 'shuttled', 'off', 'expensive', 'exclusive', ""'virgin"", 'auction', ""'m"", 'probably', 'reading', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'subtext', 'supposed', 'be', 'fun', 'mindless', 'shoot-em-up', 'not', 'dissertation', 'evils', 'society.All', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'aside', 'Taken', 'fine', 'action', 'movie', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'people', 'get', 'blown', 'up', 'shot', 'run', 'over', 'cars', 'few', 'characters', 'fail', 'act', 'sensibly', 'slave-trader', 'who', 'uncooperative', 'reason', 'method', 'work', 'torture', 'scene', 'action', 'bit', 'too', 'pretentious', 'deliberate', 'attempt', 'push', 'envelope', 'example', 'when', 'Neeson', 'shots', 'innocent', 'people', 'order', 'get', 'loved', 'ones', 'cooperate', 'action', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'simply', ""n't"", 'fit', 'character', ""'re"", 'out', 'push', 'buttons', 'here', 'not', 'build', 'believable', 'storyline', 'recommend', 'Taken', 'fun', 'mindless', 'action', 'movie', 'pass', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'waste', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'trying', 'find', 'sense', 'spectacle', 'movie', 'not', 'philosophical', 'one.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Taken

The many issues raised by this provocative film are:1. Will a gang of eastern European thugs and white slaving kidnappers, living in Paris, accept a middle aged, former American CIA agent with a thick Irish accent as a Paris policeman, just because he shows them a French Police ID that he stole with a French name on it?2. Can an American just arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris involve himself in a violent manic foot chase and wild fight with another man all over the arrival area of the airport, resulting in the death of the man being chased, and then suddenly appear in central Paris without much interest from the French police?3. Can the distance between two nearly adjacent bridges in Paris be stretched enough to allow for a lengthy car chase that is really unnecessary because the hero could have walked to the next bridge in less time than the car chase takes?4. Can an American, former CIA agent, with a thick Irish accent, pretending to be a Paris policeman, leap from the Pont des Artes onto a passing yacht and NOT have the yacht be filled with evil, Arab mobsters?5. Can a movie involving a good but hard to get along with American former CIA agent, with a thick Irish accent, with a gorgeous ex-wife who has left him for a rich guy, possibly get to the end of the movie without the ex-wife admitting that her rejected former husband is a worthy man, a good man, a man she should have treated better and appreciated more?6. Can the daughter of an American former CIA agent be kidnapped in Paris and turned into a drugged out, white slave whore for Arab mobsters and forced into prostitution, then saved by Dad in a bloodbath on the Seine, quickly get back to life as usual when Dad drops her off at the now appreciative ex-wife's house in Beverly Hills; will Mom & the American, former CIA agent with a thick Irish accent, reconcile?These issue are profound, and frankly the answers are hard to come by from the film itself.

1194234,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B001GCUNYO,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 3]","Face it, fellow dads, we don't really have any movie to watch on Father's Day. There are tons for Christmas, Thanksgiving, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day and even Guy Fawkes Day got V For Vendetta. Who would've guessed that Liam Neeson of all people, would bring us seemingly the only Father's Day movie, and make it a great one as well? Ok fine, the movie doesn't quite have anything to do with the holiday, but this is such a movie for dads that it might as well be, and will definitely be one I start watching yearly every June. I'd also like to state that this totally clears Liam's name from The Phantom Menace as well.Bryan Mills is a former Special-Ops agent, who describes his former title as a 'preventer' when he was overseas. He now lives in Los Angeles to try and reconnect with his daughter Kim, who lives with her mom and her new husband who's pretty much rolling in money. Bryan is very protective of Kim, and wants what's best for her, and even tries to get a pop singer he bodyguards one night to help Kim out since she wants to be a famous singer. But one day, against her dad's wishes, Kim takes a trip to Europe with her not-so-smart friend Amanda, and things go wrong almost immediately. When they make it to their hotel, their room is broken into by strange men who take Amanda, while Kim sees the whole thing from her window in another room, while at the same time talking to Bryan on her phone. Terrified, she tells him what's going on, and he tells her that she's going to be taken, and to list as much info about the captors as she can before they nab her. One of the men picks up the phone while Bryan's listening, and Bryan gives them a bone-chilling warning that he's coming for them, and that he -will- kill them if they don't let her go immediately. The man simply answers with 'good luck' and hangs up. With his connections from his old job, Bryan takes after them right away, and won't stop at anything or anyone that gets in his way, regardless if they've helped him in the past.Normally, I get bored with the 'one man army' kind of action movie, but not here. Taken is so well done that the movie never drags on, and even when it seems like it's going to get to a boring moment, something new happens, and we're at a new scene. The pacing is so perfect, and the first time I watched it, I couldn't believe the movie was over because it went by so fast and smoothly. Liam does a fantastic job as Bryan, an effective force of a man who realistically and brutally dispatches of his enemies. A lot of the moves Liam does in the movie are very practical moves from martial arts like Wing Chun, and nothing ever gets fancy. When a move works and takes out the opponent, it's over for them, and he doesn't keep going to the point of overkill. It was nice. I was emotionally attached to his character, and wanted him to bust the bad guys in the worst way possible for taking Kim, and even more after seeing what was being planned for her. What makes the movie work is that Bryan isn't a monster who can't be stopped. Sure, he plows through enemies, but he's not brainless- he is very much human, and the audience can relate to him, and might even let his actions slide because of the circumstances. Compare Liam, who's nearly 60, to a slightly older actor like Sylvester Stallone and usually plays the same character in his action movies, and you'll see a clear difference between the two, and how it's easier to like one more than the other, and how Taken isn't exactly like the other shoot/beat 'em ups out there.Unfortunately, the blu-ray doesn't look that great, and that's a big surprise considering how much of a surprise hit the movie was. Some colors are too faded while others are over saturated, some deep black look a bit green, and there's even some grain in a couple of scenes. It's a shame because this movie could've looked great on the right set up. The audio's much better at least, a Dolby 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, and Spanish and French tracks in Dolby Digital 5.1. Everything sounds strong and nearly perfect here. I actually re-watched a few chapters when I first got the blu-ray, before letting the movie finish, because they sounded so good.The special features are robust, but a mixed bag, starting with the international edition cut of the movie, which has a bit more violence than the regular version. You'll probably just end up watching this one and ignore the regular cut. There's a commentary track in French with the director and cinematographers that only the biggest fans of the movie should check out since reading a commentary track is never that fun. It's definitely informative, but there's another commentary track with co-writer Robert Mark Kamen that's just as good. Le Making Of is your typical set of interviews with the cast/crew, going on about how great it is to be working on the movie. There's also a little bit of footage from the premier of Taken, though it's more on the promotional side. Black Ops Field Manual is a useless extra that shows where the characters are as the movie progresses, and finally are trailers and a story board comparison. Basically, nothing too exciting for casual fans of the movie, and the only thing worth checking out if you have time is the commentary with Robert.What more is there to say?

Clueless mother lets her daughter go on a trip to Europe with only another girl who just supposedly turned 18. They get kidnapped by an Albanian ring who specialize in white slavery, etc. Liam Neeson, the father, is an ex some kind of special op's for the government. In other words, he knows how to take care of business. He goes over to Paris and proceeds to become a one man Albanian butt kicking crew. I believe he kills or maims half the Albanians in Paris before he gets his daughter back! If you have ever seen Mystery Science Theater, with the robot making fun of the proceedings , then that was I watching this flick. Neeson does a great acting job keeping a straight face throughout. Lots of silly action and over the top fighting and graphic violence. Give it a 2 for the amusement factor.The glowing reviews for this film makes me believe that the criteria for the action genre has sunk to a new low. The plot is so obvious that a 7 year old can follow it. It is simplistic, banal, and utterly predictable. The film takes itself too seriously, and has little relation to the actual kidnapping problem in Europe. The film would have been more palatable if done tongue in cheek. Where is the nuance? The bad guys take incompetence to a new level, while the good guy performs at superhero level. I think that these types of movies appeal to the reptilian brain in all of us.

The plot of the story has already been discussed, so suffice to say that it isn't at all a realistic movie. It isn't really believable that a man in his fifties will outfight dozens and dozens of armed, young men, no matter how well trained he is. Especially considering that at many points in the movie, the bad guys have clear shots at him, yet inexplicably miss.There are logic gaps everywhere. For example, in the scene where Neeson visits the home of his friend the chief inspector of French Police (or whoever he is), the friend sneaks a gun to the dinner table and tries to kill Neeson, who had earlier emptied the gun of its bullets. What was to prevent the man from checking his gun to see if it had any bullets in it, before coming to the table?Silly risk. Anyway...If the movie were done with a tongue-in-cheek, self aware attitude it might be more fun. The insertion of techno music during action sequences (the sort of action sequence where Neeson looses five or six rounds and kills five or six men, and those same men miss Neeson with one million sub-machinegun bullets) seems to indicate that this is that sort of picture.However, the movie seems to take itself too seriously. How come Neeson kills five billion (maybe fewer, whatever) people but doesn't have to face any cops for what he did?Was his daughter emotionally scarred at all from all of this? She seemed pretty okay at the end of the film, even though it all happened recently (her dad's arm was still in a cast). Then it's implied she will become a professional pop star. I guess as a reward for being spoiled her whole life and ignoring her father's warnings.I wonder if she cared that her ""best friend"" died horribly of a drug overdose while being abused by thugs.But never mind, she will be a pro singer.Hey, why did Neeson shoot the French guy's wife? Oh yes, to prove he meant business! He really wanted his daughter back!""Hey, I'll murder your wife, your kids, and then you, mister. My kid's life is the only thing that's important!""Lots of random, innocent slobs get killed, too. Like some party security guy watching an elevator, or a guy carrying champagne. Probably just earning a salary and waiting for the clock to indicate it's time to go home to their apartment and maybe play a DVD and relax.But NO! They got in Neeson's way, so NECK-SNAP!That's the trouble with this movie. We're supposed to believe that Neeson is the good guy, but he's selfish. He kills people who may not even be evil, just to accomplish his goal.But at least he did accomplish his goal. Hey, he DID call the police about all those girls he found, being used as prostitute slaves, didn't he? He DID, right?No? Well how about his daughter's dead friend's cousins? What did they think about their relative dying horribly?Who cares!

1194248,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001GCUNYO,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Remember last year when you seen NOTHING but previews for this film?  I remember this VERY well.  The hype this movie received was almost too much to take!  It got to the point where the hype alone was turning me off.Well it's been a year later, and I watched Taken tonight for the very first time trying to forget about those annoyingly repetitive commercials.I started out VERY disappointed.  I have to be honest about that.  The very beginning of the movie shows the single father having memories of his daughter's birthday party from when she was just a little girl.  We've seen the same thing a MILLION times in other movies.  I was preparing myself for a very overrated and predictable film.  Some of the scenes even had a low budget feel to them.The next 20 minutes didn't win me over either.  The father goes to his daughter's birthday party (he wasn't dreaming about it this time) to bring her a gift.Then the fathers ex-wife enters the picture.  The two of them start talking and obviously they don't get along (filled with sarcastic little shots in between of course!)Of course, her new husband enters the picture as well, pretends to be friends with the daughter's father, but you know very well they could never be friends because they talk in a way where it's plainly obvious they don't care about each other in the slightest, and then the father leaves the birthday party and returns home.That's the first 20 minutes of film- horribly predictable story-telling we must have seen a million times.  So it's VERY important to keep watching past those 20 minutes.When the actual story kicks in concerning the daughter having to get her fathers approval to take a vacation to France (by way of a signature signing taking place in a restaurant) *this* is when the plot development really gets interesting.The father is reluctant to send his daughter to a foreign country for safety reasons, but eventually he gives in.  Otherwise he'd been considered a horrible father.When the daughter arrives to France with her one friend, you see them having fun and dancing around in a hotel room.  The daughter walks into another room, and through a window she sees her friend being attacked and kidnapped by three or four strange men that walked into the room.  She panics, so she hides under a bed.This is where you have to take into consideration the storyline is fictional, because the daughter calls up the father while hiding under a bed, and tells him what's going on with her friend.The father then calmly and precisely gives his daughter instructions on how to handle the situation.I was like ""Are you SERIOUS!""  Most fathers would become emotional, confused and worried if such a situation were to present itself.  Apparently this father thought he was some kind of superman who not only knew how to tell a darn good well-prepared speech, but also had an ability to remain completely calm over the phone WHILE the daughter was being taken away by the bad guys!How is this possible?

family with flashback scenes from the first filmand this time Bryan and his wife get Taken by the Albanians in Istanbulwhile Maggie Grace tries to rescue her mom and dadi couldn't see the point really on this sequel but just as much action as the first filmBut still Liam neeson steals the film, aswell as Famke jansen and Maggie graceGreat performances No Doubtso if you watch TAKEN, then you better

The latest addition to the category, ""Taken"", treads on familiar ground, but succeeds in breathing fresh life into the concept through the unusual casting of Liam Neeson as a retired special ops agent; eschewing glamor for gritty determination, Neeson is so good that the film becomes a homage to not only the genre, but to a father's devotion to his child in an increasingly dangerous world.Neeson is clearly a dinosaur, not only among the flashy, media-savvy operatives of the intelligence community, but as a parent, as well; his over-protectiveness of his daughter is scoffed at by his ex-wife (Famke Janssen), and his ongoing surveillance has a nearly creepy quality. Yet when his instructions are ignored, and his daughter is abducted by a white slavery ring in France, Neeson quickly proves himself to be their worst nightmare, a relentless, unforgiving adversary.While a legitimate argument can be made that the story's resolution is too 'sugar-coated' and pat, it does provide an optimism that is too often lacking in recent films, and I enjoyed it...""Taken"" is a terrific suspense film, and certainly worth owning, especially if you're a Liam Neeson fan!",5,Flashy Homage to Genre with Powerhouse Neeson Performance...,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,1446,"['premise', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'rescued', 'incredibly', 'skilled', 'father', 'become', 'something', 'film', 'genre', 'past', 'three', 'decades', 'parent', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'action', 'movie', 'icon', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'example', 'latest', 'addition', 'category', 'Taken', 'familiar', 'ground', 'breathing', 'fresh', 'life', 'concept', 'unusual', 'casting', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'retired', 'special', 'ops', 'agent', 'eschewing', 'glamor', 'gritty', 'determination', 'Neeson', 'so', 'good', 'film', 'homage', 'not', 'only', 'genre', 'father', 'devotion', 'child', 'increasingly', 'dangerous', 'world.Neeson', 'clearly', 'dinosaur', 'not', 'only', 'flashy', 'media-savvy', 'operatives', 'intelligence', 'community', 'parent', 'well', 'over-protectiveness', 'daughter', 'scoffed', 'ex-wife', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'ongoing', 'surveillance', 'nearly', 'creepy', 'quality', 'when', 'instructions', 'are', 'ignored', 'daughter', 'abducted', 'white', 'slavery', 'ring', 'France', 'Neeson', 'quickly', 'be', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'relentless', 'unforgiving', 'legitimate', 'argument', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'story', 'resolution', 'too', ""'sugar-coated"", 'pat', 'provide', 'optimism', 'too', 'often', 'lacking', 'recent', 'films', 'enjoyed', 'Taken', 'terrific', 'suspense', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'owning', 'especially', ""'re"", 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'fan']",Taken

Like Tchaikovsky's music for Swan Lake, this film begins very quietly and continues to smoothly, evenly ramp up a cresendo to absolute ferosity. The energy and suspense of the ending might even leave you breathless. Opening on a child's birthday party, this film opens slowly, delibertly building back story. You get to know Bryan (Neeson), his history as a spy, how he has been affected by the disolusion of his marriage and his estrangement from his daughter. You meet some of the people with whom he used to work and the frienships he's maintained. When his daughter wants to go to a trip to Paris with a friend you understand his reaction - and why he gives in. Everything is nailed down in the first act. No loose ends are left for later. The avantage of this unusual but obviously deliberate approach is that, as the cresendo continues and the action begins, there is nothing in the way. It's a straight line from what's this about to Whoa! I can breathe again. This would be a great action thriller by any measure.

Though the subject matter is rough (trafficking of young naive women); the action and plot is riveting.Liam Neesom plays a newly retired and lonely agent; he gave up his career because he loved his daughter more.  He was very good at his job but appears to be vulnerable now and weak because he is without career, family, and everything he once held dear.  His wife has moved on to greener pastures and he is left trying to pick up the crumbs of his former existence.  His friends still hold him in high regard and try to get him to give life and his talents another shot.When his daughter and his former wife lie to him about an upcoming European jaunt, the situation goes from bad to worse and Liam has to leap in and save the day.  While attempting to save his daughter and balance the scorecard; he seems to rediscover himself and his daughter along the way.  Despite some of the subject matter (which I do not believe is appropriate for the younger audience) the plot and the action is fast paced, real and powerful.Liam Neesom's character is named Bryan Mills, his daughter Kimmie is played by Maggie Grace who I think does a very good job in the role (although some other reviewers have disagreed).  Taken was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and directed by Pierre Morel. Luc Besson who is known for his action films Transporter trilogy and The Professional comes through in spades with Taken.  You may have a difficult time judging whether Bryan Mills is good or bad; what you discover is that in his job he has become a bit of both.  I think he could have played James Bond with aplomb.  After seeing this film,  I am convinced that he would have been a match for that role.I have to say that the sex trade is usually not my type of film; but this movie reeled me in and I found it exciting, well acted and unfortunately very believable; it is funny how many of us discoonect from the sordidness that is a reality out there in our everyday existence and just live in our cocoon day in and day out.A real eye opener.Highly recommended: A-Bentley/2009",4,The Craftsman,1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,2154,"['Liam', 'Neeson', 'never', 'made', 'bad', 'movie', 'estimation', 'phenomenal', 'actor', 'subject', 'matter', 'rough', 'trafficking', 'young', 'naive', 'women', 'action', 'plot', 'riveting.Liam', 'Neesom', 'newly', 'retired', 'lonely', 'agent', 'gave', 'up', 'career', 'loved', 'daughter', 'more', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'now', 'weak', 'career', 'family', 'everything', 'once', 'held', 'dear', 'wife', 'moved', 'greener', 'pastures', 'left', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'crumbs', 'former', 'existence', 'friends', 'still', 'hold', 'high', 'regard', 'try', 'get', 'give', 'life', 'talents', 'shot.When', 'daughter', 'former', 'wife', 'lie', 'upcoming', 'European', 'jaunt', 'situation', 'bad', 'worse', 'Liam', 'leap', 'save', 'day', 'attempting', 'save', 'daughter', 'balance', 'scorecard', 'rediscover', 'daughter', 'way', 'subject', 'matter', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'audience', 'plot', 'action', 'fast', 'paced', 'real', 'powerful.Liam', 'Neesom', 'character', 'named', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'daughter', 'Kimmie', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'who', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'disagreed', 'Taken', 'was', 'written', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'Robert', 'Mark', 'Kamen', 'directed', 'Pierre', 'Morel', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'who', 'known', 'action', 'films', 'Transporter', 'trilogy', 'Professional', 'spades', 'Taken', 'may', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'judging', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'good', 'bad', 'what', 'discover', 'job', 'become', 'bit', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'James', 'Bond', 'aplomb', 'seeing', 'film', 'am', 'convinced', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'match', 'role.I', 'have', 'say', 'sex', 'trade', 'usually', 'not', 'type', 'film', 'movie', 'reeled', 'found', 'exciting', 'well', 'acted', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'believable', 'funny', 'how', 'many', 'discoonect', 'sordidness', 'reality', 'there', 'everyday', 'existence', 'just', 'live', 'cocoon', 'day', 'day', 'out.A', 'real', 'eye', 'opener.Highly', 'recommended', 'A-Bentley/2009']",Taken

Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, a retired government employee who has moved to California to be closer to his daughter Kim, played by Lost's Maggie Grace. Bryan is hesitant when Kim says she is going on a trip to Europe with her friends, but agrees to let her go if she promises to call. Kim does call from Paris, and while she does, Kim witnesses her friend Amanda being kidnapped. Suddenly, Bryan isn't retired anymore. He goes into ""government employee mode"" and tells Kim that she is going to be kidnapped and that he will come and save her.While working for the government, Bryan was a ""preventer."" He prevented bad things from happening. You get a picture of what those skills were when he begans encountering and dispatching with thugs easily in France. The action is fast paced and brutal, but not overly gory since this is a PG-13 movie.Bryan's CIA friends tell him he only has 96 hours to save his daughter. Neeson effortly displays the passion and desperation of a father about to lose his daughter. The villians are solid, and Maggie Grace is good as Kim.I enjoyed this movie and believe it did so well at the theaters because it is about a father saving his daughter. It is about good versus evil. There is no gray area, if you are bad, you are killed by Bryan Mills, angry father and killing machine. There's no message in the film about the environment or terrorism or anything else that many big movies try to slip in to appease the critics.

His daughter travels to France with a friend and is abducted by white slave traders shortly after she arrives there.  Just as she is being abducted she is speaking to Liam Neeson on the phone.

Now, to me, rather than going it alone to Paris given he has only 96 hours to save his daughter from a life of white slavery, he only enlists one guy to do some research on the criminals who may be involved with the kidnapping of his daughter. You don't think these guys would take 96 hours out of their lives to help their buddy, if asked?I just didn't get that. Why introduce these guys as his friends and have them bond at a backyard barbecue then on a job working security, then say bye bye. Did they not have enough in the budget to pay them all to fly to Paris?Anyway, there are some cringe-inducing drugged out scenes of horror as young girls are forced into prostitution so fair warning those who don't dig needles, disgusting room conditions and the whole world of human trafficking.

The stunt work and car chases rank with Bourne or better.I won't go into descriptive plot details, except to say -- nothing could be more primal to the gut than to have your own daughter kidnapped. On this premise, ex-spy-operative Bryan Mills (Neeson) is now granted a  license to leave a trail of dead bodies in his wake as he conducts a vengeful search for his kidnapped 17 year old daughter in the most corrupt dens of Paris.Mill's rampage seems justified, and throughout this amped-up movie I found myself screaming ""DO IT!"" as he slaughtered one bad guy after another. The unrelenting drive and ingenuity of Mills as he races against time is what makes this movie so interesting.Still, while my lower brain gleefully submits to the revenge killing, my conscience is disturbed. This film also happens to be perfect to show to future troops the US Government would send into the Middle East or Eastern Europe, with the troubling, simplistic message ""Keep our children safe.""""Taken"" implicitly concludes that torture and murder are OK (in fact, ultra-cool) in the commission of a rescue; in other words, the end justifies the means -- Which seems to be the intrinsic, inescapable, primal message of Taken. And there is a strong thread of xenophobia against brown-skinned people that for me sends up a red caution flag.It's evil subplot of a criminal culture that is auctioning young girls for prostitution is also reminiscent of the earlier 1970's film, ""Prime Cut.""A very enjoyable thriller, but with no-so-nice political and racial overtones.",4,Superb but xenophobic thriller,1288915200,"11 5, 2010",2010,1850,"['Taken', 'surprised', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'good', 'Taken', 'harsh', 'intense', 'prejudicial', 'not-so-subtle', 'punch.If', 'Star', 'Wars', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'qualification', 'enough', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'now', 'stepped', 'ranks', 'finest', 'action', 'heroes', 'superb', 'role', 'stunt', 'work', 'car', 'chases', 'rank', 'Bourne', 'better.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'descriptive', 'plot', 'details', 'say', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'primal', 'gut', 'have', 'own', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'premise', 'ex-spy-operative', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'Neeson', 'now', 'granted', 'license', 'leave', 'trail', 'dead', 'bodies', 'wake', 'vengeful', 'search', 'kidnapped', '17', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'most', 'corrupt', 'dens', 'Paris.Mill', 'rampage', 'justified', 'amped-up', 'movie', 'found', 'screaming', 'DO', 'IT', 'slaughtered', 'one', 'bad', 'guy', 'unrelenting', 'drive', 'ingenuity', 'Mills', 'time', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'interesting.Still', 'lower', 'brain', 'gleefully', 'revenge', 'killing', 'conscience', 'disturbed', 'film', 'also', 'be', 'perfect', 'show', 'future', 'troops', 'US', 'Government', 'would', 'send', 'Middle', 'East', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'troubling', 'simplistic', 'message', 'Keep', 'children', 'safe', 'Taken', 'implicitly', 'torture', 'murder', 'are', 'OK', 'fact', 'ultra-cool', 'commission', 'rescue', 'other', 'words', 'end', 'means', 'be', 'intrinsic', 'inescapable', 'primal', 'message', 'Taken', 'strong', 'thread', 'xenophobia', 'brown-skinned', 'people', 'up', 'red', 'caution', 'flag.It', 'evil', 'subplot', 'criminal', 'culture', 'auctioning', 'young', 'girls', 'prostitution', 'also', 'reminiscent', 'earlier', '1970', 'film', 'Prime', 'Cut', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'thriller', 'no-so-nice', 'political', 'racial', 'overtones']",Taken

It's a full blown action movie that challenges the 56 year old and his acting ability to appear cool. The film has its drawbacks, but they are all massively outweighed by the better parts of the film.The film focuses around retired spy Bryan Mills (Neeson) whos daughter is kidnapped whilst on a trip to Paris with her close friend. He's a man who wasn't there for a lot of his daughters life due to his job, but is trying to make up for lost time with overprotective, suffocating fathering. Kim (Maggie Grace) and her friend are kidnapped by Albanian human traffickers whilst Bryan is on the phone to Kim. He tells her not to be scared and he will find her, he also tells the Albanian kidnapper who taunts Bryan on the phone. This leads into a series of events where Bryan is investigating the human traffickers in France using vigilante methods, but this is at the displeasure of the French authorities and an old friend of Bryans who simply want him out of France. He promises his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janseen, who quite frankly creeps me out) that he will return her safe and sound, at any cost but the only drawback is he has 96 hours.This is a really good and fast paced action movies that has some excellent chase and combat scenes. Neeson seems to hold his own well and can display some excellent ability when it comes to those action scenes (although I'm sure a stunt double was cleverly placed in those scenes). Some of the dialogue is quite cringe worthy especially when Neesons character is on the phone to the kidnapper and he tells him that he has experience and he will be coming for them. It's something very clich&eacute; and annoying in some respects but quite cool in another. The other gripe I had about it was the accent of Neeson. I'm not sure where his character was meant to hail from but it certainly wasn't American born and bred, or at least I hope not. Neeson's a good actor but he really needs to work on his American accent because it just destroys any role he's in when he's meant to be an American but his Irish accent clearly shines through.It's a great film overall though and I would strongly recommend it to any action movie fan. He's good in this role, but I can't see him doing another role like this ever again as although he held his own, he seemed at times to be quite uncomfortable in what he was doing. The supporting cast are OK but nothing to shout about, the story is well done and seems to be quite intelligent in what it's talking about when on the subject of human trafficking. But what do I know, maybe this is the most inconsistent movie I've ever seen. If it is then it certainly hid it well. I just have one request to any future movie makers, please don't cast Famke Janseen, she's just weird.",5,Really Good Movie,1227398400,"11 23, 2008",2008,2889,"['Liam', 'Neeson', 'one', 'actors', 'will', 'admire', 'work', 'Taken', 'movie', 'could', 'never', 'expect', 'be', 'lead', 'full', 'blown', 'action', 'movie', '56', 'year', 'old', 'acting', 'ability', 'appear', 'cool', 'film', 'drawbacks', 'are', 'massively', 'outweighed', 'better', 'parts', 'film.The', 'film', 'around', 'retired', 'spy', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'Neeson', 'whos', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'whilst', 'trip', 'Paris', 'close', 'friend', 'man', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'lot', 'daughters', 'life', 'due', 'job', 'trying', 'make', 'up', 'lost', 'time', 'overprotective', 'suffocating', 'fathering', 'Kim', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'friend', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'Albanian', 'human', 'traffickers', 'whilst', 'Bryan', 'phone', 'Kim', 'not', 'be', 'scared', 'will', 'find', 'also', 'Albanian', 'kidnapper', 'who', 'Bryan', 'phone', 'series', 'events', 'where', 'Bryan', 'investigating', 'human', 'traffickers', 'France', 'using', 'vigilante', 'methods', 'displeasure', 'French', 'authorities', 'old', 'friend', 'Bryans', 'who', 'simply', 'want', 'France', 'ex-wife', 'Lenore', 'Famke', 'Janseen', 'who', 'quite', 'frankly', 'creeps', 'out', 'will', 'return', 'safe', 'sound', 'cost', 'only', 'drawback', '96', 'hours.This', 'really', 'good', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'movies', 'excellent', 'chase', 'combat', 'scenes', 'Neeson', 'hold', 'own', 'well', 'can', 'display', 'excellent', 'ability', 'when', 'action', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'stunt', 'double', 'was', 'cleverly', 'placed', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'quite', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'especially', 'when', 'Neesons', 'character', 'phone', 'kidnapper', 'experience', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'something', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'annoying', 'respects', 'quite', 'cool', 'other', 'gripe', 'had', 'was', 'accent', 'Neeson', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'character', 'was', 'meant', 'hail', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'American', 'born', 'bred', 'least', 'hope', 'not', 'Neeson', 'good', 'actor', 'really', 'work', 'American', 'accent', 'just', 'role', 'when', 'meant', 'be', 'American', 'Irish', 'accent', 'clearly', 'through.It', 'great', 'film', 'overall', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'action', 'movie', 'fan', 'good', 'role', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'doing', 'role', 'ever', 'again', 'held', 'own', 'seemed', 'times', 'be', 'quite', 'uncomfortable', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'OK', 'nothing', 'shout', 'about', 'story', 'well', 'done', 'be', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'what', 'talking', 'when', 'subject', 'human', 'trafficking', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'maybe', 'most', 'inconsistent', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'then', 'certainly', 'well', 'just', 'have', 'one', 'request', 'future', 'movie', 'makers', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'cast', 'Famke', 'Janseen', 'just', 'weird']",Taken

So, here is a taut and swift-moving thriller, with a seemingly indestructible hero/family man, single-mindedly boring through Paris like a runaway oil-rig drill, utilizing old contacts, old friends, mad spy skilz and no little willingness to pour on the specialized brutality - in search of his kidnapped daughter. And quell horror, she's been kidnapped by some middle-European baddies involved in what used to be called a white slave ring, which is what they used to call low-life traffickers in women for sex ... a plot that is probably as almost as old as the oldest profession. And Liam Neeson does very well, as the retired black-ops veteran, hoping to reconnect with his teen-aged daughter, even if his ex-wife has married a fabulously wealthy man who can offer the girl everything except rescue, when she and her best friend fly off to Paris for a bit of un-chaperoned adventure.

Taken is marvelous at this because its premise is not only something that makes for a great action thriller, but is also a huge problem in the world today, often overlooked by many: human trafficking.Liam Neeson gives a balls-to-the wall performance as ex CIA operative Mills. Neeson may not look like an angry stud like Willis, Schwarzenegger or Stallone; but trust me, after seeing him here, he's more than convincing. I enjoyed seeing him play a ruthless villain in Batman Begins, and he takes that same dark edge and brings it to our hero in Taken.Mills has lived a vey fast paced life and seen action in numerous global conflicts to include Afghanistan. All that is behind him now though, as he has made plans to mend his tattered relationship with his teenage daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Between the hurt feelings of several missed birthdays and Christmases due to the excessive travel of his job, and Kim's mother's new insanely rich live-in boyfriend; Mills has his work cut out for him.At 91 minutes, Taken is a very short film, especially for its genre. But it never seems short and it gives us everything we need early on, to care for its characters and the events that happen to them. The relationship between Mills and his daughter is crucial to the story and had it not been believable, the film would have suffered. It is believable. He cares for her more than anything in the world and wants nothing but for her to be happy.So naturally, when his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and Kim need his permission for Kim to leave the country, to follow U2 to France with a friend, Mills wants to oblige them. It's painstakingly hard for him at first, as he is more than aware of the dangers that face a young girl traveling without adult supervision in Europe; but we already know from the film's title that he will let her go.Mills is super-smart however and exceptionally well prepared. He buys her a universal cell phone, and only agrees to let her go if she will in turn agree to calling and checking in with him at his approved times.On the first day in France, Kim witnesses from across the hall, her friend being kidnapped. The film's pivotal moment is a phone call between Kim and her father as she explains to him what is happening.When I first saw the trailer, I thought Mills was in on it, by his freakishly calm comment to his daughter, ""They're going to take you."" But the only reason he is so calm is because he realizes he only has a few precious seconds to tell Kim what to do, before these heinous men take her. He tells her to hide under the bed and to shout out every detail that she can about her captors, and that he will come for her. The suspense builds from there as one of them actually picks up the phone, and Mills delivers some of the best one-liners in any action film of recent years. The scumbag's response? ""Good luck.""Having obviously recorded this conversation with hi-tech spy equipment, Mills uses sources in Langley to assist in narrowing down the list of suspects. A nice little game of `I told you so', and an immediate plane ticket to France from his ex-wife and her rich boyfriend, and he's off.Taken could have easily been over the top and unrealistic but Neeson plays Mills so genuinely, that we never doubt he'd be capable of pulling any of these things off. Yeah, there are a few one guy takes on several guys action sequences, but they are executed well and initiated with Mills' brains, rather than bronze. His wits and extensive training allow him to infiltrate these European trafficking layers with great ease.I have no idea how they pulled off a PG - 13 rating, but they did! The action is intense and in your face and the suspense could shatter bones. Mills has no mercy in this film and we love him for it. Watch for the scene that takes place at a dinner table, while Mills visits an old friend. You will never see what he does coming; you'll know the one I mean.I really enjoyed the actors they cast to play the villains in the film as well; you really want to see them suffer for what they've done to these young women. In case you are unfamiliar with the term human trafficking, let me simplify it for you. They kidnap young women, drug them, and sell them to rich men to use as sex slaves. Many of them as is the case with Kim are minors and virgins, and they go for the most cash. Make no mistake, this may be a big Hollywood movie, but this goes on every day in our world.I've read some skeptical reviews on the film from writers who seriously doubt that this world exits to the extent that the film portrays. I'm more than convinced that it's not far off. I've seen some truly evil people in my life and I've seen how money can corrupt people too. Give evil men money and power and what do you think they'll do with it? No-one can deny that these women go missing, so where are they going then?",5,Taken Review,1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,5272,"['TAKENSTARRING', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'Famke',

1194318,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B001GCUNYO,Cubist,"[2, 2]","When Taken was finally released in North America, after already playing in Europe for a year, it became a surprise hit. Not bad for what is essentially a B-movie revenge story starring an A-list actor. The film was produced by French filmmaker Luc Besson, who's responsible for action classics likeLa Femme Nikita (Special Edition)andLeon - The Professional (Deluxe Edition). He also produced and co-wrote the popular Transporter films so he certainly knows what audiences around the world want to see.The film delivers exactly what it promises: an excellent and entertaining thrill ride with no frills. It is as single-minded as its protagonist's mission and plugs in exciting car chases, fight scenes and gun battles. And yet, you are still emotionally invested in Neeson's character - you care about what happens to him and his daughter. The result is a truly satisfying and engaging film.You have the option of watching the theatrical version or the unrated cut.There is an audio commentary by director Pierre Morel and cinematographers Michel Abramowicz and Michel Julienne. They decided on two distinctive looks for the film: sunny and vibrant colours for Los Angeles and a darker vibe for Paris. They talk about the differences between American and French film crews. They also praise Liam Neeson's ability to play a loving father and a deadly killing machine. They also talks about the challenges of working in a city like Paris.Also included is a commentary by co-screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen. He mentioned that he's been writing for 30 years with 15 of them with Luc Besson. They met onThe Fifth Element (Ultimate Edition). He worked with the filmmaker on creating a production company in Europe writing ""low-impact action movies."" Kamen says that the premise of the film was based on a story Besson heard from a French cop. Kamen also talks about how he writes with Besson and praises his ""cinematic vision.""""Le Making Of"" is fairly standard if not engaging press kit material with the main cast talking about their characters and the story with clips from the film. There is plenty of behind-the-scenes footage of some of the film's exciting action sequences being shot.""Avant Premiere"" features footage of the film's world premiere in France with Neeson, Morel and Besson doing interviews on the red carpet. There is haunting footage of Neeson and his late wife Natasha Richardson who was also in attendance.Finally, there is ""Inside Action: Side by Side Comparisons,"" which takes a look at six action sequences being filmed along with the finished product.",5,Another No-Nonsense Action film from Luc Besson,1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,2572,"['When', 'Taken', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'North', 'America', 'already', 'playing', 'Europe', 'year', 'became', 'surprise', 'hit', 'Not', 'bad', 'what', 'essentially', 'B-movie', 'revenge', 'story', 'starring', 'A-list', 'actor', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'French', 'filmmaker', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'who', 'responsible', 'action', 'classics', 'likeLa', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Professional', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'also', 'produced', 'co-wrote', 'popular', 'Transporter', 'films', 'so', 'certainly', 'what', 'around', 'world', 'want', 'see.The', 'film', 'delivers', 'exactly', 'what', 'excellent', 'entertaining', 'thrill', 'ride', 'frills', 'as', 'single-minded', 'protagonist', 'mission', 'plugs', 'exciting', 'car', 'chases', 'fight', 'scenes', 'gun', 'battles', 'yet', 'are', 'still', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'Neeson', 'character', 'care', 'what', 'daughter', 'result', 'truly', 'satisfying', 'engaging', 'film.You', 'have', 'option', 'watching', 'theatrical', 'version', 'unrated', 'cut.There', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Pierre', 'Morel', 'cinematographers', 'Michel', 'Abramowicz', 'Michel', 'Julienne', 'decided', 'two', 'distinctive', 'looks', 'film', 'sunny', 'vibrant', 'colours', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'darker', 'vibe', 'Paris', 'talk', 'differences', 'American', 'French', 'film', 'crews', 'also', 'praise', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'ability', 'play', 'loving', 'father', 'deadly', 'killing', 'machine', 'also', 'talks', 'challenges', 'working', 'city', 'Paris.Also', 'included', 'commentary', 'co-screenwriter', 'Robert', 'Mark', 'Kamen', 'mentioned', 'been', 'writing', '30', 'years', '15', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'met', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', 'worked', 'filmmaker', 'creating', 'production', 'company', 'Europe', 'writing', 'low-impact', 'action', 'movies', 'Kamen', 'premise', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'story', 'Besson', 'heard', 'French', 'cop', 'Kamen', 'also', 'how', 'Besson', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'Le', 'Making', 'fairly', 'standard', 'not', 'engaging', 'press', 'kit', 'material', 'main', 'cast', 'talking', 'characters', 'story', 'clips', 'film', 'plenty', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'film', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'being', 'shot', 'Avant', 'Premiere', 'footage', 'film', 'world', 'premiere', 'France', 'Neeson', 'Morel', 'Besson', 'doing', 'interviews', 'red', 'carpet', 'haunting', 'footage', 'Neeson', 'late', 'wife', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'attendance.Finally', 'Inside', 'Action', 'Side', 'Side', 'Comparisons', 'look', 'six', 'action', 'sequences', 'being', 'filmed', 'finished', 'product']",Taken

It should be a dull popcorn piece of entertainment and nothing more.But it isn't.  Instead, it's an edge-of-your-seat adrenaline rush from opening to close, a barrage of bullets and kick-a** moves that leaves you reeling.  Sure, it's cliched, and sure, almost all of the stunts here are theoretically impossible, but the amazing thing is that you never really care.  Liam Neeson's quest to save his daughter from the world of sex slave trafficking is a rollicking ride, fueled by Neeson's acting chops (finally, an action hero who uses his brain as much as his fists, and not to mention some silver-tongued threats) and director Pierre Morel's sense of style.  (Let's also not forget writer/producer Luc Besson, who's brought us such contemporary action classics as ""The 5th Element"" and the genuinely awe-inspiring ""Leon, The Professional"").  TAKEN isn't necessarily an action movie with brains; it's more of an action movie where you don't care if it has brains or not.  It has gravitas (in the form of Neeson, and let's face it, that was probably one of the best and most surprising casting decisions of the past decade) and skill, and will leave you gasping for breath and cheering for a genuinely likable hero who has ""a certain set of skills"" and knows exactly how to put them to use.",4,4.5 Stars--An action gem.,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,1437,"['TAKEN', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'should', 'be', 'boring', 'predictable', 'more', 'plot', 'holes', 'slice', 'Swiss', 'cheese', 'riddled', 'machine-gun', 'fire', 'should', 'be', 'dull', 'popcorn', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'nothing', 'more.But', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'opening', 'close', 'barrage', 'bullets', 'kick-a**', 'moves', 'reeling', 'Sure', 'cliched', 'sure', 'almost', 'stunts', 'here', 'are', 'theoretically', 'impossible', 'amazing', 'thing', 'never', 'really', 'care', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'quest', 'save', 'daughter', 'world', 'sex', 'slave', 'trafficking', 'rollicking', 'ride', 'fueled', 'Neeson', 'acting', 'chops', 'finally', 'action', 'hero', 'who', 'brain', 'as', 'much', 'fists', 'not', 'mention', 'silver-tongued', 'threats', 'director', 'Pierre', 'Morel', 'sense', 'style', 'Let', 'also', 'not', 'forget', 'writer/producer', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'who', 'brought', 'such', 'contemporary', 'action', 'classics', '5th', 'Element', 'genuinely', 'awe-inspiring', 'Leon', 'Professional', 'TAKEN', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'action', 'movie', 'brains', 'more', 'action', 'movie', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'brains', 'not', 'gravitas', 'form', 'Neeson', 'let', 'face', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'surprising', 'casting', 'decisions', 'past', 'decade', 'skill', 'will', 'leave', 'gasping', 'breath', 'cheering', 'genuinely', 'likable', 'hero', 'who', 'certain', 'set', 'skills', 'exactly', 'how', 'put', 'use']",Taken

1194326,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001GCUNYO,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[2, 2]","This is one intense, action packed, one and a half hours of movie. There is something that drew me in, and made me believe almost all of the amazing things that happened. The car chases were pretty spot on (going the wrong way down Les Quais de la Seine was a bit over the top); the gun fights; and the hand to hand fighting were incredible but not over the top. Liam Neeson, Bryan, is one lean mean Albanian killing machine.Bryan, former CIA agent, is divorced from his wife and she married a very rich man. Bryan quit his CIA job to live closer to his daughter Kim. Kim convinces him to allow her to travel to Paris with her friend Amanda. Bryan wants her to stay safe and gives her a cell phone to call each day. Kim falls for a con man at the Taxi stand, and they both end up kidnapped. During the kidnapping Kim is on the cell phone with her father all the way in California. The intensity of the story really starts here, the feeling of helplesness any normal human would feel is incredible. Instead, Bryan just swings into cold action.There is a moment at the airport where the film almost lost me. The two spoiled rotten very rich girls are standing at the Taxi stand in Paris. Peter, the con man, shows up and says Taxis are so expensive, would you like to share one? Under no circumstances can I imagine either of these spoiled brats thinking of saving money. If at that point Amanda had leaned over to Kim and said, hey he's hot, let's share the cab. No that didn't happen, and it just missed ringing true. A minor point, and the film doesn't suffer too much with that problem.Technically the film is pretty well done. Luc Besson co-wrote the script. Besson is a pretty amazing director in his own right, he really understands the whole thriller, edge of your seat film. The original French version of Nikita (La Femme Nikita), is very similar to this film, (Nikita is much darker). The film is skillfully directed by Pierre Morel,The Transporter. Pacing is excellent, just enough lead up and tension to each chase scene. The sound is remarkable, I felt more explosions in my seat from the subwoofer than I have in a long time. Fortunately the rumble is not over done.Oh and now for the rating. PG-13. Well, that's generous, better be sure your 13 year old is a bit mature. There is a very intense horrible torture scene about 3/4 of the way through, you may wish to fast forward. It is no worse than anything on 24 or on many television program. Just be forwarned, a 13 year old might just be a bit taken aback by this particular scene. Early in the film, we discover that Kim has been kidnapped by Albanians looking to traffic women from the Western Europe and the US. You also get to see prostitutes in Paris. There is no nudity, but be prepared that the average 13 year old might have some questions. There's very little foul language.

It's also about three different films in one, as it starts off in the vein of paranoiac American ""Europe is a hotbed of evil and degradation"" thrillers like Roman Polanski'sFranticand Eli Roth'sHostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition), then becomes a gritty examination of sex trafficking in Paris, before entering decidedly Bondesque territory for a denouement which sees the protagonist cutting a swathe of destruction through an embassy party wearing a dinner jacket. What raises it above the level of your standard brainless action fare is Liam Neeson's turn as a character who is absolutely relentless, completely unapologetic and refreshingly lacking in political correctness in the way that he goes about tracking down and eradicating the Albanian gangster clich&eacute;s that have abducted his daughter. I actually turned to the other half towards the end and informed her that early nineties dancemeisters, 'Pop Will Eat Itself' had written the soundtrack for this film in the form of a song entitled ""Get The Girl And Kill The Bad Guy"". I loved it because it's exactly the kind of nasty, brutal, unreconstructed, fascistic, old-school revenge fantasy that Hollywood has been promising us for years, but has been too frightened too actually deliver - the awfulDeath Sentence (Unrated Edition)being the most recent catastrophic misfire which comes to mind. By its very nature, the revenge thriller is not a politically correct genre and it's a mistake to try and make it one. 'Taken' is nasty, it's violent, it's actually quite racist when you think about it, and it's also completely enjoyable.

1194332,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B001GCUNYO,Dave. K,"[0, 0]","TAKEN****  Out of 5Release Date- February 27th, 2008 (France) January 30th, 2009 (USA)Running Time- 93-MinutesRating- PG-13Screenplay- Luc Besson & Robert Mark KamenDirector- Pierre MorelStarring- Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Xander Berkeley, Oliver Rabourdin, Katie Cassidy and Famke JanssenUpon seeing the preview for Taken I was quite interested in seeing this flick I came across the abduction scene when flipping through the stations and it got me hooked and I found it quite intense and was very much looking forward to this movie. In recent years the action genre has really gone downhill. And even action flicks made outside of Hollywood feel as if they were made by Hollywood. Taken does sort of feel like that at times, but this is the type of movie Hollywood once made when the produced quality movies.Taken isn't the most original movie ever made and you've seen variations of the plot done many, many times and maybe it's just me, but Taken also sort of had a feel of the TV series 24 in tone and in some of the scenes and in the main character. As much as it is an action movie Taken is also a suspense flick and both these elements work very well.The screenplay by Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen was well written, but not without its flaws. The lead character Bryan Mills played by Liam Neeson is a former CIA agent and due to that he has connections that allow him to track down the people who abducted his daughter, but the problem I had is things come a little too easy. Bryan gets a little too much done too easy and certain aspects of the plot aren't developed enough, but despite that Besson and Kamen do a solid job. Bryan Mills is the main character and really the only character that truly matters.And Besson and Kamen do a bang up job with the character. He's well developed and is a take no prisoners kick butt character. The rest of the characters are just sort of there and not given a whole lot to do, but in no way does this hurt the movie. Luc Besson has made some movies under Hollywood, but most of his flicks are French productions, but clearly geared at American audiences, but his movies are just a whole lot of fun. They might have a Hollywood feel, but they work better than most of the junk coming out of Hollywood these days. Robert Mark Kamen best known for the first three Karate Kid movies often works with Besson and both these guys work very well together. In general you may not get a cinematic masterpiece, but you do get your money's worth and Taken is by far their best work to date as writing partners (and possibly even on their own).Director Pierre Morel does a solid job even if sort of by the books. The pacing is solid and early on it moves slowly, but steady and is interesting and none of the scenes feel like fillers. The action sequences are highly enjoyable even if they lack some originality. Quite a few times I couldn't help, but think of 24, which I suppose is more due to the script, but some of the scenes feel like something done on 24. But despite some lack of originality, Morel does an excellent job and shows some potential as a filmmaker. Taken is well made and moves at a very nice pace and always remains interesting. Even if the action scenes lack originality at times they are again highly enjoyable and there are some scenes that are highly suspenseful. Also don't let the PG-13 rating scare you off. A lot has changed in cinema and movies that would once be R-rated get awayWhat really elevates Taken is the performance by Liam Neeson; Neeson is one of the most talented actors of his generation and is one of the few actors that can pull off any role and do it great. Here as Bryan Mills he delivers one of the best if not the best performance of his career and is without a doubt one of my personal favorite performances of 2008. Anytime I write a review for an action flick I always mention how the action stars out there now really leave a lot to be desired. Gone are the Stallone's and McQueen's of the action genre. Liam Neeson though makes for the perfect action star; he has the no nonsense persona done perfectly and is also a great actor. While there are many actors who have done action flicks and gave excellent performances most of the time it isn't about the actual performance, but Neeson plays the tough guy role perfectly and also delivers one hell of a performance.Maggie Grace as Kim gives a slightly awkward performance; I haven't seen a lot of her work outside of The Fog, which was simply a put a pathetic waste of time, but I thought Maggie did well with horrible material and showed some potential. At the time this movie was made I guess she was about 23 maybe and she just didn't fit playing a 17-year old girl and actually the character comes off a lot younger than 17. It's very common for actors in their mid 20s and in some cases late 20s too play teenagers and some pull it off and some don't. Maggie Grace doesn't deliver a bad performance per se, but slightly awkward. Again she wasn't bad, but just didn't fit the age of the character and came across younger than 17, but some of that is more on the writing and directing, but again it was just awkward.Famke Janssen, Xander Berkeley and Oliver Rabourdin are solid in small, but vital roles and Katie Cassidy was good, but not given a whole lot to do. All the performances are mostly solid, but like I stated before its Liam Neeson that takes center stage here and really elevates Taken. Without Neeson, Taken would have been an enjoyable flick, but Neeson takes the material and makes far more out of it.Overall Taken is a solid movie that just slightly falls short of being brilliance, but when all is said and done the movie works on pretty much every level and again I have to state it's Neeson that really elevates the movie.The Blu-ray release is quite solid in terms of picture and sound; the action sequences sound amazing and the picture is sharp.

1194335,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B001GCUNYO,David Bower,"[0, 0]","I wouldn't advise watching this movie just before you go to bed; it is a visually disturbing movie. Yes, there is a lot of exciting action, great chases, one on foot, and plenty of the bad guys getting what they deserve. That, for me, was not disturbing. I did watch the unrated version of the movie, not the theatrical version; it may be that some of the scenes which I found most disturbing are not in the theatrical release.The disturbing part to me was the picture of young people, especially young women, taking chances that can ruin their lives. The old saying that teenagers had better do what they're going to do while they're teenagers and still know everything seems to fit this movie all too well.A number of scenes showing the depravity of the slave trade are very saddening. Young women, imprisoned as prostitutes and chattel, graphically show the dangers that can lurk in societies today.One lasting impression is that there are too many really evil people out there today. I'm afraid that too many Americans have no notion of how bad things can sometimes get; they seem to believe that bad things only happen to someone else.I may watch the theatrical release later and see which scenes were deleted. The scenes in the unrated version made a convincing case for all of the actions taken by the father as he attempted to rescue his daughter.One of a number of issues that were glossed over was the lasting psychological impact of the experience on the daughter even after her rescue; she would never be the same again and would, I suspect, require extensive counseling to have any hope of resuming a normal life. Post traumatic stress disorder would be as much a problem for her as for any soldier; it could take years for the negative effects of this experience to be overcome. In that regard, the ending was much too much Hollywood Pollyannaism.If you can set aside your reason and just take the movie for what it is, it offers a fast paced, action packed movie that won't let you go; at 91 minutes it's relatively short and is over rather quickly. With the caveats mentioned above I can recommend this as an exciting action movie.",5,Exciting But Disturbing,1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,2147,"['would', ""n't"", 'advise', 'watching', 'movie', 'just', 'go', 'bed', 'visually', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'Yes', 'lot', 'exciting', 'action', 'great', 'chases', 'one', 'foot', 'plenty', 'bad', 'guys', 'getting', 'what', 'deserve', 'was', 'not', 'disturbing', 'did', 'watch', 'unrated', 'version', 'movie', 'not', 'theatrical', 'version', 'may', 'be', 'scenes', 'found', 'most', 'disturbing', 'are', 'not', 'theatrical', 'release.The', 'disturbing', 'part', 'was', 'picture', 'young', 'people', 'especially', 'young', 'women', 'taking', 'chances', 'can', 'ruin', 'lives', 'old', 'saying', 'teenagers', 'had', 'better', 'do', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', ""'re"", 'teenagers', 'still', 'know', 'everything', 'fit', 'movie', 'too', 'well.A', 'number', 'scenes', 'showing', 'depravity', 'slave', 'trade', 'are', 'very', 'saddening', 'Young', 'women', 'imprisoned', 'prostitutes', 'chattel', 'graphically', 'show', 'dangers', 'can', 'lurk', 'societies', 'today.One', 'lasting', 'impression', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'really', 'evil', 'people', 'there', 'today', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'too', 'many', 'Americans', 'have', 'notion', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'can', 'sometimes', 'get', 'seem', 'believe', 'bad', 'things', 'only', 'happen', 'someone', 'else.I', 'may', 'watch', 'theatrical', 'release', 'later', 'see', 'scenes', 'were', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'unrated', 'version', 'made', 'convincing', 'case', 'actions', 'taken', 'father', 'attempted', 'rescue', 'daughter.One', 'number', 'issues', 'were', 'glossed', 'was', 'lasting', 'psychological', 'impact', 'experience', 'daughter', 'even', 'rescue', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again', 'would', 'suspect', 'require', 'extensive', 'counseling', 'have', 'hope', 'resuming', 'normal', 'life', 'Post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'problem', 'soldier', 'could', 'take', 'years', 'negative', 'effects', 'experience', 'be', 'overcome', 'regard', 'ending', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'Pollyannaism.If', 'can', 'set', 'aside', 'reason', 'just', 'take', 'movie', 'what', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'packed', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', '91', 'minutes', 'relatively', 'short', 'rather', 'quickly', 'caveats', 'mentioned', 'can', 'recommend', 'exciting', 'action', 'movie']",Taken
1194336,AD566OQG88ORV,B001GCUNYO,David Feeney,"[0, 0]","By David Feeney, AuthorTerror On The High SeasAs I've said before, every decade has a film or two in the action genre that defines the age; Dirty Harry 70s, Lethal Weapon & First Blood 80s, Point Break 90s.I remember spotting a commercial for Taken on YouTube several months before the film arrived in the US. The film opened in Europe and made it's way slowly about the world. I kept tracking its earnings and was psyched to see it. I was not disappointed.Taken is a relentless action film. When Brian Mills' (Neeson)daughter is taken by sex slave traders while on a trip to Paris, Mills, a former CIA special services type springs into action.Seldom does a move live up to it's trailer. Usually the trailer showcases the best action scenes to lure an audience in. Not so with Taken. Taken delivers on the promise of its trailer. Daughter taken + Daddy goes ballistic = lots of dead scumbags!I cannot overemphasize this last point. Every scene in this film serves only to give Neeson more people to kill...all to our delight. I saw this in a theater with a good crowd. People were cheering with every shattered skull, ruptured larynx, bullet between the eyes or steak knife to the heart. Neeson is a force of nature as he moves from one act of carnage to the next.He even shoots his friend's wife! How's that for badass?There's also some great dialogue to boot.'I'll tear down the Eiffel tower if I have to!' (He says this to his friend in the French Secret Service!)'Now's not the time for dick measuring, Stuart!' (He says this to his X-wife's new husband!)'You either give me what I need or this switch will stay on until they turn the power off for lack of payment on the bill.' (He says this to a dude he's electrocuting)and who could forget...'I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.'Jeepers. I'm ttrembling as I type this.Be warned, there's no philosophy here. No attempt to understand why they do what they do. Nobody plants a placenta in a garden or remembrance or any of that nonsense. Neeson just leaves the dirty buggers behind. I don't know how many people he kills in this movie. I tried to count but lost track in all the excitement.For those of you who haven't seen Taken see it. And just remember...there is a Taken 2. And yes, the dummies come after him again.But no, it's not as good as the first.Enjoy.",5,This film raises the bar on badassedness.

1194341,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B001GCUNYO,David R. Eastwood,"[1, 23]","It appears that several dozens of people liked TAKEN despite its many plot holes (several of which are listed in the professional review on the first page of this marketing site). This film does have much that would appeal to teenage boys: lots of fast-cut action with flying fists and bullets, plenty of ""foreign"" villains who get wiped off the face of the earth by an American good guy with a righteous cause, and miles and miles of car chases! And, for middle-aged women, it has LIAM NEESON--towering over other men, emoting, flexing his middle-aged muscles, and saying all sorts of heart-fluttering semi-off-color things.There are many other heroic-fantasy films which are just as good when it comes to fast, violent action: the BOURNE trilogy, the TRANSPORTER series, and HITMAN with Timothy Olyphant come to mind. If a person, for whatever reason, prefers to see fast action mixed with an erotic component, then HITMAN is superior to TAKEN and these others.In this film,  Famke Janssen, as Neeson's character's ex-wife, is physically quite good looking (but unattractively bitchy most of the time). On the plus side, when it comes to screen presence, Liam Neeson still has it, and his delivery of the few witty lines of the script is effective.",2,"IF YOU'RE NOT A TEENAGE BOY OR MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, TRY ""HITMAN"" INSTEAD",1242259200,"05 14, 2009",2009,1250,"['several', 'dozens', 'people', 'liked', 'TAKEN', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'several', 'are', 'listed', 'professional', 'review', 'first', 'page', 'marketing', 'site', 'film', 'have', 'much', 'would', 'appeal', 'teenage', 'boys', 'lots', 'fast-cut', 'action', 'flying', 'fists', 'bullets', 'plenty', 'foreign', 'villains', 'who', 'get', 'wiped', 'off', 'face', 'earth', 'American', 'good', 'guy', 'righteous', 'cause', 'miles', 'miles', 'car', 'chases', 'middle-aged', 'women', 'LIAM', 'NEESON', 'towering', 'other', 'men', 'emoting', 'flexing', 'middle-aged', 'muscles', 'saying', 'sorts', 'heart-fluttering', 'semi-off-color', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'heroic-fantasy', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'when', 'fast', 'violent', 'action', 'BOURNE', 'trilogy', 'TRANSPORTER', 'series', 'HITMAN', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'come', 'mind', 'person', 'reason', 'prefers', 'see', 'fast', 'action', 'mixed', 'erotic', 'component', 'then', 'HITMAN', 'superior', 'TAKEN', 'others.In', 'film', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Neeson', 'character', 'ex-wife', 'physically', 'quite', 'good', 'looking', 'unattractively', 'most', 'time', 'plus', 'side', 'when', 'screen', 'presence', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'still', 'delivery', 'few', 'witty', 'lines', 'script', 'effective']",Taken

1194343,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,B001GCUNYO,D. Blankenship,"[3, 3]","There are literally thousands upon thousands of films to watch these days; films in any genre that you can possible think of.  Some of these films are great films, some are horrible and some are horrible and great at the same time.  It really all depends upon you mood and what you want to watch at any given time.  Now I normally like romantic comedies or films such as The Princess Bride.  But that being said, I also like a mixture in the type of movies I watch.  I do not like a complete steady diet of just one type.There are times I enjoy seeing a complete bang, bang kill everything in sight type of movie; one where the bad guy is really, really bad and get his or her just reward.  Call them revenge films, retribution films, breaking all the rules films, or what ever.  Now I would not want to watch this sort of film every day, or even ever week or month, but sometimes it can be a good thing.  It seems to satisfy some dark inner beastie lurking somewhere in my psyche.  Well this film filled that need, sort of like a fix, and I will be good to go now to other films for a few months.The story is quite simple; if simple you want it to be.  A young woman joins her good friend and they travel to Paris to spend the summer. This is against the better judgment of her father, played by Liam Neeson, one of my favorite actors.  As chance would have it, the girls are captured by some really evil, despicable, cruel, and thoroughly dislikable men and are to be sold into sexual enslavement.  The father, Neeson, happens to be an ex CIA agent with remarkable skills in seeking people out and killing them in uncounted unique ways, both with his hands and various weapons.  The story is about the father's search for his daughter and his efforts to locate her and restore her freedom.The story starts out rather slow which allows the story and characters to be set up and developed, if you will.  Only one act of violence is shown at first and it is rather mild compared to what is to come.  The entire cast of good guy characters are rather likable, even the ex-wife and her super rich husband who you want to dislike but really don't.Once the story gets started, i.e. the father arrives in Paris, then indeed this becomes a nonstop action thriller.  Like several other reviewers, I completely lost track of the body count after the first ten for fifteen.  These bad guys kept springing up all other and the nice thing about it was that they were the kind of villains you just love to hate.  The Neeson efficiently kills them all, some in groups, some one on one and in various ways using his many skills as needed.  Justice is swift in this little world and absolute. The father seems to be completely free of any restraint what so ever as far as the law goes and what little law there is to stop him is quickly brushed aside.Now is this the best action thriller ever made?  No.  Is this a movie similar to Neeson's past work, such as Schindler's list?  No.  Are the special effects award winning?  No.  Is this a highbrow movie that  you would want to take your date or wife to in order to impress her with your intellectual choice of cinemagraphic art, and set for hours afterwards spouting effusions and pontificating as to its greatness, noting subtle nuances she might have missed?  I don't think so!What this is, is a movie about a guy that kicks a lot of tail, kills a lot of people who richly deserve to be killed, and if you like such movies now and again, you will enjoy this one. It is a fantasy film and the deeds performed by our hero would indeed be quite impossible to perform in real life, or at least quite improbably.  That is what is nice about this film...it is hard core, high violence fantasy with out the blood and gore you are served up in movies such as the never ending Saw movies.  The acting is quite adequate and the story is interesting enough to hold your attention.

1194347,A8N5EM32PVLZJ,B001GCUNYO,Dean A. Anderson,"[2, 3]","During the summer of one of my college years I got a phone call from the father of a friend of mine. He needed me to take on an emergency house-sitting assignment. I agreed to do so, and then asked for the story behind the request.Parents John and Marg had for the first time left their 18 year old daughter home alone as they went on vacation. It was Fair season in Sonoma County, and Janet (the daughter) went with a friend. At the Fair, the girls found what most teenage girls are looking for: cute guys. Janet invited her ""new friends"" to her house to play pool. A good time was had by all, and the guys invited Janet and her friend to meet them the next night at the Fair.The next night, Janet couldn't find the guys at the Fair. She returned home to find that her home had been robbed. She called her parents in a panic, then went to stay at a friend's home. That's when I was called to house-sit. Janet's foolish choice to trust these strangers could have led to something very much worse.In the film Taken, a daughter's choice to trust a cute guy does lead to much worse. On a trip to Paris with a friend, she is abducted by sex slave traders. The sex trade is a real problem, but I would think the cable news networks would be giving the Paris airports a little more air time if they were as dangerous as they are portrayed in this movie. But realism is not this film's strong suit. It is a fantasy about a father who will do anything to save his daughter.And it is a fantasy many Americans have been anxious to share. This low budget French production screened in Europe a year ago and just hit American screens in January. With a fairly low wattage cast (no offense to Liam Neeson who played Oskar Schindler and Qui-Gon Jinn) and is very credible in his role) the film is looking to make $150 million  and has had a remarkable staying power in theaters.I think much of its popularity is due to its playing out two fantasies (really two sides of the fantasy coin.)One side of the fantasy is for the parent. Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a former government agent whose job kept him far from home, damaging his relationship with his daughter and ruining his marriage. His daughter thinks he is overprotective and worries too much. (When his daughter tells him he should worry less, he responds that is like telling water it should be less wet.) His daughter ignores his advice and goes to Europe with a friend. When she's abducted, it's up to her father to rescue her.And if he can rescue her, she'll see that her father was right, and she will finally appreciate him. Columnist Jonah Goldberg wrote a very funny review of this film in which he called it ""Patriarchal Porn"" -- not at all in the sexual sense, but rather that the film appeals to a parent's basic protective instincts. As a father, he wrote that the film fulfills the parental fantasy of seeing a child realize that indeed, father does know best.The other side of the fantasy is from the perspective of the child. (I did have a little difficulty seeing Maggie Grace as a ""17 year old child"" in the film, since I watched the actress play an older character in the first season of Lost a few years ago.)Still, the fantasy of a Rescuing Father is a powerful one: the idea that no matter how dire the situation, there is someone who will stop at nothing to rescue you. And Neeson in the film will certainly stop at nothing. He breaks international law, risks his own life and quite ruthlessly takes others' lives. At times, he makes 24's Jack Bauer seem rather effeminate.He will stop at nothing to save his daughter.Don't we wish someone cared for us like that?At this time of Easter, we remember we do have someone like that. We've made stupid choices. We choose to sin, and sin leads to death (Romans 6:23). But Jesus entered the world, and He would stop at nothing to save us. But instead of taking the lives of others, He gave up His own life (John 15:13, I Timothy 2:6).Watching the film, unless you are a much more worthy person than I am, you can't help wanting to cheer when you see corrupt kidnappers and sexual predators meet their nasty ends. In the real world, God sees even the worst of sinners as rebellious children that He loves and desires to save.When Jesus died on the cross and rose again, He proved Himself the Ultimate Action Hero.",4,Does Neeson Play Jesus in this Film?,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,4320,"['summer', 'one', 'college', 'years', 'got', 'phone', 'call', 'father', 'friend', 'mine', 'needed', 'take', 'emergency', 'house-sitting', 'assignment', 'agreed', 'do', 'so', 'then', 'asked', 'story', 'request.Parents', 'John', 'Marg', 'had', 'first', 'time', 'left', '18', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'home', 'alone', 'went', 'vacation', 'was', 'Fair', 'season', 'Sonoma', 'County', 'Janet', 'daughter', 'went', 'friend', 'Fair', 'girls', 'found', 'what', 'most', 'teenage', 'girls', 'are', 'looking', 'cute', 'guys', 'Janet', 'invited', 'new', 'friends', 'house', 'play', 'pool', 'good', 'time', 'was', 'had', 'guys', 'invited', 'Janet', 'friend', 'meet', 'next', 'night', 'Fair.The', 'next', 'night', 'Janet', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'guys', 'Fair', 'returned', 'home', 'find', 'home', 'had', 'been', 'robbed', 'called', 'parents', 'panic', 'then', 'went', 'stay', 'friend', 'home', 'when', 'was', 'called', 'house-sit', 'Janet', 'foolish', 'choice', 'trust', 'strangers', 'could', 'have', 'led', 'something', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'Taken', 'daughter', 'choice', 'trust', 'cute', 'guy', 'lead', 'much', 'worse', 'trip', 'Paris', 'friend', 'abducted', 'sex', 'slave', 'traders', 'sex', 'trade', 'real', 'problem', 'would', 'think', 'cable', 'news', 'networks', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'Paris', 'little', 'more', 'air', 'time', 'were', 'as', 'dangerous', 'are', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'realism', 'not', 'film', 'strong', 'suit', 'fantasy', 'father', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'save', 'daughter.And', 'fantasy', 'many', 'Americans', 'have', 'been', 'anxious', 'share', 'low', 'budget', 'French', 'production', 'screened', 'Europe', 'year', 'ago', 'just', 'hit', 'American', 'screens', 'January', 'fairly', 'low', 'wattage', 'cast', 'offense', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'played', 'Oskar', 'Schindler', 'Qui-Gon', 'Jinn', 'very', 'credible', 'role', 'film', 'looking', 'make', '150', 'million', 'had', 'remarkable', 'staying', 'power', 'theaters.I', 'think', 'much', 'popularity', 'due', 'playing', 'out', 'two', 'fantasies', 'really', 'two', 'sides', 'fantasy', 'coin', 'One', 'side', 'fantasy', 'parent', 'Neeson', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'former', 'government', 'agent', 'job', 'kept', 'far', 'home', 'damaging', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'ruining', 'marriage', 'daughter', 'overprotective', 'worries', 'too', 'much', 'When', 'daughter', 'should', 'worry', 'less', 'telling', 'water', 'should', 'be', 'less', 'wet', 'daughter', 'advice', 'Europe', 'friend', 'When', 'abducted', 'up', 'father', 'rescue', 'her.And', 'can', 'rescue', ""'ll"", 'see', 'father', 'was', 'right', 'will', 'finally', 'appreciate', 'Columnist', 'Jonah', 'Goldberg', 'wrote', 'very', 'funny', 'review', 'film', 'called', 'Patriarchal', 'Porn', 'not', 'sexual', 'sense', 'rather', 'film', 'appeals', 'parent', 'basic', 'protective', 'instincts', 'father', 'wrote', 'film', 'parental', 'fantasy', 'seeing', 'child', 'realize', 'indeed', 'father', 'know', 'best.The', 'other', 'side', 'fantasy', 'perspective', 'child', 'did', 'have', 'little', 'difficulty', 'seeing', 'Maggie', 'Grace', '17', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'film', 'watched', 'actress', 'play', 'older', 'character', 'first', 'season', 'Lost', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Still', 'fantasy', 'Rescuing', 'Father', 'powerful', 'one', 'idea', 'matter', 'how', 'situation', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'rescue', 'Neeson', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'stop', 'nothing', 'international', 'law', 'risks', 'own', 'life', 'quite', 'ruthlessly', 'others', 'lives', 'times', '24', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'seem', 'rather', 'effeminate.He', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'save', 'daughter.Do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'someone', 'cared', 'time', 'Easter', 'remember', 'do', 'have', 'someone', ""'ve"", 'made', 'stupid', 'choices', 'choose', 'sin', 'sin', 'leads', 'death', 'Romans', '6:23', 'Jesus', 'entered', 'world', 'would', 'stop', 'nothing', 'save', 'instead', 'taking', 'lives', 'others', 'gave', 'up', 'own', 'life', 'John', '15:13', 'Timothy', '2:6', '.Watching', 'film', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'worthy', 'person', 'am', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wanting', 'cheer', 'when', 'see', 'corrupt', 'kidnappers', 'sexual', 'predators', 'meet', 'nasty', 'ends', 'real', 'world', 'God', 'even', 'worst', 'sinners', 'rebellious', 'children', 'save.When', 'Jesus', 'died', 'cross', 'rose', 'again', 'proved', 'Ultimate', 'Action', 'Hero']",Taken

The first half-hour of the film was very engaging and the scene of the daughter's capture was intense. It stayed fairly intense for the rest of the movie, but my interest slowly declined from there, mainly because of the character progression of Neeson. Again, I will do my best not to spoil the movie for those who still have not seen it. In the beginning, Neeson is a very likable lead character. He portrays a credible father through the entire movie, there is no question about that. The problem arises when Neeson's daughter is taken and he assumes his role as ex-spy. Neeson throws away the good-natured, fatherly persona and becomes a violent James Bond-like figure, killing anyone and everyone that he sees. He almost becomes the bad guy in the film, lacking the qualities that set him apart from his enemies; basically becoming a mindless killing machine, especially by the end of the film. You still get the feeling that he'd do anything to get his daughter back, but you begin to wonder at what price. It's a pretty vengeful movie.**Spoiler Alert**The movie ends pretty quickly. Neeson finds where his daughter is, bursts in, guns blazing, and kills everyone in a matter of minutes. The thing that bothered me the most about this film is after Neeson gets his daughter back. They return to America and suddenly everything is back to normal and its like the whole thing never happened. Everyone's happy and wonderful and untraumatized. Sure, the daughter has a better relationship with her father, but other than that, nothing has changed from the beginning of the movie. I hated that! Annoyed the heck out of me. It's like they could have cut out everything in-between and you still would have had the same ending. Grrr.. never do that; completely takes away anything to be gained from the film.As far as questionable content:**Spoiler Alert** - The daughter is part of a large group of women that are being sold as sex slaves to foreign men, so you can imagine what the women are all wearing, or almost not wearing, during the bidding scene. There are a couple other scenes that deal with this content that are a bit risky.**Non-Spoiler Alert** - The movie is a fairly violent film. Lots of shooting and hand-to-hand-to-knife combat stuff going on. So, be ready to see violence.There is some profanity, but no ""F""-bomb.

As horrific as all this is, the quick pace of the story, forces us to react as quickly as Neeson does as he forges along through his once familiar stomping ground foiling the plans of an Albanian gang intent on human trafficking when they snatch the virginal Kim during a vacation in Paris.Neeson takes no prisoners.  He is a one-man killing machine.  Ludicrously, the bullets fly, the fists slam into faces and kidneys with the same lethal accuracy displayed by celluloid hero, Jason Bourne played by Matt Damon but without Bourne's robotic nonchalance.  Papa Neeson's face bleeds with anguish raw enough for the audience to warily sense like some automatic hormonal discharge that one can smell and taste and rawer still to barely interpret as something so distressful, lingering on it for too many seconds would shatter the rationale to a point of being unable to function.  Neeson conveys this reaching of his emotional limit and his need to turn away from dwelling on it to perfection.  As he stumbles through a tented makeshift whorehouse on a construction site, pulling back curtain after curtain revealing one stoned and under-aged girl after another, we see the pain in his eyes.  The images flash with such feral brutality and stark intensity that we know he must push them from his mind to achieve the goal of finding his girl. Neeson works this part with such emotional nuance, that when he flattens each of his adversaries, there is no question in the audience's mind on how he did it.  We simply believe it.Bottom line?  ""Taken"" follows the Bourne trilogy school of rapid-fire action cinema.

Fox presents an adequate transfer (unfortunately rather rare for the studio), but the DTS sound was a pleasure. It was watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and Panasonic BD35 player. Given the extensive fighting, shooting, and other action scenes, I thoroughly enjoyed the DTS treatment. The picture was grainy in some dark shots, but overall very crisp.Though some reviews across numerous sites have remarked that Liam Neeson was an odd cast for this highly physical film, I disagree. In order to take on an underground women prostitution smuggling ring, singlehandledly, a mature, seasoned and perfection-driven type would need to be cast. He portrayed the girl's father and his skillset in a convincing manner.The pace of the film is very fast, and was a bit too fast for me, in rushing along the character development. The acting was a bit robotic in parts, especially of the daughter, who seemed overly excited and hysterical in normal scenes (not after she had been kidnapped, obviously). In parts it seemed like the director or actors ""tried too hard"" to create drama, and whether in the script, or the execution, it was a little ""over the top"". The story was over the top, of course, and quite dramatic, but the delivery seemed a bit overblown.Still, I can see how this was dubbed one of the best action movies of the year, as the centerline story of a dad fighting for his daughter in a very dangerous situation is a very powerful concept for humanity.

Well, they picked on the wrong teenager, as agent Mills (Liam Neeson plays this delightfully close to the vest) is about to show them all who's your Daddy.  Putting all his clandestine skills to task, Mills mows through the Paris underground like a weedeater on acid, doing mega damage to all who stand in his way.

After all, kidnappers who are after $$ have little incentive to kidnap people who are of a modest financial worth.  Human trafficking, on the other hand, is an entirely different animal.  It can happen to anyone, anytime, as selling the person to a 3rd party is the objective, rather than selling the individual back to their family / friends.For this reason, this movie is a must-see as it sheds a much needed light on an all too frequent egregious practice.

Conforti,"[14, 15]","SYNOPSISFormer government operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) had given up his career as a so-called ""preventer"" to be close to his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Even though Bryan joins his former colleagues for side jobs to make ends meet, he spends most of his time to be a part of his daughter's life again. Soon, Bryan gets hit hard when Kim requests permission to go to Paris with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy). Knowing what dangers lie ahead in a foreign country, he says no at first, but Kim's disappointment leads him to a reluctant yes. Soon after they land, Bryan's fears are soon realized when Kim and her friend get abducted by unknown assailants from their apartment - in broad daylight. Before getting dragged away, she phones Bryan and starts leaving him clues. This begins the longest 96-hours of his life - a hunt that will take him to the deepest, darkest corners of Paris and face unbelievable nightmares worse than he experienced in black ops. And Bryan will make sure that no one will stop him from saving his daughter.MOVIEWhat can I say? This is one hell of a roller coaster ride from beginning to end! This is Liam Neeson at his best! Taken delivers on the action, drama and suspense it promises. There is never a dull moment! My favorite part of the movie was when his daughter gets abducted, the assailant picks up her phone and Liam tells him:""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.""This will easily be one of the most memorable movie quotes for many years to come. Phenomenal movie!PICTURE QUALITYOther than some grainy shots in a few scenes, the PQ is perfect. Nice, sharp gritty picture.AUDIO QUALITYWhoa mama!

Liam Neeson does a convincing job of demonstrating the virility and vitality of the aging Baby Boomer. He's what Jason Bourne grows up to be.  Neeson's character doesn't knock you over with quick quips and a bevy of beauties.  He's merely a dedicated former government agent who has learned some ""tricks"" of the trade.  The screenwriter did an excellent job of creating a ""He-man"" without becoming a clich&eacute;'. By Neeson recovering his daughter where his ex-wife's new rich husband isn't able to rise to the occasion, says the man who can really protect his family with sheer prowess is the better man. How could the ex-wife go back to a normal life when the real man (Neeson) lives across town? Of course, all this is subtle subtext.The salient point is that Neeson is amoral, doing what is appropriate for the situation to affect an ideal outcome.  Neeson does the unthinkable in ways that are believable. No extraordinary special effects, no superhuman feats only possible for a man 20 years younger. In short, just plain old ""Americana."" Man encounters challenge. Man meets challenge head-on. Man triumphs!I highly recommend ""Taken"".

1194378,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B001GCUNYO,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[4, 4]","Liam Neeson is a government retiree who has devoted his life to his work. His ex-wife has since devoted herself to a new husband, and now Neeson attempts to reconnect to his teenage daughter. We get a glimpse of his prior life when former colleagues coax him into a security detail for protecting a pop star. With cat-like reflexes and skill he quickly dispatches an attacker and gets his star to safety.Cynical about the world he worked in, Neeson is pressured by his daughter and ex to allow the girl to take a chaperone-free trip to the City of Lights. He is torn between his fear for his daughter's safety and losing a relationship with her by saying no.The trip soon turns ugly when her daughter sees her friend being abducted from another room. She knows she is next and quickly calls her father on the cell phone he gave her. When the abductors find her she leaves the cell phone on and it is picked up by the abductor. The father offers a carrot and a stick. If they leave his daughter alone, he will forget their crime, otherwise he will find them and kill them. The abductor is foolish enough to say, ""good luck!"" before he hangs up.When he arrives in Paris, the action really begins and there is a spike in metropolitan crime with what he does and what he learns.  A father is out to rescue his daughter and there is no time to spare. It leaves him no room for subtlety or diplomatic courtesies. The dialogue is intelligent and fast-paced, and Neeson is always convincing in whatever role he plays. In fact, you even forget the others except for the French inspector.If you like to see death by Kleenex, where one person dies slowly over the course of the script, this is probably not your cup of tea. ""La Chocolat"" it is not. However, if you like to see a lot of strangers die violently throughout the movie than hold on to your black belt, because this is right up your alley.""Taken"" should be borrowed or bought and watched.

1194379,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001GCUNYO,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","Since this film is approaching 3 years of age, there is no hesitation on my part to reveal spoilers--because you have to hear about all these, if you haven't seen this movie, in order to really make you want to see it. If you've seen it, maybe I can convince you how much better this film is than you already think it is!The best thing about this film is that it was shown on the heels of the awful, overrated ""Casino Royale"". This film has Liam Neeson at his level best, and I wondered after watching it why Neeson wasn't picked to be the next James Bond. He sure delivers in this film. Other than looking a bit thin and haggard, Neeson is brilliant.Story: it is what all film ought to be, clean, solid goal-oriented, no distractions. It's essentially a remake of Steven Segal's horrible 2003 offering ""Belly of the Beast""--an ex-CIA operative finds his darling daughter has been kidnapped by a prostitution ring, while on a trip to Paris. Same as Beast, except no Segal, no silly mysticism and no Thailand. I loved that this film was pure Neeson.In ""Taken"", Neeson SHINES. This man starts out the film as a poor schlmiel, divorced from his wife, competing with his wife's powerfully wealthy new husband--a man who is stealing the daughter's attention and affection. The way Neeson is left standing around makes one ache for him. His deep love for his daughter transcends all boundaries and anyone with a daughter will resonate. Neeson has a common-man tenderness and sincerity about him that few actors have.It is not immediately apparent that he was ever anyone of significance: he dresses like Dustin Hoffman. He seems to slouch; no Indiana Jones bravado for him. He can't, because no one is supposed to know exactly what he did before he retired. We get a few clues at first when he gathers with pals for a barbecue. Later he tells his inquisitive daughter, rather warily, ""I was gone so much because I worked for the government.""But when he vows to find and rescue his kidnapped daughter, Neeson and this film are all business--the best kind of business. Neeson is relentless and unstoppable. He shows what CIA and Langley AFB training is really about: when he shoots, he shoots to kill and does it with one bullet. No rookie aerosol hails of bullets; one target, one bullet, as training dictates.The kills are immediate and thorough, so no one springs up later to try another pot-shot at him. He wastes no resources, and since his time is never wasted, the viewer's time isn't wasted. Neeson is playing American, so I'd like to add that his accent, pure and basic, never slips once.Neeson is believable because the film is believable. ""Taken"" is well acted, well written and, yes, it got a bit silly (it strove for a PG-13 rating so it occasionally approaches an almost Disney-esque air). I recall it was hyped somewhat, then dropped dead. Can't imagine why, since '08 was a rather distracted, uneven year for film releases, much like the following year was.This film is terrific because it is for the action fan and faint-hearted alike: Neeson does no idiotic stunts, he flows as if he's dancing, and there is little in the way of graphic garbage so common today (except for the harrowing phone call with his daughter while she's being abducted, and of course the scene in which he tortures a man for information, CIA style--that was a political statement and not a gruesome exercize...hardly graphic nonsense).The kills are so very realistic, I had to point it out to my wife who merely said, ""God, that was fast!"" It is like it happens for agents in real life, I was able to use those scenes as examples for my wife in case she ever has to defend herself (God forbid), and that is why I highly recommend this film as a shining example of the U.S. goverment agent/CIA/spy-on-a-spree genre. It is all quality, all action, and an unforeseen yet perfect Neeson vehicle.Even if Neeson got nothing out of it, buy it and cherish it as the best you'll ever see in retired-agent's-child-is-kidnapped. Neeson is better than Segal and Daniel Craig any day, in my book.",5,"I WAS TAKEN WITH ""TAKEN""",1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,4067,"['film', 'approaching', '3', 'years', 'age', 'hesitation', 'part', 'reveal', 'spoilers', 'have', 'hear', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'order', 'really', 'make', 'want', 'see', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'maybe', 'can', 'convince', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'already', 'think', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'shown', 'heels', 'awful', 'overrated', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'film', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'level', 'best', 'wondered', 'watching', 'why', 'Neeson', 'was', ""n't"", 'picked', 'be', 'next', 'James', 'Bond', 'sure', 'delivers', 'film', 'Other', 'looking', 'bit', 'thin', 'haggard', 'Neeson', 'brilliant.Story', 'what', 'film', 'ought', 'be', 'clean', 'solid', 'goal-oriented', 'distractions', 'essentially', 'remake', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'horrible', '2003', 'offering', 'Belly', 'Beast', 'ex-CIA', 'operative', 'darling', 'daughter', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'prostitution', 'ring', 'trip', 'Paris', 'Same', 'Beast', 'Segal', 'silly', 'mysticism', 'Thailand', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'pure', 'Neeson.In', 'Taken', 'Neeson', 'SHINES', 'man', 'out', 'film', 'poor', 'schlmiel', 'divorced', 'wife', 'competing', 'wife', 'powerfully', 'wealthy', 'new', 'husband', 'man', 'who', 'stealing', 'daughter', 'attention', 'affection', 'way', 'Neeson', 'left', 'standing', 'around', 'one', 'ache', 'deep', 'love', 'daughter', 'boundaries', 'anyone', 'daughter', 'will', 'resonate', 'Neeson', 'common-man', 'tenderness', 'sincerity', 'few', 'actors', 'have.It', 'not', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'was', 'ever', 'anyone', 'significance', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'slouch', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'bravado', 'ca', ""n't"", 'one', 'supposed', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'did', 'retired', 'get', 'few', 'clues', 'first', 'when', 'pals', 'barbecue', 'Later', 'inquisitive', 'daughter', 'rather', 'warily', 'was', 'gone', 'so', 'much', 'worked', 'government', 'when', 'find', 'rescue', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'Neeson', 'film', 'are', 'business', 'best', 'kind', 'business', 'Neeson', 'relentless', 'unstoppable', 'what', 'CIA', 'Langley', 'AFB', 'training', 'really', 'when', 'shoots', 'shoots', 'kill', 'one', 'bullet', 'rookie', 'hails', 'bullets', 'one', 'target', 'one', 'bullet', 'training', 'dictates.The', 'kills', 'are', 'immediate', 'thorough', 'so', 'one', 'up', 'later', 'try', 'pot-shot', 'resources', 'time', 'never', 'wasted', 'viewer', 'time', ""n't"", 'wasted', 'Neeson', 'playing', 'American', ""'d"", 'like', 'add', 'accent', 'pure', 'basic', 'never', 'once.Neeson', 'believable', 'film', 'believable', 'Taken', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'written', 'yes', 'got', 'bit', 'silly', 'strove', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'occasionally', 'almost', 'Disney-esque', 'air', 'recall', 'was', 'hyped', 'somewhat', 'then', 'dropped', 'dead', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', ""'08"", 'was', 'rather', 'distracted', 'uneven', 'year', 'film', 'releases', 'much', 'following', 'year', 'was.This', 'film', 'terrific', 'action', 'fan', 'faint-hearted', 'alike', 'Neeson', 'idiotic', 'stunts', 'dancing', 'little', 'way', 'graphic', 'garbage', 'so', 'common', 'today', 'harrowing', 'phone', 'call', 'daughter', 'being', 'abducted', 'course', 'scene', 'man', 'information', 'CIA', 'style', 'was', 'political', 'statement', 'not', 'gruesome', 'exercize', 'hardly', 'graphic', 'nonsense', '.The', 'kills', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'realistic', 'had', 'point', 'wife', 'who', 'merely', 'said', 'God', 'was', 'fast', 'agents', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'able', 'use', 'scenes', 'examples', 'wife', 'case', 'ever', 'defend', 'God', 'forbid', 'why', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'shining', 'example', 'U.S.', 'goverment', 'agent/CIA/spy-on-a-spree', 'genre', 'quality', 'action', 'unforeseen', 'yet', 'perfect', 'Neeson', 'vehicle.Even', 'Neeson', 'got', 'nothing', 'buy', 'cherish', 'best', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', ""retired-agent's-child-is-kidnapped"", 'Neeson', 'better', 'Segal', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'day', 'book']",Taken
1194380,AT2ONGBAQ8HFD,B001GCUNYO,Ema Nnep,"[3, 3]","A weapon, by simple definition, is a tool used to protect one's self or others from harm.  The hero in this story is a living, breathing weapon who, in his own words, was a 'preventor' when he worked for the government in an obviously highly skilled special ops unit once the action starts.The cost for his dedication and diligence was his family.  His wife left him and took their daughter, marrying a very wealthy business man who raises up his daughter as his little princess while the ex wife clearly allows her bitterness to show to their daughter.So, when Neeson's character 'retires' to civilian life, all he has is a home movie of his daughter's last birthday under his roof, a single digit birthday where she gives a happy, adoring smile into the camera to show off her missing front tooth and blows out the candle on her birthday cake.  He has a single photo album in which he has a single photo from each of his daughter's subsequent birthdays until this one, her seventeenth.He is a man who has the time to consider everything he does with purpose when it comes to his daughter and her happiness.  He keeps his distance from the ex and the new husband, but makes an effort to maintain a pleasant relationship with the man who is helping to raise his daughter in his stead. He obviously loves his daughter and she loves him, managing well enough not allow her mother's bitterness to cloud her relationship with her father, but as any teen would, she does use her mother's feelings to her advantage as we soon see.As you watch the first few moments of the movie you get a picture of how lonely this man is, how much he sacrificed and while he does not regret that sacrifice, he does wish that he knew how to make things better, to re-establish a relationship with his daughter when she is on the cusp of adulthood and spreading her wings.And her first act of spreading those wings is to go to Paris with her best friend to stay at the friend's cousin's home.  Now, because Neesom's character knows how ugly the real world is, he's not on board with this, especially with the way daughter and mom spring it on him the day after her birthday.  Because she is underrage they need his signature on paperwork to allow her to travel out of the country, and if Daddy doesn't approve, she can't go, so little missy turns on the water works and Daddy caves.  Unfortunately, when they arrive at the airport, he discovers that his daughter isn't going over to Paris for a simple vacation but they're following a band across Europe to attend all their concerts.Angry at being lied to and against his better judgment, he allows his daughter to go on the trip and within an hour of the girls arriving at their destination, they are kidnapped.His daughter happened to be away from the action with it first starts and she's on her cell phone with him, relaying what she's seeing through the window as her friend is being physically hauled out of the apartment.  His training kicks in and he's now a father and a highly trained special ops soldier and while he's telling his daughter what he needs to know in real time, he also has to tell her that there isn't going to be any way to stop her kidnapping.The look on his face when he hears his daughter screaming for him makes you feel that moment right in the pit of your stomach and when the kidnapper picks up the cell phone after they take his daughter, he spells it out for them loud and clear:  I don't have money but I have a specific skill set.  You let my daughter go or I will hunt you down and kill you.The bad guys think he's joking or blustering but he is serious and with the help of his old team and resources, he's on the move, heading to Paris and he starts with the creep at the airport who targeted the girls for the crew to kidnap and works his way up the foodchain.He's been told his clock is 96 hours before he'll never be able to find his daughter and he's not wasting a second of that time playing nice or taking prisoners.  His daughter has been sold into a prostitution ring and he's not letting anyone who had any involvement in the organization off the hook.  He doesn't stop, he doesn't negotiate, he doesn't quibble, he's hunting for his daughter and every time another truly sleazy bad guy bites the dust you can't help but cheer for him.The uncut version vs. the theatrical version is superior only in that you see him serving out the punishment these pigs deserve and it gives you a certain sense of satisfaction and justice that they don't prevail this time and they won't get a chance to victimize anyone else.While there is a good deal of violence, it's not gory like a horror film, and there is alot of high intensity action that culminates in the rescue that you're holding your breath for.It's a thrill ride and entertaining but it also has some clear lessons about the consequences of the choices we make.",5,What wouldn't you do to get your

I do like some of Besson's movies, particularly Femme Nikita and The Professional. Likewise, I've always felt Liam Neeson's films had a certain level of class.Taken is written at a surface level. The characters are not developed very deeply, and the movie is mostly about intrigue and action -- a bit of the former, but mostly the latter. Action is of the Jason Bourne type -- walk into a roomful of bad guys and render them all helpless in 15 seconds. A little unrealistic for a man of any age, let alone Neeson's. Think Indiana Jones in revenge mode.As a pure action movie, it is competent and exciting, if a bit formulaic. I'm afraid that I've seen enough of these types of films that the sheer kinetic energy of some of the scenes is not enough for me. I think a quieter, more sleuth-like sniffing out the trail leading to the hero's kidnapped daughter would have been more dramatic, even if it induced less adrenalin. And a lower body count, with slower kills of the really really bad guys might actually have been more cathartic.The ending seemed a bit abrupt. For example, there's no exposition on how the French authorities cleaned up the messes our hero exposes and leaves behind, and how they deal with the corruption in their midst. I wanted to see that resolved.And while the cause seems just, I'm still just a bit uncomfortable with the special forces-style vigilantism that is glorified here.If you don't want to think too hard, and watch a lot of nameless sinister folk get quickly shot or pummelled into submission, Taken will occupy you for an evening.",3,Disappointing.

There is no awkwardness, no ""message,"" no random and unfulfilling subplot--just a good set-up followed by a relentless pursuit.Liam Neeson plays ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills, a haggard retiree who lives alone and wants only to have a good relationship with his semi-estranged daughter.  Bryan's buddies needle him about a life with nothing to do, and convince him to protect a famous singer for a one-time job--which allows for the obligatory ""you don't want to mess with this guy"" scene early in the movie.  He then very reluctantly allows his daughter to go to Paris, where she is kidnapped by a high-end prostitution ring.That's the first act, and although it takes a little while to unfold, all the elements are necessary for an understanding of what happens later in the movie.  Once Bryan Mills is off and running, your eyes will never leave the screen.Neeson is perfectly cast here, using his athletic, intimidating physique (he was once a boxer) to great effect in many confrontations.  ""Taken"" is a white-knuckle pursuit, and both the chases around Europe and the fight scenes recall the James Bond and Jason Bourne movies, and the rather underrated ""Ronin.""  In fact, it occurred to me while watching ""Taken"" that Neeson might have made a better Bond than Pierce Brosnan.  Neeson is a bit too old for it now, and Daniel Craig has shown himself more than capable as everyone's favorite spy.  But Neeson's brutal physicality, combined with his emotive physiognomy, makes Bryan Mills a character everyone roots for.If you're looking for complex character development, Bryan Mills is no Oskar Schindler--but that's hardly the point of ""Taken.""

The plot is anything but new - back in 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger as retired elite commando had only a few hours to find and rescue his daughter from an exiled dictator. The first and by far the best season of hit TV series 24 had Kiefer Sutherland as LA based CTU Agent Jack Bauer chasing of all sorts of terrorists who taken his teenage daughter. In its bets moments, Taken brings as much excitement and adrenalin as these classics. Another thought came to my mind while watching the movie, if ever Liam Neeson was considered for the part of Bond, James Bond? If not 007 himself, he could have easily been s Bond's older brother, less glamorous but as dangerous and deadly.Taken touches on horrific but sadly existing and blooming business of international women trafficking, the slave trade of our times. Do not expect the movie make some serious social comments or provide the deep insight into the dirtiest business possible. Neeson's hero is not out to save thousands of lost forever young women, he is trying to find and safe one girl only who just happened not to know how lucky she was to have a deadly killing machine for a dad. I don't recall when was last time I felt as satisfied as when Bryan let disgusting and despicable villains of different social standings have it with great vengeance and furious anger. I saw perfectly clear all movie's weaknesses and clich&eacute;s while I was watching it but it never bored me, it was non-stopping action, and it had a hero whom I desperately want to succeed. Perfect or not - I liked Taken a lot and would recommend it without hesitation.",4,"""..I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.

The driver of this well written (Luc Besson! and Robert Mark Kamen), well directed (Pierre Morel) film is the non-stop violence filled mission of a desperate father whose skills at getting to the heart of a matter have not been diminished by his 'early retirement'.Liam Neeson is in grand form as Bryan Mills, the skilled and committed father who can out kill and out wit even the most vicious of the Albanian forces against whom he must struggle to save his kidnapped daughter from being sold into human slavery to an Arab sheik. The film moves so rapidly, with the skills of cinematographer Michel Abramowicz, that the various other characters who populate this drama scarcely have time to establish an identity (Famke Janssen, Radivoje Bukvic, Maggie Grace et al).  The violence is constant but due to Bryan Mills' skills each death is so rapid that the camera doesn't linger  There are scenes in the brothels where the drug induced young girls serve as prostitutes that are quite disturbing, but again the camera doesn't pause long enough to make them gruesome.This is a fine performance by Liam Neeson who demonstrates a mastery of the action roles that likely will lead to others in a similar vein.

1194408,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B001GCUNYO,Graves,"[1, 1]","In *Taken* Liam Neeson plays a former spy who is desperately trying to get back into the life of his estranged daughter. The problem is that while he is an outstanding spy, he is pathetically out of touch with his daughter. For her seventeenth birthday he shows up with a karaoke machine and her wealthy step father gives her a horse. But when, on a summer trip to France, she is grabbed by white slavers, it is Neeson whose skills come into play.What follows is a run around Paris and its environs as Neeson hunts for his daughter among the Parisian underworld while avoiding the French police who really object to the trail of bodies he leaves in his wake.Neeson is a great actor and is believable as the spy. In a world where the TV and movies have all too many beautiful young things as super spies he comes across as the real deal. He is intense about finding his daughter but to get information he can play the charming gentleman or the clueless tourist until he unveils what lies beneath and can display a casual brutality towards anyone who gets in his way.Unfortunately while Neeson is believable the pacing is not. Although we are told he has a 96 hour window until his daughter is lost in the underworld forever, there is no sense of pressure or tension as Neeson quickly steps over every obstacle in the way. There is no belief he won't find his daughter, it seems as inevitable as water flowing downhill so as the violence and body count goes up, the feeling of suspense goes down. Compared with a similar issue in Schwartzzennegger's ""Commando"" from the 1980's where an actor much worse tham Neesom is able to project the sense of time running, this shows it can be done.Because of images shown in the TV commercial for the film that do not appear in the film, Neeson driving spikes into the thighs of a man he tortures for example, I suspect the editor gets the blame for this failure, that in trying to cut the time of the film he eliminated character/plot development in favor of keeping in the action scenes.Neeson's character has a brutal dark side that some actors would shy away from but he embraces it without reducing himself and those are the best scenes in the film. The end product is a film that's fun to watch, a great actor in a wonderful setting but there's nothing here that will matter to you. To revel in a victory you have to feel there was a challenge to reach it and that is missing here.",4,"Loving father, dark sided spy",1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,2424,"['*Taken*', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'former', 'spy', 'who', 'desperately', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'life', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'problem', 'outstanding', 'spy', 'pathetically', 'touch', 'daughter', 'seventeenth', 'birthday', 'up', 'karaoke', 'machine', 'wealthy', 'step', 'father', 'horse', 'when', 'summer', 'trip', 'France', 'grabbed', 'white', 'slavers', 'Neeson', 'skills', 'come', 'play.What', 'run', 'around', 'Paris', 'environs', 'Neeson', 'hunts', 'daughter', 'Parisian', 'underworld', 'avoiding', 'French', 'police', 'who', 'really', 'object', 'trail', 'bodies', 'wake.Neeson', 'great', 'actor', 'believable', 'spy', 'world', 'where', 'TV', 'movies', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'beautiful', 'young', 'things', 'super', 'spies', 'real', 'deal', 'intense', 'finding', 'daughter', 'get', 'information', 'can', 'play', 'charming', 'gentleman', 'clueless', 'tourist', 'what', 'beneath', 'can', 'display', 'casual', 'brutality', 'towards', 'anyone', 'who', 'way.Unfortunately', 'Neeson', 'believable', 'pacing', 'not', 'are', 'told', '96', 'hour', 'window', 'daughter', 'lost', 'underworld', 'forever', 'sense', 'pressure', 'tension', 'Neeson', 'quickly', 'over', 'obstacle', 'way', 'belief', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'daughter', 'as', 'inevitable', 'water', 'flowing', 'downhill', 'so', 'violence', 'body', 'count', 'up', 'feeling', 'suspense', 'down', 'Compared', 'similar', 'issue', 'Schwartzzennegger', 'Commando', '1980', 'where', 'actor', 'much', 'worse', 'tham', 'Neesom', 'able', 'project', 'sense', 'time', 'running', 'can', 'be', 'done.Because', 'images', 'shown', 'TV', 'commercial', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'film', 'Neeson', 'driving', 'spikes', 'thighs', 'man', 'example', 'suspect', 'editor', 'blame', 'failure', 'trying', 'cut', 'time', 'film', 'eliminated', 'character/plot', 'development', 'favor', 'keeping', 'action', 'scenes.Neeson', 'character', 'brutal', 'dark', 'side', 'actors', 'would', 'shy', 'away', 'reducing', 'are', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'end', 'product', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'great', 'actor', 'wonderful', 'setting', 'nothing', 'here', 'will', 'matter', 'revel', 'victory', 'have', 'feel', 'there', 'was', 'challenge', 'reach', 'missing', 'here']",Taken

You won't find much of the pointless effects in this one. This one has a story behind it.Enter Brian, a retired special forces operator who wants only to spend time wiht his daughter, access to whom is blocked by his estranged ex-wife and new husband. While he does his best to ensure she knows he loves her, she is a teenager and is really only concerned with herself. When she lies to him for permission to go to Paris, he reluctantly allows it provided she follow some requirements. She cannot even fulfill the first, which is to call him when the plane lands. While she is an innocent, he has traveled the world trouble-shooting and knows the dangers that await the unwary. Dangers that find his innocent daughter when she is kidnapped to be sold into slavery.Now, while he had been retired to be close to her, she has not been taken from him. Retirement is postponed. His pursuit is fast, brutal and relentless. The criminals who seek to prevent his recovery get shown no mercy. We see wonderfully choreographed fight scenes, quick and severe as they should be considering the stakes. We get to see the difference between mere thugs and a trained military professional. The criminals don't deserve mercy. Plowing through the seedy underworld of Paris, Brian moves further and further along the chain until he learns where his daughter is being sold.Overcoming adversity after obstacle after impediment, Brian refuses to give up. The final scenes show this determination come to the fore as he ignores wounds to continue his mission. While some of the gunplay near the end gets a bit extravagant, with automatic weapons being sprayed as stunt performers dive behind furniture somewhat reminiscent of Bruckheimer movies, it is for the most part well-done and not over glorified. It's a dirty business and it's shown that way.The stunt driving is extraordinary, not as fantastic as Ronin but certainly close to the same league. The story marches on without needless diversions, and while the resolution comes somewhat abruptly, with no bridge between the final act of retribution and the return to the States, it's forgiveable.While I would have liked Brian to tell his daughter off a bit about why he'd given her the rules in the first place, he's just not an ""I told you so"" kinda guy. He does what he does, he loves his daughter, and he's forthright about it all.While this version does give the theatrical and extended versions, there are no other special features. If you need the commentaries and behind the scenes features, you should limit yourself to the two-disc set.

That should make the kids waver a bit. And I bet those poor souls in HOSTEL were wishing for a parent like Liam Neeson. My favorite part of TAKEN may well be the low key yet very ominous promise Neeson makes on the phone to the kidnappers who had just snatched his daughter. I got de shivers of anticipation up and down the spine, watching him make this little speech in the film trailer; in the actual film, it resonates with even more power.- Liam Neeson's character: ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have... are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you. I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you.""- The response: ""Good luck.""Oh, it is so on now, brother!Plot, simple: Ex-black ops agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) retired so that he can spend time with his neglected 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), although nowadays Kim doesn't really have much time for him. But she manages to guilt him into signing his permission for her to go holidaying in Europe. Mills doesn't like it one bit. He knows how the real world works, but his daughter just wants to follow a rock band as it tours across Europe. Mills' worst fears surface when Kim and her friend are promptly kidnapped in Paris. But Bryan Mills isn't your ordinary dad and he immediately leaps into action.Clocking in at slightly over an hour and a half, TAKEN is a stripped-down bare-knuckled thriller, doesn't try to be fancy, doesn't overcomplicate the story. It's about a father, trained in espionage and combat, willing to do whatever is needed, willing to take on anyone in his way, to get his daughter back. And that's it. Above all, this movie works because it's Liam Neeson propelling the story. Neeson is a first-rate actor and the man can convey seething rage and righteous fury like nobody's business. And, for someone in his 50s, he brings such big physical presence to the screen that you buy into his character being this dangerous and capable and ruthless.A geriatric version of Jack Bauer? Yes - this man does not eff around. Some of the brutal things Mills resorts to has him straddling the fence between good guy and villain. But I tend to forgive him, given what's driving him. But, heh, it's pretty much a given that his friendship with his French contact is now effectively ruined.Holes in the film? Yes, some. Although it's just about a given that Mills is able to survive hail after hail of bullets; that just seems to go with the territory, in these films. But Bryan Mills, impressive spy skills aside, does get by some on preposterous sheer luck (especially with the jacket). And then, after wreaking so much havoc in Paris, he seemingly is able to get out of France with his daughter fairly easily. See, father and daughter reunite and hug it out in Paris. Next thing you know, they're strolling in L.A.X. (although, okay, for all we know, they may have spent frustrating weeks in Paris swimming thru red tape; the movie doesn't indicate how much time has elapsed). My biggest gripe lies in the shakedown scene, when Mills accosts the Albanians in their HQ and pretends to be French authority - while talking in English with not even a French accent, much less actually speaking in French. And the saps buy this? Unless, of course, Mills pulled the old Jedi mind trick on them. In which case, it all makes sense.But I'm just nagging.

It's pretty much a foregone conclusion that you'll be groomed and sold into sex slavery the literal second you step off the plane. Paris in particular is swarming with prozzies and greasy crooks from some former Soviet block hellhole who kidnap pretty young girls, hook them on drugs, and sell them to morbidly obese Sultans while setting-up sex cabins on building sites, holding sex eBays in the basements of upper class parties, and living in all-male rape communes with the proceeds from their unscrupulous businesses being kept in a coffee can on the kitchen shelf.And producer/director Luc Besson and Pierre Morel are French too, so they know what they are talking about. Liam Neeson knows it too, but his sullen ex-wife believes the world to be full of sunshine and candy and has no problem with sending their unnaturally juvenile 17-year-old daughter off to Paris with her slut best friend. Just as daddy predicted, the dirty foreign animals grab her and hoist her away for auction.Luckily for daddy he has a very particular set of skills that make him a nightmare for foreigners and he goes off to Paris to raise hell. The detective element is played down, down, down (Neeson collects hair samples for no particular reason, never bothers to hide his accent) and the merciless xenophobia is cranked up, up, up. It's not much different from Death Wish in that the crimes established in the first act are merely there to justify the sadism that follows.The film is not that vivid however. Had it been made in the 80s I am sure that the violence would be visceral and effective, but in the post-Bourne world it's shot and cut in a way where you can't really see anything, regardless of which version you are watching.The material is thin, the action is only slightly above tepid, and the killing never really goes beyond gunplay.

I hated the gore in Hostel. Taken was much more serious. Unfortunately, despite the good message it could have had, it was full of too many impossible situations. But in any case, I am glad I didn't see any of these three movies before going to Europe on my own at the age of 22.The father (the former spy) is concerned about his daughter going to Paris. Understandable. He seemed a little over-protective. But he was totally balanced out by the mother who was completely unconcerned about anything and went so far as to help the daughter lie about her plans! ""She just couldn't tell him the truth,"" the poor girl. So museums aren't for everybody. Personally I find sculptures and ancient relics much more interesting than paintings. But I must ask: why would ANYONE travel to a foreign country just to pick up the first hot guy they see and follow a rock band around and go to parties and do other things they could just do at home? Oh yeah, ditzy teenagers.Well, lo and behold, the daughter gets kidnapped, just like the father feared. And she happened to be on the phone with her father at the time. How lucky that he could record the incident! The movie wasn't bad up until this point but shortly afterward all the unbelievable things started to happen. Suspension of disbelief is one thing. But the guy was a former spy, not Superman.*SPOILER ALERT*The father goes to two different places where they are holding girls to turn into sex slaves. Naturally his daughter is not in either. He kills everyone he comes across and never gets one little scratch. Then he starts attacking everyone in his path just to get by them. He shoots this one guy's innocent wife just to get him to talk. He goes on this crazy car chase down the wrong side of the highway. Yeah, risk the lives of another innocent 50 people just to save one. Sorry, that's just wrong. Finally he finds his daughter. She wasn't at the other places because she was one of the special ones who was being sold to an individual buyer. Not just that, but they were ""saving the best for last."" Gee, what are the odds? Why, exactly? Well, she's American, and speaks English and French. Come on, she wasn't even that pretty. I think he didn't find her until the third place he looked because they needed to make the movie longer. Anyway, they capture the father. But even with his hands tied up, he manages to kill another ten bad guys. Yep, a Superman. So a little more drama, and then they come home, and all of a sudden he has his arm in a cast, even though he killed like 60 people without ever getting a scratch. This could have been a much more interesting story, if only it had been better executed.

Thank goodness I ignored what most of the naysayers had to write about this one.  I found it highly entertaining, fast paced, and in its own weird way, a sweet story.  The people that say the daughter is a brat, I don't know where they got that from.  She is a naive, slightly goofy 17 year old who at the last minute realizes she got herself in some deep trouble.  She treats her dad (Liam) with respect, and yes, her dad is protective and a bit behind the times, but he is exactly what a dad should be.And about the violence and body count.  Yep, Liam kills some people.  But each of his 'victims' was tied into the sex slavery business and knew exactly what was going on.  Plus, most were trying to kill him too.  The bad guys didn't mind killing innocent ones, so  they shouldn't have been surprised when their time came.Some complained about the pipe scene and the shooting of a wife (I don't wanna give too much info away), but if you actually watch the movie, listen to the dialogue, those scenes made sense and worked fine.  Sure, if you missed a few lines of dialogue about why the woman got a flesh wound, then it would seem a bit harsh.I watched this with my teenager, yeah, it was chancy I guess, but she enjoyed it and wants to see more adventure movies.  It had a few bits of dialogue she didn't need to hear, but was otherwise pretty clean, except some blood here and there.  This did not bore us like Mall Cop and Bedtime Stories.

1194446,A2FOB8EWQ2ZHXX,B001GCUNYO,Jason Brown,"[24, 80]","THE MOVIE:Watch Man On Fire or The Brave One instead. This is a sad, sad attempt to capitalize on the revenge movie genre. At no point can this movie ever be taken seriously. The dialogue is laughably convenient with the subtlety of a sledge hammer. Neeson's character is comically professional at what he does; remaining perfectly stone-faced and professional as his daughter is abducted and kidnapped. His character is beyond ridiculous and everything he says or does is utterly hilarious.The beginning of the movie is exceptionally artificial and transparent because every scene is so clearly an excuse to bluntly tell you something about his character. NONE of it feels natural, which is okay on a certain level but the movie tries to take itself seriously and that's where it all falls apart.The acting is pretty bad overall, despite many of the actors being very good in other movies. This is a sign of bad directing and bad editing. This is likely because the director's previous movie was District B-13; an enjoyable action movie that is very short and in which 2/3 of movie is action. The problem comes when this director tries to make an action movie with drama and everything falls apart.The most important ingredient to a revenge movie is motivation and the movie just has none. Despite its many attempts to establish characters, I never felt anything for anyone, least of all the daughter. The only thing we have to go on is that they tell us the girl's his daughter and some nights he sits looking at childhood photos of her. There's no reason to care about her, especially when she blows off her father's heartfelt gift because her rich stepdaddy bought her a pony. That's right, a pony. Could it get anymore cliche?Seeing a shallow, 60-year-old man brutally beat up and shoot countless people, only made worse by the juvenile directing and editing, was the source of immense hilarity to my friends and I. I don't know why Neeson doesn't turn and wink at the camera spouting off lines like ""[I'd sacrifice everything for her]"", ""[I'll tear down the Eifel Tower if I have to"", and ""[I could follow you across Europe. I'm very good at not being seen]."" Neeson's attempt at the [Batman voice] was also hilarious; ""WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER!"" He's way above this material but even his acting is crap.There's 0 drama in this despite the constant attempts to force it down your throat. In my mind, I cannot imagine anyone taking this movie seriously. It really is an unintentional parody of the highest calibur right up there with Wanted. I also can't believe this movie was written by Luc Besson. He has made excellent action films like Leon: The Professional, The Fifth Element, and Unleashed. It seems like a 12-year-old wrote this. Then again, he was involved in the Transporter movies and those are meh but at least they DON'T TAKE THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY.Also, pretty much every time someone dies in the movie it's so poorly handled that it's to the point of parody. The shots he uses and the context of many of these are hilarious. Like a truck coming out of nowhere and running over someone, or showing a guy look through a port hole only to have Neeson pop into frame quickly and shoot the guy in the face through the port hole. Or the part that takes the cake is when Neeson quickly stands up and shoots an innocent woman in the arm... FOR NO REASON! Maybe in another context many of these things could have felt more natural, shocking, or interesting but it's all so hilarious here. I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater because I would have likely been kicked out for laughing so hard.It's a terrible movie overall, but an excellent choice for a comedy rental but no one should ever own this trash.THE BLU-RAY:Picture quality and audio seemed very good.

He's hesitant in the first place, denying her initial request; however, he eventually relents but with a few requirements.  Kim gets a cell phone and must stay in constant contact with her father.  Off she goes to Europe away from daddy's protection.  Within a single day, but not too quickly, his daughter calls her father.  While on the phone she sees her friend get kidnapped, and her father lets her know she is also going to be taken.  Dad is not pleased, informs the bad guy as much, and the bad guy's reply, ""Good luck.""  The hunt is on.Make no mistake about it, get in Bryan's way and you'll be punished.  If he has time, and you pose a particularly burdensome obstacle, you may even die.  For the most part he drops various bad guys with single head shots.  Other than Captain Kirk's infamous neck chop, there has not been such one-punch precision in the history of combat.  Every criminal element involved is essentially a punching bag, rag doll waiting for the coup de grace.Will he get to his daughter in time?  The power of this movie is the suspense, not knowing if he'll make it in time to save Kim from danger, or if he'll find her at all.  Great action movie, something that goes from zero to sixty in no time at all, and never takes pressure off the throttle.",5,Good luck.,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,1826,"['setup', 'concept', 'execution', 'brilliant', 'Even', 'trailer', 'made', 'not', 'apologies', 'type', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Someone', 'Bryan', 'Neeson', 'little', 'girl', 'Kim', 'Grace', ""n't"", 'realize', 'very', 'dangerous', 'man', 'capable', 'serious', 'damage', 'when', 'provoked', 'rest', 'movie', 'chase', 'find', 'Kim', 'where', 'Bryan', 'vast', 'array', 'skills', 'acquired', 'former', 'FBI', 'agent', 'track', 'down', 'evil', 'criminals', 'involved', 'abduction.Before', 'allowing', 'Kim', 'go', 'vacation', 'Paris', 'friend', 'Bryan', 'precaution', 'hesitant', 'first', 'place', 'denying', 'initial', 'request', 'however', 'eventually', 'few', 'requirements', 'Kim', 'cell', 'phone', 'must', 'stay', 'constant', 'contact', 'father', 'Europe', 'away', 'daddy', 'protection', 'single', 'day', 'not', 'too', 'quickly', 'daughter', 'father', 'phone', 'friend', 'get', 'kidnapped', 'father', 'know', 'also', 'going', 'be', 'taken', 'Dad', 'not', 'pleased', 'bad', 'guy', 'much', 'bad', 'guy', 'reply', 'Good', 'luck', 'hunt', 'on.Make', 'mistake', 'get', 'Bryan', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'punished', 'time', 'pose', 'particularly', 'burdensome', 'obstacle', 'may', 'even', 'die', 'most', 'part', 'various', 'bad', 'guys', 'single', 'head', 'shots', 'Other', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'infamous', 'neck', 'chop', 'not', 'been', 'such', 'one-punch', 'precision', 'history', 'combat', 'criminal', 'element', 'involved', 'essentially', 'punching', 'bag', 'rag', 'doll', 'waiting', 'coup', 'de', 'grace.Will', 'get', 'daughter', 'time', 'power', 'movie', 'suspense', 'not', 'knowing', ""'ll"", 'make', 'time', 'save', 'Kim', 'danger', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Great', 'action', 'movie', 'something', 'zero', 'sixty', 'time', 'never', 'pressure', 'throttle']",Taken

It is basically senseless action, but without 99% of the [...] that makes a Van Damme film so horrible, and regretable.Those types of movies have their use, so I don't mean to disrespect them too much.  Sometimes you want just a reckless revenge tale, without the cerebral stimulation, or good dialogue...or believeable situations.I want to point out that in the opening scenes of the movie --home video of the daughter opening gifts on her birthday-- the film's score plays two lines of music that sounds like a note-for-note rip off of Clint Mansell's score to The Fountain.  I don't know if Nathaniel Mechaly (Taken's composer) did this as an ode to Mansell or not, but it was so strikingly similar I paused the movie and brought up the final track on The Fountain's soundtrack: Together We Will Live Forever (the melody that appears about 51 seconds in) just to make sure.  I rewound and played the film's version again, then played The Fountain track. Identical. Taken's version is even in the same key!!So while the themes, plot points, motivations, and even the score of Taken are not original or unique, they take what a lot of horribly executed movies (Segal and Van Damme) try to do and Taken one-ups them.  The exception is the score of course.

He clearly regrets missing out on quality time with his little girl, and attempts to forge a closer bond with her when she deceives him into granting her permission to fly to Europe to tour museum's when its nothing more than a ruse to cover her desire to hop from one country to another seeing one concert after another.When his daughter fails to call him at the appointed time, he desperately tries to get in touch with her, and when he finally does, he discovers that she is moments away from being abducted. He fights back the urge to fall apart and gives her some valuable advice and sets out to find and then punish those responsible.What an adrenaline RUSH.

Following path of revenge Besson takes us on a ride that is full of action and the whole story is told in beautiful simplicity. It doesn't present nothing new, but the way the whole movie was filmed, with amazing action scenes (some of them brutal like electricity torture) and great actor in main role, you gotta' be satisfied with final outcome. The film takes many turns and even goes on the verge of moral ambiguity but Neeson's charisma pulls the film through even its more preposterous segments.And yes, you know that he's going to save everyone but then again Seagal also saves everyone but 95% of his movies are sort of dense.

Well, there are only a couple of shots of Paris, and none worth a second glance -- that's all you get is a glance at anything, as the movie never stops rushing from one place to antoher, pausing only long enough for Neeson to dispose of an enemy in a few quick cuts.  There's no dialog worth mentioning in the entire movie, and the only subplot (with his French friend as part of the crime ring) so overused in detective/action movies it's blase now.  Liam Neeson's acting cannot overcome poor plot, poor dialog, poor filming, poor costuming, poor editing, and poor acting on every one else's part (his 17 year old daughter acts like she's six years old, even Famke Janssen is flat as his ex-wife).  The reason this is only an hour and a half is because of the total lack of content.

1194465,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B001GCUNYO,J from NY,"[0, 0]","Liam Neeson does an unexpected about face from his usual touchy feely roles and makes an inhuman turn for the best in this ultraviolent yet strangely touching action film.Brian Mills is an ex-CIA agent/ex-Marine/ex everything, I guess, who has spent most of his life doing very undercover dangerous James Bond things.  At the beginning we see a lonely man who, to all outward appearances, seems very gentle and attempting to make up for lost time with his gorgeous daughter, Kim.  Having spent his life dealing with dangerous people and preventing ""bad things"" (where was Brian Mills on before 9/11? Couldn't a guy like this grab Osama Bin Laden in five seconds?)Anyway, against his advice, his daughter goes to Paris with a few of her friends.  Brian is concerned because he is aware that there are people who are into selling young girls into a slave trade for high class criminals.  And, of course, his daughter gets kidnapped.Neeson does a superb job of turning within the course of about fifteen seconds from a concerned father into a walking, barking, unstoppable killing machine.  The reason the film is believable is because of Neeson's blank facial expression, his ability to switch off his emotions in a deadly second, and his ruthlessness.  Whoever trained the actor in whatever martial art/self defense skills did a good job.  And Mills is no angel.  There are scenes in which he way too far.  There is nothing sentimental about it.  He wants his daughter and nothing going to stop him unless it's a very well placed bullet.Though some of this might strike the viewer as a bit far fetched, it is Liam Neeson's performance that makes it worth watching.

It might keep you from making a worse than stupid mistake.No, I'm not a paranoid freak, but I have traveled a good part of this globe and seen things. A couple of summers ago, I spent some time in Italy. I was amazed at the blatant stupidity so many American kids under the age of 25, exhibit. I don't know if it's because they've seen a gazillion teen movies where the thing to do is go abroad and get laid or what. But I saw teen girls hanging out of their hotel room windows, accosting men passing beneath their window. They were looking for a good time with a cute Italian boy.So, is Taken an accurate portrait of what can happen to naive, unsuspecting young women? Well, let's just say it may not happen every day (I hope), but it happens. Unfortunately, when it happens, (SPOILER ALERT) I don't think the young women are ever rescued the way the girl is rescued in this film.This isn't just a non-stop action film, it has emotional depth, portrayed subtly, yet effectively, by Liam Neeson's craggy features. His daughter is his whole life. He's lost everything else, and he knows it. And he knows why. He's determined to solidify the bonds with his nearly-grown daughter. His devotion is shown in the way he carefully selects her birthday present. With careful attention to detail, he wraps the present himself. With every strip of tape he tears, he's pouring his love into the wrapping of a present that's modest compared to the expensive gifts given by his wife's wealthy husband. He hangs in there which is sometimes the hardest thing for a man to do when his wife and child have moved on. Most men write it off and move on also.Taken is an action thriller, but it's also the portrait of a man who will do whatever it takes to save his child. Though most of us don't have the Jack Bauer-skills, as possessed by the character in this film, that willingness to protect our children is something we all identify with. That's the universal truth that makes the film work, and that's why there's emotional resonance in Taken.The film is written by Luc Besson; known for the La Femme Nikita franchise, The Fifth Element, and The Transporter franchise; and Robert Mark Kamen; known for Taps, The Karate Kid franchise, Gladiator, and A Walk in the Clouds as well as The Fifth Element and The Transporter franchise. The two work in what I call the uncommon hero action thriller.All of Besson's heroes are men of adventure now doing prosaic jobs. In Fifth Element starring Bruce Willis, the hero was driving a cab. In Transporter, the hero, once a Ranger, was a driver who transported whatever. In Taken, the hero is a retired spy/black ops/whatever who's working security gigs. He uses his old skills to save his daughter who is being forced into the sex/slave trade.I suspect Kamen brings the emotional resonance to the partnership. His previous works are emotionally charged conflicts. In Taps, the hero is tortured by the demands of honor and obedience. In Karate Kid, the hero is young and untried and faced with standing up to bullies despite the consequences. In A Walk in the Clouds, the hero, played superbly by Keanu Reeves, is offering his protection to and falling in love with, a young woman, pregnant out of wedlock in the 1940's.Universal truth is the difference between a good flick and a great one that will be remembered.

So with this information and a ticking clock off Mills goes.After the first 30-35 minutes, the film is mainly one action sequence after another as Mills' search for his daughter takes him all over Paris and other parts of France, I'm guessing at least since a lot of loactions were never fully specified.There's a really cool chase scene throughout a construction site where some men are holding some of the girls. Almost every action portion involves Mills using skills he learned over the years (basically how to kill) to get information and take down people to get his daughter back.The action is great, fast paced and of course mostly ridiculous. The rest of the cast is made up of mostly throwaway characters and stereotypical bad guys, though Famke Janssen has a small role as Mills ex-wife and of course is Kim's mother.Personally as silly and goofy as the film can be and is, it's a ton of fun and flies by quickly though given the 85 minutes running time it's not suprising.

His daughter, played by Maggie Grace (Lost seaons one and two) goes to Paris with her friend, all with Mills' reluctant permission.  Mills then goes into hyper drive working to find his daughter, reaping vengeance along the way.Neeson is very strong and the mood of his intensity is set from the beginning.  He has friends who he was worked with in the past that give us a view of what he was like before he retired to be close to his daughter who lives with ex-wife (Janssen).  The movie helps us to appreciate Mills who after years of neglect, feels a need to be there for his kid.The movie takes us to Los Angeles and to Paris.  There are some very interesting chase sequences, one in a construction site at night, interesting sensation for sure.  There are a few intense fights that are seemingly unrealistic, however, who cares, he is trying to save his daughter.Each encounter with the bad guys gets more and more intense.  The movie crescendos at last with a fight scene on a yacht.  Better than any James Bond type of view, and very interesting indeed.

1194490,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B001GCUNYO,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[1, 5]","First of all it's a compelling action flick, albeit ridiculously unrealistic.  This movie portrays Dad as the Super-Hero to his daughter:  he's all-knowing, all-powerful, completely bullet-proof and one who beats the crap out of her many kidnappers.  I get the feeling that the Hollywood industry is chock full of divorced Dads who feel like failures to their children, and this movie is kind of an over-the-top fantasy to compensate.  OR the producers are targeting this film to middle-age Dads who feel inadequate, and/or the children who fantasize about having an all-powerfull protective father.  At any rate, this action fantasy certainly hits the psychological mark for the intended audience.  Liam Neeson is a perfect selection to portray the 50ish former CIA action guy who rescues his daughter from a ring of Albanian kidnappers and traffickers in young prostitutes, in France.  He's smart as well as tough, basically is invincible, beats up any number of pathetic bad guys, shoots a bunch more like Rambo, and doesn't get a scratch.  But, really, there's too much of this psychological ""Father Figure Worship"" going on here.  Even how the movie starts out, with Neesom hired to be a bodyguard to some cute young female pop singer.  She gives him attitude (""the Old Guy"" syndrome), then he saves her from a psychopathic fan, and of course she worships him.  What older guy wouldn't want to be idolized by a young, famous, attractive female?  So it starts out a little bit cheesy in that respect.  But this initial episode is just a forerunner to the real action when SUPERMAN DAD starts kicking Bad-guy butt!The plot then moves on to the worldly, divorced Dad telling his 18-19YO girl (on a trip to France OK'ed by her Mother, travelling with a stupid partying friend) to be careful.  Under the influence from her dumb (and doomed) friend, she's not, and they get taken virtually seconds after they get off the plane.  A truly compelling scene is when she calls Dad (who's living in the US) on the cell from Paris, hiding under the bed as the Albanians enter their apartment, and then you hear a scream, a commotion, and some thug with a thick accent taunts Dad over the phone (this will come back to haunt the thug!).  As the cliche goes, it's ""Every Parent's Worst Nightmare!""Superman Dad springs into action and tracks her down with a number of ingeneous moves, getting himself targeted by the French police in the process.  So Neeson's character has to track her trail through all of Paris while beating and killing many bad guys in the process, all the while avoiding the French police.  I.e. typical Hollywood super-spy stuff.  It REALLY taps into one's psyche: if YOUR daughter were kidnapped, could you save her with such ruthless and efficient aplomb?  Not a chance!  But our hero Liam Neeson can!  It is a good ride if you totally suspend your disbelief.Now let's compare to REALITY for a second: the ultra-dangerous world South of our border where Mexico is now rated the WORST country in the world for kidnapping!  Literally hundreds of people a year get taken there, and how many of them get saved by their parents or even by the Law??  Not many.  Even Americans are getting kidnapped, because the cartels know that they can squeeze their family for $$$ before they kill them.

It had an admittedly rocky start with Liam Neeson is trying to reconnect with his virginal 17 year-old teenage daughter in a way that seems just on this side of creepy. (Dude get your own girlfriend... really)Speaking of which; swarthy bad guys, who clearly have never heard of Nancy Grace, are kidnapping Rich American Girls and making them drugged out street walkers or selling them for millions to Arab Sheiks based on whether they are virgins or not.So ex-CIA estranged father Liam Neeson has 96 hours to find his daughter before she is 'gone forever' deflowered and then burkaized apparently. 'A Fate Worse than Death' you can almost hear the characters thinking.It's as if Charles Bronson was guest starring in an Ilsa the Wicked Warden film located in George C Scott's Hardcore and the entire enterprise was PG-13. And yet the film still works two thirds through. Liam Neeson is more than fine. He is kicking ass on all cylinders. It's the bad guys that drop the ball.First a rich French guy starts quoting the Godfather. 'It's not personal it's business' For starters the quote isn't even in context. He might as well have told the gun toting Liam Neeson 'may the force be with you' for all the sense it makes. Second of all you can't quote the Godfather without referencing the fact that you are quoting it in the first place. Any screenwriter who does that should be sleeping with the fishes.The second slap to the head is an Arab Sheik character that looked like he stepped out of a 1940's Bugs Bunny cartoon. Honestly I don't know where to begin on this silly stereotype. Why is he the film? Why does he have a knife to the white virgin's throat? Who would Oscar Schindler shoot????The last point seems important since the Arab is basically a Juden in a dress. Same large noses, same aversion to pork, same living in ghettos in Europe (Or/and having all the money), same secret organizations paying off French politicians, same affinity to despoiling white Aryan virgins... The more things change the more the stay the same I guess. (They didn't have the Arab cook and eat a baby. I guess they are holding that back for the sequel)Overt French xenophobia aside, Taken is a fun ride for most of the trip.

1194495,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001GCUNYO,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[5, 6]","Who would have ever thought that Hollywood would attempt to include an important topic to serve as the basis for one of its typically generic, yet entertaining action films? Generally these films are created to provide mindless escapism along with a hefty dose of guns and fist-fights, or just to be another brainless vehicle showcasing the action star of the moment. In the case of ""Taken"", a much more serious topic, the trafficking of women, serves as the catalyst for all the mayhem that ensues over the course of the film.""Taken"" is the story of a young girl named Kim (Maggie Grace), who takes a trip to France with a friend for the summer; however, what should have been a trip filled with good times and fond memories, turns horribly wrong when they are kidnapped for the sole purpose of being sold into a dark underworld of sex and drugs. What the kidnappers didn't count on was that Kim's father, Bryan (Liam Neeson), is a man of rather ""special"" talents that he learned during his time spent working as a spy for the United States government. With his daughter's life in jeopardy, Bryan must call upon every deadly skill he's ever learned to track down those responsible and save his daughter before it's too late.Filmmaker and writer Luc Besson (""Transporter"" series) has made a career out of delivering to audiences bone crushing, overly stylized and over-the-top action movies that entertain us, but don't really give us anything new in terms of story or emotional range. With ""Taken"" Luc Besson, along with co-writer Robert Mark Kamen (""Transporter 2""), imbues the story with a much more serious, emotionally charged backbone. The seedy underworld of kidnapping and trafficking women for sex is one that exists without a whole lot of attention being called to it, thus making this film's message all the more important. The story is wisely written in such a way that it gives us just enough of a glimpse into this world that we become more enlightened as too some of the new threats out there, but not so graphic that the film is too shocking for most people to see. By handling the subject matter in this somewhat delicate manner, some would say it just glossed over the evil done in this so-called ""business"", but the message is able to reach a much broader spectrum of people than a harder edged movie would have been able to. For those feeling that the film didn't do enough to expose the despicable nature of this world, I do agree, but I understand why it was a better decision not to go too far with it. Because to go too hard and gritty with this movie by being too explicit, you run the risk of limiting and/or alienating your audience, which is not something you want when dealing with such a serious topic.Even with the much heftier subject matter, ""Taken"" still could have run the risk of being just a slightly above average action movie if not for the considerable talents of star Liam Neeson. Liam brings to the character of Bryan a gentleness and an obvious love for his daughter in the early portion of the movie, so that when the rubber really hits the road, the actions he takes to find her, and the ferocity in which he acts is completely believable. Regardless of how brutal Bryan may act towards these undeniably deserving adversaries, he never becomes inaccessible to the audience. This is because Liam's gravitas and at times emotional performance keeps the audience invested in his character and his mission. Sometimes in an action movie, the action can become too front and center that the how's and why's of the story (no matter how important and central they may be to the action) get forgotten about until the very end when they are conveniently re-introduced to the audience as a reminder. For ""Taken"" this is not the case, as Bryan's love for his daughter and unwillingness to give up on finding her always remains front and center, even during the action sequences.Other members of the cast included Famke Janssen (""X-Men"" trilogy), Maggie Grace (""The Fog""), and Leland Orser (""The Bone Collector""). Each of these supporting actors and actresses do a good job with the little time they do receive onscreen. Primarily this movie belongs solely to Liam Neeson, while the supporting roles are nothing more than glorified cameos, which suits this type of film perfectly. Out of the supporting cast, Maggie Grace probably gives the best performance, because had it not been for her emotional connection with Liam in the film's early scenes, the audience wouldn't have been able to connect with him as much later on. Sure, the story would have still impacted us in some way, but by having their relationship feel so realistic, it made our connection to him throughout the remainder of the film all the more palpable.Lastly, first time director Pierre Morel brings his keen eye for action to the proceedings with great effectiveness. Pierre's work as Director of Cinematography on the action film ""War"", starring Jet Li and Jason Statham, clearly served as great preparation for his work on this film. While I didn't enjoy the aforementioned film all that much, the action scenes were handled very well, much the same way as they are here. Unlike many of writer Luc Besson's action films, ""Taken"" contains none of his trademark over-the-top, overblown action sequences that while incredibly fun to watch, are completely unbelievable. Instead, Pierre opts to keep the action realistic and up-close and personal, while still providing plenty of hard-hitting, fast-paced (somewhat stylized) fight sequences, that don't really feel all that unbelievable or obviously choreographed.""Taken"" is a great action film that offers plenty of violence for the action junkies, while at the same time providing some solid acting, and a story that shines a light on a dark world that needs to be exposed and put to an end.""Taken"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.",5,There's No Stopping A Father On A

At each turn it seems the world of Human Slavery and underworld prostituion becomes more evil and dark. For anyone who is a ""Dad"", you want to cheer Nelson on to just ""kick-the-crap"" out of every single one of them which he gladly does.The film is visually solid with a nice DTS track to it. The fight scenes (which are plenty of) actually does produce some nice low end along with some gun battles. It's not say Rambo sound but the hand-to-hand combat scenes really do sound and look good. I'm giving it 4 of 5 Stars but on a scale of 1 to 10 it would be a 8.8.

1194503,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B001GCUNYO,Kathy W,"[2, 2]","Saw this one in the movies and what a great movie!  Granted, this is sensitive subject matter, something that you have been hearing about repeatedly in movies and television specials over the last couple of years.  This movie is about human trafficking--in other words, stealing young girls, rendering them helpless with drugs, and then selling them into prostitution to the highest bidder, usually in a foreign country.With that said, Bryan (Neeson) and former wife Lenore are divorced.  Lenore has remarried a rich businessman.  Bryan and Lenore's daughter Kim is now 17 and lives with Lenore.  Bryan sees Kim when he wants but Lenore is kind of icy toward him, still apparently blaming him for the years he wasn't there for mother and daughter.  As a now retired CIA field operative (apparently well thought of and quite proficient in his job), Bryan wants to get to know his little girl better now.  The movie begins as he reminisces about Kim's 5th birthday and subsequently takes a present to her 17th birthday party at the mansion.In the very beginning, Bryan helps a few of his CIA buddies with a side job as a bodyguard to a singer at a concert and befriends her when he saves her life.  You see Bryan's well choreographed protective moves as he puts down the offender and your confidence level in Bryan's abilities soar.  The singer offers to help Kim get a start singing (if she is as good as Bryan says).  Excited to tell Kim, Bryan is mentally slapped in the face when he finds that Kim wants to meet with him over lunch only to get his signed permission to go to Europe with her girlfriend.  Reluctantly, he agrees to sign and off she goes, with conditions to check in daily on the cell phone Bryan gives her.No sooner does the plane land in Paris, than the girls are greeted by a 2-legged snake who is part of an Albanian trafficking ring.  Peter offers to share a taxi with them (to split the expense).  Finding out where they live, he is able to contact the thugs who show up to grab them.  Kim is talking to her father on the cell when she sees the bad guys grab her girlfriend from a window and it is a chilling moment when Bryan says ""You will be taken"" and to leave the cell phone on.  A few moments later, my heart sank as they grabbed Kim, screaming and thrashing and drug her from under the bed.  Bryan tells the kidnappers to turn her loose and he won't kill them.  Of course, the ego-driven, invincible bad guys tell him something similar to ""good luck"". Well, the Albanians just unleashed their worst nightmare! Bryan, with all his training and skills in tact, is quickly on a plane to Paris on a hell-bent mission to get Kim back, no-holds barred.This is a kick-butt movie, full of intense action, stunts, car-chases, and killing.  While I'm not normally big on watching people get killed, I have to admit, the bad guys and their crimes were so despicable that I did enjoy seeing them get taken out, one by one.  There is edge-of-your-seat action as Bryan hunts down the bad guys one by one and weaves his way through the network of filth to try to find his little girl.Although extremely unlikely that he would have ever found her, it was a great movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Considering the subject matter, it was done fairly tastefully, too.From what I remember, you did not actually see the sexual acts or the girls getting drugged.  A lot of people do get shot and someone does get tortured to find out needed information.Quite possibly, more of our teenagers need to be sensitized to the facts that these things do happen.  Although no one should live in fear, young women do need to exercise sufficient caution about where they go and who they go with. I hope this film will both entertain and educate our young people.",5,Human Trafficking,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,3761,"['Saw', 'one', 'movies', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'Granted', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter', 'something', 'have', 'been', 'hearing', 'repeatedly', 'movies', 'television', 'specials', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'movie', 'human', 'trafficking', 'other', 'words', 'stealing', 'young', 'girls', 'rendering', 'helpless', 'drugs', 'then', 'selling', 'prostitution', 'highest', 'bidder', 'usually', 'foreign', 'country.With', 'said', 'Bryan', 'Neeson', 'former', 'wife', 'Lenore', 'are', 'divorced', 'Lenore', 'remarried', 'rich', 'businessman', 'Bryan', 'Lenore', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'now', '17', 'lives', 'Lenore', 'Bryan', 'Kim', 'when', 'Lenore', 'kind', 'icy', 'still', 'apparently', 'blaming', 'years', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'mother', 'daughter', 'now', 'retired', 'CIA', 'field', 'operative', 'apparently', 'well', 'thought', 'quite', 'proficient', 'job', 'Bryan', 'get', 'know', 'little', 'girl', 'better', 'now', 'movie', 'Kim', '5th', 'birthday', 'subsequently', 'present', '17th', 'birthday', 'party', 'mansion.In', 'very', 'beginning', 'Bryan', 'few', 'CIA', 'buddies', 'side', 'job', 'bodyguard', 'singer', 'concert', 'when', 'life', 'see', 'Bryan', 'well', 'choreographed', 'protective', 'moves', 'down', 'offender', 'confidence', 'level', 'Bryan', 'abilities', 'soar', 'singer', 'help', 'Kim', 'get', 'start', 'singing', 'as', 'good', 'Bryan', 'Excited', 'tell', 'Kim', 'Bryan', 'mentally', 'slapped', 'face', 'when', 'Kim', 'meet', 'over', 'lunch', 'only', 'get', 'signed', 'permission', 'go', 'Europe', 'girlfriend', 'Reluctantly', 'sign', 'conditions', 'check', 'daily', 'cell', 'phone', 'Bryan', 'her.No', 'sooner', 'plane', 'land', 'Paris', 'girls', 'are', 'greeted', '2-legged', 'snake', 'who', 'part', 'Albanian', 'trafficking', 'ring', 'Peter', 'share', 'taxi', 'split', 'expense', 'Finding', 'out', 'where', 'live', 'able', 'contact', 'thugs', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'grab', 'Kim', 'talking', 'father', 'cell', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'grab', 'girlfriend', 'window', 'chilling', 'moment', 'when', 'Bryan', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'leave', 'cell', 'phone', 'few', 'moments', 'later', 'heart', 'sank', 'grabbed', 'Kim', 'screaming', 'thrashing', 'drug', 'bed', 'Bryan', 'kidnappers', 'turn', 'loose', 'wo', ""n't"", 'kill', 'course', 'ego-driven', 'invincible', 'bad', 'guys', 'tell', 'something', 'similar', 'good', 'luck', 'Well', 'Albanians', 'just', 'unleashed', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'Bryan', 'training', 'skills', 'tact', 'quickly', 'plane', 'Paris', 'hell-bent', 'mission', 'get', 'Kim', 'back', 'no-holds', 'barred.This', 'kick-butt', 'movie', 'full', 'intense', 'action', 'stunts', 'car-chases', 'killing', ""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'big', 'watching', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'have', 'admit', 'bad', 'guys', 'crimes', 'were', 'so', 'despicable', 'did', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'get', 'taken', 'out', 'one', 'one', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'action', 'Bryan', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'one', 'one', 'way', 'network', 'filth', 'try', 'find', 'little', 'girl.Although', 'extremely', 'unlikely', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'found', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'done', 'fairly', 'tastefully', 'what', 'remember', 'did', 'not', 'actually', 'see', 'sexual', 'acts', 'girls', 'getting', 'drugged', 'lot', 'people', 'do', 'get', 'shot', 'someone', 'get', 'tortured', 'find', 'out', 'needed', 'information.Quite', 'possibly', 'more', 'teenagers', 'need', 'be', 'sensitized', 'facts', 'things', 'do', 'happen', 'one', 'should', 'live', 'fear', 'young', 'women', 'do', 'need', 'exercise', 'sufficient', 'caution', 'where', 'go', 'who', 'go', 'hope', 'film', 'will', 'both', 'entertain', 'educate', 'young', 'people']",Taken

There are not that many movies out there anymore that makes the father out to be the HeRo like this movie does.Short storyline: Former CIA Agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) daughter,Maggie, goes on a trip out of the country to Paris with her friend only to get kidnapped by a group of men who ""sells"" (traffics) them to the highest bidder. Mills has to use every skill that he knows to find out who these men are, find out where they live, and stop them before his daughter gets hurt.

If you haven't seen any of those, buy them and not this.  However, this film held my attention and it was great to see a big sensitive actor like Liam carrying such a dark brutal story.  The action is just a bit too unrealistic.  We see Liam beating up five guys at once who are all half his age, but we never see him pause to catch his breath once.

This is how the story goes: Former government operative Bryan Mills begins the longest 96-hours of his life--and the hunt for the fearsome organization that has taken his daughter Kim. Mills had only recently given up his government career as what he calls a 'preventer' to be near Kim, who lives with Bryan's ex-wife Lenore and her new husband. To make ends meet, Bryan joins some former colleagues for special security details (like guarding a pop diva), but most of his time and energy are spent re-connecting with Kim. Bryan's familial goal is nearly derailed when Kim requests his permission to spend time in Paris with a friend. All too aware of the dangers that could lie ahead for Kim in a foreign land, Bryan says no, but Kim's disappointment leads him to very reluctantly relent. Bryan's worst fears are realized when Kim and her friend Amanda are suddenly abducted--in broad daylight--from the Paris apartment at which they've just arrived. Moments before Kim is dragged away by the as yet unseen and unknown assailants, she manages to phone Bryan, who begins to expertly piece together clues that will take him to the darkness of Paris' underworld, and to the City of Lights' plushest mansions. He will face nightmares worse than anything he experienced in black ops--and let nothing and no one stop him from saving his daughter.The cast led by Liam Neeson (as Bryan) is great!

1194521,AR3HV5WH2I4B2,B001GCUNYO,"Kristopher KR ""Um, yeah.""","[3, 5]","First of all, when one thinks of a big action star, they tend to have names like Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the such spring to mind.  Then there's the typically quiet and reserved, yet strong character that Liam Neeson plays in so many films. (Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition))(Nell.)Every once in a while, however, a story and script come along which gives the likes of the powerful gravitas Neeson brings to the screen which allows him to kick some serious BUTT.  ""TAKEN"" is such a film.From the get go, we get a few things thrown at us about this great man, loving father.  He's meticulous, he adores his daughter (even though he and his wife split long ago and she now lives with his ex and her new multi-millionaire husband.)  We also learn soon that he has a very unique past wherein he's a retired spy.  And throughout the course of the film, we find out that he's a very WELL-trained former spy.This movie is easily one of the types that normally last around 2 hours plus. One beautiful thing about this film is the fact that it doesn't go too deep into the characters backstory.  We don't know what the true reason was for the breakdown of the marriage, how did the ex-wife get with the millionaire? What group of spys did Bryan Mills (Neeson's character) work for, etc.The point is, we as the audience don't HAVE to know all this stuff.  The movie is just there to let us enjoy the white knuckle ride we're about to strap ourselves in for.Near the beginning of the action, Neeson's daughter, played brilliantly by Maggie Grace (Lost: The Complete Fifth Season) tricks her father to letting her go overseas.  He, being the concerned and wise father is quite leary about what she's up to and her safety (any parent.)  As it turns out, shortly after her and her friend land in Paris for a visit, they are kidnapped while she's talking to him on the phone. (By the way, this information is in the trailer, so no real spoilers if you're concerned.)From the moment the daughter (Kim) drops the phone and the kidnappers pick it up, the tension is sky high.  We all know Neeson is a force, a hurricane covering a typhooon with tornados embedded in his rage to find out who has taken his daughter.Using his skills and knowhow, he travels overseas to find his daughter and the ones who took her (and her friend Amanda.)Action packed is an understatement for this full throtle movie!  There's so much great about this flick, it may soon be in my top five favorites with the more viewings I give it.The emotion seen in Neeson's eyes, the subtle nuances and grimaces that he flairs upon his face speak volumes about what is going on inside his head, how the cogs of his brain are working non stop on plans A, B, C, D and beyond for his next steps.  Nothing, and I mean NOTHING will stand in his way to getting his daughter back.The cast, as I said, is brilliant.  The script may have had a plot hole or two.  But more or less it's the type(s) which make you just shrug it off and say: ""Ack! it's just a movie!"" (the ACK is very important when making the aforementioned statement.)To enhance the nailbiting action, the use of violin music (or maybe cello) really gets the heart pumping, the legs jumping and the fists clenching.Then, on to the editing and sound.  Usually these are two categories which get overlooked by the general public.  However, in ""TAKEN,"" it's quite important and quite frankly very hard to miss.  Those punches, thos chops to the neck, the grueling torture is nothing short of awesome.Needless to say, I loved this movie.  If you like action without a terrible amount of bloodshed (I watched the unrated version so I'm sure there was more in that version) and if you like a non-stop thrill ride that only lasts roughly 90 minutes, then ""TAKEN"" is certainly the movie for you.Check it out indeed!Watch, and enjoy!Thanks for reading :o)",5,TAKEN aback by how great this movie is!,1242345600,"05 15, 2009",2009,3874,"['First', 'all', 'when', 'one', 'big', 'action', 'star', 'tend', 'have', 'names', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'such', 'spring', 'mind', 'Then', 'typically', 'quiet', 'reserved', 'yet', 'strong', 'character', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Nell', 'once', 'while', 'however', 'story', 'script', 'come', 'likes', 'powerful', 'gravitas', 'Neeson', 'screen', 'kick', 'serious', 'BUTT', 'TAKEN', 'film.From', 'get', 'go', 'get', 'few', 'things', 'thrown', 'great', 'man', 'loving', 'father', 'meticulous', 'daughter', 'even', 'wife', 'split', 'long', 'ago', 'now', 'ex', 'new', 'multi-millionaire', 'husband', 'also', 'learn', 'soon', 'very', 'unique', 'past', 'wherein', 'retired', 'spy', 'course', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'very', 'WELL-trained', 'former', 'spy.This', 'movie', 'easily', 'one', 'types', 'normally', 'last', '2', 'hours', 'One', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'film', 'fact', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'deep', 'characters', 'backstory', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'true', 'reason', 'was', 'breakdown', 'marriage', 'how', 'did', 'ex-wife', 'get', 'millionaire', 'What', 'group', 'spys', 'did', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'Neeson', 'character', 'work', 'etc.The', 'point', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'HAVE', 'know', 'stuff', 'movie', 'just', 'there', 'let', 'enjoy', 'white', 'knuckle', 'ride', ""'re"", 'strap', 'for.Near', 'beginning', 'action', 'Neeson', 'daughter', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'Lost', 'Complete', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'father', 'letting', 'go', 'overseas', 'being', 'concerned', 'wise', 'father', 'quite', 'leary', 'what', 'up', 'safety', 'parent', 'out', 'shortly', 'friend', 'land', 'Paris', 'visit', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'talking', 'phone', 'way', 'information', 'trailer', 'real', 'spoilers', ""'re"", 'concerned', 'moment', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'phone', 'kidnappers', 'pick', 'up', 'tension', 'sky', 'high', 'know', 'Neeson', 'force', 'hurricane', 'covering', 'typhooon', 'tornados', 'embedded', 'rage', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'taken', 'daughter.Using', 'skills', 'knowhow', 'overseas', 'find', 'daughter', 'ones', 'who', 'took', 'friend', 'Amanda', 'Action', 'packed', 'understatement', 'full', 'throtle', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'great', 'flick', 'may', 'soon', 'be', 'top', 'five', 'favorites', 'more', 'viewings', 'give', 'it.The', 'emotion', 'seen', 'Neeson', 'eyes', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'grimaces', 'face', 'speak', 'volumes', 'what', 'going', 'head', 'how', 'cogs', 'brain', 'are', 'working', 'non', 'stop', 'plans', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'next', 'steps', 'Nothing', 'mean', 'NOTHING', 'will', 'stand', 'way', 'getting', 'daughter', 'back.The', 'cast', 'said', 'brilliant', 'script', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'plot', 'hole', 'two', 'more', 'less', 'type', 's', 'make', 'just', 'shrug', 'off', 'say', 'Ack', 'just', 'movie', 'ACK', 'very', 'important', 'when', 'making', 'aforementioned', 'statement', 'enhance', 'nailbiting', 'action', 'use', 'violin', 'music', 'maybe', 'cello', 'really', 'heart', 'pumping', 'legs', 'jumping', 'fists', 'clenching.Then', 'editing', 'sound', 'are', 'two', 'categories', 'get', 'overlooked', 'general', 'public', 'However', 'TAKEN', 'quite', 'important', 'quite', 'frankly', 'very', 'hard', 'miss', 'punches', 'thos', 'chops', 'neck', 'grueling', 'torture', 'nothing', 'short', 'awesome.Needless', 'say', 'loved', 'movie', 'like', 'action', 'terrible', 'amount', 'bloodshed', 'watched', 'unrated', 'version', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'more', 'version', 'like', 'non-stop', 'thrill', 'ride', 'only', 'roughly', '90', 'minutes', 'then', 'TAKEN', 'certainly', 'movie', 'you.Check', 'out', 'indeed', 'Watch', 'enjoy', 'Thanks', 'reading', 'o']",Taken

1194526,A2T049UQONS0OY,B001GCUNYO,Larry VanDeSande,"[1, 2]","One recent moment of great humor for me was watching 72-year-old Charles Bronson destroy bad guys and outrun automatic weapon fire during the fifth installment of his ever popular ""Death Wish"" series. That movie, made in 1994, was the end of the line for fans of that particular series. While Charles Bronson apparently wasn't available to play the lead here, ""Taken"" seems to have, ahem, taken up the mantle from ""Death Wish 5"" with ridiculous levels of action and heroism.If you've been living in a cave somewhere, the plot of ""Taken"" is Liam Neeson's 17-year-old daughter goes to France with her teenage friend -- over dad's objections -- and is almost immediately kidnapped. This happens while she's on the phone with dad, a former security expert, who ends up talking to her kidnapper and vowing revenge.Having apparently no financial worries, Neeson flies to Paris, almost immediately finds out who did the kidnapping, finds the guy and chases him to his death on a freeway ramp. This begins a lengthy discourse in ultra-violence and bloodletting rare even for this genre of film. You probably can figure out for yourself without seeing the movie the sequence of events and ending, so I won't bother with them. Suffice it to say the body count is high and the action plentiful.I found myself both involved in this movie and laughing through much of it. There is no indication the filmmakers were trying to create a parody and the leading man certainly does nothing to generate laughs.

Today's Europe is a far cry from the romantic picture that many Americans still imagine. Bad things can and do happen to naive teens arriving for an adventure.  Having visited France, the setting for Taken, several times in the past decade, I can say firsthand that this country has been inundated with emigres from eastern Europe, and not all of them are innocents in search of freedom. Organized crime has assumed a new face with new mobsters, and in some cases, the newcomers are more ruthless than the natives.The plot of  Taken centers upon a former CIA agent Bryan Mills, portrayed by Liam Neeson, whose daughter is off on a European jaunt, only to be victimized by Albanians eager to sell her virginal charms to the highest bidder.  Film maker Luc Besson, whose rep was made by  such action thrillers as  La Femme Nikita, ramps up the tension by having the abduction take place during a phone call from father to daughter, during which he coaches her to feed him vital info about the thugs. When one of them picks up the cellphone, Mills warns them to release his daughter or face his considerable, professional wrath. Of course, they blow off his warning. But two days later, he's onto them, and never, ever lets go.Neeson displays his physical side, literally mowing down anyone who stands in his way with an arsenal of awesome martial arts moves and laser-eyed shooting ability. Keep in mind that I normally abhor films with brutal scenes of torture and endless chase scenes. I've recently read a lot, however, about sex trafficking, and have to admit that I was rooting for Mills to turn up the electricity and take out those SOB's. Much of the action is totally implausible, but the crime is so heinous that I don't care. Neeson brings a knife edged, single minded, merciless sense of purpose to this role,  and while the daughter and her mother are mindless social twits, it's hard not to pull for him every hard-won, a** kicking step of the way.",4,Thriller,1305158400,"05 12, 2011",2011,2075,"['Parents', ""'re"", 'tempted', 'allow', 'teenagers', 'travel', 'own', 'Europe', 'watch', 'Taken', 'decide', 'Today', 'Europe', 'far', 'cry', 'romantic', 'picture', 'many', 'Americans', 'still', 'imagine', 'Bad', 'things', 'can', 'do', 'happen', 'naive', 'teens', 'arriving', 'adventure', 'Having', 'visited', 'France', 'setting', 'Taken', 'several', 'times', 'past', 'decade', 'can', 'say', 'firsthand', 'country', 'been', 'inundated', 'emigres', 'eastern', 'Europe', 'not', 'are', 'innocents', 'search', 'freedom', 'Organized', 'crime', 'assumed', 'new', 'face', 'new', 'mobsters', 'cases', 'newcomers', 'are', 'more', 'ruthless', 'natives.The', 'plot', 'Taken', 'centers', 'former', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'portrayed', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'daughter', 'off', 'European', 'jaunt', 'only', 'be', 'victimized', 'Albanians', 'eager', 'sell', 'virginal', 'charms', 'highest', 'bidder', 'Film', 'maker', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'rep', 'was', 'made', 'such', 'action', 'thrillers', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'up', 'tension', 'having', 'abduction', 'take', 'place', 'phone', 'call', 'father', 'daughter', 'feed', 'vital', 'info', 'thugs', 'When', 'one', 'up', 'cellphone', 'Mills', 'release', 'daughter', 'face', 'considerable', 'professional', 'wrath', 'course', 'blow', 'off', 'warning', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'never', 'ever', 'go.Neeson', 'displays', 'physical', 'side', 'literally', 'mowing', 'down', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'arsenal', 'awesome', 'martial', 'arts', 'moves', 'laser-eyed', 'shooting', 'ability', 'Keep', 'mind', 'normally', 'abhor', 'films', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'torture', 'endless', 'chase', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'read', 'lot', 'however', 'sex', 'trafficking', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'rooting', 'Mills', 'turn', 'up', 'electricity', 'take', 'out', 'SOB', 'Much', 'action', 'totally', 'implausible', 'crime', 'so', 'heinous', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Neeson', 'knife', 'edged', 'single', 'minded', 'merciless', 'sense', 'purpose', 'role', 'daughter', 'mother', 'are', 'mindless', 'social', 'twits', 'hard', 'not', 'pull', 'hard-won', 'kicking', 'step', 'way']",Taken

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired super-secret super-spy. Some time earlier his wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) dumped him for a rich older guy and took his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) with her. It was only after his retirement that Bryan could move to California to be closer to his now 17-years old daughter, but it is difficult to him to re-connect with Kim, as his former wife hates his guts and sabotages his efforts in every possible way. It doesn't help also that Kim's stepfather is obscenely rich and spoils her silly and that Kim herself is a jaded brat with brains of a gerbil...Then Kim goes to Paris with her slightly older, slutty and even more spoiled and brainless friend Amanda - and both girls get abducted by a gang of Albanian pimps... This will give Bryan a dreamed oportunity to humble his shrewish former wife, rub the face of her new husband in dirt, compensate finally for all the past humiliations, release all the accumulated anger and frustration and especially show to his daughter how much he really loves her. In the process the population of France, Albania and Saudi Arabia  will get significantly smaller...)))Now, objectively, this is a very, VERY silly film, with some moments really outlandishly funny, like when we learn that in Paris, France the ""baguette"" is actually apparel...))) On anover hand however, the bad guys are so abject and Bryan's cause so noble (save his teen age daughter from being repeteadly raped until death follows), that it is a pure DELIGHT to see Liam Neeson cut his way through Paris underworld like a terminally pissed combined harvester through wheat...)))Being myself a father of two daughters I couldn't help but LOVE the sight of rapists, pimps, women-trafficking slavers as well as their accomplices being viciously tortured, shot, stabbed, beaten to death, eviscerated, emasculated, beheaded, crushed with heavy engineering machines, drowned, set on fire, clubbed, thrown under speeding trucks, choked, boiled with hot steam, etc, etc.Liam Neeson delivers an IMPRESSIVE performance in this film - honestly, even Chuck Norris would probably hesitate before going toe to toe against Bryan Mills...))) Famke Janssen also is excellent as a very attractive and distinguished cynical shrewish gold digger whom we want to bitch-slap every time she appears on the screen and Maggie Grace is even better as a teen aged girl who, even if she has the maturity and the IQ of a recently planted radish, can manipulate her dear old silly daddy into virtually anything...)))If ""Taken"" is not taken too seriously, this is an absolutely delightful action film.

1194562,A36EW68H08UOCS,B001GCUNYO,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[2, 2]","""Taken"" is one of those action thrillers with a main character who is or was a double-dog secret government wreaker of mayhem.  Written by Luc Besson, who also made ""Leon: The Professional"", ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""The Transporter,"" you go into this film expecting that there will be several scenes featuring our hero single-handedly taking on a room full of bad guys and, as my Granny used to say, whuppin' the tar out of them.  Actually - he does more than whup most of them.  Most wind up looking pretty dead, although no one stops to check for a pulse once the bodies start piling up.The distinguishing characteristic ""Taken"" has over its brethren is the star.  Instead of Jason Statham or The Rock (20 years ago it would have been Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme), ""Taken"" stars lauded Irishman Liam Neeson.  The guy who played Schindler brings a degree of gravitas to a role not yet earned by most action stars.  There's a reason he provides the voice of Aslan in the Narnia films.In this film he plays Bryan Mills, who spent most of his married life on the road doing secret C.I.A. stuff, and enjoying it, but neglected his wife and daughter.  As a consequence Lenore (played by Famke Janssen) is now his ex-wife, and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace from ""Lost"") lives with mom and new step-dad, a super-rich businessman.Bryan regrets not being a better Dad and husband, so he has retired from the agency and moved near Kimmy, but when Kim lives in a mansion worthy of an NFL owner, it's tough for Bryan to compete for Kim's affection.Kim is invited with a friend on a Paris vacation and Mom pressures Bryan to sign the necessary forms so that Kim can leave the country.  After years of dealing with the world's shady characters, Bryan is reluctant, but signs the forms after giving Kim a few rules - mainly to stay in touch with an international cell phone Bryan gives her.Kim is in her opulent Paris digs for all of about an hour before Albanian drug and prostitute slave traders break into the apartment.  Dad is on the phone chastising Kim as the bad guys break in, and Bryan is able to piece together a few pieces of information when he tells Kim to give him as much description as she can before she is kidnapped.The rest of the movie consists of Bryan tearing apart Paris, one room of bad guys at a time.  At least four times he strolls casually into a situation surrounded by four or more baddies, and after the first few times the Mrs. and I would turn to each other and predict ""I think THOSE guys are about to have a BAD day"" each subsequent time he encountered more eurotrashy guys.At an hour and a half, Besson and director Pierre Morel keep the pace at a level that barely gives you time to catch your breath.  It's entertaining in a Bourne kind of way, and it makes me feel better seeing a man ten years my senior able to whup the tar out of a hundred bad guys.",4,Oskar Schindler as Super-Agent...,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,2884,"['Taken', 'one', 'action', 'thrillers', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'double-dog', 'secret', 'government', 'wreaker', 'mayhem', 'Written', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'who', 'also', 'made', 'Leon', 'Professional', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'Transporter', 'go', 'film', 'expecting', 'will', 'be', 'several', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'hero', 'single-handedly', 'taking', 'room', 'full', 'bad', 'guys', 'Granny', 'used', 'say', 'whuppin', 'tar', 'Actually', 'more', 'whup', 'most', 'Most', 'wind', 'up', 'looking', 'pretty', 'dead', 'one', 'check', 'pulse', 'bodies', 'start', 'piling', 'up.The', 'distinguishing', 'characteristic', 'Taken', 'over', 'brethren', 'star', 'Instead', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Rock', '20', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Taken', 'lauded', 'Irishman', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Schindler', 'degree', 'gravitas', 'role', 'not', 'yet', 'earned', 'most', 'action', 'stars', 'reason', 'voice', 'Aslan', 'Narnia', 'films.In', 'film', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'who', 'spent', 'most', 'married', 'life', 'road', 'doing', 'secret', 'C.I.A', 'stuff', 'enjoying', 'neglected', 'wife', 'daughter', 'consequence', 'Lenore', 'played', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'now', 'ex-wife', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'Lost', 'mom', 'new', 'step-dad', 'super-rich', 'businessman.Bryan', 'regrets', 'not', 'being', 'better', 'Dad', 'husband', 'retired', 'agency', 'moved', 'near', 'Kimmy', 'when', 'Kim', 'mansion', 'worthy', 'NFL', 'owner', 'tough', 'Bryan', 'compete', 'Kim', 'affection.Kim', 'invited', 'friend', 'Paris', 'vacation', 'Mom', 'pressures', 'Bryan', 'sign', 'necessary', 'forms', 'Kim', 'can', 'leave', 'country', 'years', 'dealing', 'world', 'shady', 'characters', 'Bryan', 'reluctant', 'signs', 'forms', 'giving', 'Kim', 'few', 'rules', 'mainly', 'stay', 'touch', 'international', 'cell', 'phone', 'Bryan', 'her.Kim', 'opulent', 'Paris', 'digs', 'hour', 'Albanian', 'drug', 'prostitute', 'slave', 'traders', 'break', 'apartment', 'Dad', 'phone', 'chastising', 'Kim', 'bad', 'guys', 'break', 'Bryan', 'able', 'piece', 'together', 'few', 'pieces', 'information', 'when', 'Kim', 'give', 'as', 'much', 'description', 'can', 'kidnapped.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'Bryan', 'tearing', 'apart', 'Paris', 'one', 'room', 'bad', 'guys', 'time', 'least', 'four', 'times', 'casually', 'situation', 'surrounded', 'four', 'more', 'baddies', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'Mrs.', 'would', 'turn', 'other', 'predict', 'think', 'THOSE', 'guys', 'are', 'have', 'BAD', 'day', 'subsequent', 'time', 'encountered', 'more', 'eurotrashy', 'guys.At', 'hour', 'half', 'Besson', 'director', 'Pierre', 'Morel', 'keep', 'pace', 'level', 'barely', 'time', 'catch', 'breath', 'entertaining', 'Bourne', 'kind', 'way', 'feel', 'better', 'seeing', 'man', 'ten', 'years', 'senior', 'able', 'whup', 'tar', 'hundred', 'bad', 'guys']",Taken

1194564,A17BUUBOU0598B,B001GCUNYO,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[0, 6]","Takenis a new movie starring Liam Neeson as a former security specialist who has relegated himself to the civilian sector to be closer to his daughter.  When a simple trip abroad puts his daughter and her friend in danger, he must swing back into action.  Visually, the movie is very well shot and will be a pleasure to watch in standard definition or Blu-Ray.  But the weak story holds back a movie that could have been much better.This film deals with kidnapping and human trafficking, very serious problems which have become overused in films of recent memory.  This film is entertaining as an action movie, though somewhat predictable.  But as a movie about human trafficking, the script is filled with numerous holes and inaccuracies that make it less than believable.  The less you know about the topic, the easier it will be for you to suspend disbelief and enjoy this as surface level entertainment.As Bryan Mills, Neeson attempts to channel a composite of Matt Damon's character from theThe Bourne Identitywith Denzel Washington's character fromMan on Fire.Bourne's odyssey and skills are easier to believe because of the economy of dialogue and the way the back-story is slowly fed to us.  In addition, the script of theThe Bourne Identitywas clearly well vetted and researched.  Here, Neeson's character says and does things that no trained security professional would ever do, like warning the villains that he is a trained security professional and that he is coming for them.  He is clearly no Bourne.In comparison with Denzel Washington's character, Neeson is not given nearly as much to work with in terms of emotion and dimension.  Denzel was given a character we could relate to through his human frailty.  But Neeson is given a wooden role with one-dimensional motivation.  One can even think to Russel Crowe's role inProof of Lifeas another point of comparison.  It's easy to see how little Neeson is given to work with here.The supporting cast is good, and includes Famke Janssen as Neeson's ex-wife.  However, there is a rather lengthy back-story that attempts to develop Neeson's character.  We get to meet his former security buddies and get to see how he interacts with his ex-wife and how much he sacrifices for his daughter.  By the time we get to the heart of the film, it's clear that much of that back-story could have been told in half the time to better effect.About half of the early cast could have been cut.  Similarly there are a lot of supporting scenes that could have been trimmed to maintain the suspense at a higher level.  The result is a movie with choppy pacing that drags on and feels longer than it is.The irony of that is that there is already an extended ""harder"" cut set to be released on Blu-Ray.  I will suspend disbelief till I see the extended version, but it's difficult for me to imagine making this movie better by adding scenes.  It seems like much of what was included could have made this movie better by being pared away.**** MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD -- STOP NOW TO AVOID ****As with any action movie, there are a number of fight scenes where Neeson seems to gain super-human dexterity, unlimited strength and omnipresent knowledge of all of his enemies.  Believe it or not, I can somewhat accept his ability to defeat any number of opponents as an action movie standard.  The fight choreography is actually very good as a whole.However, it gets worse. The numerous errors in the supporting sequences make it difficult to suspend disbelief.  With almost no information, he is able to ID his adversaries from some imaginary database that could only exist in the mind of a Hollywood producer and would never work in practice.  It's hard to believe that Neeson goes to Paris, after having been retired from overseas duty for several years, and somehow all his contacts are still there in roughly the same roles ready to provide him lodging and resources.Of course, everybody in Paris speaks English to him with pleasure.  Did any of the writers actually go to Paris for research before this movie?  It's difficult to accept that he could wander into a crime den masquerading as a French security agent while speaking English.  Then again, considering the same people he confronts have already gotten a visual ID on him, it's absurd that he isn't immediately shot.But then, to insult our intelligence even further, once we get to the climax scene and witness the people actually engaging in the human trafficking, we are shown a scenario that makesHostelseem plausible.  I don't want to give too much away.  But if you do get to see it ask yourself, ""would people breaking the law do so in this way?""Once again, if you can suspend disbelief some of those many things will not bother you as much.  But this is just the tip of the iceberg.CONCLUSIONThis movie is OK, hence my average rating.  It's a good way to pass the time, and those who love foreign thrillers and action movies will enjoy the fight scenes and top notch camera work.  But the predictable plot and factual errors undercut what could have been a much better movie.  Neeson is a very good actor, but he can't make up for a script that needed to be vetted by several fact checkers before the final cut.Judging by the enthusiastic foreign response to this movie, I can only hope that a completely separate cut was release for the European market.This is worth seeing for mindless entertainment, but if you're expecting something as good asThe Bourne Identityyou will likely be disappointed.Enjoy.",3,"Taken - OK For Entertainment, But Predictable And Filled With Holes",1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,5516,"['Takenis', 'new', 'movie', 'starring', 'Liam', 'Neeson',

For the fan of the action movie genre Liam Nesson plays the ultimate in kick ass bad guy as a former CIA agent who is out to take souls and break lives after his daughter Kim is abducted by Albanian gangster terrorists on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda. Nesson takes no prisoners and is quite sympathetic in his role as a father battling an incompetent governmental system to save his daughter and there's plenty of bloodshed and bad guys that end up on the wrong end of his gun, along with several edgy car chase scenes. As an action fan, you won't be disappointed with this film.As someone who has read a great deal of the problem of human trafficking, I was disappointed in the portrayal of human trafficking. Firstly although abductions do occur most domestic trafficking occurs through false job offers. Secondly, its' hard to believe that no one would take notice of an abduction that was that blatant. Furthermore, although the scenes featuring the girls as drug addicts are quite pointed, they felt to me more like an avenue to get to Nesson's character to kick some more ass rather then focus on the actual conditions that trafficked girls face. If I was doing this movie from a trafficking perspective, I would've spent more time focusing on what happens to Kim between abduction and rescue. Not only do you get more powerful visuals, but it would make Nesson's character even more sympathetic because the audience would get a broader view of Amanda's captivity. As a trafficking movie, the movie isn't the greatest at giving a realist view of the phenomenon.However, if your action movie buff who's looking for a ninety minute killer and are not looking for an expose on human trafficking.

So, it all comes down to how well and different it is executed.  I think Taken is executed fairly decently.  Though, this is mainly due to Liam Neeson and his performance, like in the famous telephone scene.  Without Neeson, this movie would not be nearly as enjoyable.The acting is alright.  No one did a bad job performance wise.  The only character worth talking about is Bryan Mills, played by Liam Neeson.  He is very likable, very driven, and kicks ass.  There are times were he comes off very mean and extreme.  However, I still liked him as a character, because of his situation.  I'm glad he came out on top in the end.  The rest of the characters are bland.  Maggie Grace's character is the typical teenage girl that gets kidnapped.  I did kind of feel for her, but not much, because I barely got to know her.  Famke Janssen, I did not care for at all.  She did nothing, and was very mean throughout most of the film.  The villains, I thought, were kind of nothing villains.  I did not find them intimidating.The film does move at a good pace.  The action scenes are fun and well-choreographed.

1194595,A28F4O4L9CDXUE,B001GCUNYO,M. K. Hammour,"[1, 1]","Liam Neeson lets loose a mean dose of delicious thuggery in Taken, a taut thriller that puts the viewer in the passenger seat right next to a hell-bent father seeking his stolen daughter and the blood of those behind her abduction. Deftly directed by District B13's Pierre Morel from a script by Luc Besson and writing partner Robert Mark Kamen, this tense actioner doesn't spend much time setting things up, nor does it decelerate once the flick picks up steam. Not one to overstay its welcome, this suspenseful tale is an economic exercise in delivering the goods for those who are interested in a two-fisted Liam Neeson vehicle to soak up, bask in, and then leave behind as soon as it's over. Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA agent who's left behind the service to help care for his teenaged daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), even if she spends most of her time with his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and her wealthy husband, Stuart (Xander Berkeley). Mills shows off his competence in combat early on after thwarting an attempt on the life of pop star Sheerah (Holly Valance), whom his daughter idolizes. Soon after, the 17-year-old is off to Paris, but only once she agrees to a strict set of rules, namely that the family knows where she is at all times. Plans derail when Kim is kidnapped while she's checking in on the phone with her father, who coolly deals with the situation and stays on the line long enough to deliver a killer speech to her captors. What follows is Mills' one-man mission to get his daughter back within 96 hours, using whatever European contacts he has left and the special lethal skills he's quite adept at dishing out. And dish them out Neeson does. Audiences get a clear idea of what sort of pain is in store for the bad guys early on during the pop-star rescue, which sets up the kind of swift brutality this character is capable of. The actor finds a cool partner in Morel, who delivers the action with a satisfyingly steady hand -- especially in the knife-fight finale, where a full-frame, one-take technique is honored in order to pay off the claustrophobic cabin setting without resorting to superficial style to keep the audience's juices flowing. In the acting department, Neeson is a single-minded, stone-faced wonder -- ready to pummel whoever needs to be knocked down in order to get to his daughter. As the daughter, Grace fulfills the dual nature of her character's arc, delivering both doe-eyed innocence and wide-eyed hysteria with competence. Sadly, Famke Janssen gets lost in the shuffle for most of the film, though to be fair, this flick isn't as much about the mother back home, but the trained torturer dad who'll stop at nothing to bust some slave-trader butt. Taken might still be on the fluffy side (the emotional beats, especially, feel forced), but it is of a higher pedigree than what action buffs have come to expect from French movie mogul Besson, whose post-directorial writer/producer stints range from the Transporter films to the tongue-in-explosive-cheek Taxi series. While cinephiles certainly won't flock to the flick, the inclusion of Neeson will hopefully tip some audiences off to the fact that there's something a little more to this intimate package than just your normal whiz-bang-pow big-budgeted romp. For fans of tough cinema, this is an installment worthy of comparison to the British crime films of old, which certainly share the narrow-minded propulsion of the plot, as well as having a venerable lead to chew the scenery as he pummels his way through a mystery. Needless to say, if you happen to be snatched up against your will, you could do a lot worse than have a Liam Neeson type waiting in the wings to brutalize his way to your rescue. ~ Jeremy Wheeler, All Movie Guide",4,Taken,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,3762,"['Liam', 'Neeson', 'loose', 'mean', 'dose', 'delicious', 'thuggery', 'Taken', 'taut', 'thriller', 'viewer', 'passenger', 'seat', 'right', 'next', 'hell-bent', 'father', 'seeking', 'stolen', 'daughter', 'blood', 'abduction', 'Deftly', 'directed', 'District', 'B13', 'Pierre', 'Morel', 'script', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'writing', 'partner', 'Robert', 'Mark', 'Kamen', 'tense', 'actioner', ""n't"", 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'setting', 'things', 'up', 'decelerate', 'once', 'flick', 'up', 'steam', 'Not', 'one', 'overstay', 'welcome', 'suspenseful', 'tale', 'economic', 'exercise', 'delivering', 'goods', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'two-fisted', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'vehicle', 'soak', 'up', 'bask', 'then', 'leave', 'as', 'soon', 'over', 'Neeson', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'ex-CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'left', 'service', 'help', 'care', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'even', 'most', 'time', 'ex-wife', 'Lenore', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'wealthy', 'husband', 'Stuart', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'Mills', 'competence', 'combat', 'early', 'thwarting', 'attempt', 'life', 'pop', 'star', 'Sheerah', 'Holly', 'Valance', 'whom', 'daughter', 'idolizes', 'Soon', '17-year-old', 'Paris', 'only', 'once', 'strict', 'set', 'rules', 'namely', 'family', 'where', 'times', 'Plans', 'derail', 'when', 'Kim', 'kidnapped', 'checking', 'phone', 'father', 'who', 'coolly', 'situation', 'stays', 'line', 'long', 'enough', 'deliver', 'killer', 'speech', 'captors', 'What', 'Mills', 'one-man', 'mission', 'get', 'daughter', 'back', '96', 'hours', 'using', 'European', 'contacts', 'left', 'special', 'lethal', 'skills', 'quite', 'adept', 'dishing', 'out', 'dish', 'out', 'Neeson', 'Audiences', 'get', 'clear', 'idea', 'what', 'sort', 'pain', 'store', 'bad', 'guys', 'early', 'pop-star', 'rescue', 'up', 'kind', 'swift', 'brutality', 'character', 'capable', 'actor', 'cool', 'partner', 'Morel', 'who', 'action', 'satisfyingly', 'steady', 'hand', 'especially', 'knife-fight', 'finale', 'where', 'full-frame', 'one-take', 'technique', 'honored', 'order', 'pay', 'off', 'claustrophobic', 'cabin', 'setting', 'resorting', 'superficial', 'style', 'keep', 'audience', 'juices', 'flowing', 'acting', 'department', 'Neeson', 'single-minded', 'stone-faced', 'wonder', 'ready', 'pummel', 'whoever', 'be', 'knocked', 'down', 'order', 'get', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'Grace', 'dual', 'nature', 'character', 'arc', 'delivering', 'doe-eyed', 'innocence', 'wide-eyed', 'hysteria', 'competence', 'Sadly', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'most', 'film', 'be', 'fair', 'flick', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'mother', 'back', 'home', 'trained', 'torturer', 'dad', 'who', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'nothing', 'bust', 'slave-trader', 'butt', 'Taken', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'fluffy', 'side', 'emotional', 'beats', 'especially', 'feel', 'forced', 'higher', 'pedigree', 'what', 'action', 'buffs', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'French', 'movie', 'mogul', 'Besson', 'post-directorial', 'writer/producer', 'stints', 'range', 'Transporter', 'films', 'tongue-in-explosive-cheek', 'Taxi', 'series', 'cinephiles', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'flock', 'flick', 'inclusion', 'Neeson', 'will', 'hopefully', 'tip', 'audiences', 'off', 'fact', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'intimate', 'package', 'just', 'normal', 'whiz-bang-pow', 'big-budgeted', 'romp', 'fans', 'tough', 'cinema', 'installment', 'worthy', 'comparison', 'British', 'crime', 'films', 'old', 'certainly', 'share', 'narrow-minded', 'propulsion', 'plot', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'venerable', 'lead', 'chew', 'scenery', 'way', 'mystery', 'Needless', 'say', 'happen', 'be', 'snatched', 'up', 'will', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'have', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'type', 'waiting', 'wings', 'brutalize', 'way', 'rescue', '~', 'Jeremy', 'Wheeler', 'All', 'Movie', 'Guide']",Taken

Young girls (and boys) should watch this as a precautionary tale to anyone who is going to travel abroad or domestic, or when you meet a stranger here or there.Liam Neeson plays a semi absentee father who has been working as a highly trained operative on missions around the world.  His time away from home cost him his marriage, now his teenage daughter has asked through his ex wife to take a trip to Europe.  At first she tells him that they will be going to museums and doing touristy things, but he finds just before she leaves that they are really going to travel across Europe to see U2 on the European leg of their tour.  Reluctanly, he agrees (even though he is angry that his daughter and his ex wife lied about it to him) and signs the papers to allow her to travel.  In typical law enforcement manner, Liam demands that his daughter call and let him know where she is at all times.  His daughter and her friend, however, being the stereotypical flaky teenagers they are, say hello to a random stranger they meet at the airport.  He seems friendly enough, offers to share a cab to their destination, then gets their phone number.  Little do they know they are being lured into a trap.  And what a trap it is!  In a panic, his daughter tells her father on the phone that they are being kidnapped.  Liam immediately jumps onto a plane and heads to Paris to track his daughter down from the sex slavery ring she has been lured into.The older I get, the more I see the signifigance of a story like that.  Having traveled abroad and been hassled and hustled by many a suave European man, be cautious.  You never know who is going to take you for a ride.  They may not be pulling you into sex slavery, but they are looking for something else.  And it also happens right here in the US, in your own backyard.  I have several friends in law enforcement, they question everything and anything I do.  ""DO you know that man you were talking to over there?"" ""Yes, I know him from ___"".  Paranoid?  It has merit.

And really, that is about it - in an era of sophisticated thrillers with labyrinthine plots, the narrative here seems very simple and told in straightforward linear fashion, with few if any surprises.And yet, it works - because it is lean and fast - the action is brutal and frenetic in close up Bourne style, and once events kick off it really does not let up until the unsurprising conclusion.  Neeson is lithe and believable as a trained killing machine, giving the film a huge boost of credibility.There is it has to be said a mean streak in Neeson's character at odds with the family man, as he mercilessly kills off any and everything that gets in his way.  In fact, it becomes almost unpleasant that the film is purporting an American has a right to do whatever he likes in Europe to protect `his own', including torture, on the spot assassinations, and untold collateral damage.However, watched as a straight action flick, this is entertaining enough, as long as you have a strong stomach for the unpleasant underbelly of Paris dying as faces are smashed into hard objects, bullets shatter limbs, and others die in... well, let's say shocking ways.

The trouble is, while she seems happy enough to see him when he manages to meet her, usually she won't give him the time of day.  She's got all she wants from her enormously wealthy stepfather, and all she wants from her real father is permission to go to Paris.  He's reluctant because, as an ex-spy, I guess, he knows that Europe can be much more dangerous than most people think, especially for a naive young woman.  It turns out he's right, because the moment his daughter arrives with her friend in Paris, she's targeted and kidnapped by sex traffickers.  She manages to get a phone call off to her dad before she's abducted and immediately he's on the case - figures out who they are and plans do do much more than kick butt on his way to saving her.Directed by Pierre Morel, this film has all the marks of its producer and writer, Luc Besson.  Mills is a classic Bessonian hero - who does what he does without remorse, and ruthlessly, but all in the service of good old-fashioned family values.  Luc Besson's heroes tend to be jaded professionals, highly competent at killing but without direction in their lives until they discover that they are meant to save some innocent, to fix some kind of family crisis.  It's a weird mix of visceral violence and sentimentality.  He takes on anyone who gets in his way, anyone who threatens his daughter, anyone who even refuses to help him on his way, and, according to the bizarre but effective Hollywood action film logic that Bresson distills to its essence, it's all okay, it's all morally acceptable, and it all comes out in the end.  The basic principle is that the ends always justifies the means, especially if family is at stake.  In films likeDie Hard, there's something else at stake (lots of innocent lives, money, national security), but family is at the heart of it, and in this film that becomes the whole of it, sex trafficking merely becomes the vehicle, the focus for a father's rage.  Of course if you stop to think about it, you have to realize that this guy is a psychopath, and that there are proper channels for a reason, given the number of innocent lives he puts at risk on his quest to stop the bad guys - even though most of the bad guys he actually dispatches are truly bad.  Still, it's strange how easy it is, watching a film like this, to buy all that, and how hard it is not to.  It's a precise, taut, effective, action thriller, and Liam Neeson brings just the right mix of emotional intensity and ruthlessness for the audience to care about him and his emotional quest in spite of themselves.",3,Father knows best...death to any and all who threaten his little girl,1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,2683,"['Bryan', 'Mills', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'retired', 'divorced', 'ex-spy', 'who', 'now', 'only', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'trouble', 'happy', 'enough', 'see', 'when', 'meet', 'usually', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'time', 'day', 'got', 'enormously', 'wealthy', 'stepfather', 'real', 'father', 'permission', 'go', 'Paris', 'reluctant', 'because', 'ex-spy', 'guess', 'Europe', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'dangerous', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'especially', 'naive', 'young', 'woman', 'out', 'right', 'moment', 'daughter', 'friend', 'Paris', 'targeted', 'kidnapped', 'sex', 'traffickers', 'get', 'phone', 'call', 'dad', 'abducted', 'immediately', 'case', 'figures', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'plans', 'do', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'kick', 'butt', 'way', 'saving', 'her.Directed', 'Pierre', 'Morel', 'film', 'marks', 'producer', 'writer', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'Mills', 'classic', 'Bessonian', 'hero', 'who', 'what', 'remorse', 'ruthlessly', 'service', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'family', 'values', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'heroes', 'tend', 'be', 'jaded', 'professionals', 'highly', 'competent', 'killing', 'direction', 'lives', 'discover', 'are', 'meant', 'save', 'innocent', 'fix', 'kind', 'family', 'crisis', 'weird', 'mix', 'visceral', 'violence', 'sentimentality', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'anyone', 'who', 'daughter', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'help', 'way', 'according', 'bizarre', 'effective', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'film', 'logic', 'Bresson', 'essence', 'okay', 'morally', 'acceptable', 'out', 'end', 'basic', 'principle', 'ends', 'always', 'means', 'especially', 'family', 'stake', 'films', 'likeDie', 'Hard', 'something', 'else', 'stake', 'lots', 'innocent', 'lives', 'money', 'national', 'security', 'family', 'heart', 'film', 'whole', 'sex', 'trafficking', 'merely', 'vehicle', 'focus', 'father', 'rage', 'course', 'stop', 'think', 'have', 'realize', 'guy', 'psychopath', 'are', 'proper', 'channels', 'reason', 'given', 'number', 'innocent', 'lives', 'risk', 'quest', 'stop', 'bad', 'guys', 'even', 'most', 'bad', 'guys', 'actually', 'dispatches', 'are', 'truly', 'bad', 'Still', 'strange', 'how', 'easy', 'watching', 'film', 'buy', 'how', 'hard', 'not', 'precise', 'taut', 'effective', 'action', 'thriller', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'ruthlessness', 'audience', 'care', 'emotional', 'quest', 'spite']",Taken

The movie has nice action sequences, a lovely setting and some intense moments, but ultimately is too implausible and sometimes even silly. The acting is marginal, and the plot has some large holes. That said, watching scumbags get blown away by a grim-faced and seemingly indestructible angel of vengeance dad is fun enough--especially if you enjoy popcorn action flicks (Commandoanyone?!?). Just be aware of what you're getting here: this is 80 minutes of bad-guy beat-downs with a plot exists simply to try and pull it all together.Neeson plays an ex-CIA 'preventer' turned remorseful dad trying to earn back his daughter's affections in typically silly single-dad ways. When she decides to head to Paris with her teenybopper, valley-girl friend, overprotective dad begrudgingly agrees to let her go, but lays down some rules, and gives her an international cell phone to call him with each morning and night (something he might have learned in a previous career as a parole officer). Of course things go horribly awry and the girls are kidnapped by some deviant Albanian sex-traders. Albanians appear to be the new Russians in post cold-war thriller movies. I guess the Russians deserve a break; they had a good run.The first 30 minutes of the film are spent on the set-up, and by the time Neeson finally lands in Paris and starts to administer a few butt-kickings, my response was 'it's about freakin time!' since I had been led to believe this was in fact a thriller/action flick, not a commentary on overprotective, guilt ridden fathers and their whining, uncoordinated daughters--Remember when I said the acting was marginal at best? Maggie Grace who plays daughter Kim, spends most of her screen time awkwardly running from place to place, arms and legs akimbo-- or yet another divorced dad/mom are both jerk stories.The story thunders forward with all the subtlety of a freight train running off its rails as Neeson beats up roomfuls of villains with an ease that makes the viewer believe he could probably still do it with one arm tied behind his back. He is also most definitely a marksman; I believe he never misses who he's aiming at through the entire film--in fact he seems to administer single shot kills like Kobe drains three-pointers. Overall, his amazing marksmanship and Batman like superiority even in 10-1 combat scenarios are what really destroyed the movie for me: there is never a time when the viewer is forced to worry for Neeson. There is no 'burden' on the viewer to pull for him. We already know what's going to happen.In the entire film, Neeson is in real jeopardy for about 3 seconds. That's right, three seconds. That is during a brief stint as a captive in the basement of Mr. St-Clair (by far the movies most compelling baddy, a sort of super-pimp selling girls to the worlds richest scum bags) before he immediately locates an escape route and continues with his reign of holy terror. It is also St-Clair who tells Neeson ""You have to understand, it was always only business,"" to which Neeson replies ""It was all personal to me,"" a classic one-liner for which I've bumped the movie up a half star. It made me laugh.If there is one thing that Neeson's character is not, it's conflicted about doing what's necessary to find and save his daughter. He is as unconcerned with torture as he is with collateral damage or even shooting a complete innocent in the arm just to prove a point. Nothing is more important than saving his daughter, and while that might make him a pretty awful neighbor in real life, it comes across as refreshing in a Hollywood environment where soul-anguished mamby-pamby heroes seem to be all the rage.By the film's conclusion, Neeson has succeeded in killing probably about a 100 thugs, creeps, perverts, and scum bags. --SPOILER WARNING!-- He's got his daughter back, is safe in the States, and has even earned the respect of his Ex and her Mr. Monopoly husband. Not bad. However, it was all so easy, so painless (for Neeson at least!), and the darker underpinnings of the movie handily swept under the rug (like the fate of Kim's valley-girl friend or the implications of ends-justify-the-means torture) that watching Kim head off to voice lessons with a Jewel/Brittany hybrid in the obligatory Hollywood ending is just too sappy & stupid for my tastes.2.5/5 Stars. Silly in many ways, but there is some fun to be had watching jerks getting head-shotted by an angry Uber Dad. Too bad it wasn't built around a better plot with a bit more intelligence (something likeThe Punisherbut directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Hugh Jackman--Now that I would happily pay to see).",3,"""It Was All Personal To Me""",1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,4788,"['movie', 'premise', 'might', 'have', 'spawned', 'real', '5-star', 'film', 'vein', 'far', 'superiorBourne', 'Ultimatum',

It is so unoriginal that you could have predicted the outcome if you know your film qualities. People that gave this 5 stars must be those that are easily satisfied.

Don't believe me? Watch it.

Having an actor of Neeson's stature lends a certain degree of credibility that Taken wouldn't oterwise have, and that alone makes the film worth seeing.  Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, an ex-spy trying to reconcile his estranged relationship with his teen daughter Kim (Maggie Grace).  When Kim goes to Paris with a friend, and subsequently gets kidnapped, Bryan springs into action to save her, and breaks many bones along the way.  There are some genuine surprising moments to be found in Taken, amidst the gaping plot holes, leaps in logic, and overall incoherency.

I've lived in SE Asia, working not in but alongside crusaders fighting this sorry malignancy. I know...it's only a movie. It's only the well from which our culture draws its knowledge.The good guy (Liam) has less dimension than a straight line: he is simply not believable and thus is never engaging. Liam is always liam, whether in kilts, Jedi rags, WWII garb, Les Mis stripes, or chaps. Abysmal, our movie icons.Anyway, the bad guys are NEVER shown being brutally bad, thus there is little reptilian satisfaction in their roastings, plumbings and guttings.

Taken is a return to some 1980s-type revenge movie antics, with Liam Neeson fitting into the hero role where we often expect a more musclebound star.If you've seen the trailer...you know where it's going.  Neeson is some kind of ex-CIA operative, a ""preventer"", whose daughter is kidnapped about 10 seconds after landing in Paris.  Using some spare info she gave him on a long distance mobile phone call, he travels to Paris, and within minutes is cracking heads.  The villains are a band of Albanian kidnappers who grab travelling girls and sell them into prostitution.  Neeson single-handedly takes down a good portion of the crew in the course of this film, wiping folks out with chops to the throat, bullets, and even a makeshift electric chair.The movie is pure audience manipulation, and you'll be rooting for Neeson to bash heads with glee.  The daughter and her airhead friend are helpfully stupid, immediately talking to strangers who work for the kidnappers, Neeson's ex-wife is appropriately awful, and the ex-CIA-guy-as-Superman cliche is amply employed.  The movie is very brisk, has several action set pieces (including at least two car chases filmed like car commercials, of course), and knows that you know it's getting ridiculous but not letting up.  Neeson is very convincing as a calm, collected, demolition man who knows all sorts of random, McGuyver-esque tricks and barely breaks a sweat as he chases cars on foot, takes out a dozen guys in a minute, and breaks all manners of bones and heads, while wrecking parts of Paris, to track down his daughter.The American version was surprisingly rated PG-13, even with Neeson taking out about 30 guys, and with the plot of international prostitute smuggling cheerily explored.  The Extended, Unrated version adds some more gunshots and chops in, and indeed is less jerky since you could tell things were cut to get the softer rating.Highly recommended for fans of fast-paced, man-on-a-mission revenge flicks, this is great for repeat viewings, and very ripe for sequel or even franchise potential.  They'd be crazy not to explore Neeson whooping some other gang-du-jour in a prequel or new episode where his puppy is kidnapped.",5,A very particular set of head-bashing skills,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,2253,"['movie', 'be', 'big', 'DVD', 'hit', 'good', 'reason', 'Taken', 'return', '1980s-type', 'revenge', 'movie', 'antics', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'fitting', 'hero', 'role', 'where', 'often', 'expect', 'more', 'musclebound', 'star.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'Neeson', 'kind', 'ex-CIA', 'operative', 'preventer', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', '10', 'seconds', 'landing', 'Paris', 'Using', 'spare', 'info', 'gave', 'long', 'distance', 'phone', 'call', 'Paris', 'minutes', 'cracking', 'heads', 'villains', 'are', 'band', 'Albanian', 'kidnappers', 'who', 'grab', 'travelling', 'girls', 'sell', 'prostitution', 'Neeson', 'single-handedly', 'down', 'good', 'portion', 'crew', 'course', 'film', 'wiping', 'folks', 'out', 'chops', 'throat', 'bullets', 'even', 'makeshift', 'electric', 'chair.The', 'movie', 'pure', 'audience', 'manipulation', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rooting', 'Neeson', 'bash', 'heads', 'glee', 'daughter', 'airhead', 'friend', 'are', 'helpfully', 'stupid', 'immediately', 'talking', 'strangers', 'who', 'work', 'kidnappers', 'Neeson', 'ex-wife', 'appropriately', 'awful', 'ex-CIA-guy-as-Superman', 'cliche', 'amply', 'employed', 'movie', 'very', 'brisk', 'several', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'including', 'least', 'two', 'car', 'chases', 'filmed', 'car', 'commercials', 'course', 'know', 'getting', 'ridiculous', 'not', 'letting', 'up', 'Neeson', 'very', 'convincing', 'calm', 'collected', 'demolition', 'man', 'who', 'sorts', 'random', 'McGuyver-esque', 'tricks', 'barely', 'breaks', 'sweat', 'cars', 'foot', 'out', 'dozen', 'guys', 'minute', 'manners', 'bones', 'heads', 'wrecking', 'parts', 'Paris', 'track', 'down', 'daughter.The', 'American', 'version', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'even', 'Neeson', 'taking', 'out', '30', 'guys', 'plot', 'international', 'prostitute', 'smuggling', 'cheerily', 'explored', 'Extended', 'Unrated', 'version', 'more', 'gunshots', 'chops', 'indeed', 'less', 'jerky', 'could', 'tell', 'things', 'were', 'cut', 'get', 'softer', 'rating.Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'fast-paced', 'man-on-a-mission', 'revenge', 'flicks', 'great', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'very', 'ripe', 'sequel', 'even', 'franchise', 'potential', ""'d"", 'be', 'crazy', 'not', 'explore', 'Neeson', 'whooping', 'other', 'gang-du-jour', 'prequel', 'new', 'episode', 'where', 'puppy', 'kidnapped']",Taken

The daughter wants to take a trip overseas with a friend, her father objects but relents with conditions that she ignores.Lucky for her she keeps the phone he gave him and at about the 27 minute mark when she is taken he gives his ultimatum to the man on the other line, his daughter or his life.

The locale is different and his foes are not looking for his cash but the quest is the same, the girl alive OR them dead, each and every one of them, but he makes a slight alteration; the  OR becomes an AND.LikeTradewe see the inhumanity of the modern slave trade and the indifference of those who practice it.

His concern about his daughter's trip to Europe turns out to be correct when she is kidnapped, and he spends most of the movie doing whatever it takes to rescue her.  The rage and violence that Neeson shows is credible in light of the brutal kidnapping of his daughter, allowing him to be more complex than the heroes in many action thrillers. The action is non-stop and includes some great sequences.  The subplot involving police corruption adds to the story instead of bogging things down, and emphasizes that Neeson is on his own with his rescue mission.The Blu-Ray has excellent image quality and audio, with a decent if not huge array of extras.

But I did watch the Digital Copy that came with it, installed on my PC, during a plane ride. One thing I noticed was that the Digital Copy was of very good quality, with little or no artefacts despite the many night scenes.My first impression was, who would have thought Liam Neeson would make such a good hero ? Credit goes to whoever took the decision to cast him as Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA type with deadly skills. His daughter's kidnappers in Paris would learn what these skills are as the film progresses from one action scene to another. It barely pauses, except for the initial 20 minutes when there's not much action.There have been a number of `rescue-your-kidnapped-daughter' films, most noticeably Man on Fire and Commando. These two featured much younger daughters than Taken. But in the end, Taken is more emotionally satisfying (if you can use that term for a film in which around 50 people get killed) than either of them.I saw somewhere on the Net Taken being described as a `horror' film. Yes, it is a nightmare for parents for if their offpring is `Taken' by kidnappers.  Neeson is superb as the distraught father, though his acting won't win Oscars in a film like this. The storyline, though containing some plot holes, is believable. Trafficking in young women is a serious problem especially in poorer countries, though the West is not immune, as depicted in the film. Taken producers deserve thanks for highlighting this problem.Taken is a thrill ride you will not forget in a hurry.

But a more important issue is how silly the whole story is. Neeson's character is a highly trained ex-government agent who has a daughter who wants to travel to Europe following U2's tour dates as they travel. Neesun's character knows the world all too well and is concerned for her safety. He tries to talk her out of it knowing how dangerous it is to travel to another country. To make a long story short- He gives in an let's her go. Well she arrives, and in less than a few hours She get's kidnapped by criminals who want to sell her on the black market as a sex slave. Like the audience is actually supposed to swallow such nonsense? Naturally he must go and rescue his daughter on his own, and he expertly kills at least 50 people on his journey until he finally finds her. He's (of course) left almost unwounded through the entire affair. The good news is that the film is filled with some excellent and well crafted action sequences that make it worth seeing.

To start, I was ready to pull the plug and call it a bust but I'm glad I hung in there.  The only compelling part of this movie was Bryan Mills' (Liam Neeson) tenacity, resourcefulness and ability to kick a**.  The movie started very slow and uninteresting.  I'm well aware that movies need some character build up time, but I found that I didn't like the characters.  When a spoiled girl lies to trick her father into letting her go to Paris with another equally young and naive girl only to be kidnapped... we tend to say: you make your bed you lie in it.  You reap what you sow is also applicable.  So, to start, I wasn't all that sympathetic nor was I moved to fully root for Bryan Mills to get his daughter back against all odds.My attitude soon changed.  It didn't change because I saw the purity and innosence of his daughter, it changed once I began to see the sheer creepery (or should I say creepness?) of the characters involved in the kidnapping.

The trailer of the movie caught my attention right away, the story may be a little thin but the action and constant pace of the film will keep you tuned in.Taken is a story about a CIA retiree named Brian Mlls who is a father to a 17 year old girl with ex-wife who remarried a rich man. The connection between the mother and father is very disjointed, they don't agree on everything and their only conenction they have with each other is the daughter. The daughter decides to go on a trip to Europe with a friend and ends up getting kidnapped and trafficked, being sold as a prostitute to a slum lord and now the father must use of all of his acquired skills as a CIA agent and try to rescue his daughter before it is too late.Now while the story may be very simple, it is the action that is truly entertaining to watch. Liam Neeson may be old but he can still whoop some serious ass. His character is relentless and will kill anyone that will get in his way of saving his daughter. Liam Neesons character is pretty damn resourceful and highly intelligent, I would say that this is basically another ""Bourne"" type movie but with a more mature protagonist. While it may seem this character is just a murderer in every sense (I would say he kills about 30 people in this movie) its the drive that comepletly makes the viewers overlook all of the violence and just root for Liam hoping he finds his daighter in the end.

He is completely believable as the retired CIA assassin who goes to great lengths to return his kidnapped daughter.  Now granted that suspension of belief is key to any movie but Taken really tests this. For one thing, no one but Neeson's character seems to be able to shot straight and he is mysteriously impervious to bullets.Also, he can overcome any security system and much like the Rambo movies, if there is a place guarded by 100 armed men, he can take it single handily. The other characters are superfluous and the other friend who goes to Paris with Maggie Grace might as well have one of the old Star Trek red shirts because we know she's going to be sacrificed to show how bad these dudes are.All in all a movie that well good enough, could have been so much better with some thought put into the script.",3,A little more acting and plot would have gone a long way,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,945,"['have', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Taken', 'First', 'think', 'best', 'thing', 'acting', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'completely', 'believable', 'retired', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'who', 'great', 'lengths', 'return', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'Now', 'granted', 'suspension', 'belief', 'key', 'movie', 'Taken', 'really', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'Neeson', 'character', 'be', 'able', 'shot', 'straight', 'mysteriously', 'impervious', 'bullets.Also', 'can', 'overcome', 'security', 'system', 'much', 'Rambo', 'movies', 'place', 'guarded', '100', 'armed', 'men', 'can', 'take', 'single', 'handily', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'superfluous', 'other', 'friend', 'who', 'Paris', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'one', 'old', 'Star', 'Trek', 'red', 'shirts', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'show', 'how', 'bad', 'dudes', 'are.All', 'movie', 'well', 'good', 'enough', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'thought', 'put', 'script']",Taken

I'm not going to review the movie; it's old enough that it really doesn't need one more person's assessment (I really did like it though).  Although I am not having an issue playing the disc at all, as many 1-star reviewers have noted, I experienced horrible macro-blocking and strange light/dark bands flashing on the screen for about 2/3 of the movie.  I had rented the DVD years ago, and I actually like the movie (shameless action movie entertainment) but I wanted the Blu Ray version.  I don't know if anybody else has had the same issue as me, but you can clearly see very distracting pixelated areas in dark scenes, and huge bands about 1/3 of the height of my 1080p tv where the colors alternate between darker and lighter shades of the rest of the screen, and it kept alternating, so I would see a light picture across the top and bottom, dark across the center, and it would flip around and alternate, just to make sure I didn't forget about it and actually enjoy the movie. I played it on my PC's blu-ray player with PowerDVD 13.  I will try it in my Panasonic player, and maybe the PS3 to be sure, but I haven't had issues with any other discs.  I watched Pacific Rim, Oblivion, Man of Steel, and I Am Legend, all new (to me) Blu-Rays this week without a hitch.

If you were satisfied with the pure straight Balls To The Wall action style that Leon offered, look no further than Taken, with Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace! Taken is an action movie that just is pure energy and action from beginning to end.In ""Taken"", Liam Neeson plays Bryan, an ex-CIA agent who is divorced from his wife, yet still sees his Daughter on a regular basis. His latest thing he's done is protect a repressed pop singer from a violent riot that happens after a concert of hers. Later, he learns that his daughter wants to go to Europe with her friend, and he very reluctantly lets her. Within the very first hour of their arrival in Paris, they are both captured by two people, and Bryan, being the overprotective flake he is, learns that these two people addict the girls they capture to drugs, and eventually, within 96 hours, they become prostitutes in the European Sex Slave Trade. Bryan travels to Paris to save her. He has 96 hours to find her and get her to safety or it's too late!More effective than an energy drink, this movie wastes no time and just gets straight to the point right away. There's lots of great action, and the finale on the boat is a total ""WHOA"" moment. The only problem I had with this film is that even though I loved it, I had the feeling as if I had seen it before somewhere.

I know a lot is unbelievable and even impossible. I like the basic storyline and the intense action. It also hits on a real life issue of human trafficking. Exposing issues like this may help make people be more aware and help to stop such heinous acts. Again, as a movie, I think some people are reading too much into it giving it undo lowered ratings. Movies are for entertainment and this movie is entertaining. I  think Shrek is an entertaining movie and I don't expect to see a large green ogre appearing around the corner.Third, as a bluray DVD which I purchased, I am very disappointed. The quality of the picture is only about equivalent to a standard DVD and the dark scenes are very grainy looking worse than VHS if any of you out there even remember VHS. Some good with the DVD format is the extra scenes and a cool death/injured counter throughout the movie.

Retired CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) hopes to restore his relationship with his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and reluctantly agrees to let her travel to France with a friend. When Kim and her friend are kidnapped by slave runners, Bryan must resort to his special skills to scour the French underworld before she disappears forever. Though not a groundbreaking movie, ""Taken"" is an amusing action-packed thriller from director Pierre Morel (The Transporter) and producer Luc Besson (The Fifth Element). It was released in France in February of 2008 but was released in the United States in January of 2009. With $145 million in the North American box-office, it was one of the first successful films of 2009. The story is straight forward with a few twists and character clich&eacute;s. Neeson's performance further drives the drama and the action sequences are a total blast.Despite a few early lackluster releases, 20th Century Fox has certainly deliver some fine looking Blu-Ray titles and ""Taken"" 2-disc Extended Cut is no exception. Both the 91-minute theatrical cut and the 93-minute unrated cut are presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. With a splendid level of detail and rich lifelike colors, the picture quality is indeed impressive. Its DTS-HD audio offers top quality clarity, dynamic surround effects and some good bass. Its special features include two audio commentary tracks by the film's director and crew, the ""Black Ops Field Manual"" option that allows viewers to follow the progress of the story, footage of the film's premier and two behind-the-scenes featurettes (Le Making of & Inside Action: Side By Side Comparisons).

1194689,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B001GCUNYO,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","So says the films protagonist Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson)talking to his daughter's kidnapper over the phone.If you like your action straight up,no chasers,then Taken,released in Feb.2008 and put onto DVD in /09,is THE film for you.Once the action starts,it's a hold-onto-your-seats thrill ride that never lets up.The plot is pretty straightforward.An ex CIA special agent Bryan Mills is attending his daughter's birthday party.From the get go Mills we see is meticulous in his personal habits,all stemming from his background training.His CIA days are behind him but he still keeps in touch with some of his former close associates.His daughter Kim's(Maggie Grace)mother Lenore(Famke Janssen) has remarried and Bryan's relationship with her is quite strained.When Mills meets with his daughter and ex for lunch,Kim asks for his permission to go to Paris with her girlfriend.He is reluctant and he thinks about it.He eventually comes around and Kim is away,with a few stipulations her dad has made on her.The two arrive in Paris and head for their rented flat.On the way they meet a nice looking young man who they arrange to attend a party with later on.While the two are unpacking some unknown men enter the apartment and Kim's friend is taken away in a big struggle.Kim has been talking on the phone with her dad and she describes to him in detail what is taking place.Frightened and barely hanging on, all due to her dad's calm demeanor/training,she hides in an adjacent bedroom under a bed.He tells her she will be taken but to leave the phone open as long as she can and,most importantly,he will come for her.Kim is dragged away as Mills listens.Springing into action he contacts not only her mother but his old associates who offer some technical skills in obtaining background info on the kidnappers.Mills only positive lead is that he has heard the sound of one of the kidnappers.He flies to Paris and clandestinely enters the girls apartment.He tenders the help of an old Paris police detective which leads him nowhere.From the memory card of his daughters smashed telephone he garners a picture of one of her kidnappers.He tracks him down at the airport and just when it seems he has eluded Mills he gets killed by a passing truck.Mills knows that an Albanian gang,specializing in human trafficking,is the group responsible for taking his daughter.This leads him to a construction site which also houses a brothel run by the gang.He puts a temporary stop to the place by almost completely demolishing the operation but in the process gets a lead in the form of a heavily drugged girl who has his daughters jacket.He takes her to a motel and dries her out and gets the address of the place Kim might be at.He poses as a French policeman there to renegotiate his ""fee"" to keep quiet about their operations and enters the den of the Albanian traffickers.While there he fingers the man whose voice he heard briefly on the phone and after some further""negotiations"", leaves with his man.Using some plain old fashioned torture,he gleans the info that his daughter is now in the hands of a wealthy Parisian socialite who specializes in the sale of human flesh.Mills attends that function and poses as a waiter serving champagne.While in the small room with a buyer he finally sees his daughter,which he forces the buyer to obtain.While leaving the room to get his daughter(with the buyer in tow)the security there gets the best of him and his is held downstairs to be executed.Before they can do him in he is able to get free and turn the tables.He rushes out after his daughter who is now aboard a yacht owned by a wealthy Sheik.Through a car ride to beat all car rides he tries to catch up to the boat and eventually is able to jump aboard and overcome most of the security with all the usual lightening fast moves he has so far displayed throughout the film.He finally comes face to face with the Sheik holding his daughter at knife point.At the very moment the Sheik is about to negotiate with Mills,Mills shoots him dead with precision aim.Daughter Kim safely back in his arms,they both fly home.Famed French writer,director Luc Besson(The Fifth Element)uses a deft hand in his control here.The editing is top notch;no filler and all meat.The action once it starts,is breathtaking to watch as Mills' former ""training""/""special skills"" are something to behold indeed.Neeson is right in the zone throughout which adds that much more to the believability and intensity of the proceedings.The supporting cast is great and the stunt work wonderful.Technically is the film has been transferred onto DVD in its original 2:40:1 a/r,and is clear and crisp.This version has both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film.There is commentary,the trailer and a making of featurette.There is however something the buyer should be aware of and it is in the making of the DVD itself.There is a scene where Mills enters the Albanians lair(behind the red door).He presents a card to one of the kidnappers.At that moment there seems to be a layer change and the film briefly stops ans starts.This is a common thing but here the sound actually goes out of sync with the actions/mouths on screen.I have checked this on a couple of players and it does it on both.It's a manufacturers glitch and should have been taken care of but of course these things never are unless the release is successful enough to warrant a future re-release.Gotta love this industry don't you?All in all a top notch effort by all involved.Neeson is the intense protagonist who you just KNOW is going to get his man,or in this case his daughter.We know the ending before it really gets going but the trick is to sit back and enjoy the ride,and what a ride it is.4 1/2 stars,recommended viewing.",4,"""I have special skills""",1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,5756,"['So', 'films',

1194691,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B001GCUNYO,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","I hate to say it, but this is a perfectly awful film.Right from the start, there is something wrong with the tone of the film, as the retired agent is trying to get close to the daughter he alienated by his long and mysterious absences.  The viewer gets dished up a dripping melodrama about a painful divorce, with all the hot button scenes - trying to get her attention with a gift, his ex-wife standing in the way the whole while with bitter sarcasm, and the innocent (beautiful) daughter pampered by her new dad - that are supposed to pull at the heartstrings.  The acting was so wooden and the dialogue so stilted that I couldn't believe any of it.Then suddenly, the tone shifts:  dad excessively worries about the daughter going to Europe on her own at 17, and sure enough, she is immediately abducted by the worst kind of guy and gang.  But dad happens to be available and puts his ""special skills"" to work, becoming a sudden superhero, in a blur of brutal violence, questionable methods to put it mildly, and an entry into the underworld of modern slavery and prostitution.  This section is better, if you are looking for an action film with a lone good guy fighting packs of baddies.  I enjoyed this part more, though wondered about the PG-13 rating.  It is raw, ugly, and full of blatant stereotypes.  That he rescues her - miraculously not violated or even deflowered, but right at the moment a fat ugly sheik is about to have his way with her - is to be expected.

Clearly, James Bond has nothing on this guy.As action thrillers go, ""Taken"" is considerably less plausible than most (which is saying a great deal), filled as it is with preposterous coincidences and feats of superhuman dexterity, but director Pierre Morel does know how to get the adrenaline pumping - which, let`s face it, is all one really asks for from a high-octane popcorn movie such as this one.To make the movie more ""relatable"" for the audience, screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen have concocted a rather dreadful scenario in which Mills has quit his job and moved to California so he will be able to spend more time with his daughter, only to find that he now has to compete with her gazillionaire step daddy for her attention and affection.  But all that malarkey is done away with in the early stages and - good news for action fans - once the movie hits the throttle, it never lets up.The European tourism industry is bound to take something of a hit with this film - and, seriously, all of this just to get some rich guys laid?

1194701,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B001GCUNYO,Samuel McKewon,"[5, 7]","""Taken"" is essentially two lines of dialogue - ""I will find you. And I will kill you."" - stretched out into a 90-minute film. The speaker of this line finds his man. And, boy, does he kill him. And then he finds more people and kills them, too. And before he found the guy he was looking for in the first place, he found some other guys. Guess what? He killed them.This is not a subtle film. It's not all that bloody, either, this tale of a CIA agent (Liam Neeson) whose estranged daughter (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped by sex trade smugglers, thanks to a PG-13 rating. But nuanced? No. Luc Besson (""The Fifth Element,"" ""The Professional,"" The ""Transporter"" series), who co-wrote the screenplay and more or less breathed life into this thing as producer likes his action scenes big, and his hit men sentimental-yet-efficient.And Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, is certainly that. He's divorced from his wife (Famke Janssen) for logging too many hours in hot zones for the CIA, and since she's remarried to, of course, a billionaire (Xander Berkeley, not the villain, if you're guessing), Bryan has idealized his gangly, selfish daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), and transformed her into his Reason For Living.But Kim cons him into signing a release so she can go to Paris with her slightly older, sluttier friend. It's only Bryan's zeal for worrying about every little detail - she forgets to call him upon landing in France, so he calls her - that allows him to hear his daughter getting kidnapped by Albanian slave traders.Inexplicably, her kidnapper picks up the phone. That's enough for Brian and his connections at the CIA to start the manhunt.The second and third acts of ""Taken"" are, frankly, one mass killing after another, each unlikelier than the last. In the background, we see the pale, starving figures - some alive, some not - of other kidnapped girls. At one point, Bryan looks for his daughter in what appears to be a giant Port-A-Potty divided into tiny rooms by cloth curtains with a bed, a slave and a client in each. Bryan eventually finds the Albanians' home base, which is a hive of, well, drugged-out women and presumed venereal disease.The movie is structured almost like a video game, with a number of bosses to kill and levels to complete. Brian's most daunting challenges lie in the bowels of a Paris brownstone at a million-dollar auction and aboard a ship headed for the Middle East. Whether Maggie is there, and whether he saves her, I'll let the film reveal.Let it be said that Maggie Grace, a veteran of the ""Lost"" TV series, was 25 years old when she filmed the movie. She's lost any useful clue on how to play an innocent 17-year-old, and thus turns in one of the more embarrassing performances of the year. There is a way to pout - Kim is required to do it in just about every scene - and a way not to, and it's a mark of Grace's inelegance that she never carves out an ounce of chemistry with Neeson, whose Bryan is risking more than his life, his moral compass and years in prison to save her.  And, unfortunately, she is also not cute, as a scene near the end so drastically points out. You'll know the one, and you'll be asking yourself, ""Her?""Neeson slips nicely into the role once given to Harrison Ford. His Bryan is sharp and ruthless, and the movie's key ""find you/kill you"" monologue is delivered with menace and precision. You'll want to watch it twice. Janssen and Berkeley have bit roles, as does the excellent Leland Orser as one of Brian's CIA buddies.A subplot involving a pop singer is so extraneous and unnecessary that I think it exists to be extraneous and unnecessary, as if to show the audience a modicum of 1980s decency. Everything in ""Taken"" - the Eurotrash baddies, the body count, the ""heart's on fire"" hero of steely resolve but pudding heart - feels stolen from 1986.

It was intriguing from the standpoint as a ""what if"", that the kidnappers made the mistake of stealing someone's daughter whose father is an extremely dangerous and capable ex-spy. A man who will be ""a nightmare"" to the kidnappers. Someone with the experience, know how and total lack of conscience when it comes to dealing with people like the kidnappers. He is willing to break all the rules to get his daughter back. And becomes vindicated to both his daughter, his ex-wife and her husband as being someone of value.I was surprised at the choice of Liam Neeson as the lead but he did an excellent job as the ex-spy father. One can imagine what it would be like to have a child kidnapped. What would you do, especially knowing the odds would be against survival. But to have the tools that Neeson does as an ex-spy, it becomes intriguing to watch him use those tools and the extent he will go and having the capability to go there.I looked at some of the negative reviews to see if there is something I can convey that would help someone to avoid this type of movie. If you do not believe that there are in fact, people of extraordinary skills when it comes to killing, accepting pain and surviving then skip this movie.

1194709,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B001GCUNYO,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[1, 1]","I was working in Paris in 2007 at the American Embassy, and when I was leaving work one day during the summer...I happened to bump into Liam Neeson, and paid him a compliment on ""Batman Begins"".  He was very nice, and actually struck up a short conversation.  I asked him what he was doing here, and he said that he was working on a movie called...yep--""Taken"".I remembered that about seven months later, when this movie premiered in France (I don't believe that it reached the States until almost a year later).  In many ways, the story has been redone in many different forms--Mel Gibson's ""Ransom"" in the '90s; I even believe there was a George C. Scott variation in the late 1970s.Lack of originality does not go hand-in-hand with lack of entertainment, however.  If you combine Luc Beeson's knack for high-adrenaline action with Neeson, who is a LONG human being (IMDB lists him at 6'5""--I think they're a couple of inches SHORT) who certainly hasn't been afraid of taking big dramas (Schindler's List) or over-the-top action (Darkman, of course)...and the mix ends up pretty good.Neeson pretty much carries the film.  Love Maggie Grace as the daughter Neeson's Bryan Mills wishes to establish a relationship with, Famke Janssen--looking slightly older, but still a knockout--as the ex-wife who wishes the ex-husband would go away...until the daughter gets kidnapped in Paris; Xander Berkeley as the richer, more stable second husband who GETS OUT OF THE WAY when Neeson's Brian Mills goes on the warpath; Leland Orser and Jon Gries as coworkers in Mills' former life...But this is Neeson's film from the start, and he gives many sides to Bryan--the father who never forgets his daughter's birthday or misses an opportunity for her to pursue her chance to sing, the estranged ex-husband, the ""preventer"" when working in a bodyguard team for a singer (nice quick turn there, Holly Valance), the badgered male when the daughter wants to go to Paris--and the mother browbeats him into signing off on it...and last but not least, the ex-covert operations operative that goes medevial when his daughter is kidnapped by white slavers in Paris.  The movie's catch phrase--the whole line that Neeson delivers leading up to the ""I will find you, and I will kill you"" line is, in many ways, the early 21st century equivalent to Clint Eastwood's ""Do you feel lucky?  Well, do you...PUNK??!?"" speech from ""Dirty Harry"".Sure, the premise isn't original; and the characterizations are sort of staid.  But Neeson carries this movie, both with his emotional input and his physical presence.  Combine it with Beeson's take on action in movies...and we end up with a pretty good ninety minutes.  Highly recommended.",5,"Taken--For the Action, For Liam...Yeah, It Works...",1307404800,"06 7, 2011",2011,2702,"['was', 'working', 'Paris', '2007', 'American', 'Embassy', 'when', 'was', 'leaving', 'work', 'one', 'day', 'summer', 'happened', 'bump', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'paid', 'compliment', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'actually', 'struck', 'up', 'short', 'conversation', 'asked', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'here', 'said', 'was', 'working', 'movie', 'called', 'yep', 'Taken', '.I', 'remembered', 'seven', 'months', 'later', 'when', 'movie', 'premiered', 'France', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'reached', 'States', 'almost', 'year', 'later', 'many', 'ways', 'story', 'been', 'redone', 'many', 'different', 'forms', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Ransom', ""'90s"", 'even', 'believe', 'was', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'variation', 'late', '1970s.Lack', 'originality', 'not', 'go', 'hand-in-hand', 'lack', 'entertainment', 'however', 'combine', 'Luc', 'Beeson', 'knack', 'high-adrenaline', 'action', 'Neeson', 'who', 'LONG', 'human', 'being', 'IMDB', '6', '5', 'think', ""'re"", 'couple', 'inches', 'SHORT', 'who', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'been', 'afraid', 'taking', 'big', 'dramas', 'Schindler', 'List', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'Darkman', 'course', 'mix', 'up', 'pretty', 'good.Neeson', 'pretty', 'much', 'film', 'Love', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'daughter', 'Neeson', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'establish', 'relationship', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'looking', 'slightly', 'older', 'still', 'knockout', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'ex-husband', 'would', 'go', 'away', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'Paris', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'richer', 'more', 'stable', 'second', 'husband', 'who', 'OUT', 'THE', 'WAY', 'when', 'Neeson', 'Brian', 'Mills', 'warpath', 'Leland', 'Orser', 'Jon', 'Gries', 'coworkers', 'Mills', 'former', 'life', 'Neeson', 'film', 'start', 'many', 'sides', 'Bryan', 'father', 'who', 'never', 'daughter', 'birthday', 'opportunity', 'pursue', 'chance', 'sing', 'estranged', 'ex-husband', 'preventer', 'when', 'working', 'bodyguard', 'team', 'singer', 'nice', 'quick', 'turn', 'there', 'Holly', 'Valance', 'badgered', 'male', 'when', 'daughter', 'go', 'Paris', 'mother', 'signing', 'off', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'ex-covert', 'operations', 'operative', 'medevial', 'when', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'white', 'slavers', 'Paris', 'movie', 'catch', 'phrase', 'whole', 'line', 'Neeson', 'delivers', 'leading', 'up', 'will', 'find', 'will', 'kill', 'line', 'many', 'ways', 'early', '21st', 'century', 'equivalent', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Do', 'feel', 'lucky', 'Well', 'do', 'PUNK', 'speech', 'Dirty', 'Harry', '.Sure', 'premise', ""n't"", 'original', 'characterizations', 'are', 'sort', 'staid', 'Neeson', 'movie', 'emotional', 'input', 'physical', 'presence', 'Combine', 'Beeson', 'take', 'action', 'movies', 'end', 'up', 'pretty', 'good', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Taken

1194711,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B001GCUNYO,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 1]","Liam Neeson shares a trait that all great actors possess - they can do something completely ridiculous and remain entirely believable.  If you're watching Patrick Stewart play Jean-Luc Picard on ""Star Trek - Next Generation,"" you're watching an actual Star Fleet captain rather than a ham actor over-acting on a cheesy set.  If you're watching Sigourney Weaver in ""Alien,"" you're watching Ripley take on the universe's most dangerous monster rather than an actress dancing with a rubber suit.  If you're watching Meryl Streep in ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" you're watching an egotistical editor of a fashion magazine, not a drama queen emoting for effect.From ""Darkman"" to ""Star Wars"" to ""Taken,"" Neeson has always remained believable and compelling no matter how ridiculous his surroundings or god-awful the dialogue.In ""Taken,"" we have to believe that Bryan Mills (Neeson) is a lethal espionage/security guy, one of the best in the world, whose dedication to the job cost him his family.  Too late, he realized his error and quit so he can live in unemployed drudgery and snatch a few moments here and there with his cherished daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace).  Bryan's ex, Lenore (Famke Jannsen, in a thankless role), has custody of Kim and has remarried a sugar daddy who is actually a better person than Lenore.  Kim desperately pleads with Bryan to let her go to Paris with her friend Amanda to tour museums.  Bryan reluctantly consents, going against his better instincts that his 17-year old baby is going to a dangerous place and is not ready for it.Unfortunately, Bryan is right - within minutes of landing in Paris, things go horribly, horribly wrong.  If you saw the trailer for ""Taken,"" you know that the movie is about Bryan's hunt for Kim across the Parisian underworld.This is where ""Taken"" takes flight in a ""Bourne Ultimatum"" kind of way.  There is virtually no character development - the question is whose arm Bryan will break (or worse) as he hunts for his daughter, and how efficiently he'll do it.  Like Jason Bourne, Bryan Mills is not an acrobatic martial artist who will jump, twirl, and kick for dramatic effect - he'll rip your ears off and snap your legs with economic fury.  He's not doing it to be cool.  He's doing what he needs to do to get his daughter back.Woe betide any man or woman who gets in his way.  ""Taken"" strings together a preposterous chain of events that could never happen in a gazillion years, but you won't have time to figure that out until after the movie is over.  For 90-odd minutes, you'll be taken on a compelling thrill ride, courtesy of Neeson and team.Full disclosure - while this movie owes an obvious debt to the ""Bourne"" franchise as far as the feel and look of the film is concerned, it is considerably darker in both subject matter and tone.

Finally after some Steven Segal-type battles, Bryan Mills gets to rescue his daughter and they go back to America safe and sound.If you like action movies, this Liam Neeson movie can fill your collection.In a sense, this movie reminds me of ""Death Sentence"", starring Kevin Bacon.In ""Death Sentence"", the cops are also so useless that the victim's father has to find justice on his own.Recommended viewing:Rambo - The Complete Collector's Set (First Blood - Ultimate Edition / Rambo - First Blood Part II - Ultimate Edition / Rambo III - Ultimate Edition / John Rambo - Special Edition)The Punisher (Extended Cut)Punisher: War Zone (Two-Disc Special Edition)DEATH WISHDeath Sentence (Unrated Edition)",4,A courageous rescue mission,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,1790,"['5', 'stars', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'minus', '1', 'star', 'allowing', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'off', 'so', 'easily', 'Yes', 'read', 'right', 'bad', 'guys', 'got', 'off', 'too', 'easily', 'serious', 'movie', 'serious', 'real-world', 'subject', 'Why', 'spend', 'less', '5', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'playing', 'Marko', 'kidnapper', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'retired', 'CIA', 'officer', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'who', 'single-handedly', 'up', 'minor', 'storm', 'France', 'trying', 'find', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'girl', 'loser', 'female', 'friend', 'got', 'kidnapped', 'human', 'traffickers', 'preparing', 'follow', 'U2', 'band', 'European', 'tour', 'touching', 'down', 'France', 'girls', 'were', 'befriended', 'handsome', 'local', 'male', 'Unknown', 'guy', 'Peter', 'was', 'league', 'human', 'trafficking', 'ring', 'Suspense', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'follow', 'moment', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'down', 'kidnappers', 'trails', 'leaving', 'accidental', 'corpses', 'bad', 'guys', 'here', 'there', 'crooked', 'French', 'cops', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Mills', 'running', 'loose', 'city', 'Paris', 'man', 'got', 'do', 'what', 'got', 'do', 'especially', 'local', 'cops', 'are', 'so', 'useless', 'Finally', 'Steven', 'Segal-type', 'battles', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'rescue', 'daughter', 'go', 'back', 'America', 'safe', 'sound.If', 'action', 'movies', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'movie', 'can', 'fill', 'collection.In', 'sense', 'movie', 'Death', 'Sentence', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Bacon.In', 'Death', 'Sentence', 'cops', 'are', 'also', 'so', 'useless', 'victim', 'father', 'find', 'justice', 'own.Recommended', 'viewing', 'Rambo', 'Complete', 'Collector', 'Set', 'First', 'Blood', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', '/', 'Rambo', 'First', 'Blood', 'Part', 'II', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', '/', 'Rambo', 'III', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', '/', 'John', 'Rambo', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Punisher', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DEATH', 'WISHDeath', 'Sentence', 'Unrated', 'Edition']",Taken

The reason I've gone down the middle of the road with my rating is because of the poor transfer. When I buy Blu-ray I tend to expect a great picture. Taken has a little too much grain through most of the movie with the worst scenes being low-light situations (especially right after the construction site scene: at this point it looks like the movie was projected onto a rough tweed backdrop). If the filmmakers did this for effect it was a bad move because it takes me right out of the movie and gets me thinking about stupid things like transfers...

In a world overcrowded and over-saturated with action films, ""Taken"" may appear to be simply another ""run of the mill"" style of films found within the genre.  However, this assumption couldn't be any more wrong.  The truth is that ""Taken"" is a truly deep, emotional, and inspiring film that depicts what one man is willing to risk, and do, in order to save the ones he loves.  The story is well developed, and the characters are easily likable, making the film that much more enjoyable.The film revolves around the tale of ex CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) who is currently working as a security guard for a major musical star by the name of Sheerah, a pop star singing young woman.  Taken as a joke, initially, by the woman, Bryan quickly redeems himself after fending off a would be assailant who attempted to assault Sheerah with a knife after her performance.  To thank Bryan for his help, Sheerah agrees to assist Bryan's daughter Kim in vocal lessons.  However, when Bryan attempts to tell his daughter of the good news, he is never given the chance to speak since Kim is more excited about the idea of her and her friend Amanda traveling to Paris.Reluctant at first, Bryan agrees to let his daughter leave, under the circumstances that she contacts him as soon she gets there.  Breaking her promise, Kim does not call her father upon arrival in Paris, but instead her and Amanda decide to go get ready for a party that a young man just told them about.  Kim gets a call from her father who is angry that she did not call him back, in the midst of their conversation, Kim witnesses Amanda being kidnapped from within the house.  Bryan walks Kim through the steps to try to stay safe, but ultimately he realizes that the kidnappers are going to get her no matter what.  Before she is taken, he tells her to shout out as many details about the men's appearance as she can.Bryan tells the men that he will find them, and that he will kill them, and using his skills he has acquired from the CIA, he does just that.  Despite being hundred of miles away, Bryan is capable of piecing together pieces of the crime, establishing a trail to the men responsible for the kidnapping.  The film depicts all of the actions that Bryan must undergo in order to save his daughter.  Using his talents in the field of investigation,  he learns the reasoning behind his daughter's abduction, as well as the source.  He learns that due to the circumstances, he only has a few hours to retrieve his daughter, this quickly turns the film into a race against the clock, as Bryan only has a few hours left to save his daughter, or risk never seeing her again.The film's story is deep and emotional, allowing the audience to feel Bryan's pain and suffering and his pure devotion for his daughter Kim.  His actions make the film a truly amazing action movie, utilizing hand to hand combat as well as weapons to overcome obstacles, yet never feeling too over the top, but rather sticking to more believable acts of human strength.  Utilizing stealth, and cunning and well thought out plans, Bryan is capable of overpowering his enemies at every turn, even when things look extremely grim for the man.  ""Taken"" is a film that shows the power of love, the determination of a father, yet still contains the necessary formula and scenes that are required to make a great action flick.  Rather than sinking as low as other action movies that rely more on action sequences and less on storyline, ""Taken"" finds a great balance, making the film truly worth watching.",5,Spectacular Action Flick with Emotion and Substance,1287964800,"10 25, 2010",2010,3590,"['rare', 'find', 'film', 'Taken', 'world', 'overcrowded', 'over-saturated', 'action', 'films', 'Taken', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'simply', 'run', 'mill', 'style', 'films', 'found', 'genre', 'However', 'assumption', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'wrong', 'truth', 'Taken', 'truly', 'deep', 'emotional', 'inspiring', 'film', 'what', 'one', 'man', 'willing', 'risk', 'do', 'order', 'save', 'ones', 'story', 'well', 'developed', 'characters', 'are', 'easily', 'likable', 'making', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'tale', 'ex', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'currently', 'working', 'security', 'guard', 'major', 'musical', 'star', 'name', 'Sheerah', 'pop', 'star', 'singing', 'young', 'woman', 'Taken', 'joke', 'initially', 'woman', 'Bryan', 'quickly', 'fending', 'off', 'would', 'be', 'assailant', 'who', 'attempted', 'assault', 'Sheerah', 'knife', 'performance', 'thank', 'Bryan', 'help', 'Sheerah', 'assist', 'Bryan', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'vocal', 'lessons', 'However', 'when', 'Bryan', 'tell', 'daughter', 'good', 'news', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'speak', 'Kim', 'more', 'excited', 'idea', 'friend', 'Amanda', 'traveling', 'Paris.Reluctant', 'first', 'Bryan', 'let', 'daughter', 'leave', 'circumstances', 'soon', 'there', 'Breaking', 'promise', 'Kim', 'not', 'call', 'father', 'arrival', 'Paris', 'instead', 'Amanda', 'decide', 'go', 'get', 'ready', 'party', 'young', 'man', 'just', 'told', 'Kim', 'call', 'father', 'who', 'angry', 'did', 'not', 'call', 'back', 'midst', 'conversation', 'Kim', 'Amanda', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'house', 'Bryan', 'walks', 'Kim', 'steps', 'try', 'stay', 'safe', 'ultimately', 'kidnappers', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'matter', 'what', 'taken', 'shout', 'out', 'many', 'details', 'men', 'appearance', 'men', 'will', 'find', 'will', 'kill', 'using', 'skills', 'acquired', 'CIA', 'just', 'being', 'hundred', 'miles', 'away', 'Bryan', 'capable', 'piecing', 'together', 'pieces', 'crime', 'establishing', 'trail', 'men', 'responsible', 'kidnapping', 'film', 'actions', 'Bryan', 'must', 'undergo', 'order', 'save', 'daughter', 'Using', 'talents', 'field', 'investigation', 'reasoning', 'daughter', 'abduction', 'as', 'well', 'source', 'due', 'circumstances', 'only', 'few', 'hours', 'retrieve', 'daughter', 'quickly', 'film', 'race', 'clock', 'Bryan', 'only', 'few', 'hours', 'left', 'save', 'daughter', 'risk', 'never', 'seeing', 'again.The', 'film', 'story', 'deep', 'emotional', 'allowing', 'audience', 'feel', 'Bryan', 'pain', 'suffering', 'pure', 'devotion', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'actions', 'make', 'film', 'truly', 'amazing', 'action', 'movie', 'utilizing', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'as', 'well', 'weapons', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'yet', 'never', 'feeling', 'too', 'top', 'rather', 'sticking', 'more', 'believable', 'acts', 'human', 'strength', 'Utilizing', 'stealth', 'cunning', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'plans', 'Bryan', 'capable', 'overpowering', 'enemies', 'turn', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'look', 'extremely', 'grim', 'man', 'Taken', 'film', 'power', 'love', 'determination', 'father', 'yet', 'still', 'necessary', 'formula', 'scenes', 'are', 'required', 'make', 'great', 'action', 'flick', 'Rather', 'sinking', 'as', 'low', 'other', 'action', 'movies', 'rely', 'more', 'action', 'sequences', 'less', 'storyline', 'Taken', 'great', 'balance', 'making', 'film', 'truly', 'worth', 'watching']",Taken

Bryan Mills'(Neeson's) teenaged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) travels to Europe where she is stolen and sold into the sex trade.  The film was rated PG-13 but its content, vaguely glossed over for the most part, is anything but.  Quite graphic, the film relies on assumption, bloodless gunfire, and knife fights to push home the point that some people will justify any action to make money. The light treatment of such a horrific crime is somewhat an insult to the film's message. Given its themes the film would have been stronger if it had gone with an R rating, or at least more artfully hinted around disturbing content.  As it was it fell flat in engaging the audience into exactly what was going on, choosing to focus on pyrotechnics and paramilitary posturing.Neeson is not on his game in this role, though he delivers a powerful, decisive father whose drive to save his daughter rivals the darkness of those he pursues.  This is the real story.  What is happening to his daughter is an afterthought, as is his own emotional involvement with what's happening.  That lack is why the feasibility of the story falls apart.  Grace portrays seventeen-year-old Kim more as if she was fourteen, rarely taking a step that she isn't skipping and pouncing like a puppy.  The need to convey her as being innocent and naive is overdone.  The only thing missing was pigtails.  Between the vague content and the over-acted archetypes of powerful father and innocent daughter, the result is this film turns a traumatic experience into an action-oriented thriller, his daughter's story largely lost beside his campaign for conquest.",3,Telling water not to be wet,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,1699,"['plot', 'film', 'third', 'person', 'sanitized', 'version', 'Lilja', '4-ever', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'Neeson', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'Europe', 'where', 'stolen', 'sold', 'sex', 'trade', 'film', 'was', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'content', 'vaguely', 'glossed', 'most', 'part', 'anything', 'Quite', 'graphic', 'film', 'relies', 'assumption', 'bloodless', 'gunfire', 'knife', 'fights', 'push', 'home', 'point', 'people', 'will', 'justify', 'action', 'make', 'money', 'light', 'treatment', 'such', 'horrific', 'crime', 'somewhat', 'insult', 'film', 'message', 'Given', 'themes', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'had', 'gone', 'R', 'rating', 'least', 'more', 'artfully', 'hinted', 'disturbing', 'content', 'was', 'fell', 'flat', 'engaging', 'audience', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'choosing', 'focus', 'pyrotechnics', 'paramilitary', 'posturing.Neeson', 'not', 'game', 'role', 'powerful', 'decisive', 'father', 'drive', 'save', 'daughter', 'darkness', 'real', 'story', 'What', 'happening', 'daughter', 'afterthought', 'own', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'what', 'happening', 'lack', 'why', 'feasibility', 'story', 'apart', 'Grace', 'seventeen-year-old', 'Kim', 'more', 'was', 'fourteen', 'rarely', 'taking', 'step', ""n't"", 'skipping', 'pouncing', 'puppy', 'need', 'convey', 'being', 'innocent', 'naive', 'overdone', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'was', 'pigtails', 'vague', 'content', 'over-acted', 'archetypes', 'powerful', 'father', 'innocent', 'daughter', 'result', 'film', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'action-oriented', 'thriller', 'daughter', 'story', 'largely', 'lost', 'beside', 'campaign', 'conquest']",Taken

Morales,"[0, 0]","'Taken' was originally advertised as a sort of mystery thriller about a kidnapped girl and a father who is out to rescue her, similar to Mel Gibson's 'Ransom' from over a decade ago. First thing's first - this is NOT that type of movie, and that probably is a good thing, as the advertising was genius as it seemed to draw just as many women as men, yet in the end, it would be the men that would be most satisfied.'Taken' is really your run-of-the-mill action movie, starring Liam Neeson in an pretty standard performance as an ex-CIA father who let's his somewhat shy, pretty and fairly dorky 17 year old daughter take a vacation to Paris (played by Maggie Grace who by the way puts on a very adorable performance), yet upon arrival his daughter gets kidnapped by a gang of sex-trafficking hoodlums. Neeson's characters knows this during a pretty intense, well shot and greatly written scene as he talks on the phone to his daughter as she is being kidnapped, then boldly utters the movie's tagline: ""I will find you, and I will kill you."" Up to this point, all performances are fairly stale, especially Neeson's, but what Neeson lacks in character drama he COMPLETELY makes up for as a one-man Rambo martial arts action hero. It's surprising to see someone of his age basically go all around Paris beating the living snot out of just about everyone. And I do mean everyone.There really is no sense of mystery or intrigue as the plot is pretty straightforward and linear (to a sometimes disappointing degree), but through the good cinematography work and talented editing, it makes this physically appear more intelligent than it actually is (at only a 90 minute length, do not expect anything epic). There were some good opportunities for good plot twists that were never taken advantage of in any way, and although this is somewhat disappointing watching the film as a critic, the action, fighting, fast cars and Liam's completely bold, relentless, almost completely inhuman I-will-do-ANYTHING-to-get-my-daughter no-nonsense character will probably turn you off as much as it turns you on. He doesn't care about being a hero, he hurts and kills ANYONE who will get in his way, and the average macho-rebel wannabe will love every second of it.Personally, I found this movie to be incredibly entertaining, and while you don't need much intelligence to watch this movie (even though at the outset it seems you will), it really doesn't matter, the bottom line is you'll be entertained just as I was. This is one of those movie's perfect for a Friday night with friends or family (well, those over 14 as there are some fairly sexually graphic scenes of kidnapped, drugged and sex-trafficked young women and men taking advantage of the, minus any nudity though, but it does come fairly close at a couple of points), it's also a movie that can be watched over and over again.

There are also a few plot twists along the way that keep things interesting.  The only thing that I didn't care for was the fact that Neeson was cast as an American and so had to lose his Irish accent.  They could have had him play an ex-MI5 agent who had married and moved to the USA etc. to explain his accent.  Nevertheless, its still worthy of a 5-star rating.

1194737,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B001GCUNYO,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","Do you remember the middle of the last decade, when we good Americans were all down on the French and when Bill O'Reilly vowed to drink no more Cotes-du-Rhone and eat no more brie?  The days of ""freedom fries,"" in fact?  From that era (2006-07), here's a movie that shows us a real American -- willing to kill, maim, and torture in order to protect his 17-year-old baby girl.  Of course, he's played by an Irish actor, but let's forget that for the moment.  And at the beginning of the movie, we learn that his shallow wife has divorced him (he had been spending too much time protecting his country, presumably also killing, maiming, and torturing, because he's awfully good at these kinds of things), and now he has retired in order to try to maintain some contact with his daughter.  His daughter, who has clearly taken on the shallow values of her mother and stepfather, wants to go to Paris with a friend, but that turns out to be a lie.  She doesn't tell her dad that she really wants to follow U-2 around Europe because she knows that her dad won't sign the permission papers for that.  Hell, Dad doesn't feel real good about signing the permission paper for Paris.  But Mom is all for it, and Dad gives in and signs, even though he has a bad feeling about it.  Then on the very first afternoon in Paris, she's kidnapped and is about to be sold into what used to be called ""white slavery"" by a bunch of Albanians.Dad is Liam Neeson, and he's a very competent killer, formerly employed by the US Government on matters of national security.  He has recently retired, so his skills have not atrophied.  He can avoid hails of AK-47 bullets, while dispatching his pursuers with well-placed single shots, and he can drive a car at speed the wrong way on Paris's one-way-streets like nobody's business.  By the time he gets on to the boat on the Seine where is daughter is being held, we know that the 10 or 12 men on the boat are as good as dead -- and very soon they are.This is one of these movies where style or presentation trumps moral judgment.  You can't fault the pacing or the production values, and the visceral excitement of the chases and the fights tends to distract us from the fact that this a man who will torture and who is willing to kill even innocent people to do what has to be, in his view, done.  There's no remorse, no second guessing, no weighing the cost to his soul.  At the end, returning his daughter to the shallow mother, he seems untroubled by the whole experience, and his daughter seems remarkably untraumatized too: they haven't counted the cost -- because the genre of the movie won't let them -- to others or to themselves.  Liam is so untroubled that he doesn't even say to his ex-wife, ""I told you so"" -- so, you see, he IS capable of restraint.  He's not a monster. . .This is a cynical and dishonest movie, pandering to the most dubious instincts of its historical moment.  Dick Cheney would have loved it, and maybe even Bill O'Reilly  . . . except that the director is FRENCH, for heaven's sake!  And the French in the movie are incompetent and corrupt, mere bureaucrats and not real soldiers for freedom.  But the French director and backers of this movie were savvy and cynical enough to know that a movie that ran down their own country might make a boatload of money in the States.  And so it did.NOTE: My daughter had another reservation:  Neeson's character's total lack of interest in the other girls who have been put in his daughter's position.  He helps one, but only because he thinks she knows where his daughter is.  What about the rest?  After all, are these sloppy and corrupt French really going to make sure that they're OK . . .

1194741,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B001GCUNYO,Steve Douglas,"[10, 12]","I find it amazing that you have to scroll through so many pages here to find anyone who is reviewing the blu ray disc and when they do, they just say that it was exciting and that they liked it.  Sorry, that is not a review. Once again, with Amazon's now downloadable viewing there is no separation of reviews of the downloaded versions, which are highly compressed, the standard def versions, and the blu ray versions.  Amazon would do us all a huge service by separating these 3 different formats of viewing.I don't give plot summaries or my opinions of the movies, the acting or any of that nonsense. If I didn't initially like a movie, I certainly wouldn't bother to buy it.  I will admit that when I first saw the film, my only complaint was that it was too short.Thus, this review focuses, as do all my reviews, only on the quality of the transfer to blu ray itself.The audio is DTS HD 5.1 and makes good use of the front sound stage with appropriate panning across the screen.  Not a whole lot for the rear channels in terms of discreet channeling as they are mostly used for ambient sound but not necessarily discreet foley effects.  There are many scenes where the rears could easily have been used for such but this is typical of theatrical releases who are stingy with their audio budgets.  Even an old movie like 'Air Force One' made great use of the rear channels so ' Taken' certainly could have.The video transfer is good.  Not great.  No grain, artifacts or any image issues and there are details in the shadows.  However, the overall color images are rather soft when, in many places, they really could and should have stood out more.

I don't believe that, if you already have the 2 disc version on Standard Def DVDs, that you will notice a truly significant enhancement between the two.

The quality of the Blu had loads of opportunity to fail with all of the close quarter hand to hand and nighttime action, but they did quite well. There is some hints of grain here and there but it seemed relevant to the scene. Otherwise - a nice transfer. The DTS was superb and bolstered Liam's resounding voice properly. The outer channels did not get used as much as I had hoped, but fortunately they did not score this film where voices and action get drowned out.Now for the fun stuff. I watched the extended version (1:33:25 vs. 1:30:55 on the rated) and turned on the Black Ops option. Two things occur here: 1. A semi-decent trivia track that provides some relevant facts regarding human trafficking and 2. A body count meter, time remaining watch (the 96 hour window) and a miles traveled listing. I loved it. This option finally answered those nagging questions (in an action movie like this) of did that bad guy really die or not, or is he coming back to wreak havoc. For instance, when a car crashes did it really kill every bad guy in the back seat or are they coming back in the next scene - killed meter clicks up 2 spots - answer is no. Spoiler: final count 33 dead, 13 wounded, 12K miles traveled in exactly 96 hours. The only drawback is it removed the subtitles to play the tracks, so you lose all of the French conversation translations. Most of the rated/unrated version differences are towards the latter half of the film (violent half) as at 41 minutes there was only a nine second variance.2 of the commentary tracks are exclusive to the unrated, the side by side documentary provides comparison on the actual shooting stock to the final film cut, a 20 minute making-of provides some nice insight, but then I was hit with a rare emotional moment on a BD supplement. There was a nice film premiere documentary with interviews of cast and crew on the carpet, but most noticeably some very touching footage of Natasha and Liam. Some brief but genuine moments that speak for themselves.An incredibly worthwhile Blu to own, and I rank Liam's performance as a believable action star right at the top.",5,"Great film, great Blu Ray, 5+ stars",1241827200,"05 9, 2009",2009,2382,"['title', 'won', 'one', 'best', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'have', 'encountered', 'Blu', 'was', 'awesome', 'film.I', 'have', 'read', 'plethora', 'reviews', 'covering', 'story', 'honestly', 'simple', 'enough', 'dad', 'looking', 'rescue', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'quality', 'Blu', 'had', 'loads', 'opportunity', 'fail', 'close', 'quarter', 'hand', 'hand', 'nighttime', 'action', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'hints', 'grain', 'here', 'there', 'seemed', 'relevant', 'scene', 'Otherwise', 'nice', 'transfer', 'DTS', 'was', 'superb', 'bolstered', 'Liam', 'resounding', 'voice', 'properly', 'outer', 'channels', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'used', 'as', 'much', 'had', 'hoped', 'fortunately', 'did', 'not', 'score', 'film', 'where', 'voices', 'action', 'get', 'drowned', 'out.Now', 'fun', 'stuff', 'watched', 'extended', 'version', '1:33:25', 'vs.', '1:30:55', 'rated', 'turned', 'Black', 'Ops', 'option', 'Two', 'things', 'occur', 'here', '1', 'semi-decent', 'trivia', 'track', 'relevant', 'facts', 'regarding', 'human', 'trafficking', '2', 'body', 'count', 'meter', 'time', 'remaining', 'watch', '96', 'hour', 'window', 'miles', 'traveled', 'listing', 'loved', 'option', 'finally', 'answered', 'nagging', 'questions', 'action', 'movie', 'did', 'bad', 'guy', 'really', 'die', 'not', 'coming', 'back', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'instance', 'when', 'car', 'crashes', 'did', 'really', 'kill', 'bad', 'guy', 'back', 'seat', 'are', 'coming', 'back', 'next', 'scene', 'killed', 'meter', 'up', '2', 'spots', 'answer', 'Spoiler', 'final', 'count', '33', 'dead', '13', 'wounded', '12K', 'miles', 'traveled', 'exactly', '96', 'hours', 'only', 'drawback', 'removed', 'subtitles', 'play', 'tracks', 'lose', 'French', 'conversation', 'translations', 'Most', 'rated/unrated', 'version', 'differences', 'are', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'violent', 'half', '41', 'minutes', 'there', 'was', 'only', 'nine', 'second', 'variance.2', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'exclusive', 'unrated', 'side', 'side', 'documentary', 'comparison', 'actual', 'shooting', 'stock', 'final', 'film', 'cut', '20', 'minute', 'making-of', 'nice', 'insight', 'then', 'was', 'hit', 'rare', 'emotional', 'moment', 'BD', 'supplement', 'was', 'nice', 'film', 'premiere', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'carpet', 'most', 'noticeably', 'very', 'touching', 'footage', 'Natasha', 'Liam', 'brief', 'genuine', 'moments', 'speak', 'themselves.An', 'incredibly', 'worthwhile', 'Blu', 'own', 'rank', 'Liam', 'performance', 'believable', 'action', 'star', 'right', 'top']",Taken
1194744,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B001GCUNYO,Steven Aldersley,"[5, 6]","I'm not a big fan of action movies. They tend to focus on violence and killing as many people as possible in the most original ways, but a select few have more depth. Taken falls into the latter category.Why is it so good?If you had told me that a 56-year-old actor would make one of the best action movies I've ever seen, I would have laughed and thought how bad Roger Moore's version of James Bond was in A View to a Kill and Octopussy. Action movies often feature actors who look the part, but who can't really act. Arnold Schwarzenegger springs to mind. Liam Neeson changes all that with this one performance. He doesn't look like he could take on the world, but his acting ability is so good that he convinces you that he's capable of everything he does in the movie.Bryan Mills (Neeson) used to work for the government as a CIA operative. He still associates with friends from his previous job, but he's given up that career in an attempt to get closer to his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). She lives with his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and her rich stepfather. When Mills takes Kim a thoughtful gift on her seventeenth birthday, her stepfather gives her a horse. Mills doesn't seem to have a chance of winning her respect. What's more, Lenore apparently hates him.Mills is given another chance to make a connection with Kim when she asks him to sign a consent form so that she can leave the country for a vacation. As she's 17, she needs the permission of both parents. Mills isn't happy about the idea. He's seen a lot of criminal activity in his former line of work and understands the dangers involved. Is he just being paranoid? His dire warnings seem exaggerated, but we soon see that they are justified.Kim goes to Paris with her 19-year-old friend and trusts everyone she meets. The day she arrives, an Albanian gang take her and her friend captive. We learn that they intend to control her through drugs and turn her into a prostitute, or perhaps even sell her to a willing buyer.Perhaps the best moment in the movie is when Mills talks to Kim's captor on her phone:""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.""He says it with absolute conviction.I won't give away any more of the story. That setup takes around 25 minutes. If I have done a good job, perhaps you can understand why Taken is different. Mills is real. We understand his motives for giving up his job. When Kim is taken, we start to see some of the skills he claims to possess.If she was your daughter, how would you react? What if you had the requisite skills to seek her out yourself? Is there anything you wouldn't do to save her?Director Pierre Morel doesn't waste a single minute. At 93 minutes, the movie is lean and the action rarely allows us time to breathe once Mills kicks into action. He's a relentless killing machine, but, unlike most action heroes, his abilities seem authentic. To make things seem even more urgent, we experience everything from his point of view. Expect to see plenty of fast cuts during chase scenes, just as you would in The Bourne Trilogy.It's easy to root for Mills because of the strong characterization. Neeson excels in this role and carries the movie throughout. I wonder if we'll start to see other good actors cast in action roles as a result? Taken is an enjoyable thrill ride with almost endless replay value.",5,One of the best action movies I've seen,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,3754,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'action', 'movies', 'tend', 'focus', 'violence', 'killing', 'many', 'people', 'possible', 'most', 'original', 'ways', 'select', 'few', 'have', 'more', 'depth', 'Taken', 'latter', 'category.Why', 'so', 'good', 'had', 'told', '56-year-old', 'actor', 'would', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'would', 'have', 'laughed', 'thought', 'how', 'bad', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'version', 'James', 'Bond', 'was', 'View', 'Kill', 'Octopussy', 'Action', 'movies', 'often', 'feature', 'actors', 'who', 'look', 'part', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'act', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'springs', 'mind', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'one', 'performance', ""n't"", 'look', 'could', 'take', 'world', 'acting', 'ability', 'so', 'good', 'capable', 'everything', 'movie.Bryan', 'Mills', 'Neeson', 'used', 'work', 'government', 'CIA', 'operative', 'still', 'friends', 'previous', 'job', 'given', 'up', 'career', 'attempt', 'get', 'closer', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'ex-wife', 'Lenore', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'rich', 'stepfather', 'When', 'Mills', 'Kim', 'thoughtful', 'gift', 'seventeenth', 'birthday', 'stepfather', 'horse', 'Mills', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'chance', 'winning', 'respect', 'What', 'more', 'Lenore', 'apparently', 'him.Mills', 'given', 'chance', 'make', 'connection', 'Kim', 'when', 'sign', 'consent', 'form', 'can', 'leave', 'country', 'vacation', '17', 'permission', 'parents', 'Mills', ""n't"", 'happy', 'idea', 'seen', 'lot', 'criminal', 'activity', 'former', 'line', 'work', 'dangers', 'involved', 'just', 'being', 'paranoid', 'dire', 'warnings', 'seem', 'exaggerated', 'soon', 'see', 'are', 'justified.Kim', 'Paris', '19-year-old', 'friend', 'trusts', 'everyone', 'day', 'Albanian', 'gang', 'take', 'friend', 'captive', 'learn', 'intend', 'control', 'drugs', 'turn', 'prostitute', 'perhaps', 'even', 'sell', 'willing', 'best', 'moment', 'movie', 'when', 'Mills', 'Kim', 'captor', 'phone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'want', 'are', 'looking', 'ransom', 'can', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'are', 'very', 'particular', 'set', 'skills', 'skills', 'have', 'acquired', 'very', 'long', 'career', 'make', 'nightmare', 'people', 'let', 'daughter', 'go', 'now', ""'ll"", 'be', 'end', 'will', 'not', 'look', 'will', 'not', 'pursue', 'do', ""n't"", 'will', 'look', 'will', 'find', 'will', 'kill', 'absolute', 'conviction.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'story', 'setup', '25', 'minutes', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'perhaps', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Taken', 'different', 'Mills', 'real', 'understand', 'motives', 'giving', 'up', 'job', 'When', 'Kim', 'taken', 'start', 'see', 'skills', 'possess.If', 'was', 'daughter', 'how', 'would', 'react', 'What', 'had', 'requisite', 'skills', 'seek', 'out', 'there', 'anything', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'save', 'Director', 'Pierre', 'Morel', ""n't"", 'waste', 'single', 'minute', '93', 'minutes', 'movie', 'lean', 'action', 'rarely', 'time', 'breathe', 'once', 'Mills', 'action', 'relentless', 'killing', 'machine', 'most', 'action', 'heroes', 'abilities', 'seem', 'authentic', 'make', 'things', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'urgent', 'experience', 'everything', 'point', 'view', 'Expect', 'see', 'plenty', 'fast', 'cuts', 'chase', 'scenes', 'just', 'would', 'Bourne', 'Trilogy.It', 'easy', 'root', 'Mills', 'strong', 'characterization', 'Neeson', 'role', 'movie', 'wonder', ""'ll"", 'start', 'see', 'other', 'good', 'actors', 'cast', 'action', 'roles', 'result', 'Taken', 'enjoyable', 'thrill', 'ride', 'almost', 'endless', 'replay', 'value']",Taken

If you want to start analysing it as if it was an art house film then, of course, you can find fault because clich&eacute;s do abound.  First off there's the air-headed 17 year old daughter, Kim, doted on by the ex-CIA specialist killing machine played efficiently by Neeson, who's been cast aside by the blinkered, indulgent mother, played by Janssen, for the safer and much richer second husband, Xander Berkeley.  Next, Kim decides she wants to do the groupie thing with her equally air-headed mate and troll around Europe after a rock group.  Naturally, doting father, who knows the ways of the world, fiercely objects but dumb mum sees no problem with this - after all, you're only young once!The girls reach Paris safely, the first stop on their tour, but fall foul to the most horrible of scams.  Enter the East European nasties!  This is the bit, of course, that plays in to the most profound of our prejudices about the yellow peril, going back to such pernicious heavies as Dracula himself; the peril from the east!  This time, though, it's not Transylvania getting the bad press but the Albanian mafia, trafficking young women for prostitution, and Kim and her mate fit the bill nicely.  Dad duly brushes the dust from his skill set and proceeds to track down the kidnappers killing anything and everything in his way, with apparent impunity.So what's the problem?  The action is handled brilliantly and, whilst the inevitable fight scenes do stretch the boundaries of probability, the baddies well and truly get their just deserts.  Just think about this: if your daughter was snatched and sold into slavery to be the sex toy for some rich sheik and you were a CIA trained killing machine with powerful financial resources available to you would you let anything stand in your way to rescue her?  Of course not! So the premise is fine: the baddies have to come from somewhere so why not let Albania have its turn; there have been plenty of nasty Brits - think, Die hard?  And as for the many improbabilities - it's fiction for crying out loud: albeit fiction, which has, unfortunately, echoes of the sometimes, very unpleasant real world.

1194754,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B001GCUNYO,susannah,"[2, 3]","This was a pretty good one, though like another poster said, Liam Neeson hasn't done any bad films, IMO. It is satisfying and exciting, especially since all the bad guys are preying on innocent girls. They deserve whatever they get, all of them, only more slowly. As with any kind of ""right vs wrong"" story, I wonder how those who started out as human beings, with hearts and souls, became so devoid of humanity that they would do these horrible things without blinking an eye.The one thing that really really REALLY annoyed me was the exwife. She clearly had her issues with Neeson's character as a husband, and that was fine, but to see her take every opportunity to interfere and take verbal jabs and sabotage his relationship with his daughter was infuriating, as well as really bad parenting. No one in their right mind would just say, ""oh you want to go bebop around Europe alone, with no supervision of any kind? Sure let me sign the permission,"" without even having a moment to think about it. Of course IMO no parent in their right mind would let their teen daughter do it anyway. It seemed as though the exwife was willing to send their daughter into as risky a situation as she could, just to spite Neeson, with his concerns born of knowledge. I wanted her at the end to just say she was wrong, but all she would say was ""bring her back to ME,"" as though Neeson were merely the deliveryman, and had no real emotional stake in it. I thought it was pretty cold of the daughter to leave him alone at the airport as well. It seemed that both parents consisted basically of trying to outdo each other in giving the daughter everything she wanted, not stellar parenting there either.While there was quite a bit of implausibility, the thing that got me was that the rich dudes at the auction would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for sex with a virgin girl? I mean, really? I am no expert on this but it seems to me that that is alot of money for something not that big a deal.

Mills springs into action, and travels to France, where he becomes a one-man wrecking crew bent on finding his daughter and returning her to safety.Neeson handles the action scenes adroitly, and since this is already his territory, Besson and his director, Pierre Morel, produce a high-octane film that is fun, entertaining, and even manages to put a spotlight on a problem that is beginning to draw attention worldwide.In addition to the riveting action, the subleties and no-so subleties of beign a divorced parent on the outside are handled accurately and poignantly.

Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.----------------------------------------**Brief Review**I have loved watching Liam Neeson for some years now.  The man just makes great movies.  Hell, even 'Darkman' is pretty decent.  But he really SHINES in this feature.**Movie Details/Some Spoilers Ahead**The film centers around ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson).  A divorced man trying desperately to form a closer relationship with his daughter.  He ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) has long remarried, to a filthy rich man, and is not that worried about Neeson getting close to his daughter.Well summer comes and Neeson's daughter desperately wants to go to Paris, to ""study"", yeah right...  Neeson must sign a parental consent form for her to leave the country unattended by an adult.  After much goading from Lenore and his daughter he relents.  He soon discovers though that she is actually going to Paris with her friend to follow the band U2 (or maybe it was Blink 182) around Europe.  He is furious about being deceived.Neeson has been around to say the least and knows how dangerous the world actually is.  Well, his daughter is no more than 10 minutes off the plane in Paris when she and her friend are ""marked"" by some flesh peddlers.  These monsters steal women, and auction them off into sexual slavery.  Sad to say this is REAL, and something that the international police forces are trying to desperately combat.As you probably have seen on the movie's trailer, Neeson is on the phone with his daughter when she is kidnapped.  And as you've seen off the commercials ""he has a particular set of skills..."".  He's a badass to say the least.In no time at all Liam's on a plane to Paris ready to kill anyone who is between him and his daughter...--Summing Up--This film is HIGH on the action scale.  It is a tad slow for like the first 15 minutes, but after that never stops.  Plus the acting is superb.  Forget 'Ransom' with Mel Gibson, 'Taken' is the film to see.There are very few people who have not seen this movie.  But if you are amoung the few who missed it, definitely check this out.Is this worth buying.  ABSOLUTELY YES!!!  This is a re-watch times 10.  I have personally watched it apx 3 times, and will no doubt watch it again soon.  In fact just typing this review I am getting the urge to get my copy out and pop it into my aging DVD player.Well, that's my 3 cents worth on this movie.

1194775,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B001GCUNYO,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[23, 31]","""Taken"" combines elements of the James Bond films with the tale of a father's attempt to build a relationship with a daughter for whom he was never there in her younger years.  It is a fast-paced, exciting action thriller made with style and polish.  If analyzed too closely, its preposterous and coincidental events would strain any reasonable credibility.  But never mind.  ""Taken"" is a neat, roller-coaster ride of a flick.Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired from his CIA job and relocated in order to be closer to his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who lives a life of wealth and privilege with her mother (Famke Janssen) and stepfather (Xander Berkeley).  Bryan reluctantly gives his consent for Kim to spend the summer in Paris, on condition she call him every day.At the Paris airport, Kim falls under the charms of a handsome young Frenchman who is actually part of a ring designed to kidnap young, foreign women for sale to Arab sheiks.  Kim is conveniently on the phone with Bryan when the kidnappers arrive.  Bryan immediately contacts his former friends in the CIA to piece together evidence he has culled from the brief phone call, which he had the foresight to record.The balance of the movie follows Bryan as he attempts to track down Kim in Paris.  During his quest, we see that this quiet, soft-spoken man has an entirely different side; he is a highly trained field agent who knows his way around self-defense, weapons, bribery, interrogation, torture, and forgery.  Working mostly alone, he takes on a bevy of bad guys and scurrilous types as he follows the trail to his daughter, dispensing with a good deal of civility along the way.""Taken"" is not a great film, but the kind that draws you in and holds tight for ninety minutes.  Director Pierre Morel has staged some exciting set pieces, a nifty car chase, and explosions, and tossed in a collection of surly thugs and rich, well-dressed villains to spice things up.  We root for Bryan because his use of violence is directed only against those who deserve it.  He is ruthless and doesn't subscribe to the unwritten cinema rule that the good guy must be fair, upright, law-abiding, and moral at every turn no matter how difficult the going gets.  Bryan has no compunctions against knocking off anyone who might have had any part in his daughter's abduction.Neeson is an interesting choice for an action hero.  He looks more like a college professor, and that's the point.  When he springs into action, it is unexpected and his proficiency is startling.  He refers to his former occupation with the government as a ""preventer,"" but it soon becomes clear that his job involved more than polite roundtable diplomacy.  Like Jason Bourne, Bryan thinks in nanoseconds, sizing up his immediate surroundings, assessing the degree of danger he's up against, and determining his offense or defense.  We, the viewers, are often surprised by his swift, efficient moves.Michel Abramowicz's photography enhances the film's action sequences and Frederic Thoraval's editing makes scenes shot piece by piece look seamless.  This is especially evident in fight scenes, which are abundant.It's surprising that ""Taken"" is rated PG-13.  Its violence, sexual content, plot references to drug use, and strong language would seem to justify an R, but strange are the ways of the MPAA.",4,Gripping Thriller With James Bond Flair,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,3333,"['Taken', 'combines', 'elements', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'tale', 'father', 'attempt', 'build', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'whom', 'was', 'never', 'there', 'younger', 'years', 'fast-paced', 'exciting', 'action', 'thriller', 'made', 'style', 'polish', 'analyzed', 'too', 'closely', 'preposterous', 'coincidental', 'events', 'would', 'strain', 'reasonable', 'credibility', 'never', 'mind', 'Taken', 'neat', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'flick.Bryan', 'Mills', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'retired', 'CIA', 'job', 'relocated', 'order', 'be', 'closer', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'who', 'life', 'wealth', 'privilege', 'mother', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'Bryan', 'reluctantly', 'consent', 'Kim', 'spend', 'summer', 'Paris', 'condition', 'call', 'day.At', 'Paris', 'airport', 'Kim', 'charms', 'handsome', 'young', 'Frenchman', 'who', 'actually', 'part', 'ring', 'designed', 'kidnap', 'young', 'foreign', 'women', 'sale', 'Arab', 'sheiks', 'Kim', 'conveniently', 'phone', 'Bryan', 'when', 'kidnappers', 'arrive', 'Bryan', 'immediately', 'former', 'friends', 'CIA', 'piece', 'together', 'evidence', 'culled', 'brief', 'phone', 'call', 'had', 'foresight', 'record.The', 'balance', 'movie', 'Bryan', 'track', 'down', 'Kim', 'Paris', 'quest', 'see', 'quiet', 'soft-spoken', 'man', 'entirely', 'different', 'side', 'highly', 'trained', 'field', 'agent', 'who', 'way', 'self-defense', 'weapons', 'bribery', 'interrogation', 'torture', 'forgery', 'Working', 'mostly', 'alone', 'bevy', 'bad', 'guys', 'scurrilous', 'types', 'trail', 'daughter', 'dispensing', 'good', 'deal', 'civility', 'way', 'Taken', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'kind', 'tight', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'Director', 'Pierre', 'Morel', 'staged', 'exciting', 'set', 'pieces', 'nifty', 'car', 'chase', 'explosions', 'tossed', 'collection', 'surly', 'thugs', 'rich', 'well-dressed', 'villains', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'root', 'Bryan', 'use', 'violence', 'directed', 'only', 'who', 'deserve', 'ruthless', ""n't"", 'subscribe', 'unwritten', 'cinema', 'rule', 'good', 'guy', 'must', 'be', 'fair', 'upright', 'law-abiding', 'moral', 'turn', 'matter', 'how', 'difficult', 'going', 'Bryan', 'compunctions', 'knocking', 'off', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'part', 'daughter', 'abduction.Neeson', 'interesting', 'choice', 'action', 'hero', 'more', 'college', 'professor', 'point', 'When', 'action', 'unexpected', 'proficiency', 'startling', 'former', 'occupation', 'government', 'preventer', 'soon', 'clear', 'job', 'involved', 'more', 'polite', 'roundtable', 'diplomacy', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Bryan', 'nanoseconds', 'sizing', 'up', 'immediate', 'surroundings', 'assessing', 'degree', 'danger', 'up', 'determining', 'offense', 'defense', 'viewers', 'are', 'often', 'surprised', 'swift', 'efficient', 'moves.Michel', 'Abramowicz', 'photography', 'film', 'action', 'sequences', 'Frederic', 'Thoraval', 'editing', 'scenes', 'shot', 'piece', 'piece', 'look', 'seamless', 'especially', 'evident', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'abundant.It', 'surprising', 'Taken', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'sexual', 'content', 'plot', 'references', 'drug', 'use', 'strong', 'language', 'would', 'seem', 'justify', 'R', 'strange', 'are', 'ways', 'MPAA']",Taken
1194776,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B001GCUNYO,The Mysterious Traveler,"[1, 3]","TAKEN (2008) Directed by Pierre Morel.Starring Liam Neeson and Famke Janssen.When a group of Paris based Muslim Barbarian White Slavers kidnap the daughter of a former secret agent of the US govt, he gives them one chance to return her or he will kill them all. The Muslim Barbarians choose unwisely.Some minor observations. It appears, based on this film, that the French are having second thoughts about allowing a horde of savages to take up residence in their country and yet the film portrays these same French being in league with said savages while the film's hero is an American who disregards the French, engages in genuine torture and generally leaves bodies in his wake. It appears the French have some issues to work out.Other than the above, this is a simply wonderful and highly entertaining film, easily one of the best of 2008. Besides the fact that it is extremely well done in almost every respect from an emotionally charged script to a sold cast doing fine work, the film is also quite original and more than a little brave. Not only does it have Muslim Barbarians as villains but they are actually Muslim Barbarians acting LIKE Muslim Barbarians and not the Hug Me Elmos that Hollywood usually churns out. What is more.... this must be the first film about the horrific crime of White Slavery made since...When?? THE MONSTER AND THE GIRL in 1940??? If even half of what this film dramatizes is true then Hollywood should cut it out with the movies about Global Warming fantasies and all the rest of their rubbish and maybe consider a few more on this subject.I was greatly impressed with Neeson's work here and have generally decided that the actor......whom I never liked much.......has truly become great as he has aged. The relationship with his ex-wife played by Janssen and especially his daughter is quite touching and real. The action and suspense are top notch and reminded at times of an old Republic serial. In spite of the violence and the horror of the subject matter, this is still a highly positive and ennobling film and left this viewer thoroughly pleased.

I have tried for a very long time to make my child understand that sexual slavery is alive and well so I don't have to worry *as much* that she will let herself get into a precarious situation. I've recounted numerous real-life human trafficking cases to her, went through the Polaris Project's website with her, showed her FBI statistics which show that selling girls is the 2nd most profitable criminal enterprise in the world (drugs is #1,) and still felt like I was talking to a brick wall. All I got in return were eye-rolls and infamous, I-am-the-invulnerable-teenager quotes like, ""Mom, you worry too much. I'm not stupid and that is soooo not gonna happen to me!""Then we watched TAKEN... finally, finally, finally she is starting to get it!! This movie does an excellent job of showing how quickly traffickers work and how slick they are with little girls. It conveys the terror a girl is engulfed with when she's kidnapped, how easy it is to be kidnapped, the horrible sexual and physical abuse the victim suffers (without actually showing it,) and how the average little girl would never be found because they don't have a former spy (Liam Neeson) for a parent. After watching TAKEN my daughter's entire attitude has changed for the better. She is learning martial arts, staying cognizant of her surroundings, and is also more interested in the real-life cases she didn't want to hear about before. (An excellent non-fiction book to give your teenager to read after viewing this movie isThe Slave Next Door: Human Trafficking and Slavery in America Today, With a New Preface- actually, everyone should read it.)For those not interested in a mom's perspective and are reading reviews for the cinematic experience, TAKEN is a fast-paced thriller that snags your attention and keeps it the whole way through. The only truly unbelievable character in the movie is the mother, Liam Neeson's ex-wife. She's one of those TSTL (Too Stupid To Live) characters that thinks more like a know-it-all 16-year-old girl than a mature, grown woman. Luckily, she's just a side character and not in much of the movie overall.5 stars!

He is a gentle father (and retired special agent) who turns into an invincible war machine that no one can stop. After his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped in the Paris apartment, he flies to France and starts his ""investigation"" on his own.Using the knowledge and skills he had learned in his former career, he chases every suspicious guy and corners him. To save his daughter, he runs and drives in the Paris streets (sometimes in the wrong side of the road); he beats up and shoots anyone who stands in his way. He's got only 96 hours before it is too late, and as I said before, this Jack Bauer-like former spy is played by Liam Neeson.The 55-year-old Oscar-nominee veteran Liam Neeson, whose previous roles include Michael Collins, Alfred Kinsey and Oskar Schindler, is cast against type as the star of this tense action film. He is surprisingly convincing as a vengeful retired agent trying to rescue his daughter. Well, maybe this is not surprising because Liam Neeson is no stranger to action movies, previously seen in such films as ""Darkman"" ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" and ""Batman Begins."" He has worked with Sam Raimi, George Lucas and Christopher Nolan, and this is a quite impressive list.""Taken"" wisely focuses on Liam Neeson's character. His charisma grabs your attention immediately, and with his riveting performances, some nice fights and the slick direction from Pierre Morel (""District B13"") the film is never boring. Supporting actors, however, are unmemorable or just annoying. Famke Janssen as Kim's mother and Bryan's separated wife only stands and looks worried before the camera. Maggie Grace (""LOST"") plays the spoiled daughter Kim, who is so irritating.As far as the major plot holes go, few films can beat ""Taken"" (the script was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, a writing team for three ""Transporter"" films).

1194793,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B001GCUNYO,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 3]","One of the most exciting and interesting movies to be released in the first-half of 2009, TAKEN is a thrilling movie about one father's journey to rescue his daughter from Eastern European kidnappers who intend to sell her as a sex slave to the highest bidder.  Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired CIA special ops man who has recently moved so that he can be closer to his teenage daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) who is living with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and her wealthy stepfather (Xander Berkeley).  Bryan loves his daughter deeply, but feels disconnected from her and because of the posh lifestyle she is currently living. He is concerned that she might be loosing her way.  When Kim is presented with an opportunity to travel with a friend to Paris for the summer, Bryan is against the idea.  His work with the CIA have taught him how dangerous it is for young women to be traveling alone across Europe. Besides that, Kim is underage and her protective mother and stepfather have been overprotective and sheltered her from any knowledge of the real dangers of the world.  However, after being reassured of Kim and her traveling companion, Amanda's (Katie Cassidy), supervision by a family in Paris, that there would not be any globe-trotting alone, and Kim's promise that she would call her father every day, he consents to let her go.  It is only later that he learns the girls aren't going for any sort of educational reason, but to be a band groupie following a particular group on their European tour.  Bryan is furious, but is still trying to reconnect and against his better judgment allows her to go.Upon arriving in Paris, Amanda & Kim are met by a handsome, young Frenchmen who invites them to a party later that night and rides with them to the place where they will be staying.  Kim is a bit unsettled by the many, but Amanda is smitten with lust. Upon arriving at the residence Kim is shocked to discover that Amanda wasn't being completely honest with her either because the family they are to stay with are gone for most of the summer and the girls will be left on their own.  Shortly after, while talking to her father on the phone, Kim watches Amanda being abducted and sees the men coming for her.  It turns out the man at the airport was the frontman for a group of individuals who make a fortune from kidnapping young foreign women, addicting them to drugs, and then selling them as sex slaves.  Bryan tells Kim what to do and she obeys his every command right up until the point she is taken herself.  Knowing that he has right around 48 hours to find his daughter before she is lost from him forever, Bryan begins calling in some favors and takes a personal jet of his wife's husband to Paris and begins looking for his daughter and hunting down the criminals who have taken her.TAKEN is an action-packed movie that doesn't really stop once it starts.  The first 15 minutes or so of the film are expositional in nature to introduce the audience to the characters, but from the moment that the kidnappers break into the Paris home until almost the very end of the picture, the movie is non-stop action.  Liam Neeson is a wonderful actor and I have yet to see him give a bad performance.Besides just being a good action movie, TAKEN also examines some subject matter that most Americans are unaware but should become more familiar.  There are some coincidences in the movie used for dramatic purposes, but the portrayal of how the women in the movie are abused and victimized isn't just startling, but is also quite accurate.  The kidnapping and selling of women as sex slaves is something that does happen and in some parts of the world has almost become common.Overall, I found TAKEN to be a very good movie. There are certain parts of the plot that are predictable, but the movie is action packed and makes for an afternoon or evening of enjoyable viewing.  It's also a movie that any parent with a daughter should watch.The two-disc version of the movie includes both cuts of the movie (PG-13 & Unrated versisons), two commentary tracks, a making of featurette ""Le Making Of"", a video of the movie's premier entitled ""Avant Premiere"", a featurette that illustrates how some of the action scenes were made, and some trailers.",4,Like a Real-Life Bond or Bourne,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,4256,"['One', 'most', 'exciting', 'interesting', 'movies', 'be', 'released', 'first-half', '2009', 'TAKEN', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'one', 'father', 'journey', 'rescue', 'daughter', 'Eastern', 'European', 'kidnappers', 'who', 'intend', 'sell', 'sex', 'slave', 'highest', 'bidder', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'retired', 'CIA', 'special', 'ops', 'man', 'who', 'recently', 'moved', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'closer', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'who', 'living', 'ex-wife', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'wealthy', 'stepfather', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'Bryan', 'daughter', 'deeply', 'feels', 'disconnected', 'posh', 'lifestyle', 'currently', 'living', 'concerned', 'might', 'be', 'loosing', 'way', 'When', 'Kim', 'presented', 'opportunity', 'travel', 'friend', 'Paris', 'summer', 'Bryan', 'idea', 'work', 'CIA', 'have', 'taught', 'how', 'dangerous', 'young', 'women', 'be', 'traveling', 'alone', 'Europe', 'Kim', 'underage', 'protective', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'have', 'been', 'overprotective', 'sheltered', 'knowledge', 'real', 'dangers', 'world', 'However', 'being', 'reassured', 'Kim', 'traveling', 'companion', 'Amanda', 'Katie', 'Cassidy', 'supervision', 'family', 'Paris', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'globe-trotting', 'alone', 'Kim', 'promise', 'would', 'call', 'father', 'day', 'let', 'go', 'only', 'later', 'girls', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'sort', 'educational', 'reason', 'be', 'band', 'groupie', 'following', 'particular', 'group', 'European', 'tour', 'Bryan', 'furious', 'still', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'better', 'judgment', 'go.Upon', 'arriving', 'Paris', 'Amanda', 'Kim', 'are', 'met', 'handsome', 'young', 'Frenchmen', 'who', 'party', 'later', 'night', 'rides', 'place', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'staying', 'Kim', 'bit', 'unsettled', 'many', 'Amanda', 'smitten', 'lust', 'arriving', 'residence', 'Kim', 'shocked', 'discover', 'Amanda', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'completely', 'honest', 'either', 'family', 'are', 'stay', 'are', 'gone', 'most', 'summer', 'girls', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'own', 'Shortly', 'talking', 'father', 'phone', 'Kim', 'Amanda', 'being', 'abducted', 'men', 'coming', 'out', 'man', 'airport', 'was', 'frontman', 'group', 'individuals', 'who', 'make', 'fortune', 'kidnapping', 'young', 'foreign', 'women', 'addicting', 'drugs', 'then', 'selling', 'sex', 'slaves', 'Bryan', 'Kim', 'what', 'do', 'obeys', 'command', 'right', 'up', 'point', 'taken', 'Knowing', 'right', '48', 'hours', 'find', 'daughter', 'lost', 'forever', 'Bryan', 'calling', 'favors', 'personal', 'jet', 'wife', 'husband', 'Paris', 'looking', 'daughter', 'hunting', 'down', 'criminals', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'her.TAKEN', 'action-packed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'stop', 'once', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'are', 'expositional', 'nature', 'introduce', 'audience', 'characters', 'moment', 'kidnappers', 'break', 'Paris', 'home', 'almost', 'very', 'end', 'picture', 'movie', 'non-stop', 'action', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'give', 'bad', 'performance.Besides', 'just', 'being', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'TAKEN', 'also', 'subject', 'matter', 'most', 'Americans', 'are', 'unaware', 'should', 'become', 'more', 'familiar', 'are', 'coincidences', 'movie', 'used', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'portrayal', 'how', 'women', 'movie', 'are', 'abused', 'victimized', ""n't"", 'just', 'startling', 'also', 'quite', 'accurate', 'kidnapping', 'selling', 'women', 'sex', 'slaves', 'something', 'happen', 'parts', 'world', 'almost', 'become', 'common.Overall', 'found', 'TAKEN', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'certain', 'parts', 'plot', 'are', 'predictable', 'movie', 'action', 'packed', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'also', 'movie', 'parent', 'daughter', 'should', 'watch.The', 'two-disc', 'version', 'movie', 'cuts', 'movie', 'PG-13', 'Unrated', 'versisons', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'making', 'featurette', 'Le', 'Making', 'video', 'movie', 'premier', 'entitled', 'Avant', 'Premiere', 'featurette', 'how', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'made', 'trailers']",Taken

Much to his dismay, Mills learns that daughter, Kim, played by Maggie Grace of ""Lost"" fame, will be traveling to Paris to follow U2's Euopean concert tour.  Although he is unhappy about it, there is little he can do, as ex-wife, Lenore, encourages the trip.  While there, Kim is kidnapped by a group of Albanese and forced into slave trafficking.  Mills, using all of his tricks of the trade and connections only has 96 hours to find his daughter before she is gone forever.  Mills travels to Paris to rescue her and he will let nothing stand in his way.  This film had me literally sitting on the edge of my seat threw out many of the action scenes.  Neeson, an ex-boxer, is perfectly cast as the steamrolling Mills, allowing no one to stop him.  I was pleasantly surprised at how believable Neeson is in it.

The pace picks up once they do, and you get something like your money's worth as Neesom jets off to Paris and sets about gunning down a small army of oily Albanian white slavers.

It's just a grind until eighty minutes later (Spolier Alert!) Neesom gets his daughter back.No vigilante movie worth its salt should let you get away without feeling morally compromised.

In fact, it's the best I've seen in a long time.THE PLOT: Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA agent whose 17-year-old daughter is abducted by Albanian sex-slavers while vacationing in Paris. Neeson immediately flies to Paris and utilizes all his skills to find his daughter and mercilessly punish anyone involved in the sex-trade who gets in his way.""Taken"" plays out like a James Bond flick but without the goofiness and boring parts. Once Neeson gets on the trail of the sex-slavers it's non-stop suspense and action until the end.What makes the film work so well is that, like Neeson's character in the story, the viewer is left totally outraged by the sex-slaver's abduction of his daughter; hence, you're passionately rooting for him throughout the rest of the flick.It's true that Neeson is a veritable one-man-army in the film but it's presented in such a way that the viewer is able to suspend disbelief. In other words, it SEEMS believable. More than that, you WANT it to be believable because you want him to get his daughter back and annihilate the scumbags. Besides, Neeson is realistically portrayed as a father ruthlessly driven and pulling no punches. He has the emotional edge and determination that the slavers lack. He's an unstoppable force pure and simple.The film addresses a scary subject -- the sex-slave trade. This really happens. I know of two beautiful young girls locally who have disappeared while vacationing abroad; one was in Cancun and the other in Africa. The parents and siblings are left devastated and scarred for life. What happened to the girls? No one knows, but the sex-slave trade is a very real possibility. Not to mention the Natalee Holloway case; Urine Van der Sloot confessed in an interview that he sold Natalee for $10,000 and a boat came and picked her up. This would explain why no remains have been found. Although he later retracked the statements the strong possibility remains that Natalee may have been sold into the sex-slave trade.The moral of ""Taken"" is simple: Anyone involved in the sex-slave trade deserves nothing but instant and merciless obliteration from this plane of existence.Incidentally, I read Roger Ebert's review before seeing the film and he gave it a mediocre 2.5/4 Star rating. Nothing could be further from the truth. ""Taken"" pulls you in and and takes you on an enthralling thrill ride throughout its runtime. Not to mention it's well made on every level. But let's remember that Ebert gave the overrated and pretentious ""No Country for Old Men"" a perfect 4/4 rating.

1194826,A14QS0VEMJTCI3,B001GCUNYO,W. Wood,"[655, 676]","When I was a soldier stationed in Germany in the 1970s there was a raid on a Turkish-owned bar on the outskirts of Frankfurt A/M. German Polizei and US CID (US Army Criminal Investigation Division) broke up a white slavery ring that had been operating out of the bar for some time. The bar was a way-point in the transportation route of young European girls (preferably blonde) who had been kidnapped throughout Europe and were being smuggled to be sold in the harems and brothels of the Middle and Far East. The police found some twenty girls in the basement of the bar, some from as far away as Denmark and the Netherlands, waiting to be shipped further down the pipeline.The German police and Interpol had been watching the bar for some time and were hoping to trace the route farther down the track to take down the ringleaders. The white slavers made the mistake of kidnapping the daughter of a US Army colonel whom they thought was a German national. The Colonel learned about the investigation and refused to allow his daughter to be held by the white slavers and victimized so the police could gather intelligence. As it turned out, I learned later, the raid eventually did lead to the disruption of this particular ring because the guys busted talked.So, when I learned what this film was about I went in with a certain amount of understanding of the subject matter. Let me say here that this film hits the nail on the head in presenting its subject matter and the way young women are victimized by ruthless animals only out to make a buck. (SPOILER) The scenes where they show the young women being made into drug addicts to control them are particularly disturbing to me as I've seen the impact drugs had on young girls working as unlicensed street walkers in Germany (a nation that legalized prostitution to make it ""safe"").  As disturbing as the film was I am glad I watched it and if I had a daughter (I had all sons) I would make her watch this film when she reached an appropriate age in hopes it would make her more careful in how she behaved when I wasn't around to protect her. This is a film every parent should watch - it is a film every teenaged girl and boy should watch. It's sad, but things like what happens to the girls in this movie go on every day.Having said that, the next question is, is the movie good?Well, I've never seen Liam Neeson deliver a bad performance. Even if I didn't like the movie (and he's done a couple turkeys) he has always been superb. No exception here. Sadly, most of the negative comments about this film seem to be from people who don't like action movies. But Neeson elevates this even above the typical action movie. This is a story of family. When I watched Neeson's reaction to what happens to his daughter and his response I imagine it is what Natalie Holloway's daddy wishes he could have done, what every father of a child who has been abducted and brutalized wish they could do.As a professional soldier and former martial arts instructor I find Neeson's action scenes are superbly executed and realistic. Don't look for a superhero leaping tall buildings with a single bound, but watch an expert, who may not be as young as he once was, doing what he knows best for a good cause. The fights are brutal, ruthless, and efficient, pros doing what they do. Even the violence is understated, brutal, but avoids the spectacular many audience have come to expect. What Neeson does is violent but considering the circumstances and motivation, necessary to save his girl. Great stuff.The alleged coincidences do not strain or insult the intelligence overmuch, this is an action movie for folks who think.  Of course, if you thought ""The English Patient"" deserved the Best Picture Oscar you'll probably hate this film. Otherwise, it is a don't miss. Neeson brings to the revenge flick empathy and gravitas lacking in other such films.As I watched the film I thought of that Army colonel fighting Interpol and the German police to save his daughter.

1194829,A29CNRYJKTNZQK,B001GCUNYO,yenrab,"[149, 155]","This is a review for the 2 disc version:Taken blew me away. It's a tight, well written action flick. Luc Besson wrote and produced this and the character building of Bryan (Neeson) reminds me a lot of ""The Cleaner"" in Leon: The Professional, which was an earlier work of Besson's. The action reminds me of the Bourne series but more satisfying in a way than Bourne. The first 30 minutes is awkward. But a lot of what Besson writes is awkward, but charmingly awkward. The extended cut is the European cut. They decided the American audience couldn't handle some of the scenes. There is NO nudity in this film at all and none in the extended cut.But what you get on the 2-disc version and not on the 1-disc is the following:""The Making of 'Taken'"" (18:22) - a featurette of the making of.""Avant Premiere"" (4:37) - video of the premier night in Paris""Inside Action: Side by Side Comparisons"" (11:05) - what it saysPlus, two tracks of commentary.The second disc is nothing but the digital copy which is extremely annoying.Is the 2-disc worth it? If you are a hardcore fan of Taken, then yes. If not, then buy the 1-disc cause that also has the extended cut. Buying the 2-disc is worth it for the commentary and 18 minute featurette.Cons:For me, the let down was the acting by Maggie Grace, but I'm not sure it's her fault. She is in real life a 25 year old woman and here she is unconvincingly playing a 17 year old teenager. I'm not saying she's a bad actor...she just doesn't pull off the age thing right. Her portrayal doesn't kill the film, and at times she nails it but at others it's just weird. They should have gotten an actress closer to 17 in real life. Even the ending was not realistic but I'm not sure it was Grace's fault. But at the same time she only endured the ordeal for less than 96 hours so I guess she might not be as traumatized as one would think she should be.Taken is a solid popcorn flick.

1194830,AP3B615GM191G,B001GCUNYO,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","While watching ""Taken"", the first thing that crossed my mind was: ""Wow, this could be the story of fictional TV character Jack Bauer's retirement years!"". Considering the success of 24, suffice it to say that I mean that as a compliment and thoroughly enjoyed this film.Basically, the plot of this film centers on Liam Neeson's character, who is estranged from his daughter (played by Maggie Grace) and really has no way back into her life anymore. Though tenuous about her decision to travel to Europe for a summer with a friend, he knows that not signing the consent form will only further drive a wedge between them, so he allows it. Of course, her and the friend are immediately targeted by European slave traders and kidnapped right out of their apartment, sending Neeson into action to try and get them back. The kicker, though, is that ""Neeson"", now retired, was once a government agent who worked for an agency not unlike that of ""CTU"" of ""24"" fame (at least that is how it is described). As a result, Neeson actually has a fair shot at tracking down his daughter's abductors for the remainder of the movie.What really separates this movie from other action fare, though, is the character development at the very beginning. Where other pure action films (Eagle Eye comes to mind) spend just a few precious minutes to develop the characters, the entire first 30 minutes (out of only 90 total) of ""Taken"" really fleshes out the father-daughter relationship. This makes you the viewer root even harder for Neeson cause when his daughter is taken.The acting is also very solid, albeit in a subdued fashion (at least from Neeson). Whereas Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer emotes wildly and often, Neeson's take on ""government agent"" is much more simmeringly intense. We understand how badly he wants his daughter back, but he doesn't have to pitch a fit to convince us. Also, Grace (""Shannon"" of LOST fame) transitions from well from small to big screen, as her innocent portrayal of a young girl also helps the audience become emotionally involved with the film.Thus, while this film is not epic in any sense of the word (hence the four-star rating), it is still very entertaining in a straight-forward sort of way by doing all the things that a good film should: developing characters, creating emotional attachments, and having enough of a plot to keep the action moving forward. If you are a fan of the ""thriller"" genre, please check this movie out...it may not shoot straight to the top of your ""favorite movies"" list, but you will also likely not be disappointed, either.",4,Jack Bauer: The Retirement Years,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,2578,"['watching', 'Taken', 'first', 'thing', 'crossed', 'mind', 'was', 'Wow', 'could', 'be', 'story', 'fictional', 'TV', 'character', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'retirement', 'years', 'Considering', 'success', '24', 'suffice', 'say', 'mean', 'compliment', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film.Basically', 'plot', 'film', 'centers', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'character', 'who', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'really', 'way', 'back', 'life', 'anymore', 'tenuous', 'decision', 'travel', 'Europe', 'summer', 'friend', 'not', 'signing', 'consent', 'form', 'will', 'only', 'further', 'drive', 'wedge', 'so', 'course', 'friend', 'are', 'immediately', 'targeted', 'European', 'slave', 'traders', 'kidnapped', 'right', 'apartment', 'sending', 'Neeson', 'action', 'try', 'get', 'back', 'kicker', 'Neeson', 'now', 'retired', 'was', 'once', 'government', 'agent', 'who', 'worked', 'agency', 'not', 'CTU', '24', 'fame', 'least', 'how', 'described', 'result', 'Neeson', 'actually', 'fair', 'shot', 'tracking', 'down', 'daughter', 'abductors', 'remainder', 'really', 'movie', 'other', 'action', 'fare', 'character', 'development', 'very', 'beginning', 'Where', 'other', 'pure', 'action', 'films', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'mind', 'spend', 'just', 'few', 'precious', 'minutes', 'develop', 'characters', 'entire', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'only', '90', 'total', 'Taken', 'really', 'out', 'father-daughter', 'relationship', 'viewer', 'root', 'even', 'harder', 'Neeson', 'cause', 'when', 'daughter', 'taken.The', 'acting', 'also', 'very', 'solid', 'albeit', 'subdued', 'fashion', 'least', 'Neeson', 'Whereas', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'wildly', 'often', 'Neeson', 'take', 'government', 'agent', 'much', 'more', 'simmeringly', 'intense', 'understand', 'how', 'badly', 'daughter', 'back', ""n't"", 'have', 'pitch', 'fit', 'convince', 'Also', 'Grace', 'Shannon', 'LOST', 'fame', 'transitions', 'well', 'small', 'big', 'screen', 'innocent', 'portrayal', 'young', 'girl', 'also', 'audience', 'become', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'film.Thus', 'film', 'not', 'epic', 'sense', 'word', 'hence', 'four-star', 'rating', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'straight-forward', 'sort', 'way', 'doing', 'things', 'good', 'film', 'should', 'developing', 'characters', 'creating', 'emotional', 'attachments', 'having', 'enough', 'plot', 'keep', 'action', 'moving', 'forward', 'are', 'fan', 'thriller', 'genre', 'please', 'check', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'shoot', 'straight', 'top', 'favorite', 'movies', 'list', 'will', 'also', 'likely', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Taken
