1061056,A20HNT8HYIYY0X,B000NVT0S4,"Adrian Stranik ""Ade""","[1, 1]","Embroiled, as we are, in the era of reality T.V, new bio-pic Factory Girl is a timely release charting, possibly, the genesis of our fascination with meaningless activities and the meaningless people who do them. Factory Girl is the truncated story of `Warhol Superstar' Edie Sedgwick, whose fleeting moment in the reflected glare of Andy Warhol's media glory became the prototype of today's production line celebrity machine; where nobodies are marketed as stars then immediately consigned to the out-tray as soon as the new batch arrives.Warhol, a prime exponent of the American angle on 60's Pop Art, created screen-prints that looked like strips of film and made films that looked like paintings; 8 hour epics of junkies sleeping off amphetamine comedowns or overnight zero-mentaries of the Empire State Building. But Warhol is, perhaps, best known for his Campbell's Soup tins and his apocalyptic prediction that ""in the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes."" Casting his frosty lens on the lunatics and hangers-on who adorned his upper East-Side studio known as The Factory, Warhol set about creating the world's first stable of manufactured stars. It was from this parade of crashed fabulousness that socialite and would be actress Edie Sedgwick's legend emerged.The clich&eacute;s of Edie's poor little rich girl background is almost textbook. The Sedgwick's were an American institution from `old money' with all the sociopathic pyrotechnics which that implies. Her father was a manic depressive psychotic who abused her and her siblings to the point of insanity, and in one case suicide. Edie high tailed it to New York with a siege on the Manhattan art scene where she was introduced to Warhol, quickly and spectacularly becoming his first superstar. For a year she was the `face of her generation' and the world revolved around her until her `walk on the wild side' took its inevitable route into a cul-de-sac of rehab, relapse and death at 28.Filmed in a freewheeling collision of primary-coloured flash and hi-contrast monochrome, Factory Girl sets a tone reminiscent of the recent Brian Jones Bio-pic Stoned; creating an authentic evocation of N.Y '65. Sienna Miller finally emerges from her own Edie-esque tabloidia and give us a performance worthy of the `near genius' turns of Naomi Watts, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman at their best. Only time will tell if she shares their versatility.On less steady footing however is Edie's love affair with the Dylan-esque figure of Billy Quinn, played by post-Vader boy Hayden Christensen, who, as the film has it, precipitated her demise having rejected her to marry a bunny girl. This is based on an unsubstantiated relationship which may or may not have resulted in any number of rock classics, such as `Just Like a Woman', `Leopard-skin Pill Box hat' and the ground breaking `Like a Rolling Stone' inadvertently establishing Edie's place in the pantheon of pop mythology. But the primary element of any myth or legend is the circumstances of their death. Factory Girl's fast forwarding with a title card announcing her exit via overdose in 1971 renders the rest of the film a waste of time. Why not have a title card right at the beginning telling you everything that happens thus saving two hours which could be spent watching something else? Hell, why make films at all? - Just put up title cards describing them.It's somewhat telling that there has never been a film about Warhol directly despite having been portrayed time and time again as a secondary character in anything from Bowie's turn in `Basquiat', Jared Leto in `I Shot Andy Warhol' and Crispin Glover's cartoon-a-like in `The Doors' and here we have Guy Pierce playing the role as a detached phone-a-holic; his `Loner at the Ball' persona perfectly at home as a wan shadow haunting brighter stars. I think Warhol would have relished the concept of being a cameo in his own life story.",3,Beyond God and Edie,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,3927,"['Embroiled', 'are', 'era', 'reality', 'T.V', 'new', 'bio-pic', 'Factory', 'Girl', 'timely', 'release', 'charting', 'possibly', 'genesis', 'fascination', 'meaningless', 'activities', 'meaningless', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'Factory', 'Girl', 'truncated', 'story', 'Warhol', 'Superstar', 'Edie', 'Sedgwick', 'fleeting', 'moment', 'reflected', 'glare', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'media', 'glory', 'became', 'prototype', 'today', 'production', 'line', 'celebrity', 'machine', 'where', 'nobodies', 'are', 'marketed', 'stars', 'then', 'immediately', 'consigned', 'out-tray', 'as', 'soon', 'new', 'batch', 'arrives.Warhol', 'prime', 'exponent', 'American', 'angle', '60', 'Pop', 'Art', 'created', 'screen-prints', 'looked', 'strips', 'film', 'made', 'films', 'looked', 'paintings', '8', 'hour', 'epics', 'junkies', 'sleeping', 'off', 'amphetamine', 'comedowns', 'overnight', 'zero-mentaries', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'Warhol', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'Campbell', 'Soup', 'tins', 'apocalyptic', 'prediction', 'future', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'famous', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Casting', 'frosty', 'lunatics', 'hangers-on', 'who', 'adorned', 'upper', 'East-Side', 'studio', 'known', 'Factory', 'Warhol', 'set', 'creating', 'world', 'first', 'stable', 'manufactured', 'stars', 'was', 'parade', 'crashed', 'fabulousness', 'socialite', 'would', 'be', 'actress', 'Edie', 'Sedgwick', 'legend', 'emerged.The', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'Edie', 'poor', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'background', 'almost', 'textbook', 'Sedgwick', 'were', 'American', 'institution', 'old', 'money', 'sociopathic', 'pyrotechnics', 'father', 'was', 'manic', 'depressive', 'psychotic', 'who', 'abused', 'siblings', 'point', 'insanity', 'one', 'case', 'suicide', 'Edie', 'high', 'tailed', 'New', 'York', 'siege', 'Manhattan', 'art', 'scene', 'where', 'was', 'introduced', 'Warhol', 'quickly', 'spectacularly', 'becoming', 'first', 'superstar', 'year', 'was', 'face', 'generation', 'world', 'revolved', 'walk', 'wild', 'side', 'took', 'inevitable', 'route', 'cul-de-sac', 'rehab', 'relapse', 'death', '28.Filmed', 'freewheeling', 'collision', 'primary-coloured', 'flash', 'hi-contrast', 'monochrome', 'Factory', 'Girl', 'tone', 'reminiscent', 'recent', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'Bio-pic', 'Stoned', 'creating', 'authentic', 'evocation', 'N.Y', ""'65"", 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'finally', 'own', 'Edie-esque', 'tabloidia', 'give', 'performance', 'worthy', 'near', 'genius', 'turns', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'best', 'Only', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'shares', 'versatility.On', 'steady', 'footing', 'however', 'Edie', 'love', 'affair', 'Dylan-esque', 'figure', 'Billy', 'Quinn', 'played', 'post-Vader', 'boy', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'who', 'film', 'precipitated', 'demise', 'having', 'rejected', 'marry', 'bunny', 'girl', 'based', 'unsubstantiated', 'relationship', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'resulted', 'number', 'rock', 'classics', 'such', 'Just', 'Woman', 'Leopard-skin', 'Pill', 'Box', 'hat', 'ground', 'breaking', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'inadvertently', 'establishing', 'Edie', 'place', 'pantheon', 'pop', 'mythology', 'primary', 'element', 'myth', 'legend', 'circumstances', 'death', 'Factory', 'Girl', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'title', 'card', 'announcing', 'exit', 'overdose', '1971', 'renders', 'rest', 'film', 'waste', 'time', 'Why', 'not', 'have', 'title', 'card', 'right', 'beginning', 'telling', 'everything', 'thus', 'saving', 'two', 'hours', 'could', 'be', 'spent', 'watching', 'something', 'else', 'Hell', 'why', 'make', 'films', 'Just', 'put', 'up', 'title', 'cards', 'describing', 'them.It', 'somewhat', 'telling', 'never', 'been', 'film', 'Warhol', 'directly', 'having', 'been', 'portrayed', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'secondary', 'character', 'anything', 'Bowie', 'turn', 'Basquiat', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Shot', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'cartoon-a-like', 'Doors', 'here', 'have', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'playing', 'role', 'detached', 'phone-a-holic', 'Loner', 'Ball', 'persona', 'perfectly', 'home', 'wan', 'shadow', 'haunting', 'brighter', 'stars', 'think', 'Warhol', 'would', 'have', 'relished', 'concept', 'being', 'cameo', 'own', 'life', 'story']",N/A

Factory Girl is what Andy Warhol used to call Edie when she was his ""muse"" and close friend.

I felt Warhol took advantage of Edie during her most vulnerable time in her life, I'm not saying Edie was a victim, but I do think Andy was aware of Edie's emotional problems and played on them.

While not the first fictional attempt to show the Factory days of Warhol (see such films as The Doors and Basquiat), it presents what will become a standard historical (hysterical?) take on what happened there.  Sienna Miller is okay as Edie, though where's the scar the real Edie had between her eyebrows?  It showed that she was physically as well as psychologically damaged.  I am also taken back by the way Dylan was treated, or should I say ""Musician""?  Edie's brother claims that Edie aborted Dylan's baby, but there's no evidence that's true.  Her affair was with Bob Neuwirth.  And when Edie did Ciao Manhattan, the rambling, horrifying audio tapes she made about her life mention no abortion.  She did have an abortion when she was 20, long before any of this.

Dravis ""BETTY DRAVIS, author/reviewer""","[2, 2]","I bought this film because I wanted to discover the truth behind what happened to the ill-fated, poor-little-rich-girl Edie Sedgwick, to learn more about artist Andy Warhol and their relationship. I should have read books about their lives instead. I am that disappointed in this movie...Factory Girl (Unrated)is the true story about an art student, Edie Sedgwick, who captures the interest of famous artist Andy Warhol when he's first ""stocking"" his infamous Studio--known as ""The Factory""--with a wild, self-indulgent entourage of ""hangers-on"" who dote on the man and the New York art scene. Although Edie is a blue-blood from an important family, there are dark family secrets from which she's trying to escape. With her beauty, charm and independent spirit, Andy sees in her something he can exploit and stars her in some underground movies. The two are a hit, they become best friends and Edie's suddenly a New York City favorite. Pretty heady stuff for a girl like Edie; exposure to the wild crowd at the ""Factory"" soon leads to her use of drugs.Already on a path to destruction, Edie's real downfall is when she has an affair with ""The Musician"" and Andy becomes jealous and starts to shun her. She's devastated by the loss of her ""best friend,"" so she gives up her new friend, but by then it's too late: Andy has already written her off. Estranged from her family and without Andy to bolster her, she delves deeper into drugs and soon goes through her trust fund. She has nowhere to go but down...This is a sad story about a sad woman that Warhol tries to help--but does he try hard enough? Anyway, he's into self-survival and is smart enough to realize he can't give money to a drug addict. So he, like everyone else, ultimately lets Edie down.Factory Girl (Unrated)is a well-done film, but a bit too fast-paced to allow for deep character development. Sienna Miller is good in the role of Edie because she's talented and bears a striking resemblance to the tragic woman, but she never lets us see the ""real"" Edie. Hayden Christensen put in a good performance as Billy Quinn, but Guy Pearce steals the show! His clever characterization of Andy Warhol is fascinating; he skillfully hides his neuroses beneath a seemingly bland facade of indifference.The movie's strong points are:1. Pearce's portrayal of Andy Warhol.2. Miller's stunning good looks.3. Accurate depiction of the Sixties era.4. Good photography.The weak points are:1. It seems to attempt to paint Warhol as the cause of Sedgwick's downfall, but fails in that regard.2. It veers from the truth.

She got her mannerism and part of her looks down but she could not convey Edie's vunerability and her angelic-face-apple-cheeked innocence.  Edie's face shows 60's perfectly; a 50's debutante girl made up with 60's psychedelic colors and mod fashion.  Miss Miller seemed too self-possessed to be Edie.

While Edie Sedgwick without a doubt had deep emotional problems, she was also incredibly intelligent, well-educated and articulate.  To portray her as a naive dip who does nothing but search for love is over-simplication at it's worst.  The real Edie was much more complex than that.  The film is highly-fictionalized as well, which only adds to it's annoyance factor.  Reveiwers who praise the film and/or Miller's performance have no concept of Sedgwick, Warhol or The Factory.

Not to be condescending to the individuals who influence the films based on their life but half the time it seems as if the film carries an aura of self-importance like it wants to be seen as socially important and show a director can do a piece of gravitas and pathos. On that note, watching a film like Factory Girl, you at least applaud the idea behind the making of the film but everything just falls apart around it.Edie Sedgwick was a real-life rich girl who was rather psychologically damaged thanks to an incredibly dysfunctional home. But with stars in her eyes, she sets out to be famous and in the process is introduced to 60's art icon Andy Warhol. She gets accepted within his group, ""the Factory"" which make small films and do drugs. But Sedgwick starts to become a worse drug addict and despite her blossoming relationship with a young musician, she still seems like someone who should be more than what she'll end up becoming.Sometimes watching a bad movie can be forgiven if the acting is up to snuff and thankfully we have Sienna Miller. Let's face it: Miller's been getting more attention for her relationship with Jude Law than anything despite some great performances in the past. Here she's all over the place in a good way, from hopeful to depressed to manic without that sort of ""jump"" quality where actors go through different moods without no overall progression. Then we have Guy Pierce, probably best known as Lenny from ""Memento"", plays the flamboyant Warhol and it's a great performance since there are times where he does get reflective but then becomes a complete jerk right after. As far as Hayden Christensen is concerned who's playing the obvious Bob Dylan-esque character, he's likable since he seems to be the only sane one in the bunch.One might wonder why a film based on Edie Sedgwick was made since most probably never even heard of her. Is it that her contributions to art and fashion are important, even if we're not aware of it? Or a lesson in girls with big dreams who end up losing it all at a young age(Sedgwick died of an overdose at 28)? Who knows but the film wants you to say yes to everything and there's a feeling this film wants to be this huge historical look into an icon and is damn proud of it. And that's distracting but I've noticed a lot of films have been taking that tone lately.Factory Girl is a great example of a film where the acting is probably its saving grace. Ever see the Oscar nominee list and see actors/actresses nominated and you've never even heard of the movie? Same idea here. Miller and Pearce's performances at least deserve a nod; it's just to bad the rest of the film can't, and really shouldn't either.",3,Appreciate the intent than the movie,1186185600,"08 4, 2007",2007,2744,"['always', 'saw', 'biopics', 'so-called', 'Oscar', 'bait', 'genre', 'Not', 'be', 'condescending', 'individuals', 'who', 'influence', 'films', 'based', 'life', 'time', 'film', 'aura', 'self-importance', 'be', 'seen', 'socially', 'important', 'show', 'director', 'can', 'do', 'piece', 'gravitas', 'pathos', 'note', 'watching', 'film', 'Factory', 'Girl', 'least', 'applaud', 'idea', 'making', 'film', 'everything', 'just', 'apart', 'it.Edie', 'Sedgwick', 'was', 'real-life', 'rich', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'rather', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'thanks', 'incredibly', 'dysfunctional', 'home', 'stars', 'eyes', 'out', 'be', 'famous', 'process', 'introduced', '60', 'art', 'icon', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'accepted', 'group', 'Factory', 'make', 'small', 'films', 'do', 'drugs', 'Sedgwick', 'become', 'worse', 'drug', 'addict', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'young', 'musician', 'still', 'someone', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'what', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'becoming.Sometimes', 'watching', 'bad', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'acting', 'up', 'snuff', 'thankfully', 'have', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'Let', 'face', 'Miller', 'been', 'getting', 'more', 'attention', 'relationship', 'Jude', 'Law', 'anything', 'great', 'performances', 'past', 'Here', 'place', 'good', 'way', 'hopeful', 'depressed', 'manic', 'sort', 'jump', 'quality', 'where', 'actors', 'go', 'different', 'moods', 'overall', 'progression', 'Then', 'have', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'Lenny', 'Memento', 'flamboyant', 'Warhol', 'great', 'performance', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'get', 'reflective', 'then', 'complete', 'jerk', 'right', 'As', 'far', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'concerned', 'who', 'playing', 'obvious', 'Bob', 'Dylan-esque', 'character', 'likable', 'be', 'only', 'sane', 'one', 'bunch.One', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'film', 'based', 'Edie', 'Sedgwick', 'was', 'made', 'most', 'probably', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'contributions', 'art', 'fashion', 'are', 'important', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'aware', 'lesson', 'girls', 'big', 'dreams', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'losing', 'young', 'age', 'Sedgwick', 'died', 'overdose', '28', 'Who', 'film', 'say', 'yes', 'everything', 'feeling', 'film', 'be', 'huge', 'historical', 'look', 'icon', 'damn', 'proud', 'distracting', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'lot', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'taking', 'tone', 'lately.Factory', 'Girl', 'great', 'example', 'film', 'where', 'acting', 'probably', 'saving', 'grace', 'Ever', 'see', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'list', 'see', 'actors/actresses', 'nominated', ""'ve"", 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'movie', 'Same', 'idea', 'here', 'Miller', 'Pearce', 'performances', 'least', 'deserve', 'nod', 'just', 'bad', 'rest', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'either']",N/A

The rest of the cast is a capable talent.  And frankly, Jimmy Fallen was just a little too convincing as the parasite of Edie and Warhol.Yes, the movie was fast paced, but it matched the subject.  And you do need knowledge of the time and this ""scene,"" but you can get along without it.  The plot was disjointed and seemed to transcend any real timeline, but maybe this was supposed to be a vapid, strikingly superficial look at this story, a mirror of the story itself.

If there wasn't some merit to his work we wouldn't still be talking about him or portraying him in films.  What I found interesting about ""Factory Girl"" is that they contrast Warhol's artistry with that of a Dylanesque character and the result isn't flattering.  One would almost think that the makers of ""Factory Girl"" are villifying Warhol and there may be an element of truth there.  Thrown into the mix is socialite Edie Sedgwick whose physical beauty masks a wounded psyche.  Sedgwick, along with Marilyn Monroe, served as a muse for Warhol until her chemical addiction made her dispensible.  This film could very easily have fallen into self-parody if it weren't for some terrific performances by the film's leads.  Guy Pearce is absolutely stupendous as Warhol capturing his weaknesses and contradictions for what amounts to an ultimately sensitive portrayal.  He's equalled by Sienna Miller as Edie who injects poignancy to her ultimately doomed character.  Hayden Christensen avoids cliche in his folksinger role which makes you wonder why Dylan wouldn't lend his name to the film even if his part in the proceedings is probably speculative.

1061076,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B000NVT0S4,D. Hartley,"[2, 5]","Edie Sedgwick was a Paris Hilton-type figure of the 1960s; a trust fund babe with an ability to attract the paparazzi by associating with just the right people in just the right places. She arrived in New York City in the mid 60s and was drawn to the downtown art scene, where she was spotted by Andy Warhol, who became platonically smitten with her wide-eyed, waif-like beauty and vowed to make her a ""superstar"". Warhol featured her in a number of his experimental films, and she became the iconic symbol of the ""Factory"", a warehouse space where Warhol worked on his multi-media projects and played host to a revolving door co-op of avant-garde artists, musicians, actors and hangers-on. Sedgwick fell from grace with Warhol and tragically died of a drug overdose at the age of 28.This is a pretty rich vein from which to mine a juicy biopic. The director is no stranger to this territory; his outstanding 2003 documentary about L.A. DJ/rock impresario Rodney Bingenheimer, ""The Mayor of the Sunset Strip"" basically deals with the same theme. So, is George Hickenlooper up to the task? Well,yes and no.Hickenlooper's affection for the subject at hand is evidenced in his canny visual replication of the 1960s underground art scene; he alternates grainy, b&w; film footage with highly saturated 16mm color stock and utilizes a lot of hand-held cinema verite style shots, cleverly aping the look of Warhol's own experimental films. The fashion, the music, and the overall vibe of the era is well-captured here.So the film has a great look, but what about the narrative? Aye,there's the rub. The director's pastiche approach plays like the Cliff's Notes version of Warhol and Sedgwick's partnership. A lot of things are left unexplained; peripheral characters come and go without much exposition (it wasn't until the credits rolled that I learned tidbits like ""Oh. THAT character was supposed to be Moe Tucker from the Velvet Underground. Coulda fooled me...""). Ironically, the 30 minute extra on the DVD,featuring recollections from friends and family. serves up much more insight into what made Sedgwick tick than the full length feature does.One cannot fault the actors. Sienna Miller does an admirable job portraying the arc of Edie's transition from innocent pixie to haggard junkie. Guy Pearce completely disappears into a spooky evocation of Warhol. It's not as easy as one might think to inhabit Warhol's deadpan persona; several actors have tried(David Bowie, Jared Harris and Crispin Glover) but generally end up doing little more than donning a white wig, affecting a blank stare and tossing out the rote catch phrases (""Umm, yeah. That's great."" ""Yeah, hi.""). Even the usually wooden Hayden Christensen registers a pulse and gets with the program, doing a passable impression of Bob Dylan. Oh, I'm sorry-did I say `Bob Dylan'? I meant to say, `Billy Quinn' (as in ""The Mighty Quinn""-get it?), referred to in the film only as a ""folk singer""""Factory Girl"" is perhaps not quite as dismal as many have led you to believe, but it is still not as good as one might have hoped (I guess we can call this a `mixed review', no?)

I think that her story was long overdue, but because people still see her as a beloved person that knew her, Dylan and Reed were really upset with the film.Before seeing ""Factory Girl"", watch or revisit ""I Shot Andy Warhol"", which is another point of view on Warhol (this one has Lily Taylor, Stephen Dorff in drag and Michael Imperioli), and you can see a not so flattering side of Warhol using and manipulating.The film itself is better than expected, but to hide Dylan (or make a composite Dylan out of 2 people) and to use everyone else's real name says a lot. I don't think he did Dylan as good as Cate Blanchett did though, but you get the point.Guy Pearce got Warhol down, Sienna Miller did a fine job as Edie, but it kind of reminded me of the same flaws I found with ""Sid and Nancy's"" where they both played iconic figures but were in movies that weren't.You can't say anything bad about the actors. The interest of doing a movie about her is reason enough, but people either love or hate it... esp.Jimmy Fallon actually impressed me, I think he's better suited for supporting roles.Supposedly one of the Olsen twins was in the movie... not sure where though.After watching ""Factory Girl"", check out ""Ciao Manhattan"" and see the real Edie.Truth is stranger than fiction regarding Warhol himself. - the PBS Doc,""The Complete Picture"", the Warhol Diaries, Popism,his movies (which are either bootlegged or via import, but that's where you'll find Edie in the Warhol movies) or screened at the Warhol museum in Pittsburgh), ""Superstar"", ""Nico Icon"".

1061079,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B000NVT0S4,Doug Anderson,"[5, 7]","Why Biopics are So Bad:Problem One: Biopics are notoriously reductive. Real people are complex but biopics are always trying to turn real people's real lives into storylines with plots, or worse: morality plays. Real life and real lives do not necessarily have plots from which we can parse meanings; people do not live so that their lives can be transformed into movies. Warhol may have thought fame was the ultimate drug, but most of his hangers-on made fun of the debacle that was stardom. The Warhol crew debunked Hollywood myths and icons and they mocked the Hollywood myth and icon making machine. They didn't really admire the famous anymore than they admired America, they wanted to expose the famous and the seedy underside of fame and in doing so expose America. Warhol and his factory workers turned fame and America into high camp. This was brilliant and this is what Edie was attracted to (I'm guessing). This biopic, however, makes it look as though Edie just didn't get it, and that she thought Andy was being sincere when he labeled her a ""superstar."" Ok, I never knew Edie but I doubt the filmakers did either; nevertheless, they have decided to take a reverent stance toward Edie and an irreverent one toward Andy. And present Edie as a victim and Andy as a victimizer. Why? Because you need a good conflict to make cinema seems to be the answer on these unimaginative filmmakers minds. This seems highly problematic for several reasons, but the primary reason why this way of thinking always equals bad art is because this kind of thinking requires that the adherents reject the complications of real life in favor of familiar fictive formulas; formulas that require that there always be two sides to every equation: good and bad guys, victims and exploiters, innocents and experienced artists/actors/social players. These filmakers simply cast aside reality and invent an ""Edie"" that fits the former and an ""Andy"" that fits the latter side of these simplistic binaries. This is insanely reductive. It also happens to be classic feminism, but with one glaring problem: Andy hardly fits the part of the classic ""exploitive male"" and Edie the part of the classic ""exploited female."" Its also ironic: this film takes two people who were famous for mocking American artistic and social and symbolic structures/paradigms (including its gender paradigms which were reified over and over again in Hollywood films) and turns them into formulaic players in the kind of movie that they would have loved to hate.Problem Two: It is VERY difficult to make a film about a real person, and especially a real person that living people still remember. The reason people become famous and achieve the iconographic status that they do has to do with indeterminable and unnamable factors. But the actors that play these enormous icons do not themselves possess those indeterminable and unnamable factors that made the original so unique and so striking. Just looking like someone doesn't qualify you to play them: look-a-like celebrities (even if the look-a-like is a celebrity in their own right) are always weak. Looking at someone doing a bad impersonation of Jack Nicholson just makes you feel sad for the world. We should be originals not bad copies. Biopic acting is always bad acting. Movie versions of real lives are always bad.No one will ever be able to play John F.Kennedy, or Elvis, or Mick, or Brian Jones, or John Lennon, or Bob Dylan, or Kurt Cobain.No one will be ever able to play Freida Kahlo, or Marilyn Monroe, or Edie Sedgwick, or Patti Smith.Unique people are unique. Actors can't play them. And impersonations always look like impersonations. Purposely bad impersonations are the only really good ones.Problem Three: The makers of biopics are bad historians. In most cases, history, to the crafter of a biopic, is the same as ambiance and is no more or less important than any other design element. In the cases when time period does matter, and historical context is respected as a significant factor in peoples lives, history is presented in caricature.  With the sixties in particular filmmakers have been especially inaccurate. They invariably get it wrong; either they over-sentimentalize or over-idealize the decade, or they judge its excesses. Factory Girl does the latter. It does not make the sixties look in any way attractive, rather the sixties through the eyes of this filmmaker just look filthy (as in grimy) and seedy and mean.Problem Four: Films with an agenda are always bad. This is a film with a feminist agenda. Feminism is not necessarily bad, but feminist films are always bad. Even if we take the film on its own feminist terms and consider the possibility that feminine muses often end up being victimized by those male artists that they inspire (Rodin's model and muse and apprentice Camille Claudel is another historical example)we still end up in a hopelessly reductive virtual land that has little to do with the actual world. The film begs us to see Edie as a helpless victim of her father's and Andy's and other prowling male's vile desires. But are we to assume her own desires/ambitions/manipulations are holy just because they are feminine?A Note on Ciao Manhattan: Ciao Manhattan is a fascinating and wonderfully trashy early 70's burn-out film. In it Edie plays an ""Edie""-like ""star"" whose coming down from a decade-long high surrounded by a number of B-movie characters.  It's fascinating because we think we are watching someone play themselves. But whether this is Edie being Edie or Edie playing an old version of herself or someone elses idea of her is impossible to tell. Biopics are never really about real life. They are products. They are about preconceived & pre-packaged ways of thinking about life, and second-hand and second-rate ways of thinking about life at that. Because its actually Edie on screen viewers want to believe this film is different than most biopics. Edie herself, however, seems much less interested in her reality or her myth than everyone else around her seems to be. Maybe at the factory she liked to be looked at, but in this film it seems Edie no longer feels like anyone that matters is looking anymore. In Ciao Manhattan she is always dazed & confused, she never really wakes up, its as if there is no longer anyone there to wake up for. Maybe for her life was a performance and in the end there was just no one left to perform for.The film is both a deconstruction of a star and a last act. So, gaudy & tasteless as it is (to turn someones pain & suffering into spectacle), there is something there (Edie herself) that transcends the usual biopic paradigms. And even though we feel guilty for looking, we can't seem to take our eyes off of her. Its as if there is something there that we want, that we need to know but we can never quite put our finger on it. That is the nature of stardom.Recommended for further viewing: Nicolas Roeg's Performance",2,Why Biopics are So  Bad,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,6946,"['Why', 'Biopics', 'are', 'So', 'Bad',

As a dramatic film, I enjoyed it. I thought Sienna Miller's performance was excellent. In fact, ""Factory Girl"" and ""Interview"" have both, in my opinion, proved her to be a formidable screen presence. Miller creates a complex character who is both damaged and innocent, and whose natural charisma brings her plenty of attention but is unable to bring her the love and security she desperately needs.The film, which covers Edie's life from the time she left art school in London to her early death at 28, revolves almost entirely around her relationships with the men in her life. Starting with her horrific, abusive father, all of the men in her life, whether straight or gay, friend or lover, use her to advance their own agendas and then discard her when she's no longer useful. The centerpiece of the film is her relationship with Andy Warhol, which is complex and also seems to mirror her various other traumas ... Warhol represents a combination of the benevolent father figure Edie never had, the gay brother Edie lost to suicide, and her own creative and artistic ambitions.Edie seems to love Warhol like a puppy loves his owner. Warhol's feelings for Edie are much more complicated. Although he seems to have real affection towards her, he is clearly also drawn to her for completely superficial reasons: her wealth, her looks, and her willingness to let him use her however he wants in his creatives projects. The relationship sours when Edie falls in love with a famous musician who is disgusted by Warhol's world.

If you ask:  ""Was the cast good?""  The answer is yes.  However, it's simply not what I expected, and that's my fault.  I did not read the plot of the movie.  I read about how it was un-rated & heard that Sienna Miller did some nude scenes in it.  Both are true, but neither was able to overcome my lack of interest in the story.The movie is based on a true story of a woman named Edie Sedgwick.  She was part of Andy Warhol's entourage in the 1960s.  I'd always figured Warhol to be a quack.  If this film is remotely accurate, then Warhol was even more of a quack than I thought!Sienna Miller gives a terrific performance.  Guy Pearce is creepy and whacked-out enough to play Warhol.  The problem is, I just couldn't get into the story.  I've always had a big problem having sympathy for junkies, as it seems to me that they ""make their own beds"" insofar as their myriad problems are concerned.  The movie reminded me a lot of Angelina Jolie'sGia (Unrated Edition), which was about another troubled young woman / junkie from about a decade later.I will be, in the end, as fair as I can be here.  If you are a big fan of Andy Warhol and / or Edie Sedgwick, then this film certainly belongs on your shelf of DVDs.  If you are (like me) mainly drawn to this film due to the fact that it's Un-Rated, then I would recommend you find other, more saucy UR films.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[4, 7]","One of the most notorious self-destructs of the last century was Edie Sedgwick, a glamorous poor-little-rich-girl whose distant pixielike beauty made her Andy Warhol's muse.Too bad her biopic ""Factory Girl"" is basically a piece of drivelling trash, with all the depth and artistic intelligence of a ""Biography"" episode, based on the director's massive crush on his subject. And it doesn't help that the supremely untalented Sienna Miller gives Edie all the life of a block of wood.Edie Sedgwick (Sienna Miller) was an American blueblood, with vast quantities of money and a bright future. But she encountered Andy Warhol (Guy Pearse), the pop artist who turned the art/music world on its ear, and soon she was his ""muse,"" even starring in some of the brief films that Warhol directed. For a time, she was on top of the world.But soon Edie's inner torment began to surface, as two men began a tug-o-war with her affections -- Warhol, and the handsome young folkie Bob Dylan.... I mean, Quinn (Hayden Christensen). And Edie's lover can't stop her from descending into a personal hell, which ultimately destroyed her.They've been trying to drum up notice for this film by sprinkling the rumor that Christensen and Miller really had sex for the cameras. Well, the rumors are actually more interesting than the movie itself -- despite Sedgwick's life of sex, film, glamor and drugs, ""Factory Girl"" is dull as ditchwater.Basically, it's a love letter from director George Hickenlooper to Edie, and his unwillingness to grasp that the ruination of her life can't be blamed on anyone.Though Sedgwick was already on drugs and pain when she met Warhol, here she's a pitiful waif damsel who is being fought over by handsome Dylan and the evil queeny Warhol -- who, the movie not-so-subtlely suggests, ruined her life.The whole movie feels rushed. Hickenlooper tries to include every style and bit of trivia of the period, making it feel like a clumsy cram. And the messiness extends to the story -- a tangle of flashbacks, splicing, parties, trashy glitz, and characters that flit in and out without much consequence -- not to mention the ""interviews,"" which are apparently included because the plot is too incoherent. Oy.And the actors cannot bring their legendary characters to life. Miller is a screeching, histrionic creature without glamour, range or poignancy, and definitely without Edie's beauty.

1061083,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000NVT0S4,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 7]","For the concerted effort Sienna Miller puts into her searing portrayal of Warhol prot&eacute;g&eacute; and underground celebrity Edie Sedgwick, it would have been rewarding to experience a film that matches her unbridled dramatic impact. Unfortunately, director George Hickenlooper, primarily a documentary filmmaker, seems more focused on eye-catching cinematic techniques - a deliberately artsy mix of overtly dramatic images, grainy film stock and slow-motion photography - than honest character development in this highly fictionalized 2007 account of her brief life. The result feels energetic but ultimately rather cursory in the way he depicts the Manhattan party scene in the mid-1960's, in particular, the Factory, where Warhol let his coterie of drug-addicted fame-seekers gather to make virtually unwatchable films that reflect their constant state of ennui.With her big raccoon eyes, pre-punk hairdo and flashing smile, Miller bears such a striking resemblance to the real-life Sedgwick that she carries much of the film by the sheer will of her character's Holly Golightly-like sense of exalted self-worth. But like Holly, Sedgwick lacked talent to sustain a film career, and the script leaves Miller to her own devices in connecting us with her character's tormented psyche amid her escalating drug use. On the upside, Guy Pearce accurately captures the discomfiting public image of Warhol down to the familiar narcissistic indifference and manipulative shyness, but his character gradually recedes into the background. At first, Hayden Christensen comes across as amateurish and unintentionally amusing as a Bob Dylan doppelganger, especially since he makes a feeble attempt at capturing the singer's recognizable speech cadences. Just as he manages to transcend the awkwardness of the character's intrusion into the story, he also disappears making his impact in Sedgwick's life feel rather fleeting.Even though the cryptic screenplay by Captain Mauzner, Aaron Richard Golub and Simon Monjack conveniently paints Warhol and the faux-Dylan as polarizing figures pulling at Sedgwick's soul, the story really comes down to her own inner demons. The problem is that she remains oddly elliptical throughout, and Hickenlooper seems satisfied with leaving us with an impressionistic view of a person who barely warrants our attention forty years later. Among the supporting players, there are quite a familiar faces - Ileana Douglas as Vogue editor Diana Vreeland, Jimmy Fallon as Sedgwick's confidante Chuck Wein, Tara Summers as fellow Warhol prot&eacute;g&eacute; Brigid Berlin, Mena Suvari as Brigid's sister Richie, Edward Herrmann as the family attorney, Mary Kate Olsen as a partygoer. However, none of them are given any opportunity to shine.The 2007 DVD includes several extras of varying interest, the best being an insightful commentary track from Hickenlooper and a thirty-minute documentary on the life of the real Sedgwick that mimics the main film's stylistic touches. There is also a bland ten-minute making-of featurette, a scene that was understandably excised, audition footage of Miller, the original theatrical trailer, and a twenty-minute behind-the-scenes video diary coordinated by Pearce. Despite strong work from Miller and Pearce, the film is only marginally effective as a dramatic vehicle even as Hickenlooper viscerally evokes a fascinating period of history in the arts scene.",3,Evocative But Frustratingly Elliptical Look at Andy Warhol's Factory and the Sad Party Girl in the Middle,1188950400,"09 5, 2007",2007,3416,"['concerted', 'effort', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'searing', 'portrayal', 'Warhol', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'underground', 'celebrity', 'Edie', 'Sedgwick', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'film', 'unbridled', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'George', 'Hickenlooper', 'primarily', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'more', 'focused', 'eye-catching', 'cinematic', 'techniques', 'deliberately', 'artsy', 'mix', 'overtly', 'dramatic', 'images', 'grainy', 'film', 'stock', 'slow-motion', 'photography', 'honest', 'character', 'development', 'highly', 'fictionalized', '2007', 'account', 'brief', 'life', 'result', 'feels', 'energetic', 'ultimately', 'rather', 'cursory', 'way', 'Manhattan', 'party', 'scene', 'mid-1960', 'particular', 'Factory', 'where', 'Warhol', 'let', 'coterie', 'drug-addicted', 'fame-seekers', 'gather', 'make', 'virtually', 'unwatchable', 'films', 'reflect', 'constant', 'state', 'ennui.With', 'big', 'raccoon', 'eyes', 'pre-punk', 'hairdo', 'flashing', 'smile', 'Miller', 'such', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'real-life', 'Sedgwick', 'much', 'film', 'sheer', 'will', 'character', 'Holly', 'Golightly-like', 'sense', 'exalted', 'self-worth', 'Holly', 'Sedgwick', 'lacked', 'talent', 'sustain', 'film', 'career', 'script', 'Miller', 'own', 'devices', 'connecting', 'character', 'tormented', 'psyche', 'escalating', 'drug', 'use', 'upside', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'accurately', 'discomfiting', 'public', 'image', 'Warhol', 'down', 'familiar', 'narcissistic', 'indifference', 'manipulative', 'shyness', 'character', 'gradually', 'background', 'first', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'amateurish', 'unintentionally', 'amusing', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'doppelganger', 'especially', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'capturing', 'singer', 'recognizable', 'speech', 'cadences', 'Just', 'transcend', 'awkwardness', 'character', 'intrusion', 'story', 'also', 'making', 'impact', 'Sedgwick', 'life', 'feel', 'rather', 'fleeting.Even', 'cryptic', 'screenplay', 'Captain', 'Mauzner', 'Aaron', 'Richard', 'Golub', 'Simon', 'Monjack', 'conveniently', 'Warhol', 'faux-Dylan', 'polarizing', 'figures', 'pulling', 'Sedgwick', 'soul', 'story', 'really', 'down', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'problem', 'oddly', 'elliptical', 'Hickenlooper', 'satisfied', 'leaving', 'impressionistic', 'view', 'person', 'who', 'barely', 'warrants', 'attention', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'quite', 'familiar', 'Ileana', 'Douglas', 'Vogue', 'editor', 'Diana', 'Vreeland', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'Sedgwick', 'confidante', 'Chuck', 'Wein', 'Tara', 'Summers', 'fellow', 'Warhol', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Brigid', 'Berlin', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Brigid', 'sister', 'Richie', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'family', 'attorney', 'Mary', 'Kate', 'Olsen', 'partygoer', 'However', 'none', 'are', 'given', 'opportunity', 'shine.The', '2007', 'DVD', 'several', 'extras', 'varying', 'interest', 'best', 'being', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'track', 'Hickenlooper', 'thirty-minute', 'documentary', 'life', 'real', 'Sedgwick', 'main', 'film', 'stylistic', 'touches', 'also', 'bland', 'ten-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'scene', 'was', 'understandably', 'excised', 'audition', 'footage', 'Miller', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'twenty-minute', 'behind-the-scenes', 'video', 'diary', 'coordinated', 'Pearce', 'strong', 'work', 'Miller', 'Pearce', 'film', 'only', 'marginally', 'effective', 'dramatic', 'vehicle', 'even', 'Hickenlooper', 'viscerally', 'fascinating', 'period', 'history', 'arts', 'scene']",N/A

Movies about the lives of famous people allow us to open the door to their life-time choices and it was sad to see the trajectory of Edith Minturn Sedgwick, known by all her friends as ""Edie.""Born on April 20th, 1943 to a wealthy family, Edie was the daughter of Alice Delano de Forest and Francis Minturn Sedgwick, who was a sculptor, philanthropist and rancher. Edie came from a well established family in Massachusetts, but her parents had moved to California, where she is born in Santa Barbara. Her ancestors can be traced back to her seventh grandfather, who was the first Major General of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.At the early age of 22, she meets Andy Warhol and begins a relationship with him, appearing in many of his movies, becoming a regular at The Factory, the studio where Warhol met with associates and friends while pursuing his endeavors. Andrew Warhol was born on August 6th, 1928, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, so when he met Edie he was in his late 30's. Andy started his career as a commercial illustrator and soon became famous for his work as a painter and his unique pop art, the name given to his 60's paintings of American products such as Campbell's Soup and Coca Cola cans.The movie shows an insecure, troubled young woman, who involves herself in drug use which ultimately causes her demise. At some point, she meets Bob Dylan, an American song writer, author, poet and guitar player, but Andy Warhol becomes either jealous or resentful and he stops devoting his attention to Edie, who can not understand the motives behind his abandonment and loses control of herself.The movie is well done, providing great detail into the lives of people we did not know much about, but the story of Edie Sedgwick left us saddened to see a young girl with great promise deteriorate to the point of self-destruction.

I'll have to give it:5 stars for the acting of Guy Pearce in the role of Andy Warhol. Better than Hoffman as Capote, better than Penn as Milk. Warhol was the creepiest narcissist that ever lived, and Pearce captures every loathsome mannerism. More than that, he exposes Warhol's coy cruelty and voyeuristic sadism for what they were, an accidental confluence of lustrous perversity with perverse times.4 stars for the acting of Sienna Miller as Edie Sedgwick--and everyone else except Hayden Christensen as Bob Dylan. Miller does well enough with Sedgwick's tragic weaknesses but gives little impression of what might have made such a person compelling and alluring.3 stars for the sociological/historical portrayal of the Warhol ""factory"" and of the cultural scene in New York and America at large in the 1960s. The 24-7 bizarre goings-on, through which Warhol wafted like a lobotomized Intelligent Designer, are portrayed accurately, i.e. luridly, enough, but the sporadic efforts to give Warholia any broader context -- a few street scenes, a glance at events on TV -- are woefully insufficient. All that weirdness wasn't just drug-induced, much as it was drug-fueled. Is the lack of context automatically a flaw? I suppose not, but it made the sorry life of Edie Sedgwick seem trivial and banal. I'm not entirely impartial, however. I had a close friend, a college classmate, who was chewed up and destroyed - murdered, in fact - by the Warhol film 'industry'.2 stars for the script, if there was one. The timing was never quite right. Some scenes seemed bloated, some were sketchy. Perhaps the effect was intentional, a sloppy improvisation approximating the cloying vacuity of Warhol's own films. But here's the rub: Hollywood can't simulate an independent film, just as money can't buy true squalor.1 star for the acting of Hayden Christensen as Bob Dylan, not only because he didn't resemble Dylan in style or substance but also because he was dismally implausible as any kind of human being. Besides, the 'true story' aspect of this production was sacrificed opportunistically; it made a better marketing package to focus on Dylan as Edie's lover, but in fact no biggie occurred between them, according to mutual friends. One of Dylan's entourage was the real 'intruder' in the Warhol menage.I had a choice of films... six or seven vampire flicks, and a slew of celebrity rise-and-falls all strung out on lines of drug abuse.

For this reviewer there are some strong points in this film about an almost indescribable time in our history that helps clarify points about Andy Warhol and his significance on the art scene. And one of those points is made more clear by the film's refusal to make Warhol the central character.  This is Edie Sedgwick's story and it is told in a manner compatible with the times in which it took place.Director George Hickenlooper, using a story/screenplay by Aaron Richard Golub, Captain Mauzner and Simon Monjack, elects to tell this pseudobiopic in the form of interviews and flashbacks, beginning with an interview of the makeup-less Edie Sedgwick (Sienna Miller) speaking to a reporter in a hospital, some time after her extended 15 minutes of fame.  Edie was a wealthy beautiful but psychologically and physically damaged art student from am important, albeit extraordinarily dysfunctional, family an escaped to New York where she was taken in by the newly fashionable Pop artist Andy Warhol (Guy Pearce) and made a member of his bizarre family who lived in The Factory.  Warhol made films (probably some of the worst ever made...) and promised fame to Edie. But Edie spent all her wealth on parties and drugs and broken promises of fame, fell in love with an unnamed folk singer (Hayden Christensen - very shallowly imitating Bob Dylan), and eventually fell out with the world and into the realm of drug addiction.  All the while Andy Warhol remained the enigmatic weird artist whose relationship to the world was distorted at best. The films walks through some raunchy scenes, some glimpses of Warhol's infamous silkscreens of pop objects, and offers a chance for a fairly secure cast of actors to draw some of the people who lived in the factory - actors including Jack Huston, Jimmy Fallon, Shawn Hatosy, Mena Suvari - and those who were outside the 'temple' - actors such as James Naughton,  Beth Grant, Edward Hermann and Ileana Douglas as Diana Vreeland.Yes, there are holes in the script and the film feels like a bad hangover at times, but for this viewer the acting of Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce make the film worthwhile.

1061096,A19552QR80XTOX,B000NVT0S4,Jungle Red,"[15, 16]","I have been a huge fan of Edie Sedgwick for the last fourteen years. I was very excited when I heard that a ""real"" studio was actually going to try to make a biopic about Edie. That excitement began to wane when reports that actual Factory cohorts thought the idea of the film itself was disgusting. Turns out that the old Factory crew was spot on. This movie couldn't be further from Edie's actual life.Having poured over Edie's classic biography (Edie: An American Girl), it is more than apparent that the filmmakers took ""artistic liberties"" to new heights. What they couldn't find to be true, they made up. Timelines don't always make sense and people who weren't even that involved in Edie's life take center stage. That said, Sienna Miller's portrayal of Edie is quite good. In fact, the only redeeming quality in the movie is Miller's spot on impersonation of Edie - the girl did her research. Too bad the script (which was presumably written by a few people) wasn't as well researched.My real problem with this movies lies with one thing - the character ""Billy Quinn"" (who is simply credited as ""musician""). Hayden Christensen portrays ""Quinn"" as a thinly veiled Bob Dylan-esque musician who tries to show Edie the shallowness of the Warhol Factory and ultimately becomes the thing that tears Edie and Warhol apart. Anyone that read anything about this film before (or after) seeing it knows that Dylan repeatedly denied being involved with Edie and threatened to sue if he was portrayed in the film. Instead of getting rid of the character completely, the director instead decided to keep him, give a new name and carry on. I don't believe anyone was fooled or didn't guess whom Christensen was actually playing.While I understand that biopics are rarely full of all truths, there is simply  no proof that Edie was romantically involved with Bob Dylan. In fact it has been suggested that any sort of romance between Edie and Dylan was probably more of a one-sided figment of Edie's imagination. Whatever the real story is, I found the whole concept of the character to be uncomfortable. I suppose the filmmakers thought that Edie having an affair with the notoriously private Dylan was much more interesting than the real life affair she had with the less famous Bob Neuwirth (Dylan's best friend at the time).Edie's real reason for leaving the Factory had more do to with her drug use and the fact that she felt she should try to shoot for real stardom. Instead, ""Factory Girl"" portrays Edie as a somewhat helpless girl who is caught between two powerful men from two very different worlds, both of which she wants to belong to. As flawed as Edie was one thing is certain, she did what she wanted when she wanted. Her decision to leave the Factory was most likely her own (she stated at various times that she wanted Warhol to pay her for her work in his films) and likely wasn't based on the affection of any man. The fact that the filmmakers sunk to such depths to get the story they wanted, no matter how untrue it was, is what is the most insulting. I'd rather no movie be made about Edie than the lies and fabrications that made up ""Factory Girl"".If you're interested in finding out more about Edie, don't rely on this movie. Instead, read the few books that cover her life and go on facts, not rumors or hearsay. Edie might have been a cultural footnote, but everyone deserves to have their story told in the most honest way possible. ""Factory Girl"" fails on all fronts and only goes to show that as years go by, people think they can just reinvent history to suit them.The sad thing is, a few of Edie's family members (her widower, who appears as a taxi driver in one scene, and her sole surviving brother Jonathan) participated in the film.

I thought it was empty and indulgent, but that doesn't mean I couldn't have rated it higher than just two stars.  The film is about Andy Warhol muse Edie Sedgewick.  I knew it got some mixed but mostly poor reviews, but that doesn't mean a whole lot to me.  However, I also heard that Bob Dylan was threatening with legal action over the idea that his likeness in the film (credited as ""the musician"") was in any way accountable for Edie's tragic death.  Furthermore, Lou Reed, the lead singer of the Velvet Underground, was upset with the production altogether.  He called the script ""foul"" and ""disgusting"".  He isn't too far off actually, but then again I didn't live within the real life story like Reed did, so what do I know?  It really made me wonder what Nico or Andy Warhol himself might have said had they been alive today.Factory Girl covers the young socialite's period in her life as she rises amongst the ranks of Warhol's underground film stars and then descends to drug addiction.  Sienna Miller plays Edie and really can't be blamed.  There are flashes of solid work here for Miller and I actually give her a lot of credit for sticking to it in such a bad movie.  Guy Pearce does a decent, albeit superficial, imitation of Andy Warhol.  The thing is, I never respected Warhol's work that much anyway and his followers always came off as a bit too ostentatious to me.  Besides, his movies truly are the epitome of trash.  I suppose there is no way to not sound offensive in saying all of that but I mention it to demonstrate my perspective going into this film.  If you like and are interested in this little subculture then I am sure you may like this movie more for that.It was directed by George Hickenlooper.  He directed the very goodDogtowna decade ago but has since done some pretty obscure stuff.  I really can't tell what he was aiming for here but it is far from a successful return to the mainstream.  He did a movie a few years ago calledThe Man from Elysian Fieldswhich I actually loved very much even though it was not widely acclaimed. I don't blame Hickenlooper here because this film's flaws do not necessarily appear directorial in nature.  It is a rushed production and it is very poorly written.

While it may not completely explain or try to explain why Edie did what she did it is a very well done movie. The acting, especially by Sienna Miller is very good (even if you wonder why she got the role when you see some of her screen test passages in the extras).At times the physical resemblance with the real Edie is exceptional, or at least with pictures from that era. Basically Edie was a wealthy New England socialite who left art school to go to New York where she met Andy Warhol- Being spectacularly attractive she became famous for the famous Warholian 15 minutes and then became very involved in drugs and eventually died at 28 years of age. However she has with time becom an icon of the 60's. This was confirmed by a book hat came out a while ago by Jean Stein and which is quite an excellent read.The extras are rather good since there is a short documentary about the real Edie with interviews of survivors who knew her such as Gerard Malanga and her brother. This series of interviews actually complement the movie quite well. Together with the above mentioned book it increases the fascination one can have for her.

This true story focuses on her life with Andy Warhol (Guy Pearce) and his ""Factory"" that produced underground films, as well as his more famous artwork.The actors do fantastic jobs of getting inside the characters and showing the indulgent pampering of the 1960's Dr. Spock generation.  New York has bright lights and possibilities for all the characters and Edie wants to be somebody and everybody wanted to be her - a lively selfish pampered sprite-muse.  She did underground movies and for a year she was Andy Warhol's ""It"" girl.  Although many blame Andy for her drug use, mental problems and fall from fame, she never understood she caused her problems.  Edie could not escape reality through drugs and delusions. She came from a rich, old money family with a history of mental illness.  Edie was in some ways like Marilyn Monroe - a child-like trust and hope that she could depend on friends for her happiness.  She had personality, but in the end money is the bottom line.  She had no concept of what was real and based her worth on what others thought of her. It turns out her friends were opportunists, including Andy, they took everything from her, including self-respect.  Her trust money was spent in less than a year of parties, meals out and drugs.  After much drama Edie ended up in a drug treatment facility and eventually died at the young age of 28.There could have been more insight into her sad life story - I don't think everything can be blamed on Warhol.

The ostensible muse and poseur artist are a match made in hell, each feeding off the other until one is eaten alive by fame.This is a rich, detailed film worthy of repeated viewings. With the exceptions of Hayden Christensen (especially disappointing considering his award-worthy work in ""Shattered Glass"") and Jimmy Fallon (is it possible to be less than one-dimensional? If so, Fallon has the secret), the casting could not have been better. Artful use of different film stocks helps to set the scene. The attention to detail pays enormous dividends as a powerful emotional story unfolds.DVD extras are magnificent: an insightful biography of the real-life Edie includes commentary from dozens of survivors, Guy Pearce's video diary is an enlightening look behind the scenes, and Sienna Miller's audition tape is remarkable for the mere hint it offers of her superb work in the finished film.For younger audiences, it's a fascinating look into the beginnings of the days when fame first became its own reward.

Sienna Miller's range as an actress in the part was really amazing to see. She had to be many different things at once and she managed to pull it all off almost effortlessly.The other thing I want to say though is that this is a story. It should not be taken as the ""truth"" of Edie Sedgwick or Andy Warhol's life. Both were so much creatures of image and the media that its impossible to ever really know either of them in a definitive way. The use of a faux Bob Dylan as some sort of superior moral figure was a bad idea. What the film deliberately missed was that Dylan and Warhol were more alike in how they used people and struck a pose than how they were different. If Warhol was the fake/con-man as artist, Dylan was the fake/con-man as poet. And to suggest as the film does that Dylan of that year was any cleaner than Edie is absurd.The film misses a number of key events in the lives of the people featured. It misses the decline of the factory crowd and ultimately Warhol being shot. It misses Dylan's motorcycle ""accident"". It also gives a wrong impression of how brief Edie's factory period was. Its a very good film, but it could have been better if it had covered the broader landscape of what was happening.The film also doesn't quite capture the decline of the Factory from 1965 to 1968. It wasn't just Edie who went into decline as depicted in the film. Almost everyone in that crowd did along with the Chelsea hotel.Two other comments. There is unusual amount of smoking in the film. There is a line between incidental smoking in a film and a film so full of smoking scenes that its really noticable. Factory girl is in the later catagory.

Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Factory Girl tells the story of how young Edie Sedgwick, a Cambridge art school student who came to New York for fun and excitement--and fame--entered the world of Andy Warhol in the mid 1960s. The plot moves along at a very good pace; I never felt bored--indeed, I was fascinated by the character development even when it wasn't pretty. The script was well written and the acting was good although Hayden Christensen could have been a little more convincing in some of his scenes. In addition, the choreography and the cinematography work wonders for this film.Edie Sedgwick was a young woman from an ""old money"" family with distinguished lawyers and a signer of the Declaration of Independence to boot. Unfortunately, however, the same family had almost always abused Edie since her childhood even if her claims about her father were false; her family wasn't exactly the kindest or the most forgiving.When Edie (Sienna Miller) and Andy Warhol (Guy Pearce) meet for the first time at a Manhattan art show party, Andy is absolutely struck with Edie's beauty and her lack of inhibition as she dances while he watches her. It isn't long before Edie enters Andy's world and she becomes very close friends with Andy as well as some of his artistic friends who are ""fringe elements,"" as Edie's accountant puts it. The group usually works together in what was a hat factory; hence Andy Warhol always called the studio ""The Factory"" and Edie became a ""Factory Girl.""Edie's rise to stardom and her subsequent fall are depicted with a reasonable amount of empathy for her character; the film accurately portrays Edie as being a rather nave young woman who became involved with some people who ultimately took advantage of her.I won't spoil the rest for you; but suffice it to say that Edie's rise to fame eventually teaches her the lesson that fame has its price; and her relationship with a musician whose character is pretty clearly based on Bob Dylan (Hayden Christensen) certainly has its plusses and minuses.The DVD comes with an excellent featurette entitled ""The Real Edie"" and we get an optional running commentary with director George Hickenlooper. There is footage of Sienna Miller's audition for the role of Edie Sedgwick and more including ""Making Factory Girl.""I recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who like biographical dramas will not be disappointed.",4,"""You're the boss, applesauce...""",1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,2382,"['Factory', 'Girl', 'story', 'how', 'young', 'Edie', 'Sedgwick', 'Cambridge', 'art', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'came', 'New', 'York', 'fun', 'excitement', 'fame', 'entered', 'world', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'mid', '1960s', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'never', 'felt', 'bored', 'indeed', 'was', 'fascinated', 'character', 'development', 'even', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'script', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'convincing', 'scenes', 'addition', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'work', 'wonders', 'film.Edie', 'Sedgwick', 'was', 'young', 'woman', 'old', 'money', 'family', 'distinguished', 'lawyers', 'signer', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'boot', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'same', 'family', 'had', 'almost', 'always', 'abused', 'Edie', 'childhood', 'even', 'claims', 'father', 'were', 'false', 'family', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'kindest', 'most', 'forgiving.When', 'Edie', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'Manhattan', 'art', 'show', 'party', 'Andy', 'absolutely', 'struck', 'Edie', 'beauty', 'lack', 'inhibition', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Edie', 'Andy', 'world', 'very', 'close', 'friends', 'Andy', 'as', 'well', 'artistic', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'fringe', 'elements', 'Edie', 'accountant', 'group', 'usually', 'together', 'what', 'was', 'hat', 'factory', 'hence', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'always', 'called', 'studio', 'Factory', 'Edie', 'became', 'Factory', 'Girl', 'Edie', 'rise', 'stardom', 'subsequent', 'fall', 'are', 'depicted', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'empathy', 'character', 'film', 'accurately', 'Edie', 'being', 'rather', 'nave', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'became', 'involved', 'people', 'who', 'ultimately', 'took', 'advantage', 'her.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'rest', 'say', 'Edie', 'rise', 'fame', 'eventually', 'lesson', 'fame', 'price', 'relationship', 'musician', 'character', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'based', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'certainly', 'plusses', 'minuses.The', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Real', 'Edie', 'get', 'optional', 'running', 'commentary', 'director', 'George', 'Hickenlooper', 'footage', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'audition', 'role', 'Edie', 'Sedgwick', 'more', 'including', 'Making', 'Factory', 'Girl', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'actors', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'biographical', 'dramas', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

She does the same in this too, there are quite a few scenes where Edie seems to live in her underwear, but there's almost a certain innocence to it somehow.Sienna Miller is of course more well known for her personal life these days, than her film career, and people seem to forget that. This is actually the first film I've seen of hers since Layer Cake, and was surprised when she was actually really good. It shows a great actor when you forget who they really are, they manage to become that character. It would have been especially hard to become such a tortured character like Edie Sedgewick was.The film is basically centred around Edie's short life. Interspersed with scenes of Edie being interviewed when she's in rehab I think? Those scenes were the only parts I didn't like, as it didn't seem to add anything to the movie.Guy Pearce who plays Andy Warhol in this, was the weirdest character. He actually gave me the shivers watching him on screen. I don't really know anything about Andy Warhol (or Edie Sedgewick for that matter) and the apparent similarities between Hayden Christensen's character and Bob Dylan I didn't notice. Really, this was a blind impulse buy.For anyone who wasn't from the era this movie was based in, like me, won't really know the music. It didn't really do anything for me, add to the movie or anything. The fashion was cool, but I've seen better. It didn't really scream sixties if you know what I mean?Overall, Factory Girl was a good little movie, not too long, not too short, quite sad towards the end, and with a couple of interesting features. But I finished it feeling I hadn't really found out anything about Edie Sedgewick.

I had always known who Edie Sedgwick was, as she rode Andy Warhol's coattails, but I knew very little about her.  This movie proved to me that she was exactly that, just a footnote to pop culture history.Edie came from a privilaged yet dysfunctional family.  In the special features we see a short documentary on Edie giving insights into her family life, interviewed by her brother and only living relative.  Mom was in and out of the pysch hospital, Dad may or may not have molested her.  Edie left college when she met Andy, and he quickly became his muse.  Overnight, Edie was the It Girl - the one every woman wanted to be and every man wanted to have - one of the original Warhol Superstars.  They made the scene, famous for being famous (much like Paris Hilton and her counterparts would do years later on a much larger scale), and didn't seem to have much direction in life.And then, true to Warhol's famous phrase that in the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes, Edie had her 15 minutes.  And that, quite simply, was It.  There is always someone else fresher, younger, prettier, and just as eager to be part of the scene who is just on the rise.  Edie found herself pushed aside by Andy and the others in the scene, as they were moving on to other things.  What do you do with yourself now?  Edie didn't know.  Her affair with the musician went nowhere, Andy seemed jealous and unforgiving that she would leave him for another, and he turned his back on her.  Was he the villan?  Not really.  This world of glam and ab fab parties are superficial at best.  Andy was a celebrity, and once he rose he had to keep playing the game to stay famous.  He just moved on to other things, like we all do.  And Edie, like a lot of people who have no idea what they want to do and lack the intelligence, strength and value to know that there is more to life than just self medication, end up addicted and alone because they thought it was so cool.  Edie would go on to a psych hospital in California, where she would marry a fellow patient, then die of an overdose.  End of story.Enjoy this movie for the scenery, wardrobe and make up, but if you're looking for substance, you won't find much here.  Then again, that's the point.",3,That was the It Girl ...

It's not going to give you a slimy, desperate Andy Warhol like Oliver Stone's.  It's gonna give you a realistic impression of who Andy was, and I like it!Let's face it, in many ways the early 60's were boring. Things weren't happening fast enough, and many young people felt isolated. They were waffling around for something to do, struggling to get more psychologically honest, and Warhol was in his 30's, wanting to create a ""happening"".Warhol saw that potential in Edie Sedgwick, only to become acutely aware - she was damaged goods.  Guy Pearce as Warhol here gives a stunning portrayal.  Sienna Miller is left floating with very little dialog, but makes it work.  Maybe that's how the real Edie was - just a young fledging with not a lot of substance, but money...  Money that enabled her to do a few things (in spite of the suicides of her brothers and the incest from her father).  These are rough topics which have to be handled with subtlety in film.I thought this story was great!  It showed a self-destructive girl reaching out to a man (Andy Warhol) who had an innate understanding of the differences between preservation and destruction.  Let's not forget, he was also young.  He was probably struggling with how to help her handle her neediness...  Such is the case for victims of sexual abuse.  He knew, any money given to her would be used for drugs.  So, he didn't do it.  I like the scenes here where Warhol goes to confession and tries to work out his confusion with the priest.Warhol was in a bind with this girl...  In the same way a landlord would be legally accountable for taking money from drug sales as a rent payment.  I don't think he was cruel, I think he was smart.  There are hundreds of Edie's on our international streets every day.  This one just happened to meet someone who gave her attention without being possessive or controlling.  Warhol and Sedgwick were star-crossed; she was able to articulate some things he already knew in his own heart, but repressed.  The love was there, but it had no real chance.  She needed rescue, and Andy was not an enabler.I think this film could have really become a 5-star piece had a dynamic actor been chosen to play the role of Bob Dylan; but the chemistry just was not there.  I also do not perceive Andy's mother as being a dried-up old hag, so much as a funny kitchen-witch of a character in life.

The characters are pulled off perfectly and work very well together to capture the life of this troubled woman.If you go into this movie knowing nothing of Warhol or Sedwick, that's ok. It explains it very well. As another reviewer said, it is not the full life of Edie Sedgwick. It is basicly her life when she meets and starts working with Andy Warhol, and then when she leaves him. If you know any of the history of her life, it is not very happy. With her depression and drug use, she really struggled through life. So the movie does get a little depressing towards the end of the film.I gave this movie four stars because of an awesome cast. Awesome acting. Awesome true story.

Both are troubled - Andy is gay and Edie has hard time overcoming her sexual inhibitions.  Andy and Edie are both emotionally damaged goods.  The difference between them is the difference in their social status.  Edie is from rich family raised in priviledge and beauty all around her.  Her family has high expectations of her.  But her sensitivity to the world around her and particularly her family are debilitating to the point that her only relief are drugs.  So it is natural progression for her to retrieve to the world of artists and musicians where she meets Andy Warhol.  Andy on the other hand is son of immigrants raised on the opposite side of the social spectrum.  He is fascinated with Edie who is rich, beautiful, unassuming, trusting and vulnerable.  He uses girl from the ""old money"" world into his art work that mocks the world as it is.  It is sad to witness how Edie is being used by people she surrounded herself with.  She is so desparate for acceptance that she does not realize that she is being used by the hangers-on that inhabit Andy's world. Her one chance to escape all that is ruined by her own choices that eventually seal her faith and lead her to her death.  Guy Piece is totally creepy in his role of Andy Warhol.  Andy is so supressed and self-centered that he is impossible to be liked in spite of his contribution to the art.  Andy is no different from capitalistic world around him, he uses people and then tosses them out when they fall out of his favor, or no longer satisfy his imagination.  But Edie on the other hand, is innocence lost, little rich girl who was always taken care of by her heritage and her parents.  And when that was no longer available to her, she simply dies.  It is almost as if once her fragile little being, lost its purpose (family pet, artist's muse, musician's lover) she disappears from this world for good.  Her pain is so intense, that no one else could live a minute more on this earth living the kind of life that she herself has experienced.

It's definitely a great place to start to peak your interest in the story of Andy and Edie, and the tragedy of Edie's life.Edie was a blue-blood from an important family, an artist who wanted to explore the big city of New York.  She meets Andy Warhol and the two become fast friends.  Andy sees in Edie something he can use, and stars Edie is several of his underground movies.  The two of them became a sensation, and Edie was suddenly a sweetheart of the New York art scene.  Exposure to the wild and willing deviance of Warhol's Factory soon led to Edie's use of drugs.  Her trust fund was running low.  Then Edie meets Billy Quinn (in real life it was Bob Dylan).Warhol disapproved of Edie's relationship with Quinn (Dylan) and began to shun her.  Edie was devastated by the estrangement of Warhol, her best friend, so she chose Warhol over Quinn, only to discover that Warhol had already written her off as yesterday's news.  Edie spiraled into her drug addiction, her trust fund ran out, and her relationship with her rigid parents was already strained past the breaking point.  She had no where to go and no one to turn to.  Except drugs.'Factory Girl' is a well-done film.  Sienna Miller as Edie was perky and perfect for the role.  Hayden Christianson was above his usual performances as Billy Quinn.  Guy Pearce was stunningly perfect as Andy Warhol, and watch for SNL's Jimmy Fallon as Edie's friend Chuck Wein.  The acting was excellent, the atmosphere captured the 60's, and the photography added that tiny bit of craziness that inundated the era.  The movie woke my interest in the Factory, and I was recommended two books, ""Edie: American Girl"" by Jean Stein and ""Factory Made: Warhol And The Sixties"" by Steven Watson.If this subject fascinates you at all, 'Factory Girl' is a great place to start.

1061124,A14ADG0TTI4XBV,B000NVT0S4,"Scott Coblio ""kookoo guy""","[10, 12]","Personally, I'm glad the movie focuses only on 1965-1966, when Edie rose and fell with equal velocity. The script is flawed, but not fatally. Sienna Miller manages to evoke Edie--her intelligence, her smoky voice and aristocratic origins, her wry pixie humor. What the film doesn't have time to explore is her complexity. I could have done without the Bob Dylan character--it's corny, as well as inaccurate-- in real life Dylan had little to do with her rise or fall. It was Bob Neuworth, Dylan's sidekick, that transfixed her. In place of the Dylan subplot, I would rather have seen more solo Edie hitting the party circuit, making films, doing fashion spreads, conquering the media Guerilla style. That would have given Sienna Miller a chance to show more of Edie's strength and pizazz.In ""Factory Girl"", Edie's turnabout from happy Queen of Warhol's Factory to ousted junkie is a little too sudden. One or two more transition scenes would have helped.  The film depicts Edie's downfall as a result of  failed romance & her oust from the Warhol set, but this appears to be innacurate. From what I have read, her ruin was really  built into her psychological makeup, it seems. All the demons of her childhood and resulting lack of self esteem (combined-as so often in these ""charismatic trainwreck"" types--with a huge ego), seem to have created a timebomb, inevitably counting backwards to zero. But she was a beautiful and compelling timebomb,  a butterfly captured--temporarily--and studied through Warhol's lens. Andy got the exclusive on her--for she fell apart almost immediately after she stopped appearing in his movies.Aside from some fashion modelling and the movie ""Ciao! Manhattan""--a painful attempt to either resurrect her or capture and exploit her death throes (for she really was dying on film here, spiritually if not physically--and was dead of an overdose only months after filming wrapped), Edie remains otherwise undocumented on celluloid-- flickering through the rest of time in Warhol's unseen vaults. One wonders why the Warhol Estate doesn't release them now that ""Factory Girl"" is becoming a sleeper hit on DVD. Boxset, anyone?More than being a model or a movie star though, Edie's real gift seems to have been more of a live phenomenon--as is evidenced by the countless testimonials of those she bewitched or enchanted in person. Yes, she was beautiful (check out the Girl on Fire book if you are in any doubt of her considerable physical charm). She was also intelligent--something that might surprise the uninformed skeptic. And inspite of her exasperating insistence on self-destruction, she was magical. And she made those she touched feel magical too. In a world that seems to be turning more apocalyptic each day, being society's Tinkerbell just may be a more significant achievement than being a good actress.  I give props to the film makers for evoking some of Edie's magic then, in this imperfect but interesting and rewatchable study.",3,Edie Lite,1184630400,"07 17, 2007",2007,2973,"['Personally', ""'m"", 'glad', 'movie', 'only', '1965-1966', 'when', 'Edie', 'rose', 'fell', 'equal', 'velocity', 'script', 'flawed', 'not', 'fatally', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'evoke', 'Edie', 'intelligence', 'smoky', 'voice', 'aristocratic', 'origins', 'wry', 'pixie', 'humor', 'What', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'explore', 'complexity', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'character', 'corny', 'as', 'well', 'inaccurate', 'real', 'life', 'Dylan', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'rise', 'fall', 'was', 'Bob', 'Neuworth', 'Dylan', 'sidekick', 'transfixed', 'place', 'Dylan', 'subplot', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'solo', 'Edie', 'hitting', 'party', 'circuit', 'making', 'films', 'doing', 'fashion', 'spreads', 'conquering', 'media', 'Guerilla', 'style', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'chance', 'show', 'more', 'Edie', 'strength', 'pizazz.In', 'Factory', 'Girl', 'Edie', 'turnabout', 'happy', 'Queen', 'Warhol', 'Factory', 'ousted', 'junkie', 'little', 'too', 'sudden', 'One', 'two', 'more', 'transition', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'film', 'Edie', 'downfall', 'result', 'failed', 'romance', 'oust', 'Warhol', 'set', 'be', 'innacurate', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'ruin', 'was', 'really', 'built', 'psychological', 'makeup', 'demons', 'childhood', 'resulting', 'lack', 'self', 'esteem', 'combined-as', 'so', 'often', 'charismatic', 'trainwreck', 'types', 'huge', 'ego', 'seem', 'have', 'created', 'timebomb', 'inevitably', 'counting', 'backwards', 'zero', 'was', 'beautiful', 'compelling', 'timebomb', 'butterfly', 'captured', 'temporarily', 'studied', 'Warhol', 'lens', 'Andy', 'got', 'exclusive', 'fell', 'apart', 'almost', 'immediately', 'stopped', 'appearing', 'movies.Aside', 'fashion', 'modelling', 'movie', 'Ciao', 'Manhattan', 'painful', 'attempt', 'resurrect', 'capture', 'exploit', 'death', 'throes', 'really', 'was', 'dying', 'film', 'here', 'spiritually', 'not', 'physically', 'was', 'dead', 'overdose', 'only', 'months', 'filming', 'wrapped', 'Edie', 'otherwise', 'undocumented', 'celluloid', 'flickering', 'rest', 'time', 'Warhol', 'unseen', 'vaults', 'One', 'why', 'Warhol', 'Estate', ""n't"", 'release', 'now', 'Factory', 'Girl', 'becoming', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'DVD', 'Boxset', 'anyone', 'More', 'being', 'model', 'movie', 'star', 'Edie', 'real', 'gift', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'live', 'phenomenon', 'evidenced', 'countless', 'testimonials', 'bewitched', 'enchanted', 'person', 'Yes', 'was', 'beautiful', 'check', 'out', 'Girl', 'Fire', 'book', 'are', 'doubt', 'considerable', 'physical', 'charm', 'was', 'also', 'intelligent', 'something', 'might', 'surprise', 'uninformed', 'skeptic', 'inspite', 'exasperating', 'insistence', 'self-destruction', 'was', 'magical', 'made', 'touched', 'feel', 'magical', 'too', 'world', 'be', 'turning', 'more', 'apocalyptic', 'day', 'being', 'society', 'Tinkerbell', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'significant', 'achievement', 'being', 'good', 'actress', 'give', 'props', 'film', 'makers', 'evoking', 'Edie', 'magic', 'then', 'imperfect', 'interesting', 'rewatchable', 'study']",N/A

This movie was interesting in part because I had never heard of Edie Sedgwick, and in part because this is the first film I've seen about an artist who never achieved fame outside of her connection to Warhol, and therefore was much more about life inside the factory.  Paradoxically, this may be why this one missed the fifth star for me.  With the main character never really becoming her own person, her ultimate demise felt just a little anticlimactic.That being said, I thought the acting was very good all around, and the film avoids oversimplification in at least two fairly significant ways.  First, even though Andy comes off very badly, as he almost always does, he is at least portrayed as being opposed to, unhappy with, and trying to prevent Edie's (and everyone else's) drug use, albeit ineffectually.  And second, one of Edie's &#34;friends&#34; shown in a live interview at the end of the film wringing her hands about how hard it was to help Edie is portrayed in an early scene giving tacit encouragement and a nod of approval the first time Edie tries intravenous drugs.

It was basically little excerpts of the book (they even copy certain poses of her photos, like after the Chelsea fire) with some made-up stuff thrown in. Sort of a riches - to - rags theme.Edie (Sienna Miller) is all happy-happy and on her way to New York to become an artist.  However she attends a a party as she is wont to do and is introduced to Andy Warhol (Guy Pearce) who turns her head and puts her in movies, supposedly promising to pay her, but he never pays her. She runs up thousands in bills (but it doesn't show this), always assuming her trust fund will never run out.She meets Bob Dylan or ""the musician"" and falls madly in love and they have a soulful connection (he throws his motorcycle in the water to prove it doesn't mean anything to him).  The musician wants to take her away from all the madness that is Andy Warhol's Factory, but Edie chooses Andy instead and later (supposedly) tells an interviewer it was the worst decision she ever made. Yeah, right. Bob Dylan was already married or engaged and he was not about to step in and solve all Edie's problems. Who could? She throws a big fit at Andy telling him he has turned her into this mess, but later says she made all her own choices. Make up your mind, Factory Girl Edie.Her mom (who never did anything about her father trying to molest her, or so she tells her lawyer when she is begging him for money to pay her rent, in a very phony-looking move) is portrayed as a proper society matron, but in American Girl she seemed like a frumpy fraidy cow.Sometimes Miller looks almost like Edie (the dimples help)...but sometimes she looked and sounded like Ally Sheedy in St. Elmo's Fire. (On the cover of the DVD, she looks like a blonde Katharine Ross.) Her voice is not like Edie's. Towards the end, she starts looking and sounding a LOT like Liza Minnelli - maybe it's the desperation.If you don't have it, don't buy it.  I thought it would be better, and explain more about how she ended up the way she did.

1061133,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000NVT0S4,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Factory Girl"" is not a terrible film. It is just strange. The film is supposed to be about Edie Sedgwick, a college dropout-turned-Andy Warhol's muse in the early 1960s, but what you remember after watching her tragic life story is not anything about her; it is Guy Pearce's chilling portrait of Andy Warhol as self-absorbed artist. For all Sienna Miller's strong acting as troubled Edie, ""Factory Girl"" does not get under the skin of the character for whom it has been made. It is as if Warhol is taking over her story.So many (possible) references to her in pop culture (especially music) suggest she has been still influential as cultural icon long after her early death, but George Hickenlooper's film never gets deeper than the top layer of the topic it deals with, going down the familiar course. Her romance with the ""Musician"" (Hayden Christensen impersonating Bob Dylan) leaves no impression on us. neither the supports from Jimmy Fallon, Mena Suvari, Shawn Hatosy, Edward Herrmann, Illeana Douglas and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.But I may be too harsh. Maybe her life story was really as familiar as anyone else's. If the film's Warhol seems taking over the story of Edie, maybe it is because that's exactly what happened to her. (One of the characters refers to him as a ""blood-sucking vampire."") Also, the film is filled with blurred images, split screen and other superficial camera works that only detract us from the purpose of the film: showing Edie as a person.In one scene of the film the ""Musician"" refers to the ""empty"" nature of Warhol's painting.
