331967,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,6302760003,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[0, 0]","Cass Timberlane is based on the the Sinclair Lewis novel of the same name. Lewis was an early 20th century writer who based many of his works in his native Minnesota.  The characters in his stories were often folksy midwestern types and his stories often center on life in a small town with traditional values.In this film, the plot revolves around a staid middle aged judge Cass Timberlane (Spencer Tracy) and his courtship and marriage to a twenty something Virginia (Ginny) Marshland (Lana Turner) who turns his staid and sedentary life upside down. Ginny is literally from what is deemed the 'wrong side of the tracks' and is grudgingly accepted into his country club crowd who snicker behind Timberlane's back about their May/December relationship. Ginny grows to hate the superficiality of life in a small town that is pervaded by snobbery. When a chance for a position with a NYC law firm comes Cass' way, Ginny pleads with Cass to leave Minnesota for the big city. Initially, Timberlane agrees to the move but realizes he wasn't made for city life and is comfortable with what he has always known. Complicating the Timberlanes marriage is Brad Crilley (played with snazzy erudition by  Zachary Scott) who befriends Ginny while also trying to seduce her. Along the way, the May/December marriage theme is played out while a variety of problems develop within the town's smart set which include fraud and a variety of illegalities, alcoholism, and general problems within families as well as small town life.Done in classic MGM style, the sets are well done and realistic. The cast is large and impressive with appearances by Albert Decker, Selena Royle, Margaret Lindsay, Tom Drake, Mary Astor, John Litel, Rose Hobart, Josephine Hutchinson, Mona Barrie, Cameron Mitchell, and even an unbilled appearance by Walter Pidgeon playing himself. Undoubtedly MGM lived by its motto 'more stars than there are in heaven'.Clearly, this is Tracy's film. As always, his performance is natural and understated as the very much in love jurist coping with unanticipated love when he least expects it.  Lana Turner plays Ginny with youthful enthusiasm and the hope that they will weather their future together until the stiffling realities set in.  Zachary Scott carries over the smug confidence of his Monte Barrigan character in Mildred Pierce to Brad Crilley.  I think Scott had a copywrite on this sophisticated cad role. Well acted and paced, the plot moves quickly and this is a film that is easy to get invested in.",4,Nice Adaptation,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,2514,"['Cass', 'Timberlane', 'based', 'Sinclair', 'Lewis', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Lewis', 'was', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'writer', 'who', 'based', 'many', 'works', 'native', 'Minnesota', 'characters', 'stories', 'were', 'often', 'folksy', 'midwestern', 'types', 'stories', 'often', 'center', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'traditional', 'values.In', 'film', 'plot', 'around', 'staid', 'middle', 'aged', 'judge', 'Cass', 'Timberlane', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'courtship', 'marriage', 'twenty', 'something', 'Virginia', 'Ginny', 'Marshland', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'who', 'staid', 'sedentary', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'Ginny', 'literally', 'what', 'deemed', ""'wrong"", 'side', 'tracks', 'grudgingly', 'accepted', 'country', 'club', 'crowd', 'who', 'snicker', 'Timberlane', 'back', 'May/December', 'relationship', 'Ginny', 'hate', 'superficiality', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'pervaded', 'snobbery', 'When', 'chance', 'position', 'NYC', 'law', 'firm', 'Cass', 'way', 'Ginny', 'Cass', 'leave', 'Minnesota', 'big', 'city', 'Initially', 'Timberlane', 'move', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'city', 'life', 'comfortable', 'what', 'always', 'known', 'Complicating', 'Timberlanes', 'marriage', 'Brad', 'Crilley', 'played', 'snazzy', 'erudition', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'who', 'Ginny', 'also', 'trying', 'seduce', 'way', 'May/December', 'marriage', 'theme', 'played', 'out', 'variety', 'problems', 'develop', 'town', 'smart', 'set', 'include', 'fraud', 'variety', 'illegalities', 'alcoholism', 'general', 'problems', 'families', 'as', 'well', 'small', 'town', 'life.Done', 'classic', 'MGM', 'style', 'sets', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'realistic', 'cast', 'large', 'impressive', 'appearances', 'Albert', 'Decker', 'Selena', 'Royle', 'Margaret', 'Lindsay', 'Tom', 'Drake', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'John', 'Litel', 'Rose', 'Hobart', 'Josephine', 'Hutchinson', 'Mona', 'Barrie', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'even', 'unbilled', 'appearance', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'playing', 'Undoubtedly', 'MGM', 'lived', 'motto', 'stars', 'are', ""heaven'.Clearly"", 'Tracy', 'film', 'always', 'performance', 'natural', 'understated', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'jurist', 'coping', 'unanticipated', 'love', 'when', 'least', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Ginny', 'youthful', 'enthusiasm', 'hope', 'will', 'weather', 'future', 'together', 'stiffling', 'realities', 'set', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'smug', 'confidence', 'Monte', 'Barrigan', 'character', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'Brad', 'Crilley', 'think', 'Scott', 'had', 'copywrite', 'sophisticated', 'cad', 'role', 'Well', 'acted', 'paced', 'plot', 'moves', 'quickly', 'film', 'easy', 'get', 'invested']",N/A

331974,A14OB7YKMPBJLW,6302760003,Susan Fong,"[7, 7]","""Cass Timberlane"" is a drama based on the novel by Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Sinclair Lewis.  The movie version of the novel follows the story of a beautiful and spirited working class girl, Virginia Marshland (winningly played by Lana Turner) who meets and falls in love with a respected judge, Cass Timberlane (earnestly portrayed by Spencer Tracy).Cass is a widower who first encounters Virginia, aka Ginny, on the witness stand.  Ginny is an artist.  After her testimony, she inadvertently leaves behind her sketchbook in the courtroom.  The sketches include one of Judge Timberlane as an angel clutching a gavel.  Someone finds the sketchbook and returns it to the judge. When Ginny sees the judge about recovering her artwork, Cass tells her that he is flattered and amused by her drawing of him.  Ginny gives the drawing to Cass, and he takes it home to proudly display on his mantle.Cass and Ginny next cross paths when Cass is visiting an area of town that he explored as a child.  As it happens, Ginny is the pitcher at a nearby baseball game.  Cass and Ginny accidentally meet again when a stray ball finds the judge.  Ginny persuades Cass to act as umpire in her baseball game.  The two hit it off.  Courtship and marriage follow.Ginny is truly in love with her new husband.  But she finds that most of his wealthy friends are snobbish and/or corrupt.  One of Cass' friends is a handsome single lawyer named Bradd Criley. Bradd has more than a slight interest in Ginny.  Zachary Scott portrays Bradd with appropriate amounts of shallowness, charm and a hint of menace.A tragic event, restlessness in Ginny, and external influences create strain in the Timberlane marriage. Can their union survive?Sinclair Lewis' realistic depiction of life in upper class suburbia is elegantly condensed by scenarist Donald Ogden Stewart (of ""Philadelphia Story"" fame).  A glamorous all-star ensemble led by Tracy and Turner, the direction by George Sidney, the photography, sets, costumes, and music score are all first rate in the great MGM tradition.By the way, pet lovers should also like this movie because of an irresistibly adorable tabby cat named Cleo who is part of the cast.  Cleo is a natural who manages to upstage larger-than-life legends Tracy and Turner whenever she shares a scene with them.
