1033521,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000KF0GWW,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[7, 8]","There are many dangers for being a member of the Coast Guard. Taken to the icy waters of the Bering Strait off the coast of Kodiak, Alaska, the possibilities of danger with choppy waves, hypothermia, and broken vessels or rocky caves rise exponentially. Dreadful decisions meet the rescuer at every opportunity to save lives: Who can and should be saved? Who cannot be? As in any lifesaving seminar, the rescuer must stay alive to be able to save others. Hazardous conditions and low pay are part and parcel of the harrowing life of heroes. These factors set up the premise of a promising movie.'The Guardian' shows us these possibilities with Ben Randall (Kevin Costner), a maverick, but aging senior chief who is still on top of his form. At the beginning we find him challenged by a rescue that runs out the clock and leaves his colleagues in harm's way. The descending rescue 'copter runs into a wave that sends it reeling into the sea where it explodes. The trajectory of the debacle sends Randall's best friend out at sea, but even his best efforts can't save him. Randall recovers, but he remains haunted by the memory of this recent disaster that left him impotent to save the others. His superior reassigns him to train recruits. He resists, but his senior officer is wise enough to know that trauma leaves even the best rescuers tentative until time can heal the inner wounds.At the training academy, Randall becomes the best asset, throwing away the text book and always throwing his recruits into the thick of training with some grueling situations. Here he comes upon a smug, but promising Ivy League recruit, Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher), properly nicknamed ""Goldfish"" for his smimming prowess and silver spoon sensibilities. The friction between instructor and recruit is not all that different than movies we've seen before, especially 'An Officer and a Gentleman,' but the bond they develop is both strong and very different. They discover they have much in common, including an aptitude to break swimming records and a past that haunts each protagonist in a similar fashion. Tough Randall has some strong words that quickly silence even the most brazen of his potential crew, especially the cocky Fischer. A series of mishaps and Randall's constant browbeating do peel the layers off Fischer's self-centered shell, and we finally see both men's vulnerability. The relationship is the focal point of the movie, for Fischer brings vitality and enthusiasm, but he needs Randall's sage and seasoned experience. The rest of the movie finds them friends, but both have their mettle tested in a series of events that show them as the best they can be... Both, too, are in need of healing and forgiveness, while they try to forge a final bond with the women they love.As with most adventure movies nowadays, there are able panoramic sea scenes, some of which are reminiscent of 'The Perfect Storm'. The story and the way it weaves through danger, relationships, and training has an emotional undertow that isn't entirely different than 'The Horse Whisperer'. And, though many comparisons can be made to other movies, the sum of 'The Guardian's parts is assembled in a unique way. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher keep the drama afloat with focused performances that create memorable characters. Particularly, Kutcher delivers a genuine performance as a cocky recruit who has great pain and insecurity bubbling below the surface. The dialogue is above most adventure movies with some particularly poignant lines for Costner. 'The Guardian' delivers heroism and inspiration in a film that nearly steered a course into a wreck of sentimentality awash with cliches and stereotypes.",4,Changing of the Guard,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,3688,"['are', 'many', 'dangers', 'being', 'member', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'Taken', 'icy', 'waters', 'Bering', 'Strait', 'coast', 'Kodiak', 'Alaska', 'possibilities', 'danger', 'choppy', 'waves', 'hypothermia', 'broken', 'vessels', 'rocky', 'caves', 'rise', 'exponentially', 'Dreadful', 'decisions', 'meet', 'rescuer', 'opportunity', 'save', 'lives', 'Who', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'saved', 'Who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'lifesaving', 'seminar', 'rescuer', 'must', 'stay', 'alive', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'others', 'Hazardous', 'conditions', 'low', 'pay', 'are', 'part', 'parcel', 'harrowing', 'life', 'heroes', 'factors', 'set', 'up', 'premise', 'promising', 'movie', 'Guardian', 'shows', 'possibilities', 'Ben', 'Randall', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'maverick', 'aging', 'senior', 'chief', 'who', 'still', 'top', 'form', 'beginning', 'find', 'challenged', 'rescue', 'out', 'clock', 'colleagues', 'harm', 'way', 'descending', 'rescue', ""'copter"", 'wave', 'reeling', 'sea', 'where', 'trajectory', 'debacle', 'Randall', 'best', 'friend', 'out', 'sea', 'even', 'best', 'efforts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'Randall', 'recovers', 'haunted', 'memory', 'recent', 'disaster', 'left', 'impotent', 'save', 'others', 'superior', 'reassigns', 'train', 'recruits', 'senior', 'officer', 'wise', 'enough', 'know', 'trauma', 'even', 'best', 'rescuers', 'tentative', 'time', 'can', 'heal', 'inner', 'wounds.At', 'training', 'academy', 'Randall', 'best', 'asset', 'throwing', 'away', 'text', 'book', 'always', 'throwing', 'recruits', 'thick', 'training', 'grueling', 'situations', 'Here', 'smug', 'promising', 'Ivy', 'League', 'recruit', 'Jake', 'Fischer', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'properly', 'nicknamed', 'Goldfish', 'smimming', 'prowess', 'silver', 'spoon', 'sensibilities', 'friction', 'instructor', 'recruit', 'not', 'different', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'especially', ""'An"", 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'bond', 'develop', 'strong', 'very', 'different', 'discover', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'including', 'aptitude', 'break', 'swimming', 'records', 'past', 'protagonist', 'similar', 'fashion', 'Tough', 'Randall', 'strong', 'words', 'quickly', 'silence', 'even', 'most', 'brazen', 'potential', 'crew', 'especially', 'cocky', 'Fischer', 'A', 'series', 'mishaps', 'Randall', 'constant', 'browbeating', 'do', 'peel', 'layers', 'Fischer', 'self-centered', 'shell', 'finally', 'see', 'men', 'vulnerability', 'relationship', 'focal', 'point', 'movie', 'Fischer', 'vitality', 'enthusiasm', 'Randall', 'sage', 'seasoned', 'experience', 'rest', 'movie', 'friends', 'have', 'mettle', 'tested', 'series', 'events', 'show', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'are', 'need', 'healing', 'forgiveness', 'try', 'forge', 'final', 'bond', 'women', 'love.As', 'most', 'adventure', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'are', 'able', 'panoramic', 'sea', 'scenes', 'are', 'reminiscent', ""'The"", 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'story', 'way', 'danger', 'relationships', 'training', 'emotional', 'undertow', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'different', ""'The"", 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'though', 'many', 'comparisons', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'other', 'movies', 'sum', ""'The"", 'Guardian', 'parts', 'assembled', 'unique', 'way', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'keep', 'drama', 'afloat', 'focused', 'performances', 'create', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Particularly', 'Kutcher', 'genuine', 'performance', 'cocky', 'recruit', 'who', 'great', 'pain', 'insecurity', 'bubbling', 'surface', 'dialogue', 'most', 'adventure', 'movies', 'particularly', 'poignant', 'lines', 'Costner', 'Guardian', 'delivers', 'heroism', 'inspiration', 'film', 'nearly', 'steered', 'course', 'wreck', 'sentimentality', 'awash', 'cliches', 'stereotypes']",N/A

1033530,AGG9C66TOLJZB,B000KF0GWW,"A. Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[2, 2]","This is definitely watchable, we bought the DVD and watched it start to finish - it is an exciting subject (Coastguard Swimmers) but that was really the only originality in this movie (I think. The script is absurdly riddled with cliches and heavily referenced to other action and coming of age style movies (An officer and a Gentelman readily springs to mind!) We had to look at the out-takes to make sense of some of the stuff going on in here too.The basic outline of the story is Champion Coastguard Swimmer Randall (Kevin Costner) is losing his marriage and in one dramatic rescue ends up losing his crew and his best friend. He is moved (against his will) to the academy to train other Coastguard swimmers. Happily Costner holds all the previous records, and happens to be there when Fischer (played by Ashton Kutcher) comes along to challenge them. Of course Fischer's name is shortened to Fisch - which he is - I guess there are no champion Coastguard Swimmers called Tarbotham, or Hogg??? - Anyway. There is immediate clash between Randall and the cocky Fisch - who immediately states he is going to break all the previous records. Naturally they continually clash but there is growing respect. Costner has to break Fisch down and teach him to work in a team. Fisch (naturally) proves he is one stoic dude not matter how much pain is thrown at him (HOO RAH! in coastguard speak) And thus Fisch and RAndall grow together to the point they end up in Kodiak together patrolling the Bering sea.The first rescue they perform together nearly ends in disaster when Randall flashes back and needs to be bought back by Fisch. Then they are out on another rescue and Fisch needs to be rescued by Randall - then there is a struggle - the line back to the helicopter is breaking under the strain (don't they have to check their equipment). The ensuing scene reflects a story which has been previously told abont Randall in which a winch jammed while in the middle of the rescue, they couldn't haul Randall and his rescued person into the helicopter so he held him for 20 minutes until the reached land. In that rescue Randall torn all his ligaments and tendons but he 'never let go'. Fisch, who is on the line is holding onto Randall who is trying to fall to give Fisch a change to make it to the helicopter says ""I won't let go' and RAndall replies 'I know'.Without spoiling things, there are two endings available on DVD. The chosen ending which they show is real Boy's Own Stuff - it harks back to A Kind of Man Alone mythology - Shane riding off into the sunset in a WEstern. It really didn't do anything for me, except make me howl with laughter. In the commentary the director talked about why they chose this ending and said it was the more emotionally powerful. So I watched the alternate ending available on DVD and I can see why they made that choice. The Alternate ending definitely lacked any emotional impact - it was jokey and shallow. Frankly I didn't find either ending emotionally satisfying - The chosen one went with some kind of spiritual mumbo-jumbo and the alternate jokey superficiality. Poor Choices as far as I could see.The Coda of the whole thing also Lacked emotional depth and reflected most strongly an Officer and a Gentleman. Can't men, who have sat around for months doing nothing, wait for the end of the working day?So while this was cliched and both endings were flawed, it was a reasonable watch through once, but I wouldn't go there again.The Highlight? The closing credits where they showed old shots of the Coastguard - and good on the coastguard it is not an easy job and boy would I want them coming for me if I was in trouble.",3,"This is enjoyably watchable, once, cliched and lacking in originality",1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,3666,"['definitely', 'watchable', 'bought', 'DVD', 'watched', 'start', 'finish', 'exciting', 'subject', 'Coastguard', 'Swimmers', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'originality', 'movie', 'think', 'script', 'absurdly', 'riddled', 'cliches', 'heavily', 'referenced', 'other', 'action', 'coming', 'age', 'style', 'movies', 'officer', 'Gentelman', 'readily', 'mind', 'had', 'look', 'out-takes', 'make', 'sense', 'stuff', 'going', 'here', 'too.The', 'basic', 'outline', 'story', 'Champion', 'Coastguard', 'Swimmer', 'Randall', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'losing', 'marriage', 'one', 'dramatic', 'rescue', 'up', 'losing', 'crew', 'best', 'friend', 'moved', 'will', 'academy', 'train', 'other', 'Coastguard', 'swimmers', 'Happily', 'Costner', 'previous', 'records', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'Fischer', 'played', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'along', 'challenge', 'course', 'Fischer', 'name', 'shortened', 'Fisch', 'guess', 'are', 'champion', 'Coastguard', 'Swimmers', 'called', 'Tarbotham', 'Hogg', 'Anyway', 'immediate', 'clash', 'Randall', 'cocky', 'Fisch', 'who', 'immediately', 'going', 'break', 'previous', 'records', 'Naturally', 'continually', 'clash', 'growing', 'respect', 'Costner', 'break', 'Fisch', 'down', 'teach', 'work', 'team', 'Fisch', 'naturally', 'one', 'stoic', 'dude', 'not', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'pain', 'thrown', 'HOO', 'RAH', 'coastguard', 'speak', 'thus', 'Fisch', 'RAndall', 'grow', 'together', 'point', 'end', 'up', 'Kodiak', 'together', 'patrolling', 'Bering', 'sea.The', 'first', 'perform', 'together', 'nearly', 'disaster', 'when', 'Randall', 'back', 'be', 'bought', 'back', 'Fisch', 'Then', 'are', 'out', 'rescue', 'Fisch', 'be', 'rescued', 'Randall', 'then', 'struggle', 'line', 'back', 'helicopter', 'breaking', 'strain', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'check', 'equipment', 'ensuing', 'scene', 'story', 'been', 'previously', 'told', 'abont', 'Randall', 'winch', 'jammed', 'middle', 'rescue', 'could', ""n't"", 'haul', 'Randall', 'rescued', 'person', 'helicopter', 'so', 'held', '20', 'minutes', 'reached', 'land', 'rescue', 'Randall', 'ligaments', 'tendons', 'let', 'go', 'Fisch', 'who', 'line', 'holding', 'Randall', 'who', 'trying', 'fall', 'give', 'Fisch', 'change', 'make', 'helicopter', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'RAndall', 'replies', ""know'.Without"", 'spoiling', 'things', 'are', 'two', 'endings', 'available', 'DVD', 'chosen', 'ending', 'show', 'real', 'Boy', 'Own', 'Stuff', 'back', 'A', 'Kind', 'Man', 'Alone', 'mythology', 'Shane', 'riding', 'off', 'sunset', 'WEstern', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'make', 'howl', 'laughter', 'commentary', 'director', 'talked', 'why', 'chose', 'ending', 'said', 'was', 'more', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'So', 'watched', 'alternate', 'ending', 'available', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'made', 'choice', 'Alternate', 'ending', 'definitely', 'lacked', 'emotional', 'impact', 'was', 'jokey', 'shallow', 'Frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'either', 'ending', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'chosen', 'one', 'went', 'kind', 'spiritual', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'alternate', 'jokey', 'superficiality', 'Poor', 'Choices', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'see.The', 'Coda', 'whole', 'thing', 'also', 'Lacked', 'emotional', 'depth', 'reflected', 'most', 'strongly', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'men', 'who', 'have', 'sat', 'months', 'doing', 'nothing', 'wait', 'end', 'working', 'day', 'So', 'was', 'cliched', 'endings', 'were', 'flawed', 'was', 'reasonable', 'watch', 'once', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'again.The', 'Highlight', 'closing', 'credits', 'where', 'showed', 'old', 'shots', 'Coastguard', 'good', 'coastguard', 'not', 'easy', 'job', 'boy', 'would', 'want', 'coming', 'was', 'trouble']",N/A

1033535,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B000KF0GWW,Bill Garrison,"[4, 5]","The Guardian is a 139 minute film starring Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner. Costner plays an aging Coast Guard rescue swimmer who is a sole survivor in a tragic accident at sea that takes the lives of his crew.  Amidst marriage problems, Costner leaves his home in Alaska to teach a group of new recruits at a Coast Guard base in South Carolina (I think that's where it was.)  Kutcher plays one of the new recruits and Kutcher is arrogant, boastful and thinks he can be the best rescue swimmer ever, and even break all of Costner's Coast Guard swimming records.The strength of the movie lies in the training segment which takes up the long middle of the movie.  Coster changes teaching methods which causes tension among some of the instructors, including the excellent Neal McDonough.  While movies about training people to become soldiers are quite common, this movie is unique.  The movie is a must see if only to learn about the Coast Guard and the peril that often face the rescue swimmers.  I know I could never run for miles with a heavy back pack on my back like marines do, but if I failed, I wouldn't die.  The Coast Guard rescue swimmers where intense training in icy water could lead to hypothermia or drowning.The subplots drag the movie down.  Costner is fighting to save his marriage and this storyline felt like it belonged, but the one with Kutcher and the school teacher felt forced and unnecessary.In conclusion, I recommend this movie if only for the knowledge  you'll receive about the Coast Guard rescue swimmers.  The cast is solid and the action is top notch.

There is the obligatory training footage, which lasts way too long.  Some other stuff happens, which was boring enough I can't remember what it was.  Then Kutcher has a big reveal of his Big Secret, and I literally laughed out loud - not because of his performance (which is not too great even in his big scene) but because of the truly inept prop that the movie puts in front of us to help with the Exposition of the Big Secret.Slow, boring and tedious - not what you expect from an action movie about arctic rescue swimmers.

There he runs into the cocky Jake Fischer who is clearly a superior swimmer but has an attitude.  Randall is already a legend as a Coast Guard rescue swimmer, and Fischer thinks he already is one without having done anything, which sets up some interesting interactions.  There are other things about Fischer we learn along the way that really make the character rather interesting.The Guardian borrows heavily from An Officer and a Gentlemen and other movies of this ilk like Men of Honor.  But it's also different enough to keep the viewer's interest.  The character development of Randall and Fischer is very well done - especially Fischer as we see him mature before our eyes throughout movie.

Kevin Costner, Sela Ward and Ashton Kutcher give solid performances. And Bonnie Bramlett is a breath of fresh air with her scene stealing performance. This movie works on all levels because it has bravado as well as romance, the always fun to watch competition between the young and old lions and some touching life lesson scenes that make you proud of your age. More than most leading men, Costner opts for older women (the still beautiful Sela Ward) as his co-star; which, (to me at least) gives his movies a classy taste of reality.

1033555,A2Z44AN3F2IN61,B000KF0GWW,D. K. Stokes,"[3, 3]","The Guardian wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either. It was pretty much a standard military movie, on the order of, say, Top Gun, or a dozen others. Every bit of plot was predictable, from the best friend dying at the beginning, to the cocky kid the instructor is extra tough on because he reminds him of himself, to the romance, right down to the ending.Kevin Costner plays a Coast Guard rescue swimmer whose wife left him, and his best friend died in a rescue gone bad, and when he gets out of the hospital, he's sent to the school to train rescue swimmers. Ashton Kutcher is the cocky kid.The beginning, with the wife leaving, sparked one of my rants--it was never explained, beyond a general ""he was married to his job"", and since they'd obviously been together a long time, there really needed to be a precipitating factor. I could believe there had been one, but not being privy to it, I couldn't feel sympathy for either of them. It reminded me of the Tom Clancy books with the inexplicable wives. Because women, you know, don't really have reasons for the stuff they do. (told you I ranted--be grateful I already got it mostly out of my system)The other part that really bugged me was the romance Ashton Kutcher's character had with a local school teacher. There was zero chemistry between the characters. In short, I didn't believe either relationship thread, and they seemed tacked on to fill in a checklist. It was a long movie--136 minutes--so I wouldn't have missed it if they'd just cut those parts out entirely.The rescue scenes and the training scenes, and the Coast Guard itself, were the real stars of the movie. The Coast Guard is really underrepresented in movies, and it was nice to get a picture of them.Quibble: why, why, why, does every single movie with a disaster at sea have the scene with characters in a room slowly filling with water, and the water always gets almost to the ceiling before they're rescued? It always happens. And in The Guardian, it went on far too long. There's a point in an action scene where tension turns to boredom. This scene passed that point.As for the acting, I like Kevin Costner, generally, and he was fine in this movie. I've no complaints. Ashton Kutcher was fine in the action/adventure scenes, but in the romance scenes, he had the same emotional depth as in the classroom scenes. It was like Tom Cruise in Top Gun, but without the charm.Secondary characters: I did enjoy the bartender (played by Bonnie Bramlett)--she wasn't a stock character, and had a lot of the funny &/or insightful lines in the film. I also liked the other instructor (played by Neal McDonough), mostly because he surprised me. I expected the usual rival, but instead, he behaved the way I'd expect the character to in real life.Bottom line: if you like this kind of movie, you'll enjoy The Guardian.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[2, 2]","As others have doubtlessly pointed out, there are some genuine parallels between the present movie and the 1980sTop Gun (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition).  Like TG, it is about a grizzled veteran (portrayed by Kevin Costner) who is attempting to teach a young hot-shot (Ashton Kutcher) (in TG it was Tom Skeritt & Tom Cruise in these roles).  There is the ubiquitous babe-in-the-bar-bet (this time played by Melissa Sagemiller;  Kelly McGillis in TG).  And, of course, there are the haunting flashbacks to a disaster.That said, anyone who wishes to write this movie off as nothing more than the Coast Guard's version of TOP GUN would be sorely mistaken.  This is a great movie in its own right, and the comparisons to the landmark Navy aviation flick should only be peripheral.  In short, this is a terrific story that both intrigues the viewer as well as demonstrates the awe inspiring professionalism of the United States Coast Guard.Unlike TG, this is a movie that's much more about the instructor (Costner) than it is the student.  Afraid that he is on the verge of being washed up, a legendary Senior Chief takes a temporary assignment to teach a new generation of rescue swimmers.  Among them is a Michael Phelps like swimmer (Kutcher) who has all the physical tools but needs to be shown the ropes of the craft.Having watchedDeadliest Catch - Seasons 1, 2, & 3on the HISTORY Channel, I could tell that there was a remarkable degree of authenticity to the procedures / terminology / operations of the Coast Guard as they were depicted in this film.  The end credits showed what I had suspected, which was that there was a great deal of collaboration with the Coast Guard during the making of this film.  Some real-live USCG swimmers were even extras in the film!The motto of the Coast Guard is ""So others may live.""  This is precisely the same motto used by the brave Air Force parajumpers who go behind enemy lines to rescue downed pilots.  This is a truly fabulous movie that is family friendly and pays homage to the gallant sailors, airmen & swimmers who are in the Coast Guard & uphold this motto as a sacred trust.

Although I don't know that much about the CG, I'm sure this movie has been ""Hollywoodized"" like most other movies about the military.  Regardless, it was a good story with mostly believable characters.  Costner's Senior Chief Randall is believable except when he's jumping out of a helicopter.  Of all the rescue swimmers I've come across, not one of them appeared to be over 30.  It is definitely a game for the young.  There aren't that many CG Senior Chiefs, and someone like Randall might be in charge of a training unit or even a small CG station, but probably not jumping out of a helo on a dark and stormy night.  That aside, the part that REALLY bugged me was the clich&eacute;d inter-service bar fight.  I spent nearly 24 years in the Navy, and I never saw ANY overt hostility towards ANY member of ANY other service.  Also, Navy people, officer or enlisted, don't typically go to civilian bars in uniform.  A Navy Captain as fat, old, and decrepit looking as the one in the bar scene is the very rare exception.  I'm sure that 30 or 40 years ago you could find a Navy Chief fighting in a bar, but today, it would be very unusual.  Today, a Navy Chief behaving like the knuckle-draggers depicted in the movie probably wouldn't be a Chief for very long.  That fat old Captain would also likely find himself in a fix for allowing enlisted sailors to behave like that.

The photography and superimposed action shots of rescues in the midst of nature's havoc are stunning to watch.The movie itself is well made by director Andrew Davis (Collateral Damage, The Fugitive, Under Siege, etc) and the actors selected to portray the one-dimensional roles as written by Ron L. Brinkerhoff carry the movie along.  The problem, if it is one for the viewer, is that this story has been told so many times for every branch of the service industries (Navy, Marines, Army, Firefighters, Policemen) and now adds the US Coast Guard to the mix.  The synopsis in a capsule is old tortured USCG rescue swimmer (Kevin Kostner) is a dedicated man who puts his job before his wife (Sela Ward) and loses his rescue swimmer's team in a disaster, placing him in nightmare torn state that the USCG recognizes and sends him off to be an instructor for the USCG where he encounters a brilliant young athlete recruit (Ashton Kutcher) with his own similar demons and the two work things out to the betterment of both.It is not a bad story, just a tired one.  But as a movie it carries fairly well thanks to the scenes with the Sea - beautifully captured by cinematographer Stephen St. John  with a lot of help from special effects chief Scott Fisher and visual effects chief Erika Abrams.

1033578,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B000KF0GWW,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[3, 3]","Part Backdraft, part Top Gun and part Officer And A Gentlemen, The Guardian shamelessly borrows from other movies of similar genres but still manages to be entertaining.  It's intentions are nothing but good and it's delivery is solid if not predictable.In it's defense, The Guardian weaves an entertaining tale of a young hot shot Coast Guard candidate who enrolls in the AST (Advanced Swim Training) division of the armed service.  This is the course that determines if you have what it takes to be a Rescue Swimmer, the `Iron-men/women' who jump out of the helicopter to pull people out of the rough seas.  The attrition rate is 50%, so we know we will see people drop like flies.  Enter Ben Randall (Kevin Costner), an aging but still highly effective and decorated Rescue swimmer who wants nothing to do with a desk job.  But his stubbornness is destroying his marriage, and his body.  After an unavoidable tragedy, he is ordered to teach a class at the Kodiak AST Training academy.  Here Ben encounters Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher), a young aggressive candidate who states he there `to exceed his every expectation'.  Randall likes to call him `Goldfish' (equal to Maverick, Mayo and Probie in the movies mentioned above).  As the movie goes on we get some of the same stuff; Fischer is more focused on himself and not the group.  He has motives that are unclear.  But the resolutions are not completely predictable.  There is no hard headedness about Fisher, he's willing to do whatever Randall tells him to pass the class.  In the process, we are treated to seeing Randall's unorthodox training methods; surviving in a huge tube of ice water.  Treading water for a straight hour with no fins.  Making Jake break all the speed records to show that no one cares if he does.The one love story sub-plot is totally predictable; Fischer falls for a local girl (Melissa Sagemiller) who wears her heart on her sleeve saying, `In 18 weeks there will be another crop of you guys coming through here...', hmm, sounds familiar.  The love story between Randall and his wife (Sela Ward) is there to invoke many tears in female viewers.  This isn't to say that these sub plots aren't necessary, they have value.  And maybe their predictability lies in the fact that they happen in real life.  I'm sure we can all think of people we know who's work has affected their marriage or met someone while in training.  I would think so.  So they add some heart and soul to the movie.The performances are all solid.  Costner is slowly working his way back from Waterworld hell (took long enough) and re-building his resume with good performances in good (not great) movies.  Will he ever get to `No Way Out/Bull Durham/Field of Dreams' status?  Who knows.  But he seems happy making his recent films and no one can judge him for that.  Kutcher has some serious shiny moments in this movie.  He shows potential for great stardom and depending on his next few projects, he could get there.  His efforts in this movie are impressive (he actually got in shape to pass all the physical requirements and swimming speeds to be a Rescue Swimmer), and actually shows depth and convincing change in his character as the movie moves on.All in all, the movie stands up to and pays tribute to those who live by the code of `So others may live'.

'The Guardian,' although littered with clich&eacute;s, is a very moving. The premise is a veteran United States Coast Guard rescue diver named Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) is sent to oversee the training of prospective divers at an elite school known as ""A"" School. Randall, who is still recovering from losing his crew in a failed rescue mission, makes sure the trainees understand the intensity of the life they are ready to embark upon. His unconventional methods are criticized by fellow coast guard personnel, but his experience is ultimately respected. Randall focuses on one trainee in particular, named Jake Fischer (Kutcher). Fischer's cockiness does not create a great first impression on Randall, but throughout the film their relationship undergoes a great change.What really impressed me in this film was its representation of the USCG. There are very few films that highlight the actions of these brave men and women, and if nothing else, 'The Guardian' is an awe-inspiring tribute to the most overlooked branch of the United States armed forces. At times watching the swimmers endure in-the-water torture is very uncomfortable but effective. There are plenty of adrenaline-charged scenes, most of which involve either Coast Guard rescue swimmer training or actual missions. This story gripped my heart. It gave me a better understanding of the Coast Guard in a way that I would never experience except by first hand.I also found the characters just as appealing as the subject matter. Not only does Costner portray reluctant Coast Guard instructor Ben Randall with humor and sincerity, but his ""average Joe, aw shucks"" demeanor is reminiscent of Crash Davis in Bull Durham.  Ashton Kutcher does a fine job as the full-of-himself Jake Fischer, a fast swimmer with a faster mouth, which often gets him into trouble. He was perfect as the 'son' model and didn't upstage or take anything away from the lead role with his performance,  The cast is rounded out by veterans John Heard and Kurgan himself Clancy Brown as various Coast Guard personnel.'The Guardian' is a powerful piece of cinematic history that will forever be remembered for its tribute to the heroism of the men and women of the USCG, as well as the dangers they must endure on a daily basis. Yes, it is very predictable and yes we have seen most of it before, but this film stands on its own in a climate of rehashed cheap entertainment that Hollywood has been rabidly feeding audiences.

I enjoy movies were the good guys are men of integrity and honor, even if they swill some beer and start the occasional fight.

I connected with the idea that Costner is torn between his passion for being in the water making a difference and really being there for his wife.I personally do not like Aston Kutcher as an actor. He always came off goofy in the roles I watched him in, except this one. I understood his desire to be number one, to set records, and I also found myself searching for more. Kutcher does an adequate job in this role learning from the salty Chief.The director does a fine job with the story getting you involved emotionally without becoming bored and keeping the action real without going over the top or to CG.

1033587,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000KF0GWW,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[4, 4]","Let me start off by saying that when I first saw the previews for this film I had mixed feelings about whether I wanted to see it. A part of me really wanted to see the movie because it looked good (although I had a sneaking suspicion that I knew how it might end, but that wouldn't ruin the movie for me necessarily), but another part of me was unsure of the film for two reasons and both reasons deal with the two lead actors. Reason one, Ashton Kutcher (""Butterfly Effect"" and MTV's ""Punk'd""), I personally don't think too much of Ashton's movies, ""Butterfly Effect"" was cool, but his other efforts I didn't care a whole lot about or even want to see. The 'why' of my not liking Ashton's films probably has a lot to do with his show on MTV, and from that I find it increasingly difficult to take him even remotely serious as an actor and therefore I found it hard to believe he could be that good in this film. My second reason is Kevin Costner, at one time he was an excellent actor who churned out hit after hit, but sometime around the release of ""Waterworld"" he apparently lost his good judgment for movie roles. Which resulted in some rather lackluster movies from the actor. So, with his track record being less than stellar of late, I was unsure about whether this would be another one of those box office stinkers of his, and the fact that Kutcher was the co-lead in the film lended this theory more credibility. However, two beacons of hope gave me reason to think this movie may just be alright after all, the first was Ashton's strong performance in ""Butterfly Effect"" which surprised me, and the second was Kevin Costner's 2003 film ""Open Range"" which I felt was some of the best work he'd done since ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"". With those two thoughts in mind, and the fact that after its release many people told me that it was a good movie, and one I should see (the critics disagreed with most general audiences on this point, most critics didn't think much of the movie), I actually got excited to see the movie, and so I decided to sit down and see if it really was as good as people, whose opinions I agree with, thought, or if the critics were right that this movie couldn't tread water.""The Guardian"" is the story of ace Coast Guard swimmer/rescuer Ben Randall (Kevin Costner), who is one of the United States Coast Guard's best; however, after a recent rescue operation goes horribly awry, Randall is left reeling from his grief. To help him cope, his commanding officer (Clancy Brown) sends him to a Coast Guard training center so that he may train new, raw recruits how to be the best rescuers they can be. While there Randall's patience is sorely tested by an up-and-coming hot shot Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher), whose arrogance and focus on being the best in his class is merely hiding a deep tragedy in his past that he is hoping desperately to forget. Though polar opposites, these two men may just find they have more in common than just their desire to save lives, and in the process they may just help each other cope with their deep pain, and become even greater heroes so that others may live.So, I suppose you're wondering what my thoughts were on this movie, obviously based on my rating of it being a 4 out of 5, then I must've enjoyed it. Well, truth be told, I did enjoy it. Yes, the movie is fairly predictable (just as I suspected), but on the flip side the movie was also really enjoyable. Both leading stars, Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner, gave great depth and realism to their respective roles. Both character arcs were fairly easy to see how they would go, but there were a couple of twists that I didn't see, I mean I knew that Kutcher's character obviously had some tragedy in his past, but I was surprised as to what it turned out to be. And the scene where Kutcher reveals his past to Costner is very well-acted, especially on the part of Kutcher, who brought a surpising vulnerability to his role at that point that I never thought him capable of.The story for ""The Guardian"" was very formulaic, but never boring. A big part of this movie's success goes to the skilled eye of director Andrew Davis (""The Fugitive"") who took a basic, by-the-book action movie in the vein of ""Top Gun"", and made it an inspirational homage to the brave men and women that risk their lives in the U.S. Coast Guard. Where this movie truly shines is in the breathtakingly realistice rescue sequences that were done with input from the Coast Guard to ensure a realistic tone and feel. By seamlessly blending CGI and footage shot inside a 750,000 water tank, these sequences are a testament to what these brave men and women in the Coast Guard must go through on a daily basis when they are sent to rescue someone.The only complaint I have with this movie, also lies in the predictability of the movie. There were numerous plot points in this movie that have occured time and time again in movies that are quite similar, though I won't list them here because it could ruin some of the story for those that may not have seen it yet. Aside from the rescue sequences there really was no new ground being broken here, but that's not really a bad thing for the genre, because why fix something that's not broke. However, the predictability of a scene near the end is the chief reason that I couldn't give the movie a 5 out of 5, I won't say what exactly happens, but anyone that's seen the movie probably knows exactly what I'm talking about. The movie would have been so much better if the writer had opted not to use this over used, easy-to-see coming plot device that numerous movies of this genre include in their films in an attempt to lend gravity to the entire movie. A move that was hardly necessary in this film, and would have been much better if left out.That complaint aside, the movie is a solid action film, that is meant as a very heartfelt homage to the brave members of the United States Coast Guard who risk their lives everyday so that others may live.""The Guardian"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",4,So That Others May Live...,1185062400,"07

1033588,A3FMHVIRX7X6TS,B000KF0GWW,"Kara D. Lane ""Author, Wake Up to Powerful Living""","[2, 2]","I loved this movie!  I bought it mainly because Kevin Costner was in it, and he tends to star in good films.  Since I only knew Ashton Kutcher from ""That 70's Show"" and his connection to Demi Moore, I wasn't sure what to expect from him.  Both Costner and Kutcher played their parts tremendously and had great on-screen chemistry.This is a story about the U.S. Coast Guard rescue swimmers.  Costner plays Ben, a celebrated rescue swimmer who has saved hundreds of lives, but who has recently experienced a great tragedy during a rescue, not to mention the fact that his wife is leaving him.He is temporarily asked to train potential rescue swimmers to give him a break from rescuing.  There, he meets Jake (played by Kutcher), a cocky swim champion who's out to break all the records Ben set when he was going through his training.Ben rides Jake hard, because he thinks he's just interested in the U.S. Coast Guard training to break records, not to save lives.  As the story progresses, he finds out a secret from Jake's past that puts things into perspective, and the two men form a strong friendship.In addition to being a very moving story, there's a lot of humor in the film.  At one point, Jake is sitting in a bar complaining to his girlfriend that he'd had a bad day because Ben had been riding him and said he thought he was just jealous because he broke his records.  The bartender then holds up an article she'd framed about an amazing, selfless rescue Ben had made and she tells Jake that until he can break that record, he basically has nothing to brag about.  To which, Jake turns to his girlfriend and says, ""My day wasn't that bad.""  Subtle humor.This is a really good movie, that holds your attention throughout.  And the ending blew me away.  It was definitely not what I was expecting.  I was still in shock as they rolled through the credits at the end.

When you think of ashton kucher in acting roles you think dumbass college boy right? Well in this movie he is completely opposite from that and very serious. He did a very good job in his role as Jake Fischer. But let me start from the beginning.The guardian is a movie about the coast guard and in particular rescue swimmers. It's about a bunch of recruits who are going through training to be rescue swimmers. The coast guard only takes a handful and only the best. Jake Fischer (ashton kutcher) is the main recruit, one of the most gifted, and by far the best of them all. He also is a little cocky to go with it. He and his fellow recruits get instructed by a legend. Senior Chief Ben Randall, who is played by Kevin Costner, is a guy who after dealing with a horrible accident is forced to go instruct recruits as a comeback before he can go back in the water. That doesn't make him to happy. The whole time he and Fischer deal with their own issues and their  personalities clash. In the end it's all for one thing though. To try to become a rescue swimmer for the coast guard which  is one of the most difficult and dangerous jobs in the world.I must say I am a guy who likes military and war movies and I didn't know much about the coast guard before this movie.  But I'm here to say that after watching this I was left with a feeling of much respect for all of the coast guard. A branch of  the military that is often forgotten and disrespected. But just as they say in the movie, "" No one likes us until they need  us."" Anyone who has been disrespected unfairly can understand that it doesnt make sense.People should also remember  they were a huge part of the support that was given during Hurricane Katrina. Like I said before kutcher gives a great  performance. A great indication that this guy can do some serious movies. Also the rest of the cast was great as well  especially Kevin Costner. Seeing how much work everyone put in preparing for this movie it's just well done all around.  Great emotion and feeling in this movie.

1033600,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B000KF0GWW,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[2, 2]","This is an &#34;old style&#34; adventure/action film about men serving in US Coast Guard - quite watchable, although not exactly a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) is the top rescue swimmer at the United States Coast Guard's Aviation Survival Technician (AST) program. A veteran married to his job, currently assigned mostly to training of new recruits, he is a kind of legend amongst his pairs. Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) is an arrogant, hot-shot candidate for AST, who was ranked as a top competitive swimmer in high school - and Randall takes an immediate dislike to him. Fischer got scholarships to every Ivy league college, but he opted to enlist in the Coast Guard instead - something which Randall, who can't stand him, finds suspicious. The match of Fisher's defiant arrogance vs. Randall's relentless cold hostility will make this whole training season a highly interesting and stressful thing, as feathers start to fly almost immediately... I will say no more about the story.This is actually a quite good film, which reminded me a little movies made in 40s and 50s about different armed services of US military. It is a quite masculine film, with women being relegated to second roles of hot girlfriend (Melissa Sagemiller) or (soon to be ex) wife (Sela Ward) - which makes sense as the world of elite swimmer rescuers is still a very male dominated place... The difficult relationship between a grizzled grouchy veteran and an overconfident, arrogant but not entirely devoided of talent young apprentice is a kind of clich&eacute; in the movies - but here it somehow works. I always kind of liked Ashton Kutcher ever since he impressed me in &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34; and he certainly doesn't disappoint in this one - I also always kind of DISLIKED Kevin Costner (and still mostly do), but I found him particularly good in this film.Scenes of rescue at sea are quite good and the whole training program is very well shown indeed and in fact many of the supporting actors, including ASTC instructors, helicopter pilot, and support personnel were actual U.S. Coast Guard service members. Granted, the general tone of the film sounds a little bit like a commercial for US Coast Guard - but honestly, after seeing what those guys are doing to save people, I don't really see it as a problem.The ending is honest - not very good, but better than many other Hollywood endings.Bottom line, this is a very honest adventure/action movie, which I actually liked more than I expected as - let's state it once again - I am NOT a big fan of Kevin Costner.

1033606,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000KF0GWW,Mark Baker,"[19, 21]","Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) is a rarity in the Coast Guard.  Even though he's over 40, he's still in the field serving as a rescue swimmer.  Whenever the sea near his base in Kodiak, Alaska gets rough, he's the one who jumps out of the helicopter and rescues those who have fallen overboard.  And he's one of the best at what he does, with an impressive record or saves against overwhelming odds.He's hit a rough patch, however.  His wife (Sela Ward) has left him and his entire crew was killed in an accident while they were trying to rescue the survivor of a shipwreck.  In a move to help him recover emotionally, he's temporarily reassigned to ""A"" School, where the Coast Guard trains rescue swimmers.And that's why Ben is on hand when Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) enters the program.  He's a high school swimming star who has turned down Ivy League scholarships to become a rescue swimmer.  On the first day, he brags that he will beat all of Randall's old records.Obviously, Jake has a problem with arrogance.  Ben doesn't give him a break but spends all his time picking on his star student.  Will Jake stand up to the pressure?Given the previews and the plot of this movie, I'm sure it will surprise very few people when I describe it as formulaic.  There were a couple surprises along the way, but for the most part, things unfolded exactly as I expected then to.So, for a movie like this to succeed, it must rely on characters and actors.  Here, the movie hits a home run.  Both Ben and Jake are deeply flawed men who are struggling to maintain or regain their pride.  Even Jake, who comes across as arrogant much of the time, has a truly compassionate side that surfaces as well.  And Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher are excellent in their rolls.  They balance the emotional and comedic scenes expertly.  The movie focuses on these two characters, and the rest of them are underdeveloped as a result, but that's a minor complaint.The movie is over two hours, but I was engrossed the entire time.  The beginning and climax features some truly angry seas, and those special effects were awesome.Even though the plot isn't the most original out there, the movie is still very entertaining and well worth seeing.

During the training sequence when Costner's character was squirting Kutcher with water , I thought at any moment he would utter the words ""Don't you do it! I got nowhere else to go!"" During the bar scene when the boys were betting to see if Kutcher could ""seal the deal"" with the young lady at the bar I thought I was going to hear the tune ""Take my breath away"" playing in the back ground. These were just two of many similarities this film had with ""Top Gun"" and ""An Officer and a Gentlemen"". Truth be told, the Coast Guard action and Costner's personal battles in this movie were very interesting. It could have been a much better film if they removed Kutcher's love interest from the story. I have no problem with the boy meets girl clich&eacute;, but it was really unnecessary in this film. There was no chemistry between Kutcher and his ""gal pal"" and it did little to move the story along, so what's the point? This romance removed would have trimmed the film by at least a half an hour and made this a much better movie. I'm glad that in the final scene when Kutcher came to see his girl at her job he didn't pick her up in his arms and ""take her away from it all"" (ala ""Officer"").

There, he meets Ashton Kuchter.  Kuchter plays the young cocky upstart who learns valuable life and work lessons from the veteran.  All routine stuff..?  Absolutely, and yo can be forgiven at times for thinking you are watching a remake of Top Gun... but it has  a sense of real conviction - and in picking coastguards for a subject we have all the clich&eacute;s of military-like-training, without the negative connotations - only thoroughly decent heroes out to save lives.  After a lengthy training period, the movie finishes with Kuchter's start working in Kodiak, Alaska with Costner's character.  Kuchter has definitely developed some acting chops and fits well, with Costner being the glue that holds the movie together.  It ends up being a tad too long, but all the ingredients are seasoned enough that it's worth the wait to get through to the end.Extras include a few deleted scenes of interest, an alternative ending which was rightfully dropped, and two slight press kit add ons - one about the making of the movie and one about the coastguards. Just the right amount to cover the movie.Emotions are successfully wrung by director, music composer and production designer, and Costner and Kuchter are on top form.

There, he meets Jake Fischer (Kutcher), a swim star who is determined to break all of Randall's previous records.

Costner has just lost his best friend on a mission, and is being forced into the position of teacher for some down time.  He is also dealing with his wife leaving him.

A president can order his Air Force to bomb a nation, killing thousands of innocent people, and not lose sleep over it, while another person will go to great length to save a stranger at the peril of losing his own life.The movie takes you inside the life of the elite Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers. These heroes, who are paid low wages (and therefore are not doing this job for the money), are ready to put their life at risk to rescue people at sea during storms. Would you venture in a helicopter in the middle of a hurricane, then jump into freezing water or a burning ship in order to save a stranger? In fact, the Coast Guard flies when all other pilots, including military, remain on the ground. No mission is impossible, and everyone is given a chance at a rescue attempt, even though many missions fail and Coast Guard rescuers die.The movie will trace how volunteer rescue swimmers are trained (which is really tough), up to real-life missions. There is action in this movie, and it is entertaining, with a great subject matter. However, I did find some weaknesses in it, and felt it could have been done much better. I did not like the ending.In case some of you are wondering about the title, there is a legend that a Guardian lives deep in the sea, and saves drowning people. Many people on the verge of drowning have reported hearing the voice of a man urging them to fight for their life, and thus gain strength, while others have actually reported being pulled out of the deep to the surface by an invisible hand, while hearing encouraging words. According to this movie, the Guardians of the sea are the spirits of the Coast Guard rescuers who died during rescue attempts. Even in death they have as a mission to save lives!

Pidgeon,"[3, 8]","In ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", Richard Gere went flight school and clashed with drill sergeant Louis Gossett, Jr. He fell in love with the local girl Debra Winger, who he met at local military bar, lost his best friend, proved his manhood and gained mutual respect with Gossett in a boxing match, and ended the story happily ever after, graduating from the Academy, sweeping the girl off her feet, and letting love lift him up where he belongs. Tom Cruise did the whole pilot thing again in ""Top Gun"", meeting the pretty girl at the bar, clashing with almost everyone in the Academy, losing his best friend (poor Goose), and took Richard Gere one better in showing off his manhood by actually flying in a real fighter mission. This past year, it was pretty-boy Ashton Kutcher's turn to be the tough military recruit who clashes with his instructor in ""The Guardian"".The first two thirds of ""The Guardian"" are pleasantly enjoyable. Kevin Costner is the aging star Coast Guard rescue diver. When (cue drama police) a rescue mission fails, and his whole team dies, Costner goes into an anguish that gets worsened by his wife's decision to leave him and the Coast Guard commander's decision to reassign him to train the new recruits.The top recruit is star swimmer Ashton Kutcher, who plans on breaking all of Costner's records. Why is an All-American swimmer with scholarship offers to Ivy League schools trying out for the Coast Guard rescue team? You'll find out halfway through in one of those emotional scenes. Why, Ashton wonders, is a great diver like Costner assigned to the menial task of training new recruits? Don't worry, Ashton will find out in one of those male bonding moments.Ashton meets a girl at (yup) the local Coast Guard dive bar. A crisis comes in the boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, Ashton clashes with Costner but eventually bonds, Costner goes back to regular rescue diving, and Ashton graduates. He and the girl agree they had a fling not meant to be. So far we have a decent movie, and this would be a nice, realistic ending.Did the movie end or did it get the Hollywood treatment? What do you think?I'll offer hints at the rest of the film through a series of questions. Did Ashton get assigned to Costner's diving team? Do they go on a rescue mission together? Does Costner see that Ashton is a great rescue diver, and grudgingly admire him? Does Costner realize that he doesn't quite have it any more and decide to retire?Don't stop yet. It gets better. Does Ashton get sent on a very dangerous mission that requires more divers to come in and rescue him? Does Costner, though retired, randomly happen to be in Coast Guard headquarters to hear about the crisis? Does the Coast Guard commander, realizing he needs one more diver to join the rescue team, ask Costner to come along? Does Costner say yes? If he said yes, do he and Ashton end up as the last two people being pulled up by the metal extension chord on the helicopter? Is their combined weight too great to keep it from breaking? Does Costner let go and fall to the sea, allowing Ashton to live? Does Ashton show up at the girl's classroom (she's a teacher), tell her he wants more than a fling, and kiss her before the credits and the uplifting song come on?We've all seen this movie before. It goes by many different names, whether we call it An Officer and a Gentleman, Top Gun, Annapolis, or The Guardian. It's more enjoyable to watch with your buddies, so you can laugh at the final scenes, than with a girl, who will probably call you insensitive while she is bawling her eyes out.",3,Officer and a Gentleman and Top Gun Reincarnated,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,3579,"['Officer', 'Gentleman', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'went', 'flight', 'school', 'clashed', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr', 'fell', 'love', 'local', 'girl', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'who', 'met', 'local', 'military', 'bar', 'lost', 'best', 'friend', 'proved', 'manhood', 'gained', 'mutual', 'respect', 'Gossett', 'boxing', 'match', 'ended', 'story', 'happily', 'ever', 'graduating', 'Academy', 'sweeping', 'girl', 'feet', 'letting', 'love', 'lift', 'up', 'where', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'did', 'whole', 'pilot', 'thing', 'again', 'Top', 'Gun', 'meeting', 'pretty', 'girl', 'bar', 'clashing', 'almost', 'everyone', 'Academy', 'losing', 'best', 'friend', 'poor', 'Goose', 'took', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'one', 'better', 'showing', 'off', 'manhood', 'actually', 'flying', 'real', 'fighter', 'mission', 'past', 'year', 'was', 'pretty-boy', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'turn', 'be', 'tough', 'military', 'recruit', 'who', 'instructor', 'Guardian', '.The', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'Guardian', 'are', 'pleasantly', 'enjoyable', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'aging', 'star', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'rescue', 'diver', 'When', 'cue', 'drama', 'police', 'rescue', 'mission', 'whole', 'team', 'dies', 'Costner', 'anguish', 'worsened', 'wife', 'decision', 'leave', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'commander', 'decision', 'reassign', 'train', 'new', 'recruits.The', 'top', 'recruit', 'star', 'swimmer', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'who', 'breaking', 'Costner', 'records', 'Why', 'All-American', 'swimmer', 'scholarship', 'offers', 'Ivy', 'League', 'schools', 'trying', 'out', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'rescue', 'team', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'halfway', 'one', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'Why', 'Ashton', 'wonders', 'great', 'diver', 'Costner', 'assigned', 'menial', 'task', 'training', 'new', 'recruits', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Ashton', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'male', 'bonding', 'moments.Ashton', 'girl', 'yup', 'local', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'dive', 'bar', 'crisis', 'boyfriend-girlfriend', 'relationship', 'Ashton', 'Costner', 'eventually', 'bonds', 'Costner', 'back', 'regular', 'rescue', 'diving', 'Ashton', 'graduates', 'girl', 'agree', 'had', 'fling', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'So', 'far', 'have', 'decent', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'realistic', 'ending.Did', 'movie', 'end', 'did', 'get', 'Hollywood', 'treatment', 'What', 'do', 'think', ""'ll"", 'offer', 'hints', 'rest', 'film', 'series', 'questions', 'Did', 'Ashton', 'get', 'assigned', 'Costner', 'diving', 'team', 'Do', 'go', 'rescue', 'mission', 'together', 'Does', 'Costner', 'see', 'Ashton', 'great', 'rescue', 'diver', 'grudgingly', 'admire', 'Does', 'Costner', 'realize', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'more', 'decide', 'retire', 'Do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'yet', 'better', 'Does', 'Ashton', 'get', 'sent', 'very', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'more', 'divers', 'come', 'rescue', 'Does', 'Costner', 'though', 'retired', 'randomly', 'happen', 'be', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'headquarters', 'hear', 'crisis', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'commander', 'realizing', 'one', 'more', 'diver', 'join', 'rescue', 'team', 'ask', 'Costner', 'come', 'along', 'Does', 'Costner', 'say', 'yes', 'said', 'yes', 'do', 'Ashton', 'end', 'up', 'last', 'two', 'people', 'being', 'pulled', 'up', 'metal', 'extension', 'chord', 'helicopter', 'combined', 'weight', 'too', 'great', 'keep', 'breaking', 'Does', 'Costner', 'let', 'go', 'fall', 'sea', 'allowing', 'Ashton', 'live', 'Does', 'Ashton', 'show', 'up', 'girl', 'classroom', 'teacher', 'tell', 'more', 'fling', 'kiss', 'credits', 'uplifting', 'song', 'come', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'many', 'different', 'names', 'call', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Annapolis', 'Guardian', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'buddies', 'can', 'laugh', 'final', 'scenes', 'girl', 'who', 'will', 'probably', 'call', 'insensitive', 'bawling', 'eyes', 'out']",N/A

The Guardian is Andrew Davis' (1993's The Fugitive) much lighter look at what recruits in the Coast Guard who apply to be Rescue Swimmers might go through while attempting to pass the Rescue Swimmer test.It's also the story of an instructor (Kevin Costner) that was the best Rescue Swimmer in the business, but reluctantly accepted a teaching job at the Coast Guard Academy.The movie is way more training than I'd have preferred. But there's a good story. There's suspense. And importantly it's fairly believable. The Guardian kind of falls apart towards the end with a sadly predictable ending.One thing that The Guardian does for sure is show you that the Coast Guard is highly underrated. A memorable quote from the movie that puts it in perspective: ""When hurricanes ground the United States Navy, we go out."" Make no mistake that when I suggested earlier that this film is lighter than Kubrick's I did not mean to suggest that Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are any less brave or tough as Marines. You may also walk away from The Guardian with the same notion.My issue with the film is that there wasn't a lot of 'going out' unless you apply the little phrase to Jake (Ashton Kutcher) and Emily's (Melissa Sagemiller) dating. There was a little too much love story. Not enough buddy-film. And mostly training camp. I think a more action-oriented movie might have generated another star.But overall The Guardian was an enjoyable movie.SpongeBob Squarepants' Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) even makes an appearance in this tale of The Sea.

1033642,AKP40TIE5SVSQ,B000KF0GWW,Some Gravity,"[3, 3]","Over the years,with all of the sources of rescue that America has had,one of the most remarkable and reliable sources of rescue has proven itself to be,by far,the United States Coast Guard. If it was not for the United States Coast Guard,America would not be as fortunate as we are to receive all of the help that we get once hurricanes (especially Hurricane Katrina)hit and harm America. Also,there would not be as many people out there who,while they have run into dangerous weather in the ocean,have been fortunate enough to be rescued by the United States Coast Guard. And,with all of the great service that the United States Coast Guard has brought and continues to bring to the United States,it is great to have ""The Guardian""--a film that not only pays great homage to the United States Coast Guard,but is a very strong film,itself.This film starts off by going into the life of Ben Randall (Kevin Costner). At this point in the film,despite all of the success that Ben has had and all of the respect that he has earned as a member of the United States Coast Guard,things in his life are not going well for him at this period in his life. Alongside being a part of two failed operations that were held within the United States Coast Guard,at the same time,Ben finds his marriage to his wife,Helen Randall(Sela Ward)falling apart. And,depsite the fact that Ben Randall has tried to make the best effort that he can to keep his job and marriage together,neither two end up to be successful,something that does not stop taking its negative toll on Ben's life....However,shortly after Ben Randall has had his two failed operations withinthe United States Coast Guard and finds his marriage starting to fall apart,luck comes for Ben. Once Ben has gotten a job as an instructor to young trainees who are trying to join the United States Coast Guard,Ben feels that this will be a really good way to reform himself and his mistakes,as well as his marriage. At the same time,Ben does not feel that there will be any problems involved in being the instructor of the trainees who are training to be in the United States Coast Guard,and takes the job.However,once Ben Randall has begun his new job as an instructor,he is proven to be wrong with his feeling of not having any problems with his new job. This is when Ben has gotten to know one of his students,Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher). Jake,a former high school student with a very impressive and respectable background as a swimmer on his high school swimming team (who is also in the class that Ben is now teaching for the third time),has his own plans for his service in the United States Coast Guard,and is prepared to make sure that he is the person that benefits the most from his service in the U.S. Coast Guard. This causes a lot of problems between Ben and Jake. But,once Ben and Jake are at each other,and once both Ben and Jake have learned about each other,this movie not only picks up at a higher pace,but proves itself to be very interesting and suspenseful,with a lot of drama and good insight into the lives of the characters of Ben and Jake,at the same time.When it comes down to ""The Guardian"",be warned--this film,at times,is very slow (not too bad,but enough to be mentioned and made aware of)and is a very lengthy film (clocking in at two hours and twenty minutes). Yet,despite all of those flaws of ""The Guardian"",it still is really good,otherwise. Not only does ""The Guardian"" do a good job at showing a firsthand account of the United States Coast Guard and what the U.S. Coast Guard is like (it is worth noting that the U.S. Coast Guard themselves appear in this film alongside the actors in this film),the way it is structured as a film pulls it off really well. The script that is accompanying this film's plot does a good job at taking its time and containing not only strong elements of drama,but also a lot of suspense that not only keeps its viewers entertained,but makes its viewers wonder what will happen next,at the same time. However,the most worthwhile parts of this film that definitely derserve their recognition are,by far,the performances of Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher. Here,Kevin Costner does a good job at bringing his character of Ben Randall to life and letting viewers of this film know who Ben Randall is as a person,by taking the route of bringing the onstage personalities he has brought into his other films(""JFK"",""Dragonfly"",etc.)into his performance of Ben Randall that is to be found here. As for Ashton Kutcher's performance as Jake Fischer,throughout this entire film,Kutcher gets to know his character better by not only bringing out his (Kutcher's)serious side of an actor (something that people did not envision at first,but have been shown over the years with Kutcher's roles in films such as ""The Butterfly Effect"" and ""Bobby"")and blending it in with his comedic side as an actor (something that everyone is aware of). With the way that Kevin Costner portrays Ben Randall and the way that Ashton Kutcher portrays Jake Fischer,Costner and Kutcher both do an excellent job at blending their personalties as actors (two personalities that have proven to be very different from each other over the years,but not too differently recently with Kutcher taking on more serious film roles)onto the screen,which brings this film more chemistry and is a contribution to this film being entertaining,at the same time.It is also worth nothing that the DVD edition of this film has a lot of interesting bonus feautures on it. Here,not only do you see the alternate ending for this film that was originally going to be used to end this film (with some good insight from this film's director,Andrew Davis,as to why the ending was not used),a good selection of this film's deleted scenes,a behind the scenes look into the making of this film,a tribute to the swimmers of the United States Coast Guard,a couple of sneak peeks,and a good audio commentary from both Andrew Davis and Ron L. Brinkherhoff (this film's writer). These bonus feautures are not only worthwhile,but do a good job at making this DVD a good package,at the same time.Overall,a very strong and well written film,with good elements of both drama and comedy. If you are a fan of Kevin Costner and/or Ashton Kutcher and have enjoyed other films such as ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""The Fugitive"",""The Guardian"" is the film to watch.4/5",4,"Lengthy,and slow

1033646,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000KF0GWW,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[5, 5]","The Guardian is a tribute to a unique breed of individuals who do what few can or are willing to do.  Think of how the job description of a Coast Guard might look:  You must be on call at all times and willing to go out in the open ocean during violent terrible weather that even United States Military would not venture into.  In addition, you must be willing to sacrifice yourself for complete strangers which may include your drowning or freezing to death.These men, the members of our coast guard, are what I call quiet unsung heroes as their risks and sacrifices often go unnoticed, unlike our police and firemen who are just as heroic, but often get the recognition they deserve.  This film gives the coast guard the recognition they so rightly deserve.  Hollywood makes movies to make money, but it's nice when they also pay respect to people and causes in that drive to make a profit.  I think of films like World Trade Center, The Towering Inferno, Volcano, Flags of our Fathers, Platoon, Stand and Deliver, and Mr. Holland's Opus where Hollywood appropriately pays tribute to our police, firemen, emergency personnel of all types, soldiers, and educators who all contribute so much to our society in such an unselfish manner.  Films like The Guardian give an appropriate ""thank you"" to such individuals.As far as the movie specifically goes, I completely enjoyed this film although it is a bit overly long and a bit predictable, hence my 4 stars and not 5.  Kevin Costner has matured wonderfully as an actor.  His boyish charm has given way to something of a world-weary traveler and it suits him.  Ashton Kutcher plays the role of the young arrogant upstart that would have been played by Tom Cruise in his more youthful days.  Kutcher proves he's got acting chops and is an acting force to be reckoned with.  He, like Costner, is maturing nicely.  Sela Ward, forever typecast as the neglected spouse, offers solid and sensitive support as do all the other familiar supporting actors that you will recognize from other countless films.The writing is overall believable except near the end where it gets predictable and a bit overly sentimental, but enjoyable nevertheless.  This film could use some editing.  One gets the feeling that the director just loved every shot and sequence and couldn't bring himself to edit this nearly 2 1/2 hour film down to a more appropriate 2 hours.Regardless of my few criticisms of this film, this is a must see and, perhaps, a must own DVD.  I took my kids to see this just so they could appreciate the heroic efforts so many people do for complete strangers.  At 10 and 14 they both left the theaters in tears as they were so moved by this story.  To me, that speaks more than any other words I could write here.God Bless the rescuers that surround us!",4,A Song of Praise to Unsung Heroes,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,2799,"['Guardian', 'tribute', 'unique', 'breed', 'individuals', 'who', 'do', 'what', 'few', 'can', 'are', 'willing', 'do', 'Think', 'how', 'job', 'description', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'might', 'look', 'must', 'be', 'call', 'times', 'willing', 'go', 'out', 'open', 'ocean', 'violent', 'terrible', 'weather', 'even', 'United', 'States', 'Military', 'would', 'not', 'venture', 'addition', 'must', 'be', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'complete', 'strangers', 'may', 'include', 'drowning', 'freezing', 'death.These', 'men', 'members', 'coast', 'guard', 'are', 'what', 'call', 'quiet', 'unsung', 'heroes', 'risks', 'sacrifices', 'often', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'police', 'firemen', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'heroic', 'often', 'get', 'recognition', 'deserve', 'film', 'coast', 'guard', 'recognition', 'so', 'rightly', 'deserve', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'make', 'money', 'nice', 'when', 'also', 'pay', 'respect', 'people', 'causes', 'drive', 'make', 'profit', 'think', 'films', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Towering', 'Inferno', 'Volcano', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'Platoon', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'where', 'Hollywood', 'appropriately', 'tribute', 'police', 'firemen', 'emergency', 'personnel', 'types', 'soldiers', 'educators', 'who', 'contribute', 'so', 'much', 'society', 'such', 'unselfish', 'manner', 'Films', 'Guardian', 'give', 'appropriate', 'thank', 'such', 'individuals.As', 'far', 'movie', 'specifically', 'completely', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'bit', 'overly', 'long', 'bit', 'predictable', 'hence', '4', 'stars', 'not', '5', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'matured', 'wonderfully', 'actor', 'boyish', 'charm', 'given', 'way', 'something', 'world-weary', 'traveler', 'suits', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'role', 'young', 'arrogant', 'upstart', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'more', 'youthful', 'days', 'Kutcher', 'got', 'acting', 'chops', 'acting', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Costner', 'maturing', 'nicely', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'forever', 'typecast', 'neglected', 'spouse', 'solid', 'sensitive', 'support', 'do', 'other', 'familiar', 'supporting', 'actors', 'will', 'recognize', 'other', 'countless', 'films.The', 'writing', 'overall', 'believable', 'end', 'where', 'predictable', 'bit', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'enjoyable', 'nevertheless', 'film', 'could', 'use', 'editing', 'One', 'feeling', 'director', 'just', 'loved', 'shot', 'sequence', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'edit', 'nearly', '2', '1/2', 'hour', 'film', 'down', 'more', 'appropriate', '2', 'hours.Regardless', 'few', 'criticisms', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'perhaps', 'must', 'own', 'DVD', 'took', 'kids', 'see', 'just', 'could', 'appreciate', 'heroic', 'efforts', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'complete', 'strangers', '10', '14', 'left', 'theaters', 'tears', 'were', 'so', 'moved', 'story', 'more', 'other', 'words', 'could', 'write', 'here.God', 'Bless', 'rescuers', 'surround']",N/A

The movie ""feels"" a lot like Top Gun, except instead of Tom Cruise, you get Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher leading the way.The movie is about the U.S. Coast Guard. Though the majority of the movie is about the training school, the best action takes place in the Bering Sea.  It gives you an idea of what the real Coast Guard must go through, and it can give you new found respect for them.  There is line in the movie to the effect of, ""Everyone forgets we're here until we are needed.""  Don't sue me if didn't get that line exactly right, but you get the point.You also get to see a lot of what the Coast Guard goes through in training to be a Rescue Swimmer.  Obviously the hardest job they have.  This part of movie shows a lot of the training they go through, but probably focuses more on character building and the relationships they form.All in all, it is a very good movie.

They expose much in the way of the life of a rescue swimmer, and really what the USCG is all about.  Ashton Kutcher is well-chosen in the role he plays as the competitive young adult just beginning in his training and career as a rescue swimmer.  Special Features on this flick are great to watch, educational.  Alternate ending is available in the special features, which I must admit I preferred over the one they chose for the big screen.  Very Kevin Costner-ish.  Though he is a superb actor, there is a certain hero-like quality that he always wants to impress upon you in his movies, which I don't care for.

To be honest, I thought they deserved better than this rather formulaic, predictable story (especially the odd beginning and matching end). The sea rescue scenes are well done, and you cannot help but admire the people who really do this for a living. In that regard, the film succeeds very well. The training/rivalry/romance bits are just the usual old Hollywood boilerplate grafted on, things you've seen many times before. Kevin Costner, who can be very good, does a sort of strong, silent wooden Indian impersonation, and the young hotshot is, well, a typical Hollywood hotshot.Nevertheless, there are worse ways of spending a couple of hours (it was rather long too).",3,Entertaining enough,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,990,"['was', 'attracted', 'rescue', 'scenes', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'alerted', 'fact', 'US', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'swimmers', 'actually', 'jump', 'raging', 'seas', 'rescue', 'people.So', 'was', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'courageous', 'men', 'women', 'US', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'who', 'put', 'lives', 'line', 'mariners', 'distress', 'be', 'honest', 'thought', 'deserved', 'better', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'predictable', 'story', 'especially', 'odd', 'beginning', 'matching', 'end', 'sea', 'rescue', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'admire', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'do', 'living', 'regard', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'training/rivalry/romance', 'bits', 'are', 'just', 'usual', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'boilerplate', 'grafted', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'sort', 'strong', 'silent', 'wooden', 'Indian', 'impersonation', 'young', 'hotshot', 'well', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'hotshot.Nevertheless', 'are', 'worse', 'ways', 'spending', 'couple', 'hours', 'was', 'rather', 'long', 'too']",N/A

Though the production description includes the phrase `action-packed,' ""The Guardian"" is not all about `actions.' Considerable time is spent to show the relations between characters, especially Costner's Ben Randall, veteran rescuer/instructor and Kutcher's Jake Fischer, talented but slightly arrogant trainee.""The Guardian"" opens with two powerful scenes about the Coast Guard's rescue swimmers, which follow the heroic actions of them out in the stormy sea to save the lives of the shipwrecked. The compelling rescue mission scenes, especially the second one, would grab your attention with stunning visuals helped by taut editing.And then, the film slows down. The film's middle portion is about the trainees during the 18 week training course, but the problem is not this setting. Even if you have not seen ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" or ""Top Gun"" -- Why should you? They are made back in the 1980s - the father-son-like relationship between Ben and Jake would seem very familiar. Ben is a legendary rescuer; he lives separated from his wife and he needs some rest. Jake is a hot-shot swimmer; he dates with a local teacher and he has some past trauma. All these elements are not impressive very much, but good performances from Costner and Kutcher, and capable supports from Neal McDonough, John Heard, and Clancy Brown manage to convince us of the film's characters' lives.I don't see anything bad about the film, but I don't know why this should be so long.

1033659,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000KF0GWW,Wayne C. Rogers,"[6, 7]","Even though The Guardian was panned by most of the major critics when it came out, I decided to trust the reviews on Amazon.com this time around.  Besides, I'm from the coast of North Carolina and half of my relatives served in the Coast Guard, while the other half served in the Marine Corp.  This is a movie I needed to see.  The Guardian is the first film ever done about the United States Coast Guard, especially its courageous Rescue Swimmers.  As Kevin Costner says in the movie, ""No one ever thinks about the Coast Guard, until they're needed.""  If you live on the ocean, or anywhere near the ocean, you're use to seeing Coast Guard boats on a regular basis.  What most of the public isn't aware of are the young men and women who repeatedly jump into raging waves during the middle of a storm to rescue people who didn't have the good sense to stay on shore that night.  Or even more important, these are the people who went into New Orleans to save the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  These are the best of the best, and they put their lives on the line time and time again so ""that others might live.""  This is the famous motto of the Coast Guard, and the theme of The Guardian.Having been compared to the movie, An Officer and a Gentleman, Andrew Davis' The Guardian stars Kevin Costner as the heroic Ben Randall, who's now in his forties and recovering from the tragic deaths of everyone in his crew and the breakup of his marriage to the beautiful Sela Ward.  Randall, having saved more people than any other Rescue Swimmer, is given the choice of resigning his position as Senior Chief, or training the raw recruits who seek to become the elite of the Coast Guard.  Ashton Kutcher plays the young cocky recruit, Jake Fischer, who wants to break all of Randall's records.  Naturally, both men will knock heads with each other during the eighteen weeks of training, until they both begin to realize just how much they have in common.  Both of the men has each suffered a great tragedy and the bonding with each other will eventually lead them to a sense of redemption.  During the course of the film, Jake also falls in love with a lovely schoolteacher who's played by Melissa Sagemiller.  I wish I'd had her as a teacher when I was in school!  Together, they seem like a younger version of Ben Randall and his wife.  Once the training is finally over, Jake will have to face the reality of what it means to put your life on the line for complete strangers, while Ben has to find out if he still has what it takes to be a Rescue Swimmer.Though the movie is almost two-and-a-half hours long, it seemed more like ninety minutes.  From the opening moments of the film to its powerful, tear-filled ending, I was caught up in the characters and their trials and tribulations.  I was never bored.  Like a lot of viewers, I was able to guess most of what was going to happen, but this never took away from my enjoyment of the film.  I will admit to being a little surprised at the ending.  I was expecting something else.  I'm glad everyone involved with the movie decided to take a chance and go with it, even though an alternate ending had been shot.  This certainly made for a more gut-wrenching experience than the typical ending that most moviegoers are familiar with.  I also felt that all the performances were quite strong, even the smaller roles played by John Heard, Clancy Brown, Sela Ward, and Neal McDonough.  There was one particular scene in the movie that got me laughing.  It's when Kevin Costner's character takes Ashton Kutcher back into the same Navy bar where Kutcher was just beat up.  One of the men who pounded on Kutcher walks arrogantly up to the bar and wants to know if Costner is Kutcher's dad.  It's hard to believe that so much time has now passed that Costner is looked upon as the ""father"" figure in today's films.  Field of Dreams, Dances With Wolves, and The Bodyguard all seem like they were done yesterday.  I guess we're all getting old.  I have to also say that I'm not much of an ""Ashton Kutcher"" fan, but this movie won me over.  I was impressed with how he held his own with Costner.  This is a young man who's on his way to becoming a very, very good actor.  The Guardian is a well-made, entertaining film that takes a close look at the men and women you can count on to be there when they're needed--the Rescue Swimmers of the United States Coast Guard.  The DVD has about twenty-five minutes of extras, including a look at the real Rescue Swimmers, the making of The Guardian, and the alternate ending that was shot, but fortunately was never used.

Unfortunately, it is.Most of the film is the standard man-with-serious-problem-coming-to-grips-with-it tale mixed with arrogant-youngster-challenging-the-old-guard story we've seen far too many times. But it works fairly well, because it's underplayed, and (at least for this viewer) there's the novelty of the Coast Guard training program.There's also the novelty, towards the end of the film, of Kevin Costner awakening from his usual torpor to deliver a convincing performance.The problem is the end. It's so ludicrously over the top, one can only assume the writers were following the rule of ""negating the negation"" * too closely. It's so overdone, with every rescue-scene clich&eacute; trotted out, it's impossible not to laugh -- even when characters are dead or threatened with death. As the classic wisecrack goes, ""There's not a damp eye in the house"". (This is especially unfortunate in a movie about sea rescues.)This is bad enough. But when we're led to believe that (plot spoiler) the deceased Costner has become The Guardian -- a sea creature who saves the drowning -- all semblance of plausibility is lost.
