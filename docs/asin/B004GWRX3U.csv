1407396,A1TSN78JHYHD6R,B004GWRX3U,harry bitzer,"[0, 1]",This version was kind of disappointing for the price. Quality pretty much what I expected after 5o years but many of these scenes are chopped.  For example the 3 minute clock after 2 minutes seems to punch ahead to near the end.It would have been nice if all the intemissions would have had their own breaks!  trying to show these intermissions between movies is a real challenge.  i did notice that there is another production out at a little higher price.  Hopefully it'll be improved over the previous copy.  That production only has one write up of 4 stars.  I would like to see a few more write in's on that before buying!,3,HOPING NEWER VERSION MORE COMPLETE,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",2013,627,"['version', 'was', 'kind', 'disappointing', 'price', 'Quality', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'expected', '5o', 'years', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'chopped', 'example', '3', 'minute', 'clock', '2', 'minutes', 'punch', 'ahead', 'end.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'intemissions', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'own', 'breaks', 'trying', 'show', 'intermissions', 'movies', 'real', 'challenge', 'i', 'did', 'notice', 'production', 'out', 'little', 'higher', 'price', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'improved', 'previous', 'copy', 'production', 'only', 'one', 'write', '4', 'stars', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'few', 'more', 'write', 'buying']",N/A

1407398,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B004GWRX3U,Michael Valdivielso,"[3, 3]","That's right, it is intermission time!  So head over to the refreshment stand and have yourself a ice-cold soda.  Or popcorn drowning in butter.  Real butter not that used car-oil stuff they use now.  This DVD has all the ads they showed during intermission, from getting you to go wolf down some salt snack goods to ads for businesses, holidays, and special offers from the drive-in or theater, like free tickets and, of course, more free FOOD!The DVD also holds classic movie trailers from movies you may, or may not, know.  Frankly, its a lot of fun.  I suggest making some popcorn, or grabbing a pizza, turning off the lights and watching it with some friends.I would also suggest two books to go with it.American Drive-in Movie Theater (Motorbooks Classic)and60 Great Sci-Fi Movie Posters: Volume 20 of the Illustrated History of Movies Through Posters (Illustrated History of Movies Through Posters, Volume 20)which I think you will really enjoy if you enjoyed this DVD.",5,Yummy hot dogs!

Summer, the stars, the fresh air, the movies, and of course the food from the concession stand which would be endlessly advertised between shows.

What fun it would be to goon a warm summer's night, put that metal speaker on the window, get dressed in pajamas, and watch a double feature with mom and dad. Sometimes there was a kiddie playground at the drive-in as well, but the best was visiting the magical concession stand with its assorted treats. These treats were made even more magical because of the weird, quaint, and often goofy intermission ads these theaters would run to drum up snack sales. This dvd has quite a collection of these odd little ads, marching hot dogs, retro cartoons, zippy jingles, its all here just as you remember them from the 50s and 60s. Some of the ads are a bit grainy, as such films were often poorly preserved due to their ephemeral nature.
