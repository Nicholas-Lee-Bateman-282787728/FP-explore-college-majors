Annette O'Toole, as his 4th wife, is a successful lawyer, completely at a loss when trying to deal with her husband who viciously manipulates and humiliates her, then surprises her by doing something loving.But Brad is through with the marriage when he meets a well-to-do if naive doctor played by Lindsay Frost, who believes in Brad completely.Olin does a superb job as the bad guy, as does O'Toole as his wife.  The other actors don't match their intensity---the movie belongs to Olin and O'Toole.The support system that Cunningham's fourth, very liberated wife had was amazing, but it didn't save her from being killed.

Full of suspense and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  One you don't want to miss a second of.  Annette O'Toole played an excellent part of being the 3rd wife.  Ken Olin was truly off in the head.  Got his wives before he married them to believe his every word and once married did the same, than he started to get mean.  For this to have really happened in life and they made a movie out of it, is shocking and hard to believe that these women went through pure heck with this man.  This is a must see. Once you watch it, you will want to watch it over and over again. I haven't purchased the DVD yet but will.  So not sure if any of it is cut from the original movie that was on True Stories Channel (which it's not called True movies anymore not sure what that channel is called now as I don't have movie channels.) I'd say it would be one to get because no matter the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. This truly a domestic violence and beyond movie.  Hard to believe a man could do any of these deep mind games with the women he married and put them pure heck. The man was truly insane and that's putting it mildly.The forth wife ended up finding justice for the third wife that was murdered and did a very good job of how she done that.  I'm was so glad that justice prevailed on something that happened in life.The DVD needed to be out long before this. I'd like to find out if this movie came out on DVD from the True Movie channel, because that would be uncut.
