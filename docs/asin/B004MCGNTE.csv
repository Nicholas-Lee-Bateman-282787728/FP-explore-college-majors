1419853,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B004MCGNTE,California Dreaming,"[1, 2]","Amanda Knox is a student at the University of Washington, just as I was in the 90s, although I've never met her.  Yes, she has a lot more money than I do; doing ill-advised interviews for network television will do that for you.  And yes, she's far ""prettier"" than I am, although I'm a guy so I'm not sure that's a fair comparison.  (It kind of reminds me of that commercial where the gal wakes up in the middle of the night, and thinks that her husband's having an affair, as he's whispering on the phone.  Yeah, he's having an affair with a ""dude"" from State Farm that's wearing khakis.)  And finally yes, she speaks Italian, and all that I can muster in that language is to order a latte or spaghetti, as I've been to Italy a couple of times.  But nonetheless, I wouldn't trade places with her for anything in the world.After all, she's facing her third trial currently, which is surely lame as Italy should have a double jeopardy law, just like the United States.  (To be fair, however, she was found guilty the first time, and she got a new trial the second time which set her free, which surely didn't upset her.)  And I believe that she is still facing charges for implicating her old boss for a murder, a murder in which she supposedly knew nothing.  (I saw Ms. Knox on an interview and she seemed to feel truly remorseful about this one.)  And while she's not in Italy currently -- I think that she's back at the good ol' U Dub, taking classes in the wonderful rain and cold of Seattle -- she won't return to Italy if found guilty.  She probably won't return either way would be my guess; would you if you were in her shoes?But still, if she's found guilty the second time, she will be a prisoner in her own land.  Why?  Well, let's say she flies outside US borders, even to some Virgin Islands.  And let's say that there is an emergency, and the flight is diverted.  If she ended up in a non-US territory, she could be extradited back to Italy immediately.  That option is not optional; the risk will be too great.Of course, this film is somewhat of a different story.  While I really liked the lead here (she looks like Ms. Knox and ""channels"" her a bit as well), I liked neither the tone nor the writing.  I felt that this was way too one-sided, one-sided on the side of Ms. Knox.  It would have been much better as a balanced affair in my opinion.And why is it that people from a country always are on the side of their own countrymen, when those countrymen are arrested abroad?  Well, you and I both know the reason:  people are not objective, just like this film.  Who knows what really happened?  I would imagine that Meredith Kercher knows, although she took that knowledge to her grave.  And the person -- or people -- who killed her surely know as well, although they will never talk, unless, say, one of them ""gets religion"" perhaps, and then has a change of conscience, and eventually fesses up.  But that is highly unlikely.  After all, this isn't the movies.  It's only TV.When you make a film -- even one that is made-for-TV, as I believe this one was -- you still owe it to your audience to remain objective.  I think that this one did not, so I'm going to have to give it an unfortunate pass.

1419855,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004MCGNTE,DVD Verdict,"[4, 7]","Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Ignoring all the real-life hubbub about Kercher and Knox, Murder on Trial in Italy is an okay made-for-TV film. Hayden Panettiere does a fine job making Knox a bit ambiguous. She doesn't play her as the trumped-up sexpot of the media, nor as the innocent angel her supporters would have you believe in. Instead, she's confused young woman who we can't quite believe. Some of her actions can put down to her age and inexperience, but others are a bit more troubling. Knox's supposed partner in crime, Guiliano Mignini, is ably played by Vincent Riotta, who bears a striking resemblance to his real-life counterpart in some shots. The film also managed to snag the dependable Marcia Gay Harden as Amanda's mother. She's the one responsible for really driving home the prosecutorial aspect of Amanda's treatment.Despite the sensational aspects of the film's title, and the trial, the film could be a lot worse. Sticking to a fairly simple flashback structure, it starts with the discovery of the body and works backwards to fill in the details of Amanda's life.Amanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italy comes to DVD in a simple, solid package. The anamorphic widescreen transfer is bright and colorful, belying the dark nature of the story. I didn't notice any significant compression or authoring problems, and this DVD looks about as good as you can expect from contemporary television.

1419859,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004MCGNTE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 4]","Anyone familiar with the realm of Lifetime made-for-TV movies can readily identify their ""ripped from the headlines"" approach toward notorious legal cases. This tried and true formula has been evidenced in countless Lifetime films through the years and I'm quite sure that there will be little deviation from established success. At times, though, one would have to consider--when is it too soon? With the 2011 premiere of ""Amanda Knox: Murder On Trial In Italy,"" the question becomes all the more relevant. The movie aired in February, just two months after an appeal was granted for the real life Knox and in the same month her parents were indicted by Italian police for abuse claims they were making publicly. In reality, this particular incident is still very much under scrutiny and alive in the legal system. So to have it tried as a fictionalized TV movie seems somehow suspect. While the film doesn't make an outright proclamation of actual events, it certainly seems to endorse the position that Knox is guilty. And whether or not she is--it seems that there is no need to unnecessarily muddy the waters with a ""based on"" accounting that amounts to a great deal of fiction for dramatic purposes.Off my soapbox, I will now look at ""Amanda Knox: Murder On Trial In Italy"" as a purely fabricated account for entertainment purposes. Hayden Panettiere portrays Knox, an American student studying in Italy who is accused of participating in the sexual assault and murder of her British roommate. Her actions, along with her boyfriend, are immediately drawn into question when the body is discovered at the beginning of the film. With her story not ringing true, Knox is subjected to an intense police investigation in which her story varies dramatically along the way. Eventually, three people (including Knox) are brought to trial for this brutal crime. As far as the investigation, the film does a good job in dramatizing the sequence of events as well as the evidentiary trail. The actors are capable and the film strives for an even handed tone. The actual trial seems a bit rushed--but, all in all, (discounting your personal feelings on the matter) this is a fairly successful fictional crime drama.Fans of Panettiere may appreciate this change-of-pace role, but despite a couple of nice moments--she has realtively little to work with. Knox is portrayed as a somewhat distant character and, as such, appears throughout the film as emotionally disconnected and blank. More concerned with canoodling with her boyfriend than in facing the realities of a police investigation, it certainly isn't a role that elicits much sympathy. One of our greatest character actors, Marcia Gay Harden, is on hand as Knox's mother--but is largely underutilized. For me, it is Vincent Riotta who provides the film's most compelling depiction as the prosecutor in charge of the case. As a made-for-TV movie, this really isn't a terrible film--in fact, it is a very decent police procedural even as it plays fast and loose with the actual facts. As a fiction, it's fine--but it is fiction!

1419869,AW594B7HH4YUY,B004MCGNTE,The Deacon,"[0, 1]","As movies made for television go, I found this Lifetime production to be a decent film overall.  There's clearly some exploitation going on of a salacious international news story still in the headlines, but I don't think it was done in an unreasonable way.Hayden Panettiere plays Amanda Knox, the now well-known American exchange student in Italy who was accused of the murder of Meredith Kercher, a British university student also studying there.  Her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and Rudy Guede, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, are also accused of the murder.  The facts as painted by the police and prosecution make for a tantalizing tale almost perfectly made for exploitation and hype by news tabloids and other media.The film shows events unfolding in a mostly procedural manner with occasional flashbacks to earlier events involving Amanda and the ill-fated Meredith.  Not all of the details that can be found in media accounts made it into the film, but the most significant ones did and are handled in an effective and expeditious manner.  The same is true for the later police interrogations and the trial proceedings.  This is not a documentary, but I actually can't find too much fault with how events were portrayed in the film.  The confusing and conflicting accounts that can be found across the large body of media articles are also present in the film with roughly equivalent balance for different parties.The movie is a OK adaptation overall.  There are no earth-shattering revelations since the international news media has already covered the various accounts, accusations, theories, and hyperbole in substantial detail.  However, I found a film-based presentation interesting in linking those details together in a way that events unfolded and as how those events would have seemed to the people involved.  Panettiere does a decent job in portraying Amanda as a free-spirited young woman experiencing life for the first time in a foreign country and in showing her reactions as the ordeal of Meredith's murder and its investigation begins.  Marcia Gay Harden makes an impression as Amanda's mother with her limited screentime.  Vincent Riotta is effective as prosecutor Guiliano Mignini, who is the lead figure in representing the local legal authorities.Although the film is somewhat sympathetic toward Amanda, it also presents details about her that contributed to Italian authorities focusing on her.  Drug use and a perhaps overly care-free spirit generally don't enamor one with the law-and-order types that inhabit most law enforcement organizations, and those aspects of Amanda seem fairly presented.  However, much of the behavior of the police and prosecution is also confusing, especially to those who may be accustomed to different legal systems than that found in Italy.  That is as much a part of the news story as anything else, and I think it's fairly depicted in the film.I recommend the film for anyone interested in the real-life story.  It adds to the narrative through its story-based presentation of events and human portrayal by the actors.  It has the usual constraints of TV productions, but I think the majority of flaws in the narrative come from the muddled affair of the real events.",4,Decent TV adaptation of confusing events,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,3244,"['movies', 'made', 'television', 'go', 'found', 'Lifetime', 'production', 'be', 'decent', 'film', 'overall', 'clearly', 'exploitation', 'going', 'salacious', 'international', 'news', 'story', 'still', 'headlines', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'done', 'unreasonable', 'way.Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'Amanda', 'Knox', 'now', 'well-known', 'American', 'exchange', 'student', 'Italy', 'who', 'was', 'accused', 'murder', 'Meredith', 'Kercher', 'British', 'university', 'student', 'also', 'studying', 'there', 'Italian', 'boyfriend', 'Raffaele', 'Sollecito', 'Rudy', 'Guede', 'immigrant', 'Ivory', 'Coast', 'are', 'also', 'accused', 'murder', 'facts', 'painted', 'police', 'prosecution', 'make', 'tantalizing', 'tale', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'made', 'exploitation', 'hype', 'news', 'tabloids', 'other', 'media.The', 'film', 'events', 'unfolding', 'mostly', 'procedural', 'manner', 'occasional', 'flashbacks', 'earlier', 'events', 'involving', 'Amanda', 'ill-fated', 'Meredith', 'Not', 'details', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'media', 'accounts', 'made', 'film', 'most', 'significant', 'ones', 'did', 'are', 'handled', 'effective', 'expeditious', 'manner', 'same', 'true', 'later', 'police', 'interrogations', 'trial', 'proceedings', 'not', 'documentary', 'actually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'much', 'fault', 'how', 'events', 'were', 'portrayed', 'film', 'confusing', 'conflicting', 'accounts', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'large', 'body', 'media', 'articles', 'are', 'also', 'present', 'film', 'roughly', 'equivalent', 'balance', 'different', 'parties.The', 'movie', 'OK', 'adaptation', 'overall', 'are', 'earth-shattering', 'revelations', 'international', 'news', 'media', 'already', 'covered', 'various', 'accounts', 'accusations', 'theories', 'hyperbole', 'substantial', 'detail', 'However', 'found', 'film-based', 'presentation', 'interesting', 'linking', 'details', 'together', 'way', 'events', 'unfolded', 'how', 'events', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'people', 'involved', 'Panettiere', 'decent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Amanda', 'free-spirited', 'young', 'woman', 'experiencing', 'life', 'first', 'time', 'foreign', 'country', 'showing', 'reactions', 'ordeal', 'Meredith', 'murder', 'investigation', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'impression', 'Amanda', 'mother', 'limited', 'screentime', 'Vincent', 'Riotta', 'effective', 'prosecutor', 'Guiliano', 'Mignini', 'who', 'lead', 'figure', 'representing', 'local', 'legal', 'film', 'somewhat', 'sympathetic', 'Amanda', 'also', 'details', 'contributed', 'Italian', 'authorities', 'focusing', 'Drug', 'use', 'perhaps', 'overly', 'care-free', 'spirit', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'enamor', 'one', 'law-and-order', 'types', 'inhabit', 'most', 'law', 'enforcement', 'organizations', 'aspects', 'Amanda', 'seem', 'fairly', 'presented', 'However', 'much', 'behavior', 'police', 'prosecution', 'also', 'confusing', 'especially', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'accustomed', 'different', 'legal', 'systems', 'found', 'Italy', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'news', 'story', 'anything', 'else', 'think', 'fairly', 'depicted', 'film.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'interested', 'real-life', 'story', 'narrative', 'story-based', 'presentation', 'events', 'human', 'portrayal', 'actors', 'usual', 'constraints', 'TV', 'productions', 'think', 'majority', 'flaws', 'narrative', 'come', 'muddled', 'affair', 'real', 'events']",Amanda Knox: Murder On Trial In Italy
