For me, SS is the hardest of the three due to the upper body work with weights (I only had two pound weights but will try it with one pounders). This has Ellen's signature moves: skater, second position plies, lunges, butterfly and some very unique and nice stretches at the end.

1143454,A1U29Y7SURFRHQ,B0013KGWBM,Anonymous,"[3, 3]","This workout uses light weights (3 lbs) to tone the arms and shoulders, without building bulky muscles. I was amazed at how challenging 3 lb weights can be (I usually use 5 or 8 lbs with Kathy Smith). I can barely make it through all the exercises with the 3 lb weights and feel sore and great the next day. It's true, there's not much lower body emphasis, so I don't think this workout would be great on its own, but combined with Ellen's Yogini and Fat Burning Fusion DVDs with both focus more on the lower body, it's perfect. Slim Sculpt also contains some great standing core work, and works well with Ellen's Fat Burning Pilates or Self workouts, which I also love.

I do this workout with 3 lb weights, and wouldn't use anything heavier. There is a lot of upper body work, but also plenty of side lunges and glute work, too. The floor exercises are tough, but not impossible - it's probably wise to pace yourself and just do what you can without forcing things. I definitely feel realigned and relaxed when it's all over.

1143457,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0013KGWBM,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[1, 1]","This is the second workout that I have tried in Ellen Barrett's studio series.  Although I didn't click very well with some of her older workouts (e.g., Crunch Pick Your Spot Pilates), I recently tried and loved herFusion Flow, so I thought I would look into to some of her other newer DVDs.As with all of her studio workouts, Ellen performs this routine barefoot in a large, open studio.  She has two background exercisers, Debra and Meg, who modifies the exercises to be performed without weights.  The only equipment used is a mat and LIGHT weights (at most 3#, but even that felt heavy to me for many of the movements).  The Main Menu offers options for Play All, Chapter Selection, and Greetings from the Studio!Although this workout is well-chaptered, the chapters flow into each other rather than have defined start/end points.  However, I will use the names which appear on the chapter menu to describe each segment in greater detail below (all times are approximate).Warm-Up (5 minutes)Ellen begins with gentle breaths in and out, arm circles, and plies; she concludes the warm-up with an inner thigh stretch.Side Leg Lift Series (5.5 minutes)Ellen picks up the weights for this segment and begins with a side arm lift, palms up/palms down.  She transitions into side-to-side leg lifts, continuing with arm movements.  This move ends with a squat circle.  She also performs ""butterfly arms"" (wide, circling arms) while doing plies from side-to-side.  She repeats the whole series, this time lifting the leg to the rear.Plie Stance Series (9.5 minutes)Ellen continues to use the weights for even more arms work in this section.  Standing in a Pilates stance, she performs moves including side reaches, shoulder presses, big circles with plies, triceps overhead presses, sun arms, Pilates arm circles, Pilates chest expander, and additional butterfly arms.  The legs get just a bit of work with a set of static lunges to either side.Pulley Arms Lunge (9.5 minutes)The name of this segment describes the first move:  a single leg lunge with a one-arm ""pulley"" move to the rear.  Additional moves include whisps around the body, back extensions with lasso arms, single and double arm rows, and again, just a bit of legs work with skater squats.Mat Work (10.5 minutes)Ellen begins here with a twisting move from a reclined seated position.  She then comes to lying for some Pilates-inspired matwork, including single leg stretch, ballerina criss-cross, partial to full rollup, and knee drops (progressively adding increased challenge).Final Stretch (5 minutes)Ellen starts the stretch in cobbler's pose for a rocking butterfly move; she also performs some hip lifts.  Additional stretches include a seated twist, cross-legged forward bend, and brief neck/shoulder stretches to finish.Overall, I enjoyed this workout.  It definitely had more of an upper body emphasis, although I was aware of that going in.  However, I found it a bit difficult to find the right amount of weight to use consistently throughout the workout.  I started off with 3#, but this quickly felt too heavy.  I switched to 2#, which was better, but I found that I liked doing some movements, such as the butterfly arms, much better without the weights.  So, the second time I did the workout, I tried it WITHOUT the weights for most of the exercises (I still used weights for the tricep work and rows), and I found this to be much more to my liking, as I got better range of motion from the movements.I am glad I discovered Ellen's studio series and would definitely recommend these DVDs.",4,Enjoyable workout with strong arm toning emphasis,1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,3564,"['second', 'workout', 'have', 'tried', 'Ellen', 'Barrett', 'studio', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'click', 'very', 'well', 'older', 'workouts', 'e.g.', 'Crunch', 'Pick', 'Your', 'Spot', 'Pilates', 'recently', 'tried', 'loved', 'herFusion', 'Flow', 'thought', 'would', 'look', 'other', 'newer', 'DVDs.As', 'studio', 'workouts', 'Ellen', 'routine', 'barefoot', 'large', 'open', 'studio', 'two', 'background', 'exercisers', 'Debra', 'Meg', 'who', 'exercises', 'be', 'performed', 'weights', 'only', 'equipment', 'used', 'mat', 'LIGHT', 'weights', 'most', '3', 'even', 'felt', 'heavy', 'many', 'movements', 'Main', 'Menu', 'options', 'Play', 'All', 'Chapter', 'Selection', 'Greetings', 'Studio', 'workout', 'well-chaptered', 'chapters', 'flow', 'other', 'rather', 'have', 'defined', 'start/end', 'points', 'However', 'will', 'use', 'names', 'appear', 'chapter', 'menu', 'describe', 'segment', 'greater', 'detail', 'times', 'are', 'approximate', '.Warm-Up', '5', 'minutes', 'Ellen', 'gentle', 'breaths', 'arm', 'circles', 'plies', 'warm-up', 'inner', 'thigh', 'stretch.Side', 'Leg', 'Lift', 'Series', '5.5', 'minutes', 'Ellen', 'up', 'weights', 'segment', 'side', 'arm', 'lift', 'palms', 'up/palms', 'down', 'side-to-side', 'leg', 'lifts', 'continuing', 'arm', 'movements', 'move', 'squat', 'circle', 'also', 'butterfly', 'arms', 'wide', 'circling', 'arms', 'doing', 'plies', 'side-to-side', 'whole', 'series', 'time', 'lifting', 'leg', 'rear.Plie', 'Stance', 'Series', '9.5', 'minutes', 'Ellen', 'use', 'weights', 'even', 'more', 'arms', 'work', 'section', 'Standing', 'Pilates', 'stance', 'moves', 'including', 'side', 'reaches', 'shoulder', 'presses', 'big', 'circles', 'plies', 'triceps', 'overhead', 'presses', 'sun', 'arms', 'arm', 'circles', 'chest', 'expander', 'additional', 'butterfly', 'arms', 'legs', 'get', 'just', 'bit', 'work', 'set', 'static', 'lunges', 'side.Pulley', 'Arms', 'Lunge', '9.5', 'minutes', 'name', 'segment', 'first', 'move', 'single', 'leg', 'lunge', 'one-arm', 'pulley', 'move', 'rear', 'Additional', 'moves', 'include', 'whisps', 'body', 'back', 'extensions', 'lasso', 'arms', 'single', 'double', 'arm', 'rows', 'again', 'just', 'bit', 'legs', 'work', 'skater', 'squats.Mat', 'Work', '10.5', 'minutes', 'Ellen', 'here', 'twisting', 'move', 'reclined', 'seated', 'position', 'then', 'lying', 'Pilates-inspired', 'matwork', 'including', 'single', 'leg', 'stretch', 'ballerina', 'criss-cross', 'partial', 'full', 'rollup', 'knee', 'drops', 'progressively', 'adding', 'increased', 'challenge', '.Final', 'Stretch', '5', 'minutes', 'Ellen', 'stretch', 'cobbler', 'pose', 'rocking', 'butterfly', 'move', 'also', 'hip', 'lifts', 'Additional', 'stretches', 'include', 'seated', 'twist', 'cross-legged', 'forward', 'bend', 'brief', 'neck/shoulder', 'stretches', 'finish.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'workout', 'definitely', 'had', 'more', 'upper', 'body', 'emphasis', 'was', 'aware', 'going', 'However', 'found', 'bit', 'difficult', 'find', 'right', 'amount', 'weight', 'use', 'consistently', 'workout', 'started', 'off', '3', 'quickly', 'felt', 'too', 'heavy', 'switched', '2', 'was', 'better', 'found', 'liked', 'doing', 'movements', 'such', 'butterfly', 'arms', 'much', 'better', 'weights', 'So', 'second', 'time', 'did', 'workout', 'tried', 'WITHOUT', 'weights', 'most', 'exercises', 'still', 'used', 'weights', 'tricep', 'work', 'rows', 'found', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'liking', 'got', 'better', 'range', 'motion', 'movements.I', 'am', 'glad', 'discovered', 'Ellen', 'studio', 'series', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVDs']",Slim Sculpt

Ellen has helped transform me from a lazy couch potato who had 1001 excuses to not exercise to someone who looks forward to working out each day (and thanks to Ellen's other DVDs - someone who now has sculpted obliques!!!). I admit I am usually cursing my bad food choices and exercising in general while I am doing any workout, but after finishing Ellen's DVDs I feel accomplished and inspired to do more.Ellen's cueing is always excellent so you know what you're doing next (unlike some Denise Austin DVDs where you have to be psychic to figure out what her next move is - and are constantly rewinding because you missed the changeover to the next move). And Ellen's voice (and personality) is pleasant and not at all grating. Love her personality and nature.Slim Sculpt is similar to Skinny Sculpt in that light hand weights are used for the majority of the workout - this is to help sculpt your arms (my #1 obsession). With both DVDs your arms are up in the air with the weights a lot of the time so do not be a hero and use heavy weights (especially when starting out). With Skinny Sculpt I jumped straight in using weights bad idea as I had the upper body strength of a kitten. I went back to no weights, graduating to weights for part of the workout to being able to use the weights the whole way through. I have had Skinny Sculpt for a while now so I could use weights right away with Slim Sculpt. I love that the moves/workout in Slim Sculpt are different to Skinny Sculpt so with those two and Ellen's newer, Sleek Sculpt Express (and my free weight workouts) I can happily focus on my arms obsession without getting bored!Ellen Barrett's workouts are for those who want to obtain a flexible, sleek, long line feminine physique without getting injured.

1143463,AIYPX432C0P93,B0013KGWBM,Karoly,"[101, 103]","I am a big fan of Ellen Barrett's, and have been for a couple of years.  My favorite routine of her's, up to now, was the one she created for FitTV's ""All Star Workouts"" called Zen Sculpt.  My next favorite, also from ""All Star Workouts"" was her Slow-robics.  This new DVD, ""Slim Sculpt"" is from Ellen's Buff Girl Fitness productions, and is a melding of both of the ""All Star"" routines!  It is a great workout from start to finish, and is very challenging and tough.  It is Ellen at her very best.A little note about Ellen's style...she isn't for those who want a bulky physique.  She is more about elongating and strengthening the muscles for a lean and feminine dancer's body.  Her routines blend Plilates and weight/resistant training, with cardio integration.  The entire program works all areas of the body--the powerhouse, the heart center, and the limbs.  So, you burn calories, build muscle, and stretch through each move smoothly and gracefully.  There is a great warm up, followed by the main body of the routine using light hand weights, which has plenty of her signature plies and ""butterfly"" moves and some balance challenges, with mat work (powerhouse and glutes) and a cool down/stretch at the end.Working out with Ellen is not easy, but it is gentle to the mind/body.  If you want hard-core cardio, with lots of jumping around and kick-boxing, she's not for you.  If you want to look like Cathe Friedrich, Ellen won't get you there.  However, if you want to be toned, flexible, long and lean, she's your gal.  Done on a regular basis, you will see results.If you want to see what this workout is all about, watch Ellen's ""All Star Workout"" segments, then think of a combination of each routine.

But the more important thing is that it makes my shoulders and neck hurt. They don't feel worked out, they just hurt. I did this video one day, and the next day I didKathy Smith: Lift Weights to Lose Weight, and I felt really worked out and with no shoulder pain. This is the second Studio workout I've bought from Ellen Barrett and I didn't like the other one either. I like her old Crunch videos, but the Studio thing just isn't working for me.

I alternate Slim Sculpt with Tracy Anderson's Mat workout when I want variety in my toning days. I also use Jari Love, Voight, Tamilee, etc. when I want to lift heavier than 3 lbs. to strengthen my bones and avoid osteoporosis. But for reshaping/sculpting my body, it's either Ellen or Tracy. I have a long way to go transforming my body to a lean non-bulky look but who says I'm in a race for that....My rotation consists of 4 cardio days-3 Strength/Toning days and I add a 'Power' Stretch routine to 1 cardio day. At 45 years old, I just have to keep at it-meaning exercise daily and eat sensibly [the hardest part for me]. Consistency in exercising got me to avoiding hypertension and diabetes maintenance meds. Back to Slim Sculpt, Ellen's moves may be repetitive but I personally don't mind. There's more upper body work here particularly the shoulders and arms 'cuz you'll feel it the next day and the floorwork emphasized on the core and butt muscles.

Ellen rivals Tracy Anderson's arm toning in this one! Your arms will feel sore after this workout. In a good way! She uses light weights and big ranges of motion but also has a modifier if you would rather do the workout without weights. In my opinion, Ellen hit it out of the park with this one. You probably will feel like dropping your arms at time during this workout but that's a good thing! I love the graceful blend of strengthening and toning that is incorperated into this workout.
