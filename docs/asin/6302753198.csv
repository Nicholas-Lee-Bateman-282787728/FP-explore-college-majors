Many details that the director meant to be seen are now gone.The most important detail that is gone is when Zorba says ""God gave man hands to grab"", and he grabs with his own big hands. But in this DVD version the hands are gone from the bottom of the picture. So the scene looses much of its power since the visual language is gone!!The original idea with widescreen in cinema was to show more picture at the sides. But here you just get less picture at top and bottom, not more at the sides.

331488,A3HBKD6GKPZKC4,6302753198,Bahama Joe,"[3, 3]","This film has a tour de force acting performance by Anthony Quinn in the role of Zorba, a jack of all trades and master of none whose character teaches us that &#34;life is something you do until you die&#34; and therefore it must be lived to the fullest. Alan Bates was a convenient foil for Quinn in the role of the sexually repressed young writer just trying to figure it all out. The other stand out performances were from Lila Kedrova, who won a best supporting actress oscar for her performance as the faded courtesan hotel owner of the &#34;Ritz&#34; while Irene Papas was very effective in her tragic role as the ill fated young widow.This movie itself is tough to love in parts especially in the graphic scenes where tragedy befalls the female protagonists. One has to understand that this film was set on Crete in the early 20th century where sexual and cultural mores  were quite different than today .Still these scenes may be a bit jarring for some when viewed within the prism of the 21st century.From a technical standpoint, I liked this blu ray transfer of this  50 year old B&W; film. The cinematography involving long shots of island landscape and sea scapes were quite clear in this blu ray and I loved the music score.

The faithfulness of the script to Nikos Kazantzakis's novel is impressiveThe score is uplifting. The high-contrast, b/w cinematography is quite beautiful.  While Anthony Quinn occasionally pushes the enveelope with his exuberance, his role is offset by the brooding Alan Bates, whose eloquent performance as a man between life stages, countries, and loves is remarkable. Lila Kedrova's Oscar-winning performance is a specxial treat. The extras  are entertaining, but unnecessary.  I lobbed off a star because my copy began delaminating (the plastic layers detached from the aluminum layer) after just six months.  Two-sided DVDs (like this one) are a drag, not only because they are more difficult to handle without scratching, but because their slightly wider metal layer may stress the polycarbonate wafers around it, eventually causing the DVD  wafer to split.

331490,ACC1SLND21RI6,6302753198,Breyel,"[0, 1]","""Zorba the Greek"" in many ways is similar to Miguel de Cervantes' ""Don Quixote"". Alexis Zorba (Anthony Quinn) like Sancho Panza is the loyal guardian to his rationale, yet repressed Anglo-Greek 'Boss' (Alan Bates). Madame Hortense, the old French consort (Oscar winner Lila Kedrova) whom he proposes marriage is likened to Dulcina. He defends a widow (Irene Papas) when villagers attack her to exact family honour for the suicide of a son and would-be suitor, although she is ultimately murdered. As the movie progresses, we witness Alan Bates' character, Basil, gradually adopting more and more of the loveable rascal's traits, just as Sancho Panza began to emulate Don Quixote's chivalry and quest for adventure.I agree the music and dancing is infectious. The scenery and casting extras on the island of Crete also lend credibility to Zorba's whimsical desire to tame their austerity and harshness, although he doesn't always succeed. Still -- and I can't emphasise this enough -- you cannot help but love this guy's audacity, his craziness to continually scheme and to rise above every adversity, hardship thrown at him. Zorba takes life by the horns and tries to live it on his terms.Zorba's bacchanal lifestyle and outlook may seem overly provocative. Yet, he is certainly the most humane and civilised of characters when compared to the villagers on the island. In this respect, Nikos Kazantzakis, the author of ""Zorba The Greek"", lets it be known we should be less analytical, less dogmatic towards circumstances that befall us in life. Rather, we should learn to be more compassionate towards others; we should discover the beauty of singing and dancing with life...enjoying its pleasures and mysteries as it reveals itself little by little, day after day.Notable features on this 20th Century Fox DVD include:* An alternative (and I might add cheesy) beginning to the film with Anthony Quinn in a toga, resting on a cloud, pretending to be Zeus or God* Stills of Quinn et al arriving in Greece for the filming and the Paris premier of ""Zorba The Greek""* Running commentary from director Michael Cacoyannis synced to the film* A biography on Quinn* Standard chapter, language and subtitle options",5,A quixotic tale,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,2205,"['Zorba', 'Greek', 'many', 'ways', 'similar', 'Miguel', 'de', 'Cervantes', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'Alexis', 'Zorba', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Sancho', 'Panza', 'loyal', 'guardian', 'rationale', 'yet', 'repressed', 'Anglo-Greek', ""'Boss"", 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Madame', 'Hortense', 'old', 'French', 'consort', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Lila', 'Kedrova', 'whom', 'marriage', 'likened', 'Dulcina', 'widow', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'when', 'villagers', 'attack', 'exact', 'family', 'honour', 'suicide', 'son', 'would-be', 'suitor', 'ultimately', 'murdered', 'movie', 'witness', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'character', 'Basil', 'gradually', 'adopting', 'more', 'more', 'loveable', 'rascal', 'traits', 'just', 'Sancho', 'Panza', 'began', 'emulate', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'chivalry', 'quest', 'adventure.I', 'agree', 'music', 'dancing', 'infectious', 'scenery', 'casting', 'extras', 'island', 'Crete', 'also', 'lend', 'credibility', 'Zorba', 'whimsical', 'desire', 'tame', 'austerity', 'harshness', ""n't"", 'always', 'succeed', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'emphasise', 'enough', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'love', 'guy', 'audacity', 'craziness', 'continually', 'scheme', 'rise', 'adversity', 'hardship', 'thrown', 'Zorba', 'life', 'horns', 'tries', 'live', 'terms.Zorba', 'bacchanal', 'lifestyle', 'outlook', 'may', 'seem', 'overly', 'provocative', 'certainly', 'most', 'humane', 'civilised', 'characters', 'when', 'compared', 'villagers', 'island', 'respect', 'Nikos', 'Kazantzakis', 'author', 'Zorba', 'Greek', 'be', 'known', 'should', 'be', 'less', 'analytical', 'less', 'dogmatic', 'towards', 'circumstances', 'befall', 'life', 'Rather', 'should', 'learn', 'be', 'more', 'compassionate', 'towards', 'others', 'should', 'discover', 'beauty', 'singing', 'dancing', 'life', 'enjoying', 'pleasures', 'mysteries', 'little', 'little', 'day', 'day.Notable', 'features', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'DVD', 'include', '*', 'alternative', 'might', 'add', 'cheesy', 'beginning', 'film', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'toga', 'resting', 'cloud', 'pretending', 'be', 'Zeus', 'God*', 'Stills', 'Quinn', 'et', 'al', 'arriving', 'Greece', 'filming', 'Paris', 'premier', 'Zorba', 'Greek', '*', 'Running', 'commentary', 'director', 'Michael', 'Cacoyannis', 'synced', 'film*', 'A', 'biography', 'Quinn*', 'Standard', 'chapter', 'language', 'subtitle', 'options']",Zorba the Greek VHS

Erland,"[8, 9]","The rain beats down on a dark, dreary Greek harbor town as a young, well educated English writer (Alan Bates) climbs about a weathered freighter sailing for Crete. Basil (Bates) is making his first voyage to his ancestoral home, he has inherited some property and a mine that he hopes to re-open.Shortly after boarding Basil is approached by an enigmatic, grizzled looking Greek named Zorba (Anthony Quinn). With intense, flashing eyes and the intimidating smile of a madman Zorba looks into the face of the bewildered Englishman and boldly states, ""I like you, take me with you."" Surprisingly Basil agrees, thus beginning a most unconventional friendship and a journey of self-discovery the likes of which has seldom be captured on film.From the first sighting of Zorba peeking through the rain drenched window on the ship you become distinctly aware of the presence of a unique and magical personality.  A personality embodying the soul and wisdom of the ages. Priest, confessor, shaman, guru, enlightened master, friend and follow traveller. Reminiscent of the Greek God Pan, Zorba laughs, sings and dances through all the joys and tragedies of life viewing everything as a necessary part of the process of living. As Zorba tells his young friend and pupil, ""Life is trouble, only death is not.""Zorba works his magic from beginning to end and will enchant the viewer long after he leaves us dancing with Basil on the barren sandy beaches of Crete against the backdrop of the beautiful Mediterranean.Adapted from the novel of the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis and released in '64 'Zorba the Greek' truly captures the existential landscape of the 20th century and Anthony Quinn and Alan Bates deliver the performances of a lifetime. Add to the mixture the stark but inviting scenery of the island of Crete and an intoxicating soundtrack of traditional Greek music and you have one of the greatest motion pictures of all-time.

331492,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,6302753198,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[69, 77]","Something is definitely wrong with this picture!! Where is Criterion, or some other company that is neglecting one of the greatest movies of the 20th C?Cacoyannis assembled one of the most sublime international casts ever in this classic. Few movies can approach great literature as far as providing a microcosm of &quot;the human condtition,&quot; to use an overworked, but apt phrase. This is one of the few that can. The plot, which is secondary to the theme, revolves around the wizened, but still vibrant Greek peasant Zorba (Quinn) teaching the young, uptight, sexually confused (OK, maybe that's not PC of me, but it's certainly the subtext) Brit mine-owner &quot;boss&quot; Basil (Alan Bates), about the facts of life.Zorba is one of the great lovable rogues of cinema history, maybe even the most memorable. Wine, women, song and dance are his credo, and we come to learn that they are his defense against some personal tragedy in his background. This film is unmatched in terms of playing the comic against the tragic, the many facets of life that color actual existence, as opposed to the usual Hollywood, one dimensional perspectives. There are layers within layers to the message here, just as in great fiction or theater. What it boils down to, however, is about friendship. Zorba and Basil go through so much together, running the full gamut of human emotions, that by the perfectly realized ending (the best I can recall in recent or distant memory, outside of Fellini's La Strada maybe [another Quinn movie, incidentally]), this viewer was breaking down in sheer joy/release/catharsis. The Greeks have long had a knack for this, have you noticed?As a footnote, the soundtrack is also legendary, thanks to Greece's most noted score composer, Mikis Theadorakis. I'm not going to gripe here, but how did Alan Bates pass on without an Oscar on his mantle? This was essentially Cacoyannis' and Quinn's project, however, and they should live on in every film buff's memory for ages to come for this masterpiece on both their parts. Irene Papas, as a widow who shoots some of the most unforgettable darting glances in film history, and Lila Kedrova as the sad, but ever hopeful Madame Hortense, are also highly memorable. And where did Cacoyannis find those old, withered, diminuitive, toothless harpies that hung about the bedside like vultures gathering for a feast?Do what you can to re-view this true classic on VHS while we hope and pray that the eventual DVD treatment will be of worthy quality.BEK",5,No DVD?,1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,2514,"['Something', 'definitely', 'wrong', 'picture', 'Where', 'Criterion', 'other', 'company', 'neglecting', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', '20th', 'C', 'Cacoyannis', 'assembled', 'one', 'most', 'sublime', 'international', 'casts', 'ever', 'classic', 'Few', 'movies', 'can', 'approach', 'great', 'literature', 'as', 'far', 'providing', 'microcosm', 'quot', 'human', 'condtition', 'quot', 'use', 'overworked', 'apt', 'phrase', 'one', 'few', 'can', 'plot', 'secondary', 'theme', 'wizened', 'still', 'vibrant', 'Greek', 'peasant', 'Zorba', 'Quinn', 'teaching', 'young', 'uptight', 'sexually', 'confused', 'OK', 'maybe', 'not', 'PC', 'certainly', 'subtext', 'Brit', 'mine-owner', 'quot', 'quot', 'Basil', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'facts', 'life.Zorba', 'one', 'great', 'lovable', 'rogues', 'cinema', 'history', 'maybe', 'even', 'most', 'memorable', 'Wine', 'women', 'song', 'dance', 'are', 'credo', 'come', 'learn', 'are', 'defense', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'background', 'film', 'unmatched', 'terms', 'playing', 'comic', 'tragic', 'many', 'facets', 'life', 'color', 'actual', 'existence', 'opposed', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'dimensional', 'perspectives', 'are', 'layers', 'layers', 'message', 'here', 'just', 'great', 'fiction', 'theater', 'What', 'down', 'however', 'friendship', 'Zorba', 'Basil', 'go', 'so', 'much', 'together', 'running', 'full', 'gamut', 'human', 'emotions', 'perfectly', 'realized', 'ending', 'best', 'can', 'recall', 'recent', 'distant', 'memory', 'Fellini', 'La', 'Strada', 'maybe', 'Quinn', 'movie', 'incidentally', ']', 'viewer', 'was', 'breaking', 'down', 'sheer', 'joy/release/catharsis', 'Greeks', 'have', 'long', 'had', 'knack', 'have', 'noticed', 'footnote', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'legendary', 'thanks', 'Greece', 'most', 'noted', 'score', 'composer', 'Mikis', 'Theadorakis', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'gripe', 'here', 'how', 'did', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'pass', 'Oscar', 'mantle', 'was', 'essentially', 'Cacoyannis', 'Quinn', 'project', 'however', 'should', 'live', 'film', 'buff', 'memory', 'ages', 'come', 'masterpiece', 'parts', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'widow', 'who', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'darting', 'glances', 'film', 'history', 'Lila', 'Kedrova', 'sad', 'ever', 'hopeful', 'Madame', 'Hortense', 'are', 'also', 'highly', 'memorable', 'where', 'did', 'Cacoyannis', 'find', 'old', 'withered', 'diminuitive', 'toothless', 'harpies', 'hung', 'bedside', 'vultures', 'gathering', 'feast', 'Do', 'what', 'can', 're-view', 'true', 'classic', 'VHS', 'hope', 'pray', 'eventual', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'will', 'be', 'worthy', 'quality.BEK']",Zorba the Greek VHS
331493,AN9J46667D80O,6302753198,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[4, 7]","I'd heard many great things about the film ""Zorba the Greek"". Now I've watched it. What do I think?""Zorba the Greek"" is based on a novel by the same name. It tells the story of an Englishman (Alan Bates), who comes to Greece to open up a mine left to him by his father. Along the way he meets the exciting and interesting Alexander Zorba (Anthony Quinn). Zorba talks the Englishman into giving him a job. As the movie goes on, our Englishman falls in love, learns about life, and how to do Greek dances. About what you'd expect for a movie like this.As for my opinions of it? Well, first, Zorba is kind of useless, isn't he? I mean, sure he has his whole ""lust for life"" thing going on, but when it really matters, what does he do? Nothing. When someone is killed, he does nothing (also, no real explanation for WHY this particular person was killed). When a rather odd plan he formulates goes down the tubes, he does nothing to correct it. He's big, he's loud, he's romantic, he's useless.But on the other hand, Anthony Quinn's performance as Zorba is amazing! He really carries the film and elevates the material above what it would otherwise be. Bates does reasonably well, as does Lila Kerdova, who plays a Frenchwoman ""of a certain age"", and got an Oscar for her performance.The scenery is nice, though I'm somewhat surprised they didn't film this movie in color. Since it was filmed in Greece, you do get a good feel for the people and the place.But overall? I was disappointed. The movie wasn't nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. The DVD is pretty good, boasting a commentary and an episode of ""Biography"" on Anthony Quinn. The extras, plus Quinn's performance, may make the movie worth owning to some.

They cross paths on Crete, and there the story unfolds.  The stars of this film are many: the excellent adaptation by Cacoyannis; the hard-to-forget music by Mikis Theodorakis (available, thank goodness, on CD); Crete as backdrop to the story; the Academy Award-winning black and white cinematography, black and white art direction/set decoration; and, Quinn, Bates, Irene Papas and Lila Kedrova (Best Supporting Actress winner), all superb in their roles.  At nearly two-and-a-half hours, the film holds your attention because of all the aforementioned ingredients. I had the pleasure of seeing Quinn and Kedrova on stage in the musical adaptation (Zorba) that toured for a while in the 80's, and while I enjoyed it a lot, I couldn't help but think of how musical the film was in all regards, and how the addition of Broadway-style tunes pulled focus from the simple power of the story, which was so effectively captured by Cacoyannis and his cast. If I had to run out of a burning building with only a small bagfull of films, Zorba the Greek would surely be one of them.

Not existing, but LIVING.Anthony Quinn created a vibrant, lovable personality that leaps off the screen in every scene, and he rules the movie as its trickster god. Though ""Zorba"" reminds viewers that life can be unfair and bitter, it can also be full of joy, love, fun and simple pleasures. It's hard not to have some happy tears when this film finally ends.Stuffy, prissy, uptight Basil (Alan Bates) is journeying to Crete to take care of his inheritance, some land and mines. On the way, he meets the scruffy, earthy Alexis Zorba (Anthony Quinn), who volunteers to be Basil's all-round sidekick (""I like you... take me with you!""). Basil can't exactly say no, especially since he is as different as can be from the native Cretans. In fact, he sticks out like a sore thumb all the time.But Zorba has more than music and soup to offer. His gusto for life is all about women, wine and general joie de vivre, but he also hides secret pains in his past. And he introduces Basil to a beautiful, tragic young widow, an aging prostitute with a sad past, and the beauties of Crete itself. With Zorba to guide him, Basil finds out how to really live.The setting is the stark, primal beauty of Crete -- lots of dusty, stony roads, mountains full of gnarly trees and cruelly beautiful landscapes. It's reflected in the heartless behavior that small communities sometimes have (such as the poor widow), but it's also a backdrop against which the simple pleasures of life (through Zorba) can shine the brightest.Director/writer Michael Cacoyannis got two Oscar nominations for this movie, and it's not hard to see why. He made the dialogue quirky in a realistic way (""What kind of man are you? Don't you even like DOLPHINS?""), and let the story unfold in a natural, sometimes bittersweet way. The only problem is the way in which all the main women in the story end up.Zorba is one of those really magical movie characters -- he laughs, drinks, weeps, dances, and worries about his crazy brain. He's an impish figure like a trickster god with no real harm in him. Even a collapsing mine shaft can't keep him down -- he just walks out and curses the mountain (""I'll eat your guts!""). Alan Bates is the ideal counterpart, as a repressed, bookish little Englishmen who starts to realize that propriety is overrated.""Life is trouble. Only death is not,"" sums up ""Zorba the Greek,"" an enchanting look at how to enjoy your life. It's a memorable, lovable little movie, and a deserving classic.",5,"A man needs a little madness, or else... he never dares cut the rope and be free",1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,2591,"['Zorba', 'Greek', 'one', 'magical', 'bittersweet', 'movies', 'what', 'living', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'about', 'Not', 'existing', 'LIVING.Anthony', 'Quinn', 'created', 'vibrant', 'lovable', 'personality', 'screen', 'scene', 'rules', 'movie', 'trickster', 'god', 'Zorba', 'viewers', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'unfair', 'bitter', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'full', 'joy', 'love', 'fun', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'hard', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'tears', 'when', 'film', 'finally', 'ends.Stuffy', 'prissy', 'uptight', 'Basil', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'journeying', 'Crete', 'take', 'care', 'inheritance', 'land', 'mines', 'way', 'scruffy', 'earthy', 'Alexis', 'Zorba', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'who', 'be', 'Basil', 'all-round', 'sidekick', 'like', 'take', 'Basil', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'say', 'no', 'especially', 'as', 'different', 'can', 'be', 'native', 'Cretans', 'fact', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'time.But', 'Zorba', 'more', 'music', 'soup', 'offer', 'gusto', 'life', 'women', 'wine', 'general', 'joie', 'vivre', 'also', 'secret', 'pains', 'past', 'Basil', 'beautiful', 'tragic', 'young', 'widow', 'aging', 'prostitute', 'sad', 'past', 'beauties', 'Crete', 'Zorba', 'guide', 'Basil', 'out', 'how', 'really', 'live.The', 'setting', 'stark', 'primal', 'beauty', 'Crete', 'lots', 'dusty', 'stony', 'roads', 'full', 'gnarly', 'trees', 'cruelly', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'reflected', 'heartless', 'behavior', 'small', 'communities', 'sometimes', 'have', 'such', 'poor', 'widow', 'also', 'backdrop', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'life', 'Zorba', 'can', 'shine', 'brightest.Director/writer', 'Michael', 'Cacoyannis', 'got', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'movie', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'made', 'dialogue', 'quirky', 'realistic', 'way', 'What', 'kind', 'man', 'are', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'DOLPHINS', 'let', 'story', 'unfold', 'natural', 'sometimes', 'bittersweet', 'way', 'only', 'problem', 'way', 'main', 'women', 'story', 'end', 'up.Zorba', 'one', 'really', 'magical', 'movie', 'characters', 'drinks', 'weeps', 'dances', 'worries', 'crazy', 'brain', 'impish', 'figure', 'trickster', 'god', 'real', 'harm', 'Even', 'collapsing', 'mine', 'shaft', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'down', 'just', 'walks', 'out', 'mountain', ""'ll"", 'eat', 'guts', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'ideal', 'counterpart', 'repressed', 'bookish', 'little', 'Englishmen', 'who', 'realize', 'propriety', 'overrated', 'Life', 'trouble', 'Only', 'death', 'not', 'Zorba', 'Greek', 'enchanting', 'look', 'how', 'enjoy', 'life', 'memorable', 'lovable', 'little', 'movie', 'deserving', 'classic']",Zorba the Greek VHS
331501,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,6302753198,Ernest Jagger,"[3, 3]","""Zorba the Greek"" is one of the first of the great films I remember watching as a young boy. Even as far back as 1964, there was a magical appeal to the film for me. And now that I am much older, I appreciate the film even more. I never tire of viewing Zorba, and the director, Michael Cacoyannis did an excellent job not only with the character development of Zorba (Anthony Quinn) but Alan Bates as well.Moreover, the stunning and beautiful cinematography enhances the films appeal. And the decision to use black and white instead of color was a great decision. For some reason, the black and white gives the film something [I am not quite sure what] of an added and luring sense that color could never have given the film. Seeing Alan Bates' portrayal as the bookish and uptight Englishman sent to inherit his fathers mine, contrasted brilliantly with the 'Full of Life' and wisened character of Zorba.The entire film is a lesson in life. A lesson at least for a young man (Bates) who comes to see the zest which Zorba exhuberates [even in the most difficult times] as a much needed respite from his own uptight and rigid belief's. The film works at every level, and it is the greatest [to me anyway] film or both Bates and Quinn's career. They are both gone now, however, they remain on the screen forever. And who can forget the ending, with the wonderfully scripted words of Zorba to Bates: ""Boss, of all the men I have ever known, I have loved you the most.""

Bernabo,"[50, 55]","Since I am leaving today for a trip to Greece I figured I should watch &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; since this 1964 film is considered the quintessential &quot;Greek&quot; film.  I have to admit my first reaction was to be glad I was not going to Crete, because the way the locals treated the beautiful widow (Irene Papas) and Madame Hortense (Lila Kedrova), the old prostitute, were outright horrific.  But this is why people like us and young Basil (Alan Bates) need to meet up with somebody with a zest for life like Alexis Zorba (Anthony Quinn).Basil is an Englishman of Greek extraction who goes to Crete to check out a mine he has inherited.  Zorba attaches himself to Basil, ostensibly as a cook but clearly as a guide to the joys and tragedies of life.  In terms of Quinn's performance the only thing you can really say is that before there was Robert Begnigni there was Zorba the Greek when it comes to Mediterranean men who provided inspirational madness.  As Zorba tells Basil: &quot;Dammit, boss, I like you too much not to say it.  You've got everything except one thing.  Madness!  A man needs a little madness, or else...he never dares cut the rope and be free.&quot;  +When they arrive on Crete it becomes clear the mine is not going to pan out for anybody.  They move in with Madame Hortense, who is wooed by Zorba, who insists Basil go after the beautiful local widow.  After these tragedies all that is left is Zorba's plan for bringing trees down from the top of the mountain, an endeavor obviously equally doomed to failure.  This is why in the end there is only one thing a man can do, and it is in this cathartic conclusion that any and all sins of this film are absolved.&quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; is written and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, based on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis.  The film won three Academy Awards: Lila Kedrova for Best Supporting Actress, Best Art/Set Direction, and Best Cinematography.  Quinn did not win the Oscar for what is clearly his most memorable role in a long and distinguished film career, but that is usually the case with actors and their greatest roles.  Marlon Brando did not win for Stanley Kowalski and Quinn did not win for Alexis Zorba.

331515,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,6302753198,lily t.,"[3, 3]","I read some of the other reviews, which summarize the plot. I'll merely add that the movie takes place in rural Crete in the 1930's, where life was harsh, and there was a double standard for men and women. However, the character portrayed by Alan Bates isn't just a repressed British intellectual, he has actively focused his spiritual life inward, while writing a book about the Buddha and contemplating the void --he doesn't want to engage in life. This is reflective of Kazantakis' own spiritual struggles, which were marked alternatively by asceticism and earthiness. Zorba brings Bates' character back to the world--though he finds his time on Crete brutal and marked by tragedy, particularly because of the death of the young, beautiful widow, and the old,tragic,deluded,yet ultimately delightful, Madame Hortense.To me the relationship between Bates and Irene Pappas contains some of the most incredibly erotic moments in cinema. The two are smitten from the first moment they lay eyes on each other, and yet because of her position in the village as a respectable widow,  his awareness of that fact, and his self-imposed reticence--they don't engage. Passing each other on a lonely road--all the sexual tension between them- everything that has gone unsaid and undone-- is more profound than the thousands of images of bumping and grinding that Hollywood has subjected us to. When he finally comes to her house in the dead of night, the emotions that pass over her before she gives herself to him: her desire, her shame, her joy the moment she realizes he will be a tender, giving lover are terribly moving, beautiful and sensual.Irene Pappas is gorgeous in this role--so much pride, pain, longing and strength. When she is so brutally killed, not just for her sexual transgression but for her pride and independence in choosing a stranger for her lover--a slap in face to the 'honor' of the villagers who all lusted after her, Bates is unable to act, and is thrown back into his doubt and his own void. Zorba brings him back from that. Yes, life is brutal, humans are horrid, petty, jealous and stupid [ all over the globe, to this day]  but life is also beautiful--and for now, it's all we've got.",5,some clarification,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,2207,"['read', 'other', 'reviews', 'summarize', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'merely', 'add', 'movie', 'place', 'rural', 'Crete', '1930', 'where', 'life', 'was', 'harsh', 'there', 'was', 'double', 'standard', 'men', 'women', 'However', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Alan', 'Bates', ""n't"", 'just', 'repressed', 'British', 'intellectual', 'actively', 'focused', 'spiritual', 'life', 'inward', 'writing', 'book', 'Buddha', 'contemplating', 'void', ""n't"", 'want', 'engage', 'life', 'reflective', 'Kazantakis', 'own', 'spiritual', 'struggles', 'were', 'marked', 'alternatively', 'asceticism', 'earthiness', 'Zorba', 'Bates', 'character', 'back', 'world', 'time', 'Crete', 'brutal', 'marked', 'tragedy', 'particularly', 'death', 'young', 'beautiful', 'widow', 'old', 'tragic', 'deluded', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'delightful', 'Madame', 'Hortense.To', 'relationship', 'Bates', 'Irene', 'Pappas', 'most', 'incredibly', 'erotic', 'moments', 'cinema', 'two', 'are', 'smitten', 'first', 'moment', 'lay', 'eyes', 'other', 'yet', 'position', 'village', 'respectable', 'widow', 'awareness', 'fact', 'self-imposed', 'reticence', 'do', ""n't"", 'engage', 'Passing', 'other', 'lonely', 'road', 'sexual', 'tension', 'them-', 'everything', 'gone', 'unsaid', 'undone', 'more', 'profound', 'thousands', 'images', 'bumping', 'grinding', 'Hollywood', 'subjected', 'When', 'finally', 'house', 'dead', 'night', 'emotions', 'pass', 'desire', 'shame', 'joy', 'moment', 'will', 'be', 'tender', 'giving', 'lover', 'are', 'terribly', 'moving', 'beautiful', 'sensual.Irene', 'Pappas', 'gorgeous', 'role', 'so', 'much', 'pride', 'pain', 'longing', 'strength', 'When', 'so', 'brutally', 'killed', 'not', 'just', 'sexual', 'transgression', 'pride', 'independence', 'choosing', 'stranger', 'lover', 'slap', 'face', ""'honor"", 'villagers', 'who', 'lusted', 'Bates', 'unable', 'act', 'thrown', 'back', 'doubt', 'own', 'void', 'Zorba', 'back', 'Yes', 'life', 'brutal', 'humans', 'are', 'horrid', 'petty', 'jealous', 'stupid', '[', 'globe', 'day', ']', 'life', 'also', 'beautiful', 'now', ""'ve"", 'got']",Zorba the Greek VHS

He's brings the ultimate joy of living to the role, in which he shows a reserved Englishman what the essence of life is all about.  &quot;You have to be a little mad,&quot; he says, and he surely demonstrates this.  He works hard, he loves women, he constantly philosophizes about life and he dances.  I immediately loved the character and wanted to identify with him.  There is beauty is what he says and passion in every one of his actions.Lila Kedrova is also great in a supporting role that won her an Academy Award.  She plays an aging French woman who runs the hotel in Crete where Quinn and the Englishman, played by Alan Bates, go to work a mine that Bates has inherited.  She is sad, funny and flirtatious all at the same time, and my heart went out to her plight.  Quinn romances her and I could understand the relationship between these two people who both live their lives to the fullest.The film has a message.  And that is to find joy in life. It's a good message and that's why this film is a classic.However, I can't understand why it was filmed in black and white.  If ever a film needed color, this one did.  And even though Irene Pappas is given star billing, her time on the screen, as the widow who appeals to the Englishman, is very little.  I found her performance rather wooden as I did the performance of Bates.  But, after all, that was the role Bates was cast in.  Pappas should have been stronger.I was disturbed by the basic story, which depicted some terrible cruelty by the townspeople.  And the Englishman's role of just standing by and doing nothing, even though he was the cause of much of it, was disappointing.  Bates' expression mostly stayed the same throughout it all, that of being overwhelmed.  And his face showed no acknowledgment of the horror.I still recommend this film however - if only to see Quinn at this best.

I was so young, 18 or so, I didn't quite understand it but it had a powerful emotional impact. A few years later I read the novel and loved it so much that I then read it twice a year for about 10 years, then once a year after that (so I've read it about 30 times). My opinion of the movie dropped during the reading years because the movie only got about a third of the magic of the novel. Later I watched the film again and fell into love with it, a profound work in its own right. Film doesn't have all the fascinating detail and stories of the novel but does capture the LIFE, the struggle, the wonderful character of Zorba and many of the secondary characters. The movie is so much superior to most Hollywood movies, so character driven, so thoughtful, spiritual and deep as to make it hard to 'get into' right away. I would guess that young people today would have a really hard time enjoying it because it is antithetical to MySpace iPod cell phone culture, ie the ""culture"" of no-thought, music video, shallowness. It would be most interesting to screen Zorba for a group of 50 or 100 young college students and high school students and then survey their reactions. I would like to think that the simple power and Truth of Zorba would make a deep impression on them but I don't know. All I know is that Zorba (who was a real man that author Kazantzakis met and lived with for some 6 months) should have lived a thousand years, just as Zorba said, and I'd hope that there is still some real hunger for meaning in people that would make them fall in love in Zorba the movie and Zorba the novel.",5,"tragedy, comedy, the hilarious sad business of life.",1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,1647,"['first', 'saw', 'Zorba', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1962', 'was', 'so', 'young', '18', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'had', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'impact', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'read', 'novel', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'then', 'read', 'twice', 'year', '10', 'years', 'then', 'once', 'year', 'so', ""'ve"", 'read', '30', 'times', 'opinion', 'movie', 'dropped', 'reading', 'years', 'movie', 'only', 'got', 'third', 'magic', 'novel', 'Later', 'watched', 'film', 'again', 'fell', 'love', 'profound', 'work', 'own', 'right', 'Film', ""n't"", 'have', 'fascinating', 'detail', 'stories', 'novel', 'capture', 'LIFE', 'struggle', 'wonderful', 'character', 'Zorba', 'many', 'secondary', 'characters', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'superior', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'so', 'character', 'driven', 'so', 'thoughtful', 'spiritual', 'deep', 'make', 'hard', ""'get"", 'right', 'away', 'would', 'guess', 'young', 'people', 'today', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'hard', 'time', 'enjoying', 'antithetical', 'MySpace', 'iPod', 'cell', 'phone', 'culture', 'ie', 'culture', 'no-thought', 'music', 'video', 'shallowness', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'screen', 'Zorba', 'group', '50', '100', 'young', 'college', 'students', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'then', 'survey', 'reactions', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'simple', 'power', 'Truth', 'Zorba', 'would', 'make', 'deep', 'impression', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'know', 'Zorba', 'who', 'was', 'real', 'man', 'Kazantzakis', 'met', 'lived', '6', 'months', 'should', 'have', 'lived', 'thousand', 'years', 'just', 'Zorba', 'said', ""'d"", 'hope', 'still', 'real', 'hunger', 'meaning', 'people', 'would', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'Zorba', 'movie', 'Zorba', 'novel']",Zorba the Greek VHS

When timid English writer, Basil (Alan Bates) hires the enigmatic, fiery and lustful Zorba (Anthony Quinn) to work a mine he's inherited in Crete, a clash of cultural differences arises. Basil despises Zorba's fast and loose way with women but admires his work ethic and protective nature toward a widow who becomes the target of a group of jealous men whose advances the widow has thwarted.  Based on the best selling novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, the film's screenplay and direction belong to Michael Cacoyannis who excels at capturing the flavor and passion of the Grecian masses. Through Zorba's example Basil comes to understand his own shortcomings in life and ultimately grows to engage the world around him. The addictive mandolin soundtrack became an instant best selling record of its day.Part of Fox's Studio Series, ""Zorba the Greek"" has been impeccably mastered for DVD.

Digital anomalies are practically nonexistent and the overall quality of the image is very smooth and easy on the eyes. The soundtrack has been cleaned up and remixed to stereo.

Anyone  who was enthralled with the  film should try and get hold of the book (available in French and English) or if able to read Greek the original version as inevitably some things get lost in translation. The film has a few minor  flaws (as opposed to goofs) which  may not be apparent. For example,  careful viewers  who watch the scene on the ship when Zorba rants against Alan Bates over a dolphin is incomprehensible unless one has read the book. There must have been some bad editing  of the  script or the footage and essential lines needed for the  interaction to make sense are missing.Many people, even Greeks I know, are convinced that the story's Zorba was a Cretan. Not so, the book makes it very plain that he was a miner from Makedonia (not to be confused with the former Yugoslav republic of the same name) who in his own words was born under the heights of Mount Olympus, Greece's  highest  peak. Many  viewers, and some of the Amazon reviewers, wince at the violence  and the crude manners of the Cretan peasants as depicted in the film. The setting of the book, however, is in the late 1920s. The old  French courtesan refers to events that happened in Crete during its revolution against Ottoman rule many years  before  the setting of the film. Zorba, the Makedonian,  claims that he played a combative  role in that revolution.Zorbas's straight man  in the film is played by a young Alan Bates as a person of mixed British-Greek parentage who inherits a mine. In the book  the role is played by the narrator, a writer, who is purely Greek  and who would have little trouble in a Cretan setting except that he is a college-trained intellectual,  one who is gradually won over by Zorbas's natural philosophy. The actual Greek title of the novel ""Vios kai Politeia tou Alexi Zorba"" , which  cannot  be satisfactorily translated, conveys this.  He does not inherit the mine, he rents it to occupy himself and get over the loss of his best frend killed in some remote war with the Turks near the Black Sea. The screen adapatation was right to omit the complex reasons for his trip to Crete which unecessarily interrupt the book's first chapter that really begins, as in the film, in a Piraeus quayside cafe during a storm.The awful violence associated with the film's act of revenge, and  the separate scenes  of  the looting of a dying woman's house would be more credible  back in the 1920s but  very unlikely to have occured some  eighty years later. However, even today, a film director would have little problem in finding toothless crones in black  for extras in any Greek village. Greek peasants are not very careful about their teeth and women often crack nuts with their jaws.",5,Toothless Crones Cracked Nuts When Young,1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,3430,"['film', 'one', 'time', 'classics', 'should', 'be', 'never', 'remade', 'particularly', 'never', 'colour', 'foreign', 'actors', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'unconvincing', 'Greek', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Zorba', 'film', 'succeeded', 'most', 'roles', 'were', 'played', 'well-known', 'Greek', 'movie', 'actors', 'early', '1960s', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'foreign', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'successfully', 'imitate', 'Greek', 'character', 'black', 'white', 'format', 'essential', 'black', 'comedy/drama', 'aspects', 'movie', 'novel', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'difficult', 'adapt', 'screen', 'yet', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'well-handled.I', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'London', 'theatre', 'bought', 'LP', 'sound', 'track', 'as', 'soon', 'became', 'available', 'Anyone', 'who', 'was', 'enthralled', 'film', 'should', 'try', 'get', 'hold', 'book', 'available', 'French', 'English', 'able', 'read', 'Greek', 'original', 'version', 'inevitably', 'things', 'get', 'lost', 'translation', 'film', 'few', 'minor', 'flaws', 'opposed', 'goofs', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'apparent', 'example', 'careful', 'viewers', 'who', 'watch', 'scene', 'ship', 'when', 'Zorba', 'rants', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'dolphin', 'incomprehensible', 'one', 'read', 'book', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'editing', 'script', 'footage', 'essential', 'lines', 'needed', 'interaction', 'make', 'sense', 'are', 'missing.Many', 'people', 'even', 'Greeks', 'know', 'are', 'convinced', 'story', 'Zorba', 'was', 'Cretan', 'Not', 'so', 'book', 'very', 'plain', 'was', 'miner', 'Makedonia', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'former', 'Yugoslav', 'republic', 'same', 'name', 'who', 'own', 'words', 'was', 'born', 'heights', 'Mount', 'Olympus', 'Greece', 'highest', 'peak', 'Many', 'viewers', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'wince', 'violence', 'crude', 'manners', 'Cretan', 'peasants', 'depicted', 'film', 'setting', 'book', 'however', 'late', '1920s', 'old', 'French', 'courtesan', 'refers', 'events', 'happened', 'Crete', 'revolution', 'Ottoman', 'rule', 'many', 'years', 'setting', 'film', 'Zorba', 'Makedonian', 'played', 'combative', 'role', 'revolution.Zorbas', 'straight', 'man', 'film', 'played', 'young', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'person', 'mixed', 'British-Greek', 'parentage', 'who', 'mine', 'book', 'role', 'played', 'narrator', 'writer', 'who', 'purely', 'Greek', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'little', 'trouble', 'Cretan', 'setting', 'college-trained', 'intellectual', 'one', 'who', 'gradually', 'won', 'over', 'Zorbas', 'natural', 'philosophy', 'actual', 'Greek', 'title', 'novel', 'Vios', 'kai', 'Politeia', 'tou', 'Alexi', 'Zorba', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'satisfactorily', 'translated', 'conveys', 'not', 'inherit', 'mine', 'occupy', 'get', 'loss', 'best', 'frend', 'killed', 'remote', 'war', 'Turks', 'Black', 'Sea', 'screen', 'adapatation', 'was', 'right', 'omit', 'complex', 'reasons', 'trip', 'Crete', 'unecessarily', 'book', 'first', 'chapter', 'really', 'film', 'Piraeus', 'quayside', 'cafe', 'storm.The', 'awful', 'violence', 'associated', 'film', 'act', 'revenge', 'separate', 'scenes', 'looting', 'dying', 'woman', 'house', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'credible', 'back', '1920s', 'very', 'unlikely', 'have', 'occured', 'eighty', 'years', 'later', 'However', 'even', 'today', 'film', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'little', 'problem', 'finding', 'toothless', 'crones', 'black', 'extras', 'Greek', 'village', 'Greek', 'peasants', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'careful', 'teeth', 'women', 'often', 'crack', 'nuts', 'jaws']",Zorba the Greek VHS

This is  Great Greek  music! I cannot read the book except that I hear this score. I also hear Anthony Quinn (Zorba) as I read, so second point in favor.If you only have modern eyes and ears, it is not possible to miss the misogyny. A woman is murdered by lynch mob. The victim knows that her killing is the way of her village even if she could not articulate why.  The portrayal of peasants is pretty much clich&eacute; and overtly negative. Even the effete and timorous academic Brit (Alan Bates) however brilliantly acted is 60+ years later clich&eacute;. On the other hand this is a world where if there is a school you can bet there is prayer in school and all of these villagers considered themselves to be very good deeply religious people. No one here has civil rights and no one has the money to even think about filing a lawsuit. So this really is the mythical past isn't it?If you can watch as if looking into a window in time, it is a classic.The central character Zorba is a con, a failure a womanizing drunk. And for all this he is Alive. He carries the wisdom of a long and varied, and mostly a failed life, but all of his scars are in front. That is he never turned his back. The key to Zorba is that he is every bit as small as the timid ""Boss"" Basil. The difference is Zorba does not admit to it. For Zorba to be alive is to be thirsty. Not being in trouble is to be going through the motions.  Ultimately Zorba is the classic con and lovable ne'er-do-well.Yes this movie is black and white and yes it is paced pretty much as movies were paced 60+ years ago but if you can place yourself in that time it is an authentic pleasure.

I was very impressed with the direction and the movie's very faithful rendition of the original novel. What really makes this a fine film is the exuberant performance of Anthony Quinn in the title role. If ever an actor was born to play a specific part this was it. Quinn has the character's joy of life and he plays Zorba as if he was possessed. This was clearly the role of a lifetime for him and he was never better. Alan Bates does a fine job as the Englishman who takes Zorba with him to Crete and is gradually transformed by Zorba's zest for living.The scenery is stunning even though it's in B&W;, the raw beauty of the island comes through. Even the opening scenes in the port of Piraeus with the pouring rain are realistic and well done.I loved the film , although there are two things that made me deduct 1 star. First the film starts and finishes very strong but there are a few scenes in the middle that drag a bit. Second the villagers are depicted as harsh and cruel without really much characterization. They come across as stereotypes and cardboard cutouts at times.

331532,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,6302753198,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 2]","This is a beautiful and extremely raw film about an impoverished Crete, from the point of view of a sensitive literary man and his charge, the irrepressible Zorba.  I saw this when very young with my father; his point was that it is about learning to dance to the miracle of life, but for me it sparked a fascination with Europe, at once so similar yet so different.It starts with a charming local (Quinn) hussling the unworldly writer, Bates.  This is a character that Quinn plays to perfect pitch, funny and full of life yet aggressive in his pursuit of his mark.  He accompanies him to Crete, where the writer inherited some land, including a decrepit mine that he wants to reanimate.  Zorba introduces him to the subtleties of village life in what is one of the most charming and believable portrayals of the virtues of ancient tradition.  I was swept into it as a child and now as an adult, though having lived in Europe for decades I am far more jaded than I was.  The landscape is dotted with the most vivid characters, from naive, wine-loving priests and rapacious villagers to pathetic spinsters or coveted widows.  It is poignant without Hollywood sentimentality.The underside quickly reveals itself, in particular with a brutal murder as public retribution, which is both unjust and displays the helplessness of the protagonists.  It is tragedy of a type that AMericans would find hard to understand.  The writer watches with the deep regret of a new lover.  Another awful scene is the looting of a woman's house while she is on her death bed, a lonely creature whom Zorba befriended out of sympathy.But the main plot line is Zorba as he teaches the writer about life.  Their relationship, with all its frustrations, is fresh and completely believable, an original literary gem.  The writer learns to laugh, to approach others for love, and to dance.

'Zorba' is a testament to the great actor and personality, Anthony Quinn.  He fills the screen with his spirit. Zorba does his own thing, lives life to its fullest on his own terms but, even so he is neither small nor selfish.  His compassion is boundless.At the same time, having never been there, I rather suspect that the director/producers of this fine film have shortchanged the people of Crete.  The scene in which the French woman lays dying, surrounded by crones in the form of human vultures almost literally waiting to pick her bones, is both distressing and chilling.  Also, the scene in which the villagers slaughter the widow woman in a strange form of honor killing is also disturbing.  Hopefully, this is a gross mischaracterization of the people of the island.The last scene in which Zorba and his young boss dance and laugh following the destruction of their mine and dreams is very similar to John Huston's great 'Treasure of Sierra Madre' in which two men, following the loss of all their gold fall into uncontrollable hysterical laughter.

Indeed, the film originally began with Anthony Quinn playing Zeus (or at least Zeus as Zorba sees him) in a deliberately theatrically artificial heaven in a prologue that can be found in the extras on the US DVD and Blu-ray editions (but not the less fortunate Region 2 PAL editions).It certainly paints a less than flattering portrait of Cretan village life. One Sunday the villagers leave the church to harry and then kill a woman they blame for a suicide, and when ex-prostitute Lila Kedrova lies dying they cannot even wait for her to stop breathing to loot her hotel. Functioning like some leaderless medieval fiefdom in thrall to machismo and misogyny, it is as far from a good commercial for the Cretan tourist Board as you can imagine.Similarly, Anthony Quinn's performance in the title role is more layered than its many parodies over the years would lead you to expect. A loser with a gift for life who inveigles his sway into working for Alan Bates' excellently underplayed half-English observer of life who has come to make a go of his father's mine, there's a genuine sense of laughter in the face of death and despair in his performance. More low-key than you would expect, it is all perfectly underlined by Mikos Theodorakis' surprisingly varied and versatile score and Walter Lassally's Oscar-winning cinematography.Fox's region-free US Blu-ray carries over all the extras from their two-sided US DVD release, and it's an impressive bunch: audio commentary by director Michael Cacoyannis and Nikos Katzanzakis expert Demetrios Liappas, the alternate opening sequence, documentary Anthony Quinn - A Lust for Life, 2 Movietone News extracts, stills gallery, TV spot; teaser trailer and full trailer (they're not all listed on the packaging but are all present and correct on the disc itself).",5,"""Life is trouble.
