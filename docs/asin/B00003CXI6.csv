I figured, with a cast this good, how bad can it be? The answer? REALLY REALLY BAD. &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; follows just about every cookie cutter scary movie rule that I can think of. From the ever popular &quot;oh is that a ghost!? ;SCREAM; Oh! It's you Sparky, thank goodness&quot; scene to the over used &quot;Writing in the steam on the bathroom mirror&quot; trick. This movie was so predictable, I was ready to walk out a half hour before the movie was over without any fear that I would miss anything. It was a struggle to stay for the entire thing without standing up and leaving, or at the very least cracking up with laughter at how bad this movie is. From the very beginning it tries too hard to be a scary movie. Watching the neighbor crying through the fence in the middle of the day does NOT deserve suspenseful music. There are lots of popular horror movies out there. They all have something going for them, something different that makes them special. &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; just doesn't. It doesn't have the humor of &quot;Scream&quot;, it doesn't have the camp value of the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; series, it doesn't have the teen appeal of &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, it doesn't have the pure suspense of the &quot;Alien&quot; series, and it doesn't have the surprise ending of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. If you like predictable make-you-jump scary movies, this could be the one for you. If you're like me and you like something with a little originality, you're better off leaving this one alone.",1,Cookie Cutter Scary Movie,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,1650,"['So', 'girlfriend', 'convinced', 'take', 'see', 'quot', 'What', 'Beneath', 'quot', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'figured', 'cast', 'good', 'how', 'bad', 'can', 'be', 'answer', 'REALLY', 'REALLY', 'BAD', 'quot', 'What', 'Beneath', 'quot', 'just', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'scary', 'movie', 'rule', 'can', 'think', 'ever', 'popular', 'quot', 'ghost', 'SCREAM', 'Oh', 'Sparky', 'thank', 'goodness', 'quot', 'scene', 'over', 'used', 'quot', 'Writing', 'steam', 'bathroom', 'mirror', 'quot', 'trick', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'predictable', 'was', 'ready', 'walk', 'out', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'fear', 'would', 'miss', 'anything', 'was', 'struggle', 'stay', 'entire', 'thing', 'standing', 'up', 'leaving', 'very', 'least', 'cracking', 'up', 'laughter', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'very', 'beginning', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'scary', 'movie', 'Watching', 'neighbor', 'crying', 'fence', 'middle', 'day', 'NOT', 'deserve', 'suspenseful', 'music', 'are', 'lots', 'popular', 'horror', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'have', 'something', 'going', 'something', 'different', 'special', 'quot', 'What', 'Beneath', 'quot', 'just', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'have', 'humor', 'quot', 'Scream', 'quot', ""n't"", 'have', 'camp', 'value', 'quot', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'quot', 'series', ""n't"", 'have', 'teen', 'appeal', 'quot', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'quot', ""n't"", 'have', 'pure', 'suspense', 'quot', 'Alien', 'quot', 'series', ""n't"", 'have', 'surprise', 'ending', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'like', 'predictable', 'make-you-jump', 'scary', 'movies', 'could', 'be', 'one', ""'re"", 'something', 'little', 'originality', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'leaving', 'one', 'alone']",What Lies Beneath VHS
526095,A1TSYN528AXVMA,B00003CXI6,A Customer,"[0, 1]","Scream was so famous because of it's use of comedy and horror. This movie has decided to mix drama with horror and it doesn't work....at all. Its soooooooo drug out and boring that when something truly scary happens, it scares the crap out of you! The drama in The Sixth Sense was so enjoyable because of the great script and the terrific cast. The cast in this is nothing short of terrific too, but its the script that makes the movie so slow. The characters aren't interesting at all. They are extremely ordinary and and just lifeless. They are only likable because you know going into the film that they are your main characters and you have to like them. They do nothing or say nothing to make you like them. Michelle Pfeiffer's character is scared through out the whole movie - even at the beginning - for no reason. First the neighbor scares her, then the ghost scares her, then she's scaring herself! It seems like she walks around this movie trying to be scared. She seems to have no hobby or no life. The reason I gave this movie four stars is because it is well acted, there is a great mystery (even though it passes by sooooo slowly) and the ending is nothing but a shocking twist that leaves your mouth hanging open for about a half an hour (being the horror movie lover that I am, I did guess what was going on before it was revealed). There are some really good scares, probably because it is slow then the scares come fast, but at least it does it's job. And the setting is quite eerie. What Lies Beneath is good and is definitely worth watching....just know that its slow and does drag for sometime.",4,"Scary as hell, yet suprisingly boring",986256000,"04 3, 2001",2001,1615,"['Scream', 'was', 'so', 'famous', 'use', 'comedy', 'horror', 'movie', 'decided', 'mix', 'drama', 'horror', ""n't"", 'work', 'soooooooo', 'drug', 'boring', 'when', 'something', 'truly', 'scary', 'happens', 'crap', 'drama', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'script', 'terrific', 'cast', 'cast', 'nothing', 'short', 'terrific', 'too', 'script', 'movie', 'so', 'slow', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'are', 'extremely', 'ordinary', 'just', 'lifeless', 'are', 'only', 'likable', 'know', 'going', 'film', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'like', 'do', 'nothing', 'say', 'nothing', 'make', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'character', 'scared', 'whole', 'movie', 'even', 'beginning', 'reason', 'First', 'neighbor', 'then', 'ghost', 'then', 'scaring', 'movie', 'trying', 'be', 'scared', 'have', 'hobby', 'life', 'reason', 'gave', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'well', 'acted', 'great', 'mystery', 'even', 'sooooo', 'slowly', 'ending', 'nothing', 'shocking', 'twist', 'mouth', 'hanging', 'open', 'half', 'hour', 'being', 'horror', 'movie', 'am', 'did', 'guess', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'revealed', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'scares', 'probably', 'slow', 'then', 'scares', 'come', 'fast', 'least', 'job', 'setting', 'quite', 'eerie', 'What', 'Beneath', 'good', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', '.just', 'know', 'slow', 'drag', 'sometime']",What Lies Beneath VHS

It's directed by Robert Zemeckis, who did the movies Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the Back to the Future trilogy--by no means the greatest films ever made, but good movies. And you have Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer playing the leads--two great actors. I'm not sure if they've starred in a movie together yet, but if not, it is about time. And Pfeiffer does a good job, Ford does a good job. What is great is that you don't often see Ford in this type of role (I won't spoil it for you). But neither does the level of work that they are capable of and normally do. It's an interesting story, though one that has been done a few times. Like Minority Report, it has all the ingrediants of being a great film, but it just falls short. I don't know what it is (maybe it was Zemeckis was focused on Cast Away, he made what lies beneath in between filming Cast Away- while Hanks was losing all that weight- and wasn't focused on this film). There are two interesting facets to the film, one is some interesting camera moves: long takes, glass floors, etc; the other are the homages to Hitchcock (Rear Window and Psycho). I'd watch it, but don't expect this to be the best thing you've seen. The dvd is ok. There is a commentary by the director and a behind-the-scenes featurette. But once again, nothing spectacular.

526103,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXI6,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","`What Lies Beneath' certainly has it's fair share of thrills, and there are moments when you will jump near out of your skin, but in the end the film is almost too campy for it's own good.That said; it's still worth checking out.The film tells the story of Caitlin Spencer, a woman drove halfway to insane by paranoia when she begins to speculate that her new neighbors are harboring a dark secret.  When she starts having visions, in particular that of a young dead woman, she becomes increasingly more agitated by the idea that a ghost needs to communicate some horrendous truth to her.It's kind of like `Gothika', just not as bad.It's a very good thing that Michelle Pfeiffer chews this film up.  She just attacks this performance with so much dedication and fearlessness that you almost forgive her for giving way to this choppy (and at times rather silly) script.  She's actually very close to fabulous here.  Shockingly, the acting all the way around is pretty great.  Even Harrison Ford, an actor who is very hit or miss (more often miss) for me.  He carries the eerie sense of destructive charm that suits his character flawlessly.  I also thought that Diana Scarwid was rather great here as well, serving up your typical token `best friend' role with a twist.I only wish that this film didn't wear its influences on its sleeves.  The film borrows so heavily from other, more successful films of this nature, and it's blatantly obvious.  When you look at a film like `The Sixth Sense' (one of many that this film borrows from), you can see how they used originality to their advantage to create something that will break boundaries.This film doesn't do that.The film kind of escalates to a rather chaotic and unsuccessful ending, but there are moments throughout that balance things off, helping `What Lies Beneath' become recommended viewing.  This is far from the best in the genre, but it's also far from the worst (I give it a C+. verging on a B-).  It's fun and spooky, and even when it reaches levels of ridiculous camp (such as that laughable possession scene), the film is redeemed by committed acting that never fails to sell the unsellable.",3,"It's not haunting, but it's spooky, campy fun...",1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,2158,"['What', 'Beneath', 'certainly', 'fair', 'share', 'thrills', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'will', 'jump', 'skin', 'end', 'film', 'almost', 'too', 'campy', 'own', 'good.That', 'said', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.The', 'film', 'story', 'Caitlin', 'Spencer', 'woman', 'drove', 'halfway', 'insane', 'paranoia', 'when', 'speculate', 'new', 'neighbors', 'are', 'harboring', 'dark', 'secret', 'When', 'having', 'visions', 'particular', 'young', 'dead', 'woman', 'increasingly', 'more', 'agitated', 'idea', 'ghost', 'communicate', 'horrendous', 'truth', 'her.It', 'kind', 'like', 'Gothika', 'just', 'not', 'bad.It', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'film', 'up', 'just', 'performance', 'so', 'much', 'dedication', 'fearlessness', 'almost', 'forgive', 'giving', 'way', 'choppy', 'times', 'rather', 'silly', 'script', 'actually', 'very', 'close', 'fabulous', 'here', 'Shockingly', 'acting', 'way', 'pretty', 'great', 'Even', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'actor', 'who', 'very', 'hit', 'miss', 'more', 'often', 'miss', 'eerie', 'sense', 'destructive', 'charm', 'suits', 'character', 'flawlessly', 'also', 'thought', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'was', 'rather', 'great', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'serving', 'up', 'typical', 'token', 'best', 'friend', 'role', 'twist.I', 'only', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'wear', 'influences', 'sleeves', 'film', 'so', 'heavily', 'other', 'more', 'successful', 'films', 'nature', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'When', 'look', 'film', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'one', 'many', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'used', 'originality', 'advantage', 'create', 'something', 'will', 'break', 'boundaries.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'that.The', 'film', 'kind', 'escalates', 'rather', 'chaotic', 'unsuccessful', 'ending', 'are', 'moments', 'balance', 'things', 'off', 'helping', 'What', 'Beneath', 'become', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'far', 'best', 'genre', 'also', 'far', 'worst', 'give', 'C+', 'verging', 'B-', 'fun', 'spooky', 'even', 'when', 'levels', 'ridiculous', 'camp', 'such', 'laughable', 'possession', 'scene', 'film', 'redeemed', 'committed', 'acting', 'never', 'sell', 'unsellable']",What Lies Beneath VHS
526104,A2O7MOWVMSKO5J,B00003CXI6,Andy Gill,"[0, 0]","To call What Lies Beneath Hollywood&#65533;s most self-conscious tribute to Alfred Hitchcock is by no means an understatement. Elements of, amongst scores of others, Rear Window, Rope, Notorious, North by Northwest, Vertigo and, of course, Psycho, combine in terms of plot and visuals to make a thoroughly absorbing story that is as classic in its narrative as its masterful cinematic style. Everything about this film harks back to the 40&#65533;s and 50&#65533;s way of doing things, whilst simultaneously using advanced technology to take that style and project it into the present day. Indeed, every single shot feels like Zemeckis said to himself: how would Hitchcock have filmed this? What would he have done if he had the technology we have? With more than a few allusions to the old master himself (grabbing the shower-curtain when falling out of the bath, for example), the result, understandably, is stunning.With so much going on in every scene, it is difficult to talk concisely about this film. Throughout, there is much to marvel over in the cinematography, editing, soundtrack; the chills come thick and heavy, the mystery sucks you in, the visual brilliance astounds at every turn. The claustrophobia of the house, the realism of Ford and Pfeiffer&#65533;s relationship and the intrigues that surround the central characters pale into insignificance beside the pure ingenuity of the filmmaking. In a single take, Pfeiffer leaves the bathroom, the bath empty, walks around for a minute, and re-enters the same bathroom, now filled with steam, the bath full, before discovering a message written on the mirror. In the final sequence, the camera darts in and out of CGI cars, offering shots that Hitchcock could only dream about, and yet the whole set-piece screams of 50&#65533;s classicism. In the creepiest bathroom sequence since Psycho, we are offered the POV of a drowning woman, in a scene that deserves to go down in film history as one of the best-constructed examples of film technique ever seen. In some scenes, the camera even drops suddenly through the floor, to look up through glass at the actors above. For fans of film aesthetics, there is no doubting that this is one of the finest experiments to grace the screens.Admittedly, if you are not a fan of Hitchcock or have never seen a Hitchcock, much of the enjoyment can be taken out of the film. The story plods along at first, only really picking up momentum half-way through. However, that said, the final half-hour more than makes up for any lack of pace in the early reels. If nothing else, it is great to see Ford in a role that is the opposite of what we have come to expect from him.

This film has been compared to Hitchcocks films.

Why? Hitchcock movies are intelligent, winding around the story and characters. ""What Lies Beneath"" uses spooky music and scenes that jump out and calls it disturbing.""Ghostbusters"" is scarier.What is disturbing is Harrison Ford's choice to be involved. What was he thinking when he signed on? He's a favorite actor for me. He's starred in ""Star Wars,"" ""Indiana Jones,"" ""The Fugitive"" and ""Mosquito Coast."" Good stuff. Until this.Ford's credibility as an actor is not shaken. He carries each scene of this meandering movie. Bad plotlines are confused as tricky storytelling, and even Ford can't take a Saturday-matinee and turn it into a Friday-night blockbuster.Does the movie adequately refer to Hitchcock classics? Who cares? That sort of thing is only interesting when the referring movie succeeds on its own. This doesn't. That's the same problem Ang Lee had when making ""The Hulk."" He spent so much time of mimicking a style that he forgot to make a good movie.The Plot:Happy couple lives in Vermont. The wife is being spooked but does not know why. The husband does not seem to understand. The ghost slowly reveals its intentions, and the happy couple's life unravels. The big finish is not expected, and the only redeeming part of this 130 minute couch-sit.About the story:Connections are never made as to why the ghost waits a year to do some haunting, and why it took the measures involved. Nor, why it thinks Claire ""knows"" why she's being haunted when she fully demonstrates she has no idea.The ghost tries to kill Norman, Ford's character. If that's all it wants, why does it need Claire, Michelle Pfeiffer's character and Norman's wife?Subplots involving the quirky neighbors are never sorted out.""What Lies Beneath"" as a title is misleading. I can't go into this more for the sake of ruining the story for those of you who will wind up still seeing it.In all, the movie will be forgotten, played late at night in the time slot reserved for exercise equipment commercials. The movie is not awful, and better than a rerun of that infomercial with Chuck Norris. It is just that Harrison Ford, and costar Michelle Pfeiffer can and have done better.Looking for a real thriller? See the Hitchcock movies that this is being compared.

One thing about this movie that makes it scary is the sound and distinct noises.  So if you didn't see it in theaters or if you don't have a great sound system, then I feel you are getting cheated out of a cheap thrill.  Like most other suspense/horror/thriller movies, most of the scares come from sounds thrown at you.  And this holds VERY true for this movie.  Without hearing all the sounds, you'll only come out thinking this being a mediocre movie.  When you can hear the simple whisperings that seem to come through the air, that's when I feel you would get your money's worth.  All in all the movie was great, but I recommend before owning this dvd, invest in a better sound system.  Look into something with Dolby Digital 5.1 AND DTS encoders.

Michelle Pfeiffer shines in this film. This is really her baby. Harrison Ford is as good as usual, but is given the backseat in the first part. He comes into his own in the last half.

526113,A1OUEDUZ4AHVIZ,B00003CXI6,"Ben Stubbs ""Horror / Metal Enthusiast""","[0, 0]","""What Lies Beneath"" will always be remembered as Robert Zemeckis' homage to Alfred Hitchcock. From the opening credits to the stunning climax, the techniques of the master are unashamedly paid tribute to. The music, the camerawork, the building up of suspense, the characters names etc. are all straight from numerous classic Hitchcock films such as ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"" and ""Psycho"". But while it may seem quite stupid to try to copy such a brilliant director's work (the ""Psycho"" remake comes to mind), Zemeckis has surprisingly created a great film here.Clair and Norman appear to be a happily married couple. They clearly have money, a beautiful house and a daughter heading towards her own successful career. But when Claire suspects her neighbour of murdering his wife, her world suddenly begins to crumble around her. Not only is she constantly spying on the suspicious activities next door, but she also becomes aware of a presence within her own house. While those around her (Norman included) believe her to be losing her sanity, Claire searches deeper for answers which inevitably leads her to repressed memories that, with the help of beautiful girl long dead, lead her to a shocking revelation that sends her marriage and mental state into turmoil.When reading the above plot, you may feel that this is nothing new. There have been countless movies over the years with ghosts attempting to communicate with the living to reveal the cause of their demise. In fact, there are plenty of clich&eacute; moments in ""What Lies Beneath"". But the film is so beautifully and lovingly made that it is thoroughly entertaining nonetheless. Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford are both fantastic and completely convincing throughout. Pfeiffer in particular has a tough role to get through here, having to be both extremely vulnerable and steamily sexual at various times. She is always beautiful, but at the age of 42, she is simply stunning and captivating as Clair. But it's Zemeckis' direction that stands out as exceptional. The film is quite long at 2 hours, but this running time is used to build up the intensity. What starts out as reasonably cheap scares, turn into genuinely frightening ones by the second hour. There are some great set pieces (the bath scene in particular is a classic) and CGI is seamlessly utilized throughout, particularly as a tool for camera trickery.I know this film has its detractors and I can honestly understand the qualms that they raise. But a good film is a good film in my book, regardless of its origin or blatant worshipping status. ""What Lies Beneath"" gave me exactly what I wanted with some great scares, masses of suspense and intrigue, topped off with fantastic visuals, sound, acting and direction.

526120,ABLWGDPUOSEXR,B00003CXI6,Bradford Wilson,"[44, 50]","In a time in which good horror/suspense movies are few and far between, Robert Zemeckis brings us a wonderfully and surprisingly taut and well-balanced thriller filmed in the grand tradition of the great Alfred Hitchcock.  Finally, a horror movie that doesn't rely on fake blood and cheesy special effects to wow the crowd, or attempt to scare the feeble minded.  The movie is centered around a couple, recently moved, who has discovered a supernatural presence in their new dwelling.  The wife, Claire (played beautifully by Michelle Pfeiffer, in one of the best female performances of the year) believes it to be the ghost of the neighbor she suspects has been murdered.  The husband, Norman (played well by Harrison Ford) of course, thinks she is crazy.  The movie twists and turns around this basic central plot, leading to an ending that, although not terrible, I'm still not quite buying.  The greatness of the movie comes not from the plot, but from the style in which the film was created.  Some of the devices are a bit overused (a door opens mysteriously about three times too many), but not too much as to distract the viewer.  There are some great scenes that, although clich&eacute;d, (there's a wonderful scene that borrows heavily from Rear Window) work beautifully and really instill a sense of apprehension in the viewer.  Also, Zemeckis utilizes silence to build suspense where a lesser director might use the old disonant-music-crescendos-into-a-big-loud-scare tactic that we see all too often in horror movies. Somewhere along the way, the line between horror movies and slasher films has blurred.  It seems now that if you want to scare people, all you need is some fake blood and a knife.

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[1, 1]","Expecting the incomparable Harrison Ford to play another hero or good guy, one of this film's many stunners is that he isn't. But that revelation comes after we get clued in that the ghost haunting Ford's and wife Michelle Pfeiffer's house isn't the one of the neighbor thought to have been done in by her husband. And the third is Pfeiffer's understated but strong performance as the wife who slowly regains her memory lost a year earlier in a car crash, and how her recall puts her face-to-face with the watery death her husband has planned for her, much like the one he gave the ghost that haunts their house. Director Robert Zemeckis gives us Ford and Pfeiffer as married couple Norman and Claire Spencer, and what lies beneath is the fearful reality of what exists on the surface is, in this case, the polarity of reality. A la Hitchcock, the film takes us from the jitters of wife Claire's gradual awakening to reality, then to learning the true identity of the ghost in her midst (yes, there is a real ghost!) and, finally, how finding out puts everything in her life on the line. It's the last third of the film that is the most gripping, however, as Claire manages to tap into a reservoir of fight and sheer will (along with a little help from the ghost that turns out to be her salvation) and take on her psychotic husband in a fight to the fatal finale. Seeing Ford as a bad guy is something of an unsettling experience, but he ably adds another dimension to his tremendous acting ability. Pfeiffer is, as she usually is, magnificent, and we can't help but feel her bond to the spirit of her husband's murdered lover in the film's final frame. And as Claire's best friend, Diana Scarwid provides some refreshing light comedy in trying to help her friend make contact with the other side. All in all, ""What Lies Beneath"" is an entertaining ghost story and, though certainly not a message film, it serves to remind us that the real ghosts of our private hauntings are ususally the ones of our own making.",4,A haunting by the unpeaceful dead,1048291200,"03 22, 2003",2003,2013,"['Expecting', 'incomparable', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'play', 'hero', 'good', 'guy', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'stunners', ""n't"", 'revelation', 'get', 'clued', 'ghost', 'haunting', 'Ford', 'wife', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'house', ""n't"", 'one', 'neighbor', 'thought', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'husband', 'third', 'Pfeiffer', 'understated', 'strong', 'performance', 'wife', 'who', 'slowly', 'memory', 'lost', 'year', 'earlier', 'car', 'crash', 'how', 'recall', 'face-to-face', 'watery', 'death', 'husband', 'planned', 'much', 'one', 'gave', 'ghost', 'house', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Ford', 'Pfeiffer', 'married', 'couple', 'Norman', 'Claire', 'Spencer', 'what', 'beneath', 'fearful', 'reality', 'what', 'surface', 'case', 'polarity', 'reality', 'la', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'jitters', 'wife', 'Claire', 'gradual', 'awakening', 'reality', 'then', 'learning', 'true', 'identity', 'ghost', 'midst', 'yes', 'real', 'ghost', 'finally', 'how', 'finding', 'out', 'puts', 'everything', 'life', 'line', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'most', 'gripping', 'however', 'Claire', 'tap', 'reservoir', 'fight', 'sheer', 'will', 'little', 'help', 'ghost', 'out', 'be', 'salvation', 'take', 'psychotic', 'husband', 'fight', 'fatal', 'finale', 'Seeing', 'Ford', 'bad', 'guy', 'something', 'unsettling', 'experience', 'ably', 'dimension', 'tremendous', 'acting', 'ability', 'Pfeiffer', 'usually', 'magnificent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'bond', 'spirit', 'husband', 'murdered', 'lover', 'film', 'final', 'frame', 'Claire', 'best', 'friend', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'refreshing', 'light', 'comedy', 'trying', 'help', 'friend', 'make', 'contact', 'other', 'side', 'What', 'Beneath', 'entertaining', 'ghost', 'story', 'though', 'certainly', 'not', 'message', 'film', 'remind', 'real', 'ghosts', 'private', 'hauntings', 'are', 'ususally', 'ones', 'own', 'making']",What Lies Beneath VHS

526136,A9PNK48FUH27B,B00003CXI6,Cliff Rives,"[1, 1]","Considering Robert Zemeckis gave the world one of the first deluxe DVDs, 1997's Contact, it's startling to note how lackluster the What Lies Beneath DVD materials are. The movie itself is a stylish thriller, confident enough to take its sweet time setting up the payoffs in the last act. Much has been made about how the trailers for theatrical release gave away far too much about the plot, so I won't make the same mistake here. Suffice it to say, Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford play a married couple dealing with empty-nest syndrome, some strange new neighbors, and some spooky goings on hitting much closer to home. The film is deliberately designed to evoke Hitchcock, from its plot points, to its characterizations, to specific shots and settings. By the time Alan Silvestri's score goes into full Herrmann mode and the camera swoops from the stratosphere to the interior of a moving car, this movie could be a film-school drinking game. And of course, the essential letterboxing is preserved on DVD, with a choice of Dolby or DTS sound presentation. The disappointment on this DVD comes from its extra features, which are more &quot;bogus&quot; than &quot;bonus&quot;. First, there's a dry-as-dust commentary by Zemeckis and producer Steve Starkey, whose most revealing insight about the cast is that Michelle Pfeiffer dislikes the rain. There are a few fairly interesting bits about the construction of the house, but that's about as technical as the commentary ever gets. The film has an astonishing shot that begins above a woman lying on a floor, then goes under the floor to look up at her from below. Want to know how they did it? Zemeckis won't tell. In fact, he specifically says, &quot;We'll never tell how we did that shot.&quot; The brief making-of featurette (which originally ran on HBO) features some teasing glimpses of some of the green-screen technology used, but that's all you get. Take that, film students. (Zemeckis went to the USC film school; maybe he just doesn't want anyone learning for free what he had to pay tuition for.) Zemeckis should've followed the example of the Matrix DVD, which allowed viewers to see extensive footage of the effects sequences. So the movie, on its own, is well worth a look, especially for fans of classic thrillers.

526137,ALVJW5NXDBSDO,B00003CXI6,C. Park,"[3, 4]","Maybe I have been spoiled by too many classic thrillers, but this one was a disappointment. While many of the classics, Hitchcock included, mired itself in unbelievable psychological scenarios, at least they had a good excuse- they simply didn't know any better at the time, and were good fun besides. But Harrison Ford's turn from loving husband to (SPOILER ALERT!) vengeful psycho hellbent on covering up the evidence of a former crime seemed nothing more than a gotcha-plot device that did not, for me, achieve its intended effect, and fell even flatter due to the lack of psychological believability. Granted, there were some spooky moments, but they were done with such a heavy hand that only one scene had me at the edge of my seat- hardly enough to qualify as a successful thriller. I especially hate it when a film tries to come off as some sort of classy Hitchcockian tour-de-force (read: no gore) and then falls flat on its face. You can't just pin the Great Alfred's name onto something and expect the audience to forget what that name entails. All the twists and turns in this one just stink of an overzealous and overworked scriptwriter who was simply trying too hard. For a far better experience (including the creepy bathtub) try out Clouzot's ""Diaboliques""- for, as is so often the case with today's films, you will have to travel back in time for some first rate frights. In this case, ""what lies beneath"" is simply poo.However, it was great to see Diana Scarwid in something- she really is quite underused and really should have been given more to work with.

A terrible, terrible pile of cliche-filled nonsense, that's what. &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; is a predictable and not in the least bit scary mess, in fact, it plays more like a silly housewife-detective story rather than a ghost story. (-Seriously, Woody Allen's &quot;Another Woman&quot; is scarier, and it's not even supposed to be.) Like with so many other movies nowadays, it struck me while watching it that it's put together almost like an opera with its exaggerated music (in this case, to remind you it's a thriller), and the loud sound effects (to make you jump.) Sometimes silence works better, and this movie would've won a little bit by having less music. In fact, there are a couple of silent scenes toward the end of the movie, and even though these scenes are constructed pretty much like the earlier scare-scenes in the film, they work better because of the silence. (-And no doubt the reason so many people seem to think they have just been watching the greatest genre movie of all time !.) Little else work in this movie, though. I was expecting a frightful tale about a family living in a haunted house haunted by apparitions and voices, instead I found myself haunted by voices telling me what a foolish idea it had been choosing to spend 2 hours in the dramatic company of Pfeiffer's hysterical housewife and Ford's dull husband. The film-makers were clearly trying to avoid making an oldfashioned haunted house horror film, but it would've been so much better had they gone for just that. Ghost movies either work or they don't. I used to think they were fairly easy to make, but nothing could be further from the truth. Doors opening or closing by themselves isn't always enough, you know. If you haven't created a suspenseful atmosphere pretty early on, leading into  (preferably) an eerie skincrawling one, forget it. This is where this movie and its straightforward narrative fails. I'm sure everyone involved in this project, including Zemeckis, are all nice people (judging by the interviews and smiling snapshots in the DVD's cast&amp;crew section), but they need to stay far away from this type of film in the future. Long takes and slow cutting are such rare and sorely missed things these days, and if for nothing else, at least this movie is &quot;watchable&quot; in those departments. However, at 130 minutes it's just too long, and none of its two &quot;superstars&quot; are very interesting actors or good enough to carry such a long film on their shoulders, especially when so little is happening. With (almost) no other actors present, their limitations become only all too obvious. Especially the tremendously overrated Ford, whose forte remains happy-go-lucky characters like Han Solo and Indiana Jones. And the usually wonderful Remar is completely wasted in a nothing-part. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; didn't succeed on all levels either, but at least it didn't disappoint you.

That was the question I kept asking myself after exiting Robert Zemeckis' latest film, What Lies Beneath. The supernatural thriller stars Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer as Norman and Claire Spencer, a successful and seemingly happy middle-aged couple whose only daughter (Katharine Towne) has just gone off to college. However, their perfect little life together doesn't last long as a result of Claire's changing mental state.The question of Claire's sanity first comes into play early on in the film as a result of Claire's obsession of spying on her new next-door neighbors, Warren & Mary Feur (Rear Window anyone?). Based on what she has seen, or rather what she thinks she has seen and the seeming disappearance of Mary, Claire begins to suspect that Warren has murdered his wife. Claire's suspicions are then taken to a new level as strange occurrences begin to happen throughout the house, ranging from doors that open on their own to the mysterious nature of the family's bathroom, which marks the location of Claire's first vision of a mysterious woman, in one of the film's more memorable scenes. Claire is nearly convinced that Mary has come back from the dead, but at the same time still aware of the possibility that it may all just be in her head. As the visions continue Claire drifts further and further away from her former self, while the relationship between her and her husband does the same. Eventually, Claire can no longer take it and must find out the truth for herself.And then the film takes its first major twist, which I won't give away but was already all but revealed in the film's trailer. The first twist is a good one and really gets the film into gear, ultimately leading to another of the film's more memorable scenes in which we see Claire seducing Norman in a manner that is very un-Claire like given her personality. The scene also includes my favorite shot in the film, which again for spoiler reasons I won't give away (pay attention to Claire's eyes in the scene and you can't miss it) and marks the beginning of the film's next major twist. And it was with this next major twist that the film first begins to fall flat. The film could have gone a number of ways given its psychological and supernatural elements, but instead plays it safe and follows the same old thriller path that we have all grown accustomed too, which just doesn't fit with the flow of the first 2/3 of the film and is extremely disappointing given some of the possibilities that the film's first major twist hint to and could have led to. Despite the lackluster third act Zemeckis, Pfeiffer and Ford are able to pull it off reasonably well given what they have to work with as the final bathroom scenes is another of the film's best. But instead of ending it there Zemeckis can't resist himself, as an additional 15 minutes or so of film full of plenty of ""jump"" scenes follows. This period of the film is absolutely mind boggling to me, not only because it continued to remind me of how lackluster the film's third act really was, but also because the film's end result is basically the same as the result of the bathtub scene, only much, much less effective.It's a shame too, as I really did enjoy the first 2/3 of What Lies Beneath. The film is full of very interesting shots throughout, and through the use of its score in association with some of those shots (especially anything focusing on either a mirror or water) was able to produce some genuine terror and suspense especially once the foreshadowing of these scenes has become apparent. Michelle Pfeiffer is very good in her role as Claire, as she pulls off being either scared and or unstable whenever her part called for it without ever appearing over the top. Unfortunately I can't really say the same for Ford, as the script just doesn't give him enough to work with, something that I feel weakens the film's ending even further given the path it does take.The unnecessary extension of the film, which also happened to be the only problem I had with Zemeckis' Oscar Winning film, Forrest Gump, in addition to the obvious Hitchcock visual and plot references to Psycho, Vertigo and the previously mentioned Rear Window that are laced throughout the film, and the excess and foreshadowing of ""jump"" scenes are a pretty good indication that Zemeckis was really playing around with both the thriller genre and the audience at the same time. While I enjoyed that to a certain extent, it eventually becomes tiresome, as there was just too much of it by the end of the film and because of it the film itself ultimately suffers here as well. If you're a fan of the genre itself I still recommend this film, as despite its downfalls, I still found it in parts to be more terrifying than most other so called thrillers released as of late. What Lies Beneath isn't a bad film; it isn't a very good film either, but at the same time based on its first two acts alone had the makings of being a great film. If only it had ended 15 minutes sooner and if only had it taken a chance.** 1/2 (6.5/10)",3,A Subpar Delivery From Zemeckis,1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,5130,"['How', 'can', 'something', 'was',

526142,A3KOVFORKXQ2U9,B00003CXI6,Daniel McInnis,"[1, 2]","When I first saw What Lies Beneath in mid-July I didn't think too much of it.  It was fairly entertaining but the &quot;twist ending&quot; that all the actors were so tight-lipped about when making the late night talk show rounds wound up being a disappointment to me.  But now I've seen the movie four times in the last month alone (since it's release on DVD) and I've come to appreciate that knowing the outcome is half the fun.  It's really more of a distraction when you know a twist is on the horizon and are constantly looking for it.  Instead I suggest you allow the suspense to build at it's slow, deliberate pace without losing patience or concerning yourself with the outcome because the payoff makes it well worthwhile.Michelle Pfeiffer (who only seems to become more beautiful with age) stars as Claire Spencer, a former musician and wife to a renowned scientist.  His name is Norman (the first of many Hitchcock references), and after being offered a very prestigious position at his late father's school he uproots the family and moves them all to Vermont.  Claire in turn dedicates herself to being the perfect trophy wife, and mother to her daughter from a previous marriage, Catlin.  But when Caitlin moves away to college she's left with nothing but free time on her hands, triggering an empty nest episode of sorts.  She begins watching her neighbor, suspecting that he may have killed his wife after overhearing them argue.  The next night she sees him putting what looks like a body bag into his trunk amidst a thunderstorm.While Claire's playing Jimmy Stewart, odd happenings begin to occur around the house.  She starts hearing whispers, doors blow open, a picture frame falls.  On their own they may seem coincidential, but in the context of all the other goings-on suggests the unimaginable, that their seemingly picturesque Victorian home is possessed.  Norman jokingly speculates that it's his father, in a particularly passive agressive move on his part, letting them know that he doesn't like the renovations they're making on his home.  Claire on the other hand, comes to believe it's their neighbors dead wife trying to goat her on to investigating her disappearance.Beyond that I don't want to give away too much of the plot except to say that the most foreshadowing moment in the movie occurs less than five minutes into it.  So for the very observant the twist shouldn't be too difficult to spot, though it doesn't seem to play in anywhere near as obvious or unsettling a way as it did on the big screen.What's so remarkable about this film is just how much fun Robert Zemeckis has with the material.  He squeezed this one in between making Cast Away and seems to be reveling in the lack of anticipation that comes with a supernatural thriller, as opposed to a Tom Hanks drama which has the weight of expected awards and a hundred million box office take to bare.  Here he just lets loose, allowing himself a vanity project to show off with, using new and unique camera angles which distract from the performances but sure are fun to watch.Both Harrison Ford (who plays Norman) and Michelle Pfeiffer give their careers much needed jumps with a couple of superb performances sure to strength their box office appeal, if nothing else.  Pfeiffer's asked to carry most of the movie as for much of the film Ford is limited to the role of the unsupportive husband, or at least until the last half hour when things really pick up.  Then he leaves quite an impression.This is a movie that, though it's only a popcorn flick, is truly revolutionary in the way it utilizes technology to further it's plot.  It's smart, scary and only to get better upon repeat viewing, a sure-fire sign of a potential classic in the making.",4,What  An  Exceptional  Thriller,985219200,"03 22, 2001",2001,3746,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'What', 'Beneath', 'mid-July', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'quot', 'twist', 'ending', 'quot', 'actors', 'were', 'so', 'tight-lipped', 'when', 'making', 'late', 'night', 'talk', 'show', 'up', 'being', 'disappointment', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'four', 'times', 'last', 'month', 'alone', 'release', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'come', 'appreciate', 'knowing', 'outcome', 'fun', 'really', 'more', 'distraction', 'when', 'know', 'twist', 'horizon', 'are', 'constantly', 'looking', 'Instead', 'suggest', 'allow', 'suspense', 'build', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'losing', 'patience', 'concerning', 'outcome', 'payoff', 'well', 'Pfeiffer', 'who', 'only', 'become', 'more', 'beautiful', 'age', 'Claire', 'Spencer', 'former', 'musician', 'wife', 'renowned', 'scientist', 'name', 'Norman', 'first', 'many', 'Hitchcock', 'references', 'being', 'offered', 'very', 'prestigious', 'position', 'late', 'father', 'school', 'family', 'Vermont', 'Claire', 'turn', 'dedicates', 'being', 'perfect', 'trophy', 'wife', 'mother', 'daughter', 'previous', 'marriage', 'Catlin', 'when', 'Caitlin', 'away', 'college', 'left', 'nothing', 'free', 'time', 'hands', 'triggering', 'empty', 'nest', 'episode', 'sorts', 'watching', 'neighbor', 'suspecting', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'wife', 'overhearing', 'argue', 'next', 'night', 'putting', 'what', 'body', 'bag', 'trunk', 'thunderstorm.While', 'Claire', 'playing', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'odd', 'happenings', 'begin', 'occur', 'house', 'hearing', 'whispers', 'doors', 'blow', 'open', 'picture', 'frame', 'own', 'may', 'seem', 'coincidential', 'context', 'other', 'goings-on', 'unimaginable', 'seemingly', 'picturesque', 'Victorian', 'home', 'possessed', 'Norman', 'jokingly', 'father', 'particularly', 'passive', 'agressive', 'move', 'part', 'letting', 'know', ""n't"", 'like', 'renovations', ""'re"", 'making', 'home', 'Claire', 'other', 'hand', 'believe', 'neighbors', 'dead', 'wife', 'trying', 'goat', 'investigating', 'disappearance.Beyond', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'say', 'most', 'foreshadowing', 'moment', 'movie', 'less', 'five', 'minutes', 'So', 'very', 'observant', 'twist', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'difficult', 'spot', ""n't"", 'seem', 'play', 'anywhere', 'obvious', 'unsettling', 'way', 'did', 'big', 'screen.What', 'so', 'remarkable', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'material', 'squeezed', 'one', 'making', 'Cast', 'Away', 'be', 'reveling', 'lack', 'anticipation', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'opposed', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'drama', 'weight', 'expected', 'awards', 'hundred', 'million', 'box', 'office', 'take', 'bare', 'Here', 'just', 'loose', 'allowing', 'vanity', 'project', 'show', 'off', 'using', 'new', 'unique', 'camera', 'angles', 'distract', 'performances', 'sure', 'are', 'fun', 'watch.Both', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'who', 'Norman', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'give', 'careers', 'much', 'needed', 'jumps', 'couple', 'superb', 'performances', 'sure', 'strength', 'box', 'office', 'appeal', 'nothing', 'else', 'Pfeiffer', 'asked', 'carry', 'most', 'movie', 'much', 'film', 'Ford', 'limited', 'role', 'unsupportive', 'husband', 'least', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'when', 'things', 'really', 'pick', 'up', 'Then', 'quite', 'impression.This', 'movie', 'only', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'truly', 'revolutionary', 'way', 'technology', 'further', 'plot', 'smart', 'scary', 'only', 'get', 'better', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'sure-fire', 'sign', 'potential', 'classic', 'making']",What Lies Beneath VHS

526144,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00003CXI6,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[5, 5]","Making a good movie of a ghost story is a ticklish business. There is a vast but treacherous chasm between Terror and Horror, and few can navigate it successfully, for Terror is the subtler art of the two, a fact attested to by the rarity of truly terrifying movies about Haunts.Think about that for a minute. While there are scores of excellent Horror movies awash in buckets of blood and gore that I would happily watch again and again, you can count the truly successful cinematic Ghost Tale on one hand. Why are Ghost Stories, which are the pinnacle of trule tales of Terror, so difficult to put on film?I think it has something to do with the nature of what terrifies, as opposed to what horrifies: Horror is a visceral and visual art, which repulses and horrifies by sight. Terror, on the other hand, is heightened by the unseen far more than the seen. The good Ghost Tale is the haunt of the guttering candle, the shape in the shadows, the thunderous knock on the wall of an empty room in an empty castle, the dimly heard footstep treading up a lonely stairwell.Only a few films have gotten this delicate balance right: the original ""The Haunting,"" Amenabar's superbly chilling ""The Others"", M. Night Shyamalan's ""Sixth Sense"", and the criminally underrated ""The Haunting of Julia"", the last of which is not available even on VHS! To this short list of worthy Terror films, I would add, without hesitation, Robert Zemeckis's superb little excursion in sheer spooky fright ""What Lies Beneath.""Yes, Zemeckis has studded this simple, frightful little tale with all manner of homages to Alfred Hitchcock, including nice little nods to ""Rope"", ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", and ""Suspicion"". But Zemeckis, a seasoned and skilled director who has a few trips to the Crypt under his belt, is not overly pleased with his cleverness; instead he spins out a crisply paced, beautifully filmed (cinematography by Don Burgess, who worked on ""Terminator 3"", ""Bourne Identity"" and ""Forrest Gump"")little movie that builds from a lurking sense of unease to a shrieking crescendo of full-bodied terror.The story is simple. Dr. Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford, grizzled and effectively obtuse) and his wife Claire (played by the always lovely Michelle Pfeiffer) are empty nesters. Their daughter has gone off to college, Dr. Spencer has his genetics research, and Claire---well, Claire has the summer house on the lake, memories, and a little too much time to herself.Claire quickly becomes caught up in the silence of the lake house, and the profusion of her memories---particularly some she has lost, or possibly buried. And what of her mysterious, reclusive, slightly sinister neighbors? What of the brusque professor-next-door's wife (played briskly by Miranda Otto, who even musters up her frightened eye in service of scares), who evidently lives in fear of her husband? And what of her sudden disappearance during a rainstorm?Worse still, what of the whispered voices in the house, doors slamming shut, and the bathtub filling up by itself?All classically spooky stuff, but all legendarily difficult stuff to get right if you want to truly creep the audience out. Zemeckis does it, littering the path to the white-knuckled conclusion (why, on the lake, of course...where else?) with red herrings and a bucketload of ghastly little moments designed to make your bones creep and tingle.But the pleasure of this journey is the getting there, and Zemeckis realizes that the best horror is painted on a palette of silence. ""What Lies Beneath"" benefits from its studied atmosphere of the malevolent. And when the Spook appears, as in all good Terror Tales it must, it is deliriously scary.""What Lies Beneath"" joins a select group of truly creepy terrifying films, and like the other members of that good company, this movie is ideal for a storm-swept weekend night with you, a blanket, a cup of hot spiced tea, and a warm and stoic cat.JSG",5,'Til Death do us Part?,1123804800,"08 12, 2005",2005,3921,"['Making', 'good', 'movie', 'ghost', 'story', 'ticklish', 'business', 'vast', 'treacherous', 'chasm', 'Terror', 'Horror', 'few', 'can', 'navigate', 'successfully', 'Terror', 'subtler', 'art', 'two', 'fact', 'attested', 'rarity', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'movies', 'Haunts.Think', 'minute', 'are', 'scores', 'excellent', 'Horror', 'movies', 'awash', 'buckets', 'blood', 'gore', 'would', 'happily', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'can', 'count', 'truly', 'successful', 'cinematic', 'Ghost', 'Tale', 'one', 'hand', 'Why', 'are', 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'are', 'pinnacle', 'trule', 'tales', 'Terror', 'so', 'difficult', 'put', 'film', 'think', 'something', 'do', 'nature', 'what', 'terrifies', 'opposed', 'what', 'horrifies', 'Horror', 'visceral', 'visual', 'art', 'horrifies', 'sight', 'Terror', 'other', 'hand', 'heightened', 'unseen', 'far', 'more', 'seen', 'good', 'Ghost', 'Tale', 'haunt', 'guttering', 'candle', 'shape', 'shadows', 'thunderous', 'knock', 'wall', 'empty', 'room', 'empty', 'castle', 'dimly', 'heard', 'footstep', 'treading', 'up', 'lonely', 'stairwell.Only', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'gotten', 'delicate', 'balance', 'right', 'original', 'Haunting', 'Amenabar', 'superbly', 'chilling', 'Others', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'Haunting', 'Julia', 'last', 'not', 'available', 'even', 'VHS', 'short', 'list', 'worthy', 'Terror', 'films', 'would', 'add', 'hesitation', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'superb', 'little', 'excursion', 'sheer', 'spooky', 'fright', 'What', 'Beneath', 'Yes', 'Zemeckis', 'studded', 'simple', 'frightful', 'little', 'tale', 'manner', 'homages', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'including', 'nice', 'little', 'nods', 'Rope', 'Vertigo', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Suspicion', 'Zemeckis', 'seasoned', 'skilled', 'director', 'who', 'few', 'trips', 'Crypt', 'belt', 'not', 'overly', 'pleased', 'cleverness', 'instead', 'out', 'crisply', 'paced', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'cinematography', 'Don', 'Burgess', 'who', 'worked', 'Terminator', '3', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'little', 'movie', 'lurking', 'sense', 'unease', 'shrieking', 'crescendo', 'full-bodied', 'terror.The', 'story', 'simple', 'Dr.', 'Norman', 'Spencer', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'grizzled', 'effectively', 'obtuse', 'wife', 'Claire', 'played', 'always', 'lovely', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'are', 'empty', 'nesters', 'daughter', 'gone', 'off', 'college', 'Dr.', 'Spencer', 'genetics', 'research', 'Claire', '-well', 'Claire', 'summer', 'house', 'lake', 'memories', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'herself.Claire', 'quickly', 'becomes', 'caught', 'up', 'silence', 'lake', 'house', 'profusion', 'memories', '-particularly', 'lost', 'possibly', 'buried', 'what', 'mysterious', 'reclusive', 'slightly', 'sinister', 'neighbors', 'What', 'brusque', 'professor-next-door', 'wife', 'played', 'briskly', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'who', 'even', 'up', 'frightened', 'eye', 'service', 'scares', 'who', 'evidently', 'fear', 'husband', 'what', 'sudden', 'disappearance', 'rainstorm', 'Worse', 'still', 'what', 'whispered', 'voices', 'house', 'doors', 'slamming', 'shut', 'bathtub', 'filling', 'up', 'classically', 'spooky', 'stuff', 'legendarily', 'difficult', 'stuff', 'get', 'right', 'want', 'truly', 'creep', 'audience', 'out', 'Zemeckis', 'littering', 'path', 'white-knuckled', 'conclusion', 'why', 'lake', 'course', 'where', 'else', 'red', 'herrings', 'bucketload', 'ghastly', 'little', 'moments', 'designed', 'make', 'bones', 'creep', 'tingle.But', 'pleasure', 'journey', 'getting', 'there', 'Zemeckis', 'best', 'horror', 'painted', 'palette', 'silence', 'What', 'Beneath', 'benefits', 'studied', 'atmosphere', 'malevolent', 'when', 'Spook', 'good', 'Terror', 'must', 'deliriously', 'scary', 'What', 'Beneath', 'select', 'group', 'truly', 'creepy', 'terrifying', 'films', 'other', 'members', 'good', 'company', 'movie', 'ideal', 'storm-swept', 'weekend', 'night', 'blanket', 'cup', 'hot', 'spiced', 'tea', 'warm', 'stoic', 'cat.JSG']",What Lies Beneath VHS
526145,A1KFWSYZIOBI3Y,B00003CXI6,"DaRRen ""Darren""","[1, 5]","There are moments where this film rated a 4 - possibly even a 5. But these moments are overwhelmed by a few negative factors.1. The length. This is too long - especially for what the movie accomplishes. The last 1/2 hour was too drawn out, and this allowed for unnecessary melodrama and overwrought performances.2. The ghost. This is possibly the most annoying ghost I have ever seen. Rather than being a sympathetic character, I began to loathe the ghost. Her method was embarrassing, confusing, dangerous and not even suspenseful, because this story has been told over and over again.3. Stereotypes. Filled with gender stereotypes: The woman who gives up her career and settles into homemaking. The rich folks with only trite things about which to worry. The man - stuck in his career and ignoring his beautiful blonde wife. The man who has an affair. The man who is violent and kills the mistress. The mother grieving because her daughter leaves for college. Seductive young college student pulling in male professor (which we learn about through a possession experience). Bleh.4. Completely bizarre behavior.  Well this comes from the stereotypes. The hysterical woman showing at the husband's workplace and making a scene. The sad woman getting drunk on white wine.

This film is still gonna scare the devil out of you (unless you have no pulse at all)!!Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent (as in everything she does). And Harrison is solid, of course.Hitchcock references abound here....and I love it!There's Pfeiffer peering at the supposed-murderous neighbor. And suddenly she finds him staring back. Plus a scene where Michelle witnesses this same neighbor stuffing a large object into the trunk of his car on a stormy night, making us think it just might be 'the Mrs.'. This is all a la ""Rear Window"".And there's the bathtub/shower references all through the flick, reminding us of ""Psycho"". Another reference to Psycho was when Pfeiffer pulls down the shower curtain off of its rod, similar to Janet Leigh when she met her demise in 1960.I just had fun (and fright) with this fine film, even with a completely impossible ending.Too much over-analyzing is bad for anything.Just WATCH IT!!

526148,AZ1H3VLCDR298,B00003CXI6,Derrick Thomas,"[4, 5]","What really sets this movie apart from other &quot;horror&quot; movies is that it is really limited on the violence, abeit some scenes have scary situations, but nothing like Scream or The Amityville Horror. While it may not be suitable for small children, you can rest assured your older children will not be exposed to mindless violence or foul language. Most of What Lies Beneath's scary moments  involve &quot;jumping out of your seat&quot; scares during the first half, such as Pfeiffer's character walking down the hallway, and all of a sudden something falls behind her that will make you jump.The cast of characters is relatively small, so you get to focus more on Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford(both who have aged fantastically over the years) who are a married couple now with the house to themselves after the daughter goes of to college. Pfeiffer, after a series of events, begins to suspect that her next door neighbor may have been murdered by her husband. She does a little investigating, with a little &quot;Rear Window&quot; thing going on, and then she starts to encounter strange things in her own home.The bathtub fills up by itself, words appear on a computer screen without anyone typing them, and as she suspects a ghost, Ford just thinks she is making it up in her head. This is only the tip of the iceberg, the story goes much deeper than this, with many twists and turns that will keep you guessing many things until the end.My only complaint is that some scenes last longer than they should, with more dialog than necessary, especially in the beginning. But &quot;beneath&quot; that, you will be entranced by the master direction of Robert Zemeckis(Castaway, Forrest Gump), and the superb acting abilities of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford.",4,A stylish Hitchcock-like take on the ghost story genre,982800000,"02 22, 2001",2001,1782,"['What', 'really', 'movie', 'apart', 'other', 'quot', 'horror', 'quot', 'movies', 'really', 'limited', 'violence', 'abeit', 'scenes', 'have', 'scary', 'situations', 'nothing', 'Scream', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'small', 'children', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'older', 'children', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'exposed', 'mindless', 'violence', 'foul', 'language', 'Most', 'What', 'Lies', 'Beneath', 'scary', 'moments', 'involve', 'quot', 'jumping', 'seat', 'quot', 'scares', 'first', 'half', 'such', 'Pfeiffer', 'character', 'walking', 'down', 'hallway', 'sudden', 'something', 'will', 'make', 'jump.The', 'cast', 'characters', 'relatively', 'small', 'get', 'focus', 'more', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'who', 'have', 'aged', 'fantastically', 'years', 'who', 'are', 'married', 'couple', 'now', 'house', 'daughter', 'college', 'Pfeiffer', 'series', 'events', 'suspect', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', 'husband', 'little', 'investigating', 'little', 'quot', 'Rear', 'Window', 'quot', 'thing', 'going', 'then', 'encounter', 'strange', 'things', 'own', 'home.The', 'bathtub', 'up', 'words', 'appear', 'computer', 'screen', 'anyone', 'typing', 'ghost', 'Ford', 'just', 'making', 'up', 'head', 'only', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'story', 'much', 'deeper', 'many', 'twists', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'many', 'things', 'end.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'scenes', 'last', 'longer', 'should', 'more', 'dialog', 'necessary', 'especially', 'beginning', 'quot', 'beneath', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'entranced', 'master', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Castaway', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'superb', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Harrison', 'Ford']",What Lies Beneath VHS

526150,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXI6,D. Litton,"[1, 3]","If you've never been afraid to get into your bathtub, you will be after watching &quot;What Lies Beneath,&quot; the latest thriller from acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis, starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pheiffer as a married couple whose lives are about to be changed by a haunting secret and a terrifying entity. This is as good as adult contemporary thrillers get; with a little bit of the elements of &quot;The Blair-Witch Project,&quot; &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; and the famed movies of Alfred Hitchcock, Zemeckis is able to bring to the movie a complete sense of unease, while adding diversity and intensity to the intelligent story.Claire Spencer is having a little trouble coping with her daughter moving away to college, and just when she thinks she is feeling better, a frightening cry from the other side of her fence leads her to believe that her new neighbor, Mary Feur, is in danger of her husband. After many strange events and a ghostly apparition in her house, Claire believes that Mary has been killed by her husband, but is dismayed and thinks herself crazy when she discovers otherwise. But the apparitions still keep coming, little by little: strange whispers fluttering through the house, an overly-anxious front door, and falling picture frames, all of which lead to the clues Claire needs to put the puzzle together. When she discovers the shocking truth, she realizes that her husband, Norman Spencer, is not who he seems to be, and what lies beneath his outward appearance is something that can mean her end.This movie is a terrific example of the fact that a movie can have a PG-13 rating and still deliver on the grounds of suspense and chills. In using the techniques of previous films, Zemeckis makes them his own and keeps the story solid and fluid. You might say that the first part of this movie is a first-class take on the element of suspense from &quot;The Blair-Witch Project,&quot; which is highly acclaimed for its ability to scare us without showing us what's behind the creeps. &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; is able to carry this technique off as well as Claire begins to hear and see strange things without ever being able to fully make out what is going on. A small fragment of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; plays a part here, as Claire begins to understand that the entity making contact with her wishes retribution for something done to her.Of all of the elements of this film, Hitchcock's techniques and brilliance are clearly evident throughout this film, from small, minute camera angles to the music and the way certain shots last so long without a cut-in. In one scene, Pheiffer walks out of her darkened bathroom, into her bedroom, and then out into the hall again, where she sees steam rising out of the bathroom doorway. This is all done in one shot, a typical Hitchcock technique that works so well with the story at hand. The music of certain scenes, especially in the climactic ending, will have you thinking back to classics like &quot;Psycho,&quot; which set the standard in horror movie soundtracks. Instead of seeming played out and dull, the way in which the film uses each of them in its own way is quite fresh, inventive and new.While the filming techniques have been used before, the idea for the story also adds to the originality of the film as a whole. The aspect that adds the most uniqueness is the source of the entity that haunts the Spencer household, and the reasons for which it does so. I've never seen this done before in a movie of this kind, and it fits the mold perfectly in keeping with the idea that Claire is in danger not from the apparitions that plague her, but by something alive and real that she holds very dear. Without giving too much away, the ending is a bit of a stretch, but nevertheless keeps moving like the rest of the film, and once it is over, you'll find that it was well worth the wait. The special effects, which mostly take the place of using actual people in the roles of ghosts, add so much to the script and the overall effect of intensity. Alan Silvestri's frightening score will also make you jump when it strikes a high chord in the most thrilling moments of the film.While the actors in all parts do a terrific job bringing the movie to life, this is clearly Michelle Pheiffer's movie, for she will carry most of the action, the emotion and the story with her. She portrays Claire Spencer, the happy wife who discovers secrets permeating through her marriage. She is by far the most complex character, and when she starts putting the pieces together, her entwining emotions are played to perfection by Pheiffer, who is superb. Harrison Ford is the other leading character, the husband Norman Spencer who has more secrets than truths in his life. Ford is excellent in this role, which is strikingly different from many of his other roles in which he plays the good guy, the hero who saves the day. But he carries it off with intelligence and, at times, wit. Diana Scarwid adds the needed comic relief in the form of Claire's best friend, but it turns out that she will play a minor yet important part in unlocking the mystery.With so many elements of past films going for it, &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; is a classy and intelligent ensemble of complex characters wandering through a world of lies, deceit, fright, and secrecy. It makes the audience jumps at the right times, while keeping their hearts beating juts a bit faster in between. Be sure to try and catch all the eerie ghosts and entities the are all throughout the film; there are a lot.",4,Instensifying and fast-paced!,981072000,"02 2, 2001",2001,5565,"[""'ve"", 'never',

""What Lies Beneath"" finds a geneticist (Ford) and his wife (Pfeiffer) alone together in their spacious Vermont home after their daughter leaves to attend college.  While Ford goes off to attend scientific conferences, Pfeiffer stays home - where things get spookier by the day.References to Hitchcock's films abound, from a plot setup that echoes ""Rear Window"" to textual and thematic nods to ""Rebecca,"" ""Suspicion,"" and ""Psycho."" There's even a wink to 1926's ""The Lodger"" (Hitchcock's earliest success) as Zemeckis shoots key moments from beneath a glass floor.Ford is no stranger to Hitchcock-influenced films, having starred in Roman Polanski's skillful ""Frantic"" (1988). But it's Pfeiffer who carries the movie, delivering the gamut of requisite emotions and keeping the film completely watchable even as the plot machinery begins to creak in the film's second act. Red herrings, blind alleys, and pat explanations pile up, threatening to undermine the suspense so effectively generated in the movie's first hour. But Zemeckis rescues the film with an astonishing finale, as exciting as it is implausible. My advice?

526163,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B00003CXI6,Elisabeth,"[1, 1]","Director Robert Zemeckis gives us your typical suspenseful moments like the mist escaping the bathroom door, the wide angle bathtub shot reminiscent of The Shining, a dog growling at an evil presence, someone opening a door and then when they close it, a person is standing there, and so on.  Seen it all before, but still created suspense nonetheless.Also adding to the movie's suspense is the lighting tricks.  For instance, you'll have a scene that's all dark and then a bolt of lightning will illuminate a figure you didn't know was there.There's also extreme close-up shots that add tension, too.  I especially liked the scene where Michelle Pfeiffer is slowly walking down the stairs backwards and all we're allowed to see is the back of her heels.  It's a very quiet scene and then there's a bang that makes you jump.Not only are these close-up shots unsettling, but I thought they were artistic, too.  One bathtub scene shows us just a woman's legs and it reminded me of a similar painting by Frida Kahlo.There's good special effects in this movie, but what I appreciated most is that these special effects are used sparingly, only when needed.  It annoys me when a movie is all special effects at the expense of a good story.  What's funny is that I've seen this movie several times, but only in my last viewing did I notice at the very end, there's an image of a woman's face in the ice.  It's very subtle, but pretty clever nonetheless.I gave this movie 4 stars only because I thought the ending got a little too unrealistic and silly for my taste.  I also thought the movie could've been edited better (ran a little too long).

He is a very versatile director who can adeptly shift from genre to genre.  In this film, he again demonstrates his talent, creating a spooky supernatural thriller delivering some of the best suspense I've seen in years.The story by Sarah Kernochan (""9  Weeks"", ""Sommersby"") where the dead victim communicates with someone living to finger the killer is not innovative and has been done numerous times in various forms.

Zemeckis' use of camera and sound produces extraordinary suspense and startling surprises that make viewers jump out of their seats.  There is a lot of silence in this film with no background music which makes the surprises that much more dramatic.  He peppers the film with false alarms so you never know if the buildup is for something genuinely scary or just the dog.  Though none of the techniques is new, they are all used extremely effectively.  The film creates terror with very little gore and violence, proving that the use of these techniques in horror films is overdone and unnecessary.  Often what we don't see is far more frightening than what we do.The acting in this film is outstanding.  Michelle Pfeiffer gives a brilliant performance as Claire; the overwrought wife who everyone thinks is losing her mind when she starts talking about communing with the dead.  Pfeiffer takes her character right to the edge and her hysterical fear at the events that transpire is awesome.  Harrison Ford plays an unaccustomed role, departing from his normal white hat hero.  He shows great range by handling the sinister aspects of his character nefariously.  Diana Scarwid also gives an enjoyable performance as Claire's best friend.Though this film doesn't redefine the genre, it is a fine example of frightening suspense under the guidance of a talented director.  I rated it an 8/10.

526176,AGQ8TQ8U3KG19,B00003CXI6,"""goodboygonebadd""","[0, 0]","No one sees to have clued in to the fact that What Lies Beneath is essentially an amped-up, glitzified re-working of The Changeling.  Let's examine the similarities, shall we: 1) We have a house with a ghost in it.  At first, the ghost seems threatening, but really is trying to make contact with the protagonist.  2) The protagonist begins to investigate, uncovering a mystery (and murder)that made the spirit so unhappy. 3) The protagonist is really in more danger from someone living than he/she is from the ghost.  4)  The most obvious clue to the similarity between the two flicks: In The Changeling, Trish Van Devere plays a character named Claire Norman.  In What Lies Beneath, Harrison Ford plays Norman, and Michelle Pfeiffer plays Claire.  Coincidence? Oh, please.  Really subtle, Clark Gregg (WLB's writer).That said, What Lies Beneath is still a solid, entertaining supernatural thriller that hits most of the right notes.  Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer are very good, and the direction, score, and cinematography are all evocative and effective.  It also is a multi-levelled story, revealing the negativity that ""lies beneath"" the seemingly-perfect marriage. In a nutshell, the plot is like this:  Michelle Pfeiffer becomes obsessed with a spirit in her house than she first mistakes for the missing woman from the house next door.  It turns out that the real answer hits much closer to home.  Much closer.Bottom line: What Lies Beneath is a good, entertaining thriller that is creepy with a few decent scares (the last twenty minutes are edge of your seat stuff).

526178,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00003CXI6,Gregor von Kallahann,"[2, 3]","I jest just a bit with that headline. This film is more disappointing than truly contemptible. WHAT LIES BENEATH looked like it might be that rare Hollywood commodity: a horror film geared toward a somewhat more mature audience. Casting respected actors (and major stars) like Ford and Pfeiffer seemed promising. And even though I am not a huge fan of director Zimeckis, I figured you could count on him for a solid, if not necessarily inspired product.Most intriguing, however, was the ""Hitchcockian"" buzz that surrounded the film. Most of the commentary about the film cited the Hitchcock influence, which is enough to make any suspense buff--or classic cinemaphile--pay attention. But I was disappointed on that score as well.Yes, there are nods to such classics as REAR WINDOW and PSYCHO in this film, but guess what! The key difference (and it really is key) between this and almost ANY of the master's films is the supernatural element that is so dominant in this movie. I can't think of a single Hitchcock classic where the suspense stemmed from otherworldly forces. Human nature, not the supernatural, was the source of all things evil in those films. THE BIRDS was about as spooky as things ever got in the Hitchcockian universe, but that still had more to do the unexplainable in the NATURAL world, not any supernatural one.It is certainly possible, however, to take your Hitchcockian influence and spin it off into a different direction. Sure, you can have your icy blonde haunted by real ghosts rather than by her inner demons. But you know, you better do it good, and you better be original. WLB is not particularly good, and while its Hitchcockiness may be in doubt, it is certainly derivative numerous other suspense and horror films. I won't say that there are no surprises, but even they weren't all that original. A viewer might be surprised at the identity of the villain, for instance, but no one will be startled to see how hard that villain is to actually kill and keep dead. At this point in horror film history, how many viewers are truly taken aback when an apparently dead bad guy's eyes suddenly pop open (glaringly, of course).I've read a number of critics' reviews of this film and was not at all surprised to find that they really were mostly negative. I'm also not surprised to see that many of my fellow ""citizen reviewers"" here at Amazon do love this movie and find it merits a full five stars. Well, I'm not a cinematic snob (I hope) and don't always side with the pros, but this time out I kinda do. Yes, this film has its merits--not the least of which is Michelle Pfeiffer's nuanced performance--but as a horror/suspense effort, it is seriously flawed. The fact that it visually quotes classic films of the genre, only serves to point up its own weaknesses.",3,BENEATH Contempt,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,2794,"['jest', 'just', 'bit', 'headline', 'film', 'more', 'disappointing', 'truly', 'contemptible', 'WHAT', 'LIES', 'BENEATH', 'looked', 'might', 'be', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'commodity', 'horror', 'film', 'geared', 'somewhat', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'Casting', 'respected', 'actors', 'major', 'stars', 'Ford', 'Pfeiffer', 'seemed', 'promising', 'even', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'director', 'Zimeckis', 'figured', 'could', 'count', 'solid', 'not', 'necessarily', 'inspired', 'product.Most', 'intriguing', 'however', 'was', 'Hitchcockian', 'buzz', 'surrounded', 'film', 'Most', 'commentary', 'film', 'cited', 'Hitchcock', 'influence', 'enough', 'make', 'suspense', 'buff', 'classic', 'cinemaphile', 'pay', 'attention', 'was', 'disappointed', 'score', 'well.Yes', 'are', 'nods', 'such', 'classics', 'REAR', 'WINDOW', 'PSYCHO', 'film', 'guess', 'what', 'key', 'difference', 'really', 'key', 'almost', 'ANY', 'master', 'films', 'supernatural', 'element', 'so', 'dominant', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'where', 'suspense', 'stemmed', 'otherworldly', 'forces', 'Human', 'nature', 'not', 'supernatural', 'was', 'source', 'things', 'evil', 'films', 'BIRDS', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'spooky', 'things', 'ever', 'got', 'Hitchcockian', 'universe', 'still', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'unexplainable', 'NATURAL', 'world', 'not', 'supernatural', 'one.It', 'certainly', 'possible', 'however', 'take', 'Hitchcockian', 'influence', 'spin', 'off', 'different', 'direction', 'Sure', 'can', 'have', 'icy', 'blonde', 'haunted', 'real', 'ghosts', 'rather', 'inner', 'demons', 'know', 'better', 'do', 'good', 'better', 'be', 'original', 'WLB', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'Hitchcockiness', 'may', 'be', 'doubt', 'certainly', 'derivative', 'numerous', 'other', 'suspense', 'horror', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', 'surprises', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'original', 'viewer', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'identity', 'villain', 'instance', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'startled', 'see', 'how', 'hard', 'villain', 'actually', 'kill', 'keep', 'dead', 'point', 'horror', 'film', 'history', 'how', 'many', 'viewers', 'are', 'truly', 'taken', 'aback', 'when', 'apparently', 'dead', 'bad', 'guy', 'eyes', 'suddenly', 'pop', 'open', 'glaringly', 'course', ""'ve"", 'read', 'number', 'critics', 'reviews', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'find', 'really', 'were', 'mostly', 'negative', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'surprised', 'see', 'many', 'fellow', 'citizen', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Amazon', 'do', 'love', 'movie', 'find', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'cinematic', 'snob', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'side', 'pros', 'time', 'out', 'kinda', 'do', 'Yes', 'film', 'merits', 'not', 'least', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'horror/suspense', 'effort', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'fact', 'visually', 'classic', 'films', 'genre', 'only', 'point', 'up', 'own', 'weaknesses']",What Lies Beneath VHS

526182,A37DLVPKJZGSQF,B00003CXI6,Hannibal,"[2, 2]","What Lies Beneath, a brilliant, masterfully played out homage to Hitchcock is quite frankly the scariest movie I have ever seen. I came out of the cinema pale and shaking and while I was watching the film I was so scared I even had to shield my eyes at parts. All the scary parts are brought to life by a great score with manages to grab you in the nuts at the most unexpected times. The movie is over 2 hours long but never tires. I have watched this about 5 times now and every time I get the chills and always appreciate the film more. Robert Zemeckis excellent direction reminds us of how many great movies directors can do in 1 year. Cast Away and this film were both brilliant experiences and Zemeckis directs them both brilliantly. The performances excel, with Michelle Pfeiffer excellent as Claire Spencer who, while trying to uncover a masterful mystery, is slowly losing her mind. Harrison Ford brings up many shocks and takes a surprising back seat. His performance is fabulous. What Lies Beneath builds its suspense - especially in one horrifyingly Hitchcockian bathtub sequence - and always uses its ideas. I couldn't find many plot holes but the film can be complex at times.

What Lies Beneath contains some nice surprises and you're better off enjoying them as such. Alas, if you have watched the trailer or read the wrong reviews here at Amazon, you probably have a fairly decent summary of WLB in your head.To tell the truth, I was enjoying all the scares for the largest part of this film. Still, the 'finale' came across as the usual Hollywood stuff, and it all ended too nicely, too convenient (my opinion). And it moved along at a somewhat slow pace (no big gripe), and there are scenes that could have used some polishing. I even thought there was the odd ??? (huh effect) here and there, where only the soundtrack goes 'scary' while on the screen nothing creepy occurs.But casting all these complaints aside, there's still plenty of reasons why to invest your time in this. Ford and Pfeiffer are quite good as, respectively, husband and wife (Pfeiffer was the better of the two, IMO). Supporting cast is fine too. The real kicker is the bathtub, though.

In other words, the ghost in the movie is not the malevolent entity in the movie, but the ghost's killer is.  However, these type of revenge ghost story movies do not work very well to present a truly pure horror movie viewing experience because once you realize the ghost just wants revenge, the focus of the movie changes to the punishment of the mortal killer(s) and much of the suspense and mystery of the supernatural becomes secondary or maybe even lost completely.  This is unfortunate and such is the case with both ""What Lies Beneath"" and ""Stir Of Echoes"".  Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer star in ""What Lies Beneath"" and they are both great actors and I have no problem with them in this movie...no, it's the script that I do not feel presents pure and unadulterated horror.  If you just want to see a drama, this movie is fine but, as a horror movie, it does not function well as such...in fact, as a horror movie, this movie sucks.  The only movie like this that actually works as a horror movie in my opinion is a movie called ""The Changeling"" with George C. Scott...I would recommend ""The Changeling"" any day over ""What Lies Beneath"" or any other movie like this which have become somewhat popular in the horror genre over the last 10-15 years.  Unfortunately, these movies are riddled by a common anti-climactic flaw which extinguishes the mystery of the supernatural which ignited the audience's interest in the movie in the first place.

526195,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00003CXI6,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[12, 29]","Okay, imagine an episode of Tales From The Crypt (whose television program was actually co-created by this film's director Robert Zemeckis) with a good cast, a good budget, a good director, and one of the more interesting premises of a film this year. Now imagine the worst script possible being attached to it, and there you have &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;, easily the worst film of 2000 because of its sheer, transparent joy in dumbing itself down from what could have been a shocking, disturbing, multi-leveled thriller to a crowd-pleasing mish-mash of Hitchcockian cliches, over-the-top performances, and an ending that goes on about twenty minutes too long. What is wrong with Robert Zemeckis? He who was the mastermind behind such truly great films like &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and the executive producer of one of the most underrated films of the 90's, Peter Jackson's &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, brings us this film which seems to have consciously made an effort to make itself stupid. Of course, Zemeckis has had his share of misfires such as &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; and the abysmal sequels to &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, but after his superb direction in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and his support of &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, I was hoping that those days were over. But I was wrong. Now onto the movie itself. Its plot is very strong: A happily-married couple (Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfieffer) who finally have some time to rekindle the flames of their romance after sending their daughter off to college, find that their beautiful new colonial house... is haunted. And it just so happens to be haunted by the ghost of a young college girl who Ford's character, a brilliant college science professor, had an affair with. Makes for a pretty strong ghost story, right? Wrong. Merely because the film tries too hard to make the events of the physical world responsible for the terror that the spiritual world brings into it. Whatever happened to ghost stories that happened seemingly for no reason? Doesn't that make things scarier and more immediate when terrible things happen to good people without justification? Apparently, Zemeckis and Co. didn't think so. So we have one climax followed by another and another and another and another until we finally get to the real one that not only is embarassingly absurd, but gives no real satisfaction. You're left feeling empty and insulted because where the film could have disturbed and shocked in an intelligent manner, it went for the cheap Hollywood ending that wraps everything up in a neat little package so you can walk out of the theater feeling good that the evil-doer is punished and the innocent walk free.

Her husband is boorish, dull, moody Harrison Ford. He frowns a lot. For one hundred million dollars it took to make this snooze-fest, you wonder where did all the money go? Certainly not for special effects. A tub filled with water with mist swirling around was done routinely back in the 30s. Some special effects. Certainly not for the wardrobe. Mousy little Michelle as the betroubled heroine wears that much beloved outfit of mousy heroines everywhere: jeans and tennis shoes. What a wardrobe! The only thing missing is her bottle of Evian water held against her chest, with the label showing, to show how mod she is. Michelle's character is so delicate and terrified of everything that she screams when she sees a shadow and she screams when the phone rings. In one pivotal scene, she actually picks up a razor-sharp shard of mirror to protect herself. Has she ever cut herself before? Can't she find something heavier than a piece of glass to protect herself? The whole film is bathed in a watery, drab light. And you wonder what the timid, delicate, child=like bride like Michelle ever see in her boorish, brooding husband--and vice versa? As for the big jolt at the end, you've got it figured it out if you've watched anything by Hitchcock. How I would love to see what he would have done with this predictable soap opera, with some swirling mist thrown in and a heroine so scared of her shadow that the part should have been written as that of a two-year-old girl.

Ford and Pfeiffer are pretty fantastic actors but even they seem kinda bogged down by the story which as much as it tries for twists and turns its so obvious where its going that the alleged big reveal is of no shock to anyone with half a brain.Don't get me wrong I've seen worse rip-offs of Hitchcock's style and even his ideas (like ""Disturbia"" for example), but ""What Lies Beneath"" is a big budget, overdone and fairly bland suspense movie. Its not the actors and the director don't try, but when its so clear what the conclusion is no amount of window dressing or fancy film making can help elevate it. *1/2 out of 4 stars.",2,Hitchcock this is not,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,1728,"['So', 'Norman', 'Spencer', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'noted', 'research', 'scientist', 'college', 'wife', 'Claire', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'have', 'just', 'sent', 'Claire', 'only', 'daughter', 'Norman', 'step', 'kid', 'Claire', 'still', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'retirement', 'being', 'concert', 'cellist', 'car', 'accident', 'hurt', 'months', 'daughter', 'college', 'Claire', 'hearing', 'voices', 'noticing', 'strange', 'things', 'face', 'young', 'woman', 'lake', 'house', 'things', 'are', 'related', 'neighbors', 'especially', 'wife', 'recently', 'disappeared', 'seemingly', 'reason', 'hearing', 'Norman', 'suggest', 'wife', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'therapist', 'advice', 'contact', 'spirit', 'happy', 'couple', 'ouija', 'board', 'best', 'friend', 'named', 'Jody', 'try', 'help', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'spirit', 'opening', 'shot', 'movie', 'obvious', 'director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'trying', 'pay', 'homage', 'famed', 'master', 'suspense', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'however', 'Hitchcock', 'Zemeckis', 'mark', 'here', 'Ford', 'Pfeiffer', 'are', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'even', 'seem', 'kinda', 'bogged', 'down', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'twists', 'so', 'obvious', 'where', 'going', 'alleged', 'big', 'reveal', 'shock', 'anyone', 'brain.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'rip-offs', 'Hitchcock', 'style', 'even', 'ideas', 'Disturbia', 'example', 'What', 'Beneath', 'big', 'budget', 'overdone', 'fairly', 'bland', 'suspense', 'movie', 'not', 'actors', 'director', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'when', 'so', 'clear', 'what', 'conclusion', 'amount', 'window', 'dressing', 'fancy', 'film', 'making', 'can', 'help', 'elevate', '4', 'stars']",What Lies Beneath VHS

Harrison Ford, on his behalf did exceptionally well, but it must be known that the star of WLB is Michelle Pfeiffer. Since it is centered around her, of course they would show more of her. But this woman is magnificent. Pfeiffer took a middle-aged woman watching her only daugher go off to college and turned her into a woman struggling to discover the truth behind mysterious happenings. The beginning of the movie starts off as any movie would, introducing the characters, and setting up plot points. There's also a false accusation which makes you think the whole movie will be about that one thing, but then an unexpected twist happens. And I loved the way they did that! I won't give away the twist for those of you who haven't had the chance to see WLB. Anyway, the middle is spent with mysterious going ons, and Pfeiffer's character trying to understand what's going on. As soon as she does get a grip on what's going on, she is determined to get to the bottom of the story. Which she does, in the end. I must say, if you see nothing but the end of this movie, you will be blown off the edge of your seat. Of course it would be better to watch the full length of the movie, but the ending is spectacular.

If you want to see the film and not know what's going to happen, you must stay away from all adverts of this classy, hip thriller. I, fortunately, knew nothing about the movie when I went to see it, so I was lucky. But, if you see the trailer, you'll be able to guess the end twist within the first second. However, once you keep yourself darned away from that advertisement, your on the right track, and are sure to like this chilling and thought-provoking film.Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford), a university research scientist, is growing more and more concerned about his wife, Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer), a retired concert cellist who a year ago was involved in a serious auto accident, and who has just sent off her daughter Caitlin (Norman's stepdaughter) to college. Now, Claire reports hearing voices and witnessing eerie occurrences in and around their lakeside Vermont home, including seeing the face of a young woman reflected in water. An increasingly frightened Claire thinks the phenomena have something to do with the couple living next door, especially since the wife has disappeared without apparent explanation. At her husband's urging, Claire starts to see a therapist; she tells him she thinks the house is being haunted by a ghost. His advice? Try to make contact. Enlisting the help of her best friend, Jody (Diana Scarwid), and a ouija board, Claire seeks to find out the truth of What Lies Beneath.At the very, very end the film kinds of drains away and leaves us with something a little more lifeless than the first hour and a half, but, flaws aside, What Lies Beneath is an excellent film. However, to call it a film or a movie is underestimating this thriller - it's more of an experience. What Lies Beneath's spooks and scares will practically traumatise you for the coming days. It's a truly horrifying piece of cinema, behind The Exorcist as the scariest film of all time. I couldn't stop jumping out of my seat and my face was pale when I came out of the cinema. It may not have the brilliance of The Exorcist, but it certainly has the style, the high performance level and the true smell of sheer horror that The Exorcist had included in 1973.Not for everyone, but for people who want a lot of fun as well as a lot of seriously sweaty scares, What Lies Beneath is the perfect night out.",4,Sheer horror,985651200,"03 27, 2001",2001,2391,"['What', 'BeneathScore', '78/100Beware', 'trailer', 'What', 'Beneath', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'must', 'stay', 'away', 'adverts', 'classy', 'hip', 'thriller', 'fortunately', 'knew', 'nothing', 'movie', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'was', 'lucky', 'see', 'trailer', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'guess', 'end', 'twist', 'first', 'second', 'However', 'once', 'keep', 'darned', 'away', 'advertisement', 'right', 'track', 'are', 'sure', 'like', 'chilling', 'thought-provoking', 'film.Norman', 'Spencer', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'university', 'research', 'scientist', 'growing', 'more', 'more', 'concerned', 'wife', 'Claire', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'retired', 'concert', 'cellist', 'who', 'year', 'ago', 'was', 'involved', 'serious', 'auto', 'accident', 'who', 'just', 'sent', 'off', 'daughter', 'Caitlin', 'Norman', 'stepdaughter', 'college', 'Now', 'Claire', 'hearing', 'voices', 'witnessing', 'eerie', 'occurrences', 'lakeside', 'Vermont', 'home', 'including', 'seeing', 'face', 'young', 'woman', 'reflected', 'water', 'increasingly', 'frightened', 'Claire', 'phenomena', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'couple', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'especially', 'wife', 'disappeared', 'apparent', 'explanation', 'husband', 'urging', 'Claire', 'see', 'therapist', 'house', 'being', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'advice', 'Try', 'make', 'contact', 'Enlisting', 'help', 'best', 'friend', 'Jody', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'ouija', 'board', 'Claire', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'What', 'Lies', 'Beneath.At', 'very', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'kinds', 'drains', 'away', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'lifeless', 'first', 'hour', 'half', 'flaws', 'aside', 'What', 'Beneath', 'excellent', 'film', 'However', 'call', 'film', 'movie', 'underestimating', 'thriller', 'more', 'experience', 'What', 'Beneath', 'spooks', 'scares', 'will', 'practically', 'traumatise', 'coming', 'days', 'truly', 'horrifying', 'piece', 'cinema', 'Exorcist', 'scariest', 'film', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'jumping', 'seat', 'face', 'was', 'pale', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'cinema', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'brilliance', 'Exorcist', 'certainly', 'style', 'high', 'performance', 'level', 'true', 'smell', 'sheer', 'horror', 'Exorcist', 'had', 'included', '1973.Not', 'everyone', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'lot', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'seriously', 'sweaty', 'scares', 'What', 'Beneath', 'perfect', 'night', 'out']",What Lies Beneath VHS

526216,A18BV4O63DOWNH,B00003CXI6,"""juno2""","[3, 7]","*What Lies Beneath*  continues Hollywood's recent foray into developing respectable horror films and / or ghost stories.  This one isn't quite as good as last year's  *The Sixth Sense*  and  *Stir of Echoes*, but it does deliver a handful of quality scares, and the production values are good enough to make the ghostly visitations not look ridiculous.But there's something missing here . . . or perhaps, something ADDED that's unwelcome.  Namely, the presence of Big Guns, i.e., A-list actors  (Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford)  and an A-list director  (Robert Zemeckis).  What's ADDED contributes to what's missing, which of course is originality.  Or daring.  Or the unusual.  The presence of million-dollar celebrities almost guarantees that any movie will be conventional, that it will cozy up to safe cliches and well-worn storylines, that it will vastly serve said celebrities'  egos, and  *What Lies Beneath*  is no exception.  (Bruce Willis'  recent collaborations with the talented M. Night Shyamalan is an exception which merely proves the rule.)  Zemeckis certainly pampers his Big Guns in this feature:  Pfeiffer and Ford live in a Martha Stewart / Ethan Allan / shabby-chic Vermont, in a Martha Stewart / (etc.)  home.  Not content to have the main characters be business people or doctors or something, the screenwriters give them glamorous careers:  he's a geneticist; she's a former cellist.  Pfeiffer's first husband, also a musician, died some years ago, and despite her new marriage to rock-solid Ford, she's a little off-balance . . . i.e., ripe for a visitation from a ghost.  Incidentally, I may as well say that the two principals have all the chemistry of two icebergs passing in the night.  Mr. Ford continues the non-emotive, rather sullen, muttering style of acting he's lately perfected, and Pfeiffer looks vaguely ticked off and certainly HUNGRY  (the woman needs to gain about 10 pounds).OK, so forget the characterizations . . . what about the plot?  Well, the less said the better, because the movie delivers a  &quot;surprise ending&quot;  a la  *The Sixth Sense*.  I will only say that the  &quot;crisis-stretch&quot;  not only goes on for too long, but also renders the ghost of the drowned woman that has haunted Pfeiffer's Claire through the whole movie almost irrelevant.  You finish this movie saying to yourself, &quot;Was the ghost really necessary?&quot;  But that's typical Zemeckis, who favors exciting plots over logical ones.",2,Not much lies beneath  *What Lies Beneath*.,977875200,"12 27, 2000",2000,2476,"['Lies', 'Beneath*', 'Hollywood', 'recent', 'foray', 'developing', 'respectable', 'horror', 'films', '/', 'ghost', 'stories', 'one', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'last', 'year', '*The', 'Sixth', 'Sense*', '*Stir', 'Echoes*', 'deliver', 'handful', 'quality', 'scares', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'ghostly', 'visitations', 'not', 'look', 'ridiculous.But', 'something', 'missing', 'here', 'perhaps', 'something', 'ADDED', 'unwelcome', 'Namely', 'presence', 'Big', 'Guns', 'i.e.', 'A-list', 'actors', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'A-list', 'director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'What', 'ADDED', 'what', 'missing', 'course', 'originality', 'daring', 'unusual', 'presence', 'million-dollar', 'celebrities', 'almost', 'guarantees', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'conventional', 'will', 'cozy', 'up', 'safe', 'cliches', 'well-worn', 'storylines', 'will', 'vastly', 'serve', 'said', 'celebrities', 'egos', '*What', 'Lies', 'Beneath*', 'exception', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'recent', 'collaborations', 'talented', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'exception', 'merely', 'rule', 'Zemeckis', 'certainly', 'Big', 'Guns', 'feature', 'Pfeiffer', 'Ford', 'live', 'Martha', 'Stewart', '/', 'Ethan', 'Allan', '/', 'shabby-chic', 'Vermont', 'Martha', 'Stewart', '/', 'etc', 'home', 'Not', 'content', 'have', 'main', 'characters', 'be', 'business', 'people', 'doctors', 'something', 'screenwriters', 'give', 'glamorous', 'careers', 'geneticist', 'former', 'cellist', 'Pfeiffer', 'first', 'husband', 'also', 'musician', 'died', 'years', 'ago', 'new', 'marriage', 'rock-solid', 'Ford', 'little', 'off-balance', 'i.e.', 'ripe', 'visitation', 'ghost', 'Incidentally', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'say', 'two', 'principals', 'have', 'chemistry', 'two', 'icebergs', 'passing', 'night', 'Mr.', 'Ford', 'non-emotive', 'rather', 'sullen', 'muttering', 'style', 'acting', 'lately', 'perfected', 'Pfeiffer', 'vaguely', 'ticked', 'off', 'certainly', 'HUNGRY', 'woman', 'gain', '10', 'pounds', '.OK', 'so', 'forget', 'characterizations', 'what', 'plot', 'Well', 'less', 'said', 'better', 'movie', 'quot', 'surprise', 'ending', 'quot', 'la', '*The', 'Sixth', 'Sense*', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'quot', 'crisis-stretch', 'quot', 'not', 'only', 'too', 'long', 'also', 'ghost', 'drowned', 'woman', 'haunted', 'Pfeiffer', 'Claire', 'whole', 'movie', 'almost', 'irrelevant', 'finish', 'movie', 'saying', 'quot', 'Was', 'ghost', 'really', 'necessary', 'quot', 'typical', 'Zemeckis', 'who', 'exciting', 'plots', 'logical', 'ones']",What Lies Beneath VHS

526220,ABQPBY4VNK40Y,B00003CXI6,Karl Flaig,"[7, 14]","Harrison Ford's choices have been slipping more and more every year.  &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; hopefully is rock-bottom for Ford.  The same can be said of director Robert Zemeckis, because if either of them can make a worse movie there should be some kind of criminal punishment.So why is &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; so atrociously bad?  Well the movie spends over an hour on a red herring, bad &quot;Rear Window&quot; take-off that has absolutely nothing to do with the remaining, painfully stupid last hour.  You see, after the movie's first hour exercise in wasteful moviemaking ends, we're treated to a trite, predictable and not the least bit creative or chilling ghost story that's got the depth of your average Scooby Doo episode.We get a ghost who can turn on the computer and type, yet for no reason (beyond shoddy writing) fails to merely type a letter explaining who she is, why she's in the house and what she wants done to avenge her death.  As if it's not obvious anyway!  But of course the stupidity builds because the ghost always writes on mirrors, but rather than writing useful information the ghost scribbles cryptic gems such as &quot;You Know&quot;.  Oh, scary.  Eek.  Why not write: &quot;So-and-so killed me; that person put my body here.&quot;?Not to be outdone by the silly ghost story and bad &quot;Rear Window&quot; copycatting, we get ALL the dumb horror/thriller cliches.  The characters never turn around until it's too late.  The killer appears to be unconcious but isn't (wow, shocking!).  People all seem to enjoy creeping up on loved ones and then just standing behind them...we know how much fun that is.  But the absolute kicker would be the stupid plot devices, such as the chemical that paralyzes but doesn't kill...this sets up the most asinine tub sequence ever.

526226,A26IJ3A2TRQZAO,B00003CXI6,Kayla,"[3, 4]","Here's another textbook example of a film's preview giving away too much of its plot.  What Lies Beneath is a full three-quarters over before you get to the content revealed in the trailer.  Fortunately, it doesn't much matter - Beneath is a taut psychological thriller that would make Hitchcock proud.  In fact, it could do for bathtubs what Hitch's Psycho did for showers.Beneath features Harrison Ford (Random Hearts) and Michelle Pfeiffer (The Story of Us), two stars with box office clout fading faster than the Baltimore Orioles' chance at a playoff berth.  They play Dr. Norman and Claire Spencer, a genetic biologist and an ex-concert cellist, respectively.  They live in a picturesque waterfront Vermont home that was formerly owned by Norman's recently deceased father.While Norman is completely consumed by his work, Claire stays at home and begins to experience strange and spooky stuff in their new house.  It's your typical poltergeist fare - doors opening on their own, pictures crashing to the floor - but nobody's sure if it's just Claire suffering from Empty Nest Syndrome (her only daughter just left for college) or if she's really experiencing some type of otherworldly force.  And if Claire is being haunted by an apparition, whose ghost is it?  Norman's dead father or perhaps the Spencers' new neighbor, who Claire believes was murdered?  In an homage to Hitchcock's Rear Window, Claire thinks she sees her body being removed from the house one night in the pouring rain.  Like I said, if you've seen the trailer, you already know the answer.Claire also seems to be suffering from selective amnesia, forgetting important events that happened in her life, especially those surrounding a social event where Norman was awarded a Chair at a prestigious University.  The whole role kind of reminded me of Emma Thompson in Kenneth Branagh's wonderful Dead Again.  Claire has to piece her own life back together with virtually no help from her unsympathetic husband, who seems to only care that her kookiness is inconveniencing his career.There are about a dozen jump-out-of-your-skin moments in Beneath.  You can see most of them coming, but they're so well done that it doesn't matter.  The ending is very maddening and takes so long to develop (about thirty minutes) that people at my screening nearly became physically ill.  I can't ever recall being at a film before and hearing a group of men shouting out loud in fear or a woman shrieking at the top of her lungs. Beneath is a terrific popcorn thriller that plays better than The Sixth Sense and its sucker-punch ending.  Just don't eat too much popcorn.Pfeiffer gives one of her best performances ever, but Ford has just turned into a really bad actor.  He's becoming more and more like Frankenstein with each film he makes.  I'm not sure if he's actually wooden or just grumpy.  Even Beneath's tagline could be interpreted as a poke at the fifty-eight-year-old actor - ""He was the perfect husband until his one mistake followed them home.""  What was it?  Sabrina?  Six Days, Seven Nights?  Random Hearts?  It doesn't matter - when Ford takes off his shirt, studio executives roll around in money like Demi Moore in Indecent Proposal.Director Robert Zemeckis (Contact) fills Beneath with a bunch of technically dazzling long shots, some of which left me scratching my head and wanting to see the film again.  He's one of the better mainstream directors out there, and the fact that Zemeckis and crew are able to sustain such a level of sheer terror for the last thirty minutes is a real testament to the director and the script, which was written by Clark Gregg.  Beneath is Gregg's debut screenplay, but he's appeared in a myriad of films with amazing scripts (Magnolia, The Usual Suspects, The Spanish Prisoner) and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award last year for his performance in The Adventures of Sebastian Cole.Zemeckis, who won an Oscar for Forrest Gump, reassembled his top-notch crew for Beneath (namely, editor Arthur Schmidt, cinematographer Don Burgess, score-meister Alan Silvestri and production designer Rick Carter - all Oscar nominees for Gump).  They do a fantastic job of making a beautiful lakefront home seem warm, cozy and inviting, as well as creepy, ominous and terrifying.  Beneath is the first of two potential blockbusters helmed by Zemeckis this year - Cast Away, which re-teams the director with Gump star Tom Hanks, is set to be released this Christmas.",5,Do You Already Know Qhat Lies Beneath?,990748800,"05 25, 2001",2001,4471,"['Here', 'textbook', 'example', 'film', 'preview', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'What', 'Beneath', 'full', 'three-quarters', 'get', 'content', 'revealed', 'trailer', 'Fortunately', ""n't"", 'much', 'matter', 'Beneath', 'taut', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'would', 'make', 'Hitchcock', 'proud', 'fact', 'could', 'do', 'bathtubs', 'what', 'Hitch', 'Psycho', 'did', 'showers.Beneath', 'features', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Random', 'Hearts', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Story', 'Us', 'two', 'stars', 'box', 'office', 'clout', 'fading', 'faster', 'Baltimore', 'Orioles', 'chance', 'playoff', 'berth', 'play', 'Dr.', 'Norman', 'Claire', 'Spencer', 'genetic', 'biologist', 'ex-concert', 'cellist', 'respectively', 'live', 'picturesque', 'waterfront', 'Vermont', 'home', 'was', 'formerly', 'owned', 'Norman', 'recently', 'deceased', 'father.While', 'Norman', 'completely', 'consumed', 'work', 'Claire', 'home', 'experience', 'strange', 'spooky', 'stuff', 'new', 'house', 'typical', 'poltergeist', 'fare', 'doors', 'opening', 'own', 'crashing', 'floor', 'nobody', 'sure', 'just', 'Claire', 'suffering', 'Empty', 'Nest', 'Syndrome', 'only', 'daughter', 'just', 'left', 'college', 'really', 'experiencing', 'type', 'otherworldly', 'force', 'Claire', 'being', 'haunted', 'apparition', 'ghost', 'Norman', 'dead', 'father', 'perhaps', 'Spencers', 'new', 'neighbor', 'who', 'Claire', 'was', 'murdered', 'homage', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Claire', 'body', 'being', 'removed', 'house', 'one', 'night', 'pouring', 'rain', 'said', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'already', 'know', 'answer.Claire', 'also', 'be', 'suffering', 'selective', 'amnesia', 'forgetting', 'important', 'events', 'happened', 'life', 'especially', 'surrounding', 'social', 'event', 'where', 'Norman', 'was', 'awarded', 'Chair', 'prestigious', 'University', 'whole', 'role', 'kind', 'reminded', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'wonderful', 'Dead', 'Again', 'Claire', 'piece', 'own', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'virtually', 'help', 'unsympathetic', 'husband', 'who', 'only', 'care', 'kookiness', 'inconveniencing', 'career.There', 'are', 'dozen', 'jump-out-of-your-skin', 'moments', 'Beneath', 'can', 'see', 'most', 'coming', ""'re"", 'so', 'well', 'done', ""n't"", 'matter', 'ending', 'very', 'maddening', 'so', 'long', 'develop', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'people', 'screening', 'nearly', 'became', 'physically', 'ill', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'recall', 'being', 'film', 'hearing', 'group', 'men', 'shouting', 'out', 'loud', 'fear', 'woman', 'shrieking', 'top', 'lungs', 'Beneath', 'terrific', 'popcorn', 'thriller', 'better', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'sucker-punch', 'ending', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', 'too', 'much', 'popcorn.Pfeiffer', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'Ford', 'just', 'turned', 'really', 'bad', 'actor', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'Frankenstein', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'actually', 'wooden', 'just', 'grumpy', 'Even', 'Beneath', 'tagline', 'could', 'be', 'interpreted', 'poke', 'fifty-eight-year-old', 'actor', 'was', 'perfect', 'husband', 'one', 'mistake', 'followed', 'home', 'What', 'was', 'Sabrina', 'Six', 'Days', 'Seven', 'Nights', 'Random', 'Hearts', ""n't"", 'matter', 'when', 'Ford', 'shirt', 'studio', 'executives', 'roll', 'around', 'money', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Indecent', 'Proposal.Director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Contact', 'Beneath', 'bunch', 'technically', 'dazzling', 'long', 'shots', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'wanting', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'one', 'better', 'mainstream', 'directors', 'there', 'fact', 'Zemeckis', 'crew', 'are', 'able', 'sustain', 'such', 'level', 'sheer', 'terror', 'last', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'real', 'testament', 'director', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'Beneath', 'Gregg', 'debut', 'screenplay', 'appeared', 'myriad', 'films', 'amazing', 'scripts', 'Magnolia', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'was', 'nominated', 'Independent', 'Spirit', 'Award', 'last', 'year', 'performance', 'Adventures', 'Sebastian', 'Cole.Zemeckis', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'reassembled', 'top-notch', 'crew', 'Beneath', 'namely', 'editor', 'Arthur', 'Schmidt', 'cinematographer', 'Don', 'Burgess', 'score-meister', 'Alan', 'Silvestri', 'production', 'designer', 'Rick', 'Carter', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Gump', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'making', 'beautiful', 'lakefront', 'home', 'seem', 'warm', 'cozy', 'inviting', 'as', 'well', 'creepy', 'ominous', 'terrifying', 'Beneath', 'first', 'two', 'potential', 'blockbusters', 'helmed', 'Zemeckis', 'year', 'Cast', 'Away', 're-teams', 'director', 'Gump', 'star', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'set', 'be', 'released', 'Christmas']",What Lies Beneath VHS

The general idea is that Ford and Pfeiffer have a visitor in their home by the lake.  Pfeiffer thinks it's the neighbor's wife, whom she believed was murdered.  Ford thinks his wife is losing it.  Scares galore follow, and a twist and turn ending comes to fruition.The scares in this movie aren't of the ""hack-and-slash"" gore variety.  They aren't even the ""boo!"" scares found in horror flicks as of late such as ""The Grudge.""  They are legitimate, bite-your-nails scary.  There are some of the jump-at-ya type scares, but they are pulled off in a way that tells you that this movie stands out from the pack.  It works on your mind while you're trying to solve who the ghost is, then hits you with a wallop of surprises.  In other words, you're always trying to be on your guard, but you are never given a chance to recover.I base how scary a film is on how it affects me after I've watched it.  This flick made me uneasy when I went to the bathtub.  It made me want to turn on every light.  When a movie does that to me, it deserves four stars.

Gittins,"[2, 2]","This is director Robert Zemeckis' attempt at a Hitchcock-like suspense movie.Unfortunately, much of the suspense comes from the old tried-and-true suspense movie conventions of walking backward so you don't see what is in plain view; over-reactive fumbling and bumbling and dropping important things; and the intrusive musical cues.However, like all Zemekis' movies, this one contains some impressive camera moves and special effects, which include shooting upward through a glass floor.The acting was pretty good throughout, and most of the success of the movie is due to Michelle Pfieffer's performance. Harrison Ford was good, and played a bit against type.The movie left a few loose ends untied (such as the situation with the neighbors, and some visions and apparitions), had a few lapses in logic and reality (yeah, I know it's a ghost movie) such as the boat mast poking a hole in the windshield though not breaking it, and some of it was a bit too convenient (one accident at the exact location of a previous accident), and the final scene felt tacked on (think how nicely ambiguous it would be if what lies beneath just sank past the camera...)Overall, the movie is pretty good and entertaining, and though it started off strong, it tapered off a bit as it got into the second half.DVD extras include a commentary by Zemeckis and 2 producers, a brief documentary of (mostly other) Zemeckis movies, and text-based cast/crew info.",4,Weak 4 stars for Original Yet Conventional movie,1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,1437,"['director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'attempt', 'Hitchcock-like', 'suspense', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'much', 'suspense', 'old', 'tried-and-true', 'suspense', 'movie', 'conventions', 'walking', 'backward', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'plain', 'view', 'over-reactive', 'fumbling', 'bumbling', 'dropping', 'important', 'things', 'intrusive', 'musical', 'cues.However', 'Zemekis', 'movies', 'one', 'impressive', 'camera', 'moves', 'special', 'effects', 'include', 'shooting', 'upward', 'glass', 'floor.The', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'most', 'success', 'movie', 'due', 'Michelle', 'Pfieffer', 'performance', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'was', 'good', 'played', 'bit', 'type.The', 'movie', 'left', 'few', 'loose', 'ends', 'untied', 'such', 'situation', 'neighbors', 'visions', 'apparitions', 'had', 'few', 'lapses', 'logic', 'reality', 'yeah', 'know', 'ghost', 'movie', 'such', 'boat', 'mast', 'poking', 'hole', 'windshield', 'not', 'breaking', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'convenient', 'one', 'accident', 'exact', 'location', 'previous', 'accident', 'final', 'scene', 'felt', 'tacked', 'think', 'how', 'nicely', 'ambiguous', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'beneath', 'just', 'sank', 'camera', 'Overall', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'entertaining', 'started', 'off', 'strong', 'tapered', 'off', 'bit', 'got', 'second', 'half.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'Zemeckis', '2', 'producers', 'brief', 'documentary', 'mostly', 'other', 'Zemeckis', 'movies', 'text-based', 'cast/crew', 'info']",What Lies Beneath VHS

526252,A3P738KVXL2YYM,B00003CXI6,Mary Chrapliwy,"[0, 0]","I have seen this movie both in the theater and on DVD at home. First off, my daughter and I went to see the movie together in the theater. Let's just say there are a couple scenes we both screamed at in unison with other theater goers.  It's not exactly a horror movie and there are no blood and guts, there are just some tremendously alarming scenes. Don't let kids under 13 see this movie if possible.  When the DVD came out my husband and I purchased it as did a couple we know. Both of us couples watched it the same night in different houses -- the women (my friend and I) reacted much the same as my daughter and I had in the theater. Our husbands' reaction was sort of ho hum -- neither of them enjoyed it as much as they anticipated they would. So perhaps it's a woman's movie? Though I have a brother who loved it, so maybe it's not...Other than my assessment that this movie is a great one, based on my experience, I can't say more because it would give away too much of the plot.  Let's just say, a friend of mine saw it before me and asked if I'd seen it. When she found out I hadn't seen it yet she refused to discuss any part of it because she thought she would spoil it for me -- and she would have.  I don't want to spoil it for you, so I can't say more about it.

526253,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXI6,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","I missed What Lies Beneath when it first arrived in theaters, and because of some negative press, as well as the comments of some friends, I expected the worst when I popped the movie into my player. I wound up having a lot of fun with this big budget, old-fashioned thriller which is designed solely to entertain. I suspect that many of those who were disappointed by it felt that, because it has such a famous and talented director and cast, it should have served some higher purpose. Or it could be that their plot hole threshold is lower than mine, for it is true that a lot of what goes on in the movie isn't all that believable. Still, part of what drives great movie making is, frankly, the ability either to rise above or to gloss over any script deficiencies, and I think the film mainly succeeds in doing this. It has been said that What Lies Beneath became a huge hit just because it came out at time when there was little product out for adult audiences, yet it could not have become such a success if a lot of people hadn't enjoy it.Claire and Norman Spencer seem to be a very happily married couple. He is a successful doctor doing genetic research at a prestigious university in Vermont. She is a musician who seemingly put aside a promising career in order to be the perfect wife and mother. When the couple's only daughter goes off the college, Claire is left alone much of the time in their magnificent lakeside home. Her husband and her friends are worried about her for reasons that become clear later on. It turns out that they have cause to be concerned, for soon she begins to have some frightening hallucinations about a young woman who appears to be dead. When the woman next-door disappears, Claire becomes convinced that she has been murdered and begins to investigate the woman's husband. Norman becomes increasingly concerned and frightened by Claire's behavior. This is only the beginning of a mystery that takes the audience on a wild ride that questions what is real and what isn't. Are the things Claire sees real or things she imagines? Does she really see a ghost or is it a demon inside her trying to reveal a terrible truth?Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford are perfect as Claire and Norman. This role is a welcome departure, as well as a good career move, for Mr. Ford, but it is basically Ms. Pfeiffer's movie. She has never been more beautiful nor vulnerable. In the hands of a lesser actress, Claire might have come off as laughingly neurotic, but Ms. Pfeiffer magically turns her into someone we can both relate to and root for. It's a role that's tougher than it looks, and the star makes the most of it.What Lies Beneath is beautifully visualized. It is full of water imagery, water which at times acts as a force to hide the truth and, at another times, as a mirror to reflect it. This imagery doesn't make the movie any deeper, but it does make it lovely to look at.This picture recalls some of the work of Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock was the master of suspense, and, while What Lies Beneath in no way equals the best of his movies, it shares with them the idea that the ultimate goal of any good thriller is to entertain its audience. And for me, this movie did that. I suspect that some, but not all, of the criticism this movie has received may be based on a bit of intellectual snobbery. It is certainly not a work of art, but the great magic of cinema is that it can produce an infinate variety of movies. There is room in this world for all of them, and I for one like it that way, because a steady diet of any one particular type would soon become stale.",4,Implauisble? Of course! Entertaining?

I had heard a lot of opinions about Harrison Ford's character being hard to accept.  I finally broke down and rented WLB and I'm not sorry that I did.I really couldn't stand Michelle Pfieffer's character, who is a bored little homemaker with too much time on her hands and a very nosy disposition.  However, my reaction to her character was due to some good acting on her part.  Pfieffer really did a good job bringing out her character's more annoying and compulsive behaviors.Harrison Ford's character is a departure from what he usually plays and may be a little hard to swallow but who says he always has to play the hero or adventurer.  He wasn't great but he wasn't bad either.  Just have an open mind.The plot itself was pretty good.  When the supernatural things start happening, the movie gets pretty freaky.

Plus, I've been told this film isn't that great.I was pleasantly surprised how scared I was watching this film. You'd think after a while you would be desensitised after watching a lot of horror films, but I jumped loads, and after it had finished, insisted on switching on all the lights in the house. And then I was too scared to go to sleep. Never has a film affected me as badly as this did.I'm not much of a fan of Harrison Ford, but loving Michelle Pfeffer. She is such an amazing actress, and I noticed it most in this film. It's all in the eyes with her in this, especially in the bathtub scenes. She manages to portray so much just through her eyes, and it's brilliant. Most actresses would probably fail miserably at this, but she does it well.The film severely drags in the middle however, and for me, this stopped me giving it a higher rating. It starts well, it ends well, it doesn't work so well in the middle. Robert Zemeckis could have easily trimmed this by half an hour, and made it a much better movie. Nothing much happens in the middle, apart from some boring stuff with an Ouija board, and that's about it.It's not up to scratch as some of the other movies that Robert Zemeckis has done, including the fabulous Back To The Future trilogy, Castaway (this was entirely filmed during on the break on the film) and Who Filmed Roger Rabbit being some of his best.If you can, pick up this film for cheap (which you should be able to now), cos you'll regret it.

526256,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00003CXI6,Michael Butts,"[5, 5]","Yes, Harrison Ford receives top billing, and he does a creditable job in his role as stuffy professor Norman Spencer.  But, let's face it---this movie belongs to the superb Michelle Pfeiffer, in an overlooked, should have been Oscar nominated performance.  Michelle portrays Norman's wife, Clare, a woman who has seemingly had a difficult year since a strange auto accident the year before the movie starts.  First thing you know she's sure that their new neighbor has killed his bizzare wife.  And, what's worse, a ghost is haunting Michelle, and she's sure it's the wife's ghost that's doing it.Aha...that's just the start.  Robert Zemeckis, like Brian DePalma, pays homage to the great Alfred Hitchcock in this really spooky film.  Unlike DePalma, however, Zemeckis doesn't copy Hitch, but translates his style into Zemecki's own.  It's a brilliant directorial effort, again worthy of an Oscar nomination.  Diana Scarwid as Jody, Clare's friend, is also superb in a supporting role, bringing a little bit of humor and pizzazz to Clare's spooky life.The plot twists and turns, in spite of the movie's trailer revealing something it shouldn't have, but it still works, thanks to the dominance of Pfeiffer in the leading role.  Her &quot;possession&quot; by the ghost reveals a sensual sexiness few actresses can pull off as convincingly.The visual effects are stunning, and the last thirty minutes or so of the movie is spine-tingling in its intensity.

He is a prominent scientist, she's an ex musician that just left her only daughter at college. Free time takes Mrs. Spencer to spy on her neighbors, and from that activity she believes that a crime has been perpetrated next door. Insecure and nervous, Claire's paranoia grows as a series of paranormal events take place in her perfect home: doors open and close, electrical equipment turn on automatically, spectral visions in the bathtub. Are all these things related? That's one of the many secrets the movie hides.A lonely home, secrets trying to be revealed, darkness, ghosts and the impending sensation that we are not sure what our eyes are seeing, What Lies Beneath has enough elements to hook you up for a scary time. Zemeckis takes advantage from every trick, cliche and ideas to spice the story, until he leaves us with a terrible deja vu sensation. The result is a supernatural thriller cleverly built, part psychological, part ghost story.And one could very well wonder, when Michelle Pfeiffer sees a spectral reflex on the water, if the ghost we are seeing is indeed Mr Hitchcock.As soon as the credits vanish, we take a walk from moments of Rear Window, Suspicion, Vertigo and even Psycho. The cinematic references overwhelm us, from the lead man's name, the disturbing music score, the movie's rhythm, the creepy house alone on a hill. Hitch's fans will enjoy tremendously this tributePfeiffer and Ford are two stars talented and very charismatic, whose performances give more depth to the story. Pfeiffer, above all, is very convincing as the housewife victim of a series of inexplicable events. Her terror and her pain are very truthful. Ford is somewhat relegated to a second place.In the end, the secrets that hide What Lies Beneath are not so interesting. The excess of subplots, tributes and tricks make the movie into a series of brilliant moments that are bigger than the whole. For the entertaining time, we can thank Zemeckis.

526262,A1HCHMYMPO97CL,B00003CXI6,M. J. Dirou,"[5, 5]","What Lies Beneath is a stylish supernatural thriller that guarantees the viewer to be kept anxiously on the edge of their seat. Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford provide the star power for this ghost story with a twist and as well as making a most attractive all American (supposedly ideal) couple, do a good job of driving the dramatic tension and suspense along with suitable pace and expression. Another very stylish star of this film is its setting and design. The stately, Vermont, lake side home, provides a visual feast and perfect setting and atmosphere for a haunting. In particular the somewhat gothic looking Victorian style bathroom, with its deep old fashioned bathtub. Along with the lake it provides the focus for much of the film's pivotal action and creepy apparitions. Adding to its classy set design and camera direction, is some very tight and creative editing which pulls the story and drama together in a fluid montage of scenes that unravel the plot in a timely and appropriate way. If the first half of the film seems a little drawn out, then I think it needs to be to in order to provide an effective depiction of Claire's gradual and frightening revelations. It also provides suitable build up and contrast to the final more melodramtic, action packed terror at the films climax. The original musical score played throughout the film is also suitably chilling and atmospheric in all the right places.This (along with 'Frantic') is one of Harrison Ford's best performances in my view. There is a disturbing naturalness in the way he disguises and then later attempts to justify his character 'Norman's' past deeds, that seems very realistic. Michelle Pfeiffer, who carries the majority of the film, is also very good but at times comes close to being in 'over acting territory' in that some of her reactions and expressions appear a little posed somehow. She always has presence however, and her face in all its chiselled, classic beauty, was made for the big screen. How does a woman clothed and submerged in a filled bathtub manage to look that beautiful I ask you?Even though I know what's coming I can still watch this movie many times just to take in the stylishly chilling atmosphere and setting, shot against the backdrop of that magnificent house and lake.",4,Stylish Supernatural Thriller,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,2291,"['What', 'Beneath', 'stylish', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'viewer', 'be', 'kept', 'anxiously', 'edge', 'seat', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'provide', 'star', 'power', 'ghost', 'story', 'twist', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'most', 'attractive', 'American', 'supposedly', 'ideal', 'couple', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'driving', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'suspense', 'suitable', 'pace', 'expression', 'very', 'stylish', 'star', 'film', 'setting', 'design', 'stately', 'Vermont', 'lake', 'side', 'home', 'visual', 'feast', 'perfect', 'setting', 'atmosphere', 'haunting', 'particular', 'somewhat', 'gothic', 'looking', 'Victorian', 'style', 'bathroom', 'deep', 'old', 'fashioned', 'bathtub', 'lake', 'focus', 'much', 'film', 'pivotal', 'action', 'creepy', 'apparitions', 'Adding', 'classy', 'set', 'design', 'camera', 'direction', 'very', 'tight', 'creative', 'editing', 'story', 'drama', 'together', 'fluid', 'montage', 'scenes', 'unravel', 'plot', 'timely', 'appropriate', 'way', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'little', 'drawn', 'then', 'think', 'be', 'order', 'provide', 'effective', 'depiction', 'Claire', 'gradual', 'frightening', 'revelations', 'also', 'suitable', 'build', 'up', 'contrast', 'final', 'more', 'melodramtic', 'action', 'packed', 'terror', 'films', 'climax', 'original', 'musical', 'score', 'played', 'film', 'also', 'suitably', 'chilling', 'atmospheric', 'right', 'places.This', ""'Frantic"", 'one', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'best', 'performances', 'view', 'disturbing', 'naturalness', 'way', 'then', 'later', 'attempts', 'justify', 'character', ""'Norman"", 'past', 'deeds', 'very', 'realistic', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'who', 'majority', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'times', 'close', 'being', ""'over"", 'acting', 'territory', 'reactions', 'expressions', 'appear', 'little', 'posed', 'somehow', 'always', 'presence', 'however', 'face', 'chiselled', 'classic', 'beauty', 'was', 'made', 'big', 'screen', 'How', 'woman', 'clothed', 'submerged', 'filled', 'bathtub', 'manage', 'look', 'beautiful', 'ask', 'Even', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'can', 'still', 'watch', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'just', 'take', 'stylishly', 'chilling', 'atmosphere', 'setting', 'shot', 'backdrop', 'magnificent', 'house', 'lake']",What Lies Beneath VHS

I've always enjoyed Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, but wondered what this movie was all about.  I was pleasently surprised, as it was far better than I thought it would be, and I didn't anticipate the twists and turns.Harrison and Michelle play Norman and Claire Spencer, a happily married couple who are adjusting to their new positions in life.  Their daughter has just gone off to college, and they are now pseudo empty nesters.  While Norman still has his work as a college professor, Claire finds herself a bit bored.  Their new next door neighbors have become an object of fascination, as they have passionate fights and reconciliation.  Clarie eventually becomes convinced that the husband murdered his wife when she sees some strange things in the middle of the night.  After attempting to contact spirits on the Ouija board and some odd goings on here and there, Claire becomes convinced that the wife's ghost is trying to communicate with her.  When she confronts the neighbor, he explains, once his wife appears at his side, that he didn't kill his wife.  Embarrassed, Claire leaves with her tail between her legs, thinking it's just some paranoid fantasy.But there really is a spirit trying to connect with her, just one not in association with the neighbors.  It's of a university student who disappeared last year named Madison.  Who Norman had an affair with.  Who Claire walked in on, ran away in shock, had a car accident, bumped her head, and forgot about.It's a juicy tale, to be sure.  It's a good, old school kind of thriller, without blood and guts, and keeps the suspense going until the very end.

The ghost genre inevitably came next, but fared somewhat better.  Take 'The Sixth Sense' and 'House On Haunted Hill' for example, both well above your average scary movie.  Now this film sold itself on the basis that it was an 'adult' horror movie.  By that it simply meant old-fashioned, for supposed teen flicks such as 'Scream' were actually far more intelligent.  This is just sophisticated.Still, it's nice to see a movie where Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer manage to move away from type-casting and prove that they can both act.  Also impressive is the fact that director Zemeckis filmed this whilst on a hiatus from his other film 'Castaway'.  Unfortunately though, it drags a lot at the start.  After things hot up a little you'll be at the edge of your seat but for a long while it's a little dull.  Of course, this was passed off as being adult and a great tension-builder and no-one dared say anything.  It was just kep quiet about whilst everyone raved about the ending.If you're not accustomed to the genre then this is probably a really good start to ghost movies.  But there are far better ones out there and this is little more than ordinary.  In fact, it is only really a fantastic turn by Pfeiffer that makes it anything special.

526278,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,B00003CXI6,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","It's a shame that when this movie was released, half the audience already knew what was going to happen because of the stupidity of trailers. Promotional material gave too much away too fast, probably to the angst of director Zemeckis (Death becomes her, Demon Knight, Castaway producer). A thriller it certainly is, and a mystery it was supposed to be, but oh well. The plot is simple enough - Claire is a middle aged and seemingly perfect housewife who's a bit too dependant on the happiness of family. Her only child has left the house and her best friend and scientist husband rattle off a concern for her well-being. Apparently dear ol' Claire attempted suicide a year before (she swears it was an accident), and she must constantly reassure her family and friends that she's fine.Her husband isn't all that perfect, of course, instead being a workaholic who's rather self-absorbed and a loner. Her best friend attempts to be the understanding sound board but her superficial personality shows through. Both play the standard roles with no huge surprises (even the ending if you think about it) Nothing beyond generic here, so it's up to the actors to make the roles interesting. They do. Pfeiffer is an amazing actress who deserves big kudos for her performance in this, that, and everything in between. She manages to create in Claire a sublime blend of vulnerability, nativity, intelligence, and strength. She doesn't overact, which is a good thing in a horror film as that's usually the tendency of heroines. Her motivations aren't particularly stupid, either, although there are some cheap scare tactics used, but this can't necessarily be blamed on her alone. Ford makes every role his own as always, and as Norman plays the traditionally boring husband whose seen as perfect when he may not be (they never are).As a thriller, it blusters rehashed, generic material that's lost its effect. The red herring was a nod to Hitchcock's Rear Window and could have been an intriguing plot device if followed up on, yet when it becomes painfully clear that it is what it is and nothing more, the audience is less than amused. We even get the dependable, standard Ouija board, doors opening by themselves, and steamed mirrors with written messages. Sadly nothing new here, but it's still workable material if the other elements are done right.What's more interesting about this movie is the underlying emphasis on the psychological. The vision of the perfect couple and 'what lies beneath'. We are led to believe Claire is nearly perfect - she's beautiful, she plays the violin like a goddess, she's an amazing mother, sympathetic and understanding wife, good friend and member of the community, trying neighbor, and physically fit, healthy middle-aged citizen. However, of course there's always more underneath this exterior, but unfortunately we don't get many answers other than she's possibly too dependant and fragile. The husband is easier to spot as a wolf in sheep's clothing, but again they follow the traditional blame of her husband on the wife's condition and the stereotypical downfalls of the man 'slipping up.'Zemeckis, a long time Hitchcock fan, employs the use of the dead directors tricks and tips of the trade frequently. As mentioned before, Rear Window is nodded to, including the use of binoculars at the peeping neighbor. We get a tribute to Psycho with pulled down shower curtains.If the trailers hadn't given so much away, perhaps the mystery would have made this one a winner. The clues are laid out rather clearly early on, though, so it's not hard to surmise what's going to happen. It could be another example of Hollywood seeing people as dumb cattle grazing in the fields, feeling like they have to spoon feed us everything. Ok, we get it already, stop with the hints! Midway the script falters, not seeming to know where it wants to head. Plot lines are dropped and there just really isn't much there besides tensions and scenarios we've seen so many time before already.What Lies Beneath boasted a promising cast and intriguing premise, yet managed to fail anyway. It's nothing beyond generic and retrograded material. There are numerous Hitchcock references, but nodding to better pictures doesn't create an endearing film.

Its not possible. But being a fan of huge movies life, `rear window' and `the burbs' I just kind of felt let down by the plot. It didn't have the edge that hitchcock injected into the James Stewart classic and it didn't have the intrigue and suspense of hanks in the burbs. It was almost to manufactured. All the old horror moments are in there, the weak lady frightened is left alone in the house with whatever it is that is frightening her etc. But what does save this movie is the perfect mix of the `thriller' type moments, the jumps that you know are coming, as she backs up to an open door, are brilliantly mixed with the ones that you have no idea about! All in all it makes for a great ride but there is a but.Ford, if ford, and he will always be Han solo/ Indiana Jones. But his performance is worthy of his title. His mix of moods blends in with the up and down structure of the movie. Pfeiffer is great, although she usually is. She's cool, sexy and smart as has no trouble dealing with the demands of her particular role.Although most of the entire film is set in the house Dreamworks have gone out of their way to make this house special. The multi-door bathroom sets the atmosphere for the crucial scenes that occur in the tub, the mirrors are just fantastic, all the way through the mirrors remind us of the parallels that make the story interesting, the links between the victim and Pfeiffer etc.A great disc all in all, the sound is amazing and the jumps are even worse when you can see every detail.

Zemeckis flips the rule on its head. Deapits hearing uniformly awful things about this film, Zemeckis' last blip on my radar was &#34;Robert Zemeckis Presents The Frighteners,&#34; Peter Jackson's insanely underrated comedy, and so I figured I'd give him another chance, Forrest Gump notwithstanding. Unfortunately, rubbing shoulders with Peter Jackson hasn't done a blessed thing for Zemeckis, a wonderful director gone horribly downhill.This is the latest piece of evidence that Zemeckis seems to have gone completely insane. It starts slowly, all well and good for a horror film, but the pace never picks up. Michelle Pfeiffer tries to convey the mixed emotions in a woman who's not sure whether she's actually living in a haunted house, or whether (as everyone around her seems to believe) she's just relapsing into suicidal depression. Problem is that no one else in the movie is believable enough to lend any credence to her otherwise pretty good performance. Even the usually-wonderful Diana Scarwid doesn't manage to make a dent here as Pfeiffer's wacko-spiritualist pal.Fear not, folks. For his next film, Macabre, Zemeckis teams up with Joel Silver, with whom he hasn't worked since his last truly great film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

Zwick,"[3, 4]","The biggest challenge facing a genre picture like &#8220;What Lies Beneath&#8221; is to be able to cover well-worn territory without making us feel as if we&#8217;ve seen it all before. This film doesn&#8217;t exactly succeed in doing so, but it does offer a few impressive set pieces as compensation. &#8220;What Lies Beneath&#8221; borrows heavily from movies like &#8220;Rebecca&#8221; and &#8220;Psycho,&#8221; adding generous helpings of &#8220;Rear Window&#8221; and &#8220;Wait Until Dark&#8221; to the mix for good measure. .... It does an effective job at the beginning when it is setting up the scenario, injecting just enough ambiguity into the proceedings to make us question whether Claire is truly seeing what she thinks she is seeing or whether she is suffering from delusions brought on by mental instability. Unfortunately, once that issue is decided for us, the film loses some of its intriguing quality and becomes a more standard issue horror film. Moreover, the major plot &#8220;twist&#8221; is one we can pretty much predict five minutes into the film. Given its weaknesses, &#8220;What Lies Beneath&#8221; delivers the goods for those who want nothing more than a relaxing, goosepimply good time at the movies. Director Robert Zemeckis, though he appears to be slumming here a bit, knows how to shoot an effective jump-out-of-your-seat suspense sequence &#8211; although he does tend to rely overmuch on the &#8220;false scare&#8221; technique that seems to be so popular in films of this type. As to the acting, Ford pretty much walks through his part, surely dreaming of better things to come in the role department, but Pfeiffer manages to bring a dignity and depth to a character that could easily have degenerated into the hysterical wife stereotype. &#8220;What Lies Beneath&#8221; is an effective time killer provided you realize beforehand that the answer to the film&#8217;s title is: &#8220;Not much.&#8221;",3,tolerable time waster,998697600,"08 25, 2001",2001,1941,"['biggest', 'challenge', 'facing', 'genre', 'picture', '8220', 'What', 'Beneath', '8221', 'be', 'able', 'cover', 'well-worn', 'territory', 'making', 'feel', '8217', 've', 'seen', 'before', 'film', 'doesn', '8217', 'exactly', 'succeed', 'doing', 'so', 'offer', 'few', 'impressive', 'set', 'pieces', 'compensation', '8220', 'What', 'Beneath', '8221', 'borrows', 'heavily', 'movies', '8220', 'Rebecca', '8221', '8220', 'Psycho', '8221', 'adding', 'generous', 'helpings', '8220', 'Rear', 'Window', '8221', '8220', 'Wait', 'Dark', '8221', 'mix', 'good', 'measure', 'effective', 'job', 'beginning', 'when', 'setting', 'up', 'scenario', 'injecting', 'just', 'enough', 'ambiguity', 'proceedings', 'make', 'question', 'Claire', 'truly', 'seeing', 'what', 'seeing', 'suffering', 'delusions', 'brought', 'mental', 'instability', 'Unfortunately', 'once', 'issue', 'decided', 'film', 'intriguing', 'quality', 'more', 'standard', 'issue', 'horror', 'film', 'Moreover', 'major', 'plot', '8220', 'twist', '8221', 'one', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'predict', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'Given', 'weaknesses', '8220', 'What', 'Beneath', '8221', 'goods', 'who', 'want', 'nothing', 'more', 'relaxing', 'goosepimply', 'good', 'time', 'movies', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'be', 'slumming', 'here', 'bit', 'how', 'shoot', 'effective', 'jump-out-of-your-seat', 'suspense', 'sequence', '8211', 'tend', 'rely', 'overmuch', '8220', 'false', 'scare', '8221', 'technique', 'be', 'so', 'popular', 'films', 'type', 'acting', 'Ford', 'pretty', 'much', 'walks', 'part', 'surely', 'dreaming', 'better', 'things', 'come', 'role', 'department', 'Pfeiffer', 'bring', 'dignity', 'depth', 'character', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'degenerated', 'hysterical', 'wife', 'stereotype', '8220', 'What', 'Beneath', '8221', 'effective', 'time', 'killer', 'provided', 'realize', 'beforehand', 'answer', 'film', '8217', 's', 'title', '8220', 'Not', 'much.', '8221']",What Lies Beneath VHS

526313,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00003CXI6,S. Schell,"[1, 1]","Shot at a time when Tom Hanks was busy losing about 50 lbs. for his epic ""Survivor"" rip-off ""Castaway"", Robert Zemeckis decided to shoot a little ghost story called ""What Lies Beneath"", a paranormal yarn about a woman who discovers there is more to history than just pictures in a frame.  WLB echoes of previous ghost stories such as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Stir of Echoes"", but like ""The Blair Witch Project"" relies more on what the imagination can conjure rather than flat-out showing you any frightening phantoms.  For what could be more terrifying than what we as an audience are capable of conjuring in the darkest recesses of our minds?Michelle Pfeiffer stars as Claire Spencer, a woman who along with her husband (Ford) is dealing with being an empty nester (her daughter has just left home for college).  With the house all to themselves, Claire is left with a lot of time on her hands to play with the family dog, reminisce on her cello and uncover a long-kept mystery.  The intrigue begins with a misleading scheme involving her next-door neighbor and her allegedly abusive husband.  This is a clever distraction to what really is going on behind closed doors, but of course I won't spoil it for anyone.  Soon after this, Claire begins experiencing random icy drafts floating around the house and doors opening by themselves before she has a chance to touch the knobs.  With a picture frame that is repeatedly knocked off the shelf and a stereo that spontaneously screams static, Claire becomes convinced that an otherworldly presence is trying desperately to communicate with her.  Terrified of its presence but suddenly made curious by an unearthed clue, she strives to become an essential medium and delves into the world of necromancy and the supernatural.Many of the visual effects done in WLB are truly incredible and are carried out with such subtlety that they are almost subliminal.  A remarkably eerie moment in the film is when Claire is fishing a ball out of the lake behind her house and suddenly spots a pallid and wraithlike silhouette of a woman under the waves.  The effect is done with such delicacy that even the audience is squinting long after the apparition has disappeared.Pfeiffer is extremely absorbed in her role, so engrossed in fact that one would suspect she herself is a firm believer in the supernatural. In that respect, she is highly entertaining and believable as Claire.  Harrison Ford, on the other hand, could use a little pep (at least until the climax of the movie, you'll enjoy him then).  Of course, the low-key nature of his character is done for specific reasons and it works out well in the end.  Diana Scarwid makes good use of her minute role as Claire's friend Jody.  James Remar is hardly recognizable as Warren Feur, the shady next-door neighbor and supermodel Amber Valetta makes startling appearances as the restless spirit that haunts Claire's home.Even thought ""What Lies Beneath"" borrows theme from other well-known paranormal thrillers, it sets itself apart from the rest with a ""spirited"" cast and clever visual effects.

Holding it next to so many other &quot;scary movies&quot; I have seen lately, WLB just seems stronger.The cinematography is simply amazing, and it's great to watch the two actors spar in great continuous extended shots with little or no editing.In a sense, it is a throwback to the days of Hitchcock, when &quot;classic&quot; actors were paired on the silver screen -- and that is part of the beauty of watching this flick.It's nice to see some character development in a thriller-- something lacking in current &quot;scary flicks&quot; -- a technique of which Hitchcock was a master.Pfeiffer nails the role, and Zemeckis knows how to play with that vulnerable edginess that she is known for. It's fun to watch her development from the facade of &quot;happy housewife&quot; to psychological wreck, then shift again to resolution out of necessity.All of the atmosphere is great &amp; Zemeckis goes the whole nine yards. So many shots in the pic are so well composed and executed.I think it's a great film to study if you are looking at elements of a horror movie.I highly reccomend waching the director's commentary, as it gives a better appreciation for the film as a whole.No, it's not quite &quot;The Shining,&quot; but it's still pretty damn good.",5,Underrated,1066953600,"10 24, 2003",2003,1520,"['Halloween', 'season', 'thought', 'would', 'get', 'WLB', 'again.This', 'film', 'strong', 'well', 'made', 'thriller', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'rarity', 'day', 'amp', 'find', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'flick', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Holding', 'next', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'quot', 'scary', 'movies', 'quot', 'have', 'seen', 'lately', 'WLB', 'just', 'stronger.The', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'amazing', 'great', 'watch', 'two', 'actors', 'spar', 'great', 'continuous', 'extended', 'shots', 'little', 'editing.In', 'sense', 'throwback', 'days', 'Hitchcock', 'when', 'quot', 'classic', 'quot', 'actors', 'were', 'paired', 'silver', 'screen', 'part', 'beauty', 'watching', 'flick.It', 'nice', 'see', 'character', 'development', 'thriller', 'something', 'lacking', 'current', 'quot', 'scary', 'flicks', 'quot', 'technique', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'master.Pfeiffer', 'role', 'Zemeckis', 'how', 'play', 'vulnerable', 'edginess', 'known', 'fun', 'watch', 'development', 'facade', 'quot', 'happy', 'housewife', 'quot', 'psychological', 'wreck', 'then', 'shift', 'again', 'resolution', 'necessity.All', 'atmosphere', 'great', 'amp', 'Zemeckis', 'whole', 'nine', 'yards', 'So', 'many', 'shots', 'pic', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'composed', 'executed.I', 'think', 'great', 'film', 'study', 'are', 'looking', 'elements', 'horror', 'movie.I', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'waching', 'director', 'commentary', 'better', 'appreciation', 'film', 'whole.No', 'not', 'quite', 'quot', 'Shining', 'quot', 'still', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good']",What Lies Beneath VHS
526316,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00003CXI6,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[4, 4]","Amazon's review really nails this film for the intelligent, old-fashioned edge-of-your-seat thriller that it is, but it is a flawed film too.No need to rehash the plot as both Amazon's review and the product description tell you enough about the film, so I'll get right to what I loved, liked, and disliked about this film, but let me warn you in advance that this review contains serious SPOILERS that I feel I can't ignore while writing this review as it specifically connects to the flaws the film contains.This film's strengths:  Don't let the box title fool you with Harrison Ford's name being first, which is based upon his considerable star power, this film belongs to Michelle Pfieffer and to her alone although a very young Miranda Otto fromThe Lord of the Rings Trilogy,Flight of the Phoenix, andWar of the Worldsgives a noteworthy supporting performance.  Ford himself really plays second fiddle to Pfieffer in this thriller and although he gives a good performance, he seems out of place being a supporting actor and looks rather uncomfortable during most of this film.The script is intelligently written and slowly reveals the plot in such a way that we feel we know what is coming, but we are as unsure as Pfieffer's character as to the ""truth"" of things.  The direction is first-rate by Robert (Back to the Futureand Forrest Gump) Zemeckis as he experiments with playing Alfred (The BirdsandPsycho) Hitchcock.  He builds this little masterpiece up to a compelling and chilling conclusion that doesn't disappoint even though it does leave us scratching our heads a bit.The film's weaknesses: Simply put . . . it's Harrison Ford's presence in this film which ends up being rather distracting.  At the time he was too big of a star to play such a supporting role and one keeps scratching his head wondering just why he's in this film.  In addition, Ford himself seems so uncomfortable not being the main attraction.  I don't mean that he's too egotistical to play a supporting role, but he had been a number one box-office draw for nearly two decades at this point that I just don't feel he knew how to fade into the background in a less starring role.  Lastly, while he makes a (spoiler alert here) remorseful guilt-ridden bad guy, he does not make a believable self-serving psychopath and the faulty script at the end attempts to make him BOTH.That is the film's other serious weakness.  Ford's character is supposed to be guilt-ridden over an affair he had with a college student that ended with him murdering her.  Ford is actually very good at playing flawed characters as many of his heroes are such, but the script also has him as a lunatic at the end.  First he's genuinely sorry for his affair, his part in the death of his lover, and the pain this has caused his wife to experience, and we, the audience buy that as Ford is great at playing stronge but emotional characters as with his great performances inThe FugitiveandAir Force One, but the script then has him enjoying his attempt at murdering his wife (Pfieffer).  He jokingly asks her if she would rather have hot or cold water in the tub as he attempts to drown her and then even loving plays with his dog as she is drowning before his eyes.  Is this the same man who was crying, literally, to his wife over what had happened with that other woman.  In an otherwise intelligently written and well-acted film, this is a glaring inconsistancy in a character and it doesn't add up.  Add that to an already uncomfortable performance by Ford in a supporting role and you get an ending that is somewhat murky if not still thrilling and suspenseful.Well, I don't want to end this review on a negative note as this film deserves all four stars that I gave it, but it's not without its flaws.  This slickly, well-executed thriller is worth both your time and money, but just don't be surprised if you find yourself scratching your head a bit when it's all done.",4,A performance driven Hitchcockian thriller.,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,3932,"['Amazon', 'review', 'really', 'film', 'intelligent', 'old-fashioned', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'thriller', 'flawed', 'film', 'too.No', 'need', 'rehash', 'plot', 'Amazon', 'review', 'product', 'description', 'enough', 'film', ""'ll"", 'get', 'right', 'what', 'loved', 'liked', 'disliked', 'film', 'let', 'warn', 'advance', 'review', 'serious', 'SPOILERS', 'feel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'writing', 'review', 'specifically', 'flaws', 'film', 'contains.This', 'film', 'strengths', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'box', 'title', 'fool', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'name', 'being', 'first', 'based', 'considerable', 'star', 'power', 'film', 'Michelle', 'Pfieffer', 'alone', 'very', 'young', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'fromThe', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Trilogy', 'Flight', 'Phoenix', 'andWar', 'Worldsgives', 'noteworthy', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Ford', 'really', 'second', 'fiddle', 'Pfieffer', 'thriller', 'good', 'performance', 'place', 'being', 'supporting', 'actor', 'rather', 'uncomfortable', 'most', 'film.The', 'script', 'intelligently', 'written', 'slowly', 'plot', 'such', 'way', 'feel', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'are', 'as', 'unsure', 'Pfieffer', 'character', 'truth', 'things', 'direction', 'first-rate', 'Robert', 'Back', 'Futureand', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Zemeckis', 'playing', 'Alfred', 'BirdsandPsycho', 'Hitchcock', 'little', 'masterpiece', 'up', 'compelling', 'chilling', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'even', 'leave', 'scratching', 'heads', 'bit.The', 'film', 'weaknesses', 'Simply', 'put', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'presence', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'rather', 'distracting', 'time', 'was', 'too', 'big', 'star', 'play', 'supporting', 'role', 'one', 'keeps', 'scratching', 'head', 'wondering', 'just', 'why', 'film', 'addition', 'Ford', 'so', 'uncomfortable', 'not', 'being', 'main', 'attraction', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'too', 'egotistical', 'play', 'supporting', 'role', 'had', 'been', 'number', 'one', 'box-office', 'draw', 'nearly', 'two', 'decades', 'point', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'knew', 'how', 'fade', 'background', 'less', 'starring', 'role', 'Lastly', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'here', 'remorseful', 'guilt-ridden', 'bad', 'guy', 'not', 'make', 'believable', 'self-serving', 'psychopath', 'faulty', 'script', 'end', 'make', 'BOTH.That', 'film', 'other', 'serious', 'weakness', 'Ford', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'guilt-ridden', 'affair', 'had', 'college', 'student', 'ended', 'murdering', 'Ford', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'playing', 'flawed', 'characters', 'many', 'heroes', 'are', 'such', 'script', 'also', 'lunatic', 'end', 'First', 'genuinely', 'sorry', 'affair', 'part', 'death', 'lover', 'pain', 'caused', 'wife', 'experience', 'audience', 'buy', 'Ford', 'great', 'playing', 'stronge', 'emotional', 'characters', 'great', 'performances', 'inThe', 'FugitiveandAir', 'Force', 'One', 'script', 'then', 'enjoying', 'attempt', 'murdering', 'wife', 'Pfieffer', 'jokingly', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'hot', 'cold', 'water', 'tub', 'drown', 'then', 'even', 'loving', 'plays', 'dog', 'drowning', 'eyes', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'crying', 'literally', 'wife', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'other', 'woman', 'otherwise', 'intelligently', 'written', 'well-acted', 'film', 'glaring', 'inconsistancy', 'character', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'Add', 'already', 'uncomfortable', 'performance', 'Ford', 'supporting', 'role', 'get', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'murky', 'not', 'still', 'thrilling', 'suspenseful.Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'review', 'negative', 'note', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'gave', 'not', 'flaws', 'slickly', 'well-executed', 'thriller', 'worth', 'time', 'money', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'scratching', 'head', 'bit', 'when', 'done']",What Lies Beneath VHS

It should have been rated R instead.I this movie, Harrison Ford, is the Dr. Norman Spencer who is a genetic researcher. He is always working at home on the computer. He has a lot of experience at the local college. His wife is played by Pheiffer, her name is Claire. Claire is a former musician.Claire has strange visions and weird things start happening to her.Claire started to meet the new neighbors who always seem to be having martial problems. They stand out side and scream at one another till one of them gets angry and heads inside. Then the next minute they are very intimate. Claire begins to suspect her husband of hurting her. She begins to watch out of her bedroom windows with binoculars. She thinks that he has hurt Mary. Mary disappears for awhile and Claire presumes her as dead.The strange things that are happening to Claire she just thinks that they are Mary trying to contact her. Claire felt horrible for not helping her out and now she is paying her back. The strange things that were happening were the front door would open before Claire even touched it, a picture of Doc Spencer and some of his colleagues would fall over and shatter the glass, the bath tub would fill up with water, strange sayings would appear on the mirror and computer screen that said MEF.After all the strange things occurring Claire became very determined on finding out what was behind all these ghostly appearances. She begin to see a girl with green eyes and blond hair in several places throughout the house and water reflections. She didn't know this woman but thought it was Mary. She hadn't really ever seem Mary except through the fence the day she was having trouble.The saga continues with the Ghost throughout the whole movie. During the rest of the movie you will find out who this &quot;ghost&quot; actually is. Ford plays a really strange character in this movie. You will be amazed at the ending.I thought the movie was wonderful and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. You never really know what is going to happen.

The film is set in the aftermath of her sending her daughter Caitlin (Norman's stepdaughter) to college and away from the secluded lakeside family home in Vermont. Claire, oddly enough, begins to &quot;hear voices&quot; and experience hallucinations in the vicinity of the lakeside domicile, which include seeing the face of a young woman reflected in the lake. Growing increasingly distraught, Claire begins to consult a psychiatrist, as well as a medium with the help of a ouija board, while entertaining the suspicion that the couple who live next door are involved, especially so since the wife has disappeared, without any plausible explanation, some time before. Slowly, and with much trepidation, Claire is convinced that the only way she can come to the bottom of the problem is to &quot;make contact&quot; with the phenomenon inhabiting the house and the outlying surroundings. This thriller unfolds breathlessly, generating a number of twists (but few surprises) along the way, as we discover the reality of Claire's and Norman's marriage, their strained emotional life and a dark spot in their past. The film excells as a suspense-charged tale, laced with elements of the paranormal and supernatural, eventually building up to a tense climax involving a flooding bathtub and a furious car chase, both which provide helmsman David Zemeckis with the opportunity of scoring some genuine shocks. The performances of the two mature star leads are deserving of the highest praise, with Ford in his typical aggressive, but also sensitive mode, while Pfeiffer, who is now well into her forties, remains astonishing.",4,Hitchcockian horror mystery,998611200,"08 24, 2001",2001,1836,"['Harrison', 'Ford', 'Norman', 'workaholic', 'academic', 'research', 'geneticist', 'who', 'have', 'worries', 'wife', 'Claire', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'retired', 'cellist', 'who', 'suffered', 'time', 'ago', 'serious', 'car', 'crash', 'film', 'set', 'aftermath', 'sending', 'daughter', 'Caitlin', 'Norman', 'stepdaughter', 'college', 'away', 'secluded', 'lakeside', 'family', 'home', 'Vermont', 'Claire', 'oddly', 'enough', 'quot', 'hear', 'voices', 'quot', 'experience', 'hallucinations', 'vicinity', 'lakeside', 'domicile', 'include', 'seeing', 'face', 'young', 'woman', 'reflected', 'lake', 'Growing', 'increasingly', 'distraught', 'Claire', 'consult', 'psychiatrist', 'as', 'well', 'medium', 'help', 'ouija', 'board', 'entertaining', 'suspicion', 'couple', 'who', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'are', 'involved', 'especially', 'so', 'wife', 'disappeared', 'plausible', 'explanation', 'time', 'Slowly', 'much', 'trepidation', 'Claire', 'convinced', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'come', 'bottom', 'problem', 'quot', 'make', 'contact', 'quot', 'phenomenon', 'inhabiting', 'house', 'outlying', 'surroundings', 'thriller', 'breathlessly', 'generating', 'number', 'twists', 'few', 'surprises', 'way', 'discover', 'reality', 'Claire', 'Norman', 'marriage', 'strained', 'emotional', 'life', 'dark', 'spot', 'past', 'film', 'suspense-charged', 'tale', 'laced', 'elements', 'paranormal', 'supernatural', 'eventually', 'building', 'up', 'tense', 'climax', 'involving', 'flooding', 'bathtub', 'furious', 'car', 'chase', 'provide', 'helmsman', 'David', 'Zemeckis', 'opportunity', 'scoring', 'genuine', 'shocks', 'performances', 'two', 'mature', 'star', 'leads', 'are', 'deserving', 'highest', 'praise', 'Ford', 'typical', 'aggressive', 'also', 'sensitive', 'mode', 'Pfeiffer', 'who', 'now', 'well', 'forties', 'astonishing']",What Lies Beneath VHS

Claire (Pfeiffer) and Norman (Ford) are a well-to-do married couple living on a somewhat palacial lakeside estate in Vermont. Norman's a research scientist and spends much of his time finishing papers and giving lectures while Claire stays at home, dealing with the emotional aftereffects of a recent car crash.  Norman has a stepdaughter, Caitlin, who goes off to college at the beginning of the movie. For the first time in years, Claire is alone in the house, and she notices strange things afoot. She experiences some strange phenomena, including a woman's reflection in her bathwater. The fragile Claire is convinced the disturbances have something to do with the strange couple next door, and urges her husband to look into the matter. He finds nothing, of course, and asks her to see a therapist, thinking that his lovely wife is still unstable, but the therapist recommends contacting whatever might be causing the disturbances, and that's when the fun begins.It's ironic that a movie be entitled ""What Lies Beneath"" when it is so shallow. This picture is typical Hitchcock suspense with plenty of creaks and jumps and `look behind you' scenes, but there aren't enough full on scare sequences and much of these are just overused clich&eacute;s. Director Robert Zemeckis (""Back to the Future"", ""Forrest Gump"") is clearly having a blast behind the camera and successfully masters yet another genre. He puts a tremendous deal of skill into the proceedings; however, there simply isn't enough material to work with. The film uneasily balances between domestic drama, supernatural chiller and all-out thriller, and the three sub-genres simply don't gel.  As the neurotic housewife, Michelle Pfeiffer is perfectly cast and brings depth to her first good role in a long time and holds her own against the more popular Harrison Ford, who curiously avoids the limelight for most of the movie.  As soon as the emotional hokum gets going, the film loses a good deal of momentum, but the shear suspense of it all is what keeps `What Lies Beneath' going. But with the uneasy mixture, the bogeyman material seems out of place when in tone with the thriller aspect.

526324,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B00003CXI6,Thomas M. Sipos,"[6, 11]","If you're looking for a quiet but scary, wintry ghost story -- pass this one by.You're better off renting The Changeling (Canadian 1979), a film of quiet ghostly scares.  Atmospheric, suspenseful, thought-provoking.  Or try Ghost Story (1981), a film with beautiful wintry scenes, and rich characters played by seasoned Hollywood Golden Age pros.  The Changeling is a low-budget import, Ghost Story a big studio effort, yet both are excellent ghost films.As for What Lies Beneath ... well, it's hardly worth sitting through two hours to find out.Despite its length, its star cast and star director, What Lies Beneath has a smallish story.  One trade critic compared it to a TV movie.  True enough.  What Lies Beneath feels as though it was written as a TV movie, until by some miracle Harrison Ford, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Robert Zemeckis were conned into it.  Maybe one of them actually liked it, signed on, and then it snowballed.  Once those names signed on, distribution had to shift to the big screen.  The script was lengthened to accommodate the theatrical distribution and star talent (important people require a film of important length).  A few unnecessary special effects further padded the story.It's still a small story.  And not a terribly original or compelling one.Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer are a trendy but classy New England couple.  He's a college professor, she's a former concert cellist who gave up her career to raise a daughter.  They're the sort of people who've lived or worked in Manhattan, attend museums, summer at the Hamptons or Martha's Vineyard, and try to find authenticity in a faux rustic lifestyle.  Literate, sophisticated, a perfect New York Times Sunday Magazine kind of lifestyle in a small northeastern college town.But things only appear perfect.  Soon after their daughter is sent off to college, Michelle Pfeiffer imagines things.  She thinks the couple next door may not be what they seem.  She imagines murder.  She imagines ghosts.  But her initial suspicions prove wrong.  So too her new suspicions.  What Lies Beneath is full of twists and turns, and red herrings leading into more twists and turns, and still more red herrings and twists and turns.Long before film's end, one wearies.All the twists and turns and discoveries feel less suspenseful than artificial.  It's as if Zemeckis thought: ""Gee, there are so many ways this film can go ... so many good possibilities ... let's use them all!""Yet despite its ponderous length and pretty cinematography, What Lies Beneath remains a Lifetime Original TV movie.  Men are evil, concealing a ""beast within.""  Women are victims -- smart and brave! -- but weakened by their one great fault: they just ""love too much.""  (Another critic noted that whenever a man commits adultery in a Lifetime movie, it's inexcusable.  When a women commits adultery, it's ""a matter of the heart.""  In that sense, The Bridges of Madison County and was also a TV movie).It's hard to discuss this film without giving away its red herrings or surprise twists, or letting on which is which.  Suffice to say that issues of spousal abuse and adultery and murder all emerge at various points.  The title has two meanings: what lies beneath the veneer of domestic tranquility that neighbors present to the world, and the veneer of love and fidelity that couples present to each other.  And what lies beneath the ground, and beneath the lake.I don't know who'd like this film.  It's more of a ""chick flick"" than a horror film.  But ""chick flick"" fans (which does not include all women) would dislike the occasional ghostly gore.  Horror fans would respond: ""What gore?""  For that matter: ""What scares?""There are a few shocks buried in those wearying hours.  The ghostly makeup evokes Ghost Story.  (Now there's a ""wronged woman"" film that horror fans can enjoy!  If you're tempted to see What Lies Beneath, see Ghost Story instead).What else?Harrison Ford plays against type.  Pfeiffer's the heroine, Ford the cad.  That's good for one big surprise (except now I've ruined it for you -- sorry).  What Lies Beneath seems intended as a star vehicle for Pfeiffer.  But since when do TV movies qualify as ""star vehicles?""  When they're released the big screen?Pfeiffer has a clich&eacute;d Best Friend.  The usual ""Rhoda type.""  Slightly overweight (obese, by Hollywood standards), always arriving unannounced, full of wisecracks.  One almost hears a TV sitcom laugh trax whenever her unwelcome presence intrudes, adding yet another unnecessary layer to this sluggish mess.There is also a clich&eacute;d Musty Occult Book.  You know the type.  Whenever someone in a horror film or TV show confronts the supernatural, they always visit a dim library or used bookstore to research the topic.  There they discover a thick, heavy, rare, dusty, musty volume of ancient lore.  Seems these books are hard to come by.  No wonder these people know nothing about ghosts, or vampires, or werewolves.  For some reason, they never enter a brightly lit Barnes & Noble superstore, where they'd find many aisles of occult books in the New Age section.  And not the old musty kind with woodcut illustrations, but shiny, new, clean-smelling paperbacks.Appropriately, it is the clich&eacute;d Wisecracking Best Friend who delivers the clich&eacute;d Musty Occult Book to Pfeiffer.As for the special effects, they're pretty, but often unnecessary.  Without the effects, What Lies Beneath could have been shot as a workable TV movie.  One senses that after the stars signed on and theatrical distribution was secured, the budget rose in all areas, so they had to find ways to spend it.For instance, the final scene is in a cemetery.  It's the prettiest scene in the film, seemingly shot indoors on a sound stage.  Wintry gray ""skies.""  Shades of gray tinged with white and black, creating a bleak, expressionistic -- almost Caligarian -- sensibility.  Then as a final touch, just before the end credits, the outlines of a woman's face forms in the snow.  Not a clear image, but the kind one sees in passing clouds.I expect a team of computer graphic artists spent at least several days on just that one image.  It's a pretty image, but wholly unnecessary to the film.It's still just a TV movie.",1,"Smallish, dull, clich&eacute;d story, full of TV stereotypes",1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,6247,"[""'re"",

However it manages to work wonders if you want your pants scared off.Director Robert Zemeckis claims this as his homage to Hitchcock, and as such it works far better than 1998's &quot;Psycho&quot; remake.  He deftly employs The Master's favorite themes of voyerism and illusion, and much of Claire's psychological issues seem to have come straight from his mind.  Then there's that wonderful bathtub scene...Of course, the movie also uses some cheap scare tactics, but right up until the final bath, this film seems to have a decent hold on itself.  After that, though, we are treated to almost every &quot;horror&quot; cliche in the book.  This is still better done than most films in that category today, with Zemeckis using his now trademark mirror-effects and nifty camerawork, but the final underwater climax is just plain silly.I will say that, because of its style and the fact that it prefers suspense to gore and violence, it *is* still better than the standard horror fare.

Well, towards the end of the movie, one comes to know that Pfeiffer's hubby - dear had murdered a young woman, sometime in the `forgotten' past, and got rid of the cadaver by driving it off into some lake of some sort. In the aftermath, the unappeased soul made those strange appearances in those `hydrated' places, to seek revenge. What a smart piece of direction! I think not; no way. Now, one question pops up in mind that, if the `dissatisfied' soul is unhappy over its death - process, why bother Pfeiffer? Wouldn't it make life less complicated, if she scared Harrison Ford, if it is he, who she wants to settle a score with? I am confused. The story is baseless. In fact, there is no storyline at all. There are a lot of unexplained things, forced on the viewer, which are dumb, in effect, treating the viewer as someone, who can take any sort of ..., and be contented with the faade created by the horrifyingly thrilling special effects, to cover for the feeble story - line. On a different note, Michelle Pfeiffer puts up a brilliant performance. She is really good. Harrison Ford doesn't have much of a scope for acting; so he can be rendered as redundant. The thrill - creating scenes are very well done, and the movie is quite scary in a lot of places.At the end of the day, it is some `cool' `hair - raising' direction, that saves this otherwise sorry effort.",3,"FRIGHTENING, BUT DUMB",1039305600,"12 8, 2002",2002,1867,"['movie', 'really', 'nothing', 'much', 'save', 'barrage', 'denunciations', 'coming', 'way', 'fact', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'very', 'well', 'directed', 'rather', 'runtime', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'seeing', 'sudden', 'images', 'dead', 'girl', 'sorts', 'places', 'especially', 'store', 'water', 'know', 'pond', 'bath', 'tub', 'etc', 'What', 'more', 'interesting', 'reason', 'appearances', 'defaced', 'face', 'only', 'certain', 'hydrated', 'places', 'Well', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'know', 'Pfeiffer', 'hubby', 'dear', 'had', 'murdered', 'young', 'woman', 'sometime', 'forgotten', 'past', 'got', 'rid', 'cadaver', 'driving', 'off', 'lake', 'sort', 'aftermath', 'unappeased', 'soul', 'made', 'strange', 'appearances', 'hydrated', 'places', 'seek', 'revenge', 'What', 'smart', 'piece', 'direction', 'think', 'not', 'way', 'Now', 'one', 'question', 'up', 'mind', 'dissatisfied', 'soul', 'unhappy', 'death', 'process', 'why', 'bother', 'Pfeiffer', 'Would', ""n't"", 'make', 'life', 'less', 'complicated', 'scared', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'who', 'settle', 'score', 'am', 'confused', 'story', 'baseless', 'fact', 'storyline', 'are', 'lot', 'unexplained', 'things', 'forced', 'viewer', 'are', 'dumb', 'effect', 'treating', 'viewer', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'sort', 'be', 'contented', 'faade', 'created', 'horrifyingly', 'thrilling', 'special', 'effects', 'cover', 'feeble', 'story', 'line', 'different', 'note', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'up', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'really', 'good', 'Harrison', 'Ford', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'scope', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'rendered', 'redundant', 'thrill', 'creating', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'quite', 'scary', 'lot', 'places.At', 'end', 'day', 'cool', 'hair', 'raising', 'direction', 'otherwise', 'sorry', 'effort']",What Lies Beneath VHS

Now in an &#34;empty nest&#34;, Claire begins to hear voices, sense a presence, and witnesses many strange things happening around the house and with the neighbors.  Is she going a bit loopy...or is something really going on?I am a huge fan of mysteries, and this film is most definitely full of that!  Robert Zemeckis is a master director, so he knows exactly how to craft a movie with the right kind of pacing to fully suck the viewer into the lives of Claire and Norman.  Not until the final few minutes of the movie do you know exactly what is going on.  I would like to say more, but to do so would go into spoiler territory, and this is one of those movies where you don't want to be spoiled!&#34;What Lies Beneath&#34; is (admittedly, by the producers) a throwback to Hitchcock's &#34;Psycho&#34;.
