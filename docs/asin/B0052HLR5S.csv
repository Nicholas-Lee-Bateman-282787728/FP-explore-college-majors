There was so much more to explore with her character. For instance, what does happen when her ""assets"" devalue? Does she settle down to a ""suburban hell"", (in her opinion), become a Madame like Stephanie, or does she get a REAL job?Leaving these characters so lost and dangling was a bad call on the part of Showtime, and dropping this clever, cheeky dramedy for shows like ""Californication"", ""Shameless"" and ""House of Lies"".

1437885,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0052HLR5S,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[49, 53]","Before I comment on Showtime's ""Secret Diary of a Call Girl"" which just wrapped up its concluding season, I must ponder the curious announcement of the Final Season (Season Four) DVD release.  Lions Gate owned the rights for the first two seasons and Paramount is releasing this season, but it begs the question--just who owns the rights to Season Three and what's going on?  At first, I assumed this might be a compilation of the last two seasons--but with a listing of one disc at 187 minutes, this does not seem to be the case.  I researched outside of Amazon in the event their listing was erroneous, but I have encountered the same information at alternate sources.  So where is Season Three?  And without it, is there really much of a market for this product at this time?  I will just say that pivotal relationships evolved in Season Three as did Belle's career and to skip the entire story sequence is doing a great disservice to this spry and entertaining show.  But, be that as it may, I will serve up some specific comments relating to the Final Season.Season Four begins with the on again/off again relationship of best friends Hannah/Belle (Billie Piper) and Ben (Iddo Goldberg) in newfound stability.  But the couple is destined for continued stresses and strains.  As much as Ben seems to want to be relaxed in the coupling--Belle's unorthodox obligations perpetually drive a wedge between them.  One of the season's largest plot lines revolves around Belle's boss (the criminally underutilized Cherie Lunghi) going to jail and her naive daughter living with Belle.  Belle must now juggle Lunghi's job as appointment setter (I'm using a polite euphemism) as well as the secrets she has kept from her child.  This becomes increasingly problematic as the girl starts to behave in decidedly more confrontational ways.  Belle also ventures to New York, battles with Charlotte (the season's MVP Gemma Chan finally getting a chance to shine), experiences an unexpected tragedy, and engages in a dangerous new dalliance with a detective.Through the eight episodes, we're constantly left with the question of whether Belle can really have it all.  Is this destined for a happy ending?  Or will the same problems and frustrations continue to circle?  The detective (Paul Nicholls) seems to be able to cope with the complexities of Belle's existence despite being slightly creepy.  But Ben has always been the course of true love.  The program sets the choice up for Belle between the two men--but it's not as simple as it seems.  The real quandary is what is right and true for Belle discounting everything else.  Piper is given nice material and moments of genuine drama as she wrestles with her choices.  And, in the end, ""Secret Diary of a Call Girl"" eschews conventional expectations with an ending that seems perfectly in tune with this amusing, but hard edged, comedy.  A solid season most noteworthy for Piper's emotional transformation and Chan's comic mischief.  But again, what does it all mean without Season Three to set it up?

1437889,A2LFWRKGPW5PU0,B0052HLR5S,"Ramm ""DVD-OCD""","[8, 9]","Wish I could say the the 'Final Season' (4) of Showtime's ""Secret Diary of A Call Girl"" ended with a 'bang' but (for me) it was more of a 'thud'. I really got into the whole mythos of 'Belle de Jour' - read all of her books (based on the infamous blog that launched the series) and really enjoyed the way that the TV series initially portrayed the characters and sexy situations that (the real) Belle described in her autobiography. Billie Piper was gorgeous & fresh as the liberated call-girl with a heart of gold, the tension between characters was nicely balanced, the dialog saucy, and even the 'tricks' were interesting & believable - with just enuf skin to remind you that this was an 'adult' cable show. Things moved very smoothly thru the first 3 seasons. For those that are perplexed at the lack of availability in North America of the third season ( I agree - what the heck!?!) the 3rd Season IS out there but only in a Region 2 PAL version (available from Amazon.UK) - yet another good reason to get a 'region free' DVD player!The 4th Season manages to chip away much that the show had working for it. Not to say that there aren't a few choice moments to be enjoyed during the 8 final episodes - but the series seems to have run out of gas (and ideas).  The edgey chemistry between Belle and her 'best mate' wanna-be boyfriend, Ben, devolves into a lot of unattractive squabbling when they try to attempt a live-in relationship and a somewhat annoying new character, Poppy (daughter of Belle's temporarily incarcerated 'madame', Stephanie) is introduced to further muck things up. A new, rather un-likable, male 'detective' character is also injected as a counter-foil to Ben adding yet more aggravation to the mix.  Generally,  everything seems taken a bit too much to the extreme - Belle's 'clients' fetishes become comically absurd (less 'human' & sexy) and the make-up and hair styles manage to make even the lovely Ms Piper look like a trashy streetwalker much of the time. Possibly some of this is 'intentional' as much of the drama of the series is based  on the duality of Belle's character struggling between wanting to be 'normal' but also loving the excitement and wealth that her escort business ensures.  Thus, despite the efforts to glamorize the 'pay for play' lifestyle - the old morality creeps in and the tawdry aspects of a 'life of sin' are emphasized via the make-up... one would have to imagine that the show's producers must own 'stock' in a mascara francise!  I noted there were a couple of 'new' directors for the final season and maybe it was their 'vision' that sorta changed the tenor of the show to one of shrillness approaching outright parody - where even the beautiful & sophisticated Belle is made to appear grotesque in numerous scenes. By the time the plot concludes in a tumultuous flurry of tortured indecision and a rather haggard looking Belle stalks resolutely off into the darkness with great rivers of black eyeliner streaming down her face - I was feelin': 'Yeah, enough already - time to wrap this one up!'.  Doubtless, die hard fans of the series will wish to see how it all culminates - but be prepared to be under-whelmed. I sincerely hope that the 'real' Belle/Hannah is having a happier time in her life than what was crafted for her celluloid counterpart's denouemont.",3,Belle's Finale Fizzles,1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,3329,"['Wish', 'could', 'say', ""'Final"", 'Season', '4', 'Showtime', 'Secret', 'Diary', 'A', 'Call', 'Girl', 'ended', ""'bang"", 'was', 'more', ""'thud"", 'really', 'got', 'whole', 'mythos', ""'Belle"", 'de', 'Jour', 'read', 'books', 'based', 'infamous', 'blog', 'launched', 'series', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'TV', 'series', 'initially', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'sexy', 'situations', 'real', 'Belle', 'described', 'autobiography', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'fresh', 'liberated', 'call-girl', 'heart', 'gold', 'tension', 'characters', 'was', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'dialog', 'saucy', 'even', ""'tricks"", 'were', 'interesting', 'believable', 'just', 'enuf', 'skin', 'remind', 'was', ""'adult"", 'cable', 'show', 'Things', 'moved', 'very', 'smoothly', 'thru', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'are', 'perplexed', 'lack', 'availability', 'North', 'America', 'third', 'season', 'agree', 'what', 'heck', '3rd', 'Season', 'out', 'there', 'only', 'Region', '2', 'PAL', 'version', 'available', 'Amazon.UK', 'yet', 'good', 'reason', 'get', ""'region"", 'free', 'DVD', 'player', '4th', 'Season', 'manages', 'chip', 'away', 'much', 'show', 'had', 'working', 'Not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'few', 'choice', 'moments', 'be', 'enjoyed', '8', 'final', 'episodes', 'series', 'have', 'run', 'gas', 'ideas', 'edgey', 'chemistry', 'Belle', ""'best"", 'mate', 'wanna-be', 'boyfriend', 'Ben', 'lot', 'unattractive', 'squabbling', 'when', 'try', 'attempt', 'live-in', 'relationship', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'new', 'character', 'Poppy', 'daughter', 'Belle', 'temporarily', 'incarcerated', ""'madame"", 'Stephanie', 'introduced', 'further', 'muck', 'things', 'up', 'new', 'rather', 'un-likable', 'male', 'character', 'also', 'injected', 'counter-foil', 'Ben', 'adding', 'yet', 'more', 'aggravation', 'mix', 'Generally', 'everything', 'taken', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'extreme', 'Belle', ""'clients"", 'fetishes', 'become', 'comically', 'absurd', 'less', ""'human"", 'sexy', 'make-up', 'hair', 'styles', 'manage', 'make', 'even', 'lovely', 'Ms', 'Piper', 'look', 'trashy', 'streetwalker', 'much', 'time', 'Possibly', ""'intentional"", 'much', 'drama', 'series', 'based', 'duality', 'Belle', 'character', 'struggling', 'wanting', 'be', ""'normal"", 'also', 'loving', 'excitement', 'wealth', 'escort', 'business', 'ensures', 'Thus', 'efforts', 'glamorize', ""'pay"", 'play', 'lifestyle', 'old', 'morality', 'creeps', 'tawdry', 'aspects', ""'life"", 'sin', 'are', 'emphasized', 'make-up', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'imagine', 'show', 'producers', 'must', 'own', ""'stock"", 'mascara', 'francise', 'noted', 'were', 'couple', ""'new"", 'directors', 'final', 'season', 'maybe', 'was', ""'vision"", 'sorta', 'changed', 'tenor', 'show', 'one', 'shrillness', 'approaching', 'outright', 'parody', 'where', 'even', 'beautiful', 'sophisticated', 'Belle', 'made', 'appear', 'grotesque', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'time', 'plot', 'tumultuous', 'flurry', 'tortured', 'indecision', 'rather', 'haggard', 'looking', 'Belle', 'stalks', 'resolutely', 'darkness', 'great', 'rivers', 'black', 'eyeliner', 'streaming', 'down', 'face', 'was', 'feelin', ""'Yeah"", 'enough', 'already', 'time', 'wrap', 'one', 'up', 'Doubtless', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'series', 'will', 'wish', 'see', 'how', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'under-whelmed', 'sincerely', 'hope', ""'real"", 'Belle/Hannah', 'having', 'happier', 'time', 'life', 'what', 'was', 'crafted', 'celluloid', 'counterpart', 'denouemont']",Secret Diary of a Call Girl: The Final Season

I own one of Billie Piper's greatest hits music collections (which is pretty good) and I have seen her in a few Dr. Who performances (also strong performances).  Billie Piper gives an excellent portrayal as Hannah Baxter. Hannah Baxter happens to be an intelligent high class escort who is incredibly gifted in her job.  Baxter's character is shown to be living in a lavish house and having clients from very affluent backgrounds. Hannah Baxter even ends up working temporarily as a London madam for her boss Stephanie (played in a fantastic way by Cherie Lunghi).  Snippets from the song ""You Know I'm No Good"" by the late Amy Winehouse are used for the theme of ""Secret Diary Of A Call Girl"". It is made very obvious in season four that she makes a good living as a high class call girl and is even offered the chance to have her life story translated into a movie.  By the way, the episode where the movie idea gets pitched to Hannah Baxter is extremely humorous.  Hannah Baxter also deals with strong professional competition from Charlotte (played in a convincing way by Gemma Chan). In season 4, Hannah Baxter must also choose between Ben (well played by Iddo Goldberg) or her job.  I confess that I think that ""Secret Diary Of A Call Girl: Season 4"" would make an interesting film.  Obviously, it would also be a good idea to consult with the woman that the whole series is based on (to strengthen the plot and message of the movie).
