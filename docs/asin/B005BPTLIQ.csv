1452604,A32T2H8150OJLU,B005BPTLIQ,ARH,"[28, 32]","My 12-yr daughter and I moved right into Season 2 as soon as we finished Season 1.We noticed a few things right away.1) The screen width was cut down from widescreen to a traditional TV 3:4 ratio picture.2) The claymation animators made changes to the appearance of some of the characters. These include the Farmer who now has a perpetual 5 o-clock shadow, Blitzer the dog who now has hair-like details rather than the simpler more innocent smooth finish you would be used to seeing on Gromit (if you know Wallace and Gromit) and more detail around the mouth and nose.  The cat has been upgraded from a sort of wolverine/bear like critter to a cat with claws, and it plays a bigger role in season 2 than in season 1.  While a few of these changes were probably a good idea, I think that changes to the characters' appearances were more distracting than beneficial.  Like I mentioned before, these changes made the characters less innocent looking and, well, I missed most of the old versions.3) One of the things that totally cracked me up about Season 1 was the way that Blitzer blows his whistle and occasionally hands out yellow or red cards, just like a soccer (football) referee.  Sadly, he doesn't do that any more.  I REALLY miss that.Anyway, changes aside, the series is still worth a look, especially if you still have children around the house.  Oh, and I still love the pigs.  They and the sheet still mix things up from time to time - hilarious!The animation is still fun and fresh, and changes aside, it's still a solid 4-star offering (considering Wallace and Gromit in their three original adventures as being 5 stars).If you like Wallace and Gromit or Shaun the Sheep Season 1, you will almost certainly like Season 2 as well.Keep up the good work!",4,And the bleat goes on...,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,1764,"['12-yr', 'daughter', 'moved', 'right', 'Season', '2', 'as', 'soon', 'finished', 'Season', '1.We', 'noticed', 'few', 'things', 'right', 'away.1', 'screen', 'width', 'was', 'cut', 'down', 'widescreen', 'traditional', 'TV', '3:4', 'ratio', 'picture.2', 'claymation', 'animators', 'made', 'changes', 'appearance', 'characters', 'include', 'Farmer', 'who', 'now', 'perpetual', '5', 'o-clock', 'shadow', 'Blitzer', 'dog', 'who', 'now', 'hair-like', 'details', 'rather', 'simpler', 'more', 'innocent', 'smooth', 'finish', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'seeing', 'Gromit', 'know', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'more', 'detail', 'mouth', 'nose', 'cat', 'been', 'upgraded', 'sort', 'wolverine/bear', 'critter', 'cat', 'claws', 'bigger', 'role', 'season', '2', 'season', '1', 'few', 'changes', 'were', 'probably', 'good', 'idea', 'think', 'changes', 'characters', 'appearances', 'were', 'more', 'distracting', 'beneficial', 'mentioned', 'changes', 'made', 'characters', 'less', 'innocent', 'looking', 'well', 'missed', 'most', 'old', 'versions.3', 'One', 'things', 'totally', 'cracked', 'up', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'way', 'Blitzer', 'whistle', 'occasionally', 'out', 'yellow', 'red', 'cards', 'just', 'soccer', 'football', 'referee', 'Sadly', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'REALLY', 'miss', 'that.Anyway', 'changes', 'aside', 'series', 'still', 'worth', 'look', 'especially', 'still', 'have', 'children', 'house', 'Oh', 'still', 'love', 'pigs', 'sheet', 'still', 'things', 'time', 'time', 'hilarious', 'animation', 'still', 'fun', 'fresh', 'changes', 'aside', 'still', 'solid', '4-star', 'offering', 'considering', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'three', 'original', 'adventures', 'being', '5', 'stars', '.If', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'Season', '1', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'Season', '2', 'well.Keep', 'good', 'work']",Shaun the Sheep - Complete Series 2 anglais

None of them have ill intentions, except for the pigs who are the antagonists.  I am and always will be a huge fan of season one.Season two, however, is a stark change from season one and the humor has changed from simple wit and charm to offensive humor.  The nature of the characters have changed as well, as now it is not simply Shaun trying to have fun, coming up with a plan, and then shenanigans ensuing.  The second season makes every character to be a manipulative opportunist, including the dog, each of the sheep including Shaun, and even the cat.  If I wanted to watch television with a bunch of jerks I'd just watch regular television.In the second season I saw Shaun flip the bird (as in his middle finger,) the flock sabotage each other, and the farmer try to make a buck off of some ducks on his farm.  The first season showed the flock to be united, the farmer was not THAT opportunistic, and there were definitely no middle fingers.  In the first season it shows that everyone listens to Shaun and likes and respects him, whereas in season two the flock and the dog at one point are laughing at him and gesturing that he's crazy.It is a sad change and the show lost all of its heart in Season 2.",2,"Huge Fan of Season One, Not a Fan of Season Two",1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,1349,"['first', 'season', 'Shaun', 'Sheep', 'brilliant', 'simple', 'stories', 'genuine', 'wit', 'charm', 'innocence', 'plots', 'characters', 'None', 'have', 'ill', 'intentions', 'pigs', 'who', 'are', 'antagonists', 'am', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'huge', 'fan', 'season', 'one.Season', 'two', 'however', 'stark', 'change', 'season', 'one', 'humor', 'changed', 'simple', 'wit', 'charm', 'offensive', 'humor', 'nature', 'characters', 'have', 'changed', 'as', 'well', 'now', 'not', 'simply', 'Shaun', 'trying', 'have', 'fun', 'coming', 'up', 'plan', 'then', 'shenanigans', 'ensuing', 'second', 'season', 'character', 'be', 'manipulative', 'opportunist', 'including', 'dog', 'sheep', 'including', 'Shaun', 'even', 'cat', 'wanted', 'watch', 'television', 'bunch', 'jerks', ""'d"", 'just', 'watch', 'regular', 'television.In', 'second', 'season', 'saw', 'Shaun', 'flip', 'bird', 'middle', 'finger', 'flock', 'sabotage', 'other', 'farmer', 'try', 'make', 'buck', 'ducks', 'farm', 'first', 'season', 'showed', 'flock', 'be', 'united', 'farmer', 'was', 'not', 'THAT', 'opportunistic', 'were', 'definitely', 'middle', 'fingers', 'first', 'season', 'everyone', 'Shaun', 'likes', 'whereas', 'season', 'two', 'flock', 'dog', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'laughing', 'gesturing', 'crazy.It', 'sad', 'change', 'show', 'lost', 'heart', 'Season', '2']",Shaun the Sheep - Complete Series 2 anglais

Every character is charming, even the not-very-villainous villains, and the problems, snafus, and oopses come about and get resolved in an upbeat way.  The claymation is visually charming and very inventive; it's always a treat to see what unlikely thing they've managed to animate, and fun to try to imagine how they could possibly have done it.It is more oriented toward a child's level of attention than Nick Park's other hugely popular claymation winner, Wallace & Grommit, but would not be at all hard for an adult to sit through with his child.
