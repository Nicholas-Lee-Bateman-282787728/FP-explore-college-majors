I have heard several people sing 'My Way' but engelbert beats all the other's. The emotion he put's into this song is incredible. Every song on this disc is a winner and I even joined in singing along with his old favourites. Engelbert is awesome and as the concert title is totally amazing, this sums englebert.

The picture and sound quality of this product is the best of them all...and I know, because I own all of them!He is 71 now, and looking tired and often worn out.  He did not sing the old hits very well during this taping, however, he closed the show with an incredible version of ""My Way"".  Long overdue, he brought back his ultimate power to finish off a difficult song as only Humperdinck can....it brought back memories of his old concerts back in the late '70's, when he was powerful and truly gave every show ""his all""....lately, he has been on ""cruise control""....Finally, he gets five stars from me on this DVD for singing old obscure songs from his old LP's...such as ""The Last of the Romantics"" and ""Love Me With All of Your Heart"".If you are a Humperdinck fan...this is a must purchase!",5,5 stars for My Way....,1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,910,"['are', 'four', 'other', 'Engelbert', 'concert', 'DVD', 'available', 'there', 'purchase', 'latest', 'release', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'product', 'best', 'know', 'own', '71', 'now', 'looking', 'tired', 'often', 'worn', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'sing', 'old', 'hits', 'very', 'well', 'taping', 'however', 'closed', 'show', 'incredible', 'version', 'Way', 'Long', 'overdue', 'brought', 'back', 'ultimate', 'power', 'finish', 'off', 'difficult', 'song', 'only', 'Humperdinck', 'can', '.it', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'old', 'concerts', 'back', 'late', ""'70"", 'when', 'was', 'powerful', 'truly', 'gave', 'show', '.lately', 'been', 'cruise', 'control', '.Finally', 'five', 'stars', 'DVD', 'singing', 'old', 'obscure', 'songs', 'old', 'LP', 'such', 'Last', 'Romantics', 'Love', 'Me', 'All', 'Your', 'Heart', '.If', 'are', 'Humperdinck', 'fan', 'must', 'purchase']",Engelbert Humperdinck: Totally Amazing

The song lineup is great, new and old with an emphasis on the balads of course. The band is top notch, he is in full command of the audience and they love every minute of it. If you are just a passing fan or a die hard groupie, this concert will astound you and become a fav for a long time to come.

In my ""rockin"" years it was mostly because of the music but now i am learning to enjoy great vocalists. Elvis was the greatest entertainer to ever live and now i am discovering a hidden treasured talent in Engelbert. He has a powerful and smooth voice and i now know why he was so loved. This DVD catches him in his later career but his voice is still strong and his love of performing is still obvious. The best Engelbert DVD is the one titled Engelbert Live, the one that was conducted by Babe Salvetti and he begins the show with Love is a many Spledored Thing (better than anyone ever has ever sang it). My favorite cut on this DVD was Cry and Love me with all your Heart and do not miss the moving Columns of Gray on the bonus track.Any Engelebert recording CD or DVD is worth the money because when it comes to pure great vocals he and Tom Jones, Tony Bennett and Elvis cannot be outdone.",4,Discovering a treasure,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,1015,"['have', 'just', 'turned', 'fifty', 'i', 'am', 'discovering', 'new', 'appreciation', 'great', 'talent', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'days', 'rockin', 'years', 'was', 'mostly', 'music', 'now', 'am', 'learning', 'enjoy', 'great', 'vocalists', 'Elvis', 'was', 'greatest', 'entertainer', 'ever', 'live', 'now', 'i', 'am', 'discovering', 'hidden', 'treasured', 'talent', 'Engelbert', 'powerful', 'smooth', 'voice', 'i', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'loved', 'DVD', 'later', 'career', 'voice', 'still', 'strong', 'love', 'performing', 'still', 'obvious', 'best', 'Engelbert', 'DVD', 'one', 'titled', 'Engelbert', 'Live', 'one', 'was', 'conducted', 'Babe', 'Salvetti', 'show', 'Love', 'many', 'Spledored', 'Thing', 'better', 'anyone', 'ever', 'ever', 'sang', 'favorite', 'cut', 'DVD', 'was', 'Cry', 'Love', 'Heart', 'do', 'not', 'miss', 'moving', 'Columns', 'Gray', 'bonus', 'track.Any', 'Engelebert', 'recording', 'CD', 'DVD', 'money', 'when', 'pure', 'great', 'vocals', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'Elvis', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'outdone']",Engelbert Humperdinck: Totally Amazing
