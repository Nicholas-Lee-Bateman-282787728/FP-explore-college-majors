1550948,A1MFDFUGEVNIFK,B008DL4HXE,AyJay,"[1, 1]","Bait follows former lifeguard Josh as he arrives to his present day job at a supermarket, where he soon comes face to face with his ex Tina and her new boyfriend. Also having a less than great day is Josh's co-worker Ryan, who is fired after his girlfriend Jaime is caught shoplifting - oh, and the police officer called to the scene happens to be Jamie's father.An awkward day gets more dramatic when criminal Doyle and his accomplice hold up the supermarket, wrongly believing that the manager keeps the previous day takings in the office safe. The two gun-wielding robbers are soon locked in a standoff with the pissed-off officer and there is no resolution in sight...At which point the coastal community is hit by a tsunami, which completely floods the supermarket. The handful of survivors gather on top of the shelves and take stock of the situation, and soon notice that the water level is still slowly rising and inching closer to the now exposed electrical cables. So should everyone simply swim to safety? That option quickly becomes a NO, when our unlucky group realise that they are sharing the flooded and crumbling building with a 12 foot great white shark. So the question becomes whether to stay out of the water and be electrocuted/crushed/drowned before eventual help comes, or go into the water and risk getting munched on?Meanwhile... The supermarket has an attached underground supermarket, which is where Ryan was when when the tsunami hit. Climbing onto a pile of overturned cars to look for a possible exit, he comes across a young couple who also escaped injury or death and a unflooded stairwell. However there is another shark between the second unlucky group and said stairwell, so they are also left with the same choice as the group in the supermarket.***Julian McMahon [Profiler, Charmed, Nip/Tuck] was the only cast member who I was familiar with, but almost everyone else holds their own too [even the Twilight guy]. I only found the guy playing Kirby to be a bit dodgy - he tended towards Nic-Cage-overselling-it territory. Then again his character is a bit borderline, so maybe that is how he meant to play it? Anyway his character tends to keep quiet most of the time, so I didn't find him distracting and/or annoying.I don't know much about cinematography and stuff like that, so I can only say that I liked everything, and didn't notice any continuity errors. The sets were very realistic, the camera angle and underwater shots were great, the score was effective in it's minimalism, and the shots of the tsunami flooding the supermarket and carpark were brilliant - a big budget movie couldn't make the effects any better.I didn't think the sharks looked any less real than they do in any other movie of this type - and yes, I'm including good old Bruce in that observation. I'll also point out that BAIT was filmed to be viewed in 3D for it's Australia and Asia theatre run, so maybe that makes a difference to how the CGI looks on the 2D version?The only real problem that I had was how the film would suddenly go from serious  drama when we focused on the group in the store, then swing to more comedic territory when we checked in on the threesome in the underground carpark. Sometimes this dual effect thing works, but in other parts of the film I found the effect pretty jarring. Maybe the script writers should have allowed a bit more humour to carry through to the store survivors too, as I kinda felt as though I was watching two films at times.Also, can't we give the poor great whites a break from being the terrorizers in movies? Bull sharks regularly enter shallow water and are highly territorial and aggressive, so I'd have found it the sharks behaviour more believable if the filmmakers had used them instead.",4,Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the seafood section...,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,3765,"['Bait', 'former', 'lifeguard', 'Josh', 'present', 'day', 'job', 'supermarket', 'where', 'soon', 'face', 'face', 'ex', 'Tina', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Also', 'having', 'less', 'great', 'day', 'Josh', 'co-worker', 'Ryan', 'who', 'fired', 'girlfriend', 'Jaime', 'caught', 'shoplifting', 'oh', 'police', 'officer', 'called', 'scene', 'be', 'Jamie', 'father.An', 'awkward', 'day', 'more', 'dramatic', 'when', 'criminal', 'Doyle', 'accomplice', 'hold', 'up', 'supermarket', 'wrongly', 'believing', 'manager', 'previous', 'day', 'takings', 'office', 'safe', 'two', 'gun-wielding', 'robbers', 'are', 'soon', 'locked', 'standoff', 'pissed-off', 'officer', 'resolution', 'sight', 'point', 'coastal', 'community', 'hit', 'tsunami', 'completely', 'floods', 'supermarket', 'handful', 'survivors', 'gather', 'top', 'shelves', 'take', 'stock', 'situation', 'soon', 'notice', 'water', 'level', 'still', 'slowly', 'rising', 'inching', 'closer', 'now', 'exposed', 'electrical', 'cables', 'So', 'should', 'everyone', 'simply', 'safety', 'option', 'quickly', 'NO', 'when', 'unlucky', 'group', 'realise', 'are', 'sharing', 'flooded', 'crumbling', 'building', '12', 'foot', 'great', 'white', 'shark', 'question', 'stay', 'water', 'be', 'electrocuted/crushed/drowned', 'eventual', 'help', 'go', 'water', 'risk', 'getting', 'munched', 'Meanwhile', 'supermarket', 'attached', 'underground', 'supermarket', 'where', 'Ryan', 'was', 'when', 'when', 'tsunami', 'hit', 'Climbing', 'pile', 'overturned', 'cars', 'look', 'possible', 'exit', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'also', 'escaped', 'injury', 'death', 'unflooded', 'stairwell', 'However', 'shark', 'second', 'unlucky', 'group', 'said', 'stairwell', 'are', 'also', 'left', 'same', 'choice', 'group', 'supermarket', '***Julian', 'McMahon', '[', 'Profiler', 'Charmed', 'Nip/Tuck', ']', 'was', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'who', 'was', 'familiar', 'almost', 'everyone', 'else', 'own', 'too', '[', 'even', 'Twilight', 'guy', ']', 'only', 'found', 'guy', 'playing', 'Kirby', 'be', 'bit', 'dodgy', 'tended', 'towards', 'Nic-Cage-overselling-it', 'territory', 'Then', 'again', 'character', 'bit', 'borderline', 'so', 'maybe', 'how', 'meant', 'play', 'Anyway', 'character', 'keep', 'quiet', 'most', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'distracting', 'and/or', 'annoying.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'cinematography', 'stuff', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'liked', 'everything', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'continuity', 'errors', 'sets', 'were', 'very', 'realistic', 'camera', 'angle', 'underwater', 'shots', 'were', 'great', 'score', 'was', 'effective', 'minimalism', 'shots', 'tsunami', 'flooding', 'supermarket', 'carpark', 'were', 'brilliant', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'effects', 'better.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'sharks', 'looked', 'less', 'real', 'do', 'other', 'movie', 'type', 'yes', ""'m"", 'including', 'good', 'old', 'Bruce', 'observation', ""'ll"", 'also', 'point', 'out', 'BAIT', 'was', 'filmed', 'be', 'viewed', '3D', 'Australia', 'Asia', 'theatre', 'run', 'so', 'maybe', 'difference', 'how', 'CGI', '2D', 'version', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'suddenly', 'go', 'serious', 'drama', 'when', 'focused', 'group', 'store', 'then', 'swing', 'more', 'comedic', 'territory', 'when', 'checked', 'threesome', 'underground', 'carpark', 'Sometimes', 'dual', 'effect', 'thing', 'works', 'other', 'parts', 'film', 'found', 'effect', 'pretty', 'jarring', 'Maybe', 'script', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'allowed', 'bit', 'more', 'humour', 'carry', 'store', 'survivors', 'too', 'kinda', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'two', 'films', 'times.Also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'poor', 'great', 'break', 'being', 'terrorizers', 'movies', 'Bull', 'regularly', 'enter', 'shallow', 'water', 'are', 'highly', 'territorial', 'aggressive', ""'d"", 'have', 'found', 'sharks', 'behaviour', 'more', 'believable', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'used', 'instead']",N/A

1550950,A2582KMXLK2P06,B008DL4HXE,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","While it would be very easy to dismiss Bait as another ""shark attacks innocent people"" type thriller, this movie actually takes this tired old idea in a slightly different direction.  Not only that, but when you watch the first 20 minutes, you're not sure where exactly it's going- first you see sharks attack people (rather unrealistically due to unnecessary cheesy effects actually lessening the severity of the attacks- NOT what the producers were going for I imagine), then you see a tsunami wipe out an entire town (which DOES appear realistic, more so than most natural disaster-type movies that usually exaggerate the destruction too much), and finally a robbery taking place inside a grocery store with guns and action.  This is a LOT of excitement in just a short amount of time.You're not initially sure, at least I wasn't, where this movie's going.  You're basically given a choice between several different ideas.  Too bad they had to go and put a shark with his mouth wide open on the box cover- would have been a MUCH better idea to rename the movie without showing a shark as a clever way to surprise viewers.Well eventually it becomes obvious that this is indeed a shark movie but... these people aren't stranded at sea.  They're stuck inside a grocery store.  When it becomes apparent a dangerous great white shark is lurking inside the flooded store, the survivors have to do whatever they can to survive.  Most of the time the people stay on top of the shelves since apparently only being a few feet above the water is enough to go undetected by the shark (which is hilarious because later on, a guy who's positioned much higher on a rope during an escape attempt becomes an easy target for the shark).Also, another man and woman (a couple) are trapped inside a car in a flooded parking area, and the story focuses on these two as well.  I wasn't really sure if there was one or two sharks roaming the area due to two separate locations being giving attention... but I guess we find out by the conclusion.Another thing I like is that the people you'd think would die due to the circumstances in a few segments... well without spoiling it, minor twists pertaining to ""who lives and who dies"" happen along the way.  Minor twists at best, admittedly.  The acting is probably questionable sometimes- I felt that all the excitement and confusion in the first 20 minutes, while exciting to watch, didn't exactly offer the best character development or the greatest of acting skills (such as the one robber demanding money out of a locked safe... that part was WAY too tame!)  Due to the lack of interesting characters, you really don't care about the drama/relationships involving the young men and women later on and who ends up hooking up with who.Well Bait offered me a pretty good amount of entertainment, but other than the location being in a grocery store instead of the open sea, this isn't much different from other shark movies.  Still, when you factor in the robbers (who survive the tsunami of course) and that they place a minor role in making this shark movie different from several other ones (more of a role towards the end in fact- they were surprisingly quiet and unthreatening throughout the film while the shark was swimming around but I guess that's reasonable) this is a pretty good film.  I highly recommend it.",4,fairly unique believe it or not,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,3347,"['would', 'be', 'very', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'Bait', 'shark', 'attacks', 'innocent', 'people', 'type', 'thriller', 'movie', 'actually', 'tired', 'old', 'idea', 'slightly', 'different', 'direction', 'Not', 'only', 'when', 'watch', 'first', '20', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'exactly', 'going-', 'first', 'see', 'sharks', 'attack', 'people', 'rather', 'unrealistically', 'due', 'unnecessary', 'cheesy', 'effects', 'actually', 'lessening', 'severity', 'attacks-', 'NOT', 'what', 'producers', 'were', 'going', 'imagine', 'then', 'see', 'tsunami', 'wipe', 'entire', 'town', 'DOES', 'appear', 'realistic', 'more', 'so', 'most', 'natural', 'disaster-type', 'movies', 'usually', 'exaggerate', 'destruction', 'too', 'much', 'finally', 'robbery', 'taking', 'place', 'grocery', 'store', 'guns', 'action', 'LOT', 'excitement', 'just', 'short', 'amount', 'time.You', ""'re"", 'not', 'initially', 'sure', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'where', 'movie', 'going', ""'re"", 'basically', 'given', 'choice', 'several', 'different', 'ideas', 'Too', 'bad', 'had', 'go', 'put', 'shark', 'mouth', 'wide', 'open', 'box', 'cover-', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'MUCH', 'better', 'idea', 'rename', 'movie', 'showing', 'shark', 'clever', 'way', 'surprise', 'viewers.Well', 'eventually', 'obvious', 'indeed', 'shark', 'movie', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'stranded', 'sea', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'grocery', 'store', 'When', 'apparent', 'dangerous', 'great', 'white', 'shark', 'lurking', 'flooded', 'store', 'survivors', 'have', 'do', 'can', 'survive', 'Most', 'time', 'people', 'stay', 'top', 'shelves', 'apparently', 'only', 'being', 'few', 'feet', 'water', 'enough', 'go', 'undetected', 'shark', 'hilarious', 'later', 'guy', 'who', 'positioned', 'much', 'higher', 'rope', 'escape', 'attempt', 'easy', 'target', 'shark', '.Also', 'man', 'woman', 'couple', 'are', 'trapped', 'car', 'flooded', 'parking', 'area', 'story', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'sharks', 'roaming', 'area', 'due', 'two', 'separate', 'locations', 'being', 'giving', 'attention', 'guess', 'find', 'out', 'conclusion.Another', 'thing', 'like', 'people', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'die', 'due', 'circumstances', 'few', 'segments', 'well', 'spoiling', 'minor', 'twists', 'pertaining', 'who', 'who', 'happen', 'way', 'Minor', 'twists', 'best', 'admittedly', 'acting', 'probably', 'questionable', 'sometimes-', 'felt', 'excitement', 'confusion', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'exciting', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'offer', 'best', 'character', 'development', 'greatest', 'acting', 'skills', 'such', 'one', 'robber', 'demanding', 'money', 'locked', 'safe', 'part', 'was', 'WAY', 'too', 'tame', 'Due', 'lack', 'interesting', 'characters', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'drama/relationships', 'involving', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'later', 'who', 'up', 'hooking', 'up', 'who.Well', 'Bait', 'offered', 'pretty', 'good', 'amount', 'entertainment', 'other', 'location', 'being', 'grocery', 'store', 'instead', 'open', 'sea', ""n't"", 'much', 'different', 'other', 'shark', 'movies', 'Still', 'when', 'factor', 'robbers', 'who', 'survive', 'tsunami', 'course', 'place', 'minor', 'role', 'making', 'shark', 'movie', 'different', 'several', 'other', 'ones', 'more', 'role', 'end', 'fact-', 'were', 'surprisingly', 'quiet', 'unthreatening', 'film', 'shark', 'was', 'swimming', 'guess', 'reasonable', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

1550960,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B008DL4HXE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 7]","So, you want more shark attack films!With Anchor Bay Entertainment's  ""Jersey Shore Shark Attack"" around the corner, coming out on Sept. 18th is the Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray and DVD combo release of the Australian film,""Bait 3D"".Featuring the directorial debut of Kimble Rendall (who worked as second unit director for ""The Matrix"" films, ""I, Robot"", ""Ghost Rider"" and ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans""), ""Bait 3D"" stars Julian McMahon (""Nip/Tuck"", ""Fantastic Four"" films, ""Home and Away""), Sharni Vinson (""Step Up 3D"", ""Blue Crush 2&#8243;, ""Home and Away""), Xavier Samuel (""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"", ""Anonymous""), Phoebe Tonkin (""The Secret Circle"", ""Tomorrow, When the War Began"") and Alex Russell (""Almost Kings"").""Bait"" is a film set in a beach community and introduces us to a young couple, lifeguard Josh (portrayed by Xavier Samuel) and his fiance, Tina (portrayed by Sharni Vinson).  While the two are enjoying their time together at a beach, a shark attack off-shore leads to the death of several people.  With Tina's brother, Rory, is out in the sea, Josh tries to quickly get out to sea and save him.  Unfortunately, right when Josh gets there, Tina's brother is attacked and killed by the shark.The film then fast forwards a year later.  We see how Josh has been affected by the death of Rory and his engagement to Tina is now over.  As we see him leaving home, he notices that the dogs are acting crazy and birds are behaving strangely as if they are trying to escape to another destination rather quickly.We learn that Josh no longer is a lifeguard and works at a local grocery store as a stocker.At this grocery store, we are then introduced to a variety of people.  We are first introduced to a troubled shoplifter named Jaimie (portrayed by Phoebe Tonkin), who steals from the local grocery store and tries to impress her boyfriend Ryan (portrayed by Alex Russell), who works in the backroom of the grocery store on the computers.  Jaimie gets busted for shoplifting  by the store manager (portrayed by Adrian Pang) and her father Todd (portrayed by Martin Sacks), a police officer is upset that his daughter got into trouble and is showing no remorse.  Todd knows that his relationship with his daughter is strained but doesn't know what else he can do for her and decides, maybe it's best if he charges his daughter with a crime and so, a day in jail may make her think about committing another crime.Meanwhile, as Josh is at work.  He runs into his ex-girlfriend Tina who is accompanied by her new boyfriend, Steve (portrayed by Qi Yuwu) from Singapore.Out in the parking lot, we are introduced to a wealthy young couple, Kyle (portrayed by Lincoln Lewis) and Heather (portrayed by Cariba Heine), who park outside the grocery store's car port, so they can make out.  We are also introduced to Doyle (portrayed by Julian McMahon) and Kirby (portrayed by Dan Wylie) who are plotting a major robbery of the grocery store.As the two men try to rob the bank and threaten to kill people who are inside.  A major earthquake takes place and not too long after, a tsunami hits the beach community.  Inside the grocery store, many lives are lost but ten manage to survive, while a couple manage to survive submerged inside their locked car out in the  car port.Knowing that they must find a way out of the submerged grocery store, as a few try to look for an exit, the dead bodies that were once floating around the store suddenly are being pulled down.  Everyone quickly learns that a killer 12 ft. great white shark is now inside the grocery store, while another great white shark is swimming inside the parking garage.And the survivors of the tsunami stuck inside the grocery store have now become the hunted.With the people trapped above the shelves and are trying to survive from the shark, to make things worse, aftershocks from the earthquake have now led electric wires fall from the ceiling and are dangerously close to touching the water and electrocuting everyone.With hardly any options left, the survivors must find a way to disable the power but also stay alive as the sharks circles around the area looking for food.VIDEO:""Bait 3D"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  While the outdoor island scenes are gorgeous and beautiful, once the earthquake and tsunami hits, most of the shots are shot in a parking garage and one section of a grocery store.  The lighting for the film is still good, character closeups feature plenty of detail. Actually, I have to say that picture quality is fantastic.As mentioned, closeups show amazing detail from the beads of water from the characters.  Despite being underground, there is a good enough light shining from the windows to the grocery store, so lighting and colors are still good.  Black levels are nice and deep and I personally didn't notice any banding issues or artifacts.While certain scenes look very good involving the shark under and over-water, there were some inconsistency with CG.  Some looking very nice and some looking as if it wasn't rendered all that well.  Especially the final few seconds of the film, which was probably a good use of 3D but picture quality-wise, it didn't look all that great.As for the 3D portion of the film, there are some interesting uses of 3D.  One at the beginning of the film featuring Tina's brother and a shark coming at him and throwing him up in the air, to body parts, debris, blood, birds and fish flying towards the camera.  The problem is that there are not enough shock factors of 3D.  There is only so much you can see of body parts and blood coming at you.  Granted, being stuck in a confined space leaves your choices to a minimum but 3D is used, but its use becomes more repetitive than exciting.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Bait 3D"" is presented in Dolby TrueHD 7.1.  For a 7.1 lossless soundtrack, I was expecting immersiveness.  Dialogue and music is crystal clear but during the action scenes, while I noticed a really good use of LFE, I was hoping to hear more directional uses of the surround and rear surround channels.  I didn't really hear too much use of the surround channels and that was a bit of a disappointment as I had high expectations because of the featured 7.1 lossless track.Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Bait 3D"" comes with the following special features:Storyboard Gallery  - Using your remote, you can cycle through various storyboards for the film.EXTRAS:""Bait 3D"" comes with a Blu-ray 3D version of the film, a Blu-ray version of the film and also a DVD (presented in 1:78:1, Dolby Digital 5.1).JUDGMENT CALL:Let's face it!  There are people who love shark attack films or even shows that relate to sharks.But while we have had our fair share in recent years with horror films featuring killer piranhas, snakes and other things, it's been awhile since we had seen a horror film involving shark and here we are with the independent film, ""Bait 3D"".""Bait 3D"" is an interesting shark film with a nod to B-horror flicks.  Featuring stars such as Julian McMahon, Sharni Vinson and Xavier Samuel, ""Bait 3D"" is a predictable film and although it has its fair share of horror elements, the film combines humor, bad acting and a CG elements that looked good at times but also bad.I enjoyed how the film started out and the story behind Josh and Tina was rather cool. I loved the idea of two lovers separated because of tragedy but to discover each other, a story could have been better created if it focused on the two.  Rather than this ensemble cast which seemed to be thrown into the film primarily as shark fodder.  And problem with the storyline is that with so many characters, the writers leave Josh and Tina and try to explore characters that come off as one-dimensional and not interesting at all.For example, aside from Josh and Tina, we are introduced to another couple, Ryan and Jaimie.  Ryan gets trapped with others in the parking garage, away from Jaimie, so it kind of takes away any interested of their relationship, unlike Josh and Tina as it builds throughout the film.Also, the film tries to juggle its use of Julian McMahon's character of Doyle.  Bad guy or good guy?  While he does play an important part in the film, his character could have been fleshed out more.I understand that this is a shark film and deaths must occur, but its important for characters that you love or hate drive the emotion of the film, otherwise, no one cares and you just want to see them die a gruesome death.While I did have problems with this film, I admit that the idea of a shark film at a grocery store, submerged after a tsunami is quite interesting.  And while some scenes I saw as laughable and generic, its use of the characters made it seem so B-film, you just wonder how ridiculous their deaths will be.You have the two Asian characters, Steven (portrayed by Qi Yuwu) and the grocery store manager (portrayed by Adrian Pang) and following the usual Hollywood-style horror script towards non-White characters, even though an Australian film, you know they are not going to live (in some ways, I was hoping this film would prove me wrong, but as most horror films go, the person of color never lives to see the day in a horror film).Then you have two materialistic blondes stuck inside their car bickering about nonsense. These two characters were so annoying, I personally was hoping the shark would eat them.You can tell already when you see the 12 survivors of who is going to be shark food.  It's too predictable and the writers played this film a bit too pedestrian for my taste.  There were no surprising deaths, the film was effete and instead of being suspenseful, you put your hope on the veteran actor Julian McMahon or Xavier Samuel to save this film.The 3D for the film was OK.  You have big budget films that have the means to make the 3D look effective but there is only so much you can get away with body parts and fish coming towards the camera.  There are a few moments where the 3D is good, but unfortunately some CG scenes don't look that great.The look of the film on Blu-ray was fantastic as the colors were vibrant and the film looked gorgeous.  While inside the grocery store and parking garage, you are limited to the darkness and confined space.  While dialogue and music were crystal clear via lossless, I was hoping a bit more immersiveness through the 7.1 lossless soundtrack.  Another bummer was the lack of special features.  Sure, it has a storyboard gallery but no interviews or any featurettes on the making of the film.I did like the fact that Anchor Bay Entertainment included the Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray and thrown in DVD with this release.Overall, ""Bait 3D"" is a B-film shark attack movie. Is it terrible?  No.  Is it great?  Definitely not.  But for those who want to be entertained, well, if you love these shark attack/survival films, ""Bait 3D"" maybe worth checking out.  It's not that scary and the film has its fair share of problems.But for those who don't need a deep storyline and just want to see people get killed, bodies being ripped apart and their blood and body parts coming at you via 3D, then no doubt that you may enjoy ""Bait 3D"".  If you are looking for a shark attack film on Blu-ray with action and humor (although possibly not intentional), then ""Bait 3D"" is a popcorn action/horror film worth your time!",3,"""Bait 3D"" is a popcorn action/horror film that is for the most part...OK.",1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,11341,"['So', 'want', 'more', 'shark', 'attack', 'films', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'Jersey', 'Shore',

I should've quit ahead when the shark bursts through a surfboard (cracking it in half) and jumping 30ft into the air roaring. So a tsunami hits Australia and a grocery store during a robbery gets hit and floods partway, and when the survivors get together and try to figure out a way to the surface a big great white shark is stuck in the grocery store with them and terrorizes them. Sounds like a winning formula right? Well it was pretty entertaining if you like shark attack movies, so the scenes with the shark and people avoiding the shark were sorta fun, but what was anything but good was the other 95%, the human drama.We have a few different kind of characters in this movie. We have generic looking white heroes who say positive stuff like ""c'mon guys stop fighting, we need to get outta here"" and do almost everything themselves. We have the negative survivors that sit around and bitch saying stuff like ""We'll never make it"" or ""why don't we just give up now"". Finally we have neutral martyrs that decide to help at the last minute and die, and are promptly forgotten about. Such is life of a neutral. A police-father in this has a leg injury and grabs one of the generic white kids by the shoulders and grunts ""help... my... daughter..."" or a criminal-turned gruff good guy who says ""I'm foindin' us a way outta here"". My point is the characters suck.Also by the end it turns out that the great white shark was also a part time relationship counselor:-a girl was in a relationship with a jerk, so the shark ate the jerk and let her and her dog live so that she can ponder why she chooses the men she does-An estranged ex-couple are brought back together when the well-meaning new boyfriend dies, and they wouldn't have likely sat down and talked if it weren't for the whole tsunami/great white situation-great white teaches one of the robbers that he does in fact have a heart of gold, and hooks him up with one of the store clerks while he's at it! Yowza!-Also the shark teaches a selfish girl to be self-less by the end of it and appreciate her fellow man, as well as allowing her father to witness what a good person she's becoming.Wow, move over Dr. Phil!So yeah the shark parts were fun but the 95% of people talking was mind-numbingly cliche.

1550976,AIO247KHD2O40,B008DL4HXE,James N Simpson,"[1, 1]","I don't think anyone buying Bait is expecting it to be a documentary style accurate with real life shark behaviour or well too realistic in any way at all. I mean we know it's about a shark in a flooded due to a tsunami supermarket, so yeah you do need to suspend belief watching it and believe that a couple of sharks would ignore all the freely available corpses to munch on and become horror slasher movie style killers desperate to pick off the human survivors trapped on top of the shelves one by one. Like Snakes on a Plane for example, Bait is just pure entertainment! It's a movie about sharks determined to kill every human in a flooded supermarket and delivers exactly that plot.Wasn't overall as cheesy as I had anticipated.  There is a really bad CGI shark at the beginning of the film while we're still out in the ocean after a Jaws opening rip off/homage (they use a fat old guy instead of a beautiful naked woman) but once the Tsunami floods the supermarket and its car park underneath, the originality of this take on the shark slasher flick kicks in, and the sharks although still obviously fake, become a bit more realistic looking. The makers are also obviously cashing in on the success of the Bondi Rescue documentary lifeguard series TV show, with the use of that council's rescue boards instead of the Gold Coast's or the usual Surf Club ones.  Possibly they simply used it due to save on the budget since the Bondi Rescue show already has one with a camera on the front, so then why make your own if you can borrow one.  This low budget movie was filmed in Coolangatta, the most southern suburb of the Australian city the Gold Coast, especially the underground car park (shot in the shopping centre Showcase on the Beach), as well as at Warner Brothers studios in the northern suburbs for the supermarket scenes.  Bait highlights the suburb of Coolangatta quite well and accurately portrays the laid back beach lifestyle of locals there and similar Australian suburbs and towns. I liked how they didn't try and occa the people up Crocodile Dundee and similar movie style, but that they came across as everyday Australians, and included the multicultural aspect of Australian society as well in the characters.Not sure about the American versions but the Australian DVD comes with the making of feature as an extra.  That's where you learn this was actually shot as a 3D film for the cinemas.  Possibly the sharks looked better in 3D than 2D, but if I hadn't known there was a 3D version I never would have noticed, the 2D result looks normal on the screen.Although there are a couple of washed up actors from Australian TV shows such as Home and Away and Blue Heelers, the acting overall was decent enough for this sort of film. For some reason some actors put on fake American accents while the rest spoke in their natural Australian voices.

1550980,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B008DL4HXE,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","A simple not-too-over-the-top story, tolerable acting, some really fun kills and floating body parts make this well worth a low budget watch.The story is simple.  After a tsunami ravages an Australian beach town, survivors are trapped in a grocery store with a hungry great white shark.  The setting makes for a nice change of pace amid the shark movie extravaganza that has filled the last decade (e.g., Sharktopus, Mega Shark, Sharknado, Sand Sharks, Megalodon, Megashark vs. Giant Crocosaurus, Snow Shark, Megashark vs. Giant Octopus, Jersey Shore Shark Attack, Dinoshark, Attack of the Jurassic Shark, Jaws in Japan, Ghost Shark,  Malibu Shark Attack, Super Shark, Swamp Shark, 12 Days of Terror, Two-Headed shark Attack, Shark Swarm, Sharks in Venice, Spring Break Shark Attack, Shark Attack in the Mediterranean, Open Water, Red Water, The Reef, Hammerhead...need I go on?).This is a bit more than a group of scantily clad brainless chicks and over-sexed underwear model punks against some sharks.  Tina ( Sharni Vinson; You're Next) and her ex-fianc&eacute;e Rory (Xavier Samuel) are among the survivors.  They're real people with real problems and real feelings.  A criminal (Julian McMahon) and a young juvenile delinquent are among the dozen survivors, so naturally there is some bickering about trust issues.  But we don't find ourselves too bogged down by their simple dynamic.  Some of the acting is pretty bad, but at least Sharni Vinson holds her own throughout (though not with a lead role or a breakout performance like she did in You're Next) and Julian McMahon is also consistent.Once the action starts, the girls are not in bathing suits and everyone keep their shirts on.  Lending a bit more credibility to the movie, rather unflatteringly the girls are clothed and wet with stringy hair and all most of the time; far from dolled up.  They also come up with some neat ideas, including a believable improvised diving suit caged for shark bite resistance and tubed for respiration.  Even when predictable, a couple of the kills were especially entertaining.  They also made good use of a cute dog.Director Kimble Rendall has little experience being in charge, but has an impressive resume as a second unit director including two of the Matrix movies, I, Robot (2004), Killer Elite (2011) and Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009), so I'd expect he's learned a bit about building tension and action.  His skills translated well in Bait--understanding his budget limitations.There's a mixed bag of terrible to acceptable CGI wound and shark effects.  But really fun anyway.  Latex and prosthetics work were easily ""good enough,"" but what saves the movie's effects are the humorously placed severed parts. Whether bobbing in the water or drifting asunder, there's plenty to entertain.  But, by the end you'll find yourself wondering just how many people a 12-foot shark can eat before it gets full.All in all, well worth a low budget watch.  Stay for the credits!

Now all I can ask myself is that if it can be just as much fun and excitement or even more than that of Snakes on a Plane! Bait consists of a few major flaws (One being the cars not flooding instantly when completely submerged underwater) but other than that factor and a small amount of scenes featuring bad CGI, It was a not only a fun and exciting time but also a suspenseful and gory thrill ride!Plot: As said before, it is about a tsunami consuming an entire city and a group of survivors must band together to try and survive this tragedy..... But if things were not bad enough there are two twelve foot great white sharks (one feasts on survivors in the supermarket and one attacks survivors down below in a parking lot) just adding to the tension! I thought they used there plots and stories very well, they were done right and even paid some homage's to films such as Cujo (The Car Being Attacked), The Mist (The Supermarket Setting) and Even Rogue (Mainly for it's survival tone but also for having a lot of characters and killing off so few is my reason why I chose Rogue over any other survival movie to compare it to!). I believe the best thing about the plot is that it is so small and yet so epic that it can't really have any plot-holes! The Plot works and it works to its full extent!Review: The movie can be considered as an either you love it or hate it kind of movie, but even if you don't like it say because of the survival story it still adds things that most survival movies don't and that Is tons of grisly gore.... But if you'd rather watch a movie filled with suspense, decent characters and perfect character development down time and don't mind having grisly gore to go along then this movie will work for you to! Basically the only reason this movie wouldn't be for you is if you despised or couldn't handle/tolerate grisly gore! This movie literally only has one bad actor, one or two bad CGI scenes and some flaws. I didn't notice any continuity errors while watching this flick. This movie does have a 3D version which I haven't seen but I actually wouldn't mind in doing so. This film is in my top five favorite shark flicks and it'll most likely stay like that for a couple of years unless, by some miracle they make a MEG movie (based tightly on the 1997 novel) then I'd probably adore that more hopefully!Acting: There is really only one bad actor which I did mention but I am not sure if that is because he is supposed to be crazy or what, but with the rest of the actors I really had no problem with their skills in creating great dialogue and emotions, In the emotions departments there were a few slip ups but they can easily be forgiven! You care about the characters and I didn't want some of them to get eaten, but a couple of them I wouldn't have minded to seeing the extra gore for their death considerably quicker!Gore: Fun, Grisly and Disturbing.... Lots of grisly and disturbing mangled corpses including people who have been crushed, decapitated, and lost limbs that are now float around everywhere; a man is torn in half in one of the most intense yet predictable ways I've seen in a long time. Lots of blood, a bloody spear and hook impalement and some more! It really never let down in this department!Bottom Line: Aside from some minor and a very few major problems, little bad CGI moments, and a bad actor this film really has a lot going for it. It even got a limited theatrical release.... It'll most likely not make a profit for its budget was $30,000,000 (according to IMDB) and it has been released in only limited theaters but I do hope they come up with an idea for a sequel. Some places (such as a mall or even a restaurant) could still be flooded and be infested with sharks....

Even if the &#34;event&#34; hadn't happened I would've still been interested in the lives of these people, although that probubly wouldn't attract many people. Also, a big plus for this movie was that the characters actually felt like they could stand up to the shark and while a couple were less useful they didn't act stupidly.

1551027,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B008DL4HXE,trebe,"[0, 2]","Another entry in the popular ""shark film"" genre, Bait 3D (2012) isn't very serious, or completely original, but it does feature some interesting ideas, as a seaside town in Australia is struck by a tsunami, and the huge wave propels a pair of great white sharks ashore, where they become trapped in the flooded parking garage of the Oceania Food Mart.  On an upper floor, the supermarket is also flooded, and the group of people trapped inside, standing on the top of display shelves and refrigerated cabinets, soon discover that something very hungry is in the water.  The 3D aspect is another interesting feature, which usually involves the gaping jaws of the shark heading into the camera.Although mostly a fun and darkly humorous B-movie, the film does feature some quality special effects, with the scenes of the tsunami striking the shore and flooding the building, and the film's closing shots, being particularly impactful.  The shark isn't seen a lot, but looks realistic enough, and you should feel on edge, whenever anyone is in the water.  A great deal of the action takes place either in or under the water, and these scenes are also handled very nicely.Those trapped in the store make an interesting group, as a robbery was in progress when the tsunami struck.  There is a cop (Martin Sacks), his beautiful daughter (Phoebe Tonkin), her boyfriend (Alex Russell), and a suspected robber (Julian McMahon).  Also among the survivors is a store employee (Xavier Samuel), who is also former lifeguard, and his ex-girlfriend (Sharni Vinson), who's brother was killed by a shark.  There is a nice blend of younger characters and romance to appeal to teens, and older more experienced characters, who attempt to provide leadership.Besides the danger of the situation, there is also some tension from having a criminal present, and also from the emotional ties between some of the characters.  These interactions are a bit overdramatic at times, but it helps add to the atmosphere of a film which is mostly suspenseful, with some grimly funny moments, and a few surprises.  Early attempts to find a way out are rather silly, and have disastrous results.  Electricity, which is somehow still available, is a key factor in what happens, as Bait 3D is an entertaining, although not entirely original shark tale.Julian McMahon (Nip/Tuck,Profiler), is a familiar face among a mostly Australian cast, giving the film some class.

The story is silly, but the film is fun nonetheless. And there is a great scene involving Samuel L. Jackson that you will never forget.Australian film &#8220;Bait,&#8221; directed by Kimble Rendall (&#8220;Cut&#8221;), is set in a similar situation, but moves its setting to a flooded supermarket right after a tsunami hits the coast. A group of survivors including a former lifeguard Josh (Xavier Samuel) and his ex-girlfriend Tina (Sharni Vinson) attempts to escape from the heavily damaged building, but one of the big obstacles is a huge man-eating shark lurking somewhere in the water that surrounds them.&#8220;Bait&#8221; is a reasonably enjoyable low-budget action movie, but don&#8217;t expect too much.

1551031,A2ONX15N6TWDR,B008DL4HXE,Vincenzo L.,"[17, 17]","Since the SyFy channel purchased whatever special effects machine it is they use to crank out film after film, there has certainly been no shortage on bad shark movies: VENICE SHARK ATTACK, TWO-HEADED SHARK ATTACK, SAND SHARK, MEGASHARK, MAGASHARK VS GIANT OCTOPUS, etc, etc...  The CGI used to generate these beasts is usually cartoonish at best, but not so much so here, I think the Aussies have something magical, fun and scary in equal parts with BAIT.While this isn't the first movie that floods the coastal cities with a tsunami, and than lets loose nature's greatest killing machines on hapless survivors, the shark(s) in BAIT provide a great combination of thrills and anxiety with their presence.I personally found the story to be entertaining, and the characters to be believable.  The idea of being trapped in a flooded shopping mall with a great white shark was entertaining enough, but the shark itself was truly impressive.  It provided some genuine scares, and the scenes leading up to an attack were tense and frightening in equal measure.  There was no shortage on gore either - the blood red water being churned as the shark would rend its victims was well done.  The close ups - particularly when he would breach were well done, and if I am not mistaken, for at least one of the sharks, I certainly felt a slight homage towards the greatest of all shark films - JAWS (well - JAWS II at any rate)!!!This movie moves at a good pace, and leaps right in with both feet (forgive the pun), and will not disappoint.  If you like shark movies, than this one is for you.  Be sure to watch the credits too, as a great rendition of the Mac the Knife is played, and we are rewarded with one last scare.",4,"It's no JAWS, but it is a fun film!",1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,1709,"['SyFy', 'channel', 'purchased', 'special', 'effects', 'machine', 'use', 'crank', 'out', 'film', 'film', 'certainly', 'been', 'shortage', 'bad', 'shark', 'movies', 'VENICE', 'SHARK', 'ATTACK', 'TWO-HEADED', 'SHARK', 'ATTACK', 'SAND', 'SHARK', 'MEGASHARK', 'MAGASHARK', 'VS', 'GIANT', 'OCTOPUS', 'etc', 'etc', 'CGI', 'used', 'generate', 'beasts', 'usually', 'cartoonish', 'best', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'think', 'Aussies', 'have', 'something', 'magical', 'fun', 'scary', 'equal', 'parts', 'BAIT.While', ""n't"", 'first', 'movie', 'coastal', 'cities', 'tsunami', 'lets', 'loose', 'nature', 'greatest', 'killing', 'machines', 'hapless', 'survivors', 'shark', 's', 'BAIT', 'provide', 'great', 'combination', 'thrills', 'anxiety', 'presence.I', 'personally', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'be', 'believable', 'idea', 'being', 'trapped', 'flooded', 'shopping', 'mall', 'great', 'white', 'shark', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'shark', 'was', 'truly', 'impressive', 'provided', 'genuine', 'scares', 'scenes', 'leading', 'up', 'attack', 'were', 'tense', 'frightening', 'equal', 'measure', 'was', 'shortage', 'gore', 'blood', 'red', 'water', 'being', 'churned', 'shark', 'would', 'rend', 'victims', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'close', 'ups', 'particularly', 'when', 'would', 'breach', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'am', 'not', 'mistaken', 'least', 'one', 'sharks', 'certainly', 'felt', 'slight', 'homage', 'towards', 'greatest', 'shark', 'films', 'JAWS', 'well', 'JAWS', 'II', 'rate', 'movie', 'good', 'pace', 'leaps', 'right', 'feet', 'forgive', 'pun', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'like', 'shark', 'movies', 'one', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'credits', 'too', 'great', 'rendition', 'Mac', 'Knife', 'played', 'are', 'rewarded', 'one', 'last', 'scare']",N/A
