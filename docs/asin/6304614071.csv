429837,A1G75BA2MHXFUR,6304614071,Alan L Seals,"[6, 6]","The &quot;Inner Light&quot; is one of the most philosophical espisodes in  the series.  What would someone do if they woke up as a different person on  a different world?  It takes Picard about 5 years to realize that whatever  has happened to him, whether his other life aboard the Enterprise was real  or not, this is now his life and he will have to live with it.  Not that it  is a bad life.While Picard is actually unconscious on the bridge of the  enterprise, it seems that less than a minute passes there for each year  Picard &quot;lives&quot; on the planet.In his new life, he starts a  family with his wife, who he grows to love. He uses his scientific  knowledge to discover that the planet is dying of a drought brought on by  the early stages of the death of its sun.By the time he nears the end of  his life, he realizes that his grand kids will never live to be adults.  It  is not long before he will learn why he was brought here, and what happens  to his family and friends.One of the best moments for me was when, after  the birth of his second child, he states that he had never thought that he  needed children to make his life complete, but now he could not imagine his  life without them.  If he returns to the Enterprise, he will have to learn  to do just that.This episode also deepens Picard's character as it shows  his interaction with a family. It shows that though he will probably never  truly have a family of his own, he would make a great husband and father.",5,Patrick Stewart's Finest,962668800,"07 4, 2000",2000,1492,"['quot', 'Inner', 'Light', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'philosophical', 'espisodes', 'series', 'What', 'would', 'someone', 'do', 'woke', 'up', 'different', 'person', 'different', 'world', 'Picard', '5', 'years', 'realize', 'happened', 'other', 'life', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'real', 'not', 'now', 'life', 'will', 'have', 'live', 'Not', 'bad', 'life.While', 'Picard', 'actually', 'unconscious', 'bridge', 'enterprise', 'less', 'minute', 'passes', 'there', 'year', 'Picard', 'quot', 'quot', 'planet.In', 'new', 'life', 'family', 'wife', 'who', 'love', 'scientific', 'knowledge', 'discover', 'planet', 'dying', 'drought', 'brought', 'early', 'stages', 'death', 'sun.By', 'time', 'end', 'life', 'grand', 'kids', 'will', 'never', 'live', 'be', 'adults', 'not', 'long', 'will', 'learn', 'why', 'was', 'brought', 'here', 'what', 'family', 'friends.One', 'best', 'moments', 'was', 'when', 'birth', 'second', 'child', 'had', 'never', 'thought', 'needed', 'children', 'make', 'life', 'complete', 'now', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'life', 'Enterprise', 'will', 'have', 'learn', 'do', 'just', 'that.This', 'episode', 'also', 'Picard', 'character', 'interaction', 'family', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'truly', 'have', 'family', 'own', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'husband', 'father']","Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 125: The Inner Light VHS"

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[2, 2]","For someone who digested almost every episode of this show over it's run I guess I slept on this for awhile.But when I revisted it after the series ended and now it is one of my top five favorite stand alone episodes and I know it is to alot of other people.I think one reason is you don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy it.Little of it takes place in the Star Trek universe.But the story touches the viewer in some very unexpected ways with alot of emotional twists and turns.What is it about?The Enterprise encounters this ancient probe in space and it zapps Captain Picard.He awakens to find himself in another world in someone elses life-a man named Kamen living with his wife on the planet Kataan.At first he still doesn't believe his surroundings but soon that changes.As years pass he learns his world is suffering a drought and he and his best friend Batai are working to change that in some way.Sadly his friend passes on before the birth of his second child,a boy who is named after him.As years pass the drought becomes worse until ""Kamen"" finds himself an old man with grandchildren whom,sadly,he knows will have their lives cut abruptly short by the conditions of his planet.The last thing that occurs is when Kataan launches their first roboticspace probe and guess what?It is the same probe that zapped Picard.Turns out that Kataan's sun went nova,the cause of the draught and the entire life he experienced only occured within a few minutes.But now he will doubtless ever forget anyone on Kataan again.This story is full of emmotional release,a wondefully written story and very likable characters.By the end you find yourself sad the the relateable people of Kataan no longer exist in Picards world.The solitary and,I belive lonely starship captain finds himself with a loving family of his own and even a kindly supportive friend in Batai.By the way Patrick Stewarts son Daniel portrays Kamen's grown son of the same name (Batai that is).And since he was granted the gift to remember what happened to him on Kataan I always believed this was the rallying cry to Jean-Luc Picard to become less of a solitary inividual.Just amazing writing,acting and storytelling all around.And it is this type of dyamic by which I tend to measure all other Trek stories by,for better or worse.",5,I Love This Story,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,2299,"['someone', 'who', 'digested', 'almost', 'episode', 'show', 'run', 'guess', 'slept', 'awhile.But', 'when', 'revisted', 'series', 'ended', 'now', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'favorite', 'stand', 'alone', 'know', 'alot', 'other', 'people.I', 'think', 'one', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'it.Little', 'place', 'Star', 'Trek', 'story', 'viewer', 'very', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'alot', 'emotional', 'twists', 'Enterprise', 'ancient', 'probe', 'space', 'Captain', 'Picard.He', 'find', 'world', 'someone', 'life-a', 'man', 'named', 'Kamen', 'living', 'wife', 'planet', 'Kataan.At', 'first', 'still', ""n't"", 'believe', 'surroundings', 'soon', 'changes.As', 'years', 'pass', 'world', 'suffering', 'drought', 'best', 'friend', 'Batai', 'are', 'working', 'change', 'way.Sadly', 'friend', 'birth', 'second', 'child', 'boy', 'who', 'named', 'him.As', 'years', 'pass', 'drought', 'worse', 'Kamen', 'old', 'man', 'grandchildren', 'whom', 'sadly', 'will', 'have', 'lives', 'cut', 'abruptly', 'short', 'conditions', 'planet.The', 'last', 'thing', 'when', 'Kataan', 'first', 'roboticspace', 'probe', 'guess', 'what', 'same', 'probe', 'zapped', 'Picard.Turns', 'out', 'Kataan', 'sun', 'went', 'nova', 'cause', 'draught', 'entire', 'life', 'experienced', 'only', 'occured', 'few', 'minutes.But', 'now', 'will', 'doubtless', 'ever', 'forget', 'anyone', 'Kataan', 'again.This', 'story', 'full', 'emmotional', 'release', 'wondefully', 'written', 'story', 'very', 'likable', 'characters.By', 'end', 'find', 'relateable', 'people', 'Kataan', 'no', 'longer', 'exist', 'Picards', 'world.The', 'solitary', 'belive', 'lonely', 'starship', 'captain', 'loving', 'family', 'own', 'even', 'kindly', 'supportive', 'friend', 'Batai.By', 'way', 'Patrick', 'Stewarts', 'son', 'Daniel', 'Kamen', 'grown', 'son', 'same', 'name', 'Batai', '.And', 'was', 'granted', 'gift', 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'Kataan', 'always', 'believed', 'was', 'rallying', 'cry', 'Jean-Luc', 'Picard', 'become', 'less', 'solitary', 'inividual.Just', 'amazing', 'writing', 'acting', 'storytelling', 'around.And', 'type', 'dyamic', 'tend', 'measure', 'other', 'Trek', 'stories', 'better', 'worse']","Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 125: The Inner Light VHS"
429839,A13DRH017BAN4I,6304614071,Mark Wilsonwood,"[2, 2]","I agree with other 5-star reviewers. This is not only the best episode of this long-running series, but one of the best hours of television, period.The story first struck me in this way (and by the way, I think you need to be of a certain age to think of it this way -- teenagers can skip over this thought): What if I were to suddenly awaken and find that I was back in, say, 1976 -- when I was 20? And realized that the last 30 or so years had been a dream, that my wife and children and friends, the things I had done and places I had been, were all gone -- and I had to start all over again, with an entirely different future ahead of me? The psychological impact would, of course, be staggering. Thinking in these terms, you can feel what Picard felt when he was returned to his former life.But there's another element I didn't think about until later: The issue of the Kataanians (or whatever they're called) doing something like this to an innocent bystander. They violated Picard's mind to a horrific extent; their desire to be remembered motivated them to carry out a heinous crime against Picard. There's more food for thought in this episode than in probably the rest of the series combined.By the way, my favorite scene was this: Kamin (Picard), after several ""years"" have passed in his new life, finally and grudgingly begins to accept the fact that he never was Jean Luc Picard, and there never was an Enterprise or a place called Earth, etc. And then he picks up his flute and plays...
