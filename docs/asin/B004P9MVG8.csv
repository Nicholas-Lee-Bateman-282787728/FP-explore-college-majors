The costumes and settings of this movie are wonderful and the plot and acting are also wonderful.  This movie is dark to the extreme, yet you find yourself still applauding some of the characters as they struggle to survive and even better themselves.  The plight of women of the day is really shown...where there are very few choices, especially should your husband die and you are left with no income.Spoilers below:This is the story of Sugar (no other name) who is a prostitute in old London.  She was born to the life and knows little else, save that she also fancies herself a writer and wants to get away from what she is doing to survive.  To that end, she hooks up with a gentleman who has low self-esteem, also sees himself as a would-be writer, and an overbearing father who despairs of his son taking up his business (beauty products, soaps, lotions etc).  Sugar is said to give every man what he wants...and she does.  Among other things, she inspires William Rackham to be more self-assured and take more control of his life and business, enough so that he makes money to be able to keep her in better surroundings.  However, she soon discovers that all is not well in his home life, as his wife is in fragile mental health and thinks she will soon be called home to some &#34;convent&#34; in Heaven, even as she is tormented by the doctor who is supposed to be helping her.  Sugar slowly becomes more and more embroiled in the life of her sugar-daddy and his messed-up family, as well as in her own machinations.The stars of this movie are really the two women, the prositute and the wife, the crimson petal and the white, and their own struggles to take back their lives and become who they really want to be...despite how society and circumstances try to make them be less than who they are.  This movie doesn't pull any punches as it shows the seamier side of life in London at that time and how even those who are wealthy can be trapped by expectations and their own fears and lack of education.  This movie shows madness and loss and desperation and yet it also contains a message of love and hope.This is definitely not a movie for kids or teens or the faint-of-heart.  It has male and female nudity and some very rough, even brutal scenes.But if you are interested in the plight of women in this time period, you might like this movie.  Even though it is very hard at times to watch and the feel of the movie can stick with you for a long while afterward.

1423508,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B004P9MVG8,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[1, 2]","Compulsory & addictive, it mimes froth of Victorian London Sts. Cinematography, costumes & sets force viewers deeper into its dark psychological story. The plot and writing are less than stellar. Lead characters portrayals leave one mesmerized by the despicable dearth and poverty of a Dickensian era. Catherine Cookson's poor and low-class tales come to mine too. Don't expect glamor and Victorian gaiety, but every form of crime and dereliction known of the time, 1874. No sympathy, it's lost in strong crass depictions that leave little to imagine. Mad, cunning women are played so well the viewer begins to hate, not adore these characters. Yet it's a mini-series you'll love hating.The camera's eye, focused on the disgust of the dirty streets and rooms, is filmed so cunningly it resembles Impressionism art done with dark color. Not a love story, but debauchery glistening from mud, vomit, blood and ale. Stunning visuals obligate viewing. Romola Garai (Emma; Amazing Grace) turns sharply from roles like ""Emma."" As Sugar, she's sweet/sour in her portrayal both with and without clothing as she passes from prostitute, to mistress, to governess. Her Mom and Madam (Gillian Anderson- Bleak House) is so convincing she seems to have literally taken a turn into the underworld. Mrs. Fox (Shirley Henderson- Wish Me Luck: Series 3) seems unable to decide which side of the orgies she desires. William (Chris O'Dowd) will disgust men and women, with and without garments. Plenty more adding to a coarse, disturbing image of poverty and orgy coming to life. Adults only, strongly recommended.SUBTITLES for all 4 episodes (an hour each) and bonus material.1Step immediately into a violent, crass world of brothels, drink, crime, and Sugar. Introductions of William, a want-to-be writer who mirrors Sugar's own novel attempt. His mad wife pens diaries of illness and abuse. Wm's bro writes sermons. Sugar decides Wm is a rung up the ladder of respect.2Wm gets Sugar an apt. She becomes `guardian angel' to another woman, to her gainful advantage. A mistress becomes obsessed. Mrs Fox and Wm's bro have their own bodily fantasies.3Sugar becomes a family tutor and more of a wife's madness is exposed via diaries, driving her closer to an asylum. Sugar interferes with unexpected results.4Sugar's lap of luxury begins to crumble. Loathing works its way into the lust. The climax of lives gets dirty and dark.From the book by Michel Faber. BBC drama, not for the faint of heart. The title comes from a line of Tennyson's 1847 poetry, quoted in the series.If you can't handle earthy, ghastly, sexual crudeness, give it a pass.

1423510,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B004P9MVG8,Jon Wynne,"[1, 2]","In the recent documentary series &#8220;The Story of the Costume Drama,&#8221; mention is made of the fairly recent trend in costume dramas on television to graphically depict sexual behaviour, as well as squalor and decadence. While some interviewed champion such representation as the brave choice, others wonder if enough isn&#8217;t enough with all the self-indulgence.The first few minutes of THE CRIMSON & THE WHITE offer an opportunity for those undecided on the matter to make an informed decision. The audience is subjected to graphic sex, every bodily function you can imagine and a general &#8220;rub your face in it&#8221; approach trotted out under the banner of realism. It alienates anyone with an imagination, as the &#8220;wallowing in filth&#8221; mentality overshadows the message of an otherwise powerful and potentially beautiful story of redemption. I really don&#8217;t need to see Sugar pulling up her skirts and filling the chamberpot to understand the poverty and indignities she suffers. I am bright enough for that, in case anyone is interested for future reference. I suppose I should consider myself lucky they trust my judgement enough not to have CGId her digestive tract to show the process that led to her requirement for the chamber pot.Based on the 800+ page novel by Michel Faber and adapted into a four-hour miniseries, the epic story that unfolds is one of great relevance to society: the refusal of a victim to allow her life circumstances to prevent her from loving others and thus perpetuate the cycle of abuse. This is the redeeming feature of THE CRIMSON PETAL & THE WHITE. After all, how many times do afternoon talk shows feature people who explain their aberrant behaviour and negative life choices by crying they were subjected to similar abuse while growing up? This is not uncommon. Accountability for one&#8217;s life choices is a challenging and timeless theme. Therefore, by presenting a drama that says, in essence, &#8220;there is a better choice to be made,&#8221; the filmmakers have given us a gift, even if they&#8217;ve dropped it in the mud a few times before handing it over.The story&#8217;s central character is a much-abused prostitute named Sugar who rises above her life circumstances through a unique combination of professional skill, natural intelligence, and a passion for language and literature. Sugar is so well-educated that her knowledge of literature (Shakespeare and Tennyson, for example&#8211;it is a line from a Tennyson poem that provides the title of the program) almost strains credibility. She is also possessed of a keen business sense which makes her even more valuable to the man who ultimately offers her a way out from a dead-end existence, sugar-coated though it might temporarily be by her mysterious reputation for never disappointing her clients (meaning she has achieved great status in a time-sensitive profession).Some outstanding performances propel this story of lust, revenge, redemption, madness, obsession and poetic justice. Romola Garai is excellent in the role of Sugar. She is matched by an effective performance by Chris O&#8217;Dowd as her alternately whining, endearing and annoying lover. The best performance for this reviewer is given by Amanda Hale as the mentally unstable wife of O&#8217;Dowd&#8217;s character. She is magnetic and utterly convincing in her sensitive and heart-rending portrayal. And Gillian Anderson&#8217;s portrayal of Sugar&#8217;s madame is creepy enough to be an alien on &#8220;The X-Files&#8221; it is so remarkable.Add to this mix production values that leave no detail left out, and one is easily transported into 1870s London, for better or for worse.So much talent came together to produce THE CRIMSON PETAL & THE WHITE it is actually disheartening to think how it was misdirected into showing human depravity rather than striving for beauty. This is, after all, a story which attempts social relevance.Any consideration of this program has to include the controversial elements as they are so prominently placed they cannot be ignored, rather like a dare&#8211;&#8221;there, what do you think of THAT?&#8221;Therefore how much one enjoys THE CRIMSON PETAL & THE WHITE will depend a great deal on where one sits on the issue raised at the start of this review. Some of the sexual situations are depicted in a way that is borderline pornographic. Many of the encounters continue the recent British television trend to show front to back sex for some reason, (perhaps the easiest way to show both actors in close-up at the same time?) And really, do we need to see people urinating and vomiting and the over-all lack of hygiene shown in loving detail?One other observation, speaking of trends in British programming. Does anyone writing music for films today know how to write an actual musical score nowadays? It seems so much of the current &#8220;music&#8221; is nothing but synthesized, generic-sounding, atmospheric soundscape rather an actual series of tunes. There are exceptions, but so often the background score is just a repetitive, pulsing electronic mishmash which is especially out of place in a period pieceIn the end it all comes down to the story. Despite some loose ends that need explaining (what&#8217;s with Sugar&#8217;s dry skin throughout&#8211;is this an ironic metaphor for something in light of the fact that O&#8217;Dowd&#8217;s character is a manufacturer of soaps and perfumes?)&#8211;the central theme of choosing not to perpetuate abusive behaviour makes THE CRIMSON PETAL & THE WHITE worth a look. Just be warned. There is a lot of unpleasantness and unnecessary indulgences that some will consider offensive.In other news from Acorn Media, the superb series &#8220;Foyle&#8217;s War&#8221; is returning with three new episodes to be broadcast as part of the Masterpiece Mystery Season on PBS in summer of  2013.That&#8217;s down the road a bit at the time of this writing, but it&#8217;s something to be greatly anticipated for fans of the series.&#8220;World War II may be over, but Christopher Foyle&#8217;s war against injustice and wrong-doing rages on,&#8221; says &#8220;Masterpiece&#8221; executive producer Rebecca Eaton. &#8220;His very loyal American [and Canadian] fans will be thrilled.&#8221;Starring Michael Kitchen and Honeysuckle Weeks and created by celebrated novelist and screenwriter Anthony Horowitz, the series will see Foyle and loyal friend Sam in a new post War era as their worlds shift into those of MI5.With many stories based on real-life cases, Foyle will focus his attention on the world of espionage as he gathers secret intelligence in support of Britain&#8217;s security, defence and the Government&#8217;s foreign and economic policies.In his new role as a Senior Intelligence Officer, Foyle discovers that the British establishment is rife with communist sympathisers and traitors. In this delicately-balanced period in history, 1946-47, Foyle will use all his intelligence, guile and intuition to keep the country safe.Meanwhile, Sam is happily married to local MP Adam and finding her feet as a wife with a daunting role in local politics. Reunited with Foyle, she is also offered a surprising new working role&#8230;The three x 120 minute films have been ordered from Eleventh Hour Films, the production company founded by producer Jill Green.

It's a portrait of a woman who was forced into prostitution by her own mother at the age of 13. The character ""Sugar"" decides to live life on her own terms and take what happiness she can get. She takes up with a ""john"" who is obsessed with her, and I found his character to be quite vile. All of the actors here do a stellar job with their parts, and the seedy streets of London in the 1800s is portrayed very effectively. I don't want to say too much so as not to spoil the plot for you, but the character of Agnes brought to mind the short story ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. The way poor Agnes was treated by the men in her world bothered me even more than the prostitution theme!

1423514,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004P9MVG8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[18, 19]","The four part British production ""The Crimson Petal and The White"" showcases a world with little hope and much depravity. And yet, it revels in this exquisite misery! It is so bleak and so dark, in fact, it is sure to turn off certain viewers. But its willingness to push into this unpleasantness (and beyond) is just what makes this miniseries so compelling and so very different. It is a masterful presentation, to be sure, recreating a London of the 1870's with rich period detail in both costuming and sets. But this is no staid and refined period piece. It is explicit and graphic in depicting the underbelly of the city. Set partly in the streets and the brothels of London and partly in the realm of the aristocracy, ""The Crimson Petal and The White"" tells the story of one prostitute's efforts to bridge this gap by any means necessary. And what she finds as she moves toward better conditions are every bit as alarming and disturbing as what is shown on the mean streets! Really, there is no respite in this world! But that's exactly why I liked this brutal and uncompromising program, it never goes soft or promises anyone happiness.Romola Garai play Sugar, a world weary working girl, who really knows how to manipulate a mark. She harbors violent fantasies and dreams of a different life. Setting herself apart as a premium girl, she pursues an avenue of escape with single minded obsession. One day, she meets a rather timid john (Chris O'Dowd) who seems smitten with her and is genuinely easy to bend to her will. When she recognizes that he is a man of great wealth, she maneuvers to become his mistress. She insinuates herself into the life of his mentally damaged wife and eventually gets close to his troubled daughter. But what soon becomes apparent is that this new world is fraught with a different kind of danger. And she morphs from the power holder in her relationship with O'Dowd to someone completely at his beck and call. The household is a rather unsettling place and she comes to understand the wife's madness and the daughter's withdrawal. Can she find redemption? Is she to become a reluctant hero? Or will her twisted game of cat and mouse continue indefinitely with her increasingly dismissive patron?The cast of ""The Crimson Petal and The White"" really display themselves well in change of pace roles. Garai (most recently of The Hours) has never seemed so hardened or manipulative. At first, I was somewhat put off by her aloofness, but it is this matter-of-fact vacantness that serves as the hard exterior necessary for survival. O'Dowd, now getting a lot of notice for comedic performances (Bridesmaids), is mesmerizing as someone you'd rather not know. I really liked this darker persona. They are really the heart of this story, but a number of familiar faces are in the supporting cast including Gillian Anderson as a gruesome madam, Shirley Henderson as a reformer, and Richard Grant as a doctor. Everyone is quite good, but the O'Dowd and Garai dynamic is always the miniserie's strongest aspect. The show was nominated for a slew of 2012 BAFTAs including Best Actress for Garai and Best Miniseries. ""The Crimson Petal and The White"" is never particularly enjoyable, per se, but it's a bold and provocative experience for adult audiences who don't mind a little wallow on the dark side.

1423515,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B004P9MVG8,lily t.,"[0, 0]","When fat and feckless William Rackham encounters the mysterious prostitute Sugar in the bowls of the Victorian underworld, this strangely addictive tale of false power lost and true power-the power of love -gained, begins.William, the heir to a perfume fortune,  disregards the family business, while fancying himself a literary man despite his utter lack of talent. In the meanwhile, his wife, the angel of the house [ as upper middle class Victorians loved to think of those sexless paragons of virtue, their wives] is falling deeper and deeper into hysteria [ this time the malady actually rests with her attitude toward her womb]. Their child, a daughter, is ignored by both parents and relegated to a hideously barren nursery.Enter Sugar, a young woman forced into prostitution at the age of thirteen by her own savagely cruel mother [ an unrecognizable and brilliant Gillian Anderson] who has not only managed to uplift herself by reading but is also writing a novel, an erotic tale of violence and revenge, which serves to keep her sane as she plies her trade.The story unfolds as Sugar slowly infiltrates William's life, helping him gain power over both his business and domestic situation. But when she sees how deeply narcissistic and inept he is as far his family is concerned, she intervenes. How she loses her power [over William ] and regains it by finding love and compassion, within herself and for his wife and child, is at the heart of the story--and if you are at all sensitive, it will make you seethe with anger at the injustices perpetrated by the upper classes with all their hypocrisies, misogyny and convictions about the patriarchy and early stage capitalism.The filth, poverty and disease is artistically presented, though skin maladies seem to afflict most of the denizens of the poor quarters-including Sugar herself who suffers from ichthyosis [ either genetic or could be brought on by stress, filth, lack of sunlight, poor nutrition, faulty immune system ]- and the fallen horse and homeless dogs are as fat as could be--so don't worry, there is nothing here that will give you nightmares. Though the true history of the era, when women worked long hours for pitiful wages in factories, or as domestics and seamstresses; when there was one prostitute for every 12 men in London and women were treated as chattel, when reformers and their houses were as unsavory as life on the street, when attitudes toward sex and women were cruelly unjust, when upper class men and sons of wealthy houses forced themselves on domestics and then placed the blame on the women themselves, should give everyone pause -and some understanding why Sugar initially behaved as she did.I blew through all four parts in one night and then ordered the book.

If you only watch one Movie or Mini Series this year this is the one. The book can be off-putting at first if you're adverse to foul language and sexual references but you just have to remember at the very beginning that it's necessary to this story. It seems to me to be more of a tale of the plight of Women in that period of history (1800's) and it's incredibly moving. The story itself moves at a good pace and I was so engrossed I couldn't stop watching. It seems very realistic of the time period and brings to light some of the atrocities women had to deal with in that Century. It's well known that Prostitutes were very prevalent then and that men could easily put their wives in an insane asylum if they chose to whether the wife was insane or not. However this movie goes deeper, it shows other issues that one might never imagine if they never saw this film. I don't want to spoil it for anyone by telling too much of the plot but I think all women should see this series if only to gain a better understanding of history. It's the BBC so you can be assured it's not going to be too raunchy and all of the scenes that might offend someone are relevant to the story and tastefully done. I watched it with my 72 year old Mother. Sets and costumes are perfect and realistic. Excellent film and very well done.",5,"If only I could write like this...

I won't spoil the end for anyone, but it left me wishing for an epilogue of sorts, the only slightly unsatisfying part, but I suppose it stayed quite true to the book.
