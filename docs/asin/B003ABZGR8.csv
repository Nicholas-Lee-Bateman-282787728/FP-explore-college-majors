If, unfortunately you have it in your hands, just enjoy the DVD cover. That's the best it's going to get. This is a perfect example of how good, but misguided God-fearing people, try and hijack popular culture, (i.e. disaster movies), and twist it into their little world. I'm sure it will be a relief to Christians everywhere that their salvation will come by the wisdom of human-sacrificing Mayans. I've got nothing against that and I'm glad this movie saw fit to enlighten me to their point of view. Interesting. Very interesting.Seriously, this movie shows no saving grace. Not even in an unintentionally funny way. There are a few, but sparsely sprinkled goofs:* For the first part of the film, Dale Midkiff's dialog contains the phrase, ""Get out of here!"", every other paragraph of script.* A dizzy, spinning, camera on a monologue between Dale and his separated wife.* Later, a celibate confessional between the above husband and wife.* The young couple who can't seem to find the guy's car and proceed to walk for miles. Somehow the car is ""just over the hill"", in the middle of nowhere, when they need it.* A couple of really bad budget scenes of monologue delivered in an ambulance and airplane. Both look like they were shot on a junior high auditorium stage.* When the heroine's car breaks down I could swear she swears, but they cut in the dialogue, ""Oh, no!""* A hail storm that strikes and just suddenly stops so the heroine can say a last prayer to her friend. Not to mention a very lengthy dying scene that in real life would have lasted a quarter of the time.* The unbelievable easy, or truly sad, willingness of some of the characters to just give and die. Come on people, you need to fight for life. It isn't just handed to you!!!* The credits which include the extremely long list of ""background players"". I'm surprised they didn't give credit to Pastor Joe or Nun Mary.Basically, this was a project thought up to find an interesting, yet unsuccessful in my book, way of inputting God-speak into a poorly conceived film. It's also very embarrassing to see the good Anglos ""saving"" the people of Latin America. What would they do without these wonderful Americans? Thank all graces theirs an Anglo to help the forgotten Mexican, mother to be, deliver her ""bloody show"" onto the Mayan alter. Her sacrifice that, I guess, takes the place of real human sacrifice that the schooled Mayans practiced? Spolier alert: there is a new beginning and it comes from the Mayans, at least according to this movie's interpretation. I maybe wrong, but I really don't think that's what the producers wanted us to believe but that's the message they deliver. I guess that's the punch line to this movie.

1334742,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B003ABZGR8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 8]","As much as I love The Asylum and their steady stream of cheap knock-offs of Hollywood blockbusters, I have to admit that my guys took a big whiff on this one.  Most of The Asylum's films are either hilariously bad or, on occasion, even better than the film being ripped off (Paranormal Entity, for example).  Something went horribly wrong with 2012: Doomsday, though; this movie just isn't any good at all.  It's not all The Asylum's fault, however, as the company made this film in association with a production company called Faith Films.  At first, I couldn't understand all of the criticism about this being Christian propaganda (as if there is anything wrong with trying to spread God's message through the popular medium of film) because, believe you me, The Asylum is not in the business of preaching Christianity - and even if they were, this film proves that they're not any good at it.  It turns out, though, that Faith Films does have a Christian agenda (2012: Doomsday is part of something they call their End Times collection).  I still don't see the problem.  It's not like this film is beating you over the head with calls to repent or anything; the Christian angle they tack on to Mayan prophecy is downright weird - I'll grant you that - but the ""propaganda"" aspects of this film basically consist of some prayer and some discussions about seeing the beautiful side of life and accepting whatever path God has put you on.  I don't know about you, but God and prayer would certainly be two of my priorities if an ""end of days"" was falling all around my head.Getting back to the story, it turns out that the Mayans were spot on with their prediction of the end of the age on December 21, 2012.  Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons, super storms, and all sorts of nasty natural disasters are happening all over the world as the earth begins to stop spinning around its axis.  While most of the people on the planet start to panic and evacuate to safer ground, several individuals find themselves mysteriously drawn to the ancient Mayan pyramid at Chichen Itza.  The first is an archaeologist who is trying to fulfill the Mayan prophecy he has just discovered (which involves an utterly inane and laughable connection between the Mayans and Christianity).  Then there's the missionary in Mexico who believes God has given her an integral role to play in this historic time - and her father, who just wants to find and protect his daughter from the impending global catastrophe.  Representing the atheistic crowd is a paramedic from California compelled to go to Chichen Itza for reasons she can't explain.  And, despite the reference in the movie summary to four strangers coming together, there's actually a fifth person along for the ride, in the form of a very pregnant Mayan woman.The whole story is inane, filled with way too much boring dialogue, but it is the special effects that really make 2012: Doomsday such an embarrassment.  First off, don't expect to ooh and aah at a lot of harrowing shots of Mother Nature throwing the mother of all tantrums.  Every so often, the ground cracks open, but there is almost nothing in the way of explosions, floods, and the like.  You can only do so much with a budget of roughly a quarter of a million dollars, but I still expect better than just shaking the camera to represent an earthquake or adding digital snow and hail to simulate the cold temperatures suddenly inundating even the jungles of Mexico.  The special effects in this film really are nothing short of laughable.So there you have it - 2012: Doomsday is one of the most boring and unenjoyable doomsday films ever produced.  I think the whole ""Christian propaganda"" criticism is overblown, but that still leaves plenty of other problems dragging this film down into the ranks of the nearly unwatchable.  It's just too bad the Mayans didn't include a warning about this film somewhere in their doomsday prophecies - or maybe they did, and those stinking conquistadors destroyed it.",2,A major disappointment on multiple levels,1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,4012,"['As', 'much', 'love', 'Asylum', 'steady', 'stream', 'cheap', 'knock-offs', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'have', 'admit', 'guys', 'took', 'big', 'whiff', 'one', 'Most', 'Asylum', 'films', 'are', 'hilariously', 'bad', 'occasion', 'even', 'better', 'film', 'being', 'ripped', 'off', 'Paranormal', 'Entity', 'example', 'Something', 'went', 'horribly', 'wrong', '2012', 'Doomsday', 'though', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'good', 'not', 'Asylum', 'fault', 'however', 'company', 'made', 'film', 'association', 'production', 'company', 'called', 'Faith', 'Films', 'first', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'criticism', 'being', 'Christian', 'propaganda', 'anything', 'wrong', 'trying', 'spread', 'God', 'message', 'popular', 'medium', 'film', 'believe', 'Asylum', 'not', 'business', 'preaching', 'Christianity', 'even', 'were', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'good', 'out', 'though', 'Faith', 'Films', 'have', 'Christian', 'agenda', '2012', 'Doomsday', 'part', 'something', 'call', 'End', 'Times', 'collection', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'not', 'film', 'beating', 'head', 'calls', 'repent', 'anything', 'Christian', 'angle', 'tack', 'Mayan', 'prophecy', 'downright', 'weird', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'propaganda', 'aspects', 'film', 'basically', 'consist', 'prayer', 'discussions', 'seeing', 'beautiful', 'side', 'life', 'accepting', 'path', 'God', 'put', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'God', 'prayer', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'two', 'priorities', 'end', 'days', 'was', 'falling', 'all', 'head.Getting', 'back', 'story', 'out', 'Mayans', 'were', 'spot', 'prediction', 'end', 'age', 'December', '21', '2012', 'Earthquakes', 'volcanic', 'eruptions', 'typhoons', 'super', 'storms', 'sorts', 'nasty', 'natural', 'disasters', 'are', 'happening', 'world', 'earth', 'stop', 'spinning', 'axis', 'most', 'people', 'planet', 'start', 'panic', 'evacuate', 'safer', 'ground', 'several', 'individuals', 'find', 'mysteriously', 'ancient', 'Mayan', 'pyramid', 'Chichen', 'Itza', 'first', 'archaeologist', 'who', 'trying', 'fulfill', 'Mayan', 'prophecy', 'just', 'discovered', 'utterly', 'inane', 'laughable', 'connection', 'Mayans', 'Christianity', 'Then', 'missionary', 'Mexico', 'who', 'God', 'given', 'integral', 'role', 'play', 'historic', 'time', 'father', 'who', 'just', 'find', 'protect', 'daughter', 'impending', 'global', 'catastrophe', 'Representing', 'atheistic', 'crowd', 'paramedic', 'California', 'compelled', 'go', 'Chichen', 'Itza', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'reference', 'movie', 'summary', 'four', 'strangers', 'coming', 'together', 'actually', 'fifth', 'person', 'ride', 'form', 'very', 'pregnant', 'Mayan', 'woman.The', 'whole', 'story', 'inane', 'filled', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'boring', 'dialogue', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'make', '2012', 'Doomsday', 'embarrassment', 'First', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'ooh', 'aah', 'lot', 'harrowing', 'shots', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'throwing', 'mother', 'tantrums', 'Every', 'so', 'often', 'ground', 'open', 'almost', 'nothing', 'way', 'explosions', 'floods', 'like', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'budget', 'roughly', 'quarter', 'million', 'dollars', 'still', 'expect', 'better', 'just', 'shaking', 'camera', 'represent', 'earthquake', 'adding', 'digital', 'snow', 'hail', 'simulate', 'cold', 'temperatures', 'suddenly', 'inundating', 'even', 'jungles', 'Mexico', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'really', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'laughable.So', 'have', '2012', 'Doomsday', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'unenjoyable', 'doomsday', 'films', 'ever', 'produced', 'think', 'whole', 'Christian', 'propaganda', 'criticism', 'overblown', 'still', 'plenty', 'other', 'problems', 'dragging', 'film', 'down', 'ranks', 'nearly', 'unwatchable', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'Mayans', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'warning', 'film', 'somewhere', 'doomsday', 'maybe', 'did', 'stinking', 'conquistadors', 'destroyed']",N/A
1334743,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B003ABZGR8,David Bower,"[1, 2]","It would appear that I am a maverick when it comes to this film; I didn't think it was terrible, just confused. I was able to watch it all the way through without falling out of my chair with laughter or falling asleep and I thought there were some moments when the acting came across very convincingly.I do not buy into the ideas circulating about 2012 being the end of the world; as an Evangelical Christian I am completely convinced the Bible's account of the end of the world is entirely correct and it isn't in 2012. There are a lot of things the Bible says will happen before the world comes to an end; there will be a major renovation but that happens several years after the next thing on the list which just happens to be the Rapture.I was interested in noting that some Christian soteriology and eschatology in bits and pieces was included in the film, but the final picture of the end times as described was completely off base from the Bible's teachings on the subject. I'll not go into what I think the Bible teaches about the end times but it is drastically different from what was presented in the movie.I too thought the effort to tie Christian eschatology in with the Mayan calendar was feeble and ill-advised. Having said all that, I did find the movie tolerable and thought it even had some exciting moments. There is hardly a movie out there that is totally free of bloopers and if this movie had so many that it took extra time to watch it then that scores much better in the laugh department than some so-called comedies; maybe it'll establish itself as a cult comedy.I don't regret having watched the movie but I doubt that I'll watch it again anytime soon.",3,Confused But Not All That Bad,1277251200,"06 23, 2010",2010,1680,"['would', 'appear', 'am', 'maverick', 'when', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'terrible', 'just', 'confused', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'way', 'falling', 'chair', 'laughter', 'falling', 'asleep', 'thought', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'acting', 'came', 'very', 'convincingly.I', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'ideas', 'circulating', '2012', 'being', 'end', 'world', 'Evangelical', 'Christian', 'am', 'completely', 'convinced', 'Bible', 'account', 'end', 'world', 'entirely', 'correct', ""n't"", '2012', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'Bible', 'will', 'happen', 'world', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'major', 'renovation', 'several', 'years', 'next', 'thing', 'list', 'just', 'be', 'Rapture.I', 'was', 'interested', 'noting', 'Christian', 'soteriology', 'eschatology', 'bits', 'pieces', 'was', 'included', 'film', 'final', 'picture', 'end', 'times', 'described', 'was', 'completely', 'base', 'Bible', 'teachings', 'subject', ""'ll"", 'not', 'go', 'what', 'think', 'Bible', 'teaches', 'end', 'times', 'drastically', 'different', 'what', 'was', 'presented', 'movie.I', 'too', 'thought', 'effort', 'tie', 'Christian', 'eschatology', 'Mayan', 'calendar', 'was', 'feeble', 'ill-advised', 'Having', 'said', 'did', 'find', 'movie', 'tolerable', 'thought', 'even', 'had', 'exciting', 'moments', 'hardly', 'movie', 'there', 'totally', 'free', 'bloopers', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'took', 'extra', 'time', 'watch', 'then', 'much', 'better', 'laugh', 'department', 'so-called', 'comedies', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'establish', 'cult', 'comedy.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'having', 'watched', 'movie', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon']",N/A

Not to mention, logically (and common sensically) speaking, there's no real reason for the other people to be there (except maybe one of them to help her get there), except as an audience. Special effects-wise, the cover looks like something out of a 40's sci-fi flick, yet that would sound like it's giving credit, since all the special effects are only worth a painful roll of the eyes. The acting is about the best special effects, and even then is rather horrid, predictable, exceptionally typical, and goes perfect with the terribly predictable lines spoken. Literally everything said becomes another reason why I'm glad this isn't in my collection, especially when there's nothing applicable with what every cardboard-cutout Christian says to every cardboard-cutout nonChristian.What's very sad is that not even Cliff DeYoung (who became the top reason I love the Love Comes Softly series, and I really can't stand prairie-based movies) could help the movie.They could've used the budget for the whole movie as a starter to a better movie project (they're currently working on the movie version of Day of War by Cliff Graham, this could've been helpful!) or a charity organization, just something besides making a terrible excuse for a Christian indie flick like this.Yeah, I'd definitely stick with Blue Like Jazz, Soul Surfer, and To Save A Life.

Little suspense or surprises exist; the characters have no free will and are not believable or compelling.  The dialogue is preachy and impossibly frustrating to hear.  And the ending of the movie contradicts everything that happened before, which undermines the literal interpretation of the book of Revelations has been hammered home for 90 minutes.  Two stars maximum, possibly only one star because nothing happens.""The Apocalypse"" is far more dramatic and unpredictable.  Pseudo-scientific explanations are proposed, and characters behave in a believable way.  ""The Apocalypse"" is a relationship movie between the characters and between the characters and the Christian god.  The acting and special affects are a grade above that seen in ""Doomsday"".  Three stars, possibly four stars for acting.The version of the DVD that I purchased contains the digital version of both movies, which is a great bonus.If you buy this double-feature DVD, buy it for ""The Apocalypse"".",3,"One Good Movie, One Bad Movie",1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,1266,"['2012', 'Doomsday', 'Apocalypse', 'are', 'double-sided', 'DVD', 'portray', 'two', 'different', 'interpretations', 'Christianity', 'one', 'Calvinistic', 'one', 'more', 'free-will', '2012', 'Doomsday', 'predestined', 'predetermined', 'movie', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'Mayan', 'pyramid', 'Little', 'suspense', 'surprises', 'exist', 'characters', 'have', 'free', 'will', 'are', 'not', 'believable', 'compelling', 'dialogue', 'preachy', 'impossibly', 'frustrating', 'hear', 'ending', 'movie', 'everything', 'happened', 'literal', 'interpretation', 'book', 'Revelations', 'been', 'hammered', 'home', '90', 'minutes', 'Two', 'stars', 'maximum', 'possibly', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'nothing', 'happens', 'Apocalypse', 'far', 'more', 'dramatic', 'unpredictable', 'Pseudo-scientific', 'explanations', 'are', 'proposed', 'characters', 'behave', 'believable', 'way', 'Apocalypse', 'relationship', 'movie', 'characters', 'characters', 'Christian', 'god', 'acting', 'special', 'affects', 'are', 'grade', 'seen', 'Doomsday', 'Three', 'stars', 'possibly', 'four', 'stars', 'acting.The', 'version', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'digital', 'version', 'movies', 'great', 'bonus.If', 'buy', 'double-feature', 'DVD', 'buy', 'Apocalypse']",N/A

This movie, for plot, acting or special effects in no way comes even close to matching 2012, the major movie release of last year.  This particular movie is made on a very small budget; if you have watched any of the disaster movies shown on the SYFY channel, you have a good idea what you are in for here. There are computer generated special effects, some pretty good, some pretty obvious, such as the subzero blizzard in the tropics that doesn't seem to bother the plants at all or make the actors appear to be particularly cold in their tropical clothing. On the plus side, the movie was largely filmed in Belize using at least some footage of a Mayan temple, which helps a bit there.  The basic plot of the movie has various people attempting to get to a Mexican Mayan pyramid by Dec. 21st in order to fulfill a Mayan/Christian prophecy.  There are some major holes in the logic of the film, such as why the Mayans would incorporate Christianity into the design of a pyramid long before the arrival of the Spanish,  but NOT incorporate it into their lives and culture. The movie is produced by a company called Faith Films which explains why,  several times in it's approximately 80 minute running time,  it seems to grind to a halt to deliver a mini-sermon. Most of the action takes place in out of the way locations and involves a small number of people; considering the world is threatened with total destruction,  I am not sure where the rest of us are and why we don't seem to care; are we all hiding in our basements?  I bought this double feature disc on impulse in Walmart for under $10.
