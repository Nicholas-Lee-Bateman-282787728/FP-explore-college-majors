Includes 4min production featurette with comments from Lawrence Kason (the writer, director, and producer) and some of the players. At the beginning of the DVD you can skip or FF 'other-movie' trailers to get to the main menu. Access this movie's theatrical trailer  and the other-movie trailers from the menu. No cast or crew biographies.THE MOVIE: This wonderfully pleasant film has a steady pace and upbeat attitude throughout. It is a good film for both entertainment and as a catalyst for personal growth introspection. Why is it so difficult for us to change ourselves? Sometimes all we need for change is a little help and trust from someone, but then how easy is it to be so engrossed in our problem and forget about the person who is helping us. Then again, our problems sometimes look so simple from a different perspective.This film has excellent examples of patience, kindness, firmness, and healthy attitudes. Even with a problem one can have a healthy attitude. No matter how bad a problem, everything's okay. If only we could behave towards others like the psychologist Mumford. Maybe what we need is to spend time in a monastery.",4,Wonderfully pleasant film.,1033776000,"10 5, 2002",2002,1279,"['DVD', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'standard', 'menu', '30', 'chapters', 'well', 'placed', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Close', 'Captioned', 'follow', 'audio', 'verbatim', '4min', 'production', 'featurette', 'comments', 'Lawrence', 'Kason', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'players', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'can', 'skip', 'FF', ""'other-movie"", 'trailers', 'get', 'main', 'menu', 'Access', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'other-movie', 'trailers', 'menu', 'cast', 'crew', 'biographies.THE', 'MOVIE', 'wonderfully', 'pleasant', 'film', 'steady', 'pace', 'upbeat', 'attitude', 'good', 'film', 'entertainment', 'catalyst', 'personal', 'growth', 'introspection', 'Why', 'so', 'difficult', 'change', 'Sometimes', 'need', 'change', 'little', 'help', 'trust', 'someone', 'then', 'how', 'easy', 'be', 'so', 'engrossed', 'problem', 'forget', 'person', 'who', 'helping', 'Then', 'again', 'problems', 'sometimes', 'look', 'so', 'simple', 'different', 'perspective.This', 'film', 'excellent', 'examples', 'patience', 'kindness', 'firmness', 'healthy', 'attitudes', 'Even', 'problem', 'one', 'can', 'have', 'healthy', 'attitude', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'problem', 'everything', 'okay', 'only', 'could', 'behave', 'towards', 'others', 'psychologist', 'Mumford', 'Maybe', 'what', 'need', 'spend', 'time', 'monastery']",Mumford VHS
476907,A1IQVBGOYVEFBI,6305763313,Allan Brain,"[5, 5]","Lawrence Kasdan has done it again.  In &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;, another terrific movie, Kasdan's characters made connections that changed the course of their lives, just by being alert to the opportunities that inhere  in everyday circumstances that most people let pass.  Like the Kevin Kline  character in that film, here Dr. Mumford, played wonderfully by Dean,  breaks the rules of social convention and makes a difference in the lives  of others.  That is one of the things that makes movies like this  uplifting.It's basically the same point made in the classic film we all  know from the Christmas season, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;--you can  make a difference. But here the bonus is that this film is partially a  hilarious send-up of the &quot;mental health&quot; business, as usually  practiced by those in the field of psychiatry/psychology/therapy.  Anyone  who is skeptical of the  conventional &quot;methodologies&quot; of  therapists will love this film.There are several great scenes: imagine  a therapist who takes his patient for a long walk, plays catch with  another, all the while talking as another human being, and listening,  really getting to know what the &quot;patient's&quot; concerns are.The  humor is understated, but occasionally laugh out loud. The characters are  compelling.  The observations, especially as we see what Mumford, the  protagonist, has escaped from himself in his own life, are wise and moving.  It's a movie to watch with your best friend, or maybe someone you want to  be your best friend.So why not five stars?  I didn't like the music  used.  But undoubtedly this is a great movie.

476910,AK6UVFSU07NXH,6305763313,Anthony Hinde,"[15, 17]","Only in America could a small town be host to three psychologist/psychiatrist practitioners. As an Australian, where it is still shameful to need any kind of mental doctoring, I have long been sceptical of the whole head shrinking profession. Not ""L. Ron Hubbard sceptical"" but still wary. So it was with some surprise that ""Mumford"" opened my eyes. Its portrayal of the town's new counsellor makes me want to get therapy. Young Dr Mumford, not to be confused with the town of the same name, is quiet, attentive, honest and tough with his clients. He's more like an old friend than one of Freud's illegitimate offspring.Strangely, Dr Mumford, (Loren Dean), while the center of the story, is the least unusual character in the film. Typical of Lawrence Kasdan's scripts, the main cast is large and yet well fleshed out. In a way, because we meet most of them within the setting of a psychologist's office, their problems seem more real. At least there, one is expected to lay problems out for an audience. It seems so much more natural than the traditional emotional breakdown or a verbal outpouring to a stranger in a bar.For the record we get to know a pharmacist with vivid soft-porn fantasies, a wealthy housewife with a shopping compulsion, a tough teenage girl suffering with esteem issues, a fatigued woman forced under the care of her domineering mother and a wealth but friendless inventor who is obsessed with creating a mechanical solution to his loneliness. Even the non-patients are fascinating despite having smaller roles. I particularly like Martin Short's lawyer and Ted Danson's work-a-holic father.Compared to the other therapists in town, Mumford is a breath of fresh air. He won't put up with [anything] from his clients and it is very enjoyable to watch him kick the local Lawyer out of his office during their first session, apparently just for being a self centered jackass. In another departure from tradition, the Doc makes little attempt to hold his clients confessions in confidence; at least not from Skip, the town's young, eccentric billionaire. But to be fair, Mumford doesn't keep his own secrets from Skip either, and as we find out eventually, his secrets are much more interesting than those his patients reluctantly divulge.The pace of the film is relatively slow but Kasdan is such a skilled storyteller that I would have been happy if it had never stopped. However, change is inevitable and in Dr. Mumford's case change takes the shape of a winsome yet beautiful patient named Sofie, who has been plagued by chronic fatigue syndrome for years. This is not one of those cookie cutter romances, dropped into the film to keep the female audience happy.  As flexible as Mumford's profession ethics are, he can't bring himself to express his growing love for his patient, even after she confesses her feeling for him. It is this dilemma that forces Mumford to take a big step in his life.""Mumford"" is a film for voyeurs and for anyone interested in people. You get the feeling that, Despite their flaws, everyone in the film is worth knowing. Perhaps that is the message Kasdan is trying to deliver. Everybody has a story to tell, if only you dig far enough. And who better to do the digging than a psychologist with his own unique story to tell.",4,Watch this film and call me in the morning.,1006300800,"11 21, 2001",2001,3279,"['Only', 'America', 'could', 'small', 'town', 'be', 'host', 'three', 'psychologist/psychiatrist', 'practitioners', 'Australian', 'where', 'still', 'shameful', 'need', 'kind', 'mental', 'doctoring', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'sceptical', 'whole', 'head', 'shrinking', 'profession', 'Not', 'L.', 'Ron', 'Hubbard', 'sceptical', 'still', 'wary', 'was', 'surprise', 'Mumford', 'opened', 'eyes', 'portrayal', 'town', 'new', 'counsellor', 'want', 'get', 'therapy', 'Young', 'Dr', 'Mumford', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'town', 'same', 'name', 'quiet', 'attentive', 'honest', 'tough', 'clients', 'more', 'old', 'friend', 'one', 'Freud', 'illegitimate', 'offspring.Strangely', 'Dr', 'Mumford', 'Loren', 'Dean', 'center', 'story', 'least', 'unusual', 'character', 'film', 'Typical', 'Lawrence', 'Kasdan', 'scripts', 'main', 'cast', 'large', 'yet', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'way', 'meet', 'most', 'setting', 'psychologist', 'office', 'problems', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'least', 'there', 'one', 'expected', 'lay', 'problems', 'out', 'audience', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'natural', 'traditional', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'verbal', 'outpouring', 'stranger', 'bar.For', 'record', 'get', 'know', 'pharmacist', 'vivid', 'soft-porn', 'fantasies', 'wealthy', 'housewife', 'shopping', 'compulsion', 'tough', 'teenage', 'girl', 'suffering', 'esteem', 'issues', 'fatigued', 'woman', 'forced', 'care', 'domineering', 'mother', 'wealth', 'friendless', 'inventor', 'who', 'obsessed', 'creating', 'mechanical', 'solution', 'loneliness', 'Even', 'non-patients', 'are', 'fascinating', 'having', 'smaller', 'roles', 'particularly', 'Martin', 'Short', 'lawyer', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'work-a-holic', 'father.Compared', 'other', 'therapists', 'town', 'Mumford', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'wo', ""n't"", 'put', 'up', '[', 'anything', ']', 'clients', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'kick', 'local', 'Lawyer', 'office', 'first', 'session', 'apparently', 'just', 'being', 'self', 'centered', 'jackass', 'departure', 'tradition', 'Doc', 'little', 'attempt', 'hold', 'clients', 'confessions', 'confidence', 'least', 'not', 'Skip', 'town', 'young', 'eccentric', 'billionaire', 'be', 'fair', 'Mumford', ""n't"", 'keep', 'own', 'secrets', 'Skip', 'find', 'out', 'eventually', 'secrets', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'patients', 'reluctantly', 'divulge.The', 'pace', 'film', 'relatively', 'slow', 'Kasdan', 'such', 'skilled', 'storyteller', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'had', 'never', 'stopped', 'However', 'change', 'inevitable', 'Dr.', 'Mumford', 'case', 'change', 'shape', 'winsome', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'patient', 'named', 'Sofie', 'who', 'been', 'plagued', 'chronic', 'fatigue', 'syndrome', 'years', 'not', 'one', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'romances', 'dropped', 'film', 'keep', 'female', 'audience', 'happy', 'As', 'flexible', 'Mumford', 'profession', 'ethics', 'are', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'express', 'growing', 'love', 'patient', 'even', 'feeling', 'dilemma', 'Mumford', 'take', 'big', 'step', 'life', 'Mumford', 'film', 'voyeurs', 'anyone', 'interested', 'people', 'get', 'feeling', 'flaws', 'everyone', 'film', 'worth', 'knowing', 'Perhaps', 'message', 'Kasdan', 'trying', 'deliver', 'Everybody', 'story', 'tell', 'only', 'dig', 'far', 'enough', 'who', 'better', 'do', 'digging', 'psychologist', 'own', 'unique', 'story', 'tell']",Mumford VHS
476911,AJQ1S39GZBKUG,6305763313,"A. T. A. Oliveira ""A. T. A. Oliveira""","[2, 2]","Lawrence Kasdan is known as a director in whose films characters are the most important thing, so they are very deep and well developed. This `Mumford' makes no exeception to his other movies. There are plenty of people here, and all of them seem to be real people, and make us care about.The main character --Mumford-- is a shrink in a little town where people have not so complicated problems, only simple ones. So his jos resulmes to sit and listen to his patients, nod along and give one or two suggestions. But, we know, the movie must move on; and we also know he has something he prefers to leave behind. Nevertheless, the past knocks his door and he has to face it.However, it seems to me that Dr Mumford is only virtually the main character of this drama. Because he sounds like an excuse to tell many other stories -- his patients' --, which happen to be as interesting as his own past. It is impossible not to get involved with the characters and their problems. Even the audience tries to come up in their mind with solutions to these people's conditions. And, let's face it, it is not hard to diagnose what is affecting them, nor to figure out a way of dealing with.The cast is good. Although Loren Dean, the actor who plays Dr Mumford, looks a bit apathic sometimtes -- but actually I think this is the way the character is--, Hope Davis is wonderful and she steals the show. She plays a woman with a strange syndrome, who is tired most of the time and has lost the interest in life. She is beautiful and looks sunny despite her sadness. Jason Lee is extremelly effective and captivating as a very lonely young man, who makes friends with Doc --as he says.All in all, this is an authentic Lawrence Kasdan's movie --if there happens to be such a thing. It is dramatic -- not so much-- and very funny sometimes.

I don't like it, I don't hate it, and I don't feel any different after having seen it.  I hate being so apathetic, but that's just what this movie does to a viewer.This is the story of a pseudo-psychologist named Mumford (Loren Dean) who lives and practices in a town named Mumford.  He's not the typical shrink.  He'll make you feel bad if he has to, he'll tell you to never come back to his office again, and he'll divulge your inner most secrets to anyone who wants to know them.  But in spite of his unprofessional approaches to therapy, the whole town seems to love him.  We learn half-way through the movie that he's not really a psychologist at all, and everything this town knows about me is completely fraudulent.  He's really a former investigator for the Internal Revenue Service who took a few wrong turns in life and decided to completely relinquish his past and start over in this town.  The movie shows him treating several very colorful and interesting patients with some very serious problems before his true identity is discovered, though I won't reveal the consequences he must face in the end.Loren Dean does an adequate job in his performance as a sober-minded psychologist.  Though, he's not a terribly gifted actor, and I don't see why anyone would want to give him the lead role in a major movie.  Hope Davis, Jason Lee, Alfre Woodard, and Mary McDonnell are also good in their performances as Mumford's patients.I suppose the reason why this movie wasn't very appealing to me was that the plot was too ""by the numbers.""  In fact, there wasn't much of a plot at all.  It relies too much of trying to evoke certain feelings or moods from its audience, which just doesn't ever happen.

Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[4, 6]","Lawrence (Big Chill, Body Heat, Grand Canyon) Kasdan's Mumford is a casually paced, fairly intelligent light comedy.  I knew exactly where it was going and how it was going to get there within ten minutes, yet the writing, acting (casting) was strong enough that I felt the film still offered enough rewards to warrant a strong recommendation (but not a rave)from me.It's a warm fuzzy film, but little more than merely a charming time-killer. We need good little films like this, so please understand this is not a put down.Most folks will know what the twist of the film is, because it was given away in the trailer (criminal that they do this)and even if it's been a while since you've seen it, you'll remember.  That's okay, because at about the films mid-way point, the twist is revealed.  There's some more information that for some might remain a surprise (but I saw it coming).That doesn't mean the film was completely predictable for me.  The joy was for me was the tone of the entire film.  It's not a dumb comedy, but an intelligent one.  It's one where the humor comes from the characters and their believable interactions with each other.  It's a quiet, leisurely paced film.  Kasdan  a master of  duplicating and improving ideas (as in Sayle's Return of the Seacacus 7 into Big Chill) or modernizing genres (such as Out of the Past into Body Heat) or here he gives us Mumford as a modern Lubitsch comedy.I really enjoyed a couple of the performances in the film.  My favorite is probably David Paymer's supporting role as a psychiatrist.  He was perfectly cast in a role that wasn't a stretch for him, but there was a real warmth he brought to the role.I was pleasantly surprised at how restrained Martin Short was in his supporting role as a criminal lawyer. Alfre Woodard as usual was perfect in her portrayal of Lily, the black woman who runs the popular Lunch Cafe in town-her acting is usual effortless and always graceful.  Jason Lee as the Paul Allen type rich geek, Skip Skipperton was charming, winning, and believable-though his performance has a few too many look-at me-type forced mannerisms  which someone like Woodard never employs.  Ted Danson's contribution, though short, was spot on.Mary McDonnel who's best performance can be found in John Sayles' underappreciated Passion Fish (with Alfre Woodard) is quite good here, as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown at the age of menopause.Hope Davis who becomes the love interest of Dr. Mumford is also quite good, though her character doesn't develop additional depth as the film progresses which would have added to the film.The weakest link, is is Loren Dean as Mumford.  It's not the actors fault actually, the fault is in how the character has been written -- it's a pity a little more edge couldn't have been given to this too bland character.  He's supposed to be a guy who seamless fits into everyone's lives un-noticed, but the actor disappears into the film without leaving a particularly memorable impression.  He's good, better than adequate, but not a stand out.The film is too slight to get too excited about, but has some nice moments throughout that many will appreciate.  It has a consistent believable tone and pacing throughout that is not artificially inflated to create a more exciting or suspenseful climax.  For some there will be a bit of surprise toward the end of the film, but one the film has earned honestly.There's a story here as well which concerns a new Psychologist in a small town who has a unique way of listening and talking, about and to his patients with respect and warmth.  His impact on the town, his way of reaching most of patients, and his secrets are what drive the narrative.  It's the characters' believable quirks and charms which make the ride enjoyable.Chris Jarmick",3,Enjoyable Above average comedy.,977270400,"12 20, 2000",2000,3800,"['Lawrence', 'Big', 'Chill', 'Body', 'Heat', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'Kasdan', 'Mumford', 'casually', 'paced', 'fairly', 'intelligent', 'light', 'comedy', 'knew', 'exactly', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'there', 'ten', 'minutes', 'yet', 'writing', 'acting', 'casting', 'was', 'strong', 'enough', 'felt', 'film', 'still', 'offered', 'enough', 'rewards', 'warrant', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'not', 'rave', 'me.It', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'merely', 'charming', 'time-killer', 'need', 'good', 'little', 'films', 'so', 'please', 'understand', 'not', 'put', 'down.Most', 'folks', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'twist', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'away', 'trailer', 'criminal', 'do', 'even', 'been', 'while', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'okay', 'films', 'mid-way', 'point', 'twist', 'revealed', 'more', 'information', 'might', 'remain', 'surprise', 'saw', 'coming', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', 'was', 'completely', 'predictable', 'joy', 'was', 'was', 'tone', 'entire', 'film', 'not', 'dumb', 'comedy', 'intelligent', 'one', 'one', 'where', 'humor', 'characters', 'believable', 'interactions', 'other', 'quiet', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'film', 'Kasdan', 'master', 'duplicating', 'improving', 'ideas', 'Sayle', 'Return', 'Seacacus', '7', 'Big', 'Chill', 'modernizing', 'genres', 'such', 'Out', 'Past', 'Body', 'Heat', 'here', 'Mumford', 'modern', 'Lubitsch', 'comedy.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'couple', 'performances', 'film', 'favorite', 'probably', 'David', 'Paymer', 'supporting', 'role', 'psychiatrist', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'there', 'was', 'real', 'warmth', 'brought', 'role.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'restrained', 'Martin', 'Short', 'was', 'supporting', 'role', 'criminal', 'lawyer', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'usual', 'was', 'perfect', 'portrayal', 'Lily', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'popular', 'Lunch', 'Cafe', 'town-her', 'acting', 'usual', 'effortless', 'always', 'graceful', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'type', 'rich', 'geek', 'Skip', 'Skipperton', 'was', 'charming', 'winning', 'believable-though', 'performance', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'look-at', 'me-type', 'forced', 'mannerisms', 'someone', 'Woodard', 'never', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'contribution', 'short', 'was', 'spot', 'on.Mary', 'McDonnel', 'who', 'best', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'John', 'Sayles', 'underappreciated', 'Passion', 'Fish', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'woman', 'verge', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'age', 'menopause.Hope', 'Davis', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'Dr.', 'Mumford', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'character', ""n't"", 'develop', 'additional', 'depth', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'film.The', 'weakest', 'link', 'Loren', 'Dean', 'Mumford', 'not', 'actors', 'fault', 'actually', 'fault', 'how', 'character', 'been', 'written', 'pity', 'little', 'more', 'edge', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'given', 'too', 'bland', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'guy', 'who', 'fits', 'everyone', 'lives', 'un-noticed', 'actor', 'film', 'leaving', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'impression', 'good', 'better', 'adequate', 'not', 'stand', 'out.The', 'film', 'too', 'slight', 'get', 'too', 'excited', 'nice', 'moments', 'many', 'will', 'appreciate', 'consistent', 'believable', 'tone', 'pacing', 'not', 'artificially', 'inflated', 'create', 'more', 'exciting', 'suspenseful', 'climax', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'surprise', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'film', 'earned', 'story', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'Psychologist', 'small', 'town', 'who', 'unique', 'way', 'listening', 'talking', 'about', 'patients', 'respect', 'warmth', 'impact', 'town', 'way', 'reaching', 'most', 'patients', 'secrets', 'are', 'what', 'drive', 'narrative', 'characters', 'believable', 'quirks', 'charms', 'make', 'ride', 'Jarmick']",Mumford VHS

We meet many of his patients, who all improve  by the end of the film, making the film somewhat like  &quot;Pleasantville&quot; except not quite so impossible.  Everything that  happens in Mumford could happen, but might not all happen in the same small  town on or about the same day. Or then it might, if the patients involved  had Mumford as a therapist.Hope Davis plays a young woman suffering  from chronic fatigue syndrome that is sapping her strength and making her  every move exhausting. She's divorced and has returned to her home towm of  Mumford, where she is living with her parents. Her father brings her to see  Dr. Mumford and his unique personality and methods help. For ethical  reasons, psychologists are not supposed to fall in love with their  patients, or if they do should break off therapy.  Mumford's attraction to  Hope Davis causes him some trouble, but it's only one of the many problems  has to solve.The movie is filled with wonderful characters played by  fine actors.

Dr. Mumford (Loren Dean) is a recently arrived psychologist in the town of Mumford, who has quickly developed a large clientele despite his unorthodox  methods.  We observe his sessions with a variety of odd characters, many of  whom he cuts off in mid sentence or throws out of his office  completely.`Mumford' reminds me a little of `The Muse' where Sharon  Stone plays a muse who helps Hollywood types to find their lost talents.  Both Mumford and the muse were not what they appeared to be, but helped  people anyway because the people just needed something to believe in.Nothing about this film really overwhelmed me.  The characters were  interesting and the script mildly funny.  It tried to be a comedy sometimes  and a romance at others and it was mediocre in both regards.  It succeeded  best as a character study of Mumford and his unusual patients.Loren Dean  was a bit too deadpan as Mumford, playing the part much more impassively  than we would expect after we learn a little about his past.  Hope Davis  was terrific as Sofie, the victim of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  She looked  so weak, frail and constantly out of breath, it was very difficult to tell  that she wasn't really sick during the filming.  Jason Lee also gave a fine  performance as Skip.

It is a quiet, beautifully acted ensemble film that wears well indeed.Mumford (the underused Loren Dean) is a man with a variegated past who settles into a little town by the name of Mumford, decides he will listen to people talk, be a sounding board for folks who are in need of communication in this basically non-communicative world, and becomes a 'Psychologist' in every sense of the word - the good sense.  The manner in which he listens to the many people within the little town is mesmerizing and insightful and the citizens he encounters and assists are varied and beautifully sculpted vulnerable human beings.  The fine cast includes Hope Davis, Jason Lee (in one his finest roles), Mary McDonnell, Alfre Woodard, Zooey Deschanel, Martin Short, David Paymer, Kevin Tighe, Ted Danson, Jason Ritter and even more.The dialogue is introspective, healing, edgy, and entertaining and the overall feeling left with the viewer at the end of the piece is one of wishing more 'Mumfords' would be around our neighborhoods - or rather that we all could become 'Mumfords' with a little conviction and concern for our fellow beings.

Loren Dean plays a psychologist named Mumford who lives in a small town called Mumford. Mumford is the most popular psychologist in town, although his methods are a bit strange. He tells other people what his clients have told him, he kicks people out of his office and still maintains a level of popularity. Among his patients are Pruitt Taylor Vince (Trapped, Monster) as a man who has film-noirish fantasies in which he sees himself as a large muscular man. Jason Lee (Mallrats, My Name is Earl) as a young billionaire who can't find happiness. Zooey Deschanel (Winter Passing, Elf) as a young girl who's addicted to...magazines. Mary McDonnel as Althea, a woman obsessed with buying things. And finally, Hope Davis (About Schmidt, The Weather Man) as Sofie, a woman suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.While some of these characters are just there, Mumford befriends Jason Lee's character Skip and falls in love with Sofie. Martin Short is also in the film, an extended cameo basically, as a criminal lawyer who was kicked out of Mumford's office and seeks revenge.

To wit: in a Lawrence Kasdan film, no one is unhappy who does not want to be; no problems are such that they cannot be overcome with a little willpower, a moment of recognition, or (most often) a relationship with the right person; the right person, inevitably, is someone who shares your likes and/or dislikes (such as long hot showers and the NBA Celtics teams of the 1980s), and given such a foundation any fundamental differences are inconsequential.In this framework, in ""Mumford"" we are presented with a psychologist of the same name, practicing in a town of the same name, albeit in a somewhat unconventional fashion: he is prone to revealing his patients' confessions to other patients, to romantic morning walks with one particular patient, etc. He is, in short, not actually a psychologist at all, and it is this deception that provides the closest thing to real conflict that this film has to offer. Certainly, Dr. ""Mumford""'s patients don't provide any: one (very wealthy) man's loneliness is instantly cured by an introduction to Mumford's downstairs neighbor; a teenaged girl suffering from a marginal case of anorexia is healed by a romance with a classmate; said classmate's mother, suffering from a pathological acquisition syndrome, frees herself from an oppressive relationship with an acquisitive investment banker to start up a presumably healthier one with the local hardware salesman, who is in turn saved from the predations of his own sexual fantasies; and, most centrally, a chronically exhausted blond waif is saved by a relationship with Mumford himself.The network of relationships, and the mild, largely superficial psychological problems they (without exception) serve to overcome, is completely contrived, served up as it is with a minimum of difficulty, of disagreement, of human conflict. This is a movie to watch and feel good about. Mumford's deception, a violation of a most fundamental sort for his patients, is here treated lightly and forgiven instantly. Where there is no pain, there is no joy, and no struggle, no release, and just so this movie, for all its feel-goodism, rolls off too easily.

This is just a relaxing film with subtle humor, good acting and some good dramatic points. The film feels like we're in a small town back in the nineteen fifties. It's just a great film.Loren Dean stars as Doctor Mumford a new phsycologist to the town of Mumford. He seems to be helping everyone, especially a young woman (played wonderfully by Hope Davis) who has a sort of syndrome. After Mumford befriends multi-billionare computer software maker Skip Skipperton (played subtly and hilarious by my favorite, Jason Lee). Mumford and Skipperton become real close and he tells Skipperton that he's not a real doctor. He has a fake name, and he just wanted to get a second chance at life. That's all I can tell you for now. It's a very nice film that just warms the soul. The acting is so well, and so calm it's great. Alfre Woodard warms the soul and has so much acting talent as always. Ted Danson also has a small role, but he just plays himself. Martin Short is in this film, his role is annoying and I really didn't like it. But besides that I really liked this film. It shows that sometimes we ALL need a second chances, and we shouldn't always hold someone's past against them.

476944,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,6305763313,Thomas Glebe,"[2, 2]","Lawrence Kasdan, who has written and/or directed/produced many films, taking one or more such tasks upon himself over decades, first truly came to my conscious name-recognition attention (forgetting his contributions to ""Star Wars""), when I initially saw his ""Grand Canyon"" in a theater and loved it.  That was at the beginning of the 90's.  I continued to watch it since again and again on the small screen, and have retained a unique fondness for the film throughout the years.  Not only is it a great film, but it rings true for me personally as an accurate portrayal of several cross-sections of people in LA, the city of Angels, and what it all seemed like when I resided there at least.  While lots of other films have dealt and continue to deal brilliantly with dissecting LA life and characters, few before Kasdan's ""Grand Canyon,"" have left as lasting an impact on me.At the end of the 90's, his (written, produced and directed) by ""Mumford"" hit theaters and later, video, DVD and cable.  Throughout the new millennium, I had vaguely heard of this film's title (as a kind of ""cult classic""), many times before I finally saw it for myself nearly a decade later on TV.  I was stunned and remain so, at just how good this is, and this particular movie has so touched and enlightened me during repeated viewings, that I eventually paid close attention to the credits, and eventually researched it a bit only to find out who was responsible for this.  Belatedly thus, a big thank you to Mr. Kasdan for another grand winner!  Unlike in ""Grand Canyon"" however, where Kasdan paints with broad strokes about the big Orange, in ""Mumford,"" he deals with a small town instead.  This time around, using more subtle but detailed strokes of deep insight into the general human experience, mixing just the right amounts of light comedy with compelling drama, Kasdan has created a truly timeless masterpiece of a film dealing with various human interactions, relationships, and appeals to all of us to simply try to just try to listen to each other, with love.Regardless of how many times you watch it, and sometimes it's better to allow some time between viewings, it seems like as with ""Grand Canyon,"" there is always something new to discover about humanity and our little places in it all, upon repeated enjoyments.  Instead of dealing with the mad, immense urban sprawl of LA however, Kasdan drops us into a totally different environment, yet succeeds in spades at making almost every moment not only original and surprising, but at all times compelling, magical and unforgettable throughout.  That is quite a trick!  ""Mumford"" has become for me, not only one of the best movies I've ever seen, but is truly one of the very few, really honest films ""Hollywood"" has ever made, in my opinion, about the whole ""Yakkity-Yak, Don't Talk Back"" world of what oftentimes passes for modern, traditional, non-cognitive ""professional"" psychotherapy.  If you're in need of a ""feel good"" experience and don't have access to or can afford the ""real"" thing (either drugs or therapy or both), this film is the next best thing, and is sure to lift your spirits and leave you, at least temporarily, a generally better, kinder, more thoughtful, and introspective person after each viewing.""Mumford"" is a supposedly fictional little town in America (compared cynically to ""Mayberry"" from the Andy Griffith show at one point by a character in the film), where a ""licensed"" psychotherapist by the same last name as the town itself, strangely enough, has for awhile, been running a successful ""practice"" with lots of grateful and returning ""patients.""  Those patients, who continue to see benefits in his seemingly schooled yet at times suspiciously odd/different therapy methods, all gain much in the end.  In fact, this is one of few movies where everyone wins in the end, including the viewer.  And I offer no ""spoilers"" here, because I envy those who check this out for the first time and are as surprised at how good it is, like I was.  The fact that this was more or less a box-office bomb after release or that it received almost no awards from the ""awarding"" Hollyweird establishment, shouldn't sway one from setting aside time to see this wonderful delight however.A very enjoyable, simple, linear approach to this warm, fuzzy, rather straightforward, yet eventually powerful narrative material, with a first rate ensemble cast, adds to the many surprises along the way, and yes, there are many.  Including recurring old time, black and white corny movie ""film noir"" sequences and a great montage revealing the true story of how ""Dr. Mumford"" became who he became.  Various other unique editing and directorial techniques, some disconcerting at first, but most easily accepted and understood in short time, add to the pleasure.  And this movie also has one of the best written screenplays I've ever seen transferred to film.  Whether this went through a few re-writes or many, the final results are breathtakiningly tight, and there is no filler here.  The writing, character development, and pace here are completely right-on, from beginning to end.Kudos and props overdue for a great group of actors, every character evidently and carefully thought out, written, and played out with great casting, some from Kasdan's previous works or studio involvements.  These include but are certainly not limited to nice guy/good listener Loren Dean (""Dr. Mumford""), the beautiful, hopelessly lovable Hope Davis (""Sofie""), Mary McDonnell and Alfre Woodard (from ""Grand Canyon""), Jason Lee, Martin Short, Ted Danson, a young Zooey Deschanel in an early memorable role, and countless others.Finally, James Newton Howard, musical score producer (who also did the music for ""Grand Canyon""), is to be commended, although the real music star/track here is Bob Seger's ""Till It Shines,"" used at precisely the right time in the film and summing it all up with its generally upbeat tone, message, and lyrics.  This is a song which will haunt your consciousness, and/or ""secret"" subconscious, and is a great featured track which perfectly sums up this whole beautiful film, and its overall message to all of us.  That we're all really just psychotherapists to the friends, family and loved ones in our lives, as they can be for us.",5,"""I am not now, nor have I ever been, a psychologist...""",1222300800,"09 25,
