1613328,A2E86XWGYF631O,B00AMFKPXA,Andrew Hill,"[0, 2]","I did not really expect much from this disc as I have been extremely disappointed in the 3D videography in many of the nature documentary features lately - and this is not a BBC or IMAX production.  What a surprise!  The 3D is shot with the ""window"" purposely set back so that many items in the view actually DO COME OUT OF THE SCREEN ON A REGULAR BASIS.  It is a disc that I will be using to illustrate proper 3D camerawork.As to the content - well, it is just as others have described.  90% of the content is that of the jungle plants in the Amazon forests, and of the water levels in those forests at various times of the year when the Amazon floods the plains.  Very little content of animals.  And the narration, mostly in the middle section of the disc, is up to 15 seconds ahead of the pictures it is describing - and it can get quite annoying.  This is a pressing or editing fault and really should have been discovered.  And the lag time varies through-out the disc.  The music, on the other hand, does cue up to the photography - but it tends to get monotonous.So, if you are interested in 3D videography - get this disc.  If you are interested in an interesting video on the Amazon - by all means get the IMAX 2D Blu-ray ""Amazon,"" it is far more informative and entertaining.

Quite a few of those moments in the film as well as too many shots of water, plants and trees and not nearly enough shots of the wild and insect life. I'll also add that there are some very nice 3D shots in the movie.  There's one when it's raining and the rain is outside of the screen and others where large plant leaves extend outwards.  There are also shots that have great depth.  There are no atmospheric sounds, just wall to wall music that is relaxing but it can't compare to sounds of the animals, birds and insects in the rain forest.",2,Disappointed,1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,677,"[""'ll"", 'echo', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'lingering', 'shots', 'subject', 'narrator', 'had', 'already', 'moved', 'next', 'subject', 'few', 'moments', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'too', 'many', 'shots', 'water', 'plants', 'trees', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'shots', 'wild', 'insect', 'life', ""'ll"", 'also', 'add', 'are', 'very', 'nice', '3D', 'shots', 'movie', 'one', 'when', 'raining', 'rain', 'screen', 'others', 'where', 'large', 'plant', 'extend', 'outwards', 'are', 'also', 'shots', 'have', 'great', 'depth', 'are', 'atmospheric', 'sounds', 'just', 'wall', 'wall', 'music', 'relaxing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'sounds', 'animals', 'birds', 'insects', 'rain', 'forest']",AMAZON 3D - In The Heart Of Wild Nature

1613335,A22K9LJL278AF1,B00AMFKPXA,"William ""William""","[0, 0]","Lets start off with the positives:The 3D is shot with actual 3D cameras. There are some amazing shots that pop out of the screen.The narration is remarkably better than Ken Wright's previous releases.The bitrate is noticably higher than it was on Europe's Most Beautiful Places.They seem to be using newer cameras than they did on Europe's Most Beautiful Places.There is a music-only trackNow for the negativesI wasn't able to get past 20 minutes of this. Maybe the BBC and Discovery has spoiled me, but I found this boring. This is very much an amature production. The entire show looks like it was filmed in a wildlife perserve - in one of the early shots, there is clearly a fence in the picture.Some shots seem to be recycled over and over again.This is mostly a video of plants. Kinda misleading compared to the cover image.Narration around the 15 minute mark gets to where it is about 20-30 seconds ahead of what is onscreen. They are talking about iguanas, but you are looking at images of grasshoppers. They start talking about a a rainbow lizard, and they switch to the video of the iguana. They then start talking about the river, and switch to the video of the lizard. Music when we see the river, then they start talking about a yellow-feathered bird, but you are looking at white birds. When you do see the yellow birds, music is playing.The 3D depth of field jumps greatly from one shot to the next. Many of the early shots are shot from a distance, and there is almost no 3D effect. Quick transition to a closeup of a branch sticking out of the screen, and as soon as your eyes and brain adjust, you are thrown into another shot with another 3D depth being used. The issue is - while the shots individually look neat, the constantly changing field of depth produces headaches. I had to pause the video after only 10 minutes and shut it off completely after 20, and I can normally sit thorugh an entire 2-3 hour 3D movie.Some shots look like they were shot without adjusting the iris or color balance on the camera.In a nutshell, its NOT HORRIBLE, but it certainly was not what I was expecting. I will admit, though, that my expectations were lower after having a couple of this guy's other discs, which may be why I am not being as hard on the discs as others are.Just don't go into this expecting a professional production. There are some amazing shots here, but just be prepared for watching a lot of plants.",2,"Not horrible, just was not what I was expecting",1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,2425,"['Lets', 'start', 'positives', '3D', 'shot', 'actual', '3D', 'cameras', 'are', 'amazing', 'shots', 'pop', 'screen.The', 'narration', 'remarkably', 'better', 'Ken', 'Wright', 'previous', 'releases.The', 'bitrate', 'noticably', 'higher', 'was', 'Europe', 'Most', 'Beautiful', 'Places.They', 'seem', 'be', 'using', 'newer', 'cameras', 'did', 'Europe', 'Most', 'Beautiful', 'Places.There', 'music-only', 'trackNow', 'negativesI', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'get', 'past', '20', 'minutes', 'Maybe', 'BBC', 'Discovery', 'spoiled', 'found', 'boring', 'very', 'much', 'amature', 'production', 'entire', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', 'wildlife', 'perserve', 'one', 'early', 'shots', 'clearly', 'fence', 'picture.Some', 'shots', 'seem', 'be', 'recycled', 'again.This', 'mostly', 'video', 'plants', 'Kinda', 'misleading', 'compared', 'cover', 'image.Narration', '15', 'minute', 'mark', 'where', '20-30', 'seconds', 'ahead', 'what', 'onscreen', 'are', 'talking', 'iguanas', 'are', 'looking', 'images', 'grasshoppers', 'start', 'talking', 'rainbow', 'lizard', 'switch', 'video', 'iguana', 'then', 'start', 'talking', 'river', 'switch', 'video', 'lizard', 'Music', 'when', 'see', 'river', 'then', 'start', 'talking', 'yellow-feathered', 'bird', 'are', 'looking', 'white', 'birds', 'When', 'do', 'see', 'yellow', 'birds', 'music', 'playing.The', '3D', 'depth', 'field', 'jumps', 'greatly', 'one', 'shot', 'next', 'Many', 'early', 'shots', 'are', 'shot', 'distance', 'almost', '3D', 'effect', 'Quick', 'transition', 'closeup', 'branch', 'sticking', 'screen', 'as', 'soon', 'eyes', 'brain', 'adjust', 'are', 'thrown', 'shot', '3D', 'depth', 'being', 'used', 'issue', 'shots', 'individually', 'look', 'neat', 'constantly', 'changing', 'field', 'depth', 'produces', 'headaches', 'had', 'pause', 'video', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'shut', 'off', 'completely', '20', 'can', 'normally', 'sit', 'entire', '2-3', 'hour', '3D', 'movie.Some', 'shots', 'look', 'were', 'shot', 'adjusting', 'iris', 'color', 'balance', 'camera.In', 'nutshell', 'NOT', 'HORRIBLE', 'certainly', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'will', 'admit', 'though', 'expectations', 'were', 'lower', 'having', 'couple', 'guy', 'other', 'discs', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'am', 'not', 'being', 'as', 'hard', 'discs', 'others', 'are.Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'professional', 'production', 'are', 'amazing', 'shots', 'here', 'just', 'be', 'prepared', 'watching', 'lot', 'plants']",AMAZON 3D - In The Heart Of Wild Nature
