856752,A257UC0ST4FFAY,B00062IESC,"80sLady ""PRG""","[4, 7]","I felt that this movie was completely pointless. It is about a family who searches South Africa looking for diamonds.  The main character, Johnny, gets taken in by this old man, aka Jacob Van der Byl, who treats him like a son for the first twelve years of his life than promptly (and quite brutally) kicks him out of the house for no apparent reason.  Obviously, Van der Byl must've sensed the upcoming attraction between Johnny and his daughter Tracy and tried to put a stop to it before anything started!Fast forward about twenty years and Van der Byl contacts Johnny and invites him to join in the family business because 1) Van der Byl is dying, 2) his biological son is too incompetant to take over the family business and 3) he no longer cares about keeping his daughter Tracy and Johnny from getting it on.  Why Johnny would even want to get back involved with a swarmy guy like Van der Byl is beyond me.  Even stranger, nice guy Johnny trusts crooked ""bro"" Benedict.  Talk about family loyalty!Too much talent(literally) got swept away in the water in this movie!Note:  Those of you who are wondering what happened to Tracy's husband after he ""slipped"" in the the pool and was left for dead, fear not!  Later on, it's revealed that Tracy gives him a divorce.  I didn't see that one coming!",2,Great cast!

Dean ""John""","[3, 5]","Amazing how many people thought the acting just was not worthy of the names in the movie - that was my thought as well.Disjointed plot that just wandered aimlessly, and saying it was contrived would imply that they were forcing things to go in a certain direction, which clearly they were not.This is about the worst job of acting I've seen in years, and from people we know can do better.There was no chemistry between any of them, and they certainly didn't draw any emotions (other than boredom) from the audience...The story was rehashed in another review, so all I'll do is add my own agreement that this was a total waste of time not just for me, but for anyone involved in the movie as well...  And every time you thought, ""Maybe this is it? Maybe something will happen here that makes sense?"" you realize you were just disappointed again.  And I'm not even going to bother with the ending...  About the only good thing in the whole film was when the credits rolled and I finally could turn it off...I almost never feel compelled to post a review for a bad movie, but this one was so bad that I had to add my voice to those warning others from wasting time on this.",1,There's time I'll never get back...,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,1171,"['Amazing', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'thought', 'acting', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'worthy', 'names', 'movie', 'was', 'thought', 'well.Disjointed', 'plot', 'just', 'wandered', 'aimlessly', 'saying', 'was', 'contrived', 'would', 'imply', 'were', 'forcing', 'things', 'go', 'certain', 'direction', 'clearly', 'were', 'not.This', 'worst', 'job', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'people', 'know', 'can', 'do', 'better.There', 'was', 'chemistry', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'draw', 'emotions', 'other', 'boredom', 'audience', 'story', 'was', 'rehashed', 'review', ""'ll"", 'do', 'add', 'own', 'agreement', 'was', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'anyone', 'involved', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'thought', 'Maybe', 'Maybe', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'here', 'sense', 'realize', 'were', 'just', 'disappointed', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'bother', 'ending', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'finally', 'could', 'turn', 'off', 'almost', 'never', 'feel', 'compelled', 'post', 'review', 'bad', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'add', 'voice', 'warning', 'others', 'wasting', 'time']",N/A
