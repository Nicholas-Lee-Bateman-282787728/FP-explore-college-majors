1243693,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001VGL0I8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","I sometimes daydream that somewhere undisclosed rests a colossal secret vault that holds Region 1 DVDs of cinematic gems that, for this or that reason, have yet to see the light of day. I like to think that 1954's THE DETECTIVE sits in high pile purgatory in that vault. There's a VHS copy out and about, and a Region 2 DVD for them Brits. THE DETECTIVE features one of my very favorite Alec Guinness performances. It's based in huge part on G.K. Chesterton's first Father Brown short story, ""The Blue Cross.""It's been a bit since I boned up on G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown stories. So I can't rightly recall how faithful Guinness' interpretation is to the source character. This cinematic version is mild-mannered and unpretentious and accomodating, and I'm firm in stating that those traits fit the book version's demeanor. But Guinness' Father Brown is also adept with pickpocketing and he occasionally engages in wrestling matches. What's not been changed is his uncanny insight into the depravity of man.Father Ignatius Brown is an odd duck. The film opens with the police busting in and there's Father Brown caught in the act. Except that continued observation informs that he's not taking money out of that safe but, rather, putting money BACK in. Father Brown has a certain rep with the bobbies; they know he fancies himself an amateur sleuth. He doesn't stay behind bars too long. See, Father Brown attends to his ongoing mission, that of redeeming lost souls. That safecracker, him what the Father had intercepted earlier, gets a second chance.The central plot begins when our clerical sleuth learns that the Eucharistic Congress is to convene in Rome and that the invaluable Holy Cross of St. Augustine, currently housed in Father Brown's churce, is intended to travel to the site. Here's the rub: the notorious international thief known as ""Monsieur Flambeau"" has proposed to add the cross to his collection. Off goes Father Brown, aiming for the Eternal City, wrapping the cross in a parcel, securing it with twine, eyes on alert for French nogoodniks. Except that no one knows what M. Flambeau looks like. He's a ""human chameleon, a master of disguise."" But never mind that. Huge chunks of the film take place in France, in Flambeau's bailiwick, as he and the unassuming priest soon enough are matching wits.I grin at those little moments in which Guinness, gleam in his eyes, exhibit Father Brown's perceptiveness. While G.K. Chesterton has written of Brown's investigative style as more intuitive than deductive, Guinness' Brown demonstrates that he's as keenly observant as Sherlock Holmes. Throughout the film, as Brown persists in piercing his adversary's deceptions, a baffled (and impressed) Flambeau would ask how Brown keeps on finding him. There's a sense of viewer gratification as Brown mildly points out Flambeau's mistakes, the first of which hinges on a ham sandwich. An ongoing cat-and-mouse game has quickly developed, but there's no animosity. After all, he's a priest, and he's French.THE DETECTIVE is a British gem, adeptly executed, smartly written, marvelously comic as only the Brits can do it. That it's an obscure bit of cinema today is a real shame. It's spearheaded by Guinness, who others may say is in rare form except that he's usually this very good and this dialed in and this playful. He's ably supported by a superb cast, especially Peter Finch. How does it end? Does it resolve with an unrepentant sinner or with faith restored?
