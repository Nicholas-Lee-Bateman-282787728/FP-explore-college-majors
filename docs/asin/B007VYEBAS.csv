1539074,A13UPPKNU1BO13,B007VYEBAS,A. Irey,"[5, 5]","The big headline for this card was title fight featuring Jon Jones and Rashad Evans.  With a lot of emotion coming from both sides on this one we were looking at could possibly be the most heated title fight since Liddell/Ortiz II back at UFC 66.Starting the night off was Mark Bocek against John Alessio.  Mark Bocek has been a pretty good go in the lightweight division with most of his losses only coming to the top of the division, and that's saying a lot as the lightweight division is the most stacked division in the entire UFC in my opinion.  So it was announced that John Alessio was making his UFC return against Bocek there was good reason to worry.  Alessio has been all over, fighting in the UFC, WEC, PRIDE, and Dream to name a few promotions, and was going into this fight with on a three fight win streak.  The one thing about this fight was that it seems to almost hit the second gear where things look kinda exciting and then it doesn't exactly go any further than it should did.  It's pretty one sided with a majority of control being performed by one fighter.Mark Hominick may be most recognized by fighters as the man who fought Jose Aldo in front of his hometown crowd at UFC 129 last year and failed to capture the title in what was a fun fight.  Unfortunately he has since been victim to what was tied as the fastest knockout in UFC history following his next fight against Chan-Sung Jung.  After that loss Hominick was looking to get back to his winning ways and end the fight in spectacular fashion.  His opponent, Eddie Yagin, is a relative newcomer in the UFC and lost in his debut.  So, looking to set his foot in the door the way he had originally intended the Hawaiian featherweight went into this fight looking to swing off Hominick's head.  The fight ended up being one of the bloodiest slug-fests I've seen in recent memory.  What was so great about this fight though was the fact that both fighters had their moments to shine each showcasing their particular brand of striking which was sharply contrasted.  This is definitely the fight of the night to check out.What would mark the middle of the was a bantamweight collision between Miguel Torres and Michael McDonald.  Torres is well known for his time in the WEC where he was the longtime bantamweight champion of the company and one of the great pound-for-pound fighters in the world.  Since coming into the UFC after being dethroned he has been on and off, almost exactly as the phrase dictates.  He's won his debut, lost against Demetrious Johnson, and then won against Nick Pace.  So, looking to build something of a winning streak in his UFC career he was looking to stop the train known as Michael McDonald.  McDonald is gonna hit a lot of people's radars if they don't already know about him.  Going into this fight with a record of 14 and 1 he has demonstrated an extremely explosive striking style and has been of the one of the few bantamweights to demonstrate one shot knockout power.  With these kind of ingredients this had all the makings of one of the best fights of the night or one of the shortest fights.  What happened was the latter as this fight ends little over halfway through the first round with a quick and cementing KO.  The most startling thing about this victory is the message it looks to send throughout the bantamweight division on winner and where he stands in the divisions top fighters.I wasn't exactly sure how this next fight was going to play out.  Brendan Schaub has demonstrated some impressive speed for a heavyweight and holds notable victories over Mirko Cro Cop and Garbiel Gonzaga before being stopped by Antonio Rodrgio Nogueira last year.  Ben Rothwell is a different kind of heavyweight.  He doesn't resemble the same kind of speed that can be seen in Schaub but looks more like a traditional heavyweight, he may not be built for speed but possess the the kind of knockout power that crumble the opponent in one hit, while also holding a decent overall set of skills.  Not surprisingly the feel out period between these two was pretty short and then before long the two just started some insane flurries against one another in the hope that they would put the other down.  In the maelstrom of punches thrown eventually we see one fighter get rocked and just as the other goes in for the kill we are treated to an absolutely incredible comeback strike.  While this fight is short it should definitely be seen.After coming off of his destructive display against Mike Pyle there were was a lot of questions in terms of where Rory MacDonald would go with his career.  He looked to have all the makings of the next welterweight champion: brutal strength, great overall technique, the stamina to go at a hard pace for three full rounds, and the youth and age to still improve while already demonstrating so much potential.  So when it was announced that he was going to take on Che Mills I thought that this would be an interesting test to see where he stands in terms of all the hype he's built around himself.  Che Mills may not be well known by most UFC casual fans but he is an incredible striker with some devastating technique which was demonstrated in his debut.  When these two collided it was furious from the get go.  Then just as it started one of the fighters strengths took over and the rest was complete and brutal domination.  Trust me when I say that the victor looked downright scary.  The most interesting questions about this fight will be where the victor goes from here.They were once training partners in Greg Jackson's camp.  During that time Evans was originally scheduled to face Shogun Rua last March at UFC 128 before injury took him out and he was replaced by Jon Jones who would go on to become the youngest UFC champion in history as well as have one of the best years ever in the history of the business.  Then, things turned sour.  Friendships dissolved and then it came down to who would knock the others block off during the title fight.  A lot of heat came into this fight and while I could explain what happened things went down less than what I thought they would.  I believe this fight boils down to strategies.  I believe the victor really played out a very good plan, and unfortunately for his opponent, the plan played out so well there were rarely any parts that looked as if he was in danger.  Honestly, the opponent really should of used a better strategy than playing to the strengths of the victor.  Just my opinion.  Overall, not a bad fight.  It just didn't exactly have the heat that I expected to play out and there were a few moments of excitement but overall a pretty tame title fight.The main card of this fight was really fun.  Honestly, I think it was a good card that's only marred a bit by the first and last fight of the nights with most of the middle carrying some strong excitement.  I actually believe the middle of the card carries more fun and significance than the rest, but that's just my opinion.",4,UFC 145...,1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,6992,"['big', 'headline', 'card',

1539075,AYWSFRCIMOAYE,B007VYEBAS,Cestmoi,"[0, 0]","There 3 riveting fights in this DVD. It deserves 5 starsThe first one was between Mark Hominick and Eddie Yagin. It's an even match. Both of them steadily exchanged fists. No one seemed to be better than the other. Then at 1 minute 30 seconds of round 1, fighter 1 was knocked down.  Then fighter 2 got on top of him and kept pounding him. Fighter 1 now got cuts around both of his eyes. They were covered with blood but he kept pressing. It's amazing!In round 2, at 1 minute 49 seconds, fighter 1 was knocked down again. Again fighter 2 was on top of him and kept pounding him. Then at 2 minutes 44 seconds, fighter 1 was able to get up. Then he made fighter 2 pay. Now, fighter 2's face was covered in blood.After 3 rounds, fighter 1 won by split decisions. It's a suspenseful and unpredictable match.Sorry, I can't refer these fighters by their real names. Otherwise, it will ruin your enjoyment.The second riveting fight was between Brendan Schaub and Ben Rothwell. Fighter 1 kept pressing fighter 2. Then at 1 minute 9 seconds of round 1, fighter 1 was knocked down! It's unbelievable.  You have to see it to believe it.The third interesting fight was between Rory Macdonald and Che Mills. Rory was born in 1989 in British Colombia, Canada. So, at the time of this fight, 2012, he was 23 years old. This fight was also captivating.The main event, Jon Jones versus Rachard Evans was boring because it was so lopsided.In short, this DVD deserves 5 stars.",5,There 3 riveting fights in this DVD.
