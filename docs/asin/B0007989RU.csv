878478,A1URPQ4S8TJCR4,B0007989RU,Bert vanC Bailey,"[1, 1]","This is a marvellous little black comedy about what happens upon the return from the US of Freja (Margret Vilhjalmsdottir) to her Icelandic hometown.Actually, it's about the sorry things that happen to those who cross her, or the people in the family-coven that takes her in. But I won't spoil the watching. The setting is an Icelandic fjord village-port; really, a world largely dominated by women. Freya, the main character, is possibly a witch and most certainly a bitch - er, sorry: a force to contend with - but in any case, the tale is told from the child's perspective.Ugla Egilsdotti plays the 11-yr-old Agga. It's a complex role, where Agga must ultimately decide whether to be loyal either to what's right and fair, or to her kind: i.e. women. Egilsdotti is especially promising as an actress. This is a ladies' film pretty much throughout, although there's enough androgyny and misogyny here to keep most any healthy male giggling away with recognition: self- and other!Witty, unusual and ironic throughout, this low-budget flick from a still poorly-known, tiny country is disproportionately well worth watching.****",5,"Unusual, ironic, fresh low-budget flick from Iceland",1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,1127,"['marvellous', 'little', 'black', 'comedy', 'what', 'return', 'US', 'Freja', 'Margret', 'Vilhjalmsdottir', 'Icelandic', 'hometown.Actually', 'sorry', 'things', 'happen', 'who', 'cross', 'people', 'family-coven', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'watching', 'setting', 'Icelandic', 'fjord', 'village-port', 'really', 'world', 'largely', 'dominated', 'women', 'Freya', 'main', 'character', 'possibly', 'witch', 'most', 'certainly', 'bitch', 'er', 'sorry', 'force', 'contend', 'case', 'tale', 'told', 'child', 'perspective.Ugla', 'Egilsdotti', '11-yr-old', 'Agga', 'complex', 'role', 'where', 'Agga', 'must', 'ultimately', 'decide', 'be', 'loyal', 'what', 'right', 'fair', 'kind', 'i.e', 'women', 'Egilsdotti', 'especially', 'promising', 'actress', 'ladies', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'enough', 'androgyny', 'misogyny', 'here', 'keep', 'most', 'healthy', 'male', 'giggling', 'away', 'recognition', 'self-', 'other', 'Witty', 'unusual', 'ironic', 'low-budget', 'flick', 'still', 'poorly-known', 'tiny', 'country', 'disproportionately', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', '****']",The Seagull's Laughter

Was I pleasantly surprised.A chapter in the age-old struggle between the sexes. Here the women are on top. The men of the small Icelandic village are-with the exception of the fisherman grandfather-stupid and often drunken louts. The women are superior-if only by default. It is called a dark comedy, but the men who get bumped off are so loathsome their deaths are not very dark. And the killings are more self-defense in the broader sense than premediated murder.I do disagree with those reviewers who see Freya the cousin who returns from seven years in America as the feminist heroine. Instead Freya is just another attractive female who cunningly uses her sexuality against men. Her quest is merely for material gain and status. She is an Icelandic Becky Sharp.The real hero I think is Agga, wonderfully played by Ugla Egilsdottir. She is a shrewd observer of the follies of the adults around her -with a gift for profitting from their antics. As she matures from age 11 to 14 she comes to understand that the men around her are not to be trusted. She begins to acquire her cousin's sexual allure, but with a deeper understanding of the world than the merely staus-conscious Freya.A superb movie well worth watching and owning.

878480,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0007989RU,C. O. DeRiemer,"[7, 7]","This is an intriguing, deadpan black comedy of women deciding that men often are boors, unreliable and untrustworthy, and while at times nice play things, they always need to be kept in check.It's 1952, and after seven years in America Freya (Margret Vihjalmsdottir) has returned a widow to her small Icelandic fishing village. What happened to the officer she married? It's not quite clear. She's slim, sexual, with trunks of clothes. She's welcomed into the home of her relatives, essentially a house of women whose male head is often away at sea on his fishing trawler. His wife, an elderly, pleasant and straightforward woman, is really the boss, and in the house with her lives her sister-in-law, her two daughters and her granddaughter whose parents died. It's a respectable working class home in a village that is socially divided and proper. Freya, however, is not about to settle for the traditional female status quo. And her 11 year old cousin, Agga (Ugla Egilsdottir), is torn between disliking her intensely and being intrigued with her.Freya is a liberated woman before female liberation was thought of much. She is aware of her sexual power and she's not going to settle for second best. She has a way of strengthening the resolve of the other women around her. And she seems prepared to take drastic action when called upon. The wife-beating drunkard who is the husband of her best friend dies in a mysterious fire. The man she marries who turns out to be tied to his mother's apron strings (and a drunk and adulterer to boot) winds up at the foot of a flight of stairs, dead. At first it's not clear how many of the women may have helped him on his way. And through all of this Agga is observing, and sometimes interfering. The conclusion of the film has Freya an undoubtedly wealthy widow again, who probably is going to wind up running the town. The women she has encountered are considerably more forceful and confident than they would ever have been without her. In some cases some of the other women are probably going to regret she ever came back from America. Agga, too, has changed. From a smart, resentful 11 year-old Agga has become a young woman of 14, starting to be conscious of what being a woman can mean. I have the feeling she's going to remember Freya's lessons.The movie is a comedy, but a comedy with an edge. Freya can be selfish and at times manipulative. Most of the men either seem to be oblivious of what they take for granted or become unselfconscious oafs. The bright male spark comes from a young policeman who doesn't take Agga's stories of Freya seriously...but then begins to notice that Agga isn't just a little girl anymore. The Icelandic scenery is beautiful, bright and cold. And much of the movie's music is pulled from Forties' swing. The opening and closing theme is a quartet singing Sh-boom. I liked the movie and recommend it.The DVD looked great.",4,A Fine Black Comedy With A Strong Woman,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,2905,"['intriguing', 'deadpan', 'black', 'comedy', 'women', 'deciding', 'men', 'often', 'are', 'boors', 'unreliable', 'untrustworthy', 'times', 'nice', 'play', 'things', 'always', 'need', 'be', 'kept', 'check.It', '1952', 'seven', 'years', 'America', 'Freya', 'Margret', 'Vihjalmsdottir', 'returned', 'widow', 'small', 'Icelandic', 'fishing', 'village', 'What', 'happened', 'officer', 'married', 'not', 'quite', 'clear', 'slim', 'sexual', 'trunks', 'clothes', 'welcomed', 'home', 'relatives', 'essentially', 'house', 'women', 'male', 'head', 'often', 'away', 'sea', 'fishing', 'trawler', 'wife', 'elderly', 'pleasant', 'straightforward', 'woman', 'really', 'boss', 'house', 'lives', 'sister-in-law', 'two', 'daughters', 'granddaughter', 'parents', 'died', 'respectable', 'working', 'class', 'home', 'village', 'socially', 'divided', 'proper', 'Freya', 'however', 'not', 'settle', 'traditional', 'female', 'status', 'quo', '11', 'year', 'old', 'cousin', 'Agga', 'Ugla', 'Egilsdottir', 'torn', 'disliking', 'intensely', 'being', 'intrigued', 'her.Freya', 'liberated', 'woman', 'female', 'liberation', 'was', 'thought', 'much', 'aware', 'sexual', 'power', 'not', 'going', 'settle', 'second', 'best', 'way', 'strengthening', 'resolve', 'other', 'women', 'prepared', 'take', 'drastic', 'action', 'when', 'called', 'upon', 'wife-beating', 'drunkard', 'who', 'husband', 'best', 'friend', 'mysterious', 'fire', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'tied', 'mother', 'apron', 'strings', 'drunk', 'adulterer', 'boot', 'up', 'foot', 'flight', 'stairs', 'dead', 'first', 'not', 'clear', 'how', 'many', 'women', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'way', 'Agga', 'observing', 'sometimes', 'interfering', 'conclusion', 'film', 'Freya', 'undoubtedly', 'wealthy', 'widow', 'again', 'who', 'probably', 'going', 'wind', 'up', 'running', 'town', 'women', 'encountered', 'are', 'considerably', 'more', 'forceful', 'confident', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'cases', 'other', 'women', 'are', 'probably', 'going', 'regret', 'ever', 'came', 'back', 'America', 'Agga', 'too', 'changed', 'smart', 'resentful', '11', 'year-old', 'Agga', 'become', 'young', 'woman', '14', 'starting', 'be', 'conscious', 'what', 'being', 'woman', 'can', 'mean', 'have', 'feeling', 'going', 'remember', 'Freya', 'lessons.The', 'movie', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'edge', 'Freya', 'can', 'be', 'selfish', 'times', 'manipulative', 'Most', 'men', 'seem', 'be', 'oblivious', 'what', 'take', 'granted', 'become', 'unselfconscious', 'oafs', 'bright', 'male', 'spark', 'young', 'policeman', 'who', ""n't"", 'take', 'Agga', 'stories', 'Freya', 'seriously', 'then', 'notice', 'Agga', ""n't"", 'just', 'little', 'girl', 'anymore', 'Icelandic', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'bright', 'cold', 'much', 'movie', 'music', 'pulled', 'Forties', 'swing', 'opening', 'closing', 'theme', 'quartet', 'singing', 'Sh-boom', 'liked', 'movie', 'recommend', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'looked', 'great']",The Seagull's Laughter

In the eyes of her young cousin Agga, she is an evil woman, a murderess on the run and one who will kill again. But this is not a mystery, a whodunnit or a thriller. It explores the role of Icelandic women in the 50s, that strange time after the war when women who had gone out to work when their menfolk were away, again find themselves back in their traditional roles as housewives.The film is beautifully shot and evokes a strange, little seen landscape of permanent ice and barren black rock. The landscape is sere, almost devoid of color, which makes Freya's vibrant red, green and blue fashion statements stand out in truly stark contrast.The film was apparently released with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (very wide) but this DVD from HVE (Home Vision Entertainment), affiliated to Criterion, is an open-matte version at 1.85:1 letterboxed into a 16:9 anamorphic widscreen. Very strange. There is no statement to say that this is a director-approved release although the director, Agust Gudmundsson, did write the introductory essay in the accompanying leaflet. Comparing the 1.85:1 main feature to the 2.35:1 versions of the deleted scenes and various trailers, I personally found the 1.85:1 picture composition more satisfying. But this was obviously not the theatrical release version so I'm quite confused.The film is in Icelandic, a little heard language, and the DVD comes with optional English subtitles.Despite the questionable choice of aspect ratio on this DVD, it is still a beautiful transfer of a lovely film and well worth buying.",4,Wickedly subversive Icelandic film...  questionable DVD,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,1697,"['black', 'comedy', 'set', '1950s', 'Freya', 'woman', 'who', 'Iceland', 'spending', 'several', 'years', 'America', 'air', 'mystery', 'eyes', 'young', 'cousin', 'Agga', 'evil', 'woman', 'murderess', 'run', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'kill', 'again', 'not', 'mystery', 'whodunnit', 'thriller', 'role', 'Icelandic', 'women', '50s', 'strange', 'time', 'war', 'when', 'women', 'who', 'had', 'gone', 'out', 'work', 'when', 'menfolk', 'were', 'away', 'again', 'find', 'back', 'traditional', 'roles', 'housewives.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'strange', 'little', 'seen', 'landscape', 'permanent', 'ice', 'barren', 'black', 'rock', 'landscape', 'sere', 'almost', 'devoid', 'color', 'Freya', 'vibrant', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'fashion', 'statements', 'stand', 'out', 'truly', 'stark', 'contrast.The', 'film', 'was', 'apparently', 'released', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.35:1', 'very', 'wide', 'DVD', 'HVE', 'Home', 'Vision', 'Entertainment', 'affiliated', 'Criterion', 'open-matte', 'version', '1.85:1', 'letterboxed', '16:9', 'anamorphic', 'widscreen', 'Very', 'strange', 'statement', 'say', 'director-approved', 'release', 'director', 'Agust', 'Gudmundsson', 'did', 'write', 'introductory', 'essay', 'accompanying', 'leaflet', 'Comparing', '1.85:1', 'main', 'feature', '2.35:1', 'versions', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'various', 'trailers', 'personally', 'found', '1.85:1', 'picture', 'composition', 'more', 'satisfying', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'theatrical', 'release', 'version', ""'m"", 'quite', 'confused.The', 'film', 'Icelandic', 'little', 'heard', 'language', 'DVD', 'optional', 'English', 'subtitles.Despite', 'questionable', 'choice', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'DVD', 'still', 'beautiful', 'transfer', 'lovely', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'buying']",The Seagull's Laughter

The story is full of warmth, humor, paradox, and intrigue.The protaganist, Freya, is beautiful, cunning and principled;is she a witch or a saint? You're never really sure. Agga, her 11-year old foil, tracks her every move and often directs the action; she's a clever and wise 11-year old who's also a kid's kid, given to spontaneous cartwheels and pre-adolescent sulks. Together, the two set an entire town on it's ear and nothing is ever the same.This movie is atmospheric and attentive to detail, from down-covered beds to the crunch of the snow to hanging fish and fresh-brewed coffee. All create a distinctive sense of time and place. And the magnificent, Icelandic light and austere terrain is breathtakingly beautiful.A lot of the story is charming/funny, even quizzical, like the women's subdued reactions to catastrophic or unexpected news, or the grandfather's blythe acceptance of the wacky antics of his estrogen-laden household.

Yes, it's sort of a comedy, but a distinctly dark one. There is an abundance of irony, but not many laugh out loud moments. Interestingly, the most sympathetic characters are three of the oldest: two older women who work in a fishery and the husband of one of them, an old fisherman with strong socialist leanings. Class distinctions and snobbery of the Iceland of the early 1950s are an important undercurrent. Freyja, the main character, is an intense and headstrong seductress with a number of admirable qualities. But, and that's a crucial but, those are not the only qualities she possesses. It probably helps to know that Freyja is the name of a Norse goddess. This goddess is often associated with lust as well as battle and death. Those with some knowledge of Icelandic lore would probably realize the significance of Freyja's nightly walks. Not knowing this, however, probably does not detract too much from the movie.

878484,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0007989RU,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[4, 4]","This remarkable little dark comedy from Iceland is not so little. It tells a rambling story of women in a remote part of the world dealing with men who make poor marriage material. From the three village drunks to an engineer in a fine house, there is not a one to provide a secure home and a lasting relationship. A handsome young policeman seems the sole exception, but he has trouble accepting the truth about this war between men and women when he's presented with the facts, which happen to come from the mouth of an 11-year-old girl he believes is making up stories. When she finally grows into a young woman herself, he's ready to believe her, but by then she has become self-protective and deceptive, like all the older women before her.Set in the early 1950s it centers on the affairs of several women living together in the house of an older sailor who is for the most part at sea and earns a degree of respect within the framework of the film by being a) a socialist and b) absent most of the time. A cousin returning from America after the sudden death of her young husband (a murder?) settles in with them and makes her presence known in town as a kind of Rita Hayworth in its midst, catching the eye of its most eligible bachelor while taking matters into her own hands when the men who cross her path step out of line. Full of ironies and dark humor (it begins and ends with the Crew Cuts' song ""Shboom""), the film is also beautifully photographed with a large cast of characters. The DVD has a brief making-of featurette and deleted scenes.
