The tenderness, expression of emotions and fascinating science of observing nature up close are worth every minute. This is a lovely film, good as a learning tool and good movie-making. I am glad the story was told and the wisdom infused throughout the piece should be part of all classrooms as an instructional piece of the conflict between recreational management of nature and the need for protection and further understanding of natural processes and needs.",5,Superb film-making and story,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,513,"['insightful', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'tenderness', 'expression', 'emotions', 'fascinating', 'science', 'observing', 'nature', 'up', 'close', 'are', 'worth', 'minute', 'lovely', 'film', 'good', 'learning', 'tool', 'good', 'movie-making', 'am', 'glad', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'wisdom', 'infused', 'piece', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'classrooms', 'instructional', 'piece', 'conflict', 'recreational', 'management', 'nature', 'need', 'protection', 'further', 'understanding', 'natural', 'processes', 'needs']",Nature: Touching the Wild - Living With Mule Deer

Once again, he has wowed us with the wonders, including both the joys and sorrows, of seeing life through the eyes of a wild creature.  This DVD is beautifully filmed and leaves you with a greater respect and understanding of the wild mule deer...and of all animals we share this planet with for that matter.He spent years getting to know a herd of wild mule deer, day in and day out spending time with them, until finally he was accepted by the &#34;matriarch&#34; of the herd.  After this, he was no longer treated as a man, but as another mule deer...he was even groomed by the deer!  If another human came into view, these deer still shot off over the horizon and so they could not be considered tame by any means.  Yet, he was surprised to find that, after a while, they would even respond to his calling out the names he had given them.  He also witnessed their capacity for intense grief as one of the mother deer lost her fawn and his own grief at the dangers they are forced to deal with, both from other animals, from the weather, and from human hunters.Anyone who enjoys hunting should see this movie as it imparts a deeper sense of respect for animals and the feeling that we definitely should be honoring their sacrifice when they are killed.  For this movie shows that they can think and feel as much as any human being, even if different than us.I can't wait to see where this guy goes next...and what wild animal he will touch and give us a window into understanding.",5,A Definite Sense of Wonderment,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,1605,"['Having', 'seen', 'guy', 'raise', 'live', 'wild', 'turkeys', 'thought', 'would', 'love', 'attempt', 'do', 'same', 'mule', 'deer', 'Once', 'again', 'wowed', 'wonders', 'including', 'joys', 'sorrows', 'seeing', 'life', 'eyes', 'wild', 'creature', 'DVD', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'greater', 'respect', 'understanding', 'wild', 'mule', 'deer', 'animals', 'share', 'planet', 'matter.He', 'spent', 'years', 'getting', 'know', 'herd', 'wild', 'mule', 'deer', 'day', 'day', 'spending', 'time', 'finally', 'was', 'accepted', '34', 'matriarch', '34', 'herd', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'treated', 'man', 'mule', 'deer', 'was', 'even', 'groomed', 'deer', 'human', 'came', 'view', 'deer', 'still', 'shot', 'off', 'horizon', 'so', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'tame', 'means', 'Yet', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'while', 'would', 'even', 'respond', 'calling', 'out', 'names', 'had', 'given', 'also', 'witnessed', 'capacity', 'intense', 'grief', 'one', 'mother', 'deer', 'lost', 'fawn', 'own', 'grief', 'dangers', 'are', 'forced', 'deal', 'other', 'animals', 'weather', 'human', 'hunters.Anyone', 'who', 'hunting', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'deeper', 'sense', 'respect', 'animals', 'feeling', 'definitely', 'should', 'be', 'honoring', 'sacrifice', 'when', 'are', 'killed', 'movie', 'can', 'think', 'feel', 'as', 'much', 'human', 'being', 'even', 'different', 'us.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'where', 'guy', 'next', 'what', 'wild', 'animal', 'will', 'touch', 'give', 'window', 'understanding']",Nature: Touching the Wild - Living With Mule Deer

I identified with Jot Hutto and his experiences. He does a fine effort of telling his story. I agree with the reviewers that this is an excellent film--however--as it is said, the book is much better. The book goes into greater detail on the events which the video, for lack of time, has to omit or condense, e.g. the story of the hunters toward the end of the video. The cinematography is wonderful and was not expected. I wish it was on blue-ray.",5,A meaningful video,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,555,"['caught', 'book', 'library', 'new', 'book', 'section', 'read', 'first', 'realized', 'was', 'video', 'identified', 'Jot', 'Hutto', 'experiences', 'fine', 'effort', 'telling', 'story', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'excellent', 'film', 'however', 'said', 'book', 'much', 'better', 'book', 'greater', 'detail', 'events', 'video', 'lack', 'time', 'omit', 'condense', 'e.g', 'story', 'hunters', 'end', 'video', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'was', 'not', 'expected', 'wish', 'was', 'blue-ray']",Nature: Touching the Wild - Living With Mule Deer
1693866,A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP,B00IAR2DJG,NYFB,"[2, 2]","Joe Hutto has dedicated seven years of his life to becoming a wild mule deer. Ordinarily, the deer herd would run from any human, but these keenly intelligent animals come to regard this stranger as one of their own. As he crosses the species divide, Jo Hutto taps into a new understanding of these elusive animals. That was the technical description of this DVD but the emotional description of this DVD should be, if you taught you have experienced love, affection and trust in the same caliber as Jo Hutto, the truth would be you ain't seen nothing yet. Having wild animals to trust you in their own environment is a rare scene although I have seen few.The memories of this DVD will stay with you for long, long time.

1693867,A2GRDEM5D6OTCD,B00IAR2DJG,Richard Behmer,"[5, 6]","This is a remarkable nature study film that left me in awe the first time I viewed it on PBS. How marvelous it must have been to experience walking amongst these beautiful creatures and learning how to not only communicate with them, but also to actually become one of their family!  It was heartbreaking to see how one of these wonderful Mule Deer was taken by a hunter's bullet after braving SO many struggles and challenges within nature herself, only to fall prey to man too early in life. When he was interviewed, the hunter asked the author here how old the deer might have been. The author knew exactly, having lived with and helping to raise the deer from birth. I believe this incident caused the author to give up his project because of the pain it caused him to see any of his adopted family dying such a terrible death. To those hunters who try and justify their killings by saying how many days or years they have tried to shoot one of these and that they will enjoy the meat, you are grossly wrong. With all the special equipment and tricks, plus high powered rifles with high powered scopes, it's not a sport at all; it's a killing spree. Why does a wild animal have to give up it's life so that you can brag about the kill and eat the meat? You aren't hungry and you aren't starving, so it cannot be justified any more than those that shot and killed all of the buffalo strictly for fun and sport, almost wiping out the entire species.",5,Extraordinary Film,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,1451,"['remarkable', 'nature', 'study', 'film', 'left', 'awe', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'PBS', 'How', 'marvelous', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'experience', 'walking', 'beautiful', 'creatures', 'learning', 'how', 'not', 'only', 'communicate', 'also', 'actually', 'become', 'one', 'family', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'how', 'one', 'wonderful', 'Mule', 'Deer', 'was', 'taken', 'hunter', 'bullet', 'braving', 'SO', 'many', 'struggles', 'challenges', 'nature', 'only', 'fall', 'prey', 'man', 'too', 'early', 'life', 'When', 'was', 'interviewed', 'hunter', 'asked', 'author', 'here', 'how', 'old', 'deer', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'author', 'knew', 'exactly', 'having', 'lived', 'helping', 'raise', 'deer', 'birth', 'believe', 'incident', 'caused', 'author', 'give', 'up', 'project', 'pain', 'caused', 'see', 'adopted', 'family', 'dying', 'such', 'terrible', 'death', 'hunters', 'who', 'try', 'justify', 'killings', 'saying', 'how', 'many', 'days', 'years', 'have', 'tried', 'shoot', 'one', 'will', 'enjoy', 'meat', 'are', 'grossly', 'wrong', 'special', 'equipment', 'tricks', 'high', 'powered', 'rifles', 'high', 'powered', 'scopes', 'not', 'sport', 'killing', 'spree', 'Why', 'wild', 'animal', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'so', 'can', 'brag', 'kill', 'eat', 'meat', 'are', ""n't"", 'hungry', 'are', ""n't"", 'starving', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'justified', 'more', 'shot', 'killed', 'buffalo', 'strictly', 'fun', 'sport', 'almost', 'wiping', 'out', 'entire', 'species']",Nature: Touching the Wild - Living With Mule Deer
