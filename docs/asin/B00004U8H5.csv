At first I thought it was too slow and easy for me to get a good workout (I had to workout during my pregnancy because I had gained a lot of weight and didn't want to become unhealthy).  This will not lead you to break a huge sweat but especially during pregnancy you need to prepare your body for labor and help keep aches and pains at bay. For example, you will get leg cramps and this will help stretch out your calves and hamstrings. My right groin muscle start to pull doing my last trimester and this helped stretch it. It is calming, relaxing, and it gets you through basic movements that will give you some muscle tone and keep you limber or increase your flexibility. Even though your are inhibited by your growing belly, you still need to maintain your flexibility and muscle tone and this video will help. It also helps you to forget about all your worries and just meditate a little each day. Especially the last trimester as you start to taper off your exercise, this video is great to do. And for those women who are afraid of miscarriage, this video is light enough to not be a concern at all. It is so safe. In fact I was able to do all the movements of the lady in the video in her second trimester all through til the end. And my non pregnant friends who were new to yoga loved the video because it was challenging enough but slow enough to be able to.follow and the moves weren't too complicated. It also has good core exercises like planks and all fours exercises that help you to keep your core, arms, and pecs strong. Oddly, there are not many downward dogs in this. I was told by my Pilates instructor that downward dog was a great pregnancy stretch but Shiva doesn't have much of it here. She has a short modified one. I guess some people feel the baby being upside down (or right side up) is not good for the baby? See? Shiva is really careful in this video.

The stretches are good and very appropriate for pregnancy.  Before becoming pregnant, I attained a fairly advanced level.  I stopped practicing around 9 wks because of &quot;all day sickness&quot;.  I'm just picking up again in the third trimester.  I had no trouble following the video and getting back into it.  I liked the 3 different models showing different modifications.  I didn't like that each model was specifically for a trimester.  I wish it took more of a &quot;do what feels right&quot; approach.  Many of us can still do most of the postures with no or small modifications.  The tape assumes in trimester 3, all you can do is sit in a chair and put your arm or leg out.  The relaxation at the end is fantastic.  The modifications here are completely appropriate to enhance circulation for each trimester.  All in all, it's a good pregnancy workout.

551946,A1PQK9OTGHDY08,B00004U8H5,Ana_y_lat,"[2, 2]","I just tried this workout for the first time.  I did yoga for a couple of years, wasn't spectacular at it, but not too bad either, but since I used to take classes at my school, I would have summers off, so I am pretty stiff now.  I have to say it's my first prenatal yoga DVD, so I don't know how it fares if compared to other DVDs.  Although I liked it, there are a few problems:1.  At the beginning cueing doesn't seem to go with action in quite a few places, which was quite annoying - I'd do the exercise at the pace of her voice and then would glimpse at the screen to see the people on DVD completely out of sync with me, which threw me off.  It sort of persists throughout the DVD (the cue might be to lift arms, while they're still finishing up the previous pose), although not quite so bad.2.  I feel like some poses, even those designed for the first trimester, were way too modified and way too easy (mind you, I'm very stiff and out of practice right now).  I think that once and if I get back to the shape I used to be in, I might just do some regular yoga with modifications to accomodate my changing body (plus, I simply fear that once I do this video a few times, it'll become too easy).(I'm revising this review a couple of months later, I'm 5 months pregnant now, and I have to say, it is much harder to do some parts of the routine (just 2 or 3 poses) now than it was at 3 months, so maybe I underestimated the intensity a little, but I also have to admit, I have not been doing this regularly at all, so I am not only getting more pregnant, but also more stiff, which could have something to do with the level of difficulty I now experience as well).3.  I also would have liked a slightly longer practice (or choices of shorter ones) and more flow, rather than just a series of postures.4.  Some of the things she's saying sound a little ""new-agy"" to me, and annoy me rather than help.To address some issues brought up by other reviewers, I didn't mind her voice so much (although I couldn't help to notice that she doesn't pronounce the ""h"" in exhale and for some reason I got fixated on that), and I thought her directions were pretty good and not annoying.  I also didn't mind the music at all - it is a good background without being overpowering and annoying.I also was quite glad to have kegels incorporated into the workout simply because them being relatively easy to do, I tend to forget to do them at all, so it's nice to have time set aside in a workout just for those.Overall, a good DVD, a great one for those who want a pretty gentle workout/stretching routine, but not so perfect for those of us who rely on yoga to keep us fit, especially those who are in shape as they begin it.",3,"Good workout, some problems",1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,2715,"['just', 'tried', 'workout', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'yoga', 'couple', 'years', 'was', ""n't"", 'spectacular', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'used', 'take', 'classes', 'school', 'would', 'have', 'summers', 'off', 'am', 'pretty', 'stiff', 'now', 'have', 'say', 'first', 'prenatal', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'compared', 'other', 'DVDs', 'liked', 'are', 'few', 'problems:1', 'beginning', 'cueing', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'action', 'quite', 'few', 'places', 'was', 'quite', 'annoying', ""'d"", 'do', 'exercise', 'pace', 'voice', 'then', 'would', 'glimpse', 'screen', 'see', 'people', 'DVD', 'completely', 'sync', 'threw', 'off', 'sort', 'persists', 'DVD', 'cue', 'might', 'be', 'lift', 'arms', ""'re"", 'still', 'finishing', 'up', 'previous', 'pose', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'bad.2', 'feel', 'poses', 'even', 'designed', 'first', 'trimester', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'modified', 'way', 'too', 'easy', ""'m"", 'very', 'stiff', 'practice', 'right', 'now', 'think', 'once', 'get', 'back', 'shape', 'used', 'be', 'might', 'just', 'do', 'regular', 'yoga', 'modifications', 'accomodate', 'changing', 'body', 'simply', 'fear', 'once', 'do', 'video', 'few', 'times', ""'ll"", 'become', 'too', 'easy', ""'m"", 'revising', 'review', 'couple', 'months', 'later', ""'m"", '5', 'months', 'pregnant', 'now', 'have', 'say', 'much', 'harder', 'do', 'parts', 'routine', 'just', '2', '3', 'poses', 'now', 'was', '3', 'months', 'maybe', 'underestimated', 'intensity', 'little', 'also', 'have', 'admit', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'doing', 'regularly', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'getting', 'more', 'pregnant', 'also', 'more', 'stiff', 'could', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'level', 'difficulty', 'now', 'experience', 'as', 'well', '.3', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'slightly', 'longer', 'practice', 'choices', 'shorter', 'ones', 'more', 'flow', 'rather', 'just', 'series', 'postures.4', 'things', 'saying', 'sound', 'little', 'new-agy', 'annoy', 'rather', 'help.To', 'address', 'issues', 'brought', 'up', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'voice', 'so', 'much', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', ""n't"", 'pronounce', 'h', 'exhale', 'reason', 'got', 'fixated', 'thought', 'directions', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'annoying', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'music', 'good', 'background', 'being', 'overpowering', 'annoying.I', 'also', 'was', 'quite', 'glad', 'have', 'kegels', 'incorporated', 'workout', 'simply', 'being', 'relatively', 'easy', 'do', 'tend', 'forget', 'do', 'nice', 'have', 'time', 'set', 'aside', 'workout', 'just', 'those.Overall', 'good', 'DVD', 'great', 'one', 'who', 'want', 'pretty', 'gentle', 'workout/stretching', 'routine', 'not', 'so', 'perfect', 'who', 'rely', 'yoga', 'keep', 'fit', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'shape', 'begin']",Yoga Journal's Prenatal Yoga VHS

I liked it, but I still think that Rocki's Prenatal Yoga is more my style.This video has three women doing it (with Sheva doing a voice over for all). Sheva does the first trimester variations, and one women does second trimester, and the other does third trimester. It uses a chair, block, a strap, and a blanket (and your mat).There are three sections, each about 20 minutes each. You could do them separately if you wanted to.The workout starts with a Warm-up. I found it to be a bit too fast in some poses, it didn't really let me get into something before moving onto the next thing. This is a recurring problem throughout the workout, I thought. But, it was a good warm-up.Next came Standing work. Again, I just think that Rocki tends to get it more. I feel like I am getting a better workout with her. BUT - some of the poses are different and good in that way. I did find that some of the ""variations"" specified for the second trimester were too easy for me, so I did them unmodified. And I am almost in my third trimester! The third trimester variations seemed really easy. I don't know how much my flexibility etc will change in another few weeks, but I don't see it diminishing THAT much. Maybe when I am nearer to the end...The Floor Work was also good, but again, not as good as Rocki. Shiva skips doing a real downward dog, and instead uses a chair. I don't know, but the downward dog I do with Rocki's routine feels sooooo good. I missed it. And the way that Shiva modifies child's pose made it feel not as good, either.There is also a short meditation at the end. A bit too short. I don't really normally DO the meditation bits, but I think anyone who did would find this too short.Shiva also only does a really short bit of kegels, whereas Rocki does them throughout the workout.SO - I guess what I am saying is that I will just stick with Rocki, unless somehow I get seriously bored with her, although maybe doing one of the sections on this video might be nice if I am short on time and still want to do some yoga.",3,"OK, I guess, but I like Rocki's Prenatal Yoga much more",1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,2155,"['sister', 'gave', 'GAIAM', 'Prenatal', 'Yoga', 'Sheva', 'Rea', 'video', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'dvd..', 'video', 'nice', 'too', 'liked', 'still', 'think', 'Rocki', 'Prenatal', 'Yoga', 'more', 'style.This', 'video', 'three', 'women', 'doing', 'Sheva', 'doing', 'voice', 'Sheva', 'first', 'trimester', 'variations', 'one', 'women', 'second', 'trimester', 'other', 'third', 'trimester', 'chair', 'block', 'strap', 'blanket', 'mat', 'are', 'three', 'sections', '20', 'minutes', 'could', 'do', 'separately', 'wanted', 'to.The', 'workout', 'Warm-up', 'found', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'fast', 'poses', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'let', 'get', 'something', 'moving', 'next', 'thing', 'recurring', 'problem', 'workout', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'warm-up.Next', 'came', 'Standing', 'work', 'Again', 'just', 'think', 'Rocki', 'get', 'more', 'feel', 'am', 'getting', 'better', 'workout', 'BUT', 'poses', 'are', 'different', 'good', 'way', 'did', 'find', 'variations', 'specified', 'second', 'trimester', 'were', 'too', 'easy', 'so', 'did', 'unmodified', 'am', 'almost', 'third', 'trimester', 'third', 'trimester', 'variations', 'seemed', 'really', 'easy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'flexibility', 'etc', 'will', 'change', 'few', 'weeks', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'diminishing', 'much', 'Maybe', 'when', 'am', 'nearer', 'end', 'Floor', 'Work', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'again', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Rocki', 'Shiva', 'doing', 'real', 'downward', 'dog', 'instead', 'chair', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'downward', 'dog', 'do', 'Rocki', 'routine', 'feels', 'sooooo', 'good', 'missed', 'way', 'Shiva', 'child', 'pose', 'made', 'feel', 'not', 'good', 'also', 'short', 'meditation', 'end', 'bit', 'too', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'normally', 'DO', 'meditation', 'bits', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'did', 'would', 'find', 'too', 'short.Shiva', 'also', 'only', 'really', 'short', 'bit', 'kegels', 'whereas', 'Rocki', 'workout.SO', 'guess', 'what', 'am', 'saying', 'will', 'just', 'stick', 'Rocki', 'somehow', 'get', 'seriously', 'bored', 'maybe', 'doing', 'one', 'sections', 'video', 'might', 'be', 'nice', 'am', 'short', 'time', 'still', 'want', 'do', 'yoga']",Yoga Journal's Prenatal Yoga VHS

Morris ""Backroads""","[0, 0]","Being fairly new to the whole pregnancy deal and still something of an amateur in regards to yoga, I've been trying to find a good DVD that's comparable to my non-pregnant yoga workouts  and will get me through the next months.  This one seems to fit the bill.  The workout is fairly mild (no perky extreme yogi mamas here) but with careful focus on solid poses that encourage precision in the pose.  The workout covers a good range--floor, standing, meditation, even a pelvic floor workout.  While I have to agree with other reviewers who felt Shiva moved through poses a little too quickly (lately I've been trying to work on holding my poses in my own makeshift practices) I feel she encouraged focus on getting each pose just right.  The whole practice is very relaxing--my first impression was of a workout and teacher a little too holistic and hokey, but after about ten minutes I really found myself peaceful and engaged.  Beyond the cramming of the poses, my only other complain was the setup of the DVD.  Shiva encouraged a build-up to the whole workout, but unless one wants to skip through the DVD and hope to get the player to stop at the right moments, one sort of has to watch the whole thing. Which isn't necessarily bad, but a scene selection option would have been nice.  But overall I am quite fond of this workout.

Do I feel that this helped with child birth...no, but it help through the uncomfortable portions of pregnancy, especially through the hot days of summer. Her focus is on staying healthy for the baby. There is never any reference doing yoga now to get back into pants latter. This should be how all prenatal exercises programs should be! Sadly, so many tell us how we should look based on the medias distorted representation of body image.  But I guess that it what sells. Do this work out for yourself! Continue to do Yoga after your pregnancy is over, because it will help your body recuperate. Do not go crazy with your postpartum weight loss, it is not good for you and not realistic.

I used this DVD regularly, as well as Karyne Steben's ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" (strength building and more challenging). I also continued to lift weights into my 7th month and walked about 3 times a week up to the 40 week mark.This workout provides both the relaxation and strength building benefits of yoga (I especially feel the results of the squats in my legs). It also helped me relieve tension and pain in my lower back. Women from each trimester demonstrate modifications of the workout, which is broken up into meditation and pranayama, standing poses, floor work, and guided relaxation. I enjoyed the soothing music and Shiva Rea's calming tone. I also own Crunch's Yoga Mama, which is also relaxing and relieves back pain but does not leave me feeling I actually exercised.

I just wanted to update to inform anyone considering this video, that after having my son, I went back to my pre-baby size!  I worked out diligently 5 days a week, once a day (sometimes twice a day) and I ate right... well, MOST of the time! ;)  This video and the other video I talk about in the following review were SERIOUSLY the best purchases I made during pregnancy.**Now, feel free to continue for more information:I do NOT understand how I went through my first pregnancy without this video!!  Whilst pregnant with my first daughter, I worked out very little, making losing the after baby weight THAT much more difficult.  I made the decision once I finally DID lose the weight that with the next pregnancy, I would not make a stupid choice like that again.I did weeks of research before I finally chose two videos:  Fit Mama with Leisa Hart and PRENATAL YOGA WITH SHIVA RAE.  I wanted to make sure that wherever I spent my money, that I would not regret the purchase.  I read and re-read reviews written by other mommies and mommies-to-be who had used these videos and 99% of what I read was positive, so I ordered and hoped for the best.From the first moment that I did Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rae, I was in LOVE!  I did not order until my second trimester (money issues prevented ordering earlier) but I wanted to work out no matter what and no matter how far along I was.This video has become a staple in my daily routine.  No matter if I have to wake up early, stay up late or do it during my daughter's nap time, I do it religiously!  Five days a week once a day and even sometimes twice a day.There are days that I do not have time to do it and I am so bummed to have missed it!  When my body feels as though every muscle, ligament and joint is out to get me, I turn on this video and by the end of the tape, I feel normal again (well, as normal as any pregnant woman can feel)!A total plus to this video is that it is perfect for my two and a half year old to do along with me.  The intensity level is made for pregnant women (who should not be trying to be Billy Blanks, Tae Bo Master) so my daughter can join in on the activity (as much as her toddler coordination will allow) and I can have my workout.I truly, highly recommend this video for any pregnant woman in any trimester at any level of fitness.

A former runner and elliptical-trainer enthusiast, I am used to a workout that makes you sweat buckets and finish feeling spent.  This was a very new experience for me.Yoga was recommended to me by my doula. I was interested because I've never been a flexible person and I wanted desperately to exercise throughout my pregnancy.  Yoga is ideal because it can be modified as your progress and it teaches you to relax, breathe, and move deliberately with control.  Every morning, when I've finished this workout, I feel so loose and relaxed, like I could &quot;slip down the drain.&quot;  I also feel more confident as my due date approaches that I will successfully birth my baby without any medication.  I am learning how to open up my pelvis, strengthen my pelvic floor, and RELAX AND BREATHE.  While pregnant you have 40 weeks (give or take a few) to prepare for the hardest (and most rewarding) work you'll ever do.  Make the most of it!This video was designed with your choice of three people to follow--one for each trimester.  Many modifications are suggested and modeled so no matter what your current state of fitness, you will find stretches and poses to do.You will be plagued by aches and pains and restless nights if you don't take care of your body while you're pregnant.

I felt frustrated with the New Method DVD because I could tell how much flexibility I was losing, and it was NOTHING like the yoga classes I had taken every week for the past couple of years, but it was free, fun, and fit in well with my cardio and strength routine, so I just went with it.I decided to purchase Prental Yoga with Shiva Rea, and based on previous reviews, I was skeptical that it would be challenging enough for me. But I LOVE it! It's the same sort of hatha-oriented poses I am accustomed to. Most importantly for me, it requires you to ""hold the pose"" as opposed to doing vinyasa or ashtanga-style ""flows"" like with The New Method. For me personally, holding a stretch for a good long time and really breathing through it is the only way to really increase/maintain my flexibility.Shiva's voice is soothing (although some of her pronunciation can be a little distracting), the modifications are mostly appropriate (I still do some poses the second trimester way even though I'm in my third trimester now), and I feel GREAT when it's over.

First off, the video is very much of the hippie, cheesy yoga-zen side, which in itself isn't a deal breaker.  The actual yoga in the video is pretty good - it's nice and thorough and really stretches every part out, unlike some of the other yoga videos out there.  What I don't like about it is that it is about 53 minutes long and you can't really do specific chapters so you have to do the entire thing.  I don't always have 50 minutes to do yoga everyday and I would like to do just hip openers or standing poses or something, but the video doesn't let you select.  (I am using the previous version of this video, so it's possible they have fixed this.)I much prefer Crunch Yoga Mama, even though it's a little dated or Krystel Eykel's Yoga Journal prenatal video.  The Crunch one is really through and only 35 minutes and the Krystel Eykel one has a few chapters for energizing and relaxing sequences that you can do separately (they are about 30 mins and 17 mins) or together for a longer workout.Overall, I would give this one a pass and try one of the other ones.  Also, they wear these ridiculous one-piece unitards in this, which is completely silly.  I can't imagine wearing that if I was pregnant.

551981,A1T6WFITCNBER7,B00004U8H5,ohiomom23,"[1, 1]","I checked a few DVDs out of our library to see if I could find one that I would want to use through my whole pregnancy. Side note: I also watched the video &#34;Yoga Journal and Lamaze present: Yoga for your pregnancy with Kristen Eykel&#34; (it seemed to have quite a bit of promotional material where I wanted yoga and I didn't like the jarring motion of many of the moves) and &#34;Yoga for Pregnancy, Labor & Birth Starring Colette Crawford&#34; (which seemed like they locked two pregnant women in a small windowless room to do yoga with a creepy older lady). I've read positive reviews of each, so maybe they just weren't my style, but I didn't get what I wanted out of them. What I was looking for was something to help me relax and focus on myself and my body. I wanted calm, easy movements, with a few challenging moves to push me just a little further. My yoga goal is centered relaxation and control of my body for delivery. In that regard, this video is great. It is gentle and quiet, and her voice is very... I don't want to say monotonous, but I think that may be the best word. But I like that the whole video is hypnotically peaceful since it helps put me in the yoga headspace. If you're looking for a workout, this is not the video for you, since there is only a small portion of the video (the planks) that I find difficult, and I am not in great shape. There are other sections where I can push myself a little further, but that is the only section where I feel like it's a real workout. I do like that each section is focused on the muscles and positions that will help with delivery, and I love that they include Kegels.I have a two-year-old, so it took me about three viewings to get through the whole video uninterrupted (it's a full hour long). I do wish you could jump to the cuts between sections (sitting, standing, relaxation, etc) but there is no menu for that and scene jumping on the remote puts you randomly in the middle of the section. I just wrote down what the time was for each break so I can fast-forward when I don't have time for the whole thing. I also paused a lot to spend more time on some sections and less on others, but over time I realized the video comes back to the same areas a few times, so if you don't feel like you got enough of a stretch, you'll probably get that muscle again later. Oh, and there are a few places where the directions she says are not what the actors do, so it took me a few viewings to not mess up at those parts.All that being said, I do find that this video leaves me feeling relaxed, centered, and more in control of my body.

(didn't workout during first trimester--too nauseous)  THIS YOGA ROUTINE ROCKS!Shiva Rea is a great yoga instructor anyway, but she's been pregnant (says in her interview she gained 50 pounds while pregnant), and she is dead on with these poses.  She knows exactly what you need to stretch and strengthen, so there are lots of poses that help loosen up your back, hips, and pelivs, strengthen your pelvic floor (squats and kegels), and get all those tired, achy muscles.The workout is in three segments plus a cooldown that is the pregnant lady's equivalent for savasana (corpse pose), and is very relaxing.  Each segment is about 15 minutes, so I find it easy to do one, two, or all three, depending on how much time/energy I have.  I love that!She has two other exercisers with her, so there is someone demonstrating poses for each trimester (and they are definitely in their 2nd and 3rd trimester!), and the modifications allow you to get the benefit of the pose without overdoing it.  The music and instruction are soothing and peaceful.Sometimes I do this as my main workout, other times this is my ""before bed"" stretch-out session.  My whole body feels better after I do this workout, like I've had a massage.  In fact, I do part of this workout before getting a massage, and the massage is more effective.I feel this workout, along with regular chiropractic adjustments, has eliminated the headaches and back problems I was experiencing, and I certainly feel a lot better in general than my pregnant friends who are not using it.Bottom line:  This is an outstanding yoga practice for pregnant women, and I would highly recommend it as a regular part of your workout routine!",5,Wouldn't want to be pregnant without it,1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,1848,"['have', 'used', 'video', 'Perfect', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'Karyne', 'Steben', 'Pilates', 'Pregnancy', 'Niece', 'Pecenka', 'start', 'second', 'trimester', 'did', ""n't"", 'workout', 'first', 'trimester', 'too', 'nauseous', 'THIS', 'YOGA', 'ROUTINE', 'ROCKS', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'great', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'anyway', 'been', 'pregnant', 'interview', 'gained', '50', 'pounds', 'pregnant', 'dead', 'poses', 'exactly', 'what', 'need', 'stretch', 'strengthen', 'are', 'lots', 'poses', 'help', 'loosen', 'up', 'back', 'hips', 'pelivs', 'strengthen', 'pelvic', 'floor', 'squats', 'kegels', 'get', 'tired', 'muscles.The', 'workout', 'three', 'segments', 'cooldown', 'pregnant', 'lady', 'equivalent', 'savasana', 'corpse', 'pose', 'very', 'relaxing', 'segment', '15', 'minutes', 'find', 'easy', 'do', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'depending', 'how', 'much', 'time/energy', 'have', 'love', 'two', 'other', 'exercisers', 'someone', 'demonstrating', 'poses', 'trimester', 'are', 'definitely', '2nd', '3rd', 'trimester', 'modifications', 'allow', 'get', 'benefit', 'pose', 'overdoing', 'music', 'instruction', 'are', 'soothing', 'peaceful.Sometimes', 'do', 'main', 'workout', 'other', 'times', 'bed', 'stretch-out', 'session', 'whole', 'body', 'feels', 'better', 'do', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'had', 'massage', 'fact', 'do', 'part', 'workout', 'getting', 'massage', 'massage', 'more', 'effective.I', 'feel', 'workout', 'regular', 'chiropractic', 'adjustments', 'eliminated', 'headaches', 'back', 'problems', 'was', 'experiencing', 'certainly', 'feel', 'lot', 'better', 'general', 'pregnant', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'using', 'it.Bottom', 'line', 'outstanding', 'yoga', 'practice', 'pregnant', 'women', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'regular', 'part', 'workout', 'routine']",Yoga Journal's Prenatal Yoga VHS
