The 3 main characters (male emergency response employee , female doctor and her daughter) have distinct personalities and are presented initially in a humorous manner.  There was very good chemistry between the main characters and the overall acting in the film was very good. The outbreak of the flu and subsequent quarantine of the people is presented fairly realistically with a horror element to it.  The second half of the film falls into a more predictable pattern with a lot of action sequences, good guy/bad guy confrontations and political in-fighting.Overall a very good movie with humor, horror, action, politics and a romantic angle all mixed in.The audio options on the DVD include both Korean (w/ English subtitles) and English (Dubbed).

It was entertaining, had a good plot, action packed, filled with drama, suspense, love, as well as the usual scientific themes and end of the world scenarios. *semi spoiler alert* It had a touch of the corny big shot authorities challenging one another as well as the little girl getting lost and both kang and kim search for her. This happened 3 times where she was left alone lost and both of them searching for her as we the viewers are supposed to be torn in our emotions every which way as our hearts go out to a young sick/ girl looking for her mommy. All in all it was better than most epidemic films I have seen and foreign films do not cease to amaze me in terms of substance, QUALITY, I WILL SAY QUALITY AGAIN because it deserves to be said twice, and also being down to earth human emotion it invokes. The difference between Hollywood movies is it tries to focus on action and throwing money at big picture and special effects and loses it's way in plot and connecting with the viewer. Foreign films such as this capture a beautiful romance in connecting with the viewer in a realistic touching , heartfelt way. I appreciate foreign films such as these and hopefully more will follow.

The story is told through the eyes of a young, attractive, female doctor Kim In-hae (Soo Ae) and her young daughter; and an Emergency Response Team, man called Jigu (Hyuk Jang) - they meet after a car crash and he sort of falls for her, oh and he's good looking too, but you had guessed that.As the contagion spreads things get ever more desperate and as is essential in these types of films we have to find a cure and turn it into a vaccine and the clock is ticking. As is always de rigueur for epidemic films, we have the authorities being spectacularly wrong and putting profit before people and we also get a load of action, explosions and even shooting. This is what Korea does best, a great big emotional roller coaster with clich&eacute;s and coincidences by the truck load- sorry exploding truck load. It is over whelmingly sentimental and wears its plot holes proudly on its sleeve. We have the comic asides too that is often a feature of Korean cinema. There is a cast of thousands and the twists keep coming right till the end. If you like Korean cinema you will love this, if you want some serious, thoughtful and original cinema then this is probably not for you. I really loved it but it has its `issues' hence my rating, but I could watch it again and still enjoy it - recommended.",4,"Korean, Epidemic Actioner",1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,2104,"['Yes', 'Korean', 'outbreak', 'nasty', 'flu', 'sort', 'numbers', 'letters', 'HN5D1', 'something', 'know', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'bad', 'What', 'group', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'trafficked', 'shipping', 'container', 'get', 'infected', 'arrival', 'Bundang', 'just', 'few', 'miles', 'Seoul', 'opened', 'one', 'traffickers', 'foot', 'soldiers', 'infected', 'only', 'one', 'survivor', 'quite', 'sensibly', 'runner', 'Said', 'trafficker', 'then', 'cough', 'sneezathon', 'city.Then', 'as', 'little', '36', 'hours', 'virus', 'spread', 'incubation', 'period', 'cold', 'symptoms', 'early', 'stages', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'deal', 'then', 'people', 'start', 'dying', 'authorities', 'are', 'very', 'soon', 'overwhelmed', 'drastic', 'measures', 'are', 'taken', 'contain', 'outbreak', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'young', 'attractive', 'female', 'doctor', 'Kim', 'In-hae', 'Soo', 'Ae', 'young', 'daughter', 'Emergency', 'Response', 'Team', 'man', 'called', 'Jigu', 'Hyuk', 'Jang', 'meet', 'car', 'crash', 'sort', 'falls', 'oh', 'good', 'looking', 'too', 'had', 'guessed', 'contagion', 'things', 'get', 'ever', 'more', 'desperate', 'essential', 'types', 'films', 'have', 'find', 'cure', 'turn', 'vaccine', 'clock', 'ticking', 'always', 'de', 'rigueur', 'epidemic', 'films', 'have', 'authorities', 'being', 'spectacularly', 'wrong', 'putting', 'profit', 'people', 'also', 'get', 'load', 'action', 'explosions', 'even', 'shooting', 'what', 'Korea', 'best', 'great', 'big', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'clich', 'eacute', 'coincidences', 'truck', 'load-', 'sorry', 'exploding', 'truck', 'load', 'whelmingly', 'sentimental', 'plot', 'holes', 'proudly', 'sleeve', 'have', 'comic', 'asides', 'too', 'often', 'feature', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'cast', 'thousands', 'twists', 'keep', 'coming', 'right', 'till', 'end', 'like', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'will', 'love', 'want', 'serious', 'thoughtful', 'original', 'cinema', 'then', 'probably', 'not', 'really', 'loved', 'issues', 'hence', 'rating', 'could', 'watch', 'again', 'still', 'enjoy', 'recommended']",Flu

People&#8217;s only hope of survival rests on the shoulders of one unexpected person. This is a familiar formula for action movies involving natural disasters, but South Korean movie &#8220;The Flu&#8221; (&#8220;Gamgi&#8221;) makes an effective use of it, and the result is a pretty entertaining action movie with some emotional moments.The film&#8217;s main characters are Kang Ji-goo (Jang Hyuk), a good-natured rescue worker who gets acquainted with a single mother Kim In-hae (Soo Ae) and her adorable daughter Kim Mi-reu (Park Min-ha). As the panic spreads in the area (which happens to be close to Seoul, capital of the country), military forces step in. Kang Ji-goo and Kim In-hae are ready to do anything &#8211; I mean anything &#8211; to save the life of the little girl and other citizens.The film&#8217;s premise of pandemic may remind us of such films as &#8220;Contagion&#8221; and &#8220;Outbreak,&#8221; but director Sung-su Kim (&#8220;Musa&#8221;) puts emphasis on dramatic relationships between the characters. As a result, &#8220;The Flu&#8221; especially its second half gets very emotional and intense, if not totally scientifically convincing.You may spot countless plot holes and incredible coincidences, but with fine performances from the cast, &#8220;The Flu&#8221; is an engrossing ride.",4,(3.5 STARS) Korean Pandemic Action Thriller: Very Emotional and Intense,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,1429,"['Outbreak', 'deadly', 'strain', 'bird', 'flu', 'residential', 'area', 'Bundang', 'district', 'Seongnam', 'city', 'panic', 'People', '8217', 'only', 'hope', 'survival', 'rests', 'shoulders', 'one', 'unexpected', 'person', 'familiar', 'formula', 'action', 'movies', 'involving', 'natural', 'disasters', 'South', 'Korean', 'movie', '8220', 'Flu', '8221', '8220', 'Gamgi', '8221', 'effective', 'use', 'result', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'action', 'movie', 'emotional', 'moments.The', 'film', '8217', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Kang', 'Ji-goo', 'Jang', 'Hyuk', 'good-natured', 'rescue', 'worker', 'who', 'acquainted', 'single', 'mother', 'Kim', 'In-hae', 'Soo', 'Ae', 'adorable', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Mi-reu', 'Park', 'Min-ha', 'panic', 'spreads', 'area', 'be', 'close', 'Seoul', 'capital', 'country', 'military', 'forces', 'step', 'Kang', 'Ji-goo', 'Kim', 'In-hae', 'are', 'ready', 'do', 'anything', '8211', 'mean', 'anything', '8211', 'save', 'life', 'little', 'girl', 'other', 'citizens.The', 'film', '8217', 's', 'premise', 'pandemic', 'may', 'remind', 'such', 'films', '8220', 'Contagion', '8221', '8220', 'Outbreak', '8221', 'director', 'Sung-su', 'Kim', '8220', 'Musa', '8221', 'emphasis', 'dramatic', 'relationships', 'characters', 'result', '8220', 'Flu', '8221', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'very', 'emotional', 'intense', 'not', 'totally', 'scientifically', 'convincing.You', 'may', 'spot', 'countless', 'plot', 'holes', 'incredible', 'coincidences', 'fine', 'performances', 'cast', '8220', 'Flu', '8221', 'engrossing', 'ride']",Flu

It was the story line itself.If Hollywood put out such a film it would not be shown in theaters here. It might even be banned. I just can't see them doing it.  It's far too realistic as to what would probably REALLY happen in such a situation. Hollywood continues to promote American government propaganda. They are generally always portrayed as kind and benevolent, taking care of the citizens, in the disaster movies. Even when they all save themselves and leave the citizens to suffer the disaster, they still try to save some. And they're generally good hearted, moral real people.Here we see what happens when hell breaks loose and you have tiers of command.This EMT guy was unbelievable, though.

While the actors aren't as well known, and the budget isn't quite Hollywood, the film showed thoughtful treatment and pacing of a viral pandemic unleashed in a suburb of Seoul. The cover art teaser depicts a bit more degradation then we actually see in the movie, but the cinematography and effects were fine. This is not a movie of huge explosions, but of society grinding to a halt and being overwhelmed by disease. However, where this film shines, is the acting between the two leads - Soo Ae as the single mother/doctor and Hyuk Jang as the Emergency Response Team member. Their personal story of survival and a simmering passive/aggressive romance grabs your attention, and holds it throughout the movie. You care about these characters and want to see their outcome. Yet, their story is integral to the main plot, as they are embroiled in the race to find patient zero who may have immunity to the disease. I would also like to compliment the child actress who played Soo Ae's daughter - she did a terrific job.The Korean background made for a pleasant change, and offered scenery, politics, and cultural differences that enhanced the film's story. For example, the quarantine situation and conditions might not be as believable if it were America. Part of me feels the shooting and rioting would have started far sooner... with the streets being more of a nightmare. Here, the only guns shown are in the hands of the military/police. For some, this might take away from the movie, but for me, it was the interaction between the characters that made it worthy. Of course, for those seeking action, there is still plenty of pandemic violence, and gore effects from the disease, just not what I would call on a Hollywood scale.The movie uses English sub-titles, and I didn't find them distracting.Parental Guidance: There is no nudity, and the language is fine. However, as noted, you have disease gore, societal violence, disturbing mass grave depiction, and Soo Ae's daughter is constantly shown in dire circumstances, so all in this probably should be an &#34;R&#34; rating, though most older teens would be accustomed to these scenes from other pandemic movies.Overall, while &#34;Flu&#34; doesn't bring anything new to the genre, I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my foreign film rating scale.",4,"""Outbreak"" Korean-style - Enjoyable, Good Acting - Typical for Pandemic Genre fans.",1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,2382,"['34', 'Flu', '34', 'Korean', 'version', '34', 'Outbreak', '34', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'known', 'budget', ""n't"", 'quite', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'showed', 'thoughtful', 'treatment', 'pacing', 'viral', 'pandemic', 'unleashed', 'suburb', 'Seoul', 'cover', 'art', 'teaser', 'bit', 'more', 'degradation', 'then', 'actually', 'see', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'effects', 'were', 'fine', 'not', 'movie', 'huge', 'explosions', 'society', 'grinding', 'halt', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'disease', 'However', 'where', 'film', 'shines', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'Soo', 'Ae', 'single', 'mother/doctor', 'Hyuk', 'Jang', 'Emergency', 'Response', 'Team', 'member', 'personal', 'story', 'survival', 'simmering', 'passive/aggressive', 'romance', 'grabs', 'attention', 'movie', 'care', 'characters', 'want', 'see', 'outcome', 'story', 'integral', 'main', 'plot', 'are', 'embroiled', 'race', 'find', 'patient', 'zero', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'immunity', 'disease', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'compliment', 'child', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Soo', 'Ae', 'daughter', 'did', 'terrific', 'job.The', 'Korean', 'background', 'made', 'pleasant', 'change', 'offered', 'scenery', 'politics', 'cultural', 'differences', 'enhanced', 'film', 'story', 'example', 'quarantine', 'situation', 'conditions', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'believable', 'were', 'America', 'Part', 'shooting', 'rioting', 'would', 'have', 'started', 'far', 'sooner', 'streets', 'being', 'more', 'nightmare', 'Here', 'only', 'guns', 'shown', 'are', 'hands', 'military/police', 'might', 'take', 'away', 'movie', 'was', 'interaction', 'characters', 'made', 'worthy', 'course', 'seeking', 'action', 'still', 'plenty', 'pandemic', 'violence', 'gore', 'effects', 'disease', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'Hollywood', 'scale.The', 'movie', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'distracting.Parental', 'Guidance', 'nudity', 'language', 'fine', 'However', 'noted', 'have', 'disease', 'gore', 'societal', 'violence', 'disturbing', 'mass', 'grave', 'depiction', 'Soo', 'Ae', 'daughter', 'constantly', 'shown', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'all', 'probably', 'should', 'be', '34', 'R', '34', 'rating', 'most', 'older', 'teens', 'would', 'be', 'accustomed', 'scenes', 'other', 'pandemic', 'movies.Overall', '34', 'Flu', '34', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'genre', 'give', '4', '5', 'stars', 'foreign', 'film', 'rating', 'scale']",Flu
