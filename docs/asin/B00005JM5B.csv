Burchfield,"[11, 16]","I haven't read the comic book series this movie is based on but I sure hope it is better than this movie was.If you remember the TV ads for it you've seen the best bits and that isn't much of an exaggeration. Sean Connery was good but most of the others were just sort of there to take up space.The idea of taking characters from several works of 19th century fiction never really works very well and could often have been better developed. Tom Sawyer, U.S. Secret Service, how'd that happen?, we don't get a clue. Mina Harker, Vampire, widow of one of the men who fought Dracula, never a clue as to how she isn't evil or can survive in sunlight, doesn't seem to need to feed very often either.The best sets were the club/hotel(?)in Africa where Quatermain is recruited to the League and a couple of libraries in London, all either blown or shot up. Nemo's submarine looked as big as an aircraft carrier in some ways but also like it was razor thin, certainly bigger on the inside than the outside.I kind of liked  the tank raid evil whatever his name was did on the Bank of England, a bit ahead of it's time but mostly looked OK. Nemo's 1930's style car was really pushing things for 1899, too much for me as what cars there were looked like (and were)horseless carriages. One of the most ridiculous bits was the League's journey from London to Venice. First you have this huge razor thin submarine rising up in the Thames (which is probably too shallow for anything so big) and then they make it to Venice in only three days! Around southern England then France aand Spain and through the Straits of Gibraltar alone would take more time than that even today even without travelling halfway across the Mediterranean Sea.Sean Connery did well but I certainly won't be buying it, the rest of the movie is a mess.",2,"What a dud ths one turned out to be, I was disappointed!",1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,1811,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'movie', 'based', 'sure', 'hope', 'better', 'movie', 'was.If', 'remember', 'TV', 'ads', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'best', 'bits', ""n't"", 'much', 'exaggeration', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'was', 'good', 'most', 'others', 'were', 'just', 'sort', 'take', 'up', 'space.The', 'idea', 'taking', 'characters', 'several', 'works', '19th', 'century', 'fiction', 'never', 'really', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'often', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'developed', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'U.S.', 'Secret', 'Service', 'how', ""'d"", 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'clue', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'Vampire', 'widow', 'one', 'men', 'who', 'fought', 'Dracula', 'never', 'clue', 'how', ""n't"", 'evil', 'can', 'survive', 'sunlight', ""n't"", 'seem', 'need', 'feed', 'very', 'often', 'either.The', 'best', 'sets', 'were', 'club/hotel', 'Africa', 'where', 'Quatermain', 'recruited', 'League', 'couple', 'libraries', 'London', 'blown', 'shot', 'up', 'Nemo', 'submarine', 'looked', 'as', 'big', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'ways', 'also', 'was', 'razor', 'thin', 'certainly', 'bigger', 'inside', 'outside.I', 'kind', 'liked', 'tank', 'raid', 'evil', 'name', 'was', 'did', 'Bank', 'England', 'bit', 'ahead', 'time', 'mostly', 'looked', 'OK.', 'Nemo', '1930', 'style', 'car', 'was', 'really', 'pushing', 'things', '1899', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'cars', 'were', 'looked', 'were', 'horseless', 'carriages', 'One', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'bits', 'was', 'League', 'journey', 'London', 'Venice', 'First', 'have', 'huge', 'razor', 'thin', 'submarine', 'rising', 'up', 'Thames', 'probably', 'too', 'shallow', 'anything', 'so', 'big', 'then', 'make', 'Venice', 'only', 'three', 'days', 'southern', 'England', 'then', 'France', 'aand', 'Spain', 'Straits', 'Gibraltar', 'alone', 'would', 'take', 'more', 'time', 'even', 'today', 'even', 'travelling', 'halfway', 'Mediterranean', 'Sea.Sean', 'Connery', 'did', 'well', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'rest', 'movie', 'mess']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
613285,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JM5B,A Customer,"[1, 2]","Summary:Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) is a famous hunter and marksman who has retired to Africa.  The movie begins when a messenger arrives to request he assist the British government in tracking down a criminal, The Phantom (Richard Roxburgh), who has been gaining notoriety by attacking different countries with the weapons he has been forcing scientists to develop while he holds both them and their families in captivity.Initially Quatermain declines, but when an attempted assassination on him kills most of his closest friends, he agrees.  Upon his arrival back in England, Quatermain is quickly introduced to the leader and apparent financier of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen M (also Richard Roxburgh, but the fact that M and The Phantom are the same person is revealed much later).  M explains what is going on, then introduces Quatermain to the rest of the 'Extraordinary Gentlepeople' (Gentlemen is actually a misnomer as The League includes a woman): Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), and Rodney Skinner/The Invisible Man (Tony Curran).  There are a couple of additions made to the group, but they require some urging by the initial members, including: Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Tom Sawyer (Shane West), and Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde (Jason Flemyng).Once they have the League together, they begin their journey to stop The Phantom from creating an international arms race where different countries are going to bid on the weaponry he is forcing his captive scientists to make.  The result, The Phantom will become both super-rich and super-powerful.But the League quickly runs into problems as it is revealed there is a traitor among their ranks - Dorian Gray.Overcoming remarkable obstacles, the League (minus Gray) track The Phantom to his hideout in Mongolia where he is producing his weapons and holding the scientists hostage.  The League then puts their particular talents into action to defeat and ultimately kill The Phantom, who is now revealed to be M as well, along with his traitorous ally, Dorian Gray.But, in the process, Quatermain is killed.  However, a sequel isn't out of the question, as an African Shaman's blessing has guaranteed Quatermain's immortality on the continent of Africa, which is where The League buries him.My Comments:I really had no idea what the premise of the movie was supposed to be going into it.  I knew Sean Connery was involved and someone had told me it was going to be somewhat X-Men like, so I was excited.  But then I saw the film...The basic idea, which I must admit is kind of cool, is to combine a bunch of famous characters from famous books all in one adventure.  Quatermain is from H. Rider Haggard's books; Nemo is from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea; Mina Harker is from Dracula; The Invisible Man is from the H.G. Wells novel by the same name; Dorian Gray is from Sherlock Holmes; Tom Sawyer is from Mark Twain's books; and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde is from Robert Louis Stevenson's book.  So, you have a stellar cast, now what do you do with them?This is where the problems begin because the writers of this screenplay don't really know what to do with them.  Considering their abilities, why not give them something small, like, say, saving the world, which is exactly what they end up doing.There are a lot of problems with this movie, but perhaps the biggest is how it just jumps from one location and scene to the next with virtually no attempt to fluidly connect the scenes.  It's almost as if you are just supposed to put the pieces of this semi-coherent story together for yourself.  Considering I was able to summarize it, it obviously can't be completely intelligible, but it's close.Then there is the actual development, or lack thereof, of the characters.  Captain Nemo went from having a cool, small submarine, to being a 'God among men' (quote from X-Men 2).  Somehow he became an expert martial artist and a genius that has developed automotive, ballistic, and marine technology to rival that of 2004.  Tom Sawyer's inclusion in the League is completely coincidental and makes no sense.  There is a minor attempt at a back story for Dorian Gray and Mina Harker, but it isn't particularly convincing.  And guess what they do with The Invisible Man?  As if him being invisible isn't enough to begin with, they take him out of 2/3 of the movie as he just so happens to hide out on Dorian's escape pod when Dorian sabotages the Natilus.  Quatermain is perhaps the only believable character and by far the best portrayed, but when you are locked into a story as bad as this one, there is only so much you can do.  I'm pretty certain I could see Connery's frustration with the movie coming through in his character.The final result is an utterly unbelievable story, even given a major suspension of belief.  I think what happened is the writers wanted the characters to travel but also be limited by time constraints.  As a result, they create ridiculous fast ships and even employ Nemo's ultra-secret Cruise Missile technology to prevent the destruction of Venice, Italy.  Come on!  Combine the ridiculous technology with poor character development and a haphazard story and you have a movie with a lot of potential that doesn't even come close to satisfying.  As much as I wanted this movie to succeed, it didn't.  I don't recommend it.",2,such potential,1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,5351,"['Summary', 'Allan', 'Quatermain', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'famous', 'hunter', 'marksman', 'who', 'retired', 'Africa', 'movie',

613286,A2EOFYRFB292KS,B00005JM5B,"Alberto M. Barral ""NY LuxViewer""","[0, 0]","This movie is all about action, the characters are too many to be pemanently remembered as extraordinary: Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Invisible Man, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and  The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.The only memorable character is an object: The Nautilus submarine. It is a magical combination of modern technology and old world manufacture and luxuries, and because Nemo is so faithful to his Indian heritage, on turning a corner one does not find vulgar machinery at work, but an altar to Kali or Ganesha. When the ship surfaces in a Venetian canal, which is such a complete and total physical  impossibility that it is completely comical, we know we are in the land of never never action.The action itself can barely keep track with the characters, all of which must show off their special attributes to contribute to the story, which is basically good versus evil scientists.Almost all of Venice gets blown up, there is a trip to the Antartica that allows all of them to wear great fur-lined coats, and a lot of speeding under the sea, but I for one feel that a visit to the Nile and the Amazon rivers woudl have been nice additions. The incredible amount of energy this movie shows makes you feel like you've worked out for hours, and the visuals give you a sense of hours spent in luxury shops gawking at incredibly beautiful, useless objects.

613287,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,B00005JM5B,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[0, 3]","The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is the kind of film that, in order to enjoy it, you need to leave your sense of disbelief at home (or, if you are at home, leave it in the closet).  It also helps if you have read either the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill or any of the classic adventure novels from which the League's characters are borrowed (King Solomon's Mines, Dracula, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Portrait of Dorian Grey, just to name a few).  If you embrace the idea that this is a popcorn-adventure movie and not one of those serious Oscar-contending films, then you'll have a good time.As comic-book-based movies go, LXG isn't on the same legendary adaptation level as Superman: The Movie or Spiderman.  Nevertheless, the conceit of uniting some of the best adventure/fantasy characters from late 19th Century literature and pitting them against a clever wannabe world dominator in order to stop a world war in 1899 is not exactly a bad one.  And of course it helps to have Sean Connery (Dr. No, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) as the head of an ensemble that includes TV's La Femme Nikita's Peta Wilson, Shane West, Stuart Townsend and Jason Fleming.  As legendary hunter Allan Quatermain Connery (who's also executive producer of this project) exudes world-weary cynicism and a sense of honorable duty as he leads a group of literary superheroes on a quest to stop the mysterious Fantom, a war-hungry arms merchant/inventor who seeks to pit the European superpowers against each other.  Of course, it's up to the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to stop this madman and preserve world peace (at least until 1914!).Screenwriter James Dale Robinson and director Stephen Norrington keep things moving at a brisk pace, and the whole movie sparkles with a sense of fun and humor that was clearly lacking in both Daredevil and The Hulk, both of which are examples of how not to make a comic book movie.  LXG succeeds where many of this genre don't, partly because it doesn't take itself too seriously, but mostly because it is fast-paced and dares to take chances.",3,"LXG is no Spiderman, yet it is fun and witty....",1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,2099,"['League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'kind', 'film', 'order', 'enjoy', 'need', 'leave', 'sense', 'disbelief', 'home', 'are', 'home', 'leave', 'closet', 'also', 'have', 'read', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'Kevin', ""O'Neill"", 'classic', 'adventure', 'novels', 'League', 'characters', 'are', 'borrowed', 'King', 'Solomon', 'Mines', 'Dracula', '20,000', 'Leagues', 'Sea', 'Portrait', 'Dorian', 'Grey', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'embrace', 'idea', 'popcorn-adventure', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'serious', 'Oscar-contending', 'films', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'time.As', 'comic-book-based', 'movies', 'go', 'LXG', ""n't"", 'same', 'legendary', 'adaptation', 'level', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'Spiderman', 'Nevertheless', 'conceit', 'uniting', 'best', 'adventure/fantasy', 'characters', 'late', '19th', 'Century', 'literature', 'pitting', 'clever', 'wannabe', 'world', 'dominator', 'order', 'stop', 'world', 'war', '1899', 'not', 'exactly', 'bad', 'one', 'course', 'have', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Dr.', 'No', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'head', 'ensemble', 'TV', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'Shane', 'West', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'Jason', 'Fleming', 'legendary', 'hunter', 'Allan', 'Quatermain', 'Connery', 'who', 'also', 'executive', 'producer', 'project', 'world-weary', 'cynicism', 'sense', 'honorable', 'duty', 'group', 'literary', 'superheroes', 'quest', 'stop', 'mysterious', 'Fantom', 'war-hungry', 'arms', 'merchant/inventor', 'who', 'pit', 'European', 'superpowers', 'other', 'course', 'up', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'stop', 'madman', 'preserve', 'world', 'peace', 'least', '1914', '.Screenwriter', 'James', 'Dale', 'Robinson', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Norrington', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'brisk', 'pace', 'whole', 'movie', 'sparkles', 'sense', 'fun', 'humor', 'was', 'clearly', 'lacking', 'Daredevil', 'Hulk', 'are', 'examples', 'how', 'not', 'make', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'LXG', 'where', 'many', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'partly', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'mostly', 'fast-paced', 'take', 'chances']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
613288,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00005JM5B,Alex Udvary,"[2, 8]","When I first heard about this movie I didn't want to see it at all. I'm getting a little sick of Hollywood making comic book movies every month. So far we have had ""Daredevil"", ""X-Men 2"", and ""Hulk"". But, it wasn't until the film was released that I found out what the movie is about. For those who are ignorant like me when it comes to comic books the movie is about a group of men being assembled together in order to stop a madman from world domination. OK, so that part sounds boring. But, it's the characters who are brought together that caught my interest. The characters are classic literature characters such as; ""Dr. Jekyll\Mr. Hyde"", ""The Invisible Man"", ""Captain Nemo"" and Mina Harker (From ""Dracula""). This sounds like a good fun idea to me. I thought I would get a kick out of seeing people playing these characters. And I was mildly right.""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" makes one big mistake that plagues the movie throughout. It takes itself too serious. People who walk into this movie should more or less know what they are getting. You can expect big loud explosions. Semi-suggestive material. Lots of action. And mild but unwitty attempts at humor when the characters are in serious danger. In a dare I say ""James Bond"" style. And that is exactly what you will see when watching this movie. But, I was expecting a bit more tongue-in-cheek humor. I was expecting the movie to be a bit more ""fun"". The movie I feel most will agree basically has a ludicrous plot but the writer James Dale Robinson didn't seem to think so. The movie is trying to be kind of ""heavy"". The only way this movie could of worked I thought was by knowing what its limitations were and making the best of them.There are some things I liked about the movie. I liked the look of the film though I'm willing to bet all of it was fake and done with special effects, but, it was still nice to look at. I didn't mind the performances but I think Sean Connery comes out looking the best. He's playing a sort of Indiana Jones kind of character. He is after all Jones' father ya know? But other than that I don't see much else to recommend.Besides the serious tone of the movie I didn't like what they did with the ""Dr.Jekyll"" character. When he turns into ""Mr. Hyde"" he looks a lot like ""The Incredible Hulk"". I don't remember Spencer Tracy becoming a 10 foot monster when he played the part. Also the camerawork bothered me. At times I felt it was moving too much. I was becoming dizzy. The action is moving so fast that it seems like it just can't keep up.If your looking for a mindless good time and a nice way to spend an evening after a hard day's work I'm not 100% convinced this is the best way to spend your time and more importantly your money. Though I guess there is an audience for this kind of thing. Whether or not most of that audience will enjoy it, I'm not sure. I don't hate this movie, but I don't like it very much either.

613289,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,B00005JM5B,Amanda Pike,"[0, 1]","League of not-so-great gentlemen:A review of League of Extraordinary GentlemenOkay, where do I begin?  Well, when the making of footage shows the director of film (which was based off a graphic novel with the intention of getting young people interested in reading the classics again) goes out of his way tell you 'The characters in this movie are from these huge, archaic books I never read so I found a writer that at least read some of them.'  That's the first warning sign that a film is in trouble.I think my biggest pet peeve, and ironically also my favourite part, was Dorian Gray.  It was not Dorian Gray of the novel, not authentically anyway.  This version of Dorian dies when he looks at the painting. This bothers me because so many people who have never read The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde now think that looking at the painting would kill Dorian.  I've heard of people argue with those who have read the book to insist they got it wrong, that stabbing the painting doesn't kill him, it's looking at it!  WRONG!  Dorian looked at the painting a lot, that was sort of the point.A big issue with this Dorian is M stole the painting from Dorian's Foyer.  Quartermain notices the spot where it had been.  If looking at it would kill him why did Dorian have it hanging in his foyer?  Did he cover his eyes every time he walked into his home?Now for the serious flaws of the time line.Tom Sawyer's story takes place with him, at age twelve,  before the civil war.  That means it has be before 1865.  Tom Sawyear cannot be a teenager in 1899.Mina Harker:  Mina Harker's story takes place in 1897.  So In two years she was made a vampire, widowed, dated Dorian, and became a Chemist?Dorian Gray:  Dorian Gray becomes immortal in 1891. So In eight years he lectured at a university where Quartermain was a boy.  Less than eight years after college and he looks like that?  The boy didn't age well!Another thing about the film that didn't sit right for me is Dorian's life was in danger.  M had something that could kill him at any time, and Mina pretty much executed him for that.  But because he once broke up with her that's okay?  M might as well have had a gun to him the whole time but Mina was right to kill him?  Sure he acted cold but would it really have been better if he was sniveling and pleading?  That didn't make Dorian look that evil to me or Mina look that good.Under tight scrutiny League of Extraordinary Gentlemen would require a TARDIS for those characters to all meet at those points in their lives.  Just because they're all from the nineteenth century does not mean that their stories can mesh with a plausible storyline.  My gradfather was born in the 1920s.  That doesn't mean he and I could be teenagers together because I was born in 1981.This film can be fun as brain candy but under tight observation it makes little sense and it's blatantly obvious the director didn't read or respect the original novels the characters came from, which is a shame because the original purpose of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen's graphic novel was to try to get young people interested in reading the classics.",2,Fun but not very consistant,1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,3142,"['League', 'not-so-great', 'gentlemen', 'review', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'GentlemenOkay', 'where', 'do', 'begin', 'Well', 'when', 'making', 'footage', 'director', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'off', 'graphic', 'novel', 'intention', 'getting', 'young', 'people', 'interested', 'reading', 'classics', 'again', 'way', ""'The"", 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'huge', 'archaic', 'books', 'never', 'read', 'so', 'found', 'writer', 'least', 'read', 'first', 'warning', 'sign', 'film', 'trouble.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'pet', 'peeve', 'ironically', 'also', 'favourite', 'part', 'was', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'was', 'not', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'novel', 'not', 'authentically', 'anyway', 'version', 'Dorian', 'dies', 'when', 'painting', 'bothers', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'now', 'think', 'looking', 'painting', 'would', 'kill', 'Dorian', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'argue', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'insist', 'got', 'wrong', 'stabbing', 'painting', ""n't"", 'kill', 'looking', 'WRONG', 'Dorian', 'looked', 'painting', 'lot', 'was', 'sort', 'point.A', 'big', 'issue', 'Dorian', 'M', 'stole', 'painting', 'Dorian', 'Foyer', 'Quartermain', 'spot', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'would', 'kill', 'why', 'did', 'Dorian', 'have', 'hanging', 'foyer', 'Did', 'cover', 'eyes', 'time', 'walked', 'home', 'Now', 'serious', 'flaws', 'time', 'Sawyer', 'story', 'place', 'age', 'twelve', 'civil', 'war', 'be', '1865', 'Tom', 'Sawyear', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'teenager', '1899.Mina', 'Harker', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'story', 'place', '1897', 'So', 'two', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'vampire', 'widowed', 'dated', 'Dorian', 'became', 'Chemist', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'immortal', '1891', 'So', 'eight', 'years', 'lectured', 'university', 'where', 'Quartermain', 'was', 'boy', 'Less', 'eight', 'years', 'college', 'boy', 'did', ""n't"", 'age', 'well', 'thing', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'right', 'Dorian', 'life', 'was', 'danger', 'M', 'had', 'something', 'could', 'kill', 'time', 'Mina', 'pretty', 'much', 'executed', 'once', 'broke', 'up', 'okay', 'M', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'had', 'gun', 'whole', 'time', 'Mina', 'was', 'right', 'kill', 'Sure', 'acted', 'cold', 'would', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'sniveling', 'pleading', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Dorian', 'look', 'Mina', 'look', 'good.Under', 'tight', 'scrutiny', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'would', 'require', 'TARDIS', 'characters', 'meet', 'points', 'lives', 'Just', ""'re"", 'nineteenth', 'century', 'not', 'mean', 'stories', 'can', 'mesh', 'plausible', 'storyline', 'gradfather', 'was', 'born', '1920s', ""n't"", 'mean', 'could', 'be', 'teenagers', 'together', 'was', 'born', '1981.This', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'brain', 'candy', 'tight', 'observation', 'little', 'sense', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'respect', 'original', 'novels', 'characters', 'came', 'shame', 'original', 'purpose', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'graphic', 'novel', 'was', 'try', 'get', 'young', 'people', 'interested', 'reading', 'classics']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

613294,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00005JM5B,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[0, 4]","For me this was an eagerly awaited movie outing, although I have to confess as to NOT having previously read the comics. The story is fairly straightforward - Sean Connery plays latter day Indiana Jones, Alan Quartermain (Kings Solomon's Mines)who reluctantly comes to the call of the British Empire to save the World from the ""Phantom"" and his army of technologically advanced goons, by leading a band of ""Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (including one woman), in a classic Good vs Evil scenario. His band of heroes include, Dr Jekyll (& Mr Hyde), Dorian Gray, Mina Harker, an Invisible Man, Captain Nemo, and Agent Sawyer, all with their own ""special"" talents to contribute to the crime busting organisation. Connery is excellent (as usual) as the lead, and the acting performances are great allround, the movie is overladen with spectacular SfX, and the story builds nicely throughout. I felt the main problem with the movie - is that it is a sad reflection on the general ignorance of literary characters of old by people today, that each member in the film in turn, has to play out a little cameo, explaining who and what they are, and share their emotional baggage with the viewer. What results is a multitude of mini subplots inside a main story, itself trying to be inventive and twisted, and ultimately coming across as a bit of a mess.It is very difficult to convey deep character development inside an essentially ""tongue in cheek"" romp around computer generated 1899. And although the movie never sets out to be taken seriously (consider the subject matter for a moment), it seems to try and do so, at every given opportunity. It is a little slow to get going, and then fills the viewer with anticipation, which it never really delivers on fully. Don't get me wrong, it is an entertaining movie, and OK at around 1hr 50 mins, but it could have, and should have been better. Sure to be a winner at the box office, and later on DVD and Video, just don't get your hopes up too high.",3,"Good Fun, but a bit muddled - 3.5 Stars",1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,1984,"['was', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'movie', 'outing', 'have', 'confess', 'NOT', 'having', 'previously', 'read', 'comics', 'story', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'plays', 'latter', 'day', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Alan', 'Quartermain', 'Kings', 'Solomon', 'Mines', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'call', 'British', 'Empire', 'save', 'World', 'Phantom', 'army', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'goons', 'leading', 'band', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'including', 'one', 'woman', 'classic', 'Good', 'vs', 'Evil', 'scenario', 'band', 'heroes', 'include', 'Dr', 'Jekyll', 'Mr', 'Hyde', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'Agent', 'Sawyer', 'own', 'special', 'talents', 'contribute', 'crime', 'busting', 'organisation', 'Connery', 'excellent', 'usual', 'lead', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'allround', 'movie', 'overladen', 'spectacular', 'SfX', 'story', 'nicely', 'felt', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'sad', 'reflection', 'general', 'ignorance', 'literary', 'characters', 'old', 'people', 'today', 'member', 'film', 'turn', 'play', 'out', 'little', 'cameo', 'explaining', 'who', 'what', 'are', 'share', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'viewer', 'What', 'results', 'multitude', 'mini', 'subplots', 'main', 'story', 'trying', 'be', 'inventive', 'twisted', 'ultimately', 'coming', 'bit', 'mess.It', 'very', 'difficult', 'convey', 'deep', 'character', 'development', 'essentially', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'romp', 'computer', 'generated', '1899', 'movie', 'never', 'out', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'consider', 'subject', 'matter', 'moment', 'try', 'do', 'so', 'given', 'opportunity', 'little', 'slow', 'get', 'going', 'then', 'viewer', 'anticipation', 'never', 'really', 'delivers', 'fully', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'OK', '1hr', '50', 'mins', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Sure', 'be', 'winner', 'box', 'office', 'later', 'DVD', 'Video', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'too', 'high']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
613295,A928WN8NV03WZ,B00005JM5B,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[4, 6]","I don't think that this movie is as bad as a lot of people have said, it didn't fulfill its potential, but it wasn't bad.  The main problems were it was a hard genre to get across.  It is known as ""steam punk"", a spin off of the cyber punk genre.  Where they are using high tech items, but with technology present in their age.  Examples of this are the short lived series The Secret Adventures of Jules Vern, the movie Wild Wild West, and the Deadlands game.  They had to explain a lot of this in the movie since the average movie goer wouldn't get it.A lot of the weapons they use are way beyond what they would have used in that era, and they aren't what they were.  The body armor is heavy metal plates designed to stop bullets, the guns are heavy brass weapons, the power suits and clunky and slow moving.  But from 20-50 years ahead of their time.The characters they use are for the most part well depicted from their source material.  Alan Quartermain is a bitter sexist old man who is regretful of his past and the British Empire.  Mina Harker is distant and fighting with her supernatural nature.  Dr Jekyl is repressed and tired of fighting with Mr Hyde.  Mr Hyde is brutal and thuggish, but brillant.  Captain Nemo is still searching for meaning having abandoned both India and Britain.  Dorian Grey is decadent and bored, nothing can cause him worry, he's effectively immortal.  The only character that doesn't seem to fit is Tom Sawyer, who was added to give the group an American pull, but fits as a surrogate son for Quartermain.  As well as the ""invisible man"", who they had to change.  Due to some legal conflicts they couldn't use the name Hawley Griffinm, so created a believable character, a thief who'd stolen the formula.All in all this is a good movie with a few flaws.  The plot was interesting and thought provoking.  The characters seemed like they were the broken down villians from the previous books.  All of them for the most part tired of their lives, and looking for some sort of meaning in their existence outside of society.The bad guys are rates as being dull, but at the same time they are realistic.  I do admit, I would have preferred and over the top villian, but sometimes a straight one adds to a movie.  Like Robert Carlyle in ""the World is Not Enough"".The plot is interesting, the possible world war that could happen 20 years before its time, this time with deadlier weapons.  As well as some of the twists that happen along the way.I wouldn't say that this is for everyone, more for the sci fi fan or history buff.  But it was good as an action flick and as a sci fi potential.  But think it could have been better.  The good elements were great, but were felt a bit stifled.  The characters were a lot more pc in this version than they were in the graphic novel it was based off of.

And if such endeavor would make some young people read the original books, one can certainly sympathize with that. But this film is dull. The action scenes are uninspired. And one wonders if the filmmakers even read the original material: here Dorian Gray has more lives than Terminator, Verne's Captain Nemo looks more like Sandokan, Jekyll is inspired more by the incredible Hulk than by the character of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Tom Saywer is a hothead cowboy rather than Mark Twain's country boy, etc. There are fine actors here (Sean Connery, for one) but they look embarrassed here, as well as they should be.

Comics are a medium that can make extremely illogical scenes seem plausible, whereas film can take that same scene and render it ridiculous.  Consider these examples from the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: The League is introduced to the Nautilus, a prototype Submarine.  It's roughly the size of the Titanic with sexy lines rivaling anything modern, with speed and maneuvering capabilities to match.  Keep in mind that this is supposed to be @ 1899. Oops, somebody took a high-performance sports car and tacked a body shell over it to resemble a Victorian land yacht.  That's the vehicle our heroes are jerking around through the streets of Venice on a chase scene.  Is it still 1899? In his over-the-top ""Darth Vader meets Colonel Klink"" getup, the villain just looks like he stepped out of a comic book.  Since this is a film, he shouldn't. Captive scientists in the villain's lair are performing genetic manipulations such as cloning with samples from our heroes.  Uhhhh.... There's much more, but I think your intelligence was insulted enough with those.A few words about the plot:  a motley assortment of people from around the world with extraordinary abilities are called to help Britannia foil an evil plot to start World War 1.  These include fictional literary characters like Dr. Jeckyll/Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, and Captain Nemo, as well as a few made-ups.  An interesting set up with lots of potential that just didn't get explored enough IMHO.  However, because of the above-mentioned problems with translating this to a film that was, oddly enough, marketed toward teens and adults sophisticated enough to sneer at it, this concept just seemed stupid.Some nice things can be said about this movie.  The cast was well-chosen for their character roles, and do reasonably good jobs.  Visually, TLOEG was a wonderful rendition of a Victorian world made fantastic.  The special effects and art direction at least deserve nominations.  But that, my friends, is IT.Rent TLOEG if you're into the comic series, just so you can see how our modern special effects technology did justice to it.

Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[14, 17]","When I first heard that they were doing a film adaptation of Alan Moore's classic graphic novel The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen I was very excited at the prospect. Alan Moore's alternate historical tale of late 19th-century literary characters of Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, Allan Quatermain, Invisible Man and Mr. Hyde was well-received by both critics and fans of comics. This story was one of those kinds that just begged to be made into a film and I remember many discussions with other fans of who exactly should play the characters from the book. This property was one of those can't-miss. But too much tinkering with Moore's story, characters and overall themes made too much of a mess of a film.I'll start by admitting that I enjoyed the film enough. The film had enough action sequences to keep my attention. The story was fun enough to follow, albeit confusing since I was expecting something else on the screen after I'd read the graphic novel prior to seeing the film. The special-effects work were done well enough, though a few shots here and there looked to much like CGI. LXG looked good overall, but it wasn't the League that Moore created that I so enjoyed reading. As I said earlier, too much tinkering by the producers, director and writers from the original source material made what was an ok, fun film experience into something even better.The film that I saw was so different from the book that it should've been called something else. Characters were added that were never in the book. Usually such film adaptations of comic books make such changes, but in LXG they made major character additions that changed the entire dynamics of the team and those they were were up against. Some characters from the book that had pivotal supporting roles were removed outright. By the time all the changes were done the film and the book were two separately, distinct works that only had certain characters in common and that was it.In the end, as a big fan of Alan Moore's graphic novel I was disappointed to no end. I still enjoyed the film once I realized that I wasn't seeing the book come to life but watching a wholly different animal. LXG (as the studio sometimes marketed the film as) is an ok enough film even fun if one was into such types of entertainment, but it could've been better and it should've been.

613301,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,B00005JM5B,audrey,"[1, 1]","There are two ways to evaluate this film -- as an adaptation of a popular graphic novel and as a film in its own right -- and this film fails on both counts.  I wanted to like this movie -- I love adventure films and Sean Connery, I really enjoyed the graphic novel on which it was based, and I am a fan of the literary figures depicted -- but it was such a mess.The premise is fantastic -- a team of 19th century literary figures is assembled to fight for the British empire -- a Victorian Action League -- awesome!!  The cast is great, the acting is fine, the sets and costumes and makeup look great and capture the mood of the novel -- but the screenplay is a gigantic mess.  You'll be lost fast if you aren't familiar with the characters -- Wilde's Dorian Gray, Mina Harker from Dracula, Wells's Invisible Man, Haggard's Allan Quartermain, Verne's Captain Nemo and Stevenson's Jekyll/Hyde combo, with Twain's adult Tom Sawyer thrown in for good measure.  The characters and the team aren't really developed or motivated well and the  villain never seems as interesting as the league.  Impressive action sequences blur together and the ending is cliched, abrupt and mawkish.Warning! Minor spoilers: If you're a fan of the graphic novel, you will probably see this anyway.  It's irresistible.  But lower your expectations.  The comic has Mina Harker assembling the league, and she finds Quatermain is a slovenly drunk, but in the film he is the leader and the assembler (hmmm, and the executive producer -- coincidence?), and she is a vampire.  While I think having her a vampire was a good move, other departures from the written material are questionable.  Instead of taking place in London, the team moves to Venice (so the filmmakers can blow it up, basically) where they have a car chase (even though Venice has no streets that would enable the car to race around!) and then we see Piazza San Marco destroyed.  Strangely, while I was willing to accept the league of fictional characters, watching the basilica collapse was quite jarring.  I think adding Tom Sawyer (to appeal to Americans, presumably) was goofy, though the actor did a fine job, and adding Dorian Gray was questionable as well, though actor Stuart Townsend (the original Aragorn before being replaced by Viggo Mortensen) also gives a fine performance.DVD extras include two commentary tracks -- one with the producers and the actors who played the Invisible Man, Tom Sawyer and Dr. Jekyll, and one with the costumer, fx people and makeup artist -- no commentary by star and executive producer Connery!  Also included are 12 deleted or extended scenes, Assembling the League -- a set of featurettes about the source material and adaptation, costumes, Hyde, the Nemomobile and Venice, and a bizarre &quot;special message&quot; psa on the dangers of driving under the influence of marijuana.

Marold""","[2, 6]","`The Society of Extraordinary Gentlemen' is quite simply a comic book movie done almost exclusively to revel in special effects excesses. Virtually the only useful thing I got from this DVD is the fact that Sean Connery was offered and turned down parts in both `The Matrix' and `The Lord of the Rings'. I hope Sir Sean is regretting the fact that he gave up the chance to play Gandalf in the hands down most successful fantasy movie series of all time!Since I am recommending you not bother buying this clunker, I will review the premise.The story gathers together seven major fictional character from 19th century novels. Specifically, there is:Alan Quatermain (Connery's character) from H. Rider Haggert's novels.Captain Nemo from Jules Verne's novels, especially '20 Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'.Dorian Gray from Oscar Wilde's `The Picture of Dorian Gray'Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde from Robert Lewis Stevenson's `Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde'.The Invisible Man from H. G. Wells `The Invisible Man'.Tom Sawyer from Mark Twain's `Tom Sawyer' and `Huckleberry Finn'Minna Harker from Bram Stoker's `Dracula'The cast is made even more improbable by casting Dr. Hyde as the perp of Edgar Allen Poe's `Murders in the Rue Morgue'.The immediate and most obvious anomoly here is the absence of the singularly most useful character, Sherlock Holmes, or at least his even more shadowy brother, Mycroft Holmes.

Yeah, I know it was a comic book first, but the whole concept is a totally outlandish ""what if..."" contrivance. I knew this going in and adjusted my expectations accordingly. Despite the bad reviews and bad word-of-mouth, I really had a good time!Yeah, it's silly and there are lots of obvious lapses and holes in the plot and execution, but it was fun and succeeded in entertaining me in spite of them. In the end, I think it was the fact that it was so totally over-the-top that won me over.Interestingly, I was impressed by things that the film makers seem to have considered throw aways. Having Alan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, and Dorian Gray among the characters was OK, but having the chutzpah to include Mina Harker in the group really sold it to me - she and Dorian gray were by far the most interesting characters in the group. The sly (and not so sly) references to other fictions and films were entertaining. They had the guts to make the silly parts really silly and play them straight without winking at the audience, which is just what the material needed.Also, just like two of my favorite TV series, ""Wild Wild West"" and ""The Adventures of Briscoe County, Jr"", the anachronisms  of setting it in 1899 was fun.What was silliest? Probably everything involving the Nautilus or Captain Nemo's other technological anachronisms. We simply don't want to ask how he can drive a submarine which appears to be about 1/3 the length of the Titanic into the Venetian canals. We also aren't supposed to wonder how vampire Mina can survive in the sunlight.About the only thing that really didn't work was the CGI Mr. Hyde who was essentially a Hulk clone.OK, so you've been warned...

613321,AWNKEM8DAG8PY,B00005JM5B,Brian Conway,"[2, 5]","The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen takes its concept from the graphic novel by Alan Moore, pitting a group of 19th century literary characters into the real world to fight the forces of evil. The cast includes legendary hunter Alan Quartermain, Captain Nemo of the Nautilus, Mina Harker of Dracula fame, the infamous Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and The Invisible Man as well as two new characters not found in the graphic novels: Dorian Grey and Tom Sawyer. The League is sent on a quest to apprehend The Phantom, a mysterious villian trying to start a World War. Throughout the film, the tone is heavy-handed and there is hardly any proper character development or humor except for a few one-liners which fail to generate any laughs. The mystery behind the members of the League themselves, the brilliant wit and dialogue, and the slow, uneasy build-up of trust that forms among the group that was so excellently done in the book are all missing here. Instead they are replaced with ludicrous action scenes featuring fully automatic weapons and a high speed car chase through Venice among a myriad of other things that make absolutely no sense for a movie that takes place in 1899, no matter how absurd the technology of the original graphic novel. Granted that the overall plot of Moore's miniseries wasn't much stronger than the bland plot twists here, the writers and director would have benefitted from borrowing more of Alan Moore's ideas apart from the basic concept itself for the film. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is still a fantastic idea that was, unfortunately, poorly handled.

He supposedly wants to start a war in Europe to make money selling high-tech (by 1899 standards) weapons like tanks, body armor and machine guns. Alas, it's all mainly a ruse just to steal the heroes superpowers (something you may not get unless you listen to the commentary track).If you can forget the hard-to-understand story and just dwell on the eye-popping visuals, it's a more enjoyable experience. The characters in the movie are interesting group of what-ifs:1) What if Alan Quartermain, the original Indiana Jones, was part of a team instead of being on his own...2) What if a (woman) vampire decided to fight on the side of good...3) What if a thief stole the invisible man's formula and couldn't benefit from it conventionally...4) What if a man who can't die must be killed...5) What if Captain Nemo was swashbuckling Indian man...6) What if Dr. Jeckyl's alterego, the brutish Mr. Hyde, could direct his energy towards fighting bad guys (instead of harrassing women)...7) What if the writer Tom Sawyer went to the Old West, learned how to be a gunfighter, and then ended up in Europe for some reason...The best parts were:1) Mr. Hyde (think &quot;Hulk&quot; lite) and a totally outrageous Mr. Hyde #2 (a different guy - think &quot;Hulk&quot; on steroids) get into a huge building-crunching fight.2) Much of Venice Italy gets destroyed until the League crew step in to dramatically stop a supposed domino-effect (which wasn't really occuring - the buildings were simply collapsing).3) Capt. Nemo has an ornately designed,900-foot &quot;Nautilus&quot; submarine (that's nuclear powered) AND a 6-wheeled automobile, that both come in handy.4) The final battle scenes between the good and the bad guys incorporated just about every fighting technique and special effect that exists.The worst part was simply trying to follow what was going on and figuring out why they were doing certain things.

Any fan of knockoffs like Richard Chamberlain's Quartermain movie will enjoy it. The production is excellent and the special effects are incredibly well done. I have never seen transitions of characters to their alter egos any smoother.The characters right out of the pages of wonderful books about adventurers and science fiction wonders give us a nice blend of good and evil.These forces both have their share of tricks and fascinating devices that are ahead of their time. I think Sean Connery does a nice job of grounding the movie in at least a little believability. His character seems the most realistic and his performance is memorable. All the rest the cast are well suited to their roles and do a fine job of making us like them or hate them as their roles require. The role of a female Vampire seems a little contrived to include a woman in the group of gentlemen, but it is very well performed by Peta Wilson. I also loved the bat minion touch.I am sure some will tell you the characters are not true to their book counter parts.

If you can suspend disbelief you can enjoy this but there are times when you have to shut off your brain and your common sense to do so. The visuals are at times ridiculous - the Nautilus surfaces for the first time in what is presumably the Thames and it is taller than a building - which doesn't seem possible, or practical and is not at all exciting - not to mention the design of the ship itself is - well it isn't the Disney version, which is fine - but it is just overly ornate, impactical and not visually appealing - the interiors are much too spacious for a submarine - really the whole thing is a let down. Mr. Hyde is another example - I understand he is supposed to be an 1800's version of the Hulk in terms of size and strength in this films mythos but he just seems to big - like the effects guys created him in the wrong scale - that and visually ridiculous - I get that they were making him a gorrila man so they could combine Murders in the Rue Morgue mythology together with Dr J and Mr H but he didn't need to be a giant - and the musulature looks idiotic. The pace of this film feels rushed at times. We aren't given a proper introduction to these characters prior to their recruitment into the league - which may have helped - and Connery, much missed and much loved post retirement, just feels too old for what they have him doing here. Fight scenes which are clearly stunt doubles etc. The film as a whole is enjoyable - don't let the shortcomings stop you - it's just that you have to be willing to suspend disbelief and common sense to enjoy - back to the nauilus... they have it moving thru the canals of venice - a ship (surfaced) as tall as a building moving thru the canals of venice? you wonder if people were really paying attention when they made this as it could have been more than it was - still overall entertaining, stupid fun...2 stars plus one for Mr. Connery's parting shot.",3,Sean Connery's final film,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,2029,"['best', 'way', 'can', 'describe', 'TLOEG', 'tonal', 'counterpart', 'film', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'fun', 'movie', 'flawed', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'can', 'enjoy', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'have', 'shut', 'off', 'brain', 'common', 'sense', 'do', 'so', 'visuals', 'are', 'times', 'ridiculous', 'Nautilus', 'surfaces', 'first', 'time', 'what', 'presumably', 'Thames', 'taller', 'building', ""n't"", 'seem', 'possible', 'practical', 'not', 'exciting', 'not', 'mention', 'design', 'ship', 'well', ""n't"", 'Disney', 'version', 'fine', 'just', 'overly', 'ornate', 'impactical', 'not', 'visually', 'appealing', 'interiors', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'spacious', 'submarine', 'really', 'whole', 'thing', 'let', 'down', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'example', 'understand', 'supposed', 'be', '1800', 'version', 'Hulk', 'terms', 'size', 'strength', 'films', 'mythos', 'just', 'big', 'effects', 'guys', 'created', 'wrong', 'scale', 'visually', 'ridiculous', 'get', 'were', 'making', 'gorrila', 'man', 'could', 'combine', 'Murders', 'Rue', 'Morgue', 'mythology', 'together', 'Dr', 'J', 'Mr', 'H', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'giant', 'musulature', 'idiotic', 'pace', 'film', 'feels', 'rushed', 'times', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'proper', 'introduction', 'characters', 'prior', 'recruitment', 'league', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'Connery', 'much', 'missed', 'much', 'loved', 'post', 'retirement', 'just', 'feels', 'too', 'old', 'what', 'have', 'doing', 'here', 'Fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'clearly', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'etc', 'film', 'whole', 'enjoyable', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'shortcomings', 'stop', 'just', 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'common', 'sense', 'enjoy', 'back', 'nauilus', 'have', 'moving', 'canals', 'venice', 'ship', 'surfaced', 'as', 'tall', 'building', 'moving', 'canals', 'venice', 'wonder', 'people', 'were', 'really', 'paying', 'attention', 'when', 'made', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'was', 'still', 'overall', 'entertaining', 'stupid', 'fun', '2', 'stars', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Connery', 'parting', 'shot']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

If it's based on a comic book it's going to be big, loud, dumb and ridiculous. If you don't go into ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" expecting Oscar-caliber work you won't be disappointed.The movie is set in 1899. Characters that we know from the literature of the times are assembled as the League: Alan Quartermain, The Invisible Man, Dorian Gray, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Dina Harker from Dracula. They are asked to work together to stop a man called The Phantom who is amassing a huge army and futuristic weapons to take over the world. You don't need to know much more because in the end it doesn't make any sense anyway. But why should it, it's source material is a comic book.The movie is fast paced with some good special effects and well staged action scenes. There are also some bad effects and poorly staged action scenes, cliches aplenty and some dreadful dialog. I didn't take any of it too seriously and found myself enjoying the movie quite a bit. If you absolutely can't stand people with automatic weapons shooting at point blank range and not hitting anything or effects so overblown you can't believe them, this isn't the movie for you. On the other hand, if you can suspend your disbelief and just politely shake your head at some of the more ridiculous scenes, I would recommend ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.""",3,"3.5 stars--Over-the-top, ridiculous, fast paced, action adventure comic book style",1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,1473,"['always', 'feel', 'have', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', ""'re"", 'watch', 'can', 'judge', 'accordingly', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'going', 'be', 'big', 'loud', 'dumb', 'ridiculous', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'expecting', 'Oscar-caliber', 'work', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'movie', 'set', '1899', 'Characters', 'know', 'literature', 'times', 'are', 'assembled', 'League', 'Alan', 'Quartermain', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'Dina', 'Harker', 'Dracula', 'are', 'asked', 'work', 'together', 'stop', 'man', 'called', 'Phantom', 'who', 'amassing', 'huge', 'army', 'futuristic', 'weapons', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'much', 'more', 'because', 'end', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'anyway', 'why', 'should', 'source', 'material', 'comic', 'book.The', 'movie', 'fast', 'paced', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'well', 'staged', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'bad', 'effects', 'poorly', 'staged', 'action', 'scenes', 'cliches', 'aplenty', 'dreadful', 'dialog', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'found', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'absolutely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'people', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'shooting', 'point', 'blank', 'range', 'not', 'hitting', 'anything', 'effects', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""n't"", 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'just', 'politely', 'shake', 'head', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'would', 'recommend', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
613340,AXWEP7NQ7TFTC,B00005JM5B,C. J. Schaps,"[2, 3]","Honestly, I cannot understand why anyone could not like this movie.  This has to be my favorite movie of 2003 and I saw Finding Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the Lord of the Rings.From the reviews of the movie, one would get the idea that it is the worst movie ever made, but in reality, there are a lot worse ones.  Sure, the cast is not made up of big names, but they are still quite talented.  Sean Connery is very good as Quartermein, Jason Flemyng is excellent as Dr. Henry Jekyll, and Stuart Townsend is perfect as Dorian Gray.  Although the latter two are not mega stars like Connery, they are still very talented British stage actors.Another reason that I like the movie is that the main characters are Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll (and of course Mr. Hyde), Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man (but not the original one from the Wells book), Dorian Gray, and Tom Sawyer.  With the exception of Sawyer, who I feel was thrown in because they wanted to &quot;American-ize&quot; the movie, the characters in the movie are just like I remembered them from the books they came from.  I read and loved the books &quot;Dracula&quot; (Bram Stoker), &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (Robert Louis Stevenson), &quot;20000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (Jules Verne), &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (H.G. Wells), &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (Oscar Wilde), and &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (Mark Twain).  The characters are all what I imagined them to be when I was reading the books, so seeing them on screen is very cool.In some places the special effects are a little shoddy, but I really didn't mind because I was too busy watching great actors act out great material.  In my opinion, The League of Extrordinary Gentlemen is right up there with The X-men.Don't let the reviews here scare you off.

613341,A1YWUPCT83WY48,B00005JM5B,"Claude Avary ""West Coast Reader""","[0, 1]","This film receives a lot of criticism, but I actually quite enjoyed it. It's loaded with flaws, such as messy explanations, confusing turns in plot, and character developments that don't quite go anyplace...but it's nonetheless exciting, well-designed, filled with tremendous visual effects, fast-moving, and crammed with wonderful characters from classic literature. As a home viewing experience on a Saturday night, it's certainly worth your time.Based on Alan Moore's classic graphic novel, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" tampers a bit with Moore's original idea, toning down its violence and adding in the Tom Sawyer character (probably to increase appeal to Americans, and American teenage girls in particular, but still stays true to the fantastic idea of linking all of the later Victorian hero characters into a sort of early Just League of Great Britain: we've got Alan Quartermain from H. Rider Haggard's ""King Solomon's Mines"" (perfectly played by Sean Connery), Dorian Grey from Oscar Wilde's ""Picture of Dorian Grey,"" the extremely sexy vampiress Mina Harker from ""Dracula"" (Peta Wilson in a very steamy, repressed performance), Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo and his Nautilis from ""20,000 Leagues Beneath the Sea,"" and a character who sort of resembles ""The Invisible Man"" (but for reason of copyright isn't actually H. G. Wells's invisible man). There's also a surprise villain tucked inside. Heck, it's messy, but it's fun.There are some exciting action sequences, such as a shoot-out in an African plantation, a blazing fire-fight in a library, and a confusing but eye-popping attempt to stop the destruction of Venice. The finale goes all-out, and even if it doesn't always make sense, it's exhilarating nonetheless. And Sean Conne...well, he's just got the right moves for this sort of character and this kind of picture. He's a joy to watch.The extras are okay, nothing superb. The documentary is a bit patchy and oddly put together, but gives some interesting info on how the film was constructed in the Czech Republic. (It contains, however, nothing about the conflict between Connery and director Norrington, which would have been interesting to hear about). More data on the Victorian sources for the movie would have helped the viewer who hasn't read many of the original books.""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" despite what you may have heard, is really a fun time. No smash hit out of the park, but a solid double. And maybe it will get you interested in reading some of the source material. (I highly recommend ""King Solomon's Mines"" by H.

This is one of those films that comes ""oh so close"" to being solid but falls short because it's not character-driven enough.  With such a solid cast, it's a shame that the various members of the ""league"" didn't get enough of a chance to develop.  I suppose the viewer is supposed to be well-versed enough in 19th and 20th Century literature to know all about these characters, but that's too much of a stretch for me.  Sean Connery is great as Alan Quartermain, but the others characters (The Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde, Dorian Gray, Captain Nemo, etc.) get little more than glorified cameos.The movie is definitely ""heavy"" in computer generated effects.  Very realistic and convincing, but maybe a little too much over the top.  The decibel level from all of the gunfire, explosions, etc. will certainly give one's surround sound system a workout!  But don't get me wrong, the graphics ARE great, especially the depiction of Nemo's sub, The Nautilus!The plot is rather tepid and the average viewer will probably come away scratching his or her head somewhat about certain parts of it, but keep in mind that in is ""comic book material"" in general.  Suspension of disbelief will be needed to enjoy the film!!The movie is stylishly filmed and has some great scenery and locations.  It moves along at a rapid pace and there is very little down time in the film.  I'm choosing not to go into the plot in this review because too many earlier reviewers have done so.

613346,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005JM5B,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[5, 6]","Based on the graphic novels (i.e. comic books) created by writer Alan Moore and illustrator Kevin O'Neill, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) was adapted for the silver screen by James Robinson (Hot Wheels) and directed by Stephen Norrington (Death Machine, Blade).  The film features an interesting cast including Sean Connery (Dr. No, Highlander), who's also credited as one of the producers, Peta Wilson (""La Femme Nikita""), Tony Curran (Blade II), Jason Flemyng (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), Naseeruddin Shah (Monsoon Wedding), Stuart Townsend (Queen of the Damned), Shane West (Dracula 2000), and Richard Roxburgh (Van Helsing).The film, set in the year 1899, begins with a bang as we witness some mysterious assailants with German accents breaking into the Bank of England in a giant tank.  Next we see a zeppelin factory in Berlin assaulted by what appears to be British troops brandishing sophisticated weaponry.  As the various attacks continue Europe is thrown into turmoil as countries begin pointing the accusatory finger at each other.  Seems the British gooberment, believing an individual named The Fantom, who uses a Phantom of the Opera mask to conceal his identity, to be orchestrating the attacks, decides to assemble a team of extraordinary gentlemen (and a lady) including the following...hunter/adventurer Allan Quatermain (Connery), scientist/pseudo vampire Mina Harker (Wilson), sailor and inventor Captain Nemo (Shah), Rodney Skinner (Curran), who possesses the trait of invisibility, a snide, effeminate immortal named Dorian Gray (Townsend), and an American secret service goober by the name of Tom Sawyer (West)...oh brutha...anyway, after an run in with The Fantom, the group pops over to Paris in Nemo's ridiculously ginormous submarine called the Nautilus to gather a hulking Mr. Hyde, who, when in his non brutish form as Dr. Jekyll is played by Flemyng, finally setting sail for Venice, where a group of European leaders is set to gather offering a prime target for the villainous Fantom (seems The Fantom is interested in starting a world war so that he may profit from selling his fantastic weapons).  Anyway, the group manages to foil The Fantom's plans and avert a catastrophic disaster, but there's treachery afoot as one of the team members is a double agent, working with The Fantom, eventually escaping in Nemo's mini-submarine called the Nautiloid...that's cute...but not before seriously crippling Nemo's ship through some sabotage.  Soon after the group manages to get a line on The Fantom, following him to his secret base, which is actually a massive fortress somewhere in Mongolia, and learn the true nature of his nefarious plans along with his actual identity.I'm not familiar with the source material for this film, but I am a little familiar with some of Alan Moore's other works including V for Vendetta, which I thought translated into an excellent film, and Watchmen, which was in the process of being adapted to the screen but currently seems to be in limbo.  Given this familiarity, I got the impression the film strayed a bit, the focus on the special effects emphasized over the actual content within the source material.  Now generally films do lose something in translation (they're rarely as good as the books they're based), but in this case it seemed especially true...anyway, as far as the positives...the movie was very slick, the action sequences plenty, the performances relatively decent...and the negatives...the dialogue often felt goofy, the heavy reliance on computer generated effects grew tiresome (I thought the miniature work awesoma), and the characters had little substance.  I particularly despised the hokum, pseudo father/son relationship developed between Quatermain and Sawyer as it the more it grew, the more I gagged on its sickly sweetness (apparently Quatermain had a son-in-law who got killed under his watch, and now has found a sort of surrogate in Tom Sawyer...bleeech).  I thought Peta Wilson looked good (she actually looks better here with dark hair than her normal blonde) but I thought her character odd in that she was supposed to be a vampire, but had no difficulty venturing into the daylight.  Seems with what I know about vampires sunlight is especially harmful, with a special exception to Wesley Snipes character in the Blade films, but that seemed not the case here.  The silliest character, for me at least, was Hyde.  He was ridiculously huge, in league with Marvel's The Hulk...near the end there's a bit, without going too much into the story, where Hyde ends up fighting a misshapen Mega-Hyde, and things move into the realm of the asinine.  As far as the other characters, well, they were there I suppose...I found it difficult to root for these so called `heroes' mainly because they possessed little of the substance one would have expected from their namesakes.  Perhaps this was a case of trying to incorporate too many characters in a single film, and as a result most of them come off like cardboard cutouts, lacking various qualities necessary to flesh them out fully.  As far as the main villain, well, I thought his plan, as initially presented, an interesting one, but once his full plan (which included a number of aspects) was revealed it mired itself into convoluted mess, at least in terms of execution, specifically because it was dependant on elements which were out of his control.  I thought the `Fantom' persona unnecessary, overly cumbersome, and senseless in general.  I also thought, given the character's obviously extensive resources, it seemed foolish that he should always be in the middle of the action (and danger), especially since he had an army equipped with highly sophisticated weapons of mass destruction.  By the way, one might feel a certain sense of immunity having their secret hideout/fortress in a remote location, but that doesn't mean one should skimp on security measures.  The League showed up at The Fantom's door, knocked out like two guards, and they were in. just like that.  Oh well...all in all a there's a whole lot of colorful, farcical action throughout, but if you're looking for substance, given the abundance of so called literary characters, or something akin to Moore's original vision, you're probably going to be disappointed.The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) looks excellent, and the audio, available in 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround (English and French), and Dolby Digital Surround (Spanish), comes through most excellent.  As far as extras there's two commentary tracks, one with producers and cast members, and another with a number of crew members, along with 12 extended and deleted scenes, a behind the scenes documentary titled `Assembling the League' which provides a lot of `making of' materials, and subtitles in English and Spanish.  I dunno...seems kind of skimpy for a film that was as heavily promoted as it was prior to its theatrical release.Cookieman108A couple more things...I thought the film could have used a couple more comely females running around because as it stands, it kind of comes off as a sausage fest (and it's not like a couple extra characters would have hurt the film as it is).  Also, did anyone else who saw this have a hankering to yank on Captain Nemo's extraordinary long beard?  He kind of looked like the lost member of ZZ Top...",3,"""How many times do I have to kill these cretins?""",1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,7381,"['Based', 'graphic', 'novels', 'i.e', 'comic', 'books',

Well at least the people whom hate it can't agree on what makes it bad.... And I think that says a lot. The reviews that say the Quartermain character is a ripoff of Indiana Jones was particularly amusing since Lucas and Spielberg themselves state those flicks were based off the OG Quartermain character... Well that's what too much Eminem music and a lack of reading will do to you I guess.I keep hearing ""not enough characterization"", or ""too much characterization, I read all the books, I feel insulted!""Well, to put these main charcters from all the books into a movie, and to give a thorough rundown of each... Would make one of the LOTR extended cuts seem like a commercial break. And those who read all the books didn't take note that there are some differences from the OG sources... Namely the Invisible Man who in the movie states he's not the original one. So thoe ones at least should go back to the library!No one can agree on the CGI either... I'm still waiting to hear or read a universal agreement about the quality of CGI in a movie. Any movie that uses it there's always people that love it and hate it. IMO it looks about par for the course.I will agree on the too hectic editing in fight scenes. particularly the library one is bad. By the last third of the movie though they seem to have found a good pace.I haven't read the comics to fairly compare, but having read all the classics save for The Picture Of Dorian Gray (Which I will now be making a prority to read), I really liked to see these characters brought together like a superhero group in the vein of Justice League Of America or The Defenders... Calling it an Xmen ripoff is kinda wrong, considering none of these heroes are mutants. In fact at least a couple of them are probably too human for some to appreciate in this day and age.At best though LXG is a little bit above a mediocre action film.

613353,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00005JM5B,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[3, 4]","A superteam of fictional heroes taken from the works of H. Rider Haggard, Robert Louis Stevenson, Bram Stoker, Mark Twain, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and Oscar Wilde?  Sounds like it can't miss, especially when it's Allan Quartermain (q.v. King Solomon's Mines), Dr. Jekyll, Minna Harker, Tom Sawyer, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, and Dorian Gray.  On the other hand, it sounds like X-Men 1899, or should that be The Fantastic Seven?The year, 1899.  Tensions already hot between England and Germany due to the naval arms race (not mentioned, but something I thought I'd throw in, due to my knowledge), come closer to boiling point when a tank, similar to the ones that would be used in World War I, makes a raid on an English bank.  Germany is blamed.  A Zeppelin factory in Germany is attacked.  Naturally, Britain is blamed.  Worldwide consequences are foreseen, despite the fact that it's eight years before the formation of the Triple Entente.Allan Quartermain is dragged from the wilds in Kenya back to England and asked by a gentleman cryptically named M, to have a martini shaken not stirred.  Kidding, but think of the similarities between this M and another M in a series of movies starring Connery.  Anyway, this M resurrects the League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, comprising of unique personalities, to combat the villain, identified only as the Phantom.A lead takes them to Venice, courtesy of Nemo's ivory-coloured submarine, the Nautilus.  (Cue ""We all live in an ivory submarine"" haha).  Digital technology has to be commended for the realization of this nautical marvel.Connery puts his usual combination of charm, dignity, and toughness as Allan Quartermain.  However, given his employer's name, ""M"", I wonder if he felt more than a trifle of annoyance at the James Bond reference.  I'm not sure about Tony Curran playing the Invisible Man with some cheekiness.  However, Peta Wilson, exuding a calm beauty as Mina Harker is a surprise, playing Jonathan Harker's widow with restraint, that is until she gets stirred up and goes on a red-wine binge, vintage A, B, AB, or O.  She also becomes an object of attraction for the debonair Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), invulnerable because of... Oscar Wilde readers will know full well what I mean, and plain-speaking Tom Sawyer (Shane West).  West plays Sawyer as kind of a surrogate son for Quartermain.  And veteran actor David Hemmings (Barbarella, Blow Up, Deep Red) has a small role in the beginning as Nigel.  Jason Flemyng as Dr. Jekyll is interesting, as he has conversations with his CGI alter-ego.  Naseeruddin Shah plays the turbaned Nemo, resplendent in blue,  with an air of dignified leadership.Apart from the obvious inspirations, there is a nod to Victor Hugo's The Phantom Of The Opera and in a scene in Paris, Quartermain's mention of the police trying to catch an ape owes something to Edgar Allan Poe's ""Murders Of The Rue Morgue.""While not a bad yarn and an interesting concept to boot, I find its comparison to a 19th century version of the Marvel Comics heroes to be very derivative.  The action scenes still have that dizzying sound-and-fury effects that's become the norm in today's action movies.One positive thing I see about this movie is that it might get people to read the book from whence these characters came from.

613354,ATS7LYGLUX34L,B00005JM5B,Daniel V. Reilly,"[6, 8]","First off a small rant: Am I the only person sick of people posting reviews here of movies they haven't seen yet? As of this writing, there are six different reviews of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen on Amazon.com, and none of the reviewers have even SEEN the film. Wow. OK, on to the film! I've been a fan of Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neil's comic (On which the film is based) for years, so I had both high hopes and low expectations for LXG, as the abbreviation-crazy folks in Hollywood insist on calling it; After all, if Moore's groundbreaking graphic-novel From Hell could be so poorly served on film, what would become of the extremely literate League...?As it turns out, I was VERY pleased with the film, which doesn't so much adhere to the book as stay true to the feel of it. The book and film both concern a threat to the British Empire in the late 1800's that causes Her Majesty to gather a group of Heroes to counter the threat, all of whom are famous characters from Victorian-era literature. The characters who appear both in print and on film are Allen Quatermain, Mina Murray, Captain Nemo, Dr. Henry Jeckyll and his alter-ego Edward Hyde, and Hawley Griffin, The Invisible Man, who has been changed to Rodney Skinner, The Invisible Man, for the film, for some weird copyright reason. The film adds in Dorian Gray and Tom Sawyer, which may upset purists, but I actually thought they fit in quite well. The villain of the film is the mysterious, disfigured ""Fantom"", replacing the book's Fu Manchu, also presumably for copyright reasons. The source material is just crammed with Victorian literature references, so much so that a whole book has been published just for readers who want didn't get them all on their own. The movie also has a few literary nods, such as Nemo's First Mate Ishmael, but overall it never pretends to be anything other than what it is: A fun popcorn movie. The action scenes are fast-paced and well photographed, the plot moves along briskly and includes a few twists that should surprise even die-hard fans of The League's comics, and the effects are beautifully done; The depiction of Mr. Hyde is especially wonderful. If only The Hulk had looked so realistic...Sean Connery still makes a convincing action hero, and the rest of the cast all fill their roles ably, with Shane West (Tom Sawyer) and Stuart Townsend (Dorian Gray) standing out. Townsend is especially good as the foppish Gray. Despite cosmetic changes, such as changing the comic's all-too-human Mina Murray into a Vampire (Who seems to have no problem with sunlight...?), the film keeps the general feel of Moore's extraordinary (Pun intended) book, so overall, I'd say LXG is probably one of the best comic inspired movies I've seen in a long time, second only to Spider-Man. Newcomers to the world of The League should have a blast, and so will longtime fans (If they keep an open mind, that is.) Be on the lookout for the newspaper headline touting ""VOLCANOS ON MARS?"" in the background of the scene on the docks; The second comic book adventure of The League concerns H.G.

613355,A1HJZL0WKCOTSF,B00005JM5B,"Dan ""Longsword""","[14, 16]","Reminding you uncomfortably of ""Wild Wild West,"" an anachronistically modern action-adventure set firmly in the 19th century, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" assembles fantastic fictional personages of the Victorian era for an over-the-top visual-effects extravaganza.Star and exec producer Sean Connery is on hand to anchor the 1899 comic-book exploits with his formidable presence. Yet nothing anchors the lighter-than-air story as it drifts away under the direction of Stephen Norrington (""Blade"") into an FX stratosphere where wit, character and vigorous storytelling cease to matter. As an oddity -- a tentpole summer movie featuring characters more at home in a classic monster movie marathon on TV -- ""League"" might attract the under-25 crowd this weekend. But these MDCCCXCIX-Men are no X-Men.The gimmick here, courtesy of comic books by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, is to bring together an assortment of late-19th century fictional characters, the common denominator apparently being that they all have outlived copyright protection. So in the year 1899, Sean Connery's legendary British adventurer Allan Quatermain is summoned from his gin-sodden slumber in sleepy Africa by Her Majesty's government to defend the realm and Western world against an evil and mysterious Fantom.He is to recruit and lead a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which includes no gentlemen and one questionable lady. These are: Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), seen here as a Kali-worshipping Indian sea pirate outfitted with a ridiculous paste-on rabbi's beard; Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), wife to Dracula's discoverer, poor Jonathan Harker, now herself a full-fledged vampire; the Invisible Man's successor, Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), seen only when he dons clothes or smears his face with makeup; the immortal double bill of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng), where Mr. H. is deemed a creature not unlike the Hulk -- just not green; American secret agent Tom Sawyer (Shane West), who bears no resemblance to Mark Twain's character; and finally and most improbably, Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Oscar Wilde's vile yet ageless wonder. Do the filmmakers really believe the under-25 crowd knows the works of Wilde?The plot, an elusive thing constructed by James Dale Robinson, initially sends this gang of eccentrics off to Venice in Nemo's Nautilus submarine to save the city from destruction. For all their prowess, an hour into the film, Venice lies in ruins. (Question: Why destroy St. Mark's Square in 1899 with Hollywood special effects when we know it still stands in 2003?) The remainder of the movie gets spent in the frozen wastes of Mongolia, where weapons of mass destruction are being manufactured by the Fantom. (George W. Bush, take note!) It is here that the movie completely surrenders itself to the FX wizards at the expense of character, story and mood.The movie self-destructs before your eyes. If you are willing to buy a pre-Model T limousine in 1899 London, then this is your film. If lines like ""You're missing a picture, Mr. Gray"" seem the height of wit, then go for it. If having a multitude of celebrity creatures but not enough time to let them strut their stuff sounds like good planning, then by all means celebrate. Many viewers, though, may be discouraged at the empty stunts and effects, accompanied by a noisy, full-bore score, while good actors get lost in the chaos.

In this film, Connery plays a retired British explorer roped into preventing WW I by leading a team of misfits in a vaguely Bondian adventurer. As a nice twist, most of the misfits consist of 19th Century British villains such as Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, and Captain Nemo. Of course, no one bothers to explain why such villains would agree to unite for any cause other than, well, villainy. The film is comic book-y in a bad way, with ridiculous dialogue and a poor sense of continuity, and the effects are frequently unintentionally funny, especially Mr. Hyde's appearance. Connery makes the film work as a throwaway action film, but it's clear from the extras that the cast and some of the crew were deluded into thinking this was something more. Not surprisingly, this movie plays much better on DVD than it did in the theaters. If you're a die-hard Connery fan, you'll like this one.

Matrix 2 and HULK was this entertaining action movie that slipped in and out of theaters almost unnoticed in the summer of 2003.Taking its basis from the well known graphic novel of the same name this movie has a fascinating premise. What if the characters of Victorian literature were actually real people? What if technology that we take for granted now was suddenly thrust upon a world before their time. Thus, we have a bank robbery at the turn of the 20th century involving a tank. Machine gun toting villains tearing up an African country club. An automobile chasing through the streets of Europe and Jules Verne's Capt. Nemo (this time portrayed correctly as an Indian prince as he was in the novel) transporting our team of heroes in the submarine Nautilus.Leading the group though is H. Rider Haggard's adventurer Allan Quatermain  (played with spirit and gusto by Sean Connery). Also included among the ragtag group are the likes of the Invisible Man, Tom Sawyer (an addition to the cast of characters no doubt in an effort to help the movie sell to an American audience) and Dorian Gray.The team must race across the continent of Europe in an effort to defuse what is fast turning into a growing conflict between the Great Powers. The villain (the Fantom) has designs on making a boatload of money selling high-tech weapons (by 19th century standards) to the competing nations - or is he...there is a surprising twist to the story that eluded me until I checked out the special features.The narrative to this movie does seem a little muddled and at times it all appears a little too top-heavy with heroes. But if you take LXG (as it was called by Fox marketing) as a fun loving light hearted action adventure, and don't try and think it through too hard, then the movie can promise an entertaining evening.What this movie does provide is some great action scenes, an ingenious premise and Sean Connery.

Unfortunately that is often impossible. Movies and comics are separate art forms. In fact the only thing the comic and movie have in common is really the premise. Personally I view the movie and the comics separate. I liked it alot and thought it was very well done.

I did, however, find Tom Sawyer adorable and Dorian Grey drop-dead gorgeous.  Hyde was a low-budget Hulk and Jekyll was a tortured wimp who managed to come through when push came to shove.  The settings were not realistic looking, but I'd bet that has to do with the ""comic book"" feel of the movie.  There were a few funny bits, as when Captain Nemo's first mate said, ""Call me Ishmael,"" or when the secret service agent who called them together said, ""My superiors call me M,"" a reference of course to Connery's James Bond.  I think Connery followed well in the footsteps of the two previous Quartermaines that I've seen, Stewart Granger and, believe it or not, Richard Chamberlain, and I rather liked the Invisible Man.

I think the people responsible for this flick, needs to take that film and see literary fictional characters brought to ""life"" and how to handy a good fantasy Adventure.  The more I thought about it, the more I saw the films had a lot in common.  Won't blow the punchline, but if you have seen both films you will understand, they share a common character.I love Connery and REALLY wanted to love this film.  I can say I sort of liked it...but that is the strongest emotion evoked by the film, outside of confusion.  This movie had SO much going for it.  A super premise and the promise of a thinking-man's fantasy-adventure flick.  I mean I shall watch Connery in anything; he has a handsome and capable cast backing him, some great special effects...but someone needed to give them a road map!!It was written sharply, with good dialogue sprinkled here and there, and nice touches like the ""You may call me Ishmael"" the chauffeur.  Filmed with rich detail (a little darkly - sometimes you really had a hard time seeing what is happening!).  Movie opens in 1899 where London Peelers are being chased by a Tank.  Suddenly, the Bank of England is looted.  The Brits blame the Germans in ""pre war mentality"". But we know there is a criminal mastermind with futuristic toys and he is not playing fair.  Cut to a man calling himself M (double joke here!) recruiting Allan Quartermaine to head the League.  On the team is Mina Harker, the Invisible Man, Dorian Grey, Dr. Jekyll and his alter ego, Captain Nemo and Tom Sawyer.  Supposedly, some voodoo witchdoctor cursed Connery, and Africa will never let him die so, he, too share special powers.While the idea of superheroes from Literature coming together to battle the Phantom (whose real identity is elementary!)is engaging, there is no real set up for it happening - just IS.  Maybe they expect you to know from the comics?  Well, excuse me, there is a vast audience out there that does not!!  From that point on there is not pace, it is pedal to the metal now stop action.  The action is filmed great - even the car chase through Venice?? Highways?  I presume there was explanation for this that ended up on the cutting room floor.In the end, you are left going is that all there is?  Back to my original point, the seed is much like Young Sherlock Holmes, but there fantasy/fiction merger came to life with such brilliance.

I put this in my DVD player with all the negative critical reviews in mind, thinking I would then enjoy it more if I didn't expect too much.  No, sorry, this movie is poorly made comic book tripe.  The special effects are incredibly poor, looking more like video game nonsense than a big budget extravaganza.  When the Nautilus first rises and we are all supposed to be in awe of its immense size and grandeur, it looks more like a shiny toy on a blue screen.  Then there are the characters.  While I at first felt a kind of nostalgia at seeing the Insvisible Man, Dorian Gray, and Mina Harker from Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula,&quot; that feeling soon wore off and I was left with a motley cast spewing out one-liners and dumb babble.  Captain Nemo entering the picture was my first indication of downhill progress.  He looks and acts monumentally stupid, and is somehow able to perform martial arts like Jackie Chan.  Mr. Hyde is another poor creation, with obvious makeup effects and bad dialogue.  There are many plot flaws here, as well. The Nautilus, this huge vessel when first revealed, is then able to shrink in size and then traverse the narrow canals of Venice?  Mina Harker, a vampire, is standing in the daylight at the end of the film?  There were other scenes that were plugged in for time consumption.  One example is when Allan Quartermain is atop the Nautilus firing at red buoys being launched by Captain Nemo.  If there was ever a scene that needed to be cut, this was it.  The special effects are not special; the acting is okay in moments, but poor overall.

He didn't have to go the Donald Pleasence route and make a boatload of awful ""Halloween"" movies.

All of which begs the question:  Why in heaven's name would he associate his good name with a clunker that is THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN?But alas, it's all water under the Nautilus; Connery headlines this quagmire as slick adventurer Allan Quartermain (but it's still not as fun to say as Miss Moneypenney), out to save the world from certain doom in the last year of the 19th Century.  Yet Mr. Quartermain is not alone; he is aided and abetted by a passle of fictional characters who all lend instant credibility to the story:  Tom Sawyer, Captain Nemo, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll/Mister Hyde, Dorian Gray, and Mina Harker (of ""Dracula"" fame).No, I'm not making this up.  Somebody else did and made a bad movie out of it.  And would someone tell me how a ""league of extraordinary gentlemen"" would include a Mina Harker?  Does Bram Stoker know something the rest of us should know?But anyway, after what I thought was an absolutely sensational hook, this movie promptly dissolved into more nonsense than an ice fishing contest in the Everglades; nothing, and I mean nada, worked--from the special effects to the action sequences to the trite and sappy dialogue.

613374,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00005JM5B,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 4]","Don't quite give up on the comic-books-turned-movies franchises yet. If you're sick of the latest spandex hero fighting the forces of evil, LXG might give you a little refreshment. While deeply flawed in some areas, it's a lot more unique and possibly more entertaining. (Especially if you are a &quot;book&quot; person)It's 1899. A monstrous tank barrels through London and into a bank, where special diagrams are stolen. In Germany, Zeppelins are blown up. The world is on the brink of a widespread war, and a horribly scarred, masked Phantom is the one responsible. So the British government calls on Allen Quatermain (Sean Connery), a reclusive hunter with many amazing adventures behind him, and asks him to help England. He's about to refuse, but a firefight and a bombed-out club change his mind.He arrives in London to join the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), a vampire, an invisible thief, Skinner (Tony Curran), and Captain Nemo, a pirate (Naseeruddin Shah). They try to recruit Dorian Grey (Stuart Townsend), a beautiful and dissolute immortal, but are attacked in his home -- and aided by a young American agent, Tom Sawyer (Shane West). After recruiting Dr. Jekyll (Jason Flemyng) and his alter ego Mr. Hyde (also Jason Flemyng), the League is on its way to Venice, to protect an international conference from destruction by the Phantom. But the League soon learns that their situation is much more complex -- and that one of them cannot be trusted.To some degree, this movie is in a &quot;league&quot; of its own. Most comic books center on people given or born with extraordinary powers, but not much else. LXG, instead, focuses on characters who already existed, ranging from the bizarre (Mina the vampire, Dorian Grey) to the obscure (Allen Quatermain -- how many people reading this have read H. Rider Haggard?). As a result, it may be the only truly literary comic book adaptation. It's a motley crew, but somehow they fit. Unfortunately, while the literary references are solid enough, the plot is not really smart -- the good guys are hunting down the bad guy, who is trying to rule the world. It's fun if you switch off your brain and just watch.It can't be denied that the action scenes and fight sequences are amazing. Some of the characters are given more development, like Quatermain, who is still torn up over the loss of his son. For better-known people like Mina Harker (&quot;Dracula&quot;) and Tom Sawyer, not so much introduction is necessary. Not a huge amount of character development, but since these characters are already known to us, they feel good anyway. The identity of the Phantom (another literary character) is a genuine surprise (a good one, too), and the identity of the traitor becomes evident when you think carefully.Among the problems are the special effects -- Hyde's first scene is particularly bad, and some of the transformations are unconvincing. And some of the shots of the Nautilus and the tank (looked like a miniature), not to mention the flaming zeppelins, were very unconvincing. The first shot of the Phantom's fortress is enough to make you groan. That said, the follow-up shots of the fortress are lovely, and the Nautilus is (mostly) enticingly gorgeous and lush. (I want to live on the Nautilus -- that thing is absolutely beautiful)Connery proves that he's still a great presence at 70 plus. (He keeps beating up bad guys, and it never seems improbable) Wilson seems completely befuddled as to how to play Mina; Townsend is deliciously foppish and disdainful; Shah is likably dignified and solid; West is okay, not exceptional but not bad (he's at his best when bonding with Connery); Jason Flemyng is excellent as either incarnation of Jekyll/Hyde, switching between savagery and torment. And Curran steals every scene he's in -- or isn't in. Even though he's only a voice half the time, he's hilarious. (One of the funniest scenes is when Quatermain kicks the invisible Skinner out of his office)Despite the respectable and brainy background of these characters, LXG isn't a smart movie. It's not really dumb either. Consider it a James Bond movie if you took out Bond and populated it with classic characters.

It includes characters from Dracula, Dr. Jeykll &amp; Mr. Hyde, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Picture of Dorian Gray, etc.  The other characters were Captain Nemo, and a British big-game hunter living in Africa who is supposedly invincible, played by Sean Connery.

613379,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JM5B,Eric,"[2, 4]","During the summer of 2003, there were three movies in particular I was looking forward to: Terminator 3, Pirates of the Caribbean, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (hereto referred as LXG). The latter two, in particular, as both would be released in the same week and, from what I gathered in their respective trailers, harkened to the summer blockbuster I enjoy the most, the ""Spielbergian"" adventure.By that, I mean the grand escapism that was virtually created by Raiders of the Lost Ark, later to be surpassed only by its second sequel, The Last Crusade. As of right now, none of the Jones flicks have ever been matched in sheer exhilaration. I look upon the trilogy as the three greatest and most purely enjoyable action movies ever made. Pirates and LXG both seemed to be striving for the same sense of fun, and I watched the former film first, left bitterly disappointed (though it's not a bad movie and it's one I'll probably give another look), then decided for some down time before I'd see LXG, much of that having to do with the dreadful reviews it'd been receiving from even typically ""lenient"" critics (Berge Garabedian, AKA Joblo, gave it a 4/10).Having just seen it, I found myself surprised by some aspects and not so surprised by others. It's got a totally unspectacular story, sort of a James Bond-style plot about a madman who wants to start a world war so he can reap the profits. Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) is brought in to form an ""extraordinary"" team of unique individuals to stop the villain. Among the league include Tom Sawyer, the Invisible Man, Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, and Dorian Gray, the latter of whom being the only literary character I'm entirely unfamiliar with.LXG grossed just a little under 70 million dollars, and while not entirely a paltry sum, it's a lot less than I was expecting, even if the movie was as bad as most critics made it out to be. The trailers and concept, after all, wisely appealed to two crowds, Indiana Jones-style adventure lovers and superhero/comic book fans. I'm thinking, perhaps, the Indy crowd was turned off by the teamwork and special powers while the superhero crowd probably preferred their heroes more modern, or less ""literature-ish.""Whatever the reason, I'm sure LXG is still destined for a reasonably-sized fanbase in the years to come, whether or not it's actually deserving of it. When all is said and done, LXG is nothing more than a ludicrous movie that entertained me somewhat for the duration of its fairly short running time (which I'm a bit thankful for, after sitting through the bloated Pirates of the Caribbean). Though I realize the movie has its roots and origins in a comic book, there's a lot here that's difficult to swallow. Too much, in fact, but I'll give a few examples.For one, when it's discovered who the traitor is (spoiler warning), and it turns out it's the guy who formed the League in the first place, his reasons behind his actions make no sense. He claims he created the group so that he could steal their powers, but with the ""spy"" he had working for him, he could just as easily have accomplished his task without forming the league. Captain Nemo's submarine varies in size the same way Godzilla did, and the sub even manages to squeeze into the Venice canal. Connery's Quatermain is in amazingly great shape for a man of his age, able to leap off a moving car with no repercussions (and lands on his two feet without a hitch, no less!). Mina Harker, a vampire, is able to walk around in broad daylight.I realize these kinds of movies are made for pure, unpretentious fun, and LXG at least has the action and f/x to back it up. The film is packed to the brim with gun battles and all-out brawls, and despite way too much rapid cutting from director Stephen Norrington, the action scenes are pretty fun to watch, if never truly rousing in the same fashion all the action from the Indiana Jones trilogy was. I was also impressed by a lot of the visual effects, particularly the Mr. Hyde creation, which is as at least as convincing as the Hulk.Unfortunately, the cast mostly failed to impress me, probably the movie's damning fault. While Sean Connery is every bit as charismatic as ever, everyone else is clearly under his shadow. Only Shane West as the cocky, but likeable Tom Sawyer and Jason Flemying as Jekyll hold their own. Peta Wilson's Mina Harker is uninteresting, Stuart Townsend is what Johnny Depp would be if he were a bland actor (though, to be fair, Depp is a vanilla plain performer when he's playing non-eccentric roles), and Tony Curran's only noteworthy for sounding exactly like Jason Statham.I suppose, in the end, LXG is a reasonably fun, but singularly idiotic experience. With a better script, this could have been an adventure movie for the ages, not just a middling timewaster. As of now, I'm still hoping for the best from the soon-to-be fourth Indiana Jones film, which could bring the movie that brings that grand escapist Saturday Matinee style serial back into fashion.**

LXG was definitely the most underrated film of 2003 (along with HULK and THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS), and it deserved much better than it got.  One reason why I enjoyed this movie so much was because it's that kind of adventure we never get anymore: the Fantasy Adventure.  You know, like the INDIANA JONES trilogy, or THE MUMMY.  The very concept of mixing all these historic figures of literature and legend together I found very intriguing.  I've heard fans of the comic say that the movie completely destroyed what the comic did so well.  Well, since I've never even seen a single comic of LXG, the movie worked exceptionally well for me.I was so pleasantly pleased after watching LXG.  From all the horrible reviews it received, I wasn't expecting very much.  Just a big, dumb, stupid comic book movie.  Well, let me tell you, my expectations were completely blown away!  THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN is, in fact, a very well-done film, from the fine acting of its stars &amp; supporting cast, the awesome production design, the fantastic and mood-setting/tone-matching music by Trevor Jones, and the very treatment of the characters.  They're obviously altered from their original forms, but the actors and events never go so far as insulting the characters.  Rather, the film brings the heroes into new ground, and provides each one with new twists.  I found each of these twists highly entertaining (yes, even the turban-sprouting, kung-fu practicing Captain Nemo; I though it was fascinating how they showed him worshipping the god of death).  And of course, you have Sean Connery: THE MAN.Thankfully, director Stephen Norrington did a much better job with this than he did with BLADE.  I hear that he's going into independent films now, so knowing that, watching this film made it all the more interesting.Do yourself a favor and don't bother listening to the critics.  But don't go in expecting LORD OF THE RINGS, either.  Instead, go in expecting THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN to be a marvelous piece of entertainment, sure to become a cult classic as time goes by.

613381,A210LZST01NG7A,B00005JM5B,"E. S. Egertson ""comicking""","[2, 2]","The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is based in part on a Graphic Novel By Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill.  Rated PG-13.1) Actually, from reading the reviews posted previously, only some of the Characters and the name they take on are from the Graphic Novel.  If you're a fan of the comic, you'll be just as disappointed as those that expected more from The Hulk movie.  I haven't read the Graphic Novel, nor do I plan to.2) The movie brings together literary characters from books that were published between 1870 and 1897, and the story is based in the year 1899.  A mysterious villain known only as The Phantom is using relative high-tech gadgets to cause mayhem in the world in an attempt to cause a world war.  One man who calls himself ""M"" who we later find out is Professor James Moriarty (reference The Final Problem [Sherlock Holmes] by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 1893) recruits several people of extraordinary talent in an attempt  to stop this ""phantom"" menace (no pun intended).  He recruits Allan Quatermain (reference King Solomon's Mines by H. Rider Haggard 1885) whose name in the movie appears as Quartermain though is spelled correctly in the ending credits, Mina Harker (reference Mina Murray [Mrs. Jonathan Harker] from Dracula by Bram Stoker 1897), Captain Nemo (reference 20,000 Leagues Under The Seas by Jules Verne 1870), and an Invisible Man (reference The Invisible Man by H. G. Wells 1897) who is not the one from the book, but rather a thief who stole the invisibility potion.  These characters must then go recruit 2 more members for their League (Moriarty does not include himself in the League).  They visit Dorian Gray (reference The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde 1890) who is an immortal/invulnerable type person, and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde (reference The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by  Robert Louis Stevenson 1886).  Also brought into the mix for perhaps some flavor text is Tom Sawyer (reference The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain 1876), as he certainly brings nothing that makes him extraordinary other than he's another literary character from this time period.  The first step a viewer needs to do, is accept that however improbable or impossible it is that these characters could exist at the same time, let alone the same plain of existence, they do.  There are even references to other literary characters made that are not in the movie, such as Phileas Fogg  (reference Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne 1873).  The next step is to sit back and enjoy the movie.  I won't go into more as that might ruin the movie, but there is plenty of action and at least one plot twist that make this an enjoyable story.  While it is not  the biggest hit of the summer, it does provide plenty of entertainment.",4,Not for comic fans.. but for adventerous moviegoers,1058054400,"07 13, 2003",2003,2769,"['League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'based', 'part', 'Graphic', 'Novel', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'Kevin', ""O'Neill"", 'Rated', 'PG-13.1', 'Actually', 'reading', 'reviews', 'posted', 'previously', 'only', 'Characters', 'name', 'take', 'are', 'Graphic', 'Novel', ""'re"", 'fan', 'comic', ""'ll"", 'be', 'just', 'as', 'disappointed', 'expected', 'more', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Graphic', 'Novel', 'do', 'plan', 'to.2', 'movie', 'together', 'literary', 'characters', 'books', 'were', 'published', '1870', '1897', 'story', 'based', 'year', '1899', 'mysterious', 'villain', 'known', 'only', 'Phantom', 'using', 'relative', 'high-tech', 'gadgets', 'cause', 'mayhem', 'world', 'attempt', 'cause', 'world', 'war', 'One', 'man', 'who', 'M', 'who', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'Professor', 'James', 'Moriarty', 'reference', 'Final', 'Problem', '[', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', ']', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', '1893', 'several', 'people', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'attempt', 'stop', 'phantom', 'menace', 'pun', 'intended', 'Allan', 'Quatermain', 'reference', 'King', 'Solomon', 'Mines', 'H.', 'Rider', 'Haggard', '1885', 'name', 'movie', 'Quartermain', 'spelled', 'correctly', 'ending', 'credits', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'reference', 'Mina', 'Murray', '[', 'Mrs.', 'Jonathan', 'Harker', ']', 'Dracula', 'Bram', 'Stoker', '1897', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'reference', '20,000', 'Leagues', 'Seas', 'Jules', 'Verne', '1870', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'reference', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', '1897', 'who', 'not', 'one', 'book', 'rather', 'thief', 'who', 'stole', 'invisibility', 'potion', 'characters', 'must', 'then', 'go', 'recruit', '2', 'more', 'members', 'League', 'Moriarty', 'not', 'include', 'League', 'visit', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'reference', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', '1890', 'who', 'immortal/invulnerable', 'type', 'person', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll/Mr', 'Hyde', 'reference', 'Strange', 'Case', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'Robert', 'Louis', 'Stevenson', '1886', 'Also', 'brought', 'mix', 'perhaps', 'flavor', 'text', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'reference', 'Adventures', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Mark', 'Twain', '1876', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'extraordinary', 'other', 'literary', 'character', 'time', 'period', 'first', 'step', 'viewer', 'needs', 'do', 'however', 'improbable', 'impossible', 'characters', 'could', 'exist', 'same', 'time', 'let', 'alone', 'same', 'plain', 'existence', 'do', 'are', 'even', 'references', 'other', 'literary', 'characters', 'made', 'are', 'not', 'movie', 'such', 'Phileas', 'Fogg', 'reference', 'World', '80', 'Days', 'Jules', 'Verne', '1873', 'next', 'step', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'more', 'might', 'ruin', 'movie', 'plenty', 'action', 'least', 'one', 'plot', 'twist', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'not', 'biggest', 'hit', 'summer', 'provide', 'plenty', 'entertainment']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

But this film is somewhat of a dissapointment. It has 'extraordinary' flaws even a viewer can spot. It's frantic action from one scene to another provides us without a sense of logic for its characters.The characters, I should say, is lead by ageless Sean Connery. He commands a group of superheroes to fight a villian who wants to conquest earth. Some of the interesting heroes include Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde and a stunning vampiress. They're postively good, but don't have that much screen time. That's one of the flaws here. Again, the fast-paced action muddles throughout the film. The script, which makes a great movie, is a fault which the film can't correct. It just focuses on the action! The cast is almost a waste. Connery can't seem to break out and have fun. I guess his confrontations with director Stephen Norrington was a reason. He has no motivation.The visuals are somewhat fair. It was just uninspired. A good thing about this movie was the early 20th-century production design. The climax also is ineffective and leaves too many answers.

613389,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B00005JM5B,Get What We Give,"[1, 1]","In the superhero genre, this film scores a 4!Sean Connery, Peta Wilson, Shane West, Stuart Townsend, Richard Roxburgh, and Jason Flemyng almost jump out of the screen as some of literature's greatest heros (or villains depending on your take).  Based on a graphic novel of the same name, the film provides us with an introduction to each character as any good superhero film should and then WHAM! we're in the action!Don't make the mistake that many might - that this is an action film - because, while it has tons of action, this is a superhero film!  Back before there were comics, there were fantasy novels, science fiction, and horror.  It is this genre that this movie (and since I've not read the graphic novel - I'll assume it as well) mines for its characters and plotline.The time is 1899, and some meglomaniac is attempting to bring the world into a world war (remember the first world war began some 13 years later).  So the head of British Intelligence attempts to sign on Allen Quartermaine, the great explorer and adventurer as the leader of a group known as the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  The man who brings them together is known as ""M"".  (Now, this mere character name flashed brightly for me as it alluded to the current cinematic version of the British Secret Service overseeing James Bond - M.  Now, kids, anyone remember who played the first James Bond? - Can you say Sean Connery?).  I don't know how faithful this occurrance is to the books, but, man, it struck just the right note for me.Hesitant, Quartermaine agrees and we are quickly introduced to the rest of the League (and does this ""League"" name strike anyone as vaguely familiar to the ""Justice League"" of comic book fame?):  we have Stevenson's invisible man, Mina Harker from Stoker's Dracula, Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Well's Captain Nemo (really outstandingly fleshed out for us here), Wilde's Dorian Gray, Twain's Tom Sawyer are brought to life for us vividly.  The streets of London are brought to life wonderfully.I loved how the science fiction aspect was developed:  Captain Nemo is obviously a scientific genius and so he has advanced modern science on his own by creating an automobile (which were actually invented in around 1875 by Daimler Benz in Germany, but were not yet known widely) that looks like it belongs in the 1930's and a submarine which looks as if it is the size of the Titanic.  He also has heat seeking missiles on board the Nautilus.  This is all quite fantastic and farfetched - but HEY! - this is an action film of the superhero nature.Why these characters?  Quartermaine is undeniably the first ""Indiana Jones"" of literature.  Mina Harker is a brilliant choice, because she is a vampire - who can fly and transform herself - but one who can walk in the daylight. The Invisible Man is stealthy and ....invisible!  Dorian Gray - well he's indestructible - but he does have his Kryptonite.  Captain Nemo...well there's got to be a superhero who knows everything about everything, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde...well let me tell you that Robert Louis Stevenson wrote about ""The Hulk"" in the late 1800's - long before Stan Lee borrowed the concept for his comic.  Tom Sawyer?  He's the American version of Quartermaine and a crack shot.The acting is top notch and the storyline is really quite well developed.  I want to read the books, because I've got to believe Fox was somewhat faithful to them, because movie studios routinely screw up good literary stories when they put them to film.The special effects are awesome and the storyline really works.  I really loved who the villain turns out to be.  I'm not going to tell you, but do remember the characters are all from Victorian literature.Definitely go see this movie!  I fully intend to purchase this when it hits DVD.

When he finally arrives in London he finds that his fellow squad members are each gifted with unique talents.....and even darker secrets.  Reading like a Who's Who of 19th Century literature, Quartermain must deal with characters ranging from the never-aging Dorian Gray to the infamous Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  Given the unstable personalities, can this squad complete its mission...or will they turn on each other?  THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN takes this conceit and crafts a flick that, while short on depth, provides a non-stop ride of action and thrills.  Based on the now-classic comic book series by Alan Moore,  the film is wonderfully mounted and harkens back to the old days of 19th Century thrillers. The movie moves at a good clip and never drags as events move along.  Also, the special effects are very solid, with Captain Nemo's famous sub, the Nautilus, being the most impressive. By now, Sean Connery is an old hand at this types of roles, and he brings a delightful crustiness as the aging Quatermain. Stuart Townsend is delightfully snide as Dorian Gray, while Peta Wilson smolders with sexuality as the vampiric Mina Harker (the heroine from Bram Stoker's ""Dracula."")  Naseerruddin Shah is stern and stalwart as the legendary Captain Nemo.However, the movie isn't without its flaws.  Fans of the comics may find themselves disappointed, since the film substitiues a new plot for the comic's and only Shah's Nemo is true to the source.  Also, aside from Connery and Shah, the characters are pretty much one-demensional.  Indeed, the movie assumes that you already know the back stories of these characters.  As a result, if you haven't read the comics or the novels in which these characters appeared, you'd be at a disadvantage. Also, when Quartermain deduces the identity of the real villian near the end of the film, there's no real indication of where he got the knowledge.Overall, though, LEAGUE is a solid film that will appeal to the action-lover who takes his English lit with a sense of fun, and it's worth recommending if you have the right frame of mind.",3,"LEAGUE is a solid, if shallow, action flick",1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,2283,"['Years', 'prime', 'adventuring', 'days', 'Africa', 'great', 'hunter', 'Allan', 'Quartermain', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'recruited', 'British', 'government', 'lead', 'elite', 'squad', 'prevent', 'World', 'War', 'When', 'finally', 'London', 'fellow', 'squad', 'members', 'are', 'gifted', 'unique', 'talents', '..and', 'even', 'darker', 'secrets', 'Reading', 'Who', 'Who', '19th', 'Century', 'literature', 'Quartermain', 'must', 'deal', 'characters', 'ranging', 'never-aging', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'infamous', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'Given', 'unstable', 'personalities', 'can', 'squad', 'complete', 'mission', 'will', 'turn', 'other', 'THE', 'LEAGUE', 'OF', 'EXTRAORDINARY', 'GENTLEMEN', 'conceit', 'crafts', 'flick', 'short', 'depth', 'non-stop', 'ride', 'action', 'thrills', 'Based', 'now-classic', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'mounted', 'back', 'old', 'days', '19th', 'Century', 'thrillers', 'movie', 'good', 'clip', 'never', 'drags', 'events', 'move', 'along', 'Also', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'solid', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'famous', 'sub', 'Nautilus', 'being', 'most', 'impressive', 'now', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'old', 'hand', 'types', 'roles', 'delightful', 'crustiness', 'aging', 'Quatermain', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'delightfully', 'snide', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'smolders', 'sexuality', 'vampiric', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'heroine', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'Naseerruddin', 'Shah', 'stern', 'stalwart', 'legendary', 'Captain', 'Nemo.However', 'movie', ""n't"", 'flaws', 'Fans', 'comics', 'may', 'find', 'disappointed', 'film', 'new', 'plot', 'comic', 'only', 'Shah', 'Nemo', 'true', 'source', 'Also', 'aside', 'Connery', 'Shah', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'one-demensional', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'already', 'know', 'back', 'stories', 'characters', 'result', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'comics', 'novels', 'characters', 'appeared', ""'d"", 'be', 'disadvantage', 'Also', 'when', 'Quartermain', 'identity', 'real', 'villian', 'end', 'film', 'real', 'indication', 'where', 'got', 'knowledge.Overall', 'LEAGUE', 'solid', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'action-lover', 'who', 'English', 'lit', 'sense', 'fun', 'worth', 'recommending', 'have', 'right', 'frame', 'mind']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

613408,A2B0XO8BTPRX7R,B00005JM5B,Ian Vance,"[2, 2]","I knew what I was getting into when I agreed to view LXG with a couple of my friends.  I'd heard all about the tumultuous relationship between Sean Connery and director Stephen Norrington, and how the latter was locked out of the editing room when the film was being cut.  The slate of negative reviews the film received upon release - along with the not-encouraging fact that LXG had very little to do with its source material, other than the title, character-molds and a few recognizable symbolic props - made me avoid the film during its brief summer duration.  And yet when my friend ChefGeno mentioned that he'd rented it, on the strength of Connery's legendary status, I couldn't resist sitting down for the bumpy, frustrating, occasionally amusing ride with these penny-rate geriatrics of a century-past.  How wrong could Hollywood do it? Would LXG break the barrier from just plain `bad' to MST3000 hilarious?Considering the amount of times I smirked, chuckled, and shook my head in stunned disbelief, along with my rather bemused recollection of the whole experience the morning after, I'd say so.  For a film to reach that level of sublime incompetence, its intentions must be (somewhat) pure: the campy, convoluted result wholly unintentional from the original plan.  Then again, I'm not sure if Norrington, aware he had a stinker on his hands and that his development power would be taken away in the editing room, consciously decided to monkeywrench the film mid-way through - this being, IMO, the only logical reason behind some of LXG's creative decisions.To clarify:* Hyde: at first I thought of a man wearing really bad prosthetics.  Further inspection revealed it to be bad CGI pretending to be bad prosthetics.* Connery's Alain Quartermain, a hero in his 70's, jumps out of a car speeding at 80 miles an hour, and lands quite soundly and comfortably on his feet.* This same car manages to cruise through a good dozen stone columns without an apparent scratch or grumpy damage-snort; the passengers, exposed convertible-style, display a similar impervious nature to the rain of rubble/rain of gunfire.* Alain Quartermain has never driven a car, but when handed the wheel, he steers perfectly...and somehow manages to maintain an accelerating speed.* Upon sight of Nemo's Nautilus, my friend Dawn commented that it resembled a Chevy.* Nemo's costume is extraordinarily cheap looking, as are the submarine sets.  Nemo doesn't look (or sound) very Indian, and his stunt double fight scenes are comically blaxploitation-obvious.*The Invisible Man is able to survive high-mountain winter temperatures without wearing a shred of clothing, the only consequence of this action being a smarmy complaint about numb extremities.* Tom Sawyer: his inclusion to the League is an excuse to have a father/son relationship with Quartermain.  This sort of clich&eacute;d development doesn't tend to work, however, when it's left hanging after one scene.* Stuart Townsend: master of the smirk.  I offer nightly prayers to the almighty, thanking all manner of heaven and earth that this fellow was fired from LotR . . . a preening Aragorn we need not *ever* see! (though the inclusion of Dorian Gray was an unexpected treat).Connery's hand in the editing room is abundantly clear.  Certain transitions are unprofessionally rough.  Scenes progress with minimal information as to where the League is going, and why: the film moves along as quickly as possible, resulting in a loss of coherence.  Moments of conflict are often resolved speedily, without tangible logic.  The Venice Bombing scene stands out in particular - in the time-frame of mere seconds a plan is formulated and carried out henceforth, leaving the audience in the dust, scratching their heads and gaping at the sheer fantastical nonsense.The DVD my friend rented had a scratch, forcing us to skip half of a chapter - though not without any real detriment to our viewing `pleasure' - which in itself is telling about how involving LXG is.  This ultimately saddens me, for the source material *could* have been adapted faithfully, complete with Moore's outstanding dialogue and O'Niell's fanciful designs, at a relatively low budget - the appeal of the illustrated LXG being, after all, more about the characters and peculiarities of the time-period, rather than the empty fury of a hundred guns blazing or any other flashy theatrics an SFX team might splatter upon the screen.If *The Hulk,* with its Freudian angst and disturbing abuse subtext, alienated mainstream audiences from the hype-bubble of the comic-book film, then LXG served in bursting that fragile barrier wide open.  Yet in hindsight, I cannot say I regret watching this cinematic abortion of the first order.  LXG is awful, indeed, but at least it is _amusingly_ awful . . . and an honest chuckle at high-price floundering goes a long way in this day and age.",2,Without Rhyme or Reason: More Fodder for the

He has developed an armored tank impervious to any other weapon, smashed into a London bank, and captured blueprints for the city of Venice.  He wishes to destroy the city and the leaders of Europe who will be attending a conference hosted by the city.Meanwhile, a gentleman known as M (Richard Roxburgh) has recruited a group of legendary superheroes, including adventurer Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery), vampire Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), invisible man Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), immortal Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Tom Sawyer (Shane West), submarine commander Capt. Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), and Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde (Jason Fleming) to track down and destroy the mysterious Fantom.After arriving in Venice aboard Nemo's Nautilis, the group finds that the city is literally collapsing in on itself after several underwater bombs were detonated by the Fantom and his thugs.  The adventurers set off after the Fantom, only later to discover the Fantom's shocking identity.  This discovery throws everything into chaos, as the group struggles with what to do next.  Will the gentlemen succeed in saving Venice, or will the Fantom, who's true identity has been revealed, succeed in his devious plan?I thought this was a very good film.  I've always been a big fan of Sean Connery, and he does an excellent job as the legendary Quatermain.  The other actors in the movie give fine performances as well.

613423,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B00005JM5B,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[0, 0]","Director Steven Norrington did such a good job with Blade, that you would believe he would wrap this up with staunch precision.  Something went wrong in the mix.  Either there was a different Director of Photography, or producer or something.  There were many rumors of Sean Connery and Norrington butting heads on the set as well as the movie being delayed due to budget...but so was Blade.  Myself, I enjoyed it, to a point.  I thought the concept was facinating, if not simple; bring together characters from Victorian literature (extremely intresting) to battle a world power hungry villian (cliched).  The characters are good and most of them are well cast.  The father/son subplot between Quartermain and Sawyer is nice, but it is being beaten to death in many action movies these days.  The romance subplot between Harker and Gray is more instresting.  Although the special effects are good, it does seem like the budget ran low in some spots.  Don't nit pick this movie, the action scenes are good and the pace moves it right along in most areas and it is very entertaining.  But overall you're left with a sense of longing for character development.  As if something else was supposed to take place, but didn't.  But hey, it is just an action flick.  The cheezy ending may ruin it for some as well, if you are easily thrown off by one far fetched gesture.  I do recommend this one, but I would recommend another teams superhero movie more, X-2: XMen United which came out at the same time, had better reviews and made a lot more money.",3,Great Concept executed with too much ambition: 3 &amp; 1/2 Stars,1074729600,"01 22, 2004",2004,1544,"['Director', 'Steven', 'Norrington', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Blade', 'would', 'believe', 'would', 'wrap', 'up', 'staunch', 'precision', 'Something', 'went', 'wrong', 'mix', 'was', 'different', 'Director', 'Photography', 'producer', 'something', 'were', 'many', 'rumors', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Norrington', 'butting', 'heads', 'set', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'being', 'delayed', 'due', 'budget', 'so', 'was', 'Blade', 'Myself', 'enjoyed', 'point', 'thought', 'concept', 'was', 'facinating', 'not', 'simple', 'bring', 'together', 'characters', 'Victorian', 'literature', 'extremely', 'intresting', 'battle', 'world', 'power', 'hungry', 'villian', 'cliched', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'most', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'father/son', 'subplot', 'Quartermain', 'Sawyer', 'nice', 'being', 'beaten', 'death', 'many', 'action', 'movies', 'days', 'romance', 'subplot', 'Harker', 'Gray', 'more', 'instresting', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'seem', 'budget', 'ran', 'low', 'spots', 'Do', ""n't"", 'nit', 'pick', 'movie', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'pace', 'right', 'along', 'most', 'areas', 'very', 'entertaining', 'overall', ""'re"", 'left', 'sense', 'longing', 'character', 'development', 'something', 'else', 'was', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'action', 'flick', 'cheezy', 'ending', 'may', 'ruin', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'easily', 'thrown', 'off', 'one', 'far', 'fetched', 'gesture', 'do', 'recommend', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'teams', 'superhero', 'movie', 'more', 'X-2', 'XMen', 'United', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'had', 'better', 'reviews', 'made', 'lot', 'more', 'money']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I saw this film:  it had Sean Connery, and it was $10 for the blu-ray.  Two very good reasons for buying it.  Now, on another night, I might not have given it 5 stars, but it was raining, and I played the DVD.Now, I've read the 1- and 2-star comments, but I haven't read the book(s?), so I had no preconceived notions about what was ""supposed"" to happen.  I treated this film like many of the people who had never read Lord of the Rings treated the movie.  They didn't know what had been changed or left out or added, and they loved the movie.I really liked the film.  It was helped along by the blu-ray transfer and the extraordinary (pun intended) sound.  If you've got a great sound system, a quality blu-ray player, and an HD TV, this will always make a difference in the enjoyment.  Sean Connery was superb, as usual, and I enjoyed seeing all the other characters.  The movie had a lot of great qualities (sight and sound I've already mentioned):  a mission, betrayal, a lot of action, and Sean Connery.I'm sure there are those around who can talk about plot and advancement of the characters, but I really liked the characters.The Nautilus was one proud ship.  Now, I don't know who came up with the idea of the gigantic Hyde:  both Van Helsing and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen pictured him as such (and both made in 2003).  Before watching either film, I never thought of Hyde as an enormous Hulk.  So I don't know who to give credit for the mountainous Hyde.  I really approve of the presentation.I even liked the ending.  I would like a sequel, but after this amount of time, and I guess because of poor sales, there won't be one.

613428,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,B00005JM5B,jjceo,"[2, 2]","I like movies that involve people with super abilities and supernatural talents.  This movie sort of hit the warm spot in my heart with good entertainment and action at the same time.  It is based on a comic book series but the storyline has been changed and it is based in the late 1800's.  The super heroes are based on the characters developed by H. G. Wells, Bram Stoker, Jules Verne and many more famous authors so you have a combination of super heroes and villains.  It sort of uses an alternate history where the German soldiers are involved in a series of raids on both British and German facilities.  Someone is trying to start a war between Germany and Britain.  Alan Quatermain (Sean Connery) is reluctantly recruited to help find out what is going on and stop a potential war.A team of super powerful beings are recruited to investigate and solve the mystery.  That is where the real problems begin....This is a high action movie with a lot of good stars and the story line is that the super heroes are supposed to stop the bad guy from conquering the world.  The special effects are pretty good and some of the actors did a very good job in their roles.

613433,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B00005JM5B,"John ""MovieAddict""","[4, 8]","With Sean Connery appearing in roughly one film per two years, one would think he has the time, or at least would take an interest in choosing quality work. But alas, we are subjected to ""The Avengers,"" one of - if not the - worst film of the decade...and now...this? Hardly a bad motion picture, but then again, hardly an Academy Award Winner.Believability isn't this film's strongest trait. I came close to recommending it a few times - I really did; I wanted to - but there was a particular scene involving a car chase through the streets of Venice (streets that, like the film critic Roger Ebert stated, do not even exist) that literally insulted my intelligence - at least, what little intelligence I have. I may not be the smartest person but by George I think that a bit more confidence in the audience's knowledge is in store.Keep in mind that the year is 1899 - automobiles have hardly been invented - yet we are shown one zipping around at not 100 miles per hour, through streets that never - and don't - exist, past guards who can't seem to be able to shoot a cat off a flea's back at two yards, and through pillars and windy little crevices and who knows what else; and all the while this vehicle is being driven by a young American not twenty-four years old. I'm the last person to complain about believability - but this even pushed it for me. And I'm the guy who recommended ""Commando.""Ah, yes, there is a plot behind this mess, but not a very smart one at all. Sean Connery plays Allan Quartermain. With the intended audience of this film obviously being little kids and rednecks living in their parents' basement in Louisiana with fourth grade educations (you know who you are), perhaps the filmmakers thought that they could dupe everyone into believing that Allan Quartermain is responsible in part for the creation of the quarter. Heck, for the heck of it, let's just say he is - we can't screw up facts any more than they already are!Quartermain is like the father of Indiana Jones - oh, wait, didn't Connery play that part already? He's a legendary adventurer responsible for renowned events around the world - events never ventured into whatsoever. An emissary from England mentions he is the role model for all little boys and the focus of all their stories. Perhaps he meant to say the laughing stock. Who knows?No, seriously, Quartermain has been invited to join ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman,"" a league of gentlemen with extraordinary powers - ironically one is a woman. Perhaps a more appropriate - and yes, more marketable - title would have been ""The League of Extraordinary People Which May or May Not Include Hot Women."" It sure would be more marketable to the male teenagers out there, wouldn't it?Also in the team are such daring and wonderful characters as Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah - say it ten times fast), a retired pirate; Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), a she-vampire; Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), a British pickpocket with an obviously low IQ but yet a man who managed to dabble in invisibility, hardly an easy subject for those with simple minds, with strange results; Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), who you may remember is the man who remained at ease with his conscience through incidents relating to a portrait of his soul; Tom Sawyer (Shane West), one of them thar' American folk; and last, but certainly not least in terms of mass, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng and The Incredible Hulk), who bears a striking resemblance to both The Hulk and the nightclub gorilla from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988) when morphed.There are a lot of mistakes in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman,"" and not all of them have to do with geographical or factual errors. First of all, the characters from classic fiction are totally f****ed up. Since when was Dorian Gray invincible? In one scene he comes up with bullet holes through his body and he never even flinches. As far as I knew his mind was at rest with his actions in Oscar Wilde's classic tale, and his age remained permanent, but he was hardly ever indestructible; and the thing that got me the most was Mr. Hyde. Having read Robert Louis Stevenson's truly wonderful tale, I felt cheated by the character shown here - he looked like Shrek and a giant gorilla's offspring. Only uglier. I always got the idea from Stevenson's text that Mr. Hyde was a bit of a shy, awkward, short character who lurked in the shadows and had a disfigured face - this Mr. Hyde is just another special effects extravaganza who gets to wipe out hoards of enemy soldiers like bowling pins with one mighty swing of a forearm. And since when did he get to choose when he wanted to turn back into Dr. Jekyll? I always assumed it happened involuntarily...To be honest, this isn't a terribly bad film, but there are a few low-points that, if they were combined together without the stretches of ""okay-ness"" in between, would result in one of the most horrific films of the last two decades. The movie insulted my intelligence many times, particularly with the Venice car chase, which played out more like a testosterone junkie's videogame dream rather than anything more intelligent. And then there are the disgraceful reinventions of some of the most beloved of all characters.""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" boasts some extraordinary visual effects, but the rest of the film is anything but extraordinary. And I really felt cheated when I realized that Mr. Hyde was a big Hulk who could change back and forth voluntarily just like the former rather than being the darker, more disfigured character Stevenson envisioned. Some day they should get a good modern remake of the book with just enough visual effects to make him look terrifying but still somewhat human. In the meantime, the director of ""The Extraordinary League of Gentlemen,"" Stephen Norrington, may soon be receiving a phone call from Stan Lee.",2,Not So Extraordinary...,1069977600,"11 28,

613434,A638BD7GOG321,B00005JM5B,Johnny Anarchy,"[1, 2]","Having read the comics on which this film was based I already knew this movie had enormous shoes to fill. Having heard that it was going to become a ""Summer Flick"" I became even more wary. Hearing that it was being referred to and ""posterized"" as ""LXG"" (how un-Victorian can you get?)I became even MORE wary. Then when I saw the trailer I became absolutely horrified by what I saw.Then I went and saw it. Hey, I never said I was smart.Did I find it absolutely terrible? No. It was just a little below fair...and in my opinion that is the worst place for a movie to be. If it is terrible it still (depending on what kind of movie buff you are) has the capacity to entertain you. ""LXG"" offers nothing new to the Action/Adventure genre on top of being a lousy adaptation of a damned in depth and entertaining comic.While the comic series focuses on the idea of ""What would the world be like if the stories found in old fantasy/sci-fi/adventure novels and ""penny dreadfuls"" were actually true?"" and interweaves minor characters from any number of books among the main characters the movie on the other hand doesn't concern itself much with this...only content on throwing people one or two bones in this regard. What the movie is more concerned with is throwing in cliched anachronisms not seen since the seemingly more ambitious Wild Wild West.You will be amazed by machine guns in the 19th century! Tanks! And...a psuedo-Victorian/1930's looking car!""I call it an 'automobile'"". -Captain Nemo, LXGAnd I call it groan worthy.I could point out the horrid effects and whatnot but in the end...if a movie has a good story with good characters the ""specialness"" of the effects wouldn't really matter all that much. The fact that you register that the effects are seriously lacking is a result of the fact that everything else is just as bad or worse.This is no slight to the actors of course for the most part but a slight to the dialogue they have to spew out. Sean Connery is enjoyable to watch no matter what he is in, though more and more lately his real life ""crotchety old Scot"" seems to be oozing out of his performances more and more. I also found myself liking the guy that played Captain Nemo...aside from the producer's/writer's/director's idea that he should use martial arts.Yeah.Short story long...if you are a fan of the literary works that are vaguely referenced in this movie and you made the serious mistake of seeing this film I must suggest you check out The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen vol. 1 and 2. In Alan Moore's work there you will be dizzied by the amount of literary references there as well as wildly entertained. I would hate to think this movie would dissuade you from that. If you are an action/adventure movie aficienado as I am, you still won't be impressed. Nothing in this movie hasn't been done before, trust me.In the end, you would probably be a lot better off reading a book.Any book.",2,"Elementary, Dear Watson...",1121385600,"07 15, 2005",2005,2922,"['Having', 'read', 'comics', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'already', 'knew', 'movie', 'had', 'enormous', 'shoes', 'fill', 'Having', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'become', 'Summer', 'Flick', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'wary', 'Hearing', 'was', 'being', 'referred', 'posterized', 'LXG', 'how', 'un-Victorian', 'can', 'get', 'became', 'even', 'MORE', 'wary', 'Then', 'when', 'saw', 'trailer', 'became', 'absolutely', 'horrified', 'what', 'saw.Then', 'went', 'saw', 'Hey', 'never', 'said', 'was', 'smart.Did', 'find', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'No', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'fair', 'opinion', 'worst', 'place', 'movie', 'be', 'terrible', 'still', 'depending', 'kind', 'movie', 'buff', 'are', 'capacity', 'entertain', 'LXG', 'nothing', 'new', 'Action/Adventure', 'genre', 'top', 'being', 'lousy', 'adaptation', 'damned', 'depth', 'entertaining', 'comic.While', 'comic', 'series', 'idea', 'What', 'would', 'world', 'be', 'stories', 'found', 'old', 'fantasy/sci-fi/adventure', 'novels', 'penny', 'dreadfuls', 'were', 'actually', 'true', 'interweaves', 'minor', 'characters', 'number', 'books', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'concern', 'much', 'only', 'content', 'throwing', 'people', 'one', 'two', 'bones', 'regard', 'What', 'movie', 'more', 'concerned', 'throwing', 'cliched', 'not', 'seen', 'seemingly', 'more', 'ambitious', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West.You', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'machine', 'guns', '19th', 'century', 'Tanks', 'psuedo-Victorian/1930', 'looking', 'car', 'call', ""'automobile"", '-Captain', 'Nemo', 'LXGAnd', 'call', 'worthy.I', 'could', 'point', 'out', 'horrid', 'effects', 'whatnot', 'end', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'characters', 'specialness', 'effects', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'much', 'fact', 'register', 'effects', 'are', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'result', 'fact', 'everything', 'else', 'just', 'bad', 'worse.This', 'slight', 'actors', 'course', 'most', 'part', 'slight', 'dialogue', 'have', 'spew', 'out', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'matter', 'what', 'more', 'more', 'lately', 'real', 'life', 'crotchety', 'old', 'Scot', 'be', 'oozing', 'performances', 'more', 'more', 'also', 'found', 'liking', 'guy', 'played', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'aside', ""producer's/writer's/director"", 'idea', 'should', 'use', 'martial', 'arts.Yeah.Short', 'story', 'long', 'are', 'fan', 'literary', 'works', 'are', 'vaguely', 'referenced', 'movie', 'made', 'serious', 'mistake', 'seeing', 'film', 'must', 'suggest', 'check', 'out', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'vol', '1', '2', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'work', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'dizzied', 'amount', 'literary', 'references', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'wildly', 'entertained', 'would', 'hate', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'dissuade', 'are', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'aficienado', 'am', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'impressed', 'Nothing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'before', 'trust', 'me.In', 'end', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'off', 'reading', 'book.Any', 'book']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
613435,A2AEITFD4X19LP,B00005JM5B,Johnny O,"[3, 8]","I had been waiting for this movie for sometime.  The original comic book was great, and i was glad to see it adapted into a movie.  Unfortunately, this movie has some problems.  First, let me proclaim some level of unbias, as i really wanted to enjoy this movie, despite whatever changes, new characters or plot adjustments they had made.  In the end, all my problems with this movie were simply poor movie making.First though, a synopsis: This is the justice league of america for the 19th century.  Characters from classic literature brought together to fight a common evil.  Alan Quartermain, 'Mina Murray (from Dracula), Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, Captain Nemo (from 10,000 leagues under the Sea) and two characters that weren't in the original story, Tom Sawyer and Dorian Gray.  Together, they are thrust into an array of adventures as they try to foil the sinister plot of one uber criminal, The Fantom.So here is just one of my many problems with this movie, Tom Sawyer.  His adventures with Huck Finn and the slave Jim, obviously took place pre-cival war, where Sawyer was in his early teens.  This movie takes place in 1899, which means Tom Sawyer should be in his 40's or even 50's, but no, he's 20-ish.In the end, this movie has an ego problem.  It thought it was going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but falls short.  The characters are two dimensional, its dialogue gets sophomoric at times, the villain when finally revealed and his evil plans are just too ridiculous.  It is a shame that Hollywood could take an idea so grandiose and turn it into utter rubbish.  Although, there is something inspirational about a movie like this, if Hollywood will make a movie this bad, anyone can write a successful script.",1,Start Writing,1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,1752,"['had', 'been', 'waiting', 'movie', 'sometime', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'great', 'i', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'adapted', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'problems', 'First', 'let', 'proclaim', 'level', 'unbias', 'i', 'really', 'wanted', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'changes', 'new', 'characters', 'plot', 'adjustments', 'had', 'made', 'end', 'problems', 'movie', 'were', 'simply', 'poor', 'movie', 'making.First', 'synopsis', 'justice', 'league', 'america', '19th', 'century', 'Characters', 'classic', 'literature', 'brought', 'together', 'fight', 'common', 'evil', 'Alan', 'Quartermain', ""'Mina"", 'Murray', 'Dracula', 'Dr.', 'Jeckyl/Mr', 'Hyde', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Captain', 'Nemo', '10,000', 'leagues', 'Sea', 'two', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'original', 'story', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Together', 'are', 'thrust', 'array', 'adventures', 'try', 'foil', 'sinister', 'plot', 'one', 'uber', 'criminal', 'Fantom.So', 'here', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'problems', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'adventures', 'Huck', 'Finn', 'slave', 'Jim', 'obviously', 'took', 'place', 'pre-cival', 'war', 'where', 'Sawyer', 'was', 'early', 'teens', 'movie', 'place', '1899', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'should', 'be', '40', 'even', '50', '20-ish.In', 'end', 'movie', 'ego', 'problem', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'greatest', 'thing', 'sliced', 'bread', 'short', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'dimensional', 'dialogue', 'sophomoric', 'times', 'villain', 'when', 'finally', 'revealed', 'evil', 'plans', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'shame', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'take', 'idea', 'so', 'grandiose', 'turn', 'utter', 'rubbish', 'something', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'make', 'movie', 'bad', 'anyone', 'can', 'write', 'successful', 'script']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Allan Quartermain is hired with other illustrious name to form a team to thwart a menace that threatens the world.  The team includes Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde and the invisible man (but not the original).  They are later joined by Tom Sawyer and Dorian Gray.  They must stop a madman from plunging the world into war.The adventure carries them to Venice and Russia.  They must face their foe as well as treachery from many angles.  Each brings their own special talents to bear.  Plot and counter plot are revealed amid much action and daring-do.  As is typical it all comes down to a final showdown between heroes and bad guy although there is a very nice twist at the end.Fans of the original comic may hate this movie.  The characters have been greatly changed.  Mina is no longer in charge and has some new abilities.  Quartermain is his younger self.  The invisible man is a thug who stole the formula.  Sawyer is brought in to add a little American taste and Dorian Gray is added.  I am still not sure after several watchings why the League was formed.  The villains goals could have been reached without creating the formidable force.  Seeing the gigantic Nautilus navigate the canals of Venice was quite humorous.  I also wasn't aware that one could race a huge car clear across Venice.  Nemo claimed the invention of the automobile although they already exited at the time the movie is set.  Many of the flaws stem from the creators just not being familiar with the characters they were dealing with.

As it is, LXG is an interesting movie, but what annoys me greatly is the fact that it has an enormous potential, which was not developed correctly.The basic plot may be the oldest in the world, but still effective: a madman is trying to dominate the world by means of kidnapping the foremost scientists on Earth and making them develop futuristic weapons like armored cars and repetition rifles (remember, the time is 1899, when the wars were fighted in trenches). To prevent it, enter the scene six or seven of the most known heroes in the british world (and one from the American scene too): an elderly but still tough Allan Quatermain, Dorian Gray, Captain Nemo and his Nautilus, the Invisible Man, Mina Murray (ne&eacute; Harker, from Dracula), Tom Sawyer and Dr. Jeckyll/Mr. Hyde.OK this is a work of fiction with super heroes, so I won't comment on the plot premises. They are far-fetched and unbelievable, but it's very cool to watch a bunch of my favourite characters together trying to stop a world-domination plot. I will post, however, some questions: 1) why the presence of an american character, if in Moore's story there are no Americans? I think the american audience can stand a movie with no american heroes, if the story is good. The way it is, all non-american viewers get a little angry with Sawyer's presence in the story. And all that talk when Sean Connery (the ultimate british actor) says to Sawyer that ""this new century will be yours, as the old one was mine"". C'mon. I know the producers will say it's the american audience thay will make the movie pay-off, but with such a poor story this one will hardly pay-off anyway. And 2) if they wanted to create Nautilus THAT huge, at least they should know that a thing that size wouldn't fit in Venice's narrow and shallow channels. The Nautilus design was cool but I don't buy a ship over a kilometer in lenght traveling smoothly between the gondolas.Well, there were other things that made me role my eyes, but what I want to say to future viewers is that LXG is one nice super-hero movie. Surely not great, but surely watchable with some dark interesting scenes, good computer-animated sequences and above-average graphic design.

It seems somewhat crammed together and I agree with other reviewers that some of the characters seemed forced on the viewer.  Connery does a good job here, but I think that he could have done much better with a stronger script and a better supporting cast.  The Invisible Man is likeable, and Dorian Gray is one of the better nasties I've seen in awhile.  Peta Wilson as Mina Harker doesn't add up for some reason.  There are a lot of holes in her character and while I'll look beyond the fact that she could walk around in daylight, I can't get over the feeling that the character is just a jumble of stereotypical heroines.  Jekyll/Hyde was pretty good, but his character didn't seem to belong here.  It's almost as if he was thrown in so that there would be a big guy in the group.  Tom Sawyer was useless in this flick, excepting that he replaces Quartermain's deceased son.  Captain Nemo was stale.  His character never really caught my attention.Even though I'm throwing out a lot of negatives, this story is action-packed.  It moves at a breakneck pace and leaves you little time to catch your breath.  As far as visuals go, this movie is tops.  But that might be the biggest problem.  Too much time seems to have been spent on impressing the audience with special effects instead of story development.  Sadly, that has become commonplace in today's action yarns.Overall, this movie is okay.  It isn't too great, but you won't feel that cheated of your time after watching it.  It's no-brainer visual fun.  If you want a better period action piece, watch &quot;The Mummy.&quot;  The story and acting are much better.",3,"Watchable And Fun, But Not Outstanding",1081123200,"04 5, 2004",2004,1693,"['quot', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'quot', 'decent', 'flick', 'somewhat', 'crammed', 'together', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'characters', 'seemed', 'forced', 'viewer', 'Connery', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'stronger', 'script', 'better', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'likeable', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'one', 'better', 'nasties', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'Mina', 'Harker', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'reason', 'are', 'lot', 'holes', 'character', ""'ll"", 'look', 'fact', 'could', 'walk', 'daylight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'feeling', 'character', 'just', 'jumble', 'stereotypical', 'heroines', 'Jekyll/Hyde', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'belong', 'here', 'almost', 'was', 'thrown', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'guy', 'group', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'was', 'useless', 'flick', 'excepting', 'Quartermain', 'deceased', 'son', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'was', 'stale', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'caught', 'attention.Even', ""'m"", 'throwing', 'out', 'lot', 'negatives', 'story', 'action-packed', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'little', 'time', 'catch', 'breath', 'As', 'far', 'visuals', 'go', 'movie', 'tops', 'might', 'be', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'impressing', 'audience', 'special', 'effects', 'instead', 'story', 'development', 'Sadly', 'become', 'commonplace', 'today', 'action', 'yarns.Overall', 'movie', 'okay', ""n't"", 'too', 'great', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cheated', 'time', 'watching', 'no-brainer', 'visual', 'fun', 'want', 'better', 'period', 'action', 'piece', 'watch', 'quot', 'Mummy.', 'quot', 'story', 'acting', 'are', 'much', 'better']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

This did nothing for the story at all. Mina, an English woman who survived Dracula is turned into Amazonesque woman with what sounds like a Swedish accent. Mina is also a full fledged day walking vampire in the movie. In the book she is not. In the book Mina and Quartermaine (played by the always sexy Sean Connery) are intensely attracted to one another despite their age difference.In the movie Mina is messing around with Dorian Gray who doesn't even appear in the book. The Invisible Man is wildly different from the character in both the comic book and the original novel. Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde are, at least, handled  mostly true to the comic book though the movie gives no indication about how Hyde feels about Mina.

613454,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,B00005JM5B,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[12, 14]","Q:  What do you get when you create a story based on teaming up the combined talents of heroes born of many of the world's most famous literary classics of the past, including H Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines, Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea, H.G. Wells' The Invisible Man, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, Robert Louise Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and Herman Melville's Moby Dick?A:  A ripping good yarn. But you also inherit a minefield by borrowing from so many loved literary classics.A ripping good yarn is the way that the big-budget, popcorn action film The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen should be approached. It is a highly entertaining, rip-roaring tale exploring the fantasy of what might have been possible had all these extraordinary fictional characters been able to team up for a common purpose. The thought that these characters were originally created of completely different time periods and not of the same collective fictional universe should be left behind. This film is not meant to be taken too seriously - it is purely and simply a bit of fun. Unfortunately though, many critics have panned the film outright by seizing on numerous inconsistencies in the portrayal of these classic literary characters as not being completely authentic to their original authors. I can appreciate from a literary sense where these critics are coming from and can understand why this film irks those who love the classics. But still, one should hardly expect that a story idea based on bringing together such a highly fanciful collaboration of all these characters will result in anything other than an excuse to have a bit of fun. Viewed with this overriding goal in mind, once you allow your criticism of minor inconsistencies of the character portrayals to be suspended, The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen delivers on the fun scale in spades.The fun thing about this film is that you don't have to have read all of these literary classic to enjoy the movie. There are many ""in-references"" inserted throughout to cater for those who have an appreciation of the abovementioned novels and others including the works of Ian Fleming and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but certainly the movie can be appreciated as a stand-alone experience even if you only know some or few of these works. As an aside, the fact that the film tries to be rather cute in playing to the intelligentsia of its audience with its many deliberate ""in-references"" is only problematic, given that those same audience members to whom such references are aimed will also by corollary tend to be the same people who care enough about the classics to highlight the resultant inconsistencies in the character treatments. I think this, more than any other reason, is ultimately why The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen failed to impress the critics more than it did; you simply can't have your cake and eat it too.The storyline is very well thought-out, if not arguably a bit too rushed for my liking, with a large amount of story and action crammed into a 110 minute film. The plot is premised around cramming in as much action into the story as possible, with every hero given a chance to shine in their turn. This is also a big-budget action film, so the production values are high, particularly in aspects such as the attention to detail in the character costumes. The special effects are also, for the most part, great - it's just a pity that only one or two dodgy effects shots stand out to prove an exception to a great job (these one or two shots being suboptimal only due to the lack of time available to complete them before the theatrical release date (the usual story)). The acting in this film is certainly rock solid, and this is particularly the case - yet again - with Sean Connery. Can this man do nothing wrong in the acting stakes?

Allan Quatermain; the greatest hunter who ever lived, leads a team of unique individuals to try to prevent global war.  They're certainly interesting people, too.  An invisible man, Captain Nemo, Henry Jeckel and Edward Hyde, Mina Harker, Dorian Grey, Tom Sawyer...As I look at the roster, I can't help but wonder how it could have been any better.  After all, using Sherlock Holmes might have overshadowed the other characters.The movie itself has excellent special effects, superb acting and scriptwriting that is some of the best I've ever seen (we're talking Star Trek; The Next Generation quality.)  The characters are right on the money in both attitude and dialogue and if you're familiar with more than one of them, you're going to find this film to be a real treat.Sean Connery (the big name of this movie) is an over-the-hill actor, so it makes sense that he play the role of an over-the-hill hero.  This he pulls off most admirably.  The others are just as good at acting, though somewhat less renowned for it.  Furthermore, the action is not constant, but considerable enough to be a real rush nonetheless, and wherever there isn't action, there's character-interactions that are truly awesome.There were only a few things I could spot in this movie that could have been done better.  First, the main bad guy didn't get to use enough of his remarkable skills.  Secondly, when the main bad guy first appeared, his general attitude seemed almost mockingly cheesy, which I suppose was his intention.  Lastly, the character of the invisible man wasn't the original, like in the comic, and to be honest, I wish he had been.  The name &quot;Griffin&quot; just seems to belong with the Invisible Man, though to be fair, they did a decent job making Rodney Skinner act roughly like him.As I said, I can't see why people don't like this movie.  I actually thought it was, in most ways, better than the comic, and I've seen it four times already, on the big and small screens.  If you're a literature buff, this is a movie for you.  If you don't like the characters, you might not get as much out of the movie, but you should still enjoy it.  If you're a hardcore comic fan, you might not enjoy the movie at all just because it's different from the comic, but remember; the comic took a lot of liberties that this movie actually hit closer to the mark on.  That's my thoughts on the movie, and I hope it compells you to at least RENT it, if not get it.",4,Why does everyone trash this movie?,1081900800,"04 14, 2004",2004,2484,"['idea', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'Allan', 'Quatermain', 'greatest', 'hunter', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'team', 'unique', 'individuals', 'try', 'prevent', 'global', 'war', ""'re"", 'certainly', 'interesting', 'people', 'too', 'invisible', 'man', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'Henry', 'Jeckel', 'Edward', 'Hyde', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'Dorian', 'Grey', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'look', 'roster', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'using', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'might', 'have', 'overshadowed', 'other', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'superb', 'acting', 'scriptwriting', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'quality', 'characters', 'are', 'right', 'money', 'attitude', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'more', 'one', ""'re"", 'going', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'real', 'treat.Sean', 'Connery', 'big', 'name', 'movie', 'over-the-hill', 'actor', 'sense', 'play', 'role', 'over-the-hill', 'hero', 'most', 'admirably', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'acting', 'somewhat', 'less', 'renowned', 'Furthermore', 'action', 'not', 'constant', 'considerable', 'enough', 'be', 'real', 'rush', 'nonetheless', 'wherever', ""n't"", 'action', 'character-interactions', 'are', 'truly', 'awesome.There', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'things', 'could', 'spot', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'First', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'use', 'enough', 'remarkable', 'skills', 'Secondly', 'when', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'first', 'appeared', 'general', 'attitude', 'seemed', 'almost', 'mockingly', 'cheesy', 'suppose', 'was', 'intention', 'Lastly', 'character', 'invisible', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'original', 'comic', 'be', 'honest', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'name', 'quot', 'Griffin', 'quot', 'just', 'belong', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'be', 'fair', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'making', 'Rodney', 'Skinner', 'act', 'roughly', 'him.As', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'most', 'ways', 'better', 'comic', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'four', 'times', 'already', 'big', 'small', 'screens', ""'re"", 'literature', 'buff', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'characters', 'might', 'not', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'should', 'still', 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'hardcore', 'comic', 'fan', 'might', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'just', 'different', 'comic', 'remember', 'comic', 'took', 'lot', 'liberties', 'movie', 'actually', 'hit', 'closer', 'mark', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'hope', 'least', 'RENT', 'not', 'get']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[2, 3]","Bearing in mind that prior to watching this film at a theater back when it was first released that I'd never heard of any comics or any other series named &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentleman, I went and watched this fairly good film with an open mind and enjoyed it and was looking forward to its eventual release on DVD.  Having now watched this film twice; I would definitely have to say that this film is entertaining and quite intriguing in its plot.  I imagine I can say that as I know little of the comics so I don't have the first clue what the director and screen writers did or didn't do to the originality of the series.  Having said that, I would temper it with the fact that just as in the case of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and many other examples, they &quot;can't always put it on the screen as it was in the book or in this case comic book(s).&quot;Among the better aspects of this film were the dark undertones that seem to be quite prevalent in newer films these days.  While many may lament over the script or characters or what have you, I also found the pacing of this Sci-Fi/action film to be quite good!Performance wise, all of the actors did a very good job with this film.  One thing you can always count on in a film with Sean Connery's named attached to it is an outstanding performance by him and he definitely does that with this film.This is the first film I've watched a film that Stephen Norrington has directed and I would definitely have to say, based on this film that it would be interesting to go back and see some of his earlier films and to keep an eye out for his future films.The Premise:It is the year 1899 and someone appears to be making all attempts to instigate world war by committing terrorist acts against the governments of several key nations, all the while disguised as the opposing nation.  In comes the call to Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery) by the Crown, to help organize the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and seek out whoever is organizing these acts and neutralize them.What follows from there is a fairly good Science Fiction/action film in which several &quot;heroes&quot; and not so heroic personalities form the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and go on an adventure to stop this terrorist.I would definitely recommend this film to any and all who are interested in well written, well paced Science Fiction/action flicks that involve some very familiar names.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Full Length Audio Commentary (Producers/Actors)-Full Length Audio Commentary (Costume/Makeup/Visual Effects Team)-&quot;Behind-The Scenes&quot; Documentary-12 Deleted Scenes",4,TLoEG - This film is actually pretty interesting!,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,2648,"['Bearing', 'mind', 'watching', 'film', 'theater', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'comics', 'other', 'series', 'named', 'quot', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentleman', 'went', 'watched', 'fairly', 'good', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'eventual', 'release', 'DVD', 'Having', 'now', 'watched', 'film', 'twice', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'entertaining', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'imagine', 'can', 'say', 'know', 'little', 'comics', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'first', 'clue', 'what', 'director', 'screen', 'writers', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'originality', 'series', 'Having', 'said', 'would', 'temper', 'fact', 'just', 'case', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'quot', 'many', 'other', 'examples', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'put', 'screen', 'was', 'book', 'case', 'comic', 'book', 's', 'quot', 'better', 'aspects', 'film', 'were', 'dark', 'undertones', 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'prevalent', 'newer', 'films', 'days', 'many', 'may', 'lament', 'script', 'characters', 'what', 'have', 'also', 'found', 'pacing', 'Sci-Fi/action', 'film', 'be', 'quite', 'good', 'Performance', 'wise', 'actors', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'always', 'count', 'film', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'named', 'attached', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'definitely', 'film.This', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'Stephen', 'Norrington', 'directed', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'say', 'based', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'earlier', 'films', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'future', 'films.The', 'Premise', 'year', '1899', 'someone', 'be', 'making', 'attempts', 'instigate', 'world', 'war', 'committing', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'governments', 'several', 'key', 'nations', 'while', 'disguised', 'opposing', 'nation', 'call', 'Allan', 'Quartermain', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Crown', 'help', 'organize', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'seek', 'out', 'whoever', 'organizing', 'acts', 'neutralize', 'fairly', 'good', 'Science', 'Fiction/action', 'film', 'several', 'quot', 'heroes', 'quot', 'not', 'so', 'heroic', 'personalities', 'form', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'go', 'adventure', 'stop', 'terrorist.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'paced', 'Science', 'Fiction/action', 'involve', 'very', 'familiar', 'names', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Full', 'Length', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'Producers/Actors', '-Full', 'Length', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'Costume/Makeup/Visual', 'Effects', 'Team', 'quot', 'Behind-The', 'Scenes', 'quot', 'Documentary-12', 'Deleted', 'Scenes']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I intend to have my children take me to see the movie for my birthday and will write a review at that time.  This is a rant (with a touch of raving) about the ad campaign that 20th Century Fox has put together for this film.I have seen the teaser for this film and at least two different trailers, including the most recent one to make its appearance on television.  Clearly, the main selling point for the film is actor Sean Connery, and that is not something about which I would be inclined to complain.  However, here is a film that can easily be sold to the public in a sentence or two that would run essentially as follows:""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" brings together the ""original"" superheroes of late 19th-century fiction: Allan Quartermain, Mina Murray Harker, Captain Nemo, the Invisible Man, and Dr. Jekyll (and his alter ego Mr. Hyde.Now, that was based just on my having read all of the comic books by Mr. Alan Moore & Mr. Kevin O'Neill.  Clearly the film version is doing some tinking with the lineup: Dorian Gray has been added and apparently Dracula's bite had an effect on Mina.  But even the most recent trailer, which talks about ""VAMPIRE"" and ""BEAST"" and such, STILL does not mention who these characters are and that this is not just any invisible man but the creation of H.G. Wells.Ironically, Connery's character is the least recognizable of the bunch since H. Rider Haggard's ""She"" and ""King's Solomon Mine"" have not had the cinematic exposure of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" let along ""Dracula.""  Maybe the explanation for this simplistic and stupid ad campaign is that nobody in Hollywood has read let alone heard of those original novels and think that Oscar Wilde writes British drawing room comedies.But what I know is that every time I have explained to somebody WHO those characters are in the action-packed and pretty confusing trailer for ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" that their interest in seeing the film has at least DOUBLED.  Even if you have only seen the trailers and have not read the comic books, I think you can see the validity of my point.Will 20th Century Fox get its act together and put out an intelligent trailer before the film opens on July 11th?  Will Allan Quartermain and his associates be able to save the Empire for her majesty Queen Victoria?

Based on the celebrated graphic novel by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, the film combines the Gothic splendor of Victorian 'penny dreadfuls' with the excesses of modern Hollywood, resulting in a curious hybrid of ""Boy's Own"" adventure story and turbo-charged blockbuster (set-pieces include a spectacular recreation of Captain Nemo's 'Nautilus', the sinking of Venice, and several destructive rampages by the hulking Mr. Hyde!), though the mixture of styles never seems forced or arbitrary, thanks to a clever script by James Dale Robinson (COMIC BOOK VILLAINS).An unusual cast of veterans and newcomers is toplined by Connery, who coasts through proceedings on the strength of his established screen persona, while everyone else is upstaged by scene-stealer Stuart Townsend (QUEEN OF THE DAMNED), playing Dorian Gray as a dandified nobleman, bored with his immortality and contemptuous of the world around him, whose skirmishes with vampire/ex-girlfriend Mina Harker (Peta Wilson, TV's ""La Femme Nikita"") are charged with sexual tension - these characters surely deserve a movie of their own! Sadly, the film is undermined by a lackluster 'surprise' villain, miscast and misconceived, whose lack of visual presence leaves a significant hole in the narrative. However, despite this minor drawback and some well-documented production troubles (Connery and director Norrington were at loggerheads throughout), the finished article shows no signs of on-set problems, and is much better than its modest box-office performance would otherwise suggest.",3,Gothic splendor and Hollywood excess,1077148800,"02 19, 2004",2004,2273,"['LEAGUE', 'OF', 'EXTRAORDINARY', 'GENTLEMEN', 'USA/Germany/Czech', 'Republic/UK', '2003', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '2.39:1', 'Panavision', 'Theatrical', 'soundtracks', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '/', 'DTSToward', 'end', '19th', 'century', 'Prof.', 'Quatermain', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'recruited', 'lead', 'band', 'superheroes', 'drawn', 'popular', 'literature', 'day', 'blessed', 'distinctive', 'powers', 'defeat', 'monstrous', 'villain', 'who', 'plotting', 'take', 'over', 'world.Clearly', 'riding', 'coat-tails', 'successful', 'superhero', 'movies', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'DAREDEVIL', 'X-MEN', 'Stephen', 'Norrington', 'high-concept', 'melodrama', ""'all-star"", 'cast', 'characters', '19th', 'century', 'fiction', 'reconfigured', '21st', 'century', 'audiences', 'weaned', 'likes', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'Superman', 'mythos', 'Based', 'celebrated', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'Kevin', ""O'Neill"", 'film', 'Gothic', 'splendor', 'Victorian', ""'penny"", 'dreadfuls', 'excesses', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'resulting', 'curious', 'hybrid', 'Boy', 'Own', 'adventure', 'story', 'turbo-charged', 'blockbuster', 'set-pieces', 'include', 'spectacular', 'recreation', 'Captain', 'Nemo', ""'Nautilus"", 'sinking', 'Venice', 'several', 'destructive', 'rampages', 'hulking', 'Mr', 'Hyde', 'mixture', 'styles', 'never', 'forced', 'arbitrary', 'thanks', 'clever', 'script', 'James', 'Dale', 'Robinson', 'COMIC', 'BOOK', 'VILLAINS', '.An', 'unusual', 'cast', 'veterans', 'newcomers', 'toplined', 'Connery', 'who', 'proceedings', 'strength', 'established', 'screen', 'persona', 'everyone', 'else', 'upstaged', 'scene-stealer', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'QUEEN', 'THE', 'DAMNED', 'playing', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'dandified', 'nobleman', 'bored', 'immortality', 'contemptuous', 'world', 'skirmishes', 'vampire/ex-girlfriend', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'TV', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'are', 'charged', 'sexual', 'tension', 'characters', 'surely', 'deserve', 'movie', 'own', 'Sadly', 'film', 'undermined', 'lackluster', ""'surprise"", 'villain', 'miscast', 'misconceived', 'lack', 'visual', 'presence', 'significant', 'hole', 'narrative', 'However', 'minor', 'drawback', 'well-documented', 'production', 'troubles', 'Connery', 'director', 'Norrington', 'were', 'loggerheads', 'finished', 'article', 'signs', 'on-set', 'problems', 'much', 'better', 'modest', 'box-office', 'performance', 'would', 'otherwise', 'suggest']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Now, I'm not very familiar with the comic book so I don't know how true this is to the material, but this film's weakest points are the script, which is terribly silly and pointless, and the horrible special effects.  The action scenes were clumsy and you don't find any big suprises out of this film.The actors range from good to bad.  Sean Connery's a great actor, but he's just not believable as Quartermain because of his age.  He seems too old to be able to do the physical things he can.  Tony Curran is never given a chance to make us like his character.  Skinner's a jerk most of the time and going back and forth between an actor in makeup and CGI effects is tedious.  Naseeruddin Shah, as Captain Nemo, is fun to watch, but his fighting abilities seem a little hard to swallow.  He's one of the better characters in the film.  Peta Wilson does a fine job as Mina Harker.  Her character is one you're really able to like.  Stuart Townsend is great as Dorian Gray.  He pulls the role off very well and has some pretty good lines.  Shane West is good enough to make us like Tom Sawyer.  He's got some really cool moments.  Jason Flemyng is perfect as Dr.Jekyll, though the Hyde character looks really stupid(Facial expressions and deformations all over him.)Overall, I'd say see it at least once.

613468,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JM5B,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 0]","Once again we have the temptation to compare the book to the movie, which I will succumb to just a little. Books and movies are different media, and each brings its own strengths to art. Such is the case here. The book was full and lengthy and while it brought the same breadth of characters, it was able to provide a broader background for each of the characters. There were some spots where I thought the book was just a bit fuzzy on the plot, but I loved the style.The movie provides more visuals, but with a two-hour length it had to cut back on the length of background for the characters. The movie glossed over some of the darker aspects of the characters, particular Alan Quatermain, but enhanced others, particular the background of Mina Harker. The other strange addition was that of the character of Dorian Gray. I also objected to the change in the invisible man character from the book to the movie. I much preferred the book's Hawley Griffin as the invisible man versus Rodney Skinner, who supposedly stole the formula. Griffin was a much stronger, more tormented character, though his characterization would require more film time to establish and would likely have weakened the roles of the primary actors.In terms of characterization, Sean Connery clearly shined as Quatermain, as he always seems to do in every role. Peta Wilson is excellent as the sultry, dangerous Mina Harker. Naseeruddin Shah as Captain Nemo returns Nemo to his original characterization by Verne as a Sikh. Shah's Nemo was a welcome variation to previous Nemos, providing a sense of command, control and honor in comparison to those others who sometimes seemed simpering and typically talked far too much for Verne's Nemo. The other actors have insufficient screen time to fully flesh out their roles, partially because of the large number of lead characters.The plot itself is a bit of a muddle. It's difficult to follow the progression and contrivances that lead from point-to-point. Often the logic is non-existent, and the viewer is left to wonder how they knew they were headed the right direction other than a trite explanation by one of the lead characters. Had the movie been extended by another 15 or 20 minutes many of the incongruities could have been reduced and the story flow could have been smoothed. To try to minimize the various confusions: Essentially the story is about a group of sort of good guys out to stop a definite bad guy from conquering the world, except the bad guy has been cleverly manipulating the sort of good guys all along and has a nefarious reason (of course) for doing so.The special effects end up providing much of the focus of the movie in lieu of a more coherent plot. Some of the special effects are very good, such as the bizarre image of the Nautilus sailing the canals of Venice. The destruction of Venice by underwater bombs is mundane by today's standards. The other special effects vary in their quality and effect on the viewer, but are generally good. As noted before, the special effects often substitute for plot.Though some of my criticisms are not encouraging, I actually liked the movie. As a B movie it is okay. Clearly not in the league of movies such as the Lord of the Rings, it is nonetheless a rousing adventure. In general the movie rates 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 stars because of the three actors that really made this movie for me: Connery, Wilson and Shah.",4,Interesting Though Uneven (For Sony PSP),1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,3417,"['Once', 'again', 'have', 'temptation', 'compare', 'book', 'movie', 'will', 'succumb', 'just', 'little', 'Books', 'movies', 'are', 'different', 'media', 'own', 'strengths', 'art', 'Such', 'case', 'here', 'book', 'was', 'full', 'lengthy', 'brought', 'same', 'breadth', 'characters', 'was', 'able', 'provide', 'broader', 'background', 'characters', 'were', 'spots', 'where', 'thought', 'book', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'plot', 'loved', 'style.The', 'movie', 'more', 'visuals', 'two-hour', 'length', 'had', 'cut', 'back', 'length', 'background', 'characters', 'movie', 'glossed', 'darker', 'aspects', 'characters', 'particular', 'Alan', 'Quatermain', 'enhanced', 'others', 'particular', 'background', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'other', 'strange', 'addition', 'was', 'character', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'also', 'objected', 'change', 'invisible', 'man', 'character', 'book', 'movie', 'much', 'preferred', 'book', 'Hawley', 'Griffin', 'invisible', 'man', 'versus', 'Rodney', 'Skinner', 'who', 'supposedly', 'stole', 'formula', 'Griffin', 'was', 'much', 'stronger', 'more', 'tormented', 'character', 'characterization', 'would', 'require', 'more', 'film', 'time', 'establish', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'weakened', 'roles', 'primary', 'actors.In', 'terms', 'characterization', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'clearly', 'shined', 'Quatermain', 'always', 'do', 'role', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'excellent', 'sultry', 'dangerous', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'Naseeruddin', 'Shah', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'Nemo', 'original', 'characterization', 'Verne', 'Sikh', 'Shah', 'Nemo', 'was', 'welcome', 'variation', 'previous', 'Nemos', 'providing', 'sense', 'command', 'control', 'honor', 'comparison', 'others', 'who', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'simpering', 'typically', 'talked', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Verne', 'Nemo', 'other', 'actors', 'have', 'insufficient', 'screen', 'time', 'fully', 'flesh', 'out', 'roles', 'partially', 'large', 'number', 'lead', 'characters.The', 'plot', 'bit', 'muddle', 'difficult', 'follow', 'progression', 'contrivances', 'lead', 'point-to-point', 'Often', 'logic', 'non-existent', 'viewer', 'left', 'wonder', 'how', 'knew', 'were', 'headed', 'right', 'direction', 'other', 'trite', 'explanation', 'one', 'lead', 'characters', 'Had', 'movie', 'been', 'extended', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'many', 'incongruities', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'story', 'flow', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'smoothed', 'try', 'minimize', 'various', 'confusions', 'Essentially', 'story', 'group', 'sort', 'good', 'guys', 'out', 'stop', 'definite', 'bad', 'guy', 'conquering', 'world', 'bad', 'guy', 'been', 'cleverly', 'manipulating', 'sort', 'good', 'guys', 'along', 'nefarious', 'reason', 'course', 'doing', 'so.The', 'special', 'effects', 'end', 'up', 'providing', 'much', 'focus', 'movie', 'lieu', 'more', 'coherent', 'plot', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'such', 'bizarre', 'image', 'Nautilus', 'sailing', 'canals', 'Venice', 'destruction', 'Venice', 'underwater', 'bombs', 'mundane', 'today', 'standards', 'other', 'special', 'effects', 'vary', 'quality', 'effect', 'viewer', 'are', 'generally', 'good', 'noted', 'special', 'effects', 'often', 'substitute', 'criticisms', 'are', 'not', 'encouraging', 'actually', 'liked', 'movie', 'B', 'movie', 'okay', 'Clearly', 'not', 'league', 'movies', 'such', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'nonetheless', 'rousing', 'adventure', 'general', 'movie', 'rates', '3', 'stars', ""'m"", 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'three', 'actors', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'Connery', 'Wilson', 'Shah']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
613469,A1H3ZATBDMOJ6Z,B00005JM5B,Louis Barbarelli,"[3, 6]","LXG starts well with a spectaclar scene involving Alan Quatermain's reluctant re-entry to Her Majesty's Service.  The excitement continues as the members of the LXG have their initial meeting and are subjected to their first attack as a team.  But it's all downhill from there.  Even the special effects seem to get faker as the film progresses.  The Invisible Man is sometimes CGI, sometimes a live actor with powder on his face and the obvious inconsistency in appeance is glaring and inexcusable.  Captain Nemo's submarine is not half as impressive as the one in the Disney film ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,"" which was made FIFTY years ago.  Inside LXG's sub, the chandaliers in the dining room don't even sway as the sub maneuvers and you rarely have the feeling in interior shots that you're in a sub.The characters are potentially interesting, but the movie's execution and script are so sloppy, the characters'potential is never realized. And why would Dorian Gray keep his eyes open when shown that portrait since he knows what will happen?  Why does the invisible man disappear, not only in the obvious sense but from the movie, for an hour with no credible explanation?  What is the significance of Captain Nemo's strange religious inclinations?  Why does Nemo's beard look like it's about to come unglued at any second?I'm aware that there were conflicts between Connery (the producer) and the director, Stephen Norrington, and there were natural disasters.  It shows.  But all this movie proves is that modern special effects can look lousier than the plastic models used in the 1950's.  Oh, it also proves that Peta Wilson makes a sexy vampire.

613474,A17NVM7IAPF2NS,B00005JM5B,Maek,"[0, 1]","This film is an absolute mess.  The one redeeming quality is Sean Connery's acting and charisma, but there is NOTHING else here.Sean Connery seems to have thrown his lot in with some extremely lack-luster talent here.  Granted, I can see why some women find Stuart Townsend pretty, but every role he's in seems to place a rather smug ""Gosh, I know I'm beautiful"" look on his face.  I mean, Dorian Gray...an IMMORTAL?  Please.Mina-the occasional vampire lady-seems on the verge of evoking some sort of emotion, but just can't get past the costume.  One laughably memorable moment is where she looks frightened in the car as Dorian jumps off to supposedly attack some bad guys.  A few seconds later, she positively growls something to the effect of, ""These men are mine!"" whilst launching herself into attack.  Fear...anger...whatever.  It's in the script, right?Jekyll/Hyde...I won't even go there.  And the Invisible Man was too smarmy for my taste.Despite the lack of talent, there may have been some room for good story, character development, etc., but there's nothing there either.  The evil Phantom wants to take over the world, or some foolish nonsense of the sort, and there are plot twists and double-crosses that perhaps an 8-year old might be taken aback with a childish, ""I didn't see that coming, Daddy!""  Funny, the rest of the adult audience could see a lot of this nonsense straight off the bat.One prime example of where character development fails centers around the loss of Sean Connery's son in the film, but even the Phantom's taunting doesn't even get a rise out of him.  The American who is oh-so-obviously-a-detached-replacement-of-a-son hardly conjures any tears, sympathy, or any emotive response for that matter.Effects.  Special effect-wise, you can see why this movie was made because this movie seems to be nothing but.  No CGI in the world can save a bad movie and this is one shining example.Skip it.

613475,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00005JM5B,magellan,"[3, 3]","This is one of those movies that falls into the category of guilty pleasures. It's just fun, mindless entertainment, and in today's increasingly ludicrous world which has seemingly become a race to the bottom in virtually every area of life, anything that can take your mind off of your everyday troubles is welcome. Works for me.The movie deviates from the book in several ways, but if you're not a stickler for that you'll enjoy the movie, which has enough action, special effects, and plot twists to keep up your interest from beginning to end. The basic idea behind the movie, which is very creative, is bringing together a number of legendary fictional characters on a secret quest to save the world from an evil genius who of course would be the legendary Dr. Moriarty of Sherlock Holmes fame.The main difference between the film and the book was the addition of the Dorian Gray character, but he added a lot to the movie with his fine characterization so that I didn't mind, and in fact all the characters (which include the Invisible Man, a female vampire, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hide, Tom Sawyer, Captain Nemo, and of course Quatermain), all do a great job in their roles. In fact the whole cast seems to be having a good good time playing all these famous and interesting characters.Visually, it's a great looking movie: the Victorian ambience, from the manners the actors display to the costumes to the impressive sets and backgrounds, really seem authentic. A reviewer commented that the special effects were about average for a movie these days, but I thought they were quite good. I note that Roger Ebert pretty much hated the movie for various reasons (he gives it one star) but I liked it but I have no pretentions as a learned movie critic. Captain Nemo's submarine for one is spectacular and really adds to the movie, although some of its technological capabilities (it has guided missiles in 1899) are obviously unrealistic, but again, that's part of the fun.The locales range from Kenya, England, Paris, Venice, and even northern Mongolia. (It was actually filmed in Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Malta). Although the movie was largely panned by critics, it was an international financial success.

The commercials looked lame and centered on Sean Connery's Schwarzeneggerian bon mots and special effects. Even the title, later acronymed to ""LXG"", cried out poseur.When Connery's Alan Quartermain boasted ""I'm waiting to be impressed"" during the exposition I was sure I had my opening line for this review. Perhaps it was my low expectations, or maybe some unexpectedly decent filmmaking (or, to quote Grandpa Simpson, it was possibly ""a little from column A, a little from column B""), but I kind of liked this movie.Although it is based on comics deity Alan Moore's book of the same name, the story is sort of screwy at points. And the plot hole involving (no pun intended) the Invisible Man's disappearance was deeper than the Chunnel. But, having checked my disbelief at the door, I sat back on my old blue plaid sofa and enjoyed 110 minutes of goofy fun.It is 1899 and a crazed mask-clad villain is wreaking havoc in Europe. Quartermain is asked by the English government to lead a group of odd heroes to save the day.Odd indeed. Dorain Gray, The Invisible Man, Mina Harker, Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde and Tom Sawyer all join forces to foil The Phantom's plot.It turns out in the end that The Phantom, later revealed as Holmes' archenemy Dr. Moriarty, was the very person that had assembled the League for his own nefarious purposes.Pretty standard superhero stuff, but the look of the film is really what elevates the material. The design of Nemo's Nautilus is stunning. Every time it was on screen I found myself marveling at it. The costumes were wonderful too. I especially liked The Invisible Man's somewhat pointy hat.The special effects are also very nice. The Invisible Man's face painting was a wonder, and the flashy jump cut transformations back and forth between Jekyll and Hyde were simple but elegantly effective.Even some of the trite writing eventually appealed to me. Nemo's first mate introduces himself to the group by asking them to ""call me Ishmael."" How fun is that?!I think perhaps this is one of the first movies I've seen wherein the art direction takes such a load off the rest of the film. And somehow that was enough for me.The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen isn't a great movie. It isn't even a great superhero film.

The only thing I didn't care about in the film was the guy who drank all the Hyde Potion and turned into that huge disgusting monster. But the highlights of the film were the scenes with Richard Roxburgh. That man can truly act, he gets your attention. He is also good at dialect, for instance, when he was the Phantom he spoke with a German accent, when he was 'M' he spoke with a very proper British accent, then at the end when he was Moriarty it was more like a kind of cockney or maybe it was just a strong Austrailian accent (knowing him being from Austraila). He did his scenes well, though there were too few of them. That stupid Tom Sawyer shouldn't have killed him. Although, I've heard that in the Sherlock Holmes novels they can't seem to kill Moriarty.

This movie is a must for readers of classic literature since its main characters are:*Allan Quatermain from the novel ""King Solomon's Mines"" by H. Rider Haggard*Captain Nemo from ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" by Jules Verne*The Invisible Man from ""The Invisible Man"" by H. G. Wells*Wilhelmina Harker from ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker*Dorian Gray from ""The Portrait of Dorian Gray"" by Oscar Wilde*Tom Sawyer from ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn"" by Mark Twain*Dr. Jeckyll from ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" by Robert Louis StevensonFor all of you who don't know who these characters are and have never read the original ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman"" graphic novels by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, if you really want to enjoy this movie as much as I did, you probably should read some of these classic novels first.The plot is a very old and tried one, which has been re-done in this movie surprisingly well. Although you shouldn't expect many unanticipated twists in the story, do look for enjoyable references to other novels like: ""Crimes of the Rue Morgue"" by Edgar Allan Poe, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" by Gaston Leroux and ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, among others. It even pays homage to Ian Fleming's 007 (James Bond) characters and Sir Sean Connery himself, as it includes a short banter with two characters named M and Q.The direction and editing of the movie is good, the story is coherent and follows a reasonable path so you won't be disappointed, the characters and their dialogues are right on target, and the setting, costumes and actor's performances are great. There are only two reasons why I give this movie only four stars: first, some very bad special effects (although, most of them are superb and it's a treat to watch how these were done on the Special Features) and second, a not-so-unexpected ending that yells, ""Sequel, sequel, sequel!""Surprisingly good fantasy/action/adventure movie overall.--Reviewed by M.

However, adaptation is the key word here, because while some of the characters from the series are here, and the time period intact, the film's is indeed it's own story.For those unfamiliar with the comic series, I will provide a bit of background. In 1999 Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, two famous comic authors/illustrators came up with a phenomenal idea for a new comic. Comibining characters from classic English literature of the 19th century, the two men formed what could be described as the first X-Men, each character had a certain skill, but also a dark past.The characters featured in the book were the famous hunter/adventurer Alan Quatermain, Dracula victim Mina Harker (going by her maiden name of Murray,) Dr. Henry Jekyll and his alter-ego Edward Hyde, and the Invisible Man, Hawley Griffin.In keeping with my own belief that you should never give too much away in a review, I will not give any details of either plot away. I will go so far as to say that despite the movie's differences from the book, it was still enjoyable.I always enjoy seeing Sean Connery on screen, and although he is getting a bit old for the fight scenes, he does hold his own quite well.If you're a big fan of action films it's definitely worth adding to your collection.

But in the end it was a delight.  I enjoyed how they brought in each character, how they set up the plot, how they carefully set up the foundation to make it easy to move right into the action and adventure of the latter parts of the film.I wish they had kept some of the deleted scenes in the film, because some of them were important, linking one scene to another, but in the end the film was a good one.  The extras in the DVD, from the behind-the-scenes documentary and audio commentaries, really add to the DVD.Something to add to your DVD library if you are a fan of the old novels, with such super-stars like the great white hunter, Allan Quatermain, the sub captain, Captain Nemo, and that great scientist, Dr. Henry Jekyll.If you enjoyed this movie, remember that the graphic novels are available.

613497,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JM5B,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[0, 2]","Theatrical adaptations of famous comic books are becoming the new trend these days in Hollywood. The major studios are digging out every comic book superhero imaginable even the lesser known ones and so far the films have been successful. So it isn?t surprising that 20th Century is stepping up to the plate for the third time this year. Daredevil was a moderate success garnering $100 million against a $75 million budget and X2: X-Men United kicked off the summer season with a bang gathering $210 million against a $100 million budget. Fox is hoping that The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will be just as successful but it will be a hard sell. The League is a much lesser known comic book mini-series then big profiles superheroes like Spider-Man or X-Men, so there won?t be as big of a fan base to rely on. Another problem is the now blatant fact that not all comic-book adaptations take with movie-goers. Though The Hulk?s opening weekend became the highest grossing opening weekend ever for the month of June, the film itself was received poorly by both the critics and the general public and experienced a nearly seventy percent drop in its second weekend. Rumors of fights breaking out between Sean Connery and director Stephen Norrington helped generate bad buzz for the film. and the lackluster advertising campaign for the film have not helped in the studio?s efforts to create substantial buzz going for this feature.The story centers on the formation of a team of extraordinary individuals that must fight an evil man who has plans for the world. During the year 1899, an evil individual by the name of The Fanthom has gone around the world capturing scientists and causes major catastrophes in order to have the European countries blame each other. This, he hopes, will cause the countries to create a world war and with his advanced military weapons, the European countries will have to buy from him creating a huge profit for himself. The British Empire, determined to avert a world war, calls upon a man named ?M? to assemble The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Allan Quartermain, the hero of such tales as King Solomon?s Mines, is chosen to lead the team. Other members of the team include Rodney Skinner (The Invisible Man), Mina Harker (Vampire), Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll, and Dorian Grey, each of which holds a special ability unique to the team. Joining along for the ride is Agent Sawyer (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) from the United States. Each individual seems to have a hidden secret and don?t get along with each other but they must put their scrabbles aside in order to save the world from the brink of war. The story for The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen gets off to a good start and ends fairly well but sequences in between seem to drag the entire picture down, making it the entire experience seem worse then it actually was. The dialogue stays on the serious side which works for it but when it begins to slip into a more comical form, the quality of the picture is lost. Those not familiar with the famous literary characters involved in the film may be confused with the lack of background information given on many of them but perhaps that just means you need to bone up on your reading skills.If you looking for extraordinary acting and premium star power, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is definitely not your film, but most people, those with a brain, will know that going into this film. Sean Connery lights up the screen in the role of Allan Quartermain and feels appropriately cast as a man who continues to do the job he has been doing for many years despite his increasing age. There were consistent rumors from the set that Connery and director Norrington were at each other?s necks throughout the shoot but there is no evidence to say those fights affected his performance from what is shown in the film. Tony Curran, who plays the role of The Invisible Man, does as best of a job as he can but this character has its share of problems. The Invisible Man seems to be nothing more then a comedic special effects diversion and seems to just plain disappear (no pun intended) for a good portion of the movie with no explanation as to why he left or how he came to a particular place. Jason Flemying does his best with the role of Dr. Jekyll, which is pretty good for the most part, but his character is also a special effect diversion when he becomes Mr. Hyde. Shane West is great as Agent Sawyer, though the film could have done a better job explaining how this care free boy from Mississippi came to be in the secret service but that is a minor squabble. Peta Wilson, who is best known from La Femme Nikita fame, does what she can with the role of Mina Harker but there are too many questions and not enough answers, a constant theme in this film. What is the deal with her and Dorian Grey? And speaking of Dorian Grey, Stuart Townsend is horribly miscast in this role and the character itself is predictable and uninteresting.Overall, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen make come as a disappointment to the average moviegoer, one who isn?t a comic-book fanatic or literary wizard, but even for those select few who are this film may still be a little tough to swallow. Specific background information on many of the film?s primary characters is missing which leaves most of the audience struggling to figure out where they are coming from and how that helps play out the film?s ending. The League?s special effects are difficult to put on a scale based on the films offered thus far this year; on the one hand, they lack the superior quality present in Pirates of the Caribbean but on the other hand, they aren?t clunky as was present in The Hulk. What is certain is the scenes containing the repulsive Nautilus, Captain Nemo?s submarine, are the worst examples of computer animation presented this summer. The action sequences are the sufficient enough to keep the attention of movie-goers looking for some different for one night as opposed to seeing Pirates once again. It may not be fantastic, it may not even be mediocre to some, but it?s worth the price of admission ? for a matinee at least.",3,The Moose Hole - 'League' Not Quite 'Extraordinary',1078531200,"03 6,

Yet there is a borderline that any director should not cross, no matter how excited he or she is by the new toys available to them, and that is plot and entertainment.When the use of digital effects takes priority at the expense of a coherent plot,then we,as an intelligent audience regardless of our age, background or tastes, have a problem.This is exactly what happened with The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.The premise was good enough to start with:a group of literary heroes spring to life to defend the world from a evil psycho,and the collection of these heroes is very interesting indeed, Allan Quatermain (an always excellent Sean Connery), Dorian Gray(Stuart Townsend),Tom Sawyer (Shane West), a sexy Vampire out of Van Helsing's entourage, Captain Nemo (the brilliant Naseeruddin Shah), Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde (Jason Fleming) and the invisible man.Yet the non stop action was so digitilized that in some scenes, especially the underwater shots and the destruction of Venice I was not sure whether I was watching a normal film or an animated feature from Dreamworks!! You can really feel that director Stephen Norrington( Blade) has pushed the limits of what he can do technically, and loaded each scene with too much digital experimentation,and as the cliche goes about too much of anything, just half way through the movie these scenes stopped being impressive and became annoying.It is time that the huge digital development in moviemaking SERVES the movie and not vice versa, for no matter how advanced we become, we, the viewers, will still need the simplest of all, a good story and plot and some good old entertainement.",2,Digital Overdose!!,1071187200,"12 12, 2003",2003,1899,"['Movies', 'new', 'millenium', 'have', 'benefited', 'greatly', 'technological', 'advances', 'digital', 'age', 'filmmaking', 'forever', 'changed', 'infinite', 'possibilties', 'directors', 'can', 'use', 'new', 'technology', 'enhance', 'movie', 'impress', 'dazzle', 'viewers', 'borderline', 'director', 'should', 'not', 'cross', 'matter', 'how', 'excited', 'new', 'toys', 'available', 'plot', 'entertainment.When', 'use', 'digital', 'effects', 'priority', 'expense', 'coherent', 'plot', 'then', 'intelligent', 'audience', 'regardless', 'age', 'background', 'tastes', 'have', 'problem.This', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen.The', 'premise', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'start', 'group', 'literary', 'heroes', 'spring', 'life', 'defend', 'world', 'evil', 'psycho', 'collection', 'heroes', 'very', 'interesting', 'indeed', 'Allan', 'Quatermain', 'always', 'excellent', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Shane', 'West', 'sexy', 'Vampire', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'entourage', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'brilliant', 'Naseeruddin', 'Shah', 'Dr', 'Jekyll/Mr', 'Hyde', 'Jason', 'Fleming', 'invisible', 'man.Yet', 'non', 'stop', 'action', 'was', 'so', 'digitilized', 'scenes', 'especially', 'underwater', 'shots', 'destruction', 'Venice', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'watching', 'normal', 'film', 'animated', 'feature', 'Dreamworks', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Norrington', 'Blade', 'pushed', 'limits', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'technically', 'loaded', 'scene', 'too', 'much', 'digital', 'experimentation', 'cliche', 'about', 'too', 'much', 'anything', 'just', 'way', 'movie', 'scenes', 'stopped', 'being', 'impressive', 'became', 'annoying.It', 'time', 'huge', 'digital', 'development', 'moviemaking', 'SERVES', 'movie', 'not', 'vice', 'versa', 'matter', 'how', 'advanced', 'become', 'viewers', 'will', 'still', 'need', 'simplest', 'good', 'story', 'plot', 'good', 'old', 'entertainement']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Based on the graphic novel by reknowned comic scribe Alan Moore (who also wrote From Hell which was also made into a film by Fox), LXG focuses on adventurer Alan Quatermain (Sean Connery) who is united with Tom Sawyer (Shane West), Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), Captain Nemo (Naseerruddin Shah), Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Dr. Jekyll (Jason Flemyng), and an Invisible Man (Tony Curran) to combat a force known only as The Phantom who attempts to take over the world.  The juvenile plot is a far cry from Moore's book, and the direction from Stephen Norrington (Blade) is the only thing besides the acting from Connery and Shah that seems to have any inspiration at all.  I like the idea of using actual special effects as opposed to overbloated CGI, but the film as a whole just tanks thanks to some unexplained elements, plot holes galore, and twists and turns we see coming a mile away.  Rumor has it that Norrington and Connery practicly came to blows during filming; that probably would have been more entertaining than this turkey.  The DVD itself is another nicely assembled disc by Fox featuring commentaries, deleted scenes, and an almost hour long documentary, but none of it is worth sitting through LXG for.

The movie attempts to show how secret forces operated behind the creation of the Twentieth Century and the world wars during that century.  At the end of the movie, the character representing the British empire played by Sean Connery, Alan Quartermain, remarks that as the Nineteenth Century belonged to him so the Twentieth will belong to the young American boy, &quot;Sawyer&quot;.  Thus, we see how the British empire has faded and the rise of the American superpower brought about through the First and Second World Wars.  The movie unfortunately isn't able to fully show the detail of this interpretation.  I enjoyed this movie and it raised for me many questions about the role of secret forces influencing the birth of the Twentieth Century.  When the League is initiated we see a masonic symbol on the door to the hall where the League has its first meeting.

Here we go!  The year is 1898 and a sinister scheme is afoot to get the Germans at war with England.  Although the horseless carriage was still a novelty back then, our heroes drive off in a futuristic limo and don't seem the least surprised by the technology (e.g. alternator, distributor, fuel injection, etc.); although not even the BAR or Thompson Automatic had been invented at that time, the antagonists are armed with assault rifles and no one seems one seems the least perplexed. The most absurd part is Captain Nemos' cruiseship-sized submarine gliding through Venice's canals that can't be more than 20' deep (an absurdity in and of itself) with less wake than a rowboat. Some reviewers have praised the film for Nemo's depiction as a Hindu but Jules Verne never specifically mentions Nemo's ethnicity other than vaguely defining him as an Indo-European who is not from Northern Europe.  He could have been Spanish, Italian, Greek, Turkish, or Hindu: who knows! He certainly was never described as having worn a turban on his head as shown in the film. Dr. Jekyll's Mr. Hyde is more like the Incredible Hulk than simply his psychotic alter-ego; and, the most absurd part is a 20-year old Tom Sawyer who, in 1898, would probably be at least 45 years of age.  Don't bother looking for an engaging or even coherent plot in this film because there simply isn't one.  Finally, as if that weren't enough, there's no acting to praise because they're really just reading the script as they go along with this farce of a movie.Although I respect the use of fantasy in film such as in Conan, Lord of the Rings, etc., the juxtaposition of history and characters in this film is just too idiotic.  It demonstrates more a lack of imagination on the part of those who prepared this screenplay; instead of coming up with any interesting characters of their own, they hastily and clumsily cut and pasted a collage of cultural/historical icons and turned them into pure fantasy (contrived fantasy at that.)  I have more respect for the traditional characters from Marvel comics or others who are just in an entirely imaginary society: at least Stan Lee and other comic writers used their own talents of imagination instead of borrowing someone else's.

For the critics, the thing that hurt this film so badly was its release in a year of premier releases. Pirates of the Carribean stole the show for a lot of otherwise pretty good films, which include the second Tomb Raider, third Matrix, third Terminator, and second X-Men. League falls behind most of them and lines up about equal to the third Terminator. It does better than Hulk in both story line and watchability (the split screen comic book style of Hulk was distracting and actually gave me a headache!).Where the film fails is in the storyline itself. First, the characters are fictionalizations of fictional characters. Tom Sawyer never grew up with his world, Dorian Gray is out of place, Nemo was embittered against society (and never a pirate), and Quartermain was, well, boring at best. The one thing that saves the characterizations is that they are out of copyright and so are subject to being changed...The story develops decently, but is a bit disjointed here and there. It moves along a little faster than perhaps good timing would dictate and the ending... well, there's a better way to end it and something more in keeping with the fun and games that this film should have contained...Which is also why it fails. Where Jolie's Tomb Raider succeeds is the same place where Depp's pirate succeeds. It doesn't take itself too seriously. This film, while it works at times as a fun chase, has elements which are far too serious and if those were eliminated and some of the storyline fleshed out, this film could measure up to rate four stars.Connery turns in his usual fine performance as do most of the other actors. Some of the film doesn't work (the black/white &quot;revelation&quot; while listening to an audio recording which, by the way carries a sound far above audibility and way out of the ability of that kind of player) while other parts do (Nemo's transportation, both on water and on land).But, it is still a fun action film and if you like action/heroic comic books on film, this one works quite well...",3,A little above the cut...,1075075200,"01 26, 2004",2004,2147,"['saw', 'theater', 'bought', 'DVD', 'rates', 'quot', 'bit', 'average', 'quot', 'three', 'stars', 'critics', 'thing', 'film', 'so', 'badly', 'was', 'release', 'year', 'premier', 'releases', 'Pirates', 'Carribean', 'stole', 'show', 'lot', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'good', 'films', 'include', 'second', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'third', 'Matrix', 'third', 'Terminator', 'second', 'X-Men', 'League', 'most', 'lines', 'up', 'about', 'equal', 'third', 'Terminator', 'better', 'Hulk', 'story', 'line', 'watchability', 'split', 'screen', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'Hulk', 'was', 'distracting', 'actually', 'gave', 'headache', '.Where', 'film', 'storyline', 'First', 'characters', 'are', 'fictionalizations', 'fictional', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'never', 'grew', 'up', 'world', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'place', 'Nemo', 'was', 'embittered', 'society', 'never', 'pirate', 'Quartermain', 'was', 'well', 'boring', 'best', 'one', 'thing', 'characterizations', 'are', 'copyright', 'so', 'are', 'subject', 'being', 'changed', 'story', 'decently', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'here', 'there', 'little', 'faster', 'perhaps', 'good', 'timing', 'would', 'dictate', 'ending', 'well', 'better', 'way', 'end', 'something', 'more', 'keeping', 'fun', 'games', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'contained', 'Which', 'also', 'why', 'Where', 'Jolie', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'same', 'place', 'where', 'Depp', 'pirate', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'film', 'times', 'fun', 'chase', 'elements', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'serious', 'were', 'eliminated', 'storyline', 'fleshed', 'out', 'film', 'could', 'measure', 'up', 'rate', 'four', 'stars.Connery', 'usual', 'fine', 'performance', 'do', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'black/white', 'quot', 'revelation', 'quot', 'listening', 'audio', 'recording', 'way', 'sound', 'far', 'audibility', 'way', 'ability', 'kind', 'player', 'other', 'parts', 'do', 'Nemo', 'transportation', 'water', 'land', '.But', 'still', 'fun', 'action', 'film', 'like', 'action/heroic', 'comic', 'books', 'film', 'one', 'quite', 'well']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
613520,A14B2NR2XELLQ0,B00005JM5B,Omer Belsky,"[3, 3]","The Critics seem unanimous in their dislike of 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', although they can't seem to agree upon why exactly it is bad.  Some critics dislike the 'alternative geography' of Venice; Some dislike the incoherent plot, while others seem to think the usage of Oscar Wilde, Arthur Conan Doyle and HG Wells characters in an action flick is an outrage.  They are all missing the point.Based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore (of which I've only read the first part yet), The league of Extraordinary Gentlemen has the coolest concept I've seen in the movies for a long, long time - I can't think of any movie since 'Memento' which had such a cool central idea - it takes all the classic heroes of Victorian literature and turns them into heroes in a wild, James Bond-esque action adventure.  Although the adaptation stays away from the plot of the comic, it maintains the spirit of outrageous fun, which makes this one of the most entertaining movies Hollywood has produced lately, like Pirates of the Caribbean and Terminator 3.After a tank rolls into the Bank of England, the movie splits into three main section.  First, we have a near flawless introduction of the characters, from the retired Allan Quatermain(Sean Connery), through The Invisible Man (Tony Curran), Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), Mina Harker(of Dracula fame, portrayed by Peat Wilson)  Durian Grey (introduced in the film's finest action sequence, and brilliantly played by Stuart Townsend), the improbable Tom Sawyer (Shane West), who should have been in his 80s in 1899.  The sequence culminates in the appearance of the film's most fantastic character, the CGI created Nautilus.After picking up Dr Jekyl (Jason Flemyng), and his alter ego Mr. Hyde (accurately described by Roger Ebet as a ""WWF version of Fat Bastard""), the middle section of the film involved an unlikely but well executed chase sequence in Venice (yes, you couldn't drive a car there, nor could a ship the size of the Nautilus really navigate in it, but that's trivial nitpicking, in my view), a betrayal, and a clever combination of exposition and sabotage, in the best homage to camp.The final part of the film is a traditional ""scale the bad guy's castle"" sequence in snowy Mangolia, which is saved from mediocrity by the fine acting all around, and by several meaty scenes, like a confrontation between two main characters, which gives tribute to the book the villain came from.The film is not without problems.  The plot is overly cliche, and could have used some more meat.  Much early banter, especially between Quatermain and Mina Harker, clearly reflects earlier versions of the story which stayed closer to the original version.  The Hyde and Jekyl characters are not dealt with particularly well, and the Nemo role is underwritten.  The worst part, though, is the treatment of the mysterious M, by far the highlight of the graphic novel, which is completely ruined in the film.Yet in the end, none of these problems matter.  Fun all the way through, 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', is an exciting adventure story, where the brilliance of the concept far overshadows any weaknesses in the plot.",4,Victorian Superheroes,1066435200,"10 18, 2003",2003,3177,"['Critics', 'seem', 'unanimous', 'dislike', ""'The"", 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'agree', 'why', 'exactly', 'bad', 'critics', 'dislike', ""'alternative"", 'geography', 'Venice', 'incoherent', 'plot', 'others', 'seem', 'think', 'usage', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'HG', 'Wells', 'characters', 'action', 'flick', 'outrage', 'are', 'missing', 'point.Based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Alan', 'Moore', ""'ve"", 'only', 'read', 'first', 'part', 'yet', 'league', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'coolest', 'concept', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', ""'Memento"", 'had', 'cool', 'central', 'idea', 'classic', 'heroes', 'Victorian', 'literature', 'heroes', 'wild', 'James', 'Bond-esque', 'action', 'adventure', 'adaptation', 'away', 'plot', 'comic', 'spirit', 'outrageous', 'fun', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'produced', 'lately', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Terminator', '3.After', 'tank', 'Bank', 'England', 'movie', 'three', 'main', 'section', 'First', 'have', 'near', 'flawless', 'introduction', 'characters', 'retired', 'Allan', 'Quatermain', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Tony', 'Curran', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'Naseeruddin', 'Shah', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'Dracula', 'fame', 'portrayed', 'Peat', 'Wilson', 'Durian', 'Grey', 'introduced', 'film', 'finest', 'action', 'sequence', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'improbable', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Shane', 'West', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', '80s', '1899', 'sequence', 'appearance', 'film', 'most', 'fantastic', 'character', 'CGI', 'created', 'Nautilus.After', 'picking', 'up', 'Dr', 'Jekyl', 'Jason', 'Flemyng', 'alter', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'accurately', 'described', 'Roger', 'Ebet', 'WWF', 'version', 'Fat', 'Bastard', 'middle', 'section', 'film', 'involved', 'unlikely', 'well', 'executed', 'chase', 'sequence', 'Venice', 'yes', 'could', ""n't"", 'drive', 'car', 'there', 'could', 'ship', 'size', 'Nautilus', 'really', 'navigate', 'trivial', 'nitpicking', 'view', 'betrayal', 'clever', 'combination', 'exposition', 'sabotage', 'best', 'homage', 'camp.The', 'final', 'part', 'film', 'traditional', 'scale', 'bad', 'guy', 'castle', 'sequence', 'snowy', 'Mangolia', 'saved', 'mediocrity', 'fine', 'acting', 'several', 'meaty', 'scenes', 'confrontation', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'tribute', 'book', 'villain', 'came', 'from.The', 'film', 'not', 'problems', 'plot', 'overly', 'cliche', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'meat', 'Much', 'early', 'banter', 'especially', 'Quatermain', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'clearly', 'earlier', 'versions', 'story', 'stayed', 'closer', 'original', 'version', 'Hyde', 'Jekyl', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'dealt', 'particularly', 'well', 'Nemo', 'role', 'underwritten', 'worst', 'part', 'treatment', 'mysterious', 'M', 'far', 'highlight', 'graphic', 'novel', 'completely', 'ruined', 'film.Yet', 'end', 'none', 'problems', 'matter', 'Fun', 'way', ""'The"", 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'exciting', 'adventure', 'story', 'where', 'brilliance', 'concept', 'far', 'weaknesses', 'plot']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Hubbard,"[1, 2]","The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is really an extraordinary superhero movie although these heroes aren't from comic books but the books of great literature. A hunter, a scientist, a vampire, an invisible man, an immortal, a spy, and a beast -- the imndomitable Alan Quatermain from of H. Rider Haggard's 1885 novel King Solomon's Mines;  Mina Harker from Bram Stroker's immortal vampire book Dracula; Captain Nemo from Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under  the Sea; the sleek and sinister Dorian Gray from Oscar Wilde's the Picture of Dorian Gray; Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde comes from  Robert Louis Stevenson's short novel Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; a grown-up Tom Sawyer, called Agent Sawyer, from Mark Twains various novels; and the thief Rodney Skinner standing in for H. G. Well's Invisible Man-- are all treated as real people who lived, worked, fought, and even died around the turn of twentieth century and that all of the adventures written about them weren't fiction, but just the events that made up the days of their lives. And here they fight a villainous master-mind who is trying to start a world war just to make profits for himself.I don't know why, but at first, I did not not like this movie. But then I watched it again for a second time and found that despite a certain grimness to the sets that represent 19th century London and Paris, this is a great action/adventure film to rival any James Bond or X-Man movie. It was the kind of a movie that made wished I had read the books all of those heroes-- and the surprise villain-- came from. I think that in spite of the violence, and there is a lot of it, this might be a very good movie for parents to watch with their older kids and point out to them that the great works of literature can be just as exciting as any comic book or video game and get them started on reading just for the pleasure of reading.",5,Who Knew Victorian Heroes Could Be So Super!,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,1899,"['League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'really', 'extraordinary', 'superhero', 'movie', 'heroes', 'are', ""n't"", 'comic', 'books', 'books', 'great', 'literature', 'hunter', 'scientist', 'vampire', 'invisible', 'man', 'immortal', 'spy', 'beast', 'imndomitable', 'Alan', 'Quatermain', 'H.', 'Rider', 'Haggard', '1885', 'novel', 'King', 'Solomon', 'Mines', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'Bram', 'Stroker', 'immortal', 'vampire', 'book', 'Dracula', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'Jules', 'Verne', '20,000', 'Leagues', 'Sea', 'sleek', 'sinister', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Doctor', 'Jekyll', 'Mister', 'Hyde', 'Robert', 'Louis', 'Stevenson', 'short', 'novel', 'Strange', 'Case', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'grown-up', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'called', 'Agent', 'Sawyer', 'Mark', 'Twains', 'various', 'novels', 'thief', 'Rodney', 'Skinner', 'standing', 'H.', 'G.', 'Well', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'are', 'all', 'treated', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'worked', 'fought', 'even', 'died', 'turn', 'twentieth', 'century', 'adventures', 'written', 'were', ""n't"", 'fiction', 'just', 'events', 'made', 'up', 'days', 'lives', 'here', 'fight', 'villainous', 'master-mind', 'who', 'trying', 'start', 'world', 'war', 'just', 'make', 'profits', 'himself.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'first', 'did', 'not', 'not', 'movie', 'then', 'watched', 'again', 'second', 'time', 'found', 'certain', 'grimness', 'sets', 'represent', '19th', 'century', 'London', 'Paris', 'great', 'action/adventure', 'film', 'rival', 'James', 'Bond', 'X-Man', 'movie', 'was', 'kind', 'movie', 'made', 'wished', 'had', 'read', 'books', 'heroes', 'surprise', 'villain', 'came', 'think', 'spite', 'violence', 'lot', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'parents', 'watch', 'older', 'kids', 'point', 'out', 'great', 'works', 'literature', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'exciting', 'comic', 'book', 'video', 'game', 'get', 'started', 'reading', 'just', 'pleasure', 'reading']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

So where does it rank? Well if you did not like The Hulk then you will find LXG a much more suitable superhero mash.LXG has a few problems. Sean Connery is not exactly flaring across the screen and even though all the other superheroes are given enough screen time it is surprisingly a fairly wooden affair with not much fleshed out in the way of their backgrounds even though quite a bit is hinted at. So really our dependence in engaging these characters is with their action quality. We would expect LXG to have lots in that department, but sadly what action there is just turns out to be a ""been there before and bought the T-shirt"" except for one good action sequence in Venice which is quite frankly a little bit hard to follow or understand and never really amounts to much. So the action is a way below par, especially if you have seen the likes of Blade from the same director - Stephen Norrington.Where LXG really stands out is in the design and the concept realized onto the screen looks simply amazing. It is like Batman crossed with Wild Wild West. In fact Wild Wild West is exactly the same kind of summer bummer unblockbuster as this one. LXG looks incredible and certainly moves along at a good pace but ultimately it just as forgettable with nothing to really make you want to catch a sequel.When all is said and done LXG is far from the worst DVD you can pick up for some pop-corn fodder entertainment but at the same time is pretty much an under-nourishing experience with some good scenes but not a great movie.

Also I've always believed that a goal of ""remaining faithful to a comic book"" would be a ridiculous goal of a commercial adventure flick. So if you are offended by what I call the ""blasphemy against the inane"" then you might be offended by this film which features a great performance by Sean Connery even though you've seen this character portrayed by him many times.The spirit of a comic book is retained with much posturing and pretentious dialogue, the starkness between the heroes and villians and plenty of campy banter and comeradery. The main bad guy turns out to be a madman who wants to take over the world (surprise, surprise.) Foibles of the heroes are well explored - we see Jekyll's cowardice, Sawyer's youthful inexperience, Nemo's Kali-worship, Quartermain's indifference to his nation's plight, etc. The characters from famous literature are a bit ""off"" from their original, but fun nontheless; I can't imagine that Mark Twain wanted Tom Sawyer to become an intelligence agent for the United States, but it's played out cleverly in the plot.The effects are stunning; I especially liked the Nautilus design and the way the Invisible Man was portrayed. The dialogue never gets too silly and when the viewer feels that it's about to it was saved by an action segment.

So if you can imagine where my brain took the few incendiary images it perceived, you can imagine the disappointment I felt when I finally was able to view the film itself.Not that I didn't enjoy the movie for what it is:  sublimely inspired schlock.  The Roger Eberts of the world can quibble about the implausibility of gigantic submarines surfacing in Venice canals...  do dreams always make sense?  Then, why must movies?What this movie points out to me is the potential that is there for a truly inspired artist to make a Victorian science fiction masterpiece, given the cinematic tools that are available today. I know of at least three eccentric geniuses that have drawn on the Victorian sensibility:  film director David Lynch (""Dune"" was a nice try, Dave, but you can do better),  photographer Joel- Peter Witkin ( a poet of the beauty of deformed weirdness ), and musician Robert Fripp, whose band King Crimson in its middle period was nothing if not Victorian mad-inventor strangeness.  If only a film director could make a movie as dark and twisted as Fripp's composition ""Fractured"",  I'd be a happy boy. Many other artists, visual and otherwise, have mined the Victorian imagination, but no film director has ever ""hit the jackpot"", so to speak.Someday, someone will make a dark, surreal Victorian sci-fi masterpiece.  But it hasn't been done yet, just as no one has ever gotten H.P.

Unfortunately, there are just too many problems with the movie for it to be worth buying:- there was no thought behind many of the special effects. When water rushes out of doors and along corridors, none of the running crewmen are bowled over. The chandeliers in the Nautilus don't swing during turns.  How could that huge Nautilus fit into a Ventian canal, let alone turn a corner?- there was no thought taken for the motivations of any of the characters, good or bad.  Why were Mina & Nemo there at all? What did the villain have to gain from his (fairly expensive) villainy?  And why was he personally there for all the big bombings and shootouts?  Playing it a little risky for an evil mastermind, eh?- Tell me again: how is firing a Polaris missile from the Nautilus into a specific Venitian building, guided by GPS location of a 1930's-style roadster supposed to save Venice from destruction? And how is it that the guys in the car can find this place through the winding streets of Venice but the crewman up in the crow's nest can't?  And why would you, as the evil genius behind the bombing of Venice not only station scores of your armored men along various (soon to be toast) streets and alleys on the off-chance that a gentlemen-filled car will drive by but also be present yourself? How did he expect to get away? And how did the Nautilus start to sink in Venice, then end up in the open sea when it popped back up?- The characters, so richly written 125 years ago, were never properly developed in the film. It was hard to care much about any of them.A little attention to detail could've turned this from a fun summer action-romp into a true X-Men meets Indiana Jones classic.

Why did they hate this film so much?! It has NON-stop action, great art direction, good casting, (I am in love with Peta WIlson!) a nice, world-threatening plot, (probably yet another nod to Connery,) and passable special effects.Perhaps it was the obvious hand that Marvel may have had in it...the whole movie reminds me an AWFUL lot of ""Van Helsing"",  what with Mr. Hyde having a prominent part in it, on top of the presence of Richard Roxburgh, who played Dracula in that movie. ""Van Helsing"" also, in turn, bore a strong resemblance to ""X-2, X-Men United"". CGI effects are also a lot more obvious in Marvel's movies than they are in anybody else's, and they are here...THAT could have been a put-off...but for me, the not-so-great CGI was hidden well enough by shadows so that it wasn't as bad as it was in ""The Hulk"" or ""Spiderman"".The group consists of: Allen Quartermain, (Connery...glad they didn't pick Richard Chamberlain,) Tom Sawyer, The Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, (wait 'til you see the Nautilus...WOW!) and a persona de femme from ""Dracula"", Mina Harker, played by Ms. Wilson. Dorian Grey is along for the ride, too, but how much can you trust a character made up by Oscar Wilde?It's great seeing Connery slug a villain and making it stick, at his age...(he's 77 now, can you believe it?) and Peta Wilson...YES!! Love that accent, love that stature, love that improvement-on-Julie-Christie thing she's got going for her....Love that car, too...I'll bet you anything either Panther Westwinds or Sbarro had something to do with that beast!

Again as I mentioned in my review of ""XMen 2"" this is a movie to be seen on the big screen.I saw this movie the same day I saw ""Terminator 3"" which I was disappointed in so I guess it all depends on where your mind is when you see movies.The individual introduction of each of the characters was ""fun"" I absolutely thought they selected the appropriate cast for each of these roles. From Alan Q. to the Invisible Man each of these actors were very convincing as their own UNUSUAL brand of Heroes and their many talents are only really shown I believe a total of 2 times in this movie. In this it reminds me of ""X Men 2"" each character only had a few instances to show their gifts/talents. The story is probably plausible for that era {Victorian Age} but maybe hard for the youngins of today to grasp.

It is for this reason I did not give the movie 5 stars.I also enjoyed picking out points that seemed to mirror other great classics, including ""the phantom of the opera""However, this is most certainly a great action movie and I thought the special effects were fairly well done, (though the end battle between hyde and the captain who drank Jekyll's formula was way over the top).I would suggest this movie, but not give such top recommendations as other movies like ""The Time Machine"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera"".But it deffinately made me want to go out and read books like ""The Portrait of Dorian Gray"", and ""Twenty THousand Leagues under the Sea.""",4,An Entertaining Watch...,1129593600,"10 18, 2005",2005,1333,"['most', 'part', 'did', 'enjoy', 'League', 'Extrodinary', 'Gentlemen', 'was', 'great', 'fun', 'see', 'many', 'characters', 'classic', 'books', 'i', 'enjoy', 'come', 'life', 'such', 'unusual', 'manner', 'loved', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'actors', 'loved', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Invisible', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'appreciate', 'was', 'glad', 'was', 'horribly', 'inappropriate', 'language', 'conduct', 'thank', 'goodness', 'SInce', 'league', 'extrodinary', 'GENTLEMEN', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'Mina', 'really', 'belonged', 'heroic', 'team', 'up', 'do', 'not', 'dracula', 'actions', 'were', 'down', 'right', 'disturbing', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'picking', 'out', 'points', 'seemed', 'mirror', 'other', 'great', 'classics', 'including', 'phantom', 'opera', 'However', 'most', 'certainly', 'great', 'action', 'movie', 'thought', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'end', 'battle', 'hyde', 'captain', 'who', 'drank', 'Jekyll', 'formula', 'was', 'way', 'top', '.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'movie', 'not', 'give', 'such', 'top', 'recommendations', 'other', 'movies', 'Time', 'Machine', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'deffinately', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'read', 'books', 'Portrait', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Twenty', 'THousand', 'Leagues', 'Sea']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

The fact that Sean Connery (an Action Film Icon) was the lead in this made me curious to buy it in the first place.  The storyline though simple, sometimes confusing once all the characters are brought together to save the world (how original), moves along quite fast and doesn't lull you to sleep the way Pirates of the Carribean did.  That was one boring overrated movie that was at least 35-40 minutes too long.  However, where Pirates failed in providing enough action to frankly keep you awake, at least League had enough action, and different characters that we've all grown up and read and heard about at some point to make the film interesting enough to watch it, and the supporting cast was also credible.  Like DeNiro, Connery can take a below average plot and make it above average just with his talent alone.  The DVD extras are wonderful and go in-depth about costume design, special effects, the choice of actors, and about the comic book this movie is based on.  It also details how Connery himself was offered the role in both the Matrix and Lords Of The Rings but had turned them both down because he didn't quite understand the complexity of both films.

I knew I had to see it when those who said it was so awful couldn't seem to agree if it sucked because it was highly predictable or because it was impossible to follow!

Some people have been way too tough on this obviously escapist adventure movie that's just designed to be an imaginative lark with beloved literary characters.

613550,A3PEQ9I5TEOOPR,B00005JM5B,Robert Schell,"[0, 0]","As other reviewers have noted, LXG is based upon a brilliant concept (classic 19th Century fantasy/action characters banded together), but the ultimate execution is somewhat unsatisfactory.  The makers of this movie let us know in one early scene (when Tom Sawyer picks up Jeckyll's hat) that tongue is firmly in cheek.  However, to make entertaining fantasy adventure, there has to be some believability and inner consistency to the alternate world created.  My main problem was the technology.  Rather than taking the ""future"" technology and making it appear turn-of-the century, we get a fully developed W.W.I style tank, a 1930's style automobile, and a Polaris missle shot from the Nautilus, even.Setting aside other problems noted by other reviewers, such as the impossibility of the Nautilus navigating the canals of Venice, or the age of Tom Sawyer (he should be at least in his fifties), it's an o.k. superhero action flick.  Sean Connery is the obvious highlight as Allan Quatermain (not ""Quartermain""), and there are some good supporting performances.  Some of the special effects are pretty good, and some leave something to be desired.  I didn't agree with the decision to make Mr. Hyde look like a cross between The Hulk and Popeye the Sailor Man, but I guess they felt they needed to embellish some of the characters to try to make them appeal to today's audiences.  If you're a fan of the superhero genre and/or you've read a lot of 19th Century fantasy fiction, this might appeal to you.

613551,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JM5B,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 9]","""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" got such punishing reviews when it was released in the summer of 2003 that it took me two years to finally get around to watching it.  And I must say that, now, having seen it, I can't understand what all the fuss was about.  This is a perfectly serviceable big budget action movie as such things go - not much better, but certainly no worse, than half a dozen similar movies released that summer (it's actually less bloated than the far more popular ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" which inexplicably garnered rave reviews and sailed off with boatloads of money).It's 1899, the dawn of a new century, one in which all the old weapons of war are fast becoming obsolete and are giving way to far more lethal implements of mass destruction - machine guns, armored tanks, submarines and mega-explosives - all capable of killing far greater numbers of people than was ever thought possible before.  Enter the Fantom [sic], a mysterious villain bent on using all this quickly developing technology to wage a global war with himself as commanding general.  To counter this, a man named ""M"" gathers together a group of characters culled from 19th Century literary sources - among them Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, even Tom Sawyer! - to do battle against the menace.Although the script could have done a better job fleshing out the characters and making them more intriguing and distinct as individuals, the film has a couple of interesting plot twists and enough high-tech hardware to keep us entertained, if not exactly enthralled, through most of its running time.  The movie is breezily paced and the screenplay has a fun time tossing around a lot of ""in"" jokes for those in the audience familiar with the literary backgrounds of these various characters.Sean Connery leads the cast as Allan Quartermain, an aging adventurer contentedly wiling away his golden years in Africa, until he is called back into the queen's service at this critical juncture in the empire`s - and the world's - history.  Naseeruddin Shah,  Peta Wilson, Tony Curran, Stuart Townsend, Shane West, Jason Flemyng and Richard Roxburgh round out the rest of the cast.There really isn't anything that ""extraordinary"" about this ""League,"" but if you happen to run across this film on cable some long, lonely night, you may find it passable for an evening's entertainment.",3,a bit better than expected,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,2413,"['League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'got', 'such', 'punishing', 'reviews', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'summer', '2003', 'took', 'two', 'years', 'finally', 'get', 'watching', 'must', 'say', 'now', 'having', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'perfectly', 'serviceable', 'big', 'budget', 'action', 'movie', 'such', 'things', 'go', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'certainly', 'worse', 'dozen', 'similar', 'movies', 'released', 'summer', 'actually', 'less', 'bloated', 'far', 'more', 'popular', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'inexplicably', 'garnered', 'rave', 'reviews', 'sailed', 'off', 'boatloads', 'money', '.It', '1899', 'dawn', 'new', 'century', 'one', 'old', 'weapons', 'war', 'are', 'fast', 'becoming', 'obsolete', 'are', 'giving', 'way', 'far', 'more', 'lethal', 'implements', 'mass', 'destruction', 'machine', 'guns', 'armored', 'tanks', 'submarines', 'mega-explosives', 'capable', 'killing', 'far', 'greater', 'numbers', 'people', 'was', 'ever', 'thought', 'possible', 'Enter', 'Fantom', '[', 'sic', ']', 'mysterious', 'villain', 'bent', 'using', 'quickly', 'developing', 'technology', 'wage', 'global', 'war', 'commanding', 'general', 'counter', 'man', 'named', 'M', 'gathers', 'together', 'group', 'characters', 'culled', '19th', 'Century', 'literary', 'sources', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'even', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'do', 'battle', 'menace.Although', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'making', 'more', 'intriguing', 'distinct', 'individuals', 'film', 'couple', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists', 'enough', 'high-tech', 'hardware', 'keep', 'entertained', 'not', 'exactly', 'enthralled', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'movie', 'breezily', 'paced', 'screenplay', 'fun', 'time', 'tossing', 'lot', 'jokes', 'audience', 'familiar', 'literary', 'backgrounds', 'various', 'characters.Sean', 'Connery', 'cast', 'Allan', 'Quartermain', 'aging', 'adventurer', 'contentedly', 'wiling', 'away', 'golden', 'years', 'Africa', 'called', 'back', 'queen', 'service', 'critical', 'juncture', 'empire', 's', 'world', 'history', 'Naseeruddin', 'Shah', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'Tony', 'Curran', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'Shane', 'West', 'Jason', 'Flemyng', 'Richard', 'Roxburgh', 'round', 'out', 'rest', 'cast.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'extraordinary', 'League', 'happen', 'run', 'film', 'cable', 'long', 'lonely', 'night', 'may', 'find', 'passable', 'evening', 'entertainment']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

The villian is very cartoonish and it motivated by the usual desire to rule the world.  The choice of league members is odd as well.  Some have extrordinary powers (immortality, invisiblity, great strength), while others are ordinary (Alan Quartermaine played by Sean Connery and the U.S. agent Sawyer).  Speaking of Connery, he is way too old to be playing an action hero and his fight scenes were lame and unbelievable.  Despite all these flaws, the worst aspect of the movie was the poorly done computer generated imagery.  The Nautilus looked like a cartoon and its movement through the water was unrealistic.  The worst example was Mr. Hyde, who looked bloated and plastic-like.  Much like the Hulk, Mr. Hyde was made too big, and the computer was unable to generate enough texture on his skin to make him look believable.

I don't think any movie should be compared to the original story anyway, as printed media and film are two completely different art forms.I rate this film a 5 because it lived up to the previews - there's a ton of action, beautiful and complex sets, cinematography, and fantastic stars radiating star quality. This is definitely Sean Connery's movie, but the rest of the League show their stuff to great advantage too, so it's not just a one-man show.Captain Nemo, played by an Indian actor who was in ""Monsoon Wedding"" is really great. Mina Harker, the Vampire, is played by the beautiful Peta Wilson from ""La Femme Nikita"" fame (television series, not the original movie). The League also includes Dr Jekyl/Mr. Hyde, whose Hyde is kind of like The Hulk, Tom Sawyer, an Invisible Man, and the immortal Dorian Gray.An evil villain known as ""The Shadow"" is setting out to create the first World War 20 years before one actually happens by posing as Germans and wreaking havoc in England, then posing as the Brits and wreaking havoc in Germany. His aim is to make a huge profit on armaments - he's created the first automatic gun.The League members track him down and try to put a stop to his dastardly plan, cracking jokes with aplomb. The movie has the same kind of tone and fun mood as ""The Mummy"" and the first ""Indiana Jones."" It wants to entertain us with heroic deeds, exotic locales and good humor. It rarely takes itself too seriously, never underestimates the audience, and the special effects are seamless, with plenty of pyrotechnics and practically the entire city of Venice crashing like dominoes one by one.The film moves very quickly. The storytelling is quite spare and to the point, with only a few quiet breaks in between the action. There's a nice reveal as things turn out to be not quite what they seem but I won't spoil it for you.If you're into this kind of film (you should be able to tell from the previews) you'll enjoy it.

613568,A3SQZCA0JFB5CV,B00005JM5B,S Martin,"[0, 0]","I really enjoyed this movie. I know it's following on the heels of other big comic book/graphic novel successes, like X-Men, Spiderman, Blade, and the others, but it's still a fun movie. The various literary characters were interesting, and together they had a variety of talents that the actors brought out well.There are a few inconsistencies in the movie that I caught the second time I watched it that bothered me a little. Mina Harker is a vampire, or at least appears to be one, but she's out in broad daylight in more than one occasion, which is something vampires traditionally can't do. Mr. Hyde lets out a yell while under water, yet we see no bubbles escape his mouth. And the citizens of Venice are celebrating Carnival in July, when it's traditionally celebrated in February. However, I can dismiss them as nothing major.One thing I was pleased of was the lack of major plot holes. The characters are interesting, although if you didn't have at least a little back story for all of them you'd probably be quite lost. To make up for that the movie moves quickly, there are seldom any long scenes, and it feels like they trimmed the movie down to its bare essentials.The DVD has decent extra features, the making of feature runs for quite a while, if you tell it to play all for all the bits, and the deleted scenes are interesting. However there are two things that bring the DVD itself down for me. First, there's no trailer. I like having the trailer on the DVD. And second, there's an ""important message"" on the DVD that is really out of place, and in my opinion, inappropriate. It's a public service announcement about smoking marijuana and how it causes fatal accidents.

The film is, of course based on the comic book literary characters, and not so much on their traditional literary roles.  One of the most interesting things done in this film dealt with Professor Moriarty.  At the beginning he is portrayed as a middle aged gentleman, and at the end he is shown in younger form.  Of course this is reminiscent of the idea that there were actually 3 Moriarty brothers - the elder being a professor, and the youngest being a criminal mastermind.  The younger, according to his creator, Jules Verne, kills the elder and disguises himself as the professor.  The only thing that would have been even wittier in this film would have been if they had managed to get Richard Roxburgh to play three roles instead of two, also posing as Captain Nemo.  There is a strong belief among Jules Verne scholars that Captain Nemo was infact Professor James Moriarty!!!  This film is an excellent action piece, whose only short coming would be the CGI effects (and no, Mr. Hyde is not CGI!!).

Thank goodness! It might have had a lesser budget if he'd rejected the script, and the acting certainly would have been diminished greatly.All the stars do an excellent job but, to be totally honest, the special effects (a combination of blue screen, miniatures, some of the largest sets ever built, and in-camera mixing) often steal the show in a wonderful, breathtaking way.This is a must-see movie, and that's coming from a guy who has not been overly impressed by most of the ""super hero"" films of recent years. The makeup is also incredible, particularly for the dual Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde character. Nina Harker, the subdued and proper 19th century lady, transforms spectacularly into a vicious vampire leading a hoard of vampire bats. Connery, as Allen Quartermain of ""King Solomon's Mines,"" is cool and great without the need for transformation. Dorian Gray, played by an actor who looks a bit like Johnny Depp, displays some impressive changes as well. Tom Sawyer seems an odd choice for a film that includes Capt.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[2, 2]","Stephen Norrington's &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; does away, to its detriment, with most of the story elements of Alan Moore's original source material.  Most of the nuances and character moments that made Moore's work so enjoyable have been completely excised.  What's left is a shell of a film that fails to entertain.A government official from England is sent to Kenya to find legendary adventurer Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery).  Quatermain is asked to join an odd team of unique individuals whose mission it will be to stop a madman intent on plunging the world into war.  The other members of the team include:  Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), Rodney Skinner the Invisible Man (Tony Curran), Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Tom Sawyer (Shane West), and Dr. Henry Jekyll (Jason Flemyng).  Together they travel the globe intent on neutralizing their adversary before global chaos ensues.There were two major missteps taken with ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" when it was translated to the big-screen.  First, the decision to replace Mina Harker as the team leader with Alan Quatermain destroys the amusing irony of having the lone woman in the group being deemed the most worthy person to lead the extraordinary ""gentlemen.""  Second, the decision to add Tom Sawyer to the team's roster undermines the distinctive English-feel of the original work.  The film is also awkwardly edited together to the point where one can't help but wonder if crucial transition scenes were left on the cutting room floor.

Since I don't know them I have nothing that I can complain about - I enjoyed them.  The film not only suffered because of the link to the graphic novels, but because it's release coincided with the release ofVan Helsing (Full Screen Edition)- even the DVD was released at the same time.What I love are the references to the older books, such as Moby Dick, Around the World in 80 Days, etc.  There are also hints as to who the baddy is very early on in the film.

On the good side,m we get to see a lot of Victorian era heros and villians.  Everyone wants to know what would have happen if these great characters had met.  Also, some of the action sequences are interesting.On the other hand, there are a lot of weak points.  There are so many characters, so the character development is superficial.  You get the feeling that the actors don't get along well because there is no warmth between the characters.  The characters become cardboard cutouts which just stand around delivering wooden lines.  Also the effects are cheesy at times.  For example, if you look closely at Hyde, you can see that he is just wearing a rubber suit.For me the biggest downfall is the inconsistency between this story and the original novels.  I'm a big fan of Nemo, so when I saw him walking around on land, and even worse, working for the Bristish Empire, his sworn enemy, it was just a little too far from the original character.  To see that proud freedom fighter as a lap dog of the British Empire was just too much for me to enjoy this movie fully.

In today's young and younger Hollywood, you just don't find too many grumpy old movie stars with the clout to have their name solo above the title of a $100 million summer action-fantasy like &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.&quot;Jackie Chan is seven months shy of 50, and still lithe as a cat scaling a wall. Nevertheless, it is clear in The Medallion that he is not the miraculous whirlwind he once was.His fight scenes and chases, while still choreographed with balletic ingenuity, tend to highlight earth-bound skills - like that wall-climbing trick he still executes so effortlessly.More tellingly, he submits at long last to the dominion of special effects.Particularly in the second half of the movie, he sails through the air in fanciful style, propelled by wires and computer-generated illusions.There is nothing inherently wrong with that, and heaven knows no other action star at work today has shown Chan's uncanny stamina. The guy deserves a break.Still, the high-flying digital tricks signal the end of the pure-Jackie era of no stunt doubles, no wires and no computer effects.Old-schoolers may mourn, but action stars like to show they are more than fists and feet, so why not the Chan Man himself?As if to underscore the transition to a new style, The Medallion also gives Chan a reasonable facsimile of a romance, not to mention his first serious on-screen kiss.Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black) does an able job as Nicole James, an Interpol officer who reconnects with Hong Kong inspector Eddie Yang (Chan) when he goes to Ireland looking for a kidnapped child.It seems the little boy was born to fulfill an ancient Buddhist prophecy about supernatural powers - including life and death - to be had with a certain magical medallion.Naturally, a megalomaniacal bad guy - with the wickedly lurid name of Snakehead (Julian Sands) - has gotten wind of the prophecy and means to have the medallion for himself.In the opening scenes, Eddie rescues the boy from a burning room shortly after sharing his octopus dinner with a street-side dog. (Nobody ever accused the Hong Kong action-movie community of excessive subtlety.) For the rest of the movie, he performs variations of the same feat, as the kid changes hands several times.At one point, Eddie even appears to be stone-cold dead, but having bonded with the life-and-death kid, he gets to come back. His rebirth bonus is virtual immortality. He can feel pain but doesn't bleed when injured - as demonstrated in a funny scene when he is stabbed repeatedly by an incredulous crony.That crony is another Interpol agent called Watson, played by the British slapstick comic Lee Evans (Mouse Hunt), who is sometimes charmingly clumsy and sometimes cloying and overbroad.Aside from such tone-deaf lapses, director Gordon Chan, who shares writing credit with four others, observes the conventions of the Jackie Chan style while adding a layer of high-tech polish to the proceedings.The movie's action scenes are choreographed by Chan's childhood friend Sammo Hung, the veteran Hong Kong director and actor best known in the United States from his stint on the TV series Martial Law.Hung's playful take on martial-arts style perfectly matches Chan's own comic bent; together they pack more wit into a simple chase than most action movies do into their most elaborate showdowns.It is that wit that is the sorriest loss in the turn to special effects.

613592,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JM5B,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","I hear many people saying ""the original comic (or graphic novel) is better"" and though I never read it, I believe them.  Like ""From Hell"" which is also based on the work of original writer Alan Moore, ""LXG"" suffers from muddled storytelling that goes from one big BANG-action to another bigger BANG, killing every merit of the film.  Though ""LXG"" is always great to see, and still an entertaining piece of work you will see in summer at local multiplex, its result is nothing remarkable.Before you see it, I have to say part of the film would offend some people who love reading classics.  The story involves ""extraordinary gentlemen"" in Western literary history, namely, Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, Mina Harker (from ""Dracula""), Dr. Jekyll (or his alter ego), Dorian Gray, Rodney Skinner (aka. The Invisible Man) and Tom Sawyer.  They are assembled under command of the British government's agent ""M,"" and are going to stop the secret plot planned by one evil genius ""Phantom.""  And Mina is supposed to have had a romantic relationship with Dorian.  Don't say that in your English class.  Your teacher might not find it amusing.The premise is wonderful and more intelligent than you can expect from regular Hollywood films.  Actually, there are many references to classic novels (mainly written in the latter half of 19th century), so when Nemo's chief assistant appears, he gives a quip: ""Call me Ishmael.""  For those who say the famous detective from Baker Street is missing in the list above, well, you will eventually know that his story is not totally forgotten.However ... yes, inspite of these interesting premise, ""LXG"" sinks deep into the sea with its unbelievably unwise choice of story and setting.  I only quote one example.  These gents (and a lady) goes to Venice, to stop the sabotage planned by Phantom.  Good.  And they go there by Nemo's submarine.  OK, but when you see that huge sub sneaks (literally) into the canals of the city, we start to doubt our eyes.  And then Tom Sawyer wildly drives a car in the street of Venice, and the villains start to attack with machine guns as if the film is ""SWAT,"" we are left speechless.  So, what is the point of making the 19th century background after all?The actions are not bad, nor great either, so don't expect much from that.  Still it must be said when the actors are allowed to show some tricks, the film is certainly engaging.  Sean Connery is as charismatic as ever, and Shane West (""A Walk to Remember"") fits the role of youngster who finds a father-son relation with Connery.  Mina Harker's Peta Wilson is also fascinating as blood-sucking vampire, and Nasseruddin Shah plays the role of Nemo quite effectively with dignity.In short, there is nothing extradordinary about ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" except for great production designs, and its photography (the latter by Dan Laustsen, ""Mimic"").  Not bad as critics say, but if you want really extraordinary people's story which is well-told, you can see ""X-Men.""",3,Muddled Story Kills Every Good Thing in LXG,1065830400,"10 11, 2003",2003,3002,"['hear', 'many', 'people', 'saying', 'original', 'comic', 'graphic', 'novel', 'better', 'never', 'read', 'believe', 'From', 'Hell', 'also', 'based', 'work', 'original', 'writer', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'LXG', 'suffers', 'muddled', 'storytelling', 'one', 'big', 'BANG-action', 'bigger', 'BANG', 'killing', 'merit', 'film', 'LXG', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'still', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'work', 'will', 'see', 'summer', 'local', 'multiplex', 'result', 'nothing', 'remarkable.Before', 'see', 'have', 'say', 'part', 'film', 'would', 'offend', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'reading', 'classics', 'story', 'extraordinary', 'gentlemen', 'Western', 'literary', 'history', 'namely', 'Allan', 'Quatermain', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'Dracula', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'alter', 'ego', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Rodney', 'Skinner', 'aka', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'are', 'assembled', 'command', 'British', 'government', 'agent', 'M', 'are', 'going', 'stop', 'secret', 'plot', 'planned', 'one', 'evil', 'genius', 'Phantom', 'Mina', 'supposed', 'have', 'had', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Dorian', 'Do', ""n't"", 'say', 'English', 'class', 'teacher', 'might', 'not', 'find', 'amusing.The', 'premise', 'wonderful', 'more', 'intelligent', 'can', 'expect', 'regular', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'Actually', 'are', 'many', 'references', 'classic', 'novels', 'mainly', 'written', 'latter', 'half', '19th', 'century', 'so', 'when', 'Nemo', 'chief', 'assistant', 'quip', 'Call', 'Ishmael', 'who', 'say', 'famous', 'detective', 'Baker', 'Street', 'missing', 'list', 'well', 'will', 'eventually', 'know', 'story', 'not', 'totally', 'forgotten.However', 'yes', 'inspite', 'interesting', 'premise', 'LXG', 'deep', 'sea', 'unbelievably', 'unwise', 'choice', 'story', 'setting', 'only', 'quote', 'one', 'example', 'gents', 'lady', 'Venice', 'stop', 'sabotage', 'planned', 'Phantom', 'Good', 'go', 'there', 'Nemo', 'submarine', 'OK', 'when', 'see', 'huge', 'sub', 'sneaks', 'literally', 'canals', 'city', 'start', 'doubt', 'eyes', 'then', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'wildly', 'car', 'street', 'Venice', 'villains', 'start', 'attack', 'machine', 'guns', 'film', 'SWAT', 'are', 'left', 'speechless', 'So', 'what', 'point', 'making', '19th', 'century', 'background', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'great', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Still', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'when', 'actors', 'are', 'allowed', 'show', 'tricks', 'film', 'certainly', 'engaging', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'as', 'charismatic', 'ever', 'Shane', 'West', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'role', 'youngster', 'who', 'father-son', 'relation', 'Connery', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'also', 'fascinating', 'blood-sucking', 'vampire', 'Nasseruddin', 'Shah', 'role', 'Nemo', 'quite', 'effectively', 'dignity.In', 'short', 'nothing', 'extradordinary', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'great', 'production', 'designs', 'photography', 'latter', 'Dan', 'Laustsen', 'Mimic', 'Not', 'bad', 'critics', 'say', 'want', 'really', 'extraordinary', 'people', 'story', 'well-told', 'can', 'see', 'X-Men']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

613594,AWRGM17GTMND8,B00005JM5B,"Tyler S. ""Super-Review""","[0, 1]","LXG is a flashy stylized action comic book movie, that fails to create desire for a sequel due to bad acting and bad writing.  Sadly enough it's one of the worst comic adaptations, and it managed to cause Alan Moore to lose faith in Hollywood.  One of the greatest comic writers suffers a big embarassment in this film.  Lucky enough for him, his other adaptations, which he refuses to watch, are outstanding (V for Vendetta, Watchmen, From Hell).  I can watch this movie and be entertained, but I can't give it credit for much of anything.  It's fight scenes are definately watchable, but everything else received no critical attention.The Good:  LXG is very slick and cool in terms of it's style.  The color palette and clothing are interesting, as is its sets and cinematography.  The fight scenes are thrilling, and the CG is very realistic.  I was glad to see a more realistic approach to the special effects, and not some goofy computer animated sigh-fest.  As for the good of this film, that gets me to watch it every now and then, this is it.The Bad:  The wonderful cast is slaughtered with horrible witty lines scattered endlessly throughout the script.  No one wants to see quirks and quips, we want realistic relations.  These actors can't make the dialogue seem real at all, and it's horrible to watch.  If I watched this in another language it might be more entertaining.  I hate to see nearly every line a joke, and not a moment of seriousness within the film.  It should have been handed to better writers and a better director, and it would have been a beautiful film.  We now have proof, that ""Blade"" was begginner's luck.I'm the type of viewer/reviewer who can sit down and watch the cheesy ones every now and then.  Some movies are almost unbearably campy, but they still manage to entertain.  If you can stay on the sunny side, then LXG might be worth your bucks.  If you are easily annoyed you might want to stay far away from the film.  There's plenty of great comic book adaptations out there.

613595,A3MUSWDCTZINQZ,B00005JM5B,"Ulalume Jones ""Creative Gal""","[7, 9]","There seems to be three schools of thought concerning this film. The first one consists of people who are bona fide Alan Moore fans who dislike this flick due to its plotline not following the first volume of the comic book and/or not having the arcane references to Victoriana in it. The second school comes from a place of action and mainstream sensibility, which tends to shun book smarts and literature in their movies. Their lack of being well versed makes them hate this movie because they can't understand the references and where the characters come from, even when the characters tell their stories in short form, to alert the unaware.  These people will never get the &quot;steampunk&quot; genre and never will. They will blame the filmmakers for making a bad movie that was not understandable.I am of the third school. I am a fan of Alan Moore's work, such as Watchman, From Hell and LXG. Even with my commitment to the superiority of this work over the film, which is a mere shadow, I still like this film very much.It is intelligent enough for Victoriana lovers like me to get their full dose of wonderful literary figures and also gives the fan of the comic book a few surprises from that world, like Dorian Grey and Tom Sawyer. Sure, the purist in me would have loved to have seen the whole Invisible Man impregnanting nuns in the convent scene amongst others. Yet watching this as a separate piece away from the comic books gives me a new appreciation of it.Maybe these changes came from wanting to make it a PG-13 film to expand the audience.  My only gripe with this was that I didn't get my comic book that was supposed to be free with this DVD because the place I bought it at wouldn't distribute the comic since it contained &quot;mature situations.&quot; Bummer. Anyhow, the changes in the movie strike me as delightful.For example, the idea of Quartermaine being representative of Old Era Britain, giving the League over to the New Era America of Sawyer. I thought this was clever. The record scene had a great way of conveying information about the plot in a unique, but still happily Victorian way.  Mina as a vampire added a fun twist to the story, though I feel this link is hinted at in the comics. Though the screenplay is not written by the creators of LXG, it is very thought out. Fans that were disappointed in this movie when it came out in the theater may want to rent the DVD to give it a second chance. I believe this movie was never given a chance to shine by many people.Conversely, if you are not a Victorian literature fan, I wouldn't recommend the film. You will get lost. To fully get the story and the comic, you need to read books like Around the World in 80 Days, Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Grey, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Murders in the Rue Morgue and other novels or at very least, have a basic understanding of those characters. When I saw this in the theatre, there was someone sitting behind me who didn't know who Tom Sawyer was, which proves our educational system is in the gutter. I personally, as a bookworm, got a perverse joy out of Mina and Dorian fighting each other, seeing past all the contradictions (well, she is out in daylight, at the end of Dracula, she doesn't turn into a vampire...didn't Dorian die at the end of his book?) and loving it for the sheer creativity of it. If you don't have the drive to want to learn about these characters, you should not waste your money and rent something like Fight Club or XXX. You will be happier and so will I. But please, don't blame the movie for your lack of knowledge, or ignorance of the &quot;steampunk&quot; genre. It isn't for everyone.Overall, the world of LXG onscreen is dazzling. The outfits were gorgeous, the sets amazing and the performances were good enough to carry it to the end and keep my attension fixed. Enough to even buy a copy of the DVD for myself. I am a true sucker for anything Victorian and anything &quot;steampunk,&quot; as the kids say. I hope, if anything, the movie converts more people to read about these characters outside of the their parts in the League and also introduce new fans to the genius that is Alan Moore.",5,Never given a chance to shine...,1072742400,"12 30, 2003",2003,4165,"['be', 'three', 'schools', 'thought', 'concerning', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'bona', 'fide', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'fans', 'who', 'dislike', 'flick', 'due', 'plotline', 'not', 'following', 'first', 'volume', 'comic', 'book', 'and/or', 'not', 'having', 'arcane', 'references', 'Victoriana', 'second', 'school', 'place', 'action', 'mainstream', 'sensibility', 'shun', 'book', 'smarts', 'literature', 'movies', 'lack', 'being', 'well', 'versed', 'hate', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'references', 'where', 'characters', 'come', 'even', 'when', 'characters', 'tell', 'stories', 'short', 'form', 'alert', 'unaware', 'people', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'quot', 'quot', 'genre', 'never', 'will', 'will', 'blame', 'filmmakers', 'making', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'understandable.I', 'am', 'third', 'school', 'am', 'fan', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'work', 'such', 'Watchman', 'From', 'Hell', 'LXG', 'Even', 'commitment', 'superiority', 'work', 'film', 'mere', 'shadow', 'still', 'film', 'very', 'much.It', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'Victoriana', 'lovers', 'get', 'full', 'dose', 'wonderful', 'literary', 'figures', 'also', 'fan', 'comic', 'book', 'few', 'surprises', 'world', 'Dorian', 'Grey', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Sure', 'purist', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'whole', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'impregnanting', 'nuns', 'convent', 'scene', 'amongst', 'others', 'watching', 'separate', 'piece', 'away', 'comic', 'books', 'new', 'appreciation', 'it.Maybe', 'changes', 'came', 'wanting', 'make', 'PG-13', 'film', 'expand', 'audience', 'only', 'gripe', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'free', 'DVD', 'place', 'bought', 'would', ""n't"", 'distribute', 'comic', 'contained', 'quot', 'situations.', 'quot', 'Bummer', 'Anyhow', 'changes', 'movie', 'strike', 'delightful.For', 'example', 'idea', 'Quartermaine', 'being', 'representative', 'Old', 'Era', 'Britain', 'giving', 'League', 'New', 'Era', 'America', 'Sawyer', 'thought', 'was', 'clever', 'record', 'scene', 'had', 'great', 'way', 'conveying', 'information', 'plot', 'unique', 'still', 'happily', 'Victorian', 'way', 'Mina', 'vampire', 'added', 'fun', 'twist', 'story', 'feel', 'link', 'hinted', 'comics', 'screenplay', 'not', 'written', 'creators', 'LXG', 'very', 'thought', 'out', 'Fans', 'were', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theater', 'may', 'want', 'rent', 'DVD', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'shine', 'many', 'people.Conversely', 'are', 'not', 'Victorian', 'literature', 'fan', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'lost', 'fully', 'get', 'story', 'comic', 'need', 'read', 'books', 'World', '80', 'Days', 'Dracula', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Grey', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'Murders', 'Rue', 'Morgue', 'other', 'novels', 'very', 'least', 'have', 'basic', 'understanding', 'characters', 'When', 'saw', 'theatre', 'was', 'someone', 'sitting', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'was', 'educational', 'system', 'gutter', 'personally', 'bookworm', 'got', 'perverse', 'joy', 'Mina', 'Dorian', 'fighting', 'other', 'seeing', 'contradictions', 'well', 'out', 'daylight', 'end', 'Dracula', ""n't"", 'turn', 'vampire', 'did', ""n't"", 'Dorian', 'die', 'end', 'book', 'loving', 'sheer', 'creativity', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'drive', 'want', 'learn', 'characters', 'should', 'not', 'waste', 'money', 'rent', 'something', 'Fight', 'Club', 'XXX', 'will', 'be', 'happier', 'so', 'will', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'movie', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'ignorance', 'quot', 'quot', 'genre', ""n't"", 'everyone.Overall', 'world', 'LXG', 'onscreen', 'dazzling', 'outfits', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'sets', 'amazing', 'performances', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'carry', 'end', 'keep', 'attension', 'fixed', 'Enough', 'even', 'buy', 'copy', 'DVD', 'am', 'true', 'sucker', 'anything', 'Victorian', 'anything', 'quot', 'steampunk', 'quot', 'kids', 'say', 'hope', 'anything', 'movie', 'more', 'people', 'read', 'characters', 'parts', 'League', 'also', 'introduce', 'new', 'fans', 'genius', 'Alan', 'Moore']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

This, despite the fact that &quot;classy&quot; and &quot;actor&quot; should never be used in the same sentence, much like &quot;clam&quot; and &quot;chowder&quot; or &quot;ginsu&quot; and &quot;hamster&quot;. It is apparent that actors in general, and Sean Connery in specific, will do absolutely anything for money. This includes, in Sean Connery's case, starring in an embarassment like The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Having seen too many movies like this, I'm not sure that the standards of the average actor are particularly different than the standards of the average prostitute. To get through this movie, Sean must have had to close his eyes and say &quot;This one is for the summer home in Morocco&quot; over and over again. Judging by the look on his face through most of the movie, I don't think it helped.The movie is a quick and dirty study in form over substance. All dialogue is one-liners, with lots of epic camera sweeps and over-the-top music (don't get me started on the state of mind of the average soundtrack composer). There's lots of fireballs and quickee sentimentality - the sort that resembles trying to pants a woman on her first date, at the restaraunt, in front of a very embarassed waiter.Each character is supposed to be from 19th century science fiction, but that mostly relates to the choice of names, since your average movie-goer knows as much about the 19th century as they do about world geography (hint: Norway is not in Central America). When did Dorian Gray become an adept fencer, unable to look at his painted portrait? When did vampires start flying with thousands of bats behind them? When did Captain Nemo become a Sikh? It doesn't matter, since the main business of movie-making these days is to rape the intellectual property of those who can't speak for themselves anymore (e.g. J.R.R. Tolkien). Mostly, this movie does the things it does because it CAN.

More often than not its due to ego or an inability to admit that a project you've labored so long and hard on is less than it could be. Such is the curse of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Based on a graphic novel written by the talented Alan Moore (Watchmen), League is less than the sum of its parts. There were times that the plot reeked of an old poorly written episode of The Wild, Wild West while at other times it was stirring entertainment.A masked madman going by the nom de plume of The Phantom has been using his army and machines to break into the best guarded banks of Europe. He's looting Europe in order to prove his power and then sell his machines to the highest bidders. His hope is that chaos and war will dominate Europe allowing him to have the world's nation's at his feet.Well known explorer Alan Quatermain is contacted by a member of Her Majesty's Government. It seems the Crown wants to lure Quatermain out of retirement from the beautiful plains of Africa. Quatermain at first refuses; he's tired of burying friends and lovers and has chosen a life without adventure. When thugs show up and try to murder Quatermain, he's in.He arrives in London at the secret headquarters of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. He meets ""M"" the director of Her Majesty's Secret Service (nice touch and reference to Connery's Bond past). ""M"" explains that this group has served Her Majesty secretly over the decades. The Phantom plans on attacking a meeting of the heads of state of various European countries. The meeting will take place in Venice within less than a week.Quatermain is the lynchpin in this new incarnation of the League. His job is to recruit the best with unusual abilities to stop the Phantom. Already recruited are Mina Harker and The Invisible Man. Harker's ability as a chemist makes her a natural. Oh, and she's a vampire as well. She only wants to use her abilities for the good fight. The Invisible Man, well he's not the original but he's got more personality; he's a pickpocket and a feisty man who loves dropping his trousers. The most mysterious is the brilliant Captain Nemo. Nemo's swordmanship, distaste for war and scientific brilliance make him a natural for the League. Quatermain may not care all too much for his new partners but he knows his duty and they travel off in to recruit two more members. From here the team recruits Dorian Gray, Mr. Hyde and Tom Sawyer.The film starts boldly and with a striking scene involving exploding zepplins and a massive war machine attacking the Bank of England. The scenes involving Connery at the beginning are also quite striking but the narrative loses some of its steam after they recruit all the members of the team.One of the weaknesses of the film is its narrative. The screenplay is like a wild amausement ride--upon closer examination you wonder what all the fuss was about.  The sequence in Venice is visually striking but the CGI work doesn't quite live up to expectations. Nor do the CGI sequences involving Mr. Hyde. Like The Hulk, it's clear he's computer generated. That wouldn't be the problem but the texture of the skin and the character just doesn't look believeable.On the plus side, the film captures some of the best elements of Moore's story but misses much of his magic. It's like a cake that doesn't rise; you know you took all the right steps and prepared everything the right way. You also know something was missing but can't quite figure out what. Perhaps the most important and vital element was any sort of character development. These characters are sketched in. Sure, it's based on a graphic novel (or comic book take your pick) but the best comic book adaptions (X-Men, Spiderman, Superman)do spend the time to develop the characters. Instead, the various characters explain why other characters behave the way they do. We should be able to observe it and not have it explained to us.The action sequences are well directed and many of the visuals are stunning. When Connery is on screen the film does gel more often than not through the sheer force of his charisma. Many of the cast also give it their best particularly the actor playing the mysterious, moody Captain Nemo. It's very clear that there was quite a bit of compromise and conflict around the making of this film. It would go a long way to explain the ambitious scope of the story and the limited way it is told.While it doesn't quite live up to its promise, League is an entertaining diversion with a number of twists and (some unbelievable) turns. I'm surprised that the film director's chose not to involve Sherlock Holmes in the film. Then again, Holmes would have figured out the mystery at the heart of the film within five minutes.Although it isn't completely successful, League manages to capture the audience's attention. When at its best, League manages to overcome the shortcomings in opticals, story and direction.  Connery's famous charisma manages to salvage much of the film and the rest of the performers turn in marvelously detailed moments.",3,Visually riveting League lacks enough substance,1071792000,"12 19,

I enjoyed it myself, as there was always enough happening and enough to look at on the screen to keep me entertained.  Sure, it wasn't perfect, but it was still better than something like that Hulk movie.  Setting it at the turn of the last century was fairly unique for this kind of movie.The concept of these historical characters of fiction banding together was handled pretty well.  It was intriguing to think about Mina Harker as a ""good"" vampire (like Angel on TV, I guess).  The special effects were effective, especially the mini-explosions that happen when Jeckyl is changing into Hyde or back.  There were a few nagging questions or criticisms inmy mind about things like how an evil Hyde can keep doing good things (although the film does attempt to explain it), but those did not bother me enough to become distracting.  The story pretty much carried me along from beginning to end and kept me interested.  I never found it ""boring"" as some people have.The only thing that really DID bother me was how blurry things got in many of the action scenes -- people and objects moving across the screen too fast for the eye to follow, the camera jumping around from point to point in confusing ways.

LXG also has some scenes that remind me of scenes in the Lord of the Rings movies. This movie is set at the turn of the century, in the 1890s. A threat to the world had developed from a character named the Phantom who would build machines of destruction and get countrys to turn against each other hoping to cause a World War.As a result, a man known only as M (and something else that I won't give away) calls together a group of Extraordinary Gentlemen (and Gentlewomen). The leader was Sean Connery, who was a hunter. Then there was an Immortal named Dorian Grey. There was a Beast named Mr. Hyde who was sometimes Dr. Jeckle. A woman that was bit by Dracula when her husband was hunting him was the vampire. There was also an Invisible man, and an American Spy that you didn't find out that he was Tom Sawyer after Mark Twain was done with him until the credits. And finally, the seventh Extraordinary gentleman was a scientest named Captan Nemo who had a submarine named the Nautalus.This group goes out to conqure evil and all that stuff, and not giving too much away, they are successful, and from the ending, I'll be expecting a sequel (which they tried to hard to achieve).Of course, this movie wasn't academy award worthy, but it's still worth seeing (mostly because it was so corny).

Moore took homage to DC Comics' team books in which their stable of characters (i.e. Superman, Batman, Flash, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern. etc) are put into one comic book in titles such as JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA and JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA; the characters share in on one adventure each month in the comic book.  In TLOEG famous literary characters are put into one adventure to save the world  (Allan Quatermain, Mina Harker, Tom Sawyer, Dorian Grey, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde). The film however takes its style of direction from the Jerry Bruckheimer school of moviemaking which is loud, 'in-your-face', and chaotic.  The film is reminiscent of the recent film ARMAGEDDON.  Sean Connery is a presence in everything he does and fares quite well as Allan Quatermain, and the standout character here is definitely Captain Nemo played by Naseeruddin Shah.  Peta Wilson as Mina Harker is another in a long list of unneeded vampire characters that have been flooding the movie market these days.  The 'Hyde' character is a parody upon itself looking like THE INCREDIBLE HULK (HULK was created by Stan Lee to be a cross between Frankenstein and Mr. Hyde in the first place). Lastly, the plot twists involving some of the characters' motives  (i.e. 'M', Dorian Grey, and The Invisible Man)  were not surprising, inventive, or justified. They were suddenly turned into bad guys just so the 'good' characters would have someone to fight with.  Overall, another failure of translating a comic-book into film and had the film been successful, the ending was set up for a sequel...Its not going to happen.  Note: It was reported that Sean Connery had a choice to do this film or to do LORD OF THE RINGS.  He chose TLOEG because he understood the material for the film, but did not understand 'RINGS'.",2,The League of Terrible Comic Book-To-Movie Adaptions.,1098230400,"10 20, 2004",2004,2184,"['One', 'films', 'where', 'inspiration', 'was', 'better', 'execution', 'THE', 'LEAGUE', 'OF', 'EXTRAORDINARY', 'GENTLEMEN', 'top-notch', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'overall', 'production', 'values', 'However', ""n't"", 'gel', 'TLOEG', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'miniseries', 'award', 'winning', 'novelist', 'comic', 'book', 'writer', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'better', 'comic', 'book', 'Moore', 'took', 'homage', 'DC', 'Comics', 'team', 'books', 'stable', 'characters', 'i.e', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'Flash', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'etc', 'are', 'put', 'one', 'comic', 'book', 'titles', 'such', 'JUSTICE', 'SOCIETY', 'OF', 'AMERICA', 'JUSTICE', 'LEAGUE', 'OF', 'AMERICA', 'characters', 'share', 'one', 'adventure', 'month', 'comic', 'book', 'TLOEG', 'famous', 'literary', 'characters', 'are', 'put', 'one', 'adventure', 'save', 'world', 'Allan', 'Quatermain', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Dorian', 'Grey', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Dr.', 'Henry', 'Jekyll/Edward', 'Hyde', 'film', 'however', 'style', 'direction', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'school', 'moviemaking', 'loud', ""'in-your-face"", 'chaotic', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'recent', 'film', 'ARMAGEDDON', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'presence', 'everything', 'quite', 'well', 'Allan', 'Quatermain', 'standout', 'character', 'here', 'definitely', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'played', 'Naseeruddin', 'Shah', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'Mina', 'Harker', 'long', 'list', 'unneeded', 'vampire', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'flooding', 'movie', 'market', 'days', ""'Hyde"", 'character', 'parody', 'looking', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLE', 'HULK', 'HULK', 'was', 'created', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'be', 'cross', 'Frankenstein', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'first', 'place', 'Lastly', 'plot', 'involving', 'characters', 'motives', 'i.e', 'Dorian', 'Grey', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'were', 'not', 'surprising', 'inventive', 'justified', 'were', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'bad', 'guys', 'just', 'so', ""'good"", 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'someone', 'fight', 'Overall', 'failure', 'translating', 'comic-book', 'film', 'had', 'film', 'been', 'successful', 'ending', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'sequel', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'Note', 'was', 'reported', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'had', 'choice', 'do', 'film', 'do', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'chose', 'TLOEG', 'understood', 'material', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'understand', ""'RINGS""]",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I'd say, like in the case of Jeff Linday's Dexter, the motion picture is way better than the novels.Do NOT let your opinion of the graphic novels influence you here at all.  If you are not a crazy fanboy who praises the boring, listless, unremarkable graphic novels nonsensically, then you will appreciate this film.  Where the books are slow and contain characters who do literally nothing yet are deemed heroes, this movie puts them all into the action and re-brands the foolishly lame characters of the books with seriously cool powers and attitudes.  Can anyone say &#34;Mina Harker?&#34;First of all, the idea is a great one.  This movie takes the idea and does the right thing: creates an action-packed story of some truly weird and scary heroes going against a powerful enemy on mankind's behalf.  It throws in Tom Sawyer as a secret agent.  It turns Alan Quartermain from a bumbling old fool into a tough-as-nails adventurer past his prime.The effects are excellent.  The acting is superb.  The characters are all very interesting, unique, and unsettling.If you enjoy the idea of monsters and special humans fighting for mankind, this film delivers.You might also love the John Carter and Underworld movies.",4,Much Better Than the Graphic Novels,1378598400,"09 8, 2013",2013,1294,"['Very', 'few', 'times', 'do', 'find', 'movie', 'better', 'source', 'material', ""'d"", 'say', 'case', 'Jeff', 'Linday', 'Dexter', 'motion', 'picture', 'way', 'better', 'novels.Do', 'NOT', 'let', 'opinion', 'graphic', 'novels', 'influence', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'crazy', 'fanboy', 'who', 'boring', 'listless', 'unremarkable', 'graphic', 'novels', 'nonsensically', 'then', 'will', 'appreciate', 'film', 'Where', 'books', 'are', 'slow', 'contain', 'characters', 'who', 'do', 'literally', 'nothing', 'yet', 'are', 'deemed', 'heroes', 'movie', 'action', 'foolishly', 'lame', 'characters', 'books', 'seriously', 'cool', 'powers', 'attitudes', 'Can', 'anyone', 'say', '34', 'Mina', 'Harker', '34', 'First', 'all', 'idea', 'great', 'one', 'movie', 'idea', 'right', 'thing', 'action-packed', 'story', 'truly', 'weird', 'scary', 'heroes', 'going', 'powerful', 'enemy', 'mankind', 'behalf', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'secret', 'agent', 'Alan', 'Quartermain', 'bumbling', 'old', 'fool', 'tough-as-nails', 'adventurer', 'prime.The', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'acting', 'superb', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'unique', 'enjoy', 'idea', 'monsters', 'special', 'humans', 'fighting', 'mankind', 'film', 'delivers.You', 'might', 'also', 'love', 'John', 'Carter', 'Underworld', 'movies']",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
