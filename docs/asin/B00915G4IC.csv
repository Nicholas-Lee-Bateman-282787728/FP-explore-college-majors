The old series had no lingering story lines but for Wo Fat, each episode was a stand alone gem. The men of Five-o dressed in suits and were classy, these new guys dress like bums, like they just walked into a bar on a Friday night. The musical score in the new series is loud, over the top and often just out of place with the content of the scenes. The editing is fast in your face, made for a child with ADD. The actors all look pretty much the same, no great character distinctions here.

Executive producer/writer Peter Lenkov grew up watching the original show, and he certainly has done it justice from the very first episode. III seasons later, HAWAII FIVE-0 has still got it: action, drama, suspense, light comedy and heart. Don't try to compare both shows because they're a product of the times they were created/developed for television.The acting is very good. Mr. O'Loughlin does a very good American accent, and every actor is perfectly cast. One major thing this reboot is known for is its shocking plot twists & major cliffhangers, and this one has them IN SPADES.

1582661,A2L64BVSRA9O4Z,B00915G4IC,Janalyn Robnett,"[31, 35]","It's funny. Usually the 3rd season of a series is the messed up one. Not in this case. The thing that makes this series for me is the bonding between the four main characters. Catherine is fine (let's face it, the actress who plays Steve's love-interest in this season is much better than the one who played the blonde what's-her-name in season 2. Sorry, I know that's harsh, but it is the truth.) But, I agree with a lot of others, there's no chemistry really between Catherine and Steve. It's like she's put in there to pursue, yet again, another love interest for him. My question? Why? He's not the type of guy to settle down, so the prospect of marriage is moot. Keep it simple, Writers. Catherine is a great character if used at a distance like she was used in first season. Her smarts and training are powerful, but we don't need 'Wonder Woman'. Use her sparingly and she'll be fine. The original 4 characters (along with Max, I mean, yeah, the guy actually adds to the dynamic of the series here, due to his being so unique in his mind-set and how he operates) are the ones we need to really focus on... although, there's been a huge effort to do just that season. Steve and Danno are really getting into the Bromance side of the equation which really makes this show for me. I've been searching for something like this ever since Starsky and Hutch went off the air in 1979.  I love Bromance and I'll search for it anywhere I can hopefully find it. Their arguments are funny, their bonding is touching and I adored the episode where we learned how Danny named Grace, when he told Steve of his partner Grace and his story of how he lost her... telling Steve as he faces down a movement-sensitive bomb. Steve staying there for him, talking to him, getting his mind off of moving, it was a great Bromance episode and the first one I bought on Amazon. The hug at the end was incredibly FELT by this viewer. And... it's great to see that homophobia hasn't hit this series. It's true, some series refuse to let the main male actors hug for fear that the fans will take the connection too far. Well, we do anyway, so keeping them from hugging when it's necessary is not going to change that. Sorry, but that's the way it is. The hug there was absolutely necessary and if it hadn't happened, I would have thrown up my hands and walked away. There's a time and place for everything. I love Chin and I love Kono and their incredible family relationship as well. Seeing how Kono is dealing with her love interest actually adds to the story-lines, so Adam is necessary here.

However, this year I actually found myself falling asleep several times!  I am not talking about gently dozing off, but fully fledged deep REM sleep.  Once I fell asleep in the middle of an episode only to be woken up 2-hours later when my snoring set off the security alarm!It is not unusual for a series to be presented with a main storyline that is broken up with ""filler"" episodes.  ""Person of Interest"" comes to mind.  However, the ""filler"" episodes have to be somewhat compelling to keep one vested to hang around while waiting for some resolution on the main storyline.The main storyline continues to be that of Wo Fat with this year's compelling twist being what is the relationship between Wo Fat and Steve's back from the dead mother (as evidenced by Ma McGarrett giving Wo a pass when having him dead to rights)?  I have no inside information on where this storyline is going, however, I wouldn't be surprised if based on the writing that there will be some ""soap opera"" like revelation where Wo Fat is actually Steve's half brother!What actually prompted this review is the most recent episode where the plot revolves around multiple bad guys who kidnap young children and keep them prisoner so that the family could get an additional $500-per month in welfare benefits?  I mean really?  $500-per month in Hawaii!  Someone in the State Records Dept. creating new ID's and a fake police officer who rather dramatically swallows her revolver rather than being arrested!  All over $500 per month in welfare benefits?  The episode in question is an early contender for the most ridiculous plot in an a North American series!Also, has anyone noticed the frequent hiatuses?  In the second half of the season there were gaps of 2-weeks twice and 4-weeks once between episodes.  It made it extremely difficult to stay vested.IMHO, Hawaii Five-O is migrating from a semi-interesting police drama to eye candy du jour where the highlight is a Grace Park shower scene or Michelle Borth in a bikini or a shirtless Alex O'Loughlin!I really do hope that the writers can turn this around, as currently, H5-O is not even the best series on Monday's @ 10PM.",3,News Flash!

They are snappish and stressed and... sensitive. The whole team needs some rebuilding and rebonding. Bringing in mom/Shelburne was maybe too much. I'd hoped to see the back of Wo Fat, but I guess I'm not that lucky. The rescue was way over the top.I was relieved when Mom was put on the plane heading out and away, because...wow she was hard to like.  Cath and Steve seem to be leading up to some kind of romance, but no chemistry there. Brother/sister vibe all the way.Episode 3, a Danny and Steve centric episode, buddies episode, my favorite kind. The carguments are always fabulous. But Danny was pretty tightly wound on the boat. No better word for it, he's bitchy in ep 3. It was nice to see a return to competent SEAL Steve.There have been some nice moments within the team in these first three episodes, and that is where I hope this season will go. Not dilute the team dynamic which along with the beautiful scenery, is the strength of the show. Good writing, good cases, stick with the team, that is all I'm asking. There does not need to be a forced romance.Kamekona and Max are great, Max is actually better this season. Weston left last year. Yay! Gabby faded away. Yay! I was sad to see Malia go, she and Chin had a great dynamic. Adam and Kono also feel like a good match, I'd like to see more of them. But Cath feels forced as a regular and as Steve's girlfriend.Not excited yet by this season yet. There have been a few promising moments. Got my fingers crossed.Adding on to my earlier review. Apparently I can't review episode by episode...So, in regard to Mohai the Halloween episode, I finally saw the brilliance of Danny&Steve; return. The two work together to solve a dreadful murder, bloody and gross. The back and forth is all there with none of the meanness that I saw earlier in the season. I'd say the season is improving.

If you're a fan of CSI/NCIS/Criminal Minds then the episode plots and character development isn't shocking or really original but if you can overlook that the show does still entertain.All that can be said is if you already have the first two seasons the third is worth adding into your collection and if you don't have any of the seasons I'd suggest getting the first one or watching it online if possible to see if you feel it's worth adding to your home t.v. series collection or not.,4,Alright Cop Drama Though Nothing Really New That Hasn't Been Seen Before,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,722,"['series', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'little', 'better', 'then', ""'d"", 'previously', 'thought', 'not', 'much', 'expected', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'have', 'popped', 'out', 'CBS', 'other', 'network', 'channels', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'so', ""'re"", 'fan', 'CSI/NCIS/Criminal', 'Minds', 'then', 'episode', 'plots', 'character', 'development', ""n't"", 'shocking', 'really', 'original', 'can', 'overlook', 'show', 'still', 'entertain.All', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'already', 'have', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'third', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'seasons', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'getting', 'first', 'one', 'watching', 'online', 'possible', 'see', 'feel', 'worth', 'adding', 'home', 't.v', 'series', 'collection', 'not']",Hawaii Five-0: Season 3
