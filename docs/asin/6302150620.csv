The acting, writing, directing, music, and design are all perfect. It touched me  so deeply--because I could relate to many aspects of the story--that I thought about it for days. It never lost its believability and drew me deeper and deeper into its vortex of romantic suspense. Megee's self-sacrifice--placing Ralph's career above her own needs and desires--was so admirable. And her unfliching faithfulness to him despite her lonliness, if not emptiness, was even more divine than the faithfulness Ralph professed to God. She becomes a true heroine but in a different way, an inner way, than we usually think of heroines.A truly great, memorable, monumental achievement--one that many persons on many levels can and will appreciate for many years to come. I will never sell my copy--so much pleasure has it given me!--and I will probably watch it at least once a year. If you haven't yet seen it, please do--and discover an experience unlike any you have ever had in movie-going!And Oh yes, make sure you've got a good supply of tissues, instead of popcorn, at your side--you'll really need them!

I am pleased to now own the DVD which has remained remarkably popular over the years.  There is another simple reason why I have always loved this mini-series.  When the program first aired on television in March 1983, it was television that was able to lift the spirits of my mother who had been battling breast cancer for one year and was in the last weeks of her life.  She watched the mini-series while in the hospital and passed away two months later.  The Thorn Birds is a mini-series that resonates with most Roman Catholics because of its thought provoking insights of the Catholic faith and has a pleasant story line of a loving and hard working family.  I think of my mom each time I watch it.  It was the only television program that was able to make her smile during that time, and she and my father were devout Catholics.  Richard Chamberlain, Sydney Penny, Rachel Ward, Bryan Brown, Jean Simmons, Richard Kiley, Barbara Stanwyck, and Christopher Plummer and many others made a brilliant cast.  The Thorn Birds is a classic that will always be my favorite mini-series.  Something else about this cast is that both Jean Simmons and Richard Kiley during the 1990s were the narrator voices behind ""Mysteries of the Bible"" that aired on A&E.  This mini-series is a true classic.",5,The Thorn Birds - excellent mini-series,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,1435,"['years', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'remained', 'favorite', 'mini-series', 'content', 'cast', 'acting', 'musical', 'score', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'am', 'pleased', 'now', 'own', 'DVD', 'remained', 'remarkably', 'popular', 'years', 'simple', 'reason', 'why', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'mini-series', 'When', 'program', 'first', 'aired', 'television', 'March', '1983', 'was', 'television', 'was', 'able', 'lift', 'spirits', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'battling', 'breast', 'cancer', 'one', 'year', 'was', 'last', 'weeks', 'life', 'watched', 'mini-series', 'hospital', 'passed', 'away', 'two', 'months', 'later', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'mini-series', 'most', 'Roman', 'Catholics', 'thought', 'provoking', 'insights', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'pleasant', 'story', 'line', 'loving', 'hard', 'working', 'family', 'think', 'mom', 'time', 'watch', 'was', 'only', 'television', 'program', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'smile', 'time', 'father', 'were', 'devout', 'Catholics', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'Sydney', 'Penny', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'many', 'others', 'made', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'classic', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'mini-series', 'Something', 'else', 'cast', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Richard', 'Kiley', '1990s', 'were', 'narrator', 'voices', 'Mysteries', 'Bible', 'aired', 'A', 'E', 'mini-series', 'true', 'classic']",N/A

298184,A141HP4LYPWMSR,6302150620,Brian E. Erland,"[4, 4]","The `70's and early `80's were the ""Golden Age"" of the television mini-series producing such excellent films as; `QB VII' ('74), `Rich Man, Poor Man' ('76), `Roots' ('77), `Shogun' ('80) and of course `The Thorn Birds' ('83).`The Thorn Birds' boasts an excellent cast of well-knowns and lesser-knowns along with some bright, new faces that for the most part delivered the most memorable performances of the production. Of course if you've seen the film you already know that when I speak of bright new faces I'm primary referring to the enchanting, adorable Sydney Penny in the role of little Meggie Cleary as the child who steals the heart of Father Ralph de Bricassart (Richard Chamberlain), the ambitious Catholic priest who is to become trapped forever between his desires for both divine and human love.The first half of the film featuring Sydney Penny is by far my favorite. Her relationship with the adoring Priest is innocent and nurturing and Sydney's smile lights up the screen with such warmth and love you can't help but fall in love with both her and the storyline.Eventually Meggie grows up and is replaced by the stunning Rachel Ward, definitely not a bad swap but unfortunately from that point onward the film takes on the mood and texture of a harlequin romance dominated by Father Ralph's inability to act decisively and choose who he loves more, God or Meggie. The portrayal of his constant ""inner struggle"" made the plot a little too redundant at times. I think if I had heard him say ""but I love God more"" just one more time I might go mad.Of course what irritates one viewer is quite often just what other viewers are looking for and I'm certain that some of what I've written will be preceived as a lack of sensitivity and experience in the ways of the heart (such is the fate of men). Be that as it may, the long enduring popularity of this film certainly cannot be denied, nor dismissed and its long overdue release on DVD is without doubt going to find a large, passionate audience anxiously awaiting to have their hearts broken all over again.My Rating: -4  Stars-.",4,"""What Sin Did You Commit?"" ~ Necessary Sacrifices On The Journey To Becoming The Perfect Priest",1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,2092,"['70', 'early', '80', 'were', 'Golden', 'Age', 'television', 'mini-series', 'producing', 'such', 'excellent', 'films', 'QB', 'VII', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'Roots', 'Shogun', 'course', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'boasts', 'excellent', 'cast', 'well-knowns', 'lesser-knowns', 'bright', 'new', 'most', 'part', 'delivered', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'production', 'course', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'already', 'know', 'when', 'speak', 'bright', 'new', ""'m"", 'primary', 'referring', 'enchanting', 'adorable', 'Sydney', 'Penny', 'role', 'little', 'Meggie', 'Cleary', 'child', 'who', 'heart', 'Father', 'Ralph', 'Bricassart', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'ambitious', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'who', 'become', 'trapped', 'forever', 'desires', 'divine', 'human', 'love.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'featuring', 'Sydney', 'Penny', 'far', 'favorite', 'relationship', 'adoring', 'Priest', 'innocent', 'nurturing', 'Sydney', 'smile', 'up', 'screen', 'such', 'warmth', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'storyline.Eventually', 'Meggie', 'up', 'replaced', 'stunning', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'definitely', 'not', 'bad', 'swap', 'unfortunately', 'point', 'onward', 'film', 'mood', 'texture', 'harlequin', 'romance', 'dominated', 'Father', 'Ralph', 'inability', 'act', 'decisively', 'choose', 'who', 'more', 'God', 'Meggie', 'portrayal', 'constant', 'inner', 'struggle', 'made', 'plot', 'little', 'too', 'redundant', 'times', 'think', 'had', 'heard', 'say', 'love', 'God', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'might', 'go', 'mad.Of', 'course', 'what', 'one', 'viewer', 'quite', 'often', 'just', 'what', 'other', 'viewers', 'are', 'looking', ""'m"", 'certain', 'what', ""'ve"", 'written', 'will', 'be', 'preceived', 'lack', 'sensitivity', 'experience', 'ways', 'heart', 'such', 'fate', 'men', 'Be', 'may', 'long', 'enduring', 'popularity', 'film', 'certainly', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'dismissed', 'long', 'overdue', 'release', 'DVD', 'doubt', 'going', 'find', 'large', 'passionate', 'audience', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'have', 'hearts', 'again.My', 'Rating', '-4', 'Stars-']",N/A

I had remembered seeing part of it with my Mom on TV when I was younger, so I finally decided to buy it last year. Let me just tell you, it has spoken out to me like no other movie ever had. I even read the book, which was equally wonderful, although the movie differs a bit. The actors were perfect for their parts and all critics acclaimed Barbara Stanwyck who won a Golden Globe for her haunting role as Mary Carson. Next, there is Christopher Plummer who was the best Vittorio Scarbanza di Contini-Verchese, he directly sees through Ralph's act. He knows the rose is his torment. Which brings me to Richard Chamberlain and Rachel Ward who fit beautifully in the portrayal of Ralph and Meggie. Ralph, who is so driven by his supposedly ""holy"" ambitions and love for God, that he leaves Meggie, as a sacrafice, all those sacrifice. He even gives her a son, but the Cardinal de Bricassart in him takes up too much place in that beach-ball sized head of his. Meggie has never loved anybody else, and while trying to forget her desire for Ralph that will never go away, she finds more trouble. Jean Simmons is terribly good as the ever-so-cold Fiona Cleary, who is always so feelingless. The rest of the supporting cast are also very good, especially Mare Winningham who plays the fiery Justine, Piper Laurie, the true Anne Mueller and Richard Kiley, the Paddy Cleary McCullough's book deserves.This is a story about pride and human nature, of forbidden love and principles. I cried and cried when Ralph leaves Meggie on Matlock Island, when Meggie tells Ralph Dane was his son and when she reconciles with her Mum, who was always so out of reach for her. The final scene is also one of the best. The legend of THE THORN BIRDS is the main asset that will make you love the book and the movie. And in the movie, you have the wonderful score that truly sets the mood, crafted by the very talented Henry Mancini.For those who love love stories, none of that cheezy romantic comedy phony ""love"", but the true one that makes you love a drama. I give you THE THORN BIRDS. The best!Enjoy it!P.S.: There is no sountrack album available for this movie but you can find The Thorn Birds suite on the Henry Mancini CD ""Premiere Pops"". On a second note, there is a sequel called THE THORN BIRDS : THE MISSING YEARS, that happens in the middle of the 1983 mini-series. Only Richard Chamberlain comes back back for that 1996 TV Movie.

The story of Meggie Cleary and Father Ralph de Bricassart is timeless and is as riveting today as it was in 1983.  Love, unrequited and forbidden, greed, ambition and power are all at the crux of this story which spans 60 years in the lives of the Cleary family and Richard Chamberlain along with Rachel Ward portray the main characters to absolute perfection.  There are many stand-out performances in this acclaimed Mini Series but there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest...the performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Mary Carson.  It is her character from whom all other people and events spring.  Stanwyck enjoyed a stellar career in Hollywood and was seen as Hollywood royalty for many years.  Her films are among the best ever made and she was nominated for many, many awards throughout her career.  No stranger to television, having had two very successful series of her own, she took on the role of Mary Carson at the age of 76!  This was to be the last major role of her career and I believe it was her crowning achievement as an actress.  Watching her weave her special brand of magic on screen as she portrays this complex woman, is the stuff from which legends are made and that which students of acting should take a lesson from. Her final scene is one that will send chills up and down your spine. She is nothing short of superb!  Jean Simmons, Richard Kiley, Bryan Brown, Christopher Plummer, Barry Corbin, Earl Holliman, Piper Laurie, Ken Howard and Sydney Penny as the young Meggie Cleary are just some of the actors who made The Thorn Birds so memorable and who hand in great performances..

298194,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,6302150620,Chris Luallen,"[11, 37]","First let me find a few good things to say about ""The Thorn Birds"". I enjoyed watching the attractive Australian landscapes and seeing the story develop over a historical period spanning several decades. But the bottom line is that this miniseries plays out like a trashy romance novel, with one dimensional characters, overly melodramatic and all too obvious plot twists and a moral perspective that I found highly disturbing.The most troubling aspect is that Father Ralph and Meggie begin to develop their ""special relationship"" when she is only age 10.  Considering all the problems involving Catholic priests and the sexual abuse of children I am very suprised that few other reviewers have commented on the undertones of pedophilia this movie clearly suggests. Certainly Mary, the elderly ranch matron who lusted after Ralph, noticed their ""special relationship"" and was very jealous of it. The author Colleen McCullough sees herself as someone ""pushing the envelope"" on sexual taboos as evidenced by her references to the writers Henry Miller and D.H. Lawrence, both controverisal in their time for their explicit writings on sex. But, while I am OK with McCullough writing about the elderly Mary's lust for Ralph and even Ralph's willingness to break his priestly vows to be with Meggie, I found the depiction of Ralph and 10 year old Meggie's ""special relationship"" to definitely cross the line into something perverted and very wrong. I know it is shown how he suddenly falls in love with her one night at a party after she has turned 18. But this couldn't be ""love at first sight"" as he had known her and gone out of his way to spend time with her over the previous 8 years and that ""special feelings"" had already formed between them. All the signs of pedophilia exist here even if the movie never shows an act of sexual abuse occurring.The rest of the movie bored me for the most part.

298206,AAOT8ZNO94H0V,6302150620,Dean Anderson,"[16, 18]","ABC (but perhaps more accurately, David Wolper) set the standard for the Miniseries, or ""novels for television"" in the mid 1970s through the 80s. First ""Rich Man, Poor Man,"" which launched the genre in 1976, then the blockbuster epic ""Roots"" the following year, and then this next major event: Colleen McCullough's best seller, ""The Thorn Birds,"" which first aired in 1983.All of the key elements are there: a sweeping story set in an intriguing locale (in this case, a rural area farm in Australia), and an emotional topic (in this case, variations of unrequited love).It begins with a parish priest named Father Ralph, who is doted upon by the old woman who owns the sheep farm, run by a working class family. Barbara Stanwyck gives one of her final and one of her best scenery-chewing performances here, as the boss lady who forces her quarry to make a tough choice, and Richard Chamberlain matches her as the priest who finds his own special treasure, the young daughter of the farm's caretakers, Meggie, (played by child actor Sydney Penny).As Meggie grows, so does Father Ralph's ambition, and his ascent towards the upper ranks of the Catholic Church begins, just as his descent into his feelings for the now adult Meggie (Rachel Ward) also happens.With a stellar cast and such earth shattering subject matter as breaking vows of celibacy, the grasp for power, true love v. true vocation and the agony and dilemma of dealing with the choices one makes along the path of life, through love and loss, there's plenty of ground to cover, from the dirt roads of an Outback farm to the glittering brilliance of the Holy See.In addition to the miniseries itself, you get one important extra here: a look back on the landmark television event by the principal players in the project titled ""The Thorn Birds: Old Friends, New Stories,"" a documentary shot in 2003.This short film features Exec. Producer David Wolper, Chamberlain, Ward, and her husband that she met on the set, Bryan Brown (the only Aussie working on the project!) all chatting merrily about the events surrounding the filming. Some very amusing behind-the-scenes stories are told here that must be seen!But really, it's all about the tear-jerking tale with a score by the legendary Henry Mancini, one of the most chest-clutching romantic classics in TV history!Highly recommended.",4,"Playing With Morals, Outback And Down Under",1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,2345,"['ABC', 'perhaps', 'more', 'accurately', 'David', 'Wolper', 'set', 'standard', 'Miniseries', 'novels', 'television', 'mid', '1970s', '80s', 'First', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'launched', 'genre', '1976', 'then', 'blockbuster', 'epic', 'Roots', 'following', 'year', 'then', 'next', 'major', 'event', 'Colleen', 'McCullough', 'best', 'seller', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'first', 'aired', '1983.All', 'key', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'sweeping', 'story', 'set', 'intriguing', 'locale', 'case', 'rural', 'area', 'farm', 'Australia', 'emotional', 'topic', 'case', 'variations', 'unrequited', 'love', '.It', 'parish', 'priest', 'named', 'Father', 'Ralph', 'who', 'doted', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'sheep', 'farm', 'run', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'one', 'final', 'one', 'best', 'scenery-chewing', 'performances', 'here', 'boss', 'lady', 'who', 'quarry', 'make', 'tough', 'choice', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'priest', 'who', 'own', 'special', 'treasure', 'young', 'daughter', 'farm', 'caretakers', 'Meggie', 'played', 'child', 'actor', 'Sydney', 'Penny', '.As', 'Meggie', 'grows', 'so', 'Father', 'Ralph', 'ambition', 'ascent', 'upper', 'ranks', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'just', 'descent', 'feelings', 'now', 'Meggie', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'also', 'happens.With', 'stellar', 'cast', 'such', 'earth', 'shattering', 'subject', 'matter', 'breaking', 'vows', 'celibacy', 'grasp', 'power', 'true', 'love', 'v.', 'true', 'vocation', 'agony', 'dilemma', 'dealing', 'choices', 'one', 'path', 'life', 'love', 'loss', 'plenty', 'ground', 'cover', 'dirt', 'roads', 'Outback', 'farm', 'glittering', 'brilliance', 'Holy', 'See.In', 'addition', 'miniseries', 'get', 'one', 'important', 'extra', 'here', 'look', 'back', 'landmark', 'television', 'event', 'principal', 'players', 'project', 'titled', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'Old', 'Friends', 'New', 'Stories', 'documentary', 'shot', '2003.This', 'short', 'film', 'features', 'Exec', 'Producer', 'David', 'Wolper', 'Chamberlain', 'Ward', 'husband', 'met', 'set', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'only', 'Aussie', 'working', 'project', 'chatting', 'merrily', 'events', 'surrounding', 'filming', 'very', 'amusing', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'here', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'really', 'tear-jerking', 'tale', 'score', 'legendary', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'one', 'most', 'chest-clutching', 'romantic', 'classics', 'TV', 'history', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

There is really only one glaring flaw in this production, and it is that at the end of each section (there are 4 in all) there are snippets of foreshadowing taken from what will happen in the next section that are shown in montage form as a teaser to get the viewers to come back and watch.  It made sense when showing it on television to try and sustain the viewers' interest in this way, but on DVD it was a little annoying to see major plot elements revealed before I saw them unfold in due time.  I wish that someone would have edited these snippets out for the DVD release.  However, that is my only gripe.  The story, acting, immense production value, and the romance all combine to create a fine show.  The sheer size of this production is impressive, but it is the characters that are eventually the most memorable aspect of the story.  It wasn't until the end of the show that I realized I had formed an emotional connection to the characters that transcended the time in which this show was made.  I was transported into their world, if only for a short while.  It is certainly a journey worth taking.  The price for this DVD package is excellent, as well.

The Stanwyk character was deplorable esp. with the line: on my mouth! YIKES!!! The aging process was well done for Cardinal Vittorio, Ralph, Grandma Fi, BUT Meggie looks more gorgeous every year, esp. the last scene, they tried to grey her hair, tho unevenly, during the same scene and nary a wrinkle....no biggie compared to her whisper yelling and flat dialogue, but very beautiful woman...Justine was prolly the worst cast in the series, waaay too wooden for a bohemian, maladjusted, wild child, head movements were even too stilted and not pretty enough to be Meggie's daughter...Dane portrayed the deepest expression of character as supported by the other family members and was very touching.  I could not believe that his two good looking uncles stayed unmmarried, very strange...and the young Meghan had too mature dialogue for believability, with her bold questions and observations that nary an adult would deliver or even have elevated critical thinking skills during that era....apologies for my stream of consciousness review here but thankfully not a PhD thesis...also, never understood the reasons for not telling Ralph about Dane 'cept for the heart wrenching reveal at the end which IMHO was theee best scene in the series...great crying jag Richard!!! I cried too....anyhow, my biggest dissapointment was the ending with Ralph decrying that ""WE always go for it"" (?) i.e. the thorn bird's sole joy of life or something to that effect when I felt that is the last thing either of them did....Ralph especially, he fought that ""song"" to his death, and loved the inital description of the Thorn Bird myth but never saw the parallel in the series....nice try but would have liked him to reject the church and had his final days with Meggie and fade out TRYING to be that Thorn Bird but failing....well, I know Aussies and back then they must have treated their women worse than they do now....Bryan Brown was delightful but character development flawed with the devotion and conviction of needing a woman and love to... how can I impress the wankers cutting cane???...they just didn't flesh out a believable character, And what is up with the D. H. Lawrence and Henry Miller references? Lady Chatterly's Lover is so out of place for a cripple, 50's mentality, Australlia, and farmer IQ types...did Colleen try to impress the audience with her breadth of literary repertoire? so to wrap up....I watched every episode, sometimes twice, and worked my schedule around this series as I had not seen it since 1983 after reading the book...I rarely do this and my friends razzed me about it but I was hoping for a recapture of my life 25 years ago, but what I found is a deeper understanding of loss, patiently waiting for love, and how to overcome adversity, kudos for the enjoyment but had to comment on my issues with the production.

Beautifully filmed (in California) this is the chronicle of the Cleary family and Father Ralph de Bricassart.  Really loved watching it again after so many years have passed since it first played on television.  Something that occurred to me that I didn't think of before.  How could a man fall in love with a woman that he watched growing up?  Fr. Ralph said he loved Meggie like she was his own child.  Then when he sees her again after many years away, and she's grown into a beautiful young woman, he falls in love with her.  I don't think that was very realistic.  I found the story so tragic.  Meggie always knew her mother didn't love her the way she loved her sons, especially her first born Frank.  That woman Fee, played by Jean Simmons was such a cold fish, I just wanted to slap her.  Then Meggie turns around and treats her own daughter the same way.  And I couldn't understand Meggie not going to her son's ordination.  Mary Carson, played by Barbara Stanwick was such a bitch.

The miniseries is not completely accurate to Colleen McCullough's best seling novel, but is still an emmy award winning program with talented cast (Richard Kiley, Jean Simmons, Ken Howard, Mare Winningham, Philip Anglim, Bryan Brown, Barbara Stanwyck, Earl Holliman, Piper Laurie and more). With the whole thing on 2 discs, it's a shame that they didn't include, the failed ""Missing Years"" film also starring Chamberlain (this time with Amanda Donohoe), but I am buying this anyway because it was far superior, and I have other uses for the 8 hour tape I used when I taped it years ago.

I would like to point out the following:1) She was extraordinarily beautiful, hard to look away from when she was on-screen.  It was plausible that a priest or any other man would be drawn to her.  I can't imagine a better-cast Meggie than Rachel Ward.2) Ward did a remarkable job of portraying convincing love scenes with a gay actor (Richard Chamberlain).  I do not know if the cast was aware of his proclivity.  If nothing else, Ward's gaydar may have signaled her to the truth of Chamberlain's orientation.  Both actors deserve credit for pulling this off.3) The reality on the set was that Ward had found her ""masculine counterpart"" in Bryan Brown.  They would marry, raise a family, and see one of their daughters act on screen.  Kudos to Ward for convincing the camera (and everyone else) that Richard Chamberlain was the love of her life.4) Unforgettable goodbye scene #1: Meggie parting ways with Ralph on Matlock Island.  I admit I was rather young when I first saw this, but I felt terribly torn and grieved watching this scene.  The only comparably wrenching scene that comes to mind is Debra Winger saying goodbye to her kids in Terms of Endearment.5) Unforgettable goodbye scene #2: the riveting portrayal of Meggie telling Luke their marriage was over.  She was a commanding presence, lancing Luke's ego with surgical precision.  Don't feel badly for him.

It is a really solid story and has a strong cast.For Australians the use of American accents in the reputed outback Australia is pretty jarring as it is much more 'ranch life in the US' to our perception. I gather the Aussie Government rules at the time made it difficult to film it here as it would have been done now. However if they had peopled it with the sort of extreme Aussie accent Bryan Brown uses in it I can understand the preference (we dont all talk like that and it can perplex many of us too!)The aging makeup was primitive at the time this series was made but the filming is generally acceptable in a modern viewpoint.I think Barbara Stanwick gives a performance that is truly noteworthy. However it has to be said that this is Richard Chamberlain's series. He is just incredibly good and draws your attention whenever he is on the screen. His theatre background gives him a dimension that allows him to draw everything possible out of his lines and gestures and is a delight to watch. My estimation of him as an actor has risen yet again on revisiting and I intend re-exploring his other older stuff.In the DVD recent interviews it is clear he is as radiant in real life as he is on screen - and joyful and generous to others as well.I find from the interviews (that are included on the DVD as extras) the supreme irony that some of the best heterosexual love scenes ever played out on TV (as it still is on revisiting) were not only played by a gay star (as Richard has since come out as being) but by one who was working with an emotionally inhibited straight co-star. Co-star Rachel Ward talks of how 'embarrassing' love scenes are for her (and in the days when she wasnt required to take her clothes off!) yet Richard talks of the importance of the scene for his character and how he approached it with joy! The success of those scenes then flows almost entirely from Richard and remains a shining romantic moment in cinema history.Apparently Jane Seymour was considered for Rachel's part. The way Rachel responds to questions about the series makes you wish they had gone with that choice - though Rachel was generally OK in that role. I doubt whether with Jane's professionalism she would have said she'd gone to the US to find a husband as the reason she'd taken the part as Rachel does! Perhaps that's partly Rachel's attempt at a 'blokey humour' that she seems to favour. There is none of the generosity towards Richard from her, or since husband Bryan Brown, that they received and this stinginess is notable by contrast.This series has a much slower pace than we are now used to but it is worth savouring the journey. One patch in the novel and the series I even found slow at the time (in the canefield years) but the advantage of DVD is being able to jump or fast forward over the slower bits on revisiting if you wish!In short - great story still, and watch it for Richard - a much underrated and too often overlooked actor.",4,Well worth revisiting & Richard Chamberlain is a delight,1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,3040,"['definitely', 'worth', 'revisiting', 'liked', 'series', 'even', 'read', 'book', 'really', 'solid', 'story', 'strong', 'cast.For', 'Australians', 'use', 'American', 'accents', 'reputed', 'outback', 'Australia', 'pretty', 'jarring', 'much', 'more', ""'ranch"", 'life', 'US', 'perception', 'gather', 'Aussie', 'Government', 'rules', 'time', 'made', 'difficult', 'film', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'now', 'However', 'had', 'peopled', 'sort', 'extreme', 'Aussie', 'accent', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'can', 'understand', 'preference', 'dont', 'talk', 'can', 'perplex', 'many', 'too', 'aging', 'makeup', 'was', 'primitive', 'time', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'filming', 'generally', 'acceptable', 'modern', 'viewpoint.I', 'think', 'Barbara', 'Stanwick', 'performance', 'truly', 'noteworthy', 'However', 'be', 'said', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'series', 'just', 'incredibly', 'good', 'draws', 'attention', 'screen', 'theatre', 'background', 'dimension', 'draw', 'everything', 'possible', 'lines', 'gestures', 'delight', 'watch', 'estimation', 'actor', 'risen', 'yet', 'again', 'revisiting', 'intend', 're-exploring', 'other', 'older', 'DVD', 'recent', 'interviews', 'clear', 'radiant', 'real', 'life', 'screen', 'joyful', 'generous', 'others', 'well.I', 'find', 'interviews', 'are', 'included', 'DVD', 'extras', 'supreme', 'irony', 'best', 'heterosexual', 'love', 'scenes', 'ever', 'played', 'out', 'TV', 'still', 'revisiting', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'played', 'gay', 'star', 'Richard', 'come', 'out', 'being', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'working', 'emotionally', 'inhibited', 'straight', 'co-star', 'Co-star', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'talks', 'how', ""'embarrassing"", 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'days', 'when', 'wasnt', 'required', 'take', 'clothes', 'yet', 'Richard', 'talks', 'importance', 'scene', 'character', 'how', 'approached', 'joy', 'success', 'scenes', 'then', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Richard', 'shining', 'romantic', 'moment', 'cinema', 'history.Apparently', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'was', 'considered', 'Rachel', 'part', 'way', 'Rachel', 'questions', 'series', 'wish', 'had', 'gone', 'choice', 'Rachel', 'was', 'generally', 'OK', 'role', 'doubt', 'Jane', 'professionalism', 'would', 'have', 'said', ""'d"", 'gone', 'US', 'find', 'husband', 'reason', ""'d"", 'taken', 'part', 'Rachel', 'Perhaps', 'partly', 'Rachel', 'attempt', ""'blokey"", 'humour', 'favour', 'none', 'generosity', 'towards', 'Richard', 'husband', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'received', 'stinginess', 'notable', 'contrast.This', 'series', 'much', 'slower', 'pace', 'are', 'now', 'used', 'worth', 'savouring', 'journey', 'One', 'patch', 'novel', 'series', 'even', 'found', 'slow', 'time', 'canefield', 'years', 'advantage', 'DVD', 'being', 'able', 'jump', 'fast', 'forward', 'slower', 'bits', 'revisiting', 'wish', 'short', 'great', 'story', 'still', 'watch', 'Richard', 'much', 'underrated', 'too', 'often', 'overlooked', 'actor']",N/A

298258,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6302150620,Nix Pix,"[5, 7]","&quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; has become that pinnacle of masterful storytelling for all small screen melodramas by which every subsequent miniseries has been compared. Based on the sweeping family saga spanning from the 1920s to 1962 and penned by Colleen McCullough, Daryl Duke directs an all-star cast including Richard Chamberlain (Father Ralph), Rachel Ward (Meggy) and Jean Simmons (Fiona). The story - just in case you weren't one of the millions who tuned in - revolves around rich widow, Mary Carson?s (Barbara Stanwyck) bittersweet lust for Father Ralph de Bricassart. After rejecting Mary?s advances, Father Ralph's faith in God is put to the test when, upon Mary?s death, it is revealed that she has bequeathed him her Australian outback estate. Mary knows that if Ralph loves God as much as he says he does then he will allow the estate to revert back to the Clearys, the family to whom it rightfully belongs. If, however, as Mary has predicted, Ralph desires the post of Cardinal more than doing God?s will, he will turn over the estate to the Catholic diocese in order to procure his seat in the Vatican. Ralph?s faith is further complicated by his bittersweet romance with the passionate Meggy. Unable to choose between her and servitude to the church, Ralph takes a temporary leave of his duties, seduces and impregnates Meggy, then returns to the false piety of his calling. Meggy?s bitterness toward Ralph?s rejection leads her to keep her pregnancy a secret. Their son, Dane (Philip Anglim) grows up and desires to become a priest. Though Meggy is disappointed, she allows Ralph to re-enter Dane?s life, only as his spiritual guide. It is only after Dane tragically drowns that Meggy feels exonerated into exposing the truth to her one time lover ? that Dane was actually his son.Masterful performances and outstanding production values made ?The Thorn Birds? one of the greatest and most watched television melodramas of the 1980s. Only ABC?s miniseries, ?North And South? comes close to authenticating the visceral emotions captured in this eight hour plus melodrama. Christopher Plummer, Richard Kiley, Mare Winningham, Piper Laurie and Ken Howard also costar.The transfer is overall pleasing. A well balanced picture with somewhat dated colors and a bit of haze greet the eye on this 2-disc edition. Flesh tones are a tad pasty and age related artifacts abound throughout. Blacks are solid and deep. Contrast levels are generally good. Fine details disappear during some of the darker scenes. It should be noted that television film stock of this vintage was generally not up to today?s standards and the resulting shortcomings in video quality on this DVD presentation stem from those shortcomings, NOT as a result of the mastering effort put forth herein. The audio is dated but nicely balanced.Extras include an all too short documentary in which several cast members reminisce about their experiences while making the series.

298263,A2O59M48Z3QNIJ,6302150620,Polly M. Moreno,"[15, 18]","Based on the novel by Colleen McCullough, this captivating miniseries was warmly embraced by viewers and critics alike when it aired in four installments in 1983.The provocative story of a handsome, ambitious priest, torn between his love of God, power, and the beautiful Meggie Cleary, resonated with audiences worldwide, making ""The Thorn Birds"" the second highest rated miniseries of all time.  The ten hour production was beautifully made, and the stellar cast and haunting musical score combined to make ""The Thorn Birds"" an award winning television landmark.  The movie provided a wealth of memorable performances, most notably from Barbara Stanwyck, Rachel Ward, Sydney Penney, Jean Simmons, and Christopher Plummer.The highest accolades go to Richard Chamberlain for his extraordinary portrayal of Ralph de Bricassart, the tormented Catholic priest whose conflicting loves and inner turmoil provide the heart and soul of the entire series.  Father Ralph is a character of multiple contradictions, and Mr. Chamberlain masterfully brings these complexities to the screen.  From his first tender scenes with the young Meggie, (a sensational Sydney Penney,) to his final poignant scenes with the adult Meggie in the rose garden 40 years later, Richard Chamberlain is mesmerizing and unforgettable in this, his most famous role.  Robert Redford, Peter Strauss, and Christopher Reeves were some of the noteworthy names who were at one time considered for the part of Father Ralph--thankfully, the Executive Producer's wife was the one who suggested Richard Chamberlain.  His portrayal of Ralph de Bricassart remains one of the most memorable and best loved characterizations in television history.The series won numerous awards, including an Emmy for best film editing.  The superior work done by the editors is evident throughout the entire 10 hours, but two terrific scenes deserve mention.  The first is when a transfixed Father Ralph sees the breathtaking Meggie descending the stairs in her ""Ashes of Roses"" gown, and the second is the montage of film of Meggie's wedding to Luke in Australia, intertwined with Ralph's ordination in Rome as a Bishop.  Both of these scenes are superb examples of how expert editing adds immeasurably to the overall quality of the final production.  The musical score by Henry Mancini is outstanding as well--it is ludicrous he was not awarded the Emmy for his brilliant theme that provides the perfect backdrop to the emotional story line.The only negative for me in the epic saga of ""The Thorn Birds"" has to do with the extremely ungracious comments of the author of the novel, Colleen McCullough, regarding this highly respected and acclaimed production.  I realize she is not the only writer to be dissatisfied with the final rendition of her work to the screen, but a simple ""no comment"" would have sufficed, and would have been infinitely more classy.  Instead, she describes the miniseries as ""instant vomit,"" and goes on to say that none of the exemplary cast could even act.  I would remind Ms. McCullough that many of the actors and actresses in this television production were recognized for their work by both the Golden Globes and the Emmys, the gold standard of their craft.  Saying the likes of Richard Chamberlain and Barbara Stanwyck can not act is like saying Colleen McCullough can not write--a really ridiculous statement, and very mean spirited.  I would also add that 110 million viewers of this beloved miniseries adamantly disagree with her.",5,Unforgettable Miniseries With A Truly Luminous Performance by Richard Chamberlain,1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,3504,"['Based', 'novel', 'Colleen', 'McCullough', 'captivating', 'miniseries', 'was', 'warmly', 'embraced', 'viewers', 'critics', 'alike', 'when', 'aired', 'four', 'installments', '1983.The', 'provocative', 'story', 'handsome', 'ambitious', 'priest', 'torn', 'love', 'God', 'power', 'beautiful', 'Meggie', 'Cleary', 'resonated', 'audiences', 'worldwide', 'making', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'second', 'highest', 'rated', 'miniseries', 'time', 'ten', 'hour', 'production', 'was', 'beautifully', 'made', 'stellar', 'cast', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'combined', 'make', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'award', 'winning', 'television', 'landmark', 'movie', 'provided', 'wealth', 'memorable', 'performances', 'most', 'notably', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'Sydney', 'Penney', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Christopher', 'Plummer.The', 'highest', 'accolades', 'go', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'extraordinary', 'portrayal', 'Ralph', 'de', 'Bricassart', 'tormented', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'conflicting', 'loves', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'provide', 'heart', 'soul', 'entire', 'series', 'Father', 'Ralph', 'character', 'multiple', 'contradictions', 'Mr.', 'Chamberlain', 'masterfully', 'complexities', 'screen', 'first', 'tender', 'scenes', 'young', 'Meggie', 'sensational', 'Sydney', 'Penney', 'final', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'adult', 'Meggie', 'rose', 'garden', '40', 'years', 'later', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'mesmerizing', 'unforgettable', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Peter', 'Strauss', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'were', 'noteworthy', 'names', 'who', 'were', 'one', 'time', 'considered', 'part', 'Father', 'Ralph', 'thankfully', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'wife', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'suggested', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'portrayal', 'Ralph', 'de', 'Bricassart', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'best', 'loved', 'characterizations', 'television', 'history.The', 'series', 'won', 'numerous', 'awards', 'including', 'Emmy', 'best', 'film', 'editing', 'superior', 'work', 'done', 'editors', 'evident', 'entire', '10', 'hours', 'two', 'terrific', 'scenes', 'deserve', 'mention', 'first', 'when', 'transfixed', 'Father', 'Ralph', 'breathtaking', 'Meggie', 'descending', 'stairs', 'Ashes', 'Roses', 'gown', 'second', 'montage', 'film', 'Meggie', 'wedding', 'Luke', 'Australia', 'intertwined', 'Ralph', 'ordination', 'Rome', 'Bishop', 'scenes', 'are', 'superb', 'examples', 'how', 'expert', 'editing', 'immeasurably', 'overall', 'quality', 'final', 'production', 'musical', 'score', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'ludicrous', 'was', 'not', 'awarded', 'Emmy', 'brilliant', 'theme', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'emotional', 'story', 'only', 'negative', 'epic', 'saga', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'do', 'extremely', 'ungracious', 'comments', 'author', 'novel', 'Colleen', 'McCullough', 'regarding', 'highly', 'respected', 'acclaimed', 'production', 'realize', 'not', 'only', 'writer', 'be', 'dissatisfied', 'final', 'rendition', 'work', 'screen', 'simple', 'comment', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'infinitely', 'more', 'classy', 'Instead', 'miniseries', 'instant', 'vomit', 'say', 'none', 'exemplary', 'cast', 'could', 'even', 'act', 'would', 'remind', 'Ms.', 'McCullough', 'many', 'actors', 'actresses', 'television', 'production', 'were', 'recognized', 'work', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Emmys', 'gold', 'standard', 'craft', 'Saying', 'likes', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'saying', 'Colleen', 'McCullough', 'can', 'not', 'write', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'statement', 'very', 'mean', 'spirited', 'would', 'also', 'add', '110', 'million', 'viewers', 'beloved', 'miniseries', 'adamantly', 'disagree']",N/A

298273,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,6302150620,Roger J. Buffington,"[13, 16]","The Thorn Birds is truly one of the epic miniseries, ranking at the top with Shogun (which also starred Richard Chamberlain, who reigns as the King of the Miniseries).  The story closely follows the story set forth in Colleen McCullough's bestselling novel, and is a very faithful rendition of the novel.This is a great and epic story set in Australia, from about 1925 through the 1960s and is the story of one Australian family, the Clearys, living in the outback in New South Wales.  Richard Chamberlain stars as Father (later Cardinal) Ralph de Bricassart, a Catholic priest who initially has been ""exhiled"" from Rome to Australia for disagreeing with a Bishop about Church doctrine.  This is really the story of a forbidden and impossible love between Father Ralph and Meghann Cleary (Rachael Ward, who presents a great performance) the young daughter of the Cleary clan.  Father Ralph refuses to allow this love, which is the great love of his life, to stand in the way of his advancement in the Church heirarchy, which is the consuming goal of his life, and which, of course, is utterly incompatible with his love for Meghann.  This is a great story of forbidden love, ambition and betrayal.  Incidentally, Christopher Plummer puts in a very fine performance as Archbishop Vittorio Conini-Verchese, who is a power within the Catholic Church who mentors Father Ralph.  The chemistry between these two is excellent, and was one of my favorite parts of the film.Barbara Stanwyck turns in a wonderful performance as the evil Mary Carson, who is the first to detect the love between Ralph and Meghann, and who diabolically (and succesfully) schemes to frustrate it by arranging for Father Ralph to essentially betray the Clearys to further his own ambition. Richard Kiley (Paddy Cleary), Jean Simmons, Ken Howard, Bryan Brown, and the rest of the supporting cast all turn in very fine performances and more to the point, really seem to understand and reproduce the characters from the novel.  Bryan Brown, in particular, absolutely becomes Luke O'Neill, one of the more important characters in the story, and the chemistry between him and Rachel Ward is superb, for perhaps the very good reason that they later became married in real life.This is a complicated story that nevertheless hangs together very well, and succeeds in its goal: to entertain.  Unlike some miniseries, this one has few if any draggy interludes or long pointless segments that is the downfall of some attempts at miniseries.  The plot moves along nicely from beginning to end, and pretty much every segment of the plot contributes towards the ultimate culmination of the story.  More would be telling.This is one of those films to which the musical score makes a major contribution.

The characters, places, and events unfold just as they did within the pages, missing practically nothing and retaining all of the passion of the original story. As a reader, I confess I still get greater joy out of reading Colleen McCullough's sweeping passages of life in New Zealand and Australia, and within the Vatican elite.
