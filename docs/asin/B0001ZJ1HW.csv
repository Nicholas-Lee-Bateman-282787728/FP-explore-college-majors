818470,AX7WZPQOY27IE,B0001ZJ1HW,Bookandfilmnut,"[1, 3]","My personal opinion, as a MASH fan for nearly 30 years now, is that the series peaked in the 5th and 6th seasons.  Seasons 3, 4 and 7 were nearly as good, but the best year was 5 closely followed by 6.In this season, Charles repleced Frank, which was a refreshing change, as the Burns character had gotten so childish as to be unbelievable, and there was not much more to do with the character, especially after his romance with Margaret ended.The other main characters still retained alot of their initial personalities, and the sometimes sanctimonious preaching that plagues the final few seasons was not yet evident.In season 6, you can see that the basic formula that the shows would follow had been solidified.  In the first couple of seasons, MASH, like all sit-com before it, simply followed one story per episode, moving straight through the storyline.  By season 3, they started experimenting with multiple storylines in each episode, streamlining the formula through seasons 4 and 5.  For a while they even experimented with 3 plotlines in an episode, but eventually they settled on a 2 plot formula, with about half of the episode dedicated to each plot -opne of them played for laughs, the other for drama.  This was something of a pioneering experiment, but many later sitcoms used the same kind of 2-plot per episode idea (partuclarly Friends, but many others since MASH have done this).  In this season, #6, the formula is basically set, and it works quite well.  later on it became a little tired, and sometimes forced, but at this point it really helped the show.My favorite episodes in this season would be the 2 part premiere, the episode called Winchester Tapes, where Charles dictates a letter home on a tape recorder, and the episode with Charles and his French horn and BJ and Hawkeye's bath strike.",5,The second best year,1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,1822,"['personal', 'opinion', 'MASH', 'fan', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'now', 'series', 'peaked', '5th', '6th', 'seasons', 'Seasons', '3', '4', '7', 'were', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'best', 'year', 'was', '5', 'closely', 'followed', '6.In', 'season', 'Charles', 'repleced', 'Frank', 'was', 'refreshing', 'change', 'Burns', 'character', 'had', 'gotten', 'so', 'childish', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'character', 'especially', 'romance', 'Margaret', 'ended.The', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'still', 'retained', 'alot', 'initial', 'personalities', 'sometimes', 'sanctimonious', 'preaching', 'final', 'few', 'seasons', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'evident.In', 'season', '6', 'can', 'see', 'basic', 'formula', 'shows', 'would', 'follow', 'had', 'been', 'solidified', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'MASH', 'sit-com', 'simply', 'followed', 'one', 'story', 'episode', 'moving', 'straight', 'storyline', 'season', '3', 'started', 'experimenting', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'episode', 'streamlining', 'formula', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'while', 'even', 'experimented', '3', 'plotlines', 'episode', 'eventually', 'settled', '2', 'plot', 'formula', 'half', 'episode', 'dedicated', 'plot', '-opne', 'played', 'laughs', 'other', 'drama', 'was', 'something', 'pioneering', 'experiment', 'many', 'later', 'sitcoms', 'used', 'same', 'kind', '2-plot', 'episode', 'idea', 'partuclarly', 'Friends', 'many', 'others', 'MASH', 'have', 'done', 'season', '6', 'formula', 'basically', 'set', 'quite', 'well', 'later', 'became', 'little', 'tired', 'sometimes', 'forced', 'point', 'really', 'helped', 'show.My', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'would', 'be', '2', 'part', 'premiere', 'episode', 'called', 'Winchester', 'Tapes', 'where', 'Charles', 'letter', 'home', 'tape', 'recorder', 'episode', 'Charles', 'French', 'horn', 'BJ', 'Hawkeye', 'bath', 'strike']",M*A*S*H: Season Six

Winchester was a delight skillfully played(with fake blue-blood accent) by David Ogden Stiers. Season 6(really beginning with season 5) and on are often belted with reviews about how preachy, and sentimental the episodes became which is true. It was, probably, a fresh approach by the producers and writers to be different and contrast the often irreverant nature of the show when Col. Blake was at the helm. One of the episodes that demonstrates this is ""Fallen Idol"". This episode showed other sides to the character of Pierce as well as Radar.

818472,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0001ZJ1HW,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 2]","Based on a Richard Hooker novel of the same name, MASH was released in 1970 as a full-length feature film by 20th Century Fox before experiencing widespread success as a groundbreaking television sitcom in the Fall of 1972. The show's brilliant integration of drama and comedy made it one of the most celebrated shows in TV history, culminating in an eleven year prime time series stint. The 1983 series finale of MASH made history as the program with the single largest audience in television history, beating out several SuperBowls and the fabled ""Who Shot J.R."" episode of Dallas. With the proliferation of new television mediums, it's a record likely to never be broken...The sitcom is set in South Korea during American involvement in the Korea War (with M*A*S*H standing for ""Mobile Army Surgical Hospital""). Buffered from the front lines by a mountain range and a minefield, the men and women of MASH were tasked with patching up wounded American soldiers. Unique to its genre, the cast of MASH was unusually large. Surgeons Dr. Benjamin Pierce (Alan Alda) and Dr. ""Trapper"" John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers) play the roles of excellent doctors who enjoy women and booze, while Dr. Frank Burns (Larry Linville) and Nurse Practitioner Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit) play foil to the two men's shenanigans (due to a contract dispute, Rogers' character was later replaced by Dr. B.J. Hunnicutt - played by Mike Farrell). The character of Frank Burns was also later replaced by Dr. Charles Emerson Winchester (David Ogden Stiers)...Corporal Max Klinger (Jamie Farr) provides comic relief with his early attempts to procure a discharge by dressing in women's clothing, and Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher) adds flavor to a diverse cast of characters. Also rounding out the cast are Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), Corporal Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff), and Col. Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan)...The MASH (Season 6) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Fade Out, Fade In"" in which Frank Burns is arrested while on leave and eventually gets a transfer. His replacement is Major Charles Emerson Winchester III, who quickly makes an impression on Hawkeye and B.J... Other notable episodes from Season 6 include ""In Love and War"" in which a nurse arrives in the camp who may have once had a romance with Hot Lips' husband, and ""The Merchant of Korea"" in which Charles is persuaded to play poker (first winning big, and then, losing it all)...Below is a list of episodes included on the MASH (Season 6) DVD:Episode 121 (Fade Out, Fade In)Episode 122 (Fallen Idol)Episode 123 (Last Laugh)Episode 124 (War of Nerves)Episode 125 (The Winchester Tapes)Episode 126 (The Light That Failed)Episode 127 (In Love and War)Episode 128 (Change Day)Episode 129

The one that persistently bothers me is the fact that during the first 5 seasons, Larry Linville's character was never allowed to grow, or mature. When I contemplate how WELL he handled the character of Frank Burns as a pathetic, sad, jerk; I often wonder what it would have been like if he had been allowed to make Frank 'grow up'.The producers of the show were fortunate indeed when they found David Ogden-Stires to play the role of ""Charles Emerson Winchester, III; he was a fresh and hilarious version of the necessary ""jerk' character, and I am really looking forward to receiving my copy of the 6th season!",5,I LOVE M*A*S*H,1081641600,"04 11, 2004",2004,751,"['was', 'just', '15', 'when', 'M*A*S*H', 'first', 'aired', 'fell', 'instantly', 'love', 'show', 'Even', 'now', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'few', 'faults', 'program', 'one', 'bothers', 'fact', 'first', '5', 'seasons', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'character', 'was', 'never', 'allowed', 'grow', 'mature', 'When', 'contemplate', 'how', 'WELL', 'handled', 'character', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'pathetic', 'sad', 'jerk', 'often', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'make', 'Frank', ""'grow"", ""up'.The"", 'producers', 'show', 'were', 'fortunate', 'indeed', 'when', 'found', 'David', 'Ogden-Stires', 'play', 'role', 'Charles', 'Emerson', 'Winchester', 'III', 'was', 'fresh', 'hilarious', 'version', 'necessary', 'jerk', 'character', 'am', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'receiving', 'copy', '6th', 'season']",M*A*S*H: Season Six

They fall back on from seasons eight and on.Charles Emerson Winchester III breathed new life back into the show. Poor Frank (Larry Linville)had taken that character as far as it could go. He finally went bonkers after chasing Margaret and her new husband around Tokyo and get into some sticky messes. Instead of being discharged on a section 8, he is promoted and sent State Side, much to the dismay of Pierce and BJ. Charles, at first a temporary fill-in for Frank, finds that he has to say permanently.He is  from if from a very influential family in ""Baahston"" and went to ""Haahvad"" and worked at ""Baahston General"".  Fairing too well in a bet with a Colonel at Tokyo General got him transferred permanently to 4077.Some pivotal episodes. ""Fade in Fade Out"" the first episode of the season where they bid farewell to Frank (phone) and say hello to Charles. They find that Charles is not Frank. He briuses a few egos in the OR, where he performs a difficult operations that not even Hawkeye is familiar with. After he is assigned anther operation over Hawkeye decides that he ""Refuses to play second scapel"" to Winchester. They also find that playing a joke on him is not as easy as they planned.""Fallen Idol"" Hawkeye sends Radar to Seoul to get some ""R&R;""  but Radar is shot on the way. Consumed with guilt, he gets drunk and is not fit to operate the next day. When Radar expresses his disappointment, he goes off on Radar and has the whole camp mad at him.In ""War of Nerves"" everyone is getting on everyone's nerves until Sidney shows up and saves the day.Of course there is the famous two parter ""Comrades in Arms"" where Hawkeye and Margaret are trapped together and get to know each other on ""a more personal level"". ""The Smell of Music"" seems to be a favorite to all where Hawkeye and BJ refuse to bathe when Charles gets a new horn and damages their ears with it. ""Temporary Duty"" gets a new guy assigned to the swamp while Pierce is out and Charles and BJ must join sides to get rid of him.The introduction of Charles, unlike the introduction of BJ and Potter seemed to go a little more smoothly. I think most people were tired of Frank at this point. Charles proved a new challeng for Pierce and BJ, an Excellent surgeon and intellectual elite, although he is humanized in a few episodes ""Dr. Winchester & Mr. Hyde"" where he becomes hooked on amphetemines and ""The Light that Failed"" where he nearly kills a patient by accidently giving him the wrong medicine.This season is when the show really peaked, although the first three were classic.

The opening episode Fade In Fade Out is especilly enjoyable as Winchester is exiled from protective Tokyo to the 4077.  Winchester proves to be a prime time player in the series from this opening episode.  He is much more complex a character than Frank Burns every was(not to say that Frank was not funny).  He has standout performances in The Light That Failed, Dr Winchester and Mr Hyde, and The Smell of Music.  The finish to the later epiode is priceless.Margaret Houlihan evolves quite a bit  throughout the series as her relationship with Donald Penopscott fluctuates from good to bad to good and then bad again.  The Comrade in Arms episode shows a lot of Margaret's vulnerability and she becomes less independent as this season wears on.Klinger continues to amuse, Radar plays his part with conviction and of course Hawkeye is still ever the grandstanding doctor.

818477,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B0001ZJ1HW,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[0, 0]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThe sixth season of ""MASH"" again has to reinvent the wheel because of the departure of Larry Linville, who played Major Frank Burns for the first five years of the show.  To fill the hole in the cast, the show turns to David Ogden Stiers to play Major Charles Emerson Winchester III, an ingenious surgeon but a stuffy personality guaranteed to clash with Hawkeye and B.J.The hour-long season premiere ""Fade Out, Fade In"" has the unenviable task of dreaming up a plausible way to address closure for the Frank Burns character with its portrayer already absent.  Somewhat inevitably, the show uses Margaret Houlihan's newlywed status to drive her ex-lover Frank Burns over the edge.  A series of comically bizarre incidents filter back to the camp in anecdotal form, and gradually convince Col. Potter that Major Burns isn't fit for the unit anymore.  This is certainly understandable and realistic, but also regrettable because Frank Burns seems almost sweet and redeemed with his reaction to Margaret's wedding at the end of the fifth season.  Additionally, the story does a very nice job of integrating an entirely new character into a long-running series.  Far from the realities of the war, Stiers' Winchester is playing cribbage in Tokyo with his commanding officer when a frustrated call goes out for a replacement at the 4077th...Other shows this season expertly elicit interest in the newcomer.  One of my particular favorites is ""The Winchester Tapes,"" where Charles records a steamed letter home to his parents in Massachusetts.  Episodes also address the strains on Margaret's new married relationship with Donald Penobscott.  The best of these is the two-part ""Comrades In Arms,"" featuring some of the best work of both Alan Alda and Loretta Swit.A very subpar season finale called ""Major Topper"" is a significant demerit on quality, but the creative strength this season demonstrates overall makes it another set of classic episodes.",5,"""MASH"" keeps getting better as Winchester debuts in Season Six",1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,1960,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWThe', 'sixth', 'season', 'MASH', 'again', 'reinvent', 'wheel', 'departure', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'who', 'played', 'Major', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'first', 'five', 'years', 'show', 'fill', 'hole', 'cast', 'show', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'play', 'Major', 'Charles', 'Emerson', 'Winchester', 'III', 'ingenious', 'surgeon', 'stuffy', 'personality', 'guaranteed', 'clash', 'Hawkeye', 'B.J.The', 'hour-long', 'season', 'Fade', 'Out', 'Fade', 'unenviable', 'task', 'dreaming', 'up', 'plausible', 'way', 'address', 'closure', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'character', 'portrayer', 'already', 'absent', 'Somewhat', 'inevitably', 'show', 'Margaret', 'Houlihan', 'newlywed', 'status', 'drive', 'ex-lover', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'edge', 'series', 'comically', 'bizarre', 'incidents', 'filter', 'back', 'camp', 'anecdotal', 'form', 'gradually', 'convince', 'Col.', 'Potter', 'Major', 'Burns', ""n't"", 'fit', 'unit', 'anymore', 'certainly', 'understandable', 'realistic', 'also', 'regrettable', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'almost', 'sweet', 'redeemed', 'reaction', 'Margaret', 'wedding', 'end', 'fifth', 'season', 'Additionally', 'story', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'integrating', 'entirely', 'new', 'character', 'long-running', 'series', 'Far', 'realities', 'war', 'Stiers', 'Winchester', 'playing', 'cribbage', 'Tokyo', 'commanding', 'officer', 'when', 'frustrated', 'call', 'out', 'replacement', '4077th', 'Other', 'shows', 'season', 'expertly', 'elicit', 'interest', 'newcomer', 'One', 'particular', 'favorites', 'Winchester', 'Tapes', 'where', 'Charles', 'steamed', 'letter', 'home', 'parents', 'Massachusetts', 'Episodes', 'also', 'address', 'strains', 'Margaret', 'new', 'married', 'relationship', 'Donald', 'Penobscott', 'best', 'two-part', 'Comrades', 'Arms', 'featuring', 'best', 'work', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Loretta', 'Swit.A', 'very', 'subpar', 'season', 'finale', 'called', 'Major', 'Topper', 'significant', 'demerit', 'quality', 'creative', 'strength', 'season', 'overall', 'set', 'classic', 'episodes']",M*A*S*H: Season Six
818478,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B0001ZJ1HW,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[3, 6]","This was Charles Emerson Winchester's first season (wonderfully played by David Odgen Stiers, a great character actor who is still doing wonderful work today).  He replaced Frank Burns, who was quickly becoming a caricature in the 4th and 5th seasons.  I ended up liking Charles much more than I probably should have.  The audience was supposed to dislike him because he was a snob, an egomaniac, and a blue blood who stuck his nose up at the rest of the camp.  Yet, he was a brilliant surgeon who knew about great wine, food, and art.  In these later episodes, BJ and Hawkeye grew increasingly PC, preachy, and sanctimonious.  Charles used to rib them endlessly, but I ended up liking his upper class, blue blood insults on Hawk and BJ, because I disliked Hawkeye and BJ so much.  Charles was not as gung ho as Burns, as was much more human as the war (and seasons) progressed.  He really was the only character who seemed to grow as the series went on.  Hawkeye and BJ continued in the same preachy vein, and none of the other characters really ever grew out of their initial portrayals, so Charles was definitely the best part of the later MASH seasons.",3,The addition of Charles was the best thing that happened to the later MASH seasons,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,1156,"['was', 'Charles', 'Emerson', 'Winchester', 'first', 'season', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'David', 'Odgen', 'Stiers', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'still', 'doing', 'wonderful', 'work', 'today', 'replaced', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'who', 'was', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'caricature', '4th', '5th', 'seasons', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'Charles', 'much', 'more', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'audience', 'was', 'supposed', 'dislike', 'was', 'snob', 'egomaniac', 'blue', 'blood', 'who', 'stuck', 'nose', 'up', 'rest', 'camp', 'was', 'brilliant', 'surgeon', 'who', 'knew', 'about', 'great', 'wine', 'food', 'art', 'later', 'episodes', 'BJ', 'Hawkeye', 'grew', 'increasingly', 'PC', 'preachy', 'sanctimonious', 'Charles', 'used', 'rib', 'endlessly', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'upper', 'class', 'blue', 'blood', 'insults', 'Hawk', 'BJ', 'disliked', 'Hawkeye', 'BJ', 'so', 'much', 'Charles', 'was', 'not', 'gung', 'ho', 'Burns', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'war', 'seasons', 'progressed', 'really', 'was', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'seemed', 'grow', 'series', 'went', 'Hawkeye', 'BJ', 'continued', 'same', 'preachy', 'vein', 'none', 'other', 'characters', 'really', 'ever', 'grew', 'initial', 'portrayals', 'Charles', 'was', 'definitely', 'best', 'part', 'later', 'MASH', 'seasons']",M*A*S*H: Season Six

Season 6 brought the final ""new"" cast member to the show -- Winchester.  And it breathed new life into the series in it's 6th year.

Sure, eventually the stories got a bit too serious and hokie, but for now, they still kept a fine balance between the serious and the silly.  this season finds an almost pitch perfect balance.Early seasons had more characters and lots of silliness, but as time went on, they whittled things down to a more managable size.  This season shows that at it's finest.And of course we get Sid Freedman back this year, as well as the infamous Hawkeye and Hotlips romantic encounter.

818485,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0001ZJ1HW,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[18, 20]","The success of the 1970 film ""MASH"" (directed by Robert Altman) inspired the production of one of the most successful and longest running TV series of all time: ""M*A*S*H"".  While most of the main characters from the original film were portrayed in the TV series, only one of the film's actors reprised his role for the TV series: Gary Burghoff.  Like the film, the show was about the men and women working in a fictitious U.S. Army ""Mobile Army Surgical Hospital"" (or MASH unit) known as the 4077th during the Korean War in the early 1950's.Having been on the air for so many years, it was not surprising that some of the original characters/cast members were no longer part of the show.  This included Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson, 1929-1996) and Capt. ""Trapper John"" McIntyre (Wayne Rogers) following the show's third season, and Major Frank Burns as played by Larry Linville (1939-2000) at the end of the show's fifth season.  Hence, coming into its sixth season, the original characters/cast members still part of ""M*A*S*H"" included Maj. Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit), Capt. Benjamin Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce (Alan Alda), Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher), Cpl. Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff) and Cpl. Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr).  Col. Sherman T. Potter (Harry Morgan) had replaced Lt. Col. Henry Blake and Capt. B.J. Hunnicut (Mike Farrell) replaced Trapper at the beginning of the show's fourth season and to begin the show's sixth season, yet another new face would emerge as a principle character: Major Charles Emerson Winchester, III (David Ogden Stiers).Whereas Major Burns was a completely hypocritical and a poor surgeon, Maj. Winchester was a much better surgeon, had a wealthy family, but was not married and developed no adulterous affair with Maj. Houlihan. Thus, the departure of Maj. Burns changed the flavor of the show considerably as Hawkeye & B.J. could no longer tease him, but they did enjoy playing a number of practical jokes of Maj. Winchester.  What I give David Ogden Stiers much credit for is the ability to come into a very popular TV show that had already been on the air for five years and blend in beautifully with the other cast members and make his portrayal of Maj. Winchester flow smoothly, comically and emotionally.Though the cast had changed, as in the original 1970 film and the first five seasons of the TV series, ""M*A*S*H"" continued to demonstrate a total lack of respect for the U.S. military by portraying many of its officers as being inept and incompetent.  However, with the departure of Maj. Burns, Maj. Houlihan, who got married at the end of the fifth season, was more focused on her husband stationed in Tokyo.  B.J. continued to be Hawkeye's best friend and as they had disliked the departed Maj. Burns, Maj. Winchester and his pompous attitude gave them many reasons to dislike him.  Col. Potter was not particularly fond of Maj. Winchester either, but appreciated his medical skills (far more than Frank's).  The special bond that had developed between Col. Potter and the 4077th's lowly company clerk, Radar, continued and, as always, it was essentially Radar's responsibility to help keep things running smoothly.  Father Mulcahy was always polite and helpful while Cpl. Klinger continued to wear women's clothes in an attempt to get a ""Section 8"", which would give him a discharge from the Army.The sixth season of ""M*A*S*H"" that aired between 1977 and 1978 featured the following 24 episodes:1. ""Fade Out, Fade In"". After Maj. Houlihan's honeymoon, Col. Potter sends Frank on some much needed R&R; but the distraught Frank gets himself into trouble and when his return to the 4077th is delayed, Col. Potter receives word that not only has Frank received orders to return to the states, he's been promoted to Lt. Col! In the meantime, Radar manages to get a temporary replacement for Frank: Maj. Winchester, but to his chagrin, his temporary assignment to the 4077th quickly becomes permanent once it's obvious that Frank is never returning.2. ""Fallen Idol"". Radar's high opinion of Hawkeye is tested when Radar is accidentally wounded and has to have surgery, but Hawkeye is so upset and hung-over that Maj. Winchester has to take over for Hawkeye.  This leads to some rough words from Hawkeye to Radar, but the two make up in the end.3. ""Last Laugh"".  A friend of B.J.'s visits, Leo Bardonaro (James Cromwell), who loves to play practical jokes just as much as B.J. & Hawkeye.4. ""War of Nerves"".  When everyone's nerves at the 4077th are heating up, some of the troops start to build a giant bonfire, which Col. Potter isn't sure is a good idea until Sidney Friedman (Alan Arbus) visits.5. ""The Winchester Tapes"".  Hawkeye & B.J. battle Maj. Winchester while he's recording messages to his family begging them to help him get out of Korea.6. ""The Light That Failed"".  When supply trucks run low, everyone gets hooked on a mystery novel that B.J. receives, but the book is missing the final critical page.7. ""In Love and War"". Hawkeye falls in love with a Korean woman named Kyung Soon (Kieu-Chinh), but the war forces her to take her family south.8. ""Change Day"". Winchester comes up with a scheme to make money when the Army switches monetary scripts, but his plan backfires.9. ""Images"". Radar wants to get a tattoo while Margaret deals with a nurse who can't stand severe injuries.10. ""The M*A*S*H Olympics"". With the talk of the Olympics on the radio and everyone at the 4077th getting out of shape, Col. Potter decides to hold a 4077th Olympics and Margaret's visiting husband, Lt. Colonel Donald Penobscott (Beeson Carroll), becomes her team's superstar.11. ""The Grim Reaper"".  Hawkeye loses his temper when a visiting colonel discusses casualty predictions as just numbers. This leads to a possible court martial for Hawkeye, but the charges get dropped.12. ""Comrades in Arms (Part 1)"". While on a mission, Hawkeye & Margaret come under fire and seek refuge in an abandoned hut.  They quickly wrap their arms around each other and kiss during the heat of battle.13. ""Comrades in Arms (Part 2)"". Upon the return of Hawkeye & Margaret to the 4077th, the romance that seemed to have started under fire quickly ends.14. ""The Merchant of Korea"". No one can figure out why Charles is so good at playing poker until Radar figures him out.15. ""The Smell of Music"". To protest Charles poorly playing a French horn, Hawkeye & B.J. stop bathing.  Things come to a head while Col. Potter tries to stop a wounded soldier from committing suicide.16. ""Patient 4077"".  When the Army Corp. of Engineers won't help Hawkeye & B.J. design a new surgical clamp, they turn to a Korean metal worker.17. ""Tea and Empathy"".  With the 4077th running low on penicillin, Father Mulcahy goes with Klinger to retrieve a hidden stash.18. ""Your Hit Parade"". With a record number of wounded coming through the 4077th, Col. Potter asks Radar to act as a disk jockey to keep up spirits.19. ""What's Up, Doc?"". When Margaret thinks she's pregnant, she gets Radar to let Hawkeye use his pet rabbit to test with on condition that Hawkeye not kill the pet rabbit.  In the meantime, an upset patient holds Charles and B.J. at gunpoint.20. ""Mail Call Three"". Five heavy sacks of mail arrive after a delay of three weeks.  Some is good news, some bad.21. ""Temporary Duty"". A temporary transfer of personnel swap between the 4077th & the 8063rd leaves Charles missing Hawkeye thanks to his replacement: Captain Roy Dupree (George Lindsey).22. ""Potter's Retirement"". A disgruntled soldier tries to get Col. Potter replaced.23. ""Dr. Winchester and Mr. Hyde"". Winchester becomes a superman for a while after he gets hooked on amphetamines.24. ""Major Topper"". A lack of morphine encourages Col. Potter to try giving the patients placebos in spite of Col. Winchester's misgivings.  In the meantime, an enlisted soldier on guard with Klinger goes berserk and Col. Potter giveshim a Section 8.Overall, I rate the sixth season of ""M*A*S*H"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  In its eleven years of production, ""M*A*S*H"" was one of the best TV shows of its day and remains one of the best TV shows of all time.",5,David Ogden Stiers' First Season as Major

818486,A2VPEDJQCOQM9D,B0001ZJ1HW,"Mr. Dana ""Dana_Franklin""","[6, 7]","In a refreshing change from Maj. Burns, we welcome David Ogden Stiers as Major Charles Emerson Winchester, III, Hawkeye's and BJ equal in every sense, as long as it's Medical!!A thoroughly enjoyable season contined M*A*S*H's tradition of brilliantly mixed drams with comedy and vice versa.  We also got a lot of depth on all the other characters as well.Other than M*A*S*H, there's only one other show I can watch repeatedly, and still laugh outloud and that's Frasier.For the episodes themselves, M*A*S*H has never been better, more convenient, and funnier (thanks to long edited scenes rarely seen in syndicated TV)! It's almost like seeing it for the first time. I was surprised to notice that many episodes had close to five (5) minutes edited out in Syndication.One allure of DVD's, in addition to the Sound and Picture Quality, are the ""Extras"". Other than the ability to take out the laugh tracks (Yes!), this has none. There are no cast interviews, no bloopers, no Director's/Producers/Writers Commentary, not even Cast Biographies. Even the insert is rather plan and has nothing extra to it. The episode description look as though they were written by some one who hadn't even watched the show. I was hoping for more when the DVD's came out. Like the book ""Complete Book of M*A*S*H"" was not complete in it's fullest sense by leaving out that which would have made it truly complete (the secondary story lines, etc.), this is not complete in the DVD's fullest sense...the extras we've all come to expect in them. In that respect I am disappointed. But I am not disappointed in having a whole season on only 3 DVD's! I am not disappointed in the quality of the sound and picture (much better than the Video's from Columbia House and the Broadcast versions).My only other complaint is with their painfully slow release schedule of only two seasons per year. At this rate, it's going to be the end of 2006 before the whole series is available.A great season you surely don't want to miss.Now, on to Season 7!",5,"Welcome to the 4077th Charles Emerson Winchester, III",1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,2013,"['refreshing', 'change', 'Maj.', 'Burns', 'welcome', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'Major', 'Charles', 'Emerson', 'Winchester', 'III', 'Hawkeye', 'BJ', 'equal', 'sense', 'as', 'long', 'Medical', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'season', 'contined', 'M*A*S*H', 'tradition', 'brilliantly', 'mixed', 'drams', 'comedy', 'vice', 'versa', 'also', 'got', 'lot', 'depth', 'other', 'characters', 'well.Other', 'M*A*S*H', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'still', 'laugh', 'outloud', 'Frasier.For', 'episodes', 'M*A*S*H', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'convenient', 'funnier', 'thanks', 'long', 'edited', 'scenes', 'rarely', 'seen', 'syndicated', 'TV', 'almost', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'surprised', 'notice', 'many', 'episodes', 'had', 'close', 'five', '5', 'minutes', 'edited', 'out', 'Syndication.One', 'allure', 'DVD', 'addition', 'Sound', 'Picture', 'Quality', 'are', 'Extras', 'Other', 'ability', 'take', 'out', 'laugh', 'tracks', 'Yes', 'none', 'are', 'cast', 'interviews', 'bloopers', ""Director's/Producers/Writers"", 'Commentary', 'not', 'even', 'Cast', 'Biographies', 'Even', 'insert', 'rather', 'plan', 'nothing', 'extra', 'episode', 'description', 'look', 'were', 'written', 'one', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'watched', 'show', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'when', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'book', 'Complete', 'Book', 'M*A*S*H', 'was', 'not', 'complete', 'fullest', 'sense', 'leaving', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'truly', 'complete', 'secondary', 'story', 'lines', 'etc', 'not', 'complete', 'DVD', 'fullest', 'sense', 'extras', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'respect', 'am', 'disappointed', 'am', 'not', 'disappointed', 'having', 'whole', 'season', 'only', '3', 'DVD', 'am', 'not', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'sound', 'picture', 'much', 'better', 'Video', 'Columbia', 'House', 'Broadcast', 'versions', '.My', 'only', 'other', 'complaint', 'painfully', 'slow', 'release', 'schedule', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'year', 'rate', 'going', 'be', 'end', '2006', 'whole', 'series', 'available.A', 'great', 'season', 'surely', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss.Now', 'Season', '7']",M*A*S*H: Season Six
818487,A3106VD94ULBKZ,B0001ZJ1HW,"Nathan Bauer ""Movie Man""","[1, 8]",Well I have seen it all and this season of MASH has been very good because 20th Century finally did something smart for these DVDs for seasons 5 and 6 that is put in a PLAY ALL button on the menu of the first screen after the 20th Century Fox logo scrolls up.  I have enjoyed all 6 seasons of MASH and just getting started people have said it gets a little boring after season 7 because the famous character Radar goes away for good well your dead wrong Jamie Farr who plays Klinger the Corporal who wears dresses just to get out of the Army has decided to start getting rid of the dodge.  Season 6 we see alot of people come and go for instance we see the enviable Frank Burns played by Larry Linville leave the beloved 4077th for the states after he gets discharged with a Section Eight because he becomes crazy.  The actual character who played Frank Burns Linville became home sick and decided to have the Execs write Burns out of the script so he can go home to his real life.  Enter Charles Emerson Winchester the 3rd played by David Ogden Stires who enters the season in an episode called Fade In Fade Out he is playing a British surgeon who is stationed in Japan for a couple of weeks and gets called up to the MASH 4077 to work in the OR for a two day stint and ends up being permanent because of Frank Burns leaving for home.  I have seasons 1-6 on DVD and I have to say without a doubt this is the greatest of them all a sad season and somewhat happy season.  But as you all know Radar played by Gary Burgoff leaves after the next season 7 and he leaves in a one hour episode entitled Good Bye Radar in a two part episode they write him out as he is gone on leave because he needed it and Klinger fills in when he gets back Radar's mom is on the phone and his uncle who helps his mom run the farm dies and is needed at home and they send him home on a Hardship Discharge and he leaves amongest the maddness that occurs at the 40 double 7 because the generator that supplies the light in the operating room becomes dead and they need to get it going again but Klinger doesn't amass the expertise it takes to cut thru the red tape in order to get the generator and it takes him a while to get that we see Radar leave behind his beloved teddy that we see him go to bed with every night in each of the episodes.  In the very last season we see BJ played by Mike Farrell bury the teddy in a time capsule telling everyone it is for all those who have come to this war a kid and gone home a man and that is what Radar does he leaves the 40 double 7 a kid but goes home a man.  The episode is in season 11 entitle As Time Goes By and that shows also a famous fly baidt made by Henry Blake that is said for all of those soliders that never made it home that Henry died in episode 72 of Season 3 in an episode entitled Abyssinia Henry.  Hopefully we will see 20th Century make a 4 Disc Special Edition marking the end of MASH season 11 with the finally episode of the series entitled Goodbye Good Luck and Amen on a seperate disk from the others with special feature maybe the 30th Anniversary of The Television series MASH and the making of the show itself with interviews with all the cast and crew who make the show possible and who made children who were born in the time of MASH now about the real people.  But overall the season of MASH was awesome.,5,Great Season,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,3356,"['Well', 'have', 'seen', 'season', 'MASH', 'been', 'very', 'good', '20th', 'Century', 'finally', 'did', 'something', 'smart', 'DVDs', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'put', 'PLAY', 'ALL', 'button', 'menu', 'first', 'screen', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'logo', 'up', 'have', 'enjoyed', '6', 'seasons', 'MASH', 'just', 'getting', 'started', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'little', 'boring', 'season', '7', 'famous', 'character', 'Radar', 'away', 'good', 'well', 'dead', 'wrong', 'Jamie', 'Farr', 'who', 'Klinger', 'Corporal', 'who', 'just', 'get', 'Army', 'decided', 'start', 'getting', 'rid', 'dodge', 'Season', '6', 'see', 'alot', 'people', 'come', 'go', 'instance', 'see', 'enviable', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'played', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'leave', 'beloved', '4077th', 'states', 'discharged', 'Section', 'Eight', 'crazy', 'actual', 'character', 'who', 'played', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'Linville', 'became', 'home', 'sick', 'decided', 'have', 'Execs', 'write', 'Burns', 'script', 'can', 'go', 'home', 'real', 'life', 'Enter', 'Charles', 'Emerson', 'Winchester', '3rd', 'played', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stires', 'who', 'season', 'episode', 'called', 'Fade', 'Fade', 'Out', 'playing', 'British', 'surgeon', 'who', 'stationed', 'Japan', 'couple', 'weeks', 'called', 'up', 'MASH', '4077', 'work', 'OR', 'two', 'day', 'stint', 'up', 'being', 'permanent', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'leaving', 'home', 'have', 'seasons', '1-6', 'DVD', 'have', 'say', 'doubt', 'greatest', 'sad', 'season', 'somewhat', 'happy', 'season', 'know', 'Radar', 'played', 'Gary', 'Burgoff', 'next', 'season', '7', 'one', 'hour', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Good', 'Bye', 'Radar', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'write', 'out', 'gone', 'leave', 'needed', 'Klinger', 'fills', 'when', 'back', 'Radar', 'mom', 'phone', 'uncle', 'who', 'mom', 'run', 'farm', 'dies', 'needed', 'home', 'send', 'home', 'Hardship', 'Discharge', 'maddness', '40', 'double', '7', 'generator', 'light', 'operating', 'room', 'dead', 'need', 'get', 'going', 'again', 'Klinger', ""n't"", 'amass', 'expertise', 'cut', 'thru', 'red', 'tape', 'order', 'get', 'generator', 'while', 'get', 'see', 'Radar', 'leave', 'beloved', 'teddy', 'see', 'go', 'bed', 'night', 'episodes', 'very', 'last', 'season', 'see', 'BJ', 'played', 'Mike', 'Farrell', 'teddy', 'time', 'capsule', 'telling', 'everyone', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'war', 'kid', 'gone', 'home', 'man', 'what', 'Radar', '40', 'double', '7', 'kid', 'home', 'man', 'episode', 'season', '11', 'entitle', 'Time', 'Goes', 'also', 'famous', 'fly', 'baidt', 'made', 'Henry', 'Blake', 'said', 'soliders', 'never', 'made', 'home', 'Henry', 'died', 'episode', '72', 'Season', '3', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Abyssinia', 'Henry', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'see', '20th', 'Century', 'make', '4', 'Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'marking', 'end', 'MASH', 'season', '11', 'finally', 'episode', 'series', 'entitled', 'Goodbye', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Amen', 'seperate', 'disk', 'others', 'special', 'feature', 'maybe', '30th', 'Anniversary', 'Television', 'series', 'MASH', 'making', 'show', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'who', 'make', 'show', 'possible', 'who', 'made', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'born', 'time', 'MASH', 'now', 'real', 'people', 'season', 'MASH', 'was', 'awesome']",M*A*S*H: Season Six

818490,A3QGRSZ7VTV0SY,B0001ZJ1HW,Rabbi Yonassan Gershom,"[25, 27]","In the opening episode, ""Fade Out, Fade In,"" we learn that Frank Burnes has gone totally bonkers and won't be coming back to the 4077th.  He is replaced by Charles Emerson Winchester III (played by David Ogden Stiers), an intellectual Bostonian snob.  Like Frank, Charles is also a class-A jerk, but he's a jerk with more sophistication.  For example, in ""The Smell of Music"" (one of my all-time favorites), he insists on playing his French horn [badly], to the annoyance of Hawkeye and BJ, who, in turn, refuse to bathe until the music stops.  A feud ensues.  Charles doesn't rant and rave like Frank -- he just calmly goes on playing through it all.  The wit here is more subtle than in previous seasons, but still hilarious.Frank was basically a schoolyard bully, and he never outgrew that role.  When he left the 4077th he was pretty much the same jerk he had been when he arrived.  Charles, on the other hand, will grow and mature as the series progresses.  He learns in ""The Light that Failed"" that he is capable of making mistakes like anybody else.  In ""Dr. Winchester and Mr. Hyde"" his self-abuse of amphetamines to keep up with the hectic pace (and his facade of perfection?) has disastrous results.  By the end of the season, he comes down off his high horse a bit and joins the team -- but never loses his upper-crust dignity.Other characters also begin to grow in new directions during this season.  Margaret becomes more humanized, and is no longer merely a foil for sexist jokes.  Much of this was due to Alan Alda having his own consciousness raised on feminist issues.  This season aired in 1977-78, remember, and the times they were a'changing.  Frankly speaking (pun intended), much of the crude humor in the early seasons was based on jokes that would now be considered sexual harrassment.  After ""Comrades in Arms"" in this season, Margaret and Hawkeye reach a truce of sorts, and treat each other with more respect.While some fans deplore the sixth-season switch from heavy comedy to more serious drama, I applaud it wholeheartedly.  Had the show continued with its original form of verbal slapstick, it would probably have gone off the air long before it did.  As the actors and audience matured over the years, so did the show -- and that was its strength.  I love this season, and look forward to the rest.",5,"Out with Frank, in with Charles",1086912000,"06 11, 2004",2004,2330,"['opening', 'episode', 'Fade', 'Out', 'Fade', 'learn', 'Frank', 'Burnes', 'gone', 'totally', 'bonkers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'coming', 'back', '4077th', 'replaced', 'Charles', 'Emerson', 'Winchester', 'III', 'played', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'intellectual', 'Bostonian', 'snob', 'Frank', 'Charles', 'also', 'class-A', 'jerk', 'jerk', 'more', 'sophistication', 'example', 'Smell', 'Music', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'playing', 'French', 'horn', '[', 'badly', ']', 'annoyance', 'Hawkeye', 'BJ', 'who', 'turn', 'refuse', 'bathe', 'music', 'feud', 'ensues', 'Charles', ""n't"", 'rant', 'rave', 'Frank', 'just', 'calmly', 'playing', 'wit', 'here', 'more', 'subtle', 'previous', 'seasons', 'still', 'hilarious.Frank', 'was', 'basically', 'schoolyard', 'bully', 'never', 'outgrew', 'role', 'When', 'left', '4077th', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'jerk', 'had', 'been', 'when', 'arrived', 'Charles', 'other', 'hand', 'will', 'grow', 'mature', 'series', 'Light', 'Failed', 'capable', 'making', 'mistakes', 'anybody', 'else', 'Dr.', 'Winchester', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'self-abuse', 'amphetamines', 'keep', 'up', 'hectic', 'pace', 'facade', 'perfection', 'disastrous', 'results', 'end', 'season', 'down', 'high', 'horse', 'bit', 'team', 'never', 'upper-crust', 'dignity.Other', 'characters', 'also', 'begin', 'grow', 'new', 'directions', 'season', 'Margaret', 'more', 'humanized', 'longer', 'merely', 'foil', 'sexist', 'jokes', 'Much', 'was', 'due', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'having', 'own', 'consciousness', 'raised', 'feminist', 'issues', 'season', 'aired', '1977-78', 'remember', 'times', 'were', ""a'changing"", 'Frankly', 'speaking', 'pun', 'intended', 'much', 'crude', 'humor', 'early', 'seasons', 'was', 'based', 'jokes', 'would', 'now', 'be', 'considered', 'sexual', 'harrassment', 'Comrades', 'Arms', 'season', 'Margaret', 'Hawkeye', 'reach', 'truce', 'sorts', 'treat', 'other', 'more', 'respect.While', 'fans', 'deplore', 'sixth-season', 'switch', 'heavy', 'comedy', 'more', 'serious', 'drama', 'applaud', 'wholeheartedly', 'Had', 'show', 'continued', 'original', 'form', 'verbal', 'slapstick', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'gone', 'off', 'air', 'long', 'did', 'actors', 'audience', 'matured', 'years', 'so', 'did', 'show', 'was', 'strength', 'love', 'season', 'look', 'forward', 'rest']",M*A*S*H: Season Six

Back in Season 4 Colonel Blake was replaced by Potter, and Trapper John was replaced by B.J Honeycutt.  Season 6 witnessed the arrival of Charles Emerson Winchester. Like in the other cast changes there were big changes in the characters. This seasons big change was no exception. Charles was everything that Frank wasn't. Charles was a very talented surgeon, Frank wasn't. Charles was able to keep up with B.J and Hawkeye with practical jokes, and sociability. Frank was neither.Fade out Fade In - Frank Burns flips his beanie in Seoul in search of Margaret on Donald on their honeymoon. He acts like he's shampooing a woman's hair and begs to clip her toenails then jumps off a moving bus, nibbles on a womans buttons, and jumps into a hot-tub with a big time general and his wife. Meanwhile Charles Emerson Winchester, a high class Boston surgeon in Tokyo teaching new techniques is playing cribbage with a colonel. He wins $672.17 which gets him sent to the 4077th to fill in for Frank, who's in the middle of his tyrade.Frank's actions get him transfered out of the 4077th. The charges are dropped and Frank is transfered back to Indiana and promoted. Potter seeks a new permanent surgeon. Charles happens to end up stuck in Korea for the duration.Fallen Idol - Radar, acting upon an idea of Hawkeye's, heads to Seoul to ""AHEM"". He gets injured, and is delivered back to the 4077th on a stretcher. Very poinient. We see a major shift in the relationship between Radar and Hawkeye.They both argue for a while until they realize that they are no different. Things might have changed a bit, but they still respect each-other.Last Laugh - A report that B.J is under investigation turns out to be a good friend of B.J pulling off a master practical joke. This leads to a nice series of jokes. A hotel party that gets B.J arrested, an exploding cigar, and electic buzzer handshake, stolen papers, and a jeep with no gas.War Of Nerves - Sydney comes to MASH as a patient, and ends up helping everyone out who are stressed out due to hard work and little sleep. Sydney talks to each of the main members individually. The process of burning uniforms leads to a bon fire which include a ladder. Potter tells Sgt. Zale that if the ladder doesn't come down he'll find a giant hot-foot in his record. Sydney tells Potter that the fire might just be the release that the camp needs to ease the tension that is gripping the camp.Images - Radar wants a tattoo. Margaret has a falling out with one of her nurses.

B.J and Hawkeye set up wagers and the whole camp gets involved.  Race day comes and Charles is really starting to feel the effects of the pills he's been on. He's racing around all night, and is nervous as all get up. Radar's mouse wins the race, at 10 to 1 odds against. The entire camp celebrates, aside from Charles, who crashes from his ride on amphetamines. A few weeks after he finally breaks the habit, he's back to normal, with no major changes.M*A*S*H really started to touch on serious issues with a great sense of humor in the last 6 years of the show.  This year touched upon a soldier with frayed nerves, love, the Olympics, calous Colonels, wartime passions, internation relations, serveral long sessions of O.R., more mail calls, temporary duties, and drug abuse. Mash was so able to do what so many shows these days don't do. I see so many shows that are all about sex and sex and sex. How I yearn for another show like MASH to come along.",5,Say Good-Bye to Boston Charles Emerson Winchester,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,7498,"['M*A*S*H', 'almost', 'other', 'show', 'history',

818494,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B0001ZJ1HW,Simon,"[1, 3]","Season 6 of MASH introduced Major Charles Emerson Winchester III to the 4077th, as a replacement for the AWOL Frank Burns. Winchester has always been my favourite character on the show, as I found his predicament (civilized man trapped in uncivilized society) comparable to my high school years, oddly enough. I think that's always what connected me to MASH, besides the great character interactions and comedic/dramatic stories.Unfortunately, Winchester doesn't really come into his own until late season 7/season 8. At this point in the show he's more of a snobbish version of Frank Burns, with the same snarky impatience for Hawkeye's jokes and some odd sexual tension with Margaret. I wouldn't be the least surprised if some of the early Winchester dialogue and gags were unused material planned for Frank. Still, Winchester's arrival finally cements the show in a new, stronger direction, whereas the previous mix of serious characters like Potter and BJ against the cartoonish Frank sometimes felt oddly jarring.Theres a lot of fun to be had this season. A murder mystery novel that's passed around camp, BJ and Hawkeye's refusal to shower, a huge bonfire where anything goes, and another scare of childish practical jokes. More dramatic episodes include Radar's falling out with Haweye, Hawkeye falling in love with a Korean woman, and also the two-parter where he and Margaret briefly connect. Not surprisingly, Alan Alda had a hand in writing and directing those three episodes, and his work here is still reasonably poignant without becoming the melodrama it would be in later seasons.Another quality season. Still lacking in supplements, but the low price tag balances things out.",5,And the staff keeps on changing,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,1691,"['Season', '6', 'MASH', 'introduced', 'Major', 'Charles', 'Emerson', 'Winchester', 'III', '4077th', 'replacement', 'AWOL', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'Winchester', 'always', 'been', 'favourite', 'character', 'show', 'found', 'predicament', 'civilized', 'man', 'trapped', 'uncivilized', 'society', 'comparable', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'oddly', 'enough', 'think', 'always', 'what', 'connected', 'MASH', 'great', 'character', 'interactions', 'comedic/dramatic', 'stories.Unfortunately', 'Winchester', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'own', 'late', 'season', '7/season', '8', 'point', 'show', 'more', 'snobbish', 'version', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'same', 'snarky', 'impatience', 'Hawkeye', 'jokes', 'odd', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Margaret', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'least', 'surprised', 'early', 'Winchester', 'dialogue', 'gags', 'were', 'unused', 'material', 'planned', 'Frank', 'Still', 'Winchester', 'arrival', 'finally', 'show', 'new', 'stronger', 'direction', 'previous', 'mix', 'serious', 'characters', 'Potter', 'BJ', 'cartoonish', 'Frank', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'oddly', 'lot', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'season', 'murder', 'mystery', 'novel', 'passed', 'camp', 'BJ', 'Hawkeye', 'refusal', 'shower', 'huge', 'bonfire', 'where', 'anything', 'scare', 'childish', 'practical', 'jokes', 'More', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'include', 'Radar', 'falling', 'out', 'Haweye', 'Hawkeye', 'falling', 'love', 'Korean', 'woman', 'also', 'two-parter', 'where', 'Margaret', 'briefly', 'connect', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'had', 'hand', 'writing', 'directing', 'three', 'episodes', 'work', 'here', 'still', 'reasonably', 'poignant', 'becoming', 'melodrama', 'would', 'be', 'later', 'seasons.Another', 'quality', 'season', 'Still', 'lacking', 'supplements', 'low', 'price', 'tag', 'balances', 'things', 'out']",M*A*S*H: Season Six

Season 6 contains some gems, like &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;, &quot;Tea and Empathy&quot;, and &quot;The Light that Failed&quot;.  (Libraries probably STILL get requests for copies of &quot;The Rooster Crowed at Midnight&quot; by Abigail Porterfield from people who think it is a real book.)  But this season it began to stray more and more into the pedantic.  Some episodes, like &quot;MASH Olympics&quot;, were merely boring.  Many viewers liked &quot;Fallen Idol&quot;.  I found the idea excellent, but the execution was much too heavy-handed for my tastes.  And to me &quot;The Smell of Music&quot; (where Hawkeye and BJ refuse to shower until Charles stops playing his French horn) is genuinely distasteful.  It isn't funny.  It makes me cringe.Still, there is enough in this season to make it well worth adding to my collection.  But I believe this is the last season I will buy.  For the rest of its run, MASH became more hit-and-miss, with the misses gradually overtaking the hits.  It became bogged down and self-conscious as the writers (chiefly Alan Alda) decided that every episode needed two plots -- one serious and one funny.  (There is nothing worse than TRYING to be funny.  The great actor Sir Edmund Kean said it on his death bed:  &quot;Dying is easy.  COMEDY is hard.&quot;)  The result was a loss of the spontaneity that made the show at its best truly special.Don't get me wrong.  I'm a huge MASH fan.  I already own the first 6 seasons.  But like many series in the US, as it went on, it got tired.  And we all know that old soldiers never die.
