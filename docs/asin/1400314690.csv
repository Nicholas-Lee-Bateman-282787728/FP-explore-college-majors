It wasn't cohesive- it jumped around a lot. I get that they wanted to fit a lot of information (Jesus' entire life) into a short amount of time, but perhaps that was just too tall an order.  There may be a reason why most cartoons break up His life into segments and you have to watch several to get the whole story.  Probably won't be watching it again in my house.",2,Tried too hard,1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,564,"['pro', 'kept', '2', 'year', 'old', 'attention', 'most', 'video', 'nothing', 'offensive/contentious', 'denominations', 'should', 'be', 'fine', 'it.The', 'cons', 'was', 'checking', 'watch', 'less', '10', 'minutes', 'was', ""n't"", 'cohesive-', 'jumped', 'lot', 'get', 'wanted', 'fit', 'lot', 'information', 'Jesus', 'entire', 'life', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'tall', 'order', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'most', 'cartoons', 'break', 'up', 'life', 'segments', 'have', 'watch', 'several', 'get', 'whole', 'story', 'Probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'house']",N/A

I got the dvd free just because I was willing to review it, but the views expressed here are completely my own.Read and Share Bible, Life and MiraclesWhat I liked:The animation of this dvd was cute.What I didn't like:The way the stories are delivered is a little boring.I thought that this was kind of corny and a little weird, for example, after Jesus heals one woman she gets up and tells Him that He looks thin, to which He responds ""that's because Peter told me about your cheese something or other"" or something to that affect and then she offers to make Him some and He offers to help her ""I know how to make the dough"", He says. Maybe I am just too serious, but I really did not like this part.My conclusion:I don't recommend this dvd.I give this a 2 out of 5 stars.",2,I didn't care for this.,1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,891,"['received', 'DVD', 'Read', 'Share', 'Bible', 'Life', 'Miracles', 'Jesus', 'Series', 'Thomas', 'Nelson', 'BookSneeze', 'program', 'got', 'dvd', 'free', 'just', 'was', 'willing', 'review', 'views', 'expressed', 'here', 'are', 'completely', 'own.Read', 'Share', 'Bible', 'Life', 'MiraclesWhat', 'liked', 'animation', 'dvd', 'was', 'cute.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'stories', 'are', 'delivered', 'little', 'boring.I', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'corny', 'little', 'weird', 'example', 'Jesus', 'one', 'woman', 'up', 'Him', 'thin', 'because', 'Peter', 'told', 'cheese', 'something', 'other', 'something', 'affect', 'then', 'make', 'Him', 'help', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'dough', 'Maybe', 'am', 'just', 'too', 'serious', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'part.My', 'conclusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'dvd.I', 'give', '2', '5', 'stars']",N/A
167740,A24RCBRDXRXR0Y,1400314690,James A. Nichols,"[0, 0]","I was very interested to get the chance to review this for booksneeze. My family has a copy of the Read and Share Bible and was interested in seeing the video version of a few of the stories. I felt this could be a good way to get children more interested in the Bible. The animation for the video was good and fits really well with the way the pictures in the Bible copy look. What I didnt like though is they way they added little extras to the story that are not included in the Bible. I know they wanted the story to flow a little but I dont think you should add to the Word of God and confuse people.I have 3 boys and one sat and watched the whole video, one watched about half, and the other watched just a little. I dont know if that is any indication of how long it can hold a childs interest but I really just think it depends on the kids mood",3,Read and Share DVD,1275955200,"06 8, 2010",2010,852,"['was', 'very', 'interested', 'get', 'chance', 'review', 'booksneeze', 'family', 'copy', 'Read', 'Share', 'Bible', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'video', 'version', 'few', 'stories', 'felt', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'way', 'get', 'children', 'more', 'interested', 'Bible', 'animation', 'video', 'was', 'good', 'fits', 'really', 'well', 'way', 'pictures', 'Bible', 'copy', 'look', 'What', 'didnt', 'though', 'way', 'added', 'little', 'extras', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'Bible', 'know', 'wanted', 'story', 'flow', 'little', 'dont', 'think', 'should', 'add', 'Word', 'God', 'confuse', 'people.I', 'have', '3', 'boys', 'one', 'sat', 'watched', 'whole', 'video', 'one', 'watched', 'half', 'other', 'watched', 'just', 'little', 'dont', 'know', 'indication', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'hold', 'childs', 'interest', 'really', 'just', 'think', 'kids', 'mood']",N/A
167741,A63KHO6HG4HTR,1400314690,ReviewsCurtasia,"[0, 0]","A simple DVD containing many very short stories about the life of Jesus, miracles He performed and His life.  This DVD would be good for young children up to 10 years old.I liked this short DVD. It did a good job of showing lots of his miracles in easy to understand words, and allow the kids to see a lot of Jesus' miracles.  After that (10 minutes or so) it started to slow down and showed more details about what was going on.  The message of Christ was clearly shown.I liked how they portrayed Judas also.  They didn't show him as a bad guy in the beginning, but as a guy who turns upon pressure.The time frame for the whole movie was from right after his first miracle up to the Lord's Supper.I would recommend this to anyone with young children (my 4 love it) and would be very interested in seeing others from this series",5,Read and Share Bible dvd,1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,828,"['simple', 'DVD', 'containing', 'many', 'very', 'short', 'stories', 'life', 'Jesus', 'performed', 'life', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'young', 'children', '10', 'years', 'old.I', 'liked', 'short', 'DVD', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'lots', 'miracles', 'easy', 'understand', 'words', 'allow', 'kids', 'see', 'lot', 'Jesus', 'miracles', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'started', 'slow', 'down', 'showed', 'more', 'details', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'message', 'Christ', 'was', 'clearly', 'shown.I', 'liked', 'how', 'portrayed', 'Judas', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'bad', 'guy', 'beginning', 'guy', 'who', 'pressure.The', 'time', 'frame', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'right', 'first', 'miracle', 'up', 'Lord', 'Supper.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'young', 'children', '4', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'interested', 'seeing', 'others', 'series']",N/A
167742,A10UPYF30K74H0,1400314690,"Trinity Rose ""book lover""","[0, 0]","This DVD was delightful. Full of color, 3D animation, and fast paced action.Any child would love to watch this 30-minute story of Jesus calling the disciples, healing the sick, teachings about God, and Passover. I found it to be quite truthful and followed along with the Bible, but with simple animation and the stories don't always go into much detail. So very young children can watch this and follow along. My teenagers watched this DVD and it held their interest, so you know this has to be good.This DVD also includes 13 trailers of other neat children's DVD's you can buy.  Like Max Lucado's Hermie & Friends, God's Little Princess gigi, Bibleman, and others. Also an interview with the writer/director Wayne Zeitner. Which was very interesting and informative. You can even find some coloring pages to print for your child. So I really think if you have small children or if you know of a family with small children this would be perfect for your library. I don't have small children anymore, but have one super, wonderful grandson that will be getting this DVD.Disclosure of Material Connection: I receive books free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their Book Review Blogger program/BookSneeze.
