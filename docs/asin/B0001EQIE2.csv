Go watch some 70's horror (The Omen, The Changeling, etc.) if you want to see some real horror.  The stuff they keep coming out with nowadays is so cliche and been-there-done-that.  This movie tries to break new ground, but ends up stuck in the mud because the whole plot is simply unbelievable.  How come the cell phone battery ran out but the laptop didn't.  And how could they transfer data between the laptop and the game studio when there weren't any phone lines.  Wifi?  Yeah right, in the middle of nowhere?  Some things about this movie are just unbelievable and thrown together.  I have to give them +'s on the creepiness of the place... and the best part was when the music box started playing... but again this has been done before many times.  I did enjoy the paintings though.  That's one thing they got right--atmosphere.  I think if this movie could've dropped the quirky Japanese video game subculture rant it would've been much better.  As it is, I wouldn't rent it knowing what I know now.

802879,A2HAZG8D1LNVP2,B0001EQIE2,"John Kolecki ""-J. Ko""","[5, 7]","Before I go off on my rant, let me qualify this review.  This is for the DVD, dubbed in english (no subtitles). Okay, let's begin. I was initially attracted to this because the DVD cover art said that it was directed or created by the guy who made the japanese movie which was based off &quot;the ring&quot;.  I really liked &quot;the ring&quot;, and was hoping to see this guy do some more good stuff.... WRONG.  I am sick of people taking a video game idea and trying to make a movie out of it, and visa versa.  (Lord of the Rings was an excellent book series, a good set of movies and an &quot;ok&quot; set of games)  My point being, that with each &quot;translation&quot; from book to movie and from movie to video game, some thing &quot;gets lost&quot;.  This movie, however has no bones about jumping back and forth between the two genres and at points even has video rendered scenes with live action characters, etc...  (this may be a blanket statement, but here it goes) the japanese are obsessed with the video game/movie switch off junk.  This movie gets to the ridiculous, by even having an &quot;alternate ending&quot; built in.  So let's sum up, its a game, no its a movie, no its a movie about a game... no wait.. its... CRAP. To quote an 80s icon : &quot;I pity the fool...&quot; that rents this junk... I REALLY pity the fool that pays late fees for not returning this junk on time and downright feel awful for the poor saps that BOUGHT this mess.

802880,A1V56VVOO8HIBI,B0001EQIE2,"John Pines ""elargo2000""","[0, 0]","Based on a Japanese novel, like the Ring movie and produced by the same person, this movie has a very creepy edge and a low budget feel that has been missing from US movies for decades. Other than Kaiju movies and anime, Japan has a knack for the ghost story and this movie is a great example of it. With the focus around a group of students making a video game, one of them named Naomi is searching for the roots of her past and makes it the basis of the video game they are programming. Slowly, the video game transforms into a real effort, on Naomi's part, to find out the secret of how she was orphaned and the background of her father who was a deranged painter. These paintings done by her father are reminiscent of the style of those chilling portraits in Rod Serling's 'Night Gallery' television series. More of a mystery than a true horror film, gradually we find out the truth about Naomi, her father, and most of the circumstances surrounding her strange family. The answers to the questions regarding Naomi and her past are not that surprising and somewhat expected. However, the final answer is not what this movie is really about and it is the bizzare journey to that destination. This film has a creepy mood that spreads like a rash and has a lingering affect after the film is over. It's pacing is vagually like the Ring movie, but the story is a great deal tighter. This is not a movie like a haunted house ride, but a gradual revelation to a chilling mystery that is even more than you could have guessed at.",4,creepy video game,1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,1526,"['Based', 'Japanese', 'novel', 'Ring', 'movie', 'produced', 'same', 'person', 'movie', 'very', 'creepy', 'edge', 'low', 'budget', 'feel', 'been', 'missing', 'US', 'movies', 'decades', 'Other', 'Kaiju', 'movies', 'anime', 'Japan', 'knack', 'ghost', 'story', 'movie', 'great', 'example', 'focus', 'group', 'students', 'making', 'video', 'game', 'one', 'named', 'Naomi', 'searching', 'roots', 'past', 'basis', 'video', 'game', 'are', 'programming', 'Slowly', 'video', 'game', 'real', 'effort', 'Naomi', 'part', 'find', 'out', 'secret', 'how', 'was', 'orphaned', 'background', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'deranged', 'painter', 'paintings', 'done', 'father', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'style', 'chilling', 'portraits', 'Rod', 'Serling', ""'Night"", 'Gallery', 'television', 'series', 'More', 'mystery', 'true', 'horror', 'film', 'gradually', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'Naomi', 'father', 'most', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'strange', 'family', 'answers', 'questions', 'regarding', 'Naomi', 'past', 'are', 'not', 'surprising', 'somewhat', 'expected', 'However', 'final', 'answer', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'bizzare', 'journey', 'destination', 'film', 'creepy', 'mood', 'rash', 'lingering', 'affect', 'film', 'pacing', 'vagually', 'Ring', 'movie', 'story', 'great', 'deal', 'tighter', 'not', 'movie', 'haunted', 'house', 'ride', 'gradual', 'revelation', 'chilling', 'mystery', 'even', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'guessed']",St. John's Wort
802881,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0001EQIE2,Jonathan Appleseed,"[5, 5]","To make a correction, this isn't a movie version of a video game. It's an adaptation of a novel, and the novel itself used the perspective of creating a video game to stage the story. Not that it makes much difference, because that's kind of where they lost me. Not too far along into the film it is obvious that the video game isn't central or necessary to the plot, and whenever something isn't central or necessary to a plot, it needs to be excised.This is a movie about a girl who inherits a house when her father dies, a house that may or may not have some hidden secrets. As she does artwork for a small group (three people) who design video games, and they want to use the inside of her father's mansion as a design for their next video game, she and her ex-boyfriend, the head of the group of game designers, go to the house to check things out.The film's title, St. John's Wort, also an ancient word for ""Revenge"", figures into the movie in odd ways. The name of the flower is uttered by the main character's ""Mom"" (or, aunt who raised her) right before she died. Why? Who knows? The movie doesn't tell us. The flower itself appears in the lower right hand corner of paintings done by the main character's father (who was apparently a genius, but also plainly a lunatic). But again, why? It doesn't make sense for the father to have painted them there, and the only sense we get of any ""revenge"" comes at the end, but it's so flimsy and ill fitted to the rest of the story that it smacks of, ""It was all a dream"". Not quite that bad, but it just doesn't make any sense.Lots of things don't make sense. Can a girl who's stabbed her eyes out open them? Or, perhaps the better question is, should we be able to see her eyes when she opens her eyelids after having stabbed her eyes out? Why would someone take a shower in a filthy, disgusting bathroom with pipes that haven't been used in years? It's not a typical horror film, so why, after a strange and entirely unexplained attack, would two people who just promised to stick together do the exact opposite? How can video shots of a house be used to make an accurate rendering of actual floor plans that reveal hidden places? (I'd like to say more about that, but I'd be giving some things away).If you had an adding machine, and started punching in some of these elements, you'd come up with a jumbled mess at the end of your tape, as if the adding machine's tape became jammed part of the way through your process. In other words, this movie doesn't add up.The only points it gets are for production value.

The Ring) I thought it was going to be a very good and creepy movie. Well, until I saw that the production company for this DVD was ""The Asylum"" then my expectations were slightly lowered, but I still thought it could be a decent film. Boy, was I wrong... The acting is terrible, the plot is lame and predictable, and the characters aren't very convincing. Worse still is since this is based off of some hit Japanese video game, they like to mix in alot of 3D backdrops and weird text scenes that make it particularly cheesey! Also, you can tell just how low budget this movie was due to the fact that it only has 4 actors in it!!!Now, I usually like Asylum films because they're so cheesy that they're funny, but with this one, not so much... Sure the guy with Tenchi's voice who must mutter the name ""Kaosawa Suichi"" some 20 times in a 10 minute period, and the weird blonde chick who dresses like a prostitute were funny at first, but the overall dullness of the film doesn't even make it worth watching for a laugh.I rated this movie 2 stars only because I didn't absolutely hate it, and since I only paid 6 bucks for it, I don't really feel bad about buying it. And the fact that the mansion the movie is filmed in looks a lot like Spencer Mansion from the first Resident Evil game was interesting.However, this movie should be avoided.

802885,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0001EQIE2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Otogiriso (Ten Shimoyama, 2001)Over the almost-decade since its release, the Japanese horror flick Otogiriso (in English, St. John's Wort) has grown into a bona fide underground sensation, but not in the same universal-acclaim way Ring did. No, Otogiriso is a movie that divides people in much the same way The Blair Witch Project did; those who love it will probably be fans for life, and those who hate it really, really, really hate it. Count me among those who loved it, though I'm not as rabid about it as most fans of the film; I can understand some of what the detractors of the film say (and it's undeniable that Shimoyama was a strong influence on both Uwe Boll and William Brent Bell, both of whom should have been stopped before making their second movies), and some of it is valid, but it's kind of like Alien vs. Predator; I knew I was supposed to hate it, but I couldn't, because it's such a damn good time.Otogiriso (and for those of you wondering about the plant's supposed mood-elevating properties, it's explained early on in the movie that St. John's Wort is an old Japanese symbol for revenge) is the story of a software development company. Okay, no it isn't, but the four core characters work at a software development company. The head of the company and the head designer, Kohei (Sad Vacation's Yoichiro Saito), just had kind of a bad breakup with the team's head artist, Nami (Shutter's Megumi Okina--yes, it's the ubiquitous Japanese ghost girl playing a normal role!), and Nami is pulling away from the company, though she's still hanging around to finish the art for the game they're developing--a game based on her dreams. The coder geek of the bunch, and the network guy (this is important later), is Shin'ichi (The Sword of Alexander's Koji Ookura in his screen debut), and the level designer is Toko (Reiko Matsuo, who normally works as an anime voice artist). In any case, Nami's father has just passed away, and she has inherited the old mansion out in the middle of nowhere. Kohei offers to drive her, though whether it's just to patch things up and keep her working for the company or whether to try and win her back we're not entirely sure. When they get to the house, Kohei discovers a lot of Soichi Kaizawa art on the walls and goes gaga--Kaizawa is one of his favorite artists. At which point Nami mentions that Kaizawa was her father. (You'd think they'd have had that discussion at some point.) In any case, this is a Japanese horror film, you know what's going on. They're not alone in the house. Is the menacing presence in the house just the creepy caretaker, or is something else after them?Yes, things get a little whamped as time goes on, and some people see the movie's final five minutes as adding to the whamp factor, but I get what Sento (producer of Ring, working on his first screenplay) and Nakajima (Dogs) were doing with it, and it didn't bother me one bit; in fact, considering the setup, I found it highly amusing. I do see the criticism that it wasn't sure what kind of movie it wanted to be--the first two-thirds are your basic slow, atmospheric Japanese horror film, while the final third goes straight into based-on-videogame territory--but that's a criticism that can only be levelled in the age of Uwe Boll. Remember that Boll's first piece of videogame tripe, House of the Dead, didn't come out until two years after this, and in 2001, movies based on videogames were not the commodity that they are now. What did Shimoyama have to work from as far as influences, Super Mario Brothers? (Granted, this is not a movie based on a videogame, but one about a videogame that does not yet exist; think of it as a cross between Stay Alive and P. J. Tracy's novel Monkeewrench and you'll be getting somewhere.) But it's got that same slick, effective style as the better videogame movies to have come along since, so I think it kinda-sorta qualifies.In any case, judging by the way everyone else reacts to this movie, you will either love it or hate it, but no one's in the middle on this one. I say turn your brain off and enjoy the ride. *** ",4,Think about the time it was released.

Stringini ""moviman7643""","[3, 5]","(This review is for the subtitled version of the film)I have to say, this is one of the scariest movies I've seen in a long while.  The story is pretty basic, with young Nami finding out about her past due to her coming upon a family mansion.  The nice touches with making everything feel like a video game really helped the mood, and made the sometimes poor effects seem perfect for the tone of the film.  The acting is top notch, and the script is very strong, although the pacing is very slow in the begining.  Luckily once the pace does pick up, it doesn't stop until you reach the end(s).  Yes, there is more than one ending, but it fits with the entire videogame style of the film.  The direction for the film starts off a little sloppy, using to much hand held camera, but once things move away from that, and in to a more normal feel, the movie takes off with a style all it's own.Now, for the life of me, I can't understand why this film has an R rating.  There is almost no on screen violence, and what violence there is, is mostly just hinted at, and never really shown.  Also, there is no sex, no nudity, and very little foul language.  I guess the mood and tone of the film (which gets increasingly darker as the movie goes on) were just to intense for a PG-13, which I feel the film deserves.If you are a fan of horror films, video games, or Asian cinema, pick up St. John's Wort as soon as you can.
