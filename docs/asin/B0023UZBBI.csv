1249095,A17ED9J0J0UJ9G,B0023UZBBI,"A. Gehlke ""Cat Mom""","[0, 0]","As previously mentioned, this movie is based on the Highland High School rugby team in Salt Lake City who just won their nineteenth national championships this year (2009).The story is about talented but troubled Flagstaff high school rugby player Rick Penning (Sean Faris) who gets into a car crash after drinking and driving recklessly, which puts his girlfriend in the hospital and him in juvenile detention.  Home administrator Marcus Tate (Sean Austin) offers Rick a chance to get back in the game by playing for his rival, Highland Rugby.  Reluctantly Rick joins the team where he goes through a demanding training schedule and unique code of conduct that Coach Larry Gelwix (Gary Cole) enforces.  Rick eventually learns that winning isn't everything, but attitude is.  He ends up facing his old team, who is coached by his father, Richard Penning (Neal McDonough) in the National Championship.In the special features section, real life Coach Larry Gelwix discusses his codes of conduct such as, ""Attitude and effort are more important than natural smarts. Attitude and effort are more important than natural ability.  But if you want to change your attitude there's only one way to do it -- you change your behavior.""Being that I only go to the theatres maybe twice a year, I had never heard of this movie until it was suggested on my movie rental list.  My family watched it a week ago and we totally enjoyed it!  I though it was especially great for my 12 year old son because of its powerful messages of integrity, honor and hard work.",5,Highly Recommended!,1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,1545,"['previously', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'based', 'Highland', 'High', 'School', 'rugby', 'team', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'who', 'just', 'won', 'nineteenth', 'national', 'championships', 'year', '2009', '.The', 'story', 'talented', 'troubled', 'Flagstaff', 'high', 'school', 'rugby', 'player', 'Rick', 'Penning', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'who', 'car', 'crash', 'drinking', 'driving', 'recklessly', 'girlfriend', 'hospital', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'Home', 'administrator', 'Marcus', 'Tate', 'Sean', 'Austin', 'Rick', 'chance', 'get', 'back', 'game', 'playing', 'rival', 'Highland', 'Rugby', 'Reluctantly', 'Rick', 'team', 'where', 'demanding', 'training', 'schedule', 'unique', 'code', 'conduct', 'Coach', 'Larry', 'Gelwix', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'enforces', 'Rick', 'eventually', 'winning', ""n't"", 'everything', 'attitude', 'up', 'facing', 'old', 'team', 'who', 'coached', 'father', 'Richard', 'Penning', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'National', 'Championship.In', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'real', 'life', 'Coach', 'Larry', 'Gelwix', 'codes', 'conduct', 'such', 'Attitude', 'effort', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'natural', 'smarts', 'Attitude', 'effort', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'natural', 'ability', 'want', 'change', 'attitude', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'do', 'change', 'behavior', 'Being', 'only', 'go', 'theatres', 'maybe', 'twice', 'year', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'suggested', 'movie', 'rental', 'list', 'family', 'watched', 'week', 'ago', 'totally', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'especially', 'great', '12', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'powerful', 'messages', 'integrity', 'honor', 'hard', 'work']",Forever Strong

A boy who leads a frat boy wild child life in high school gets sent to the Juvenile home after injuring his girlfriend while driving drunk.  His Mother is an enabler so to speak and his father is solely concerned about winning rugby at all costs.  While at the Juvenile home he is miserable and tries to make everybody else miserable.  Until, he is sent to play Rugby with the Highland team.  His Dad's team's rival.  Resentful at first he finally starts becoming a part of the Highland team and the coach's philosophy that while he wants to win, it isn't at all costs.  He even takes a loss to teach the boys a lesson.  In a twist to the story, the boy is reformed,sent home, then sent back to the juvenile home after an episode with his Dad's team's players.  But, all turns out well at the end.  The boy does a good job of acting like the typical jock jerk until his reformation. And the movie is pretty well done.

Them being the young little girlie girls they are, I could not believe it when they described a rugby movie, very much geared towards young men. I also was wary of the PG-13 rating, but their parents apparently approved, so we put it in. Just a few minutes into it, I was hooked! ""Forever Strong"" is an amazing movie that, unlike so many mainstream movies today, shows the consequences for drugs and DUI and other reckless choices.Apart from a little bit of wishy-washy Mormonism teaching and a scene where the main character flips someone off (it's mostly obscured, as seen on the edge of a security camera), this movie is nearly perfect. There's no verbal foul language, no sex or nudity (the party scenes feature girls in bikinis and a little flirting, but the directors kept it tame, and while older audiences know what would be going on, younger kids won't be exposed to anything inaproppriate. The rugby scenes get a little rough, but nothing graphic at all.I highly reccomend this movie to anyone--families, girls, guys...it would make an excellent group movie night flick.

1249145,A38VQ2TIPPBKNN,B0023UZBBI,"Sir Charles Panther ""Life is hard.  It's hard...","[83, 88]","USA Rugby partnered well with this film's producers and distributors when it opened, and a lot of rugby clubs held screenings all over the country as fundraisers; I went to the TC Williams Rugby showing in Alexandria, Virginia.  Unfortunately, this film was packaged as, and consequently was received by the American movie-going public as ""the rugby movie.""  So unfortunately it didn't do well, and was out of theaters quickly.  That's too bad, as this is not arugbymovie.  It's a movie about values and ethics, honesty and integrity, honor and respect, about family and team, and ultimately about growth, redemption, and the transformative power of making a genuine effort, set in the context of rugby.This is an excellent family film, and even better for just dads and sons to watch together.  For the non-rugby viewers: it doesn't matter if you don't know a thing about rugby.  For the ruggers: you'll love a well-crafted movie on teamwork, with accurate portrayals of our game.This movie is not about rugby; it's about teaching young men the value of teamwork, camaraderie, and that everyone benefits when you become part of something bigger than yourself.  This movie is about sacrifice, honor, integrity, and the power of working as a group toward a shared goal.  Highland Rugby is the unstoppable juggernaut of American U-19 rugby not because they work harder, but because every single young man in that organization works for the betterment of the team, and not for himself.  In this environment, winning becomes merely a by-product.Synopsis: A talented yet vain high school rugby star ends up in juvie after a DUI.  The angry and arrogant hard case is brought into the Highland rugby program and slowly learns the power of teamwork, selflessness, and becoming part of something bigger, which makes him a better man, and a winner.Comparisons toRemember the TitansandFriday Night Lightsare in order, the only difference here being that the sport is unfamiliar rugby.  No matter; if you or your kids come out of it wanting to see what rugby is all about, all the better.  If you are a rugger, then you will recognize the joy in teamwork you've come to love, enjoy the accurate action sequences, and will be happy to see the game treated very well, with very little modification to make it palatable to the rugby-ignorant greater public.Alcohol and drugs are very clearly portrayed negatively throughout the film, and by the end our hero/former party-boy makes positive choices, on his own and for the right reasons. That being said, this film is not Disney-sweet or preachy, and also shows that these rugby players are not choir boys.  They are very serious hard-chargers who know how to have fun, but fun that is legal and does not bring shame to themselves, their team or their families.Refreshingly, the film does not shy away from the fact that rugby is an intense, full-contact sport and that top-level play is a rough environment.  There are lots of bruises, and a bit of blood.  One player gets a gnarly bloody nose, which he wipes off with grass.  One scene, taking things a bit too far I think, showed a medic pulling a tooth from a gash on a player's forehead.  Now, I've seen this injury myself, more than once, so it's legit, but showing it in the movie is not a good way to get kids--and more importantly their protective parents--to come out to learn and play rugby.The rugby play is excellent, very well represented and accurate.  There are a few very well done action sequences with the camera integrated into the action, with good accompanying sound, which is very much like being involved in actual play.  The match play-by-play integrates well to explain what is happening.  The referee reactions are also completely in keeping with the game, such as when the ref sends our boy off with a red card early in the movie, and when an opponent receives a yellow card near the end.There are some powerful dramatic moments in this film, definitely not maudlin or syrupy, and yes, they did get this 28-years-playing lock forward's eyes to water.As a youth rugby coach, I wish there were a way I could legally make dozens of copies of this film and hand one out to every single one of my players.  No, this movie will not teach them how to play rugby, but if it teaches them about honesty and integrity, and the power of effort and teamwork, then most of my job as coach is already done.Here's my suggestion to readers/buyers: buy a copy, and when you're done with it, give it to a friend, and ask them to pass it on.  I've already done this; let's get this movie moving through the community.  Let's get kids excited about rugby, and whether they play or not, let's get kids to realize the power of ethical behavior, and how it can have immediate and real benefits for them and those around them.Bottom line: This is a straightforward bad-boy teen redemption tale, with a predictable plot line.  You know where it's going to end up, and basically how it's going to get there.  But the characters and story are powerful, and they deliver a very well crafted message of respect, integrity and teamwork, without beating you over the head with the overused Hollywood Message Mallet.  All of this takes place in the context of a real-life high school rugby success story.",5,"A Superb Values Movie, No Rugby Experience Required",1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,5283,"['USA', 'Rugby',

Since the movie states that it was based on true events, I think I enjoyed it even more.  It's great to see how a sport (any sport), coaches and friends/teammates can influence a kid for the better.  If it wasn't for sports, some kids would have taken the wrong path.  If your someone that is involved in sports right now, this movie would be great to watch with your teammates.
