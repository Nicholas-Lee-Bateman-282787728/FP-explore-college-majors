296265,AGTWRSKJ0WEQT,6302112060,David J. Kucharski,"[13, 17]","Okay, that rating may be a little indulgent. But this is truly one of my favorite films. It's a lavish ($2 million budget--quite an amount for 1946!), colorful romance set against the world of classical music.  Catherine McLeod plays a young student who becomes the protegee of Philip  Dorn, an imperious pianist/conductor. McLeod steadily grows in her  performing ability--and her love for Dorn--until she becomes a little bit  TOO good for his masculine ego. And there is also a third point of this  romantic triangle--McLeod's childhood sweetheart, William Carter--waiting  in the wings. . .  It may be too easy today to make fun of classic  Hollywood romantic contrivances. But I've Always Loved You contains some  true narrative surprises, along with the sense of compassionate,  transcendent love that always marked director Frank Borzage's work. This  was the first of three films Borzage made under contract to Republic; I've  seen only two of the three (this one and Moonrise), and both are among the  best films of his long career. His leading lady here, McLeod, was playing  her first leading role (which is evident from her uneven performance, which  improves as the film goes along). Sadly, she never became a major Hollywood  &quot;name.&quot;  If you enjoy classic Hollywood  romances/&quot;women's films,&quot; give I've Always Loved You a try.
