(There's a very brief moment when the shadow of a passing coffin falls over a young woman's face, which then contorts into the most terrifying expression I've ever seen.  I don't know if it was CGI or not, but it's *really* creepy.)It's not exactly non-stop terror and the young heroine's cluelessness occasionally gets irritating, but I still found it preferable to some of the earlier j- and k-horror movies that suffer from disjointed plots and ridiculous inconsistencies.

1001080,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000GB5MOW,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","At face value, THE MAID appears to be another knock-off of the popular Asian ghost films that controlled the early 2000's. Thankfully, it has much more to offer in its unique approach and interesting characters. Rosa is a young Filipino girl that is hired as a maid to an elderly couple in Singapore. Rosa arrives as the seventh lunar month begins in China, a month filled with superstition when the gates of hell open and vengeful spirits are free to roam the Earth. While cleaning, Rosa accidentally disturbs one of the alters used to appease the spirits, opening a door that allows her to see into the spirit world, but one that also allows the spirits access to her. Now, she must find out what it is the ghosts desire before it is too late! THE MAID breaks away from conventional stereotypes by deeply rooting the story in Chinese myth and culture. Rather than being cursed for some violent crime, Rosa incurs the spirits wrath by mistake due to her own naivety. Alessandra de Rossi is very good in the role, bringing with her a gentle sincerity and fright that feels authentic. Unfortunately, the THE MAID traps itself is in the cheap jump scares that are found all throughout the picture. This is where a much subtler score along the same lines of THE EYE would have tremendously saved the film, but instead, it reduces the effectiveness of its tenser moments with a loud shriek and the fleeting image of a pale-faced ghost.

Add to that a title that seems even more tacky... I wasn't expecting much... But i was indeed in for a shock.....The Maid; like it's title, is a tale that is centered around a domestic helper, aged 18, who has travelled to the Philippines to Singapore, in hope to earn money so as to provide a better life for her family back home. Situation is such that money is urgently required to save her ill brother back home.She is employed by an elderly couple, Mr and Mrs Teo who have a mentally-handicapped son Ah Soon. The relationship between all of them is good, and all seems to go well.In chinese mythology, the 7th month of the Lunar Calendar is widely considered the Hungry Ghost festival - when the gates of hell swing open and for 30 days, the dead walk among the living. There are some rules during these months that are praticsed during these months amoung most... of which include - not to turn your head when some1 taps or calls your name over the shoulder... Lot of other rules are also mentioned, and most of these have been brushed off as Old wives tale...The maid (Alessandra De Rossi) brushes them off, and unfortuantely, she gets entangled into the ghostly world....The acting is decent, with my hat going out to Alessandra De Rossi who makes her performance very believable. But what makes this movie a regular scarefest is the fact that the director is trying too hard to scare us that the scares all seem too rehearshed. This film has a very decent premise, and the acting an't too bad... But i would suggest a rental for all those interested, before committing a purchase, as this is a film for only the acquired taste.Dvd wise, Tartan issues the regular stuff-along with Mandarin Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 Surround tracks with a few trailers of it's upcoming movie selections - English subtitles will be available....******** I have just recieved word that the dvd presentation has a very serious problem with it.

During this time the dead spirits walk amongst the living on earth, to 'wreak revenge or repay a kindness', as the narrative intro explains. Given the nature of this picture, you can imagine which one will occur over the next 85 minutes.This is a surprisingly effective bit of creepiness from the Chinese community in Singapore. The story centers around a young Filipino maid who has been hired by a Chinese-Singaporean family at the start of this lunar hell month. The family has an adult mentally-challenged son who acts like a youngster, and manages to intrude on many aspects of the new maid's life. In addition, the maid is able to see the dead spirits walking. The matriarch of the Chinese family explains that she must have angered some to the rising spirits, and it's not long before the burned visage of a young woman haunting her new abode.Our young maid becomes aware that this family is anything but normal, and she's embroiled in a hellacious battle of spirits.  The effectiveness of this film derives from psychological tension and ritual surrounding this macabre Chinese festival. There are brief moments of intense gore and suffering, but largely the film is propelled by mood and character tensions, rather than effects.Asian horror has alot to answer for after creating an avalanche of mediocre copycat films over the last decade. The Maid is refreshing, and reaffirms my faith in the power of this genre, when creativity is directed to the good of the film. Worth a look, even for eyes jaded by eastern-inspired horror.The extras include cast interviews and documentary background surrounding the festival of the dead spirits.

Except for a few ""jump"" scares, the frights were few and far between and not at all terrifying (a huge miscalculation in a horror film).

It uses tension, creepy imagery, and jump-scares to frighten the audience; and it uses them often and effectively. Some scares are predictable and have been done before, while others are original and spine-tingling; for example, there is a creepy scene where the dresser doors continue to open and you can see creepy imagery on the glare of the door; the scene is tense and spooky. It really is a scary film. The story is original, and some parts of the ending were unpredictable, which is a plus. The acting was decent, most of the time. The bulk of the film is in English, in case you're wondering.Overall, The Maid is a genuinely scary film, although it has a few generic/predictable scares and a few unique scares.

1001093,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000GB5MOW,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[8, 9]","The Maid (Kelvin Tong, 2005)Now, I'll say right off that, yes, the critics of this movie have it right: there's nothing here we haven't seen before. But you know what? There are thirty-six plots. Total. (And that's the liberal estimate. I've seen the estimate for the total number of plots in the world whittled down to nine convincingly.) As Al Jourgensen said back in the early nineties, ""it's all been done already."" What you have to try and do, if you're a writer, or a musician, or a filmmaker, is to present it another way, with your own style. I've seen a lot of derivative Asian horror movies recently, and of the lot, The Maid stands out. Why? Because Kelvin Tong has a lot more style than those other guys.Alessandra de Rossi plays Rosa Dimaano, a young Filipino woman hired as a housekeeper by a cosmopolitan, if old-school, couple in Singapore, the Teos (Huifang Hong and Shucheng Chen). The Teos have a mentally challenged son, Ah-Soon (Benny Soh), and Rosa and Ah-Soon quickly become friends. However, the house is haunted, and the Seventh Month celebration (roughly analogous to a month-long version of Dia de los Muertos) is coming. Singaporean society has a long, complex set of rules on how to get through Seventh Month without the dead coming to plague you, but Rosa doesn't know them, and gleefully stumbles through her existence breaking them right and left until the dead start noticing her.This is good stuff. Tong spends most of his time building tension rather than going for the jumps and relies heavily on atmosphere to do his dirty work for him. It doesn't work as well as it would if the movie weren't quite as predictable as it is, but this is mitigated by a cast of intriguing characters. Benny Soh, especially, plays Ah-Soon with the perfect mix of childlike innocence and the menace of an adult who can't tell right from wrong. And de Rossi, the most experienced actor in the cast by far, brings a wonderful naivete to her part.I liked it. See it on the big screen if you can. Surround sound and a dark theater will definitely get you into the spirit of things. *** ",4,Another atmospheric ghost story from the far east.,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,2099,"['Maid', 'Kelvin', 'Tong', '2005', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'say', 'right', 'off', 'yes', 'critics', 'movie', 'have', 'right', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'thirty-six', 'plots', 'Total', 'liberal', 'estimate', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'estimate', 'total', 'number', 'plots', 'world', 'whittled', 'down', 'nine', 'convincingly', 'Al', 'Jourgensen', 'said', 'back', 'early', 'nineties', 'been', 'done', 'already', 'What', 'have', 'try', 'do', ""'re"", 'writer', 'musician', 'filmmaker', 'present', 'way', 'own', 'style', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'derivative', 'Asian', 'horror', 'movies', 'recently', 'lot', 'Maid', 'out', 'Why', 'Kelvin', 'Tong', 'lot', 'more', 'style', 'other', 'guys.Alessandra', 'de', 'Rossi', 'Rosa', 'Dimaano', 'young', 'Filipino', 'woman', 'hired', 'housekeeper', 'cosmopolitan', 'old-school', 'couple', 'Singapore', 'Teos', 'Huifang', 'Hong', 'Shucheng', 'Chen', 'Teos', 'have', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'son', 'Ah-Soon', 'Benny', 'Soh', 'Rosa', 'Ah-Soon', 'quickly', 'become', 'friends', 'However', 'house', 'haunted', 'Seventh', 'Month', 'celebration', 'roughly', 'analogous', 'month-long', 'version', 'Dia', 'de', 'los', 'Muertos', 'coming', 'Singaporean', 'society', 'long', 'complex', 'set', 'rules', 'how', 'get', 'Seventh', 'Month', 'dead', 'coming', 'plague', 'Rosa', ""n't"", 'know', 'gleefully', 'stumbles', 'existence', 'breaking', 'right', 'left', 'dead', 'start', 'noticing', 'her.This', 'good', 'stuff', 'Tong', 'most', 'time', 'building', 'tension', 'rather', 'going', 'jumps', 'relies', 'heavily', 'atmosphere', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'predictable', 'mitigated', 'cast', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'Benny', 'Soh', 'especially', 'Ah-Soon', 'perfect', 'mix', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'menace', 'adult', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'right', 'wrong', 'Rossi', 'most', 'experienced', 'actor', 'cast', 'far', 'wonderful', 'naivete', 'part.I', 'liked', 'See', 'big', 'screen', 'can', 'Surround', 'sound', 'dark', 'theater', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'spirit', 'things', '***']",N/A
