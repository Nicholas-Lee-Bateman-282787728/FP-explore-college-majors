Also, the five families get together and put a hit on Meadow - putting US all out of our misery.  Thank GOD.

895254,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0007YMVWO,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The fifth season of the acclaimed drama `The Sopranos' brought us lots of, well, drama.  There are new developments in the lives of old friends and even some enemies as well as some new characters that make some hefty impacts on the family, both personal and business.  The fifth season builds a lot on the man that is Tony Soprano, maybe even delving deeper into his character than any season before it.  Through his actions we see his line of integrity and responsibility as well as his ruthless demand of respect and unfailing loyalty.  By the time this season draws to a close we know Tony more than maybe we ever have before.There are quite a few things that happen throughout this season that directly affect Tony.  First of all he is dealing with his split from Carmela (as of the last season's finale) and his struggle to remain civil with her while still managing his pride is a hard pill to swallow.  Anthony Jr. is increasingly getting more difficult to deal with and continues to give Carmela heartache over their current situation.  This begins to take its toll on Carmela, especially while watching Tony and AJ's relationship grow deeper.  Tony also has to deal with his recently released cousin Tony Blundetto (or Tony B.).  Tony had been in anticipation of Tony B.'s release but Tony B. seems to have another agenda, an agenda that at the end of the day causes problems not only for Tony but for the entire family.  Tony also meets someone from his father's past, a lover who may or may not be the kind hearted woman she comes off as.With the death of Don Carmine Sr. a new war is born between Carmine's son and his right hand man Johnny Sack.  Both feel rights to the title of Boss and they are both ready and willing to fight (and kill) for that right, exclusively.  This war bleeds into the Soprano family and Tony finds himself on Johnny Sack's bad side, not a side he wants to remain on.As much as `The Sopranos' is and will always be about Tony Soprano, season five is really all about Adriana.  As was learnt in the previous season, Adriana is being pressured by the feds to disclose any and all information she has about Tony and his activities.  Despite her reluctance fear moves her to cooperate, albeit as little as possible.  Throughout the season we are drawn further and further into Adriana's character through her desperation and deception and ultimately her pain and suffering.  Rarely does one feel so connected to a single character but by the end of season five my heart was broken for Adriana.  This of course is all because of a good mixture of writing and Drea de Matteo's brilliant performance.  Thank god she won the Emmy for this!Adriana's relationship with Christopher as well as with Tony is explored deeper in this season, and an episode devoted towards Tony's feelings for Adriana and what appears to be mutual feelings on her part becomes an instant highlight of the season.  It's apparent that she looks up to him and he has a deep seated affection for her as well, most likely from watching her relationship with Christopher bloom, and so this episode alone makes the close of the season all the more devastating.Carmela's character is also fleshed out a great deal in this season.  As she separates herself from Tony for the first time in her life she really becomes her own woman, and her flaws and assets are on display for the audience to pick apart and scrutinize.  As she pursues a relationship with AJ's school advisor facets of her personality come to the fore, facets that maybe we have been blind to times before.  Meadow has finally found the man it appears she'll spend forever with, and this big news affects Carmela in a very big way.Steve Buscemi adds a nice touch to the fifth season.  His portrayal of Tony B. is exceptional and he makes a nice (albeit temporary) addition to the already stellar cast.  Dominic Chianese does a great job (as usual) of exposing Junior for all that he really is, and as his health slips Chianese's performance becomes more memorable.  This year though there are four major standouts from the recurring cast.  Edie Falco just glows as Carmela, and she continues to build upon her already well established character to create someone we all come to know and love.  Michael Imperioli also delves deeper and deeper into Christopher to expose his inner demons and his grapple to suppress them.  I just LOVE what Vincent Curatola has done with Johnny Sack this season.  His ruthless determination to make it to the top is intriguing and stimulating.  But no one deserves praise more than Drea who just soars as the doomed Adriana.  Her performance is stunning in every sense of the word.James Gandolfini, as it goes without saying, is flawless as Tony, but this is something we've come to expect.  It was about this time when I started to wonder what the whole purpose was in having Lorraine Bracco even on the show anymore.  It seems that at this point each and every session between Tony and Dr, Melfi is pretty much the same ol' same, but she has her moments when she's not a complete bore.  Tony Sirico is `spicy' as usual, that crotchety gig really works for him and both Jamie-Lynn Sigler and Robert Iler continue to build layer upon layer on their characters.  As much as Aida Turturro didn't have much to do this season with Janice there is one episode, one scene in particular between her and Tony that proves once again she is a force to be reckoned with.The fifth season is yet again pure brilliance, a season that lives up to the hype and proves to be one of the finest complete seasons, with moments of monumental bliss.  This is a season, much like the season that preceded it, that builds such strong characters we are forced to relate and feel for each and every one of them.  It's seasons like this that make me realize what it is that we lost when `The Sopranos' died...we lost the best thing that ever happened to television.What a shame.",5,Without doubt the greatest show

895255,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,B0007YMVWO,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[15, 48]","The Fifth Season continued the deep downward slide in the series that became apparent during the Fourth Season. Well, the writers and directors are only human.  They produced the first three seasons of what is clearly the best TV serial of all time. We cannot blame them for running out of energy.Yet the faults are obvious.  The most glaring fault is with the editing.  The slow scenes in the Fifth Season became unbearable to watch.  Mr. and Mrs. Soprano getting reconciled and making love! Kid Soprano alias Spoiled Brat grumping his way through every scene. Corrado Soprano a demented shadow of his former self. ""The Sopranos"" is a story about the intersection of the business life and the home life.  In the first three episodes, this intersection was vibrant; we really cared along with Tony Soprano of keeping his home life intact while running his ""business.""  But all the drama of that intersection was played out; there was nothing left but the ghost of the family relationship by the time we got to the Fourth Season.  And by the Fifth Season, it was like treading water--simply boring.While the editor should have cut all these slow parts, the bigger problem is that they were written into the script in the first place.  This suggests that the writers have lost their sense of distance.  Or another way of putting it is that they have fallen in love with their own creation.  THEY think that every single thing the Sopranos do, every single half-smirk on Tony's face, every interminable take on his puzzled expression, is like God's gift to the world.  They just have no idea that viewers are tired of it all.  The first time we saw it we liked it; the second time we tolerated it; but now it's a total turn-off.  There is no drama any more between the business life and the home life.  It's just the family drama of a dysfunctional family.There was much more promise in the business life of the Fifth Season.  Here at least was the idea that Tony Soprano was a lesser king than Johnny Sack of New York, and it was most enjoyable to watch Tony stand up to him even if he eventually had to cave in to him.  This stuff is very true to the lives of the Mafioso upon whom the Sopranos is loosely based.  Also fascinating was the bumbling of the FBI.  This too is as realistic as today's newspaper headlines about the failure of the FBI to apprehend terrorists-in-training prior to 9/11.The psychiatrist plays the interface-enabler between Tony's business and home life.  Her role (and acting) was over-the-top in the first three seasons.  She should have retired gracefully.  In the fifth season, she has lost control of her patient (after telling him to get lost), and he sits in her office not quite knowing what to say or do next.  Their own indecision reflects the indecision of the writers.Acting-wise, the Fifth Season belongs to Christopher.  He has gotten better every time.  His reaction to his girlfriend ratting him out is one of the best pieces of acting I've ever seen.A sixth season is in the works. Obviously it is money-driven.  All the spark of the series has gone. I will ignore it when it comes out unless a whole bunch of Amazon reviewers sing its praises.  But it does have at least a chance of saving the day.  If its writers look back over what they've done, they may come to the realization that they now have a gangster vs. gangster vs. FBI story on their hands.  This is the story that should be front-and-center.  All the right crooks are in place.  Let's stop reminiscing about unfunny home sitcom stuff and show these guys ""doing business.""

A cross between The Godfather and the traditional nuclear sitcom family, the show provided a unique experience for a niche audience that quickly developed into a barrage of dedicated fans. Nominated for countless Emmy's, and winner of at least four in every one of its seasons except Season 2 (in which it carried home one), The Sopranos has cemented itself as one of the elite shows in television history...Golden Globe performer James Gandolfini plays the title role of Tony Soprano, a middle-aged father of two, loving husband, and successful businessman. But contrary to a typical sitcom, Tony finds himself irritated by his kids Anthony and Meadow (Robert Iler and Jamie Lynn Sigler), he cheats on his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), and the business organization responsible for his success is the mafia (of which he is the local boss). All the confusion in Tony's life leads to massive amounts of stress, prompting him to regularly visit a therapist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) - one of the few outsiders he trusts. Following a classic prime time soap opera format, quite similar to the hit TV show Dallas, The Sopranos provides audiences with a glimpse into the life and times of a mafia boss, where we find out that being a mob kingpin isn't the glamour life often portrayed in the movies...The Sopranos (Season 5) DVD offers a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere ""Two Tonys"" in which Tony makes a play for Dr. Melfi following his recent separation from Carmela, but Carmela calls on Tony for help in fending off a bear that keeps returning to their house. Meanwhile, Christopher gets in an argument with Paulie when he realizes he's always stuck paying for dinner... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include ""All Happy Families..."" in which Tony and Carmela fight over A.J.'s behavior while Carmela becomes interested in A.J.'s school guidance counselor, and ""Marco Polo"" in which Tony and Carmela reunite (at least for one evening) after she invites Tony to her father's birthday party...Below is a list of episodes included on The Sopranos (Season 5) DVD:Episode 53 (Two Tonys)Episode 54 (Rat Pack)Episode 55 (Where's Johnny?)Episode 56 (All Happy Families...)Episode 57 (Irregular Around the Margins)Episode 58 (Sentimental Education)Episode 59 (In Camelot)Episode 60 (Marco Polo)Episode 61 (Unidentified Black Male)Episode 62 (Cold Cuts)Episode 63 (The Test Dream)Episode 64 (Long Term Parking)Episode 65 (All Due Respect)The DVD Report",5,A truly great series...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2634,"['Sex', 'City', 'HBO', 'original', 'series', 'Sopranos', 'took', 'world', 'storm', 'late-1990s', 'cutting', 'edge', 'drama', 'acerbic', 'wit', 'cross', 'Godfather', 'traditional', 'nuclear', 'sitcom', 'family', 'show', 'provided', 'unique', 'experience', 'niche', 'audience', 'quickly', 'developed', 'barrage', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'Nominated', 'countless', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'least', 'four', 'one', 'seasons', 'Season', '2', 'carried', 'home', 'one', 'Sopranos', 'cemented', 'one', 'elite', 'television', 'history', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'performer', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'title', 'role', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'middle-aged', 'father', 'two', 'loving', 'husband', 'successful', 'businessman', 'contrary', 'typical', 'sitcom', 'Tony', 'irritated', 'kids', 'Anthony', 'Meadow', 'Robert', 'Iler', 'Jamie', 'Lynn', 'Sigler', 'wife', 'Carmela', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'business', 'organization', 'responsible', 'success', 'mafia', 'local', 'boss', 'confusion', 'Tony', 'life', 'massive', 'amounts', 'stress', 'prompting', 'regularly', 'visit', 'therapist', 'Dr.', 'Jennifer', 'Melfi', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'one', 'few', 'outsiders', 'Following', 'classic', 'prime', 'time', 'soap', 'opera', 'format', 'quite', 'similar', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'Dallas', 'Sopranos', 'audiences', 'glimpse', 'life', 'times', 'mafia', 'boss', 'where', 'find', 'out', 'being', 'mob', 'kingpin', ""n't"", 'glamour', 'life', 'often', 'portrayed', 'movies', 'Sopranos', 'Season', '5', 'DVD', 'number', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Two', 'Tonys', 'Tony', 'play', 'Dr.', 'Melfi', 'following', 'recent', 'separation', 'Carmela', 'Carmela', 'Tony', 'help', 'fending', 'off', 'bear', 'returning', 'house', 'Meanwhile', 'Christopher', 'argument', 'Paulie', 'when', 'always', 'stuck', 'paying', 'dinner', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '5', 'include', 'Happy', 'Families', 'Tony', 'Carmela', 'fight', 'over', 'A.J', 'behavior', 'Carmela', 'becomes', 'interested', 'A.J', 'school', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'Tony', 'Carmela', 'reunite', 'least', 'one', 'evening', 'Tony', 'father', 'birthday', 'party', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Sopranos', 'Season', '5', 'DVD', 'Episode', '53', 'Two', 'Tonys', 'Episode', '54', 'Rat', 'Pack', 'Episode', '55', 'Where', 'Johnny', 'Episode', '56', 'Happy', 'Families', '57', 'Irregular', 'Margins', 'Episode', '58', 'Sentimental', 'Education', 'Episode', '59', 'Camelot', 'Episode', '60', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'Episode', '61', 'Unidentified', 'Black', 'Male', 'Episode', '62', 'Cold', 'Cuts', 'Episode', '63', 'Test', 'Dream', 'Episode', '64', 'Long', 'Term', 'Parking', 'Episode', '65', 'Due', 'Respect', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

But I've come to appreciate James Gandolfini's acting - what a range!  And while some characters are more interesting than others, the whole is greater than any of the pats.True, the kids AJ and Meadow aren't that interesting to watch. But we see new depths and contradictions in Christopher. And  there were some great laugh-out-loud scenes. After beating up his old friend (everybody pays their debts to the mob!), he seems genuinely concerned for the friend's lapse into drinking and drugs. ""Couldn't reach your sponsor? You coulda called me!"" he says.Some scenes were harrowing to watch -- when innocent people got in the way of Tony and his friends. Meadow's boyfriend  Finn (and the scenes with just the two of them) initally seems dull. But then Finn oversteps  Tony's boundaries, and later agrees to take a job on one of Tony's construction sites.  He's achingly vulnerable.And, in her way, so is Adriana.  As Drea de Matteo says, she's innocent - the only character in the series who's not trying to get something out of somebody.  The FBI leans on her hard and she has no idea what to do.  So she does the worst possible thing.  Adriana's last scene is painful and hard to forget.We also get a broader sense of Tony's childhood -- lying to his mother to protect his father, discovering his father's mistress (who seems to fit right in, morally), love-hate with his cousin.But  once you're tapped by the Feds, there's no way out.  Prison is supposed to be the honorable option. But has anyone noticed that everyone who comes out of prison ends up dead?I found the audio commentaries disappointng although Buscemis was best. He had really thought about the characters and he contributed some intereseting  insights. The others focused on themselves and their relationship to the series.If you're going to bother with an audio commentary, at least tell the commentator what to do.

It had the action and violence to get the fans back who went wayward in season 4, sure, but what it REALLY has is the most astonishing depth of characters ever put on the small screen. The escalation of Adriana's story - from nearly weeping a confession in ""The Rat Pack,"" to her suspicious car crash with Tony in ""Irregular Around the Margins,"" to the unforgettable death that makes ""Long Term Parking"" one of the most unshakeable Sopranos hours ever proves that this show is nothing but a master at plotting - and at humanity.  Drea de Mateo is so unforgettable, she should be the true hero of the season, but I'm afraid James Gandolfini has gone farther this season than in all the previous four combined.  His scenes with Dr. Melfi have a renewed air of importance, and as the guilt over Tony B grows and grows, we're left with some of the most staggering truths about him we've yet to encounter.

Unfortunately, NY boss Carmine Sr. suffers a stroke and dampens the proceedings. A dense and involving first ep that also features a funny subplot between Paulie and Christopher.Episode 2 - ""The Rat Pack"" - Jack Masserone is suddenly very chatty with Tony, and Tony wonders why. The painting that Masserone gave him may be a psychological giveaway. The FBI is turning the screws to Adriana, who almost gives away her secret at ladies night, but later finds a way to make it useful for her. Carmine Sr. passes away, and his son Carmine Jr. and consiglieri Johnny Sack look to be headed to war; Tony wants no part of it. Everyone rejoices as Tony B is released from prison, but what he wants now that he's out is to go straight. And Tony's not happy about it.Episode 3 - ""Where's Johnny?"" - Johnny Sack strikes first to consolidate control of NY quickly by whacking soldier Lorraine Calluzzo, and Tony's still trying to stay neutral, waiting to pick up ""crumbs from the fallout"". Feech and Paulie aren't exactly getting along on the home front. Junior keeps busting Tony's chops but it's not intentional; his condition is getting much worse. A very poignant emotional end to this one.Episode 4 - ""All Happy Families"" - Feech is causing all sorts of problems for Tony, who remembers Richie Aprile and decides Feech has to go. He comes up with a clever method of dispatching him. Carmine Jr. wants to retaliate for the hit on Lorraine Calluzzo. A.J. has a crazy night out in Manhattan and an exaperated and resentful Carmela sends him to live with Tony - much to Tony's chagrin.Episode 5 - ""Irregular Around the Margins"" - A great episode, alternatingly very funny and very dramatic in typical Sopranos style. Adriana and Tony are caught in a awkward position and though nothing happened, everyone's talking. Christopher can't take it and is going bonkers. Tony may have to do something drastic about his hotheaded nephew until Tony B comes up with a plan that saves face (and possibly a lot more) for everyone.Episode 6 - ""Sentimental Education"" - Tony B gets an unexpected offer in his quest to go straight, with disastrous results. Carmela's loneliness manifest itself in attraction for A.J.'s counselor Mr. Wegler, and she does something daring that she comes to regret very quickly. Will the rest of her life always be clouded because she was married to Tony Soprano?Episode 7 - ""In Camelot"" - Tony goes to visit his father's grave and runs into Fran Felstein, Johnny's old goomah. She appears to be a ""classy broad"" at first but appearances can be deceiving, and she conjures up some painful memories. Tony and Phil Leotardo have a little ""misunderstanding"" about profit distribution. Chris tries to help out his writer buddy JT Dolan, fresh from rehab, but Dolan may have another problem - gambling. And his problems just got a whole lot worse.Episode 8 - ""Marco Polo"" - Tony reluctantly agrees to pay for some damage to Phil's car, and sends her to Pussy's old body shop (now being run by his wife Angie). But Phil isn't too thrilled with the repair job. Carmela wants a surprise 75th birthday bash for her father, who learns of the party from Uncle Junior and throws a fit when he learns Tony isn't coming. Tony does come at Carmela's request and the two share a ""friendly moment"" in the swimming pool after hours. How much did it mean to either of them? Tony B gets involved in the NY struggle in a big way, disobeying direct orders, by whacking NY soldier Joey Peeps for some extra ""freelancing"" cash. All hell is about to break loose...Episode 9 - ""Unidentified Black Males"" - Johnny Sack suspects who hit Joey, and so does Tony. When he confronts his cousin, it doesn't go well. But he still protects him, over his feelings of guilt on the night Tony B got pinched and Tony didn't show. Carmela is angered that the romp in the pool apparently meant nothing to Tony and moves to ""agressively pursue"" divorce proceedings and her share. Tony gets Meadow's boyfriend Finn a job at the construction site, and he learns a dangerous secret about capo Vito Spatafore. Finn and Meadow, after much arguing, have some good news to announce - they're getting engaged. And Finn just literally saved his behind for the forseeable future. A great one.Episode 10 - ""Cold Cuts"" - Johnny Sack is acting up because he knows Tony is protecting his cousin, and Tony isn't too pleased. Janice gets arrested on top of all this, and Tony orders her to get her anger issues under control. Tony B and Christopher have had a strained relationship but get some bonding done while digging up some old friends on their Uncle Pat's upstate farm.Episode 11 - ""The Test Dream"" - In this brilliant, twisty surreal nightmare, Tony B's prison buddy Angelo Garepe is whacked by Phil Leotardo in revenge for Joey Peeps, and everyone is on edge. Tony's goomah Valentina accidentally burns herself, and Tony checks into the Plaza for a good night's sleep. Instead, he has a recurrung dream about his old gym teacher, subconciously asking whether he's ready to ""do what needs to be done"" by associates past and present. He awakes to some bad news - Tony B has killed Billy Leotardo, Phil's brother, in vengeance; Phil is in the hospital. And New Jersey is now fully screwed.Episode 12 - ""Long Term Parking"" - A body was found washed ashore and the feds think Adriana is involved; the perp was a drug dealer at her club and surveillance video shows her acting strangely. They pick her up and she desperately convinces them she might be able to get Christopher to flip. Christopher doesn't take it so well, and Adriana finally gets an overdue vacation. Meanwhile, Johnny Sack finally becomes Don of NY as Carmine Jr. bows out, and both he and Phil want Tony B on a platter. Tony isn't serving up anything...yet. A heartbreaking but inevitable ep, and Michael Imperioli and Drea de Matteo absolutely shine in their blistering final scenes together.Episode 13 - ""All Due Respect"" - Carmela and Tony finally get back together via a mutual ""compromise"". Tony B has been in hiding but Tony knows where he is and he isn't saying. Christopher is becoming a target and good soldier Benny gets a stern beating by NY. The Jersey crews are getting nervous; they all think Tony is being too protective of his cousin at their expense. Their right, and Tony knows it, but he can't give up his cousin so easily. Soon he overcomes his guilt and makes his fateful decision, on his own terms. Johnny Sack and Phil aren't too pleased, but who cares? Tony once again has earned all due respect from his own crew and that's all that matters. But how much has it cost him? As we end Season 5, the feds hit Johnny Sack with Tony right there at his house; he escapes to the safety of his home, with Carmela waiting for him. A perfect ending to a wonderfully executed season.The DVD edition has several standout commentary tracks, most notably acclaimed director Mike Figgis, who guest-directed ""Cold Cuts"" and offers an outsider and fan perspective in his thoughts. Drea de Matteo also offers a laid back track on ""Long Term Parking"" that's not too insightful but pretty honest and informative about her views on her role throughout the show. Overall, Season 5 once again raises the bar for TV in general and ""The Sopranos"" as a whole, and Season 6 is so far doing the same. So if you haven't already bought this set and everything that came before, what are you waiting for?",5,"The Sopranos, Season 5: All Due Respect deserved.",1143331200,"03 26,

The middle class seem to be drawn like moths to a flame when it comes to stories about the Mafia. My in-laws were always hardworking church going people yet they just can't get enough of this show.I was surprised then to find out just how good the show is. The music is very hip and appropriate, the camera work is beautiful, character development is excellent, the scripts contain  creative twists and the tension is always taut. But what that I think is the most interesting thing about the Sopranos is the human interactions and Tony Soprano's  attempts at introspection with his psychologist. Despite the blood and gore (and there is plenty) it is as much about a family as it is about the Mafia.The main focus of the series is Tony Soprano, his wife Carmella and their two kids. Along with them is Tony's therapist (Tony suffers from panic attacks  which almost reminds one of the furies in the Oresteia), Tony's mistresses and Tony's crew and associates.Season five was a particularly good one which included for a brief time Tony's cousin Tony Blundetto (played by Steve Buscemi), Tony's brush ups with Johny Sack (as Sack aspires to head the New York mob) and one episode  consisting mostly of a dream senquence somewhat reminicent of David Lynch's work.Entertaining and worth owning.Jim Connell  ""Hallstatt Prince""",5,Just your typical all American Mafia family -season five,1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,1678,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'HBO', 'was', 'premiering', 'series', 'made', 'mental', 'note', 'not', 'watch', 'it.However', 'when', 'have', 'in-laws', 'living', 'are', 'hard', 'hearing', 'ignoring', 'television', 'trying', 'ignore', 'sound', 'jet', 'engines', 'when', 'live', 'next', 'airport.This', 'tangent', 'hope', 'will', 'indulge', 'middle', 'class', 'seem', 'be', 'drawn', 'moths', 'flame', 'when', 'stories', 'Mafia', 'in-laws', 'were', 'always', 'hardworking', 'church', 'going', 'people', 'yet', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'show.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'music', 'very', 'hip', 'appropriate', 'camera', 'work', 'beautiful', 'character', 'development', 'excellent', 'scripts', 'contain', 'creative', 'twists', 'tension', 'always', 'taut', 'what', 'think', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Sopranos', 'human', 'interactions', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'attempts', 'introspection', 'psychologist', 'blood', 'gore', 'plenty', 'as', 'much', 'family', 'Mafia.The', 'main', 'focus', 'series', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'wife', 'Carmella', 'two', 'kids', 'Tony', 'therapist', 'Tony', 'suffers', 'panic', 'attacks', 'almost', 'one', 'furies', 'Oresteia', 'Tony', 'mistresses', 'Tony', 'crew', 'associates.Season', 'five', 'was', 'particularly', 'good', 'one', 'included', 'brief', 'time', 'Tony', 'cousin', 'Tony', 'Blundetto', 'played', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Tony', 'brush', 'ups', 'Johny', 'Sack', 'Sack', 'head', 'New', 'York', 'mob', 'one', 'episode', 'consisting', 'mostly', 'dream', 'senquence', 'somewhat', 'reminicent', 'David', 'Lynch', 'work.Entertaining', 'worth', 'owning.Jim', 'Connell', 'Hallstatt', 'Prince']",N/A

The brutal push and shove between Little Carmine and Johnny Sack provides the dramatic backdrop as tensions mount between the families. Through it all, Tony tries to maintain neutrality but finds himself, as usual, in the thick of things.On the home front there are several touching and poignant moment between our lovable thug, Tony, and his long-suffering wife, Carmella. Slowly and sweetly, they inch toward each other; each painfully aware of the sensitive issues and the deep divide which separate them. In a grimly amusing scene, Tony may have found Carmella's price.Without question, this is Gandolfini's finest hour. He gives a performance which portrays not only the ruthlessness and thuggery of Tony Soprano but also the maturity, thoughtfulness, humor and depth of a caring husband father. No humanitarian awards just yet, though, this is brutal gangsterism and intimidation of innocents, after all. Carmella, Christopher, and Adriana also deliver their very best performances to date.

The anticipation could not possibly be matched by what we saw every week, and that's just what happened.  A great risk, that this property had become so legendary that it could not possibly deliver, especially when it became a boutique for noted guest directors, some offshore.But I did buy the DVDs when they came out - was pleased at how deeply they were ""discounted,"" among other things.  And they played much better sequentially than seeing each episode separately.Weaknesses:1.  Steve Buscemi's character.  It seems to be in the series to make something for Steve Buscemi to do.2.  Robert Loggia's character.  See no. 13.  Robert Iler's unidimensionality.4.  Meadow, too...5.  The repetitive or formulaic nature of introducing mob friends and mob enemies so they can be dealt with.6.  Worst (least amount of) special features for all the DVDs in the whole series.But then, the strengths:1.  Carmela is more luminous than ever.  Hot, too.  Best wishes for a speedy recovery, Edie!!2.  If it's possible, James Gandolfini is even better - possibly giving his best performances of the whole five seasons.3.  Great, great stuff from the new ""King of New York.""4.  The writing is as strong and real as ever.  It recovers from some of the silliness of Season Four.  Its focus on the continued development of family through the inevitable stages of life is wonderful;  look out for the ""Big Wheel"" shot that concludes an episode on Disk Two...5.  Some of the directorial commentary is really enlightening.6.  ""Ade's"" DVD commentary is perhaps one of the best of all the DVDs;  the degree of investment by the actress is explained in an engaging and wonderful way.  It seems that in this series, everybody cares a lot about what gets to the screen.  Yeah, there might be some dilletantes (Robert Loggia, for example), but no slackers...I know that Season Five did not fulfill many of the expectations of the series' most loyal fans.  But, especially considering how hard it was and long it took to complete this season, we should be grateful.

The fifth season of ""The Sopranos"" was its strongest one since the first season, and Emmy voters finally gave this outstanding series a long overdue honor. ""The Sopranos"" finally won its first Emmy as Best Drama Series (it was about time!) after losing its first four times (first to ""The Practice"" and the next three times to ""The West Wing""). And while James Gandolfini and Edie Falco failed to take home Emmys this time out, two other actors got some well-deserved Emmy recognition. Michael Imperioli and Drea de Matteo won Emmys for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for their roles as Christopher and Adriana. Imperioli and de Matteo have always done great work on the show throughout its entire run, but both stars did some of their best acting during season five, and I was thrilled when they won. ""The Sopranos"" also won again for Best Writing in a Drama Series for the fourth time in the show's history, having previously won in this category for seasons one, three, and four. The show received 20 Emmy nominations for season five, which brings its total Emmy nominations for its first five season to 89. That's quite impressive. Some of the great storylines from the fifth season include: the estrangement between Tony and Carmela (who split up at the end of season four) and their attempt at reconciliation later on; the FBI putting the pressure on Adriana; Tony's relationship with his cousin Tony B. (well played by Steve Buscemi, who directed the great season three episode ""Pine Barrens""); and Tony's strange dream where all the people that were close to him that got whacked in the previous four seasons show up. Viewing ""The Sopranos"" season five is a great way to gear up for the sixth  season, which finally returned after a nearly 2 year hiatus. And I'm sure season six will have it's share of truly memorable moments.

A ""weekly event"" show basically has everyone talking about the episode the next day.  In the 1980s, shows such as ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" were ""weekly events"".  In the 1990s, ""Seinfeld"" would take emerge as the show that would become a ""weekly event"".  As Seinfeld wound up, another show would soon take that title into the 21st century - that show being HBO's ""The Sopranos"".  ""The Sopranos"" would be different in that it was a show that appeared on a premium (pay) cable station and would prove that premium cable stations can produce high quality shows that provide high levels of enjoyment.  I'm wasn't someone who subscribed to HBO so I felt on the ""outside"" on the ""talk"" that surrounded the episodes of ""The Sopranos"".  However that didn't stop my curiosity about wanting to watch the show.  Once I watched ""The Sopranos - The Complete First Season"", I not only got an appreciation for the show - but I now understood where all of the hype came from on this show.  With the exception of a slight tip in the quality of the show during Season 3, the show has maintained both high quality and high entertainment value.  This set, ""The Sopranos - The Complete Fifth Season"" is no exception to why the show among the elite television shows in history.The show focuses on an organized Italian-American crime family that is based in North Jersey.  The main character of the show is Tony Soprano played brilliantly by James Gandolfini.  Tony is the head of the fictional DiMeo crime family.  On the show, we see Tony try to balance his ""work"" in the DiMeo crime family with his home life.  Tony also suffers from panic attacks and depression and therefore sees a psychiatrist - Dr. Jennifer Melfi (played by Lorraine Bracco).Here are some of the key storylines from Season 5:1-Tony Soprano and his wife Carmela (played by Edie Falco) are separated.  During the separation, Carmela has a short-fling with Anthony Soprano Jr's guidance counselor Robert Wengler (played by David Strathairn)2-Tony Soprano's cousin, Tony Blundetto is released from prison.  Originally, Tony B wants to make an ""honest living"" and seeks to get is massage license.  Eventually Tony B will get lured back to mob life and begin to create havic on Tony Soprano's life.3- The New York Mafia has an internal power struggle between Carmine Lupertazzi Jr (played by Ray Abruzzo) and Johnny Sack (played by Vincent Curatola).  Tony Soprano will be caught right in the middle - especially when Tony B gets involved in the power struggle4-Tony Soprano will resume his counseling sessions with Dr. Melfi.  As has been the case with the previous seasons, there still is nothing done to develop either Dr. Melfi's character or her storyline.  This becomes very evident when Tony Soprano attempts to woo Dr. Melfi in Season 5's first episode.  Once again, this storyline will not develop much.5-Christopher Molitsanti (played by Michael Imperioli) will struggle to stay clean and sober following his stint in drug rehabilitation the previous season.  While he will have his problems with Paulie Walnuts and Tony Blundetto, he will face his biggest problems with his fianc&eacute;e Adriana La Cerva (played by Drea De Matteo) and with his ""Uncle"" and ""Boss"", Tony Soprano.6-Adriana will continue to used by the FBI as an informant.  This situation will torment Adriana throughout the year and reach a climax by the season's end.7-Uncle Junior (played by Dominic Chianese) will continue to suffer from dementia  and his condition will worsen throughout the year.8-Meadow Soprano's (played by Jamie-Lynn Di Scala) relationship with dental student Finn DeTrolio (played by Will Janowitz) will continue to grow.  Finn's role will be expanded in Episode 9 - when Tony Soprano gets him a job at a construction site - giving Finn ""interactions"" with several members of the DiMeo crime family.9-Anthony Soprano Jr. (played by Robert Iler) will once again get into trouble both in and out of school - much of which will stem from Tony and Carmela's separation.10-Janice Soprano (played by Aida Turturro) will adjust to married life to Bobby ""Bacala"" Baccalieri (played by Steven R. Schirippa) as well as play mother to his children.  Janice and Bobby will suddenly be seen married in the first episode without any references to when the wedding occurred (there was no hint of Janice and Bobby getting engaged at the end of Season 4).Here are some other points to consider from Season 5:- There are several cameo appearances by famous actors.  These actors include David Lee Roth, Lawrence Taylor, and Annette Bening.  Frankie Valli has a recurring role as Rusty Millio - a solider in the New York Crime Family.- The character who really develops the most is Johnny Sack.  As the season went on, I enjoyed watching him more. This season also introduces another entertaining character - Phil Leotardo (played by Frank Vincent) who works for Johnny.  I also enjoyed Phil as the season progressed.- This season introduces the storyline of Vito Spatafore (played by Joseph R Gannascoli) being gay.- While I didn't enjoy Tony's long dream in episode 11, it does bring back many ""dead"" characters who have cameos - including Richie Aprile, Sal Bonpensiero, and Gloria Trillo.- Perhaps the most interesting episode is episode 5 - involving an attraction between Tony Soprano and Adriana.Season 5 continues a trend on the Sopranos that I refer to as ""the most exciting 60 minutes on television"".  Season 5 backs my claim that the Sopranos is of high quality and entertainment value.. As for the DVD packaging - besides the usual extras, one thing I really liked was how there was a brief textual synopsis provided on the screen before playing the episode.  Overall, this is a very good and entertaining set - highly recommended.",5,Still an Elite Show,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,5890,"['are', ""n't"", 'many', 'television', 'shows', '50+', 'years',

I bought all five seasons at once and finished them in less than two weeks. I am chomping at the bit for season six.This season was a real shock to me in some cases. Between Tony's dealings with his cousin and Feech LaManna, the Phil Leotardo situation, the intense rivalry with Johnny Sack, and the dream sequence, I never knew what to expect next. The ending was especially shocking. I thought Johnny Sack had set Tony up for a hit when I saw people in the background. Especially with the look of fear in Tony's eyes. Did Johnny Sack flinch at first? He looked like he knew what was going on... until he turned around.I thought for sure Paulie was going to get whacked too. And, Feech in retaliation. This shows ability to surprise the viewer is a pleasant change of pace.But perhaps the most shocking moment of the season had to be the departure of Adrianna. I did not see it coming until Silvio stopped in the woods. Can't believe Chrissy sold her out. And speaking of Silvio, is he a cold-hearted summamabitch or what?

The characters are soulless ghouls who drag themselves around in a world that barely maintains their interest.  All of the characters are morally vile.  Their entire life-ethic consists of following the crassest self-interest while behaving as crummily to others as they can get away with.  Why is it worthwhile to watch a bunch of people shambling around in their own living netherworld?  Without redemption and without hope?  You got me pal.  Raymond Chandler once said that in order for a piece of writing to be art it must have the quality of redemption in some form.  This is not art.  This is the glorification of baseness that our popular culture has become.  Consider the fact that sixty years ago, Albert Einstein was a world celebrity.  When he arrived in San Diego aboard an ocean liner, it was stop-the-presses kind of news.  Nowadays the only people who get this kind of coverage are criminals and the actors who portray them.  The Sopranos is yet another installment in the endless parade of disedifitainment which is our modern stand-in for culture.  It is like a fictional reality show.

Yea, the concept of doing a series about the mob is great .It's well acted , some of the episodes are great and some of the characters are great ... but the key word is "" some "" .One of the things I find really irritating about The Sopranos is the fact that they never follow up on a storyline . As an example , in episode 5 of season 5 ,Tony and Adriana come very close to having relations . Rumors start swirling around and Christopher gets wind of it . He confronts Tony . Tony almost kills him -- Awesome !What do they follow it up with ? An episode centering on a relationship with Carmela and one of Anthony Jr.'s guidance councilors . Who care's  ? Then that's followed up with an episode revolving around one of Johnny Boy's old goomahs to be followed up by an episode with Carmela's father's birthday party as the focal point .

895320,ADE852UR9121C,B0007YMVWO,perfecto,"[1, 1]","Wow, what a season! I was pretty late to jump the bandwagon of the critically acclaimed The Sopranos. I don't know, I have heard wonderful things about it but never got around to watching it. Over the course of the last few months, I actually watched all 5 seasons and I have to admit, this show is every bit as excellent as people say it is. I mean, I'm a fan of The Godfather series as much as the guy beside me, but this show, while sharing similar values to The Godfather is in a league of it's own.What stands out about this show? The amazing thing is, I believe asking this same question to the legions of The Sopranos fans would yield different answers and I think that's why this show is one of HBO's gems. The show itself is layered but personally, what sticks in my mind is the richness of characters here. They're not your typical family, but somehow, it plays with the idea that it COULD be. The problems plaguing the families while unexpected, are very real. The relationship between parents and their children, between husbands and wifes, even between the mob families make for a very interesting turn of events. And the glue that holds them together (or sometimes tears them apart) is Tony Soprano. A man, with an intimidating presence yet has a soft side that anyone ever sees. How he's a master at handling the ""business"" but seems to falter when it comes to managing a home is something many people can relate to. His wife, his 2 kids and the people in the mob weave a web around him which makes for an intricate storyline that leaves you in awe.The story is written superbly. Of course, some episodes are better than others...it's not always at it's best, but when it shines, it's almost perfect. I have to comment about the last few episodes of Season 5. They were amazing! What a high tension, emotional and gripping finale it was. Certainly a high point among ALL seasons of The Sopranos. Michael Imperioli and Drea de Matteo deliver powerful performances, certainly worthy of the Emmy nominations they garnered. To be honest, after 4 seasons...you come to expect pretty much anything but this still blew me away.The acting from the rest of the cast are top notch. From reading news that these guys actually get arrested for crimes like bar brawls and drug addiction, you seem to wonder if they really are acting. Well, whatever the case...they deliver performances that are every bit as good as our main man, James Gandolfini, who after 5 seasons still goes strong with his legendary role of Tony Soprano that has earned him numerous Emmy's and other miscellaneous awards. That itself speaks volumes about his acting.Finally, while this show certainly has it's ups and downs, what it represents and tries to depict so well, will go down as one of TV's greatest shows. This is a quality series that would sit well with repeat viewings.

Tony may be running t'ings, but in Season Five he begins to lose his battle for his soul.Season Four ended with a surprise, as Carmela booted Tony out of her beloved McMansion.  Season Five opens with a different kind of bear frolicking in the back yard - an actual black bear.  This kind of subplot would be ridiculous if used by lesser writers, but David Chase and his team make it work.  As they make everything in Season Five work to the story's advantage.A series like the ""Sopranos"" that has such a high body count needs a constant infusion of new blood.  Season Five gets an infusion when a bunch of hoods pinched back in the '80s gets paroled, including Tony Blundetto (Steve Buscemi, hitting heights only surpassed in his work with Joel and Ethan Coen), Tony Soprano's cousin.  These new arrivals exacerbate some simmering tensions between Tony's Jersey crew and the New York family, which has been thrown into chaos by the death of Carmine, Sr.  Johnny Sack and Little Carmine want to take the helm, and Tony S. wants to sit on the sidelines, only that doesn't sit well with either faction from the Big Apple.Also straining things for Tony are Carmela's attempts to forge a new life for herself, A.J.'s continuing underachievement, Chris's heroin addiction, and Adriana's continuing ""relationship"" with the FBI.  Meadow meets another love-of-her-life, who discovers some surprising secrets about the harsh life of the Mafia.  Dr. Melfi continues to occupy Tony's mind, but their relationship is beginning to grow strained.  And Uncle Junior descends further into cancer and dotage.Most of us would collapse under the strain of so many burdens, but Tony soldiers on as best he can.  But it's clear by the end of the last episode that a part of Tony has been sacrificed to his ambition.  In past seasons, we may have wanted to give this murderous thug a bear-hug in spite of his sins.

James Gandolfini is still awesome to watch as Tony Soprano, a New Jersey mob boss who has to deal with gang wars, the FBI breathing down his neck, murders, and yet still deals with problems that the average American family has to deal with such as a rebellious teenage son and a strained marriage. The fifth season comes with the usual 13 episodes including:""Two Tonys"" - Tony Soprano's cousin, Tony Blundetto (played by the awesome Steve Buscemi) is getting out of jail for doing 15 years of hard time. Along with Tony B. is ""the class of 2004"" which means all the old mob bosses, made guys, and captains are getting out of jail as well, so there is a lot of welcome back parties in the works. Don Carmine Sr., who was head of the New York Family, dies from a stroke and it is unclear who is next in line for the top spot, Carmine's son Carmine Jr. or Carmine's right hand man Johnny Sack. Meanwhile Tony decides to confess something to Dr. Melfi and Carmella, Tony's wife, has to deal with her resentful son AJ.""Rat Pack"" - Adriana, the girlfriend of Tony Soprano's nephew Christopher, is being pushed too far by the FBI for incriminating evidence on Tony. Tony Blundetto has new plans in life, new plans that shock Tony about what he wants to do. Carmela wants separation agreement and the feud between Carmine Jr. and Johnny Sack is starting to get out of hand.""Where's Johnny?"" - Johnny Sack strikes first in the war to become the current New York mob boss. Tony is trying to benefit from the stress of naming a new mob boss between Johnny Sack and Carmine Jr. but also has to deal with problems in his own crew. A lawn cutting business is starting to create more problems then necessary and finally Tony's uncle, Uncle Jr., seems to be undermining Tony's authority for some strange reason.""All Happy Families"" - The war between Johnny Sack and Carmine Jr. turns bloody, and the consequences will be severe. Tony Soprano is having trouble with Feech, an ex con who is sticking his nose where it doesn't belong. So a decision is made to ""solve"" the problem, and it may not be solved the way you think...Carmela becomes resentful of Tony's good relationship with AJ, and also decides to have lunch with AJ's school advisor, Mr. Wegler.""Irregular Around the Margins"" - Tony and Adrianna share a sexually charged, awkward moment while they are in Adrianna's club and Tony becomes very troubled by the incident. He talks about it with Dr. Melfi, who says his guilt is a good thing. Tony and Adrianna settle their differences but then get involved in a car crash together, and rumors start flying all over what they were doing in a car by themselves together. Christopher goes into a rampage but then Tony B comes in with a solution that solves everything.""Sentimental Education"" - Tony B's new boss makes him an offer he can't refuse after being impressed by his new devotion to his job. Mr. Wegler and Carmela soon start seeing a lot more of each other, and not all of it is school related. Tony B's new life on the up and up takes a detour, and Carmela soon realizes what it's really like being married to Tony Soprano.""In Camelot"" - Fran Feistein, an older woman who knew Tony's father, meets Tony at a funeral and lets him in on some secrets Tony never knew about his father. Uncle Junior may have found a way to beat his house arrest and lets his lawyer in on the secret immediately. Christopher's friend who just got out of rehab has a gambling problem, and Christopher is torn between being a friend and a collector of debts.""Marco Polo"" - While Tony Soprano tries to stay out of the struggle over the New York mob boss situation, Tony B sees opportunity to gain which leads to a showdown. Carmela's father turns 75 and her mother is scared of what her friends will think of Tony when they meet him. And at the end of this episode, things may look brighter for Tony and Carmela.""Unidentified Black Males"" - Joe Peeps, a member of Johnny Sack's crew, has been killed and Tony is doing everything he can to keep things in control between Johnny Sack and Carmine Jr. Tony B has also been acting peculiarly, which only adds to Tony Soprano's problems. Carmela wants to speed things up in their divorce despite some recent closeness, and finally Meadow and her boyfriend make a big announcement.""Cold Cuts"" - Tony has now more problems that he can deal with. Johnny Sack is hitting Tony where it hurts the most, his wallet, and now Tony is forced to do something about it. Tony's sister Janice is arrested for battery and Tony is angry his name got dragged into the whole mess. Tony B and Christopher head upstate on a special assignment of Tony Soprano's.""The Test Dream"" - In one of the more memorable episodes of the series, let alone this particular season, Tony Soprano is visited by dead acquaintances from the previous four seasons in a very realistic dream. The dream occurs after Tony receives word that yet another gangland hit has been taken, this time it's a close friend of Tony B's. Tony Soprano must now find his cousin before its too late but in the morning Christopher arrives with some disturbing news about Tony B.""Long Term Parking"" - The Feds finally bring in a secret weapon against Adrianna and now are using it to force her to get a move on bringing in incriminating evidence against Tony Soprano. Adrianna now must make a choice, and her decision has a huge impact on how her and her fianc&eacute; Christopher's lives will turn out to be. Meanwhile Tony Soprano and Johnny Sack have a sit down. Johnny Sack wants Tony B, who has disappeared, or all hell will break loose.""All Due Respect"" - In the fifth season finale everyone is looking for Tony B, who is still missing. Tony's crew is still puzzled and frustrated on how Tony can still be protecting his cousin. Meanwhile AJ finally seems to have found something he thinks is worth his time, and Tony and Carmela are a little surprised but pleased. The ending is very dramatic and one great lead into season six.The Sopranos, season five, is an awesome addition to this powerful television series. James Gandolfini is still amazing to watch and everyone else in the show adds more and more with every episode. For those who want violence this season definitely delivers and for those expecting another well acted, dramatic spectacle you wont be disappointed. Highly recommended.",5,The Sopranos Season Five continues the story of Tony Soprano,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,6508,"['Sopranos', 'season', 'five', 'yet', 'great', 'season', 'high', 'intense',

895338,A3N0E03AQD128O,B0007YMVWO,Tony Thomas,"[26, 46]","One might ask why buy this in DVD form when one can see the whole season for the price of HBO or videotape it. My response is that there is no drama that I have seen anywhere more intense or fullfilling than watching these DVDs.The ability to watch several episodes one after the other after the other without stopping provides such a satisfying and unstoppable drama, that is so rivetting, so essential, so emotionally visceral. In fact, I no longer watch the program on HBO.  Each year, I eagerly await the release of the season DVDs and watch them together intensely several times, compressing the watching to a weekend or a week at the most.  There is nothing like it in my 55 years of watching television and video, nothing!The Sopranos work because of the building of tension up in the character Tony Soprano.  Everything else in the show is oriented for that to happen. While he releases tension, sometimes in small increments, the show would collapse and become completely uninteresting if he ever made sense or was relaxed to the degree that most people are. In that, Soprano is the opposite of the typical dramatic hero, especially the typical television hero who may have his or her contradictions and worries, but who always will solve any problem by the end of the episode, or at least the end of the season.  The buildup of tension occurs because the program focuses not only on the physical violence and ""business"" aspects of Tony's mob or the marital strife, teenaged rebellion, and multiple affairs of his personal and family life, but on his pyschological tensions across his entire life.  It is a tribute to the writing and the acting of this program the degree to which se share that pyschological tension inside of Tony Soprano ratcheting up, ratcheing up, ratcheting up, but he never becomes so totally unattractive, or totally insane that we no longer identify or even sympathize with him.At the end of each program, so much tension, so many problems, both emotional and in the life of his crime family, are posed that I greedily want to see the next one. Monday (June 20) I watched five episodes one night, even though I started at 9 PM and  had to get up for work at 6AM!!!!Why do we do this. Don't we lead lives of tension, longing, fear of what will happen to us.  Yes, but our fears are played out at a slow, gradual, sometimes imperceptible pace, a pace where sometimes only the judgement of years of hindsight allows us to make sense of what has happened.  Even with all the angst and pain and pressure isn't it satisfying, intoxicating, and luxurious to see what happens next to Tony Soprano whether more tension, whether partial resolution, whether deeper tragedy, by simply flicking the remote and spending another hour?This year he faces the deepening of his internal conflicts by the prescence of his cousin Tony B, who in turn reminds Tony Soprano of his conflict with his mother, the most fundamental of his problems because Tony B has returned from a long time in prison after a job Tony S missed because he had the first of his panic attacks after an argument with dear old mother. Tony B creates headaches when he does free lance killings for one faction in the New York mob against another faction, while Tony S tries to keep his crew neutral.  In the end, Tony's loyalty to his cousin is expressed by Tony deciding to murder Tony B himself, rather than let the New Yorkers torture him.The weakest thing this year is the reconciliation between Tony and Carmella.  Our natural pressure is to deisre that our virtual parents, Tony and Carmella, get back together and love each other.  We're like small children who demand that their parents never part. In real life, often when the same small children become adults, we learn that our parents were completely incompatible, that they became happier people and better parents divorced, and that marriage is a thorny and problematical experience at best. This is very truly painted at the end of the 2003 series and the bulk of this 2004 series when Carmella separates from Tony and tony is forced to recognize the extent of his inability to deal with women in a decent way. It is confirmed by Tony's inappropriate and scary acting out with his mistress, and above all with his totally inappropriate behavior with his shrink, something that would have gained a total break in relations, an order of protection, or even assault charges in the real world.Yet, as the Sopranos's virtual children, we feel something good with Carmella getting back with Tony.  Perhaps that is inevitable, because what role would she have on the show if she were completely divorced? Carmella is, after Tony S, the most attractive character on the program.However, we don't really see any justified motion that takes Carmella back to Tony other than her lying to her son's counselor, who had been her lover, about going back with Tony and a sex scene in the pool after which she was more committed to divorce. We do see her being blugeoned back to Tony by her priest who is probably sexually jealous of her new lover and by Tony's compromising of all the divorce lawyers in New Jersey and the fear of dealing with him that the forensic accountants have.  This all should make Carmella more angry and afraid of her loss of freedom by being associated with Tony, not bring her back.What seems to bring Carmella back is the series's need for further confrontation between Tony and Carmella, the series's need for infighting about how Tony junior will turn out, a closer center for their bickering and fighting, and the series belief that we pathetic virtual kiddies of Tony and Carmella will accept anything as long as they are back together.We say good bye to Andriana. I say good riddance! No doubt this may be that the actress is having a baby, working in films, or has other things to do.  As far as I am concerned, her character had been painted too poorly for me to care much for her.  She seems to be incapable of intelligent decisions.  I don't think of her so much as a ""real"" person as much as I think of her as an expression of the series's writers's prejudices against lower middle class Italian-American women. Andriana was just so stupid in her relationship, her drug use, the way she conducted her business, and anything else.  The only glimmer of interest I had was when she and Tony sparked a friendship. Yet, with all of her cliched confusion, I felt Christopher didn't deserve her and, perhaps, she didn't deserve him.This is not to detract from the talent and dedication and beauty the actress who played Andriana demonstrated in her years on the Sopranos.  Moreover, maybe knowing she was going to get rubbed out the series writers didnt feel charged to write her character well.One of the more innovative aspects of this year's series is the prolonged dream sequence that really marks the end of the second act of the story. Every horror in his life, every threat from his cousin, from his wife, from his own men, from a symbolic mob of all the characters and people off the street running to get him, everything is thrown against him in another one of the series's very good dreams which remind me too much of my own.  In a sense this dream acts as a kind of Jungian descent into the underworld of his subconscious, a cleansing catharsis that allows Tony to move forward to resolutions of all the pending situations for the season: his murder of Tony B, his reconciliation with Carmella, and his finding ""peace"" with Johnnie Sack. So much that is not earned by plot development is earned by the catharsis of this dream.Yet, catharsis is the central product of the Sopranos and its glowing strength. Laden as it is by murder and violence and thuggery, by wealth, corruption, the sexual decadence of his mistresses and prostitutes and the silicone queens at the Bing to give it a more and more andrenilen edge, Tony's catharsis is what we watch the series for.I am not surprised by the reviewers who speak of sexual eruption as soon as the Aopranos are over. The tension in him is always tighter than the tension in us, even if it is so evocative of the personal time bombs we carry within us.  We feel hot, charged,electric and energized after a burst of three or four of these shows together, rather than the angst we might feel after one with a week or more to wait until we find out what happens next.  The charge here,the rush, of several episode blasted together on DVD is overwhelming.How interesting it is that a double of that dream occurs in the final sequence of the last episode. Tony goes to the estate of Johnnie Sack, the new king of the New York mob, to make peace after Tony S has murdered Tony B. At the end of a negotation when Sack finally comes to terms with Tony, hordes of FBI men in full SWAT team regalia descend on them. Even as Sack is caught, Tony flees through the woods, the brush, through a stream, through backyards until he reaches a telephone and learns the feds were after Sack and his family and not him. He returns home after trudging miles through the snow with his clothes ripped, his face bruised, and exhausted, but silent when Carmella asks, keeping all of this horror in.Well, just like Carmella's barely explainable reconciliation with Tony, Tony needs to escape the FBI so this wonderful series can go on another year.Will there be horror from a New York mob that doesnt know Sack and Tony made peace or think Tony got away for the wrong reason.  Tony Soprano bottles up an explosive morning, but does not tell Carmella anything.  Their war too can break out again.Yet, this is what we need, why we want more Sopranos, and we hope this is what they will provide for us season, after season.",5,"A great drama, great character,

Although Tony doesn't get the reference, it stands as an epigraph to Season Five and to Tony's character in general. The tensions that make Tony a lovable psychopath also, in Season Five, threaten to rip him apart: most importantly, his genuine affection for and desire to protect his family come into conflict with his duties as a crime boss.A variety of insights emerge as various characters attempt to come to grips with who Tony really is. Silvio: his besetting sin is pride; Paulie: he is a old-style general worthy of respect and admiration; Carmela: his vulnerability makes him worth loving; Dr. Melfi: he retreats from accepting responsibility to the cocoon of sentimentality. A brilliant dream sequence at the center of the series -- a kind of epiphany of Tony -- dramatizes all these features of his character.This is Tony's season, where we witness his fumbling attempts to take responsibility for his messes at the same time that we observe how easily he is tempted into rage and denial. Deeply complex, the script provides the perfect vehicle for the monumental talent of James Gandolfino. I personally prefer Season Four because it makes more space for the world of the Soprano women, but, in its anatomy of Tony himself, nothing beats Season Five.",5,Tony's Season,1151193600,"06 25, 2006",2006,1329,"['Dr.', 'Jennifer', 'Melfi', 'Yeats', 'Tony', 'center', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'Tony', ""n't"", 'get', 'reference', 'epigraph', 'Season', 'Five', 'Tony', 'character', 'general', 'tensions', 'make', 'lovable', 'psychopath', 'also', 'Season', 'Five', 'threaten', 'rip', 'apart', 'most', 'importantly', 'genuine', 'affection', 'desire', 'protect', 'family', 'come', 'conflict', 'duties', 'crime', 'boss.A', 'variety', 'insights', 'emerge', 'various', 'characters', 'attempt', 'come', 'grips', 'who', 'Tony', 'really', 'Silvio', 'besetting', 'sin', 'pride', 'Paulie', 'old-style', 'general', 'worthy', 'respect', 'admiration', 'Carmela', 'vulnerability', 'worth', 'loving', 'Dr.', 'Melfi', 'accepting', 'responsibility', 'cocoon', 'sentimentality', 'brilliant', 'dream', 'sequence', 'center', 'series', 'kind', 'epiphany', 'Tony', 'features', 'character.This', 'Tony', 'season', 'where', 'witness', 'fumbling', 'attempts', 'take', 'responsibility', 'messes', 'same', 'time', 'observe', 'how', 'easily', 'tempted', 'rage', 'denial', 'Deeply', 'complex', 'script', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'monumental', 'talent', 'James', 'Gandolfino', 'personally', 'prefer', 'Season', 'Four', 'more', 'space', 'world', 'Soprano', 'women', 'anatomy', 'Tony', 'nothing', 'beats', 'Season', 'Five']",N/A

Tony and Carmella come to a reconciliation agreement,,which most viewers will know Tony enough to know that he probably had his fingers crossed behind his back during.
