If you are a purist about myths and legends then this might disappoint you. The myth deviates early as the story line follows a brutal king and his slave queen who has just conquered ARGOS. The queen is desperate to save her people from further blood shed so she makes a pact to conceive a son and although he known as by his Greek name to the populace he is of course Hercules the son of Zeus. Who ever wrote the screen play must have had an after thought and tried to inject some part of Hercules' legend because the Nemidian Lion makes and appearance and of course Hercules kills it. Don't expect too much more where his legend is concerned because then it gets to be a little Helen of Troyish when he falls in love with the princess of Crete but must stand by while his older brother if betrothed to her. Although they run away, they are brought back and Hercules is sent on a mission that is doomed from the start. He is taken prisoner and fights his way back home in an attempt to regain his kingdom and the princess before she is married to his brother. The fight scenes are good but they pull the slow motion effects ala 300 during many of his fight scenes. Like I said if you don't know Greek Mythology and Hercules then this movie is for you if you liked 300.

If I want to see the original Hercules, I'll watch the original movie!!! Clear?!Now, for this Legend of Hercules movie, it's entertaining and it's not as horrible as some angry viewers have described. I enjoyed watching it as a new flick. Just keep your mind open, forget about the original Hercules. The 3D effects are great and fun to watch. The surround sound is also great. However, there are issues that I have with this movie, otherwise, it would have got 4 stars from me. First, the actors and actresses are not terribly bad but their acting is below average. Secondly, too many slow-mos in the movie that it got to the point of redundant and annoying. Lastly, this is a violent movie but the director chose not to have a drop of blood in the movie... that's ridiculous and unrealistic. I'm not a big fan of blood and gut movies but just imagine if you watched Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers without a drop of blood... If the director has something to against showing blood, then he should make the kid movies or chick flicks.

First, the script seemed to have been written by couple of second graders. No plots, story line or dialog worth mentioning. Second, it was terribly acted. I don&#8217;t think I can recall any movie I have ever seen where every character was just this terrible. Given the material one can understand actor&#8217;s inability to portray the character well, but I am still puzzled how not even one of them managed to do their job properly, which leads to&#8230;  Third, the worst directing job I&#8217;ve seen in a very, very long time.

In big budget blockbusters likes of which this film was trying to be, special effects are the main attraction. But in this case they were are so bad, so dated I can&#8217;t help myself but wonder if they actually spend any money making this movie? 15 years ago this could have been acceptable, maybe. But with the technology available today, this was unforgivable. To give you one example: in the beginning of the film the title character and his brother come face to face with a killer lion. And when the lion actually showed up on a screen every single person in the theater laughed. We actually laughed.

1690094,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00HLSW6TW,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[11, 16]","Hercules has always been a popular subject for movies. So after movies like ""300,"" ""Immortals"" and ""Clash of the Titans,"" it's not surprising that Hollywood would dredge him up again.Unfortunately, they cast the meathead from ""Twilight"" as Hercules.And the terrible casting is only one of the problems in ""The Legend of Hercules"" -- it feels like a cheap TV movie version of an actual blockbuster movie, with claustrophobic sets, random eruptions of slow-mo and uber-cheesy dialogue. Even worse, it cribs from the earlier Grecian myth movies while lacking even a shred of their style.Repelled by her power-hungry husband King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins), Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) makes a deal with the goddess Hera: Zeus will have sex with her, and she will have a son named Hercules who will destroy Amphitryon. Amphitryon, suspecting the baby isn't his, names him Alcides.Two decades later, Alcides/Hercules (Kellan Lutz) is in love with Princess Hebe (Gaia Weiss), but she's betrothed to his wimpy brother Iphicles (Liam Garrigan). They try and fail to run away together, and Amphitryon punishes Alcides/Hercules by sending him off on an undermanned mission.Of course, the undermanned mission gets slaughtered, except for Hercules and his buddy Captain Sotiris (Liam McIntyre), and they are quickly sold into slavery as gladiators... because yeah, they had LOTS of those in ancient Egypt. Hercules' superhuman strength allows him to free himself and Sotiris, but he must somehow seize his father's kingdom before his brother weds Hebe... or something like that.""The Legend of Hercules"" really feels like a TV movie knockoff of a blockbuster movie, or maybe a halfhearted TV pilot. It certainly doesn't feel like a movie with seventy million dollars behind it -- everything feels very cheap and lackluster, especially since they apparently have no sets larger than my living room, and the special effects are mostly confined to bad lightning flashes.Of course, director Renny Harlin doesn't help matters. After all, this is the guy who gave us movies like ""The Covenant,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 4,"" ""Cutthroat Island"" and ""Exorcist: The Beginning,"" so he directs like an amateur who has just figured out the mechanics of film.For instance, the movie has random bursts of slow-motion -- not the climactic parts of fights, but horses leaping over logs or Hercules tossing a dead body away. It's like Harlin keeps dozing off and accidentally pushing the ""slo-mo"" button.  He also rather blatantly copies the defiant-demigod-who-doesn't-believe-in-the-gods-because-they're-mean-until-he-totally-needs-their-help dynamic that was forefront in ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""Immortals,"" which comes across as hollow and simplistic.Admittedly some of the ""Gladiator""-lite action scenes are decent, but the movie falls into lurching lethargy as soon as they stop. Both fights and romantic scenes are hopelessly wooden, and the dialogue is the sort of tin-eared kitschy cheez that boggle your mind (""In my mind's eye, where your face has been etched since the first day I saw you"").And Kellan Lutz... oh, Kellan Lutz. He speaks with the charisma of a dead seal and the intensity of a constipation victim. He looks like he's straining his acting talents whenever he's forced to speak more than five words in a row, and you can practically hear the wind whistling between his ears when he tries to be righteously outraged. This role needed a Chris Hemsworth, and instead we got an Emmett Cullen.Most of the other actors are either blandly generic (Weiss), two-dimensional (Garrigan) or engaging in frothing scenery-chewing (Adkins, who seems to be channeling Nicolas Cage). The mighty and passionate goddess Hera is turned into a whining, crying wimp. The only person who gives a semi-decent performance is Liam McIntyre, who easily outshines Lutz.""The Legend of Hercules"" leaves you pining for Kevin Sorbo or longing for The Rock -- a cheap-looking, inept disaster of a film that fails in basically every way.

1690106,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00HLSW6TW,FNDNreview,"[8, 13]","There&#8217;s been no shortage of films portraying the mythological Greek hero, Hercules.  Sadly, nearly every single one of them is either embarrassing and/or outdated to the point there isn&#8217;t really a film to point at and say &#8211; that&#8217;s the best Hercules movie.  Some could make a case for the Disney animated feature from 1997, but other than that, Hercules has been best defined by Kevin Sorbo&#8217;s portrayal of the character in the television show, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.  And, if director Renny Harlin thought he was the man to reinvigorate the character in his film, The Legend of Hercules, then epic fail applies here.In The Legend of Hercules, Kellan Lutz stars as Hercules, the son of Zeus &#8211; the father of the Gods.  The film begins with the introduction of King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins), as he easily adds another kingdom to his empire.  He is a bloodthirsty man that will do anything for power, a trait that his wife, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee), finds to be revolting.  She prays to the Gods to put an end to this King&#8217;s rule so there may be peace.  Understanding what she is asking for, she is then &#8220;impregnated&#8221; by Zeus &#8211; and prepares to have a child that the king knows full well is not his own.Flash forward many years and Hercules (who goes by another name that the king picked out for him) is in the middle of a tryst with Hebe (Gaia Weiss), the daughter of a king from a neighboring rival kingdom.  However, she has already been promised to Hercules&#8217; diabolical brother, Iphicles (Liam Garrigan).  Naturally, the brothers become at odds with one another, prompting the king (who shows favoritism towards his one true son) to send Hercules off on a mission of war that is doomed to fail and lead to his death.Aware that he&#8217;s has an uphill battle to contend with, Hercules is desperate to return home before his brother marries his true love.  Along the way, he must face down an army, slavery, various battles, and eventually, his own &#8220;family&#8217;s&#8221; hatred towards him &#8211; not to mention the unexpected realization that he&#8217;s the son of the most powerful God of them all.Doesn&#8217;t that sound exciting?  To some, it might actually sound appealing.  Well, shouldn&#8217;t buy into it and don&#8217;t you dare waste a single second thinking about watching this monstrosity of a movie.  The odds are usually going to be against a film succeeding when a sub-par director, like Renny Harlin, signs on to helm the project.  After all this is the guy that&#8217;s is most notable for directing films that include A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, Driven, and 12 Rounds.  The quality of those particular films speak for themselves and provide enough information to know this Hercules film is not to be taken seriously.If the directing wasn&#8217;t bad enough, the acting doesn&#8217;t do this film any favors either.  Leading man Kellan Lutz, who some might recognize from his small supporting role in the Twilight films, might look buff and ready for action &#8211; but terrible action sequences and mediocre visual effects really kill any ability for Lutz to show his acting skill.  For reasons behind understanding, not one single role was given to a major Hollywood player &#8211; limiting the film&#8217;s advertising capabilities and general appeal to a wider audience.  It&#8217;s difficult enough for moviegoers to invest their time and money into major films (who have an above average chance these days of being terrible) with A-list actors, so apparently the people behind this film didn&#8217;t learn very much from 2011&#8217;s Conan the Barbarian debacle (which also starred an unrecognizable leading man in the lead).Unfortunately, there&#8217;s absolutely nothing (and I mean nothing) about Lutz&#8217;s character that makes you care about him.  These characters, along with Luz&#8217;s love interest, portrayed by the forgettable Gaia Weiss, are completely devoid of emotion &#8211; and if you need proof (the poor folks out there that have seen it know what I&#8217;m talking about), then look no further than the shrug-worthy villains.  Both King Amphitryon and his son, Iphicles, attempt to be grandiose, but simply appear to be just as cheesy and unbelievably annoying as the &#8220;good guys.&#8221;  Frankly, each and every one of the characters could either live, die, or become bean farmers for all I care &#8211; just as long as I never have to watch this movie ever again.  If you couldn&#8217;t already tell, this is one of those generic hero-worshiping movies where the good guy lives and the bad guys die &#8211; meaning the only question that viewers will be asking themselves is how long will it take to get through it all and to the credits?Overall, The Legend of Hercules starts out badly, gets worse, rips off Gladiator (in cliff note fashion), and eventually ends on a terrible note (featuring one of the dumbest and most mishandled endings in quite a long time).  More often than not and with every passing scene, this film is a great example of how to waste a lot of money to make a monumentally poor film.  Not only is it poor, it lacks authenticity, mind-blowing effects, and characters with heart.  However, the only thing that stops this movie from being a complete and utter failure is the appeal that it might have for young boys in the 8-year-old range.  Sure, this film is violent, but it&#8217;s actually tasteful violence that plays out just as a Saturday morning cartoon would &#8211; meaning there&#8217;s no blood, gore, or abusive language.  In fact, the three stooges might be more violent than The Legend of Hercules.  In any event, I know it&#8217;s only January, but I have a feeling this movie winds up on a lot of people&#8217;s worst films of 2014 list.GRADE:  D-FNDNreview.com",1,Brutally terrible is the ONLY way

It's not all bad. It's just not good enough.HERCULES tries to have the look and feel of the STARZ series SPARTACUS. There are mild similarities in the action and fight scenes, but they are mild and few and far between. A cable channel made a series far beyond anything seen in HERCULES.That leads us to Kellan Lutz as HERCULES. Yes, he is muscular and good-looking but can he act? There was something mechanical about Lutz as Hercules and most of the cast seemed to just be an inconsequential part of the sleepy action.For most of the movie, Hercules is just a normal human with extra muscles. Only when he finds out he is the son of the god Zeus does he realize he has a greater purpose in life. Here is a man born to a mortal woman and a god and whose destiny is to save his people from domination. Does that sound like another man we know? The comparisons to Jesus seemed fairly obvious toward the end...though our Hercules is more mortal and has a love interest.Unfortunately, THE LEGEND OF HERCULES is an all-around disappointment.",2,A FILM THAT TRIED TO BE SOMETHING THAT IT WAS NOT,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,1248,"['first', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'movie', 'Hercules', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'was', 'curious', 'enough', 'watch', 'DVD', 'people', 'THE', 'LEGEND', 'OF', 'HERCULES', 'had', 'something', 'grand', 'mind', 'failed', 'miserably', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'enough.HERCULES', 'tries', 'have', 'look', 'feel', 'STARZ', 'series', 'SPARTACUS', 'are', 'mild', 'similarities', 'action', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'mild', 'few', 'far', 'A', 'cable', 'channel', 'made', 'series', 'far', 'anything', 'seen', 'HERCULES.That', 'Kellan', 'Lutz', 'HERCULES', 'Yes', 'muscular', 'good-looking', 'can', 'act', 'was', 'something', 'mechanical', 'about', 'Lutz', 'Hercules', 'most', 'cast', 'seemed', 'just', 'be', 'inconsequential', 'part', 'sleepy', 'most', 'movie', 'Hercules', 'just', 'normal', 'human', 'extra', 'muscles', 'Only', 'when', 'out', 'son', 'god', 'Zeus', 'realize', 'greater', 'purpose', 'life', 'Here', 'man', 'born', 'mortal', 'woman', 'god', 'destiny', 'save', 'people', 'domination', 'sound', 'man', 'know', 'comparisons', 'Jesus', 'seemed', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'end', 'Hercules', 'more', 'mortal', 'love', 'interest.Unfortunately', 'THE', 'LEGEND', 'OF', 'HERCULES', 'all-around', 'disappointment']",N/A

Unfortunately this isnot one of them.  And the title is wrong: his name is HERACLES, not Hercules; Hercules is the god-mans Roman name.  Anyhow,there is no legend in this film except as to how Herk was born.  Zeus indeed is his father though Hera was not too pleased with hisfooling around with the Greek chickeepoos, but hey, when you are MR BIG or the BOSS. who is going to argue with you.The sets are quite good including the Lions Gate, Photography good, the architecture faithful for the time period, and the costumesaccurate though the Greek men did not wear Togas.  The cast is ok though I did not think the princess was very pretty; Herks brotherwas cuter and I am not gay.  The original tales of Herk was not present in the film and the story seemed to be based more onGLADIATOR than the classic myths.  And the Greeks did not like or engage in gladiatorial games like the Romans until late inthe 3rd Century AD. They did however engage in some very rough sporting games, such as boxing with hard leather gloves.Still, the film is kind of fun, but I did not like the slow motion inserts. like when Herk was swinging those paper mache bouldersall over the place. I only gave it two stars because of the weak story; the cheap Steve Reeves films had better stories.  I liked theman who played Herk; he certainly looked &#34;Herky&#34;.  And the Special Effects were effective.  Though the battles seemed to beinspired by &#34;300&#34; style of direction, the noticeable lack of blood suggests this film was being geared more for the youth thanthe adults.

1690139,A1CT3VC2YHL2NC,B00HLSW6TW,John J. Schauer,"[0, 1]","Based On all the negative reviews posted here, I originally was not going to order &#8220;The Legend of Hercules,&#8221; but then thought better of it for two reasons: 1) Amazon offered it at a great sale price; and 2) some of the reviewers complained that it didn&#8217;t show enough gore or blood in the battle scenes, which is, to my way of thinking, a plus and not a minus. So I ordered it.I&#8217;m glad I did. I found it to be a fun adventure film in the mold of the old Italian fusto films, but with much higher production values. If you are expecting a great piece of film art, you are of course going to be disappointed. If you just want a fun sword-and-sandals pic, it does just fine.First off, the film is visually stunning. I don&#8217;t know why others were complaining about &#8220;claustrophobic&#8221; sets, but the visual elements of this movie are quite impressive, the sets, costumes and CGI effects (although I find it amusing that a generation is growing up thinking that CGI is more &#8220;realistic&#8221; looking than older film effects, when in fact CGI merely looks like CGI). I only saw the DVD in 2-D, but I get the impression that, if it was executed well, it would be quite a knockout in 3-D.Other reviewers are correct that the sudden lurching into slow motion is painfully overdone. It is one thing to highlight a particular moment&#8212;say, the death blow to an important character&#8212;through the use of slow motion, but it happens so frequently and arbitrarily throughout the film you get the feeling someone was sitting with their hand on the slow-mo button and just would switch it on at random, with no consideration whatsoever of what was being shown. And during the final battle sequence, it gets absolutely ridiculous. Another minor gripe: the teeth of the hero are made to appear so white that even when his face is in shadow, his teeth look like glowing neon Chicklets.Unlike others, I don&#8217;t see the acting as being so much &#8220;wooden&#8221; as in an intentionally archaic and pompous tone common to many films set in ancient times; certainly it is preferable to the more &#8220;naturalistic&#8221; acting of the Kevin Sorbo television series, which intentionally made the characters sound like modern-day Southern Californians. Is the acting worthy to be compared to the great performances of Laurence Oliver, Marlon Brando or Robert de Niro? Of course not. Is it any worse than the acting of former fusto actors Alan Steel, Reg Park, Mark Forest, Lou Ferrigno or even the most iconic of all Hercules actors, Steve Reeves? No. Is the plot (which admittedly is a nonsensical jumble of elements of the real Hercules myths and total fabrications the writers pulled out of their butts) any more absurd than the plots of &#8220;Hercules Against the Moon Men,&#8221; &#8220;Son of Samson,&#8221; or &#8220;Medusa Versus the Son of Hercules&#8221;? Hardly. And the visuals are head, shoulders and pecs above any of those antecedents.So if you are a fan of the old muscleman films of a day gone by, you&#8217;ll have a good time watching this.

There are a few impressive scenes that were clearly designed for 3D in your face. But the overall story is very pedestrian in its ambitions and proceedings, as the movie plays in an unremarkable and familiar cliche of a wronged man's quest for vengeance and justice.The lead is somewhat wooden, and his clean-shaven face and short haircut does not fit the role well either, as he resembles more of a Roman politician than a rugged Greek warrior.

So let me start with the positive...Kellan Lutz is attractive, hot even...but that's it. I wanted to think, when I selected this video, that a hot guy and the age old story of Hercules would be enough to carry this movie or at the very least make it decent. But sadly, I was wrong. Lutz was attractive and sympathetic, but there was nothing else to capture the attention of the audience. The graphics were mediocre and the plot a little redundant. In a nutshell....there is an obnoxious King who shuns his younger son (Hercules) because he believes that he isn't his father (which of course is true, he is the son of Zeus). The King is callous and mean to Hercules at every turn and instead showers his greedy/treacherous/sniveling older son (Hercules' brother) with attention and even supports his attempts to woe Hercule's love interest, the lovely princess. There are several twists and turns in the story that includes betrayal and treachery, peppered with a few love scenes...but other than that, it all fell a little flat. Would I recommend this movie? Well, this would have been the perfect movie for the Sci Fi station (it was even a little campy).

This is surely the most misnamed movie of the year. It has absolutely nothing to do with the real Hercules myths.2. This is basically just another generic gladiator movie, except the names of the characters are taken from Greek mythology. You&#8217;ve seen this movie before. Multiple times.3. It&#8217;s about a power-hungry, violent king named Amphitryon who takes lands just for the gold and the work he can get out of the people. His wife, Alcmene, thinks he&#8217;s pretty much a worthless dick. She makes a pact with the goddess Hera to have sex with her husband, the king of gods, Zeus. She wants a son to take out Amphitryon. Hera agrees to help Alcmene, and says the boy Hercules will be the savior of the people.(In the real story, Zeus just takes Alcmene because he wants to, and Hera hates Hercules so much that she tries to kill him and makes his entire life miserable).4. Hercules is born, and falls in love his brother&#8217;s girlfriend, Hebe, so he is sent to die on the battlefield. He survives, is sold into slavery, and becomes a gladiator. He tries to get back to Hebe before she marries his brother. Blah blah blah.5. Hercules spends all but about 10 minutes of the movie being just a regular man. He doesn&#8217;t believe his mother when she tells him he&#8217;s the son of Zeus. It&#8217;s not until he is in trouble and cries to Zeus for help that he gets a burst of extra strength. Then he just throws boulders around or whips people with lightning for a minute.6. The fight scenes are a straight rip-off of &#8220;300&#8221;. I admit they are cool to watch - as long as you aren&#8217;t tired of the slow motion pecs-and-swords thing.7. A lot of the special effects seemed kind of cheap. Even Zeus, who could have been badass, is... invisible. Seriously. The scene where Zeus impregnates Alcmene is just Alcmene moving her arms and legs while the bed sheets swirl around.8. You can tell a scene is dramatic because there&#8217;s either a lightning storm, or else weird snowflakes float through the air, even when it&#8217;s warm outside.9. If they made the movie about the real legend of Hercules, This could have been something.

Does it have a story of some kind that is understandable with interesting characters? Done. Is it great? That depends on what you compare it to. Honestly, the story could use refinement, but this movie is about the action first.3. Some scenes showing Hercules' trademark strength? Yes. Just watch the final act and a lot of the fights.If you can look past the simple, familiar plot and just enjoy the action, this movie is worth a look. The 3D effects are outstanding with lots of stuff popping out and a cool sense of depth.Action Scenes:Intro Sword Fight and War.Fight against a (comical Computerized) Lion.Fight against a small army of archers in a cave.Fight in a big arena with a pit with rocks and two fighters (Hercules and Spartacus) against some bad guys.Fight against 6 warriors versus Hercules.

Those are mere child&#8217;s play compared to the labor of sitting through the Legend of Hercules.  Lou Ferrigno can now breathe easy in the knowledge that he is no longer the star of the worst Hercules movie ever made.  Considering films like this, the Clash of the Titans remake and its sequel, and the 2011 film &#8220;Immortals&#8221;, the Greek people may regret ever recording their mythology.Queen Alcmene, wife of the tyrant King Amphitryon (Adkins) prays to the Goddess Hera for aid.  Hera appears to her and tells her she will bear the son of Zeus and he will be the savior of her people.  Cut ahead 20 years later and Hercules (Lutz), named Alcides by the King who knows he is not his son, is now a young, powerful man.  His older brother Iphicles constantly berates him and even takes full credit for killing the Nemean Lion in a CGI created sequence that makes the average Syfy network film seem cutting edge by comparison.Hercules and Iphicles are both in love with the same woman so his father gets rid of the competition by sending Hercules off to a military campaign in Egypt.  Hercules is joined by his friend, Captain Sotiris (Liam McIntyre of Spartacus).  Their troops are ambushed leaving only Hercules and Sotiris alive as they are captured by Tarak (Schaech) leader of the Hoplites.  Tarak sells the pair into slavery where they are forced to fight for their lives in the gladiatorial arena.  The pair wins their freedom and return home where Hercules must finally embrace his true lineage as the son of Zeus to gain his full powers to defeat the army of his father.For star Kellen Lutz, he must likely be thinking he never wants to hear anything about Greek Mythology again as he has the misfortune of not only starring in this film, but also in Immortals.  Lutz at least looks the role but that&#8217;s never been much of an issue with Hercules films, even going back to the Italian-made sword and sandal epics of the 1960s.  Lutz finds himself lost when he has to carry the action himself.  Fortunately McIntyre helps him out a good deal although I am sure he wishes he had retired his sword after Spartacus ended.  And for the record, Hoplites were NOT Egyptian soldiers but another faction of Greek soldiers but I hardly think historical accuracy entered the equation at any point during this film.Despite the many battles in the film its PG-13 rating renders it nearly bloodless to the point of absurdity.  The gladiatorial fights are particularly tame and thus laughable despite Director Renny Harlin&#8217;s over usage of the &#8220;300&#8221; style of super slow-motion action.  One wonders where the $70 million budget went as the visual effects and cinematography are equally horrible.  Four different people are credited with writing the film and you can only assume that they did so independently without seeing what any of the others wrote due the disjointed narrative.For Harlin, who once upon a time made a couple of decent films (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, Deep Blue Sea) it is another low point in his career which seemed like it could get no worse after the horrible &#8220;Exorcist: The Beginning&#8221; in 2004.",1,Lou Ferrigno can now breathe easy in the knowledge that he is no longer the ...,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,3277,"['Slaying', 'Lernaean', 'Hydra', 'Cleaning', 'Augean', 'Stables', 'Capturing', 'Cerberus', 'three-headed', 'guardian', 'underworld', 'are', 'mere', 'child', '8217', 'play', 'compared', 'labor', 'sitting', 'Legend', 'Hercules', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'can', 'now', 'breathe', 'easy', 'knowledge', 'no', 'longer', 'star', 'worst', 'Hercules', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Considering', 'films', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'remake', 'sequel', '2011', 'film', '8220', 'Immortals', '8221', 'Greek', 'people', 'may', 'regret', 'ever', 'recording', 'mythology.Queen', 'Alcmene', 'wife', 'tyrant', 'King', 'Amphitryon', 'Adkins', 'Goddess', 'Hera', 'aid', 'Hera', 'will', 'bear', 'son', 'Zeus', 'will', 'be', 'savior', 'people', 'Cut', 'ahead', '20', 'years', 'later', 'Hercules', 'Lutz', 'named', 'Alcides', 'King', 'who', 'not', 'son', 'now', 'young', 'powerful', 'man', 'older', 'brother', 'Iphicles', 'constantly', 'even', 'full', 'credit', 'killing', 'Nemean', 'Lion', 'CGI', 'created', 'sequence', 'average', 'Syfy', 'network', 'film', 'seem', 'cutting', 'edge', 'comparison.Hercules', 'Iphicles', 'are', 'love', 'same', 'woman', 'father', 'rid', 'competition', 'sending', 'Hercules', 'military', 'campaign', 'Egypt', 'Hercules', 'joined', 'friend', 'Captain', 'Sotiris', 'Liam', 'McIntyre', 'Spartacus', 'troops', 'are', 'ambushed', 'leaving', 'only', 'Hercules', 'Sotiris', 'alive', 'are', 'captured', 'Tarak', 'Schaech', 'leader', 'Hoplites', 'Tarak', 'pair', 'slavery', 'where', 'are', 'forced', 'fight', 'lives', 'gladiatorial', 'arena', 'pair', 'freedom', 'return', 'home', 'where', 'Hercules', 'must', 'finally', 'embrace', 'true', 'lineage', 'son', 'Zeus', 'gain', 'full', 'powers', 'defeat', 'army', 'father.For', 'star', 'Kellen', 'Lutz', 'must', 'likely', 'be', 'thinking', 'never', 'hear', 'anything', 'Greek', 'Mythology', 'again', 'misfortune', 'not', 'only', 'starring', 'film', 'also', 'Immortals', 'Lutz', 'least', 'role', '8217', 's', 'never', 'been', 'much', 'issue', 'Hercules', 'films', 'even', 'going', 'back', 'Italian-made', 'sword', 'sandal', 'epics', '1960s', 'Lutz', 'lost', 'when', 'carry', 'action', 'Fortunately', 'McIntyre', 'out', 'good', 'deal', 'am', 'sure', 'had', 'retired', 'sword', 'Spartacus', 'ended', 'record', 'Hoplites', 'were', 'NOT', 'Egyptian', 'soldiers', 'faction', 'Greek', 'soldiers', 'hardly', 'think', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'entered', 'equation', 'point', 'many', 'battles', 'film', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'renders', 'nearly', 'bloodless', 'point', 'absurdity', 'gladiatorial', 'fights', 'are', 'particularly', 'tame', 'thus', 'laughable', 'Director', 'Renny', 'Harlin', '8217', 's', 'usage', '8220', '300', '8221', 'style', 'super', 'slow-motion', 'action', 'One', 'where', '70', 'million', 'budget', 'went', 'visual', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'are', 'equally', 'horrible', 'Four', 'different', 'people', 'are', 'credited', 'writing', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'did', 'so', 'independently', 'seeing', 'what', 'others', 'wrote', 'due', 'disjointed', 'narrative.For', 'Harlin', 'who', 'once', 'time', 'made', 'couple', 'decent', 'films', 'Die', 'Hard', '2', 'Cliffhanger', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'low', 'point', 'career', 'seemed', 'could', 'get', 'worse', 'horrible', '8220', 'Exorcist', 'Beginning', '8221', '2004']",N/A

1690219,A3S7REHVBOSTLR,B00HLSW6TW,Toni V. Sweeney,"[0, 0]","This is the most chaste sex-and-sand (that's what they used to be called) movie I've seen lately.  In fact, there's only one scene in which two people get together and they're both fully covered by sheets. These Greeks even swim fin their chitons.  There's a general re-working of the Hercules story of course because the actual legend was full of sex. It seemed all the mighty Herc did when he wasn't killing someone or something was grab the closest woman and ravage her so this story  has been greatly sanitized. In this version Queen Alcmene agrees to have Zeus' child to free her people from her husband Amphytrion's tyranny. (Like Zeus needed his wife's permission...although supposedly Alcmene was the last human female Zeus ever coupled with, which may mean something.) In the original story, he wanted Alcmene. She repulsed his advances so he took on her husband's form (a la Uther Pendragon in the King Arthur legend) and stopped the sun in the sky so the night he spent with her actually became three nights (whew!) Alcmene names her son Hercules in an attempt to placate Hera, even though it wasn't her fault but it doesn't work because almost everything happening to the child is caused by the vengeful goddess-wife.  Not in this version. Now Hera's working with the other woman.Anyway, Hercules is born and we jump ahead twenty years to the expected sibling rivalry. Hercules loves Hebe who's betrothed to his half-brother Iphicles so of course he has to be gotten out of the way by being sent to Africa with a poorly manned outfit to be dispatched by hired assassins. But is he...?  Of course not!  He, with the single survivor, makes his way back home for VENGEANCE.There is a singular lack of special effects in this one and very little &#34;godly&#34; ones.  Zeus appears only as a whirlwind, which, according to some of his other manifestations as a bull and a shower of gold, is pretty tame. Having him appear as another Amphytrion would've been much better (and they wouldn't have had to hire a second actor for the part). There's a Samson-lookalike scene with Hercules tied between two temple pillars which immediately set up the idea he's going to pull them down. (He does.) Every fight scene is a done deal.  SIx...twelve...no matter how many men they throw at him, he takes them on single-handed and wins...with slo-mo stop-motion effect...and he made it look so easy. No worry at all there.All in all, it's a good movie. It just isn't what one expects from a movie about the greatest of the demi-gods, the superhero to end all superheroes. Granted, this is about &#34;young&#34; Hercules before he has his &#34;Labors&#34; and all the other really dramatic stuff but the absence of the gods and the reworking of the story into a cliche leaves much to be desired.  Go into it expecting a nice little fairytale and you'll be OK. I'm giving it four stars because I did like it though it was a lackluster.

Or the picture might suffer from the fact that there's no one in it..there are no &#34;stars&#34;. Hercules is played by a man who just doesn't look the part. Oh, he's big and he's got muscles, the only problem is every time you see him, instead  of seeing Hercules, you see a kid from Boston who &#34;woke up&#34; and found himself in Iraq fighting as a Marine...he might even make a good CEO in some wall street movie, but he just doesn't look like a Greek hero. In fact not too many people look like they belong in this movie...it's completely miscast.
