Too bad it is not on DVD but at least I can replace my homemade version with a pre-recorded video. Yes, the cockney accent is a bit different from the way she spoke on Murder, She Wrote, but charwomen were not portrayed as cultured. The story opens with Ada Harris (Angela Landsbury) seeing a Dior dress at one of her employers' homes and decides to do what it rakes to save up for one of her own. She walks instead of taking the bus, stops playing the numbers, or having a bit of gin and adding up her pennies. She finds a bracelet and is lucky to get the reward which gives her enough for her dress and off to Paris she goes. When she gers into the House of Dior by the back door, she is astonished to find she cannot just buy a dress, but has to attend a showing. Afterwards, the dress has to be made for her. Not able to afford lodging, she is taken in by the accountant, and when she offers to clean his flat, a lovely, young model actually helps her, and so begins a bit of matchmaking between the model and the accountant. At the showing is where Mrs. Harris meets a man who lets her call him Hippo, played by Omar Sharif, a big reason why I watched the movie, too. He has a sad tale in that he is unable to see his own granddaughter because he and his daughter are estranged from each other. When Mrs. Harris steps in and talks to his daughter, she lets her know her father waits outside the school yard every day to catch a glimpse of his granddaughter, and would she set aside her differences and let him see the child? As the fittings go on, behind the back of the director of the House of Dior who absoutely does not want ""that charwoman"" to wear a Dior dress, Madam Colbert, played so well by Diana Riggs of The Averngers fame, has her own troubles in that her late husband's actions in the war should have earned him a medal but France showed no sign of seeing that it was awarded posthumously, thus denying her the small stipend she would get, until Ada turns to Hippo for help. He also steps in to set the director straight on how to treat Ada by bringing in his friend Christian Dior himself. In the end, there is a final hurdle Hippo takes care of and Ada returns to Paris with her Dior dress and a tale her friend Vi Butterfield does not believe. A wonderful, if a bit on the Pollyanna side, movie, but in my opinion the only thing to fault this movie on is that it is not released on DVD. Other than that, it is a perfect 10.",5,A Hidden Gem,1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,2577,"['have', 'idea', 'how', 'long', 'ago', 'first', 'saw', 'how', 'do', 'have', 'taped', 'television', 'channel', 'have', 'loved', 'years', 'Too', 'bad', 'not', 'DVD', 'least', 'can', 'replace', 'homemade', 'version', 'pre-recorded', 'video', 'Yes', 'cockney', 'accent', 'bit', 'different', 'way', 'spoke', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'charwomen', 'were', 'not', 'portrayed', 'cultured', 'story', 'Ada', 'Harris', 'Angela', 'Landsbury', 'seeing', 'Dior', 'dress', 'one', 'employers', 'homes', 'decides', 'do', 'what', 'save', 'up', 'one', 'own', 'instead', 'taking', 'bus', 'playing', 'numbers', 'having', 'bit', 'gin', 'adding', 'up', 'pennies', 'bracelet', 'lucky', 'get', 'reward', 'enough', 'dress', 'Paris', 'When', 'House', 'Dior', 'back', 'door', 'astonished', 'find', 'can', 'not', 'just', 'buy', 'dress', 'attend', 'showing', 'Afterwards', 'dress', 'be', 'made', 'Not', 'able', 'afford', 'lodging', 'taken', 'accountant', 'when', 'clean', 'flat', 'lovely', 'young', 'model', 'actually', 'so', 'bit', 'matchmaking', 'model', 'accountant', 'showing', 'where', 'Mrs.', 'Harris', 'man', 'who', 'call', 'Hippo', 'played', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'big', 'reason', 'why', 'watched', 'movie', 'too', 'sad', 'tale', 'unable', 'see', 'own', 'granddaughter', 'daughter', 'are', 'estranged', 'other', 'When', 'Mrs.', 'Harris', 'steps', 'talks', 'daughter', 'know', 'father', 'waits', 'school', 'yard', 'day', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'granddaughter', 'would', 'set', 'aside', 'differences', 'let', 'see', 'child', 'fittings', 'go', 'back', 'director', 'House', 'Dior', 'who', 'absoutely', 'not', 'want', 'charwoman', 'wear', 'Dior', 'dress', 'Madam', 'Colbert', 'played', 'so', 'well', 'Diana', 'Riggs', 'Averngers', 'fame', 'own', 'troubles', 'late', 'husband', 'actions', 'war', 'should', 'have', 'earned', 'medal', 'France', 'showed', 'sign', 'seeing', 'was', 'awarded', 'posthumously', 'thus', 'denying', 'small', 'stipend', 'would', 'get', 'Ada', 'Hippo', 'help', 'also', 'set', 'director', 'straight', 'how', 'treat', 'Ada', 'bringing', 'friend', 'Christian', 'Dior', 'end', 'final', 'hurdle', 'Hippo', 'care', 'Ada', 'returns', 'Paris', 'Dior', 'dress', 'tale', 'friend', 'Vi', 'Butterfield', 'not', 'believe', 'wonderful', 'bit', 'Pollyanna', 'side', 'movie', 'opinion', 'only', 'thing', 'fault', 'movie', 'not', 'released', 'DVD', 'Other', 'perfect', '10']",Mrs. Arris Goes to Paris VHS

404852,A3IXC749UVCXWF,6304160437,Sabrina M. Messenger,"[2, 2]","It is my opinion that ""Mrs. 'Arris goes to Paris"" is a movie that should've gotten a lot more attention that it had. From what I've read in the past, it was a movie that was nearly not made at all. Most of the major studios had turned down the idea of making this 1953 Paul Gallico novel into a movie, but Ms. Lansbury believed in the story so much that she put a considerable amount of her own money and influence behind getting it produced! Now that's what I call passion for the arts...too bad more in the Industry aren't doing that!I can remember reading book when I was in my 20s, and I thought it was a very nice light read, so I was just thrilled to see the movie when it aired in 1992, and even happier when I was able to purchase the VHS a few years ago. Now I wish they'd put it on DVD so that others may enjoy this story, too. Sure some of it does seem somewhat dated as it is set in the early 1950s in France, but still I feel that the universal themes and values portrayed in this movie are still relevant...and I think that many of us can still identify with Mrs. 'Arris feelings. This is the perfect story of what can happen when one sets their mind to achieving a seemingly improbable goal, and then works hard to make that goal a reality despite setbacks and naysayers.Angela Lansbury is a fine actress in the role of Mrs. 'Arris, and I especially enjoyed the role that Diana Rigg played as the vendeuse of the House of Dior. Omar Sharif was very charming in his role of the Marquis de Chassange, and I loved the mini-love story with the accountant and the model, played by Lothaire Bluteau and Tamara Gorski.One caveat: if you purchase this movie be very careful because there are two versions of the same video: there is a shorter version (approx. 88 minutes) that is put out by an outfit called ""Family Values Video"" and it does a lot of censoring of the parts they consider not family friendly. Mind you, there is no sex, violence or profanity in the whole of the original movie, but the FVV people still found stuff to criticize and excise such as the part showing Mrs. 'Arris her friend Mrs. Butterfield in a pub filling out a football pool, and a part where Mrs. Arris shows a bit of cultural shock upon seeing a man exiting the public restroom in Paris zipping himself in public! Well, to me taking those parts out and other pretty much pretty much takes away the parts of the movie that makes it funny, and helps you to understand the charm of the story.The uncut version is about 110 minutes...and is worth watching every second.",5,Underrated and delightful movie!,1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,2556,"['opinion', 'Mrs.', ""'Arris"", 'Paris', 'movie', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'lot', 'more', 'attention', 'had', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'past', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'nearly', 'not', 'made', 'Most', 'major', 'studios', 'had', 'turned', 'down', 'idea', 'making', '1953', 'Paul', 'Gallico', 'novel', 'movie', 'Ms.', 'Lansbury', 'believed', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'put', 'considerable', 'amount', 'own', 'money', 'influence', 'getting', 'produced', 'Now', 'what', 'call', 'passion', 'arts', 'too', 'bad', 'more', 'Industry', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', 'can', 'remember', 'reading', 'book', 'when', 'was', '20s', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'light', 'read', 'was', 'just', 'thrilled', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'aired', '1992', 'even', 'happier', 'when', 'was', 'able', 'purchase', 'VHS', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', 'wish', ""'d"", 'put', 'DVD', 'others', 'may', 'enjoy', 'story', 'too', 'Sure', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'set', 'early', '1950s', 'France', 'still', 'feel', 'universal', 'themes', 'values', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'are', 'still', 'relevant', 'think', 'many', 'can', 'still', 'identify', 'Mrs.', 'feelings', 'perfect', 'story', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'one', 'mind', 'achieving', 'seemingly', 'improbable', 'goal', 'then', 'hard', 'make', 'goal', 'reality', 'setbacks', 'naysayers.Angela', 'Lansbury', 'fine', 'actress', 'role', 'Mrs.', ""'Arris"", 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'role', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'played', 'vendeuse', 'House', 'Dior', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'was', 'very', 'charming', 'role', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Chassange', 'loved', 'mini-love', 'story', 'accountant', 'model', 'played', 'Lothaire', 'Bluteau', 'Tamara', 'Gorski.One', 'caveat', 'purchase', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'are', 'two', 'versions', 'same', 'video', 'shorter', 'version', 'approx', '88', 'minutes', 'put', 'out', 'outfit', 'called', 'Family', 'Video', 'lot', 'censoring', 'parts', 'consider', 'not', 'family', 'friendly', 'Mind', 'sex', 'violence', 'profanity', 'whole', 'original', 'movie', 'FVV', 'people', 'still', 'found', 'stuff', 'criticize', 'excise', 'such', 'part', 'showing', 'Mrs.', ""'Arris"", 'friend', 'Mrs.', 'Butterfield', 'pub', 'filling', 'out', 'football', 'pool', 'part', 'where', 'Mrs.', 'Arris', 'bit', 'cultural', 'shock', 'seeing', 'man', 'exiting', 'public', 'restroom', 'Paris', 'zipping', 'public', 'Well', 'taking', 'parts', 'out', 'other', 'pretty', 'much', 'pretty', 'much', 'away', 'parts', 'movie', 'funny', 'understand', 'charm', 'story.The', 'uncut', 'version', '110', 'minutes', 'worth', 'watching', 'second']",Mrs. Arris Goes to Paris VHS
