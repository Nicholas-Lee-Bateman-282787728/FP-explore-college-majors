773884,AA7W0CFRXF46L,B0000C89IU,elfdart,"[0, 0]","the second season of Road to Avonlea is just as lively and full of character and spunk as the first one. the first season ended with sarah deciding to stay in avonlea with her family instead of returning to Montreal with her father, and the second season takes up where the first left off. this season focuses on allowing the audience to acquaint themselves with the residents of avonlea, instead of using the people of avonlea to develop sarah's character, which is what i felt the first season did more. in many of the episodes sarah doesn't play an inciting role as she did in the first season, she's just more along for the ride here, which unfortunately forshadows future seasons. i personally most enjoy the episodes that focus on the king family, and while i value and enjoy the time given to going into the lives of some of the other town members, i wanted the story to focus more on the king children/ adults. i loved marilla and rachel in anne of green gables, i already know who they are and have watched the anne movies enough times over to have familiarized myself with their personalities and dynamic. seeing them in road to avonlea is nice and provides familiarity, but i find that i don't really enjoy the episodes focused on them as i do when they're just side characters as i already know who they are.but the focus on other people provides the viewers with an outside perspective of the king family. this is one of the reasons this show is so rich and intricately woven. the story isn't told from just one perspective, but from many perspectives. so one minute we are seeing from the perspective of one person, and the next from another who shows us a different perspective on the first person. so for example, if we were to see from hetty king's perspective, we would see her pride and sense of honour and need to do what's right, but from say, rachel lynd's perspective, or many of the other town's people, even sarah sometimes, hetty is stubborn and heartless and cares only for the king name. so we get two sides of the story.this is as good, if not better than the first season as the children are a bit older, and therefore a bit better at acting, and the chatacters and story are fleshed out a bit more. great continuation",5,great,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,2248,"['second', 'season', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'just', 'lively', 'full', 'character', 'spunk', 'first', 'one', 'first', 'season', 'ended', 'sarah', 'deciding', 'stay', 'avonlea', 'family', 'instead', 'returning', 'Montreal', 'father', 'second', 'season', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'left', 'off', 'season', 'allowing', 'audience', 'acquaint', 'residents', 'avonlea', 'instead', 'using', 'people', 'avonlea', 'develop', 'sarah', 'character', 'what', 'i', 'felt', 'first', 'season', 'did', 'more', 'many', 'episodes', 'sarah', ""n't"", 'play', 'inciting', 'role', 'did', 'first', 'season', 'just', 'more', 'along', 'ride', 'here', 'unfortunately', 'future', 'seasons', 'i', 'personally', 'most', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'focus', 'king', 'family', 'i', 'value', 'enjoy', 'time', 'given', 'going', 'lives', 'other', 'town', 'members', 'i', 'wanted', 'story', 'focus', 'more', 'king', 'children/', 'adults', 'i', 'loved', 'marilla', 'rachel', 'anne', 'green', 'gables', 'i', 'already', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'have', 'watched', 'anne', 'movies', 'enough', 'times', 'have', 'familiarized', 'personalities', 'dynamic', 'seeing', 'road', 'avonlea', 'nice', 'familiarity', 'i', 'find', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'focused', 'i', 'do', 'when', ""'re"", 'just', 'side', 'characters', 'i', 'already', 'know', 'who', 'are.but', 'focus', 'other', 'people', 'viewers', 'outside', 'perspective', 'king', 'family', 'one', 'reasons', 'show', 'so', 'rich', 'intricately', 'woven', 'story', ""n't"", 'told', 'just', 'one', 'perspective', 'many', 'perspectives', 'so', 'one', 'minute', 'are', 'seeing', 'perspective', 'one', 'person', 'next', 'who', 'different', 'perspective', 'first', 'person', 'so', 'example', 'were', 'see', 'hetty', 'king', 'perspective', 'would', 'see', 'pride', 'sense', 'honour', 'need', 'do', 'what', ""'s"", 'right', 'say', 'rachel', 'lynd', 'perspective', 'many', 'other', 'town', 'people', 'even', 'sarah', 'sometimes', 'hetty', 'stubborn', 'heartless', 'only', 'king', 'name', 'get', 'two', 'sides', 'story.this', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'children', 'are', 'bit', 'older', 'therefore', 'bit', 'better', 'acting', 'chatacters', 'story', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'great', 'continuation']",N/A

I then remembered my Grandma watching a show called Avonlea when I was a kid, I never sat down and watched it with her...but after seeing the Anne movies I had to give them a try. When I saw how much they were I decided to rent some first. We rented season 1 and 2 and my kids (2, 4, and 6 at the time) and I loved them! I love all the RTA seasons even more than Little House. We own all but one of the seasons now...but we will get it next month! I watch these over and over with my kids, my five year old son even loves them. He thinks Felix and Gus are so cool! I would say from a conservative Christian perspective that there were a few episodes (out of all the seasons combined not out of each one) that I wont show my young children until they are older. I just put a sticky note on the outside of the case to remind myself which one I don't want them to watch. Some episodes in this series the children are quite naughty, but it makes for good discussions with my children afterwards. Sometimes Amazon's price is good...sometimes not. Season 4 I bought from Amazon but Season 3 I found a better deal on ebay..

773893,A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,B0000C89IU,octobercountry,"[8, 8]","Looking through the Amazon listings for the ""Road to Avonlea"" series can be a little confusing, if you're trying to figure out exactly which edition of the series you're getting.The programme is slowly being re-released on DVD by the Sullivan company in a new edition described as a ""widescreen hi-def digital restoration.""  Well, that's all to the good, but please keep in mind that these are NOT high-definition Blu-ray releases.  They are standard DVDs which will play on any DVD machine.  I think it's extremely misleading to use the term ""HI-DEF"" in the promotional material.That said, these new releases are vastly superior to the old DVD sets, which had terrible quality-control issues and generally looked dreadful, with picture quality so grainy that the episodes looked like they were shot through a screen door.  The new transfers are very clean and sharp, and presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio---fitting the screen width of modern widescreen televisions.  Now, the series was shot on 35 mm film stock, which has an aspect ratio of 1.33:1.  So, these new releases do re-frame the picture slightly, cropping a bit off the top and bottom of the film frame.  However, I've done frame-to-frame comparisons of the old and new transfers, and I see that while there is a little cropping at the top and bottom, at the same time on the new version there is a little more picture visible on each side of the frame (which had been cropped off in the original release).  So, it's a bit of a trade-off in terms of how much of the picture you're getting, when comparing the old and new versions.  But the quality of the new transfers is so extremely superior to the old, I can't say I mind missing that tiny bit of picture from the upper and lower portions of the screen at all.A quick way to tell which edition of the series you're buying, is to look at the covers.  The new transfers have a wide bar of solid colour running across the top of the DVD case, with ""Road to Avonlea"" printed in large capital letters.  As of this writing (December 2010), the first three seasons have been re-released in this new format, and I do hope the remaining seasons will follow, as this is an EXCELLENT series!",5,Technical note,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,2196,"['Looking', 'Amazon', 'listings', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'confusing', ""'re"", 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'edition', 'series', ""'re"", 'getting.The', 'programme', 'slowly', 'being', 're-released', 'DVD', 'Sullivan', 'company', 'new', 'edition', 'described', 'widescreen', 'hi-def', 'digital', 'restoration', 'Well', 'good', 'please', 'keep', 'mind', 'are', 'NOT', 'high-definition', 'Blu-ray', 'releases', 'are', 'standard', 'DVDs', 'will', 'play', 'DVD', 'machine', 'think', 'extremely', 'misleading', 'use', 'term', 'HI-DEF', 'promotional', 'material.That', 'said', 'new', 'releases', 'are', 'vastly', 'superior', 'old', 'DVD', 'sets', 'had', 'terrible', 'quality-control', 'issues', 'generally', 'looked', 'dreadful', 'picture', 'quality', 'so', 'grainy', 'episodes', 'looked', 'were', 'shot', 'screen', 'door', 'new', 'transfers', 'are', 'very', 'clean', 'sharp', 'presented', '1.78:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', '-fitting', 'screen', 'width', 'modern', 'widescreen', 'televisions', 'Now', 'series', 'was', 'shot', '35', 'mm', 'film', 'stock', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.33:1', 'So', 'new', 'releases', 'do', 're-frame', 'picture', 'slightly', 'cropping', 'bit', 'top', 'bottom', 'film', 'frame', 'However', ""'ve"", 'done', 'frame-to-frame', 'comparisons', 'old', 'new', 'transfers', 'see', 'little', 'cropping', 'top', 'bottom', 'same', 'time', 'new', 'version', 'little', 'more', 'picture', 'visible', 'side', 'frame', 'had', 'been', 'cropped', 'off', 'original', 'release', 'So', 'bit', 'trade-off', 'terms', 'how', 'much', 'picture', ""'re"", 'getting', 'when', 'comparing', 'old', 'new', 'versions', 'quality', 'new', 'transfers', 'so', 'extremely', 'superior', 'old', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'mind', 'missing', 'tiny', 'bit', 'picture', 'upper', 'lower', 'portions', 'screen', 'all.A', 'quick', 'way', 'tell', 'edition', 'series', ""'re"", 'buying', 'look', 'covers', 'new', 'transfers', 'have', 'wide', 'bar', 'solid', 'colour', 'running', 'top', 'DVD', 'case', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'printed', 'large', 'capital', 'letters', 'writing', 'December', '2010', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 're-released', 'new', 'format', 'do', 'hope', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'will', 'follow', 'EXCELLENT', 'series']",N/A

In this second season, young Sarah Stanley & her friends find more adventures, with the introduction of some new characters.The episodes in this season are:Sarah's Homecoming : Sarah returns to Avonlea after a family tragedy. A sad episode.How Kissing was Discovered : the blossoming Felicity King pines for love, and suffers a crush... also we are introduced to a new character, a young man who has a sad past.Aunt Hetty's ordeal : Hetty King is visited by her old rival, Ms Stacey [the very same Ms Stacey, Anne's mentor in Anne of Green Gables]Of Corsets, and Secrets, and True, True Love: Rachel Lynde, and an old flame? Marilla takes in two orphaned relatives, much to Rachel's chagrin, and the ensuing pandemonium is hilarious.Old Quarrels, Old Love: Hetty King and her old beau are reunited. A sad episode.May the Best Man win: Olivia King is wooed by two men, the reliable Jasper Dale, and the pompous ex-beau who abandoned her once before.Family Rivalry: The other King sibling returns for a brief visit,but things are not all rosy with the King clan.The Sea Ghost : Michael York plays an old seaman here.Gus Pike's past returns to haunt him.All that Glitters : the possibility of hidden treasure on the island proves too hard to resist for Sarah, Gus and friends.Dreamer of Dreams : focuses on Jasper DaleIt's Just a Stage: Sarah's aunt, a famous stage actress comes to visit, with unsettling consequences.A Mother's Love: does one have to have experienced childbirth to be a 'real' mother? Avonlea is abuzz with the essay competition for Mother's Day.Misfits & Miracles: Ms Stacey brings a directive that the Avonlea school is to field a hockey team, and Sarah tries to learn how to skate. Also, the theme of development in the town is highlighted here.The second season is as good or even better than the first. The storylines flow smoothly, and the acting is excellent. We also notice the development of some of the characters, such as Gus Pike, whose story is developed this season. Olivia and Jasper are edging closer to being more than friends, and Sarah is truly at home in Avonlea. This is one of my favorite television series, and reminds me of a much more innocent time, when children truly lived their childhoods, and where good values were treasured and honored.",5,My favorite family series of all time!,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,2421,"['Watching', 'series', 'truly', 'mind', 'own', 'childhood', 'where', 'used', 'have', 'many', 'happy', 'adventures', 'friends', 'small', 'town', 'second', 'season', 'young', 'Sarah', 'Stanley', 'friends', 'find', 'more', 'adventures', 'introduction', 'new', 'characters.The', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'Sarah', 'Homecoming', 'Sarah', 'Avonlea', 'family', 'tragedy', 'sad', 'episode.How', 'Kissing', 'was', 'Discovered', 'blossoming', 'Felicity', 'King', 'pines', 'love', 'crush', 'also', 'are', 'introduced', 'new', 'character', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'sad', 'past.Aunt', 'Hetty', 'ordeal', 'Hetty', 'King', 'visited', 'old', 'rival', 'Ms', 'Stacey', 'very', 'same', 'Ms', 'Stacey', 'Anne', 'mentor', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', ']', 'Corsets', 'Secrets', 'True', 'True', 'Love', 'Rachel', 'Lynde', 'old', 'flame', 'Marilla', 'two', 'orphaned', 'relatives', 'much', 'Rachel', 'chagrin', 'ensuing', 'pandemonium', 'hilarious.Old', 'Quarrels', 'Old', 'Love', 'Hetty', 'King', 'old', 'beau', 'are', 'reunited', 'sad', 'episode.May', 'Best', 'Man', 'win', 'Olivia', 'King', 'wooed', 'two', 'men', 'reliable', 'Jasper', 'Dale', 'pompous', 'ex-beau', 'who', 'abandoned', 'once', 'before.Family', 'Rivalry', 'other', 'King', 'sibling', 'returns', 'brief', 'visit', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'rosy', 'King', 'clan.The', 'Sea', 'Ghost', 'Michael', 'York', 'old', 'seaman', 'Pike', 'past', 'returns', 'haunt', 'him.All', 'Glitters', 'possibility', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'island', 'too', 'hard', 'resist', 'Sarah', 'Gus', 'friends.Dreamer', 'Dreams', 'focuses', 'Jasper', 'DaleIt', 'Just', 'Stage', 'Sarah', 'aunt', 'famous', 'stage', 'actress', 'visit', 'unsettling', 'consequences.A', 'Mother', 'Love', 'one', 'have', 'have', 'experienced', 'childbirth', 'be', ""'real"", 'mother', 'Avonlea', 'abuzz', 'essay', 'competition', 'Mother', 'Day.Misfits', 'Miracles', 'Ms', 'Stacey', 'directive', 'Avonlea', 'school', 'field', 'hockey', 'team', 'Sarah', 'tries', 'learn', 'how', 'skate', 'Also', 'theme', 'development', 'town', 'highlighted', 'here.The', 'second', 'season', 'as', 'good', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'storylines', 'flow', 'smoothly', 'acting', 'excellent', 'also', 'notice', 'development', 'characters', 'such', 'Gus', 'Pike', 'story', 'developed', 'season', 'Olivia', 'Jasper', 'are', 'edging', 'closer', 'being', 'more', 'friends', 'Sarah', 'truly', 'home', 'Avonlea', 'one', 'favorite', 'television', 'series', 'much', 'more', 'innocent', 'time', 'when', 'children', 'truly', 'lived', 'childhoods', 'where', 'good', 'values', 'were', 'treasured', 'honored']",N/A
