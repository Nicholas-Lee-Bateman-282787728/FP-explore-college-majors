798287,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0001AVZM6,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","This is a long movie (just over three hours), and unless you have interest in the subject itself, or perhaps in the workings of the criminal justice system, it will likely seem too long. It's not too gory; there are quick photos of the victims, but no real closeups and attempts to gross us out. The worst is the Polanski manager having to rush outside to heave after he identifies the bodies.We all know the story of Charles Manson and his devoted followers, but this is told from the point of view of Vincent Bugliosi, the chief prosecutor on the case. Makes sense; he's the one who wrote the book by the same name. And he shows us all the mistakes and false leads and dead ends, including the news team that showed up the LAPD.Then there's the gun that was their most important piece of evidence sitting in a police evidence locker for months while nobody paid it any attention. They simply failed to connect the gun a kid had found on a hillside to the murder, even though the kid and his father made the suggestion when they handed it over to the cop. It's also heart-breaking to see the kid handle the gun carefully by the end of the barrel, explaining to his father that he had seen that done on TV to avoid messing up the fingerprints. He hands it over to the policeman, who puts his fingerprints all over it. You'd almost think he was working for Manson and wanted to trash the evidence, but it was really just major incompetence.There was a lot of police incompetence in this case, including how long it took for them to connect the Tate and LaBianca murders despite the similarities. I guess prior to the Manson cult, they had not had sufficient experience with the wigged-out irrational, and did not recognize it when they saw it. It was Bugliosi and his constant in-depth questioning of every witness he could get hold of that finally put together the link to Manson's concept of Helter Skelter as a racial war from which he would emerge as King of the World.That and Susan Atkins insane bragging to a friend in prison.Still, it was quite a fight the defendants put up, and a remarkable job by Bugliosi in pulling it all together and getting convictions. They were all sentenced to death, but then California ended the death penalty. So at the end of the movie (made in 1976), each of the murderers was named and labeled ""eligible to apply for parole in 1978"". I'm assuming that's why the movie was made when it was. As we know, Manson never was paroled, and is now a grizzled old man who doesn't really want to face the real world anymore.It's a disturbing movie, but well made. Especially for the fact that the actors and actresses really do look a lot like the people they portray.

798294,A3DSTOJPRMV674,B0001AVZM6,"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 6]","I'll never forget the evening I was browsing the local video store. On the shelf I ran across a copy of the 1976 made-for-TV miniseries &quot;Helter Skelter.&quot; Since I had never seen the film and had read the Vincent Bugliosi book on which it was based, I decided to rent it. Knowing full well the original series was around 200-plus minutes long, I picked up both copies of the tape assuming they were parts 1 and 2. With a line waiting behind me on that busy evening, the clerk looked at both tapes and screamed across the store, &quot;Is 'Helter Skelter' two tapes or just one!&quot;Every customer in the store stared at me, and I blushed as if I had just rented &quot;Showgirls.&quot; To this day, there's this ghastly boogeyman aura that surrounds Charles Manson and his puppet clique of attractive, promiscuous, murderous teenagers. This video version was only 98 minutes long, and for some strange reason, the store had two identical copies. Stupid me. Oh well, the original version of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; has now been released on DVD. So friends, family and dogs can now wallow in the full 200-minute criminal epic.After viewing the full-length version, I was surprised how closely it remained true to the known facts. The trial itself, which takes up the second half, is based entirely on court transcripts. And it gives us the best scene when Manson abruptly decides to make a statement to the courtroom. The jury was appropriately led out of court, though this was irrelevant to Mr. Charlie Boy. His speech was intended for reporters and audience members. The rambling proclamation, in which he discussed his skewed philosophy, is authentic (though I doubt he delivered it with unblinking eyes a la actor Steve Railsback). For the one and only moment of this stagy 1970s production (I was expecting Jack Webb to make an appearance any second) we see inside the demented philosophy of this horrible cult. It's probably as good a clue as any as to why these kids began committing random murders around Los Angeles during the summer of Woodstock, 1969.Fascination with the Charles Manson cult is nothing new. The book &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; has remained in print for years, making Bugliosi millions. A new made-for-TV movie is to be broadcast, including additional facts unknown in 1976. Fresh converts can now revel in a new-millennium retelling of the Manson mythos. Believe it or not, one can find as many books related to Manson as to the JFK assassination. It's a damn cottage industry. I have read several, the best of the lot being &quot;The Family,&quot; first published in 1971.The book, unlike this film, details the constant use of psychedelic drugs combined with the isolation of Spahn Ranch. Manson and family enter an alternative zone having little to do with President Johnson's Great Society. It became the Cult of White Trash Group Think, formed by the hangover of one endless lost summer weekend. Very little of this is seen in the 1976 film version. Manson is portrayed as some kind of Devil who can stop watches by smiling. The cops, adorned in the best polyester money can buy, eventually take down these very creepy kids - and thankfully so.There are no truths to be found in &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; just as there are no truths whenever someone tries to understand evil. It's fascinating, no doubt. Why else would we watch Bela Lugosi stand on a cobwebbed staircase uttering &quot;Children of the night. What music they make!&quot; I suppose Charles Manson is the vampire of our generation. He could even be Dracula, if Dracula were a hillbilly redneck who could barely read and write.",3,Stagy 1970s production,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,3634,"[""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'evening', 'was', 'browsing', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'shelf', 'ran', 'copy', '1976', 'made-for-TV', 'miniseries', 'quot', 'Helter', 'Skelter.', 'quot', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'had', 'read', 'Vincent', 'Bugliosi', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'decided', 'rent', 'Knowing', 'full', 'well', 'original', 'series', 'was', '200-plus', 'minutes', 'long', 'picked', 'up', 'copies', 'tape', 'assuming', 'were', 'parts', '1', '2', 'line', 'waiting', 'busy', 'evening', 'clerk', 'looked', 'tapes', 'screamed', 'store', 'quot', ""'Helter"", 'Skelter', 'two', 'tapes', 'just', 'one', 'quot', 'customer', 'store', 'stared', 'blushed', 'had', 'just', 'rented', 'quot', 'Showgirls.', 'quot', 'day', 'ghastly', 'boogeyman', 'aura', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'puppet', 'clique', 'attractive', 'promiscuous', 'murderous', 'teenagers', 'video', 'version', 'was', 'only', '98', 'minutes', 'long', 'strange', 'reason', 'store', 'had', 'two', 'identical', 'copies', 'Stupid', 'Oh', 'well', 'original', 'version', 'quot', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'quot', 'now', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'So', 'family', 'dogs', 'can', 'now', 'wallow', 'full', '200-minute', 'criminal', 'epic.After', 'viewing', 'full-length', 'version', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'closely', 'remained', 'true', 'known', 'facts', 'trial', 'up', 'second', 'half', 'based', 'entirely', 'court', 'transcripts', 'best', 'scene', 'when', 'Manson', 'abruptly', 'make', 'statement', 'courtroom', 'jury', 'was', 'appropriately', 'led', 'court', 'was', 'irrelevant', 'Mr.', 'Charlie', 'Boy', 'speech', 'was', 'intended', 'reporters', 'audience', 'members', 'rambling', 'proclamation', 'discussed', 'skewed', 'philosophy', 'authentic', 'doubt', 'delivered', 'unblinking', 'eyes', 'la', 'actor', 'Steve', 'Railsback', 'one', 'only', 'moment', 'stagy', '1970s', 'production', 'was', 'expecting', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'make', 'appearance', 'second', 'see', 'demented', 'philosophy', 'horrible', 'cult', 'probably', 'as', 'good', 'clue', 'as', 'why', 'kids', 'began', 'committing', 'random', 'murders', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'summer', 'Woodstock', '1969.Fascination', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'cult', 'nothing', 'new', 'book', 'quot', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'quot', 'remained', 'print', 'years', 'making', 'Bugliosi', 'millions', 'new', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'be', 'broadcast', 'including', 'additional', 'facts', 'unknown', '1976', 'Fresh', 'converts', 'can', 'now', 'revel', 'new-millennium', 'retelling', 'Manson', 'mythos', 'Believe', 'not', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'many', 'books', 'related', 'Manson', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'damn', 'cottage', 'industry', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'best', 'lot', 'being', 'quot', 'Family', 'quot', 'first', 'published', '1971.The', 'book', 'film', 'details', 'constant', 'use', 'psychedelic', 'drugs', 'combined', 'isolation', 'Spahn', 'Ranch', 'Manson', 'family', 'enter', 'alternative', 'zone', 'having', 'little', 'do', 'President', 'Johnson', 'Great', 'Society', 'became', 'Cult', 'White', 'Trash', 'Group', 'Think', 'formed', 'hangover', 'one', 'endless', 'lost', 'summer', 'weekend', 'Very', 'little', 'seen', '1976', 'film', 'version', 'Manson', 'portrayed', 'kind', 'Devil', 'who', 'can', 'stop', 'watches', 'smiling', 'cops', 'adorned', 'best', 'polyester', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'eventually', 'take', 'down', 'very', 'creepy', 'kids', 'thankfully', 'are', 'truths', 'be', 'found', 'quot', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'quot', 'just', 'are', 'truths', 'whenever', 'someone', 'understand', 'evil', 'fascinating', 'doubt', 'Why', 'else', 'would', 'watch', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'stand', 'cobwebbed', 'staircase', 'uttering', 'quot', 'Children', 'night', 'What', 'music', 'make', 'quot', 'suppose', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'vampire', 'generation', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'Dracula', 'Dracula', 'were', 'hillbilly', 'redneck', 'who', 'could', 'barely', 'read', 'write']",HELTER SKELTER (FF) (DVD)
798295,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,B0001AVZM6,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[7, 7]","Social and legal commentators have written or said the love and peace movements of the 1960's died Aug. 9, 1969, when members of Charles Manson's ""family"" descended on the home of director Roman Polanski and his 8 1/2-month pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, and slaughtered her and four houseguests. Seven years later, CBS brought the book of Vincent Bugliosi, the successful prosector of the case, to the screen, and this version remains the definitive ""entertainment"" piece of the Manson saga, far superior to its 2004 remade counterpart. And no one has equaled much less surpassed actor Steve Railsback's sociopathological depiction of the real Manson. This telepic is graphic in its brief recounting of the Tate killings and, a night later, those of Rosemary and Leno LaBianca. The film's power, though, is in its account of the legal problems that faced Buglosi as prosecutor and serves to dispell the assumption that the case against Manson, et al, was open and shut. In his protrayal of Bugliosi, actor George DiCenzo brings respect to the real-life prosecutor who, with the trial judge and jurors, endured the antics and threats of Manson and family members through, what then, was the longest criminal trial in U.S. history. Actor Railsback's Manson gets ample support from his co-defendants, played to the chilling hilt by Nancy Wolfe (Susan Atkins), Christine Hart (Patricia Krenwinkle) and Cathy Paine (Leslie Van Houten). A footnote to this production is that it features Sondra Blake, then married to actor Robert Blake, as Ronnie Howard, who shared a cell with the real Atkins and ""broke"" the case after Atkins started bragging about her role in the seven killings. ""Helter Skelter,"" so named from the Beatles' ""White Album"" song that Manson interpretted to be a ""message"" that the world was on the edge of an apocalyptic race war, remains an important commentary not only on the legal complexities of the case against the Manson clan, but it also touches on the vulnerability of those who either abandoned or been rejected by ""normal"" society and their exploitation by others seeking domination for whatever reason.

The sad AND Unbelievable part was, of course, that this all really happened.  The funny thing is the timing for this DVD release, considering that Helter Skelter is being remade as a T.V. movie.  Hopefully any review will remember it for the tragedy that it was and that to this day the victim's families have not forgotten that this crazy man was able to destroy their lives.

798298,A3673NBQVA4J2M,B0001AVZM6,"Daniel Hayes ""D.R. Hayes""","[1, 7]","Charles Manson. When I think of him I see many things crop out. Angry, Demented, Bruised, Scarred, Hateful, and all of this from the world. He was born into dysfunction, and lived out most of his life in dysfunction. His mother had no name to give him as she was mostly a criminal herself, and a prostitute who probably had no idea who fathered Charlie, or even cared. That's the hard part to swallow when your mother has no idea who your father is, and doesn't even care. She thought in her self-centered mind that she was doing the best for Charlie by shuffling him around to the different family members for she knew she couldn't raise Charlie as that would cut into her drug habit, and sex time. However, it was later determined that Charlie was bi-sexual as he wouldn't think twice about having sex with either a man, or a woman. I am left to wonder if perhaps a male family member raped Charlie perhaps out of anger at Charlie's mother for not taking responsibility for her little brat. I remember hearing a line in the film: ""The Bad News Bears In Breaking Training"" where Kelly's father asks Kelly: ""You want to be your own man?"" Meaning that Kelly take responsibility for himself; I'm sure Charlie wanted that, but the question I'm sure Charlie would ask: ""How to do this?"" No one showed Charlie how to be his own man, and the closest he came was his stint at Boy's Town, but when he was there I'm sure he couldn't look at Boy's Town without looking at his mother, family, and society in general, and they all hurt him, rejected him, and now as he's nearing 73 the hate will not die, and it looks as though it's the only thing keeping him going, but for how long? I feel that Charlie somehow learned that when he grew up that he could learn power, and take people down just give your soul to the devil. Susan Atkins would also take that route as her life was marred by dysfunction as both parents were alcoholics, and mean towards her and her brothers. She turned to Christ at an early age, but she was dissulousined especially after her mother died, and her father didn't stop drinking. Patricia Krenweinkel grew up in a more loving home, but after her parents divorced her self-esteem already not strong was even dashed upon the rocks more. Leslie Van Houten would also have her world fall apart when her parents divorced, so without a doubt on edge, and nothing to lose Charlie would create his own family. A family that was his to rule and reign one where he would be able to call the shots, and he would make it appealling to his followers with sex, drugs, and music. Now bring this up to August 9, 1969, and the Tate murders. In Charlie's mind he thought that he was doing the world a favor because after all Sharon Tate, Abigail Folger and others were all smoking marijuana, and doing other drugs, and they thought they were better than him? As for his motive I feel while it was created in a drug stupor quite a bit did come true. I would feel the fact that Terry Melchner not taking Charlie seriously as a musician, and standing him up would be a more rational motive for murder, but Manson didn't know that Melchner had moved out of that house a few months earlier. Mind you this wouldn't have been acceptable either, but more rational. Many wannabe followers called this trial: ""The Second Crucifixtion Of Christ"" Anyway as I mentioned earlier quite a bit of his prophecy came true; In certain people they feel that minorities are getting preferential treatment, definition of family is becoming more and more broader, children are becoming more and more aggressive, and motive for crime is becoming more and more trivial, and God doesn't seem to be on most people's minds anymore. I don't even know where to begin as to where the country began it's downfall; was it when sexuality was starting to become more studied, was it during McCarthyism?, or when Madeline Muhaney O Hare successfully lobbied to have prayer banned from school. I know I have said I hate the 80's, but to be honest wouldn't the 80's be fruit of what the 60's became? America seems to just wish that anniversaries like this would just go away. Woodstock would be an attempt to save the 60's from despair, but got upstaged by Camille as she ripped through the Mississippi Delta destroying homes. Let's face it folks we as Americans tend to want to repress the negative, and just go on with the positive. We want to think that if we think about it that it will just come back to us, but when the pain is so much we tend to not care anymore, and just do whatever it took to just prove to everyone that we had our act together. I feel with Charlie it was repression that more or less caused him to collapse under all that weight that he carried all his life to come to August 9, 1969. This was the original telemovie aired on Thursday and Friday April 1 and 2nd, 1976 on CBS. I remember this because I was 8, and I wanted to watch it real bad, and was upset that I couldn't. I finally did at 23, and to be honest I see what I missed. The performance by George DiCenzo was good, but to be honest he's forgetable now, Steve Railsback as Manson was almost comical, but impressive. This would also introduce the world to the most famous Beatles tribute band ""Beatlemania"", and they would do an American tour the Summer of 76. This was above-average telemovie, and has the makings of a wonderful story. Not wonderful in the sense of what happened, but it stayed with what really happened.",5,Without a doubt one of the people that have left a mark on me,1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,5471,"['Charles',

798300,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B0001AVZM6,David Von Pein,"[75, 77]","1976's ""Helter Skelter"" is an intense and quite suspenseful TV movie, starring Steve Railsback, who is so good as Charles Manson, it's rather eerie.  The film also stars George DiCenzo, as Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi.  The tele-film is based on Mr. Bugliosi's best-selling true-crime novel of the same title.The film is told in semi-documentary style (with DiCenzo doubling as narrator throughout the movie).  It begins with a very spine-chilling scene in the early-morning hours of August 9, 1969, in Los Angeles, California.  We hear multiple gunshots from a distance.  Gunshots which emanated from nearby 10050 Cielo Drive, the home of movie director Roman Polanski and his pregnant wife, 26-year-old actress Sharon Tate.The gunshots were fired by a member of Charles Manson's so-called ""Family"".  And so began one of the most bizarre chapters in the history of crime -- a senseless massacre, claiming the lives of seven innocent people, that became commonly known as the ""Tate/LaBianca Murders"".Manson's ""zombie"" killers racked up five murders at the Tate residence, and the next night went out and killed two more people they had never met, Mr. and Mrs. LaBianca, at 3301 Waverly Drive, in another part of Los Angeles (Los Feliz).(In my own view, Manson and his team of brainwashed murderers should *really* have been charged with EIGHT killings in August 1969. Number eight being the unborn child of Sharon Tate.)The film recreates the discovery of the two grisly murder scenes with nerve-wracking effectiveness, but without showing too much gore, which is all the better (as well as tasteful).  But the fact that this was a 1976 made-for-TV feature no doubt limited the filmmakers with regard to showing material of an overly-graphic nature.The story of the brutal killings and the lengthy court trial that followed is detailed very well in this rarely-seen, full-length (184-minute) DVD version of ""Helter Skelter"".  The previous video (VHS) release of the film only ran a paltry 119 minutes, with (obviously) many scenes cut from the original print.The movie was originally shown as a ""2-Parter"" on network television, with a total running time of 194 minutes (10 minutes longer than what we get on this DVD).  But, despite missing ten minutes, we're not really losing any relative scenes or information.  Because the ten minutes that are missing are simply ""recap"" scenes that were used for the network telecast in order to re-acquaint viewers with the storyline and previous ""Part 1"" scenes. Plus, also trimmed from the DVD version is a needless ""end credits from Part 1"" sequence.  Therefore, this 184-minute version of the film *is*, in effect, the ""complete"" film (when taken in the context of a ""one-part"" motion picture, rather than a two-parter).The icing on this movie's cake is the brilliant and highly-effective music score by Billy Goldenberg.  Goldenberg's unsettling score evokes a feeling of uneasiness and is downright scary in many instances during the film.Mr. Goldenberg was one busy music composer in the 1970s.  He wrote musical themes to many TV shows during that era -- including: ""Rhoda"", ""Night Gallery"", ""Banacek"", ""Kojak"", ""Harry O"", and lots of others.The DVD's aspect ratio is Full-Frame (1.33:1), as originally shown on TV.  Video quality on this disc looks very sharp and clear. I am extremely pleased with the picture quality. There's an occasional blemish, artifact, or dust speckle, but not very many. Certainly not enough to create a distraction.  In fact, even the nighttime images in the film (which can often look ""grainy"" on an older movie) exhibit excellent clarity here, with very little grain visible.I've found that another good ""test"" of a DVD's picture quality (that's worked well for me) is the ""Freeze Frame Test"".  Try ""freezing"" any image on the DVD.  Does the stilled picture become blurry, distorted-looking, and fuzzy?  If it can't be ""frozen"" without blurring (or minimal blurring), then I'd give that DVD video transfer a lower mark on the old ""PQ Scorecard"" than a more solid transfer where the picture can be paused and frozen in near-perfect clarity.  ""Helter Skelter"", in my view, passes the ""Freeze Test"" very nicely.  Non-moving images on screen can be paused with little or no blurriness resulting.In short, this DVD offers up a very good Digital transfer for a TV-Movie made in 1976.This snazzy-looking DVD version of ""Helter Skelter"" makes my ultra-poor, third-generation VHS copy of the film look mighty crummy indeed!  Needless to say, that VHS video is now destined for the scrap pile.The soundtrack offered up here is a 1.0 Dolby Digital Mono track; and it's quite adequate (although a small amount of ""ghosting"" is evident during some parts of the film).  Mr. Goldenberg's shiver-inducing musical score comes through just fine via this mono presentation.  And all dialogue sounds distinct, clear, and is easily understood.Extra Features .... There are none (unless you want to count subtitles, which are included -- in English, French, and Spanish).  But this lack of extras doesn't disappoint me greatly.  Just getting this excellent TV film in top-quality Digital form on DVD is enough for me.  (Although I would have *loved* a commentary by the real-life Manson prosecutor, Vince Bugliosi.  But I figured that was too much to hope for. And it was.)Menus .... The menus for ""Helter Skelter"" are ""static"" (non-animated) ones, with the Main Menu being accompanied by a variation of the eerie music score.

798304,A29COAL60SB48B,B0001AVZM6,Donna Di Giacomo,"[8, 9]","This movie came out the year I was born, 1976, but I had heard about the ""Charles Manson murders"" all my life. I remember as a child hearing The Beatles song of the same name (which supposedly inspired the kooky Manson to start his little race war) and being completely freaked out by it. It was after I became a very dedicated Beatles fan that I learned that the song, written by Paul Mc Cartney, was actually a response to a song by The Who that was proclaimed to be the loudest, dirtiest, most raucous thing ever done in rock and roll up until that point in time. Mc Cartney decided to top it with a Beatles ditty.The song ""Helter Skelter"" was, originally, a 27 minute track but was eventually cut down to 5 minutes because of time limits on radio airplay. It was never a call to arms or revolution. In fact, the term ""helter skelter"" is a British word for a carnival ride. (And thank you Bono of U2 for ""stealing back"" that song!)Director/producer Tom Gries did a pretty good job of transferring Vincent Bugliosi's account of the trial onto the small screen (the DVD was a top notch, enjoyable viewing experience). I was disappointed, though, that the actors and actresses really didn't resemble the so-called ""family."" Only Steve Railsback remotely looked like Manson. (Although, I thought the actress playing Linda Kasabian looked very familiar. The end credits confirmed my suspicion: She was Marilyn Burns, who was in the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" two years before).I did appreciate the trial scenes because it makes one think of the numerous, far out objections of one Irving Kanarek (Manson's attorney), who dragged the trial on far past the time that it should have lasted (costing California taxpayers millions of dollars in the process) to the nuisance of everyone involved. Why he wasn't disbarred during that trial, I will never understand (refreshing to know he got his in the end when the US Supreme Court disbarred him in 1990).The movie accentuated the dedication of D.A. Vincent Bugliosi and the fact that the law profession could definitely use more lawyers like him. Although a bit too conservative for me, the bottom line is he's a very competent attorney who knows his law and practices it with the highest set of ethics.In the end, this movie underlined how much the ""victims"" were forgotten during the course of the trial. They took a backseat to the carnival antics in the courtroom and would always be relegated to an afterthought (and sometimes not even that!).Since the murders, Manson has been elevated to a cult hero, Sharon called every horrible name in the book (the rest of the victims' names nearly forgotten, except to those who knew and loved them), and many cruel rumors were circulated during the course of the investigation and trial.But, as the saying goes, truth is always stranger than fiction.  Those people (Sharon, Jay, Abigail, and Voytek) came back from having dinner. Sharon and Jay talked while lying on the bed in the master bedroom, Abigail was in her bedroom reading a book and Voytek was napping on the living room couch when a group of wackjobs - strung out on acid, following the orders of a pint-sized dork po'd because he couldn't get a record deal - decided to take their lives and ruin the lives of their families and friends forever.Sad to think that Charles Watson, who helped stab a pregnant woman, now has 4 children himself until Sharon's mother, the late Doris, put an end to conjugal visits in prison for convicted murderers through her tireless campaign for victims rights. Poor Steven Parent was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time (much like Ron Goldman would be 25 years later) and equally vicious rumors circulated about Leno and Rosemary La Bianca.The saddest part of all is that, nowadays, whenever you're seen with a photo of or book about Sharon Tate, for instance, people automatically think of C. M. and think something is wrong with *you* for wanting to know more about the ""victims"" of that horrible night in American history (people draw blanks with the rest of the ""victims"" names).The time is way past due for the media to remember these people for the people that they were and not merely as ""murder victims.""  The time has also come to remember that Roman Polanski, too, was a victim and to regard him in a more positive light than the animal who orchestrated his pregnant wife's murder.Bugliosi's book should be required reading on how NOT to bungle a murder investigation (Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden could have definitely benefited!).",4,Interesting to a point,1131753600,"11 12,

Technically, it's one of the better DVD's this reviewer has seen in quite a while.  The format reproduces the 1.33:1 video aspect of the original TV film and the colors are true to life.  The audio quality is clear and sharp.  This DVD is a treat to watch and listen to.The film relates the horrendous events of the nights of August 8-9, 1969, when seven people turned up murdered for seemingly no reason: five people (six, if you count Sharon Tate's expected child, two months away from being born) at 10050 Cielo Drive, the home Tate shared with her husband, the movie director Roman Polanski, and Rosemary and Leno LoBianco the next night in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles.  The victims were shot and slashed to death, and political slogans were written on the walls and fridigaire in their own blood.  There are no initial clues and no suspects, until the connection is made to a prisoner named Bobby Beausoleil who committed a similar homicide.  Gradually, the trail leads back to a group of demented hippies living on a dilapidated ranch under the leadership of a charismatic drifter named Charles Manson.  As the evidence builds and three young women are arrested, there is a lot of talk about &quot;love&quot; and &quot;surrender&quot; and &quot;Charlie is Jesus Christ&quot; to emphasize how completely these young people have fallen under Manson's domination, but the film pulls no punches and makes no excuses; this is a wolf pack of cold-blooded killers.  This isn't some group of free-love hippies; these people can -- and do -- murder anyone who crosses them, including one of Manson's own defense attorneys, with about as much compunction as a killing machine.George DiCenzo ably plays the dual roles of narrator and lead prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, who comes across in the film as more likeable and less full of himself than he does in his book from which this film was adapted.  The actresses playing Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel are all excellent; we look into their eyes and see hell.  But whoever cast Steve Railsback in the role of Charles Manson deserves a special award for the casting coup of the decade.  Railsback is unbelievable as Manson, with whom he shares an almost frightening resemblance, staring at the viewer with those insane eyes.  Railsback actually has little to say in the film, compared to some of the other characters, but those mesmerizing snake-eyes say everything.The film's coda is scary in itself; DiCenzo as the narrator, informing the viewer that California outlawed the death penalty that Manson and his crew so richly deserved and got, and that their automatic sentences of life imprisonment were up for parole review in 1978, or only two years from the date the film was shown on TV.  Watching this movie again, and recalling the ghastly events of those two nights in August of 1969, we breathe a sigh of relief that almost 35 years later, the Tate-LoBianco killers are still behind bars.",5,Great leap forward to DVD,1082592000,"04 22, 2004",2004,3162,"['quot', 'Helter-Skelter', 'quot', 'excellent', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'based', 'Tate-LoBianco', 'murders', '1969', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'entirety', 'DVD', 'result', 'worth', 'waiting', 'Technically', 'one', 'better', 'DVD', 'reviewer', 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'format', '1.33:1', 'video', 'aspect', 'original', 'TV', 'film', 'colors', 'are', 'true', 'life', 'audio', 'quality', 'clear', 'sharp', 'DVD', 'treat', 'watch', 'listen', 'to.The', 'film', 'horrendous', 'events', 'nights', 'August', '8-9', '1969', 'when', 'seven', 'people', 'turned', 'up', 'murdered', 'seemingly', 'reason', 'five', 'people', 'six', 'count', 'Sharon', 'Tate', 'expected', 'child', 'two', 'months', 'away', 'being', 'born', '10050', 'Cielo', 'Drive', 'home', 'Tate', 'shared', 'husband', 'movie', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Rosemary', 'Leno', 'LoBianco', 'next', 'night', 'Los', 'Feliz', 'section', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'victims', 'were', 'shot', 'slashed', 'death', 'political', 'slogans', 'were', 'written', 'walls', 'fridigaire', 'own', 'blood', 'are', 'initial', 'clues', 'suspects', 'connection', 'made', 'prisoner', 'named', 'Bobby', 'Beausoleil', 'who', 'committed', 'similar', 'homicide', 'Gradually', 'trail', 'back', 'group', 'demented', 'hippies', 'living', 'dilapidated', 'ranch', 'leadership', 'charismatic', 'drifter', 'named', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'evidence', 'builds', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'arrested', 'lot', 'talk', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Charlie', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'quot', 'emphasize', 'how', 'completely', 'young', 'people', 'have', 'fallen', 'Manson', 'domination', 'film', 'punches', 'excuses', 'wolf', 'pack', 'cold-blooded', 'killers', ""n't"", 'group', 'free-love', 'hippies', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'murder', 'anyone', 'who', 'including', 'one', 'Manson', 'own', 'defense', 'attorneys', 'about', 'much', 'compunction', 'killing', 'machine.George', 'DiCenzo', 'ably', 'dual', 'roles', 'narrator', 'lead', 'prosecutor', 'Vincent', 'Bugliosi', 'who', 'film', 'more', 'likeable', 'less', 'full', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Susan', 'Atkins', 'Leslie', 'Van', 'Houten', 'Patricia', 'Krenwinkel', 'are', 'excellent', 'look', 'eyes', 'see', 'hell', 'whoever', 'cast', 'Steve', 'Railsback', 'role', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'special', 'award', 'casting', 'coup', 'decade', 'Railsback', 'unbelievable', 'Manson', 'whom', 'shares', 'almost', 'frightening', 'resemblance', 'staring', 'viewer', 'insane', 'eyes', 'Railsback', 'actually', 'little', 'say', 'film', 'compared', 'other', 'characters', 'mesmerizing', 'snake-eyes', 'say', 'everything.The', 'film', 'coda', 'scary', 'DiCenzo', 'narrator', 'informing', 'viewer', 'California', 'outlawed', 'death', 'penalty', 'Manson', 'crew', 'so', 'richly', 'deserved', 'got', 'automatic', 'sentences', 'life', 'imprisonment', 'were', 'up', 'parole', 'review', '1978', 'only', 'two', 'years', 'date', 'film', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', 'Watching', 'movie', 'again', 'recalling', 'ghastly', 'events', 'two', 'nights', 'August', '1969', 'breathe', 'sigh', 'relief', 'almost', '35', 'years', 'later', 'Tate-LoBianco', 'killers', 'are', 'still', 'bars']",HELTER SKELTER (FF) (DVD)

Gonzalez,"[0, 0]","This review is to clarify some confusion over the release of the Key Video VHS version (released on VHS in the 80's and the DVD version available today from WB.I have this film taped off of television in it's original 2 part version. The DVD that is available today is that same version (made for TV) that has both parts 1 and 2 spliced together. What has been eliminated is the closing credits from part 1 - (it ends with a close-up of Mansons face after Vincent Bugliosi's watch stopped) and the opening credits and flashback at the beginning of part 2. On the DVD version if you look at the closing credits at the end of the movie you will still see it states 'cast part 2.' The DVD contains the film version as it was shown on television here in 1976. There was however an alternate version shown in theaters overseas at that time and that version in on the Key Video VHS release.Many people who have owned or rented that version remember a slightly different version of this movie. For years I was told that the VHS version (that is about 2hrs long) was an edited down version of this film. While that is partially true, it also contains scenes not seen in the TV version that is on DVD.For example, The VHS version contains: Longer shots of the crime scene at the beginning of the film, including longer shots of Sharon Tate and Leno Labianca on the floor of his living room.Brief nudity in the Spahn ranch raid (alternate shots) not seen in the DVD version.During the raid scene a bit of dialog between Manson and Shorty Shea where Manson says, ""It's not nice to snitch Shorty"" and Shea responds ""Go f*** yourself Charlie"" (on the DVD and the made for TV version he responds ""horse manure."")The biggest difference between both versions is the actual murder scenes. On the DVD version they are super imposed with Linda Kasabian's testimony and shots of Manson on trial, on the VHS version we get direct full screen shots of the crime including the shooting of Steve Parent and the stabbing and shooting of Voytek and Abigale (very graphic longer scenes) which was not shown on television in this manner.There are other slight differences that I won't go into here, (such as when Charlie first meets Linda Kasabian) but those listed above are the most noticible.This is a great movie and the DVD is a good buy if you want the longer made for TV version. But if your a fan of this stuff don't overlook the VHS version (now out of print) - it is not just the TV version edited down, it's a whole lot more.",5,HELTER SKELTER VHS version clarification!,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,2508,"['review', 'clarify', 'confusion', 'release', 'Key', 'Video', 'VHS', 'version', 'released', 'VHS', '80', 'DVD', 'version', 'available', 'today', 'WB.I', 'have', 'film', 'taped', 'television', 'original', '2', 'part', 'version', 'DVD', 'available', 'today', 'same', 'version', 'made', 'TV', 'parts', '1', '2', 'spliced', 'together', 'What', 'been', 'eliminated', 'closing', 'credits', 'part', '1', 'close-up', 'Mansons', 'face', 'Vincent', 'Bugliosi', 'watch', 'stopped', 'opening', 'credits', 'flashback', 'beginning', 'part', '2', 'DVD', 'version', 'look', 'closing', 'credits', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'still', 'see', 'part', '2', 'DVD', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'shown', 'television', 'here', '1976', 'was', 'however', 'alternate', 'version', 'shown', 'theaters', 'overseas', 'time', 'version', 'Key', 'Video', 'VHS', 'release.Many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'owned', 'rented', 'version', 'remember', 'slightly', 'different', 'version', 'movie', 'years', 'was', 'told', 'VHS', 'version', '2hrs', 'long', 'was', 'edited', 'version', 'film', 'partially', 'true', 'also', 'scenes', 'not', 'seen', 'TV', 'version', 'DVD.For', 'example', 'VHS', 'version', 'contains', 'Longer', 'shots', 'crime', 'scene', 'beginning', 'film', 'including', 'longer', 'shots', 'Sharon', 'Tate', 'Leno', 'Labianca', 'floor', 'living', 'room.Brief', 'nudity', 'Spahn', 'ranch', 'raid', 'alternate', 'shots', 'not', 'seen', 'DVD', 'version.During', 'raid', 'scene', 'bit', 'dialog', 'Manson', 'Shorty', 'Shea', 'where', 'Manson', 'not', 'nice', 'snitch', 'Shorty', 'Shea', 'Go', 'f***', 'Charlie', 'DVD', 'made', 'TV', 'version', 'horse', 'manure', 'biggest', 'difference', 'versions', 'actual', 'murder', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'version', 'are', 'super', 'imposed', 'Linda', 'Kasabian', 'testimony', 'shots', 'Manson', 'trial', 'VHS', 'version', 'get', 'direct', 'full', 'screen', 'shots', 'crime', 'including', 'shooting', 'Steve', 'Parent', 'stabbing', 'shooting', 'Voytek', 'Abigale', 'very', 'graphic', 'longer', 'scenes', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'television', 'are', 'other', 'slight', 'differences', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'here', 'such', 'when', 'Charlie', 'first', 'Linda', 'Kasabian', 'listed', 'above', 'are', 'most', 'noticible.This', 'great', 'movie', 'DVD', 'good', 'buy', 'want', 'longer', 'made', 'TV', 'version', 'fan', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'VHS', 'version', 'now', 'print', 'not', 'just', 'TV', 'version', 'edited', 'down', 'whole', 'lot', 'more']",HELTER SKELTER (FF) (DVD)

Although some events are slightly altered, this film is 95% accurate. Considering this was made in 1976, it holds up very well. And, as I understand it, it was and still ranks as one of the highest rated tv movies of all time. Very ground breaking for a 1976 tv movie.It defines an era that ended the &quot;peace and love&quot; late 60's flower power.Charles Manson and his sick, demented &quot;family&quot; is depicted in startling reality.The film covers everything from the murders, to the compelling trial that followed. Much of the original statements and testimony in the trial are repeated here.Excellent acting, writing, production and direction.Sharon Tate, and the other victims died in a horrible fashion none of us would ever want to experiance.If the story wasn't true, we would never have believed the sick members of the so called &quot;Manson family&quot; could do such a horrific crime.The only thing I would like to add is, it's just horrible the death penalty was briefly abolished, as these killers all deserved to die instead of being kept alive with our tax dollars, not to mention it is a mockery they are even given parole hearings.I pray to God they never ever get released.I live less than two miles from the Labianca house, and just knowing it is there gives me chills.It will be interesting when CBS airs the re-make next month. Some say a re-make should not be made. I think reminding the public of how horrific these crimes were IS important, as maybe it will inspire people to continue to send letters protesting the release of the killers each time they are up for parole.All the killers now say they have found God, and should be released.Well, the victims will never get the chance, as they are buried, so I simply feel the killers deserve to rot in jail the rest of their pathetic lives. If they truly have found God, they should realise what they did deserves punishment on this earth, and they should direct their goals to helping fellow inmates to learn from their mistakes.Parole?

I've never seen any actor in any role portray a character better than this.  Railsback was so good that it's almost surreal.  His 'look', his hair, tone of voice, body shape and size, even the eerie shine in his eyes - so close to Charley that when I saw Railsback in various other roles years later I didn't even recognize him.  Then, when you read Bugliosi's vastly detailed book, today's version more than 500 pages, then you will be equally surprised at how accurate the film is.  TV films are notorious for being underfunded, which is the reason why events at Barker's Ranch were left out, but in this case the producers were so familiar with Bugliosi's account that it isn't a necessity to read the book.  In just 3 hours you get the full story and full impact of a totally bizarre, inexplicable murder case that wasn't closed until 2 years and 2 months after it happened.

Customers, PLEASE becareful when purchasing. This one says (2004) THIS cover is for the 1976 version and not the 2004 version.You will be sooooo very disappointed to pay good money for the 2004 version with out having watched the 1976 version. Be sure to read the packaging closely because the two movies ARE of the same subject, but NOT the same quality at all.As I have responded to another customer (which my response for the 1976 is a review/response to this version and is already quite lengthy and very positive about the 1976 release). There are TWO different versions and the second was a remake. There are differences for every package.The cover art may have been released differently within this decade BUT could be the 1976 version and yet someone may inadvertantly upload the 1976 cover art when they are REALLY trying to sell the 2004 version remake.Please be very careful as this can be exasperating to expect one version ONLY to get a version that doesn't even meet up to the original.Make sure that the seller has the version that you want and the version most popular is the 1976 version with Steve Railsback as Charles Manson.Double check your purchasing and know which version that you are investing in because the sellers can confuse the two and there have been mix ups like this whenever someone uploads a varying cover art , however, a completely different version.The 1976 version is THE CLOSEST that you will EVER get to what that period was like and it is much scarier than the remake. The remake scared America (Once again) the night that they were going to air it and once it was aired, it was a joke and not even as close to the 1976 version.Many people thought that the REMAKE would stir up ""copy cat Mansons"" and this was a TRUE CONCERN and was even written in the newspapers before it aired that night. It was a big deal for the veterans (those of us who are old enough to clearly remember the actual case) of this case.We lived in California at the time that the remake was announced to be aired and (not for the same reasons, but because the case was sill fresh in our minds back then in the 1970s and that as a country, we were scared of this type of criminal, it was a new type of criminal at that time ---1970s---and it was something that many of us just did not understand and were frightened of the reality of this monster) there was the same tension that was in the air when the 1976 version aired and America had a reason to be nervous because THAT 1976 version hit very close to home, particularly if you live in California or are a native of California (doesn't matter which direction---Manson had a very, very long reach when he was younger and powerful at that time).",1,Helter Skelter Remake 2004,1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,2818,"['have', 'already', 'written', 'enough', '1976', 'version', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'have', 'just', 'notice', 'something', 'Customers', 'PLEASE', 'becareful', 'when', 'purchasing', 'one', '2004', 'THIS', 'cover', '1976', 'version', 'not', '2004', 'version.You', 'will', 'be', 'sooooo', 'very', 'disappointed', 'pay', 'good', 'money', '2004', 'version', 'out', 'having', 'watched', '1976', 'version', 'Be', 'sure', 'read', 'packaging', 'closely', 'two', 'movies', 'ARE', 'same', 'subject', 'NOT', 'same', 'quality', 'all.As', 'have', 'responded', 'customer', 'response', '1976', 'review/response', 'version', 'already', 'quite', 'lengthy', 'very', 'positive', '1976', 'release', 'are', 'TWO', 'different', 'versions', 'second', 'was', 'remake', 'are', 'differences', 'package.The', 'cover', 'art', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'differently', 'decade', 'BUT', 'could', 'be', '1976', 'version', 'yet', 'someone', 'may', 'inadvertantly', 'upload', '1976', 'cover', 'art', 'when', 'are', 'REALLY', 'trying', 'sell', '2004', 'version', 'remake.Please', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'can', 'be', 'exasperating', 'expect', 'one', 'version', 'ONLY', 'get', 'version', ""n't"", 'even', 'meet', 'up', 'original.Make', 'sure', 'seller', 'version', 'want', 'version', 'most', 'popular', '1976', 'version', 'Steve', 'Railsback', 'Charles', 'Manson.Double', 'check', 'purchasing', 'know', 'version', 'are', 'investing', 'sellers', 'can', 'confuse', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'mix', 'ups', 'someone', 'varying', 'cover', 'art', 'however', 'completely', 'different', 'version.The', '1976', 'version', 'CLOSEST', 'will', 'EVER', 'get', 'what', 'period', 'was', 'much', 'scarier', 'remake', 'remake', 'scared', 'America', 'Once', 'again', 'night', 'were', 'going', 'air', 'once', 'was', 'aired', 'was', 'joke', 'not', 'even', 'close', '1976', 'version.Many', 'people', 'thought', 'REMAKE', 'would', 'stir', 'up', 'copy', 'cat', 'Mansons', 'was', 'TRUE', 'CONCERN', 'was', 'even', 'written', 'newspapers', 'aired', 'night', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'veterans', 'who', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'clearly', 'remember', 'actual', 'case', 'case.We', 'lived', 'California', 'time', 'remake', 'was', 'announced', 'be', 'aired', 'not', 'same', 'reasons', 'case', 'was', 'sill', 'fresh', 'minds', 'back', 'then', '1970s', 'country', 'were', 'scared', 'type', 'criminal', 'was', 'new', 'type', 'criminal', 'time', '-1970s', '-and', 'was', 'something', 'many', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'were', 'frightened', 'reality', 'monster', 'was', 'same', 'tension', 'was', 'air', 'when', '1976', 'version', 'aired', 'America', 'had', 'reason', 'be', 'nervous', '1976', 'version', 'hit', 'very', 'close', 'home', 'particularly', 'live', 'California', 'are', 'native', 'California', ""n't"", 'matter', 'direction', '-Manson', 'had', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'reach', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'powerful', 'time']",HELTER SKELTER (FF) (DVD)

But to those of us who lived through those days, especially in Southern California's San Fernando Valley, the potency of the crimes and this remarkable tele-film still reverberate today.The movie covers an amazing amount of factual ground and does justice to Vincent Bugliosi's massive, definitive account of the Manson Family and the era in which he operated.  As a movie, it's a classic example of mixing documentary style dialogue with first-rate characterizations.  Though Steve Railsback's frighteningly realistic performance allegedly typecast him, this actually adds to the impact of his superb performance--it was simply TOO good.  George DiCenzo is appropriately business-like as Bugliosi at the start, then slowly grows more impassioned and frustrated as the travails of the justice system wind before him.  All the ""Manson Girl"" roles are performed well, Marilyn Burns is poignant as Linda Kasabian, but special kudos should go to Nancy Wolfe as Susan Atkins.  At the least, she should have gotten a supporting actress Emmy nomination, if not the award, for her stunning depiction of the robotic, demented Manson slave who was perhaps more frightening than the leader himself.  Also noteworthy are Sondra Blake (yes, Robert's ex)as the brave Ronnie Howard and young Jon Gries as the caretaker initially suspected of the Cielo drive murders.  All in all, this film stands the test of time and is even more impressive next to the sickly ""reimagined"" version that played on early 2004 television.  Some classics don't need remaking.

It wasn't a fast process easy. People joined the cult because they wanted to get away from their stifling conservative upbringing and embrace a new post-structural form of morality. The problem that happens when you make up your own rules and form subcultures is the fact that you feel guilty for rejecting people. Rejection is supposed to be in the realm of the conformists. You should be accepting of everyone in certain subcultures and that means that you can be making yourself vulnerable to sociopaths. These kids were particularly vulnerable to the manipulation of a sociopath.Unfortunately, like the book, this movie concerns itself with the court case. It delves into Manson a little, but it shows us what people in the late sixties saw - one crazy dude and his followers who couldn't stop interrupting court proceedings. The movie is very much a product of its times - the 70s &#34;let's get tough on crime&#34; belief that led to our current system where jails are overcrowded and the best society has to offer in anti-recidivist programs is Scared Straight. The cult members are just crazy or evil, laughing and cackling all along. The actor is doing a Manson imitation without capturing any of his charisma and at the end of the movie, we find out that everyone is up for parole in a few years (without acknowledging that no parole board would actually let them out - even when they are claim born again status)I could have done without the sermons. I don't know if anyone really needed to know that killer hippies are horrible.",2,Mostly a hagiography for Vincent Bugliosi,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,1986,"['end', 'movie', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'Bugliosi', 'directly', 'want', 'affirmation', 'Bugliosi', 'boldly', 'Manson', 'just', 'con', 'artist', 'who', 'manipulated', 'bunch', 'kids', 'scene', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'more', 'court', 'case', 'Manson.One', 'most', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'Manson', 'cult', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'went', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'were', 'willing', 'go', 'stay', 'cult', 'was', ""n't"", 'fast', 'process', 'easy', 'People', 'joined', 'cult', 'wanted', 'get', 'away', 'stifling', 'conservative', 'upbringing', 'embrace', 'new', 'post-structural', 'form', 'morality', 'problem', 'when', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'rules', 'form', 'subcultures', 'fact', 'feel', 'guilty', 'rejecting', 'people', 'Rejection', 'supposed', 'be', 'realm', 'conformists', 'should', 'be', 'accepting', 'everyone', 'certain', 'subcultures', 'can', 'be', 'making', 'vulnerable', 'sociopaths', 'kids', 'were', 'particularly', 'vulnerable', 'manipulation', 'sociopath.Unfortunately', 'book', 'movie', 'court', 'case', 'Manson', 'little', 'people', 'late', 'sixties', 'saw', 'one', 'crazy', 'dude', 'followers', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'interrupting', 'court', 'proceedings', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'product', 'times', '70s', '34', 'let', 'get', 'tough', 'crime', '34', 'belief', 'led', 'current', 'system', 'where', 'jails', 'are', 'overcrowded', 'best', 'society', 'offer', 'anti-recidivist', 'programs', 'Scared', 'Straight', 'cult', 'members', 'are', 'just', 'crazy', 'evil', 'laughing', 'cackling', 'along', 'actor', 'doing', 'Manson', 'imitation', 'capturing', 'charisma', 'end', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'everyone', 'up', 'parole', 'few', 'years', 'acknowledging', 'parole', 'board', 'would', 'actually', 'let', 'out', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'claim', 'born', 'again', 'status', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'sermons', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'really', 'needed', 'know', 'killer', 'hippies', 'are', 'horrible']",HELTER SKELTER (FF) (DVD)

Watt,"[1, 1]","Made-for-tv movie, released in 1976, Helter Skelter features the best portrayal of Manson by an actor I've seen yet in the performance of Steve Railsback (even if he's slightly over-the-top at times). Funny how this movie contains no nudity and little to no graphic violence, yet remains the most effective Manson docudrama to date.

My grandparents had the book back in the 70's and I would always scare myself ****less looking at the crime scene photos. No idea why. I have always felt an odd connection to this era even though I was born only a year before the Tate/LaBianca killings. I often shock friends and family with intimate details of the names and dates, needless to say, I'm great at parties:)I do not glorify what has been done though I marvel at the details. Even though I gave this movie FIVE stars it is not a perfect movie by any means, however, in light of this being a Made for TV movie from 1976 I can't imagine a more brutal or shocking depiction being made. The soundtrack is what sets off the movie and only adds to the chill.Charles Manson, Susan Atkins, and Leslie Van Houten as portrayed here are downright frightening. The actors seem to have risen above the TV pap and have given what are probably the best ever TV Movie performances. Even the Manson gang not on trial like the actor who played Danny DiCarlo gives a riveting performance, and lets not forget the actor who helps Bugliosi translate Charlie's ""RevolAtion No. 9"". The disappointing aspects involve casting ""bit parts"" (newsman, police, wives) that often do not fly (or feel EXTREMELY dated), and in general the side of the prosecution; cops and all involved seem flat and clinical and do not have the same spark or believability as the Manson Family cast. Bugliosi is portayed adequately but it feels by the numbers in some areas.The picture is quite clean, considering the age, and while others here seem pleased with the sound quality, the 1ch just doesn't quite cut it. I suppose since this is a drama it is ""adequate"" but so much more could have been done. I only noticed the edits on my last viewing and am shocked at them. Not so much that they were edited HERE but that they were ever aired on TV to begin with. Since when was **** (starts with an S) ever able to be broadcast? I actually have no qualm about the edits, they are few and slight, what IS important is we get the whole movie and not the chopped up (excuse the pun) rebroadcast version that is apparently still in the VHS community. You get the full movie here, and quite cheap I might add.There is a decent A&E; special on serial killers floating around that features (the real) Manson, Krenwinkle, and Van Houten. Needless to say they all seem to be singing a different tune these days. There seems to be true remorse on the hearts of the two woman, sadly it may be too late for total redemption. It is difficult to judge the hearts of men, so I leave that to God and the conscience of the parol board.",5,A Buntline Special for your DVD player,1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,2788,"['have', 'viewed', 'movie', 'more', 'dozen', 'times', 'life', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'totally', 'fascinated', 'Manson', 'Family', 'crimes', 'commited', 'grandparents', 'had', 'book', 'back', '70', 'would', 'always', 'scare', '****less', 'looking', 'crime', 'scene', 'photos', 'idea', 'why', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'odd', 'connection', 'era', 'even', 'was', 'born', 'only', 'year', 'Tate/LaBianca', 'killings', 'often', 'shock', 'friends', 'family', 'intimate', 'details', 'names', 'dates', 'needless', 'say', ""'m"", 'great', 'parties', 'do', 'not', 'glorify', 'what', 'been', 'done', 'marvel', 'details', 'Even', 'gave', 'movie', 'FIVE', 'stars', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'means', 'however', 'light', 'being', 'Made', 'TV', 'movie', '1976', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'more', 'brutal', 'shocking', 'depiction', 'being', 'made', 'soundtrack', 'what', 'off', 'movie', 'only', 'chill.Charles', 'Manson', 'Susan', 'Atkins', 'Leslie', 'Van', 'Houten', 'portrayed', 'here', 'are', 'downright', 'frightening', 'actors', 'seem', 'have', 'risen', 'TV', 'pap', 'have', 'given', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'ever', 'TV', 'Movie', 'performances', 'Even', 'Manson', 'gang', 'not', 'trial', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Danny', 'DiCarlo', 'riveting', 'performance', 'not', 'forget', 'actor', 'who', 'Bugliosi', 'translate', 'Charlie', 'RevolAtion', 'No', '9', 'disappointing', 'aspects', 'involve', 'casting', 'bit', 'parts', 'newsman', 'police', 'wives', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'fly', 'feel', 'EXTREMELY', 'dated', 'general', 'side', 'prosecution', 'cops', 'involved', 'seem', 'flat', 'clinical', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'spark', 'believability', 'Manson', 'Family', 'cast', 'Bugliosi', 'portayed', 'adequately', 'numbers', 'areas.The', 'picture', 'quite', 'clean', 'considering', 'age', 'others', 'here', 'seem', 'pleased', 'sound', 'quality', '1ch', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'cut', 'suppose', 'drama', 'adequate', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'only', 'noticed', 'edits', 'last', 'viewing', 'am', 'shocked', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'were', 'edited', 'HERE', 'were', 'ever', 'aired', 'TV', 'begin', 'when', 'was', '****', 'S', 'ever', 'able', 'be', 'broadcast', 'actually', 'have', 'qualm', 'edits', 'are', 'few', 'slight', 'what', 'IS', 'important', 'get', 'whole', 'movie', 'not', 'chopped', 'up', 'pun', 'rebroadcast', 'version', 'apparently', 'still', 'VHS', 'community', 'get', 'full', 'movie', 'here', 'quite', 'cheap', 'might', 'add.There', 'decent', 'A', 'E', 'special', 'serial', 'killers', 'floating', 'features', 'real', 'Manson', 'Krenwinkle', 'Van', 'Houten', 'Needless', 'say', 'seem', 'be', 'singing', 'different', 'tune', 'days', 'be', 'true', 'remorse', 'hearts', 'two', 'woman', 'sadly', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'total', 'redemption', 'difficult', 'judge', 'hearts', 'men', 'leave', 'God', 'conscience', 'parol', 'board']",HELTER SKELTER (FF) (DVD)
