1018672,A9UH6I9GVQZU2,B000I2J6VY,"Low-Ranking Reviewer ""tell it like it is""","[4, 5]","This was one of my favorites as a kid, and to this day it still holds a special place in my martial arts film collection.  I though it was a colorful, fun, epic film then and it still holds up fairly well today.  The fighting is not that good or plentiful, even for an early 70's film it lacks in this area; and it's also mainly army vs army as opposed to individual kung fu fights.  If you watch this, the interest lies more in its story, characters, actors, situations, and pageantry rather than the martial arts action(but there is enough of that if you don't expect or demand wall-to-wall fights).However, the vhs version i saw as a kid was called SEVEN BLOWS OF THE DRAGON and featured(during the opening credits) a fantastic, rousing, catchy, asian-sounding theme music.  The opening credits to the uncut, original language version DOES NOT have that theme music.  To me, this aspect was VERY disappointing.  There is no option to hear that theme music anywhere on the disc.  I was really hoping to hear it on my theater system with digital quality.  In its place is music that sounds like some 70's progressive rock band got a hold of it and went off on the keyboards.  Needless to say my vhs version will be held onto.Anyway, the dvd is still worth picking up obviously.  You get the original uncut version in beautiful widescreen, english subtitles option, a couple of interviews and a featurette on the director.  Plus, almost 25 trailers(!) of other martial arts releases.  I got my dvd copy on sale at amazon for under $8, but the usual $13 asking price is worth it too.  Depends on how much you would miss that 'Seven Blows of the Dragon' theme i guess...",4,Where's the other opening credits theme music?,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,1668,"['was', 'one', 'favorites', 'kid', 'day', 'still', 'special', 'place', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'collection', 'was', 'colorful', 'fun', 'epic', 'film', 'then', 'still', 'up', 'fairly', 'well', 'today', 'fighting', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'plentiful', 'even', 'early', '70', 'film', 'area', 'also', 'mainly', 'army', 'vs', 'army', 'opposed', 'individual', 'kung', 'fu', 'fights', 'watch', 'interest', 'more', 'story', 'characters', 'actors', 'situations', 'pageantry', 'rather', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'demand', 'wall-to-wall', 'fights', '.However', 'vhs', 'version', 'i', 'saw', 'kid', 'was', 'called', 'SEVEN', 'BLOWS', 'THE', 'DRAGON', 'featured', 'opening', 'credits', 'fantastic', 'rousing', 'catchy', 'asian-sounding', 'theme', 'music', 'opening', 'credits', 'uncut', 'original', 'language', 'version', 'DOES', 'NOT', 'have', 'theme', 'music', 'aspect', 'was', 'VERY', 'disappointing', 'option', 'hear', 'theme', 'music', 'anywhere', 'disc', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'hear', 'theater', 'system', 'digital', 'quality', 'place', 'music', '70', 'progressive', 'rock', 'band', 'got', 'hold', 'went', 'keyboards', 'Needless', 'say', 'vhs', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'held', 'onto.Anyway', 'dvd', 'still', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'obviously', 'get', 'original', 'uncut', 'version', 'beautiful', 'widescreen', 'english', 'subtitles', 'option', 'couple', 'interviews', 'featurette', 'director', 'almost', '25', 'trailers', 'other', 'martial', 'arts', 'releases', 'got', 'dvd', 'copy', 'sale', 'amazon', '8', 'usual', '13', 'asking', 'price', 'too', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'miss', ""'Seven"", 'Blows', 'Dragon', 'theme', 'i', 'guess']",The Water Margin
1018673,APIW11UEPKIC2,B000I2J6VY,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[8, 10]","'The Water Margin' is a movie based on a famous Chinese novel.  This movie is taken from chapters of the book and made into a movie version from the great Chang Cheh.  It is really the 2 great Japanese actors that stand out in this movie for me.  One playing a lead and another is a supporting character.  Though they play Chinese characters it definately helped elavate this movie.  David Chiang I thought was miscast as the wrestler but he is still always great to watch.  Fan Mei-Sheng is funny and fun to watch playing the Black Whirwind.  Wang Chung was my favorite character by far.  Although this movie does not even come close to featuring some of the greatest action sequences ever but for 1972 it is not too bad.  The story can be a bit boring at times but the sets are great, the acting is superb, and even the stock music is very well applied.  The open field battle at the end is great for it's time and helps to finish off a very good movie.I am not Chinese and I have not read the book this is based on.  Still, it is very well done story, but I would only give this movie a 3.5/5.  If I had read the book, I have heard that this movie would be MUCH better.  I plan on seeing the sequel to this movie-'All Men Are Brothers' which I have heard features Bolo and Fan Mei wrestling.  That to me is a must see.This DVD release from Image Entertainment is great.  The subtitles are half way in the black bar on the bottom and half way in the movie.  Not a big distraction but the IVL version actually got this right and has the subs only in the black bars, the way it should have been presented.  Not a big deal though.  The movie is beautifully remastered in picture and sound though it does not have an English track.  Special Features include interviews with Ti Lung and David Chiang and a tribute to Chang Cheh.",4,Not  one of the greatest action movies but still very good,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,1825,"[""'The"", 'Water', 'Margin', 'movie', 'based', 'famous', 'Chinese', 'novel', 'movie', 'taken', 'chapters', 'book', 'made', 'movie', 'version', 'great', 'Chang', 'Cheh', 'really', '2', 'great', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'stand', 'out', 'movie', 'One', 'playing', 'lead', 'supporting', 'character', 'play', 'Chinese', 'characters', 'definately', 'helped', 'elavate', 'movie', 'David', 'Chiang', 'thought', 'was', 'miscast', 'wrestler', 'still', 'always', 'great', 'watch', 'Fan', 'Mei-Sheng', 'funny', 'fun', 'watch', 'playing', 'Black', 'Whirwind', 'Wang', 'Chung', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'far', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'featuring', 'greatest', 'action', 'sequences', 'ever', '1972', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'boring', 'times', 'sets', 'are', 'great', 'acting', 'superb', 'even', 'stock', 'music', 'very', 'well', 'applied', 'open', 'field', 'battle', 'end', 'great', 'time', 'finish', 'off', 'very', 'good', 'movie.I', 'am', 'not', 'Chinese', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'based', 'Still', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'story', 'would', 'only', 'give', 'movie', '3.5/5', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'have', 'heard', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'MUCH', 'better', 'plan', 'seeing', 'sequel', ""movie-'All"", 'Men', 'Are', 'Brothers', 'have', 'heard', 'features', 'Bolo', 'Fan', 'Mei', 'wrestling', 'must', 'see.This', 'DVD', 'release', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'great', 'subtitles', 'are', 'half', 'way', 'black', 'bar', 'bottom', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'Not', 'big', 'distraction', 'IVL', 'version', 'actually', 'got', 'right', 'subs', 'only', 'black', 'bars', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'remastered', 'picture', 'sound', 'not', 'have', 'English', 'track', 'Special', 'Features', 'include', 'interviews', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'David', 'Chiang', 'tribute', 'Chang', 'Cheh']",The Water Margin
