1591472,A3Q9ELF0U0ZRGY,B009AMAKBI,A. Gaster,"[3, 4]","This plot, acting, and dialogue was so bad that I spent more time laughing than caring.  It can be fun to laugh at a bad movie, but in this case, after laughing for a while, I felt sorry for the effort the actors and film makers wasted.  It seems to me that you have to care about at least one person in a story to value the yarn.....this writer must not have known that.  It is obvious that we are supposed to care about the young college dropout (actually expelled), but why should we?  He falls for a trashy woman.  He uses the ""N"" word. He has no purpose in life except to get his trashy blond away from her convict boyfriend and the rest of her ""anybody, anytime"" lovers.  The story teller tells us that this extremely handsome boy and college swimming star never had a real girlfriend until he fell for his trashy piece of fluff.  Give me a break. This boy would have had dozens of girlfriends in high school and college, and believability still counts for something, doesn't it? I kept watching because I thought the plot would have some great twists and turns that make up a good mystery.  I was wrong.  Actually, the first half of the movie was not too bad, mainly because I kept thinking, ""Oh, boy, they are setting up for a really great mystery plot that could surprise us at every turn"", but the middle moves so slowly that I started fast-forwarding occasionally toward the end, and there were no surprises. It's like they let a good writer begin the story and then turned it over to an unimaginative hack to finish it.  Also the sound was terrible, with people muttering half the time, echoes, and whispers that I only was able to understand about half of the dialogue...not that the movie would have been any better if one could understand every word.  What could have saved this waste of time was a better plot.  Already boring and dull, they film makers stretched it out to an hour and forty-five minutes to make it more boring and dull.  I bet the theater owners sold a lot of popcorn.  When anything is this tiresome, there is not much else to do except head for the lobby and hang out at the video machines with your popcorn and drink. I have a suggestion for whomever bankrolled this bomb....see ""Blue Velvet"" and learn why a film of this type becomes a cult classic before you waste your money again.",1,Down Right Silly,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,2321,"['plot', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'laughing', 'caring', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'laugh', 'bad', 'movie', 'case', 'laughing', 'while', 'felt', 'sorry', 'effort', 'actors', 'film', 'makers', 'wasted', 'have', 'care', 'about', 'least', 'one', 'person', 'story', 'value', 'yarn', '..this', 'writer', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'obvious', 'are', 'supposed', 'care', 'young', 'college', 'dropout', 'actually', 'expelled', 'why', 'should', 'trashy', 'woman', 'N', 'word', 'purpose', 'life', 'get', 'trashy', 'blond', 'away', 'convict', 'boyfriend', 'rest', 'anybody', 'anytime', 'lovers', 'story', 'teller', 'extremely', 'handsome', 'boy', 'college', 'swimming', 'star', 'never', 'had', 'real', 'girlfriend', 'fell', 'trashy', 'piece', 'fluff', 'Give', 'break', 'boy', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'dozens', 'girlfriends', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'believability', 'still', 'something', ""n't"", 'kept', 'watching', 'thought', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'great', 'twists', 'make', 'up', 'good', 'mystery', 'was', 'wrong', 'Actually', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'mainly', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Oh', 'boy', 'are', 'setting', 'up', 'really', 'great', 'mystery', 'plot', 'could', 'surprise', 'turn', 'middle', 'moves', 'so', 'slowly', 'started', 'fast-forwarding', 'occasionally', 'end', 'were', 'surprises', 'let', 'good', 'writer', 'begin', 'story', 'then', 'turned', 'over', 'unimaginative', 'hack', 'finish', 'Also', 'sound', 'was', 'terrible', 'people', 'muttering', 'time', 'echoes', 'whispers', 'only', 'was', 'able', 'understand', 'half', 'dialogue', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'one', 'could', 'understand', 'word', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'waste', 'time', 'was', 'better', 'plot', 'Already', 'boring', 'dull', 'film', 'makers', 'stretched', 'out', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'make', 'more', 'boring', 'dull', 'bet', 'theater', 'owners', 'sold', 'lot', 'popcorn', 'When', 'anything', 'tiresome', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'do', 'head', 'lobby', 'hang', 'out', 'video', 'machines', 'popcorn', 'drink', 'have', 'suggestion', 'whomever', 'bankrolled', 'bomb', '.see', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'learn', 'why', 'film', 'type', 'cult', 'classic', 'waste', 'money', 'again']",The Paperboy
1591473,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B009AMAKBI,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","When `The Paperboy' showed at Cannes last year there was a lot of hoopla about how bad it was.  I mean, it was trashed for being trashy and basically considered one of the worst films in recent memory.  A lot of hype was brought to the table before it showed (Lee Daniels followup to his Oscar vehicle `Precious') and even afterward (Nicole Kidman pees on Zac Efron) and basically what was considered total trash became one of those movies that everyone HAD TO SEE, even though they were pretty much guaranteed that they would hate it.I didn't hate this.I want to start by saying that this movie is really very bad.  Nothing about it works separately and yet together it all works in this `so bad I can't help but be entertained by it' kind of way.  The accent work is awful (Efron can't hold an accent and McConaughey doesn't even try), the basic storyline is a confused mess (I've never seen a film that tried so hard to shove so much into one narrative) and the direction is a shoddy mess.  Still, I can't say that I hated this because despite the fact that it shouldn't work, it kind of does.The basic plot follows a young paperboy named Jack living in Florida during the 60's.  His brother Ward is a journalist for a newspaper trying to dig up evidence to prove the innocence of a man named Hillary Van Wetter, who is on death row for killing a sheriff.  While in prison, Hillary started writing back and forth with Charlotte Bless, a simple minded southern tramp who has a thing for criminals.  She's convinced he's innocent (for strange reasons) and she tries to help Ward prove that.  In the meantime, young Jack is falling in love with Charlotte.  She represents everything he's lost over the years and in her he finds some sort of solace.`The Paperboy' becomes messy because it can never establish a clear focal point.  At the core of the film is supposedly this murder case, and yet there really seems to be no interest in it at all.  It becomes background fodder for the love triangle forming between Hillary, Charlotte and Jack and yet, even at that Hillary becomes this side point with no real depth and so it becomes the Jack and Charlotte show.  Still, there is no real character development between them and their relationship seems like a gimmick more than anything else; simply a springboard for bizarre behavior and scenes of awkwardly stylized thoughts.  Then you have Ward and his partner Yardley and the underdeveloped semblance of the Jensen parents (father and step mother) and their housekeeper Anita, who appears to have a real impact on Jack and yet feels like more of a symbol than an actual character.  Yardley is treated like a villain and never really given depth and Ward's decline is supposed to have some significance and yet it is entirely wrapped up in the murder case, which by about thirty minutes in we've already forgotten all about.  With all the themes here none of them come to completion and so it is basically about a lot of things and nothing all at the same time.Lee Daniels once again proves to be the worst thing about his films (he misdirected `Precious' and really was in no way shape or form the reason for its success).The acting here is spotty.  Matthew McConaughey plays himself once again and John Cusack really needs a shower.  I used to think he was a good actor, but he tries WAY TOO HARD here.  Zac Efron does nothing of merit outside of botch an accent.  Kidman, Gray and Oyelowo are best in show for varying reasons (and none is without detractors either).  Oyelowo has a very underdeveloped character and yet he tries to insert a backstory and manages to do that to a certain degree.  Gray is the heart of the story (she narrates) and she does keep it together for the most part.  She doesn't really have a character and yet she manages to be a life-force, so for that she should be singled out.  Kidman got the bulk of the attention (good and bad) for her fearless portrayal of a woman gone crazy.  Her sexualized meeting with Hillary was ridiculous and incredible at the same time.  She is polarizing because so much of what she does is SO EXTREME and yet in the context of this crazy film it almost works SO WELL.At the end of the day, this film is really, truly bad.  It is bad because Lee Daniels has no idea how to tell a story.  He has so many ideas and `cool tricks' that he thinks he's saying more than he is or showing us more than he is and yet at the end of the day his films say so much less than they should because he lacks focus and his `style' sacrifices `substance' and winds up creating an empty feeling in the pit of his films.  Still, the gritty 80's style porno screen shots make this interesting and the wildly uneven trashiness make `The Paperboy' nothing less than entertaining.",3,So bad it's kind of good?,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,4767,"['When', 'Paperboy', 'showed', 'Cannes', 'last', 'year', 'there', 'was', 'lot', 'hoopla', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'mean', 'was', 'trashed', 'being', 'trashy', 'basically', 'considered', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'lot', 'hype', 'was', 'brought', 'table', 'showed', 'Lee', 'Daniels', 'followup', 'Oscar', 'vehicle', 'Precious', 'even', 'afterward', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'basically', 'what', 'was', 'considered', 'total', 'trash', 'became', 'one', 'movies', 'everyone', 'HAD', 'TO', 'SEE', 'even', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'guaranteed', 'would', 'hate', 'it.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'this.I', 'want', 'start', 'saying', 'movie', 'really', 'very', 'bad', 'Nothing', 'separately', 'yet', 'together', 'so', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'entertained', 'kind', 'way', 'accent', 'work', 'awful', 'Efron', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'accent', 'McConaughey', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'basic', 'storyline', 'confused', 'mess', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'shove', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'narrative', 'direction', 'shoddy', 'mess', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'hated', 'fact', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'kind', 'does.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'young', 'paperboy', 'named', 'Jack', 'living', 'Florida', '60', 'brother', 'Ward', 'journalist', 'newspaper', 'trying', 'dig', 'up', 'evidence', 'prove', 'innocence', 'man', 'named', 'Hillary', 'Van', 'Wetter', 'who', 'death', 'row', 'killing', 'sheriff', 'prison', 'Hillary', 'started', 'writing', 'back', 'forth', 'Charlotte', 'Bless', 'simple', 'minded', 'southern', 'tramp', 'who', 'thing', 'criminals', 'convinced', 'innocent', 'strange', 'reasons', 'help', 'Ward', 'prove', 'meantime', 'young', 'Jack', 'falling', 'love', 'Charlotte', 'everything', 'lost', 'years', 'sort', 'solace.', 'Paperboy', 'becomes', 'messy', 'can', 'never', 'establish', 'clear', 'focal', 'point', 'core', 'film', 'supposedly', 'murder', 'case', 'yet', 'really', 'be', 'interest', 'background', 'fodder', 'love', 'triangle', 'forming', 'Hillary', 'Charlotte', 'Jack', 'yet', 'even', 'Hillary', 'side', 'point', 'real', 'depth', 'Jack', 'Charlotte', 'show', 'Still', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'relationship', 'gimmick', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'simply', 'springboard', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'scenes', 'awkwardly', 'stylized', 'thoughts', 'Then', 'have', 'Ward', 'partner', 'Yardley', 'underdeveloped', 'semblance', 'Jensen', 'parents', 'father', 'step', 'mother', 'housekeeper', 'Anita', 'who', 'have', 'real', 'impact', 'Jack', 'yet', 'feels', 'more', 'symbol', 'actual', 'character', 'Yardley', 'treated', 'villain', 'never', 'really', 'given', 'depth', 'Ward', 'decline', 'supposed', 'have', 'significance', 'yet', 'entirely', 'wrapped', 'up', 'murder', 'case', 'thirty', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'already', 'forgotten', 'themes', 'here', 'none', 'come', 'completion', 'basically', 'lot', 'things', 'nothing', 'same', 'time.Lee', 'Daniels', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'worst', 'thing', 'films', 'misdirected', 'Precious', 'really', 'was', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'reason', 'success', '.The', 'acting', 'here', 'spotty', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'once', 'again', 'John', 'Cusack', 'really', 'shower', 'used', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'actor', 'WAY', 'TOO', 'HARD', 'here', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'nothing', 'merit', 'botch', 'accent', 'Kidman', 'Gray', 'Oyelowo', 'are', 'best', 'show', 'varying', 'reasons', 'none', 'detractors', 'Oyelowo', 'very', 'underdeveloped', 'character', 'yet', 'insert', 'backstory', 'manages', 'do', 'certain', 'degree', 'Gray', 'heart', 'story', 'keep', 'together', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'character', 'yet', 'be', 'life-force', 'so', 'should', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'Kidman', 'got', 'bulk', 'attention', 'good', 'bad', 'fearless', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'gone', 'crazy', 'sexualized', 'meeting', 'Hillary', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'incredible', 'same', 'time', 'polarizing', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'SO', 'EXTREME', 'yet', 'context', 'crazy', 'film', 'almost', 'SO', 'WELL.At', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'really', 'truly', 'bad', 'bad', 'Lee', 'Daniels', 'idea', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'ideas', 'cool', 'tricks', 'saying', 'more', 'showing', 'more', 'yet', 'end', 'day', 'films', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'should', 'focus', 'style', 'sacrifices', 'substance', 'up', 'creating', 'empty', 'feeling', 'pit', 'films', 'Still', 'gritty', '80', 'style', 'porno', 'screen', 'shots', 'make', 'interesting', 'wildly', 'uneven', 'trashiness', 'make', 'Paperboy', 'nothing', 'less', 'entertaining']",The Paperboy

1591493,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B009AMAKBI,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 2]","After viewing ""The Paperboy,"" Lee Daniels' feverish 2012 film, I wasn't sure what I had seen. All I knew was I did not want to see it again. To call this film trashy is doing it a favor. ""The Paperboy"" is not just repulsive, it's an especially virulent flu combining the worst of William Friedkin withPink Flamingos. It is Southern Gothic grotesque with overlapping dialogue, illogical editing and indulgent forays. There's a tendency to overrate this film because it's so bad, as if Daniels was aggressively strolling through the kitsch realm of Todd Haynes' Barbie dolls.Daniels captured lightning in a bottle with his 2009 workPrecious, a dark, sometimes equally disturbing tale about a black woman insisting upon respectability after years of abuse. It was some kind of brilliant work. Let's compare Daniels to Woody Allen or Spike Lee. Both men have crafted two of the greatest careers in film history, almost always detailing personal life experience. Equally important, they learned the craft and earned the ability for experimental excursions. WhileMiracle At St. Annais not Lee's best film, andInteriorsis not Allen's most assured work, they are still fascinating products of great directors stretching their talents.With respect, Daniels has not earned the right to force us to sit through such indulgence. ""The Paperboy"" is a pulpy, sweaty mess which should have more to offer. When Daniels, an African-American man, wades through areas of personal experience such as the character of Anita, the maid of the protagonists in this film and wonderfully played by Macy Gray, you can see his unique talent. Otherwise, it's as if Daniels was bored with the substandard material and tried to obsessively inject artistically campy strokes. He's lost in a swamp.Based on a novel by Pete Dexter (The Paperboy), the film takes place in small town Florida of 1969. College dropout Jack Jansen (Zac Efron, too old for this role), hangs at the family house wearing Fruit of the Loom briefs. His dad (Scott Glenn), adorned in a Civil War haircut, runs the local newspaper. Jack's big brother Ward (Matthew McConaughey) returns home as a reporter from the Miami daily with co-writer Yardley (David Oyelowo), a London-bred black man, in tow. They are going to expose the conviction of swamp thing Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack), lounging on death row for the murder of a local sheriff. It appears he was railroaded. He's got a sexy penpal in Charlotte (Nicole Kidman), a trailer park siren with clacking heels, who wants to marry him upon his release. Poor Jack, with doughy, first-love eyes, lusts after Charlotte.Where the film goes is not particularly shocking, though multiple scenes are injected for shock value. Daniels gives us graphic demonstrations of public masturbation, animal mutilation, sadism, incest and murder. I am not making this up. Character development and dialogue have been shunted to the side while actors speak in a hazy whisper, eyes at half mast, as confused as if they just gulped a fistful of quaaludes. Scenes fade out at key moments, and loud breezes and sighs trample crucial dialogue.One specific scene ranks as one of the most ridiculous of recent memory. A key character is hog-tied with chains on the floor of a motel room. He's been beaten senseless, lying on a sheet of plastic covered in blood. This ""stylish"" scene was not in the novel and entirely created by Daniels. So here's my frustration. You mean to tell me Daniels was given a considerable wad of money by a movie studio for the privilege of making a major film with some of the great actors of his generation, and the best he could come up with was S&M; in a pink motel?I don't have a problem with boundaries being stretched, and walked out ofBlue VelvetandHarold and Maudeknowing full well I had seen a masterpiece.

1591502,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B009AMAKBI,C. Sawin,"[8, 14]","Ask just about anyone about ""The Paperboy"" and they'll reply with something along the lines of, ""Isn't that that movie where Nicole Kidman pees on Zac Efron?"" It's funny because that seemed to be the only thing anyone knew about the film going into it. What's peculiar about ""The Paperboy"" is that it's difficult to pinpoint just what type of genre it is. There are comedic elements in there, it's very dramatic at times and really thrilling at others, and the ending is incredibly dark and unexpected. Unfortunately the film doesn't always hit its mark. In fact, it doesn't even hit the target at all at times.Just about every character introduced in the film is sex hungry. Add that to the white trash atmosphere and humor and it's a little overwhelming. Some will find it hysterical, but it's incredibly cheesy more often than not. Whether it's Jack complaining that his dad's maid Anita (Macy Gray) didn't knock before entering his room because he may have been jerking off, Jack and Yardley's obsession with having sex with Charlotte, or Anita's trashy voiceover that guides you through the events of the film that comes off more obnoxious than amusing, the film is constantly jumping all over the place except when it comes to its humor or sexual devotion.Things begin to get really ludicrous once everyone starts visiting the prison to see Hillary. Charlotte claims to get horny in Jack's car because of ""good vibrations"" while their first meeting with Hillary is just absolutely preposterous; Charlotte and Hillary basically orgasm without ever touching each other. It seems like the film wastes so much time with kinky scenes and silly dialogue.Some of the performances are really impressive though. Matthew McConaughey continues the dark streak he started with ""Killer Joe"" here as Ward has this demented side to him that's pretty shocking. He has this scene in his apartment where he's too drunk to function properly and is yelling memories of their mother to Zac Efron from the shower that's both haunting and kind of depressing. David Oyelowo also puts in a strong performance. Yardley's true motives make him an absolutely despicable character and Oyelowo does an impeccable job bringing those characteristics to life. Many of the characters seem to have this different side to them that they hide from the rest of the world; everyone except Hillary Van Wetter. He's not only as messed up as everyone thinks, but even more deranged than anyone can imagine. It's one of the most unusual roles John Cusack has ever portrayed.The way the film is edited is incredibly distracting. Shots are constantly bleeding into others while many scenes begin out of focus and jump around the room before finally settling on the scene at hand. The first few times this is done, it seems like an artistic endeavor. But once you realize that's the way the entire film is edited, it feels amateurish at best and its execution absolutely takes away from whatever the film did have to offer.The screenplay comes off like it's purposely trying to be awful and the film's inability to pick a genre and stick with it seems to hurt it more often than not. At the same time though, the majority of the performances are very strong and everything is certainly unpredictable. The humor is where the film may lose you though.

Disappointing!  The actors do their best to overcome the weak script(Dexter & Daniels), but it's a no-win situation.  Bad sound mixing insures that much dialogue is missed, which doesn't help one following the characterizations.  The writers decided that the film needed a couple of major black characters added(Macy Gray & David Oyelowo) and made the McConaughey character gay - and neither additions are handled with any subtlety(I'll leave it at that).  When director Almodovar bailed, did Mr.Daniels take over with the understanding of 'tackling the BIG issues'?  Who knows.  I'm a huge fan of foreign films, new and old, so I'm pretty adept at snaking my way thru a demanding film.  But this one is just poorly constructed; from the screenplay to the direction.  Besides watching the actors struggle to overcome the material, the photography and music are the only things I can recommend.  There are also several unsavory scenes, that are not really needed for advancing the story, which many folks are going to find offensive.  The director seems intent on making an artsy/statement film out of what is basically a thriller/who-dunit/Southern Gothic genre.  The author would be better served to insist on writing the screenplay without any interference, and to adhere to the major plot lines of his own material.  One might get a perverse kick from hooting at the preposterous plot, dialog, and scenes(if that's any benefit).

1591515,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B009AMAKBI,Doug Anderson,"[3, 4]","This film (shot in New Orleans but set in a fictitious Northern Florida town called Lately) has everything you want from southern gothic c. 1969: a small ""Last Picture Show"" hotbox of a town (but in color) where everything glistens with guilt and shame and desire and where sin seems to be the only viable vocation/pastime; an omnipresent and everpresent indifference to justice regulated by a sadistic Welles-ian sheriff who thrives on squelching/thwarting things like young desire and hope and change; a psychotic swamp billy accused of killing the sheriff; a hothouse vamp infatuated/obsessed with every lurid/pulpy detail of the psychotic swamp billy's story; a young motherless college boy in love with the hothouse flower; and a black maid with a nurturing heart and a fondness for southern cooking and narrative. Its also got two Miami reporters (one white, one black), each with a flair for the melodramatic, one a Sidney Poiter wannabe on the prowl for a sensationalistic potboiler that will hook him a Pulitzer, the other a Truman Capote wannabe on the prowl for some New Journalistic truth, but in all of this sweltering mess the former's a lot easier to come by than the latter. And thats the essentail focus of this film: what kinds of truths do we craft for ourslves, what kinds of truths do we settle for, and how much do we care (and what are the costs) if those truths are accurate or not.The Paperboy oozes with racial and sexual tension and the desire for some cathartic sex or violence drips out of every one of its tortured pores but it casts no judgements nor promises any form of redemption for any one of its lonely band of dysfuntional hunters, so the film is not going to please anyone looking for your typical Hollywood characters and story. This is a different kind of tale and it makes its appeal in its own kind of way. I've heard others describe The Paperboy as ""campy"" but that is misleading because that implies that the film does not take its characters and subject matter seriously when in fact it does. And what it takes most seriously is the twisted forms that desire takes. Its blend of political and amorous and narrative idealism and corruption will remind viewers of everything from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to The Graduate.With this many characters its impossible to tell just one story -- our interest is spread over several plot threads throughout -- but the main story (the one that unites them all, somewhat) is set in motion by Charlotte Bless (Nicole Kidman) who is convinced that her jailhouse penpal Hillary Van Wetten (John Cusak) is innocent of the crime that he now sits on death row for committing. Its her letter that brings the Miami journalists Ward Jansen (Matthew McConaughey) and Yardley Acheman (David Oyelowo) to town. Jansen is an ex-resident of Lately, Fla. so when he arrives in town he sets up an ad hoc newspaper office in his dad's (also a newspaperman) garage. His younger brother, Jack Jansen (Zac Efron), has been kicked out of college and off of the swim team, so he is hired as their  driver. Jack's only companion in life is his maid, Anita (Macy Gray) and their peculiar friendship (she is a kind of a surrogate mother/confidante) is one of the most intriguing of the many intriguing narrative threads here. In fact its her voice that we hear telling this story (or at least the part of it that involves Jack's first love/coming-of-age). Viewers might be confused as to what they are supposed to pay attention to or whose story is most important or what kind of story/film this is (southern noir, coming-of-age story, love story) but thats what is so original about this film: everyone's story is equally important and intriguing and no one's story gets singled out--instead they all complement and comment on each other. The interesting thing about this approach to storytelling is that you feel like you are in completely new narrative terrain (a kind of hybrid terrain where William Faulkner meets Tennessee Williams and then they both run into Jim Thompson).The newspaper team (Charlotte, Ward, Yardley, and Jack) divide their time between the garage that is chock-full of political artifacts from other long-dead or merely exausted political (as well as literary) eras, and the prison, where they interview the eerie and lascivious Hillary (who up until now Charlotte only knows through their written correpondence). Charlotte is convinced that Hillary is innocent even though he is as creepy as they come. She seems to see something in him and so the others try to see it too, but hes a hard one to read or define. But then, as the film progresses, it becomes quite clear that none of these characters are easy to read or define. Surprise follows surprise and each plot and character twist makes it harder and harder to be certain of anyone or anything. And that is the thrill of this film. Negative reviews make the film sound like it was sloppily made, but the confusion and doubt cast in the viewer's mind as to who is who and what really happened is intentional and purposeful, and the director doesn't want to clean the mess up for you, or simplify or sugar coat any of it. He wants to leave it messy and complicated. And thats what the film is: messy, complicated, innocent, corrupt, sick, touching (and all by design). And what a design it is.",4,Literate and Perverse Southern Noir/Hothouse Potboiler,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,5328,"['film', 'shot', 'New', 'Orleans', 'set', 'fictitious', 'Northern', 'Florida',

1591525,A3JXBZ8F65100O,B009AMAKBI,Ferdy,"[1, 2]","The basic premise of this movie is that a woman, Nicole Kidman, who has fallen in love with a prisoner, John Cusack, has enlisted the aid of a couple of reporters to help her clear her sweetheart's name because he was wrongly convicted.  Then, she can get him out of prison so that they can get married.  This all takes place in Florida in the 1960's. Matthew McConaughey plays the reporter who returns to his backwater home town with his ""colleague"" an African American journalist.  Zack Efron plays the younger brother of the reporter.  The story takes all sorts of twists and turns to get anywhere and when things finally do start happening, I found myself just sort of sitting and scratching my head thinking, ""What is going on?""  I will say that Nicole Kidman does a superb acting job here.  She plays a trailer park trashy blonde bombshell sex pot and does it very convincingly.  John Cusack, who plays the ruthless convict, also surprised me.  The roles for both these actors was such a departure from the types of characters they usually play and  yet both made it seem effortless.  Macy Gray plays the part of the family's  maid and was a surprisingly good actress as well.  I think there were just too many stories going on here so there's never one clear direction so despite some outstanding acting, the film overall just doesn't hold together.  There was also, in my opinion, too much unnecessarily graphic sexuality including a masturbation scene from Nicole Kidman that could almost qualify as soft porn.  That was just another jarring note that didn't seem to fit into the fabric of the story for me.  I can't say I enthusiastically recommend it as a great movie but it is at least interesting for the most part.  It is almost worth the cost of the rental just to see the performance of Nicole Kidman.

Also contributing to the screenplay is openly gay Director Lee Daniels, best known for his work on Precious and Monster's Ball.  Combine these two talents and out comes THE PAPERBOY, a story with so much on its agenda that it keeps the viewer head-scratching.THE PAPERBOY is told through the narration of a housemaid Anita (Macy Gray) that sets a tone for the dark tale that follows. The setting is Florida in 1969 in a Podunk town where two brothers Ward Jansen (Matthew McCounaghey) and Jack Jansen (Zac Efron) work in the town's newspaper run by their father (Scott Glenn): Jack is an ex-champion swimmer whose fallen on bad times and Ward is a gay reporter who returns to the town with his boyfriend Yardley Acheman (David Oyelowo) to help a trashy woman Charlotte Bless (Nicole Kidman) who is habituated to distant love affairs with men in the penitentiary to release an innocent prisoner Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack) from jail with whom she exchanges letters, after he was convicted of the killing of a sheriff, and now awaiting his execution. While the investigation goes on course, the young Jack is hopelessly in love by the much older Charlotte, and nothing is what is seems as things progress between both the panorama of skewed relationships and between the leads found about the night of the sheriff's murder and the alleged criminal alibi.The film takes us through racial epithets, a sadomasochistic sexual encounter between Ward and some black hustlers, a lot of bizarre frank physical behavior and coarse sexual encounters, bigotry/racism, swamp derring-do including the evisceration of an alligator - all of which somehow fit well into the mood that Director Daniels wants to convey his story.  There are exceptional performances from Kidman, Efron (who is developing into a very fine young actor), McCounaghey (in a new type of role for the lady killer), Cusack (believably smarmy and psychotic), and Macy Gray. The supporting cast is also consistently fine.  These attributes keep the somewhat loosely pasted together story in line. It is a brutally realistic film and not for the feint of heart.

1591540,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B009AMAKBI,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[12, 14]","Lee Daniels has made two films prior to this; SHADOWBOXER with Stephen Dorff (which I have not seen) and the fine PRECIOUS. PRECIOUS garnered a number of awards for the cast and an Independent Spirit award for Daniels as director. With such a strong sophomore effort, he was able to assemble the likes of Nicole Kidman, Matthew McConaughey, John Cusack and David Oyelowo as well as the questionable acting talents of Zac Efron and Macy Gray (?) for the Southern Gothic-style mystery/drama THE PAPERBOY. The film had gained controversy early on in its reviews about a scene where Kidman's character has to urinate on Efron's character after being stung by jellyfish.The reviews also failed to mention that the film also tends to relieve itself on the audience, resulting in a disgusting, smelly mess of narrative, hopelessly deficient storytelling and some of these actors' worst performances to date.THE PAPERBOY takes place in the late 1960's in rural Florida. A racist sheriff is killed, and imprisoned and to be executed for the crime is Hillary Van Wetter (Cusack), a volatile backwater scumbag. Crusading reporters Wade (McConaughey) and Yardley (Oyelowo) visit Wade's hometown where his father (Scott Glenn), his younger brother Jack (Efron) and father's maid Anita (Gray) live to open their own investigation into the murderer to hopefully get Hillary acquitted for a crime he seems to be wrongly convicted of. Along for the ride is the seemingly professional and hyper-sexual prisoner pen-pal Charlotte (Kidman), who professes her love for Hillary in a series of letters. This leads to all sorts of discomfort as Jack falls madly in love with Charlotte, despite her engagement to Hillary, and how she also may have slept with Yardley (who has secrets of his own) to help produce false information that may lead to Hillary's exoneration. This leads Ward and Jack to confront certain truths of their own and to an inevitable confrontation with Hillary in his swamp home.As I was watching this film, I kept telling myself, ""This HAS to get better soon"". With Kidman's 60's spray-tan and wigs and Cusack's absurd hair and accent and just the absolute contempt this film seems to have for its characters (and the audience, apparently), it is almost entirely unwatchable. I don't mind films filled with unlikable characters; I happen to think that William Friedkin's KILLER JOE (a BRILLIANT southern-fried noir, also starring McConaughey) was a work of genius and it's populated by people you wouldn't urinate on if their heads were on fire. But with that film, it seemed that Friedkin seemed to have some affection for those characters, and here with THE PAPERBOY, it seems like Daniels is actively trying to get you to hate all of these characters. Aside from Jack and Wade and Anita, all of the other characters are just detestable, and instead of just allowing you to make your own judgments, Daniels shoves it down your throat just how awful these human beings are. His directorial style makes no sense whatsoever other than to serve as a pretentious psuedo-throwback to 60's and 70's era filmmaking (split-screens, composite visuals, forced juxtaposition), and it just serves to throw this film deeper into unwatchability.And these actors give, collectively, some of the worst performances of their careers. McConaughey is the pretty much the only non-tragedy here, since his character seems to be the only one that has layers, and he gives it the best he can. Kidman seems like she studied her character by watching episodes of Jerry Springer, and decided she could best play her character as an antithesis of her own persona, and plays it straight, while doing things and saying lines that literally make your jaw drop (just as she literally does in easily the most absurd scene of the film). Efron just has zero screen presence; even though the film is apparently about him, he seems like he's not even there. Oweloyo has the practiced air of superiority in his portrayal that made him such a convincing villain in RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, but here, it's just obnoxious. Gray, who also pulls duty as the narrator of the film, is actually decent, but it's a very cliched role (the sassy, wise, yet lovable maid), which is not her fault. The worst of the lot is sadly John Cusack, who has had his worst screen year ever, with this film and also THE RAVEN, another contender for the worst of 2012. He seems like he's trying to ape Nicolas Cage with the hair and the bad accent and the wild-eyed performance, but he fails on every conceivable level. They could have literally cast anyone they wanted, and it probably wouldn't have made a difference.The worst part of this whole film is that there seems to be no theme; it's a mish-mash of different film conventions that mix together to make something so insulting to the viewer that it might just fool them into thinking this is great high-art cinema, calling to mind the axiom ""Well, if I don't understand it, it must be great"". It's not. THE PAPERBOY is certainly one of the worst possible ways to spend two hours (more like three, considering all the times you'll pause it to hear your brain screaming at you), and it takes the award for worst film of 2012.",1,"Shockingly, the worst film of 2012.",1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,5225,"['Lee', 'Daniels', 'made', 'two', 'films', 'prior', 'SHADOWBOXER', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'have', 'not',

Why do we need to watch Nicole Kidman pee on someone...or pleasure herself in front of a prison cell...Or see Matthew McConnaughey postioned for a rape scene? Maybe one of these things, but not all of them, with more to boot.  Also, in addition to a poor script and editing, the acting is bad and often comes off campy and unbelievable in many scenes.  This in spite of a top-notch cast which includes Nicole Kidman and John Cusack. Nicole Kidman's accent is all over the place.  She is supposed to be Southern, but sometimes almost reverts to her native Australian accent, then back to Southern; other times flat as if she's Midwestern.  An unrelated note:  The movie obviously takes place in the 60's, but much of the music is 70's disco, which is an anachronism....which tells me that the makers of the movie can't edit OR research the history of different eras thoroughly enough.",1,What A Mess.....,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,1234,"['Wow', 'film', 'mess', 'What', 'was', 'aim', 'here', 'Cutting', 'edge', 'risque', 'camp', 'above', 'movie', 'so', 'focused', 'being', 'over-the-top', 'shocking', 'perverted', 'even', 'have', 'plot', 'What', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'wikipedia', 'page', ""'ll"", 'be', 'lost', 'plodding', 'pace', 'nonsensical', 'editing', 'Why', 'do', 'need', 'watch', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'pee', 'someone', 'pleasure', 'front', 'prison', 'cell', 'see', 'Matthew', 'McConnaughey', 'postioned', 'rape', 'scene', 'Maybe', 'one', 'things', 'not', 'more', 'boot', 'Also', 'addition', 'poor', 'script', 'editing', 'acting', 'bad', 'often', 'off', 'campy', 'unbelievable', 'many', 'scenes', 'spite', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'accent', 'place', 'supposed', 'be', 'Southern', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'native', 'Australian', 'accent', 'then', 'back', 'Southern', 'other', 'times', 'flat', 'Midwestern', 'unrelated', 'note', 'movie', 'obviously', 'place', '60', 'much', 'music', '70', 'disco', 'anachronism', '.which', 'tells', 'makers', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'edit', 'OR', 'research', 'history', 'different', 'eras', 'thoroughly', 'enough']",The Paperboy

Though his first two films (the bizarre Shadowboxer and the extremely well-acted Precious) had their merits, only with The Paperboy do we finally see the maturation of his craft, the arrival of a distinct new voice. It is a hypnotically bold, daringly original, and utterly fearless film that seemingly effortlessly dances between drama and comedy, tenderness and tension, completely unafraid to go to shocking, dangerous places. It feels totally unpredictable, and nothing about it feels safe, which is something far too many movies are these days. The Paperboy hearkens back to the audacious spirit of American cinema in the 1970s, when filmmakers weren't afraid to make outrageous works like Deliverance and Prime Cut. In this film's world, nothing is sacred, and because Daniels is so assured with this approach, so completely in control of every moment, watching it is an enthralling, absorbing, exhilarating experience.Rarely am I so entertained and captivated by a film, and even more rarely am I so blown away by a film's originality and daring. With The Paperboy, Lee Daniels created a world I didn't want to leave and a film I didn't want to end.

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[11, 13]","Spoiler alert: a couple of scenes as a warning of film contentBe forewarned: ""The Paperboy"" is not an easy film to watch. However, each actor turns in surprisingly riveting  performances as the flawed characters they portray, making the film both gruesome and rewarding.It seems that Matthew McConaughey has something to prove after being named ""Sexiest Man Alive"" by People magazine a few years ago. He apparently wants to burst his iconic pretty boy image which he surely does in this film. I declare, he has one of the most repulsive scenes in film history (my opinion) during and after a homosexual encounter. It's an image not soon forgotten and to his utmost credit that he would film it. His entire performance is riveting. (He also plays another image-buster in ""Killer Joe,"" another truly horrific movie.)The most shocking acting is by John Cusack, a usually mild-mannered actor. Not here. No sirreee. I had to read the credits to learn the actor's name. John Cusack? No way, but, yes, he is outstanding as a brutal, sex-crazed sociopath. The object of his ""passion"" is Nicole Kidman, who, once again, shocks with the habitation of the role she plays. Kidman disappears into the role of this woman weary of broken relationships and seeking love from a prison inmate. He takes her to the swamp and all its symbolic meanings.It is McConaughey's role as reporter to gather evidence to get Cusack's character freed. The problem is, well, you can guess it in a world gone seriously awry. This unwarranted freedom sets into motion some very irreversible and evil consequences. Themes abound.Perhaps the most surprising performance of all is from Zac Efron.

Surprisingly, a fine cast of A-Listers pull no punches in this steamy portrayal of redneck racism, sex and violence.Set in swampy Florida of the 1960's, a well renowned Miami newspaper reporter returns to the small town where he grew up to look into the case against a convicted killer sitting on death row.  Ward (Matthew McConaughey) is the son of the local newspaper publisher (Scott Glenn) and brother of Jack (Zac Efron).  Accompanying Ward is a black-but-British-so-it's-OK writing partner (David Oyelowo).  One of the conflicts in Hillary Van Wetter's (John Cusack) conviction is that a cousin did not testify that Hillary was with him stealing sod from the golf course when the murder was committed.In the mix is a sordid woman (Nicole Kidman) who wants to have celebrity sex with Hillary.  The only way Hillary will talk to the newspaper men is if they bring Charlotte (Kidman) to prison with them.  Prison rules forbid any touching.  In their first meeting, Charlotte as instructed by Hillary, spreads her legs and opens her mouth while Hillary...well, you get the picture.  All while Ward and Yardley look on.  Jack, who acts as a driver for the crew has a big time crush on Charlotte... and yes they do.Directed by Lee Daniels (""Precious""), this isn't a pretty picture.  It is full of unlikable people who do unlikeable things, but damn if I wasn't a bit locked in.

The acting performances alone - particularly by Matthew McConaughey (who seems to finally have shaken off the talentless-hunk-who-every-loves-to-hates label), Nicole Kidman (who is superb as the promiscuous floozy), and John Cusack, who is surprisingly good as convict sleazebag - make the Paperboy watchable. Kudos too to Macy Grey, whose stage charisma translates well onto the silver screen. On a visceral level, director Lee Daniels serves up a steamy gumbo that lives up to its R rating. Sex? It's there. Violence? Present and correct. Sex and violence? You betcha. The Paperboy presses all these buttons with a gratuitousness befitting the 'pulp noir' genre. No problem there. But it's in the storytelling department that the Paperboy fails to deliver. The love story between Jack and Charlotte, for example, never really ignites. I suspect this is partly because of Zac Efron's shortcomings as a screen actor. He has the dreamy, photogenic good looks but not the acting chops to pull it off and certainly not the screen presence to create chemistry with Nicole Kidman. The main plotline (investigative journalism pursued in the face of institutionalised racism, etc.) sort of stutters along in fits and bursts but rarely grabs hold. I often found myself struggling to put together the nuts and bolts of the storyline. This is nothing new per se; I would struggle to put together the nuts and bolts of a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but in the case of Paperboy, the continuity and plot coherence really is all over the place.In very broad strokes, the Paperboy comes across like a kind of Wild Things with an extra helping of sleaze, but Wild Things is pound-for-pound a far better movie, despite the presence of Denise Richards, possibly the worst actress in celluloid history.",3,Watchable but flawed in execution,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,1882,"['Steamy', 'goings', 'deep', 'south', 'journalist', 'save', 'convict', 'death', 'row.First', 'good', 'news', 'acting', 'performances', 'alone', 'particularly', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'finally', 'have', 'shaken', 'off', 'talentless-hunk-who-every-loves-to-hates', 'label', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'superb', 'promiscuous', 'floozy', 'John', 'Cusack', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'convict', 'sleazebag', 'make', 'Paperboy', 'watchable', 'Kudos', 'too', 'Macy', 'Grey', 'stage', 'charisma', 'well', 'silver', 'screen', 'visceral', 'level', 'director', 'Lee', 'Daniels', 'up', 'steamy', 'gumbo', 'up', 'R', 'rating', 'Sex', 'there', 'Violence', 'Present', 'correct', 'Sex', 'violence', 'betcha', 'Paperboy', 'buttons', 'gratuitousness', 'befitting', ""'pulp"", 'noir', 'genre', 'problem', 'there', 'storytelling', 'department', 'Paperboy', 'deliver', 'love', 'story', 'Jack', 'Charlotte', 'example', 'never', 'really', 'suspect', 'partly', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'shortcomings', 'screen', 'actor', 'dreamy', 'photogenic', 'good', 'looks', 'not', 'acting', 'chops', 'pull', 'off', 'certainly', 'not', 'screen', 'presence', 'create', 'chemistry', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'main', 'plotline', 'investigative', 'journalism', 'pursued', 'face', 'institutionalised', 'racism', 'etc', 'sort', 'stutters', 'fits', 'bursts', 'rarely', 'grabs', 'hold', 'often', 'found', 'struggling', 'put', 'together', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'storyline', 'nothing', 'new', 'se', 'would', 'struggle', 'put', 'together', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'cartoon', 'case', 'Paperboy', 'continuity', 'plot', 'coherence', 'really', 'place.In', 'very', 'broad', 'strokes', 'Paperboy', 'kind', 'Wild', 'Things', 'extra', 'helping', 'sleaze', 'Wild', 'Things', 'pound-for-pound', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'presence', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'possibly', 'worst', 'actress', 'celluloid', 'history']",The Paperboy

Not particulary fond of the actors in it, but was surprised how good they were. You need to read up on this movie before seeing it with blind eyes.

This is not a film I would show to everyone. It will have its small audience that will appreciate it as an ""art film"" that won't be a big seller or rental. Glad to see such big names take a risk with such a film (especially Kidman). This is Kidman's best work since her brilliant performance in To Die For. Just wished more films like this one would come around more often and not the same junk as the last movie you have seen. Risks don't happen enough when it comes to film making.

The movie trailer made it sound like this was going to be a Florida sun-baked crime thriller not unlike, say, ""Body Heat"" from the early 80s. And the of course there was going to be the already heavily buzzed about performance of Nicole Kidman! The movie opened recently, and I saw it at the Landmark E Street Cinema in Washington in a solidly packed (but not sold out) theatre.""The Paperboy"" (2012 release; 101 min.) brngs the parallel story, set in Florida 1969, of how Charlotte, played by Nicole Kidman, strikes up a penpal friendship with an inmate, convicted murderer Hillary Van Wetter (played by John Cuseck), and how two reporters from the Miami Times, Ward (played by Matthew McConaughey) and Yardley (played by David Oyelowo), come up from Miami to do their own investigation whether Hillary is really guilty of murder or whether he was framed. The other major role in the movie is for Ward's little brother Jack (played by Zac Efron), who is the gofer for the reporters. Given the type of movie this is, to give away more of the plot would ruind your viewing experience, so you'll just have to see how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, yes this is a crime thriller of sorts, but the movie was never able to captivate me completely (and in that sense, this ain't no ""Body Heat""). Plus there were several sidebars that really had nothing to do with advancing the plot and were unnecessary in my view (the ""gay S&M;"" scene comes to mind, among others). So you can say that the movie ultimately was a disappointment for me. But it wasn't a complete waste of my time either, on account of Nicole Kidman's amazing, barn-burning performance as the wild and crazy Charlotte. Kidman brings the performance without holding back. She is sly, funny, shocking, vulnerable. But wait, there is more! If you think you've seen it all, you will be floored as well by the performance from John Cusack, whose Hillary character is so deranged and sick, it is hard to believe this is the same actor who brought us the oh-so-likeable Lloyd character in ""Say Anything"". Also a quick note that Matthew McConaughey brings another interesting off-center performance as Ward, but to see him at the top of his game, I'd urge you to check him out in the recent ""Killer Joe"" movie. The movie audience I saw this with in the theatre seemed similarly perplexed and non-plussed as I was.

This may not be the reason people see films, but it's hard to deny that people like this exist. As in ""Precious"", few of the characters are likeable, or even smart, but I was taken in by the narrative being presented by a dedicated cast. Indeed, Nicole Kidman was over the top in portraying a delusional woman, wanting more than life has given her, with hopes and dreams of something better. It's the performance of an A-List actress daring to push the envelope and create unpleasantness in an effort to create a complete character. She is to be commended. The entire cast was going against their perceived personae, and they succeed.What kept going thru my mind was that there ARE people like this, and it was a courageous effort for all involved to portray a side of life that many people simply choose to think doesn't exist. I don't go out of my way to see crazy people doing sensationalistic things; rather, was prompted to see it because of Kidman's lauded performance (SAG, etc.) Certainly, Kidman was fine, though she slipped into her native accent a few times. This was supposed to be a revolutionary performance from Zac Efron, but he really just played a delusional teen in love. McConnaughey played a gay character, and Cusack played mean and conniving. Indeed, everyone played against type (except, maybe Efron). Macy Gray always looks like she's stoned, but her sweet scenes with Efron were resonating. It took place in the late 60's, so maybe Macy was trying to copy the girls in ""The Help"". She just didn't have enough spunk.I have no problem with the sleaziness, meanness, sexual innuendo, or basic stupidity of the characters.

Individually, as an ensemble, and as characters in this story each actor (here I include Zac Efron who has proven his worth with this performance) provides moments that are single, intertwined, and part of a whole pastry in this bubbling tale of Southern civility and savagery.  I couldn't take my eyes away for a second for fear I'd miss another nuance casually thrown out by an eyebrow raised or a smile playing across the lips or an eye dimming with despair or brightening with hope.  Lee Daniels (who gave us 'Precious') must have borrowed his grandmother's recipe for stirring up a stewpot full of hot trashy desires and alligator innards into an exercise in pot boiling that truly proves that given the right leavening the South can rise again and again.  The actors took a big chance making this movie and they wallow in their found freedom of expression within this recipe like hogs at the trough.  Nicole Kidman will astonish you and numb you to the accomplishments of Matthew, John and David but the real shocker is how well Efron plays off of Kidman.

Yeardley was not a black man in the book.  There wasn't a lot of racist matter in the book; actually very little.  Yet, the movie had a lot of racist stuff in it.

Smith,"[0, 0]","Matthew McConaughey, John Cusack, almost unrecognizable, and Nicole Kidman,  in a role so opposite Virginia Wolfe in The Hours; these are truly amazing actors.  The superb range of these 3 made up for a rather meaningless plot, that of getting re-tried/exonerated a perhaps not guilty swine of a man charged w/ murder, but incompetently defended.  The bizarre twists into human character, and the setting, in part the swamps of"" Deliverance"" type S. Florida made the movie, for me at least, unforgettable; jolting. The exploration of details of the case made for a good mystery; I watched it twice, then a third time.  I can't say this flic is for everyone; but if you're a fan of any of the 3 above mentioned actors, and interested in watching a pretty graphically shocking movie, and a decent mystery, this one would be right up your alley.I've read the book, and of course it delves much more deeply into the characters' history; a picture may be worth a thousand words, but the right words are hard to put on film, sometime impossible; but the movie did a good job of the slight alterations it did make.

The story is in part narrated by Anita Chester(Macy Gray), the maid who breaks ""The Help"" stereotype. A mean sheriff of a small southern town was killed. Swamp man Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack) was convicted of the crime on sketchy evidence and poor representation. Ward Jansen (Matthew McConaughey) is a former resident of the town and now works for the Miami Herald. He has returned to town, along with an African-American side kick Yardley Acheman (David Oyelowo) to conduct an investigative story. His dad W.W, Jansen (Scott Glenn) owns the town's newspaper and is concerned that such an article might damage his paper.Ward's young buck brother Jack (Zac Efron) comes along to help. The three of them are aided by Charlotte ""We all got our dark side"" Bless (Nicole Kidman) who is a rather nasty woman who is in love with Hillary Van Wetter through their correspondence, although up to now they have never met. Hillary is not very likeable, and would rather look up Charlotte's dress than contribute to his own defense to get off of death row. Jack is sweet on Charlotte who unmercifully teases him.The film is quirky and the raw sexuality of Kidman draws you into the film. The film builds up for a big twist, but then ends rather abruptly, almost as if it was a true story. I found 3/4 of the film to be interesting. I think Nicolas Cage would have been better than Cusack for a swamp man. As a classy Aussie, you can't help but be in awe at Kidman's southern trash performance.

It is not clear to whom she is telling the story or why except she does ask how much money she will be paid.The movie centers around relationships -- Macy Gray and Zac Efron; Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman; Zac Efron and Matthew McConaughey; and Nicole Kidman and John Cusack.Nicole Kidman and John Cusack give amazing performances.In the beginning I did not recognize Nicole Kidman -- she had me convinced she was a poor white woman from Florida who wrote letters to convicts and was convinced that Hillary van Wetter (played by John Cusack) should not be on death row for allegedly killing Sheriff Call.I also did not recognize John Cusack at first -- he had me convinced he was a crude, violent, poor white man from Florida who lived in the swamp and hunted and gutted alligators.Zac Efron's performance was also worthy and the anchor of the movie.Macy Gray's performance is worthy of a professional seasoned actress.Who exactly killed Sheriff Call is never settled.",4,Amazing performances,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,1538,"['basic', 'plot', 'Ward', 'Jansen', 'played', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Miami', 'back', 'hometown', 'prove', 'who', 'really', 'killed', 'Sheriff', 'Thurmond', 'Call', 'not', 'believe', 'Hillary', 'van', 'Wetter', 'social', 'outcast', 'who', 'was', 'convicted', 'murder', 'soon', 'be', 'executed', 'killed', 'Sheriff', 'Call', 'Van', 'Wetter', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Charlotte', 'Bless', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'had', 'role', 'convincing', 'Ward', 'van', 'Wetter', 'innocent.The', 'Jansen', 'family', 'maid', 'Anita', 'Chester', 'played', 'Macy', 'Gray', 'movie', 'time', 'future', 'not', 'clear', 'whom', 'telling', 'story', 'why', 'ask', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'will', 'be', 'paid.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'relationships', 'Macy', 'Gray', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'John', 'Cusack.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'John', 'Cusack', 'give', 'amazing', 'performances.In', 'beginning', 'did', 'not', 'recognize', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'had', 'convinced', 'was', 'poor', 'white', 'woman', 'Florida', 'who', 'wrote', 'letters', 'convicts', 'was', 'convinced', 'Hillary', 'van', 'Wetter', 'played', 'John', 'Cusack', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'death', 'row', 'allegedly', 'killing', 'Sheriff', 'Call.I', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'recognize', 'John', 'Cusack', 'first', 'had', 'convinced', 'was', 'crude', 'violent', 'poor', 'white', 'man', 'Florida', 'who', 'lived', 'swamp', 'hunted', 'gutted', 'alligators.Zac', 'Efron', 'performance', 'was', 'also', 'worthy', 'anchor', 'movie.Macy', 'Gray', 'performance', 'worthy', 'professional', 'seasoned', 'actress.Who', 'exactly', 'killed', 'Sheriff', 'Call', 'never', 'settled']",The Paperboy

1591637,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B009AMAKBI,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","With Hollywood A-list actors including Nicole Kidman and Matthew McConaughey, ""The Paperboy"" wants to shock us so much. Perhaps you have already heard about Kidman's character urinating on someone else. But what is really shocking is that for all the highly stylized acting and direction from Lee Daniels, ""The Paperboy"" is not really fascinating. This overcooked potboiler is curiously boring, feeling emotionally remote.Set in 1969, Florida, the film follows the story of ""the paperboy"" Jack Jansen (Zac Efron) recently kicked out of college. While Jack helps his brother and the Miami Times reporter Ward (McConaughey) researching and writing about a death-row inmate Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack) convicted for the murder of a local sheriff, Jack is attracted to a Southern woman Charlotte Bless (Kidman), who has been corresponding with Van Wetter.Now, my synopsis may make ""The Paperboy"" sound like a standard Southern noir, which the film is simply not. In fact, it is hard to describe what the film is all about, and this is not a compliment. It is a hot and steamy melodrama where no one really cares what is going on around them, so why should we? It is not that the film is all about shock value; it is rather that we are underwhelmed by the film's obvious attempt to impress us with over-the-top acting and the showy camerawork.Obviously the film has so many things to say, but with these larger than life characters vying for attention, I am not really sure we should take this ""thriller"" or whatever it is seriously.",2,A Mess,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,1533,"['Hollywood', 'A-list', 'actors', 'including', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Paperboy', 'shock', 'so', 'much', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'already', 'heard', 'Kidman', 'character', 'urinating', 'someone', 'else', 'what', 'really', 'shocking', 'highly', 'stylized', 'acting', 'direction', 'Lee', 'Daniels', 'Paperboy', 'not', 'really', 'fascinating', 'overcooked', 'potboiler', 'curiously', 'boring', 'feeling', 'emotionally', 'remote.Set', '1969', 'Florida', 'film', 'story', 'paperboy', 'Jack', 'Jansen', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'recently', 'kicked', 'college', 'Jack', 'brother', 'Miami', 'Times', 'reporter', 'Ward', 'McConaughey', 'researching', 'writing', 'death-row', 'inmate', 'Hillary', 'Van', 'Wetter', 'John', 'Cusack', 'convicted', 'murder', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Jack', 'attracted', 'Southern', 'woman', 'Charlotte', 'Bless', 'Kidman', 'who', 'been', 'corresponding', 'Van', 'Wetter.Now', 'synopsis', 'may', 'make', 'Paperboy', 'sound', 'standard', 'Southern', 'noir', 'film', 'simply', 'not', 'fact', 'hard', 'describe', 'what', 'film', 'not', 'compliment', 'hot', 'steamy', 'melodrama', 'where', 'one', 'really', 'what', 'going', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'not', 'film', 'shock', 'value', 'rather', 'are', 'underwhelmed', 'film', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'impress', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'showy', 'camerawork.Obviously', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'say', 'larger', 'life', 'characters', 'vying', 'attention', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'should', 'take', 'thriller', 'whatever', 'seriously']",The Paperboy
