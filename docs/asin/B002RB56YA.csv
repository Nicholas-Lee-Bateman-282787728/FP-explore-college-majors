It is about three senior citizens policemen in the UK who are recruited to return to the force to solve cold cases.  They work under a younger woman who was demoted to this job after a dog got killed in a police raid she led.  She became a pariah to the public and had to be buried in this department.I have really come to love the characters and none more than our nerdy one, played by Alan Armstrong, who is a font of information. He is also a super computer nerd and his long suffering wife Hester has become as great a character as he is.  Next up is Jerry, played by Dennis Waterman.  He is also hilarious as a senior copper who still draws the ladies.  He also has a retinue of ex wives who all dine with him regularly en masse. Quite good are the other two, Jack and the woman head.The mysteries are secondary to all of this.  They do solve them and they are interesting.  However, it is their peculiar interaction with suspects, witnesses, one another and police superiors which makes this compulsively watchable.

The result is Britain's most popular drama series.In Season 2, the UCOS (Unsolved Crime and Open Case) squad is really beginning to hit its stride. The stories are imaginative, the mysteries satisfying, but the main charm of the series is in the characters. There's detail-obsessed Brian, cheery cockney Gerry, wise old Jack and their boss, smart, tough Sandra, all adding their strengths to the solving of each crime. Along with the drama, there's lots of humor and a good deal of nose-thumbing at authority.Recruiting veteran actors for this project was a major brain-wave. James Bolam (Jack), Alun Armstrong (Brian) and Dennis Waterman (Gerry) have all appeared many times on British TV, but never to better advantage than they appear here. They play off each other brilliantly and seem to be having a great time in each other's company. In this series, Amanda Redman (Sandra) loosens up a bit and joins the old reprobates in their crafty undermining of the system and subtle mockery of their strait-laced head of department, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Strickland. The camaraderie of the group, the funny lines and the unorthodox approach they bring to crime-solving all add up to a wonderfully original series.Thoroughly recommended.",5,Britain's most popular drama series,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",2012,1350,"['came', 'up', 'idea', 'New', 'Tricks', 'was', 'genius', 'came', 'up', 'casting', 'was', 'genius', 'x', '2', 'result', 'Britain', 'most', 'popular', 'drama', 'series.In', 'Season', '2', 'UCOS', 'Unsolved', 'Crime', 'Open', 'Case', 'squad', 'really', 'beginning', 'hit', 'stride', 'stories', 'are', 'imaginative', 'mysteries', 'satisfying', 'main', 'charm', 'series', 'characters', 'detail-obsessed', 'Brian', 'cheery', 'cockney', 'Gerry', 'wise', 'old', 'Jack', 'boss', 'smart', 'tough', 'Sandra', 'adding', 'strengths', 'solving', 'crime', 'drama', 'lots', 'humor', 'good', 'deal', 'nose-thumbing', 'authority.Recruiting', 'veteran', 'actors', 'project', 'was', 'major', 'brain-wave', 'James', 'Bolam', 'Jack', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'Brian', 'Dennis', 'Waterman', 'Gerry', 'have', 'appeared', 'many', 'times', 'British', 'TV', 'never', 'better', 'advantage', 'appear', 'here', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'brilliantly', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'other', 'company', 'series', 'Amanda', 'Redman', 'Sandra', 'up', 'bit', 'old', 'reprobates', 'crafty', 'undermining', 'system', 'subtle', 'mockery', 'strait-laced', 'head', 'department', 'Deputy', 'Assistant', 'Commissioner', 'Strickland', 'camaraderie', 'group', 'funny', 'lines', 'unorthodox', 'approach', 'bring', 'crime-solving', 'add', 'up', 'wonderfully', 'original', 'series.Thoroughly', 'recommended']",N/A

I can't stop chuckling at seeing all four of them (supervisor included) on their hands and knees, searching for the curse jar to retrieve their booty, with a door opening behind Jerry and shoving him fully onto the floor with a muttered expletive. Hysterical - you never feel you're watching actors.

1285197,A2UYGOYMV73826,B002RB56YA,Rushmore,"[1, 1]","This series was recommended by a fellow Amazon reviewer when I mentioned that I loved Inspector Morse.  We are just about finished watching Season 2 now and are looking forward to continuing with this very fun series.I think this concept particularly appeals to our demographic.  Let's just say the younger generation might not be particularly enthralled with a bunch of late-middle-aged guys and a slightly younger and much hotter female boss, working cold cases and getting into just enough trouble to entertain themselves and the viewer but not quite enough to get the unit shut down - it's a very fine line and they dance it nimbly.We particularly enjoy the growing chemistry among the detectives.  In the first season they emerged as a group of not particularly ingratiating sad sacks with somewhat tarnished pasts.  They were good cops with different skill sets, and they all wanted to continue to make a contribution.  In Season Two we get more of them interacting, starting to enjoy each other's company, and actually taking care of each other.  So, although we are laughing a lot, there are some genuinely touching moments.Then there is the ambitious young Deputy Assistant Commissioner who clearly has aspirations of greater glory.  Mostly our heroes are getting into scrapes and using unorthodox measures that end up making him look bad, so he is constantly threatening to shut them down.  We know, of course, that won't happen, because there is Seasons 3, 4, 5, etc., but it's fun watching him sputter and get red in the face.Amanda Redman does a great job of riding herd over the detectives.  She has an incident from her own past (very funny) that put the brakes on her career.  Running UCOS is pretty much her last chance.  Through most of Season One she had an air of quiet desperation, but by Season Two she cares pretty passionately about her guys and their quest and goes to great lengths to defend their out-of-the-box approach.  She tries to have a personal life, not very successfully.Basically this is a fun, intelligent detective series with an unusual and interesting group of characters at its center.  It keeps getting better.  It's entertaining and relatively uncomplicated - just the thing for a Friday night video date with my spouse.

I was hooked in the first 10 minutes and had the thrill of finding a show that is smart, intelligent, and creative. I've now finished both series 1 and 2 and am anxiously awaiting Series 3 - to be released on 2/22/11 in the US. I think of this band of retired British police officers (led by the smart and sexy - and sometimes paranoid - female detective) as my friends. The actors are superb. And the twists and turns in the story keep it fresh.If you are reading this review, you have probably already seen Series 1. Series 2 is just as great. A bit shorter as there is no pilot episode.The TOP BOS has changed too. Not Sandra - but the Police Chief (or whatever his title is). I'm not as thrilled with the new guy. No personality. But he's rarely in a scene. A lot less about Sandra's personal life this time (and her hair color (black roots) seems to strangely vary from light to dark even within an episode. But this is not a complaint. The guys get funnier all the time.Oh yes, read the credits. Three well known British actresses from the 1970s show up in three different episodes. You'd never recognize them if you hadn't read their names. Rita Tushingham is the social worker in Episode 5 and Jane Asher (Paul McCartney's girlfriend for five years) is a wealthy animal breeder in Episode 8. The real surprise for me was the one time incredibly sexy James Bond girl Honor Blackman as a celebrity TV chef in Episode 4.If you haven't found this series before - start with Series 1.
