Neil Peart was already my hero back then, with the intelligent and progressive playing and perfect writing that I heard from the Rush recordings, but I can not explain how shocking it was for me to see him play live with such energy, power and passion which not only shook the drum-kit, the ground and the concert hall but my mind as well. Those images changed my drumming style and my whole concept of musical understanding. I've been a Peart fanatic ever since and I always will be...This DVD was supposed to be everything I've been waiting for...Being a professional drummer and a hard-core Peart fan for about 15 years, knowing every fill in every song (like many of you out there reading this review) I could not wait to watch ""A work in progress"".Unlike many reviewers here I was totally disappointed. What I found was a person who in his own search of a new self, lost many qualities which made him what he is. In this DVD what you are going to see is a different Peart, who aside from changing his grip changed his powerful and passionate style. The intelligent playing and perfect song-writing are still there but the power and passion and energy are unfortunately not. Altough the process that he went through and the wish for self-improvement should be appreciated, I can't help but ask ""if it ain't broke why fix it?"".After all Neil Peart is certainly not a drumming hero for playing in orbital motions, or a circular set-up or because of Freddy Grueber. He surely is not as technical as Dave Weckl or Dennis Chambers and he will never be at least not in the Jazz and Fusion Department. However when it comes to power, passion, and creating the pulse of rock, the aforementioned names could not even come close to Neil. Neil is a unique drummer creating incredible drum-parts, incorporating different percussions into rock drumming, signature rhtyms and fills, and most important of all he does all this with incredible power and passion which comes straight from the heart.I guess that he also wasn't after all too pleased with the new direction that he took, as when he came back after his long break, he came back much more like the old Neal while keeping the newly gained qualities at a reasonable level.I would have liked to see the ""Real"" Professor playing classics like The Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer, Subdivisions, The Enemy within, etc.. instead of this stuff. At least this was what I hoped or NEEDED to see.",2,disappointed,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,2554,"['remember', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'Grace', 'Pressure', 'Tour', 'Video', 'also', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Rush', 'live', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'was', 'already', 'hero', 'back', 'then', 'intelligent', 'progressive', 'playing', 'perfect', 'writing', 'heard', 'Rush', 'recordings', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'how', 'shocking', 'was', 'see', 'play', 'live', 'such', 'energy', 'power', 'passion', 'not', 'only', 'shook', 'drum-kit', 'ground', 'concert', 'hall', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'images', 'changed', 'drumming', 'style', 'whole', 'concept', 'musical', 'understanding', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Peart', 'fanatic', 'ever', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'DVD', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'Being', 'professional', 'drummer', 'hard-core', 'Peart', 'fan', '15', 'years', 'knowing', 'fill', 'song', 'many', 'there', 'reading', 'review', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'watch', 'work', 'progress', '.Unlike', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'was', 'totally', 'disappointed', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'person', 'who', 'own', 'search', 'new', 'self', 'lost', 'many', 'qualities', 'made', 'what', 'DVD', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'different', 'Peart', 'who', 'aside', 'changing', 'grip', 'changed', 'powerful', 'passionate', 'style', 'intelligent', 'playing', 'perfect', 'song-writing', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'power', 'passion', 'energy', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'process', 'went', 'wish', 'self-improvement', 'should', 'be', 'appreciated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'ask', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'why', 'fix', '.After', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'certainly', 'not', 'drumming', 'hero', 'playing', 'orbital', 'motions', 'circular', 'set-up', 'Freddy', 'Grueber', 'surely', 'not', 'as', 'technical', 'Dave', 'Weckl', 'Dennis', 'Chambers', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'least', 'not', 'Jazz', 'Fusion', 'Department', 'However', 'when', 'power', 'passion', 'creating', 'pulse', 'rock', 'aforementioned', 'names', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Neil', 'Neil', 'unique', 'drummer', 'creating', 'incredible', 'drum-parts', 'incorporating', 'different', 'percussions', 'rock', 'drumming', 'signature', 'rhtyms', 'fills', 'most', 'important', 'incredible', 'power', 'passion', 'straight', 'heart.I', 'guess', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'pleased', 'new', 'direction', 'took', 'when', 'came', 'back', 'long', 'break', 'came', 'back', 'much', 'more', 'old', 'Neal', 'keeping', 'newly', 'gained', 'qualities', 'reasonable', 'level.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Real', 'Professor', 'playing', 'classics', 'Spirit', 'Radio', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Subdivisions', 'Enemy', 'etc..', 'instead', 'stuff', 'least', 'was', 'what', 'hoped', 'NEEDED', 'see']",N/A

It is well over 2 and 1/2 hours of pure amazement and wonder.  Neil as I expected is an excellent teacher and does a wonderful job explaining each song in beautiful detail and example.  Every song from Test For Echo is played by Neil and afterwards he explains the major parts of the song and explains the what and whys of why he did what he was trying to accomplish through his drum parts.  Neil plays the drums to backing tracks sans drums and he is just such a master at the art of drumming.  The majority of the video takes place inside a studio, but he is shown out in nature, rowing a boat, walking through snow in snowshoes and is even shown on a back porch demonstrating how he warms up on a practice pad.  Nature is used to explain his new techinique by speaking in terms of roundness.  His drum study with drum guru Fred Gruber is gone over in great detail and Neil talks of how a new approach of drumming was taken on.

491597,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,B0000042JV,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[4, 4]","This is an excellent DVD if you take it for what it is, and it is important to understand what it is before you plonk down your hard-earned cash for it.In a nutshell, this is a drum instructional video as a portrait in time of Neil Peart as a drummer.  It probably won't do much for you if you do not know anything about playing drums.  It probably won't do much for you _as an instructional video_ even if you've only been taking drum lessons for a short period of time.  The assumption here is that you're at least an intermediate student.  That you can easily tackle at least basic grooves and fills and pick up the same by ear.  That you are familiar with the basic ideas of drum playing, including rudiments, and that you are familiar with some of the common problems of drum playing and coming up with drum parts to fit songs.There are two other very important things to keep in mind: (1) The emphasis for the ""instructional"" aspect is that Neil is going to demonstrate things to you by showing them to you--by watching him play.  He does verbally explain some of what he's doing, but again, the assumption is that you can pick most of it up merely by watching him and listening.  He spends more time explaining _why_ he's playing certain ways, from a compositional perspective, as anything else, and he also spends a lot of time talking about his evolution as a drummer and new techniques he's working on, but from a very general and abstract level--again, a lot of that stuff would only make sense and have significance to someone who is at least at an intermediate level as a drummer.  (2) This video was made near the end of the sessions for _Test for Echo_, so those are the songs that are used for demonstration.The second point in particular really turns a lot of people off of this video.  But this is NOT a video to pick up if you merely want to learn how to play some famous Peart fills or something.  The idea isn't to entertain you with a greatest hits package or some rare concert footage.  The album used for demonstration here is really irrelevant.  The point is to bring you into Peart's mind a bit--to understand why he plays the kinds of things he plays, and to give you food for thought as a player yourself (although these questions are not explicitly asked, they're implied)--how are you approaching playing your drums physically and mentally?  Why are _you_ choosing to play the things you're choosing to play?  Are you thinking about these things?  Although any Rush album or collection of songs would have worked equally well for this purpose, using _Test for Echo_ as the example tunes for this is the best idea, given the date this was recorded--they had just finished making the record, and all of these things were fresh in Peart's head for these tunes.So this is really like an extended private lesson with Peart, where you're an advanced student of his, one who already knows how to play fairly well, but it's time to think about some of the more abstract aspects of composing and playing drum parts.It's not that other kinds of folks can't watch this and get anything out of it, but it's important to understand what to expect and why the material on this DVD is focused on the things it's focused on.  You might be looking for different material, different information.  If so, there are better DVDs for you.  This one isn't bad just because it doesn't teach you how to play the ""Tom Sawyer"" fills, or show you a collection of live drum solos, or show you Rush goofing around in the studio a la the Beatles in Help! or something.",5,Excellent DVD if you take it for what it is,1280707200,"08 2, 2010",2010,3567,"['excellent', 'DVD', 'take', 'what', 'important', 'understand', 'what', 'plonk', 'down', 'hard-earned', 'cash', 'it.In', 'nutshell', 'drum', 'instructional', 'video', 'portrait', 'time', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'drummer', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'anything', 'playing', 'drums', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', '_as', 'instructional', 'video_', 'even', ""'ve"", 'only', 'been', 'taking', 'drum', 'lessons', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'assumption', 'here', ""'re"", 'least', 'intermediate', 'student', 'can', 'easily', 'tackle', 'least', 'basic', 'grooves', 'fills', 'pick', 'up', 'same', 'ear', 'are', 'familiar', 'basic', 'ideas', 'drum', 'playing', 'including', 'rudiments', 'are', 'familiar', 'common', 'problems', 'drum', 'playing', 'coming', 'up', 'drum', 'parts', 'fit', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'very', 'important', 'things', 'keep', 'mind', '1', 'emphasis', 'instructional', 'aspect', 'Neil', 'going', 'demonstrate', 'things', 'showing', 'watching', 'play', 'verbally', 'explain', 'what', 'doing', 'again', 'assumption', 'can', 'pick', 'most', 'up', 'merely', 'watching', 'listening', 'more', 'time', 'explaining', 'playing', 'certain', 'ways', 'compositional', 'perspective', 'anything', 'else', 'also', 'lot', 'time', 'talking', 'evolution', 'drummer', 'new', 'techniques', 'working', 'very', 'general', 'abstract', 'level', 'again', 'lot', 'stuff', 'would', 'only', 'make', 'sense', 'have', 'significance', 'someone', 'who', 'least', 'intermediate', 'level', 'drummer', '2', 'video', 'was', 'made', 'end', 'sessions', '_Test', 'Echo_', 'are', 'songs', 'are', 'used', 'demonstration.The', 'second', 'point', 'particular', 'really', 'lot', 'people', 'video', 'NOT', 'video', 'pick', 'up', 'merely', 'want', 'learn', 'how', 'play', 'famous', 'Peart', 'fills', 'something', 'idea', ""n't"", 'entertain', 'greatest', 'hits', 'package', 'rare', 'concert', 'footage', 'album', 'used', 'demonstration', 'here', 'really', 'irrelevant', 'point', 'bring', 'Peart', 'mind', 'bit', 'understand', 'why', 'kinds', 'things', 'give', 'food', 'thought', 'player', 'questions', 'are', 'not', 'explicitly', 'asked', ""'re"", 'implied', 'how', 'are', 'approaching', 'playing', 'drums', 'physically', 'mentally', 'Why', 'are', '_you_', 'choosing', 'play', 'things', ""'re"", 'choosing', 'play', 'Are', 'thinking', 'things', 'Rush', 'album', 'collection', 'songs', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'equally', 'well', 'purpose', 'using', '_Test', 'Echo_', 'example', 'tunes', 'best', 'idea', 'given', 'date', 'was', 'recorded', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'making', 'record', 'things', 'were', 'fresh', 'Peart', 'head', 'tunes.So', 'really', 'extended', 'private', 'lesson', 'Peart', 'where', ""'re"", 'advanced', 'student', 'one', 'who', 'already', 'how', 'play', 'fairly', 'well', 'time', 'think', 'more', 'abstract', 'aspects', 'composing', 'playing', 'drum', 'parts.It', 'not', 'other', 'kinds', 'folks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'get', 'anything', 'important', 'understand', 'what', 'expect', 'why', 'material', 'DVD', 'focused', 'things', 'focused', 'might', 'be', 'looking', 'different', 'material', 'different', 'information', 'so', 'are', 'better', 'DVDs', 'one', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', ""n't"", 'teach', 'how', 'play', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'fills', 'show', 'collection', 'live', 'drum', 'solos', 'show', 'Rush', 'goofing', 'around', 'studio', 'la', 'Beatles', 'Help', 'something']",N/A

I can play all of the Rush drum pieces, and must say that the drumwork included on this video is not vintage Neil. The Test For Echo album is documented throughout, and Neil plays along with all of that album's songs, and nothing else. Although insight on Neil's creation of drum parts is interesting, I feel this video could have been edited to fit on one tape. It is rather slow paced, and is geared more towards a drum novice. Neil switched to traditional grip for most of this album, and I don't understand why. His playing is less impressive on this album than any before it. On the Test For Echo tour, Neil used match grip for all of the previous Rush songs, and it was much more powerful, and active. I am not arguing against traditional grip, but just feel that Neil is much more proficient at using match grip. If it isn't broke, why fix it? Instead of A Work In Progress, I'd rather see Neil at the top of his game, using match grip, on a collection of more active drum pieces than this album includes, and a few drum solo pieces which Neil is especially gifted.",3,Not what I expected from a top drummer,1014422400,"02 23, 2002",2002,1153,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Rush', 'fan', 'drummer', '20', 'years', 'have', 'CD', 'can', 'play', 'Rush', 'drum', 'pieces', 'must', 'say', 'drumwork', 'included', 'video', 'not', 'vintage', 'Neil', 'Test', 'Echo', 'album', 'documented', 'Neil', 'album', 'songs', 'nothing', 'else', 'insight', 'Neil', 'creation', 'drum', 'parts', 'interesting', 'feel', 'video', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'fit', 'one', 'tape', 'rather', 'slow', 'paced', 'geared', 'more', 'towards', 'drum', 'novice', 'Neil', 'switched', 'traditional', 'grip', 'most', 'album', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'playing', 'less', 'impressive', 'album', 'Test', 'Echo', 'tour', 'Neil', 'used', 'match', 'grip', 'previous', 'Rush', 'songs', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'active', 'am', 'not', 'arguing', 'traditional', 'grip', 'just', 'feel', 'Neil', 'much', 'more', 'proficient', 'using', 'match', 'grip', ""n't"", 'broke', 'why', 'fix', 'Instead', 'A', 'Work', 'Progress', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'Neil', 'top', 'game', 'using', 'match', 'grip', 'collection', 'more', 'active', 'drum', 'pieces', 'album', 'few', 'drum', 'solo', 'pieces', 'Neil', 'especially', 'gifted']",N/A

Neil also disects the songs and goes over the hard fills.The only draw back to this video is that he dose not play the fills slower him self but slows down the film.

It definitely does not disappoint!  Neil gives demonstrations from all of the songs on the album Test For Echo, one of my favorite Rush albums and their peak cd from the 90's.  There is a lot of talking and technical terms, which is not as important to me because I play guitar, but to a drummer this might be a great video to learn from, if you are willing to listen.  A lot of it seems to be very advanced, and if you do not have a disposisition that favors Rush's technical prowess and Neil's perfectionist attitude toward drums, you might not like this.About 2 or 3 songs from Test For Echo are not very good, but the rest are awesome.  You won't like listening to the song itself, but Neil's drumming is so mesmerizing that you can just focus on that and ignore the rest of the song.  All of the drumming demonstrations are extremely good, and at times seem quite unbelievable.  The reviewer who said that Neil was at the 2nd grade level is out of his mind.  Just rent this video, and be taken aback.  I honestly hope that non Rush fans will give this one a try, because it is quite worth it.",5,the drumming on here blows my fricken mind!!,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,1222,"['am', 'not', 'drummer', 'am', 'pretty', 'big', 'Rush', 'fan', 'fan', 'Neil', 'books', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'drumming', 'video', 'definitely', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Neil', 'demonstrations', 'songs', 'album', 'Test', 'Echo', 'one', 'favorite', 'Rush', 'albums', 'peak', 'cd', '90', 'lot', 'talking', 'technical', 'terms', 'not', 'as', 'important', 'play', 'guitar', 'drummer', 'might', 'be', 'great', 'video', 'learn', 'are', 'willing', 'listen', 'lot', 'be', 'very', 'advanced', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'disposisition', 'Rush', 'technical', 'prowess', 'Neil', 'perfectionist', 'attitude', 'drums', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'this.About', '2', '3', 'songs', 'Test', 'Echo', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'rest', 'are', 'awesome', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'listening', 'song', 'Neil', 'drumming', 'so', 'mesmerizing', 'can', 'just', 'focus', 'ignore', 'rest', 'song', 'drumming', 'demonstrations', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'times', 'seem', 'quite', 'unbelievable', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'Neil', 'was', '2nd', 'grade', 'level', 'mind', 'Just', 'rent', 'video', 'be', 'taken', 'aback', 'honestly', 'hope', 'non', 'Rush', 'fans', 'will', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'quite', 'worth']",N/A
