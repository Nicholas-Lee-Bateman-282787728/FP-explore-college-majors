Overall, it's very poorly done -- the writing, cinematography, acting -- everything is simply terrible! This film makes Tyler Perry look like Martin Scorsese or Spike Lee! (Even Tyler Perry fans will be offended by the ultra-poor quality of this thrown-together urban affair -- and that's saying a lot!) Especially poor in performance is the lead male character, Cordell Moore: he's too old for the role, too flat and one-dimensional for it, and to put it kindly, leaves a great deal to be desired in the acting department! He recites one of the most offensively inappropriate lines (about preferring a man do ""this"" to him, as opposed to doing ""this"" to his woman) you will hands down ever hear in a bad movie -- guaranteed! He is boring. The film is boring. And the story has been told many times before, in much more entertaining ways! No one is convincing -- to the point of being laughable.  Usually, we can garner an unintended laugh from poor productions like this -- you know, when they're so bad, they're good. But not in this case: it's simply bad on all levels -- and there's no humor to be found. (Also, of note in the poor acting department: Elise Neal. Wow, what an amateur!)

David Alan Washington (Moore) is a very controlling man, everything must be on time and to his liking.  When he comes home to find his fiance Robin (Atkins) with another man he calls off the wedding.  Then begins to date Tina, and becomes much, much worse.  Some movies you watch have such an emotional impact on you that it effects your judgment of the film.  This is one of them.  The acting from the main cast is good (the supporting is if'y at best) but the Washington character distracts you from the flaws of the movie and you focus all your attention on how much you hate him and want horrible things to happen to him. The steps he takes in order to control the women in his life are very dangerous, and the fact that some people are actually like this is terrifying. It's hard to fully judge how good the movie was because of the hatred you feel toward the main character. It has such a polarizing affect that you can't stop watching because you want to see him get what he deserves. Overall a much better movie then I expected and I think everyone should watch this in order to see the way this ""man"" acts. You will like the movie but hate David.  I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - I would if someone who hasn't seen it wants to watch it.*Also Try - For Colored Girls & I Can Do Bad All By Myself",4,"A must see movie for everyone, not just women.
