If Antonio has DTS on his amplifier he'll be floored by this DVD.Joe Cocker is backed by an incredible band and all I can say is that the performance, in terms of both sound and picture quality, is fantastic!! This DVD is on the level of ""The wall in Berlin"" and Diana Krall's jazz concert in Paris. If you love classic rock this is for you!!As far as Cocker himself I could not help wondering throughout the show if it was age or too much whiskey the night before. Joe is a great singer with a unique voice.",5,Fantastic- that's all,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,593,"['response', 'earlier', 'review', 'Antonio', 'Schemkes', 'ask', 'Ever', 'heard', 'DTS', 'sound', 'Antonio', 'DTS', 'amplifier', ""'ll"", 'be', 'floored', 'DVD.Joe', 'Cocker', 'backed', 'incredible', 'band', 'can', 'say', 'performance', 'terms', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'fantastic', 'DVD', 'level', 'wall', 'Berlin', 'Diana', 'Krall', 'jazz', 'concert', 'Paris', 'love', 'classic', 'rock', 'As', 'far', 'Cocker', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'wondering', 'show', 'was', 'age', 'too', 'much', 'night', 'Joe', 'great', 'singer', 'unique', 'voice']",N/A

He just isn't animated and fun to watch as he was back then. His spastic gyrations used to be a part of his appeal.Now, Joe just stands there and croons away like so many other performers. The good news is that he is surrounded by a solid band and a couple of animated female singers. The instrumental parts in Cocker's songs now give it the vital energy he used to have. His songs are still very listenable, from his ""Mad Dogs and Englishman"" days to the present.Give him credit: he's still introducing new material, unlike a lot of other '60s performers. One of them: ""Into The Mystic"""" is a very nice piece.The capacity crowd is with him all the way and helps generate a little excitement, too.",3,"A Good Concert, Even If Joe Isn't Animated As He Used To Be",1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,889,"['unspectacular', 'solid', '1997', 'concert', 'gravel-voiced', 'old-time', 'rock/blues', 'man', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'still', 'rocking', 'years', 'subdued', 'Woodstock-era', 'days', 'just', ""n't"", 'animated', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'spastic', 'gyrations', 'used', 'be', 'part', 'appeal.Now', 'Joe', 'just', 'croons', 'away', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'performers', 'good', 'news', 'surrounded', 'solid', 'band', 'couple', 'animated', 'female', 'singers', 'instrumental', 'parts', 'Cocker', 'songs', 'now', 'give', 'vital', 'energy', 'used', 'have', 'songs', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'listenable', 'Mad', 'Dogs', 'Englishman', 'days', 'present.Give', 'credit', 'still', 'introducing', 'new', 'material', 'lot', 'other', 'performers', 'One', 'Mystic', 'very', 'nice', 'piece.The', 'capacity', 'crowd', 'way', 'generate', 'little', 'excitement', 'too']",N/A

448162,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6305090394,Kevin Killian,"[2, 2]","Stupendous account of all Cocker's greatest hits, plus some miscellaneous tracks that Cocker management hoped wlould launch a second cemback for the Sheffield-born ""monster voice"" who brought down the house at Woodstock way back when, but in recent years he's been more of a Heritage Rock act, that is, if people remember him at all.  Even John Belushi's imitation of him has lost some of its punch for we aren't accustomed to seeing the two-ton powerhouse flail spastically, his head bobbing up and down towards the skies, then back to the footlights, on our stages on a regular basis.  Be that as it may, Cocker's comeback didn't really take.  ""Across From Midnight"" is a sturdy enough tune but it won't set young hearts afire--middle aged ones either, and I don't think you'll harm yourself by skipping forward this one on the DVD.The amazing this is the power this man generates at age 55.  Mehtinks he'll be going this way at age 80, astonishing when we thought he would never live till he his 30th birthday.  He seemed like one of those mutant freaks like Rondo Hatton born to have an early disabling death.  And here he is still going strong when seemingly healhier specimens have long retired or even gone to their graves to push up the daisies.I always thought putting Joe Cocker in THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA would be a good idea.He has the angelic beast sounds that you need for a good rousing rendition of MUSIC OF THE NIGHT.Here he moans his way through CRY ME A RIVER with much of the power of the old days, and puts Leon Russell in the shade with his majestic, tormented DELTA LADY, which he might try reviving now for Katrina Relief, I think it would go down a storm.  I saw him in 2002 and he had sensibly enough dropped the failed ""Across from Midnight"" from his set list and was once agaion concentrating on the old tried and trues like THE LETTER, UP WHERE WE BELONG, SUMMER IN THE CITY and of course, WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS.

He and the band are dressed in black and the chrome and brass of the stage gives it a metro style while the outline of the stage resembles an jukebox and that kind of gives it a retro style. The songs and his presentation show a maturity that performers that dedicate their lives to music display. Thanks Joe !
