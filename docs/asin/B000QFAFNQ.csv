Over the years we have seen many a comedian try to coerce a laugh from our sometimes ""taking things too seriously"" faces. A number have been successful but none quite as successful as a few such as Gabriel Iglesias. I personally find him so adorably lovable that laughing to his crazy antics comes as naturally as breathing fresh air. As a slightly overweight person myself I adore the fact that he doesn't seem to mind being overweight himself and has classified himself as ""fluffy"" in the big-healthy-husky-fluffy-damn scale. He is refreshingly honest in admitting that he likes to eat and that the quality of life is more important to him than the quantity. I also think he is a genius in the use of sound effects to get someone to laugh. He admits that although he was not the Last Comic Standing in the competition so named, he was the ONLY one to have a special on COMEDY CENTRAL.When he introduces his act on this tape Gabriel admits to having returned to Bakersfield, California where he first got his start. He introduces his mother to the audience and is ""equal opportunity"" as to who he pokes fun at--hispanic and non hispanic alike. He explains the reason he is always wearing Hawaiin shirts is simply that ""they fit"". He quips how Hawaiin people to him looked like ""swollen Mexicans"".
