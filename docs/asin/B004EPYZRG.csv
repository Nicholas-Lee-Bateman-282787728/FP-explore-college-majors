It was kind of cluttered, drab and depressing and somehow it made it difficult to follow the plot of the movie. Some of the characters in the movie seemed pretty good and well-done, but Katherine Heigl seemed unconvincing as an average Jersey girl. Overall, the movie is a decent watch as far as a cop movie type plot goes. It's not much of a romantic movie and frankly, it's not terribly comical either.

Bonito didn't have the icky voice I thought he would have and didn't talk about himself in the 3rd person like he did in the book. Joe was darn near perfect!  I thought Debbie Reynolds did a pretty good job of being Grandma Mazur.  I wasn't all that disappointed with her Mom or her dad, and Joe's Mom was perfect.  Even Vinnie was a perfect slime ball. And you'd recognize Connie anywhere as you would Lula as well.  So year, the casting was pretty good and I love Katherine Heigl in this, she played the perfect Stephanie.All in all the movie was good and I'm looking forward to watching it a second time.

One for the Money, as a book, made me laugh out loud and I have been hooked ever since.I really really really wanted to like this movie. I started watching this movie expecting to like it. I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I like a lot of the actors in this movie, I enjoyed the books bunches and I thought that this had the potential to be a fun, exciting, funny, enjoyable movie.Boy was I dissapointed.And what makes it worse for me, is I believe that even had I not read the books and not been prepared to enjoy this movie; had I just gone into this movie with no expectations I would probably not have enjoyed the movie very much.Everyone who has read the books has played the 'who would be a good Stephanie, who would play Ranger etc' game. My problem was not really that I would have picked different people for the movie. My problem was that the movie moved slow and you never got the tension and gritty feel that I expected. Also, for the largest part of the movie I didn't see the zings and pops that I expected to between the main three characters.Other reviewers are correct- a lot of the details from the book/s are in the movie. The nicknames the men have for Stephanie, Lula, the big blue car etc etc. It was fun to sit and watch this show for that reason. It was neat to have a scavenger hunt of 'that is in the book'.But overall, this movie moved slow. The chemestry between the men and Stephanie was lacking.Maybe the problem was that someone paid too much attention to the details of the book and didn't pay attention to the 'feel' of the book?Eitherway, this is not a big waste of time. It's a cute little movie but compared to the book it simply did not live up to the expectations I had in place.I would love to see a sequel because I can see how the movies would improve as time goes on.I'm afraid though that there simply won't be a sequel because this movie didn't quite make it happen.Enjoy.",3,"3.8 or low four stars.

My first issue is with the casting which is beyond awful! Katherine Heigl is terrible as Stephanie; she overplays in every scene and she is completely lacking in any kind of warmth which is one of Stephanie's trademark characteristics. (Let me clear, I am comparing Stephanie and all the characters to the way they were originally wonderfully written in books 1-12 before JE started letting her daughter and ghostwriter simply slap pages together)Heigl has zero chemistry with the men in her life or with anyone else in the movie. Jason O'Mara is not a bad actor but he was miscast as Morelli. No one so blatantly and quirkily Irish should be portraying a macho Italian cop. Sunjata also fails as Ranger...he isn't good looking enough and he lacks any of Ranger's sensuality, quiet intelligence or strength. He also gets very little screentime in the film which won't make some fans (me included) happy. Grandma Mazur is too young, too well preserved and not eccentric enough. Mr. and Mrs. Plum seem off...she's grating and he's pointless; I just couldn't buy them in their roles.The only characters who worked were Vinnie, Connie and Lula.

I was pleasantly surprised to get a rather faithful adaptation of the characters and the comic feel of Evanovich's writing.  Katherin Heigle surprised me in her role as Stephanie, because she was actually good and not what I expected at all.  She was tough, but always girly and funny.  I figured they would exclude a character or two in the process, but they're all here:  Stephanie's family, Connie, both Morelli and Ranger, Lula, and even Rex the hamster!I wouldn't call the movie fall-down funny, but it was definitely enjoyable and mostly true to the books.  I loved the scene with the old naked guy, and the part where Morelli's car blew up and Stephanie asked him if he wanted it back.  I did have a problem with Grandma Mazur(Debbie Reynolds).  Grandma Mazur was much funnier and crazier in the books, which I would have preferred.  I also expected Lula to be fatter and not just pleasantly plump.  A few other things didn't quite sit well, but all in all, this is a good and mostly faithful adaptation of the books, and I encourage you to at least rent it before you decide to buy it.  The movie is great fun, and Janet Evanovich likes it herself if you look at her facebook profile.  Your he-man movie lover may even enjoy it, so there's another thing it's got going for it.

I myself thought the casting, when I first read about it, was awful. Reviews of the movie by people who had never read any of the books said it was awful and they didn't have anything but the movie itself to go by. SO I waited until I got Netflix and watched it for free.  It was funny and very true to the books. I do think the casting of Grandma Mazur was WAYYYYYYY off, Debbie may be funny but she is way too pretty to be Grandma, who is described in the book as skinny with chicken legs. And while he did an OK acting job, the Ranger in the books is way sexier than the guy on film. he doesn't even say 'Babe"" with the right accentuation. (Listen to an audiobook version if you want to hear Ranger say ""Babe"" the right way.)  But the biggest surprise for me was how well Katherine did as Stephanie. IMO she nailed the part!!!!  I was so sure I wouldn't ""buy"" her in the part, but she did a great job!  And while I am pretty sure there were better looking Italian actors out there to play Morelli, Jason did a great job ACTING the part. They just needed to make him a little more brunette and tan for me to really buy him as Morelli, but he is a hunk! in his own right.  My first choice for Lula would have been Queen Latifah (sp???)  but Sherry was also good in the part.  As for the movie itself, once I got past the casting and just settled in for the story I enjoyed it very much.So while # 1 may have been a disappointment at the box office, if they make book 2 into a movie, I WILL pay to go see it, and that says a lot more than I can say about the most recent books in the series.

With nowhere else to turn to, she takes a job at her cousin Vinnie's Bail Bond as a bail enforcement agent, aka a bounty hunter.Her first assignment is to bring in a former vice cop Joe Morelli, who just happens to be her ex-boyfriend from high school. And she might have tried to hit him with a car. She is determined to bring him in, but in the process stumbles upon the real killer.I recall seeing a few advertisements early in the year for One For the Money, mostly with the funny dinner scenes with Debbie Reynolds. After being panned by critics, getting a 2% rating on rottentomatoes.com, and flopping at the box-office, I had no intention of ever seeing this movie. I happened to stumbled upon the DVD last week for under fifteen dollars and I noticed Life on Mars's Jason O'Mara was in it, so I thought I would give it a try. With no expectations, I actually enjoyed the movie for what it is, an innocent fluff despite the short running time of 91 minutes. Katherine Heigl is adorable and has a sparkling chemistry with Jason O'Mara. Debbie Reynolds steals every scene she is in. Now this movie is never going to win any Oscars with its plot, which has several holes, a not-so-great villain and a predictable ending.

Katherine Heigl does a great job in the lead role, playing her part to perfection. At no point does the movie drag and there's plenty of action and twists and turns in the plot to keep it suspenseful until the end. A number of the negative reviews note that the cast in the movie is inconsistent with their perception of the characters in the book. So, if you've read the book be aware of this. However, let's not forget, when we read a novel we tend to imagine the characters as people we know or at least know of. This is going to be subjective, and it's unlikely that the actors in the movie are going to be like the characters as we imagine them. Such is inevitable and shouldn't detract from our enjoyment of the movie itself.

1400191,A1464Z1X20MD2L,B004EPYZRG,Emily,"[3, 4]","I initially saw this movie when it was out in theaters, having not read any of the Stephanie Plum series at the time.  The movie was my first taste of the SP books--which I immediately located and devoured at my library--and I couldn't be happier that I saw it.  For the most part, it was loyal to the plot of the first book and its characters.  Granted, Grandma Mazur might not have matched the physical description, and her movie personality was on the tame side, but this was the largest character casting flaw.  Likewise, the casting of Joe Morelli might not have been strictly accurate to his physical description in the books, but the acting was spot on and (more important) the chemistry with Stephanie Plum was real.  After reading the books, I was able to appreciate the smaller aspects of the movie I initially overlooked, such as the somewhat minor characters of Mary Lou, Eddie Gazarra, and Jimmy Alpha.  The directors and script writers enhanced Eddie Gazarra's character so that his role in the movie was significantly larger than his role in the book, but this did not detract from the focus Joe Morelli or Ranger commanded.  All were consistent with the book's portrayal of them.Some of the main criticisms about this movie were that Katherine Heigl did not have the correct Jersey accent, the directors did not cast someone who looked physically like Joe Morelli, and Ranger appeared too chatty and not like the physical description of the character.  However, Janet Evanovich herself (a Jersey girl!) thought Katherine Heigl did a great job with the accent, so you can't argue with the creator of the series.  Second, chemistry mattered more to the directors than physical description, so would we have rather seen someone who was a carbon copy of the book Joe Morelli but without the acting abilities or the chemistry between himself and Katherine?  I think we have to trust the casting directors enough to know what they're doing.  As far as the Ranger comments, Ranger's character in the novels is very much described and interpreted by Stephanie for her reader.  That being said, some of his actions and miniscule facial gestures have to be translated into dialogue for the character to seem likeable.  As for the fact that Ranger did not have a ponytail...well, that's not a huge part of his character.  He did cut it off a few books later!Although I loved the movie and was eager to purchase it, I must make a complaint about Amazon's delivery service and customer service.  If you preorder a movie months before it is released, it is reasonable to expect the movie to arrive at your house on the release day.  My movie wasn't even SHIPPED yesterday!  This is not the first time Amazon has been sneaky in this way.  When I attempted to cancel the DVD, multiple times, amazon claimed it could not process my request.  I will continue to buy from amazon, but if you're one of those people who wants an item as soon as it comes out, you're better off spending a few more dollars and buying it at a retail store, such as Target.",5,"Movie was excellent, amazon's service was NOT",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,3048,"['initially', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'out', 'theaters', 'having', 'not', 'read', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', 'series', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'taste', 'SP', 'books', 'immediately', 'located', 'devoured', 'library', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'saw', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'loyal', 'plot', 'first', 'book', 'characters', 'Granted', 'Grandma', 'Mazur', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'matched', 'physical', 'description', 'movie', 'personality', 'was', 'tame', 'side', 'was', 'largest', 'character', 'casting', 'flaw', 'Likewise', 'casting', 'Joe', 'Morelli', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'strictly', 'accurate', 'physical', 'description', 'books', 'acting', 'was', 'spot', 'more', 'important', 'chemistry', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', 'was', 'real', 'reading', 'books', 'was', 'able', 'appreciate', 'smaller', 'aspects', 'movie', 'initially', 'overlooked', 'such', 'somewhat', 'minor', 'characters', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'Eddie', 'Gazarra', 'Jimmy', 'Alpha', 'directors', 'script', 'writers', 'enhanced', 'Eddie', 'Gazarra', 'character', 'so', 'role', 'movie', 'was', 'significantly', 'larger', 'role', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'focus', 'Joe', 'Morelli', 'Ranger', 'commanded', 'were', 'consistent', 'book', 'portrayal', 'them.Some', 'main', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'were', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'correct', 'Jersey', 'accent', 'directors', 'did', 'not', 'cast', 'someone', 'who', 'looked', 'physically', 'like', 'Joe', 'Morelli', 'Ranger', 'appeared', 'too', 'chatty', 'not', 'physical', 'description', 'character', 'However', 'Janet', 'Evanovich', 'Jersey', 'girl', 'thought', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'accent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'creator', 'series', 'Second', 'chemistry', 'mattered', 'more', 'directors', 'physical', 'description', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'carbon', 'copy', 'book', 'Joe', 'Morelli', 'acting', 'abilities', 'chemistry', 'Katherine', 'think', 'have', 'trust', 'casting', 'directors', 'enough', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'As', 'far', 'Ranger', 'comments', 'Ranger', 'character', 'novels', 'very', 'much', 'described', 'interpreted', 'Stephanie', 'reader', 'being', 'said', 'actions', 'miniscule', 'facial', 'gestures', 'have', 'be', 'translated', 'dialogue', 'character', 'seem', 'likeable', 'fact', 'Ranger', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'ponytail', 'well', 'not', 'huge', 'part', 'character', 'did', 'cut', 'off', 'few', 'books', 'later', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'eager', 'purchase', 'must', 'make', 'complaint', 'Amazon', 'delivery', 'service', 'customer', 'service', 'preorder', 'movie', 'months', 'released', 'reasonable', 'expect', 'movie', 'arrive', 'house', 'release', 'day', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'SHIPPED', 'yesterday', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'Amazon', 'been', 'sneaky', 'way', 'When', 'attempted', 'cancel', 'DVD', 'multiple', 'times', 'amazon', 'claimed', 'could', 'not', 'process', 'request', 'will', 'continue', 'buy', 'amazon', ""'re"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'item', 'as', 'soon', 'out', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'spending', 'few', 'more', 'dollars', 'buying', 'retail', 'store', 'such', 'Target']",One For the Money

1400216,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004EPYZRG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","It's trendy to pick on this movie, and who am I to buck a trend? So make room in the bandwagon. To see ONE FOR THE MONEY is to see Janet Evanovich's hopes for a film franchise evaporate like morning dew after sunrise or one's confidence in Katherine Heigl in a non-romcom picture. Janet Evanovich's novels featuring barely competent bounty hunter Stephanie Plum are bestselling stuff, so chances are, once that odor goes away, there'll be another crack at a cinematic adaptation. Because if the Punisher merits second and third chances, why not Stephanie Plum?The quirky premise would've nudged my bump of curiosity, except I was already familiar with the book. Bad cess to Stephanie Plum. She's newly divorced and recently laid off from her lingerie manager post at Macy's, and so the fundamental law of threes made that eviction notice a thing of inevitability. And if you think about it, that she lives in Trenton, New Jersey fulfills the fundamental law of fours.Stephanie Plum is so hard up she takes a dead-end job at her sleazy cousin's bail bond business, never mind that she has no experience whatsoever at skip tracing. But she has gumption and a certain doggedness and an obliviousness to potential danger. Stephanie doesn't waste time with the low-rent FTA (""Failure to Appear"") cases. She sets her sights on the biggest bounty which happens to be her ex-flame Joe Morelli (Jason O'Mara), he to whom Stephanie had once given her cannoli (this is probably a euphemism). Morelli, a cop accused of murder, claims innocence. He's on the lam and desperate to clear his name. Stephanie Plum would rather not be evicted. The chase is on.A middle-of-the-road 2.5 out of 5 stars for ONE FOR THE MONEY. This movie has gotten more trashed than Hefty, more shunned than a smoker in California, more ridiculed than Erik Estrada speaking Spanish in a telenovela. But, dangit, I have got such mad love for Katherine Heigl I don't have it in me to dish dirt on her. I think she did okay stepping outside her purview and I enjoyed her stab at playing the hapless action heroine, even if it took me a minute to adjust to her, um, Jersey accent. Let me instead mention the enervating effect brought on by a shoddy screenplay that weakly adapts and diminishes what was originally a crackling Evanovich read. I don't know that I'm articulating this right, but while there are some funny bits peppered throughout, there's this overall discouraging sitcom-y feel that cheapens the film. And, yeah, okay, maybe Heigl is equally to blame for the lack of chemistry between her and O'Mara. I'm a fan of the books (the earlier ones) and I don't think the PG-13 rating serves Stephanie Plum very well. The movie version of Stephanie is toned down from the saucy badasss recovery agent I'd so relished in literary form. But I like looking at the bright side, so there's this: At least ONE FOR THE MONEY is better than a) that Aniston/Butler mess and b) Erik Estrada speaking Spanish at you.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Making the Money: Behind the Scenes (00:11:00 minutes)- Bond Girls: Kicking Ass in the Bail Bonds Industry- Gag Reel (00:02:36 minutes)- Deleted Scene- Theatrical Trailer",3,"""Does your mother know that you're carrying a gun, Stephanie Plum?!""",1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,3166,"['trendy', 'pick', 'movie', 'who', 'am', 'buck', 'trend', 'So', 'make', 'room', 'bandwagon', 'see', 'ONE', 'FOR', 'THE', 'MONEY', 'see', 'Janet', 'Evanovich', 'hopes', 'film', 'franchise', 'evaporate', 'morning', 'dew', 'sunrise', 'one', 'confidence', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'non-romcom', 'picture', 'Janet', 'Evanovich', 'novels', 'featuring', 'barely', 'competent', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', 'are', 'bestselling', 'stuff', 'chances', 'are', 'once', 'odor', 'away', ""'ll"", 'be', 'crack', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'Punisher', 'merits', 'second', 'third', 'chances', 'why', 'not', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', 'quirky', 'premise', 'would', ""'ve"", 'nudged', 'bump', 'curiosity', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'book', 'Bad', 'cess', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', 'newly', 'divorced', 'recently', 'laid', 'off', 'lingerie', 'manager', 'post', 'Macy', 'so', 'fundamental', 'law', 'threes', 'made', 'eviction', 'notice', 'thing', 'inevitability', 'think', 'Trenton', 'New', 'Jersey', 'fundamental', 'law', 'fours.Stephanie', 'Plum', 'so', 'hard', 'dead-end', 'job', 'sleazy', 'cousin', 'bail', 'bond', 'business', 'never', 'mind', 'experience', 'whatsoever', 'skip', 'tracing', 'gumption', 'certain', 'doggedness', 'obliviousness', 'potential', 'danger', 'Stephanie', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'low-rent', 'FTA', 'Failure', 'Appear', 'cases', 'sights', 'biggest', 'bounty', 'be', 'ex-flame', 'Joe', 'Morelli', 'Jason', ""O'Mara"", 'whom', 'Stephanie', 'had', 'once', 'given', 'cannoli', 'probably', 'euphemism', 'Morelli', 'cop', 'accused', 'murder', 'innocence', 'lam', 'desperate', 'clear', 'name', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'be', 'evicted', 'chase', 'on.A', 'middle-of-the-road', '2.5', '5', 'stars', 'ONE', 'FOR', 'THE', 'MONEY', 'movie', 'gotten', 'more', 'trashed', 'Hefty', 'more', 'shunned', 'smoker', 'California', 'more', 'ridiculed', 'Erik', 'Estrada', 'speaking', 'Spanish', 'telenovela', 'dangit', 'have', 'got', 'such', 'mad', 'love', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'dish', 'dirt', 'think', 'did', 'okay', 'stepping', 'purview', 'enjoyed', 'stab', 'playing', 'hapless', 'action', 'heroine', 'even', 'took', 'minute', 'adjust', 'um', 'Jersey', 'accent', 'Let', 'instead', 'mention', 'enervating', 'effect', 'brought', 'shoddy', 'screenplay', 'adapts', 'diminishes', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'crackling', 'Evanovich', 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'articulating', 'right', 'are', 'funny', 'bits', 'peppered', 'overall', 'discouraging', 'sitcom-y', 'feel', 'film', 'yeah', 'okay', 'maybe', 'Heigl', 'equally', 'blame', 'lack', 'chemistry', ""O'Mara"", ""'m"", 'fan', 'books', 'earlier', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'serves', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'version', 'Stephanie', 'toned', 'down', 'saucy', 'badasss', 'recovery', 'agent', ""'d"", 'so', 'relished', 'literary', 'form', 'like', 'looking', 'bright', 'side', 'least', 'ONE', 'MONEY', 'better', 'Aniston/Butler', 'mess', 'b', 'Erik', 'Estrada', 'speaking', 'Spanish', 'you.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Making', 'Money', 'Scenes', '00:11:00', 'minutes', 'Bond', 'Girls', 'Kicking', 'Ass', 'Bail', 'Bonds', 'Industry-', 'Gag', 'Reel', '00:02:36', 'minutes', 'Deleted', 'Scene-', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer']",One For the Money

When will I learn that movies adaptations from books generally don't work. Here are a few reasons why this one didn't...Katherine Heigl- typically I like her in roles, but I don't think this was a good fit. For someone supposed to be from New Jersey, I had a hard time believing her character. Sure she gave the obligatory few New Jersey-esque catch phrases, but the rest of the dialogue sounded like normal Katherine Heigl. I swear someone said ""learn to say these phrases like this and everyone will believe you're from Jersey"".Storyline- I was actually bored during the movie. I think this might have dealt with not believing Katherine Heigl in the lead role, but I was ready to turn the movie off before making it halfway through. My wife seem to be enjoying it more than I did (a major surprise), otherwise I wouldn't have finished it.Grandma Mazur- From what I remember, this old bird was a bigger part of the story and definitely crazier. She did have a few good scenes (shooting the bird during dinner), but not nearly enough of her went into the movie.This leaves me wondering, if a sequel was made, would I watch it.

Warshawski' vein - but prettier.'Money' has right kind of energy and Heigl has the right kind of moxie as newly born retrieval agent Stephanie Plum. But where the rubber meets the road, in terms of the script, is where this flick loses traction.A lot of that energy is dissipated as various weaker characters steal away the drive that these kinds of movies require. Most obviously: Why is Ranger in the plot at all? I understand that the novels these are based on has Steph torn between whom she's attracted to - but in the film this split interest is emotionally unsatisfying. He doesn't have nearly enough screen time for the audience to make this a true love triangle. Generally, the triangle is very difficult to balance in a scant ninety-minutes of film; few productions do it right. I can think of a half dozen movies from 'The Talk of the Town' to 'Bandits' that tanked simply because the filmmakers soft-pedaled conflicted desire, generally making for poor dramatic narrative.Kind of wished that Director Julie Robinson committed Steph to one side of the street or the other. Meaning she should've completely transformed the character into the leather and hardware FTAs typically employ and enjoy; or pushed Steph's femininity to the max, allowing her to be the goofy sexy girly-girl throughout the film. That she embodied both elements felt artificial and flat.And, even though I'm not from Jersey, I'm familiar enough with regional accents to recognize that Heigl, despite her best efforts, doesn't have it down. I know from experience, listening to non-locals attempting to sound like one only makes it worse. The equivalent of nails on chalkboard.Overall, an improvement over the similar Aniston vehicle 'The Bounty Hunter', and made watchable by a very likable cast, especially a wonderfully hilarious performance by Debbie Reynolds, saving the flick from static fluffdom.Given the to-date fiscal return, I'm sorry that this likely won't produce a sequel. Unfortunate, as I would've paid to screen another effort. There's definitely a seed concept that, properly handled, I believe could develop into something special.",3,A Prettier V.I.

Someone in Hollywood reads maybe a chapter and half and then goes to town and puts a ton of their own ideas in, changes names and does a real hack job on the book we all know and loved.  This DID NOT happen here at all.  The movie exceeded my expectations in every possible way.The basic plot is that Stephanie Plum of Trenton New Jersey has recently (okay---six months ago) lost her job, has a bunch of bills and rent to pay and needs some fast cash.  She blackmails her cousin Vinnie into giving her a job at his bail bonds business as a recovery agent (okay---bounty hunter).  He'd prefer to just assign her the easier stuff (naked flasher ftas) but she wants to go after the big money, trenton cop, Joe Morelli, with whom Stephanie has shared some intimate moments (okay---one intimate moment)in the past.I'm not going to spoil too much with this review, I'm just going to address the things that I would have wanted to know before going to see this film.First, I was not very happy when Katherine Heigl was cast as Stephanie.  I like her, but I don't think she is much of an actress.  She was a great Izzie Stevens, but since then she has mostly played Izzie Stevens.  But, surprisingly, she was goooood in this!  She played Stephanie perfectly, and I will probably have more respect for her as an actress in the future.  Stephanie herself grows up a little through the film.  She becomes more assertive and she tries so hard and she remains cheerful no matter what sort of bad things happen to her.  I don't think we could have recieved a better cinematic treatment of our favorite bounty hunter.The other characters are great as well.  I felt Grandma Mazur was a little too lady-like, I wish she'd been in her track suit, and had seemed a little more Grandma Mazurish, but I hope there will be a sequel or six and we will get to see her develop more.  Morelli and Ranger are exactly what I hoped for.  Vinnie and Connie and Lula were pretty good as well.  You'll see Connie and recognize her instantly---she's entirely faithful to Janet's depiction.  And yes, the man who plays Vinnie does sort of look like a weasel.The only tiny gripe I have was that Ramierz seemed a little too sane in the movie.  I understand that having that subplot in there would have probably extended the movie by at least twenty minutes, but I was so looking forward to him whispering about himself in 3rd person...and he seemed smarter in the movie, being more involved in the Jimmy Alpha operation.  And of course, I wanted more Lula, but the writers were very faithful to the book and Lula was not in the first book very much.  You can't have your cake and eat it too, I guess.The last thing I have to say is that the people who wrote the script obviously spent a lot of time reading the books and there were plently of details in there that a fan will recognize and appreciate.  As Stephanie scrolls through her phone, we see the number for Pino's Pizza, Rex is in her kitchen always running on his wheel, Lula says she'll talk more if Stephanie brings her a snack, Lula tells Jackie it's hot and she's hungry (always), Ranger and Morelli refer to Stephanie as ""Babe"" and ""Cupcake,"" respectively, and there are a lot of other little details that I can't remember just now, but which helped the movie to have the feel of the books.  I love it so much when a movie is adapted this well.  I cannot wait to see this again, and I really hope there are is a sequel which remains as true to the series as this one.  I cannot say enough good things about this movie!  Go and see it soon, it will not dissapoint you.",5,"Sequels, Please!",1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,3671,"['fan', 'books', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'very', 'much', 'know', 'how', 'Someone', 'Hollywood', 'reads', 'maybe', 'chapter', 'half', 'then', 'town', 'ton', 'own', 'ideas', 'changes', 'names', 'real', 'hack', 'job', 'book', 'know', 'loved', 'DID', 'NOT', 'happen', 'here', 'movie', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'possible', 'way.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', 'Trenton', 'New', 'Jersey', 'recently', 'okay', '-six', 'months', 'ago', 'lost', 'job', 'bunch', 'bills', 'rent', 'pay', 'fast', 'cash', 'cousin', 'Vinnie', 'giving', 'job', 'bail', 'bonds', 'business', 'recovery', 'agent', 'okay', '-bounty', 'hunter', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'just', 'assign', 'easier', 'stuff', 'naked', 'flasher', 'ftas', 'go', 'big', 'money', 'trenton', 'cop', 'Joe', 'Morelli', 'whom', 'Stephanie', 'shared', 'intimate', 'moments', 'okay', '-one', 'intimate', 'moment', 'past.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'too', 'much', 'review', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'address', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'know', 'going', 'see', 'film.First', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'happy', 'when', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'was', 'cast', 'Stephanie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'actress', 'was', 'great', 'Izzie', 'Stevens', 'then', 'mostly', 'played', 'Izzie', 'Stevens', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'goooood', 'played', 'Stephanie', 'perfectly', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'more', 'respect', 'actress', 'future', 'Stephanie', 'up', 'little', 'film', 'more', 'assertive', 'so', 'hard', 'cheerful', 'matter', 'what', 'sort', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'recieved', 'better', 'cinematic', 'treatment', 'favorite', 'bounty', 'hunter.The', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'felt', 'Grandma', 'Mazur', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'lady-like', 'wish', ""'d"", 'been', 'track', 'suit', 'had', 'seemed', 'little', 'more', 'Grandma', 'Mazurish', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'six', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'develop', 'more', 'Morelli', 'Ranger', 'are', 'exactly', 'what', 'hoped', 'Vinnie', 'Connie', 'Lula', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Connie', 'recognize', 'instantly', '-she', 'entirely', 'faithful', 'Janet', 'depiction', 'yes', 'man', 'who', 'Vinnie', 'sort', 'look', 'weasel.The', 'only', 'tiny', 'gripe', 'have', 'was', 'Ramierz', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'sane', 'movie', 'understand', 'having', 'subplot', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'extended', 'movie', 'least', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'whispering', '3rd', 'person', 'seemed', 'smarter', 'movie', 'being', 'more', 'involved', 'Jimmy', 'Alpha', 'operation', 'course', 'wanted', 'more', 'Lula', 'writers', 'were', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'Lula', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'book', 'very', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'guess.The', 'last', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'people', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'obviously', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'reading', 'books', 'were', 'plently', 'details', 'fan', 'will', 'recognize', 'appreciate', 'Stephanie', 'phone', 'see', 'number', 'Pino', 'Pizza', 'Rex', 'kitchen', 'always', 'running', 'wheel', 'Lula', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'more', 'Stephanie', 'snack', 'Lula', 'Jackie', 'hot', 'hungry', 'always', 'Ranger', 'Morelli', 'refer', 'Stephanie', 'Babe', 'Cupcake', 'respectively', 'are', 'lot', 'other', 'little', 'details', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'just', 'now', 'helped', 'movie', 'have', 'feel', 'books', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'movie', 'adapted', 'well', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'again', 'really', 'hope', 'are', 'sequel', 'true', 'series', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'Go', 'see', 'soon', 'will', 'not', 'dissapoint']",One For the Money

1400324,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004EPYZRG,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","If you like to read, especially modern mystery novels, then you've heard the name Janet Evanovitch. Evanovitch has made tons of money by writing the best selling series of novels based on her character Stephanie Plum, a young New Jersey girl (completely unlike those seen on JERSEY SHORE) who seeking employment becomes a bounty hunter. Now Plum has made her way to the big screen (and small screens with DVD) and done so in style.Katherine Heigl stars as Stephanie, the hard working New Jersey girl down on her luck with bills to pay and rent owed, looking to find any job available. Visiting her parents and grandmother (one of those kooky type families we all know and love), her mother suggests she talk to her cousin, a bail bondsman. She goes to her cousin to apply for a filing job only to find it's over with but while there is told about collecting bounties on customers that have failed to show. Given a few easy jobs, she thinks she can handle it.One big job Stephanie thinks she can handle is Joe Morelli (Jason O'Mara), an old flame of sorts from high school and now policeman on the run for murder. Most think he's innocent but the law is the law and he's on the run. With the keen insight of knowing his old hangouts and how he acts, Stephanie goes after Morelli...only to find him and then have him toss her keys into a dumpster. This job isn't as easy as she thought.Help arrives with some training. This comes in the form of Ranger (Daniel Sunjata), a professional who knows all the ropes and friend of her cousin's who is willing to spend a little time training Stephanie. The training isn't in depth enough for her to take down public enemy number one, but it does get her enough that she can make her first collar and pick up some cash, learning as she goes.As Stephanie pursues Morelli she discovers more about why he was arrested and what's actually going on. Morelli shot and killed a possible low life but claimed he was armed and that he was knocked unconscious afterward. Rather than wait in a cell for the outcome of his arrest, Morelli skipped bail and is trying to find the real murderer. Morelli's and Stephanie's paths continue to cross and she eventually helps him on the condition that he surrenders once they find the killer so she can collect the paycheck.Along the way Stephanie meets a variety of characters. Lula (Sheri Shepherd) is a street walking prostitute who takes a liking to Stephanie and gives her information when she can. John Leguizamo is Jimmy Alpha, a MMA promoter with a top contender. That contender, Benito Ramirez (Gavin-Keith Umeh) is a vicious fighter with sociopath tendencies that have led him to hurt far too many on the street. Each of these characters and more continue to provide the fledgling bounty hunter with clues as to Morelli's innocence or guilt as well as the identity of the killer. Okay face it, his innocence because the chemistry between the two characters is one of the main points of the film as well as the series of books. For the series to continue he has to be innocent.The fish out of water that learns how to swim concept is worked well with this film and Heigl does a great job. Her combination of real person attractiveness (as opposed to the Hollywood make over style) and portrayal of a person who finds their calling in a round about way makes for a character viewers will not only root for but want to see again. O'Mara has the swagger and sex appeal to make women swoon and want to see more of him as well. And Shepherd turns in a performance that will make you forget all about her time on THE VIEW.The movie isn't one that will make most rush to the store to seek it out. I know I'll hold on to it to watch again, but can't be sure that most people will feel the same. Fans of the books will keep it around. And while the movie did decent box office when it was released, it didn't quite do enough that you'll be seeing a rush to bring the next book in the series to the screen which is unfortunate. With all the drek that is getting made, this could turn out to be a series worth keeping an eye on.

This isn't quite the first time I had seen her in a role like this - there were some similarities to her role in ""Killers [DVD]"" - but bringing an action heroine from a lengthy series of books to the screen is definately an addition to her range.I will be interested to see if this film is successful enough to lead to a film version of any of the sequel books such as ""Two for the Dough (Stephanie Plum 02)"" or ""Three to Get Deadly (Stephanie Plum 03).""At the start of the book, the central character is seriously broke, having recently divorced and also lost her job selling lingerie. Desperate for money, she asks her cousin Vinnie if there are any vacancies in his bail-bond business. There is one opening: as a bounty hunter chasing down people who have jumped bail.Some of the people she has to find and bring in are relatively easy to deal with, but these don't pay the big bucks. The cases which do tend to be dangerous - such as rogue cop Joe Morelli (Jason O'Mara) - who has skipped bail after being accused of murder.Plum has some old romantic history with Morelli and insists on going after him, even though he is a tough target, way out of the league of a novice bounty hunter. She gets some good advice from experienced bounty hunter Ranger (Daniel Sunjata) but soon finds herself in serious difficulty from some very dangerous people who are also taking an interest in the case. But Stephanie is one girl who is not going to give up easily ...Also stars Debbie Reynolds in a hysterically funny performance as Plum's grandmother and Sherri Shepherd, an equally funny performance as a streetwalker who is one of her sources of information.Tight acting and plotting kept the length of the film down to 91 minutes with a good mix of action and comedy, and there was a lot of excellent acting. The chemistry between Heigl and O'Mara was excellent, but her scenes with Daniel Sunjata also crackled with life, so much so that I seriously wondered whether the end to the film would show or hint at Plum forming a romantic attachment to Ranger or Morelli.Great fun, well worth watching, and although this is based on a series regarded as ""chick-lit"" Katherine Heigl's performance is charming enough that men who watch this with their wives or girlfriends will probably enjoy it as much as their partners do.",4,Amusing screen adaptation of the first Stephanie Plum novel.,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,2753,"['had', ""n't"", 'previously', 'read', 'Janet', 'Evanovitch', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', 'novels', 'watching', 'amusing', 'film', 'adaptation', 'first', 'one', 'One', 'Money', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', '01', 'will', 'be', 'giving', 'try.I', 'had', 'seen', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'who', 'novice', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', 'Doctor', 'Izzie', 'medical', 'comedy', 'dramaGrey', 'Anatomy', 'Season', '1-7', '[', 'DVD', ']', 'large', 'number', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'such', 'as27', 'Dresses', '[', 'DVD', ']', '[', '2008', ']', ""n't"", 'quite', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'seen', 'role', 'were', 'similarities', 'role', 'Killers', '[', 'DVD', ']', 'bringing', 'action', 'heroine', 'lengthy', 'series', 'books', 'screen', 'definately', 'addition', 'range.I', 'will', 'be', 'interested', 'see', 'film', 'successful', 'enough', 'lead', 'film', 'version', 'sequel', 'books', 'such', 'Two', 'Dough', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', '02', 'Three', 'Get', 'Deadly', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', '03', 'start', 'book', 'central', 'character', 'seriously', 'broke', 'having', 'recently', 'divorced', 'also', 'lost', 'job', 'selling', 'lingerie', 'Desperate', 'money', 'cousin', 'Vinnie', 'are', 'vacancies', 'bail-bond', 'business', 'one', 'opening', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'chasing', 'down', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'jumped', 'bail.Some', 'people', 'find', 'bring', 'are', 'relatively', 'easy', 'deal', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'big', 'bucks', 'cases', 'do', 'tend', 'be', 'dangerous', 'such', 'rogue', 'cop', 'Joe', 'Morelli', 'Jason', ""O'Mara"", 'who', 'skipped', 'bail', 'being', 'accused', 'murder.Plum', 'old', 'romantic', 'history', 'Morelli', 'insists', 'going', 'even', 'tough', 'target', 'way', 'league', 'novice', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'good', 'advice', 'experienced', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Ranger', 'Daniel', 'Sunjata', 'soon', 'serious', 'difficulty', 'very', 'dangerous', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'taking', 'interest', 'case', 'Stephanie', 'one', 'girl', 'who', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'up', 'easily', 'Also', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'performance', 'Plum', 'grandmother', 'Sherri', 'Shepherd', 'equally', 'funny', 'performance', 'streetwalker', 'who', 'one', 'sources', 'information.Tight', 'acting', 'plotting', 'kept', 'length', 'film', 'down', '91', 'minutes', 'good', 'mix', 'action', 'comedy', 'there', 'was', 'lot', 'excellent', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'Heigl', ""O'Mara"", 'was', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'Daniel', 'Sunjata', 'also', 'crackled', 'life', 'so', 'much', 'seriously', 'wondered', 'end', 'film', 'would', 'show', 'hint', 'Plum', 'forming', 'romantic', 'attachment', 'Ranger', 'Morelli.Great', 'fun', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'based', 'series', 'regarded', 'chick-lit', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'performance', 'charming', 'enough', 'men', 'who', 'watch', 'wives', 'girlfriends', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'partners', 'do']",One For the Money

There was a movie that I hated a few years ago called ""The Bounty Hunter"", with Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler. I felt like that film was as contrived as could be, and was unfunny, unromantic and incredibly unconvincing. I hate to say that ""One for the Money fell into that same ball park.One of the reasons why I love the book, ""One for the Money"", by Janet Evanovich is because its heart, Stephanie Plum was an unapologetic badass, profane and saucy. I always pictured someone like Sandra Bullock playing the lead role, a born-and-raised Jersey girl who was down on her luck, who finds her inner badass through a series of misadventures, but ultimately comes out on top in the end.I don't necessarily blame Katherine Heigl for ruining this movie. She did the best she could, even though her Jersey accent is laughably bad. She was simply miscast. She should have never discontinued her work on ""Grey's Anatomy, because if these are the kinds of roles she's getting, her future's only going to get worse.Julie Ann Robinson (""The Last Song"") directed, who I blame for the movie's obviously unclear vision. You get the idea that she didn't know what she wanted this movie to be. Maybe she thought that after all of the books that had been written, fans don't remember the first chapter of the franchise. Did she and the rest of the filmmakers intend this to be a film franchise as well? You get the idea that no one really cared, given the film's messy ending and sitcom-y writing.Liz Brixius (Nurse Jackie), Karen McCullah Lutz (Legally Blonde) and Kristen Smith (The Ugly Truth) are responsible for the travesty of a screenplay. Women ARE funny. There have been so many funny and smart movies that had primarily female writers, actors and directors, so why does this film seem misogynist? It's a mixed message, and an implication that I really don't like. Their version of Stephanie Plum is an idiot. She's not a saucy badass, like the one I loved in the books. Her profanity is turned down, too, because of the meaningless desire that the filmmakers must have had to get a PG-13 rating. Why would kids want to see this movie? Oh, of course...Katherine Heigl's inevitable ""sideboob"".I enjoy the work of Liz Brixius, considering that she is the creator of one of my favorite shows, ""Nurse Jackie"". She has shown over the years that she knows how to properly illustrate complicated characters. She is not beyond character development, and making characters fully realized...so what went wrong here? Why didn't she scream at the other two writers, ""what the hell are you doing?!""I can only imagine how bad true fans of the books felt about this travesty. There are eighteen Stephanie Plum novels, plus short stories, novellas and crossovers. People clearly like this character, and there have got to be a bunch of true fans out there. The first book was written in 1994, and there was talk of a movie then. It had been in development hell since then, and it's a shame to say that it probably should have stayed there.Grade: D+",2,"I wanted to love ""One for the Money"".

I liked Katherine Heigl in the role of Stephanie, the out of work lingerie salesman turned bondsman.  She was sexy, sassy, and funny without trying too hard.  Heigl seems to get away with these roles of being the ""fall girl"" like 27 Dresses, Knocked Up, and now this.  I liked the other actors as well even though most of them were unknowns to me.  Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur was pretty funny but it seemed like she was making too much of an effort to be humorous.  I had pictured someone more wiry, older, and more natural to the role. Morelli's role was spot on character although I'm not familiar with the actor.  I think he showed Morelli's macho, devious, sexy, but definitely out for justice and getting the bad guy cop side.  Ranger was good also as he introduces Stephanie to the gun shooting, lock picking side of bale bonsmanship.

Honestly, I think this series would have been better served to be adapted for TV, due to the large cast and the tone. The books have an over-the-top style that is by turns ridiculously funny and unflinchingly gritty. Kind of like a Ryan Murphy series. The movie adaptation took a tone more reminiscent of 'crime in the city' flicks from the 80's - not a bad model actually, but fans of the books will notice the feel is different. There is just not enough running time to get to know this large cast of characters very well, and even though the exposition is taken directly from the books in the voice-overs, there is still too much of it. The conversations with Mary Lou could have been cut completely, as they didn't serve even as well as the voice-overs to elucidate for non-book fans what was going on. And then the villain does that classic 'allow me to regale you with my dastardly plans' thing at a really unlikely moment. Well, that's the bad. The good is that Katherine Heigl and Jason O'Mara have excellent chemistry as Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli, and Daniel Sunjata ably fills out the black camos of Ranger. The rest of the cast is great too. I appreciate Heigl playing Stephanie as an everywoman with extraordinary chutzpah. If you haven't read the books, Stephanie is a down-on-her-luck lingerie buyer who turns to her cousin Vinnie for a job in a moment of desperation. Vinnie is a bail bondsmen, and he gives her a chance to bring in some easy FTA's for money. Only, Stephanie spots a man who done-her-wrong on the list (Morelli) and in spite of the fact that he is way too big a fish for a beginning angler to pursue, she only wants him (hence the title).

What bothered me was the total lack of depth in the characters and the huge plotting flaws.On the first point, we see Ms Plum go from a clerk at Macys to a bounty hunter with no discernible effort. The writers at least could have given us the typical montage showing her reading up on arrest technique, practicing with her (highly illegal) snubnose revolver, and trying her hand at lock picking to explain her sudden proficiency at all these skills.The plot itself was weak and full of holes. Do the authors really think that 'hookers with hearts of gold' roam the streets of Trenton? And that the first two she happens upon conveniently know all about the person she's looking for?And why, for pity's sake would anyone smuggle large amounts of heroin into NJ by boat when they could land it anywhere else and simply drive it in?Also a mystery is why a licensed and professional bounty hunter and 'security professional' (Ranger) would even consider making a false firearm purchase for a total stranger, when it would land him in jail as soon as the firearm was found on her (NJ has very strict registration laws). Why would he even talk to her at all, and encourage what could only be considered a suicide mission that was bound to get him in trouble or sued?I also loved how it was specifically remarked upon (twice) that her revolver was a 'five shot', yet she never shot less than 7 rounds from it at a time.The description of this movie on Amazon was also dead wrong. In what world they would consider this 'family friendly' I don't know. Within the first 10 minutes she's being told 'there's better ways to earn a living on your knees'. Explain that to the kids (or have them explain it to grandma).That all being said, it was a relatively fun movie to watch, and the star is definitely easy on the eyes, even if she's not going to win a Best Actress anytime soon.

I am NOT, however, a Heigl fan; even when I used to watch ""Grey's"" to me she was always a second-rate actress, plus seemed very vain and narcissistic a person in interviews.But being a HUGE fan of Stephanie, of Jason O'Mara, and of Daniel Sunjata - I decided to give the film a shot, and was pleasantly surprised.  Heigl was quite good in capturing Stephanie Plum's character, humor, and sarcasm, and in the relationships with her parents and grandmother (Debbie Reynolds - they should have utilized her even more).  I think this was my first time seeing O'Mara in a comedic role, and thought him quite admirable - but I so do NOT get the backlash against Daniel Sunjata as Ranger; to me, with the limited role written for him in the film, I thought he was the perfect choice; masculine, in control, personable yet with a slight air of danger about him, and certainly he fit the part physically.  Again, just with they'd utilized him/the character a bit more!The plot involves Stephanie Plum - a divorced, former lingerie buyer in Trenton, NJ - and her desperate search for a new job to pay the many, MANY past-due bills piling up in her apartment.  In total desperation, she turns to her slightly shady cousin Vinnie (Patrick Fischler, another hugely underrated actor), who runs a bail bonds office, in search of a clerical job.  Instead, as she's in need of BIG money fast, she takes on becoming a recovery agent instead - her eye on the prime assignment of finding and bringing in rogue cop Joe Morelli, now accused of gunning down a man in cold blood and who also happens to be someone Stephanie boffed once in high school ... and someone she now cannot stand, as he ditched her right after they slept together.The rest of the film concerns her comic attempts at bringing Joe in, along with other assignments she takes along the way to pay some bills ... as Stephanie inadvertently also begins to unravel the puzzle surrounding Joe's possible innocence, even as she ticks off a whole lot of VERY dangerous men in doing so.Not a classic, by any means, but I really liked the characters and humor, plus found the film both engaging and easily watchable (I actually got caught up in the story, even knowing what was going to happen).  Heigl and O'Mara, as well as Heigl and Sunjata, bounce well off each other on-screen, and while the film may come off as a bit of fluff it was still just plain old fun to watch.And ANY film that can make me actually like Heigl's as an actress is worth watching alone.",4,"Expected a disaster -but pleasantly surprised, and Sunjata makes a GREAT Ranger!",1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2632,"['Wow', 'wide', 'range', 'reviews', 'here.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'first', 'few', 'Plum', 'books', 'love', 'character', 'spirit', 'novels', 'am', 'NOT', 'however', 'Heigl', 'fan', 'even', 'when', 'used', 'watch', 'Grey', 'was', 'always', 'second-rate', 'actress', 'seemed', 'very', 'vain', 'narcissistic', 'person', 'interviews.But', 'being', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'Stephanie', 'Jason', ""O'Mara"", 'Daniel', 'Sunjata', 'decided', 'give', 'film', 'shot', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Heigl', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'capturing', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', 'character', 'humor', 'sarcasm', 'relationships', 'parents', 'grandmother', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'should', 'have', 'utilized', 'even', 'more', 'think', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'seeing', ""O'Mara"", 'comedic', 'role', 'thought', 'quite', 'admirable', 'so', 'do', 'NOT', 'get', 'backlash', 'Daniel', 'Sunjata', 'Ranger', 'limited', 'role', 'written', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'masculine', 'control', 'personable', 'yet', 'slight', 'air', 'danger', 'certainly', 'fit', 'part', 'physically', 'Again', 'just', ""'d"", 'utilized', 'him/the', 'character', 'bit', 'more', 'plot', 'Stephanie', 'Plum', 'divorced', 'former', 'lingerie', 'buyer', 'Trenton', 'NJ', 'desperate', 'search', 'new', 'job', 'pay', 'many', 'MANY', 'past-due', 'bills', 'piling', 'up', 'apartment', 'total', 'desperation', 'slightly', 'shady', 'cousin', 'Vinnie', 'Patrick', 'Fischler', 'hugely', 'underrated', 'actor', 'who', 'bail', 'bonds', 'office', 'search', 'clerical', 'job', 'Instead', 'need', 'BIG', 'money', 'fast', 'becoming', 'recovery', 'agent', 'instead', 'eye', 'prime', 'assignment', 'finding', 'bringing', 'rogue', 'cop', 'Joe', 'Morelli', 'now', 'accused', 'gunning', 'down', 'man', 'cold', 'blood', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'someone', 'Stephanie', 'boffed', 'once', 'high', 'school', 'someone', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'ditched', 'right', 'slept', 'together.The', 'rest', 'film', 'comic', 'attempts', 'bringing', 'Joe', 'other', 'assignments', 'way', 'pay', 'bills', 'Stephanie', 'inadvertently', 'also', 'unravel', 'puzzle', 'surrounding', 'Joe', 'possible', 'innocence', 'even', 'whole', 'lot', 'VERY', 'dangerous', 'men', 'doing', 'classic', 'means', 'really', 'liked', 'characters', 'humor', 'found', 'film', 'engaging', 'easily', 'watchable', 'actually', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'even', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'Heigl', ""O'Mara"", 'as', 'well', 'Heigl', 'Sunjata', 'bounce', 'well', 'other', 'on-screen', 'film', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'bit', 'fluff', 'was', 'still', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'fun', 'watch.And', 'ANY', 'film', 'can', 'make', 'actually', 'Heigl', 'actress', 'worth', 'watching', 'alone']",One For the Money

The author has deliberately made her heroine inept, incompetent and a perpetual victim.  Plum is an insult to real life women who cannot afford the luxury of being perpetually ""cute.""  Thankfully the movie doesn't dumb Stephanie down as much as the author does but, still, the movie blows.  The film is about a woman who becomes a bounty hunter.  She is totally incompetent and succeeds by blind luck only. I like Katherine Heigle and she did breathe some humility and character into the Stephanie Plum role but the best thing about the movie was (surprisingly) Jason O'Mara as Morelli.  He took the role and chewed right through it, bringing energy and sexuality to it. But what happened with Ranger?  In fairness to Daniel Sunjata, he had larger than life shoes to fill.  When Ranger enters a room all heads are supposed to turn.  Sunjata's Ranger was just another guy with the exception he was wearing a Kevlar vest.  Sunjata has the acting chops to portray Ranger (he portrayed ""Frankie"" in the defunked FX tv series ""Rescue Me"") but for some reason he played Ranger as a talkative almost sensitive guy.  Not Ranger and not cool. I was expecting so much more from him.  The movie itself follows the first book in the series faithfully. If you are a fan of the books you will probably love this movie.

With her car repossessed, the down-on-her-luck Stephanie takes a job at her cousin Vinnie's bail bonds office, even though she doesn't know how to use a gun. Then Stephanie chases after Joseph Morelli (Jason O'Mara), a disgraced vice cop on the run, with whom she had a relationship in high school.That ""One for the Money"" was released after a similar romantic comedy ""The Bounty Hunter"" (with the main characters' genders reversed) may have something to do with the film's failure at the box office. Even so, with an interesting premise that has potential, ""One for the Money"" could have been better, something more entertaining like ""Midnight Run.""The biggest problem with ""One for the Money"" is that the movie is so middling. It is half-baked as a comedy, action, romance or anything. Slick and fast-paced as it is, the film always feels like something is missing. The relationship between Stephanie and Ranger (Daniel Sunjata), her charismatic mentor/partner bounty hunter, is not fully explored: neither is her friendship with Lula (scene-stealing Sherri Shepherd). John Leguizamo is wasted in a role that should be bigger, and so is Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur.""One for the Money"" is not bad as some critics might lead you to believe. It is just tame.
