721685,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00006RCN8,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[10, 14]","""Angela"" was not your average film. It was a strong opening from Rebecca Miller, the spawn of playwright Arthur Miller and film vixen Marilyn Monroe, but where it suffered was that it felt too amateurish. Without biting my tongue ""Angela"" began impressively, strong opening with a family's move to a new home. The defined mother/father characters (albeit eerily similar references to Marilyn Monroe), two strong girl leads that seem to have genuine chemistry together, and an undefined era which allowed my imagination to flourish and ponder ignited ""Angela"" immediately. It was when the film moved into its second and third act, where it became alarmingly obvious that Miller was loosing her grasp on not just the film crew, but also the convoluted story itself. Visions of Lucifer, the Virgin Mary, a diluted neighbor, and the big elephant in the room - religion - seem to take priority over such important elements like character development, questionable motive, and family dynamics. Miller places so much focus on these symbolic references that this quality film begins to slip through her fingers. By the second act, where the two daughters embark on their own journey through this unknown town, which again is bombarded with referenced evils and unknown symbolism, that reality gets surpassed by a director who would rather shock than impress. The entire scene with the possible pedophile could have been an intense and memorable scene, but instead it falls short, because Miller is so focused on getting us to Lucifer that we only recognize this scene as a small blip on the radar. Again, I don't want to sound pessimistic about this film, Miller began with such a strong eye that I thought this was going to be an instant classic, but by the dull ending, ""Angela"" is so muddled that empathy towards the characters becomes greater than excitement for the film.While our characters constantly have to play second fiddle to the symbolic religious references throughout the film, I must admit that they were eerie and interesting throughout bits and segments. Miller had a strong cast, a father who gave up everything for his family, a mother lost in her head (especially well played), and two daughters searching for meaning was an amazing dynamic - poorly defined - but amazing all the same. What I had hoped Miller would do was make these four characters the central focus of the story, but alas, it doesn't happen. The struggle between father/mother again are second to the religious symbolism, thus we lack the apparent emotion towards them. When all of these characters get to their final moments, we just don't care any further. We have given up. A scene was needed where the family reunites over a crisis that nearly tore them apart - clich&eacute;? - I believe it would have strengthened the characters and transformed this film from a simply symbolic picture into a family drama. While ""Angela"" was the obvious lead character, all of these in the immediate family were worthy (and powerful) enough to watch equally. They all carried their weight well, one just wishes we could have spent more time with them.Finally, an issue needs to be addressed with this film that was neither mentioned in the audio commentary nor in many posts about this film, but when a director cannot clean up or recognize that a boom mic has made it into at least five scenes (extremely apparent) than something is wrong. One cannot say that this film is superb with technical failures happening all over the place. This is your blood and soul when you create a film; why not present it like it was a wrapped Christmas gift, not like it was just found in the sandbox? That small issue really lowered the standard for this film, making it just another amateurish independent film created by someone who carries a famous last name.Overall, I wanted to like ""Angela"", I wanted to sit here and say that I was impressed with Miller's first outing, but alas, I wasn't. It was such a powerful opening, but it floundered so quickly. Miller's focus on the religious element, while defining for Angela, deeply ruined the rest of the characters. The family became a shadow, with no real emotion surrounding them, but instead reacting to the beliefs of Angela. I was drawn into Angela's mother's story, but received no gratification or explanation. I loved her father's desire to be a good dad, but again, sitting in a circle or becoming baptized was more important. I was misled by the goals, and consequently missed the ""why"" and ""how"" for the final act. Coupled with the laughable errors by the crew (this should have been an introduction to the first day of using a boom mic), ""Angela"" just fell through the cracks. It perhaps was the obvious borrow from ""Gummo"" or just the drowning of symbolism, but ""Angela"" will remain - for me - another independent film trying to make its mark. I am eager to see ""Personal Velocity"" if only to observe if Miller successfully saw the errors and made the corrections. ""Angela"" was a first draft film, with much needed corrections and red markings in the margins.Grade: ** out of *****",3,The Devil & Ms. Miller,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,5104,"['Angela', 'was',

721686,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B00006RCN8,Artist & Author,"[4, 5]","There are two issues in this movie.  The first is of a couple of little girls growing up with a mentally ill mother.  Angela, in her immaturity, feels at least a bit responsible for her mother's situation.  She wants to be especially good, feeling that it is her 'badness' that keeps her mother sick.  This is very common.  One girl our family has grown to love as one of our own daughters understood that it was after her mother got pregnant with her the schizophrenia manifested itself in her mother.  So, when she was little, she felt she caused it to happen.Angela has some idea of God and satan, Heaven and hell, but it is as a ten-year-old might have understood it.  It would have been nice to see where she had gotten such ideas.  Still, Angela wants very much to be a good person, and keep her little sister, Ellie, good.  However, she is still a little girl.  Parents could show this film to their own children, watching together, and use it to discuss the family beliefs regarding these topics.  It is a movie one won't soon forget, and one that will leave you thinking about it for some time after seeing it.This is a very intense movie (and there is one rather explicit sex scene).  Still, my nine-year-old granddaughter handled it very well (we fast-forwarded through the short sex scene).  I presented the story to her as one example of what might cause some kids to act in ways that her 'in group' does not think is 'cool.'  We had a good discussion about how she should treat such kids because the ones she may meet might be going through the same type of thing, though the specifics may be different, as Angela in their home.  If a parent knows their child is dealing with such a friend, this movie would be a great way to help them open up about how they feel about the 'strange' kid, and for parents to teach understanding and even compassion for him or her.

721689,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B00006RCN8,Brian E. Erland,"[5, 6]","Released in '95 `Angela' plays like a lazy, dreamy summer's day lying around the house watching the curtains sway in the gentle breeze and scattered rays of sunlight dance around the room. You know what I mean, one of those days when dreams and fantasies weave their way into the waking world making every moment magical and filled with possibility.Angela lives in such a world of her own making as she desperately attempts to escape the reality of living with a chronically depressed Mother and a family dissolving before her adolescent eyes. Seeing no other avenues to consider she looks for a way to solve her problems through a divine intervention.In her intensely hypnogogic world nothing is what it seems to be. Lucifer lives in the basement of the family house, the Virgin Mary lurks outside the bedroom window and the elderly woman next door who walks constantly back and forth to her mail box looking for a letter that never comes is an angel.This is a film filled with southern, backwoods atmosphere and understated meaning that does a superb job at blurring the boundary lines between, the real and the imagined, the sacred and the mudane. Definitely not for everyone but if you occasionally enjoy a little something off the beaten path you might want to give `Angela' a try.

In it, we have two pre-teen sisters who are trying to deal with the mental state of their mother, which is getting worse and worse with each passing day. Their father is an endearing man, although a bit permissive, and does his best to hold the rocky family together.The film takes a strange turn into what many conclude is our protagonist's (a girl named Angela) own slide into mental illness. I'm not sure that's the case, as I find reason to believe some aspects of her visions might have very well been true, but the point is that she's a tormented soul and finds escapism through a vivid imagination and a self-made quest that frees her mind from what's currently happening. This is a quest for purification from the evil of the world, one that she brings her sister along for the ride, and one that finds a handsome, peaceful Lucifer as their largest obstacle. He simply states to her on numerous times, ""I want you, Angela"" in a very gentle, yet thouroughly dark way.Eventually, Angela's quest, with her young sister at her side, takes her across the back roads of her town.

This movie touches just about every human emotion we have. It is almost like a fairy tale adapted to a modern setting. The acting is superb, the music quirky in a good way, and the photography is excellent. Yes, there are some ""sophmore moments"" with boom Mics but overall the strong story and acting more than make up for these very minor mistakes.What makes this movie so special is the young actress who plays Angela. Miranda Stuart Rhyne is so effortless in her part that I am completely at a loss to explain how she could NOT have been nominated for some sort of award. I have never seen such an ethereal and haunting performance from any other ""child actor"". You look at Dakota Fanning or Jodie Foster and nether of them have the same sort of screen presence that Miranda has. And there is something about her that is almost magical. In various parts of the movie she doesn't even look like the same person. In part this is due to different hairstyles, makeup, clothes etc. but I have never a seen a movie where a single actor's face could look so different from scene to scene. I have never seen anything like this with any other actor/actress...ever. Sadly, her career as an actress pretty much ended after this movie (only a few bit parts and a couple of shorts). Her touching portrayal of a girl coping with the horror of a family ripped apart (n this case by mental illness) will touch a deep and troubled chord in a LOT of people.If I had to grab just a handful of DVDs for my ""desert island collection"" this one would be included.

Fans of David Hamilton may especially apperciate the artistic visuals of the young star, Angela, and her younger sister.This film requires an open mind and one who apperciates all colors of art from darkness to light.It brings you through the very real private journeys and experences of a young girl becoming a young woman. As with most girls at the character's age, Angela becomes isolated from her family and friends in order to find the answers to her inner questions on her own.Many of the scenes are somber and distubring but beautiful.The plot, in short, is about a eleven or twelve year old girl named Angela living with her sister and Mother in rural America.  Throughout the film, she is engrossed in her own journey to discover how she might gurantee her place in Heaven someday. The more she searches the more obsessed this quest becomes.  She soon finds herself in a world of angels and demons fighting for her soul.Meanwhile, her Mothers becomes mentally ill. This too becomes a part of Angela's quest for understanding and finding her salvation. All the while, her young sister, five or so, stays timidly at her side, quietly attempting to make sense of her family's challenges and sister's fasination with another world.The film invites you into the dark place that exists in every young woman's search for idenity and place.",5,A dark odyssey of a tween's quest toward's self enlightment,1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,1447,"['provocative', 'rare', 'example', 'when', 'American', 'art', 'combines', 'American', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'Fans', 'David', 'Hamilton', 'may', 'especially', 'apperciate', 'artistic', 'visuals', 'young', 'star', 'Angela', 'younger', 'sister.This', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'one', 'who', 'colors', 'art', 'darkness', 'light.It', 'brings', 'very', 'real', 'private', 'journeys', 'experences', 'young', 'girl', 'becoming', 'young', 'woman', 'most', 'girls', 'character', 'age', 'Angela', 'becomes', 'isolated', 'family', 'friends', 'order', 'find', 'answers', 'inner', 'questions', 'own.Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'somber', 'distubring', 'beautiful.The', 'plot', 'short', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'named', 'Angela', 'living', 'sister', 'Mother', 'rural', 'America', 'film', 'engrossed', 'own', 'journey', 'discover', 'how', 'might', 'gurantee', 'place', 'Heaven', 'someday', 'more', 'more', 'obsessed', 'quest', 'becomes', 'soon', 'world', 'angels', 'demons', 'fighting', 'soul.Meanwhile', 'Mothers', 'mentally', 'ill', 'too', 'part', 'Angela', 'quest', 'understanding', 'finding', 'salvation', 'while', 'young', 'sister', 'five', 'so', 'stays', 'timidly', 'side', 'quietly', 'attempting', 'make', 'sense', 'family', 'challenges', 'sister', 'fasination', 'world.The', 'film', 'dark', 'place', 'young', 'woman', 'search', 'idenity', 'place']",Angela

However when I watched this I was treated to a wonderfully woven tell of heaven and hell and the personal tragedies that this family goes through. The mother in this film is seriously mentally ill. She is not a bad person but her decline in sanity effects Angela and her sister. All they want if for their mother go get better and for them to be a happy family again. Angela is basically trying to keep her little sister safe and help both of them to become better people so that their mom can get better. The children involve themselves in many rituals like making a circle out of toys. Toward the end Angela finds hope in being Baptized properly would make her a good girl and she takes her sister out to the water. This was a well crafted movie exploring what was going in the children's minds. After they moved they live next door to a woman who is quite ill herself very obsessive compulsive, she goes almost in a trance to the mail box at all hours of the night. Angela seeks information from this woman as to how to get closer to god. I could see this film being enjoyed by those who seek out child nudity but the scenes were tasteful and not pornographic.

Angela is truly a superior film and it exceeeded my expectations.  The storyline took a sad turn with the mental instability of Angela's mother and how she had to be placed in an institution.  However, I was  more than uplifted by the job done by the girl who played Angela and how she kept seeking God and Heaven.  Miranda Stuart Rhyne's performance was most enchanting.  This is the best movie that I have bought from Amazon to date.  I really felt for Angela as she fought her nightmares and kept on her spiritual journey.  I will watch this movie again and again and that is not something that I do very often.
