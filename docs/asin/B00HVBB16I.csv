Tennant has 1000% more charm, personality, and yes, even sex appeal(so I've been told by the ladies). It's a ton of fun to see him as the new doctor in ""The Christmas Invasion"", even if he is absent for most of the episode, his awakening makes the whole experience so fun and worthwhile.Where this first half shines is also in episodes such as ""School Reunion"". Longtime fans of Doctor Who might want to break out the Kleenex as they see their old friend Sarah Jane Smith and the ever lovable K-9 coming back to kick some Krillitane butt. Okay, that's not the Doctor's way, but you get the idea.Another great standalone episode is the epic Victorian themed ""The Girl in the fireplace"". There are definitely elements here that may have gone on to inspire the wonderful character arc of Amelia Pond throughout her sublime journey with the Doctor. Perhaps the episode was meant to foreshadow that in a way, and like the design of many aliens/robots/machines/etc on Doctor who, everything is epic and conveys a staggeringly amazing use of imagination with just a sprinkle of whimsy here and there.Things get emotional in the two parter ""Rise of the Cybermen"" and ""The Age of Steel"". The Doctor, Mickey and Rose end up in an alternate reality where Rose discovers her father is still alive. If you remember the heart breaking episode from the first season where Rose tries to save her father, then this two-parter in an alternate universe is likely to have you reaching for an abundant supply of Kleenex.David Tennant was for me the Doctor who said ""It's okay to love me. I don't mind!"". His impervious charms and his quick wit would serve this series well. I give this series five stars because honestly, for this price, you're getting your lovely allowance of vitamin D.",5,A much better season with a much better actor in the Doctor's shoes,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,1861,"['view', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Doctor', 'far', 'better', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'ever', 'did', 'Tennant', '1000', '%', 'more', 'charm', 'personality', 'yes', 'even', 'sex', 'appeal', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'ladies', 'ton', 'fun', 'see', 'new', 'doctor', 'Christmas', 'Invasion', 'even', 'absent', 'most', 'episode', 'awakening', 'whole', 'experience', 'so', 'fun', 'worthwhile.Where', 'first', 'half', 'shines', 'also', 'episodes', 'such', 'School', 'Reunion', 'Longtime', 'fans', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'might', 'want', 'break', 'out', 'Kleenex', 'see', 'old', 'friend', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Smith', 'ever', 'lovable', 'K-9', 'coming', 'back', 'kick', 'Krillitane', 'butt', 'Okay', 'not', 'Doctor', 'way', 'get', 'idea.Another', 'great', 'standalone', 'episode', 'epic', 'Victorian', 'themed', 'Girl', 'fireplace', 'are', 'definitely', 'elements', 'here', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'inspire', 'wonderful', 'character', 'arc', 'Amelia', 'Pond', 'sublime', 'journey', 'Doctor', 'Perhaps', 'episode', 'was', 'meant', 'foreshadow', 'way', 'design', 'many', 'aliens/robots/machines/etc', 'Doctor', 'who', 'everything', 'epic', 'conveys', 'staggeringly', 'amazing', 'use', 'imagination', 'just', 'sprinkle', 'whimsy', 'here', 'there.Things', 'get', 'emotional', 'two', 'parter', 'Rise', 'Cybermen', 'Age', 'Steel', 'Doctor', 'Mickey', 'Rose', 'end', 'up', 'alternate', 'reality', 'where', 'Rose', 'father', 'still', 'alive', 'remember', 'heart', 'breaking', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'Rose', 'save', 'father', 'then', 'two-parter', 'alternate', 'universe', 'likely', 'have', 'reaching', 'abundant', 'supply', 'Kleenex.David', 'Tennant', 'was', 'Doctor', 'who', 'said', 'okay', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'impervious', 'charms', 'quick', 'wit', 'would', 'serve', 'series', 'well', 'give', 'series', 'five', 'stars', 'because', 'honestly', 'price', ""'re"", 'getting', 'lovely', 'allowance', 'vitamin', 'D']",Doctor Who: Series Two: Part 1

I wanted to add some Dr Who to my DVD collection but I didn't want to spend a lot on those older box sets. The pricing on these DVD's are wonderful under 20 bucks for 2 discs of 7 episodes. The only drawback is the special feature.Its a 24 minute making of Season 2 Part 1 and its underwhelming, they just touch on each episode for 5 minutes.I look forward to buying Season 2 Part 2 and Season 3 Parts 1 and 2. I just hope Season 4 gets this treatment as well.",5,Allons-y,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,647,"['was', 'so', 'happy', 'randomly', 'stumble', 'new', 're-release', 'Season', '2', 'Part', '1.Unlike', 'previous', 'release', 'had', 'season', '2', 'Season', '2', 'two', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'sets', 'wanted', 'add', 'Dr', 'Who', 'DVD', 'collection', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'lot', 'older', 'box', 'sets', 'pricing', 'DVD', 'are', 'wonderful', '20', 'bucks', '2', 'discs', '7', 'episodes', 'only', 'drawback', 'special', 'feature.Its', '24', 'minute', 'making', 'Season', '2', 'Part', '1', 'underwhelming', 'just', 'touch', 'episode', '5', 'minutes.I', 'look', 'forward', 'buying', 'Season', '2', 'Part', '2', 'Season', '3', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'just', 'hope', 'Season', '4', 'treatment', 'as', 'well']",Doctor Who: Series Two: Part 1

This set is two discs, and included the first have of season 2 of Doctor Who, including the Christmas special.  You get half the season, and 1 new special feature.  What you don't get is all the plethora of special features that are included in the full set.  This is why the set is only 2 discs, as they are pretty much just filled with the episodes.  Whether you have any interest in the special feature or not really depends on your taste.  If you've been wanting to add the show to your collection for awhile, but didn't want to spend the high price of the full season sets, this is a great option.  I'd recommend it to people who are looking for an inexpensive alternative to the full sets, and who don't have much interest in the special features.",5,Cheaper Alternative To Regular Sets,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,890,"['So', 'interest', 'helping', 'decision', 'purchase', 'not', 'thought', ""'d"", 'inform', 'everyone', 'what', 'set', 'set', 'two', 'discs', 'included', 'first', 'have', 'season', '2', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'including', 'Christmas', 'special', 'get', 'season', '1', 'new', 'special', 'feature', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'plethora', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'full', 'set', 'why', 'set', 'only', '2', 'discs', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'filled', 'episodes', 'have', 'interest', 'special', 'feature', 'not', 'really', 'taste', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wanting', 'add', 'show', 'collection', 'awhile', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'high', 'price', 'full', 'season', 'sets', 'great', 'option', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'inexpensive', 'alternative', 'full', 'sets', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'interest', 'special', 'features']",Doctor Who: Series Two: Part 1
