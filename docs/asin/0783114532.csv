I hate explicit sex, violence, and inaccurate information protrayed in storylines and I am not looking to be merely entertained.I am a ""big fan of Christopher Walken"", and I find him to be somewhat captivating in certain roles he protrays, but, some of the movies he has been in leaves a lot less to be desired and what a waste of good talent. Did any of you feel that Chris and the other actors represented the character roles accurately? What year was this storyline representing? I did not care much for amazon's synopsis of this movie.Folks, if you are going to critique a movie, especially a movie that has not been viewed by the general populace,please give more of a indepth review of the storyline. I would love to know as much as possible about the mainelements of the storyline. Did any of you read the book? Did any of you feel that the writer, producer, and director achieve the main focal point of what the movie was suppose to be about? What do you feel that they could have done to make the storyline more believable? Bigotry and racism is an age old problem, especially in the U.S. and nothing is being done about it, did the writer and or producer address any of the issues which the immigrants were facing? Why not?I have stage 4 renal cancer and severe heart disease and cannot get out of the house to go anywhere anymore, so, I depend heavily on your movie reviews and critiques. Please also give reviews about the time element in the screenplay and weather or not it was historically accurate, correct and consistent. Was this movie about labordisputes for un-documented immigrants? I hope that I do not come across as a nut but I love history and issues oncivil rights.I love reading some of your reviews. I wish that I could read my books but the cancer has destroyed a good part of my body including my eyes. I purchase a lot of movies from amazon based upon some of your reviews and I am not one who invest money on garbage. I am looking for a bite of accurate history in films as well the entertainment factor, which really is not that important to me.Please give a good synopsis of the storyline, acting, and the time period. I hope I am not offending anyone. If Iam please accept my apologies. I really wanted to purchase this film, but, after reaading the reviews, I am not certain.

43182,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,0783114532,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[8, 15]","African-Americans and Jews were not the only ethnic groups to bear the brunt of violent, narrow-minded bigotry in the land of the free.  In the late 19th century, Italians in New Orleans were lynched for a trumped up charge based on the pure greed of the ""city fathers"".  Greed, said Gordon Gecko in the movie Wall Street, is good.  Wrong, Gordon.Greed is corruption. Corruption is inextricably and inevitably linked to violence.  When some people are greedy, other people get hurt.  Or die.  That's what happened.  This made-for-HBO film, Vendetta, is a well thought out depiction of the events culminating in the terrible slaughter of Italians at that time.  Although Christopher Walken is the marquis player--and he is, as usual, really good--credit should also go to the supporting players, all of whom were well cast here.  Kenneth Welsh, Edward Herrmann, Bruce Davison, Clancy Brown, Richard Libertini, and the younger actors whose roles are the Provenzano brothers and Gaspare Marchese are all excellent.Many people, including myself (Jewish), did (or do) not know about this horrific event.  It is to HBO's credit that they dramatized this telefilm under the direction of Nicholas Meyer (The Seven-Percent Solution, The Day After).  Credit should also go to writer Timothy Prager whose script is rock solid.  HBO has produced many well-crafted cable TV films and this is certainly one of them.Will greed in America ever go away?  This film says no.  And I think that's true.  It will certainly continue to be in place with the man currently running things in a white office that not quite circular, circa 2005. He's not a tree, he's a (fill in the blank).Definitely recommended.",4,America--home of the brave and the bigoted,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,1686,"['African-Americans', 'Jews', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'bear', 'brunt', 'violent', 'narrow-minded', 'bigotry', 'land', 'free', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'Italians', 'New', 'Orleans', 'were', 'lynched', 'trumped', 'up', 'charge', 'based', 'pure', 'greed', 'city', 'fathers', 'Greed', 'said', 'Gordon', 'Gecko', 'movie', 'Wall', 'Street', 'good', 'Wrong', 'Gordon.Greed', 'corruption', 'Corruption', 'inextricably', 'inevitably', 'linked', 'violence', 'When', 'people', 'are', 'greedy', 'other', 'people', 'get', 'hurt', 'die', 'what', 'happened', 'made-for-HBO', 'film', 'Vendetta', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'depiction', 'events', 'culminating', 'terrible', 'slaughter', 'Italians', 'time', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'marquis', 'player', 'usual', 'really', 'good', 'credit', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'supporting', 'players', 'whom', 'were', 'well', 'cast', 'here', 'Kenneth', 'Welsh', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Richard', 'Libertini', 'younger', 'actors', 'roles', 'are', 'Provenzano', 'brothers', 'Gaspare', 'Marchese', 'are', 'excellent.Many', 'people', 'including', 'Jewish', 'did', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'horrific', 'event', 'HBO', 'credit', 'dramatized', 'telefilm', 'direction', 'Nicholas', 'Meyer', 'Seven-Percent', 'Solution', 'Day', 'Credit', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'writer', 'Timothy', 'Prager', 'script', 'rock', 'solid', 'HBO', 'produced', 'many', 'well-crafted', 'cable', 'TV', 'films', 'certainly', 'one', 'them.Will', 'greed', 'America', 'ever', 'go', 'away', 'film', 'think', 'true', 'will', 'certainly', 'continue', 'be', 'place', 'man', 'currently', 'running', 'things', 'white', 'office', 'not', 'quite', 'circular', 'circa', '2005', 'not', 'tree', 'fill', 'blank', '.Definitely', 'recommended']",N/A

Vendetta is based on a true story of corruption and bigotry that took place in the late 19th century New Orleans. After watching this DVD I am really surprised the movie did not fare better at the box office. The characters all played their parts well, the scenery is good etc. One thing that is not factual however is using the abbreviation for ""With Out Papers"" as during the time the movie took place, immigrants had no papers to be without. Immigration was federalized in 1890 and it took many years for a standard of naturalization to be set in place. Probably around 1906 when the Bureau of Immigration & Naturalization was established. Up until this time naturalization was handled in the courts and many records up to this time was merely handwritten forms stamped and tossed into a drawer or cabinet at the court house.
