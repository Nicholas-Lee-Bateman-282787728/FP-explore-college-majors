1395578,A1J3SZFWI8YV64,B004BR83KC,"John Duda ""TV John""","[20, 20]","I don't know if this show was ever aired in Australia, but it reminds me of a cartoon show I used to watch avidly every Saturday, which was titled ""Calvin and the Colonel"", and the cartoon is a spin off from the amos 'n' andy show. I've viewed one disc so far, and the shows are recorded from the best high quality tapes. The quality improves as you go from episode to episode. The first episode is clear, but looks kinda tired, and by the time you get to the fifth episode the picture and sound quality improve remarkably, and you'll have to adjust the sound volume down by the time you start watching that episode. The product manufacturing and the presentation is top notch, and the discs play well in my machines, and they have an easy to follow picture menu for each episode on the disc.I am very pleased with the product itself, and even more pleased with the show amos 'n' andy as each actor in the show is brilliant and most believable. The scripts are very funny and the actors pull of the jokes extremely well and calmly. A lot of the scripts were written by Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher, who produced and wrote the 'Leave It To Beaver' and 'The Munsters' TV Shows. So if you also like those shows as I do, then you are sure to love 'The Amos 'n' Andy Show! Great entertainment for the whole family. Now in my own view it seems that Sydney Fields who wrote the Abbott & Costello Radio Program Shows, along with the complete first season of 'The Abbott & Costello' TV Show, and also played the boys landlord along with the character Melonhead, would of been influenced by 'The Amos 'n' Andy Show', as the same formula is used in each of the shows. So if you like great classic comedy shows, then you will definitely enjoy 'The Amos 'n' Andy Show'. For the price you can't go wrong. This package and show definitely achieve a 5 star rating, and thanks for producing it and making it available to International buyers, cheers!",5,Smile & laugh along with a nostalgia show,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,1932,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'show', 'was', 'ever', 'aired', 'Australia', 'cartoon', 'show', 'used', 'watch', 'avidly', 'Saturday', 'was', 'titled', 'Calvin', 'Colonel', 'cartoon', 'spin', 'amos', 'n', 'andy', 'show', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'one', 'disc', 'so', 'far', 'shows', 'are', 'recorded', 'best', 'high', 'quality', 'tapes', 'quality', 'go', 'episode', 'episode', 'first', 'episode', 'clear', 'kinda', 'tired', 'time', 'get', 'fifth', 'episode', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'improve', 'remarkably', ""'ll"", 'have', 'adjust', 'sound', 'volume', 'down', 'time', 'start', 'watching', 'episode', 'product', 'manufacturing', 'presentation', 'top', 'notch', 'discs', 'play', 'well', 'machines', 'have', 'easy', 'follow', 'picture', 'menu', 'episode', 'disc.I', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'product', 'even', 'more', 'pleased', 'show', 'amos', 'n', 'andy', 'actor', 'show', 'brilliant', 'most', 'believable', 'scripts', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'actors', 'pull', 'jokes', 'extremely', 'well', 'calmly', 'lot', 'scripts', 'were', 'written', 'Joe', 'Connelly', 'Bob', 'Mosher', 'who', 'produced', 'wrote', ""'Leave"", 'Beaver', 'Munsters', 'TV', 'Shows', 'So', 'also', 'like', 'shows', 'do', 'then', 'are', 'sure', 'love', ""'The"", 'Amos', 'n', 'Andy', 'Show', 'Great', 'entertainment', 'whole', 'family', 'Now', 'own', 'view', 'Sydney', 'Fields', 'who', 'wrote', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Radio', 'Program', 'Shows', 'complete', 'first', 'season', ""'The"", 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'TV', 'Show', 'also', 'played', 'boys', 'landlord', 'character', 'Melonhead', 'would', 'been', 'influenced', ""'The"", 'Amos', 'n', 'Andy', 'Show', 'same', 'formula', 'used', 'shows', 'So', 'like', 'great', 'classic', 'comedy', 'shows', 'then', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', ""'The"", 'Amos', 'n', 'Andy', 'Show', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'package', 'show', 'definitely', 'achieve', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'thanks', 'producing', 'making', 'available', 'International', 'buyers', 'cheers']",Amos & Andy Show All 74 Complete Dvd Set

The sad part is that the masters or first generation copies do exist (but where are they)because every time I've seen an excerpt from a show on a documentary they are near perfect quality.  This makes them nuch more enjoyable to watch. While this particular collection boasts digital restoration there are many episodes that are of poor quality.  However some are good quailty and many fall in between.  For the price though you are not being cheated.  The bottom line is that once you start watching these great actors you can't stop laughing.
