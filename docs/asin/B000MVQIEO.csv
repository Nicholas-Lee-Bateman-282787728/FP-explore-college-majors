This and Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  The series shared many of the same supporting actors, and even touched on similar themes just in very different ways.By now most people know the overall story.  It is set around a group of teens in New England.  It was very much a teen soap opera that revolved around will Dawson and Joey ever get together, then will Joey choose Dawson or Pacy.  That part of it got tired, and frankly a little old because it was literally dragged out to the very end.  But where the series shined was when it dealt with issues like mental illness, coming out, drug use, adultery and the effects of it, etc.  It was a show that for its time pushed a lot of boundaries, and dealt with subjects that you did not see on prime time TV a lot before that.The discs were just what you got in the individual seasons all in one box.  Apparently the early packaging was really bad.  When I bought this, it basically was packaged so it opened like a book and you had 10 disks stacked together on one side, and 9 on the other.  Not the greatest, but there were no scratches or discs that would not play.  The extra features were pretty sparse.  Some behind the scenes stuff in the first couple seasons, but not much from the later ones. You do get the complete extended edition of the series finale, the best part of which was Jen's storyline.  Apparently some of the music from the series what changed from what was on TV originally.  This happens a lot, especially with older series where there is a lag time between the show airing and the DVDs being put out.  It is due to licensing and there is nothing that can be done of the entity holding the rights does not let the song(s) to be put on the DVD.  I personally did not remember all the songs from when it aired on TV, but I will admit I only watched it casually back then.  But the choice was either replace songs or not put the show out on DVD at all.It is a show that by today's standards is pretty tame and a little cheesy. But if you were a fan of the show then it is definitely worth getting.",5,A great series,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,2214,"['Chances', 'are', 'were', 'recently', 'high', 'school', 'mid', 'late', '1990s', 'watched', 'one', 'series', 'aimed', 'demographic', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'series', 'shared', 'many', 'same', 'supporting', 'actors', 'even', 'touched', 'similar', 'themes', 'just', 'very', 'different', 'ways.By', 'now', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'overall', 'story', 'set', 'group', 'teens', 'New', 'England', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'teen', 'soap', 'opera', 'revolved', 'around', 'will', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'ever', 'get', 'together', 'then', 'will', 'Joey', 'choose', 'Dawson', 'Pacy', 'part', 'got', 'tired', 'frankly', 'little', 'old', 'was', 'literally', 'dragged', 'out', 'very', 'end', 'where', 'series', 'shined', 'was', 'when', 'dealt', 'issues', 'mental', 'illness', 'coming', 'out', 'drug', 'use', 'adultery', 'effects', 'etc', 'was', 'show', 'time', 'pushed', 'lot', 'boundaries', 'dealt', 'subjects', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'prime', 'time', 'TV', 'lot', 'that.The', 'discs', 'were', 'just', 'what', 'got', 'individual', 'seasons', 'one', 'box', 'Apparently', 'early', 'packaging', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'When', 'bought', 'basically', 'was', 'packaged', 'so', 'opened', 'book', 'had', '10', 'disks', 'stacked', 'together', 'one', 'side', '9', 'other', 'Not', 'greatest', 'were', 'scratches', 'discs', 'would', 'not', 'play', 'extra', 'features', 'were', 'pretty', 'sparse', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'not', 'much', 'later', 'ones', 'do', 'get', 'complete', 'extended', 'edition', 'series', 'finale', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'Jen', 'storyline', 'Apparently', 'music', 'series', 'what', 'changed', 'what', 'was', 'TV', 'originally', 'lot', 'especially', 'older', 'series', 'where', 'lag', 'time', 'show', 'airing', 'DVDs', 'being', 'put', 'out', 'due', 'licensing', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'entity', 'holding', 'rights', 'not', 'let', 'song', 's', 'be', 'put', 'DVD', 'personally', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'songs', 'when', 'aired', 'TV', 'will', 'admit', 'only', 'watched', 'casually', 'back', 'then', 'choice', 'was', 'either', 'replace', 'songs', 'not', 'put', 'show', 'out', 'DVD', 'all.It', 'show', 'today', 'standards', 'pretty', 'tame', 'little', 'cheesy', 'were', 'fan', 'show', 'then', 'definitely', 'worth', 'getting']",N/A

I have all the seasons in the original release boxes but as I have watched these dvds over and over they are starting to show wear and I would like to replace my entire collection. I have held off because I am hoping these will either come out on Blu Ray or with a digital copy option for my ipod, as I would love to have my Dawson's creek with me wherever I go. If you loved the show like I did, you will not be disappointed with buying them on dvd to enjoy over and over.",5,Great show ... nice that the complete series is all together but what about Blu Ray or Digital copies?,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,604,"['rated', '5', 'stars', 'show', 'so', 'great', 'think', 'worth', 'buying', 'either', 'complete', 'set', 'individual', 'seasons', 'have', 'seasons', 'original', 'release', 'boxes', 'have', 'watched', 'dvds', 'are', 'starting', 'show', 'wear', 'would', 'like', 'replace', 'entire', 'collection', 'have', 'held', 'off', 'am', 'hoping', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'digital', 'copy', 'option', 'ipod', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'Dawson', 'creek', 'wherever', 'go', 'loved', 'show', 'did', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'buying', 'dvd', 'enjoy']",N/A

Like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" and ""ER"" - it was a story that I absored every week.In 1998 when the series premiered on the now defunct ""the wb"" I was 10 years old.  But having been helped raised by my much older siblings I had an afenity for the older crowd.  After ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" moved to her new night, I stayed and watched a new world open up in front of me.""Dawson's Creek"" may not have been the first teen soap, or maybe even the best.  But it was the first one I was ever exposed to - and the one I watched throughout my teenage years.  I might not have understood it the first time around the block (a second viewing several years later proved just how nave I had been throughout several storylines) - but it is a series that remains, even to this day - timeless.  It is the story of innocence evolving into adulthood.... What happens when emotion, passion, hormones, and social standing begin to define who we are?""Dawson's Creek"" traced the lives of five high school friends from their very first day of High School until the middle of college.  It chronicled their scholastic achievements, romantic fallies, hormonal hijinx, and unique perspectives.  For 128 episodes millions were glued to their TV's every Wednesday night to watch the next installment.  And as an audience we grew up with these characters.Sony is collecting together all 128 episodes in one box set.
