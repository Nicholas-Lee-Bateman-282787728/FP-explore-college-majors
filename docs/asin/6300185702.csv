206101,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6300185702,Byron Kolln,"[0, 0]","Like my fellow reviewers have noted, BLONDE VENUS is a melodrama that really shouldn't work as well as it does.  The recipe for it's success lies solely with Marlene Dietrich.  Teamed with her greatest director, Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS comes alive with lots of pathos and drama chiefly because of Dietrich and her dedicated performance.When her husband (Herbert Marshall) is struck down with a potentially-fatal illness, housewife and mother Helen Faraday (Dietrich) reluctantly returns to the music-hall stage in order to fund his medical journey to Europe.  Separated from her husband, Helen finds comfort in the arms of a kind millionaire (Cary Grant).Although we never quite buy the extremely tawdry nature of Dietrich's character, in BLONDE VENUS she got to play a devoted mother--her scenes with child star Dickie Moore are a joy--and we can recognise the immense humanity and charm which she exuded naturally in real life.  BLONDE VENUS displays Dietrich as the glamorous sex goddess (she sings the classic ""Hot Voodoo"" while dressed in a gorilla costume), but she also manages to connect on a motherly, maternal level with her character, who is very much a woman trapped between two worlds, never really sure of how to connect them in order to reconcile her past with her present.If you enjoy Marlene Dietrich (plus the early roles of Cary Grant), BLONDE VENUS is for you!",4,delightful Dietrich drama,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,1390,"['fellow', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'BLONDE', 'VENUS', 'melodrama', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'recipe', 'success', 'solely', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'Teamed', 'greatest', 'director', 'Josef', 'von', 'Sternberg', 'BLONDE', 'VENUS', 'alive', 'lots', 'pathos', 'drama', 'chiefly', 'Dietrich', 'dedicated', 'performance.When', 'husband', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'struck', 'down', 'potentially-fatal', 'illness', 'housewife', 'mother', 'Helen', 'Faraday', 'Dietrich', 'reluctantly', 'music-hall', 'stage', 'order', 'fund', 'medical', 'journey', 'Europe', 'Separated', 'husband', 'Helen', 'comfort', 'arms', 'kind', 'millionaire', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'never', 'quite', 'buy', 'extremely', 'tawdry', 'nature', 'Dietrich', 'character', 'BLONDE', 'VENUS', 'got', 'play', 'devoted', 'mother', 'scenes', 'child', 'star', 'Dickie', 'Moore', 'are', 'joy', 'can', 'recognise', 'immense', 'humanity', 'charm', 'exuded', 'naturally', 'real', 'life', 'BLONDE', 'VENUS', 'Dietrich', 'glamorous', 'sex', 'goddess', 'classic', 'Hot', 'Voodoo', 'dressed', 'gorilla', 'costume', 'also', 'connect', 'motherly', 'maternal', 'level', 'character', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'woman', 'trapped', 'two', 'worlds', 'never', 'really', 'sure', 'how', 'connect', 'order', 'reconcile', 'past', 'present.If', 'enjoy', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'early', 'roles', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'BLONDE', 'VENUS']",N/A
206102,A77184QJM3PM,6300185702,"C. Tolley ""Chris Tolley""","[10, 11]","This film really shouldn't work. The story line is too far-feched, the songs too silly, the star too goregeous when supposedly a vagabond. BUT, it Does work, astoundingly, and the reason is that star, Marlene Dietrich. No other could pull this role off. She's both smolderingly sexy and maternal. Vamp, and housewife. Devoted mother, and kept woman. Pleny of contradictions here, and yet she moves through the film as the glue that holds the whole mess together. Of course, the part that this film is famous for is the ""Hot Voodoo"" number, where Dietrich emerges out a gorilla costume with native girls swaying in time in the background. What nerve! Nobody today would dare anything like that. Herbert Martshall is cast as the husband, and Cary Grant, in am early role, is cast as the swank lover. All it takes is a bit of suspension of disbelief, for some parts, anyway, and this is a movie to enjoy.Actually, having just watched the film again for the first time in a while, I was struck by Dietrich's presence in the film. I've always considered Dietrich one of the most under-rated actresses of Hollywoods golden era. She seemed very involved and into her role here. Her scenes with little Dicky Moore, her son in the movie, were very touching and sincere. I'm no acting expert by any stretch, but I feel she was wonderful in this role. Perhaps it was the going against type role of mother that turned off many critics of the day. She was, after all, one of the most glamorous and seductive creatures to ever hit Hollywood, so perhaps thinking of her as a loving mother and housewife could perhaps seem to be a stretch. However, Dietrich carried off the role, and carried the movie totally without effort. Watch the film yourself, and see how under-rated this fine actress really was.",5,Hot Voodoo!,1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,1788,"['film', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'story', 'line', 'too', 'far-feched', 'songs', 'too', 'silly', 'star', 'too', 'goregeous', 'when', 'supposedly', 'vagabond', 'BUT', 'Does', 'work', 'astoundingly', 'reason', 'star', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'other', 'could', 'pull', 'role', 'off', 'smolderingly', 'sexy', 'maternal', 'Vamp', 'housewife', 'Devoted', 'mother', 'kept', 'woman', 'Pleny', 'contradictions', 'here', 'yet', 'film', 'glue', 'whole', 'mess', 'together', 'course', 'part', 'film', 'famous', 'Hot', 'Voodoo', 'number', 'where', 'Dietrich', 'out', 'gorilla', 'costume', 'native', 'girls', 'swaying', 'time', 'background', 'What', 'nerve', 'Nobody', 'today', 'would', 'dare', 'anything', 'Herbert', 'Martshall', 'cast', 'husband', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'am', 'early', 'role', 'cast', 'swank', 'lover', 'bit', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'parts', 'anyway', 'movie', 'enjoy.Actually', 'having', 'just', 'watched', 'film', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'while', 'was', 'struck', 'Dietrich', 'presence', 'film', ""'ve"", 'always', 'considered', 'Dietrich', 'one', 'most', 'under-rated', 'actresses', 'Hollywoods', 'golden', 'era', 'seemed', 'very', 'involved', 'role', 'here', 'scenes', 'little', 'Dicky', 'Moore', 'son', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'touching', 'sincere', ""'m"", 'acting', 'expert', 'stretch', 'feel', 'was', 'wonderful', 'role', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'going', 'type', 'role', 'mother', 'turned', 'off', 'many', 'critics', 'day', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'glamorous', 'seductive', 'creatures', 'ever', 'hit', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'perhaps', 'thinking', 'loving', 'mother', 'housewife', 'could', 'perhaps', 'seem', 'be', 'stretch', 'However', 'Dietrich', 'carried', 'role', 'carried', 'movie', 'totally', 'effort', 'Watch', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'under-rated', 'fine', 'actress', 'really', 'was']",N/A

But strangely, that sleepy morning was one of the most warm and pleasurable of my life.  Don't ask me just why, but then and there all the ingredients for magic simply clicked.&quot;Blonde Venus,&quot; like so many of Sternberg's films, has been frequently called an excercise in style over substance.  I would have to disagee, though the style is of course sumptuous, I would say rather it was a triumph in substance over story, if that can be.  In spite of an undeniably soap opera style plot, it can also not be denied its empathy and emotion, generated in no small part by Marlene Dietrich.  It is impossible to say just how, but Dietrich in this film has done something truly unique.  She has managed to be at one time smolderingly sexy, and yet tender and warm, maternally comforting.  These traits should be a natural contradiction, but somehow she subtly blends them, making one seem unthinkable without the other.It is not a great film, yet it is wonderful.  Coupled remarkably well with &quot;Suzy,&quot; &quot;Blond Venus&quot; gave me a light and wonderful morning of escapist magic.

He saw that the dragon was protecting a princess taking a bath (Marlene Dietrich). He was taken by her beauty, but she asked him to go away. He asked for one wish, to see her again. Later he saw her at the theater, and she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. The two went walking that night, had their first kiss, and decided to get married.Perhaps this isn't the real story of the couple's first meeting, but it makes a sweet bedtime story for their son (Dickie Moore). Unfortunately, the happy family is soon to be broken up. Marshall is sick due to the radiation he works with in his job. To be cured, he needs $1500 and has no way of obtaining it himself. His wife decides to go back into the theater and makes a swell debut as the ""Blonde Venus"" with her savage ""Hot Voodoo"" number. She catches the eye of a wealthy playboy (Cary Grant) who funds her husband's expedition, though he does not know this. When he finds out, she and her son go into hiding so that the family will not be separated.It is strange to see Dietrich in such a role, but highly entertaining. Her acting style is very different than someone like Joan Crawford who would have been very sentimental in the part. Dietrich is, but in her own way with few exaggerated facial expressions. Marshall is great as the husband, a refined man whose anger burns inwardly. Grant is amusing in his early role, very different than in his later screwball comedies. Moore is wonderful. He is peppered throughout the film doing cute things that children do; he really endears himself to the audience well.The directing is fabulous.

206108,A315WMPERH1S0Z,6300185702,Tee,"[3, 4]","BLONDE VENUS is a major Hollywood production masquerading as a loony ""cult"" movie. This jaw-dropping mix of mother love, sex melodrama, and androgynous musical numbers looks more like a Von Stroheim film than a Von Sternberg. Marlene Dietrich stars as a German showgirl who marries cultivated peeping tom Herbert Marshall and moves to America to becomes the most glamorous housewife in the tenants of New York. Years into the marriage, scientist Marshall becomes contaminated with a potentially fatal poisoning through exposure at work and needs $1,500 to go off to Germany for experimental treatments so Marlene decides to return to work in nightclubs and without as much as raising a exquisitely plucked eyebrow bewitches both a agent and a nightclub owner into immediately pushing her to singing stardom at top dollar, neither of whom bother to ask her to sing as much as a note to audition. At the nightclub, Ms. Marlene wows one and all with her Harvey Fierstein-like vocals, none more than multi-millionaire glamour boy Cary Grant who within hours has written Dietrich a check for the full $1,500 without her having to as much unbutton one button on her costume (imagine what she could have gotten had she been friendlier!) Marshall is on the next boat out to Germany and it doesn't take long for Cary to get something for his money. Herbert's potentially fatal illness is almost instantly cured and he shows up back in town earlier than the Mrs. expected - who when confronted, confesses all and wants to resume their old storybook marriage. Marshall however refuses and demands sole custody of their son which sees Lili Marlene fleeing with kid in tow as they hop it to one low dive after another across America with Marshall in pursuit.To catalog the absurdity in this melodrama would take a few pages from Dietrich's full makeup job after some time skinny-dipping to her apartment in Texas which appears to be a boarding room/chicken coop with Marlene essaying a Garboesque detachment at all times from her split-second transformation from loving wife to predatory mistress to flophouse femme fatale. She's every bit as absurd as the movie - and like the film, she's amazingly effective. Herbert Marshall in the male lead has little more to do than be academic and anemic while Cary Grant as second choice comes off better in one of his major film roles as the too-good-to-be-true sugar daddy, young, handsome, and generous although he does have one of the least believable knockout punches in screen history.The usually appealing child actor Dickie Moore alas is a disaster as the Marshall spawn - his slangy speech delivery makes him a most incredible child of Marshall and Dietrich - and at almost seven seems several years too old for this part which has him sleeping in a crib (!!) in an early scene and being coddled throughout the film by Dietrich as if he were three or four. Cary Grant has stated von Sternberg gave him no help with his performance and apparently he didn't help Dickie either, who baby talks his way through the film in worst precious-movie-kid fashion.The film score is so loud and dramatic during Dietrch and Marshall's final confrontation at the old apartment, you expect to find Ann Savage strangled with a phone cord in the next room.

Blonde Venus is a story with a typical love triangle: a beautiful wife, who gave up her career for marriage, a decent but not very fascinating husband, and Cary Grant as a lover [you get the picture here].  But this film is not all clear-cut, e.g. husband is not completely dull,  lover is not completely ruthless, and the wife....well, the wife is Marlene  Dietrich, which in itself is not typical. It is surreal, to see her as a  devoted mother and a wife.  Dietrich performs some great stage numbers, but  still manages to look &quot;motherly&quot; in couple of shots.Blonde  Venus is definitely a Marlene Dietrich vehicle, with occasional long shots  of young  Cary Grant [simply standing there and being absolutely gorgeous].
