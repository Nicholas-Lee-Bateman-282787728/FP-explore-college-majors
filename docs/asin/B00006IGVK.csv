The main character Nitz is someone that really irritates me, he has no personality and isn't funny, coincediantelly none of his friends are very funny either. I saw the premire of this show when it was on MTV, but stopped watching after the 2nd episode, recently Ive seen about 5 other episodes on Comedycentral and ahve concluded that unless the 5 or so episodes that are on the dvd are totally unlike the rest  of the series this is definetely a waste of money, and buying the South Park or Family Guy dvd's would be a much much wiser descision. Just to get a sense of how this show isn't good the creator got it on the air because he won a contest, I'm serious, worst of all the shows theme song is buy Good Charlotte and the creatoor makes a bunch of references to them with the characters which he voice, I guess the person who made this is exactly the kind of person who I don't like and who are roining the entertainment industry. Again get the Family GUy or South Park DVD's instead, if you are corious about the show try renting at a place that carries DVDs of tv series, but I don't reccimend you do.",2,There's a good reason this show only lasted one season,1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,1178,"['Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'other', 'reviewers', 'show', 'not', 'great', 'main', 'character', 'Nitz', 'someone', 'really', 'personality', ""n't"", 'funny', 'coincediantelly', 'none', 'friends', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'saw', 'premire', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'MTV', 'stopped', 'watching', '2nd', 'episode', 'recently', 'Ive', 'seen', '5', 'other', 'episodes', 'Comedycentral', 'ahve', 'concluded', '5', 'so', 'are', 'dvd', 'are', 'totally', 'rest', 'series', 'definetely', 'waste', 'money', 'buying', 'South', 'Park', 'Family', 'Guy', 'dvd', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'much', 'wiser', 'descision', 'Just', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'show', ""n't"", 'good', 'creator', 'got', 'air', 'won', 'contest', ""'m"", 'serious', 'worst', 'shows', 'theme', 'song', 'buy', 'Good', 'Charlotte', 'creatoor', 'bunch', 'references', 'characters', 'voice', 'guess', 'person', 'who', 'made', 'exactly', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'who', 'are', 'roining', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'Again', 'get', 'Family', 'GUy', 'South', 'Park', 'DVD', 'instead', 'are', 'corious', 'show', 'try', 'renting', 'place', 'DVDs', 'tv', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'reccimend', 'do']",Undergrads: Season 1

I was excited to once again see this show, but as soon as I got to the second disc it wouldnt play.  I tried it on three different dvd players and one blu ray player, but it kept freezing up.  So I decided to buy one from amazon thinking that maybe from a different seller the dvd might work. Well I was wrong. Again I had problems with the second  disc freezing up. It strange since the disc doesn't have any scratches. I guess their must be a bad batch of dvds. I sent back the amazon set and got my money back. I wonder if anyone else has had the same problem?

I was amazed to find out Pete Williams, the creator, was only about 19 when the show was first conceived.  It will certainly speak most to the Generation Y crowd, but I have to admit I was surprised at how similar the experiences shared by Nitz et al were to my own college years (1981-85--OK, no computers yet, and Star Wars was still in its infancy and not yet a full-blown cult).The extras are pretty nice, too, I enjoyed the character bios.  Pete is rather awkward on camera but he's fun to listen to as he talks about his creation.Seeing that final optic, ""2080 hours to sophomore year,"" is a cruel joke, because, of course, sophomore year never came.

716579,A2XWU6Y8PF8L17,B00006IGVK,"CreepyT ""CreepyTendencies""","[30, 32]","I must admit that this show didn't quite grab my attention at first glance.  The first couple of episodes seemed somewhat humorous, but also rather mediocre and lackluster.  The characters appeared more annoying than intriguing, and the plot was rather drab and boring.  However, once the show got going, it really grew on me until I found myself wanting more of the queer quartet.  Now I feel sadly unsatiated at the lack of further seasons.The episodes center around four high school friends who have moved on to college and are undergoing their freshman trials and tribulations.  Rather than focus on academia, the show chooses to focus it's attention on dorm and social life, which, to some, is far more interesting anyway.  Nitz is the central character, and he's also the most likeable, down-to-earth of the bunch.  He spends his time attempting to win the heart of a girl who loves another.  Rocko is the stereotypical jock/burnout/frat boy of the group, who spends too much time staring at the bottom of a bottle and communicating with the hallucinogenic manifestations such a pastime brings.  Cal is Nitz's roommate and quite the ladies man, though one must wonder why.  Gimpy is by far my favorite character, being the hermitic shut-in with the band of followers and an impressive infatuation with Star Wars (not to be confused with Star Trek).  Then there's Kimmy, Nitz's star-crossed love interest, and Jesse, the girl who's always there to pick up the broken pieces.Together this group sets out in search of themselves amidst all the wonders of college life including parties, fake ID's, bars, prank week, the naked run, and a huge spring break bash, and in the end they'll discover that life still presents many lessons to be learned.With so many of the animated cartoon shows aired today geared towards younger age groups, it's rather refreshing to see a show that the college age group can identify with.  Unfortunately, it seems as though many great television shows are cancelled far too early on, and therefore never get the chances they deserve.  This show will be sorely missed.  Luckily, though, the first and only season is available on DVD for our viewing pleasure.  If you a enjoy Daria, Beavis and Butthead, or even South Park (though there is slightly less bathroom humor present in this show than in those later two mentioned), then give Undergrads a try as well.

I think this show is one of the more realistic tv shows to come out and the way they based it on a less popular charecter is what makes it illusive to watch.

I know it's sad, but this show is truly, unashamedly funny and at a few key moments, absolutely hysterical (see the episode ""Risk"" if you don't believe me).What makes this show work is its unflinching satire.  Every kind of school stereotype is nitpicked here, and while that particular device may have been used before many times over, it still feels as fresh as ever here with every scathing blow.  The chemistry between the characters also works well enough to the point where you actually care about them.But it's not the fact that the show is absolutely uproarious that sold me 100%.  The final nail in the coffin, so to speak, was the fact that the show has heart.  There are touching moments where friendship is displayed that gets you deep down inside.  While some are played for laughs, there are others that are sincerely emotional.  Maybe I'm just a big softy, but I enjoyed that part of the show the most.Being a senior in high school about to go to college, this show gave me a slight (albeit exagerated) idea of what college may or may not be like.  Thus, I am able to relate to the characters' experiences.  Sort of.  I can also relate to the social akwardness of the main character Nitz and him always trying to get the girl that is seemingly unreachable (oh, how many times that has happened to me...).  His three best friends are good supporting characters that make Nitz' presence seem worthwile.If you're in the mood for a light-hearted cartoon with a great sense of humor, well-timed one-liners, social satire, and a good nature and you can suspend your disbelief for a few hours, then by all means, you won't be able to do much better than Undergrads.",4,"Hilarious and at times, moving.",1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,1775,"['Yes', 'am', 'Undergrads', 'fan', 'full-fledged', 'fan', 'even', 'walk', 'talking', 'Cal', 'occasionally', 'know', 'sad', 'show', 'truly', 'unashamedly', 'funny', 'few', 'key', 'moments', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'see', 'episode', 'Risk', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'show', 'work', 'unflinching', 'satire', 'kind', 'school', 'stereotype', 'nitpicked', 'here', 'particular', 'device', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'before', 'many', 'times', 'still', 'as', 'fresh', 'ever', 'here', 'scathing', 'blow', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'also', 'well', 'enough', 'point', 'where', 'actually', 'care', 'them.But', 'not', 'fact', 'show', 'absolutely', 'uproarious', 'sold', '100', '%', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'so', 'speak', 'was', 'fact', 'show', 'heart', 'are', 'touching', 'moments', 'where', 'friendship', 'displayed', 'deep', 'down', 'inside', 'are', 'played', 'laughs', 'are', 'others', 'are', 'sincerely', 'emotional', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'big', 'softy', 'enjoyed', 'part', 'show', 'most.Being', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'go', 'college', 'show', 'gave', 'slight', 'exagerated', 'idea', 'what', 'college', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Thus', 'am', 'able', 'relate', 'characters', 'experiences', 'Sort', 'can', 'also', 'relate', 'social', 'akwardness', 'main', 'character', 'Nitz', 'always', 'trying', 'get', 'girl', 'seemingly', 'unreachable', 'oh', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'happened', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'good', 'supporting', 'characters', 'make', 'Nitz', 'presence', 'seem', ""'re"", 'mood', 'light-hearted', 'cartoon', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'well-timed', 'one-liners', 'social', 'satire', 'good', 'nature', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'few', 'hours', 'then', 'means', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'Undergrads']",Undergrads: Season 1

716583,A3RS0HI0DUS4GV,B00006IGVK,J. Schell,"[4, 11]","I rented the first disc of this and watched six episodes.  This show has a few funny bits but the majority of the jokes fall flat, primarily because of characters that only fulfil stereotypes without bringing anything unique to them.Gimpy is funny.  The other characters reuse jokes over and over again that were never funny in the first place, and are generally annoying.  Cal is unbelievably dumb, but that's pretty obvious from his dopy expression and hearing him display his stupidity with his every comment gets old quickly.  Also Cal's voice has to be the most annoying thing I've ever heard come out of my television.  The dumb frat character is also dumb, crude, and everything you'd expect from a dumb crude fratboy (except, oddly, that his fratbrothers detest him, which is one of the few surprising things in his storyline).  He has zero depth and no sympathetic qualities.  The only surprising thing about fratboy is that his high school friends tolerate his constant macho bs and stupidity and only get mildy annoyed.  As far as I remember, computer nerds and idiot jocks didn't really hang out together in high school.  They didn't normally have much in common to discuss.  It's surprising any of these characters are friends with each other besides the ""sort of"" main character, Nitz.  Nitz isn't funny either.  He's the stereotypical ""regular guy"" with no irregular characteristics besides that he's friends with such a diverse group of people.  He is pretty boring (perhaps a side-product of being completely ""regular""), and his obsession with an older girl who barely notices him would be boring to anyone who didn't go through a similar experience and ineptly flounder around in a similar way.  Heck, even to those of us who did, we know what's going to happen.  Hasn't this been done in enough 80's movies?There're very few funny occurances and the dialogue isn't great.  The show is completely predictable (that won't spoil the humor for some people) and desperately attempts to appeal to viewers who had similar friends in high school or college.

716585,A36OGGJQKZ4SGI,B00006IGVK,"matthewslaughter ""matthewslaughter""","[4, 4]","""Undergrads"" is one of the best television programs of the last ten years.  Of course it will inevitably draw comparisons to ""The Simpsons"" and ""The Critic"" because of its wide array of pop culture references, but the real reason ""Undergrads"" resonates is in the details.  Creator Pete Williams cleverly focuses on four characters who were best friends in high school and how this will affect their friendship once they enter college.  Each of the characters are very different, but Williams and the shows other writers do an excellent job of showing the dynamics that keep their friendships together.  The four characters are obviously types: Rocko is the lunkheaded frat-boy with the penchant for booze and porn; Gimpy is the shut-in computer nerd who always quotes ""Star Wars""; Cal is the vapid ladies' man ; and Nitz is the likable, shy, insecure and stubborn guy.  They are complemented by a stable of fantastic supporting characters: there is Jesse, the girl with the crush on Nitz; Kimmy, the girl Nitz has a crush on who is in every school club (a la Max in ""Rushmore""); Brody, the Hollywood dreamer/insider ; The Duggler, the RA who nobody likes ; Monk, Gimpy's faithful sidekick ; and Kruger, the foul-mouthed cynic.  Unlike ""The Simpsons,"" which is trapped in an eternal present, ""Undergrads"" actually advances in a linear fashion.  Details from the first episode ""Party"" show up in the penultimate episode ""Risk"" (in which they all play the board-game Risk), showing how all these details have been worked out by the creators, something that does not happen with this much skill in most animated comedy shows.  In ""Daria,"" for instance, characters and themes recur, but the sense of progressing time is always vague and slightly distorted.  Not only is the show tightly written, many of the characters' traits are firmly exploited for some great humor.  Gimpy's devotion to ""Star Wars"" necessitates an intense dislike of all things ""Star Trek"" related (notice how in the first episode Gimpy has a Captain Kirk blow-up punching doll?).  The also exploits the flashback, dream and desire devices to new ridiculous heights and depths, as well as the newspaper headline device to humorously sum-up less vital plot points (""RA Crumples Up Newspaper in Disgust,"" etc.).  People who have been to college, and especially those who lived in dorms will probably like this show more than others because it obviously exaggerates some aspects of college life.  But that is part of the show's charm.  The reason for the four-star review is that some of the earlier episodes are hampered by weak jokes and bad timing.  But as the first season progresses, the humor picks up with lightning speed and intelligence.  Highly recommended, and here's hoping for a second season ... just watch the final episode to see what I mean!",4,One of the best shows on television,1060300800,"08 8, 2003",2003,2821,"['Undergrads', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'programs', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'course', 'will', 'inevitably', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'Simpsons', 'Critic', 'wide', 'array', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'real', 'reason', 'Undergrads', 'details', 'Creator', 'Pete', 'Williams', 'cleverly', 'four', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'high', 'school', 'how', 'will', 'affect', 'friendship', 'enter', 'college', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'Williams', 'shows', 'other', 'writers', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'dynamics', 'keep', 'friendships', 'together', 'four', 'characters', 'are', 'obviously', 'types', 'Rocko', 'lunkheaded', 'frat-boy', 'penchant', 'booze', 'porn', 'Gimpy', 'shut-in', 'computer', 'nerd', 'who', 'always', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Cal', 'vapid', 'ladies', 'man', 'Nitz', 'likable', 'shy', 'insecure', 'stubborn', 'guy', 'are', 'complemented', 'stable', 'fantastic', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Jesse', 'girl', 'crush', 'Nitz', 'Kimmy', 'girl', 'Nitz', 'crush', 'who', 'school', 'club', 'la', 'Max', 'Rushmore', 'Brody', 'Hollywood', 'dreamer/insider', 'Duggler', 'RA', 'who', 'nobody', 'likes', 'Monk', 'Gimpy', 'faithful', 'sidekick', 'Kruger', 'foul-mouthed', 'cynic', 'Simpsons', 'trapped', 'eternal', 'present', 'Undergrads', 'actually', 'linear', 'fashion', 'Details', 'first', 'episode', 'Party', 'show', 'up', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'Risk', 'play', 'board-game', 'Risk', 'showing', 'how', 'details', 'have', 'been', 'worked', 'out', 'creators', 'something', 'not', 'happen', 'much', 'skill', 'most', 'animated', 'comedy', 'shows', 'Daria', 'instance', 'characters', 'themes', 'recur', 'sense', 'progressing', 'time', 'always', 'vague', 'slightly', 'distorted', 'Not', 'only', 'show', 'tightly', 'written', 'many', 'characters', 'traits', 'are', 'firmly', 'exploited', 'great', 'humor', 'Gimpy', 'devotion', 'Star', 'Wars', 'intense', 'dislike', 'things', 'Star', 'Trek', 'related', 'notice', 'how', 'first', 'episode', 'Gimpy', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'blow-up', 'punching', 'doll', 'also', 'flashback', 'dream', 'desire', 'devices', 'new', 'ridiculous', 'heights', 'depths', 'as', 'well', 'newspaper', 'headline', 'device', 'humorously', 'sum-up', 'less', 'vital', 'plot', 'points', 'RA', 'Crumples', 'Up', 'Newspaper', 'Disgust', 'etc.', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'college', 'especially', 'who', 'lived', 'dorms', 'will', 'probably', 'show', 'more', 'others', 'obviously', 'aspects', 'college', 'life', 'part', 'show', 'charm', 'reason', 'four-star', 'review', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'are', 'hampered', 'weak', 'jokes', 'bad', 'timing', 'first', 'season', 'progresses', 'humor', 'up', 'lightning', 'speed', 'intelligence', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'here', 'hoping', 'second', 'season', 'just', 'watch', 'final', 'episode', 'see', 'what', 'mean']",Undergrads: Season 1

The animation looks good, and the stories are well written.I did not see this cartoon on MTV, because let's face it, MTV is not really known for giving shows other then the cheaply made (So-called) reality based Television shows, a chance at doing well. So I did not want to get hooked on something, that was destine to be canceled.This DVD set can be found for under 20 dollars, so it is cheaper then most sets. You get 13 episodes, with some behind the scenes footage, commentary, character background info, ect. It is a pretty solid set. I have seen each episodes on TV and on DVD more times then I can count and I still have not gotten sick of watching them. (That's one of the staples of a good show, you never get sick of seeing it)It's up to you, but 20 dollars for 300 minutes of cartoon, seems like a good deal to me.",4,"Some people like it, some people don't.",1060905600,"08 15, 2003",2003,902,"['really', 'cartoon', 'opinion', 'cartoon', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'animation', 'good', 'stories', 'are', 'well', 'written.I', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'cartoon', 'MTV', 'let', 'face', 'MTV', 'not', 'really', 'known', 'giving', 'shows', 'other', 'then', 'cheaply', 'made', 'So-called', 'reality', 'based', 'Television', 'shows', 'chance', 'doing', 'well', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'get', 'hooked', 'something', 'was', 'destine', 'be', 'canceled.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'can', 'be', 'found', '20', 'dollars', 'cheaper', 'then', 'most', 'sets', 'get', '13', 'episodes', 'scenes', 'footage', 'commentary', 'character', 'background', 'info', 'ect', 'pretty', 'solid', 'set', 'have', 'seen', 'episodes', 'TV', 'DVD', 'more', 'times', 'then', 'can', 'count', 'still', 'have', 'not', 'gotten', 'sick', 'watching', 'one', 'staples', 'good', 'show', 'never', 'get', 'sick', 'seeing', 'up', '20', 'dollars', '300', 'minutes', 'cartoon', 'good', 'deal']",Undergrads: Season 1

I love all the characters and it's scary how the four guys all resemble four of my friends VERY closely.  Being in college myself I can say it is slightly exaggerated, but not extremely so.  I don't dorm but I wouldn't doubt that there are some crazy RAs in our dorms at NJCU.  If you are a fan of Undergrads please support the show by purchasing this season in hopes that it will send a message that Undergrads needs to continue.  If it worked for Family Guy (which I hear goes back on the air December of this year) then there's hope yet.
