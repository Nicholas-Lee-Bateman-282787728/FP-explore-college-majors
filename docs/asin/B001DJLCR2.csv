Anyone who has been married for a while can easily relate to many of the situations humorously portrayed in the show. The contrast between the veteran married couple and the newly married couple are thought-provoking, evoke a lot of memories and are a lot of fun. If you and your spouse are looking for something to make you step back, laugh, and appreciate what you have in your own relationship, this is a show you will enjoy.",5,one of the funniest shows ever,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,494,"['Death', 'one', 'favorite', 'television', 'comedies', 'time', 'Anyone', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'while', 'can', 'easily', 'relate', 'many', 'situations', 'humorously', 'portrayed', 'show', 'contrast', 'veteran', 'married', 'couple', 'newly', 'married', 'couple', 'are', 'thought-provoking', 'evoke', 'lot', 'memories', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'spouse', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'make', 'step', 'back', 'laugh', 'appreciate', 'what', 'have', 'own', 'relationship', 'show', 'will', 'enjoy']",'Til Death: Season 2

1181787,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B001DJLCR2,Enjolras,"[4, 5]","I was excited to see Brad Garrett of Raymond fame star in his own show. With Joely Fisher as his wife, Joy, and Step and Jeff Woodcock as his younger neighbors, the show becomes a running comedic commentary on marriage. The episodes contrast the two couples, old vs. young, cynical vs. naive, in a series of bizarre scenarios.Unfortunately, the show seemed to get a bit too comfortable and routine in the second season. Unlike his character Robert in ""Raymond,"" Garrett's character in ""Til Death"" gets a bit too cynical, and thus boring. Joy just gets on my nerves. The Woodcocks turn out to be the funniest characters, making it all the worse that season 2 was their last. While it's funny and certainly good for a few laughs, I never found myself really falling in love with the show or the characters.",3,"Funny, but getting a bit old",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,804,"['was', 'excited', 'see', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'Raymond', 'fame', 'star', 'own', 'show', 'Joely', 'Fisher', 'wife', 'Joy', 'Step', 'Jeff', 'Woodcock', 'younger', 'neighbors', 'show', 'running', 'comedic', 'commentary', 'marriage', 'episodes', 'contrast', 'two', 'couples', 'old', 'vs.', 'young', 'cynical', 'vs.', 'naive', 'series', 'bizarre', 'scenarios.Unfortunately', 'show', 'seemed', 'get', 'bit', 'too', 'comfortable', 'routine', 'second', 'season', 'character', 'Robert', 'Raymond', 'Garrett', 'character', 'Til', 'Death', 'bit', 'too', 'cynical', 'thus', 'boring', 'Joy', 'just', 'nerves', 'Woodcocks', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'funniest', 'characters', 'making', 'worse', 'season', '2', 'was', 'last', 'funny', 'certainly', 'good', 'few', 'laughs', 'never', 'found', 'really', 'falling', 'love', 'show', 'characters']",'Til Death: Season 2

I was sad to see this show go but I think it would have survived longer had it not been for the writer's strike. If you are expecting Everybody Loves Raymond, think again.  This is a different show but BG is still great, totally different character.  He and Jolie work very well together and they are believable as a couple.  If you are wanting a good comedy I would definitely recommend this to anyone of any age.  This show is about how an older couple (BG and JF) and how they compare to the newlywed couple that moved across the street.  The comedy is funny because it is based on real life scenarios, you can see them playing out in everyday life.
