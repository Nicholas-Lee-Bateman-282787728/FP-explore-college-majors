896072,A2UQJK29MKIPGM,B0007Z2556,Allen Bowers,"[1, 2]","I just saw this movie the other day thinking that it was going to be a remake of the The Boogeyman from 1980!! Well to my chagrin not only was it not a remake of that brilliant 80's classic but it also just didn't deliver the goods like it did either!! This movie was not horrible by any means,but it was very wanting in the scares and victims department. I mean what could they have possibly been thinking anybody would have found the least bit interesting about a horror movie where nothing much happens throughout the majority of it? To say nothing of the fact that there's neither any nudity nor much in the way of victims being killed by The so-called Boogeyman at all. So what do we have left then? Well let's see Barry Watson trying to deal with a childhood trauma while going from place to place with his homely and uninteresting not to mention pushy girlfriend. YAY!! LOL!! And the rest of the time he's either running into this really cute little girl named Franny or riding around with sexy ""Bones"" star Emily Deschanel. And the rest of the time he's alone walking around his old house AIMLESSLY!!! When his incredibly lame girlfriend gets seized by the Boogeyman for some reason we neither see her later on nor find out exactly what happened to her. For what it's worth I was seriously hoping for a sex/nude scene between Barry Watson and Emily Deschanel, but greatly to my chagrin it never happened. Needless to say with how dull the rest of the movie proved to be that just might have kept me from dozing off as I would've done had the movie been longer. Also for what it's worth the movie didn't need any of that corny zooming closely at the furniture and the doors and stuff. 'Cmon was that B.S. really necessary?! And when we finally come to his face-off against the Boogeyman, all we see is Barry and Emily being sucked towards the closet, only for him to need to just simply break a creepy doll and a plasma ball and then kick The Boogeyman in the head. And then all Barry does is look out the window. The only reason to even watch this borefest is just to see the impressive/precocious actress who played Franny!!

896073,A2FVE6V3YTFIDO,B0007Z2556,"Amazon Customer ""Glen""","[7, 8]","Despite the hype and critcism to the negative aspect, I liked this movie. The film industry in the past 30+ years has tried to feed us the fact that we cannot be scared without being force fed buckets of gore. Now in this generation, the public has become desensitized to the whole American horror movie genre. It has been played....and re-played....then replayed again so many times that it has become one genre that has totally lost it's originality. Aside from forays into the bizarre by Clive Barker and horror maven, Wes Craven, there has been little that hasn't been copied or overdone in the horror field. Sad, but true. Now movie execs are trying to aim movies at the voracious appetite of the younger crowd and are soft selling the horror movie to the PG-13 crowd and the ""R"" crowd are hating the lack of limbs (severed, that is) in these movies. If you go into this new found soft-core horror (so to speak) with lower expectations and an open mind, some of it can just be fun. That is what I liked about ""Boogeyman"". There is little here that cannot be viewed on late night TV without being hacked to death, no pun intended. Aside from the sometimes annoying amplified noises, there are no true horrifying scares, but if you get into the story there is a moral of a man confronting his childhood fears and triumphing and some genuine atmosheric chills. The hero, Tim, played effectively by 7th Heaven's Barry Watson is tramatised as a youth after seeing the much feared ""Boogeyman"" violently attack his father and pull him into the fabled closet, never to be seen again. At 23, having premonitions of his mother's death, prompts him to return to his childhood home and fears to confront and finally overcome the ""Boogeyman"". Although when the Boogeyman finally appears, the animatics are a bit weak, but I overlooked this because it was aimed at a younger crowd. Setting aside the obvious flaws, I found the underlying story of a man conquering his fears to be a nice escape from impaled and severed body parts and not a bad trip afterall. If you are looking for a thriller, this is a finely crafted, yet somewhat predictable story, capably acted by Watson. It's a fine, old fashioned type ghost story. If you are a gore hound, this is not for you.",4,Good Old fashioned GHOST story,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,2258,"['hype', 'critcism', 'negative', 'aspect', 'liked', 'movie', 'film', 'industry', 'past', '30+', 'years', 'tried', 'feed', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'scared', 'being', 'force', 'fed', 'buckets', 'gore', 'Now', 'generation', 'public', 'become', 'desensitized', 'whole', 'American', 'horror', 'movie', 'genre', 'been', 'played', '.and', 're-played', '.then', 'replayed', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'become', 'one', 'genre', 'totally', 'lost', 'originality', 'Aside', 'forays', 'bizarre', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'horror', 'maven', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'been', 'little', ""n't"", 'been', 'copied', 'overdone', 'horror', 'field', 'Sad', 'true', 'Now', 'movie', 'execs', 'are', 'trying', 'aim', 'movies', 'voracious', 'appetite', 'younger', 'crowd', 'are', 'soft', 'selling', 'horror', 'movie', 'PG-13', 'crowd', 'R', 'crowd', 'are', 'hating', 'lack', 'limbs', 'severed', 'movies', 'go', 'new', 'found', 'soft-core', 'horror', 'so', 'speak', 'lower', 'expectations', 'open', 'mind', 'can', 'just', 'be', 'fun', 'what', 'liked', 'Boogeyman', 'little', 'here', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'viewed', 'late', 'night', 'TV', 'being', 'hacked', 'death', 'pun', 'intended', 'Aside', 'sometimes', 'annoying', 'amplified', 'noises', 'are', 'true', 'horrifying', 'scares', 'get', 'story', 'moral', 'man', 'confronting', 'childhood', 'fears', 'triumphing', 'genuine', 'atmosheric', 'chills', 'hero', 'Tim', 'played', 'effectively', '7th', 'Heaven', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'tramatised', 'youth', 'seeing', 'much', 'feared', 'Boogeyman', 'violently', 'attack', 'father', 'pull', 'fabled', 'closet', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', '23', 'having', 'premonitions', 'mother', 'death', 'return', 'childhood', 'home', 'fears', 'confront', 'finally', 'overcome', 'Boogeyman', 'when', 'Boogeyman', 'finally', 'animatics', 'are', 'bit', 'weak', 'overlooked', 'was', 'aimed', 'younger', 'crowd', 'Setting', 'aside', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'found', 'underlying', 'story', 'man', 'conquering', 'fears', 'be', 'nice', 'escape', 'impaled', 'severed', 'body', 'parts', 'not', 'bad', 'trip', 'afterall', 'are', 'looking', 'thriller', 'finely', 'crafted', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'story', 'capably', 'acted', 'Watson', 'fine', 'old', 'fashioned', 'type', 'ghost', 'story', 'are', 'gore', 'hound', 'not']",Boogeyman

After all, the past couple year of horror movies have been somewhat bland and just not 'scary'.The movie's opening sequence grabs you right away and plays on childhood fears... once this movie grabs you it doesn't let go for quite some time.The shock value is high here... the director hides his wand rather well and doesn't 'scare' you until he is ready... then he throws the fright in your face. I admit there were several times I jumped... heck one time I even had goosebumps!The ending was a little disappointing to me as it seemed to be a 'cookie-cutter' ending, but no one is perfect.If you are looking for a horror movie with lots of gore this is not the movie for you.

896076,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0007Z2556,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 0]","Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and their Ghost House Pictures seems like it would of been a formidable new presence in the world of horror cinema. So far, it's pretty mediocre. ""The Grudge"" was decentley creepy and entertaining, but if they want to step up to the big leagues and deliver the kind of pictures they said they wanted to make, then they are going to have to keep trying, because this latest one is a step backwards. There are some inklings here and there that this film could of actually of been something. But for me, it seems to close to that incredibly bad and nauseating ""Darkness Falls"" debacle a while back. Both shot in New Zealand with a WB star and a childhood trauma. 7th Heaven's Barry Watson stars as Tim Jenkins, a young man who seems to be having good stuff going for him. A job, and a lovely girlfriend from a wealthy family. But Tim has a dark secret. 15 years earlier, as a young boy, he was scared to death by a story his father told him about the Boogeyman, only to see his father taken away by the thing. 15 years later, Tim is a shattered man frightened by closets, and trying to live down that moment. Pushed by a psyciatrist, Tim returns to the old family home after his mother's death to finally confront his issues and to see if he is really crazy, or if the creature that has hauunted many a kids' closet is real. Helping him along the way is old childhood friend Kate(Emily Deschannel). I won't deny the fact that the movie does have a number of interesting scenes and some genuine chills and spooks, but there are not that many and they are few and far between. Most of the time it's just hot air with ""did something just happen?"" or ""did I just see something"". The movie's running time is pretty short, but it felt much longer. The movie plods along with a lot of time devoted to seeing different parts of the spooky house, and seeing Watson walk along hallways, up stairs, and in rooms investigating. The last half of the film does liven things up a bit, but it doesn't make up for the tedium leading up to it. Watson does a decent enough job playing the hauntedness of the Tim character, with this burden on his back. Others fare less well. Not because Deschannell is bad, but because it's the same old character we've seen a hundred million times. ""Xena"" star Lucy Lawless also pops in as Tim's mother. Director Stephen Kay does have some interesting direction and there are a number of shots that are visually effective. Too bad they weren't in a better movie.  All in all, the idea was good and could of been used to full blown terror and horror. Even tho there are some creepy moments, it plays it safe in it's PG-13 way and ends up being vanilla when it could of been blood red.",2,Count To Five....,1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,2719,"['Sam', 'Raimi', 'Rob', 'Tapert', 'Ghost', 'House', 'Pictures', 'would', 'been', 'formidable', 'new', 'presence', 'world', 'horror', 'cinema', 'So', 'far', 'pretty', 'mediocre', 'Grudge', 'was', 'decentley', 'creepy', 'entertaining', 'want', 'step', 'up', 'big', 'leagues', 'deliver', 'kind', 'pictures', 'said', 'wanted', 'make', 'then', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'keep', 'trying', 'latest', 'one', 'step', 'backwards', 'are', 'inklings', 'here', 'there', 'film', 'could', 'actually', 'been', 'something', 'close', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'nauseating', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'debacle', 'while', 'back', 'shot', 'New', 'Zealand', 'WB', 'star', 'childhood', 'trauma', '7th', 'Heaven', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'Tim', 'Jenkins', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'stuff', 'going', 'job', 'lovely', 'girlfriend', 'wealthy', 'family', 'Tim', 'dark', 'secret', '15', 'years', 'earlier', 'young', 'boy', 'was', 'scared', 'death', 'story', 'father', 'told', 'Boogeyman', 'only', 'see', 'father', 'taken', 'away', 'thing', '15', 'years', 'later', 'Tim', 'shattered', 'man', 'frightened', 'closets', 'trying', 'live', 'down', 'moment', 'Pushed', 'psyciatrist', 'Tim', 'old', 'family', 'home', 'mother', 'death', 'finally', 'confront', 'issues', 'see', 'really', 'crazy', 'creature', 'hauunted', 'many', 'kids', 'closet', 'real', 'Helping', 'way', 'old', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Kate', 'Emily', 'Deschannel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'fact', 'movie', 'have', 'number', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'genuine', 'chills', 'spooks', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Most', 'time', 'just', 'hot', 'air', 'did', 'something', 'just', 'happen', 'did', 'just', 'see', 'something', 'movie', 'running', 'time', 'pretty', 'short', 'felt', 'much', 'longer', 'movie', 'plods', 'lot', 'time', 'devoted', 'seeing', 'different', 'parts', 'spooky', 'house', 'seeing', 'Watson', 'walk', 'hallways', 'up', 'stairs', 'rooms', 'investigating', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'liven', 'things', 'up', 'bit', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'tedium', 'leading', 'up', 'Watson', 'decent', 'enough', 'job', 'playing', 'hauntedness', 'Tim', 'character', 'burden', 'back', 'Others', 'fare', 'less', 'well', 'Not', 'Deschannell', 'bad', 'same', 'old', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'million', 'times', 'Xena', 'star', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'also', 'Tim', 'mother', 'Director', 'Stephen', 'Kay', 'have', 'interesting', 'direction', 'are', 'number', 'shots', 'are', 'visually', 'effective', 'Too', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'better', 'movie', 'idea', 'was', 'good', 'could', 'been', 'used', 'full', 'blown', 'terror', 'horror', 'Even', 'are', 'creepy', 'moments', 'safe', 'PG-13', 'way', 'up', 'being', 'vanilla', 'when', 'could', 'been', 'blood', 'red']",Boogeyman
896077,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0007Z2556,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","I'm a little ticked off right now- this movie is flat out *awful*.  83 minutes of complete boredom.  I want my time back!The movie relies on several cheap jump scares, but these segments are executed in the most unimaginative way ever.  The music and sound effects just suddenly turn LOUD without there actually being anything scary occurring on screen.  It's an incredibly easy trick to try and scare viewers by having them first experience several seconds of complete silence, then a loud noise to trigger a frightened reaction.  A terrible trick to try and make a movie scary if there ever was one.  Didn't fool me, thankfully.I can only recall two scenes that truly frightened me. One is when the main character of Barry Watson stumbles into a room where a little girl is sleeping and she's so frantic Barry can't calm her down.  Meanwhile the girl is looking at the ceiling the whole time she's freaking out.  Barry turns around and sees someone has been in the room as evident by the one out of place ceiling tile.The other quality segment is near the end when FINALLY the boogeyman makes his first appearance, and a man with a nail gun appears and shoots at what Barry initially thinks is him, but then Barry turns around and sees the boogeyman charging out of the darkness behind him, which is who the nail gun shooter is aiming for.  A rare moment of actual suspense.Barry Watson is a pretty good actor, but he was given a terrible script to work with.  The entire pacing and storyline feels similar to watching an episode of Ghost Whisperer or Beverly Hills 90210.  You know, not *real* suspense- more like suspense intended for the easily frightened types.  That's what this movie is.  It's horrendous.Also, the appeal of the boogeyman is supposed to be centered around children being afraid to fall asleep for fear the boogeyman's hiding in the closet but... this movie abandons that all-important aspect and instead focuses on Barry Watson's character walking around through dark homes and playgrounds meeting a little girl on two occasions, and a girl he likes (Emily Deschanel's character, who's also out of place- stick with Bones, Emily).No fear, lots of boredom, a complete waste of my time, and I'm angry.",1,worst boogeyman ever,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,2224,"[""'m"", 'little', 'ticked', 'off', 'right', 'now-', 'movie', 'flat', '*awful*', '83', 'minutes', 'complete', 'boredom', 'want', 'time', 'back', 'movie', 'several', 'cheap', 'jump', 'scares', 'segments', 'are', 'executed', 'most', 'unimaginative', 'way', 'ever', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'just', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'LOUD', 'actually', 'being', 'anything', 'scary', 'occurring', 'screen', 'incredibly', 'easy', 'trick', 'try', 'scare', 'viewers', 'having', 'first', 'experience', 'several', 'seconds', 'complete', 'silence', 'then', 'loud', 'noise', 'trigger', 'frightened', 'reaction', 'terrible', 'trick', 'try', 'make', 'movie', 'scary', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Did', ""n't"", 'fool', 'thankfully.I', 'can', 'only', 'recall', 'two', 'scenes', 'truly', 'frightened', 'One', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'room', 'where', 'little', 'girl', 'sleeping', 'so', 'frantic', 'Barry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'calm', 'down', 'Meanwhile', 'girl', 'looking', 'ceiling', 'whole', 'time', 'freaking', 'out', 'Barry', 'around', 'someone', 'been', 'room', 'evident', 'one', 'out', 'place', 'ceiling', 'tile.The', 'other', 'quality', 'segment', 'end', 'when', 'FINALLY', 'boogeyman', 'first', 'appearance', 'man', 'nail', 'gun', 'shoots', 'what', 'Barry', 'initially', 'then', 'Barry', 'around', 'boogeyman', 'charging', 'darkness', 'who', 'nail', 'gun', 'shooter', 'aiming', 'rare', 'moment', 'actual', 'suspense.Barry', 'Watson', 'pretty', 'good', 'actor', 'was', 'given', 'terrible', 'script', 'work', 'entire', 'pacing', 'storyline', 'feels', 'similar', 'watching', 'episode', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'know', 'not', '*real*', 'suspense-', 'more', 'suspense', 'intended', 'easily', 'frightened', 'types', 'what', 'movie', 'horrendous.Also', 'appeal', 'boogeyman', 'supposed', 'be', 'centered', 'children', 'being', 'afraid', 'fall', 'asleep', 'fear', 'boogeyman', 'hiding', 'closet', 'movie', 'all-important', 'aspect', 'instead', 'focuses', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'character', 'walking', 'dark', 'homes', 'playgrounds', 'meeting', 'little', 'girl', 'two', 'occasions', 'girl', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'character', 'who', 'also', 'place-', 'stick', 'Bones', 'Emily', '.No', 'fear', 'lots', 'boredom', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', ""'m"", 'angry']",Boogeyman

896089,A3ADA4TND5VOY6,B0007Z2556,"Charles G. Fry ""cgfry""","[5, 5]","Boogeyman oozes with fear, primarily because Barry Watson is fantastic at showing the panicky, childish fear we all know is deep within ourselves.  This fear is the centerpiece of Boogeyman; this is not a slasher or gorefest movie.  The Ring, Darkness Falls, and Jeepers Creepers are other recent Hollywood releases that are scary in similar ways.  The cinematography, editing, and overall direction by Stephen Kay are first-rate.  There really is no sound track, but rather a nearly continuous series of creepy sound-effects that increasingly prickle the nerves (in a good/creepy way) as the movie runs.  The combination make watching Boogeyman a genuinely scary experience.One wonders through most of the movie whether this really is about a supernatural, literal Boogeyman, or perhaps a digression into the mind of sick young man who was psychologically deranged by his father's locking him in closets as a youngster and then running off, leaving a seriously depressed wife and emotionally damaged son.  Some aspects of the movie brought to mind Identity, and Hide and Seek.  Without giving anything away, suffice it to say that the resolution to Boogeyman's story does not satisfy either as a monster movie or as a psychological thriller.It is surprising that this movie doesn't rate higher, as all but the final 10 minutes are quite good.  Unfortunately, the ending is often what's remembered, and perhaps that's part of the reason for the low ratings.  Expectations from Raimi's involvement (which apparently was very slight) and Evil Dead are sure to disappoint; Boogeyman is a completely different type of movie.  Even so, Boogeyman is very scary throughout (unless blood-n-guts are required to scare you), and is overall a very good movie.The Special Edition DVD has an alternate ending that is quite good (perhaps superior), being very different from that in the movie.  I usually skip watching the deleted scenes, but am glad I watched them here; many are great, e.g., Watson once again excelling in his portrayal of a visceral revulsion to a maggot-ridden rabbit falling on him.  Two ""Making of"" features are also well done, and compensate for the lack of a commentary track for the movie.Recommended",4,Genuinely Creepy,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,2212,"['Boogeyman', 'fear', 'primarily', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'fantastic', 'showing', 'panicky', 'childish', 'fear', 'know', 'deep', 'fear', 'centerpiece', 'Boogeyman', 'not', 'slasher', 'gorefest', 'movie', 'Ring', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'are', 'other', 'recent', 'Hollywood', 'releases', 'are', 'scary', 'similar', 'ways', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'overall', 'direction', 'Stephen', 'Kay', 'are', 'first-rate', 'really', 'sound', 'track', 'rather', 'nearly', 'continuous', 'series', 'creepy', 'sound-effects', 'increasingly', 'prickle', 'nerves', 'good/creepy', 'way', 'movie', 'combination', 'make', 'watching', 'Boogeyman', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'experience.One', 'wonders', 'most', 'movie', 'really', 'supernatural', 'literal', 'Boogeyman', 'perhaps', 'digression', 'mind', 'sick', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'psychologically', 'deranged', 'father', 'locking', 'closets', 'youngster', 'then', 'running', 'off', 'leaving', 'seriously', 'depressed', 'wife', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'son', 'aspects', 'movie', 'brought', 'mind', 'Identity', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'suffice', 'say', 'resolution', 'Boogeyman', 'story', 'not', 'satisfy', 'either', 'monster', 'movie', 'psychological', 'thriller.It', 'surprising', 'movie', ""n't"", 'rate', 'higher', 'final', '10', 'minutes', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Unfortunately', 'ending', 'often', 'what', 'remembered', 'perhaps', 'part', 'reason', 'low', 'ratings', 'Expectations', 'Raimi', 'involvement', 'apparently', 'was', 'very', 'slight', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'are', 'sure', 'disappoint', 'Boogeyman', 'completely', 'different', 'type', 'movie', 'Even', 'so', 'Boogeyman', 'very', 'scary', 'blood-n-guts', 'are', 'required', 'scare', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie.The', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'alternate', 'ending', 'quite', 'good', 'perhaps', 'superior', 'being', 'very', 'different', 'movie', 'usually', 'skip', 'watching', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'am', 'glad', 'watched', 'here', 'many', 'are', 'great', 'e.g.', 'Watson', 'once', 'again', 'excelling', 'portrayal', 'visceral', 'revulsion', 'maggot-ridden', 'rabbit', 'falling', 'Two', 'Making', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'compensate', 'lack', 'commentary', 'track', 'movie.Recommended']",Boogeyman

It usually sounds like a cello being sliced in two by a guillotine and it's a sure sign that a movie doesn't have any honest scares.You know the drill:The hero cautiously backs into a dark room and bumps into - SHREEENK! - a coat rack.The heroine closes a medicine cabinet and in the mirror - SHREEENK! - sees the ghost of her great-aunt.Few recent horror flicks have relied as heavily on the ""SHREEENK!"" as ""Boogeyman,"" which is often atmospheric but mostly silly and boring.Following a childhood run-in with the title character, magazine editor Tim (Barry Watson) is left with a crippling fear of closets and other dark storage spaces. He's a mess. At 23, he still stops in for treatment at the kid's ward of his neighborhood psychiatric hospital.""Look around you,"" his doctor finally tells him. ""There are only children here.""I fear that scene isn't nearly as moving as the writers intended, but it sets the tone because Tim spends most of the movie walking around his dark old house wigging out - in fact, a good 60 percent of the film's running time is devoted to scenes in which he approaches sinister-looking doors/staircases/barns really... really... really... slowly (just before the ""SHREEENK!"").The rest of the movie involves Tim doubting his sanity and awkwardly courting his childhood sweetheart (Emily Deschanel, who isn't given much to do but still manages to be the best thing in the movie). Eventually, they battle the fabled Boogie Man, and I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure their conflict ends as the result of a complete lack of ideas.This is one ""Boogeyman"" that won't keep many viewers awake.

People either walked away stunned or they couldn't even watch the rest(like my mom). If you notice there really isn't any ""BOO!"" scenes in them save for maybe 2 really tame ones. But it was the atmosphere and the tone that freaks people out. Lately, it just seems movies want to have ""BOO!""s every 10 minutes and pass it off as a scary movie. Hence, we have Boogeyman.Tim ever since he was young, believes his father was taken by the Boogeyman. 15 years later and he's still freaked about closets. He goes to his girlfriend's house to meet the folks but gets an odd premonition about his mother's death(which is odd, what's that gotta do with the Boogeyman?). After his funeral he decides to stay in his old house which is uncle is fixing up.And as usual, things go bump in the night, meets a mysterious girl named Franny who has had someone taken. Tim's old friend Kate comes over and she gets weirded out too about his behaviour. Tim has to step out and face him if he's ever to purge him from his life.There's 2 overused ""boo"" moments in films: the cat/guy behind a door when we thought it was the ghost/alien/monster and someone walking/running past the camera. In Sixth Sense, it was a woman in a housecoat and it's here too. Then there's the quick flash of images/flashback meant to disorient you but really you end up feeling nothing. It's just a bunch of stuff flashing really quickly.Performance-wise it's surprising good. Barry Watson is a nice leading man and his old friend is good(not awesome though) by Emily Deschanel. The effects(something that needs to stop too, enough with the CG in horror movies, guys) are passable but not outstanding.If you have a girl and want her to clench your arm really hard, get it.

896100,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0007Z2556,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","When are Hollywood writers and directors going to learn?  Once you show us the ""monster,"" it's no longer scary.  I don't understand this obsession with CGI and special effects; this movie isn't original by any means, but it works reasonably well - until the special effects guys take over toward the end.  Besides showing us what the Boogeyman looks like, they also give us a climax that is much ado about nothing.  Apparently, they believed that they could cover up the flatline of an ending by making us dizzy and distracting us with the power of giant fans off-screen.  It's disappointing because Boogeyman could have been a pretty good scary movie.There is a reason that this kind of thing-in-the-closet movie with all of the standard horror clich&eacute;s keeps being made - quite simply, it works to some degree.  At some point in our childhoods, we all were scared of the dark and the monster in the closet (or under the bed), and my own feeling is that we adults are also - deep down inside - still a little afraid of the proverbial Boogeyman.  Silly it may be, but I wouldn't go to sleep with a closet door left open for all the tea in China.  The basic premise works because we can all identify with it.  Boogeyman starts out following the traditional path - the child in bed intro, the spooky closet door phobia, the creepy old house where everything squeaks, and the movement of nasty little somethings just outside our field of vision.  Then the filmmakers expanded things out a little and added another perspective - that's okay, even though I and probably most viewers saw right through it from the very beginning.  Then they just blew it.Not only did the filmmakers put a face on the Boogeyman, they decided to make the latter stages of Boogeyman really weird, completely pulling the rug of believability out from under the entire audience.  As long as Tim (Barry Watson) is continually dealing with his fear of dark closets and all the other creepy aspects of his childhood home, you're pretty much right there with him.  Then the movie sort of slaps you in the face and tells you it's just a movie by introducing impossible twists and then bringing the Boogeyman out of the closet.  This causes an immediate disconnect with the audience, and so it is that the final big scenes are more laughable than frightening - and, since we're not completely wrapped up in the big special effects ending, we have time to think about a few weaknesses that turned up earlier in the story.Although I thought the movie was rather effective up to a point toward the end, I have to round my 3.5 stars down to three.  Boogeyman does have some spooky elements to it, but it doesn't answer all the questions it raises, its twists are a little too easy to see through, and the big ending leaves you feeling limp rather than excited - and, like several others, I had a few Darkness Falls d&eacute;j&agrave; vu moments while I was watching the movie.  If they had just left the Boogeyman in the closet where he belongs, this might have been a four star effort.On a final note, I would just alert viewers to the presence of a tiny bonus scene at the end, following the final credits - it's not much to sneeze at, but it's there.",3,"Forgets the first rule of horror: never put a face on the ""monster""",1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,3221,"['When', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'writers', 'directors', 'going', 'learn', 'show', 'monster', 'longer', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'obsession', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', ""n't"", 'original', 'means', 'reasonably', 'well', 'special', 'effects', 'guys', 'take', 'over', 'end', 'showing', 'what', 'Boogeyman', 'also', 'give', 'climax', 'much', 'ado', 'nothing', 'Apparently', 'believed', 'could', 'cover', 'up', 'flatline', 'ending', 'making', 'dizzy', 'distracting', 'power', 'giant', 'fans', 'off-screen', 'disappointing', 'Boogeyman', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'scary', 'reason', 'kind', 'thing-in-the-closet', 'movie', 'standard', 'horror', 'clich', 'eacute', 'being', 'made', 'quite', 'simply', 'degree', 'point', 'childhoods', 'were', 'scared', 'dark', 'monster', 'closet', 'bed', 'own', 'feeling', 'adults', 'are', 'also', 'deep', 'inside', 'still', 'little', 'afraid', 'proverbial', 'Boogeyman', 'Silly', 'may', 'be', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'sleep', 'closet', 'door', 'left', 'open', 'tea', 'China', 'basic', 'premise', 'works', 'can', 'identify', 'Boogeyman', 'out', 'following', 'traditional', 'path', 'child', 'bed', 'intro', 'spooky', 'closet', 'door', 'phobia', 'creepy', 'old', 'house', 'where', 'everything', 'squeaks', 'movement', 'nasty', 'little', 'somethings', 'just', 'field', 'vision', 'Then', 'filmmakers', 'expanded', 'things', 'out', 'little', 'added', 'perspective', 'okay', 'even', 'probably', 'most', 'viewers', 'saw', 'right', 'very', 'beginning', 'Then', 'just', 'blew', 'it.Not', 'only', 'did', 'filmmakers', 'put', 'face', 'Boogeyman', 'decided', 'make', 'latter', 'stages', 'Boogeyman', 'really', 'weird', 'completely', 'pulling', 'rug', 'believability', 'entire', 'audience', 'As', 'long', 'Tim', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'continually', 'dealing', 'fear', 'dark', 'closets', 'other', 'creepy', 'aspects', 'childhood', 'home', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'right', 'there', 'Then', 'movie', 'sort', 'slaps', 'face', 'just', 'movie', 'introducing', 'impossible', 'twists', 'then', 'bringing', 'Boogeyman', 'closet', 'immediate', 'disconnect', 'audience', 'final', 'big', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'laughable', 'frightening', ""'re"", 'not', 'completely', 'wrapped', 'up', 'big', 'special', 'effects', 'ending', 'have', 'time', 'think', 'few', 'weaknesses', 'turned', 'up', 'earlier', 'story.Although', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'effective', 'up', 'point', 'end', 'have', 'round', '3.5', 'stars', 'down', 'three', 'Boogeyman', 'have', 'spooky', 'elements', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'twists', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'see', 'big', 'ending', 'leaves', 'feeling', 'limp', 'rather', 'excited', 'several', 'others', 'had', 'few', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'moments', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'had', 'just', 'left', 'Boogeyman', 'closet', 'where', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'four', 'star', 'final', 'note', 'would', 'just', 'alert', 'viewers', 'presence', 'tiny', 'bonus', 'scene', 'end', 'following', 'final', 'credits', 'not', 'much', 'sneeze', 'there']",Boogeyman

I've seen high ratings on some worthless movies.  Thankfully, general consensus seems to agree with my humble opinion that this movie was all about using the known legend of the boogeyman to get people's attention, don't bother writing a script or developing a plot, don't feel the need to explain any of what's happening....just throw a couple of 'pretty' college age kids on the screen, add some reasonable special effects in a couple of scenes, suddenly startle the audience a few times (such as when a guy's driving down a road with his mind wandering, suddenly have a bird fly into his windshield for no reason, just to startle the audience and make up for the fact that the flick has nowhere to go), occasionally lean on eerie lighting and shadows, etc.....and before you know it, you have a movie.  I figure this movie is worth 2 stars, because there are a few mildly entertaining scenes with decent special effects.  And, it is a good movie to put in the DVD player late at night if you're having trouble falling asleep, and you need something to put you to sleep.  But all in all, this movie is a very transparent attempt to make money using an established premise like the Boogeyman to get people's attention, and then hope that special effects and 'pretty' demographically-ideal-aged actors will make up for the lack of actually MAKING A MOVIE!  A final hint to the filmmakers:  If you wanted to make a flick that so transparently relies on nothing but fluff, nudity and sex are sure-fire ways of getting people to pay attention to you.

The opening sequence of the film is a tense experience which shows the  film's hero - Tim as a kid, experiencing the usual night terrors involving a closet and darkness. However, when his reassuring father is actually snatched by something in the closet in front of his eyes, the poor lad then develops a very understandable terror of closets which continues into adulthood.Years later Tim (well played by Barry Watson)returns to his family house, following the death of his mother, after having lived away for years,  and has to confront the monster that is responsible for taking his father years ago.Barry Watson makes Tim a sympathetic hero who has to cope with the terror of his past, and a circle of family and friends who believe that his father walked out, as opposed to what he saw on that night.The film is atmospheric and jumpy in places. Sadly though it is badly let down by a CGI monster which could have been far more effectively depicted by a live actor in make up.Hardly a horror masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, this film is at best average entertainment from the genre.

During the last couple of years, they have given us ""Darkness Falls"", ""They"", ""The Ring 2"", ""The Grudge"", ""Hide and Seek"" and poor remakes such as ""The Haunting"", ""House On Haunted Hill"", ""Amityville Horror"", ""House Of Wax"" (in-name only remake),""The Fog"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Not to mention the countless other horror attrocities that have gone directly to video/DVD.To be fair the ""Amityville"" remake was technically better than the original and the newer ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was a pretty good time-waster with some genuine thrills. Even some straight-to-video releases such as ""Dead Birds"" and ""Toolbox Murders"" had their moments but they were not on the same level as some of the earlier classics such as ""Black Christmas"", ""Halloween"", ""The Shining"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Poltergeist"", ""Suspiria"", ""The Changeling"", ""The Howling"", ""An American Werewolf In London""... you get my point? Judging by Hollywood's recent track record, I'm getting the impression that today's film-maker's really don't give a darn about the ""horror"" genre. Which is a shame because there are millions of horror film fans out there just waiting for that one horror masterpiece.The wait will continue because BOOGEYMAN isn't it. As a matter of fact, this film has got to be the worst horror film of the last 10 years.The film stars a very stiff Barry Watson (whom I believe has no facial muscles since his expression does not seem to change for the duration of this film) who plays a traumatized magazine editor who returns to his childhood home to confront his childhood fear- the CGI created title character. Sounds interesting? It really isn't. Maybe with a different cast, different script and a different director, this may have been worth the while but everything about this film is ""bottom-of-the-barrell"". The entire adult cast including Lucy Lawless is stiff and uninspired. The child protaganist Skye McCole Bartusiak doesn't fare any better. I never thought the day would come that I'd utter these unfortunate words: ""Dakota Fanning- where are you?""As for the Boogeyman himself, once he's revealed to the viewer, he is as frightening as Gonzo from ""The Muppet Show"". But wait, even the muppets have more depth, more character than this flat, dreary, one-dimensional entity created using someone's laptop.There is an obscure, low-budget, early 80's horror film called ""The Boogeyman"" starring the life-less (I am sensing a trend here) Suzanne Love and the always creepy John Carradine. Although it is no masterpiece and the film suffers greatly from it's obvious low-budget and bad acting, it is still a lot more entertaining and creative than this stinker. ""Boogeyman""(2005) has nothing to recommend it. There's not one memorable scene or character.

It is made by the same people who made ''The Grudge'' and ''Army Of Darkness''.The film is about a man named Tim. It starts off with Tim as a kid seeing his father get killed by the Boogeyman in his bedroom closet. It then cuts to Tim as an adult with his girlfriend Jessica. Tim is now terrified of closets because of what he saw when he was young. During the course of the movie, Tim has scary visions, including one of his mother. Tim later meets up with his childhood friend Kate, and he also meets a mysterious young girl named Franny. Throughout the film, the viewer is trying to find out whether Tim is delusional, or whether he is really being haunted by the Boogeyman.

For example, in the beginning of the show, the kid's father is hurled up and down the parameters of the closet space with such force and animation similar to the old cartoons.  It is more comical than terrifying.  And the ghoul, whose motives are left unstated, seems merely to be a mischievious character reminiscent of bugs bunny or daffy duck, or, better yet, woody the wood pecker of Mel Blanc lore.  Except, instead of the humor resuting from that head banging lunacy of Melanerpes formicivorus, we have the same mischief combined with unadulterated malcontent.  The acting seems to involve lots of young people with pensive faces trying to imitate how young people talk and act.  The theater does have as its goal the imitation of real life, but not verbatim.  Improvization and poetic liberty seem to be a foreign concept to many of these young actors.  The plot?  There wasn't any.  No punch line.  The producers apparently thought that putting a kid in a haunted house of his youth, embellishing the spook with special effects, and adding a minor subplot of his social life would make for great movie making.  It fails miserably.  Why this immaterial being is able to bring about physical effects, and why, in the end, he is finally subject to being hit over the head with a common table lamp, begs the question.",1,Looney toon or boogeyman?,1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,1460,"['Did', 'retired', 'cartoonists', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'Looney', 'Toons', 'have', 'hand', 'making', 'film', 'certainly', 'salient', 'feature', 'example', 'beginning', 'show', 'kid', 'father', 'hurled', 'up', 'parameters', 'closet', 'space', 'such', 'force', 'animation', 'similar', 'old', 'cartoons', 'more', 'comical', 'terrifying', 'ghoul', 'motives', 'are', 'left', 'unstated', 'merely', 'be', 'mischievious', 'character', 'reminiscent', 'bugs', 'bunny', 'daffy', 'duck', 'better', 'yet', 'woody', 'wood', 'pecker', 'Mel', 'Blanc', 'lore', 'instead', 'humor', 'resuting', 'head', 'banging', 'lunacy', 'Melanerpes', 'formicivorus', 'have', 'same', 'mischief', 'combined', 'unadulterated', 'malcontent', 'acting', 'involve', 'lots', 'young', 'people', 'pensive', 'trying', 'imitate', 'how', 'young', 'people', 'talk', 'act', 'theater', 'have', 'goal', 'imitation', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'verbatim', 'Improvization', 'poetic', 'liberty', 'seem', 'be', 'foreign', 'concept', 'many', 'young', 'actors', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'punch', 'line', 'producers', 'apparently', 'thought', 'putting', 'kid', 'haunted', 'house', 'youth', 'embellishing', 'spook', 'special', 'effects', 'adding', 'minor', 'subplot', 'social', 'life', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'making', 'miserably', 'Why', 'immaterial', 'being', 'able', 'bring', 'about', 'physical', 'effects', 'why', 'end', 'finally', 'subject', 'being', 'hit', 'head', 'common', 'table', 'lamp', 'question']",Boogeyman

I commend him for having the bearing to deal with the chemo treatments, etc and being able to work (acting is actually tough work, folks).However, it is sad that this is the film that he made.Boogeyman is a sad little film that actually has the potential to scare, but then pulls away from it to give you exactly what is expected rather than delivering chills.It was not too unlike several other ""horror"" films and yet a very poor immitation of any of them.The title character looks not unlike a Freddy Kreuger action figure (I guess that's what it's supposed to be) that young Tim has on his nightstand.There's so much rigamarole that you don't know what or why things are happening and not for good reasons. The filmmakers have borrowed heavily from Butterfly Effect, Poltergeist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the Sixth Sense. Unfortunately, the effect is less than desireable.After watching a couple of interesting turns whither, the ending is nothing short of disappointing. There's no real resolution. Even the soundtrack sounds unconvinced that the action on screen could reveal the actual conclusion.It is doubtful that Barry Watson will win any acting awards, but he is not bad - he's just not really good either.

This kid grows up and has trouble coping and dealing with the world. Well, I guess I would be too if the Boogeyman killed my dad. But our hero, Tim, has trouble convincing the rest of the world that the Boogeyman killed his dad. They're all convinced that he's just constructed the whole thing to help him deal with the fact that his dad walked out on him and his mom. Losing his dad has turned Tim into a pretty morose adult. His girlfriend is getting more than a little sick of his antics.So when Mom dies, Tim returns home to confront his inner demons. The whole time we are supposed to be wondering if there really is a Boogeyman or if Tim really has gone off the deep end. Most of the movie is spent with that ambiguity in place, which means that not a lot really happens. Tim spends a lot of time exploring his house, having the obligatory flashbacks to his troubled youth, when his father would lock him in the closet to try and get him over his fear of the Boogeyman. He sees scary stuff, then turns around and the scary stuff isn't there anymore. He laughs nervously to himself. That sucks up about 70 minutes of screen time.Tim meets a little girl named Franny, who's been following him around and watching him carefully. Franny tells Tim that her dad tried to kill the Boogeyman, but he wasn't strong enough to face it. She really doesn't serve any other purpose in the movie, other than to be the sage ghost (yes, she turns out to be a ghost) who tells our hero how to defeat the bad guy. When Tim finally beats the Boogeyman in the end of the movie, it's by a means that is so ridiculous, that you really can't help but feel completely let down. This is a Boogeyman that has none of the style or panache of his predecessors: Freddy, Jason, Michael, Pinhead or even Chucky.In the end, I felt a little like how I felt after watching THE LAST HORROR MOVIE.

That being said, this movie actually managed to beat the incredibly low expectations I had for it.  Not that this ended up being a really great film, it just wasn't as terrible as I thought it would be.  I wouldn't even remotely class this as a horror film after seeing it; it's more like a suspense or thriller film from my point of view.  The story line is hardly original, as I'm sure anyone could guess by the title, but it was a fairly interesting take on the old childhood tale.Basically the premise of the film is that as a child Barry Watson's character, Tim, witnessed his father being taken by the Boogeyman.  Naturally no one believed his story and said he manifested the idea because his father really ran off.  However, he spends the rest of his life being frightened of closets and so forth.  So, when the other reviewers say the first portion of the film spends a good deal of time staring at slightly ajar closets, they're right.  Personally, these parts are hilarious and give your friends and you time to laugh at the sequence and its general absurdity.  The fact that Barry Watson is actually a good actor really made this movie fairly decent.  His blonde girlfriend on the other hand was just annoying.  Anyway, the Boogeyman never stops pestering Tim and those around him and really adds to the general concept that all the stories are real, which makes the movie suspenseful.  However, I have to say I really didn't find it scary and as another reviewer pointed out can easily be watched with some younger people (it is rated PG-13 after all), because there is very little violence or gore.This movie was fairly decent up until the end.  The end was pretty cheesy in my opinion.  I understand what they were doing and how the Boogeyman was created/made up, but it was still kind of silly (again, it's a children's story, I know).  I was hoping for more of an adult revelation towards the end though, like some sort of occult/ancient dark spirit concept that just flowed and would actually be more frightening.  We didn't get that in this film though, it almost went in that direction when Tim learned about a guy who tried to understand the entity, but they never really built up that more realistic fear factor.Naturally this type of movie isn't going to blow me away and it's certainly not something I'll be watching over and over again.  It's an overly simple and basic movie and it really doesn't hold a huge amount of merit in that, but up till the end I did enjoy the mystery and the adventure of trying to figure things out.  I thought that part was at least fairly well written.  If you really have nothing to do and this movie is playing on TV then I wouldn't say you're going to waste your time watching it, but other than that I wouldn't really seek this movie out.  Just don't have high expectations and you'll get some enjoyment I suspect.  Maybe I just have a more positive outlook on this because I was expecting an actually terrible film with absolutely no coherent story or good acting!

The original ""Boogeyman"" film was released in 1980 with the cast of Suzanna Love, Michael Love, Ron James, John Carradine and Raymond Boyden.  It was followed by Stephen King's The Boogeyman (1982) and Boogeyman II (1983).Twenty-five years later, the Boogeyman story is rehashed. Some of us didn't know of a ""Boogeyman"" until Jamie Lee Curtis said it in HALLOWEEN (1978).In this new version, a boy, Timmy (Aaron Murphy), is being scared by a thunderstorm as he lay in bed to go to sleep.  Strange occurences happen in his bedroom.  When he turns on lamp, the occurences suddenly stop.  Just then, his jacket grows into a dark figure and comes after him.  Timmy quickly turns on the light.  The jacket falls to the floor with nothing in it.  He puts the jacket away.  The lamp falls. Something is in the closet.  The door opens.  Timmy hides under the sheets.  he sees the dark figure come towards him, but it is only his dad (Charles Mesure).  His dad checks the closet for him.  Nothing in their.  Suddenly the dark figure grabs Timmy's dad into the closet and ultimatly sees his dad murdered.Now fifteen years later, Timmy (Barry Watson) still has his fears and when the strange occurences begin again, he relizes he must go back to the house of his childhood and deal with the Boogeyman again.DVD includes alternate endings, several deleted scenes, behind-the-scene interviews.Followed by:Boogeyman 2 (2007-direct to video)Boogeyman 3 (2009-direct to video, January 20, 2009)",4,He's in your closet waiting.,1122681600,"07 30, 2005",2005,1530,"['Yet', 'remake', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'classic', 'original', 'Boogeyman', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1980', 'cast', 'Suzanna', 'Love', 'Michael', 'Love', 'Ron', 'James', 'John', 'Carradine', 'Raymond', 'Boyden', 'was', 'followed', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Boogeyman', '1982', 'Boogeyman', 'II', '1983', '.Twenty-five', 'years', 'later', 'Boogeyman', 'story', 'rehashed', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Boogeyman', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'said', 'HALLOWEEN', '1978', '.In', 'new', 'version', 'boy', 'Timmy', 'Aaron', 'Murphy', 'being', 'scared', 'thunderstorm', 'lay', 'bed', 'go', 'sleep', 'Strange', 'happen', 'bedroom', 'When', 'lamp', 'occurences', 'suddenly', 'stop', 'Just', 'then', 'jacket', 'dark', 'figure', 'Timmy', 'quickly', 'light', 'jacket', 'floor', 'nothing', 'jacket', 'away', 'lamp', 'Something', 'closet', 'door', 'Timmy', 'hides', 'sheets', 'dark', 'figure', 'come', 'towards', 'only', 'dad', 'Charles', 'Mesure', 'dad', 'closet', 'Nothing', 'Suddenly', 'dark', 'figure', 'Timmy', 'dad', 'closet', 'ultimatly', 'dad', 'murdered.Now', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'Timmy', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'still', 'fears', 'when', 'strange', 'occurences', 'begin', 'again', 'must', 'go', 'back', 'house', 'childhood', 'deal', 'Boogeyman', 'again.DVD', 'alternate', 'endings', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'behind-the-scene', 'interviews.Followed', 'Boogeyman', '2', '2007-direct', 'video', 'Boogeyman', '3', '2009-direct', 'video', 'January', '20', '2009']",Boogeyman

The 2005 film ""Boogeyman"". Do you know what all of these things have in common? If you said they were epic disasters that claimed human lives, you win a prize. You might question the inclusion of that last item, the film directed by Stephen T. Kay and produced by none other than Sam Raimi. How could a movie claim lives? ""Boogeyman"" likely killed no one (the number of fatalities aren't in yet), but I think it's safe to say that this clunker claimed the career of one Barry Watson, a former cast member of ""7th Heaven"" and a one time co-star of popular actress Jessica Biel. It must kill Barry that Biel's star keeps rising while his founders in dreck like this. That's Hollywood for you. Then again, Watson didn't seem to understand an important horror film fact, one that angers fans of the genre to no end. That fact, in a nutshell, is this: WE HATE PG-13 RATED HORROR FILMS! ""Horror"" and ""PG-13"" don't go together, period. We want blood and guts and scares. We do not want Barry Watson in a PG-13 rated horror flick.""Boogeyman"" starts off promising (Then again, so did I. Now look where I've ended up--reviewing films like this one.) as we see a young kid in bed at night, horrified of the creature that lives in his closet. Dad ambles in just in time to explain that there is no such thing as the ""Boogeyman"" immediately prior to the non-existing Boogeyman pulling him into the closet. Dad, despite a brief reappearance seconds later, disappears forever. Flash forward fifteen years (too bad we can't flash forward to the closing credits), and we now see the aforementioned little tyke, Tim Jensen, suddenly assume the form of a grown up Barry Watson. Tim, who also seems to fear an electric shaver, tries to move on with his life the best he can. He's a big shot at a magazine, and he's involved with a beautiful girl named Jessica (Tory Mussett). There's some song and dance about meeting her parents--I don't know...I wasn't paying attention--followed by scenes showing Jensen's obvious fear of closets. A few minutes later, Tim experiences some sort of vision/dream concerning his mother (played by Lucy Lawless) that forces him to return to his childhood home.In short, Mom died. This means Tim has to attend her funeral and then go back to the domicile alone. After a ridiculous scene on the road, Jensen arrives at a house so run down it makes the Addams family digs look like the Trump Towers. He soon runs into a childhood friend, Kate (Emily Deschanel paying her mortgage), before the real weirdness starts. Some of the strangeness involves an enigmatic youngster named Franny (Skye McCole Bartusiak). Most of it involves the reappearance, and subsequent disappearance, of Tim's girlfriend Jessica. Soon the madness engulfs Kate as well. People appear and then disappear with frightening regularity, usually after entering a closet. Time and space mean nothing as Tim lurches from one improbable reality to another. Needless to say, it's the Boogeyman who stands behind this lunacy. Or is it Tim? Kate suspects he did something sinister to his girlfriend. Maybe Jensen's fear of the Boogeyman, coupled with the return to his childhood home, has resulted in a psychotic break of epic proportions. Never fear, however, as the conclusion explains everything in dreary detail. As an aside, the end of ""Boogeyman"" ranks as one of the lamest showdowns I've ever seen during my cinematic excursions.Where to start with this nightmare? Other reviewers have rightly noted the mind-deadening reliance on sound effects to get a cheap scare out of the audience, so I won't go there except to say they're absolutely, positively correct. I could rail against the jarring editing techniques, so overused here that they negate any impact the film might have had on an audience above the age of fourteen. The acting isn't any better. With the exception of Emily Deschanel, one wonders what medication the rest of the cast took before stepping in front of the camera. My guess is Thorazine. Except for Barry Watson during the scenes where he grooves along the walls in the closet. In this instance, his behavior closely mirrors someone on the last day of a month long cough syrup binge. I think it's safe to say that just about every element of ""Boogeyman"" fails to project serious scares. The lack of gore and the lack of a scary monster is just the icing on this terrible tasting cake. Here's something truly scary, though: ""Boogeyman 2"" is coming to a theater near you in the future! How is that remotely possible? Because this movie grossed 46 million dollars! Gawd help us!The movie looks great, and sounds great, on DVD. No problem there. As for supplements, we get a few deleted scenes, some special effects mumbo jumbo, a documentary that devolves into a lovefest between cast and crew, some animated storyboards, and an alternate ending. Trailers for a few other films round out the disc. I'm greatly disappointed that I spent ninety minutes of my life watching this crud. It's not scary, not bloody, and not that well acted. The idea isn't bad, especially the mind bending second half where we start to question the reality of what's going on, but it's not unique and comes far too late to save the film. I'm actually agonizing over whether to give ""Boogeyman"" one or two stars. I guess I'll go with the latter, as I usually round up when in doubt.

They made you think this was going to be a scary, Nightmare on Elm Street type of flick but it's nothing like that. For one thing, you're never sure whether the hero, played very well by Barry Watson, is dreaming or imagining or whether the events are real. He keeps going into these rooms where he knows the boogeyman is waiting for him but does he even carry a weapon of some kind? Nooooooo. I couldn't tell whether his father was really captured by the boogeyman or whether this was a dream. This movie tries hard to be like ""The Others"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" but doesn't come anywhere close.

And even with those low expectations, this movie was still pretty awful. Here's why:1)  For one thing, it is NOT suspenseful in the least.  The movie relies heavily on ""jump out at you"" scares (with the shrieking, shrill soundtrack to back it up)--but those scares are so silly that they don't succeed in making you do anything but roll your eyes.  For example, one great scare is when he walks into a closet and is suddenly and inexplicably attacked by clothes hangers (not really, he just has a total freak out and keeps backing up into clothes hangers... over, and over, and over...No really, it lasts about two minutes).2)  The ""surprises"" are not surprising.  I won't give any spoilers as to who, but some of the people in this movie are already dead. In the world of post ""Sixth Sense"" viewers, it's not hard to figure out who's already bitten the dust right from the minute you meet them.3)  The story is awfully familiar.... didn't I just watch this a couple of years ago in a movie called ""Darkness Falls""??  A guy who sees a loved one murdered by a supernatural figure and then spends his life getting ridiculed for it?  And then goes home to finally put things to rest and get on with his life?  Been there, done that, and as sad as it sounds, I was more scared in Darkness Falls.... at least that stupid Tooth Fairy scared me a little bit once I saw her!  The boogeyman in this movie looked like a cartoon.4)  The story is RIDICULOUS.  He walks into a closet and is suddenly in a hotel room!  And he's suddenly in the past!  And then some girl from his childhood appears out of nowhere!  And then he goes into a closet and he's back home!  And then his childhood friend appears again out of nowhere!  And then some silly girl who likes to follow him around shows up, talking all weird and making no sense.  And then his girlfriend shows up out of nowhere and then disappears!  And ..... you get the point.Overall folks, this is NOT a scary movie.

Boogeyman isn't a sequel to Boogie Nights, or even an homage to K.C. and the Sunshine Band. It's another creep in the closet experiment in terror, and I'm not talking about that night Uncle Arthur hid out in my walk-in sniffing the lining of my sneakers.Boogeyman is about things that go bump in the night, childhood monsters that hide under the bed, in the shadows, or in the closet. Don't bring the kiddies, because this isn't Monster, Inc., even though everything about Boogeyman feels manufactured.Director Stephen T. Kay (Get Carter) wraps Boogeyman in a veneer of spooky images, creating an appropriate sense of doom and dread. Kay effectively manipulates light and shadows, slicing the screen into a mind-bending blend of fact and fantasy. Deciphering that reality is young Tim Jensen, whose room becomes a veritable Grimm Fairy Tale when the lights go off.As a boy, Tim's father was sucked into the closet never to be seen again. Now an adult, Tim (Barry Watson) is still haunted by memories of the Boogeyman. His life is constantly subjected to childhood flashbacks, forcing Tim to confront his past once and for all. When Tim's mother (Lucy Lawless, sans sword) dies, he heads home, using the trip to heal old woundsWith the encouragement of his shrink, Tim decides to spend the night in his old childhood home, hoping to put an end to his nightmares. Instead, Tim is immediately visited by a spirit who informs him he is the only one who can bring down the Boogeyman. Traditional dream warrior crap, served up on a shiny dish that can't disguise the fact that it's still crap.Boogeyman boasts three writers but doesn't contain one original idea. In order to hide the fact that they have nothing, the writers attempt to engage us in a series of mind games. Closets are used as portals, and if this were a comedy, this device might have been funny. Instead, it feels like a strained attempt to make a purse out of a sow's testicle sack.The young cast throw around as much weight as their stick figure characters allow, but they're nothing more than props in this stylized fun house that isn't really that much fun. The director and writers toss in the customary shocks, and while they're designed for maximum impact, they buckle under their own logic.When the theater lights come up, this Boogeyman is nothing but a bad memory.",2,BOOGIE OOGIE UGH!,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,2396,"['Sorry', 'can', 'put', 'away', 'bell', 'bottoms', 'disco', 'shoes', 'Boogeyman', ""n't"", 'sequel', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'even', 'homage', 'K.C', 'Sunshine', 'Band', 'creep', 'closet', 'experiment', 'terror', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'night', 'Uncle', 'Arthur', 'out', 'walk-in', 'sniffing', 'lining', 'sneakers.Boogeyman', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'childhood', 'monsters', 'hide', 'bed', 'shadows', 'closet', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'kiddies', ""n't"", 'Monster', 'Inc.', 'even', 'everything', 'Boogeyman', 'feels', 'manufactured.Director', 'Stephen', 'T.', 'Kay', 'Get', 'Carter', 'Boogeyman', 'veneer', 'spooky', 'images', 'creating', 'appropriate', 'sense', 'doom', 'dread', 'Kay', 'effectively', 'light', 'shadows', 'slicing', 'screen', 'mind-bending', 'blend', 'fact', 'fantasy', 'Deciphering', 'reality', 'young', 'Tim', 'Jensen', 'room', 'veritable', 'Grimm', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'when', 'lights', 'go', 'off.As', 'boy', 'Tim', 'father', 'was', 'sucked', 'closet', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'Now', 'adult', 'Tim', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'still', 'haunted', 'memories', 'Boogeyman', 'life', 'constantly', 'subjected', 'childhood', 'flashbacks', 'forcing', 'Tim', 'confront', 'past', 'once', 'When', 'Tim', 'mother', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'sword', 'home', 'using', 'trip', 'heal', 'old', 'woundsWith', 'encouragement', 'shrink', 'Tim', 'spend', 'night', 'old', 'childhood', 'home', 'hoping', 'put', 'end', 'nightmares', 'Instead', 'Tim', 'immediately', 'visited', 'spirit', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'bring', 'down', 'Boogeyman', 'Traditional', 'dream', 'warrior', 'crap', 'served', 'up', 'shiny', 'dish', 'ca', ""n't"", 'disguise', 'fact', 'still', 'crap.Boogeyman', 'boasts', 'three', 'writers', ""n't"", 'contain', 'one', 'original', 'idea', 'order', 'hide', 'fact', 'have', 'nothing', 'writers', 'attempt', 'engage', 'series', 'mind', 'games', 'Closets', 'are', 'used', 'portals', 'were', 'comedy', 'device', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'Instead', 'strained', 'attempt', 'make', 'purse', 'sow', 'testicle', 'sack.The', 'young', 'cast', 'throw', 'as', 'much', 'weight', 'stick', 'figure', 'characters', 'allow', ""'re"", 'nothing', 'more', 'props', 'stylized', 'fun', 'house', ""n't"", 'really', 'that', 'much', 'fun', 'director', 'writers', 'toss', 'customary', 'shocks', ""'re"", 'designed', 'maximum', 'impact', 'buckle', 'own', 'logic.When', 'theater', 'lights', 'come', 'up', 'Boogeyman', 'nothing', 'bad', 'memory']",Boogeyman

I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...I hardly ever go to the movies anymore because today's movies can't compare to the movies of previous decades, and horror movies are the biggest letdown nowadays.  I'm turned off by 98% of the horror movie remakes and most of the non-remakes.  I remember seeing Boogeyman in the theater when it came out in 2005.  I was not impressed.  I was underwhelmed and rolling my eyes.  When the movie was over and the credits started rolling, people just quietly got up and exited the theater.  This is a typical horror movie of today - there are a lot of jump-out-of-your-seat moments where suddenly something comes out of nowhere and catches you off guard, causing you to jump out of your seat.  How typical nowadays.  Also, it's loaded with CGI.The best era for horror movies was the 1970s and 1980s.  The 1920s, 1930s, '40s, '50s, and '60s were great as well, with the Universal, Hammer, and Amicus movies.

Ninety-nine times out of one hundred, if it doesn't make sense, then it is a lie.Something similar works for art. If it doesn't make any sense, not only has the audience been egregiously deceived, but the film simply doesn't work.That's what happens here.The first hour of this film is filled with ""blank"". Nothing. The main character (in an interesting turn from his character on Seventh Heaven - and I LIKE that) looks around a bit, obviously creeped out. With a few very minor exceptions, that's about it. In addition, the minor exceptions don't hold up to the litmus test of: does it make sense. Those exceptions don't make sense, so they're eliminated entirely from the story line.I'll give the film credit for making an attempt to create something that's almost ""Memento meets horror"". There is some paranormal time shifting going on, but again, we're not given enough information for any of that to make sense. This begs the question: can we make sense of it? The answer is yes, to a certain degree - but only if we throw all reason and logic out the window. Let me compare this to another film, so that perhaps some perspective can be brought into the picture: could we make sense of The Exorcist? You bet we could. That simply isn't going on here. Props for a decent attempt, though.I'd like to comment on the ending - especially as that's the only truly interesting part of the film, and even that's confusing and a major letdown - but I won't. There really are no surprises, but who knows? Someone might be surprised. Suffice to say that my five-year-old nephew figured out the ending, and to make it worse, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

The plot concerns The Boogeyman - literally, not metaphorically, as Halloween did.  It begins with a terrified little boy in his bedroom, in the dark, looking nervously at his closet and other menacing objects around the room.  Now, problems with the movie begin right here.  Nobody, I mean NOBODY - not even Rob Zombie - would have a room this creepy for a child.  Who would painstakingly arrange clothes and a baseball bat on a rocking chair to look like a scary monster?  When the little boy's father comes in to investigate, he is sucked into the bedroom closet, never to be seen or heard from again.Cut to many years later; the little boy has now grown up into an extremely nervous, but good-looking young man.  His mother's death forces him to go back to his old house where the Boogeyman lives.  Now things begin to go REALLY wrong with the movie.  First off, it gets the tone wrong.  The filmmakers try to make EVERY moment creepy - even when nothing is happening.  You just can't do that - horror films need moments of calm reality before going off into moments of high-tension.  Try to keep the tension high at all times effectively nullifies it in this film.Next, the film makes no logical sense.  Characters just do things that can't be explained by any other reason than ""it advances the plot.""  Why would the hero spend so much time alone in a house with the Boogeyman?  The mythology of the movie doesn't make ANY sense either.  What is the Boogeyman?  Is he omnipotent?  Where does he come from?  What, exactly, does he do with his victims?As the film lumbers towards its conclusion, things get completely surreal.  The hero goes into ""closetland"" - for lack of a better term - to fight the Boogeyman.  The audience gets completely lost in this convoluted chase.  The payoff - a lame, CGI monster - dispels any sense of dread that might have been created.  And then the movie just stops.  There is a moment when we ask, Is that all there is?  That's all there is.

Cockrel,"[12, 14]","Is it just me or did anyone else notice that ""Boogeyman"" is almost a scene for scene rip off of the much better 2003 movie, ""Darkness Falls""?Don't believe me?  Check it out:1) Both movies open with a young boys in their bedrooms at night who are afraid to go to sleep because they fear that mythical beings from folklore will come and harm them.  In ""Darkness Falls,"" it's a vengeful Tooth Fairy.  In the Boogeyman it's well, duh, the Boogeyman.2) In both movies these scenes end with the young boys watching in helpless terror as said mythical beings slaughter a parent.  In ""Darkness Falls,""  Mom buys the farm.  In ""Boogeyman"" it's Dad that gets it.3)  After the previous scene, both movies jump forward several years to the same boys as young men.  In both cases, they remain so traumatized by the prior events that they've even adapted their living quarters to fend off future attacks they believe will one day come.  In ""Darkness"" hero Chaney Kley's apartment has more lights than the Las Vegas strip since the Tooth Fairy can only exist in darkness.  In ""Boogeyman,"" every closet or cupboard in Barry Watson's apartment is windowed so that he can see if the Boogeyman is hiding inside before opening.4)  In both movies, the young heroes are forced by a tragic events to return to their hometowns where they must face the evils that have haunted their dreams since childhood.  And once they hit town, both young men immediately reconnect with old childhood flames who've not surprisingly grown up into serious hotties.5) Lastly, both movies also end with frantic, climaxes where the young heroes use their wits to dispatch their supernatural enemies in explosive finishes.Seriously, I could go on but what's point?  There is one significant difference here though.  ""Darkness Falls"" is actually an okay movie where as ""Boogeyman"" kinda sucks.To its credit, the opening scene(though as I said it's a ripoff) is a killer and had me genuinely creeped out.  But after that the movie descends into scene after scene of Watson  moping around.The few original story elements the movie does try to use like the Boogeyman and his origins don't work.  The movie doesn't really explain who or what the Boogeyman is though there are suggestions that any child who fears the Boogeyman deeply enough can make him real.Bottom line this one's not only a loser but also such a blatant ripoff of ""Darkness Falls"" that if I were the attorney for the scriptwriter of that film I'd probably recommend filing a copyright infringement lawsuit.",1,"I Liked This Movie Better When It Was Called ""Darkness Falls""",1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,2526,"['just', 'did', 'anyone', 'else', 'Boogeyman', 'almost', 'scene', 'scene', 'rip', 'much', 'better', '2003', 'movie', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Check', 'movies', 'open', 'young', 'boys', 'bedrooms', 'night', 'who', 'are', 'afraid', 'go', 'sleep', 'fear', 'mythical', 'beings', 'folklore', 'will', 'come', 'harm', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'vengeful', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Boogeyman', 'well', 'duh', 'Boogeyman.2', 'movies', 'scenes', 'end', 'young', 'boys', 'watching', 'helpless', 'terror', 'said', 'mythical', 'beings', 'slaughter', 'parent', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'Mom', 'farm', 'Boogeyman', 'Dad', 'it.3', 'previous', 'scene', 'movies', 'jump', 'forward', 'several', 'years', 'same', 'boys', 'young', 'men', 'cases', 'remain', 'so', 'traumatized', 'prior', 'events', ""'ve"", 'even', 'adapted', 'living', 'quarters', 'fend', 'off', 'future', 'attacks', 'believe', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'come', 'Darkness', 'hero', 'Chaney', 'Kley', 'apartment', 'more', 'lights', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'strip', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'can', 'only', 'exist', 'darkness', 'Boogeyman', 'closet', 'cupboard', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'apartment', 'windowed', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'Boogeyman', 'hiding', 'opening.4', 'movies', 'young', 'heroes', 'are', 'forced', 'tragic', 'events', 'return', 'hometowns', 'where', 'must', 'face', 'evils', 'have', 'haunted', 'dreams', 'childhood', 'once', 'hit', 'town', 'young', 'men', 'immediately', 'reconnect', 'old', 'childhood', 'flames', 'who', ""'ve"", 'not', 'surprisingly', 'grown', 'up', 'serious', 'hotties.5', 'Lastly', 'movies', 'also', 'end', 'frantic', 'climaxes', 'where', 'young', 'heroes', 'use', 'wits', 'dispatch', 'supernatural', 'enemies', 'explosive', 'finishes.Seriously', 'could', 'go', 'what', 'point', 'one', 'significant', 'difference', 'here', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'actually', 'okay', 'movie', 'where', 'Boogeyman', 'kinda', 'sucks.To', 'credit', 'opening', 'scene', 'said', 'ripoff', 'killer', 'had', 'genuinely', 'creeped', 'out', 'movie', 'scene', 'scene', 'Watson', 'moping', 'around.The', 'few', 'original', 'story', 'movie', 'try', 'use', 'Boogeyman', 'origins', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'who', 'what', 'Boogeyman', 'are', 'suggestions', 'child', 'who', 'Boogeyman', 'deeply', 'enough', 'can', 'make', 'real.Bottom', 'line', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'loser', 'also', 'such', 'blatant', 'ripoff', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'were', 'attorney', 'scriptwriter', 'film', ""'d"", 'probably', 'recommend', 'filing', 'copyright', 'infringement', 'lawsuit']",Boogeyman

But this endless barrage of PG-13 horror/ghost movies is becoming quite hard to deal with. It was fun to bash them at first but now it's getting quite annoying. And I wouldn't mind these PG-13 ""scary"" movies if any of them had some substance to them! Take for example this little movie. You take a simple idea like the boogeyman, the archetype of childhood fear, and decide to make a movie centered around this idea. You would think an idea like this may infact conjure up something original, right? Think again, buddy. This movie is basically about a guy who rumages through closets and sees flashes of ""scary"" stuff and runs from shadows. It's actually quite amazing that something as original as the boogeyman would not suffice a satisfactory end-result in a movie. Only the idiots who made this movie could've done it.The only thing going for this movie was it's opening sequence. There it is, done and over with. The rest of the movie literally goes nowhere, and has absolutely nothing going for it that would be able to take it anywhere.

I went out and got this movie not too long ago and i actually liked it alot. It had alot of parts during the movie where it would make me jump from the closet slaming n all. I really liked the actual Boogeyman at the end of the movie. The special effects were not the best, but i still think they were good and it made a good looking boogeyman to me. The story was good. I liked this one better than the 2nd Boogeyman because the Boogeyman was actually real in this one. He was quick and had some ""throwing around"" of the actors at the final confrontation of the Boogeyman. I think this movie deserved alot better than what it got.

Barry Watson, whom since being in 7th Heav, has been cast A LOT of really mediocre films(Teaching Mrs. Tingle & Sorority Boys for example). 2. Its the Boogeyman. After seeing Darkness Falls and the Crapsterpiece that was, seeing as this looked similar, it didn't show a lot of promise. The only reason I even went to see it was because Sam Raimi was associated with it, as the producer. And seeing as he has made some great horror like ""Evil Dead"", it looked like it could have promise.Well, after seeing it, I can honestly say that its better than ""Ugh and Megh"". Its effective in its own way. Yes it has a nice little obsession with doors and claustriphobic cinematography(I HOPE that wasn't too many BIG words!!! ;P), but besides that, and the constant Loud burst of music in ""scary"" moments, it has a lot of good points.!The disjointed story-telling, and unsureness of reality keeps you guessing about the sanity of ""Tim(Barry Watson)"", a child whom ""supposedly"" saw his father killed by the Boogeyman!!! After having an encounter with his dead mother(Lucy Lawless), he decides he needs to spend the night in his childhood home and gather up his mothers things in order to overcome this ""dillusion"". ;P Of course, a lot things start happening.

Tim's (an effective Barry Watson) fear of dark confined spaces is elevated to the hilt when mortal circumstances force him to return home and spend the night in his abandoned family home. Before you can say seen-this-done-that, our hero is propelled into stylishly executed encounters where bumps-in-the-night and jumping-in-your-seat moments are aplenty.  Yes, this type of nerve cracking moviemaking has been done before, but not as elegantly or as atmospherically distressing as Stephen T. Kay's direction is. His use of every littlest details impresses. From the litter of junk in the shed to the writing on the soiled walls, everything, and anything, is aimed to scare.  As are the digitally-made shadows representing the boogeyman, which add substance to this ballet-choreographed spookiness.  Only when he manifests himself towards the conclusion does BOOGEYMAN disappoint.  His presence ends up looking more computerized than real.  As for the ending, well, let's just say that editing can sometimes hurt a film.  Obviously a better hand at cutting and splicing wouldn't have hurt.

Of course, one doesn't expect a lot of substance from a horror movie, but the better ones are based on a working script. ""Boogeyman"" seems to be one of those productions that underwent lots of rewrites during filming.The movie begins promisingly, even if it is the old `it was a dark and stormy night' motif. A young boy named Tim is too scared to sleep. Laying in his bed, he keeps imagining there is an evil presence in the closet of his bedroom. His father comes in to reassure the boy that there is no such thing as the `boogeyman'. Suddenly, the closet door flies open, and a monstrous thing grabs Dad and pulls him into the closet. Dad is never seen again.Fifteen years later, Tim [Barry Watson] is a handsome, neurotic young man. Years of therapy have him almost convinced that he imagined his father's disappearance. He decides to return home to house where all his problems began.

In spite of some atmospheric creepiness, BOOGEYMAN fails to chill as it intended.  Barry Watson, a rather wooden actor, has the central role of Tim, a young man haunted by memories of his father being sucked into the closet by the boogeyman.  Of course, no one believes him and it is assumed that Tim's pop just up and ran off, leaving behind a drug-addicted mother (briefly played by Lucy Lawless, no Xena here, folks).  Tim's life has never really recovered from this experience, and he is now working for a magazine and has a sweetheart named Jessica.  Upon the death of his mother, Tim returns to the old homestead to pack up her things, and of course to face the boogeyman of his childhood.  Tim meets a strange little girl (played with little life by Skye McCole Bartusiak) and his old childhood playmate (a lovely Emily Deschanel), but the movie never makes any coherent sense as Tim goes in one closet in a motel and comes out in the closet at home, and we get several jarring sequences of doors slamming and opening and a final confrontation with the boogeyman.At least the movie doesn't rely on gore or sexual distractions, and it does have some spooky moments, but overall, BOOGEYMAN joins films like ALONE IN THE DARK and DARKNESS as inferior horror films of the new millenium.",3,OUT OF THE CLOSET,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,1415,"['BOOGEYMAN', 'trend', 'modern', 'horror', 'movies', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'how', 'truly', 'scare', 'audiences', 'spite', 'atmospheric', 'creepiness', 'BOOGEYMAN', 'chill', 'intended', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'rather', 'wooden', 'actor', 'central', 'role', 'Tim', 'young', 'man', 'haunted', 'memories', 'father', 'being', 'sucked', 'closet', 'boogeyman', 'course', 'one', 'assumed', 'Tim', 'pop', 'just', 'up', 'ran', 'off', 'leaving', 'drug-addicted', 'mother', 'played', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'Xena', 'here', 'folks', 'Tim', 'life', 'never', 'really', 'recovered', 'experience', 'now', 'working', 'magazine', 'sweetheart', 'named', 'Jessica', 'death', 'mother', 'Tim', 'old', 'homestead', 'pack', 'up', 'things', 'course', 'face', 'boogeyman', 'childhood', 'Tim', 'strange', 'little', 'girl', 'played', 'little', 'life', 'Skye', 'McCole', 'Bartusiak', 'old', 'childhood', 'playmate', 'lovely', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'movie', 'never', 'coherent', 'sense', 'Tim', 'one', 'closet', 'motel', 'out', 'closet', 'home', 'get', 'several', 'jarring', 'sequences', 'doors', 'slamming', 'opening', 'final', 'confrontation', 'boogeyman.At', 'least', 'movie', ""n't"", 'rely', 'gore', 'sexual', 'distractions', 'have', 'spooky', 'moments', 'overall', 'BOOGEYMAN', 'films', 'ALONE', 'IN', 'THE', 'DARK', 'DARKNESS', 'inferior', 'horror', 'films', 'new', 'millenium']",Boogeyman

Flash forward to present day, where Tim (Barry Watson) is trying to fit in with the family of his rich girlfriend Jess (Tory Mussett). Things take a turn for the worse when Tim's background arises at the dinner table and soon after Tim gets a call about the death of his mother (Lucy Lawless) - the tragic event that will soon bring Tim back to face his worst fears.All this time, Tim's been told that his father left him and that he created a fantasy - the boogeyman ate him - to explain it.  But that fiction comes to an end when Tim returns to his old home for the funeral, where everything in his room is exactly how he left it that night.  There's the ugly lamp, the looming coat, the bizarre raven toy, the monster toy, and the electric crystal ball. They manifest in different ways throughout the film, which is clever.What isn't clever is the rest of the plot.  The audience might think the boogeyman is a figment of Tim's demented imagination up to a point, until said boogeyman starts suffocating people with plastic wrap and killing their girlfriends.  Then it's just a bog-standard slasher flick that echoes scarier movies that have gone before.  There's an inspired moment of dimensional hopping between scenes via closets, but it's lost in all the jump cuts and screaming.When Tim finally does overcome his fears and discovers the truth about the boogeyman, it's too little, too late.

No surprise that this movie was not scary, just a few startling noises, sound effects, whispers, and creaks in the stairs, but nothing really made sense. The end was kind of retarded, the shots were too quick you can't really see what's going on and if you did get a glimpse here and there it didn't make sense.

I noticed alot of ideas were borrowed from other movies, nothing original here sorry. And i agree that at the beginning when the dad is thrown all around the room by the closet monster and all bloody and then gone forever, the kid just sat there, with a little look of surprise. Not very realistic or believable. Screaming, running out of the room, crying, would have made it a better beginning. What a dumb idea. Before writing a story about fear, maybe these writers need a lesson on human reactions, especially when it comes to children. But anyway, this movie wasn't horrible, it was just lacking everything a successful horror movie needs. I think if i saw it in theatre's i wouldnt be too bored but it's not one i'd ever want to see a second time. Maybe it was barry's good looks that kept me watching who knows. But as far as creativity, intelligence, and originality, nope. One very important failure is the boogeyman's look, very uncreative. I would have had fun with it.

Tim (Barry Watson) confronts his past in order to relieve his present stance of the memory that burdens him daily as he pursues to live a normal person's life.Taking the advice of his girlfriend and a woman whom he knew as a younger boy after the incident, he journeys back into the old house which he tries to forget. During his stay there, he not only found out the truths of the myth of the Boogeyman (Andrew Glover), his past has also been reintroduced into his life and plays back in his mind like a film he thought he had forgotten and put aside long ago.Through all the mystery he comes upon the truth of his childhood which haunted him so, about his Dad's death that very night as he was a little boy. He also came upon the truth of the missing children and the old man who tried to capture the Boogeyman himself, single-handedly.Like I said, a suspense-filled film.

Something that was going to delve into and bring alive our childhood fears that lurked in the dark and behind creaky doors left slightly a jar. I waited for months for it to be available on DVD after I had missed it at the Movie Cinema.The build up was the most exciting part of the whole movie and due to that, the slump and boredom that followed in the movie was made 10x worse.Probably the biggest let down I've had on a DVD ever...First off, the story picks up with an awesome opening scene, which is quite terrifying and then slumps along at such a slow pace, and never really picks up enough to get us interested again.Barry Watson looks half asleep for the majority of the film and really does not portray anything that resembles a memorable / likeable character. He seems to call his performance in and allows the special effects and storyline to do much of the work. His supporting cast are just as miserable... and really leaves nothing to work with.So... a few 'frights' here and there and a small build up at the end to what we've all come to see ""THE BOOGEYMAN"" and he is the most pathetic visual effect of the whole. I would have at least spent a bit on a Rick Baker monster with blood covered fangs, claws, deep set eyes and rotting flesh and a heavy breathing.

Anything will do... just get me a Boogeyman script!!Big mistake.Because this movie has nothing to offer. The story is dull, the characters are flat and both the script and directing go nowhere.The story is about a kid who witnessed his dad being sucked into the closet by the Boogeyman. Years later, his mom dies and he comes back to hie weird small town to ""confront his fears"". His house is an old victorian house in the middle of nowhere with a funeral home appeal (church-colored windows and all).First Major flaw: How do you make a film about a mythic monster nobody realy knows how it looks? How do you create a monster that will match all kids' worst nightmare at the same time? Look at all movie monsters. From Santa Claus to King Kong to Freddy Kruger we do know how those characters look, act and move. That's why they are such a delight to watch.Here, nobody knew what to do in order to have a real monster. The result is that the film spends an awful amount of time avoiding the monster and depending on cheap,fast,loud outbursts of images and noises everytime the main character touches a doorknob... looks into a mirror... or falls asleep.It is funny (and disappointing) how cheap horror movies nowadays rely on these silly editting effects in order to make the viewers jump on their seats. The result? Nobody jumps anymore because we all know the half-second outburst of loud images is coming when we see the guy's hand slowly approaching the doorknob. The hand goes inch by inch... suddenly half-second of woosh-aaargh-bang!... and then we're back: the guy opens the door and nothing happens... it was just his mind playing tricks. Duh!Then come all those things we've seen (better made) somewhere alse. The idea of comuncating closets comes from a 1986 (good) movie called ""House"". The sudden alternative recreations of past events comes from (among many others) David Lynch. The bird against the windshield AND the eerie old house come from Hitchcock. The girl we are not so sure is a ghost comes from ""The Sixth Sense""-ish films... boy, this movie is mixed bag of:a) stollen good ideasb) ideas that are so bad nobody ever bothered to have them.The vilain (the Boogeyman) is never there. And when he is, he passes fast in the background when nobody is looking. The whole movie is like this. In the end, the guy wins by doing something so irrelevant I can't even remember what it was (laughs). And yes: its look is disappointing!!! An ugly guy with an elastic body!!!! Can it get worse??? Yes, it can. Because......Obviously, the closet will open again for a direct-to-DVD sequel. Want some advice?

The visuals of BOOGEYMAN really suck you in... too bad that there's not much to keep you there after you've arrived.The negatives:Other than Barry Watson, all of the other actors range from slightly flat to embarassingly terrible.The script would have made a good 20 minute short.  Unfortunately, this feature pads it's run time with useless visual effects sequences, boring subplots about Barry Watson's annoying girlfriend (and even more annoying family) and a supporting character: a little girl who we know from the first moment is a ghost... who is there to provide information ...though she never really does.In the behind-the-scenes of the DVD, the director, Stephen Kay, sounds like a very smart man.  So I wonder why he made so many bad decisions for this movie.  His worst decision:  Slapping the viewer every two minutes with screeching, annoying, ""startling"" hyper-cut bursts of imagery that mean nothing.  This tactic in modern horror movies did not work when they started overusing it a few years ago... and this tactic has only grown more annoying over the years... culminating to an infuriating peak with BOOGEYMAN.And the worst thing about BOOGEYMAN:  The bad guy that we are all supposed to be afraid of is a CGI blob.  PLEASE, horror filmmakers.... STOP using CGI to create ""supernatural"" imagery, or bad guys, or whatever.  It looks fake.  It is not scary!Avoid BOOGEYMAN.",2,A waste of talent...

Is a horror-movie deep and moving? And usually smart? Well, I guess ""The Others"" and ""Sixth Sence"" could be described as this -but there is a big difference here between this old-fashioned horror-design and the ""new"" thriller-wave that's made its' mark since ""Sixth Sence"". I did not expect much explanation from ""Boogeyman"", I only expected to be entertained -and I was!""Boogeyman"" is simply horror. ""The monster in the closet/under the bed"", the sound-effects that makes you jump or scream (and great sound by the way, dts in the European-edition is amazing), it is based on our worst fears when we are children -and sure brings back some memories of our darkest fantasies. ""Boogeyman"" is so intense that I actually thought it was a little too much at times. The camera-work is great and effective, it takes you where you don't want to go -and I sometimes found myself holding my breath. Perhaps I'm easily scared, I don't know -but I really don't understand that so many people here did not find ""Boogeyman"" scary at all..? And boring? I felt like something was thrown at me constantly while watching, and it really had my attention......until;Here is also another ending that ruins the movie, and it could have been made/designed even a lot more simplier to make it look more scary. A man wearing a black bathrobe or something would have looked ""better"" than the ""Boogeyman"" turned out to be. More scary, I mean. The ending was just confusing, and silly. I think I liked the original ending better, I don't know... Were the filmmakers trying to be nice to the audience there at the end, and make up for all the horror? Well, the entire ending looked cheap and fake -and when first we get to see (or stand face to face if you like) the ""Boogeyman"" it is no longer scary. A bit of a let-down I must add.But it is a frightning horror-movie besides this -intense and builds up -in the good-old-fashioned-style.

Unfortunately, after watching the first few minutes of the movie, I realized what a bad predicament I had gotten myself into.The movie is about Tim, who as a child, catches the boogeyman coming out of the closet and suck his dad into the closet. People tell him he just imagined the whole thing and that his dad actually left the family for other reasons, even though he never sees his dad again. Jump to 15 years later, where Tim and his girlfriend Jessica are meeting Jessica's parents. Tim still hasn't gotten over his fear of the closet. During their stay at Jessica's folks place, Tim gets a call from his uncle Mike, telling him that his mother passed away. After the funeral, Tim decides to stay a night in his old house to get a few of his mother's things; little does he realize that there's something still waiting for him, in the house.While there are a few creepy moments in this movie (for example, the way the monster takes the form of water and gets Jessica in the motel, and the main reason I gave this movie 2 stars), most of the scenes are just loud sound effects that made you jump from your seat, making you feel foolish. Moreover, there are way too many plot holes in this movie, which raises more questions than answers. Why does it decide to come after all these years, just when Tim arrives? Why doesn't Tim realize that the bloody handprint smeared in the bathtub is his, when he visits the motel with Kate? And in the first place, HOW did the Boogeyman even come to being, and why does Tim use the toy soldier in the end?!? While the cast acted pretty good, with the story being so silly, it's hard to take them seriously in the movie.So, in conclusion, watch this movie only if you have way too much free time on your hands, otherwise, just wait for the DVD to release.",2,Boo...ring,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,1904,"['watching', 'trailer', 'Boogeyman', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'scary', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'watching', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'realized', 'what', 'bad', 'predicament', 'had', 'gotten', 'into.The', 'movie', 'Tim', 'who', 'child', 'boogeyman', 'coming', 'closet', 'suck', 'dad', 'closet', 'People', 'tell', 'just', 'imagined', 'whole', 'thing', 'dad', 'actually', 'left', 'family', 'other', 'reasons', 'even', 'never', 'dad', 'again', 'Jump', '15', 'years', 'later', 'where', 'Tim', 'girlfriend', 'Jessica', 'are', 'meeting', 'Jessica', 'parents', 'Tim', 'still', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'fear', 'closet', 'stay', 'Jessica', 'folks', 'place', 'Tim', 'call', 'uncle', 'Mike', 'telling', 'mother', 'passed', 'away', 'funeral', 'Tim', 'stay', 'night', 'old', 'house', 'get', 'few', 'mother', 'things', 'little', 'realize', 'something', 'still', 'waiting', 'house.While', 'are', 'few', 'creepy', 'moments', 'movie', 'example', 'way', 'monster', 'form', 'water', 'Jessica', 'motel', 'main', 'reason', 'gave', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'loud', 'sound', 'effects', 'made', 'jump', 'seat', 'making', 'feel', 'foolish', 'Moreover', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'movie', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'Why', 'decide', 'come', 'years', 'just', 'when', 'Tim', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Tim', 'realize', 'bloody', 'handprint', 'smeared', 'bathtub', 'when', 'motel', 'Kate', 'first', 'place', 'HOW', 'did', 'Boogeyman', 'even', 'come', 'being', 'why', 'Tim', 'use', 'toy', 'soldier', 'end', 'cast', 'acted', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'being', 'so', 'silly', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'movie.So', 'conclusion', 'watch', 'movie', 'only', 'have', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'free', 'time', 'hands', 'otherwise', 'just', 'wait', 'DVD', 'release']",Boogeyman

Boogeyman at least you could understand the true essence of the plot a lot more clearly, the actors definitely were better, and the creature at the end of the film did freak me out for a second. I think this movie made it seem like the Boogeyman is universal, just a bad spirit, and forms into what you imagine it to look like which is what this man, the protagonist in the film, did. I won't spoil the movie but the Boogeyman looks like a few things in his room put together. That was an interesting idea. The whole point of this is that it was something different to watch than the occasional house plagued with mad spirits thing they overdo. This movie was different and not too bad in their difference so I give it a solid three stars. Although in some parts of the movie you could feel lost, in the next scene you usually pick the pieces up quickly. The ending was the best part to me when he finally after running around his house so many times faces the creature once and for all. The ending they first chose, the one they stick with at the end is the best one. The other one, the ending they didn't put in the movie but let you see in the menu, was downright ridiculous. Where was his childhood friend in the second ending? And did you see how he looked standing in the window? He looks like a cartoon colored in! He didn't even look realistic. Now maybe that's because they weren't planning to put it in so they just didn't put much effort into it, they just showed a rough sketch of the second ending. I don't know but the second ending I didn't like at all. Trust me, the first ending, the one they show in the movie, is the best.Overall the movie was all right. I didn't hate it, but I won't be racing to the stores to own it as well. It was good to watch once, but probably never again, unless on t.v. one night when there's nothing else on.",3,Well....,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,2039,"['Well', 'watched', 'two', 'horror', 'movies', 'last', 'night', 'One', 'was', 'Darkness', 'then', 'other', 'was', 'Boogeyman', 'was', 'exactly', 'heart-', 'stopping', 'Boogeyman', 'was', 'heck', 'lot', 'better', 'Boogeyman', 'least', 'could', 'understand', 'true', 'essence', 'plot', 'lot', 'more', 'clearly', 'actors', 'definitely', 'were', 'better', 'creature', 'end', 'film', 'did', 'freak', 'out', 'second', 'think', 'movie', 'made', 'seem', 'Boogeyman', 'universal', 'just', 'bad', 'spirit', 'forms', 'what', 'imagine', 'look', 'what', 'man', 'protagonist', 'film', 'did', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'movie', 'Boogeyman', 'few', 'things', 'room', 'put', 'together', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'whole', 'point', 'was', 'something', 'different', 'watch', 'occasional', 'house', 'plagued', 'mad', 'spirits', 'thing', 'overdo', 'movie', 'was', 'different', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'difference', 'give', 'solid', 'three', 'stars', 'parts', 'movie', 'could', 'feel', 'lost', 'next', 'scene', 'usually', 'pick', 'pieces', 'up', 'quickly', 'ending', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'when', 'finally', 'running', 'around', 'house', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'creature', 'once', 'ending', 'first', 'chose', 'one', 'stick', 'end', 'best', 'one', 'other', 'one', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'movie', 'let', 'see', 'menu', 'was', 'downright', 'ridiculous', 'Where', 'was', 'childhood', 'friend', 'second', 'ending', 'did', 'see', 'how', 'looked', 'standing', 'window', 'cartoon', 'colored', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'realistic', 'Now', 'were', ""n't"", 'planning', 'put', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'much', 'effort', 'just', 'showed', 'rough', 'sketch', 'second', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'second', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Trust', 'first', 'ending', 'one', 'show', 'movie', 'best.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'right', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'racing', 'stores', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'good', 'watch', 'once', 'probably', 'never', 'again', 't.v', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'nothing', 'else']",Boogeyman

Great Sound design, and when you look at the extras, you can see the depth that the story has built in.The Boogeyman plays on the unfocused elements of fear, the things we cannot see; however, if you check out the extras, you can see the guy who embodied the figure of ""Tim's"" fear.The big question is, did Tim make up the monster, or did he have the creature attack him because of ... [ fill in the reason you like].The absence of a commentary track is a big minus.However, if you get the bonus edition from BEST BUY, you get some great extras that supplement the regular special edition. Hopefully for world release, the disc will be incorporated with the regular disc.For those noting the similarities to A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET ( first film), the alternate ending will be very enlightening.And whilst I will acknowledge similarities, they are clearly not copies, they take the concepts one step further, especially if you note that Craven himself took the basis for A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET from some articles in a Newspaper, and combined that with his own background in the humanities, and (probably) in psychology.The deleted scenes are very annoying.

(5) Why didnt they just release it straight to Television. I actually wrote this whilewatching Boogeyman it was so boring i figured id go ahead and start my own review while it put-ters on in the background. Im not angry but i certaintly have lost interest heres why:(1) Sam Raimi needs to stick with ""Spider-Man"". If he really wants to come back into horror heshould be open to re-concpetualizing, and breaking down the way story telling unfolds and canenfold. (2) This chip chop scenery type of video editing is so annoying, it disjoints any senseof continuity. This is the worse editing job ive ever seen and its 55 min into the movie. At thispoint i have to come to one definitive conclusion and that is that they could not possibly rescuethe movie from here. Not uless someone popped out the TV and Handed me a 100 Dollar bill andwas like ""Suprise"" just kidding! or ""Suprise, your on candid camera! Some people berate all films,nothing satisfies them.

896212,A3DMR234MWQYSE,B0007Z2556,S. M. Barden,"[1, 1]","I picked this up on a lark at a store without reading any reviews, based solely on Sam Raimi's role as producer (I'm a big fan of anything he's touched).  Glad I watched it before reading any reviews.In short, I thought this film was a very effective, atmospheric handling of some primal fears that we all have.  Fear of the dark, fear of being alone, fear of creepy old houses, the fear that the worst terrors of our mind will manifest themselves simply because we imagined them, etc.There are many horror movies that take their time to get to the point.  This one gets to the point immediately.  In fact, the first five minutes contain arguably the scariest material in the entire film, and could stand alone as an perfectly acceptable horror ""short.""  But there are other scenes with the same intensity, and the atmospheric horror and dread is pretty unrelenting throughout.  This film gripped me from the start, then never let up.I've never watched Seventh Heaven, but was very impressed with the young man who plays the lead in this movie.  He has an undeniable likeability and charisma.  He was able to simultaneously play an earnest everyman and a tortured soul on the verge of psychosis.  In a role that required some acting chops, he was compelling, believable, and largely responsible for the success of the movie's realism in the face of bizarre and horrifically surreal circumstances.On the negative side, the film resorts to some pretty cheesy CGI for the climax, ala something you'd see in a Nintendo 64 version of Resident Evil.  It's too bad, because it could have been so much more effective with some old school effects.  As it is, though, the final sequence doesn't live up to the promise of what came earlier.Even so, I enjoyed the movie, and will definitely watch it again.

Everything seemed to be just a copy of scenes from the beginnings of ""They"" and ""Darkness Falls"" but shortly after the familiar opening, things start to branch out until the movie is treading its own path.  The basic premise is familiar but classic, the kind of thing that can work a lot more than once if it's done well: a man (Barry Watson) returns to his now deserted childhood home to try to put his mind to rest once and for all whether the frightful, ghostly things he saw there as a child were real or imaginary.  Along the way, he reconnects with his childhood sweetheart (Emily Deschanel, who gives arguably the best performance in the movie, although child actress Skye McCole Bartusiak gives a standout showing too) who he doesn't really want to be attracted to because he has a girlfriend back in the city (Tory Mussett).I liken this movie to ""The Blair Witch Project"" in that I don't think it showed even a small fraction of the total story, that perhaps there's something beyond comprehension here.  It's been complained that the Boogeyman, when revealed, seemed too generic.  I don't believe we - or the characters in the movie - saw the true form of this being.  I believe that what the characters saw was the form he decided to let them see - after a mindwarping and seemingly time-bending ride of terror.  There are a couple of other points I'd like to make, and I'm going to avoid specifics where possible - and this is just my interpretation anyway - but I'm going to put it down below.WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEADA lot of people say this movie makes no sense.  One of the reasons for that, I would imagine, is the relatively easy (after initially seeming unbeatable) and quite convenient way the Boogeyman is defeated at the end.  I agree it was too easy.  Far too easy, far too convenient, and I think that's what was brilliant because I think it's exactly the way this entity, this Boogeyman, planned for it to all go down.  I'm not just making excuses because I liked the movie and want to explain away a bad ending, but the only way it makes sense is if that's the way he wanted it.  I think it was all some elaborate lure/game that this Boogeyman or whatever his/its real name is set up as a means of increasing his own power even further.  And I think he needed this particular person (Watson's character) to, for whatever reason, use that particular item, for this play to work.  If this is true, his victims are more than his victims - they are(at least some of them) pawns on a chess board.I personally want there to be a sequel to this, although if I'm on the right track here it would be dangerous to try,because it would be easy to blow it big time if they actualy try and show what's behind the facade and the games.  But if done right, it could be one of the greatest movies ever.  It may be that it can't be explained.  Some of the most effective horrors are those that, like the first Blair Witch and certain of H.P. Lovecraft's stories, suggest that the 'explanation' behind a series of events may be so alien to anything we've ever experienced or imagined that we could never grasp it.  Maybe that's why the Boogeyman tends to haunt children, because being more open-minded and innocent, they're the closest anyone could ever get to understanding what he is, and that's a secret he doesn't want out there.  Maybe this is a Boogeyman who's responsible for a lot more than we'd ever know, and the only rumors of hs or its existance are from when he's manifested to pursue potential threats to his reign.  Those last couple of thoughts are pure conjecture, but the rest of it, I really belive was the point of the movie.  And I don't know if anything's going to be able to stop him for real if there is a sequel, but I think Franny Roberts (Bartusiak's character) may have at least part of the key, whether she knows it or not.Deep, scary stuff.",4,Way More Than Meets The Eye,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,3998,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'Boogeyman', 'thought', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Everything', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'copy', 'scenes', 'beginnings', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'shortly', 'familiar', 'opening', 'things', 'start', 'branch', 'out', 'movie', 'treading', 'own', 'path', 'basic', 'premise', 'familiar', 'classic', 'kind', 'thing', 'can', 'work', 'lot', 'more', 'once', 'done', 'well', 'man', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'now', 'deserted', 'childhood', 'home', 'try', 'put', 'mind', 'rest', 'once', 'frightful', 'ghostly', 'things', 'saw', 'there', 'child', 'were', 'real', 'imaginary', 'way', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'who', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'movie', 'child', 'actress', 'Skye', 'McCole', 'Bartusiak', 'standout', 'showing', 'too', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'be', 'attracted', 'girlfriend', 'back', 'city', 'Tory', 'Mussett', '.I', 'liken', 'movie', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'showed', 'even', 'small', 'fraction', 'total', 'story', 'perhaps', 'something', 'comprehension', 'here', 'been', 'complained', 'Boogeyman', 'when', 'revealed', 'seemed', 'too', 'generic', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'characters', 'movie', 'saw', 'true', 'form', 'being', 'believe', 'what', 'characters', 'saw', 'was', 'form', 'decided', 'let', 'see', 'mindwarping', 'seemingly', 'time-bending', 'ride', 'terror', 'are', 'couple', 'other', 'points', ""'d"", 'like', 'make', ""'m"", 'going', 'avoid', 'specifics', 'where', 'possible', 'just', 'interpretation', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'going', 'put', 'down', 'below.WARNING', 'POSSIBLE', 'SEMI-SPOILERS', 'AHEADA', 'lot', 'people', 'say', 'movie', 'sense', 'One', 'reasons', 'would', 'imagine', 'relatively', 'easy', 'initially', 'seeming', 'unbeatable', 'quite', 'convenient', 'way', 'Boogeyman', 'defeated', 'end', 'agree', 'was', 'too', 'easy', 'Far', 'too', 'easy', 'far', 'too', 'convenient', 'think', 'what', 'was', 'brilliant', 'think', 'exactly', 'way', 'entity', 'Boogeyman', 'planned', 'go', 'down', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'making', 'excuses', 'liked', 'movie', 'want', 'explain', 'away', 'bad', 'ending', 'only', 'way', 'sense', 'way', 'wanted', 'think', 'was', 'elaborate', 'lure/game', 'Boogeyman', 'his/its', 'real', 'name', 'set', 'up', 'means', 'increasing', 'own', 'power', 'even', 'further', 'think', 'needed', 'particular', 'person', 'Watson', 'character', 'reason', 'use', 'particular', 'item', 'play', 'work', 'true', 'victims', 'are', 'more', 'victims', 'are', 'least', 'pawns', 'chess', 'board.I', 'personally', 'want', 'be', 'sequel', ""'m"", 'right', 'track', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'dangerous', 'try', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'blow', 'big', 'time', 'actualy', 'try', 'show', 'what', 'facade', 'games', 'done', 'right', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'may', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'explained', 'most', 'effective', 'horrors', 'are', 'first', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'certain', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'stories', 'suggest', ""'explanation"", 'series', 'events', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'alien', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'experienced', 'imagined', 'could', 'never', 'grasp', 'Maybe', 'why', 'Boogeyman', 'haunt', 'children', 'being', 'more', 'open-minded', 'innocent', ""'re"", 'closest', 'anyone', 'could', 'ever', 'get', 'understanding', 'what', 'secret', ""n't"", 'want', 'out', 'there', 'Maybe', 'Boogeyman', 'who', 'responsible', 'lot', 'more', ""'d"", 'ever', 'know', 'only', 'rumors', 'hs', 'existance', 'are', 'when', 'manifested', 'pursue', 'potential', 'threats', 'reign', 'last', 'couple', 'thoughts', 'are', 'pure', 'conjecture', 'rest', 'really', 'belive', 'was', 'point', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'real', 'sequel', 'think', 'Franny', 'Roberts', 'Bartusiak', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'least', 'part', 'key', 'not.Deep', 'scary', 'stuff']",Boogeyman
896216,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B0007Z2556,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[7, 8]","There is nothing great in this film except for very clever camera angles which are appropriately disorienting and quick flashy editing a la ""The Grudge"" and ""The Ring"" (which are far superior horror flicks).  However, I found myself enjoying this little film nevertheless because of the smaller elements within the film.It is a simple tale and much of the specifics are already given in Amazon's review/synopsis and the product descriptor.  I want to focus here on what I liked about the film.  This is a rather low-budget flick and that can often be a good thing as it forces the director and writers to be clever with little money.  I already mentioned that the photography and editing are excellent, but so is the cinematography, which deals more with color, shades, and the like.  It is truly nightmarish.  The film's 88 minutes leave little room for tangents that don't play a part in the story and this causes the story to unfold at a suspenseful, but fast clip.The principal actors are all rather familar and are quite convincing in their roles.  Barry Watson of ""7th Heaven"" fame is the grown up kid who witnessed the Boogeyman take his dad.  Lucy Lawless of ""Xena"" is in this film all too briefly, but is terrifying as the dying mom sending a last message to her son.  Lastly, Emily Deschanel of the current hit ""Bones"" lends wonderful support as the childhood ""girlfriend"" from the past who still cares about our hero.I found this film to be an effective little chiller.  It's not one of my favorites and I can easily understand the negative reviews on here regarding this film, but, nevertheless, I did enjoy it.  It plays well at home on a rainy night and it's a pleasant and spooky diversion from the more blood and gore, gratuitous sex and nudity, and paint-by-numbers slasher films that we've been hammered with lately and in the past.  In comparison to those, this film is quite original and tame, but fun just the same.I like a horror film that I can actually watch with my kids who are 10 and 14.  They weren't terribly frightened by this film, but they enjoyed the spooky qualities within it.

896218,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0007Z2556,Terry Mesnard,"[1, 6]","So far this year we have seen some mediocre horror movies (Hide and Seek) and some bad horror movies (Alone in the Dark).  Boogeyman, in my opinion, is in the inbetween area between ugh and meh.  Not a very good place to be.This is yet another pre-teen ""fight fest"" that lacks subtley and true horror and is intent with using ""jump out"" scares that are heightened by a piercing musical cue.  It's a very typical horror movie that is filled with horror movie cliches that were tired back in the 90s.  The hero runs into something, big boom of music to wake up the audience. Hero runs into something else, another big boom of music. I'm just tired of this kind of thrill. It's overdone.The story reminded me a lot of the set up to Darkness Falls with the Boogeyman replacing the Tooth Fairy. Usually I'm at odds with professional reviewers when they reveiw horror movies. You can usually tell, however, what kind of quality movie is being put out by whether the production company will have an advanced showing before releasing to theatres.  This movie (like Alone in the Dark before it) was not released for pre-reviews.  That is usually an indicator of a special kind of crap fest.The problem with this movie is that it's just not very scary unless you are or are with a 12 year old and I hate to say it, but a 12 year old female.  It's very telling, though, when at the climax of the film 2 of my female friends and I laughed because we were watching a reject from the Mummy Returns getting attacked by Barry Watson.  What went wrong?There are times when you feel like they are trying to be smart and trying to move the story above the cliche, but they never fully manage it. I think the best and most startling part of the movie involves the hallucination early on where the main character sees his mother. What disappoints me most about the movie is that they have a rich world to work with. The main character's past is filled with traumatic experiences involving psuedo child abuse. If the movie had strayed closer to this and the main character's past coming back to haunt him instead of the ""real boogeyman"", I think it would have been more successful and ultimately scary.The trailer was very good and made me very interested in it. It looked like a head trip and I thought it might go down the territory of the boogeyman being a metaphor and not a ""real"" computer generated monster. Horror movies are most successful when they delve into the human psyche and truly examine fear. We never delve into the main character's mind, never truly see the dark past that brought him to where he was. All we ultimately see is a reject from the Mummy Returns. It's sad because I really wanted to like this movie. Especially coming off of The Grudge, I expected a certain something from Sam Raimi's new production company. I got ""something"" alright but it wasn't what I was looking for.2 stars = don't bother buying; highly against wasting the money for a renter, see it on TV if you have nothing better to do.",2,Stuck between ugh and meh,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,3006,"['So', 'far', 'year', 'have', 'seen', 'mediocre', 'horror', 'movies', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'bad', 'horror', 'movies', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'Boogeyman', 'opinion', 'inbetween', 'area', 'ugh', 'meh', 'Not', 'very', 'good', 'place', 'be.This', 'yet', 'pre-teen', 'fight', 'fest', 'subtley', 'true', 'horror', 'intent', 'using', 'jump', 'out', 'scares', 'are', 'heightened', 'piercing', 'musical', 'cue', 'very', 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'filled', 'horror', 'movie', 'cliches', 'were', 'tired', 'back', '90s', 'hero', 'something', 'big', 'boom', 'music', 'wake', 'up', 'audience', 'Hero', 'something', 'else', 'big', 'boom', 'music', ""'m"", 'just', 'tired', 'kind', 'thrill', 'overdone.The', 'story', 'reminded', 'lot', 'set', 'up', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'Boogeyman', 'replacing', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Usually', ""'m"", 'odds', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'when', 'reveiw', 'horror', 'movies', 'can', 'usually', 'tell', 'however', 'what', 'kind', 'quality', 'movie', 'being', 'put', 'out', 'production', 'company', 'will', 'have', 'advanced', 'showing', 'releasing', 'theatres', 'movie', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'pre-reviews', 'usually', 'indicator', 'special', 'kind', 'crap', 'fest.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'scary', 'are', 'are', '12', 'year', 'old', 'hate', 'say', '12', 'year', 'old', 'female', 'very', 'telling', 'though', 'when', 'climax', 'film', '2', 'female', 'friends', 'laughed', 'were', 'watching', 'reject', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'getting', 'attacked', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'What', 'went', 'wrong', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'feel', 'are', 'trying', 'be', 'smart', 'trying', 'move', 'story', 'cliche', 'never', 'fully', 'manage', 'think', 'best', 'most', 'startling', 'part', 'movie', 'hallucination', 'early', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'mother', 'What', 'most', 'movie', 'have', 'rich', 'world', 'work', 'main', 'character', 'past', 'filled', 'traumatic', 'experiences', 'involving', 'psuedo', 'child', 'abuse', 'movie', 'had', 'strayed', 'closer', 'main', 'character', 'past', 'coming', 'back', 'haunt', 'instead', 'real', 'boogeyman', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'ultimately', 'scary.The', 'trailer', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'made', 'very', 'interested', 'looked', 'head', 'trip', 'thought', 'might', 'go', 'down', 'territory', 'boogeyman', 'being', 'metaphor', 'not', 'real', 'computer', 'generated', 'monster', 'Horror', 'movies', 'are', 'most', 'successful', 'when', 'delve', 'human', 'psyche', 'truly', 'examine', 'fear', 'never', 'delve', 'main', 'character', 'mind', 'never', 'truly', 'see', 'dark', 'brought', 'where', 'was', 'ultimately', 'see', 'reject', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'sad', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'Especially', 'coming', 'Grudge', 'expected', 'certain', 'something', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'new', 'production', 'company', 'got', 'something', 'alright', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'for.2', 'stars', '=', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'buying', 'highly', 'wasting', 'money', 'renter', 'see', 'TV', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do']",Boogeyman

896225,A1F6Q5Q0U6MS5X,B0007Z2556,Tim F. Martin,"[4, 4]","I really wanted to like _Boogeyman_, I did, I have grown to love the PG-13 and R supernatural horror films, films that feature some supernatural entity as the villain, are set in the modern day, real world with real people, have a suitably creepy atmosphere enhanced by great mood music, excellent cinematography, maybe a little humor, and have little if any gore, just good thrills and mood, movies like _The Ring_, and _The Grudge_.Alas, I was to be disappointed with _Boogeyman_.It wasn't awful, don't get me wrong, at no point did I want to stop watching it, I just feel disappointed.Ok, the basic premise. It opened pretty strongly, a young boy, the main character as a child, is having a hard time falling asleep one night. He sees in the half-light of his room everything as being sinister...the clothes crumpled together in chair, an action figure on his nightstand, they are all monsters, revealed as mundane objects when the boy switches the light on, but then something else becomes a monster. Soon enough though a real monster makes its presence known. The commotion that that causes soon summons the boy's father to the room, who with amusement and love confidently sets about to debunk his youngster's fears. Unfortunately there really is an (unglimpsed) monster in the room, one that sucks his father through the closet, never to be seen again.We fast forward to the future, where the main character, Tim, played by Barry Watson, is an editor (for a magazine?). He apparently had a rough child hood and is still seeing a psychologist for his fears (the same one it turns out since he was a little boy). He is afraid of dark places and closets, and I liked how when we go to his apartment it is all white, light, no dark paneling, no dark corners, all the doors from all the cabinets have been removed. He has a very attractive and apparently quite understanding girlfriend and seems to have a good life, far, far from home.Unfortunately events call him back to home with the funeral of his mother. The house he grew up in, the one his father vanished in, is his. He (foolishly!) decides to spend the night in it, visited a few times by his childhood friend Kate (played by Emily Deschanel, who was interesting to see playing a character so obviously unlike Bones in the TV show _Bones_).That's about as good as it gets. Interesting premise, good cast, some good mood and atmosphere...but that's it. They went to the well one too many times with the whole being scared of something that turns out to be just a coat hanger or door or what not, its silhouette in the dark taking on a threatening appearance. However, that to me wasn't really one of the Big Problems with the movie.First of all, some spoilers ahead, it becomes clear that you can only be hurt by the monster if you believe in him. No, wait, correct that. He won't hurt you, just your friends and family. What? They don't believe in him, they might not have even heard of him or know much about your belief (or be completely uninformed) but they can be hurt while you can't be more than just scared silly once in a while? And at what point does the monster come after someone? Why these people in his life at this time? Was it because the monster, this boogeyman, was fresh in his mind, or that he was close to or in that house? Why not before?Second, the monster can travel through closets from place to place. That's cool, that's fine, its been done but is not a bad plot device for a creature of this kind. Not a problem. Well, it seems when following the monster or its victims, Tim travels through space as well, going in a closet in one part of the world and ending up somewhere else. How is this possible? That is never explained. Would have been neat to show maybe some extradimensonal space that he entered perhaps, or that Tim had acquired powers by his connection with the creature, something, but it is never explained.Third, there is a whole subplot with the ghosts of children that were victims that I won't get into, but it didn't make much sense and I don't think ever got any adequate payoff or closure. I will say if those kids were victims of the monster, than why didn't Tim as a child join them? It was his father that the monster took, not him.Fourth, the final fate of some of the victims was unclear, I won't go into that either, too much spoiler age, but it is never made clear at all where they went and what happened to them.Finally, fifth, the monster, when finally shown at the end, was rendered with absolutely awful CGI. Just terrible.I would say skip this one. If want to be some sort of completist maybe, or if you really like Emily Deschanel, but otherwise I say give this a pass.",2,Ultimately disappointing,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,4691,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', '_Boogeyman_', 'did', 'have', 'grown', 'love', 'PG-13', 'R', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'films', 'films', 'feature', 'supernatural', 'entity', 'villain', 'are', 'set', 'modern', 'day', 'real', 'world', 'real', 'people', 'have', 'suitably', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'enhanced', 'great', 'mood', 'music', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'maybe', 'little', 'humor', 'have', 'little', 'gore', 'just', 'good', 'thrills', 'mood', 'movies', '_The', 'Ring_', '_The', 'Grudge_.Alas', 'was', 'be', 'disappointed', '_Boogeyman_.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'awful', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'point', 'did', 'want', 'stop', 'watching', 'just', 'feel', 'disappointed.Ok', 'basic', 'premise', 'opened', 'pretty', 'strongly', 'young', 'boy', 'main', 'character', 'child', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'falling', 'asleep', 'one', 'night', 'half-light', 'room', 'everything', 'being', 'sinister', 'clothes', 'crumpled', 'together', 'chair', 'action', 'figure', 'nightstand', 'are', 'monsters', 'revealed', 'mundane', 'objects', 'when', 'boy', 'light', 'then', 'something', 'else', 'monster', 'Soon', 'enough', 'real', 'monster', 'presence', 'known', 'commotion', 'soon', 'summons', 'boy', 'father', 'room', 'who', 'amusement', 'love', 'confidently', 'debunk', 'youngster', 'fears', 'Unfortunately', 'really', 'unglimpsed', 'monster', 'room', 'one', 'father', 'closet', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again.We', 'fast', 'forward', 'future', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'Tim', 'played', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'editor', 'magazine', 'apparently', 'had', 'rough', 'child', 'hood', 'still', 'seeing', 'psychologist', 'fears', 'same', 'one', 'out', 'was', 'little', 'boy', 'afraid', 'dark', 'places', 'closets', 'liked', 'how', 'when', 'go', 'apartment', 'white', 'light', 'dark', 'paneling', 'dark', 'corners', 'doors', 'cabinets', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'very', 'attractive', 'apparently', 'quite', 'understanding', 'girlfriend', 'have', 'good', 'life', 'far', 'far', 'home.Unfortunately', 'events', 'call', 'back', 'home', 'funeral', 'mother', 'house', 'grew', 'up', 'one', 'father', 'vanished', 'foolishly', 'spend', 'night', 'visited', 'few', 'times', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Kate', 'played', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'who', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'playing', 'character', 'so', 'obviously', 'Bones', 'TV', 'show', '_Bones_', '.That', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'Interesting', 'premise', 'good', 'cast', 'good', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'went', 'well', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'whole', 'being', 'scared', 'something', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'coat', 'hanger', 'door', 'what', 'not', 'silhouette', 'dark', 'taking', 'threatening', 'appearance', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'one', 'Big', 'Problems', 'movie.First', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'clear', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'hurt', 'monster', 'believe', 'No', 'wait', 'correct', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'just', 'friends', 'family', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'even', 'heard', 'know', 'much', 'belief', 'be', 'completely', 'uninformed', 'can', 'be', 'hurt', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'just', 'scared', 'silly', 'once', 'while', 'what', 'point', 'monster', 'come', 'someone', 'Why', 'people', 'life', 'time', 'Was', 'monster', 'boogeyman', 'was', 'fresh', 'mind', 'was', 'close', 'house', 'Why', 'not', 'before', 'Second', 'monster', 'can', 'travel', 'closets', 'place', 'place', 'cool', 'fine', 'been', 'done', 'not', 'bad', 'plot', 'device', 'creature', 'kind', 'Not', 'problem', 'Well', 'when', 'following', 'monster', 'victims', 'Tim', 'through', 'space', 'as', 'well', 'going', 'closet', 'one', 'part', 'world', 'ending', 'up', 'somewhere', 'else', 'How', 'possible', 'never', 'explained', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'neat', 'show', 'maybe', 'extradimensonal', 'space', 'entered', 'perhaps', 'Tim', 'had', 'acquired', 'powers', 'connection', 'creature', 'something', 'never', 'explained.Third', 'whole', 'subplot', 'ghosts', 'children', 'were', 'victims', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'got', 'adequate', 'payoff', 'closure', 'will', 'say', 'kids', 'were', 'victims', 'monster', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Tim', 'child', 'join', 'was', 'father', 'monster', 'took', 'not', 'him.Fourth', 'final', 'fate', 'victims', 'was', 'unclear', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'spoiler', 'age', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'where', 'went', 'what', 'happened', 'them.Finally', 'fifth', 'monster', 'when', 'finally', 'shown', 'end', 'was', 'rendered', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'CGI', 'Just', 'terrible.I', 'would', 'say', 'skip', 'one', 'want', 'be', 'sort', 'completist', 'maybe', 'really', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'otherwise', 'say', 'give', 'pass']",Boogeyman
896226,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0007Z2556,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","Boogeyman opens with a young boy up in his room.  He's terrified of something in the dark.  He dives under his covers to hide only to see a menacing figured hovering over him, it's then that a parent comes into the room to assure him that everything is ok..until the parent is attacked and killed by the apparition.  Now cut ahead 15 years, the boy is now a young man in his early 20's and terrified of the dark, particularly dark places with doors like closets.  Sound familiar?  Maybe because it's basically the same opening as the also bad (but better than this) horror film of a few years ago called Darkness Falls.  That film dealt with one childhood myth of the toothfairy while Boogeyman deals with...uhhh...the boogeyman.Barry Watson plays Tim, now grown up and possessed by this unnatural fear.  Upon learning of his mother's death he decides to return home and spend a night in the house of his youth and where his father was taken.  Most assume that Tim is just a bit deranged and they're a bit right as he regularly freaks out when when he finds himself trapped in tight quarters.  He creeps around the old house hearing the sounds of various doors creeking open or closed as the director opts for the usual, cheap jump in your seat moments as things go dashing by the doorway, just out of sight.We learn that as a child Tim's father locked him in a closet and scared him of tales of the boogeyman in order so he WOULDN'T be afraid.  A psychologist would have a field day with that.  Tim's mom is played by Lucy Lawless in a near cameo role.  No horror movie these days is complete without a creepy little kid and this one is no different as Tim meets a little girl named Franny who hangs around Tim's old house at all hours of the night.  He finds her book bag loaded with pictures of missing kids and soon learns that Franny's father was taken by the Boogeyman...then we learn what anyone with an IQ over 10 already knew...that Franny was a ghost and one of the missing kids, apparently taken by the Boogeyman as well.  One immediately wonders why Franny was able to appear to Tim and not any of the other kids or his father.  That MIGHT have helped!  Tim eventually has to have a showdown in his own room with the spirit and is joined by childhood friend Kate.  When we finally get a good look at the Thing we get a very cheap CGI affect.Boogeyman is front and center of what is wrong with so many horror films today.  No originality...almost no story whatsover..just a series of startling moments that don't make a story.  What was this boogeyman?  Beats the heck out of me...evidently it did with the writer and director since they offered no explanation of their own.

896228,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007Z2556,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 4]","I recently noticed that many reviewers have already posted negative reviews on this page. I should have visited here long before, at least before watching this terrible film in the empty theater in Japan (where they released it theatrically in June, 2006). Yes, you are right, folks. The film is horrible. The sole merit of `Boogeyman' is its atmospheric photography, and in this film the atmospheric photography means a dilapidated house where some evil force lurks somewhere behind the door. and nothing more.The rest of the `Boogeyman' is about how to make a horror film out of clich&#65533;d techniques and unbelievably stupid behaviors of the characters. But to be fair, the story itself is not without merit. Barry Watson plays one young non-descript guy Tim, whose father is, he believes, killed by the `Boogeyman' hiding in the closet when he was a little boy. Now, though nobody believes him, Tim thinks the evil monster comes back, hiding again somewhere in his old house, but is he really sane? Or he could be simply clinging to the delusion.When the film needs subtle direction, director Stephen T. Kay insists on fast cuts and loud noise, overusing the flashy camera works. You will surely jump in the seat a few times because he uses the hackneyed technique to scare people -- some big loud sound that jolts you out of sleep. In fact, we need the jolt because the film, lacking the ability to build up the suspense, is pretty sleep-inducing.As to the stupidity of the characters, it is just beyond belief. They are so willing to risk their lives, like one lady entering someone else's house at night without permission, calling `Tim? Where are you?' Usually we leave and come back tomorrow, don't we? Anyway, Barry Watson is not the right choice for the film, whose character just cannot engage our attention, and nor is the `Boogeyman' itself with the terrible CGI.The film comes from Ghost House Pictures (which gave us disappointing `The Grudge'), produced by Sam Raimi.

Even renting this film is a waste of time. Had they attempted to explain the entire thing with Tim being a schizophrenic who flipped out and killed everyone, but hallucinated the boogeyman doing it, then that would've probably saved the film, but it didn't end that way.Tim is the typical screwed up, scared of the closet kid, only about twenty years too old, being traumatized by having seen his father get mangled in the closet by the boogeyman. After posing for the first twenty minutes as having rewritten this event into just a way of dealing with his father's leaving (not very convincing, by the way), he goes home after his mother's death and decides to face his old fears by spending a night in the house he grew up in. Then follows a group of messily edited, badly written, and confusing events that make no sense and are not even remotely explained.For no apparent reason, he drags along for about an hour an old childhood friend named Kate, who conveniently keeps showing up with only flimsy contrived excuses.  She rides over to his house on a horse which for no reason throws her off; he has no food so she rides her bike late at night over to bring him some.None of this would be that bad if it wasn't for the fact that the last fifteen minutes were a series of absurd events. His excessively touchy-feely girlfriend shows up, drives him to a motel, and vanishes. He goes into a closet and comes out in his old house's closet and jumps at Kate (there to give the gift of food). He goes and chats with a girl, who was following him around asking about the boogeyman who then was dead but still showing up, being a kind of spiritual advisor on destroying childhood demons. He goes into closets and appears in different buildings, sometimes under beds, gets pulled under beds and comes out closets, and something about nailing a chair in front of a closet and facing the boogeyman turns into him smashing and destroying everything in his old room as a means of destroying the boogeyman. It would have been all okay had it been the delusions of a madman, with his sudden appearances elsewhere being blackouts and flashes of memory. But no, it was supposed to be a real, non-CGI boogeyman. The result was a cheesy, boring, 90 minute film that should've ended way sooner, because even at a hour and a half, it went too long. It could've been good if it had just not tried to make the whole boogeyman thing a literal thing, but of course, they didn't.And what was that with his girlfriend? He walks through a closet and finds himself in the motel bathroom where she vanished, sees gray water pouring out of the faucet, then she pops out of the water a few times to be apparently drowned or at least repeatedly covered with splashing dirty water by some watery manifestation of, yes, the boogeyman. Then he goes to his room, with the ever present Kate, smashed a few toys, and everything was peachy.I've watched horror movies since about the age of six, a good eleven years, from Nightmare on Elm St., to the Hammer films, to Dracula (about forty of them), to Evil Dead, and this one just sucks.

896232,A38N7SFDOB3MR3,B0007Z2556,Wisconsin Dad,"[1, 1]","I enjoyed the Boogeyman. I have never heard of the flick before viewing it, and expected it to have the same old cookie cutter slasher elements in it. What I found was that it was devoid of cliches, devoid of gore and violence, high of chills and frights, and a darn good film.Barry Watson plays Tim, a man who is deathly afraid of the Boogeyman. The Boogeyman is a evil force of some sort that lives in closets. Tim is forced to return home, where he faces old memories and the Boogeyman.Overall, there was much to like about the film. The acting was great. Barry Watson did a wonderful job, and the cast around him was great as well. The story was fresh, and completely devoid of every horror movie cliche. This alone makes it worth watching.The Boogeyman also didn't have the 200 gallons of blood and endless gore that seems to be clogging film these days. Director Stephen Kay and Writer Eric Kripke remember that frights scare people, not mass quantities of severed body parts and gallons of blood. The Boogeyman was scary because of the story, and not because of severed limbs.While liking the film, I do have a couple of things I didn't care about it. First, the Boogeyman, when seen, looked very CGI and amateurish. It was more terrifying before we got to see the Boogeyman. Secondly, there were a few plot points that were left untied. The movie didn't have enough closure for me.Lastly, the Boogeyman could have been a great film, but ended up being only very good. With a great combo of acting, writing and pacing, the stories had all the elements to be the best horror movie I have seen all year. But alas, something was missing. For me, I think the missing element was how the ending was handled. The pacing up until the last 30 minutes was suspenseful, but once the Boogeyman reared its head, the movie almost seemed to move too fast, lose its frightening characteristics, and become another film.The Boogeyman is a movie that I would highly recommend to fans of horror who want a refreshing change, or for couples looking for a good scare without violence and blood. Its not so great that I would buy it, but good enough where it is a must see.Total Score (out of 100) = 7137 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.9 (out of 10).

It didn't look that great, but I always liked the folkloric ""boogeyman"" character and I figured if nothing else it would be worth some cheap thrills and a bit of fun.  I was wrong.""Boogeyman"" is one of the most disjointed, obtuse and utterly unenjoyable flicks I have seen for a long time.  The first few minutes are so predictable it is almost like a parody of better horror films, and then things just get worse. Bad (or non-existent) plot.  Bad acting. Bad CGI monster that looks like it was recycled fromThe Mummy.  Just bad in general.The main character, Barry Watson, thinks acting consists of trying to strike the most brooding pose possible.  He plays the male in possibly the most uninteresting love-triangle put to film, with his gorgeous, rich, caring girlfriend (Tory Mussett) on one side, and his plain-jane tomboy childhood sweetheart (Zooey Deschanel's sister Emily Deschanel) on the other.  There is no real conflict here, and the gals just appear and disappear as the plot calls for it, moon a bit over our brooding hero, and then...exit the stage when their cue is called.  Oh, and of course there is a pre-requisite ""spooky little kid"" character (Skye McCole Bartusiak), and if you can't figure out her story about five minutes following her appearance than you haven't been watching any horror films for the past 10 years.  Even if you slog through the whole flick, there is no resolution.  Is the boogeyman real or not?  Did certain characters die or not?  What exactly is going on?  You will never know...This DVD comes with a few extra features, including an interview with the director, Stephen T. Kay.  I was almost more interested in this than the movie, because I was curious as to how he could justify the train-wreck he made.  I was even more annoyed when I heard him talking about how he wanted to emulate Japanese and Korean horror movies, and that was his goal when making ""Boogeyman"".  I happen to be a fan of Asian horror flicks, and I can say that he widely missed the mark.  He scratches only the most surface areas of the genre, while ignoring all of the rich cultural mythology and depth that make the films work.  Clearly, Stephen T. Kay should stick to his role as ""Reginald Jennings"" on the soap opera General Hospital, and stay away from the back of a movie camera.  Based on this film, he is a director to avoid.The one good thing that I have to say about ""Boogeyman"" is that it is beautifully photographed, and both props and sympathies go to the cinematographer, whose talents where fully wasted on this amateur-hour production.",1,Should have read the reviews,1223856000,"10 13, 2008",2008,2678,"['rented', 'one', 'whim', 'having', 'heard', 'nothing', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'cast', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'great', 'always', 'liked', 'folkloric', 'boogeyman', 'character', 'figured', 'nothing', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'bit', 'fun', 'was', 'wrong', 'Boogeyman', 'one', 'most', 'disjointed', 'obtuse', 'utterly', 'unenjoyable', 'flicks', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'are', 'so', 'predictable', 'almost', 'parody', 'better', 'horror', 'films', 'then', 'things', 'just', 'get', 'worse', 'Bad', 'non-existent', 'plot', 'Bad', 'acting', 'Bad', 'CGI', 'monster', 'was', 'recycled', 'fromThe', 'Mummy', 'Just', 'bad', 'general.The', 'main', 'character', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'acting', 'consists', 'trying', 'strike', 'most', 'brooding', 'pose', 'possible', 'male', 'possibly', 'most', 'uninteresting', 'love-triangle', 'put', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'rich', 'caring', 'girlfriend', 'Tory', 'Mussett', 'one', 'side', 'plain-jane', 'tomboy', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'sister', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'other', 'real', 'conflict', 'here', 'gals', 'just', 'appear', 'disappear', 'plot', 'bit', 'brooding', 'hero', 'then', 'stage', 'when', 'cue', 'called', 'Oh', 'course', 'pre-requisite', 'spooky', 'little', 'kid', 'character', 'Skye', 'McCole', 'Bartusiak', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'story', 'five', 'minutes', 'following', 'appearance', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'watching', 'horror', 'films', 'past', '10', 'years', 'Even', 'slog', 'whole', 'flick', 'resolution', 'boogeyman', 'real', 'not', 'Did', 'certain', 'characters', 'die', 'not', 'What', 'exactly', 'going', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'DVD', 'few', 'extra', 'features', 'including', 'interview', 'director', 'Stephen', 'T.', 'Kay', 'was', 'almost', 'more', 'interested', 'movie', 'was', 'curious', 'how', 'could', 'justify', 'train-wreck', 'made', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'annoyed', 'when', 'heard', 'talking', 'how', 'wanted', 'emulate', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'horror', 'movies', 'was', 'goal', 'when', 'making', 'Boogeyman', 'happen', 'be', 'fan', 'Asian', 'horror', 'flicks', 'can', 'say', 'widely', 'missed', 'mark', 'only', 'most', 'surface', 'areas', 'genre', 'ignoring', 'rich', 'cultural', 'mythology', 'depth', 'make', 'films', 'work', 'Clearly', 'Stephen', 'T.', 'Kay', 'should', 'stick', 'role', 'Reginald', 'Jennings', 'soap', 'opera', 'General', 'Hospital', 'stay', 'away', 'back', 'movie', 'camera', 'Based', 'film', 'director', 'avoid.The', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'Boogeyman', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'props', 'sympathies', 'go', 'cinematographer', 'talents', 'where', 'fully', 'wasted', 'amateur-hour', 'production']",Boogeyman
