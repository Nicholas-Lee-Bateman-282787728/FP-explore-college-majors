1648536,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00CKZE7FC,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[7, 7]","Mark, a shy high school freshman with mild Asperger's Syndrome, was very close to his super-popular older brother, Chaz, to whom he felt much closer than his parents, who were somewhat emotionally distant from him.  When Chaz gets killed in an auto accident, Mark has to deal not only with his own grief, but being virtually ignored by his parents, who are dealing with their own issues.  One of Chaz's friends, Doug, takes Mark under his wing, and he joins the ""study group"" (actually a weekly poker game) with Chaz's friends, including Randy, to whom Chaz was the closest.  The distraction of learning to play poker (which he does remarkably well, with great effort) gives Mark a welcome distraction, but he really relishes the times the group talks about Chaz.  When he learns that Chaz was a volunteer at a local diversity community center, Mark checks that out, eventually learning about a part of his brother's life that he never shared.Director Quentin Lee does his usual remarkable job with a challenging screenplay, and gets standout performances from a talented cast.  Mark is played by Booboo Stewart (""Twilight"") with his brother Chaz was Harry Shum Jr. (""Glee""); their parents are played by BD Wong and Joan Chen. The actor playing Doug, Tyler Posey, is a current popular heartthrob for his starring role in MTV's remake of ""Teen Wolf.""The gay aspect of the film is not evident until the latter third, which is a commendable move, in making it clear that the characters' hang-ups go way beyond homophobia. The film pushes the envelope in pointing out that educated, upper-middle income people, including racial minorities, may be so worried about ""fitting in"" that they are not as open-minded as they may believe.  ""White Frog"" made the rounds of many gay film festivals, and I was surprised not to see any awards listed, other than one at the Philadelphia Asian Film Festival.  DVD has trailer and ""making of"" featurette.  Also available On Demand on some cable systems. Not rated, but would be a light PG; recommended for ""mixed"" audiences.  I recommend it highly, and give it five stars out of five.",5,"Well written, acted story of understanding and acceptance.",1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,2115,"['Mark', 'shy', 'high', 'school', 'freshman', 'mild', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'super-popular', 'older', 'brother', 'Chaz', 'whom', 'felt', 'much', 'closer', 'parents', 'who', 'were', 'somewhat', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'When', 'Chaz', 'killed', 'auto', 'accident', 'Mark', 'deal', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'grief', 'being', 'virtually', 'ignored', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'dealing', 'own', 'issues', 'One', 'Chaz', 'friends', 'Doug', 'Mark', 'wing', 'study', 'group', 'actually', 'weekly', 'poker', 'game', 'Chaz', 'friends', 'including', 'Randy', 'whom', 'Chaz', 'was', 'closest', 'distraction', 'learning', 'play', 'poker', 'remarkably', 'well', 'great', 'effort', 'Mark', 'welcome', 'distraction', 'really', 'times', 'group', 'talks', 'Chaz', 'When', 'Chaz', 'was', 'volunteer', 'local', 'diversity', 'community', 'center', 'Mark', 'out', 'eventually', 'learning', 'part', 'brother', 'life', 'never', 'shared.Director', 'Quentin', 'Lee', 'usual', 'remarkable', 'job', 'challenging', 'screenplay', 'standout', 'performances', 'talented', 'cast', 'Mark', 'played', 'Booboo', 'Stewart', 'Twilight', 'brother', 'Chaz', 'was', 'Harry', 'Shum', 'Jr.', 'Glee', 'parents', 'are', 'played', 'BD', 'Wong', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'actor', 'playing', 'Doug', 'Tyler', 'Posey', 'current', 'popular', 'heartthrob', 'starring', 'role', 'MTV', 'remake', 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'gay', 'aspect', 'film', 'not', 'evident', 'latter', 'third', 'commendable', 'move', 'making', 'clear', 'characters', 'hang-ups', 'go', 'way', 'homophobia', 'film', 'envelope', 'pointing', 'out', 'educated', 'upper-middle', 'income', 'people', 'including', 'racial', 'minorities', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'worried', 'fitting', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'open-minded', 'may', 'believe', 'White', 'Frog', 'made', 'rounds', 'many', 'gay', 'film', 'festivals', 'was', 'surprised', 'not', 'see', 'awards', 'listed', 'other', 'one', 'Philadelphia', 'Asian', 'Film', 'Festival', 'DVD', 'trailer', 'making', 'featurette', 'Also', 'available', 'Demand', 'cable', 'systems', 'Not', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'light', 'PG', 'recommended', 'mixed', 'audiences', 'recommend', 'highly', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'five']",White Frog
1648537,A247XZV6AINK8D,B00CKZE7FC,Desert Scenario,"[2, 2]","Unless you know what White Frog means, don't assume anything about what it means or what the movie is about.  In White Frog, the two major complementary themes that run parallel eventually create an understanding for their family and hopefully the audience.  I have much admiration how the movie chose to create such a story in this manner.  It is special.  The cast is outstanding. Joan Chen is in this movie! BooBoo Stewart was amazing.This particular family is church-going, so Christianity is part of the story. However, the story did not seem preachy to me, and I hate being preached at.  I did see a subtle message how wealthy church-going folk don't always have the answers and certainly might display a gap in their behavior in contrast to the relatively poor kid Doug, a prince of a guy and not necessarily in the pews every Sunday.  At one point when Doug was looking out for Nick, the song playing in the background was ""Words that Define"" with the lyrics about the gospel of Christ. I took that as a clear message that people like Doug are what Christ had in mind, whereas regular Christians are awfully challenged at showing unconditional love.  However, Christianity is a lesser theme in the overall story.  There is a lot more going on in this movie.  Make a point of seeing this one.  It is well done and very poignant.",5,Parallel themes complement each other.,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,1335,"['know', 'what', 'White', 'Frog', 'do', ""n't"", 'assume', 'anything', 'what', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'White', 'Frog', 'two', 'major', 'complementary', 'themes', 'run', 'parallel', 'eventually', 'create', 'understanding', 'family', 'hopefully', 'audience', 'have', 'much', 'admiration', 'how', 'movie', 'chose', 'create', 'such', 'story', 'manner', 'special', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'movie', 'BooBoo', 'Stewart', 'was', 'amazing.This', 'particular', 'family', 'church-going', 'Christianity', 'part', 'story', 'However', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'preachy', 'hate', 'being', 'preached', 'did', 'see', 'subtle', 'message', 'how', 'wealthy', 'church-going', 'folk', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'answers', 'certainly', 'might', 'display', 'gap', 'behavior', 'contrast', 'relatively', 'poor', 'kid', 'Doug', 'prince', 'guy', 'not', 'necessarily', 'pews', 'Sunday', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'Doug', 'was', 'looking', 'out', 'Nick', 'song', 'playing', 'background', 'was', 'Words', 'Define', 'lyrics', 'gospel', 'Christ', 'took', 'clear', 'message', 'people', 'Doug', 'are', 'what', 'Christ', 'had', 'mind', 'regular', 'Christians', 'are', 'awfully', 'challenged', 'showing', 'unconditional', 'love', 'However', 'Christianity', 'lesser', 'theme', 'overall', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'movie', 'Make', 'point', 'seeing', 'one', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'poignant']",White Frog
1648538,A6QVW3FM7KDAV,B00CKZE7FC,Doyle K.,"[1, 5]",A lot of expense and effort to make a plastic film with mostly poor acting and ridiculous costuming and makeup.

1648542,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B00CKZE7FC,J. Martin,"[2, 8]","Most of the other online reviews of White Frog seem to have been written by teenagers who have seen more TV than movies, so I'll try to give an adult perspective, in case any other adults are thinking about buying this movie.First of all, except for two of the adults, I had never before seen or heard of any of the actors in this movie. So a statement like ""Booboo Stewart gives, by far, his best performance to date"" just leaves me puzzled. A person named Booboo has made movies before? Wow.Others who rattle off other movies or TV shows these cast members have appeared in together, or refer to a ""handsome teen idol cast"" also leave me (and probably many other adults) clueless.Second, I was not ever for even one second moved to tears while watching this movie. Not anywhere close. It is EXTREMELY sappy and manipulative - and painfully predictable. If you are eager to be swept up in shallow emotionalism - or are an adolescent who can't help it - then you may love this movie. It just made me want to pull my hair out.Finally, if this really is Booboo's ""best performance to date"", he might want to consider a different career while he's still young enough to change easily. Only very young people who have seen very little of life and the world could be impressed by his performance in this movie. He looked down and mumbled all through the movie... and THAT is supposed to be a great performance? Only in an adolescent TV universe could that be true.So I'd advise adults to look elsewhere and leave this movie to the kids, with their innocent enthusiasms and the rampant emotions that seethe just under the surface of their lives. It may be better than the TV they're used to, but as a movie it's not worth watching.",1,For very impressionable adolescents only,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,1725,"['Most', 'other', 'online', 'reviews', 'White', 'Frog', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'teenagers', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'TV', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'try', 'give', 'adult', 'perspective', 'case', 'other', 'adults', 'are', 'thinking', 'buying', 'movie.First', 'two', 'adults', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'heard', 'actors', 'movie', 'statement', 'Booboo', 'Stewart', 'far', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'just', 'puzzled', 'A', 'person', 'named', 'Booboo', 'made', 'movies', 'Wow.Others', 'who', 'rattle', 'off', 'other', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'cast', 'members', 'have', 'appeared', 'together', 'refer', 'handsome', 'teen', 'idol', 'cast', 'also', 'leave', 'probably', 'many', 'other', 'adults', 'clueless.Second', 'was', 'not', 'ever', 'even', 'one', 'second', 'moved', 'tears', 'watching', 'movie', 'Not', 'anywhere', 'close', 'EXTREMELY', 'sappy', 'manipulative', 'painfully', 'predictable', 'are', 'eager', 'be', 'swept', 'up', 'shallow', 'emotionalism', 'are', 'adolescent', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'then', 'may', 'love', 'movie', 'just', 'made', 'want', 'pull', 'hair', 'out.Finally', 'really', 'Booboo', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'different', 'career', 'still', 'young', 'enough', 'change', 'easily', 'Only', 'very', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'little', 'life', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'impressed', 'performance', 'movie', 'looked', 'down', 'mumbled', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'performance', 'Only', 'adolescent', 'TV', 'universe', 'could', 'be', 'true.So', ""'d"", 'advise', 'adults', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'leave', 'movie', 'kids', 'innocent', 'enthusiasms', 'rampant', 'emotions', 'seethe', 'just', 'surface', 'lives', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'TV', ""'re"", 'used', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'watching']",White Frog
