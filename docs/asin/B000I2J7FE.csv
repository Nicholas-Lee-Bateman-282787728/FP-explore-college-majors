1018725,A2BJAET1P9QUGZ,B000I2J7FE,Baberufus,"[0, 0]","So many bands have come along since the late 60's that people tend to forget about Cream, it seems. Jimi Hendrix set the guitar world on its ear, Eric Clapton has enjoyed a hugely successful solo career, and drum legends John Bonham, Keith Moon, and especially Neil Peart constitute the trilogy of worshipped drummers among drummers. John Entwistle, John Paul Jones, Geddy Lee, and more recently Flea and Les Claypool are the bass gods. AHEM...before all those guys (except Clapton, of course), there was CREAM...and they were indeed the cream of the crop! Sadly, Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce's individual legacies have not withstood the subsequent emergences of the aforementioned greats, at least to the degree they should have. Clapton's own career has kept his own legacy alive and well respected, but in the late 60's these three guys were IT. Picture in your mind Slash, Les Claypool and Neil Peart joining forces in a new band--whoa! Well, that's how it was when Baker, Bruce and Clapton formed Cream in 1966...If you go back and listen to Cream's live recordings, the intensity and musicianship of each of the three members still stands up to any blues rock act out there, and together as a band...they STILL can't be touched! This DVD shows how it all happened, and it's very complete...no glaring omissions of facts that I noticed. This DVD would both be a great lesson in the history of rock and also a way of allowing you to appreciate the greatest band of the late 60's! It's no secret that Cream helped set the stage for hard rock and heavy metal...but that's just one of their many influences on rock music...their music itself is also something to enjoy for ages to come!!Each of the three members were interviewed specifically for this DVD, and they spill the beans entirely...especially Ginger Baker, who STILL seems to be irritated with Jack Bruce...some of his comments are hilarious!",5,A comprehensive history of the greatest band of the late 60's!,1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,1903,"['So', 'many', 'bands', 'have', 'come', 'late', '60', 'people', 'tend', 'forget', 'Cream', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'set', 'guitar', 'world', 'ear', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'enjoyed', 'hugely', 'successful', 'solo', 'career', 'drum', 'legends', 'John', 'Bonham', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'especially', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'trilogy', 'worshipped', 'drummers', 'drummers', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'John', 'Paul', 'Jones', 'Geddy', 'Lee', 'more', 'recently', 'Flea', 'Les', 'Claypool', 'are', 'bass', 'gods', 'AHEM', 'guys', 'Clapton', 'course', 'was', 'CREAM', 'were', 'indeed', 'cream', 'crop', 'Sadly', 'Ginger', 'Baker', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'individual', 'legacies', 'have', 'not', 'withstood', 'subsequent', 'emergences', 'aforementioned', 'greats', 'least', 'degree', 'should', 'have', 'Clapton', 'own', 'career', 'kept', 'own', 'legacy', 'alive', 'well', 'respected', 'late', '60', 'three', 'guys', 'were', 'IT', 'Picture', 'mind', 'Slash', 'Les', 'Claypool', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'joining', 'forces', 'new', 'band', 'whoa', 'Well', 'how', 'was', 'when', 'Baker', 'Bruce', 'Clapton', 'formed', 'Cream', '1966', 'go', 'back', 'listen', 'Cream', 'live', 'recordings', 'intensity', 'musicianship', 'three', 'members', 'still', 'up', 'blues', 'rock', 'act', 'there', 'together', 'band', 'STILL', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'touched', 'DVD', 'how', 'happened', 'very', 'complete', 'glaring', 'omissions', 'facts', 'noticed', 'DVD', 'would', 'both', 'be', 'great', 'lesson', 'history', 'rock', 'also', 'way', 'allowing', 'appreciate', 'greatest', 'band', 'late', '60', 'secret', 'Cream', 'helped', 'set', 'stage', 'hard', 'rock', 'heavy', 'metal', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'influences', 'rock', 'music', 'music', 'also', 'something', 'enjoy', 'ages', 'come', 'three', 'members', 'were', 'interviewed', 'specifically', 'DVD', 'spill', 'beans', 'entirely', 'especially', 'Ginger', 'Baker', 'who', 'STILL', 'be', 'irritated', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'comments', 'are', 'hilarious']",N/A

For the more casual viewer, perhaps the Disraeli Gears DVD or the Cream 2005 Reunion DVD might be better options.  They both contain more footage of the band playing music.  Also, I would recommend the 4-CD collection entited ""Those Were The Days"" is a collection of every song that Cream ever recorded prior to their 1969 breakup.I play drums, and the style of music that Cream played ... a spontaneous musical conversation between three masters of their respective instruments ... is something that inspires me.  It was a perfect equilateral triangle.  Ginger Baker is my greatest inspiration among drummers.So, for ME, this in depth look at the band's history is both wonderful and painful to watch.  But while the 1960's was one of the most creative decades in musical history, the behind the scenes life of the musicians, from the Beatles to Cream, was not always what it appeared to us on the surface.  There were dues to pay.  There were arguments behind the scenes.  Only the diehard fans want to see this history in all of its raw reality.

There are quite a few stories from not only Eric, Jack and Ginger, but from close associates of theirs telling their view on the rise and abrupt end of Cream.Eric and Jack seem fairly content with their story and on their experiences being in the band but Ginger seems quite bitter towards Jack.  You never really quite know why Ginger despises Jack so much, you aren't really told what Jack did throughout their relationship that seems to irritate Ginger so much.Ginger does speak a bit on not getting credited for song-writing contributions.  Nevertheless, he is quite animated when speaking about the band.  It is sad to see his dislike of Jack.Being a guitarist myself and having sat for hours on end in my mid-teens copping Clapton licks and learning Crossroads note-for-note back in the very early seventies, I have always looked to the Cream as one of the fountains of information for learning to play blues/rock guitar.

Scant attention was made as to the gap between their break up and reunion and no mention was made of their Live LP's brought out as an afterthought nor the impact Disraeli and Wheels had on the general climate. Yes, the competition and threat of Hendrix,the lack of harmony and feelings of being ripped off by Stigwood, the dislike of Wrapping Paper, Baker's lack of $ song writing royalties etc. are talked about leaving a somewhat incomplete picture looking for some harmony but overall a fine movie. Anticipated more on the making of the albums, the anticipations of the band on their rise, how the show was actually run rather we get all these personalities that were never really in sync with each other waiting for the necessary demise.

The documentary is sprinkled with song footage throughout but no complete songs are featured.The DVD ""extras"" contain just over 25 minuets worth of vintage performances.

The other performances are black and white lip-synch telivsion broadcasts of ""Strange Brew"", ""I Feel Free"", and ""NSU.""  Video and audio quality are excellent.The CD contains a 25 minuet live show performed for Swedish Radio in 1967.  Again, audio quality is excellent, much better than the BBC CD.  These sessions are not from the BBC.  Songs on this CD are: NSU, Steppin' Out, Traintime, Toad, and I'm So Glad.The booklet contains an interesting and well written overview of the band.

1018731,A14OC67MXL92FA,B000I2J7FE,"Kindle Customer ""soul_survivor""","[41, 41]","Disc 1 of this set is an exhaustive history of Cream, from a detailed examination of the early careers of all three members, to their success and breakup, up to and including the recent reunion concerts in London and New York.  There are some very brief performance clips, but in a movie that runs close to two hours there are perhaps two minutes of music.For hard-core Cream fans, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  We learn that Ginger Baker's clashes with Jack Bruce go back to pre-Cream days, when both played with Graham Bond.  Baker gets really uncorked about this, which is refreshing in a way, as most rockumentaries are hagiographies that carefully avoid any real criticism.  Jack Bruce doesn't really respond to Baker's bitter criticism and appears to shrug it off, so it's hard to see him as the overbearing egotist that Baker accuses him of being.That gives you an idea of the level of detail covered by this film.  It's more about the personalities of the musicians than the development of the music, so it's interesting from the standpoint of behind-the-scenes ego clashes.  There's more talk about who took credit for which songs (mostly complaints from Baker) then there is about how the songs came together or how the sound developed.The ""Classic Albums"" disc ""Disraeli Gears"" is far more informative about the music, so I'd recommend buying that one first.  The musicians discuss every song in some depth, and Clapton demonstrates the blues riffs they started with and gives you an idea of how the finished song was done.There is some performance footage in the extra features section (along with another 40 minutes or so of interview clips).  Very little footage of Cream was ever filmed, and the segment here has been seen before on the out-of-print Fresh Live Cream DVD (or perhaps the so-called Farewell Concert DVD).  The camera is stuck right underneath Jack Bruce, so you mostly see him; every so often the camerman swings right to give us a glimpse of Baker and Clapton, but you can tell he's down in front and has little room to maneuver.  Again, the performance footage on ""Disrael Gears"" is much better.You also get a music video for NSU (suprisingly well done for that time), plus two German TV appearances where the band mime two songs.Disc 2 is an Audio CD with about 40 minutes' worth of previously unreleased live tracks, and this is pretty good stuff.This is a good purchase for hard-core Cream fans, but if it's the music you're interested in, rather than the personalities, I'd recommend getting the ""Disraeli Gears"" disc first.",4,Detailed Documentary (no music),1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,2567,"['Disc', '1', 'set', 'exhaustive', 'history', 'Cream', 'detailed', 'examination', 'early', 'careers', 'three', 'members', 'success', 'breakup', 'up', 'including', 'recent', 'reunion', 'concerts', 'London', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'very', 'brief', 'performance', 'clips', 'movie', 'close', 'two', 'hours', 'are', 'perhaps', 'two', 'minutes', 'music.For', 'hard-core', 'Cream', 'fans', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'learn', 'Ginger', 'Baker', 'clashes', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'go', 'back', 'pre-Cream', 'days', 'when', 'played', 'Graham', 'Bond', 'Baker', 'really', 'uncorked', 'refreshing', 'way', 'most', 'rockumentaries', 'are', 'hagiographies', 'carefully', 'avoid', 'real', 'criticism', 'Jack', 'Bruce', ""n't"", 'really', 'respond', 'Baker', 'bitter', 'criticism', 'shrug', 'off', 'hard', 'see', 'overbearing', 'egotist', 'Baker', 'being.That', 'idea', 'level', 'detail', 'covered', 'film', 'more', 'personalities', 'musicians', 'development', 'music', 'interesting', 'standpoint', 'behind-the-scenes', 'ego', 'clashes', 'more', 'talk', 'who', 'took', 'credit', 'songs', 'mostly', 'Baker', 'then', 'how', 'songs', 'came', 'together', 'how', 'sound', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'disc', 'Disraeli', 'Gears', 'far', 'more', 'informative', 'music', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'one', 'first', 'musicians', 'discuss', 'song', 'depth', 'Clapton', 'blues', 'riffs', 'started', 'idea', 'how', 'finished', 'song', 'was', 'performance', 'footage', 'extra', 'features', 'section', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'interview', 'clips', 'Very', 'little', 'footage', 'Cream', 'was', 'ever', 'filmed', 'segment', 'here', 'been', 'seen', 'out-of-print', 'Fresh', 'Live', 'Cream', 'DVD', 'perhaps', 'so-called', 'Farewell', 'Concert', 'DVD', 'camera', 'stuck', 'right', 'underneath', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'mostly', 'see', 'so', 'often', 'camerman', 'swings', 'right', 'give', 'glimpse', 'Baker', 'Clapton', 'can', 'tell', 'down', 'front', 'little', 'room', 'maneuver', 'Again', 'performance', 'footage', 'Disrael', 'Gears', 'much', 'better.You', 'also', 'get', 'music', 'video', 'NSU', 'suprisingly', 'well', 'done', 'time', 'two', 'German', 'TV', 'appearances', 'where', 'band', 'mime', 'two', 'songs.Disc', '2', 'Audio', 'CD', 'about', '40', 'minutes', 'worth', 'previously', 'unreleased', 'live', 'tracks', 'pretty', 'good', 'stuff.This', 'good', 'purchase', 'hard-core', 'Cream', 'fans', 'music', ""'re"", 'interested', 'rather', 'personalities', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'Disraeli', 'Gears', 'disc', 'first']",N/A

It's a 113 minute long movie which has interviews with all 3 members of Cream as well as their road crew, management, critics and other musicians.  They go through the whole story starting with Eric Clapton's first bands like The Yardbirds and John Mayal's Blues Breakers.  Then goes into Ginger and Jack's past saying how they use to play in jazz bands.  One thing that did turn me off about this movie was Ginger Baker.  He is extreemly negative and pissy throughout the whole movie and bitches about everything.  Jack and Eric are both a treat to hear about their times in the band and feel i've learned a lot from listning to them.  I like how the movie goes through all 4 albums and Eric saying how he thought Disreli Gears was a great album.  The movie talks about the break up of the band all the way up through the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, Royal Albert Hall and Madison Square Garden reunions.  Eric and Jack said they'd be keen on doing more but Ginger, of course, says absolutley not.  You also get to hear from their lyricist Pete Brown who I found very interesting to listen too.  My favorite bass player Chris Squire from Yes talks about his love for Cream.  This is a really great dvd to add to your collection.  However as you have probably read from previous reviewers their is very little music on this dvd.  It's mostly just a lot of talking but that din't bother me much.

He is so intent on slandering Jack Bruce that it really takes the joy out of the package.  For years, they've been best of buddies, intermittently, and then at each other's throats.  And clearly, the interviewers caught Ginger at a down moment.  His relentless negativity about Jack and about Cream and their history makes this thing a complete downer.  Jack Bruce, to his credit, keeps it all polite and interesting until the end where he says, ""Ginger is a saint!!"" while laughing.  The depth of the look at the early careeers of these three is quite laudable.  And it's interesting to get the perspective of the band members after the Madison Square Garden reunion concerts - which were not particularly good - and served as the catalyst for the break-up of the band (again).  The reunion was like the first time they were together, only on fast forward.  Also, it would be nice if someone could explain to Ginger the difference between writing a song and arranging it and playing the drum part of it.  You just have to laugh when Ginger argues that he should have gotten writing credit for the drum part in White Room.  Yeah, it's a sgnature hook into the song, but he didn't write the music and he didn't write the words.  He's just a bitter old man.  Anyway, it's a shame that their reunion ended in bitter ruins all these years later.  At least the rest of us still have the music.  And by the way, the CD included with this package is just okay.  The sound quality is pretty lousy and the performances are all right.  It's nothing I care to listen to more than once or twice.  If you don't already have the other Cream DVDs - including the Disraeli Gears one, and that other Cream history, go get those first.  They actually have performances on them and everyone is in a better mood.  The best part of this DVD is the three song performance at the Revolution Club.  That's sheer joy.",3,Baker is a wild whiny wet blanket snuffing out the spirit of Cream,1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,1960,"['DVD', 'should', 'more', 'accurately', 'be', 'called', 'Revenge', 'Baker', 'so', 'intent', 'slandering', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'really', 'joy', 'package', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'best', 'buddies', 'intermittently', 'then', 'other', 'throats', 'clearly', 'interviewers', 'caught', 'Ginger', 'down', 'moment', 'relentless', 'negativity', 'Jack', 'Cream', 'history', 'thing', 'complete', 'downer', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'credit', 'polite', 'interesting', 'end', 'where', 'Ginger', 'saint', 'laughing', 'depth', 'look', 'early', 'careeers', 'three', 'quite', 'laudable', 'interesting', 'get', 'perspective', 'band', 'members', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'reunion', 'concerts', 'were', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'served', 'catalyst', 'break-up', 'band', 'again', 'reunion', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'were', 'together', 'only', 'fast', 'forward', 'Also', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'someone', 'could', 'explain', 'Ginger', 'difference', 'writing', 'song', 'arranging', 'playing', 'drum', 'part', 'just', 'have', 'laugh', 'when', 'Ginger', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'writing', 'credit', 'drum', 'part', 'White', 'Room', 'Yeah', 'sgnature', 'hook', 'song', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'words', 'just', 'bitter', 'old', 'man', 'Anyway', 'shame', 'reunion', 'ended', 'bitter', 'ruins', 'years', 'later', 'least', 'rest', 'still', 'have', 'music', 'way', 'CD', 'included', 'package', 'just', 'okay', 'sound', 'quality', 'pretty', 'lousy', 'performances', 'are', 'right', 'nothing', 'care', 'listen', 'more', 'once', 'twice', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'other', 'Cream', 'DVDs', 'including', 'Disraeli', 'Gears', 'one', 'other', 'Cream', 'history', 'go', 'get', 'first', 'actually', 'have', 'performances', 'everyone', 'better', 'mood', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', 'three', 'song', 'performance', 'Revolution', 'Club', 'sheer', 'joy']",N/A

It turned out to be very good - at nearly 2 hours long, it covers the pre-Cream bands the three were in, gives an excellent survey (with great details) of their heyday, and caps it off with taking us through the 2005 reunion concerts.  I particularly liked getting the story from the principals themselves (even down to details of what caused friction in the band - Ginger Baker really doesn't like Jack Bruce, which really comes across so-over-the-top as to be almost amusing; conflicts over the volume of amplifiers on stage, etc.).  the only reason i'd rate this four stars instead of five is that it really is best appreciated by the hard-core fan, or those wanting an understanding of the dynamic of the power trio and British rock scene of the 60's.  Lots of good interviews with other key people from the time, including great Ahmet Ertegun interview footage (among others) though there's a scarcity of Stigwood material (i figured there'd be more?).
