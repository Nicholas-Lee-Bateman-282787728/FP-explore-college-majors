603545,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B00005JLQN,,"[0, 0]","Colin Farrel delivers a captivating lead role in this New York City thriller as Stu Shepard, a sleazy and arrogant New York City publicist who is unwillingly put in a fatal lifeline game. Many may find a movie being reduced to one setting for nearly its entire duration to be boring, but it's far from it, as writer, Larry Cohen, manages to make the best of the NYC setting to make this a 5 star thriller.The plot of the story is that Stu has been going behind his wife, Kelly's, back with another woman, Pam. During afternoon rush hour, Stu uses a phone booth to make a call to Pam, when he's interrupted by a pizza delivery guy who tries to offer Stu a pizza. After angrily turning down the pizza deliverer and insulting him, Stu gets a call from a mysterious call from a man who just happens to know everything about Stu, his life, and his little love affair.The caller threatens Stu to not leave the phone booth or he'll shoot him. Our would-be antagonist claims to have put 2 others through this same scenario who committed heinous acts in life and that Stu is the next person on his list. Now with his life and pride on the line, Stu realizes that is only way out of this predicament alive is by playing this ominous sniper-happy psycho's game. The question is, who is this man? Where is he? And why is he obsessed with putting Stu through this psychological nightmare??Overall: Despite what anyone else may say, this is an intense psychological thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat and your eyes glued on the screen, wanting to know what happens next. The ending is a bit of a disappointment as its very anti-climatic and seemingly leaves way for a sequel. Despite the ending, pick up Phone Booth if you're looking for a thriller to keep you entertained for an hour",5,"Amazing ""Edge of the seat"" Thriller!",1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,1788,"['Colin', 'Farrel', 'captivating', 'lead', 'role', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'thriller', 'Stu', 'Shepard', 'sleazy', 'arrogant', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'publicist', 'who', 'unwillingly', 'put', 'fatal', 'lifeline', 'game', 'Many', 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'being', 'reduced', 'one', 'setting', 'nearly', 'entire', 'duration', 'be', 'boring', 'far', 'writer', 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'make', 'best', 'NYC', 'setting', 'make', '5', 'star', 'thriller.The', 'plot', 'story', 'Stu', 'been', 'going', 'wife', 'Kelly', 'back', 'woman', 'Pam', 'afternoon', 'rush', 'hour', 'Stu', 'phone', 'booth', 'make', 'call', 'Pam', 'when', 'interrupted', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'guy', 'who', 'offer', 'Stu', 'pizza', 'angrily', 'turning', 'down', 'pizza', 'deliverer', 'insulting', 'Stu', 'call', 'mysterious', 'call', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'know', 'everything', 'Stu', 'life', 'little', 'love', 'affair.The', 'caller', 'Stu', 'not', 'leave', 'phone', 'booth', ""'ll"", 'shoot', 'would-be', 'antagonist', 'claims', 'have', 'put', '2', 'others', 'same', 'scenario', 'who', 'committed', 'heinous', 'acts', 'life', 'Stu', 'next', 'person', 'list', 'Now', 'life', 'pride', 'line', 'Stu', 'only', 'way', 'predicament', 'alive', 'playing', 'ominous', 'sniper-happy', 'psycho', 'game', 'question', 'who', 'man', 'Where', 'why', 'obsessed', 'putting', 'Stu', 'psychological', 'nightmare', 'Overall', 'what', 'anyone', 'else', 'may', 'say', 'intense', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'ending', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'very', 'anti-climatic', 'seemingly', 'way', 'sequel', 'ending', 'pick', 'up', 'Phone', 'Booth', ""'re"", 'looking', 'thriller', 'keep', 'entertained', 'hour']",N/A

603548,A1X3HW20S9TK9P,B00005JLQN,Aaron Edson,"[1, 1]","I know what a lot of people are probably thinking.  How could a movie about some guy continually talking on a pay phone for an hour possibly be entertaining?  Well, thanks to some incredible direction by Joel Schumacher, and an outstanding performance by Colin Farrell, Phone Booth is able to pull it off easily.This is a project that has been kicked around Hollywood for years.  There where plans to have the movie be one long continuous shot, unbroken by editing.  The concept would be that the movie would only star two actors, one in the booth, and the other talking on the phone, unseen.  Actors like Tom Cruise, Will Smith, and Jim Carrey became interested in the role.  In the end, this idea was changed when the film was give to Joel Schumacher to direct, under a small budget, who cast Collin Farrell in the lead.The story concerns Stu (Colin Farrell), a married fast track publicist who could care less about anyone, unless they can do something for him.  He employees a college student as an apprentice, but fails to give him any pay for his hard work.  He also juggles around his clients as if they were beanbags and not people.  To top it all off, he is seriously thinking of having an affair.The latter is the reason why he is at the phone booth in the first place.  Stu makes a call to his mistress, Pam (Katie Holmes), every day from the same booth, to avoid the call from showing up on cell phone bills his wife checks.  When he finishes the call and hangs up, the phone rings.  Stu takes the call and starts a conversation with a mysterious stranger, a conversation that will change his life forever.The voice on the other end knows an incredible amount about Stu's life.  He knows about Pam, about all Stu's clients, and other personal details.  Furthermore, if Stu hangs up, he is told he will be shot with a rifle from one of the nearby buildings.Throughout the course of the movie we meet a diverse group of interesting characters.  This is one of the reasons why we never really get tired of the film.  Also, ""the voice"" on the line is not only disturbingly scary, but also ironically funny.  The movie is always throwing something new on the screen, keeping the audience absorbed in the action.What keeps the whole piece grounded is the performance that Colin Farrell gives.  This is without a doubt the best in his career to date.  There are moments when he's required to go from extreme anger and frustration to complete anguish and despair. This is a movie where he is required to have it all.Joel Schmacher directs this material wisely.  I particularly liked his opening sequence commenting on how it was once thought that people with cell phones were eccentric and outrageous.  Now, as the movie states, ""it has become a common symbol of status.""  The film is shot cleanly and with style, and Schmacher never loses focus on the story.This project was tedious, and a lot could have easily gone wrong.  But, in the end, Phone Booth proves to be worthwhile.  Thanks to a various group of talented people, we are provided with not only an entertaining action thriller, but an interesting character study as well.  It's not often we get both in a movie these days.  That may be reason enough to see Phone Booth.",4,Don't Go In That Booth!...Your Live Might Be On The Line...,1052265600,"05 7, 2003",2003,3235,"['know', 'what', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'probably', 'thinking', 'How', 'could', 'movie', 'guy', 'continually', 'talking', 'pay', 'phone', 'hour', 'possibly', 'be', 'entertaining', 'Well', 'thanks', 'incredible', 'direction', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'easily.This', 'project', 'been', 'kicked', 'Hollywood', 'years', 'where', 'plans', 'have', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'long', 'continuous', 'shot', 'unbroken', 'editing', 'concept', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'would', 'only', 'star', 'two', 'actors', 'one', 'booth', 'other', 'talking', 'phone', 'unseen', 'Actors', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'became', 'interested', 'role', 'end', 'idea', 'was', 'changed', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'give', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'direct', 'small', 'budget', 'who', 'cast', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'lead.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'Stu', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'married', 'fast', 'track', 'publicist', 'who', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'employees', 'college', 'student', 'apprentice', 'give', 'pay', 'hard', 'work', 'also', 'clients', 'were', 'beanbags', 'not', 'people', 'top', 'off', 'seriously', 'thinking', 'having', 'affair.The', 'latter', 'reason', 'why', 'phone', 'booth', 'first', 'place', 'Stu', 'call', 'mistress', 'Pam', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'day', 'same', 'booth', 'avoid', 'call', 'showing', 'up', 'cell', 'phone', 'bills', 'wife', 'checks', 'When', 'call', 'up', 'phone', 'rings', 'Stu', 'call', 'conversation', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'conversation', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'forever.The', 'voice', 'other', 'end', 'incredible', 'amount', 'Stu', 'life', 'Pam', 'Stu', 'clients', 'other', 'personal', 'details', 'Furthermore', 'Stu', 'up', 'told', 'will', 'be', 'shot', 'rifle', 'one', 'nearby', 'course', 'movie', 'meet', 'diverse', 'group', 'interesting', 'characters', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'tired', 'film', 'Also', 'voice', 'line', 'not', 'only', 'disturbingly', 'scary', 'also', 'ironically', 'funny', 'movie', 'always', 'throwing', 'something', 'new', 'screen', 'keeping', 'audience', 'absorbed', 'whole', 'piece', 'grounded', 'performance', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'doubt', 'best', 'career', 'date', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'required', 'go', 'extreme', 'anger', 'frustration', 'complete', 'anguish', 'despair', 'movie', 'where', 'required', 'have', 'all.Joel', 'Schmacher', 'material', 'wisely', 'particularly', 'liked', 'opening', 'sequence', 'commenting', 'how', 'was', 'once', 'thought', 'people', 'cell', 'phones', 'were', 'eccentric', 'outrageous', 'Now', 'movie', 'states', 'become', 'common', 'symbol', 'status', 'film', 'shot', 'cleanly', 'style', 'Schmacher', 'never', 'focus', 'story.This', 'project', 'was', 'tedious', 'lot', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'gone', 'wrong', 'end', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'Thanks', 'various', 'group', 'talented', 'people', 'are', 'provided', 'not', 'only', 'entertaining', 'action', 'thriller', 'interesting', 'character', 'study', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'often', 'get', 'movie', 'days', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'enough', 'see', 'Phone', 'Booth']",N/A

In a day and age when all suspense has been jettisoned so every damn film can drag on to about 3 hours till your butt goes numb, this is a real case of less in more...thank GOD for sense at long last!TWO: This is the type of film Hollywood doesn't make any more, like Speilberg's DUEL, this is a movie about an ""idea"" that sticks to the idea. (A guy trapped in a phone box by a killer).THREE: NO CGI! Thank GOD for that!FOUR: A one man tour de force performance, Colin Farrel doesn't do one liners every few edits between dozens of settings, etc, he is required to memorize lines and perform the way an actor in a theatrical play would have to and he does it well.FIVE: Not only is theater technique used, but this also revives the techniques of the radio play, with the voice of the caller and the sound of the gun cocking. You get to use your imagination!SIX: Metaphor. The serial kiler/stalker is out to make the main character face his own inadequacies and make a moral turnaround,so the voice on the phone could be a metaphor for God or perhaps his own conscience.SEVEN: Form. This movies plays with narrative form by telling a tale in real time and using a single setting, which sets it apart from the rest of standad Hollywood formula.OVERALL: A good, tense, amusing, thought-provoking and memorable thriller which proves low budget and short running time and a reliance on acting and dialog instead of Special Effects really can be as good if not BETTER than the Independence Day/Jurassic Park type indulgences and that a good little film will always have a place in this world.

603554,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00005JLQN,Alex Udvary,"[2, 3]","I remember when ""Phone Booth"" came out. I wanted to see it. Judging by the trailer it looked like an intense thriller. When it did open most of the critics seemed to like it. So, I thought I would go and see. But, I never got a chance. I have just seen this movie yesterday and I will admit, I feel somewhat disappointed.""Phone Booth"" is a movie that only a certain group of people will enjoy. It all depends on how you personally look at the situation. If your searching for logic don't bother. If you just want to sit back relax and most importantly DON'T THINK then you will enjoy the movie more than others. As I first started to watch this movie I belonged to the first group. I personally feel everything in life needs logic. And I became annoyed with the movie at first, and then after awhile I soon realized the ""correct"" way to view the movie. Don't take it so serious.A lot of people will have a problem with the whole premise. A man picks up a ringing phone in a phone booth. He doesn't recognize the voice but continues to stay on the line. This is where it's important to know which group you belong to. Logically if someone where to pick up a ringing phone and heard the voice this guy has you would hang up and walk away. But, what kind of movie would that make!? So logic must be thrown out the window. The man hangs up, the phone rings again, the man picks up again. And this is where the movie starts to take shape.The voice on the other end is done by (Kiefer Sutherland) the man is Stu Shepard (Colen Farrell). ""The voice"" wants Stu to confess all of his sins. It seems ""the voice"" has been tracking Stu down. He knows the name of his wife, he knows Stu is cheating on her and he even knows Stu's address. Of course, Stu would have to stay on the line long enough for this guy to tell him all of this lol. But Stu must now do everything this ""voice"" wants him to.Now, naturally no one really cares what I think about this movie. But, I think most people will agree with me that the whole movie revolves around why Stu continues to talk to this guy. What makes him pick up the phone a second time? This is what will bring the whole movie together, don't you agree? If I wrote this movie my approach would be ""the voice"" has his wife in the room with him. And if Stu doesn't do everything he says he will kill his wife. This would make more sense, and those looking for logic would get it. Another fault with the movie is, why does this guy care so much about what Stu does? Who exactly is HE?""Phone Booth"" nevertheless does have it's suspenseful moments. If you are willing to go along with the movie you may find your on the edge of your seat. The acting is fine and I suppose director Joel Schumacher does string everything together nicely. So there are some good points to the film but, the plot holes may be too much for some to completely enjoy.Bottom-line: An effective thriller depending on how you look at it.

603555,A5S3BAWLNT10P,B00005JLQN,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","""Phone Booth"" is simple, and it's strength lies in that simplicity, even if on a realistic level it seems to have a few plot holes.Colin Farrell plays Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell), a relatively sleazy and manipulative PR man who makes the major mistake of calling a female client he wants to seduce: Pamela (played by Katie Holmes) from a phone booth. As he's about to walk away, a pizza turns up for him. He tells the delivery guy to take it away. The phone rings again. He picks it up. On the other end of the line is a self styled angel of vengeance played by Kiefer Sutherland. If Stu hangs the phone up or moves out of the booth he is dead. A bullet through the side of the booth convinces Stu he isn't kidding.After the killer shoots a man in the street the police arrive backed with a small army of sharpshooters. Senior officer, Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker), tries to talk Stu out of the booth, and Stu can't tell him that he's in a sniper's sights.What the disembodied voice wants is for Stu to own up to his sins, particularly to his wife Kelly (Rhada Mitchell) and mostly they don't seem all that bad by current standards. He hasn't even slept with Pamela, the actress he was calling, he has just attempted to. And if he lies and manipulates, well he is in PR after all.The film wan't all that expensive to make. By definition it can't move away from the phone booth, which is supposed to be in New York but was actually filmed in Los Angeles. The script's by a true B- movie veteran of the industry, horror writer and director Larry Cohen, some of whose work I've much enjoyed. (Guilty as Sin, It's Alive, The Stuff) Joel Schumacher, who is sometimes an awful over the top director, directs. He was responsible for the terrible ""Batman and Robin"", and the not so good ""8mm"", but he's also done ""Falling Down"" and ""Flatliners"" both of which I did like.On this occasion Schumacher does seem a little worried by the film's reliance on one location and tries to glitz it up a little with computer graphics at the beginning and end - even taking us out in orbit around the planet - and split screen images in the middle. Phone Booth would not have suffered from being more claustrophobic.There are lots of questions one could ask about how believable the events in the film are, but it works pretty well as a thriller and as an exercise in free floating anxiety. Take Sutherland's character as a guilty conscience made real. A kind of very mean spirited ghost of Christmas past.Colin Farrell was wise to decide to do this script. No doubt he could see it gave the chance for a bravura performance. You don't even see his antagonist most of the time, and the focus is very much on Farrell. He makes the most of it, going from cocksure confidence to emotional melt down.The release of ""Phone Booth"" was delayed due to the real life crime of the Washington snipers. If their activities didn't increase paranoia enough in some places, ""Phone Booth"" should help to do so. As I said, totally the opposite of ""Adaptation"" but in its own modest way, pretty gripping.",3,Good film from an often bad director,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",2004,3067,"['Phone', 'Booth', 'simple', 'strength', 'simplicity', 'even', 'realistic', 'level', 'have', 'few', 'plot', 'holes.Colin', 'Farrell', 'Stu', 'Shepard', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'relatively', 'sleazy', 'manipulative', 'PR', 'man', 'who', 'major', 'mistake', 'calling', 'female', 'client', 'seduce', 'Pamela', 'played', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'phone', 'booth', 'walk', 'away', 'pizza', 'up', 'delivery', 'guy', 'take', 'away', 'phone', 'rings', 'again', 'up', 'other', 'end', 'line', 'self', 'styled', 'angel', 'vengeance', 'played', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Stu', 'phone', 'up', 'booth', 'dead', 'bullet', 'side', 'booth', 'convinces', 'Stu', ""n't"", 'kidding.After', 'killer', 'shoots', 'man', 'street', 'police', 'arrive', 'backed', 'small', 'army', 'sharpshooters', 'Senior', 'officer', 'Captain', 'Ramey', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'talk', 'Stu', 'booth', 'Stu', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'sniper', 'sights.What', 'disembodied', 'voice', 'Stu', 'own', 'up', 'sins', 'particularly', 'wife', 'Kelly', 'Rhada', 'Mitchell', 'mostly', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bad', 'current', 'standards', ""n't"", 'even', 'slept', 'Pamela', 'actress', 'was', 'calling', 'just', 'attempted', 'manipulates', 'well', 'PR', 'all.The', 'film', 'wa', ""n't"", 'that', 'expensive', 'make', 'definition', 'ca', ""n't"", 'move', 'away', 'phone', 'booth', 'supposed', 'be', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'script', 'true', 'B-', 'movie', 'veteran', 'industry', 'horror', 'writer', 'director', 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'work', ""'ve"", 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Guilty', 'Sin', 'Alive', 'Stuff', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'who', 'sometimes', 'awful', 'top', 'director', 'directs', 'was', 'responsible', 'terrible', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'not', 'so', 'good', '8mm', 'also', 'done', 'Falling', 'Down', 'Flatliners', 'did', 'like.On', 'occasion', 'Schumacher', 'seem', 'little', 'worried', 'film', 'reliance', 'one', 'location', 'tries', 'glitz', 'up', 'little', 'computer', 'graphics', 'beginning', 'end', 'even', 'taking', 'out', 'orbit', 'planet', 'split', 'screen', 'images', 'middle', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'suffered', 'being', 'more', 'claustrophobic.There', 'are', 'lots', 'questions', 'one', 'could', 'ask', 'how', 'believable', 'events', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'thriller', 'exercise', 'free', 'floating', 'anxiety', 'Take', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'guilty', 'conscience', 'made', 'real', 'kind', 'very', 'mean', 'spirited', 'ghost', 'Christmas', 'past.Colin', 'Farrell', 'was', 'wise', 'decide', 'do', 'script', 'doubt', 'could', 'see', 'gave', 'chance', 'bravura', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'antagonist', 'most', 'time', 'focus', 'very', 'much', 'Farrell', 'most', 'going', 'cocksure', 'confidence', 'emotional', 'melt', 'down.The', 'release', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'was', 'delayed', 'due', 'real', 'life', 'crime', 'Washington', 'snipers', 'activities', 'did', ""n't"", 'increase', 'paranoia', 'enough', 'places', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'should', 'help', 'do', 'so', 'said', 'totally', 'opposite', 'Adaptation', 'own', 'modest', 'way', 'pretty', 'gripping']",N/A

A simple concept and a limited set were still able to deliver a fine result.In essence, Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a regular user of the same phone booth and his calls and routine have been watched by a compulsive stalker (Keifer Sutherland) whom we never see until the film's end.  His voice alone, however, is menacing.  The stalker has a gun pointed at Shepard from a nearby window and prevents him form hanging up for fear of being shot.  The plot and the very life of Shepard blacken with time until a gripping denouement is reached.  The stalker is there but cannot be seen.  His influence is powerful.There are many, myself included, who would doubt that a film based largely in a phone booth could ever work.  To my surprise, it did.  The clever use of split screens and the lurking presence of the sniper ensure that one is kept on the edge of one's seat.  Hats off to both Farrell and Sutherland for making the concept work.

Fortunately, I didn't pay theatre prices to see this movie.  First of all, Colin Farrell is an excellent actor, and I liked the director's work in Falling Down &amp; Tigerland, so what was going on in when they started shooting this movie?I disagree with other reviewers who stated that the result shows that it is not possible to confine a movie to a small area.  It has been done successfully before such as Hitchcock's Lifeboat.  This movie, though, seems to throw in the towel before it begins.  I first became disenchanted with the opening sequence that was cartoonish.  Does anyone need a sociology lesson on society's dependence on telephone communication?  Did we need a narrator to introduce us to the phone booth, or it's last inhabitant (Farrell)?What this movie needed was simplicity, and subtlety.  That would have fitted with the theme and setting of the movie.  How about having the sniper's voice sound on the screen as it would have to the man in the phone booth.  Instead, he was made to sound like the narrator of The Shadow radio show (yes, I understand that it may have been intentional, get it...""Who knows what evil lurks in the heart of all men...?""  The sniper does as did the Shadow before him, but why is this needed?).  Also, the Farrell character's sin that leads to his misfortune is idiotic to say the least.  Think about it...he only talks about having an affair, but doesn't do it??What I thought would occur in this type of movie was that a normal Joe would have happened to have been at the wrong place at the wrong time, and be mistook for involvement in a shooting spree.  The tension would have been with his trying to resolve the victim's old quandary of ""Why Me"" while needing to stay in the booth for reasons he can't explain, and trying to overcome his predicament.  The producers' also try to give justification to the terrorist by having all of his shooting victims be nefarious sorts.  That type of vigilante moralism doesn't play too well anymore, if it ever did.

Since I found a valid and interesting point in this movie, and because I can only rate in integers to the site, I go up a half-star to 4 stars. Let me give you the reason.I feel that at least part of the premise for the suspense of the movie Phone Booth relies on the question of whether or not the Colin Farrell character is threatening to hurt the others around him, or if it is another person who is on the phone and keeps him there based on the possibility that the man on the other end of that phone is a killer/sniper. There are three main concerns about the incidents of Farrell's character and the phone booth. One, the policemen don't want anyone to get hurt because that is their jobs. Two, Farrell's character needs psycho-therapy. Three, either Farrell or the gunman may be dangerous.One; Farrell is a crazy lunatic who might kill someone. Should the police just kill Farrell? From the perspective of the police detectives, they aren't sure. At first, the police think Farrell is the problem. Later on, they kind-of swing into his story by default: not because the police believe that there is a gunman on the other end of that phone, but because the police have to find a way to disprove Farrell's story that he is innocent. Then, there is the perspective that Farrell is telling the complete truth, and therefore innocent. The police assume that if Farrell really hears a voice on the other end of the telephone, then he must be innocent: the gunman really exists, and, therefore, Farrell is actually a hero for the cops, but not because his life is perfect. This would be easy to accept, but for one thing: the gunman saves Farrell by getting him to admit his wrongs and mental ills by bringing them out into the open so Farrell can get help. I can't imagine why a gunman would do that, so this belief, (however real it seemed to the people with whom I spoke,) obviously seems the least plausible.Two, Farrell is making it up. Like a child, Farrell dreams that, if he tells a really wild lie, maybe his wife and his lover will come to terms with Farrell's conscience and he is forgiven. Whatever problems his conscience has in dealing with his unfaithfulness in his marriage can be forgiven for the qualities of valor he showed during the moment he pleads for mercy, the moment of the phone call of all phone calls; he feels bad from his conscience and doesn't know how to survive in that circumstance. He has put himself into a circumstance which he has not been in before and doesn't know how to act in it. The only way for him to redeem himself is through some kind of breakdown in Farrell where, like a Hitchcock film, there is only one way out for Farrell, and that is to redeem himself to his conscience. This theory has some merit of plausibility, but let's try again.Three, the Farrell character is delusional and may actually hurt others. He really believes he hears the voice on the other end of the phone, but it doesn't exist. He created the voice in his mind, but doesn't know this, and therefore believes it is truly there. In this scenario, anything and everything Farrell does in this movie can be seen as a call for help. If he doesn't get it, he might as well hurt others because there's no difference to Farrell, and the crime would be society's crime for not drawing a distinction for Farrell between what is right and what is not right. A mental breakdown is not only a breakdown, but a scary path of truth.Although I stated in my first interpretation that I can't imagine why a gunman would tell Farrell all that we hear in the film, I can imagine why Farrell would create this story. However, I can't agree with my second interpretation either, because the movie audience listens to the gunman's voice. We hear the voice because the story asks us to imagine what Farrell imagines. Because the audience hears the gunman talking with Farrell on the phone, the movie asks the audience to believe the gunman exists. If we don't believe it, then there is no incentive for the suspense. If there is no suspense, then Farrell had no problems. If Farrell had no problems, the movie would not exist. I can't imagine what this movie would be like if I were never to hear the voice of the gunman. It is the ""gunman"" who scares us. What scares us is thinking that someone will get hurt if nothing is done, which is, either way, the appropriate response. We cannot rob Farrell of a basic human need. Farrell deserves the time we give him, even if he made up the gunman. The reason to assume Farrell tells the truth is because the audience would rather believe it, but also because Farrell needs it.Robert E. Howard, author of the many Conan fantasy books, wrote all his novels in only a span of a few years.  His speed wasn't only due to workoholism.  Howard felt for many years that he was being forced to write his Conan stories under the supervision of a swordsman who would kill him if he stopped writing.  Howard later committed suicide, leaving a vast amount of books which he wrote in only a short time.  This swordsman was obviously a delusion.  This delusion caused him to commit suicide.  The quantity of Howard's writings for such a short period and his suicide both support the theory that he believed this delusion, that a swordsman was forcing him to write.  Robert E. Howard's true story is similar to my asserted delusion of Farrell's fictional character.My theory has depth when considering the mental state of Farrell.  The problem with the movie is that it offers too much information that seems to acquit Farrell.  However, this acquittal still does not pose the key significance in the film, which is really that Farrell has problems.  The ""gunman"" is Howard's ""swordsman"".  If he did exist, the movie would've been better not to prove it, because doing this leaves the suspense open to question on the basis of Farrell.  To accept Farrell's needs is to consider the possibility that he created the gunman in his imagination.  The movie might've been much better if it left the audience thinking that Farrell believes the gunman existed and could not prove it to the police.  This may be a fault of Paul Verhoeven who directed this project.The actions surrounding the phone booth are the actions of someone in need. If he hurts someone, it is not on a basis that he is a killer, but that he has worries larger than himself. His problems are the problems of mankind. The police know this, so they understand the way to calm the situation. Farrell doesn't want to hurt anyone. But, to live the way he's living... I'm actually grateful for Farrell's fortitude of the matter, and I truly hope that ANYONE who feels as bad as he, would call out for help, any way the person can. If the person doesn't, the world will always see a lot of pain, and this suffering is simply unacceptable.",4,A point for this movie,1125360000,"08 30, 2005",2005,6919,"['write', 'Amazon', 'review',

603565,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B00005JLQN,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[2, 3]","This movie is quite short, even when compared to the latest Disney movies that are 90 or more minutes long. Phone Booth is a short and sweet 82 minutes long, but don't think that the length makes it a bad movie. It's not at all. It's short because it works. The movie's situation is something that could actually happen to some poor schmuck who can't leave a ringing phone unanswered.The movie stars Colin Farrell as Stu, a hotshot publicist who walks around NYC in fancy designer suits toting his cell phone everywhere he goes. Everyday, he uses the same phone booth (so the call doesn't show up on his cell where his WIFE will see it) to call an actress (played by the sincere Katie Holmes) he's representing and also hoping to get into bed with. When he's finished talking to her, the phone rings, and not even thinking, he answers it. The voice on the other end tells him that if he hangs up, he'll shoot him.One of the great things about this movie is that you will not know what to think of Stu. In the beginning, you'll find that you only see Stu as a huge materialisitc jerk. I was actually hoping that he would get shot. As the story progresses, your mind may change and it may not. I won't tell you how I felt about Stu at the end, that would ruin the fun.Perhaps the most amazing aspect of this movie is how effective the voice on the other end of the phone is. The voice is Keifer Sutherland, sounding clear, but raspy and scary. And the motivation of this pyscho on the other end picking on poor Stu is excellent as well. Is he really a psycho afterall? Watch and judge for yourself.Colin Farrell does a great job playing a guy who is forced into an array of emotions while on the phone. It may not be Oscar worthy, but it's worth the bucks to see. And of course Keifer Sutherland, the forboding voice, is highly effective-- definitely a noteable performance.Good perfermances, interesting cinematography, and certainly a lead character that anyone can relate to at some point, this movie is most definitely worth seeing. With no frills or wasted minutes of exposition, it's quick, too the point, and just an all around awesome thrill ride.

It's very simple, very brief and occasionally thrilling. It goes exactly the way you expect it will, not needing to extend far beyond its simple premise of a morality play. A gunman, judging people at random from the sky, decides to make Farrell's tacky agent character face up to his sins. If he doesn't, he'll be dead ... or the friends who've gathered to watch his incident will be killed. So he stays on the phone and confesses to save everyone.Of course, the people around him also think that he's a crazed gunman, and he can do little to convince them otherwise. Therein lies the most interesting aspect of the film, one that the filmmakers don't exploit near enough.I remember an episode of ""Homicide: Life of the Streets"" that had a similar premise to this one, and I think the ""Homicide"" episode was slightly better than this movie.But, compared to the travesties Joel Schumacher has subjected upon movie audiences in the past, ""Phone Booth"" was merely slight - not offensive.",3,Slight but decent thriller.,1050796800,"04 20, 2003",2003,1330,"['Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'delayed', 'first', 'star', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'was', ""n't"", 'famous', 'enough', 'open', 'film', 'substantial', 'box', 'office', 'then', 'pushed', 'back', 'Beltway', 'Sniper', 'attacks', 'made', 'film', 'too', 'topical', 'release', 'was', 'compelling', 'was', 'watching', 'had', 'staying', 'power', 'whatsoever.It', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'very', 'simple', 'very', 'brief', 'occasionally', 'thrilling', 'exactly', 'way', 'expect', 'will', 'not', 'needing', 'extend', 'far', 'simple', 'premise', 'morality', 'play', 'gunman', 'judging', 'people', 'random', 'sky', 'make', 'Farrell', 'tacky', 'agent', 'character', 'face', 'up', 'sins', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'be', 'dead', 'friends', 'who', ""'ve"", 'gathered', 'watch', 'incident', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'phone', 'confesses', 'save', 'everyone.Of', 'course', 'people', 'also', 'think', 'crazed', 'gunman', 'can', 'do', 'little', 'convince', 'otherwise', 'Therein', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'one', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'exploit', 'enough.I', 'remember', 'episode', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Streets', 'had', 'similar', 'premise', 'one', 'think', 'Homicide', 'episode', 'was', 'slightly', 'better', 'movie.But', 'compared', 'travesties', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'subjected', 'movie', 'audiences', 'past', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'was', 'merely', 'slight', 'not', 'offensive']",N/A

I've actually taken the trouble to think about who my least favorite director of all time is, and Schumacher won the booby prize.So blame it on my incredibly low expectations, but I really liked this movie.  I agree with the other people here that the script is weak.  No effort is made to develop characters--it seems as if the screenwriter began to add dimension to Forest Whitaker's cop and then thought better of it.  But do you really want a lot of script in a movie like this?  The film makers were wise to keep the running time to a swift 80 minutes, and while I didn't think they were especially clever in the set up or execution, it was competent enough to hold my interest.I was pleasantly surprised by Colin Farrell's performance.  He's great, and does much more with what he's given than the material probably warrants.  I watched this by myself, but was still slightly embarrassed to find myself moved by his speech in which he confesses all of his sins to the assembled crowd.  Even as I'm writing this review, I can't believe I didn't find this display hokier, but I guess I was in the right mood at the time.This movie reminded me of the kind of &quot;B&quot; thriller they might have made in the 40's--slick, quick and not especially intended to impress.

Not many people could take a film that has 90% of it taking place in a phone booth and still make it good, but Schumaker pulls it off here. Colin Farrell really shines in this movie, and as the suspense mounts toward the film's resolution, you really feel sorry for him. The sense of hopelessness he's feeling becomes your own as you realize there's no easy way out of the situation. The only thing I have against this film is that it could have easily been made into a PG-13 film for a wider audience range with just the loss of profanity. The violence is not as full as Lord of the Rings, but every third word is profanity and that's what earned it the R rating.

The guy is in the phone booth because of a sniper. There's someone (he doesn't know who) aiming a gun at him from one of the hundreds of windows surrounding him (he's close to Times Square). To prove he's for real, the sniper shoots someone on the street, and everyone thinks it was the man (Colin Farrell). Pretty soon, there are S.W.A.T. team members and police everywhere. All they want is for him to get off of the telephone. But, that would cost him his life. Even with that plot, this could have been really bad. It somehow isn't though. Farrell is completly convincing as the ""I only care about myself"" business man. As the precious minutes tick by, and he slowly breaks down, you feel everything that he feels. The sniper starts to play mind games with him and us. Some people say they were dumb, but I personally loved the unique camera angels and split-screen.I was not bored for one minute of this movie.

In fact there were points in the movie where the tension level is considerable, where everything clicked perfectly.  Unfortunately, there are ultimately more hits than misses when all is said & done --- one is left unsatisfied with a movie that simply didn't live up to its potential.Just what was it about killers such as the Beltway Sniper that left people feeling so unsettled?  Simply put, it was the shere randomness of the killings --- the fact that one moment you could be some anonymous schlub filling his tank at a gas station, and the next moment you could be a corpse with a bullet in his or her brain.  Is it plausible that nut job with a gun could pick you out at random while you were making a phone call from a phone booth?  You better believe it is.  Is it plausible that he knows somehow has the means to know your entire personal history & is producing a miniature morality play just to teach you a lesson?  Not exactly.  Once the deed loses its random nature, it becomes much less compelling & simply seems contrived.On the other hand, the movie is quite brief --- a full two hours of this would have had me turning off the TV from boredom.  Everyone involved in the production process is to be commended for understanding the dangers of dragging out a storyline to point where it cannot be sustained.When all is said & done, you could do much worse with your viewing choices, but just think about how truly thrilling this movie could have been if the right choices had been made with the storyline.",3,Adequate --- but could have been pretty good,1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,1683,"['one', 'films', 'really', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'resulted', 'extraordinarily', 'tension-filled', 'movie', 'fact', 'were', 'points', 'movie', 'where', 'tension', 'level', 'considerable', 'where', 'everything', 'clicked', 'perfectly', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'ultimately', 'more', 'hits', 'misses', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'one', 'left', 'unsatisfied', 'movie', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential.Just', 'what', 'was', 'killers', 'such', 'Beltway', 'Sniper', 'left', 'people', 'feeling', 'so', 'unsettled', 'Simply', 'put', 'was', 'shere', 'randomness', 'killings', 'fact', 'one', 'moment', 'could', 'be', 'anonymous', 'schlub', 'filling', 'tank', 'gas', 'station', 'next', 'moment', 'could', 'be', 'corpse', 'bullet', 'brain', 'plausible', 'nut', 'job', 'gun', 'could', 'pick', 'out', 'random', 'were', 'making', 'phone', 'call', 'phone', 'booth', 'better', 'believe', 'plausible', 'somehow', 'means', 'know', 'entire', 'personal', 'history', 'producing', 'miniature', 'morality', 'play', 'just', 'teach', 'lesson', 'Not', 'exactly', 'deed', 'random', 'nature', 'much', 'less', 'compelling', 'simply', 'contrived.On', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'quite', 'brief', 'full', 'two', 'hours', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'turning', 'off', 'TV', 'boredom', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'production', 'process', 'be', 'commended', 'understanding', 'dangers', 'dragging', 'out', 'storyline', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'sustained.When', 'said', 'done', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'worse', 'viewing', 'choices', 'just', 'think', 'how', 'truly', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'choices', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'storyline']",N/A

603589,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JLQN,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","Let's face it, when Joel Schumacher makes a movie, he can either be pretty dead-on or just way off the page he's not even in the same book (read: Batman and Robin). Taking an incredibly flimsy premise and paper-thin plot and stretching it out to movie length should've been a call for disaster but the fact is that the movie ended up being so gripping makes one think it's anything other than a fluke. Is it Schumacher's direction? Colin Farrell's performance? Or is it that the premise is so original and even neat that it's hard not to be enthralled by it?Stu works in promoting clients in the Big Apple and often goes through rather misleading ways to get what he wants: promises a big bash for a restaurant he owes money to as payment, playing magazines against each other for bigger demand in his client and whatnot. He also has something he wants going on as well: a beautiful client, Pam, who he wants to be more than friends with. Instead of using his cell where his wife, Kelly, can check the calls, he uses a pay phone. Only after, he gets a call: a man(voiced by Keifer Sutherland of 24) is watching him and worse: he's got a sniper rifle. Stu has to figure out how to please the sniper and not get shot while also trying to do nothing that'll get policemen to fire at him.That's basically the entire plot: man in a phone booth talking to a sniper and on occasion people in the crowd such as Radha Mitchell of Silent Hill (Kelly) Katie Holmes (Pam) or the police captain played by Forest Whitaker. Why Keifer's character would spend his time on someone who hasn't committed adultery yet is strange but at least Colin acts his *** off and makes him completely likable by the end of the film. Known for a sort of intense whispering he does on 24, Sutherland basically unleashes his malevolence on Stu and it's so fun. Why they bothered though with Katie Holmes is beyond me since she barely has any significant lines and after awhile she just stares at stuff.Now of course the film has holes such as little plot holes or annoyances (a group of hookers needs a phone so they bother with the one Stu's stuck in...as the opening says, there's so many cell phone users or public phones and they just have to bug Stu about his?) But oddly enough the film is actually kind of short. I think my time code said something like an hour and 15 or 17 when the film ended and while there's not much to do with the premise, you get so caught up that you're like ""whoa whoa, that's all?""Back in the old days of DVD, many were on what was called a ""flipper"" meaning one half of the movie on one side, other half on the other. Now, it's been used mainly to separate the fullscreen version and widescreen such as now. While I have no issue with this, the special features are unbelievably small. We get a pretty good commentary by Schumacher that talks about the film but that's it, no making-of's or interviews, not even those back scratching ""I love working with that guy, he's so great"" EPK's you see on HBO. I'm sure they'll be a double-dip in the future but since it's not a massively liked film I'm sure it'll be awhile.Is it worth your time? Surprisingly yes.

However, he was not enough to save this movie from dying a slow and painful death.

Notably, Colin Farrell's character &quot;Stu Shepard&quot;, who uses the phone booth to call his mistress. That is where the action begins or the so-called action. I'm sorry, but a man standing in a phone booth an hour and 20 minutes in an hour and 30 minute movie is not my idea of spine-tingling action. About 40 minutes into it, I was begging the caller to shoot him. Forrest Whitaker's a great actor as well, but he nor Colin could save this movie. It was just annoying to watch. There were some good scenes, not many but there were some. The movie could have been set up a lot better than it was. It was like they jumped right into the heart of the story and sucked as much blood out as they possibly could. The last scene was really good, but the scenes before that leave you in a stupor.

Stu becomes the center of attention with all eyes of the media focused on him as a madman (Keifer Sutherland in an evil turn) tortures him with terrible decisions, forcing him to look at the superficiality of his life and the selfish and hurtful things he has done to people that care about him.  Katie Holmes plays a very small role and Forest Whitaker doesn't do a great deal either but the story is really centered around the two men sharing a phone line.  Colin Farrell gives a good performance (as well as being very easy on the eye!) and Keifer Sutherland makes a very convincing villain though we see him for maybe less than 5 minutes in the film.  Not a great movie but worth renting.

Does ""Phone Booth"" contain enough dramatic chills, thrills and hooks to keep even the most ardent moviegoer entertained? The answer is: Most definitely! Director Joel Schumacher uses the limited physical scenarios presented here to good use, including the panoramic camera angles, which add even more depth and intensity to the film's storyline. The viewer probes in on a talent agent named Stu (Colin Farrell), who is about to be the recipient of a rude awakening, courtesy of an 8th Avenue pay phone on the busy streets of New York City. A sinister voice on the other end of the phone line (voiced remarkably deceptive by Kiefer Sutherland, who has a brief cameo as well), is in complete control of Stu's person, badgering and threatening Stu to no end. Then, a swarm of mind games played on our innocent pay phone ""consumer"" ensues throughout much of the movie. The average viewer might see this film's plot as rather shallow and aimless, but they'd be missing the point. ""Phone Booth"" deals with society's ills in an off-handed sort of way as a whole, in that various people are dealt with difficult people and impossible situations from time to time, and must guard against such travesties at all costs, no matter what the odds are. Just because ""Phone Booth"" is a ""one-shot locale"" type film (featuring a limited geographic setting), doesn't make it a shallow picture, not even in the slightest bit. Colin Farrell's performance here is every bit as raw and powerful as is his previous role in another 2003 gem - ""The Recruit"", where Farrell gives a strikingly similar standout performance as well. Remember, this limited setting has worked wonders for fellow director John Hughes as well in ""The Breakfast Club"". Schumacher is well-known for his directorial prowess behind the camera in ""St. Elmo's Fire"" - a film which put Schumacher on the map. Since this ""Phone Booth"" is of high-intensity and quite dangerous, it should be entered with extreme caution, before it detonates.

It's been awhile since I've watched a white-knuckle thriller--a seat-squirming, heartburning, hit-the-pause-button-while-you-run-to-the-john pumper thumper.  PHONE BOOTH takes a simple--almost ridiculous--premise and turns it into an 80-minute rollercoaster ride.  Director Joel Schumacher should have included the instructions, &quot;Hold onto your seat&quot; on the DVD cover.Okay, so the film has a few problems, beginning with the sleaziness of the protagonist, Stu Shepard (played wonderfully by Colin Farrell).  Stu is not exactly the kind of guy one would like to have as a business partner--or, as it turns out, as a faithful spouse--yet over the course of the movie Farrell effectively brings humility and humanity to the character.  In addition, the sniper's control of the entire story requires a major suspension of disbelief, and the inability of police on the scene to quickly determine the person Stu is talking to on the phone as the &quot;bad guy&quot; is mind-boggling.But who cares?  PHONE BOOTH still delivers a spine-tingling thriller, centered around a terrified man unable to leave a phone booth lest the sniper (the magnificently evil voice of Kiefer Sutherland) would cut him down.  Forest Whitaker is also solid, albeit dense, as the police officer in charge of negotiating Stu out of the phone booth.  The ending is predictable, yet still wickedly done.

I also felt that the voice of Keifer Sutherland came across sounding too much like a newscaster, and was not scary enough. But then again, this movie belonged to Colin Farrell.

603611,A2CCWUHE0Q4G1M,B00005JLQN,Doran Steele,"[0, 1]","When I first heard the concept behind Phone Booth, I wondered how the film makers would be able to make a full-length film out of the concept of a guy getting stuck in a phone booth because a psycho sniper wants to shoot him.  Then I found out that the film is only 81 minutes long.  Couldn't they have padded it out to a more respectable 90 minutes?  I guess that the film makers ultimately were not able to make a full-length movie.  At several points in the film the action seemed rushed, like the film makers were trying to set land speed records for getting to the end of the story.This movie is a precursor to 2004's Cellular--the other movie about someone who has to stay on the phone in order to try to stay alive.  Neither of these phone-thriller films are great, but I liked Cellular better than Phone Booth.  In addition to its too-short running time, Phone Booth uses the tired Hollywood trope of the super-sneaky super-criminal who sets up the perfect crime.  The first couple of times watching films about these sneaky super-criminals were fairly entertaining, but by the time we get to Phone Booth, this idea has been well-worn and Phone Booth doesn't really have that much to add.  The super-criminal sets up everything perfectly and even the random events all work in his favor.  Nothing in life is that perfect and this film would have been a lot more interesting if things worked out less perfectly for the super-criminal.Then there is the question of why Collin Farrell's character ended up in the odd situation of being stuck in phone booth while being threatened by a sniper that he can't see.  At one point, the main character asks the villain why he was targeted and the villain explains that the main character is a rude jerk and he needs to be taught a lesson.  Now considering that the villain is some kind of vigilante who wants to make the world a better place, why would he set his sights so low and pick on some poor lout?  Yes, the main character is rude and borish and is in the process of working up to having an affair, but in grand scheme of things, are these flaws worth the super-villain's grand standing or the audience's attention?  If you are in the mood for a thriller involving a situation where someone's life depends on a phone call, I would recommend the film Cellular instead--it's not a great film, but it is better than Phone Booth.",2,Slow down and tell us a story,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,2381,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'concept', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'wondered', 'how', 'film', 'makers', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'full-length', 'film', 'concept', 'guy', 'getting', 'stuck', 'phone', 'booth', 'psycho', 'sniper', 'shoot', 'Then', 'found', 'out', 'film', 'only', '81', 'minutes', 'long', 'Could', ""n't"", 'have', 'padded', 'more', 'respectable', '90', 'minutes', 'guess', 'film', 'makers', 'ultimately', 'were', 'not', 'able', 'make', 'full-length', 'movie', 'several', 'points', 'film', 'action', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'film', 'makers', 'were', 'trying', 'set', 'land', 'speed', 'records', 'getting', 'end', 'story.This', 'movie', 'precursor', '2004', 'Cellular', 'other', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'stay', 'phone', 'order', 'try', 'stay', 'alive', 'phone-thriller', 'films', 'are', 'great', 'liked', 'Cellular', 'better', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'addition', 'too-short', 'running', 'time', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'tired', 'Hollywood', 'trope', 'super-sneaky', 'super-criminal', 'who', 'up', 'perfect', 'crime', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'watching', 'films', 'sneaky', 'super-criminals', 'were', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'time', 'get', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'idea', 'been', 'well-worn', 'Phone', 'Booth', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'add', 'super-criminal', 'sets', 'up', 'everything', 'perfectly', 'even', 'random', 'events', 'work', 'favor', 'Nothing', 'life', 'perfect', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'things', 'worked', 'out', 'less', 'perfectly', 'super-criminal.Then', 'question', 'why', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'character', 'ended', 'up', 'odd', 'situation', 'being', 'stuck', 'phone', 'booth', 'being', 'threatened', 'sniper', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'point', 'main', 'character', 'villain', 'why', 'was', 'targeted', 'villain', 'main', 'character', 'rude', 'jerk', 'be', 'taught', 'lesson', 'Now', 'considering', 'villain', 'kind', 'vigilante', 'who', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'why', 'would', 'set', 'sights', 'so', 'low', 'pick', 'poor', 'lout', 'Yes', 'main', 'character', 'rude', 'borish', 'process', 'working', 'up', 'having', 'affair', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'are', 'flaws', 'worth', 'super-villain', 'grand', 'standing', 'audience', 'attention', 'are', 'mood', 'thriller', 'involving', 'situation', 'where', 'someone', 'life', 'phone', 'call', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'Cellular', 'instead', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'better', 'Phone', 'Booth']",N/A

The basic idea of an elevator movie is to take a group of people, trap them in a small space so they can't get away from each other, place them under incredible stress, then sit back and watch how they react, and relate to each other. In Phone Booth the ""group"" is limited to one guy, and the space is as small as, well, a phone booth. Actually I misspoke, there is one more member to the ""group,"" a disembodied voice over a phone line (and if there were an Oscar for ""Best Disembodied Vocal Performance In a Live Action Movie,"" Kiefer Sutherland would be a shoein for his work in Phone Booth).Colin Farrell plays Stu Shepard, self-centered, lying, insincere, small time New York City publicist who hopes to cheat on his wife with a hot young actress (Katie Holmes). He calls her from the same phone booth every day, so his wife can't check his cell phone records. After being brushed off - again - he picks up the ringing phone a few seconds later, thinking it's the actress calling back, only to find he's just become the target - pun intended - of a rifle armed psycho who, for the rest of movie, plays vicious mind games with him. Stu can't leave the phone booth or he'll be killed. The rifleman blows away a pimp right in front of Stu. Hysterical prostitutes think Stu did it. Just about the entire NYPD shows up to point guns at Stu; he can't tell the police what's really happening; The Voice forces Stu to act insane, insult and taunt the police captain (Forest Whitaker) trying to get him out of the phone booth alive. His wife shows up, the actress shows up, everyone thinks he's a crazed gunman. The irony is there is a crazed gunman, but it's not him. And Stu is just about going frickin' nuts from the stress.Colin Farrell turns in a tour de force performance as Stu Shepard. He's quite believable as a not particularly nice guy pushed to the point of breaking, forced by The Voice to examine his soul and find it unworthy, to play a barbed wire game of cat and mouse with his tormentor, trying to figure out a way to tell the police what's really happening without letting The Voice know he's doing it. Because if that happens, he'll be instantly killed.My God, this is a great film. White knuckle time all the way through. If you've been thinking of buying this movie, do it.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","According to imdb, a thriller set in a phone booth was first pitched to Alfred Hitchcock back in the 1960s... you know, back when phone booths weren't an antique technological curiosity.And really, it's a tragedy that Hitchcock DIDN'T get to make this movie, because he would have wrung a brilliantly-shot, suspenseful story out of the simple concept. Instead, the people of 2002 got ""Phone Booth,"" a frenetic screaming mess directed by Joel Schumacher -- although Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland give glorious performances.Stu Shepard (Farrell) is a sleek, slick PR executive with a silver tongue. Despite being married to the beautiful Kelly (Radha Mitchell), he secretly uses the last phone booth in New York City to arrange meetings with a young starlet (Katie Holmes) whom he hopes to seduce.But after his call, the phone rings -- and a mysterious caller (Sutherland) reveals that he knows all about Stu's ugly little secrets. What's more, he has a sniper rifle, and has already killed a pedophile pornographer and a company insider for refusing to play his game. Now he's demanding that Stu call his wife and confess the plans he had made.But after Stu has an altercation with the world's most annoying prostitutes, the caller kills their pimp. Suddenly the phone booth is surrounded by the NYPD, who believe that Stu is the shooter. He can't hang up and cannot warn the police what is happening, even as the caller is threatening innocent people around him -- including his wife.""Phone Booth"" is a movie with a simple concept -- a man trapped in a phone booth, forced to admit all his sins and flaws by a devious murderer. The entire story revolves around what happens in the phone booth, and the entirety of New York City seems to shrink down around that little glass-and-metal box. Nothing much happens outside it.Unfortunately, this is directed by Joel Schumacher, who does not know how to direct suspense. Instead of building up a sense of claustrophobic terror and helplessness, he pelts us with screeching prostitutes, near-hysterical cops and a lot of idiots just standing by doing nothing. It's as if he thinks the frantic, frenetic tone will scare us -- and it doesn't.In fact, the scariest parts of the movie are also the quietest -- the moments where it's just the caller taunting Stu, and Stu desperately trying to find a way out of this mess without anyone dying.But the main two actors are simply superb. Despite a rather dodgy accent, Farrell's performance is a brilliant slow-motion picture of a man's polished, fast-talking exterior crumbling and peeling away, until he's forced to confront every ugly facet of himself. And Sutherland -- who is barely ever more than a voice -- is a gloriously ominous presence, with a deep rich voice that laughs and snarls through all of Stu's pain. The moment when he pretends to be wracked with childhood angst is both funny and terrifying.Forest Whitaker also has a nice smaller role as a police chief who manages to work out that something weird is going on with Stu. Radha Mitchell and Katie Holmes are pretty much wasted, though.""Phone Booth"" is a directorial disaster, but it is saved somewhat by a truly amazing pair of central performances -- and one of them barely even appears onscreen.

Laway ""Lady E""","[1, 6]","A suspense thriller, a really good one, is suppose to hold your attention and keep your nerves taut even while the credits are rolling. &quot;Phonebooth&quot; is really not one of these.  First off let's look at the plot:  A jerky publicist, Colin Farrell, walks into one of the remaining phonebooths in Manhattan to call a potential candidate for an extramarital affair.  A psycho sniper rings the phone and engages him in a &quot;look scared, or I'll shoot you&quot; game.  Why a phonebooth, it is in keeping with his slimy character.  He doesn't want his wife (Radha Mitchell) to trace his cell phone records.  As I remember in the opening scene, Farrell's assisstant was holding three cell phones, why didn't he just use one of these? Frankly, I avoid using any public phones these days, besides the Radha Mitchell character seemed like a really nice lady, the kind that doesn't go around tracing her husband's whereabouts.  Another hole in this movie is why did the sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) pick him?  Couldn't the movie focus on the others that he has killed, like the childmolester or the scumbag wallstreet investor?  We all have brief fantasies about cleaning the streets of these kind.  The movie just never set the tone right from the begining. And Sutherland's voice gets comical after a while.

I wouldn't go so far as to name PHONE BOOTH as one of the great thrillers of all time, but it does deserve credit. First of all the concept is very creative. Trying to hold an entire movie in a phone booth is a very demanding challenge, and I must say that Joel Shumacher has managed to pull it off well. The acting is good. Colin Farrell's potrayal as the victim of the sniper's ingenious plan is well done, although I wouldn't have cared if he got killed. Forest Whitaker pulls off the best acting performance in this film. But what kept me interested is Keifer Sutherland. His voice is terrific. It had the vile,condescending and menacing tone that this role would require. I just wish that Fox did not reveal that he was in this movie. It would have been a better ending that way. The only problem I had with the movie is that I didn't feel for Colin Farrell's character. But maybe we weren't supposed to feel for his character.

603625,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00005JLQN,General Zombie,"[1, 2]","'Phone Booth' was one of those movies where I found myself both very interested but still skeptical: It had a very intriguing concept, but could it fly as a feature length film? The answer is yes, though Schumacher and Cohen knew to play it safe and bring this one in as quickly as possible, as it clocks in at a mere 75 minutes, not including the credits.  I generally like films that are long and slow and layered, but it's also great to see a film where the makers can see the limits within the setup and only take it just as far as it'll go. What can I say, it's just a very entertaining, relatively intelligent thriller with lotsa great dialogue, solid performances and an energetic visual style.  Good stuff.It's seems unlikely that anyone won't know it already, but I'll provide a brief plot synopsis: Colin Farrell plays a slimy, lying PR man who at the films open goes out to a phone booth to make a call to his potential mistress. Shortly after he finishes talking to her the phone begins to ring, and he picks it up to find a murderous madman, voiced beautifully by Kiefer Sutherland, on the line. It seems that the caller isn't terribly pleased with Farrell's lifestyle and wants to teach him a lesson via his sniper rifle. He's not just going to kill him, however; he's got bigger things planned. I certainly could go on, and lotsa stuff was revealed in the trailer, but now that it's been a couple of years since this came out people might not remember, and I don't wanna give anything away unnecessarily. Suffice to say that Cohen and Schumacher find a way to wring a lot more out of the situation than you'd probably anticipate, and there are a couple of really very surprising developments.Stylistically, 'Phone Booth' is a very modern, rather derivative film, coming across as a combination of David Fincher and '24'. Schumacher's use of the split screen stuff occasionally comes across as unnecessary and overdone, but it all works well as a whole, allowing the movie to maintain interest, visually despite the fact that it's mostly just a buncha people standing around.The performances are solid and professional. Some have complained about Farrell's accent, and I'll admit that I didn't find it totally convincing, but I stopped noticing it after a while. (Plus, all the New York accents I ever hear come from TV and Movies, so I guess I don't really even know how accurate it is.) More significantly, Farrell just finds the right balance in the role, showing Stu to be quite a scuzzbag, but still kinda likable anyway. Sutherland is great as the Caller, and I suspect that how much you like this movie will be predicated on how much you enjoy his character. I found him enormously entertaining, very funny and with a lotta classic lines. (The best one: Towards the beginning Stu says he doesn't believe the Caller and threatens to hang up the phone, so the Caller cocks his rifle. He says: 'Now doesn't that just torque your jaws? I love that. You know like in the movies just as the good guy is about to kill the bad guy, he cocks his gun. Now why didn't he have it cocked? Because that sound is scary.') Nobody else has too big of a role. Forest Whitaker plays the captain whose trying to figure out just what the hell is going on here, and he acquits himself nicely, edging along the cop-character cliches while not actually falling prey to them. Unfortunately, the film feature the lightweight non-actress Katie Holmes, but as fate would have it she's playing a lightweight, naive wannabe actress, so she works out alright.The film gets a little speech-heavy and preachy at the end, but what can I say, I thought it worked. The speeches were well written enough, and delivered under relatively plausible circumstances. I've heard the film called a morality play, and I think that describes it pretty well, but it never forgets that the first goal of any film should be to entertain. It also ended more effectively than I'd anticipated. I didn't think they'd be able to wrap it up very well, but they found a way.Yeah, I'm done.

I knew what was going to happen at the end and I knew who would be blamed with everything.There's just not much to this film.  It's threadbare in its plot.  You don't really care about the lead (Farrell), nor do you give a flip about anyone else.  There's no reason to.  The screenwriters nor the director bother giving us enough information to feel any identification with any of the characters.Phone Booth garnered hype only because at the time of its initial release, a sniper started shooting up D.C. in reality.

603636,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B00005JLQN,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[1, 1]","Let me preface this review with the fact that I am not a big Colin Farrell fan, though this was probably the best movie I've seen him in.  Essentially he plays a bottom rung publicist named Stu who seems to want to desperately cheat on his wife.  I would not say this movie speaks for all Farrell films, because this is one of the greater ones.  However, I do like Keifer Sutherland.  Be that as it may, I did enjoy this movie in the end.  I realize most people would think the premise of this film is fairly stupid, such as a movie based on Colin Farrell being stuck in a phone booth.  I know... sounds exciting right?Surprisingly the drama in the film really drove it a lot better than I could have ever expected.  Granted this might be due to the fact that I had pretty low expectations going in, but I will say it certainly beat them.  I'm not saying this is a top movie and a must see, but it's worth giving it a shot, that's for sure.  It's actually a pretty interesting premise when you get into it because it basically has Keifer's character holding Farrell hostage in a phone booth the entire time.  Strangely the whole movie is filmed without seeing Keifer until the end of the film, but all you hear is his voice throughout.  Instead, Keifer is holding him at gunpoint from a window that Farrell can't even see.  So it's up to Keifer to prove to him that he has the means to kill Farrell.Just about everything Keifer's character says is awesome.  Especially the part where he cocks the gun and explains why that sound is cool.  I have to admit that it was Keifer that really drove the movie and got me into the film, even though he wasn't even on screen.  The fact he was basically playing a hitman (or sharpshooter technically) that was shooting people because he didn't like them was great, and somewhat fairly unique for the development of this film.  Especially since Kiefer's character is sort of trying to right the world by forcing people to adhere to a more moral/ethical code of life.As you can see Forest Whitaker's character didn't do that much for me.  He was just the cop who spent his time trying to figure out what Farrell was doing.  It's kind of an essential role for the reality factor, but it was just a standard police negotiator type of role that people have seen many times over.Either way, some people will walk away with more from this movie than others.  That morality twist in the film on what is actually more wrong really makes you sit and think about it.  This is where the movie shines.  The movie doesn't have that much re-watch value overall, but if you can find the DVD for a bargain price, it's a quality five dollar movie.  Or if it just happens to be on TV, definitely worth sitting down to watch.  It's not the kind of movie that will keep you and your friends talking for a long period of time, but I say it's at least worth seeing once.

Put simply, he's just skill.This movie kicks total ass in every way, shape, and form; It's pacing was perfect, the ongoing conversation between the protagonist and antagonist was insanely well written, and the tension that was being built, established, exploited and then furthered was nerve wracking to a fault.Oh and I gotta bring up the best part; Just about the whole movie takes place IN the phone booth!This premise should have contributed to a boring movie, but in the end, the movie got just about everything right,and for The Bottom Line, this movie weighs in at an92%- With intense performances, a fascinating concept, and a killer exposition, Phone Booth succeeds as a both a stellar movie and an amazing psychological thriller",5,From The Director Who Brought Us Batman and Robin Comes...,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",2014,1290,"['When', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'excited', 'right', 'bat', 'believe', 'was', 'cautious', 'seeing', 'who', 'directed', 'movie', 'hey', 'went', 'movie', 'being', 'fair', 'was', 'fair', 'how', 'was', 'Holy', 'Crap', 'defiantly', 'one', 'best', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""n't"", 'surpass', 'Sixth', 'Sense', ""'d"", 'say', 'close', 'second', 'third', 'Now', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'swear', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'single', 'time', 'quote', 'awesome', 'Every', 'movie', 'see', 'reasserts', 'acting', 'ability', 'Put', 'simply', 'just', 'skill.This', 'movie', 'kicks', 'total', 'ass', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'pacing', 'was', 'perfect', 'ongoing', 'conversation', 'protagonist', 'antagonist', 'was', 'insanely', 'well', 'written', 'tension', 'was', 'being', 'built', 'established', 'exploited', 'then', 'furthered', 'was', 'nerve', 'wracking', 'fault.Oh', 'got', 'ta', 'bring', 'up', 'best', 'part', 'Just', 'whole', 'movie', 'place', 'IN', 'phone', 'booth', 'premise', 'should', 'have', 'contributed', 'boring', 'movie', 'end', 'movie', 'got', 'just', 'everything', 'right', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'movie', 'an92', '%', 'intense', 'performances', 'fascinating', 'concept', 'killer', 'exposition', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'stellar', 'movie', 'amazing', 'psychological', 'thriller']",N/A

""A ringing phone needs to be answered"" is the catch phrase of the movie.  Colin Farrell answers it and what ensues is an 81 minute movie about a mans own evil nature.  Director Joel Schumacher hasn't had a good film since A Time To Kill.  This one is not a good start.  There are holes in this plot I could drive a truck through, if you can call it a plot.  This is 81 minutes worth of a movie that is a good free rental but a waste to pay for.  So why have i titled this review with the title I have?  Because Kiefer Sutherland is one of the great actors of our time.  He is so believable as the voice on the other end of the phone that you can actually see in your own mind what he is doing.  Only a great actor like Kiefer could have played this part.  He makes the movie watchable and at the conclusion he leaves an impression.  You will never look at a pay phone the same way again.  I recommend this to only die hard Colin Farrell fans and also people that like Kiefer Sutherland as a bad guy.  This is Kiefer in true form.Otherwise, avoid it like the plague.

I myself (agreeing with many critics) found it to be EXTREMELY tenseful and engrossing. Once that phone call started, my heart was pounding like a beast. Joel Schumacher, the director of many films (St. Elmo's Fire, Batman &amp; Robin), definately had a hard task of making a movie all around one phone booth. But he suceeded in bringing tons of intense moments and so forth. Colin Ferrell does a fine job of bringing the greedy Stu Shepard to life. Forest Whitaker, the cop who is dealing with the situation, did a great job in the realism of his character. He was fun to watch. Kiefer Sutherland, the sniper on the phone, was also great even though you just hear his voice.Phone Booth is the story of a man, Stu Shepard, who's a tricky PR guy and a cheating husband. When he stops in a Manhattan phone booth to call his second love (girl he's cheating with), he gets a call from an odd man. He then realizes, thanks to a red dot, that he's being pinned in the booth my a sniper. After a little inconvenice with hookers and their manager, the cops are all around, while Stu is stuck on the phone with a maniac.Phone Booth was a great film and finely crafted. Rent this movie.

Colin Farrell stars as a man in New York City on 53rd Street.  He uses this payphone booth everyday to call his girlfriend.  This phone booth is the last glass-enclosed with a door (like the one's used in the 1970's) that exists and the only one working in the area.  So Colin uses the phone booth to place a call like he always does.  Then the phone rings for him.  It is a sniper.  If he leaves the booth he would be killed.  The sniper (voice of Kiefer Sutherland) can even make a three-way call and try to destroy the relationship Colin has with his girlfriend.  The laser-rifle is pointed at Colin.  One wrong move, one wrong phone call.../ Yet another film that is off-tint.  I dislike this color process of film where the color is altered.  Color-bleaching, I dislike this too.  The outside scenes with Colin are all off-tint or color faded.  When he makes a phone call, we see a little &quot;window&quot; of who he is talking to in full color.  Plays better on television.

Well, get ready to be surprised, this movie was interesting from beginning to end. I'm not saying this is the best movie ever, but it definitely kept me interested.Colin Farrell plays a big hot shot show biz type who thinks the world begins and ends with him. After noticing his behavior and how he treats others, someone decides to knock him down a few pegs. The man who decides to teach him a lesson (Kiefer Sutherland) traps our star in a phone booth by threatening to shoot him with a very high powered riffle if he dares to hang up the phone. After he has our star's complete and total attention, he makes him come clean to his wife, and the world proving that he is a fake who steps on people to get what he wants.

603652,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,B00005JLQN,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[0, 0]","Phone Booth is basically a silly little film that has absolutely no right to be as good as it actually is.  The premise itself is one of those cinematic challenges that is beloved by students in film school but which rarely produce anything worth the effort in reality.  Almost the entire film takes place in a phone booth and the challenge is to see whether or not the image of one guy talking and talking (and talking) on a phone can be made into compelling entertainment.  It's not quite up to the level of remaking Psycho shot-by-shot (but in color!) but it's still the sort of thing that leaves one wondering whether the director or writer ever considered that maybe there's a good reason why not many movies take place in phone booths.The film stars Colin Farrell as a publicist who is meant to come across as sleazy but, in the film's oddly quaint view of a Godless New York, basically just seems to be a little overneurotic.  One day, Farrell happens to be standing next to one of New York's last phone booths.  That phone just happens to ring, Farrell just happens to answer it, and suddenly he's being told by Keifer Sutherland that if he leaves the phone booth, he will be [killed].  If the movie had just stuck with this storyline, it would have been a perfect recreation of everyone's worst nightmare -- being targeted ... by an unknown person for absolutely no reason.  However, the film for some reason feels the need to give a reason and that's where it all gets a bit silly as it turns out that Sutherland's unseen sniper has specifically targeted Farrell and that this whole seemingly random situation is part of a plot so elaborate that -- even given the rubber logic we've come to expect from most movies -- it becomes obvious that the whole success of Sutherland's scheme depends on absolutely nobody behaving like they have a brain.  Unfortunately, it's not enough that Farrell's character find himself in a living nightmare.  No, he has to go through a living nightmare so that he can become a better person as a result.Still, the film is entertaining as long as you don't give it too much thought.  Director Joel Schumacher has made a surprisingly lucrative career out of imitating the style of other superior directors.  If his Batman films were his attempts to imitate a Bob Fosse musical, then Phone Booth finds Schumacher attempting to morph into an edgy, urban, indie film brat.  Like all good imitations, Schumacher's direction presents an enjoyable (and, at times, almost convincing) surface without really developing anything underneath.However, what saves the film are the performers.  Colin Farrell is a wonder in the lead role.  On screen for nearly the entire running time, he is thoroughly convincing at conveying both a strangely innocent (and just as strangely endearing) insincerity in his first few scenes and he also perfectly captures his character's slow emotional breakdown as the film progresses.  Madly seesawing from cockiness to anger to desperation (often in the same scene), Farrell is consistently sympathetic throughout the film.  Even if you never believe the situation, you still hope he manages to get out of it.  Sutherland, in what amounts to a voice over role, still manages to convey his character's perverse insanity and, if the script requires him to break into melodramatic laughter one too many times, he still manages to make the most of it.  As the women in Farrell's life, Radha Mitchell and Katie Holmes have thankless roles but both are sympathetic.  However, the film's real surprise is Forrest Whittaker, playing a soft-hearted police captain who has to decide whether or not Farrell is a madman or a victim.  After years of directing glossy, Joel Schumacherish films and giving listless performances, Whittaker returns to form with Phone Booth.  Whether accidentally sharing too many details about his recent divorce or trying to keep the other cops from blowing Farrell away, Whittaker manages to project the everyday man integrity and good humor that distinguished his earlier work in films like Good Morning, Viet Nam and The Crying Game.Phone Booth isn't the cinematic masterpiece it aims to be but it proves that Colin Farrell is a movie star and it provides a nice cinematic comeback for Sutherland and Whittaker.

Munson,"[2, 2]","In the span of 75 minutes, the directors of ""Phonebooth"" have packed a ton of fast-paced psychological suspense that will be sure to glue audiences to the screen.  Colin Farrell gives a superior performance as Stu Shepard, a sleazy publicist for struggling actors.  Stu decides to use a phonebooth to make a call and his life changes forever.  While in the booth, the phone rings, Stu answers, and he soon discovers that a psychopath with a high-powered rifle is on the other end.  Soon, Stu is begging for his life as the caller (Kiefer Sutherland) asks Stu to answer questions about his infidelity to his wife Kelly, played by Radha Mitchell, his infatuation with Pamela McFadden (Katie Holmes), a young actress he has become involved with, and also bearing his soul to other things as well.Meanwhile, a group of hookers try to get Stu out of the phonebooth, but he won't leave.  Finally, the pimp comes over to try, but he ends up getting shot by the caller.  Instantly, the hookers think that Stu is the shooter, and soon the phonebooth is surrounded by police and SWAT team members.  Captain Ramey, played by Forrest Whitaker, attempts to talk Stu out of the phoneboot, but to no avail.  Finally, Stu is able to alert the police with his cell phone about the sniper.This is an excellent DVD.  The pop-up screens really help the viewer follow the action more closely.  Colin Farrell, Forrest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell, and Katie Holmes all give excellent performances throughout the movie.  The viewer only gets to see Kiefer Sutherland briefly at the end, but his voice really makes the caller scary and menacing.  Watch this highly entertaining psychological thriller.

He did a good job with Tigarlands and A Time to Kill, Lost Boys and Flatliners weren't bad either. So the guy has talent, you just can't see that by watching Batman & Robin lol.Colin Farrell (DareDevil, Tigarlands) stars as Stu a jerk who plays people how he sees fit. He thinks he's better than other people and he gets knocked down a big notch. He uses a pay phone to call a potenial actress (Katie Holmes) who he's interested in sleeping with....when he's married. A mysterious and menacing man (Kiefer Sutherland) calls after his call with her from that pay phone telling him not to hang up or he'll kill him. The Sniper kills someone who was trying to get Stu to get off the phone and the cops come thinking Stu did it. Stu has to convince a cop (well played by Forest Whitiker) that he's not the shooter without actually saying he's not. He also of course has to find a way to get out of the phone booth alive.Phone Booth is an entertaining edge of your seat thriller even if it doesn't work entirely. For instance it's silly that it starts out with a Twilight Zone type narration introducing Stu. The film is  too short and we never learn much about the sniper. We don't learn why he finds the need to interfere in people's lives and try to play social worker....but with a sniper rifle. Kiefer Sutherland is great though even if it is just a voice over role. He's menacing and extremely scary, yet some how even amusing. Colin Farrell is very good as well in a role so many big stars such as Jim Carrey turned down.

He's pinned in a phone booth for what feels like hours as the sniper makes him confess his petty sins. Farrell is great as he disintegrates before our eyes, to become totally unrecognizable by the end of the ordeal. The movie made me think--sure, there are many people who are a lot worse, but Stu, multiplied many times over, is the kind of guy who makes life an exercise in low-grade misery for hundreds of others.

I will admit that the film was original, thrilling, and somewhat of a fable with a universal moral. But that's being generous. PHONE BOOTH is on the edge of terrible. It's uneven and rough. It confuses itself between a tale and an action film. Farrell plays Stu, a fast-talking publicist who gets trapped in a New York phone booth when a sniper hunts him down and threatens his life. For the next hour, Farrell is forced to admit all of his faults, all of his lies. Not an act of cruelty, the sniper's goal is to teach Stu a lesson he will never forget. I suggest that if you want something different, then see PHONE BOOTH. If you are into likeable films, then pass. The film has an interesting premise. Forrest Whitaker plays a cop trying to figure out what is going on. Witnesses claim to have seen Stu shoot a man, when in fact it was the sniper. The story becomes more and more twisted. The script is a little creative, and Colin Farrell is surprisingly intense and excellent. The film runs 80 minutes, and its strange how it seemed so much longer. There's a lot of crude language. A lot. And despite being one of the most original movies of the year, I'm just going to say, DISCONNECT.

603661,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JLQN,Joe Sherry,"[4, 4]","I first heard of Phone Booth a year or two ago when Jim Carrey had dropped out of the project.  I loved the premise: a man answers a ringing phone and steps inside the phone booth.  He is told by the man on the phone that he is in the sights of a high powered rifle.  The movie will be an hour and a half and will take place almost exclusively in the phone booth.  It sounds very experimental and could be a horrible failure or be very interesting.  The movie was delayed for a reason I don't remember, and then it was delayed this past fall because of the sniper attacks in Washington D.C.  Finally, the movie gets released this April and I finally get a chance to see this movie that I've been hearing about for a long time now.I've already mentioned the basic plot of the movie, so I'll go into a little bit more detail on the story.  Colin Farrell plays a slick publicist who calls his girlfriend (but takes off his wedding ring while making the call) from a phone booth so that his wife does not find out about it.  When he finishes with the call, the phone rings.  He answers it and now finds himself in a situation where if he leaves the booth, a sniper threatens to kill him.  The voice of the sniper is played by Keifer Sutherland, and this casting is perfect.  I cannot imagine anyone bringing more menace to a phone conversation than Sutherland.  While Farrell does a very good job in his role, it is Sutherland that makes the movie.  Unfortunately, it is Sutherland's character that is without strong motivation.  We must accept that he is a nut, because his reasoning is not very credible (maybe that is the point, but even so).  Despite this flaw, I absolutely loved the movie.There was quite a bit of tension and suspense all the way through the film, with enough brief scenes of humor (sometimes the humor came from the tension) to not make it unbearable.

603663,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B00005JLQN,"John ""MovieAddict""","[4, 8]","You're walking down a busy street. You pass a phone booth. The phone starts to ring. Do you pick it up? It must be part of the human psyche, but it seems that there is just something that makes us want to pick up that phone. We do.The same thing happens to New York City publicist Stuart Shephard, when he thinks nothing of picking up a phone on a Downtown street. On the other end is an unnerving voice that tells Stu not to hang up the phone. Stu soon realizes that the man--whoever he is and wherever he is--has a rifle. A sniper rifle.The Caller (Kiefer Sutherland) tells Stu that his lack of honesty and inhumanity has made him the target for this extortionist plot. If Stu hangs up the phone, he is dead. If Stu tells anyone who is on the other end of the phone, he is dead. The Caller wants Stu to confess his sins, which includes telling his wife why he uses a payphone every day instead of his cell phone.The reason is because Stu has been having a fling with a wannabe actress. The actress has no idea Stu's married. But when the Caller forces Stu to tell his wife the truth on television, everyone knows. But the Caller still won't let Stu go. He's never going to. Stu will be killed before the day is over.If the cops surrounding the place don't do something about it very soon.""Phone Booth"" is brought to us by Joel Schumacher, a man many hate yet many adore. He is the man responsible for the previous two ""Batman"" installments. Many claim him of ruining a series, when, in fact, the series was ruined by the first sequel. Joel Schumacher is too heavy on the darks in his ""Batman"" films, and his directorial efforts can be very bad. But he also brought us the wonderful character breakdown story ""Falling Down,"" a film I have been quoted as saying is one of the best films of 1993. He also brought us the Brat Pack film ""St. Elmo's Fire,"" the other Kiefer Sutherland film ""The Lost Boys,"" and, among others, the tragic ""Bad Company"" and ""8MM."" But ""Phone Booth"" has some of the attributes of all those films. It has some ""Falling Down"" in it, some ""Bad Company"" in it (shudder), some ""Lost Boys"" in it, and yes, even some ""Batman & Robin"" in it. But it's on the same level as ""Falling Down,"" i.e. it's a very watchable, if somewhat repetitive thriller.My first impression upon seeing previews for ""Phone Booth"" was that I thought it had some real potential. Given the right dialogue and director, a boring situation can be turned into an intense one. Take, for instance, the scene where Stu is being commanded by the Caller to take a hidden handgun from the phone booth and wave it at the cops. We don't know how he's going to get out of it. But then when he does, we think to ourselves, ""Why didn't I think of that?"" I like thrillers that make a situation seem inevitible, then suddenly solve the problem.Colin Farrell sports a good New York City accent, and Kiefer Sutherland sports a good Willem Dafoe voice. He's creepy, strange, and thanks to the film's technique of Hitchcockian suspense, we don't see him.

603666,A2NBOL825B93OM,B00005JLQN,J R Zullo,"[1, 1]","You have to take care with Joel Schumacher. After all, he was responsible for the transformation of  the dark and gothic Batman stories into colorful little adventures (with nipples). In fact, after ""Falling down (1993)"", Schumacher's career seemed to be falling apart, even if he had opportunity to work with good scripts (""Time to kill"" and ""8mm"") and good actors (Nicholas Cage, Robert deNiro, Anthony Hopkins).The thing is, ""Phone booth"" worked very well with me. Up-coming superstar Colin Farrell, once again being comprehensible as an american character, is Stu Shepard, a busy PR in New York City. He's married, and has a girlfriend. So that his wife doesn't find out he's calling the girlfriend on the cell phone, he makes those ""low profile calls"" on a phone booth. The story of ""Phone booth"" develops as Stu is leaving the phone booth after calling the girlfriend; then the phone rings, and he's compelled to pick it up. After that, he's drawn into a nightmare appearently without any reason to be happening.Simply made, filmed in only 12 days, ""Phone booth"" makes you seat on the edge of the seat the whole 90 minutes. Almost the entire story revolves around the booth. Schumacher uses a resourse you've seen plenty in Brian dePalma's movies: dividing the screen in aas many as four sections, so you can see different angles of what is happening at the same time. This works very well. Also, Kiefer Sutherland's voice as the sniper, the good performance by Farrell, together with good but smaller performances by Forrest Whitaker (as the negotiation cop) and pretty Katie Holmes (as Stu's girlfriend) make the movie go in a crescendo of thrilling sensations and exquisite feelings that are a pre-requisite for a good movie with the purpose of ""Phone booth"".You will only be able to think after the movie. While you are watching, pay attention, so you won't loose anything.

603667,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JLQN,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 1]","""Isn't it funny? You hear a phone ring and it could be anybody. But a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?"" This particular line, when used outside of the context of the movie, appears to be nothing more than a rudimentary observation of a typical human inclination. However, this very same line when spoken by actor Keifer Sutherland, with his distinctly recognizable voice that has instilled fear into many a terrorist on TV's ""24"", takes on a creepy and ominous tone. With this one line of dialogue the movie, ""Phone Booth"", quickly kicks into high-gear and embarks upon a taut, tense thrill ride that will no doubt leave most audience members questioning whether or not they will answer a ringing public phone ever again.""Phone Booth"" focuses on one really bad day in the life of publicist Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) as his day goes from average to terrifying with one phone call. On the other end of the line is a deadly accurate sniper with a high-powered rifle aimed right at Stu. If Stu hopes to make it out of this ordeal alive he must do exactly what the caller dictates; if not, then his next breath could be his last.Making a movie where your main character is forced to spend the better part of 90 minutes stuck in essentially one spot would seem to not only be a hard sell to the actor or actress playing the role, but also to the director, supporting cast members, and any potential studio looking at bankrolling and/or distributing the film. I mean, seriously how can this premise actually sustain an audiences interest for that long, while remaining believable and on top of that, maintaining a high level of suspense? I suppose one could say that making a movie about a man alone on a deserted island with a volleyball for a companion is just as hard, if not harder to sell. Yet, that particular movie (""Cast Away"" for those that either don't recall or weren't aware) actually did well with both critics and audiences, proving that this type of film can work when done properly. All I can say is that clearly director Joel Schumacher (""A Time to Kill""), along with his cast, crew, and screenwriter, knew precisely what they were doing, thus creating an incredibly intense movie experience centered around one of the most mundane locations known to man... a phone booth.Written by Larry Cohen, a writer who may have an affinity for all things phone related (another movie he wrote was titled ""Cellular""), the story takes an interesting, albeit potentially boring and problematic, concept that could have been riddled with clich&eacute;s and unoriginality, and turns it into a sleek, inventive, fast-paced thriller. One particular aspect I enjoyed about this film's story is that it gives the audience enough of a taste of what Stu is like as a man prior to his ordeal, and then cleverly reveals more character details and flaws throughout the phone conversations. This method could have made the additional character development feel wedged into the story as an obvious means of exposition that would cause the pace to slow down; however, Cohen has weaved the details throughout the film in a way that never feels forced or unnatural within the context of the various phone calls.Another aspect of the story that worked really well (and increased the tension for the audience), was the realism inherent in the story. The fact that the bulk of the movie takes place within such an ordinary and mundane setting, like a phone booth, makes what is occurring all the more frightening because it actually could happen to one us. The best scares movies have ever given to audiences almost always revolve around events and/or settings that most of us either encounter or potentially could in our normal day-to-day lives. It is the familiarity of the surroundings and the realistic nature of the threat in ""Phone Booth"" that amplifies our dread to a much greater degree than anything most horror films can ever hope to achieve.Headlining this relatively small primary cast of characters is the ever-capable actor Colin Farrell (""American Outlaws""). Colin has proven over the course of several films during his relatively short career that he is an extremely talented actor and one that can hold his own with the biggest stars in the business. To my knowledge, ""Phone Booth"" is the first movie in which Colin must carry the lion's share of the film's workload alone. As with any actor or actress, a film such as this will test just how skilled an individual they truly are. With Colin's stellar performance in this movie he easily proves his worth to not only audiences, but critics as well.Alongside Colin in the supporting roles for the film are actors Forest Whitaker (""Phenomenon"") and Keifer Sutherland (TV's ""24""). Forest Whitaker brings more depth and believability to his character than the typical one-dimensional take the script seemed to provide. It is Whitaker's warmth that exudes from the character's initial conversations in the movie that makes him more relatable and balances out the otherwise cold and unforgiving nature of the rest of the police force depicted in the film.Keifer Sutherland delivers one of the most chilling villainous portrayals in modern cinema, at least in my opinion. What's most impressive about this performance is that it was acted predominantly through voice-over or in this case, phone calls. Surprisingly, this approach for showcasing the film's main antagonist didn't weaken the portrayal one bit. It is quite an achievement for an actor to make his presence feared throughout an entire movie without being seen for a majority of the duration. Keifer's gruff and menacing voice work in this film is unsettling enough, but his character's nonchalant approach to what he's doing is perhaps the most terrifying of all. Nothing is more disturbing than a villain that believes he or she is justified in whatever actions they may take, and Keifer's performance absolutely personifies that frame of mind.Lastly, actresses Radha Mitchell (""Man on Fire"") and Katie Holmes (""Batman Begins"") are left with little more to do than just look good on camera and provide some added tension to a couple of moments within the film. Between the two, Radha's character of Kelly, Stu's wife, is given a few brief moments of development and importance within the film; however, even then her scenes really didn't add all that much to the proceedings. Truth be told, I thought both actresses' characters, or at least Katie's character of Pam, could have been left out of the story and only be referred to in the conversations without sacrificing any of the intensity or excitement. In the end, both roles felt like nothing more than afterthoughts within the script.With a screenplay rife with tension, solid performances from the cast especially star Colin Farrell, and a real world setting that makes the whole ordeal all the more startling to the audience; ""Phone Booth"" is an excellent thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.""Phone Booth"" is rated R for pervasive language, brief violence, and sexual references.",4,One Wrong Answer Could Mean the End of Your Life...,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,7091,"[""n't"", 'funny', 'hear', 'phone',

Sadly, I never got a chance to see this film in the theaters as my schedule just wouldn't permit it. Flash forward:I rented this on dvd today with renewed excitement in finally seeing it. I was not disappointed. First off, I have to say that this movie has one of the most original plot lines I've seen in quite some time. And it's pulled off rather well. I never thought I could watch a movie that 98% of the film only takes place in one place (the phone booth of course) and be totally hooked the whole time. Very suspenseful, the movie comes off tense and nerve racking. The acting from Colin Ferrell and Kiefer Sutherland (the voice) is top drawer. An excellent script and excellent directing make up this thrilling (I assume - low budget) sleeper. Even though the whole movie took place in a phone booth - I didn't find myself bored once.My only gripe with the film, and the only reason why it didn't get 4 1/2 stars with me is I thought the ending could have been a little better. Don't get me wrong, it's good and satisfying, but the VERY end (I don't want to give away any spoilers for people who haven't seen it, so I'll just say, the AMBULANCE scene) could have been a little more creative.Overall, an excellent little film that I think deserves much praise.

Bernabo,"[0, 0]","In &quot;Phone Booth&quot; a fast-talking, two-timing Broadway press agent named Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) stops at his regular phone booth to call the young wannabee actress he wants to be his mistress (Katie Holmes) so that it does not show up on his cell phone bill where his wife can see the number.  But as soon as he hangs up--and refuses delivery of a pizza--there is a second phone call and a voice telling him what to do and what to say or else he is going to be shot.  Everyone should know the situation from the trailers and recognizes the voice on the other end of the phone as belonging to Keifer Sutherland, which is enough to take the situation very seriously.  Stu takes a bit longer to be persuaded and by then he is into this situation so deep that there looks like there is no hope of ever getting out of it.&quot;Phone Booth&quot; is only 81 minutes long, which makes sense since Stu gets himself into this situation pretty quickly and since the intensity is on high for almost the entire film.  This is not a film where you try to figure out what is really going on and why the voice on the other end of the phone is playing out this twisted little game with Stu.  After all, can you really believe anything said by somebody who is holding a gun on you?  What the voice wants does not matter.  The question is how many people are going to be dead when this one is over.  The motivation is secondary in a thriller such as this one.At first I thought that Sutherland's voice work is too good, because director Joel Schumacher does not filter the voice through a phone so that we hear it the way Stu would.  Instead we hear Sutherland's voice clearer than we hear Farrell's.  But then it dawned on me that doing this was to help force the viewer more into the perspective of a voyeur.  After all, since we do not know where the sniper is which means that any and all camera shots could be his perspective.In the final analysis, what makes this film work for me is the character of Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker), the cop who shows up to take charge of the situation and tries to find out what is going on instead of jumping to conclusions.  As was the case in &quot;Panic Room,&quot; I very much appreciated the idea that there are smart cops out there who do their jobs the way they should be done.  What really saves &quot;Phone Booth&quot; from being a two-dimensional film is when Ramey turns the dyad into a triad.",4,"If you hear a pay phone ringing, just leave it alone...",1057881600,"07 11, 2003",2003,2440,"['quot', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'quot', 'fast-talking', 'two-timing', 'Broadway', 'press', 'agent', 'named', 'Stu', 'Shepard', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'regular', 'phone', 'booth', 'call', 'young', 'wannabee', 'actress', 'be', 'mistress', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'cell', 'phone', 'bill', 'where', 'wife', 'can', 'see', 'number', 'as', 'soon', 'up', 'delivery', 'pizza', 'second', 'phone', 'call', 'voice', 'telling', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'say', 'else', 'going', 'be', 'shot', 'Everyone', 'should', 'know', 'situation', 'trailers', 'voice', 'other', 'end', 'phone', 'belonging', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'enough', 'take', 'situation', 'very', 'seriously', 'Stu', 'bit', 'longer', 'be', 'persuaded', 'then', 'situation', 'so', 'deep', 'hope', 'ever', 'getting', 'it.', 'quot', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'quot', 'only', '81', 'minutes', 'long', 'sense', 'Stu', 'situation', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'intensity', 'high', 'almost', 'entire', 'film', 'not', 'film', 'where', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'why', 'voice', 'other', 'end', 'phone', 'playing', 'out', 'twisted', 'little', 'game', 'Stu', 'can', 'really', 'believe', 'anything', 'said', 'somebody', 'who', 'holding', 'gun', 'What', 'voice', 'not', 'matter', 'question', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'dead', 'when', 'one', 'motivation', 'secondary', 'thriller', 'such', 'one.At', 'first', 'thought', 'Sutherland', 'voice', 'work', 'too', 'good', 'director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'not', 'filter', 'voice', 'phone', 'so', 'hear', 'way', 'Stu', 'would', 'Instead', 'hear', 'Sutherland', 'voice', 'clearer', 'hear', 'Farrell', 'then', 'dawned', 'doing', 'was', 'help', 'force', 'viewer', 'more', 'perspective', 'voyeur', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'sniper', 'camera', 'shots', 'could', 'be', 'perspective.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'what', 'film', 'work', 'character', 'Captain', 'Ramey', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'cop', 'who', 'up', 'take', 'charge', 'situation', 'tries', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'instead', 'jumping', 'conclusions', 'was', 'case', 'quot', 'Panic', 'Room', 'quot', 'very', 'much', 'appreciated', 'idea', 'are', 'smart', 'cops', 'who', 'do', 'jobs', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'What', 'really', 'quot', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'quot', 'being', 'two-dimensional', 'film', 'when', 'Ramey', 'dyad', 'triad']",N/A

The plot, while promising, is too contrived and fails in its execution. It is saved from total failure only by the excellent performances given by Colin Ferrell and Kiefer Sutherland. Their performances, however, are not enough to make this film any more than a mediocre one.Colin Ferrell plays the role of Stu Shepard, a guy from the Bronx, who is a fast talking, self-important publicist for those celebrities who want to be more important than they are or deserve to be. His wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) is a beautiful young woman. Yet, she is not enough for the adrenaline charged Stu, who is lusting after another young woman, a beautiful and aspiring actress named Pamela (Katie Holmes), who has no idea Stu is married.When Stu enters a phone booth in midtown Manhattan one day to call Pamela, he answers the phone when it rings and gets a call that will change his life forever and bring about some self-realization. It seems that out mystery caller, played with effectively creepy resonance by Kiefer Sutherland, has had his sights on Stu for some time.

Although he's considered more a hunk than a great actor, the diversity of his work is beginning to show that this is a leading man who approaches his work like a character actor.  The evil dastardly guy in &quot;Daredevil&quot; is so different from the prideful pompous character in &quot;Hart's War&quot; with &quot;S.W.A.T.,&quot; &quot;The Recruit,&quot; &quot;Minority Report,&quot; and &quot;American Outlaws&quot; falling somewhere in between.None of those films prepared me for the amazing climactic moment in the phone booth where he confesses his sins at the top of his lungs.  The film builds to that powerful display.  It really is Farrell's golden moment, breathtaking performance.Ironically enough, in &quot;Phone Booth&quot; you have Farrell, an Irishman, married to Radha Mitchell as Kelly, an Australian, both sounding like authentic Yankees.  Kiefer Sutherland is eerie as the phone caller.  Forest Whitaker is wonderfully moving as Capt. Ramey, as he was in &quot;Phenomenon&quot; &amp; &quot;Panic Room.&quot;  Dawson's Creek's Katie Holmes does a nice job in her little cameo.  I also loved the loudmouthed prostitute, Texada I believe is her name.Director Joel Schumaker directed Farrell in his breakout film &quot;Tigerland&quot; and also in &quot;Veronica Guerin.&quot;  So they obviously have a good and wonderful working relationship.  (It'll be interesting to see what Schumaker does with &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; and how Colin Farrell does as Alexander the Great this year.)  I like the fact that the film is 80 minutes.  It doesn't belabor the point, doesn't drag, &amp; builds with a deadly precision.  I've often thought that this could be a film that would lend itself to adaptation to the stage.

It kept me totally involved with my eyes glued to the screen for every one of its 88 minutes, which seemed to fly by in an instant.  Funny thing is that this is a simple film, with bascially only one scene and just a few excellent actors.  I loved it.Colin Farrell is cast as a fast-talking publicist who we first meet on the streets of New York, doing elaborate deals and telling lies into his cell phone.  He's full of ego and thinks he's on top of the world.  However, every day at the same time, he stops into a phone booth to call a young actress who he is romancing.  She doesn't know he's married, and he doesn't tell her.  When he's ready to leave the booth, the phone rings.  He picks it up.  Big mistake.Now we hear the voice of a sniper who's in one of the buildings near the booth.  He wants the publicist to confess his infidelities to his wife and girlfriend and threatens to kill him if he doesn't follow instructions.  What follows is an intense drama in which the tension never lets up.  The screenplay by Larry Cohen is tightly conceived and there isn't a wasted word or a superfluous character.  And Colin Farrell shines in his role, which has to be an actor's dream.Kiefer Sutherland is cast as the caller and Forrest Whitiker as the cop who is in charge of the police action on the scene.  Radha Mitchell is cast as the wife, Katie Holmes is the girlfriend.  And one of the best scenes in the film is when a trio of hookers demand to use the phone booth.  All the acting is excellent.  And the New York City atmosphere is definitely authentic.I can't say enough good things about this film.  It even has a moral to it.  Highly recommended.",5,The phone rings.

After a while, I was just rooting for our mysterious antagonist to just end everbody's miserable life.Here's the premise.  A slimeball of a publicist wheels and deals his way through life by playing upon the fears of those who are afraid to be upstaged by others.Every day he calls an aspiring actress from a payphone in order to keep the secret from his wife.  Ooops, did I give away too much?  Considering the director was Schumacher, it's not all surprising that he sledge-hammers the obvious into our heads by having our character take the wedding ring off and call from a pay phone when his cell phone would obviously do.  I'm just surprised that there weren't up-close shots of tight pants...sorry, that was his astonishing work that nearly killed the Batman franchise.I digress.A pointless scene involving a pizza guy (except maybe to trick an audience with an IQ less than 50 into thinking that HE may be our menacing killer) interrupts our ""hero"".Then the phone rings and a sniper comes on board and practically recites the premise of the movie almost as if he was reading directly from the script instead of acting it.The rest of the movie kind of goes like this (spoilers...yeah, ok...not really):Stu (our hero):  Who is this?Random hooker:  Get off the phone!Shooter:  Tell her to go away.Stu:  Go away!Pimp:  Get off the phone!Shooter:  Tell him to go away.Stu:  Go away!Pimp attacks Stu.  Pimp gets shot.  Cops arrivePolice captain:  What's going on?Shooter:  Tell him to go away!Stu:  Go away!Then the rest of the film kind of dissolves into this:Shooter:  Tell the police captain something degrading.Stu:  No!Shooter:  Do it or I'll shoot him.Stu:  Ok!Shooter:  Do something stupid like reaching for something above the booth.Stu:  No!Shooter:  Do it or I'll shoot your wife!Stu:  Ok!Shooter:  Tell your wife what a bad man you are.Stu:  No!Shooter:  Do it or I'll shoot your wife or that actress you want to sleep with!Stu:  Ok!(wash...rinse...repeat).I won't give away the ending except to say that Stu is now a reformed individual who is now looking for the guy who played him, Colin Farrell, to ask him if he could be in a movie involving more than one set.Ok, granted the movie's premise doesn't allow you to get beyond the phone booth, but let's face it.  Once the cops show up, is there truly any suspense?  Once the sniper shoots someone else (even if it IS someone Stu cares about), wouldn't the farce be up when they realize that Stu DOESN'T have a weapon and someone goes down?It's a pity.  I like Kiefer Sutherland (a voice that is readily identifiable in the movie), Colin, as well as Forrest Whitaker and their combined acting talents could have served up something considerably substantial.  But a weak story and even weaker director (let's face it - Batman Forever as well as Batman & Robin showcase Schumacher's best talents...yes, I'm being sarcastic) ""do not a good movie make.""And what kind of idiot dials *69 from a payphone?Pass by this movie on your way to buy something more tangible....",1,I rented it and I still want my money back...,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,3261,"['Even', 'write', 'hard', 'not', 'giggle', 'especially', 'considering', 'only', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'be', 'poor', 'cop', 'Whitaker', 'who', 'doing', 'best', 'restrain', 'others', 'shooting', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'while', 'was', 'just', 'rooting', 'mysterious', 'antagonist', 'just', 'end', 'everbody', 'miserable', 'life.Here', 'premise', 'slimeball', 'publicist', 'wheels', 'deals', 'way', 'life', 'playing', 'fears', 'who', 'are', 'afraid', 'be', 'upstaged', 'others.Every', 'day', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'payphone', 'order', 'keep', 'secret', 'wife', 'Ooops', 'did', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'Considering', 'director', 'was', 'Schumacher', 'not', 'surprising', 'obvious', 'heads', 'having', 'character', 'take', 'wedding', 'ring', 'call', 'pay', 'phone', 'when', 'cell', 'phone', 'would', 'obviously', 'do', ""'m"", 'just', 'surprised', 'were', ""n't"", 'up-close', 'shots', 'tight', 'pants', 'sorry', 'was', 'astonishing', 'work', 'nearly', 'killed', 'Batman', 'franchise.I', 'digress.A', 'pointless', 'scene', 'involving', 'pizza', 'guy', 'maybe', 'trick', 'audience', 'IQ', 'less', '50', 'thinking', 'HE', 'may', 'be', 'menacing', 'killer', 'hero', 'phone', 'rings', 'sniper', 'board', 'practically', 'premise', 'movie', 'almost', 'was', 'reading', 'directly', 'script', 'instead', 'acting', 'it.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'kind', 'spoilers', 'yeah', 'ok', 'not', 'really', 'Stu', 'hero', 'Who', 'Random', 'hooker', 'Get', 'off', 'phone', 'Shooter', 'Tell', 'go', 'away.Stu', 'Go', 'away', 'Pimp', 'Get', 'off', 'phone', 'Shooter', 'Tell', 'go', 'away.Stu', 'Go', 'away', 'Pimp', 'Stu', 'Pimp', 'shot', 'Cops', 'arrivePolice', 'captain', 'What', 'going', 'Shooter', 'Tell', 'go', 'away', 'Stu', 'Go', 'away', 'Then', 'rest', 'film', 'kind', 'dissolves', 'Shooter', 'Tell', 'police', 'captain', 'something', 'degrading.Stu', 'Shooter', 'Do', ""'ll"", 'shoot', 'him.Stu', 'Ok', 'Shooter', 'Do', 'something', 'stupid', 'reaching', 'something', 'booth.Stu', 'Shooter', 'Do', ""'ll"", 'shoot', 'wife', 'Stu', 'Ok', 'Shooter', 'Tell', 'wife', 'what', 'bad', 'man', 'are.Stu', 'Shooter', 'Do', ""'ll"", 'shoot', 'wife', 'actress', 'want', 'sleep', 'Stu', 'Ok', 'wash', 'rinse', 'repeat', '.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'say', 'Stu', 'now', 'reformed', 'individual', 'who', 'now', 'looking', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'ask', 'could', 'be', 'movie', 'involving', 'more', 'one', 'set.Ok', 'granted', 'movie', 'premise', ""n't"", 'allow', 'get', 'phone', 'booth', 'let', 'face', 'cops', 'show', 'up', 'there', 'truly', 'suspense', 'sniper', 'someone', 'else', 'even', 'someone', 'Stu', 'would', ""n't"", 'farce', 'be', 'up', 'when', 'realize', 'Stu', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'have', 'weapon', 'someone', 'down', 'pity', 'like', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'voice', 'readily', 'identifiable', 'movie', 'Colin', 'as', 'well', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'combined', 'acting', 'talents', 'could', 'have', 'served', 'up', 'something', 'considerably', 'substantial', 'weak', 'story', 'even', 'weaker', 'director', 'let', 'face', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'as', 'well', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'showcase', 'Schumacher', 'best', 'talents', 'yes', ""'m"", 'being', 'sarcastic', 'do', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'make', 'what', 'kind', 'idiot', 'dials', '*69', 'payphone', 'Pass', 'movie', 'way', 'buy', 'something', 'more', 'tangible']",N/A

603688,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00005JLQN,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[0, 0]","Phone Booth is a real nailbiter. An genuine edge-of-the-seat roller coaster ride brimming with non-stop suspence.It certainly isn't the deepest of thrillers, and it has flaws in logic and presentation, but the idea behind it is a tension grabber: A man answers a phone in a phone booth only to be told that if he hangs up, he'll be shot by a gunman lurking in a nearby window. The man is Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell), an obnoxious New York press agent. Stu, who is married, regularly uses this same phone booth to call a young client and would-be girlfriend (Katie Holmes, who isn't given much to do) because he doesn't want the number to show up on his cell-phone bill. But the calls - and lives - of those who use the phone booth somehow are being monitored by a man with a vengeance (Kiefer Sutherland).Screenwriter Larry Cohen (It's Alive) has created a situation that so tense, you can overlook the thematic overreaching. Stu is forced into one double bind after another, with the Caller forcing him to make comments to his wife (Radha Mitchell) on the phone and to neighborhood strippers and cops on the street that only bolster the perception that Stu may be a gun-wielding menace. Director Joel Schumacher and Cohen keep the action taut and believable within its own self-contained world.

It suffers from too many lapses in logic; in fact, it is not at all plausible and depends primarily on style over substance. Still, it a fine piece of filmmaking that stands head and shoulders above recent high profile thrillers such as ""Panic Room"". Its best assets are a superlative performance by Colin Farrell, brilliant cinematography, and a fast pace that never once meanders into superfluous territory.The story is simple: A sleazy publicist named Stu [Farrell] is walking with his assistant around midtown Manhattan one afternoon. Both are on cell phones wheeling and dealing. Dismissing his assistant, Stu makes his way to a phone booth, one of the few left in that part of New York. As usual, he is there to call the girl he wants to sleep with. By using a pay phone, he can avoid his wife's seeing the phone number when the cell phone bill arrives. After he hangs up, the pay phone rings. He answers, and a man's voice informs him that Stu better do everything the man tells him to do because the caller has a high powered rifle aimed at him. At first Stu thinks it's a bad joke. It isn't, and what follows is an intense and clever cat and mouse game.Farrell is able to give the unsavory main character enough humanity to make us care about what happens to him. Kiefer Sutherland does well in an interesting role. Playing the Caller, he is not seen until the end of the movie, and then only for a few seconds.Those who expect a thriller worthy of Hitchcock will be disappointed.

Plus, Stu wasn't exactly having a hot, clothes ripping affair with Pam (Katie Holmes) now was he? He was merely fantasising about her - heaven forbid, he should be sent to hell for that! What guy doesn't fantasise about another girl when he's married/engaged/dating/single?I wasn't sure about Kiefer Sutherland as the sniper. What was the point in him over the phone all the time?

Hind ""daria_m""","[0, 1]","In a movie that's one part ""Scream"" and one part ""Seven,"" Colin Farrell plays Stu, a dishonest publicist who answers an unlucky call in a phone booth.  After calling a young actress (Katie Holmes) he fantasizes about having an affair with, the phone rings again and curious Stu feels compelled to answer.  On the other end is a sniper who is targeting Stu for being a lying, manipulative person.  He keeps Stu glued to the booth and threatens to kill his wife, would-be mistress, and various onlookers and cops if he does not confess his wrongdoings.This is an interesting concept, focusing all of the action around very little action at all.  But alas, director Joel Schumacher could only take the claustrophobia of the booth so far, leaving a quick, predictable, and unsatisfying ending to the film.  I really wanted there to be something else that Stu was hiding, a deeper secret along with his usual discretions.  But it didn't happen.  It kind of makes you wonder why the sniper chose Stu when there were inarguably more evil criminals prowling the streets.  Guess it was a case of wrong place at the wrong time.Farrell's great acting make the movie watchable.  He's becoming the king of movie accents as he tackles a Bronx Italian one for this movie.  His portrayals of anger and fear are indeed powerful.  Keifer Sutherland, always a great bad guy, lends creepiness as the voice of the sniper, and Forest Whitaker is great as Captain Ramey.  Holmes was wasted, as she only had one scene of dialogue.  I think a lower-profile actress could have taken her place (to at least save money).  Watching Radha Mitchell as Stu's wife Kelly made me cringe.  Bad actress alert!  Her delivery of lines was SO wooden!

Now he is in his 3rd film this year, Joel Schumaker's (""Tigerland"") ""Phone Booth"" a thriller said to have had Hitchcock interested in filming it 30 years ago. Hitchcock did have some experience with filming in small spaces and in long extended shots in his terrific ""The Rope.""Farrell plays Stu Shepard: cad, smart aleck, tough-as-nails, philandering, publicist with a wife and a girlfriend. He makes one mistake that no New Yorker ever would, though: he answers a ringing public booth phone. (The film, though set in NYC was shot in Downtown Los Angeles) This begins Shepard's""relationship"" with a hidden sniper (Keifer Sutherland). And this sniper is not out for just creating mayhem in the big City; he's looking for retribution. He has specifically chosen Shepard to call on the carpet. He's looking for Shepard to make amends for his wicked ways. And therein lies the problem with this film.What seemed to de developing into a fun, jazzy, quickly paced Thriller becomes a tale of contrition and movie moralizing: See What happens to you when you are not a Nice Guy??With all that said though, Farrell breaks out of his normal smart-alecky, bad boy, expertly composed mold in one hyper-emotional scene comparable to Liza Minnelli's phone scene in ""The Sterile Cuckoo"" or Chris O'Donnell's Riverfront scene in ""Men Don't Leave."" This scene is so emotionally open and psychologically true that we finally get a peek, I think into Farrell's soul: heretofore something he has deigned to concealbehind his macho bravado.At one hour and 24 minutes, ""Phone Booth"" cannot hold all the sanctimonious moralizing that Schumacher has slathered on. And more importantly, had he stuck to his initial guns of just going for the thrill, this film could have been a taut, fun B-Movie Thriller in the class with the best.

We're supposed to focus on the fact that the phone booth is the remnant of a bygone era, about to disappear forever because it is too slow, too old, too calcified with the advent of mobile phones. Instead, all I could focus on was how this was so not New York City.It's what people who don't live anywhere NYC think of it though, complete with hookers screaming at people. And that's who the movie is for - folks who don't actually live in the city.  It's also very much a pre-9/11 film.  For anyone who lives in NYC, the police response in Phone Booth is an insult to the officers who protect the city every day.If Phone Booth fails on a purely geographic level, the rest of the film's burden is squarely on the shoulders of the lead.  It would make a lot of sense for that lead to be a New Yorker, but it's understandable that the director might cast a wider net.  You'd think though, that he'd at least try for an actor who is a U.S. citizen.But no, we get Colin Farrell as Stu Shepard.  Farrell can't fake a New York accent to save his one-dimensional character's life. Worse, Shepard is a stereotype - he's what people think publicists are like.  So Shepard's a bed-hopping, money-grubbing, smooth-talking ""operator"" who makes connections, breaks hearts, and gets it done, baby.  He is a walking, talking archetype in a cardboard city backdrop.That leaves our villain, the silky voice on the phone.  Kiefer Sutherland's purr is perfect for this part, although he seems a little too fond of cocking his rifle without ever un-cocking it. That's not enough to save the preposterous plot, which is a deconstruction of a slimy human being with the ever-present threat of violence. Sutherland's character creates a moral quandary by forcing Stu to choose between his mistress (blank cipher Katie Holmes) and his long-suffering wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell).The only other relief comes in Forest Whitaker as Captain Ed Ramey, who shows some modicum of introspection and character development. Ramey stands head-and-shoulders above all the other characters because they're all so unlikable. The sniper doesn't even seem to have a motive - he's more the righteous voice of the audience's moral rage against ""city people.""  We're meant to sympathize with him as he strikes down pimps and publicists, but really this is about making the audience feel better about not living in a big city.And that's who this movie is aimed at.  If you think that New York City is filled with pimps, prostitutes, and publicists, that snipers are lurking from every window, and that New York's Finest are incompetent boobs, this movie is a passable thriller.  For the rest of us?  It's a pale imitation of the real thing.",2,This is SO not New Yawk,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,3722,"['once', 'awhile', 'see', 'movie', 'particular', 'horrible', 'circumstance', 'wonder', 'had', 'actually', 'experienced', 'what', 'happened', 'screen', 'would', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Do', 'war', 'movies', 'seem', 'thrilling', ""'ve"", 'been', 'war', 'Are', 'movies', 'terrorism', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'entertaining', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'been', 'victim', 'movie', 'phone', 'booth', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'seem', 'authentic', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'one', 'hook', 'phone', 'booth', 'one-act', 'play', 'camera', 'singularly', 'focused', 'star', 'fifty', 'percent', 'film', 'location', 'other', 'fifty', 'percent', 'actor', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'mess', 'up', 'astounding', 'ways.The', 'first', 'problem', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'was', ""n't"", 'filmed', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'not', 'New', 'York', 'City', ""n't"", 'feel', 'New', 'York', 'City', ""n't"", 'look', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'big', 'honking', 'LA', 'bus', 'background', 'one', 'point', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'focus', 'fact', 'phone', 'booth', 'remnant', 'bygone', 'era', 'disappear', 'forever', 'too', 'slow', 'too', 'old', 'too', 'calcified', 'advent', 'mobile', 'phones', 'Instead', 'could', 'focus', 'was', 'how', 'was', 'so', 'not', 'New', 'York', 'City.It', 'what', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'anywhere', 'NYC', 'think', 'complete', 'hookers', 'screaming', 'people', 'who', 'movie', 'folks', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'live', 'city', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'pre-9/11', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'NYC', 'police', 'response', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'insult', 'officers', 'who', 'protect', 'city', 'day.If', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'purely', 'geographic', 'level', 'rest', 'film', 'burden', 'squarely', 'shoulders', 'lead', 'would', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'lead', 'be', 'New', 'Yorker', 'understandable', 'director', 'might', 'cast', 'wider', 'net', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'least', 'try', 'actor', 'who', 'U.S.', 'citizen.But', 'no', 'get', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Stu', 'Shepard', 'Farrell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fake', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'save', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'life', 'Worse', 'Shepard', 'stereotype', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'publicists', 'are', 'So', 'Shepard', 'bed-hopping', 'money-grubbing', 'smooth-talking', 'operator', 'who', 'connections', 'breaks', 'hearts', 'done', 'baby', 'walking', 'talking', 'archetype', 'cardboard', 'city', 'backdrop.That', 'villain', 'silky', 'voice', 'phone', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'purr', 'perfect', 'part', 'little', 'too', 'fond', 'cocking', 'rifle', 'ever', 'un-cocking', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'preposterous', 'plot', 'deconstruction', 'slimy', 'human', 'being', 'ever-present', 'threat', 'violence', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'moral', 'quandary', 'forcing', 'Stu', 'choose', 'mistress', 'blank', 'cipher', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Kelly', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', '.The', 'only', 'other', 'relief', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Captain', 'Ed', 'Ramey', 'who', 'modicum', 'introspection', 'character', 'development', 'Ramey', 'head-and-shoulders', 'other', 'characters', ""'re"", 'so', 'unlikable', 'sniper', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'have', 'motive', 'more', 'righteous', 'voice', 'audience', 'moral', 'rage', 'city', 'people', ""'re"", 'meant', 'sympathize', 'down', 'pimps', 'publicists', 'really', 'making', 'audience', 'feel', 'better', 'not', 'living', 'big', 'city.And', 'who', 'movie', 'aimed', 'think', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'filled', 'pimps', 'prostitutes', 'publicists', 'snipers', 'are', 'lurking', 'window', 'New', 'York', 'Finest', 'are', 'incompetent', 'boobs', 'movie', 'passable', 'thriller', 'rest', 'pale', 'imitation', 'real', 'thing']",N/A

Unfortunately for him, a high tech sniper with a penchant for morality judgements is all too familiar with Colin's life and activities and has chosen the phone booth as the place for Colin's redemption or death.  For the bulk of the movie, Colin is trapped in the phone booth between the imposing forces of the New York City Police (who believe him to be the murderer of an abusive pimp); and the  sniper that threatens to shoot him (as he did the pimp) should he attempt to leave the phone booth.  The voice of the shooter does not belong to a lunatic that's merely looking to score an innocent victim or two.  He's studied Colin, decided that he's unworthy of living his successful life and determined to reform him or remove him from life's mortal coil.We see just enough of Colin's character in action during the first ten minutes or so to fully understand that this is one self-absorbed, manipuplative jerk of a human being.  But that somewhat begs the question as to whether or not his misdeeds truly warrant the forfeiture of his life and/or the murder of two others.  That's the ultimate weakness of a film that aspires to be a powerful psychodrama but only barely reaches the level of a brisk, lightweight thriller.Forest Whitaker lends a powerful presence as the police captain that tries to talk Colin out of the booth.  But his talents are underutilized by a script that gives any worthy dialogue to Sutherland's malevolent voice of persecution.The filmmakers at least make an attempt to answer the obvious questions like why is an old-fashioned phone booth still standing on an NYC street, and why can't Colin use his cell phone to call get help or explain his predicament to the police.  But in the end, questions remain, like why target a philandering publicist, when there are plenty of other evil types that are more deserving of a bullet to the head?  So just forget the serious morality and grab a bucket of popcorn.

Put the receiver down, and I will kill you, the sniper tells him, taking out a guy or two on the street to prove his point (and making it look like Farrell did it in the bargain).

He stops at that phone booth at the same time every day to call a young client with whom he likes to flirt. One day, as he is finishing up his calls, someone calls him. The phone in the booth rings. Stu answers. The caller doesn't identify himself, but asks that Stu listen while the caller telephones Stu's young client and reveals that Stu is married. The caller also insists that Stu telephone his wife, Kelly (Radha Mitchell), and confess his emotional infidelity to her. When Stu refuses, the caller demonstrates his power by shooting a toy that is on the ground next to the phone booth with a high powered rifle. And the game is on. The caller says that Stu is being punished for lying to his clients, colleagues and his wife. If Stu does not confess his sins and do exactly as the caller says, the caller will kill either Stu or a bystander. When the caller kills a man who is trying to pull Stu from the phone booth, it attracts the attention of the police, who blame Stu for the shooting. Police Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) is the senior officer on the scene, and he would like very much to avoid shooting Stu, who refuses to leave the phone booth. Stu must try to communicate to the police that there is a sniper holding him hostage while doing everything he can to prevent the sniper from claiming more victims.""Phone Booth"" has an interesting premise. And Colin Farrell does a good job of conveying the extraordinary stress that Stu in under as he must negotiate for the lives of the bystanders while his own life is constantly threatened by both the sniper and the police. Farrell's performance is the stand-out element of this film., and I recommend ""Phone Booth"" to Colin Farrell fans for this reason. The ability of the caller to pull off such an elaborate game of extortion is a less credible. But what I really don't like about ""Phone Booth"" is its production. Director Joel Schumacher's tastes seem to have shifted from the height of overproduced extravagance in 1997's ""Batman and Robin"" to bargain basement production values in ""Phone Booth"". This movie just shouts ""cheap"". And since the production is so self-consciously chintzy, Schumacher thinks he can pass that off as style. Being able to make a good film on a small budget is great. Making a mediocre film that looks like it was made on a shoestring isn't. And what's with those blue filters? This film is blue. Ever since those bluish automobile advertisements became popular a few years ago, Hollywood has embraced the cyan cast far too widely. Even the grungiest neighborhoods in New York don't sport odd color casts, and who would want them to?",3,Nice performance.

Colin Farrell was framed becasue the guy had put a gun in the phone booth earlier. The cops come he does what the guy tells him to do and he lied to the police by saying he was on the phone with his pyschratrist. The cops later find out who he's talking to and they try to stop him. The guy shot Colin and then framed and killed the pizza guy.This was a great movie and I left a lot of the movie out so you can see it for yourself.

603708,A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ,B00005JLQN,"Mr. JKW ""jkw""","[7, 15]","Phone Booth is easily one of the most intense 80 minutes in film history.  Word to the wise, never pick up a ringing public telephone.THE STORY:Stu Shephard (Colin Farrell) is a Manhattan publicist guilty of a few things:  being a somewhat dishonest businessman and lustfully fawning after a young actress, Pamela (Katie Holmes) despite being married.  Little does he know that someone's been watching him lust after Pam.  When Stu enters his Manhattan phone booth to talk to Pam (as has been his ritual) he's taken hostage by a psychotic sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) who's determined to make ""bad men"" repent for their unrighteous actions.  Things go from bad to worse for Stu when he's accused of shooting a street pimp from the booth and the swat team arrives to take him into custody.  Unfortunately for him, the sniper won't let him leave the booth till he confesses his sins.THE COOL THINGS:It amazes me that the entire movie takes place on a street corner in a phone booth - all 80 minutes of this movie.  It amazes me further that the movie manages to remain engaging and enthralling.  The suspense maintained by the movie is very reminiscent of Sutherland's other current big profile work, namely 24.The sniper character voiced by Sutherland is easily the highlight of the movie.  The sniper is obviously a psychotic stalker and killer.  However, he is also at the same time an avenging angel with an odd sense of justice.BEST SCENES:Well, quite honestly, the whole movie is basically one big scene at the phone booth.

603709,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JLQN,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[2, 2]","For a couple of years now (since Tigerland) Colin Farrell has been much vaunted as the next big thing but with the exception of his supporting role in Speilberg's Minority Report, Farrell's subsequent additions to his CV have hardly enhanced his reputation. Movies such as Hart's War and The Recruit have left both audiences and critics somewhat underwhelmed, whilst the release of Phone Booth was much delayed due to the real life Washington snipers mindless killing of innocent people.So what of Phone Booth: Is it any good and does Colin Farrell deserve the tag of next big thing?Farrell plays Stu Shepard a slimy, unscrupulous, and very small time, Manhattan PR man with a daily habit of using the same old fashioned phone booth to call a prospective client (Katie Holmes) with whom he is trying to start an affair with. After all he wouldn't want his wife to see a mobile phone bill listing calls to other women, would he? Enticed into picking up the ringing phone, Stu becomes trapped by an unseen sniper who tells him that he will be killed if he tries to leave the booth or puts down the phone. 'What do you want?' demands Stu,  'I want your complete attention' replies the sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) and not only does he get Stu's complete attention he gets the audiences too as we watch Stu unravel into a [weak] mess pleading for his life over the next seventy minutes.With his cocky charm, good looks and uncanny ability to mimic an American accent, Farrell is perfect for the part, which was at one point reportedly earmarked for Will Smith. The Dublin born actor appears to revel in playing the anti-hero forced into confessing his sins by the psycho sniper playing God in order to achieve some form of redemption. There are good supporting performances too from the likes of Forrest Whittaker as the cop in charge at the scene and in particular Kiefer Sutherland as the menacing assassin at the other end of the line.Written by veteran writer/producer/Director Larry Cohen and Directed by Joel Schumacher, responsible for the very lamentable Batman & Robin, Phone Booth is (in my humble opinion) a very exciting and claustrophobic edge of the seat thriller. Cohen's script and Schumacher's Direction keep the movie lean and tight, steadily cranking up the tension to new heights right up until the movies conclusion. Cohen's script is so ingenious in that it takes an old movie premise (the irresistible ringing phone that has to be answered and the anonymous caller) and gives it a new spin. It's almost hard to believe that this is the same Joel Schumacher responsible for the last two movies of the Batman franchise. Indeed this is very much a return to form for the man that brought us the urban thriller ""Falling Down"". Keeping you hooked throughout its (by current standards) relatively short running time, it is refreshing to see the old adage that less is sometimes more once again proved true...., this is top-drawer entertainment and the best thriller I've seen in a long while. There are certainly much worse ways to spend 81 minutes, so take my advice and give this one a try, I'm sure you wont regret it!!!

He'll never live down the embarassment of 'Batman & Robin' but since then he has had two films that are top notch productions. 'Tigerland' is one. This is the other. Schumacher and Colin Farrell reteam for the second time (Farrell also starred in 'Tigerland', his breakout role) and really ratchet up the tension with a free-fall thriller that goes for broke at a breakneck pace.Farrell plays Stu Sheppard, a fast-talking semi-sleazy New York publicist with a doting wife (Radha Mitchell from 'Pitch Black')and a wannabe starlet mistress (Katie Holmes) on the side. One day, as fate would of course have it, Stu picks the wrong phone booth to place a call and before he knows it, a cold and calculating sniper (Keifer Sutherland) has Stu trapped in the booth for his twisted amusement. Eventually the cops show up, headed by the cautious Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker playing himself). Will Stu get out of this crazy predicament? The answer is obvious if you watch a lot of movies, but getting there is pretty fun.The story moves incredibly fast at a brisk 80 minutes or so, stopping a scant few times to try to develop some character moments. Even though Stu is a creep, you still sympathize with him and his hopeless situation as he's forced to say and experience things that would cause most people to snap into a major nervous breakdown. There's no time for silly subplots or excess narrative, which is one of the film's strong points.The performances are at the very least pretty decent. There are some ham-fisted moments among the tension, mostly from Farrell, but he does do a nice job of carrying the picture since he's in virtually 99% of the movie. Keifer Sutherland is sufficiently menacing and acerbic as the mysterious sniper/caller, although he sometimes sounds like Jeremy Irons' character Scar from 'The Lion King'The ending is well done and doesn't lead to a silly action chase or dumb set-piece where the hero goes after the bad guy, which would have blown the whole movie completely. Congrats to Schumacher for making a small, claustrophobic film with some nice acting. It does have some silly dialogue at times, as well as a few lapses of logic, but it doesn't overstay its welcome and will remain known as a fast, cheap and rather effective exercise in small-scale suspense.Overall, I'd recommend 'Phone Booth' to anyone looking for a good time at the movies.

Shephard is an almost stereotypically flamboyant publicist living in New York with his estranged wife, Kelly, percolating a potentially adulterous relationship with a young actress played by Katie Holmes, and stringing along the most current of a long line of unpaid interns. ""The Caller"" observes Shepard calling Katie Holmes' character each day from a telephone booth so his wife will not be able to see the calls on his cellular telephone bill. Upon discovering the web of lies that Shepard's life consists of, ""The Caller"" one day calls the telephone booth while Shepard is in it and explains to him that if he hangs up, or leaves the booth, he will be shot and killed. Shepard's apparent monopolization of the booth, leads to several confrontations and eventually a police presence surrounding him. Several plot turns erupt in the due course of the film, and despite almost all of the events taking place in only one, very small set, the audience's attention is successfully grabbed and their tension constant even until the slightly surprising ending.'Phone Booth' is a surprisingly positive contribution to the world of film from one of the worst offenders in crimes against the cinema, Joel Schumacher, whose previous attempts at movies were such horrors asBad Company,Batman & Robin, andBatman Forever. Despite his train-wreck of a career previous to 'Phone Booth,' Schumacher pulls this film off very well indeed, besting the challenges of an unchanging set to bring us a very entertaining picture. Perhaps the only obvious possibilities for improvement are the introductory scenes, which are supposed to explain how prevalent and dominating telephones are to each of us, in spite of the fact that this is just so obvious to everyone, but Mr. Schumacher.

Rheubottom ""tarryrob""","[2, 2]","An innovative suspenseful thriller!Schumacher's latest outing PHONE BOOTH takes a familiar formula and applies some clever new spins. We begin with a stereotypical `Scream' like psycho killer (voice of Kiefer Sutherland) who loves to taunt and terrorize his victims via the telephone. However, Schumacher deviates from the standard psycho killer fare in intriguing ways. Firstly, our primary victim is male (Colin Farrell) not female. Rather than being trapped helpless and home alone, the victim is duped into answering a phone call in a busy New York City telephone booth. The killer then threatens to open fire with a high power rife unless Farrell (playing a New York City publicist) stays on the line and does everything he's told.Schumacher takes pains at the beginning of the film to paint Farrell's character as a lying, manipulative self-centered lowlife. Again, the director breaks with the stereotypical formula in which the killer's victims are innocents who draw the audiences' sympathy, by painting Farrell as a worm, Schumacher cleverly inverts the formula so that the audience actually enjoys watching the victim squirm.The killer tells Farrell he has set other victims up in the same manner and has killed before. To prove to Farrell he means business, he kills a bystander. This acts as a reality check both for Farrell and the audience - it's one thing to see a low life being made to squirm but quite another for the sniper to open fire on a crowded New York Street. The audience now expects Schumacher to start running up the body count. But the director again dashes audience expectation and turns the film primarily into a psychological thriller rather than the action suspense or slasher fare we've been led to expect. The camera and action focus almost exclusively on the phone booth (reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE) and the publicist's agony and humiliation as the killer forces him to stay in the booth, now surrounded by police, and carry out his twisted wishes upon threat of death. Unaware of the sniper's presence, the police think the publicist has the killed the bystander. Farrel's character must continue playing the killer's deadly game in hopes he can somehow tip the police before either they, or the killer, end his life. Schumacher caps the film with a nice (though not totally unpredictable) twist ending.

603738,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JLQN,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","A terrific idea for a movie.  A guy answers a phone call from a phone booth he has just finished using.  Turns out the caller is a sniper with a gun trained on him, and if poor phone booth user doesn't do everything he says, sniper will kill him or others.Colin Farrell plays the ""answerer.""  He's a fast-talking, oily PR guy who is totally self-absorbed, and also interested in making time with Katie Holmes, even though he already has a loving, attractive wife (Radha Mitchell).  The sniper (voice VERY well by Kiefer Sutherland) knows all this, and basically wants to terrify and humiliate Farrell into confessing his sins to the world.  The issue is complicated when the sniper shoots someone and Farrell is quickly surrounded by cops, who think he did it.The movie, told in real time, builds in suspense very carefully, and it tight and mostly believable throughout.  Farrell, who really has to be convincing if this film is going to work, does a great job. This may be the film that finally makes him the full-blown star he's been predicted to be ever since TIGERLAND.  He's in the entire movie, every scene.  Forest Whitaker, always an interesting casting choice, plays the policeman involved in trying to talk Farrell out of the phone booth.  Everyone else in the film has a small part, and are mostly forgettable, although it was nice to see Mitchell again after her good work in PITCH BLACK.The film is very tense throughout, and I was really going with it literally up to the last five minutes.  The ending, however, is very rushed and feels anticlimactic.  Also, the ""evidence"" the sniper leaves behind, if you think about it for even 30 seconds, is IMPOSSIBLE given the timeline of the movie.  That's a fatal flaw that you don't even have to dig very deep to uncover.  And the very ending of the movie, the final ""sequence"" if you will, is pretty lame.The movie is only 81 minutes long, which is really too short for a full price movie.  So check it out at a bargain matinee, enjoy the terrific first 73 minutes or so, and do what you can to forgive the final few minutes.

Seldom are the thoughts provoked by the movie equal to the special effects or the actors delivery. This movie is the opposite. It has an extraordinary story line but doesn't do the ideas presented justice as it develops.The plot is about a psychopathic killer who listens to cell phone conversations looking for people in need of an opportunity for self-redemption....Something he kindly (*grin*) provides with the potential for a high velocity bullet to the victim's head, figuratively and literally. For what he does is to call the victim, in this case at a phone booth he was using to deceived his wife while trying to setup a liasion with a young tempting actress in-training.With scenes through the targetting scope the plot thickens with a killing of a pimp with the ladies of the night screaming that our victim in the phone booth did it, while he hangs on the phone talking all the while with his potential murderer. The idea is that decisions we make, the people we hurt, need redeeming, need justification for their pain. The shooter offers redemption through choices: the pimp, the cop, the wife, the potential quickie. Choices the victim is offered, along with his own [demise] at the hands of the cops---[demise] by barrage of police bullets.The movie suffers from potty mouth without reason or meaning, choices not explicit but left hanging (why didn't he [take out] the cop?), choice started and awkwardly dropped, (oughten one- wife or young girl have died?) But the threads are there, just dropped rather than explored, moving to something else rather than finishing what was started.Looks like the authors ought to get an A and the director a C. but it is an exciting movie, worth the time to see and even more so to investigate the threads the authors would have finished if he was allowed to actually make the movie rather than just write the script.....thanks for reading this. see you at the movies....richard williams",4,"plot is extraordinary, movie didn't do the ideas justice",1053302400,"05 19, 2003",2003,2006,"['Most', 'time', 'movies', 'suffer', 'poor', 'thinking', 'bad', 'plots', 'Seldom', 'are', 'thoughts', 'provoked', 'movie', 'equal', 'special', 'effects', 'actors', 'delivery', 'movie', 'opposite', 'extraordinary', 'story', 'line', ""n't"", 'do', 'ideas', 'presented', 'justice', 'plot', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'who', 'cell', 'phone', 'conversations', 'looking', 'people', 'need', 'opportunity', 'self-redemption', '.Something', 'kindly', '*grin*', 'potential', 'high', 'velocity', 'bullet', 'victim', 'head', 'figuratively', 'literally', 'what', 'call', 'victim', 'case', 'phone', 'booth', 'was', 'using', 'deceived', 'wife', 'trying', 'setup', 'liasion', 'young', 'tempting', 'actress', 'in-training.With', 'scenes', 'targetting', 'scope', 'plot', 'killing', 'pimp', 'ladies', 'night', 'screaming', 'victim', 'phone', 'booth', 'did', 'phone', 'talking', 'while', 'potential', 'murderer', 'idea', 'decisions', 'make', 'people', 'hurt', 'need', 'redeeming', 'need', 'justification', 'pain', 'shooter', 'redemption', 'choices', 'pimp', 'cop', 'wife', 'potential', 'quickie', 'victim', 'offered', 'own', '[', 'demise', ']', 'hands', 'cops', '[', 'demise', ']', 'barrage', 'police', 'bullets.The', 'movie', 'suffers', 'potty', 'mouth', 'reason', 'meaning', 'choices', 'not', 'explicit', 'left', 'hanging', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", '[', 'take', 'out', 'cop', 'choice', 'started', 'awkwardly', 'dropped', 'oughten', 'one-', 'wife', 'young', 'girl', 'have', 'died', 'threads', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'dropped', 'rather', 'explored', 'moving', 'something', 'else', 'rather', 'finishing', 'what', 'was', 'started.Looks', 'authors', 'ought', 'get', 'A', 'director', 'C.', 'exciting', 'movie', 'time', 'see', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'investigate', 'threads', 'authors', 'would', 'have', 'finished', 'was', 'allowed', 'actually', 'make', 'movie', 'rather', 'just', 'write', 'script', '..thanks', 'reading', 'see', 'movies', '.richard', 'williams']",N/A
603740,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JLQN,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[6, 9]","Phone Booth (Joel Schumacher, 2003)I got suckered again. I admit it. I watched yet another recent Joel Schumacher film. This time, I figured, Schumacher has himself a fantastic cast, it can't be any worse than Liberty Stands Still, and, really, it's less than eighty minutes long. How bad can it be?To answer that question, I will say that my first comment after the movie was over was ""the best thing about it was that it was less than eighty minutes long.""Colin Farrell (who is finally breaking out of the ""I'm a soldier"" stereotype) stars as Stu, a very not-nice guy who lies for a living. (He's a media publicist.) Stu makes a phone call from the same phone booth in New York City every day. On the last day before Verizon (nice product placement, there) is set to tear down the phone booth, while Stu is making his daily call, a guy tries to deliver him a pizza in the phone booth. Stu gets rid of the guy, then the phone starts to ring. He answers it and finds himself in conversation with another very not-nice guy (Kiefer Sutherland), who just happens to have a sniper rifle, and it's trained on the phone booth. If Stu hangs up, he dies. The sniper spends the rest of the film doing various things to put Stu into uncomfortable situations.Sound like the kind of thing a mean, well-armed teenager would do? Well, yeah. Wesley Snipes, in Liberty Stands Still, at least had himself a cause (even if it was a misguided one). This guy is just there for the fun of it, really, unless you believe his story about wanting to make Stu a better person by making him confess his sins in public. There's not really enough here to make it buyable. The sniper comes off like a sadistic juvenile. Stu comes off like someone who's perfectly content to be emotionally manipulated, and his gradual transformation into said Better Person is completely unbelievable. (This is not to take away from Farrell's acting job, which on its own might have pulled this off, had he not been handed such an awful script.)Schumacher, who decides about halfway through that you can't turn My Dinner with Andre into a suspense film, brings in the big guns. The police arrive on the scene, captained by Forest Whitaker, a man who needs no introduction, but has suddenly found himself in a number of roles that do no justice at all to his magnificent talent. Ghost Dog, phone home, we miss you. Stu's wife and would-be girlfriend are played by the wonderful Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, High Art) and the decent Katie Holmes (Go, The Gift) respectively, and their parts are painful to watch. Mitchell, one of the great underrated actresses of our time, is given sharkbait to work with, and to her credit treats the material with the respect it deserves, zilch. Holmes' part actually has some potential, early on. (Of course, his conversation with Holmes' character in the first few minutes is long enough to have some meat to it, whereas his conversation with Mitchell is obviously of the ""we need to introduce this character, how will we do it?"" variety.) Unfortunately, when Holmes turns up again halfway through the movie, her entire part consists of standing in a crowd with a pained look on her face.Given a cast like this, a proven situation, and even the barest competency in scriptwriting, camerawork, and direction, you've got a surefire winner. But the script was written by the inconsistent Larry Cohen, who turns out the odd script that fires (Best Seller, The Stuff) now and again, and the rest of the time turns out, well, the Maniac Cop movies and the third It's Alive movie, Island of the Alive. (If you haven't seen it, you've spared yourself a good deal of trauma.) Cinematographer Matthew Libatique provides hard evidence that good cinematography doesn't always outperform bad direction; the man who single-handedly made Tigerland barely watchable falters here with almost every step, which is extremely out of character (he's also Darren Aronofsky's preferred cinematographer. Nuff said.)  And then there is Joel Schumacher, who has completely forgotten how to make a good film since 1990. The guy who made Flatliners could have pulled this off without a second thought. But Joel Schumacher is no longer the guy who made Flatliners. He's the guy who made the last two Batman flops. * ",1,Scumacher screws up yet again.,1058486400,"07 18, 2003",2003,4277,"['Phone', 'Booth', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', '2003', 'got', 'suckered', 'again', 'admit', 'watched', 'yet', 'recent', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'film', 'time', 'figured', 'Schumacher', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'worse', 'Liberty', 'Stands', 'Still', 'really', 'less', 'eighty', 'minutes', 'long', 'How', 'bad', 'can', 'be', 'answer', 'question', 'will', 'say', 'first', 'comment', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'was', 'was', 'less', 'eighty', 'minutes', 'long', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'finally', 'breaking', ""'m"", 'soldier', 'stereotype', 'Stu', 'very', 'not-nice', 'guy', 'who', 'living', 'media', 'publicist', 'Stu', 'phone', 'call', 'same', 'phone', 'booth', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'day', 'last', 'day', 'Verizon', 'nice', 'product', 'placement', 'set', 'tear', 'down', 'phone', 'booth', 'Stu', 'making', 'daily', 'call', 'guy', 'deliver', 'pizza', 'phone', 'booth', 'Stu', 'rid', 'guy', 'then', 'phone', 'ring', 'conversation', 'very', 'not-nice', 'guy', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'trained', 'phone', 'booth', 'Stu', 'up', 'sniper', 'rest', 'film', 'doing', 'various', 'things', 'put', 'Stu', 'uncomfortable', 'situations.Sound', 'kind', 'thing', 'mean', 'well-armed', 'teenager', 'would', 'do', 'Well', 'yeah', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Liberty', 'Stands', 'Still', 'least', 'had', 'cause', 'even', 'was', 'misguided', 'one', 'guy', 'just', 'fun', 'really', 'believe', 'story', 'wanting', 'make', 'Stu', 'better', 'person', 'making', 'confess', 'sins', 'public', 'not', 'really', 'enough', 'here', 'make', 'buyable', 'sniper', 'sadistic', 'juvenile', 'Stu', 'someone', 'who', 'perfectly', 'content', 'be', 'emotionally', 'manipulated', 'gradual', 'transformation', 'said', 'Better', 'Person', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'Farrell', 'acting', 'job', 'own', 'might', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'handed', 'awful', 'script', 'Schumacher', 'who', 'halfway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'My', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'suspense', 'film', 'big', 'guns', 'police', 'arrive', 'scene', 'captained', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'man', 'who', 'introduction', 'suddenly', 'found', 'number', 'roles', 'do', 'justice', 'magnificent', 'talent', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'phone', 'home', 'miss', 'Stu', 'wife', 'would-be', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'High', 'Art', 'decent', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Go', 'Gift', 'respectively', 'parts', 'are', 'painful', 'watch', 'Mitchell', 'one', 'great', 'underrated', 'actresses', 'time', 'given', 'sharkbait', 'work', 'credit', 'material', 'respect', 'zilch', 'Holmes', 'part', 'actually', 'potential', 'early', 'course', 'conversation', 'Holmes', 'character', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'long', 'enough', 'have', 'meat', 'conversation', 'Mitchell', 'obviously', 'need', 'introduce', 'character', 'how', 'will', 'do', 'variety', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'Holmes', 'up', 'again', 'halfway', 'movie', 'entire', 'part', 'standing', 'crowd', 'pained', 'look', 'face.Given', 'cast', 'proven', 'situation', 'even', 'barest', 'competency', 'scriptwriting', 'camerawork', 'direction', ""'ve"", 'got', 'surefire', 'winner', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'inconsistent', 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'who', 'out', 'odd', 'script', 'Best', 'Seller', 'Stuff', 'now', 'again', 'rest', 'time', 'out', 'well', 'Maniac', 'Cop', 'movies', 'third', 'Alive', 'movie', 'Island', 'Alive', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'spared', 'good', 'deal', 'trauma', 'Cinematographer', 'Matthew', 'Libatique', 'hard', 'evidence', 'good', 'cinematography', ""n't"", 'always', 'outperform', 'bad', 'direction', 'man', 'who', 'single-handedly', 'made', 'Tigerland', 'barely', 'watchable', 'falters', 'here', 'almost', 'step', 'extremely', 'character', 'also', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'preferred', 'cinematographer', 'Nuff', 'said', 'then', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'who', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'how', 'make', 'good', 'film', '1990', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'Flatliners', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'second', 'thought', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'no', 'longer', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'Flatliners', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'last', 'two', 'Batman', 'flops', '*']",N/A

PHONE BOOTH stars two of Hollywood's biggest &quot;It&quot; actors, still-rising star Colin Farrell and comeback kid Kiefer Sutherland (thanks to the fantastic and heart-pounding TV action series &quot;24&quot;), in an exciting, suspenseful &quot;all-in-one-day&quot; film that borrows some inspiration from DOG DAY AFTERNOON (1975), directed by Sidney Lumet, and FALLING DOWN (1993), directed by Joel Schumacher. Well, reminders of the latter picture are no accident indeed, since Schumacher is the man at the helm of PHONE BOOTH.This movie is slick and almost impossibly fast from the get-go. It begins with a view of satellite communication systems orbiting far above Earth, then rapidly shoots all the way down to North America, to the northeastern United States, to New York City, to one single block in Manhattan (53rd Street &amp; Eight Avenue) on which stands the City's last remaining phone booth, which the helpful voice-over informs us will be removed the following morning to make way for a phone kiosk, the typical replacement for the notoriously dangerous phone booths. However, the final occupant of this phone booth is in for a big surprise...The final occupant being Stu Shepard, a young, greedy and dishonest publicist who believes his own b.s. probably because he spouts it out so fast that he hasn't the time to remember it once he's said it. He seems to be constantly yelling at people via his cell phone, but (as we find out within the first five minutes) uses this phone booth to make calls to a potential mistress Pam (Katie Holmes) so that his wife of one year, Kelly (Radha Mitchell) won't find out from the bill. With angry streetwalkers waiting to use the phone, Stu speaks briefly (and lasciviously) to Pam, when the phone rings again. Stu quickly answers it, and is met by a calm but threatening voice owned by a man who can see Stu from &quot;any one of a hundred windows&quot; around, and threatens to kill him if he hangs up. The hookers get super-angry and call on their pimp to get this yuppie phone-hogger off &quot;their&quot; phone. Stu tries to explain that he can't get off, the pimp takes a bat to the phone booth, Stu needs help...and quickly gets it from his tormentor, who shoots the pimp with a well-aimed hollow-point bullet that makes no sound but drops the big man like a sack of bricks. Everyone standing around thinks Stu shot the man, but they're wrong...and Stu can't get anyone to believe him. In the meantime, he is made to call his mistress and then his wife to spill the truth to each of them. Then Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) shows up on the scene, and wants answers, answers which Stu desparately tries to give him. Then the media arrives, all the while Stu is still kept on the phone...it's a tense situation that doesn't let up for a moment!Irishman Colin Farrell does a good job with his heavy Bronx accent, with his dark tones and pronounced inflections he almost seems Puerto Rican! Australian actress Radha Mitchell, who had already put on a successful American accent in the even more pulse-pounding PITCH BLACK (2000), obviously has no trouble here. However, Texas-born Forest Whitaker, a great African-American actor that I've admired for a long time, ends up overdoing his own New Yawk accent, so much so that I wondered if he'd prepared for this role by studying James Gandolfini in &quot;The Sopranos!&quot; Oh well, I still like him very much, and will note that he put on a great British accent in THE CRYING GAME (1992), which is another movie I need to review soon, come to think of it!PHONE BOOTH is directed in a frenetic, kinetic style, which lots of multiscreen shots (kind of like Kiefer Sutherland's show &quot;24&quot;) and *lots* of quick-cutting. Obviously, there is some violence, but it isn't very graphic; the main reason why this film earns its &quot;R&quot; rating is the language! There may be some plot holes here &amp; there, but I didn't think about them for the most part while watching. I would watch this movie again, so for buying purposes, I'd have to say that this film isRECOMMENDED; AGES 15 &amp; UP",4,"Slick Direction, Memorable Dialogue, Suspense Aplenty",1087689600,"06 20, 2004",2004,4546,"['review', 'title', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'kind', 'hard', 'devote', 'too', 'many', 'words', 'film', 'only', '81-minute', 'investment', 'time', 'audience', 'what', 'PHONE', 'BOOTH', '2003', 'well', ""'ll"", 'try', 'First', 'Jeff', 'Shannon', 'up', 'Obviously', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'bring', 'Oscars', 'Fox', '2000', 'Pictures', 'was', 'created', 'exciting', 'way', 'pass', 'one', 'time', 'level', 'very', 'nicely', 'PHONE', 'BOOTH', 'two', 'Hollywood', 'biggest', 'quot', 'quot', 'actors', 'still-rising', 'star', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'comeback', 'kid', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'thanks', 'fantastic', 'heart-pounding', 'TV', 'action', 'series', 'quot', '24', 'quot', 'exciting', 'suspenseful', 'quot', 'all-in-one-day', 'quot', 'film', 'inspiration', 'DOG', 'DAY', 'AFTERNOON', '1975', 'directed', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'FALLING', 'DOWN', '1993', 'directed', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Well', 'reminders', 'latter', 'picture', 'are', 'accident', 'indeed', 'Schumacher', 'man', 'helm', 'PHONE', 'BOOTH.This', 'movie', 'slick', 'almost', 'impossibly', 'fast', 'get-go', 'view', 'satellite', 'communication', 'systems', 'orbiting', 'far', 'Earth', 'then', 'rapidly', 'shoots', 'way', 'North', 'America', 'northeastern', 'United', 'States', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'one', 'single', 'block', 'Manhattan', '53rd', 'Street', 'amp', 'Eight', 'Avenue', 'City', 'last', 'remaining', 'phone', 'booth', 'helpful', 'voice-over', 'informs', 'will', 'be', 'removed', 'following', 'morning', 'make', 'way', 'phone', 'kiosk', 'typical', 'replacement', 'notoriously', 'dangerous', 'phone', 'booths', 'However', 'final', 'occupant', 'phone', 'big', 'surprise', 'final', 'occupant', 'being', 'Stu', 'Shepard', 'young', 'greedy', 'dishonest', 'publicist', 'who', 'own', 'b.s', 'probably', 'out', 'so', 'fast', ""n't"", 'time', 'remember', 'once', 'said', 'be', 'constantly', 'yelling', 'people', 'cell', 'phone', 'find', 'out', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'phone', 'make', 'calls', 'potential', 'mistress', 'Pam', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'wife', 'one', 'year', 'Kelly', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'bill', 'angry', 'streetwalkers', 'waiting', 'use', 'phone', 'Stu', 'briefly', 'lasciviously', 'Pam', 'when', 'phone', 'rings', 'again', 'Stu', 'quickly', 'met', 'calm', 'threatening', 'voice', 'owned', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'Stu', 'quot', 'one', 'hundred', 'windows', 'quot', 'kill', 'up', 'hookers', 'get', 'super-angry', 'call', 'pimp', 'get', 'yuppie', 'phone-hogger', 'quot', 'quot', 'phone', 'Stu', 'explain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'pimp', 'bat', 'phone', 'booth', 'Stu', 'help', 'quickly', 'tormentor', 'who', 'shoots', 'pimp', 'well-aimed', 'hollow-point', 'bullet', 'sound', 'big', 'man', 'sack', 'bricks', 'Everyone', 'standing', 'thinks', 'Stu', 'shot', 'man', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'Stu', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'anyone', 'believe', 'meantime', 'made', 'call', 'mistress', 'then', 'wife', 'spill', 'truth', 'Then', 'Captain', 'Ramey', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'up', 'scene', 'answers', 'answers', 'Stu', 'desparately', 'give', 'Then', 'media', 'arrives', 'while', 'Stu', 'still', 'kept', 'phone', 'tense', 'situation', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'moment', 'Irishman', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'good', 'job', 'heavy', 'Bronx', 'accent', 'dark', 'tones', 'pronounced', 'inflections', 'almost', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'put', 'successful', 'American', 'accent', 'even', 'more', 'pulse-pounding', 'PITCH', 'BLACK', '2000', 'obviously', 'trouble', 'here', 'However', 'Texas-born', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'great', 'African-American', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'admired', 'long', 'time', 'up', 'overdoing', 'own', 'New', 'Yawk', 'accent', 'so', 'much', 'wondered', ""'d"", 'prepared', 'role', 'studying', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'quot', 'Sopranos', 'quot', 'Oh', 'well', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'will', 'note', 'put', 'great', 'British', 'accent', 'THE', 'CRYING', 'GAME', '1992', 'movie', 'need', 'review', 'soon', 'come', 'think', 'PHONE', 'BOOTH', 'directed', 'frenetic', 'kinetic', 'style', 'lots', 'multiscreen', 'shots', 'kind', 'like', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'show', 'quot', '24', 'quot', '*lots*', 'quick-cutting', 'Obviously', 'violence', ""n't"", 'very', 'graphic', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'rating', 'language', 'may', 'be', 'plot', 'holes', 'here', 'amp', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'part', 'watching', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'buying', 'purposes', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'film', 'isRECOMMENDED', 'AGES', '15', 'amp', 'UP']",N/A

603752,A3RIFOMEH62KMV,B00005JLQN,"Scott C. Nelson ""scotty :-)""","[0, 0]","The initial draw I had for this movie were its two leads: Colin Farrell (well, let's just say I like him, A LOT :-)) and Keifer Sutherland (I'm a big fan of 24).  I did not even hear about this movie until I saw the trailer.  Once I heard Keifer's voice, I knew I HAD TO SEE IT!Once I read the reviews (and the subsequent information about it's original release date), my curiousity was doubly piqued.  And I was not dissappointed. YES, there are a TON of plot loopholes and ""what the heck""'s when you watch the movie, but if you take it for what it is, as it is, you're pretty much in for a good ride.  Not only is it a critique of modern life (doing what you can to get to the top, keeping ALL options open, putting yourself before others), in the wake of CURRENT EVENTS, it is a critique on THOSE current events.  Basically, 'Do things my way and you won't regret it, Oh wait, I've changed my mind, Do things my way and you will still have regrets"".  There are also slight overtones of Orwell's 1984 (Big Brother via Keifer's character).  One of the most starling aspects of the film, other than the majority of it taking place in and around one phone booth on a seedy street corner in NYC, is the way the director has placed Keifer's voice.  Even though you only get to see him for a few seconds in the whole film, his presence is NEVER in question.  He is there, and the way Joel Schumacher dubbed in his voice, chills will go down your spine.For those looking for a fluid, 'hole-less' film, skip this one.  While I loved the film, there are a lot of holes that no one can pretend aren't there.  If you are looking for a THRILLER, you better go see this one.

I think Phonebooth qualifies.  It's a Hollywood film that plays out like an independent film.  No, it's not gonna become a classic, nor will it win any awards, but it's quite entertaining in a 70s/80s B movie way.  It's kept pretty clever and original by being simple.  In fact, I'm sure most of the budget went to the actors' salaries.  What made me give this film a look wasn't the director, Schumacher(a man you can never trust coz of his frequent hits and misses), but the writer, Larry Cohen.  I've always been a big Larry Cohen fan, and it's interesting to see him involved with a production like this.  He directed the horror classics, God Told Me To(brainwashing alien Jesus impersonator), It's Alive(killer mutant baby), and The Stuff(remember?  about the addictive killer dessert that turns people into zombie-like lunatics?), and 70s blaxploitation flicks like Black Caesar.  No wonder Phonebooth has a nostalgic feel to it.  Check it out if you haven't already.

When the movie opens, we learn that he is married, and is planning on meeting up with one of his clients, a naive, small town girl played by Katie Holmes, who really believes that he cares for her. We learn this in between phone calls meant to convey that this character, Stu Shepard, is basically a jerk.Stu's trouble begins when he has to use a public telephone in order to contact the would-be mistress, Pamela (Holmes). The Caller (Keifer Sutherland), a sniper located in a window not too high above him, begins his little reign of terror. He calls Stu, and unable to resist the sound of a ringing telephone, the idiot picks it up.All the action takes place around this phone booth for the rest of the movie, which would have been okay if fifteen minutes into the movie, I didn't hate Stu so much that I wanted to just see him crack already. The Caller knows what a jerk he is, and he is out to make him confess his dirty secrets, you see.It was sort of a waste of film for me because I concluded from the first scene or so that Stu would be doing everyone a favor if he just hung up and took the bullet. He doesn't deserve his devoted wife, nor does he deserve his potential mistress. He is a complete jackass and because he is such a repulsive character, the movie is fatally flawed.In saying that, I hope the reader understands that this is not coming from a militant man-hater. It's just that Stu hasn't a single redeeming quality.  He is a pathetic creature and even as the movie progresses and we are meant to see a change in his character as the enormity of the pain he causes is realized, I got the feeling that if he survived all of this, he would be using the story to pick up chicks six months later.I say this also with the understanding that the character of Stu isn't supposed to be a nice guy. He's just so not nice that you don't even want to root for him to change. He is the star of the movie, the hero, so to speak, and while I realize that this wouldn't work with a character that was generally a nice guy, even a collosal jerk like Stu has to have something in his demeanor that makes the audience sit at the edge of their seats hoping he makes it out of there alive, or the movie simply feels like the longest 80 minutes of your life.I won't spoil it, but the ending was a bit of a rip-off. It was cheesy, when up until that point, cheesy would not have entered my vocabulary in the description of this film.The idea was great, but the execution of it was flawed by one vital point, that's all. Farrell did such a good job at being a jerk that he ruined the movie.

603761,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B00005JLQN,Takis Tz.,"[2, 2]","Well, it's one of those rare times where I'm finding myself siding against the naysayers, who in my opinion failed to not only get the point but to also enjoy this great film.I'll start with the objections this film stimulated and i'll take it on from there.A lot of reviewers are asking why the sniper in the film is doing what he does to the man in the phone booth. But, that's a moot question folks, and it only proves that you're conditioned to believe that everything has a ""logical"" reason behind it. Newsflash: it doesnt. Remember the recent sniper incidents in Washington? What was the ""logical"" reason behind them? Or, what was the ""logical"" motive of those killers? Why do you accept irrationality in real life but yet you look for ""reason"" when this ""irrationality"" is shown to you in a film? You see the contradiction here?""Phone booth"" is about a sniper who's picked out his next victim (he's already killed 2) after he's found out a few things about his life (mainly that he's a professional liar -media publicist - and that he's cheating on his wife). With this ""ace"" up his sleeve the sniper traps his victim in a phone booth by demonstrating to him that he, the sniper, is an expert shooter, and that he's enough over the edge to make due on his threats if the victim doesnt comply with the sniper's demands. Also, if not more importantly, the sniper threatens to reveal all the ill-doings of the victim to those that have been enduring his lies. With the threat of his marriage falling apart and with his whole career also threatened with destruction the victim is forced to play along in a game of life and death but cat and mouse as well..All this is layed-out in very convincing fashion by the scriptwriter and the director and it puzzles me that a few reviewers talk about plot-holes. Plot-holes? If someone can demonstrate to you that he's psychotic enough to gun you down for his own (whatever they might be) reasons and that he's good enough a shooter to manage it you would take your chances? You wouldnt be looking for such plotholes in real life, would you? Didnt think so.This film is brillant on many plateaus if i may say so..First of all, the risky business of having the entire movie filmed from the perspective of a phone booth could've been a disaster in other hands but the whole film-team has done a great job preventing that from being the case.The plot moves quickly with constantly reinventing itself, as the threats take new twists and as the sniper keeps using his intimate knowledge of the secrets of his victim to corner him even more. The arrival of the police at the scene after the sniper kills someone who attempts to ""boothjack"" the phone booth adds a new dimension to the victim's helplessness as they think that he is the killer, and thus, the victim realises that he's now got 2 fronts to deal with.No need to go into the plot deeper. It will keep you watching unless you refuse (this time for YOUR own bizzare reasons to see that you'd be reacting in a very similar way in the victim's shoes in the film).What's actually even more effective about the film is the cast. That, in its turn, is surprising as Farrel (the trapped booth guy) pulls out a great performance in portraying the scummy type who earns a living by daily spreading lies and financing his superficial but expensive lifestyle from them.But the show is actually stolen by the ""voice"" (Kiefer Sutherland). The voice has a tone that sounds, at the very least, super convincing about the threat it delivers. Firm, dark, sarcastic when needed and constantly ominous with a confidence that..kills, Kiefer is perfect being on the other end of the line. The ""voice"" is best when it talks about what drives it: and what drives it remains obscure till the end which i thought was the right way to go. At times the voice becomes the moral angel of death but before you can believe that it turns again into being a chaotic force that does what it does, well, because it..can!At a short, but steady and fast paced 80 minutes the ""Phone booth"" is actually amongst the top 3 thrillers of last year and one of the most intelligent recent films alltogether. Every element in it works and if there's one thing that seems to be taking the easy way out is the ending which i wont reveal here for obvious reasons. But even that is nothing that can subdue the power this film has.Great, great stuff.",5,A memorable call: chaos always wins...,1072310400,"12 25, 2003",2003,4397,"['Well', 'one', 'rare', 'times', 'where', ""'m"", 'finding', 'siding', 'naysayers', 'who', 'opinion', 'failed', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'point', 'also', 'enjoy', 'great', 'film.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'objections', 'film', 'stimulated', 'i', ""'ll"", 'take', 'there.A', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'are', 'asking', 'why', 'sniper', 'film', 'doing', 'what', 'man', 'phone', 'booth', 'moot', 'question', 'folks', 'only', ""'re"", 'conditioned', 'believe', 'everything', 'logical', 'reason', 'Newsflash', 'Remember', 'recent', 'sniper', 'incidents', 'Washington', 'What', 'was', 'logical', 'reason', 'what', 'was', 'logical', 'motive', 'killers', 'Why', 'do', 'accept', 'irrationality', 'real', 'life', 'yet', 'look', 'reason', 'when', 'irrationality', 'shown', 'film', 'see', 'contradiction', 'here', 'Phone', 'booth', 'sniper', 'who', 'picked', 'next', 'victim', 'already', 'killed', '2', 'found', 'out', 'few', 'things', 'life', 'mainly', 'professional', 'liar', '-media', 'publicist', 'cheating', 'wife', 'ace', 'up', 'sleeve', 'sniper', 'victim', 'phone', 'booth', 'demonstrating', 'sniper', 'expert', 'shooter', 'enough', 'edge', 'make', 'due', 'threats', 'victim', 'doesnt', 'comply', 'sniper', 'demands', 'Also', 'not', 'more', 'importantly', 'sniper', 'reveal', 'ill-doings', 'victim', 'have', 'been', 'enduring', 'lies', 'threat', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart', 'whole', 'career', 'also', 'threatened', 'destruction', 'victim', 'forced', 'play', 'along', 'game', 'life', 'death', 'cat', 'mouse', 'well..All', 'layed-out', 'very', 'convincing', 'fashion', 'scriptwriter', 'director', 'few', 'reviewers', 'talk', 'plot-holes', 'Plot-holes', 'someone', 'can', 'demonstrate', 'psychotic', 'enough', 'gun', 'down', 'own', 'might', 'be', 'reasons', 'good', 'enough', 'shooter', 'manage', 'would', 'take', 'chances', 'wouldnt', 'be', 'looking', 'such', 'plotholes', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'Didnt', 'think', 'so.This', 'film', 'brillant', 'many', 'plateaus', 'i', 'may', 'say', 'so..First', 'risky', 'business', 'having', 'entire', 'movie', 'filmed', 'perspective', 'phone', 'booth', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'disaster', 'other', 'hands', 'whole', 'film-team', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'preventing', 'being', 'case.The', 'plot', 'moves', 'quickly', 'constantly', 'reinventing', 'threats', 'take', 'new', 'twists', 'sniper', 'keeps', 'using', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'secrets', 'victim', 'corner', 'even', 'more', 'arrival', 'police', 'scene', 'sniper', 'someone', 'who', 'boothjack', 'phone', 'booth', 'new', 'dimension', 'victim', 'helplessness', 'think', 'killer', 'thus', 'victim', 'now', '2', 'fronts', 'deal', 'with.No', 'need', 'go', 'plot', 'deeper', 'will', 'keep', 'watching', 'refuse', 'time', 'YOUR', 'own', 'bizzare', 'reasons', 'see', ""'d"", 'be', 'reacting', 'very', 'similar', 'way', 'victim', 'shoes', 'film', '.What', 'actually', 'even', 'more', 'effective', 'film', 'cast', 'turn', 'surprising', 'Farrel', 'trapped', 'guy', 'out', 'great', 'performance', 'portraying', 'scummy', 'type', 'who', 'living', 'daily', 'spreading', 'lies', 'financing', 'superficial', 'expensive', 'lifestyle', 'show', 'actually', 'stolen', 'voice', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'voice', 'tone', 'very', 'least', 'super', 'convincing', 'threat', 'Firm', 'dark', 'sarcastic', 'when', 'needed', 'constantly', 'ominous', 'confidence', 'that..kills', 'Kiefer', 'perfect', 'being', 'other', 'end', 'line', 'voice', 'best', 'when', 'what', 'what', 'obscure', 'end', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'right', 'way', 'go', 'times', 'voice', 'moral', 'angel', 'death', 'can', 'believe', 'again', 'being', 'chaotic', 'force', 'what', 'well', 'it..can', 'short', 'steady', 'fast', 'paced', '80', 'minutes', 'Phone', 'booth', 'actually', 'amongst', 'top', '3', 'thrillers', 'last', 'year', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'recent', 'films', 'alltogether', 'element', 'one', 'thing', 'be', 'taking', 'easy', 'way', 'ending', 'i', 'wont', 'reveal', 'here', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'even', 'nothing', 'can', 'subdue', 'power', 'film', 'has.Great', 'great', 'stuff']",N/A

Dramatic and stunning performances make, what many people called a weak script, an almost believable story (remember, it's Hollywood, not a documentary we're watching here).  Colin Farrell maintains a consistent level of paranoia, fear, and even denial throughout the entire ordeal.  I am very disappointed in the trailer for the film, which practically shows you the entire movie with little room left for curiosity.  I went in only knowing a guy is trapped in a booth because of a sniper, and that was it.  Perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so much.  At any rate, if you like dramatic performances and an interesting concept, Phone Booth is definitely worth a viewing.

Little did I realize that I had already seen this movie, but it was called Liberty Stands Still. This movie could have been so much better. Suspense? No. Good story? No. Good actors, not really. The guy in the phone booth is a complete a-hole, so why would you care if he gets killed anyways? Probably doing the world a favor. Kieffer Sutherland's voice was perfect for the guy on the other end of the phone. I can't really say anything else about what works without giving away the whole movie (like that would be a bad thing). I know I'm just rambling here. Bottom line, I'm glad I rented this because I would have been very upset had I paid full movie price at a theater. My girlfriend had trouble staying awake during the movie. I found it fairly interesting, but mostly because I was waiting to see what would happen next that had already been done in Liberty Stands Still. There are lots of similarities. Rent this one. Don't buy it. Because I really doubt you'll have any desire to ever watch it again.

He wasted so much time just to get him to confess to his wife and girlfriend of his sins. Unfortunately, Stu was a sissy child who cried way too much and proved to me that he really wasn't a playa!

603766,A22QPZWME85Z8T,B00005JLQN,"Timothy Hammond ""Movie Geek""","[2, 2]","&quot;Phone Booth&quot; surprised me slightly in the fact that it was an entertaining movie and managed to only teter on the brink of cheesiness and melodrama rather than plummeting entirely into that chasm.  On the other hand, it did not surprise me that this movie turned out to be one that I enjoyed watching at the time, but will most likely completely forget about relatively soon.  This is the type of movie that you pop in the DVD player, or better yet, find on cable on a rainy Saturday afternoon.While the movie itself is slightly above average, Colin Farrell's performance is admittedly pretty good and goes a long way towards helping the overall merit of &quot;Phone Booth&quot;.  Farrell is asked to basically carry the movie by himself (aided somewhat by the sometimes creepy, sometimes unintentionally funny disembodied voice of Kiefer Sutherland).  What is perhaps most difficult about his role is the fact that he plays a sleazy guy who must elicit a sympathic response from the audience in order for the movie to work, a feat which Farrell pulls off admirably.The plot, as anyone can tell from the preview, is thin, and one can almost hear it stretched to the point of breaking by the time the movie ends.  The issue explored in &quot;Phone Booth&quot;, that of a vigilante who seeks to punish despicable human beings, is well meaning and idealistic, but too heavy handed, and was explored much more powerfully in Se7en.All in all, &quot;Phone Booth&quot; is a decent movie, but perhaps would have been more effective as an hour long TV show or two part mini-series.",3,Pulpy Saturday afternoon matinee,1060819200,"08 14, 2003",2003,1583,"['quot', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'quot', 'surprised', 'slightly', 'fact', 'was', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'managed', 'only', 'teter', 'brink', 'cheesiness', 'melodrama', 'rather', 'plummeting', 'entirely', 'chasm', 'other', 'hand', 'did', 'not', 'surprise', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'time', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'completely', 'forget', 'relatively', 'soon', 'type', 'movie', 'pop', 'DVD', 'player', 'better', 'yet', 'find', 'cable', 'rainy', 'Saturday', 'movie', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'performance', 'admittedly', 'pretty', 'good', 'long', 'way', 'helping', 'overall', 'merit', 'quot', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'quot', 'Farrell', 'asked', 'basically', 'carry', 'movie', 'aided', 'somewhat', 'sometimes', 'creepy', 'sometimes', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'disembodied', 'voice', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'What', 'perhaps', 'most', 'difficult', 'role', 'fact', 'sleazy', 'guy', 'who', 'must', 'elicit', 'sympathic', 'response', 'audience', 'order', 'movie', 'work', 'feat', 'Farrell', 'admirably.The', 'plot', 'anyone', 'can', 'tell', 'preview', 'thin', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'stretched', 'point', 'breaking', 'time', 'movie', 'issue', 'explored', 'quot', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'quot', 'vigilante', 'who', 'punish', 'despicable', 'human', 'beings', 'well', 'meaning', 'idealistic', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed', 'was', 'explored', 'much', 'more', 'powerfully', 'Se7en.All', 'quot', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'quot', 'decent', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'hour', 'long', 'TV', 'show', 'two', 'part', 'mini-series']",N/A
603767,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00005JLQN,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Who would have thought a movie about a guy in a phone booth would be as interesting as it was? I suppose when Joel Shumacher is directing an all-star cast, anything, even an entire movie that takes place in a phone booth, can be interesting! Colin Farrell stars as a man who lies, cheats, and does anything it takes to get to the top of his profession. He thinks he's on top of the world, with a wife, a girlfriend, and a group of clients, who don't know what scum he is, but someone has noticed the real Stu Shepard and has trained a rifle on him. Shepard has to do as he is told or risk becoming yet another victim, of a man who has been targeting New York City's businessmen. Colin Farrell is a very versatile actor, it's always been his biggest strength, but generally I find his performances to be kind of flat. Farrell has never been someone who I would consider a top tier Hollywood actor, but looking back on this early performance, I have to tell you, I was impressed. The setting of the film was so limited, that the only way it works is if you have a strong and believable cast, which Phone Booth certainly has. Every character has a unique back story and everyone is interconnected, in a film that is full of intrigue and edge of your seat action. People may not know what a phone booth is anymore, but this film is far from outdated. It is an excellent edge of your seat thrill ride that is perfect for the person who wants a short, but exciting movie.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,1465,"['Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'movie', 'guy', 'phone', 'booth', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'interesting', 'was', 'suppose', 'when', 'Joel', 'Shumacher', 'directing', 'all-star', 'cast', 'anything', 'even', 'entire', 'movie', 'place', 'phone', 'booth', 'can', 'be', 'interesting', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'man', 'who', 'cheats', 'anything', 'get', 'top', 'profession', 'top', 'world', 'wife', 'girlfriend', 'group', 'clients', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'scum', 'someone', 'noticed', 'real', 'Stu', 'Shepard', 'trained', 'rifle', 'Shepard', 'do', 'told', 'risk', 'becoming', 'yet', 'victim', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'targeting', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'businessmen', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'very', 'versatile', 'actor', 'always', 'been', 'biggest', 'strength', 'generally', 'find', 'performances', 'be', 'kind', 'flat', 'Farrell', 'never', 'been', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'consider', 'top', 'tier', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'looking', 'back', 'early', 'performance', 'have', 'tell', 'was', 'impressed', 'setting', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'limited', 'only', 'way', 'have', 'strong', 'believable', 'cast', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'certainly', 'Every', 'character', 'unique', 'back', 'story', 'everyone', 'interconnected', 'film', 'full', 'intrigue', 'edge', 'seat', 'action', 'People', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'phone', 'booth', 'anymore', 'film', 'far', 'outdated', 'excellent', 'edge', 'seat', 'thrill', 'ride', 'perfect', 'person', 'who', 'short', 'exciting', 'movie']",N/A
603768,A96JD9312DHWC,B00005JLQN,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[8, 16]","Stu Shepard lives an extremely complex life while pretending to be somebody important. Feigning interest in people while attempting to use them, juggling a wife and a girlfriend while hoping to taste the best of both worlds, and portraying himself as something better than a publicist takes a lot of time and finagling. But stepping into that phone booth he's used time and again and answering an incoming call makes his situation all the more difficult to adjust to - and live through.While watching Phone Booth, I - like the man in the booth - went through mood swings of my own. First I thought it was going to be a nice ride, liking the introduction of Stu and the things added to him that seemed to scream ""sniper bait."" The ego, the flash, and all the pretty words seem to state that someone might want to take revenge on our main character. Colin Ferrel actually seemed to fit the role, too, delivering a nice punch as a jerk, and I kept thinking that he would make a nice ""victim"" in a game that was certainly going to try to turn the tables on him. Then came the phone booth and the call, leading into the little games and all the hoops he was told to jump through, and I found myself going from a mindset of ""that's not a good situaiton to be in"" to wondering where this was going. Granted, the torment was fun at first and the research the shooter did was commendable. Still, the conversation and the deconstruction seemed almost pointless as everything moved forward. There was a lot of shouting, some ""do what I say or else"" comments spoken, but the progression didn't seem to have any really meaning attached. And next came the torment that just kept going on and on and on, and I kept wondering when it would finally end and let me out of the booth as well. Some situations that should have been tense showcased themselves more than once as they hoped for dramatic build and I found myself fighting the urge to fast forward some of those supposed tense scenarios. And when it ended I thought that the reasoning behind it was cold-blooded and made up for the stringing along effect I sat through, but the movie itself went on a tad too long and was hard to forgive.This isn't to say that I found the movie without any substance and vacant, because there were some decent portions playing within the whole. The message within the bottle was a disturbing, sure, and the Sutherland as the bad guy gave him a bit of appeal. When it came down to presentation, however, the movie was nothing more than views from a scope, a phone booth, and some snapshots of a police roadblock. Development of the ""why"" involved wasn't really there, nor was the movie ever really focused on anyone save for the man in the booth. We only heard Sutherland's voice until the very end and didn't see anything to say who he was or why he did things, and Forest Whitaker served only as a way to try and bring conclusion and to play a clich&eacute; police role. So, would that mean I'm calling this a waste of time? No, I wouldn't go that far. I'd simply advise against seeing it unless you need something to watch, boredom and a lack of better movies to watch playing a key role therein, and can't keep your curiosity at bay.",3,Moral:Wear a Flak Jacket When Taking Stray Calls!,1072137600,"12 23, 2003",2003,3211,"['Stu', 'Shepard', 'extremely', 'complex', 'life', 'pretending', 'be', 'somebody', 'important', 'Feigning', 'interest', 'people', 'attempting', 'use', 'juggling', 'wife', 'girlfriend', 'hoping', 'taste', 'best', 'worlds', 'portraying', 'something', 'better', 'publicist', 'lot', 'time', 'finagling', 'stepping', 'phone', 'booth', 'used', 'time', 'again', 'answering', 'incoming', 'call', 'situation', 'more', 'difficult', 'adjust', 'live', 'through.While', 'watching', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'man', 'booth', 'went', 'mood', 'swings', 'own', 'First', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'nice', 'ride', 'liking', 'introduction', 'Stu', 'things', 'added', 'seemed', 'scream', 'sniper', 'bait', 'ego', 'flash', 'pretty', 'words', 'seem', 'state', 'someone', 'might', 'want', 'take', 'revenge', 'main', 'character', 'Colin', 'Ferrel', 'actually', 'seemed', 'fit', 'role', 'too', 'delivering', 'nice', 'punch', 'jerk', 'kept', 'thinking', 'would', 'make', 'nice', 'victim', 'game', 'was', 'certainly', 'going', 'try', 'turn', 'tables', 'Then', 'came', 'phone', 'booth', 'call', 'leading', 'little', 'games', 'hoops', 'was', 'told', 'jump', 'found', 'going', 'mindset', 'not', 'good', 'situaiton', 'be', 'wondering', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'Granted', 'torment', 'was', 'fun', 'first', 'research', 'shooter', 'did', 'was', 'commendable', 'Still', 'conversation', 'deconstruction', 'seemed', 'almost', 'pointless', 'everything', 'moved', 'forward', 'was', 'lot', 'shouting', 'do', 'what', 'say', 'else', 'comments', 'spoken', 'progression', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'really', 'meaning', 'attached', 'next', 'came', 'torment', 'just', 'kept', 'going', 'kept', 'wondering', 'when', 'would', 'finally', 'end', 'let', 'booth', 'as', 'well', 'situations', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'tense', 'showcased', 'more', 'once', 'hoped', 'dramatic', 'build', 'found', 'fighting', 'urge', 'fast', 'forward', 'supposed', 'tense', 'scenarios', 'when', 'ended', 'thought', 'reasoning', 'was', 'cold-blooded', 'made', 'up', 'stringing', 'effect', 'sat', 'movie', 'went', 'tad', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'hard', 'forgive.This', ""n't"", 'say', 'found', 'movie', 'substance', 'vacant', 'were', 'decent', 'portions', 'playing', 'whole', 'message', 'bottle', 'was', 'disturbing', 'sure', 'Sutherland', 'bad', 'guy', 'gave', 'bit', 'appeal', 'When', 'came', 'down', 'presentation', 'however', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'views', 'scope', 'phone', 'booth', 'snapshots', 'police', 'roadblock', 'Development', 'why', 'involved', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'there', 'was', 'movie', 'ever', 'really', 'focused', 'anyone', 'save', 'man', 'booth', 'only', 'heard', 'Sutherland', 'voice', 'very', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'say', 'who', 'was', 'why', 'did', 'things', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'served', 'only', 'way', 'try', 'bring', 'conclusion', 'play', 'clich', 'eacute', 'police', 'role', 'So', 'would', 'mean', ""'m"", 'calling', 'waste', 'time', 'No', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', ""'d"", 'simply', 'advise', 'seeing', 'need', 'something', 'watch', 'boredom', 'lack', 'better', 'movies', 'watch', 'playing', 'key', 'role', 'therein', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'curiosity', 'bay']",N/A

This time they are given a script from prolific (and perhaps underrated) B movie-king Larry Cohen.Colin Farrell is Stu, New Work publicist who thinks the world goes around just for him.  Then he gets an anomymous call at a phone booth; now he gets it, and the guy on the other side of the phone says: &quot;If you hang up the phone, you are dead.&quot;And this strange guy with malicious voice really means it, pointing a rifle at Stu's head from somewhere in the high building in New York City (actually, the film was shot mostly in LA).  His wife and would-be mistress arrive at the scene, only to complicate the situation, but the criminal seems enjoying it, and continues to order Stu to do things he never dreamed of.The film is short, which means a good thing.  You cannot keep on forever, holding the attention of the audience in this way, and in fact, the little moralistic conclusion is diappointment.  Thankfully, Colin Farrell (no matter what some people say) is a talented actor, and gives a credible performance as a guy trapped in this incredibly thankless situation.The supports are Forest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell (&quot;High Art&quot;&quot;Pitch Black&quot;) and Katie Holmes, but their roles are smaller ones compared to his.  Of more interest is the sniper's role, whose voice must have convincing sound.  &quot;24&quot;'s Kiefer Sutherland is cast in that part, and it works in a terrific way.Remember, &quot;Phone Booth&quot; is basically a B-movie.

603771,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00005JLQN,Tucker Andersen,"[1, 1]","This is a psychological thriller which takes place in the Times Square neighborhood of NYC. The central character (he is no way a hero) spends almost the entire length of the movie (only one hour and twenty minutes) in a phone booth. Stu Shepard (Colin Farrrell) is the epitome of a loudmouthed publicist and con artist who is currently attempting to pursue a relationship with Katie Holmes (Pamela McFadden) despite being in love with his beautiful wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell). The movie begins slowly as we watch Stu engage in several cellphone conversations which seem more attuned to promoting himself than his clients. Stu then stops at the infamous PHONE BOOTH to call Katie (who does not know that he is married) to set up a date supposedly to discuss promoting her career.As Stu is about to leave the booth, the phone rings and a mysterious caller threatens to kill Stu with a high powered rifle if Stu hangs up and leaves the booth. The caller seems omniscient, and wants Stu to confess his imagined infidelties to both Kelly and Katie. To prove his intent, the caller (the creepy voice of Kiefer Sutherland) kills a pimp (John Enos) who is harrassing Stu because he will not free the phone so that it will be available for his girls to talk to their clents. Of course, the murder immediately attracts a police presence, and Stu logically is assumed to be the killer.Forest Whitaker is well cast as Captain Ramey, the person in charge of the situation. His presence of mind and determination to discover the cause of the bizarre standoff actually create believabilty in the screenplay. Meanwhile, the mystery caller eventually manipulates Stu into confessing to his wife after attempting to protect her initially by denying to the police that he knew her. Of course, the situation seems hopeless for Stu, especially given the technique used by the killer to frame Stu for the murder. A good part of the tension is wanting to know who will remain alive (Stu, Kelly, Captain Ramey, the caller?) and how the standoff will be resolved. And the conclusion is satisfying in a Hollywood sense but not at all the typical happy ending for all concerned.I had decided to see this film despite the almost total implausibilty of the plot because I was intrigued to see if director Joel Schmuacher could really sustain the audience's interest given the constaints of the story. I found my intere sustained and was much more impressed than I expected to be. Of course it is unbelievable, but no more so than most movies. The fact that the actors are recognizable but not major stars contributed to its intensity, since you could relate to them in the roles which they played. It was also the right length; the story played out in a coherent way without seeming either drawn out or becoming unbearably tense. There was also sufficient humor to both break the tension and make the movie considerably less depressing than it would otherwise have been.This is certainly not a movie that everyone will enjoy. There is almost no action other than the dialog, minimal cinematic effects, only one location, and incredible and almost continuous profanity (although most is in character rather than gratuitous). Not surprisingly given the lack of sophisticated content, the few media reviews by professionals which I have seen have ranged from lukewarm to outright pans.

In PHONE BOOTH, Stu Shepard does and it changes his life forever. Stu is a semi-successful publicist who has been playing games with people his whole life.  Everyday he goes to the exact same phone booth to make a telephone call to his girlfriend so that his wife won't find out. He's not having an affair, just contemplaing having one.  One day the phone in the booth and there's nobody around to answer it.  Curiousity killed the cat. Stu's no cat, but he is awfully curious and picks it up.  On the other line is killer who has been sniping off lowlifes and scums from the face of the New York City. The sniper tells Stu that he'll shoot him if he doesn't do exactly what he tells him to do and thus begins a game of cat and mouse via the public telephone lines in the phone booth.PHONE BOOTH was a fairly entertaing thriller that's great to eat while eating some popcorn.  Colin Farrell is over-rated as an actor, but PHONE BOOTH is one of the few movies where he's been cast right. Kiefer Sutherland's vocal performance is quite remarkable and sets the tone for the entire movie. Forest Whitaker has a nice supporting role as the police captain in charge of bringing the ""dangerous criminal"" Stu in alive and without getting anyone else injured or killed. None of the other performances stand out, largely because the characters aren't given much screen time.The plot in PHONE BOOTH is full of holes and inconsistencies, yet it is somehow able to keep one's attention.  The biggest flaw that I found with the film is that the ending was much too tight and overly convenient.  With a run time of less than 85 minutes the filmmakers could have added a little something to fill in some empty spots and make a more satisfying ending.

I found few mediocre films by him but at the same time I found few of my favorites: The Lost Boys (1987), Flatliners (1990),  Falling Down (1993), The Client (1994). Based on this research I had no choice but to watch this film.Main character Stu (Colin Farrell at his best performance) is one of this fake New Yorkers: some publicist, dressed in a fake coat of bogus fame and unexciting BIG contacts. He stops by at the phone booth to make his regular call to another women, the one which doesn't know that he is married... As soon as he hangs up? A phone call... A phone call for him... A phone call by a sniper. He has to play by the sniper's rules, or someone will die.A thriller? An action? A psychological drama? I would say all of it at the same time... but much more. Did I want to know what will happen next? Yes! Did this film make me think? Yes!From my point of view, this film mostly about art of listening. We often prejudge situations and people. But we forget to listen, to understand and hear the meaning of simple clues which might save our own life. And Forest Whitaker as Captain Ramey did this part very well.On the other hand it gives us a slight idea how one second can change our life forever.

Unfortunately, Family Plot became Hitch's last film and shortly there after Hitch died. While it is pleasant and diverting, there's no telling what Hitch might have come up with as he worked with Cohen on this thriller. COuld it have been another North by Northwest or another Rope? It's difficult to say. Sadly, we'll never know what potential Hitch could have found in this script.The premise is promising; Colin Farrell plays an oily PR man who uses his cellphone as his weapon. He thrusts and parries as if it is a sword picking on a wide variety of both suspecting and unsuspecting villans. The predator is preying on creatures of a like mind.The one person he doesn't use his cellphone to call is the young actress he is trying to seduce. He's been using the same payphone everyday to speak to his potential conquest so his wife won't spot the unfamilar calls on his bill. An unseen sniper played to perfection by Keifer Sutherland has been following Farrell's character. On a day he knows Farrell will use the phonebooth, he stakes it out with a high powered rifle. He's become judge and jury for a man he finds morally wanting. His threat is simple; Farrell has to confess to his wife that he has been planning to cheat on her and the sniper will let him go. Farrell can't do it. Instead, he harrassed by hookers who use the phone regular; mistaken as a murderer by the police when someone is killed by the sniper and trapped in the phonebooth. If he tries to leave without completing what's been asked of him, the sniper will kill him.Director Joel Schumaker (Batman Forever, Tigerland, A Time to Kill)creates a suspenseful thriller using what is, essentially, a rewrite of Cohen's own God Told Me To. His use of split screen is similar to Brian DePalma's best work (particularly the underrated Blow Out and Carrie). This technique isn't particularly new revolutionary. I see someone has made reference to the television series 24 and its use of this technique. It's an approach that hasn't been used much in film over the last decade and the adoption of it for television gave an edgy quality to 24. It also works in Phonebooth as well. Schmaker keeps it interesting by giving multiple angles of the same event, breaking up the splitscreen almost as if it was a picture-in-picture mode on a television. It generates suspense even in the less credible scenes of the film.While Cohen's script is a tad bit predictable (particular as it winds down to its conclusion), the first 40 minutes are fresh and vibrant. Partially that's due to the director and the script but a lot of that energy is injected into the thriller by Farrell's corrosive PR guy. He inhabits the character brilliantly (I had to chuckle during the scene where he gives the police officer tickets to see Britney Spears and tells the officer to &quot;give her my love&quot; art imitating life or vice verse?).The performances by most of the male characters are very good to outstanding. Katie Holmes plays the potential love interest for Farrell and her role is a thankless one. She doesn't have all that much to do during the first half of the film than talk back to the villan on the phone.Screenwriter Richard Walter once told me that there's nothing more boring than a scene with a character on a telephone. To give Cohen, Schumaker and Farrell credit they almost get away with using this one-trick poney to create a credible suspense film. While Schumaker's a talented director, he's no Hitchcock or Spielberg. Hitchcock would have found something to make the story more interesting and come up with a character that we actually care for that we don't totally respect. Still, I have to give Schumaker high marks for tackling such a limited movie; the restrictions placed on him during much of the movie are somewhat similar to those that Hitch placed on himself with Rope (although to be fair, much of what we see in Phonebooth takes place away from Farrell's character. We're able to &quot;see&quot; this because the characters are speaking to other characters on the phone).Phonebooth would have made an interesting and very good B movie. It's a bit underwhelming as an A movie. The extra money spent on projects like this can actually work against the project.The transfer to DVD is very good. The sound is outstanding. The extras are a bit on the slim side given all the extra room on this disc but quite interesting. Farrell's performance and Schumaker's direction make this a much more interesting project than it might have been in lesser hands. While the concept is stretched out too long and hasn't dated all that well (how likely is it that his wife would find single out the phone number of the girl Farrell's trying to seduce given all the people he calls multiple times during the day?), Cohen and Schumaker make a game attempt to update it. There was a comment in somebody else's review about how this would have made an interesting Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode. That's slighting the effort that went into this project. In the right hands and in another era, Phonebooth would have worked very well as a feature film. It's the wrong movie for the wrong era.",3,"Brisk, tight thriller provides a suspenseful  ride",1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,5201,"['Larry', 'Cohen', 'wrote', 'Hitchcock', 'mind', 'Unfortunately',

If you saw the trailer for it you were probably asking yourself how a whole movie could take place in just one spot (hence: ""where's the action?"").  Rest assured, there is not a dull moment.  You pretty much know the basis here: Colin Farrell gets held hostage inside a telephone cubicle by a sniper who boasts a creepily captivating voice.  And to be honest, that is pretty much it.  There is an ample story behind why Stu (Farrell) is held there, though that itself is probably the reason the movie becomes predictable towards the very end.  Predictability seems to be an irreversible (and almost tolerable) tactic for movies nowadays, but I do have to say an ending more along the lines of a movie like `Seven' might've been more stirring and exalting.  Am I alone?  Besides the culminating predictability, other down notes include: the running time--a mere 88 minutes--and on a more materialistic note, the DVD special features.  In essence, there are none.  All you get is some commentary and the infamous theatrical trailer.Do not let my take on the ending and my displeasure with the DVD extras convince you not to watch this movie.  This is an exciting flick that will certainly keep you on the edge of your seat from the pick-up to the hang-up.  Forest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell, and even Katie Holmes give supporting performances worthy of mention.  But in the end, it's the guy who picks up the phone, Colin Farrell, that makes this movie so neat and exhilarating.  `Phone Booth' is a good unique movie.

""A ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?"" The Caller (an unseen Kiefer Sutherland) demands that Stu, do everything he asks, or people will start to die. Once he proves to Stu that he has a rifle aimed right at him, the fun begins. The Caller has decided to help Stu redeem himself and proceeds to torment him about his latest transgressions. Although Stu is unarmed, he's been fingered as having a gun and begins attracting a large crowd, including police Capt. Ramey (Forest Whitaker).While the supporting cast is good, Colin Farrell is definitely a one-man show in this short film of only 81-minutes. (Any longer and it probably would've lost its impact.) Farrell is convincing and easily believable in this role, which includes a gut-wrenching speech to his wife that makes the audience finally sympathize.Although Farrell plays the lead and succeeds in capturing the audience himself, I have to admit, the voice of Kiefer Sutherland as the Caller was the best unseen performance ever. Lately, I'm used to Sutherland as the hero on TV's ""24"", but I do recall many other roles where he was just pure evil. Here, he's a cold, horrifying psychopath. He's always so cool and calm, it's so eerie. He's just perfect.Good, suspenseful movie. Rated-R for strong language and some violence. I'm thinking ""sequel?""",4,One Man Show,1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,1638,"['Stu', 'Shepard', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'obnoxious', 'cocky', 'lying', 'scheming', 'Manhattan', 'PR', 'consultant', 'Not', 'nice', 'guy', 'day', 'same', 'enclosed', 'phone', 'booth', 'call', 'girlfriend', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'wife', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'number', 'cell', 'phone', 'bill.Today', 'phone', 'Stu', 'favorite', 'booth', 'rings', 'ringing', 'phone', 'be', 'answered', ""n't"", 'Caller', 'unseen', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Stu', 'do', 'everything', 'people', 'will', 'start', 'die', 'Once', 'Stu', 'rifle', 'aimed', 'right', 'fun', 'Caller', 'decided', 'help', 'Stu', 'redeem', 'proceeds', 'torment', 'latest', 'transgressions', 'Stu', 'unarmed', 'been', 'fingered', 'having', 'gun', 'attracting', 'large', 'crowd', 'including', 'police', 'Capt', 'Ramey', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'definitely', 'one-man', 'show', 'short', 'film', 'only', '81-minutes', 'Any', 'longer', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'impact', 'Farrell', 'convincing', 'easily', 'believable', 'role', 'gut-wrenching', 'speech', 'wife', 'audience', 'finally', 'sympathize.Although', 'Farrell', 'lead', 'capturing', 'audience', 'have', 'admit', 'voice', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Caller', 'was', 'best', 'unseen', 'performance', 'ever', 'Lately', ""'m"", 'used', 'Sutherland', 'hero', 'TV', '24', 'do', 'recall', 'many', 'other', 'roles', 'where', 'was', 'just', 'pure', 'evil', 'Here', 'cold', 'horrifying', 'psychopath', 'always', 'so', 'cool', 'calm', 'so', 'eerie', 'just', 'perfect.Good', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'Rated-R', 'strong', 'language', 'violence', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'sequel']",N/A
603778,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00005JLQN,Westley,"[0, 0]","PHONE BOOTH is the second pairing of director Joel Schumacher and star Collin Farrell; unfortunately it is a disappointment compared to their first collaboration, &quot;Tigerland.&quot;  Farrell playes a sleazy, small-time New York press agent.  He lies to his clients, the press, and anyone else he can use.  This situation comes to a head when he is pinned down in a phone booth by a sniper.Schmuacher can be a good action director, so I was expecting much more from this movie.  Even though the movie is short (my DVD counter said 89 minutes), it really drags at times.  Farrell is pretty good, but we don't get to know much about his character before the sniper incident, so I really didn't care much about what happened to him.  The characters also tend to be a bit over-the-top, expecially the three prostitutes, who add some unintentional (?) humor.  Also, PHONE BOOTH is ultimately too preachy and moralistic for it's own good; it's simply too shallow of a movie to pull it off well.Perhaps the best part is Schumacher's director's commentary; Schumacher is a solid director and he knows the kind of information that will be of interest to the audience.  Too bad he didn't have as much sense when he was making the movie.",2,Disappointing Thriller,1057881600,"07 11, 2003",2003,1229,"['PHONE', 'BOOTH', 'second', 'pairing', 'director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'star', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'unfortunately', 'disappointment', 'compared', 'first', 'collaboration', 'quot', 'Tigerland.', 'quot', 'Farrell', 'sleazy', 'small-time', 'New', 'York', 'press', 'agent', 'clients', 'press', 'anyone', 'else', 'can', 'use', 'situation', 'head', 'when', 'pinned', 'down', 'phone', 'booth', 'sniper.Schmuacher', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'action', 'director', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'Even', 'movie', 'short', 'DVD', 'counter', 'said', '89', 'minutes', 'really', 'times', 'Farrell', 'pretty', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'much', 'character', 'sniper', 'incident', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'also', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'expecially', 'three', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'add', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'Also', 'PHONE', 'BOOTH', 'ultimately', 'too', 'preachy', 'moralistic', 'own', 'good', 'simply', 'too', 'shallow', 'movie', 'pull', 'off', 'best', 'part', 'Schumacher', 'director', 'commentary', 'Schumacher', 'solid', 'director', 'kind', 'information', 'will', 'be', 'interest', 'audience', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'sense', 'when', 'was', 'making', 'movie']",N/A

Collin Farrell is held hostage in a phone booth in manhattan until he makes amends for his dishonesty.  By who, well, I guess it is the world's best observer with lots of time on his hands (kiefer sutherland).  It was amazing how the movie did a good job at covering the bases to make it so this the main character couldn't leave the booth. Often times in badly written movies within a few minutes you figure out how they people are going to escape. You do here as well, realizing it will have to be the police that figure out what is going on, but it was interesting and at least entertaining how they got their.
