Unfortunately. the visual quality of some of these ads can be extremely poor. Nonetheless, this set is a very fun trip into the past for aging boomers.

1256379,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00290X6NW,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 5]","This is a fun three-disc set that is very long (five-plus hours) and has some delightful commercials from the past, including ads so early in the Fifties that the Boomers in this house had never encountered them.  The first disc is given over mostly to food, with ready-to-eat breakfast cereals probably the biggest category (interspersed with other highly advertised foods like white bread and canned soup).  Sugar and white bleached flour were indeed pushed to the hilt!The only real problem is that when the commercials shift to color (and they are interspersed with the B&W;), the color is almost always astonishingly garish and distorted.  Did anyone even look at the DVD transfer, even if there was no computer correction?  Ads from the late 60s/early70s glow and forms violate their boundaries beyond the wildest imagination of that era's hippies.  And unlike back then, most of today's TV's will not allow the viewer to dial down the color ""intensity.""In our case, we often remembered the jingles, so the color-monsters didn't get us down.  While this is a very generous package, potential buyers should know that part of it is going to be close to unwatchable.  But then, if you can remember many of these commercials, you probably grew up learning how to ignore the uninteresting ads.  Physical quality was fine.

You'll soon forget that you're watching commercial after commercial as you delve deeper and deeper into a history of popular culture as expressed by the very raison d'tre of American television: commercials, after all, finance the shows that stations air to draw audiences that watch the commercials in the first place.  The commercials are very well organized on each disc, and the collection of PSAs are both fascinating to watch as well as enjoyable.  The quality of the commercials varies from decent to quite poor, but this can only be expected, considering the fact that commercials are generally considered disposable by the industry and are rarely preserved in the same way as television series are.",4,Very enjoyable,1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,796,"['numerous', 'commercials', 'contained', 'DVDs', 'provide', 'hours', 'unexpected', 'enjoyment', ""'ll"", 'soon', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'commercial', 'commercial', 'delve', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'history', 'popular', 'culture', 'expressed', 'very', 'raison', ""d'tre"", 'American', 'television', 'commercials', 'finance', 'shows', 'stations', 'air', 'draw', 'audiences', 'watch', 'commercials', 'first', 'place', 'commercials', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'organized', 'disc', 'collection', 'PSAs', 'are', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'enjoyable', 'quality', 'commercials', 'varies', 'decent', 'quite', 'poor', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'expected', 'considering', 'fact', 'commercials', 'are', 'generally', 'considered', 'disposable', 'industry', 'are', 'rarely', 'preserved', 'same', 'way', 'television', 'series', 'are']",1001 Classic Commercials

This three disk set will likely contain a fair number of the ads that regulars to public domain and retro media sites already have bought before now. But one nice plus this collection has, which the others I have had definitely do not, is a chapter break for each commercial. It's not a complete index of every commercial. It's the ability to hit your remote's chapter advance button and move to the next commercial, one ad at a time, through each disk. This makes cueing specific ads up, or skipping items of less interest to you, much easier than any other collection I've seen. (Most disks on the market seem to be made up of bulk transfers of old ads in 30 to 50 commercial chunks. Much of this material came straight from an online archive of public domain material in this form, and until now, no one has troubled to break it up for easier use.)The video quality is of a very wide range, and some of the images are a mess. But anyone with a passing-to-serious interest in old commercials, or pop culture from the 50s to the 70s, should pick one of these up for general purposes. It pretty much ""retires"" about half the commercial sets I have bought up until now.Note: There's also a section of Drive-In movie promotional films (""Come by our snack bar...""; ""Enjoy our mouthwatering hot buttered popcorn..."") at the end of the third disk.

But the viewer needs to keep in mind that like so much from that era of time, most (if not all) of the commercials were on film and not made with the idea of lasting and becoming the cultural significance they'd ultimately become.  And to be honest, if you're of my age group (53) and mainly looking for the memory factor this is a great collection and for the Amazon price.If you want to show family (grand kids) what things were like in the eras represented in the commercials, I think this collection and the commercials included are an excellent snapshot of the clothes and culture of those times!I grew up in the ""Greater Los Angeles area"" and do recall quite a few of the commercials, especially the toys and games.

1256400,A1QI71TUWQMGD6,B00290X6NW,Kevin Wollenweber,"[3, 8]","This is, perhaps, the best collection of its kind since, on all three of these disks, so much time is given over to really mining the available vaults for some of the rarest of the various advertising libraries, but my desire for collections of this kind leans more toward the classic ""anti-commercial"", that is, the ultimate CLASSIC COMMERCIALS collection for those of us who hate commercials.  Also, I was indeed searching for some TV ads that were omnipresent in my youth of too much TV watching, like the many, many Jay Ward animated ads, the CHOO CHOO CHARLIE ads for Good 'N' Plenty candy, the bizarre and frenetic Mazola Corn Oil ad that follows a woman dashing wildly with a shopping cart, seeking out the ingredients for herself, with the hand-held camera following her every step as the announcer inquires, ""what if you had to search for all the good ingredients found in one bottle of Mazola Corn Oil?...""  It is a little-known ad, now, but it was shown a lot on daytime TV, but it now seems to be so difficult to find.  This collection is also missing some real treats that I'd seen in private collections, like the cereal ads created by Jay Ward or even those around ""LINUS THE LION-HEARTED"" which was technically the very first cartoon show that came off as a half-hour info-mercial for kids.  And one other minor thing that rather put me off about this set is that it seems to dip its toe into political ads of our distant past, but stops at a handful of ads for Eisenhower/Nixon.  Why not explore just about every political party ad in America over the past 50 years?  There have been network and cable TV specials aimed at unintended comedy in classic commercials, but this set seems to sometimes take itself seriously, as more a lesson in advertising instead of allowing us to laugh at ourselves as seen in classic TV ads.  However, this set does give a bit of a peak into all that pop culture, with celebrities hocking all kinds of products, but those vaults are quite deep, and this company really could continue its mining of those vaults like it has mined public domain cartoons.  Either that, or someone please start a zany website aimed at exhausting that library of classic ads for us curious types that would like to visit some of the wildest ads of our youth, some which featured subliminal messages unintended as such and featuring very beautiful women.  I know that filmmakers could learn from some of the camera tricks in the classic ads of which I speak.  The afore-mentioned Mazola ad was very much like it were shot for an old silent comedy with the violent and fast music accompanying the woman's stumbling around and diggging up vast real estate and crop to gather, greedily, the items that she needs.  It is almost like something out of a classic animated cartoon.  If anyone reading this knows where I could find this ad, please let me know.  There were other such ads that have been avoided, like the Goodyear ""Tiger Paws"" tire commercials narrated by the golden voice of Ken Nordine or the yodeling Levi's jeans ad which is an incredible stop motion work of art in the mid-1970's.  Most of these types of ads did make sense and left an indellible image in our minds, but the ads now seem to be gone forever, and it is hard to mine the amounts of DVD's on the market in order to find this stuff, even though most such collections aren't really all that expensive.  Surely, someone must know where the best array of such ads are, outside of the various Museums of Television and Radio broadcasts.  I'd last seen the Ken Nordine ""Tiger Paws"" ads at the Manhattan Museum of Television & Radio, as part of a network airing of an episode of ""VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA"".  Maybe some of the video companies could be persuaded to do what was done with the ""HONEY WEST"" DVD set, include a handful of classic TV ads as special feature on each of the DVD's surrounding the classic TV show in question.  That might be another way of mining those vaults, and these could include the network ads announcing the creation of the TV show being spotlighted.",3,"Too Much Hard Sell, Not Enough Off The Wall!",1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,4083,"['perhaps', 'best', 'collection', 'kind', 'three', 'disks', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'given', 'really', 'mining', 'available', 'vaults', 'rarest', 'various', 'advertising', 'libraries', 'desire', 'collections', 'kind', 'more', 'classic', 'anti-commercial', 'ultimate', 'CLASSIC', 'COMMERCIALS', 'collection', 'who', 'hate', 'commercials', 'Also', 'was', 'indeed', 'searching', 'TV', 'ads', 'were', 'omnipresent', 'youth', 'too', 'much', 'TV', 'watching', 'many', 'many', 'Jay', 'Ward', 'animated', 'ads', 'CHOO', 'CHOO', 'CHARLIE', 'ads', 'Good', 'N', 'Plenty', 'candy', 'bizarre', 'frenetic', 'Mazola', 'Corn', 'Oil', 'ad', 'woman', 'dashing', 'wildly', 'shopping', 'cart', 'seeking', 'out', 'ingredients', 'herself', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'following', 'step', 'announcer', 'what', 'had', 'search', 'good', 'ingredients', 'found', 'one', 'bottle', 'Mazola', 'Corn', 'Oil', 'little-known', 'ad', 'now', 'was', 'shown', 'lot', 'daytime', 'TV', 'now', 'be', 'so', 'difficult', 'find', 'collection', 'also', 'missing', 'real', 'treats', ""'d"", 'seen', 'private', 'collections', 'cereal', 'ads', 'created', 'Jay', 'Ward', 'even', 'LINUS', 'LION-HEARTED', 'was', 'technically', 'very', 'first', 'cartoon', 'show', 'came', 'off', 'half-hour', 'info-mercial', 'kids', 'one', 'other', 'minor', 'thing', 'rather', 'put', 'off', 'set', 'dip', 'toe', 'political', 'ads', 'distant', 'past', 'handful', 'ads', 'Eisenhower/Nixon', 'Why', 'not', 'explore', 'just', 'political', 'party', 'ad', 'America', 'past', '50', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'network', 'cable', 'TV', 'specials', 'aimed', 'unintended', 'comedy', 'classic', 'commercials', 'set', 'sometimes', 'take', 'seriously', 'more', 'lesson', 'advertising', 'instead', 'allowing', 'laugh', 'seen', 'classic', 'TV', 'ads', 'However', 'set', 'give', 'bit', 'peak', 'pop', 'culture', 'celebrities', 'hocking', 'kinds', 'products', 'vaults', 'are', 'quite', 'deep', 'company', 'really', 'could', 'continue', 'mining', 'vaults', 'mined', 'public', 'domain', 'cartoons', 'someone', 'please', 'start', 'zany', 'website', 'aimed', 'exhausting', 'library', 'classic', 'ads', 'curious', 'types', 'would', 'like', 'visit', 'wildest', 'ads', 'youth', 'featured', 'subliminal', 'messages', 'unintended', 'such', 'featuring', 'very', 'beautiful', 'women', 'know', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'learn', 'camera', 'classic', 'ads', 'speak', 'afore-mentioned', 'Mazola', 'ad', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'were', 'shot', 'old', 'silent', 'comedy', 'violent', 'fast', 'music', 'accompanying', 'woman', 'stumbling', 'around', 'diggging', 'up', 'vast', 'real', 'estate', 'crop', 'gather', 'greedily', 'items', 'almost', 'something', 'classic', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'anyone', 'reading', 'where', 'could', 'find', 'ad', 'please', 'let', 'know', 'were', 'other', 'such', 'ads', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'Goodyear', 'Tiger', 'Paws', 'tire', 'commercials', 'narrated', 'golden', 'voice', 'Ken', 'Nordine', 'yodeling', 'Levi', 'jeans', 'ad', 'incredible', 'stop', 'motion', 'work', 'art', 'mid-1970', 'Most', 'types', 'ads', 'did', 'make', 'sense', 'left', 'indellible', 'image', 'minds', 'ads', 'now', 'seem', 'be', 'gone', 'forever', 'hard', 'mine', 'amounts', 'DVD', 'market', 'order', 'find', 'stuff', 'even', 'most', 'such', 'collections', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'expensive', 'Surely', 'someone', 'must', 'know', 'where', 'best', 'array', 'such', 'ads', 'are', 'various', 'Museums', 'Television', 'Radio', 'broadcasts', ""'d"", 'last', 'seen', 'Ken', 'Nordine', 'Tiger', 'Paws', 'ads', 'Manhattan', 'Museum', 'Television', 'Radio', 'part', 'network', 'airing', 'episode', 'VOYAGE', 'TO', 'THE', 'BOTTOM', 'THE', 'SEA', 'Maybe', 'video', 'companies', 'could', 'be', 'persuaded', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'HONEY', 'WEST', 'DVD', 'set', 'include', 'handful', 'classic', 'TV', 'ads', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'surrounding', 'classic', 'TV', 'show', 'question', 'might', 'be', 'way', 'mining', 'vaults', 'could', 'include', 'network', 'ads', 'announcing', 'creation', 'TV', 'show', 'being', 'spotlighted']",1001 Classic Commercials

1256416,A2PA9ACXDNHFID,B00290X6NW,Scott M,"[0, 0]",Great concept - Poorly executed!! At least they are organized by category - other than that - there are NO references to When these were made - not even a year. No history - just here are a bunch of commercials. Not much of a menu - and when I select one category - it automatically goes to the following one afterwards - without announcing what it is.The commercials are a mixture of black and white and color. My main beef is No one did ANY restoration. Some commercials are crystal clear - while others are so blurry - I could barely make them out.There are indeed some fun ones to see - Flintstones and other classics.I would have loved if there were some sort of alternate audio - hearing commentary about the times and situations. Who did the voice overs. I picked this up for about $5.00 - and it might be worth that much.I'm sure some people did a lot to get all these commercials together - but they didn't finish the job of adding ANY information - if is up to the viewer to know the history.I would prefer a documentary about the history of TV commercials - and how they evolved.
