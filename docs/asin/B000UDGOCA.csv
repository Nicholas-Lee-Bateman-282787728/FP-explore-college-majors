1094829,A21Q9JVG4SII51,B000UDGOCA,electronics guy,"[1, 2]","I recently saw an episode of Creature Comforts on Animal Planet and was amazed at how it captured people - people just being themselves, interacting as couples, or pondering life's complexities and issues. When I searched for it on Amazon, the original Creature Comforts series (British) came up and I ordered the 1st and 2nd season package. It was wonderful!But I also realized it wasn't exactly what I had seen on Animal Planet. That was a more American version. So back to Amazon to search some more. My copy of Creature Comforts America arrived yesterday.Even if you aren't into animation, the episodes in this DVD set are great! There are so many great one-liners and exchanges, with really funny sight gags, it's pretty much guaranteed to have most everyone laughing out loud.My favorite episode (so far) is the one with fear and raising children. But then there are other interviews in the other segments that are instant classics - the two dogs actually commenting about wine but who are depicted as sniffing another dog's rear or drinking out of the toilet, the mom and daughter pigs discussing whether her piglets are special good or special bad. It just goes on and on.And this isn't animation for kids - the jokes are all targeted at adults (it's all unscripted commentary from regular people - the jokes just come naturally). But none of the humor is outside the realm of what's acceptable for kids (some may disagree about the dogs sniffing the other's rear but it is done in good taste) and I think children of various age groups will key on different aspects and enjoy this too.All of the Creature Comforts are excellent and I am so glad I discovered them. I am sad to hear that Creature Comforts America was canceled, though. I wish I could look forward to more seasons on DVD. Hopefully a network will pick this back up. It is just too inventive and entertaining not to.So if you want a break from blow things up, kill people, blood, gore, and terror movies, try something that will leave you laughing and wanting to watch it again to be able to discover all the sight gags in the backgrounds or pick up on other nuances. The Creature Comforts, both American and British, are wonderful fun for the whole family. I can't recommend them enough.",5,Even if you aren't a fan of animation...,1210809600,"05 15, 2008",2008,2260,"['recently', 'saw', 'episode', 'Creature', 'Comforts', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'captured', 'people', 'people', 'just', 'being', 'interacting', 'couples', 'pondering', 'life', 'complexities', 'issues', 'When', 'searched', 'Amazon', 'original', 'Creature', 'Comforts', 'series', 'British', 'came', 'up', 'ordered', '1st', '2nd', 'season', 'package', 'was', 'wonderful', 'also', 'realized', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'was', 'more', 'American', 'version', 'So', 'back', 'Amazon', 'search', 'more', 'copy', 'Creature', 'Comforts', 'America', 'arrived', 'yesterday.Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'animation', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'one-liners', 'exchanges', 'really', 'funny', 'sight', 'gags', 'pretty', 'much', 'guaranteed', 'have', 'most', 'everyone', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud.My', 'favorite', 'episode', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'fear', 'raising', 'children', 'then', 'are', 'other', 'interviews', 'other', 'segments', 'are', 'instant', 'classics', 'two', 'dogs', 'actually', 'commenting', 'wine', 'who', 'are', 'depicted', 'sniffing', 'dog', 'rear', 'drinking', 'toilet', 'mom', 'daughter', 'pigs', 'discussing', 'piglets', 'are', 'special', 'good', 'special', 'bad', 'just', 'on.And', ""n't"", 'animation', 'kids', 'jokes', 'are', 'targeted', 'adults', 'unscripted', 'commentary', 'regular', 'people', 'jokes', 'just', 'come', 'naturally', 'none', 'humor', 'realm', 'what', 'acceptable', 'kids', 'may', 'disagree', 'dogs', 'sniffing', 'other', 'rear', 'done', 'good', 'taste', 'think', 'children', 'various', 'age', 'groups', 'will', 'key', 'different', 'aspects', 'enjoy', 'too.All', 'Creature', 'Comforts', 'are', 'excellent', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'discovered', 'am', 'sad', 'hear', 'Creature', 'Comforts', 'America', 'was', 'canceled', 'wish', 'could', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'Hopefully', 'network', 'will', 'pick', 'back', 'up', 'just', 'too', 'inventive', 'entertaining', 'not', 'to.So', 'want', 'break', 'blow', 'things', 'up', 'kill', 'people', 'blood', 'gore', 'terror', 'movies', 'try', 'something', 'will', 'leave', 'laughing', 'wanting', 'watch', 'again', 'be', 'able', 'discover', 'sight', 'gags', 'backgrounds', 'pick', 'up', 'other', 'nuances', 'Creature', 'Comforts', 'American', 'British', 'are', 'wonderful', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'enough']",Creature Comforts America: Season 1
1094830,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B000UDGOCA,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[15, 16]","One evening while surfing the channels on my television, I stumbled on an episode of this show of ""Creature Comforts America"".  Being an extreme fan of the British version of this program, I came to a stop ending my channel surfing for a time.  As a previous reviewer on this board so succinctly wrote, these are NOT really cartoons for the kids; however, they are very funny Claymation cartoons really for GROWNUPS!  In this American version, the creatures have wonderfully varying American accents that are hysterical plus they are being asked questions that could be considered more relevant to our country or more particularly ""American"" questions--some being taken from the news in the USA.  I particularly love the Claymation character of the snake that has just swallowed the cat along with the horny panda bears--all are hysterical.  I am just so very glad that they have released season one on DVD and I am also so very sad that there won't be anymore releases due to the show's cancellation because it is indeed so very funny.",5,NOT FOR THE KIDDIES,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,1036,"['One', 'evening', 'surfing', 'channels', 'television', 'stumbled', 'episode', 'show', 'Creature', 'Comforts', 'America', 'Being', 'extreme', 'fan', 'British', 'version', 'program', 'came', 'stop', 'ending', 'channel', 'surfing', 'time', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'board', 'so', 'succinctly', 'wrote', 'are', 'NOT', 'really', 'cartoons', 'kids', 'however', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'Claymation', 'cartoons', 'really', 'GROWNUPS', 'American', 'version', 'creatures', 'have', 'wonderfully', 'varying', 'American', 'accents', 'are', 'hysterical', 'are', 'being', 'asked', 'questions', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'more', 'relevant', 'country', 'more', 'particularly', 'American', 'questions', 'being', 'taken', 'news', 'USA', 'particularly', 'love', 'Claymation', 'character', 'snake', 'just', 'swallowed', 'cat', 'horny', 'panda', 'bears', 'are', 'hysterical', 'am', 'just', 'so', 'very', 'glad', 'have', 'released', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'am', 'also', 'so', 'very', 'sad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'anymore', 'releases', 'due', 'show', 'cancellation', 'indeed', 'so', 'very', 'funny']",Creature Comforts America: Season 1

What surprised me, though, was just how much funnier this American series seemed to me than the BBC version!  I'm a long-time fan of British comedy (everything from Fawlty Towers to Monty Python to Spaced to Mr. Bean to The Office), but for some reason this American edition just kept me laughing the entire time, whereas the British version had more spaced out laughs.Intact in this version are the hilarious sight-gags in the background, the delightful design of the animals, and the hilarious juxtaposition of human responses coupled with non-human settings.I watched both of the episodes as they aired, and was so disappointed to hear that the series had been canceled immediately thereafter.  I was very surprised, actually, because a lot of my friends had watched the show on their own and loved it just as much as I had.  I don't know if they didn't advertise it enough or what, but everyone I showed it too later thought it was great, so I wish they'd given it more of a chance.
