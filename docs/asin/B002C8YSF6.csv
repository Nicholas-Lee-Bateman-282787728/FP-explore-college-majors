Willa Ford is excellent as the poor desperate stripper, formerly Vicky Lynn Hogan, who meets oil tycoon Howard Marshall. There is a touching chemistry between the two of them. He offers to rescue her by hiring a nanny to care for her son, Daniel, and proposes marriage while encouraging her to believe in herself. She is chosen to model for Playboy and life tumbles from that point on. Daniel becomes addicted to Zoloft without a father to care for him and the constant barrage of media attention given to his mom. I just wish a few more details could be covered in this quickie TV picture and a less of a heavy handed G-rated edit used in terms of relationships. Very sad and a real tear jerker.",5,"Excellent, absorbing biographical drama",1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,734,"['Bring', 'crying', 'towel', 'one', 'Willa', 'Ford', 'excellent', 'poor', 'desperate', 'stripper', 'formerly', 'Vicky', 'Lynn', 'Hogan', 'who', 'oil', 'tycoon', 'Howard', 'Marshall', 'touching', 'chemistry', 'two', 'rescue', 'hiring', 'nanny', 'care', 'son', 'Daniel', 'marriage', 'encouraging', 'believe', 'chosen', 'model', 'Playboy', 'life', 'tumbles', 'point', 'Daniel', 'becomes', 'addicted', 'Zoloft', 'father', 'care', 'constant', 'barrage', 'media', 'attention', 'given', 'mom', 'just', 'wish', 'few', 'more', 'details', 'could', 'be', 'covered', 'quickie', 'TV', 'picture', 'less', 'heavy', 'handed', 'G-rated', 'edit', 'used', 'terms', 'relationships', 'Very', 'sad', 'real', 'tear', 'jerker']",N/A

Shortly after her appearance on that show, she started work on this movie. I'm not really sure why this movie was never shown at the movie theaters or on TV? - lol - After 2 years, it's finally coming out straight to DVD. I'm sure this movie will be as much of a train wreck as Ms. Smith's life. I'm also sure that it will be thought of in the future as a cult classic. That's why I'm buying it. From what clips I remember seeing on (Entertainment Tonight), It seemed like Ms. Ford did a good job impersonating the look and sound of Ms. Anna. I can't wait to receive this DVD in the mail, so I can experience it for myself. Even if its bad it will be good. Just like Anna Nicole herself. Don't get me wrong, it's very sad how her life ended. There is nothing funny about that. I'm just saying that she was larger than life and I'm sure this movie will be the same. How could it not be? If you didn't know it was a true story, you would think that it had to be fiction. I give it 4 stars just for what it is - A fun trashy movie!!!UPDATE!I thought I'd add to this review after watching the movie.-lol-This movie mainly suffered from a bad script. There was far to much drama in Ms. Anna's life to cram into one 90 minute movie. Here are a few of the films problems. There was no mention of her first husband or any of her family. Her relationship with her mother would have been interesting. It also showed very little of her partnership with (Howard K. Stern). No reenactments from or any mention of her movies. Not even her embarrassing speech at the music awards. Very little shown about the fight over (Howard Marshall's) money. (Willa Ford) did a fine job with her performance especially in the second part of the movie after Ms. Anna gained weight. I don't know where the films producers were trying to market this movie. It surly wasn't of major film quality and was way to racy for mainstream TV. Since this film wasn't rated, I was surprised that it had nudity and colorful language. The tackiest thing about this movie I thought, was that (Bobby Trendy) took the role of playing himself. I still think Ms. Anna's story would make a great movie. This just doesn't happen to be it. Either way it's still a fun trashy movie.",4,OH ANNA!,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,2330,"['movie', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Willa', 'Ford', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'Shortly', 'appearance', 'show', 'started', 'work', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'shown', 'movie', 'theaters', 'TV', 'lol', '2', 'years', 'finally', 'coming', 'out', 'straight', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'sure', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'train', 'wreck', 'Ms.', 'Smith', 'life', ""'m"", 'also', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'thought', 'future', 'cult', 'classic', 'why', ""'m"", 'buying', 'what', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Entertainment', 'Tonight', 'seemed', 'Ms.', 'Ford', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'impersonating', 'look', 'sound', 'Ms.', 'Anna', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'receive', 'DVD', 'mail', 'can', 'experience', 'Even', 'bad', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'Just', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'very', 'sad', 'how', 'life', 'ended', 'nothing', 'funny', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'was', 'larger', 'life', ""'m"", 'sure', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'same', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'would', 'think', 'had', 'be', 'fiction', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'just', 'what', 'fun', 'trashy', 'movie', 'UPDATE', 'thought', ""'d"", 'add', 'review', 'watching', 'movie.-lol-This', 'movie', 'mainly', 'suffered', 'bad', 'script', 'was', 'far', 'much', 'drama', 'Ms.', 'Anna', 'life', 'cram', 'one', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'problems', 'was', 'mention', 'first', 'husband', 'family', 'relationship', 'mother', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'also', 'showed', 'very', 'little', 'partnership', 'Howard', 'K.', 'Stern', 'No', 'reenactments', 'mention', 'movies', 'Not', 'even', 'embarrassing', 'speech', 'music', 'awards', 'Very', 'little', 'shown', 'fight', 'Howard', 'Marshall', 'money', 'Willa', 'Ford', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'performance', 'especially', 'second', 'part', 'movie', 'Ms.', 'Anna', 'gained', 'weight', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'films', 'producers', 'were', 'trying', 'market', 'movie', 'surly', 'was', ""n't"", 'major', 'film', 'quality', 'was', 'way', 'racy', 'mainstream', 'TV', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'rated', 'was', 'surprised', 'had', 'nudity', 'colorful', 'language', 'tackiest', 'thing', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'Bobby', 'Trendy', 'took', 'role', 'playing', 'still', 'think', 'Ms.', 'Anna', 'story', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'happen', 'be', 'way', 'still', 'fun', 'trashy', 'movie']",N/A

This movie jumped ahead so quickly you could barely keep up with it, (which actually, considering, the production, and acting, may have been doing us all a favour). I have never heard of Willa Ford before, and I don't think I'll be searching out her movies in the future, although I have to admit that bar the early scenes in the bad curly wig, she does look quite a bit like Anna Nicole. I was never especially a fan of the woman, but I was hoping for some insight into her life beyond the superficial, and this movie barely even touches on that let alone anything deeper. The older man she married is portrayed as a kindly old thing with barely a hint of the actual relationship they had, her son Daniel goes from child to depressed teen in about five minutes.
