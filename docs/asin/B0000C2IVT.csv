773177,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0000C2IVT,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Little House on the Prairie - Season 3The original nine books could never have provided enough material for the nine TV seasons. New stories were created that continued the original characters, as with other TV shows. The real question is: how authentically did they follow the original stories? Some fans of the original books were disappointed by these TV adaptions. New characters were introduced. Hollywood changes books to condense and simplify them to fit into the allotted time slots and reach a wider audience. These books were written in the mid 1930s from her personal experiences which no historian can match. Laura lost her savings in the Great Depression. An adult who reads Laura's books can see things that a teenager may miss. The economic depressions of their era are referenced implicitly by the family migrations. Young Laura would have little knowledge of these problems. An older Laura censored events that were not suitable for children's books. This was NBC's highest rated series during most of its nine years. Here are the titles of the twenty-three shows.Disc 1.The Collection.  I'll Ride the Wind.The Race.  Bunny.Disc 2.The Monster of Walnut Grove. Journey in the Spring. Part One.Journey in the Spring Part Two. Fred.Disc 3.The Bully Boys.  The Hunters.Blizzard.Disc 4.Little Girl Lost.

773179,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B0000C2IVT,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[1, 1]","Season three is definitely in improvement over season's one and two...let me correct that, the DVD release of season three is in improvement over season's one and two. Scene selections have finally been added and there are...well tolerable bonus features, cast members share there their memories...in the form of notes. It would have been a lot nicer watching interviews instead of reading notes, I could buy a book to do that but overall the effort put into the season releases has increased. But not everything is fantastic about this set, I have to agree with other reviewers that sometimes the transitions from one scene to the next are awful, but otherwise I enjoyed this release. I also think the packaging is much better, I miss the photographs from the previous releases and all but the DVD's from season one fell out of the DVD case numerous times and got scratched up, season three's DVD case is much better because the discs are treated more carefully. There also is a pamphlet that includes each episode synopsis so you can find the episode you're looking for easily.Season three of Little House includes nineteen episodes on six discs, and like usual are absolutely terrific. There are many episodes focused on Laura and Mary in season three, but one of my favorites is not about them, it's called ""Wisdom of Solomon"" which is about a young black boy who runs away from his family because he's tired of being treated differently. I found this episode interesting, there have been many advancements since the days of the Ingalls, women had more rights and technology had advanced, but the racist attitude still lingered with some  people in the 70's, (and even in this present day) and this episode may have made them stop and think, it really is a deep episode from the series.To wrap things up, season three is terrific, and it's highly recommended to any Little House fan, flaws and all this set is a must have.",4,Little House on the Prairie - Season Three,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,1926,"['Season', 'three', 'definitely', 'improvement', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'let', 'correct', 'DVD', 'release', 'season', 'three', 'improvement', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'Scene', 'selections', 'have', 'finally', 'been', 'added', 'are', 'well', 'tolerable', 'bonus', 'features', 'cast', 'members', 'share', 'memories', 'form', 'notes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'watching', 'interviews', 'instead', 'reading', 'notes', 'could', 'buy', 'book', 'do', 'effort', 'put', 'season', 'increased', 'not', 'everything', 'fantastic', 'set', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'transitions', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'are', 'awful', 'otherwise', 'enjoyed', 'release', 'also', 'think', 'packaging', 'much', 'better', 'miss', 'photographs', 'previous', 'releases', 'DVD', 'season', 'one', 'fell', 'DVD', 'case', 'numerous', 'times', 'got', 'scratched', 'up', 'season', 'three', 'DVD', 'case', 'much', 'better', 'discs', 'are', 'treated', 'more', 'carefully', 'also', 'pamphlet', 'episode', 'synopsis', 'can', 'find', 'episode', ""'re"", 'looking', 'easily.Season', 'three', 'Little', 'House', 'nineteen', 'episodes', 'six', 'discs', 'usual', 'are', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'are', 'many', 'episodes', 'focused', 'Laura', 'Mary', 'season', 'three', 'one', 'favorites', 'not', 'called', 'Wisdom', 'Solomon', 'young', 'black', 'boy', 'who', 'away', 'family', 'tired', 'being', 'treated', 'differently', 'found', 'episode', 'interesting', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'advancements', 'days', 'Ingalls', 'women', 'had', 'more', 'rights', 'technology', 'had', 'advanced', 'racist', 'attitude', 'still', 'lingered', 'people', '70', 'even', 'present', 'day', 'episode', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'stop', 'think', 'really', 'deep', 'episode', 'series.To', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'season', 'three', 'terrific', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Little', 'House', 'fan', 'flaws', 'set', 'must', 'have']",N/A
773180,A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4,B0000C2IVT,Brandon L. Harlow,"[6, 7]",This season had some of the best remembered and fun episodes! The music box drama featuring Laura being forced to turn on her stuttering friend (that Nellie Oleson was such a fun brat!) to Pa mining the liquid dynamite to lil Carrie falling down a well (if only they had left her!).

It stinks!  Many of the episodes are bleached (color-wise) and blurred.  Looks like they confiscated some used video-tapes and did a transfer using a consumer-end VCR with no digital enhancement other than adding chapters (one thing that was nicer than Seasons 1 & 2).  And even the transition on some chapters is noticeablely chopped (almost like some one stopped the playback while still recording).  My guess is that the studio's greed set in and they decided to accelerate the production timeline for Season 3 and get these out on the market at the sacrifice of quality so they bring in those $$$ faster.  For such a wonderful series as this is, it is a crying shame to see such a low quality transfer to DVD as Season 3 is.  I purchased Seasons 4 & 5 which I have not yet viewed.

More than likely these will look better than they ever have on cable.Seasons 1 and 2 did except for a small amount of shows that had a lot of grain.Hopefully the small amount of problems with the grain won't be in season 3.Also as with season 1 and 2 season 3's seasons will be uncut.,5,Little House On The Prairie,1063497600,"09 14, 2003",2003,2254,"['prehaps', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'little', 'house', 'prairie.A', 'lot', 'favorites', 'are', 'season.This', 'will', 'be', 'six', 'disc', 'collection', 'will', 'include', 'following', 'episodes:1', 'Collection2', ""'ll"", 'Ride', 'Wind3', 'Race4', 'Bunny5', 'Monster', 'Walnut', 'Grove-Laura', 'see', 'Mr.Olson', 'cut', 'off', 'Mrs.Olsons', 'head.Also', 'headless', 'horseman', 'seen', 'end', 'episode.This', 'great', 'show', 'put', 'Halloween', 'music', 'scary', 'too.This', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'was', 'wanting', 'see', 'dvd.6', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Spring', 'Part', '17', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Spring', 'Part', '28', 'Fred-This', 'one', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'little', 'house', 'shows.Laura', 'trys', 'get', 'rid', 'goat', 'called', 'Fred', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anyone', 'take', 'it.This', 'goat', 'funny', 'everybody', 'Bully', 'Boys1O', 'Hunters11', 'Blizzard-This', 'actually', 'Christmas', 'show.A', 'lot', 'residents', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'get', 'trapped', 'school', 'snowstorm.This', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes.12', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Lost13', 'Quarantine14', 'Little', 'Women15', 'Injun', 'Kid16', 'Live', 'Fear', 'Part', '117', 'Live', 'Fear', 'Part', '218', 'Wisdom', 'Solomon19', 'Music', 'Box20', 'Election21', 'Gold', 'CountryIf', 'fan', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'should', 'pick', 'upseason', '3.It', 'worth', 'just', 'Fred', 'episode', 'very', 'funny', 'also', 'got', 'lot', 'other', 'great', 'episodes', 'frequently', 'shown', 'wtbs.Shows', 'are', 'great', 'watch', 'focus', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'people', 'put', 'God', 'firstand', 'are', 'clean', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'foul', 'language', 'adult', 'situations', 'them.You', 'can', 'let', 'children', 'watch', 'having', 'worry', 'warping', 'there', 'mind.I', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'continully', 'have', 'press', 'mute', 'button', 'remote', 'mute', 'out', 'cursing.I', 'also', 'recommend', 'little', 'house', 'prairie', 'season', '1', '2', 'have', 'too', 'think', 'pretty', 'good.Imavision', 'will', 'release', 'seasons', 'little', 'house', 'dvd', 'even', 'reunion', 'More', 'likely', 'will', 'look', 'better', 'ever', 'have', 'cable.Seasons', '1', '2', 'did', 'small', 'amount', 'shows', 'had', 'lot', 'grain.Hopefully', 'small', 'amount', 'problems', 'grain', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'season', '3.Also', 'season', '1', '2', 'season', '3', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'uncut']",N/A

773196,A8SAQKS3S43NO,B0000C2IVT,K. Harkins,"[12, 14]","[For the record: this is actually Andrea Shettle, using my partner's Amazon account because I don't yet have one of my own.  However, this complaint comes from both of us.]I first became hooked on the Little House series in the early 1980s when the last two seasons were closed captioned.  As a Deaf person, I was unable to watch Little House before that point because I rely on captions to understand television.  (To give you an idea of how important closed captions are for most deaf people: most deaf people I know did not even own a television set until 1980, when closed captions were first invented.  There was simply no point in owning a television set before then.  Hearing people ""discovered"" television in the 1950s; deaf people did not ""discover"" television until the 1980s.  A television program or movie without captions for a deaf person is essentially the same as a building with only steps and no ramp for a wheelchair user: a deaf person simply CANNOT ACCESS a television program without captions any more than a wheelchair rider can access a building without ramps.)In the past few years, I discovered that the Little House series had come out on DVD at reasonable prices.  Over the years, I gradually bought (or had purchased for me as Xmas and birthday gifts) seasons four through nine, as all of these seasons were available with closed captions.  And I have loved all the seasons four through nine.  But I really missed having seen the first three seasons.  I looked for them in stores, but whenever I found them, they were not labeled as having closed captions.  So I asked for them for Xmas this year in the hope that maybe one of my relatives could find them on line somewhere with captions.The information at Amazon CLAIMS that the 3rd season has closed captions.  My partner ordered the 3rd season of Little House for me based on this information.  But when it arrived, there was no closed captioning label on the box.  My partner then checked the reviews on line and found other comments complaining about the lack of captions.  She became concerned and gave me the dvd early so I could check it for captions.  To my disappointment, I found that there are indeed NO CAPTIONS on the 3rd season of Little House.I am 37 years old.  I have been waiting for a QUARTER CENTURY -- more than two-thirds of my life--in order to watch the first three seasons of Little House on the Prairie.  The producers of the Little House series DVDs have essentially hung a sign on the first three seasons that say, ""These DVDs are for hearing people only.  Deaf people can just go away and stew because we don't value you enough to bother making this product accessible to you.""And Amazon, for its part, has been misleading customers who are deaf or who have auditory processing disorder (a completely separate disability in which a person can hear but hears things in a garbled way) or who otherwise DEPEND on captions to understand television.  Amazon also misleads customers who are hard of hearing (these are 10 percent of the population, when you count elderly people who lose their hearing as they age--think of your great-grandparents who always turn up the volume on their television set!), or who learn English as a second language -- these are people who can get by without captions if they have to but still find it MUCH EASIER and MUCH more relaxing and enjoyable to watch television if they are able to use captions.Amazon needs to understand that some customers MUST, MUST, MUST have FULLY ACCURATE information on what products have captions and what do not.  Think of how you would feel as a hearing person if you bought a product on the assumption that the sound track was fully intact -- only to find after it arrived that the sound track had been completely stripped away, meaning you no longer have access to any of the dialogue!  That is EXACTLY what it is like for a deaf person to receive a product without closed captions.Amazon needs to learn to DOUBLE CHECK (and triple and quadruple check) the accuracy of information relating to closed captions with the producer for each product individually.  Lots of work?  Yup.  But I'm sure Amazon must already invest a lot of time, labor, and expense double checking OTHER information that they value, such as pricing information, or information about bonus features on their DVDs.  If they understood the importance of accurate information on closed captioning for their customers they would do better about INTEGRATING the process of double-checking the relevant information with whatever process they do for double checking other information that they consider important.It would also be a big plus if Amazon would do a little advocacy by helping to remind DVD producers that closed captioning are CRITICAL for many viewers.  Amazon could help pressure DVD producers to1. Double check their own information (because sometimes they get it wrong on their end -- Amazon cannot give accurate information if the producers are not scrupulous in their OWN record keeping)2. Put closed captions on ALL THEIR PRODUCTS.  And NOT just the primary features.  They should ALSO caption all BONUS features where relevant.  (If I'm paying just as much as hearing people do when I buy a DVD then I dang well ought to be able to RECEIVE the same product as hearing people do.  But if half the material on the DVD has no captions then I'm only receiving half the product.  If it's not captioned then it's worthless to me.)Amazon, are you listening?  Producers of the Little House series DVDs, are YOU listening?  Or will this comment drop into a black hole, leaving deaf people behind--once again--as third class citizens when it comes to enjoying television?",1,Discrimination Against Deaf Viewers from Little

Which is why I rated this 2 stars.Although if it were possible, I would have rated Season 1 with NO Stars and Season 3 with one Star. Unfortunately, there is no such option. Thus, this is rated 2 stars, though I don't believe it truly deserves that, and 1 star would have been more accurate. However since this set is marginally better than Season 1, it deserves a better rating.This set was also a REAL DISAPPOINTMENT! As I said in my review for Season 1, poor Michael Landon would be spinning in his grave if he could see the horrible way that Goldhill Home Media and ImaVision Studios have handled the DVD release of his wonderful series.Michael Landon was a man of honor, respect and integrity, and he would be appalled at the release of these inferior and sub-standard DVD's!SHAME on Goldhill Home Media and ImaVision Studios!In the words that several characters on Little House on the Prairie have used, the people who released this shoddy excuse for a Season DVD set, ""should be horsewhipped!""These DVDs have AWFUL sound quality, and worse, no closed captions to help decipher the characters soft mumbling. There are MASSIVE scenes cut too!DVD's are generally supposed to ADD scenes to DVD releases, in the form of including deleted scenes and extra scenes. Instead, these Little House sets not only don't have added scenes, they are even missing scenes from the syndicated version!There are very few Special Features, nothing that stands out as really noteworthy. There are NO foreign language tracks, and NO commentaries by ANY of the stars like Melissa Gilbert, Karen Grassle, Melissa Sue Anderson, or any of the producers, writers or directors. I know that Michael Landon (Charles Ingalls) and Victor French (Isaiah Edwards) are both deceased, but they still could have included some previous footage or interviews.

773203,A2PSXK2BR7VCIQ,B0000C2IVT,Ms. G. R. Connors,"[8, 9]","Series three of 'Little House on the Prairie' is one of my favorites, possibly because this is the first that I watched all the way through on its original airing, being a bit slow to catch on, and having missed most of the episodes in the earlier series.Although there have been several opportunities to record them on VHS from broadcasts here in the UK over the years, I never actually kept any of them.  I wish I had now as this DVD set, aside from the beautiful packaging, is not exactly a labor of love is it?  Like many reviewers have pointed out, quite a few of the episodes are either of poor quality and/or are edited.Take episodes in this set like ""I'll Ride the Wind"", ""Journey in the Spring"" or ""Little Girl Lost"" which are top quality, and compare them with ""Fred"", which is very washed out and has two scenes missing, where the goat is discovered eating Mary's essay in the schoolhouse for example.Some episodes are out of order.  ""Bunny"" is obviously an earlier story than ""The Race"".  If I remember correctly, ""Bunny"" was the first episode of series three that was broadcast on Thames TV in the UK.  Is the DVD order what was broadcast in the US?  If so then it needs to be looked into, as viewers of a continuing series like this do tend to watch the episodes in the order that they are presented on the DVDs and will become confused if there are lapses in continuity.These episodes do not appear to have been remastered from the original film negatives.  Instead they look like straight copies from analogue ex broadcast television station tapes.  The good copies included in these boxsets look identical to what was broadcast on the UKs Channel 4 network around 1992.  I work in television broadcasting in the UK and certainly in times of old, poor technical quality would have been rejected immediately.  But it seems that these days anything goes!So who is to blame?  Worldvision are the distributors of 'Little House' and would probably have supplied the DVD/video company with these poor masters.
