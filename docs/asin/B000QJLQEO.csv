I've wanted to check out his whole oeuvre for some time so I gave it a viewing. He's not in the film much though, and is not listed as a producer or director. He is the principal questioner in several of these sequences. It may have been Ridgeway or Rafferty, but one of the guys he worked under recounted working with Moore and telling him that the director should never be present onscreen in his film. Then, after contemplating his former advisee's success, stated that he thought it was incorrect.I don't think it was though. We see why he was right in Blood in the Face. The product itself is a thoughtful, fair, and technically strong documentary which places it miles about Moore's works as his are mockumentaries. The director lets the subjects tell their own story. Here we have no manipulation, and we don't feel like we're being slimed. The dispassionate, legitimate approach to filmmaking is one that Moore would be wise to reexamine in my estimation.Furthermore, with this topic there was really no reason to embellish. Bohlen and Rafferty let the paranoiacs tell the tale and it is pretty pathetic. Who needs to embellish when you're working with the cast of Conspiracy Theories? I found it both depressing and sad. However, folks like these are real outliers in society and are regularly watched and harassed by the FBI--something that cannot be said about plenty of other hate groups. Their dreams are foolish and do not appeal to their con-specifics. They certainly don't speak for me or anyone else I've ever met, but I do wish Moore would take a look at his past and practice some objectivity when making his films.",4,Old School Documentary,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,1871,"['other', 'reviewer', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'post', 'moment', 'too', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'watching', 'one', 'documentaries', 'concerning', 'saw', 'clip', 'interviewing', 'storm', 'trooper', 'Blood', 'Face', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'check', 'out', 'whole', 'oeuvre', 'time', 'gave', 'viewing', 'not', 'film', 'much', 'not', 'listed', 'producer', 'director', 'principal', 'questioner', 'several', 'sequences', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Ridgeway', 'Rafferty', 'one', 'guys', 'worked', 'recounted', 'working', 'Moore', 'telling', 'director', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'present', 'onscreen', 'film', 'Then', 'contemplating', 'former', 'advisee', 'success', 'stated', 'thought', 'was', 'incorrect.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'though', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'right', 'Blood', 'Face', 'product', 'thoughtful', 'fair', 'technically', 'strong', 'documentary', 'miles', 'Moore', 'works', 'are', 'mockumentaries', 'director', 'subjects', 'tell', 'own', 'story', 'Here', 'have', 'manipulation', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'being', 'slimed', 'dispassionate', 'legitimate', 'approach', 'filmmaking', 'one', 'Moore', 'would', 'be', 'wise', 'reexamine', 'estimation.Furthermore', 'topic', 'was', 'really', 'reason', 'embellish', 'Bohlen', 'Rafferty', 'let', 'paranoiacs', 'tell', 'tale', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'Who', 'embellish', 'when', ""'re"", 'working', 'cast', 'Conspiracy', 'Theories', 'found', 'depressing', 'sad', 'However', 'folks', 'are', 'real', 'outliers', 'society', 'are', 'regularly', 'watched', 'harassed', 'FBI', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'plenty', 'other', 'hate', 'groups', 'dreams', 'are', 'foolish', 'do', 'not', 'appeal', 'con-specifics', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'anyone', 'else', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'met', 'do', 'wish', 'Moore', 'would', 'take', 'look', 'past', 'practice', 'objectivity', 'when', 'making', 'films']",N/A

That anger soon gave way to amusement as they spewed forth their twisted and ridiculously illogical form of Christianity/racialism. Ultimately though, that humor gave way to sadness. I started to feel sorry for these deluded bumpkins and their misguided cause. Their ignorance was disheartening as was their evil. Imagine an aging group of poorly educated and heavily armed people clinging desperately to a bankrupt philosophy based only on what they've read rather than what they've encountered. Now imagine them being informed by some kind of ridiculous messianic mission involving saving the white race and their country. Not so funny now, is it? Its like watching 65 year old Star Wars geeks sitting in the basement waving their home made light sabers waiting for the return of Darth Vader. Just sad, except these geeks are willing to commit acts of real violence in the name of their cause. The movie lets the kooks speak for themselves with no narration and little intervention from the film makers other than editing.

But he is nowhere to be found anywhere in the film - except in the closing credits. It's difficult to believe that this film is for real as a documenary. Seldom have I been so depressed as after seeing the 78 minutes. Such an unsavory collection of social misfits speaking bad English with an occasional few words of fake German!  How bizzare! A bust of Adolf Hitler and assorted Nazi memorbilia having little rational sense. Some of the worst parts were the depictions of preachers speaking with miniscule coherence. I had hoped for a higher level of exactly where the folks in the film were with some explanation of where they came from and where they intended to go.  Not at all clear. It is hard to give an award for ""most obnoxious character"" because there are so many of them. Although I lack formal training in documentary film evaluation, with all respect, the preachers quoting the bible in this film are top contenders. WHEW.

1076354,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B000QJLQEO,Kerry Walters,"[8, 11]","In ""Heart of Darkness,"" Joseph Conrad's character Kurtz's famous dying words are ""The horror!  The horror!""  Kurtz has looked into the face of evil, and the experience was so explosive that it destroyed him.Conrad's characterization of evil as a mysterious, implacable, overwhelming, consciously malevolent ""heart of darkness"" is one that most of us resonate with.  But as philosopher Hannah Arendt pointed out in the early 1960s when covering the trial of Nazi Adolf Eichmann, evil can also be ""banal.""  Part of what she meant is the process that occurs when people fail to think or judge rationally, and so just accept as ""normal"" certain kinds of behavior that critical reflection would spot as wicked.  But in using the word ""banal,"" Arendt also wanted to de-melodramatize evil.  Evil actions are more often sordid and grimy, based on ignorance and stereotypes, than diabolically clever.""Blood in the Face"" (which takes its title from the racist myth that only Aryans have moral sensibilities and are capable of blushing) is a perfect example of the banality of evil in both senses.  Filmed at a Michigan gathering of Nazis, KKKers, and Christian Identity loyalists, the film exposes the sheer stupidity, paranoia, and incoherence of the True Believers.Perhaps nowhere is the pathetic nature of it all better captured than in the description of George Lincoln Rockwell's tawdry murder at a laundromat.  But there are lots of other examples:  the long-haired yahoos in faux SS uniforms proudly announcing that they're ready for race war; the nerdy teenager who insists he wouldn't be a racist or a Christian if it weren't for the ""lovable"" teachings of Rockwell; the wedding between two KKK-robed lovers at a cross-burning; an old guy in a bola tie who gets so furious in denouncing Ronald Reagan as a Jew-lover that he looks positively apoplectic; the stern-faced warnings of a coming Armageddon, which will break the US up into racial enclaves; the bizarre Christian Identity claim that Anglo-Saxons are really the chosen people referred to in the Old Testament, and that Jews are imposters; and the dimwitted would-be television host who clumsily interviews fellow-racists and proudly announces that ""we want to create a show that will make white people look intelligent.""  Duh.The ridiculousness of these and other beliefs make for some genuinely hilarious interviews in the film.  But this oughtn't to minimize the fact that neo-Nazis, for all their banality, both advocate and occasionally practice violence.  Viewers are reminded of this at the film's end--just another lesson that evil in the world needn't be plotted by Hollywoodish mastermind villains to be horribly effective.Highly recommended.",5,The banality!

1076355,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B000QJLQEO,stoic,"[1, 4]","I have read quite a bit about political extremists. Therefore, I thought that Blood in the Face would be an interesting look at some of these people ""in the flesh."" The film, however, was a severe disappointment and I recommend that potential viewers avoid it.Blood in the Face focuses on those who were active in the white supremacy movement in the late-1980s. The filmmakers attended a rally in rural Michigan and also conducted a number of interviews with both the movement's leaders and its foot soldiers. The presence of Michael Moore, as an interviewer, will no doubt interest many people.The biggest problem with this film is that the views of the white supremacists simply are not interesting. Most of them cannot articulate why they believe the things that they believe. Most of their views center on the usual targets of the extreme right - international bankers, Jews, the U.S. Government, the media, etc. My wife and I both agreed that we were thoroughly bored after about the first 10-15 minutes of this clunker.The filmmakers miss some opportunities to liven up this dull film. They interview the wife of Bruce Pierce, who was a member of The Order. The Order was the group that murdered Denver talk show host Alan Berg in 1984 and also robbed an armored car in California. Instead of focusing on Pierce and The Order, the filmmakers let her rant incoherently about her uninteresting views on race.Another bizarre sequence is an archival 1960s interview with an inarticulate woman. American Nazi Party leader George Lincoln Rockwell was assassinated in the parking lot outside a laundromat. The woman in the interview happened to be washing her clothes in the laundromat at the time of the assassination. The Rockwell assassination is tangential to the story that the filmmakers tell, but it still could have been interesting. Instead of telling that story, they chose to present the mind-numbing interview.My opinion seems to be in the minority here, but I found Blood in the Face to be a dull way to spend an evening.",2,A Boring Look at Extremists,1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,2033,"['have', 'read', 'quite', 'bit', 'political', 'extremists', 'Therefore', 'thought', 'Blood', 'Face', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'look', 'people', 'flesh', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'severe', 'disappointment', 'recommend', 'potential', 'viewers', 'avoid', 'it.Blood', 'Face', 'focuses', 'who', 'were', 'active', 'white', 'supremacy', 'movement', 'late-1980s', 'filmmakers', 'attended', 'rally', 'rural', 'Michigan', 'also', 'conducted', 'number', 'interviews', 'movement', 'leaders', 'foot', 'soldiers', 'presence', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'interviewer', 'will', 'doubt', 'interest', 'many', 'people.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'views', 'white', 'supremacists', 'simply', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'Most', 'can', 'not', 'articulate', 'why', 'believe', 'things', 'believe', 'Most', 'views', 'center', 'usual', 'targets', 'extreme', 'right', 'international', 'bankers', 'Jews', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'media', 'etc', 'wife', 'agreed', 'were', 'thoroughly', 'bored', 'first', '10-15', 'minutes', 'clunker.The', 'filmmakers', 'miss', 'opportunities', 'liven', 'up', 'dull', 'film', 'interview', 'wife', 'Bruce', 'Pierce', 'who', 'was', 'member', 'Order', 'Order', 'was', 'group', 'murdered', 'Denver', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'Alan', 'Berg', '1984', 'also', 'robbed', 'armored', 'car', 'California', 'Instead', 'focusing', 'Pierce', 'Order', 'filmmakers', 'let', 'rant', 'incoherently', 'uninteresting', 'views', 'race.Another', 'bizarre', 'sequence', 'archival', '1960s', 'interview', 'inarticulate', 'woman', 'American', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'leader', 'George', 'Lincoln', 'Rockwell', 'was', 'assassinated', 'parking', 'lot', 'laundromat', 'woman', 'interview', 'happened', 'be', 'washing', 'clothes', 'laundromat', 'time', 'assassination', 'Rockwell', 'assassination', 'tangential', 'story', 'filmmakers', 'tell', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'Instead', 'telling', 'story', 'chose', 'present', 'mind-numbing', 'interview.My', 'opinion', 'be', 'minority', 'here', 'found', 'Blood', 'Face', 'be', 'dull', 'way', 'spend', 'evening']",N/A
