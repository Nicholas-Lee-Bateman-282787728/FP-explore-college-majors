I hate it when they add asian characters but forget to do the research on their background to make it 'accurate'?  I'm japanese, so it's quite obvious that there was HUGE HUGE errors in Jade's character.  For one thing Khan is a character out of China.  Jade is using Samuri swords from feudal Japan.  Completely opposite sides of the wars and cultures during that time period.  It's like what us Japanese say about the zen gardens and zen furniture.  ""I don't remember ever seen that in Japan.  Oh wait, it's American"".The Jade character being an mercenary is way to cheezy.  The fight between evil and good was ok, but to add a mask of Khan, the chinese Triads, and a samurai warrior from china was way outside of what this could have been.If you ever watch the makings of animated counter-parts from Japan, you'll realize that the first thing they do is make sure that the character designs and parts of the towns, allies are always based on realism.  Ghost in the Shell, they actually flew to Guam (outside Japan) just to practice shooting guns, to see how they work, shoot, see sparks, and do damage.  The realism team brought this back and added it to the film.Spawn 3?  Really really blew the factoid on this one.  Jade is so way off in regards to her culture country background, and the outfit just doesn't look accurate either.  I was really dissapointed by the characters.However I did like the blond mercenary whom was so well animated and would've passed a character from the Street Fighter II animated film.Buy Spawn I, but forget about III.",3,just average,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,1595,"['give', 'one', 'average', 'rating', 'Why', 'hate', 'when', 'add', 'asian', 'characters', 'forget', 'do', 'research', 'background', 'make', ""'accurate"", ""'m"", 'japanese', 'quite', 'obvious', 'was', 'HUGE', 'HUGE', 'errors', 'Jade', 'character', 'one', 'thing', 'Khan', 'character', 'China', 'Jade', 'using', 'Samuri', 'swords', 'feudal', 'Japan', 'Completely', 'opposite', 'sides', 'wars', 'cultures', 'time', 'period', 'what', 'Japanese', 'say', 'zen', 'gardens', 'zen', 'furniture', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ever', 'seen', 'Japan', 'Oh', 'wait', 'American', '.The', 'Jade', 'character', 'being', 'mercenary', 'way', 'cheezy', 'fight', 'evil', 'good', 'was', 'ok', 'add', 'mask', 'Khan', 'chinese', 'Triads', 'samurai', 'warrior', 'china', 'was', 'way', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been.If', 'ever', 'watch', 'makings', 'animated', 'counter-parts', 'Japan', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'first', 'thing', 'do', 'make', 'sure', 'character', 'designs', 'parts', 'towns', 'allies', 'are', 'always', 'based', 'realism', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'actually', 'flew', 'Guam', 'Japan', 'just', 'practice', 'shooting', 'guns', 'see', 'how', 'work', 'shoot', 'see', 'sparks', 'do', 'damage', 'realism', 'team', 'brought', 'back', 'added', 'film.Spawn', '3', 'Really', 'really', 'blew', 'factoid', 'one', 'Jade', 'so', 'way', 'regards', 'culture', 'country', 'background', 'outfit', 'just', ""n't"", 'look', 'accurate', 'was', 'really', 'dissapointed', 'characters.However', 'did', 'blond', 'mercenary', 'whom', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'animated', 'would', ""'ve"", 'passed', 'character', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'II', 'animated', 'film.Buy', 'Spawn', 'forget', 'III']",N/A

It is a very dark and twisted tail of both love, death, mentality and politics. And all of this coming from an animated show is brilliant.The first two seasons basically set up the premise. The first season set the plain and the second season fleshed out all the characters. Now, the third season is where everything starts getting cooler. To start, we have some more words thrown back and fourth between Spawn and the old man who use to be one himself. He has many names, but you can just call him Merlin. Despite the help Merlin offers to the Spawn, Al still refuses to trust Merlin. He lets his anger for not being able to see Wanda consume him, but you already knew that.There are also some new characters introduced. The newest one is a hunter from heaven named Jade, aka Woo the reporter. She is after the Spawn, but soon show an interest in him. Also, many characters get some more character development here. Like the detective, Twitch, comes too close to the truth about Spawn, his own superiors conspire to kill him which makes Twitches partner want to lash out. There are also ""one-shot-characters"" that are quite intersting like Al's mother (granny), Al's old friend and a hooker\vampire.DVD extras here are great. Aside from the featurette and music videos, there is audio commentary by Todd McFarlane. What more could you ask for?Overall, Spawn 3 is the best season of Spawn yet.

This one starts out setting up the ultimate Hell vs. Heaven scenario.  The old man who keeps talking to Spawn whether he likes it or not explains his backround and also explains how this war is being played.  Heaven of course sends the angel bounty hunter to eliminate Spawn and we end up getting a pretty good story here.  But they also send a vampire creature to take Spawn out since the first killer isn't getting the job done.  Not exactly the Heaven I grew up knowing.The show continues to be very violent but not anything too sickening.  I liked how it felt like a good cop drama with the story between Twitch and his mindless partner.

I have just about every issue and ones to date but the movie was good to even thoe it flat out sucked.When I first saw a promo for it on HBO I thought this was gonnablow chuncks.I was wrong.  The series is one of the best! Very Mature!The series does contain Graphic language,Nudity,Graphic Violence(lots of it!  You see chains go through a guys mouth and rip his jaw open.)  The series like I said is the best!1st season(which was very graphic) was like the worm up forseason two(wich was very dark and graphicly violent....dont let the kids see this season.)Season 3 was a bit different from the bullit shot to twitch in the head to seeing sam go insain cause of spawn to terry still being on the run to Spawn confronting his wife as someone els and having sex with her.This season was dark,graphic and grimy...I still enjoyed it but..........there were a few holes they left out like after the very end of season 3 it left alot of people thinking.What exactly happining and when is there going to be a 4th season.  I Hope they come out with a first season than that would leave alota questions behind such as what happend with wanda and what about the whole baby issue.  BRing a season 4!!!!I recently found out there is a dvd series!!!  AWSOME!!All I have of the series are the taped episodes and the entire vhs season videos.  The vhs versian is pretty good(If you got it when it first came out in stores before the whole dvd era camne)But I am gonna probably go to best buy and buy all the seasons there.

We notice a more darker spawn.Well I cant really recommend this to you since I dont have it on dvd but who care I recomend you get on any.I recomend you get it for vhs or dvd. Doesnt matter just as long as youre watching so get either cause there awsome even though dvd has better quality But like I said WHO CARES just as long as youre watching the damn thing!I can Relate this to other great hits such as Aeon Flux series and The Maxx(wich was very confusing and sad for me)So if you want a good dark grimmy cartoon with loads of mature content get the spawn series on dvd or vhs.AND GET THE COMICS!!!!!!THERE NOT DISSAPOINTING",5,Brilliant 3rd season from Mc Farlane,1077580800,"02 24, 2004",2004,2385,"['Spawn', 'shadow', 'doublt', 'one', 'most', 'darkest', 'deepest', 'animated', 'series', 'ever', 'made.It', 'very', 'sad', 'story', 'spawn', 'fans', 'should', 'know.I', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'spawn', 'have', 'just', 'issue', 'ones', 'date', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'even', 'thoe', 'flat', 'sucked.When', 'first', 'saw', 'promo', 'HBO', 'thought', 'was', 'gonnablow', 'chuncks.I', 'was', 'wrong', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'Very', 'Mature', 'series', 'contain', 'Graphic', 'language', 'Nudity', 'Graphic', 'Violence', 'lots', 'see', 'chains', 'go', 'guys', 'mouth', 'rip', 'jaw', 'open', 'series', 'said', 'best', '1st', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'graphic', 'was', 'worm', 'up', 'forseason', 'two', 'was', 'very', 'dark', 'graphicly', 'violent', '.dont', 'let', 'kids', 'see', 'season', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'bit', 'different', 'bullit', 'shot', 'twitch', 'head', 'seeing', 'sam', 'go', 'insain', 'cause', 'spawn', 'terry', 'still', 'being', 'run', 'Spawn', 'confronting', 'wife', 'someone', 'els', 'having', 'sex', 'her.This', 'season', 'was', 'dark', 'graphic', 'grimy', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'few', 'holes', 'left', 'out', 'very', 'end', 'season', '3', 'left', 'alot', 'people', 'exactly', 'happining', 'when', 'there', 'going', 'be', '4th', 'season', 'Hope', 'come', 'out', 'first', 'season', 'would', 'leave', 'alota', 'questions', 'behind', 'such', 'what', 'happend', 'wanda', 'what', 'whole', 'baby', 'issue', 'BRing', 'season', '4', 'recently', 'found', 'dvd', 'series', 'AWSOME', 'have', 'series', 'are', 'taped', 'episodes', 'entire', 'vhs', 'season', 'videos', 'vhs', 'versian', 'pretty', 'good', 'got', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'stores', 'whole', 'dvd', 'era', 'camne', 'am', 'gon', 'na', 'probably', 'go', 'best', 'buy', 'buy', 'seasons', 'there', 'ESSPECIALLY', 'SEASON', '2', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'best', 'series', 'notice', 'more', 'darker', 'spawn.Well', 'cant', 'really', 'recommend', 'dont', 'have', 'dvd', 'who', 'care', 'recomend', 'get', 'any.I', 'recomend', 'get', 'vhs', 'dvd', 'Doesnt', 'matter', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'youre', 'watching', 'so', 'get', 'either', 'cause', 'awsome', 'even', 'dvd', 'better', 'quality', 'said', 'WHO', 'CARES', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'youre', 'watching', 'damn', 'thing', 'can', 'Relate', 'other', 'great', 'hits', 'such', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'series', 'Maxx', 'was', 'very', 'confusing', 'sad', 'So', 'want', 'good', 'dark', 'grimmy', 'cartoon', 'loads', 'mature', 'content', 'get', 'spawn', 'series', 'dvd', 'vhs.AND', 'GET', 'COMICS', 'THERE', 'NOT', 'DISSAPOINTING']",N/A

What makes the whole series so tight is that it gets better and better as it progresses. It is definately one of the most realistic horror,  animated videos I've ever seen. I mean the characters act like real people  and I alsolike the background music because it goes real well with the rest  of the video. I remember a comment that Todd McFarlane made. It was that  he'd rather have no cartoon at all than have one of those  Saturday morning  cartoons which are stereotypically made for children. I understand exactly  howhe felt. I loved the X-Men but I hated when a character like Wolverine  couldn't even use his claws to the fullest effect because it was a  children's show. The only thing I don't really like about &quot;Spawn&quot;  is that they made it as if the war between Heaven and Hell was merely a  myth and to make it worse they made it where God would actually recruit  that fiendish vampire-girl to destroy the Hell-Spawn(Like God's that  desperate).

If I'd been paying more attention I might have found them laughable.If you want to watch an angst-driven animated hero, or anti-hero, with really bad teeth and a cool, life-of-its-own costume, give this one a shot.",2,Spawn,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,944,"['Spawn', 'resurrected', 'U.S.', 'soldier/assassin', 'who', 'made', 'one', 'bad', 'deal', 'Hell', 'tries', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'something', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'idea', 'immerse', 'Spawn', 'SPAWN', '3', 'compilation', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'HBO', 'animated', 'series.However', 'seeing', 'SPAWN', '3', ""'m"", 'not', 'anxious', 'investigate', '1', '2', 'animation', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'gosh', 'one', 'slow', 'moving', 'action', 'story', 'Even', 'neophyte', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'most', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'movie', 'repeat', 'things', 'realize', 'supposed', 'be', 'mature', 'comic', 'aimed', 'adult', 'audience', 'found', 'philosophical', 'musings', 'shallow', 'trite', ""'d"", 'been', 'paying', 'more', 'attention', 'might', 'have', 'found', 'laughable.If', 'want', 'watch', 'angst-driven', 'animated', 'hero', 'anti-hero', 'really', 'bad', 'teeth', 'cool', 'life-of-its-own', 'costume', 'give', 'one', 'shot']",N/A

And even if you didn't like those 2 you still might like this one very much. The other two  seem to drag on, and on, and on. But they're still very entertaining if you  watch it in segments. However this one has a LOT more action. My favorite  part is when Spawn fights the vampire girl. Thats the closest thing in  america to anime. I think the next season, hopefully another will be made,  should have a lot more of that fighting in it.
