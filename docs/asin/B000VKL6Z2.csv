I thought young Michael was played by a really ugly, young Jodie Foster looking kid. Was that a boy? I'm still not sure. Zombie puts the great Halloween classic movie through a white trash, trailer park dumpster. And why did every reject in this movie have long hair? Was that a requirement to get the role? Even Dr. Loomis had it early on. What a joke. Can you imagine Donald Pleasance looking like a filthy hippie? Very stupid. The only good thing about this unrated film is all the hot chicks. [...] Still, this was a horrible movie. Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween IV, V and even VI (Pleasance last) are classics in my book. All the others made are pure garbage.

1102388,A1YSDK1ZEVMT7U,B000VKL6Z2,Aaron M.,"[4, 4]","Rob Zombie immediately sets about committing the worst mistake you can with a horror villain: He shows us way too much.First we get a painfully long look at Myers childhood. His white trash parents, abusive step-father, bullies at school, etc. Myers snaps and kills a bully. Then on Halloween night he kills his step father, after strapping him down to a chair with duct tape. It beggars belief not just on a practical level, but the child playing Myers just does not seem all that disturbed. We are supposed to assume he is based on his actions, but it's not present in the performance. At all.Then Myers is shipped off to the Mental Hospital where he meets Dr Loomis and then grows up. We are treated to many scenes letting us know what a bad ass Myers is now. Eventually Myers escapes and then a much less effective rehash of the original film is played out. None of it is the least bit scary.That's the main problem here. It's obvious that Mr. Zombie sympathizes with the Myers character above all else. He has little love for Loomis or anyone else in this film (except Myers mother...paging Dr Freud...)This is a love letter to fan boys of, not Halloween, but the Myers character. It's apparently societies fault that Myers goes berserk, and his victims are not so much victims, but deserving targets of Myers rage. It's something a disaffected 14 year old might come up with. The sort of sheltered poser that got all their ideas about what is ""gritty and real"" from, well, bad Halloween sequels.I suppose none of this is too surprising, considering the cult following Myers has built up over the course of several sequels. It would have been nice to see the series dragged back to its original premise though, where Myers was not a hero and we were supposed to care about his victims.Gone is most of the supernatural element of the original. We are firmly in fully human psycho territory here. How boring. Especially since Zombie has nothing to add, he just regurgitates all the well worn clich&eacute;s.

1102389,A2RO5BKNBR7BSR,B000VKL6Z2,"A. BOSTON ""***""","[4, 7]",I am watching this film for the first time as I write this. It should be noted that I still think of the original Halloween as the best slasher film ever made. It should also be noted that I have never really liked Rob Zombie's films. I respect his art style and direction but to me his films arent that great or original what so ever. They are just Chainsaw rip-offs.Im only 20 minutes in and I have to wonder why mess with the story so much? The original Carpenter masterpiece was flawless. So why change EVERYTHING??? When Michael killed his family in the original it was in 1963. Now Zombie has Michael running around with a KISS T shirt and listening to KISS. I love KISS dont get me wrong. But the band formed in the early 70's. Why change that? And why change the dynamic of Michaels parents? In the original you only see them in the scene after he killed his sister. His parents were clean cut people. Why take the father out of the picture all together and replace him with a drunken step-dad? Why turn mom into a stripper? To show how Mike got so screwed up? Thats all fine and dandy but even clean cut families have dysfunction. Why did Zombie have to change basically the WHOLE MOVIE??? Why even re-make Halloween at all???Please listen to me. If you love the original you owe it to yourself NOT to watch this film. It takes what was great about the original and flushes it right down the toilet.,2,Why mess with perfection?,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,1408,"['am', 'watching', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'write', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'still', 'think', 'original', 'Halloween', 'best', 'slasher', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'films', 'respect', 'art', 'style', 'direction', 'films', 'arent', 'great', 'original', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'are', 'just', 'Chainsaw', 'rip-offs.Im', 'only', '20', 'minutes', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'mess', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'original', 'Carpenter', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'flawless', 'So', 'why', 'change', 'EVERYTHING', 'When', 'Michael', 'killed', 'family', 'original', 'was', '1963', 'Now', 'Zombie', 'Michael', 'running', 'around', 'KISS', 'T', 'shirt', 'listening', 'KISS', 'love', 'KISS', 'dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'band', 'formed', 'early', '70', 'Why', 'change', 'why', 'change', 'dynamic', 'Michaels', 'parents', 'original', 'only', 'see', 'scene', 'killed', 'sister', 'parents', 'were', 'clean', 'cut', 'people', 'Why', 'take', 'father', 'picture', 'together', 'replace', 'drunken', 'step-dad', 'Why', 'turn', 'mom', 'stripper', 'show', 'how', 'Mike', 'got', 'so', 'screwed', 'up', 'Thats', 'fine', 'dandy', 'even', 'clean', 'cut', 'families', 'have', 'dysfunction', 'Why', 'did', 'Zombie', 'have', 'change', 'basically', 'WHOLE', 'MOVIE', 'Why', 'even', 're-make', 'Halloween', 'Please', 'love', 'original', 'owe', 'NOT', 'watch', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'great', 'original', 'flushes', 'right', 'down', 'toilet']",Halloween

1102394,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000VKL6Z2,A. Estes,"[0, 1]","When it was announced last year that rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie would be helming a remake of John Carpenter's ""Halloween,"" it was met with mixed reactions. Some balked at the idea of remaking such a vital and iconic movie, while others were anxious to see what such a unique character as Rob could do with the material. Count me in the latter. It helps being a fan of his music from the beginning, but also take into consideration how poor the past few ""Halloween"" movies have been. If anyone were to remake it, could it turn out any better than Rob Zombie's? Even after watching it twice, and both times being frustrated with it's lack of focus, I still say the answer to that question is most certainly ""no.""We all know the story of the Boogeyman, The Shape, or quite simply, Michael Myers. So to do a shot-for-shot remake (ala ""Psycho"") or anything of the like would be silly. Which is exactly where the trouble with this movie lies. ""Halloween 2007,"" as I will refer to it from here-on-out, plays like two very different movies fused together. First, we have Rob's vision. A Michael Myers with a story. He might not be given much motivation, but what Rob gives us in the first half is not only intriguing and disturbing, but actually refreshing when compared to the sequels. This is where he truly makes his mark and reinvents Michael Myers as we know him. About 45 minutes into the movie, however, it takes a turn. From out of nowhere, Rob starts rushing into a lazy remake of the original movie's events. We are introduced to Laurie Strode, this time played by fresh-faced Scout Taylor-Compton, along with Annie (played by Danielle Harris, making a bold return to the series) and Linda (Kristina Klebe). The three girls spout off lines from the original in such an off-handed way that you feel like you're watching an amateur film-maker fresh out of his first high school film-making class. To say the dialogue is terrible would be an understatement: it cripples the second half of the second movie completely! Virtually nothing in the second half of the film is effective. The kids are routinely dispatched in such a careless way. Some characters die after only being in the movie for a matter of moments. There is no character development for the second half, so it's hard to feel any tension. It was nice to see Rob recreate some memorable moments in his own way, and Danielle Harris has some truly unforgettable moments with Michael, but other than that, it's a dud, and as someone who awaited this movie with baited breath (a big ""Halloween"" nut and Rob Zombie fan, mind you), I found myself yawning from time to time in the last half. And let's not even get into it's dud of an ending. Had Rob Zombie stuck with what he had established in the first half and forgotten about paying tribute to the original movie (or whatever he was trying to do) in the second half, the results could have been much, much better.On a more positive note, it sports an impressive cast. Not only is it satisfying to see Danielle Harris once again facing Michael Myers, but Malcolm McDowell (""A Clockwork Orange"") is about the best they could have done to replace Donald Pleasence and Sam Loomis. Brad ""Chucky"" Dourif, as Sheriff Brackett, is spot on, but unfortunately gets very little time. Just about everyone involved in ""The Devil's Rejects"" gets a part, from Bill Moseley, William Forsythe, Ken Foree, Sid Haig and Sheri Moon Zombie, who takes advantage of her role as Michael's mom and surprisingly goes against the stereotype she has been built up to. Danny Trejo, however, was the biggest surprise, and his parts with Michael are those that work best. His fate serves as the best example of Michael's lack of reason or mercy, and truly makes him a horror villian to be reckoned with and may be enough to send chills down the spines of even the biggest horror fans. Daeg Faerch, who plays a young Michael Myers, is also a nice surprise, as kids in horror movies can tend to be annoying. Yet, he turns in a very creepy and very believeable performance of a very disturbed young boy.The movie, on the whole, looks gorgeous. Rob obviously knows his stuff, but the major problem is in the script. At times, the movie feels incomplete, and at others, it feels like he is making it up as he goes along. It goes without saying that the original didn't need to be remade, as it is still effective to this day, so if a ""re-telling"" was neccessary, why didn't Rob make it his own? Like ""Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers,"" you can literally smell the studio interference here. The movie not only makes little sense, but feels incomplete and rushed. What starts off as an intriguing and refreshing take on a well-known character, eventually degrades itself into boring drivel. It's painful to say it, but Rob's vision of ""Halloween"" hardly pans out any better than the dismal ""H20"" or ""Resurrection."" Even those watching who don't know the original should sense that something is wrong here. It's like Rob Zombie either didn't have the confidence to make this his own, or didn't really want to make the film in the first place.",3,Happy Halloween?,1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,5125,"['When',

The main problem I have with the story is how much time is devoted to Michael Myers' troubled childhood.  So, little Mikey is picked on at school, he kills animals, and his homelife truly sucks.  So...are we supposed to feel sympathy when he becomes a raging psychopath?  I certainly didn't.And, since this is a Rob Zombie film, you have to include virtually non-stop profanity, sickening violence and thoroughly loathesome characters.  Others have menioned that Myers' mother was the lone sympathetic character in the film.  And she's a stripper.  Not much sympathy there, either.Look, I LIKE horror movies.  And I like the original Halloween and maybe about half of the sequels.  But this thing is just pitiful.  There's no suspense, no levity at all, just 2 hours of in-your-face filth and violence.

When I heard Zombie was going to do a remake of this classic, at first I was appalled, but then I saw the Devil's Rejects and my apprehensions were quickly allayed. Then the trailer came out in the spring, after seeing that... Halloween(2007) quickly became my most anticipated movie of the year over everything else.Aug 31st rolls around, I catch the midnight show, the theatre is packed and pumped for a good scarin'... ten minutes roll by and my head is ringing with the words 'oh no, this can't be happening.' The first hour rolls by and I'm slumping in my seat, thinking there might be some hope. The 90 minute mark rolls by and my hand is covering my mouth, not by the terror of what's unfolding on screen, but by the stark realization that I'm probably watching the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The credits pop up and my jaw just hits the floor at the stench of awfulness this movie exudes.Piss poor direction. Piss poor acting from everyone(I'm talking to you Malcolm McDowell) involved. Piss poor writing. Piss poor cinematography. Not only is this movie poorly made, but it's just not scary... AT ALL!!!!!What makes this movie tragic is the fact that Rob Zombie is a 42 year old horror junkie who has been around the block. In his interviews he seems like a guy who knows what he's talking about. You would think his life experience would translate into a piece of work that was unique. Not so.And for those who support this flick then I have to come to the conclusion that 1) You don't know anything about Horror movies. 2)You really don't know anything about Horror movies. 3) You TRULY don't know anything about Horror movies.Rob Zombie, in my mind, has made the first Horror movie for the mentally challenged. It's akin to watching a fecal clogged toilet bowl in a grimy public restroom. This movie could actually be a litmus test for judging one's character.Yet I encourage everyone to see it if they're interested in filmmaking as a cautionary tale of what not to do when crafting a story.

In the original Halloween we never really knew why Michael was bad, in this remake, the first thirty minutes or so expore the childhood of Michael Myers.  People say that the dialog concerning Michael's family was wrong.  Trust me, I have seen broken homes and Mr. Zombie gives us exactly what you would expect from a trashy family.Besides satisfying my curiosity of Michael's childhood, I found this to be similar in many cases to the original, but at the same time the material was quite fresh with new chills and scares.

I like his music and was overwhelmed with joy after House of 1000 Corpses, just because it was a REAL horror film, when all we had were ignorant 'horror' films that just tried to trash horror altogether. When I first heard that Rob was going to do a Halloween movie, I jumped for joy. I heard he was supposed to be such a huge fan of the movie and I thought if anyone could bring it back to the brilliance of John Carpenter, Rob could do it.I WAS WRONG.I think Rob must've sat and watched John's movie and said, 'Everything he DID do, I WON'T do. Everything he DIDN'T do, I WILL do.'Not much blood, mine will be a bloodbath.Not a lot of nudity, mine will have wall-to-wall t&a.;People who never got the idea that Michael Myers was supposed to be the boogeyman and he's supposed to be a supernatural entity in the shape of a human will be happy, because Rob makes Michael a 'regular' guy, making the Loomis dialogue about him being evil sound really pretentious. Also, it's funny that you can keep shooting him and stuff and he still keeps coming, despite the fact he's a 'regular' guy. You can even blast his blood and brains all over the place and he'll just wind up with a little scrape on his head.Sorry Rob. Have to call B.S. on that.I'm really trying to say that Rob Zombie just WAY OVERTHOUGHT this movie. One of the things that made the original so great was the fact the story was so simple, if you just pay attention while watching it.I DO like the cast a bit. Danielle Harris and Kristine Bleebe are lovely, awesome and look really good with no clothes on. Malcolm McDowell was a super choice for Loomis. Brad Dourif is always a joy to see in any movie. We get the Zombie regulars (i.e. Sherry Moon, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, Ken Foree, etc.) That warmed my heart to see that.I am waiting with anticipation to see Lords of Salem, his next movie, but Rob should stop with remakes and make his own, original movies.

Great portrayal of Michael Meyers; this film fully explores his genesis, and it is very brutal and gripping.  Malcom McDowell is interesting as the psychiatrist.*Excellent sound and music design.*Lots of bloody killings.  Horror fans should be satisfied.The Bad Things*Many of the girls in the film scream incessantly and act stupidly.  Sometimes, you want to yell at the screen ""What are you doing? Run!!"" Could also be a good thing, because it's suspenseful.*None of the victims show as much strength as Jamie Lee Curis did in the original version.  The one surviving character shows this only in the very very last second.*There is stronger brutality, more swearing, more sex, and more blood.  Fans of the older, classier version may not like this.I really hated the original ""Holloween,"" so I believe this is a superior version.  Its style is not only modernized, but also downright scary and unsettling.  I am particuarly impressed by its portrayal of Michael Meyers; there is much more character depth to him, and they go into his back story much more deeply.

With that being said Halloween is a worthy ""re-imaging"" of the original. honestly didnt you feel a lil cheated finding out that Michael and his family was part of cult (and we didnt find that out until like halloween 37 (lol).

First try to copy and imitate the Texas Chainsaw Massacre with one movie... now do a remake of a classic and fail miserably.What exactly does this have to do with the original?... This is Rob Zombie's warped version of a classic.We have some twisted version of the 1970's with a family of Rednecks. Michael Myers is their child.  You can see the kids face- There is no mystery in this at all-  Then we have the same plot as the original with different things added. Then the story switches over to present day and the same old story except 10 times worse.  Here we have Malcolm McDowell as Doctor Loomis and the lady from E.T.... Even these good actors couldnt save this mess of a movie.The horror genre really needs to think up something new instead of recyling the same old movies and failing at it. You have the greats and then you have the copiers and imitators who end up trying to copy legends and failing everytime. This is another example of that.

I DID like this movie...it offers a lot on it's own merit.  I think Rob Zombie's re-writing and direction was very well done, the performances were phenomenal, and overall the flick is a very effective study of psychosis and the tragedy of poverty, apathy, and mental illness in our society.But to have the title of ""Halloween""...This ""re-imagining"" was obviously done with a love of the original, and again I hasten to say I didn't DISlike it, but it just does not come close to the magic found in Carpenter's masterpiece.  Too many other reviewers here have pointed out what is MY primary issue with it...the humanization of Michael Myers robs him of the menacing fear that he carried in the original film.That fear is inevitably replaced with a kind of grudging sympathy.  Regardless of his brutality or the fact that he's now about nine feet tall and weighs about a thousand pounds, we can't help but feel sorry for the poor child we get to know and share heartache with in the first half-hour or so of the film.  Those of us who have seen it, admit it; are there any of us out here that didn't think his first two killings were justified?  Did we not, albeit in a fantastic sense of horror-film viewing, feel that those first two victims got what they deserved?After that, it was easy to swallow his fall into psychosis and at least partially not hold him to blame for what he did.The cinematography and acting is superb; Scout Taylor-Compton is excellent in her starring role, Malcolm McDowall was an inspired choice to take up the mantle of Dr. Loomis, and Tyler Mane is an intimidating screen presence, with or without the signature Mask.  Add in Danny Trejo in a wonderfully sympathetic performance (which only adds to the sadness we ultimately feel for Michael, although it seems to try to make us hate him), William Forsythe in a grimy and easily hated part, and the wonderful Dee Wallace in a small but convincing role, and you have all that is needed for a great horror film......and we get a very good one, but not if you were like I was, and hoping (perhaps naively so) for the same level of horror and fear we got in 1978.Well worth the watch; you won't feel you've wasted your time on it, but don't be expecting the hair on the back of your neck to be doing the two-step as you sit in dread for the grim, masked spectre of Myers...instead, expect to feel disgusted with the illustrated failings of family, society, and the mental-health system.A good movie on all counts...but, at least to THIS horror aficianado, just not ""Halloween"".",4,"""He really was the Boogeyman, wasn't he?""...""No, THIS time he's a sad little boy twisted by his upbringing...""",1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,2613,"['Right', 'gate', 'rating', 'three-and-a-half', 'stars', 'DID', 'movie', 'lot', 'own', 'merit', 'think', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 're-writing', 'direction', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'performances', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'flick', 'very', 'effective', 'study', 'psychosis', 'tragedy', 'poverty', 'apathy', 'mental', 'illness', 'society.But', 'have', 'title', 'Halloween', 're-imagining', 'was', 'obviously', 'done', 'love', 'original', 'again', 'hasten', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'DISlike', 'just', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'magic', 'found', 'Carpenter', 'masterpiece', 'Too', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'what', 'MY', 'primary', 'issue', 'humanization', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'robs', 'menacing', 'fear', 'carried', 'original', 'film.That', 'fear', 'inevitably', 'replaced', 'kind', 'grudging', 'sympathy', 'Regardless', 'brutality', 'fact', 'now', 'about', 'nine', 'feet', 'tall', 'thousand', 'pounds', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'poor', 'child', 'get', 'know', 'share', 'heartache', 'first', 'half-hour', 'so', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'first', 'two', 'killings', 'were', 'justified', 'Did', 'not', 'fantastic', 'sense', 'horror-film', 'viewing', 'feel', 'first', 'two', 'victims', 'got', 'what', 'deserved', 'was', 'easy', 'swallow', 'fall', 'psychosis', 'least', 'partially', 'not', 'hold', 'blame', 'what', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'superb', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'excellent', 'starring', 'role', 'Malcolm', 'McDowall', 'was', 'inspired', 'choice', 'take', 'up', 'mantle', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'intimidating', 'screen', 'presence', 'signature', 'Mask', 'Add', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'wonderfully', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'only', 'sadness', 'ultimately', 'feel', 'Michael', 'try', 'make', 'hate', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'grimy', 'easily', 'hated', 'part', 'wonderful', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'small', 'convincing', 'role', 'have', 'needed', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'get', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'not', 'were', 'was', 'hoping', 'perhaps', 'naively', 'so', 'same', 'level', 'horror', 'fear', 'got', '1978.Well', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'wasted', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'expecting', 'hair', 'back', 'neck', 'be', 'doing', 'two-step', 'sit', 'dread', 'grim', 'masked', 'spectre', 'Myers', 'instead', 'expect', 'feel', 'disgusted', 'illustrated', 'failings', 'family', 'society', 'mental-health', 'system.A', 'good', 'movie', 'counts', 'least', 'THIS', 'horror', 'aficianado', 'just', 'not', 'Halloween']",Halloween
1102409,A3HDS90T9G930O,B000VKL6Z2,AnimeGod981,"[1, 3]",The 1st thing I noticed about this movie was it was from the point of view of the hunter instead of the hunted. For the 1st time wee see what Michael sees not what his victims see. This version does an extensive build up of the Michale Myres character from his child hood of abuse- how his step dad mentally and physically abuses him and how his sister ignores him. We learn how he was picked on at school to the point this small 10 yr old snaps. We also get to learn about his obsession with masks and how he dealt with being in the mental institution as well as how he escaped and the storyline of how he became the monster he was in the previous movies. The 1st part of the movie gets the viewer to see exactly what happened to this small child to push the right buttons to create the perfect killing machine..The cinematography was great from the film color dating the movie back 20 yrs. With some modern changes to how high school kids act now a days to add to the realism. The blood wasn't over done or digitalized. Zombie kept a sense of realism that made the movie that much more believable raising the scare factor.Of course if you follow zombies previous films you will see a hand full of actors and actresses make an appearance from time to time. The children actors did an amazing job as well. The other thing I liked was I never got bored. I remember the old slasher flicks like the Freddy and the Jason films as well as the old Halloween movies- during scenes of character development there was a lot of boring dialog that slowed the movies down to a crawl and lost my interest until another sex scene or another killing depending on the film I was watching. This movie manager to negate all that boring sluggishness development and still create a character on the screen.,5,A new point of view on an old classic,1223424000,"10 8, 2008",2008,1786,"['1st', 'thing', 'noticed', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'point', 'view', 'hunter', 'instead', 'hunted', '1st', 'time', 'wee', 'see', 'what', 'Michael', 'not', 'what', 'victims', 'see', 'version', 'extensive', 'build', 'Michale', 'Myres', 'character', 'child', 'hood', 'abuse-', 'how', 'step', 'mentally', 'physically', 'how', 'sister', 'learn', 'how', 'was', 'picked', 'school', 'point', 'small', '10', 'yr', 'old', 'snaps', 'also', 'get', 'learn', 'obsession', 'masks', 'how', 'being', 'mental', 'institution', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'escaped', 'storyline', 'how', 'became', 'monster', 'was', 'previous', 'movies', '1st', 'part', 'movie', 'viewer', 'see', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'small', 'child', 'push', 'right', 'buttons', 'create', 'perfect', 'killing', 'machine..The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'color', 'dating', 'movie', 'back', '20', 'yrs', 'modern', 'changes', 'how', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'act', 'now', 'days', 'add', 'realism', 'blood', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'digitalized', 'Zombie', 'kept', 'sense', 'realism', 'made', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'raising', 'scare', 'factor.Of', 'course', 'follow', 'zombies', 'previous', 'films', 'will', 'see', 'hand', 'full', 'actors', 'actresses', 'make', 'appearance', 'time', 'time', 'children', 'actors', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'thing', 'liked', 'was', 'never', 'got', 'bored', 'remember', 'old', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'Freddy', 'Jason', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'old', 'Halloween', 'movies-', 'scenes', 'character', 'development', 'there', 'was', 'lot', 'boring', 'dialog', 'slowed', 'movies', 'down', 'crawl', 'lost', 'interest', 'sex', 'scene', 'killing', 'depending', 'film', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'manager', 'negate', 'boring', 'sluggishness', 'development', 'still', 'create', 'character', 'screen']",Halloween

1102411,A2RUUTTFJQ7CBH,B000VKL6Z2,Anton Tobias,"[111, 155]","We arrived at the theater early to get good seats.  Rob Zombie's new rendition of the classic ""Halloween"" had been hyped for weeks on the Internet, television, and in magazines so it was all we could think about.  My wife and I (being devoted fans of the 1978 classic) wanted to be first in line to see just how close the publicity was to the actual delivery.  Is ""re-imaging"" the perfect modern horror film a good idea?  We had mixed feelings on that but nonetheless remained unbiased and anxious to see what Rob Zombie had in store for us.  Sure, his past films didn't exactly amount to anything worthwhile but maybe he worked that out of his system, and this was Halloween.  He at least had a good storyline to draw from.  We sat discussing the many avenues the film could take, watching the small group of other moviegoers take their seat for the matinee showing.  The glow from the projection booth kicked on, the crowd fell silent,  the lights dimmed.Expecting something intriguing for the opening credits and remembering how stylistic John Carpenter had been with his slow tracking shot of the flickering jack-o`-lantern with credits rolling to the right, I couldn't wait to see how this new remake started.  Excitement quickly gave way to disappointment.  The film simply kicks off with a simple shot of the Myers house being thrown in the audience face complete with the onset of Rob Zombie's blaring, classic rock soundtrack.  I couldn't help but sigh out loud with a sense of  pessimistic foreshadowing ...would this opening scene set the pace for the rest of the film?  I sincerely hoped not.Next, and in typical Rob Zombie fashion, we are introduced to the loud, obnoxious, vulgar, screaming, white-trash characters in the film.  It was about this point I abandoned all hope of this even coming close to the original and realized this was going to be just another typical Rob Zombie shoutfest, complete with excessive gore, shock value gimmicks, unsteady camera movements, endless close-ups and stereotypical characters including another shameless plug for his wife.  The only difference is this time he had the Halloween name to deceive and lure an audience with.Lacking any subtle sickness of the original film the movie chugs along as scattered as a shotgun blast.  Rob Zombie attempts to add some backstory to the Michael Myers character but in doing so eliminates any mystery surrounding his presence,  making him just another knife-wielding killer who pops up to slash and kill...slash and kill...slash and kill...Even the veteran actor  Malcolm McDowell, in his role of Dr. Loomis, can't save this run-of-the-mill Zombie zero.  The character who was so powerfully played by Donald Pleasance in 1978 is now lacking in recklessness determination and intensity.  He is reduced to a soft spoken, school psychiatrist who actually befriends Michael as a child and then just gets lost in the mix as another faceless character/victim.Although this movie doesn't follow the same predictable suit as its countless sequels, it seems  Mr. Zombie is almost incapable of creating suspense.  Genuinely frightening moments are substituted for unnecessary (and comedic) amounts of carnage, blood, and gore.  The movie feels rushed, paying no attention to mood or atmosphere.  The camera continues to erratically bounce around as Michael Myers keeps popping up so fast I lost track of certain scene settings.  Asking myself, ""Wait...what house are we in now...wasn't he just down the street two seconds ago?""  Characters continue to talk but speak their lines on top of each other and with such speed I actually started laughing at one point.As the film concluded and the credits began to roll people began to exit the theatre.  I couldn't help but notice the looks of disappointment on  the audience faces as they were leaving.In a nation of full of trendy PG-13 rated horror films I can respect what Rob Zombie is doing to make a no-I-won't-tone-it-down statement but his in-your-face style of directing doesn't (to say the least) transfer over to this genre very well.  It seems he is just more interested in getting a reaction out of people then creating a good film, which is very sad considering the potential this project had.Bottom line:  If you are a fan of the original ""Halloween"" you will be insulted by this remake.  Rob Zombie's self-important vision of a classic might play well with today's younger and more gullible teenage audience but for longtime Halloween addicts (and everyone else for that matter) this film is sure to disappoint.",1,LACKING IN EVERY RESPECT...,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,4555,"['arrived', 'theater', 'early', 'get', 'good', 'seats', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'new', 'rendition', 'classic',

It took me about three minutes until I changed my mind. Rob Zombie set the story straight and I like how he was very honest about this movie. Its a very good movie if your not looking for a complete scene to scene remake of the original. Thanks to Rob Zombie for that comment. I still hate things about the movie but i'd give it four stars anyways. Its Zombie's idea and vision and I respect that. His commentary on the dvd is very well done.

What I ended up with instead is a major disappointment. The original scene in which Michael escapes (one of the best scenes of the theatrical version) is now preceded by a horrific and very graphic rape scene, and the escape itself has been changed. What was a very dramatic, violent and destructive event is much less so, having been watered down to be almost PG-13 worthy.Where was Udo Kier? I remember seeing him in the theatrical version but unless I blinked and missed him he was completely absent from the Director's Cut. There are several missing pieces, including some of the footage from the scene toward the end of the film in which Michael chases Boo (Laurie) through the house.The special features (deleted scenes, etc.) are really good - I wonder why they weren't added to the Director's Cut when some of them were already present in the original version of the film?The performances were all strong, the directing was excellent, and it was interesting to see the alternate ending and other features, but overall the film has lost it's initial impact due to too much tinkering.Potential buyers would be better off buying the other two-disc set (the theatrical version) than this cut.",2,Extremely disappointing...,1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,1344,"['When', 'bought', 'Director', 'Cut', 'expected', 'basically', 'get', 'same', 'amazing', 'film', 'saw', 'theater', 'added', 'action', 'more', 'backstory', 'What', 'ended', 'up', 'instead', 'major', 'disappointment', 'original', 'scene', 'Michael', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'theatrical', 'version', 'now', 'preceded', 'horrific', 'very', 'graphic', 'rape', 'scene', 'escape', 'been', 'changed', 'What', 'was', 'very', 'dramatic', 'violent', 'destructive', 'event', 'much', 'less', 'so', 'having', 'been', 'watered', 'down', 'be', 'almost', 'PG-13', 'worthy.Where', 'was', 'Udo', 'Kier', 'remember', 'seeing', 'theatrical', 'version', 'blinked', 'missed', 'was', 'completely', 'absent', 'Director', 'Cut', 'are', 'several', 'missing', 'pieces', 'including', 'footage', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'Michael', 'Boo', 'Laurie', 'house.The', 'special', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'etc', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', ""n't"", 'added', 'Director', 'Cut', 'when', 'were', 'already', 'present', 'original', 'version', 'film', 'performances', 'were', 'strong', 'directing', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'alternate', 'ending', 'other', 'features', 'film', 'lost', 'initial', 'impact', 'due', 'too', 'much', 'tinkering.Potential', 'buyers', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'buying', 'other', 'two-disc', 'set', 'theatrical', 'version', 'cut']",Halloween
1102415,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000VKL6Z2,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[3, 3]","Rob, you've had me frustrated with this film from the very beginning. The fact it was being made, that you were doing it, and then the horrendous reviews that were coming in from critics and ""online"" people. I went into the movie expecting the worst after reading these so called ""reviews"", and I came out very happy. No movie in recent memory has had me frustrated, nor have I been so led astray from online communities I usually believe. Rob Zombie's interpretation of the 1978 John Carpenter original is by no means a masterpiece. It is flawed, it has cliches, it has holes big enough to drive a semi thru, and parts that expect you to defy all logic. That being said, it was an interesting ride. You all know the story, so no need to get into that. The second the movie starts, it's a bit jarring. It is definitley a Rob Zombie movie, but definitley not a Halloween movie. Things get better once little Michael starts to snap. I was not a fan of the redneck, hillbilly, white trash section of this film, but it gets good when Michael finally flips. Plus, Sheri Moon Zombie is surprisingy emotional and touching in places. William Forsythe?. Well, he's William Forsythe. The second section, at Smith's Grove, is quite interesting. Michael's break out is a little too easy, but riveting nonetheless. The third section, where things really take us to ""Halloween"" land, is not a ""shot by shot remake"" that others would lead you to believe. There are some dialogue lifted from the original, and some classic scenes are recreated. However, most of these recreated scenes have a different touch to them, and this half also has new scenes, outcomes, directions, and so on, that cancel out ALL claims that it is a shot by shot remake. Zombie always keeps things interesting and interesting looking, if not some of the characters. He has littered the movie from start to finish with numerous decorations, pumpkins, and trick or treaters, to make this movie feel more like Halloween than even the original, and a number of the sequels. The three teenage girls are a problem. The Laurie character is no Jamie Lee, but she doesn't quite get as short changed as the other two, especially the Linda character. This part of the film felt a bit rushed and poorly thought out. At least Danielle Harris is still beautiful!. Malcolm McDowell is a welcomed Loomis. Once you see him and hear his voice, you realize that there is no other person but him who could of been Loomis. As for Tyler Mane, I was ready to hate his Michael, but I didn't. I still think he's too big, but he was effective and creepy in places. Brad Dourif was a fun choice for Sheriff Brackett, but like other B movie veterans, he is underused and discarded not long after he's introduced. The violence makes Carpenter's original look PG rated. Brutal violence like this has it's place, but I don't care for it in a Halloween movie. That being said, it didn't take me out of the picture as stated by other critics. However, I did feel a scene here and there were quite pointless and were just there to be extreme and hardcore, as if Rob couldn't dream up some scares so he wanted to just jolt people again. The score is teriffic. Bits of Carpetner's original are here and there, as well as Tyler Bates' own. Folks, this isn't the hatchet job a lot of Zombie haters and Halloween purists(of which I am one)are ballyhooing about. It's a very strong and interesting film that had me hooked from start to finish. There is no denying that nothing will ever top or match Carpenter's scary classic, but this was probably the best Halloween since the original, and the first to really give out that classic Halloween vibe, especially in the third act. I never thought I would find myself defending a Rob Zombie movie, since I was not a fan of his other films, but here I am. It's wicked, it's nasty, it's atmospheric, it's creepy, and it's just a wild ride. The first horror movie in a long time to really grab me and make me think about it afterward. Rob, I was all set to write some witty attacks on your film, but I won't get to use them. Instead, I say thanks, thanks for making a Halloween film that really hits you for the first time in nearly 30 years.",4,"Blast You, Rob Zombie!",1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,4205,"['Rob', ""'ve"", 'had', 'frustrated', 'film', 'very', 'beginning', 'fact', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'were', 'doing', 'then', 'horrendous', 'reviews', 'were', 'coming', 'critics', 'online', 'people', 'went', 'movie', 'expecting', 'worst', 'reading', 'so', 'called', 'reviews', 'came', 'out', 'very', 'happy', 'movie', 'recent', 'memory', 'had', 'frustrated', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'led', 'astray', 'online', 'communities', 'usually', 'believe', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'interpretation', '1978', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'masterpiece', 'flawed', 'cliches', 'holes', 'big', 'enough', 'drive', 'semi', 'thru', 'parts', 'expect', 'defy', 'logic', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'interesting', 'ride', 'know', 'story', 'need', 'get', 'second', 'movie', 'bit', 'jarring', 'definitley', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'movie', 'not', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'Things', 'get', 'better', 'once', 'little', 'Michael', 'snap', 'was', 'not', 'fan', 'redneck', 'hillbilly', 'white', 'trash', 'section', 'film', 'good', 'when', 'Michael', 'finally', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'surprisingy', 'emotional', 'touching', 'places', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'Well', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'second', 'section', 'Smith', 'Grove', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Michael', 'break', 'out', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'riveting', 'nonetheless', 'third', 'section', 'where', 'things', 'really', 'take', 'Halloween', 'land', 'not', 'shot', 'shot', 'remake', 'others', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'are', 'dialogue', 'lifted', 'original', 'classic', 'scenes', 'are', 'recreated', 'However', 'most', 'recreated', 'scenes', 'have', 'different', 'touch', 'half', 'also', 'new', 'scenes', 'outcomes', 'directions', 'so', 'out', 'ALL', 'shot', 'shot', 'remake', 'Zombie', 'always', 'things', 'interesting', 'interesting', 'looking', 'not', 'characters', 'littered', 'movie', 'start', 'finish', 'numerous', 'decorations', 'pumpkins', 'trick', 'treaters', 'make', 'movie', 'feel', 'more', 'Halloween', 'even', 'original', 'number', 'sequels', 'three', 'teenage', 'girls', 'are', 'problem', 'Laurie', 'character', 'Jamie', 'Lee', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'short', 'changed', 'other', 'two', 'especially', 'Linda', 'character', 'part', 'film', 'felt', 'bit', 'rushed', 'poorly', 'thought', 'out', 'least', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'still', 'beautiful', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'welcomed', 'Loomis', 'Once', 'see', 'hear', 'voice', 'realize', 'other', 'person', 'who', 'could', 'been', 'Loomis', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'was', 'ready', 'hate', 'Michael', 'did', ""n't"", 'still', 'think', 'too', 'big', 'was', 'effective', 'creepy', 'places', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'was', 'fun', 'choice', 'Sheriff', 'Brackett', 'other', 'B', 'movie', 'veterans', 'underused', 'discarded', 'not', 'long', 'introduced', 'violence', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'look', 'PG', 'rated', 'Brutal', 'violence', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'being', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'picture', 'stated', 'other', 'critics', 'However', 'did', 'feel', 'scene', 'here', 'there', 'were', 'quite', 'pointless', 'were', 'just', 'be', 'extreme', 'hardcore', 'Rob', 'could', ""n't"", 'dream', 'up', 'scares', 'wanted', 'just', 'jolt', 'people', 'again', 'score', 'teriffic', 'Bits', 'Carpetner', 'original', 'are', 'here', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'Tyler', 'Bates', 'own', 'Folks', ""n't"", 'hatchet', 'job', 'lot', 'Zombie', 'haters', 'Halloween', 'purists', 'am', 'one', 'are', 'ballyhooing', 'very', 'strong', 'interesting', 'film', 'had', 'hooked', 'start', 'finish', 'denying', 'nothing', 'will', 'ever', 'top', 'match', 'Carpenter', 'scary', 'classic', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'Halloween', 'original', 'first', 'really', 'give', 'out', 'classic', 'Halloween', 'vibe', 'especially', 'third', 'act', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'find', 'defending', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'fan', 'other', 'films', 'here', 'am', 'wicked', 'nasty', 'atmospheric', 'creepy', 'just', 'wild', 'ride', 'first', 'horror', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'really', 'grab', 'make', 'think', 'afterward', 'Rob', 'was', 'set', 'write', 'witty', 'attacks', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'use', 'Instead', 'say', 'thanks', 'thanks', 'making', 'Halloween', 'film', 'really', 'first', 'time', 'nearly', '30', 'years']",Halloween

The original movie is a classic in every way. Everything about the original (acting, music, plot) is spot on.Now I was feeling mixed emotions when I heard Halloween was going to be remade. Most likely because it's rare to find a decent remake to a movie. I kind of gave up hope on remakes especially after watching The Fog remake. That movie sucked on all levels! But I wanted to give this remake a chance especially as I am huge Halloween fan.After watching the first half of the movie, I will give Rob Zombie credit where it's due. He came from a different angle. He focused the first half of the movie on Michael's childhood. There was way to much talking. So much talking - I was falling asleep!Then it started to pick up after Michael is about to escape the hospital. What I was incredibly sickened by was having a rape scene in the movie. What the hell was Rob thinking putting a scene like that in this movie? Thank heavens, the forward skip button on the remote control exists.When we meet the characters, I was quite shocked by the amount of sexual references each character makes. I mean each character was incredibly boring. The actress playing Laurie Strode was constantly screaming. Giving me a complete headache. Even the actor played Dr Loomis was boring. The violence in this movie was incredibly horrible. Way to strong!I know with your average horror movie, you'll get the nudity, sex scenes and gore. But this movie was almost filled with too much of it. The only good thing about this movie was the music but that couldn't save it.So if you enjoy a horror movie with a lot of sex and violence.

1102420,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000VKL6Z2,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","This is a hard movie to review.  For one thing, I don't want to compare it to the original Halloween, since the original is supposed to be a classic and therefore, untouchable.Something was wrong with the pacing in this remade version though.The movie started off SO good when it was dealing with the little kid going crazy and killing everyone in sight.  He was being picked on at school by a bully, a stepfather that treated him poorly, and a sister he didn't like.  The only person the little boy liked was his mother.There was a disturbing aspect to the storyline in that watching the little boy kill people in graphic ways time and time again, you begin to realize for the boy there's no compassion for human life whatsoever.  A disturbing side of the horror genre when it deals with realistic and dangerous subjects such as that.They even touched upon the subject of whether the little boy actually felt anything when he was doing the killing.  Apparently not.This movie must have some kind of record for the most killings in a movie, haha.  Time and time again people would get slaughtered, smashed, stabbed, you name it, but the same unstoppable insane lunatic roaming the streets and suburbs.The main problem with the movie was how it started off so darn good and gradually got worse and worse until eventually you knew what was going to happen at the very end.  To me this is inexcusable for a movie that should have kept a consistent momentum that it had for the first hour or so.  Seriously, the first hour of the movie was pure horror perfection.  It just failed to keep the same exciting pace for the last 40 minutes or so because the final segments of the film were so predictable.The subject of the killer trying to find his sister had potential, but never delivered.

I thought THE DEVIL'S REJECTS was quite an improvement. Now, Zombie takes one of the all-time classic horror milestones and ""re-imagines"" it?? WTF?? I figured this would truly be a catastrophic failure! I put off seeing it for a year. Well, I watched HALLOWEEN last night, and couldn't believe how wrong I was! Zombie has not simply rehashed the original, he has recast it in a more modern and psychologically satisfying way. John Carpenter's Michael Myers was perfect for his day (and for any day, really)- a silent, faceless, relentless killing machine, without any personal history. A murderous enigma. Zombie has given Michael motivation and purpose. He has fleshed-out his childhood, much like HANNIBAL RISING did for Lector. I look at Zombie's HALLOWEEN as a seperate and completely different movie from the original. In the same way that I love both the originals and the remakes of DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE HILLS HAVE EYES for example, I can watch and enjoy either HALLOWEEN. Tyler Mane is an awesome, imposing Michael. He seems like he's 9 ft tall! Giving him a back-story did not lessen his horrifying and utterly lethal character. If anything, it added depth to the overall story. Still, either Michael- oldschool or new -is the stuff of wonderful, grisly nightmares...  P.S.- the number of cameos in this movie is wild!

1102426,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,B000VKL6Z2,Brian,"[8, 12]","I am going to come right out and admit that I was extremely impressed with Rob Zombie's ""Halloween.""His film has clearly already become the stuff of mass controversy. Most of that seemingly stems from the staunch defenders of John Carpenter's landmark original, who all curiously believe that Mr. Zombie has somehow committed a cardinal sin and defaced a highly revered genre classic. It was therefore understandable that I harbored some considerable degree of reluctance in voicing my own personal opinion. What, after all, could I possibly say in direct praise of Zombie's stellar achievement that would not automatically be meticulously scrutinized or dismissed? How many people would instantly and unfairly discredit my claim as a ""tried and true"" fan of horror simply because I dared to embrace a fresh angle on an already well established slasher?To be quite honest, I no longer cling to such minor concerns. We, as people, can nitpick all we want. The fact is, Rob Zombie is an obvious fan of Carpenter's work and boasts a great deal of respect for the material. He has perfectly captured the brooding atmosphere and bone-chilling dread that was sorely lacking from the last several threadbare sequels. How this is such a bad thing in the eyes of certain fans, I will more than likely never fathom. This movie, in as much the same vein as Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" merely takes the premise of Carpenter's initial vision and steers it in a completely different direction. Michael Myers has finally once again become the same blood-curdling boogeyman he was nearly thirty years ago. This realization is mostly fueled by the refreshing backstory Zombie has provided us within his film's opening act. Some viewers I have noticed seem to take issue with the whole ""white trash"" approach Zombie applies to Michael's family. But, from where I stand, it works. I base that conclusion around two supporting factors, the first of which concerns Michael's subdued portrayal in Carpenter's film. While he certainly was a very formidable and sinister presence, I always still found him altogether empty and one dimensional. There was no meat on his bones, no real motive behind his heinous crimes aside from what Dr. Loomis presumed was just ""pure evil."" That was always the one key gripe I had with Carpenter's vision, and it was also something I was more than delighted to see Rob Zombie address here so many years later. My second point deals more specifically with the fleshing out of Michael's family. I found this incredibly effective and had absolutely no problem with the bold liberties Zombie took by making Ronnie White, Michael's overly abusive and potty-mouthed stepfather, so utterly and ferociously loathsome. We may not want to admit it, but people of this wretched caliber do exist within our society. Whether such horrific conduct can ultimately drive somebody to mass murder can certainly be contested. Although, for the purpose of this totally fictional horror movie, I seriously believe it was a plot device that worked sheer wonders.As the movie segues back to Haddonfield in its second half, as most anyone already knows, Zombie shifts gears with a wonderfully nostalgic updating of ""Mr. Sandman"" and revisits more familiar territory with scenes lifted almost letter perfectly from the 1978 original. He takes us back to the same West Hollywood streets Carpenter utilized for his shoot and gives us a Haddonfield that, in many of the same ways, actually feels like an average everyday midwest american neighborhood. The set dressing and overall attention to detail is absolutely amazing!I also rather quite liked the casting. Malcolm McDowell, the new Dr. Loomis, openly admitted that he never actually viewed any of the prior films. He was apparently discouraged from doing so by Zombie, himself, who did not wish to see a carbon copy of the Donald Pleasance portrayal. Donald's contribution to the original series, it goes without saying, will always remain legendary. But, I do have to say that I found much to enjoy with Malcolm's spin on the character, as well. The same can also easily be said for Daeg Faerch and Tyler Mane, the actors behind Michael's two respective personas. I was especially taken by the emotional range young Faerch brought to Michael's childhood. He displayed great depth in a role that, as I have already outlined, did not previously offer it. And Tyler Mane is plain and simply awe-inspiring! I won't say anything outside the simple fact that I feel he is the single greatest actor to don the Michael Myers mask since Nick Castle. He really is that good and gives Michael a raw savagery he hasn't had in years!I have long since read up on all the many bonus features supplied within the forthcoming ""unrated"" DVD release. You can rest assured that I will most definitely be adding it to my collection.Okay, so, having voiced all of this, I must now unfortunately and very briefly touch upon a matter that I personally would rather not. That would entail most of the highly unnecessary and heated backlash I've seen dished out in recent months against the varying slasher fans who favored this particular production. The Carpenter purists can spout all the negativity they want about Rob Zombie. I have never seen his prior films, so I have nothing further to judge him by. People mostly tend to forget that he never claimed to be ""remaking"" John Carpenter's ""Halloween."" Zombie specifically stated, from day one, that he was putting his own unique stamp on this time-honored film and that is precisely what he has done. That is predominantly why this movie is called Rob Zombie's ""Halloween."" The fact that any one person enjoys this new film does not make them any less a true fan of John Carpenter's original. I find the idea that so many others vehemently disagree with that sentiment as laughable as it is pathetic. But, hey, so is the world we live in at times.Go figure.It's a slasher movie, not a political statement. Watch it, have fun with it, and appreciate it for what it is....a well-crafted and worthy companion piece to John Carpenter's classic.",5,Halloween Rejuvenated!,1197331200,"12 11,

Important considerations if one presumes to remake that daddy of slasher films, *Halloween*.Independent film master John Carpenter gave us the original, based on a screenplay co-written with Debra Hill. Dimension Films acquired the rights and after a string of terrible sequels, began looking to reboot the series. Along comes Rob Zombie.Up front, forget this noise about ""re-envisioning,"" or ""making it your own"", or ""a film for a new generation"". I only care about good movies. Movies with smarts and maturity, from plot to acting to editing. Movies that love themselves and love their audiences too. Like Quentin Tarantino or Eli Roth, Rob Zombie combines a respect for his roots with the skill and vision to apply them. With a couple exceptions, *Halloween* is such a slasher movie.Mainly because Zombie chucks out the supernatural canards in favor of a true crime sensibility. Nuts to that stuff about the curse of Samhain. The real horror comes from a dirt head little boy in a Kiss t-shirt, who takes enough abuse with too little love to become a psychopath. The first half of the movie charts Michael Meyer's transition into murder, complete with screaming parents, indifferent siblings, and schoolyard bullies. By the time school authorities discover evidence of the boy's madness, things become famously, dramatically too late.Plenty of horror movies have a vignette or a toss-away speech to explain their villains. Rob Zombie spends two whole acts to show how Meyers is shaped by his environment to become The Shape. Along these lines he develops actual relationships between the killer and other people, most notably that of his mother, a janitor, and Dr. Sam Loomis. The mother and doctor in particular play much longer and deeper roles than in the original film, contributing greatly to my interest. But even the sister and father get more screen time and development in terms of Michael's growing addiction to death.That Zombie fills in gaps is another mark of the film's quality. We see when Michael finally crosses the line from a troubled boy to a speechless murder machine. How he escapes imprisonment. How Meyers acquires his mask and coveralls. How he knows to stalk the virgin babysitter Laurie and her not-so-virgin friends.And stalk he does. For Zombie's vision is dark, literally as well as figuratively. A selective use of slow motion, sound effects, and low-end rhythms in the soundtrack evoke night-time terrors even during the day. It makes heavy use of source lighting to create thick shadows. For that matter, a lot of the sound is source-based too, and Zombie sometimes uses deep throated sirens or high pitched baby screams as a substitute for ambient music. The film itself is saturated to emphasize dark colors, and even broad daylight looks as if shot through a grimy window.The blood is dark red to black, which probably helped this movie get an ""R"" instead of an ""NC-17"". It also helps that, as usual for horror movies, most of The Shape's victims are unsympathetic--it's always okay to kill cops, abusive dads, truckers, and sluts in the movies.  And as usual, we don't see the death of animals or little kids. We even get the old clich&eacute;' of a loathsome punk being killed, to foreshadow another character's prowess. I don't knock the movie much for this, though, because *Halloween* comes from that sort of tradition. The most ""innocent"" victims are still portrayed as schmucks, and indeed one of the recurrent themes in Rob Zombie movies is that the public is too naive and ill-equipped to deal with psychos.Speaking of violence and themes, Zombie eschews the current trend in dismemberments and arterial sprays. He also avoids the 1980's trend of lingering on the murder weapon as if it were a phallus. Instead, Mike Meyers lands fierce, rapid blows; he does not stab so much as bludgeon. And while he does not torture his victims, they die more painfully and terror-stricken than in *Hostel*. Because where Zombie does linger is the moment of expiration, and so *Halloween* is a death fan's delight. People gurgle and twitch in bathtub-sized pools of blood, as their killer looks them in their bulging eyes... Typically, the majority of time the camera skips over a death scene is when the victim is an animal.Indeed, the one sin of this film is not brutality, but boredom. The Shape kills about 21 characters, most of them extras or cameos, and I began to tire around 17. By the time Meyers stalks the babysitters, the murders play more like the original: faster, less bloody, but more cinematic. Yet it was too late; the pursuit of the Laurie character dragged further, with multiple escapes and captures and false deaths. I never got the sense that Zombie was aware of how much the story dragged in the last half-hour. He only changed his portrayal of murder when he wanted to bring his vision closer to that of Carpenter, or to avoid upsetting PETA.Zombie's own sin then, is that he doesn't give his audience enough credit. Believe me, Rob: I study violence and psychopathy; I spent eight years in the military, I know plenty of violence victims, and I am a witness to violence myself. So I got the point before I even stepped into the theater. I wanted to be entertained, and that doesn't happen when I start to yawn. I have three murder scenes in mind that could be altered to a non-fatal attack, or cut altogether, and the climatic chase can also stand to shave about two minutes.So yeah, I liked the first half of the movie, which consisted mainly of original material and real shocks, than the more derivative second. That's not the final word on this movie. It's a damn sight better than most, let alone all horror remakes I've seen. Most of the latter suck because they are made by commercial and music video directors who have no competency or love for the source material.  It's further obvious that Hollywood has become too cheap and risk-adverse to make original films. I tend stay away from the theater as a result.Rob Zombie, himself a music video director, is that rare fellow who can make water better than most people can make a movie. That's a strong statement from a guy who doesn't believe in brownnosing, and I solicit it freely because it's the truth. If you want to see a good movie in general, not just a good slasher, see Zombie's remake of *Halloween*.",4,"Hallowed Ween: Heckuva Job, Zombie!",1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,6911,"['Few',

1102428,A3PERVDBNCQJQV,B000VKL6Z2,"Brian R Yandle ""Brian R Yandle""","[1, 2]","As far as horror remakes go, I'm usually quick to write them as nothing more than just Hollywood's way of saying they have no other tricks up their sleeve & a remake is perhaps the best thing that could be done. Sadly, horror remakes rarely are as innovative nor as entertaining as the originals & most of them are financial flops at the box office. With the mere exception of perhaps a few, I could very well skip most of them altogether & not miss a beat honestly. In recent years, most of the remakes cater to the teeny bopper crowd & select few deserve our attention. Zombie's take on the Carpenter classic Halloween is one of the more tolerable exercises in futility for our times.As anyone will tell you, the future of horror films may look somewhat more positive with the strange but powerful presence of Rob Zombie standing behind a camera. His determination & sincere dedication to making great scary flicks is hopeful to say the least as no one out there wants to really scare us anymore nor craft anything that will merit a solid R-rating. God forbid you make a film which is steeped in heavy violence & gore that may warrant a very cool but undesired NC-17 rating. (Now that's what I'm talking about.) Zombie, however, is very capable of straddling the hardcore horror world while keeping the mainstream masses in check. Kudos to Zombie for sure!!Let me begin by saying I've never been a fan of the original Halloween series per se. For some unearthly reason, I simply cannot fathom the concept of a child who is simply evil &enjoys; killing for the fun of it. A great many slasher films have been made throughout the years which are nothing particularly special but yet the villains' motivation for killing is often justified in some fashion. In Carpenter's original film, we never get a clear understanding of why Michael kills which makes Halloween a cop-out in my opinion & nothing more than a springboard to deliver some cheap thrills.Zombie does get it right & I give him props for atleast giving us a solid hour of Myer's history before releasing the slasher bloodbath with a heavy body count. Malcolm McDowell gives a bang up performance as Dr. Loomis, who tries very hard through the years to work with young Myers with no success whatsover. Rob's take on the original clearly explains much of Myer's psychological motivation which spirals into an inevitable homicidal explosion. In fact, most of the viewers are more than likely to feel sorry for the little guy this time around whereas we never really felt any sympathy in the original film nor any of the horrendous sequels.The second half of the film is nothing more than your average chills & thrills horror flick. Zombie has a keen eye for visuals & special effects, the remainder of his film is just your typical slasher fare which is decent but don't expect anything revolutionary here. While most of the movie isn't very scary, there are some cringe-worthy moments that will more than likely satisfy genre enthusiasts everywhere or fans of the original series. I just wish Zombie had found a better actress to take on the role of Laurie Strode. I'm sorry but she will never hold a candle to the incomparable Jamie Lee Curtis. That's just small potatoes I'm sure but Scout Talor-Comption is an annoying actress or maybe her part was poorly written. Perhaps a combination of both?This is, quite possibly, one of the better horror remakes I've seen with the exception of Aja's Hills Have Eyes.

This obviously pales in comparison to the original Halloween but we shouldn't compare.Scout Taylor Compton was awful in this. She was the biggest disappointment in the film. Malcom Mcdowell had the difficult task of trying to create a new Dr. Loomis after Donald Pleasence had cemented his place in history as one of the most beloved and greatest horror protagonist and hero. He was viewed as an honorable man here he is different. Dr. Loomis cares for Myers, wants to protect the teenagers from him but is also a little into himself trying to make money off his book. Danielle Harris was awesome in this. She gave stellar performances in Halloween 4 and 5 which made it feel nostalgic. A touch of the old with the new.Harris was great in the role of Annie and made up for Compton's atrocious performance. A nice touch is having most of the cast of The Devils Rejects make cameos in Halloween. It's nice to see Sid Haig, Bill Mosley and others in here. Brad Douriff is a great actor. He did good in this and played a bigger part than his character did in the original version. His character was the most likable in the film. Daeg Faerch did a great job in this. I thought he gave one of the best performances in the movie as a young Myers. He looked the part and did a great acting job. Sherri Moon Zombie did pretty good in this one as Myers mother. I found her to be likable and her acting was not bad in this film.The first half of this movie seems to be all Rob's vision and then the second back to the original story. I think overall hardcore fans of the series will enjoy this film. I think Rob Zombie fans will like it. I think you have to try to be fair to it. No one is going to equal what Carpenter did but this movie is still fun. I think some people may not have liked the different take on Dr. Loomis character I think there will only be one Dr. Loomis but it was good they took his character in another direction instead of a carbon copy of Pleasence. So my two favorite things about this movie was Malcom Mcdowell and Danielle Harris. We had a quality actor playing Loomis and a actress who was a big part of the original franchise. I recommend this movie to all horror fans.

I thought the white-trash element at the beginning of the movie showing Michael's upbringing was perfect.  It was simultaneously gritty and funny in a way that few directors would have been able to pull off.  And it was exactly what was needed to bring the viewer into the movie and show us SOME of what contributed to the monster Michael became.  I emphasize ""some"" because I've seen reviews where it is claimed that Mike Myers is supposed to be just pure evil and was born that way.  Well what's to say that that isn't the case?  He just had some extra grief in the form of abusive step-dad, abusive sister, abusive schoolmates to contribute to his psychopathy.  He started off killing animals and being obsessed with dead animals.  That isn't something that just occurs because of poor upbringing.  Jeffrey Dahmer had a fine upbringing and look what he turned into.People complained about bad acting.  I thought the acting was just fine, even from the young girls.  It had good music, as all Rob Zombie films do.  I saw nothing wrong with Malcolm McDowall's lines as some people have complained about.  Sheri Moon's acting was top-notch.  She has become one of my favorite actresses for being able to take on harsh roles while still being able to act sweet at the same time.  As someone who I think has been thrust into movies and didn't aspire to become an actress, she has done well.  She has progressed in her acting ability since The Devil's Rejects.It saddens me to see all the negative reviews from people who just can't get over the fact that Rob made something original and didn't just remake the exact same movie.  Maybe this is why I saw Rob say in an interview that he is done making horror movies.  Rob, I hope you reconsider, because the horror movie world needs you.And as a disclaimer, I'm not a fan of Rob Zombie's music, despite the fact that I love metal.

I am a major fan of Michael Myers and the entire HALLOWEEN series, so you ought to believe how excited I was to see this film when Rob Zombie had finished it. Little did I know that this remake was even more incredible than I had anticipated. I was expecting a great remake, and what I saw was not great; it was fu*BEEP*ing outstanding. Rob Zombie went into a completely different direction with his remake, a direction so different that this remake does the original film so much more justice.The film starts on Halloween, introducing MICHAEL MYERS (played by Daeg Faerch) , a troubled ten year old boy. In his room, Michael admires Elvis, a pet rat, while wearing a clown mask. Downstairs, his mother DEBORAH MYERS (played by Sherri Moon Zombie, Rob Zombie's sexy wife) argues with her crippled boyfriend RONNIE WHITE (played by William Forsythe) and Michael's sister JUDITH MYERS (played by Hannah R. Hall). Michael, in the bathroom washing a small bloody knife, is called downstairs by Judith. Ronnie berates him, teasing him for wearing masks all the time. Later at school, Michael is confronted by WESLEY RHODES (played by Daryl Sabara), a bully, and his friend. Wesley teases Michael, threatening to make copies of a newspaper advertisement for The Rabbit in Red, a strip club where Michael's mother works. A fight ensues and Deborah is called into the school to speak with DR. SAMUEL J. LOOMIS (played by Malcolm McDowell), a child psychologist. Loomis wants to evaluate Michael, after the school found a dead cat and numerous photographs of dead animals in Michael's backpack. Michael, overhearing the conversation, leaves the office and follows Wesley Rhodes into the woods. Donning his clown mask, Michael brutally beats the bully with a sturdy tree branch. While Wesley begs for mercy, Michael finds the advertisement in his coat pocket. He takes it before murdering Rhodes.At home, Ronnie and Michael are watching a movie on television as Deborah is about to leave for work. Before leaving, she tells Michael that every thing will be better soon. She leaves, and Judith is left to take Michael trick-or-treating. However, Judith's boyfriend STEVE shows up, canceling Michael's trick-or-treat plans. Ronnie falls asleep on the couch, leaving Steve and Judith to have sex in her room. Michael, again donning his clown mask, proceeds to duct tape Ronnie to the couch, where Michael then violently slits Ronnie's throat. Upstairs, Steve and Judith finish having sex, and he puts on the infamous William Shatner mask, wanting to have sex with the mask on. Judith refuses, and Steve goes downstairs to make some food. While in the kitchen, Michael sneaks up on Steve and bludgeons him with an aluminum baseball bat. With Judith asleep upstairs, Michael finds and puts on the white mask. He enters Judith's room, and places his hand on her leg. Mistaking him for Steve, Judith turns and questions the silent Michael, slapping him. He then stabs her in the stomach with a kitchen knife. As she stumbles through the halls of the house, Michael follows, stabbing her a total of seventeen times. He then enters the baby's room and takes her out to the porch. Deborah returns home from work, finding Michael and the baby on the porch. The police arrive, and Michael is taken into custody.Eleven months later, Michael is committed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Loomis. In recorded therapy sessions with Loomis, Michael claims to not remember anything about killing. As Deborah has weekly visitation rights, Michael now creates and wears masks at all times. By Christmas, Loomis and Michael are screaming at each other. Eventually, Michael stops talking. During a visit, Deborah gives Michael a picture of him holding his baby sister. Moments later, as Loomis is about to walk Deborah to her car, Michael stabs an overseeing nurse in the throat with a fork. At the Myers home, Deborah is watching old home movies of Michael, crying. She then proceeds to commit suicide by shooting herself in the head.Fifteen years later, Loomis tells a 27-year-old MICHAEL MYERS (played by Tyler Mane), who hasn't said a word in 15 years, that he is no longer going to be his psychologist. That same night, Smith's Grove plans on transferring Michael to a maximum security prison. Before the asylum police can transfer him, Michael kills them, and eventually the majority of the Smith's Grove staff. He escapes, and runs into a truck driver named Big Joe Grizzley. Michael confronts him in the bathroom, and kills him, stealing his coveralls. Michael completes his journey by returning to his home. Under the floorboards, he finds the knife with which he murdered his family, and the white William Shatner mask, now tarnished and dirty.The story shifts to that of LAURIE STRODE (played by Scout Taylor-Compton). Laurie is living a happy life with her parents, CYNTHIA STRODE (played by Dee Wallace) and MASON STRODE (played by Pat Skipper). As she heads off to school, Laurie is met by TOMMY DOYLE (played by Skyler Gosondo), a boy she babysits. They pass the old Myers home, where Laurie must drop off an envelope for her father. Tommy warns her not to go near the house, as the boogeyman lives there. Laurie toys with Tommy, while Michael watches from inside the house. At school, Laurie and her best friends, ANNIE BRACKETT (played by Danielle Harris) and LYNDA van der KLOK (played by Kristina Klebe), make plans for Halloween night as Laurie notices Michael watching her from outside. Annie convinces Laurie to babysit for her that night, so Annie can meet with her boyfriend Paul. Meanwhile, Loomis arrives in Haddonfield to find the Myers's gravestone missing and the grave vandalized with a crucified animal carcass. On the way home from school, Laurie notices Michael again, and Lynda and Annie mock him. Annie is picked up by her father, LEE BRACKETT (played by Brad Dourif, the voice of Chucky, the killer doll), the town sheriff, who offers Annie a ride home. Lynda also eventually leaves, and Laurie is followed home by Michael. That evening, Laurie leaves her home with Annie to babysit at Tommy's house. After they leave, Michael murders the Strode family. Michael then returns to his house, only to find Lynda and her boyfriend, BOB SIMMS (played by Mick Mennell), having sex. Bob leaves the living room to get more beer, and is met halfway back by Michael, who impales him to a wall with his knife. Michael puts a sheet over his head while wearing Bob's glasses. Lynda mistakes Michael for Bob, and as she turns around, Michael strangles her to death.At the Doyle house, Annie leaves Lindsey Wallace with Laurie and Tommy. Annie then returns home to be with her boyfriend PAUL (played by Max van Ville). While they have sex, Michael comes and murders Paul, while severely beating Annie. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brackett, convinced by Loomis that Michael is in Haddonfield, is searching the town in his patrol car. He tells Loomis that he responded to the 9-1-1 call for Deborah Myers's suicide. He found the young baby sister, but did not want her to grow up knowing what happened to her family. He took her to a foster home, where she was adopted by the Strode family.Laurie heads back to the Wallace home to take by Lindsey, when they two find the bodies of Paul and Annie. Paul is dead, hung from the ceiling rafters with a jack o' lantern on his head, while Annie is severely injured, but alive. Laurie tells Lindsey to go back to Tommy's house, while she calls 9-1-1. As Lindsey leaves, Michael, who was hiding behind the door, shuts it, and begins to chase Laurie. Laurie outruns Michael to the Doyle house, and she and the children look themselves in a room. As police officers arrive, Michael kills the officers, breaks into the bathroom and takes Laurie. Loomis and Brackett, responding to Laurie's 9-1-1 call, finally arrive at Lindsey's house to find Annie still alive on the floor. Loomis leaves, only to see Tommy and Lindsey, screaming in the street. They tell him where Michael went, and Loomis follows, armed with a .357 Magnum handgun.Laurie awakes in the Myers house, next to the gravestone of Judith Myers and the naked body of Lynda. Michael enters, placing his knife on the ground and taking off his mask. He kneels down and offers Laurie his picture of them as children. Laurie cries and tells him she doesn't understand, but then reaches for the knife and stabs Michael in the shoulder. Laurie slips away, but Michael corners her after she falls into a drained swimming pool. Loomis appears and shoots Michael three times. He falls, evidently dead. Loomis gets Laurie inside the police car, where Laurie asks, ""Was that the boogeyman?"" Loomis responds, ""As a matter of fact, I do believe that was."" Michael suddenly breaks through the window and grabs Laurie. Loomis chases after them, and tells Michael he was the one who failed by giving up on him. Michael lets Laurie go, and grabs Loomis, crushing his skull.Laurie hides inside the Myers house as Michael drags Loomis's body inside. Michael searches for Laurie, smashing the frail walls. Laurie grabs Loomis's gun, and hides in the attic. Michael then grabs a plank of wood, and begins bashing it through the ceiling. Laurie nearly escapes, but falls through the ceiling into a bedroom. Michael enters the room, and as she raises the gun, he charges at her sending both through the second story window to the ground below. Laurie comes to, lying on top of an unconscious Myers and attempts to shoot him, but the first few shots are empty. Michael recovers, grabbing Laurie's hand as she shoots again. The gun fires, hitting Michael in the head. Laurie, covered with blood, screams in terror as the film abruptly cuts to credits.As I said before, Rob Zombie's remake of the 1978 Horror classic, is simply outstanding.

When Rob Zombie said he was remaking it I flipped becuase I am a huge fan of his since White Zombie and loved all his other movies. This movie not only did John Carpenters justice I think Zombie actually out did it. I try to see as many of the horror remakes I can because I am a big fan of Horror classics and the genre in general. Most of the remakes have been lame or over gorified. This one is by far the best remake I have ever seen and still managed to creep me out when I saw it in theaters. There are only a few remakes I would consider good but this one was Amazing.

1102446,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000VKL6Z2,Chris Pandolfi,"[11, 15]","The writing was on the wall. The past twenty years have seen remakes of such beloved horror classics like ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""The Omen,"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""; because of that, I guess the idea of remaking John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" was not so far fetched, after all. Of course, that got everyone wondering: Can this new version in any way, shape, or form live up to expectations? Having seen it, I can say without a doubt that the answer is yes. Quite frankly, this is one of the best horror remakes I've ever seen, updating the original story into a dark, gritty, and stylistic fright fest. As far as remakes are concerned, I'd say that this is in the same league as John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" or Marcus Nispel's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""Taking the reigns from Carpenter is Rob Zombie, who's first movie--""House of 1,000 Corpses""--gave the horror genre a rejuvenating boost. While the film itself was unfocused and derivative, it's style was eye catching; watching it, I knew that, if given the right material, Zombie would be the skillful horror filmmaker he set out to be. He's lived up to that potential with ""Halloween,"" a film that does a masterful job of updating--but not rehashing--the original 1978 film. Carpenter's version was brilliant in its ability to build tension, keeping masked madman Michael Myers hidden in shadow, having him strike at just the right moments. Zombie's version is also brilliant, but not in the same way: he gives the film a primal edge that perfectly captures the rage and evil that is Michael Myers.This is a good thing, especially since Zombie has created a much more compelling and understandable Michael Myers back-story, beginning in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. As a ten-year-old boy (Daeg Faerch), Myers was disturbed, showing psychopathic behavior by hurting and killing animals. He also lived in a troubled household, with a verbally abusive stepfather (William Forsythe) and an uncaring, promiscuous older sister (Hanna Hall). The only person he loved--the only person who loved him back--was his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie), who earned a living as an exotic dancer. Everything changed fifteen years ago, on Halloween night; in a fit of rage, Myers savagely murdered his stepfather, his sister, and her boyfriend (both of whom refused to take him Trick-or-Treating).Eleven months later, Myers was institutionalized at the Smith Grove Sanitarium and put under the care of child psychologist Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell). He noticed how disconnected the boy was from the world, seeming unaware of what he did, continuously covering his face with masks made out of paper and crayon. The murder of a nurse permanently closed him off, leaving his mother heartbroken and Loomis baffled.The story then flashes forward to the present day. Now in his mid-twenties, Myers (Tyler Mane) is mute and obsessed with wearing masks. After learning that Loomis plans to stop all forms of therapy, Myers uses unnatural physical strength to escape during a patient transfer. His attacks are savage, using violence that's quick, raw, unnerving, and ultimately bloody (it should be noted that the aftermath of every murder is far gorier than anything seen in Carpenter's original film). After killing a truck driver in a rest stop bathroom and stealing his jumpsuit, Myers heads back to Haddonfield on Halloween, taking residence in his abandoned childhood home and covering his face with a dirty white mask hidden beneath the floor.From here, the film effectively pays homage to many of the original film's subtler nuances. We meet Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her friends Lynda (Kristina Klebe) and Annie (Danielle Harris, who played Jamie Strode in the fourth and fifth ""Halloween"" sequels). The three are typical high school girlfriends: popular, pretty, and boy-crazy. Both Laurie and Annie spend Halloween night babysitting, which introduces us to young Lindsay (Jenny Gregg Stewart) and Tommy (Skyler Gisondo). Like the Tommy of the original film, this new Tommy is curious about the Boogyman, so much so that it begins to annoy Laurie.As the film draws to a close, it becomes a taut, suspenseful ride, pitting the unlucky teenagers--primarily Laurie--against an incurable killing machine. If you haven't seen the original films, then I can't tell you why Laurie becomes his target; let's just say that the two are somehow connected. They play against each other during the final scenes, all of which crescendo to screaming heights. Zombie did not hold back in his attempts to frighten the audience, which is appropriate given the kind of film ""Halloween"" is. Just as Carpenter's original version defined the Teen Slasher film, Zombie's version defines creative reinterpreting; he took a well-established story and gave it some fresh blood, resulting in a frightening new film that respectfully pays tribute to its source (example: the inclusion of the original ""'Halloween' Theme""). If you appreciate the art of horror filmmaking, then Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is the movie for you.",5,The Night HE Came Home Redux,1188518400,"08 31, 2007",2007,5096,"['writing', 'was', 'wall',

This film was cursed from the start. A remake of a classic horror movie like Halloween is a daring and risky move! The man in the drivers seat...Rob Zombie. An interesting choice for a director but none the less the film was doomed right from the start. ""Die hard fans"" of the original (like myself) were astonished that Malek Akkad would dare and copy the original classic! But wait a second...the sequels have gotten very stale. Is this the appropriate direction? All in all Rob Zombie's version of Halloween is an entirely different film from the original. I think it was pretty smart to change the direction of the film some so one does make the same mistake that Gus Van Sant did with ""Psycho"". Now the question: Was the remake better than the original? The answer is - No way, not even close! However, this film compliments the original very well. I was surprised with the quality of the film as Rob Zombie is a fairly good director. The film was filled with foul language, nudity and alot of gore! As any good horror movie should be! The casting was well done. Apparently Rob Zombie used the entire cast from his previous movie in Halloween, but I have not seen either of his other two movies, so I don't care in the least. The girl playing Laurie was well cast. Finally Laurie was attractive! Malcolm McDowell as Loomis was brilliant and I loved him in the role. Still nowhere near as good as Donald Pleasence but again, who expected him to be? The back story written into the movie was well done. The little boy who played young Michael Myers managed to creep me out, so that says alot. Michael who is like 10 feet tall in this version is scary again. The ending can go either way for the fans. I happened to LOVE the ending myself, but I am clearly in the minority here! Before you pass judgement on this film, see it. The film BANKED in the theaters and the inevitible sequel is sure to follow.

Gibbs ""Horror Soundtrack Collector""","[15, 25]","Rob Zombie's re-visioning of the original classic 'Halloween' completely strips it of what it once was and stood for.  Our pal Michael was a silent, stealthy, suspenseful and tricky lad back in the day, hiding in the shadows and laying traps for his victims.  Back then, he represented a more subtle horror icon over his buddies Jason and Freddy.Enter the new Michael, complete with a back story.  Zombie paints a killer whose redneck family abused him and whose young compassion is stripped by seemingly mindless violence.  The mystery behind Michael is completely thrwarted by Zombie, who feels it necessary to expose Michael as an everyday human being, unlike Carpenters 'The Child is just plain evil' theory.Twelve or thirteen killings later, we have the older Michael, built like  WWF wrestler and a senseless killing machine.  Murder, sex, murder, cameo, murder, sex, murder, etc.  Blah, blah, blah.  Timing is terrible in this movie and there is no suspense.  You know everyone is going to die and you don't care about any of them.  Michael becomes a bore and laughable as well.  The old bush scene and laundry line scene are replaced by myers just standing around in broad daylight while the three young girls look across the street at him.The ending is hardly memorable and the movie overall is a complete mess.  I liked some things about the rawness of 'House of 1,000 Corpses' and the 'Devils Rejects', but this film has nothing to borrow from them and ends up killing a classic.  It's a good slasher film if you can forget everything you know about Michael Myers and Halloween.  I, unfortunately, cannot easily forget.  And I will not forgive Mr. Zombie for such a worthless, effortless and talent-less re-visioning of an immortal horror classic.  If you can't stick to the basics of good horror, such as suspense, sympathy for the characters and overall intrigue, stick to music or your infamous 'Texas Chainsaw', um, I mean 'Devil's Rejects'movies.",1,Horror's Reject..,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,1962,"['Rob', 'Zombie', 're-visioning', 'original', 'classic', 'completely', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'stood', 'pal', 'Michael', 'was', 'silent', 'stealthy', 'suspenseful', 'tricky', 'lad', 'back', 'day', 'hiding', 'shadows', 'laying', 'traps', 'victims', 'Back', 'then', 'represented', 'more', 'subtle', 'horror', 'icon', 'buddies', 'Jason', 'Freddy.Enter', 'new', 'Michael', 'complete', 'back', 'story', 'Zombie', 'killer', 'redneck', 'family', 'abused', 'young', 'compassion', 'stripped', 'seemingly', 'mindless', 'violence', 'mystery', 'Michael', 'completely', 'thrwarted', 'Zombie', 'who', 'necessary', 'expose', 'Michael', 'everyday', 'human', 'being', 'Carpenters', 'Child', 'just', 'plain', 'evil', 'theory.Twelve', 'thirteen', 'killings', 'later', 'have', 'older', 'Michael', 'built', 'WWF', 'wrestler', 'senseless', 'killing', 'machine', 'Murder', 'sex', 'murder', 'cameo', 'murder', 'sex', 'murder', 'etc', 'Blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'Timing', 'terrible', 'movie', 'suspense', 'know', 'everyone', 'going', 'die', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Michael', 'bore', 'laughable', 'as', 'well', 'old', 'bush', 'scene', 'laundry', 'line', 'scene', 'are', 'replaced', 'myers', 'just', 'standing', 'around', 'broad', 'daylight', 'three', 'young', 'girls', 'look', 'street', 'him.The', 'ending', 'hardly', 'memorable', 'movie', 'overall', 'complete', 'mess', 'liked', 'things', 'rawness', ""'House"", '1,000', 'Corpses', ""'Devils"", 'Rejects', 'film', 'nothing', 'borrow', 'up', 'killing', 'classic', 'good', 'slasher', 'film', 'can', 'forget', 'everything', 'know', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Halloween', 'unfortunately', 'can', 'not', 'easily', 'forget', 'will', 'not', 'forgive', 'Mr.', 'Zombie', 'such', 'worthless', 'effortless', 'talent-less', 're-visioning', 'immortal', 'horror', 'classic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stick', 'basics', 'good', 'horror', 'such', 'suspense', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'overall', 'intrigue', 'stick', 'music', 'infamous', 'Chainsaw', 'um', 'mean', ""Rejects'movies""]",Halloween
1102452,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000VKL6Z2,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 6]","There's a scene in the original Halloween where through the camera's POV complete with holes functioning as our eyes, we follow a figure walk through a house, grab a knife and proceed upstairs to viciously attack a young girl only for it at the end to be a young boy in a clown mask. Later he grows into an unstoppable killing machine that stalks and terrorizes comes after you and no bullet or knife can stop him. It was that feeling of an evil that would continously coming after you that made ""the Shape"" such a memorable horror icon. Apparently that notion was lost on Rob Zombie who thought that clearly we need an explanation as to why he'd be such a monster (beware of hick families is the message here) and not only from a story standpoint but from a filmmaking one as well, the new Halloween just hits all the wrong notes - no pun intended, Mr. Zombie - the whole time.Michael Myers is a seriously disturbed young boy growing up with a promiscuous sister, a controlling father figure and a stripper mother who at least tries to help. But after viciously killing his family, save his mother, Michael is institutionalized under care of Dr. Samuel Loomis. But 15 years pass and Michael escapes and makes his way back to his home of Haddonfield where he tries to track down his baby sister, Laurie.Whereas ""the Shape"" of 1978 liked to appear in the shadows, ominously watching teenagers unaware to his presence, this new guy likes to just mindlessly bash stuff in and be as loud as possible (he's like one of those hulking brutes with the deep voice and lack of intelligence that school bullies have for protection) and this practically sucks the suspense right from the film. Remember that scene where Michael sits right up behind Laurie who doesn't see him? Nothing like that here. Not to mention the gaps in the story like the lack of trick-or-treaters, Michael's seemingly psychic knowledge of Laurie's school schedule, her present appearance, much less her name. Then of course there's things in the filmmaking spectrum like out-of-focus shots, out-of-character decisions and dialogue, continuity errors like crazy and just strange cuts (in one scene, Laurie is behind hauled away by Michael kicking and screaming and in the next shot, she's passed out being carried off by Michael. Uh, did he punch her out?) With the Zombie trademark of characters swearing with reckless abandon, and I might add, zero creativity, this Halloween version is just unfortunate.As far as casting is concerned, the Samuel Loomis of this one, played by Malcolm Macdowell is a good one and the young boy playing Michael is good as well while the rest either overact, don't act enough or just not simply given nothing to do. The new Laurie, played by Scout Taylor-Compton, is easy on the eyes but she almost seems to be given one direction: be cute and scream your face off when the terror starts. The casting is just one of many a problem that the film faces and quite simply, there's just not enough to recommend.In all good seriousness, I just can't recommend this. Sure it does stand out from Carpenter's original and not just a clone and the idea of exploring the evil sounds like a good idea but this is just one unfortunate business of a film.",2,One of the all around bad movies this year,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,3237,"['scene', 'original', 'Halloween', 'where', 'camera', 'POV', 'complete', 'holes', 'functioning', 'eyes', 'follow', 'figure', 'walk', 'house', 'grab', 'knife', 'proceed', 'upstairs', 'viciously', 'attack', 'young', 'girl', 'only', 'end', 'be', 'young', 'boy', 'clown', 'mask', 'Later', 'unstoppable', 'killing', 'machine', 'stalks', 'terrorizes', 'bullet', 'knife', 'can', 'stop', 'was', 'feeling', 'evil', 'would', 'continously', 'coming', 'made', 'Shape', 'memorable', 'horror', 'icon', 'Apparently', 'notion', 'was', 'lost', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'who', 'thought', 'clearly', 'need', 'explanation', 'why', ""'d"", 'be', 'such', 'monster', 'beware', 'hick', 'families', 'message', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'standpoint', 'filmmaking', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'Halloween', 'just', 'wrong', 'notes', 'pun', 'intended', 'Mr.', 'Zombie', 'whole', 'time.Michael', 'Myers', 'seriously', 'disturbed', 'young', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'promiscuous', 'sister', 'controlling', 'father', 'figure', 'stripper', 'mother', 'who', 'least', 'tries', 'help', 'viciously', 'killing', 'family', 'save', 'mother', 'Michael', 'institutionalized', 'care', 'Dr.', 'Samuel', 'Loomis', '15', 'years', 'pass', 'Michael', 'escapes', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'Haddonfield', 'where', 'track', 'down', 'baby', 'sister', 'Laurie.Whereas', 'Shape', '1978', 'liked', 'appear', 'shadows', 'ominously', 'watching', 'teenagers', 'unaware', 'presence', 'new', 'guy', 'just', 'mindlessly', 'bash', 'stuff', 'be', 'as', 'loud', 'possible', 'one', 'hulking', 'brutes', 'deep', 'voice', 'lack', 'intelligence', 'school', 'bullies', 'have', 'protection', 'practically', 'suspense', 'right', 'film', 'Remember', 'scene', 'where', 'Michael', 'right', 'up', 'Laurie', 'who', ""n't"", 'see', 'Nothing', 'here', 'Not', 'mention', 'gaps', 'story', 'lack', 'trick-or-treaters', 'Michael', 'seemingly', 'psychic', 'knowledge', 'Laurie', 'school', 'schedule', 'present', 'appearance', 'much', 'less', 'name', 'Then', 'course', 'things', 'filmmaking', 'spectrum', 'out-of-focus', 'shots', 'out-of-character', 'decisions', 'dialogue', 'continuity', 'errors', 'crazy', 'just', 'strange', 'cuts', 'one', 'scene', 'Laurie', 'hauled', 'away', 'Michael', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'next', 'shot', 'passed', 'out', 'being', 'carried', 'off', 'Michael', 'Uh', 'did', 'punch', 'out', 'Zombie', 'trademark', 'characters', 'swearing', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'might', 'add', 'zero', 'creativity', 'Halloween', 'version', 'just', 'unfortunate.As', 'far', 'casting', 'concerned', 'Samuel', 'Loomis', 'one', 'played', 'Malcolm', 'Macdowell', 'good', 'one', 'young', 'boy', 'playing', 'Michael', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'overact', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'enough', 'just', 'not', 'simply', 'given', 'nothing', 'do', 'new', 'Laurie', 'played', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'easy', 'eyes', 'almost', 'be', 'given', 'one', 'direction', 'be', 'cute', 'scream', 'face', 'when', 'terror', 'casting', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'problem', 'film', 'quite', 'simply', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'recommend.In', 'good', 'seriousness', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Sure', 'stand', 'out', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'not', 'just', 'clone', 'idea', 'exploring', 'evil', 'good', 'idea', 'just', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'business', 'film']",Halloween

1102455,A6UW2KEO5UOSA,B000VKL6Z2,"Corey Turner ""The Musician""","[2, 2]","Many can understand the disappointment a remake can bring, but viewing it in a different perspective really helps. Nine times out of ten a remake fails to restore the magic the original held so high. Even with a large budget, powerful cultish fanbase, and inspired crew some movies just fail to deliver. Here we are with Halloween, a classic slasher from the late 70's. Holding key elements many slashers would religiously follow in the near future, Halloween spawned many seqauls but non seemed to really live up all as well. Also note Halloween (the original) was filmed with a measly budget.Excessive gore, nudity, and screams dust off any filler most halloween films hold. Which is not positive thing, the frugal use of these really aided more in the dynamic swift kills the original held high. Instead of tension and release we get a snapshot of the masked maniacs childhood. With a rather long segment devoted to the development of a psychotic youths background, we are then bombarded with a short clean of suspense gore fest. It summarizes the original films story so fast and inorganically it almost feels like two films brought together.If I sound critical, the positive begins here. I really enjoyed the revamped music, the shaky camera views, and the few twists on things. The very way Micheal's grimacing stares penetrate the hope in the victims, in my opinion, shows how terrifying deranged he's become. Standing taller then most combined with his physical strength well beyond normal human exertion he is quite the killer. This is a man who has remained mute for years, losing all sense of moral, filled with rage from childhood issues with a unthoroughly psychopathic nature. Never would he admit to his wrong doings. His blood lust slaying ways are basically encrypted as second nature by the half mark of the film. Gone is the child he once was.So really the film kaputs the mysterious entity many liked. In return we get a more indepth view. Although not as good as the original and lacking many of the qualities, it still isn't a bad movie. With a few nods here and there to the old film, some might enjoy it, but many may not like the forced feeling. So it boils down to a entertaining, intensified, slasher ride.

1102456,A2CMP5MS7GQ5OQ,B000VKL6Z2,Couch Potato Michael,"[3, 4]","After several poorly done and failed sequels, director Rob Zombie (Devil's Rejects) attempts a remake of the original 1978 John Carpenter film, ""Halloween."" Veteran actor Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange) is somewhat a disappointment as Dr. Loomis, formally played by now deceased actor Donald Pleasence. Relatively newcomer Daeg Faerch makes an interesting young psycho crazed Michael Myers with the exception he is far too old for the role that was originally cast for a much younger actor. The greatest liberty in Zombie's film is that of Michael Myers lost but not forgotten sister, Laurie Strode. Zombie's  sequel paints Strode as a sexual, free thinking, rather loose, filthy mouth character, where John Carpenter saw Laurie Strode as a nave innocent good little girl, in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Zombie's Laurie Strode played by Scout Taylor Compton is completely ineffective in comparison to the 1978 version played by now veteran actress Jamie Lee Curtis. Zombie adds an occasional line or two from the original movie and keeps the bone chilling musical score written by John Carpenter, even though Zombie's film completely lacks the classical ""element of surprise"" which made October 1978 movie goers scream and jump 5 feet out of the seats. Zombie is dead to the fact Halloween is a cult classic that has endured. You just can't resurrect and completely alter beyond all recognition, a film loved by a cult following for 30 years. 90% of Hollywood remakes fail as dose Halloween 2007. Zombie would have done far better filling in missing gaps from the original and in hiring actors that were far most suited for their roles. I hope and pray Dimension Films will measure their lack of success of the Halloween sequels, miraculously overcome their dementia and put Michael Myers to bed once and for all. Maybe Dimension Films can allow Michael Myers to sleep for 100 years and wake him up to star in a remake of Rip Van Winkle. This would be perfect for me as in 100 years I won't be here to watch that film, thank God!  Most of all I hope Michael Myers is never transformed into a Zombie film again. Don't get me wrong, I like Zombie films for the gore blood and guts  B movies they are, but enough already. I thing Zombie should expand beyond his horizons as I do think him capable of a mainstream film. If I am wrong about Zombie's talents, I would recommend he spend the rest of his life getting a body piercing or more tattoos.

1102457,A364W6U6YL219D,B000VKL6Z2,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[3, 4]","Halloween (2007) Initially I was very disappointed to hear that the next movie from the Halloween franchise would be yet another ""reboot,"" or ""reimagining"" of the original movie rather than another sequel. I'm torn on this trend of remaking the classic horror films of my youth, initially finding most unnecessary. But at the same time, I came to realize that a set of British remakes of the Universal Studios Monsters movies of the 30's resulted in the Hammer Horror series nearly thirty years later, so there is some precedent of quality and worth. At the same time, I'm also one of the few people who will cut an eighth horror sequel some slack. Later I was a tiny bit less disappointed to hear that Rob Zombie had been chosen to write and direct the reboot as I have enjoyed his other movies to varying extents. Zombie's Halloween grounds Michael Myers in a horrible white trash upbringing, spending the first fifty minutes detailing why he descends into madness and murder. Part of that extra time is spent in Smith's Grove, giving more screen time to Dr. Loomis, now played by Malcolm McDowell. After that the story basically follows Carpenter's original with the almost feminine looking and tiny ten year old somehow growing to be 6'5'' Tyler Mane on institution food and becoming kind of a Terminator, bashing through walls to grab his victims instead of silently popping out at them from the dark. He pursues Laurie, Annie, and Linda through their worst October 31st ever, but also grabs several other victims every chance he gets, tripling the body count of the original Halloween. The supernatural dread Michael Myers originally had is muted by his grounded in reality origin all the way through the new movie's finale, a far cry from the sick fear you felt when Michael's body was no longer lying on the ground in front of the Wallace home. Weirdly, although I find this more realistic origin undermining to Michael Myer's ability to be fearsome, I find the movie's first 50 minutes more entertaining than the last hour, though the greasy long hair on everybody started to be annoying eventually. In fact, during the final chase between Michael and Laurie I grew bored, ready for the movie to just wrap it up. Overall, it is kinda fun to see how Zombie populates nearly every adult speaking part with a familiar genre face, but even that starts to grate when a lot of them are only on screen for a few seconds or don't even speak. As far as the negatives go, I dislike almost every bit of casting Zombie did on the younger cast, especially Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie. Jamie Lee Curtis was so good as Laurie in 1978, and this new actress pales so far in comparison. Her Laurie is actually unlikable, and most of the time I couldn't even tell her and Linda apart even with the glasses shtick. The only bright spot among the younger cast is Danielle Harris as Annie. Harris, a vet of Halloweens 4 and 5 is a bright spot here and completely pulls off being a high schooler even though the actress was around 30 at the time of the production. I was a little sad to see her do a nude scene this far into her career though. McDowell is probably the best choice you could make to play Loomis, but it was a mistake for him to avoid watching the original, because he never takes the character as far out as Donald Pleasance did which is who Loomis is. And it's not as if McDowell isn't capable of scenery chewing when he chooses. So, to put the final nail in this one, though there is a level of quality to this production and a few positive moments here and there, this remake is one of those unnecessary ones I mentioned.",2,A slasher directed by a Zombie!,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,3629,"['Halloween', '2007', 'Initially', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'hear', 'next', 'movie', 'Halloween', 'franchise', 'would', 'be', 'yet', 'reboot', 'reimagining', 'original', 'movie', 'rather', 'sequel', ""'m"", 'torn', 'trend', 'remaking', 'classic', 'horror', 'films', 'youth', 'initially', 'finding', 'most', 'unnecessary', 'same', 'time', 'came', 'realize', 'set', 'British', 'remakes', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Monsters', 'movies', '30', 'resulted', 'Hammer', 'Horror', 'series', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'precedent', 'quality', 'worth', 'same', 'time', ""'m"", 'also', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'cut', 'eighth', 'horror', 'sequel', 'slack', 'Later', 'was', 'tiny', 'bit', 'less', 'disappointed', 'hear', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'had', 'been', 'chosen', 'write', 'direct', 'reboot', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'movies', 'varying', 'extents', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'horrible', 'white', 'trash', 'upbringing', 'spending', 'first', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'detailing', 'why', 'madness', 'murder', 'Part', 'extra', 'time', 'spent', 'Smith', 'Grove', 'giving', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'now', 'played', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'story', 'basically', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'almost', 'feminine', 'looking', 'tiny', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'somehow', 'growing', 'be', '6', '5', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'institution', 'food', 'becoming', 'kind', 'Terminator', 'bashing', 'walls', 'grab', 'victims', 'instead', 'silently', 'popping', 'out', 'dark', 'Laurie', 'Annie', 'Linda', 'worst', 'October', '31st', 'ever', 'also', 'grabs', 'several', 'other', 'victims', 'chance', 'tripling', 'body', 'count', 'original', 'Halloween', 'supernatural', 'dread', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'originally', 'had', 'muted', 'grounded', 'reality', 'origin', 'way', 'new', 'movie', 'finale', 'far', 'cry', 'sick', 'fear', 'felt', 'when', 'Michael', 'body', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'lying', 'ground', 'front', 'Wallace', 'home', 'Weirdly', 'find', 'more', 'realistic', 'origin', 'undermining', 'Michael', 'Myer', 'ability', 'be', 'fearsome', 'find', 'movie', 'first', '50', 'minutes', 'more', 'entertaining', 'last', 'hour', 'greasy', 'long', 'hair', 'everybody', 'started', 'be', 'annoying', 'eventually', 'fact', 'final', 'chase', 'Michael', 'Laurie', 'grew', 'bored', 'ready', 'movie', 'just', 'wrap', 'up', 'Overall', 'kinda', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'Zombie', 'nearly', 'adult', 'speaking', 'part', 'familiar', 'genre', 'face', 'even', 'grate', 'when', 'lot', 'are', 'only', 'screen', 'few', 'seconds', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'As', 'far', 'negatives', 'go', 'dislike', 'almost', 'bit', 'casting', 'Zombie', 'did', 'younger', 'cast', 'especially', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'Laurie', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Laurie', '1978', 'new', 'actress', 'pales', 'so', 'far', 'comparison', 'Laurie', 'actually', 'unlikable', 'most', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'Linda', 'apart', 'even', 'glasses', 'shtick', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'younger', 'cast', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'Annie', 'Harris', 'vet', 'Halloweens', '4', '5', 'bright', 'spot', 'here', 'completely', 'pulls', 'off', 'being', 'high', 'schooler', 'even', 'actress', 'was', 'around', '30', 'time', 'production', 'was', 'little', 'sad', 'see', 'do', 'nude', 'scene', 'far', 'career', 'McDowell', 'probably', 'best', 'choice', 'could', 'make', 'play', 'Loomis', 'was', 'mistake', 'avoid', 'watching', 'original', 'never', 'character', 'far', 'out', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'did', 'who', 'Loomis', 'not', 'McDowell', ""n't"", 'capable', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'when', 'So', 'put', 'final', 'nail', 'one', 'level', 'quality', 'production', 'few', 'positive', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'remake', 'one', 'unnecessary', 'ones', 'mentioned']",Halloween
1102458,A26N27LJVQNVI1,B000VKL6Z2,crank,"[4, 5]","I like Rob Zombie. Met him a couple times and seems like a humble, normal person. I am not sure what all went wrong here. I think it is a tale of studios, trying new things, and a script that just wasn't very good. The killing in this film turns into weirdness at some point. At that time you also start picking apart the script. And then the house of cards starts falling down. The whole premise just has an aura of amateurish killing delight that the reality of it becomes more stupid the more you watch.We all know America and beyond is messed up and produces the worst of the worst. But when you give life to these stories you need to make them real. Part of the problem here is that everything just starts becoming a carnival and this isn't Devil's Rejects. That was a great film. Really, it was. This one isn't even half that film. Someday I guess I am supposed to watch a director's cut. Well, I almost walked out of the theater for this film it was so bad. So.... idk about that. But I think now that he is back to making his own films the quality has gotten much better again.The source material for this isn't exactly the greatest stuff in the world as far as realism or script goes. Well, imo, this film needed a healthy dose of realism to go along with its insane kill scenes. And it just doesn't have it here. Loomis and the like are just imbecilic in their roles and the way these guys go about trying to stop the killer is just absurd at this point. I couldn't get into this and believe a single moment even for a second and that is never good with horror in my opinion. I like subtle horror. If you are going to make a maniac and make him brutal then do it right. When you make this guy stupid, monster-like, and damn near sci-fi I just lose everything here I needed to like the film.It becomes a circus and one that is deplorable, violent, and empty inside. If this film was more subtle, had less kills scenes but them matter, and more realistic dialogue I might have cared. As is half-way through you just start realizing you are watching kill scene after kill scene with no real point.",1,Too many suits involved and too many amateur mistakes here.,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,2104,"['like', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Met', 'couple', 'times', 'humble', 'normal', 'person', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'here', 'think', 'tale', 'studios', 'trying', 'new', 'things', 'script', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'killing', 'film', 'weirdness', 'point', 'time', 'also', 'start', 'picking', 'apart', 'script', 'then', 'house', 'cards', 'starts', 'falling', 'down', 'whole', 'premise', 'just', 'aura', 'amateurish', 'killing', 'delight', 'reality', 'more', 'stupid', 'more', 'watch.We', 'know', 'America', 'messed', 'up', 'worst', 'worst', 'when', 'give', 'life', 'stories', 'need', 'make', 'real', 'Part', 'problem', 'here', 'everything', 'just', 'becoming', 'carnival', ""n't"", 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'Really', 'was', 'one', ""n't"", 'even', 'half', 'film', 'Someday', 'guess', 'am', 'supposed', 'watch', 'director', 'cut', 'Well', 'almost', 'walked', 'theater', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'So', 'idk', 'think', 'now', 'back', 'making', 'own', 'films', 'quality', 'gotten', 'much', 'better', 'again.The', 'source', 'material', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'greatest', 'stuff', 'world', 'as', 'far', 'realism', 'script', 'Well', 'imo', 'film', 'needed', 'healthy', 'dose', 'realism', 'go', 'along', 'insane', 'kill', 'scenes', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'here', 'Loomis', 'like', 'are', 'just', 'imbecilic', 'roles', 'way', 'guys', 'go', 'trying', 'stop', 'killer', 'just', 'absurd', 'point', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'believe', 'single', 'moment', 'even', 'second', 'never', 'good', 'horror', 'opinion', 'like', 'subtle', 'horror', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'maniac', 'make', 'brutal', 'then', 'do', 'right', 'When', 'make', 'guy', 'stupid', 'monster-like', 'damn', 'sci-fi', 'just', 'lose', 'everything', 'here', 'needed', 'film.It', 'circus', 'one', 'deplorable', 'violent', 'empty', 'inside', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'subtle', 'had', 'less', 'kills', 'scenes', 'matter', 'more', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'might', 'have', 'cared', 'half-way', 'just', 'start', 'realizing', 'are', 'watching', 'kill', 'scene', 'kill', 'scene', 'real', 'point']",Halloween

1102460,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B000VKL6Z2,C. Sawin,"[2, 3]","A few aspects of the film are actually quite good. Tyler Mane is a great Michael Myers. He's almost seven feet tall and is built like a giant. He's a total monster and the destruction and mayhem he causes is believable given his size. The adult version of Michael Myers is spot-on for a re-imagining of the film. Malcolm McDowell also does a good job as Dr. Loomis. He's no Donald Pleasance, but McDowell's take on the character isn't bad. Scout Taylor-Compton is also a worthy mention. She slips into the shoes of a modern day Laurie Strode rather flawlessly. Moving on from the acting though, the film is pretty solid from the time Michael gets his iconic mask through the finale. The way Michael made so many masks while he was in Smith's Grove was an interesting idea and the scene where you see his room fifteen years later with nothing but masks on every wall is one of the best in the film. The cinematography is also something that is often overlooked, which is a shame since it's actually pretty exceptional. It seemed to stand out most during the scenes where Michael was stalking Laurie, especially in the abandoned Myers house at the end. There's a scene right after Michael gets out of Smith's Grove where he goes to a truck stop and winds up getting the jumpsuit we're all familiar with. While there, he runs into Big Joe Grizzly in the bathroom stall and is banging Grizzly's hand, which is holding a knife, against the bathroom stall wall. As he's doing this though, the bathroom stall is just getting demolished but with every smashing blow, the camera violently shakes. The camera just always seemed to have a knack for giving a good perspective of what the character was going through, whether it was Michael or Laurie.The disappointing part of this is pretty much everything leading up to Michael getting his mask back after his escape is pretty terrible. The dialogue, especially in the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film, is horrendous. Everything that's said between Deborah Myers and Ronnie White is just awful. The white trash upbringing just doesn't seem worthy for a horror icon like Michael Myers. It's just hard to believe that Michael Myers is the way he is because his mom was a stripper and his older sister was a whore. Logic seems to just be thrown by the way side as the film progresses. After Michael escapes from Smith's Grove, he returns to his old house where his mask and knife that he used to kill his family happen to just be lying under the floorboards. So did the police just pick up the bodies without searching the house or what? So he got his jumpsuit by stealing it from a guy taking a dump at a truck stop? Really? Hearing some of the original music return from John Carpenter's version of the film was a bit bittersweet. On one hand, it was great hearing it again. On the other, however, it just didn't seem to fit. Made me miss the original film more than anything. Giving Michael Myers a specific origin was probably Zombie's biggest mistake. The most terrifying thing about Michael Myers was that he was The Shape and had a bit of mystery to him. You knew he was going after Laurie, but other than that you had Loomis' word to fall back on. Michael was the human incarnation of pure evil. That's it. That's all you need. Humanizing the character and introducing us to his childhood only watered down the Michael Myers character.There's a scene with Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis in Smith's Grove Sanitarium where Michael has made a mask that he's colored completely black. When Loomis asks him why it's black, Michael says that it's his favorite color. Loomis goes into an explanation about the color spectrum. Black is on one end and is the absence of color while white is at the opposite end and is every color. That's actually a great explanation of the differences between the original film and the remake. The original film would be the black segment of the spectrum. Carpenter's version leaves more to the viewer's imagination as the only explanation for Michael Myers is that he is ""pure evil."" While the remake would be the white segment of the spectrum as it goes into full detail why Michael Myers is the way he is and it shows every little violent and vulgar detail. Some people would say that having a little bit of mystery would be a good thing when it comes to a film like this while others like having everything laid out for them. It all depends on the viewer and which end of the spectrum they prefer. In my opinion though, that's the biggest mistake Rob Zombie made. There's no mystery left with the Michael Myers character. He's no longer The Shape, but is a psychopathic killer because he was raised by a white trash family, liked to torture animals, and whose sister didn't take him trick or treating.",2,An interesting take on a classic that falls flat,1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,4780,"['few', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'great', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'almost', 'seven', 'feet', 'tall', 'built', 'giant', 'total', 'monster', 'destruction', 'mayhem', 'believable', 'given', 'size', 'adult', 'version', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'spot-on', 're-imagining', 'film', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'McDowell', 'take', 'character', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Taylor-Compton', 'also', 'worthy', 'mention', 'shoes', 'modern', 'day', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'rather', 'flawlessly', 'Moving', 'acting', 'film', 'pretty', 'solid', 'time', 'Michael', 'iconic', 'mask', 'finale', 'way', 'Michael', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'masks', 'was', 'Smith', 'Grove', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'room', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'nothing', 'masks', 'wall', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'cinematography', 'also', 'something', 'often', 'overlooked', 'shame', 'actually', 'pretty', 'exceptional', 'seemed', 'stand', 'out', 'most', 'scenes', 'where', 'Michael', 'was', 'stalking', 'Laurie', 'especially', 'abandoned', 'Myers', 'house', 'end', 'scene', 'right', 'Michael', 'Smith', 'Grove', 'where', 'truck', 'stop', 'up', 'getting', 'jumpsuit', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'there', 'Big', 'Joe', 'Grizzly', 'bathroom', 'stall', 'banging', 'Grizzly', 'hand', 'holding', 'knife', 'bathroom', 'stall', 'wall', 'doing', 'though', 'bathroom', 'stall', 'just', 'getting', 'demolished', 'smashing', 'blow', 'camera', 'violently', 'camera', 'just', 'always', 'seemed', 'have', 'knack', 'giving', 'good', 'perspective', 'what', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'Michael', 'Laurie.The', 'disappointing', 'part', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'leading', 'up', 'Michael', 'getting', 'mask', 'back', 'escape', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'first', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'horrendous', 'Everything', 'said', 'Deborah', 'Myers', 'Ronnie', 'White', 'just', 'awful', 'white', 'trash', 'upbringing', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'worthy', 'horror', 'icon', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'just', 'hard', 'believe', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'way', 'mom', 'was', 'stripper', 'older', 'sister', 'was', 'whore', 'Logic', 'just', 'be', 'thrown', 'way', 'side', 'film', 'progresses', 'Michael', 'escapes', 'Smith', 'Grove', 'old', 'house', 'where', 'mask', 'knife', 'used', 'kill', 'family', 'happen', 'just', 'be', 'lying', 'floorboards', 'So', 'did', 'police', 'just', 'pick', 'up', 'bodies', 'searching', 'house', 'what', 'So', 'got', 'jumpsuit', 'stealing', 'guy', 'taking', 'dump', 'truck', 'stop', 'Really', 'Hearing', 'original', 'music', 'return', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'bittersweet', 'one', 'hand', 'was', 'great', 'hearing', 'again', 'other', 'however', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'Made', 'miss', 'original', 'film', 'more', 'anything', 'Giving', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'specific', 'origin', 'was', 'probably', 'Zombie', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'most', 'terrifying', 'thing', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'was', 'was', 'Shape', 'had', 'bit', 'mystery', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'Laurie', 'other', 'had', 'Loomis', 'word', 'fall', 'back', 'Michael', 'was', 'human', 'incarnation', 'pure', 'evil', 'need', 'Humanizing', 'character', 'introducing', 'childhood', 'only', 'watered', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'scene', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Smith', 'Grove', 'Sanitarium', 'where', 'Michael', 'made', 'mask', 'colored', 'completely', 'black', 'When', 'Loomis', 'why', 'black', 'Michael', 'favorite', 'color', 'Loomis', 'explanation', 'color', 'spectrum', 'Black', 'one', 'end', 'absence', 'color', 'white', 'opposite', 'end', 'color', 'actually', 'great', 'explanation', 'differences', 'original', 'film', 'remake', 'original', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'black', 'segment', 'spectrum', 'Carpenter', 'version', 'more', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'only', 'explanation', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'pure', 'evil', 'remake', 'would', 'be', 'white', 'segment', 'spectrum', 'full', 'detail', 'why', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'way', 'little', 'violent', 'vulgar', 'detail', 'people', 'would', 'say', 'having', 'little', 'bit', 'mystery', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'film', 'others', 'having', 'everything', 'laid', 'out', 'viewer', 'end', 'spectrum', 'prefer', 'opinion', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'made', 'mystery', 'left', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'character', 'no', 'longer', 'Shape', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'was', 'raised', 'white', 'trash', 'family', 'liked', 'torture', 'animals', 'sister', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'trick', 'treating']",Halloween
1102461,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000VKL6Z2,Cubist,"[50, 65]","Remaking a classic horror film is almost never a good idea.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,Dawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)andThe Hitcher (Widescreen Edition)are examples of recent remakes that are inferior shadows of their original selves. And so it came with great disappointment when it was announced that John Carpenter'sHalloween (Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition)was going to be remade and Rob Zombie would direct. Known mostly for his music with White Zombie and a successful solo career, he's branched out into making films, includingThe Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition), a down `n' dirty homage to outlaw cinema of the 1970s. Why would a self-professed horror film buff like Zombie even try to remake a revered classic like Halloween? Hubris? Fanboy wish fulfillment? Or, did he figure that this film was going to be made one way or another and rather than let some hack do a crappy job; he could at least bring his stylistic touches and point-of-view to the table.Zombie's remake works because he takes the Halloween mythos and expands it in all kinds of fascinating ways. He makes some really intriguing choices like not making Michael supernaturally strong but rather a big guy who is naturally tough and strong. Zombie also opts for gritty realism like he did with The Devil's Rejects and it is a smart choice that works. Whether you love or hate his take on the material, you have to admit that it doesn't resemble Carpenter's film in any way. It is easily the best Halloween film since Part III, although that isn't really saying much when you consider the quality of the subsequent sequels.The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Rob Zombie. He points out the various locations they shot in while also drawing our attention to where he took footage out and why. Zombie spends a lot of time talking about the challenges he faced on certain scenes. He also points out the new footage in this cut and why he put it back. The filmmaker delivers another solid commentary that is well worth a listen if you're a fan of this film.The second disc starts of with 17 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Zombie. Unlike some auteurs, he is refreshingly ruthless with his footage and so we have a lot of scenes that were cut, including more of the strip club where Michael's mom works. There's also more of Loomis talking to a young Michael. Michael also attends a parole hearing that features a character played Tom Towles. Adrienne Barbeau even shows up briefly in a scene with Loomis. Zombie does a good job explaining why these scenes were cut.Also included is an ""Alternate Ending"" with optional commentary by Zombie. This one is more sympathetic to Michael but wasn't satisfying enough for the director and he went with the other ending which is much more visceral.""Bloopers"" features footage of McDowell cracking up with Sheri Moon Zombie take after take. It turns out that the veteran actor is a real goofball and looks like he's having a blast making his fellow actors laugh.""The Many Masks of Michael Myers"" takes a look at how they constructed the iconic Michael Myers mask. They created several versions, including clean ones and then gradually grungy ones to symbolize the passage of time. We also see how the put together the various ones that Michael makes in the sanitarium.""Re-Imagining Halloween"" is a three-part look at various aspects of the making of the film. Zombie wanted to shoot it in the style of 21 Grams and The Constant Gardener. He wanted the three acts to have their own distinctive looks: the first part was all hand-held cameras, the second was very static, and the third act used lots of steadicam work. The film's production design is examined. They take a look at the various sets and briefly talk about the specific look Zombie was after. The makeup effects are also featured. This involved a lot of work as Michael kills a lot of people. Zombie wanted them to look realistic and we see how some of the kills were done.""Meet the Cast."" Zombie says that the casting process is the most exciting part of the filmmaking process for him because it is the first time the film feels real. He talks about why he cast the actors that he did and, in turn, they talk about their approach to the characters and a bit about working on the film.""Casting Sessions"" is a collection of excerpts of audition footage of the cast members. It gives us a chance to see what convinced Zombie to hire them.""Scout Taylor-Compton Screen Test"" features more footage of this young actress testing for the role of Laurie Strode. It is easy to see why she was cast as she nails the role.Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",5,Unrated Director's Cut Loaded with Tons of Good Extras!,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,4696,"['Remaking', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'almost', 'never', 'good', 'idea.The', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Widescreen', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', 'andThe', 'Hitcher', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'are', 'examples', 'recent', 'remakes', 'are', 'inferior', 'shadows', 'original', 'selves', 'came', 'great', 'disappointment', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'John', ""Carpenter'sHalloween"", 'Divimax', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'remade', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'would', 'direct', 'Known', 'mostly', 'music', 'White', 'Zombie', 'successful', 'solo', 'career', 'branched', 'out', 'making', 'films', 'includingThe', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'down', 'n', 'dirty', 'homage', 'outlaw', 'cinema', '1970s', 'Why', 'would', 'self-professed', 'horror', 'film', 'buff', 'Zombie', 'even', 'try', 'remake', 'revered', 'classic', 'Halloween', 'Hubris', 'Fanboy', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'did', 'figure', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'one', 'way', 'rather', 'let', 'hack', 'do', 'crappy', 'job', 'could', 'least', 'bring', 'stylistic', 'touches', 'point-of-view', 'table.Zombie', 'remake', 'works', 'Halloween', 'mythos', 'kinds', 'fascinating', 'ways', 'really', 'intriguing', 'choices', 'not', 'making', 'Michael', 'supernaturally', 'strong', 'rather', 'big', 'guy', 'who', 'naturally', 'tough', 'strong', 'Zombie', 'also', 'gritty', 'realism', 'did', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'smart', 'choice', 'Whether', 'love', 'hate', 'take', 'material', 'have', 'admit', ""n't"", 'resemble', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'way', 'easily', 'best', 'Halloween', 'film', 'Part', 'III', ""n't"", 'really', 'saying', 'much', 'when', 'consider', 'quality', 'subsequent', 'sequels.The', 'first', 'features', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'out', 'various', 'locations', 'shot', 'while', 'also', 'drawing', 'attention', 'where', 'took', 'footage', 'out', 'why', 'Zombie', 'lot', 'time', 'talking', 'challenges', 'faced', 'certain', 'scenes', 'also', 'out', 'new', 'footage', 'cut', 'why', 'put', 'back', 'filmmaker', 'solid', 'commentary', 'well', 'listen', ""'re"", 'fan', 'film.The', 'second', 'disc', 'starts', '17', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Zombie', 'auteurs', 'refreshingly', 'ruthless', 'footage', 'so', 'have', 'lot', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'including', 'more', 'strip', 'club', 'where', 'Michael', 'mom', 'also', 'more', 'Loomis', 'talking', 'young', 'Michael', 'Michael', 'also', 'parole', 'hearing', 'character', 'played', 'Tom', 'Towles', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'even', 'up', 'briefly', 'scene', 'Loomis', 'Zombie', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'why', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut.Also', 'included', 'Alternate', 'Ending', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Zombie', 'one', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Michael', 'was', ""n't"", 'satisfying', 'enough', 'director', 'went', 'other', 'ending', 'much', 'more', 'visceral', 'Bloopers', 'features', 'footage', 'McDowell', 'cracking', 'up', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'take', 'take', 'out', 'veteran', 'actor', 'real', 'goofball', 'having', 'blast', 'making', 'fellow', 'actors', 'laugh', 'Many', 'Masks', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'look', 'how', 'constructed', 'iconic', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'mask', 'created', 'several', 'versions', 'including', 'clean', 'ones', 'then', 'gradually', 'grungy', 'ones', 'symbolize', 'passage', 'time', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'put', 'together', 'various', 'ones', 'Michael', 'sanitarium', 'Re-Imagining', 'Halloween', 'three-part', 'look', 'various', 'aspects', 'making', 'film', 'Zombie', 'wanted', 'shoot', 'style', '21', 'Grams', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'wanted', 'three', 'acts', 'have', 'own', 'distinctive', 'looks', 'first', 'part', 'was', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'second', 'was', 'very', 'static', 'third', 'act', 'used', 'lots', 'steadicam', 'work', 'film', 'production', 'design', 'examined', 'take', 'look', 'various', 'sets', 'briefly', 'talk', 'specific', 'look', 'Zombie', 'was', 'makeup', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'featured', 'involved', 'lot', 'work', 'Michael', 'lot', 'people', 'Zombie', 'wanted', 'look', 'realistic', 'see', 'how', 'kills', 'were', 'done', 'Meet', 'Cast', 'Zombie', 'casting', 'process', 'most', 'exciting', 'part', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'feels', 'real', 'about', 'why', 'cast', 'actors', 'did', 'turn', 'talk', 'approach', 'characters', 'bit', 'working', 'film', 'Casting', 'Sessions', 'collection', 'excerpts', 'audition', 'footage', 'cast', 'members', 'chance', 'see', 'what', 'convinced', 'Zombie', 'hire', 'Taylor-Compton', 'Screen', 'Test', 'more', 'footage', 'young', 'actress', 'testing', 'role', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'cast', 'role.Finally', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",Halloween

1102466,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000VKL6Z2,Dave. K,"[3, 4]","This review is on the long side, but please just bare with me.Halloween just might be the most controversial horror remake of all time; when it was announced as a remake with Rob Zombie directing a lot of people were for it and a lot of people were against it. While I wasn't happy Halloween was being remade I also looked forward to it. I feel the last couple of installments were rather weak. Even though I do enjoy 2-5, it's all been downhill after the classic original. Also being a fan of Rob Zombie got me interested.The series though needed something to get back on track and I hoped this would be the movie to get things going. I know a lot of people were upset that the series wouldn't get closure now. But does it really matter? This series has so many loose ends to begin with. The unfairly bashed Halloween 3 has nothing to do with the previous 2 or anything afterwards so that will never be wrapped up. Halloween 4-6 were ignored come H20 and Resurrection. So no matter what this series would never get closure. And honestly after Halloween: Resurrection this franchise was in much need of a resurrection.Adding a back-story is something that can be very tough to work and that is what really made me nervous and when I heard it was the first half of the movie I got even more nervous. This may be a remake, but let's face it most people will still see this as the 9th Halloween movie. The funny thing is I happen to think the first half was the strongest of the movie and I know a lot of people felt that way. Even those who hated the movie, a lot of the times say the first half was better. The backstory here is far, far better than the lame curse of thorn. The first half was an interesting character study of a very disturbed boy.The screenplay by Rob Zombie was very uneven; most of his ideas play out well, but there are some cringe worthy moments. The first 10-minutes or so features some weak writing. But as a fan of this genre the writing is often the weakest part and none of the Halloween movies had great screenplays. Yes even the original; the script really wasn't all that great. The reason Halloween is the masterpiece it is, is simply because of the strong lead performances and Carpenter's directing and music. In Halloween 07 most of the poor dialogue is from Ronnie White played by the very cool William Forsythe. His dialogue is terrible and his performance is border-line of a parody. His character is entertaining, but the biggest flaw with the first half. But the good is any scene with Dr. Loomis played by Malcolm McDowell and young Michael played by Daeg Faerch. Also the scenes withy young Michael and Deborah Myers played by Sheri Moon Zombie also works very well.The Loomis and Michael scenes actually come out well, and it was quite interesting to see Loomis actually trying to reach Michael and help him. In the original we never see Loomis working with young Michael, which is fine. That wasn't the point of the original, but it is interesting seeing Loomis trying to reach Michael. I found their relationship the strongest part of Halloween 07. In the original as well as the sequels Loomis is out to stop Michael no matter what. Even if it means giving his own life; when Loomis first comes across Michael at the end in the original his first reaction was shoot to kill. In Halloween 07 Loomis though tries to reach Michael first and if that doesn't work than shoot to kill. The scenes with Loomis and Michael are well written and acted and play out very well overall. Daeg Faerch does an excellent job as young Michael.Some people dislike the backstory, but it was for the most part well done some people disliked the fact Michael was given a motive. I don't think that was the case. Michael was a disturbed boy who was bound to snap sooner or later. His home life just made him snap sooner. But the things he does as a child and later as an adult isn't something people do unless they are very disturbed.The first half actually works well despite some weak writing at times; the performances were mostly good with Sheri Moon Zombie being the stand-out; I do think Zombie has a slight problem writing for normal characters, but he does a great job with Deborah Myers. She was likeable and very sympathetic. I do think though the screenplay could have used a touch up in the first half, but Zombie keeps the pace moving at a solid pace and makes up for any shortcomings.The problem with the 2nd half is basically 80-minutes of the original crammed into about an hour. The pacing is the biggest problem; characters are introduced for a scene or two and are killed off right away. There is very little getting to know them. There are moments where it does sort of become a rehash of the original, but it still works well. No doubt it's not as suspenseful and scary as the original, but Zombie's scenes do work well overall.With Halloween, the problem of writing for normal characters is still there for Zombie. None of the characters were really all that likeable outside of maybe Ismael Cruz played by Danny Trejo. The Strode family was Rob's attempt at writing normal characters, but the problem is they come across as really weird. It's like those people who get older, but yet try and act like they are down with the youth they always seem weird. Pat Skipper does a good job as Mason Strode as does Dee Wallace as Cynthia. Both characters are likeable though, but just come across as a little weird. Their deaths though are very brutal and work really well.Scout Taylor-Compton does an excellent job as Laurie Strode, but her character was just not fully developed, but than again the point of Halloween 07 was to focus more on Michael Myers. It was his story where as the original was Laurie's story. Scout gets some heat, but she was one of the bright spots of the movie. Some people say she wasn't likeable and was too mean to Tommy Doyal played by Skyler Gisondo. I have to disagree; the scenes with her and Tommy and than later with Lindsey played by Jenny Gregg Stewart are the strongest scenes in the 2nd half. She wasn't being mean to them they have brother/sister kind of relationship and it worked quite well. Zombie is getting better at writing for normal characters. His first two were all about the villains, and here the main focus is the villain, but he does do better with the normal characters, than he did in Corpses and Rejects. But The Devil's Rejects is still by far his best movie thus far.By the time Laurie enters the movie there is about an hour left and there was no way all these characters plus Laurie could be fully developed without slowing down the pace. This Laurie isn't the repressed virgin Jamie Lee's Laurie was. Scout's Laurie was a nice girl with an edge to her. But her first scene was very weird and that shows Zombie needs more work on normal characters. By the time Laurie came into play developing her too much would have slowed the pace down a lot. And at this point you gotta keep moving forward. There was potential with the Laurie character, but despite not being fully developed I do think the character was likeable.Some people complain about the lack of screen time for Lynda played by Kristina Klebe and Annie played by Danielle Harris making her big return to the Halloween series. If you go back and view the original Halloween, Lynda actually doesn't have a lot of screen time. Difference is her part is spread out more through the picture, where as here it's not. Though it does seem like Annie may have had less screen time than the original Annie did; both girls though play their roles well. They weren't all that likeable in general, but they both provide solid performances.I think the writing for Laurie, Lynda and Annie was good and bad. They do come across like teenagers in the things they say and do. Not all teens are like that, but a lot of them are. But they just lacked depth. But as much as I love the original there was some weak writing and Lynda had the weakest of lines. Lynda in the remake is no more developed, but in some ways she actually is. Prior to her death when she talks to Laurie on the phone does add a little bit of depth to Lynda. Her tough girl act is just that an act. Zombie's screenplay was very mixed, but there is some potential there for him as a writer with normal characters.Tyler Mane I thought did a great job as Michael Myers. To be honest I would rate him 2nd to only Nick Castle of the original. If the original Michael was the incarnation of evil, this Michael is the incarnation of rage. Despite his size he's still stealthy. The scene when he stands behind Lindsey Wallace as she watches TV is a very creepy moment. Tyler's Michael and Nick Castle's Michael are very much a like, but very different. But I really loved Tyler's performance.The good and bad of the backstory is simple. We get to know Michael so well it does sort of take away the boogeyman element. But it also brings a human side to Michael and makes him feel so much more real. I'll admit the 2nd half had some creepy moments thanks to Tyler's movements and the fact we knew Michael more makes him seem real. In the sequels he became too much of an un-killable monster. Like the original, this is the most human Michael has ever been. In the original Michael was just pure evil, he was the shape of evil in a man. But he felt like a real person. And while he kept coming back an excuse can be made for why he survived what he did. Zombie goes back to that in a sense. Again this is the most human Michael has been in a while.What I liked about Tyler Mane was his eyes show nothing. And what I mean by that they show no remorse. He has this empty look. The person inside of him is dead and just evil has taken over his body. Having such a big Michael may not have been the smartest move, but it works out great as Tyler Mane gives it his all and makes a great Michael. Malcolm McDowell was excellent as Dr. Loomis, though nobody can ever top Pleasence. My only problem with McDowell is sometimes he comes across as a bit shady. The major problem is a lot of his scenes in the 2nd half with Brad Dourif as Sheriff Brackett is a rehash of the original just worded slightly different.Some people complain about the violence, but I thought it was done in a great way. The one thing Rob Zombie really has going for him as a filmmaker is he knows how to shoot a brutal death scene. His love of exploitation cinema serves him well with the deaths. The victims try and fight back and put more of a struggle up. The scene with Michael dragging away a topless Annie is a very creepy moment. And when Laurie finds her later on it's actually quite chilling. This is probably the most violent Halloween, but it does work well since it's very raw and real. As a director despite some pacing problems Rob Zombie is able to keep things moving forward and like him or not there was a story and I personally enjoyed it.Not everybody will like this flick, but I can't help but feel a lot of the hate stems from it being a remake. I saw a lot of negative reviews from people who never even have seen this and I read a lot of negative stuff before the movie was even shot. Liking the remake doesn't make you any less of a fan of the original and Halloween 07 will never replace the original. I don't get that so many people are willing to accept the sequels, but dismiss the remake before even viewing it.Make no mistake Halloween 07 isn't a perfect film and not as good as the original. But it does deliver some suspense and scares. I would rate Halloween 07 as the 2nd best of the series only behind the original. I didn't like Halloween 07 at first, but now I've come to love it. Give it a chance and just forget it's a remake and enjoy the ride.",4,Rob Zombie's Halloween has more going for it than you may think,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,11750,"['review', 'long', 'side',

This prequel/re-imaging had one fantastic scene during the first 10 minutes, and then it just fell apart and was exposed for the train wreck die hard Halloween fans were certain it would be.Michael myers now comes from a white trash family complete with an abusive pedophile stepfather. His sister a trash talking whore.(the whole family is trash talking) A pole dancing mother who was actuallyredeemable(somewhat) and played very well by Zombie's wife. Malcolm McDowell has none of the hypnotic effect that the late Donald Pleasance had as DR. Sam Loomis. The grown Myers is an incredible bulk with catchers mits as hands, and just lumbers his way through this. The second re-imaging half just moves along at a frantic pace with no suspense or atmosphere, and is hardly frightening in the least. Many parts were laughed at in the theatre I was in.Trying to remake a classic timeless masterpiece of filmaking is like trying to change the laws of physics, it can't be done, and could actually be quite dangerous if tried.

1102468,A3V5YEY65T37UL,B000VKL6Z2,David Butler,"[1, 5]","I have been a fan of the horror genre since I was young.  As a teenager, friends and I would sometimes pull all-night horror marathons and have a blast.  It was never the mindless slasher nonsense that drew us in, but the smart, well-crafted films with both suspense and true scares.  The list that meet these criteria is a short one, ranging from the original Exorcist from 1973 to modern classics like Session 9 and even May.  Some of our most cherished, however, have been part of the Halloween series.John Carpenter's original Halloween and Rick Rosenthal's respectable sequel are both classic greats in the horror world.  Most of the sequels that followed were questionable at best.  And when something is done well, imitation is expected.  Countless film makers have tried to compete with the likes of Halloween or A Nightmare on Elm Street or Alien.  Naturally, almost none of the films these have inspired turned out to be memorable.  But then a terrible thing happened in 1998 that opened a door that never should have been opened.  They remade Psycho.  Those of you who watched Gus Van Sant's film know what it was.  It was a disgrace to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece as well as to audiences everywhere.  It was an attempt to bring the greatest psychological thriller in cinema history to a whole new generation.  And why did it fail so miserably?  Was it the director?  The actors?  The script (which was almost word-for-word the original)?  No.  It failed because you can't remake a classic.  That is precisely what makes them classics.When the previews for a Halloween remake directed by Rob Zombie came out, I was really excited.  Having bought both House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, I had a fair amount of faith in Zombie's ""new take on a classic legend.""  Zombie has proved to be a man willing and unafraid to push the limits in both music and movies far past what regular (read: boring) audiences are used to.  So I watched it.  I was intrigued.  I kept watching.  Pretty different alright, I thought.  But as the movie went on, and differences mounted, I began to feel a little discouraged.  Was I just watching another bad slasher movie?  The f-bomb was being used way to much, everyone the killer saw was being slaughtered, the nudity was needlessly excessive and the only suspense came from wondering when and if it would get better.  It didn't.  Rob Zombie pillaged Carpenter's legacy by turning a scary story into a run-of-the-mill piece of trash no different from the likes of Wrong Turn or Rest Stop.Trust me.  Trust me.  Rob Zombie is still cool and I will certainly not allow this one failure to keep me from checking out his next project.  I gave Halloween 2 stars instead of 1 because, hey, he tried.  But Beware.  This movie will disappoint anyone looking for more than just blood and guts.

1102469,ADKPBM8JL4SGY,B000VKL6Z2,"David Cummings ""Bill""","[1, 7]","I was really looking forward to this remake ever since I heard about it. Zombie directing a Halloween remake/prequel? Heck yeah! What did I get? A stereotypical ""tormented kid"" who likes to kill animals. On the day it is discovered that he kills animals (the day being Halloween doesn't seem to be any catalyst) he kills a kid from school, and then goes home to be further tormented by his scummy family. Then, when he finds he can't go trick or treating, he kills his sister, her boyfriend, and his stepdad (if in fact his mother married the guy). After the cops pick him up, Mikey (who is still talking) claims he can't remember the event. Yet slowly he starts wearing masks and withdrawing, until he kills a nurse at which point he becomes ""the shape"", by which I mean he shoots up to the 7-8 foot mark, and trades in his mass of body fat for toned muscle.It is here that we turn from the more reality based bad childhood, to the completely unrealistic Halloween portion. Honestly, what mental hospital would let a guy (especially one this physically scary) indulge in his obsession of mask-making? What guard would, after knowing what the guy did as a kid and obviously seeing the physical build, treat the guy in such a gentle manner? What about the physical build itself? Did they allow him to spend hours in a gym... with a trainer? Wouldn't they shave his hair? Completely unbelievable. The rest of the movie is just a rehash of the original, but without any tension, no compassion for the victims, and a spelling out that Laurie Strode is Mikey's sister... oh, and Dr. Loomis (who starts out as a bit of a beatnik, but then sells his story and seems to forget about Mikey until he escapes) is killed.I know what Zombie was trying to do (at least I think I do). He was trying to bring the Myers mythology into a ""real"" world situation, giving the kid a real (or at least clinical) reason to turn psycho. The problem is that we have seen that before. We've seen the innocent kid, ruined by his environment, turned into a monster. That's why the original has so much power... because we didn't know why. It gave the story a mystical quality. Why did he kill? What did he think inside his catatonic state for 15 years? How could he drive a car? Why doesn't he die? Zombie's version answers all these questions, but the answers are cheap. Easy answers like, ""Because he was abused."" Or having him NOT be catatonic, or NOT drive a car. That's even better, cause then there is no question. ""He doesn't die because he's really big."" It cheapens the whole idea of the movie. The only question that still remains is how does he know Laurie is his sister? (why even have the whole sister thing since this is suppossed to exist outside of all the other movies. we didn't even know Laurie was his sister until the sequal) This part is left unanswered, unless you say something like, ""Because their bond was THAT strong.""This honestly doesn't deserve the name of Halloween. This should have been called ""Mask"", advertised as yet another in the ""gritty and real"" horror movies, and then thrown in the pile with all those other nu-slashers (wolf creek, wrong turn, house of wax-the remake) and remembered only for being a mis-step in Zombie's filmography (hopefully).",2,Spoilers!!

1102470,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B000VKL6Z2,David Girod,"[1, 2]","When Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" first came out, despite my initial reaction to anyone trying to remake Carpenter's classic, I went to see it in the theater. I hated it! Outside of the soundtrack, I thought there was little to no value in Zombie's film.For lack of anything better to watch I decided to give the movie another shot. I have to say I was pleasently surprised. While I still hate the opening 5 - 10 minutes or so (I think Zombie was a bit ham handed  and over the top in making sure the viewer knew Michael came from a dysfunctional family), the rest of the film was pretty gripping and interesting.As the movie starts out, we are introduced to the Myers family. A family so dysfunctional they would have to go to therapy in order to move into a trailer park. Stripper Mom, Alcoholic and Abusive Step-Dad, Trampy older sister named Judy, Wierdo and bullied Michael and the baby Laurie. Some people didn't like that we got Michael's backstory, I was one of them initially, because it was bit creepier thinking that Mike came from a good home and just snapped like in the original. With Zombie's film we get to see what creates the hulking psychopath seen in the second half of the film. When Michael finally snaps and kills one of the bullies from his school, it starts the killing spree that will conclude on Halloween night 18 years later (or continues 18 years later once the sequel came out?).Institutionalized because of the murders, Michael meets Dr. Loomis, a psychiatrist that initially tries to help Michael, but later exploits him and his crimes. Michael spends most of his life locked away in a small room, hiding and wearing masks of his own design until one Halloween night he decides to go home and find his little sister.Very bloody, boob filled and violent as all get out, Zombie definately makes the story his own. Zombie's version of Michael Myers is similar to the classic portrayal of Jason Voorhees from the ""Friday the 13th"" films, an unstoppable hulking, silent killer. In the old ""Halloween"" films, Michael was the boogeyman that lurked and popped up out of the dark. If you go into this film hoping to see Michael lurking in the background, slowly sneaking up on his prey...you'll hate this movie.

1102471,AU48P2XZBUJ2Q,B000VKL6Z2,David Haas,"[4, 9]","John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" works brilliantly on so many levels.Rob Zombie's update has succeeded in mangling virtually every element, to the point that there isn't a single thing right in it.I'll first address those who rail against we who post negative critiques, saying that we just need an open mind and we need to be willing to see a new interpretation:Bull.I have no problem with new interpretations as a concept, but a classic of the genre, a film that is one of the pinnacles of suspense horror deserves a better turn that to be ""re-envisioned"" into this execrable waste.Let's start picking:The backstory - way, WAY too long, for starters.  I guess it's possible that it could have been more stereotypical and less intersting, but off hand I can't imagine how.  Okay, so we all now know that abusive and dysfunctional upbringing can lead to torture of small animals, which is a warning sign that the subject may tend towards homicidal tendencies as an adult.  Got it.  Thanks.  Do we really need to spend 60% of the film hashing this out?Plus, the grossest flaw of this backstory is that it belittles and de-mystifies the character of Michael Meyers entirely, not to mention that the terribly inappropriate casting of Tyler Mane doubles this damage.Why is he doing these things?  What drives his evil?  How is he so physically powerful for having the build of anybody else?  How the hell can he sit up and keep coming after having a knitting needle rammed into his throat?  According to the 1978 original, we'll never know, and that's why he's scary.`The Shape', the creepy guy in the overalls with the cheesy mask, could have been anybody.  He grew up in an apparently normal household, showed no signs of danger right up until he put the knife to his sister and her boyfriend.  As an adult, he's not physically remarkable in any way.  Just an average guy.  There is no reason or explanation for his murderous ways, he simply does it, and that's all that needs to be known.  And the fact that he doesn't seem remotely excited or amped up about doing what he's doing - he just does his thing.  He simply IS the Boogeyman.By showing us a kid who was almost engineered to be a psycho-killer, and having him grow up to be that huge, it's obvious that he's a juggernaut of mayhem.  Of course, a knitting needle to the throat isn't going to put him down, and it's a reasonable assumption that he'll take more bullets than any gun can carry before he'll start showing any effect.  The fact that he flies into violent rages diminishes him, too.  Of course, I'd be scared if that monster was coming at me.  I'd be scared if I was staked out on a railroad track with the daily freight bearing down on me - doesn't necessarily mean that it will make for good entertainment; nor does it mean that it's appropriate in a movie that should play up vaguely supernatural associations with the date of Halloween.Now let's compare the two renditions of Dr Loomis.Donald Pleasance's portrayal showed a man haunted by his failure as a psychologist, an otherwise brilliant man who just never could get through to this boy of pure evil, and that mark against him has clearly had an effect on his psyche.  Through this, though, there's still some humor left in him, as when he scares Lonny away from the house and grins to himself as the boy scampers off.Malcolm McDowell gives the depth of someone who's just read his lines for the first time just before the camera rolled.  I don't fault Mr McDowell for this, I fault the script and direction.  His Dr Loomis shows no real connection to anyone else in the film; he acts panicked at times, slightly brooding at others, but we never get the sense that he's anything other than just a guy who's known Michael since he was a boy, and has come to regard him as scary.  He's more like a pep coach, aware of the ghastly failure last time, but let's give it another go anyway, shall we?Another flaw the backstory brings to the table is this:  By the time we get to the modern day with the night of horrors the movie's supposed to be about, there's no time to give any kind of depth to any of the characters.  We don't care about them, we just want them to shut up and stop screaming.  Laurie elicits no sympathy as all her friends are dying around her, because we haven't gotten a chance to get to know her or anybody else.  By the time they're introduced, there's just enough time now for Michael to come to town and start slashing.The biggest flaw of all is the completely inept handling of what should be a masterpiece of suspense.  That's what the 1978 version was about - suspense and tension.  Rob Zombie has bludgeoned those ideas altogether, and his movie is just about brutality and gore.  Sure, that gets uncomfortable to watch after a while, but it's not scary.  It's not horror.  It's just watching unedited news reels of murder scenes.  This type of filmmaking works fine for ""House of 1,000 Corpses"", because the theme of god-awful brutality is what that movie's about.  But not ""Halloween"".  ""Halloween"" is supposed to be about terror, tension, suspense.Nothing in Rob Zombie's butchery is remotely scary.  The only reason I was getting tense is that I was hoping it would end soon.  There is no buildup, there is no development, there is only the cheap thrill of some over-the-top violence.  Prolonged shots of somebody screaming and bleeding are not scary.I enjoy his music, and ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" is a guilty pleasure movie I'll load up now and again, but I have never been so disappointed in a movie until this.  Especially considering what a comprehensive horror aficionado Rob is.I expected something much, much better.Bottom line:If the depth of your horror interests goes no further than the recent trend of torture-flicks like ""Hostel"" and ""Saw"", you'll probably dig this.  If something with some atmosphere and good acting is more your style, steer WAY clear of this turkey.",1,Wish I could give a rating of ZERO out of 5 stars,1194393600,"11 7, 2007",2007,5935,"['John',

1102472,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B000VKL6Z2,David J. Brown,"[3, 4]","THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE 3-DISC UNRATED DIRECTOR'S CUT ONLY!I'm a little late on this one.  I saw it with everyone else two years ago, and saw the unrated cut about a year ago.  I didn't loathe the film as much as the fanboy purists, but I also didn't love the film as much as the new fanboys who seem to like anything that was made within the last ten years.  To me this film is half original brilliance and half uninspired mediocrity.  Hence, the three star rating.  But the actual three disc set gets a five star rating, but I'll get to that in a minute.First off, the unrated director's cut is miles ahead and better then the cut shown theatrically.  We get more character beats, especially with Dr. Loomis and Michael's break-out scene is  done more realistically.  Zombie spends so much time making Michael a real human being in this film that it always boggled my mind how he escaped like Superman in the theatrical cut.  The director's cut not only uses incidents torn from the past's headlines, it seems more in step with the new tone and mythology of Zombie's Michael Myers.  We also get more time spent in the asylum with young Michael.  It's really well written and directed stuff that helps further drive Zombie's main thesis regarding Michael home, and it's truly creepy and unsettling.  For horro movie nerds we get a couple more detailed horror icon cameos in the form of Courtney Gains(Children of the Corn) and Udo Kier(Andy Warhol's Dracula, Modern Vampires) and Clint Howard(c'mon, you know this guy!).  Though, we lose the theatrical cut's cameos by Devil's Rejects allumni, my persoal favorite being Bill Mosley('Dog will hunt!)The problems with this remake vary.  Firstly, the opening breakfast scene is so over the top and silly that it's just annoying.  Obviously, Zombie had a loaded script and had to make a short cut in setting up this dysfunctional family, but it's not very believable or well done.  More importantly, Zombie takes some of the mythos and general mystery away from the Michael character by letting us get to know him and see that he was a regular kid with problems, major mental problems.  Unlike Carpenter's original where Michael was the personification of the unknown and faceless evil, Zombie just makes Michael your average American psycho.  It's interesting and unexpected but it is one of the factors that help in making the second half of the film not work.  I do appreciate the asylum scenes and I really like the relationship between young Michael and Loomis, played beautifully and tragically by Malcolm Mcdowell, leaving behind the kooky obsession of Donald Pleasance's Loomis.  The movie tries hard to make the viewer understand Michael and feel connected to him while being repulsed by what he is.  It's only half successful, and only in the first hour.After about forty-five minutes the film switches into a total remake of the Carpenter film proper.  Unfortunately, the film is so top heavy that we never really get to know or care about Michael's future victims including Laurie Strode, and this is big gripe for me. Not being able to care about the characters or even differentiate them from one another is death to a horror film.  Many slasher films from the mid to late 80's made the same mistake and just became exorcises in gore special effects. Kudos to Zombie for holding back on the gore though.  Sure, this movie is way gorier then the original but it's not that gorey in general.  The violence is more implied with body twitches, murky lighting, sound effects and unsettling music stings by the great composer Tyler Bates.  So, all the folks who saw this film and claimed it to be more violent then it is, are just giving Zombie the ultimate compliment as a director.  Hitchcock achieved the same thing with his shower scene in Psycho, though this film is also more violent then that film for sure.  Different times and different strokes I guess.While all the remake additions are interesting on their own right, the rushed and by the numbers remake section, the section with the real terror from the original, is slighted and less then desirable.  The finale is a great roller coaster ride, and I for one LOVE the final shot.  It was unexpected and leaves the audience unnerved for the future of the main character.  I don't think the film is a complete failure or terrible, but rather an underachiever with moments of originality and brilliance.  I would prefer Zombie to stick to original material then to remake ANYTHING.  I hold his Devil's Rejects in very high regard.  Maybe this summer's sequel Halloween 2, Zombie will perfect his original vision and not be shackled by following the original film's storyline.  Though, from the trailers I saw, Zombie's Halloween 2 seems to be set in a hospital.  NATCH.The three disc set is AWESOME!  If you loved this remake it's a no-brainer, but the third disc is worth a look even if you didn't.  Hell, if you're an aspiring filmmaker at all the third 4-hour making of disc is a must see.  Zombie does, like Peter Jackson, his own bonus materials for his films and chronicles the whole production.  This doc really shows the filmmaking process in it's entirety like none other I've seen in a long while.  One really gets an inside look at how these things are done, and not the usual B.S. EPK material most DVDs come with that end up really being a commercial for the film that has the actors saying empty things like, ""Yeah, it was a really fun shoot.  Everyone's great.""  You really get to see what a director's ultimate role in a film is, from every level.  There's a great bit involving the location scouting that shows Zombie making the tiniest of alterations to a set.  An alteration the viewer wouldn't think twice about but is on the director's mind at all times.  The second disc is the same as the previous releases as is the commentary.  A really good commentary that doesn't repeat too much of the info found on either bonus disc.  Not to mention Zombie goes into detail regarding his decision for this remake as far as the visuals, the violence, color scheme, and performances--which are all good despite some of the underwriting on some of the characters.Bottom line, this at least an interesting film, if not a great one.  I like it enough, while not being totally enamored of it.  I anticipate the sequel, and whether it's good or bad, I hope Zombie moves out of the remake business and gets back to making real films from his heart. Carpenter's Halloween is one of my favorite films of all time.  I hold it in high regard as far as horror cinema goes.  Carpenter himself is a filmmaker I use as a template for my own endeavors.  One thing that this remake tragically loses that the original had, and it was very important to the original, is that Michael was truly the boogeyman.  Some dialogue regarding the boogeyman, like the original, is peppered throughout the remake but it all seems moot considering how Zombie makes Michael so much more human.  He's not the boogeyman, he's a psycho with a motive only a psycho would understand or relate to.  The original Michael Myers was truly faceless and without motive, which made him scarier in his randomness, well until the original Halloween sequels screwed all that up.  This remake is no worse then the sequels, which were all mediocre in my opinion. Here's hoping for the future.",3,"""All the slashers from the 70's and 80's have returned with messed up childhoods""--David J.

1102474,A2QWXHB5IU8LCU,B000VKL6Z2,David W. George,"[4, 6]","While not perfect, Rob Zombie's take on 'Halloween' is unquestionably the most enjoyable entry in the long-running series since the 1978 original. That's probably because it pretty much is the original, with a few new twists, and a backstory which offers a look at the childhood of Michael Myers. As is the norm with a Rob Zombie film, it's also very gory and violent at times, but not when you compare it to his other directorial efforts, 'House Of 1,000 Corpses' and 'The Devil's Rejects'.Zombie's best decision in this ""re-imagining"" is to make Michael Myers vicious again. In too many of the inferior previous sequels, Myers is more like Frankenstein's monster, moving in slow motion. Here, he's far more energetic, and in one climactic scene, even runs at his intended victim. Tyler Mane, a former professional wrestler who played Sabretooth in the first 'X-Men' film, brings a physical presence in the role of Michael Myers; he's a towering menace. Zombie also uses most of his cast from his other two films, though the scene in the theatrical version in which most of them appear has been cut from this unrated version. Also, big kudos to Zombie for bringing Danielle Harris back into the fold, as she was the little girl in the fourth and fifth 'Halloween' sequels. She's all grown up now, and probably closer to 30 than the 18 year old she plays in the film, but she does just fine with the screen time she has. Finally, Scout Taylor-Compton has the daunting task of playing Laurie Strode, the role which made Jamie Lee Curtis famous all the way back in 1978. Taylor-Compton certainly is cute, but she can't quite pull off as convincing a performance on the same level as Curtis. Not that it's bad, but it's just not as memorable. Same goes for Malcolm McDowell, who steps into the big shoes of the late Donald Pleasence as Dr. Samuel Loomis.Nonetheless, this film is surprisingly much more fun than any prior installment, with the exception of the original. Actually, some of this film is an improvement on the classic 'Halloween', because Zombie is generally faithful to the source material, right down to the characters' names. Even the famous score by John Carpenter is well reproduced by Tyler Bates. This is Zombie's best effort so far, and while the conclusion of this 'Halloween' seems to indicate that it's the final go-round for Michael Myers, I'd be happy to have Zombie do another sequel, if he wanted to.Recommended, but be warned, some of the violence is brutal in this unrated version; opt for the theatrical version otherwise.",4,Enjoyable update on the original,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,2551,"['not', 'perfect', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'take', ""'Halloween"", 'unquestionably', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'entry', 'long-running', 'series', '1978', 'original', 'probably', 'pretty', 'much', 'original', 'few', 'new', 'twists', 'backstory', 'look', 'childhood', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'As', 'norm', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'gory', 'violent', 'times', 'not', 'when', 'compare', 'other', 'directorial', 'efforts', ""'House"", '1,000', 'Corpses', ""'The"", 'Devil', ""Rejects'.Zombie"", 'best', 'decision', 're-imagining', 'make', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'vicious', 'again', 'too', 'many', 'inferior', 'previous', 'sequels', 'Myers', 'more', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'moving', 'slow', 'motion', 'Here', 'far', 'more', 'energetic', 'one', 'climactic', 'scene', 'even', 'intended', 'victim', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'former', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'who', 'played', 'Sabretooth', 'first', 'X-Men', 'film', 'physical', 'presence', 'role', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'towering', 'menace', 'Zombie', 'also', 'most', 'cast', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'scene', 'theatrical', 'version', 'most', 'appear', 'been', 'cut', 'unrated', 'version', 'Also', 'big', 'kudos', 'Zombie', 'bringing', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'back', 'fold', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'fourth', 'fifth', ""'Halloween"", 'sequels', 'grown', 'up', 'now', 'probably', 'closer', '30', '18', 'year', 'old', 'film', 'just', 'fine', 'screen', 'time', 'Finally', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'daunting', 'task', 'playing', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'role', 'made', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'famous', 'way', 'back', '1978', 'Taylor-Compton', 'certainly', 'cute', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'convincing', 'performance', 'same', 'level', 'Curtis', 'Not', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'memorable', 'Same', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'who', 'big', 'shoes', 'late', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'Dr.', 'Samuel', 'Loomis.Nonetheless', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'prior', 'installment', 'exception', 'original', 'Actually', 'film', 'improvement', 'classic', ""'Halloween"", 'Zombie', 'generally', 'faithful', 'source', 'material', 'right', 'down', 'characters', 'names', 'Even', 'famous', 'score', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'well', 'reproduced', 'Tyler', 'Bates', 'Zombie', 'best', 'effort', 'so', 'far', 'conclusion', ""'Halloween"", 'indicate', 'final', 'go-round', 'Michael', 'Myers', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'have', 'Zombie', 'do', 'sequel', 'wanted', 'to.Recommended', 'be', 'warned', 'violence', 'brutal', 'unrated', 'version', 'theatrical', 'version', 'otherwise']",Halloween

1102476,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B000VKL6Z2,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[4, 4]","First off, I'm not sure this movie was worth four stars. It's more like 3.5, but considering that isn't an option, I'd rather give it half more than half less. Rob Zombie has made three movies in his career as a writer/director. The first was the cartoonishly over-the-top, ""sadistic"" (it wasn't) 'House of 1,000 Corpses', the highlight of which was Rainn Wilson as ""Fish Boy"". His second was 'The Devil's Rejects', an indirect sequel (meaning all it had in common was the same characters and actors) to 'House of 1,000 Corpses'. While 'Corpses' was more focused on being weird (the Dr. Satan underground climax; the apparently supernatural monsters), 'The Devil's Rejects' was focused on being an actual movie. The cartoonishness was gone, replaced by actually sadistic violence, likeable villains, and one of the most vile rape scenes but to film. Among all of that, it was a throwback to movies of the same genre from the 1970's. Zombie also directed one of the fake previews in the movie 'Grindhouse', though his, 'Werewold Women of the SS', was the second worst of the lot.I am in no way a horror fan. Usually all the movies are the same, and there hasn't been an actual good horror movie for several decades. But Zombie's movies are different than the normal ""gross before scary"" horror being released in droves every weekend. That's why it was such a dissapointment, to me at least, that, among other admirable qualities, his 'Halloween' remake has very few chills. It's almost a normal slice-'n-dice horror movie, complete with naked women running around getting fileted for most of the third act.The first two acts, both of which seriously deviate from the original 1978 classic, gives a back story on serial killer Michael Myers, which seriously deafens the impact of most of the terror later in the movie, the terror that was so present in the original. The biggest mistake was giving the killer a motive. Part of why the original was so scary was that it was just some crazy guy killing innocent teens. But here, in this one, the killer is made out to be a victim. His mother was a stripper, his father an angry ""cripple"", and his sister a promiscuous, careless teenager. The first act is spent almost entirely at the Myers' house, leading up to the massacre. Some of this is entertaining, such as Michael's mother (Sherri Moon Zombie, wife of the director), and Michael's father (William Forsythe) go-around in the opening minutes, mostly because of the incessent profanity. The rest, though, even the murders, are suprisingly boring and feel like there was nothing put into them.The second act of the movie focuses on Michael in the sanitarium, under the watch of Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, in a role originated by Donal Pleasence in the original). Most of this segment, again, takes place in one location: the mental hospital. Michael's mother, the only one to escape the massacre, comes to visit him once a week, and alot of screen time is given to Moon-Zombie and her depression over loosing her entire family. In a nice detail, she looks much older and worse-for-the-wear in the second act than she did in the first. This act culminates in another massacre, and Myers' subsequent escape from the hospital.The third act is spent in Haddonfield, Illinois, the setting of the original. There are the three girls, Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton), Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris), and Lindsey Wallace (Jenny Gregg Stewart), just like in the original. There are the two kids, babysat by Compton and Harris, and there are the two respective boyfriends of Harris and Stewart. This segment of the movie, by far the shortest, is, ironically, the one that feels the longest. This is mainly due to the fact that it's basically a condensed version of the original. The four teens are killed off in the beginning of the segment, and the rest is the police and Loomis trying to get to Myers before he has a chance to kill Laurie, and chase scene between Myers and Laurie that, although long, is uninteresting. The only truly disturbing scene in the entire movie is Harris' death.It's obvious that Zombie tried something different with his version of the movie, but it doesn't work out in his favor. Instead of the brisk pace and character development of 'The Devil's Rejects', Zombie goes overboard with blood and gore, of which the original had none. I know there was never a chance of this, but it would have been a great idea to cut out the prologue and go with the structure of the original, including leaving it bloodless. Again, I know there was never a chance of that, but it would have been interesting and, obviously, different from the norm. Ending on a positive note, Sherri Moon Zombie has to be the most attractive actress around, next to Katherine Heigl.Runtime: 109 Minutes.Rating: R, for strong brutal bloody violence and terror

I do find it interesting to examine the life of Michael Myers as a child and expand on that brief part in the original film though the idea of it as even close to a ""case study"" is ridiculous.

1102485,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B000VKL6Z2,Dr. E,"[14, 32]","... it has to sting when another director ""kills"" your crowning achievement.Here's the thing: I had actually read the horrendous critical reviews of Zombie's film and thought, ""When have critics ever understood horror?"" So, in a weird way, I guess I have only myself to blame ...As someone who teaches horror-film theory and horror-film studies, I know what will endure the ages and what will not. Still, I'm not some jaded academic. I love horror ... the more (figuratively) visceral, the better. Carpenter'sHalloween(1978) is well-respected by film scholars (even the snobbiest!) for a reason: it manages to inspire terror with little on-screen bloodshed ... much like Hooper'sThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre(1974).  Neither of these works necessitate a remake. And, while Nispel's 2003 revisit of ""TCM"" elicited tension and revulsion (both good), Zombie's ""Halloween"" only elicited anger.Foremost, the film is technically unpolished. At one point, the viewer becomes convinced that Loomis (McDowell) is responsible for Myers's adult outbursts. In early therapy sessions, Loomis and Myers both wear black ... it becomes the topic of their conversation. It draws a parallel between the two. Then, Loomis pens an account of his experience with Myers and begins a book-tour. The scene opens with a projection of Myers' face ... and as Loomis utters ""Behind these eyes one finds only blackness, they absence of light, these are of a psychopath"" the camera moves to an extreme close-up of Loomis' eyes. So for the entire film, the viewer waits for the ""other shoe to drop"" ... for Loomis to confess some (perhaps ""unconscious"") involvement in Myers' now silent rage. But this never happens ... so one is led to ask, why create these parallels and then fail to complete the message? At best, we may discover the connection in the director's cut ... at worst, it was a really unforgivable error in filming.The casting of Myers is horrendous. Why make him physically monstrous? Carpender's original casting of Nick Castle was clever (tall but muscular), Zombie's casting of WWF/WCW wrestler Tyler Mane (6'8 and grotesquely built) was all too literal. Carpender's Myers terrifies audiences without having to appear physically extraordinary ... he is ""The Shape"" (for those in the know) ... not ""The Lumbering Blob.""Moreover, by providing one of the most wretched back-stories I have ever witnessed, Zombie destroys Carpenter's most gruesome message ... some people are born evil. This is why Donner'sThe Omen(1976) was so gripping. Damien was born evil ... no amount of compassion (mother's love/father's love) could alter that which was encoded on the child's DNA (if you will). To make Myers' a product of his environment ... well, that's just obvious. I forgot, was this a film or an after-school special?These are the most unbelievably painful problems ... I'll not even launch into the needless deaths of several adults who DO NOT warrant such treatment (by logic and theory). Or Zombie's vile treatment of a ""Halloween"" cult-favorite like Danielle Harris (creepy, but in a pathetic way). Maybe Zombie thought he was evolving the genre ... maybe he thought was modernizing Carpenter's work ... maybe he needs to mature (but he's already forty-five) and learn from the masters (like Carpenter and Hooper): less is better.So, I return to my original question ... ""When have critics ever understood horror?"" I guess I must have forgot that the critics were blown-away by Romero'sDawn of the Dead(1978), raved over Kubrick'sThe Shining(1980), lauded Hooper'sPoltergeist(1982), gushed over Shyamalan'sThe Sixth Sense(1999), and loved Boyle's28 Days Later(2003). I guess they have always known what constitutes film worthy of an audience. Next time, I hope I will take my cue from these professionals ... and, I sincerely hope Zombie will do likewise.",1,My Sincerest Condolences to Carpenter ...,1191024000,"09 29, 2007",2007,3839,"['sting', 'when', 'director', 'kills', 'crowning', 'thing', 'had', 'actually', 'read', 'horrendous', 'critical', 'reviews', 'Zombie', 'film', 'thought', 'When', 'have', 'critics', 'ever', 'understood', 'horror', 'So', 'weird', 'way', 'guess', 'have', 'only', 'blame', 'someone', 'who', 'horror-film', 'theory', 'horror-film', 'studies', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'endure', 'ages', 'what', 'will', 'not', 'Still', ""'m"", 'not', 'jaded', 'academic', 'love', 'horror', 'more', 'figuratively', 'visceral', 'better', ""Carpenter'sHalloween"", '1978', 'well-respected', 'film', 'scholars', 'even', 'snobbiest', 'reason', 'inspire', 'terror', 'little', 'on-screen', 'bloodshed', 'much', ""Hooper'sThe"", 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', '1974', 'works', 'necessitate', 'remake', 'Nispel', '2003', 'revisit', 'TCM', 'elicited', 'tension', 'revulsion', 'good', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'only', 'elicited', 'anger.Foremost', 'film', 'technically', 'unpolished', 'one', 'point', 'viewer', 'convinced', 'Loomis', 'McDowell', 'responsible', 'Myers', 'adult', 'outbursts', 'early', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'Loomis', 'Myers', 'wear', 'black', 'topic', 'conversation', 'parallel', 'two', 'Then', 'Loomis', 'account', 'experience', 'Myers', 'book-tour', 'scene', 'projection', 'Myers', 'face', 'Loomis', 'utters', 'eyes', 'one', 'only', 'blackness', 'absence', 'light', 'are', 'psychopath', 'camera', 'extreme', 'close-up', 'Loomis', 'eyes', 'So', 'entire', 'film', 'viewer', 'waits', 'other', 'shoe', 'drop', 'Loomis', 'confess', 'perhaps', 'unconscious', 'involvement', 'Myers', 'now', 'silent', 'rage', 'never', 'so', 'one', 'led', 'ask', 'why', 'create', 'parallels', 'then', 'fail', 'complete', 'message', 'best', 'may', 'discover', 'connection', 'director', 'cut', 'worst', 'was', 'really', 'unforgivable', 'error', 'filming.The', 'casting', 'Myers', 'horrendous', 'Why', 'make', 'physically', 'monstrous', 'Carpender', 'original', 'casting', 'Nick', 'Castle', 'was', 'clever', 'tall', 'muscular', 'Zombie', 'casting', 'WWF/WCW', 'wrestler', 'Tyler', 'Mane', '6', '8', 'grotesquely', 'built', 'was', 'too', 'literal', 'Carpender', 'Myers', 'terrifies', 'audiences', 'having', 'appear', 'physically', 'extraordinary', 'Shape', 'know', 'not', 'Lumbering', 'Blob', 'Moreover', 'providing', 'one', 'most', 'wretched', 'back-stories', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'Zombie', 'Carpenter', 'most', 'gruesome', 'message', 'people', 'are', 'born', 'evil', 'why', ""Donner'sThe"", 'Omen', '1976', 'was', 'so', 'gripping', 'Damien', 'was', 'born', 'evil', 'amount', 'compassion', 'love', 'could', 'alter', 'was', 'encoded', 'child', 'DNA', 'will', 'make', 'Myers', 'product', 'environment', 'well', 'just', 'obvious', 'forgot', 'was', 'film', 'after-school', 'special', 'are', 'most', 'unbelievably', 'painful', 'problems', ""'ll"", 'not', 'even', 'launch', 'needless', 'deaths', 'several', 'adults', 'who', 'DO', 'NOT', 'warrant', 'such', 'treatment', 'logic', 'theory', 'Zombie', 'vile', 'treatment', 'Halloween', 'cult-favorite', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'creepy', 'pathetic', 'way', 'Maybe', 'Zombie', 'thought', 'was', 'evolving', 'genre', 'maybe', 'thought', 'was', 'modernizing', 'Carpenter', 'work', 'maybe', 'mature', 'already', 'forty-five', 'masters', 'Carpenter', 'Hooper', 'less', 'better.So', 'return', 'original', 'question', 'When', 'have', 'critics', 'ever', 'understood', 'horror', 'guess', 'must', 'have', 'forgot', 'critics', 'were', 'blown-away', ""Romero'sDawn"", 'Dead', '1978', 'raved', ""Kubrick'sThe"", 'Shining', '1980', 'lauded', ""Hooper'sPoltergeist"", '1982', 'gushed', ""Shyamalan'sThe"", 'Sixth', 'Sense', '1999', 'loved', ""Boyle's28"", 'Days', 'Later', '2003', 'guess', 'have', 'always', 'known', 'what', 'film', 'worthy', 'audience', 'Next', 'time', 'hope', 'will', 'take', 'cue', 'professionals', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'Zombie', 'will', 'do', 'likewise']",Halloween

Rob Zombie's 'Halloween' was the worst film of last year and one of the worst ever made. I'm not completely against remakes whatsoever. Films like 'The Fly', 'The Thing', 'The Blob', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and Zack Snyder's 'Dawn of the Dead' were all fantastic second-takes on classic movies. Admittedly, besides 'Dawn' I don't think I've seen a good remake in the past 5 years.I was hopeful for Zombie's reinvention of Michael Myers. I will never fault someone for taking a franchise that pretty much crapped the bed, and trying to make it scary again. After 'H20' and the putrid 'Resurrection' I would have paid to see Michael in a college road trip flick for the possibility of an intentional laugh. Zombie instead took the reigns and delivered what I believe to be the worst 'Halloween' film in the entire series--and I have some hardcore hate for 'Revenge', 'H20' and 'Resurrection'.This film fails in the first five minutes. The director can't stay away from white-trash characters filling his scenes with hilariously ridiculous dialogue. The fact that we're to follow Michael Myers from his awkward tween years on up is such a horrible misstep. We don't want to know what Michael Myers looks like in the principal's office. John Carpenter showed us a kid in a clown suit with a giant, bloody carving knife--and that was all we needed. It's scarier when we aren't held by the hand and shown exactly why a guy decides to put on a mask and kill people. All Rob had to do was tell a new story in Haddonfield and it would have sufficed. Instead we're subjected to countless poorly directed scenes with despicable characters you don't care about spouting high school-esque dialogue before being stabbed. It's pathetic filmmaking, and it's laughable that anyone involved in this honeybucket of a movie would try to justify its existence.It's sad if the new generation of horror fans embrace drivel like this. Do yourselves a favor and buy Carpenter's masterful original. If you've already seen this then I hope you're one day able to burn it from your memory...

I believe that Rob Zombie has talent, but his sensibilities are Tobe Hooper/Geek Show attraction.  This is perfect for House of 1,000 Corpses or Devil's Rejects but doesn't lend itself to Halloween at all.  John Carpenter grew up on Howard Hawks (which shows in Assault on Precinct 13) and JC's remakes of Howard Hawks production, The Thing.  Rob Zombie may've been impacted by Halloween but doesn't understand it the way John Carpenter understood The Thing.  That's the problem.Though some remakes are valid - the trouble of a remake is: Good or Bad - it erases the original film from public memory.  This is a problem, especially in horror because the next generation of horror fans will grow up without knowledge and respect for the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, and soon - A Nightmare on Elm St.In he 2007 Halloween, nearly an hour is wasted on Michael's Trashy upbringing in one of the most pointless origin stories ever put on screen since The Grinch.  What made John Carpenter's Halloween so scary is that Michael can't be expalined - he had a good family.  His evil is a mystery which is what makes him fascinating.  Rob Zombie's may be true to life but it's boring as hell.Then the last 40 minutes is a sped up re-make of the original.  We don't get any time to know the kids and none of them are even remotely interesting.  As a fan of Zombie's first two films - I anticipated this one, knowing he was wrong for it, but hoping he'd pull it off and make something interesting.I was wrong, both he and Neil Marshal (with Doomsday) neutralized the impact of their last two fascinating films.

1102488,A1EGZYG8PC51U5,B000VKL6Z2,"D. Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[3, 3]","And make no bones about it, the original masterpiece by John Carpenter did NOT need to be remade, however; this does go to show that on occasion, given some style and a slightly different approach, a remake can work (hey Hollywood, originality works even better!).  I begrudgingly went to see this (a friend offered me a free ticket so...), more out of curiosity and an urge to back up my preconceived notions that this would be utter garbage, rather than for enjoyment or entertainment purposes.  So just imagine my suprise when by the end of the film I was as giddy as a junior highschool boy with a pack of cigarettes and a porno magazine!  Director Rob Zombie actually brings enough unique and original material to the Michael Myers mythos that we understand (kinda) why he becomes what he ultimately becomes... an awesome and unstoppable killing machine!  Oddly enough though, this also works as a detracting factor, because although Rob does a nice job showing us an origin for one of the best (if not THE greatest) slasher icons of all time (which TCM: The Begining was completely inept at doing), in the end though, I still feel it was much creepier knowing less rather than more.  In Carpenter's original, Michael looks like a normal kid from a normal middle class family and you never know or understand why he did what he did on that fateful Halloween night... while in Zombie's version, Michael comes from a bad white trash family and is constantly under verbal and physical abuse from those around him.  Not nearly as suprising or shocking when he does finally lose it, in fact you end up almost rooting for him to let loose.  The movie provides considerably enough new material that if Rob had decided to rename the characters and change Myers into some other distinctive madman of his own creation he probably could have had an exciting new slasher franchise on his hands... but instead he put his own spin on Halloween, and he did a nice job of it.  Acting is top notch throughout (if not a little over done at times) and the killings are as realistic and brutal as I've seen in awhile (including a cringe worthy baseball bat to the head... several times!), plus thankfully Carpenter's original score also returns for some scenes.  This version is actually sleazier and more exploitative than the original (much like the equally excellent ""Hills Have Eyes"" remake was) and pushes the language, nudity, and graphic content way past it's predecessor (which the original didn't need to be a great movie but...) and helps it to stand on it's own two blood stained boots.  Not being particullarly fond of either Rob Zombie as a director OR remakes says quite allot for the film, and I've rarely had a better time watching a movie while simutaneously being transformed into a hypocrite!  I'd recommend this to any and all horror fans, not everyone will like it, but you might be suprised at how many of you will.  Also keep and eye out for the always great Ken Foree (original Dawn Of The Dead, From Beyond) as trucker Joe Grizzly in my favorite scene from the movie which features him on the toilet doing battle with a taco salad and Michael Myers (no really... I can't make this stuff up)!",4,Surprisingly as enjoyable as it was unnescessary...,1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,3201,"['make', 'bones', 'original', 'masterpiece', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'did', 'NOT', 'need', 'be', 'remade', 'however', 'go', 'show', 'occasion', 'given', 'style', 'slightly', 'different', 'approach', 'remake', 'can', 'work', 'hey', 'Hollywood', 'originality', 'works', 'even', 'better', 'begrudgingly', 'went', 'see', 'friend', 'offered', 'free', 'ticket', 'so', 'more', 'curiosity', 'urge', 'back', 'up', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'would', 'be', 'utter', 'garbage', 'rather', 'enjoyment', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'So', 'just', 'imagine', 'suprise', 'when', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'giddy', 'junior', 'highschool', 'boy', 'pack', 'cigarettes', 'porno', 'magazine', 'Director', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'actually', 'enough', 'unique', 'original', 'material', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'mythos', 'understand', 'kinda', 'why', 'what', 'ultimately', 'awesome', 'unstoppable', 'killing', 'machine', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'also', 'detracting', 'factor', 'Rob', 'nice', 'job', 'showing', 'origin', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'THE', 'greatest', 'slasher', 'icons', 'time', 'TCM', 'Begining', 'was', 'completely', 'inept', 'doing', 'end', 'still', 'feel', 'was', 'much', 'creepier', 'knowing', 'less', 'rather', 'more', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'Michael', 'normal', 'kid', 'normal', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'never', 'know', 'understand', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'fateful', 'Halloween', 'night', 'Zombie', 'version', 'Michael', 'bad', 'white', 'trash', 'family', 'constantly', 'verbal', 'physical', 'abuse', 'Not', 'nearly', 'suprising', 'shocking', 'when', 'finally', 'lose', 'fact', 'end', 'up', 'almost', 'rooting', 'let', 'loose', 'movie', 'considerably', 'enough', 'new', 'material', 'Rob', 'had', 'decided', 'rename', 'characters', 'change', 'Myers', 'other', 'distinctive', 'madman', 'own', 'creation', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'exciting', 'new', 'slasher', 'franchise', 'hands', 'instead', 'put', 'own', 'spin', 'Halloween', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'Acting', 'top', 'notch', 'not', 'little', 'done', 'times', 'killings', 'are', 'realistic', 'brutal', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'including', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'baseball', 'bat', 'head', 'several', 'times', 'thankfully', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'score', 'also', 'scenes', 'version', 'actually', 'sleazier', 'more', 'exploitative', 'original', 'much', 'equally', 'excellent', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'remake', 'was', 'language', 'nudity', 'graphic', 'content', 'way', 'predecessor', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'blood', 'stained', 'boots', 'Not', 'being', 'particullarly', 'fond', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'director', 'OR', 'quite', 'allot', 'film', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'had', 'better', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'simutaneously', 'being', 'transformed', 'hypocrite', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'horror', 'fans', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'might', 'be', 'suprised', 'how', 'many', 'will', 'Also', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'always', 'great', 'Ken', 'Foree', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'From', 'Beyond', 'trucker', 'Joe', 'Grizzly', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'toilet', 'doing', 'battle', 'taco', 'salad', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'stuff', 'up']",Halloween

1102492,A27Q1LRDZK3C76,B000VKL6Z2,EpsilonX,"[0, 1]","I'm going to try to be brief here.  The thing about this movie is...it's gritty.  They swear a lot, the teens are perverted, it's bloody and brutal.  But it's also realistic.  The camerawork makes the scenes look real, not extremely neat and tidy like in some recent movies.  It's all believable.  Also, the story is very absorbing.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen the first time i watched it.something i've read many complaints about is the fact that michael is now human.  Personally, i think a human that goes insane is far scarier than just a dude that can't die.  It shows michael as he travels down the dark road, becoming more unstable than before, but still seems to have some grasp on reality (a scene towards the end of the movie).  It also shows his family, which adds sort of an emotional level to the film.Don't even bother watching the movie if you're going to compare it to John Carpenter's Halloween.  Rob Zombie's Halloween is completely different.  If you're not willing to watch the movie without analyzing everything about it, then don't bother.  You won't enjoy it.  Also, if you dislike shaky camera movements, don't watch it.Now, for the unrated version vs the theatrical version.  I heard the Unrated flows a bit better, but there are 2 scenes in the unrated that are different from the theatrical.  1 being when he escapes, and the other being the ending.

While the introduction and history of the pre-teen Michael Myers was nice as a prequel of sorts, the almost word-for-word remake of that fateful Halloween night fifteen years when ""He"" came home lacked the same spark as the first time around. Each new actor seemed to turn in a murder-by-numbers approach with the established characters, and the movie's new ending really paled in comparision to the 1978 original. While to any fan of the Halloween franchise should see this at least once, it will definitely NOT replace your yearly viewings of the original. If only Rob Zombie concentrated on making a prequel only instead of this watered down attempt to lure a new generation of audiences, this could have been a little more satifiying.While I'm here, let me let others in on what exactly is on that Circuit City exclusive bonus third disc. First off, it's in a paper sleeve (not part of the original packaging), that has only one extra feature, a 20 minute discussion with Rob Zombie & three other cast members at Comic-Con 2007. In fact, it doesn't even have a menu, just plop in the disc and it begins. I was wondering why this wasn't just put on the 2 disc as maybe an easter egg or something, it should have fit in the space nicely. Oh, and concerning that regular's second disc....if you missed Malcolm McDowell's personality from ""A Clockwork Orange"" after he made that film, check out the 10 minutes of Bloopers with him, he's a riot, almost as if this film brought out the lost ""Alex De Large"" outta him again.

1102495,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B000VKL6Z2,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[1, 1]","Rob Zombie's ambitious retelling of the Carpenter classic met with negative to mixed results. In my opinion, he may have bit off more than he can chew. I admire his passion for the genre and the film has its merits but overall, the film is inferior to the original.Carpenter's original ""Halloween"" is iconic and remains a classic. It is one of my favorite films of all time and I constantly re-watch it because I love it. The film does not rely on excess, over-the-top violence and gore to get its point across. The gore is minimal yet it overflows with tension, fear, suspense and mystery which elevates this rather simple tale to great cinematic heights. Even Roger Ebert (RIP) compared it to Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". Furthermore, Carpenter didn't really explain much. He simply gave us some spine-tingling images starting off with a chilling scene of a boy brutally killing his sister on a sinister Halloween night and culminating with that image of an empty yard where moments prior, Michael Myers lay dead from a gunshot wound to the head and 5 to the chest. We are left with questions. Why did this little boy kill his sister? Why did he return to Haddonfield 15 years later? Why does he stalk a shy high school student and her obnoxious friends? Why does he want to kill her? But .....do we really need to know this? Not really. Carpenter didn't even attempt to let us in on the mind of Michael Myers. Let us make up our own minds on why this evil exists. This is where I think Zombie tried too hard. The entire first half of his film is dedicated in showing us why Michael Myers became Michael Myers. In vain, he tried to give a face-less, murderous monster a soul. In doing so, he stripped away the mystery, the mythology. Also, in telling his tale he squeezed in as many unpleasant stereotypes as possible. In Zombie's version, Michael (played by Daeg Faerch as a child) was a dysfunctional, un-kept, disturbed social misfit. His mother Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper and didn't really have the means to emotionally support her dysfunctional offspring. Her abusive, drunk boyfriend Ronnie (William Forsythe), who is obviously a negative influence lives with them as does Myers' egotistical, selfish, sex-crazed sister Judith (Hanna R. Hall) and let's not forget the school bully. Yuppers, I guess with so much wrong in this kids surroundings, it is understandable why he tortures small animals and is destined to become a mass murderer. In my opinion, it does not work. I do not think that there is enough time here to fully explain how a mentally sick child can turn into such an incredible, invincible mass killing machine. Zombie may have been successful in showing us how the young Myers could have become a Ted Bundy or a ""Jack the Ripper"" type killer... but never Michael Myers. Anyhow, due to neglect, emotional abuse, and mental problems, the young Myers snaps and commits some grisly murders on Halloween night. After a lengthy trial, he is found guilty of first degree murder and committed to the Smith's Grove - Warren County Sanitarium where he is looked over by psychologist Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and is visited frequently by his mother. It is within the walls of the Sanitarium that Myers begins another mental decent into madness. He becomes obsessed with making sinister papier-mch&eacute; masks. Dr. Loomis and Deborah try in vain to reach through to him but the boy just zones out and become more withdrawn until he is just an empty shell and when least suspected, commits another bloody act that proved to all the boy is a murderous psychopath. The story then jumps ahead several years. Michael (now portrayed by Tyler Mane), still withdrawn, unkempt, and massive (the guy looks to be at least 7 feet tall) escapes and returns to Haddonfield where he begins stalking the unsuspecting Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her friends. The rest of the film, despite some differences, is similar to the original film and follows the typical slasher formula. Lots of grisly executions, nudity and lots and lots of screaming.As already stated, I just could not believe the chubby, androgynous, awkward blonde kid from the first part of the film became the 7 foot, invincible, hulking monster of the second half. It was not believable to me. I do appreciate that Zombie tried to take the tale in another direction and I did not expect him to give us a total rehash of the original film. Had he done so, he would have been criticized for not being original. In a tale like ""Halloween"", less is more and Zombie simply put, gave us too much. The atmosphere is also lacking. The ominous dark tones of the original was shoved to the side to make room for some trashy, unlikeable, uninteresting characters and lots and lots of vulgarity. This does not mean the film has no merits. As a slasher film, it delivers and this version out-does the original in sheer brutality. This Michael remains a spectacular villain. His size overwhelms and his grisly executions leave us no doubt he has a bone to pick with humanity. There are also some unsettling images such as those scenes that show a voiceless, withdrawn child in a psychiatric ward wearing sinister papier mch&eacute; masks. I just wished the rest of the film was this effective. Watch it for the gore, the spills, and for some of the performances (Malcolm McDowell, Sheri Moon Zombie is surprisingly effective here). Try not to compare it to the original. The magic that made that film so good is unfortunately missing here.This version is the Unrated Director's Cut and is loaded with extras - Commentary, deleted scenes, bloopers etc that should please

1102496,A2VG5D8DQ7TESG,B000VKL6Z2,"E. Villasor ""tedi31""","[3, 4]","Halloween (2007) Director Rob Zombie seems to be no stranger to serial killer/horror genre after past projects (e.g., The Devil's Rejects (2005) and House of 1000 Corpses (2003)) that have focused on similar themes.  However, remaking a cinema classic such as the John Carpenter's 1978 Halloween is no ""walk in the park"" given the film's established cult following.But Rob Zombie seemed up to the task with an excellent screenplay that focuses on Michael Myers troubled beginnings as an 8-year old child from a broken home; his fetish for masks; as well as the subsequent homicides, fratricide, and to some extent--matricide--as his mother committed suicide following Myers initially killing spree. These horrific and visually graphic events (the film has been Rated R for strong brutal bloody violence and terror throughout, sexual content, graphic nudity and language.) eventually lead to Myers incarceration at Smith's Grove Sanitarium for the next 15 years.Upon his inadvertent liberation at the hands of a decadent watchman and his equally obtuse cousin, Myers picks up where he left off, spilling carnage along his path until he comes face-to-face with his younger sister and former physician Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell; Star Trek: Generations).Much like most slasher-flicks of the past, Halloween (2007) does not present a fresh take on this age-old formula.

You take something familiar, you get a pseudo-hip inferior cast and you send them out to mangle the cultural landscape. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake does this.

But Rob Zombie didn't do that, regardless of all of the things he has done.Comparing this to the original is like comparing Frank Oz's Little Shop of Horrors to Corman' s. Of course Frank Oz's is different. It's a musical. It stars Rick Moranis, It was made twenty years later for another audience and it burlesques the silliness of the original. Complaining that this ruins Halloween or lacks the atmosphere of the original is completely missing the point. Zombie has taken a movie with strong Giallo influence and infused it with splatpunk. It is not a thriller, it is a gritty, brutal slasher film that is not meant to have socially redeeming qualities but rather to bring Myers into the 21st century. It doesn't completely succeed at this.

1102502,A2SXGU7L6VLJ5P,B000VKL6Z2,Gogol,"[3, 4]","OK first off I wasn't expecting too much when I first saw this film.  I wasn't watching it with a note pad and pencil closely examining every discrepancy with the original film nor did I expect it to stand up to the original but then to be honest I didn't really care.I watched it as an entertaining slasher movie just as the original was.  I guess some people forget that the director commentated that his son loved the films so much because when he took a girl to the movies she would cling hold of him during the scary moments.  I guess some forgot that the original film was designed to entertain and I seriously doubt that too many went to watch it and then came out of cinema describing it as a cinematic masterpiece along side Lawrence of Arabia or Casablanca.The film starts off with Young Michael's troubled childhood in what I would guess is a small town somewhere.  His mother is a pole dancer, his father? a drunk, wife/kid beater who seems to give his every breath to abusing all around him, his sister while probably the better of the bunch is a bit of a ahem 'girl around town'Michael carves up small furry animals in his spare time and gets bullied by the local kids eventually getting pushed too far when he gets found out taking various dead things to school (as you do) He takes his revenge on one of his bullies in the most horrific of ways (The scene lasts so long it is pretty disturbing) and then decided to chop up the family (well you know the rest)The film goes on to chronicle his stay in a mental institution and the reason why he constantly wears a mask (another reviewer has already pointed out why he has taken up the mask he became famous for) carrying out one more horrific attack before making good his escape (in the most unbelievable of ways) picks up a new set of clothes and his trademark knife in an equally ridiculous way, (he was walking around in his slippers and dressing gown prior to that (now why would anyone notice a 6 foot 6 hippie in his dressing gown wandering around the streets?)) and then heads for his home town to kill a few folks.So begins pretty much a re-run of the original Halloween film.  Few naked babes, lots of blood, Michael appearing and disappearing whenever the mood takes him and his former shrink running about the place flapping while the local police wander about aimlessly.Horror films are not supposed to have amazing plots they should frighten, shock, disgust and sometimes amuse the audience and this film does a fairly good job. Much of it makes absolutely no sense at all (Michael breaking his chains at will, taking out all who stand before him etc etc) But the same could be said for the original.  Yeh there were discrepancies with the time like but really, this is a horror film I guess if I wanted to be intellectually stimulated by a film I would have gone for a French flick set in a Parisian apartment where some middle aged artist 'analyzes' sex for 2 hours but I didn't I just wanted a bit of cheap gore and I got it.Not a bad little remake, just don't take it too seriously.",3,Not the greatest film in the world but not the worst either,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,3064,"['first', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'watching', 'note', 'pad', 'pencil', 'closely', 'examining', 'discrepancy', 'original', 'film', 'did', 'expect', 'stand', 'up', 'original', 'then', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care.I', 'watched', 'entertaining', 'slasher', 'movie', 'just', 'original', 'was', 'guess', 'people', 'forget', 'director', 'commentated', 'son', 'loved', 'films', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'took', 'girl', 'movies', 'would', 'cling', 'hold', 'scary', 'moments', 'guess', 'forgot', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'designed', 'entertain', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'too', 'many', 'went', 'watch', 'then', 'came', 'cinema', 'describing', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'side', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Casablanca.The', 'film', 'Young', 'Michael', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'what', 'would', 'guess', 'small', 'town', 'somewhere', 'mother', 'pole', 'dancer', 'father', 'drunk', 'wife/kid', 'beater', 'who', 'give', 'breath', 'abusing', 'sister', 'probably', 'better', 'bunch', 'bit', 'ahem', ""town'Michael"", 'up', 'small', 'furry', 'animals', 'spare', 'time', 'bullied', 'local', 'kids', 'eventually', 'getting', 'pushed', 'too', 'far', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'taking', 'various', 'dead', 'things', 'school', 'do', 'revenge', 'one', 'bullies', 'most', 'horrific', 'ways', 'scene', 'so', 'long', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'then', 'decided', 'chop', 'up', 'family', 'well', 'know', 'rest', 'film', 'chronicle', 'stay', 'mental', 'institution', 'reason', 'why', 'constantly', 'mask', 'reviewer', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'why', 'taken', 'up', 'mask', 'became', 'famous', 'carrying', 'out', 'one', 'more', 'horrific', 'attack', 'making', 'good', 'escape', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'ways', 'up', 'new', 'set', 'clothes', 'trademark', 'knife', 'equally', 'ridiculous', 'way', 'was', 'walking', 'around', 'slippers', 'dressing', 'gown', 'prior', 'now', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'notice', '6', 'foot', '6', 'hippie', 'dressing', 'gown', 'wandering', 'streets', 'then', 'heads', 'home', 'town', 'kill', 'few', 'folks.So', 'pretty', 'much', 're-run', 'original', 'Halloween', 'film', 'Few', 'naked', 'babes', 'lots', 'blood', 'Michael', 'appearing', 'disappearing', 'whenever', 'mood', 'former', 'shrink', 'running', 'place', 'flapping', 'local', 'police', 'wander', 'aimlessly.Horror', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'have', 'amazing', 'plots', 'should', 'frighten', 'shock', 'disgust', 'sometimes', 'amuse', 'audience', 'film', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'Much', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'Michael', 'breaking', 'chains', 'will', 'taking', 'out', 'who', 'stand', 'etc', 'etc', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'original', 'were', 'discrepancies', 'time', 'really', 'horror', 'film', 'guess', 'wanted', 'be', 'intellectually', 'stimulated', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'French', 'flick', 'set', 'Parisian', 'apartment', 'where', 'middle', 'aged', 'artist', 'sex', '2', 'hours', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'wanted', 'bit', 'cheap', 'gore', 'got', 'it.Not', 'bad', 'little', 'remake', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously']",Halloween

1102507,A3OHB78Y7L7ZK,B000VKL6Z2,GSD,"[0, 3]","Why remake a perfect film? Rob Zombie asked himself this same question when it came to making and directing this movie. There are several reasons why Michael Myers (also known as The Shape) endures as a horror icon. One reason is because John Carpenter's 1978 classic was the first film since Psycho (1960) to really create a memorable horror movie villain. Another reason might be that Halloween was such a well made film that it has become a benchmark of the horror genre. So why remake the movie? Your guess is as good as mine. It could be that we have been living in an age of big budget Hollywood remakes for about 10 years now. And who better than to make this production a reality than Rob Zombie who did 2 really solid horror flicks before this (House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects).The problem is that the 2007 Halloween remake, while it adheres to the basic story elements of the original, it takes Michael Myers and his supporting characters out of the comfort zone that Halloween fans were in and turns these beloved characters into shadows of their former selves.Michael Myers becomes a product of abuse and a trailer trash upbringing and that is to serve as his motive for being a psychotic killer. The mystery that existed in the original film is removed. Laurie Strode starts out close to the original portrayal as offered by scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis, a shy wallflower, but by the end of the film she is little more than a rebellious, psychologically scarred teenager. Dr. Loomis is played as wholly different than in the original film as well... He is a much colder and stranger personality and less of a serious psychiatrist bent on helping or stopping his mad patient.

The backstory begins in 1978 in Haddonfield, Illinois, when Michael is 10 years old, portrayed by Daeg Faerch, who adores his mother Deborah (portrayed by Sheri Moon Zombie) but hates her boyfriend Ronnie White (William Forsythe). His older sister Judith (Hanna Hall) is promiscuous and this bothers Michael. The other member of his family he adores is his younger sister Laurie, whom he affectionately calls ""Boo."" Michael's path of destruction begins with killing animals and then graduates to full-fledged murder, of his older sister, his mother's boyfriend, his sister's boyfriend and a schoolyard bully. He is then sent to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where he is evaluated by Psychiatrist Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) who treats him for 15 years until Michael begins not speaking and shuts himself down emotionally. Michael begins an affinity for masks while locked in the Sanitarium, an obsession really, and is seen more often than not wearing homemade masks. After Loomis stops treatment and becomes a best-selling author, profiting from the deaths his patient caused, Michael, now an adult (Tyler Mane (X-Men)) escapes, killing several along the way. He then makes his way to Haddonfield, where he stalks his now-teenage sister (portrayed by Scout Taylor-Compton). Laurie's parents are portrayed by Dee Wallace Stone (Abominable, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Cujo, The Howling) and Pat Skipper, and her two friends, Lynda and Annie Brackett, are portrayed by Kristina Klebe and Danielle Harris (Halloween 4, Halloween 5). The rest of the film should be familiar to fans of the original, with a few surprises along the way. I should warn you-with this unrated edition, there is plenty of sex, there is plenty of swearing, there is plenty of nudity, and yes, there is plenty of violence. But these elements help to propel the story along and really make for a film experience unlike any seen in 2007. This film is not an exact carbon-copy of the original, it is not a sequel, and is not exactly a straight remake; it is a film which stands on its own as a true masterpiece of modern horror and terror.

1102512,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B000VKL6Z2,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 1]","When I went to see Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's immortal classic called ""Halloween"", I went into the theater with an open mind. The feeling that I got after leaving the cinema was that Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" would have been a decent horror movie in its own right if it had not been named ""Halloween"" and if it had not attempted to remake the original classic. After having seen the director's cut as well as the theatrical version, I can say that as a horror movie in and of itself, the ""Halloween"" remake is not bad and is actually a brutal and violent slasher film that is capable of producing some horror.With that being said, you have to come up with something more than what you get in this movie if you want to try and do a remake of one of the greatest horror movies of all-time in the original ""Halloween"" and call yourself, a success or an effective remake. Otherwise, you open yourself up to a tremendous amount of criticism, and you are going to get hammered. First, the acting in the remake was clearly inferior in every conceivable way compared to the original, most glaring was the inept performance of the actor who played Dr. Loomis in this remake. I thought he was just AWFUL, not just compared to the brilliant Donald Pleasance, but just AWFUL. In fact, the acting in general caused me to be unsympathetic to the characters. There really aren't any likeable characters in this movie when you think about it, unlike the original ""Halloween"" in which how could one not like Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode? These type of characters are completely missing in the remake, and that is only one reason why the remake is inferior to the original ""Halloween"". Also, does every single one of Rob Zombie's characters have to be white trash? I am not just talking about this remake either...I am talking about all of his movies. It must some kind of neurotic obsession of Mr. Zombie's I guess.The next point that should be made is the degenerative family that Zombie uses to attempt to explain why Michael Myers goes mentally insane. I think Zombie should be commended (and I have been very critical of his films-claiming he should stick to music) for trying to change things up, but he tries to explain too much of the darkness in Michael Myers and that takes away from the mystery and horror of the ""Boogeyman"" factor if you will. In other words, I believe that Michael Myers is a lot scarier in the original because we do not know why he went off the way he did and killed his sister whereas the remake attempts to portray Michael Myers as a victim of a degenerative family.By the same token, Zombie focuses a lot more on the childhood of Michael Myers in an attempt to differentiate his remake from the classic. From that standpoint, I admire Zombie's effort and creativity, but I just do not believe that the remake is anywhere near as effective as the original as a horror movie. Sure, there's plenty more violence in the remake, but does that necessarily mean that it is scarier? I would argue that it does not. Perhaps the most glaring flaw in Zombie's remake is the failure to match or even attempt to match the atmosphere that is so ever-present in the original. In my opinion, Zombie is unable to present the Halloween theme anywhere near as well as Carpenter, and that is an understatement. Indeed, Zombie's focus is clearly on Myers whereas Carpenter's focus was on Myers as the ""Boogeyman"" and Halloween itself. Zombie completely fails to capture the Halloween theme...PERIOD. We just do not have this in the remake, and that is the main reason why I believe that the remake would have been received better had it not been a remake of the immortal classic. In other words, if Zombie had attempted to fashion this movie as a modern slasher instead of trying to create a remake of ""Halloween"" out of it, this movie would have been more effective, more accepted, and more of a success. Oh, sure, the remake was a tremendous financial success, but, hell, anyone could have made a movie and called it a remake of John Carpenter's masterpiece, ""Halloween"", and gotten millions of dollars just off of the name of the flick, so the amount of money this remake brought in does not tell us anything.Undoubtedly, the remake of ""Halloween"" is dripping with this generation's lifestyle with a focus on these gothic and long-haired type of people, not to mention Zombie's unquestioned preference for white trash characters. Zombie tries to be hardcore with his remake, and that is fine. In fact, I did not see one normal looking person in the entire movie...no offense, but did anyone notice how all of the men had long hair like 80s rock stars in this movie? I am not just talking about Michael Myers either...I am talking about Dr. Loomis. Clearly, this was an attempt by Zombie to cater to this generation's 20-something year olds. As a result, I fear that many people who were too young to grow up with the original ""Halloween"" will probably like the remake better because they can unfortunately relate to these types of characters as being part and parcel of this generation. Oh well, to each his own.At any rate, I give Zombie credit for at least trying to be creative and imaginative with the remake to some extent and not copying it word for word (although he did do some copying for sure) like the remake of ""Psycho"". That said, the ""Halloween"" remake would have been better if it had not tried to be ""Halloween"", but rather if it had attempted to be a modern slasher with a different name basing itself on its own individual charm because this movie could have done that. Sure, some changes would have had to been made, but it could have survived on its own merit without being a remake of ""Halloween"". However, the fact of the matter is that this is an inferior remake of one of if not the greatest horror movie of all-time, and I cannot assign it more than two (2) stars because it is simply categorically inferior to John Carpenter's original classic masterpiece in every conceivable way.In conclusion, the remake is different enough to stand on its own, but it lacks the spirit of the original classic, and it is simply no where near as good or as scary as the original. However, this is par for the course for these Hollywood remakes of the classics. I am wondering what is next?As a matter of fact, it should be noted that the only remake, in my opinion, that has measured up to the original would be the remake of ""Cape Fear"" by Martin Scorcese. Why was that successful and effective? Surprise!! It had great acting, great execution and a great director! There is a hint Hollywood if you want to remake classic movies, but what difference does it make? I mean, hell, Rob Zombie is laughing all the way to the bank.",2,"Entertaining as a slasher, but FAILS to recapture the atmosphere and brilliance of the original",1193788800,"10 31,

One look at the reviews here on Amazon is proof; nearly equal amounts of 1 star and 5 star ratings. But the truth is that Zombie, for all of his artistic imperfections, did indeed do Carpenter justice with his riveting remake. And that's a rarity in itself, with the more recent reworking of 'Evil Dead' being the only other modern horror remake worthy of acclaim.Where Carpenter succeeded with a sparse, quiet quality to create chills, Zombie knows no such restraints. He encourages histrionics from his actors, which works when blessed with a strong cast (see 'The Devil's Rejects', still his strongest work).

1102522,AQ01Q3070LT29,B000VKL6Z2,James McDonald,"[1, 3]","Being a major fan of the originalHalloween (35th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray] (1978),Halloween II(1981),Halloween H2O(1998), of course, I had to go to the movie theater to see this remake, Rob Zombie's Halloween (2007).I was a teenager when the first Halloween (starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence) was out and about, now I'm a mature man with a grown daughter, but I still enjoy the scare of a good horror film.I have seen all of the other 8 ""Halloween"" films, but this Rob Zombie's Halloween had constant cursing that disenchanted me and I found the first act and second act less suspenseful than the original John Carpenter's ""Halloween"".This 2007 version does give you insight to why Michael Myers killed as a child.  In this version, 10-year old Michael's (Daeg Faerch) home life is not the best. His mother, Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper and the house appears to be unkept. Her boyfriend, Ronnie, (William Forsythe) lives in the house and argues and shows no respect towards 10-year old Michael (Daeg Faerch).In the original 1978 version, the two-story house was so immaculate, the parents were older and of middle class.Dare I say, this 2007 film does reflect the way some young people are today and we know of the dysfunctional parents in this day and age too. It makes this film all the more difficult to watch.When young Michael becomes maniac due to the kids bothering him in school and the abusive nature of his mother's boyfriend, Michael kills his school enemy Wesley (Daryl Sabara), Ronnie, Judith, his own sister (Hanna R. Hall) and her boyfriend, Steve (Adam Weisman). he leaves his baby sister, Laurie Strode, alive.Laurie Strode as a teenager is played by Scout Taylor-Compton, now in the role made famous by Jamie Lee Curtis in the original ""Halloween"" movies.This film does not overshadow the cinematography and direction of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), which is still the best scare and suspense of any Halloween film.While Rob Zombie's adult ""Michael Myers"" is more giant, grisly and brutal (played by Tyler Mane), Zombie did open my eyes and made a very daring motion in the final act.We all know of the chilling ending in the original Halloween (1978), but director/writer Rob Zombie went even further and beyond this point for 15 more minutes. The climax that Rob Zombie added to his ending was very new, fresh and so suspenseful, I was on the edge of my seat.  The last 15 minutes surprised me and the last minute twist was fantastic. It left you wanting more.Of all the ""Halloween"" films, only Danielle Harris, fromHalloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers (Divimax Edition)(1988),Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers (Divimax Edition)(1989), makes an appearance in this 2007 film as a different character ""Annie Brackett"".Also in the film:Leslie Easterbrook, Sid Haig, Brad Dourif, Udo Kier, Skyler Gisomdo, Sybil Danning.Danny Trejo (Runaway train (1985), Death Wish 4: The Crackdown (1987), Grindhouse (2007)/Grindhouse (2007), Machete (2010).Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead 1978,2004).Dee Wallace (The Howling 1981, E.T.

It's a interesting idea to bring back a classic to the big screen in this age. The only problem is if you can't make it just as good as the original then leave it alone.The film way just way too much in the way of gore. I love how the original focused more on terror then tons of blood and guts, leaving the brutality more to the imagination then right in front of your eyes. Then there is Laurie. The way she was portrayed in this version was far from innocent and extremely annoying. I was actually hoping Myers would kill her to shut her up. The original made her so innocent which added to the terror. Then you have the ultra white trash Myers family which was yet another strike. The original showed michael coming from the typical middle class family which made it so much more effective. And what about Dr. Loomis? Thank God they didn't cast this guy as the original. Halloween just isn't the same without the real Loomis. The only thing that did make sense was the freakish size of myers. I mean he always seemed to have superhuman strength but looked like a normal size man. Here he was a monster. This would explain why he could crush someones head with his bare hands.Overall I feel this remake just missed the mark in so many ways. I really did want to like it, but just couldn't find enough to do so. I felt it lacked any kind of horror.

This movie was awesome I loved this movie Rob Zombie knows how to make a great solid film. I saw the theatrical and I own the unrated collector's edition on Blu ray. But let me say that the unrated was much more better of a movie, the only differance between is that Rob took out spacific part and replaced them with new scenes. Like the escape scene where Michael kills all the security gaurds and gets out that is changed to a new escape scene. The story it's pretty cool, in the beginning of the story there's a how story behind the reason Micheal does what he does, like what he did when he was a kid. The kid that plays Michael as a kid did an amazing job in this film.The cast is great there's Tyler Mane as Michael Myers, Scout-Tayler Compton as Laurie Strode, Brad Douref as Sherrif Bracket, Deag Fearch as young Michael Myers, Sheri Moon Zombie as Micheal Myers mother, Daniell Harris as Anne, Hannah Hall as Michael's sister, and a bunch of other great actors.

1102532,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000VKL6Z2,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[4, 7]","Rob Zombie has done a very good job in remaking one of horror's most classic films.  Seldom do remakes live up to the original, but this scary film comes very close and adds in some extras along the way.Unlike the original Halloween, Zombie's version starts out with the entire Myers family.  Young Michael (Daeg Faerch) is constantly tormented by other children at school.  They make fun of his stripper mom Deborah Myers (Sheri Moon Zombie) and his promiscuous sister. Deborah's slob of a boyfriend Ronnie White (William Forsythe) spends his days lying on the couch and hurling insults at the rest of the family.  The only person that Michael is somewhat close to is his baby sister.One day, the tormenting from the other children goes too far, and Michael snaps.  One child is killed, and Michael then kills his sister, her boyfriend, and Ronnie on Halloween night.  His mother finds him holding his baby sister on the steps outside the house.Michael is put on trial, found guilty, and sentenced to a mental hospital.  At the hospital, Michael is placed under the care of Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell).  At first, Dr. Loomis sees Michael as a troubled child who has no recollection of what he has done.  He longs to go home to be with his mother.  But, as time passes, Michael slips deeper and deeper into a shell.  He begins wearing masks constantly and soon, he snaps again.  More people are killed, Michael escapes, and he heads back to Haddonfield to claim his last victim; his young sister Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), who was adopted after Michael's earlier killing spree.The events after this point unfold pretty much the same as they did in John Carpenter's original Halloween.  There are some subtle differences but, for the most part, Zombie follows the original very closely until the end, which is very different from the original.I am a big fan of Carpenter's Halloween movies, and I was anxious to see how this version compared to the earlier ones.  I was very impressed with Zombie's film.  What I liked most about this movie was the look into Michael Myers' early life and how he became the madman he turned out to be.  Unlike the beginning of Carpenter's film, where the viewer only sees Michael killing his sister, Zombie spends almost an hour of film time setting the stage for Michael's slide from a troubled child to maniacal killer.  He also makes the viewer feel somewhat sympathetic for Michael, due to his troubled upbringing by a mom who works as a stripper and a deadbeat boyfriend.I recommend this movie very highly.  Rob Zombie has taken a classic horror film and reworked it in such a way as to make it almost better than the original.  I still prefer Carpenter's version over Zombie's, but this scary movie is definitely worth watching.",4,A Very Good Remake,1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,2786,"['Rob', 'Zombie', 'done', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'remaking', 'one', 'horror', 'most', 'classic', 'films', 'Seldom', 'do', 'remakes', 'live', 'up', 'original', 'scary', 'film', 'very', 'close', 'extras', 'way.Unlike', 'original', 'Halloween', 'Zombie', 'version', 'out', 'entire', 'Myers', 'family', 'Young', 'Michael', 'Daeg', 'Faerch', 'constantly', 'tormented', 'other', 'children', 'school', 'make', 'fun', 'stripper', 'mom', 'Deborah', 'Myers', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'promiscuous', 'sister', 'Deborah', 'slob', 'boyfriend', 'Ronnie', 'White', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'days', 'lying', 'couch', 'hurling', 'insults', 'rest', 'family', 'only', 'person', 'Michael', 'somewhat', 'close', 'baby', 'sister.One', 'day', 'tormenting', 'other', 'children', 'too', 'far', 'Michael', 'snaps', 'One', 'child', 'killed', 'Michael', 'then', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'Ronnie', 'Halloween', 'night', 'mother', 'holding', 'baby', 'sister', 'steps', 'house.Michael', 'put', 'trial', 'found', 'guilty', 'sentenced', 'mental', 'hospital', 'hospital', 'Michael', 'placed', 'care', 'Dr.', 'Samuel', 'Loomis', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'first', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Michael', 'troubled', 'child', 'who', 'recollection', 'what', 'done', 'go', 'home', 'be', 'mother', 'time', 'passes', 'Michael', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'shell', 'wearing', 'masks', 'constantly', 'soon', 'again', 'More', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'Michael', 'back', 'Haddonfield', 'claim', 'last', 'victim', 'young', 'sister', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'who', 'was', 'adopted', 'Michael', 'earlier', 'killing', 'spree.The', 'events', 'point', 'unfold', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'did', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'Halloween', 'are', 'subtle', 'differences', 'most', 'part', 'Zombie', 'original', 'very', 'closely', 'end', 'very', 'different', 'original.I', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Carpenter', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'how', 'version', 'compared', 'earlier', 'ones', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Zombie', 'film', 'What', 'liked', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'look', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'early', 'life', 'how', 'became', 'madman', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'beginning', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'where', 'viewer', 'only', 'Michael', 'killing', 'sister', 'Zombie', 'almost', 'hour', 'film', 'time', 'setting', 'stage', 'Michael', 'slide', 'troubled', 'child', 'maniacal', 'killer', 'also', 'viewer', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'sympathetic', 'Michael', 'due', 'troubled', 'upbringing', 'mom', 'who', 'stripper', 'deadbeat', 'boyfriend.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'very', 'highly', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'taken', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'reworked', 'way', 'make', 'almost', 'better', 'original', 'still', 'prefer', 'Carpenter', 'version', 'Zombie', 'scary', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching']",Halloween

1102535,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000VKL6Z2,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[8, 11]","The opening of the film is clever and deals with the events leading up to Michael's first murder. I was very happy with the back story of Michael Myers & how brutal his life was & you could almost see day by day how he was driven to kill almost his entire family.Minor details that were simply Rob Zombie's way of putting his mark on the film include a white trash family that Michael allegedly comes from (even though in the original his mother and father seem to be pretty straight-laced, almost nerdy, people) and the fact that his mother is a stripper. Dr. Loomis is introduced early on, in the film, at Michael's school after some questionable things he done. I just feel that there was enough of a set up in the original John Carpenter film for Zombie to build off of, without going and adding the trashy nature of Michael's family and sympathy we are supposed to feel for him. On top of that it was great to see inside Smith Grove as well - Dr Loomis was far better in this version - although the original is a classic this version had a lot more depth & rather intense ending.Now, even though the film begins in 1963 and then flashes forward 15 years to the night Michael escapes and returns to Haddonfield. Why, then, do the characters have cell phones and are there 1993 Ford Mustangs along the streets of Haddonfield? To me, this just makes the film seem sloppy and badly imagined. If you are going to take the time to ""re-imagine"" a film that is as iconic and famous as Halloween, these should be obvious things to deal with.The ""chase"" scenes are well staged and Zombie throws in some decent scenarios not found in the original. The climax is an entertaining combination of classic 80's style horror where you are screaming at the female lead for being so dense and modern horror grisliness where you feel sick to your stomach after enduring it.This film did go well with me and my biggest complaint, however, is with the sloppiness of the time difference in events. Aside from that Zombie's ""Halloween"" is a calculated gamble to add to these sequels, and it does pay off in the end, ""Halloween"" is perfectly watchable for any horror buffs so if you haven't seen it yet take the time to see it this month.",3,"3.5--Yes, I'm a fan of the original yet this has also gotten my attention",1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,2218,"['opening', 'film', 'clever', 'deals', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'Michael', 'first', 'murder', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'back', 'story', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'how', 'brutal', 'life', 'was', 'could', 'almost', 'see', 'day', 'day', 'how', 'was', 'driven', 'kill', 'almost', 'entire', 'family.Minor', 'details', 'were', 'simply', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'way', 'putting', 'mark', 'film', 'include', 'white', 'trash', 'family', 'Michael', 'allegedly', 'even', 'original', 'mother', 'father', 'seem', 'be', 'pretty', 'straight-laced', 'almost', 'nerdy', 'people', 'fact', 'mother', 'stripper', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'introduced', 'early', 'film', 'Michael', 'school', 'questionable', 'things', 'done', 'just', 'feel', 'was', 'enough', 'set', 'up', 'original', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'Zombie', 'build', 'going', 'adding', 'trashy', 'nature', 'Michael', 'family', 'sympathy', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'top', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'Smith', 'Grove', 'as', 'well', 'Dr', 'Loomis', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'version', 'original', 'classic', 'version', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'depth', 'rather', 'intense', 'ending.Now', 'even', 'film', '1963', 'then', 'flashes', 'forward', '15', 'years', 'night', 'Michael', 'escapes', 'returns', 'Haddonfield', 'Why', 'then', 'do', 'characters', 'have', 'cell', 'phones', 'are', 'there', '1993', 'Ford', 'Mustangs', 'streets', 'Haddonfield', 'just', 'film', 'seem', 'sloppy', 'badly', 'imagined', 'are', 'going', 'take', 'time', 're-imagine', 'film', 'iconic', 'famous', 'Halloween', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'things', 'deal', 'with.The', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'staged', 'Zombie', 'decent', 'scenarios', 'not', 'found', 'original', 'climax', 'entertaining', 'combination', 'classic', '80', 'style', 'horror', 'where', 'are', 'screaming', 'female', 'lead', 'being', 'so', 'dense', 'modern', 'horror', 'grisliness', 'where', 'feel', 'sick', 'stomach', 'enduring', 'it.This', 'film', 'did', 'go', 'well', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'however', 'sloppiness', 'time', 'difference', 'events', 'Aside', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'calculated', 'gamble', 'add', 'sequels', 'pay', 'off', 'end', 'Halloween', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'horror', 'buffs', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'take', 'time', 'see', 'month']",Halloween
1102536,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B000VKL6Z2,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[23, 33]","Director Rob Zombie shows us in his remake of the classic, Halloween, how to grab the money and run.First of all, you don't want to create anything fresh or original--like the original ""Halloween, ""Alien,"" ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" etc. You can always remake a third-rate Asian horror import because all the special effects you need are to slap white make-up on the faces of Asian kids, pile on black mascara and make them bulge their eyes and grit their teeth. Or, you can make the l5th or 20th sequel to a once brilliant original like ""Saw"". Or, you can just go back to the original classic--in this case ""Halloween""--and know that you'll be guaranteed tons of free buzz on the internet. The younger movie buffs who never saw the original will be guaranteed to fill up the seats for this much ballyhooed remake.In this remake, Zombie has trashed everything that made the original so treasured by its fans. Instead of likeable, suburban characters, who wore attractive clothes and seemed to be fond of each other, he gives us a world of sleazy, repulsive jerks who engender no sympathy from the audience. Michael Myers, terrifying and mysterious, in the original, is now a towering, seven foot gorilla. In fact, the first hour of this travesty is spent studying the evolution of Myers from moon-faced idiot to his adult monsterhood. His step-father is a human monster, disguised as red-neck nutjob, his sister is a skanky, hard-faced idiot and his mother, a stripper, is so weak-minded in her love for her little monster, that you care nothing about their fates.Just as bad is the casting of the youngsters. Jaime Lee Curtis was completely likable and sympathetic, as the sweet, naive young girl. Although her two girlfriends were more frisky, you still liked them, too. Also, they all wore attractive clothes. In the remake, the girls live in their boring jeans and tennis shoes and sweatshirts. They look no different from the other colorless clones you see at a mall. Show them a skirt or a dress and they'd probably scratch their heads and go, ""Duh, what's dat?""There's a total lack of suspense as Michael Myers becomes the destroyer. You see him too much, for one thing, and his William Shatner white mask becomes boring. When he removes it, you see a good-looking young guy with stringy hair but with neatly manicured fingers. He trashes rooms and murders everyone in his path until finally, you're yawning and glancing at the clock and thinking: how much longer is going to continue. The original used a brilliant musical score, composed by the movie's director, John Carpenter. The music is an integral part to the original's greatness. It was used sparingly or brilliantly and greatly enhanced the sheer fear. In this remake, it's thrown in from the very beginning until you forget you're even listening to it.The new Laurie spends the entire seond half of the movies shrieking non-stop, screaming and weeping and gibbering. If I was trying to escape from a killer, I think I'd be as quiet as possible and save my breath. In her boring jeans and tennis shoes and sweater and ugly glasses, she's as dull and forgettable as her mall buddies.Equally irritating is the way the girls try to be playful and talk funny by swallowing their words and going nasal and gooching each other.  They're always trying to act scary by fluttering their fingers and disguising their voices to sound scary.Although the original featured some nudity, Zombie wallows in it--female, that is, although you never see any male nudity. The girls are hard, snarling, tough and repellant. It's not the fault of the performers. They all try hard. It's the way they're directed that drains them of any likablity or audience identification. Even the first scene where we see Laurie and her parents over the breakfast table is ruined when Laurie makes a sexual joke using a finger and a bagel. Why?

Also, Zombie has some creepyscenes with respect to the budding superhuman psychopath who goes by the name of Michael Myers: Loomis' black and white tapes (Malcolm McDowell is completely wasted in this role) where a young Myers wears demented masks, descending further and further into psychosis and rage.  That's about the only chill you're gonna find in this movie.The rest is just typical Rob Zombie fare.  Young women bruised and bloody, screaming in pain, sociopathic trailer trash descending further and further into hopelessness, and scene after scene of depraved brutality for brutality's sake.You almost get the feeling that Zombie is parodying the original: Malcolm McDowell actually hosts a college lecture on guess what, folks? ""The Devil's Eyes""!  Would that have anything to do with the lines Donald Pleasance rasped (effectively) about Myers' in the first film?  And hey, Brad Dourif is the sherrif!  Otis is the graveyard keeper for Haddonfield!Udo Keir is in the movie for about five seconds!  Wow!Oh, and we get treated to about fifteen minutes of a young Michael killing some mice.  Thanks, Rob.That disturbing, unnameable, mysterious atmosphere in the original is replaced by mere slasher fare.  I have to admit that I really don't get what people are out to get with respect to Zombie as a filmmaker.  All he does is imitate classic grindhouse flicks of the 70's to very little effect.

Unfortunately, I went and saw the movie...For one, ALL of the characters have abnormally filthy mouths.  Even Laurie had a filthy mouth, which made it very hard to think of her as a victim I'd want to survive.Secondly, I don't need a lengthy biography on Michael.  I wish they'd just leave at him being a born sociopath.  Instead they made it due to child abuse and being picked on in school.  What was interesting in the first one was when the parents run up to Michael after he's stabbed Judith to death and the parents look completely normal; their son is just crazy.  Also in this remake here, Judith was an awful person and I was completely apathetic to her death.  In fact, she pretty much deserved.  I prefer innocent victims.Rob Zombie knows how to create an awesome atmosphere, but he should NOT write his own scripts.  He makes his characters so hard to like and they all have mouths like a bunch of uneducated trash.Apparently a lot of people enjoyed this movie, but I hated every single character and basically sided with Michael despite how much I already hated his character.

Hirth,"[7, 9]","Everyone is a critic and everyone can argue until the sun explodes about what's good and what's bad about this remake, or just remakes in general.Just to start off, I am both a classic horror fan and a Rob Zombie fan, so I might be biased or not, whatever.I generally don't like the idea of remakes because usually there is nothing that needs to be retold from the original story that could be done in a better way.I hate when I hear there is a remake of (insert whatever title here) coming out.Not because they are doing their own version of the story but because I already know whats going to happen to begin with.However, a remake like this comes along and was a surprise to me.It was actually better than I thought it would be, even though I had already enjoyed Rob's other gruesome films.This was his first (and besides the sequel, maybe last?) stab at something he did not create himself.But I am happy that Rob was chosen, simply because he is a fan of the original and had a clue as to what the fans might like or dislike.If you want the original (which is an all-time classic in every sense of the word) then go watch that one, because this is different.Rob knew that the only thing in the first two films that were left un-explored, was how/why Michael Myers ended up as a serial killer.Some say it takes away from the mystery but not for me, because there is still mystery there to be found.Why did he stop speaking?How was he able to survive at the end, after being shot multiple times at point blank range?What about the sequel and his psychic connection with his sister?My view is that after he snapped, he kind of opened himself up to whatever dark forces wanted him.There is no CGI mask, and no kung-fu hip-hop karate action in this one, which is a great relief.Some complain that the murder scenes are too violent, but this is a film about a sadistic serial killer, so what do you expect?Can we go back in time and ask Jack the Ripper to tone it down a bit?This is fiction but it's very realistic and for some, unsettling.It could have turned out much, much worse.I can't make anyone love this and I can't make anyone hate it, that's all up to you.I love the original with all my horror-fan heart and I think this is one of the best remakes ever done.John Carpenter's version will never be replaced and I see this version as a companion to that.But if you think this film is too bloody or gory, you should read the news more often because reality is far more brutal.And if you do find that you enjoy this sort of thing, it doesn't mean you are sick in the head.It just means you enjoy a good horror movie.Also one last thing, I have to say that the characters were much more interesting in this version than the original.Like I said, I love the original but the characters this time around seem to have more personality.But don't take my word for it, see for yourself and be the judge.Happy Halloween!",4,Might as well add my two cents to the

1102541,A3RB6NQOLOBXYD,B000VKL6Z2,"Jimmy Lee ""James""","[4, 7]","Upon the anticipation of one of my favorite holidays, I felt it was necessary, if not crucial to dabble in some suspenseful and horrifying cinema this week. The suspense, or lack thereof, mostly resulted into a depressing and horrific cinematic experience. It was so horrifying to see a remake fail in all aspects, visually and cinematically that I could almost hear John Carpenter's hair turn whiter as he chain-smokes his last and final cigarette.The truth is I happen to be a fan of Rob Zombie's previous films; moreover, I appreciated his passion for cult horror movies that sometimes incorporated the sort of nostalgic drive-in movie era. Upon hearing a remake of Carpenter's classic, I became annoyed and disappointed at first, but was soon relieved to find out it was someone not only worthy of creativity but truly passionate about these type of slasher films that Zombie cares about so much. Boy, was I profoundly disappointed in Zombie's ""re-imaging"" of Halloween, or shall I call it a sheer massacre.For the first 45-50 minutes of the film, We get a lengthy and interminable back round of Michael's Myer's psychology; the rationale; he comes from a broken home with a mother who strips late night to make ends meet, a dead-beat father figure who incessantly call his boy, ""faget"", and an uncaring older sister who is about as uninteresting as the film. At school, it is no different as Michael endures a myriad of tortures from school bullies who appear about as non-threatening as a senile old lady. The young boy playing Michael Myer's childhood was disturbing in the sense that he was scarier looking without the mask as his girlish blonde hair, pre-adolescent chubby face and crooked teeth rendered him retarded looking. The bottom line is that Rob Zombie's approach into making Michael Myer's character more sympathetic to the audience truly defies John Carpenter's intentions. I honestly loathed the weak climatic build up of Michael Myer's mental breakdown if you could call it that; personally it looked like a rebellious pre-pubescent hissy fit. It was a tough pill to swallow to take Myer's childhood seriously and even more so when he's battering his sister's boyfriend brains with a baseball bat, or slitting William Forsythe's throat. Even Malcolm Mcdowell's psychological evaluation of Michael Myer's meltdown in the mental institution came off as incredibly corny adding entirely no substance to the film; it was uninformative and just plain boring. I just hope they paid Mcdowell a pretty penny to waste his valuable acting skills on this film, but that is beside the point.After the long introduction horror fans of the genre finally get to see the true modern Michael Myer's we've been waiting for, the result, a 280 lb. 6'8 gorilla. Hey who would of thought Michael Meyer's physique would mimic an NFL coaches wet dream. This is another problem I had with this film, Rob Zombie thought it was necessary to seriously upgrade Myer's physique, bad idea... what were they feeding this kid at the mental institution, HGH and testosterone! His figure looks overbearing in the film to the point where his on-screen presence looks inhuman and far too dominating as his broad shoulders and towering height look more like a Caterpillar bulldozer at a construction site. In all seriousness, I had difficulty deciphering whether Myer's was suffering from middle-child syndrome or exhibiting symptoms of roid rage, which is probably the only mysterious enigma about Myer's Psychology in the entire film. Personally, I thought what made Carpenter's Myer's more frightening is that he appeared more average and less animated. It was his slow but persevering amble that gave me the chills, not a fast over dominating beast that broke through every door and main beam in that house. It was ridiculous and nauseating to witness Zombie's over extended chase scenes that really amounted to sheer emptiness and dissatisfaction in the end. In other words, the pay-off sucked big time. The editing overall was pretty weak as well, a few interesting wide-angle shots in the mental institution accompanied by more mundane uninteresting chase scenes. Rob Zombie also upgrades the violence as well but it fails miserably to compensate for the lack of suspense. As a result, the violence comes off as incredibly gratuitous and unwarranted. However, I cannot bash the nudity even though it delivered the same unjustified result as the violence. It was almost as if Robb Zombie was forcing the nudity as if saying, ""I can show bush in my Halloween and get away with it"".Despite my criticism, there are some few and sparse redeeming qualities such as the authenticity of recapturing the 1970's feel which Rob Zombie subtlety recaptures and manages to weave into the film. Sheri Moon Zombie actually pulls it off kind of nicely, maybe it was her carefully selected wardrobe or her soft dirty blonde hair, couldn't tell you but her looks worked for the time being. Her acting is another story, I won't go there, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say its serviceable at best. Rob Zombie throws in some 70's one hit wonders, some Blue oyster Cult, which is also featured in Carpenter's version when Jamie Lee Curtis is driving with PJ Soles, Rush and Nazareth. The only interesting relationship I found was that between Dr. Loomis and Michael Myers in the mental institution and Sid Haig's quick cameo, other than that the character development was extremely weak leaving me disconnected from relating to anybody.I did get through most of the bonus features and even some of that 4  hour documentary. There are some interesting bonus features, just about enough to last you through next Halloween. Horror Fans will enjoy the 2nd disc with interviews and behind the scenes, along with a 3rd disc step by step ""making of documentary of the entire movie. Despite Rob Zombie's catastrophic reimaging of a Horror classic, I have to applaud his audaciousness for actually exposing how he screwed up a classic in the infamous 4  documentary. But seriously, it is interesting to see how a film is made and how frustrating it is to meet deadlines, deal with actors, prop sets you name it. There is a great deal patience and articulation in respect to guiding your actors, script and photography.  The film is certainly not a good remake, more like horrendous but the bonus features can keep you occupied for a bit if your interested in making films.",2,"A quick, sloppy cash in for the novice

The body count increased incredibly in this remake. I can't even count how many people died in the movie.The movie is creepy and scary and despite how awfully violent it is I couldn't keep my eyes off it. I might need therapy for that reason though. This is probably the most insane movie I have seen, well next to Devil's Rejects anyway. Rob Zombie is a good director but.....the movie is a bit over done. We didn't need the body count to be even bigger this time around.Seeing person after person die brutally tends to get tiresome and hard to watch and it even holds the movie down from being great. There's a little too many un-needed killings in the movie. Rob Zombie went all out when he really didn't have to. He loses focus on the main story by having sooo many side characters brutally murdered.The movie is gripping especially at the end but the beginning drags on too long and is a bit depressing despite a creepy performance by the kid who plays young Michael. Sarah Moon also does good work as his mother and you feel bad for her since she clearly loves her child who broke her heart by going all psycho. Rob Zombie pulls off giving us a film that's a bit different, so if you are avoiding it because you feel as if you seen it already, don't avoid it for that reason. You might want to avoid it due to being so over the top violent though.",3,A disturbing and brutally violent remake......that I sorta liked,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,1471,"['hard', 'recommend', 'new', 'version', 'Halloween', 'brutal', 'disturbing', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'made', 'body', 'count', 'increased', 'incredibly', 'remake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'died', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'creepy', 'scary', 'how', 'awfully', 'violent', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eyes', 'might', 'need', 'therapy', 'reason', 'probably', 'most', 'insane', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'well', 'next', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'anyway', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'good', 'director', '..the', 'movie', 'bit', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'body', 'count', 'be', 'even', 'bigger', 'time', 'around.Seeing', 'person', 'person', 'die', 'brutally', 'get', 'tiresome', 'hard', 'watch', 'even', 'movie', 'down', 'being', 'great', 'little', 'too', 'many', 'un-needed', 'killings', 'movie', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'went', 'out', 'when', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'focus', 'main', 'story', 'having', 'sooo', 'many', 'side', 'characters', 'brutally', 'murdered.The', 'movie', 'gripping', 'especially', 'end', 'beginning', 'drags', 'too', 'long', 'bit', 'depressing', 'creepy', 'performance', 'kid', 'who', 'young', 'Michael', 'Sarah', 'Moon', 'also', 'good', 'work', 'mother', 'feel', 'bad', 'clearly', 'child', 'who', 'broke', 'heart', 'going', 'psycho', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'off', 'giving', 'film', 'bit', 'different', 'so', 'are', 'avoiding', 'feel', 'seen', 'already', 'do', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'reason', 'might', 'want', 'avoid', 'due', 'being', 'so', 'top', 'violent']",Halloween

Lody,"[1, 1]","I once sat in on a theatrical showing of this remake while I was waiting for my intended feature to start, I remember being revolted then, and nothing had changed by the time I tried watching it again. Zombie just is not a good director. His films lack story interest and anything close to a sympathetic character. I myself am not a drunk, a pervert, a stripper or exotic dancer, and I'm not a drug addict or a rapist or a serial murderer. So maybe that's why I have no empathy for any of his characters. They all seem like they were intended as mere psycho-fodder, so where's the drama? The Michael Meyers character especially is neither menacing nor sympathetic. He's just an ugly moon-faced brat who needs 2 in the brainpan. His family and victims all feel like they were destined to be killed in some grisly way that matches their dissolute existence.

1102544,A2XCFRKYV6GAOJ,B000VKL6Z2,J.M.,"[5, 7]","Rob Zombie's Halloween has breathed new life into the series for me.  It is in my opinion, that many people don't like this version of Halloween, simply because it is not the original.  Many people feel as though ""classic"" movies should be left alone.  However, for those who can accept that classics are not some sacred piece of work that can never be touched, this version of Halloween has a lot to offer on its own.Unlike the original Halloween, this version of Halloween gives us some insight into Michael Myers' past, while taking a few liberties from the original.In the original Halloween, it is kind of implied that Michael Myers came from a normal family, and for some unexplained reason he decided to murder his sister.  Then the story fast forwards 15 years.  In Zombie's Halloween, Michael Myers comes from a ""white trash"" dysfunctional family.  His mother is a stripper, his step-father is verbally abusive, and his older sister is neglectful and self-centered.  At school, Myers is bullied by older, bigger students.As the story progresses, we learn that Michael shows some psychopathic symptoms, such as the enjoyment of harming and killing animals while showing no remorse.In this re-imagining of the original, we even get to see Michael during his time in the mental institution, and we witness the character drift further into the ""darkness"" and become more evil.  Another thing I liked, was we get to see how Michael got his mask (we even find out why he wears a mask).  In the original, Michael escapes the mental institution, stole a random mask at a hardware store, and that's that.  In this version of Halloween, the mask actually kind of has a story of its own.Eventually the story essentially picks up where the original Halloween starts, and in fact, many of the scenes are re-created nearly shot for shot.  This has turned off many, but for me, I actually like it.  It kinda brought everything full circle from him being certified into the mental institution, to his escape, and then to where things started in the original Halloween.Many people also didn't like how ""human"" Michael Myers seems in this version of Halloween.  I take what they mean by that is, we know too much of the character.  Where in the original, he was a killer who just kinda showed up out of nowhere and started killing for no apparent reason.  However, I also disagree with this.  In Zombie's Halloween, Michael Myers is scarier than he has ever been.  He is very scary.  For the very fact that there could be a real life ""Michael Myers"" among us.  He isn't just some supernatural killer who only shows up in nightmares.  And he isn't some mindless, unstoppable zombie with a machete.  Michael Myers could be among us.  There could very well be someone who has suffered severe trauma at some point in life, who is being consumed by emotional darkness.  Hopefully not, but the possibly is could very easily happen.Overall, if your a purist, then this movie will only disappoint.  However, if you like Halloween, but can accept that this movie is a new movie, not a sequel to the last Halloween, and not meant to be a direct re-make of the original, then this movie should be pleasantly entertaining. I consider it the best of the Halloween movies so far.",5,Great Re-Imagining to a Classic Horror,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,3256,"['Rob', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'breathed', 'new', 'life', 'series', 'opinion', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'version', 'Halloween', 'simply', 'not', 'original', 'Many', 'people', 'feel', 'classic', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'However', 'who', 'can', 'accept', 'classics', 'are', 'not', 'sacred', 'piece', 'work', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'touched', 'version', 'Halloween', 'lot', 'offer', 'original', 'Halloween', 'version', 'Halloween', 'insight', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'past', 'taking', 'few', 'liberties', 'original.In', 'original', 'Halloween', 'kind', 'implied', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'came', 'normal', 'family', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'decided', 'murder', 'sister', 'Then', 'story', 'fast', 'forwards', '15', 'years', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'white', 'trash', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'mother', 'stripper', 'step-father', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'older', 'sister', 'neglectful', 'self-centered', 'school', 'Myers', 'bullied', 'older', 'bigger', 'students.As', 'story', 'learn', 'Michael', 'psychopathic', 'symptoms', 'such', 'enjoyment', 'harming', 'killing', 'animals', 'showing', 'remorse.In', 're-imagining', 'original', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'Michael', 'time', 'mental', 'institution', 'witness', 'character', 'drift', 'further', 'darkness', 'become', 'more', 'evil', 'thing', 'liked', 'was', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Michael', 'got', 'mask', 'even', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'mask', 'original', 'Michael', 'mental', 'institution', 'stole', 'random', 'mask', 'hardware', 'store', 'version', 'Halloween', 'mask', 'actually', 'kind', 'story', 'own.Eventually', 'story', 'essentially', 'up', 'where', 'original', 'Halloween', 'starts', 'fact', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 're-created', 'nearly', 'shot', 'shot', 'turned', 'off', 'many', 'actually', 'kinda', 'brought', 'everything', 'full', 'circle', 'being', 'certified', 'mental', 'institution', 'escape', 'then', 'where', 'things', 'started', 'original', 'Halloween.Many', 'people', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'human', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'version', 'Halloween', 'take', 'what', 'mean', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'character', 'Where', 'original', 'was', 'killer', 'who', 'just', 'kinda', 'showed', 'nowhere', 'started', 'killing', 'apparent', 'reason', 'However', 'also', 'disagree', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'scarier', 'ever', 'been', 'very', 'scary', 'very', 'fact', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'Michael', 'Myers', ""n't"", 'just', 'supernatural', 'killer', 'who', 'only', 'up', 'nightmares', ""n't"", 'mindless', 'unstoppable', 'zombie', 'machete', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'could', 'be', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'suffered', 'severe', 'trauma', 'point', 'life', 'who', 'being', 'consumed', 'emotional', 'darkness', 'Hopefully', 'not', 'possibly', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'happen.Overall', 'purist', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'only', 'disappoint', 'However', 'like', 'Halloween', 'can', 'accept', 'movie', 'new', 'movie', 'not', 'sequel', 'last', 'Halloween', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'direct', 're-make', 'original', 'then', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'entertaining', 'consider', 'best', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'so', 'far']",Halloween

1102546,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B000VKL6Z2,Joe Carugati,"[1, 4]","As you can see from the title of this review, I called it ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"", because no matter how much resemblances there are between Zombie's and Carpenter's vision, both films are drastically different.  In other words, John Carpenter's is still a better film.I'm not sure exactly what to think of this film. As much as I love Michael Myers, I really didn't need any story on how he actually became the killer he was.  The beauty of the original is that there was no motive for what he is doing.  He was raised in a nice, quiet neighborhood with his loving family.  When he snaps then, it makes it all the more terrifying and the audience questions why he does things he does.In this version, his family are a bunch of grungy, profanity-spewing pigs.  They are not loving or caring (except for the mother) and in a way, we sympathize with Michael as a child.  Plus, the lead up to the killings, which start his path towards violence forever, is filled with Nazareth's ""Love Hurts"" playing in the background as Michael thinks about his Mom stripping at a club (Is this Halloween?  Am I watching a different movie?).  Anyway, it seems like Michael just gets bored on Halloween night and kills his family members.  There's no mystery whatsoever.  He just picks up a knife because he has nothing better to do.Rob Zombie does a good job of moving the story along at a brisk pace, but that's also his downfall.  As soon as we're introduced to Laurie and her friends, they are killed 10 minutes after. Actually, a lot of people are introduced and then killed two seconds later. In the original, time (a lot of time) was spent on the girls and even though you may have been bored because of it, you at least cared when they were killed. Not so much here.There were a few high points though. The direction by Zombie was pretty good and managed to get some good scares out of me.  Yet, I wanted more suspense-filled moments (no more of these jump scares) like the original.  There needed to be more stalking of the victims and less killing.In the acting department, props to Scout Taylor-Compton, who I thought actually did BETTER than Jamie Lee Curtis. I know people are going to hate on me for that, but I found her much more believable and wanted her to live. Malcolm McDowell did an adequate job as Loomis, but he's no Donald Pleasance.  Some of his lines felt very forced and unintentionally funny.  Tyler Mane did a great job as Michael in my opinion.  Too bad that we had to see him as a child as it lessened the image of him.  Regardless, he was a brute, menacing, and had a great aura about him.Overall, it was a good horror movie. I just wish more time was devoted to the victims than the actual killer. It would have made for a much better (and scarier) ride.",3,Rob Zombie's Halloween,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,2770,"['can', 'see', 'title', 'review', 'called', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'resemblances', 'are', 'Zombie', 'Carpenter', 'vision', 'films', 'are', 'drastically', 'different', 'other', 'words', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'still', 'better', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'think', 'film', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'story', 'how', 'actually', 'became', 'killer', 'was', 'beauty', 'original', 'was', 'motive', 'what', 'doing', 'was', 'raised', 'nice', 'quiet', 'neighborhood', 'loving', 'family', 'When', 'then', 'more', 'terrifying', 'audience', 'questions', 'why', 'things', 'version', 'family', 'are', 'bunch', 'grungy', 'profanity-spewing', 'pigs', 'are', 'not', 'loving', 'caring', 'mother', 'way', 'sympathize', 'Michael', 'child', 'lead', 'up', 'killings', 'path', 'towards', 'violence', 'forever', 'filled', 'Nazareth', 'Love', 'Hurts', 'playing', 'background', 'Michael', 'Mom', 'stripping', 'club', 'Halloween', 'Am', 'watching', 'different', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'Michael', 'just', 'bored', 'Halloween', 'night', 'kills', 'family', 'members', 'mystery', 'whatsoever', 'just', 'up', 'knife', 'nothing', 'better', 'do.Rob', 'Zombie', 'good', 'job', 'moving', 'story', 'along', 'brisk', 'pace', 'also', 'downfall', 'As', 'soon', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Laurie', 'friends', 'are', 'killed', '10', 'minutes', 'Actually', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'introduced', 'then', 'killed', 'two', 'seconds', 'later', 'original', 'time', 'lot', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'girls', 'even', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bored', 'least', 'cared', 'when', 'were', 'killed', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'here.There', 'were', 'few', 'high', 'points', 'direction', 'Zombie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'managed', 'get', 'good', 'scares', 'wanted', 'more', 'suspense-filled', 'moments', 'more', 'jump', 'scares', 'original', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'stalking', 'victims', 'less', 'killing.In', 'acting', 'department', 'props', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'who', 'thought', 'actually', 'did', 'BETTER', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'found', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'wanted', 'live', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'did', 'adequate', 'job', 'Loomis', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'lines', 'felt', 'very', 'forced', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Michael', 'opinion', 'Too', 'bad', 'had', 'see', 'child', 'lessened', 'image', 'Regardless', 'was', 'brute', 'menacing', 'had', 'great', 'aura', 'him.Overall', 'was', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'just', 'wish', 'more', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'victims', 'actual', 'killer', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'scarier', 'ride']",Halloween

He escapes from the mental ward to find his long lost little sister Laurie Strode (Scout-Taylor Compton) as he kills people in his way for now Dr. Loomis must try to stop him from killing anyone.Enjoyable revamp of the Halloween franchise that started with the 1978 slasher landmark from John Carpenter. Fans cried blasphemy when they heard this was gonna be remade but Rob Zombie who is a hardcore fan of the original and whom helmed the underrated ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and the brilliant ""Devil's Rejects"" went to save the franchise after it became a joke of itself no thanks to ""Halloween Resurrection"" with Busta Rhymes ruining the film. Although he had no intention to make a full remake like the horrible ""Psycho"" remake from 1998 he wanted to make a prequel and a reinvention of the original movie that honors John Carpenter's masterpiece. The film does co-star Ken Foree, Sid Haig, Brad Douriff, Bill Moseley, Danny Trejo, Danielle Harris, Dee Wallace Stone, Clint Howard, Udo Kier, and Sybil Danning as this film does give an interesting extended history of Michael Myers and how he had a dysfunctional family. I know some fans of the original Halloween are kind of disgusted with the new Myers being a ""Married with Children"" kind of trashy family. There is some brutal gory violence making this the goriest Halloween movie since ""Halloween 2"" in 1981, though it does miss out on the original bloodless scares that made the original movie a classic this one goes for bloody action like some of the Halloween sequels. Though it is very entertaining but can never replace the original classic as that was not the intention that Rob Zombie did for he just wanted to re-establish the franchise.This 2-Disc collector's Edition blu-ray offers stunning picture and sound with the unrated director's cut of the film with more character development and violence that were cut out to avoid an NC-17 rating. The extras include Audio commentary, a 2 hour documentary that goes behind the scenes of this reimagining, featurettes, deleted scenes and alternate ending with select commentary, Screen tests, interviews, BD-Live and Trailer.",4,A nice revamp of the John Carpenter classic!,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,2974,"['Sixteen', 'years', 'ago', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Daeg', 'Faerch', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'stepfather', 'Ronnie', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'drunk', 'redneck', 'who', 'kind', 'abuses', 'young', 'boy', 'sexy', 'stripper', 'mother', 'Debroah', 'Sherri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'stepsister', 'named', 'Judith', 'Hanna', 'Hall', 'baby', 'sister', 'named', 'Laurie', 'gotten', 'rotten', 'horrific', 'behaviors', 'including', 'killing', 'animals', 'even', 'killed', 'few', 'school', 'bullies', 'picked', 'did', 'however', 'murdered', 'big', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'Ronnie', 'creating', 'one', 'Haddonfield', 'most', 'brutal', 'crimes', 'ever', 'convicted', 'guilty', 'murder', 'first', 'degree', 'psychiatric', 'care', 'daily', 'care', 'child', 'psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Sam', 'Loomis', 'Michael', 'Mcdowell', 'years', 'later', 'grown', 'up', 'hulking', 'mute', 'man', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'Michael', 'face', 'various', 'masks', 'mental', 'ward', 'find', 'long', 'lost', 'little', 'sister', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'Scout-Taylor', 'Compton', 'people', 'way', 'now', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'must', 'try', 'stop', 'killing', 'anyone.Enjoyable', 'revamp', 'Halloween', 'franchise', 'started', '1978', 'slasher', 'landmark', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Fans', 'cried', 'blasphemy', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'remade', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'who', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'original', 'whom', 'helmed', 'underrated', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', 'brilliant', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'went', 'save', 'franchise', 'became', 'joke', 'thanks', 'Halloween', 'Resurrection', 'Busta', 'Rhymes', 'ruining', 'film', 'had', 'intention', 'make', 'full', 'remake', 'horrible', 'Psycho', 'remake', '1998', 'wanted', 'make', 'prequel', 'reinvention', 'original', 'movie', 'honors', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'co-star', 'Ken', 'Foree', 'Sid', 'Haig', 'Brad', 'Douriff', 'Bill', 'Moseley', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'Stone', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'Udo', 'Kier', 'Sybil', 'Danning', 'film', 'give', 'interesting', 'extended', 'history', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'how', 'had', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'know', 'fans', 'original', 'Halloween', 'are', 'kind', 'disgusted', 'new', 'Myers', 'being', 'Married', 'Children', 'kind', 'trashy', 'family', 'brutal', 'gory', 'violence', 'making', 'goriest', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'Halloween', '2', '1981', 'miss', 'out', 'original', 'bloodless', 'scares', 'made', 'original', 'movie', 'classic', 'one', 'bloody', 'action', 'Halloween', 'sequels', 'very', 'entertaining', 'can', 'never', 'replace', 'original', 'classic', 'was', 'not', 'intention', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'did', 'just', 'wanted', 're-establish', 'franchise.This', '2-Disc', 'collector', 'Edition', 'blu-ray', 'offers', 'stunning', 'picture', 'sound', 'unrated', 'director', 'cut', 'film', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'violence', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'avoid', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'extras', 'include', 'Audio', 'commentary', '2', 'hour', 'documentary', 'scenes', 'reimagining', 'featurettes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'select', 'commentary', 'Screen', 'tests', 'interviews', 'BD-Live', 'Trailer']",Halloween

Well, after seeing it...I have to tell ya, Rob didn't hit a home run but his new vision and re-telling of Carpenter's ""classic"" Halloween is a solid hit. He stuck to the basic story and plot (rearranged some things) and completely re-vamped Halloween into something much better (he got rid of allot of the hokeyness that was in the original). While not perfect (I had an issue with the ""time line"") I can look past that one discrepancy, it played out much smoother and with less down time.Zombie's version of Halloween is far more violent and shows much more graphic detail. I liked the back story that gave you a better glimpse to how Michael Meyers came to be and the meaning behind ""the mask"". Halloween purists will argue that Zombie revealed too much by giving too much away and spending too much time on other details. Those are the minute minority that are just hung up on Carpenter's classic and are unwilling to accept a new version of the film.You can't compare the two films. While similar in character and plot, they are completely two different animals. Carpenter's Halloween will always be the ""cult classic"" and what Zombie was attempting to do (and executed well) was make it ""his film"". Doing a complete carbon copy of the original would have been pointless and an insult to the original. I'm glad that Zombie manned up and took the reins on this one giving it quite a different look and feel. Dirty, gritty, cruel and ferocious to the end. Zombie's vision of Halloween will keep your attention from start to finish. I liked it so much that I broke down and bought the DVD, it is well worth watching and owning and great film for a Halloween night tradition.",4,"""Michael Meyers was created by a perfect alignment of interior and exterior factors gone violently wrong.

Just some thoughts on this remake of John Carpenter's 1978 classic...Halloween (2007) is a remake (yes, a REMAKE) of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), a classic of the horror genre.  Rob Zombie decided he wanted to remake Carpenter's classic and he turned it into an all-out gore fest that leaves nothing to the imagination.  We see lots of brutal killings, lots of nudity, and worst of all, Zombie gives a back story on Michael Myers which explains why he ended up being a killing machine.  I thought Michael Myers is the boogeyman.  The boogeyman shouldn't have a back story.  There shouldn't be any explanation of why Myers ends up a mass murderer.  When an explanation is given, it makes the viewer think, &#34;Well, this guy is just a typical serial killer, nothing unique about him.&#34;  It totally destroys any mystery about the boogeyman/Michael Myers.  In the original movie, Myers was a guy with a playful side and we didn't know too much about him, other than that he escaped from a mental institution.This movie doesn't do it for me.  The only decent thing about this movie is the autumn/Halloween atmosphere, which is a big improvement over the original, but that's it.  I added one star because of this.There shouldn't have ever been a remake done.Grade: D+",2,I'll stick with the original,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,1331,"['description', 'plot', 'etc.', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'Just', 'thoughts', 'remake', 'John', 'Carpenter', '1978', 'classic', 'Halloween', '2007', 'remake', 'yes', 'REMAKE', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Halloween', '1978', 'classic', 'horror', 'genre', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'decided', 'wanted', 'remake', 'Carpenter', 'classic', 'turned', 'all-out', 'gore', 'fest', 'nothing', 'imagination', 'see', 'lots', 'brutal', 'killings', 'lots', 'nudity', 'worst', 'Zombie', 'back', 'story', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'why', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'killing', 'machine', 'thought', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'boogeyman', 'boogeyman', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'back', 'story', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'explanation', 'why', 'Myers', 'up', 'mass', 'murderer', 'When', 'explanation', 'given', 'viewer', 'think', '34', 'Well', 'guy', 'just', 'typical', 'serial', 'killer', 'nothing', 'unique', 'him.', '34', 'totally', 'mystery', 'boogeyman/Michael', 'Myers', 'original', 'movie', 'Myers', 'was', 'guy', 'playful', 'side', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'too', 'much', 'other', 'escaped', 'mental', 'institution.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'only', 'decent', 'thing', 'movie', 'autumn/Halloween', 'atmosphere', 'big', 'improvement', 'original', 'added', 'one', 'star', 'this.There', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'remake', 'done.Grade', 'D+']",Halloween
1102552,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B000VKL6Z2,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[2, 2]","The original ""Halloween"" from 1978 was a great horror flick, a classic that hasn't been topped by any of the numerous sequels and clones that have followed. So what is there to do besides making another pointless sequel? Do a remake. And that's exactly what writer/director Rob Zombie did by redoing a new take on the horror classic. This time around Zombie decided to go back to the series' roots by showing new stuff that wasn't featured in the original. For example, we saw Michael Myers as a child killing his older sister in the first five minutes of the original film. At the beginning of this new movie, this time we see more of Michael as a child and how he slowly begins to turn to the dark side as he begins his killing spree on Halloween. The midway point of the film shows more scenes of Michael at the mental sanitarium, which of course he eventually breaks out of. And the last half features Michael heading back to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois.I haven't seen Rob Zombie's two previous movies (""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"") so going into this new ""Halloween"" movie I had no idea what kind of films this guy made. And judging by the opening scenes, I thought I was going to hate this film. We're not only introduced to Michael Myers as a kid, but we're also introduced to his family, and a happy family it ain't. The other members of the Myers household are Michael's mother Deborah, who works as a stripper; Michael's sister Judith, who's a sex-obsessed slut; and Michael's mother's boyfriend Ronnie, who's an abusive jerk. Oh and I almost forgot, there's Michael's baby sister, who will grow up to be Laurie Strode. These beginning scenes are so downright ugly that I found myself laughing at what was going on. This is true of that kitchen scene where Deborah and Ronnie are arguing and Ronnie loud angry tone causes Michael's baby sister to start crying not once, not twice, but three times! But then a funny thing happened while I was watching. The movie started to get interesting and I found myself more involved with the backstory of Michael Myers. The first half of the movie works best because it's the part that we hadn't really seen before in the earlier ""Halloween"" films, while the second half is more familiar territory as Michael (after breaking out of the sanitarium) returns to Haddonfield to claim his sister who's now grown up, and will kill anyone who gets in his way.I was very surprised that I liked this movie as much as I did. It's one of the better horror movie remakes to come out of Hollywood recently, and there have been a lot of horror movie remakes. In the past couple of years we have seen remakes to hit horror movies from the '70s and '80s such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""The Amityville Horror"", ""The Fog"", ""When a Stranger Calls"", and ""The Hills Have Eyes"". And I'm sure there will be more remakes to come (""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" will probably be next). In my opinion, the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake from 2004 is still the best of all of these films. The ""Halloween"" remake from this year follows in second place. Sure Rob Zombie has made a movie that some people will probably describe as trashy. It's graphically violent, very profane, and contains a lot of sexuality/nudity. It's far more violent, profane, and sexual than the original John Carpenter film. But Zombie directs the film with a unique blend of stylishness that I found to be interesting. Plus, he gets some good performances from his cast of actors.There are four performances here that stand out. Malcolm McDowell takes over the role of Dr. Sam Loomis (played by Donald Pleasence in the earlier films), and plays the character differently this time out. In the other ""Halloween"" films, there were times it seemed that the Dr. Loomis character was crazier than Michael Myers (that was especially true in the awful fifth movie). But McDowell plays Dr. Loomis as someone who doesn't act crazy. He's pretty sane, and wants nothing more that to stop the terror that's happening around him. His performance here is pretty good. The best performances are turned in by Sheri Moon Zombie (Rob Zombie's wife in real life) as Michael's mother, and young Daeg Faerch as the 10 year old Michael Myers. I found myself actually caring for these two individuals, and their relationship was very touching despite the evil that lurks around them. And newcomer Scout Taylor-Compton is very good as the new Laurie Strode. She might not top Jamie Lee Curtis, but she's still very effective in the role here. This time out Laurie isn't as uptight as she was in the original. She has some spunk, and I thought that was refreshing. Plus there's some good work done by Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky in the ""Child's Play"" movies) as Haddonfield sheriff Leigh Brackett, Danielle Harris (who played Jamie Lloyd in ""Halloween 4"" and ""Halloween 5"") as Laurie's friend Annie, who's also the sheriff's daughter, and Dee Wallace (the mother from ""E.T."" and ""Cujo"") as Laurie's adoptive mother Cynthia.I did have a few quibbles with this film. I saw this movie when it came out in theaters earlier this year, and after seeing the unrated version on DVD noticed a few differences. For example, the scene where Michael breaks out of the sanitarium is completely different in the unrated version than it was in the theatrical version. Surprisingly, that alternate scene that played in the theatrical version isn't even featured in the DVD extras of this movie. And to tell you the truth, I was a little disappointed by that because I thought the breakout scene that was featured in the theatrical version was better and more effective. The new scene that's featured in the unrated version has a rape sequence that is quite nasty, and I'm guessing Zombie changed it for the theatrical version because if he had put in that scene for the theatrical version, the movie would have gotten an NC-17 rating. I wish Zombie had left that breakout scene the way it was in the theatrical version.Nevertheless, the 2007 remake of ""Halloween"" is still a pretty good one. And the DVD extras are excellent. The bloopers are hilarious, there are plenty of deleted scenes, an alternate ending, casting sessions for many of the young actors who appear in the film, and a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie (which appears in different parts). All-in-all a decent remake.",4,Surprisingly above average remake of a horror classic,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,6434,"['original', 'Halloween', '1978', 'was', 'great', 'horror', 'flick', 'classic',

I love the first ""Halloween"" (I even caught it at a movie theatre where they played it the night before Halloween and the day of) and I love Rob Zombie's previous two movies. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" wasn't very good, but I enjoyed it...And ""The Devil's Rejects"" was one of the best horror films I've ever seen. Zombie's re-imagining of ""Halloween"" sticks close enough to the original store to not upset horror buffs, but puts his own stamp on it at the same time. One thing the film does is delve a bit deeper into the childhood of Michael Myers. The movie opens on Halloween, where we meet the family. Michael's mother (Sheri Moon) is a stripper with an abusive, drunken, crippled boyfriend. He has a baby sister and an older sister and, besides wearing masks constantly appears fairly normal. Well, for two seconds...Until we watch him slaughter his pet rat. Pretty soon, Michael has killed a schoolyard bully and, while his mother is at work, he kills the boyfriend, his sister, and her boyfriend...Leaving only the baby alive. Sent to a mental asylum, Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, who is nice to see in a nice-guy role) is assigned to treat Michael. Pretty soon though, Michael has killed a nurse at the asylum and has withdrawn into his mind...And not long after, his mother commits suicide. 15 years later; Michael escapes from the asylum and decides to try and find his sister. Most of the things that happen after his escape will seem quite familar to watchers of the original film. Zombie did a really great job with this movie. Learning about the Myers character was very interesting and creepy. His casting of McDowell (whom he no doubt cast over his love for ""A Clockwork Orange"") was great, as well as casting Brad Dourif (voice of Chucky) as a cop. The aging of the characters is very well done. When we meet Loomis in the beginning, he looks like a fairly younger guy. 15 years later; Loomis looks like...Well, Malcolm McDowell. ""Halloween"" has it's share of originality on top of the things that were necessary for the remake (i.e., the music). But this is easily the best remake I've seen of a horror film in a good long while. Rob Zombie is a very gifted writer/director (I'm starting to like his movies better than I ever liked his music) and I hope he continues, because this movie already shows that Zombie has created a signature style (listen to the dialogue between Michael's mother and her boyfriend in the beginning of the film). Anyway, as it is a horror film...It's no masterpiece. And it has its share of nudity and violence, but overall...It's a work of art.GRADE: A-",5,One of the Best Horror Remakes Ever!,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,2748,"['Horror', 'fans', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'remake', 'Halloween', 'could', 'quite', 'possibly', 'be', 'better', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'directed', 'original', 'love', 'first', 'Halloween', 'even', 'caught', 'movie', 'theatre', 'where', 'played', 'night', 'Halloween', 'day', 'love', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'previous', 'two', 'movies', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'enjoyed', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Zombie', 're-imagining', 'Halloween', 'sticks', 'close', 'enough', 'original', 'store', 'not', 'upset', 'horror', 'buffs', 'own', 'stamp', 'same', 'time', 'One', 'thing', 'film', 'delve', 'bit', 'deeper', 'childhood', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'movie', 'Halloween', 'where', 'meet', 'family', 'Michael', 'mother', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'stripper', 'abusive', 'drunken', 'crippled', 'boyfriend', 'baby', 'sister', 'older', 'sister', 'wearing', 'masks', 'constantly', 'fairly', 'normal', 'Well', 'two', 'seconds', 'watch', 'slaughter', 'pet', 'rat', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Michael', 'killed', 'schoolyard', 'bully', 'mother', 'work', 'boyfriend', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'Leaving', 'only', 'baby', 'alive', 'Sent', 'mental', 'asylum', 'Dr.', 'Samuel', 'Loomis', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'who', 'nice', 'see', 'nice-guy', 'role', 'assigned', 'treat', 'Michael', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Michael', 'killed', 'nurse', 'asylum', 'withdrawn', 'mind', 'not', 'long', 'mother', 'commits', 'suicide', '15', 'years', 'later', 'Michael', 'asylum', 'decides', 'try', 'find', 'sister', 'Most', 'things', 'happen', 'escape', 'will', 'seem', 'quite', 'familar', 'watchers', 'original', 'film', 'Zombie', 'did', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'Learning', 'Myers', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'creepy', 'casting', 'McDowell', 'whom', 'doubt', 'cast', 'love', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'casting', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'voice', 'Chucky', 'cop', 'aging', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'When', 'meet', 'Loomis', 'beginning', 'fairly', 'younger', 'guy', '15', 'years', 'later', 'Loomis', 'Well', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Halloween', 'share', 'originality', 'top', 'things', 'were', 'necessary', 'remake', 'i.e.', 'music', 'easily', 'best', 'remake', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'horror', 'film', 'good', 'long', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'very', 'gifted', 'writer/director', ""'m"", 'starting', 'like', 'movies', 'better', 'ever', 'liked', 'music', 'hope', 'movie', 'already', 'Zombie', 'created', 'signature', 'style', 'listen', 'dialogue', 'Michael', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'beginning', 'film', 'Anyway', 'horror', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'share', 'nudity', 'violence', 'overall', 'work', 'art.GRADE', 'A-']",Halloween

It stars Scout Taylour Compton as Laurie Strode Malcom McDowell as Dr. Loomis Sheri Moon Zombie is in this for the sake of being Rob's wife Daeg Fearch plays young Michael Myers Tyler Mane plays adult Michael Myers Danielle Harris make plays Annie Brad Douriff plays Lee Brackett. The story is young Michael Myers grows up in your cliche Rob Zombie white trash family who is abused by his step father & you get the F  in every sentence don't tell me I use language cause this is Rob Zombie writing this & he is a terrible writer he can't make good dialog. We learn Michael likes to kill animals I hear ""Oh it's realism"" those kinds of plots have been done over & over. They work for The Hannibal films not Halloween. So no it's not original it's cliche. Ok Michael is bullied at school Michael kills him in the woods he moves on to his sister & step father & becuse his sister won't take him trick or treating & you get love hurts a scene that I laughed at it is corny. I know it's Rob Zombie's Halloween but G*d D**n Michael isn't suppose to be a tragic character. He's doing it to protect his younger sister. By this point the mystery is gone we get pointless sessions between Michael Myers & Loomis then there's this scene that made me laugh Dr. Loomis & Michael's Mom leave the room & this Nurse looks at a picture & says ""Pretty baby couldn't be related to you."" she turns her back & you might as well as had a sign that said victim. Michael goes from average sized kid to almost 7 foot. Michael's escape is so retarted in the unrated version & this was suppose to be ""realistic."" Were introduced to Laurie Strode & her annoying friends Scout Taylor Compton has the acting ability of a porn star. After that we get a shorter poorer made version of the original. Michael is like Jason & not like The Shape  Tyler Mane has 2 maybe 3 ok scenes but he'd be a better Jason. Like I said stand alone movie it's maybe half way watchable but since Rob wanted the money he went & remade Halloween. Just becuse Michael is HUGH it's got a lot of blood I can watch Halloween II the good 1 & it's a lot better. If written right anybody can play Michael Myers but Rob Zombie can't write. & no this is not better than JC Halloween.

1102556,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000VKL6Z2,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[1, 3]","This Hollywood ""carnival"" of remakes is getting uglier with no end in sight. Almost none of them work and bring very little money--movie producers should have figured this out by now. But this nonsense did not stop rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie from creating a Heavy Metal version of the 1978 classic horror film Halloween. Zombie brings an upgrade by adding new materials of his own--he is also the producer and wrote the screenplay--but most of his new content does more bad than good. The film is a long, predictable, gory, unoriginal, loud and unnecessary remake. Yes, another distorted and destructive version of a classic. Like a said earlier, Hollywood is no stranger to these so-called remakes and I hope they stop.Brief Intro Story (some small spoilers):Introvert teenager Michael Myers lives with his dysfunctional family. He likes to wear his clown mask and loves torturing animals in his room while his stripper mother fights all the time with her alcoholic husband--Myer's older sister is not that nice either. After an incident with some bullies at school, Michael takes it to the next step. He becomes a ruthless serial killer and the bully is his first victim (this is where Zombie starts playing the classic main theme.)It's Halloween night and while his mother is ""working"" Michael decides to kill again and starts from home--using a big kitchen knife and a baseball bat. Everybody in the house gets it except his baby sister. His mother comes home and sees little Myers holding his baby sister and realizes what happened. After this horrific incident, he is taken into custody. While in prison, after talking to Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and his mom, little Michael kills again (this time a nurse is the victim) and that pretty much seals his fate--at least for now. Years pass by and Michael is now a super ""wrestler-like"" giant who still wear his masks, but he still lives in prison. Fortunately for him, that's about to change.Review:Director Rob Zombie takes the freedom to explore with more detail Myers' beginning--by using his Metal artistic style. In other words, we get to see the birth of the character and probably the reasons why he becomes the T-Rex of the serial killers--a broken home and an abusive father figure are the ingredients to his behavior. But Zombie makes a fatal mistake by degrading Myers to a new regular ""sick puppy"" status. In the original film, there was a mystery surrounding Myers because we didn't know for sure, if he was even human at all. But Zombie cannot help himself and gives too much unnecessary background detail to the slasher plus superhuman physical strength. Not only he looks like a WWE wrestler, he also can take many shots to the chest and a stab to the shoulder on top of that. Wait a minute, isn't he just a ""human"" serial killer in this remake? Zombie, you're taking away the mysticism of our bogeyman.Myers aside, the worst attributes of this Halloween are their goofy characters and their dialogue. It's all gibberish. There is no real focal point in any of them--sexual situations and dirty talk are abundant here. Not only nudity is overdone as well as the amount of blood on screen. In the original film, the killings were mostly subjective, but again Zombie follows the steps of the new ""mainstream"" of horror movies like Saw and brings an unnecessary bloodbath to the film--which by the way, the amount of blood that the victims bleed is very unrealistic.Perhaps I'm being too harsh on Rob Zombie's effort. Despite the negativity, there are some moments of suspense that actually work. For example; young Myers killing the bully is probably the best horror scene. Also the moment when young Myers wears his white mask for the first time creating the Halloween legend, which is pretty intense to watch--the mask gets an upgrade and looks rough and scary.The Verdict:Moviegoers know that we have to take these remakes with a grain of salt and you don't have to be a film critic to figure that out. We've been letdown before. Rob Zombie's remake doesn't even come close to the horror and mystery of the 1978 cult classic. Adding more gore, nudity and taking away good build-up, character development and coherent dialogue are not the way to please the old school fans. Yes, there are very few moments of horror, but not enough to pay for the general admission.",2,"The film is a long, predictable, gory, unoriginal, loud and unnecessary remake.",1198454400,"12 24, 2007",2007,4353,"['Hollywood', 'carnival', 'remakes', 'getting', 'uglier', 'end', 'sight', 'Almost', 'none', 'work', 'bring', 'very', 'little', 'money', 'movie', 'producers', 'should', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'now', 'nonsense', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'rocker-turned-director', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'creating', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'version', '1978', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'Halloween', 'Zombie', 'upgrade', 'adding', 'new', 'materials', 'own', 'also', 'producer', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'most', 'new', 'content', 'more', 'bad', 'good', 'film', 'long', 'predictable', 'gory', 'unoriginal', 'loud', 'unnecessary', 'remake', 'Yes', 'distorted', 'destructive', 'version', 'classic', 'said', 'earlier', 'Hollywood', 'stranger', 'so-called', 'remakes', 'hope', 'stop.Brief', 'Intro', 'Story', 'small', 'spoilers', 'Introvert', 'teenager', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'wear', 'clown', 'mask', 'torturing', 'animals', 'room', 'stripper', 'mother', 'fights', 'time', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'Myer', 'older', 'sister', 'not', 'nice', 'incident', 'bullies', 'school', 'Michael', 'next', 'step', 'ruthless', 'serial', 'killer', 'bully', 'first', 'victim', 'where', 'Zombie', 'playing', 'classic', 'main', 'theme', 'Halloween', 'night', 'mother', 'working', 'Michael', 'kill', 'again', 'home', 'using', 'big', 'kitchen', 'knife', 'baseball', 'bat', 'Everybody', 'house', 'baby', 'sister', 'mother', 'home', 'little', 'Myers', 'holding', 'baby', 'sister', 'realizes', 'what', 'happened', 'horrific', 'incident', 'taken', 'custody', 'prison', 'talking', 'Dr.', 'Samuel', 'Loomis', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'mom', 'little', 'Michael', 'kills', 'again', 'time', 'nurse', 'victim', 'pretty', 'much', 'seals', 'fate', 'least', 'now', 'Years', 'pass', 'Michael', 'now', 'super', 'wrestler-like', 'giant', 'who', 'still', 'wear', 'masks', 'still', 'prison', 'Fortunately', 'change.Review', 'Director', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'freedom', 'explore', 'more', 'detail', 'Myers', 'beginning', 'using', 'Metal', 'artistic', 'style', 'other', 'words', 'get', 'see', 'birth', 'character', 'probably', 'reasons', 'why', 'T-Rex', 'serial', 'killers', 'broken', 'home', 'abusive', 'father', 'figure', 'are', 'ingredients', 'behavior', 'Zombie', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'degrading', 'Myers', 'new', 'regular', 'sick', 'puppy', 'status', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'Myers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'was', 'even', 'human', 'Zombie', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'too', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'background', 'detail', 'slasher', 'superhuman', 'physical', 'strength', 'Not', 'only', 'WWE', 'wrestler', 'also', 'can', 'take', 'many', 'shots', 'chest', 'stab', 'shoulder', 'top', 'Wait', 'minute', ""n't"", 'just', 'human', 'serial', 'killer', 'remake', 'Zombie', ""'re"", 'taking', 'away', 'mysticism', 'bogeyman.Myers', 'aside', 'worst', 'attributes', 'Halloween', 'are', 'goofy', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'gibberish', 'real', 'focal', 'point', 'sexual', 'situations', 'dirty', 'talk', 'are', 'abundant', 'here', 'Not', 'only', 'nudity', 'overdone', 'as', 'well', 'amount', 'blood', 'screen', 'original', 'film', 'killings', 'were', 'mostly', 'subjective', 'again', 'Zombie', 'steps', 'new', 'mainstream', 'horror', 'movies', 'Saw', 'unnecessary', 'bloodbath', 'film', 'way', 'amount', 'blood', 'victims', 'bleed', 'very', 'unrealistic.Perhaps', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'harsh', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'effort', 'negativity', 'are', 'moments', 'suspense', 'actually', 'work', 'example', 'young', 'Myers', 'killing', 'bully', 'probably', 'best', 'horror', 'scene', 'Also', 'moment', 'when', 'young', 'Myers', 'white', 'mask', 'first', 'time', 'creating', 'Halloween', 'legend', 'pretty', 'intense', 'watch', 'mask', 'upgrade', 'rough', 'scary.The', 'Verdict', 'Moviegoers', 'know', 'have', 'take', 'remakes', 'grain', 'salt', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'film', 'critic', 'figure', 'out', ""'ve"", 'been', 'letdown', 'before', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'remake', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'horror', 'mystery', '1978', 'cult', 'classic', 'Adding', 'more', 'gore', 'nudity', 'taking', 'away', 'good', 'build-up', 'character', 'development', 'coherent', 'dialogue', 'are', 'not', 'way', 'please', 'old', 'school', 'fans', 'Yes', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'moments', 'horror', 'not', 'enough', 'pay', 'general', 'admission']",Halloween

1102559,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000VKL6Z2,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 3]","With the release of ""Halloween"" in 1978, director John Carpenter introduced audiences to one of cinema history's most classic villains, Michael Myers, and ushered in the era of the slasher film. Even though his film was not all that much of a slasher film, in fact it was more of a thriller, the many sequels, and countless other film series', which were spawned from it were much more in the vein of slashers. Skip forward to 2007, after 7 sequels, some good and some not so much, the `Halloween' film series seemed to have run its course, so it must have appeared to some in Hollywood that the only options left for this franchise were to, A) let it die (which would have been fine and should have happened after ""Halloween: H20""), B) continue making pointless sequel after sequel that would most likely wind up going straight to DVD shelves (case in point, the `Hellraiser' series), or C) remake/reimagine the franchise. Apparently option C seemed the most viable, as musician/director/writer Rob Zombie (""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"") was tapped to helm this new incarnation of Michael Myers with his remake of the original film, simply titled ""Halloween"".""Halloween"" is partly a remake of the John Carpenter original film from 1978, but is also an origin story for Michael Myers (this time played by Tyler Mane), giving viewers some insight into what caused Michael to become the monster that he is. Michael Myers seemed like a fairly normal 10-year-old kid, but appearances can often be deceiving. Behind his seemingly innocent faade was a cold-blooded killer, he just hadn't manifested himself fully yet. Then one Halloween night, Michael suddenly unleashes his dark side and kills his stepfather, older sister and her boyfriend, leaving only his mother and younger sister, Laurie alive. After the grisly murders, Michael is locked away in a psychiatric hospital where he meets his longtime doctor Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), and begins to fall even further into the abyss of his murderous psychosis. Fast forward 15 years, and Michael suddenly decides it is time to escape the hospital that has served as his prison for so long, and return to the town where his rampage began and to finish what he started by killing his only remaining family member, his younger sister that he had spared all those years ago.The choice of Rob Zombie as director/writer for the new film didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to me. Sure, the franchise had kind of wandered into the typical slasher subgenre of horror films, but Zombie's brand of horror was much more extreme and gratuitous than anything contained within this film series. However, when the film was released and began receiving some praise for the reinterpretation of the original classic, I thought maybe Rob Zombie had managed to make a more mainstream, and better film instead of his demented crop of horror films that he'd been crafting over the last couple of years. So, when I rented the film I approached it openly, and had hopes that it would be a good film, that could possibly equal the original (which should always be the goal for any remake), and if nothing else give an interesting origin story to the character of Michael. Upon watching the film, I soon realized, after getting about 30 minutes into the movie, that this film though not a typical Rob Zombie movie, it did contain most of the familiar elements that he loves to include in his films, i.e. plenty of language, graphic nudity, disturbing images, and extreme violence. Basically, Rob was making a more toned down film than usual, but in the end it didn't really feel like it was all that much of a `Halloween' film, as it seemed to still fit more in line with Zombie's previous two disturbing pieces of cinema, than with the series it was supposedly paying homage to while trying to breathe new life into the character.The story, as I stated earlier, is a mixture of origin tale and remake all rolled into one film. The first half of the film is devoted to the early years of Michael Myers, essentially expanding on the opening moments from the original movie. This portion of the movie was somewhat interesting because it was showcasing a different time in the life of this villain, and also giving some clues as to why he became this killer. But, this new origin seemed to contradict the opening of the original film, because here Michael's family is painted as broken and abusive, whereas in the original he appeared to have come from a loving home and he simply snapped one day. Having Michael come from such an abusive upbringing served as a way of explaining why he killed some members of his family, mainly the ones who mistreated him the most, but it also seemed like an attempt on Zombie's part to humanize Michael and to try to get the audience to feel some semblance of sympathy for the character. This is where I feel the movie made a big mistake; the film is about Michael Myers, one of the most dreaded villains in cinema, I for one do not want to be made to feel sorry for this character. Why should we as an audience be sympathetic to him, why not just show him as a kid who suddenly snapped, committed a horrible crime, and then show how he slipped further into psychosis while in the mental hospital. That is what I thought this movie was going to do, and to an extent it did, but it also seemed to go to great lengths to create sympathy, which should not have happened. Once Michael is committed to the institution the movie seems to gain momentum, and these are some of the most fascinating scenes in the movie, and I thought that Rob Zombie actually did a good job of showing the character's gradual descent into madness, and he also used this as an opportunity to explore why Michael always wears a mask, which was a surprising addition to the story.The second half of the film, is basically a rehash of the original film with some changes made to certain events, but it is pretty much the first movie condensed into one hour. This portion of the movie works on some levels, I liked some of the changes that Rob made to the original film, but it was also nice to see that even after all these years some aspects of the original movie are just too good to change, and should just be redone similar to how they were before. However, as good as parts of this section of the movie was, they were overshadowed by Rob Zombie's penchant for blood, gore, and gratuitous nudity, all of which took away from not just this portion of the film, but the entire movie as well since all of these components were sprinkled throughout.The actors in this film were all decent; those playing the various teenagers were average at best. Their performances for the most part were fairly by the book, and therefore their characters were pretty much forgettable, not a single one of them contained even an ounce of the screen presence of Jamie Lee Curtis. Her performance in the original film is part of what made that film so successful, she was so sweet and innocent, and Jamie played her so naturally that you couldn't help but invest in her as a character. But the ones here were pretty much standard horror film fare, no real standouts just a bunch of unknowns trying to make a break, but none of them deliver anything resembling a memorable performance. The highlight of the cast was Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis, the role made famous by the late Donald Pleasance. Malcolm plays Loomis as a caring child psychologist who desperately wants to reach Michael in hopes of finding some good in him, and when he realizes that this can't happen it breaks his heart. So when Michael escapes, Loomis comes after him with such zeal that it seems borderline obsessive. McDowell is fun to watch as Dr. Loomis, and steals every scene that he is in, and convincingly takes the doctor from being a man who cares for this young boy as merely a patient to being a man obsessed with stopping this monster who he feels responsible for because of his failure to reach him. It was a new angle to view the character from and one that Malcolm did an exceptional job handling.In the end, ""Halloween"" is a major letdown of a remake. It fails to even come close to capturing what made the original film so good, and I think a majority of the blame must be laid on the shoulders of the film's writer/director Rob Zombie. His talents as a screenwriter and director are average at best, definitely not worthy of big screen feature films, his films seem more at home in the Direct-to-DVD marketplace. Even if you are a fan of Rob Zombie's work in movies, I believe that even you fans have got to admit that his adaptation of ""Halloween"" is nowhere near good enough to hold a candle to John Carpenter's original classic that started it all.""Halloween"" is available in rated R and unrated editions, both containing graphic violence, language, nudity/sexuality, and gore.",2,"Evil Has A

Just about all the sequels blew one way or the other, changing Michael Myers from a lunatic into an unstoppable juggernaut. Bullets can't stop him! Fire can't stop him! Decapitation can't stop him! Who cares anymore?! This began a whole trainload of bat guano mascarading as horror/splatter flicks like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elmstreet, ad naseum, with monsters that can't be killed and teenagers who can, and are, no matter how clever they are. The fanboy geeks love it because their sophistication level isn't exactly stellar, let's face it.This is why Rob Zombie made House of 1,000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects - to bring the horror back into horror films. The creepiness level and humor that made the early genre so great is missing during later entrees - and even more so in the whole alleged ""re-invention"" with crapola like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Saw, Hostel....Zombie's Halloween is a slightly different film than Carpenters, almost as if you are seeing the same story from another perspective. And it's brilliant. The first half (the part many horror nerds gripe about because they can't stand characterization and just want to see gore and blood and some dumb creep in a halloween mask killing people as fast as he can - ""what's the body count, dude?"") is riveting and far more interesting than the 2nd half, which plays out like the original movie. But even that part is great. This movie has got to be one of the best ""slasher flicks"" of all time.

Kelly,"[3, 9]","You know you're watching a Rob Zombie film by the amount of facial hair, verbal abuse, domestic squalor and bar brawl ballads peppering the scenes. And ""Halloween"" doesn't disappoint in the opening act, with the stripper mom tossing breakfast plates at her deadbeat significant other, who in the space of less than a minute belittles an infant and lusts after the underage whore daughter. I call it Jerry Springer noir.But when, soon after, young Michael Myers is shuffling from room to room mechanically killing everyone in his home on Halloween night, the action lacks tension. At which time I realized that without suspense, murder scenes come off as clinical, no more heart-racing than a knee operation. That wouldn't be so bad if, in between the psycho surgery, there was a healthy dose of witty, nihilistic hillbilly banter. But you get lines like, ""I know I was born, but I wasn't born yesterday"" that belong in intentionally stupid films like ""Snakes on a Plane.""I was expecting Zombie to transport the Myers clan to the pork-fried South setting of his earlier films -- with haunted houses staffed by double-headed nuclear fallout survivors, day-glo basilisks and scuba-suited big-rig drivers high on meth and gasoline. The only actor who earns his paycheck actually is a trucker by the name of Big Joe Grizzley (Ken Foree), but he's rubbed out a few blinks after he's introduced -- although his outfit continues in his stead. The kid (Daeg Faerch) looks the part but his acting prep seemed to consist primarily of swigging 'Tussin a half-hour before someone yelled, ""Action."" Zombie broods over young Michael for such a significant amount of time that by the end, you're left wondering why he bothered at all when, just as in the original, Michael turns out to be no more than a mindless beast.In an interview with Premiere before the film's release, Zombie compared the legend of Michael Myers to the ""Frankenstein"" story, itself based on Prometheus, giving John Carpenter's franchise much more credit than it deserves. But he goes on to say, ""My movie takes place as if no other movies ever existed. It's not connected to anything,"" a baffling statement because when ""Halloween's"" perspective switches from Michael to other characters in the ""present-day"" portion of the film, scenes looks as if they were lifted straight from the Carpenter version.

Perhaps, with the right writer/director. And whom might be the man for the job? That would be Rob Zombie. Zombie's Halloween is gritty, realistic and character driven.Zombie did a number of things right besides leaving the music, characters and setting in place. He made his movie a back story/prequel leading into a quasi remake. He penetrated the mythos of Michael Meyers with realistic applications of psychopathology leading into the orgins of a budding serial killer. Zombie is obviously well versed in psychology and the buisness of serial killing. Michael Meyers becomes more human and real in Zombie's version but only to a point. Meyers still retains an ominous, etheral quality and Zombie leaves the audience wanting to know even more about him and his motives. Does that suggest a sequel? No, it suggests a powerful movie experience and a worthy finale to the Halloween franchise.As a side note:This theatrical version is better than the unrated version because the escape sequence is more realistic and the edits make the movie less sympathetic to Michael which makes for a more streamlined and scary experience.",5,"John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven and now.....Rob Zombie",1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,1234,"['wise', 'try', 'remake', 'greatest', 'horror', 'movie', 'time', 'No', 'not', 'Can', 'be', 'done', 'successfully', 'Perhaps', 'right', 'writer/director', 'whom', 'might', 'be', 'man', 'job', 'would', 'be', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'character', 'driven.Zombie', 'did', 'number', 'things', 'right', 'leaving', 'music', 'characters', 'setting', 'place', 'made', 'movie', 'back', 'story/prequel', 'leading', 'quasi', 'remake', 'penetrated', 'mythos', 'Michael', 'Meyers', 'realistic', 'applications', 'psychopathology', 'leading', 'orgins', 'budding', 'serial', 'killer', 'Zombie', 'obviously', 'well', 'versed', 'psychology', 'buisness', 'serial', 'killing', 'Michael', 'Meyers', 'more', 'human', 'real', 'Zombie', 'version', 'only', 'point', 'Meyers', 'still', 'ominous', 'etheral', 'quality', 'Zombie', 'audience', 'wanting', 'know', 'even', 'more', 'motives', 'suggest', 'sequel', 'No', 'powerful', 'movie', 'experience', 'worthy', 'finale', 'Halloween', 'side', 'note', 'theatrical', 'version', 'better', 'unrated', 'version', 'escape', 'sequence', 'more', 'realistic', 'edits', 'make', 'movie', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'Michael', 'more', 'streamlined', 'scary', 'experience']",Halloween

Rob Zombie has this annoying trademark of doing everything but literaly forcing you to sympathize with the 'bad guys'. Between the generic and predictable back stories to the sappy music he plays around his antagonists. I LOVE the original Halloween and Halloween 2. As a matter of fact every Halloween movie but 3 was better, and SCARIER, than this movie. I would have loved it if Rob had just made another entry, an original one, in the series rather than trying to turn an already great movie into the generic troubled kid next door scenario. Most of Micheal Myers' mystique was NOT KNOWING what the hell was going on behind that mask. Knowing made me like him less and it made me see him as much less threatening. Two things I doubt Mr. Zombie was goinmg for. ALSO a few things that bothered me about the 're make'Myers family seemed to be a middle class working family that didnt seem to stand out for any reason in the original. In the remake they are poor white trash. Even the houses fence and landscaping are much different.They actualy show Micheal in Halloween 2 I think, Maybe 1, for a flash and hes not a long haired blonde kid.How the hell, in Zombies version, did Micheal know Laurie was his sister? And whynot kill her when he was a child? She was 'innocent' I suppose...blech. Thats the problem with over explaining things. You cant explain some of the minute details and not others that actualy lend to the story.So he pops out, or pops in, Loomis' eyes yet in the very next scene there is no blood and he can see? WTF.Laurie Strode was not as big a pussy in the original and Zombie killing her parents in this version seemed very silly.Rob Zombie, for the love of god please stop using the same cast in every movie. It may work for comedys but this is getting annoying.Some of you will say this wasnt a remake at all but a retelling of the story in Rob Zombie world...I say whatever. I DO NOT recommend this movie at all for any reason. This is the first horror movie ever that has actualy BORED me and I have seen ALOT of horror movies.

I was glad that I got it but when I seen other peoples reviews and said there was a nice escape scene in the other version, I wished my dad got me the other one. Well this movie was very interesting. I liked how Zombie reflected about half of the movie on Myers childhood. I don't know if his family was really like that because it felt like he added his own sickest style to it. In the original the Myers family looked like middle or upper class people with a very nice house. When you look at this you see that the mom is a stripper and his step dad looks like a drunk with a very poor house. There was a lot of nudity in this movie to. There was some unnecessary scenes and that including one thing that made this movie go towards a sick and nasty Rob Zombie movie. There was a rape scene in this movie that felt really dumb and corny and I wished they would have just kept the escape scene. I haven't seen the escape scene but I can tell it was good by the reviews. I new the cast looked very familiar because they have been in every one of Robs movies. I thought the mask was very stylish and I think John should of done that. I wished it could have been a lot more violent because of the unrated version. It just looked like they wanted to focus on nudity and sex. Plus the ending felt very stale and I felt like I got dupped. The extras on the second disk was okay.

1102572,AYMVQD757T4ZS,B000VKL6Z2,"Kody ""ParisHiltonFan""","[5, 6]","What a travesty! Not so much that Halloween has been remade, but that Zombie's take on Michael Myers begins so well only to end up being a turd.I resisted seeing this upon release, but finally gave in when it available to me for free. The idea of one of my favorite films of all time being messed with just didn't sit right with me.I must admit that for the first 50 minutes I was genuinely captivated. Originally I was appalled by the prospect of fleshing out Michael Myer's childhood. What made it work was that this was clearly Zombie's vision. I could accept it because I didn't feel that this had anything to do with Carpenter's Michael Myers. It felt more like Zombie's fantasy of what Michael Myers childhood had been like in a white trash family and how it led to his murderous spree. Of course the scariest thing about the original Myers is that there is no apparent reason for his evil. He's a blank slate which all sorts of fears can be projected on. For Zombie that projection is having a stripper mom who has a boyfriend who threatens to ""skull f*&k;"" her. This all works because it is clearly Zombie's universe.The film goes down hill and I mean tumbling down when Zombie enters Carpenter's territory. The film becomes all to familiar in that its plot begins to mirror Carpenter's original. By no means is Zombie able to pay homage or even copy Carpenter in a compelling manner. What has to be the worst aspect of this is the actresses who play the three teenage girls. All of them are horrible, and what's most unforgivable is how awful the girl is who play Laurie Strode. This is the character who was played by Jamie Lee Curtis, who gave an iconic performance in the original. All this girl does is shriek and talk like some valley girl. Imagine this line, ""so like was that the boogie man"". Now I'm not sure if these were her exact words, but that's what her character is like. The biggest abomination of this fiasco is that it's not even scary. The set pieces just make you wish you were watching the original. Zombie only comes close only once to an effectively scary scene when Laurie is trapped in a drained pool. She can't get out and Myers is in hot pursuit. What kills this creative sequence is that you really could care less if the girl lives or dies. More will actually probably wish her to die. When you want the heroine to die in a horror film the director has failed.",3,"Halloween starts good, but then goes down hill....fast!",1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,2398,"['What', 'travesty', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'Halloween', 'been', 'remade', 'Zombie', 'take', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'so', 'well', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'turd.I', 'resisted', 'seeing', 'upon', 'release', 'finally', 'gave', 'when', 'available', 'free', 'idea', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'being', 'messed', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'right', 'me.I', 'must', 'admit', 'first', '50', 'minutes', 'was', 'genuinely', 'captivated', 'Originally', 'was', 'appalled', 'prospect', 'fleshing', 'out', 'Michael', 'Myer', 'childhood', 'What', 'made', 'work', 'was', 'was', 'clearly', 'Zombie', 'vision', 'could', 'accept', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'Carpenter', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'felt', 'more', 'Zombie', 'fantasy', 'what', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'childhood', 'had', 'been', 'white', 'trash', 'family', 'how', 'led', 'murderous', 'spree', 'course', 'scariest', 'thing', 'original', 'Myers', 'apparent', 'reason', 'evil', 'blank', 'slate', 'sorts', 'fears', 'can', 'be', 'projected', 'Zombie', 'projection', 'having', 'stripper', 'mom', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'skull', 'f*', 'k', 'clearly', 'Zombie', 'universe.The', 'film', 'down', 'hill', 'mean', 'tumbling', 'down', 'when', 'Zombie', 'Carpenter', 'territory', 'film', 'familiar', 'plot', 'mirror', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'means', 'Zombie', 'able', 'pay', 'homage', 'even', 'copy', 'Carpenter', 'compelling', 'manner', 'What', 'be', 'worst', 'aspect', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'three', 'teenage', 'girls', 'are', 'horrible', 'what', 'most', 'unforgivable', 'how', 'awful', 'girl', 'who', 'play', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'who', 'gave', 'iconic', 'performance', 'original', 'girl', 'shriek', 'talk', 'valley', 'girl', 'Imagine', 'line', 'so', 'like', 'was', 'boogie', 'man', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'were', 'exact', 'words', 'what', 'character', 'biggest', 'abomination', 'fiasco', 'not', 'even', 'scary', 'set', 'pieces', 'just', 'make', 'wish', 'were', 'watching', 'original', 'Zombie', 'only', 'close', 'only', 'once', 'effectively', 'scary', 'scene', 'when', 'Laurie', 'trapped', 'drained', 'pool', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'Myers', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'What', 'creative', 'sequence', 'really', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'girl', 'More', 'will', 'actually', 'probably', 'wish', 'die', 'When', 'want', 'heroine', 'die', 'horror', 'film', 'director', 'failed']",Halloween

1102576,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B000VKL6Z2,LadyLestat,"[3, 5]","First of all, I think Rob Zombie is just getting better and better at this. Afterall, I thought the best he had to offer was ""House of a 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" but this movie exceeded all expectations that I had. Secondly, I am pleasantly surprised to see that his wife Sherry Moon Zombie can actually act which I was highly doubtful of in the beginning. To be quite honest, I don't know if this movie can be considered a remake or a prequel, but maybe, it's Zombie's vision of Michael Myers, and this was his take on the story. Thus, giving the audience an understanding of why Michael Myers is the monster that he is. Personally, I think Rob Zombie's mission is to breathe life back into the horror genre that has been dead and buried for some time now thanks to the lack of originality by ""the powers that be."" I believe his mission has been accomplished with this version of Halloween. This movie is not some ""teen slasher"" fluke, nor is it for for the squeamish at all, and it's the closest thing you'll find to scary these days. It starts off showing Michael Myers as a 10 year old boy. Michael's mother is a stripper, his stepfather is abusive, and his older sister is a slut. Michael is also tormented at school by fellow classmates. In fact, the only things that Michael finds any solice in, is torturing and killing animals and his ability to create masks. The only person Michael even relates to is his baby sister. On Halloween, Michael snaps by beating one of his bullies to death in the woods behind the school. Later on that night, he kills his stepfather, sister, and her boyfriend after they refuse to take him trick or treating. After that, Michael is institutionalized for having no knowledge of even commiting these murders. I think we all know the rest of the story from here. At any rate, this movie goes inside the mind of one of the sickest, most brutal killers of all time. I hate to have to spoil some of the ending for those who haven't seen it yet, but the one reasons I don't think this is a prequel or a remake because Michael kills Dr. Loomis in this one, and we all know for this to be a prequel or a remake that can't be possible.

My favorite is Part II where Michael is trying to kill his sister at the hospital.  Throw in Jamie Lee Curtis, I'm sold!But I digress.I have to admit that while I've watched Rob Zombie's other movies, none of them have been remarkable for me.  However, this remake of Halloween has certainly gotten my attention.What I love about this remake is that there are background information added to the story.  For example, how Michael came to be this ""immortal"" serial killer.  Rob Zombie takes us back to Michael's childhood.  It seems that Michael has always been a bad seed, limiting his evil deeds with just mutilating animals.  The monster in him emerges when he reaches a breaking point with his classmates bullying him, his mother always working, the mother's boyfriend constantly picking on him, and his older sister neglecting him for her boyfriend.  Only his innocent baby sister escapes his rage.Years later, we see Michael breaking out of an asylum.  What's freaky is that Michael is this huge guy, about 6'8"".  Michael makes those WWF guys look like sissies.  So, can you imagine facing a serial killer with that kind of build?  That's enough to scare the nine lives outta you.  (I know, I know...we're not cats.)Anyways, if you've seen the original in regards to Michael's return to Haddonfield, you'll start to connect the missing pieces that Rob Zombie presents with what you can remember (from John Carpenter's film).

1102578,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000VKL6Z2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","The unrated director's cut of Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" coming out in time for Christmas?  Well, the movie only came out on August 31st of this year, which I thought was two months early for this particular film, but apparently that was so they could still get the DVD out in time for it to be an ironic if not perverse stocking stuffer (the movie was still in theaters at the start of December).  Marketing strategy aside, it should be made clear that this film is actually more than a remake of John Carpenter'soriginal.  The story of how young Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) became a killer as a little kid is now the entire first act of the film and not simply the prologue, and in Zombie's revisions it is made clear why Michael picked up that big knife and started slicing and dicing.  Bullied at school, abused at home by his wicked stepfather (William Forsythe), and saddled with a stripper for a mom (Sheri Moon Zombie), Michael has more than his fair share of issues.We also get to see some of Michael's sessions with Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and what happened to make Michael's baby sister an orphan.  This reflects the other significant difference between this and the original, which is that this time around we know that Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is Michael's sister.  Actually, in the final analysis this movie covers what happens in the original and what happens in thesequel(and if you want to stretch things Michael's fascinating with masks could be a wink and a nod to the atrocious ""Halloween III - Season Of The Witch"").  Not that Laurie ever makes it to the hospital, but in the end it come to the siblings.  That sounds like a lot, to condense two movies and add a whole new first act, but once Zombie gets to Halloween present he concentrates on hitting the highlights from the original and throwing in plenty of echoes from the originals: ""The Thing from Another World"" is still playing on the television and ""Mr. Sandman"" is still being sung.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at Zombie's strategy in making this film.  On the one hand he sticks to the unforgettable music of Carpenter's original score, but on the other he avoids going head to head with that movie's iconic scene when Laurie finds the tableau display of Annie's corpse.  I also have to say there was a lot less blood and gore than I would have suspected given Zombie's previous cinematic efforts (e.g., ""The Devil's Rejects""), but there is a concerted effort here to be more in the style of the original and it is nice to be reminded that a good door slam can be more terrorizing that a geyser of blood.  It is for that slight change in sensibilities, plus all the nifty DVD extras, that lead me to round up on this one.  It goes without saying that the remake does not surpass the original--which stands out in our memories because for most of us it was the first time we saw the killer keep getting up again and again--but no one ever thinks that is going to be the case, so when that turns out to be the case it is not a surprise.  Just do not be surprised when you finish watch this remake that you do not feel the urge to go back and enjoy the original yet again.",4,"More than just a remake of the original, for what that is worth",1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,3192,"['unrated', 'director', 'cut', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'remake', 'Halloween', 'coming', 'out', 'time', 'Christmas', 'Well', 'movie', 'only', 'came', 'out', 'August', '31st', 'year', 'thought', 'was', 'two', 'months', 'early', 'particular', 'film', 'apparently', 'was', 'so', 'could', 'still', 'get', 'DVD', 'out', 'time', 'be', 'ironic', 'not', 'perverse', 'stocking', 'stuffer', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'theaters', 'start', 'December', 'Marketing', 'strategy', 'aside', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'clear', 'film', 'actually', 'more', 'remake', 'John', ""Carpenter'soriginal"", 'story', 'how', 'young', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Daeg', 'Faerch', 'became', 'killer', 'little', 'kid', 'now', 'entire', 'first', 'act', 'film', 'not', 'simply', 'prologue', 'Zombie', 'revisions', 'made', 'clear', 'why', 'Michael', 'picked', 'up', 'big', 'knife', 'started', 'slicing', 'dicing', 'Bullied', 'school', 'abused', 'home', 'wicked', 'stepfather', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'saddled', 'stripper', 'mom', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'Michael', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'issues.We', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'Michael', 'sessions', 'Dr.', 'Samuel', 'Loomis', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'what', 'happened', 'make', 'Michael', 'baby', 'sister', 'orphan', 'other', 'significant', 'difference', 'original', 'time', 'know', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'Michael', 'sister', 'Actually', 'final', 'analysis', 'movie', 'what', 'original', 'what', 'thesequel', 'want', 'stretch', 'things', 'Michael', 'fascinating', 'masks', 'could', 'be', 'wink', 'nod', 'atrocious', 'Halloween', 'III', 'Season', 'Witch', 'Not', 'Laurie', 'ever', 'hospital', 'end', 'siblings', 'lot', 'condense', 'two', 'movies', 'add', 'whole', 'new', 'first', 'act', 'once', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'present', 'hitting', 'highlights', 'original', 'throwing', 'plenty', 'echoes', 'originals', 'Thing', 'World', 'still', 'playing', 'television', 'Mr.', 'Sandman', 'still', 'being', 'sung.Overall', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Zombie', 'strategy', 'making', 'film', 'one', 'hand', 'unforgettable', 'music', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'score', 'other', 'going', 'head', 'head', 'movie', 'iconic', 'scene', 'when', 'Laurie', 'tableau', 'display', 'Annie', 'corpse', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'lot', 'less', 'blood', 'gore', 'would', 'have', 'suspected', 'given', 'Zombie', 'previous', 'cinematic', 'efforts', 'e.g.', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'concerted', 'effort', 'here', 'be', 'more', 'style', 'original', 'nice', 'be', 'reminded', 'good', 'door', 'slam', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'terrorizing', 'geyser', 'blood', 'slight', 'change', 'sensibilities', 'nifty', 'DVD', 'extras', 'lead', 'round', 'up', 'one', 'saying', 'remake', 'not', 'surpass', 'original', 'out', 'memories', 'most', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'killer', 'keep', 'getting', 'up', 'again', 'again', 'one', 'ever', 'going', 'be', 'case', 'so', 'when', 'out', 'be', 'case', 'not', 'surprise', 'Just', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'finish', 'watch', 'remake', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'urge', 'go', 'back', 'enjoy', 'original', 'yet', 'again']",Halloween
1102579,A3TDW3TDZKUVJ,B000VKL6Z2,Leah-S,"[3, 5]","*WARNING: This Review Contains Spoilers*As every horror movie fan is aware, John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is a classic, this is Rob's vision & not a total remake, so it's quite different than the original, hence the ""reimagining"" part.The Movie: Overall, it's similar to the original & yet it's very different. Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" is significantly darker, gory & has way more profanity, no big surprise there if you've seen Zombie's other films. There is more of a back story with Michael Myers, I understand some fans liked that whereas other fans of the original didn't, many preferred the mystery with Michael Myers. I personally preferred the actors performances in the 1978 version, but again, that's just my opinion. I found that in some scenes the girls were rather irritating to watch when they interacted with one-another & were over-acting at times to ensure that the audience knew they were close. Scout Taylor-Compton did a decent job, I'd never seen her in anything prior to this, I know that when the film was announced she got some flack for portraying Laurie Strode, mainly because she was famously played originally by Scream-Queen, Jamie Lee Curtis & it was a tough role to beat. One of the biggest differences I noticed in this from the original is that it's no secret, to the audience, that Laurie Strode (aka, Boo) is Michael myers' little sister; John Carpenter didn't release that information to fans until ""Halloween 2"".The BluRay: Works well, no issues with playing it. If I'm not mistaken, there are quite a few special features, I haven't watched it in a while, but from what I remember they were pretty decent.Overall: I recommend giving it a watch.

I thought that it was a very solid effort by Rob Zombie considering some of his other movies I had not been to found of. I got to see the first Halloween first before the new one so that was cool. The one thing that I really liked about the new movie is it took time to give you the story we he wants to live behind the mask. You got to see what it was like in his family and how kids treated him and there were some pretty cool killings. Another thing that I liked about the new Halloween is this was non stop action. I have watched all the Halloweens and they seemed to move slower which is not a bad thing but I would say it was a nice change to see non stop action. I did not know when it was going to end but the ending is for you to judge I did not like it that much and I will say that is the only flaw in this movie but a really solid effort and better than the recent Halloween movies.

1102584,A3QZU3A1L17O3M,B000VKL6Z2,Lulu Magoo,"[21, 36]","01/05/2010 I just finished watching the original theatrical version of Rob Zombie's Halloween after 3 years have passed from my seeing the unrated version and I just HAVE to update my original 1 star review of the unrated version with my thoughts on the theatrical version which I am now giving 5 stars.Perhaps it took a little time for me to fully appreciate this movie... or maybe my initial reaction was overly critical because John Carpenter's original version was undeniably one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The theatrical version was much, much better than the unrated cut. It was scarier and less drawn out. Missing were the artsy elements that I found useless and distracting in the unrated cut. The pacing in this version was just so much better. The theatrical version of this movie was in my opinion, as scary as the original and I really liked that Ron Zombie nailed two key elements that make for a really good horror flick:1. Having the creepy bad guy lurking in the shadows - often.2. The silent chase at the end of the movie - just as terrifying here as in Rob's House of 1000 Corpses.My only complaints still stand from my original review of the unrated version, and that was I think it was rather unnecessary to have included all of the character actors - it was somewhat of a distraction but 3 years later, it didn't bother me as much as the first time around. Secondly, the scenes toward the end at Michael's house were too dark to see well on TV.Below is my original review of the unrated version from when the movie first came out in 2007:***Spoiler Alert***But then again, how can I spoil a remake?I just got done watching the unrated Director's cut of Rob Zombie's Halloween and I think it was awful - just horribly and completely awful.The movie starts with Mike Myers as a little boy with a penchant for mutilating and killing animals.  He quickly moves on to brutally assault a school mate, to slice the throat of his mother's boyfriend, to bludgeon his sister's boyfriend with an aluminum baseball bat, then stab his sister to death.  I think this all happened in the first 20 minutes of the movie and I thought it was good up until the point when Michael was sent to the mental institution.  Then we sit for about 45 minutes watching Malcolm McDowell try and get through to Michael, who continues to mentally deteriorate and who sits around making and wearing masks all day.  Zombie attempts to be creative with the camera by including black & white aged film sequences of Michael wearing masks and staring at the camera. {{{Yawn}}}Jump ahead 15 years and Michael is still in the hospital, has grown to be about 6'8"" and eventually escapes (after murdering everyone in his way) and heads back to Haddonfield to find his little sister.This becomes the WORST part of the movie as almost every scene is shot in near darkness. (And those that aren't are practically identical to the ones from the original)  I became so frustrated at not knowing what house they were in, what room they were in....  More people die, Michael gets stabbed, shot, predictably bursts through the car window..... And is dead - or is he?Who cares. You know what made the original Halloween one of the best horror flicks of all time? It was scary.  Zombie's version is never scary. Never. Not one scene.I was actually a big fan of House of 1000 Corpses, with what I thought to be a pretty intensely scary ending. I was not a fan of the exploitation film ""The Devil's Rejects"" and I WAS looking forward to seeing Halloween but ugh. Why, oh why did Zombie feel to make this self-indulgent hack job of a flick?

To me it seems you should stick with what you are good at if you were blessed with a talent of some sorts you should by all means try to hold on to that talent and make it grow. Rob Zombie is a great musician he should have known better than to dabble in other arts there was one instance where he was lucky however and that was the devils rejects for a fan of a good gory shoot em up movie that was good but, that was all just good. There was no need to remake this movie there was nothing wrong with the original. There was no reason to explain the killer and why he did what he did throughout the entire franchise it was already explained that he was pure evil. The original showed that Michael Myers grew up in a loving family that's what helped make the story good because nobody understood how a good family raised a killer child plain and simple. This movie ruined the credibility that the story once had. As a writer and a reviewer I must look at all sides of the movie and judge it fairly there were some parts I liked about it, the story actually made sense it seemed logical for Michael Myers to turn out a killer after his childhood was stolen from him, but there is a problem with that considering there has been a franchise of Halloween for a long time the classics never die until remakes like this come out it's about as bad as casting a rapper to be an actor (Halloween resurrection) I guess it's almost fair to say the franchise died when Busta Rhymes appeared in that movie the only good part was when he was stabbed, I am trailing off here so I guess I said what needed to be said about this movie, Rob stick with the music don't kill your career just yet.",2,Rob Robbed The Classic,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,1918,"['have', 'been', 'wanting', 'slam', 'movie', 'time', 'now', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'time', 'here', 'respect', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'musician', 'love', 'work', 'when', 'was', 'White', 'Zombie', 'day', 'one', 'favorite', 'bands', 'should', 'stick', 'what', 'are', 'good', 'were', 'blessed', 'talent', 'sorts', 'should', 'means', 'try', 'hold', 'talent', 'make', 'grow', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'great', 'musician', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'dabble', 'other', 'arts', 'was', 'one', 'instance', 'where', 'was', 'lucky', 'however', 'was', 'devils', 'rejects', 'fan', 'good', 'gory', 'shoot', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'was', 'need', 'remake', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'original', 'was', 'reason', 'explain', 'killer', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'entire', 'franchise', 'was', 'already', 'explained', 'was', 'pure', 'evil', 'original', 'showed', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'grew', 'up', 'loving', 'family', 'what', 'helped', 'make', 'story', 'good', 'nobody', 'understood', 'how', 'good', 'family', 'raised', 'killer', 'child', 'plain', 'simple', 'movie', 'ruined', 'credibility', 'story', 'once', 'had', 'writer', 'reviewer', 'must', 'look', 'sides', 'movie', 'judge', 'fairly', 'were', 'parts', 'liked', 'story', 'actually', 'made', 'sense', 'seemed', 'logical', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'turn', 'out', 'killer', 'childhood', 'was', 'stolen', 'problem', 'considering', 'there', 'been', 'franchise', 'Halloween', 'long', 'time', 'classics', 'never', 'die', 'remakes', 'come', 'as', 'bad', 'casting', 'rapper', 'be', 'actor', 'Halloween', 'resurrection', 'guess', 'almost', 'fair', 'say', 'franchise', 'died', 'when', 'Busta', 'Rhymes', 'appeared', 'movie', 'only', 'good', 'part', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'stabbed', 'am', 'trailing', 'off', 'here', 'so', 'guess', 'said', 'what', 'needed', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'Rob', 'stick', 'music', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'career', 'just', 'yet']",Halloween
1102588,A3DT5X9I5IAEBL,B000VKL6Z2,man_invisible,"[26, 35]","If you check history, you will find that John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" did not come out the gate a critics' darling or a financial success; according to late producer/cowriter Debra Hill, the initial reactions ""were brutal."" Ironic, then, how it has since developed a revered following (though I'm honestly not a big fan) that most people today think was always the case.I bring this up because Rob Zombie's remake--in addition to being the shot in the arm the franchise desperately needs--will likely have the same fate; years down the road, I think it will be valued on the same level as the ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Hills Have Eyes"" remakes. While Zombie's film is jagged in spots, with narrative jumps (where did Loomis get the cop car? how does Michael get to Haddonfield from the middle-of-nowhere truck stop?) and plain-view continuity errors (some of which were probably inspired by the ill-advised Weinstein Bros. reshoots), the filmmaker has brought a pathos to this human monster that is more rich and fulfilling than any of the films prior (yes, I'm including the original).What seems to offend ""Halloween"" purists most is the mere principle of Zombie's undertaking--how DARE he remake a CLASSIC--instead of looking at the film in the broader scope of things: would you rather see Michael Myers going head-to-head with Busta Rhymes? How about a continuation of that desperate Celtic mumbo-jumbo? Zombie's position was inarguably unglamorous, no doubt realizing as many people would embrace his film as decry it. For my tastes, he has brought an angle that fuses popular serial killer lore with the sense of tragedy that marked the classic Universal Monsters--it's a tricky feat, but by introducing us to pint-size Michael (Daeg Faerch) and spending time with him, his adult counterpart--while a ruthless machine of brutality--possesses the faint traces of humanity that marked Frankenstein's Monster, or the Wolf Man. In many ways, his ultimate downfall is as tragic as the atrocities he commits. And THAT is what ultimately transcends all in ""Halloween""--putting a face and motive to what was once a mere in-the-shadows specter of ""evil.""The first half of the film provides a satisfying, creatively-filmed backstory (I'm anxiously awaiting the additional scenes being restored for the upcoming DVD), wherein we get an overview of young Michael, his fatal deeds, and his time in Smith's Grove, under the watch of Dr. Sam Loomis (a well-cast Malcolm McDowell). Only in the second half does ""Halloween"" kick into full-blown remake mode, with gritty renderings of scenes from Carpenter's film; despite this, Zombie manages to put his own spin on traditional scares, adding a visceral edge and urgency to death. I actually appreciated the truncated characterizations of Laurie (the immensely likable Scout Taylor-Compton), Lynda (Kristina Klebe), and Annie (""Halloween 4/5"" vet Danielle Harris), since their interactions in the original are what ultimately dulled it down for me; here, Zombie gives us a quick introduction (just enough time to get a feel for the characters) before getting down to business. And while the ""sex=death"" equation here is hardly inspired, it certainly beats the torture-device-laden-labyrinth of another ""Saw"" film.Zombie treats the material with a great deal of reverence and respect, and utilizes a reality-focused style to establish a proper tone (imagine the dustbowl squalor of ""The Devil's Rejects"" brought to suburbia); the death scenes are filmed with unflinching brutality, yet seldom feel exaggerated. Time will tell, but to me, ""Halloween"" is a more than worthy addition to the pantheon of great remakes (and horror films in general).",4,"In defense of ""Halloween""",1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,3680,"['check', 'history', 'will', 'find', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Halloween', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'gate', 'critics', 'darling', 'financial', 'success', 'according', 'late', 'producer/cowriter', 'Debra', 'Hill', 'initial', 'reactions', 'were', 'brutal', 'Ironic', 'then', 'how', 'developed', 'revered', 'following', ""'m"", 'honestly', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'most', 'people', 'today', 'think', 'was', 'always', 'case.I', 'bring', 'up', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'remake', 'addition', 'being', 'shot', 'arm', 'franchise', 'desperately', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'same', 'fate', 'years', 'road', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'valued', 'same', 'level', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'remakes', 'Zombie', 'film', 'jagged', 'spots', 'narrative', 'jumps', 'where', 'did', 'Loomis', 'get', 'cop', 'car', 'how', 'Michael', 'get', 'Haddonfield', 'middle-of-nowhere', 'truck', 'stop', 'plain-view', 'continuity', 'errors', 'were', 'probably', 'inspired', 'ill-advised', 'Weinstein', 'Bros.', 'reshoots', 'filmmaker', 'brought', 'pathos', 'human', 'monster', 'more', 'rich', 'fulfilling', 'films', 'prior', 'yes', ""'m"", 'including', 'original', 'offend', 'Halloween', 'most', 'mere', 'principle', 'Zombie', 'undertaking', 'how', 'DARE', 'remake', 'CLASSIC', 'instead', 'looking', 'film', 'broader', 'scope', 'things', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'going', 'head-to-head', 'Busta', 'Rhymes', 'How', 'continuation', 'desperate', 'Celtic', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'Zombie', 'position', 'was', 'inarguably', 'unglamorous', 'doubt', 'realizing', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'embrace', 'film', 'decry', 'tastes', 'brought', 'angle', 'popular', 'serial', 'killer', 'lore', 'sense', 'tragedy', 'marked', 'classic', 'Universal', 'Monsters', 'tricky', 'feat', 'introducing', 'pint-size', 'Michael', 'Daeg', 'Faerch', 'spending', 'time', 'adult', 'counterpart', 'ruthless', 'machine', 'brutality', 'faint', 'traces', 'humanity', 'marked', 'Frankenstein', 'Monster', 'Wolf', 'Man', 'many', 'ways', 'ultimate', 'downfall', 'as', 'tragic', 'atrocities', 'what', 'ultimately', 'Halloween', 'putting', 'face', 'motive', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'mere', 'in-the-shadows', 'specter', 'evil', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'satisfying', 'creatively-filmed', 'backstory', ""'m"", 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'additional', 'scenes', 'being', 'restored', 'upcoming', 'DVD', 'wherein', 'get', 'overview', 'young', 'Michael', 'fatal', 'deeds', 'time', 'Smith', 'Grove', 'watch', 'Dr.', 'Sam', 'Loomis', 'well-cast', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Only', 'second', 'half', 'Halloween', 'kick', 'full-blown', 'remake', 'mode', 'gritty', 'renderings', 'scenes', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'Zombie', 'put', 'own', 'spin', 'traditional', 'scares', 'adding', 'visceral', 'edge', 'urgency', 'death', 'actually', 'appreciated', 'truncated', 'characterizations', 'Laurie', 'immensely', 'likable', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'Lynda', 'Kristina', 'Klebe', 'Annie', '4/5', 'vet', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'interactions', 'original', 'are', 'what', 'ultimately', 'dulled', 'down', 'here', 'Zombie', 'quick', 'introduction', 'just', 'enough', 'time', 'get', 'feel', 'characters', 'getting', 'down', 'business', 'sex=death', 'equation', 'here', 'hardly', 'inspired', 'certainly', 'torture-device-laden-labyrinth', 'Saw', 'film.Zombie', 'material', 'great', 'deal', 'reverence', 'respect', 'reality-focused', 'style', 'establish', 'proper', 'tone', 'imagine', 'dustbowl', 'squalor', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'brought', 'suburbia', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'unflinching', 'brutality', 'yet', 'seldom', 'feel', 'exaggerated', 'Time', 'will', 'tell', 'Halloween', 'more', 'worthy', 'addition', 'pantheon', 'great', 'remakes', 'horror', 'films', 'general']",Halloween

1102591,A18XTPXBGQ26UD,B000VKL6Z2,"Marcus Damanda ""author of The Forever Show""","[6, 9]","There may be nothing in the world Rob Zombie could have done with this remake of the slasher masterpiece, HALLOWEEN, to outdo John Carpenter's original. The first, and best, HALLOWEEN took its audience by total surprise, and its subtletey continues to impress, especially now, in this age of excess, instant gratification, and horror gore. Having said that, the new HALLOWEEN is, by far, more frightening than any of the HALLOWEEN SEQUELS--and, yes, I am including Part II in that assessment.You can count me in on the large crowd that clamored and complained that HALLOWEEN didn't need remaking. I still think that. Rob Zombie was evidently conscious of this sentiment, too, because he went very far to make this movie his own. There are significant departures from the original storyline, which was powered by its very mystery and its unapologetically unexplainable boogeyman. By contrast, Zombie explains everything--and he makes you watch everything, too; not in the comfortable, established, Hollywood-safe method of bloodletting (watch any of the FRIDAY movies for examples of this), but in brutal, painful-to-watch murder scenes that are, at times, deliciously tortuous to endure.Some will say they don't want to know WHY Michael is what he is. He's more frightening because we DON'T get him. Okay. That's true. However, these explanations take up a lot of Zombie's movie, and whatever one may say about the strengths of the original, these are probably the most horrifying scenes in the film. Watching ten-year-old Michael take out everyone in his family other than his mother and little sister--using duct tape, a baseball bat, and, of course, a butcher knife--was the most disturbing thing I'd seen since HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER.What I missed most from the original was Donald Pleasance. I thought the replacement for Jamie Lee Curtis was actually the only real improvement the movie had on the original (and I just know that most people will disagree with me on that, but what the heck); but Malcolm McDowell is astonishingly weak in his portrayal of Dr. Loomis. Strange ... Going in, he was the only one I really had confidence in.It's impossible not to compare.

I thought it was brilliantly done.  Going back and showing Michael Myers' progression into becoming a serial killer was not only a very smart movie, but it was pulled off extremely well.  Of course, a lot of the movie was predictable, especially after Michael became an adult, but that's what you expect from Halloween movies.Nearly half of the movie is Michael as a child; finally reaching his breaking point after being bullied at school, and killing his first victim, then his entire family (except his sister, who we all know was Jamie Lee Curtis in all of the other Halloween movies).  I can't believe that I'm reading negative reviews about this portion of the movie.  It was brilliant in every regard.Michael wasn't ""less scary"" because they showed a human side of him.  It probably made him MORE scary, because he was an absolute nut job.  He just flat out stopped talking one day, and never spoke another word ever again.  He was deranged, yet extremely intelligent, calculated, and precise.  A world class serial killer.  Showing his background added to the series, and made me appreciate the other Halloween movies even more, now that you got a look at a background story.GREAT movie, and I highly recommend it.  4.5 stars.",4,Negative reviews?,1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,1348,"['1', 'Helpful', 'Review', 'site', 'ridiculously', 'movie', '1', 'star', 'How', 'EARTH', '1-star', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'Going', 'back', 'showing', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'progression', 'becoming', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'smart', 'movie', 'was', 'pulled', 'off', 'extremely', 'well', 'course', 'lot', 'movie', 'was', 'predictable', 'especially', 'Michael', 'became', 'adult', 'what', 'expect', 'Halloween', 'movies.Nearly', 'half', 'movie', 'Michael', 'child', 'finally', 'reaching', 'breaking', 'point', 'being', 'bullied', 'school', 'killing', 'first', 'victim', 'then', 'entire', 'family', 'sister', 'who', 'know', 'was', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'other', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'reading', 'negative', 'reviews', 'portion', 'movie', 'was', 'brilliant', 'regard.Michael', 'was', ""n't"", 'less', 'scary', 'showed', 'human', 'side', 'probably', 'made', 'MORE', 'scary', 'was', 'absolute', 'nut', 'job', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'stopped', 'talking', 'one', 'day', 'never', 'spoke', 'word', 'ever', 'again', 'was', 'deranged', 'yet', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'calculated', 'precise', 'world', 'class', 'serial', 'killer', 'Showing', 'background', 'added', 'series', 'made', 'appreciate', 'other', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'even', 'more', 'now', 'got', 'look', 'background', 'story.GREAT', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', '4.5', 'stars']",Halloween

While combining the inherant creepiness that is Michael Myers with a pretty plausible backstory that at points borders on touching or at least an insight into the monster, this film hits all the right now. While it allows itself to fall prey to the formula that other horror movies fall into; teens have sex, breasts get shown, teen dies-these are necessary evils for Rob Zombie when releasing a horror film especially one as iconic as Halloween who knows he must pay homage to thsoe that came before. Not only does he do this, but he does it with style, giving depth to characters that on the whole, no one has significant screen time. One of the large failures I see in horror films, is their inability to humanize the victims of the monsters that destroy them. Not so in this movie, instead the viewer gets to look into the eyes of the victims along with Michael Myers and the sheer terror reflected there reveals a film that must have been toughly directed because Rob Zombie somehow has his actors and actresses show real terror.

1102597,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B000VKL6Z2,Mark Turner,"[12, 16]","Rob Zombie has made a career of all things horror. From the musical group White Zombie to his own solo career, in comics with his monster fighting character El Superbeasto and into films. His first two forays, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES and THE DEVIL'S REJECTS tied into one another nicely with the second film being a sequel to the first. But with his third film, HALLOWEEN, Zombie falls short of offering not only scares but signs of a developmental director.Everyone already knows the tale of Michael Myers, the psychopath from Haddonfield, IL, who murdered his sister only to be committed to an institution he would later escape from with the intent of more killings back home years later. While that is the basis for Zombie's film, it is not a remake but more of a retelling, a reinvention of the same character.Here we are offered young Michael and the household he grows up in that forms his life. Michael's mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper, saddled with a new husband (William Forsythe) who is disabled and a neer do well more interested in yelling at the kids than in offering any sort of role model. Michael's sister is a trashy sleep with anyone teen who dresses provocatively and does little else. All of this is not lost on Michael who spends his time killing his pets and taking photos of them. What we are being offered is a textbook glimpse as to why a youngster becomes a serial killer. The nice middle class family shown in the original is tossed aside for this new group. And in this first portion of the film, the problems Zombie has are apparent.Zombie has filled three films now with the same characters. Sure, they may have different names and different small time characteristics, but the fact remains that he focuses on the dysfunctional family and their housecleaning inabilities. Yes, it seems that all families in Zombie's world can't clean to save themselves. Not only that but they all have the same dingy look to their living quarters as well as references to pop culture. The house Michael grows up in could be a home that the Firefly family would feel comfortable in. It all looks the same and that detracts greatly from the viewing experience, unless of course you'd never seen another Rob Zombie film.Comparisons to the original film are inevitable and this will most likely be the downfall of the film in the long run. Michael goes overboard with his murderous rampage as a child in this film unlike the original. Where no blood was seen in that film, it flows freely now. Perhaps this is due to the changing times, but it adds nothing to the scares of the film or the character. It does make him a more brutal killer, leaving him one without a touch of sympathy. But the mindless killer from the original is replaced by someone we feel absolutely nothing for now.Once finished with the whole back story of young Michael, his family and the kindly Dr. Loomis (Michael McDowell) who takes care of him at the institution, we move forward 15 years to when Michael escapes and heads back home. The body count increases once more as he kills everyone he comes into contact with their, including a worker who had befriended him. Once out, the story becomes more familiar, almost a duplicate of the original shot from different angles, with different actors and focusing less on the character of Laurie Strode, the central character in John Carpenter's version.Laurie and her friends are nothing more than meat to be slaughtered by Michael in this one. There is no development of character, no reason for us to think of them as more than teens in peril that we have seen in hundreds of other slasher flicks. While we cared about the original teens, this time around they seem less human and placed in our way for two reasons: to be killed by Michael and to offer more exposed flesh than the first.By the film's end we are offered the traditional sliced and diced teens, gratuitous nudity and enough blood to make a special effects company weep for joy at the size of their bill. But we have gained nothing in the iconography that is Michael Myers. While we are given more background on him, we care less about him than we ever did.Worst of all is the fact that Rob Zombie, a director that showed such great potential before, seems to be telling us after only three films that this is all he has to offer. Stories told from the same world, a world that blasts apart the whole FATHER KNOWS BEST world we would all like it to be. In his world, there is no caring parent. And when they are caring, they are twisted in some revolting way.I haven't given up on Zombie yet though. Having recently signed a two picture deal with the Weinstein's, perhaps he will show us he has more tricks up his sleeve than he let on. But if he returns to the carnie soiled world he's offered in three films to date, then it looks as though he's a one note director. Let's hope he offers us more.

You see, Michael Meyers, like most autistics, finds himself lost in a world he never made.  A world populated by frighteningly vulgar and loud neurotypicals who encroach relentlessly, victimizing him until he lashes out with great and fiery vengeance, laying waste to the sordid humanoids around him in a blistering blaze of white heat.  The sister's boyfriend who got put down with an alunimum bat was particularly deserving of this fate, by the way.  Just before getting his head beaten in, you see him fashioning a sandwich from noisesome cold cuts.  He's the type of person who has absolutely no personality whatsoever, apart from a basic sloppiness of demeanor and a shaggy mane of hair that is in the process of fusing into white dreads.  Such a pity his early demise.  The world has lost so very much.Michael then is unjustly incarcerated just for being a freedom fighter.  His mother can't take how great he is, and so she blows her brainz out.  Whatta shame.  So then Michael lays waste to some worthless hillbillies and busts right out of the mental hooskow, leading the resident psychiatrist and stereotypical liberal to bleat ""ooohh... oooh!""Flash forward to later that night.  More people need Michael to give them a proper seeing to, which he does, very autistically.  You see, the man behind the mask is the perfect metaphor for autism.  The sense of disconnect and alienation, the sense of needing shelter... add in the fact that the original Meyers mask was adapted from a rubber mask of Captain Kirk (William Shatner interpretation) and we've come full circle.

However, this is really quite the muddled mess and there's very little to like, or horrify.  Zombie attempts to create a Michael Myers back-story is totally uninteresting, borderline boring, and 100% unbelievable.  I appreciate the effort, but it simply doesn't work.  The over the top characters and acting that worked so well in Devil's simply falls flat here and seems entirely out of place. Unfortunately, the movie never finds it pacing, and isn't able to generate an iota of suspense.  On the upside, fabulous to see the wonderful Dee Wallace on the screen, she's terrific.

My mum loves the original movies for some reason, but I just never saw the appeal.When I was asked to go and see the Rob Zombie 'remake', I was sceptical to say the least. I didn't remember too much of the original, the occasional scene here and there. But I do like Rob Zombie movies, and own House of 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects. He at least seemed like a good choice to do a remake, even if it was unnecessary.The movie starts with a young Michael Myers at home with his mum (Sheri Moon Zombie), his older sister, his baby sister, and his deadbeat stepfather. His stepfather and mother have many screaming matches during the opening scenes, and Michael seems to be caught up in all this. His older sister doesn't seem to care about him, his younger sister doesn't have a clue what's going on, and his mother would care about him if she wasn't constantly trying to clear up after his stepfather and doing her poledancing job. The sister's promiscuous, and looks to follow in the footsteps of her mother with a deadbeat boyfriend.I won't reveal anything more about the movie, for those who haven't seen it (but you need to go and see it). Sheri Moon's role is unfortunately, not as long as her previous movies, but she's still terrific, if getting a tad skinny.What shocked me about this version of Halloween, is that I actually found myself sympathising with Michael's character. With the whole build up as to what started him off killing (what do you expect with that family?), Rob Zombie does give the impression that he's trying to give Michael a heart, a conscience. The other strange thing is that after the age of 10, you never see Michael's face. He's hiding his face behind his hair, and eventually, the infamous mask, and you desperately try to picture a grown up Michael, but it didn't work for me, I always ended up picturing a 10-year-old's face behind the mask.The film does start to stutter when it skips to the present day, which I think was supposed to be set in the mid nineties, and it did start to go on a go slow for me.Halloween I didn't think was scary, much the same as I thought about the original. But it's so, so, so gory, it's unbelievable. A teenage girl (the actress was in her late twenties) lying topless, stabbed numerous times, still alive. A man, with his throat slashed, still desperately trying to work out what has happened, as the blood bubbles down his front. Bleurgh.There's a great cast in this, of course including Sheri Moon Zombie, Brad Dourif (unrecognisable from his role as Billy in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest), Malcolm McDowell, and look out for Captain Spaulding too. Hehe.There is nudity in this - pretty, pert, perky teenage girls rolling around in bed with deadbeat men, and sending their men out for beer. Watch out for one funny bit, where the 'boyfriend' walks back in with the beer, and the girl doesn't even notice he's grown about a foot and a half in a few minutes. Hello, you'd think that would be obvious! Now get your chest off the screen and die already.Halloween 2007 is definitely superior to the 1978 version in my opinion. Many, many reviewers are going to heavily disagree with me on that point, and I've already seen my fair share of one star reviews. But it's not a bad movie. It's well worth seeing, and believe me, if you don't find it scary, you will be turning your face away from the screen when someone gets their throat cut.",4,"I have to admit, I wasn't a fan of the original Halloween",1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,3528,"['fact', 'was', 'actually', 'bored', 'first', 'Halloween', 'never', 'bothered', 'watch', 'MANY', 'sequels', 'mum', 'original', 'movies', 'reason', 'just', 'never', 'saw', 'appeal.When', 'was', 'asked', 'go', 'see', 'Rob', 'Zombie', ""'remake"", 'was', 'sceptical', 'say', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'too', 'much', 'original', 'occasional', 'scene', 'here', 'there', 'do', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'movies', 'own', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'least', 'seemed', 'good', 'choice', 'do', 'remake', 'even', 'was', 'unnecessary.The', 'movie', 'young', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'home', 'mum', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'older', 'sister', 'baby', 'sister', 'deadbeat', 'stepfather', 'stepfather', 'mother', 'have', 'many', 'screaming', 'matches', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Michael', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'older', 'sister', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'younger', 'sister', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'going', 'mother', 'would', 'care', 'was', ""n't"", 'constantly', 'trying', 'clear', 'up', 'stepfather', 'doing', 'poledancing', 'job', 'sister', 'promiscuous', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'mother', 'deadbeat', 'boyfriend.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'anything', 'more', 'movie', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'need', 'go', 'see', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'role', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'as', 'long', 'previous', 'movies', 'still', 'terrific', 'getting', 'tad', 'skinny.What', 'shocked', 'version', 'Halloween', 'actually', 'found', 'sympathising', 'Michael', 'character', 'whole', 'build', 'up', 'as', 'what', 'started', 'off', 'killing', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'family', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'give', 'impression', 'trying', 'give', 'Michael', 'heart', 'conscience', 'other', 'strange', 'thing', 'age', '10', 'never', 'see', 'Michael', 'face', 'hiding', 'face', 'hair', 'eventually', 'infamous', 'mask', 'desperately', 'try', 'picture', 'grown', 'up', 'Michael', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'always', 'ended', 'up', 'picturing', '10-year-old', 'face', 'mask.The', 'film', 'start', 'stutter', 'when', 'present', 'day', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', 'mid', 'nineties', 'did', 'start', 'go', 'go', 'slow', 'me.Halloween', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'scary', 'much', 'same', 'thought', 'original', 'so', 'so', 'gory', 'unbelievable', 'teenage', 'girl', 'actress', 'was', 'late', 'twenties', 'lying', 'topless', 'stabbed', 'numerous', 'times', 'still', 'alive', 'man', 'throat', 'slashed', 'still', 'desperately', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'blood', 'bubbles', 'down', 'front', 'Bleurgh.There', 'great', 'cast', 'course', 'including', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'unrecognisable', 'role', 'Billy', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'look', 'out', 'Captain', 'Spaulding', 'too', 'Hehe.There', 'nudity', 'pretty', 'pert', 'perky', 'teenage', 'girls', 'rolling', 'around', 'bed', 'deadbeat', 'men', 'sending', 'men', 'out', 'beer', 'Watch', 'out', 'one', 'funny', 'bit', 'where', ""'boyfriend"", 'walks', 'back', 'beer', 'girl', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'grown', 'foot', 'half', 'few', 'minutes', 'Hello', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'obvious', 'Now', 'get', 'chest', 'screen', 'die', 'already.Halloween', '2007', 'definitely', 'superior', '1978', 'version', 'opinion', 'Many', 'many', 'reviewers', 'are', 'going', 'heavily', 'disagree', 'point', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'fair', 'share', 'one', 'star', 'reviews', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'believe', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'scary', 'will', 'be', 'turning', 'face', 'away', 'screen', 'when', 'someone', 'throat', 'cut']",Halloween
1102607,A2QXSGZOQRXL4Y,B000VKL6Z2,Melissa A. Greschner,"[2, 2]","This is another classic hit remade by Rob Zombie.  I've noticed in all of his films he carries his cast around; this one, House of a 1000 Corpses, Devil's Rejects... they all seem to play a vital role.  I like the back story to Michael Myers that Rob Zombie came up with.  It's very important to establish where or how someone became who they are today and I think Rob did a nice job in showing us why Michael is Michael.  His home life not being so great, his mother played by none other than Sheri Moon (Rob's wife) is a exotic dancer, the father figure is a pig, and his sister is your normal average teenage daughter... it's like what a life.On another note, I don't know if any one was aware that the character Annie Brackett, Lori Strodes best friend is played by none other than Danielle Harris who also plays as young Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers.  At first glance she was just another Hollywood face but when I looked closer I noticed that she played the little girl in 4 & 5 that was out at the farm house where there was the party and people were being killed one by one.  It's kind of ironic that Zombie would pick her, knowing she had a history with Halloween.  Plus for her to be killed and pratically nude in the 2007 movie, shows that closure was needed somehow.  But that's my opinion.All and all, I enjoyed this horror flick.... as I am a HORROR Lover.

Anyone else would have tore this masterpiece apart. Everything that plagued his first two movie's is completely gone here. The acting is definitely a step up from his previous flick's, he ditched the hand-cam for a steady-cam for most of the scene's, and all the effect's are good old fashoined prosthetic's and fake blood. The backstory on Michael Myers is done really well, and Daeg Faerchs' (little Michaels') performance is very good considering his age. It was also fun idea to think what Myers might have been like as a little boy. For most of the movie it is all backstory, and it is a completely different film than the original Halloween.

1102610,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B000VKL6Z2,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[20, 27]","My first reaction to Rob Zombie's remake of HALLOWEEN was: ""Why?"" The film is near-perfect as it is, and didn't need to be remade or, as the idiotic studio-suit buzzword goes, ""re-imagined."" But what the hell. Since Hollywood isn't interested in new ideas, and Zombie has apparently run out of such ideas as he has, I guess it was inevitable. This leads me to my second reaction, post-watching-the-film, which is, ""Is Rob Zombie a f-ing idiot or what? Doesn't he get why this was a good movie in the first place?""I don't say this to be abusive. I do believe Zombie has some talent and aesthetic style. The problem is that his style - at least as it pertains to HALLOWEEN -- is the wrong one. You don't use a sledgehammer to do a flyswatter's job, and you don't let a sadistic, gore-infatuated fanboy direct a horror masterpiece. The original HALLOWEEN was great for a lot of reasons, but chief among them, it didn't overanalyze its villain. And this is the real point that needs to be made here, because what Zombie does to his HALLOWEEN is part of an much wider and sillier trend in modern horror - the need to provide a reason why its killers do what they do.If I had to sum up the original, John Carpenter-directed version of the film in one phrase, it would be this: ""Yes, Virginia, there really is a Boogeyman."" That's basically it. The motivations of the film's masked, mouth-breathing murderer, Michael Myers, are never explained to any meaningful degree, because - gasp! - they don't have a rational explanation. Michael doesn't get an ""origin story""; no insight is provided as to why he murdered his sister Judith as a young boy, or why he's re-enacting the crime on a much larger scale as an adult. He's killing Because. Just BECAUSE. That's as much why as you get. It's almost Biblical. (""Who are you?"" Moses asks the burning bush. ""Who I AM."" God replies. ""I Am Who I AM."") As Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) explains to the Sheriff, Michael is not so much a human being as an embodiment of Evil itself, a Bad Thing that Happens to Good People. He's the Book of Job in a William Shatner mask. (That's why, incidentally, he's credited at the end of the film not as Michael Myers, but as ""The Shape"": he's taken the shape of your fears, whatever they might be.) But HALLOWEEN is not less scary for this lack of information. Quite the contrary. It's scarier precisely because we don't get the satisfaction. There is no ""Why?"" where Michael is concerned. He just Is.Zombie isn't satisfied with that answer, and so he's approached the film from a different angle - the angle of the ""origin story."" Here, Michael's origin is that as a child, he was abused, neglected, picked-on, and basically f'd from birth. As a result, he developed into an unspeaking, sadistic, remorseless killer. Very neat. Very plausible. And completely missing the point. Because by reducing Michael to a set of influences, mere cause and effect, he's also taking away nearly all his power as a villain. There's a reason we don't look behind the curtain in Oz; we might discover the Wizard is a sweaty dwarf on a treadmill. That's not cool. That's boring. And so is this film. Because not only does Zombie ruin the best aspect of HALLOWEEN - the almost-supernatural Boogeyman angle - he also viciously stomps the other aspect that made the original special -  its sense of restraint. Carpenter had enough sense to understand that what is left out of a movie is often just as important as what is left in. Instead of a few perfectly set-up and executed murders, we get a gigantic massacre that quickly numbs. Instead of a few drops of blood, we get buckets of steaming gore (always the first refuge of the hack who can't actually scare his audience). Instead of long cat-and-mouse games with totally unsuspecting victims that rack up the tension to an unbearable degree, climaxing in sudden death, we get drawn-out bludgeonings, followed by nonfatal stabbings, followed by near-escapes, followed by more bludgeonings and finally, fatal stabbings. Zombie's complete lack of subtlety, his refusal to leave anything to the imagination, isn't just bad film-making in and of itself; it's completely unsuited to the telling of this particular tale. Using him to do a HALLOWEEN remake is like using a rusty chainsaw to perform eye surgery.I suppose you could make an argument that since this is a remake (excuse me, a ""re-imagining""), Zombie was entitled, even obligated, to go in a different direction than Carpenter, one which has Dr. Loomis actually apologizing to Michael for ""failing"" him instead of blasting him with a .38, 'cause tha's what you do with Pure Evil when you find it. But even here the film falls down, because if Michael is a pure sociopath, as Malcom McDowell's version of Loomis maintains, Loomis has little to apologize for. See, while the jury's still out about whether a psychopath/sociopath can be actually be ""made"" in childhood (as opposed to simply ""born wrong"") there is universal agreement that neither sociopathy nor psychopathy are actually curable. How can a doctor fail the incurable? And this brings us back to the whole idea that made Carpenter's flick scary: that pure Evil is something outside of human influence, happening on its own terms for its own reasons and not subject to psychological analysis or treatment. (Donald Pleasance's Loomis ultimately got that Michael couldn't be ""reached"" - except by bullets.) Put simply, the genius of the original HALLOWEEN is that it ducked all the moral-psychological elements Zombie embraces and concentrated on one simple idea, best summed up by the last two lines of dialogue in the film:LAURIE STRODE: (sobbing) Was that the Boogeyman?DR.

It may be unfair, but it is inevitable.  So, with the remake of a movie as good and as well known as Halloween, Rob Zombie was stepping into some very big shoes.  What was interesting to me, is how the portions of the movie that had nothing to do with the original were far more interesting to me than those which were a remake.  While nothing necessarily unique, watching Mike Myers as a young boy, with all sorts of problems, mental and social, was rather interesting.  In some ways, leaving this movie as a prequel rather than a prequel/remake would have been advised.  Once the movie decided to become a remake I largely lost interest, knowing who was going to die, and constantly feeling that it had been done before dragged the movie down a notch.  When Laurie finally asks ""Was that the boogie man?"" I cringed, as it felt so out of place, and a forced nod to the original.It's a shame really that the remake portion detracted from the what could have otherwise been something interesting.  I think Rob Zombie had shown some real darkness and great film making in the dark and sadistic devil's rejects, and was hoping for more from this.  While I got some interesting moments, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.  Maybe his sequel will cure the defects of the remake, and stick to being its own entity.

Remaining basically loyal to the original and tampering with the basic plot in only minor ways, Zombie's contribution is to provide a back story to the famous serial killer that simultaneously makes him more human and more unnatural...and therefore much scarier!Unfortunately, the Unrated Director's Cut on DVD is not the same film that was offered to horror fans in theaters. More than just added footage that had to be cut in order to receive an ""R"" rating by the MPAA, this Unrated edition actually contains alternate scenes that replace the theatrical ones and, in many ways, make the offering a totally different film. Unfortunately, the alternate scene on the DVD that explains how Michael Myers escapes from the sanitarium is much weaker than the one used in the theatrical version, and it therefore makes the film on this DVD a much weaker flick. Alas, the original scene is not even included as an extra on the disk and is missing altogether, and a few fans that missed the film in the theater run don't realize they are watching a different film.Rob Zombie deserves the kudos he's been getting for creating a fantastic new vision with his remake, but sadly the film for which he earned those kudos is not the one on the Unrated Director's Cut DVD.  Zombie should be chastised NOT delivering that great remake to his fans for home viewing.The four-star rating is for this DVD, not the real film fans saw in theaters last fall.  Alas, Zombie's true work of art is currently only offered in the vsiually butchered 1.33:1 Wal-Mart Trailer-trash version, but fans won't find it on the Unrated Director's Cut.

The result? It's a more brutal film, especially when no blood is being shed. Example: A thoroughly bummed-out and disillusioned young Michael Myers sits on a curb on Halloween night, in costume, as the other kids go frolicking by. Nazareth's ""Love Hurts"" plays in the background while Zombie ping-pongs between shots of Michael and his stripper mom (Sheri Moon Zombie) working the pole at the local dive bar. It's a master stroke, the kind of thing Rob seems to do so well and so effortlessly...how DO you show sympathy toward a character that's largely unsympathetic?Another smart decision was to have Malcom McDowell in the role of Dr. Loomis. If you're familiar with the backstory of the original Halloween films, you know that the late Donald Pleasance has been credited as the ""mojo"" behind those films, an established actor who graciously became involved at a lower pay rate than he was accustomed to because he believed in Carpenter and his story. McDowell does his own thing here. He does not ""reinvent"" the role as much as he expands on it, just like the movie expands on John Carpenter's foundation.The ""Zombie Regulars"" are here, and it adds to the squirm factor to see Danielle Harris from ""Halloween 4"" and Halloween 5"" in the role of Myers victim Annie Brackett. Scout Taylor-Compton plays the role of Laurie Strode more like a teenager and less like an adult...she's definitely not channelling Jamie Lee Curtis on any level, and that's a good thing. It was a brilliant move to have Sid Haig and Bill Moseley in relatively minor, supporting roles...it thoroughly obliterates any temptation to compare the film to ""The Devil's Rejects"" (there IS no comparison...they are two completely different movies).Some people will feel that the movie never should have been made, others (like myself) had no choice but to watch it based on the strength of Mr. Zombie's two previous directorial efforts.

Rob Zombie does just that in this biography, not remake, of horror icon Michael Myers.  I would also guess that more Americans have probably heard of the fictional, Michael Myers, than Amin, or Lucas.Zombie's Halloween goes into detail of Michael as a child, while there is still something of a child left, and the hell on earth that exists in many households.  Michael Myers will become the manifestation of evil in society.  Halloween was reminiscent of David Cronenberg'sThe Broodand how the mother's anger physically manifested itself as she spawned deformed children to seek out what angered her.  Unlike the mother in The Brood Michael doesn't lash out at society but becomes the evil in society and eventually will no longer be human.  True evil cannot be stopped with a gun or a knife and neither can Michael Myers.My point is Zombie's film can be looked at as poetic and a message for non violence (you think I'm crazy).  Michael Myers is a metaphor for the evil in our society, specifically the evil that hides in the suburbs behind closed doors.  Myers uses a mask to hide this evil as suburbs could mask this with white picket fence as a happy front. If you can't use violence to stop this evil as we do in our society then you have to go to the roots, the family and family values.  Similarly the bookThree Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace . . . One School at a Timewhich uses education to fight terror where it starts and not bombs.There are two moments in the film where, Michael Myers, the boy fights that evil.  The first, after Michael has murdered his family and is locked away in an institution he has an emotional breakdown with Dr. Loomis at Christmas time.  Michael for an instant realizes the situation and is terrified this reminded me of Regan inThe Exorcist (25th Anniversary Special Edition)as the demon left her.  Flash to the next scene and Michael is gone and the evil has taken him.  The second moment after Michael has kidnapped Laurie he once again becomes human for a  moment, drops his knife, and shows his face to his sister, once Laurie stabs him and he puts the mask back on Michael is now dead and there is only evil.Zombie has a stellar cast of horror veterans that there are too many to list.  Zombie does not use this as a gimmick or to wink at horror fans the film is taken seriously from beginning to end and their are solid performances all around.  Rob Zombie seems to get better with each film as does his wife Sheri Moon Zombie who gave a solid performance as Michael's mother.  The photograph that is shown at the end was very effective and tragic.DVD FEATURESOn Amazon it says the theatrical version is presented in Full Screen only but Disc I contains both Full Screen and Wide Screen versions. - Feature commentary by Writer/Director Rob Zombie as well.Disc IIAlternate Ending - Deleted Scenes with optional Directory's commentary - Bloopers- The Many Masks of Michael Myers - Re Imagining Halloween - Meet the cast - Casting Sessions - Laurie Strode Scree Test - Theatrical Trailer.I have seen both the unrated and theatrical versions and theatrical version is the one to go with by a mile.  The unrated just throws in to many over the top incidents that really aren't needed.",5,Not a remake but a biopic.  Which version to buy (Theatrical does have widescreen).

1102619,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B000VKL6Z2,Mike S.,"[2, 2]","There generally are two camps for this movie. People who hate it and think it should never have been made and people who love it. I am actually somewhat in between. Although I do lean toward liking it, it is not as good as the original. There is a definite effort here to establish a back story for Michael and to try to explain why he turned out the way he did. Whether it works or falls flat is pretty much a matter of subjectivity. Part of what made the character scary is that there was no explanation in the first one for why he killed his sister in the beginning. In this one you get the impression that he kills her because she is mean to him and does not take him Trick or Treating on Halloween. He also kills the sister's boyfriend and alcoholic step dad. I do however like how they showed how the mom reacted to everything. I also liked how they developed the Loomis Meyers relationship over time.Once the 15 year time jump happens the film stays closer to the original, but is not a shot for shot remake. While some of the scenes and lines from the original are recreated, it is ultimately a different movie. Some people like that and some hate that, but if you are expecting an exact remake of the original movie you will not get it.The two things I did not like about the movie was how they kind of made Loomis into a publicity seeker (by having him write the book) and that only gets worse in the sequel to this. I also did not like the casting for the adult Michael. Tyler Mane is a 6'7"" ex pro wrestler. Part of what made Michael Myers scary in the first place was the fact that he was a normal size guy who could not be stopped. You take a 6'7"" guy who can throw people around like a rag doll and you automatically think unstoppable, and it is laughable when anyone tries to fight back. That may have been what they were going for, but when you have a guy that cannot be knocked down then you lose the dramatic effect of him getting back up.I did like the casting otherwise. I thought Scout Taylor Compton did a good job as Laurie, although she was not the meek character that Jamie Lee Curtis played in the first film. However given that this was made three decades later, they really did have to update how the teenagers and even the younger kids acted to make it something that would appeal to the audience. I also liked how they gave Danielle Harris (the little girl from Halloween 4 and 5) a large role in this movie.There is also a lot more gore in this one than the original. One of the hallmarks of the first movie is that there was very little blood. Given today's horror movie climate, and who was directing the movie, there was of course going to be a lot more blood and gore in this one. By now anyone who was likely to see this already has. But if you have not, then I would say if you are a fan of the series and do not have a how dare they mess with the original attitude, then check this out. If the though of a remake makes you wince then probably skip it.",4,A retelling of the story with its own twists,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,2990,"['generally', 'are', 'two', 'camps', 'movie', 'People', 'who', 'hate', 'think', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'am', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'do', 'lean', 'liking', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'definite', 'effort', 'here', 'establish', 'back', 'story', 'Michael', 'try', 'explain', 'why', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'did', 'Whether', 'flat', 'pretty', 'much', 'matter', 'subjectivity', 'Part', 'what', 'made', 'character', 'scary', 'was', 'explanation', 'first', 'one', 'why', 'killed', 'sister', 'beginning', 'one', 'get', 'impression', 'mean', 'not', 'take', 'Trick', 'Treating', 'Halloween', 'also', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'alcoholic', 'step', 'dad', 'do', 'however', 'how', 'showed', 'how', 'mom', 'reacted', 'everything', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'developed', 'Loomis', 'Meyers', 'relationship', 'time.Once', '15', 'year', 'time', 'jump', 'film', 'closer', 'original', 'not', 'shot', 'shot', 'remake', 'scenes', 'lines', 'original', 'are', 'recreated', 'ultimately', 'different', 'movie', 'people', 'hate', 'are', 'expecting', 'exact', 'remake', 'original', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'it.The', 'two', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'kind', 'made', 'Loomis', 'publicity', 'seeker', 'having', 'write', 'book', 'only', 'worse', 'sequel', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'casting', 'adult', 'Michael', 'Tyler', 'Mane', '6', '7', 'ex', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'Part', 'what', 'made', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'scary', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'normal', 'size', 'guy', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'stopped', 'take', '6', '7', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'throw', 'people', 'rag', 'doll', 'automatically', 'think', 'unstoppable', 'laughable', 'when', 'anyone', 'fight', 'back', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'when', 'have', 'guy', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'knocked', 'down', 'then', 'lose', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'getting', 'back', 'up.I', 'did', 'casting', 'otherwise', 'thought', 'Scout', 'Taylor', 'Compton', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Laurie', 'was', 'not', 'meek', 'character', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'played', 'first', 'film', 'However', 'given', 'was', 'made', 'three', 'decades', 'later', 'really', 'did', 'have', 'update', 'how', 'teenagers', 'even', 'younger', 'kids', 'acted', 'make', 'something', 'would', 'appeal', 'audience', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'gave', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'little', 'girl', 'Halloween', '4', '5', 'large', 'role', 'movie.There', 'also', 'lot', 'more', 'gore', 'one', 'original', 'One', 'hallmarks', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'blood', 'Given', 'today', 'horror', 'movie', 'climate', 'who', 'was', 'directing', 'movie', 'was', 'course', 'going', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'blood', 'gore', 'one', 'now', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'likely', 'see', 'already', 'have', 'not', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'how', 'dare', 'mess', 'original', 'attitude', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'though', 'remake', 'wince', 'then', 'probably', 'skip']",Halloween

Although I always thought that the original film left gaps in the story...why was Michael the way he was?...yes, Rob answered this for us folks, but how difficult it was to watch this poor boy living in this over the top dysfunctional home! It makes sense to the story, but I found it too disturbing to watch. He was a much more believable Michael, we understood where he was coming from, his pain was too huge for a young child to handle...but did I really want to know these details and suffer along with this young boy?  Heck, no! To top it all off, Zombie movies (which I should have known!) are far too grotesque and bloody for my taste.  The original movie had just the right amount of gore, suspense, scary music and fear.  I didn't need to be taken to the next level of horror, so I shut the movie off.  I never finished it because what I had seen was more than enough.  I wondered, afterward, about our society and what makes us love these type of movies.  If these horrific events happened to anyone we knew, we wouldn't be so anxious to watch them on the big screen. The fact is that the world is hard enough, scary enough, dark enough...we hardly need to be on a journey of insanity for two hours and then watch the bonus features so we can see more about how they made the gore fest come to life!

The constant swearing (this coming from a guy who watched HBO's Deadwood) was way too frequent in the first twenty minutes. Thankfully that thinned out as the story progressed. It felt too much like the recent Texas Chainsaw remakes for my tastes. The acting wasn't as bad as most critics are saying and some of the dialogue actually made me laugh a bit. This is a very brutal movie to say the least. Even when Rob doesn't show a lot of gore, the way he films some of the murders is flat out disturbing (especially the ones involving young Michael).I'm glad he kept the famous music and didn't shy away from showing some nudity. The MPAA seems to feel that showing a little skin is worse than peeling it off someone and deep frying it.

The last hour basically picks up where we get a lot of redone scenes from the original. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was all well done...but scenes like the ""ghost sheet"" scene and others being included make me wonder what Rob might have come up with on his own. If there is a sequel, we might find out!As far as director commentary, Rob delivers again with some pretty cool insights on the movie and the extras are a lot of fun. I'm not sure if Rob would do another remake, but Friday the 13th could use it. Once the franchise veered off to Manhatten, then Hell, and even into the future in Outer Space, it was time for someone to wake up.",4,"The Jokes Over, time to get scared....",1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,1452,"['Michael', 'Myers', 'finally', 'getting', 'makeover', 'need', 'quite', 'time', 'Just', 'Mr.', 'Voorhees', 'Michael', 'become', 'more', 'joke', 'studios', 'continue', 'crank', 'out', 'umpteenth', 'installment', 'slasher', 'film', 'make', 'minimal', 'profits', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'young', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'growing', 'up', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'very', 'entertaining', 'stuff.The', 'return', 'classical', 'characters', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'was', 'fine', 'was', 'critical', 'overall', 'history', 'felt', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Rob', 'had', 'just', 'created', 'new', 'characters', 'keeping', 'historical', 'facts', 'concerning', 'Michael', 'intact', 'see', 'when', 'Rob', 'used', 'creative', 'license', 'fill', 'gaps', 'young', 'Michael', 'growing', 'up', 'time', 'mental', 'institute', 'movie', 'lot', 'fresher', 'fun', 'watch', 'last', 'hour', 'basically', 'up', 'where', 'get', 'lot', 'redone', 'scenes', 'original', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'scenes', 'ghost', 'sheet', 'scene', 'others', 'being', 'included', 'make', 'wonder', 'what', 'Rob', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'sequel', 'might', 'find', 'out', 'As', 'far', 'director', 'commentary', 'Rob', 'delivers', 'again', 'pretty', 'cool', 'insights', 'movie', 'extras', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Rob', 'would', 'do', 'remake', 'Friday', '13th', 'could', 'use', 'franchise', 'veered', 'Manhatten', 'then', 'Hell', 'even', 'future', 'Outer', 'Space', 'was', 'time', 'someone', 'wake', 'up']",Halloween
1102629,A1UJV4Y9IHNVXQ,B000VKL6Z2,MovieManTN,"[9, 13]","As a true long-time fan of the original Carpenter ""Halloween"", and a true skeptic of most of the current remakes of classics, I was a little hesitant about wanting to see this remake.  However, knowing that if I disliked it I could just erase it from memory, I went in to the theater to see this with an open mind.  I also kept in mind that as long as the original is still available to be seen, it DOESN'T MATTER if the remake was not up to par.  The original is still there to be seen.  I have to say that after seeing Rob Zombie's vision of this story, I was blown away.  I was a huge fan of ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"", and was definitely NOT disappointed in the re-imagining of the Michael Myers story.That being said, I have to say I honestly do not know what people who loathe this reinvention expected.  There is such hatred towards this movie that I do not understand.  If anyone has seen any of Rob Zombie's previous works, they should have known going in that this was going to be a BRUTAL and graphically realistic movie.  The comparisons to Carpenter's building of suspense are baffling....Zombie is known for the more ""in your face"" brutality and edginess...nothing else should have been expected.If you're familiar with Zombie's previous works, you will love this movie.  If you want the more subtle, subdued suspense that the 1978 original offered (which I also loved), then this is probably not the movie for you.  However, if you've not seen the Rob Zombie ""Halloween"", please do not post a negative review just on what you've heard or what you've felt about the remake UNLESS you HAVE seen it.  I feel there are a lot of posts on here from people who haven't seen it and just want to give it negative reviews based on the fact that they are upset that a remake of the classic was done.",4,Terrific update on the classic,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,1827,"['true', 'long-time', 'fan', 'original', 'Carpenter', 'Halloween', 'true', 'skeptic', 'most', 'current', 'remakes', 'classics', 'was', 'little', 'hesitant', 'wanting', 'see', 'remake', 'However', 'knowing', 'disliked', 'could', 'just', 'erase', 'memory', 'went', 'theater', 'see', 'open', 'mind', 'also', 'kept', 'mind', 'as', 'long', 'original', 'still', 'available', 'be', 'seen', ""N'T"", 'MATTER', 'remake', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'original', 'still', 'be', 'seen', 'have', 'say', 'seeing', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'vision', 'story', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'House', '1,000', 'Corpses', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'was', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'disappointed', 're-imagining', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'story.That', 'being', 'said', 'have', 'say', 'honestly', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'people', 'who', 'loathe', 'reinvention', 'expected', 'such', 'hatred', 'towards', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'anyone', 'seen', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'previous', 'works', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'going', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'BRUTAL', 'graphically', 'realistic', 'movie', 'comparisons', 'Carpenter', 'building', 'suspense', 'are', 'baffling', '.Zombie', 'known', 'more', 'face', 'brutality', 'edginess', 'nothing', 'else', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'expected.If', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Zombie', 'previous', 'works', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'want', 'more', 'subtle', 'subdued', 'suspense', '1978', 'original', 'offered', 'also', 'loved', 'then', 'probably', 'not', 'movie', 'However', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'post', 'negative', 'review', 'just', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'what', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'remake', 'UNLESS', 'HAVE', 'seen', 'feel', 'are', 'lot', 'posts', 'here', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'just', 'want', 'give', 'negative', 'reviews', 'based', 'fact', 'are', 'upset', 'remake', 'classic', 'was', 'done']",Halloween
1102630,A7K2V3AJIAC63,B000VKL6Z2,Movie Reviewer,"[15, 20]","This movie was absolutely horrible. I am such a big fan of the original version, but this one made me want to cry.When I think of Halloween, there are many things that should have been incorporated into the movie. First, the scene where Micheal wears a sheet and glasses (which he does in this movie). Everything else was missing. There sould have been a scene where Laurie was in the closet and Micheal tried to get her. One other important thing is only being able to see his mask, as if it were floating in mid air. No scenes like this. Instead, they make him to be more like Jason from Friday the 13th. I love the Friday the 13th franchise, but his is Halloween. Micheal lurks in the shadows and surprises his victims, he does not use brute strength to tear through everything to get to the victim. I enjoyed the backstory idea, but I didn't like how they made his family trailer trash.I really liked the young girl who played Laurie Strode. I am really happy that Rob Zombie did not make her like she was in the original version. In all honesty, there is no 17 year old girls like that in 2007. I am glad he made her spunky instead of Amish.I also really liked how the mask was all aged and dilapidated. These were the only two good parts of the movie.One things that really bothers me is that I felt like I was back in freaking 1972 throughout the entire movie. Every single male character had long hair. I thought they were all in a bad 1970 rock band. I understand that the movie probably starts out in the 80's, so the long hair would be expected. But when it is in present day, come on. Every single movie that Zombie makes is like a freaking music video because all the guys are like rock stars with long hair. THIS IS 2007.Another things that bugs me is, yet again, this movie has the same cast from House 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects. I honestly have not seen another movie with these actors in it, and there is probably a good reason for that: THEY CAN'T ACT. The exception is Sherri-Moon Zombie. I actually really liked her in this movie. But the rest, come on. They are freaking Z-List celebrities.And lastly, I do not consider this a horror movie. I consider this a porn movie with Micheal Myers as a side character. Every five minutes there is a sex scene with naked women running around. It was so gross. Even the scene when Micheal escapes the sanitarium is because of a gross sex scene. (which I don't understand why the two men wish to do what they did to the poor woman in Micheal's room. This was a very weak scene.) Almost all of the main characters that die in this movie die right after or during having sex. The sex scenes overshadow the gore scenes. I mean, Micheal will be in the middle of killing someone, and suddenly it skips to a sex scene. When we come back, there is blood EVERYWHERE, and we don't get to see how this happened. I would much rather see the blood shed, and less porn. I mean, if I wanted to see a porn movie, I would rent one.This movie was complete and utter trash. I really want everyone to watch the original Halloween instead of this stupid movie. Although, if you are in for a good porn flick, then I'd rent this one. But beware, the people in this movie aren't that attractive to look at!",1,Horrible.,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,3254,"['movie', 'was', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'version', 'one', 'made', 'want', 'cry.When', 'think', 'Halloween', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'incorporated', 'movie', 'First', 'scene', 'where', 'Micheal', 'sheet', 'glasses', 'movie', 'Everything', 'else', 'was', 'missing', 'sould', 'have', 'been', 'scene', 'where', 'Laurie', 'was', 'closet', 'Micheal', 'tried', 'get', 'One', 'other', 'important', 'thing', 'only', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'mask', 'were', 'floating', 'mid', 'air', 'scenes', 'Instead', 'make', 'be', 'more', 'Jason', 'Friday', '13th', 'love', 'Friday', '13th', 'franchise', 'Halloween', 'Micheal', 'shadows', 'victims', 'not', 'use', 'brute', 'strength', 'tear', 'everything', 'get', 'victim', 'enjoyed', 'backstory', 'idea', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'made', 'family', 'trailer', 'trash.I', 'really', 'liked', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'am', 'really', 'happy', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'was', 'original', 'version', 'honesty', '17', 'year', 'old', 'girls', '2007', 'am', 'glad', 'made', 'spunky', 'instead', 'Amish.I', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'mask', 'was', 'aged', 'dilapidated', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'good', 'parts', 'movie.One', 'things', 'really', 'bothers', 'felt', 'was', 'back', 'freaking', '1972', 'entire', 'movie', 'single', 'male', 'character', 'had', 'long', 'hair', 'thought', 'were', 'bad', '1970', 'rock', 'band', 'understand', 'movie', 'probably', 'out', '80', 'long', 'hair', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'when', 'present', 'day', 'come', 'Every', 'single', 'movie', 'Zombie', 'freaking', 'music', 'video', 'guys', 'are', 'rock', 'stars', 'long', 'hair', 'THIS', '2007.Another', 'things', 'bugs', 'yet', 'again', 'movie', 'same', 'cast', 'House', '1,000', 'Corpses', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'honestly', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'actors', 'probably', 'good', 'reason', 'THEY', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'ACT', 'exception', 'Sherri-Moon', 'Zombie', 'actually', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'rest', 'come', 'are', 'freaking', 'Z-List', 'celebrities.And', 'lastly', 'do', 'not', 'consider', 'horror', 'movie', 'consider', 'porn', 'movie', 'Micheal', 'Myers', 'side', 'character', 'five', 'minutes', 'sex', 'scene', 'naked', 'women', 'running', 'around', 'was', 'so', 'gross', 'Even', 'scene', 'when', 'Micheal', 'sanitarium', 'gross', 'sex', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'two', 'men', 'wish', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'poor', 'woman', 'Micheal', 'room', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'scene', 'main', 'characters', 'die', 'movie', 'die', 'right', 'having', 'sex', 'sex', 'scenes', 'gore', 'scenes', 'mean', 'Micheal', 'will', 'be', 'middle', 'killing', 'someone', 'suddenly', 'sex', 'scene', 'When', 'come', 'back', 'blood', 'EVERYWHERE', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'how', 'happened', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'see', 'blood', 'shed', 'less', 'porn', 'mean', 'wanted', 'see', 'porn', 'movie', 'would', 'rent', 'one.This', 'movie', 'was', 'complete', 'utter', 'trash', 'really', 'want', 'everyone', 'watch', 'original', 'Halloween', 'instead', 'stupid', 'movie', 'are', 'good', 'porn', 'flick', 'then', ""'d"", 'rent', 'one', 'beware', 'people', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'attractive', 'look']",Halloween
1102631,A1ER6IYOMM8VCT,B000VKL6Z2,"! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[1, 2]","I wanted to do the original Omen for my 666th review, but I have been wanting to watch this film for a long time. My review is for the unrated 3 disc set from Circuit City.I went into this film with the mind set that this was a Halloween movie from a parallel universe. If you want to enjoy this film, try not think of it as a remake....OK?...alright, here we go.This film is well produced and the first half deals with young Michael Myers at age 10. Although sort of interesting to watch, it really doesn't give us much more insight than the original on why he's so evil. Carpenter's film leaves  a lot to the imagination and we all know that what we conjure in our own minds is usually scarier than what we see on screen. This is a new Halloween and we get to see some brutal murders unlike the original. This isn't necessarily a bad a thing.....well,.... I usually don't complain (too much) about really stupid scenes in horror movies, but this film has some real bad ones! Michael is in the mental institution for brutal murders and yet he walks around unchained and is allowed to use forks and knives when he's eating! I guess so he can stab and kill a nurse who is left alone to watch him.Unlike the original in which ""The Shape"" was actually a slender man and or supernatural being, this guy is huge and should have been restrained in a straight jacket 24/7! I only mention this because it appears Zombie is trying to make this character more ""human"". Well that requires making sense throughout the film. When a couple of ""boneheads"" who work in the hospital try to have their way with a new young female patient, what do they do?........ well, they bring her over to Michael Myer's room where the gigantic lunatic(who loves to kill people)sits making his disturbing masks and they rape her with their backs turned to Mr. Myers! Then, they antagonize and hit Mr. Myers as if he isn't a threat! It's scenes like these that keep this from being a much better movie.I had no problem sitting through it's 2 hour time length, but I kept thinking how close Zombie came to making a good horror film. As it is,(at least the unrated version I saw), it's a 2 1/2 star horror film. Only in the last 25 minutes or so did it finally build some tension, something the original had in spades! The Michael Myers in this film does look menacing and the film has an upgraded slick look, so Zombie's heart was in the right place. Some things he got very wrong...Unlike the original, I didn't feel this film had anything to do with Halloween as it just seemed to be in the distant background of the film. Carpenter's version was all about Halloween. Also, making Myers a human nut job took a lot away from the unknown eerieness of the character in the original.The unrated edition has a great transfer and lots of extra goodies. My version had a third disc with the cast at comic con doing a question and answers gig. Now that I have seen the theatrical version, I would have to recommend it over the unrated one, even with some slightly trimmed down gore, it's a way better movie and makes more sense! I give the theatrical version 3 1/2 stars!",3,HALLOWEEN RE-VISITED THE UNRATED REVIEW! 2 1/2 STARS!,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,3132,"['wanted', 'do', 'original', 'Omen', '666th', 'review', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'watch', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'review', 'unrated', '3', 'disc', 'set', 'Circuit', 'City.I', 'went', 'film', 'mind', 'set', 'was', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'parallel', 'universe', 'want', 'enjoy', 'film', 'try', 'not', 'think', 'remake', '.OK', 'alright', 'here', 'go.This', 'film', 'well', 'produced', 'first', 'half', 'deals', 'young', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'age', '10', 'sort', 'interesting', 'watch', 'really', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'more', 'insight', 'original', 'why', 'so', 'evil', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'lot', 'imagination', 'know', 'what', 'conjure', 'own', 'minds', 'usually', 'scarier', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'new', 'Halloween', 'get', 'see', 'brutal', 'murders', 'original', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', '..well', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'really', 'stupid', 'scenes', 'horror', 'movies', 'film', 'real', 'bad', 'ones', 'Michael', 'mental', 'institution', 'brutal', 'murders', 'yet', 'around', 'unchained', 'allowed', 'use', 'forks', 'knives', 'when', 'eating', 'guess', 'so', 'can', 'stab', 'kill', 'nurse', 'who', 'left', 'alone', 'watch', 'original', 'Shape', 'was', 'actually', 'slender', 'man', 'supernatural', 'being', 'guy', 'huge', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'restrained', 'straight', 'jacket', '24/7', 'only', 'mention', 'Zombie', 'trying', 'make', 'character', 'more', 'human', 'Well', 'making', 'sense', 'film', 'When', 'couple', 'boneheads', 'who', 'work', 'hospital', 'try', 'have', 'way', 'new', 'young', 'female', 'patient', 'what', 'do', 'do', '..', 'well', 'bring', 'Michael', 'Myer', 'room', 'where', 'gigantic', 'lunatic', 'who', 'kill', 'people', 'making', 'disturbing', 'masks', 'rape', 'backs', 'turned', 'Mr.', 'Myers', 'Then', 'antagonize', 'hit', 'Mr.', 'Myers', ""n't"", 'threat', 'scenes', 'keep', 'being', 'much', 'better', 'movie.I', 'had', 'problem', 'sitting', '2', 'hour', 'time', 'length', 'kept', 'thinking', 'how', 'close', 'Zombie', 'came', 'making', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'least', 'unrated', 'version', 'saw', '2', '1/2', 'star', 'horror', 'film', 'Only', 'last', '25', 'minutes', 'so', 'did', 'finally', 'build', 'tension', 'something', 'original', 'had', 'spades', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'film', 'look', 'menacing', 'film', 'upgraded', 'slick', 'look', 'Zombie', 'heart', 'was', 'right', 'place', 'things', 'got', 'very', 'wrong', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'Halloween', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'distant', 'background', 'film', 'Carpenter', 'version', 'was', 'Halloween', 'Also', 'making', 'Myers', 'human', 'nut', 'job', 'took', 'lot', 'away', 'unknown', 'eerieness', 'character', 'original.The', 'unrated', 'edition', 'great', 'transfer', 'lots', 'extra', 'goodies', 'version', 'had', 'third', 'disc', 'cast', 'comic', 'con', 'doing', 'question', 'answers', 'gig', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'recommend', 'unrated', 'one', 'even', 'slightly', 'trimmed', 'down', 'gore', 'way', 'better', 'movie', 'more', 'sense', 'give', 'theatrical', 'version', '3', '1/2', 'stars']",Halloween

1102637,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000VKL6Z2,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[5, 7]","I hate remakes.  The horror genre has become a breeding ground for remakes and re-hashes of classic films in the genre, as is the case with Halloween.  As flawed as House of 1000 Corpses was, musician turned director Rob Zombie more than made up for it with The Devil's Rejects, which really seemed to find him coming into his own.  That's why I was looking forward to the Halloween remake, of which I had heard both great and terrible things about.  After viewing it, well, it's not nearly as terrible as what I had heard, but at the same time, the film is a needless remake that wastes much of it's potential.  The subtlety of John Carpenter's original classic is replaced with brutal violence and buckets of blood, as we witness the beginnings of Michael Myers' (played as a child by Daeg Faerch, and later by X-Men's Tyler Mane) journey to becoming a killer from his childhood on, as Zombie makes an attempt to give the viewer a sympathetic view towards Michael.  The relationship with Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) is further examined as well, as is Michael's return to Haddonfield.  The abundance of backstory and sympathetic view towards Michael Myers is where Halloween fails, but where it succeeds is with Zombie's techniques for getting the most out of the shocks and scares that he pummels the viewer with.  The final act, in which Michael faces off with Laurie Strode (the super cute Scout Taylor-Compton), is a visceral blast, as is what leads up to it.  As he has done before, Zombie has peppered genre stalwarts throughout the film, including his wife Sheri Moon, Brad Dourif, William Forsythe, Dee Wallace, Clint Howard, Udo Kier, Bill Moseley, Danny Trejo, Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree, Sid Haig, and an all grown up Danielle Harris, whose role here is a far cry from the petrified child of Halloween 4 and 5.  The two-disc Unrated edition features an insightful commentary from Zombie, plenty of deleted scenes (including Adrienne Barbeau's deleted role), a more downbeat alternate ending, and a pretty funny blooper reel.  Not for the faint of heart to be sure, Rob Zombie's Halloween remake isn't anything spectacular, but it's nothing terrible in the least either, and more than worth checking out for horror/slasher fans young and old alike.",3,"A needless, but entertaining, remake of a classic",1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,2263,"['hate', 'remakes', 'horror', 'genre', 'become', 'breeding', 'ground', 'remakes', 're-hashes', 'classic', 'films', 'genre', 'case', 'Halloween', 'As', 'flawed', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', 'was', 'musician', 'turned', 'director', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'really', 'seemed', 'find', 'coming', 'own', 'why', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'Halloween', 'remake', 'had', 'heard', 'great', 'terrible', 'things', 'viewing', 'well', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'terrible', 'what', 'had', 'heard', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'needless', 'remake', 'much', 'potential', 'subtlety', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'classic', 'replaced', 'brutal', 'violence', 'buckets', 'blood', 'witness', 'beginnings', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'played', 'child', 'Daeg', 'Faerch', 'later', 'X-Men', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'journey', 'becoming', 'killer', 'childhood', 'Zombie', 'attempt', 'give', 'viewer', 'sympathetic', 'view', 'Michael', 'relationship', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'further', 'examined', 'as', 'well', 'Michael', 'return', 'Haddonfield', 'abundance', 'backstory', 'sympathetic', 'view', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'where', 'Halloween', 'where', 'Zombie', 'techniques', 'getting', 'most', 'shocks', 'scares', 'viewer', 'final', 'act', 'Michael', 'off', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'super', 'cute', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'visceral', 'blast', 'what', 'up', 'done', 'before', 'Zombie', 'peppered', 'genre', 'stalwarts', 'film', 'including', 'wife', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'Udo', 'Kier', 'Bill', 'Moseley', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Ken', 'Foree', 'Sid', 'Haig', 'grown', 'up', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'role', 'here', 'far', 'cry', 'petrified', 'child', 'Halloween', '4', '5', 'two-disc', 'Unrated', 'edition', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'Zombie', 'plenty', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'deleted', 'role', 'more', 'downbeat', 'alternate', 'ending', 'pretty', 'funny', 'blooper', 'reel', 'Not', 'faint', 'heart', 'be', 'sure', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'remake', ""n't"", 'anything', 'spectacular', 'nothing', 'terrible', 'least', 'more', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'horror/slasher', 'fans', 'young', 'old', 'alike']",Halloween

I like it more every time I see it, much like the original film, which I still think is superior, but that is not to say that this film does not have it's merits.  It is a great film in its own right.  If the Carpenter film is about the evil that is unknown that is out there in the world, then Zombie's film is trying to make us look very hard into the idea of myth and history and what is really there.  Many people have seen this film as a biopic or trying to be to analytical of the original film, but I have to say that Zombie is trying to construct the mid american mysticism.  Most people in this country believe in ghosts.  It is because of religion and pop culture that we believe in things that allow us to look at a child murderer that is cute as a button and say, well, he must be possessed by a demon or a celtic deity.  The reality is that he probably came from an abusive home that is pretty typical in American life.  The film does not pick a particular period to be placed, but feels generally nostalgic of a memory of what American is supposed to be.I know a lot of reviewers have commented on the cursing.  There is no character development they say.  I am not so sure that kids that age have fully developed anything.  I remember my friends getting together and just cursing and telling dirty jokes because it masked our insecurity.  The articulate teen is the inner dialogue that we remember thinking in those situation that becomes the memory of what happened.  This film goes directly into the face of the memory of the America that was and deconstructs it and terrorizes it.I thought I should also comment on the director's cut vs. the theatrical cut.  Unlike many special editions, there is very little difference between the two films.  Some people have commented that the theatrical version is much better paced, while I myself prefer the director's cut in terms of message, but I can definitely see why people would prefer the other as it does flow better.  It is a shame that with all the different editions that have come out, that they haven't offered both versions of the film at the same time, but if I was only going to ever own one, I would go with the director's cut.  The reason that I have the theatrical cut on DVD as opposed to Blu Ray, which is the director's cut is on, is because if I am on the go, my DVD is more accessible.  The biggest difference being the escape sequence where Michael takes on several guards.  Another big difference is that Dr. Loomis dies in the theatrical version.  All this seems to focus on Michael as this unstoppable monster, where the slower pace of the director's cut focuses more on Michael as the victim.

On HALLOWEEN night while Deborah Myers is at the Rabbit In Red Lounge stripping, Michael kills Judith, her boyfriend, and Ronnie. He is transferred to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. During his years there, Dr. Loomis tries to help him, but he gets a lot worse, and I really feel sorry for Deborah when she realizes what a monster her son has become. 15 years later, Michael escapes and goes back to Haddonfield on HALLOWEEN. Throughout the day, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda see Michael stalking them. When Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, Annie makes Laurie watch Lindsey Wallace also. While Annie and her boyfriend, Paul are having sex, Michael strikes again, and waits for Laurie. Laurie finds Annie bloody, so she calls the police. Sheriff Brackett and Dr. Loomis hurry to the rescue, but Michael has already captured Laurie and taken her back to the Myers house. Will Laurie escape? Will Dr. Loomis find her in time?

1102653,A1PIFI7VXW78ZA,B000VKL6Z2,Ramon Olivo,"[3, 5]","What happens when you give a horror fanatic like Rob Zombie the liberty to do as he wishes on a horror franchise like John Carpenter's ""Halloween""? Unfortunately you get bored to death with one cliche ridden scene after another. What the hell happened? I didn't think his first two films were bad, not great, but not awful either. I figured the major problem here is the same deal you'll get from Tarantino or Rodriguez, they're film enthusiasts. They're better skilled at creating tributes to the films they love than adding any original ideas of their own. That being said the film isn't a complete remake. If you've seen the original ""Halloween"" you'll remember that it starts with Michael breaking out of the asylum. In the new revamp version Zombie, in the first act, gives us a glimpse of what Michael was like as a child and what led him to be locked away in an asylum in the first place. Oddly enough I think the first act (all the scenes that eventually lead into his killing spree) is excellent. I would have rather have seen a film about  a child growing up into the killer instead of just a simple explanation for the sake of exposition. Imagine what a riskier and much more controversial film that would have been! And what a way to reawaken the franchise which was originally hit or miss anyhow. Regardless, once Michael escapes the asylum we are treated to simple slasher film clich&eacute;s with no rhyme or reason for half the killings. Were any of these people in his way in the first place? How does he know to find his sister? Basically he just goes on a killing spree for the sake of a killing spree and several times I found myself yawning and losing interest. Forget about tension because without that rhyme and reason you get none. I wanted to enjoy this film but it was a total let down.Credit to Rob Zombie for having the original Misfits ""Halloween"" play in the background.",2,Who Let Rob Zombie Write This?!,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,1900,"['What', 'when', 'give', 'horror', 'fanatic', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'liberty', 'do', 'horror', 'franchise', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Halloween', 'Unfortunately', 'get', 'bored', 'death', 'one', 'cliche', 'ridden', 'scene', 'What', 'hell', 'happened', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'awful', 'either', 'figured', 'major', 'problem', 'here', 'same', 'deal', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Tarantino', 'Rodriguez', ""'re"", 'film', 'enthusiasts', ""'re"", 'better', 'skilled', 'creating', 'tributes', 'films', 'love', 'adding', 'original', 'ideas', 'own', 'being', 'said', 'film', ""n't"", 'complete', 'remake', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'Halloween', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'Michael', 'breaking', 'asylum', 'new', 'revamp', 'version', 'Zombie', 'first', 'act', 'glimpse', 'what', 'Michael', 'was', 'child', 'led', 'be', 'locked', 'away', 'asylum', 'first', 'place', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'think', 'first', 'act', 'scenes', 'eventually', 'lead', 'killing', 'spree', 'excellent', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'child', 'growing', 'up', 'killer', 'instead', 'just', 'simple', 'explanation', 'sake', 'exposition', 'Imagine', 'what', 'riskier', 'much', 'more', 'controversial', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'way', 'reawaken', 'franchise', 'was', 'originally', 'hit', 'miss', 'anyhow', 'Regardless', 'once', 'Michael', 'asylum', 'are', 'treated', 'simple', 'slasher', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'killings', 'Were', 'people', 'way', 'first', 'place', 'How', 'know', 'find', 'sister', 'Basically', 'just', 'killing', 'spree', 'sake', 'killing', 'spree', 'several', 'times', 'found', 'yawning', 'losing', 'interest', 'Forget', 'tension', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'get', 'none', 'wanted', 'enjoy', 'film', 'was', 'total', 'let', 'down.Credit', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'having', 'original', 'Misfits', 'Halloween', 'play', 'background']",Halloween
1102654,A4DTOO95QUGQT,B000VKL6Z2,"Randall Brooks ""Author""","[5, 7]","Rob Zombie may as well be in the business of selling vacuum cleaners, for he has given a whole new meaning to the word 'suck'! I've never seen any of Zombie's trash, er, I mean films (if they could be called such), but I have heard from a LOT of people (friends/family/critics/strangers) that ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" was horrendous, a poor man's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", awful, dreadful, NOT scary, etc., etc. I had forgotten (like a LOT of people) that he had made a 2nd 'film', ""The Devil's Rejects"". How he was allowed to even make a 3rd, especially a remake of ""Halloween"" is SO beyond me!! When I 1st saw a trailer for it I thought it was yet another awful sequel, but NO, it's a remake...UGH! This is garbage. Yes, garbage! This is a vile piece of celluloid. It's a useless remake of a film that did NOT need a remake! Zombie took something and revamped it when it was something that didn't need to be touched.Calling it a 'reimagined version' doesn't change the fact that it is still a REMAKE (and ""remake"" is just another name for ""theft""!) , and a totally unnecessary, unneeded, dreadful, awful, atrocious, sacrilige at that.And, for the people posting on here ""Who cares about the original? It was boring and slow, and it took SO long to develop characters, which was a waste of time, cause you're just getting to know characters that are gonna get killed anyways?"", well, you all scare me more than this crap ever could! Where is your moral compass? Your moral center? Your moral core? In other words, your Human side? Just how dehumanized (not to mention how lowbrow) society has become is so frightening. Plus, you all miss the entire point of a horror movie, showing your ignorance to the mechanisms that make a scary movie successful; a rule of thumb that goes all the way back to the silent days of cinema: You MUST get to know the characters so you can feel for them, then therefore be scared when they start getting murdered.It seems as though the mass viewing public doesn't feel the need for 'plot' these days, they just want the latest trend in being 'shocked' instead of being scared, and unfortunately they aren't educated enough to know the difference; or, they have become too dehumanized to even care. Just because Zombie loves horror does not mean he can make a good horror film.What made ""Halloween"" so great: Pacing, and realistic situations, and realistic characters doing realistic things, and VERY creepy atmosphere and music. Plus, it is a very dark psychological film at heart. The way Michael Myers kills off Laurie Strode's friends, making sure she has no one to run to when he goes for her. And, none of them were running around a lake out in a deserted forest in the middle of the night like stupid airhheads screaming ""Here I am Mr. Murderer, come kill me!"" like they were in the senseless ""Friday The 13th"" movies, which were just clones of Carpenter's classic film. No, they were all doing very realistic things suburban teenagers (of that era) do: Smoke a bit of pot, go to school, baby sit, etcRob Zombie has raped/pillaged/stolen/ruined/destroyed everything that was great about this horror masterpiece (yes, masterpiece!) by tinkering around with something that didn't need fixing. He needs to be committed to the 'house of 1,000 corpses' and tortured by 'the devil's rejects' for this sacrilige! Poor Debra Hill is doing flips in her grave, for this is the second John Carpenter/Debra Hill film to be remade counting ""The Fog"". R.I.P. Debra! Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is considered a classic, and ranked among the likes of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" for a reason: It is a solid masterpiece of psychological horror, NOT just another slasher/horror film. It didn't need sequels, and sure as heck didn't need to be remade.IF it had been a frame by frame/shot for shot remake, I might have given it a fairer shake, but to try and give 'history' to Mike Myers, and making his family look like white trash from ""The Jerry Springer Show"", well, he should have called it something else, because it is NOT ""Halloween""! I just don't find it necessary to have a 'backstory' on Michael Myers, well, other than the one that was put into ""Halloween II"", revealing that Laurie Strode was his younger sister. That was the only thing I like about ""Halloween II"", and wished there were some way to edit it into the original film.I would urge anyone that wants to see what all the fuss is about to seek out the John Carpenter/Debra Hill classic, and see the film that has terrified audiences for over 30 years to this day, the last 15 minutes so intense, it could induce heart attacks; and forget this dog turd even exists! I mean, really, who's gonna be talking about Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" in a few years from now??? Except to say ""Avoid it like a rabid dog!"". People won't even remember it long enough to say that in another couple of years. It will fade away and rot like a rotten tomato, so it begs to question: WHY did Zombie waste his time remaking a classic when he could have at least tried to make something original (even though his 'original' films are just as forgettable as well)? This ranks in the same lowbrow category as Gus Van Zant's atrocious remake of ""Psycho"".Sorry, but I'm trying NOT to think about anything in this film anymore. I'm trying REAL hard to forget it even exists, which really isn't that hard to do. Either way, good or bad, I do wish the remake cycle would come to a grinding halt! As for Zombie, well, I don't know what else to say, for I feel like he's a waste of breath (no offense), and his 'remake' is sucking trees out of the ground! AVOID!!

1102655,AZAEN52HOZA7T,B000VKL6Z2,"Reka Kovacs ""Madonna""","[0, 1]","This is a great movie and is scary as hell. It's a remake to John Carpenters classic Halloween which came out in 1978. This movie starts out pretty by exploring more as to what drove Michael in to turning into a psycopatic killer. They basically show us how his relationships with his mother, stepfather, and sister which were not good at all aside from the mother. Michael being bullied at school also did not help.  Michael finally snapps from all of this and goes trick or treating. Malcolm Mcdowell plays Dr. Samual Loomis who tries to help the young Michael who is locked up at Smith Grove for the next 15 years. Then we move to Michael who is now grown up and doesn't talk at all. Loomis finally gives up on him because hes see no hope for helping him at all and moves on and writes a book on Michael. Michael of course escapes. Dr Loomis gets a call that he has escaped.  He knows where he is going to and tries to do anything to help and to stop him because he knows how dangerous he is. After this the second part of the movie beginns which is very similar to Carpentors except more gorier, more death scenes, and too much nudity.  Laurie and her friends are stalked by Michael and we also see Laurie's adoptive parents in this film. The movie moves pretty quickly from here where Michael goes trick or treating again and will kill anybody to get to her baby sister Laurie. It's very suspensful full and action packed so I won't give it away. Some of the bonus materials on the second disv which I found interesting were the deleted scenes, alternate ending, some parts of how the movie was made. Other bonus materials which people would find interesting are the bloopers, and the casting sessions.

1102660,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000VKL6Z2,Richard Ross,"[4, 4]","What a major disappointment this film is coming after the Devil's Rejects. I thought Zombie's directorial debut House of a 1,000 Corpses was too gross and graphic, which is exactly how I feel about this film, whereas the Devil's Rejects was so stylish and well told that you actually cared about the characters. This is just a pointless remake of one of the best horror films of all time. Zombie's intentions with this film were to tell the back story of Michael Myers and offer an explanation for why he was a ruthless psychotic killer. Did we really need an explanation? Isn't it better without? The problem is that the background info is so stereotypical. Mike's mom (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper. Her drunk boyfriend (William Forsythe) is a homophobe who teases Michael mercilessly. His sister thinks he is weird and for good reason since she walks in on him torturing and killing an animal while wearing a weird mask that he made. At school he is the target of bullies who make sexual comments about his mom and then beat him up. The principal does nothing since he doesn't like him either. The only person in his life who doesn't hate him despite his mother is his baby sister who is too young to have an opinion. Come Halloween night his mom is at work, his sister is upstairs having sex, and the boyfriend is passed out on the couch leaving Michael all alone with no one to take him trick or treating. He decides to go into the house, grab a knife and kill everyone save for his baby sister. When mom comes home she finds him calmly sitting on the steps holding the baby. He is arrested and institutionalized where a fame seeking doctor named Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) tries to analyze him and figure out why he did what he did. Michael isn't talking and doesn't for years prompting both Loomis and Michael's mother to give up on him. Fifteen years later Michael stages a violent escape from the institution and goes back to his hometown. Like in the original film we now meet Laurie (Scout Taylor Compton) and her fellow babysitting friends who are discussing their Halloween night plans. The other girls save for Laurie will be with their boyfriends while Laurie will be babysitting the neighbor's kids. By the end of the night Laurie will come face to face with pure evil as Dr. Loomis describes Michael. The doctor will team up with the sheriff (Brad Dourif) to try and stop Michael before he can carry out his mysterious mission. This is the only thing that makes this film different is the back story provided and it finally gives a reason for why Michael is seeking Laurie but those reasons alone don't make it a good film. It is graphically violent like Corpses was and lacks any of the style or wit of Devil's Rejects despite retaining half of that cast. The acting is pretty bad save for McDowell who gives a really good performance which isn't saying much after you see what a ham he is on the gag reel. There are tons of extras on the two disc set but they don't disguise how disappointing and unnecessary this film was.

1102661,ABWHLZFEM5SZY,B000VKL6Z2,R. Jensen,"[0, 0]","FIrst of all, as a remake this movie does have some problems but as just another movie it's pretty darn good. The biggest changes actually didn't bother me as I enjoyed seeing Michael's backstory and actually felt for him in this movie, along with most characters. The overall tone of the movie was a refreshing change from the moderatly dark tones of the previous 5 films. Also a good plus was the violence aspect, and unlike the Friday the 13th movies this film got it right in that, I felt for the characters when they died in gruesome ways.I should mention that in this movie past characters are portrayed differently from their counterparts. Loomis is a lot more action in this movie, Laurie's friends feel like they are less helpless (albeit just as stupid) and Laurie herself was more interesting to watch as this time, you don't know if she'll make it.Now this movie does have a good amount of problems. People of course won't enjoy the characters acting differently, the problem with every movie, in that Michael is never noticed. Finally the biggest issue of, this movie has way to much bad language. Now usually I'm not annoyed by bad language, I'm a big fan of Pulp Fiction and Hell's Kitchen, but in this movie it was off the charts. Most annoying is the Laurie's first scene has her simulating a sexual act. Movie's can have the first showing of the protagonist doing stuff like that, but here it didn't work.

It's very rare that a remake gets it even half-right, and when someone does a remake and attempts to add something, that way lies madness. Except when it works. I know I'm probably in the minority in thinking so--after all, the whole reason Michael Myers is scary in John Carpenter's classic Halloween is that we have absolutely no idea how he got that way, save for one scene at the beginning of the movie that tells us he's already messed up by the time he's ten years old--but I think Rob Zombie giving us Michael Myers' backstory in his Halloween remake actually works.In case you've been underwater for the last thirty years, the plot: a youngster named Michael Myers (played as a youth by Hancock's Daeg Faerch, as an adult by X-Men's Tyler Mane), sick of his abusive family, snaps and offs his stepfather and older sister. When his mother (played by Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon) gets home from her shift at the strip club, Myers is sitting outside the house holding his baby sister. Following this bit, we get half an hour of Myers growing up in the institution, being counselled by Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, about as perfect a replacement for Donald Pleasance as possible). Myers, of course, breaks ourt and heads back to Haddonfield, spending the rest of the film terrorizing Laurie Strode (Wicked Little Things' Scout Taylor-Compton) and her pals.Why does the backstory bit work here? Because Rob Zombie actually thought about it. From the looks of things, he spent years thinking about it. I grant you, it's pretty basic slasher-movie psychology these days--you have to try and make the killer sympathetic by showing that he was abused as a kid or whatever--but the kicker is that Zombie never once attempts to make Michael Myers in any way sympathetic. (You get the feeling for a while he's going to, but he resists the temptation.) It's a subtle subversion of that same slasher-movie psychology Zombie is borrowing wholesale, and it works. In fact, it's kind of brilliant, if you turn your head and squint the right way. Unfortunately, the film falls apart after that, becoming as generic a slasher movie as has come down the pike in some time, but the promise of the first half tells me Rob Zombie may actually be putting it together as a filmmaker. Much better than I expected. ***",3,A pleasant surprise.,1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,2612,"['Halloween', 'Rob', 'Zombie', '2007', 'contempt', 'current', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'craze', 'somehow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'knowing', 'almost', 'remake', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'mess', 'up', 'even', 'when', 'be', 'slavishly', 'faithful', 'think', 'Gus', 'van', 'Sant', 'shot-by-shot', 'Psycho', 'remake', 'here', 'very', 'rare', 'remake', 'even', 'half-right', 'when', 'someone', 'remake', 'attempts', 'add', 'something', 'way', 'madness', 'when', 'know', ""'m"", 'probably', 'minority', 'thinking', 'so', 'whole', 'reason', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'scary', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'classic', 'Halloween', 'have', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'way', 'save', 'one', 'scene', 'beginning', 'movie', 'already', 'messed', 'up', 'time', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'think', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'giving', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'backstory', 'Halloween', 'remake', 'actually', 'works.In', 'case', ""'ve"", 'been', 'underwater', 'last', 'thirty', 'years', 'plot', 'youngster', 'named', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'played', 'youth', 'Hancock', 'Daeg', 'Faerch', 'adult', 'X-Men', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'sick', 'abusive', 'family', 'snaps', 'offs', 'stepfather', 'older', 'sister', 'When', 'mother', 'played', 'Zombie', 'wife', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'home', 'shift', 'strip', 'club', 'Myers', 'sitting', 'house', 'holding', 'baby', 'sister', 'Following', 'bit', 'get', 'hour', 'Myers', 'growing', 'up', 'institution', 'being', 'counselled', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'about', 'perfect', 'replacement', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'possible', 'Myers', 'course', 'breaks', 'ourt', 'heads', 'back', 'Haddonfield', 'spending', 'rest', 'film', 'terrorizing', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'Wicked', 'Little', 'Things', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'pals.Why', 'backstory', 'bit', 'work', 'here', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'actually', 'thought', 'looks', 'things', 'spent', 'years', 'thinking', 'grant', 'pretty', 'basic', 'slasher-movie', 'psychology', 'days', 'have', 'try', 'make', 'killer', 'sympathetic', 'showing', 'was', 'abused', 'kid', 'kicker', 'Zombie', 'never', 'once', 'attempts', 'make', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'way', 'sympathetic', 'get', 'feeling', 'while', 'going', 'temptation', 'subtle', 'subversion', 'same', 'slasher-movie', 'psychology', 'Zombie', 'borrowing', 'wholesale', 'fact', 'kind', 'brilliant', 'turn', 'head', 'squint', 'right', 'way', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'apart', 'becoming', 'generic', 'slasher', 'movie', 'come', 'down', 'pike', 'time', 'promise', 'first', 'half', 'tells', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'putting', 'together', 'filmmaker', 'Much', 'better', 'expected', '***']",Halloween

1102664,A3S175V6UMWDSU,B000VKL6Z2,Robert,"[4, 5]","HALLOWEEN (2007)Rated R / 109 minutesBack in July of 2002, I sat in the local movie theater, stunned at the awfulness known as ""Halloween: Resurrection"". I couldn't fathom how someone could actually make such crap. After the film concluded, I vowed I would never see another ""Halloween"" in the theaters again. Well, fast forward to 2007 and lo and behold, I lied. In this era of filmmaking, the biggest hurtle and the worst flaw for many films is brought on by the very first step of the filmmaking process; the script. While viewing Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's 1978 classic, ""Halloween,"" I can safely say that the film suffers the same fate.It is no exaggeration to say that the film is filled with nothing more than half baked ideas, truly God-awful dialogue (that seriously could have been written by a rambunctious young teen) and one-dimensional characters. This new age ""Halloween"" is just filled with such mean-spirited and foul-mouthed language that it rarely sounds natural. This rings especially true during the sequences of Michael's ""white trash"" upbringing. However, you can hardly blame the poor acting performances (William Forsythe, for one) on anything other than the poor script. You can only work with what you got, and most of which is quite bad.A major structural problem with Zombie's ""Halloween"" is the uneven three-part element to the film. Essentially, the film wants to suggest that Michael is a psychotic killer due to the abuse he's had to withstand and ultimately, Zombie tries to make Myers a sympathetic character. Consistently picked on by bullies and his mother's boyfriend, Michael eventually snaps. From some of the illogical and silly ""kill sequences"" that sets-up Michael's eventual path to the Institution to his over-the-top escape 15 years later, we learn nothing about Michael that couldn't have been stated in all of 3 minutes into the film. Basically, Myers has been reduced to a run-of-the-mill serial killer that is neither interesting nor scary. Though Zombie goes to great lengths to try and make the story resonate as being a disturbing piece of work, it often comes across as either unintentionally comical or painfully contrived. In fact, I must say the idea of the ""mood masks"" is a really bad one, and never works on screen. Tyler Mane (adult Michael Myers) looks absolutely ridiculous in them. And speaking of unintentionally funny moments; the film features the worse misuse of the classic tune ""Love Hurts"" you are ever likely to see. Furthermore, and even more troubling, Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) are no longer the lovable characters they once were. Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif) is wasted and Laurie's teen friends Annie (the near 30-year-old, Danielle Harris) and Lynda (Kristina Klebe) are not only unlikeable, there's no real differences established between the two characters. In fact, nearly every character is underdeveloped and unlikable while every female character is either bitchy or slutty, but mostly both. Quite simply, Zombie's characters lack personality and individuality. They are interchangeable and often times, characters are introduced only to be dropped moments later.After the clich&eacute;d and tired way of Myers gaining his iconic mask to the killing of Joe Grizzley (Ken Foree), the 6'8 mask-wearing maniac roams the streets of Haddonfield nearly undetected. By this point of the film, it was decided to remake ""Halloween"" nearly scene for scene in rapid fire transition. Many flaws pop up during these sequences that simply defy explanation -- for one such example being; continuity. Apparently, Myers is able to be everywhere at once. From scene to scene, he is magically in a different place as if he's the genie from ""Aladdin"". Another major flaw is the fact that Zombie has assumed that everyone has already seen Carpenter's original (and even its sequel). I hope those audience members have or they will be deeply confused why Myers is all of a sudden stalking some teenage girls. It is never known previously that Laurie is his sister. In fact, the earliest part of the film refers to Laurie one time, and that is only by the nickname of ""Boo"".It seems that the main idea was to remake ""Halloween"" into a film with a higher body count, more T & A and more gore with no regards to logic or continuity. The latter could quite possibly be tolerated, however, if the film was able to deliver any scares, suspense or even some creative kills. Instead we are lambasted with shaky-cam effects during some lame, repetitive kill sequences that can not be glossed over just by loud sound effects or by turning up the musical score. The key to making a good horror film both scary and suspenseful, you would first need characters that you can truly care about, and this film doesn't have any. If the idea was to be more of a ""complete film,"" Rob Zombie has certainly failed to deliver as he was unsure to be a prequel or a remake, and thus we are left with incoherent bits and pieces of both.Overall, this ""Halloween"" is an unfocused mess. It's just insulting, deeply flawed (so much so I'd need twice the space to describe them all), and it entirely lacks any semblance of a cohesive unit, not to mention the severe lack of atmosphere and suspense. And while some scenes look sharp, the interaction between characters comes out as being forced and uninspired. Do yourself the favor of steering clear away from this drivel. Now, after all this, I know I can swear off future ""Halloween"" installments forever ... or so I say.",1,Dreadful Remake of a Classic Horror Film,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,5563,"['HALLOWEEN',

1102666,A24DBK597LTN4J,B000VKL6Z2,Robin Solsj Hglund,"[2, 3]","I won't go into a long review about the film, save to say it's not a great one, but I didn't find it extremely horrible either. It's a Rob Zombie movie in all respects (if I want to see Carpenter I'll watch the original, it's as simple as that), but it's never nearly as great as his previous film, The Devil's Rejects. It stays in apathy, just like the main character. A two hour biopic about a psychopath is hardly meant to be about cheers, but neither does this deliver on its scares. It's decent. I'd rate the unrated cut of the film 5 out of 10.This edition is everything you could want out of the film and beyond. If you enjoyed it, or the absolutely excellent R2 DVD for The Devil's Rejects, this is perfect for you. There are all the briefer featurette segments from the previous DVD, which are enjoyable enough (the bloopers don't leave me in stitches, but they're somewhat funny), and there's also every screen test known to man (Rob must love to watch these early and stark readings for whatever reason). As just two discs, it's a somewhat decent special edition, putting into account that the film is unrated with eleven more minutes, and that Rob has a commentary on the entire film and all the deleted scenes. And speaking of those, they're actually pretty good, at least interesting to watch. There are a lot of moments there that the film could've used, but it's too bad there was nothing more with the female trio of the film, perhaps exactly all their scenes were used.Then there's the third disc, with the most exhaustive (length-wise) documentary I've ever seen: ""Michael Lives: The Making of Halloween"". This four and a half hour-long documentary follows the entire pre-production and principal photography process in a rapid fire, day to day event style, including interview segments from Rob and his cast and crew. It shows you everything you could ever want to see about ""how it went down"", but I think it's too bad that there is almost nothing at all on post-production, even if that would've made this mammoth over five hours long. Less Rob wanting to dirty up sets, and more of editing, sound, music, promotion, premiere! Most of the entire thing is also ""coincidental"" camera, we're usually not given any specific context (which is sort of explained in the end credits, with a fun and quick segment of people wanting to continually kill or get rid of the cameraman shooting the documentary). Even if it's more about ""watching when Halloween was made"" than as detailed as Peter Jackson's great ""Recreating the Eighth Wonder: The Making of King Kong"", it's a very good documentary, and it will require more than a casual fan, a completely free afternoon and several cups of coffee or other stimulants to be watched.With Halloween, Rob has done a pretty good job, but has overall delivered a lot more quantity than quality. It is appreciated though, because it's certainly better than the usual five-minute a**kisser segments that pass as special features these days.Oh, and a small plus for the neat slipcase.",4,The Ultimate Edition of a not-so-great movie,1225843200,"11 5, 2008",2008,3035,"['wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'long', 'review', 'film', 'save', 'say', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'extremely', 'horrible', 'either', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'movie', 'respects', 'want', 'see', 'Carpenter', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'original', 'as', 'simple', 'never', 'nearly', 'as', 'great', 'previous', 'film', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'apathy', 'just', 'main', 'character', 'two', 'hour', 'biopic', 'psychopath', 'hardly', 'meant', 'be', 'cheers', 'neither', 'deliver', 'scares', 'decent', ""'d"", 'rate', 'unrated', 'cut', 'film', '5', '10.This', 'edition', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'absolutely', 'excellent', 'R2', 'DVD', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'perfect', 'are', 'briefer', 'featurette', 'segments', 'previous', 'DVD', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'bloopers', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'stitches', ""'re"", 'somewhat', 'funny', 'also', 'screen', 'test', 'known', 'man', 'Rob', 'must', 'love', 'watch', 'early', 'stark', 'readings', 'reason', 'just', 'two', 'discs', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'special', 'edition', 'putting', 'account', 'film', 'unrated', 'eleven', 'more', 'minutes', 'Rob', 'commentary', 'entire', 'film', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'speaking', ""'re"", 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'least', 'interesting', 'watch', 'are', 'lot', 'moments', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'female', 'trio', 'film', 'perhaps', 'exactly', 'scenes', 'were', 'used.Then', 'third', 'disc', 'most', 'exhaustive', 'length-wise', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Michael', 'Making', 'Halloween', 'four', 'half', 'hour-long', 'documentary', 'entire', 'pre-production', 'principal', 'photography', 'process', 'rapid', 'fire', 'day', 'day', 'event', 'style', 'including', 'interview', 'segments', 'Rob', 'cast', 'crew', 'everything', 'could', 'ever', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'went', 'down', 'think', 'too', 'bad', 'almost', 'nothing', 'post-production', 'even', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'mammoth', 'five', 'hours', 'long', 'Less', 'Rob', 'wanting', 'dirty', 'up', 'sets', 'more', 'editing', 'sound', 'music', 'promotion', 'premiere', 'Most', 'entire', 'thing', 'also', 'coincidental', 'camera', ""'re"", 'usually', 'not', 'given', 'specific', 'context', 'sort', 'explained', 'end', 'credits', 'fun', 'quick', 'segment', 'people', 'wanting', 'continually', 'kill', 'get', 'rid', 'cameraman', 'shooting', 'documentary', 'Even', 'more', 'watching', 'when', 'Halloween', 'was', 'made', 'as', 'detailed', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'great', 'Recreating', 'Eighth', 'Wonder', 'Making', 'King', 'Kong', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'will', 'require', 'more', 'casual', 'fan', 'completely', 'free', 'afternoon', 'several', 'cups', 'coffee', 'other', 'stimulants', 'be', 'watched.With', 'Halloween', 'Rob', 'done', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'overall', 'delivered', 'lot', 'more', 'quantity', 'quality', 'appreciated', 'certainly', 'better', 'usual', 'five-minute', 'a**kisser', 'segments', 'pass', 'special', 'features', 'days.Oh', 'small', 'plus', 'neat', 'slipcase']",Halloween

1102668,ADKA2MJQQCMTO,B000VKL6Z2,Ron Sullivan,"[0, 1]","I must have watched this film about three times for no other reason then to decide if I liked it or not.  I was really that on the fence about it.  Final verdict is in and I feel that, although this is admittedly Zombie's best work and there is several kudos to be handed out; ultimately, the film fails.'Halloween' can really be split pretty evenly into two halves.  The first of which is a brand new origin-story for Myers.  Granted, it's a little clich&eacute;d and basically the same white-trash Olympics that Zombie seems to be fixated on.  At the same time though, it's really not bad and I bought into it.  The real standout here is Zombie's real-life wife (Sherri-Moon Zombie) who does a FANTASTIC job of portraying the tragedy of a mother who just can't seem to piece her life back together after Michael snaps.I liked Malcolm McDowell here quite a bit as well.  I've read some pretty heavy criticism of the way he approached the 'Loomis' character, however, I like his approach a little better then (God forgive me for saying this) Donald Pleasance's take.  I always saw Pleasance's 'Loomis' as just some nut that shows up screaming ""He's evil!"" while shooting a couple of rounds in the air.The real problem is, it's the very existence of this back-story that ultimately betrays the original concept of Myers in the first place.  In the original, and in most of John Carpenter's early films, Carpenter seemed to have a general understanding that nothing was scarier then the fear of the unknown.  In the original 'Halloween' Myers was an unseen terror lurking in the shadows, stalking his victims and biding his time until he decided to strike.  He didn't show even a HINT of emotion or humanity.  Until the audience caught a glimpse of him with his mask off, most people probably weren't even sure he was human.  We didn't know WHAT the motivation was for his rampage.  It was as if ""death itself descended on Haddonfield.""By explaining too much, in my opinion, Zombie ultimately betrays that concept and demystified what made Michael Myers so cool in the first place.  If you'd made the first half about ANYONE other then the Michael Myers character, it would have worked and been a hundred times better.I thought the second-half of the movie stumbled pretty badly.  While Zombie brought a lot of new material and ideas to the first-half, the second is a flat-out remake of the entire first movie.  At this point, in my opinion, you just can't completely remake a film that's an hour and a half in forty minutes.  It just doesn't work.  You don't have enough time to properly build any momentum, there's no atmosphere created, and absolutely no character development.  Zombie had possibly the best character actor in Hollywood in Brad Douriff and he's almost completely wasted as the film screams along at the pace of a runaway truck.  What was originally a world-class thriller is warped into an action movie, and like the first part, it just doesn't work.If Zombie wanted to do an origin that was completely new, he should have stuck with it.  On the other hand, if he wanted to do a shot-by-shot remake in the vein of Psycho, he should have stuck with THAT concept.  What you absolutely CAN'T do is both, which is exactly what we have here.While I'm willing to admit that it was a good swing; regrettably in the end, it just doesn't work.",2,Good effort ... but falls short,1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,3353,"['must', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'three', 'times', 'other', 'reason', 'then', 'decide', 'liked', 'not', 'was', 'really', 'fence', 'Final', 'verdict', 'feel', 'admittedly', 'Zombie', 'best', 'work', 'several', 'kudos', 'be', 'handed', 'out', 'ultimately', 'film', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'split', 'pretty', 'evenly', 'two', 'halves', 'first', 'brand', 'new', 'origin-story', 'Myers', 'Granted', 'little', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'basically', 'same', 'white-trash', 'Olympics', 'Zombie', 'be', 'fixated', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'bought', 'real', 'standout', 'here', 'Zombie', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Sherri-Moon', 'Zombie', 'who', 'FANTASTIC', 'job', 'portraying', 'tragedy', 'mother', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'piece', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'Michael', 'snaps.I', 'liked', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'here', 'quite', 'bit', 'as', 'well', ""'ve"", 'read', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'criticism', 'way', 'approached', ""'Loomis"", 'character', 'however', 'approach', 'little', 'better', 'then', 'God', 'forgive', 'saying', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'take', 'always', 'saw', 'Pleasance', ""'Loomis"", 'just', 'nut', 'up', 'screaming', 'evil', 'shooting', 'couple', 'rounds', 'air.The', 'real', 'problem', 'very', 'existence', 'back-story', 'ultimately', 'original', 'concept', 'Myers', 'first', 'place', 'original', 'most', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'early', 'films', 'Carpenter', 'seemed', 'have', 'general', 'understanding', 'nothing', 'was', 'scarier', 'then', 'fear', 'unknown', 'original', ""'Halloween"", 'Myers', 'was', 'unseen', 'terror', 'lurking', 'shadows', 'stalking', 'victims', 'biding', 'time', 'decided', 'strike', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'even', 'HINT', 'emotion', 'humanity', 'audience', 'caught', 'glimpse', 'mask', 'off', 'most', 'people', 'probably', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'sure', 'was', 'human', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'WHAT', 'motivation', 'was', 'rampage', 'was', 'death', 'descended', 'Haddonfield', 'explaining', 'too', 'much', 'opinion', 'Zombie', 'ultimately', 'concept', 'demystified', 'what', 'made', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'so', 'cool', 'first', 'place', ""'d"", 'made', 'first', 'half', 'ANYONE', 'other', 'then', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'been', 'hundred', 'times', 'better.I', 'thought', 'second-half', 'movie', 'stumbled', 'pretty', 'badly', 'Zombie', 'brought', 'lot', 'new', 'material', 'ideas', 'first-half', 'second', 'flat-out', 'remake', 'entire', 'first', 'movie', 'point', 'opinion', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'completely', 'remake', 'film', 'hour', 'half', 'forty', 'minutes', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'properly', 'build', 'momentum', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'absolutely', 'character', 'development', 'Zombie', 'had', 'possibly', 'best', 'character', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'Brad', 'Douriff', 'almost', 'completely', 'wasted', 'film', 'screams', 'along', 'pace', 'runaway', 'truck', 'What', 'was', 'originally', 'world-class', 'thriller', 'warped', 'action', 'movie', 'first', 'part', 'just', ""n't"", 'work.If', 'Zombie', 'wanted', 'do', 'origin', 'was', 'completely', 'new', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'other', 'hand', 'wanted', 'do', 'shot-by-shot', 'remake', 'vein', 'Psycho', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'concept', 'What', 'absolutely', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'do', 'exactly', 'what', 'have', 'here.While', ""'m"", 'willing', 'admit', 'was', 'good', 'swing', 'regrettably', 'end', 'just', ""n't"", 'work']",Halloween

1102674,A1HJZ1SBR0ROHH,B000VKL6Z2,"Shayne ""- Shayne""","[6, 7]","I liked it. I really did. I enjoyed it as a film. As an individual film, seperate from the rest. Sure, it wasn't perfect. It felt a little uneven in the middle. In other words, it seemed like each half of the film were really just shortened individual films that were put together to make a whole new one. Because of that, the remake phase was a tiny bit fast-paced for me. However, overall, I enjoyed it a great deal. There is a reason why, however, that is deeper than the film itself.What Rob presented was a great film, that had a story that wasn't perfect. Therein lies the genius of it. It felt real. It didn't feel like a movie. While many will find that to make it a cluttered mess, it didn't for me. An example would be the way he presented Michael's victims. We didn't get to know them that well before he killed them. But when some serial killer kills a group of people, and it is announced on the news, what do you think the chances are that you know those people? You don't. And yet, it is still horrifying. In other words, you don't have to know the victims to understand how terrifying the crime is.In a movie, you follow these people around, the camera being your eye as you stalk them invisibly. You really get to know the people. Here, by not following them, it presents that realism quite well. You don't know who these people are, but whether you know them or not, Michael Myers is still presented as a terrifying being. Speaking of ol' Mikey...I thought Tyler and Daeg's performances were amazing. I loved how even though you could sympathize with him in his early life, it didn't change how bizzare, and truly evil he was. Right in the opening scenes, we see him petting a rat, and then we see moments later cleaning a bloody scalpel or something. Then, he tells his mother that his rat died. You know what he did. It's not that hard to figure out. What's great about this is that it shows that even though he had this terrible life, he didn't just snap over night. He's been going crazy for some time. The scene with the bully in the woods was powerful, at least for me. His eventual escape was equally amazing. How he took out those guards truly showed his power, and menace. I especially liked when he killed Ismael Cruz, because that was the indicator that the young boy that went into Smiths Grove was not the monster that walked out. To quote the original Doctor Loomis, ""That part of him died years ago."" Michael Myers in this film, as a character, was just as scary as he was in the original. The best Myers since Castle IMO.Which brings me to another point that I really liked. I think that of all the actors who could have played Loomis, Rob really picked the right one, which was surely a difficult task. Sure, many suggested Anthony Hopkins, but (and I hate to say this) having played similar characters several times, he may have had a spirited performance, but he would have taken you out of the real world, and remind you that it was only a movie. Rob could have cast an actor that wasn't that well known, but then the performance would have been lacking, and have the same effect. With someone like McDowell, he has that face that is just obscure enough that you can buy him as a real person, yet he is also a great enough actor that he can still pull an amazing performance.The rest of the cast was great as well. I really liked Harris as Annie, and Laurie was cast pretty well in my opinion. She acted like a real teenage girl. I would know, there's one next door, and then there's my younger sister. As for greeting each other with ""Hey, Bitches"" I think that was actually rather spot on. Real girls aren't like cartoon girls, or 7th Heaven characters, who go wide-eyed the moment someone uses a curse word.Like I said, the film isn't perfect, but it was definately better than most, if not all of the sequels. As for how it measures up against the original, well, in terms of sheer quality, no, it wasn't better. But better isn't what they set out to do in the first place. I think this is the problem with most remakes. Many people who bash them believe that the initial concept is to make a better version. What Rob set out to do was make a Halloween that was just as good as the original, to make Michael Myers scary again, and at that he passed in flying colors. Sure, the original had good things that this film didn't have, but this film had good things that the original didn't have. They're different films, so you can't really judge them together. It's not a shot-for-shot remake, and it isn't a rehash either, so there's not much room to really compare everything. The only area where you can compare them is in the level of quality, and at that, they're at about the same level for me.Will this film have a legacy like the original? No, probably not. The original Halloween made a legacy because it was a fresh concept, and the first true slasher. Yes, it could be said that the original Black Christmas is the father of Halloween (funny, huh?), but Halloween is the father of slasher films. Without it, there would be no Friday the 13th, no Prowler, no Nightmare on Elm Street, no Cropsy (The Burning), none of these characters and franchises would have been brought to life without the original Halloween. Now that the slasher genre has grown so much, this new Halloween can't really do the same thing that the original did. However, as is evident in the upcoming Friday the 13th, it does seem as though it may inspire one new trend: remakes that actually try hard to be good movies, rather than cash-ins.",4,Give it a chance

1102677,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000VKL6Z2,Sid the Elf,"[3, 4]","This week we, Sid the Elf, decided to review the remake or whatever of the greatest horror film ever, Halloween. Now, we knew that this film was done by the ever-creepy Rob Zombie so we realized going in that things had a chance to get wierd or stupid but this one was ridiculous. It was a remake of the classic, kind of but not really. And the parts that were the same as the original were different here. Sounds confusing? Well how about watching this in an altered state trying to figure it out?The bulk of the film concentrated on Michael Myers's early life and his rise to the top of the world of serial killing. The funniest parts of this movie came in the section where the evil stepdad was making fun of a young Myers calling him a freak and questioning his sexuality while Myers stands there taking it while wearing a homemade mask. It doesn't get much funnier than that. You also had young Myers making the ""I want to wrestle you so freaking bad"" face whenever anyone made him mad. Well, when he wasn't wearing one of his little masks. That was great. Also, young Myers offered us a couple of freakouts. The one when he went off on Loomis was awesome. If this movie was not a remake of a classic, and stood on its own, it would have made a pretty good horror B as all the elements were there. However, when you look at this film as the remake that it was, it fell way short.First, Sid would like to talk to you about Loomis. In the original, he was the best part about the film. Who could forget such classic lines as, ""Tell your men to keep their eyes open and their mouths closed,"" along with many others. In the remake Loomis offered nothing, he had the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes. He even exploited Myers's psycosis by writing a book and going on a speaking tour over it. Then, there was Laurie. In the first film, she was sweet and innocent and you really did not want Myers to catch her. This was one of the things that made the original. In the new version, she was trashy and annoying. Sid was hoping they would change the ending and have Myers strangle her by the 30 minute mark. Finally, there was Myers. In this one, he was a giant goon, which does explain his freakish strength and adds a lot in the way of unintentional comedy. But, he was so goofy. Sid even joked that Kane was playing him, only to find out that it was actually a more b wrestler that we'd never even heard of! Big Sky is the guy's name for the record.So, this film was ok at best. That's factoring in all the unintentional comedy by goofy Myers, young Myers, and the stepdad; and the um, comedic mood Sid was in. Apperances by Clint Howard and Danny Trejo helped ease the pain a little. Oh, and the few times the film featured ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" was a pretty cool nod to the original and to more cowbell. But, Zombie's version concentrated too much on the gore of Myers' killings and his disturbed past really trying to drive home the fact that this man is totally insane. Yeah, we kind of got that by the huge killing spree, but I guess when you're Rob Zombie that's not really enough to classify someone as off the reservation. This one is probably only worth checking out if you've never seen the original and want to settle in with a decent horror B or if you just want to make fun of fat young Myers for a little bit. All in all 3 stars, not great, not bad.

1102678,AAY15GAYCKQGU,B000VKL6Z2,Simonsson Bengt Anders,"[2, 2]","I thought Rob's take on Halloween and Michael Myers was excellent. The first half of the film was the most interesting part, as it describes Michaels background, his hellish family, and what eventually triggered his killing spree. It doesn't explain *why* he did it and it doesn't treat him with any particular symphaty. It's just a cold and raw description of his upbringing, much more realistic and gruesome than anything from Carpenter's original film. Michael ends up in a cell, he breaks out, and after that, it's unfortunately pretty much business as usual for a Halloween film.I say unfortunately, because the film works best when Rob follows his own vision and I thought it was annoying when he tried to keep the Halloween traditionalists happy by including the Captain Kirk mask, the jump suit, the corny ""sheet over the head"" gag, etc. The first half of the film is so realistic that these pointless silly details ruin the overall impression and atmosphere. There's no real reason for Michael to put on the Captain Kirk mask or the jump suit, other than that the fans demands it. Michael does his own masks, as shown by the chilling scene from his cell, where the walls are covered with them. And Michael would *never* waste time by putting a sheet over his head, when there's killing to be done.These leftovers from the original film should have been canned, even if it would have made the fans angry, because let's face it, the hardcore fans were *always* going to hate this, no matter how good it was.",4,"Remake, not repetition",1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,1514,"['thought', 'Rob', 'take', 'Halloween', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'was', 'excellent', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'Michaels', 'background', 'hellish', 'family', 'what', 'eventually', 'triggered', 'killing', 'spree', ""n't"", 'explain', 'did', ""n't"", 'treat', 'particular', 'symphaty', 'just', 'cold', 'raw', 'description', 'upbringing', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'gruesome', 'anything', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'film', 'Michael', 'up', 'cell', 'out', 'unfortunately', 'pretty', 'much', 'business', 'usual', 'Halloween', 'film.I', 'say', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'Rob', 'own', 'vision', 'thought', 'was', 'annoying', 'when', 'tried', 'keep', 'Halloween', 'traditionalists', 'happy', 'including', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'mask', 'jump', 'suit', 'corny', 'sheet', 'head', 'gag', 'etc', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'so', 'realistic', 'pointless', 'silly', 'details', 'ruin', 'overall', 'impression', 'atmosphere', 'real', 'reason', 'Michael', 'put', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'mask', 'jump', 'suit', 'other', 'fans', 'Michael', 'own', 'masks', 'shown', 'chilling', 'scene', 'cell', 'where', 'walls', 'are', 'covered', 'Michael', 'would', '*never*', 'waste', 'time', 'putting', 'sheet', 'head', 'when', 'killing', 'be', 'done.These', 'leftovers', 'original', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'canned', 'even', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'fans', 'angry', 'let', 'face', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'were', '*always*', 'going', 'hate', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'was']",Halloween

I thought it was silly to remake such an iconic film. and a film in which the series is still carrying on. But, I saw it in theatres the day it came out and LOVED it. It was great in it's own way.

And to me that's a good thing; Zombie attempts to re-invent the Michael Myers character in his version versus basically doing over what was already done masterfully with the original.So what I suggest that you do is go into this movie with the above understanding. Because if you're a preservationist that doesn't want his classics messed with, then Zombie's adaptation will probably leave you angry and unsatisfied. I, on the other hand, was quite entertained by Zombie's Halloween. After all, a simple re-do that adds nothing new to what was already solidly in place would be pointless, right?Yes...I said ""re-do"" as opposed to ""re-make"". A re-make is when a director takes an old film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it different, and ideally, *better*. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original. Zombie may not have made a *better* movie than the original, but he sure did give the movie a unique spin.The first half of the movie is devoted to telling the Michael Myers story. The movie starts by showing Myers' at age 10 or 11. It's during this time that Zombie chronicles how Myers went from troubled to tormented to demented to completely psychopathic. The movie flash forwards 15 years through Myers incarceration and ultimate escape to wreak havoc on the infamous town of Haddonfield just like in the original.The first half of the movie is very well done to the point I was saying to myself that ""this is a great movie."" But then in the second half it collapses a bit with too many clich&eacute; horror movie ""oh that would never really happen"" moments. You know, like the police don't believe there's any danger and they're stupid; people venturing into places that you know they'd never go...especially on the heels of the warning that Myers could be in town; and the whole point of the first half of the movie seemed to attempt to show that Myers was human and just a psychopath, but that starts to go out the window in the second half as Myers starts showing a few immortal traits.But, like I said, I was entertained. The cast is pretty good, and the kid that played Myers at age 10 was outstanding. This re-make is definitely worth a watch for horror fans, but devoted fans of the original might want to take a pass.",3,The Michael Myers Story,1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,2404,"[""'re"", 'looking', 're-do', 'John', 'Carpenter', '1978', 'classic', 'version', 'ofHalloween', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 're-make', 'good', 'thing', 'Zombie', 're-invent', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'character', 'version', 'versus', 'basically', 'doing', 'over', 'what', 'was', 'already', 'done', 'masterfully', 'original.So', 'what', 'suggest', 'do', 'go', 'movie', 'above', 'understanding', ""'re"", 'preservationist', ""n't"", 'want', 'classics', 'messed', 'then', 'Zombie', 'adaptation', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'angry', 'unsatisfied', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'quite', 'entertained', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'simple', 're-do', 'nothing', 'new', 'what', 'was', 'already', 'solidly', 'place', 'would', 'be', 'pointless', 'right', 'Yes', 'said', 're-do', 'opposed', 're-make', 're-make', 'when', 'director', 'old', 'film', 'sometimes', 'even', 'classic', 'different', 'ideally', '*better*', 're-do', 'when', 'director', 'film', 'nothing', 'original', 'Zombie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'made', '*better*', 'movie', 'original', 'sure', 'did', 'give', 'movie', 'unique', 'spin.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'devoted', 'telling', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'story', 'movie', 'showing', 'Myers', 'age', '10', '11', 'time', 'Zombie', 'how', 'Myers', 'went', 'troubled', 'tormented', 'demented', 'completely', 'psychopathic', 'movie', 'flash', 'forwards', '15', 'years', 'Myers', 'incarceration', 'ultimate', 'escape', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'infamous', 'town', 'Haddonfield', 'just', 'original.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'point', 'was', 'saying', 'myself', 'great', 'movie', 'then', 'second', 'half', 'bit', 'too', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'horror', 'movie', 'would', 'never', 'really', 'happen', 'moments', 'know', 'police', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'danger', ""'re"", 'stupid', 'people', 'venturing', 'places', 'know', ""'d"", 'never', 'go', 'especially', 'heels', 'warning', 'Myers', 'could', 'be', 'town', 'whole', 'point', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'seemed', 'attempt', 'show', 'Myers', 'was', 'human', 'just', 'psychopath', 'go', 'out', 'window', 'second', 'half', 'Myers', 'showing', 'few', 'immortal', 'traits.But', 'said', 'was', 'entertained', 'cast', 'pretty', 'good', 'kid', 'played', 'Myers', 'age', '10', 'was', 'outstanding', 're-make', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', 'horror', 'fans', 'devoted', 'fans', 'original', 'might', 'want', 'take', 'pass']",Halloween

1102683,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000VKL6Z2,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[0, 5]","When you're doing a remake of a movie that was done right the first time, you have to differentiate it, take the same premise and go down some different paths than the first one took.  The 2007 Halloween remake does this, and it helps make it one of the best horror remakes ever done.The most obvious deviation from the original line of films is that Michael Myers now has an origin.  A large part of what made the original work was the very lack of a reason behind the character's malevolence: Michael was a perfectly normal little kid who, for no discernible reason, picks up a kitchen knife one October 31 and butchers his sister, beginning a years-long cycle as a mute, endlessly killing, boogeyman.  This time there's nothing normal about Michael to begin with.  He was born with psychotic tendencies and then grew up in an envirornment of abuse and torment; either of these factors - the nature or the nurture - could have resulted in a murderer, but coming together they create what Sam Loomis (played by Malcolm McDowell in the role Donald Pleasance originally made famous) calls a 'perfect storm', that creates the monsterous killing machine Myers becomes.  It was a big risk to change the core of the character from an eerily blank slate to the more human monster we have in this version, but it worked great, and Myers (played by Tyler Mane as an adult and Daeg Faerch as a ten year-old) is menacing enough to leave just that little glimmer that Maybe there's even more at play behind that white mask than the aforementioned factors.The other big change is the time frame.  The 1978 original opens with Myers as a child but that takes up only a few minutes - 95% of the movie occurs on the Halloween day and night fifteen years later when Michael returns to his hometown of Haddonfield.  Here, the movie starts some time before the night Michael becomes a killer and continues through the years that follow, including his incarceration at a mental hospital and his eventual, devastating escape and return to Haddonfield.  We see the evolution of the monster in full, and by the time he's back home on Halloween night Myers is a tremendous, truly frightening force.Everything from the acting to the direction and the special effects, musical score, etc. is extremely high caliber and in addition to being scary and, at times, surprisingly moving, it's also one of the sexiest horror movies out there thanks to a cast of great looking actresses including Danielle Harris, Scout Taylor-Compton, Kristina Klebe, Hanna Hall and Sheri Moon Zombie.  Also of interest on the acting front are appearances by Bill Mosely and Danny Trejo (both from director Rob Zombie's Firefly films - ""The House Of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"") and Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky from the ""Child's Play"" movies).  Effective use of music and a number of hugely memorable visual images are also worth noting.The 2007 Halloween doesn't take the place of the original series, nor does it set out to; it extablishes itself as a great, Different take on the original concept and characters, and manages to match anything from the original series.

1102689,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000VKL6Z2,Taheen Lopez,"[4, 7]","This 2007 remake flick of HALLOWEEN by Rob Zombie wasn't that good and seemed like a bit of a waste and a rip off even though it had a lot more action, violence, and blood than the original John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece film of HALLOWEEN, plus it wasn't nearly as heart-pounding either, so this was a poor imitation and poor remake and/or resurrection and revision of HALLOWEEN and I don't recommend it anyone, because even though Zombie's HALLOWEEN flick included a human side of Michael Myers and how he became so deranged and psychotic from being bullied at school and coming from trashy family household, Zombie's 2007 HALLOWEEN film lacks style and goes too far with Michaels human side and childhood days, unlike John Carpenter's 1978 HALLOWEEN masterpiece.For instance, Michael Myers didn't make the heavy breathing sounds like he made in John Carpenters 1978 version of HALLOWEEN and like Michael Myers did in Halloween II as well.You also wouldn't see Michael Myers one second and then vanishing the next like you did in the original either and Michael Myers wasn't as sneaky either, but it's almost as if they tried to overcompensate by making Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN flick a lot gorier with a lot more nudity and cussing instead by making the sex, nudity and bloody scenes overkill in comparison to the original, plus Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN left no cliffhanger ending at the end of this HALLOWEEN flick either, unlike John Carpenters 1978 HALLOWEEN flick.In addition to what sucked about this HALLOWEEN flick by Rob Zombie, Lynda(Kristina Klebe) was very rude, snotty, and annoying, but Lynda(P.J. Soles) in the original 1978 version of Halloween wasn't nearly as rude, obnoxious, or as annoying at all, which made the Lynda character in this 2007 version of Halloween a very annoying character, plus Dr. Loomis(Malcolm McDowell) dies off from Michael Myers in this HALLOWEEN flick, but Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasance) survives in the original by John Carpenter along with all the other HALLOWEEN installments.Additionally, in John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN flick, Lynda(P.J. Soles) was having a good time humping around with her boyfriend(Bob)at a babysitters houses in someone else's bed, but in this Zombie HALLOWEEN flick, Lynda(Kristina Klebe) and her boyfriend(Bob) sneak into the vacant dumpy Myers house to do hubba hubba with some blankets on the floor instead, except Lynda doesn't end up having a good time with her boyfriend and not enjoying the sex with Bob at all and ends up putting Bob down instead of praising him or appreciating him and showing us a lot more nudity on Lynda instead of having Lynda and Bob enjoying the intimacy, unlike how it went for Lynda and her boyfriend in the original, since Lynda complimented her boyfriend in the 1978 version after Lynda and Bob have their orgasm by Lynda saying ""Oh Fantastic"" after Bob finishes boning Lynda, since Lynda and Bob obviously enjoyed the lovemaking in the original, especially before they got killed by Michael Myers not to mention that the characters who have premarital sex in these kind of terror flicks always seem to die off, but the survivors always seem to be virgins like Laurie for instance.In addition to what helped screw this HALLOWEEN remake up by Rob Zombie was in the original 1978 flick of HALOWEEN by John Carpenter; Michael Myers killed his older sister(Judith Myers) at age 6 and then escapes from the institution 15 years later at age 21 to return to his hometown(Haddonfield, Illinois) to kill his kid sister(Laurie Strode), but in Zombie's 2007 remake; Michael kills his big sister(Hannah Hall), his stepfather(Bill Forsythe), and sisters boyfriend at age 10 instead of 6 and returns to Haddonfield to kill less than 15 years later.This HALLOWEEN version also didn't even show the credits to the cast, crew, and credits at the beginning of this flick either, unlike the original HALLOWEEN done by John Carpenter.Something else I noticed about this movie is in the scene just before Lynda(Kristina Klebe) dies off was for some reason they had censored out Kristina Klebe's coochie in this DVD, but in the movies they had actually shown Kristina Klebe's whole Womanhood with the 3B's Breast, Bush, Butt when Kristina Klebe(Lynda)was shown in full frontal nudity just before being killed off by Michael Myers.All the actors and characters in this movie also acted very amateurish with abnormal potty mouths and bad attitudes, plus I didn't even care or sympathize for the characters Laurie(Scout Taylor-Compton), Lynda(Kris Klebe), or Annie(Danielle Harris) in this movie either since they all seemed hardly likeable and a lot more immature and airheaded than Laurie(Jamie-Lee Curtis), Lynda(PJ Soles), and Annie(Nancy Loomis)were in the original HALLOWEEN by John Carpenter, which I had liked and sympathized for in that version, unlike Zombie's version.Therefore I had zero sympathy for Judith Myers and Judiths boyfriend when Michael killed them after Judiths boyfriend finishes seducing her since Judith was rude and slutty looking in this HALLOWEEN version especially after Judith flaked out on taking Michael trick-or-treating to go upstairs to have sex in her bedroom instead which would make me almost fired up enough to want to do something like that who bowed out on me just so they could get laid.In addition to why I had zero sympathy for all the victims who died off in this HALLOWEEN flick; Michael Myers came from a dysfunctional trashy family household with no manners like the Bundys on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN, but in the original HALLOWEEN flick by John Carpenter from 1978, Michael came from a clean, sweet, honest, & typical family household like on LEAVE IT TO BEAVER which is why I sympathized for Judith Myers & most of Michaels other victims in the original HALLOWEEN since Michael was a lot less prompted by his victims to kill as opposed to this version.So I agree with anybody who disapproves of this 2007 horror film and I agree with anyone who thinks Zombie did a terrible job with this revision of HALLOWEEN along with the fact that I expected Zombie's HALLOWEEN flick to be much better, but it wasn't even close to being as great as I had expected and I agree with anyone who felt the same way about Zombie's version of HALLOWEEN as opposed to John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece of HALLOWEEN.So you could say Scout Taylor-Compton, Kristina Klebe, and Danielle Harris all tarnished the characters of Laurie, Annie, and Lynda.So save your money and don't buy this DVD, but if you choose to watch it, just rent the movie or borrow it from a friend and it's almost as if this terror flick was overrated too.Therefore, this HALLOWEEN by Rob Zombie bites the big one and the HALLOWEEN flick by John Carpenter is still the very best to this very day and always will be.Therefore, this flick would've been better off if it had been titled something like HALLOWEEN 9: THE BEGINNING just like they did with the PSYCHO saga installments with PSYCHO 4:THE BEGINNING which tells us more about the story and untold story on Norman Bates and how he was before he went haywire and killed his own mother and customers who'd stay at the Bates Motel, which was similar to what Zombie did in this version, but since Zombie had revised Carpenter's version of HALLOWEEN and it wasn't as good or as authentic, this HALLOWEEN flick faltered instead making it even better than the original, but I think this flick would've been a little more successful if this movie would've been made as HALLOWEEN 9: THE BEGINING or something like that, since the purpose of Zombie's Halloween flick was to show and explain the untold story about Michael Myers and how he became the way he did and that Michael Myers actually had a human side to him that actually even talked, just like there was more to Norman Bates than we all knew that was revealed in PSYCHO IV:THE BEGINNING.So for anyone who can prefer Zombie's version to Carpenter's version is way beyond me and is quite baffling and I agree with anybody who says Zombie's HALLOWEEN flick is a rip off, a waste of time, or insult to the original.By the way, I just got word that Rob Zombie will be having his sequel to this movie released this Summer and that H2 will be released on Friday August 28th in theatres everywhere, but from the previews I've seen on its theatrical trailer online, H2 looks pretty cheesy and will probably be even cheesier than Zombie's HALLOWEEN 1 flick and will probably bite at the box office.",2,TWO THUMBS WAY DOWN!,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,8473,"['2007', 'remake', 'flick', 'HALLOWEEN', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'was',

1102693,A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ,B000VKL6Z2,the-gr8shag,"[12, 23]","As a die-hard fan of Carpenter's classic, I was incredibly dissapointed & angry at this lame, trashy remake.The problem with this ""Halloween"" is:1. Zombie needs to stop, & I mean stop, casting his films with entire casts from his previous films. The entire cast from ""Devil's Rejects"" is here & it was really annoying. He also needs to bring his films into the present. Enough with the white trash 70's.2. The film spends way, way too much time in Michael's youth. He kills his sister - we know this going into the picture, since we're versed in Carpenter's original. This makes the movie sag like William Forsythe's stomach. Putting a human face on Michael Myers was also a big mistake.In the original, the grown up Michael was known as ""The Shape"", for the simple reason being, is that behind that mask was the simple definition of pure evil incarnate. In Zombie's remake, basically, Myers turns out to be just another a-hole gone psychotic from a byproduct of white trash American society. Get him a job at the local post office & he would fit right in.3. The timeline in this film is totally f***ed. I can only assume that the beginning of this film starts on Halloween of 1978, since little Mikey is listening to ""God Of Thunder"", has a Kiss t-shirt on, & the entire atmosphere looks like, at least, poor whitetrash mid-seventies. So add 15 years to 1978 add at least 2 or 3 more for good measure & you still come up to 1995, 96 at best. Thats all well & good until Lynda tries to make a call on her cell phone, topless, in the Myers house.4. Tyler Mane as Michael Myers. I really had no problem with this until he first shows up in his cell in a bathrobe & slippers. Its gets worse as he turns around with an orange mask on his face that reminded me of the WWE's Kane. I was waiting for the Undertaker to show up for god's sake! ""Rest in Peace""? You bet.5. Michael actually catches Laurie - & doesn't kill her. What!?!? That's like Wyle E. Coyote catching The Road Runner, turning to the audience, & saying, ""What do I do now?""6. The score. Not here it isn't. Carpenter's haunting opening theme is used in Zombie's film 4 times at best & at all the wrong times. Zombie uses old school 70's tunes during different scenes. Not bad, but this is ""Halloween"" not ""High School Musical"".7. Its not scary. It's almost like watching an epiosde of A&E;'s ""Cold Case File"" or ""American Justice"". Zombie doesn't really set any tone or atmosphere for the film. Its just one set piece after another.8. The ending.

1102694,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,B000VKL6Z2,the masked reviewer,"[24, 34]","""Reimagining,"" and ""reinventing"" are popular words these days. But the truth is, there seems to be a creative bankruptcy that has plagued Hollywood for the past ten years or so. Plenty of foolish horror remakes have come down the line recently (The Hitcher, When a Stranger Calls, The Fog, The Omen), but few of those even hold a candle to Rob Zombie's desecration of John Carpenter's 1978 classic, HALLOWEEN.Made for literally next to nothing, and with a no-name cast (at the time), Carpenter's original HALLOWEEN created genuine suspense and terror through masterful direction. The atmosphere was thick, the compositions perfect, and the haunting soundtrack was right on the money. Carpenter's vision contained next to no blood and a very small body count. What makes the original HALLOWEEN so deliciously frightening is the anticipation of violence.Most know the nuts and bolts of the tale. On Halloween night, a 6-year-old Michael Myers kills his sister (after she has sex with her boyfriend) and is sent to a mental institution. Fifteen years later he escapes and returns to his stomping grounds for another round of terror.Writer/Director Rob Zombie establishes from the outset that his version needs more exposition than the original, and this is a stupendous error. This clich&eacute;-ridden back story to serial killer Michael Myers is pathetic. Little Michael kills animals, gets picked on at school, and has a morbid fascination with masks. Dr. Samuel Loomis does his best to try and rehab the young boy, but it's to no avail. Michael is pure evil, but we know that going in. That Zombie populates the entire first half of the film with this nonsense is inexplicable.The excessive first few reels make the second half a frustrating bore. Once Michael escapes from the hospital the film basically turns into a retread of the original, though it contains NO suspense, just a whole lot of spurting blood. Once the killing really begins the entire first half is canceled out almost immediately; we feel nothing. Worst of all, the hero of the original, Laurie Strode, is reduced to a supporting player. Since we don't even get to know her until the hour mark, how much can we care about her? (It must also be said that making Laurie Strode Michael's sister was never Carpenter's original intention. Michael was supposed to be pure evil  on a killing spree. Box office profits and a contractual sequel forced Carpenter to come up with that particular tie-in for part two and he has often said he never liked it. If one watches the original 1978 film, no mention of Laurie's relationship to Michael Meyers is even hinted at.)With it's overlong prelude about Meyers childhood, what Zombie has ultimately done is turn Michael into the film's hero. The rest of the characters are so despicable that it's impossible to root for them (except for Danny Trejo as a janitor who befriends Michael in the institution). Zombie's trailer trash humor and all-around filth adds nothing and only serve to elicit a smirk or tiny sense of disgust in the viewer.The sad fact is that this is an incompetent film no matter how you examine it. Just one more brand name rip-off in the name of a quick buck - and the complete debasement of a groundbreaking original. John Carpenter can rest easy. This version will never replace the amazing (and still very scary) 1978 masterpiece.",1,EVIL is THE HERO in Zombie's pointless remake of John Carpenter's classic original.,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,3362,"['Reimagining', 'reinventing', 'are', 'popular', 'words', 'days', 'truth', 'be', 'creative', 'bankruptcy', 'plagued', 'Hollywood', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'so', 'Plenty', 'foolish', 'horror', 'remakes', 'have', 'come', 'down', 'line', 'recently', 'Hitcher', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'Fog', 'Omen', 'few', 'even', 'hold', 'candle', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'desecration', 'John', 'Carpenter', '1978', 'classic', 'HALLOWEEN.Made', 'literally', 'next', 'nothing', 'no-name', 'cast', 'time', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'HALLOWEEN', 'created', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'terror', 'masterful', 'direction', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'thick', 'compositions', 'perfect', 'haunting', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'right', 'money', 'Carpenter', 'vision', 'contained', 'next', 'blood', 'very', 'small', 'body', 'count', 'What', 'original', 'HALLOWEEN', 'so', 'deliciously', 'frightening', 'anticipation', 'violence.Most', 'know', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'tale', 'Halloween', 'night', '6-year-old', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'sister', 'sex', 'boyfriend', 'sent', 'mental', 'institution', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'returns', 'stomping', 'grounds', 'round', 'terror.Writer/Director', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'outset', 'version', 'more', 'exposition', 'original', 'stupendous', 'error', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'back', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'pathetic', 'Little', 'Michael', 'kills', 'animals', 'picked', 'school', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'masks', 'Dr.', 'Samuel', 'Loomis', 'best', 'try', 'rehab', 'young', 'boy', 'avail', 'Michael', 'pure', 'evil', 'know', 'going', 'Zombie', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'nonsense', 'inexplicable.The', 'excessive', 'first', 'few', 'reels', 'make', 'second', 'half', 'frustrating', 'bore', 'Once', 'Michael', 'escapes', 'hospital', 'film', 'basically', 'retread', 'original', 'NO', 'suspense', 'just', 'whole', 'lot', 'spurting', 'blood', 'killing', 'really', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'canceled', 'out', 'almost', 'immediately', 'feel', 'nothing', 'Worst', 'hero', 'original', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'reduced', 'supporting', 'player', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'know', 'hour', 'mark', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'care', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'making', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'Michael', 'sister', 'was', 'never', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'intention', 'Michael', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'pure', 'evil', 'killing', 'spree', 'Box', 'office', 'profits', 'contractual', 'sequel', 'forced', 'Carpenter', 'come', 'up', 'particular', 'tie-in', 'part', 'two', 'often', 'said', 'never', 'liked', 'one', 'original', '1978', 'film', 'mention', 'Laurie', 'relationship', 'Michael', 'Meyers', 'even', 'hinted', 'overlong', 'prelude', 'Meyers', 'childhood', 'what', 'Zombie', 'ultimately', 'done', 'turn', 'Michael', 'film', 'hero', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'despicable', 'impossible', 'root', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'janitor', 'who', 'Michael', 'institution', 'Zombie', 'trailer', 'trash', 'humor', 'all-around', 'filth', 'nothing', 'only', 'serve', 'elicit', 'smirk', 'tiny', 'sense', 'disgust', 'viewer.The', 'sad', 'fact', 'incompetent', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'examine', 'Just', 'one', 'more', 'brand', 'name', 'rip-off', 'name', 'quick', 'buck', 'complete', 'debasement', 'groundbreaking', 'original', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'can', 'rest', 'easy', 'version', 'will', 'never', 'replace', 'amazing', 'still', 'very', 'scary', '1978', 'masterpiece']",Halloween

After all, there are no really bad sequels in this series (with the exception of Halloween III which isn't a real horrible movie itself, but has nothing to to with the Michael Myers story and therefore really has no relevance). There has been no ""Michael in Space"" or ""Zombie Michael Myers that gets buried and resurrected"" plots in this series, and for that, I have to commend them for that. However, when I first heard about this ""remake"" of the original Halloween, I thought it was a terrible idea. Why in the world would you want to remake a classic like Halloween? Its just like all these other remakes that seem to dominate theaters these days. Can't anyone think of anything original anymore? And almost all these remakes are no not even close to being as good as the original film. There's absolutely no reason to remake a film like Halloween unless its only to cash in. And that's probably the real reason why this movie was even considered being made in the first place. These people know that its gonna bring in horror fans, both young and old, out of the woodwork. And of course, fans are gonna be critical and compare the two films relentlessly. So to all the movie producers and film makers out there..STOP REMAKING CLASSIC FILMS!! All you guys are doing is watering down and for the most part ruining the reputations of actual good movies!! Okay, now that off of my chest, let's start the review, shall we?First of all, to say that this is purely a remake is incorrect. Its half prequel, half remake, really. But when I found out that Rob Zombie would be writing and directing the picture, my hopes got much brighter about the film. I love House of the 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, and I really thought that he would bring something new to the series but without screwing everything up. After watching the film in theaters, and now on DVD, I can't say that he didn't bring something new to Halloween series, but for the most part, I definitely think he did more harm than good. I just have a hard time accepting this movie as being anything but mediocre, really. There's just way too many things that I didn't like about the actual plot of the story, and yes, way too many differences, and flat out contradictions of that of the original Halloween. I know, maybe its unfair to compare it the original Halloween so closely, but dammit, I can't help it. I love the original film. Its gotta be one the best horror films ever made. And just don't like the fact that someone can come in and nearly change everything about it, and yet call it, if only partially in this case, a remake.First off, almost all the backstory of the young Michael Myers is total contradiction to the original film. Yeah, I know there wasn't really anything shown or told about Myers' childhood or family life in any of the films, but then again, there was no hint of anything BAD happening to him either! Why did Zombie feel the need to put in every bad cliche into the home life of young Michael Myers. Living in a trashy environment, a stripper mom, an abusive, drunk father figure, a bitch of a sister, being bullied at school, being neglected, and the list goes on an on. It seems like Zombie was GIVING Michael Myers a reason to become the monster he became! That's not what the original film was about. The great thing about that film was the idea that no one knew why Michael did what he did. He had no reason. That's what's scary about it. How a normal boy could do something like that without a cause. But here, you don't have that.Another thing I didn't like was the acting and the portrayal of some of the characters, especially the Lorrie Strode character played by Scout Taylor-Compton. She's just so damn annoying!! Geez, Jamie Lee Curtis did such a good job of playing the ""girl next door"" role, and here you have a annoying, bubbly, whore wanna be. I know that you gotta modernize the characters a bit, but c'mon! I was wanting Michael to kill Lorrie a minute into her first scene, not to mention her friends, which were just as bad! Now it is worth mentioning, that when the chase scenes with Lorrie and Michael begin, Taylor-Compton actually does a pretty good acting good there. Also, Daeg Faerch, who played young Michael Myers, and well as Sheri Moon Zombie, who played Michael's mother, Deborah, just didn't fit the parts to me. Faerch acting wasn't all that great, and he just didn't look the part, and Sheri Moon's acting was alright, but seeing her play that kind of role just doesn't look right to me. And Malcolm McDowell didn't exactly put on a brilliant performance himself either.Other things I didn't like..well.. the scene where 10 year old Michael kills his sister in his trademark mask just looks, well..stupid. The mask is huge and looks dumb on a child's body, and its not scary at all. Not even a little. And speaking of body, I really thought that the Michael Myers character was too physically big. Michael Myers is supposed just some average looking guy, not a professional wrestler, so why make him so larger than life? The way Michael seems to ""grunt"" numerous times in the film, what the heck is up with that? And the way Michael seems to try ""interrogate"" Lorrie's step mom by showing her Lorrie's picture and I assume, trying to find where she was at..just way out of the Michael Myers character for me. I also thought the music was mis-used in the film. At times, it felt like Zombie was trying to use the music to build a mood, when there was really nothing there to build upon.Alright, enough of the bashing of this film. I actually have some good things to say about it. After all, I am giving it 3 stars! First off, I like the blood gore content. A definite step up from the original, though just to make things clear, you don't need blood and guts and gore to make a film, nor does that stuff make a film good. But I'm just saying I liked that aspect of this film. Also, the guys who did the Michael Myers mask did a great job on this one. It looks real close to the original mask. And speaking of the mask, Tyler Mane does a pretty decent job of portraying Michael Myers as well. I also felt that the last half hour of the film was real good too. I especially liked the scenes where Lorrie was hiding from Michael in-between the walls and in the loft of the house. I thought Zombie really did a good job there.So finally I've come to the end of this ungodly long review! Thanks to those you've actually read this whole thing. In closing, I know that I'm probably being too critical about some of the things I didn't like about this film. And if I had never seen the original, or wasn't a big fan of the original film, I probably wouldn't be so critical and be picking out every single little thing that's different from the original. I know that when a remake of a film is made, you can't simply copy everything from the original, otherwise, what's the point in remaking it? But on the other hand, how can you call something a remake, when in fact, there are so few similarities between it and the original? There's got to be some balance somewhere. Anyways,as a stand alone film, maybe its better than I'm giving it credit for. And if it hadn't been a ""Halloween"" movie, and just another horror film, I might have loved it. And again, that's why I'm giving it a benefit of a doubt and trying to ignore my biased opinion and giving this film 3 stars. However, I can't help to compare to the original classic. And this one doesn't ever really come close in capturing the mood or suspense that the original film did. And as far as comparing to the other films in the series, this is one of the worse. Is it worth watching or worth owning? I say yes to both. But its nothing really great to watch, and I wouldn't say its a ""must buy"" unless you have all the other Halloween films and need for your collection. And thats one of the very few reasons, I own this film right now.",3,2.5 Stars: I just have too many problems with this movie to really like it..,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,8170,"['Halloween',

1102701,A3P1A63Q8L32C5,B000VKL6Z2,T. Lobascio,"[11, 15]","In early September, I went to the theater to see Rob Zombie's 2007 version of Halloween, and despite my reservations over the very notion of a remake of the 1978 classic--Not to mention a few controversies along the way--I wanted to give the film a fair shake...Put simply--the update is a mess and really makes you appreciate the genius of John Carpenter and Debra Hill back in '78.As a 10 year old child, Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) brutally kills his sister Judith (Hanna Hall) and his stepfather (William Forsythe). Shortly thereafter, young Michael is put in an asylum and placed under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell).Years later, the boy, now an emotionless catatonic man has escaped back to his hometown of Haddonfield to complete the murderous rampage. that began all of those years ago. Now, the adult Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) is back, and his hometown is about to find out that there is no escape from pure evil.One of the strengths of the Carpenter version of Halloween is its ability to scare viewers using suspense and shock-without having to depend on gore--to tell its story. While I realize Zombie wanted to make the 2007 flick as different as possible, having no desire to make a shot for shot retread, his film uses blood and gore to make up for the fact that his film is just NOT scary.Even though Zombie keeps the framework of the story in tact, he wastes golden chances to scare us--with the new stuff. As I feared, knowing too much of Myers' backstory just weighs everything down like an anchor. I wouldn't have minded spending 40 minutes learning how screwed up little Mikey's home life is....but frankly, as presented it's quite uninteresting.The series already tried explaining the Shape's origin in Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers with mixed results (see Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers, the Producers' Cut for more details). I agree with the Carpenter/Hill approach that ""less is more""-allowing the audience to guess at the killers whys--rather than leading us there--keeping him a mythological figure or evil force--more or less...Once the film moves into more familiar terrain though, most of that material is either dropped all together or truncated to get to its new conclusionI actually feel bad for the cast of the movie. Everyone gives it their best shot, but thanks to bad writing by Zombie--most of the characters are given stiff and silly dialogue to utter--with the F-Word thrown in for good measure--a lot.Many of the movie's great supporting players are wasted here. Dee Wallace, playing Mrs. Strode is introduced quickly and has only one really meaty scene after that... Danielle Harris (who is well known to the franchise faithful having played Jaime Lloyd in both Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5) plays Annie, fares a bit better with screen time but deserves better material.When I first heard that Malcolm McDowell would be playing Dr Sam Loomis, as a fan of most of his work, I actually was pretty jazzed.

I realized I was getting angry because Rob's movie wasn't following the original. What a silly thing! To want a cookie-cutter REMAKE when Rob's movie was a clever and successful 'reimagining'.Don't watch this movie expecting Halloween. Watch it as a stand-alone movie, and you will appreciate what a good job Rob Zombie did at what seemed to be an impossible task (equalling the original). The movie does take quite a while to really get rolling, so stick with it. Once the good stuff arrives (and you all know what that means) there are some truly frightening and suspenseful scenes (and better than the original!).

This remake is different from the original and Zombie's remake of Halloween came as a total surprise to me; I didn't expect to like it at all and thought that he was going to ruin a classic of horror films. It goes deeper into the original Halloween story which I thought was fascinating and well done, it explains things and gives the movie more depth. I liked how the movie started with Michael Myers as a child and the flashback sequences which explained what just happened as Myers killed members of his family. You see an interview with Myers as a child and the setting is very interesting it tries to explain what happened. Then the movie progresses to the point where he is older and escapes from prison and murders people. There is more gore and everything seems more brutal than in the original which was to be expected and makes it more according to today's standards in horror movies. Some things are different and entertaining and are not an exact copy of the original scene by scene which I thought was well done and creative of Rob Zombie. It's like he took the movie and added things to it and made it his own.Most remakes tend to be pretty bad (even if there are some great ones) and contrary to what many fans thought of Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween I actually enjoyed it and found it was a decent remake. Make no mistake this remake is not as good as the original one and it will never be I just think it was good and that it gave the movie an interesting twist to it.

1102708,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000VKL6Z2,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","While I was watching Rob Zombie's new ""Halloween,"" I was truly amazed by two things: its length and violence. Having seen his films ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects,"" I knew what I was going to see in this revamped version, but I never expected he would spend so much time (more than 30 minutes) to show Michael Myers as a 10-year-old bullied boy (played by Daeg Faerch, who is certainly convincing).I will not write here the details of his family; I only say it is not very pleasant to see, but maybe that is the point. Maybe Rob Zombie is just trying to give Michael a social background, something few people care. I am afraid it only deprives this horror icon of its superhuman presence. Tyler Mane did a very good job as grown-up Michael Myers, but the long introductory part that tried to (sort of) explain him has made the new ""Halloween"" just another serial killer movie.And this film is very gory. It also has nudities (more than once). Not that I am complaining. Screaming Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is again chased by Michael Myers, and to his credit Rob Zombie has made each sequence competently, but that is all. What is shown here looks clich&eacute;d, familiar to those who have seen other slasher films, except the unique cast including William Forsythe, Danny Trejo, Bill Moseley, Brad Dourif, Richard Lynch, Dee Wallace, Sid Haig and Sybil Danning. Blink your eyes and you will miss Udo Kier and Clint Howard. (And ex-Monkees Micky Dolenz? Where was he?)I have watched the original ""Halloween"" long time ago, but I still remember some of the film's scenes were really creepy. But they were not about Michael Myers as killing machine murdering his victims; they were about Michael Myers just standing in the street as if he is something supernatural coming from another world. From the strictly technical viewpoint, Rob Zombie's re-imagined version is decent. It is only that John Carpenter's vision is replaced by Zombie's relentless descriptions of violence, which was seen in his previous films.

1102709,ADMKFEIC38V51,B000VKL6Z2,"T. W. Cramer ""Ty""","[2, 6]","It seems that Rob Zombie's efforts are usually hit or miss. Unfortunately, this one slips somewhere between the cracks of both. I'm not going to relay the story, as several people already have, but instead I'd like to lay out a few key points (positive and negative) on the film.The first act of the film deals with Michael Myer's childhood and the reasons behind his descent into madness. The original film provided us with no real reason for his bloodthirst and honestly...did we really need a explanation? Isn't it scarier to NOT know? Regardless, I was hoping the same as everyone else that Zombie would come up with a creative and original idea...he did not. Micheal Myers is an unstoppable serial killer because he was picked on in school, his mom was a stripper and his home life sucked. Seriously, that's it?! THAT is what we've been waiting for? I could turn on any daytime drama and find the same tired old plot. To make it even less appealing we are literally birraged with over-the-top foul language and brutal violence. Mr. Zombie seems to be in the mind set that violent images and grotesque deaths are more important than any actual scares in his ""horror"" movie.The second act has Micheal in Smith's Grove. Personally, I found this entire sequence to be boring. We get it...the kid is nuts. To make matters worse the ""unrated"" version contains the most un-necessary rape scene in film history. It serves no purpose other than to simply ""shock"" the audience. Just because you make something controversial Rob, doesn't mean that it's good.The best part of the film is the third act, where we meet Laurie Strode and her friends (the re-make kickoff). There are some decent moments in the third act and even a few unexpected scares. Rob used the audience's knowledge of the first film as a manipulation tool. I could go on and on with the issues I have but there is one that is so outstanding I can't get over it. The dialogue is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. It seems like the lines were written the day of shooting. When Lori and her friends are in the library she has the following line...""Annie wants me to pretend to babysit Lindsay-Wallace, then sneak out and dump her with me so she can go and see Paul.""That doesn't even make sense. At all. Who wrote this? And it's just not in this scene, but in fact the entire ""Girl talk"" dialogue that happens is so cheestastic you can't help but laugh. The best lines in the film were imports from the original film with one or two words changed to a synonym (good job, Rob).The bottom line is, the negatives of this film FAR outweigh the positive. Mr. Zombie needs to worry less about making stylized 70s' trash and more about making a HORROR MOVIE.And if you're wondering what more we're getting in the 11 minutes...well...naked girls being raped and murdered. Yay.

Looking at it entirely from the perspective of the remake and trying to put Carpenter's admittedly classic original out of my head, I thought the backstory was fascinating, I also thought the first 40 minutes or so were the best part of Zombie's reimagining, and when Michael was breaking out of the compound to go on his signature rampage, I was particularly happy with the film (Michael's relationship with Danny Trejo is one of the best elements of the film).However, when the focus turns to Haddonfield, the film turns to s---. Zombie has cast, or written -- in the case of the main character, I'm not really sure -- the three most annoying girls in the history of cinema. Every line out of their mouths made my head ache and I longed for the characters from the original movie. Even Danielle Harris, who was fairly charming in Halloween 4 and 5, is as shrill and grating as the other two. The only advantage to Zombie's movie in this aspect is that since it spends so much time with Michael as a boy, this section of the movie is naturally sped up. After Michael had dispatched a couple of them the movie started to get back on track, but had this section resembled Carpenter's more closely, I might have just turned the movie off.Regardless, I thought Halloween 07 was interesting. For all the horrible, uninspiring, Xerox-level remakes out there (like, for instance, the shot-for-shot remake Quarantine, which at every opportunity has spoiled the original, [REC] for me), at least Zombie made a film that is unquestionably his, containing hallmarks and themes from the original, but is a distinctly different film.",3,It's not the backstory.,1223769600,"10 12, 2008",2008,1787,"['so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'railed', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'same', 'reasoning', 'backstory', 'Michael', 'less', 'scary', 'wanted', 'present', 'alternate', 'opinion', 'Looking', 'entirely', 'perspective', 'remake', 'trying', 'put', 'Carpenter', 'admittedly', 'classic', 'original', 'head', 'thought', 'backstory', 'was', 'fascinating', 'also', 'thought', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'were', 'best', 'part', 'Zombie', 'reimagining', 'when', 'Michael', 'was', 'breaking', 'compound', 'go', 'signature', 'rampage', 'was', 'particularly', 'happy', 'film', 'Michael', 'relationship', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'one', 'best', 'elements', 'film', '.However', 'when', 'focus', 'Haddonfield', 'film', 's', 'Zombie', 'cast', 'written', 'case', 'main', 'character', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'three', 'most', 'annoying', 'girls', 'history', 'cinema', 'line', 'mouths', 'made', 'head', 'ache', 'longed', 'characters', 'original', 'movie', 'Even', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'who', 'was', 'fairly', 'charming', 'Halloween', '4', '5', 'shrill', 'grating', 'other', 'two', 'only', 'advantage', 'Zombie', 'movie', 'aspect', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'Michael', 'boy', 'section', 'movie', 'naturally', 'sped', 'up', 'Michael', 'had', 'dispatched', 'couple', 'movie', 'started', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'had', 'section', 'resembled', 'Carpenter', 'more', 'closely', 'might', 'have', 'just', 'turned', 'movie', 'off.Regardless', 'thought', 'Halloween', '07', 'was', 'interesting', 'horrible', 'uninspiring', 'Xerox-level', 'remakes', 'there', 'instance', 'shot-for-shot', 'remake', 'Quarantine', 'opportunity', 'spoiled', 'original', '[', 'REC', ']', 'least', 'Zombie', 'made', 'film', 'unquestionably', 'containing', 'hallmarks', 'themes', 'original', 'distinctly', 'different', 'film']",Halloween

All originals were independent productions made with limited budgets that found worldwide success due to the fact they were simply well made original films. Leave it to Hollywood to do some sloppy cut n paste jobs with some hack/poser directors cashing in hard earned name recognition, basically they see something so old making more money consistently over the years when their modern dull horror flicks fail to be remembered once they're out of theaters so they create some mock-ups with the same name and cut in front of line. All these new horror remakes are BORING to their very core, the violence isn't even ""XTREEEME"" as they try to make it out to be, even if there is more blood than the originals (well Dawn of The Dead remake was no where near as graphic as the original on top of being moronic/annoying).Well here's Rob Zombie's Halloween. Rob Zombie is a terrible writer and a lousy director, he belongs directing Saw movies or some straight to DVD horror flicks, this is easily the worst horror remake since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it might be even worse than that one. The film has vague character outlines but nothing much else, and don't say it doesn't matter because a good hour of this movie is devoted to fall-flat-on-its-face character development that is nonexistent. There is setup, location, some empty lines, and well its so amateurish, either the door is wide open for some real talent to save horror or it really is over for the genre.The payoff at the end of the film is very cut n paste. Its no better or worse than any Halloween sequel, well its not even as good as 2 or 4. Since its a new movie the camera is constantly shaking around and there's that fake ""realistic"" brutality/dying/screaming acting that is so forced its just annoying. There is nothing worse in my opinion than something that believes it is truly shocking and in your face when in truth it is very plain and kind of dull. Every minute of this movie is like that down to the throwaway horror cameo characters, which are haphazard cussfests that attempt to be funny but are just, I dunno, lame. Zombie's downtrodden ""everyone is stupid"" modernistic attitude kills every frame of the movie, as if none of the characters he wastes over an hour on matter because MICHAEL MYERS is coming and this time he seems to be based on professional wrestler Kane or The Undertaker. Which is fitting, this is a very modern mall goth approach to story telling, and Rob Zombie is mall metal with an audience that could never hope to name the origins of horror film samples found in his music so I don't know. Michael Myers jumps out and stabs lots of people but its nothing too graphic or interesting, there's no suspense, buildup or pay off. Its just kind of there.John Carpenter's early films were minimalist, Rob Zombie films are excessive, so its only ironic his film comes off as an empty exercise in generic slasher fare.

1102714,A3I49HL6XR62DI,B000VKL6Z2,Victoria A. Wildermuth,"[1, 3]","This is not Rob Zombie's best film. That honor goes toThe Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition), Zombie's visceral, shocking and funny tribute to B-movie gorefests. Halloween is an extremely weak re-make of John Carpenter's masterpiece,Halloween (Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition). The most innovative and creative part of Zombie's film is the first hour where he explores the birth of a serial killer. Zombie's extraordinary depiction of Michael's life in a hellish home where domestic violence is the norm and sexually explicit language abounds is so well done. The young actor who portrays Michael is perfect. Sherri Moon Zombie plays Michael's mother quite well and even throws in a pole dance for good measure. Michael's life in a mental institution is also extremely well done, culminating in a bloody murder spree as he escapes. One wishes Zombie had stopped there and called the film: ""Halloween: The Beginning"". Unfortunately,the last 45 minutes of the film consists of an extremely weak and hurried remake of Carpenter's original film. Laurie Stode, Michael's sister, is so annoying that you will want to kill her yourself. She wines and screams all the time and it's merciful when Michael kills her equally annoying friends. The last 20 mintues of this bloody mess are pure agony -- a confusing mishmash of mayhem as Michael knocks holes in an attic, trying to pry Laurie out. So dumb. I must, however, compliment Malcom McDowell on his performance as Dr. Loomis. He brings dignity to a role that was owned by Donald Pleasance. An odd and annoying thing about this film is the confusion about the time in which it is set. The musical soundtrack is late 70's, but people are using cell phones. Guys have long hair, but girls are wearing clothes that appear to be at least 90's stuff. Just makes your head want to explode. Runtime is about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Way too long and absolutely exhausting. Trust me, the original and most of its sequels are better ways to spend your time.",3,Gimme a machete and I'll take out Laurie Strode!!,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,2001,"['not', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'best', 'film', 'honor', 'toThe', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Zombie', 'visceral', 'shocking', 'funny', 'tribute', 'B-movie', 'gorefests', 'Halloween', 'extremely', 'weak', 're-make', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'masterpiece', 'Halloween', 'Divimax', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'most', 'innovative', 'creative', 'part', 'Zombie', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'where', 'birth', 'serial', 'killer', 'Zombie', 'extraordinary', 'depiction', 'Michael', 'life', 'hellish', 'home', 'where', 'domestic', 'violence', 'norm', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'language', 'abounds', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'Michael', 'perfect', 'Sherri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'Michael', 'mother', 'quite', 'well', 'even', 'throws', 'pole', 'dance', 'good', 'measure', 'Michael', 'life', 'mental', 'institution', 'also', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'culminating', 'bloody', 'murder', 'spree', 'One', 'Zombie', 'had', 'stopped', 'there', 'called', 'film', 'Halloween', 'Beginning', 'Unfortunately', 'last', '45', 'minutes', 'film', 'extremely', 'weak', 'hurried', 'remake', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'film', 'Laurie', 'Stode', 'Michael', 'sister', 'so', 'annoying', 'will', 'want', 'kill', 'screams', 'time', 'merciful', 'when', 'Michael', 'equally', 'annoying', 'friends', 'last', '20', 'mintues', 'bloody', 'mess', 'are', 'pure', 'agony', 'confusing', 'mishmash', 'mayhem', 'Michael', 'holes', 'attic', 'trying', 'pry', 'Laurie', 'out', 'So', 'dumb', 'must', 'however', 'compliment', 'Malcom', 'McDowell', 'performance', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'dignity', 'role', 'was', 'owned', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'odd', 'annoying', 'thing', 'film', 'confusion', 'time', 'set', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'late', '70', 'people', 'are', 'using', 'cell', 'phones', 'Guys', 'have', 'long', 'hair', 'girls', 'are', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'appear', 'be', 'least', '90', 'stuff', 'Just', 'head', 'want', 'explode', 'Runtime', '1', 'hour', '45', 'minutes', 'Way', 'too', 'long', 'absolutely', 'exhausting', 'Trust', 'original', 'most', 'sequels', 'are', 'better', 'ways', 'spend', 'time']",Halloween
1102715,AWJC2DP07N5ZM,B000VKL6Z2,"Vladimir Moya ""Vlad""","[1, 2]","Rob Zombie's ""re-imagination"" of the 70s classic ""Halloween"" has several pros and several cons. My rating is 3 stars. Now I will break down my reasons. The first 40 minutes of this movie are fantastic! Zombie gives Michael Myers a childhood, a family and a cause for his ""evil"". In the original, Michael was a faceless supernatural force of nature. He existed just to kill and we never really found out why. Zombie tries to dig deep into the character of Michael and he tries to humanize him. I think he succeeds in the beginning, Michael as a child, played brilliantly by Daeg Farch is a sympathetic character. He lives in a hellish 70s environment, his mother Deborah is a stripper, his sister Judith a slut, his stepfather Ronnie verbally abuses everyone in the household. Michael's only respite is his infant sister who he calls Boo. This all comes to ahead one Halloween night when Michael wants to go trick-or-treating. Mom tells Sister to take Mike out but Sis is too busy getting banged by her bf. So Mike just sits on the porch while Mom strips and the rest of the family does their thing. Mike gets revenge by going postal on the whole family except for Boo. This is different than in the original as in this movie Mike kills 3 instead of just 1. This lands him at the sanitarium where he is counseled by Dr Loomis played well by the great Malcolm McDowell. Zombie does a great casting job by getting McDowell to replace the late great Donald Pleasance in the Loomis role. The interactions between McDowell and young Farch are some of the best scenes in the whole movie. Michael has murdered his entire family except his mother and baby sister yet he claims not to remember any of it. Michael wants to leave the sanitarium but of course he is not allowed to as Dr Loomis explains because he has ""done terrible things"". Due to his incarceration, Michael is slowly delving into madness. He is obsessed with making masks of all colors and kinds. This is a clever plot twist from the original movie. One day when Michael is being visited by Mom, Michael stabs a nurse with a fork. This scene is very well done by Zombie as all we hear is a siren going off yet we see Michael screaming at his mother because she took off his mask. The movie then jumps ahead 15 years. Michael is now a long-haired giant played by Tyler Mane. He still makes masks but now he is completely mute. Dr Loomis informs Michael that he is quitting because Michael is making no progress. Michael will now be transferred to a minimum security sanitarium. As he is being transferred by 4 armed guards Michael breaks his shackles and makes mincemeat out of his guards. This scene is dynamic and it proves that Rob Zombie is great at visuals and making dramatic scenes. The last great scene of this movie is where Michael invades a truck stop and kills a huge trucker for his clothes. There is a problem here though. Time has not seemed to have passed even though 15 years have gone by during Michael's incarceration. The music and fashions are still stuck in the late 70s. That's one con of this movie. The rest of the movie is basically a waste. Instead of doing something different Zombie decides to simply reshoot the entire original movie in the 30 minutes of the movie. Unfortunately, the actors that Zombie gets to play Laurie Strode and her friends are not real actors they just use expletives a lot and try to act like teenagers even though they all look on the wrong side of 25. Scout Taylor Compton who replaces the great Jamie Leigh Curtis in the Laurie Strode role is not fit to even shine Curtis' shoes with her tongue. She is an awful actress but she is not alone. The other ""actors"" that play her friends and the kid that plays Tommy Doyle are a complete waste and I will be surprised if they ever work in a movie again at least one not made by Rob Zombie. The last part of the movie feels completely rushed and forced. It's as if Zombie used all of his creativity in the first 40 minutes and with nothing left he just decides to reshoot the original again with lousy non-actors. I think that if Zombie reflects on this movie he will realize that he made a big mistake. The original movie did not need to be reshot. Also the whole brother-sister angle should have been trashed. In the original 1978 movie John Carpenter never intended for Michael and Laurie to be siblings. His idea was that Laurie was a virgin with no boyfriend and a lot of sexual frustration and somehow her frustration summons Michael back to his hometown.  He stalks and chases her because he is trying to be her lover but tragically he can't because he is insane. It is this idea that Zombie should have used for his re-imagination. The whole brother-sister angle was a cheap way that other directors used to make more sequels Carpenter NEVER intended for his original to have a sequel. If Zombie had used Carpenter's idea in a different way then he could've made something really special and a perfect remake, instead his remake deserves only 3 stars because of the first half of the movie, the last part of the movie is loud annoying and utterly unnecessary.",3,"Ok remake, falls apart at the end",1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,5124,"['Rob', 'Zombie', 're-imagination', '70s',

1102720,A15U46ZENEHGTH,B000VKL6Z2,Wicked_Smaht,"[4, 7]","Once upon a time, someone decided it would be a great idea to let Rob Zombie make a movie: the result was a piece of crap known as ""House of 1000 Corpses"". Oddly enough, someone gave him money again and he came up with an even worse piece of crap: ""The Devil's Rejects"". Though showing no real talent nor any real distinct vision, someone decided to give ol' Rob the reigns on a ""Halloween"" remake and he delivered... yet another piece of crap. Only this piece of crap is destined to be compared to a rather simple, yet effective modern horror classic and what many consider to be the springboard for the modern slasher film.People will say it's unfair to compare this remake with the original film that inspired it, but then those are probably the same un-thinking clowns who thought this whole enterprise would be a good idea anyways. Look, it's a film called ""Halloween"" with a storyline that mirrors a previous film called ""Halloween"" - how do you not compare the two? More importantly, this remake is so inept that you really can't help but think of the original and what it did (or didn't do) more effectively. If you were doing a remake of a small foreign film that no one ever heard of, you could probably get away without much comparison, but when you remake a film this well-known, you're pretty much asking for it... and crying foul when people do so seems a little ridiculous on your part.Side Note: that particular criticism never makes any sense because the basic argument is that you should be open-minded enough to accept a new interpretation on an old idea, but the argument really works both ways. If you tell someone the remake sucked and the original was better, they often counter with how the original sucked and the remake was better. Aren't the people who champion the remake just as guilty of being closed-minded as those who deride it? Talk about a pot/kettle moment.With that being said, Zombie gives us almost an hour of unnecessary backstory before propelling us into the by-the-numbers slasher plot that most viewers are accustomed to. Here it is in a nutshell: Michael Myers is a pudgy demented kid who has an equally annoying family and is taunted by even more annoying bullies. One day he snaps because this is pre-Jerry Springer so he can't go on television to get it all out of his system. After an hour of this, it's more-or-less Carpenter's original film as Michael, now a human tank, hacks and slashes his way back to Haddonfield in order to do... um... something. Zombie's script combines elements of the original ""Halloween"" and elements from ""Halloween II"" and tries to make you more sympathetic to Michael's mental imbalance. There's a lot of psychological mumbo-jumbo that doesn't really go anywhere and there's lots of ambiguity concerning what Michael's ultimate goal really was.In the meantime, you get plenty of bad acting, multiple amounts of T&A; (sans Mrs. Zombie - sometimes it pays to be married to the director) and no real scares. To say it's all rather unnecessary is putting it mildly. The only real fun to be had is by hardcore horror buffs who can make a game out of spotting-the-C-list celebrity (is that Mickey Dolenz? Hey, Ken Foree! Oh, it's Dee Wallace!) This is the only cheap thrill that the film seems to muster and aside from some clever casting, the movie really doesn't have much going for it. Since it's clear that the main focus of this film is Michael Myers, all the other characters are largely ancillary. Scout Taylor-Compton proves she's totally incapable of playing a convincing teenager (hired because Zombie felt she ""wasn't too actor-y"" - truer words were never said), though it's not entirely her fault since Zombie feels more at home writing scenes that feature the worst of cussing white trash than scenes of actual believable people. Laurie's friends are largely forgettable, but it is fun to see Danielle Harris (particularly if you remember her from previous sequels to the original ""Halloween""). Here, she's mostly unnecessary and you sort of wish she was playing Laurie, though that would just send the fans of the original ""Halloween"" films into a mental geekgasm tailspin.It's always fun to see Malcolm McDowell and Danny Trejo in nearly anything, but here they don't serve much purpose. Donald Pleasance may have only served the purpose to spout a lot of jargon about the nature of evil in the original films, but he chewed the scenery quite nicely and he's sorely missed here. Michael's nemesis, Sam Loomis, is largely underdeveloped here - so much so, that he's practically unnecessary, which is a shame because there's only so much you can do with a film centered around a walking slaughterhouse who's mute. Speaking of, there's Daeg Faerch, who plays young Michael Myers and he's horrible. Some people praised his performance, but I'm not sure they saw the same kid I did. He's unpleasant to look at (which you think would help when playing Michael Myers) and he's unconvincing. Apparently, he filmed scenes for Zombie's ""Halloween II"" but was cut because he was too tall, so they got another kid. This automatically makes ""Halloween II"" a better movie, but that's a whole other review all together.Also, since this is a Rob Zombie film, Sherri Moon Zombie is in this and plays Michael's mother in the rather-lengthy backstory. Strangely, she's the only seemingly likable character in the whole film and seems to be the only character somewhat fleshed out (pun intended, cuz see... Michael's mother is a stripper in this film. However, paradoxically, Sherri seems to be one of the few female cast members who isn't nude in this film. Go figure.) The rest of the cast isn't of particular interest, so there's no real point in talking about them.So, aside from some bad acting, what else makes the film seem so shoddy? Well, it's crystal clear that Zombie has an obvious affinity for late 70's horror films reminiscent of Wes Craven or Tobe Hooper, however, most horror fans won't admit that most of the horror films of that particular era just weren't very good, so it seems a somewhat odd choice of era to emulate with a film that's trying to appeal to today's youth. At any rate, there Zombie goes and succeeds in making us not like a single character on the screen. Quite a feat, really. Unfortunately, by doing this, we have no one to really sympathize with (sorry, I don't sympathize with Michael Myers either. Yeah, he had a bad childhood, but he seems just as likely to end up as Marilyn Manson as Michael Myers - the unstoppable killing machine.) With no one to sympathize with, it doesn't really matter what happens in the rest of the movie and, quite frankly, this film doesn't try really hard to generate any suspense. In that sense, I guess Zombie did succeed in emulating the likes of something like Wes Craven's original ""The Last House on the Left"": things just sort of happen and they film it, but it's not like you care about it too much.There are also several other issues you seem to think about while watching this movie that cause you to not really care for it. For me, it was the following:1.) What timeframe do the two halves of the movie take place in? The first half seems like the late 70's/early 80's, but the second half - supposedly taking place only 15 years later, has a clear post-2000 vibe.2.) What is with the long hair? Nearly everyone in this film has annoying long hair (even Malcolm McDowell for quite awhile)... and it usually hangs in front of their face. WTF? This isn't scary, just annoying.3.) If I have to watch one more horror film that features Blue Oyster Cult's ""Don't Fear The Reaper"", I will spend my own savings to buy the rights to that song just so I can not license it to anybody and I don't have to hear that song in another horror film ever again.4.) How come Michael emphatically kills some people, but lets others live for no discernable reason? Zombie establishes earlier that Michael has no boundaries (seemingly, the reason why Danny Trejo is killed), but then he lets Danielle Harris survive and Sam Loomis is only incapacitated. Guess you can't kill fan favorites in case there's a sequel.5.) What's Michael's plan? He kills one of Laurie's friends and places the Myers tombstone above her and then abducts Laurie and shoves a picture at her that she has no idea how to interpret. Is his plan to kill her or just resume being a family again? Sure, things are just as ambiguous in the original, but here, they went through all the effort to explain Michael, yet his motivations are still entirely unclear.6.) In both this film and the original, how come kids (and teenagers) running down a suburban street yelling ""Help! Help!"" never elicit any response from any neighbors... ever?7.) When Laurie called 911 to help her friend Annie (Danielle Harris), the cops show up at the house Laurie runs back to though she called to get to help at the house that Annie was in. Later, Loomis and the sherriff (as well as an ambulance) show up at the house Annie is in and seem to ignore the patrol car (with lights flashing) at the other residence that Laurie went back to. How does the emergency crew know to show up at different houses?8.) That ""Trick or Treat"" title card... really? What was that for?Maybe I'm too meticulous in my nitpicking, but with a boring movie, you tend to think of these things. All in all, there's nothing to recommend this movie and you're not missing much if you never see it. I would recommend picking up the original. Though it's definitely dated, it's far more effective and really utilizes the theme of the holiday (the original film used traditional Halloween lore and activities far more extensively thus making the title appropriate. In the remake, it really doesn't matter if it's Halloween or not - these events seem like they could have taken place whenever.) In the end, I'm amazed this remake got made, but then again, Zombie made two previous films before this one and I'm really amazed that those got made, so I guess this shouldn't have been too much of a surprise.If you're a fan of Rob Zombie, you'll love this film. If you're a fan of John Carpenter, you'll definitely hate it. If you like angry rednecks yelling and swearing at each other every five seconds, you'll love this. If you like fleshed-out characters and actual acting, you'll hate this. If you enjoy gratuitous nudity and incomprehensible story plotting, you'll love this. If you enjoy competent filmmaking and a script worth being filmed, you'll hate this.Maybe Zombie will remake ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" next because that... well, that...

1102722,AAOWC8GXIHKGM,B000VKL6Z2,winehound89,"[3, 5]","John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN is one of the best horror films ever made, a true classic in every sense. It had the formula to which every other horror film after would use time and time again. It also introduced the world to one of the most terrifying forces of evil to ever grace the silver screen: Michael Myers. For me, the idea of someone remaking a classic horror like this is outrageous. The original ultimately proves best. Which is why I have given this four stars instead of five. But only for that reason and that reason alone.Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN is a complete re-imagining of the Michael Myers legend. We see Michael's home life post killing his eldest sister, as a troubled young boy obsessed with killing small animals and being picked on by bullies. His violent nature is already pre-determined in the first five minutes of the film which begs the question that Mr. Zombie places before us: Nature vs. Nurture. I'd like to think Michael was an ignored child but ultimately he was born evil. His mother tries hard to be there for her son, but with working nights as a stripper and making ends meet without the help of her lazy lump of a boyfriend she simply doesn't have the time. Growing up in this sort of environment you can't help but feel sorry for Michael in some aspects, but not everyone who comes from a dysfunctional or abusive home turns into a vicious killing machine. After Michael murders his mother's boyfriend, his eldest sister, and her boyfriend he is arrested and sent to a Mental Facility under the guidance of Dr. Sam Loomis. After years of analysing and trying to get through to Michael, 20 or so years pass and Loomis eventually gives up. Then of course Michael escapes and returns to his hometown and the rest is history.I can see perfectly clear where Rob Zombie was trying to go with this and I appalled him that he has in some ways pulled it off. I myself had my doubts, especially after seeing Rob Zombie's previous films HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES and THE DEVIL'S REJECTS. I think he knew that he had to treat this film with more respect considering the original's vast amount of fans who are just itching to troll him with negative comments about how he's ruined the series. No one can ruin the mark that the original film has left and in no way has this remake hurt it in any way shape or form. Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN isn't perfect, but it's better than most remakes Hollywood is chugging out.",4,Trick or Treat Mr. Zombie,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,2433,"['John', 'Carpenter', 'HALLOWEEN', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'true', 'classic', 'sense', 'had', 'formula', 'other', 'horror', 'film', 'would', 'use', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'also', 'introduced', 'world', 'one', 'most', 'terrifying', 'forces', 'evil', 'ever', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'idea', 'someone', 'remaking', 'classic', 'horror', 'outrageous', 'original', 'ultimately', 'best', 'Which', 'why', 'have', 'given', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'only', 'reason', 'reason', 'alone.Rob', 'Zombie', 'HALLOWEEN', 'complete', 're-imagining', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'legend', 'see', 'Michael', 'home', 'life', 'post', 'killing', 'eldest', 'sister', 'troubled', 'young', 'boy', 'obsessed', 'killing', 'small', 'animals', 'being', 'picked', 'bullies', 'violent', 'nature', 'already', 'pre-determined', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'question', 'Mr.', 'Zombie', 'Nature', 'vs.', 'Nurture', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'Michael', 'was', 'ignored', 'child', 'ultimately', 'was', 'born', 'evil', 'mother', 'hard', 'be', 'there', 'son', 'working', 'nights', 'stripper', 'making', 'ends', 'meet', 'help', 'lazy', 'lump', 'boyfriend', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'Growing', 'up', 'sort', 'environment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Michael', 'aspects', 'not', 'everyone', 'who', 'dysfunctional', 'abusive', 'home', 'vicious', 'killing', 'machine', 'Michael', 'murders', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'eldest', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'arrested', 'sent', 'Mental', 'Facility', 'guidance', 'Dr.', 'Sam', 'Loomis', 'years', 'analysing', 'trying', 'get', 'Michael', '20', 'so', 'years', 'pass', 'Loomis', 'eventually', 'up', 'Then', 'course', 'Michael', 'returns', 'hometown', 'rest', 'history.I', 'can', 'see', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'where', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'was', 'trying', 'go', 'appalled', 'ways', 'pulled', 'off', 'had', 'doubts', 'especially', 'seeing', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'previous', 'films', 'HOUSE', '1,000', 'CORPSES', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'REJECTS', 'think', 'knew', 'had', 'treat', 'film', 'more', 'respect', 'considering', 'original', 'vast', 'amount', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'itching', 'troll', 'negative', 'comments', 'how', 'ruined', 'series', 'one', 'can', 'ruin', 'mark', 'original', 'film', 'left', 'way', 'remake', 'hurt', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'HALLOWEEN', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'better', 'most', 'remakes', 'Hollywood', 'chugging', 'out']",Halloween

1102725,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000VKL6Z2,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[3, 5]","Ever since the announcement that Rob Zombie would be re-imagining John Carpenterfs slasher classic Halloween, critics and horror fans alike have been picking sides, alternately at arms over what they saw as a modern travesty and supportive of Zombiefs ability to recreate and update the thrills of what many consider the original slasher flick (though Black Christmas - recently reworked for 2006fs Black Xmas - appeared in Canada over four years earlier than the original Halloween).The film's release in late August did little to quell the controversy: critics panned it and audiences showed up in droves to push the film to a record-breaking Labor Day weekend opening. Regardless of critics words and filmgoers money, though, where does Rob Zombie's Halloween stand in the annals of horror movie history? After viewing the unrated directorfs cut of the film, along with a second disc packed full of special features, it's not a clear cut (no pun intended) victory for either side. If anything is clear, it's what Zombie attempted to do with his re-imagining: 1. Propel his film career forward by exposing himself to a wider fanbase, and 2. Attempt to psychologically deconstruct one of American horrorfs most infamous killers. Itfs obvious from the film's box office numbers that Zombie accomplished his first goal, but the second goal is a little more difficult to assess.Opening in 1978 (a clever nod to the year the original film came out), the audience witnesses a young Michael Myers (eeriely portrayed by young Daeg Faerch) navigating his way through an abusive household, getting bullied by older kids at school, and being neglected by his stripper mother (played by Zombiefs own wife Sheri Moon Zombie). Though the opening scenes are raw and gritty - Zombies specialty - the foulness and crassness of the Myers household actually begins to take away from the assertion that Michael Myers, like Damien from The Omen, was simply born disturbed and evil. The incessant ranting by his motherfs boyfriend, and the older punks at school may serve as worthy impetuses for Michaelfs repressed violent nature and help explain his desire to hide behind a mask, but ultimately this takes away from the simple horror of a psychotic killer arising from a typical, run-of-the-mill household.As Michael tortures and kills his pet rats, itfs clear Zombie is drawing on real serial killer history (animal torture is an early sign of sociopathy).  The reworking of the initial murder scene from the first Halloween is also strikingly impressive. In fact, for the first hour of the film, as Zombie's Myers unfolds before a bewildered audience, it starts to feel as if Zombie may have done the unthinkable and successfully created a back story that both evokes the original and adds new haunting layers to it. Malcolm McDowellfs intense Dr. Loomis provides a credible foil to Myersf silent stoicism, and playing on the mask theme works in Zombie's favor as little Michael quietly tells his mother that the mask hides [his] ugliness.Unfortunately, once the inevitable fast-forward 15 years occurs and an older Michael Myers is accidentally let free of his sanitarium cell (in one of the most overly and unnecessarily perverse scenes in recent history) all hell breaks loose - both on and off screen. Michael sets off on his rampage of violence and Zombie's screenwriting prowess is tested beyond its breaking point. As anyone who saw The Devil's Rejects knows, Zombie is somewhat of a master at the disturbing, the subversive, and the grotesque, but when it comes to writing dialogue for suburban families and teenie bopper girlfriends, Zombie is out of his element, and his film suffers for it. Rather than continuing along the semi-realistic slant he had been following, suddenly Zombie begins to flounder. The conversations are stilted and unnatural and no character manages to evoke even a hint of redeeming qualities.Meanwhile, Myers roams the street in broad daylight, with nary a frightened pedestrian in sight. This concept may have worked if Myers were of normal stature, but the casting of the 6' 8"" WCW star Tyler Mane as Myers makes his bemasked public appearances on quiet suburban sidewalks a little too imposing to go unnoticed. That's not to say that Mane's portrayal of the masked killer is at all faulty. His hulking physical presence and vacant stares provide more than enough chills to go around. But by the same token, those same qualities almost demand that Myers remain in the shadows as he did in the original.Scout Taylor-Compton has little to offer as Myers' sole surviving relative Laurie Strode. A few painful scenes as a babysitter and some even more painful screaming and crying will leave audiences feeling more pain than perhaps Laurie herself feels. The fact that she can never find her way out of a mess and insists on constantly running up stairs does little to endear her to audiences. In fact, she made such a minimal impression in Zombie's original script that he changed the ending to ensure that she grew as a character. (The original ending is included in the special features).Zombie's film does up the gore factor considerably, and the nudity factor as well. These unneeded additions could be nods to the unillustrious history of the horror/slasher film, or they could just be softballs to a built in audience Zombie is seeking to connect with; either way they're taken straight out of the Horror 101 handbook. Still, this 2007 Halloween towers over the recent glut of horror classic remakes that have hit theatres: The Omen, The Amityville Horror, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Fog, House of Wax, The Hitcher, Black Christmas, The Wicker Manc etc. Only The Hills Have Eyes and Halloween have had the audacity to do more than simply remake the originals with glossier film. Instead these films have taken the original concepts and expanded on them for a new generation of viewers.While Rob Zombie's Halloween has done nothing to tarnish his name, it's also done nothing to improve upon his filmmaking cred. Perhaps the leap from House of 1000 Corpses to The Devil's Rejects was so vast that audiences should have expected a bit of levelling out with his newest film, but here's hoping he'll continue to push the envelope that he opened with his impressively unique and startlingly dark foray into the world of film.The second disc of special features is exceptionally broad, and even includes a six minute blooper reel (mainly featuring Malcom McDowell's superbly un-PC riffs). A breakdown of the mask construction and a discussion with director Rob Zombie on his re-imagining offer a good deal of information for anyone interestd. The deleted scenes are here, but of course itfs clear that theyfve been deleted for a reason.  There's a brief breakdown of the entire cast, as well as clips from casting sessions. Much like the film itself, this special features disc leaves little to the viewer's imagination, but if you don't want to know, don't watch it.",3,"Packs a good punch, but doesn't quite go for the
