Why would Danny go to thugs resulting in bad Judgement again. However I would not have given anyone a job for doing nothing. Why couldn't the the Gang leader want to better someone in his family and that be a positive on the show.All Black People are not thugs and some who are want their siblings to become ligit. College Educated,Lawyers,Doctors,Educators. Danny getting his butt kicked as a trade off for a favor BS. Big Ed. should not have bugged their home but since Danny made a poor decision that would be the result.Glad Mary's Dad was whacked all child molestors should be. also the nagging wife of Ed's that should have been written out.
