61732,A3CGVO10F7NPMJ,0783229364,A Customer,"[13, 13]","1987's 'The Secret of my Success' was looked at by producers and possibly Mike himself as just another way to keep himself busy and broaden his fame while in the 'Family Ties' era. But 'The Secret of My Success' exploded when Michael J. Fox's talent wasnt the sole shining star of the movie..providing a great supporting cast of huge actors like Maggie Whitton, who played Fox's sensuous aunt Vera. Michael J. Fox comes to New York from a small country farm where his parents live, to give a familiar story of determination to succeed in a city that still rings true: &quot;If I Can Make It There.....&quot; Fox gets one foot in the door of a major corporation when his jerk uncle Howard Prescott decides to hire him in the mail room. The movie is perfect for Mike, whos' tremendous acting talent lends itself well to a young boy who works his way up the ladder of a multi-national corporation headed by a creep, and on the verge of overturning. I make it sound too dark though...the movie is non-stop laughs and an uplifting story that really does put a permanant smile on your face. Along with the greatest soundtrack Ive ever heard, which if youre buying this movie you HAVE to get the CD too, with all original songs and scores by performers like Pat Benatar, Night Ranger, David Foster, and Restless Heart. I can tell you right now if you've ever watched an episode of 'Family Ties', ever saw 'Back To the Future' 5 or 6 times in the last 4 years on tv or loved Fox's reign on 'Spin City'...this movie is perfect for you. A fast-paced, hilarious, energetic and cheerful movie that's great for the whole family.

Yet this light-as-a-feather Michael J. Fox comedy is still worth a gander, if only for the ribald humor dripping with double entendres--and some slapstick thrown in for good measure.  Fox pulls all of it off without breaking a sweat, and he's the motor that makes this comedy go.Playing a Kansas hayseed wanting to make a name for himself in the Big Apple, Fox's character gets hired by his egomaniacal uncle (Richard Jordan) to work in the mailroom of uncle's Fortune 500 corporation--a corporation fighting off a hostile takeover.  Dissatisfied with his lowly mailroom status, Fox takes up residence in a deserted office and pretends to be an executive (a ""suit""), causing a sensation in the upper echelons of the corporate hierarchy, and garnering the affections of a certain young female executive (Helen Slater)--who also happens to be having an affair with the uncle.  There are several other layers to the plot, but suffice it to say there is a bedroom-swapping ""Gotcha!"" moment, followed by an over-the-top feel good ending.  And the limo rides off into the sunset.Again, Fox is at his forte here, but this movie really gels because of its supporting cast, including a hysterical Margaret Whitton playing Fox's man-hungry aunt, Jordan himself, and Gerry Bamman as a brown-nosing ""yes"" man.  Unfortunately, Slater is the weak link, but Fred Gwynne makes a strong cameo as a ruthless corporate raider.

Fox in the prime of his career, really drives this film, and makes it as enjoyable as it could possibly get.  I doubt any other actor of the time could have pulled this one off.  He plays someone trying to be the yuppie that Alex P. Keaton strived to be in the hit TV show Family Ties.2. Excellent supporting cast: Robert Jordan and Margaret Whitton as Fox's uncle and aunt by marriage; and a good sidekick: John Pankow (Ira in TV's Mad About You) as Fox's mailroom, lowest on the office totem pole counterpart, who played off Fox very well.  I did find Helen Slater to be a little cold.3. Euro chic cinematography: With Carlo Di Palma (Blow-Up, The Appointment, Hannah & Her Sisters) on board, the look of this film was several notches above other similar films of the timeframe.  Just look at some of the interesting shots in the film, including a scene where you see Robert Jordan in the mirror of a restaurant, while he's talking to Helen Slater with his back to the camera.  Little stylish elements like this really make it an enjoyable rewatch in the present day.This one never went overboard with the sexual antics, and remained very innocent compared to the huge lot of other 80's R-rated romps.  It was also a few years ahead of just about every other teen film of the day, and I mean it in the sense that everyone else was in High School, while here we have a young man's journey on a career path after college.  This would also make it appealing to young adults who were otherwise too old for the John Hughes type movies.The DVD is definitely worth adding to your 80's film collection, especially considering it's low price.  The extras are the trailer, cast bios, and some production notes.  Presentation is widscreen and the picture quality is high.Some say it was very contrived, and I can't dispute that, but surely you can't overlook the entertainment value of this rather unique, yuppie, 80's gem.

Some 90 m.  movies feel like three hours and vice versa.  Secret of My Success feels like a half an hour.  That's pretty good.Brantley moves from Kansas to NYC in order to make it in the corporate world.  Problem: he gets laid off even before he starts.  He's a trooper, though, and doesn't want to run home with his tail between his legs so he goes to his Uncle Howard for a job.  It's not exactly what Brantley envisioned as he is stuck in the mailroom.  Using corporate bureaucracy  against itself, he manages to swing a job as a vice-president.  It gets pretty funny from there as Brantley tries to maintain two identities without being found out.  The elevator scenes are priceless!This movie is the definitive eighties comedy.  Michael J. Fox gets to showcase his screwball comedy antics and the rest of the cast is equally fine.  Helen Slater stands out as a female executive that manages to break through the glass ceiling only to be pressed up against it and fondled by the smarmy CEO.  ""Auntie Vera"" is also a hoot as the sex-starved wife of Uncle Howard.The DVD doesn't offer too much in the way of extras, but that's okay because the movie alone is worth having on disc.

61756,A12WZTC4YJ8ZEC,0783229364,Ethan D Van Vorst,"[0, 0]","I remember when this movie came out in the late 1980's. Michael J. Fox was one of the iconic actors of that decade, famous for his portrayals as the stuffy but endearing Alex P. Keaton on TV's ""Family Ties"", as well as the in-over-his-head teen caught up in a time-travelling nightmare in ""Back to the Future"". It's safe to say that just about anything Michael J. Fox touched in this era was all but guaranteed gold. And there's nothing wrong with that. The kid always came across as a genuine article likeable guy, all-American, with a real penchant for bringing out belly laughs. And I think this is what made ""The Secret of My Success"" so ""successful"" during it's theatrical run, because viewed two decades later with all of this in it's proper context, the movie is cute but long in the tooth and really just not *that* funny. Spoilers ahead! Consider yourself warned!Fox portrays Brantley Foster, an idealistic small town college graduate from Kansas determined to move to NY City and make it big in the business world. Upon finding himself in the Big Apple the job he had lined up has been suddenly and unexpectedly axed, leading Foster into unemployment. He runs through the motions of trying to find another job until, desperate, he eventually goes to his distant uncle, Howard Prescott (played by the ever fantastic Richard Jordan), who just so happens to be CEO of a major company in NYC, for a job. After an impassioned speech to Prescott, Foster is given a job in the mailroom, where he befriends coworker Fred (John Pankow from ""To Live and Die in LA"") and comes under immediate suspicion from the mailroom boss. Pankow shows him the ropes and eventually Foster sees Christy Wills (played by ""Supergirl"" Helen Slater) in one of the most ridiculous water-fountain drinking sequences I have ever been subjected to. I know it's the whole ""love at first sight thing"", but really folks...it's just a water fountain! *rolls eyes*The plot thickens when Foster ends up doing a one day limo service for an executive's wife, Vera (Margaret Whitton from ""Major League""), and after some awkward back and forth, she seduces him and, as the Bible puts it, he ""knows"" her. He discovers five minutes afterwards that it turns out Vera is Prescott's wife, making her Foster's aunt. Follow all that? :)Bear in mind we haven't even really touched upon the main theme of the film, namely what makes the ""Secret"" so ""Successful"", which basically involves Foster getting uppity and hijacking an empty office space for himself and taking on the role of an executive without anyone knowing it's all a sham.The movie has some truly funny moments (Foster's constant costume changing in the elevator is hilarious) but even Fox's charisma can't carry this film all the way through and after a while it turns into a series of mediocre slapstick moments tacked on to each other. The ""room switching"" scene in Prescott's mansion towards the end of the film exemplifies the problem. Here's a scene in which all the principals are trying to sneak off to various rooms to get their thing on with the other principals while simultaneously trying to not be seen en route there. It was a scene that was rife with comedic potential and it was squandered by poor pacing, lousy camera angles, unfunny slapstick, and very extended overuse of ""Oh Yeah"" by Yello (made famous by ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". Oh Yeaaaah *bow bow chick...chicka chicka*), a song which is cool in small amounts but gratingly annoying when one is forced to endure it for several minutes at a time.On a personal note I found it rather hypocritical of Foster to go around accusing Prescott of cheating on his wife when Foster was ""knowing"" her himself. He goes to Prescott at the beginning of the movie, who gives him a chance in his company when he didn't *have* to (this is key), and yet Foster ultimately pays him back by getting him fired? I would say that capitalism works out its own bugs without interference from outside forces but this just came across as a little to ""personal"" to me, and I felt that Foster simply did not have the proper motives for such animosity towards his benefactor (although Vera admittedly did). In fact, considering that Foster's  ""success"" was based entirely upon fraud I would think that there should have been at least *some* minor penalty for him. Instead he gets the CEO job, the girl, and does it all pretty dishonestly. Perhaps I make too much of it, but it deeply bothered me that I had seen it happen and with no consequence. I know...I know...it's just a movie. :P""Secret"" was, to me, a fairly mediocre movie, filled with 80's synthesizer music (and a whole pile of ""Oh Yeah"" by Yello), occasionally funny moments, and the ever likeable Michael J. Fox. It's certainly worth of a rental but this is not one that I'll be rushing forward to put in my DVD collection anytime soon. It feels overlong for what it is and probably could have been condensed into a much shorter movie with much better effect.",3,Your secret is safe with me,1239148800,"04 8,

61758,AY12DBB0U420B,0783229364,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain-rack DVD movie was ""The Secret of My Success"" starring Michael J. Fox. In the movie, Fox traveled from Kansas to New York City to make his success and fortune. He stumbled along the way and ended up with a mailroom job (thanks to his long-lost Uncle and CEO) at a major corporation. I can relate to that as I used to have a mailroom job, but I didn't have such an uncle. In any case, it soon got somewhat more hard to believe in that he became a self-motivated corporate freelancer and set up his domain in a vacant office and managed to procure loads of supplies and his own secretary. He also met Helen Slater, a lower-level corporate executive and Harvard graduate,  and was smitten. That's understandable, the smitten part. Then things started to get wild. Too wild, really. The early part of the movie introduced the characters and it was rather interesting. I was looking forward to settling in to a good comedy. The latter part of the movie decayed into a farce.Fox got seduced by the bosses wife (remember, the boss was his uncle) and his boss seduced his new-found and potential girlfriend (Slater), an employee. Things started to get complicated. Real complicated. Eventually, everyone attended  a large company gathering. Seducers and seducees are totally intermingled. Oh, I forgot. The boss thought  his nephew was a mail-room employee, as he was hired, and had no idea that he was a self-appointed corporate executive going under a different name and had somehow risen into the upper corporate ranks. The whole thing was a total fiasco and probably most people would find it to be hilariously funny. I didn't. The more complex it became, the more tedious it became. Toward the end, I just wanted to turn the whole farce off.Gary Peterson",3,Started Fun and Graduated to Tedium.,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,1772,"['Last', 'night', 'bargain-rack', 'DVD', 'movie', 'was', 'Secret', 'My', 'Success', 'starring', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'movie', 'Fox', 'traveled', 'Kansas', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'make', 'success', 'fortune', 'stumbled', 'along', 'way', 'ended', 'up', 'mailroom', 'job', 'thanks', 'long-lost', 'Uncle', 'CEO', 'major', 'corporation', 'can', 'relate', 'used', 'have', 'mailroom', 'job', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'uncle', 'case', 'soon', 'got', 'somewhat', 'more', 'hard', 'believe', 'became', 'self-motivated', 'corporate', 'freelancer', 'set', 'up', 'domain', 'vacant', 'office', 'managed', 'procure', 'loads', 'supplies', 'own', 'secretary', 'also', 'met', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'lower-level', 'corporate', 'executive', 'Harvard', 'graduate', 'was', 'smitten', 'understandable', 'smitten', 'part', 'Then', 'things', 'started', 'get', 'wild', 'Too', 'wild', 'really', 'early', 'part', 'movie', 'introduced', 'characters', 'was', 'rather', 'interesting', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'settling', 'good', 'comedy', 'latter', 'part', 'movie', 'decayed', 'farce.Fox', 'got', 'seduced', 'bosses', 'wife', 'remember', 'boss', 'was', 'uncle', 'boss', 'seduced', 'new-found', 'potential', 'girlfriend', 'Slater', 'employee', 'Things', 'started', 'get', 'complicated', 'Real', 'complicated', 'Eventually', 'everyone', 'attended', 'large', 'company', 'gathering', 'Seducers', 'seducees', 'are', 'totally', 'intermingled', 'Oh', 'forgot', 'boss', 'thought', 'nephew', 'was', 'mail-room', 'employee', 'was', 'hired', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'self-appointed', 'corporate', 'executive', 'going', 'different', 'name', 'had', 'somehow', 'risen', 'upper', 'corporate', 'ranks', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'total', 'fiasco', 'probably', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'be', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'more', 'complex', 'became', 'more', 'tedious', 'became', 'end', 'just', 'wanted', 'turn', 'whole', 'farce', 'off.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

Fox's character gets a job because his uncle is the CEO of a major company.  Fox will repay this kindness by betraying his uncle at the end of the movie.  Fox's motivation for turning on his uncle?  That he had an affair with the girl Fox wants.  That Fox had an affair with HIS wife is not important, I guess.3.  Fox's character stalks Helen Slater almost instantly.  Before he knows her name or anything about her, he's following her around and fantasizing about a woman we later find out was hired for her economic genius (more about this in a moment.)  So she's an object, period.4.  Fox's character simply isn't interested in doing the job he was hired to.  Instead he spies on ""the suits,"" goes through their mail, and manipulates the system to get himself an office and a secretary he can order to get him supplies and Chinese food.  And then this Fresh out of College kid decides he knows much more than the people with years of business experience, and at no point is he ever proven wrong about anything (a moment of humility, like the one he experiences in ""Doc Hollywood"" when he realizes that the Old Country Doctor really does know his stuff, is badly needed here.  Doesn't happen.)5.  Fox's character is sexually harrassed by his aunt.  I mean, there's simply no other way to put it.  Was this kind of crap funny in the 1980s?6.  ""Brantley Foster"" is much, much smarter than Helen Slater, who only went to Harvard Business School and has worked at the company for a number of years.  No one has a problem with the portrayal of Slater's character as a dunce compared to the kid from the mailroom?In the end, ""Brantley Foster"" gets the girl, gets the job, gets the private jet, and puts his Uncle on the unemployment line.  This is a ""happy ending.""  All that's missing is the ""80s slow clap"" to wrap up this cliche-ridden pile of mucus.

61767,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,0783229364,"John ""MovieAddict""","[4, 4]","""The Secret of My Success"" owes all its minimal success to the casting of Michael J. Fox, one of the most likable screen presences in all of film history. In ""Back to the Future,"" he was the overwhelmed high schooler who accidentally traveled back in time to 1955 and had to find a way back. In ""Teen Wolf,"" he was the highschooler turned into a werewolf. In ""The Hard Way,"" one of the best cop-buddy films of all time, he was the eager-to-please Hollywood actor trying to do some good-natured research.All his roles fall back on the Sweet Guy persona. In ""The Secret of My Success,"" he plays Brantley, a Kansas boy who makes the big move to the Big Apple, where he lands a job at his uncle Howard's (Richard Jordan) firm. He gradually makes his way up the ladder as a mail boy, but his real break comes when he is mistaken for a higher-up and tries to woo hard-to-get girl Christy (Helen Slater), a beautiful co-worker of the company who buys Brantley's job position.Simple premise, but it becomes all the more entangled when Brantley has to run back and forth between different job positions, changing clothes in the elevator and getting in a heated affair with his uncle's wife (played by Margaret Whitton), the kind of lady who doesn't take no for an answer.The film's amorality is what struck me on multiple viewings. It sort of seems dirty and unclean -- Brantley's a farm boy but he's eager to get in a romance with his aunt. The casual sexuality of the film is what, ultimately, makes it sort of disturbing, and also sort of memorable, as odd as that may sound.Fox shines in the lead role, and with any other actor the film would simply fall flat on its face. And, to be honest, a film like this could never be made nowadays -- I can imagine Jim Carrey in such a role, but the outcome would be wholly different. The eighties were an entire generation of comedy unto themselves. A lot of people love the comedies from the eighties because so many were made with so little thought and yet a lot of heart, kind of like ""The Secret of My Success."" Its mediocrity is what drives it, amazingly, but also its heart, and so many comedies nowadays lack the heart of the comedies from the eighties.I come back to ""The Secret of My Success"" a lot, probably because I saw it on TV when I was younger and it's been in my head ever since. It's a routine film that's hardly recommendable, but I actually enjoy it a lot the more I watch it, and it has a kind of frenetic comedic energy that most of the films of the genre are lacking nowadays.The script, by Jim Cash nd Jack Epps Jr., seems as though it were one from an earlier decade. It has a delightful sweetness to it that's simply not unnoticeable.I understand how many would dislike this film. The critic Roger Ebert gave ""The Secret of My Success"" 1.5/4 stars upon its inital release in 1987. I can't say I wouldn't have, either, if I were in his shoes. But comedies, over time, sort of grow on you, and this is one of those cases.It's not as good as ""Back to the Future,"" or ""The Hard Way,"" but it's a lot like Fox's ""Teen Wolf"" (1985): fast-paced, extremely routine, cliched, flawed, and lots of fun.

Part of the reason is that most students have seen this film, so I am likely to get nods of recognition more than if I mention ""Battleship Potemkin"" or ""Citizen Kane."" This 1987 comedy tells the story of Brantley Foster (Michael J. Fox), who heads from his family's farm in Kansas to the Big Apple to put his business degree to use, but all he can get is a job in the mail room of a firm owned by a distant uncle (Richard Jordan).Brantley comes up with a short cut but there comes a moment when he has to step up to the plate and impress a group of potential investors with a brilliant idea. We see Brantley explain but his idea to an enthralled group of rich businessmen, but...WE HEAR NOTHING. The script by Jim Cash & Jack Epps, Jr. and AJ Carothers (""&"" does not mean the same thing as ""and"" in Hollywood) could not come up with anything good enough to carry the scene so they just turned up the music and figured if we had enjoyed the movie to that point and if we liked Michael J. Fox then we would just buy this and proceed to the happy ending.  We do like Fox and we proceed to the happy ending.However, contrast this scene with its counterpart in another familiar film, ""The Karate Kid.""  That would be the great scene where Mr. Miyagi explains to Daniel-san that ""sand the floor"" means a whole lot than he ever imagined. That is the sort of scene that makes an entire movie (and gets an actor an Oscar nomination), and ""The Secret of My Success"" has a big hole where that scene should be and it really bugs me that the writers could not come up with something that proved our hero deserved to be the hero.There are more holes in this film, which allow Brantley to create the persona of Carlton Whitfield, a young executive in a previous empty office (being in the mailroom has its advantages in such a scheme) and provide a fairy godmother in the person of his Aunt Vera (Margaret Whitton). Meanwhile, Brantley (or Whitfield, depending on your perspective), is interested in Christy Wills (Helen Slater), who is introduced in the most erotic display of drinking from a water fountain in the history of American cinema.This is Michael J. Fox's movie and his engaging performance forgives most of the film's faults in this mindless comedy (mindless in that you will like the film if you mind the holes in it less). Actually, I was amazed to really see how many stupid things happen in ""The Secret of My Succe$s,"" but I still like Fox's performance. If nothing else, this film is a reminder that Fox was a gifted physical comedien.

The situations are ludicrous and unlikely. However, this movie offers well-executed comedy that is highly entertaining.Michael J. Fox is Brantly Foster, a recent college graduate and the nephew of a business executive and his wife. Foster is intelligent and considers that Uncle Howard (Richard Jordan) might give him an opportunity in his company. A job in the mail room was not exactly the start that Foster had in mind.Foster realizes that in a corporation the size of his uncle's that it is easy to do things without anyone realizing what is happening. So Foster sets himself up as newly hired executive Carlton Whitfield. Most of the executives accept Whitfield for what he seems to be. Foster's only significant problems are keeping Uncle Howard from finding out that he is also Carlton Whitfield and keeping his mail room boss from learning that he is not always delivering mail when his boss thinks he should be.Foster/Whitfield soon encounters beautiful Christy Wills (Helen Slater), a young and highly intelligent executive, with whom he soon falls in love. Just as quickly he encounters Aunt Vera (Margaret Whitton) and has more than one amorous encounter, before and after finding out she is his aunt by marriage.With Foster impersonating an executive while working in the mail room, courting Christy, who, unbeknownst to him, is also involved with Uncle Howard, and avoiding Aunt Vera as much as possible, the comedic potential is high, and the movie delivers. Much of the comedy is borderline slapstick, but much of it is also situational.The highlight of this movie, as with many light comedies of the 80s, is the somewhat cliche happy ending in the face of apparent doom. While you know there has to be a happy ending somewhere, you have to be very attentive to catch the clues that suggest what the ending might be.This movie is one of my favorite 80s comedies. While some critics have treated it harshly, the movie is fun to watch over and over because the situations, while predictable, are well done. Michael J.

Fox, Margaret Whitton, Fred Gwynne and Helen Slater), comedy, romance, action, and a great soundtrack.Michael J. Fox plays Brantley Foster who lives on a farm with his parents in Kansas. Brantley looks to succeed and starts right at the top of the difficulty scale...Manhattan. You know the old saying, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. Same thing goes for teaching, within the suburbs they tell you to get expierence in the NYC schools first. But don't believe what you hear, it's definately not bad at all. Anyway, Brantley gets fired on the first day he reports to his job and follows that up with rejections when he applies for others. He then goes as a last resort to his Uncle Howard who is CEO of Pembroke. Brantley starts in the mailroom and cooks up a plan to reach as high as he can...so he can be able to fly back to his parents house in the corporate jet and be able to afford that lovely penthouse he has, just kidding. You have to see and ""hear"" his apartment for yourself. It's hillarious!Trouble arises: Enter Donald Davenport (Fred Gwynne) and a hostile company takeover. Brantley who goes by the name of Carlton Whitfield when he's a ""suit"" also finds the girl of his dreams in Christy (Helen Slater, who also is not related to Christian Slater FYI); a whiz kid on money matters. Brantley's boss in the mailroom is also suspecting something is up and have an evil eye on him. Carlton/Brantley also have to look out for Uncle Howard but his biggest challenge is to tame his Aunt Vera (Margaret Whitton from Major League) who has taken a 'special liking"" to him.All of this adds to tremendous laughs almost every minute. The ending at Uncle Howard's house is great fun and non-stop laughs along with that famous song (So beautiful--with the great sound effects) from Feris Bueller's Day Off (great movie also). The soundtrack includes Night Ranger's The Secret of My Success and Roger Daltrey's The Price of Love. If you like the music from the 80's, you'll like these songs as well as the soundtrack. It would be nice to have a DVD that has the soundtrack included. For example, the James Bond movies have the music video for that particular movie. Don't mind my minor knit-picking; this is a great movie and for anyone who enjoys comedies then this is a definate for your movie collection.To sum it up, can Carlton/Brantley outwit his Uncle Howard, tame the wild beast aka his Aunt, and make it to the top?",5,"""The Sexual Revolution is over, everyone out of bed!!!""",1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,2555,"['one', 'favorite', '80', 'movies', 'amongist', 'others', 'great', 'actors', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Margaret', 'Whitton', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'comedy', 'romance', 'action', 'great', 'soundtrack.Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Brantley', 'Foster', 'who', 'farm', 'parents', 'Kansas', 'Brantley', 'succeed', 'starts', 'right', 'top', 'difficulty', 'scale', 'Manhattan', 'know', 'old', 'saying', 'can', 'make', 'here', 'can', 'make', 'anywhere', 'Same', 'thing', 'teaching', 'suburbs', 'tell', 'get', 'expierence', 'NYC', 'schools', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'hear', 'definately', 'not', 'bad', 'Anyway', 'Brantley', 'fired', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'up', 'rejections', 'when', 'others', 'then', 'last', 'resort', 'Uncle', 'Howard', 'who', 'CEO', 'Pembroke', 'Brantley', 'mailroom', 'up', 'plan', 'reach', 'as', 'high', 'can', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'able', 'fly', 'back', 'parents', 'house', 'corporate', 'jet', 'be', 'able', 'afford', 'lovely', 'penthouse', 'just', 'kidding', 'have', 'see', 'hear', 'apartment', 'hillarious', 'Trouble', 'arises', 'Enter', 'Donald', 'Davenport', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'hostile', 'company', 'takeover', 'Brantley', 'who', 'name', 'Carlton', 'Whitfield', 'when', 'suit', 'also', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Christy', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'who', 'also', 'not', 'related', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'FYI', 'whiz', 'kid', 'money', 'matters', 'Brantley', 'boss', 'mailroom', 'also', 'suspecting', 'something', 'up', 'have', 'evil', 'eye', 'Carlton/Brantley', 'also', 'have', 'look', 'out', 'Uncle', 'Howard', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'tame', 'Aunt', 'Vera', 'Margaret', 'Whitton', 'Major', 'League', 'who', 'taken', ""'special"", 'liking', 'him.All', 'tremendous', 'laughs', 'almost', 'minute', 'ending', 'Uncle', 'Howard', 'house', 'great', 'fun', 'non-stop', 'laughs', 'famous', 'song', 'So', 'beautiful', 'great', 'sound', 'effects', 'Feris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'great', 'movie', 'also', 'soundtrack', 'Night', 'Ranger', 'Secret', 'My', 'Success', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'Price', 'Love', 'like', 'music', '80', ""'ll"", 'like', 'songs', 'as', 'well', 'soundtrack', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'DVD', 'soundtrack', 'included', 'example', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'have', 'music', 'video', 'particular', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'minor', 'knit-picking', 'great', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'comedies', 'then', 'definate', 'movie', 'collection.To', 'sum', 'up', 'can', 'Carlton/Brantley', 'outwit', 'Uncle', 'Howard', 'wild', 'beast', 'Aunt', 'make', 'top']",N/A

It was a natural transition from his role as the stiff necked Alex Keaton on Family Ties that he would grow up and become a yuppie.  It was the roaring 80s, and New York had become a yuppie metropolis.Michael J Fox plays Brantley, a fresh faced Kansas farmboy who has come to the big city to seek his fortune.  Getting a tip from his parents that his uncle in a bigwig at a corporation in New York, he hopes to get a job there.  His uncle barely acknowledges him and gives him a job in the mailroom.  His dreams are squelched of having a suit, a fancy car, and a yuppie lifestyle.  While working in the mailroom, Brantley starts to fish through the company mail and reads their memos.  Deciding that he has something to say and can make a difference, he adopts a new persona of Carter, simply dresses like ""A Suit"", and gives himself a job there to change things.  Couple that with some smutty humor, trying to lead a double life without certain people finding out, and toppling corporate greeds and it was quite appealing.His Aunt Vera's lust for him wasn't very hot.  She was more like a shark in how she pounced on him at every opportunity.  Helen Slater, post Supergirl, plays a stiff Suit who is also trying to claw her way to the top.  While she is fridged and formidable towards Brantley's advances, she is having an affair with the boss / Brantley's uncle.  It makes for a bunch of near misses and smutty humor.This was probably the funniest yuppie movie I'd ever seen.  The main characters while trying to present a professional appearence and be good at their jobs, are actually sneaky, void of morals to be having affairs with other people's spouses, and ousting the capitalist pigs of the upper tiers of the company.  But they don't replace them with people who are more concerned about corporate ethics and doing good things for the people, they replace them with themselves.  They stop having their affairs, divorce their spouses and run off with the people they're having their affairs with.  When Brantley is found out he doesn't apologize for leading a double life, he only afirms how much smarter and more crafty he was than everyone else to have pulled this stunt.  He was a lovable yuppie scum.",4,Die Yuppie Scum was never so appealing,1130371200,"10 27, 2005",2005,2352,"['Fresh', 'success', 'first', 'Back', 'Future', 'movie', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'had', 'slot', 'film', 'history', 'starring', 'movies', 'yuppies', 'was', 'natural', 'transition', 'role', 'stiff', 'necked', 'Alex', 'Keaton', 'Family', 'Ties', 'would', 'grow', 'up', 'become', 'yuppie', 'was', 'roaring', '80s', 'New', 'York', 'had', 'become', 'yuppie', 'metropolis.Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Brantley', 'fresh', 'faced', 'Kansas', 'farmboy', 'who', 'come', 'big', 'city', 'seek', 'fortune', 'Getting', 'tip', 'parents', 'uncle', 'bigwig', 'corporation', 'New', 'York', 'get', 'job', 'there', 'uncle', 'barely', 'job', 'mailroom', 'dreams', 'are', 'squelched', 'having', 'suit', 'fancy', 'car', 'yuppie', 'lifestyle', 'working', 'mailroom', 'Brantley', 'fish', 'company', 'mail', 'reads', 'memos', 'Deciding', 'something', 'say', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'new', 'persona', 'Carter', 'simply', 'Suit', 'job', 'there', 'change', 'things', 'Couple', 'smutty', 'humor', 'trying', 'lead', 'double', 'life', 'certain', 'people', 'finding', 'out', 'toppling', 'corporate', 'greeds', 'was', 'quite', 'appealing.His', 'Aunt', 'Vera', 'lust', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'hot', 'was', 'more', 'shark', 'how', 'pounced', 'opportunity', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'post', 'Supergirl', 'stiff', 'Suit', 'who', 'also', 'trying', 'claw', 'way', 'top', 'fridged', 'formidable', 'towards', 'Brantley', 'advances', 'having', 'affair', 'boss', '/', 'Brantley', 'uncle', 'bunch', 'near', 'misses', 'smutty', 'humor.This', 'was', 'probably', 'funniest', 'yuppie', 'movie', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'main', 'characters', 'trying', 'present', 'professional', 'appearence', 'be', 'good', 'jobs', 'are', 'actually', 'sneaky', 'void', 'morals', 'be', 'having', 'affairs', 'other', 'people', 'spouses', 'ousting', 'capitalist', 'pigs', 'upper', 'tiers', 'company', 'do', ""n't"", 'replace', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'corporate', 'ethics', 'doing', 'good', 'things', 'people', 'replace', 'stop', 'having', 'affairs', 'divorce', 'spouses', 'run', 'off', 'people', ""'re"", 'having', 'affairs', 'When', 'Brantley', 'found', ""n't"", 'apologize', 'leading', 'double', 'life', 'only', 'how', 'much', 'smarter', 'more', 'crafty', 'was', 'everyone', 'else', 'have', 'pulled', 'stunt', 'was', 'lovable', 'yuppie', 'scum']",N/A

This movie is a nice, light-hearted contrast to those movies.  It centers around a young college graduate (played by the ever-talented Michael J. Fox) who realizes that he can't break into the corporate world by starting at the bottom, and so masquerades as a high-level executive in order to get his foot in the door.  He comes very close to pulling this off, owing in no small part to the incompetence of many of his fellow executives (especially the CEO and his ""enforcer"").

First, I will say that this movie DOES NOT hide behind effects or excessive obscenities. Nor does it try to force feed us any politics. Well, let me start on the film's merits. Fox's first bit of ill fortune is dramatic BUT plausible. (Good!) His desperate run to his distant uncle is drawn well. Although he does not really state his frustraion at the job he manages to get, we can clearly see it. (Great!) The company is drawn well. To put this in civil language, the certain breeches of sacramental promises, the favors given of a PG 13 nature for promotions on the job, the suits who have the childish  'I'm going to tell' attitude, the suits who can never figure out what to do, and the rare suits like Davis who try to be honest and do their job right, all give us a very realistic picture of this kind of environment. The mail room is also drawn very well. Mel and Fox's boss are very well drawn! I was in a situation once where the workers on the low  end of the scale clearly had a higher sense of awareness of what was going on. There were the very few Davises (the more honest and honorable suits), but most of the suits did not fall into this category. Mel clearly shows us someone who has little if anything to lose; so he does not delude himself into going along with the present politics of the environment; he is aware of what goes on; he is cautious to avoid interaction with people better avoided; and his loyalty to Fox is clearly drawn. Fox's boss is also very well drawn. Unlike the suits in charge, he is not smooth. Rather he is quite loud. Somehow, we are given the impression that he is on the intelligent side. At one point, he displays understandable frustration at the suits: 'This is a messenger service! Not a car service!&quot; I DO NOT think it was an accident that this is the character who was the FIRST one to stumble across finding Fox's double game. I don't want to ruin the ending for those of you who have not seen it. So I will just say, it is a memorable fight between politics and reality. Chances are, you will never find this movie boring. The scenery may not be Franco Zeffirelli's, but it is surprisingly well done.

The script is thus obviously doozy and relies on some major implausible situational gaffes, but the energy of Michael Fox and the brilliant comic timing of Margaret Whitton as his aunt makes it all borderline credible.  Plus, the snappy final half hour is the best part of the film, with some thoughtful romance thrown in for good measure. I guess we all have a hint of Bradley (Fox' character) buried in ourselves.

When his uncle (Richard Jordan) gives him a mail-room job in the high-rise headquarters of a major corporation, Fox occupies an empty office and poses as a young executive, winning the attention of a lovely young colleague (Helen Slater) and having an affair with who unfortunately turns out to be his boss's wife (Margaret Whitton).Sporadically amusing as a yuppie comedy and rather off-putting as a wannabe sex farce, the movie's still recommendable for its lively cast and a breezy style that almost succeeds in updating the conventions of vintage screwball comedy. Whitton is a standout performer here, so you may wonder why her comedic talent has been underrated, apart from a good role in the first 2 Major League movies.This comedy/drama flick may be little more than a big-screen sitcom, but it's not without its charms, plus it takes me back to memory lane to when I was 14 years old in the 8th grade during its theatrical release in the Spring of 1987 when Michael J.
