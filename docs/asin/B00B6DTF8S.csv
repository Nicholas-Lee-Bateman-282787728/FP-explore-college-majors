1622474,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B00B6DTF8S,Christopher Engel,"[0, 0]","Watching this film is a very unsettling experience, very especially if you know immediately where Makoto's coming from, which can only be true if you've been there. I have, and given the weight of the subject matter, the film's carelessness and outright absurdity is especially difficult.The true problem of the film is that it does almost nothing to develop the central character, Makoto, or anyone around him, in any truly meaningful way. It's easy to get the idea that the entire point of the film is the unveiling of Makoto's world--his character, the characters around him, his family, and in essence, the idea that there's a lot more to Makoto's life than we are first led to initially believe.But, incredibly, this fails to happen. Makoto's world is, in fact, exactly what it seems. The great revelation then becomes somewhat unclear. The given, which you know from the start, is that The Soul (let's just call him that, the anonymous soul that inhabits Makoto's body for a time) has no memory of his own past life, and no knowledge whatsoever of Makoto's life.He's given a very brief rundown by his ""guide"" Pura-Pura (sp) of why it was that Makoto killed himself. You get a few very basic and unexplained facts: He has a crush on a girl who he had seen walking into a shady motel with a middle-aged guy, and he assumes she's prostituting herself, though no reason is given. His mother *was* having an affair, and no other details are given about that. It's quickly learned that Makoto is a leper at school, harshly ostracized and very much an isolate. The rest is to be determined in the rest of the film......or so you'd be inclined to think. This is why everything ends up falling apart by the time it touches all the bases: The Soul is pretty much dead-on in his initial generalizations and assumptions, or we don't really get the chance to see the realities of the lives of others.His crush is indeed prostituting herself, exactly as described. When pressed for a reason, she says it's so she can buy expensive things, ""like a girl should have.""Don't bother waiting for it. That's about all you learn. Her motivation is revealed in one encounter, and no other motivations are present. But I certainly had some questions after the encounter they have: What did she mean by ""like a girl should have""? According to whom? What is her home life like? Why does she either feel the need to resort to such measures, or lack the general moral idea that prostituting oneself for these things is personally demeaning? Why does she feel the need to have these things so badly? Who's judging her? If it's herself, for what reason does she believe that?But, like all the other questions brought up, that's it. What you see is all there is, according to the film. No deeper explanation really exists. Sure, she comes back at the end of the film with a glimmer of shame, but no actual exposition into why she is the way she is. The viewer, I'd imagine, is kind of owed at least that much. Same with his mother's affair, or his lack of friends, or the other non-existing details of his ""unluckiest day ever"".Even his suicide itself isn't really touched on. We're told, somewhat ostentatiously by Pura-Pura, that Makoto had at the very least a ""trigger"" that set him off enough to kill himself, or alternately, what, if anything, caused the impulse in him. One strangely empty reveal is that he used his mother's sleeping pills, nothing he himself was prescribed, to commit the act. Which even further asks the questions about his mother's involvement in everything, and why she was having an affair.But that's how everything in this film goes. According to the film, the ""why"" of everything is, at best, unimportant. What matters, apparently, is the kind-of-a-given-from-the-start notion that his life affects the lives of others around him, as well. This is hardly a revelation, as there's never any question that his family cares deeply for him and is sensitive to him, as well as a select few people at his school. The explanations, then, don't matter, and even the suicide itself doesn't matter, because now The Soul realizes he is in fact Makoto's soul itself, and for whatever reason, he didn't notice these things or just wasn't as lucky the first time around.He's seemingly truly saved, ultimately, by his making a friend from his class one day, by a chance meeting. This is really his biggest motivation to succeed in the future and his initial reason for wanting to live.Wait, but how does that work? He seemed to make his new friend as soon as he changed both his looks and his personality a bit, as well as buy a pair of nice sneakers. Apparently he was never friends with this guy in the past. But after he's done tailing his crush-prostitute, he appears once, and then appears later when Makoto is just wandering after he's mugged, and his sneakers are stolen. What was stopping him before? Not buying the sneakers to catch his initial interest? Not running into him when he's checking out some of the area's historical trolley routes?The lack of rhyme or reason behind it all just doesn't work, and the reasoning ultimately is surprisingly, and disappointingly, shallow. The other characters almost don't even matter, since it's apparently an internal change in Makoto's perspective about how he affects the world around him in a positive way. His crush? Explained away in a few sentences. The odd-one-out girl who is inspired by him? Well, if you can put past that he sexually assaults her at one point, that's about the end of it. Again, everything is really just as important as it seemed at the beginning.It's worth going into a separate part about the story, as it can't really get the idea of a very young suicide quite right, and suffers from an extreme over-simplification of things, one that it actually endorses. This is an abstract part of the review, because it has to do with the portrayal of Makoto's suicidal instinct, which just doesn't gel at all.The thing is, as soon as The Soul wakes up in Makoto's body, I was looking at a familiar scene. He's survived his suicide attempt, is recovering in a hospital, and his family is despondent and desperate.I've left a hospital at a young age for suicidal behavior, and known others (actually in junior-high, roughly the same age group as Makoto, really a total child) who have also had the same experience. Graciously, the film at least gets the most important aspect, that of the family's extreme sensitivity and dealing with his attempt, pretty straight. As I've known from both myself and others in the same situation, destroying your family's sense of your safety and mental well-being, as well as the idea that you could snap at any second, is intact. For the more fortunate among us with families that care in this way, that's just how it tends to play out. Everyone gets super-sensitive about everything you say and do, and they seemingly have no idea what to say, and they're scared to death of bringing up the topic of suicide.If the film gets anything right, it's this. What it doesn't get right, though, is Makoto's apparent ""reasons"" behind his suicide.Makoto has a melancholic temperament, no doubt. He's been traumatized by bullying, disillusioned by his crush's prostituting herself, and isn't very much interested in his future, being last in his class and facing the prospect of being placed in one of the worst private high schools (this is apparently a really, really big deal in Japanese culture, in which even the concept of possibly going to a public school is a mark of shame--less so in American culture, as I would think quite a few of us, including myself, spend their lives in state-funded public schools, and it may in its own way sort of suck, but it's generally not a mark of shame). He's blessed with his artistic skills, a creative outlet in which he can indulge (me, I do poetry, but they're fundamentally the same type of outlet). This is apparently not enough of an outlet for him, though, as evidenced by the fact that he's ultimately dead by suicide.But it's questionable that these are his reasons for suicide. I'm not saying you even need ""reasons"" to possibly explain a suicide, as there are often none that even the suicidal can identify. These are, however, stated as Makoto's reasons, but they're not really put in perspective at any point during the film. The film seems to suffer from what a lot of less-informed films about suicide (and homicide) tend to presume, which is that there is an identifiable ""reason"" for someone's suicide. Makoto's ""trigger"", at least, isn't really established well, as aforementioned by the problem that everything is as it seems, and his ""reasons"" aren't actually given much chance to establish themselves in a true-to-life, realistic context.Moreover, his life is literally explained to him by Pura-Pura. He learns a little bit about himself and his life, but this reminds me of the Back To The Future conundrum, in which the fact is that the main character is living in an alternate reality of which he has exceptionally little knowledge. Now, Makoto's a bit above that in that this is indeed an identical life (as The Soul is revealed to be Makoto's), but he starts in the same exact position. He does not, in fact, remember anything. Nothing whatsoever. He's left to discover on his own what Makoto's life is like, but his own memories are gone, so Makoto's memories aren't really his. It's sort of a minor problem with the film, but it's hard to miss. It's not stated that Makoto is going to get back all the memories he used to have before he died, leaving us to assume that he only kept what he's had up until that very point.Being close to suicide (and the suicidal), Makoto isn't portrayed very well as one. His motivations just aren't really given. This is kind of a problem when the film seems to surround it.And after all that, there's the film's rather insensitive and old-school attitude toward suicide. Makoto's soul is said to have committed a terrible sin--which is, in fact, the act of killing, though in this case, it's himself. You should already know where I'm going with this, unless you're an idiot.This film isn't *that* old, but its beliefs about suicide are downright archaic. I would think at least the film would have the grace to not treat suicide as a voluntary act, and especially not a ""sin"", and more especially, not the equivalent of murder (much older societies did in fact believe this, however, and so treated the corpses of suicides the same way as murderers). I don't know about you, but in the school of suicide, it is taught above all that suicide is in no way a voluntary act, and no one actually *wants* to commit suicide. It's often an impulse, something the person saw as the single solution to their problems, best explained by the saying, ""I want to die, I just don't want to kill myself."" There is no such thing as someone who kills themselves because they want to or because of a personality that is somehow lacking (*all* are vulnerable to the phenomenon), no one who does so with hope, no one because of a personal fault, and hence is totally absent from the very concept of being a ""sin"", or an offense against God, or even remotely comparable to homicide. This is not so much a cultural difference as much as a horribly outdated attitude about suicide, one which most cultures, certainly post-modern ones, have gotten over and understood the idiocy of, Japanese modern culture notwithstanding. Those who commit suicide are not sinners and have committed no offense against God--as has been formally and finally established by two of the three Abrahamic religions, sans Islam--and that's the end of the discussion.A film that somehow has managed to sneak by the fact that its message is trivially demonstrated at the last minute, its initial major mysteries not properly explored to a meaningful extent, and we don't actually get to see what amounts to a truly promising future. The film ends without telling us what really happened, without telling us who Makoto really is, or who the people around him really are, or how his environment is truly like in any meaningful detail. It appears content that its stupid-simple explanations are enough and its message is above any believable reality, and that's its greatest failing. It makes Makoto's life seem shallow and trivial, and the circumstances within it are left unexplained.Sadly, this is a film that sells itself, but most especially its primary message and its own world, along with the entire concept of suicide, very, very short, and there's no way one can get around that. It's just totally unforgivable to depict reality as this simple, and to say the power of positive thinking is effective against the suicidal is just misguided, and totally incorrect. Its portrayal of the themes present is not only absurd and grossly oversimplified, but disturbingly archaic.",1,"Senseless, saccharine, grossly unrealistic, and most unforgivably, artificial and trite

1622481,A2SQ7D8UXD9YRN,B00B6DTF8S,"Mark A. Weiss ""mweiss_reason_man""","[8, 8]","I was browsing my wish list for what to buy next on Amazon when I spotted a listing for this film. I&#8217;d seen the listing before, but frankly, the cover design on the disc was somewhat odd and off-putting, so I didn't pay much attention until it came up again tonight and I decided to read the reviews. I learned that it was available on Hulu, so after reading all the reviews, I watched the film, online. On the spot, I decided to buy the Blu-ray disc. This becomes one of my favorite anime films, right up their with Umi ga Kikoeru and Omohide Poro Poro.A lot of the reviews are a bit misleading because the first half of the story makes you think that someone&#8217;s spirit is being injected into a stranger&#8217;s body, for &#8220;reformation&#8221;. That aspect is somewhat confusing at first, but becomes clear by the end of the film.For the non-religious viewer, it will take some suspension of disbelief to enjoy this film, because after all, it deals with the topic of afterlife. One has to put aside one&#8217;s philosophical ideas about it and just experience the story, live &#8220;in the moment&#8221; as you experience, first-hand, the life of Makoto Kobayashi.The film&#8217;s approach to a plot line is very unique. I must admit, I have not seen anything like this before&#8212;especially not in the anime genre. To my knowledge, the plot is innovative and unlike any other. The concept of a person&#8217;s soul, after death, passing through a sort of &#8220;clearing house&#8221; where souls get directed either to the &#8220;afterlife&#8221; or back into an earthly being&#8217;s body for another go-round, was intriguing and full of unexpected surprises.If &#8220;you&#8221; are not &#8220;you&#8221; anymore, during that after-death phase, and &#8220;you&#8221; are injected into a being on earth, you have no memories of your past, or whom &#8220;you&#8221; were in the prior life. That condition is what makes Makoto&#8217;s existence so full of surprising reactions, discoveries and is ultimately the &#8220;outside perspective&#8221; which gives him new insight into his life, who his family are and how everyone is inter-dependent on one another. It&#8217;s an ingenious plot mechanism and Director Keiichi Hara makes it all flow so smoothly and naturally.There are many moments that make the viewer feel &#8220;queasy&#8221; as Makoto&#8217;s character, in the early days of his &#8220;new&#8221; life, has a care-free, reckless attitude. His family are like strangers to him, and he simply treats the situation like some sort of curiosity, to be played with as it suits his enjoyment. Gradually, he discovers persons whom, at first, he admires, but then learns that these persons are corrupted, or flawed in ways he cannot accept and he becomes disillusioned and more despondent. But some of these people should normally play a minor role in one&#8217;s life and in the big scheme of things, he really has a pretty good life.I found myself getting angry at this kid&#8217;s attitude, because the situation that he was dropped into was a good one: well-off parents, a loving family, a nice place to live (the general vicinity of Tamagawa Prefecture) and all the things that any kid would be happy to have in life. Things weren't perfect, but I don&#8217;t think there exists a real-life &#8220;Brady Bunch&#8221; in reality&#8212;not even in Japan. In a way, this film was an honest expos&eacute; of Japanese life. Not every marriage is perfect. Not every school girl is innocent. There are some shocking things going on in this film, but I suspect it&#8217;s a realistic snapshot of Japan.Something that becomes apparent in layers, as the film progresses, is that people who undergo &#8220;near death&#8221; experiences fundamentally change. Their whole sense of perspective changes, as was the case with Makoto. The people that he hangs out with, the activities he enjoys, etc., but in other respects, some things stay the same.On another level, this film is about the psychological devastation that adolescents can suffer from as a result of being the unpopular social outcast and being victimized by bullies. Those sufferings take center stage in Makoto&#8217;s former life and he completely ignores the good aspects of his life&#8212;like the wonderful family that cares for him. But his suicide attempt changes them too. And his return to the living gives them new hope, for a while, though Makoto&#8217;s indifference and uncaring attitude in the early days of his recovery hurt his family&#8212;especially his mother, deeply. There are signals here that something dreadful may happen. There is still one scene in the film which I don&#8217;t understand, and seems like a deleted scene that was not removed, because upon seeing it, I got the most dreaded fear of what was going to happen next.Overall, this is a somewhat bittersweet film, perhaps a few steps above bittersweet, but most of all, it makes us aware of how we are all interconnected and how our actions affect those we love and who love us.Although I watched for the first time through the pixelated, granular window of Hulu&#8217;s bitrate-limited video experience, I could tell that the animation and artwork in this film was at the top of the very best I've seen anywhere. The smoothness and fluidity, the foley work (sound effects) that added a sense of &#8220;being there&#8221;, and the beautiful cityscapes and environment that puts the viewer right into the neighborhood. The lighting and the dynamic range of the scenery in shade, sunlight, overcast and at night is the most realistic I have seen in anime. I can hardly wait for the Blu-ray of this film to arrive. I want to watch it on the big screen and really drink in the visual details&#8212;it&#8217;s that stunning.I don&#8217;t know why this film isn't more widely-known, because it&#8217;s probably one of the best anime films of all time. That is, if you overlook the fantastic notion of &#8220;afterlife&#8221; depicted here&#8212;which is the only supernatural phenomenon in the film. The rest is just a wonder &#8220;slice of life&#8221; story with a theme of self-discovery. So if one looks at the vehicle used to make the story have a meaningful context, I&#8217;d say that it&#8217;s a valid tool to use in fiction. I sometimes wonder if the writer is telling his own life story, because it&#8217;s so vivid and intense.&#8220;Colorful&#8221; is an absolute must-have for any fan of the Japanese anime genre. It IS right up there with anything out of Studio Ghibli, and I don&#8217;t say that lightly&#8212;I love and adore Miyazaki&#8217;s films, and this is simply testimony to how excellent a film this is. Buy it, go to a friend&#8217;s home theater, if you&#8217;re fortunate enough to know a videophile, and enjoy this on a big screen. This story will transcend your existence and leave you feeling raw emotions, but left for the better to have gained this valuable experience.",5,An Unexpected Delight&#8212;Probably the Best Anime

1622482,ANIEU8QC4MT9K,B00B6DTF8S,M. Lee,"[5, 5]","This movie really surprised me. It starts out very surreal and different; you are watching things from the main character's point of view, rather than looking at him, and you are welcomed into a sort of in-between place for souls to go before they move on after death. You are quickly stopped by a small boy who informs you that though you don't remember it, you have committed a terrible deed in your life and you are now given an opportunity to return to life in the body of another and redeem yourself. No, not just an opportunity - an order. This is a mandatory task. And so what can you do? You go.The story sort of sucks you in there. The main character is placed in another's body - the body of a boy called Makoto, who has recently committed suicide - and must learn what he can about the boy's life in the hopes that he will remember his own and reform. However, the trials and ugliness of Makoto's life soon depress him and he becomes almost nonchalant about his mission. The people he interacts with and the experiences he has are sometimes rather disturbing, at least for me personally. This film is not rated, and while I think it could get by with a PG because there is nothing explicit actually shown, I would venture to give it a PG-13 because of the mature issues it deals with. However, the beauty of the film is hardly lessoned by this content - rather it is strengthened. I always appreciate it when a film or book is honest about life, rather than making it appear all sunshine. Makoto would not have committed suicide if his life was perfect and clean. And so it isn't. Which makes the journeys of each of the characters, and mostly of the main character, far more real and meaningful.This movie is about finding the value of yourself, your life, and others. It is not a gentle story. But it is rewarding at the end.

This is absolutely for mature audiences as it deals with suicide but it also touches on classroom bullying and other themes regarding teenage behavior so it should be the parent's decision whether or not to let their pre-teen kids see it and there should be discussion afterwards.This touched me and I ended up crying for several minutes afterwards.  Very few movies whether live or animated have brought me to tears but over the years I've had two co-workers who lost their teenage children to suicide.  One to depression from bullying at school and the other to feelings of hopelessness due to suffering from traumatic brain injury so I'm sure that had a lot to do with the crying.In spite of the sadness this was a wonderful movie that's well worth watching.
