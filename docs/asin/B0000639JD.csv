694689,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0000639JD,Alfred Johnson,"[5, 6]","Arthur Miller had a good ear for the foibles and traumas of the ordinary people of the old middle class put up against the wall in a world that was dramatically changing after World War II. The time of the man in the gray flannel suit and the victory of corporate culture that destroyed the old independent professions was not Willie Loman's time. In this play, seemingly only about the trials and tribulations of Everyman Willie Loman a used up salesman at the end of his career, the underlying tension is that he cannot keep up with those changes and therefore has to be discarded. This has a fallout effect on his personal life as well. He does not understand what has happened to destroy the integrity of his dysfunctional nuclear family. The old standards that had guided him do not stand up in the new suburban-dominated world where he must try to survive. Obviously there is some dramatic tension between him and his sons who have in their own way nothing but contempt for the old man, his old ways, his illusions and his duplicity. But also, as is always the case with rebellious children, love, at least their conception of it, as well. That this is not good enough to save him in the end is one of the lessons to be learned from the play. Read the play and see the Lee J. Cobb version of the movie.

Cobb as Willy Loman in this David Susskind produced version is as close as possible to seeing the original play on Broadway, and a far sight better than just about any live production one could find nowadays.Mr. Cobb's performance is so absorbing, so powerful and so disturbing, that we, (the audience) feel genuinely dazed at its conclusion. It's as though, by the time of the final scene, that we too, are attending Willy's funeral, and all stumble away drained and awed.The supporting cast are each and all superb, with Mildred Dunnock probably topping anything else in which she has appeared. Set design is also inventive in its combination of abstract and realistic interiors and exteriors.As to the character of Willy, it is to Mr. Cobb's credit, that for all of his past moral compromises and shabby aspirations, the most honest of us, will admit that we recognize something of ourselves in him.Theater and television at its best!

694691,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,B0000639JD,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[55, 58]","If you want to see a production of one of American Theater's most important playwright's most important works, then look no further. Though there have been several noteworthy productions over the years, this Broadway Theater Archive treat showcases the &quot;perfect&quot; Salesman cast, in a treatment that is essentially a reblocking of the famed Elia Kazan Broadway premiere of the play. Willie Loman's originator, Lee J Cobb, reprises his role, along with Mildred Dunnock. Though Geroge C. Scott and Dustin Hoffman received critical acclaim for their interpretations of Willie Loman, neither holds a candle to Cobb. He simply &quot;is&quot; Willie. George Segal and John Malcovich weigh in about evenly in the &quot;best Biff&quot; category, but the nod goes to Segal, because of the great ensemble cast he was lucky enough to play off of. Yet another winner in a BTA series that chronicles American Theater in its greatest era (60's and 70s).Just a note to bear in mind that these plays are film versions of the plays exactly as they were staged on Broadway at the time, so don't look for cinematic production values. Sometimes the camera work is not ideal, but that doesn't get in the way of the consistently powerful performances, and that's what great theater is all about, anyway. I'm just grateful that most of the series is available and hope that the unavailable titles are just being restored and will be rereleased soon.BEK",5,Defines Definitive,1046304000,"02 27, 2003",2003,1437,"['want', 'see', 'production', 'one', 'American', 'Theater', 'most', 'important', 'playwright', 'most', 'important', 'works', 'then', 'look', 'further', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'noteworthy', 'productions', 'years', 'Broadway', 'Theater', 'Archive', 'treat', 'quot', 'perfect', 'quot', 'Salesman', 'cast', 'treatment', 'essentially', 'reblocking', 'famed', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Broadway', 'premiere', 'play', 'Willie', 'Loman', 'originator', 'Lee', 'J', 'Cobb', 'role', 'Mildred', 'Dunnock', 'Though', 'Geroge', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'received', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'interpretations', 'Willie', 'Loman', 'neither', 'candle', 'Cobb', 'simply', 'quot', 'quot', 'Willie', 'George', 'Segal', 'John', 'Malcovich', 'weigh', 'evenly', 'quot', 'best', 'Biff', 'quot', 'category', 'nod', 'Segal', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'play', 'off', 'winner', 'BTA', 'series', 'American', 'Theater', 'greatest', 'era', '60', '70s', '.Just', 'note', 'bear', 'mind', 'plays', 'are', 'film', 'versions', 'plays', 'exactly', 'were', 'staged', 'Broadway', 'time', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'cinematic', 'production', 'values', 'Sometimes', 'camera', 'work', 'not', 'ideal', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'consistently', 'powerful', 'performances', 'what', 'great', 'theater', 'about', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'just', 'grateful', 'most', 'series', 'available', 'hope', 'unavailable', 'titles', 'are', 'just', 'being', 'restored', 'will', 'be', 'rereleased', 'soon.BEK']",Death of a Salesman Broadway Theatre Archive  VHS

I had to read this play in an Existentialism class and 30 years later bought this DVD from Amazon. I have seen many others including Dustin Hoffman's version. His was not bad but can't compare to Lee J. Cobb. This story reminds me so much of my dad's life. Struggling to try and make a living with hopes and dreams never coming into fruition. I really think it is just as relevant today as when this version came out in 1966. Arthur Miller was a genius. It is hard to believe that a man who writes like that married Marilyn Monroe. This play/movie excels in portraying the characters properly. The music also gives a hint as to what is happening. This is a must see play.
