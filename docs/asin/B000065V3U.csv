I loved it mainly because I thought it was a true story, since I had turned it on after the first 15 minutes & missed the opening voice-over. (Just to clarify: five million Americans served in Vietnam over the course of that long war, therefore a good chance exists the events in this movie happened to thousands of young vets--so I'm hesitant to call it FICTIONAL)Watching it four years later, I felt very sad at the end. Which I actually DIDN'T feel the first time I saw it. The characters were both likeable & unlikeable; I love a movie where you can resent one character you've known all of two hours, or be on the verge of tears when another is facing a difficult time.Bob seemingly acknowledges his son has changed for the worse when he gives his ""draft card speech"" at the Thanksgiving day table, but he does nothing to help Jeremy. At the same time, Karen is a psych student, but she can be a little too harsh on Jeremy in certain moments. But the characters are humans, they make mistakes.The only real problem I had was with the ending voice-over. It gave too much away. I would have been happier wondering what became of Jeremy. (I wonder why they had Karen, of all the characters, doing the voice overs?)

Emilio Estevez is a son who returns from Vietnam and obviously has some real psychological problems and cannot reintegrate himself into society and definitely not into family life. His father tries to gloss over the problems and thinks Estevez can be ""normal"" again if only he will go out and get a job. Bates is totally oblivious and the overbearing and overprotective and overly sensitive mother. The story is actually fairly complex emotionally and is surprising considering that Emilio Estevez directed. Not a great movie, but not a bad one either. What can I say?

The writer delivers an unusual look at what can, and often does happen when the ""prodigal son"" returns from Vietnam. The actors,truly captured the essance of the turmoil and bring it to the screen with stark reality.  Martin Sheen as the Father, and Kathy Bates as the Mother excell in thier roles, and Emilio Estaves who also directs create an emotional crisis that wrench at the heart of the viewers. Thier powerful performance is only enhanced by the fact that they are Father and son in real life. Kathy Bates is ""annoying"" as the Mother who simply wont let her ""Son"" grow up upon his return...yet her performance is outstanding. The entire production brings the audience ""into"" thier home ... one becomes part of thier ""Family"" without realizing it.The timely ""flash backs"" of the war's actions are well done and allows the audience to see just where the turmoil begins without disturbing the central storyline.  There may be many who do not understand this turmoil but for those that do, this small and underated production is a must for everyone's video library. To those who understand,the ""War"" within the household  is far more devastating than the War at the front. The conclusion is the true reality of the piece and allows one to share the heart wrenching sadness that comes with the inablity to  cope.
