Classic after classic this is simply Steinman's masterpiece.However, when the Melbourne Symphony teamed with Meat Loaf something was lost.The orchestrations are sparse at best. Soaring treble-high strings is about all you can hear. With music containing the power of Steinman's instrumentation and composition and Meat's incredible voice I just wanted more power.Similar to Meat's double live album, ""Live Around the World"" the band and Meat sound great, full of energy and obviously they know these songs like the back of their hand, however the orchestra just does not sit well with most of the songs. With something like ""heaven can wait"" or ""Bat out of Hell"" I expected huge ripping brass, intense wind and string combinations, rolling timpani, and intricate orchestrations that supported Steinman's original band score. They simply are not here.The Melbourne as you may know, did a similar show with Kiss and I really felt the same way about that record. The Melbourne Symphony is great but they lack the power and drive of an ensemble such as the San Francisco Symphony...now them and Metallica....that's classical rock/metal!",2,Great idea....something's lost with the Orch,1204675200,"03 5, 2008",2008,1255,"['30', 'years', ""'re"", 'still', 'love', 'Original', 'Bat', 'album', 'damn', 'good', 'reason', 'simply', 'one', 'greatest', 'Classic', 'classic', 'simply', 'Steinman', 'masterpiece.However', 'when', 'Melbourne', 'Symphony', 'teamed', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'something', 'was', 'lost.The', 'orchestrations', 'are', 'sparse', 'best', 'Soaring', 'treble-high', 'strings', 'can', 'hear', 'music', 'containing', 'power', 'Steinman', 'instrumentation', 'composition', 'Meat', 'incredible', 'voice', 'just', 'wanted', 'more', 'power.Similar', 'Meat', 'double', 'live', 'album', 'Live', 'World', 'band', 'Meat', 'sound', 'great', 'full', 'energy', 'obviously', 'know', 'songs', 'back', 'hand', 'however', 'orchestra', 'just', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'most', 'songs', 'something', 'heaven', 'can', 'wait', 'Bat', 'Hell', 'expected', 'huge', 'ripping', 'brass', 'intense', 'wind', 'string', 'combinations', 'rolling', 'timpani', 'intricate', 'orchestrations', 'supported', 'Steinman', 'original', 'band', 'score', 'simply', 'are', 'not', 'here.The', 'Melbourne', 'may', 'know', 'did', 'similar', 'show', 'Kiss', 'really', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'record', 'Melbourne', 'Symphony', 'great', 'lack', 'power', 'drive', 'ensemble', 'such', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Symphony', 'now', 'Metallica', '.that', 'classical', 'rock/metal']",N/A

This is in 16:9and the band is great as is the Orchestra, and you will love the DTS encoding. But man, for the 'Bat out of Hell"" songs, he had a hell of a chance in hitting any note.  I saw someone say ""He can't sing"". Well, I am sure Bob Dylan would be kicked off ""American Idol"", or showing age, ""The Gong Show"", so that is an impression. Granted, he is not the greatest singer. Is Ozzy Osborne?  I love Black Sabbath music, and own a few of his/their DVD's.But honestly, he really ruined ""Paradise by the dashboard lights"" withhis pathetic drama and on-stage antics.  I don't care if people rate this up, down, or whatever. I don't have time to write reviews. But I am going to try the ""Bat out of Hell"" DVD. Had good ratings.  This DVD would be great if it only had the female vocals. What talent on that stage!  The disk is worth it just for that alone as an instrumental, if there was only a way to cut Meatloaf and his vocals from the track.  In the end the pathetic stage antics really ruined this DVD for me. :((",1,"Oh My God!

Every song was butchered, I watched it once, and never will again. I bought this DVD because I am looking for live performances of my favorite artists, and the reviews here on amazon raved about how good it was and how Meat Loafs vocals were at peak performance and the female singer did a great job.Not only was Meat Loaf singing monotone, but his stage presence was disturbing, He acted like he was mad at the audience throughout the concert. He tried to get them to pumped up, and got mad when they didn't. Who could, watching and listening to that poor excuse of a concert, I would have walked out!The concert theme was a male versions of a Britney Spears concert, A lot of outlandish glitz, but no substance. Every song was ruined, The female singers voice was OK but she didn't have any heart. Everything was all jazzed up, obviously trying to modernize the songs that could never be improved upon. I've heard garage bands that can blow away this sad performance.If you want to experience these songs the way they are suppose to be, buy Meat Loaf ""Hits Out Of Hell"" DVD, It's Great!

He's been performing for over 30 years and yet he really only has about three tangible hits to his career.  ""Two Out of Three Ain't Bad"" and ""Paradise By the Dashboard Light"" are his claim to fame.  Both from his one big album from 1977 called ""Bat Out of Hell"".  Perhaps even his later song ""I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)"" kept his name alive through the nineties.  But, he doesn't give up, does he?  He pushes his small contribution to rock music on his concerts and constantly finds ways to embellish what little he has to offer.  He's got a unique operatic approach to rock and roll.  Full blown orchestration, but with really cheesy lyrical content.  Many of his titles are based on silly phases but fully embellished with rock guitar and orchestra.  Somehow, I can't help but think that he must have something to do with Bonnie Tyler's music career.  Her lyrics sound like they were written by him as wellThis rather heavyset performer knows that he has to offer something more than just himself to pack in an audience.  So he performs ""larger than life"" on stage with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and also fills the stage with many scantily clad hot babes to keep the show rather sexy and exciting.  I enjoy fabricated ""babefests"" on film so this concert merits some appeal for me.I'd say that this show was pretty good.  It's better than I was expecting.

Instead of getting a true behind the scenes glimpse /and interviews of putting this wonderful show together-you get a gag reel type of featurette which lasts about 15 min. This continues into the Q&A with the man himself which you cant take as a serious session with the artist and that lasts about 10 min. So disc 2 which lasts under 30 min not only lacks good bonus features-it wears thin from lack of substance and thats rather dissappointing.
