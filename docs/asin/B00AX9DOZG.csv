It is a little story to remind us to not get so caught up in our lives that we continue to live the same way even if we are not happy.  It is about speaking up, speaking the truth, and enjoying the moments we are given.  No special effects, not expensive production, just a good movie about human relationships.  When reviewers say it is &#34;contrived,&#34; I laugh.  Movies are written for entertainment, sometimes for a message - but why do we pick them apart because a story line is simple?  I do not think the people who say these type things get the message hitting them in the head. Holly Hunter did a good job, as did the women who played the sisters.  The most important part of the movie, the second half, was in English and not subtitled allowing us to dig into the movie versus trying to read, feel, and figure out the story meaning.
