Season 2 sees new aliens, a new villain, and never loses it's charm and humor that it's noted for. You also find out that Ben Tennyson isn't the only hero in the family. Too, the bond between Ben and Gwen grows even stronger and that's a good thing as all they did in Season 1 was argue. Course, lol, they still argue. Kevin Levin, Dr. Animo, the Forever Knights, Hex, and Vilgax all make their appearances throughout the season's thirteen episodes. The creators include plenty of DVD extras such as how to draw Heatblast, a producer details information on a few of Ben's alien identities, four of the episodes include deleted scenes, and a group of the creators provide audio commentary of behind-the-scenes information for the episode ""Ghostfreaked Out."".

I enjoyed the second season of Ben 10 as it further shows him figuring out how the Omnitrex works and finding not only a new form that he can morph into.  But also being able to switch into any of the forms by just thinking about it.  Very well done 13 episodes that also have deleted scenes on a few of the episodes and a return of Gwen's ""Lucky Girl"" character along with some familiar bad guys to boot as well like Vilgas (sp).

With 13 more new-to-DVD episodes full of awesome adventures and madcap mishaps, it's never a dull summer for Ben Tennyson, his cousin Gwen, and Grandpa Max.  Especially with Ben's alien hero forms like Four Arms, Wildmutt, Stinkfly, and new aliens like Wildvine and Cannonbolt (Two of my personal favorites).Episodes include:""Truth"" - An old friend of Grandpa Max has gone bad.  It's up to him and Ben to stop his nasty plot.""Grudge Match"" - Ben and Kevin 11 have been abducted and imprisoned in a huge alien carrier where they are forced to fight other alien creatures.""Gwen 10"" - What if it was Gwen - not Ben - who found the Omnitrix and its alien powers within it ?  This episode lets us find out.""Dr. Animo and the Mutant Ray"" - The evil Dr. Animo returns for revenge.  Ben must stop him again in rather bizarre alien combos thanks to a broken part in the Omnitrix.""Ghostfreaked Out"" - Ben discovers that Ghostfreak has escaped the device.  Now Ben must find a way to get the ghostly alien back into the watch.Special features include an episode commentary, another how-to-draw feature (this time, the fiery Heatblast), deleted scenes, and a in-depth look at Ben's alien heroes.Well, I guess I'll be waiting for the third season of Ben and his LONG road trip.
