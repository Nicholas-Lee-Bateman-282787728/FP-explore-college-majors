917283,AZCFS1OAU86YK,B0009ZE9XA,C. Cloutier,"[9, 12]","These are the Seuss features we all know and love.  There's only one problem: the DVD transfer.  So far I've only watched ""The Cat In The Hat"" and ""The Grinch Grinches The Cat In The Hat"".  ""The Cat In The Hat"" seemed to be as I recall on television so many moons ago.  But it's ""The Grinch Grinches The Cat In The Hat"" that the DVD transfer is pathetic at best.  If you bought the original ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" DVD, you'll know what I'm talking about.  The color is erratic.  The color of the Grinch goes from brown to yellow to mustard to light green to dark green.  The color of the Grinch's car goes from brown to blue to purple.  I never saw this feature before, but I can say with near certainty that this psychedelic rainbow effect was not in the original airing, nor was it intended.  It certainly detracts from the feature, making for a sub-par product (much like the original ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" DVD which I purchased but refuse to watch after seeing it once, instead relying on my old VHS where the colors are correct).",3,"Good content, bad DVD transfer",1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,1055,"['are', 'Seuss', 'know', 'love', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'far', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'Grinch', 'Grinches', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'seemed', 'be', 'recall', 'television', 'so', 'many', 'moons', 'ago', 'Grinch', 'Grinches', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'pathetic', 'best', 'bought', 'original', 'How', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'color', 'erratic', 'color', 'Grinch', 'brown', 'yellow', 'mustard', 'light', 'green', 'dark', 'green', 'color', 'Grinch', 'car', 'brown', 'blue', 'purple', 'never', 'saw', 'feature', 'can', 'say', 'near', 'certainty', 'psychedelic', 'rainbow', 'effect', 'was', 'not', 'original', 'airing', 'was', 'intended', 'certainly', 'feature', 'making', 'sub-par', 'product', 'much', 'original', 'How', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'refuse', 'watch', 'seeing', 'once', 'instead', 'relying', 'old', 'VHS', 'where', 'colors', 'are', 'correct']",Seuss Celebration: (The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat / The Cat in the Hat / Green Eggs and Ham / The Lorax)
917284,ALW1636GEPC0J,B0009ZE9XA,"JP ""JP""","[8, 8]","Ted Geisel falls under the category of literary genius to me and I've been a fan of his books since a small child-I am more convinced of this than ever after reading/hearing more about his life story and experiences!  All signs point to the impression that he truly wanted most to use his great imagination and storytelling skills in childrens books not mainly to make money for himself, but to have a positive impact on society.The long term influence some of Dr. Seuss's books can have on kids into their adulthood is hard to overstate.  Who could forget the senseless greed and lonely destruction of the Lorax, the poor outcast Sneetches....the stubborn and silly Zax?  The dangers of power and selfishness (The Oobleck, Yertle the Turtle).....the lessons of Solla Sollew, Horton, etc.  The morals are so skillfully woven into the stories and unusual and entertaining artwork sometimes kids aren't even aware they are being taught useful life knowledge-- and some of it is quite useful and worth remembering, indeed!  Things many ""grown ups"" should take a second look at, and some forget on a daily basis.  The world might be a better place if all kids read these books.I only recently rediscovered the animated shorts, many produced and written by Dr. Seuss himself, and this DVD is a great collection for any Seuss fan.Let me say first that in my opinion, I have found Seuss's ""seuss-ness"" notoriously difficult for other artists or entertainers to recreate.....and almost to a one they fail miserably-  falling into nonsensical wackiness, childish pandering or just plain stupidness.  The Jim Carrey and Mike Myers movies, the new Horton cartoon, the ""Seussville"" puppet show, all of these were largely disappointments.  But I'll allow these are mostly directed to bring ""clownish sunshine"" to children.  What is missing I think most is the sort of timeless/clever insightfulness about Seuss that were directed to appeal toward adults as well as children- just like the old Warner Bros cartoons.  (For example, his Sneetches story was actually a secret political statement about the Jews in Germany forced to wear yellow stars, WWII.  The Lorax, about corporate greed after he saw stands of ""Truffula-like"" trees being senselessly mowed down in Africa....and of course the Butter Battle Book, about the nuclear arms race.)But here I was pleased to find that the Lorax, which was one of my favorite childhood  books (and I was surprised to find out, was Mr. Geisel's) was very well done in animated short, in my opinion is arguably better than the book itself.  This one clip alone made buying the DVD worth the money.The Sneetches, Zax, and Green Eggs and Ham were also well done.  Of course, these also were produced and directed by the books author, and had the help of talented animator Chuck Jones.I have read here complaints about the colors/transfers of some of these on this DVD version and I have to say I really didn't notice much of a problem, I thought the DVD porting of all the animations was fine.  Although, I might think differently if I had seen a clearer or better version.Now on to my complaints, lol.  First of all, I am not sure why the most well known animated work, The Grinch Stole Christmas, is deliberately missing here-- also missing in the new Horton Deluxe DVD.  Basically to have this key film you are forced to double up on the Horton story by buying three CDs and having two copies of the same movie.  A marketing ploy, maybe, but just plain irritating!  Curse you, Universal distributors, you already have plenty enough of my money.The quality of animation in my opinion drops quite a bit with a number of the other shorts on this DVD - such as The Grinch meets the Cat in the Hat, Potoffel Pock's Piano and Halloween/Grinch Night.  These last two clips I believe were so short-changed by the low quality animation rendering that they might have easily been classics on par with Grinch Stole Christmas- they are great little stories!  Seuss's Halloween special was daringly imaginative, had great memorable songs and a good theme....but the whole production is just slightly messy and has a hasty thrown together look about it.  Too bad!  I both look forward to and fear a remake of these films.All that being said, this DVD is a must for any Seuss fan to add to their collection, as well as a great gift for any kid, or nostalgic adult!  5 stars.",5,CLASSIC- A MUST BUY!,1245110400,"06 16, 2009",2009,4386,"['Ted', 'Geisel', 'category', 'literary', 'genius', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'books', 'small', 'child-I', 'am', 'more', 'convinced', 'ever', 'reading/hearing', 'more', 'life', 'story', 'experiences', 'signs', 'point', 'impression', 'truly', 'wanted', 'most', 'use', 'great', 'imagination', 'storytelling', 'skills', 'childrens', 'books', 'not', 'mainly', 'make', 'money', 'have', 'positive', 'impact', 'society.The', 'long', 'term', 'influence', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'books', 'can', 'have', 'kids', 'adulthood', 'hard', 'overstate', 'Who', 'could', 'forget', 'senseless', 'greed', 'lonely', 'destruction', 'Lorax', 'poor', 'outcast', 'Sneetches', '.the', 'stubborn', 'silly', 'Zax', 'dangers', 'power', 'selfishness', 'Oobleck', 'Yertle', 'Turtle', '..the', 'lessons', 'Solla', 'Sollew', 'Horton', 'etc', 'morals', 'are', 'so', 'skillfully', 'woven', 'stories', 'unusual', 'entertaining', 'artwork', 'sometimes', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'are', 'being', 'taught', 'useful', 'life', 'knowledge', 'quite', 'useful', 'worth', 'remembering', 'indeed', 'Things', 'many', 'grown', 'ups', 'should', 'take', 'second', 'look', 'forget', 'daily', 'basis', 'world', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'place', 'kids', 'read', 'books.I', 'only', 'recently', 'rediscovered', 'animated', 'shorts', 'many', 'produced', 'written', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'DVD', 'great', 'collection', 'Seuss', 'fan.Let', 'say', 'first', 'opinion', 'have', 'found', 'Seuss', 'seuss-ness', 'notoriously', 'difficult', 'other', 'artists', 'entertainers', 'recreate', 'almost', 'one', 'fail', 'miserably-', 'falling', 'nonsensical', 'wackiness', 'childish', 'pandering', 'just', 'plain', 'stupidness', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'movies', 'new', 'Horton', 'cartoon', 'Seussville', 'puppet', 'show', 'were', 'largely', 'disappointments', ""'ll"", 'allow', 'are', 'mostly', 'directed', 'bring', 'clownish', 'sunshine', 'children', 'What', 'missing', 'think', 'most', 'sort', 'timeless/clever', 'insightfulness', 'Seuss', 'were', 'directed', 'appeal', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'children-', 'just', 'old', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'cartoons', 'example', 'Sneetches', 'story', 'was', 'actually', 'secret', 'political', 'statement', 'Jews', 'Germany', 'forced', 'wear', 'yellow', 'stars', 'WWII', 'Lorax', 'about', 'corporate', 'greed', 'saw', 'stands', 'Truffula-like', 'trees', 'being', 'senselessly', 'mowed', 'down', 'Africa', '.and', 'course', 'Butter', 'Battle', 'Book', 'nuclear', 'arms', 'race', 'here', 'was', 'pleased', 'find', 'Lorax', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'books', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Geisel', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'animated', 'short', 'opinion', 'arguably', 'better', 'book', 'one', 'clip', 'alone', 'made', 'buying', 'DVD', 'money.The', 'Sneetches', 'Zax', 'Green', 'Eggs', 'Ham', 'were', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'course', 'also', 'were', 'produced', 'directed', 'books', 'author', 'had', 'help', 'talented', 'animator', 'Chuck', 'Jones.I', 'have', 'read', 'here', 'complaints', 'colors/transfers', 'DVD', 'version', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'much', 'problem', 'thought', 'DVD', 'porting', 'animations', 'was', 'fine', 'might', 'think', 'differently', 'had', 'seen', 'clearer', 'better', 'version.Now', 'complaints', 'lol', 'First', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'animated', 'work', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'deliberately', 'missing', 'here', 'also', 'missing', 'new', 'Horton', 'Deluxe', 'DVD', 'Basically', 'have', 'key', 'film', 'are', 'forced', 'double', 'up', 'Horton', 'story', 'buying', 'three', 'CDs', 'having', 'two', 'copies', 'same', 'movie', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'maybe', 'just', 'plain', 'irritating', 'Curse', 'Universal', 'distributors', 'already', 'have', 'plenty', 'enough', 'money.The', 'quality', 'animation', 'opinion', 'quite', 'bit', 'number', 'other', 'shorts', 'DVD', 'such', 'Grinch', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'Potoffel', 'Pock', 'Piano', 'Halloween/Grinch', 'Night', 'last', 'two', 'clips', 'believe', 'were', 'so', 'short-changed', 'low', 'quality', 'animation', 'rendering', 'might', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'classics', 'par', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas-', 'are', 'great', 'little', 'stories', 'Seuss', 'Halloween', 'special', 'was', 'daringly', 'imaginative', 'had', 'great', 'memorable', 'songs', 'good', 'theme', 'whole', 'production', 'just', 'slightly', 'messy', 'hasty', 'thrown', 'together', 'look', 'Too', 'bad', 'look', 'forward', 'fear', 'remake', 'films.All', 'being', 'said', 'DVD', 'must', 'Seuss', 'fan', 'add', 'collection', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'gift', 'kid', 'nostalgic', 'adult', '5', 'stars']",Seuss Celebration: (The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat / The Cat in the Hat / Green Eggs and Ham / The Lorax)

917287,A11ED8O95W2103,B0009ZE9XA,"lighten_up_already2 ""lighten_up_already2""","[16, 39]","First of all, this is a great value in childrens' entertainment.  My kids love these cartoons, having watched them each several times.  I personally had not watched these on TV, and was not even aware that they had been created, so it was fun for me to watch them too.However, I've got two issues over which I deducted a star.First, the menus are a mess.  The main menu is based on the cover, and the four features on the cover are easy to find, but we were clicking in and out of menus for a long time trying to make sure we'd watched everything on this DVD.  There was no need to nest some of the cartoons within submenus of other cartoons that they had nothing to do with.  Very confusing.Second, I was shocked at the twisted adaptation of the Cat in the Hat.  In all the other cases where I'd read the corresponding book, the stories and characters remained constant while a lot of filler was added to take up the time necessary to have a cartoon broadcast in a 30 minute time slot.However, the Cat in the Hat seemed a very different character from the one in the book.  In the book, the cat shows up, invites himself in, has a little mischevious fun trashing the house and causing the fish some distress, but then the kids decide that enough is enough and they capture Thing One and Thing Two.  The cat cleans up before Mother gets home.The cartoon begins just like the book.  The two kids are all alone and bored in their house during a rain storm.  The cat invites himself in, is immediately confronted by the fish, has some mischevious fun at his expense, but is soon voted out of the house by the united front of the fish and the kids.  The cat reluctantly but gracefully submits to the will of the majority.  But not for long.Immediately the cat returns to the house fuming with rage because his ""moss covered three handled family credunza"" has been stolen.  Since the Cat ""knows"" that the thief is in the house he invites himself back in and sings a mournful tune of woe and loss that ends with a direct accusation against the fish, and this convinces the kids that the fish is guilty of theft.  (Ironic because the fish is the one of the three in the house who could never have stolen it due to his physical limitations).The cat proceeds to sing another tune while drawing with a marker all over the house in an effort to conduct a thorough search.  The kids don't object anymore because now the are on the side of the cat, having been brainwashed through music to think that their fish is guilty of theft.The fish never admits guilt, but does continue to protest the cat being in the house.  The cat then launches into another show tune.  This one a fit of self-loathing set to cleverly rhyming lyrics.The fish is not impressed and still wants the cat out of the house.  So, the cat decides that the fish needs a ""small tranquilizer"", which turns out to be another show tune, but the reference to drug use is as obvious as it is out-of-place.Now that the moral minority fish has been ""tranquilized"" to sleep, the cat unleashes Thing One and Thing Two for the purpose of helping the cat find his missing ""credunza"", but immediatly the two Things begin torturing the fish as retribution for opposing the cat.  (Unecessary since the fish was asleep)For several minutes, the cat sings that the Things are finding his ""credunza"" while the Things are doing nothing of the sort, but continuing to torture the ""reactionary"" (a classic slur against those who oppose leftist ideologies) fish, having cut the phone lines to the house so the fish can't get help from the FBI.  According to the Things, the fish ""doesn't like flying kites in the house"", but niether the Things nor the cat have even done that yet.The kids rescue the fish from the Things; the fish gets to kick the cat and vent a bit, and then we're subjected to an interminable and dumb show tune about how the word ""cat"" is said in many different languages.Now Mother is sighted, and the Things bolt into their box (they are not captured by the children as in the book); the cat cleans up the house, and Mother comes in the house saying she saw a cat going down the street in a ""moss covered three handled family Credunza"".  So the cat lied in the first place about it being stolen!So, in summary, here is the lesson taught by the Cat in the Hat cartoon version.First, if the opinion of the majority is against you, lie to gain victim status.Second, once you're a victim and have the moral authority that comes with victimhood, accuse your moral opposition of a crime without any evidence, and even a crime that they could never have possibly committed.  Once presumed guilty, you can terrorize them with impunity.  No trial necessary; just get the children on your side.Indulge in self-loathing to gain pity.Brainwash children against your opposition through music so they reach conclusions without thinking.Try to ""tranquilize"" your opposition and lull them to sleep.Bring in enforcers and sing about the justice they're seeking while they're torturing your opposition.The bottom line is that in the book the children are protective of the interests of their family and eventually put a stop to the chaos before Mom gets home.  In this cartoon the children are converted to the side of chaos, leaving only a grumpy ""reactionary louse"" fish to oppose the chaos, which for some strange reason ends itself before Mom gets home.  The children have changed sides, and perhaps this is intentionally or not, quite an accurate commentary on politics since the late 1960's.",3,Great value marred by twisted adaptation of Cat in the
