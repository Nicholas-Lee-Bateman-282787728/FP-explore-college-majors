I was delighted to see the first season free for Prime members (bring on the following seasons, please; fun to bring my Amazon Fire to bed and watch an episode). My family teases me for watching this sometimes schmaltzy series, but I really enjoy it. The characters are well developed (and some will drive you crazy) and many of the plots are very good. Some are unbelievable (meaning, you won't believe them because they are so far-fetched), but I can forgive those for the sake of the others. I had missed this when it was originally broadcast. I asked a friend of mine if she used to watch it and why. She answered, &#34;DUH! Sully!&#34; That made me laugh, but he is quite the man. I want to believe that there are people in this world who are like him, but alas, there may be more fiction here than fact. Having said that though, I am a sucker for good family entertainment, and this fits the bill. It's a little less schmaltzy than &#34;Little House on the Prairie&#34; (if you want to see a more realistic DVD on what Laura Ingalls Wilder's life was like, rent &#34;Beyond the Prairie&#34;; it was a little truer to real life than the series was...just keep in mind that the guy who plays her husband, Walton Goggins, is Boyd the Bad Guy on &#34;Justified.&#34; It was sure fun to see him play a tender, loving man).",5,Love this family series,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1402,"[""'m"", 'watching', 'series', 'second', 'time', 'having', 'bought', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'first', 'season', 'free', 'Prime', 'members', 'bring', 'following', 'seasons', 'please', 'fun', 'bring', 'Amazon', 'Fire', 'bed', 'watch', 'episode', 'family', 'watching', 'sometimes', 'schmaltzy', 'series', 'really', 'enjoy', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'will', 'drive', 'crazy', 'many', 'plots', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'meaning', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'are', 'so', 'far-fetched', 'can', 'forgive', 'sake', 'others', 'had', 'missed', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'asked', 'friend', 'mine', 'used', 'watch', 'why', 'answered', '34', 'DUH', 'Sully', '34', 'made', 'laugh', 'quite', 'man', 'want', 'believe', 'are', 'people', 'world', 'who', 'are', 'alas', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'fiction', 'here', 'fact', 'Having', 'said', 'am', 'sucker', 'good', 'family', 'entertainment', 'bill', 'little', 'less', 'schmaltzy', '34', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', '34', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'realistic', 'DVD', 'what', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'life', 'was', 'rent', '34', 'Beyond', 'Prairie', '34', 'was', 'little', 'truer', 'real', 'life', 'series', 'was', 'just', 'keep', 'mind', 'guy', 'who', 'husband', 'Walton', 'Goggins', 'Boyd', 'Bad', 'Guy', '34', 'Justified.', '34', 'was', 'sure', 'fun', 'see', 'play', 'tender', 'loving', 'man']",N/A

Even though she was not cast until last minute, Jane Seymour was just the PERFECT lead actress as Dr. Mike Quinn.  It was fun watching the beginning episodes all over again.  When I finished the first season I was being bored out of my mind because there aren't any good shows on TV anymore.  I couldn't wait until the second season came out.  This series was one of the best ever to be created.  It had some of the best acting ever, and even the children did great work.  Every character had a chance to show what they were capable of and could accomplish.  This show is not just for old people; it's a show for all ages and could be watched with the entire family.  I'm only a fifteen year old and still find it quite fascinating.The DVDs themselves were also great.  The quality of the picture is pretty good.  The sound is Dolby Digital, so it's okay.  All five discs come in pretty cool individual boxes, like the average A&amp;E TV show box sets like the ""Mr. Bean"" DVD.  There is no booklet; instead the episode descriptions are on the back of each volume.  The makers could have chosen a better front cover and had the children on it, like the second season does.  This product would be even better if there were subtitles and some pictures of each scene at the scene selection menu.The special features were not that great and could have been better. The A&amp;E Documentary was just brilliant.  It was really interesting and you learn some interesting facts in it.  It was fun seeing how Jane Seymour had looked like and changed over the past years.  A commentary, some bloopers and deleted scenes might have been nice, along with some TV spots.  I don't think any season DVDs has had them before, besides ""Malcolm in the Middle.""  Hopefully the actors will come back for featurettes or show makings and do commentaries.  It would also be interesting to know what the actors are doing nowadays, and why they did certain things: like why Erika Flores (Colleen Cooper) had left this amazing show.This box set certainly deserves 5 out 5 stars definitely because of the show itself and you should buy it NOW along with the second season if you haven't done so already.  It's absolutely marvelous; there's no doubt about it.  No show on TV now, like this one, can compare to it.  The price might be a minor problem for some and the future seasons possibly could and should be a little inexpensive.  It is an excellent addition to anyone's DVD collection.

There is romance, history, drama, Indians, beautiful scenery, etc. The actors and story telling are great.The reason I rated this four stars instead of five is price and packaging.

738458,A1UGBHFRUDNYD1,B00008DDIW,"Nenah Sylver ""Nenah Sylver, PhD, author""","[13, 14]","Ditching my TV in the mid 1980s made me happy. There was not much worth watching. When I acquired a secondhand TV ten years later, it was for video movies only (and then DVDs, when they became popular). But I was running out of movies. I was sick of all the gratuitous sex and violence--and the depiction of women as vapid sex kittens, their value in meeting Mr. Right, and men as James Bond clones.Then I met Dr. Quinn.The glowing Amazon reviews inspired me to start renting. What I was not prepared for was how feminism suffuses this series. What are ""family values,"" exactly? Not the insipid standards from sit-com land, where humor consists of putting someone down at the expense of another. These ""family values"" are kindness, reverence for nature, respect of people regardless of race or gender...in short, the golden rule to treat others as one would want to be treated. A TV show that includes respect for women as independent, intelligent people is a rare find. But one might expect this in a series that a woman conceived, women produced, and where the majority of episodes were written by women as well.The feminism in Dr. Quinn is not devoid of art. It's not a political statement smacking you in the face. It's an organic part of the story. The story is always first, which is what makes this show so great. We sympathize with Dr. Quinn as she struggles against the sexism and patronizing attitudes of the townspeople, trying to set down roots as the ""lady doctor.""Racism takes its rightful place alongside feminism. We are rightfully horrified by the white people's mistreatment of the sensitively portrayed Cheyenne Indians (of particular note is the wonderful wise character of Cloud Dancing). And we see how the town's hatred and mistreatment of black people poisons, especially the ones who hate. The writers achieve a nice balance between depicting the world as it was, while simultaneously showing that the ""world as it was"" was sometimes very misguided.For the first half dozen episodes, Jane Seymour does not seem to have settled into her character. It takes almost the entire first season to sense her as a rounded person. But if the characters are not quite developed, they are not caricatured either. The acting is superb, making one want to know more about these people whose lives are already so intertwined and promise to be more so in future seasons. It's unusual to have such a large cast; but every person stands out as an individual with something to offer the plot.As Jane Seymour states in one of the special features, she did considerable research to make sure that the medicine of that time period was accurately portrayed. The thousand of little details, from costumes to sets (and horseback riding skills) all add to the authenticity of the episodes.Season One, which provides the foundation for subsequent seasons, left me with an urgent desire to see more. Highly recommended. I'm giving this 4 stars because most of the other seasons are even better.",4,Feminism as a Family Value,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,2991,"['Ditching', 'TV', 'mid', '1980s', 'made', 'happy', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'watching', 'When', 'acquired', 'secondhand', 'TV', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'video', 'movies', 'only', 'then', 'DVDs', 'when', 'became', 'popular', 'was', 'running', 'out', 'movies', 'was', 'sick', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'violence', 'depiction', 'women', 'vapid', 'sex', 'kittens', 'value', 'meeting', 'Mr', 'Right', 'men', 'James', 'Bond', 'clones.Then', 'met', 'Dr.', 'Quinn.The', 'glowing', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'inspired', 'start', 'renting', 'What', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'was', 'how', 'feminism', 'series', 'What', 'are', 'family', 'values', 'exactly', 'Not', 'insipid', 'standards', 'sit-com', 'land', 'where', 'humor', 'putting', 'someone', 'down', 'expense', 'family', 'values', 'are', 'kindness', 'reverence', 'nature', 'respect', 'people', 'regardless', 'race', 'gender', 'short', 'golden', 'rule', 'treat', 'others', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'treated', 'TV', 'show', 'respect', 'women', 'independent', 'intelligent', 'people', 'rare', 'find', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'series', 'woman', 'conceived', 'women', 'produced', 'where', 'majority', 'episodes', 'were', 'written', 'women', 'well.The', 'feminism', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'not', 'devoid', 'art', 'not', 'political', 'statement', 'smacking', 'face', 'organic', 'part', 'story', 'story', 'always', 'first', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'great', 'sympathize', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'sexism', 'patronizing', 'attitudes', 'townspeople', 'trying', 'set', 'down', 'roots', 'lady', 'doctor', 'Racism', 'rightful', 'place', 'alongside', 'feminism', 'are', 'rightfully', 'horrified', 'white', 'people', 'mistreatment', 'sensitively', 'portrayed', 'Cheyenne', 'Indians', 'particular', 'note', 'wonderful', 'wise', 'character', 'Cloud', 'Dancing', 'see', 'how', 'town', 'hatred', 'mistreatment', 'black', 'people', 'poisons', 'especially', 'ones', 'who', 'hate', 'writers', 'achieve', 'nice', 'balance', 'depicting', 'world', 'was', 'simultaneously', 'showing', 'world', 'was', 'was', 'sometimes', 'very', 'misguided.For', 'first', 'half', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'settled', 'character', 'almost', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'sense', 'rounded', 'person', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'developed', 'are', 'not', 'caricatured', 'either', 'acting', 'superb', 'making', 'one', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'people', 'lives', 'are', 'already', 'so', 'intertwined', 'promise', 'be', 'more', 'so', 'future', 'seasons', 'unusual', 'have', 'large', 'cast', 'person', 'out', 'individual', 'something', 'offer', 'plot.As', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'states', 'one', 'special', 'features', 'did', 'considerable', 'research', 'make', 'sure', 'medicine', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'thousand', 'little', 'details', 'costumes', 'sets', 'horseback', 'riding', 'skills', 'add', 'authenticity', 'episodes.Season', 'One', 'foundation', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'left', 'urgent', 'desire', 'see', 'more', 'Highly', 'recommended', ""'m"", 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'most', 'other', 'seasons', 'are', 'even', 'better']",N/A

Jane Seymour in one of her best career performances, plays a female doctor, Michaela Quinn, who puts conventions aside to practice medicine in the frontier town of Colorado Springs, Colorado, leaving behind a life of comfort in her native Boston. Though she doesn't quite expect a warm welcome, she is initially unprepared by the hostility displayed by the townsfolk, especially the men, who think women should be wives and mothers, and nothing more.The strong pilot episode introduces viewers to Michaela's early beginnings in Colorado Springs. The other main character is Byron Sully (an amazing performance by Joe Lando), a man most at home with nature and with his friends, the Cheyenne, at a time when the Native Americans were shunned and feared by most white folk, mostly out of ignorance, and were hunted down like wild animals. The strong on-screen chemistry between Dr. Quinn and Sullly translates into a credible romance between the two characters, and a beautiful love story that plays out over the seasons ( the show ran for six seasons over the CBS network).There are many themes explored in this show - women's rights, the oppression of the Native Americans, the fight for equality, friendship, loyalty, the harsh life of frontier living, and of course, love.
