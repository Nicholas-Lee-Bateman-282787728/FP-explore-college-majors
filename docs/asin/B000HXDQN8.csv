The 3 discs span 30 years of Johnny - and include many great guests, Johnny's characters, and monologues.  The ""Lost Episode"" featuring a suprise visit by Bob Hope, Dean Martin, and George Gobel is particularly great.  If you want to own the perfect Carson library - buy The Ultimate Collection first, this collection second, and I would add both Carson Comic's DVDs and Carson Country to get a great overview of the best talk show in history.",5,More Great Johnny,1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,622,"['other', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'set', 'already', 'own', 'full', 'Carson', 'Club', 'DVD', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'look', 'back', 'King', 'Latenight', '3', 'discs', 'span', '30', 'years', 'Johnny', 'include', 'many', 'great', 'guests', 'Johnny', 'characters', 'monologues', 'Lost', 'Episode', 'featuring', 'suprise', 'visit', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'George', 'Gobel', 'particularly', 'great', 'want', 'own', 'perfect', 'Carson', 'library', 'buy', 'Ultimate', 'Collection', 'first', 'collection', 'second', 'would', 'add', 'Carson', 'Comic', 'DVDs', 'Carson', 'Country', 'get', 'great', 'overview', 'best', 'talk', 'show', 'history']","The Best of Carson, Volume 1"

Johnny was and will always be the King of Latenight.  That being said, this selection contains repeats from other series and they must have had limited access to his 30 years of shows or choose to spread the great ones over many sets and repeat some in whole or in part.  On the 3 DVD's I found only a few really good bits the rest were fair to boring. The great shows must have been spread over the 9 sets being sold under various titles and the FEW bits in the lost Episodes were early 60's B&W.  These while somewhat ordinary, contained some material better than the rest of the 3 disk set. Rent it, view it but definitely not a keeper. I bought this set and others for bragging rights to say I have several sets of Johnny. I was surprised at the amount of laugh track type forced laughter displayed during many of the guests appearances and definitely during his monologues.  His material was weaker than I remember but Johnny style and delivery make the ordinary seem really great.  No one can ever top his style, delivery and his famous facial expressions.",1,King of Latenight-repeated from other disks-poor selection,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,1179,"['am', '65', 'stayed', 'up', 'many', 'nights', 'watch', 'Johnny', 'even', 'thought', 'had', 'leave', 'work', 'morning', '5:30am', 'Johnny', 'was', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'King', 'Latenight', 'being', 'said', 'selection', 'repeats', 'other', 'series', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'limited', 'access', '30', 'years', 'shows', 'choose', 'spread', 'great', 'ones', 'many', 'sets', 'repeat', 'whole', 'part', '3', 'DVD', 'found', 'only', 'few', 'really', 'good', 'bits', 'rest', 'were', 'fair', 'boring', 'great', 'shows', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'spread', '9', 'sets', 'being', 'sold', 'various', 'titles', 'FEW', 'bits', 'lost', 'Episodes', 'were', 'early', '60', 'B', 'W', 'somewhat', 'ordinary', 'contained', 'material', 'better', 'rest', '3', 'disk', 'set', 'Rent', 'definitely', 'not', 'keeper', 'bought', 'set', 'others', 'bragging', 'rights', 'say', 'have', 'several', 'sets', 'Johnny', 'was', 'surprised', 'amount', 'laugh', 'track', 'type', 'forced', 'laughter', 'displayed', 'many', 'guests', 'appearances', 'definitely', 'monologues', 'material', 'was', 'weaker', 'remember', 'Johnny', 'style', 'delivery', 'make', 'ordinary', 'seem', 'really', 'great', 'one', 'can', 'ever', 'top', 'style', 'delivery', 'famous', 'facial', 'expressions']","The Best of Carson, Volume 1"
