It includes those great singable lyrics of his 1960s hits.  The songs are not edited down, and Neil displays his usual enthusiasm in entertaining his audience.  I also have a DVD entitled Neil Sedaka--Live in Concert at the Jubilee Hall, but it is not as good as this one, The Show Goes On.  My after school music students in grades four through seven enjoyed seeing him perform the songs they were introduced to previously.  If you enjoy his music you can't go wrong in adding this concert to your collection.",5,This Is The One To Buy,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,579,"['have', 'two', 'Neil', 'Sedaka', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'one', 'best', 'great', 'singable', 'lyrics', '1960s', 'hits', 'songs', 'are', 'not', 'edited', 'down', 'Neil', 'usual', 'enthusiasm', 'entertaining', 'audience', 'also', 'have', 'DVD', 'entitled', 'Neil', 'Sedaka', 'Live', 'Concert', 'Jubilee', 'Hall', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'Show', 'Goes', 'school', 'music', 'students', 'grades', 'four', 'seven', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'perform', 'songs', 'were', 'introduced', 'previously', 'enjoy', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'adding', 'concert', 'collection']",N/A

The older great songs he sand did not seem to be with the quality they had when they first hit the market.
