1016483,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B000HT3Q28,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[0, 0]","Daniel, (Ash Newman) is urged by his grandmother to search across all of Europe to locate her fathers grave and end the mystery she wants solved before her death. Too old to make the trip herself, she arms Daniel with a little money and some clues and he hesitantly sets off to unravel the mystery and bring her peace.His mission was a puzzling one that led him from one dead-end lead to another, where he did manage to locate information about the life his great grandfather lived and learn about the heritage his family posessed. However, as Daniel goes on his way it begins to become more clear throughout the film, that his great grandfather is not really the man his grandmother intended for him to find, but rather to find himself through the experience. She doesn't want to die without knowing Daniel will be able to take care of himself and know what his life is all about. She also wants to makes sure he is aware of his family roots and that this rich heritage may be one he will pass down to future generations, if he can only learn to grasp it and appreciate it.This was an ""OK"" film, and it held my attention throughout, however there were places where I got lost and found it hard to figure out. Trying to follow the visual of the film and keep up with the subtitles at the same time, left some moments of confusion. There are films you want to watch over and over again and then there are films like SHEM. For me, one time was enough.I suppose I had high hopes for this movie that it simply couldn't live up to and I was rather disappointed by the plot which I did not have a good understanding of  before viewing it. It was not an unpleasant film to me, and did contain lots of adventure, sights all around Europe with some history and culture that make it a good watch.The acting was pretty good as was most everything in the production. Before viewing it, I would suggest reading the discription carefully as well as the reviews, so you can have a better understanding of the film in advance. There have been several reviews added since I purchased this DVD, which might have made this a more enjoyable film for me. I hope the addition of my review will give you a little more information to go on and make SHEM a more enjoyable adventure for you.",3,In search of a man,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,2265,"['Daniel', 'Ash', 'Newman', 'urged', 'grandmother', 'search', 'Europe', 'locate', 'fathers', 'grave', 'end', 'mystery', 'solved', 'death', 'Too', 'old', 'make', 'trip', 'herself', 'Daniel', 'little', 'money', 'clues', 'hesitantly', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'bring', 'peace.His', 'mission', 'was', 'puzzling', 'one', 'led', 'one', 'dead-end', 'lead', 'where', 'did', 'manage', 'locate', 'information', 'life', 'great', 'grandfather', 'lived', 'learn', 'heritage', 'family', 'posessed', 'However', 'Daniel', 'way', 'become', 'more', 'clear', 'film', 'great', 'grandfather', 'not', 'really', 'man', 'grandmother', 'intended', 'find', 'rather', 'find', 'experience', ""n't"", 'want', 'die', 'knowing', 'Daniel', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'care', 'know', 'what', 'life', 'also', 'sure', 'aware', 'family', 'roots', 'rich', 'heritage', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'will', 'pass', 'down', 'future', 'generations', 'can', 'only', 'learn', 'grasp', 'appreciate', 'it.This', 'was', 'OK', 'film', 'held', 'attention', 'however', 'were', 'places', 'where', 'got', 'lost', 'found', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'Trying', 'follow', 'visual', 'film', 'keep', 'up', 'subtitles', 'same', 'time', 'left', 'moments', 'confusion', 'are', 'films', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'then', 'are', 'films', 'SHEM', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'enough.I', 'suppose', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'plot', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'good', 'understanding', 'viewing', 'was', 'not', 'unpleasant', 'film', 'did', 'contain', 'lots', 'adventure', 'sights', 'Europe', 'history', 'culture', 'make', 'good', 'watch.The', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'most', 'everything', 'production', 'viewing', 'would', 'suggest', 'reading', 'discription', 'carefully', 'as', 'well', 'reviews', 'can', 'have', 'better', 'understanding', 'film', 'advance', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'reviews', 'added', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'hope', 'addition', 'review', 'will', 'give', 'little', 'more', 'information', 'go', 'make', 'SHEM', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'adventure']",Shem
