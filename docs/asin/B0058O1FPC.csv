1445365,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B0058O1FPC,D.P.,"[5, 7]","A.J. (Triple H) is an ex-convict who was in jail for 13 years for manslaughter.  The man to meet him when he gets out is his best friend, Jack (Michael Rapaport), who's a low-level mobster working for his father Dr. Vic (Bruce Dern) & also married to A.J. ex-girlfriend Claire (Parker Posey) with them having a daughter named Pepper (Juliette Goglia).  When Jack tries to get A.J. back in the game, he tells him that he's not going back into mob work & just wants to have his own business making pickles (which becomes a running joke throughout the whole movie) but ends up being at the wrong place at the wrong time when Jack accidentally shoots someone he's was only suppose to collect money from for his father causing him to handle the situation while Jack kept the money for himself & left town.  It later turns out that the man Jack shot was an undercover informant for Martha (Julie White), an agent for the Louisiana Tax Board, who's out to get Dr. Vic for tax evasion & illegal smuggling but also gets the police involved when she informs Detective Calgrove (Michael Cudlitz) about her informant missing only to find out about the shooting.  After Dr. Vic finds out that the deal went back & he didn't get his money, A.J. said he would handle it only for Vic to decide to take matters into his own hands.  So A.J. must deal with trying to protect Jack's family & address the issues between him & Claire, dealing with Martha & Det. Calgrove who are determined to get Vic with or without his help, Jack's out of control attitude, and Vic's deadly assistant Irena (Jency Griffin) who had a habit of leaving notes saying ""Kaboom"" before something bad happens.The main character Triple H plays here is very similar to the one he did in his previous movie ""The Chaperone"" where he's an ex-con who's out trying to turn his life around but keeps ending up in these bad situations with people from his past however the difference here is that this movie takes a more serious approach instead of comedic with the exception of the constant pickle references here.  They had some establish actors throughout the movie & the story was good, there wasn't anything here really memorable or would make me watch it again after the first viewing so it's worth a rental & you make your own call.",3,"""The Game"" Gets Himself In Quite The...Pickle",1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,2285,"['A.J', 'Triple', 'H', 'ex-convict', 'who', 'was', 'jail', '13', 'years', 'manslaughter', 'man', 'meet', 'when', 'out', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'who', 'low-level', 'mobster', 'working', 'father', 'Dr.', 'Vic', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'also', 'married', 'A.J', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Claire', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'having', 'daughter', 'named', 'Pepper', 'Juliette', 'Goglia', 'When', 'Jack', 'get', 'A.J', 'back', 'game', 'not', 'going', 'back', 'mob', 'work', 'just', 'have', 'own', 'business', 'making', 'pickles', 'running', 'joke', 'whole', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'when', 'Jack', 'accidentally', 'someone', 'was', 'only', 'suppose', 'collect', 'money', 'father', 'causing', 'handle', 'situation', 'Jack', 'kept', 'money', 'left', 'town', 'later', 'out', 'man', 'Jack', 'shot', 'was', 'undercover', 'informant', 'Martha', 'Julie', 'White', 'agent', 'Louisiana', 'Tax', 'Board', 'who', 'out', 'get', 'Dr.', 'Vic', 'tax', 'evasion', 'illegal', 'smuggling', 'also', 'police', 'involved', 'when', 'Detective', 'Calgrove', 'Michael', 'Cudlitz', 'informant', 'missing', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'shooting', 'Dr.', 'Vic', 'out', 'deal', 'went', 'back', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'money', 'A.J', 'said', 'would', 'handle', 'only', 'Vic', 'decide', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'So', 'A.J', 'must', 'deal', 'trying', 'protect', 'Jack', 'family', 'address', 'issues', 'Claire', 'dealing', 'Martha', 'Det', 'Calgrove', 'who', 'are', 'determined', 'get', 'Vic', 'help', 'Jack', 'control', 'attitude', 'Vic', 'deadly', 'assistant', 'Irena', 'Jency', 'Griffin', 'who', 'had', 'habit', 'leaving', 'notes', 'saying', 'Kaboom', 'something', 'bad', 'happens.The', 'main', 'character', 'Triple', 'H', 'here', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'did', 'previous', 'movie', 'Chaperone', 'where', 'ex-con', 'who', 'out', 'trying', 'turn', 'life', 'ending', 'up', 'bad', 'situations', 'people', 'past', 'however', 'difference', 'here', 'movie', 'more', 'serious', 'approach', 'instead', 'comedic', 'exception', 'constant', 'pickle', 'references', 'here', 'had', 'establish', 'actors', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'here', 'really', 'memorable', 'would', 'make', 'watch', 'again', 'first', 'viewing', 'rental', 'make', 'own', 'call']",Inside Out

Ole Big Nose starts the movie the exact same way as he did his last movie, he is released from prison and wants to drive someone else's car... must be a clause in Triple-H's contract that he will not make a movie unless he is an ex-con who drives a car in the released from prison scenes. This time tho, The Game is picked up by his best friend and goes to stay with him, all while telling his friend he wants no part in cigarette smuggling, he just wants to make pickles. I'm not lying, I swear, it's true, the Cerebral Assassin spends a majority of this movie either eating pickles, talking about pickles, or playing with his pickles. Triple-Hemorrhoids buddy is married to Trip's lover before he went to prison. The bud's father wants his son to collect some money, and in a ridicules scene he shoots dead the guy who the FBI or someone planted, so now the buddy and Triple-HIV dispose of the body and cause a commotion with the cops and the buds dad who wants his own son killed now for being so stupid, and asking .... wait, stop... the plot sounds dumb enough already, right? Check it out if you must, but trust me, this movie is somewhat original, but a complete load of hard to swallow b.s. In fact, The Rock would say this movie is 10 pounds of monkey cr#@ in a 5 pound bag.Don't get me wrong, I love DX, and Hunter is a fav wrestler of mine, but this movie, ha, well, all I can say it, I love Hulk Hogan too, but no way in hell am I ever going to watch ""The Secret Agent Club"". This movie is a mess of random ideas and hard to swallow BS that keeps imploding with massive stenches of Jim Ross's seven day old underwear.
