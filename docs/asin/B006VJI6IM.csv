1520265,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B006VJI6IM,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[27, 32]","Seminary student Ryan is doing his Master's thesis on the working of God's love, a topic that he is somewhat confused about in his own life.  Ryan is among a handful of closeted gay seminarians, though none of them are close enough to him to really confide how he longs to have a real boyfriend. He is close with his mother, but has not opened up to her about his sexual orientation.  He did confide on a girl he trusted, which may have been a bad idea.  Meanwhile, the closest thing that he has found in looking for a life partner is Bradley, a guy he met online, but there seems to be issues there that threaten it from developing as he would like.Writer/Director Joshua Lim presents an emotionally intense look at life and love, as well as raising some theoretical (rather than strictly theological) questions about how we reflect God's love through our relationships.  The acting (especially Mark Cirillo as Ryan) is first rate, and it is easy to see why this was a favorite at many gay film festivals over the past year and a half.DVD to include audio commentary and interview with Cirillo, not rated but would be a light R for sexual situations. I give it four stars out of five.",4,Intensely emotional look at liffe and love.,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,1185,"['Seminary', 'student', 'Ryan', 'doing', 'Master', 'thesis', 'working', 'God', 'love', 'topic', 'somewhat', 'confused', 'own', 'life', 'Ryan', 'handful', 'closeted', 'gay', 'seminarians', 'none', 'are', 'close', 'enough', 'really', 'confide', 'how', 'have', 'real', 'boyfriend', 'close', 'mother', 'not', 'opened', 'up', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'did', 'confide', 'girl', 'trusted', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'idea', 'Meanwhile', 'closest', 'thing', 'found', 'looking', 'life', 'partner', 'Bradley', 'guy', 'met', 'online', 'there', 'be', 'issues', 'threaten', 'developing', 'would', 'like.Writer/Director', 'Joshua', 'Lim', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'look', 'life', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'raising', 'theoretical', 'rather', 'strictly', 'theological', 'questions', 'how', 'reflect', 'God', 'love', 'relationships', 'acting', 'especially', 'Mark', 'Cirillo', 'Ryan', 'first', 'rate', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'favorite', 'many', 'gay', 'film', 'festivals', 'past', 'year', 'half.DVD', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'interview', 'Cirillo', 'not', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'light', 'R', 'sexual', 'situations', 'give', 'four', 'five']",The Seminarian

1520267,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B006VJI6IM,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[12, 14]","I will not try to offer a recommendation either way on this film, as it deals with subject matter that everyone must determine for themselves whether or not they wish to view. I DO HOWEVER feel that a different kind of review is necessary for this film. A viewpoint that no-one else seems to be offering. Perhaps a side that no-one else seems to have caught, as most will either love a film, or hate it, with no middle ground. And thus, I give you my review to add to the mix.Ryan, (Mark Cirillo) is a student in his final semester of seminary studies. He has to complete a solid theological thesis in order to continue his studies at the university of his choice. To receive the grade, his thesis must be solid, factual and based on biblical beliefs, not just personal feelings. Ryan is also gay and struggling with those feelings and his desire to stay true to his religious beliefs. Can he convince his professor that he has a full understanding of the subject of his thesis: ""The Divine Gift of Love""?The film is directed by Joshua Lim and based on his own life and the lives of other students he met during seminary studies. There is some interesting reading online about Joshua Lim as well as the making of this film. You can find it easily through Google. As I read the reviews for this movie, everything inside of me told me to move on and don't waste my time and money on it. However, the subject matter intrigued me for some reason a bit more than other films which deal with the same feelings. There are MANY films out there which deal with the issues of confliction between a person's same-sex desires, and religious beliefs.With most of those films, I have been left either feeling outcast for having same-sex attractions, or feeling that my religious beliefs had been mocked. This film however is the first of it's kind which I have seen, which offers an honest and fair approach to both issues. It doesn't seek to indoctrinate the viewer in either direction.The connection between love and forgiveness leads to the idea that whatever life we live, in order to find real, true love, we must first find forgiveness. Forgiveness of ourselves for things we feel we have done, and perhaps even forgiving God for at least what we think he has done to us.To be fair to ourselves, we must come to terms with both sides rather than turning to one and disposing of the other from our life. But can this really be done? Only you the viewer can make that decision for yourself. This film however gives some thought provoking challenges to finding that place of fairness and honesty with oneself. The rest is up to you.I am not at all regretful for making this purchase. The film is well done, the acting is for the most part very good as is the picture and sound quality, casting, etc.. It isn't top notch, but it held my attention all the way through and didn't make me feel I wasted my time or money with it. I found it both entertaining and thought provoking.",4,"A probing look at faith in God, and love for man.",1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,2965,"['will', 'not', 'try', 'offer', 'recommendation', 'way', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'everyone', 'must', 'determine', 'not', 'wish', 'view', 'DO', 'HOWEVER', 'feel', 'different', 'kind', 'review', 'necessary', 'film', 'viewpoint', 'no-one', 'else', 'be', 'offering', 'Perhaps', 'side', 'no-one', 'else', 'have', 'caught', 'most', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'film', 'hate', 'middle', 'ground', 'thus', 'give', 'review', 'add', 'mix.Ryan', 'Mark', 'Cirillo', 'student', 'final', 'semester', 'seminary', 'studies', 'complete', 'solid', 'theological', 'thesis', 'order', 'continue', 'studies', 'university', 'choice', 'receive', 'grade', 'thesis', 'must', 'be', 'solid', 'factual', 'based', 'biblical', 'beliefs', 'not', 'just', 'personal', 'feelings', 'Ryan', 'also', 'gay', 'struggling', 'feelings', 'desire', 'stay', 'true', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'Can', 'convince', 'professor', 'full', 'understanding', 'subject', 'thesis', 'Divine', 'Gift', 'Love', 'film', 'directed', 'Joshua', 'Lim', 'based', 'own', 'life', 'lives', 'other', 'students', 'met', 'seminary', 'studies', 'interesting', 'reading', 'online', 'Joshua', 'Lim', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'film', 'can', 'find', 'easily', 'Google', 'read', 'reviews', 'movie', 'everything', 'inside', 'told', 'move', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'However', 'subject', 'matter', 'intrigued', 'reason', 'bit', 'more', 'other', 'films', 'deal', 'same', 'feelings', 'are', 'MANY', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'deal', 'issues', 'confliction', 'person', 'same-sex', 'desires', 'religious', 'beliefs.With', 'most', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'feeling', 'outcast', 'having', 'same-sex', 'attractions', 'feeling', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'had', 'been', 'mocked', 'film', 'however', 'first', 'kind', 'have', 'seen', 'honest', 'fair', 'approach', 'issues', ""n't"", 'seek', 'indoctrinate', 'viewer', 'direction.The', 'connection', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'leads', 'idea', 'life', 'live', 'order', 'find', 'real', 'true', 'love', 'must', 'first', 'find', 'forgiveness', 'Forgiveness', 'ourselves', 'things', 'feel', 'have', 'done', 'perhaps', 'even', 'forgiving', 'God', 'least', 'what', 'think', 'done', 'us.To', 'be', 'fair', 'ourselves', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'sides', 'rather', 'turning', 'one', 'disposing', 'other', 'life', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'done', 'Only', 'viewer', 'can', 'make', 'decision', 'film', 'however', 'thought', 'provoking', 'challenges', 'finding', 'place', 'fairness', 'honesty', 'rest', 'up', 'you.I', 'am', 'not', 'regretful', 'making', 'purchase', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'good', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'casting', 'etc..', ""n't"", 'top', 'notch', 'held', 'attention', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'wasted', 'time', 'money', 'found', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking']",The Seminarian

It's a tedious meditation on the angst of gay christians, without having anything original to say on the subject.  It's certainly well-intentioned, but also mind-numbingly, at times even hilariously earnest.  The dialogue is gratingly banal and predictable, though several of the actors frequently don't seem to understand their own lines.  The pace is glacial.  And, most annoyingly, the characters rarely speak face-to-face when a phone call will suffice.  So watching the movie is a bit like working for a few hours at a call centre.  If you're a gay christian in need of affirmation, then skip this and watch Prayers For Bobby.

In addition, while the cast, to me, was superb, the story-line wasn't. I felt that it was a pity the producers did not take the opportunity to beef up the maturity level of the gay characters - this was not the stereotypical, party-drugs-and-sex gay setting so, I just don't understand why the gay characters were not given greater depth, e.g. for the protagonist, who's a seminarian steeped in the quest for transcendental knowledge, to fall head over heels for a player like the character, Bradley, was difficult to watch. That kind of folly would have been more typical of a shallow, Hollywood wannabe but I certainly wouldn't expect that of a supposedly level-headed, deep-thinking seminarian. The message I got from this depiction of unrequited love seemed to be : ""When it comes to love, gay men, whether they're preachers or party boys, are still ruled by their dicks"". But, who doesn't already perceive that, right?
