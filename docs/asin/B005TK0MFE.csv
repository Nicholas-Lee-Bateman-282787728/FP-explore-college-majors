I kept trying to find a reason to give it at least two stars: a few of the jokes worked, a few of the unintentionally funny bits were funnier than the jokes, but the movie kept exceeding each new low.Victor Webster bores as the least exciting (or interesting) Mathayus.  (He spends a surprising amount of time for an action hero lying dazed upon his backside.)Bostin Christopher (Olaf, an l too far IMHO) makes us groan as the least funny sidekick.Krystal Vee (Silda) is given precious little to work with in making her the least interesting love interest.Ron Perlman (Horus) grimaces through the entire movie looking like he wants to kill someone,... presumably his agent for getting him into this mess.Only Billy Zane (Talus) seems to be truly enjoying himself,... but that could be the wine if he was drinking the real stuff.  (Actually, Zane is the only one completely at ease with parodying himself; the other poor suckers seem to have believed they were in a serious movie....  They were mistaken.)The plot, and I use the term loosely here, has the good guys spending most of the movie KNOWINGLY fighting among themselves, which makes it so much easier for Talus to waltz in and take over.  Frankly, the movie doesn't get serious until a victorious Talus unleashes three undead warriors using the Book of the Dead King Ramusan had done such a pathetic job of protecting....No, I lied; the movie doesn't really get serious then, either.  It is a measure of Director Roel Rein&eacute;'s incompetence that the climax, which involves Mathayus, Olaf, and Silda, all making their individual last stands against hopeless odds, is intercut so badly as to leave the viewer utterly confused about what is going on in each separate fight and largely uncaring about the outcomes.Finally, a bunch of talented martial artists got to put something really embarrassing on their resumes; one hopes they were at least well paid.Fearing it might be bad, I waited until it showed up in the last chance bargain bin clearance at a DVD rental price.Obviously, I didn't wait long enough.",1,A Scorpion King Too Far,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,2237,"['Theprequelof', 'asequelsurprised', 'being', 'great.Theprequelof', 'saidprequelsurprised', 'being', 'good.But', 'sequel', 'said', 'originalprequelhas', 'redeeming', 'value', 'whatsoever', 'kept', 'trying', 'find', 'reason', 'give', 'least', 'two', 'stars', 'few', 'jokes', 'worked', 'few', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'bits', 'were', 'funnier', 'jokes', 'movie', 'kept', 'exceeding', 'new', 'low.Victor', 'Webster', 'least', 'exciting', 'interesting', 'Mathayus', 'surprising', 'amount', 'time', 'action', 'hero', 'lying', 'dazed', 'backside', 'Christopher', 'Olaf', 'l', 'too', 'far', 'IMHO', 'groan', 'least', 'funny', 'sidekick.Krystal', 'Vee', 'Silda', 'given', 'precious', 'little', 'work', 'making', 'least', 'interesting', 'love', 'interest.Ron', 'Perlman', 'Horus', 'entire', 'movie', 'looking', 'kill', 'someone', 'presumably', 'agent', 'getting', 'mess.Only', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'Talus', 'be', 'truly', 'enjoying', 'could', 'be', 'wine', 'was', 'drinking', 'real', 'stuff', 'Actually', 'Zane', 'only', 'one', 'completely', 'ease', 'parodying', 'other', 'poor', 'suckers', 'seem', 'have', 'believed', 'were', 'serious', 'movie', 'were', 'mistaken', 'plot', 'use', 'term', 'loosely', 'here', 'good', 'guys', 'spending', 'most', 'movie', 'KNOWINGLY', 'fighting', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'Talus', 'waltz', 'take', 'over', 'Frankly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'get', 'serious', 'victorious', 'Talus', 'unleashes', 'three', 'undead', 'warriors', 'using', 'Book', 'Dead', 'King', 'Ramusan', 'had', 'done', 'pathetic', 'job', 'protecting', '.No', 'lied', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'serious', 'then', 'either', 'measure', 'Director', 'Roel', 'Rein', 'eacute', 'incompetence', 'climax', 'Mathayus', 'Olaf', 'Silda', 'making', 'individual', 'last', 'stands', 'hopeless', 'odds', 'intercut', 'so', 'badly', 'leave', 'viewer', 'utterly', 'confused', 'what', 'going', 'separate', 'fight', 'largely', 'uncaring', 'outcomes.Finally', 'bunch', 'talented', 'martial', 'artists', 'got', 'put', 'something', 'really', 'embarrassing', 'resumes', 'one', 'were', 'least', 'well', 'paid.Fearing', 'might', 'be', 'bad', 'waited', 'showed', 'up', 'last', 'chance', 'bargain', 'bin', 'clearance', 'DVD', 'rental', 'price.Obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'wait', 'long', 'enough']",The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption

Well, this film must have raided that warehouse. I saw costumes, swords, sets, gold chalices from every era and movie ever made. Yes, another Book of the Dead prop.(2.) And, the costumes had that cheap, machine cut and patterned, faux leather look with lots of big brassy baubles that have no value other than to look shiny to Magpies that like to collect them for nesting. I wonder if the fashion design students that are hired have any historical or practical knowledge of the period/subject.(3.) The script seemed like a melt between 21st century urban jargon and script writers that have watched too many early 20th century B movies about ancient Romans, Greeks, Mesopotamians, whatever with their pretend period language. My favorite line was ""Death to the invaders!"" How many movies have we heard that line from?(4.) What can one say about the acting other than they must have had a week to fill, or it's the usual Willis over-the-hill just show up and regurgitate my stereotype acting.(5.) Directing, and this is great, just one example. Around 13 minutes into the film our two heros attack a campsite of thieves; needless to say, lots of really bad fighting scenes. So, the bad guys get tossed into the campfire which happens to be heating a metal pot propped between two poles. The bad guys thrash around destroying the pot and fire and run off, also on fire. The very next scene we see our two conquering heros admiring how they pummeled the thieves and guess what is standing right next to them?

The basic idea is that he ends up being a hired mercenary for hire, which takes a suicide mission for a ton of gold if he succeeds. The movie ends up being predictable at the key moments, but the fighting is cool.Whoever they hired to create the CG for this movie certainly tried, but ultimately failed as the CG is pretty bad. At the start you see a city where you can clearly make out the art background (You see dried chipped paint) which takes you right out of the movie. Another instance is where you see a prosthetic on someone that is so clearly fake which makes you think who was behind the scenes making these things.Only the few key people in the story had ok acting (Ron Pearlman had good acting, which makes me wonder why he choose to work for this movie), but for the most part you felt like they were trying too hard to be the parts and not feel out the characters and become one with them. It's not enough to take you out of the movie (enough of that already), but still subpar for a movie that has ties to the Mummy.The fighting was really only the cool parts in this movie. Most of it is pretty cheesy, but it's by no means hard to watch. I say only buy this movie if it ends up in the five dollar bin, and maybe think about it if it happens to be 10 dollars.

1503449,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005TK0MFE,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[10, 13]","Exotic looking Victor Webster has assumed the title role taking over in a mostly deadpan fashion. The Akkadian king has fallen from grace and is now on a quest from King Horus (Ron Perlman in a minor role) to go after his rival brother Talus (Billy Zane). Talus is on the march against Horus' ally in the eastern kingdom (India) in order to obtain the ""Book of the Dead.""Webster is forced to work with the oafish Olaf (Bostin Christopher) from northern Germania. He has a wife Olga and 17 daughters. There are many stereotypes and if I started in on how this film is an anachronistic and  historical nightmare, I would be writing a tome after the first 10 minutes. The movie takes on the aspect of a ""B"" comedy by adapting modern sayings to its age. For instance, a prisoner gets his ear ripped off by Talus who then holds the ear to his mouth and says, ""Might you hear me now?""The movie is dotted with this type of humor.Dave Bautista plays Argomael the head of the Indian group. They also speak English but with an accent unlike the Akkadians, Egyptians (?), and the frequently belching Olaf. There is a fourth party in this...a person named ""Cobra."" Krystal Vee, a trained Thai kick boxer, plays the princess who must be rescued. Lex de Groot, who plays a messenger, is also listed as Billy Zane's stunt double, although I couldn't tell when he needed one.There is a quest within a quest, an oriental harem, a blond Japanese warrior, and ninja style warriors complete with cg ninja action. Billy Zane was excellent as the bad guy. The movie works when it is a ""B"" comedy. The serious scenes highlight the bad script and acting. Some of the fight scenes had me scratching my head such as when fighters ""ride"" elephant tusks to propel them 2-3 feet in the air across the span of 5 feet. They had to slow-mo the scene to make it look effective. It might have been better deleted. The movie was intended for a younger audience. If you keep your expectations low, view the movie within its context, and simply want an enjoyable film without it being an epic or requiring a lot of thinking, then this would be a worthwhile teen rental.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Use of ""P"" word. Urination. Krystal Vee showing off leg and midriff.

Now I'll be the first to admit that you can enjoy a good bad movie.  And some people will enjoy this movie along those lines alone.  There are some funny quips (not moments, mind you, but quips) that the characters make (because just about everyone is a comedian in this movie) throughout the film.  Most are of the groan inducing varieties but there are a few chucklers such as when Olaf, the brutish and dim sidekick to Mathayus our hero, cracks wise about Mathayus' neatly groomed quaf and then says while Mathayus fights flirtatiously with heroine Silda, ""Man, I don't know who's hair is prettier!""  From the wild overacting of Ron Perlman as horse-faced King Horus (man, that dude has a chin!) to Billy Zane's goth-inspired King Talus, no line of dialogue is left unchewed.  This is camp that was filmed to be camp and appeal to guys...mostly between the ages of 12-16.  They'll probably like it and truth to tell it's also pretty tame despite the scenes of death and carnage on the battlefield (none of it is gruesome though the scenes where elephants are lying strewn around with spears poking out of them might bother some).
