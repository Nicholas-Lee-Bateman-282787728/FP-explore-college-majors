1185696,A18ZDBQ8LUNVO6,B001EGJ30C,Jessica McCormick,"[2, 2]","I loved this show as a child, and I was ecstatic to find the series on DVD.  Though a little dated in one or two ideals, ""David the Gnome"" is a wonderful cartoon for children, and helps you teach them good morals.  The set even includes an episode of ""Dogtanian""!My only complaints about this DVD set is that the song accompanying the end credits has been changed, and the montage accompanying the intro music has been changed.  Why was this necessary?  The song accompanying the end credits is supposed to be a musical version of the intro; I always loved listening to it.  If anyone wants to hear what the original sounded like, or what the original montage looked like, you can always find it on youtube.  This way you know what your children are missing out on.",4,"5 Stars for the Show, 4 Stars for the DVDs",1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,765,"['loved', 'show', 'child', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'find', 'series', 'DVD', 'little', 'dated', 'one', 'two', 'ideals', 'David', 'Gnome', 'wonderful', 'cartoon', 'children', 'teach', 'good', 'morals', 'set', 'even', 'episode', 'Dogtanian', 'only', 'complaints', 'DVD', 'set', 'song', 'accompanying', 'end', 'credits', 'been', 'changed', 'montage', 'accompanying', 'intro', 'music', 'been', 'changed', 'Why', 'was', 'necessary', 'song', 'accompanying', 'end', 'credits', 'supposed', 'be', 'musical', 'version', 'intro', 'always', 'loved', 'listening', 'anyone', 'hear', 'what', 'original', 'sounded', 'what', 'original', 'montage', 'looked', 'can', 'always', 'find', 'youtube', 'way', 'know', 'what', 'children', 'are', 'missing', 'out']",The Adventures of David the Gnome (3 Disc Box Set)-Nick Jr
