But what I always check on every movie are the performances and acting. I think that TOM HANKS was more of a retard than European from BULGARIA, I think. CATHERINE ZETA JONES' performance was, different than others like from TRAFFIC or CHICAGO. STANLEY TUCCI was great too. I think the movie itself has a little boring parts. If you like those kind of movies where there is romantic touches and different plots at the same time, then you'll love this one. I liked it. Not that crazy about it either. I just liked it very much, but it has its ups and downs, you know. I'm not gonna say any plots points. I never do. O.K. That's it.

623750,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JMYC,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 10]","What was the reason for Spielberg to make this film?  Was it to showcase how well he works with Tom Hanks?  Or was it because he wanted to force audiences into a theater (or Video Store) to pay to watch him sell out and build a very forced film?  I would have to go with a combination of the two.  Now, I will say that Spielberg's eye is one of the best in the industry.  He continually raises the bar for each film that he makes (see Minority Report and Saving Private Ryan), but for some odd reason with The Terminal it feels like he didn't even have a bar he was trying to reach.  The forced feeling of everything that happens around Tom Hanks from the unlit flame of Catherine Zeta-Jones, to a fallible in-flight wedding, to even the corny climax when a character decides to play chicken with the plane, it doesn't seem to work.  Even Hanks' accent is poor.  It felt as if I was watching Spielberg's table scraps from other films fall down on the floor and get gobbled up by the projector.  This film just didn't work.  There was not one scene in this film that I can say I enjoyed.  Let me explain.Hanks was Hanks.  What more can we expect from him.  I do not believe he did anything above and beyond his normal call of duty in this film.  I never felt like I saw Viktor in Hanks.  All I could see was Hanks with a terrible accent.  Whether learned or created, the words that came out of Hanks' mouth seemed like rubbish.  It felt more like audience-cute instead of a definite control of the words.  Perhaps it was just me, but it felt as if Hanks learned English exceptionally fast.  Strange, but this was a huge plot-hole that Spielberg left wide open for us to fall into.  Outside of Hanks (being Hanks), there was Zeta-Jones who chose to go with the ""bimbo"" slant with her character.  She seemed ditzy, dull, and completely unfocused in this film.  Her chemistry with Tom Hanks seemed completely plastic and created.  There was nothing between them that said to me that they were a match made in heaven.  While others will argue that Spielberg had them in the film to show two sides of living in an airport (the literal and the figurative), I thought that it was a cheap shot to guide in female viewers.  What a better way to do so than with a forced romance.  It makes me laugh just typing about it.  Second, was Tucci even a villain?  Along the same lines as my Zeta-Jones comment, there was not enough character or structure for me to even believe Tucci as a bad airport director.  One moment he is asking Viktor for help and another time is yelling at him.  These two characters had about as much consistency as oatmeal.  Oddly, this was the general feeling of this film.Outside of the characters, the major flaw in this film is the story.  By the second hour of the film we have lost all hope in our characters and fearless director that we don't care what happens to anyone.  Viktor's dramatic conclusion is overshadowed by the two hours of garbage that had been slowly piling up.  I couldn't get excited or care what was going to happen next in this film, and that is a sign that something is doomed.  I continued to get a sense of claustrophobia, wondering if Spielberg would finally take Hanks out of the airport and build upon something new and fresh.  Alas, that never happened.  Instead, we are forced to repeat the same steps over and over again in a way that almost makes you nauseated.  Did Spielberg have a goal or vision with this film, or was it just made up along the way?  Also, was his editor on vacation?  I realize that his epics are normally long, but this one just seemed to drag beyond belief.  I needed something, actually anything to keep my attention in this film, and yet nothing arrived.  It felt like opening that Christmas present that you think is what you really want, but instead it is just socks.  Boy, don't you feel let down?Overall, I was highly disappointed with this film.  When I see a Spielberg film I expect to be blown away by sharp images, infallible characters, and a compassionate story.  He has built so much notoriety on his name and style of film alone that there is a certain expectation when going to see one of his films.  I do not feel it is bad to request these three elements in his pictures.  Sadly, in The Terminal I saw nothing of the sort.  It was as if Spielberg was attempting to just create a big clich&eacute; instead of a film.  It was as if he was doing the complete opposite from what he normally does.  In this film he had shoddy images, underdeveloped and lost characters, and a repetitive repulsive story.  I do not recommend this film for anyone that is a fan of Spielberg's work.  It will only bring a tear to your eye.Grade: ** out of *****",2,"One man, two women; crowded.",1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,4724,"['What', 'was', 'reason', 'Spielberg', 'make', 'film', 'Was', 'showcase', 'how', 'well', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'wanted', 'force', 'audiences', 'theater', 'Video', 'Store', 'pay', 'watch', 'sell', 'out', 'build', 'very', 'forced', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'combination', 'two', 'Now', 'will', 'say', 'Spielberg', 'eye', 'one', 'best', 'industry', 'continually', 'bar', 'film', 'see', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'odd', 'reason', 'Terminal', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'bar', 'was', 'trying', 'reach', 'forced', 'feeling', 'everything', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'unlit', 'flame', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'fallible', 'in-flight', 'wedding', 'even', 'corny', 'climax', 'when', 'character', 'play', 'chicken', 'plane', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'Even', 'Hanks', 'accent', 'poor', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'Spielberg', 'table', 'scraps', 'other', 'films', 'fall', 'down', 'floor', 'get', 'gobbled', 'up', 'projector', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Let', 'explain.Hanks', 'was', 'Hanks', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'expect', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'did', 'anything', 'normal', 'call', 'duty', 'film', 'never', 'felt', 'saw', 'Viktor', 'Hanks', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'Hanks', 'terrible', 'accent', 'Whether', 'learned', 'created', 'words', 'came', 'Hanks', 'mouth', 'seemed', 'rubbish', 'felt', 'more', 'audience-cute', 'instead', 'definite', 'control', 'words', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'felt', 'Hanks', 'learned', 'English', 'exceptionally', 'fast', 'Strange', 'was', 'huge', 'plot-hole', 'Spielberg', 'left', 'wide', 'open', 'fall', 'Hanks', 'being', 'Hanks', 'was', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'chose', 'go', 'bimbo', 'slant', 'character', 'seemed', 'ditzy', 'dull', 'completely', 'unfocused', 'film', 'chemistry', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'seemed', 'completely', 'plastic', 'created', 'was', 'nothing', 'said', 'were', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'others', 'will', 'argue', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'film', 'show', 'two', 'sides', 'living', 'airport', 'literal', 'figurative', 'thought', 'was', 'cheap', 'shot', 'guide', 'female', 'viewers', 'What', 'better', 'way', 'do', 'so', 'forced', 'romance', 'laugh', 'just', 'typing', 'Second', 'was', 'Tucci', 'even', 'villain', 'same', 'lines', 'Zeta-Jones', 'comment', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'character', 'structure', 'even', 'believe', 'Tucci', 'bad', 'airport', 'director', 'One', 'moment', 'asking', 'Viktor', 'help', 'time', 'yelling', 'two', 'characters', 'had', 'as', 'much', 'consistency', 'oatmeal', 'Oddly', 'was', 'general', 'feeling', 'film.Outside', 'characters', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'story', 'second', 'hour', 'film', 'have', 'lost', 'hope', 'characters', 'fearless', 'director', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anyone', 'Viktor', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'overshadowed', 'two', 'hours', 'garbage', 'had', 'been', 'slowly', 'piling', 'up', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'excited', 'care', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'film', 'sign', 'something', 'doomed', 'continued', 'get', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'wondering', 'Spielberg', 'would', 'finally', 'take', 'Hanks', 'airport', 'build', 'something', 'new', 'fresh', 'Alas', 'never', 'happened', 'Instead', 'are', 'forced', 'repeat', 'same', 'steps', 'over', 'again', 'way', 'almost', 'nauseated', 'Did', 'Spielberg', 'have', 'goal', 'vision', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'made', 'up', 'way', 'Also', 'was', 'editor', 'vacation', 'realize', 'epics', 'are', 'normally', 'long', 'one', 'just', 'seemed', 'drag', 'belief', 'needed', 'something', 'actually', 'anything', 'keep', 'attention', 'film', 'yet', 'nothing', 'arrived', 'felt', 'opening', 'Christmas', 'present', 'think', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'instead', 'just', 'socks', 'Boy', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'let', 'down', 'Overall', 'was', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'film', 'When', 'see', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'expect', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'sharp', 'images', 'infallible', 'characters', 'compassionate', 'story', 'built', 'so', 'much', 'notoriety', 'name', 'style', 'film', 'alone', 'certain', 'expectation', 'when', 'going', 'see', 'one', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'bad', 'request', 'three', 'elements', 'pictures', 'Sadly', 'Terminal', 'saw', 'nothing', 'sort', 'was', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'attempting', 'just', 'create', 'big', 'clich', 'eacute', 'instead', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'doing', 'complete', 'opposite', 'what', 'normally', 'film', 'had', 'shoddy', 'images', 'underdeveloped', 'lost', 'characters', 'repetitive', 'repulsive', 'story', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'fan', 'Spielberg', 'work', 'will', 'only', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye.Grade', '**', '*****']",N/A

Remember the opening sequence of The Player where film producer Tim Robbins listened to a series of preposterous one-sentence ideas for movies?  Here goes.  ""Man entering JFK from failed state must take up residence in waiting area, existing in a state of limbo - hyjinx ensue.""  The idea is just so breathtakingly stupid and far-fetched that it's a wonder Spielberg gave it a second thought.  However, if nothing else, Spielberg is good at movie magic, and here he has taken an abominable idea, an anemic script, and dressed them up with enough flotsam and jetsam to not lose money.How did he do it?  Well, start with Tom Hanks, as bankable as you get.  You simply can't dislike Tom Hanks, because there's nothing there to dislike.  Of course, there's nothing there to like either.  He's like a loaf of Wonderbread, the ideal ""everyman"" actor - so totally nondescript that he slips into any role.  Heck, Spielberg doesn't even make him speak English!  Add Catherine Zeta Jones.  Fellas, I don't know about you, but I would watch her in a dog food commercial.  Make sure to add plenty of glamour location footage and production value, not to mention those all-important product placements.  Then finish off with a really top shelf set of minor characters led by Kumar Pallana who nearly steals the film.  (Remember him in 10 Items or Less?)  In other words, if you've got enough tinsel, no one will notice that there is no tree.Even the great Stanley Tucci cannot make anything out of his part - and I have seen him work miracles with much less.  He's totally wasted.  The sentimentality and bleary-eyed romanticism function on the 12-year old girl level we've come to associate with Spielberg, there are moments in this film so cloying one expects to see subtitles reading, ""Cry now"".

Tom hanks plays oour main character Victor from Karcoisha (i know thats spelled wrong but you try spelling it from memory)who cant go home because his country is besieged by war and his gov't has fallen, leaving him with no valid citizenship and ability to step foot on american soil.  So with no place to go, Victor is left to live in the airport where he must find out how to get food, cloths and all the necessities of live w/o ever leaving.This movie is hillarious with how Tom Hank plays a foreiner who must learn his english by translating a Friends magazine written in french, to ine in english.  Not being the only hllairious antic but Victor (played by Tom) must also make money by retunring carts to a station which rewards it's bringer with a shiny quarter...so cart by cart...quarter by quarter victor earns his money to eat a Burger King.  Talk about desperate to all those who hate fast food! ^_^But food is not the only thing on youg victors mind...during his stay at JFK airport he runs into a beautiful woman whom he falls in love with, but unfortantly to my distaste he nver actually get with her, she instaed goes with another man whom is cheating on hos wife....talk about let down....thats the only thing i didnt like about this movie was that....he doesnt get the girl...sigh...i watch too many chick flicks i guess.Anyways....there is one mystery about aour stranded foreigner that baffels, why does he carry around an old can of dry roosted peanuts in his bad?  It doesnt contian peanuts....so whats inside it?

623758,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JMYC,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","A lot of people consider Tom Hanks to be one of the greatest actors of his generation.  They laud his every performance, even the mediocre ones (and personally, I feel as though he has a lot of those).  I mean, the man has two Oscar's so OBVIOUSLY he's amazing, right.I am not a Hanks fan really.  I think that he has been superb twice (in `Big' and `Cast Away'), and merely adequate most other times.  In fact, I find his two Oscar winning performances to be near the bottom of his pile of performances, and I often find his ignored work to be his most inspired.  Why wasn't anyone paying attention to him when he delivered delicious line after line in `That Thing You Do' or when he stayed in step with Leonardo DiCaprio in `Catch Me if You Can'?  Why, instead, does he find himself nominated for boring and uneventful work like `Saving Private Ryan', or clich&eacute;d and flawed work like `Philadelphia'?  Personally, I find him to be highly overrated and overpraised.So, `The Terminal' was not very high on my list back in 2004.I actually happened to see this film because my mother-in-law is one of those delusional Hanks fans and so we took her to see this movie while my father-in-law was away on business.  Now, I will be honest right off the bat and tell you that this movie is rather ridiculous and that it is clich&eacute; ridden and completely unoriginal even if the so-called `plot' is original, but...and there is a but...Tom Hanks completely saves this movie from being forgettable and worthless.  Yes, this is one of his best performances.It's sad that this is one of his worst movies.The film tells the `inspired by a true story yet nothing like the true story it was inspired by' story of Viktor Navorski, a middle-aged man who travels to New York from his home country in order to do something `mysterious'.  While in the air his country goes to war and he walks off the plane a citizen of no where.  Without legal citizenship he becomes a citizen of the airport, unable to fly home and unable to take a step on American soil.  He makes a home for himself at the airport, making friends, getting work, falling in love; all the while the head of security, Frank Dixon, is desperately trying to get rid of him.The plot is preposterous.  There is so much that goes on here that makes no sense whatsoever it's almost as if the screen writer just gave up trying to make this believable.  Between Viktor's sudden grasp of English to his remodeling of the airport, not a whole lot here is even remotely plausible.  That's kind of sad, because this had the potential to be a really smart and really touching drama.  Instead it is nothing but a clich&eacute;d, unrealistic kinda-sorta romantic comedy.The performances, outside of Hanks, are merely serviceable, but I blame the scripting for that.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is quirky and somewhat adorable, but the script doesn't give her real room to flourish, which is sad because this could have been a prime role for her.  Stanley Tucci is spot on as the tyrant Dixon, but the film's final scene with him is contradictory (he is not painted as a playful cat and mouse type adversary, he's painted as a real creep, so his nonchalant attitude at the films end is out of place).  The supporting players like Chi McBride and Diego Luna and Kumar Pallana and Zoe Saldana aren't really given much to do except clich&eacute;d one-liners and implausible plot points.  Luna and Saldana's romance is ridiculous to say the least, and while Pallana is hilarious in every scene he is in, he winds up being nothing but a walking stereotype.Yes, Tom Hanks is really the only reason to see this movie.  He has a wonderful grasp of who Viktor is, and he makes us want to root for him, want to rally behind and support him.  We fall in love with him, just as Amelia obviously does, and we understand why (because, obviously, we are not Frank Dixon).  He has the `Romantic Comedy' charm, but he backs it up with a dramatic reality that gives weight to his character, even if the script is uninterested in giving him any.Yes, `The Terminal' is entertaining.  It has wit and ample amounts of charm, but I can't help but think of how much better this could have been if they hadn't gotten lazy with it.",3,"As a whole the film makes very little sense, but Hanks works a magic I very rarely see from him...",1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,4240,"['lot', 'people', 'consider', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'generation', 'laud', 'performance', 'even', 'mediocre', 'ones', 'personally', 'feel', 'lot', 'mean', 'man', 'two', 'Oscar', 'so', 'OBVIOUSLY', 'amazing', 'right.I', 'am', 'not', 'Hanks', 'fan', 'really', 'think', 'been', 'superb', 'twice', 'Big', 'Cast', 'Away', 'merely', 'adequate', 'most', 'other', 'times', 'fact', 'find', 'two', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performances', 'be', 'bottom', 'pile', 'performances', 'often', 'find', 'ignored', 'work', 'be', 'most', 'inspired', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'paying', 'attention', 'when', 'delivered', 'delicious', 'line', 'line', 'Thing', 'Do', 'when', 'stayed', 'step', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'Why', 'instead', 'find', 'nominated', 'boring', 'uneventful', 'work', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'flawed', 'work', 'Philadelphia', 'Personally', 'find', 'be', 'highly', 'overrated', 'Terminal', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'high', 'list', 'back', '2004.I', 'actually', 'happened', 'see', 'film', 'mother-in-law', 'one', 'delusional', 'Hanks', 'fans', 'so', 'took', 'see', 'movie', 'father-in-law', 'was', 'away', 'business', 'Now', 'will', 'be', 'honest', 'right', 'bat', 'tell', 'movie', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridden', 'completely', 'unoriginal', 'even', 'so-called', 'plot', 'original', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'completely', 'movie', 'being', 'forgettable', 'worthless', 'Yes', 'one', 'best', 'performances.It', 'sad', 'one', 'worst', 'movies.The', 'film', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'yet', 'nothing', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'inspired', 'story', 'Viktor', 'Navorski', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'home', 'country', 'order', 'do', 'something', 'mysterious', 'air', 'country', 'war', 'walks', 'off', 'plane', 'citizen', 'where', 'legal', 'citizenship', 'citizen', 'airport', 'unable', 'fly', 'home', 'unable', 'take', 'step', 'American', 'soil', 'home', 'airport', 'making', 'friends', 'getting', 'work', 'falling', 'love', 'head', 'security', 'Frank', 'Dixon', 'desperately', 'trying', 'get', 'rid', 'him.The', 'plot', 'preposterous', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'sense', 'almost', 'screen', 'writer', 'just', 'gave', 'up', 'trying', 'make', 'believable', 'Between', 'Viktor', 'sudden', 'grasp', 'English', 'remodeling', 'airport', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'here', 'even', 'remotely', 'plausible', 'kind', 'sad', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'really', 'smart', 'really', 'touching', 'drama', 'Instead', 'nothing', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'unrealistic', 'kinda-sorta', 'romantic', 'comedy.The', 'performances', 'Hanks', 'are', 'merely', 'serviceable', 'blame', 'scripting', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'quirky', 'somewhat', 'adorable', 'script', ""n't"", 'give', 'real', 'room', 'flourish', 'sad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'prime', 'role', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'spot', 'tyrant', 'Dixon', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'contradictory', 'not', 'painted', 'playful', 'cat', 'mouse', 'type', 'adversary', 'painted', 'real', 'creep', 'nonchalant', 'attitude', 'films', 'end', 'place', 'supporting', 'players', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'Kumar', 'Pallana', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'clich', 'eacute', 'one-liners', 'implausible', 'plot', 'points', 'Luna', 'Saldana', 'romance', 'ridiculous', 'say', 'least', 'Pallana', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'up', 'being', 'nothing', 'walking', 'stereotype.Yes', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'grasp', 'who', 'Viktor', 'want', 'root', 'want', 'rally', 'support', 'fall', 'love', 'just', 'Amelia', 'obviously', 'understand', 'why', 'obviously', 'are', 'not', 'Frank', 'Dixon', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'charm', 'up', 'dramatic', 'reality', 'weight', 'character', 'even', 'script', 'uninterested', 'giving', 'any.Yes', 'Terminal', 'entertaining', 'wit', 'ample', 'amounts', 'charm', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'lazy']",N/A

While I will not disclose any spoilers, I can say that there are a few odds and ends, some twists and turns that come out of the blue and might even make you applaud Spielberg for not overusing some typical Hollywood clich&eacute;s.  Hanks, on the other side of the camera, continues to tackle tough roles and does so superbly.  This was not an easy task, playing a man without a country, a foreigner who must learn English in an airport terminal (along with live, eat, shower, and try to find a job there).Hanks comes from Krakoshia, a country bordering Russia, which has just suffered a military coup... while he was in the air!  The U.S. does not recognize the new government yet, so without a passport or visa, he is stuck from going into America (New York City, to be precise) and from returning home.  Stanley Tucci plays the security administrator up for promotion who does not want this problem on his watch.  What can he do but watch, though?  His hands are tied, it's a crack in the system, and Hanks is ""unacceptable"" anywhere.It is a comedy, no mistake about that.  It's also a light-hearted drama with a smattering of romance tossed in.  Hanks interracts with a colorful ensemble of airport employees and their own various life stories.  The consequences are hilarious and the play between them is exacting and charming.  Zeta-Jones steps out of her typical ""I'm-better-than-you"" style and role to prove she can act outside her typecasting.  Her role is nothing short of totally unique; imagine her finally playing a truly flawed character!  It was refreshing to see.True, Hanks once again picks up the role for the grand hero with a dilemma, but he's tried and tested and proven himself capable in the past.  This time, he's doing it with a Krakoshian accent.  He plays the part flawlessly; in the end, we really do believe him and isn't that the point of acting, to establish credibility?A solid script, a great plot, a well-assembled cast, a fresh new look from the director, and solid acting all around make this one of the better movies to hit the screens in a while.  Makes one wonder why they didn't wait until December for Oscar votes.  Will it pick up nominations?  It's too early to tell, but I could definitely see this movie in contention for one of the five illustrious slots (and possibly even winning!).

Between the time he leaves home and the time Hanks arrives in the airport at NYC his homeland has undergone a military coup.  This means that according to US customs rules Navorski's visa is no longer valid and he is therefore not allowed to enter the USA.  It also means that he has no home to return to that is recognized by the USA, plus all of his homeland's borders are closed.Navorski becomes the problem of the local customs official played seamlessly by Tucci.  Tucci sees Hanks as a minor irritation, but as days turn into weeks, and weeks to months, Tucci reaches his wits end.

He's better here than in ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Green Mile,"" and more persevering than in ""Catch Me If You Can."" It is a movie that's easy to miss, but worth catching. Spielberg milks his skills as a sentimentalist, and gives us a satisfying time at the theater.Calling it an intellectual movie is going too far, but it definitely is a thinking man's comedy. If outlined into a genre, it might fall into a situation comedy. Summing it up to ""A man is confined to an airport terminal, and laughs ensue as he tries to get by day-to-day,"" would miss the layers of characterization and plot. The comedy evolves and unfolds slowly as we relate to Hanks and the troupe of airport employees who support or hinder him in his plight.Tom Hanks is Viktor Navorski. He's flown in from his home, an Eastern European country, which suffers a coup while Viktor is on a plane to New York City. His mission is to acquire the autograph from a legendary jazz sax player to complete his late father's collection. Because of the coup, however, Viktor has his passport and related travel papers taken away. He becomes as stranded in an international airport terminal as he was in ""Castaway."" Through Viktor's attempts to resolve his quandary, we see Hanks sounding more Russian than Robin Williams as Vladimir Ivanoff in ""Moscow on the Hudson,"" convincing us he is truly from the fictional country, Krakozhia.As in ""Castaway,"" Viktor improvises humorously to create an environment in which he can live. With tools left by construction workers and tradesmen, he rebuilds a wall, creates a Napoleonesque fountain and he finds a niche within the terminal that has gone unnoticed that he uses for a bedroom. He manages relationships with airport employees. In one situation, he sets up a food worker with an immigration official in trade for a meal. In another, he shows Amelia by example not all men are cheats.Drawbacks and oversights discourage plausibility at times. From the pratfalls Viktor takes when walking into windows, to the naive persona he displays, there is a surprising stereotype of the Eastern European simpleton. Hanks, and especially Spielberg should know better. Also, Viktor is quickly useful in one scene to help translate for a Russian traveler, but never during Viktor's stay is a translator found for him. NYC has every tongue known to man, and yet there is no one who speaks his language? Why doesn't Amelia ever inquire more about Viktor's life? I don't buy it. These holes should have been filled.Catherine Zeta-Jones as Amelia provides an average performance as a lonely flight attendant in a seven-year affair with a married man. Her on/off interest in Viktor as a subplot shows the romantic side of Hanks' character, but nothing of Jones. Being attractive isn't enough to give us much to feel compassionate about, or to care whether or not Viktor and she connect. We want Viktor to be happy, having such hapless luck foisted upon him, but she is only a means to that end.Frank Dixon, as played by Stanley Tucci, has a unique job as a foil to Viktor. As security chief, he's the one who oversees the airport's efficiency, mindful of the details that keep things both secure and peaceful. Viktor's presence is not welcome, but Frank has no legal options but to let him stay. We can't be sure if Frank wants to help Viktor or not, as he flops indecisively in his efforts to oust Viktor from the airport. Although Tucci could've played Frank better, his lines needed more work. His character came across as underutilized by the scriptwriters.Kumar Pallana plays Gupta Rajan, a janitor who cantankerously protects his job. When Viktor loses something in the garbage and tries to retrieve it, Gupta snorts, ""Do you have an appointment?"" Gupta is on the run from the Indian police and suspects everyone as being from the CIA. Pallana is funny with and without lines. His insidious smile as travelers trip and slide on a wet floor is as good as any John Belushi eyebrow lift.The movie is an appropriate Father's Day film, as Viktor's undaunted devotion to his father's dream is touching. Recognizing the subcultures and society of the unseen airport support staff is well-done when stereotypes aren't in force. In a post-9/11 era, and the rigid needs of airport security, the movie highlight the confounding struggle innocent immigrants and travelers must now endure in order to walk from no-man's land to the land of the free.I fully recommend ""The Terminal."" It has great DVD appeal, but seeing it on the big screen brings nothing special when compared to its competition of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Shrek 2."" However, when it lacks in special effects, it swells in thoughtful, timely humor and drama. Send the kids into see ""Harry,"" and hop into ""The Terminal."" It is no ""Schindler's List,"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Philadelphia Story,"" it is still a movie that will leave feeling good but not stupid.Anthony Trendleditor,

623773,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JMYC,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 7]","Victor Navorski (Tom Hanks) has just landed at JFK Airport. He's come from the fictional country of Krykozhia which had a sudden military coup while he was in the air; the country of Krykozhia no longer exists. His money is no good, his passport is useless, and he's not allowed to leave the airport until this mess gets cleared up.But how long will that take?Long enough for him to find and lose love, develop a handful of dedicated friends, and forge at least one bitter enemy.There are a couple of items that make for good cinema. #1 is a good script; #2 is good acting; and #3 is sets, costumes, and other props.Let's take these in reverse order so that I don't sound like a complete pessimist.#3: The sets, costumes, and props. They were quite excellent. The fact that an entire airport wing was constructed for the set of The Terminal was impressive. The filming of it was good, too. Tom Hanks wore the traditional suit found in Eastern Europe, while Catherine Zeta-Jones looked great in her tightly formed stewardess outfit.#2: Good acting. I think everyone did a good job. Not great, but good. Tom Hanks' pseudo-Russian style accent came across as very believable. His ""evil"" counterpart, played well by Stanley Tucci, comes off as acceptable if a bit shallow. Catherine Zeta-Jones, the ""love interest"" in the film, was interestingly flawed, but a bit too cardboardish and stereotyped. The other minor characters, too, were a tad one-dimensional with little thought given to their slight personalities.#1: The script. Here we're going to hit some turbulence. First, let's get into the premise of the film. It is true that occurrences of lost nationality have happened from time to time on our planet. But the U.S. (in particular) has been very accepting of these issues, and the INS would have been dispatched to deal with such an event, I'm sure. The fact that there weren't any behind-the-scenes bureaucratic actions taking place felt completely unrealistic.Secondly, the main issue of Tom Hanks' character's reason for coming to the States is not clearly understood until much too late in the film. He carries around a little peanut can with him and it's supposed to be mysterious to us movie-goers. But it seemed more irritating than suspenseful. And when Catherine Zeta-Jones finds out what's in the can, her tearful response came off as forced, and failed to elicit any kind of emotional response from me. I felt there should've been much more film time spent on ""The Mystery of the Peanut Can"" than was given. The ending, because of this oversight, was muddled and strained, and failed, again, to elicit the emotions that were intended by Mr. Spielberg (I personally believe that the film should've ended the minute he stepped out of The Terminal, which is what the film was all about in my opinion).Thirdly, although I enjoyed seeing Catherine Zeta-Jones whenever she was on camera---I mean, she's a damn fine looking lady---,her complete absence of anything remotely connected to the end of the film made me wonder why this character was even IN the movie. The weak (very weak) plot fix of having her be responsible for giving Tom Hanks the documents needed to get him out of the airport terminal, troubled me and made me wonder if any of the other half-dozen minor characters could've done the same---particularly the beautiful, black security lady that Victor (Hanks' character) bugs every day.What would've happened if there was no love interest for Victor Navorski? Supposed we ripped out the Catherine Zeta-Jones character altogether, and put that film time toward more understanding of the relationship between Victor Navorski, his father, the peanut can, and music?So all in all, a bit of a flop in the plotting and screenplay department; some steady acting and decent costumes, props, and sets. But not Spielberg's best film.

Don't waste your time with this one.It seems as if if they casted a lot of big name actors for this Hollywood flop of a movie and instead of writing an interesting plot that works, they just had the actors do their own usual things: Tom Hanks playing a bumbling Forest-Gump-of-a-guy down on his luck, Catherine Zeta Jones - the brainless but beautiful female character, a role I was relieved that she played very well in (usually her acting is so bad I try to stay away from movies starring her...), Stanley Tucci trying to make it big again at his job in running the airport operations at JFK airport, and Kumar Pallana playing himself, a stubborn old man, who portrays his role as ""class clown"" by performing juggling acts which really do not add to the plot and are really not that funny.The plot is so contrived and so full of holes that do not make any sense whatsoever. I fail to understand why a stewardess who has travelled the world around for 20 years and most likely finds it boring by now and who has waited a large portion of her life for a married loser of a guy would not want to start a new life with a man who builds her a beautiful work of art. Why wouldn't she say, ""I'm tired of waiting."" It just doesn't make any plain sense. It wouldn't have taken anything away from the movie. It would have actually have made the movie much much better and much more rewarding after watching  the 2 hours of crap.The writers totally missed the boat in trying to make a saccarine sweet depiction of life in an airport terminal that really has nothing to do with reality. Yes, there are nice people out there that do care about the folks around them, but there are also a lot of miserable jerks that do not give a darn. Take any airport and it'll be teeming with folks like that but to the 10th degree. Maybe the writers were trying to portray that negative aspect in the Stanley Tucci character, but then why do they have Tucci getting soap operic over Hanks' and Jones' relationship???? Where the heck does that come from and why would he even care? I do not understand.Yes, there is a lot of waiting in life, but there is a time when one will tire of waiting and say enough is enough. Another aspect of air travel that I think the writers failed to pick up on is that a lot of the times when things happen, like delays and cancellations, these are events that are out of the control of anyone's hands. A lot of the time, sh*t does happen and there is nothing that can be done about it but to travel down the path that life is taking you down now and make the best out of it. I think the writers would have made a stronger impact if they didn't try to steer away from the ugliness of life at an airport terminal.It's a shame that this movie could not have been better, or at least Steven Spielberg demanding for better writing, since Zeta Jones does a great job.I'm never listening to Roger Ebert again.

He plays a foreign visitor who finds himself without a country and ""unacceptable"" in the U.S. As a result, he must stay in the New York airport international lounge. As you can imagine, this provides a few challenges. How will he live? How will he make money? All of these are handled with sensibility.Hanks really makes you sympathize with his character. At the beginning, he is unable to understand very much English, and when he finally realizes why he is trapped in the airport (via a news broadcast) the shock he shows grabs your heart. Seeing him try to survive on crackers and ketchup and trying to sleep in terminal chairs makes you root for him. His evolution as a character really grows in a sensible way as he makes friends (and enemies of the Homeland Security director), and his grasp of English improves.The weak point of the movie is Catherine Zeta-Jones. Her tortured stewardess is really pretty weak. While you cheer Hanks on to get the girl, you find it hard to see why he'd want her. Still, their relationship provides for one of the more touching and funny scenes in the movie involving an outdoor dinner and spinning plates (see it to believe it).All in all, this is a great movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

But Viktor is on a quest, and must get to New York, so he waits. And waits. And waits.

This film could be an allegory about the resourcefulness of the American immigrant, or a condemnation of the ludicrous policies of the Department of Homeland Security, but it's a tad too bright and light for either. More than anything, the film expresses our willingness to wait for what is really important to us to be realized. And what better place to set a film about waiting than an roport.

When Navorski gets to JFK Airport in New York, he is informed that a political coup has occurred in his country while he was traveling, and now his passport is invalid. The head of security at JFK, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), informs him that he can neither leave, nor enter the United States, that he is unacceptable. Viktor, with limited comprehension of English, is confused by the fast-talking Dixon, but eventually gets the message that he is stuck here in the international travel lounge until things settle down back in Krakozhia.For Dixon's part, he'd rather let someone else worry about Navorski, and even offers to let him leave the airport, but Navorski refuses, following Dixon's early instruction that he must wait. Viktor takes up residence at Gate 67, which is in a part of the airport being renovated, and eventually picks up on the English language, and makes a few friends. These include Enrique (Diego Luna), who offers to feed Viktor in exchange for information about the woman he is infatuated with, Officer Torres (Zoe Saldana), who is the one to approve or deny access to America; Mulroy (Chi McBride), a baggage handler who runs a late-night poker game where they use unclaimed lost-and-found items instead of money; Gupta (Kumar Pallana), an Indian janitor suspicious that Navorski is a spy; and Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a flight attendant with a knack for finding hopeless men and falling hopelessly in love with them.There isn't really much plot to speak of, and that's fine, since the whole point of the film is to observe how a man deals with being stuck indefinitely in an international airport terminal. Tom Hanks is stellar as always, employing here a pretty good accent that doesn't distract. As long as these characters were interesting and believeable, I would have had no problem with The Terminal, but director Steven Spielberg infuses it with sap and contrivances that left me shaking my head. There are a couple of ridiculous subplots involving romance that, to me, were pretty worthless and didn't belong in the film.However, I was entertained by the film for the first half, at least. There were some very humorous moments, such as when Navorski figures out how to get himself some quick cash in a perfectly logical way. The characters, though, operated almost backwards from what happens in an ordinary film. And what I mean by that is that instead of starting out as stereotypes and gradually peeling away layers, these characters progressed towards stereotypes, so that by the end of the film, everyone is acting so irrationally that you just want to scream at the screen, ""You wouldn't really do that!""",2,"Starts out great, but becomes a train wreck with sap",1113004800,"04 9, 2005",2005,3200,"['Terminal', 'story', 'man', 'country', 'trapped', 'airport', 'indefinite', 'amount', 'time', 'out', 'innocently', 'enough', 'stride', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'then', 'midpoint', 'gradually', 'worse', 'worse', 'end', 'when', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'good', 'promise', 'shown', 'early', 'on.Tom', 'Hanks', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'American', 'everyman', 'actor', 'Viktor', 'Navorski', 'man', 'country', 'called', 'Krakozhia', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'film', 'purposes', 'eastern', 'Europe', 'When', 'Navorski', 'JFK', 'Airport', 'New', 'York', 'informed', 'political', 'coup', 'occurred', 'country', 'was', 'traveling', 'now', 'passport', 'invalid', 'head', 'security', 'JFK', 'Frank', 'Dixon', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'can', 'neither', 'leave', 'enter', 'United', 'States', 'unacceptable', 'Viktor', 'limited', 'comprehension', 'English', 'confused', 'fast-talking', 'Dixon', 'eventually', 'message', 'stuck', 'here', 'international', 'travel', 'lounge', 'things', 'settle', 'down', 'back', 'Krakozhia.For', 'Dixon', 'part', ""'d"", 'rather', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'worry', 'Navorski', 'even', 'offers', 'let', 'leave', 'airport', 'Navorski', 'following', 'Dixon', 'early', 'instruction', 'must', 'wait', 'Viktor', 'up', 'residence', 'Gate', '67', 'part', 'airport', 'being', 'renovated', 'eventually', 'up', 'English', 'language', 'few', 'friends', 'include', 'Enrique', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'who', 'feed', 'Viktor', 'exchange', 'information', 'woman', 'infatuated', 'Officer', 'Torres', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'who', 'one', 'approve', 'deny', 'access', 'America', 'Mulroy', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'baggage', 'handler', 'who', 'late-night', 'poker', 'game', 'where', 'use', 'unclaimed', 'lost-and-found', 'items', 'instead', 'money', 'Gupta', 'Kumar', 'Pallana', 'Indian', 'janitor', 'suspicious', 'Navorski', 'spy', 'Amelia', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'flight', 'attendant', 'knack', 'finding', 'hopeless', 'men', 'falling', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'them.There', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'plot', 'speak', 'fine', 'whole', 'point', 'film', 'observe', 'how', 'man', 'being', 'stuck', 'indefinitely', 'international', 'airport', 'terminal', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'stellar', 'always', 'employing', 'here', 'pretty', 'good', 'accent', ""n't"", 'distract', 'As', 'long', 'characters', 'were', 'interesting', 'believeable', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'problem', 'Terminal', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'sap', 'contrivances', 'left', 'shaking', 'head', 'are', 'couple', 'ridiculous', 'subplots', 'involving', 'romance', 'were', 'pretty', 'worthless', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'film.However', 'was', 'entertained', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'least', 'were', 'very', 'humorous', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'Navorski', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'quick', 'cash', 'perfectly', 'logical', 'way', 'characters', 'though', 'operated', 'almost', 'backwards', 'what', 'ordinary', 'film', 'what', 'mean', 'instead', 'starting', 'out', 'stereotypes', 'gradually', 'peeling', 'away', 'layers', 'characters', 'progressed', 'towards', 'stereotypes', 'end', 'film', 'everyone', 'acting', 'so', 'irrationally', 'just', 'want', 'scream', 'screen', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'do']",N/A

This could be frustrating since at times we want another serious masterpiece like Schindler's List or we just want a rollicking good time like Jurassic Park. So it's interesting in that the Terminal is neither in that he's more in an Always/E.T mode here, going for sentimentality and drama than thrills or gravitas. But this film is no E.T but then again it's not as bad as Always so it's kind of stuck in the middle: good without being great.Inspired or maybe not but a real-life story, the film centers on Viktor Navorsky from the fictional country of Krakohzia who flew in to New York. But while he was in the air, rebels overthrew the government which essentially made his passport invalid and now he's stuck in a curious dilemma: he can't enter the United States since he has no valid passport yet he can't go home since he doesn't have a ""home"" to go to. He's basically stuck in the airport and has to live there. But don't mean he can't make friends and he becomes acquainted with some of the other hired help, a gorgeous stewardess and to a lesser extent, the guy running the airport security.A film like the Terminal has a strange predicament since in lesser hands, this would've been an awfully boring movie yet in the hands of Spielberg and Tom Hanks, it becomes a slow good movie. This isn't really a film that's bound to get you all energized a la War of the Worlds and it doesn't have a Munich-esque message and it's there simply to have a good time. But even though it's really only 2 hours, the film feels longer than that as Viktor just lives and lives at the airport with one group supporting him and one man (sylishly played by Stanley Tucci) are not. It's a good movie to watch with your spouse but on its own, the film doesn't really do much.That doesn't mean there isn't anything to like and Hanks gives a good performance as Viktor. Appears slow yet can actually offer surprising insight, it's the kind of role where in someone else's hands, he would just be cartoony. The only weak link is Catherine Zeta-Jones. It's not for aesthetic reasons since let's face it, she's really easy on the eyes; but she's kind of thinly written and her fascination with Napoleon and her bookishness comes across as just...strange. Speaking of aesthetic, the film has a great set with the airport built from scratch using a hanger and it's quite something to see. Sure it looks like any old airport but the fact they actually made one complete with working escalators and working restaurants makes it more special for some reason.Sure this film isn't that great and of his recent output from A.I to Munich it's probably the worst, yet there's something watchable about the whole thing and that's quite something.",3,3.5; not really great but not terrible either,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,2876,"['directors', 'such', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'take', 'new', 'stories', 'themes', 'time', 'out', 'something', 'new', 'could', 'be', 'frustrating', 'times', 'want', 'serious', 'masterpiece', 'Schindler', 'List', 'just', 'want', 'rollicking', 'good', 'time', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'interesting', 'Terminal', 'more', 'Always/E.T', 'mode', 'here', 'going', 'sentimentality', 'drama', 'thrills', 'gravitas', 'film', 'E.T', 'then', 'again', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Always', 'kind', 'stuck', 'middle', 'good', 'being', 'great.Inspired', 'maybe', 'not', 'real-life', 'story', 'film', 'centers', 'Viktor', 'Navorsky', 'fictional', 'country', 'Krakohzia', 'who', 'flew', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'air', 'rebels', 'overthrew', 'government', 'essentially', 'made', 'passport', 'invalid', 'now', 'stuck', 'curious', 'dilemma', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enter', 'United', 'States', 'valid', 'passport', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'home', ""n't"", 'have', 'home', 'go', 'basically', 'stuck', 'airport', 'live', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'friends', 'acquainted', 'other', 'hired', 'help', 'gorgeous', 'stewardess', 'lesser', 'extent', 'guy', 'running', 'airport', 'security.A', 'film', 'Terminal', 'strange', 'predicament', 'lesser', 'hands', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'awfully', 'boring', 'movie', 'yet', 'hands', 'Spielberg', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'slow', 'good', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'film', 'bound', 'get', 'energized', 'la', 'War', 'Worlds', ""n't"", 'have', 'Munich-esque', 'message', 'there', 'simply', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'even', 'really', 'only', '2', 'hours', 'film', 'feels', 'longer', 'Viktor', 'just', 'airport', 'one', 'group', 'supporting', 'one', 'man', 'sylishly', 'played', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'spouse', 'own', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much.That', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'anything', 'like', 'Hanks', 'good', 'performance', 'Viktor', 'Appears', 'slow', 'yet', 'can', 'actually', 'offer', 'surprising', 'insight', 'kind', 'role', 'where', 'someone', 'else', 'hands', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'cartoony', 'only', 'weak', 'link', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'not', 'aesthetic', 'reasons', 'let', 'face', 'really', 'easy', 'eyes', 'kind', 'thinly', 'written', 'fascination', 'Napoleon', 'bookishness', 'just', 'strange', 'Speaking', 'aesthetic', 'film', 'great', 'set', 'airport', 'built', 'scratch', 'using', 'hanger', 'quite', 'something', 'see', 'Sure', 'old', 'airport', 'fact', 'actually', 'made', 'one', 'complete', 'working', 'escalators', 'working', 'restaurants', 'more', 'special', 'reason.Sure', 'film', ""n't"", 'great', 'recent', 'output', 'A.I', 'Munich', 'probably', 'worst', 'yet', 'something', 'watchable', 'whole', 'thing', 'quite', 'something']",N/A

623798,A3VDGERHHLOQVQ,B00005JMYC,Crabby Apple Mick Lee,"[0, 0]","This is a great little film.  Tom Hanks acts his butt off as a man caught in the ""no man's land"" of international politics and the cracks of bureaucratic machinations.  Trapped in the JFK airport terminal, Hanks plays a traveler from a fictitious Eastern European country.whose passport is suddenly worthless because of war.  As Viktor Navorski, Hanks knows no English and no one in the United States.  Most of the film details how Viktor survives for months in the terminal and the relationships he develops with the various denizens of airport life and commerce.Viktor quickly meets his nemesis in the head of Immigration Services (Stanley Tucci) who tries to dispense with Viktor by sending him into traps that would get him arrested by other governmental services.  Cruel but it would get Viktor out of his hair.But in the midst of all these situations, Viktor also meets a woman who is deeply entrapped as well.  Amelia Warren (Katherine Zeta Jones) is a flight attendant who literally has a man in every port.  The man she is deeply attached to in New York is a married man.  She hopes against hope that this would be the man to break her from her dreary life-but he would have to leave wife and children.  Somewhere in her heart, Amelia knows that she is just being strung along: but she can't stop.  Viktor and Amelia meet and over several months and the possibility of an unlikely but positive romance develops.It is not until near the end of the film that we find out why Viktor was in America to begin with.  His mission is truly heartbreaking and sentimental.  The casual moviegoer may not know the true significance of the photograph Viktor produces at one point.  The picture is ""Jazz On A Summer Afternoon"" and it is one of the true icons of emotional and historical significance in the jazz world.  Entire books and magazine articles have been written about this photograph.  That Viktor brings this photograph from a forlorn part of the world to New York is the key to the heart of this wonderful movie.Some may find the ending unsatisfying and I admit I was caught up short myself.  But even still, the ending is a happy one.

623799,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00005JMYC,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 1]","The Terminal continues what is becoming known as the Hanks-Spielburg collaboration, this being the third film directed by Spielburg with Hanks as the star (or co-star).  Of course, Spielburg's usual crew of cinematographer Kaminski, composer John Williams, and editor Michael Kahn are also present, and this film certainly has the same feel-good atmosphere of ""Catch Me If You Can.""  Surely, you are jaded and cynical beyond reason if you don't come away from this film with a smile on your face!A film like this depends critically on the performance of its star, Tom Hanks.  He appears in most of the scenes; at 127 minutes, he's probably in 115 of them.  We needn't worry - Hanks is probably the greatest current American actor and pulls off the material effortlessly, including a Russian-esque accent that never slips. (except when he hails a cab - his ""TAXI!"" exclamation sounds like he's lived in New York for 20 years!)  The supporting characters are generally good - Catherine Zeta Jones is luminous without being overpowering, and I especially liked Zoe Zaldana as the patient customs officer.  Janusz Kaminski (and the set designers) use light tones and bright lights but he never lets the colour wash out (like in Minority Report or Saving Private Ryan) - the colours are sterile yet cheerful.  The cinematography is perfectly complimented by Williams's clarinet-laden score, which is reminiscent of his Harry Potter music.Unfortunately, others of the supporting cast are either stereotyped or cartoonish.  Hanks's foil, the airport commissioner, seems to change personality to suit the whims of the plot - at times he is understanding and compassionate, at times he is a raging, tooth-gnashing bully.  Perhaps he's supposed to be bipolar?  Anyways, his scenes never ring true.  Similarly, Hanks's trio of friends (one Indian custodian, one black baggage handler, and one Hispanic technician) are seemingly added for ethnic colour.  These are not fatal flaws, however.As for this DVD edition, it is unfortunately dreadfully poor.  There are literally no extras - not even the theatrical trailer is included.  I am getting used to Spielburg's DVD's being not with the money, but this is a new low even for him.  I know he's a busy man, but surely if Peter Jackson and George Lucas can take the time to put together such impressive packages for the LotR and Star Wars DVD's, the folks at Dreamworks could at least come up with a theatrical trailer!",3,A decent movie on yet another featureless Spielburg DVD,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,2456,"['Terminal', 'what', 'becoming', 'known', 'Hanks-Spielburg', 'collaboration', 'being', 'third', 'film', 'directed', 'Spielburg', 'Hanks', 'star', 'co-star', 'course', 'Spielburg', 'usual', 'crew', 'cinematographer', 'Kaminski', 'composer', 'John', 'Williams', 'editor', 'Michael', 'Kahn', 'are', 'also', 'present', 'film', 'certainly', 'same', 'feel-good', 'atmosphere', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'Surely', 'are', 'jaded', 'cynical', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'away', 'film', 'smile', 'face', 'film', 'critically', 'performance', 'star', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'most', 'scenes', '127', 'minutes', 'probably', '115', 'need', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Hanks', 'probably', 'greatest', 'current', 'American', 'actor', 'off', 'material', 'effortlessly', 'including', 'Russian-esque', 'accent', 'never', 'when', 'cab', 'TAXI', 'exclamation', 'lived', 'New', 'York', '20', 'years', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'good', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'luminous', 'being', 'overpowering', 'especially', 'liked', 'Zoe', 'Zaldana', 'patient', 'customs', 'officer', 'Janusz', 'Kaminski', 'set', 'designers', 'use', 'light', 'tones', 'bright', 'lights', 'never', 'colour', 'wash', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'colours', 'are', 'sterile', 'yet', 'cheerful', 'cinematography', 'perfectly', 'complimented', 'Williams', 'clarinet-laden', 'score', 'reminiscent', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'music.Unfortunately', 'others', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'stereotyped', 'cartoonish', 'Hanks', 'foil', 'airport', 'commissioner', 'change', 'personality', 'suit', 'whims', 'plot', 'times', 'understanding', 'compassionate', 'times', 'raging', 'tooth-gnashing', 'bully', 'Perhaps', 'supposed', 'be', 'bipolar', 'Anyways', 'scenes', 'never', 'ring', 'true', 'Similarly', 'Hanks', 'trio', 'friends', 'one', 'Indian', 'custodian', 'one', 'black', 'baggage', 'handler', 'one', 'Hispanic', 'technician', 'are', 'seemingly', 'added', 'ethnic', 'colour', 'are', 'not', 'fatal', 'flaws', 'however.As', 'DVD', 'edition', 'unfortunately', 'dreadfully', 'poor', 'are', 'literally', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'included', 'am', 'getting', 'used', 'Spielburg', 'DVD', 'being', 'not', 'money', 'new', 'low', 'even', 'know', 'busy', 'man', 'surely', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'George', 'Lucas', 'can', 'take', 'time', 'put', 'together', 'such', 'impressive', 'packages', 'LotR', 'Star', 'Wars', 'DVD', 'folks', 'Dreamworks', 'could', 'least', 'come', 'up', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

It is sort of like Kafka written in whipped cream.  Tom Hanks plays Victor Navorski with intelligence and his usual warmth.  Hanks has to manage a vague Eastern European accent as his character learns some English over his months in the terminal and he pulls that bit of craft off pretty well.Stanley Tucci plays what passes for a bad guy in this film.  He is a minor customs official who uses the rules to enhance his own sense of standing and power.  He is the worst kind of bureaucrat.  If you wanted to be sympathetic, you could plead on his behalf that he is trying to keep order amidst chaos, however, his retiring boss appears to have done a better job with a kinder heart under the same circumstances.The story is completely artificial.  I mean, one would think a news crew would get wind of a man living in an airport terminal for months on end.  Wouldn't the State Department look for Krakozian nationals affected by the war in their homeland?  But reality is not the point of this film.  Its point is to make a point about the life embracing Victor and his victory (get it) over petty and life robbing bureaucracy.There are a few especially fine moments in the movie, but somehow it never really pays off.

While existing in this bureaucratic limbo, he endears himself to nearly everyone he meets with his simple, open, honest nature.In this contrived film, Steven Spielberg indulges his worst instincts for the sappy and sentimental.  Many viewers may be willing to suspend their disbelief in order to enjoy this modern fable, but I felt that I was being asked to accept too much for too little return.  Victor arrives speaking very little English, but before long he is able to comprehend everything said to him while speaking very good, albeit broken, English himself.  How does he acomplish this?  By comparing an English guide book to a copy translated into his own language.  As a teacher with a Master's degree in ESL (English as a Second Language), trust me--it ain't that easy.  We are also asked to believe that the workers of a massive modern airport are all members of a happy little community who have long after-hours poker games and are willing to rush away from their jobs in order to witness some big development in Victor's dilemma rather than workers in independant shops and departments who have lives in the outside world.

623807,A27ZOCD5B63Y0P,B00005JMYC,"D. Collier ""Shelf-Help""","[12, 17]","Like virtually all other moviegoers, I was very excited about a new movie starring Tom Hanks and directed by Steven Spielberg.  I never would have guessed that something would go seriously awry with this film.  I certainly never would have guessed what that something would be either.Well, let me go over the good things first.  The storyline is fascinating.  The idea of a foreigner indefinitely trapped in an airport terminal because of a violent military coup in his own country and the current U.S. immigration laws here -- a story with such a premise is guarranteed to contain a good deal of drama and comedy.  The acting was superb.  Yes, it's true that Tom Hanks's accent was awkward and felt out of place at first, but after awhile it starts to grow on you if you're patient.  And Stanley Tucci (A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, ROAD TO PERDITION) is one of the very best supporting actors in movies today.  All of the character development is top-notch.So with all these great things to say, what could possibly be wrong with this movie?  Well, for one there was the incredibly cheesy (and almost unnecessary) subplot involving Catherine Zeta-Jones's interaction with Tom Hanks.  As a mere character in the film, she was fine.  But when they started to talk to each other, it made me wish the screenplay writer had been fired early on.  (My complaint revolves mainly around the ""I'm like Napoleon"" conversation.  It was very lame, and very contrived.)  Another complaint I have was John Williams's score.  It could have been so much better if he had just picked it up a little.  Criticizing the greatest composer of the last 100 years is not something I do lightly.  Unlike most other filmscore composers, after you watch a film whose music was composed by John Williams, you'll usually be humming the main theme for the rest of the day.  But I don't even remember what the main theme was for THE TERMINAL.However, none of those gripes constitute my primary problem with THE TERMINAL.  My biggest problem with this movie is that it wasn't great.  It was simply okay, or adequate.  Do all movies have to be great?  Only if they're made by great filmmakers.  Steven Spielberg is easily the greatest filmmaker of the last 25 years.  Therefore, I don't think I'm being unreasonable when I hold his films to a higher standard (the standard which he himself has set) than the rest.  I expect greatness from Spielberg. This wasn't great.  It was just okay.Therefore, 2.5 stars (but I'll round up to 3).",3,It's okay...but it's not great,1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,2498,"['virtually', 'other', 'moviegoers', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'new', 'movie', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'something', 'would', 'go', 'seriously', 'awry', 'film', 'certainly', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'what', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'either.Well', 'let', 'go', 'good', 'things', 'first', 'storyline', 'fascinating', 'idea', 'foreigner', 'indefinitely', 'trapped', 'airport', 'terminal', 'violent', 'military', 'coup', 'own', 'country', 'current', 'U.S.', 'immigration', 'laws', 'here', 'story', 'premise', 'guarranteed', 'contain', 'good', 'deal', 'drama', 'comedy', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'Yes', 'true', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'accent', 'was', 'awkward', 'felt', 'place', 'first', 'grow', ""'re"", 'patient', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'A', 'MIDSUMMER', 'NIGHT', 'DREAM', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'PERDITION', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'supporting', 'actors', 'movies', 'today', 'character', 'development', 'top-notch.So', 'great', 'things', 'say', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'wrong', 'movie', 'Well', 'one', 'was', 'incredibly', 'cheesy', 'almost', 'unnecessary', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'interaction', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'mere', 'character', 'film', 'was', 'fine', 'when', 'started', 'talk', 'other', 'made', 'wish', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'had', 'been', 'fired', 'early', 'complaint', 'mainly', ""'m"", 'Napoleon', 'conversation', 'was', 'very', 'lame', 'very', 'contrived', 'complaint', 'have', 'was', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'just', 'picked', 'up', 'little', 'Criticizing', 'greatest', 'composer', 'last', '100', 'years', 'not', 'something', 'do', 'lightly', 'most', 'other', 'filmscore', 'composers', 'watch', 'film', 'music', 'was', 'composed', 'John', 'Williams', ""'ll"", 'usually', 'be', 'humming', 'main', 'theme', 'rest', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'what', 'main', 'theme', 'was', 'THE', 'TERMINAL.However', 'none', 'gripes', 'constitute', 'primary', 'problem', 'TERMINAL', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', 'simply', 'okay', 'adequate', 'Do', 'movies', 'have', 'be', 'great', 'Only', ""'re"", 'made', 'great', 'filmmakers', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'easily', 'greatest', 'filmmaker', 'last', '25', 'years', 'Therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'being', 'unreasonable', 'when', 'hold', 'films', 'higher', 'standard', 'standard', 'set', 'rest', 'expect', 'greatness', 'Spielberg', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', 'just', 'okay.Therefore', '2.5', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'round', 'up', '3']",N/A

The reason? This movie hardly deserves the two stars I gave it. Tom Hanks' acting was of course brilliant, no one could dispute that but the script... Oh, the script was just horrendous. The movie could not have possibly moved any slower than it did. I kept looking over at the counter on my DVD player hoping that it was almost over but it just seemed to go on and on forever.I probably would not have been so bothered by this film if there had not been a love interest. Why must film-makers always make a complicated and boring situation even worse by introducing an actress that can barely manage to recite the script and act the part of her character at the same time? I was extremely disturbed by the lack of logic behind introducing Catherine's character and to make matters worse it took absolutely forever for them to finally get together. Again, the slow-moving script made me glance so many times at the counter that I missed ""important"" parts of the movie.Possibly the only good things about this movie that saved it from one star status is the fact that Tom's character was an intriguing guy and I enjoyed the scenes where he helped the people he was forced to spend time with. However, the ending was a major letdown and I was rather upset that I had wasted so much time watching this movie instead of reading a good book.I suggest that you do not watch this movie.

The movie was inspired by the story of Merhan Nasseri, an Iranian refugee.Viktor basically starts living at JFK, in Gate 67 carrying around a peanut can filled with secrets, that everyone seems curious about. After he accidentally lost his food vouchers, he finds creative ways of making money to eat. When that fails, his friend Enrique bribes him with food, while having him do favors for him---giving love notes and etc to Officer Torres, a woman who works at the airport.Viktor quickly makes friends with the staff and also keeps seeing the same flight attendant Amelia, played by Catherine Zeta Jones. In my opinion, her character was not needed. I know that Hollywood movies seem to put a &quot;romantic interest&quot; in the movie to liven it up, but this movie didn't need that. The premise was interesting on it's own.Stanley Tucci plays a great villian. Someone who tries to get rid of Viktor, and have someone else &quot;deal with him.&quot; Viktor, of course, is too smart for him. Especially since he learned English so quickly. (I'm not sure how realistic that was.)As the ending nears, some other scenes were questionable, the type that would have warmed my heart when I was thirteen years old, but makes me squirm in my seat today. The cheesiness factor was high.But, I believe that the best part of this film was Tom Hanks. He was good as a frustrating non English-speaking foreigner who answered &quot;yes&quot; to every question asked. He was also lovable. You did want to root for him.Unfortunately, I straddle the fence on this one.

If you were to compare this to, say, SCHINDLER'S LIST or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, I could see how the dramatic intensity, as well as the thematic elements, pale in comparison here.  However, that doesn't mean that THE TERMINAL isn't good entertainment.  This is what I would call a good popcorn flick.  What's more, it makes you think.Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) arrives in JFK National Airport, speaking no English and unable to leave the premises, due to the fact that his (fictional) Eastern European nation is currently in the middle of a great civil war, and, as a result of the events there, he is a man without a country, and therefore, his passport (issued there) is invalid and he belongs nowhere.  [Quite a metaphor for many of us, during this politically uncertain time.]  Therefore, he sets up residence in the airport, sleeps on the pull-out chairs in the lobby, makes friends and even manages to make a living!  Along the way, he touches the lives of nearly everyone who comes across his path, and even manages to learn English.  All the while, our villain, an airline employee (Stanley Tucci) is determined to have Navorski removed from the airport, so, as to earn his promotion and banish this immigrant who stands in the way of his career advancement.This film was released after 9/11, and also at the height of the surge in advanced airport and Homeland security.  I think that the premise of this film is a very intriguing one indeed, and really makes us question how our values and beliefs in the United States have evolved, since we have been conditioned to be afraid of anyone who is foreign or diverges from the belief that we must stamp out all outsiders who  might pose a considerable (or imagined) threat.

There are also some very charming moments between his and the other characters.There are two main issues I have with Terminal. On occasion, Spielberg falls prey to his penchant for over-sentimentalization. For instance, do we really need four reaction shots of people fawning over a good deed Hanks' character does for a secondary character? In another part, dozens of characters rally around the protagonist in another sentimental scene, but the direction is so heavy-handed I literally groaned. I actually love sentiment, but a little subtlety goes a long way.I also had problems with how certain plot and character threads played out. I won't give anything away, but let me just say, this movie is set up as a low key comedy, with a sweet romantic subplot; and sometimes it's okay for movies to just give into convention and go with their own flow. Instead, Terminal goes for a more philosophical conclusion that I found disappointing. It brings us in one direction with the romance plot and then whiplashes us into another.Relatedly, I was disappointed with how little character development there is with regard to the three main characters - Hanks', Zeta-Jones's, and Tucci's. All three are pretty much the same at the end of the movie as in the beginning. The movie winds up giving way to themes related to fate and destiny that I just didn't like in relation to the rest of the film.Having spent all this time criticizing it, I would still say it's a solid three star movie. Ultimately, on some level I can appreciate its attempt to defy expectations, and it never stopped being entertaining. If you're a Hanks fan, and if you go into it setting aside your expectations as to how a romantic comedy normally plays out, you'll probably find it enjoyable.",3,"Defies expectations, but not always in a good way",1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,1800,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'usual', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'charming', 'moments', 'other', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'issues', 'have', 'Terminal', 'occasion', 'Spielberg', 'prey', 'penchant', 'over-sentimentalization', 'instance', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'four', 'reaction', 'shots', 'people', 'fawning', 'good', 'deed', 'Hanks', 'character', 'secondary', 'character', 'part', 'dozens', 'characters', 'rally', 'protagonist', 'sentimental', 'scene', 'direction', 'so', 'heavy-handed', 'literally', 'groaned', 'actually', 'love', 'sentiment', 'little', 'subtlety', 'long', 'way.I', 'also', 'had', 'problems', 'how', 'certain', 'plot', 'character', 'threads', 'played', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'low', 'key', 'comedy', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'okay', 'movies', 'just', 'give', 'convention', 'go', 'own', 'flow', 'Instead', 'Terminal', 'more', 'philosophical', 'conclusion', 'found', 'disappointing', 'one', 'direction', 'romance', 'plot', 'then', 'whiplashes', 'another.Relatedly', 'was', 'disappointed', 'how', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'regard', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Hanks', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Tucci', 'three', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'end', 'movie', 'beginning', 'movie', 'up', 'giving', 'way', 'themes', 'related', 'fate', 'destiny', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'relation', 'rest', 'film.Having', 'spent', 'time', 'criticizing', 'would', 'still', 'say', 'solid', 'three', 'star', 'movie', 'Ultimately', 'level', 'can', 'appreciate', 'attempt', 'defy', 'expectations', 'never', 'stopped', 'being', 'entertaining', ""'re"", 'Hanks', 'fan', 'go', 'setting', 'aside', 'expectations', 'how', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'normally', 'out', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'enjoyable']",N/A

For the Yiddish-impaired, what is ""schlock,"" you ask?  It's a combination of that four letter word that begins with ""sh"" and just shamelessly transparent, relentlessly pandering, manipulative sentimentalism as purple and putrid as the worst of the old 1970s Walt Disney TV shows---you know, the ones with the cute fluffy dog and his cute little boy owner helping each other through a world of kindly yet misguided adults.That's what ""The Terminal"" pretty much is, with Tom Hanks playing the overgrown cute little boy, and his character's lack of English language skills as the cute fluffy dog.  The whole film could be summed up as ""good natured but non-English-speaking good guy gets stuck living in a NYC airport terminal but of course somehow manages to make lemonade out of all the lemons dumped on his lap.""This one was particularly annoying because it basically has one gag which gets repeated about once every ten seconds: Tom Hanks' character doesn't understand or speak a lick of English, and finds himself surrounded by people who don't understand or speak a word of HIS native language.

Steven Spielberg is a director without a destination caught trying to stretch a curious premise, borrowed from real life, into a fable about the immigrant dream. In ""The Terminal"", he knits together patches of comedy, pathos, political commentary, and romance to create an interminable and finally inconsequential movie. There's no thematic focal point in the screenplay (Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson) and so Spielberg takes refuge in his favorite subject: the bond between father and son.Spielberg starts things off well enough, with a first act that effectively captures how disorienting a situation this would be for a man struggling with a language barrier and unable to comprehend what is transpiring.  However, the intriguing premise (based on an Iranian refugee's experience at France's Charles de Gaulle Airport) soon becomes a labored and contrived layover for the viewer.The film begins to introduce one ridiculous supporting character after another -- a crazy Indian janitor (Kumar Pallana), a beautiful flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones), and a lovestruck food-service employee (Diego Luna) until it feels like a marathon viewing of the first few episodes of a sitcom or, even worse, a soap opera. This is a world where secondary characters exist only to bolster the protagonist; they apparently have no lives beyond their day job. Their absurd actions eventually require greater and greater suspensions of disbelief as the film progresses.""The Terminal"" is not a bad film; it just doesn't really have much of a point, direction, or a reason for being made.  It certainly has its moments; genuine moments that will have you dissolving into laughter or maybe even shedding a tear or two.

But on the other hand, you might find this film a very enjoyable experience. It's a good-hearted comedy/drama with impressive performances from Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Diego Luna, Stanley Tucci, etc. Tom Hanks is especially good here. He captures the oblivious-turned innocent attitude almost perfectly, and he gets into character very well. Tucci is a standard cardboard cutout bad guy for most of the film, but he's not too distracting. The comedy is mostly light-hearted (no vulgar jokes or toilet humor), which I guess is appropriate for this sort of film. In the end, it's obvious that this isn't one of Spielberg's best films.

Unknown to him, while his passport and documents are being checked ... there is revolution in his country. The President and other officials were murdered, the new government is *not* recognized by the USA and ... poor Viktor is denied access to his big dream ... to visit New York City. He meets with the Director of the airport security, who patiently explains to him - he is without a country, an unacceptable visitor. To compound matters, Viktor can not return to Krakozhia under the current conditions, there are no flights to the unrecognized country. In essence, he is stuck at the airport ... Thus begins one of the most creative comedies based on parodies of what could potentially be real events in today's world.Viktor makes the best of a bad situation. He receives food vouchers but ends up losing them. He eats fast food until his money runs out then he makes mini-sandwiches out of free crackers and ketchup or mustard. Eventually, he befriends some of the airport personnell. An eternal optimist, Viktor continues to complete documents to petition entering New York, his persistence and good nature do not go unnoticed. The Director of Security at the airport gets so tired of Viktor's presence, he gives him information about how to escape the Terminal ... in hopes that Viktor would become someone else's 'legal' problem. The Director wants to be rid of this political and legal nightmare, a visitor without documentation and legal status, stuck in the airport.Viktor becomes a fixture and empathy builds for him by the security guards, maintenance and cafeteria workers and store clerks who work at the airport. He develops a love interest with a stewardess played by Catherine Zeta Jones. He wins over a maintenace worker, who gets his kicks out of mopping floors, placing ""caution"" signs up and then watching people slip and slide as most do not read the signs. The story line is clear, the plot development is creative and engaging. The viewer connects with Viktor on all levels, rooting for him to achieve his goal ... which is gradually revealed. One of the funniest moments in the film is when a Russian young man tries to take prescription drugs onto the airplane going to Canada which is deemed an illegal act by the Security allegedly to take to his grandfather who is sick. The Director is so frustrated with the emotional antics of the Russian, he seeks an interpreter to make clear why the drugs are being confiscated ... to make him understand what laws are being broken. Viktor becomes the interpreter since his language is close to Russian ... Suddenly, Viktor beams as he explains to the Director, the drugs are *not* for a human being but for a goat. He recalls the word for grandfather and goat have the same root word ... the Director is fuming angry when he realizes Viktor's knowledge of the paperwork likely provided the clue to this likely ruse ... there is no law against taking drugs on an airplane as long as it is for an animal. Problem solved ... Needless to say, the entire the film is at times funny, serious, and overwhelmingly satisfying. The viewer discovers why it is so important for Viktor to visit New York: to keep a promise or the memory of his father alive. His father, who has passed away, had cherished certain cultural values of America and Viktor needed to finish one last task his dad could not fulfill.

Comedy just isn't something he is great at, if his monstrous 1979 belly-flop ""1941"" was any indication.  When he integrates a humorous situation into a good story, however, he does far better than most.Such is the case here.  The ever-reliable Tom Hanks stars as Victor Navorski, a native of the fictional nation of Krakozhia who finds himself lost and stranded at New York's JFK Airport when his home country is embroiled in a coup.  The airport's principal homeland security chief (Stanley Tucci) can't get him a flight out, of course; and without any diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Krakozhia, Hanks can't set foot outside the airport's International Arrivals Terminal.  Thus, he sets up his ""home"" at Gate 67 and gives Tucci and the airport security forces major (comical) headaches with his thick East European accent and misunderstandings, all the while catching the eye of a rather confused flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and making backroom deals with several airport workers.The result is similar in many ways to this film's immediate predecessor in Spielberg's canon, 2002's CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.  The wit and humor stem not merely from sight gags alone (that completely failed Spielberg in ""1941""), but the sticky situations Hanks' character finds himself in, as well as Zeta-Jones' loopy flight attendant.  As usual, Spielberg gets the most out of this situation and even takes a few verbal jabs at what now constitutes ""Homeland Security"" in our post-9/11 world.In almost any other Hollywood director's hands, THE TERMINAL would have gone stale in a big hurry.  But with Hanks in the lead and Spielberg behind the camera, a sort of modern day equivalent of the frequent pairing of James Stewart with Alfred Hitchcock, the result is one of the best films of 2004.",5,Culture Shock,1088812800,"07 3, 2004",2004,1971,"['Partly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'involved', 'Middle', 'Easterner', 'stranded', 'Paris', 'THE', 'TERMINAL', 'perhaps', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'best', 'foray', 'anything', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'comedy', 'Comedy', 'just', ""n't"", 'something', 'great', 'monstrous', '1979', 'belly-flop', '1941', 'was', 'indication', 'When', 'humorous', 'situation', 'good', 'story', 'however', 'far', 'better', 'most.Such', 'case', 'here', 'ever-reliable', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Victor', 'Navorski', 'native', 'fictional', 'nation', 'Krakozhia', 'who', 'lost', 'stranded', 'New', 'York', 'JFK', 'Airport', 'when', 'home', 'country', 'embroiled', 'coup', 'airport', 'principal', 'homeland', 'security', 'chief', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'flight', 'out', 'course', 'diplomatic', 'relations', 'U.S.', 'Krakozhia', 'Hanks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'set', 'foot', 'airport', 'International', 'Arrivals', 'Terminal', 'Thus', 'up', 'home', 'Gate', '67', 'Tucci', 'airport', 'security', 'forces', 'major', 'comical', 'headaches', 'thick', 'East', 'European', 'accent', 'misunderstandings', 'while', 'catching', 'eye', 'rather', 'confused', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'making', 'backroom', 'deals', 'several', 'airport', 'workers.The', 'result', 'similar', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'immediate', 'predecessor', 'Spielberg', 'canon', '2002', 'CATCH', 'ME', 'IF', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'wit', 'humor', 'stem', 'not', 'merely', 'sight', 'gags', 'alone', 'completely', 'failed', 'Spielberg', '1941', 'sticky', 'situations', 'Hanks', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'Zeta-Jones', 'loopy', 'flight', 'attendant', 'usual', 'Spielberg', 'most', 'situation', 'even', 'few', 'verbal', 'jabs', 'what', 'now', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'post-9/11', 'world.In', 'almost', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'hands', 'THE', 'TERMINAL', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'stale', 'big', 'hurry', 'Hanks', 'lead', 'Spielberg', 'camera', 'sort', 'modern', 'day', 'equivalent', 'frequent', 'pairing', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'result', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2004']",N/A

623836,A73DFWJE0CGY6,B00005JMYC,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[0, 0]","Imagine yourself in an airport of a country where you don't speak the language. While you were in the air, getting to that country, your country experienced a coup, and upon landing you find you are a person without a country. What now?This is the premise of ""The Terminal"", a gentle little movie tailor-made to exercise Tom Hanks' considerable acting chops. Playing the role of Viktor Navorski, a simple man from Krakosia, a small country somewhere in Europe, he exhibits more style and believability than any other actor who might have worked this part. Viktor goes through the Customs line, expecting no trouble, and submits his passport. Unfortunately for him, while he was airborne, the military coup in his country rendered that passport useless. He is taken out of the line and delivered to the airport offices of Homeland Security, to which he submits without a fuss, with no understanding of where he is going or why.The airport branch of Homeland Security is run by Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci, always worth watching), a man straining at the reins to advance himself in whatever way possible. The problem of Viktor is dropped in his lap. Viktor cannot be sent home, and he cannot be allowed to leave the International terminal. To the frustration of both Viktor and Frank, Viktor must remain in the terminal until his case is resolved.Viktor is let loose in the protected international terminal with food vouchers and nothing else. He has no contacts, and still does not know why he is being detained from leaving until he chances to see an account of the coup in his country on one of the TV monitors. Understandably frantic, he tries to communicate with someone, anyone, to help him, but is summarily dismissed by everyone he encounters. He loses his food vouchers, is moved along by authorities, and spends a miserable first night in a secluded and empty waiting area, hoping the next day will bring a resolution to his troubles.The next day, however, begins an odyssey of waiting; for an end to the coup, for his release from the terminal, for a way to get by. After several meals of saltine and ketchup sandwiches cadged from the condiment trays of various fast-food places, Viktor discovers that returning baggage trolleys to their corrals will net him redemption change, and his joy at sinking his teeth into his first real food - earned from his cart-returning - is palpable.Frank, meanwhile, has been monitoring his new denizen with a jaundiced eye. He doesn't want Viktor any more than Viktor wants to be there, but cannot arrive at a solution. His attempts to lure Viktor to leave - thus making him a headache for INS instead of Frank - are stymied by Viktor figuring this plot out. He knows he'll get in trouble if he goes out, and smells a huge rat whenever Frank proposes some new way out for him.It's hard to tell how much time is supposed to elapse throughout the movie, but enough at least for Viktor to learn English from industriously watching monitors of shows in English and comparing what is said to a translation in Krakosian. He also gradually makes friends with various low-level workers throughout the terminal; a baggage handler, a maintenance man, and a clerk assigned to clear people to leave. He wins them over and becomes part of the terminal family, and makes a home for himself in an unused corner of the place. Along the way, he falls in love with a flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is having man problems, and who recognizes Viktor as a friend but nothing more.Directed by Stephen Spielberg, the film probably lasts a little longer than necessary but works longer than it would have under less capable hands. It is fascinating to watch Hanks in action; there is nothing in the way of acting that this man cannot handle, and he does such an admirable job of it here that if there was more weight to the movie he might have gleaned an award. His panic at being marooned in this huge place, amongst a sea of people uninterested in his plight, and his manner of turning things to his advantage, are all presented with such ingenuity and style that it is impossible not to cheer with every victory. Stanley Tucci, as Frank, is also memorable as the Simon Lagree figure, eager to bring Viktor low to be rid of him. All of the side characters that fill out Viktor's world make for interesting watching also, as their individual stories begin to come out.This was a worthy 2 hours, not boring anywhere, and one of Tom Hanks' best works, in my opinion. It came and went without a lot of fanfare, but is good enough to have in a collection for a rainy night, when it's nice to reflect on the joys of a safe haven, a warm bed, and plenty to eat, in a place where people know you. I know I think of things differently now, when I fly out of the country. What would I do in the same circumstance?Rated four stars by me only because it wasn't a particularly major film.

What happens when an innocent man gets trapped by rules and regulations? He becomes the puppet of bureaucracy and corporate endeavors. He becomes the fish in the 'fishbowl', whose life is an open book to all those working and moving around his makeshift 'home'.But, wait! His talents surface and rescue him from his doomed fate of 'death' in an airport for that's what death is when one isn't allowed to 'live'. Goals often get postponed as did Viktor's but in the end we learn from our new experiences and the mission is accomplished, even with the addition of a few great new friends who would not have surfaced if not for the imposing situation.Such was the mission of Viktor.

623844,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JMYC,Grady Harp,"[35, 38]","THE TERMINAL is a difficult movie to score - it is a highly entertaining film, very well crafted, with a dazzling set of actors in the leads and comprimario roles, and has a nice take on the microcosm of the airport as the confines of the universe - and for all the feel-good Steven Spielbergisms it engenders, there is still something that makes it not quite score a full five.  The set is fantastic and very well used.  The line between comedy and absurdity and tragedy is pretty well delineated, but there are a few too many bleeps in the continuity of the tale (and the characters) to overlook.Tom Hanks proves again that he can create a memorable character as Viktor, a simple man with a mission who finds himself entrapped in JKF airport by an accidental loss of his country to villainous overthrow (beginning to catch the overtones Spielberg drives home?) and is kept 'prisoner' by the upwardly mobile Customs agent Frank Dixon ( played well by Stanley Tucci).  At first Viktor speaks no English (tremendously comic scenes of how one reacts to a language that is completely foreign) and so must survive his prolonged stay in the airport by eating free crackers-and-mustard/catsup sandwiches, sleeping in the reconstruction site of the airport, 'bathing' in the restrooms (get it?).  Slowly he encounters airport workers who come to his aid by mutual coercion (Gupta - the hilarious Indian custodian played exceptionally well by Kumar Pallana, Enrique who transports food and is lovable in the capable hands of Diego Luna, even the security clerk Torres played by Zoe Saldana and Mulroy played by Chi McBride), survives, suddenly able to speak a LOT of English (though with a delightfully consistent Slavic accent) he falls for a stewardess (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who has spent her life waiting for the right man to come along.  The ending looks like it is going to be right out THE MUSIC MAN until the film takes a syrupy turn and ends not with a bang but with a whimper.  There is nothing not to like about this warm movie, it is just a little too Hollywood.  But all is forgiven if you can just watch it for 1) the performances and 2) for the simple quiet message that we all are dependent on each other in this far too busy, suspicious,  and alien world.

Hanks is absolutely amazing in his role. I forgot it was him for the majority of the film, and though that should be par for the acting course, it's not for many actors. He loses himself as Victor, and he's not afraid to lay it out for his character. He changed his walk, stance, everything for Victor. It's the complete package, and Hanks never misses a beat.Spielberg delivers what you expect: excellent directing. There are so many little touches in the background during the entire film that you sit and smile when you catch it, and when a scene comes off as completely coherent, you realize there was so much reinforcing what had occurred. The typical (of recent films anyway) Spielberg lighting comes into play frequently, and it makes for a lovely film. He got such a marvelous performance from Hanks and the rest of the cast...must be a really famous director, eh?Catherine Zeta-Jones had a smaller role than I expected, but she still pulled a decent performance. I believed her, for the most part. A couple scenes, no, but for the most part.The supporting cast of Victor's airport friends is marvelous. The chemistry between them and Hanks is great, even with Hanks not speaking English very well. I really like those characters, and the actors pulled it off brilliantly.The script is good, dialogue believable, and story followable and lovable.My only complaint with the film is that it seemed a little drawn out at points. It's about 2 hours, and I thought it could've been shorter. But the subplots keep you entertained, and you really grow to appreciate the characters. There are some fascinating character developments and studies in this one.

623851,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B00005JMYC,Ian,"[2, 3]","...when movies were made to tell a story, when they were not being made sorley for the purpose of making money.  The Terminal is a diamond in the rough, a treasure thats overlooked by many, but those who seek it and watch it will be well rewarded.In many ways, the Termial is a throwback to a movie making era long past.  As far as I can tell, there are no real special effects in the movie (OK, maybe some bluescreen and some shooting coins, but thats it).  There are no explosions, no violent deaths, no gunfights.  All there is are people talking, carachter development and just a touch of humor.The plot concerns a man named Viktor, who's country has been temporarily overthrown, meaning that he has no country.  So he cant go back, and he cant go forward into the United States.  So now he's stuck at an airport.  He has to survive withought any money or food, all the while being slowly manipulated by the airports new director, who is not happy about him staying there...The plot may be simple, but the performances are what makes this movie shine.  Tom Hanks is brilliant as Viktor.  You really do care about his charachter, whos just a simple traveler who wants to go to New York city, yet he cant understand why he has to stay at the airport.  As time goes on, Viktor learns more and more english, and we get to understand him better.  Hank's performance simply must be seen to believe.  The supporting cast is top notch as well.  Everyone, from the food delivery guy, to the head of security has a top notch performance.I had a lot of fun watching how a man adapts to living in an airport, from eating crackers to getting a place to sleep, and finding out more about the people who work at the airport.  You know those people who stay behind desks and stamp papers endlessly?  After watching this movie, i'll never look at them the same way again.One performance that really stands out for me is that of the janitor.  At first he's a grumpy old man, but as you get to know him better, he has a sad past.  And his last scene in the movie is incredible, but I will say nothing of that.In this age where we routinely see decapitations, limbs getting sliced off, and people getting blown up in a movie, this film has a moment near the end that litteraly stopped my heart for a moment because I was so shocked and frightened when I saw it.  We see a guy get blown up, we yawn.  You watch this scene, and you'll be terrified for the charachter in the scene.  My family and I were in shock while watching it.  Its a heartbreaking moment.Aside from a great cast, the Terminal really explores the idea of people who are not related in any way, getting to know each other and who they are.  And it does it incredibly well.Sadly, the last five minutes of the film are a small let down, as if Steven Spielberg can't decide when to end the movie.

In spite of these ""flaws"" this movie still managed to make me laugh...and I really did like it.Tom Hanks is Victor Navorski, who just flew in from his (fictional) European country, ready to hit the streets of New York.  The problem is, his country has gone to war, and all passports have been suspended from that country until further notice.  This leaves Victor without a country, so to speak, because he can't legally go onto American Soil.So Victor camps out for over a year in the Foreign Terminal, literally living out of his suitcase and sleeping in Gate 67.  (I think).  He interacts with the people that work for the airport, and even falls in love with a flight attendant.  All while he ""waits"" as the airport officials told him to do.Tom Hanks pulls of an excellent performance, as he usually does no matter what out of the way script is handed to him, or what over the top plot he has to work in (or around).  He does it wonderfully, with a FINE accent to boot.  (He gets SO annoying at times, which leads me to believe he did his job well!)The climax and the end were a little disappointing to me, and since I really am not familiar with the particulars of immigration and Airport practices, I could only take the movie for what it was worth.

That's not to say that he made a bad film; there's some to be said for Catch Me If You Can, Minority Report, Amistad and, to a certain extent, AI as well; but none of these show any sign of the brilliant and original spark of the genius who created Close Encounters, Jaws, ET, Indiana Jones, The Color Purple, Empire of the Sun, or Duel. On the contrary - Spielberg seems to have created a monster he cannot control, and each film he makes seems, at least a bit, like a cruel parody on him, as he employs every Hollywood clich&eacute; that he himself invented all those years ago.The Terminal is no exception. Spielberg's third collaboration with Tom Hanks - who(apologies to the hordes of Hanks fans out there), be he an astronaut, a boy in an adult body, a detective, a con artist or a refugee from a war-torn country, will always be Tom Hanks - which, like the other two, is based on a true story, is by far the weakest of the bunch. The film starts out with a great and fascinating premise, as a biting satire about the cruelty of capitalist beaurocracy, and as long as that is the subject, it's both funny and touching, as it shows the way the Uncle Sam treads all over the little man. Spielberg, however, doesn't manage to fill more than thirty minutes with that concept, and soon enough we find him swimming towards the safe and known shores of physical humor and romantic comedy. The story about the man forced to live in an airport is of course a terrible stretch, but it gets across and manages to convince; once Catherine Zeta Jones steps in is when the story becomes unbelievable. The film soon turns into a cheesy, unconvincing romance with some really bad dialogue, and loses all its uniqueness and originality.Obviously, The Terminal has its moments; it's Spielberg, after all, and is entertaining at the very least. I expected more, though. In all likelihood this is Spielberg's worst movie, or at least the worst in some years.

When a lawful government in a foreign country is ousted by an unlawful revolution and replaced by a fully illegal government that the US does not recognize, all flights from  and to this foreign countries are banned in the US, and all citizens from this country have unvalid passports. If this happens to take place when one of these citizens is in the terminal of the airport before going through customs he can never get an entry-visa and is trapped in the airport for a long time. Imagine this situation and imagine the passenger is an enterprising but law abiding man and you can imagine too how he is going to find a place in the terminal, in the hearts of all the regular workers in that terminal including security officers, and even in some transient personnel like stewardesses or who knows what and whom. There we find out that this silly situation can become pathetic and even full of empathy and sympathy, even some compassion. One could live for a long long time in a terminal. But everything has to come to an end one day and it is even more difficult to bring the absurd situation to an end than to avoid it or solve it. At times it is funny. At times it is a deep satire of American security obsession. At times it is symbolical and metaphorical. But it is  always extremely human and even humane.

The visa that would have allowed him into the USA was revoked due to a military coup that happened in his country while he was in flight.  The man simply does not understand.  Without an interpreter and they are speaking English to him that he knows very little of, they try to help the man realize he can not go into New York City and can not go back to Krakozhia.  His country is under new leadership, the borders are sealed.  For now, he must stay within the Airport.  He can not take another flight out, he can not step outside.  They make him stay in the International Transit Lounge where he may shop.  He is given freely food vouchers, a 15-minute calling card and a pager so the officials can contact him.  When he sees the news channel on the television monitors, he finally understands what has happened in his country.  He is scared and confused, but Mr. Navorski is honest and smart.  He can wait until he can depart legally or commit a crime by going out the Airport doors.

Steven is a capable person to do a film like this. He delivers a carefree and celebrating mood to the story. The setting of the movie is spacious, With a ceiling and volume large enough to fit a few aircraft in. Why are Airport terminals so high anyways? For example SFO.

Plus he doesn't have the documents needed to enter the U.S.  The man ahead of security at the airport (Stanley Tucci) gives him permission to stay at the terminal until he can leave. He really only said that because he figured Hanks wouldn't listen and would go to leave the airport illegally and get arrested. Hanks however stays at the airport waiting patiently to be allowed to go to NY. While at the Terminal he makes friends and he touches their lives and vice versa.If their is a problem with the film it's Cathline Zita Jones' flight attendent character. Jones' plays her well but still it isn't likeable how she lets him fall for her when to her he's just company until she has another flight. I mean to her he is a great guy don't get me wrong but does she share the same feelings that he has for her ? No. So I feel like she leads him on when she really just wants this married guy to divorce his wife and be with her. You want to like her and could easily fall for her like he did but...it would be a mistake. So her character is all that brings down an otherwise sweet and sentimental movie. Hanks is so good in the role though that you would follow his character anywhere so it still works.,4,Pleasant and Humorous,1101600000,"11 28, 2004",2004,1694,"['Terminal', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'chance', 'play', 'most', 'innocent', 'loveable', 'character', 'Forest', 'Gump', ""n't"", 'look', 'Russian', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'such', 'good', 'actor', 'still', 'disapear', 'role', 'hear', 'lot', 'how', 'Liam', 'Nieson', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'should', 'get', 'nominated', 'best', 'actor', 'year', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'just', 'ignore', 'Hanks', 'work', 'here', 'russian', 'stuck', 'airport', 'terminal', 'planes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fly', 'home', 'country', 'war', ""n't"", 'have', 'documents', 'needed', 'enter', 'U.S', 'man', 'ahead', 'security', 'airport', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'permission', 'stay', 'terminal', 'can', 'leave', 'really', 'only', 'said', 'figured', 'Hanks', 'would', ""n't"", 'listen', 'would', 'go', 'leave', 'airport', 'illegally', 'get', 'arrested', 'Hanks', 'however', 'airport', 'waiting', 'patiently', 'be', 'allowed', 'go', 'NY', 'Terminal', 'friends', 'lives', 'vice', 'versa.If', 'problem', 'film', 'Cathline', 'Zita', 'Jones', 'flight', 'attendent', 'character', 'Jones', 'well', 'still', ""n't"", 'likeable', 'how', 'fall', 'when', 'just', 'company', 'flight', 'mean', 'great', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'share', 'same', 'feelings', 'So', 'feel', 'when', 'really', 'just', 'married', 'guy', 'divorce', 'wife', 'be', 'want', 'like', 'could', 'easily', 'fall', 'did', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'character', 'down', 'otherwise', 'sweet', 'sentimental', 'movie', 'Hanks', 'so', 'good', 'role', 'would', 'follow', 'character', 'anywhere', 'still']",N/A

623863,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JMYC,Joe Sherry,"[1, 3]","""The Terminal"" is a vastly underrated Spielberg film. It is about a man named Victor Navorski (Tom Hanks) who finds himself exiles in the JFK airport in New York City. See, Victor is from a country called Krakosia. It's a fictional Eastern European country that while Victor was en route underwent a military coup. Since the United States no longer diplomatically recognizes Krakosia's new leadership, Victor Navorski is a man without a country and can not enter the United States nor be returned to a country which officially doesn't exist in the eyes of the United States Government. So, he is stuck in the International Terminal at JFK (there is the roots of a true story here with an incident which happened in Europe, but that's as far as it goes).What follows is Navorski winning over everyone but the man in charge of the airport who just wants to get rid of Victor but follow the letter of the law. But the official just starts to get petty, which is disappointing. Victor's basic decency shines through as he adapts to his situation and tries to eke out an existence.There are no details about the rest of the plot which are very important to note, but maybe it is the combination of Spielberg and Hanks that make ""The Terminal"" better than it should be. It is a very decent movie, and I mean that in a couple of different ways. Quality wise, it is decent. But this is also very pleasant, enjoyable movie with a heart that is filled with decency.

Everyone seems to be waiting for a little humanity. In contrast to the rushing New Yorkers, Victor is truly alien in his huge capacity to wait. As an East European who knows the crush of bureaucracy, Victor's long, patient suffering under an American bureaucracy gone insane is painfully ironic. This suffering reaches a crescendo when another Russian immigrant literally grovels on his knees, begs and cries out for justice and mercy. In the end, humanity mostly prevails, but the waiting is a terrible process. This heavy material is encapsulated in a sweet comedy that has many light laughs, so this bitter pill goes down mostly sweet. The good-natured Victor never seems to flag in spirit and several subplots of romantic love brighten the movie in golden moments of light. It's clear that the characters have to handle their wait for a little blessed humanity in whatever way they can. Some manage it terribly and become dehumanized or even simply sadistic. Most get by.

623867,AQ79DO3H5GRS2,B00005JMYC,John Wykes,"[1, 1]","Nowadays there are two Spielberg camps -- one camp praises the director for his recent daring and inventiveness, embracing projects that are original and never shoeins for commercial success; the other camp laments that Spielberg has lost his ""touch"" and wonders when, if ever, he will return to the glory days of ""Jurassic Park.""I fall into the former camp.While ""A.I."" was a clear miss, due mostly to the effort by Spielberg to keep some Kubrick elements intact while offering his own slant (therefore putting the movie smack dab in the middle of nowhere), Spielberg's more recent films have been extraordinary achievements.  Whether one considers the washed out colors and intense montage editing of ""Minority Report,"" or the breezy ""Catch Me If You Can,"" or this delicate flower of a romantic comedy called ""The Terminal,"" Spielberg is doing what so very few directors do these days -- he's taking chances.  He's daring to do something different.  And John Williams, his composer of choice for some thirty years, continues to amaze with some of the most unique scores of his career, reinventing himself in much the same way Spielberg has done.""The Terminal""'s weakest moments are in the beginning, when the film must navigate through a series of events to convince us that Tom Hanks is a man without a home.  Unable to enter New York because he has no Visa and no valid passport, and unable to go back home since a violent revolution has overthrown the government while he was in flight (thus invalidating his passport), Hanks must stay at the terminal indefinitely while the mess is sorted out.It is only at this point where the film really takes off.  Hanks makes some new friends with those who work at the airport, serves as a go-between for two airport employees who fall in love, and falls for a woman (Catherine Zeta-Jones)who is herself waiting...waiting for her life to begin.Almost the entire film takes place at the terminal (built, by the way, specifically for this film), so the plot is certainly not moved forward by sets and special effects.  Instead, it is the ordinary people who remain in focus, and their hopes and dreams that move the plot forward.Talk about taking chances -- very few directors can successfully pull off the task of directing a film in a confined setting.  Spielberg's critics, especially back in the 70's, insisted that he needed fantastic action sequences and spectacular special effects to make his films work, that he didn't have what it takes to make a simple but profound movie about human nature.  This film, as well as others, proves that Spielberg is a true master of his medium.  He directs a film that takes place mostly at potentially the most boring place in the world, an airport terminal, and pulls it off.There is a charming simplicity in this film, and it never pretends to be more than it is.  There is some fluff here but it is good, satisfying fluff -- a charming and sometimes touching portrayal of humanity at its most ordinary, and its most vulnerable.  If you want to see computer-generated dinosaurs, rent out ""Jurassic Park.""  If you want to see humans get teary eyed over alien life forms, check out ""E.T."" or ""Close Encounters.""  If you want to see a little film that touches the heart and explores the great beauty of ordinary people, ""The Terminal"" is worth a watch.",4,"Slow start, charming finish...",1101600000,"11 28, 2004",2004,3338,"['Nowadays', 'are', 'two', 'Spielberg', 'camps', 'one', 'camp', 'director', 'recent', 'daring', 'inventiveness', 'embracing', 'projects', 'are', 'original', 'never', 'shoeins', 'commercial', 'success', 'other', 'camp', 'laments', 'Spielberg', 'lost', 'touch', 'wonders', 'when', 'ever', 'will', 'return', 'glory', 'days', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'fall', 'former', 'camp.While', 'A.I', 'was', 'clear', 'miss', 'due', 'mostly', 'effort', 'Spielberg', 'keep', 'Kubrick', 'elements', 'intact', 'offering', 'own', 'slant', 'putting', 'movie', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Spielberg', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'extraordinary', 'achievements', 'one', 'washed', 'colors', 'intense', 'montage', 'editing', 'Minority', 'Report', 'breezy', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'delicate', 'flower', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'called', 'Terminal', 'Spielberg', 'doing', 'what', 'so', 'very', 'few', 'directors', 'do', 'days', 'taking', 'chances', 'daring', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'John', 'Williams', 'composer', 'choice', 'thirty', 'years', 'amaze', 'most', 'unique', 'scores', 'career', 'reinventing', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Spielberg', 'done', 'Terminal', 'weakest', 'moments', 'are', 'beginning', 'when', 'film', 'must', 'navigate', 'series', 'events', 'convince', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'man', 'home', 'Unable', 'enter', 'New', 'York', 'Visa', 'valid', 'passport', 'unable', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'violent', 'revolution', 'overthrown', 'government', 'was', 'flight', 'thus', 'invalidating', 'passport', 'Hanks', 'must', 'stay', 'terminal', 'indefinitely', 'mess', 'sorted', 'out.It', 'only', 'point', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'off', 'Hanks', 'new', 'friends', 'who', 'work', 'airport', 'go-between', 'two', 'airport', 'employees', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'woman', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'waiting', 'waiting', 'life', 'begin.Almost', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'terminal', 'built', 'way', 'specifically', 'film', 'plot', 'certainly', 'not', 'moved', 'forward', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'Instead', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'remain', 'focus', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'move', 'plot', 'forward.Talk', 'taking', 'chances', 'very', 'few', 'directors', 'can', 'successfully', 'pull', 'off', 'task', 'directing', 'film', 'confined', 'setting', 'Spielberg', 'critics', 'especially', 'back', '70', 'insisted', 'needed', 'fantastic', 'action', 'sequences', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'films', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'make', 'simple', 'profound', 'movie', 'human', 'nature', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'Spielberg', 'true', 'master', 'medium', 'film', 'place', 'mostly', 'potentially', 'most', 'boring', 'place', 'world', 'airport', 'terminal', 'charming', 'simplicity', 'film', 'never', 'be', 'more', 'fluff', 'here', 'good', 'satisfying', 'fluff', 'charming', 'sometimes', 'touching', 'portrayal', 'humanity', 'most', 'ordinary', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'want', 'see', 'computer-generated', 'dinosaurs', 'rent', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'want', 'see', 'humans', 'get', 'teary', 'eyed', 'alien', 'life', 'forms', 'check', 'E.T', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'want', 'see', 'little', 'film', 'heart', 'great', 'beauty', 'ordinary', 'people', 'Terminal', 'watch']",N/A

While in the air from Eastern Europe, his homeland of Krakozia - probably a chronic trouble spot in the Balkans - slips into a government coup. It's revoked all of its passports and, in response, the U.S. State Department has nullified all travel visas issued to Krakozian nationals. So, when going through Immigration, Viktor is told that he can neither enter the United States or fly back to the Old Country. The resident chief immigration officer, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), allows him to stay in the International Arrivals Lounge - a overnight state of limbo that eventually drags into nine months. And since Viktor never got as far as Customs, what's in that can of peanuts that he guards so closely?THE TERMINAL is built around the clever premise that you can, as frequent fliers can attest, lead a full life even if confined within the limits of an airport transit lounge: learn a foreign language, get a job, make new friends, eat well, acquire a trendy wardrobe, sleep, maintain one's personal appearance, and, if you're lucky, find Love.Stanley Tucci is excellent as Dixon, who's at first in sympathy with Viktor's plight, even going so far as to stage manage a breach in security through which he hopes Navorski will bolt into the outside world (thus becoming some other agency's problem). Eventually, however, Frank's attitude hardens after Viktor embarrasses him in front of some government inspectors. Something about a goat.I found Catherine Zeta-Jones's role as the distracted and romantically unfulfilled flight attendant Amelia vaguely unsatisfying. Perhaps it's because her on-screen appearances came at erratic moments and were all too brief. There ought to be a law against beauty such as hers.This isn't this year's Best Picture, but it is most definitely an Oscar-worthy performance by Tom Hanks.

America's favorite actor, director, and most beautiful superstar - all in one place. Sign me up!""Better read the fine print. See the writers, Jeff Nathanson and Sacha Gervasi? Their previous contributions are 'Speed 2', 'Rush Hour 2', 'The Big Tease', and (in fairness) adapting 'Catch Me If You Can' from the book. I didn't know all that going in, but I could tell something was vaguely amiss.The concept - a man without a country bureaucratically trapped in a New York airport - is intriguing. There are several cute scenes, some Chaplinesque pathos, and a surprising number of patiently-told observational moments. But there are just as many silly contrivances and cheap jokes that seem to exist merely to keep the audience awake and give the multi-ethnic supporting characters something to do.Had it not been for the dead-giveaway of a John Williams score, I wouldn't have known this was a Spielberg film. That's both a compliment and a jab.Hanks combines two skills from his past here, and well: His ability to do a heavy accent with sincerity (as in ""Forrest Gump"") and his skill at playing scenes in which he is silent and figures out inanimate objects (a la ""Cast Away""). Tucci (who should get second billing, timewise) is a critical darling that I will never like. Zeta-Jones takes a subdued, insecure tack in reading her flight attendant and it works rather well and (almost) believably opposite Hanks' schlubby protagonist.I started to say ""schlubby hero,"" but I never got invested enough emotionally in his character.

623881,A2HG5MY4YOY7N2,B00005JMYC,Kelvin H.,"[2, 2]","We have seen Tom Hanks stranded on an island in ""Cast Away,"" surviving on primordial instincts and stripped of any modern institution and influence. Now comes ""The Terminal,"" the third partnership film between Steven Spielberg and Hanks (""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"") where Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, whose survival also depends on primary necessities in a contrast world where resource this time is abundant. Citizen of a make-believe country called Krakozia, Navorski is to be kept within the confine of JFK airport as his country suffers from a military coup, thus leaving him without a country and leaving him with idle documents. With American soil off limits and no passport to retreat back home, Navorski's haven is situated within the terminal. In spite of being challenged by duration, Navorski is a man who has not lost his identity despite having no papers to prove it.I was quite surprised by Tom Hanks's performance. What appeared to be a phony accent and silly mannerisms turned out to be a genuine embodiment of a Krakozian. Forgive me for my early skepticism but Hanks did a ghastly performance in the Coen brother's disappointing ""The Ladykillers,"" so I had some truth behind my pessimistic self. I have to admit Hanks's Krakozian accent had some getting used to but as the movie progressed on, Navorski felt more like a next-door neighbor than a foreigner. The inability to decipher Hanks's Krakozian English is part of the challenge for we have all been under his situation one way or another. Moreover, as I sat on my seat laughing, I realized I was not so much laughing at Navorski's failed attempt in English but instead laughing at the misinterpretation of his listeners.As good as ""The Terminal"" is, I can't help but feel that Spielberg has become a director for hire. Not since ""Saving Private Ryan"" has Spielberg tackled a personal project. ""Minority Report"" was a great film but there was nothing Spielbergian about it. ""Catch Me If You Can"" felt a bit more personal but it did nothing to further his career. Now with the ""The Terminal,"" Spielberg still remains to me as the man who got robbed of the Academy Award for ""Saving Private Ryan."" ""The Terminal"" might have been a better film if it didn't give way to all those extra-sentimental materials. It felt forced whereas Spielberg should have just allowed the material to evolve naturally. But I guess Spielberg had to turn up the tempo considering the time we live in today, where airport security have become so strict and stressful that ""The Terminal"" would have been shunned by audiences.

An otherwise forgettable ""feel good"" movie is marred by the inclusion of lefty propaganda (watch for the ""Canadian pharmacy"" scene), and the entire basis for the plot plays into the childish notion that large institutions (like airports) are actually controlled by lone, capricious tyrants, rather than by a confusing array of local, state, and federal authorities.

Some have commented on the lack of believability in this film because most of the folks are so kind to this foreigner.  What most don't mention is the absolute ridiculousness upon which this movie is based.This poor, no-English speaking, eastern-European man is met with totally cold, callous disregard by those responsible for helping him correct the problem with his visa.  Although he cannot speak of word of English, we are supposed to believe that-in a country where tests to obtain a driver's license are printed in over 100 different languages-no one thinks to or is required to or cares to obtain an interpreter for him the entire length of the film.Anything and everything that can go wrong for Hank's character, does.  And not in a funny way, but in a way that will leave you with toe-curling frustration.  I didn't feel bad for him--I didn't smile as his luckless life--I felt a scream of frustration grow within me as this movie progressed.  Well before the end, I wanted to shoot him, or my DVD player, or...just about anything to end the misery immediately.  Months after watching the film, just the mention of its title causes feelings of frustration that affect me bodily.  (This is not what I look for when searching for a film with a ""lasting impact."")The characters are not in any way interesting.  They expect you to buy into Tom Hanks as an eastern-European?  They expect you to come to like a woman who sleeps with married men as the lead, romantic female?  They want you to believe the bureaucrats, rather than at most mindless or unsympathetic, are dastardly men who live to spoil other people's lives (in a Dilbert's boss sort of evil way)?  They want you to forgive a man who enjoys setting traps and watching people get hurt because of an unbelievable, heroic act in the end of the movie?Even the romance falls short and is not believable.  Especially the romance.  No two people were more mismatched than these two characters.  He's a likeable dork at best; not the sort of guy who lands an absolute babe.There is nothing really funny in this film; there is no drama in this film at all.The only thing you have to keep you watching is some vague hope that the wh*re who likes to sleep with other women's husbands will go for Hank's character so that she'll stop being a marriage wrecker.

623884,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JMYC,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[1, 1]","Hope, goodness, and optimism are usually insignias by the popular director Steven Spielberg and his many films.  Despite dark and gloomy material, Spielberg succeeds in turning these into positive lessons of humanity as he grabs the audience's attention and aims it towards the light.  Many think this positive perspective of humanity is sometimes a little too unrealistic, which may be true in many aspects.  However, Spielberg makes films that are easy to watch in a society drowned in misery spread by the TV and radio news where each day the audience hears a new body count. In a society such as ours it is important to highlight the good moments of humanity, which are seldom transmitted by the news.  Spielberg is one of these people that offer the world a perspective on why life is worth living and why there is a hope for humanity despite the mayhem and destruction in the world.Terminal is essentially about walls that people have built in order to protect themselves.  One of these walls is the law of traveling between nations, which requires passports, visas, and other documentation that proves an individual's identity.  Post 9/11 the United States has implemented stricter laws in regards to proving the identity of people, which often creates more headache for ordinary people.  Most people traveling between nations do not intend to do harm to the nations they are visiting as people travel with the purpose of business or pleasure.  Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks), a citizen of Krakozia, a fictional country, arrives to JFK as he is about to enter New York, the Big Apple, for some unknown reason that is connected with a peanut tin can.  After having been standing and waiting in the long line it is finally Victor's turn with the Homeland Security officer to approve his visit to the U.S., but his visit is declined.The best depiction of why Victor is declined entry to the United States is when he sits down with the newly appointed head of JFK, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), who physically demonstrates for Victor, who does not speak English, that he is a man without country.  This involves Dixon slamming his fist into a bag of potato chips, which ends up all over Victor.  Still in confusion, Victor brushes the potato chips off his shoulder and arm while they escort him into the airport terminal, which is international ground.  Inside the terminal, Victor realizes, through the news, that there has been a military coup in Krakozia and the United States does not recognize the new leadership.  This means that Victor is a man without a country and an invalid passport stranded in an international twilight zone.Quandary after quandary seem to face Victor as he remains within the terminal's walls.  Hunger assaults him, but he prevails as he finds alternate ways of discovering means to obtain the essentials of life.  Laundry and personal hygiene direct Victor to the public restrooms as visitors stare at him in bewilderment, as he washes his armpits in the bathroom faucet. The many hardships that come Victor's way hit him hard, yet he continues to do the right thing.  Despite the many difficulties Victor perseveres, as his struggle becomes an analogy for politeness, hope, and liberty.Spielberg depicts the story of Victor's stay in the terminal through a similar touch that older audience members might recognize from Frank Capra and others alike.  Yet, Spielberg leaves his own mark on the film, as it turns into a contemporary fairy-tale with scenes where Victor provides a gift certificate for new shoes for a flight attendant, Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who has slipped and broken her heel.  Scenes such as this make the story delightfully playful, as the improbable becomes probable for Victor who is the insignificant person everyone wants to win.In Terminal, the evident insignia of Spielberg emerges in the opening through Tom Hanks' character as he perseveres through adversity and remains with the audience as he develops new friendships.  Tom Hanks makes Victor believable and authentic through struggling with the English language and a heavy accent.  There are also additional aspects of the film that makes it a good film such as the cinematography, mise-en-scene, and performances by other cast members.  Ultimately, Spielberg saves the day with a solid cinematic experience enhanced by Tom Hanks' performance.",4,Spielberg's Delightfully Playful Tale of a Man's Loyalty...,1106956800,"01 29, 2005",2005,4362,"['Hope', 'goodness', 'optimism', 'are', 'usually', 'insignias', 'popular', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'many', 'films', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'material', 'Spielberg', 'turning', 'positive', 'lessons', 'humanity', 'audience', 'attention', 'light', 'Many', 'think', 'positive', 'perspective', 'humanity', 'sometimes', 'little', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'many', 'aspects', 'However', 'Spielberg', 'films', 'are', 'easy', 'watch', 'society', 'drowned', 'misery', 'spread', 'TV', 'radio', 'news', 'where', 'day', 'audience', 'new', 'body', 'count', 'society', 'such', 'ours', 'important', 'highlight', 'good', 'moments', 'humanity', 'are', 'seldom', 'transmitted', 'news', 'Spielberg', 'one', 'people', 'offer', 'world', 'perspective', 'why', 'life', 'worth', 'living', 'why', 'hope', 'humanity', 'mayhem', 'destruction', 'world.Terminal', 'essentially', 'about', 'people', 'have', 'built', 'order', 'protect', 'One', 'walls', 'law', 'traveling', 'nations', 'passports', 'visas', 'other', 'documentation', 'individual', 'identity', '9/11', 'United', 'States', 'implemented', 'stricter', 'laws', 'regards', 'proving', 'identity', 'people', 'often', 'more', 'headache', 'ordinary', 'people', 'Most', 'people', 'traveling', 'nations', 'do', 'not', 'intend', 'do', 'harm', 'nations', 'are', 'visiting', 'people', 'travel', 'purpose', 'business', 'pleasure', 'Viktor', 'Navorski', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'citizen', 'Krakozia', 'fictional', 'country', 'JFK', 'enter', 'New', 'York', 'Big', 'Apple', 'unknown', 'reason', 'connected', 'peanut', 'tin', 'can', 'having', 'been', 'standing', 'waiting', 'long', 'line', 'finally', 'Victor', 'turn', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'officer', 'approve', 'visit', 'U.S.', 'visit', 'declined.The', 'best', 'depiction', 'why', 'Victor', 'declined', 'entry', 'United', 'States', 'when', 'down', 'newly', 'appointed', 'head', 'JFK', 'Frank', 'Dixon', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'who', 'physically', 'Victor', 'who', 'not', 'speak', 'English', 'man', 'country', 'Dixon', 'slamming', 'fist', 'bag', 'potato', 'chips', 'up', 'Victor', 'Still', 'confusion', 'Victor', 'potato', 'chips', 'shoulder', 'arm', 'escort', 'airport', 'terminal', 'international', 'ground', 'terminal', 'Victor', 'news', 'been', 'military', 'coup', 'Krakozia', 'United', 'States', 'not', 'recognize', 'new', 'leadership', 'Victor', 'man', 'country', 'invalid', 'passport', 'stranded', 'international', 'twilight', 'zone.Quandary', 'quandary', 'seem', 'face', 'Victor', 'terminal', 'walls', 'Hunger', 'assaults', 'alternate', 'ways', 'discovering', 'means', 'obtain', 'essentials', 'life', 'Laundry', 'personal', 'hygiene', 'direct', 'Victor', 'public', 'restrooms', 'visitors', 'stare', 'bewilderment', 'armpits', 'bathroom', 'faucet', 'many', 'hardships', 'come', 'Victor', 'way', 'hit', 'hard', 'yet', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'many', 'difficulties', 'Victor', 'perseveres', 'struggle', 'analogy', 'politeness', 'hope', 'liberty.Spielberg', 'depicts', 'story', 'Victor', 'stay', 'terminal', 'similar', 'touch', 'older', 'audience', 'members', 'might', 'recognize', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'others', 'alike', 'Spielberg', 'own', 'mark', 'film', 'contemporary', 'fairy-tale', 'scenes', 'where', 'Victor', 'gift', 'certificate', 'new', 'shoes', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Amelia', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'slipped', 'broken', 'heel', 'Scenes', 'such', 'make', 'story', 'delightfully', 'playful', 'improbable', 'becomes', 'probable', 'Victor', 'who', 'insignificant', 'person', 'everyone', 'win.In', 'Terminal', 'evident', 'insignia', 'Spielberg', 'emerges', 'opening', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'character', 'adversity', 'audience', 'new', 'friendships', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Victor', 'believable', 'authentic', 'struggling', 'English', 'language', 'heavy', 'accent', 'are', 'also', 'additional', 'aspects', 'film', 'good', 'film', 'such', 'cinematography', 'mise-en-scene', 'performances', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'Ultimately', 'Spielberg', 'day', 'solid', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'enhanced', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'performance']",N/A

Tom Hanks stars as Victor, fresh off the plane from a small Eastern European country whose government was overthrown while he was inflight.  Until the U.S. recognizes the new regime, his passport is invalid and he cannot leave the airport, according to the security chief (Stanley Tucci).  Victor proceeds to make himself at home in the terminal, befriending some airport workers and even starting a romance with a lovely but flawed flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones).This movie is simply a joy.  Hanks' innocent-but-wise character is so likable that you are cheering for him all the way as he becomes involved in the lives of his quirky airport friends (lead by the scene-stealing Kumar Pallana), gets a good-paying airport job, and shows what a decent and caring man he is.  Tucci is perfect as the humorless security man who watches as Victor's stay in the terminal stretches to nine months.  Zeta-Jones is interesting as a troubled woman who collects men, and her character adds some reality and even saddness to the otherwise fantasy-world of Victor's airport.The Terminal is a feel-good comedy with an excellent script and an amazing set that will make you think it was really filmed in an airport.

This is a powerful masterpiece that is brilliant from beginning to end. This is the third teaming of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) & ""Catch Me If You Can"" (2002), Spielberg and Hanks' last picture together. This is the second film this year after ""The Ladykillers"" (2004) that Tom Hanks has worked on. Tom Hanks gives an Oscar worthy performance as Viktor Navorski, an eastern European immigrant whose country found itself at war while he was up on the plane that brought him to New York. His passport and paperwork are no longer valid in New York. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Amelia Warren, a flight attendant that Viktor has fallen in love with. Stanley Tucci plays Frank Dixon, the airport official of the homeland security at the terminal. While he is stuck at the terminal, he makes some friends. Chi McBride as Joe Mulroy, a baggage handler, Diego Luna as Enrique Cruz, an food service worker, Kumar Pallana as Gupta Rajan, a janitor, Zoe Saldana as Dolores Torres, an U.S. Customs and Immigration officer and Barry Shabaka Henley as Ray Thurman, who is also an U.S. Customs and Immigration officer. The cast is well uniformed and well acted. The directing by Steven Spielberg is brilliant and is one of his best films ever. The story by Andrew Niccol & Sacha Gervasi & the screenplay by Sacha Gervasi & Jeff Nathanson (who also wrote the screenplay to Catch Me If You Can) is brilliant. Most of the crew are from Spielberg's most recent movies, ""Minority Report"" (2002) & ""Catch Me If You Can"" (2002). The music by John Williams is brilliant and will certainly deserve an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score. The production design by Alex McDowell is brilliant and will certainly deserve an Oscar nomination for Best Art Direction - Set Design. The costumes by Mary Zophres is brilliant. The art direction by Christopher Burian-Mohr & Isabelle Guay and the set design by Anne Kuljian is brilliant and will join Alex McDowell for the Oscar nomination for Best Art Direction - Set Design.

623890,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMYC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","Director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks pair up for a these two attempts at light comedy.  Now the idea that Spielberg and Hanks, who worked together on ""Saving Private Ryan,"" would spend there time on this trifle might be too much for some fans to take. But then Leonardo DiCaprio, who had seen little sign of the critical success (""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"") or box office success (""Titanic"") of his earlier days was probably just happy to have had movies with Spielberg and Martin Scorsese out at the same time. Okay, so ""Catch Me If You Can"" is not a great film. It is a very good film and that puts all the parties concerned ahead of the game given the standard fare from Hollywood.The story might not be about life and death, but it is certainly compelling. Young Frank W. Abagnale Jr (DiCaprio) runs away from home rather than deal with the divorce of his parents and has to live by his wits and the checkbook in his back pocket. It turns out his wits are pretty good and he is not only able to pass millions of dollars worth of bad checks, but pass himself off as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer. Doggedly pursuing him is F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks), who knows that Frank is really a beggarman and thief. Actually, we know that Frank will get his man, because that is how the film opens, and it is as Hanratty is bringing Frank back to the United States from France that the story is revealed.""Catch Me If You Can,"" based on Abagnale's biography, is the story of an engaging rogue who uses his charm and aforementioned quick wits to get himself out of one sticky situation after another. The man had panache, which is exemplified when he has to get through the Miami airport despite the fact Hanratty has F.B.I. agents at every other line. The movie is not really a primer for a life of crime since Abagnale's did his con man act in the Sixties and technology has advanced well beyond his effective use of a bathtub full of water and model airplanes to make thousands of dollars.In addition to the questions regarding how Frank does it and how Hanratty catches him, there is the relationship between the two men as well as the relationship between Frank and his father (Christopher Walken), from whom he gets his charm and sense of larceny. It is when the film operates on this level that ""Catch Me If You Can"" becomes another classic Spielberg film, at least in the sense of the constant theme of symbolic fathers and sons, even if it never gets churned into real butter.""The Terminal"" is certainly based on a contrived situation, but there is nothing wrong with that being the case. Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) arrived in the United States at JFK Airport in New York City, clutching a bag and a can of Planter's Peanuts. Unfortunately while his plane was flying across the Atlantic there was a military coup in his native land of Krakozia. According to the bureaucrats his nation no longer exists, which means his passport is no longer valid, his visa has been rejected, and he cannot be allowed to enter the United States (that is, to go outside the airport). He cannot be allowed to return back to his warn torn country. To add insult to injury, when Customs official Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) tries to explain to Navorski why he is ""unacceptable,"" the poor guy does not understand enough English to really understand what is happening to him.Yes, you can certainly reach a translator on the phone if you do not have one on hand and the government has regulations for what happens in situations like this that do not allow people to fall through the cracks. But if we can entertain a willing suspension of disbelief to watch movies about catastrophic climatic changes and teenagers given mutant powers by the bite of a radioactive spider we can enjoy Steven Spielberg's fable about a man stuck in an airport terminal and refusing to lose his optimism or his humanity. Besides, there really was somebody who was forced to stay in an airport terminal, an Iranian refugee whose his passport and United Nations refugee certificate had been stolen (it was Charles De Gaulle Airport and French officials who refused to let the man go anywhere).Hanks, looking rather frumpy, provides another performance that shows he is at his best as a leading man when he is proving himself to be a character actor. Some of his most effective moments are when he is speaking in his foreign tongue, where the words are never understood but the emotional meanings are always clear. He plays a character that is told he cannot leave the airport terminal and so he does not leave the airport terminal. As he goes through the routines of his holding pattern keep encountering a small cast of characters including Gupta Rajan (Kumar Pallana), the janitor who likes to mop floors and watch people ignore the signs and fall on their butts, and Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the flight attendant who loses a heel on her shoe in front of Navorski doing just that. Meanwhile our hero has to deal with just surviving living in an airport terminal. Of course he does more than that, and as you would imagine he becomes something of a cult hero to those who work in the terminal as he not only endures but also perseveres.Remember that this story is not a linear narrative but one that circles around, sometimes going down and sometimes up.  You will also fall into the traps of various expectations with regards to the villain and the beautiful girl of the piece. But neither Dixon nor Amelia fits the stereotype and these somewhat rude awakenings serve to remind us that this film is about something else. That is because the biggest case of misdirection comes from the fact that we forget the question of why Navorski has come to America. This is just as well because you never would have guessed the reason and where ""The Terminal"" is different from other Spielberg movies is that the big moment really is a small moment, which is why it is the better of these two collaborations.",4,Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks pair up for light comedy,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,5985,"['Director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'actor', 'Tom',

However, once I did I was glad I took the time to watch it.  Not that it is a great movie; it is not.  But this movie is a modern fable that generally works and has a few good laughs along the way.Viktor Navorski is traveling to the United States and has just arrived in New York City.  Unfortunately, there was a war in his home country of Krakozhia and now Viktor can not enter New York and he can not return to his home country.  The friendly Department of Homeland Security person, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), advises Viktor to stay in the airport because if he leaves Dixon will have him arrested.What follows is a humorous character study.  While some may fault the movie for the lack of depth, viewers need to consider that Viktor was seeing life from a viewpoint that provided no depth, and director Stephen Spielberg exploited that lack of depth.  We slowly learn a lot about the various denizens of the airport, which includes Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna), Gupta Rajan (Kumar Pallana), Officer Torres (Zoe Saldana) and Catherine Zeta-Jones as stewardess and love-interest Amelia Warren.We soon learn that each of these people, who we see but briefly as we rush to our plane or zoom by on the way to a taxi, are three dimensional people with extraordinary backgrounds.  Even Frank Dixon has his own foibles and petty habits that are used to humorous effect.  Amelia and Viktor begin a relationship that eventually becomes the focus of the movie.  However, Viktor has a mystery that is revealed only when the time is right.There are parts of this movie that I did not enjoy.  I thought Amelia was shallow and ditzy, though her character was purposefully this way to help Viktor realize why he was in the United States.  I thought Frank Dixon was stereotypical and far too callous and vindictive.  I was particularly puzzled by his actions at the end of the movie, which seemed uncharacteristic given all that came before.  I think Spielberg was trying to show that anyone can become a better person given the right circumstances, but I was not convinced.On the other hand, there was a lot about this movie that I enjoyed.  It was funny in a lot of places.  It was also heart-warming in places.  Once Viktor's secret was revealed (which you will have to discover for yourself), Amelia's purpose in the movie became clear to me.  Indeed, a viewer should recognize that Viktor was tempted to stray from his mission, and he nearly did, but in the end the resolution that kept him going through the months in the airport was what allowed him to keep his focus.  The end of the movie is somewhat like a Frank Capra movie, but we need more movies like that as an alternative to the mind-numbing violence, sex and special effects that accompany so many movies in place of a plot.I am a little surprised by the PG-13 rating, because the movie was relatively tame and I think I would allow most children to ages 7 or 8 watch it, though there are a lot of things they would not understand.  I would hesitate to call this movie a family movie, unless your children are teenagers.If you are looking for a diversion, and a few laughs, and you can tolerate a slightly less than happy ending, then give this movie a shot.",4,Tom Hanks Is Always Charming,1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,3299,"['over-hyped', 'movies', 'had', 'difficulty', 'forcing', 'watching', 'one', 'However', 'once', 'did', 'was', 'glad', 'took', 'time', 'watch', 'Not', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'movie', 'modern', 'fable', 'generally', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'way.Viktor', 'Navorski', 'traveling', 'United', 'States', 'just', 'arrived', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'war', 'home', 'country', 'Krakozhia', 'now', 'Viktor', 'can', 'not', 'enter', 'New', 'York', 'can', 'not', 'return', 'home', 'country', 'friendly', 'Department', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'person', 'Frank', 'Dixon', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Viktor', 'stay', 'airport', 'Dixon', 'will', 'have', 'humorous', 'character', 'study', 'may', 'fault', 'movie', 'lack', 'depth', 'viewers', 'need', 'consider', 'Viktor', 'was', 'seeing', 'life', 'viewpoint', 'provided', 'depth', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'exploited', 'lack', 'depth', 'slowly', 'learn', 'lot', 'various', 'denizens', 'airport', 'Enrique', 'Cruz', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'Gupta', 'Rajan', 'Kumar', 'Pallana', 'Officer', 'Torres', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'stewardess', 'love-interest', 'Amelia', 'Warren.We', 'soon', 'learn', 'people', 'who', 'see', 'briefly', 'rush', 'plane', 'zoom', 'way', 'taxi', 'are', 'three', 'dimensional', 'people', 'extraordinary', 'backgrounds', 'Even', 'Frank', 'Dixon', 'own', 'foibles', 'petty', 'habits', 'are', 'used', 'humorous', 'effect', 'Amelia', 'Viktor', 'begin', 'relationship', 'eventually', 'focus', 'movie', 'However', 'Viktor', 'mystery', 'revealed', 'only', 'when', 'time', 'right.There', 'are', 'parts', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'thought', 'Amelia', 'was', 'shallow', 'ditzy', 'character', 'was', 'purposefully', 'way', 'help', 'Viktor', 'realize', 'why', 'was', 'United', 'States', 'thought', 'Frank', 'Dixon', 'was', 'stereotypical', 'far', 'too', 'callous', 'vindictive', 'was', 'particularly', 'puzzled', 'actions', 'end', 'movie', 'seemed', 'uncharacteristic', 'given', 'came', 'think', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'anyone', 'can', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'given', 'right', 'circumstances', 'was', 'not', 'convinced.On', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'lot', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'funny', 'lot', 'places', 'was', 'also', 'heart-warming', 'places', 'Once', 'Viktor', 'secret', 'was', 'revealed', 'will', 'have', 'discover', 'Amelia', 'purpose', 'movie', 'became', 'clear', 'Indeed', 'viewer', 'should', 'recognize', 'Viktor', 'was', 'tempted', 'stray', 'mission', 'nearly', 'did', 'end', 'resolution', 'kept', 'going', 'months', 'airport', 'was', 'what', 'allowed', 'keep', 'focus', 'end', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'movie', 'need', 'more', 'movies', 'like', 'alternative', 'mind-numbing', 'violence', 'sex', 'special', 'effects', 'accompany', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'place', 'plot.I', 'am', 'little', 'surprised', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'movie', 'was', 'relatively', 'tame', 'think', 'would', 'allow', 'most', 'children', 'ages', '7', '8', 'watch', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'would', 'not', 'understand', 'would', 'hesitate', 'call', 'movie', 'family', 'movie', 'children', 'are', 'are', 'looking', 'diversion', 'few', 'laughs', 'can', 'tolerate', 'slightly', 'less', 'happy', 'ending', 'then', 'give', 'movie', 'shot']",N/A

In THE TERMINAL, he presents an initially believable premise that soon morphs into a touchy feely ending that allows all wrongs to be set right.  Spielberg takes the true story of an Iranian immigrant who, through no fault of his own, was stranded in Kennedy Airport, and adds to it a series of supporting characters who, by the film's end, march in solidarity to rout the forces of an intrusive government bureaucracy.  Tom Hanks is Viktor Navorsky, who is headed from a fictional eastern European nation to Kennedy Airport.  On route, he discovers that his government has been overthrown, his passport rendered invalid, and he himself is now stateless.  So far so good, but Spielberg felt the need to balance Navorsky's essential goodness against the uncompromising lack of compassion evinced by the airport's chief of security (Stanley Tucci). It is a big pill to swallow to accept that everyone else in the film, including Tucci's own security people, are really rooting for Navorsky to be granted permission to exit the airport legally.  Hanks, speaking both a fractured English and a Russian dialect that is reasonably Slavic to the trained Russian ear, is convincing as the Man With No Country.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, as Amelia the flight attendant who takes a shine to Viktor, is much less convincing as the ""other woman"" in a relation with a married man.  The Zeta-Jones character is your stereotypical ""stay away from me because I am all messed up"" female, who in one scene wants to grow close to Viktor, then in the next backs away, and then still in the next, changes her mind once again.The major problem I had with THE TERMINAL has nothing to do with Hanks.  Rather, Spielberg goes for the cheap feel good connection of audience sympathy for Viktor. How can anyone possibly root against a guy who not only manages to survive on his own in a foreign airport, but also manages to speak quite adequate colloquial English half way through?  This is on top of making more money as a union carpenter than does the Tucci character as head of airport security.  Further, Spielberg peppers the supporting cast with the requisite and proportional ethnic mix of Hispanic, Afro-American, and Indian, all of whom are prepared to risk their personal freedom to support Viktor in his pursuit of a visa.  I do not believe THE TERMINAL is meant as an allegory of heavy handed bureaucracy.  It seems more likely that Spielberg wanted to place Hanks in a reverse of his earlier CAST AWAY role as a fish out of water who needs to adapt to survive.  In both roles Hanks suggests that survival can be seen as darkly serious or lightly humorous.  How one interprets it is more a function of the audience than the director.",3,Through a Tinted Glass: Lightly,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,2791,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'made', 'career', 'allowing', 'grownups', 'act', 'children', 'THE', 'TERMINAL', 'initially', 'believable', 'premise', 'soon', 'morphs', 'touchy', 'feely', 'ending', 'wrongs', 'be', 'set', 'right', 'Spielberg', 'true', 'story', 'Iranian', 'immigrant', 'who', 'fault', 'own', 'was', 'stranded', 'Kennedy', 'Airport', 'series', 'supporting', 'characters', 'who', 'film', 'end', 'march', 'solidarity', 'rout', 'forces', 'intrusive', 'government', 'bureaucracy', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Viktor', 'Navorsky', 'who', 'headed', 'fictional', 'eastern', 'European', 'nation', 'Kennedy', 'Airport', 'route', 'government', 'been', 'overthrown', 'passport', 'rendered', 'invalid', 'now', 'stateless', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'Spielberg', 'felt', 'need', 'balance', 'Navorsky', 'essential', 'goodness', 'uncompromising', 'lack', 'compassion', 'evinced', 'airport', 'chief', 'security', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'big', 'pill', 'swallow', 'accept', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'including', 'Tucci', 'own', 'security', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'rooting', 'Navorsky', 'be', 'granted', 'permission', 'exit', 'airport', 'legally', 'Hanks', 'speaking', 'fractured', 'English', 'Russian', 'dialect', 'reasonably', 'Slavic', 'trained', 'Russian', 'ear', 'convincing', 'Man', 'Country', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Amelia', 'flight', 'attendant', 'who', 'shine', 'Viktor', 'much', 'less', 'convincing', 'other', 'woman', 'relation', 'married', 'man', 'Zeta-Jones', 'character', 'stereotypical', 'stay', 'away', 'am', 'messed', 'up', 'female', 'who', 'one', 'scene', 'grow', 'close', 'Viktor', 'then', 'next', 'away', 'then', 'still', 'next', 'mind', 'again.The', 'major', 'problem', 'had', 'THE', 'TERMINAL', 'nothing', 'do', 'Hanks', 'Rather', 'Spielberg', 'cheap', 'feel', 'good', 'connection', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'Viktor', 'How', 'can', 'anyone', 'possibly', 'root', 'guy', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'survive', 'own', 'foreign', 'airport', 'also', 'speak', 'quite', 'adequate', 'colloquial', 'English', 'half', 'way', 'top', 'making', 'more', 'money', 'union', 'carpenter', 'Tucci', 'character', 'head', 'airport', 'security', 'Further', 'Spielberg', 'supporting', 'cast', 'requisite', 'proportional', 'ethnic', 'mix', 'Hispanic', 'Afro-American', 'Indian', 'whom', 'are', 'prepared', 'risk', 'personal', 'freedom', 'support', 'Viktor', 'pursuit', 'visa', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'THE', 'TERMINAL', 'meant', 'allegory', 'heavy', 'handed', 'bureaucracy', 'more', 'likely', 'Spielberg', 'wanted', 'place', 'Hanks', 'reverse', 'earlier', 'CAST', 'AWAY', 'role', 'fish', 'water', 'who', 'adapt', 'survive', 'roles', 'Hanks', 'survival', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'darkly', 'serious', 'lightly', 'humorous', 'How', 'one', 'more', 'function', 'audience', 'director']",N/A

In the end, he is able to return to his homeland in triumph, having completed a lifelong quest to get an autograph to complete the collection of his dead father. The first third of the movie was terrific; seeing Hanks learning how to cope with his airport life, and the early annoyances of Stanley Tucci, was a lot of fun. In the second third of the movie, the plot starts to come apart a little bit. A romance between a baggage handler and a customer service representative becomes the focus for a while, and Hanks pursues a relationship with stewardess Zeta-Jones. Some of the scenes begin to ring a little false, and the dialogue begins to feel a little strained. Zeta-Jones starts to seem annoying rather than charming. In the final act, a huge tidal wave of schmaltz rolls in, obliterating everything in its path. The baggage handler gets married in an amazingly unbelievable sequence.

Hanks sacrifices his dream for his airport friends, and they in turn sacrifice themselves for his dream.

He can't enter the U.S. without a visa, and he can't go home because his passport is no longer recognized by the United States since his goverment isn't functional. He's a small crack in a huge system and all of this is explained to him from Security Director Frank Dixon(Tucci). He can do one thing and that is stay in the airport. He can't leave the terminal until peace is established and the U.S. will recognize his leaders.Viktor doesn't understand it at first but quickly catches on. He has no money, because his countries money is no good. He's given a few provisions by the airport, but he quickly loses them. So he does what Dixon says, and he stays in the terminal.He quickly starts to learn in the terminal. He eats crackers with ketchup and mustard for a while until he finds an easy way to get money. He lives in gate 67 which is closed for repairs. He fins an alternative source for food when he meets Enrique(Diego) a gourmet food supplier who quickly gives him food for information about one of the woman in the airport that he loves. They become friends along with Enriques other comrades Ray and Gupta(Henley & Pallana).While in the Terminal Viktor gets a job with the construction crew. He starts earning good money and he meets a woman that he quickly is enchanted by. Amelia(Jones) is a flight attendant at the airport. She is in there every couple of weeks and is dating a married man. She isn't happy with her life and Viktor tries to change that. There friendship develops and we find out the reason that Viktor came to America. I won't reveal anymore of the story because I don't want to spoil anymore.Tom Hanks is the man in this movie. He delivers the best performance of 2004 to this date with the character Viktor Navorski. His accent is fantastic and he even changes the normal way that he walks to play him. Like he did in Philadelphia, he becomes the character and you no longer see Tom Hanks. That's he's one of the best in the business, because of the so many memorable characters he's been. This is one of the best he's done and he has to be the early Oscar favorite.This is a limited role for Catherine Zeta Jones. She doesn't get a lot of screen time, but when she's on it she's memroable. It's a totally different look for one of the worlds most beautiful woman and she pulls it off. Some say this role is a waste of the Oscar winners talents, but they are so wrong. There isn't a trace of her heavy Welsh accent at all in the movie. She plays Amelia to perfection. She is easily one of the most talented actresses in the world and she doesn't disappoint.Only Spielberg could have made this movie. Everything is perfectly done in it. You feel like you are in an actual airport. Everything is authentic. This is one of the best sets ever done in a movie. The shots are great and this movie is so well made. Spielberg is a perfectionist and you can tell that by how well made this is.The story in this moive is awesome. It's a great tale of love and frienship. The theater I was in had people cheering and some were crying. It does drag at times, but it's not that bad. There are a lot of characters and all are developed well. We see a complete change in a man, and it couldn't have been done well in a 90 minute movie.I love this moive. In my opinion it's the best movie of the year to this date. I've seen it twice and the left the theater smiling and happy each time. It's another classic from two of the best in the business with Hanks and Spielberg. Go see The Terminal and prepare yourself for a great time.",5,A Fantastic Story,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,4068,"['hate', 'admit', 'idea', 'Terminal', 'little', 'far', 'fetched', 'Skeptics', 'can', 'bash', 'movie', 'want', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2004', 'master', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'two', 'best', 'business', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones.Viktor', 'Navorski', 'Hanks', 'Republic', 'Karhozi', 'come', 'America', 'landed', 'JFK', 'airport', 'was', 'air', 'country', 'was', 'overtaken', 'local', 'rebels', 'passport', 'no', 'longer', 'legal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'visa', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enter', 'U.S.', 'visa', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'home', 'passport', 'no', 'longer', 'recognized', 'United', 'States', 'goverment', ""n't"", 'functional', 'small', 'crack', 'huge', 'system', 'explained', 'Security', 'Director', 'Frank', 'Dixon', 'Tucci', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'stay', 'airport', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'terminal', 'peace', 'established', 'U.S.', 'will', 'recognize', 'leaders.Viktor', ""n't"", 'understand', 'first', 'quickly', 'catches', 'money', 'countries', 'money', 'good', 'given', 'few', 'provisions', 'airport', 'quickly', 'So', 'what', 'Dixon', 'terminal.He', 'quickly', 'learn', 'terminal', 'crackers', 'ketchup', 'mustard', 'while', 'easy', 'way', 'get', 'money', 'gate', '67', 'closed', 'repairs', 'alternative', 'source', 'food', 'when', 'Enrique', 'Diego', 'gourmet', 'food', 'supplier', 'who', 'quickly', 'food', 'information', 'one', 'woman', 'airport', 'become', 'friends', 'Enriques', 'other', 'comrades', 'Ray', 'Gupta', 'Henley', 'Pallana', '.While', 'Terminal', 'Viktor', 'job', 'construction', 'crew', 'earning', 'good', 'money', 'woman', 'quickly', 'enchanted', 'Amelia', 'Jones', 'flight', 'attendant', 'airport', 'couple', 'weeks', 'dating', 'married', 'man', ""n't"", 'happy', 'life', 'Viktor', 'tries', 'change', 'friendship', 'develops', 'find', 'out', 'reason', 'Viktor', 'came', 'America', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'anymore', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anymore.Tom', 'Hanks', 'man', 'movie', 'best', 'performance', '2004', 'date', 'character', 'Viktor', 'Navorski', 'accent', 'fantastic', 'even', 'normal', 'way', 'play', 'did', 'Philadelphia', 'character', 'no', 'longer', 'see', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'one', 'best', 'business', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'characters', 'been', 'one', 'best', 'done', 'be', 'early', 'Oscar', 'favorite.This', 'limited', 'role', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'when', 'memroable', 'totally', 'different', 'look', 'one', 'worlds', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'off', 'say', 'role', 'waste', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'talents', 'are', 'so', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'trace', 'heavy', 'Welsh', 'accent', 'movie', 'Amelia', 'perfection', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'actresses', 'world', ""n't"", 'disappoint.Only', 'Spielberg', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'Everything', 'perfectly', 'done', 'feel', 'are', 'actual', 'airport', 'Everything', 'authentic', 'one', 'best', 'sets', 'ever', 'done', 'movie', 'shots', 'are', 'great', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'Spielberg', 'perfectionist', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'well', 'made', 'is.The', 'story', 'moive', 'awesome', 'great', 'tale', 'love', 'frienship', 'theater', 'was', 'had', 'people', 'cheering', 'were', 'crying', 'drag', 'times', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'lot', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'well', 'see', 'complete', 'change', 'man', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'done', 'well', '90', 'minute', 'movie.I', 'love', 'moive', 'opinion', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'date', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', 'left', 'theater', 'smiling', 'happy', 'time', 'classic', 'two', 'best', 'business', 'Hanks', 'Spielberg', 'Go', 'see', 'Terminal', 'prepare', 'great', 'time']",N/A
623908,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B00005JMYC,M. Burns,"[62, 71]","A noted critic is famous for saying that the worst movie the Marx brothers could ever make would still be better than most films out there. That's how director Steven Spielberg is these days - though not at the top of his critical or popular peak, he continues to make movies that - though not shoo-ins for a Top 100 list - are 'good.' Case in point: The Terminal is the worst movie he's made in a decade, and I still had a pretty good time.If anything, The Terminal (like Young Adam with Ewan McGregor) proves that an immensely talented star and American Everyman like Tom Hanks can rise above just about anything and make it worthwhile. His plight as the immigrant stuck in the airport terminal is alternately hilarious, touching, and so incredibly nuanced that you do - believe me on this - forget it's a megastar playing the role. Hanks plays the role with a Chaplinesque grace that compliments everyone around him, especially airport workers Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana, and Zoe Saldana. And the movie works...to a point. What I found most shocking about Terminal is that it really comes apart with the introduction of the plot strand involing Catherine Zeta-Jones' flight attendant. Her Amelia is a schlocky, As the World Turns-inspired piece of character writing that is too often contrived and sappy. And unconvincing at that - quite a feat considering Zeta-Jones is the most beautiful woman on the planet.I don't really know what was going through the minds of writers Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson when they decided to throw this movie away in its final act. This movie has so much wistful charm it's easy to throw off the 'Amelia situation' and succeed, but the plot spotlight hits her too much near the end; and it gets so sappy. Ebert hails Spielberg as an American director who can make audiences cry without manipulation, but The Terminal becomes too noodging as one act of kindness after another guides the movie to its close. And I admired the film's aim for simplicity in its final tie of the plot strands (yes, this movie turns on a peanut canister), but as the credits rolled, I felt a vague feeling of dissatisfaction (a la A.I.).It's difficult to really judge a movie like this. The charm, heart, and wit displayed in most of it is enough to keep it afloat despite some serious missteps, but let me take a minute and be unfair. This is a director who has helmed some of the most enduring works of American film...so why didn't he notice some the soap opera-ish writing and cheesiness that pops up too often in this film? I look toward the movie's faults more because I know they could have been fixed: Amelia could have been more believable, the movie could have left out some ""awww"" moments at the end, and it could have trimmed off about 10 minutes. Had The Terminal taken the time to match the perfection of the film's first half, it would have been one of the best movies of the year. I had such a great time for a while, and wanted to follow it to even greater things. Even now, though, it's a warm, engaging little comedy stuck in an overlong melodrama's body.

Tom Hanks & Catherine Zeta Jones characters never get anywhere, and CZJ's character really could have been cut out of the film, she was that pointless to the plot. But she was pretty in it. That's pretty much all she does. And guys seem to have a thing for air hostesses, particularly their uniforms. But really, she was pointless, especially when they don't get together. :(The film is inspired by the story of Merhan Nasseri, an Iranian refugee. In 1988, he landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris after being denied entry into England because his passport and United Nations refugee certificate had been stolen. French authorities would not let him leave the airport. He remained in Terminal One, a stateless person with nowhere else to go. He has since been granted permission to either enter France or return to his own country. He instead chooses to continue to live in the terminal and tell his story to those who will listen. As of the summer of 2004, he is still living in the airport.I loved the fact that the airport set was so realistic, but hello, was there a bit too much product placement there?!Tom Hanks is perfect for this role, and he plays it well, a struggling foreigner with little grasp of the English language. The language he is actually speaking is actually Bulgarian. I love the fact he managed to work out he could get money by returning the airport trolley things, and was disappointed when the fabulous Stanley Tucci got wind of this.I can see why many reviewers give this film one or two stars. It's not really that exciting and nothing really happens in it. It's just a story about a guy's life, trying to do what he wanted to do. And Steven Spielberg has managed to stretch it really thin across it's 2+hours of running time. It gets a bit repetitive towards the end, and you're just longing for it to end.See this film if you want an interesting look at what Steven Spielberg seems to think goes on behind the scenes in an airport.

""The Terminal"" is an endearing little movie. Yes, the plot is pretty unrealistic, but who cares? Tom Hanks plays Victor Navorski, an Eastern European who arrives at JFK International Airport in New York City just as a military coup has overtaken the government in his homeland. As a result, Navorski has no valid citizenship, and airport officials inform him that he is not allowed to enter the United States and cannot return back to his own country: he is literally banished to the airport. Victor manages to make the most of his situation, finding gainful employment and even wooing a [slightly unstable] flight attendant (Catherine Zeta Jones).Hanks is the best part of this movie, by far. I'm not sure if this film would have worked with any other actor in the leading role, but watching Hanks saw apart airport seats to furnish a comfortable bed and race around the airport returning baggage carts in order to earn a few quarters really warms your heart. Zeta Jones delivers a solid performance in her supporting role, and Stanley Tucci is great as the uptight terminal director. Kumar Pallana also has a great supporting role as a janitor. (People who saw him in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" will delight in the fact that he performs all the juggling/plate-spinning tricks that he did in the bonus features of the ""Tenenbaums"" DVD!)

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[0, 0]","THE TERMINAL is the most charming film that director Steven Spielberg has made in years.Inspired by an actual incident, the touching comedy stars Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski, a non-English-speaking citizen from a small, imaginary Eastern European country who arrives at New York's JFK airport only to learn that a revolution has taken place in his nation.  Thus, because of bureaucratic glitches, he cannot legally enter the United States, nor can he return home.Navorski is forced to remain inside the airport terminal until his situation can be rectified.Inside the vast terminal, which, incidentally, is a fabulous set that, along with Hanks' brilliant nuanced performance, deserved to be (but wasn't) recognized come Oscar time, Viktor must learn to survive.He finds a place to sleep in an unfinished part of the building, makes friends among the airport workers and even finds employment as a construction worker.Viktor also finds romance in the person of Catherine Zeta-Jones, an airline stewardess who is involved in a dead-end affair with a married man.Stanley Tucci plays the head of airport security.  He's not an evil man, but the fact that Hanks is stuck in his terminal for month-after-month might prevent him from getting the promotion that he's been seeking for years.  Therefore, he must find a way to rid himself of this thorn-in-his-side, using fair means or foul, even if it means that Hanks will wind up in prison.Chi McBride and Diego Luna are also in the cast.

Spiderman 2, The Bourne Supremacy, Collateral, Anchorman, Aliens vs. Predator, all films I am dying to see, no doubt. But, those are granted films I'm going to walk out of happy and fulfilled. Now with certain films, the ones you decide to go see, that's where enjoyment is really, something extraordinary. Take for tonight, 'The Terminal', starring Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta Jones, was one of those rarities. I walked out of this film satisfied and I would like to explain why.'The Terminal' is by far one of Spielberg's most indirect projects I have ever seen. It was never hyped, it was never planned for the longest time, it just was. But, for some reason, it has this look that shines above many of Spielberg's works. From the certain lighting to the timid, noble acting of Tom Hanks, there is a difference mixture here and I think anyone who has seen a Spielberg movie should see this.The film is simple, but it's different, that alone makes it intriguing. But, the trailers to me weren't, they made me actually NOT want to see the film, something rare when the name Spielberg was attached. What the trailer didn't show is what couldn't be shown. This film is a walking painting, there is so much to see and so much to love that no three minutes will pull you in.You're taken into this world, a new world, a new country...Terminal 67. Hanks plays a Russian-esque civilian coming to NY and is stuck in this new area. Much like a pseudo-Dawn of the Dead, he makes this his living area, and that's when things become interesting. From the uncanny, mall like lounge that featurs a Borders, Hugo Boss, Brookstone, etc to the dilapidated past that is being redone, everything shines here and we are enveloped into this world that someone adapts into.Spielberg's work is amazing. Atleast in this film. I kept finding myself saying, 'Nice shot', 'Beautiful', or 'Wow.' The colors he has are so, clear, so high definition, and in a way, they paralell with the late Stanley Kubrick. You just really should see it to see what and where I am coming from.The subplots and everything really pull you in. You want to know what is going to happen next, it's like what Pigvomit said in Private Parts, the people watch Howard to see what happens. This is entirely the case here. The different things Hanks does for people and the extraordinary characteristics of different people are really intriguing. Contrary to what most reviewers said, CNN being one them, many of the interactions are not inplausible, and even so, this is like reading a book, almost imagination, but really, it is rather realistic.To me, this is a surprise. I know many here won't like this picture, many will consider it boring, but I don't see how. It's not a campy love story, it's a story of just how far one will go and how can they. It's decent. That could be my review there, it's decent. It didn't pop out and make me go insane like Catch Me If You Can or Saving Private Ryan, but it made me think and say, 'interesting.' I say that's much more rewarding than a few cheap laughs and thrills at say, Riddick or the bland, Dodgeball.It's a really different kind of film and for a summer with so many holes in hit films, this really shines, at least for, at least until June 30th when the ride begins.Spielberg, I applaud, not a standing ovation, but a pat on the back.

This take on the tale is a romantic dramedy set in New York's JFK Airport. Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is a traveler visiting the United States from the fictional Eastern European Republic of Krakozhia, which has suffered a military coup while Victor was in flight. Without a recognized government, all passports issued by Krakozhia are suspended and all visas revoked. Victor is stranded. The airport's chief of security, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) confines him to the International Transit Lounge at JFK until things are sorted out in his homeland. While he waits, Victor develops friendships with airport staff, gets mixed up in customs issues, and romances a flight attendant, Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). All the while, a vindictive Dixon tries every method he can devise to get Victor to leave the airport so that he will be some other law enforcement agency's problem.Tom Hanks is affable and charming in his usual way. Catherine Zeta-Jones is given little to do except look pretty. Stanley Tucci makes Dixon appropriately unlikable, but Dixon's behavior is rarely clearly motivated. He seems to be there only because the film needs a conflict. Most of ""The Terminal"" is spent watching Victor bungle his way around the Transit Lounge trying to find ways to make money or win the lady. I suppose this is supposed to be funny or sympathetic. It is for a while, but it's endless. There just isn't much story. ""The Terminal"" is a Tom Hanks vehicle with almost nothing hitched to it.

I haven't been thrilled with Hanks role choices of the past few years (""The Green Mile"", ""Cast Away"", ""The Ladykillers"", ""The Road to Perdition"", ""Catch Me if You Can"").  In fact, I haven't paid to see a Tom Hanks movie since the disappointing ""Cast Away"".  My biggest hesitation with seeing this film was the idea of someone as famous as Tom Hanks, who carries a baggage of likeable funny guy in goofy romantic comedies, trying to pass himself off as a fumbling foreigner with communication difficulties as he lives in an airport for months until his country resolves their political crisis.  So, what a surprise I was in for when I watched this film.  Tom Hanks did an outstanding job...because I forgot he was ""Tom Hanks"" and easily saw him as an Eastern European trying to communicate with people and deal with the bureaucratic redtape that keeps getting thrown in his way.  He nailed the mannerisms and speech/accent of the Eastern Europeans I've known.  This is probably his best acting role since ""Forrest Gump"" and definitely worthy of another Oscar nomination.One shocker to me in this film were the several moments when Catherine Zeta Jones looked eeriely like Meg Ryan and even spoke/acted like her in a few scenes.  I couldn't believe it was Zeta Jones for a few minutes, because her resemblence to Meg Ryan in two specific incidents were startling (one when she chides herself for asking him out to lunch again, right outside the bookstore).  I don't know if that was intentional on her part, but it was amazing to witness.Overall the story works well and marvelously, with the humourous sidekicks (though at times unbelievably contrived) and the different challenges that go with living, acquiring money to buy food, and ultimately finding work all in the confines of an airport lounge.  They do play up a bit on the reasons for why Tom Hanks' character comes to America (stretching the mystery out until nearly the end) and that reasoning doesn't seem to jibe with the real world, but it somehow works for this film.

623938,A20ZFWGBY4REFX,B00005JMYC,"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan""","[4, 5]","I finally managed to check out ""The Terminal"" a couple of weeks ago at the theater, and I must say that I, for one, was really impressed with the way Academy Award-winning director Steven Spielberg (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Schindler's List"") had outdone himself with this wonderfully lighthearted comedy-drama which is sure to be the best Spielberg film since his recent hit comedy-adventure, ""Catch Me If You Can""! Spielberg's direction of ""The Terminal"" could not be better! The performance of two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks (Best Actor, 1993 and 1994: ""Philadelphia"" and ""Forrest Gump"") was brilliant, funny, and top-notch! This is possibly Hanks' best performance since ""Sleepless in Seattle""! The performance of fellow Academy Award winner Catherine Zeta-Jones (Best Supporting Actress, 2002: ""Chicago"") was charming, sweet, and unforgettable! Rounding out the cast are Stanley Tucci (""Road to Perdition""), Chi McBride (TV's ""Boston Public""), Diego Luna (""Open Range"", ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights""), Kumar Pallana (""The Royal Tenenbaums""), and Zoe Saldana (""Crossroads"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl""), in which they, too, gave excellent performances alongside the two leads.""The Terminal"" focuses on Viktor Navorski (Hanks), an eager, disheveled traveler from Eastern Europe. After arriving at his gate at New York's JFK International Airport, Viktor is getting ready to pass through customs when he learns that he can't go anywhere. The reason is that there has been a military coup in his native (and fictional) country of Krakozhia, and his passport is rendered invalid. Officially, he's a ""citizen of nowhere"", ordered to stay within the confines of the International Transit Lounge. Viktor, who speaks fragments of English, carries an old Planters peanuts tin around with him, and its mystery contents, we gather, are connected to the reason for his journey. Will he ever make it to Manhattan--or, more precisely, to the Ramada Inn on Lexington Avenue? Oh the sadness, the irony of it! He has arrived to fulfill his dream in America, and they won't even let him in!You'd think it would be a temporary problem. The snarly, rulebound security officer, Frank Dixon (Tucci), would like to be rid of Viktor, he even tries to goad him into escaping. But Viktor is a dutiful and passive soul, and he won't even venture out. Viktor remains at the airport in limbo, and the hours stretch into days, weeks, months. Viktor is given food vouchers, which he promptly loses, and he gets shunted around without any thought to his physical comfort. But luckily for Viktor, he takes all of it in stride. He returns stray baggage carts for the reward of a quarter apiece to obtain food, and he appears to hone his English by reading the ticker on TV news channels, mostly to check on Krakozhia's situation. But Spielberg, working from a script by Sachi Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson (the story is by Gervasi and Andrew Niccol of ""The Truman Show""), turns Viktor's stay at JFK mostly into a fish-out-of-water lark. During his stay in the airport, Viktor makes the most of his time by befriending many of the airport employees, including a baggage handler (McBride), a coyle hostile Indian santitation worker (Pallana), who enjoys watching people slip on freshly cleaned floors even after the ""Wet Floor"" signs have been placed on the surface, and Viktor agrees to play Cupid for Enrique (Luna), who's secretly in love with a sexy customs officer named Torres (Saldana). Viktor also develops a chaste flirtation of his own: He keeps running into Amelia Warren (Zeta-Jones), a breathless flight attendant whose romantic life is a case study in doormat cluelessness. She falls in love with Viktor while also being drawn to his deep-down nobility.In conclusion, the team of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg is going strong and could not be better, especially because ""The Terminal"", by far, could be their best work together since ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Catch Me If You Can""! ""The Terminal"" has everything that a comedy-drama should have: a splendid all-star cast and the great characters that they portray, laugh-out-loud humor, remarkable storytelling, heartfelt emotion, and a great soundtrack that Academy Award-winning composer John Williams (""Minority Report"", The ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Star Wars"" films) can provide us with!

623939,A1129LM24YWSZV,B00005JMYC,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[2, 3]","The Terminal, starring Tom Hanks, Stanley Tucci, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, revolves around an Eastern European man who is stranded in JFK international airport. (While in flight, a military coup occurs in his country, which renders his passport invalid. He becomes a man without a country.) He stays in the airport for several months, waiting for conditions in his country to change.Some of the scenes in the movie were the saddest, sweetest scenes that I've seen on screen in quite a while. When Victor (Hanks) is briefed by airport officials about what has happened in his country, his limited English prevents him from understanding. It is only later, when he sees images of his country on an airport television, that he begins to comprehend what has occurred. He becomes almost hysterical. Again, his limited English prevents him from fully understanding the news reports, and no one will help him use a phone card to call home and learn news of his loved ones. He is basically left to fend for himself in the airport terminal.In scenes like these, it seemed to me that Spielberg was really trying to emphasize the isolation of American culture, especially that of big cities. (Very Hopper-esque.) Everyone is too busy to help. No one takes pity on Victor. And the fact that almost the entire movie takes place in an airport terminal - a transitional space, not a destination, people are neither here nor there, they are only almost somewhere - seemed to illustrate the transience of life.Slowly, Victor acclimates to life in the terminal (!), and our faith in humanity is restored. Even in a bustling airport, Victor begins to make friends, people begin to help him. (As Victor is befriended by the airport staff members, I started to feel much better about the movie. Coming from a small city, the story of the good samaritan is something that I'm much more familiar with. I can't imagine someone being abandoned at the Jackson International Airport, for goodness sakes! I know that someone would take pity on him!)Victor is always waiting, and we learn throughout the movie that other characters are waiting, too - for love, for the other shoe to drop, for their dreams to be fulfilled. Victor learns, as do some of the other characters, that life is what is happening while we are waiting for life to happen.

I gotta say, it's not a good film.  That's pretty surprising considering who was involved.Okay, first, Tom Hanks was just toooo cute as the (what was it?) Kurashyanian guy or whatever.  The accent and and mock innocence, oh barf, that turned me like immediately.  So I was skeptical from the start, and that probably led me to find other flaws.  The problem was there were plenty, and while we're at it, quite a few continuity flaws too, way too many.Canadian signs at a NY airport?  Huh?  ""Bruxelles"" on a destination sign?  Medicine bottles multiplying between shots?  The candle lighting scene?  There were a couple others I caught, after awhile I started to look.  I think I saw a guy with headphones on in one of the windows, maybe a camera operator.  Was it as bad as the microphone appearing at the top of the frame in ""Walking Tall"" (my all time favorite goof)?  No, but you expect a more professional effort from these guys, don't you?Never mind, the big problems were in the basic plot, if that's what you want to call it, and with the characters involved.  The mean Homeland Security guy, that didn't work at all.  Why did he step out of character and buy the ""goat"" thing?  And what was with the sudden heart warming at the end?  There was nothing to set it up.And, to get to the heart of it, the love story.  What on earth was going there?  This women apparently falls in love, leads him on and then, surprise!, she's married (or something) to this real handsome guy.  Okay, well, what was the point then?  I could think of ten different love interest stories that would have worked better, maybe something like she just couldn't follow him back to Whateverstan, I don't know, anything but this.  And what was with the stupid fountain?  He didn't test it?  They ran out of time to shoot it working?  How does that make any sense?Dull and overlong, a waste of money, time and talent.

623944,A3IM5IGE0JCLHO,B00005JMYC,"One World ""One World""","[0, 3]","Ok, I just watched this DVD and I thought I would boot up the ol' computer to get online and review it while it is still hot on my mind.  In some ways this movie made me angry.  Why? Because of it's all too true testimony about how humanity has become like machinery, like circuitry and given to carrying on  robotically (if that's not a word, it is for now!).  Gee wiz someone's country gets into a war that makes it so he cannot go back and he is also prevented from entering into the USA.  Surely computers run on a rigid to the letter protocol but they cannot think and reason.  They do not know how to, they just do what they are told, nothing more...nothing less.  Humans, on the other hand are not computers and can think and reason but yet it appears we choose not to and therefore, we have so much become like them.  It is all about protocol, it is all about policy, it is all about rules.  There is no room for thinking, there is not room for reason.  This movie hits it on the head and boy does it hit a nerve. Ouch!As other reviewers have said, this movie does have charm and warmth.  While the ""powers that be"" are stuck in their protocol, the workers at the airport begin to help out the man without a country.  Then there is the dippy stewardess who is too busy hating men to see her own problems that cause here to hate men.  Hello! Mrs Dippy is 'farin' with a married man who is down-lowin'.  That is a dead-end.  The man she is waiting her whole life for should not be a married one!  She could not see a good thing if he kissed her!  She annoyed me!  Oh and by the way, she accuses the airport resident of not telling her he was living there - oh yes he did but she did not believe he meant it literally but as a figure of speech alluding to being a frequent flier and lenghty airport delays.The movie sports some evil twists with the airport manager has his own vested interests in getting rid of the man without a country.  First he tries to get him to break the law and leave the airport by unsecuring the front doors.  Then trying to convince the man he is afraid to return to his home country.  These ploys don't work.  I am at a loss of what the villianous airport manager meant when he said something like ""when you go to war with America you go to war with me"" maybe that is not the exact verbatum but it did not make much sense.  I really would have loved to see this character get his just deserts but then he was the one we all loved to hate.  As to this villianous character, there did not really seem to be a reason to have so much malice toward the man without a country.  It was not like he was going to get fired over it - least that was not what the storyline was depicting.  It was not as though he had anything to lose or that the MWAC was going to expose some underground drug dealing operation that the airport manager was in on!Finally this movie seems to paint America as ""All that"" like we are so special to be envied.  I resent this.  Yes we have some freedoms that other countries don't enjoy but perhaps too much freedom causes problems that would not otherwise exist.  We live in a country where every one is an island, where it's all about ""my space"", ""what I want"", ""me first and to heck with everyone else"".  In all of our freedom, we enslave ourselves to selfishness, ego, and pride, in our freedom, we are not happy unless we hold others down.In the end things work out, but at what cost?And, ok so the trapped traveler finally gets to achieve his objective and now he wants to ""go home"".

Shrivastava ""pranay""","[1, 5]","Tom Hanks seems to be in a habit of getting himself lost ... the first time it was on a deserted Island in the film Castaway and now he manages to strand himself on an airport terminal. This is not necessarily a bad thing though because nobody can play ""I'm lost"" better than Hanks ... especially after these two performances. Viktor Navorski a native of Krakhozia is on his way to New York and on reaching there news of civil war in krakhozia renders his passport invalid as his country's republic status has been revoked by the UN. From the moment he is conveyed the fact that he cannot leave this airport until his country is officially re-recognised by the UN and all air-travel to Krakhozia resumes, he must wait. And alongwith him the audience waits... waits to discover how this unexpected turn-of-events changes his life. His passport is impounded and all he has with him is the suitcase he carries around and the clothes on his back since his country's currency is also unusable at money-changers. In the beginning adjusting to life in the terminal is harrowing what with the whole place being designed for people on the move. With no place to sleep he improvises by detaching the seats in the lounge and arranging them in line using them as a makeshift couch. He shaves and bathes in the toilet and eats the free crackers and mustard left behind by customers at various fast food outlets. We also discover how Mr. Viktor Naworski touches people's lives by random and sometimes unintentional acts and words of kindness. His absolute humility and native simplicity win him a lot of friends along the way. It also earns him a foe in the form of an ambitious bureaucrat (Stanley Tucci) gunning for the top-job who wants his airport spick-and-span and free from any problems or controversies. For the rest of the story you have to sit back and watch this film as it charms you right to the end. DVD Features : This DVD has no features ... indeed very disappointing. This is a bad trend... why should the consumer buy the DVD if there are no features to enjoy/revisit alongwith the film.

And what a masterful role he plays as a Russian visitor to America...caught up in the Homeland Security web following 9/11.

Steven Spielberg is a great director. I'm sorry to say, this time this great team failed making a great movie.  First of all, it's unnecessary to make Tom Hanks speak with a false foreign accent(it's painful to hear his accent). Second, it's unnecessary to make up a romance between Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones. There is no chemistry between them. His biggest problem is to deal with his invalid citizenship, not a love life. Everybody would be paniced when trapped in an airport terminal without a country. The movie should deal more about how he survived, how he finally gave up struggling, accepting his fate and settling down in his new home. But it seems we don't see much of these.

Gorham ""RCG2""","[6, 6]","Hanks proves genious again in his 3rd movie in 7 years (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Catch Me If You Can"") with director Steven Spielberg. Based loosely on a true story about an out-of-country traveler stuck at an airport because of a revolution back in his home country - this rendering the traveler ""countryless"". The real story took place in France (with an Iranian immigrant), but Spielberg brought this version to the USA, namely New York's ""JFK"" Airport (with Hanks' character from the fictional country of Krakozhia). Hanks, as Viktor Navorski, total transforms himself into the homeless man now living at Terminal 67. The set design is wonderful - and not once did I believe that I was not at JFK Airport. Yes, JFK Airport is used in the movie in the wide shots, but the up close material is not the airport. I read the set design was extensive - built in an old hangar with name brand restaurants and stores. Only thing missing in this movie was some outdoor scenery (you got only a glimpse of the outdoors at the very end of the movie - Viktor's exit from JFK in the snow, and then a quick cab ride down Broadway). Hanks acting (Bulgarian accent et all) was incredible - and outside of ""Ladykillers"" (also from 2004), he hasn't made a bad movie in decades. I truly believe he is one of Hollywood's top 2-3 male actors in the business today. Catherine Zeta-Jones (as mixed-up flight attendent Amelia) was very good as a co-star. Though I must admit, I would've been disappointed if Amelia and Viktor ended up together (Amelia didn't deserve Viktor at all). Bald man Stanley Tucci (""Imposters"", ""The Core"", ""Consiracy"", ""Kiss Of Death"") was great as the heartless Airport commissioner, Frank Dixon. When I saw the trailer in the movie theater I was not inspired to see ""The Terminal"" at all. Even though it was Tom Hanks, it just didn't strike me as a good subject for a movie. I went into this movie expecting nothing and I was totally amazed by the story and the acting. Only bad thing I can mention about ""The Terminal"" DVD is that there are absolutely NO extras.

So all the cool tones are evident until Viktor starts to settle into his new home... He is going to be stuck in New York's JFK airport for an unspecified amount of time... From this moment we see Viktor stuck, trapped, unable to enter United States and that's the fun of this film...Tom Hanks is really so calm, so likable, so emotional, so funny and so real in what he does... Here, he's a very dignified person who is extremely trusting and always full of positive hope... You couldn't insult him if you try... It's very hard to hurt his feelings... He finds the bright side of every angle problem he faces and finds a way for him to live with the situation... He has the virtue of patience, and the testament to hard work, perseverance, and humility... He loves people, and he experiences the culture in an odd way...Hanks plays a Krakozhian capable gentleman whose name is Viktor Navorski who finds himself without a passport and a visa once both are taken from him by the powers-that-be at the terminal, because his visa no longer counts, since his country is no longer in existence, and his passport is no longer valid...Catherine Zeta-Jones brings vulnerability and insecurity to her unhappy character... She plays the gorgeous flight attendant Amalia Warren, a very sensible woman who's always looking for love, trying to find the person that will be her prince... She really wears her emotions on her sleeve and is lonely... She wants some strong relationship in her life... Viktor and Amelia have oceans of things in common and it ends up playing itself out and that's a nice thing to play...The story leaves a lot for reflection, and in some ways, Viktor's stillness allows him to be a mirror for the people working in the airport to meditate on their own lives...""The Terminal"" is a charming film...

623957,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JMYC,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 6]","**1/2Viktor Navorski is a man without a country - literally.  On the very day his plane touches down at JFK, Viktor learns that a coup has occurred back in his fictional home country of Krakozha.  Among other inconveniences, this international crisis renders his passport invalid until the United States government agrees to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with the destabilized country's new leadership.  Until then, Viktor remains a virtual prisoner in the terminal, unable to leave the premises and forced to live under the watchful eye of airport security.  There's a certain irony in the fact that Viktor, who was presumably raised in a draconian communist country, becomes the ultimate victim of a de-humanized bureaucracy and a mountain of red tape the minute he sets foot on American soil.  From that moment on, he has to find a way to survive in this strange new environment, but eventually he learns to make the airport his home, winning friends and wooing a love interest (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) into the bargain.Certainly, there are those who will find this fable about a simple man, trapped somewhere between the worlds of Capra and Kafka, heartwarming and charming.  All I can say is that I found it, for the most part, aggravatingly contrived and cutesy, too infatuated with its own premise to develop a sustainable storyline.  The problem begins with Tom Hanks who has milked the Average Joe/ Mr. Nice Guy shtick so much throughout his long career that it has long since lost any impact it once might have had.  Adding a cutesy Eastern European accent to the brew just makes the performance all that more insufferable.  In essence, Victor is reduced to little more than a ""man/child,"" hardly a character worth developing a full length, tour de force feature film around.Steven Spielberg, who normally can do no wrong as a director, for some reason is unable to make an effective go of things here.  Could it be because Spielberg handles sentiment well when he's working in a generally unsentimental genre like science fiction where he has some built-in tension to work off of, but that when he's dabbling in a highly sentimental genre like romantic comedy, he runs out of energy and vision?  He's done a terrific job recreating an entire functioning airport terminal on a soundstage, but none of that really matters very much when we begin feeling as trapped inside the setting as Viktor himself does.  Throughout the whole movie, I just kept wishing Viktor would bust his way through the terminal doors and find his way into a more interesting story.  Almost all the secondary characters are shallow, stereotypical and uninteresting, while Stanley Tucci's nasty little airport manager is not only annoying and repulsive but completely incomprehensible from a psychological point of view.""The Terminal"" is one of those movies that is so impressed with its own sweetness and goodness that it winds up patronizing all the ""little people"" it thinks it's celebrating.

623958,AOL6BG6SAFGQF,B00005JMYC,Rufus Quail,"[4, 5]","Unil I saw The Terminal, I was not a fan of Tom Hanks.  I thought of him as a McActor, the Jimmy Stewart or Gary Cooper of his generation.  A competent but not compelling actor.  That changed when I saw Hanks's Viktor Navorski.  Hanks anchors and drives this delightful movie with a masterly performance.Viktor, a tourist from Eastern Europe, has just landed at JFK and is being processed through customs.  He doesn't speak English.  A quirk in customs regulations causes Viktor to be confined overnight at the airport.  Bureaucratic bungling turns Viktor's confinement into an extended stay.  Viktor's bureaucratic tormenter is the heartless and mean-spirited Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection, played to snarling perfection by Stanley Tucci.A memorable scene is when Viktor presents Dixon with a taxidermed Virgin Isle swordfish to add to the collection of fishing trophies proudly displayed on the walls of his office.  The fish is almost as big as Viktor.  Not only does the peevish official viciously reject the gift, he promises Viktor ""You will not set one foot in New York City.  Not a single toe in the United States of America.  Do you understand what I am saying to you?""You see the anger welling up in Viktor.  He is about to explode with rage, about to flatten the bully with a well-deserved roundhouse right, or at least curse him out.  Then he summons his better instincts.  ""Yes.  You don't like fish,"" he says and walks out.  Viktor is too decent a man to stoop to Dixon's level. The scene finishes with a light dollop of comedy as Viktor clumsily drags the outsized fish out the door.Of course people like Viktor don't really exist.  The movie is pure fantasy about a world as we wish it could be.  It is full of brotherhood and camaraderie among airport employees.  We all know that in the real world, the workplace is full of backstabbing, one-upmanship, and cutthroat competition.This airport is a joyous place to work whereas a real one is peopled with workers struggling to cope with crushing drudgery.  The workers at this airport are good-hearted, loveable characters and pretty women like Zoe Saldana, who plays Torres, the comely bureaucrat who dutifully stamps ""DENIED"" on Viktor's daily application to be released from his terminal purgatory.So what's wrong with a little fantasy?  If you can buy into it, The Terminal is rewarding movie.  You would have to watch at least three other movies to experience all the heartwarming, romantic, and funny touches in The Terminal.The Hollywood blockbuster playbook dictates a bittersweet romance.  The Terminal's version pairs Viktor with Amelia, the bookish flight attendent played by Catherine Zeta Jones.  The movie would have been just as entertaining without this artless contrivance.  Jones's screen allure compensates for the trying moments.A word about the airport set that was created for this movie.  When I saw the film, I thought ""Wow.  I didn't know they had such nice airports in New York.""  Then I found out it's not a real airport but a set.  Like the workers, the airport is yet another charming character in the movie.Speaking of villians, fans of the TV show House will recall Edward Vogler, the angry executive determined to destroy House.

623960,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JMYC,Samuel McKewon,"[1, 4]","For all Steven Spielberg's directorial gifts, brevity is not one of them. The worst film he has made since ""1941"" 25 years ago, ""The Terminal"" is aptly named - a 90-minute concept stretched a full hour beyond its expiration date, with only a accent-bearing, shambling Tom Hanks to accompany us.Spielberg's film fails on more than one level, but mostly because he saddles the central plot - a man forced to live in the international terminal of New York's JFK Airport - with a collection of either forgotten or underdeveloped side stories that pay lip service to diversity - a Latino, a black guy, a black girl, an Indian janior, a beautiful stewardess - without making much of use of them until the last half-hour, when these cardboard cutouts suddenly claim a stake in the game.You think ""Return of the King"" had too many endings? Just wait. And wait.Hanks is Viktor Navorski, a native of the fictional Krakovia, where rebels have overthrown the government. Viktor is in New York on a trip whose motiviation remains unspecified until very late in the film. With his country in the throes of a coup, his passport and visa are no longer valid. Homeland Security agent Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) tells Viktor bluntly with a bag of chips smashed by an apple: Viktor can't go home, and he can't go to New York. He's shown the terminal, and the doors to New York through which he cannot pass.What follows is a mix of Frank Capra fable and a human jungle version of Hanks' ""Cast Away."" Viktor builds a makeshift bed out of torn seats at an abandoned gate; he finds quarters to buy Burger King cheeseburgers (at a cheaper cost than you'd ever find in an airport); he makes friends with a baggage handler (Chi McBride), the janitor (Kumar Pallanatucci) and a food service worker (Diego Luna) smitten with an INS agent (Zoe Saldana); and he flirts with the Midwestern stewardness (a perky Catherine Zeta-Jones), a psuedo-intellectual who is the mistress of a wealthy, married man.Viktor also turns down Dixon's offers to help him into New York, where he can become, Dixon thinks, ""someone else's problem."" Viktor won't leave on his own. He refuses asylum. Dixon won't detain Viktor until he's broken some law, although, I would think, taking payments under the table to do construction work in the airport is reasonably illegal.The movie's turning point occurs when a Russian man threatens to kill himself unless he's allowed to deliver Canadian medicine to his dying father; Dixon calls in Viktor to translate, and Viktor's solution, clever as it may be, is so prepostorous that it  takes ""The Terminal"" off whatever rail its was still hugging and straight into foolishness: A marriage proposal, an elaborate, mosaic fountain built out of ceramic scraps, a cruel blackmail by Dixon and, yes, a jumbo jet brought to a halt by a wet mop.Despite his two Oscars, Hanks is more gifted than critics give him credit for, and his subtle comic work as Viktor works much better than his recent turn in ""The Ladykillers."" Tucci, until his character is forced to become vengeful, embodies a decent-yet-prideful Dixon. If there is a couple in this film, it's these two. Hanks and Zeta-Jones have zero chemistry - their kiss is in long shot, with the camera pulling away - and the downbeat end note on their relationship provides the lone beacon of reality in ""The Terminal."" The set design by Alex McDowell is quite flawless - this might as well be a working airport - and yet Spielberg never does much with it. He so immerses himself in these subplots that the airport becomes a stale gimmick.But, more frustrating, is a screenplay, by Jeff Nathanson and Sacha Gervasi, that actually conspires to keep Viktor - and us - waiting longer than he needs to be. ""Everybody has a story,"" Dixon says at one point, and if Viktor were allowed to explain his reason for being in New York to anyone but a stewardess who doesn't even know Viktor lives in the airport, it's quite likely that something could have been ""arranged.""Would ""The Terminal"" have the been the same movie? No. It would have been a better one.",2,"Terminal, indeed.",1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,4083,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'directorial', 'gifts', 'brevity', 'not', 'one', 'worst', 'film', 'made', '1941', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'Terminal', 'aptly', 'named', '90-minute', 'concept', 'stretched', 'full', 'hour', 'expiration', 'date', 'only', 'accent-bearing', 'shambling', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'accompany', 'us.Spielberg', 'film', 'more', 'one', 'level', 'mostly', 'central', 'plot', 'man', 'forced', 'live', 'international', 'terminal', 'New', 'York', 'JFK', 'Airport', 'collection', 'forgotten', 'underdeveloped', 'side', 'stories', 'pay', 'lip', 'service', 'diversity', 'Latino', 'black', 'guy', 'black', 'girl', 'Indian', 'janior', 'beautiful', 'stewardess', 'making', 'much', 'use', 'last', 'half-hour', 'when', 'cardboard', 'suddenly', 'claim', 'stake', 'game.You', 'think', 'Return', 'King', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'endings', 'Just', 'wait', 'wait.Hanks', 'Viktor', 'Navorski', 'native', 'fictional', 'Krakovia', 'where', 'rebels', 'have', 'overthrown', 'government', 'Viktor', 'New', 'York', 'trip', 'motiviation', 'unspecified', 'very', 'late', 'film', 'country', 'throes', 'coup', 'passport', 'visa', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'valid', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'agent', 'Frank', 'Dixon', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Viktor', 'bluntly', 'bag', 'chips', 'smashed', 'apple', 'Viktor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'home', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'New', 'York', 'shown', 'terminal', 'doors', 'New', 'York', 'can', 'not', 'pass.What', 'mix', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'fable', 'human', 'jungle', 'version', 'Hanks', 'Cast', 'Away', 'Viktor', 'makeshift', 'bed', 'torn', 'seats', 'abandoned', 'gate', 'quarters', 'buy', 'Burger', 'King', 'cheeseburgers', 'cheaper', 'cost', ""'d"", 'ever', 'find', 'airport', 'friends', 'baggage', 'handler', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'janitor', 'Kumar', 'Pallanatucci', 'food', 'service', 'worker', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'smitten', 'INS', 'agent', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Midwestern', 'stewardness', 'perky', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'psuedo-intellectual', 'who', 'mistress', 'wealthy', 'married', 'man.Viktor', 'also', 'down', 'Dixon', 'offers', 'help', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'can', 'become', 'Dixon', 'someone', 'else', 'problem', 'Viktor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'own', 'asylum', 'Dixon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'detain', 'Viktor', 'law', 'would', 'think', 'taking', 'payments', 'table', 'do', 'construction', 'work', 'airport', 'reasonably', 'illegal.The', 'movie', 'turning', 'point', 'when', 'Russian', 'man', 'kill', 'allowed', 'deliver', 'Canadian', 'medicine', 'dying', 'father', 'Dixon', 'Viktor', 'translate', 'Viktor', 'solution', 'clever', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'prepostorous', 'Terminal', 'off', 'rail', 'was', 'still', 'hugging', 'straight', 'foolishness', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'elaborate', 'mosaic', 'fountain', 'built', 'ceramic', 'scraps', 'cruel', 'blackmail', 'Dixon', 'yes', 'jumbo', 'jet', 'brought', 'halt', 'wet', 'mop.Despite', 'two', 'Oscars', 'Hanks', 'more', 'gifted', 'critics', 'give', 'credit', 'subtle', 'comic', 'work', 'Viktor', 'much', 'better', 'recent', 'turn', 'Ladykillers', 'Tucci', 'character', 'forced', 'become', 'vengeful', 'decent-yet-prideful', 'Dixon', 'couple', 'film', 'two', 'Hanks', 'Zeta-Jones', 'have', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'kiss', 'long', 'shot', 'camera', 'pulling', 'away', 'downbeat', 'end', 'note', 'relationship', 'lone', 'beacon', 'reality', 'Terminal', 'set', 'design', 'Alex', 'McDowell', 'quite', 'flawless', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'working', 'airport', 'yet', 'Spielberg', 'never', 'much', 'so', 'subplots', 'airport', 'stale', 'gimmick.But', 'more', 'frustrating', 'screenplay', 'Jeff', 'Nathanson', 'Sacha', 'Gervasi', 'actually', 'keep', 'Viktor', 'waiting', 'longer', 'be', 'Everybody', 'story', 'Dixon', 'one', 'point', 'Viktor', 'were', 'allowed', 'explain', 'reason', 'being', 'New', 'York', 'anyone', 'stewardess', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Viktor', 'airport', 'quite', 'likely', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'arranged', 'Would', 'Terminal', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'movie', 'No', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'one']",N/A

623962,AQM2ADBR0TYSO,B00005JMYC,Sarah Schenkkan,"[2, 3]","In Steven Spielberg's ""The Terminal"", Tom Hanks stars as Viktor Navorski, who comes to New York City from his home country of Krakohzia, unfortunately, just as the government is overthrown in a military coup. Now, as his country is now ""no longer recognized"" by the United Nations, his tickets and passport are invalid, and he is stranded between America and Krakohzia; within the terminal at JFK airport. Speaking little English and without American money, Viktor's temporary stay turns into 9 months where he creates a home for himself, befriending airport employees (Chi McBride, Diego Luna, Kumar Pullana) and annoying Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), a security executive who feels Viktor is a threat to his strive for a promotion. Viktor also falls in love with flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who always seems to be with the wrong man.Lately, after creating films to challenge our perception of reality and of the future, ""The Terminal"" is a nice change for Spielberg, who seems to return to the similar genre every so often. It's not exactly hard-hitting, but it's entertaining, and a whimsical idea for a film that is executed well, even more so with a brilliant Hanks attached to the role of Viktor Navorksi. In a difficult to understand accent, and a sort of confused yet resourceful and humorous manner, the audience is immediately taken up with him. He plays to the compassionate side of the audience, and we can't help but to ooze sympathy and root for him throughout the film. He is, in a sense, the perfect leading man. As a supporting cast, Tucci is fantastic as Frank Dixon, and Diego Luna is perfect as a lovesick airline worker. However, the real nod goes to Kumar Pallana, whose oddball and paranoid Indian janitor of a character supplies a large portion of humor in the film.Aside from the performances, the set of the terminal itself is nothing short of brillance, although it's certainly not like any airport I've ever been to. With an electrical ticket board, level upon level, and throngs of product placements, it is a massive, yet extremely realistic visual setting, that personifies the chaos of airports and traveling, and also provides a splendid backdrop for the film.While it is a good film with some solid performances and big laughs, there are many things in ""The Terminal"" that don't exactly work. Thanks to holes in the script, and plotlines that end up falling apart (for example, the romance between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Tom Hanks) the problems with the movie are hard to miss. While attention to detail in other areas is immaculate, the script has obvious flaws that no one seemed to catch, and some plot choices stretch our concept of what could actually happen. However, the film is funny, clever, and certainly original, and for that, it makes for an enjoyable day at the movies, despite its flaws.",4,"Spend A Layover In This ""Terminal""...Despite Its Flaws",1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,2864,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Terminal', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Viktor', 'Navorski', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'home', 'country', 'Krakohzia', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'government', 'overthrown', 'military', 'coup', 'Now', 'country', 'now', 'no', 'longer', 'recognized', 'United', 'Nations', 'tickets', 'passport', 'are', 'invalid', 'stranded', 'America', 'Krakohzia', 'terminal', 'JFK', 'airport', 'Speaking', 'little', 'English', 'American', 'money', 'Viktor', 'temporary', 'stay', '9', 'months', 'where', 'home', 'befriending', 'airport', 'employees', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'Kumar', 'Pullana', 'annoying', 'Frank', 'Dixon', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'security', 'executive', 'who', 'Viktor', 'threat', 'strive', 'promotion', 'Viktor', 'also', 'love', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Amelia', 'Warren', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'wrong', 'man.Lately', 'creating', 'films', 'challenge', 'perception', 'reality', 'future', 'Terminal', 'nice', 'change', 'Spielberg', 'who', 'return', 'similar', 'genre', 'so', 'often', 'not', 'exactly', 'hard-hitting', 'entertaining', 'whimsical', 'idea', 'film', 'executed', 'well', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'brilliant', 'Hanks', 'attached', 'role', 'Viktor', 'Navorksi', 'difficult', 'understand', 'accent', 'sort', 'confused', 'yet', 'resourceful', 'humorous', 'manner', 'audience', 'immediately', 'taken', 'up', 'compassionate', 'side', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'ooze', 'sympathy', 'root', 'film', 'sense', 'perfect', 'leading', 'man', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Tucci', 'fantastic', 'Frank', 'Dixon', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'perfect', 'lovesick', 'airline', 'worker', 'However', 'real', 'nod', 'Kumar', 'Pallana', 'oddball', 'paranoid', 'Indian', 'janitor', 'character', 'large', 'portion', 'humor', 'film.Aside', 'performances', 'set', 'terminal', 'nothing', 'short', 'brillance', 'certainly', 'not', 'airport', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'electrical', 'ticket', 'board', 'level', 'level', 'throngs', 'product', 'placements', 'massive', 'yet', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'visual', 'setting', 'chaos', 'airports', 'traveling', 'also', 'splendid', 'backdrop', 'film.While', 'good', 'film', 'solid', 'performances', 'big', 'laughs', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'Terminal', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'work', 'Thanks', 'holes', 'script', 'plotlines', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'apart', 'example', 'romance', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'problems', 'movie', 'are', 'hard', 'miss', 'attention', 'detail', 'other', 'areas', 'immaculate', 'script', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'one', 'seemed', 'catch', 'plot', 'choices', 'stretch', 'concept', 'what', 'could', 'actually', 'happen', 'However', 'film', 'funny', 'clever', 'certainly', 'original', 'enjoyable', 'day', 'movies', 'flaws']",N/A

Cast as undesireable, he is forced to live in the International Terminal Lounge of the airport where he lives for 9 months by working, first for quarters, then under -the-table for the contractors that are forever rebuilding JFK (a side-note - they've been ""repairing"" JFK for over 20 years and it still isn't finished!).  During that time, he teaches himself English and makes friends with all the regular people that work in the airport.Catherine Zeta-Jones' character could have easily been played by any number of over 30 actresses. Far more loveable are Hanks' character's three close friends that he makes at the airport - an elderly Indian (Asia) janitor, a young Hispanic food preparation worker, and a black family man that works in engineering (I think).The movie is clean - no language, no sex, no violence - making it a great movie for the family.",4,Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg do it again,1105833600,"01 16, 2005",2005,1202,"['had', 'heard', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'course', 'terms', 'movies', 'generally', 'subjective', 'term', 'However', 'Terminal', 'light', 'what', 'impossible', 'situation.Well', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'movie', 'telling', 'tale', 'Eastern', 'European', 'man', 'who', 'JFK', 'find', 'no', 'longer', 'homeland', 'Cast', 'undesireable', 'forced', 'live', 'International', 'Terminal', 'Lounge', 'airport', 'where', '9', 'months', 'working', 'first', 'quarters', 'then', '-the-table', 'contractors', 'are', 'forever', 'rebuilding', 'JFK', 'side-note', ""'ve"", 'been', 'repairing', 'JFK', '20', 'years', 'still', ""n't"", 'finished', 'time', 'English', 'friends', 'regular', 'people', 'work', 'airport.Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'played', 'number', '30', 'actresses', 'Far', 'more', 'loveable', 'are', 'Hanks', 'character', 'three', 'close', 'friends', 'airport', 'elderly', 'Indian', 'Asia', 'janitor', 'young', 'Hispanic', 'food', 'preparation', 'worker', 'black', 'family', 'man', 'engineering', 'think', '.The', 'movie', 'clean', 'language', 'sex', 'violence', 'making', 'great', 'movie', 'family']",N/A
623964,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JMYC,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 3]","Steven Spielberg may have been tired.  Tom Hanks may have been fatigued.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was available.  What else can explain the choices that led to ""The Terminal""?  Spielberg and Hanks can make feel-good movies in their sleep, and they generally hit all the right notes in this light-hearted flick.""The Terminal"" stars Hanks as Victor Navorsky, who arrives at JFK airport from a minor Eastern European country (""Krakozia"") literally hours after Krakozia's government falls in a coup.  Victor's passport is now useless, and he is stuck in the international ""lounge"" (ha-ha) until the situation can be resolved.Hanks plays Victor with the earnest, lovable sincerity that only he can bring.  Victor is smart -- he teaches himself functional English by buying an English travel book and one written in his native tongue.  And he finds several different ways to earn some cash -- some believable, others not so much.  But you never really mind the bits of implausibility in Victor's tale, 'cause it's Tom Hanks.  And you can't but help love Tom Hanks.Victor has the misfortune of arriving in the airport just as Dixon (Stanley Tucci) takes over its administration.  Just as Hanks can make you fall in love with him with a glance, Tucci is one of those actors who can effortlessly evoke all the negative tones from a mid-level bureaucrat -- oily, pompous, hypocritical, and above all, just a wee bit nasty.  After about two seconds of screen time, you know that Dixon is one of those guys who enjoys telling you that the form you have waited in line all day to submit is, in fact, sorry to say, improperly filled out, and won't you please go to the back of the line after you've properly completed it?  Definitely not an evil man, but surely trumped up with his minor powers, Dixon is a perfect foil for Victor.Eventually Dixon gets tired of Victor hanging around and messing with ""his airport,"" so he tries to get Victor to break any number of minor laws so that ""he'll be someone else's problem.""  But Victor, perhaps because he's familiar with this caprice from government officials back home, is too smart and refuses to break the law.  Which is impressive restraint, considering how stultifying and uncomfortable an airport environment is (a fact that the movie captures with several small, perfect scenes).As the days trundle by, Victor meets several other full-time workers at the terminal, and they all more or less fall under the spell of this charming Krakozian.  Of course, this being a Spielberg comedy, virtually all of these supporting characters are charming in their own way, and there are several genuinely heartfelt moments involving Victor's friends.There are only two low points in this movie, and I've already alluded to one.  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a flight attendant struggling with middle age and her affair with a married man.  She meets Victor and like us can't help but falling for his adorable honesty and intelligence.  The problem isn't the character -- it's casting this actress.  Zeta-Jones is a talented actress (see ""Chicago,"" ""High Fidelity,"" ""America's Sweethearts,"" and ""Traffic""), but her strengths lie in playing, shall we say, less-than-admirable women.  Here, the part calls for a level of sweetness that Zeta-Jones just doesn't have, and it looks slightly ridiculous to watch her try.The other problem I have with ""The Terminal"" is the rampant product placement.  Tom Hanks has made some wonderful movies, but some of them start to creak under the sheer audacity of the various plugs and promos in the movie.  Anyone else recall the ""Visa"" and ""Starbucks"" scenes from ""You've Got Mail""?  How about the none-too-subtle FedEx plugs in ""Castaway""?  I'm not sure what Borders paid Spielberg to have its role in this movie, but I would hope that after all the billions Spielberg has made over the years, he could refrain from this kind of selling out.  I half expected to see ""Borders"" in the closing credits under ""Bookstore In Terminal.""Still, all in all, ""The Terminal"" is an enjoyable film appropriate for virtually all audiences.  There's an enjoyable maguffin involving Victor's can of peanuts, and several moments where you just want to reach out and hug Victor and his friends.

623967,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00005JMYC,Sebastian Fernandez,"[1, 1]","This comedy focuses on some of the flaws in the immigration system in the US and exposes how sometimes strict rules have to be bent for things to make sense. Everything starts when Viktor Navorski arrives to the US and is stopped at immigration on the JFK airport because his passport is invalid. That is where the nonsense begins, since even though he speaks no English, the personnel of Homeland Security talk to him really slow as if that would change his understanding of a language with which he is unfamiliar. Things just escalate from there.Viktor's country (Krakozia) has suspended his right of traveling with his passport due a political war at home that has the country in total chaos; basically there is no country. The problem is that he cannot enter the US, but he cannot return home either, so he is stranded in the airport. The solution: he has to remain in the International Transit Lounge while his situation is sorted out.Little by little we see this individual figuring out how to survive in this strange world, filling us with a sense of desperation due to his situation, but at the same time with one of hope due to his ability to cope and figure things out. Hanks is excellent in transmitting the emotions of this character, and his portrayal of a foreign citizen with an accent resembling Bulgarian is praiseworthy.The film revolves around Viktor's problem and his relationship with several people in the airport. First there is Frank (Tucci), the acting Field Commissioner of Homeland Security, who wants to get rid of Viktor in order to have less to worry about when the time comes for the inspection that will determine if he gets the position for good. Then there is Amelia Warren (Zeta-Jones), who is a stewardess that is having an affair with a married man, and who Viktor falls for at first sight. Finally, there is the relationship with other employees at the airport, which allows us to see the values of this man and how these values and convictions affect the lives of those that surround him and learn to love him.If you have ever been in the situation of having to go through security as a foreigner in a US airport (even with al the proper documentation), you will understand how the main character feels. But even if you have not experienced this before, I believe you will appreciate this film's qualities, which have to do with doing everything you can to survive and achieve your goals, using the power of friendship to surmount any obstacles and realizing that sometimes bending the rules is the right course of action.Besides the performance by Tom Hanks, this movie counts with a Stanley Tucci at the top of his game. This actor is so successful in playing annoyed guys with a miserable life that it is uncanny. Zeta-Jones provides a visual enjoyment with her beauty and an OK portrayal of Amelia, which only is sub par in the scenes that involve high emotional levels, since in my opinion she exaggerates the emotions in these cases. The final result is a nice film that will make you think and laugh, and hopefully entertain you for a little while too. - 3.5 stars.",3,"""What is the purpose of your visit?""",1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,3111,"['comedy', 'flaws', 'immigration', 'system', 'US', 'how', 'sometimes', 'strict', 'rules', 'have', 'be', 'bent', 'things', 'make', 'sense', 'Everything', 'when', 'Viktor', 'Navorski', 'US', 'stopped', 'immigration', 'JFK', 'airport', 'passport', 'invalid', 'where', 'nonsense', 'even', 'English', 'personnel', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'talk', 'really', 'slow', 'would', 'change', 'understanding', 'language', 'unfamiliar', 'Things', 'just', 'escalate', 'there.Viktor', 'country', 'Krakozia', 'suspended', 'right', 'traveling', 'passport', 'due', 'political', 'war', 'home', 'country', 'total', 'chaos', 'basically', 'country', 'problem', 'can', 'not', 'enter', 'US', 'can', 'not', 'return', 'home', 'stranded', 'airport', 'solution', 'remain', 'International', 'Transit', 'Lounge', 'situation', 'sorted', 'out.Little', 'little', 'see', 'individual', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'survive', 'strange', 'world', 'filling', 'sense', 'desperation', 'due', 'situation', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'hope', 'due', 'ability', 'cope', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'Hanks', 'excellent', 'transmitting', 'emotions', 'character', 'portrayal', 'foreign', 'citizen', 'accent', 'resembling', 'Bulgarian', 'praiseworthy.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'Viktor', 'problem', 'relationship', 'several', 'people', 'airport', 'First', 'Frank', 'Tucci', 'acting', 'Field', 'Commissioner', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'who', 'get', 'rid', 'Viktor', 'order', 'have', 'less', 'worry', 'when', 'time', 'inspection', 'will', 'determine', 'position', 'good', 'Then', 'Amelia', 'Warren', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'stewardess', 'having', 'affair', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'Viktor', 'first', 'sight', 'Finally', 'relationship', 'other', 'employees', 'airport', 'see', 'values', 'man', 'how', 'values', 'convictions', 'affect', 'lives', 'surround', 'learn', 'love', 'him.If', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'situation', 'having', 'go', 'through', 'security', 'foreigner', 'US', 'airport', 'even', 'proper', 'documentation', 'will', 'understand', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'feels', 'even', 'have', 'not', 'experienced', 'believe', 'will', 'appreciate', 'film', 'qualities', 'have', 'do', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'survive', 'achieve', 'goals', 'using', 'power', 'friendship', 'surmount', 'obstacles', 'realizing', 'sometimes', 'bending', 'rules', 'right', 'course', 'action.Besides', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movie', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'top', 'game', 'actor', 'so', 'successful', 'playing', 'annoyed', 'guys', 'miserable', 'life', 'uncanny', 'Zeta-Jones', 'visual', 'enjoyment', 'beauty', 'OK', 'portrayal', 'Amelia', 'only', 'sub', 'par', 'scenes', 'involve', 'high', 'emotional', 'levels', 'opinion', 'emotions', 'cases', 'final', 'result', 'nice', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'laugh', 'hopefully', 'entertain', 'little', 'too', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A

For instance, the first problem he runs into is finding food without American money (his currency is worthless now that his country is no longer recognized) which leads him to improvise with give-away crackers, mustard, and ketchup. This meager meal seems to be a social commentary on America's wastefulness.There are various subplots with colorful characters that also keep it moving, all of which are somewhat conveniently from different backgrounds -- Spanish, Indian, Bla...oops, African American.Most notable among these is a romantic affair between Viktor and the flight stewardess Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The courting process is very cute, culminating in a date on the roof of the airport, assisted lovingly by Viktor's friends in the airport staff. That it all ends up in naught doesn't detract from the warmth of the romantic vignettes.Amidst all these peccadilloes of simple beings, the film's political messages are affecting too. Viktor's predicament is due to the newly-created and always-frantic Department of Homeland Security, which puts the airport security director in the position of wanting to wash his hands of Viktor rather than help him. In one particularly insidious moment, he encourages Viktor to leave the airport even though it is illegal, just so that he can be arrested and move to another's jurisdiction. Add to this the airport's bureaucracy, its overloaded customs traffic and a haunting scene involving a traveler desperate for Canadian prescription drugs to save his father, and The Terminal emerges as a political commentary that pulls no punches.The humour is occasionally corny, and Spielberg, as with his last two films, doesn't really know when to end the film. Yet in general it leaves you with an unmistakable smile on your face throughout.Not to be missed!",4,COMICAL POLITICS AND HEARTWARMING MESSAGES AT GATE 67,1097452800,"10 11, 2004",2004,2479,"['premise', 'may', 'face', 'value', 'be', 'just', 'wee', 'bit', 'over-baked', 'clueless', 'foreigner', 'Viktor', 'viable', 'passport', 'stranded', 'JFK', 'airport', 'year', 'reason', 'buy', 'film', 'unusual', 'mix', 'melodrama', 'comedy', 'romance', 'baffled', 'immigrant', 'grounded', 'very', 'realistic', 'interactions.Any', 'non-American', 'who', 'visited', 'US', '2001', 'will', 'readily', 'relate', 'cumbersome', 'immigration', 'processes', 'potentially', 'boring', 'premise', 'film', 'Spielberg', 'Hanks', 'Inc', 'smoosh', 'enough', 'bittersweet', 'slapstick', 'humanity', 'script.Viktor', 'always', 'faced', 'new', 'problems', 'adjusting', 'new', 'life', 'airport', 'instance', 'first', 'problem', 'finding', 'food', 'American', 'money', 'currency', 'worthless', 'now', 'country', 'longer', 'recognized', 'improvise', 'give-away', 'crackers', 'mustard', 'ketchup', 'meager', 'meal', 'be', 'social', 'commentary', 'America', 'are', 'various', 'subplots', 'colorful', 'characters', 'also', 'keep', 'moving', 'are', 'somewhat', 'conveniently', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'Spanish', 'Indian', 'Bla', 'African', 'American.Most', 'notable', 'romantic', 'affair', 'Viktor', 'flight', 'stewardess', 'Amelia', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'courting', 'process', 'very', 'cute', 'culminating', 'date', 'roof', 'airport', 'assisted', 'lovingly', 'Viktor', 'friends', 'airport', 'staff', 'up', 'naught', ""n't"", 'detract', 'warmth', 'romantic', 'vignettes.Amidst', 'peccadilloes', 'simple', 'beings', 'film', 'political', 'messages', 'are', 'affecting', 'too', 'Viktor', 'predicament', 'due', 'newly-created', 'always-frantic', 'Department', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'airport', 'security', 'director', 'position', 'wanting', 'wash', 'hands', 'Viktor', 'rather', 'help', 'one', 'particularly', 'insidious', 'moment', 'Viktor', 'leave', 'airport', 'even', 'illegal', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'arrested', 'move', 'jurisdiction', 'Add', 'airport', 'bureaucracy', 'overloaded', 'customs', 'traffic', 'haunting', 'scene', 'involving', 'traveler', 'desperate', 'Canadian', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'save', 'father', 'Terminal', 'political', 'commentary', 'punches.The', 'humour', 'occasionally', 'corny', 'Spielberg', 'last', 'two', 'films', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'when', 'end', 'film', 'general', 'unmistakable', 'smile', 'face', 'throughout.Not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

His native country of Krakozhia enters into a political situation and he must be held within the terminal until his visa is valid as he cannot be cleared into the US.The music added by John Williams is light and lively.  It lends an almost jingling feel and an upbeat score.  Music selections are carefully placed with the song 'I Love New York' on the TV monitor as the people look on. The orchestrated melodies of 'Strangers in the Night' and 'Moon River', along with many others, give a solid background and underscore everyone that Viktor will encounter and to every experience involved.Viktor wanders around the terminal, eats saltine cracker sandwiches with mustard and ketchup for his meals at first and becomes very adept at making money.  He is always very helpful with the passengers and while meeting a lovely, and questioning her life, flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  They have a budding friendship onward to a dance with romance, while discussing the intriguing relationship between Napoleon and his Josephine.He begins to slowly learn English while reading Broadway's history and relating  to the staff working within.  Becoming a vital part of the staff's life, he is interrelating and becomes endeared by them all.  That is with one exception in Frank (Stanley Tucci) as from the beginning, he has been trying to set Viktor up in plots to catch him, in order to have him expelled from the terminal.Viktor becomes a Jack of all Trades as; a translator, architect, food critic, painter, poker player and world class citizen to solve various dilemmas for himself and to be helpful to all, even Frank (SUCCESS).  Certainly Frank doesn't deserve this from Viktor as he is the villainous type.The attraction and ensuing relationship of Amelia and Viktor is all too human.  We all step up at times to protect and care for one who is vulnerable.  It is what separates us from that which is foreign.  Not our nationality but our own humanity.  They are a smaller picture of this broader theme throughout the movie, therein lies several other small pictures adding into the whole.Full of symbolism and directed with finesse by Steven Spielberg; comes another movie with a heavy look into what makes us all alike, and unique at the same time.

The charming romantic comedy is one of the rare romantic comedies that actually is both romantic AND funny.  The Terminal truly does makes ones emotions come out.  You'll feel joy and sadness all at once as well as being moved by the performances!Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is a man who has come from Krakozia (a fictional country) to fulfill something for his father.  But as he made his way to America a millitary coup breaks out in his country and the government is overthrown.  Therefore, Krakozia is no longer recognized as a country by the rest of the world.  Victor can't go into America because his country is no longer recognized but he can't go back either because he also ""has no country"" and his passport becomes invalid.  So what does he do? He lives in The Terminal.Victor doesn't speak very good English and understand few words.  When he first arrives in the Terminal he's quite the outcast that can't do much for himself.  He's given food vouchers which, as you can imagine, he promptly loses.But overtime Victor gets friends in the Terminal.  He gets to know the Janitor and the one in charge of checking bags as well as a man who is willing to give him food if Victor delivers messages to the girl he likes.It's easy to see where the film begins to flaw.  Some of the things we see Victor do are useless to the film.  It's clear that Victor is doing what we're all doing when waiting for a flight, killing time.Then there's Amelie the stewartess (Catherine-Zeta Jones) and his love interest.  Their first meeting is a short meeting that comes about by accident.  Still, as the movie goes on they grow to like one another and Victor's friends even help him get a date.The movie presents great comedy and joy.  It's a fun-filled movie and the ending isn't what anyone expected from it.The Terminal is a feel good film but its long.

I think the film was lost somewhere in all the feel good moments and overly dramatic cheesiness. The film was loosely based on the true story of a man who was forced to live in the Charles de Gaulle International airport in Paris.The story starts out with Victor Navorsky (Tom Hanks) being denied access onto US soil after landing in NY from Krakozhia (a made up country for the story). Krakozhia essentially does not exist any more as it has fallen into a coup, therefore his passport and visa are rendered useless. The whole story is essentially Victor's day to day struggle to survive in this airport. Basically, the story starts to fall apart as soon as the original plot of him surviving wears off and it starts to delve more into the romantic comedy subplots.Hanks character was actually very well played and interesting to watch. It was intriguing watching him come up with ingenious ideas for making money to feed himself and different ways to make himself comfortable. Then there is the mystery of the can of peanuts throughout the whole movie which you only find out at the very end what its contents are.It's the other characters that draw life from the movie in my opinion. Tucci plays Dixon, the airport security guy who has made it his life mission to make Victor's life a living hell. His character was too one dimensional. He was too much the typical villain.Then there was Catherine Zita-Jones character. She played a flight attendant who was `the other woman' in a love triangle with a married man. Her character was an egotistical, weak minded woman who couldn't seem to break away (or just didn't want to break away) from her destructive situations. Again, her character was very one dimensional and the only reason I could see Hanks character having any interest in her would be completely sexual; which doesn't make for a very good plot for a movie that comes across as a romantic comedy. There needed to be more there; more feeling for their relationship. I felt nothing for the two of them. Also, I don't think Hanks and Zeta-Jones have very good chemistry on screen. Hanks and Meg Ryan have wonderful chemistry for example. Zeta-Jones just didn't cut it.Then there were the subplots of other airport workers that just came off as WAY over the top for me. For example, there was the romance between the INS agent and the food driver. Come on now!! Who in their right mind would get married to a man so introverted and shy he can't even propose to you himself. Also, why would you accept the ring after not even seeing the guy or knowing what he's like. Completely unrealistic and too mushy. Then the Indian janitor jumping in front of the airplane. It's these kinds of things in the film that just come across as forced and annoying.I actually didn't notice it was a Spielberg film until the end credits and I was absolutely shocked. I have liked a lot of Spielberg's films and I have a great respect for him, but this was way below standards. Maybe he should just steer away from trying to make cutesy, romantic comedies.",2,This was a Spielberg film?????,1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,3113,"['film', 'started', 'out', 'potential', 'ended', 'mediocrity', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'lost', 'somewhere', 'feel', 'good', 'moments', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'cheesiness', 'film', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'forced', 'live', 'Charles', 'de', 'Gaulle', 'International', 'airport', 'Paris.The', 'story', 'out', 'Victor', 'Navorsky', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'being', 'denied', 'access', 'US', 'soil', 'landing', 'NY', 'Krakozhia', 'made', 'up', 'country', 'story', 'Krakozhia', 'essentially', 'not', 'exist', 'more', 'fallen', 'coup', 'passport', 'visa', 'are', 'rendered', 'useless', 'whole', 'story', 'essentially', 'Victor', 'day', 'day', 'struggle', 'survive', 'airport', 'Basically', 'story', 'fall', 'apart', 'as', 'soon', 'original', 'plot', 'surviving', 'wears', 'delve', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'subplots.Hanks', 'character', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'interesting', 'watch', 'was', 'intriguing', 'watching', 'come', 'up', 'ingenious', 'ideas', 'making', 'money', 'feed', 'different', 'ways', 'make', 'comfortable', 'Then', 'mystery', 'can', 'peanuts', 'whole', 'movie', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'very', 'end', 'what', 'contents', 'are.It', 'other', 'characters', 'draw', 'life', 'movie', 'opinion', 'Tucci', 'Dixon', 'airport', 'security', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'life', 'mission', 'make', 'Victor', 'life', 'living', 'hell', 'character', 'was', 'too', 'one', 'dimensional', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'typical', 'villain.Then', 'was', 'Catherine', 'Zita-Jones', 'character', 'played', 'flight', 'attendant', 'who', 'was', 'other', 'woman', 'love', 'triangle', 'married', 'man', 'character', 'was', 'egotistical', 'weak', 'minded', 'woman', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'break', 'away', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'break', 'away', 'destructive', 'situations', 'Again', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'one', 'dimensional', 'only', 'reason', 'could', 'see', 'Hanks', 'character', 'having', 'interest', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'sexual', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'movie', 'across', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'there', 'more', 'feeling', 'relationship', 'felt', 'nothing', 'two', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Hanks', 'Zeta-Jones', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'Hanks', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'have', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'example', 'Zeta-Jones', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'it.Then', 'were', 'subplots', 'other', 'airport', 'workers', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'WAY', 'top', 'example', 'was', 'romance', 'INS', 'agent', 'food', 'driver', 'Come', 'now', 'Who', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'get', 'married', 'man', 'so', 'introverted', 'shy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'propose', 'Also', 'why', 'would', 'accept', 'ring', 'not', 'even', 'seeing', 'guy', 'knowing', 'what', 'Completely', 'unrealistic', 'too', 'mushy', 'Then', 'Indian', 'janitor', 'jumping', 'front', 'airplane', 'kinds', 'things', 'film', 'just', 'come', 'across', 'forced', 'annoying.I', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'was', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'end', 'credits', 'was', 'absolutely', 'shocked', 'have', 'liked', 'lot', 'Spielberg', 'films', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'was', 'way', 'standards', 'Maybe', 'should', 'just', 'steer', 'away', 'trying', 'make', 'cutesy', 'romantic', 'comedies']",N/A
623977,A3399PIYZXPD0G,B00005JMYC,Steven Laine,"[8, 29]","The Terminal is an ordinary little movie that looks a heck of a lot like a TV sitcom. With Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks in charge, I expected much more entertainment.The plot is weak and silly beyond the basic premise of a man getting trapped by bureaucratic red tape and having to live inside the airport until his immigration status gets worked out. OK, I can accept that, but the main characters feel like they do various actions only because the script says to, not because it fits into their characters. Catherine Zeta-Jones looks fantastic, but plays a person who is very messed up at relationships on the inside. Her attraction to Hanks' character is not believable, nor is his to her. Tom plays a Jimmy Stewart type guy, so why would he be attracted to a stewardess who has affairs with married men and can't let go?Stanley Tucci plays a realistic airport security manager who has a few scenes to show he is really good at his job and a decent guy. However, to put some tension in the story he does some out-of-the-blue mean spirited things to make Hanks' life a little tougher to bump the story along. For all the money and talent that had to be available to pull this movie together, it just seems like a weak script.There are the typical ethnic sidekicks to the Tom Hanks character who strain to provide the standard initial comic relief, then enable the hero to reach his impossible goal, in this case the predictable Lady and the Tramp dinner with C Z-J in a romantic and out of the way part of JFK airport Right!One of these guys is an odd Indian janitor who ran away from India years before to escape arrest for knifing a cop, who takes delight in watching airport patrons slip and fall on his freshly mopped floors. He is paranoid and rude to the people he encounters, yet we are supposed to find him a sympathetic character because the script says he is. He seems more like a psychotic on the lam rather than a lovable eccentric from TV land. It just does not click very smoothly.The dialog is a little stale and clich&eacute;d, again sounding like a TV show, not a movie from the big guys. They also ran out of things to do to move the story along so they repeated the same things again. An example that comes to mind is the cracker and condiment supper that happens twice. The first time it was kind of a mild ""oh, gross!"" moment, but the second it stuck out as unnecessary and redundant. Again I found myself watching and wondering why the script was so thin.By the time Spielberg's name scrolls out in the credits in cursive the show felt contrived and long. This is not a poorly made movie, but a poorly designed one.

623978,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,B00005JMYC,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[5, 8]","Steven Spielberg's ""The Terminal"" is a surprisingly underwhelming effort from the master filmmaker.  It appeared to have all the ingredients needed to be a winner but it ended up just being a confused mess of cliches and loose ends.Krakozia citizen Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) flies in to the United States and is detained as soon as he lands.  It turns out his visa has been cancelled because there has been a military coup in his homeland.  Viktor therefore cannot lawfully enter the country.  Further complicating matters is that he cannot be deported home either because the United States is not recognizing the newly installed Krakozia government.  Due to this strange set of circumstances, Viktor finds himself trapped at the airport terminal until the situation is resolved.  To pass the time, he befriends the colorful airport employees around him and tries to gain the attention of the beautiful Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a flight attendant who frequently passes through his area.One cannot shake the feeling that ""The Terminal"" is unfinished.  Spielberg and Hanks do a great job of setting up Viktor's plight but after establishing his resourcefulness, the film disintegrates into a hodgepodge of subplots that only detract from the main story.  We just keep getting one dilemma after another that feel more at home on a television situation-comedy.  Also, when the reason for Viktor's journey to America is revealed, it just feels like an afterthought and is completely absent of any emotional resonance.  Hanks turns in a wonderful and charming performance and Zeta-Jones is radiant is her underdeveloped role.  Yet, the top-notch acting does not salvage ""The Terminal.""

Is it the best effort by Speilberg or Hanks? Not by a long shot. Is it somewhat predictable in parts? Absolutely.Viktor (Hanks), gets hung up in a ball of red tape when his homeland is pitched into a revolution at some point during his flight, leaving him without a valid Visa as his country is not officially recognized by the US or the UN during the coup.  So, he is not allowed to enter the US, and airport security has little choice but to leave him in the terminal at JFK airport.While stuck, Viktor learns to make the most of his situation, makes friends with the employees, and falls for a love troubled flight attendant played by Catherine Zeta-Jones.Without giving a whole lot more away, I will say that the romance is not the most believable I have seen on the screen. You just don't see hot stewardesses involving themselves with earnest foreign men, though you can accept it when you realize that yes, people will only see what it is they want to see when they are idealizing anyone, and Jones' Amelia is the type of woman that idealizes people, which is probably why she has been involved with a married man for nearly a decade. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty fun to watch, and Hanks' adventures in the airport run the gamut of emotion.Though fairly predictable and at times hard to swallow, this movie is well worth the watch, and I would watch it again given the chance.

Ding - that's what happened with this wretched pap.So, Tom Hanks, then. He plays a character called Viktor Navoski (he's foreign, you see?  All foreign people have names like that). Due to a war in his native country (some made up one to avoid offence, let's call it Loserville) he has to stay IN the airport and can't leave at all.What could have been a promising idea turns into the most mawkish, sentimental and downright STUPID movie I've ever had the misfortune to sit and scorn through. For a start, Viktor knows NO ENGLISH. Not one word. Not hello, goodbye - nothing. So how does he overcome this seemingly insomountable obstacle? He buys a book on the sitcom FRIENDS and learns EVERY WORD in the English language.  You'd think he'd maybe just learn the words to unfunny tag-along Phoebe's unfunny ""Smelly Cat"" song, and oft repeated catchphrases like ""How You Doin'"" or ""We Were On A Break"", but no. Now Viktor can talk in perfect, unbroken English, albeit now sounding like Bela Lugosi.That's just one of the many howlers in this movie. He sets up home in an abandoned area of the airport (you know, you think with 9/11 and stuff, the airport staff would be a bit more, like, observant) and turns it into his own little place. It would take a team of about six men a month to do what Viktor does in about two days.Add to that the inevitable, beyond tedious love story with Catherine Zeta Jones, who wouldn't be interested in someone like Viktor in a million years.

I don't see the need to mention what the plot of the film is since so many others before me have already done so quite well. While I really liked the sentimental purpose behind Viktor Navorsky's (played excellently by Tom Hanks) Christmastime visit to the United States, ""The Terminal"" drags along in an attempt to make an interesting light-hearted romantic comedy out of something that was loosely based on an actual event. This idea might have worked, given the right script. But this script was far from being the right one because it is very uneven, insipid and unconvincing.For example: Viktor understands absolutely NO ENGLISH when he initially arrives in the U.S. They aren't able to find him a translator at all during the course of the film??  How is it that he is able to learn how to pronounce words and educate himself well enough virtually overnight by comparing an English version of a book to one that he has in his language? Yet, as the film progresses, he STILL doesn't understand that the terminal director (Stanley Tucci) is giving him permission to leave, so he stays?Next: Viktor living in a section of the airport that is closed to the public and under renovation...where is the SECURITY guarding such a place in an international airport (this is supposed to be set in John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, NY), post-9/11 world?! For all they know, the guy could be a freaking terrorist.Then this: Him doing unauthorized contracting jobs without ever being questioned about it. And on top of that, he is able to land a job, being paid very well under the table by the contractors that are working in the airport. Hmmm.And this: The shy food handler (Diego Luna) that Viktor helps win the heart of the customs agent (Zoe Saldana) who never even seemed to notice him, and incidentally, this same customs agent shares information about her personal life with Viktor, a complete stranger (???)And this, too: Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) the flight attendant that Viktor is attracted to, who is having an affair with a married man, being so scatter-brained that she doesn't know which way is up. Hanks and Zeta-Jones have no on-screen chemistry AT ALL, either.And yet another one: The scene when Viktor is finally leaving the airport surrounded by all the friends he's made reminds you of something out of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and many other silly scenarios in the movie other than the ones I mentioned are straight out of the old Hollywood book of schlocky, somewhat happy endings.What was really frustrating about this movie (other than the length - it was about an hour and a half too long) was the way the ""relationship"" between Viktor and Amelia should have progressed, but didn't. The way things ended with them was too abrupt and didn't make sense. Seems like the writers concentrated so much on the things that Viktor was doing as a resident of the terminal throughout the film, they didn't know exactly how to resolve the Amelia situation, so they threw a cheesy and unsatisfying ending together. Bad idea. They would have done better to eliminate her character from the script altogether, since she really had no effect on the outcome of the movie.""The Terminal"" is far from being the worst movie ever made. But there are too many sub-plots in this film, and the trouble is that Spielberg tries to cram them all in, therefore making it way too long. I couldn't imagine having to go see this in the theaters, because I'm sure I would have either swirmed all the way through it or gotten up and walked out. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it just never did. Two and a half stars for the cast, which was unfortunately wasted here, and that's about it.",3,Dead on arrival,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,3851,"['Terminal', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'must-see', 'list', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'when', 'came', 'cable', 'recently', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'need', 'mention', 'what', 'plot', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'quite', 'well', 'really', 'liked', 'sentimental', 'purpose', 'Viktor', 'Navorsky', 'played', 'excellently', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Christmastime', 'visit', 'United', 'States', 'Terminal', 'along', 'attempt', 'make', 'interesting', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'something', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'actual', 'event', 'idea', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'given', 'right', 'script', 'script', 'was', 'far', 'being', 'right', 'one', 'very', 'uneven', 'insipid', 'unconvincing.For', 'example', 'Viktor', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'ENGLISH', 'when', 'initially', 'U.S', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'find', 'translator', 'course', 'film', 'How', 'able', 'learn', 'how', 'pronounce', 'words', 'educate', 'well', 'enough', 'virtually', 'overnight', 'comparing', 'English', 'version', 'book', 'one', 'language', 'Yet', 'film', 'STILL', ""n't"", 'understand', 'terminal', 'director', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'giving', 'permission', 'leave', 'Next', 'Viktor', 'living', 'section', 'airport', 'closed', 'public', 'renovation', 'where', 'SECURITY', 'guarding', 'place', 'international', 'airport', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'International', 'Airport', 'Queens', 'NY', 'post-9/11', 'world', 'know', 'guy', 'could', 'be', 'freaking', 'terrorist.Then', 'Him', 'doing', 'unauthorized', 'contracting', 'jobs', 'ever', 'being', 'questioned', 'top', 'able', 'land', 'job', 'being', 'paid', 'very', 'well', 'table', 'contractors', 'are', 'working', 'airport', 'shy', 'food', 'handler', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'Viktor', 'win', 'heart', 'customs', 'agent', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'who', 'never', 'even', 'seemed', 'notice', 'incidentally', 'same', 'customs', 'agent', 'shares', 'information', 'personal', 'life', 'Viktor', 'complete', 'stranger', 'too', 'Amelia', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Viktor', 'attracted', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'married', 'man', 'being', 'so', 'scatter-brained', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'up', 'Hanks', 'Zeta-Jones', 'have', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'AT', 'ALL', 'either.And', 'yet', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'Viktor', 'finally', 'leaving', 'airport', 'surrounded', 'friends', 'made', 'reminds', 'something', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'many', 'other', 'silly', 'scenarios', 'movie', 'other', 'ones', 'mentioned', 'are', 'straight', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'book', 'schlocky', 'somewhat', 'happy', 'was', 'really', 'frustrating', 'movie', 'other', 'length', 'was', 'hour', 'half', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'way', 'relationship', 'Viktor', 'Amelia', 'should', 'have', 'progressed', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'things', 'ended', 'was', 'too', 'abrupt', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'writers', 'concentrated', 'so', 'much', 'things', 'Viktor', 'was', 'doing', 'resident', 'terminal', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'resolve', 'Amelia', 'situation', 'threw', 'cheesy', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'together', 'Bad', 'idea', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'eliminate', 'character', 'script', 'altogether', 'really', 'had', 'effect', 'outcome', 'movie', 'Terminal', 'far', 'being', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'sub-plots', 'film', 'trouble', 'Spielberg', 'cram', 'therefore', 'making', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'having', 'go', 'see', 'theaters', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'swirmed', 'way', 'gotten', 'up', 'walked', 'out', 'kept', 'waiting', 'something', 'interesting', 'happen', 'just', 'never', 'did', 'Two', 'half', 'stars', 'cast', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'wasted', 'here']",N/A

While the supporting characters helped give the movie some life and added fun; Tom Hanks truly made this movie a hit for me and one that I will buy on DVD.  That privledge is saved only for my all-time-favorite films.The movie about a foreign man who is trapped in the airport due to his country being at war and now he's not able to get into the US...is heartwarming!  We see Tom's character trying to understand what's going on around him, not being able to speak much English.  We see him taking an impossible situation and making it bearable.  With such humor, persistence and wit- what may seem boring and mundane- things a person would do while ""stranded"" in an airport- Hanks makes funny and engaging!  And thanks to Catherine Zeta Jones, Hanks even finds a love interest which moves this plot into the final scene.I enjoyed this entire movie- beginning to end.  As much as I loved the end, I loved each part in between.  I thought the story was very well thought out and that it stayed on track.

Tom Hanks is perfect as Victor Navorski and acts so good, that you actually believe that he only can speak English the way he does in the movie. You really believe that he is a man from Kracozia.

You will see the great acting of people like Diego Luna, Stanley Tucci, Barry Shabaka Henley, Zoe Saldana and the extremely funny Kumar Pallana.The music also gives a great tone and feeling to the movie. John Williams has done a fantastic job once again.The set where the movie takes place is beautifully made.The production crew of the movie have made a complete airport terminal that looks just like a real airport!

While it not may be their best work together, The Terminal stands far above most of the movies released this year.  Viktor Navorski is flying to JFK Airport in New York when his home country, Krakozhia, is overthrown during a military coup.  Because of this, Navorski's passport, visa, and ticket are invalidated, meaning he can't go back home, and he can't go to the U.S.  The only option left is to stay in the international terminal of the airport.  Making the best of the situation, Viktor begins to learn English, learn the ways of the airport, and even get a job as a contractor with a group renovating parts of the airport.  Most importantly, Viktor begins to make an impact on the airport staff.  Meanwhile, the airport security director is trying to find a way to get Viktor out of his hair and out of the airport.  This is a very good, heartfelt movie.  And while it may not be Spielberg's best, it is still well worth a watch.Tom Hanks give an excellent performance as Viktor Navorski, a native of Krakozhia forced to live in JFK airport.  Like most of the characters he plays, Hanks' Viktor is incredibly likable.  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Amelia Warren, a stewardess who befriends Viktor.  Stanley Tucci plays Frank Dixon, the airport chief of security who wants the popular Viktor out of his terminal.  Chi McBride, Diego Luna, and Kumar Pallana are excellent in supporting roles as airport staff that become Viktor's friends during his stay in the airport.  If you buy the DVD, beware because there are two different widescreen copies available.  One offers just the movie while the other offers widescreen presentation and plenty of great extras including interviews with Hanks and Spielberg.  I recommend the one with extras for a deeper look at the movie.

623992,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00005JMYC,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","I'm a sucker for airports and airport movies. There's something about the mixture of giant architecture and masses of strangers either in constant motion or enforced inertia that implies that anything can happen. All human emotion is there - joy, hope, sorrow, anger - frustrations mix with small triumphs and plans are alternately thwarted or triumph. Therefore 'The Terminal' was a real surprise - an almost total misfire from Steven Spielberg that fails to work on almost every level.Spielberg has never made a really bad film before (even his weaker efforts have had something going for them), but he's finally pulled it off here. So much is so wrong about this film it's hard to know where to start. The script is a major offender, trite and ineffectual at every turn and so desperate to reaffirm belief in America post 9/11 as a land of such open heart and infinite wonders, populated entirely by nice people that you really can't understand why anyone would possibly want to leave the airport it's just so gosh darned nice. Rather than an impersonal prison merely impersonating life, the airport becomes a playground where magical things happen if you only look. It's so resolutely upbeat and unreal, it's depressing. Worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Spielberg has no real feel for his location: it's just a giant set that never once convinces for all it's detail.Speilberg's direction is surprisingly poor. He always had the ability to convey fear and confusion - think E.T. lost in the woods or Jim wandering through the chaotic streets of Shanghai as the Japanese overrun the city - but he's completely lost that in the opening scenes. Instead of panic and alienation we get a very flat succession of shots that end up in a technically impressive crane shot revealing the entire set but which leaves us feeling nothing, let alone identifying with the hero. Part of this is admittedly due to the fact that Hanks' performance starts out both terrible AND insulting - hey, those crazy East Europeans aren't just stupid children, they can't even walk properly: they waddle like clockwork toy ducks! - but that does at least improve as the film continues.The supporting cast are equally unbelievable despite the cast's best efforts. Is it really credible that two airport workers would actually marry without ever having even met, let alone been on a date on the strength of Viktor's skills as a romantic go-between? (Considering how nauseatingly phoney the scene where she reveals the engagement ring is, perhaps it would have been better if they had never met.) Even the obstreperous janitor who loves to watch passengers slip up on his floor turns out to be a loveable cop-killer with great juggling skills (no really) who spreads the legend of Viktor's great deeds in the single worst-staged scenes in Spielberg's entire career.Strangely enough, the only one who really shines here is Catherine Zeta Jones, an extremely limited and somewhat self-important screen presence in most films but who somehow manages to be refreshingly believable despite being saddled with some truly terrible dialog (her `like' story with Hanks is peppered with inane references to Napoleon and Josephine). The resolution to their relationship is the film's one surprise.Worse is to come in the tacked on finale. Endings are always Spielberg's Achilles heel, but this one is just an insult. For no rational reason whatsoever, Stanley Tucci's character acts in an unnecessarily malicious way simply to provide some sense of dramatic tension. Naturally, it fails miserably because we know everyone in the airport loves Viktor too much to go through with Tucci's moustache-twirling dastardliness (ok, he has no moustache, but that's merely an oversight).A blandly impressive package of extras (that scrupulously ignore the much more tragic true story that inspired it) are included.",2,One of Spielberg's few real failures,1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,3873,"[""'m"", 'sucker', 'airports', 'airport', 'movies', 'something', 'mixture', 'giant', 'architecture', 'masses', 'strangers', 'constant', 'motion', 'enforced', 'inertia', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'human', 'emotion', 'joy', 'hope', 'sorrow', 'anger', 'frustrations', 'mix', 'small', 'triumphs', 'plans', 'are', 'alternately', 'thwarted', 'triumph', ""'The"", 'Terminal', 'was', 'real', 'surprise', 'almost', 'total', 'misfire', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'work', 'almost', 'level.Spielberg', 'never', 'made', 'really', 'bad', 'film', 'even', 'weaker', 'efforts', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'going', 'finally', 'pulled', 'off', 'here', 'So', 'much', 'so', 'wrong', 'film', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'start', 'script', 'major', 'offender', 'trite', 'ineffectual', 'turn', 'so', 'desperate', 'reaffirm', 'belief', 'America', 'post', '9/11', 'land', 'such', 'open', 'heart', 'infinite', 'wonders', 'populated', 'entirely', 'nice', 'people', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'possibly', 'want', 'leave', 'airport', 'just', 'so', 'gosh', 'darned', 'nice', 'Rather', 'impersonal', 'prison', 'merely', 'impersonating', 'life', 'airport', 'playground', 'where', 'magical', 'things', 'happen', 'only', 'look', 'so', 'resolutely', 'upbeat', 'unreal', 'depressing', 'Worse', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'Spielberg', 'real', 'feel', 'location', 'just', 'giant', 'set', 'never', 'once', 'convinces', 'detail.Speilberg', 'direction', 'surprisingly', 'poor', 'always', 'had', 'ability', 'convey', 'fear', 'confusion', 'think', 'E.T', 'lost', 'woods', 'Jim', 'wandering', 'chaotic', 'streets', 'Shanghai', 'Japanese', 'overrun', 'city', 'completely', 'lost', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Instead', 'panic', 'alienation', 'get', 'very', 'flat', 'succession', 'shots', 'end', 'up', 'technically', 'impressive', 'crane', 'shot', 'revealing', 'entire', 'set', 'feeling', 'nothing', 'let', 'alone', 'identifying', 'hero', 'Part', 'admittedly', 'due', 'fact', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'out', 'terrible', 'insulting', 'hey', 'crazy', 'East', 'Europeans', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'stupid', 'children', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'walk', 'properly', 'waddle', 'clockwork', 'toy', 'ducks', 'least', 'improve', 'film', 'continues.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'equally', 'unbelievable', 'cast', 'best', 'efforts', 'really', 'credible', 'two', 'airport', 'workers', 'would', 'actually', 'marry', 'ever', 'having', 'even', 'met', 'let', 'alone', 'been', 'date', 'strength', 'Viktor', 'skills', 'romantic', 'go-between', 'Considering', 'how', 'nauseatingly', 'scene', 'where', 'engagement', 'ring', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'never', 'met', 'Even', 'obstreperous', 'janitor', 'who', 'watch', 'passengers', 'slip', 'up', 'floor', 'out', 'be', 'loveable', 'cop-killer', 'great', 'juggling', 'skills', 'really', 'who', 'legend', 'Viktor', 'great', 'deeds', 'single', 'worst-staged', 'scenes', 'Spielberg', 'entire', 'career.Strangely', 'enough', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'shines', 'here', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'extremely', 'limited', 'somewhat', 'self-important', 'screen', 'presence', 'most', 'films', 'who', 'somehow', 'manages', 'be', 'refreshingly', 'believable', 'being', 'saddled', 'truly', 'terrible', 'dialog', 'story', 'Hanks', 'peppered', 'inane', 'references', 'Napoleon', 'Josephine', 'resolution', 'relationship', 'film', 'one', 'surprise.Worse', 'come', 'tacked', 'finale', 'Endings', 'are', 'always', 'Spielberg', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'one', 'just', 'insult', 'rational', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'character', 'unnecessarily', 'malicious', 'way', 'simply', 'provide', 'sense', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Naturally', 'miserably', 'know', 'everyone', 'airport', 'Viktor', 'too', 'much', 'go', 'Tucci', 'moustache-twirling', 'dastardliness', 'ok', 'moustache', 'merely', 'oversight', 'blandly', 'impressive', 'package', 'extras', 'scrupulously', 'ignore', 'much', 'more', 'tragic', 'true', 'story', 'inspired', 'are', 'included']",N/A

With someone else on board, I would give this lukewarm film three or more stars.  With them, never.The protagonist of his film has a model: a certain Iranian person living in Charles De Gaulle Airpoit in France, who must be still living there.  He came from Iran as refugee, lost his passport, and has been staying in the airport for more than 15 years.In 'The Terminal,' Tom Hanks is Viktor Navorski, a traveller from a fictional country (probably former USSR in mind) Krakozia, where a military uprising leads to a revolution.  Technically, this country is gone, in other words, and Viktor is stuck in JFK Airport, with his return ticket and passport taken away by the authority Frank Dixon, played by hugely underrated Stanley Tucci.Now, let me ask -- Do you really believe in this story?  Tom Hanks, whose looks no other than Tom Hanks, an American, plays a guy from Easten Europe.  That requires great amount of suspention of disbelief.  Moreover, because of the reasons I don't know, Frank Dixon in chrage of the airport security, who needs promotion desperately, always misses the right choice when handling this possible political refugee, as if this guy must be the arch-villain to this sweet, too sweet Hanks.  And to add to that, the film gives us a love interest in Catherine Zeta-Jones as flight attentant, whose acting is utterly bland.Think this way.  Why does not Dixon call for someone who can interprete Viktor's language much sooner?  Why does not Viktor leave the place when it is very, very easy to do?  And most of all, after the events of Sep. 11th, why let this guy roam in the international airport in America?  In Paris, maybe.  In today's America, not a chance.  And this film is made in America.No wonder they changed the film's ending.  No wonder it received mixed reviews from critics (though they are stil too kind to this film).  The film had no chance from the start to convince us of what it tries to show.  In addition to these too improbable situations, 'The Terminal' is too sugar-coated and toothless.

He is detained at JFK in New York because his home country is undergoing a revolution. Viktor's papers and passport no longer have any validity and he therefore cannot enter the United States. However, he can't return home either because his life could be in danger (and he's also on a mission). So, he ends up living in the airport terminal, befriending the staff and becoming somewhat of a local celebrity.The movie is full of comical moments. However, it also has its serious side. The acting in the film is top notch, especially by the supporting cast, as is Spielberg's direction (we wouldn't expect anything less). There are a few corny lines of dialogue here and there, but overall the script is good. Catherine Zeta-Jones' clumsy stewardess character comes off as annoying at times, but doesn't distract from the overall theme of the movie.THE TERMINAL is comical, somewhat romantic, and even dramatic at times. It delves into how people build relationships with each other and slightly pokes fun of our mass consumer culture. However, the heart and soul of the movie has very little to do with those things. THE TERMINAL is one of the best movies to ever be made about how to live a life of honor. Viktor is a man who lives a life of honor. He lives by his Trouthe--when he gives his word he means it; his word is his bond. There was a time not so long ago when people would say something, they would mean it--if a person made a promise, they kept it. We've lost that virtue and there aren't very many people who are truly living an honorable life.

Cast Away was an ambitious film, trying to decipher what a human being is when he is casted away from his beloved society.  This film is basically just trying to do the same thing.  Tom Hanks' character, Victor, is stuck in the JFK airport until his war-torn country is at peace.  He cannot understand the people he is surrounded by and they cannot understand him.  He must navigate his way around his new surroundings and figure out how he must survive.He does so by learning.  He doesn't sit on his butt and mope.  He gets up, learns his surroundings, and adjusts his way of life.  He makes friends with several of the airport employees, who provide hime with food, entertaintainment and friendship.Now in real life, just as Stanley Tucci's character believes, most people would simply try to escape from the airport.  But the most remarkable thing about Victor, and Tom Hanks, is that for some reason he is able to be patient and wait for his allowance into NYC, and we actually believe that he is that good and patient of a man to actually wait.The story and script are somewhat old-fashioned and quaint but it gives the film a certain charm that new films seems to have lost.

First of all, of course, the concept that someone could be stuck in a terminal for months, working as a carpenter, setting up a bachelor pad at Gate 67, etc. etc., is ludicrous. But let's suspend disbelief. Even if you buy the premise, it still gets in the way of the movie's success.It seems that Spielberg wanted to cram as many subplots as possible under this umbrella, but a couple of them are much more compelling than the others -- namely, the love plot between Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna) and Officer Torres (Zoe Saldana) which Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) sweetly facilitiates, and Viktor's rescue of a Russian compatriot from the grips of the evil Frank Dixon's (Stanley Tucci's) grasp as he attempt to carry life-saving medicine from Canada back to his father in the homeland. The rest of the film is a falling off.If only Spielberg had known where to stop. But of course, there has to be the obligatory romance between Viktor and the ingenue Amelia Warren (the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones) -- which, again of course, cannot work out or how could the movie end?

In fact, there were a few big laughs. But on a scale of 1 to 10, the film was a 6. I say this because, besides the premise, there was nothing that original.The love story at its core is conventional. And at the end, Catherine Zeta-Jones' character seems to be more of a plot device than an actual person (the final look makes you go, ""I get it, but...why?""). I did like Tom Hanks. He made you want to love his character. The rest of the cast is basically good. Stanly Tucci --who Oscar-watchers predicted would be nominated-- is, unfortunately, a one-note character with an inexplicable, slight revelation towards the end. I give Tucci credit for understanding how unreasonably annoying and cruel his character is.The story is touching, to an extent. This is probably director Steven Speilberg's sappiest film I've ever seen. However, there are problems with the plot, thanks to uneven writing. And unfortunately, despite being based on a true story, it seems to have no purpose other than to entertain the masses, which isn't all bad, of course. But as far as being well-made, well...it's just not. I blame that on Speilberg. I think he could have made better choices for time. He could have cut things out, made the film shorter and more beleivable (which it wasn't, by the way). I'm beginning to think that he felt he was making a masterpiece when what he was given didn't have the potential to be more than pure entertainment. If my theory happens to be true, then I can see why some things were left in. He wanted to send a messege about...well, I'm not too sure what he was trying to say. But whatever it was, it wasn't conveyed well.Despite all this, there were upsides. As I had previously mentioned, Tom Hanks was great, there were many laughs, a few of them large. But what stands out is the production design. It's fantastic, I mean it just drew me in completely. And I was shocked to hear that it was so realistic that those who worked on the film during shooting persuaded someone to allow the merchandise to be for sale. Apparently, people shopped in there, despite the terminal being no more than a set built in two very large hangers. You'll have to see the film for yourself. It's truly breath-taking. I don't think Roger Ebert is right in saying, ""Whoever designed these sets will surely win the Oscar,"" because AMPAS doesn't seem to give the Art/Set Design award to films that aren't period or epics set in the past. But if I ran the Oscars, I would most definitely award the Terminal for its outstanding acheivement in production design.So I recommend The Terminal to those of you who are looking for basic entertainment with slight --very slight-- flare. I have to admit, it did make me smile. Movies don't necessarily have to be well-made to be entertaining.",3,Funny.

Even though his predicament establishes an unforgettable quandary to build a film around, Spielberg felt the need to create an antagonist whose motivations to harm Hanks really can't be explained.  Viewers will understand why the head of the airport (Stanley Tucci) wants to follow all rules concerning his new stranded guest, but once he becomes obsessed with Viktor and tries to sabotage his plans for survival, his actions can't be realistically explained.  Spielberg commits one of the most common faults of writers/directors: he builds a character who works more as a agent of the plot than as someone to help tell the story naturally.The movie is not a total disaster.  Many laugh out loud moments are found among this most unique of comic situations.  Some of the resourceful and creative ways the isolated immigrant survives in the airport will remind many of Hanks in ""Castaway"".  At times, the heavily populated terminal presents a more desolate environment than the abandoned island Hanks inhabited in that film (at least there he always had his volleyball).Hanks and Spielberg continue their trend of making films that speak to issues of importance.  While Viktor's introduction to America is not the common experience of immigrants, he works as a metaphor for the ills of the endless and illogical bureaucracy awaiting the ""tired, poor, huddled masses"" coming to the USA.",3,Doesn't meet expectations set for Hanks and Spielberg,1104019200,"12 26, 2004",2004,2053,"['set-up', 'Terminal', 'who', 'hear', 'Eastern', 'European', 'flies', 'America', 'only', 'have', 'government', 'country', 'overthrown', 'flight', 'thus', 'voided', 'validity', 'passport', 'stranded', 'airport', 'US', 'government', 'can', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'fascinating', 'plotline', 'add', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'lead', 'role', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'man', 'camera', 'recipe', 'magical', 'film', 'right', 'Well', 'not', 'exactly.The', 'architects', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'trust', 'story', 'carry', 'add', 'many', 'manufactured', 'tired', 'conflicts', 'drag', 'audience', 'wait', 'see', 'fate', 'Hanks', 'Viktor', 'Even', 'predicament', 'unforgettable', 'quandary', 'build', 'film', 'around', 'Spielberg', 'felt', 'need', 'create', 'antagonist', 'motivations', 'harm', 'Hanks', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'explained', 'Viewers', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'head', 'airport', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'follow', 'rules', 'concerning', 'new', 'stranded', 'guest', 'once', 'obsessed', 'Viktor', 'tries', 'sabotage', 'plans', 'survival', 'actions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'realistically', 'explained', 'Spielberg', 'one', 'most', 'common', 'faults', 'writers/directors', 'character', 'who', 'more', 'agent', 'plot', 'someone', 'help', 'tell', 'story', 'naturally.The', 'movie', 'not', 'total', 'disaster', 'Many', 'out', 'loud', 'moments', 'are', 'found', 'most', 'unique', 'comic', 'situations', 'resourceful', 'creative', 'ways', 'isolated', 'immigrant', 'survives', 'airport', 'will', 'remind', 'many', 'Hanks', 'Castaway', 'times', 'heavily', 'populated', 'terminal', 'presents', 'more', 'desolate', 'environment', 'abandoned', 'island', 'Hanks', 'inhabited', 'film', 'least', 'always', 'had', 'volleyball', '.Hanks', 'Spielberg', 'continue', 'trend', 'making', 'films', 'speak', 'issues', 'importance', 'Viktor', 'introduction', 'America', 'not', 'common', 'experience', 'immigrants', 'metaphor', 'ills', 'endless', 'illogical', 'bureaucracy', 'awaiting', 'tired', 'poor', 'huddled', 'masses', 'coming', 'USA']",N/A
